[00:00] rauchg_: mnot: spec != real world
[00:00] rauchg_: now this is becoming a classic multiple headers debate haha
[00:00] rauchg_: we could set up async bots to do this job for us
[00:00] mnot: rauchg_: yeah, sure. But the object of that spec is to give advice to real world implementers.
[00:00] ryan[WIN] has joined the channel
[00:01] mnot: rauchg_: …and basically what it now says is that if you send multi-line headers, they probably won't work.
[00:02] floby has joined the channel
[00:02] mnot: rauchg_: so I'm not sure what the debate is about; everybody knows they don't really interop.

[00:04] rauchg_: that's another draft right there
[00:04] mjr_: mnot: the debate is how node should handle parsing and storing headers that are specified multiple times.  It ends up being slower to put them all in their own array.
[00:04] mnot: rauchg_: you're talking about folding multiple headers into one comma-separated header; aha
[00:04] mnot: rauchg_: not folding header fields themselves
[00:05] creationix: zzak: I did
[00:05] mnot: what does "put them all in their own array" mean?
[00:05] zzak: grats ^^
[00:05] mnot: you mean an array of key, value tuples — each corresponding to a single header line (NOT key)?
[00:06] creationix: what did I start
[00:06] creationix: oh noes
[00:06] mnot: creationix: it's been going on for years, don't worry, you didn't start it ;)
[00:06] creationix: ryah: I'll come up with something minimal and sane
[00:06] charlenopires has joined the channel
[00:07] mnot: my position is that node is a low-layer HTTP implementation, and that therefore the data structure for headers has to loose reasonably little information
[00:07] ossareh_ has joined the channel
[00:07] mnot: I'd really like to see numbers that the data structure I described above causes real-world perf problems, because my testing didn't show any.

[00:09] mnot: creationix: if you haven't already, see thread on nodejs-dev starting in early Nov, "Changing HTTP headers"
[00:09] creationix: oh, I remember
[00:09] mnot: creationix: cookies are a special case (also called out in HTTPbis). Hopefully it's only them, but as it's said, hope is not a strategy.
[00:10] Teravus: Question, where would someone ask about consulting and possibly contracting with a node.js 'expert'?
[00:10] vilhonen has joined the channel
[00:10] creationix: Teravus: you could try the node.js mailing list
[00:10] creationix: or in here
[00:10] tlrobinson has joined the channel
[00:11] Teravus: Ok, thanks much.
[00:11] creationix: mnot: so the implementation I have half done at the moment stores the headers as a simple array of strings
[00:11] creationix: the key and value are already combined into a single line
[00:11] maushu has joined the channel
[00:11] Teravus: I was originally going to send the company to the list, however I wanted to see if there was a specific place that that kind of question goes.   Some projects have that :).
[00:11] creationix: I also have an external index with keys toLowerCase()ed to quick lookup
[00:11] mnot: creationix: I saw moderate overhead in doing so, and as you've noticed, that's an issue for cookies (and possibly other badly-behaved headers)
[00:12] Teravus: Thanks much.
[00:12] creationix: mnot: not an array per unique header, but a single array for the entire response
[00:12] jdrannbauer has joined the channel
[00:12] creationix: Teravus: there is a nodejs job-board out there, but I'm not sure how much traffic it gets
[00:13] Vertice has joined the channel
[00:13] mnot: creationix: ah, can you give a short example?
[00:13] Country has joined the channel
[00:13] matyr has joined the channel
[00:14] creationix: so headers = ["Content-Type: text/html", "Set-Cookie: SID=123981723498", "Set-Cookie: lang=en-US; Path=/"]
[00:14] mjr_: creationix: that sounds simple enough, but then you'd need some kind of headers.get("Content-Type")
[00:14] mjr_: ?
[00:14] creationix: and index = {"content-type": 0, "set-cookie": [1, 2]}
[00:14] creationix: mjr_: right
[00:14] mnot: mjr_: I'm assuming that a bunch of utility functions will be necessary
[00:14] creationix: that's the part I have implemented
[00:14] creationix: but the edge cases get nasty
[00:14] mjr_: Otherwise users will have to do headers.indexOf("key") themselves
[00:15] mnot: eventually with some perf optimisations
[00:15] creationix: mnot: right, the headers array and the index would be private data
[00:15] mjr_: You know, putting them in an array, exactly as received, would fix the downcasing thing, as well as the mysterious reordering issues.
[00:15] mnot: creationix: so, I think the only place where we differ is on the list items; I'd like to see the colon and any whitespace parsed out, so you have a list of name, value tuples
[00:15] creationix: otherwise the index could get out of date with the headers list
[00:16] creationix: mjr_: esactely
[00:16] creationix: mnot: right, but that's too expensive
[00:16] mjr_: I can't believe we are having the multiple headers debate again.
[00:16] mnot: how so? you'll have to parse out the name, value each time you want to do something
[00:16] creationix: mnot: no I dont, the index has the name, already normalized even
[00:17] creationix: only if you want to read the value and then it's a simple substr
[00:17] mnot: oh, I see, missed that part
[00:17] mnot: hmm
[00:17] Teravus: the edge cases of HTTP do get nasty :)
[00:17] mnot: well, if you're going to go that far, why not preserve case in the header field-name?
[00:17] creationix: the hard part is doing things like deleting just a single instance of Set-Cookie
[00:17] mnot: ah, you do
[00:17] creationix: how in the world does the user specify which one they want to remove
[00:18] prettyrobots has joined the channel
[00:18] mnot: so, what I like about this approach is that there's very little information loss; really, only the line delimitation (\r\n vs. \n) and possibly end-of-line whitespace (depending on how you do it)
[00:18] creationix: and is removing a single set-Cookie header even something that we need to support
[00:18] mnot: which are only useful in very specific use cases (e.g., HTTP analysis tools)
[00:18] creationix: mnot: this isn't for parsing, but I guess the same api could be used there too
[00:19] creationix: I'm doing this for http response headers
[00:19] mnot: it'd really need to be the same data structure / api across the board, I think
[00:19] creationix: true
[00:19] Teravus: ACTION was working on C# WebServer (http://webserver.codeplex.com/), getting it to support a very specific thread model as part of his work on OpenSimulator.... and the edge cases are usually a result of the expectation that servers need to handle improper use of the protocol gracefully.
[00:19] creationix: I might not get this in time for 0.4.0
[00:19] creationix: oh well
[00:20] creationix: the release cycle seems fast enough
[00:20] mnot: ok, well my only feedback at this point is that if you don't split out the names and values ahead of time, make sure that whitespace is rejected before the colon wherever it occurs; it's a security issue.
[00:21] creationix: mnot: how is it dangerous?
[00:21] mnot: creationix: because whitespace isn't supposed to appear there, and different implementations strip it differently
[00:22] creationix: and wouldn't ryah's http parser reject such invalid data anyway?
[00:22] mnot: so that "Content-Length : 0" might appear as two different headers, depending on who's parsing it
[00:22] mnot: that allows an injection attack
[00:22] mnot: good question; I dont' remember ATM
[00:22] mnot: but you also need to make sure someone doesn't send one
[00:22] creationix: and you're talking about parsing headers, not generating headers, right?
[00:22] creationix: hmm
[00:22] mnot: well, it's probably best to error on it
[00:23] skm has joined the channel
[00:23] mnot: anyway, I'm interested to see how complex it'll become; that seems like the potential risk here
[00:23] ceej has joined the channel
[00:23] creationix: so what, if any changes, should I try to get in for 0.4.0?
[00:24] creationix: I don't want to add sugar that we later have to undo to support multiple headers
[00:24] mnot: ryah? I thought it was more or less closed...
[00:24] Teravus: Thanks for the tip, I hope your day has been fun and productive :)

[00:27] creationix: mnot: https://gist.github.com/c3d8a34e7044170d7bd7
[00:27] creationix: I haven't settled on a good API for the multiple headers case, it seems to be a very difficult problem
[00:27] mnot: yes
[00:28] creationix: but I'm sure having a return value that changes type is bad
[00:28] mnot: a correct solution isn't very programmer-friendly
[00:28] mnot: yes
[00:28] creationix: in this version, I have getHeader(name) which always returns the first header or undefined and getHeaders(name) which always returns an array (zero or more items)
[00:29] creationix: so it smooths over some of the insanity
[00:29] mnot: this is what I stopped on a few months ago: https://github.com/mnot/node/commit/71c158e933416c2ac8bccd57ccca9790f4086173

[00:32] mnot: they tend to get really complex and nasty :)

[00:37] cshzt: still bothers me the Ruby / Rails legacy, which I never had, with Node
[00:38] chapel: hmm
[00:38] mnot: right. the important thing here is to make sure that the actual data representation doesn't lose information and doesn't block (e.g., by performing suck-ily). Everything else is noise; people can add onto it as they want.
[00:38] cshzt: torvalamo, yo, motherfucker, just bring it
[00:38] creationix: my opinion (which I have experience to back up) is that any API that tries to be everything for everyone will fail to be anything for anyone and impossible to maintain
[00:39] mnot: creationix: agreed
[00:39] torvalamo: i brought it to your mother, isn't that enough?
[00:39] creationix: small, simple, and high-quality tools get out of the way and let work get done
[00:39] creationix: mnot: right, I want the simplest tool that enables developers to do whatever they want
[00:40] creationix: it's not node's job to develop a full stack web framework for you
[00:40] mnot: the practical problem is that if it's too low-level, people will complain that node doesn't ship with useable tools for the 80% case. But I think adding a few tools that are optional to use and don't get in the way of folks who just want the low-level data representation should address that.
[00:40] creationix: but it is node's job to allow you to send multiple headers if it's needed
[00:40] mnot: yup
[00:40] chapel: can someone look at this and answer the question? https://gist.github.com/e6c665f921ccf97d9714
[00:41] cshzt: node ships with everything I need as an experienced programmer

[01:01] isaacs: ryah: oh, i guess the "Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call" stuff is unnecessary, since "hasOwnProperty" isn't a valid abs path anyhow.

[01:33] mscdex: lol
[01:33] ryah: this week
[01:34] iszak: excellent.
[01:34] ryah: with or without bugs
[01:34] ryah: :)
[01:34] mscdex: !
[01:34] creationix: bugs can be fixed later, but API needs to be stable
[01:34] iszak: ryah, is there a set release circle for versions? e.g. every two weeks a minor release.
[01:34] mscdex: bugs? i thought they were features :O
[01:34] ryah: every week for minor
[01:34] iszak: I thought so, someone tried to say otherwise.
[01:35] iszak: How different is the API from 0.2.x to 0.4.x?

[01:35] zentoooo has joined the channel
[01:35] creationix: woot! https://creationix.com:8000/wordle.jpg
[01:35] iszak: Because if we can write a regular expression to find and replace the API.
[01:35] creationix: ryah: ^
[01:36] Sebmaster: ryah: with platform_cygwin.cc?
[01:37] ryah: sigh
[01:37] ryah: no, i don't think so
[01:37] hornairs has joined the channel
[01:37] Sebmaster: oO a stable release without win support?
[01:37] Sebmaster: or is the mingw build working?
[01:38] ryah: mingw is kind of working
[01:38] ryah: creationix: yeah - still kind of broken
[01:39] creationix: what's that?
[01:39] ryah: i still can't get websockets working
[01:39] creationix: websockets over tls?
[01:39] creationix: that's a shame, but not a show-stopper
[01:40] ryah: it's indicative of bigger bugs though
[01:40] creationix: think the bugs might be fixed in the next couple months?
[01:41] ryah: going to try to fix it now :P
[01:41] mscdex: SubStack: ping
[01:41] creationix: ryah: that works too
[01:41] creationix: let me know if you need more testing

[01:42] chapel: yay, Im going to be able to do proper https uploading !!!
[01:43] chapel: ryah++
[01:43] v8bot:  chapel has given a beer to ryah. ryah now has 2 beers.
[01:43] iszak: mscdex, why would anyone migrate to 0.3 from 0.2? most people like stability.
[01:43] creationix: the 0.3 API is what 0.4 will be
[01:43] mscdex: yep
[01:43] mscdex: :)
[01:43] davidthings: ryan, thanks for the TLS fix.  Working now for me now too.
[01:43] creationix: it's no longer 0.3 as soon as it's deemed stable, but it's the same API
[01:44] bingomanatee: ACTION has yet to see a stable release of bingomanatee
[01:44] iszak: mscdex, but thanks
[01:44] thrumins: met with ioventures!
[01:45] davidthings: ryah, I meant, of course.

[01:49] piscisaureus: yeah. I have only two. Was distracted by youtube hehe
[01:50] chapel: 2 here as well
[01:50] chapel: I would love 3
[01:50] chapel: two 30" and one 24" vertical
[01:50] ryah: isaacs:
[01:50] ryah: stat("/home/ryan/src/Socket.IO-node/index", 0x7fff56117d20) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

[01:50] ryah: stat("/home/ryan/src/Socket.IO-node/index.js", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=44, ...}) = 0

[01:50] ryah: open("/home/ryan/src/Socket.IO-node/index.js", O_RDONLY) = 5
[01:50] ryah: how come there is a stat and then a n lstat?
[01:50] iszak: chapel, three 23" here, wanted to get 1440p tho
[01:50] isaacs: hm.  good question.
[01:50] dominic_ has joined the channel
[01:50] chapel: ah
[01:50] chapel: I have a 1080p 24"
[01:51] isaacs: ryah: oh, right, because the "stat" is to see if it's a thing, and then the lstat is to realpath the thing that it is
[01:51] chapel: and an old 20" 1050
[01:51] isaacs: ryah: if it's a symbolic link to something that doesn't exist, then teh stat will fail
[01:51] ryah: what if we realpath() something that doesn't exist?
[01:51] isaacs: ryah: it'll fail, but slower.
[01:52] isaacs: ryah: well, in this case, at the same speed, i guess
[01:52] isaacs: since the rest is already cached
[01:52] taters has joined the channel
[01:52] ryah: but persumably one less stat?
[01:52] ryah: i.e. if we don't check to see if the thing is there first
[01:52] iszak: chapel, you jelly?
[01:52] chapel: I jelly?
[01:52] chapel: like the insoles?
[01:53] iszak: jelly => jealous
[01:53] chapel: am I jealous? of who?
[01:53] iszak has joined the channel
[01:53] chapel: maybe of ryah for being such a badass
[01:53] iszak: ryah, ahaha don't like memes :P
[01:53] ryah: ;)
[01:54] piscisaureus: since when can you get kicked here. lol. should do that more often.
[01:54] piscisaureus: v8bot should have a counter
[01:54] iszak: I'm amazed Joyent hasn't asked for Topic space.
[01:54] ryah: isaacs: basically i want to know if statPath is necessary, can't we just call realpathSync instead ?
[01:55] chapel: hmm, did someone get kicked?
[01:55] chapel: I have join/parts ignored

[01:57] creationix: ACTION is taking a break to eat...
[01:58] isaacs: ryah: sure, we can
[01:58] isaacs: ryah: that's fine.
[01:58] iszak: isaacs, did that feature end up getting implemented?
[01:58] isaacs: iszak: which ?
[01:58] iszak: versions range.
[01:59] chapel: who runs the logger?
[01:59] chapel: oh, I had an idea for a webirc client, but where a bot would sit in the channel always logging the channel, and someone could come to the website and see whats happening in channel, if they wanted to talk, they could click a button and it would log them in under their own session and username, but seamlessly
[02:00] ryah: isaacs: want to add it to your patch?
[02:00] isaacs: yeah, sure
[02:00] ryah: sweet
[02:00] ryah: git reset --hard HEAD^
[02:00] isaacs: ryah: oh, wait...
[02:01] isaacs: ryah: we also want to know that it's not a dir, that's why
[02:01] isaacs:   if (stats && !stats.isDirectory()) {
[02:01] ryah: i see..
[02:01] piscisaureus: is there no syscall on posix that combines lstat and readlink?
[02:01] isaacs: hm... maybe it'd be nice to have a realpathSyncThatReturnsStatAndPath?
[02:01] isaacs: but probably named something different?
[02:02] ryah: realpathSync(path, { allowDirs: false })
[02:02] ryah: :)
[02:02] isaacs: heh.
[02:02] ryah: okay, nevermind. we can have an extra syscall
[02:02] isaacs: that'd be easy, if you're srsly suggesting it.

[02:36] piscisaureus: cd ..
[02:36] piscisaureus: :-)
[02:36] isaacs: piscisaureus: since there's no path.split
[02:36] piscisaureus: oh
[02:37] isaacs: well, no, let's say i wanted to figure out just from a string, what all the parent dirs would be.
[02:37] isaacs: is that even possible?
[02:37] isaacs: i guess i could keep calling dirname()
[02:37] isaacs: but doesn't hte path show up with \ instead of /?
[02:37] piscisaureus: isaacs: either is correct on windows
[02:37] piscisaureus: just use path.split(/\\\//)
[02:38] piscisaureus: oh just use path.split(/[\\\/]/)
[02:38] isaacs: hm, i see.
[02:38] piscisaureus: but you need to be careful with the first elements you get out
[02:38] Ratty_: If it's cygwin then it's unix style paths anyway
[02:38] isaacs: but \ is not correct on posix
[02:38] isaacs: Ratty_: right, but then the process.platform will be "cygwin" not "win32"
[02:38] piscisaureus: isaacs: you can also try path.resolve(path, "..") to get the next parent path
[02:38] isaacs: i'm ok with splitting it and doing it two ways
[02:38] Ratty_: ah
[02:39] Stephen has joined the channel
[02:39] isaacs: i see
[02:39] isaacs: looks like dirname is actually not so bad.
[02:39] isaacs: since you've made that windows-friendly.
[02:39] piscisaureus: yeha
[02:39] isaacs: what happens when you dirname("C:")?
[02:39] isaacs: just returns .?
[02:39] Ratty_: python has os.sep which is the path separator, maybe you need to implement that
[02:40] piscisaureus: isaacs: you get 'c:'
[02:40] isaacs: Ratty_: piscisaureus has implemented things to do the same job.
[02:40] piscisaureus: c: is a relative path
[02:40] isaacs: piscisaureus: oh, right
[02:40] isaacs: piscisaureus: what about C:\
[02:40] isaacs: what's the dirname of that?
[02:40] piscisaureus: heh. also c:. wrong
[02:40] isaacs: ok...
[02:40] piscisaureus: what do you think it should be
[02:41] isaacs: i dunno.
[02:41] piscisaureus: because it should be fixed

[02:43] comster has joined the channel
[02:43] isaacs: so, some way to split the path up into parts would be great.
[02:44] isaacs: i guess, i could just on windows do p.split(/[\/\\]/) and on others do p.split(/\//)
[02:44] isaacs: then take the first as given (which will be '' on unix, and C: on windows)
[02:44] isaacs: assuming that it's an abs path to begin with, that should be fine.

[02:46] isaacs: no, not really
[02:47] piscisaureus: I'm okay but it should have sensible semantics
[02:47] isaacs: just a sorta ad-hoc version.
[02:47] isaacs: that only works for guaranteed absoltue paths
[02:47] isaacs: if it's something that lives on require('path') then it has to be a lot more solid, and that's hard to do right (as we saw)

[02:53] matyr has joined the channel
[02:55] maushu: sholmes, depends on what you have on the second argument for listen.
[02:56] maushu: Depending on what hostname you have there the connections will come for it.
[02:56] maushu: localhost or 127.0.0.1 would make the server blind to the outside
[02:57] maushu: Omitting the argument will make it work with any hostname.

[03:03] creationix: err, nevermind, you saw that
[03:03] creationix: but it should be documented
[03:03] ryah: piscisaureus: huh?

[03:04] piscisaureus: I heard a rumour that crypto was going away so maybe it's best not to rely on it
[03:04] NuckingFuts: ryah: Can the crypto module be used to encyprt strings via public-private key encryption?
[03:05] NuckingFuts: And is what piscisaureus says true?
[03:05] vipaca_: Is there a tool do something like var ArrayList = require('java.util.ArrayList');

[03:13] NuckingFuts: Ratty_ lol
[03:13] Lorentz: Wait until a new release for Ni comes out

[03:14] sholmes: Lorentz, why?
[03:15] perlmonkey2: NuckingFuts: you need openssl. Their site has great docs on how PK encryption works and how to use the tool.
[03:15] Lorentz: sholmes: Try to camel case ecky ecky ecky ptang ptang zoo bowing zow sing
[03:15] sholmes: wtf O.o
[03:16] sholmes: Am I suppose to understand that?

[03:16] Lorentz: No, but the knights would.
[03:16] NuckingFuts: perlmonkey2: Are the Node functions just wrappers around OpenSSL?
[03:17] sholmes: Fhat wucking nights?
[03:17] sholmes: s/nights/knights
[03:17] perlmonkey2: NuckingFuts: I would assume Crypt uses the openssl api, since it requires openssl for the crypt module to work.
[03:17] sholmes: what knights?
[03:17] chris6F: monty python
[03:19] sholmes: I only seen one thing on monty python, and that was the SPAM episode.
[03:19] sholmes: So, sorry, I don't know what you mean Lorentz. :\
[03:19] sholmes: But as far as Ni goes, why shouldn't I use it?
[03:19] sholmes: Is it because there's not enough development going into it anymore?
[03:20] sholmes: Is it not as powerful as something like express?
[03:20] NuckingFuts: Not quit what I'd meant, perlmonkey2, but I'll look anyways XD
[03:21] Lorentz: sholmes: Personally not used ni myself, so can't say. I mainly use express.
[03:21] Lorentz: Can't be that different, can it?
[03:23] sholmes: well with Ni routes are automatically handled for you where a path such as '/hello/world/1/2/3' get's routed to the world() function exported by /controllers/hello
[03:23] Me1000 has joined the channel
[03:23] sholmes: and the 1 and 2 arguments are accessable within that world() function using path.split('/')
[03:24] sholmes: err, no.
[03:24] sholmes: the 1 and 2 can be parameters for world()
[03:25] sholmes: yeah, so it kinda makes things easier. If you want to create a new function don't have to do app.get('/newfunction', require('controllers/newfunction.js')) everytime you want to add a new directory.
[03:25] sholmes: idk, I'm just not feeling it with express for some reason.
[03:26] creationix: sholmes: if you want something minimal try stack
[03:26] sholmes: I can't follow the guide. Maybe that's because I'm new to most of this stuff (PHP guy here).
[03:26] creationix: then you can build your own system
[03:27] sholmes: I want something that will be able to make it easy for me to separate my application in an MVC pattern. That is, I want my controllers to controll the input from requests, views to be templated html, and models to be objects that access MySQL
[03:28] sholmes: Maybe express can do this for me?
[03:28] creationix: sholmes: then why use node?
[03:28] creationix: just curious, not saying you shouldn't
[03:28] sholmes: creationix, because it's JavaScript!
[03:28] creationix: rails already does that very well
[03:28] sholmes: :D
[03:28] creationix: look for the mvc example in express
[03:28] sholmes: I don't know ruby. Not particularly interested in learning it either.
[03:28] creationix: I think it's in the examples folder
[03:28] warz has joined the channel
[03:28] sholmes: also, Node is asynchronous by default
[03:29] creationix: yes, which makes is hard for most people, but awesome to those who know what it means
[03:29] sholmes: Wouldn't a front-end developer like myself know what it means?
[03:30] creationix: well, there isn't actually that much async in a browser
[03:30] dominic_ has joined the channel
[03:30] sholmes: sure, there's the event loop
[03:30] creationix: right, it's evented all the way
[03:30] creationix: but most things you do are sync
[03:30] creationix: they are in-memory operations
[03:31] sholmes: like alert and stuff I guess?
[03:31] creationix: well, setting innerHTML is sync
[03:31] creationix: writing to a file in node isn't
[03:31] sholmes: ah
[03:31] dominic_ has joined the channel
[03:31] creationix: ajax and user interaction is evented
[03:31] creationix: but that tends to be pretty shallow in complexity
[03:31] sholmes: well, it's not too hard to understand if you've done addEventListener in the DOM
[03:32] creationix: agreed, that's one of the reasons node uses javascript
[03:32] astoon has joined the channel
[03:32] creationix: the culture is a good fit for node's goals
[03:33] sholmes: yeah, also, sense pretty much the primary/only langauge on the front-end is much JavaScript, it makes a perfect fit as being *the* server-side solution to web applications
[03:33] creationix: sholmes: seriously, if, for some reason the existing frameworks don't work for you, try a meta framework like stack to build your own framework
[03:33] creationix: it's lots of fun and not that hard
[03:33] creationix: sholmes: yep
[03:34] sholmes: hmm, link to stack?
[03:34] creationix: https://github.com/creationix/stack
[03:34] creationix: also before stack, tj and I made connect (the engine behind express)
[03:34] sholmes: haha, you salesman. xP
[03:34] creationix: hey, I saw a need, wrote the software, and now I share it
[03:34] creationix: nothing wrong with that

[03:39] creationix: and I think it puts them in req.params.one and req.params.two
[03:39] creationix: variables

[03:40] creationix: I think it also supports javascript regular expressions instead of parsed strings
[03:41] creationix: that's how I did it back in node-router
[03:41] sholmes: also, what if you want to do a sub path:   /sum/1/2/3/5/8/etc...
[03:41] sholmes: where it returns the sum of all the variable number of arguments
[03:41] emacsen_: creationix, now if only someone would write an org-mode parser in js....
[03:41] braddunbar: i'm having some trouble with my no.de machine, anyone have experience with that?  (already tried #joyent - no one there)
[03:42] braddunbar: creationix: haven't tried wheat yet - love step though, wonderful piece of code
[03:42] creationix: sholmes: instead of trying to find a framework to do the work for you, it's often easier to just implement it as a custom module
[03:42] creationix: braddunbar: thanks, you should try stack
[03:42] creationix: it's step for http servers
[03:42] davidthings has joined the channel

[03:50] sholmes: creationix, about multiple path sub directories; how would you match a route with variable number of subdirectories: /path/1/2/3/etc?
[03:51] creationix: sholmes: I can make a gist if you want
[03:51] sholmes: sure
[03:51] creationix: though, express does it with blobs
[03:51] creationix: and then you just get a string with slashes in in it
[03:51] sholmes: blobs?
[03:52] creationix: *
[03:52] creationix: I think

[03:53] sholmes: would it be params.splat?
[03:53] creationix: I think so
[03:53] sholmes: let me test it out/play with it.
[03:53] creationix: initially Express was a port of Sinatra to node
[03:54] sholmes: Never heard of Sinatra before Express. But yeah, I guess I have to get familiar with Sinatra if I want to get used to Express.
[03:54] blowery_off has joined the channel
[03:54] creationix: I still think writing your own framework is best, but I'm probably crazy like that
[03:54] creationix: and we have plenty of frameworks
[03:56] sholmes: yeah, I was initially going to write NodeIgniter, but I found out about Ni, which is exactly that.
[03:56] creationix: nice, I haven't heard of Ni
[03:56] sholmes: CodeIgniter is a PHP framework, so I was planning on porting it. But then Ni is already a port, so I figured I could just use that. But one of the reasons why I'm hassitent to just using Ni, is because I don't know about the development on it.
[03:56] creationix: I used CodeIgniter back in the day
[03:56] creationix: it's the PHP equivalent to Sinatra I think
[03:57] braddunbar: so, my no.de smartmachine is complaining that it "Cannot find module 'express'" although express is installed and can be required from the repl
[03:57] sholmes: Yeah, I've never used CodeIgniter. Haha. I just saw some of the tutorials on the codeigniter site, and I was impressed with the simple MVC patterned it created.

[03:58] sholmes: well, the thing with CI is that you follow the path/routing pattern, '/controller/function/arg/arg/.,,'
[03:58] creationix: sholmes: I can whip up a stack module to do that routing real easy if you want
[03:59] sholmes: This is cool, but I wonder if there's more that you can get out of Express'/Sinatra's route strings.
[03:59] sholmes: creationix, I already did that myself too, haha.
[03:59] creationix: so make a route "/:controller/:function/*" and then in the handler delegate to the right controller's function and .apply with the splat split on "/"
[04:00] sholmes: It's really easy, yes. It only took  me a few hours one night. But then I didn't do too much more to it, because Ni already has everything there.
[04:00] sholmes: hmm.
[04:00] creationix: the think about stack, and connect/express is modules can be shared
[04:00] sholmes: shared?
[04:00] creationix: so I can use connect's gzip module in my stack program if I want
[04:01] creationix: or my streaming static file server module can be used in express/connect
[04:01] creationix: reusable middleware modules
[04:01] creationix: does Ni use the same format, or is it custom?

[04:11] mikeal: if you're up for it
[04:11] mikeal: i'm done with meetings around 5
[04:12] Aikar: how come fs.readFile('~/.bashrc',   doesn't work... ?
[04:12] Aikar: cant use tilda?
[04:12] NodeTwister: Is there a way to call a function and have that function print something out to the browser without having to pass the response variable to the function?
[04:12] creationix: mikeal: I'm going to the developer event after that too
[04:12] NodeTwister: This is really bugging me
[04:12] creationix: not sure when it gets out
[04:12] sholmes: so the best Sinatra style routing can do is splat strings?
[04:12] sholmes: req.params.splat is undefined when I try access /hi with the route /*
[04:13] amerine_ has joined the channel
[04:13] NodeTwister: Is response.write() the *only* way to send stuff to the browser?
[04:13] yhahn: Aikar: you need to use path.resolve (0.3) i don't believe you can use ~ in (0.2)
[04:13] mikeal: wait
[04:13] sholmes: in fact, there's no mention of splat in req when I inspect it
[04:13] mikeal: there is another event after that event?
[04:14] techwraith has joined the channel
[04:14] sholmes: NodeTwister, that and response.end('stuff') AFAIK
[04:14] NodeTwister: Damn
[04:14] polotek: NodeTwister: not sure what you're getting at
[04:14] sholmes: Why, what's wrong with that?
[04:14] polotek: what problem are you trying to solve
[04:14] NodeTwister: I'm tired of passing response to a function just so I can print form it
[04:14] NodeTwister: *print from inside the function
[04:15] sholmes: by print you mean res.write?
[04:15] NodeTwister: yes
[04:15] sholmes: hmm, what if you were to res.write(myFunction()); then just return what you want from myFunction?
[04:15] polotek: NodeTwister: you want an automatic output type of thing like PHP? No deal ;)
[04:16] sholmes: polotek, what are you proposing?
[04:16] NodeTwister: Can I make response a global?
[04:17] polotek: nothing. just being facetious. I'm still not sure why what NodeTwister is frustrated
[04:17] paulrobinson has joined the channel
[04:17] polotek: NodeTwister: no
[04:17] sholmes: NodeTwister, maybe you want a templating engine of somekind?
[04:17] polotek: there is one res object per request
[04:17] polotek: and it incapsulates the connection for that request
[04:17] paulrobinson has left the channel
[04:18] sholmes: polotek, do you use express?
[04:18] polotek: if you're building up a non-trivial response, you should almost certainly be using a templating engine
[04:19] NodeTwister: Such as?
[04:19] ryah: NodeTwister: jade
[04:19] ryah: NodeTwister: http://jade-lang.com/
[04:19] Lorentz: What was that templating engine thing that basically had inline nodejs?
[04:20] Lorentz: Sort of how php does things, embedded into html
[04:20] NodeTwister: js embed?
[04:20] ryah: Lorentz: http://www.jspp.io/
[04:21] Lorentz: ryah: Thanks
[04:21] NodeTwister: And it's the only thing PHP ever got fat
[04:21] NodeTwister: *right
[04:21] Lorentz: I honestly can't read jade template files. If I'm doing web dev, I have to see the html :\
[04:21] ryah: ACTION shakes fucking openssl BIOs violently
[04:22] NodeTwister: Embeded code in HTML is the only good idea from PHP (and it came from JSP)
[04:23] NodeTwister: JSP I have to admit is pretty awesome :)

[04:30] aurynn: is there an npm search?
[04:30] polotek: sholmes: better to compare sinatra to express
[04:30] polotek: node is much lower level than that
[04:30] Lorentz: aurynn: npm list | grep ?
[04:30] sholmes: NodeTwister, so official fansite is basically her official site or is it her official "fan site"?
[04:30] Blink7 has joined the channel
[04:30] Lorentz: That's what I do, for now.
[04:30] aurynn: ah
[04:30] polotek: I think express supports regexes
[04:30] polotek: don't know about splats
[04:30] sholmes: polotek, sorry that's what I meant. :P

[04:31] mscdex: SubStack: what do you think about adding in a condition to the while loop in loop() that checks end AND if offset >= buffer.length ?
[04:31] polotek: or "npm ls foo" on the command line
[04:31] NodeTwister: As in, endorsed by Madonna's company.
[04:31] NodeTwister: (And property of)
[04:31] polotek: Lorentz: you don't have to grep
[04:32] polotek: npm list takes keywords to search on
[04:32] Lorentz: polotek: It's a habit.
[04:32] sholmes: NodeTwister, they're paying you right?
[04:32] polotek: ACTION was asking that question to himself
[04:32] NodeTwister: sholmes: Of course.
[04:32] pquerna: but but but, i want multiple headers
[04:33] NodeTwister: ACTION is making $600 a day
[04:33] sholmes: NodeTwister, are you single handingly doing it, or are you working with a team?
[04:33] mscdex: SubStack: i've got a binary file that only has key:length:data blocks, so i need to keep looping while there is still blocks to be retrieved, but i won't know when i've reached the end of the buffer
[04:33] NodeTwister: And spending it all on the Manhattan amenities
[04:33] sholmes: NodeTwister: lucky
[04:33] polotek: NodeTwister: how did you get them to agree to use node?
[04:33] NodeTwister: sholmes: I have people under me to help
[04:33] sholmes: I made $500, in two weeks. :\
[04:34] Lorentz: Never had a client asking to work in node yet :(
[04:34] NodeTwister: polotek: They had problems in the past scaling a site that was LAMP
[04:34] sholmes: Did they ask you to work in Node NodeTwister, or did you propose it?
[04:34] creationix: pquerna: sshhh
[04:34] NodeTwister: Well, you have to really sell node/nginx to them.
[04:34] Lorentz: Sigh, only if I could serve websockets through nginx.
[04:35] NodeTwister: I proposed it sholmes.
[04:35] Aria: write a module for it, Lorentz!
[04:35] sholmes: Yeah, I wouldn't have thought Madonna's crew would have known a lick about Node.
[04:35] Lorentz: Aria: It's something about nginx having support only for http 1.0, rather than 1.1 needed for websockets.
[04:35] NodeTwister: And now Madonna may be the first to have a node.js site
[04:35] ryah: pquerna: is it possible that BIO_read and SSL_read both return WANT_READ
[04:35] ryah: pquerna: :/
[04:35] Lorentz: Rather than an issue with node or socketio or anything.
[04:36] sholmes: Well, there are other sites already using Node.js. But she might be the first "out there" site.
[04:36] NodeTwister: sholmes: They are surprisingly forward-thinking about things like async I/O vs. threadpools
[04:36] ryah: pquerna: also are BIO_ errors handled by SSL_error ? :)
[04:36] sholmes: I think I'm starting to love Madonna now. :P
[04:36] NodeTwister: But to be sure, the focus is more on stuff like CSS
[04:36] polotek: I think it would be cool to get info from a pretty straight up content time
[04:36] polotek: just massive numbers
[04:36] NodeTwister: sholmes: I always have :)
[04:36] polotek: see what node can handle
[04:37] sholmes: NodeTwister what framework are you using?
[04:37] sholmes: Express?
[04:37] NodeTwister: sholmes: Straight node.js with some custom modules
[04:37] Lorentz: Aria: I guess technically it'd be writing a module. Just, for nginx, not nodejs.
[04:38] NodeTwister: Static stuff is of course served via nginx directly
[04:38] sholmes: Oh so it's not 100% node?
[04:38] Aria: Right. I meant for nginx ;-)
[04:38] NodeTwister: sholmes: Stuff like CSS files are served by nginx, so no
[04:39] NodeTwister: Okay, I have to vogue
[04:39] sholmes: NodeTwister, interesting. Is there any reason why you chose to do that an not just some static provider middleware?
[04:39] NodeTwister: sholmes: To use node.js in a big project, really.
[04:40] NodeTwister: And we're doing some interesting things I can't talk about yet :-)
[04:40] ryah: and does SSL_get_error apply to fucking BIO_ functions?
[04:40] ryah: gah
[04:40] sholmes: NodeTwister, that's what I'm going to do. :\
[04:40] saschagehlich has joined the channel
[04:40] NodeTwister: Anyway gtg vogue, bye
[04:40] polotek: sholmes: better to let nginx handle static stuff

[04:40] clarkfischer has joined the channel
[04:40] sholmes: polotek, why?
[04:40] vipaca: any guides for tuning a sever for node deployment i.e. upping file descriptors
[04:40] polotek: let the node process focus on dynamic stuff
[04:40] sholmes: Cannot Node do it all?
[04:40] mscdex: vipaca: ulimit
[04:41] polotek: sholmes: sure it can, but IMO it's not the best use of node resources to just serve static stuff
[04:41] Vekz has joined the channel
[04:41] polotek: plus it's not quite as efficient as something like nginx
[04:41] kiddphunk has joined the channel
[04:41] sholmes: polotek, well serve static stuff, but also do dynamic stuff of course
[04:41] polotek: and you probably want nginx in front of node anyway since it's still pretty raw
[04:42] polotek: give you better consistency on your public facing side
[04:42] sholmes: what do you mean by raw?
[04:42] polotek: as in new and not fully battle tested
[04:42] ryah: pquerna: ah, that's my problem
[04:42] sivy has joined the channel
[04:42] polotek: you want a fallback if node falls over
[04:43] sholmes: polotek, falls over as in the project becomes no more?
[04:43] polotek: you can have nginx server your nice "technical difficulties" pages and such
[04:43] polotek: plus you can have nginx load balance across several nodes
[04:43] matyr has joined the channel
[04:43] polotek: falls over as in you hit some obscure bug or don't handle some exception properly
[04:43] jakehow has joined the channel
[04:44] pquerna: ryah: http://linux.die.net/man/3/bio_should_retry
[04:44] sholmes: but I could run into a bug the same way with dynamic stuff handled in Node
[04:44] polotek: mscdex: someone should write a real blog post about that
[04:44] polotek: I'd like to see more details and proven configurations
[04:44] mscdex: huh?
[04:44] pquerna: SSL BIOs are the only current exception to this rule:....
[04:44] mscdex: oh, ulimit?
[04:44] vipaca: mscdex: Is there a way to specify epoll, kqueue
[04:44] polotek: about configuring a server for production node
[04:44] pquerna: ACTION head explode
[04:45] sholmes: What if you where just servering templates, CSS, and JS files from your Node static provider?
[04:45] mscdex: vipaca: it automatically choses the best method depending on the platform you're on
[04:45] polotek: is anyone else actively ignoring the conversation between ryah and pquerna?
[04:45] polotek: it's making my head hurt
[04:45] sholmes: Then most of the stuff is done throught realtime communication between the client and server.
[04:46] sholmes: ACTION raises hand
[04:49] sholmes: NodeTwister: what language/framework are you using on the nginx side?
[04:49] superjudge has joined the channel
[04:49] polotek: sholmes: nginx doesn't do dynamic scripting
[04:50] polotek: well technically it can, sort of
[04:50] polotek: but it's mostly just a static web serving engine
[04:50] sholmes: well what's the point of a static file server that doesn't do any kind of templating?
[04:50] polotek: if you're doing templating it's not "static"
[04:51] polotek: "dynamic" scripting includes templating
[04:51] Lorentz: apache lets you do perl magic in the configs.
[04:51] ryah: god.
[04:51] polotek: at least in my vocabulary
[04:51] sholmes: so, he's only using it for CSS and JS file serving?
[04:51] ryah: ACTION stabs himself
[04:51] Lorentz: Yes, right in the configs.
[04:51] Aria: BIO is that fun, eh, ryah?
[04:51] ryah: ACTION stabs openssl first then stabs self.
[04:51] Aria: ACTION joins in the openssl stabbery.
[04:51] polotek: ryah: that's right, take them down with you
[04:51] jetienne_: with dox, is it possible to customize the generated html ?
[04:52] sholmes: polotek: well what's the point of having a nginx server if you are more likely to be serving "dynamic" files?
[04:52] pquerna: more minions for selene when i take a sabbatical.
[04:52] polotek: sholmes: with a high traffic content site, it's really important to make serving static files as efficient as possible
[04:52] polotek: nginx is way better for that
[04:52] polotek: it's tailored for it
[04:52] polotek: when you need things to be dynamic, you need a scripting language
[04:52] polotek: so you pass the request to node
[04:53] polotek: neither is "more likely"
[04:53] sholmes: Surely Node couldn't be that bad?
[04:53] polotek: they're both part of the site experience
[04:53] polotek: but you pick the best tool for the job
[04:53] Aria: Or it's important to be able to increase the resources serving bottleneck parts.
[04:53] sholmes: Node could do the static providing if I wanted right, perfectly fine?
[04:53] Aria: Squeezing 10% extra out won't save you jack if your use doubles.
[04:53] Aria: But adding a second server does that nicely.
[04:54] polotek: sholmes: yeah, lots of people run everything from node
[04:54] Lorentz: I also like doing reverse proxy with nginx, since some stuff I serve are done in php and ruby and etc, but still want to pass it through port 80.
[04:54] polotek: but like I said, I don't know anyone doing a traditional high traffic content site with it
[04:54] sholmes: hell, Express/Connect comes with a staticProvider middleware
[04:54] hosh_office: sholmes: you don't have to front with Nginx if you don't want to. What you get out of it are things like load balancing, and multi-homing built in
[04:54] Aria: multi-homing, eh?
[04:54] sholmes: I'm not familiar with load balancing or multi-homing.
[04:55] polotek: Aria: virtual hosts
[04:55] Aria: Oh. That's not multi-homing.
[04:55] hosh_office: sholmes: suppose you want two different node apps running on the same server, and you only have one ip but different web sites
[04:55] sholmes: You see, I'm came from a complete PHP background, hardly even delt with apache aside from .htaccess files.
[04:55] Lorentz: virtual hosts aren't quite multihoming.
[04:55] hosh_office: Aria: multi-homing is the old term. I don't know why I forgot to use "virtual server" these days
[04:55] sholmes: hosh_office, listening
[04:55] Aria: Multi-homing means something else entirely. Like "having two ISPs" else entirely.
[04:56] polotek: I'm not familiar with the term multi-homing either
[04:56] polotek: I kind of assumed from context
[04:56] saikat has left the channel

[04:56] Aria: Like "use two pipes efficiently" differently.
[04:56] sholmes: hosh_office, what you're saying is you can host multiple sites on the same server?
[04:56] hosh_office: Aria: ok sure whatever
[04:56] saikat has joined the channel
[04:56] hosh_office: sholmes: you can put the two apps into the same node process if you want to
[04:56] ryah: oh man.
[04:57] hosh_office: sholmes: or you separate them out and front both with nginx and use nginx to figure out who to proxy too
[04:57] sholmes: why couldn't you juse run two processes?
[04:57] Aria: you could.
[04:57] hosh_office: sholmes: ok sure, if you have two different IP addresses
[04:57] sholmes: hmm, couldn't you use a node process to be a proxy?
[04:57] ryah: [0x20ad3f0] BIO: BIO_read:EncOut want read
[04:57] ryah: yes!
[04:57] Aria: You could. Then you have three processes!
[04:57] hosh_office: sholmes: uh, yeah you can use a third node.js to proxy it :-P
[04:57] killfill has joined the channel
[04:58] hosh_office: There's just tools man

[04:58] hosh_office: polotek: well good for you
[04:58] polotek: one configured for static serving, load balancing and proxying
[04:58] sholmes: hosh_office: I see.
[04:58] polotek: serving to several others
[04:58] sholmes: polotek: me too!
[04:58] sholmes: I mean why not?
[04:58] polotek: a couple application servers
[04:58] hosh_office: Asymmetric fast transients
[04:58] polotek: a background job queue process
[04:58] sholmes: I believe Node came up close to nginx when it came to proformance
[04:58] sholmes: anyway

[04:59] ryah: god.
[04:59] polotek: and each other through message passing
[04:59] ryah: does it want to handshake again?
[04:59] hosh_office: Sure. How does that help you get your app out and working?
[04:59] polotek: ryah: try rebooting it
[04:59] polotek: >_>
[04:59] creationix: sholmes: when you get back, I have an optimized MVC middleware for you
[05:00] polotek: creationix: what's happening with the headers?
[05:00] pquerna: ryah: what do you mean handshake again?
[05:00] hosh_office: polotek: my point is that you can't just look at evented I/O, you have to look at evented people I/O too
[05:01] pquerna: ryah: but either way, you can see if it was in wireshark / ssldump
[05:01] mscdex: SubStack: scratch that, i found out i can just check a vars value for null after trying to read in a value to detect end of file
[05:01] creationix: polotek: I think I'm going to go with a simple patch for now
[05:01] creationix: I just learned node already has some support for multiple headers
[05:01] creationix: https://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/lib/http.js#L454
[05:01] creationix: that changes my objections to pushing a change by tomorrow
[05:02] ryah: pquerna: both reads want to read again
[05:02] polotek: yeah I knew that the parser supported them okay
[05:02] Jaye: polotek: I have built have of that, its pretty easy with node <3, dont own the license/IP due to it being for work though :(, most annoying thing is websockets dont like being redirected
[05:02] rbranson has joined the channel
[05:02] ryah: and the socket isn't providing more data...
[05:02] Jaye: *half
[05:02] polotek: I thought we were saying we didn't want to push this api change unless it also supported multiple headers
[05:02] polotek: more explicitly
[05:02] creationix: polotek: right, but node does more than I thought already
[05:02] chapel: hmm
[05:03] creationix: so I'm fine with a small change now and a better one later
[05:03] pquerna: ryah: yeah. dunno why it would do that, but... all seems possible.
[05:03] polotek: \o/
[05:03] ryah: pquerna: if both SSL_read and BIO_read want read, and chrome isn't sending more data
[05:03] chapel: hmm
[05:03] polotek: I so rarely convince people of things when it comes to node patches
[05:03] ryah: pquerna: what would be your action?
[05:04] ryah: next tick and try again? :P
[05:04] jetienne_: ryah: find somebody who know the lib to give info ?
[05:04] cjm has joined the channel
[05:04] polotek: jetienne_: openssl is dark voodoo magic. probably not coded by humans
[05:05] jetienne_: eb2._global = window || global || console.assert(false); <- is that ok to discover the global name space  ? this is for a js library
[05:05] jetienne_: polotek: the code is old so it ages badly. common in computer stuff
[05:06] polotek: jetienne_: you need to use typeof
[05:06] pquerna: ryah: well, why would chrome not send anymore data? socket closed?
[05:06] polotek: if window isn't defined you'll get an error
[05:06] Guest91152 has joined the channel
[05:06] pquerna: ryah: i guess i'd look at wireshark / the ssl proto going over the wire if it was a chrome specific thing
[05:07] jetienne_: polotek: ok thx
[05:08] sholmes has joined the channel
[05:08] ceej_: what's better for channel based real time app... socket.io and redis or faye?
[05:09] sholmes: back
[05:09] creationix: sholmes: ok, I'm working through the bugs, but here is the general idea
[05:09] aldonline has joined the channel
[05:09] sholmes: ACTION listening :D
[05:09] polotek: ceej_: I've only used socket.io and it's pretty popular
[05:10] polotek: but I was interested in trying faye for something
[05:10] creationix: sholmes: https://gist.github.com/817917
[05:10] polotek: if you try it, share your experience
[05:10] ceej_: ye I've used both just not sure....
[05:10] cronopio: ceej_: i use faye, and always work great!!
[05:10] cronopio: ceej_: and is easy to use
[05:10] ceej_: I built a real time game...socket.io seemed faster but it's only going to be used for a b2b app
[05:11] sholmes: creationix: and this just does what Ni does?
[05:11] creationix: no idea what Ni does
[05:11] creationix: but this maps /math/add/1/2 to math.add(req, res, next, 1, 2)
[05:11] sholmes: it does what CodeIgniter does, if you can remember how that worked.
[05:12] jetienne_: polotek: eb2._global	= typeof window2 !== "undefined" ? window2 : typeof global !== "undefined" ? global : console.assert(false); <- less clean :(
[05:12] sholmes: creationix: that's an interesting concept
[05:12] creationix: I know the general pattern, but any request handler in node needs req and res (and next if it's middleware)
[05:13] creationix: and the "controllers" and be in their own files that are lazy loaded
[05:13] m0 has joined the channel
[05:13] edw has joined the channel
[05:13] polotek: jetienne_: this is a hack to try and merge browser and server environments anyway
[05:13] polotek: I wouldn't worry too much about how clean it is
[05:13] m0: Hello everyone, I am wondering, who is running a node 25/7?
[05:13] sholmes: creationix, well, at least with the NodeIginiter I was making, I just applied an object to the controller function so that this.res and this.req within the function will be the objects
[05:13] m0: 24*
[05:13] polotek: that looks okay to me by the way
[05:13] jetienne_: polotek: ok
[05:13] polotek: but there is another wrinkle. at least in node
[05:14] sholmes: come to think about it, that might be an interesting way to implement connect/stack
[05:14] polotek: node also has the capability to run each module in it's own separate context
[05:14] m0: I am trying to run a node on my dedicated box, and it errors out http://pastebin.com/HERrwuE7 (I have no idea when it errors out) I check back the other day
[05:14] polotek: in which case each module has it's own separate global object
[05:14] hosh_work has joined the channel
[05:14] polotek: I've never played with this and I don't think it's a commonly used feature
[05:14] polotek: but you should probably be aware
[05:14] matyr_ has joined the channel
[05:15] sholmes: polotek, that's awesome!
[05:15] sholmes: I was proposing an imports object for modules, but this definately will do. How does it work?
[05:15] polotek: m0
[05:15] polotek: m0: you need to catch errors
[05:16] jetienne_: polotek: yes i use brequire to support require() in browser
[05:16] m0: polotek: catch where? I have no idea where to catch
[05:16] polotek: with either req.on('error'...)
[05:16] polotek: or process.on('UncaughtException'...)
[05:16] sholmes: creationix: would /math/list/1/2 map to math.lsit(req,res,next,1,2)?
[05:17] creationix: sholmes: ok, bugs ironed out, not it's runnable
[05:17] tvon has joined the channel
[05:17] m0: DO error messages bubble up?/

[05:18] sholmes: polotek, hmm. seems a bit hacky.
[05:18] polotek: m0 all errors bubble up
[05:18] polotek: if it reaches the top of the stack uncaught, node will crash
[05:18] polotek: well it's print and exit
[05:18] tmpvar: goodnight folks, ryah good luck with the ssl stuff
[05:19] creationix: sholmes: ok, I added sample output
[05:19] sholmes: let me upload my script
[05:19] creationix: that should explain it
[05:19] sholmes: how do I upload scripts to github like that haha
[05:19] sholmes: maybe is should just use paste bin.
[05:19] creationix: gist.github.com
[05:19] Solsys has joined the channel
[05:19] creationix: it's like pasebin
[05:20] creationix: but also if a full-fledged git repo
[05:21] sholmes: creationix, is there a way to remove them after I pasted it?
[05:21] sholmes: here it is btw https://gist.github.com/817929
[05:21] creationix: sholmes: you might be able to delete it
[05:21] sholmes: I'm really a neat freak! xP
[05:21] matyr has joined the channel
[05:22] creationix: sholmes: that works, but there is some sync io in there
[05:23] creationix: so "index" is the default controller name?
[05:23] creationix: and "index" is also the default method name
[05:23] sholmes: yes
[05:23] sholmes: it is
[05:23] sholmes: they are
[05:23] creationix: ok, yeah, this can be made into a nice middleware
[05:24] creationix: sholmes: how much longer will you be up tonight?
[05:24] creationix: I need to get something else done before my friends on the east coast conk out

[05:26] sholmes: existsSync, hmm.
[05:26] polotek: it's just forwarding it to another event emitter
[05:26] polotek: you'll have to catch it on that one too
[05:27] creationix: path.exists is quite nasty actually
[05:27] polotek: ryah: oh, sorry :/
[05:27] creationix: better to fs.readdir the controller directory on startup and just require all the controllers once
[05:27] creationix: then you can use the super fast .hasOwnProperty check on your controller container
[05:27] orospakr has joined the channel
[05:27] m0: polotek: is there a quick way to initiate an error to test :)
[05:28] polotek: how do you mean?
[05:28] sholmes: creationix, but if I use fs.readdir then they wont be modules
[05:28] polotek: like throw errors to test your handling code?
[05:28] sholmes: oh wait
[05:28] sholmes: nvm
[05:29] polotek: sure,  throw new Error('this is on purpose :)');
[05:29] m0: polotek: why would catching errors help my problem?
[05:29] m0: polotek: It says Error: ETIMEDOUT, Connection timed out,
[05:30] polotek: m0: that's a timeout error
[05:30] polotek: are you catching on('timeout') ?
[05:30] m0: Even if I can catch those errors, how will that help me handle them?
[05:30] retsam has joined the channel
[05:32] polotek: m0: by catching them they won't stop the server and cause node to bottom out
[05:32] polotek: you give it a callback, inspect the error
[05:32] polotek: log it
[05:32] polotek: do any necessary clean up
[05:32] polotek: then move on

[05:32] dominic__ has joined the channel
[05:32] m0: polotek: it is being caught and then emitting it.
[05:32] saschagehlich_ has joined the channel
[05:33] m0: So I don't  understand why it would crash. Emitting isn't throwing
[05:33] polotek: re-emitting a timeout doesn't make sense
[05:33] dgathright has joined the channel
[05:34] polotek: I don't know exactly what's going on just based on your error message
[05:34] polotek: you've got a lot of non-trivial code here
[05:34] polotek: but re-emitting doesn't actually handle anything
[05:34] polotek: it's also possible that you're not actually handling all errors
[05:34] polotek: I'm not inspecting this code in depth
[05:35] polotek: but your event handlers are inside if statements and such
[05:35] m0: polotek: I am using https://github.com/miksago/node-websocket-server maybe it was a bad idea.
[05:35] polotek: maybe the error is happening in some other code branch
[05:35] kiddphunk has joined the channel
[05:35] polotek: I'm not sure what state it's in right now. it was pretty stable last time I checked

[05:35] polotek: are you using 0.2 or 0.3?

[05:37] polotek: yeah it's been pretty stable for a while. and node-websocket-server works well on that version
[05:37] polotek: not sure
[05:37] polotek: you'd really have to try to reproduce the error and dig into it
[05:37] m0: It happens when I keep the server online for a day or so
[05:38] polotek: m0: oh I've got an idea
[05:38] robotarmy has joined the channel
[05:38] polotek: one problem with node currently is that it's tough to get info from errors of async operations
[05:38] polotek: because you lose most of the useful stack trace
[05:38] m0: Yea correct
[05:38] mscdex: maybe you can disable the timeout
[05:38] polotek: but you could try https://github.com/tlrobinson/long-stack-traces
[05:39] mscdex: afaik it's just a connection idle timeout
[05:39] polotek: which basically stitches the stack traces back together
[05:39] polotek: could give you more clues
[05:39] polotek: mscdex: yeah but he's not sure how to find what's causing it
[05:39] polotek: and it's after it runs for a few days

[05:41] creationix: does /foo map to /index/foo or /foo/index?

[05:41] creationix: ok, just checking

[05:48] sholmes: dox?
[05:48] jetienne_: http://visionmedia.github.com/dox/ a jsdoc parser which generate this kind of page
[05:48] jetienne_: backbone.js is using it too i think
[05:49] sholmes: blah
[05:50] sholmes: I'll stick with an HTML templating engine and MySQL
[05:50] sholmes: I've yet to step outside of my confort zone, Node being an exception.
[05:51] jetienne_: sholmes: on your code, you dont use doxygen or such ?
[05:51] sholmes: no
[05:51] sholmes: not sure what it is actually
[05:51] sholmes: I'm just starting out Node. And I'm using Express and I'll find a template engine
[05:51] chapel: JimBastard: ping
[05:52] jetienne_: sholmes: some preformated way to comment inside the source itself. thus being able to generate teh doc
[05:52] JimBastard: yo
[05:52] sholmes: jetienne_: :S
[05:52] jetienne_: https://github.com/visionmedia/dox/blob/master/lib/dox/index.js#L33-37 sholmes this kind of comment
[05:53] sholmes: so dox is a comment to documentation thing?
[05:53] jetienne_: sholmes: you can find this line in the doc page i gave earlier
[05:53] jetienne_: sholmes: yes. doxygen too

[05:53] ceej_: anyone know why i'd get this?  Redis connection to 127.0.0.1:6379 failed - ECONNREFUSED, Connection refused
[05:53] ceej_: https://gist.github.com/817975
[05:54] jetienne_: ceej_: this means redis is not listening at this address
[05:54] statim has joined the channel
[05:54] jetienne_: ceej_: check the address and redis conf
[05:55] ceej_: it's definitiley correct
[05:56] jetienne_: ceej_: check again :)
[05:56] jetienne_: ceej_: do "telnet 127.0.0.1 6379"
[05:56] ceej_: I'm looking at the redis to go config
[05:56] k04n has joined the channel
[05:57] jetienne_: ceej_: if the telnet say connection refused, check again and again. this mean reddis is not listening to this address
[05:57] ceej_: why's it trying to connect there?  It's no where in the code
[05:57] jetienne_: ceej_: dunno i dont use reddis
[05:59] ceej_: using redis-client doesn't work either
[05:59] jashkenas has joined the channel

[06:22] JimBastard: let me review that post for a second?
[06:23] chapel: JimBastard: indexzero around?
[06:23] JimBastard: is it https://gist.github.com/816004 ?
[06:23] JimBastard: chapel: hes up in boston atm, if hes not online i dunno
[06:23] chapel: hmm ok
[06:23] chapel: forever isn't working right
[06:23] JimBastard: how so?
[06:23] chapel: cant get it to background using start
[06:24] chapel: works if I omit start
[06:24] chapel: ie forever script.js
[06:24] chapel: but the moment I add start: forever start script.js
[06:24] chapel: it just doesn't do anything
[06:25] creationix: sholmes: https://github.com/creationix/creationix/blob/master/controllers.js
[06:25] creationix: sholmes: it's a proper connect style middleware now
[06:25] mjr_: pquerna: have you used the latest https server?
[06:25] creationix: JimBastard: yeah, that's the one
[06:26] creationix: I've got one update to add some error checking, but I think the api stays the same
[06:28] creationix: sholmes: https://gist.github.com/818029
[06:28] creationix: sholmes: you don't have to use it, but you're welcome to use the code for ideas
[06:28] sholmes: hmm. what benifits are there to loading all the controllers? It would seem that this takes more load on the server
[06:29] ceej_: got it working :)
[06:29] creationix: sholmes: It could be modified to lazy load them
[06:29] creationix: sholmes: but it's a bit harder, you don't want to call require for every request, it sometimes does a little IO
[06:29] sholmes: lazy load, meaning not load them.
[06:29] sholmes: all*
[06:30] creationix: not load them till the first time it's needed
[06:30] creationix: so syntax error won't crash the server till that page is hit
[06:30] JimBastard: so creationix , where would the tests go? /test/simple/test-http-server-?
[06:30] creationix: JimBastard: wheverer the writeHead tests are
[06:30] sholmes: you mean by loading all at once with fs.readDir you "cache" them so to speak?
[06:31] creationix: sholmes: right, notice that code is outside the request handler
[06:31] creationix: it's only executed once at server startup
[06:31] matyr_ has joined the channel
[06:31] sholmes: clever
[06:31] creationix: but inside the setup function, so you can have several instances of the middleware with different controller folders
[06:31] creationix: so a blog could be mounted at /blog and another app as /foo
[06:32] creationix: they would share the common requires outside the setup function, but nothing inside it
[06:32] sholmes: hmm. when you add controllers though, you'll need to restart the server
[06:32] creationix: correct
[06:32] creationix: but you have to do that for changes in controllers anyway
[06:33] creationix: and that's more often than adding controllers
[06:33] JimBastard: chapel: forever start myscript.js should just work
[06:33] sholmes: or use nodemon or node-dev which will probably automatically restart
[06:33] JimBastard: you should file an issue if it does
[06:33] chapel: I know
[06:33] JimBastard: n't
[06:33] chapel: okay, well I will look into it
[06:33] chapel: I am running 0.4.0-pre atm
[06:33] JimBastard: maybe update
[06:33] JimBastard: id file an issue
[06:33] chapel: forever v0.3.1 with an update to bin/forever to allow -c
[06:34] chapel: I will try and track down the issue when I have time
[06:34] sholmes: creationix: would you recommend using something like nodemon or node-dev for production?
[06:34] creationix: sholmes: I just use upstart
[06:34] creationix: with the respawn directive
[06:34] sholmes: what's upstart
[06:35] creationix: it's build into ubuntu
[06:35] chapel: hmm
[06:35] creationix: for managing servers
[06:35] chapel: sholmes: check out restartr as well
[06:35] sholmes: ah, I see.
[06:35] sholmes: chapel: link?
[06:36] creationix: sholmes: https://gist.github.com/818043
[06:36] sholmes: creationix: when you server process fail/crashes upstart will restart the server for you?
[06:36] JimBastard: creationix: im still not sure where to add those tests, im looking through the whole suite now
[06:36] JimBastard: theres a lot of tests
[06:36] chapel: sholmes: https://github.com/aaronblohowiak/restartr
[06:37] chapel: sholmes: others might be more up to date, but restartr allows you to use coffee
[06:37] creationix: sholmes: with "respawn" it will auto-restart it if the process dies
[06:37] creationix: it's not the best, but good enough for my use and very easy
[06:37] sholmes: coffeescript?
[06:38] sholmes: are there many Node.js developers out there to hire? haha
[06:38] chapel: to hire?
[06:38] chapel: plenty
[06:39] clarkfischer: Is anyone out there looking to hire node.js developers?
[06:39] clarkfischer: (few)
[06:39] mape: An entire team?
[06:39] chapel: The N Team!
[06:40] chapel: <ryah> I love it when a plan comes together
[06:40] clarkfischer: node is not yet seen as being production-ready, I don't think
[06:40] JimBastard: ive been looking for node ninjas for a while, but ninjas are hard to spot
[06:40] clarkfischer: Most people wouldn't rely on it.
[06:41] JimBastard: our stack is 100% node
[06:41] JimBastard: aside from the database
[06:41] JimBastard: and linux
[06:41] chapel: clarkfischer: maybe some companies, but I see more and more people moving to node, maybe exploratory atm, but still a lot of interest
[06:41] creationix: clarkfischer: most, no, but many do
[06:41] creationix: HP is putting lots of trust in it
[06:41] chapel: yeah
[06:41] JimBastard: when node hits 1.0.0 it will be a big deal
[06:41] clarkfischer: well that's good to hear
[06:41] clarkfischer: I can't wait for this stuff to explode
[06:41] chapel: are you going to the thing tomorrow creationix ?
[06:42] creationix: chapel: yep
[06:42] chapel: cool
[06:42] Lorentz: Wonder how long it'll be until it's 1.0.0.
[06:42] creationix: I'd better get some sleep, it starts pretty early
[06:42] chapel: how much node info?
[06:42] chapel: kk, well have fun, cant wait to hear about it
[06:42] creationix: Lorentz: super rough estimate with zero credibility. 1 year
[06:42] chapel: I was thinking that
[06:42] chapel: we are at 0.4
[06:43] creationix: I expect to hear plans and schedules from Joyent soon, they seem to be organizing the release and bug tracking process lately

[07:03] creationix: no clue
[07:03] aurynn: I suspect my paths are messed up, but I don't know how to test that
[07:03] creationix: you can always console.dir(require.paths)

[07:18] chapel: _jud: ask away
[07:20] _jud: hmm, I was going to post the code on pastie, but that didn't work out so well
[07:21] _jud: basically, I have a JS object
[07:21] _jud: and one of the properties takes an async function
[07:21] _jud: so
[07:22] saschagehlich has joined the channel
[07:22] _jud: var account = {user: asyncSelectUserID(function(data){return data})}
[07:23] _jud: but of course, that doesn't work
[07:24] razvandimescu has joined the channel
[07:24] creationix: chapel: I run creationix.com on linode
[07:24] _jud: since there are a few calls like that in this object, I would need to nest 3+ callbacks (+handle errors)
[07:24] creationix: I just compile node using nvm and then use upstart to keep the server running
[07:24] creationix: I use npm to install packages
[07:25] chapel: kk, should I use a 64bit os?
[07:25] creationix: chapel: no, 32 is better
[07:25] chapel: okay
[07:25] chapel: that was my main question
[07:25] creationix: unless your server needs LOTS of ram
[07:25] chapel: nope
[07:25] chapel: 512mb plan
[07:25] chapel: just playing around
[07:25] creationix: last I checked, V8's 32'bit code it still better and it uses less ram due to the pointers being smaller
[07:26] chapel: _jud: depending on how you go about things, you could do
[07:26] creationix: 'night eveyone
[07:27] chapel: asyncSelectUserID( function(data) { account = data; });

[07:29] SamuraiJack has joined the channel
[07:29] _jud: chapel: that is an idea, except there are 3 different async property lookups in the actual object I am working with
[07:29] chapel: okay
[07:30] chapel: do you have more code to gist?
[07:30] chapel: hard to see context
[07:30] _jud: yea
[07:30] _jud: let me put it up on gist
[07:34] jimt has joined the channel
[07:35] _jud: chapel: https://gist.github.com/6d4b56940252779cf03e
[07:38] chapel: if any of those functions are blocking, or take some time, they probably wont be filled by the time xfer is used elsewhere
[07:39] _jud: right, they take a ~80ms, but xfer is used immediately after
[07:39] chapel: account is the only one I dont know about, the other look fine I assume
[07:39] jimt has joined the channel
[07:39] _jud: ah, well xfer.duser and xfer.cuser are both empty when xfer is used
[07:39] chapel: anyways, with async, you need to scope things, it might be better to use call backs to make sure stuff is being handled
[07:39] dgathright has joined the channel
[07:40] chapel: yeah
[07:40] chapel: I assume account is for a db?
[07:40] _jud: correct
[07:40] chapel: well those need to be handled with call backs
[07:40] chapel: similar to what I showed above
[07:41] chapel: there are a lot of ways to handle stuff like that
[07:41] _jud: so build the xfer var, then query db and alter xfer with the callbacks?
[07:41] _jud: to fill in duser and cuser
[07:41] chapel: yeah probably, and then you would call whatever function you needed to use xfer in inside the call backs of those
[07:41] _jud: yea
[07:42] _jud: I was just hoping there was some pattern I was missing to get that to work as is
[07:42] _jud: haha, I hate getting so nested
[07:43] chapel: well there are cleaner ways to handle it
[07:43] chapel: but they require a little more architecting
[07:43] chapel: you could use a code library like seq/step
[07:43] _jud: something a bit like seq?
[07:43] chapel: but I recommend learning how to handle it yourself
[07:44] chapel: remember that you can send functions around
[07:44] silence has joined the channel
[07:44] _jud: you mean, instead of using anonymous callbacks
[07:45] chapel: yeah
[07:45] chapel: you could make a function that takes xfer and a callback function
[07:45] chapel: and it could handle the db stuff
[07:45] chapel: at that point, you are basically just making it organized better
[07:46] chapel: instead of nesting it
[07:46] _jud: right
[07:46] _jud: I may look into rewriting my little orm to better handle this case
[07:46] _jud: thanks for the help chapel

[16:56] Sebmaster: but you did install your module right?
[16:56] caolanm: ceej: are you running it on 127.0.0.1? because you might want to try 0.0.0.0

[19:14] hunterloftis: Question: demo server, ideally behind nginx (or something) so you can run demo1-demo10 on different :ports without a separate machine for each little test
[19:14] TheTruthIsHard: An inconvenient truth: Asynchronous code is harder to maintain than synchronous code.
[19:14] hunterloftis: Problem: some demos use websockets, which arent supported by nginx. Ideas?
[19:14] Me1000 has joined the channel
[19:15] TheTruthIsHard: Damn it, node.js sucks
[19:15] TheTruthIsHard: Why can't I have a multidimensional array?
[19:16] mscdex: hunterloftis: put the websocket tests on ports controlled directly by node?
[19:16] hunterloftis: mscdex: So have demo1.server.com:90 for webscoket demo 1?
[19:16] mscdex: v8: [['foo'], ['bar']]
[19:16] v8bot: mscdex: [["foo"], ["bar"]]
[19:16] mscdex: looks multidimensional to me
[19:16] mscdex: :)
[19:16] hunterloftis: mscdex: Considering that, makes it iffy to be used behind certain times of firewalls, etc
[19:17] TheTruthIsHard: How do you declare a multidimensional array?
[19:17] liar has joined the channel
[19:17] jesusabdullah: This is javaSCRIPT, not java!
[19:17] mscdex: hunterloftis: how is it any different than setting up a port for nginx?
[19:17] TheTruthIsHard: var a[200]b[100] -- what I want
[19:17] jesusabdullah: You just make it!
[19:17] jesusabdullah: You mean
[19:17] aurynn: TheTruthIsHard, just.. make it..
[19:18] jesusabdullah: a[200][100]
[19:18] mscdex: TheTruthIsHard: you don't declare it, you just create and assign it however you want
[19:18] jesusabdullah: ACTION had better get to work
[19:18] TheTruthIsHard: Are arrays heap or stack then?
[19:18] hunterloftis: mscdex: It's different because lots of proxies at businesses won't let their users visit blah.com:3000
[19:18] jonaslund: most things in JS is on the heap
[19:18] TheTruthIsHard: ok
[19:18] hunterloftis: mscdex: but might be the best solution for these simple demos
[19:19] jonaslund: TheTruthIsHard: if you use closures then even function "local" variables gets onto the heap
[19:19] jonaslund: since you have closures
[19:19] mscdex: hunterloftis: i thought you were already doing blah.com:90, blah.com:91, etc for nginx?
[19:20] hunterloftis: mscdex: blah.com:90, when behind nginx, can become demo1.blah.com:80
[19:20] hunterloftis: and then blah.com:91 can become demo2.blah.com:80

[19:27] Aikar: only objects
[19:27] ukev has joined the channel
[19:27] TheTruthIsHard: So I can reference the array with: madonna[98]['likeaprayer']
[19:27] TheTruthIsHard: Is there a substitute?
[19:27] Aikar: make madonna an array of objects
[19:27] TheTruthIsHard: How do you declare that Aikar?
[19:28] Aikar: madonna = [{foo:'1'}, {foo: '2'}]
[19:28] Aikar: madonna[1].foo
[19:28] Aikar: or madonna[1]['foo']
[19:28] Aikar: {} in js is an object, [ ] is an array

[19:33] Aikar: w/o learning, its going to take you a while anyways
[19:33] TheTruthIsHard: Seriously, I am learning
[19:33] Aikar: trying to do the job w/o learning basics is basically getting other people to do your work for you and you get paid for it
[19:33] TheTruthIsHard: JIT learning ;p
[19:33] Aikar: wheres my 30$ for teaching you how to do arrays of objects :P
[19:34] TheTruthIsHard: Aikar: Paid in full in gratitude. :)

[19:36] clarkfischer: since most of the apis are async

[19:39] jonaslund: around 80$ is my absolute minium rate when contracting
[19:39] TheTruthIsHard: clarkfischer: I use hired carsw.
[19:39] jonaslund: but that is only for short term jobs or for doing really fun stuff
[19:39] TheTruthIsHard: *hired cars

[19:39] Aikar: i dont bother with contract work anymore, too busy, full time job in which i also get to use node at, and i got my own personal projects i do when im at home
[19:39] piscisaureus: Aikar: who :-)
[19:39] mjr_: There are lots of programmers who make more than $90/hr to work on all kinds of software, even PHP stuff, if you can believe it.
[19:39] TheTruthIsHard: Subways are for bluecollar workers
[19:40] Aikar: piscisaureus: that guys employer lol
[19:40] clarkfischer: Subways are awesome.
[19:40] Aikar: it really depends on area too

[19:41] jonaslund: on the other hand living costs in Stockholm are fairly high compared internationally and there's a huge lack of developers

[19:48] swistak: might need good font to see it though
[19:48] jonaslund: piscisaureus: not really sure yet.. a "initial" problem is that eio.c includes eio.h at the top

[19:50] piscisaureus: just include windows.h first then :-)

[20:00] TheTruthIsHard: What does node.js do for WebOS?
[20:00] jesusabdullah: I think the node feature is cool enough that I'd seriously consider getting one over an android right now, despite having never seen a palm phone
[20:00] TheTruthIsHard: WebOS apps are node? :p
[20:00] jesusabdullah: TheTruthIsHard: My understanding is that you program your apps in javascript.
[20:00] jesusabdullah: on node
[20:01] colinclark has joined the channel
[20:01] mjr_: webos uses node internally for external service integration 
[20:01] bartt has joined the channel
[20:01] jonaslund: hmm
[20:01] mjr_: creationix is working on it, but he isn't here right now
[20:01] SubStack: TheTruthIsHard: ask creationix, who works at hp doing node stuffs
[20:01] jonaslund: how do i "revert" a file with git ?
[20:01] SubStack: hah yep
[20:01] mjr_: He tweeted that there might be a webos-related announcement today.
[20:01] squeek: isaacs: on second thoughts could it be that /usr/local/lib/node/ isn't in node's default require path?
[20:02] TheTruthIsHard: So will webOS kill Android?
[20:02] isaacs: squeek: could be
[20:02] jesusabdullah: Hmm. webOS tablet, it seems?
[20:02] jesusabdullah: TheTruthIsHard: Unlikely, I'd think. But who knows?
[20:02] jonaslund: haha
[20:02] TheTruthIsHard: After all,  both are webkit and Linux
[20:02] isaacs: squeek: what platform?  what version of node?  how did you install node and npm originally?
[20:02] jonaslund: webOS kill android :)
[20:02] jesusabdullah: I saw on the supabowl commercials that Motorola has a droid tablet out now
[20:02] jonaslund: does anyone use webos ?
[20:03] jesusabdullah: Well, HP
[20:03] mscdex: i'd never buy motorola
[20:03] jesusabdullah: Why come, mscdex?
[20:03] mscdex: such a bad track record with rom updates
[20:03] TheTruthIsHard: Nokia is the best

[20:03] TheTruthIsHard: Nokia is about to destroy both Apple and Android

[20:03] SubStack: lulnokia
[20:03] SubStack: not even erlang can save them now!
[20:04] mscdex: nokia has bet the farm on meego
[20:04] jonaslund: SubStack: erlang is from ericsson
[20:04] mscdex: they don't have anything else
[20:04] SubStack: pfft, same thing
[20:04] jonaslund: mscdex: no they haven't .. and that is the problem
[20:04] stride: TheTruthIsHard: uh, how?
[20:04] jesusabdullah: I bet Nokia will keep a pretty solid stronghold in their own country, at worst
[20:04] TheTruthIsHard: Nokia is going to make tablets
[20:04] mscdex: jonaslund: they have but they're not doing enough with it

[20:05] jonaslund: SubStack: ericsson itself is mostly about systems nowadays, leaving all consumer stuff to sonyericsson
[20:05] jonaslund: the playstation mobile is an android phone i think
[20:05] mscdex: yep
[20:05] mscdex: xperia play
[20:06] jonaslund: i really can't fathom why they do a playstation mobile and then also "playstation portable 2"
[20:06] jonaslund: make 2 sucky things instead of one good thing
[20:06] jesusabdullah: That's Sony for you
[20:06] jesusabdullah: Maybe they just stole the plans from Ben Heck
[20:06] jesusabdullah: :D
[20:07] jonaslund: jesusabdullah: well apperantly the PS phone is a x10 mini pro with the keyboard exchanged for a gamepad
[20:07] jonaslund: the x10 is a huge hit in sweden
[20:07] TheTruthIsHard: I love using anonymous functions for callbacks. It's the best thing in Javascript!

[20:08] TheTruthIsHard: Microsoft and Nokia will partner to destroy everyone
[20:08] jonaslund: ACTION suspects the playstation phone will outsell playstation portable 2 by a huge factor
[20:08] TheTruthIsHard: Whayt goes wrong with multiple nested callbacks, as long as everything happens in the right order?
[20:08] jonaslund: Nokia needs to kill a few darlings
[20:08] jonaslund: they have far too many
[20:09] jesusabdullah: Well, nothing really GOES wrong, but it ends up being a lot of indentation
[20:09] jonaslund: the problem is that when they cut stuff people are gonna hate them
[20:09] jesusabdullah: Offer to sell?
[20:09] TheTruthIsHard: jesusabdullah: That's why I have two screens ;p
[20:09] jesusabdullah: :D
[20:09] clarkfischer: If you name the multiple nested callbacks it can be quite pretty
[20:09] ehynds: is it a bad idea to set exports = {} rather than define each method individually?

[20:10] Aikar: ehynds: no but you need to do module.exports = {}
[20:10] Aikar: not exports = {}
[20:10] Aikar: as exports will then be decoupled from module
[20:11] mjr_: I can't get it to verify my server cert, but Safari is just fine with it.  And iOS works fine with stunnel.
[20:11] Aikar: ehynds: i do most my exports like module.exports = {}; its fine
[20:11] ehynds: Aikar, thanks
[20:11] jesusabdullah: What's really great is when people think that the right solution to fixing the > problem is to add coroutines ;)
[20:11] lukegalea: Hey everyone.. I asked earlier when everyone was asleep: but has anyone toyed with ajaxim ?? Anything positive/negative to say before we go down that road?

[20:11] jesusabdullah: I'm also curious
[20:11] jesusabdullah: Instant messaging framework, according to ddg
[20:12] lukegalea: http://ajaxim.com/
[20:12] lukegalea: yep, they have a node implementation of the server side
[20:12] Aikar: so you want to replace it with a node system
[20:12] lukegalea: based on express + connect
[20:12] isaacs: squeek: ok, that's why it didn't work.  when you installed npm, it was back when Homebrew node would confuse npm.

[20:12] squeek: isaacs: yeah I hosed my node install, putting in 0.2.6

[20:13] isaacs: squeek: ok, cool
[20:13] lukegalea: We are currently using http-bind + ejabberd. Not working that great. I would love to hear from a noder that had used ajaxim.
[20:13] isaacs: squeek: on the plus side, `brew rm node` should take npm with it
[20:13] jonaslund: piscisaureus: deps/libeio/xthread.h line 21 ... recognize it? :P
[20:13] squeek: isaacs: it didn't, I had to go in there and fish it out, sadly.
[20:13] isaacs: ew
[20:13] piscisaureus: jonaslund: noh
[20:13] piscisaureus: it's trouble with your include path I guess
[20:14] jonaslund: there's a missing semicolon there
[20:14] jesusabdullah: lukegalea: I haven't used it, obviously, but it sounds like it's built on fairly solid technologies and it hasn't broken my computer yet. If it looks like what the doctor ordered to you, what would you lose by trying it out?
[20:14] jonaslund: so i was getting weird-ass errors all over the place that i though were releated to that eio.h thingy
[20:14] isaacs: squeek: npm (current) should work fine with a homebrew installed node, but you'll probably want to manually add /usr/local/lib/node to your NODE_PATH
[20:15] jesusabdullah: Every time I see "eio.h" I think, "eieio.h"
[20:15] piscisaureus: jonaslund: maybe gcc is a little more forgiving than msvc
[20:15] jonaslund: piscisaureus: It's #idef _WIN32 .... #ifndef ..mingw
[20:15] lukegalea: jesusabdullah: ya, that's the next step. It's just when you have a fully working implementation it's easy to feel that the grass is greener over there. But the big difference between the node solution and the erlang one is that I've been able to understand all the node code given a few mins to review... whereas there's a **TON** of technology required to do the equivelent in ejabberd.
[20:16] lukegalea: I'll report back :)
[20:16] piscisaureus: jonaslund: har har. and you manually defined __MINGW32__ trying to fix stuff
[20:16] jonaslund: piscisaureus: no.. look at the line again
[20:16] jonaslund: piscisaureus: the typedef there lacks a semicolon
[20:16] jesusabdullah: lukegalea: So, you already have a chat thing implemented?

[20:19] piscisaureus: jonaslund: no, this: http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/
[20:20] jonaslund: what was the problem with that one ?
[20:20] piscisaureus: erm, nothing
[20:20] piscisaureus: it is the one that comes with mingw
[20:20] jonaslund: oh ok
[20:20] piscisaureus: the only problem is that I couldn't link it statically without causing segfautls
[20:20] jonaslund: you said you tried something else aswell ?
[20:22] jesusabdullah: /!\ ATTENTION /!\: I'm getting to play with a research-grade freezer. I just mashed the set point to -40 C. THAT IS ALL.
[20:22] piscisaureus: jonaslund: I was planning to drop libeio entirely and with that get rid of libpthreads
[20:22] jesusabdullah: This is the good part about my job. Lotsa funky toys.
[20:22] piscisaureus: but that's more of a long term plan
[20:22] jonaslund: piscisaureus: yeah i know

[21:03] slaskis: tjholowaychuk: also, the cookie parsing fails with a cookie with Path= instead of path= (i've added toLowerCase to mine, i hope it won't break anything else)
[21:03] jonaslund: piscisaureus: how is the sys/time.h time.h relationshpi
[21:03] jonaslund: msvc lacks a sys/time.h
[21:03] tjholowaychuk: slaskis: wtf, who uses Path ?
[21:03] tjholowaychuk: ive never even seen that
[21:04] broofa_ has joined the channel
[21:04] jonaslund: piscisaureus: could you try compiling with time.h instead of sys/time.h to see if it works ?
[21:04] jonaslund: piscisaureus: since the sys/time.h dependency is for win32
[21:04] piscisaureus: included from where?
[21:04] jonaslund: eio.c

[21:14] slaskis: tjholowaychuk: another thing with tobi (i know, nag nag) is that the jquery object it exposes is sort of broken, i remember we talked about it earlier here about a month ago
[21:15] tjholowaychuk: slaskis: jquery + jsdom always seems really broken whne i use it
[21:15] slaskis: but it looses context in an $.fn.each 
[21:15] tjholowaychuk: regardless what project
[21:15] slaskis: haha
[21:16] slaskis: well, this particular issue can be fixed though
[21:16] slaskis: don't remember what i did but i got it working last time i played with it
[21:17] tmpvar: tjholowaychuk, have you tried html5 as the parser?
[21:17] slaskis: stupidly enough it doesn't seem like i commited that fix
[21:17] tjholowaychuk: tmpvar: nope not yet, that guy tweeted me saying it was better though
[21:17] tjholowaychuk: ill have to try
[21:17] jonaslund: piscisaureus: hmmm
[21:17] piscisaureus:  ~ ~ ~

[22:14] jonaslund: it seems i can't do *.c :(
[22:15] piscisaureus: jonaslund: libeio is .c too I think?
[22:16] jonaslund: piscisaureus: pthread-win32 has a C file that includes other C files
[22:16] jonaslund: so the sources isn't strictly taking *.c
[22:16] piscisaureus: yeah. baad
[22:16] piscisaureus: libev does that too btw
[22:17] jonaslund: oh my god
[22:17] jonaslund: EVERYTHING seems to be build by includes via pthread.c
[22:18] jonaslund: or maybe that's a simplified file
[22:18] tanepiper: mikeal: actually i had the problem as well using fs.writeFileStream with just http.get if I tried to create a string first to contain the buffer
[22:18] piscisaureus: then just build pthread.c :-)

[22:18] jonaslund: this is just an insane setup

[22:24] tanepiper: mikeal: yea, but how do i buffer data into the stream?
[22:24] mikeal: responseBodyStream
[22:24] mikeal: README dude
[22:24] tanepiper: oh, it throws it's depricated
[22:25] jonaslund: the problem with ORM imho is that it's good for crud stuff, yet alot of what you do with a database is far more complex
[22:25] mikeal: it shouldn't throw
[22:25] Sebmaster: jonaslund: The problem im having with object dbs right now is 1. transactions and 2. relations over the document level
[22:25] mikeal: it should just print a warning
[22:25] mikeal: in master i'm working on a newer api
[22:25] jonaslund: and when you do CRUD.. you want to have transactions.. not usually what the ORM stuff is focused on

[22:27] tanepiper: ok, lemme try that
[22:27] slaskis: tjholowaychuk: using node-jquery instead of the one you have in tobi works better for me, the only thing i changed is to require("jquery") instead of ./jquery/core

[22:28] tjholowaychuk: slaskis: weird, different version of jquery maybe?
[22:29] slaskis: could be, or different node-hacks
[22:29] jonaslund: Sebmaster: maybe there is uses for ORM.. personally i think it's an abstraction that's there for so many wrong reasons
[22:29] slaskis: or commonjs adjustments
[22:30] jonaslund: granted.. i'm comming from the java direction where stuff usually sucks

[22:57] squeek: WebAppsInC: sprintf is a unix thing, not an ECMA thing.

[22:58] Jaye: sadface man
[22:59] fly-away has joined the channel
[22:59] jonaslund: Jaye: sprintf is from C, not php
[22:59] jonaslund: oh phpjs
[22:59] Jaye: yeah
[23:00] Ratty_: Some people like masocism
[23:00] Sebmaster: i guess it should be pretty close to the c implementation^^
[23:00] jonaslund: sprintf isn't that bad though if it follows the format of the C variant
[23:00] jonaslund: (without all the bugs :))

[23:01] WebAppsInC: Sebmaster: Suggesting PHP is an insult where I'm from.
[23:02] WebAppsInC: <-- S. Korea
[23:02] squeek: What's big in the ROK?
[23:02] WebAppsInC: It's a way to say "Slag off, mate"
[23:02] Sebmaster: WebAppsInC: My first language was php :(
[23:02] Sebmaster: now im insulted!
[23:02] Jaye: mine was VB :D
[23:02] Vertice: Sebmaster: many people's first language was php
[23:02] WebAppsInC: squeek: We really like wriiting our web apps in C
[23:02] squeek: WHAT

[23:03] altamic has joined the channel
[23:03] squeek: ＜｀∀´＞ WHAT
[23:03] Sebmaster: i like the concept of node.js more than php tho
[23:04] jonaslund: writing webapps in C kinda fits a country that mandates IE
[23:04] squeek: and mandates activex. urgggh.
[23:05] jonaslund: my first language was basic (on the C64)
[23:05] TobiasFar has joined the channel
[23:05] jonaslund: then qbasic/qb or VB (can't really remember what came first for me)
[23:05] jonaslund: then assembly.. then c/c++
[23:05] wvl: Hey all -- is there a way to get at the parse tree or source code for an object?
[23:05] superjudge has joined the channel
[23:06] jonaslund: then java .. and then a big bunch of other languages finally (but not to a proficient level maybe)
[23:06] bradleymeck: wvl, what kind of object
[23:07] WebAppsInC: We wriite our web apps in C
[23:07] Jaye: sys.inspect
[23:07] Sebmaster: java's vm has such a high startup time :(
[23:07] Sebmaster: too long imo
[23:07] jetienne has left the channel
[23:07] jonaslund: i don't see why that is a big problem
[23:07] jonaslund: actually i don't think it's that long anymore
[23:08] WebAppsInC: Sebmaster: That's why we scrapped JSP and came up with a templating engine that let's you embed C code in HTML
[23:08] sonnym has joined the channel
[23:08] wvl: bradleymeck: Jaye -- I would like to be able to do something like: sys.inspect(sys) and have it return something useful.
[23:08] wvl: ie code + data, not just data...
[23:08] jonaslund: java has very good runtime performance once running and if you've had the patience to write good code
[23:08] bradleymeck: ... it is useful, im not understanding what you want though
[23:08] WebAppsInC: Fucking printf() from inside a <?c ?>!
[23:08] bradleymeck: objects arent code
[23:09] WebAppsInC: It's nice let me tell you.

[23:09] WebAppsInC: What's even more brilliant is that we can embed HTML inside C for loops
[23:10] bradleymeck: sounds a lot like ejs for node
[23:10] barodeur has joined the channel
[23:10] wvl: I'm looking for something like parse_tree or ruby_parser for ruby, but for node
[23:10] bradleymeck: i dont want to deal w/ c types generally
[23:10] WebAppsInC: evl: eval()
[23:11] Jaye: eval is evil :|
[23:11] squeek: string eval is evil. block eval isn't.
[23:12] jonaslund: string eval has it's uses
[23:12] altamic has joined the channel
[23:12] altamic has joined the channel
[23:12] bradleymeck: wvl, so you want a Javascript parser + something that would take an Object and spew back a parse tree that could make that object (and its functions)? If so, we have the parts you need (inimino's parser basically and some know-how of its AST), but we dont have them put together
[23:12] squeek: jonaslund: and none of them involve speed or performance
[23:12] wilmoore has joined the channel
[23:13] fission6 has joined the channel
[23:13] jonaslund: squeek: eval("(function (..) {..})") -> re-use
[23:13] Jaye: for most cases where you can use string eval why not just use the new function constructor?
[23:13] markwubben has joined the channel
[23:13] wvl: yes bradleymeck, exactly. Thanks for the pointer to inimino's parser -- that is more than I'd found.
[23:13] fission6: i just tried fs.writeFileSync ("something.html", "hello") and doesnt seem anything is writing or the file is not being created

[23:14] bradleymeck: Jaye, only reason to use eval over Function is to have access to local scope :P

[23:16] Jaye: fission6: try fs.writeFileSync("./something.html", "hello", "utf-8");

[23:39] mjr_: Yeah, good https is going to be great.
[23:39] indexzero: to be delivered at NodeConf or earlier (his choice)
[23:39] mjr_: Such a great win for node.
