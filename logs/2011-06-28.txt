[00:01] luisloazi: What is all about JSONP?
[00:01] luisloazi: are we talking about a response in JSON format
[00:01] luisloazi: or something else
[00:01] luisloazi: ?
[00:01] Jalava: no
[00:02] Jalava: it's json like response sent as javascript object into callback function
[00:02] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[00:02] Jalava: ie. javascript parses the response with eval together with function call string
[00:02] Jalava: and calls that function with the given js object
[00:02] Jalava: difference is slight but there is a catch with U+2027 and U+2029
[00:03] Jalava: which are not aloud in js objects but are allowed in json
[00:03] Jalava: as keys at least

[01:35] muk_mb: I've read lots of complaining about mongodb and couchdb, are any of these non-sql solutions that aren't huge hassles?
[01:35] mrryanjohnston: hassles?
[01:36] mhooks: Mongo is pretty easy actually.
[01:36] mrryanjohnston: I'm not sure what you've heard but mongo is easy as bals
[01:36] mrryanjohnston: balls*
[01:36] mhooks: so is couch
[01:37] muk_mb: major sites like foursquare that are using mongodb have to use custom binaries,
[01:38] tim_smart has joined the channel
[01:38] mrryanjohnston: muk_mb: I think you're thinking about relational databases vs document based vs else
[01:38] mrryanjohnston: muk_mb: If you're looking for a relational solution, couch/mongo/other non-sql solutions aren't what you want
[01:39] bradleymeck_: muk_mb nosql will always get complaints from DB people because NoSQL is basically removing DB logic from the DBMS into the app, beyond that its not insane, scaling is a little unique to each solution, but you just have to read up on them
[01:39] mrryanjohnston: muk_mb: I don't know much about couch/mongo, but I'd worry about having to build your own custom binary when you have the userbase that foursquare has :p
[01:39] jacter has joined the channel
[01:40] xeodox has joined the channel
[01:40] muk_mb: bradleymeck_: so you think people are writing all these complaints just cause they're used to thinking of things in an SQL world and not this new stuff?

[01:41] ceej has joined the channel
[01:43] bradleymeck_: muk_mb yes, i have had quite a few conversations where they think they "cant" do something in nosql that they can do in sql, just because they cannot comprehend nosql includes a move of db logic into the app instead of everything being in your sql prepared statements
[01:43] bradleymeck_: that and everyone seems to think nosql solutions *randomly drop data*... they dont
[01:43] muk_mb: cause if it's just a matter of thinking differently, I think I can hang

[03:50] smcguinness: bradleymeck_: I saw that, but it didn't seem all that different from what socket.io offered, and I'd still need some way to "push" the messages via php or C#
[03:50] bradleymeck_: smcguinness then you are going to have to look at an external service, pubnub is pretty common
[03:51] cognominal has joined the channel

[10:05] Tocacar: bnoordhuis:  You mean go back to the original install instructions and just include --without-ssl..?  OK, I'll give that go.  Thanks

[10:32] `3rdEden: dall it  has a compile function as well
[10:32] Hadaka: I managed to get npm installed to my home directory somewhat, but no binaries appear in ~/bin even though I have .npmrc set

[10:35] dall: `3rdEden  i mean...how to check if the file has been cached before to read it

[17:25] hydrozen: how tricky is it to query NoSQL databases
[17:25] RickardL: But I'd recommend trying out mongodb, it's really classy
[17:25] hydrozen: is the workflow that much different?
[17:26] RickardL: no, not much - it's a just a different way of expressing your model
[17:27] nibblebot: you also don't do joins and sometimes need to cobble data structures together app side instead of DB side
[17:27] RickardL: It's making it efficient, which makes it harder
[17:27] ctide: is it possible to attach a connect.session to an express server after the server and endpoints have been defined?
[17:27] ctide: https://gist.github.com/81274b09705e95f0b3f6
[17:27] ctide: i use a start function to pass in various config settings (part of which are used to define where sessions are stored)
[17:28] ctide: but it seems that unless i have the app.use(connect.session) stuff physically above all the endpoints in the file
[17:28] ctide: req.session isn't defined for any requests
[17:28] hackband has joined the channel
[17:28] ctide: or if what i'm doing isn't possible, how would one go about this?  wrap all the endpoints within the start function?
[17:29] vid___ has joined the channel
[17:29] RickardL: hydrozen, there are a infinite amount of guides and tutorials on how to begin with mongodb + node.js
[17:29] hydrozen: RickardL: yeah i can imagine
[17:30] hydrozen: i was wondering which to try between mongodb, couchdb, redis, etc.
[17:30] hydrozen: so many choices
[17:30] sweetd has joined the channel
[17:30] RickardL: yeah, it's a hard pick, there are some comparisions - but it's up to how you want to use it

[17:34] _beau: redis has its uses, but i tend to stay away from it for my main DB
[17:34] _beau: the pub/sub on it works great :)
[17:35] hydrozen: I also have another architectural question. My app has clients which are all connected via sockets (socket.io). Then, another system needs to talk to my node.js app which will then send messages to some of the clients through the sockets. Should that other system be connected via socket to my nodejs app too, or should I just use a more regular web service in that case?

[17:37] `3rdEden has joined the channel
[17:38] hydrozen: bradleymeck_:  no theorically that other system will only send "messages" to the nodejs app, but the nodejs app doesnt need to talk to that other system.

[17:52] tbranyen: yeah it looks siginficantly more complex to work with as well
[17:52] RickardL: rabbitmq has great plugins

[18:58] RickardL: lol
[18:59] tjholowaychuk: i'm too late for my hst housing rebate
[18:59] bradleymeck_: robrtpitt most of those are not really priorities, compared to applications that are deployed as services, I would write bindings to things but the windows dll loader does make things interesting when trying to pull in c++ modules for node
[18:59] Prometheus: RickardL: http://nichol.as/zeromq-an-introduction and http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all mention a good bunch of information on load balancing and such

[19:01] RickardL: *reading*

[19:01] configsys: --pulverize
[19:01] Prometheus: I think squash is pretty new stuff
[19:01] Prometheus: relatively :)
[19:01] tjholowaychuk: what does it do
[19:01] niftylettuce: " squash removes any linkage between your original branch and the commit you made on the other branch."
[19:02] tjholowaychuk: niftylettuce i just use git-extra's feature etc stuff. like $ git feature my-feature; git feature finish my-feature

[19:04] RobrtPitt: config, that's a good point, im not 100% tech head when it cmes to the way windows kernal handles event's etc, but im sure they will be more information released at a later data.
[19:06] niftylettuce: gffffffffffffffffff
[19:06] configsys: well, i mean you can do async stuff in windows, as libuv is evidence of that. however, you can't assume that some random windows or other libraries are async

[20:25] asdadsadqq: :)
[20:25] Murvin: eazyigz:  so, for your mongodb, u only have one master process. no replica set?
[20:26] eazyigz: Murvin: i have no idea.  This db is on a different server, and I can connect to it from PHP just fine.
[20:26] eazyigz: Only with this damn module I can't
[20:27] halfhalo has joined the channel
[20:27] Murvin: ask whoever create the mongoDB.  there are problems if replica set with login/password. see if that's the case.
[20:27] threshold has joined the channel
[20:28] Murvin: eazyigz: otherwise, in your node, after you db = new Db( .... ), you just need to do   db.authenticate(user, pass, function() {} );

[20:29] eazyigz: but i find it weird that I can connect just fine from PHP, but not with node-mongodb-native
[20:29] Murvin: eazyigz: yes.. that's similar to the problem I had before.
[20:30] eazyigz: Murvin: I will try mongoskin, have you heard of it

[20:31] Murvin: i am using mongoose
[20:32] jshaw has joined the channel
[20:32] eazyigz: Murvin: doesn't mongoose require you to define a schema before you connect?  That would be a big problem for me, since I do not know the schema
[20:32] eazyigz: and the schema can change any time
[20:32] eazyigz: whole point of mongodb is to be flexible, not like the rigid relational databases used to be
[20:32] Murvin: yes.. in this case, u have to do native
[20:32] dmose has joined the channel
[20:33] Murvin: depending on the application.  no definitely good or bad about it.

[21:28] patcito has joined the channel
[21:28] tjholowaychuk: and harder to look at
[21:28] rixius: not should be unique because of the number of options

[21:30] tim_smart: tjholowaychuk: Yeah I found Step etc annoying. Helpful - but annoying.
[21:30] tjholowaychuk: tim_smart are all the error(s) deferred ?
[21:30] tjholowaychuk: or do you handle in each callback
[21:30] tjholowaychuk: it would be nice to have only the one callback to worry about for errors
[21:30] tim_smart: tjholowaychuk: next(error, whatever)
[21:31] antlong: really random numbers, http://fourmilab.ch/hotbits/
[21:31] tim_smart: .done(function (error, result_async_array) { ... })
[21:31] tim_smart: tjholowaychuk: Take a look at test.js
[21:31] tjholowaychuk: tim_smart: i guess it wouldnt work for all cases, but it would be nice to leave out error for all except exec() or done()
[21:31] tjholowaychuk: yeah i'll take a look
[21:32] AvianFlu has joined the channel
[21:32] tim_smart: tjholowaychuk: exec() justs start it, so you can save operations for later

[21:32] tjholowaychuk: doesn't really matter, makes sense now though :D
[21:32] tjholowaychuk: ohhh i know
[21:33] mscdex: it really hertz to not have more cores

[21:45] tbranyen: jerrysv: yea heh
[21:45] rixius: Tobsn: you also have to see that, in almost the same number of characters, mine is an actual reusable but of code(I.E callable) whereas your's happens once

[21:45] \sega has joined the channel
[21:45] tjholowaychuk: onr: most of these parser generators substr() the string
[21:45] tjholowaychuk: which is the expensive part

[22:00] antlong: rixius: Version 4 (random) : Version 4 UUIDs use a scheme relying only on random numbers. This algorithm sets the version number as well as two reserved bits. All other bits are set using a random or pseudorandom data source. Version 4 UUIDs have the form xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx where x is any hexadecimal digit and y is one of 8, 9, A, or B. e.g. f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479.

[22:29] broofa: tjholowaychuk it is, it is!   but to get the bitwise representation of -2 you take invert all the bits and add one.
[22:29] tbranyen: fwg: you can throw that loop body in the second argument of the for loop and remove the semicolon before return

[22:30] tjholowaychuk: broofa isn't one's complement -(n+1) ?

[22:54] jerrysv: fwg: awesome. about to go to beer, will have to look again in the morning (or after a few beers)
