[00:00] benw_: Everything that should happen after the user existence check should happen *inside* the callback.
[00:00] techwraith: just move line 21 to line 57
[00:00] techwraith: and tab everything in :)
[00:00] techwraith: yep, that's the standard
[00:00] benw_: yup
[00:00] AntelopeSalad: that does make sense, my brain is struggling (but sort of managing) to understand the concept of what's actually going on

[00:02] etaty: async callback ... everybody the first time say why all my vars are empty?
[00:02] tetsu: Starting out on node.js today, would you guys have any good tutorials/starter materials and suggestions for me
[00:03] sirkitre_ has joined the channel
[00:03] AntelopeSalad: sweet, it now works as intended
[00:03] techwraith: :)
[00:03] SubStack: tetsu: have you done much javascript or functional programming before?
[00:03] benw_: AntelopeSalad: I recommend writing small functions that take a callback as a final parameter, to break this up into smaller pieces. Makes for better code.
[00:04] benw_: AntelopeSalad: Most of your functions will pass result arguments to the callback, rather than returning anything.
[00:04] tetsu: SubStack: I have done a lot of javascript programming, so i'm aware of asynchronous callbacks and prototypes and all, but I can't say I have adopted any good conventions
[00:05] SubStack: or if the problem doesn't lend itself to naming the intermediate steps flow control libs can help
[00:05] SubStack: flow control libs are also handy for tricky parallel aggregation operations
[00:05] benw_: asyncForEach is a handy function to have around sometimes.

[00:06] vikstrous: hey guys, any help figuring out how variable scope works for jade templates in express?
[00:06] SubStack: tetsu: well there is http://howtonode.org/ but perhaps just looking at existing projects and having http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.6/api/all.html handy will work for you
[00:06] SubStack: tetsu: do you have anything you're trying to build in particular?
[00:06] tetsu: SubStack: are there any noteable projects to look at? should i invest in a framework?
[00:07] techwraith: http://nodebeginner.org/
[00:07] SubStack: there isn't much "investment" with node libs
[00:07] tetsu: SubStack: well, im not usually a game programmer by nature, but i loved the real-time communications, so i thought id make a stupid game

[00:19] benw_: I'm more concerned with repeatability than publishing so far, but thanks
[00:19] isaacs: benw_: just like a normal dep, then do "bundledDependencies":["dep"] to make sure that it doens't ever try to install hte "real" version

[03:04] mscdex: so it has to pull in a boat load of 32bit libs
[03:04] mscdex: :s
[03:04] Nexxy: just how big is a boat load?
[03:04] mscdex: a sizable load
[03:05] Nexxy: lol
[03:05] mscdex: sheesh and it's not even the latest version of wine
[03:06] Nexxy: wow

[03:16] mscdex: i know how it goes, but that would be ideal
[03:16] fakewaffle: yeah it would
[03:16] Nexxy: ACTION would contribute to something like that
[03:17] fakewaffle: i started off that way, and i had a test datasource called turd working with reads, and some read functionally working with mysql
[03:17] fakewaffle: but i dont know what direction i want to go, lol
[03:17] fakewaffle: actually, it was called stool haha
[03:17] Nexxy: ok you'd have to rename it though
[03:17] Nexxy: I don't play with poo.
[03:17] Nexxy: one of my very few rules.
[03:18] fakewaffle: if i get my shit together with it a bit more, would you guys be willing to help out?

[03:24] mscdex: just use cakephp as a guide i'd say
[03:24] mscdex: see how they do it
[03:24] mscdex: that should give you some idea at least
[03:25] fakewaffle: at least they are all working with sql though?

[03:35] beriberikix: it gets returned and I can do a console.log
[03:36] beriberikix: but when I try to throw the code in a constructor, it returns an empty obj
[03:36] fakewaffle: paste it in pastebin or something?
[03:36] mscdex: readFile shouldn't return anything?
[03:36] mscdex: readFileSync on the other hand will....
[03:36] fakewaffle: mscdex: he did mention in the callback

[04:01] tetsu: how do i send images to the browser with nodejs?

[04:02] rpflo has joined the channel
[04:02] tetsu: Nexxy: hmm.
[04:02] Nexxy: tetsu: as long as you define the root directory for static files
[04:02] Nexxy: anything requested that is a static file and is publicly accessible will be served
[04:03] Nexxy: plus I'd imagine if you're developing a web app, there are a lot of other useful things express can do for you
[04:03] mscdex: beriberikix: here's a version that uses libxmljs: https://gist.github.com/416021  and here's one that uses a pure js xml parser (sax from npm): https://github.com/mscdex/node-nntp/blob/master/examples/nzb/nzb.js#L155
[04:04] mscdex: you'll have to tailor the latter to your own needs since it's not a generic function, but it's pretty similar to the libxmljs one
[04:04] beriberikix: mscdex: *bows*
[04:04] beriberikix: mscdex: thanks!
[04:05] tetsu: Nexxy: well this will be a lot more complicated to learn than i had hoped, i thought i was almost done with my little project :p, but it looks worth the try
[04:05] tetsu: thanks for the suggestion
[04:05] tetsu: Nexxy: do you know if i can attach Socket.IO to an Express server?

[04:09] Nexxy: como estas!
[04:10] XYXing: I wrote a simple tool to embed NODEjs code into html file, just like eRuby~
[04:10] mscdex: you reinvented ejs?
[04:10] mscdex: :S
[04:10] Nexxy: lol
[04:10] XYXing: not ejs
[04:10] Nexxy: I was just about to type that ;<
[04:10] fakewaffle has left the channel
[04:10] XYXing: ejs is just embeded javascript
[04:10] fakewaffle has joined the channel
[04:11] mscdex: you can use node stuff in there too
[04:11] fakewaffle: command + w closes stuff, fyi
[04:11] XYXing: ejs can not interact iwth , for example, mongoose
[04:11] halfhalo: lol
[04:11] mscdex: why would you want to use mongoose within your view?
[04:11] halfhalo: that's just... wrong
[04:11] XYXing: yup, I agree with it
[04:12] XYXing: that's entirely wrong
[04:12] mscdex: eh?
[04:12] halfhalo: wait.... can you pass in mongoose to ejs?
[04:12] Nexxy: lol
[04:12] mscdex: if you can catch one
[04:12] Nexxy: why would you do that?
[04:12] XYXing: just for example (for fun ?), we can write NODE in html, it's fun 
[04:12] halfhalo: ACTION is now curious
[04:13] stalled has joined the channel
[04:13] mscdex: XYXing: but why?
[04:13] mscdex: you should strive to keep only layout and data display stuff in there
[04:13] Nexxy: doesn't that kinda break MVC?
[04:13] mscdex: no business logic or anything
[04:13] XYXing: ejs can't include node modules such as mongoose I guess
[04:14] Nexxy: that's not its job
[04:14] XYXing: yup, directly envoke data in view shoild break MVC architecture
[04:14] halfhalo: I will admit, I do have some logc in my views such as (if blah do foo else bar), but that's it
[04:14] Nexxy: shame
[04:15] mscdex: halfhalo: well that's not that bad
[04:15] halfhalo: its generally for hiding a link or so, that's it
[04:15] Nexxy: I can understand using logic liek for alternating row colors and stuff like that
[04:15] mscdex: but doing database calls and filesystem calls is just bleh
[04:15] halfhalo: yah, fck that
[04:15] mscdex: i have to maintain a big php project that currently does crap like that
[04:16] mscdex: it's very stressful
[04:16] XYXing: I do that just firfun, because I played eRuby before, and wanna write some stuffs like that

[04:18] tetsu: that was amazing
[04:18] Nexxy: tetsu: thank tj! he's the one that made it! ;3
[04:19] tetsu: i deleted half of it
[04:19] Nexxy: isn't it though?
[04:19] XYXing: obviously, to emded NODE codes into html can not spur and guy's interest XD~ha~
[04:19] halfhalo: try/catch?
[04:19] Nexxy: XYXing: try drawing some boobs on it
[04:19] Nexxy: they'll be all over it

[04:38] mscdex: fakewaffle: like i said earlier, just start out by following what cakephp does
[04:38] mscdex: they probably have some subclassing going on
[04:38] fakewaffle: yeah, inception style
[04:39] mscdex: like some basic data source thing, then probably they have an sql subclass
[04:39] mscdex: then mysql and postgres et al are subclasses of that
[04:39] mscdex: you'd have to look though, but i think it's something like that

[05:02] tetsu: if I want to share state information of several actors client-side, but I don't want to do a socket.send() on every keypress, is a setInterval a terrible idea?
[05:02] benw_: BHSPitMonkey: marcab: The pegjs lib does a good job of that.
[05:02] pyrotechnick1 has joined the channel
[05:03] pyrotechnick1: hey lads
[05:03] tetsu: I could have socket.io accept a message from each player, and broadcast their new location out, but that would be a lot of duplicated data if several people were moving at once
[05:03] pyrotechnick1: anyone know of an inflection library actually published on npm?
[05:03] pyrotechnick1: i just want camelCase -> camel_case
[05:03] BHSPitMonkey: benw_: I'll check it out, thanks!
[05:03] benw_: np
[05:05] BHSPitMonkey: tetsu: I'm facing the same decisions right now, too.  I think as long as ordering is preserved, batching input events and sending them on an interval would be okay.
[05:05] balaa has joined the channel
[05:05] tetsu: BHSPitMonkey: are you using socket.io?
[05:06] BHSPitMonkey: yes
[05:06] BHSPitMonkey: not that it's really important, when we're talking about design at an abstract level
[05:06] tetsu: I thought Socket.IO might have already had an 'interval updater' built in
[05:07] tetsu: does it send data over like once a second
[05:07] tetsu: for something
[05:07] BHSPitMonkey: tetsu: I believe it does have some sort of heartbeat, not sure of its regularity though

[05:13] pyrotechnick1: have u ever used rack?

[05:13] tetsu: BHSPitMonkey: if we're just transferring state information periodically, is there a way to make a socket.send() return data to the client? do an update_and_get
[05:13] pyrotechnick1: connect is like node's rack/cgi/middleware
[05:13] pyrotechnick1: and express sits on that
[05:13] pyrotechnick1: connect gives you vhosts i think

[05:15] nulled_: like create gifs jpgs etc
[05:15] BHSPitMonkey: tetsu: not sure what you mean
[05:15] pyrotechnick1: the best place to start is http://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules
[05:15] nulled_: ok thanks
[05:15] pyrotechnick1: but its pretty hard, especially as a noob, to know which is better
[05:15] nulled_: does node support multi CPUs? 
[05:15] pyrotechnick1: because there's so many options, options is a good thing in the end, but very difficult to get started with
[05:15] pyrotechnick1: kind of
[05:15] BHSPitMonkey: tetsu: but I should advise you that I'm in the same boat you are;  I'm working on my first real multiplayer node game and I've only just begun making these decisions
[05:16] nulled_: yeah node.js will condense in time
[05:16] pyrotechnick1: to really milk the most out of a machine you need to spawn many instances but there's libraries to help with that, the best IMHO is cluster
[05:16] pyrotechnick1: the os module reports on cpu/other system information and cluster uses that to try and launch an optimal amount of "workers"
[05:17] nulled_: anyone use Cloude9ide?
[05:17] pyrotechnick1: you might want to read through the higher level docs on nodejs.org it sort of explains what node is about
[05:17] tetsu: BHSPitMonkey: same boat then :). what i'm saying is, if we are sending the data every 1/20th of a second, and we want to send the client back data every 1/20th of a second, we would still need a poller to get that data back into the client, wouldnt we?
[05:17] pyrotechnick1: ive tried a few times but it always bugs out for us
[05:17] tetsu: i guess i havent done any server->client socket stuff yet
[05:17] pyrotechnick1: i think my account is a bit dodgy
[05:17] pyrotechnick1: nulled_: PHP/PHP_GD/PHP_MySQL/sha1/md5/Apache2/PHP_Sessions/Cookies
[05:17] pyrotechnick1: as for mysql there's an adapter for node
[05:18] pyrotechnick1: otherwise you might want to look into redis / mongo / couchdb
[05:18] pyrotechnick1: they're all noSQL
[05:18] BHSPitMonkey: tetsu: hmm, I'm not sure if I'd want to try sending messages that rapidly, but then again I've never seen firsthand how it holds up under that pressure.
[05:18] BHSPitMonkey: tetsu: it's highly unlikely that your user will be generating input that quickly...
[05:18] tetsu: BHSPitMonkey: i've seen it do very well at 50ms :)
[05:18] pyrotechnick1: redis is pretty cool, especially when you're just getting started out, it aligns well with the simplicity of js's objects/hashes
[05:18] ExsysTech has joined the channel
[05:19] pyrotechnick1: but if u want query try mongo or couch or just use mysql/postgres
[05:19] pyrotechnick1: that should be enough to replace your stack
[05:19] BHSPitMonkey: tetsu: my initial plan is to send keyboard/click events to the server as they happen, which shouldn't be nearly that often
[05:19] pyrotechnick1: remember that the modules wiki article is your friend and so is http://search.npmjs.org/
[05:20] tetsu: BHSPitMonkey: oh, that may be a better idea than position
[05:20] AntelopeSalad: couch is pretty easy to pickup as a newbie too
[05:20] AntelopeSalad: interacting with it is only slightly more complicated than the node hello world app
[05:20] BHSPitMonkey: tetsu: in any multiplayer game that matters, you want to simulate the world on the server side, and only receive user input from the clients

[05:22] tetsu: BHSPitMonkey: ive made links and setIntervals to socket.send(data) from client to server, but i dont know how the server sends data to the client
[05:23] tetsu: BHSPitMonkey: any hints for an idiot?
[05:23] BHSPitMonkey: so if you do something weird/malicious on your client (like changing a velocity variable to 10x), only the user will see that change, and only for a brief moment

[05:58] XYXing: these templating engines are cool ! but enode is not a templating engine, it can use node.js mudules directly in ur html file

[07:05] Ond: Uh, I mean, a regular node conference
[07:05] Nexxy: is there a node meetup that *isn't* just a beer & sausage fest
[07:05] Ond: What's your talk about, tyler-iphone
[07:06] Nexxy: tyler-iphone: if anyone asks you if you ordered a bucket, say yes
[07:06] Wa: make sure to cram the need for a bucket in there
[07:06] Nexxy: please and thank you <3

[07:06] tyler-iphone: Ond: dirty little hacks, how to use and abuse nodejs
[07:06] Nexxy: hawt
[07:06] tprice: when i do multiple writes to a socket does it come out on the other end as 3 peaces or does it get sent randomly?
[07:07] tprice: like each of the 3 randomly
[07:07] Wa: tcp ensures the order generally, but I can't speak for node
[07:07] tyler-iphone: zeromq ftw
[07:07] Wa: udp doesn't ensure order though

[07:09] mscdex: tprice: it'll be exactly as you sent it
[07:10] mscdex: tprice: depending on the size of the string though, it may not be transferred in one packet though
[07:10] Wa: oh I was talking about packet order, not order within a packet. Both protocols should keep the structure you send it as :p
[07:11] tprice: <mscdex> do you know what the string length would be?
[07:11] mscdex: huh?
[07:11] Nexxy: lol
[07:11] Nexxy: I don't think "psychic" is in his job description
[07:11] mscdex: 73!

[07:11] Wa: I believe
[07:11] mscdex: :)
[07:12] Nexxy: wait let me check my lucky numbers
[07:12] mscdex: isn't it like 1500 bytes for normal ethernet packets?
[07:12] TomY has joined the channel
[07:12] tprice: so there is not a set length for a packet of a tcp connection?
[07:13] littke has joined the channel
[07:13] Nexxy: 10 13 15 28 30 41
[07:13] Wa: a max length maybe, not a fixed one
[07:13] Nexxy: "A pleasant surprise is in store for you soon."
[07:13] mscdex: you can change the MTU, but 1500 is the max i think
[07:13] Nexxy: ^-^
[07:13] mscdex: unless you use jumbo frames, but that's not widely supported
[07:13] mscdex: last i checked

[07:15] tprice: what would be the best method to test that the string the the full string and not just half of it?
[07:16] Nexxy: what are you trying to do?
[07:16] click_ has joined the channel
[07:16] Nexxy: that might help us figure out how to answer your question
[07:16] mscdex: tprice: don't worry about it, your string will get sent
[07:16] Nexxy: unless you're doing something really hacky, I doubt you need to worry about things on the tcp/ip level
[07:16] Wa: I'd imagine something like node abstracts all that verification and ordering and crap for you, yeah?
[07:16] Wa: or at least can
[07:17] mscdex: tcp does

[07:19] confoocious has joined the channel
[07:19] mscdex: tprice: is it a node process on the receiving end ?
[07:19] tprice: now i can wrap each string but but its hard to know whats been cut off
[07:19] mscdex: what is your setup?
[07:19] Nexxy: confoocious: you should set your client to identify to nickserv before joining channels ;3
[07:19] awenkhh has joined the channel
[07:19] tprice: <mscdex> sending and receiving 
[07:20] Tobsn: anyone an idea why i couldnt use node to pipe access log data to it?
[07:20] tprice: its a tcp client and server that im building
[07:20] Tobsn: it somehow just doesnt wil within the webserver process
[07:21] mscdex: tprice: ok, so then just socket.write() the string on the sender end and on the receiver just have a string where you append on each 'data' event
[07:21] mscdex: tprice: you may want to look into using a json protocol module instead of reinventing the wheel
[07:21] mscdex: it'll save you some time
[07:22] Nexxy: mscdex++
[07:22] v8bot:  Nexxy has given a beer to mscdex. mscdex now has 14 beers.

[07:23] tprice: if you write 3 time to the socket you could only get 2 'data' event on the receiving end
[07:23] tprice: or you could get 3 "data" events
[07:23] raja has joined the channel
[07:23] tprice: or event one
[07:23] mscdex: tprice: right
[07:24] Tobsn: mscdex, https://gist.github.com/caa6299e363b24e22af9
[07:24] tprice: how can i limit the size of a packet been been sent with node
[07:24] mscdex: tprice: you could try something like this: https://gist.github.com/880514
[07:24] Nexxy: tprice: I think the point here is that you really don't need to if all you're trying to do is send json
[07:24] mscdex: tprice: just disregard the 'upgrade' part
[07:24] Tobsn: i set chmod +x and it works within the shell, even with su www-data it writes into the access log with echo "lala" | /www/utils/log.js
[07:24] Tobsn: but it doesnt work within lighttpd
[07:25] Tobsn: i strace'd lighttpd pid and saw this:  222) = -1 EPIPE (Broken pipe)
[07:25] mscdex: Tobsn: remove 644 and replace it with '0644'
[07:25] Tobsn: on the write() to the pipe

[07:26] darshan-mobile has joined the channel
[07:26] Tobsn: and it writes into the file
[07:26] Tobsn: it cant be permissions anymore, i rather guess that i have to change the process stuff
[07:26] mscdex: Tobsn: also, i'm not sure your fs.write() looks right
[07:27] Tobsn: well it writes
[07:27] Marak has joined the channel
[07:27] Tobsn: like i said, a simple echo "lala" | log.js writes correctly into access.log
[07:27] mscdex: :S
[07:27] Tobsn: exactly
[07:27] Tobsn: i think its something with the process stuff
[07:27] mscdex: your fs.write() writes to it?
[07:27] Tobsn: yep
[07:27] Tobsn: the write works
[07:27] Tobsn: no doubt

[07:28] Tobsn: thats probably the node.js process
[07:28] saschagehlich_ has joined the channel
[07:28] mscdex: heh who knows.... lighthttpd could be doing something screwy
[07:28] Tobsn: i think lighttpd starts the process and thinks its still open while node stops the process
[07:28] mscdex: especially if you're appending fine
[07:28] Druide_ has joined the channel
[07:29] Tobsn: can i set the process stdin somehow on listen so it stays open?
[07:29] lethalduck has joined the channel
[07:29] mscdex: on listen?
[07:30] Tobsn: the process terminates right after the pipe
[07:30] Tobsn: echo "lala" | log.js
[07:30] Tobsn: instantly terminates
[07:30] Tobsn: calling the process directly ./log.js will also instantly terminate
[07:30] lethalduck: pyrotechnick1 no.de looks dam expensive compared to EC2
[07:30] pyrotechnick1: my bad
[07:31] Tobsn: and EC2 looks damn unstable compared to rackspace cloud
[07:31] Tobsn: ;)
[07:31] mscdex: Tobsn: huh... i dunno, but also you should probably not put fs.open in your 'data' event handler
[07:31] Nexxy: O snap
[07:31] tyler-iphone: why do people write foo++ instead of foo ++?
[07:31] Tobsn: ah
[07:31] Tobsn: true
[07:31] pyrotechnick1: because it's a unary operator
[07:31] mscdex: tyler-iphone: because foo ++ doesn't look right
[07:31] Tobsn: tyler-iphone, cause its  foo++
[07:31] pyrotechnick1: spaces are for binary/turnery operators
[07:31] mscdex: besides, ++foo is faster than foo++ !

[07:32] Tobsn: lethalduck, in 2009 i killed their servers on a daily schedule... now they run rock solid
[07:32] tyler-iphone: it should be written (++ foo)
[07:32] tyler-iphone: heh
[07:32] Wa: o.O

[09:17] viktors: had the same problems with ruby before, had to switch to rvm
[09:18] christkv has joined the channel

[09:18] Wa: hello ryah 
[09:18] `3rdEden: viktors: you using jetienne ubuntu releases?
[09:18] ryah: hello
[09:18] viktors: Wa: mongodb 1.8 isn't even released for Natty yet
[09:18] Wa: viktors; not even in a different repo? :S
[09:18] viktors: Wa: not even 10gen repo
[09:19] Lorentz: Debian, debian all the way
[09:19] Wa: viktors; well I hear gentoo uses a script-based installation that can grab stuff straight from gits and etc
[09:19] Wa: but kinda..hard to use..

[09:20] viktors: `3rdEden: what is jetienne? (i'm trying to start using natty)
[09:20] thalll: exec doesnt preserv quotes, ex exec('\'watch "cat /bla/bla"\'') will result in error ;S
[09:20] jetienne: viktors: i maintain a deb for ubuntu stable for nodejs stable
[09:20] `3rdEden: viktors: jetienne is a node user ;) he manages a ppa
[09:21] `3rdEden: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jerome-etienne/neoip && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nodejs
[09:21] jetienne: `3rdEden: hehe :)
[09:21] viktors: Wa: i kind of like ubuntu - it has good cloud/EBS support, and just works in most cases, but this old software is really becoming a problem
[09:21] jacter has joined the channel
[09:21] `3rdEden: my copy and paste powers > jetienne's copy and paste powers :)
[09:21] Wa: viktors; yeah I know, it bugs me too :(
[09:21] jetienne: viktors: due to the ubuntu upgrade, they compiling box are super slow, but this is inprogress
[09:21] jetienne: `3rdEden: indeed :)
[09:22] `3rdEden: ;D
[09:22] viktors: `3rdEden: thanks for the repo tip, will try that (i was going to use n)

[09:25] viktors: DeltachaosDeskto: yep (perl then php then ruby then node)
[09:25] Wa: I'm not completely switched over yet, but I'm coming from php in terms of web dev :p

[09:26] jonaslund: jetienne: how does it go with your games ?
[09:26] `3rdEden: just taking baby steps at a time :p
[09:27] jetienne: jonaslund: not bad, polishing a version of each to present them in a contest
[09:27] jonaslund: jetienne: oh what contest ?
[09:27] DeltachaosDeskto: and how do you serve node stuff?
[09:27] DeltachaosDeskto: do you bin to port 80 directry or do setup nginx before and server images and stuff over this and use node as proxy
[09:27] jetienne: jonaslund: the contest is more a pretext to make more polished game, i hear too much that "wow this is nice demo"
[09:27] DeltachaosDeskto: *bind
[09:27] jetienne: jonaslund: a google chrome web store one
[09:27] DeltachaosDeskto: *directly
[09:28] jetienne: jonaslund: a small french contest to dev chrome web store
[09:28] jonaslund: cool
[09:28] jonaslund: jetienne: this is the pacman thingy or ?
[09:28] jetienne: jonaslund: yep now i want users. so the game has to be fun and polished :) enduser doesnt care about webgl skills :)
[09:29] jonaslund: true true
[09:29] Tobsn: when mongoq returns err == null - that means everything should be ok, right?
[09:29] jonaslund: jetienne: I made a canvas based game for ludum dare 48 hours this weekend
[09:29] jetienne: jonaslund: http://pacmaze.com is the pacman in 3D, http://buddymaze.com is a fps with a strong link on twitter/social network
[09:29] jonaslund: jetienne: works "well" on most current browsers apart from FF 3 :P

[09:34] jetienne: jonaslund: move are still glitchy, im stuck. will you go on with it ?
[09:34] jonaslund: pondering on it
[09:34] jonaslund: Maybe porting it to iOs / Android
[09:35] jonaslund: I came up with a bunch of cool ideas at a late stage of making it
[09:35] jetienne: jonaslund: could you do it in phonegap ? thus coding it once for web/ios/android ?
[09:35] Nexxy: sounds like someone I know
[09:35] jonaslund: jetienne: I'm gonna try that at first
[09:36] jonaslund: jetienne: It runs on mobile safari
[09:36] saschagehlich_: `3rdEden: ping
[09:36] jonaslund: jetienne: but sloooowly
[09:36] `3rdEden: plong
[09:36] `3rdEden: saschagehlich_: instant responses!
[09:36] saschagehlich_: one thing that just came to my mind
[09:36] jetienne: jonaslund: keep me updated, im interested by the reuslt
[09:36] saschagehlich_: AWESOME
[09:36] `3rdEden: ;D
[09:36] saschagehlich_: that's not the thing that came to my mind actually
[09:36] saschagehlich_: ehm
[09:36] `3rdEden: oh
[09:36] jetienne: jonaslund: to go in ios/android market would be cool, but if i had to dev all in native code, this is becoming a lot of work
[09:36] jonaslund: jetienne: But there is 2 main issues with the code i think, and i wouldn't be surprised if it's the same issues that hampers the FF 3 version
[09:37] jonaslund: jetienne: Well i made a prototype JS-C translator in 2 weeks just before xmas
[09:37] saschagehlich_: connect_failed on flashsocket => reason: firewall blocking all other ports than 80, port 843 not reachable?
[09:37] jetienne: jonaslund: you should get it working with ff3, this is not a bad browser
[09:37] jonaslund: jetienne: I think i had like 3x slower code than chrome for some small recursive function tests
[09:37] jonaslund: (fib.. :D )
[09:37] jetienne: jonaslund: hehe :)
[09:37] jonaslund: but the test had most aspects of running code implemented
[09:37] jetienne: jonaslund: have you looked the impactjs stuff ? he did good on it
[09:38] jetienne: jonaslund: porting his framework to jscore and removing webkit entirely. he got double or triple perf
[09:38] jonaslund: jscore ?
[09:38] Waha has joined the channel

[09:39] `3rdEden: saschagehlich_: if the socket.io's server cant serve a flash policy file, the flash player will request the policy file inline, and socket.io will answer that
[09:39] jetienne: jonaslund: so he "just" got the opensource jsengine, added the modif he wanted, added a graphic/audio layer and youpla :)
[09:39] saschagehlich_: damn
[09:39] `3rdEden: you can search your logs for `answering flash policy file inline` to see those
[09:39] saschagehlich_: CONNECT_FAILED Y U APPEAR
[09:40] jetienne: jonaslund: this is a nice move for him. and us we can license if needed
[09:40] `3rdEden: I HAZ NO CLUE
[09:40] jetienne: jonaslund: i dunno if he will port that on android
[09:40] Wa has joined the channel
[09:40] `3rdEden: saschagehlich_: the requests you are doing are crossdomain right
[09:40] jonaslund: jetienne: Is this something he used on appstore ?
[09:40] jetienne: jonaslund: yep let me find the link
[09:40] jonaslund: jetienne: I know that V8 runs on jailbroken iPhones but not normal ones.
[09:41] jetienne: http://impactjs.com/blog/2011/04/iosimpact-beta <- jonaslund this is what im talking about

[09:43] Tobsn: erm, is anyone working with mongoq or native mongodb? it seems to insert something (err=null, doc returns new _id) but there is nothing in mongodb itself... ?!
[09:43] Tobsn: hey 3rdeden ;)
[09:43] `3rdEden: saschagehlich_: i'm just outputting my brain farts here, as I simply don't have any other explaination
[09:43] `3rdEden: ello
[09:44] `3rdEden: Tobsn: force a fsync?
[09:44] Tobsn: hu?
[09:44] jonaslund: jetienne: ok i just read through the blog post about the internals
[09:44] saschagehlich_: lol
[09:44] jonaslund: jetienne: his stuff does NOT use the JIT
[09:44] Tobsn: should i force a .save() or something?
[09:45] `3rdEden: yes
[09:45] jonaslund: jetienne: right now my code is pretty raw on JS performance (i think) since i just do all collisions without any spatial culling whatsoever
[09:45] `3rdEden: because save is just fire and forget.. so you wont know wtf is going on in your database
[09:45] Tobsn: coll.insert([{'blah':123}]); coll.save()
[09:45] jetienne: jonaslund: and you dont need much for the ants
[09:45] Tobsn: or just save() ?
[09:45] `3rdEden: uhmmm
[09:45] jetienne: jonaslund: but his stuff is gaining a lot on the drawing
[09:45] `3rdEden: *googles the documentation*
[09:45] Tobsn: i cant find any docs on that stuff
[09:45] jonaslund: jetienne: well each ant or beetle is collided towards the world atleast once per frame
[09:45] Tobsn: yeah tell me where you find that ;)
[09:46] tarrant_ has joined the channel
[09:46] Tobsn: all i could find are examples with 15 callbacks cascaded into each other
[09:46] jetienne: jonaslund: bench collision vs drawing
[09:46] pyrotechnick1: You guys should try and get in touch with someone from ngmoco
[09:46] `3rdEden: insert( your object, {save:true }, function(){})
[09:46] jetienne: jonaslund: i bet drawing is 10time more
[09:46] jonaslund: jetienne: I don't use tiles. It's all arbitrary rectangles that define the world and arbitrary images that makes up the graphics
[09:46] `3rdEden: try that Tobsn
[09:46] Tobsn: k
[09:46] jonaslund: jetienne: Drawing is what is slowing down FF 3
[09:47] jonaslund: jetienne: but all of the platforms i run on now are JIT compiled
[09:47] Tobsn: returns _id
[09:47] Tobsn: but nothing in DB
[09:47] Tobsn: also just tried save instead of insert(), same result
[09:47] hwinkel has joined the channel
[09:47] jetienne: jonaslund: cool
[09:47] `3rdEden: Tobsn: odd
[09:48] Tobsn: yep very
[09:48] `3rdEden: mongohq does feel a big sluggish today
[09:48] Tobsn: the funny thing is that the callback even returns an _id
[09:48] Tobsn: which should mean it inserted it
[09:48] Tobsn: but the collections is empty
[09:48] jonaslund: jetienne: anyhow, my very naive precompiler for JS code was not much slower than using Chrome for the benchmark
[09:48] `3rdEden: the id's are generated by the driver
[09:49] `3rdEden: not by a server Tobsn
[09:49] Tobsn: hmm
[09:49] Tobsn: well so why isnt it saving it?!
[09:49] jonaslund: jetienne: So i'm pondering on expanding it with some Profile Guided optimizations
[09:49] bergie has joined the channel
[09:49] `3rdEden: the {save} option didn't give back any information Tobsn?
[09:49] jonaslund: jetienne: and generating binary code directly instead of C as an intermediate
[09:50] `3rdEden: And you sure that you have a connection established? you can return data from the server?
[09:50] Tobsn: echo "lala" | ./log.js
[09:50] Tobsn: null
[09:50] Tobsn: [{"r":"lala","_id":"4dbfcf59ed33499b34000001"}]
[09:50] jetienne: jonaslund: if you got a way to speed up javascript in realitic cases, it will usefull for many :)
[09:50] jonaslund: jetienne: doing that i could produce binary code for iOS that'd run fast
[09:50] Tobsn: err\ndoc
[09:50] ajpiaNOU has joined the channel
[09:50] nexxy has joined the channel
[09:50] jonaslund: jetienne: Well.. basically i'd give a damn about desktop JS like the browsers does well already
[09:51] `3rdEden: Tobsn: really odd
[09:51] jonaslund: jetienne: but instead provide a way for high perf js on mobiles (for games mainly)
[09:51] Tobsn: im gonna gist it
[09:51] Tobsn: maybe im missing something
[09:51] jetienne: jonaslund: high perf js in itself is only a part of mobile gaming issues
[09:51] viktors: old mongodb problem i had was because i was using old url for the repo, the format (hostname etc) has changed since then, the new one is deb http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/ubuntu-upstart dist 10gen
[09:51] jetienne: jonaslund: you need good sound, and good graphics
[09:51] xeodox: What's the best redis client?
[09:52] jetienne: jonaslund: ok going to work , i need to do with light pool :)
[09:52] jonaslund: jetienne: emulating canvas and possibly webGL later would not be that hard
[09:52] jonaslund: canvas especially isn't that big
[09:52] jetienne: jonaslund: and excanvas already do emulation, it may be a good source
[09:52] jonaslund: and afaik webGL is more or less GLES that's already on the iPhone
[09:53] jetienne: it is
[09:53] jetienne: a nice compatible implementation would be so nice

[10:07] chjj: v8: 'a'.charAt(0);
[10:07] v8bot: chjj: "a"
[10:08] jonaslund: then there is string.charCodeAt(x)
[10:08] Tobsn: Cannot call method 'charAt' of undefined

[10:08] Wa: yeah, that
[10:08] `3rdEden: (str + '').charAt() ;D?

[10:08] `3rdEden: str can still be a number than chjj
[10:09] Tobsn: yeah, looks like str is undefined

[10:19] Tobsn: fyi, wedding on necker island + food and one night for 28 people = 53,000 dollar
[10:19] nexxy: jonaslund: kinda
[10:19] Tobsn: am i the only one who thinks that pretty cheap for 28 people

[10:25] nexxy: hey that reminds me...
[10:25] chjj: yeah, we go from talking about doubles and ints to talking about owning private islands as billionaires by the year 2038
[10:25] Wa: lmao
[10:25] nexxy: Tobsn: that would kind of creep me out
[10:25] Tobsn: probably gonna try a couple days until one hooks

[10:31] Wa: Tobsn; might be timezone issues
[10:31] Tobsn: Wa, orly? ;)
[10:31] Tobsn: hehe
[10:31] Tobsn: i used strtotime() from phpjs
[10:32] Tobsn: looks like it doesnt handle %z

[10:32] Tobsn: timezone
[10:33] Wa: oh

[10:33] Tobsn: [ 3, 'May', 2011, 2, 35, 38, '-0700' ]
[10:33] Tobsn: is the sscanf result

[10:35] path[l] has joined the channel

[10:37] chjj: thats really hacky
[10:37] Tobsn: yep
[10:37] Wa: Tobsn; split that TZ string up into 1,2,2 chars then math it to seconds and sum it with the strtotime result
[10:37] chjj: why not just do getUTCFullYear, getUTC..., etc
[10:37] Tobsn: thats kinda the same result
[10:38] Tobsn: -0700
[10:38] Tobsn: Tue May  3 03:28:46 PDT 2011
[10:38] Tobsn: thats what i need
[10:38] chjj: oh, you want the timezone there?
[10:38] Wa: chjj; can't do that while setting :p
[10:38] Tobsn: Tue, 03 May 2011 09:35:38 GMT
[10:38] DeltachaosDeskto:  whoo. someone added me in icq.. and here is the joke: "it's not a russian bot"
[10:38] Tobsn: thats what JS gives me
[10:38] chjj: wa: what do you mean, all a Date object is, is a unix time wrapped in some api
[10:39] Wa: yeah but if the seconds he's setting aren't UTC it's not gonna work, and that's the problem atm right?
[10:39] seivan has joined the channel
[10:39] chjj: if you change the unix time to try to change the date objects timezone, youre effectively changing the real time underneath the surface
[10:39] Tobsn: cant i just set a general timezone for the date object?

[10:40] xeodox: Why can't I run app.js in port 80?
[10:40] Tobsn: xeodox, port too low

[10:45] Tobsn: times too early
[10:45] Tobsn: an hour
[10:45] Tobsn: weird?
[10:45] Wa: maybe it's just toString
[10:45] Wa: but the hour off is weird
[10:45] chjj: nerdfunk: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Modules - those arent necessarily recommended modules, but theres a good variety of them there
[10:45] Tobsn: yeah very
[10:45] nerdfunk: Thank you.
[10:45] Tobsn: its an hour to early for PDT
[10:46] nerdfunk: Just starting out in node and I'm thinking of writing up my experiences..
[10:46] Tobsn: Tue May 03 2011 02:35:38 GMT-0700 (PDT)
[10:46] Tobsn: toString()
[10:46] Tobsn: still an hour ear..
[10:46] konobi: toLocaleString ?
[10:46] Tobsn: nevermind
[10:46] Tobsn: its correct
[10:46] Wa: yeah looks better
[10:46] nerdfunk: Picking a module, and trying to do something cool/useful
[10:46] Wa: PDT vs. PST?
[10:46] Wa: :p
[10:46] Tobsn: im feeding it a static string where its 2:35
[10:46] Wa: ah
[10:46] Tobsn: :D
[10:47] Tobsn: now how do i feed that to mongo?
[10:47] azeroth_ has joined the channel
[10:47] Wa: mongo can accept date objects
[10:47] Tobsn: but i cant use .toString
[10:47] Wa: or..mongoose can at least
[10:48] Tobsn: or can i
[10:48] Tobsn: nah that makes no sense
[10:48] Wa: you can use .valueOf for the miliseconds but what would've been the point to putting it in a date object if you do? :p
[10:48] Tobsn: gonna try it
[10:48] Wa: or .UTC I guess is better
[10:49] Wa: idk
[10:49] Wa: oh no, that's set
[10:49] Wa: derp
[10:49] Tobsn: "t" : ISODate("2011-05-03T10:49:18Z")

[10:51] Tobsn: should i just insert that ISODate and call it a day?

[10:52] Wa: Tobsn; what do you want in the DB anyway?
[10:52] Wa: if you're gonna restore it as a date, miliseconds is probably better
[10:52] Tobsn: yeah... good question, i guess the timestamp is basically in the _id anyway
[10:53] konobi: Tobsn: depending on the DB, you might be able to cast it from something more sensible anyways
[10:53] Tobsn: like _id?

[11:11] Tobsn: to save them in a db? yes.
[11:11] Tobsn: oh really?
[11:11] Tobsn: when is it not 0 ;)
[11:11] Wa: yes
[11:11] Wa: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes
[11:11] Tobsn: yeah, no
[11:11] Tobsn: that doesnt count
[11:12] Wa: 226, 41x, 42x, 44x, 450, 510
[11:12] Tobsn: ive never seen a webserver spit out anything that has no 0 in the middle in over 10 years
[11:12] chjj: 416, requested range not satisfiable
[11:12] chjj: off the top of my head
[11:12] Tobsn: we used to rate chicks my http status codes...
[11:13] Wa: most of them may not be useful but I'd say 41x could be
[11:13] Tobsn: 412 Precondition Failed
[11:13] Tobsn: 415 Unsupported Media Type
[11:13] Wa: if you want to be so space saving, maybe remove the 0, but don't add it back if the code is already three chars
[11:13] Wa: but really, one byte isn't gonna do much
[11:14] Tobsn: true, its an int anyway
[11:14] Wa: yeah if it's an int it's not gonna save any space ;p
[11:14] Tobsn: what about referer
[11:14] Tobsn: could i save the first 4 chars ;)
[11:15] chjj: how?
[11:15] Tobsn: http is useless
[11:15] Tobsn: its always http
[11:15] chjj: youd be counting on all user agents sending absolute urls though
[11:15] Tobsn: and if not it starts with s
[11:15] chjj: and theres a ton of different user agents out there
[11:15] test1: anyone no of any updates to the crypto module recently?
[11:16] chjj: might even be a relative url
[11:16] test1: getting problems calling the update method
[11:16] Wa: Tobsn; the minor space you save isn't really worth it, imo
[11:16] test1: *know
[11:16] chjj: .//etc
[11:16] Tobsn: i wonder if i should just do a browser check and save the type and version instead of the full string
[11:16] chjj: yeah, 4 bytes isnt worth it
[11:16] Tobsn: Wa, ~20m req/day * 4 chars * 30 * 12
[11:16] chjj: considering the problems it may cause
[11:16] Wa: Tobsn; still less than a kb..
[11:17] Tobsn: hu?
[11:17] Wa: well maybe not with the 20m req/day thing
[11:17] Tobsn: 27gig
[11:17] Tobsn: saves quiet a bit in the next 12 month
[11:18] chjj: thats assuming that every request carries with it a referer header
[11:18] chjj: which it wont
[11:18] chjj: a lot of people/user agents have referers turned of or dont use them

[11:19] chjj: its a top level option on every browser except chrome
[11:19] chjj: dont need some obscure addon to do it, it comes baked into the browser as an option
[11:19] Tobsn: i have here around 6TB of logs laying around... trust me... people have everything full blast ;)
[11:20] chjj: in my logs i wish i saw more referers than i did
[11:20] chjj: lots of people have them turned off, to assume that every request will carry a referer is bad
[11:20] lukegalea has joined the channel
[11:20] Tobsn: if you target the avg. user which makes probably 99% of the net, they dont even know what a referer is little less how to change settings in a browser
[11:20] erose has joined the channel
[11:20] chjj: and then theres all the other agents that just dont send referers ever
[11:21] erose: yay gnome desktop

[11:21] Nexxy has joined the channel
[11:21] chjj: ie is not 80% marketshare anymore
[11:21] chjj: not by a long shot
[11:21] Tobsn: its not market share but its the dummy demographics
[11:21] Wa: Tobsn; there are firewalls that block referrers as well, so the user doesn't actually have to know what it is or even do anything
[11:22] chjj: there are also browser addons that will turn off referers
[11:22] mc_greeny1 has joined the channel

[11:24] Tobsn: broad over all users out there you have a lot of browsers, if you talk site specific and its a site a oprah fan would know youre pretty quickly in around 80-90% IE users

[11:24] JacobSingh: ah, finally... :) Feeling silly
[11:25] ExsysHost has joined the channel
[11:25] chjj: the common user uses other browsers besides ie, as evidenced by the fact that ie comes *pre-installed* on windows, and its now dropping below 50% marketshare, that means that people explicitly and consciously decided to download and install firefox or something else
[11:26] chjj: theres no way ie is used by all of the common users that may be on any given site
[11:26] Wa: unless it's an IE only site I guess
[11:26] Tobsn: believe it or not ;)
[11:26] Wa: but who makes those anymore..?
[11:26] Tobsn: just think about who clicks all those banners...
[11:27] chjj: think about how insane that is though, IE comes *with* the most popular operating system, and its now less than 50% marketshare
[11:27] mengxy has joined the channel

[11:29] Nexxy: quirks mode 4 lyfe
[11:30] chjj: certain flavors of quirks mode arent that bad
[11:30] Tobsn: i actually have to test for IE6
[11:30] Tobsn: which sucks
[11:30] Tobsn: balls
[11:30] Tobsn: a lot of them.
[11:31] chjj: the wrong box model quirks mode is the worst
[11:31] Nexxy: golf balls?
[11:31] chjj: but the other flavors that every other browser has for quirks arent so bad
[11:31] chjj: opera has a pretty bad one actually
[11:31] Nexxy: brb, nyan cat
[11:31] Wa: Tobsn; don't enable them!
[11:31] chjj: by FF, chrome, and ie7+, quirks mode isnt as bad as it seems
[11:31] chjj: but*
[11:31] neshaug has joined the channel
[11:32] Wa: IE6 users have a problem :(
[11:32] Tobsn: have to
[11:32] Nexxy: omg twitter's new front page is purdy
[11:32] Tobsn: i have to cover IE6,7,8,9 & FF3.0>4
[11:32] chjj: tobsn, thats painful
[11:33] Tobsn: yes
[11:33] Wa: the longer you support it the longer they won't feel the need to work on their issues
[11:33] Tobsn: its a huge pain in the ass
[11:33] chjj: i wish everyone would just leave ie6, 7, and 8 behind already
[11:33] Wa: ^
[11:33] Tobsn: but im doing html/css since 1997... so i kinda know a lot about the old browsers
[11:33] chjj: the only reason they survive is because people still support them :(

[11:33] Tobsn: btw. best guideline: dont give a shit about standards like w3
[11:34] Tobsn: div vs table? table. cause it always works.
[11:34] Tobsn: ;)
[11:34] chjj: uhm, not the best guideline, in fact, thats why IE is so bad in the first place
[11:34] chjj: because it made its own standards
[11:34] chjj: and it failed
[11:34] Nexxy: display: table-cell;
[11:34] Wa: not bad, just incompatible >_>;
[11:34] chjj: exactly, CSS has these capabilities
[11:34] Tobsn: it will just drive you nuts if you implement stuff and it will not look the same in a single browser and you have to make huge workarounds to get it working
[11:34] Wa: Nexxy; not cross-browser compatible
[11:35] Nexxy: ... and? ;3
[11:35] chjj: wa: you mean, not IE compatible
[11:35] chjj: which should be irrelevant
[11:35] Wa: pretty much
[11:35] Nexxy: god, nyan cat is amazing
[11:35] Tobsn: btw. the best invention in the last 14 years of web design i've seen is jquery...
[11:35] Tobsn: most amazing project ever.
[11:35] chjj: jquery != design
[11:35] Tobsn: thank god for those crazy people
[11:35] Tobsn: it just makes things easier
[11:37] Wa: wish we could just ditch html/css sometimes, all this dragging old shit along for compatibility is really annoying ><
[11:37] Wa: just make a sane system that actually has block based vertical centering and all that jazz :<
[11:37] chjj: i dont see how you could do without css or a box model
[11:38] chjj: there would be no context by which to position anything on the screen without css
[11:38] DeltachaosDeskto: what dose the cluster module? and how dose the http server scale?
[11:38] DeltachaosDeskto: oh falscher icr channle :D
[11:38] Wa: well I mean, it'd still be like xml, just with no attempt to be backwards compatible
[11:38] sourcode has joined the channel
[11:39] chjj: xml would be terrible, what are you talking about?
[11:39] Wa: and there would be styling, but preferably better or at least more robust than css
[11:39] chjj: they tried an xml based web, and it failed miserably
[11:39] Wa: like xhtml, better? :X
[11:39] chjj: xhtml is terrible
[11:39] Wa: I just mean in that tag-based style
[11:39] chjj: no incremental rendering === ultimate failure
[11:39] DeltachaosDeskto: and use node.js the advantages of multicores? threadring and so on?
[11:40] Wa: incremental rendering?
[11:40] chjj: yes
[11:40] Wa: html -> css -> screen ?
[11:40] chjj: any xml based language that actually has a rendering needs to be parsed completely before rendering
[11:40] chjj: html can be parsed gracefully
[11:40] tiagoa has joined the channel
[11:40] chjj: and render incrementally
[11:41] chjj: instead of in one big chunk
[11:41] chjj: like xhtml
[11:41] Wa: oh ok
[11:41] Nexxy: omg nyan cat has a hat on now
[11:41] chjj: its part of the reason
[11:41] chjj: you cant do document.write in xhtml
[11:41] chjj: (obviously shouldnt do document.write anyway)
[11:41] Wa: well I wasn't meaning to imply anything of that nature
[11:42] Wa: was only talking about syntax
[11:42] Tobsn: if( \b(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\b.test(chunk[0]) ) {
[11:42] Tobsn: anyone know why that throws a SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[11:42] chjj: what did you mean about syntax?
[11:42] Wa: cause you forgot /
[11:42] Wa: around the regex
[11:42] Tobsn: arg
[11:42] chjj: draconian parsing for html would also be really bad, 99% of pages on the web would render
[11:43] chjj: wouldnt*
[11:43] chjj: they would throw a parse error
[11:43] Tobsn: thx
[11:43] chjj: graceful error handling is really necessary for whatever language will fuel the web
[11:43] Wa: chjj; when I said what I did, I meant, the new thing would be like html, or just tag based, (no implication of incremental or non). The only difference being that the redesign wouldn't try to support older versions
[11:44] chjj: i see
[11:44] Wa: html and css are plagued with the problems of old versions due to compatibility attempts
[11:45] chjj: i dont see much worry for backward compatibility now in css, with the proposals for css variables and mixins
[11:45] Wa: yeah I guess they're kind of heading in that direction
[11:46] chjj: i think css variables might be a little overambitious tbh, i would be happy with just css constants
[11:46] Wa: but wtb "has child" selector and vertical centering for blocks
[11:46] Wa: yeah I've always wanted css constants; that's all I'd use them for :p
[11:46] chjj: flexbox will solve vertical centering
[11:46] brianloveswords has joined the channel
[11:47] Tobsn: does anyone know a module for node that gives you browser details? browser, version & platform
[11:47] chjj: has child is a bad way of going about solving the selector problem, because its not consistent with other selectors
[11:47] chjj: the :subject pseudo class that was proposed ages ago is a better way to go
[11:47] Wa: haven't heard subject
[11:47] sonnym has joined the channel
[11:47] chjj: its really unknown, but it was a great idea
[11:47] chjj: it was proposed in the early 2000s, but disregarded
[11:47] chjj: it allowed you to force the subject of a selector
[11:48] Wa: but the one I'm thinking of was aka "parent selector", essentially div < a or whatever, where essentially it's just like "affect the div that has a as a child"
[11:48] Wa: ahh
[11:48] Wa: that'd be cool, too
[11:48] chjj: parent selector would be alright, has-child is just really inconsistent though
[11:48] ardcore has joined the channel
[11:48] Wa: yeah I didn't mean that as literal
[11:48] fairwinds has joined the channel
[11:48] ardcore has left the channel
[11:48] chjj: ancestral selectors create problems though, because you have to interpret the selector from left to right instead of right to left
[11:49] Wa: I think it'd just be a better name than parent selector
[11:49] DeltachaosDeskto: does node support XMLHttpRequest?
[11:49] Charuru has joined the channel
[11:49] chjj: it can respond to xmlhttprequest
[11:49] Wa: DeltachaosDeskto; check out socket.io
[11:50] Tobsn: `3rdEden
[11:50] chjj: if you can parse a selector from right to left, its kind of like a filter thing, you get a big collection of possible elements that may be the final subjects of the selector, and you keep on reducing that collection as you move left
[11:50] Tobsn: http://chrisschuld.com/projects/browser-php-detecting-a-users-browser-from-php/ - you need to read the source and update your user agent script ;)
[11:50] chjj: really efficient, but ancestral selectors would change everything =(
[11:51] chjj: css has a lot of other problems though
[11:52] chjj: like not being able to explicitly specify an element's containing block
[11:52] chjj: which creates a really strong link between css and markup, which shouldnt be there
[11:53] awenkhh has joined the channel
[11:53] mdaisuke has joined the channel
[11:54] Wa: what do you mean?
[11:54] chjj: hard to explain
[11:55] chjj: when you position an element with css, its start context is its parent element
[11:55] beejeebus has joined the channel
[11:55] chjj: the context of its original position is always based on the markup
[11:55] chjj: or
[11:55] chjj: the computed DOM
[11:55] chjj: which is bad
[11:55] chjj: and wrong
[11:55] Wa: oh I see
[11:55] chjj: because then the markup is influencing the layout of a page
[11:56] chjj: you can just write your markup without thinking about the layout at all
[11:56] chjj: which you should be able to do
[11:56] Wa: well that seems kind of inherent, considering it's a tree
[11:56] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[11:56] tobiassjosten has joined the channel
[11:56] chjj: well it might be a good basis to start off with, but they should offer some kind of way of changing the containing block of an element
[11:57] chjj: which they dont
[11:57] chjj: in css
[11:57] chjj: hopefully xbl2 will solve that if it ever gets implemented
[11:57] chjj: but no one seems to care about it
[11:57] Wa: I've never even heard of it
[11:57] chjj: it allows you to construct a shadow DOM
[11:58] chjj: you can reorganize the DOM underneath the surface
[11:58] chjj: allowing you to position things, or add things
[11:58] Wa: sounds sexy
[11:58] chjj: without altering the real DOM
[11:58] chjj: it is
[11:58] chjj: very sexy
[11:58] chjj: but its not being implemented for some reason
[11:58] Wa: css seemed like it was kinda trying to do that with pseudo elements or whatever
[11:58] chjj: its been a TR for 4 years
[11:58] Wa: but very poorly
[11:59] chjj: yeah, pseudo elements are shadow DOM
[11:59] Wa: it needs a lot of work :S
[11:59] chjj: well, there was originally going to be a css3 generated content spec
[11:59] chjj: but it was dropped in favor of xbl2
[11:59] Wa: particularly some sort of ::outer and ::inner
[11:59] chjj: yeah, thats what they were going to add
[12:00] chjj: but it was dropped
[12:00] Wa: would be nice :(
[12:00] chjj: or gutted at the very least
[12:00] Wa: they need to stop dropping good ideas!
[12:00] chjj: hopefully
[12:00] chjj: they introduced a lot of problems
[12:00] chjj: xbl2 solves all those problems without introducing new ones
[12:00] chjj: so they dropped it
[12:00] Wa: I see
[12:01] \sega has joined the channel
[12:01] Wa: sounds like css is expecting xbl2 to be implemented, then?
[12:01] chjj: well xbl2 is separate from css
[12:01] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[12:01] chjj: xbl2 is a markup language
[12:02] chjj: but it will have a property for css
[12:02] chjj: you can do element { binding: url(mybinding.xbl#id); }
[12:02] chjj: to define behavior for an element
[12:03] chjj: theres a pure JS implementation right now actually
[12:03] chjj: saw it on google code
[12:03] chjj: fun to mess around with

[12:03] Tobsn: ;)
[12:04] xeodox has joined the channel
[12:04] Wa: no I know it's separate, I just mean, with css dropping the psuedo elements in favor of xbl2, it sounds like they're kind of expecting browsers to implement xbl2 as well as css3
[12:04] JacobSingh has joined the channel
[12:04] dnolen has joined the channel
[12:04] chjj: well they were, until nobody bothered implementing xbl
[12:04] Wa: sad :(
[12:05] chjj: the xbl2 spec was gutted a couple months ago
[12:05] chjj: to make it easier to implement
[12:05] chjj: so hopefully we see some implementations soon :(
[12:06] chjj: i think theres a branch of webkit that started implementing it or something
[12:06] chjj: not sure
[12:06] Wa: xbl2 sounds like a lot of what I'm missing, too. But it's slightly annoying that we fixed the problem by throwing another language in the mix
[12:06] chjj: well xbl fixes a lot of problems css has, but it also adds things that were just flat out missing
[12:07] Ob1kn00b has joined the channel
[12:07] chjj: like specifying the behavior of an element
[12:07] Wa: yeah
[12:07] Wa: maybe we should just flesh xbl2 out with some styling and drop css >_>
[12:07] chjj: well
[12:07] chjj: it uses css
[12:07] chjj: so cant do that
[12:07] Wa: :<
[12:08] chjj: actually it uses css selectors to select elements
[12:08] dyer has joined the channel
[12:08] Wa: there's just so much crap to web development as is
[12:08] chjj: despite css' shortcomings, i think css selectors are good
[12:08] Wa: definitely
[12:08] chjj: theyre nice and simple
[12:08] chjj: better than xpath
[12:08] Wa: I mean, it's missing a few selectors I'd like to have for sure, but the general concept is sexy
[12:09] Wa: and yeah much better than xpath :S

[12:28] ^kp: How did you find things like MVC, Il8n?
[12:28] stagas: jackbach: also the .delete method could go in Post
[12:28] ^kp: and were there extensions that you needed from php?
[12:29] jackbach: stagas, but deffinetly just one client? about delete, I'll do that thanks :)

[13:03] taf2: notice i restart the libev loop
[13:03] taf2: what's interesting about this is if I'm going to fork /exec this is wrong to restart the loop
[13:03] taf2: but if i'm just going to fork than this is right
[13:04] taf2: from the standpoint of "it's working"

[14:20] mikegerwitz: baudehlo: If your client is the only thing that holds a reference to the socket, and it is not accessible from any scope (causing it to be eventually GC'd), then your socket would also have to be GC'd because it's no longer accessible. If you have a reference to the socket anywhere outside of the client object, then that must also be cleared.
[14:21] baudehlo: right, but GC only clears the heap memory, it doesn't close the fd.

[15:04] bingomanatee: Nexxy -- one second.
[15:04] Nexxy: bertie, express automagically serves static files as long as it knows where they are
[15:04] EvanCarroll: I suppose it might just be that this package.json doesn't have the url of the repos.

[17:08] EvanCarroll: yes. I saw that.
[17:08] EvanCarroll: I just wanted to raise from the outset -- these two repos look confusingly similiar.
[17:09] EvanCarroll: jquery: http://search.npmjs.org/#/jquery. jquery-browserify: http://search.npmjs.org/#/jquery-browserify
[17:10] EvanCarroll: they're both by the same author, without homepages, or repo-links, and browserify 1.5.0 and 1.5.2, and jquery is 1.5.1 which makes them seem the same package. 
[17:10] EvanCarroll: but jquery-browserify has substantially more code.
[17:10] EvanCarroll: the descriptions are the same on both

[17:16] rauchg has joined the channel
[17:18] EvanCarroll: Ok, it seems as if npm package 'jquery' -- which John does not have a github repo for, comes from https://github.com/coolaj86/node-jquery/blob/master/package.json
[17:18] EvanCarroll: but yet John published it to npm
[17:19] eee_c1 has joined the channel
[17:19] EvanCarroll: also confusingly, AJ O'neil has the author of node-jquery ('jquery') on npm set to John Resig, which isn't the npm author but the author of the vanilla jquery
[17:19] saschagehlich: tjholowaychuk: will you apply the prettyprint patch? looks like some people really want this and jb55 managed to rebase it

[17:20] isaacs: EvanCarroll: sounds like something to take up with AJ and John?

[17:23] abraham has joined the channel
[17:23] isaacs: you can publish whatever you want.  it requires email validation to reset your account, though
[17:23] EvanCarroll: I don't think jresig even had anything *at all* to dow ith jquery or jquery-browserify, I see no evidence of it. It just seems as if someone else put him down as the author.
[17:23] isaacs: EvanCarroll: what's `npm owner ls jquery` report?
[17:23] isaacs: the "author" field is irrelevant.  it's just for giving kudos

[17:47] mikey_p: Postmodernist: https://github.com/senchalabs/connect, or just use express which relies on connect
[17:47] EvanCarroll: turns out there was a README inside of the tarbal, that links `jquery` on npm to node-jquery
[17:47] EvanCarroll: duncanbeevers: cpan provides the function for an author to remove the module

[17:51] EvanCarroll: the deal is that authors shouldn't be allowed to publish modules (to npm anyway) if the name/description or repository urls collide with other modules, and if they do it's hard to battle the ambiguitity because there is no manifest accessible from the web interface, you don't have access to the readme, and you can't see the author meta information about who published it, and the dates behind each version.

[17:53] EvanCarroll: CPAN is roughly 150k years old in internet time.
[17:53] sivy has joined the channel
[17:54] EvanCarroll: but npm should learn more from it, if node.js is to go down the route of the centralized repo system -- I'm not ready to throw my hat in yet on nodules, I'd like to work on that concept, it seems technically superior.

[19:01] coreb has joined the channel
[19:02] baudehlo: tjholowaychuk: but it does raise an issue which I think is a bug. If you let a filehandle go out of scope, when it is garbage collected something closes the file (same for sockets)... If you do the same with a pipe (from netBinding.pipe()) it doesn't get closed when it's gc'd.

[19:12] bingomanatee: tjholowaychuk: I'm rebranding my MVC knockoff "Nuby on Node"
[19:12] tjholowaychuk: haha
[19:12] tjholowaychuk: newbie on node
[19:12] tjholowaychuk: jk
[19:12] bingomanatee: Not perfectly a parrallel in that node is closer to Ruby than Rails. 
[19:12] baudehlo: I wish node had man pages.
[19:12] bingomanatee: But Nuby (umlats on the u) makes for a good logo
[19:12] baudehlo: I'd love to be able to type: man node.fs and get docs for fs.js
[19:12] lukstr: doesn't it? I thought they were just terrible
[19:13] bingomanatee: we have a wikia. If you want to annotate the documentation, go there. 
[19:13] lukstr: baudehlo: ah. doable, but I doubt anyone will volunteer :)
[19:13] brianloveswords has joined the channel
[19:13] CiRlE has joined the channel
[19:13] baudehlo: lukstr: should be easy really. There must be a markdown to man page or nroff somewhere
[19:14] bingomanatee: I think the nodejs.org website docs are complete in an of themselves. 
[19:14] baudehlo: do you mean incomplete?
[19:14] bingomanatee: No I dont. 
[19:14] baudehlo: oh. They are incomplete too :)
[19:14] bingomanatee: They are not verbose and thorough but the basic structure is there. 
[19:15] baudehlo: there's stuff that exists that they don't document.
[19:15] xeodox has joined the channel
[19:15] bingomanatee: Feel free to annotate up the Wikia or throw questions up there. 
[19:15] bingomanatee: For instance?
[19:15] baudehlo: bingomanatee: I think rather than annotate I should just edit them on github.
[19:16] baudehlo: e.g. fs.fsync() and fs.fsyncSync()
[19:16] xeodox_ has joined the channel
[19:16] bingomanatee: Knock yourself out. I didn't know they were git'd. 
[19:16] djcoin has joined the channel
[19:16] lukstr: baudehlo: I concur, I've watched some new users struggle greatly with the docs
[19:17] bingomanatee: Well part of the problem is that a lot of good stuff evaporates on the channel. When I get NuBY done I'll revisit Noogle and give that a more formal showcase. That might help.

[19:18] baudehlo: to break out of that and go to a web browser is a huge PITA.
[19:18] bingomanatee: Part of what made the PHP documentation stellar is the commentary was recycled into the documentation. We can't do that on nodejs.org.

[19:21] baudehlo: mikegerwitz: I'd also love it for the core JS stuff.
[19:21] baudehlo: so to have "man node.fs" work as well as "man js.Object" work... I'd be in heaven.
[19:21] mikegerwitz: baudehlo: Absolutely :)
[19:21] baudehlo: I'm sure this isn't that hard.
[19:22] mikegerwitz: baudehlo: not at all. Just tedious and time consuming.
[19:22] baudehlo: hell, even if I just parsed to pod and ran pod2man (which is pretty much everywhere).

[19:28] mikegerwitz: http://rtomayko.github.com/ronn/ronn.1.html
[19:28] mikegerwitz: too bad it's in ruby
[19:28] tjholowaychuk: there is a ronnjs
[19:29] tjholowaychuk: but it's really bad
[19:29] a|i: I like the fact that node people don't like ruby :)
[19:30] baudehlo: mikegerwitz: I looked but it says this: Ronn is written in Ruby and depends on hpricot and rdiscount, extension libraries that are non-trivial to install on some systems.
[19:30] baudehlo: I kinda want something that is one script that works on most unixes out of the box.
[19:30] baudehlo: pretty much everyone has perl (and thus perldoc, which displays pod pages).

[19:43] coreb has joined the channel
[19:43] wink_: baudehlo: the idea of an easily hackable smtp server is pretty badass, is there some documentation on the plugin system?  one plugin i want is the ability to deliver mail similar to the extended addresses, except have the last 'word' be a counter where the address will expire and become undeliverable once a certain number of mails have been sent there
[19:44] wink_: so wink.spamsite.4@domain.com would allow 4 mails to that address before bouncing them
[19:44] chjj: let me put it to you this way: if eazy-e were still alive, he would use node.js
[19:45] baudehlo: wink_: as usual the best way is reading other examples... but the docs are in the docs/ dir.
[19:45] baudehlo: it's mostly api docs. I need to write a tutorial.

[20:12] a2800276 has joined the channel
[20:12] baudehlo: wink_: right. Though you might want to store the count in a DB.
[20:12] pyrotechnick1: lua is a strange choice to me but watever
[20:12] baudehlo: in case of restart
[20:12] tjholowaychuk: LowValueTarget: no it uses the new progressive header api so it doesnt set the status code
[20:13] tjholowaychuk: but 200 is the default anyway
[20:13] tjholowaychuk: LowValueTarget: res.statusCode = n
[20:13] tjholowaychuk: pyrotechnick1: I think it's perfect

[20:14] tjholowaychuk: chjj: agreed
[20:14] pyrotechnick1: there needs to be a solid mechanism for managing these extensions

[20:27] mendel__: ;)
[20:27] tjholowaychuk: since his code there wasn't using any express stuff really
[20:28] bingomanatee: Hey TJ  I have kind of a wierd question - say you want to bind a function which IS a module ("controllers/actions/show") to a property of ANOTHER module ("admin") then set that as a route (var admin = require('controllers/admin'); app.get('app/:id.html', admin.show)) - can you do it or will show always retain the "this" ness from its original module context?

[20:31] ckknight: wink_: I did work for Curse, Inc. Their development office was moved out here from San Francisco. They shipped me out. Truth be told, had they not done that, I'd've found a better job and left them far sooner.
[20:31] tjholowaychuk: res.sendfile() ends for you
[20:31] tjholowaychuk: because you wouldnt be sending a file and then more bytes after
[20:32] tjholowaychuk: unless you wanted to fuck up your file
[20:32] LowValueTarget: ah... thanks. I can jump off the failboat now
[20:32] ckknight: mendel__: but I don't speak Dutch
[20:32] bingomanatee: okay - simpler question - what is the way to bind in node such that function foo is treated as a member of bar

[20:32] springmeyer_ has joined the channel
[20:32] ckknight: says you!
[20:32] gonsfx: are there any other things in connect req object that could possibly be changed when proxying to node through apache/nginx/squid besides req.headers.host and req.socket.remoteAddress?

[20:33] bingomanatee: yeah. 
[20:33] taf2: that's not node.js that's javascript :P
[20:33] wink_: ckknight: out in anderson hills?  i was down there last week and seeing the video is pretty crazy
[20:33] pyrotechnick1: =>
[20:33] ckknight: wink_: up in Harvest.
[20:33] mendel__: what do you guys think about my new domain: http://bind.io
[20:33] wink_: yeah, they got hammered
[20:33] dlkinney has joined the channel
[20:33] mendel__: :D
[20:33] ckknight: mendel__: nice
[20:34] taf2: damn you and your clever domains
[20:34] bingomanatee: so if I want to call function foo in he context of module bar, its foo.bind(bar)(arg1, arg2, arg3)>
[20:34] bingomanatee: ?
[20:35] ckknight: bingomanatee: oh dear, no
[20:35] mikegerwitz: bingomanatee: foo.call( bar, arg1... );
[20:35] taf2: yeah... might use call
[20:35] taf2: or apply
[20:35] ckknight: yes, call or apply
[20:35] taf2: use bind if you're passing it
[20:35] bingomanatee: okay
[20:35] ckknight: or use bind if you're storing it somewhere
[20:35] malkomalko: tjholowaychuk: you around? not having any luck with cluster and multi env's trying to set different ports
[20:35] malkomalko: it's just always taking the port of my development
[20:35] taf2: function(foo) { foo(a,b); }(function(x,y) {}.bind(this));
[20:35] ckknight: like var cachedFunc = foo.bind(bar); cachedFunc(arg1)
[20:35] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: hmm lets see the config
[20:35] bingomanatee: so foo.bind(bar) returns a function with bar as its "this" value?
[20:35] pyrotechnick1: mendel__: damn this makes me want to go there now
[20:35] malkomalko: it's the same one from your env.js example
[20:36] taf2: correct
[20:36] bingomanatee: thanks
[20:36] malkomalko: but with 'app' instead of app
[20:36] mendel__: pyrotechnick1: you've read the article?
[20:36] malkomalko: and a test env instead of production
[20:36] pyrotechnick1: how the fuck do i get my username back? i've authed with nickserv but i still cant change my nick it says it's in use i dont get it
[20:36] taf2: bingomanatee, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind  if you ever need it in the browser too
[20:36] malkomalko: sorry, I lied, it sets the socket path for each env, but that's it
[20:37] wink_: pyrotechnick1: on slashnet you have to release it first
[20:37] bingomanatee: thanks.

[20:37] aho has joined the channel
[20:37] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: hmm :s
[20:37] bingomanatee: so is it foo.bind or $foo->bind() ? :)
[20:37] ckknight: bingomanatee: $foo->bind() is PHP, not Javascript
[20:37] bingomanatee: I know I'm yanking your chain
[20:38] malkomalko: no worries I gues
[20:38] malkomalko: I'll just have one listen(port) block with the port being a variable
[20:39] mscdex: pyrotechnick1: you can use the RECOVER nickserv command if you own the nick
[20:39] taf2: anyone written a node.js proc that handles log rotation? 
[20:39] mikegerwitz: taf2: what's wrong with logrotate? ;)

[20:42] mendel__: TooTallNate: our node-ios hero! Are you planning on further develop that? 
[20:42] bingomanatee: I would suggest looking at the presenters of the last node.js meetup - the game comppany at the end seemed pretty invested in node.

[20:46] gonsfx: on a sidenote - whats the difference between req.socket.remoteAddress, req.connection.remoteAddress and req.client.remoteAdress and .remotePort? :)

[20:46] gonsfx: why the duplicity?
[20:47] pyrotechnick: cool it's been ported to coffeescript https://github.com/madrobby/vapor.js/blob/master/ports/vapor.coffee
[20:47] mscdex: gonsfx: probably backwards compatibility, plus socket is less wordy
[20:47] tjholowaychuk: pyrotechnick: haha
[20:47] tjholowaychuk: wow
[20:47] tjholowaychuk: shows the true potential of coffeescript
[20:47] tjholowaychuk: dont even need to compile that one
[20:48] gonsfx: meh. so i'd rather replace all of them by the contents of req.headers.x-forwarded-for when proxying just in case client or connection are used instead of socket.
[20:48] wink_: i just ported it to pdp asm
[20:48] pyrotechnick: id compile it just incase
[20:48] TooTallNate: wtf? https://github.com/madrobby/vapor.js/commit/329d172c92b62bd8305746be148d7599907f8c84

[21:18] tjholowaychuk: app.match.all('/users/12') for example
[21:18] bingomanatee: yeah when you call app.get(..) which variable recieves the path/function pair?
[21:18] tjholowaychuk: app.get() and friends match by route path and .match() test the regexps to see if the given url matches
[21:19] bingomanatee: right.

[21:48] tjholowaychuk: ahahaha
[21:49] tauren: i agree, and I don't necessarily think that even a "slow" template engine will really seem that slow.
[21:49] cleanah: tauren : http://blog.nodejitsu.com/micro-templates-are-dead
[21:50] tauren: I'm more trying to understand why jade and other seems to be so popular. do they have useful features?
[21:50] tjholowaychuk: there are cases
[21:50] tjholowaychuk: but hell you better not be using a template engine for those cases
[21:51] tauren: i really hate embedding code, ANY CODE inside a template. this includes for(), each, etc. But most of them do this and the ones that don't (like pure) seem slow.
[21:51] baudehlo: if I were you I'd pick a template engine that is known to be robust against XSS. That would be my only criteria.
[21:53] tjholowaychuk: tauren: so your template will do absolutely nothing?
[21:53] tjholowaychuk: sounds useful :p
[21:53] chjj: tauren: i completely agree, templates should be as declarative as possible
[21:53] onar has joined the channel
[21:53] chjj: tj: i think its good to keep code out of templates to a degree
[21:54] tjholowaychuk: to a degree yeah
[21:54] chjj: especially just raw JS
[21:54] tauren: tjholowaychuk: actually, it is useful. by keeping logic out of the template, it keeps things separated.
[21:54] chjj: otherwise whats the point of a template
[21:54] tjholowaychuk: but template related logic, belongs in the template
[21:55] chjj: yeah, in my mind the point of a template is to separate code from what is actually output
[21:55] tjholowaychuk: everyone has different opinions, hence the variety of engines
[21:55] tjholowaychuk: yeah but with html
[21:55] tjholowaychuk: that is a clusterfuck anyway
[21:55] tjholowaychuk: data attrs n shit
[21:55] tjholowaychuk: js to perform things that css shoudl be doing
[21:55] tjholowaychuk: its all retarded anywy
[21:55] dambalah has left the channel
[21:55] tauren: cleanah: great link!
[21:56] chjj: im working on my own little templating engine, it has a foreach, interpolation, and a special little conditional notation, but thats it, no raw js
[21:56] tjholowaychuk: so it's mustache?
[21:56] chjj: i hope not, never used mustache
[21:57] tmpvar has joined the channel
[21:57] chjj: but those 3 things are all i need, i dont like having code in the template

[21:58] chjj: maybe less
[21:58] tjholowaychuk: depends on the implementation
[21:58] tjholowaychuk: mustache.js is lame
[21:58] tjholowaychuk: it shouldnt be more than a few hundred

[22:03] tbranyen: its whatever you want it to be
[22:03] tjholowaychuk: chjj: i didnt mean that i mean the state of web apps is still not close enough to actually separating design from logic
[22:03] tjholowaychuk: still tons of shit needs js
[22:03] tjholowaychuk: html has stupid data attrs
[22:03] tjholowaychuk: etc
[22:03] chjj: yeah, those data attributes are rough
[22:03] chjj: =/
[22:04] tjholowaychuk: it's pretty tough to actually decouple those components
[22:04] chjj: your absolutely right though, markup and css are too closely linked still

[22:18] dhasenan has joined the channel
[22:18] bingomanatee: BHSPitRemote: you really need to forget about design patterns and just learn javascript
[22:18] mraleph: v8 does not call any weak callbacks when it shuts down
[22:18] BHSPitRemote: Here's my question: http://pastie.org/1862153
[22:18] fakewaffle: TheLifelessOne: http://nodejs.org/, http://www.nodebeginner.org/
[22:18] TheLifelessOne: fakewaffle: thanks!
[22:18] mraleph: so any object that relies on weak callbacks to manage it's own lifetime will not be destroyed. 
[22:19] djazz has left the channel
[22:19] christkv: @mraleph how do you force gc
[22:19] fakewaffle: TheLifelessOne: nodejs.org has one right on the front page there, and nodebeginner.org is good intro
[22:19] bingomanatee: BitWidget - remove function from line 21
[22:19] BHSPitRemote: bingomanatee: the biggest thing that gets me still (and is at the heart of the paste I just linked) is understanding all the different ways available for defining a "class", and when/why they are appropriate
[22:19] mraleph: christkv:  one way is to pass —expose-gc and use global gc() function
[22:19] AntelopeSalad: tj: is there any real difference in performance from embedding your routes in your app.js file compared to putting them into a separate module and requiring them?
[22:20] broofa has joined the channel
[22:20] bingomanatee: the basic problem for converts is that there is no use of the word clasc.
[22:20] bingomanatee: class.
[22:20] tjholowaychuk: AntelopeSalad: no lol not at all
[22:20] tjholowaychuk: sure it would take a fraction of a second longer to boot
[22:20] bingomanatee: JS classes are just functions on steroids.
[22:20] chjj: antelopesalad: it might cost an extra 1/10th a millisecond at startup
[22:20] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[22:20] tjholowaychuk: haha
[22:20] AntelopeSalad: effectively nothing then
[22:20] bingomanatee: Define a function, then modify its prototoype property and you are done. 
[22:20] tjholowaychuk: we have thousands and thousands of files
[22:20] tjholowaychuk: in our app
[22:21] tjholowaychuk: and it still boots in less than a second
[22:21] BHSPitRemote: bingomanatee: if I remove "function" from that line, it becomes a syntax error
[22:21] chjj: yeah, antelope: the worst thing i ever did was underestimate how fast v8 is
[22:21] AntelopeSalad: what is the average page load time?
[22:21] chjj: ;)
[22:21] BHSPitRemote: bingomanatee: the code provided works as expected, but I'm wondering if it's a mess or not
[22:21] bingomanatee: well it is 
[22:21] mraleph: christkv: also before doing gc you obviously need to ensure that there are no references to this objects
[22:21] BHSPitRemote: (or if it looks pretty standard)
[22:21] tim_smart: isaacs: ping
[22:21] christkv: @member:mraleph that dropped the amount of lost memory
[22:22] bingomanatee: you need to define Widget as function Widget() {}

[22:22] xeodox: What's the best way to log my users' activites? (logged in users)
[22:22] mraleph: christkv: well some of this objects can be still reachable through JS heap so V8 still does not call weak callbacks
[22:22] BHSPitRemote: bingomanatee: care to fork my paste real quick and show me what you mean?
[22:22] xeodox: Should I write each page they view into mongo, as a document?
[22:23] BHSPitRemote: that sounded somewhat dirty.
[22:23] christkv: @mraleph so I should not worry is that your opinion ?
[22:23] christkv: @mraleph or should I do a longrunning test instead

[22:25] bingomanatee: http://pastie.org/1862174
[22:25] bingomanatee: is the basic class defintion. 
[22:25] isaacs: tim_smart: yo
[22:26] isaacs: ACTION has high latency this week
[22:27] bingomanatee: the previous {} style is essentially the signature of a singleton - a single object that is assembled, but not a function that can be instantiated as an object. 
[22:27] tim_smart: isaacs: Pretty good latency from this machine...

[22:29] else- has joined the channel
[22:29] bingomanatee: you want static methods? 
[22:29] BHSPitRemote: bingomanatee: in my example, you could say Widget.types[2], without having any widget objects made
[22:29] BHSPitRemote: bingomanatee: bingo.
[22:29] BHSPitRemote: (manatee)
[22:29] BHSPitRemote: oh, and I'm specifically targeting the Node.JS module format
[22:30] xeodox: How do I check what page the current user just loaded? Let's say someone went to "/user/alex", how can I use Express to get "/user/alex"?
[22:30] estrathmeyer has joined the channel
[22:30] bingomanatee: Okay
[22:30] xeodox: The request header
[22:31] isaacs: tim_smart: nopt treats anything without a -- as either a positional arg or a value
[22:31] bingomanatee: You can define a module with static functions and properties
[22:31] isaacs: you could look at the conf.argv member
[22:31] tjholowaychuk: xeodox: i dont get it
[22:31] bingomanatee: And you can define a class and make it instantiable
[22:31] christkv: @mraleph so is this something I care about. I'm the author of the mongodb driver so obviously a long running db driver leaking memory would suck :(
[22:31] tjholowaychuk: xeodox: app.get('/user/:name', callback)
[22:31] tjholowaychuk: xeodox: req.url ?
[22:31] tjholowaychuk: i dunno
[22:31] tjholowaychuk: lol
[22:31] tjholowaychuk: not sure what you mean
[22:31] bingomanatee: so you can have module.exports = {Widget: function () {} ... types: [] }
[22:32] bingomanatee: and then in the module you can add methods as in 
[22:32] BHSPitRemote: bingomanatee: to make things even more needlessly complicated, I'm actually aiming to make modules that are also includable in a web browser
[22:32] xeodox: tjholowaychuk: I'm writting a middleware that is shared among all controllers. I just want this middleware to console.log( req. path )
[22:32] Nexxy: fakewaffle, I am now!
[22:32] tjholowaychuk: xeodox: req.url then
[22:32] bingomanatee: module.exprts.Widget.prototype.foo = function(){} ...
[22:32] BHSPitRemote: bingomanatee: (my original pastie actually does this, with an extra incantation at the end)
[22:32] tjholowaychuk: than? then?

[22:33] tjholowaychuk: full of ambiguity

[22:33] tjholowaychuk: BHSPitRemote: nope
[22:33] BHSPitRemote: foiled!
[22:33] tjholowaychuk: BHSPitRemote: Buffer support would be better
[22:33] tjholowaychuk: but nope
[22:34] tim_smart: isaacs: Alirght, I'll just hack around the remaining args or something/
[22:34] BHSPitRemote: "Nope!"
[22:34] Nexxy: tjholowaychuk, let's start an initiative to convert everyone to lojban
[22:34] tjholowaychuk: Nexxy: haha :D
[22:34] isaacs: tim_smart: or just do what npm does, and route based on them.  the common pattern is for non --prefixed args to be "commands" and --foo to be a "flag"
[22:34] Nexxy: no srsly!
[22:34] isaacs: tim_smart: in npm, i route based on argv.remain[0]
[22:34] Nexxy: predicate logic!!
[22:35] tjholowaychuk: thats why i get mad when people try to make programming more like english
[22:35] tjholowaychuk: english sucks
[22:35] BHSPitRemote: "Do you serve cake here?" "Even better: souffle! But no, we serve neither of those things."
[22:35] BHSPitRemote: -- tjholowaychuk 
[22:35] Nexxy: if anything people should make programing more like japanese
[22:35] bingomanatee: http://pastie.org/1862211 is at least the beginning of a dual purpose class
[22:36] bingomanatee: you can expose Widgets to node using module.exports and put widget and all your static functions in it, and the Widget_module will be exposed to client side Javascript. 
[22:36] tim_smart: isaacs: Sound good. I was going to have the 'command' optional, but for simplicities sake I'll flag that.
[22:36] tim_smart: *simplicity's
[22:37] bingomanatee: I'm sure there are less clumsy ways of doing this but this would work. 
[22:37] tim_smart: isaacs: I used nopt for http://github.com/Tim-Smart/gista , works well!
[22:37] BHSPitRemote: bingomanatee: thanks for the insight

[23:16] christkv: @member:mraleph running an empty node script with forces gc looses 200 blocks according to valgrind
[23:16] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: im implementing it for error reporting instead of growl haha
[23:16] christkv: @member:mraleph I'm assuming the losses I'm seeing is happening in node.js
[23:16] tjholowaychuk: now blind people can program
[23:16] a|i: is there a helper function for copying a file, or do I have to use createReadStream, createWriteStream et al?

[23:31] perlmonkey2: Buildling node on an amazon micro instance is a bit painful.
[23:31] galaxywatcher has joined the channel
[23:32] chjj: is it? ive been wondering whether to try amazon
[23:32] monokrome: perlmonkey2: It depends on your AMI.
[23:33] trotter has joined the channel
[23:33] monokrome: or do you simply mean due to compile time?
[23:34] perlmonkey2: chjj: I've had no problems with ec2 at all. But the micro instance definitely doesn't come with any horsepower when doing a build.
[23:34] okuryu has joined the channel
[23:34] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: ever actually use the os x accessibility stuff to write code?
[23:34] copongcopong has joined the channel
[23:34] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: yeah haha
[23:34] perlmonkey2: monokrome: right, just during a build. a micro instance is plenty when your webserver only uses 2KB per connection :P
[23:34] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: I had some ruby stuff that would write code for me with the voice recognition thing
[23:35] tjholowaychuk: and navigate around my app
[23:35] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: the terminal's pretty painful.  but it's impressively comprehensive for doing random nagivation and stuff.
[23:35] tjholowaychuk: it was pretty lame but hey
[23:35] tjholowaychuk: i think i have it built in commander actually

[23:39] aaronblohowiak: perlmonkey2: i have an 11" macbook air, which is both smaller and more capable than that setup
[23:39] aaronblohowiak: (for most combinations of keyboards and stands to hold the tablet)
[23:40] aaronblohowiak: the motorolla atrix 4g is interesting, though
[23:40] mbrevoort has joined the channel
[23:41] rworth has joined the channel
[23:42] perlmonkey2: aaronblohowiak: but I'm looking for an excuse to get a tablet. And the nook (with cyanogenmod) is great. Cheap enough I won't have to protect it and guard it with my life. Makes a great ereader/tablet. And if I want to dev I could whip out a keyboard and write some code while at the coffee shop.
[23:42] CiRlE has joined the channel
[23:42] aaronblohowiak: perlmonkey2: i'd wait for the color kindle to drive the nook price down
[23:43] perlmonkey2: aaronblohowiak: isn't that looking to be this fall?
[23:43] aaronblohowiak: perlmonkey2: you are looking for an excuse ^.^
