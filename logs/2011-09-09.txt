[01:26] jmoiron: what's the standard way of having a handler depend on two separate events?
[01:26] Nuck: jmoiron: Create a function, set it to a variable or name it, pass it to two event bindings
[01:27] mrryanjohnston: anyone here really familiar with vows?
[01:27] jmoiron: Nuck: won't that just call the function twice
[01:27] Nexxy: I don't think there is a "standard"
[01:27] mrryanjohnston: I'm trying to run `node gametest.js --spec` but it's not showing me the nice little checkmarks like it does on the vow's site :(
[01:27] mrryanjohnston: just âœ“ OK Â» 2 honored (0.002s)
[01:27] jmoiron: that's not what i want;  i want something to run only when two async events have been received
[01:27] Nexxy: jmoiron, you want it to listen for multiple events?
[01:28] jeninto: jmoiron - try a third function that runs on an interval that will check to see if both conditions have been met? and if they are run the function that you would want to execute?
[01:28] jmoiron: yeah, n-events;  so say i want to connect to 3 different resources, and then start some process after those connections are established
[01:28] Nuck: Ah, waiting for two events
[01:28] Nexxy: jmoiron, is that something async could help with?
[01:28] jmoiron: but then that's just polling
[01:28] Vertice has joined the channel

[01:30] jmoiron: https://github.com/caolan/async#parallel  that looks about right, cool;  thanks :)
[01:30] Vertice: i found a nifty way to do stuff like that using only underscore

[01:32] mrryanjohnston: nevermind, got it
[01:32] Nuck: async.js is pretty lightweight
[01:32] aragorn has joined the channel
[01:32] Nuck: I use it for the async forEach and such mostly
[01:32] Nuck: Helps protect against nesting

[01:40] Vertice: i was actually very pleased with it
[01:40] Nuck: WTF kind of Android has Microsoft in it?

[01:43] Nuck: Lion sounds like shit though
[01:43] Vertice: really, you like having to re-encode any video you put on it ?
[01:43] garann: anyone know why i might be getting a "domain not found" error trying to authenticate to the github v3 api?
[01:43] Vertice: lest you have any video not sanctioned by quicktime and stored in itunes
[01:43] Nuck: Vertice: Honestly, if it's not in MPEG-4, there's an issue
[01:44] Nuck: Or even in a format iPhone supports for a <video> tag
[01:44] Nuck: There's plenty of formats iOS supports, and I think it's understandable that they don't support old, shitty video formats.
[01:44] Nuck: I'd pick MP4 over AVI or WMV any day

[02:13] mrryanjohnston: node guys
[02:13] mrryanjohnston: though I guess good could be applied, too
[02:13] Nuck: Sublime Text 2 is great for on Windows, because it's a Mac app that has a Windows version
[02:13] Nuck: Which is like, fucking sexy.

[02:14] Nuck: I do yearn for textmate
[02:14] Nuck: OMGOMGOMGOMG
[02:14] chjj: no wonder nuck likes macs, he wants a giant iphone on his desk
[02:14] Nuck: SUBLIME TEXT WORKS ON LINUX
[02:14] Nuck: ACTION squees
[02:14] Sorella: hm, apparently it's written in C. I could swear it was written in Genie/Vala. Perhaps I'm just confounding it with something else.
[02:14] Nuck: chjj: I like my computer to make love to my face.
[02:14] chjj: my computer does that
[02:15] Nuck: I want a Mac because it's beautiful and usable
[02:15] Sorella: Linux is also beautiful and usable.
[02:15] Nuck: It surrounds me in good designs, which in turn makes me want to make good designs
[02:15] Sorella: usually more usable than beautiful.
[02:15] Nuck: Sorella: bahahahaha nice joke
[02:15] Nuck: I almost thought you were serious
[02:15] Sorella: ACTION is.
[02:15] jmoiron: I use both but I'm more comfortable in linux
[02:15] Nuck: Then I saw you say "usable" and I realized you were trolling.

[02:17] aaronblohowiak: :D thanks, nexxy
[02:17] Nuck: That's the catch with Linux.  To make it more usable you sacrifice beauty but to make it more beautiful you sacrifice usability.
[02:17] Nexxy: lol Nuck 
[02:17] Nexxy: features and eye candy are not diametrically opposed
[02:17] Lorentz: Sorella: pffffft how the hell is enlightenment not usable
[02:17] Nexxy: I'm not sure where you got that notion
[02:17] Nexxy: but it's sorely misinformed
[02:17] Sorella: Lorentz, the tiling module is buggy as hell.
[02:18] Nuck: Nexxy: Nobody in the Linux community seems to accept that they aren't though
[02:18] Nexxy: blue-tile + gnome is great IMHO
[02:18] Lorentz: That's assuming enlightenment is a tiling wm
[02:18] Sorella: the systray doesn't work, because raster keeps complaining about the specs (or lack thereof)
[02:18] Sorella: and other stuff.
[02:18] Nuck: You have to pick between one or the other when you pick your WM and whatnot
[02:18] Sorella: Lorentz, nope :3
[02:18] Nexxy: Nuck, I think you're mistaking the Linux community's lack of care
[02:18] Sorella: It's a good WM though, albeit still alpha.
[02:18] Nuck: Nexxy: I know they don't care
[02:18] Nuck: That's the problem
[02:18] chjj: dont care?
[02:18] Nexxy: I mean compiz/beryl
[02:19] RyanW: I used Enlightenment back in the 90s
[02:19] Nexxy: are purrrdy
[02:19] Nuck: Linux users seem not to care that they've got either beauty or usability.
[02:19] Nexxy: desktop cube anyone?
[02:19] Nuck: Nexxy: I agree, they are purdy.
[02:19] chrisdickinson: i just like the construction of apple laptops, personally. linux vs osx is kind of a lesser deal for me.

[02:19] jmoiron: chrisdickinson: i agree, though i still have a preference
[02:19] mrryanjohnston: just curious
[02:19] Nexxy: mrryanjohnston, come on don't pretend you didn't play with it for like 4 minutes
[02:19] Lorentz: I knew a guy who loves the cube
[02:19] mrryanjohnston: Nexxy: honestly I didn't :x
[02:19] secoif: hey when I'm using `spawn`, I'm having trouble using a command passing a path like: /test/* 
[02:19] Nexxy: pfffff
[02:19] mrryanjohnston: Nexxy: does that make me a bad person
[02:19] Nuck: Problem with Linux is that they allowed programmers to do UI designs.
[02:19] Nexxy: maybe ;3
[02:19] chrisdickinson: they both work -- and work well -- i just don't want to go back to the dark, dark days of owning a mid-2004 dell inspiron
[02:19] Nuck: That's like, a crime.
[02:19] mrryanjohnston: Nexxy: heh
[02:19] secoif: the * gets passed literally
[02:19] Nexxy: Nuck, freedom is never a crime
[02:20] Sorella: mrryanjohnston, what do you mean by "running". I'm running plenty of things.
[02:20] mrryanjohnston: Nexxy: I was starting in on tiling wms. So >:)

[02:20] mrryanjohnston: Sorella: distribution, wm, terminal of choice

[02:21] Nexxy: I use byobu
[02:21] Nexxy: that's it.
[02:21] Nuck: There's a difference between a designer/developer and a developer who tries to design but sucks massively at it
[02:21] RyanW: byobu rocks. I had my own insane screenrc before that came out

[02:24] mrryanjohnston: nice
[02:24] Nuck: Though I do respect some design-only people, the ones who can work in tandem with a programmer and still know their backend somewhat

[02:30] mrryanjohnston: just sayin'.
[02:30] Nuck: It'll make Linux feel a bit more like home
[02:30] Sorella: Nuck, depends on what you're doing.
[02:30] jmoiron: i see no reason to ditch vim
[02:30] Nexxy: mrryanjohnston, you misspelled "bitter"

[02:30] Nexxy: you mean aside from your endless rants?
[02:30] chjj: as in "lolbittre"
[02:30] Nuck: I do design, though, so I'll keep Photoshop on Windows 7 dual-booted
[02:30] jmoiron: i work on my actual vim setup on occasion, either adding/modifying plugins, or picking up new habits
[02:30] Sorella: then yes. Specially if it's C programming.
[02:30] Nuck: Nexxy: Yes, that too
[02:31] mrryanjohnston: jmoiron: you've already reached the end of the pathway. you're one step away from thinking the lines and having them appear on screen

[02:31] Sorella: Node also counts :3
[02:31] Nuck: I do JS for the most part, rarely venture beyond

[02:41] Nexxy: xchat!

[02:41] Nexxy: irssi is great
[02:41] mrryanjohnston: no weechat >:)
[02:41] Nuck: Main reason I didn't use it on Windows was because dear god it's SHIT on here
[02:42] chjj: irssi is the epitome of human achievement in irc clients
[02:42] Nexxy: Nuck, that's why you install putty on windows
[02:42] tristanp: obviously with the info in those strings..
[02:42] tuhoojabotti: Nuck: irssi is NOT shit on Windows, terminal emulation is.
[02:42] Nexxy: and just SSH to the actual irssi instance
[02:42] Nexxy: on your VPS
[02:42] Nuck: Mostly because it uses cmd.exe yeah
[02:42] Nuck: VPSes are for Noobs
[02:42] tristanp: openssl 0.9.8e

[02:44] tuhoojabotti: hmm
[02:44] tuhoojabotti: If I can find it.

[02:45] Nuck: I'm actually surprised nobody has built a way to run Mac OS X apps on Linux yet
[02:45] Nuck: At least AFAIK

[02:45] tristanp: yeah that's what's making this difficult :/
[02:45] Nexxy: Nuck, you're forgetting that Apple exists

[02:52] Nuck: Pinky on CTRL, Pointer finger on C

[03:17] mikola: the docs are not too specific on it, but if I call emit on an event emitter, does it fire immediately or does it wait until the current function returns?
[03:17] guybrush: its only git-links

[03:40] SubStack: arlolra: jquery-browserify just writes to module.exports and jadeify just does var $ = require('jquery-browserify') in a function so that shouldn't leak
[03:40] brianseeders has joined the channel
[03:41] SubStack: maybe there are some side-effects in jquery-browserify that prevent it from being used alongside another jquery instance

[03:41] isaacs: abraxas: too eyeball-deep in zlib to think about that right now
[03:41] isaacs: .
[03:42] abraxas: isaacs: understood. but considering the fact that it's a private repo, i'm not sure if i'm actually allowed to do thatâ€¦ in it's raw form anyway.
[03:42] dexter_e has joined the channel
[03:42] isaacs: abraxas: ok, so, create an isolated test case.
[03:42] isaacs: abraxas: there are a lot of non-private repos out there :)
[03:42] abraxas: isaacs: i'll have a look at it, and currently open issuesâ€¦ thanks for the feedback

[04:09] dexter_e: If we want to have Models to represent our databases and all database APIs consist of callbacks, does that mean our Model interface must be based on callbacks too ?
[04:09] arlolra has left the channel
[04:09] Nexxy: be sure to keep us posted!
[04:09] Nuck: Nexxy: I'm just kinda giggling at how slowly this shit is going

[04:09] Nexxy: l2 eSata
[04:09] Nuck: It feels like I should be at 10GB
[04:10] Nuck: Nexxy: I'm doing this over SCP
[04:10] dexter_e: Accessing properties of a database backed Model must be based on callbacks?
[04:10] Nexxy: oh lol
[04:10] Nexxy: on your uber home network?
[04:10] Nuck: Yeah
[04:10] Nexxy: over wifi?
[04:10] Nexxy: ._.
[04:10] Nuck: Over 802.11n for half the journey
[04:10] Nuck: Then gigabit ethernet the rest of the way
[04:10] Nexxy: like it matters at that point
[04:11] Nexxy: ;P

[04:20] tbranyen: weird not in 0.5.6pre either
[04:20] shipit_ has joined the channel
[04:20] Nuck: I feel like Harmony might be another ECMAScript 4 :/
[04:20] abjorn: I feel like you might be another YOUR FACE
[04:20] Nuck: It breaks from a lot of the core concepts in JS
[04:20] abjorn: later
[04:20] abjorn: actually I kinda feel the same
[04:21] JakeyChan has joined the channel
[04:21] Nuck: And I don't think it'll gain a lot of traction in the JS community because it's so different
[04:21] abjorn: most of the proposals are neato though as far as server-side javascript goes
[04:21] abjorn: some of it doesn't seem right for clientside tho
[04:21] Nuck: hehe I'm sure
[04:21] Nuck: But a lot of it seems like trying to fix something that isn't broken
[04:21] Nuck: Like classes
[04:22] Nuck: Classes are nice, but JS is not a classical language
[04:22] abjorn: That's not fixing something that isn't broken, it's introducing a convenient feature for some people that want it.
[04:22] Nuck: But two forms of inheritance?
[04:22] Nuck: WTF are we?  Java?
[04:22] tuhoojabotti: By the name!
[04:22] Nuck: haha
[04:22] abjorn: Not really, last I checked the proposals call for it just being syntactic sugar for prototypes
[04:22] tuhoojabotti: god I hate parsing strings. ;D
[04:23] Nuck: Well, *that* is better
[04:23] Nuck: But don't market it as classes
[04:23] abjorn: you and me both buddy, you and me both...
[04:23] tbranyen: java has two forms of inheritance?
[04:23] tbranyen: wat
[04:23] SubStack: so long as I can close over variables with it
[04:23] Nuck: tbranyen: I'm joking about the bloat
[04:23] abjorn: @tbranyen: that's what I thought lol
[04:23] Nuck: SubStack: Haha, so true
[04:23] tbranyen: oh
[04:23] Nuck: THAT is what I want
[04:23] tbranyen: proxies are genuinely useful
[04:23] Nuck: I normally use closures for cases where a Class would be nice
[04:23] tbranyen: i remember eich tweeting at me when i was bugging about lua's metatables
[04:24] tbranyen: and being liek woahhhhh
[04:24] abjorn: I think adding the classes as a wrapper around prototypes is a good idea, though. Adding something that people keep recreating on their own as a standard in the language.
[04:24] Nuck: Certainly, but calling them classes is a bad idea
[04:24] abjorn: As long as it stays just a wrapper around prototypes.
[04:24] abjorn: Probably.
[04:24] Nuck: It makes them seem like something they aren't
[04:24] abjorn: Could find a better name.
[04:24] Nuck: protoclasses :D
[04:24] tbranyen: for in loops sound like something they aren't :-p
[04:24] abjorn: that's just siiilllyyy
[04:24] abjorn: lol
[04:24] Nuck: tbranyen: Haha very true
[04:24] SubStack: if people can already build it I don't see why it needs to be in the language itself
[04:25] Nuck: SubStack: I think this would be nice
[04:25] abjorn: might as well use assembly then, substack :p
[04:25] SubStack: keep it in user space!
[04:25] Nuck: It can be done with a better syntax like this
[04:25] dmkbot: joyent/node: tshinnic: unguarded fs.watchFile cache statWatchers checking fixed - https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/1637
[04:25] tbranyen: SubStack: at that point might as well not introduce anything else?
[04:25] abjorn: "You can already build it!"
[04:25] Nuck: Plus this can be optimized more
[04:25] SubStack: tbranyen: yep
[04:25] tbranyen: ever, since you can't already build almost everything
[04:25] SubStack: proxies you actually can't do in regular javascript
[04:25] SubStack: I'm ok with those
[04:25] iammerrick has joined the channel
[04:25] SubStack: although they should be used sparingly
[04:25] jeffmoss has left the channel
[04:25] tbranyen: Oh well i mean you could write a native extension to get them, like node-proxy does
[04:26] abjorn: @SubStack: If it's something commonly used you can optimize for it in the engine and write it directly in the C/C++.
[04:26] Nuck: I agree with abjorn.
[04:26] abjorn: So there's a benefit there
[04:26] abjorn: and it's just convenient
[04:26] Nuck: I've yearned for something with the language-integration of prototypes, but the fine-grained controls of a closure
[04:27] Nuck: And this could be just that, if done properly
[04:28] Nuck: I am against addition of classes in their (no pun intended) classical form
[04:28] Nuck: But as syntactical sugar over prototypes?  Hell yes.
[04:28] abjorn: Well, if they look like the class wrappers you find now, like resigs simple inheritance thing, I'm all over it
[04:29] Nuck: Like I said, I just want a prototype with closed-over variables
[04:29] Nuck: I'm fine with prototypical inheritance
[04:29] Nuck: That's never been a problem for me
[04:29] mykul|Home has joined the channel
[04:29] abjorn: yeah
[04:29] Nuck: But the lack of private and public variables just kill it for me
[04:30] abjorn: Personally, I worked with C++ a lot before getting into web dev and js, and I think prototypal is...better.
[04:30] abjorn: classes are kinda gay.
[04:30] Nuck: haha
[04:30] abjorn: at least in the C++/Java way
[04:30] Nuck: I like the class style in AS3, honestly
[04:30] abjorn: meh
[04:30] Nuck: But I'd like to see that combined with JS prototypes
[04:30] abjorn: AS3 is like
[04:30] Nuck: AS3 itself is a hideous thing
[04:31] abjorn: javascripts retarded inbred cousin that tried to make out with you once
[04:31] Nuck: abjorn: haha, YES!
[04:31] Nexxy: O_o
[04:31] Nuck: That is a perfect description
[04:31] Nexxy: itc; uneducated language bashing
[04:31] abjorn: What, Nexxy, you know I'm right
[04:31] Nexxy: uhm'
[04:31] Nuck: AS3 was like what happens when you try to merge two languages with VERY different concepts.
[04:31] Nexxy: it's based on ecmascript
[04:31] kiffness_ has joined the channel
[04:31] Nexxy: why hate?
[04:31] Nuck: It just REALLY doesn't work
[04:31] Nexxy: go hate on ruby or something

[04:32] abjorn: I like Ruby.
[04:32] TheCode has joined the channel
[04:32] Nuck: Nexxy: It barely even RESEMBLES ECMAScript!
[04:32] abjorn: That's not true
[04:32] abjorn: It does
[04:32] Nexxy: abjorn, well that would explain our difference in opinion :)
[04:32] abjorn: But not in a good way
[04:32] Nuck: In basic syntax, sure
[04:32] zeiris has joined the channel
[04:32] abjorn: Nexxy: Well, okay, I hate Ruby's syntax
[04:32] Nuck: But in many of the concepts, it changed
[04:32] abjorn: but the way it works, awesome!
[04:32] Nexxy: AS3 is pretty much js + strict typing and native modules
[04:32] Nexxy: what is there to hate?
[04:32] abjorn: and lame classes ;(
[04:32] Nuck: Nexxy: The bitchiness of the language
[04:32] Nuck: You will get an error no matter what
[04:32] Nexxy: Nuck, you're hating on strict typing then
[04:33] Nuck: That's what I learned
[04:33] Nuck: Haha that too
[04:33] Nexxy: not AS3 itself
[04:33] Nuck: I do have a distaste for strict typing
[04:33] abjorn: I have no problem with the strict typing, I'm kinda used to that.
[04:33] Nuck: I think it may be a similar reason to why I hate CS.

[04:33] abjorn: It's just one approach to programming

[04:33] Nuck: ACTION is very protective of JS
[04:33] abjorn: I mean, with loose typing you don't have to think as much initially, but you're going to have to think about it at some point.
[04:33] TheCode: I wonder why my apps won't find modules installed using the -g option.
[04:34] abjorn: because it's going to search the local path
[04:34] Nexxy: Nuck, I'm sure Brendan appreciates your sentiment

[04:34] Nuck: lol
[04:34] abjorn: Nexxy: idk brendan bashes the language himself sometimes lol
[04:34] TheCode: I think it should be smart to look further up
[04:34] abjorn: hence why harmony is taking such a drastic turn
[04:34] Nuck: Brendan is freaked out by how big it's gotten I think
[04:35] Nuck: He designed it with a very small frame of mind
[04:35] fmeyer has joined the channel
[04:35] Nuck: And now it's grown to, well, Node.js!
[04:35] abjorn: TheCode: I've never quite understood it myself, but in general I only use the -g option for modules with a cli, like nodemon or similar.
[04:35] Nexxy: damn Nuck you must have quite an impressive resume
[04:35] Nexxy: designer, coder, mentalist

[04:44] Nuck: tuhoojabotti: I used to get most of my remixes off TheSixtyOne
[04:45] Nuck: But then... Well, they changed their website drastically, and suddenly, people stopped going there and people stopped posting music
[04:45] Nexxy: oh like gawker only with music?
[04:45] abjorn: lol
[04:45] Nuck: lol
[04:45] Nuck: Worse
[04:45] TheCode: abjorn, while you are at it, make sure you support NoSQL out of the box. You'll get lots of techical customers.
[04:45] abjorn: or like facebook except everyone *doesn't* grin and bear it
[04:45] tuhoojabotti: Nuck: The problem is, that it requires flash.
[04:45] Nuck: They went from a sensible web page-style design with a list of music
[04:46] tuhoojabotti: Yeh
[04:46] Nuck: To a new, shitty design
[04:46] abjorn: TheCode: Much to my non-amusement, our target market is not technical customers.
[04:46] Nuck: Which had the whole page dedicated to the song
[04:46] Nuck: And horrible navigation
[04:46] TheCode: Hmmm
[04:46] tuhoojabotti: has*
[04:46] Nuck: It's nigh impossible to find music anymore
[04:46] abjorn: Also, you can run all that shit on a linux box easy, so our vps/dedi customers can use it just fine
[04:46] Nexxy: abjorn, apparently your target market is also not "secure hosting environments" ;P
[04:47] abjorn: weeeelll we diiiddd get ddos'd last week...
[04:47] Nuck: I have better hosting that all you people :3
[04:47] Nuck: hyperized.net

[04:47] abjorn: luckily it was the night shift so I didn't have to be there!
[04:47] abjorn: TheCode: I never had any trouble
[04:47] Nuck: That's my SA
[04:47] abjorn: but I used CouchBase
[04:47] Nexxy: abjorn, what do you guys do in that case?

[04:47] Nexxy: null route the offending IP?
[04:47] abjorn: Couch Base installs ez on CentOS

[04:49] Nuck: In fact, he gave us that when we just asked for a "simple VPS to basic testing on"
[04:49] abjorn: my vps has 4 cores and 1 gb ram ;(
[04:50] Nuck: He needs bigger clients to expand his business, so by helping us get started, he stands to gain a big client
[04:50] abjorn: yeah

[04:53] abjorn: I only say bad things about customers because I have to deal with the ones who have problems all day, and statistically I'm going to get a lot of dumb ones that break their sites. Like one today who decided to delete his public_html directory.
[04:53] tuhoojabotti: I want to sing you guys a song
[04:54] Nuck: tuhoojabotti: lolololol

[04:55] abjorn: Had one guy awhile back that deleted everything in his home directory except for hidden files and folders. All he wanted to get rid of was a single .htaccess file.
[04:55] tuhoojabotti: rm -rf .
[04:55] cliffano has joined the channel
[04:55] mosen: hi node. I can't seem to compile node-glob (glob) on node 0.5.5/osx.. anyone heard of this?
[04:55] Nexxy: in all fairness, .htaccess files are pretty cunning
[04:55] abjorn: lol i have a funny story about that too, tuhoojabotti
[04:56] abjorn: mosen: deets?
[04:56] tuhoojabotti: abjorn: My story: I had no home folder. ;__;
[04:56] abjorn: lol
[04:56] tuhoojabotti: Had to call in a ticket right away ;D
[04:56] abjorn: But yeah, in training they showed us a support ticket
[04:56] abjorn: where basically one of the support techs rm -rf'd a guy's entire vps
[04:56] mosen: abjorn, invalid conversion from int* to void* basically.. npm install glob
[04:56] Nuck: I have a cofounder at my startup, our mobile dev, and he recently switched to an overbooked n00b's hosting (it was a few bucks cheaper)
[04:56] isaacs has joined the channel
[04:57] mosen: abjorn, grabbing the line number etc
[04:57] Nuck: And they fucked up his iptables
[04:57] abjorn: jesus how would they manage to do that
[04:57] abjorn: why would they even be touching it?
[04:57] Nuck: I think it was liek they entered a 7 instead of 17 or something
[04:57] Nuck: abjorn: My sentiments exactly

[04:57] tuhoojabotti: abjorn: Then there's the uninstall script that deletes your /usr
[04:58] abjorn: I mean, if a customer needs a port opened or something, we do it, but we contact our Linux Admin's to do that.
[04:58] Nexxy: ya man iptables is some hardcore stuff
[04:58] Nuck: Like I said, overbooked n00b
[04:58] Nexxy: hence horrible wrappers like ufw
[04:58] jonaslund_ has joined the channel
[04:58] abjorn: Well, we're shared hosting (mostly) so our stuff is "overbooked" but we don't fuck up that bad lol
[04:59] Nexxy: overselling != overbooked
[04:59] abjorn: then what do you mean by overbooked
[04:59] Nexxy: idk what he meant
[04:59] Nexxy: but there's nothign wrong with overselling ;3
[04:59] Nexxy: as long as you scale to accomidate your clients needs
[04:59] abjorn: yeah, just so long as you know what you're getting
[04:59] Nuck: As I understand, he was selling high-specced VPSes for $7 a pop
[04:59] abjorn: lol
[04:59] thalll has joined the channel
[04:59] Nuck: And put more on a single physical server than he should have
[04:59] Nuck: To make up for it
[04:59] abjorn: overselling VPS's, now that's a terrible idea
[04:59] Nuck: Yup
[05:00] abjorn: also makes no sense at all
[05:00] Nuck: overselling webservers?  That's not a big deal
[05:00] cliffano: isaacs: is it possible to add another author to an already published module in npmjs.org ? the original author of nodelint can't be contacted, there are others who maintain the source on github, but are unable to publish to npmjs.org
[05:00] Nuck: overselling VPSes?  Now that takes a lunatic
[05:00] abjorn: cliffano: he left
[05:00] Nexxy: there is a fine line between lunatic and genius
[05:00] cliffano: abjorn: ah, thanks
[05:00] abjorn: And they stayed well in the lunatic camp, Nexxy

[05:02] Nuck: politics is one thing every intelligent person should agree on
[05:02] Nuck: Everyone is evil
[05:02] abjorn: that's a good one, nuck
[05:02] abjorn: everyone agreeing on politics, thats funny
[05:03] abjorn: anyways, that guy that rm -rf'd a customer's VPS
[05:03] Nuck: abjorn: It's mostly the feeble-minded who fall prey to the propoganda
[05:03] abjorn: they showed it in a training as like a "what not to do"
[05:03] Nuck: Wait, an EMPLOYEE rm -rf'd?
[05:03] abjorn: which, I mean, you would think would be obvious but
[05:03] Nuck: D:
[05:03] abjorn: yep
[05:03] Nuck: Dear god
[05:03] Nexxy: I rm -rf'd a company car once
[05:03] Nexxy: true story
[05:03] abjorn: this is why chat support aren't supposed to ssh into a vps
[05:04] Nuck: Telling Linux users not to do `rm -rf` is like telling Windows uers not to delete System32
[05:04] abjorn: or deltree
[05:04] Nuck: That's a bit less obviously bad
[05:04] Nuck: What gave the guy the idea to run rm -rf!?
[05:04] abjorn: But, they also showed it to us in training to tell us that we can fuck up big and so long as we own up to it we'll be fine. Cause the guy who did that still works here.
[05:05] abjorn: I have NO idea.
[05:05] Nexxy: I accidentally `rm -rf /*` once ;3
[05:05] abjorn: I read the ticket and never did figure out what possessed him to do such a thing

[05:05] mosen: I cannot get glob to compile at all :|
[05:06] Nexxy: mosen, lol no
[05:06] abjorn: Actually, that guy not only still works here, but works in QA now...so he actually got promoted - twice, to Quality Assurance of all things lol
[05:06] Nexxy: we just somehow managed to park it where no one could find it
[05:06] Nuck: abjorn: If anyone can break something, he can?
[05:06] abjorn: Well no one can say he doesn't know what not  to do
[05:06] Nexxy: and they were about to file a police report by the time someone asked either of us
[05:06] abjorn: hahaha
[05:06] abjorn: I accidentally the whole car
[05:06] Nuck: Nexxy: That's akin to moving your entire filesystem into a hidden directory
[05:07] Nexxy: Nuck, except we were told to park it in the back from now on
[05:07] Nexxy: and apparently no one else got the memo
[05:07] Nexxy: nor did they think to check the back lot
[05:07] abjorn: rofl
[05:07] Nexxy: keys were in the office
[05:07] Nexxy: car was gone
[05:07] Nuck: abjorn: Maybe they wanted to keep that person as far away from the Linux servers as possible?
[05:08] abjorn: lol
[05:08] Nuck: Keep him from anything containing customer data
[05:08] abjorn: Well he had to be promoted to level 2 support before goingto QA, so that doesn't quite work
[05:08] Nuck: lol
[05:08] abjorn: I've talked to him, he's actually really good at this stuff lol
[05:09] abjorn: idk, after a certain point I can kind of understand how someone can fuck up bad at this job
[05:09] Nuck: abjorn: You in the support department?

[05:11] abjorn: but, well, my friends position was PHP developer and he has to mess with perl a lot too
[05:12] abjorn: anyways, linux admins get paid more anyways so I'll just work my way there :D

[05:16] abjorn: 0.4.x is current stable
[05:17] abjorn: night ya'll
[05:17] Nuck: They use Apache?

[05:26] tbranyen: interesting
[05:26] Daegalus: eh, I am happy with it, I write apps for it. etc.
[05:26] tbranyen: didn't know that
[05:27] Nuck: IE10 is *barely* enough for me to call IE a modern browser
[05:27] Nuck: And the UI on it is completely batshit
[05:27] Daegalus: Nuck: yes, i agree, I hate IE, but it works, and I am not complaining. I like WP7 more than the other platforms

If I wanted an OS that is locked down to the point of no return, sure, but no thanks. Even jailbroken with Cydia it was bullshit
[05:31] Nuck: Daegalus: Meh, the lockin doesn't bother me that much, I like that it keeps the shit apps out

[05:31] Daegalus: Nuck: I meant a different type of lockin, but sure.
[05:31] Nuck: Nexxy: Well, it means a better signal-to-noise ratio
[05:32] Nuck: Daegalus: Heh, well, having one unified place to get updates, having a simple pathway for everything
[05:32] Nuck: That's what I want in a phone
[05:32] Nuck: I could care less if it's able to run fucking ANYTHING
[05:32] Nuck: Or if I can mod it out
[05:32] Daegalus: And I get that from Android and even more so with WP7
[05:32] Nuck: No, I want a phone that works, plain and simple
[05:32] Nuck: And Apple built that
[05:32] Daegalus: Android and WP7 do...

[05:33] Nuck: No unified updates pathway

[05:37] Daegalus: You can, there is a WP7 launcher for Android
[05:37] Nuck: And you'd have better apps and less Microsoft
[05:37] Nuck: Because Microsoft is almost always shitty
[05:37] Nuck: ACTION points to Windows 8
[05:38] Nuck: (it's getting worse)
[05:38] Daegalus: haha, the apps on WP7 are top notch because Microsoft screens every single one for bugs, and if it has anything amiss, they shit it out back to you with a full bug report and QA. Then if it ever crashes they give you full Repro steps to fix it
[05:38] Daegalus: they dont let shit apps through 98% of hte time
[05:38] Daegalus: I like Win8 actually
[05:38] Nuck: Daegalus: What was this thing about Apple being "lockin"?
[05:39] Nuck: Wow, sure sounds like they found the steps to reproduce a Locked-down OS
[05:39] Nuck: And Windows 8 looks great.  For a tablet
[05:39] Daegalus: I said lockin as in they lock you in to Apple only software, with itunes, their iCloud, their Facetimes crap, etc.
[05:39] Nuck: Daegalus: I can use Skype for video chat, I can use Dropbox to get audio, I can jailbreak my iPhone, etc.
[05:40] Nuck: There's only as much lockin as you peg on it
[05:40] Daegalus: plus they have some of the stupidest and shittiest restrictions on developers. while Microsoft doesn't, they just check to see the app works and isnt crap
[05:40] Nuck: Hehe, I'll give them that one

[05:40] Nexxy: yeah like removing access to uuid
[05:40] Nexxy: completely logical
[05:41] Nuck: They aren't doing that yet, but I can see the problem, yeah
[05:41] Nuck: I understand it was being abused though
[05:41] Nexxy: it's how Apple says "We <3 Developers"
[05:41] Nexxy: no

[05:41] Nexxy: it was being used in a way only APPLE wants to be able to use it

[05:41] Nuck: UUID was being abused by advertising companies to keep track of ads
[05:41] Nuck: And that was not what it was meant for
[05:41] Nexxy: since when is that abuse?
[05:41] Nexxy: lol
[05:41] Nuck: So they removed it
[05:41] snowinferno has joined the channel
[05:41] Nuck: Well
[05:41] Nuck: Deprecated
[05:42] Nuck: An App can generate its own tokens
[05:42] Nuck: I expect the companies will find a workaround for the removal of UUIDs, anyways
[05:43] Nexxy: Nuck,

[05:45] Daegalus: Anyways, I think we can boggle this down to we all have our preferences, we all have shit that we hate, adn they dictate our choices. But I have a WP7 phone, Android tablet, a Macbook Air running OSX and Win7, and a Desktop running Linux/Win7. Oh and an Iphone 3g thats running Android. Soooo I use what i like in each instance
[05:45] Nuck: haha
[05:45] Nuck: That's quite a menagrie
[05:46] Nuck: Er, I misspelled that horribly

[05:48] Daegalus: ummmm no
[05:48] Nexxy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0_7BbNv1XE
[05:49] Nexxy: they went way minimalist!
[05:49] Nexxy: although win10 isn't released until 2024
[05:49] Nuck: hahaha Apple is a religiou, I agree
[05:49] Nuck: But not mine
[05:49] Nexxy: Nuck, then you realize how ridiculous you sound 90% of the time you're talking about an apple product?
[05:49] Nuck: It's not that I actually love Apple, it's that they're the best products right now
[05:50] Nuck: They're a few years ahead in each product they release: superlight laptops, tablets, smartphones, etc.
[05:50] Nexxy: perhaps for little kids and grandmas
[05:50] andrewfff has joined the channel
[05:50] Nexxy: there are a multitude of superlight laptops on the market
[05:50] Nuck: They take what has been tried, scrap the previous ideas, and make it actually useful
[05:50] Nuck: Not when Macbook air came out
[05:50] Nuck: Not nearly as thin
[05:51] Nuck: There's a reason they were able to corner the market for all the production equipment for unibodies
[05:51] ding: Hi all, I'm having trouble initializing a custom node module. I want to run an init() function before the exports are set. So, I made init() accept a callback, and then the callback defines the exports. However, that doesn't seem to work. Any suggestions?
[05:51] Nexxy: you can't really continuously change your definition of "Best" and expect people to take you seriously
[05:51] Nexxy: it's LIGHT! I MEAN eyecandied! No! Elegant!
[05:51] Nuck: Nexxy: They're everything
[05:51] Nexxy: religion
[05:52] Nuck: They have elegant eyecandy, they're lightweight, and they're powerful
[05:52] Nuck: They're a jack of all trades
[05:52] Daegalus: Nuck: I agree they have great hardware, but its not that far ahead. THey are currently falling behind in innovation, especially in teh iPhone and iPad as they arent keeping up hardware wise. Plus Samsugn makes just as good hardware becasue they make 50% of hte hardware in an iPhone/iPad, including the most important, the processor
[05:52] Nuck: And that makes them nice
[05:52] Nexxy: so powerful 
[05:52] Nexxy: they'll melt your face off
[05:52] Nexxy: with their lack of adequate cooling
[05:52] Nuck: Daegalus: Specs don't matter
[05:52] Nexxy: MOLTEN LAPTOP IS BEST LAPTOP
[05:52] Nuck: ACTION points to Wii
[05:52] Nexxy: ACTION points to fire hydrant
[05:52] Nuck: Lowest-specced system from that generation
[05:52] Nexxy: oh look! equally as irrelevant!
[05:52] Nuck: And yet, the most popular
[05:52] Nuck: Why?  It was groundbreaking
[05:52] Nexxy: why? because it came in white
[05:52] Nuck: It didn't build on a market, it *created* a market
[05:52] Daegalus: Nuck: To me they do, and yes, I have a brand new macbook air, its amazing hardware, but Samsung makes the same thing, and looks just as nice.
[05:53] Daegalus: Im with nexxy, the White i what sold me
[05:53] Daegalus: I like white electronics
[05:53] Daegalus: my iphone 3g is white
[05:53] Nexxy: there's a racist joke just waiting to happen
[05:53] Nuck: Daegalus: Samsunc makes the same thing *now*
[05:53] Nuck: They didn't when Apple released the Air
[05:53] Nexxy: Daegalus, nuck likes to judge current technology based on the standard 3 years ago
[05:53] Nuck: Apple does not innovate in small increments
[05:53] Nuck: They reinvent things every few years
[05:53] Daegalus: Nuck: Because they were too busy building the hardware inside it?
[05:54] Nuck: Daegalus: haha yeah, on Apple's specs
[05:54] Nuck: And Samsung still doesn't have unibodies, I'd bet
[05:54] SamuraiJack has joined the channel
[05:54] Nuck: Since Apple cornered the market for producing those aluminum unibodies
[05:54] Daegalus: No one does, because no one cares to invest in tehm. I personally dont care for unibodies, they make no difference ot me
[05:54] ph^ has joined the channel
[05:55] Nuck: Daegalus: They're lighter, stronger, and thinner than a plastic case
[05:55] Nuck: So they're great for ultraslim laptops
[05:55] Daegalus: meh, a few millimeters doesnt matter to me
[05:55] Daegalus: Nexxy: I got that a while ago :P
[05:55] Nuck: As I understand, most ultraslims have been forced to use other things
[05:55] Nexxy: just making sure you were on the same page ;3
[05:56] Nexxy: it's more entertaining once you realize he's just insane
[05:56] Nuck: I judge Apple by the current situation at the time they release a product
[05:56] Nuck: So, I judge their performance with Macbook Air by the market at that time: no ultraslims like that
[05:56] Wa has joined the channel
[05:56] ericmuyser has joined the channel
[05:57] Nuck: iPhone: phones were "dumb terminals"
[05:57] Daegalus: I judge based on whats going to be released and how it will work for me and what I get out of it. Instead of jumping on the first thing Apple forfeeds me, I wait a month for all the nicer products tht are more my fit to come out. I prefer samsung hardware over Apple 90% o fhte time
[05:57] Nuck: iPad: tablets were failed ideas
[05:57] Nuck: Apple innovates in bursts at a very slow rate
[05:57] Nuck: Msot companies slowly build up
[05:57] Nuck: Compare laptops now to laptops 5 years ago, they look very similarly, and jsut have higher specs
[05:58] Nexxy: where is that infographic comparing the iPad to a compaq tablet from 2002
[05:58] Daegalus: To me thats really the most important part, the specs. I dont care if it looks like s asquare black brick, as long as it gives me the performance and specs I want
[05:58] Nuck: haha Nexxy
[05:58] Nuck: tablets weren't really big until iPad, then they grew into an actual product category aside from computers
[05:58] Daegalus: Hell, I think the Chromebook looks damn sexy. I love the chromebook
[05:59] Nexxy: lol
[05:59] Nuck: NOW we have Android Tablets
[05:59] Nexxy: Nuck
[05:59] Nexxy: you're talking about advertising power
[05:59] Nuck: I agree, Chromebook looks epic
[05:59] Nexxy: not device performance
[05:59] Nexxy: figure out what you're going to preach about
[05:59] Nexxy: lol
[05:59] Nuck: Nexxy: I could care less about performance
[05:59] Nexxy: obviously
[05:59] Nuck: I'm looking at their power to innovate in CONCEPT
[05:59] Daegalus: Nuck: Without Samsungs innovation, Apples innovation would be nowhere
[05:59] Nexxy: if it wasn't for objective consumers we'd still be sitting around with Apple IIs and loving it
[05:59] Nuck: Daegalus: Yup, they take other people's work and  refien it
[05:59] Nexxy: but they would just look SO pretty
[05:59] Nuck: I admit it
[06:00] thepatr1ck: good marketing is worthless without a good product, a good product goes nowhere without good marketing.
[06:00] Nexxy: thepatr1ck, dilbert comics disagree with you
[06:00] Nuck: Nexxy: If it weren't for Apple, we'd still be GUI-less
[06:00] Nuck: ACTION points to Apple Lisa
[06:00] Nuck: Mouse.
[06:00] Nexxy: Nuck, tell that to Xerox
[06:00] Nexxy: rofl
[06:00] Nuck: Nexxy: Xerox abandoned the concept
[06:00] TheCode: It's XEROX who did GUI
[06:00] thepatr1ck: Nexxy: I hate to say it, but dilbert isn't always right ;)
[06:00] Daegalus: Nexxy: you took teh words right out of my mind
[06:00] thepatr1ck: (mostly yes, but not always)
[06:00] Nuck: Xerox HAD the idea
[06:00] Dreamer3 has joined the channel
[06:00] Nexxy: lmao
[06:00] Nuck: But didn't see the potential
[06:01] Nexxy: you're just digging yourself a deeper hole at this point
[06:01] TheCode: No, they demoed it to JObs and party
[06:01] Nexxy: but it's highly entertaining
[06:01] Nuck: Hence why we never saw Xerox-branded computers
[06:01] thepatr1ck: has anyone here actually seen the XEROX GUI?
[06:01] TheCode: Steve Jobs did
[06:01] Daegalus: thepatr1ck: yes on their printers
[06:01] TheCode: :D
[06:01] Nexxy: thepatr1ck, yeah I was just at a self serve copy center
[06:01] thepatr1ck: (I haven't, but from what I have heard it's not very good)
[06:01] TheCode: It was primitive, so 
[06:01] Nuck: The Xerox GUI was really horrible, from what I hear
[06:01] Daegalus: Anyways, Jobs/Gates took the GUI idea from Xerox printers
[06:01] TheCode: It should have been
[06:02] Daegalus: SOmeone needs to stream Pirates of the Silicon Valley in here
[06:02] Nexxy: excuse me, Daegalus 
[06:02] Nuck: As I said,  they take other people's work and  refine it
[06:02] TheCode: It was a long long time ago
[06:02] Nexxy: this is Nuck's world
[06:02] Nexxy: Apple *invented* the GUI
[06:02] Nuck: They didn't invent it
[06:02] Nuck: They pioneered it
[06:02] Nuck: They took the idea and made it into what we know and love
[06:02] Nuck: Apple never creates
[06:02] Daegalus: Tell that to Windows 95
[06:02] Nuck: They made a wiser choice than that
[06:02] Nuck: Daegalus: Windows 95 created a Start button.
[06:03] TheCode: Nexxy is trolling I guess

[06:04] Nuck: And market the stolen-and-refined result
[06:04] Nuck: It's a genius strategy, when you really think about it
[06:05] Daegalus: And when they run out of ideas they go into an almost bankruptcy slump like in the days pre-OSX

[06:05] Nuck: Daegalus: That wasn't running out of ideas, that was not having Steve Jobs

[06:06] thepatr1ck: that wasn't running out of ideas, that was having too many ideas that weren't well refined or executed. 
[06:06] Nuck: Haha very true thepatr1ck
[06:06] Daegalus: I think the best step Apple made was ditching PowerPC finally
[06:06] Nuck: I agree
[06:07] Nuck: They held onto PowerPC for way too long
[06:07] Nuck: Surprising they went to Intel at the time
[06:07] Nexxy: I feel like I'm watching a steve jobs/apple documentary on ketamine
[06:07] Nuck: But they made the right choice
[06:07] Daegalus: Funny though, OSX had an x86 version from the get go. 
[06:07] Daegalus: it was just never released till they switched over
[06:07] Nuck: Well, it was built on the OS he developed at NeXT
[06:08] Nuck: Whatever architecture was at NeXT, was carried over to Mac OS X
[06:08] Daegalus: Darwin was developed at NeXT?
[06:08] thepatr1ck: I think that was a case of keeping big developers like Adobe/Microsoft happy and not forcing two migrations (PPC->x86/x64) and Classic->Carbon/Cocoa
[06:08] Nuck: Daegalus: Partially
[06:08] thepatr1ck: at once
[06:08] Nexxy: Daegalus, LMFAO
[06:08] Nexxy: you're mean
[06:08] Nuck: Daegalus: The basis for it, yes.
[06:08] Nuck: Definitely there
[06:09] Daegalus: Nexxy: you got me. :P

[06:09] dominictarr has joined the channel
[06:09] Nuck: It seems like it'd be easy as hell to hack together a way to run OS X apps on Darwin
[06:10] Nuck: thepatr1ck: That's an interesting theory
[06:10] Nexxy: fffff why is memegenerator down when I need it
[06:10] Nuck: Nexxy: Same servers as Apple Store :D
[06:10] Daegalus: Nuck: Umm, because of Cocoa
[06:10] Nuck: Daegalus: Shouldn't be too hard to port that onto Darwin
[06:11] Daegalus: If i remember right, its not open-source, so no one can compile it to anythign else
[06:11] thepatr1ck: Nuck: darwin can run core foundation apps can't it? just not AppKit ones
[06:11] Nuck: Yeah, I think it's the AppKit ones that don't work
[06:11] Nuck: But that's basically everything
[06:11] chjj: sourceforge is so atrocious
[06:11] chjj: it shouldnt take me 15 clicks to get to the code
[06:11] Nuck: chjj: Hence why github is growing?
[06:12] Nuck: All OS X native apps are done in AppKit these days
[06:12] thepatr1ck: Nuck: and I might be completely wrong about the time between OSX & intel, but it wouldn't surprise me if they wanted to minimise the scaring off of developers
[06:12] blkcat: chjj: whoa, sourceforge is still around?
[06:12] Nexxy: yay
[06:12] Nuck: thepatr1ck: I'm sure part of that period was also them letting developers port to x86
[06:12] chjj: blkcat: i guess so =/
[06:13] Nuck: They probably gave preview copies to companies like Adobe, so they could get started on the switch
[06:13] Nexxy: Nuck, you inspired me; http://i.imgur.com/R163d.jpg
[06:13] Nuck: I still feel somebody needs to port AppKit over to Darwin
[06:13] Daegalus: No one can, its not open-source, you gotta go ask Apple

[06:27] Nuck: That one?
[06:27] chjj: nuck: i understand why linus said github is messing with commits, if you saw this one pull request he got, the committer did the dumbest things, added random whitespace etc, so the diff was a mess
[06:27] chjj: probably lead him to believe that github was messing with things when it was that inept committer
[06:27] Nuck: chjj: Well, as schacon pointed out, that's from the web editor, and he admits it's a bad thing and that it'll be fixed soon
[06:28] chjj: i think we might be talking about different things

[06:45] Nuck: Eh, sounds like a problem with NPM to me
[06:45] minemoney has joined the channel
[06:45] Nuck: Maybe it's shoving it in the wrong hole?
[06:45] TheCode: in the stink?
[06:45] Nuck: perhaps
[06:45] Nuck: I hear NPM's creator has the same issues
[06:45] Nuck: ACTION starts a nasty rumor about Isaac
[06:46] TheCode: npm installs them successfully
[06:46] TheCode: Node just can't find them
[06:46] Nuck: TheCode: As I said, amybe it's putting them in the wrong place
[06:46] Nuck: Node checks a very specific set of locations, I can't imagine it failing to resolve them
[06:46] TheCode: what's wrong about that place?
[06:47] TheCode: Oh wait
[06:47] Nuck: who knows, maybe it's just not Node's location?
[06:47] secoif: if I've got a child process, how can I simply spit out anything that appears on stdout, without a newline (ie no console.log)
[06:47] secoif: ie is there an eqivalent to console.log, without a newline
[06:48] Nuck: Eh, I think child.stdin.pipe(process.stdout)?
[06:48] Nuck: Something like that
[06:48] nephics has joined the channel
[06:48] Nuck: Since they're both Streams, they should be pipable
[06:48] AvianFlu: Nuck: what you just said last is true
[06:49] AvianFlu: I haven't read up for context

[06:49] mykul|Home has joined the channel
[06:49] Nuck: AvianFlu: What?
[06:49] secoif: I think I just need process.stdout.write
[06:49] secoif: thanks Nuck 
[06:49] Nuck: secoif: Well, if you're just piping, there's a utility for that already ;)
[06:49] AvianFlu: child.stdout.on('data', function (data) {} )
[06:49] AvianFlu: that's the other way
[06:49] tablasckmore has joined the channel
[06:50] AvianFlu: and then you'd take data and do like, total += data each time
[06:50] Nuck: In Node.js, they will shoot you if you don't make it modular
[06:50] AvianFlu: instead of logging each chunk
[06:50] groom has joined the channel
[06:50] AvianFlu: In the Node.js community, no one will shoot you
[06:50] Nuck: I disagree.  I once got chewed out by everyone in here for using globals.
[06:50] AvianFlu: we're nice
[06:50] secoif: hang on...
[06:50] Nuck: And I stand by my decision.
[06:51] AvianFlu: that's cause it's a dumb idea, people aren't just being mean
[06:51] shanebo has joined the channel
[06:51] Nuck: AvianFlu: Globals are for global things, I use them for what they're designed for.
[06:51] Nuck: It's not like I'm misusing them or overusing them
[06:51] AvianFlu: that's certainly a true sentence, and I wish you the best!
[06:51] AvianFlu: don't get me wrong
[06:51] Nuck: I refuse to use them for anything that would be better served by require()
[06:51] secoif: I have child.stdout.on('data', function(data) {process.stdout.write('data')})
[06:51] AvianFlu: you just have a habit of sounding like you're re-inventing a wheel a lot of the time
[06:52] secoif: is there something wrong with that?
[06:52] Nuck: AvianFlu: Haha, it's always a learning experience for me

[06:52] minemoney has left the channel
[06:52] AvianFlu: secoif: no, I don't believe so

[06:52] petrjanda has joined the channel
[06:52] Nuck: secoif: If you're not modifying or dealing with the data, it's probably shinierto use pipe
[06:52] AvianFlu: yes
[06:52] secoif: thanks
[06:52] secoif: that looks cleaner
[06:52] AvianFlu: pipe handles a lot of stuff for you that needs to be handled
[06:52] Nuck: yeah
[06:53] secoif: yeah i'm not modifying the data
[06:53] Nuck: It deals with pauses and such
[06:53] Nuck: So it's a lot more robust
[06:53] AvianFlu: flow control, as opposed to control flow
[06:53] secoif: this is just in a build script, and I want to print the output of my test suite
[06:53] AvianFlu: yeah, pipe will work great for you there
[06:53] secoif: :D
[06:53] AvianFlu: streaming data FTW
[06:53] secoif: sweet
[06:53] AvianFlu: it's one of the great strengths of node, IMO
[06:53] secoif: AvianFlu++
[06:53] v8bot_:  secoif has given a beer to AvianFlu. AvianFlu now has 1 beers.

[06:55] Nuck: I have found some great uses for pipe
[06:55] Daegalus: Hmm, can someone explain this pipe thing to me, I am not quite sure what people are refering to with it. What is it actually used for? (I might know already, just not sure)
[06:55] dominictarr: it's just using pipe without {end: false} will close process.stdout which will probably crash something soon.
[06:55] Nuck: Like taking data dumped into the body of an HTTP POST request, and piping it straight into a file
[06:56] Nuck: Daegalus: Basically, it takes Stream A and, as the name implies, pipes it to Stream B.
[06:56] dominictarr: it's like ls -1d | grep whatever | cat
[06:56] Daegalus: ok cool, makes sense. Kinda thought that but had to make sure
[06:56] Nuck: Yup, hence why it's named for that, dominictarr
[06:57] secoif: I'd like to see pipe used in the node examples more, every example uses console.log
[06:57] Nuck: hehe
[06:57] nephics has left the channel
[06:57] Nuck: They should change that example for child_process to use pipe, I agree
[06:57] Nuck: But console.log does its job we
[06:57] Nuck: *well
[06:57] dominictarr: people should definately use pipe, and streams more, and for more things
[06:57] Nuck: dominictarr: Ayup

[07:01] aah: I've got about 20 services blowing out a redis instance.  any way of sharing a pool across VM instances?  do we have shared memory yet?
[07:01] shanebo: thepatr1ck was that in answer to me?
[07:01] Nuck: shanebo: I haven't, but I imagine it'd be easy to do with something like Haraka
[07:01] thepatr1ck: shanebo: yes, forgot to prefix it.
[07:02] shanebo: thepatr1ck can you give me pseudo code? I don't even know where to begin...
[07:02] Nuck: ewww pseudocode?
[07:02] Nuck: ACTION gags
[07:02] Nuck: ACTION codes directly in JS
[07:03] thepatr1ck: I took http://smtp2web.com/ and made it a whole lot better for my purposes (I actually parse the email there and do a normal form encoded POST instead of just passing the raw message)
[07:03] shanebo: Nuck, you know what pseudo code is right?
[07:03] Nuck: Yes, I do
[07:03] Nuck: Sadly
[07:03] shanebo: Nuck, so saying something like...
[07:04] chjj: cause it clearly has no use, now that weve gained this divine knowledge from lord nuck
[07:04] Nuck: haha it has use
[07:04] Nuck: But I don't bother with it
[07:04] Nuck: It's useful to some people
[07:04] Nuck: But it's an odd thing to share
[07:04] shanebo: email goes to webserver, webserver catches it and routes to a given url, you parse/prep/post
[07:04] yenz: chjj: nuck makes a lot more sense when you consider that he's oly like 15 or something ;)
[07:04] yenz: *only
[07:04] Nuck: Anyways, I think this would be an ideal situation for Haraka
[07:04] Nuck: yenz: Haha, I'm almost 18
[07:05] thepatr1ck: shanebo: it's python, and twisted and it's web interface lives on app engine for no apparent reason, but here is my source https://github.com/thepatrick/smtp2web

[07:07] paulwe has joined the channel
[07:07] Nuck: A simple library that provides an evented mail server, now THAT would be epic
[07:07] thepatr1ck: the advantage the smtp2web code has is that twisted provides 99% of an smtp server so writing something like s2w is piss easy.
[07:07] Nuck: You just do server.send(), etc.
[07:07] Nuck: thepatr1ck: My understanding is that Twisted provides 99% of EVERYTHING
[07:08] Nuck: Which sounds pretty horrific for me
[07:08] Nuck: I've been spoiled by the NodeJS structure
[07:08] shanebo: i'm using nodemailer for smtp and it's been great
[07:08] thepatr1ck: smtp2web (my version) for example is less than 500 lines (include whitespace, comments, and the ridiculous number of includes one writes when writing python)
[07:08] Nuck: shanebo: Ditto
[07:08] shanebo: thepatr1ck, nice! port it over to node ;)
[07:08] Nuck: Haraka needs to be cut into chunks
[07:09] thepatr1ck: Nuck: I would never choose python/twisted (I'm just more comfortable with node.js)
[07:09] Nuck: Like, ingoing, outgoing, etc.
[07:09] wbednarski has joined the channel
[07:09] Nuck: And a module for SMTP and whatnot
[07:10] Nuck: Is there a library that it uses to handle the raw email protocols? That is, the server-to-server protocols, not SMTP or IMAP
[07:10] shanebo: nodemailer has an smtp moduleâ€¦ I wonder how hard it'd be to use that and hack something?
[07:10] Nuck: SMTP is outgoing only, shanebo
[07:10] Nuck: It communicates with a mail server to send emails
[07:10] Nuck: You'd need POP3 or IMAP for ingoing
[07:10] Nuck: Which is why I think Haraka should be split into chunks
[07:10] misterm: I used to have all sorts of fun with open SMTP servers, sigh

[07:11] Nuck: Centralization FTW
[07:11] misterm: for a long time hotmail did no SMTP auth, and they were like one of the biggest email providers, so much fun
[07:12] konobi: Nuck: server-to-server is still SMTP

[07:13] misterm: yea, smtp is still used
[07:13] konobi: Nuck: actually if you look over the history, it makes a bunch of sense
[07:13] misterm: but TLS is much more common now
[07:13] konobi: SMTP is _still_ SMTP
[07:13] Nuck: I thought SMTP was for communicating with a server to send an email
[07:13] konobi: TLS is just a transport mechanism
[07:14] mhauri has joined the channel
[07:14] misterm: konobi: of course
[07:14] konobi: Nuck: same... fucking... difference
[07:14] Nuck: I didn't know SMTP was also the protocol communicating with the recieving server
[07:14] misterm: konobi: what I'm saying is theres much more authentication now
[07:14] ivanfi has joined the channel
[07:14] konobi: misterm: TLS != auth
[07:14] misterm: konobi: everyone used to just leave their smtp servers open
[07:14] Nuck: haha yeah
[07:14] Nuck: TLS is encryption
[07:14] Nuck: Not authentication
[07:15] misterm: well whatever the auth they added on top is called
[07:15] Nuck: misterm: Do you mean you used to fake their SMTP packets to communicat with servers?
[07:15] konobi: k... i need to back away from this convo before i start flipping out... =0)
[07:15] konobi: misterm: SMTP-Auth
[07:15] Nuck: konobi: Don't worry, I don't even know what he's talking about
[07:15] Nuck: I still want to see REST become the new SMTP
[07:15] Nuck: That'd be epic
[07:15] konobi: never happen
[07:15] Nexxy: lolwat
[07:15] Nuck: Not in this day and age
[07:16] TheCode: So HTTP servers will now play the role of SMTP servers?
[07:16] Nexxy: thank god
[07:16] Nuck: But maybe if RESTful APIs were thought up long ago

[07:16] AAA_awright: I want to do away with servers
[07:16] konobi: shit, never, dies
[07:16] Nuck: REST > dnode for an API

[07:17] Nuck: konobi: I know, my dad used to work with mainframes :'(

[07:17] topaxi has joined the channel
[07:17] AvianFlu: lololol
[07:17] Nuck: DNode locks your client in
[07:17] AAA_awright: I want to do away with servers, and replace it with a p2p network, identifying destinations with public key hashesd
[07:17] Nexxy: lol
[07:17] konobi: Nuck: have a look at a language called 'H' =0)
[07:17] AvianFlu: "locks your client in"?
[07:17] Nuck: REST is way better
[07:17] Nuck: AvianFlu: DNode is in the same category as socket.io, realtime communications
[07:17] secoif: Nuck how often do you change that kind of stuff anyway
[07:18] Nuck: It's for RPC
[07:18] Nexxy: what do you think REST is for? ;o
[07:18] Nuck: And RPC is not great for outward-facing APIs
[07:18] AvianFlu: I mean, seriously
[07:18] Nuck: REST is a cleaner style of RPC
[07:18] Nuck: It treats things more as resources
[07:18] misterm: isn't dnode built on top of socket.io
[07:18] Nuck: Is it?
[07:18] Nexxy: I um... wow
[07:18] AvianFlu: you're invoking remote methods, I only see style differences past that
[07:18] Nuck: I thought it was a different approach to it
[07:18] misterm: I don't know, that's why I'm asking
[07:19] Nuck: AvianFlu: And REST is a better outward-facing style
[07:19] TheCode: dnode, I was looking for some XML snippet. I didn't find it, so it must be good.
[07:19] Nuck: It's easy as hell to implement in any language
[07:19] Nuck: DNode is a more specific thing
[07:19] Nexxy: lol
[07:19] Nexxy: every time I look in here
[07:19] Nuck: And that's why I argue that it's not right

[07:20] Nexxy: I'm starting to think you're serious
[07:20] Nexxy: lol
[07:20] Nuck: Dnode is a nice concept, I'll give it that, but it's not built for a request-response setup
[07:21] Nuck: That's what HTTP is for
[07:21] Nuck: It exists for a reason
[07:21] SubStack: Nuck: except for the part where REST is horrible for asynchronous requests
[07:22] Nuck: Howso?
[07:22] Nuck: SubStack: I see no reason why it's so bad
[07:22] SubStack: polling
[07:22] SubStack: polling is bad
[07:22] Nuck: That's not Async

[08:14] dexter_e_: weld FTW indeed

[08:17] jesusabdullah: shanebo: NEVERMIND
[08:17] AAA_awright: rmzg: About RDFa templates?
[08:17] jesusabdullah: rmzg: What about it? I missed that
[08:18] shanebo: jesusabdullah, I'm needing help with sending an email to a webserver which routes to a web app
[08:18] AAA_awright: http://magnode.org/rdfa-templating/ <-- Tada
[08:18] rmzg: AAA_awright: Yes!
[08:18] AAA_awright: rmzg: Are you familiar with RDF?
[08:18] rmzg: jesusabdullah: I was just wondering what the sanest way to combine it with express was
[08:18] rmzg: AAA_awright: I'm learning!
[08:18] jesusabdullah: shanebo: What now?
[08:18] AAA_awright: It's just a data model that makes statements about resources
[08:18] jesusabdullah: rmzg: Not sure! I find the hardest part server-side is juggling the jsdom
[08:19] AAA_awright: rmzg: Well the idea behind RDFa templates is you specify patterns that need to be filled with RDF facts from an RDFa data store
[08:19] jesusabdullah: since you want to share a single jsdom with all uses of your templating
[08:19] AAA_awright: So you don't need to pass any data to the template, it just fills itself out
[08:19] AAA_awright: Well, you pass the database, and a few arguments
[08:19] jesusabdullah: Bizarre
[08:19] AAA_awright: But you don't have to do any queries, the RDFa template engine does the queries for you
[08:19] radiodario: good morning
[08:19] dexter_e_: jesusabdullah: It sounds like you have experience with JSDOM, How do you manage the server-side embeded scripts colliding with browser-side intended scripts ?
[08:19] rmzg: AAA_awright: Sounds like php ^_^
[08:20] Nuck: AAA_awright: Sounds widly inefficient
[08:20] jesusabdullah: dexter_e_: What do you mean?
[08:20] TechCel has joined the channel
[08:20] AAA_awright: And the AWESOMELY COOL THING is that all the data that went into buildint the template, you can extract back from it and build the same data used to build it
[08:20] springmeyer has joined the channel
[08:20] rmzg: jesusabdullah: The example in the weld docs seem a little clumsy, loading the html file each time and so on, to be useful to render responses in Express
[08:20] dexter_e_: jesusabdullah:  JSDOM inserts script tags for the scripts used at server runtime right ?
[08:21] AAA_awright: Nuck: It's really not, at runtime it's as efficent as running the queries and passing the result to a template yourself
[08:21] kiffness has joined the channel
[08:21] jesusabdullah: AAA_awright: I've no promblem with rdf. I haven't really explored it and it seems like roughly 50% of semantic web ideas are stale now, but I suspect that's pretty neat
[08:21] AAA_awright: It's WICKED NEAT
[08:21] jesusabdullah: Yeah, I bet it pretty much *is* the query language AAA_awright 
[08:21] AAA_awright: I have a working example
[08:21] AAA_awright: Which is the basis of my CMS, http://magnode.org/
[08:21] rmzg: AAA_awright: Sure but how do you cache the queries?
[08:21] jesusabdullah: rmzg: so you're talking about server-side?
[08:21] AAA_awright: Uh, you don't really
[08:21] rmzg: 502 BAD GATEWAY

[08:22] jesusabdullah: well
[08:22] jesusabdullah: it's a dual-sided library silly!
[08:22] Nuck: I actually would bet that dumping a whole database to Node and querying in RDF is worse than querying through Mongo
[08:22] AAA_awright: Nuck: YOu don't dump the whole database, just the connection
[08:22] jesusabdullah: Unfortunately not browserify-able iirc (because of weld trixxx)
[08:22] Nuck: AAA_awright: Ah, so it queries for me?
[08:22] AAA_awright: Which, in the current state of my app, I am storing the database as a Javascript Object
[08:22] AAA_awright: Nuck: Yeah
[08:22] felixhummel has joined the channel

[08:23] AAA_awright: hmm
[08:23] AAA_awright: It would be a LOT more complex to do

[08:23] Orion-: Hello
[08:23] jesusabdullah: right?
[08:23] Nuck: hehe
[08:23] odyniec has joined the channel
[08:23] AAA_awright: But if you can extract RDF facts from MongoDB, and had all the right indexes on it, you could do it
[08:23] jesusabdullah: rmzg: No, it works in the browser, just not with the "browserify" tool
[08:23] rmzg: oh
[08:24] jesusabdullah: You load it directly
[08:24] Nuck: AAA_awright: I intend to do something like that for my client on my site
[08:24] AAA_awright: And as a bonus, you get semantically-rich webpages generated
[08:24] rmzg: What is browserify then?
[08:24] dexter_e: jesusabdullah: Just wondering how you bootstrap the script which modify your html  env or jsdom.jsdom ?
[08:24] Nuck: It's gonna generate a DOM, then insert the data
[08:24] AAA_awright: I seriously think this is how you're supposed to generate webpages
[08:24] AAA_awright: Like, the proper way to do so
[08:24] jesusabdullah: Oh, you use node code inside the jsdom
[08:24] Nuck: AAA_awright: I agree, but it seems like a heavier tool than I'd want
[08:24] rmzg: AAA_awright: That sounds awful similar to what these other examples are doing
[08:24] AAA_awright: It is heavy, but it's SO POWERFUL
[08:25] Nuck: I want something lightweight but easy to manage
[08:25] hellp has joined the channel
[08:25] rmzg: haha
[08:25] AAA_awright: It doesn't just generate webpages, it actually embeds the data inside the webpage, that was used to generate the webpage
[08:25] dexter_e: jesusabdullah:  are you using env() or jsdom.jsdom and createWindow()   ?
[08:25] AAA_awright: mind = blown
[08:25] jesusabdullah: env, yo
[08:25] kiffness_ has joined the channel
[08:25] Nuck: I'll probably write a setup that handles it for me in jQuery
[08:25] Nuck: I just provide a data object and a DOM node
[08:25] Orion-: Can anyone tell me if it's possible to get the memory address of an object in js to track memory leaks. I have a socket object but it seems to be duplicated after it's been re-assigned ?
[08:25] jesusabdullah: Think of it this way: All env does is pass a "window" object to a callback
[08:25] Nuck: And it'll insert the data into the DOM based on classes and such
[08:25] dexter_e: jesusabdullay: are you booting the scripts for modifying the dom inside the env() method ?
[08:26] jesusabdullah: it *just* implements the window object

[08:26] jesusabdullah: Wait, why?

[08:29] rmzg: Ohh
[08:29] shanebo: jQuery is terrible
[08:29] jesusabdullah: A word of warning, though: webscraping with jsdom is kinda slow
[08:29] rmzg: jesusabdullah: Is the env arguments importing libraries for use inside your window callback function?
[08:30] AAA_awright: rmzg: So wherever Jade encounters an undefined variable, it assumes it has to fill that in from the database
[08:30] jesusabdullah: rmzg: Yeah
[08:30] AAA_awright: And it uses the RDFa parser to figure out what triples it needs to query for
[08:30] dexter_e: jesusabdullah: With your current code, are you running into any problems with JSDOM inserting your <script> tags at the end of body ?
[08:30] jesusabdullah: So, if you load jquery, then window has a $ property
[08:30] Nuck: Fuck jsdom, just use phantomjs
[08:30] jesusabdullah: dexter_e: I haven't seen that, but who knows?
[08:30] Nuck: lol
[08:31] rmzg: Nuck: Elevator pitch for phantomjs, go
[08:31] rmzg: jesusabdullah: I see now.
[08:31] jesusabdullah: if you can make phantomjs do what you need it to do, by all means imo
[08:31] Nuck: rmzg: It's a full fucking browser on JS.

[08:32] jesusabdullah: Yeah, I don't really get it either dexter_e. Either you do everything client-side, or you do everything server-side
[08:32] jesusabdullah: either use weld to render client-side sent from a restful JSON interface, or use weld to render server-side before sending out
[08:33] dexter_e: rmzg: because certain things in client-side JS will behave differently, example stateChange -updates url bar,  stateChange calls tracking function etc. 
[08:33] rmzg: jesusabdullah: Reading the weld docs (over and over again) the main flaw seems to be how you specify which dom element to 'weld' against
[08:33] jesusabdullah: I believe phantomjs is a headless webkit browser designed for remote testing
[08:33] jesusabdullah: that's what I recall
[08:33] jesusabdullah: rmzg: You either have your element assigned to a handle when you create it, or you use the dom's built-in selectors to get the thing you want
[08:33] Nuck: that's what it is, but it's controlled in JS APIs
[08:34] kiffness has joined the channel
[08:34] rmzg: jesusabdullah: Right, but doing that without repeating a lot of ugly code seems tricky
[08:34] jesusabdullah: rmzg: Or, you add jquery to that array argument, and use window.$ to select
[08:34] kiffness_ has joined the channel
[08:34] Nuck: lol
[08:35] Nuck: Or QuerySelector
[08:35] dexter_e: jesusabdullah: Running the same set of JS files on server and client and after the app arrives in the browser it handles itself completely in the browser.
[08:35] Nuck: Does jsdom have that?
[08:35] jesusabdullah: yes
[08:35] rmzg: jesusabdullah: Surely you don't repeat the jsdom.env(... function() { ... window.fiddle.faddle( stuff ).bar } ) in every route
[08:35] jesusabdullah: that's what I was referring to
[08:35] Nuck: Then var $ = window.QuerySelector
[08:35] Nuck: And done
[08:35] jesusabdullah: rmzg: No, definitely not.
[08:35] jesusabdullah: rmzg: Like I said, that's the weird part
[08:35] rmzg: Well, yeah
[08:35] kiffness__ has joined the channel
[08:36] Nuck: That's the main thing I have against the DOM functions that are built-in
[08:36] Nuck: They're fucking /wordy/
[08:36] rmzg: jesusabdullah: So how do you handle that?
[08:36] jesusabdullah: rmzg: Just take the window object and toss it around
[08:36] Nuck: It reminds me of some site's TOS
[08:36] rmzg: hrm
[08:36] dexter_e: jesusabdullah: If thats the case, how do you ship you JS files to the browser? Just using what env() does automatically?
[08:36] jesusabdullah: dexter_e: What?
[08:36] rmzg: jesusabdullah: I'm wondering if you could just pass a series of data elements that describes the replacements necessary
[08:36] jesusabdullah: dexter_e: No, jsdom has nothing to do with client/server stuff
[08:36] dexter_e: where do you embed your JS files?
[08:36] rmzg: dexter_e: embed?
[08:36] Nuck: ooooh yeah
[08:36] jesusabdullah: What do you mean? Embed where?
[08:36] Nuck: SFTP is way better
[08:37] dexter_e: <script></script>
[08:37] Nuck: 1.5Mbps on average
[08:37] Nuck: At least
[08:37] dexter_e: how do you deliver your JS files to the browsr?
[08:37] rmzg: dexter_e: <script src=jquery.js> ?
[08:37] jesusabdullah: dexter_e: whose js files?
[08:37] Nuck: requirejs :D
[08:37] Nuck: lolno
[08:37] Nuck: I'll use headjs when I'm done
[08:37] dexter_e: JSDOM inserts <script></script> tags outside the body 
[08:38] dexter_e: do you just use the default <script> tags created by JSDOM to ship your JS to the browser ?
[08:38] Nuck: It's been one minute and I've already transferred over 100MB
[08:38] markwubben has joined the channel
[08:38] jesusabdullah: dexter_e: If you want to use jquery with jsdom, it's just an argument. If you want to serve code to the browser, either use express's static fileserver middleware, the static-server project or whatevs, apache, whatever
[08:38] Nuck: Thanks for suggesting I move to SFTP, this is WAY better
[08:38] rmzg: Nuck: That surprises me a little, is it just millions of tiny files?
[08:38] konobi: Nuck: netcat ftw!
[08:38] jesusabdullah: Or, use something like requirejs or browserify or whatever the fuck
[08:38] Nuck: rmzg: Mixture thereof
[08:38] Nuck: Some big, some small
[08:38] jesusabdullah: Nuck: Better n' ftp? No shit
[08:39] Nuck: In this case, it's about 3-4 files that are pretty big
[08:39] dexter_e: jesusabdullah:  I was under the impression you're using the same JS modules to handle HTML stateChange on the server as you do in the browser
[08:39] Nuck: Video files
[08:39] konobi: dexter_e: what's HTML?
[08:39] rmzg: dexter_e: I don't think that's what we're talking about!
[08:39] kulor-uk has joined the channel
[08:39] Nuck: I'm hitting 1.8Mbps on here at points
[08:39] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Better than SCP in this case
[08:39] Nuck: konobi: netcat? haha
[08:40] jesusabdullah: dexter_e: Are you suggesting that jsdom is allowing you to modify another browser's dom directly? If so, that's not the case.
[08:40] dexter_e: changing the state of the DOM before sending it to the browser
[08:40] jesusabdullah: jsdom only *implements* a DOM
[08:40] dmkbot: joyent/node: Nais: createContext/runInXXContext : "this" does not refer to the correct object - https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/1674
[08:40] jesusabdullah: If you want to use the results for the browser, use something like var html = element.innerHTML
[08:40] joeytwiddle has joined the channel
[08:40] Nuck: jsdom is *not* a templating engine
[08:40] jesusabdullah: that'll grab you the html source of everything inside that element
[08:41] Nuck: In fact, that's probably a really bad use for it
[08:41] jesusabdullah: Nuck: but weld *is*
[08:41] Nuck: It's not the fastest thing
[08:41] Nuck: jesusabdullah: That it is
[08:41] jesusabdullah: and it *requires* a DOM
[08:41] Nuck: haha true
[08:41] Nuck: But I'd rather use EJS
[08:41] Nuck: Faster than jsdom
[08:41] jesusabdullah: Agreement, though: It's a known problem that, while weld is elegant, it's limited by the speed of jsdom on the server
[08:41] Nuck: It's such a simple templating engine, EJS is.
[08:41] dexter_e: right,  I'm attempting to do what you're doing and run the same JS modules to modify the UI before its sent to the browser
[08:41] rmzg: Nuck: I'm completely tired of littering my html with ugly template calls
[08:42] jesusabdullah: I think the DOM guys have a point
[08:42] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Wonder if you could build a lighter way of representing the DOM?
[08:42] jesusabdullah: but I don't think microtemplating has lost the fight either
[08:42] Nuck: Like, just a simple JSON object
[08:42] jesusabdullah: Actually, we talked about that a little bit at summacamp
[08:42] jesusabdullah: Well, not a JSON object
[08:42] rmzg: Nuck: Surely there are optimizations available
[08:42] jesusabdullah: but there are a *lot* of DOM features weld doesn't need
[08:42] nyholt has joined the channel
[08:42] Nuck: I think a lighter representation of the DOM as a nested object could be better
[08:43] jesusabdullah: all well needs are queryselectors, really
[08:43] AAA_awright: You can't "compile" weld?
[08:43] kiffness has joined the channel
[08:43] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Haha, and that's pretty slow
[08:43] konobi: jesusabdullah: ctemplate ftw?
[08:43] AAA_awright: My JadeRDFa compiles to code
[08:43] jesusabdullah: AAA_awright: Not with browserify, no
[08:43] dexter_e: If you spawn an instance of window with your UI running on the server you have the option to automatically add scripts in context of the new window, but those scripts end up inserted outside the body of the outgoing html.. 
[08:43] Nuck: Maybe optimize for class-based selectors?
[08:43] jesusabdullah: I dunno
[08:43] jesusabdullah: I'm not the DOM implementation guy, tmpvar is
[08:43] jesusabdullah: haha!
[08:44] jesusabdullah: I looked at that code once, shat bricks and ran away
[08:44] jesusabdullah: Implementing a DOM is hard as fuck
[08:44] Nuck: jesusabdullah: I think a very lightweight DOM setup (a JSON object would suffice, IMO), would be enough for a QuerySelector
[08:44] dexter_e: jesusabdullah: How do you pass data into your UI modification function while still on the server?
[08:44] Nuck: Just iterate over the JSON and find it, etc.
[08:44] jesusabdullah: Why JSON? Just use an Actual Object
[08:44] rmzg: dexter_e: What on earth are you talking about?
[08:44] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Well, yeah
[08:44] Nuck: jesusabdullah: JSON is an Object to me
[08:44] shanebo: guys download mootools and quit floundering aboutâ€¦ ;)

[08:44] Nuck: Fuck mootools >:C
[08:45] robi42 has joined the channel
[08:45] Nuck: I used that
[08:45] justinTNT has joined the channel
[08:45] Nuck: Then I ceded defeat and moved to jQuery
[08:45] Nuck: And never looked back
[08:45] shanebo: jQuery is disgusting
[08:45] dexter_e: Don't you need data from your database to insert into your html template before its sent?
[08:45] shanebo: can't believe people use it
[08:45] phree: *knockknock*  I'm trying to get started... npm freezes http://jsfiddle.net/TYyqp/
[08:45] konobi: xui ftw
[08:45] jesusabdullah: dexter_e: If you're using jsdom to modify some html before serving it, all you can do is innerHTML some HTML source in, innerHTML the modified source code BACK OUT, and then SERVE THAT ON PORT 80
[08:45] Nuck: Not nearly as nasty as prototype
[08:45] shanebo: fair enoughâ€¦ that's why i recommended mootools
[08:45] jesusabdullah: If you want to modify the DOM on the browser, you need to ask THAT question and ignore jsdom completely
[08:46] Nexxy: shanebo, did someone wake up on the wrong side of the client side js library this morning?
[08:46] shanebo: no
[08:46] Nuck: mootools modifies prototypes too, shanebo
[08:46] shanebo: :)
[08:46] shanebo: Nuck, true
[08:46] Nuck: So no thanks
[08:46] konobi: shanebo: try xui =0)
[08:46] jesusabdullah: Guys, guys!
[08:46] Nuck: konobi: TRY YUI
[08:46] Nuck: :D
[08:46] Nuck: Can we all agree to hate YUI?
[08:46] dexter_e: jesusadbdullah: whoa.. Thanks :)
[08:46] konobi: http://xuijs.com/
[08:46] Nuck: I mean, shit, have you *seen* the syntax on that?
[08:46] dexter_e: I thought you could do full on HTML state change in JSDOM before its shipped
[08:47] konobi: deisgned for mobile, but mice to use in refular browsers
[08:47] jesusabdullah: jquery is easy to get a grip on, has some nice selectors, and is fairly ubiquitous. On the other hand, its method chaining can lead to obnoxiously weird code
[08:47] Nuck: I mostly use jQuery for the shortened versions of various functions
[08:47] jesusabdullah: I think we can ALL agree on that.
[08:47] jesusabdullah: Also, it's a kitchen sink.
[08:47] Nuck: Main thing is .bind() versus .addEventListener
[08:47] Nuck: I personally prefer .on() though
[08:47] shanebo: Nuck, and not extending prototypes is why jQuery is so nastyâ€¦ because you have to cobble a bunch of code together that wasn't designed holistically
[08:47] rmzg: jesusabdullah: I'm thinking you can just pass weld something like { "css selector", { data:stuff, here } }
[08:47] Nuck: If somebody made a lighter DOM wrapper that provided that shorthand without adding chaining, I would SO use it
[08:48] rmzg: jesusabdullah: Which means your view just has to construct a 'struct' to pass to the view
[08:48] Nuck: shanebo: I disagree
[08:48] rmzg: hrtm
[08:48] Nuck: I also like the way jQuery works on arrays of DOM nodes
[08:48] Nuck: That's a wonderful concept
[08:48] rmzg: This ties my views a little too much to the html..
[08:48] Nuck: But it's just way too heavyweight
[08:48] dexter_e: I was trying to use JSDOM to spawn an entire instance of my browser-application on the server, change its state based on url params and them ship it out to browser, after that it continues to change its own state with no further requests to server
[08:48] rmzg: WHY IS TEMPLATING HARD
[08:48] Nuck: The chaining is a horrible thing too
[08:48] rmzg: Let's go shopping
[08:48] Nuck: I've stopped doing chaining mostly
[08:49] AAA_awright: DIE DIE DIE
[08:49] shanebo: rmzg front-end or backend?
[08:49] jesusabdullah: rmzg: that's pretty much how it works, right?
[08:49] AAA_awright: function.chaining.die.die.die
[08:49] jesusabdullah: You pass it an element and an object
[08:49] Nuck: I use jQuery like I would use similar DOM functions
[08:49] konobi: "Bill paxton mostly dies in his movies, mostly"
[08:49] rmzg: jesusabdullah: Not exactly, you still have to do all of the node selection.. yeah
[08:49] rmzg: You have to get the element
[08:49] rmzg: Then call weld
[08:49] jesusabdullah: I like method chaining but NESTED method chaining can be dangerous.
[08:49] Nuck: So it's really great code that results from it
[08:49] rmzg: shanebo: Backend

[08:49] rmzg: On an unrelated note, tamejs looks awesome
[08:49] shanebo: use mustache
[08:50] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Not really, the problem is that chaining results in a LOT of unmodular code
[08:50] shanebo: rmzg I agree!
[08:50] Nuck: I think some things are fine when chained, like setting CSS and HTML, but event stuff?
[08:50] Nuck: Eh, no
[08:50] rmzg: shanebo: I hate having my html full of {fucking} {ugly} {replacements}

[08:52] Nuck: It is
[08:52] Nuck: I built a RESTful API for my site, and I'll be building a frontend over it
[08:52] Nexxy: so serve html structure + json content + logic
[08:52] Nuck: Msotly using jQuery how it *ought* to be used
[08:53] AAA_awright: rmzg: What else do you use then/
[08:53] Nexxy: and you just made a client-rendered "template"

[08:55] noodlehaus: guys how do you debug with coffeescript?
[08:55] Nexxy: LOL
[08:55] jesusabdullah: the weld side idk as much, but the html side is great
[08:55] jesusabdullah: noodlehaus: I program in javascript.
[08:55] Nexxy: noodlehaus, with lots of stress balls and holes in the drywall?
[08:55] jesusabdullah: noodlehaus: PROBLEM SOLVED!
[08:55] justinTNT: I like the weld philosophy.
[08:55] noodlehaus: hahaha
[08:55] Nexxy: what jesusabdullah said
[08:55] industrial: noodlehaus: mostly, look at the js output file to check the line number, find the equivalent piece of CS code, change it, rinse repeat
[08:55] noodlehaus: ok, i was thinking of giving the thing a try :D
[08:55] Nexxy: don't
[08:55] Nuck: noodlehaus: It's really easy, you switch to JS.
[08:55] Nexxy: do us all a favor
[08:55] rmzg: AAA_awright: Well, maybe, that is a downside
[08:55] dexter_e: jesusabdullah: Do you use JSDOM to insert data into your html templates on the server ?
[08:55] jesusabdullah: but seriously, you just have to look at the raw javascript for debugging either way
[08:55] noodlehaus: i had the same thoughts for using it on the front-end, realized firebug and the chrome console don't do coffee
[08:55] shanebo: we all agree on something!

[09:04] Nuck: AAA_awright: Didn't know my server supported SFTP
[09:04] industrial: javaanse_jongens: lol @ your name.
[09:04] industrial: I smoke you.
[09:04] AAA_awright: Nuck: It's a part of SSH, of course it does
[09:04] AAA_awright: It connects port 22 and everything
[09:04] Nuck: AAA_awright: I didn't know that before
[09:04] Nuck: I screwed it up with SSH-FTP tunnelling
[09:05] Nuck: Which is *also* called SFTP
[09:05] AAA_awright: Oooohhhhh, that's different
[09:05] Nuck: Yeah
[09:05] shanebo: good night folks
[09:05] shanebo: im out
[09:05] Nuck: I think my confusion there makes a bit of sense
[09:05] AAA_awright: No it isn't. It's SSH-FTP
[09:05] Nuck: haha yeah
[09:05] Nuck: AAA_awright: Really?
[09:05] Nuck: hmm
[09:05] AAA_awright: If someone's calling ssh-ftp sftp, they're calling it wrong
[09:05] Nuck: I remember there was an FTP variant that was named SFTP
[09:05] Nuck: I know FTPS is TLS+FTP
[09:06] Nuck: And then there was another thing for SFTP that caused me to get confused
[09:06] radiodario has left the channel
[09:06] AAA_awright: Wikipedia even titles it: FTP over SSH (not SFTP)
[09:06] AAA_awright: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol#FTP_over_SSH_.28not_SFTP.29
[09:07] Nuck: hahaha
[09:07] Nuck: That's a great title
[09:07] Nuck: Then it was another protocol
[09:07] Nuck: There's so many .*FTP.*
[09:08] AAA_awright: It's near impossible to tunnel FTP natively over SSH because it uses two TCP connections, anyways
[09:08] AAA_awright: So I have no clue what you were doing, maybe it was scp, but some weird filesystem inefficency
[09:08] Nuck: Oh, it was SCP
[09:09] Nuck: I'm using WinSCP and I had selected SCP
[09:09] AAA_awright: Huh
[09:09] Nuck: Now I'm on SFTP
[09:09] Nuck: SFTP is great at transferring lots of small files at a time
[09:09] Nuck: I'm actually quite impressed
[09:10] Glenjamin: sounds like a job for rsync!
[09:10] Nuck: lol
[09:10] Nuck: Windows-to-Linux, nothx
[09:10] Nuck: I'm kinda stuck with what WinSCP supports
[09:10] Glenjamin: git
[09:10] Nuck: hahaha
[09:10] Glenjamin: oh actually, git on windows sux
[09:10] Nuck: binaries
[09:11] AAA_awright: Glenjamin: Not when I used it 2-3 years ago
[09:11] Nuck: Oh, it does
[09:11] Nuck: It's awful
[09:11] Glenjamin: horrible
[09:11] AAA_awright: I think you're using it wrong
[09:11] Nuck: I use TortoiseGit primarily because of that
[09:11] Glenjamin: there's still no proper native git on windows
[09:11] Nuck: It works, but the difference in filesystems and the bad integration into the OS
[09:11] AAA_awright: You want TortoiseGit with msysgit
[09:11] Nuck: It just kills it
[09:11] Glenjamin: msysgit is sloooooow
[09:11] Nuck: TortoiseGit with msysgit, yup
[09:11] Nuck: That's what I've got
[09:12] AAA_awright: Huh
[09:12] Glenjamin: it "works", but its still rubbish
[09:12] Nuck: Actually maybe not
[09:12] Glenjamin: compared to git on a  posix system
[09:12] AAA_awright: I sync my entire home directory thay way
[09:12] Nuck: I might be using Plink
[09:12] jesusabdullah: I run git from command line in windows
[09:12] AAA_awright: Well compared to that, everything is slower on windows
[09:12] Nuck: Because all my keys are in PuTTY
[09:12] jesusabdullah: even thought it sucks
[09:12] jesusabdullah: I fucking know how to use it, and I hate windows anyway
[09:12] AAA_awright: Nuck: That shouldn't affect file transfer

[09:13] Nuck: Where is my keychain in Ubuntu?
[09:14] Glenjamin: plenty of things are just as fast on windows, just not things written specifically for posix calls with no abstraction layer that have to rely on some sort of emulation (msys/cygwin)
[09:14] Nuck: erm
[09:14] Nuck: msys isn't emulation
[09:14] Nuck: is it?
[09:14] AAA_awright: What do you mean by emulation?
[09:15] Nuck: I thought msys was Linux tools ported to Windows?
[09:15] AAA_awright: Yeah
[09:15] aaronmcadam has joined the channel
[09:15] AAA_awright: Kinda
[09:15] Nuck: I thought it was actual PORTS and not EMULATIONS
[09:15] Nuck: Unlike Cygwin
[09:15] AAA_awright: msys is related to cygwin
[09:15] AAA_awright: somehow
[09:16] Nuck: I don't think so
[09:16] Glenjamin: afaik it's a bit similar, they'd have to implement the usual posix C system calls using underlying windows APIs
[09:16] AAA_awright: One is a compiler, one is an enviornment or something which you compile with or something
[09:16] AAA_awright: I use it myself I should know the difference

[09:20] Nuck: feature detection?
[09:21] Nuck: Though
[09:21] Nuck: I guess it does make sense
[09:21] Nuck: Since you need to design different UIs for the various devices
[09:21] Nuck: I would still like a one-size-fits-all too
[09:21] Glenjamin: feature detection requires loading some part to do the detection as well, which is a luxury you dont have on mobile

[09:51] jetienne_: micro library to handle events in any javascript object
[09:51] dexter_e: jetienne: Nope checking it out now! thanks.
[09:51] Nuck: I would just use an EventEmitter

[09:52] SubStack: Glenjamin: it's running in #stackvm right now

[09:52] jesusabdullah: I thought that was peteris
[09:53] SubStack: Nuck: eh?
[09:53] Glenjamin: JS Date has an awful api
[09:53] Nuck: I agree
[09:53] jesusabdullah: It could be worse
[09:53] Nexxy: I wrote a date/time module in js
[09:53] jesusabdullah: it could have jslint's api
[09:53] SubStack: Nuck: what am I forgetting?
[09:53] Nuck: SubStack: That JS had Date()
[09:53] Nuck: And then built a Date module
[09:53] SubStack: I never did that

[09:54] jesusabdullah: Shame on you.
[09:54] Nuck: ACTION has too many half-finished modules lying around
[09:54] jesusabdullah: Here'w what you should do:
[09:54] jesusabdullah: 1) Look up trollcode
[09:54] jesusabdullah: 2) Fork my brainfuck module
[09:54] jesusabdullah: 3) publish trollcode module
[09:55] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Better idea, brainfuck templates
[09:55] jesusabdullah: Alternately, regexp a string into brainfuck
[09:55] jesusabdullah: and then use my module as a dep
[09:55] jesusabdullah: actually, that regexp sounds easy
[09:56] jesusabdullah: Screw you, it will be mine!
[09:56] Nuck: It wouldn't actually be templates, just a brainfuck program that generates the page's HTML

[10:15] dexter_e: Nuck: Thanks! :)
[10:16] dexter_e: in ruby I'm used to models just having properties which can be accessed ,  is it possible to do that in node?
[10:16] Nuck: uh, dunno
[10:16] Nuck: I guess it's theoretically possible
[10:16] Nuck: Maybe
[10:16] Nuck: Not easily
[10:16] dexter_e:     For example:    userModel.firstName  
[10:17] Nuck: Might be possible, might not be
[10:17] socketio\test\55 has joined the channel
[10:18] dob_ has joined the channel
[10:18] dexter_e: So all models used in node apps use even callback property accessors?
[10:18] dexter_e: *event
[10:19] Nuck: I don't use explicit MVC, but I'd assume so.
[10:19] SubStack: dexter_e: false
[10:19] Nuck: Orly?
[10:19] SubStack: node has no conception of "model"
[10:19] Glenjamin: does anyone have an idea how to make property getters work with async?
[10:19] Nuck: haha
[10:19] SubStack: node is just a wrapper around v8 to do disk and network i/o
[10:19] dexter_e: Glenjamin: Thats what I'm wondering too! 
[10:19] SubStack: node is not rails
[10:20] Nuck: Agreed
[10:20] Nuck: Node is *not* rails
[10:20] Nuck: And I'm damn glad
[10:20] Glenjamin: we could build node on nails
[10:20] dexter_e: So to have abstract models with convenient property access.. is there a convention to achieve that?
[10:21] Glenjamin: .get('prop', cb) is probably as clean as you can get easily
[10:21] Nuck: Erm, many of us don't use models that explicityly
[10:21] SamuraiJack has joined the channel
[10:21] Nuck: The closest you'll get (that's popular) is something like Mongoose.
[10:21] Glenjamin: unless you load the objects async and assume once loaded properties exist
[10:21] Nuck: Glenjamin: That's the only other option
[10:22] Nuck: Unless you decided to do futures
[10:22] Nuck: Then you've got 500 new headaches to deal with
[10:22] Glenjamin: My current system has "factories" for loading and fetching parent/child elements
[10:22] Nuck: I just do callbacks
[10:22] Nuck: It's easiest
[10:23] SubStack: Second.
[10:23] Nuck: And I just do wrappers around Mongo
[10:23] Glenjamin: Post.fetch(id, function(err, post) {/* ... */ });
[10:23] Glenjamin: post.fetchParent(function(err, parent) { /* .. */ });

[10:23] Nuck: It's just kinda weird when you only have M and V
[10:23] Nuck: Err
[10:23] Nuck: M
[10:23] Nuck: Really
[10:24] Nuck: It's an API
[10:24] abraxas has joined the channel
[10:24] Nuck: I'd like to see the MVC layout for something which takes DB calls and turns them into JSON
[10:25] dexter_e: Glenjamin: .get('prop', cb)     wow really ?
[10:25] neilk_ has joined the channel
[10:26] Nuck: You get used to callbacks
[10:26] Nuck: They grow on ya
[10:26] Nuck: It can take a while for some people
[10:26] Glenjamin: depends if you want sync property access to behave the same as async (ie, fk relations)
[10:26] Nuck: I couldn't comprehend them until I had the revelation of scopes
[10:27] dexter_e: So theres no way to   model.init( state , callback ) and then    just access model.prop provided init ran first ?
[10:27] Nuck: Uh, no.
[10:27] Glenjamin: that was the other suggestion i made
[10:27] nyholt has joined the channel
[10:27] Nuck: Wait, yes
[10:27] Nuck: The callback on init, yes
[10:27] Glenjamin: but for example post.comments in rails would fire off a DB call to load the comments
[10:27] Nuck: Everything would be in there though
[10:28] dexter_e: Glenjamin: Good point 
[10:28] Nuck: dexter_e: Any place that it interfaces with a database, that'll have a callback
[10:29] Nuck: My folder structure has begun to get unwieldy, I'll probably be figuring out something a lot more rigid soon
[10:29] Nuck: I doubt it'll be MVC
[10:29] dexter_e: At a certain point though the primary utility of a Model is to abstract away the details of data access, I just wonder if Node has established any kind of convention for this abstraction , in light of its event based nature.
[10:29] Nuck: Since that sucks ass for this use case
[10:29] mquin has joined the channel
[10:29] Nuck: dexter_e: Yup, we can wrap 15 callbacks into one
[10:29] Nuck: We call that abstracting
[10:30] Nuck: In Node, we try to avoid uneccessary abstractions
[10:30] Nuck: In fact, that should be our motto
[10:30] Nuck: "Avoid Uneccessary Abstractions"
[10:30] deimos_ has joined the channel
[10:30] Nuck: It's got a nice ring to it.
[10:30] dexter_e: well Abstraction is one of the 4 pillars of object oriented programming
[10:30] Nuck: eeeeeeh I wouldn't go that far
[10:31] Nuck: abstraction is important, but some things take it too far
[10:31] Nuck: coughcough ruby
[10:31] dexter_e: its not me, its every oop book ever written
[10:31] Nuck: dexter_e: Just look at the environment on NodeJS.  We're barely abstracted over the raw POSIX calls
[10:31] Nuck: The only abstractions are to deal with differences in setups
[10:32] dexter_e: I see. I suppose in some cases its key not to abstract too much
[10:32] robhawkes has joined the channel
[10:32] Nuck: Wrapping 10 callbacks into one, that's usually enough
[10:33] Nuck: You can make a simple way to get a user from the database, which might take 15 callbacks nested, and reuse that
[10:33] dominictarr has joined the channel
[10:33] Nuck: But we keep data access async for the sake of, well, asynchronousness
[10:33] industrial: for the sake of controlling serial vs paralel at will
[10:34] Nuck: haha that too
[10:34] industrial: which makes it faster most of the times then just serial
[10:35] Nuck: Most of my code is serial, but because it's async serial, it's able to take more connections in that time

[10:36] dexter_e: Glenjamin: This sounds interesting, are these factories event based ?

[10:40] dexter_e:  model.init( sessionState , modelReady );     function modelReady( model ){   model.prop;  model.prop2;  };      Anyone see a problem with this? I'm new.  
[10:41] Nuck: dexter_e: Yup
[10:41] Nuck: If you call on model.prop1 and model.prop2 before it's loaded
[10:41] Nuck: Which will likely happen since you're using a callback there
[10:41] Nuck: You'd hafta nest everything in the callback
[10:41] dexter_e: Nuck:  modelReady IS the loaded callback 
[10:42] Nuck: yup

[10:42] nail_ has joined the channel

[10:42] dexter_e: right the last model.prop would fail
[10:42] Nuck: model.prop will be undefined
[10:42] dexter_e: I know
[10:42] Nuck: Yup
[10:43] Nuck: That's the thing, this isn't really abstracting, persay
[10:43] Nuck: You're abstracting the abstraction, and now you have two problems
[10:43] Nuck: And you can't load your entire database one time
[10:44] dexter_e: Great point. 
[10:44] dexter_e: But we have to assume your models would load only the necessary relevant data based on session state.
[10:44] Nuck: Uh
[10:44] Nuck: sessions?
[10:44] Nuck: hehehe
[10:44] Nuck: There's no such concept in Node
[10:45] dexter_e: Are you using express ?
[10:45] Nuck: We have global to the entire server and then we have requests
[10:45] dexter_e: I'm using express
[10:45] Nuck: sessions are just JSON objects
[10:45] Nuck: And they too are shoved in a database
[10:45] neilk_ has joined the channel
[10:46] dexter_e: yeah I'm using the word 'session' generally 
[10:46] Nuck: dexter_e: Anyways, you generally query the database to retrieve data that needs to be retrieved
[10:46] Nuck: Based on the current request
[10:47] Nuck: My "model" (if you can call it that) consists of functions like users.getUser()
[10:47] Nuck: Err, addUser
[10:47] dexter_e: Right, but once an application gets large enough if you must manage the details of each db connection and query directly it might become hard to manage. 
[10:48] Nuck: manage the details of each db connection?
[10:48] Nuck: Keep a pool
[10:48] Nuck: round robin
[10:48] Nuck: I merely have wrappers around queries
[10:48] Nuck: And Mongo is async by nature
[10:48] dexter_e: I mean large enough in terms of code complexity , not scale :)  I'm just a one box guy. 
[10:49] Nuck: Managing the details of a db connection?
[10:49] Nuck: Hell, I just store one connection globally
[10:49] Nuck: everything runs on that
[10:49] Nuck: And I just wrap queries into single functions
[10:50] Nuck: Which have a callback
[10:50] Nuck: instead of 5-6 nested callbacks
[10:50] JakeyChan_ has joined the channel
[10:50] dexter_e: all your queries go through one function ?
[10:50] dexter_e: to mongo ?
[10:50] Nuck: Not one function
[10:50] rmzg: TO THE MONGO
[10:50] Nuck: One connection
[10:50] rmzg: Nuck: Why not multiple connections?
[10:50] Nuck: rmzg: I'm gonna add pooling later
[10:51] rmzg: Ah
[10:51] rmzg: Nuck: Node is completely single process right, nothing ever forks or threads?
[10:51] Nuck: yup
[10:51] Nuck: Well
[10:51] radiodario: well you can do popen that opens a process
[10:51] rmzg: Simple enough
[10:51] Nuck: There is a threadpool
[10:51] rmzg: -_-
[10:52] Nuck: but that's used for when it can't do something async through a POSIX call
[10:52] Nuck: It has those there to fake async
[10:52] rmzg: yup
[10:52] rmzg: Nuck: Do you use any flow control type libraries/
[10:52] Charuru has joined the channel
[10:52] Nuck: I use the async utilities of async.js
[10:52] Nuck: Not the flow control, generally, though
[10:52] dexter_e: So   .get('prop', callback)  is the consensus for model.property  access in node  yeah?
[10:53] Nuck: dexter_e: Something like that, yes
[10:53] rmzg: Callbacks everywhere!
[10:53] Nuck: although many noders choose not to do a rigid MVC
[10:54] Nuck: I think part of what made Node big was that it fed on the reaction to the rigidity of Ruby
[10:55] Nuck: It fit in with the great pendulum of programming

[11:24] Nuck: That's my improvement
[11:24] rmzg: Ok, what should I use?
[11:24] Nuck: Node
[11:25] Nuck: Good ol' Vanilla Node.js
[11:25] SubStack: rmzg: there are lots of ways to structure asynchronous flow control
[11:25] Nuck: It's really not that bad
[11:25] Nuck: When you get used to it
[11:25] rmzg: Nuck: Yeah, it is
[11:25] Nexxy: rmzg, if you're really just looking for a fancy flow control lib use async
[11:25] SubStack: EventEmitters, named function, flow control libs like step
[11:25] Nuck: yup
[11:25] SubStack: async too
[11:25] Nuck: There's far better ways
[11:26] Glenjamin: with async from npm
[11:26] rmzg: This is a flow control lib like step, and appears to be better
[11:26] booo has joined the channel
[11:26] rmzg: But how is async an improvement?
[11:26] Glenjamin: it abstracts common patterns
[11:26] Nexxy: async.parallel(), async.series()
[11:26] SubStack: rmzg: tame isn't a flow control lib, it's a source transformer

[11:31] rmzg: The design.
[11:31] Nexxy: deep nesting = you're doing it wrong
[11:31] Nuck: nested makes me happier than tame
[11:31] Nuck: And I only nest maybe 4 deep at any given time
[11:32] Nuck: Before taking a reusable chunk
[11:32] Nuck: And splitting it into a separate function
[11:32] Nuck: With one callback
[11:32] Raynos: Dont nest too far
[11:32] rmzg: s

[11:32] Raynos: two or three is ok
[11:32] Nuck: Callbacks are only bad *if you don't know whate you're doing*
[11:32] rmzg: No one said callbacks are bad.
[11:32] Nuck: If you learn to use callbacks, they're quite nice
[11:32] Raynos: I'll rewrite that code into something readable
[11:33] rmzg: And the argument that "learning to use something solves its problems" is the most idiotic lie in computer science and single handedly holding back progress.
[11:33] Nexxy: callbacks stole my date to the prom

[11:42] Raynos: async & futures are quite good
[11:42] tuhoojabotti: I use that too.

[11:42] tuhoojabotti: Should use it on the server too
[11:43] Raynos: rmzg: middleware : https://github.com/Raynos/middleware but it's a work in progress
[11:43] rmzg: Raynos: So the question becomes, what's the advantage of using middleware over tamejs? I rather like the tame syntax and it has some benefits beyond the example you've rewritten
[11:43] Raynos: tame is an abstraction that abstracts away the fact all your communication and actions are asynchronous
[11:43] Raynos: First of all it compiles down to javascript
[11:43] Raynos: So you have the standard problems with debugging compiled javascript
[11:44] Raynos: secondly it makes you feel that actions are synchronous when they are not.
[11:44] Raynos: this will lead to bad code
[11:44] Raynos: It basically makes you think its doing something else then it is and it makes it easier to make architecture design mistakes
[11:44] rmzg: Well, it's a reasonable argument
[11:44] Raynos: I highly recommend against it
[11:44] rmzg: Raynos: Are you by any chance familiar with POE or uh Twisted or similar?
[11:44] Nuck: Honestly, tamejs isn't a bad *idea*
[11:44] Nuck: I don't blame them for that
[11:45] Nuck: But the execution gets a 3/10

[11:45] Raynos: It also introduces new syntax into javascript
[11:45] Raynos: I hate new syntax because its not portable
[11:45] Raynos: its a pain in the ass for anyone to read who doesnt know tamejs
[11:45] Raynos: and its a pain to maintain
[11:45] Raynos: For the love of god never use it in a library because it infuriates anyone whos willing to make open source contributions to your library
[11:46] rmzg: heh
[11:46] Nuck: (1) the compiler is complete and utter shit (2) you can have glitches in *their compiler* that break *your code* (3) everything Raynos has sead
[11:46] Raynos: But in applications you have your own choice of flow control
[11:46] Nuck: Raynos: Haha, same thing with CoffeeScript
[11:46] rmzg: I'd agree with you as to the general points of source code compilation, but the advantages it offers seem to outweigh most of the negatives
[11:46] Raynos: Nuck: is storm better?
[11:46] Nuck: Storm?
[11:46] Raynos: https://github.com/guileen/stormjs
[11:46] Raynos: Same idea, slightly different syntax / implementation
[11:47] Nuck: I'd hafta see before and after code
[11:47] Raynos: its on their github page
[11:47] Raynos: I still highly recommend against it.
[11:47] Raynos: It's black magic and a leaky abstraction
[11:47] Nuck: I think the best way to do flow control is to use futures
[11:47] Raynos: and I hate leaky abstractions

[11:48] Nuck: Though I use Mongoskin for the basic futures 
[11:48] Raynos: erlang does continuation passing where its easier to write async
[11:48] Nuck: Where sync would actually be best, it uses futures

[11:55] Raynos: it makes me sad
[11:55] Nuck: character limit?
[11:55] Raynos: Yes
[11:55] Nuck: I use word wrap
[11:55] Raynos: like 100 or 120char
[11:55] Nuck: lol
[11:55] Raynos: Or 80 if your hardcore
[11:55] Nuck: OMGOMGOMGOM
[11:56] Nuck: I"M GETTING A FACT FROM @WeAreFact
[11:56] Raynos: ._.
[11:56] Nuck: About @WeAreFact
[11:56] Raynos: Who are they
[11:56] Raynos: why would I care
[11:56] Nuck: Twitter account
[11:57] Nuck: They come up with ridiculous, uh, "facts"
[11:57] Raynos: I saw it. I dont care
[11:57] Raynos: You have internet problems
[11:57] Nuck: I wanted to see if they'd do it
[11:57] Nuck: And factception me
[11:57] Nuck: Anyways, I don't bother with silly formatting things that are holdouts from old editors that didn't do word wrapping
[11:58] paulwe has joined the channel
[11:58] Raynos: I dont like word wrapping

[12:05] Glenjamin: Nuck: it's the same reason newspapers write text in columns
[12:05] Glenjamin: long lines are harder to read
[12:06] Glenjamin: applies to programming also - if you can't fit it into 80 chars it should probably be refactored
[12:06] Nuck|mobile: I'm a strong believer in adaptive codebases. I use tabs because every dev can set a width for that
[12:06] Glenjamin: and word wrapping screws up indents
[12:06] icebox has joined the channel
[12:06] Nuck|mobile: And I don't wrap lines because I expect the dev to have an editor that does word wrapping
[12:06] Nuck|mobile: In a way that doesn't suck
[12:07] Glenjamin: tabs i can live with, but lots of chars/tokens on a line or > 4/5 indents is a bad code smell imo
[12:07] Glenjamin: In a team of ~20 or so, I'm the only one who sticks strongly to 80 chars :(
[12:07] Nuck: Haha well, I expect each dev to set their styles on their editor, not in the codebases
[12:08] Nuck: I think it's a fairly logical thing
[12:08] Nexxy: 80 chars is more of a common courtesy than a style
[12:08] Glenjamin: when a line starts at columns 35, and contains a 40 character class name
[12:08] Glenjamin: you know its a bad line :(
[12:08] Raynos: Glenjamin: 80 is too little with 4 or 8 character tabs.
[12:08] Glenjamin: but thats a language issue more than a style issue
[12:08] Nuck: Haha well if you use 2-width indents it's not so bad
[12:09] Glenjamin: Raynos: not if you don't overnest!
[12:09] Nuck: Raynos: Exactly lol
[12:09] SubStack: I do 4 space indents at 80 chars
[12:09] Nuck: Nesting happens, it's to be expected
[12:09] Raynos: I do recommend 100 or 120
[12:09] Raynos: I have big trouble fitting unit tests in 80 characters
[12:09] Raynos: because assert messages are verbose and descriptive
[12:09] Glenjamin: it's a bit harder in node with all the callbacks, but perfectly reasonable
[12:09] Nuck: I'm probably gonna move to 3-width indents soon
[12:09] Glenjamin: the entire python stdlib is 80 char max with 4 space indents
[12:09] Nuck: I'd rather nest than deal with named functions
[12:10] Nuck: That just makes my code look messy
[12:10] Raynos: Tbh nesting isnt that bad.
[12:10] Nuck: And clouds the flow
[12:10] Glenjamin: Raynos: break strings over multiple lines, use intermediary variables to assemble etc
[12:10] Nuck: I agree, people make such big deal over nesting
[12:10] Raynos: Glenjamin: still 80 characters is silly these days.
[12:10] Nuck: Glenjamin: I build for speed.
[12:10] Glenjamin: sometimes its fine, often its ugly ime
[12:10] Nuck: Okay that was axle 
[12:11] Raynos: 80char was because o terminals at fixed width
[12:11] Nuck: A lie, even
[12:11] Raynos: we can lax it to 100 or 120
[12:11] Glenjamin: except then you can't fit 2 files side by side on a widescreen
[12:11] Raynos: I can
[12:11] Raynos: @ 100
[12:11] Nuck: Raynos: Yeah it's a holdout from old consoles
[12:11] Raynos: I can fit two @ 120, and 3 at 80
[12:11] Nuck: I don't do side by side on one screen
[12:11] Glenjamin: and like i said, the limit isn't about screen space - it's about cognitive load per line
[12:11] SubStack: 80 characters is a nice reminder not to drift too far to the right
[12:11] Nuck: I dual screen
[12:11] Raynos: Get a decent 1920px screen
[12:11] dexter_e: Glenjamin: did you check out the node-proxy link ?
[12:11] Glenjamin: save your eyes, increase the font size
[12:11] Raynos: Glenjamin: depends on how far you indent
[12:12] Glenjamin: dexter_e: yeah, but i don't really want to use fibers
[12:12] Glenjamin: i'm thinking about switching to 2-space in node
[12:12] SubStack: deep code is hard to follow and hard to test
[12:12] Glenjamin: ^^ this
[12:12] Nuck: I can switch just by changing a single setting to whatever tabwidth I want
[12:12] Nuck: I disagree, nesting is often not a big deal
[12:13] Nuck: At least, for simple serial cases
[12:13] Glenjamin: there doesn't need to be a hard rule for it
[12:13] Nuck: More than serial, I agree
[12:13] Glenjamin: but when you see ~5 levels of indent, it's worth looking to see if it could be refactored
[12:13] Raynos: https://github.com/Raynos/vows-is/blob/master/src/vows-is.js#L72
[12:13] Nuck: Haha I have refactored
[12:13] Raynos: 1 indent for a method definition in an object, two indents for two async calls, and one ident for an if statement
[12:13] Nuck: Glenjamin: My Jitters code is complete shr
[12:14] Raynos: Is that too much?
[12:14] Nuck: Shit
[12:14] Glenjamin: Raynos: in that case, no
[12:14] Glenjamin: but that's about the limit imo
[12:14] Raynos: I agree
[12:14] Raynos: it is about the limit
[12:14] Raynos: 5 indents needs looking into
[12:15] Glenjamin: i'd possibly define _getServer in the function body and then pass it into getServer
[12:15] Glenjamin: saves one level
[12:15] Raynos: https://github.com/christkv/node-mongodb-native/blob/master/examples/blog.js
[12:15] Raynos: Otherwise you get that ^
[12:15] Nuck: Haha yeah
[12:15] Raynos: Glenjamin: probably worthwhile
[12:15] Raynos: tbh that codebase is ugly and needs a bloody good tidy up
[12:15] Nuck: I generally abstract for cases like that

[12:28] rmzg: Glenjamin: What's with the \[ ]?
[12:28] Nuck: But still, now you have two problems
[12:28] Glenjamin: Raynos: find . | grep <pattern> | xargs <command> does most cases
[12:28] Raynos: o/
[12:29] Glenjamin: rmzg: spaces only
[12:29] Nuck: Heh well gnight I need some sleep
[12:29] Raynos: Yeah but I need to learn <command> or <pattern>
[12:29] Nuck: \s
[12:29] Raynos: I also need to just know more about unix
[12:29] Nuck: Man
[12:29] Raynos: I also need to be in a state where I can open a shell and not fail
[12:29] Nuck: Raynos: I don't do Linux at all, man
[12:29] Nuck: I just know regex
[12:29] rmzg: Glenjamin: You'd want [ ]; but just /^ {20,}\S/... would work
[12:29] Nuck: Haha
[12:30] Raynos: And learn lynx
[12:30] Glenjamin: mm, good point
[12:30] Glenjamin: cardinality after a space just looks weird :D
[12:30] rmzg: The simplest solution is probably converting \t to $X spaces before you check anyway
[12:30] Nuck: Lol I actually used lynx to download something to my vps while on ssh
[12:30] Raynos: Can we convince google to make a command line chrome?

[12:33] dexter_e: Are there performance issues or any drawbacks to defining our methods on the prototype and using instances of the class? 
[12:33] rmzg: Anyway, if you want hipster-nerd cred for your browsing habits, use conkeror
[12:33] dexter_e: Using traditional prototype functions and a single exports.constructor  
[12:34] Nuck: dexter_e: Prototypes are faster than functions creating objects
[12:34] Raynos: dexter_e: ehm no?
[12:34] Nuck: By a large mergin on v8
[12:34] Raynos: Well gigantic prototype chains are stupid
[12:34] Raynos: if you have a chain of prototypes > 4 it gets silly
[12:34] Raynos: or reeks of bad design
[12:35] dexter_e: Not gigantic,  just basic extending EventEmitter n such
[12:35] Raynos: The general rule is functions should only exist once, and shouldnt be created at run time
[12:35] Raynos: I also recommend Object.create, prototypical OO & pd
[12:35] dexter_e: pd ?
[12:35] Raynos: But that might be a style preference

[12:40] Raynos: Its very vague
[12:41] Raynos: Can you ask the question without being vague?
[12:41] dexter_e: let me reword
[12:41] dexter_e: pardon
[12:41] micheil has joined the channel
[12:41] dexter_e: What do you recommend for simple property accessors of models which encapsulate async database requests..
[12:42] dexter_e:   userModel.firstName for example 
[12:42] Raynos: Give me a gist example
[12:42] Raynos: They cant be done
[12:42] Raynos: when you get a userModel cache all the properties
[12:42] dexter_e: Ok    so      userModel.get( property , callback )   right ?
[12:42] Raynos: Or use promises for everything
[12:42] Raynos: Well i never do that
[12:42] Raynos: I use Users.get(userId, callback)
[12:42] Raynos: Getting single properties out of a db is silly.
[12:43] dexter_e: right right, that was just and example :)
[12:43] Raynos: https://github.com/Raynos/so642/tree/master/src/model
[12:43] Raynos: Recent example of database models ^
[12:43] swestcott has joined the channel
[12:44] slifty has joined the channel
[12:44] Raynos: Every call on the db model has a callback. And this is just a thin db abstraction that the domain models should use. We didnt end up writing domain models because it the 48 hour timelimit for nodeknockout was tight
[12:45] Raynos: So we just hard coded the database wrappers into our express routing files \o/ because tight coupling saves a few hours in the short term
[12:45] Glenjamin: Raynos: my idea was that you always use instance.get('prop', cb), then you don't need to know whether lookup is sync or async
[12:45] Raynos: s/coded/coupled/
[12:45] Raynos: But why do async properties

[12:46] Glenjamin: post.author.name, post.comments
[12:46] Raynos: Why not assert that you always load objects asynchronously and all properties are loaded
[12:46] Glenjamin: fk relations
[12:46] Glenjamin: complex calculated fields
[12:46] Raynos: I guess so
[12:46] _kud has joined the channel
[12:46] Glenjamin: lazy loading of expensive properties
[12:46] Glenjamin: there are cases
[12:46] Raynos: But I avoid this by not doing fk
[12:46] Raynos: I just load in id's for anything expensive
[12:46] dexter_e: Raynos:  I see you also create the database connection in the constructor , that was gonna be my next question. 
[12:46] Raynos: and force you to load it asynchronously by id
[12:47] Raynos: So you have post.authorId
[12:47] mehtryx has joined the channel
[12:47] Raynos: and Users.get(authorId, cb)
[12:47] Raynos: I honestly havn't done enough work to see whether abstraction it with an async getter for all properties is worthwhile
[12:48] Raynos: Currently I would say its over engineering but it honestly depends on scale of projects
[12:48] Glenjamin: the case i actually use "models" does pretty much what you described
[12:48] dexter_e: Raynos: Thank you for this example.  
[12:48] coffeecup: any ideas which tool i could use to test my express app?
[12:48] Glenjamin: but for a fully generic model layer, async on all props might be reasonable
[12:48] dexter_e: Do you recommend creating the database connection in the constructor in most cases? 
[12:48] Raynos: dexter_e: https://github.com/Raynos/raynos-blog/blob/master/src/middleware/data/post.js
[12:48] Raynos: I have another example thats significantly more ugly
[12:49] Glenjamin: also user.getMany(['prop1', 'prop2'], cb(err, props))
[12:49] Raynos: coffeecup: https://github.com/Raynos/vows-is
[12:49] garrensmith has joined the channel
[12:49] Glenjamin: for purity you should always pass in some sort of abstracted "data" interface in the constructor
[12:49] Glenjamin: makes it nice and easy to stub it out in testing
[12:49] Raynos: dexter_e: constructor is one option
[12:49] mbrevoort has joined the channel
[12:50] Raynos: Personally I make a model an EventEmitter. Have the model emit "loaded" once its async startup is ready
[12:50] Glenjamin: but given time/effort constraints there's plenty of "this works fine" approaches
[12:50] Raynos: and then pre load all my models on server startup, then start listening to the express server when all models have emitted loaded
[12:50] nail_ has joined the channel
[12:50] Raynos: But that's a bit hackish so I would upgrade to a more heavy event driven architecture

[12:53] Glenjamin: what are you using for traits?
[12:53] Raynos: Hmm, I wouldnt use DI
[12:53] Raynos: Glenjamin: I use pd and object.create
[12:53] Glenjamin: when i say "DI", i mean pass constructor functions around instead of hard-coding

[12:56] dexter_e: Raynos:  https://github.com/Raynos/so642/blob/master/src/model/users.js    I'm looking at this one now..  looks totally clean  I will study this one to model my model after your model  :)  
[12:56] sveisvei has joined the channel
[12:56] Glenjamin: lightweight DI, then the test code passes a mock as options.deps.ExampleGroup
[12:56] Raynos: Glenjamin: That's a way to do it
[12:56] Raynos: dexter_e: that wasnt written by me perse, it was written by yojimbo87
[12:56] Raynos: and its very clean
[12:56] mike5w3c_ has joined the channel
[12:56] Raynos: Glenjamin: Personally I mock out require
[12:57] agreco has left the channel
[12:57] Glenjamin: yeah, i had that before
[12:57] Raynos: Since all dependencies go through requires
[12:57] ap: Raynos: it is undefined.. yet typeof(msg) is object and if i util.inspect it, it is a 'Buffer' and prints out the 300 bytes contained within
[12:57] Glenjamin: and decided that DI was an already solved problem
[12:57] agreco has joined the channel
[12:57] Raynos: ap: buffer does not have readUInt8 ?
[12:57] ap: it only started happening after i moved the code inside of a constructor func in my library
[12:57] ap: if i run the same code in a flat .js program it works fine
[12:57] Glenjamin: since mocking require via Module._load feels brittle

[12:57] Raynos: ap: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.11/api/buffers.html
[12:58] Raynos: Glenjamin: It's hackish as hell but it means you dont have to make your code more verbose merely for the sake of testing
[12:58] Raynos: Personally I say make sure your code doesnt know about tests and the test harness
[12:59] Raynos: and hack the test harness as much as you want as long as it works and keeps your code clean and pure
[12:59] Glenjamin: but dependency injection *is* pure
[12:59] Glenjamin: its more pure than loading specific files/functions - it just takes a little bit more effort
[12:59] jmiller_ has joined the channel
[12:59] AaronMT has joined the channel
[13:00] Raynos: Glenjamin: I agree, but I'd use event emitters rather then literal dependency objects
[13:00] Glenjamin: for convenience my top-level class construct has some defaults, so I can omit options.deps and it works fine
[13:00] ap: Raynos: oh jeez.. i have to sudo this because it is binding to a low port and root is running v0.4.11 and i'm running v0.5.4-pre

[13:00] ap: :(
[13:00] jmiller_ has left the channel
[13:00] ap: didn't realize the api changed!
[13:00] Glenjamin: yeah, I haven't really tried used emitters for general control flow - just callbacks
[13:00] Raynos: Stop using 0.5 :p
[13:00] Raynos: Glenjamin: https://github.com/Raynos/ExpressArchTest
[13:01] ap: Raynos: well i want those read*() funcs :)
[13:01] Raynos: A demo of using a global event emitter for all your communication
[13:01] Raynos: ap: Use buffertools
[13:01] ap: is there any reason to not target .5?
[13:01] Raynos: its unstable
[13:01] Glenjamin: i think i've looked at this before, seems rather tidy
[13:01] Raynos: Major modules (express) do not support 0.5
[13:01] Glenjamin: but my flow is slightly more linear - i'm not writing web servers
[13:02] agreco has left the channel
[13:02] Raynos: True, it's an architecture that's optional
[13:02] ap: that's fine for me though.. this is a dhcp server, not a web module :)
[13:02] slyG has joined the channel
[13:02] Raynos: I'd still recommend against running 0.5
[13:02] Raynos: because its unstable

[13:03] Raynos: Its just more hassle then its worth
[13:03] skratool: in node-amqp, how do you force queue arguments? like some vendor specific stuff of RabbitMQ
[13:03] ap: i wish the docs expressed that these apis were new
[13:03] ap: i already wrote it and got it working.. would be a pain to change now :/
[13:03] Raynos: ap: A docs diff would be great
[13:03] Raynos: You can just use toString(encoding) and split
[13:03] Raynos: Does anyone have a diff setup on all the nodejs docs?
[13:04] ap: the main pita is that if you google for a node api, you get some random version number.. whatever google's indexing returns
[13:04] ap: the practice of keeping each version's docs online doesn't work well with search engines
[13:04] Glenjamin: thats search engine's fault
[13:05] ap: how so?
[13:05] jacter has joined the channel
[13:05] ap: if more people linked to v0.3 docs a year ago than linked to 0.4.1 docs it makes sense
[13:05] Glenjamin: dunno, but having all versions available and the version number in the URL is fine
[13:05] digitalsabre has joined the channel
[13:05] ap: makes sense to a human brain, but not to a search engine
[13:05] Glenjamin: just be sure to sanity check the URL when reading docs
[13:05] Glenjamin: or go directly to api docs yourself
[13:05] arthurdebert has joined the channel
[13:05] ap: a search engine isn't going to know that 0.4.1 is 'prod' and 0.5.5 is 'experimental'
[13:05] Glenjamin: search engines are supposed to find what users want
[13:05] Raynos: ap: meh your competent right?
[13:05] Glenjamin: not the other way around
[13:06] ap: just sayin..
[13:06] Raynos: you can read the node website and go "0.4.11 is current, 0.5.4 is unstable"

[13:09] Glenjamin: yup
[13:09] Raynos: ap: no it doesnt
[13:09] skratool: know about x-expires queue argument, that can make RabbitMQ delete the queue along with messages after some period?
[13:09] Raynos: can you write an app that makes diffs of the docs

[13:14] rfay has joined the channel
[13:14] rendar: Nexxy: but a server written in C/C++ with kqueue/epoll threadpools etc, won't be faster?

[13:15] Nexxy: (SPOILER: the answer is "no")
[13:15] astropirate has joined the channel
[13:15] rendar: Nexxy: i can't understand why, technically speaking erlang is on a VM, a C/C++ server won't
[13:16] astropirate: Are there any multi-db DBALs for Node yet?
[13:16] boaz- has joined the channel
[13:16] baudehlo: Someone did try to write one.
[13:16] Nexxy: rendar, if speed is your only concern I recommend writing ASM
[13:16] Dmitrijus: actually, me had some bad luck with rabbitmq 
[13:16] Nexxy: rendar, direct control over every bit is the only way to ensure maximum efficiency
[13:16] baudehlo: astropirate: I think it was called node-dbi or something.
[13:16] astropirate: baudehlo: how did that turn out?
[13:17] rendar: Nexxy: well, its not that, but i can't figure out how erlang can beat C stuff
[13:17] baudehlo: astropirate: IIRC nobody responded to the mail on the list about it. So I guess little interest.
[13:17] jacter1 has joined the channel
[13:17] boaz has joined the channel
[13:17] Dmitrijus: rendar: it cant, why would you say that? :)
[13:17] Nexxy: rendar, what do you mean by "beat"?
[13:18] Nexxy: erlang was designed for concurrency and fault-tolerance/high availability
[13:18] Nexxy: or I guess OTP was
[13:18] Nexxy: I'm not all that familiar with it
[13:18] astropirate: baudehlo: hmm I am really intrested in a couchDB + mongoDB one   i guess i'm asking too much
[13:19] rendar: Nexxy: i see
[13:19] rendar: Dmitrijus: i don't know, some erlang people says that
[13:20] Dmitrijus: rendar: well, i'm a erlang developer :)
[13:20] rendar: oh
[13:20] Nexxy: rendar, fanboys will always tout their tool of choice's dominance
[13:20] rendar: yes, i agree
[13:21] Nexxy: <insert right-tool-for-the-job speech>
[13:21] Dmitrijus: rendar: actually, if you intergrate some good internal messaging into node.js, it would beat erlang like, really hard
[13:21] Dmitrijus: integrated
[13:21] rendar: i see
[13:21] Glenjamin: s/right/good enough/
[13:23] rendar: thats because node.js has good concurrency routines which manages threadpool in a smarter way?
[13:23] Glenjamin: nodejs has no concurrency
[13:23] Dmitrijus: rendar: actually, the best thing about node.js it that is has no concurency
[13:23] Glenjamin: in the traditional sense
[13:23] Dmitrijus: yes
[13:24] rendar: oh i see
[13:24] rendar: so having just 1 thread managing async stuff, revealed the better solution for say, a server
[13:24] Dmitrijus: rendar: look at all the high performance c servers, the thread-ed models are always slower, while the aio stuff are always faster
[13:25] Dmitrijus: rendar: YES
[13:25] rendar: yes, agreed
[13:25] Nexxy: OS threads!
[13:25] Nexxy: quick way to get DoS'd
[13:25] Dmitrijus: Nexxy: fuck os threads!
[13:25] Nexxy: Dmitrijus, agreed
[13:25] steveCAustin has joined the channel
[13:25] rendar: but i tought that aio stuff + a pool of threads (say, 1 thread per CPU core, e.g. 4 or 8) would be better than just 1 thread, but its not ...
[13:26] Nexxy: it should be
[13:26] agnat has joined the channel
[13:26] Nexxy: in the right circumstance
[13:26] Dmitrijus: rendar: sometimes it is, but you have to be really really careful to synchronise stuff
[13:26] sneakyness_wk has joined the channel
[13:26] sneakyness_wk has joined the channel
[13:26] rendar: Dmitrijus: yes, and syncronization brings overhead
[13:27] Nexxy: if you're synchronizing non-blocking processes it shouldn't be a huge overhead
[13:27] Dmitrijus: rendar: well, not really, but well, i've seen a lot of threaded code which, well, mutexes the global resource and other just wait for it to unlock

[13:29] FireFly|n900 has joined the channel

[13:31] sonnym has joined the channel
[13:31] steveCAustin: Have a beginner usage question:  The examples show "var pool = $.NSAutoreleasePool('alloc')('init');" some have pool('drain') some do not have this.  1)If I alloc all my objects is the 'pool' even nec?  Two, if I don
[13:31] steveCAustin: don't 'drain' what happens??  How long do objects lice?
[13:31] Dmitrijus: rendar: but, the erlang itself has the VM which supports really large amounts of erlang interpretator's, so everything is done in parallel :)
[13:31] rendar: Dmitrijus: uhm, i see, if you want we'll can discuss it later in PM? or we are going off topic here :-P
[13:32] Dmitrijus: rendar: sure
[13:32] Dmitrijus: but anyway, that is, imo, not the best design for the high performance software :)
[13:33] rendar: Dmitrijus: thanks mate, you're great, oh i see, its just a big VM which supports parallels tiny VM into it..basically..
[13:33] thalll has joined the channel
[13:33] rendar: agreed
[13:33] Glenjamin: astropirate: that is rather odd, i think the benchmarks are part of connect, so you could go look at the code
[13:34] Dmitrijus: rendar: also, nice thing about it is that all the communication between servers/modules is done using messaging, so it create a new level of flexibility for the availability and error recovery

[14:27] DrMcKay: ah, so it isn't only me to use Math.sqrt for this kind of benchmarks
[14:27] explodes: Well, if you have var obj = {foo: {bar: {baz: 3}}}; var prop = obj.foo.bar.baz; prop will always be 3, but if an async operation does obj.foo.bar.baz = 4, prop will still be 3...
[14:28] vicapow: explodes: i see
[14:28] Sembiance: vicapow: looks like a cached object is far better in firefox, but in chrome both are about equal. I got equal numbers in chrome, but when I ran it in FF, the cached object was doing 7500 ops/sec vs 1400/sec with the deep object
[14:28] explodes: vicapow: So if you want the absolutely most up to date value, you can do: var prop = foo.bar; and use bar.baz (because it is passed by reference not by value)
[14:28] DrMcKay: vicapow: I have 15,788 ops/sec for caching and 16,143 ops/s without it
[14:28] Glenjamin: eugh
[14:29] Glenjamin: premature microoptimisation
[14:29] Glenjamin: let v8 compile it when its identified as hot

[15:01] baudehlo: it's not.
[15:02] Sembiance: bradleymeck: I don't know enough about erlang to really know what I'm talking about with it. I know it was used to implement couchdb, that's about it.

[15:35] mrryanjohnston_: gruff. is anyone here using hook.io for something cool?

[16:08] Benjie: It's not clear to me if a Writeable Stream can have .write(string) called multiple times without waiting for a 'drain' event - do I need to do my own buffer handling or does Writeable Stream do it for me? http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.8/api/streams.html#writable_Stream
[16:08] softdrink: ACTION pulls his hair out
[16:09] AvianFlu: Benjie, if you're not writing a lot at a time, there's a good chance you'll never notice it
[16:09] brianc: Benjie: the stream will buffer it for you
[16:09] AvianFlu: but when you call write, it returns true or false
[16:10] AvianFlu: so then you just wait for drain and re-write if it returns false
[16:10] AvianFlu: false means "could not write, buffer full" in other words
[16:10] AvianFlu: if your source is a readable stream, though, just do readStream.pipe(writeStream)
[16:10] AvianFlu: that will handle everything for you
[16:11] Benjie: AvianFlu: I understood that was the kernel buffer - what you're saying implies that Writeable Stream has no internal buffer in addition to the kernel buffer.
[16:11] AvianFlu: and I think that's true.
[16:11] towski has joined the channel
[16:12] AvianFlu: might be wrong, but I think that's how that works.
[16:12] Benjie: AvianFlu: thanks for your help. It's not a readable stream (well, it is a large number of readable streamsâ€¦) and it could potentially be too fast for the kernel buffer, so I'll implement my own buffer :)
[16:12] AvianFlu: Stream.pipe() has all that backpressure handling built in

[16:15] temongantengbgt: web soket or long poll?? 
[16:15] Raynos: AvianFlu: True but the official tutorial on the heroku site was painless for me
[16:15] Raynos: they block websockets, longpolling works
[16:16] creationix: websockets are hard to get nowadays since ip addresses are hard to come by
[16:16] Raynos: Heroku wasnt build to do websockets (their scaling system doesnt allow it)
[16:16] AvianFlu: nodejitsu proxies websockets though :)

[16:17] Raynos: But heroku is the most stable free provider without a beta/signup process
[16:17] creationix: sure, but heroku doesn't really support node
[16:18] Raynos: AvianFlu: Will the nodejitsu team offer limited free services after launch?
[16:18] creationix: even dreamhost has some node support
[16:18] Raynos: creatonix: They have no proper support, it's still easy to slap a quick test server on it
[16:18] Raynos: I wouldnt use it for production

[16:24] CoverSlide: or rather 'community' repos
[16:24] creationix: CoverSlide: but how well does it stay up to date
[16:25] creationix: and I'll bet it doesn't support multiple installed versions
[16:25] CoverSlide: it keeps up with stable pretty well
[16:25] creationix: I wrote nvm for my deployment so I can roll back and test easily

[16:28] dscape: anyone knows how to force resp.write write a string so that the data event catches a string and not a object or buffer?
[16:28] dscape: tried all the encodings and none does that

[16:30] agoole: I have nodejs running and I'm using screen to edit and run several files using sockets
[16:30] CoverSlide: resp.write? there's a data event for that?
[16:30] agoole: and once in a while, it says that node or coffee aren't commands anymore
[16:30] creationix: dscape: what "data event"
[16:30] agoole: does anyone have any clue what could be causing my issue ?
[16:31] creationix: dscape: the sending encoding and the receiving encoding aren't tied
[16:31] creationix: it's all buffers while in transit
[16:31] creationix: on readers, you .setEncoding before listening for 'data' events
[16:31] dscape: if you are using node.js only that is true creationix 
[16:31] dscape: or so it seems
[16:31] dscape: problem is im trying to replicate a problem between the couch app server and node
[16:31] dscape: and put that in a unit test
[16:31] dscape: :)
[16:32] blup has joined the channel
[16:32] creationix: dscape: so if resp.write part of a node http server?
[16:32] creationix: *is
[16:32] dscape: yeah
[16:32] creationix: then .setEncoding does nothing to resp
[16:32] creationix: it's only writeable
[16:33] CoverSlide: once it hits the network, it's all binary
[16:33] creationix: dscape: what's on the other side of the socket?
[16:33] creationix: a node http client or something else?
[16:33] dscape: node js http client
[16:33] dscape: request
[16:33] stisti has joined the channel
[16:33] creationix: ok, then .setEncoding on that request to 'utf8' and you'll get strings instead of buffers for data events

[17:14] isaacs: techplexengineer: should be

[18:48] supjeff: twitter put out their boilerplate that uses less
[18:48] Raynos: DrMcKay: charity ?
[18:48] tjholowaychuk: stylus is just a lot larger so it would be somewhat difficult
[18:48] DrMcKay: Raynos: yes :) https://github.com/Relief-1/Relief1
[18:48] supjeff: I wouldn't have even considered less before they did that
[18:49] supjeff: oh
[18:49] supjeff: hmm
[18:49] Raynos: tjholowaychuk: there's value in a client side compiler for on the fly demos / testing as part of the documentation (for stylus)
[18:49] Raynos: Oh you already said that >_<
[18:49] Sorella: tjholowaychuk, there are seriously people that compile CSS in the *browser* in *production*?
[18:49] Sorella: shameful.
[18:49] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[18:49] tjholowaychuk: lots of people actually haha
[18:50] tjholowaychuk: it's pretty brutal
[18:50] supjeff: what are the particular painpoints for porting stylus to the front-end?
[18:50] Raynos: Sorella: it's great, you can add small chunks of LESS to el.style
[18:50] tjholowaychuk: supjeff not sure, i haven't even tried yet, maybe it wouldn't be too bad
[18:50] Raynos: then have a listening hook that polls .style on every element every 5ms
[18:50] Raynos: And get it to parse into CSS then add it back to el.style as CSS
[18:50] Raynos: It works great o/
[18:51] Raynos: </badjoke>
[18:51] hdon- has joined the channel
[18:51] supjeff: lol
[18:51] Sorella: Raynos, I don't think it's good for any production site. As documentation and experimenting platform it can be, but then nothing stopping you from setting Stylus on the backend and polling it on your browser.
[18:51] Raynos: DrMcKay: dnode & socket.io -.-
[18:52] DrMcKay: Raynos: why not?
[18:52] Sorella: I actually did that when I introduced stylus and jade to my co-workers :3
[18:52] Raynos: Same purpose. Why?
[18:52] Raynos: Unless dnode also works on TCP (and not just ws)
[18:52] tjholowaychuk: Sorella yeah it's not difficult at all but i see why people would lean towards less since it's a bit more available
[18:52] kkaefer has left the channel
[18:52] DrMcKay: Raynos: well, we're not using socket.io directly, but dnode requires it
[18:52] yhahn has left the channel
[18:52] Raynos: DrMcKay dnode is build on socket.io these days?
[18:52] DrMcKay: Raynos: but you're right, it shouldn't be there, I think
[18:53] AvianFlu: dnode uses tcp
[18:53] Raynos: tjholowaychuk: is stylus a strict superset?
[18:53] AvianFlu: to talk to browsers, it uses socket.io
[18:53] Raynos: AvianFlu is that tcp or ws ?
[18:53] tjholowaychuk: Raynos no
[18:53] `3rdEden: nope
[18:53] Raynos: That's why I like LESS
[18:53] `3rdEden: dnode has always been using socket.io
[18:53] Raynos: LESS is a strict superset
[18:53] tjholowaychuk: Raynos it is both
[18:53] tjholowaychuk: you can use regular css style as well
[18:53] yogurt_truck has joined the channel
[18:54] Raynos: then what do you mean "no" ?
[18:54] tjholowaychuk: feature-wise less is inferior to stylus and sass
[18:54] tjholowaychuk: because it's both
[18:54] tjholowaychuk: there's the indented style and the css style
[18:54] Raynos: a strict superset means any css is valid
[18:54] Sorella: Raynos, you can write valid CSS in Stylus.
[18:54] Sorella: well, not really if your CSS uses tabs.
[18:54] aron_ has joined the channel
[18:55] Sorella: and such. But then, it's you having bad coding styles.
[18:55] Raynos: tabs?
[18:55] Raynos: tabs are bad?
[18:55] tjholowaychuk: if anything stylus can be more css-like since you can use transparent mixins
[18:55] tjholowaychuk: you can use tabs
[18:55] tjholowaychuk: just not spaces and tabs
[18:55] Sorella: Raynos, they are. Specially if you use them for alignment.
[18:55] Raynos: My main question was can i rename a css file to a styl file and it will just work
[18:55] Raynos: Oh if you mix spaces and tabs then your an idiot
[18:56] tjholowaychuk: unless it was written in a very odd style yes
[18:56] creationix: semicolons!
[18:56] Raynos: Didnt know that. Might look at styl
[18:56] creationix: 2-space indents!
[18:56] tjholowaychuk: boilerplate for example works fine and it looks absolutely retarded

[20:39] jorenl_ has joined the channel
[20:39] Raynos: Are constructor functions currently capitalized to emphasize they are a "constructor" or that they are to be used with `new` ?
[20:40] kiffness has joined the channel
[20:40] tbranyen: Raynos: lol we were just talking about that at Bocoup today
[20:40] tbranyen: Depends
[20:41] tjholowaychuk: new Depends
[20:41] Raynos: I personally do it because I dont use `new` anywhere in my code
[20:41] tbranyen: Like the Math object is captialized
[20:41] tbranyen: but its not invoked with new
[20:41] Raynos: So it's simply identifying that these objects are meant as prototype "blueprints" and should not be used or invoked directly
[20:41] qbert: I capitalize them
[20:42] tjholowaychuk: blueprints?

[20:45] CoverSlide: ALL_CAPS for constants
[20:45] trotter has joined the channel
[20:45] CoverSlide: other variables, either underline_seperated or lowerCamelCased
[20:45] CoverSlide: depends on the user
[20:46] Nuck: lowerCamelCase is JS
[20:46] softdrink: var classInstance = new ClassConstructor();
[20:46] JSManiacs: jorenl_: I usually make an express server (which uses connect) 
[20:46] JSManiacs: var app = express.createServer();
[20:46] JSManiacs: then pass the instance of the server app to socket.io
[20:46] JSManiacs: var io = require('socket.io').listen(app);
[20:47] perezd_ has joined the channel
[20:47] Nuck: You can do that with a regular Node http too
[20:47] mjr_ has joined the channel
[20:47] jorenl_: JSManiacs: oh.and can I do it without express, just http.listen()? (Nuck?)
[20:47] Nuck: socket.io's site has an example
[20:47] Nuck: jorenl_: Aye, you pass the http thing to the listen
[20:47] ayo: http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.5.5/node.exe <- downloading... at 6kbs... wtf
[20:48] CoverSlide: as long as it emits 'upgrade' you can use it
[20:48] jorenl_: Nuck: cool. I'm trying to keep this thing very low resource usage. (although it might not matter at all)

[20:48] ayo: aaand... the download died D:
[20:48] ayo: 3rd try :f
[20:48] Raynos: tjholowaychuk: I see objects used in prototype chain as a "blueprint"
[20:49] tjholowaychuk: Raynos that's what a prototype is
[20:49] Raynos: I also hate saying "classes" when I talk about javascript. I die a little inside
[20:49] tiagobutzke has joined the channel
[20:49] Raynos: So the best alternative word I could think of is "blueprint"
[20:49] Nuck: jorenl_: haha you probably shouldn't be using socket.io then
[20:49] ayo: "constructor thingies which are called with new"
[20:49] Nuck: Anyways, there's this thing, called premature optimization
[20:49] mykul_ has joined the channel
[20:50] tjholowaychuk: what ayo said
[20:50] jorenl_: Nuck: no way around socket.io for creating a live app right
[20:50] tjholowaychuk: constructors are constructors, prototypes are prototypes
[20:50] joshkehn has left the channel
[20:50] jorenl_: & how is it resource intensive?
[20:50] Nuck: jorenl_: You can roll your own setup.
[20:50] _kud has joined the channel
[20:50] Nuck: And how is Express resource intensive?
[20:50] jorenl_: I don't know
[20:50] Nuck: I'd wager it's probably better than anything you use
[20:50] Nuck: tjholowaychuk put some mad work into it
[20:51] Raynos: Yes prototypes are prototypes, but I need to give a name to objects I only use as arguments to Object.create.
[20:51] creationix: you want bare-bones with little features, use raw connect or even raw stack
[20:51] tjholowaychuk: Raynos that's still a prototype
[20:51] creationix: but with stack you have to write your own middleware
[20:51] JaKWaC has joined the channel
[20:51] creationix: but express isn't really any more resource intensive than connect afaik
[20:51] saikat has joined the channel
[20:51] tjholowaychuk: nope
[20:51] Nuck: And Connect isn't all that heavy, either
[20:51] Raynos: Its a prototype when inserted into someones prototype chain. On it's own it's just an object.
[20:52] tjholowaychuk: not at all
[20:52] jorenl_: express then
[20:52] tjholowaychuk: Raynos it's still conceptually a prototype
[20:52] tjholowaychuk: js is just weird and has .prototype / constructors
[20:52] creationix: right, in a microbenchmark connect may add more overhead than something like stack, but on real works usage it's completely the same
[20:52] Raynos: only if you know its used in a prototype chain
[20:52] creationix: what matters is what api you want
[20:52] creationix: they are all really fast
[20:52] tjholowaychuk: haha yeah features vs less features
[20:52] creationix: now badly written middlewares can cause slowness quite easily
[20:53] fiq_ has joined the channel
[20:53] creationix: tjholowaychuk: you cleaned up the connect middlewares since I've worked on them I assume
[20:53] Nuck: In fact, Express has been shown on some benchmarks to be faster than a similar raw Node.js server
[20:53] jorenl_: I'm still using apache+php for static serving (because I need to use the facebook api and afaik there's no FB SDK for node?)
[20:53] creationix: Nuck: that's cause it caches
[20:53] `3rdEden: Nuck jorenl_ or you could just contribute to the project instead of rolling your own comet server ;)
[20:53] creationix: it's more code, but being smarter
[20:53] Raynos: What is stack?
[20:53] Nuck: creationix: And does it itself :D
[20:54] fiq_ has joined the channel
[20:54] kiffness has joined the channel
[20:54] tjholowaychuk: yeah more code doesnt mean it's slow
[20:54] tjholowaychuk: at all
[20:54] tjholowaychuk: look at v8
[20:54] creationix: stack is my new version of connect I use on phones https://github.com/creationix/stack
[20:54] creationix: it's super bare bones
[20:54] jorenl_: `3rdEden: I think I don't really understand what you're truing to say there. It's running on my own box fyi
[20:54] Nuck: creationix: Nice rhyme
[20:54] Raynos: creatonix: It's tiny
[20:54] creationix: right
[20:55] creationix: super barebones
[20:55] `3rdEden: jorenl_ i was refering to the socket.io conversation you had with Nuck
[20:55] creationix: barely more than what node provides

[20:55] creationix: tjholowaychuk: you should have been at nodeconf summer camp

[20:57] Nuck: CROWDSOURCED
[20:57] creationix: CoverSlide: webos

[20:57] creationix: but some phones too
[20:57] Nuck: ACTION prays WebOS makes it onto other devices
[20:57] creationix: I think it will, it's looking good

[20:58] CoverSlide: problem is it's a fire sale
[20:58] creationix: but it sure helped get rid of excess inventory
[20:58] radiodario has joined the channel
[20:59] Nuck: creationix: And then they did another run
[20:59] Dave_Stein has joined the channel
[20:59] Nuck: That was what made me laugh
[20:59] Nuck: "Oh hey, we're losing $200 with each tablet, let's make MORE"
[20:59] creationix: not really another run, just assembling parts that were already bought
[20:59] Nuck: ah
[20:59] Dave_Stein: my coworker says he tried Node at home a couple of months ago and when an exception happened, it crashed the sever. Was he being crazy or was there some validity?
[20:59] CoverSlide: crashed the whole server?
[20:59] Nuck: Dave_Stein: Unless you handle the exception, yes
[20:59] CoverSlide: or just the running app?
[21:00] Dave_Stein: CoverSlide: the server, looks like Nuck says yes 
[21:00] Nuck: Eh
[21:00] Nuck: Not a whole server
[21:00] Nuck: Should just have the app die
[21:00] CoverSlide: probably a problem with his os
[21:00] Nuck: I'm actually tempted to buy a TouchPad for $99
[21:00] Dave_Stein: he says his http server died
[21:00] CoverSlide: i wish i had some extra money for a $99 touchpad
[21:00] ctide: i'd def buy a touchpad for $100
[21:01] ctide: barnes and noble fucked me on getting one :(
[21:01] jorenl__ has joined the channel
[21:01] Dave_Stein: but you think that was cause his config is screwy?
[21:01] Nuck: Dave_Stein: In Node, tehre is no HTTP server on top of it
[21:01] Nuck: In front, yes
[21:01] Nuck: But it'll act like a reverse proxy
[21:01] CoverSlide: 99% of the time, an exception is user error
[21:01] Nuck: And that's all up to you
[21:01] jorenl__: Error installing express: npm ERR! Required: {"node":">= 0.4.1 < 0.5.0"} Actual:   {"npm":"1.0.22","node":"v0.5.3-pre"}
[21:01] jorenl__: Do I have to downgrade node? :/
[21:01] CoverSlide: ok maybe that statistic is a bit biased
[21:01] creationix: I'd buy 5 touchpads for 99 if only I could find them in stock somewhere
[21:02] AvianFlu: jorenl__, 0.5.x is unstable and it will break things
[21:02] creationix: they are *awesome* hacker devices
[21:02] JSManiacs: Dave_Stein: Keep in mind, node and the default http module is fairly low level on purpose.  If you want a more robust "server", then run an application stack on top of it
[21:02] AvianFlu: unless you're trying to do testing and commit to node core, use 0.4.11
[21:02] Nuck: creationix: Well, as a student, a cheap tablet sounds nice
[21:02] neilk_ has joined the channel
[21:02] Nuck: Not to mention it had Node up on there
[21:02] Raynos: jorenl__ stop using unstable
[21:02] tbranyen: creationix: really wish i could have gotten a touchpad :(
[21:02] jorenl__: AvianFlu: damned. Restart installation.
[21:02] Nuck: I might look for one in this next run
[21:03] Nuck: Or is that already done?
[21:03] zemanel has joined the channel
[21:03] jorenl__: It's been running for a long time without crashing so that's positive I guess
[21:03] creationix: Nuck: I haven't heard anything, so I don't think it hit the shores yet
[21:03] ctide: it's not done
[21:03] Raynos: Dave_stein: the http server is the application. So any error crashes your application/server. In production you would use something that does proper error handling. There simply is no error handling by default
[21:03] Dave_Stein: JSManics: thanks for answer
[21:03] Nuck: Good, I hope they let the fervor die out
[21:04] Dave_Stein: I'm going to make coworker read all of this :)

[21:06] creationix: now there are $99 android tablets out there where the vendor actually makes money
[21:06] creationix: but I wouldn't buy them
[21:06] Nuck: creationix: The problem with HP is that they cut corners
[21:06] Nuck: It has the same specs, but lower quality
[21:06] Nuck: worse workmanship
[21:06] Nuck: So it gives out sooner
[21:06] JSManiacs: Nuck: For 99 I'd but 3, mount them on my walls and use them as fancy light switches

[22:29] snowinferno|21: Hi all, I have a function that I'm using as a constructor, it works fine the first time around but when I try to overwrite my object with a fresh version of the object, i get an error that undefined is not a function at CALL_NON_FUNCTION_AS_CONSTRUCTOR. If it matters, my constructor is in a separate module that I have importied via var myMod = require( './myMod.js' ); so the line looks something like socket['MyData'] = new myMod.MYDATA();

[22:52] bionic_apple: bnoordhuis: would that give me the ability to pull the full contents of the tty pseudo-terminal though?
[22:52] joshkehn: Looks like Â£ doesn't work in the repl.
[22:52] bionic_apple: it just seems like tty was made for that
