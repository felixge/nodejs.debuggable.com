[00:17] bartek: Hi. How do I make node.js aware of npm packages? I installed socket.io via npm, but it just doesn't find it on require.

[00:18] isaacs: bartek: what version of node and npm?
[00:18] isaacs: npm -v ; node -v
[00:18] bartek: npm is 0.3.15, node is 0.4.2
[00:18] isaacs: npm get root
[00:18] isaacs: wha'ts that output^?
[00:19] bartek: First line: /usr/local/lib/node .. then it ends with ok
[00:19] isaacs: export NODE_PATH=/usr/local/lib/node >> ~/.bashrc ; . ~/.bashrc

[00:20] bartek: cool, thanks.
[00:20] bartek: didndt see that documented, is it common?
[00:20] bartek: Hmm, still complains about missing module
[00:21] bartek: Nevermind, its another error
[00:22] spaceinvader: it depends how you set up npm, for me it was fine out of the box
[00:22] spaceinvader: with node installed to a prefix ~/node
[00:22] gazumps has joined the channel
[00:22] isaacs: bartek: the issue is that you've installed node using homebrew, most likely
[00:22] bartek: I think I did, yes
[00:22] bartek: What's wrong with that?
[00:22] isaacs: bartek: and that does not set up node in a way to see /usr/local/lib/node in the default require.paths
[00:23] isaacs: which npm 0.x relies on
[00:23] bartek: Ah
[00:23] isaacs: it's a bit different with npm 1.0.  then you just install things locally to your project if you want to require() them, sorta like `npm bundle` in 0.x
[00:23] isaacs: so everything's separated into its own little project.  it's lovely.
[00:23] bartek: Interesting, like virtualenvs in Python (if you've used it)
[00:23] isaacs: somewhat similar, yes.
[00:24] isaacs: i like to steal everything everyone likes. :)
[00:24] bartek: hah, nice :)
[00:24] bartek: Very cool
[00:24] halfhalo: good man
[00:24] isaacs: you can still install globally, but then it goes into $prefix/lib/node_modules
[00:24] isaacs: that's important for bins to end up in your PATH
[00:24] isaacs: but really should not be used for require()-able stuff
[00:25] skiz: isaacs: what about something alongs the lines of a Gemfile in ruby? hehe 
[00:25] isaacs: skiz: yeah, it's "package.json"
[00:25] skiz: I need to check that out :)
[00:25] isaacs: skiz: write onna those, then do "npm install" and it'll install all the things in teh "dependencies" hash
[00:25] isaacs: skiz: npm help json ; npm help developers
[00:26] skiz: nice, figured that was just for packaged apps
[00:26] blueadept has joined the channel

[01:20] jonaslund: jamool: many of the databases comes as SQL data or can be importer there. So since node can talk to DB's you're set if you choose that path
[01:21] jonaslund: or if you import the raw data it's mostly a matter of having a continious index

[02:22] samcday: Aikar, are you using gdb + node_g?
[02:22] Aikar: so that means its literally something in the normal msgpack calls 
[02:22] ryah: Aikar: stdout fd is non-blocking
[02:22] Aikar: no but my shell has decided to start printing a callstack on segfault w/o even running gdb lol...
[02:22] ryah: if you're printing a ton of stuff it could be the buffer is full
[02:22] samcday: o.O

[02:23] Aikar: samcday: 
[02:23] Aikar: not sure how its doing that now
[02:23] Aikar: it use to just print segfault
[02:23] Aikar: oh
[02:23] Aikar: maybe cause valgrind installed the libc debug ?
[02:23] samcday: Yeah my libc does that sometimes too
[02:23] doubletap has joined the channel
[02:23] samcday: Not even sure if it's because of valgrind
[02:24] samcday: But some random memory hiccups will do that

[02:24] Aikar: i commented out the line that actually converts msgpack to v8 is why its returning null
[02:24] samcday: You should use gdb though, then youi can jump frames
[02:24] samcday: Examine locals, see what's going on
[02:24] Aikar: problem is its dieing in msgpack official library :/
[02:24] samcday: Compile it with debug then
[02:24] Aikar: and ive copied their example code almost to the T
[02:24] Aikar: i wouldnt even really know how to fix it tho lol
[02:24] samcday: You don't need to
[02:24] samcday: If you can at least see their debug symbols
[02:25] Aikar: http://wiki.msgpack.org/display/MSGPACK/QuickStart+for+C+Language
[02:25] samcday: You can see where you're entering their lib, and with what data it's getting
[02:25] samcday: I had the same issues with libgit2
[02:25] samcday: Seriously, gdb + node_g is god, if you compile your third party libs with debug too, you get a (mostly) full stack trace every time
[02:26] samcday: There's usually a couple of lines of V8 voodoo that don't have symbols of course, but you get my point
[02:26] Aikar: that gist i just pasted shows the variables im passing to the functions, and those look correct

[02:33] ryah: mraleph: you here?
[02:33] samcday: I dunno though - Ijst used --debug and I was using gdb + node_g fine.
[02:33] samcday: ACTION attributes it to black magic, and that's ok with him
[02:34] Aikar: how come make install is compiling even more stuff
[02:34] ryah: ACTION tries too
[02:34] Aikar: when make said nothing left to do
[02:34] samcday: installing a whole other binary

[02:36] Aikar: how do you do "gdb node blah.js" ?
[02:36] Aikar: says blah.js isnt a core dump
[02:36] samcday: gdb --args node_g balls.js
[02:37] ryah: ACTION tries to fix it..
[02:37] samcday: Or just gdb node_g then key in `run balls.js` at the gdb shell

[02:38] samcday: No clue :P

[02:41] samcday: I have a question actually, hoping someone can help. If I use http.get and pass in a Connection: keep-alive header, it seems that my node app won't exit when I'm done - presumably because the http connection is still open to the server. How do I close it?
[02:42] Aikar: samcday: ok i tried to help data to find myself, but kinda overwhelmed lol.. so how do i view args to a call?
[02:42] ryah: https://gist.github.com/909185

[02:42] samcday: If you're in a frame

[02:45] Aikar: but seems like msgpack irc community is dead, lemme see if they use forums
[02:46] samcday: Aikar: maybe you should just try a small test of msgpack in a standard binary first
[02:46] samcday: Using the same input you're invoking from node script
[02:46] Aikar: it works ok 2 times
[02:46] Aikar: its ALWAYS the 3rd attempt
[02:47] samcday: Weird :p
[02:47] Aikar: the streaming api works in a way you keep feeding it buffers, it gives you data back once it decodes something completely
[02:47] samcday: Respamming a question from earlier, someone help me fix it so I can make my node script clone the node git repository natively :P I have a question actually, hoping someone can help. If I use http.get and pass in a Connection: keep-alive header, it seems that my node app won't exit when I'm done - presumably because the http connection is still open to the server. How do I close it?
[02:47] Aikar: so i feed it, then call the get esults function
[02:47] Yuffster_ has joined the channel
[02:47] Aikar: its on the 3rd feed, the getResult segfaults
[02:48] Aikar: samcday: client.end() ?
[02:48] samcday: is client returned from http.get or something?
[02:49] samcday: I tried that and it didn't seem to work
[02:49] samcday: looked like http.Agent was insisting on keeping the connections open or something
[02:50] Aikar: http.get({}, f(req) { req.end(); }); ?
[02:50] Aikar: oh keep alive hmm
[02:51] copongcopong has joined the channel
[02:51] samcday: Yeah and I have to use keep-alive, since I'm pulling a bunch of loose objects off github, I tried not using keepalive and cloning a repo took 3x longer

[02:53] samcday: :P
[02:53] samcday: Meh I'll look at it again later. I gotta jet. Good luck with your msgpack stuff Aikar :D
[02:55] Aikar: i wish i knew how to fix it
[02:55] Aikar: i guess ima have to try downgrading msgpack
[02:55] ryah: Aikar: pgries has a msgpack lib
[02:55] Aikar: but i checked the changelog and nothing major changed
[02:55] Aikar: ryah: yeah i know but his is the basic imp, im trying to implement the new streaming API
[02:56] Aikar: ive updated his for node .3.x already
[02:56] Aikar: but under heavy data flow it can just get backed up
[02:56] ryah: ah
[02:56] Aikar: so streaming should solve that problem

[03:02] Aikar: official lol
[03:02] Aikar: latest C lib
[03:03] Aikar: init unpacker, init result, on data -> (reserve buffer, copy to buffer, inform msgpack length of data you copied into it, msgpack_unpacker_next(result), read data from result if it returned true) > repeat, destroy unpacker and result
[03:04] Aikar: thats the steps the C demo shows, thats what im doing
[03:04] pyrotechnick: do u have bindings
[03:05] mscdex: i wish javascript had named capture groups for regexp
[03:05] mscdex: :(
[03:05] pyrotechnick: it can
[03:05] pyrotechnick: theres a lib
[03:05] pyrotechnick: xregexp i think its called
[03:05] pyrotechnick: http://xregexp.com/
[03:05] pyrotechnick: i dunno how ull go in node but it works in the browser
[03:05] pyrotechnick: pretty sure ive used it in node before
[03:05] pyrotechnick: without much trouble
[03:05] Aikar: pyrotechnick: https://github.com/aikar/wormhole/blob/master/src/wormhole.cc#L84

[03:06] Aikar: so i do in js> wormhole = new Wormhole() to give each stream its own unpacker, then wormhole->unpack(data) really shoulda named that feed
[03:06] Aikar: then call wormhole->getResult();
[03:06] mscdex: pyrotechnick: yeah i was already looking at that, but it's nicer to have it native
[03:06] Aikar: pyrotechnick: it segfaults in msgpacks code
[03:06] mscdex: :/
[03:06] pyrotechnick: :(
[03:07] pyrotechnick: msddex submit a patch try get it into v8 or node :p
[03:07] Aikar: git clone that, make, then do node examples/wormhole.js and type #'s to stdin
[03:07] mscdex: parsing ftp directory listings is a pita
[03:07] pyrotechnick: it would be nicer if it was native yes
[03:07] pyrotechnick: ok aikar
[03:08] pyrotechnick: do i need msgpack lib or anything?
[03:08] Aikar: no its bundled

[08:11] doubletap has joined the channel
[08:11] _krs_: The client tries to fetch a url that does return a 404 - but nodejs pretends it's 200
[08:12] ryah: really? how to reproduce?
[08:12] ryah: are you sue it actually is sending 404?
[08:12] _krs_: yes, curl reports it
[08:12] _krs_: but wait, I'll paste a full example
[08:13] jesusabdullah: It depends on what you mean by "computer science." A bachellors in CS teaches you programming and algorithms and stuff, but you can learn a lot of the real-world stuff on your own and/or in the field
[08:14] Kiba: I don't know anything about aglorithm
[08:14] jesusabdullah: research-grade CS is tougher, but may not actually be your deal. I mean, have you *read* a CS research paper? Shit's intense.
[08:14] jesusabdullah: Well, can you program Kiba?
[08:14] Kiba: yes
[08:14] pkrumins: ryah: do you have control over npm server(s)? something is down, if you do npm ls or npm install xxxx, it just hangs and then reports that Error: ETIMEDOUT, Connection timed out
[08:14] jesusabdullah: Then you're probably good! Algorithms just means "way to solve some particular problem" so, when you come against that problem, do some googling and asking around and you should hit on the right one
[08:14] jesusabdullah: imo

[08:15] Kiba: well
[08:15] jesusabdullah: There are plenty of people with BS's in CS that are pretty rubbish at programming, and plenty of physics and engineering majors that are pretty good at programming.
[08:15] Kiba: I meant aglorithm and stuff
[08:15] _krs_: wow, bad example, there should be a trailing slash in the url
[08:16] _krs_: curl -i http://www.hudora.de/this_is_a_404/

[08:17] doubletap1 has joined the channel
[08:17] jesusabdullah: Most of it is either particular to your problem, or just general ways to go about things in whatever system you're working with.
[08:18] jesusabdullah: So, like, in LabVIEW, you end up learning about state machines because until recently, it was pretty much the only reasonable way to write a lot of stuff.
[08:18] jesusabdullah: They have events now, so that's a lot better
[08:18] Kiba: I am going to write a RTS game
[08:18] jesusabdullah: Or, if you're implementing grep, then there's a specific algorithm that makes it uber fast
[08:19] jesusabdullah: but then you read a bunch about how to implement grep, y'know?
[08:19] _krs_: jesusabdullah: do you read the freebsd-current list? :)
[08:19] jesusabdullah: Or, if you're trying to write an RTS, then you'll end up reading about good algorithms for implementing AIs, or whatever you need
[08:19] jesusabdullah: _krs_: I don't! I never really got into the BSDs
[08:19] Kiba: I won't be implementing AIs
[08:19] Kiba: my game
[08:20] Kiba: is heavily based on autonomous units
[08:20] _krs_: jesusabdullah: there was a thread about speeding up grep recently
[08:20] jesusabdullah: huh
[08:20] jesusabdullah: Cool!
[08:20] Kiba: speeding up grep is cool?
[08:20] jesusabdullah: I just knew that grep was one of those ones that people talk about because it's been pretty well optimized for speed
[08:20] jesusabdullah: lots of leet haxxx there
[08:20] jesusabdullah: Kiba: If you like algorithms :)
[08:20] Kiba: ACTION doesn't know anything about algorithms
[08:21] Kiba: I did computer science in high school
[08:21] jesusabdullah: Like I said, algorithms aren't a secret sauce. It's just basically a method for doing something
[08:21] Kiba: I learned the sorting algorithsm..but I can never remember them when I go work on my projects
[08:21] jesusabdullah: That's fine though Kiba, because you don't need to implement them yourself.
[08:22] jesusabdullah: You don't learn algorithms so that you can re-implement quicksort. You learn them so that you have a general idea for how to tackle problems.
[08:22] _krs_: can anybody reproduce the status code 200 for responses that are actually 404?
[08:22] Kiba: jesusabdullah: my teacher just teach us a bunch of sorting algorithms and we don't do anything more than that
[08:22] Kiba: no, it was mostly a "beginner programming" class
[08:23] jesusabdullah: Kiba: The take-home message is basically this: Some ways of solving a problem are faster than others. Some of them are only faster some of the time.
[08:23] Kiba: ACTION never needs to optimize his code yet
[08:23] jesusabdullah: Sometimes you implement a more complex algorithm because it takes less steps in the long run.
[08:23] jesusabdullah: Sometimes you implement an algorithm whose worst-case runtime is pretty long, but has a nice average.
[08:24] jesusabdullah: For example: For "linear programming," which is a type of optimization problem, the simplex algorithm is really common because it has a pretty good average runtime, and is well-understood.
[08:25] jesusabdullah: There are other algorithms that do the same thing with a *much* better worst-case runtime, but tend to not do as well as the simplex algorithm in the Real World.
[08:25] jesusabdullah: But of course, in the Real World you're not going to write your own simplex method. You're gonna use a package some other people wrote that implements it, and then pass it your particular problem.
[08:25] mc_greeny has joined the channel
[08:26] Kiba: well...is there case when knowing algorithms would help a lot in simplying my codebase and make it easier to understand?
[08:26] jesusabdullah: Probably not
[08:26] jesusabdullah: unless you find yourself working on a problem that someone has likely already looked at
[08:26] jesusabdullah: in which case you do some research
[08:26] Kiba: I had a really hard time understanding the networking code because my model of the array data I sent is constantly wrong
[08:27] Kiba: well
[08:27] jesusabdullah: There *is* the idea of learning how to make things pretty and understandable, but that's not really algorithms
[08:27] Kiba: my networking code for the tris clone
[08:27] jesusabdullah: That's more coding style

[08:31] Kiba: there's khan academy at least

[08:45] micheil: I'm going to think of using a growing buffer for the incoming streams, rather then storing bytes in arrays and shit.

[09:42] jesusabdullah: but you read the docs and such?
[09:42] jesusabdullah: and cygwin didn't return some kinda error?
[09:42] PT: i searched for this error. I seen some more people having the same problem. but all were unanswered
[09:42] jesusabdullah: like, in the ./configure state?
[09:42] PT: followed the wiki to install it
[09:42] jesusabdullah: Is it in github issues or anything?
[09:42] PT: so i did the ./configure thing
[09:43] PT: i am not sure if it is
[09:43] jesusabdullah: ./configure is a script that finds all your dependencies and such so that make can do its job
[09:43] jesusabdullah: typically
[09:43] jesusabdullah: At the least, if you're missing something important you'll usually see something complain-y
[09:43] PT: hm okay
[09:44] jesusabdullah: Maybe see if that says anything about tcp, or lack thereof
[09:44] jesusabdullah: That'd be what I would do
[09:44] PT: i'll have a look
[09:44] PT: thanks so far :)

[09:45] jesusabdullah: If you can't find someone in here that actually works on the codebase (and it's odd hours for that right now!), that'd be where I would go next
[09:45] PT: configure finished successfully
[09:45] jesusabdullah: Hmm!
[09:45] jesusabdullah: And no glaring "NO"s?
[09:45] PT: 4 no's 6 no founds
[09:45] jesusabdullah: Any of them look related to the tcp stack?

[09:46] jesusabdullah: Okay, well
[09:46] jesusabdullah: My next suggestion would be to hit up github issues, and then to come back here in, oh, 8 hours or something
[09:46] jesusabdullah: You can also ping ryah directly, if he's idling, and maybe he'll see it tomorrow :/

[10:56] Stan____: @kuebk it is because you cloned joyent/node and not your fork

[11:57] pita: is here a key/value store expert? I need a opinion for a open source project
[11:58] Ezku\: better skip the meta and ask straight
[11:59] pita: ok, what are good use cases for key value stores, and what are bad use cases?
[12:00] pita: can you do everything with it or is it only a very special case
[12:00] mike_miller: pita: Why don't you state what you are trying to do with key-value stores?
[12:00] pita: I want to save documents with revisions of them
[12:00] Ezku\: pita: you better do some research and ask something more specific
[12:01] jakeskik: pita: check couchdb
[12:01] jakeskik: for documents, you want document db instead of key/value store (e.g. redis)
[12:02] Micfire: actually you can do pretty much everything with k/v
[12:02] jakeskik: mongodb and couchdb are the most obivious choises. couch provides automatic revisioning, mongodb more familiar and comprehensive query interface
[12:02] Micfire: it just takes a lot of brain power to come up with key schemes that allow you to do all the things you want in case you need more complicated queries
[12:03] Micfire: I think better question is that do you need to scale
[12:03] Micfire: MongoDB & CouchDB are not properly scalable
[12:03] jakeskik: Micfire: you can do everything with oracle too :) It's just about which suits you best
[12:04] Micfire: jakeskik: except scale ;)
[12:04] Ezku\: Micfire: interesting. What do you mean, "properly"?
[12:04] Micfire: Ezku\: well, for example mongodb uses sharding
[12:04] pita: I will write my question in stack overflow
[12:05] Micfire: it works to a certain point but it has lot's of problems
[12:05] pita: I'm more interested in how to save it
[12:05] pita: and not which db :P
[12:05] jakeskik: scalability is one dimension for sure. However, you don't need to scale every project -> engineer time is usually more expensive than cpu time..until proven that you really need to scale
[12:06] Micfire: jakeskik: exactly.. that's why I would recommend Riak
[12:06] Micfire: with Riak Search you basically get all the perks of MongoDB with true scalability
[12:06] Micfire: and one of my favorite features is that you can choose your own backend
[12:07] Micfire: I'm very interested in benchmarking Riak with Redis as backend
[12:07] jakeskik: hmm..I need to take closer look on that one. Thanks for the tip :)

[12:08] Micfire: I actually picked MongoDB for the project I'm paid to work on right now and now that I have been playing with Riak, I feel like I made a mistake

[12:09] Micfire: that guys sums it up pretty well
[12:09] jakeskik: Micfire: we are also working with Mongo. Need to take closer look on Riak too.
[12:10] Micfire: also one thing in MongoDB that sucks and which they obviously don't like to advertise is that Mongo's mapreduce is not distributed
[12:10] muhqu_ has joined the channel
[12:10] Micfire: that is a HUGE pain point when you need to process a lot of info where mapreduce is suppose to be great
[12:10] deedubs has joined the channel
[12:11] Micfire: in mongo you don't actually get the benefit of many clusters like you should when you use mapreduce
[12:12] Micfire: but yeah, these are things you should be aware of.. many of these can be dealt with cash a.k.a getting more horsepower but if you are running a startup with shoestring budget, then you might want to make some adjustments before it's too late...
[12:13] V1: what is the difference between process.memoryUsage vs os.freemem and os.totalmem?
[12:13] christophsturm: Micfire: "M/R is already parallel in MongoDB if you're running a sharded cluster. This is the main point of M/R anyway - to put the computation on the same node as the data." http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2794377/mongodb-whats-the-point-of-using-mapreduce-without-parallelism
[12:13] Micfire: jakeskik: oh and one more thing.. Riak is gone a major overhaul in the past year so a lot of the stuff you find about Riak and it's performance is completely outdated.. for example they have replaced Innostore with Bitcask and so on
[12:14] V1 has left the channel
[12:15] Micfire: christophsturm: "Am I right in assuming, that the current way of taking advantage of a multi-core computer is by running multiple MongoDB instances on the same machine?"
[12:15] Micfire: so is it actually able to distribute the job around in the cluster or does this mean only instances in one machine?
[12:16] Micfire: it's really good and will save me a lot of trouble if 10gen has managed to make it truly distributed
[12:16] k1ttty has joined the channel
[12:16] christophsturm: that link says that it is, and that multicore mr on one server is also coming
[12:18] Micfire: christophsturm: http://wiki.basho.com/Riak-Compared-to-MongoDB.html .. there's some good points about problems with Mongo's design
[12:19] Micfire: I bet 1.8 release of mongo will improve things but still the fundamental design in MongoDB makes it really hard to scale properly and without problems
[12:19] Micfire: just ask FourSquare ;)
[12:19] christophsturm: Micfire: we use hadoop
[12:20] framlin: Micfire: ok, as they define scalable, may be most DBs are not, but I think it's more intrestigng, if you can build scalable-architectures with your system and there is cochdb very "flexible" and therefor kinda scalable ....

I'm going through one of Ryan Dahls video and I got to this example: http://dpaste.com/529990/ -- My question is, why is it when I don't write \n at the end of the res.write("Hello"); will it not work as expected? Instead it waits 2 seconds, then writes "Hello world" all at once. If I add \n it works as expected. Just want to make sure I understand the core of how this works

[12:26] Micfire: christophsturm: well, hadoop is great but it's too much hassle for us ... if we would have started the project like 3-4 years ago, we would have good to hadoop also.. I think these new options just have much easier APIs to work with.

[13:25] V1: You have been saying it for months now ;)
[13:25] mraleph: micheil: well file an issue, if you are sure that it should not accept 0xBF
[13:25] floby: bradleymeck: you're looking for a pure node.js websocket client ?
[13:25] bradleymeck: yep
[13:25] micheil: mraleph: pretty sure of it.
[13:26] mraleph: I know nothing about WebSockets and all other Web thingys
[13:26] bradleymeck: i can port AS if needed i guess
[13:26] micheil: mraleph: I know it accepts it because node-websocket-server has been using 0xBF for a while now.
[13:26] V1: micheil: I wanna bet, if you create a pull request for it.. It will be accepted :P

[13:28] bradleymeck: __filename
[13:28] mraleph: micheil: ok. I recommend just filing a bug.

[13:33] konobi: eldar__: tias
[13:33] floby: akashiraffee: what do you mean?
[13:34] floby: akashiraffee: 404 is a HTTP method
[13:34] eldar__: sorry, what does 'tias' mean?
[13:34] akashiraffee: Like, the quiv of returning HTTP_NOT_FOUND in apache -- so the server will return an HTTP "not found"...I guess I can just write the res header...
[13:34] konobi: eldar__: assuming you use r.js... then i would assume it would be the same way you deal with it in any normal requirejs module
[13:35] bradleymeck: eldar__ im not seeing any public ways to get it, add a feature request?
[13:35] broofa has joined the channel
[13:35] floby: akashiraffee: yes, if you're working with vanilla HTTP server you have to send the HTTP code yourseld. Connect and express will send it for you if none of your middleware is handling the request
[13:35] PeterEvjan has joined the channel
[13:36] eldar__: yeah, I should do. thank you. The reason why I want to use r.js it's because I use it on the client side and it would be nice to have a single solution

[13:37] bentkus has joined the channel
[13:37] akashiraffee: floby: yeah, I'm using express but I wanna process a form, and one of the fields is for a file, if we don't have it, I want to just return 404 to the client
[13:37] akashiraffee: a manual 404, if you will
[13:37] eldar__: konobi, I don't know. I don't need it on the client side
[13:38] akashiraffee: okay there's statusCode
[13:38] konobi: eldar__: try using the variable "fileName"
[13:38] eldar__: it doesn't work
[13:39] bradleymeck: its in the context arguments of require, you can do some funky hacks to get it, but i would advise against it
[13:39] springmeyer has joined the channel
[13:39] floby: akashiraffee: then just stop processing anything once you've detected that you can't handle the request and just call next(). provided no other middleware will handle the request. I *think* there is a way to specify an error to next so that the HTTP code will be what you want it to be. I'm looking for it
[13:39] konobi: eldar__: yeah, drop james a line then

[13:41] tokumine has joined the channel
[13:43] akashiraffee: floby: okay, what am I calling "next" on -- the server object?
[13:45] floby: akashiraffee: next is the third argument provided to request handlers in connect/express. your handler should look like : function(req, res, next) {...} it's sort of a callback. You call it when your handler cannot handle the request and the current request should be passed to the next middleware

[14:44] tmedema: And since it seems to work, I wonder when one has to do the " use app.router " line
[14:44] floby: tmedema: http://expressjs.com/guide.html#routing should tell you what you need to know
[14:44] tmedema: or express.router(), not sure really
[14:44] floby: oh
[14:45] tmedema: floby: I read that about 4 times
[14:45] floby: it's because router is a connect middleware which is included by default in express

[14:45] floby: tmedema: sorry I thought you were looking at the examples folder in the repository
[14:45] tmedema: floby: one thing though, what does the line app.router do at http://expressjs.com/guide.html#configuration?
[14:46] stagas: tmedema: you do: app.use(app.router) to tell it when to process the routes you give it
[14:46] stagas: ie you put it before express.static()
[14:47] tmedema: stagas: that confuses me, is app.router a set variable?

[14:48] bsparks has joined the channel
[14:48] stagas: everything you do with app.get() app.post() etc. is the app.router middleware
[14:49] tmedema: stagas: so what exactly does app.use(app.router) do? I think you tried to explain this, but I'm afraid I missed the concept
[14:50] stagas: tmedema: it places the routes in the middleware stack
[14:50] bradleymeck: it routes requests to different handlers based upon url/method with some url validation

[14:51] bzinger has joined the channel
[14:52] tmedema: stagas: oh, and if I don't call app.use(app.router) at all that means the routes are set after initialisation?

[15:40] eazyigz: Is there a sensible way to query a mongodb collection without having to define a schema first?
[15:40] eazyigz: I tried mongoose, but that is a pain in the ass with its lack of documentation
[15:40] wink_: eazyigz: what?
[15:40] davidsklar has joined the channel
[15:40] eazyigz: and node-mongodb-native is too complicated
[15:40] eazyigz: wink_: have you heard of mongodb?
[15:40] eazyigz: have you used it with node.js?
[15:40] wink_: yes to both, your question just doesn't make a lot of sense :p
[15:41] wink_: what are you trying to do exactly?
[15:41] eazyigz: wink_: very simple: in php or in python you connect to a database and get a cursor, then you can find items in the cursor
[15:41] eazyigz: it seems that with mongoose I have to actually define a model/schema first!
[15:41] eazyigz: which isn't practical, because what if I don't know the schema in advance?
[15:41] tmedema: Does express not look for view/template files in the directory of the script itself? If not, where does it look? I'm doing app.render('index.jade'); but it gives me a 500 yet the index.jade file is in the same directory as the server js file
[15:42] briznad has joined the channel
[15:42] wink_: well mongoose is a mongo orm i thought?
[15:42] tmedema: res.render *
[15:42] wink_: it's not just a mongo driver, its a full ORM layer on top of a mongo driver
[15:42] eazyigz: wink_: i don't want to bother with ORM definitions.  I just want to connect to a db and run a query
[15:42] floby: tmedema: have you generated your express app with the command line utility ?
[15:42] eazyigz: is that possible from node.js?
[15:42] Charuru has joined the channel
[15:42] wink_: absolutely, but you said it was too complicated?

[15:45] wink_: you can strip alot of that one out
[15:45] floby: tmedema: good. Then I think it looks by default in the views folder. you can override this by doing app.set('views', "/path/to/your/views/directory");
[15:45] wink_: for example, you probably dont want to drop the collection everytime
[15:45] wink_: you probably dont need all the random inserts
[15:46] eazyigz: shaunau_: thanks
[15:46] wink_: you really only need the db.open( db.collection( ))
[15:46] shaunau_: eazyigz: np
[15:46] tmedema: floby: alright, am I missing something here or am I supposed to know all this by feeling? Asking since I do not understand how everyone knows these things as I cannot find them in the docs!
[15:46] tmedema: Or maybe it's in the actual code examples
[15:47] tmedema: I only read the online examples
[15:47] shaunau_: tmedema have you looked at expressjs.com?
[15:47] tmedema: shaunau_: yes :)
[15:47] shaunau_: watched the vids?
[15:47] floby: tmedema: I read the whole documentation once =D  and used it a lot so I don't know where I learned this or that. but you can generate an app witt `express yourapp` and it generates a nicely organised app which works out of the box

[15:57] floby: gzmask: you can recode operators in C++

[15:57] gzmask: wink_: exactly
[15:58] tbranyen: wait you should be able to?
[15:58] shaunau_: can you run a hello world on it?
[15:59] tbranyen: doesn't it just wrap it to v8::Array
[15:59] tbranyen: and then you can extract values out of that
[15:59] shaunau_: maybe its just a corrupt node install
[15:59] bradleymeck: gzmask look at externalarrays (wont work on all arrays so read up)
[15:59] shaunau_: repl?
[15:59] mattrobenolt: Ok, I've narrowed down my kernel panic to something with Node and Redis. Not sure who's to blame here.
[15:59] ckknight: read-eval-print-loop
[15:59] wink_: you can definitely access them, but you're not going to get an int array for free :p

[16:10] shaunau_: just reading the stacktrace
[16:10] shaunau_: and looking at the code
[16:10] mattrobenolt: It's 1.2.6. I'm using things specifically from 2.x I believe.
[16:11] shaunau_: heh
[16:11] mattrobenolt: Wow.
[16:11] mattrobenolt: But to cause a kernel panic… that's scary.
[16:12] shaunau_: lots of things can cause a KP

[16:15] mattrobenolt: You can grab a .deb package here: http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/r/redis/
[16:15] mattrobenolt: And install that directly.

[16:16] mw0: when modifying a npm-packaged node library, what's the done thing with respect to the version specified in package.json?
[16:17] shaunau_: time to bolt. \0 cya.
[16:17] mw0: i don't want to just bump it, because then there could be a conflict with upstream later on
[16:17] Aria: mw0: "follow semver"?
[16:17] Aria: Usually, if you're forking, you rename the package...
[16:18] mw0: Aria: not sure what you mean by "follow semver".
[16:18] Aria: Or you develop using npm link, (or just install local to the project using npm1.0)
[16:18] Aria: Then get the upstream author to change versions when they publish it.
[16:18] tommoor has left the channel
[16:18] mw0: Aria: also, it isn't really a fork - i've submitted a patch to upstream, so hopefully i won't need to maintain my private branch for long
[16:18] Somebi has joined the channel
[16:18] Aria: So it's a short-lived fork ;-)
[16:18] Somebi: Hello everyone
[16:18] mw0: Aria: if you want to call it that, yeah :)
[16:18] Aria: I'd install locally using the current version from your repo -- npm linked or such.

[16:23] Aria: mw0: So ship a bundled version until you can safely make a reference.
[16:23] Somebi: when i'm adding some cyrillic symbols the output is wrong :|
[16:24] mw0: Aria: yeah, grumble.  
[16:24] Somebi: when removing them, output is fine and nothing is cut off
[16:24] mw0: Aria: i think what i really want is something equivalent to Release: in rpm
[16:24] drspin has joined the channel
[16:24] Aria: Yeah. It sucks, depending on specifics of a bleeding edge. I think that's a hard problem no matter what, but at least npm gives you tools to deal with that.
[16:25] tmedema: Anywhere I can look for details of Express's layout system? I am trying to use a view inside my general layout but setting eg. div=body actually converts the content of individual view to html codes (eg. & becomes &amp;)
[16:25] Aria: Yeah, sadly, semver style doesn't have a release: marker, and even in RPM, it just moves the conflict to a new field.
[16:25] Aria: A "less important" field, but still the same problem.
[16:26] mw0: even better, imo, would be a tool equivalent to cpan2rpm, or setup.py --record-rpm
[16:26] Aria: How so?
[16:26] tjholowaychuk: tmedema: !=
[16:26] Aria: Just to make a binary package?
[16:26] tjholowaychuk: tmedema: = escapes in jade
[16:26] Aria: .oO(I should so write that tool.)
[16:26] mw0: Aria: yeah, one package manager to deal with on production systems
[16:26] Aria: .oO(Considering I manage an RPM-based distro.)
[16:26] Aria: Yeah. I am SO with you on that. I think it's entirely orthagonal to the versioning problem you're solving, but ... yeah.
[16:26] Aria: I think that tool needs to exist.
[16:27] tmedema: tjholowaychuk: oh, a response from the author himself! great things you've made man, and thanks a lot
[16:27] tjholowaychuk: tmedema: np. it's a security feature lol since most people just chuck = = = = = = everywhere, they have to actually think about what they want to explicitly pass through
[16:28] mw0: Aria: definitely.  i started having a go at it last week, but didn't get very far.
[16:28] tmedema: tjholowaychuk: I see, so my general impression that one has to use something like div#content!=body with Express's layout system is correct, in order to make it render individual views?
[16:29] mbrevoort:  tjholowaychuk: using cluster, loving it, but been seeing a lot of orphaned worker processes through the day after continually starting and stopping. What's the preferred way to stop cluster?
[16:29] tjholowaychuk: tmedema: layouts are optional but yeah that is the typical use-case
[16:29] tmedema: alright, great
[16:29] mape: tjholowaychuk: was using stylus and for some reason I _THINK_ it was rounding up decimal values, like letter-spacing: 0.3px; is that "possible" or was it something else being wonky?
[16:29] tjholowaychuk: mbrevoort: either via signal (SIGTERM, SIGQUIT, etc) or the cli plugin, or the repl
[16:29] mw0: Aria: anyway, the problem boils down to Version/Release numbers assuming more or less sequential updates, which is a less valid assumption than it used to be
[16:30] tjholowaychuk: mbrevoort: ex $ node app.js stop
[16:30] tjholowaychuk: mbrevoort: kill -quit PID etc
[16:30] tjholowaychuk: mape: hmm yeah I think it might be for px
[16:30] mw0: Aria: i don't think anyone has a great answer to that in the context of reproducably installable packages
[16:30] mape: tjholowaychuk: then that is horrible.. :P
[16:30] colinclark has joined the channel
[16:30] Aria: Yeah. And that's a hard problem to solve -- you then have to describe versions either by feature-list, or by exacting hash.
[16:31] tjholowaychuk: mape: doesnt have to, it's like a 5 character change
[16:31] mape: tjholowaychuk: how so?
[16:31] tjholowaychuk: mape: in stylus, I can remove that
[16:31] mape: I mean is it intended to be like that?
[16:31] Aria: Managing dependencies in the PLD linux distro, we just work hard to work with upstream, work to make sure that changes get pushed out upstream as quickly as possible, so we don't have to maintain so much
[16:31] mape: What is the reasoning behind it?
[16:31] Aria: And we work to make that tree of changes as linear as possible, really.
[16:32] mape: tjholowaychuk: it isn't a big deal, just when customers ask for pixel perfect things like sub pixel values on letter-spacing and line-height is useful (even though it only works in firefox from what I can tell)
[16:32] mw0: Aria: nod, it was the same when i did opensuse stuff for a living
[16:32] dmcquay has joined the channel
[16:32] tjholowaychuk: mape: FF just probably renders differently so it looks correct
[16:32] tjholowaychuk: mape: one sec
[16:32] mbrevoort: tjholowaychuk: ok, does it make sense that there would be orphan's if I'm ctrl-Cing it? 
[16:33] mw0: Aria: but it would get progressively trickier as distros that we had to maintain aged, and we had to backport bugfixes but otherwise keep (most) versions as they were on release
[16:33] tjholowaychuk: mbrevoort: if it has restarted CTRL-C wont send it the signal
[16:33] tjholowaychuk: mbrevoort: because it's in the background
[16:33] mbrevoort: tjholowaychuk: I'll start using node app.js stop - thanks!
[16:34] mape: tjholowaychuk: well it renders sub-pixel yeah, but why is it stylus rounds thing? Not whining just curious on the implementation
[16:34] tjholowaychuk: mape: 9de25d8
[16:34] tjholowaychuk: mape: just an oversight by me haha
[16:34] mape: tjholowaychuk: Hehe k, awsome, thanks.
[16:35] Aria: mw0: Exactly. It's pain, especially with release forks for distros that then stay unchanging mostly.

[16:48] brianc: i did this already "log.debug = log.info = log.warn = log.error = console.log.bind(console);"
[16:48] isaacs: brianc: i have a somewhat fancy logger i use in npm.  you're welcome to abstract it out as a standalone module.
[16:48] isaacs: brianc: in fact, it'd be really much appreciated.
[16:48] Aria: mw0: Either the ability to spit out an RPM directly, or a spec and then call rpmbuild. Either would be pretty easy -- it's mostly a templating job for the latter method
[16:48] isaacs: brianc: it does colors and whatnot
[16:48] brianc: isaacs: awesomeness. i love that logger. I'll look into that asap (ap being sometime in the next week hopefully)
[16:49] isaacs: brianc: there are some aspects of it that are somewhat less intuitive than i'd like, so it's a fair bit of work to a) clean it up a bit, and b) change the bazillions of places in npm where it's used to use the saner api you design

[16:51] isaacs: brianc: in particular, you'd have to make it a lot more npm-agnostic.  maybe a standalone object that emits "log" events as well as writing to some fd you give it, and then have the npm config stuff moved into where npm implements a logger.

[18:02] deinspanjer: just doing a make and make install of nodejs isn't enough, I also need to install npm and then do an npm install express?
[18:02] isaacs: deinspanjer: or you need to install express "somehow"
[18:03] isaacs: deinspanjer: don't let the npmafia tell you that you npmust install with npm

[18:03] mscdex: it looks like maptail's package.json is missing dependencies
[18:03] isaacs: mscdex: yeah, that's a pita.
[18:04] isaacs: if it does'nt run without express, itshould list express as a dependency
[18:04] isaacs: especially since there are versions of express that are not api-compatible.

[18:05] deinspanjer: Why would maptail require openssl?
[18:05] V1: crypto module
[18:05] V1: if you don't have openssl installed you can't use the crypto module for md5 etc
[18:05] deinspanjer: I guess I wasn't thinking about it needing to encrypt anything.
[18:06] mscdex: probably because socket.io uses crypto for secure websockets support
[18:06] mscdex: i'm guessing
[18:06] V1: I think socket.Io needs it to for websockets
[18:06] mscdex: if you have socket.io installed already
[18:06] stagas: is there a package.json generator? :P
[18:06] deinspanjer: hrm. okay, Gonna have to take a step back and figure out how to get openssl-devel on this machine.

[18:17] kkaefer: I'll check that out first
[18:17] isaacs: kkaefer: but, that being said, there *will* always be *some* duplication, so you cannot rely on require("foo") being the same "foo" as in another package.

[18:27] stonecobra: isaacs: we agree on the automagic module loading idea, I won't reply again saying I agree :)
[18:27] XaKBooT: 80 thousand queries per second on laptop it's too fast
[18:27] micheil: luisloaiza: there's not really any good way to compare mysql and redis.
[18:28] kkaefer: isaacs: it seems the non-duplication breaks linked modules
[18:28] micheil: luisloaiza: your database should match your data, not the other way round
[18:28] luisloaiza: mmm ok but maybe in a particular scenario one is better than other?
[18:28] kkaefer: because they resolve in their original path, not the symlinked path they're called from
[18:28] tmedema has joined the channel
[18:28] micheil: choosing a database solely on "speed" is a stupid idea.
[18:28] luisloaiza: is not because of that
[18:28] micheil: luisloaiza: redis handles really well when your data is key/value pairs
[18:29] micheil: mysql is often really good for more relational data
[18:29] luisloaiza: I´m developing a real time update wall
[18:29] kkaefer: I guess in node's resolver there's one call too many to realpath
[18:29] micheil: postgres is also a good choice for more relational data
[18:30] micheil: luisloaiza: it depends really what features you want, ie, twitter uses a custom db for that, iirc.
[18:30] XaKBooT: luisloaiza belive my practice: i used redis to make modifyed clone of twitter basen on retwis

[18:59] c4milo: mikegerwitz: I am reading that but still I don't understand 
[19:00] c4milo: mikegerwitz: I have a private project and I ran npm install . and all the dependencies where installed in the local node_modules folder 
[19:01] micheil: Croms_: I use a text editor, like textmate
[19:01] mikegerwitz: c4milo: If you attempt to require() a module, node will begin to work backward in the directory tree in search of a node_modules folder. Once it finds it, it will attempt to load the module you require()'d. It's intended to be used for dependencies
[19:01] isaacs: c4milo: also, http://blog.nodejs.org/2011/03/23/npm-1-0-global-vs-local-installation/

[19:02] stonecobra: isaacs: thx
[19:02] mellowsoon has joined the channel
[19:02] isaacs: micheil: deepEqual doesn't work?
[19:03] micheil: I don't think so.
[19:03] isaacs: micheil: hm.  that's what test/simple/test-buffer.js does
[19:03] mellowsoon: 3,1Can someone tell me if addListener() is the same as on(), and if addListener() is depreciated?
[19:03] mellowsoon: 3,1damn
[19:03] mellowsoon: Sorry about the colors
[19:03] micheil: AssertionError: <Buffer ff 00> deepEqual <Buffer ff 00>
[19:03] c4milo: isaacs: so here is my question: in package.json how can I specify which packages I want to install global and which ones local? 
[19:03] isaacs: mellowsoon: on === addListener
[19:04] isaacs: (same actual function, i believE)
[19:04] isaacs: and on is shorter and thus betterer
[19:04] niclone has joined the channel
[19:04] isaacs: c4milo: you don't do that.
[19:04] c4milo: isaacs: clam 
[19:04] mellowsoon: I see addListner() in older examples, but on() in newer. So I was assuming addListener() is being depreciated
[19:04] mikegerwitz: micheil: It seems to work with me. assert.deepEqual( new Buffer( 'str' ), new Buffer( 'str' ) );
[19:04] isaacs: c4milo: in your package.json, you specify what your package depends on.  npm will make sure that you require() their modules when you require() and you bin their bins when you scripts
[19:04] c4milo: isaacs: expresso is a dependency of my project
[19:04] insin has joined the channel
[19:05] V1: it's a dependency of you test suite, not of your project
[19:05] isaacs: npm will put the locally-installed expresso's bins in  ./node_modules/.bin, and put that folder at the start of the PATH when you do `npm test foo`
[19:05] isaacs: c4milo: also, expresso should probably be a devDependency, not a dependency
[19:05] Croms_: michell / mikegerwitz: I understand that. ;—) But let's say i have an external .json file and i want to replace / add a value, how do i write to it?
[19:05] isaacs: unless you actually use it in production, and not just for testing.
[19:06] mikegerwitz: Croms_: If it's not a massive file, I'd just load it, JSON.parse() it, modify it and JSON.stringify() it.
[19:06] mikegerwitz: Croms_: Otherwise, I haven't had to do that.
[19:06] micheil: mikegerwitz: hmm.. that works, but it doesn't work.
[19:06] isaacs: c4milo: or, you can just install expresso manually, and run it manually, i mean, that works, too
[19:07] c4milo: isaacs: long discussion, the thing is that we have a automatic deployment and the tests should pass before actually deploy the app. That's why I have expresso as dependency
[19:07] isaacs: install it globally manually
[19:07] mikegerwitz: micheil: heh, I'm not sure I understand? ;)
[19:07] micheil: I'm not sure I understand either.
[19:07] mikegerwitz: micheil: require( 'assert' ).deepEqual( new Buffer( '\x00\x04', 'binary' ), new Buffer( '\x00\x04', 'binary' ) );
[19:07] c4milo: isaacs: ok, I will see what to do, I just wanted to make sure I was understanding well the mess 
[19:07] isaacs: c4milo: npm install foo --npat <-- this will run `npm test foo` before allowing the install to complete.
[19:07] mikegerwitz: micheil: that seems to work too
[19:07] micheil: *confused*
[19:07] isaacs: c4milo: also, --npat will install devDependencies
[19:07] micheil: nodeunit seems to be dying over it.
[19:08] mikegerwitz: micheil: Just note that it'll throw an exception on failure, not return a boolean result
[19:08] c4milo: isaacs: I will take a look at it, thank you 
[19:08] isaacs: c4milo: also, --npat will (eventually) automagically upload test results and metadata to a server so that the author can fix stuff

[19:11] tmedema: tjholowaychuk: aye, it's great, I did not notice all the examples on github, merely looked at the documentation but the examples make things extra clear..

[19:12] dmcquay has joined the channel
[19:12] isaacs: for now, it's just a test-on-install flag.  when it uploads to a server, it's gonna be SUPER rad
[19:12] mikegerwitz: isaacs: nice (npat)
[19:12] tjholowaychuk: tmedema: the template itself will not compile more than once in production, but the render is not cached
[19:12] tjholowaychuk: tmedema: they are intended more for dynamic uses, not just including other strings
[19:12] isaacs: CI isn't something that you should have to work at a boring company or write Java to get.
[19:13] isaacs: i think perl got it so right on this one
[19:13] tmedema: tjholowaychuk: ah right, so I better put the actual header/footer code in the layout file? I figured partials were nice for this purpose too as they allow one to separate the layout into building blocks
[19:14] tjholowaychuk: tmedema: we should probaly have something else for that, although it will work https://github.com/visionmedia/express/issues/623

[19:31] tmedema: alright, have to take a look at it, shame I never really tried the MVC pattern though
[19:31] tjholowaychuk: tmedema: pretty simple, just put output related logic in the template, and business logic in the route
[19:32] tmedema: tjholowaychuk: but then I'd have to create separate route files for each view?

[19:39] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: hahahah yeah dont ask me
[19:40] tjholowaychuk: so weird

[20:08] hvgotcodes: yes
[20:08] isaacs: so?
[20:08] V1: aleksey: socket.io is the client library project, socket.io-node is the node.js server that can accept connections from the client
[20:08] hvgotcodes: isaacs: is it case sensitive?
[20:09] hvgotcodes: the view with xmlhttprequest worked, but XMLHttpRequest did not
[20:09] isaacs: hvgotcodes: yes
[20:09] isaacs: hvgotcodes: javascript is case sensitive
[20:09] V1: aleksey: but socket.io-node bundles the socket.io client so you don't have to pay attention to that project ;)
[20:09] isaacs: so are many operating systems.
[20:09] hvgotcodes: im totally confused becasue my require works on os x but not on my vm
[20:09] isaacs: hvgotcodes: that's because os x is not one of those operating systems :)
[20:09] hvgotcodes: which is lucid32
[20:09] isaacs: right
[20:09] hvgotcodes: ok then
[20:09] isaacs: linux is case sensitive
[20:10] isaacs: os x is not
[20:10] systemfault: OSX, depends...
[20:10] isaacs: so, when node stat's the file, and opens it, and reads it, it all "works" with XMLHttpRequest or XmlHTTPReQuEsT etc

[20:23] robertkeizer: hvgotcodes: 127.0.0.1 is the address of lo, the loopback address in *nix. It will work with linux.
[20:23] hvgotcodes: robertkeizer: what about localhost
[20:24] robertkeizer: hvgotcodes: localhost is the domain name of your local machine. It resolves to 127.0.0.1 in ipv4.
[20:25] hvgotcodes: different question: if i do http.createServer(function()...).listen(...) and then immediately start pinging it in the same script, can some sort of timing issue occur in that the server isnt up before the first request comes in?
[20:25] blueadept: having some trouble with this hash feature, would anyone happen to know how i can apply it to the password field of the user object? http://pastie.org/private/5jegjuc4ogvx46qgy4fuw
[20:25] hvgotcodes: basically i can ping a server with wget, but not from the script that launches the server
[20:26] robertkeizer: hvgotcodes: ping is ICMP, wget is TCP/IP, what kind of ping are you doing?
[20:26] hvgotcodes: ah, and if i take the assert out which kills the test, i see a connection refused followed by the appropriate responses
[20:26] hvgotcodes: ping in the general sense, specifically using the xmlhttprequest 
[20:26] FireFly has joined the channel
[20:27] RushPL has joined the channel
[20:27] robertkeizer: hvgotcodes: ping in the gernal sense is the command 'ping' which sends icmp request to the given address, specifically an echo request.

[20:28] fairwinds has joined the channel
[20:29] robertkeizer: Depending on how you wrote the code, it could be asynchronous vs synchronous.
[20:29] hvgotcodes: mikegerwitz: no im not sure, in fact im suspecting its not done, hence the error
[20:29] robertkeizer: So the first part of the code isn't actually executed by the time the 2nd part of the code is executed.
[20:29] robertkeizer: If you post what you have to github / gist I'll take a look if you want.

[20:56] luisloaiza: is there something like try catch
[20:56] luisloaiza: in
[20:56] luisloaiza: nodeJS
[20:56] luisloaiza: ?¿
[20:57] luisloaiza: bluedept,, nodejs is like a normal web server, you can call a action request that respond a json with that info
[20:58] bcelenza: luisloaiza: try/catch exists.. looks a little like this: https://gist.github.com/910730
[20:58] bcelenza: use the global Error object when possible
[20:59] tbranyen: bcelenza: whys that?
[20:59] beriberikix: So besides a framework like Expression, what other libs are handy for daily coding? I know of underscorejs.
[20:59] tbranyen: using the global Error
[20:59] bcelenza: tbranyen: no specific reason other than it seems to be the standard
[20:59] tbranyen: bcelenza: hmmm wonder if there are any added benefits to that over, throw "error"
[21:00] luisloaiza: how is used?
[21:00] luisloaiza: the global error
[21:00] luisloaiza: i mean when a function trows and error my server ends to run
[21:00] luisloaiza: stop running
[21:00] tbranyen: ohhh bcelenza there is a benefit
[21:01] tbranyen: http://sharefilewith.me/u/841735.png
[21:01] bcelenza: im searching for the docs on the object :) coming up short
[21:01] tbranyen: throw new Error gives you an error object in the catch block
[21:01] tbranyen: throw "error" gives you a useless string
[21:01] tbranyen: interesting
[21:01] tbranyen: i'd assume the string would get wrapped, but i guess not
[21:01] bcelenza: Yeah, you can also assign an error code to your exceptions as well
[21:01] tbranyen: dope, i'm sold on that
[21:01] tbranyen: that seems like the right thing to do
[21:02] luisloaiza: so i use a normal try catch
[21:02] luisloaiza: sintaz
[21:02] bcelenza: luisloaiza: a try/catch  might not help you in that situation. for catching all uncaught exceptions, check out the process module 'uncaughtException' event: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.4/api/process.html#event_uncaughtException_
[21:02] luisloaiza: sintax
[21:02] tbranyen: syntax :)

[21:46] Aria: If you put things in by date and time ;-)
[21:46] blueadept: does anyone have a good case for either underscore or camelcase conventions? or is it just personal preference?
[21:46] Aria: You might want to do the aggregation as you put data in -- increment various statistics, etc. Or do a map-reduce type model, where you look for new data adn fold it in.
[21:46] Aria: blueadept: personal preference. 
[21:47] bnoguchi: techwraith: Yes, store your data as an ordered set where the score is the datetime
[21:47] blueadept: sometimes i think underscores are just easier to read
[21:47] blueadept: but sometimes i see code where really good coders use camelcase
[21:47] blueadept: so its like, wtf
[21:48] techwraith: bnoguchi: Have a link for that?
[21:48] bnoguchi: techwraith: No. If I were you, I would read up on redis fundamentals
[21:48] techwraith: k :)
[21:48] bnoguchi: techwraith: and then figure out how you want to store your data
[21:48] insin: blueadept: I just use whatever the conventions for the language and its std lib are

[22:19] tmedema: tjholowaychuk: 40k lines of css? may I ask what website is using that much css?

[22:20] tbranyen: 40k isn't that uncommon
[22:20] tjholowaychuk: not at all no
[22:21] coreb: 40k sounds a lot
[22:21] ryah: coreb: tls runs on top of tcp
[22:21] Kuroir1: 40k sounds like a weird case of many classes
[22:21] tmedema: well considering that the point of css is to avoid repetition I'd say 40k lines is quite a lot
[22:21] Kuroir1: or statements..
[22:21] coreb: ryah; you don't say ;)
[22:21] Kuroir1: or tabbed..
[22:21] ryah: coreb: well - define 'socket layer' then
[22:21] tbranyen: the point of css is to style, so if you have a lot of things to style
[22:21] tbranyen: then yea you end up with a lot of css
[22:22] tmedema: but I see your point, I guess switching to a css compiler is not a huge step so I could just start with normal css while the app is still relatively small
[22:22] tjholowaychuk: yup
[22:22] piscisaureus: ryah: are we also going to put child processes in oio?
[22:22] Kuroir1: 40k, sounds like a lot. Probably too many overrides?
[22:22] tjholowaychuk: and most support the css-like syntax as well
[22:22] ryah: piscisaureus: that's the plan
[22:22] Kuroir1: I uses sass.scss <3

[22:38] AAA_awright: Yeah it would be a modification to the compiler
[22:38] tjholowaychuk: AAA_awright: well what are you trying to do
[22:38] tjholowaychuk: oh ok
[22:39] tjholowaychuk: AAA_awright: just look at the "nodes" dir, its pretty basic stuff, block has several nodes, each node can be say a Tag, or another Block etc

[22:43] tjholowaychuk: AAA_awright: I dont really know what you are trying to do. why not just use jade for the xml as-is?
[22:43] AAA_awright: quackquack: There's no system function that does it, rm recurses, Node.js would have to recurse too
[22:43] Casperin: isaacs: I found out that it's a different problem than I thought it was :P — I did manage to install it, but for whatever reason, node only works in the actual terminal that I*m using to install it
[22:43] coreb: ryah: yes, it's ssl2/ssl3/tls1 doing it, point was unencrypted data over the wire
[22:43] deebo: can someone explain: http://pastebin.com/r6dcYpCf
[22:43] quackquack: AAA_awright: okay, thanks!
[22:44] isaacs: Casperin: which node <-- what is that?
[22:44] sorens3n has joined the channel
[22:44] isaacs: Casperin: what does that command output?
[22:44] SubStack: quackquack: also get exec like this: var exec = require('child_process').exec
[22:44] Casperin: isaacs: /Users/g/local/node/bin/node
[22:44] isaacs: deebo: the first is just losing the reference to the exports object
[22:44] quackquack: SubStack: excellent, thank you!
[22:44] isaacs: deebo: do:   module.exports = whatever
[22:45] deebo: isaacs: ah! true
[22:45] SubStack: quackquack: well you could use findit to get a recursive list of files and fs.unlink() each of those but shelling out to rm probably works faster and more relia bly
[22:45] marcello3d has joined the channel
[22:45] isaacs: deebo: also: that module pattern thingie is overkill.  node modules are already wrapped in a closure

[22:45] marcello3d: HELLO JENTLEMEN

[22:45] deebo: isaacs: probably, am just used to it and gave it a go
[22:45] isaacs: deebo: if you do "var a = 100" in a module, it won't be a globaly.
[22:47] isaacs: Casperin: ok.  and does your $PATH environment var contain /Usrs/g/local/node/bin?
[22:47] isaacs: Casperin: echo $PATH
[22:48] Casperin: yeah
[22:48] AAA_awright: tjholowaychuk: I'm trying to make a templating language even higher language than Javascript expressions inside Jade... to do the transforms/templating in DOM or whatever, before it generates the actual XML. Detect for-each elements and know to use a Javascript for loop, etc
[22:48] Casperin: isaacs: /Users/g/local/node/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:  + more
[22:49] isaacs: Casperin: ok.  then why can't node be found...?
[22:49] isaacs: Casperin: are you running with sudo or something?
[22:49] tjholowaychuk: AAA_awright: oh I see, then yeah you would need a Visitor that implements visitTag() and check the attrs etc, same with visitCode
[22:49] AAA_awright: er, one that operates on a higher level than Javascript
[22:49] Casperin: isaacs: I really don't know… I've had the same problem with mysql actually. Ended up doing aliases in .bash_profile
[22:49] Casperin: isaacs: Too much of a newbie to know exactly what I'm doing wrong :(
[22:50] isaacs: Casperin: well, unless you've set up an alias of some sort, then `which node` should be the node that gets run, and hte node that npm sees.
[22:51] AAA_awright: tjholowaychuk: Ah cool thanks
[22:51] Casperin: isaacs: well… "which node" only worked in the terminal after installing nodejs. Before that, no luck
[22:51] Casperin: isaacs: actually.. let me try something
[22:51] isaacs: Casperin: yeah.
[22:51] isaacs: because there wasn't a node before you installed it
[22:52] isaacs: Casperin: it's not there until you install it, so "which" won't find it
[22:52] Casperin: yes, but if i open a new terminal, then "which node" doesn't return anything
[22:53] Casperin: and it's not in the path of that terminal

[22:58] Casperin: isaacs: thanks for your help!
[22:58] isaacs: Casperin: you've learned a valuable lesson about setting environment variables.
[22:58] isaacs: Casperin: remember the power of "export".

[23:02] isaacs: the same can not be said for web browsers
[23:03] Casperin: I'd be without a job if it did :P

[23:42] tbranyen: ah right on
[23:42] samcday: Pre-emptive resource loading, to prevent wasted round trips asking for assets the server already knows you'll need.
