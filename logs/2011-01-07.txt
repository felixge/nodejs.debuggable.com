[00:01] bingomanatee_: node-inspector is set to 0.3.0 or later; I'm under the impression that 0.3.0 is not stable yet - how (un)stable3 is it?
[00:02] c4milo: bingomanatee: I think he meant in the master branch

[00:09] Aria: 0.3 is 'unstable' but works well most of the time. It's the new API, which is solidifying rapidly.
[00:11] soniczen has joined the channel
[00:11] ryah: bingomanatee_: if you're developing a new app i'd go with v0.3
[00:11] ryah: it will be v0.4 soon now
[00:12] c4milo: ryah: how stable is v0.3 for long running apps?
[00:13] squeek: Is there a clear and definitive set of guidelines for writing npm packages? I'm not just talking about package.json here, I'm talking about code/documentation guidelines, testing requirements, commenting etc.
[00:13] isaacs: squeek: no.
[00:13] isaacs: squeek: that's left up to your judgement and inclination.
[00:13] Aria: "Make good code. Ship it."
[00:14] Aria: "PS. Docs are nice."
[00:14] isaacs: squeek: `npm help json` will tell you how to expose those docs and tests
[00:14] squeek: Aria: "good" is a very, very subjective term.
[00:14] und3f has joined the channel
[00:14] isaacs: squeek: the subjectiveness is why npm doesn't seek to be an authority there.
[00:14] squeek: right now I've sorta been winging by looking at other people's, but it's really, really inconsistent.
[00:14] cafesofie has joined the channel
[00:14] squeek: isaacs: you can have guideline without authority. collective agreement, it's called.
[00:14] isaacs: squeek: i would maintain that it's inconsistent in all platforms, it's just that some hide that inconsistency from you.
[00:14] isaacs: npm does not.
[00:15] zomgbie has joined the channel
[00:15] isaacs: collectives are very bad at agreeing
[00:15] ryah: c4milo: the "unstable"-ness of v0.3 refers to API rather than perf
[00:15] ryah: v0.3 performs better than v0.2
[00:15] squeek: I'd agree towards the inconsistency, but I find that at least with some guidelines, some best practices there you can at least strive towards something someone says it the best way, as opposed to making your own mind up and failing horribly.
[00:15] saschagehlich has joined the channel
[00:15] squeek: maybe I'm just too indecisive.
[00:17] ryah: squeek: there isn't but we've been discussing this recently
[00:17] c4milo: ryah: my main concern is predictable stability, I don't want node hangs unexpectedly without any logic reason.
[00:17] ryah: i'd like to ratchet down what is considered a node module
[00:17] aconbere: hmpf
[00:18] aconbere: so I'm back to asking about running map reduce jobs via mongo-native :)

[00:18] soniczen: what is the flash() method used for?
[00:18] squeek: the other thing I'd love to see is package testing across versions/os's, but I'm dreaming.
[00:19] benburkert has joined the channel
[00:19] ryah: c4milo: well - i think you can expect more predictablity from v0.2 since it doesnt change.
[00:19] ryah: but we're not doing very wild stuff in v0.3
[00:19] ryah: mostly adding libraries
[00:20] c4milo: ryah: cool, reasonable answer :)
[00:20] isaacs: squeek: ok, how's this:  put js files in "lib", executables in "bin", markdown documentation in "doc".  write a package.json for it.  add a test script that can be run from the command line, and put it in your scripts.test field in package.json
[00:21] skm has joined the channel

[01:07] lukegalea: it's a very simple case: http://pastie.org/1435860

[01:17] lukegalea: aah.. turns out that vows always assumes the first argument in a call back is an error.
[01:17] isaacs: lukegalea: that is a godo pattern.
[01:18] isaacs: lukegalea: node works that way internally.  npm is completely written with that pattern.
[01:18] isaacs: it's pretty nice when it's consistent.
[01:18] lukegalea: ya, seems like in order to use vows you *have* to use that pattern. I can live with that ;)

[02:07] Chadams: um... I just ran make I'll have to check to see where it went

[03:14] pkrumins: i proxied it here
[03:14] pkrumins: it still keeps going
[03:14] softdrink: i'm just trying to get it to set the content-encoding and content-type for *.js.gz
[03:17] herbySk has joined the channel
[03:17] SubStack: call them hoxies
[03:17] SubStack: short for harmony proxies

[03:19] Liam_: If anyone's interested in node-to-node msg passing, i'm planning to write a simple module based on net.Streams which implements the packet format of the latest websocket protocol draft...
[03:19] SubStack: http://twitter.com/#!/substack/status/23217083579891713 
[03:19] pkrumins: it;s official guys!
[03:19] pkrumins: hoxies!
[03:20] SubStack: Liam_: why would you do that?
[03:20] bartt has joined the channel
[03:20] pyrotechnick1: wow
[03:20] pyrotechnick1: proxies look awesome
[03:21] pyrotechnick1: you can already emulate that though
[03:21] Liam_: SubStack: I need binary msg passing
[03:21] SubStack: Liam_: there are lots of modules that already do that
[03:21] Liam_: oh, do tell... i hadn't found any
[03:21] SubStack: like bson
[03:22] yrashk: Liam_: js-to-js msg passing is already available in beam.js :) but that's not node.js :)
[03:22] SubStack: also dnode!
[03:22] SubStack: ACTION shameless plug
[03:22] pkrumins: node-binary 
[03:23] Liam_: have seen dnode; rpc is a specific style
[03:24] yrashk: Liam_ https://img.skitch.com/20101225-m374mjh1cnp7ifya2srkab4qpk.jpg
[03:24] Liam_: and i need to pass non-js-object binary data
[03:24] SubStack: oh wait, if you just want to send raw binary data why not just use plain old streams?
[03:24] pyrotechnick1: SubStack: would dnode be fast enough for tealtime?
[03:24] pyrotechnick1: like > 50 FPS
[03:24] pyrotechnick1: between two nodes
[03:24] SubStack: pyrotechnick1: what is a tealtime
[03:24] pyrotechnick1: realtime* sorry
[03:24] pyrotechnick1: with just a simple message
[03:24] pyrotechnick1: maybe 50 bytes or so
[03:24] pkrumins: it can do 10 billion a sec.
[03:25] pyrotechnick1: what
[03:25] SubStack: no it can't
[03:25] pkrumins: why not!
[03:25] pyrotechnick1: pkrumins: dont be a troll
[03:25] pkrumins: haha ok
[03:25] SubStack: because it does a JSON.parse
[03:25] SubStack: and a JSON.stringify
[03:25] pyrotechnick1: it's not helpful :p
[03:25] pkrumins: oh. ok.
[03:25] Liam_: i need a plain old stream with msg len prefixing
[03:25] SubStack: and some other transforms
[03:25] pkrumins: ok, i didnt remember that
[03:25] SubStack: pyrotechnick1: I have some performance benchmarks someplace
[03:25] pyrotechnick1: SubStack: do you have any numbers substack
[03:25] pyrotechnick1: thanks mate
[03:25] pyrotechnick1: i mean
[03:25] pyrotechnick1: dont do it if you dont i can
[03:26] pyrotechnick1: i just thought id check with you first
[03:26] pyrotechnick1: we'll definitely use it between server client for some things
[03:26] pyrotechnick1: but im wondering about server server
[03:26] SubStack: oh this one only checks websocket rates
[03:26] pyrotechnick1: because that stuff really needs to be 60FPS or so or it will fail
[03:26] pyrotechnick1: between nodes
[03:26] pyrotechnick1: or between server client?
[03:26] pyrotechnick1: over the net or over local?
[03:26] broofa has joined the channel
[03:27] SubStack: well I think in either case your limiting factor will be the network
[03:27] SubStack: but it might help that everything is async
[03:27] softdrink: this no workie for me.. keeps 404-ing:  http://pastebin.com/j8uEM05b
[03:28] Liam_: so anyway yes, plain streams, but msgs are framed as in the latest websocket protocol draft
[03:28] Liam_: and i was a lilttle surprised not to find that already written
[03:29] SubStack: Liam_: I think somebody had a framing package on npm
[03:30] ryah: Liam_: https://gist.github.com/760755

[03:36] Liam_: ryah: thanks for the link. i'm not so much concerned with the data formatting as the basic framing and use of net.Stream
[03:38] Liam_: i.e. putting framed msgs onto a stream and then reassembly on other end
[03:39] markstory has joined the channel
[03:40] Liam_: and it seems like the new websocket framing is a decent approach
[03:40] SubStack: AAA_awright: success!
[03:40] SubStack: it's holding at fps
[03:40] SubStack: *at 50 fps
[03:40] SubStack: scaling the number of clients now
[03:40] Liam_: SubStack: dnode is?
[03:40] SubStack: oh whoops, I mean pyrotechnick1 
[03:40] AAA_awright: hah
[03:41] SubStack: yep
[03:41] AAA_awright: SubStack: Can I get a link anyways?
[03:41] SubStack: yeah in a sec

[03:47] SubStack: this is just locally however
[03:48] pyrotechnick1: SubStack: how much data
[03:48] SubStack: very small amount
[03:48] smtlaissezfaire has joined the channel
[03:49] SubStack: pyrotechnick1: here you can run the tests yourself https://github.com/substack/dnode/tree/master/examples/perf 
[03:50] Liam_: SubStack: you can compute the max number of clients for a given host with a test of json.parse performance, i imagine
[03:50] SubStack: Liam_: well dnode does some other transforms and bookkeeping
[03:51] Liam_: probably a modest %age of the parse expense
[03:51] Liam_: or stringify if the 50fps are outbound

[03:55] bingomanatee_: Question - when I upgraded to node 0.3.3, the nature of body variables changed.
[03:55] piscm has joined the channel
[03:55] bingomanatee_: When I name a form field "foo[bar]" it used to create nested objects in the request object. Now it returns them as passed (strings with brackets). 
[03:56] bingomanatee_: Was this a design decision or is this just a wierd side effect of something?

[04:07] Liam_: bingomanatee_: you mean the formatting of uploaded form data changed?
[04:08] Liam_: if so i think that would be due to a module like formidable
[04:08] dthompson has joined the channel
[04:09] Liam_: NemesisD: > func(input, function(data) { console.log(sys.inspect(data)) }) ?
[04:10] bingomanatee_: yes.
[04:10] cnus8n has joined the channel
[04:11] NemesisD: Liam_: i want to manipulate the data in the repl, printing and inspecting is not very productive
[04:12] Liam_: bingomanatee_: i don't think node core massages body data... i could be wrong...
[04:13] Liam_: NemesisD: var manipulatethis; func(input, function(data) { manipulatethis = data })
[04:13] bingomanatee_: well - when I had an "<input type="text" name="foo[bar]" />" in a form and posted,
[04:14] bingomanatee_: before I got req.body.foo.bar: "submitted Value";
[04:14] bingomanatee_: now I get req.body['foo[bar]'] = "submitted value".
[04:14] pyrotechnick1: it should be like that bingo
[04:15] bingomanatee_: I actually like v. 1 but I just want to know if this is an upgrade side effect or a fluke.

[04:27] bingomanatee_ has joined the channel
[04:27] Liam_: which one?
[04:28] NemesisD: Liam_: the latter
[04:28] Liam_: that sounds like a repl bug
[04:28] Liam_: that the former doesn't work...
[04:30] tjholowaychuk: bingomanatee_: req.body is an express thing
[04:30] tjholowaychuk: well bodyDecoder
[04:30] tjholowaychuk: but 0.3.x has a different querystring parser
[04:32] jamescarr: tjholowaychuk, give it a few months and it will just be like RoR...
[04:32] jamescarr: people will think express IS node.js

[04:32] tjholowaychuk: pfft
[04:32] tjholowaychuk: lol
[04:32] tjholowaychuk: I wont feel right releasing 2.0 until connect gets a major overhaul
[04:33] Liam_: NemesisD: when i try var x = null ... { x = data } it works for me
[04:34] NemesisD: maybe its this darn backbone
[04:35] jamescarr: tjholowaychuk, you work on Extjs for sencha?
[04:35] jamescarr: or just pure node.js stuff?
[04:35] tjholowaychuk: I dont work there anymore I left
[04:36] tjholowaychuk: but nope I just worked on node related stuff
[04:36] Liam_: NemesisD: i'm using 0.2.4
[04:36] Liam_: so if that doesn't work in 0.3 could be a bug...
[04:37] tjholowaychuk: jamescarr: cool company, but I wanted to make a bigger impact on node with opensource stuff
[04:38] tjholowaychuk: and be a larger part, of a smaller company
[04:38] tjholowaychuk: plus the guys at learnboost are really rad
[04:38] tjholowaychuk: to work with

[04:40] bingomanatee_: okay - so the 0.3.x querystring parser is different - by design - and I can build towards it going forward?
[04:40] tjholowaychuk: but that is to far away
[04:41] bingomanatee_: tjholowaychuk ^ ^
[04:41] tjholowaychuk: bingomanatee_: I still want the same behavior for express where user[name] == { user: { name: }}
[04:41] tjholowaychuk: but like ive mentioned I dont work on 0.3x
[04:41] bingomanatee_: okay

[04:52] shaver: tjholowaychuk: where in Canada are you?
[04:52] tjholowaychuk: SubStack: ah ok cool :)
[04:52] tjholowaychuk: shaver: Victoria

[04:53] SubStack: sweet!
[04:53] shaver: when is nodeconf?
[04:53] tjholowaychuk: right after (before?) jsconf I think
[04:53] tjholowaychuk: not sure if they are in a similar area
[04:53] softdrink: may 5
[04:53] tjholowaychuk: may something
[04:54] shaver: in oakland?
[04:54] SubStack: portland
[04:54] tjholowaychuk: damn, I was hoping they were close
[04:54] pkrumins: wow, jsconf and nodeconf
[04:54] pkrumins: right one after another
[04:54] SubStack: yep!
[04:54] pkrumins: so cool.
[04:54] pkrumins: also

[05:13] sechrist: tjholowaychuk: is tobi only compatible with nodejs based servers, or can it handle full uris?
[05:14] tjholowaychuk: sechrist: right now just node servers, but you can do new Browser(html) as well
[05:14] tjholowaychuk: I didnt really see a use-case otherwise
[05:14] sechrist: well I have one, and it's for a nagios script
[05:14] tjholowaychuk: I guess to test sites with other languages n shit

[06:59] Aria: As in configure the MS DNS server, or change nameservers?
[07:00] pkrumins: they are in registry
[07:00] sinisa: i got "could not contact DNS servers"
[07:00] pkrumins: and there is a reg.exe program that comes with windows that you can use to mess with registry values from the command line
[07:01] sinisa: i should change dns in registry so node will work?

[07:23] pkrumins: absolutely
[07:23] Aria: It's THE place for that.
[07:23] Ikaros: hah, kk, I'm having some trouble with EventEmitters
[07:23] Ikaros: var sys           = require('sys'),
[07:23] Ikaros:     events        = require('events');
[07:23] Ikaros: var Emission = module.exports = function () {
[07:23] Ikaros:   events.EventEmitter.call(this);
[07:24] Ikaros:   
[07:24] Ikaros:   this.cycles = 0;
[07:24] Ikaros: };
[07:24] Ikaros: sys.inherits(Emission, events.EventEmitter);
[07:24] Aria: Whoa, gist that next time!
[07:24] Ikaros: Emission.prototype.cycle = function () {
[07:24] Ikaros:   this.emit('recycle', ++this.cycles);
[07:24] Ikaros:   
[07:24] Ikaros:   var self = this;

[07:24] Ikaros:     self.cycle();
[07:24] Ikaros:   }, 0);
[07:24] Ikaros: };
[07:24] Ikaros: hmm, thats kinda messy
[07:24] Aria: You're being rate-limited by the server. It's gonna take a long time for that to finish appearing.
[07:24] Ikaros: yea, sry, figured the formatting would be better
[07:24] pkrumins: gist or pastebin
[07:25] jpld has joined the channel
[07:29] Ikaros: Ok, two files (truncated to include the important bits), emission.js (https://gist.github.com/769223) is imported by server.js (https://gist.github.com/769224)
[07:30] Ikaros: And it just emits events repeatedly... the problem is that it never emits the first event (cycles always prints at 2, never starting at 1 as expected)
[07:31] Aria: Well, you're calling yourself with no termination condition there.
[07:31] Aria: Is that what you want?
[07:32] Aria: And you're setting up your event handler after the first cycle has fired.

[07:34] perezd: any idea why a console.log would fire twice inside of an http.createServer callback?

[07:34] jimt_ has joined the channel
[07:35] whyme: perezd: via browser?
[07:35] perezd: what is causing this...it seems like the callback gets triggered twice
[07:35] perezd: chrome

[07:36] perezd: oh shiz
[07:36] perezd: good point
[07:36] perezd: hah
[07:36] perezd: I am too sleepy to code 
[07:36] perezd: evidently
[07:36] Ikaros: @Aria Yea, no termination was laziness for testing, Ctrl+C works fine for now :) Added the listener after the first call still starts at 2.
[07:37] Aria: Ikaros: What about if the cycle is after the listener?
[07:39] Ikaros: Hmm, yea, just tried that as you said and it didn't work, but now it appears to be
[07:40] Ikaros: Alright, well, it appears to be working consistently now. Changing the order makes sense. Thanks :)
[07:41] micheil has joined the channel
[07:42] Ikaros: Would there be any way I could move the first cycle() call inside of the Emission construct and still have it fire an event?
[07:42] niklasfi has joined the channel
[07:44] niklasfi: so i am watching a file with fs.watchFile()... but how do i  find out if a file has been deleted so i can call fs.unwatch()? Does that become evident in the curr argument?
[07:48] admc has joined the channel
[07:49] Ikaros: I'm still learning node so I'm not sure this is the right way  but you could try sys.puts(sys.inspect(curr)) and see if there is something useful there or path.exists inside the callback
[07:54] niklasfi: ikaros: the only thing that 'changes' is that whenever i update a file the timestamps change. when it is moved, they don't :)
[07:55] dguttman has joined the channel
[07:55] Ikaros: I'm not sure about moving a file but if nlink === 0, I think that means its been deleted ("nlink: The number of hard links to this file have changed.")
[07:56] niklasfi: ikaros... you are right
[07:57] niklasfi: ikaros: nlink changes to 0 as well when the file is moved

[08:00] pkrumins: AGECHANGE!
[08:00] sechrist: pkrumins: yo
[08:00] sechrist: for browserling
[08:00] pkrumins: yo
[08:01] sechrist: do you think you'll ever be able to get the input latency much lower?
[08:01] pkrumins: sechrist: where are you located?
[08:01] Ikaros: @niklasfi I don't see a watchFolder/Path. timer+readdir or path.exists would seem to be the only way
[08:01] sechrist: pkrumins: santa clara
[08:02] pkrumins: i havent looked at how fast it is today
[08:02] sechrist: it's around a second
[08:02] pkrumins: but we reduced latency significantly last week
[08:02] sechrist: between a hover or click
[08:02] sechrist: sometimes 2-2.5 seconds
[08:03] pkrumins: that's very high latency
[08:03] pkrumins: we have a trick we'll try soon
[08:03] pkrumins: that should get it down some more
[08:03] sechrist: that's not "real" latency
[08:03] sechrist: that's my interpretation of the timing
[08:03] sechrist: my ping to that rackspace ip is 56.9 ms
[08:04] pkrumins: actually i have a task in wedoist to measure what takes the most time
[08:04] pkrumins: havent goten to it yet
[08:04] pkrumins: sechrist: so as it's now, we have windows, then we have the api server (linux). so when you use it, you are on api server, it gets display from windows, encodes it to pngs
[08:04] mikeal has joined the channel
[08:05] pkrumins: sechrist: so the trick i want to try it, is make windows serve pngs or jepgs itself
[08:05] sechrist: ah I see
[08:05] pkrumins: that should make it faster
[08:05] sechrist: if you're base64 encoding the png in node
[08:05] sechrist: I found that to be damn slow for framebuffers
[08:06] sechrist: (I've done some node stuff for transmitting frames over websockets like this)
[08:06] sechrist: well not so much slow as it was cpu intensive I guess
[08:06] sechrist: just the encoding of 30fps 720p from rgb to png took up one of my i7 cores
[08:07] sechrist: though that may be attributed to string manipulation or whatever else
[08:07] mraleph has joined the channel
[08:08] pkrumins: we are base64 encoding the png in node, yes
[08:08] pkrumins: but not in js, i wrote a C module for that ages ago.
[08:08] pkrumins: well node,js eventually got its own base64 encoder
[08:08] pkrumins: but months later.
[08:08] sechrist: I think it's js implemented though

[08:12] pkrumins: sechrist: we use smart algorithms to minimize what gts encoded
[08:12] pkrumins: i havent blogged about it, but if there are, let's say, 7 updates throughout the screen
[08:12] dtrasbo has joined the channel
[08:12] pkrumins: i find the bounding rect, set that image to transparent, and then put those 7 regions on top of it
[08:12] pkrumins: send it to browser, and it overlays it on top of all other updates so far
[08:13] pkrumins: this way it's awesomely efficient

[08:17] fangel has joined the channel
[08:18] pkrumins: it produces a png that is the size of bounding rect of all updates, with everything being transparent, except where the updates where pushed to.

[08:59] ErikCorry: You have gcc but not g++
[08:59] ZiXon: what is the diff?
[08:59] ErikCorry: One is a C compiler and also the name of the GNU Compiler Collection
[09:00] ErikCorry: The other is a C++ compiler which happens to be part of the GNU Compiler Collection
[09:00] ErikCorry: The collection is sometimes called GCC

[09:00] ZiXon: didnt realize there is a diff

[09:15] statik has joined the channel
[09:17] felixge: ErikCorry: are you trying to reduce the time the GC will stop the world on a busy script?
[09:17] ErikCorry: Yeah, that would be nice, wouldn't it?
[09:18] felixge: ErikCorry: very much :)
[09:18] felixge: ErikCorry: probably not an easy task so : )
[09:18] ErikCorry: Also a bigger max heap would be convenient.
[09:18] ErikCorry: Let's see how it goesn.
[09:18] ErikCorry: goes.
[09:19] felixge: ErikCorry: one thing I really want to research is the possibility of having light-weight processes in node (something that can spawn and destroy in < 1 ms)
[09:20] felixge: ErikCorry: But most stuff I looked at so far is too slow. I guess the best way to go will be namespace "file names" + using ryan's eventsource branch
[09:20] felixge: *namespaced
[09:20] ErikCorry: Startup time for V8 is about 3ms at the moment.
[09:20] ErikCorry: Which is actually a regression.  Used to be 2ms :-(
[09:21] felixge: well, it's still impressive
[09:21] felixge: what I'm aiming for is a way to respond to each request of a http server in isolation without decreasing req/sek by more than 10%
[09:22] felixge: I think it will be very hard
[09:22] ErikCorry: Crankshaft regressed it.  Must look into that.
[09:23] ErikCorry: felixge: How isolated does it have to be.  In the browser we use contexts (when we don't use separate processes).
[09:23] felixge: ErikCorry: If an exception is not caught, I want to be able to tell which "process" it came from
[09:24] felixge: ErikCorry: I don't care too much about strict sandboxing
[09:24] felixge: ErikCorry: my main problem right now is that node drops the stack whenever it goes into the event loop
[09:24] ErikCorry: Doesn't sound like it need to be very isolated.
[09:24] felixge: so exceptions inside a node callback are usually meaningless
[09:25] felixge: no it doesn't, it just needs to be "traceable" :)
[09:25] ErikCorry: You need to put a 'process' tracking ID on each callback.
[09:25] ErikCorry: When you invoke the callback you set a global to the id.
[09:25] ErikCorry: When a new callback is scheduled you attach the current global id to the callback request.
[09:26] aklt has joined the channel
[09:26] ErikCorry: Ryan has an idea he wants to record the stack trace when the callback is set up.
[09:26] ErikCorry: Which is sort of orthogonal to what you are proposing.
[09:26] felixge: yeah
[09:26] ErikCorry: Both could give interesting information.
[09:27] felixge: well, what I'm trying to do might have less of a performance impact
[09:27] ErikCorry: That is probably true.
[09:27] felixge: anyway, that's a good idea. But it will require tons of hacking in the node core, or a whole (annoying) abstraction layer in user land
[09:28] felixge: not sure how ryan would feel about a patch for it, but I should bring it up
[09:28] ErikCorry: Sounds like something for the core to me.
[09:28] felixge: because right now you kind of have to kill your entire server after an uncaught exception, taking all current connections down with you
[09:28] ErikCorry: That sucks.
[09:28] jimt has joined the channel
[09:29] felixge: yeah ... especially when you are running an uploading service where uploads can take 8 hours ++ :)
[09:29] ErikCorry: :-(
[09:29] femtoo has joined the channel
[09:29] felixge: ErikCorry: well, in our case we could actually put each upload into it's own process
[09:30] felixge: that's literally no overhead for us compared to the encoding and other things we do with the uploads
[09:30] felixge: but I'm interested in a better solution for future generations :)
[09:30] felixge: or scenarios where that overhead would not be acceptable
[09:30] ErikCorry: I think contexts are the thing.
[09:31] ErikCorry: The word context is unfortunately used for 4 or 5 different things in the V8 code base.
[09:31] ErikCorry: The meaning depends on the context...
[09:31] felixge: : )
[09:31] ErikCorry: Contexts correspond to iframes or tabs in the browser.
[09:32] ErikCorry: (If Chrome has lots of memory it puts each tab in a different process but it doesn't have to do that.  On a small machine the tabs share processes)
[09:32] ErikCorry: (Or if you open one trillion tabs)
[09:33] chapel: I was wondering why it did that
[09:33] chapel: so thats why sometimes if one tab dies, it will take a few more
[09:33] chapel: cause they are joined
[09:33] felixge: ErikCorry: how long does it take to setup a context?
[09:33] ErikCorry: The other reason why they can be joined is if you opened one tab from another tab using a JS script.
[09:34] ErikCorry: Then they have to be joined because they can see each others' JS objects.
[09:34] ErikCorry: Eg if you open Google Calendar from Gmail that always happens.

[09:35] ErikCorry: You get a new copy of all the intrinsics like Array etc.
[09:36] ErikCorry: The repl loop used to use a new context for each line in node.js
[09:36] felixge: ErikCorry: that's pretty good
[09:36] ErikCorry: Not sure if it still doesn.
[09:37] felixge: I'll have to play with contexts I guess : )

[09:38] ErikCorry: Most household DSL lines aren't stable enough for an 8 hour upload.
[09:39] felixge: ErikCorry: we can restart uploads, yes. But we can't resume yet

[09:39] ErikCorry: Yeah, that's what I meant!
[09:39] jimt has joined the channel
[09:39] felixge: ErikCorry: But I'm looking into the HTML5 File API stuff to build something on top

[11:06] kriskowal: but i just made a thing that'll let you manipulate remote objects over socket.io with an async api, it's q-comm in npm
[11:07] shaver: websockets should be binary-safe, no?

[15:01] craigbarnes: GitHub will even host your website for free now
[15:01] jdub: fumanchu182: that just times out the connection (and is less explicit than client.request.connection.end())
[15:02] jdub: fumanchu182: both of which result in the client trying a fallback
[15:02] craigbarnes: it's typical developer syndrome - all code, no docs and no design
[15:02] jdub: there doesn't appear to be a way to disconnect with an explicit failure
[15:02] fumanchu182: I see i thought it disconnected it for good.  Hmm pass a message back to the client through send such as "disconnect" and have the browser disconnect.
[15:02] jdub: fumanchu182: that's the workaround i'm using atm
[15:03] fumanchu182: give me a second to go digging in the socket.io module and see if i can find anything
[15:04] jdub: i have done so

[16:38] pgte: amirpc: you should not throw on line 9
[16:38] pgte: you shoud call callback with the error
[16:38] amirpc: it's unit testing code
[16:38] rwaldron has joined the channel
[16:38] chapel: well the issue is the call back
[16:38] pgte: amirpc: and call callback after line 14
[16:38] amirpc: the callback continues setting up the unit test environment
[16:38] sprout has joined the channel
[16:38] chapel: the for loop dies because the call back is called immediately
[16:39] amirpc: if I call the callback inside the loop, won't it be called 3 times?
[16:39] pgte: amirpc: not on line 19, which is executed immediately
[16:39] chapel: yep
[16:39] chapel: amirpc
[16:39] montylounge has joined the channel
[16:39] pgte: amirpc: you probably have to count
[16:39] kris__ has joined the channel
[16:39] amirpc: okay so that's what I've done in the past
[16:39] chapel: you can do an if (i <= 2) callback();
[16:39] amirpc: yeah just if i == 2, yeah
[16:40] amirpc: okay I thought there might be like some sort of scope-oriented way
[16:40] chapel: well
[16:40] chapel: why do you go through it 3 times?
[16:41] amirpc: it's just a setup to a unit test, I'm putting 3 accounts into my db so I can test some accounting code
[16:41] chapel: no way to do multiple at once?
[16:41] chapel: not familiar with mongo or node+mongo
[16:41] amirpc: definitely a way I can pass an array of queries to a mongodb insert
[16:42] amirpc: this probably wasn't a good choice of code to ask on because it's pretty bad, I just finally got curious enough to ask about the design pattern. I was hoping there was some way to basically "close" a function, like in my head I imagined a 'finally' block with a call to the callback
[16:43] chapel: yeah, your issue is the call back on 19
[16:43] pgte: amirpc: I think the right way to do this is a) to stop if there is an error b( only callback when all 3 insertOnes have returned
[16:43] pgte: so you must keep count of the returned insertOnes
[16:43] chapel: yeah
[16:44] amirpc: cool, okay that's what I have been doing. But yeah you guys are def right that code is not structured well and doesn't even need to have a loop, and it's error model is dubious. 
[16:44] kuya: tjholowaychuk: hi - i looked at tobi. is there any reason why its so node orientated? couldnt it just be pointed at *any* server address? am i missing something or am i just missing writing the code? :)
[16:45] tjholowaychuk: kuya: not really a specific reason, we could do automatic closing of the server after the requests are done etc
[16:45] tjholowaychuk: but I ended up not doing that anyway

[16:50] chapel: heh, pgte I was thinking about that
[16:50] pgte: chapel :)
[16:50] amirpc: pgte: Awesome :) Yeah I am restructuring it to use a single insert statement, but the example is much appreciated.

[17:46] jtrally: I have preferred Mongo over Couch but its very app dependent
[17:46] EyePulp: I've been using mongo pretty happily with the node-native driver and mongoose on top for some cleanliness
[17:46] Chadams: looking at it now, seems like it's REST based like couch is. thats cool
[17:46] squeek: node.js/PL anyone?
[17:46] EyePulp: Chadams: may be determined a bit by what you want to do with the db
[17:47] jtrally: Mongo is not REST based.  it's drivers are native
[17:47] jtrally: but interacting with it in the shell is javascript based
[17:48] Chadams: actually your right, I see that now

[17:52] Gruni has joined the channel
[17:52] bingomanatee_: And you are essentially working in JSON. 
[17:53] jtrally: BSON :)
[17:53] bingomanatee_: Couch's main advantage is its intrinsic transactions which give you automatic archiving and  insulation against race conditions.
[17:53] Yuffster_work has joined the channel
[17:54] bingomanatee_: Yes - but to a noSQL shopper BSON == JSON.

[17:56] Chadams: well I work with JSON a lot so I would prefer to keep with that
[17:56] bingomanatee_: Craigslist is using Mongo as well. They presented at MongoSV

[17:56] Chadams: JSON & JavaScript
[17:56] shaver: it's also is-it-mature-used-the-way-you-use-it
[17:57] bingomanatee_: Maturity isn't about usefulness. Its about how easy it is to sell a particular platform in house. 
[17:57] qnt4b: I thought maturity was about knowledge, experience, and the wisdom to identify the right solution for the right problem, but bingo's probably right: it's all about marketing ;)
[17:58] bingomanatee_: Nobody in my circle even wants to look at Node because they are mature successful professionals who've made (in one case) Billions of dollars selling mature software to companies like Live Nation, Cisco Systems and other large vendors.

[17:59] aguynamedben has joined the channel
[17:59] tjholowaychuk: bingomanatee_ haha, its like seo, selling nothing for hundreds of thousands
[17:59] bingomanatee_: So as much as I hate to say it, until someone makes billions of dollars with Node and Mongo, or a billion dollar company publically usees either product, they don't exist to major decision makers. 
[18:00] bingomanatee_: pretty much. 
[18:00] bingomanatee_: Just because a product is Open Source doesn't mean it is invulnerable to marketplace realities. 
[18:00] tfe has joined the channel
[18:01] jtrally: Maturity can be about usefulness.  Oracle is a mature product for a transactional DB but they sell it as the almighty hammer for every persistence problem when there are use cases in which it certainly doesn't shine.
[18:01] dguttman has joined the channel
[18:01] bingomanatee_: Maturity is about stability and a proven legacy of use under real world conditions. 
[18:01] bingomanatee_: It has nothing to do with usefulness. Do you really think CTOs give a shit about how much fun a given platform is to code in?
[18:01] jtrally: for a given use case, but not for all use cases
[18:02] qnt4b: the good thing is node is hitched to the cloud, and these days "cloud" == money and (slowly) growing awareness within the enterprise
[18:02] bingomanatee_: Do you think that anyone gave a shit about how "Useful" windows was when they forced it on the masses? Everyone knew Macs were more "Useful". What they didn't know was whether the Mac was going to make them money or be cost effective.
[18:04] jtrally: Which is what I'm getting at...  not how easy it is to code in
[18:04] bingomanatee_: Fair enough

[18:25] pyrotechnick: tjholowaychuk: that's another effect of SS physics

[18:25] tjholowaychuk: bingomanatee_: you cant trust the client
[18:25] pyrotechnick: bingomanatee: yes, but u need anti-cheat
[18:25] tjholowaychuk: for anything
[18:25] pyrotechnick: which involves doing it all on the server

[19:47] bingomanatee_: KrisJordan - there are three obvious load balancing models. 
[19:47] bingomanatee_: One is to use websockets both on the client and the server to distribute work between clients (webworkers even) and servers. 
[19:48] bingomanatee_: The other is to use a node based message queue and allow node clients to work off of it. 
[19:48] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[19:49] bingomanatee_: The third and this is not node but - MongoDB allows you to distribute data between servers and balances the load with replication and sharding, and you can communicate to MongoDB with node. 
[19:49] deepthawtz has joined the channel
[19:49] bingomanatee_: Other noSQL solutions may do this as well - I can only speak to MongoDB with authority.

[20:01] wink_: i rewrote a mongo binding because the native mongo driver was horribly slow
[20:01] aurynn: wink_, what sort of performance would you expect?
[20:01] wink_: aurynn: from a js implementation, it's exactly what i'd expect
[20:01] bingomanatee_: wink_: very interested.
[20:01] aurynn: wink_, I'm able to push ~3000 q/s against postgres on a laptop, and I find that pretty reasonable
[20:01] bingomanatee_: Which repo?
[20:02] maritz: redis isn't that difficult either.
[20:02] wink_: aurynn: how much data are you actually moving around? not just queries per sec
[20:02] wink_: because a few mb result set from those queries is gonna kill that
[20:02] wink_: i mean "select 1 from table", sure
[20:02] aurynn: wink_, those were pretty simple tests, and it requires a pooling system no matter what.
[20:03] bingomanatee_: Redis is supposedly the fastest repository out there. Mongo, and other NoSQL solutions are probably comparable, but the nature of Redis means that I very much doubt anyone will ever make a faster system. 
[20:03] wink_: not connection pooling
[20:03] aurynn: Since a couple meg will collapse everything anyway

[20:07] aurynn: wink_, Something C-based for the major work of doing packet decode

[20:09] springif` has joined the channel
[20:09] aurynn: and test grabbing small subsets of data from PG, as opposed to an entire multi-MB resultset.
[20:09] wink_: mongo's protocol definitely sucks for large result sets
[20:09] aurynn: (which you can do cleanly and easily on the protocol level)
[20:09] muk_mb: oh there we go, I figured it out
[20:10] wink_: they really fucked the pooch by limiting things to 4mb before you have to ask for me
[20:10] mikeal: i don't see these use cases very often
[20:10] wink_: er, more
[20:10] mikeal: it's called paging
[20:10] ryah: how do i get unix time in js?
[20:10] wink_: Mike_L: sure and it's a waste when i dont need it
[20:10] wink_: erm
[20:11] wink_: if i know i need all 100mb of data, its just extra hoops to jump through to get it
[20:11] mgutz: Is Redis/Mongo suitable for a small 512M RAM VPS?
[20:11] mikeal: .getTime()
[20:11] mikeal: ryah: ^^
[20:11] wink_: mgutz: yeah
[20:11] mikeal: new Date().getTime()
[20:11] ryah: thx
[20:12] mikeal: mgutz: Redis has a VM mode that will only keep the keys in memory and the values on disc
[20:12] bingomanatee_: mguz: can you provide more detail on your use case?
[20:12] piscisaureus: ryah: is not unix time. it is unix time * 1000
[20:12] mikeal: that should be enough, depending on your use case

[20:12] tjholowaychuk: ryah: Date.now() as well

[20:15] bingomanatee_: Keep in mind- while Redis and MongoDB both run in memory they do have disk storages that they use in tandem with their memory cache. 
[20:16] mikeal: you can use commonjs modules
[20:16] mikeal: but not any node module
[20:16] guybrush: mhh i guess i dont get the whole thing
[20:16] mikeal: MongoDB's *will* corrupt
[20:16] mikeal: Redis won't

[20:17] mikeal: half the MySQL backends are durable
[20:17] bingomanatee_: Mongo presumes replication on production level systems. 
[20:17] mikeal: haha
[20:17] mikeal: yeah, that's their crazy marketing
[20:17] mikeal: that running 3 servers is the only solution for durability
[20:17] bingomanatee_: There is a small chance that a single server will fail - its pretty impossible for multiple servers to fail at the same time. 
[20:18] wink_: couch won't until they find another bug eating people's data :>
[20:18] bingomanatee_: I've caused MySQL to fail and get corrupt. 
[20:18] wink_: sorry low blow ;>
[20:18] mikeal: technically, it didn't "lose" the data, it wrote it, it just didn't write the header, the fix for that bug recovered the data
[20:18] bingomanatee_: I'm just saying - nobody who cares about data integrity in ANY system allows for a single point of failure. 
[20:18] mikeal: ok, here's how it works
[20:18] mraleph1 has joined the channel
[20:18] mikeal: if you use an append-only log
[20:19] mikeal: you can't get caught mid-write cycle and corrupt the entire database
[20:19] mikeal: or a section of the btree
[20:19] mikeal: only the last write operation
[20:19] bingomanatee_: A single physical server is a single point of failure. 
[20:19] mikeal: that's why Postgres, CouchDB, some MySQL backends, and Redis use append-only
[20:19] blowery: what happens if i break into the server room with a squirt gun?
[20:19] mikeal: MongoDB is just a mem-mapped file that occationally writes to disc
[20:19] bingomanatee_: People managing real data worth real money always distribute transactions on redundant systems. Its not a marketing ploy by MongoDB - its just good practice. 
[20:19] mikeal: yeah, that' why you rsync the log :)
[20:19] wink_: well come on now mikeal, it can absolutely fsync per write
[20:20] mikeal: "slave" replication in CouchDB is literally a file copy
[20:20] mikeal: you can do it at any time
[20:20] bingomanatee_: Doesn't Redis have a physical storage system and therefore also write to log? I am not a Redis expert but are the systems truly that different?
[20:20] mikeal: you can do multi-server replication with other databases, MongoDB didn't fuckign invent it
[20:20] blowery: bingomanatee: having seen a lot of businesses in action, i wouldn't say always :D
[20:20] mikeal: Redis writes to an append-only log, yes
[20:20] technoweenie: what about people in real america managing real data for real mom and pop sites
[20:20] mikeal: technoweenie: exactly
[20:20] blowery: technoweenie: real americans don't need computers
[20:21] mikeal: normal people don't run 3 production servers with failover
[20:21] mikeal: hell, MongoHQ doesn't do it!
[20:21] bingomanatee_: so - and I'm not trying to win an argument , I really wan tto know - what is the differences between Redis' approach to memory/physical storage and mongo's?
[20:21] mikeal: it's very very different
[20:21] dgathright has joined the channel
[20:21] technoweenie: redis has 2 approaches:  bgsave (fork and flush to disk) and append log
[20:21] mikeal: so, MongoDB doens't keep all data in memory always
[20:21] mikeal: they just takes writes in to memory and do some caching
[20:21] jimt has joined the channel
[20:22] mikeal: redis is ALL in memory with an append-only log for persistence between reboots
[20:22] nejucomo has joined the channel
[20:22] mikeal: MongoDB is not append-only, it writes in place and if it fails mid-write that section of the db is just corrupt
[20:22] bingomanatee_: Thats a fair point. 
[20:22] bingomanatee_: CouchDB uses a similar append only strategy doesn't it?
[20:23] mikeal: CouchDB is all append-only on-disc with no in memory cache
[20:23] bingomanatee_: interesting
[20:23] mikeal: it lets the kernel handle any fs caching
[20:23] mikeal: some caching is coming in the next release
[20:23] mikeal: i think 1.1 has a small cache for the inner-btree node offests
[20:23] Ezku\: mikeal: redis is getting a new engine that reverses the situation with memory and persistence
[20:24] SubStack: ACTION needs to port the browserling backend dbs to couchdb here eventually
[20:24] mikeal: i'm skeptical about a lot of the Redis roadmap
[20:24] bingomanatee_: So - and I'm thinking of the "clumsy janitor" scenario - if someone unplugs the server which model is more likely to lose more data - mongo or Redis?
[20:24] mikeal: it's starting to drift away from their use case
[20:24] bingomanatee_: I realise this is edge case but still.
[20:24] bsdguru has joined the channel
[20:24] mikeal: Mongo *will*
[20:24] mikeal: if it's writing to disc, it will corrupt
[20:24] bmizerany has joined the channel
[20:24] SubStack: fortunately the 'models' are just dnode services so it should be super simple once I wrap my head around couch
[20:25] mikeal: with Redis, you might lose the last write that is being fsync'd
[20:25] djanowski: any zombie.js contributors?
[20:25] mikeal: but it'll come right back up
[20:25] mikeal: couchdb stores JSON
[20:25] bingomanatee_: That is good to know. 
[20:25] mikeal: by key, with a revision
[20:25] mikeal: it's uber simple
[20:25] mikeal: views get a little tricky cause you have to learn some map/reduce
[20:26] genbit has joined the channel
[20:26] mikeal: but the datastore part couldn't be simpler
[20:26] SubStack: key/value is pretty damn nice
[20:26] bingomanatee_: Can you index by field in CouchDB?
[20:26] gnrfan has joined the channel
[20:26] bingomanatee_: or redis?
[20:26] mikeal: you just write a map/reduce that indexed that filed
[20:26] charlenopires has joined the channel
[20:26] mikeal: map/reduce in CouchDB actually writes the index to disc and updates it on read
[20:26] mikeal: so it's not run across the whole datastore on every read like Riak and Mongo
[20:27] bingomanatee_: Thanks a lot. 
[20:27] technoweenie: different use cases
[20:27] rburhum has joined the channel
[20:27] technoweenie: though i wish riak had couchdb style map/reduce too
[20:27] mikeal: Redis has datastructures that will help you do that kind of indexing, but if you're thinking about key indexing you're probably not thing in redis
[20:27] bingomanatee_: I'm just getting into NoSQL so this kind of information is really useful to me.
[20:27] mikeal: s/thing/thinking
[20:27] mikeal: technoweenie: everyone does
[20:27] Me1000 has joined the channel
[20:27] mikeal: but, they just shipped full text indexing
[20:27] mikeal: that is really nice
[20:28] skampler: riak has full text indexing?
[20:28] mikeal: and solves a lot of the complaints people had with only having map/reduce
[20:28] mikeal: yup
[20:28] mikeal: latest version
[20:28] technoweenie: theres a separate riak search product that includes the riak k/v shit
[20:28] tapwater has joined the channel
[20:28] technoweenie: so if you just upgrade riak k/v you wont see it
[20:28] mikeal: oh i see
[20:28] isaacs has joined the channel
[20:30] dtrasbo has joined the channel
[20:30] mikeal: CouchDB has a lucene plugin for full text

[20:33] jtrally: so does Mongo
[20:34] aconbere has joined the channel
[20:34] mikeal: no, it doesn't
[20:34] mikeal: it's a geohash
[20:34] mikeal: you can't do much with it
[20:34] mikeal: GeoCouch is a full rtree
[20:34] bingomanatee_: Sure you can. The citizens of my flat world adore it and store all their location data with Mongo. 
[20:34] bingomanatee_: It helps keep them off the edges 
[20:34] jtrally: hah
[20:35] mikeal: all you can store is point data
[20:35] mikeal: and do box queries
[20:35] mikeal: you can't store geometries
[20:35] bingomanatee_: or radial queries. 
[20:35] mikeal: you can't search based on geometries
[20:35] bingomanatee_: Of course its a "radial" query
[20:35] dmcquay has joined the channel
[20:35] jtrally: yeah the new version will support that.  
[20:35] mikeal: you should look at some of the stuff max ogden has done with geocouch

[20:36] mikeal: this is geocouch
[20:36] mikeal: http://www.pdxapi.com/preview.html
[20:36] bingomanatee_: I think if Geo was my space I'd just use a guy like that. 
[20:36] saikat has joined the channel
[20:36] mikeal: the really cool stuff is working with line data
[20:36] bingomanatee_: He stores polys and everything. 
[20:37] mikeal: honestly, if you're serious about geo
[20:37] bingomanatee_: that is pretty sweet. 
[20:37] mikeal: you either use PostGIS or something proprietary
[20:38] jchris has joined the channel
[20:38] mikeal: GeoCouch is awesome but it's still playing cachtup to PostGIS in terms of featureset

[20:39] mikeal: looking at the food cart data makes me jelous
[20:39] hunterloftis: File uploads: all into one /uploads folder or break into /uploads/userhash - thoughts, comments?
[20:40] SubStack: hunterloftis: are filenames randomized when you store them?
[20:40] hunterloftis: SubStack: yeah all files are a uuid, so we're not worried about collisions
[20:41] SubStack: I guess it depends on if you already have nice metadata for the files then
[20:41] hunterloftis: SubStack: Yeah the metadata isn't an issue, we can get all the information from our db
[20:41] bingomanatee_: mikeal - what is the node API for couch like?
[20:42] SubStack: well I vote usrhash anyway
[20:43] SubStack: only because I don't like looking at too many files in the same directory
[20:43] hunterloftis: SubStack: Yeah that's one of our considerations... but how often will we be looking at them? And it will be marginally easier to code without usrhashes
[20:45] bingomanatee_: <--- looking forward to PORTLANDIA on IFC with Fred Armisen - "Its where young people go to retire!"

[21:11] vineyard has joined the channel
[21:11] isaacs: Aikar: drop the npm-completion.sh into /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d if you have it, or just source it in your .bashrc or whatever.
[21:12] isaacs: possibilities: if you're having trouble ssh-ing in, contact support.

[21:12] possibilities: i can ssh into the node account, but not admin
[21:12] possibilities: w/ key
[21:12] isaacs: piscisaureus, ryah: I +1 that 
[21:12] isaacs: possibilities: you don't get admin rights on them.
[21:12] isaacs: possibilities: just node@whatever.no.de
[21:13] possibilities: ah, cool, ok, the docs refer to changing admin and root passwords
[21:13] isaacs: possibilities: those are docs for "regular" smartos smartmachines
[21:13] possibilities: ah, got it, thank you
[21:13] isaacs: possibilities: the no.de machines are more like an appliance.  the node@ user can do anything you need to do.  which should basically just be starting a node program.
[21:14] isaacs: possibilities: if you git push as that node user to node@hostname.no.de:repo, then it'll rebuild and restart the service.

[21:20] isaacs: pekim: i could just have it be yet another *root configuration param, but i don't know... seems hacky
[21:21] isaacs: and i'm never sure if it should be /etc/bash_completion.d or /opt/local/etc/bash_completion.d or /usr/local/etc/... etc
[21:21] pekim: isaacs: Could 'nave use' do the sourcing if it finds npm installed? That doesn't help the pure npm case though.
[21:21] ryah: 1 ~/projects/node (master) # find /home/ryan/local/node/lib/node/npm | grep bash
[21:21] isaacs: yeah, nave could be smart about that, i guess

[21:22] ryah: 1 ~/projects/node (master) # 
[21:22] isaacs: ryah: oh, it's not in there.
[21:22] isaacs: it's in lib/node/.npm/npm/<version>/package
[21:22] isaacs: lib/node/npm is just the folder with the node modules.
[21:22] ryah: suck that i have to source a particular version
[21:23] isaacs: ryah: yeah, agreed.
[21:23] isaacs: i don't have a good solution for that.  i just drop the file directly into my bash_completion.d
[21:23] isaacs: ryah: i guess i could list it as a bin or something

[21:41] mgutz: most MS developers can't do anything outside of Visual Studio

[21:44] pekim: isaacs: I found "10 Cool Things You Probably Didn’t Realize npm Could Do" when I was searching for info about npm tab completion earlier. Just read it (all 13 cool things). Great post. I wish I'd come across it a little sooner.
[21:44] isaacs: pekim: thanks
[21:44] isaacs: pekim: i need a tech writer
[21:45] isaacs: or maybe just compile the npm documentation into a book or something
[21:45] hornairs has joined the channel
[21:45] isaacs: maybe for 1.0.0
[21:47] SubStack: minions
[21:47] pekim: isaacs: All the info seems to be there in the docs, it's just that when you start out with npm you don't realise all of what's there. It's the classic, you don't know what you don't know. 
[21:47] isaacs: right
[21:47] isaacs: There's a special place in teh contributors list and changelog for anyone who wants to renovate the docs

[22:01] mgutz: without exec
[22:03] sechrist: unless there's some other way that I'm not aware of, you might just have to bind it in little C lib
[22:03] sechrist: node has a ton of file system methods though -- I find it a little odd that touch isn't there already

[22:13] jbpros has joined the channel
[22:14] AAA_awright: fumanchu182: I guess it would be equivalant to dynamic binding, but that's not really what it is, ECMAScript falls back onto calling another method if the given one doesn't have it defined, or something like that
[22:14] AAA_awright: Get cozy with the ECMA spec and read up on prototypes
[22:15] adambeynon has joined the channel
[22:15] fumanchu182: Yeah I learned the difference from dynamic scoping vs lexical scoping thanks to node.js

[22:15] fumanchu182: I am just psyched about this whole thing, it makes working with the web fun again.
[22:16] sechrist: I mean part of javascript's power is that it's implemented everywhere
[22:16] sechrist: adding stuff onto the spec kind of ruins it
[22:16] sechrist: because it'll never work in browsers that people have to support

[22:34] bingomanatee_: question - I am trying to create a delayed action for a repo that takes a while to connect https://gist.github.com/770234
[22:35] bingomanatee_: will the function in the getInterval associate itself with the record being inserted via closures, or will this fail?

[22:38] common: how to create arrays like struct foo { char bar[8]; }; with node-ffi?
[22:39] common: while I can create a struct
[22:39] common: I have not figured out yet how to create an array of a given type
[22:40] Kingdutch: common, you tried char[8] bar?
[22:40] sveimac has joined the channel
[22:40] Kingdutch: As in the type is a character array of 8 chars (char[8]) named bar
[22:41] common: actually not
[22:41] common: let me check
[22:42] common: does not work
[22:42] common: size gets NaN
[22:42] Kingdutch: Do you even need to specify a js type?
[22:42] Kingdutch: I thought it was just
[22:42] Kingdutch: var bar;
[22:42] Kingdutch: bar[0] = 1
[22:42] Kingdutch: bar[5] = 2
[22:43] Kingdutch: size = 2 (key 0 and 5 are set)
[22:43] Kingdutch: or something like that
[22:43] common: http://p.carnivore.it/TOooeg
[22:43] common: node-ffi
[22:43] common: like ctypes for python
[22:44] common: only difference so far, pythons ctypes can do arrays
[22:44] Kingdutch: Never did python, I grew up with perl lol
[22:44] zorzar_ has joined the channel
[22:44] Kingdutch: Normal (As in browser) JS is just var bar = new Array();
[22:44] Kingdutch: But yeh, there, Array is a class/object
[22:44] common: ffi is a wrapper
[22:44] common: you define the structures and prototypes for functions
[22:44] common: and call native api
[22:45] Kingdutch: right yeh, just getting into node, haven't looked at ffi yet
[22:45] bingomanatee_: Kingdutch - regardless of whether you HAVE to I would suggest that var bar = {} or var bar = [] is a little better self-documenation
[22:45] ckundo has joined the channel
[22:46] Kingdutch: bingomanatee_: I agree, but it was just as example
[22:46] bingomanatee_: you are familiar with REPL no?
[22:46] bingomanatee_: You can test these things by calling node at console without a file to process
[22:46] Kingdutch: No
[22:46] bingomanatee_: > node
[22:46] bingomanatee_: and real time interact with JS till you're drained.
[22:46] Kingdutch: Anyway common: In the examples I see arrays of values being passed in: [ "Value1" , "value2" ] 
[22:47] svens_ has joined the channel
[22:47] Kingdutch: So I'm gonna put my finger on var arr = [ "Val1", "val2" ];
[22:47] Kingdutch: If your debugger says that's size NaN then your debugger doesn't like arrays? :X
[22:47] stagas has joined the channel
[22:47] bingomanatee_: BTW it failed that test - if you don't assign a variable a value its undefined even if you "var" it.
[22:49] Kingdutch: anyway, nearing midnight, and I've got to get up at 7 AM (On a saturday -.-') So I'll auto-join tommorow :)
[22:49] Kingdutch: Good night
[22:49] common: Kingdutch look at the example code I pasted, and figure out you are completely wrong with all your assumptions yet
[22:49] Kingdutch: common: Yeh, that example code doesn't make an ounce of sense to me, so so far for my JS knowledge I guess

[23:04] bingomanatee_: so questiopn on setInterval
[23:04] bingomanatee_: If you setInterval(function(){console.log(foo); }, 500) 
[23:04] bingomanatee_: will it remember the "foo" from your local context through closure
[23:04] bingomanatee_: or will it look for foo only in the global context?
[23:04] kriskowal: yes
[23:04] EyePulp: anyone have a favorite method for node deployment?  Our project includes a mixture of github & bitbucket repos in it.
[23:05] kriskowal: bingomanatee_ it will look up foo in your scope chain every iteration.
[23:05] bingomanatee_: so if you setInterval in the context of a function it will remember all the locals from that function even after the function call is done?
[23:06] bingomanatee_: EyePulp: npm is pretty much the gold standard for node deployment isn't it? Normal people like me prob. use git tho :D
[23:07] dgathright has joined the channel
[23:07] jameshome has left the channel
[23:08] EyePulp: bingomanatee: I thought npm was purely a centralized package manager for node modules.  I can use it for some things, but I guess I'm thinking about broader issues, e.g. a scripted deployment solution to tie in everything, not just pulling individual modules.
[23:09] airhorns has joined the channel
[23:09] bingomanatee_: I'm not that qualified to answer TBH but I believe npm has a lot of hooks for scripts et all.

[23:38] kriskowal: gotta do graceful reconnection. won't be too hard.

[23:39] liar has joined the channel
[23:39] cainus: it's http 1.1 or websockets from my browser?
[23:39] kriskowal: depends on your browser. socket.io does the work.
[23:39] cainus: ah neeto
[23:39] kriskowal: if you've got a websocket, it uses it
[23:40] kriskowal: then it falls back to xhr transfer-encoding chunked mime/multipart in an iframe hackery
[23:40] cainus: impressive
[23:40] kriskowal: that should probably all be hyphenated
[23:41] cainus: anyone capable of giving some RESTful design advice?  I've got jpeg resource that I want to have some meta-data with it... should I do that as two content-types of one resource, or two resources?
[23:41] bartt has joined the channel
[23:42] echosystm: you could send the meta-data back as headers
[23:42] echosystm: x-yourmetadatanamehere
[23:42] echosystm: or cookies
[23:42] cainus: naw I want to be able to just get it instead of aalways needing to get a big binary
[23:42] echosystm: ok, put it in the query then
[23:43] cainus: I'm talking about responses, not requests
[23:43] cainus: for retrieving the meta data
[23:43] echosystm: .com/images/x.jpg?meta
[23:43] tg has joined the channel
[23:43] cainus: meta-data is autogenerated
[23:45] echosystm: you've lost me
[23:46] echosystm: are you saying you want to use the accept header to determine whether to send metadata or binary?
[23:46] stepheneb has joined the channel
[23:46] cainus: yeah...  jpeg or the json meta-data 
[23:46] cainus: VS. two different resources
[23:47] pekim: kriskowal: re Starwars - Sometimes it's hitting "Uncaught RangeError: Invalid array length" in terminal.js at line 23.
[23:47] echosystm: i wouldnt do two different resources, it unnecessarily complicates your uri scheme
[23:47] kriskowal: is that what it is? that's cool.
[23:48] pekim: I just happened to look in Chrome's console.
[23:48] cainus: echosystm: client needs to really watch accept headers that way though
[23:48] echosystm: i guess using the accept header is ok, but i would prefer to use a query
[23:48] kriskowal: oh, weird. that's in the window size metrics code. not the first place i'd look for athat.
[23:49] cainus: hmm I think accept header would be the restful way
[23:50] echosystm: true
[23:51] echosystm: it is the more... correct method
[23:51] djanowski_away: cainus, echosystm: not following the convo but http://www.gethifi.com/blog/browser-rest-http-accept-headers
