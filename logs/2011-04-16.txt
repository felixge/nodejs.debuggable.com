[00:00] aaronblohowiak: techwraith: nonce
[00:00] techwraith: How do people ususally handle authentication over socket.io?
[00:01] techwraith: (or even sessions?)
[00:01] techwraith: Haven't played around with it enough to know...
[00:01] aaronblohowiak: techwraith: i have used a nonce
[00:02] kriszyp has joined the channel
[00:02] therrg has joined the channel
[00:02] techwraith: hmmm, interesting
[00:03] techwraith: Probably a lot less complicated than it looks
[00:03] ruben1194navarro has joined the channel
[00:06] aaronblohowiak: techwraith: yes.  if you have a session id, you just generate a nonce that you expose into the html that you have the client echo back, and then you can associate that socket.io client with the HTTP session
[00:06] prettyrobots: Anyone know of an async JSON module?
[00:06] techwraith: prettyrobots: What do you mean?

[00:09] Levi has joined the channel

[00:10] prettyrobots: ?
[00:10] danheberden has joined the channel
[00:11] prettyrobots: I mean outside of the construction pattern?
[00:11] jonaslund: oh.. you mean you want some kind of callback based building thing ?
[00:12] prettyrobots: Yes.
[00:12] ckknight_: ooh, lemme try
[00:12] ckknight_: wait, my idea wouldn't be async
[00:12] ckknight_: just lazy.
[00:12] prettyrobots: I imagine that functions would be callbacks.
[00:13] prettyrobots: ckknight_: Hey! I wanna write it if it don't exist!
[00:13] ckknight_: pshaw
[00:13] prettyrobots: ckknight_: pshaw?
[00:14] ckknight_: onomatopoeia

[00:25] brolin has joined the channel
[00:25] techwraith: Not sure if it's the best, but parseInt(buffer.toString()) might do it
[00:26] techwraith: seems a bit silly though
[00:26] ckknight_: wink_: are you treating it as a raw Int32 or is it a string that contains the textual representation of a number?
[00:26] ckknight_: prettyrobots: okay, I have a lazy but non-async version: http://pastebin.com/h4BTGugN
[00:26] ckknight_: prettyrobots: lemme work on the async version
[00:28] techwraith: That's a good point ckknight_
[00:28] ckknight_: wink_: if you are treating it as a raw Int32, is it little-endian or big-endian?

[00:36] wink__: ckknight: sorry about that, i'd like it to be an int keeping the byte order in the buffer
[00:36] shaunau: Using express is there any problem with return next() rather than next() for middleware routing?
[00:36] tjholowaychuk: shaunau: it does not return a value so no that is fine
[00:36] tjholowaychuk: doesnt matter
[00:36] gmci has joined the channel
[00:37] shaunau: tjholowaychuk: ok. thank you
[00:37] ckknight_: next(); return; and return next(); are fundamentally equivalent, since they should both return undefined, and also, nothing looks at the return value anyway.
[00:37] Guest98086 has left the channel
[00:37] shaunau: ckknight_: cool, i find it reads easier with the return
[00:38] wink__: so index 0 would be msb of the 4 byte int
[00:38] wink__: i could do it by hand, i was just wondering if there was a shortcut ala toString
[00:38] prettyrobots: value += Math.pow(256, bit_offset) * b
[00:39] prettyrobots: value += Math.pow(256, bit_offset) * bit
[00:39] prettyrobots: wink_: No shortcut last I checked.
[00:39] wink__: booo :>
[00:39] prettyrobots: Maybe something is exposed in the node.js code.
[00:39] langworthy has joined the channel
[00:39] wink__: i didnt see anything in the docs, i just wanted to make sure before i went and rolled it by hand
[00:40] prettyrobots: There is some pack and unpack stuff in buffer.
[00:40] prettyrobots: I'm not sure how far that has come along.
[00:40] prettyrobots: Buffer.
[00:40] prettyrobots: Look at the CPP code. Maybe there is something there you can use.
[00:40] wink__: hasnt made it into the docs yet :P
[00:40] prettyrobots: Or maybe it went away.
[00:40] wink__: i'll dig through it

[00:40] tprice has joined the channel
[00:40] timcosgrove has left the channel
[00:41] tprice: need some advice
[00:41] tprice: im doing something like "message = JSON.parse(message.toString());"
[00:41] tprice: now the message is a json string
[00:41] wink__: yeah, just glancing at the .h, im gonna have to do it by hand
[00:41] tprice: but message does not turn into an object
[00:42] Corren has joined the channel
[00:42] prettyrobots: wink_: I'm not seeing it.
[00:42] wink__: tprice: is message.toString() returning an actual json string?
[00:42] prettyrobots: Disappeared. Roll your own.
[00:42] wink__: on it
[00:42] prettyrobots: Actual string string.
[00:43] prettyrobots: wink_: Oh, thought you were asking about Buffer.
[00:43] wink__: i was, that last one was a response to tprice
[00:43] prettyrobots: And apologies in advance if someone else knows the secret int conversion API and you rolled your own.
[00:43] tprice: yeah message would look like "{"method":"test","params":[],"id":"amep5rqlmxw"}"
[00:43] tprice: i dont get an error on JSON.parse
[00:44] wink__: you wouldnt, what does message turn into after that call
[00:44] ckknight_: okay, prettyrobots, async version: http://pastebin.com/d6YPrhRe
[00:44] tprice: <wink__> i look the same
[00:45] tprice: looks like it does not do anything to the string
[00:45] wink__: tprice: hrm, i'd have to see your code, it sounds like you've got a scope issue maybe?
[00:45] prettyrobots: ckknight_: Looks good. You should wrap it up.
[00:46] ckknight_: yeah, I think I'll make a lib and publish it on github.
[00:46] ckknight_: with proper testing.
[00:46] prettyrobots: Call it async-json.
[00:46] prettyrobots: Sure to be a hit.
[00:46] ckknight_: works for me.
[00:46] ckknight_: oh, I hope so
[00:46] ckknight_: it's synchronous if you have no functions (as it should be), and async if and only if you have a function which takes a callback
[00:47] tprice: <wink__> i dont know about scope problem should not be a problem
[00:47] ckknight_: so one could do: uberStringify({ data: function(callback) { fetchSomethingFromMongo(function(err, data) { callback(err, data); } } }, function(err, result) { })
[00:47] tprice: this is the code http://pastebin.com/qY15TPB5
[00:48] tprice: no this http://pastebin.com/Q6RzMWUT
[00:48] ckknight_: btw, don't use the code I pasted on pastebin, wait for me to add documentation and testing. Should be no more than two hours, my guess.
[00:50] ckknight_: prettyrobots: oh, also a good idea: I could make a streaming API for it as well
[00:50] tprice: maybe it was function scope just change var message to var a and it worked
[00:51] ckknight_: for anyone who wants to follow: https://github.com/ckknight/async-json
[00:51] ckknight_: okay, gonna head home, be back in a bit.

[05:06] ckknight: because eval is the most evil thing ever and you're using it wrong regardless
[05:07] stepheneb has joined the channel
[05:07] Croms: why do people freak out when they see eval
[05:07] jeromegn has joined the channel
[05:07] ckknight: because it's generally unsafe
[05:07] path[l]: it's like goto
[05:08] ckknight: and especially for what you're trying to do, which is replace a dynamically named object, that is wrong on many levels.
[05:08] ckknight: a better thing to do would be to pass in an Object and simply replace a key
[05:08] framlin: it seem you wnt to do something like var a = {}; a["object"+name]=value
[05:08] ckknight: e.g. obj[name] = value
[05:08] Croms: ckknight: what if name went multiple levels deep?
[05:09] ckknight: name.split(".")
[05:09] ckknight: and go through that.
[05:10] ckknight: on a completely separate topic, I made an asynchronous JSON stringify library: https://github.com/ckknight/async-json
[05:12] breccan has joined the channel
[05:12] Croms: cool, i'll have a look
[05:14] path[l]: it takes on object and makes a string out of it?
[05:14] path[l]: why does it need to be async?
[05:14] ckknight: path[l]: depends on need. If you don't need async, great, use JSON.stringify
[05:14] path[l]: no I mean, isnt it all cpu no IO?
[05:14] ckknight: if you want to use an asynchronous part of your object, you can use this lib.
[05:15] ckknight: path[l]: in the Readme, I discuss an IO-driven async callback

[05:15] Croms: how would you go about cycling through name.split(".") without loosing the scope of the object though?
[05:16] Croms: probably more of a question for ##javascript
[05:16] ckknight: var innerObject = object; var parts = name.split("."); for (var i = 0; i < parts.length - 1; i++) { innerObject = innerObject[parts[i]]; }; innerObject[parts[parts.length - 1]] = value;
[05:16] indutny: ryah: ping?
[05:17] path[l]: I have a question. If Im writing a large file to a write stream. Like 30,000 rows. Is it better to write one string, or issue several writes all at once?
[05:17] Croms: ckknight: i'll give that a try, looks like we're doing the same sort of thing
[05:18] Croms: been trying for days to do a similar for loop approach but couldn't get it right
[05:19] ckknight: Croms: well, my code should work.
[05:19] ckknight: actually, simpler version:
[05:19] Croms: kept narrowing down the initial json object
[05:19] ckknight: var innerObject = object; var parts = name.split("."); var lastPart = parts.pop(); parts.forEach(function(part) { innerObject = innerObject[part]; }); innerObject[lastPart] = value;
[05:20] Croms: but still, regardless of whether or not eval is bad or not, i don't understand why that gist doesn't work
[05:20] Croms: might be a bug
[05:20] ckknight: it's not a bug.
[05:20] ckknight: eval doesn't work like that.
[05:20] ckknight: eval always returns an rvalue
[05:21] ckknight: you were trying to use it as an lvalue
[05:21] timmywil has joined the channel
[05:21] path[l]: I dont get that example anyway though. object would have been something like {foo: bar}, wouldnt "object" + name be like {foo: bar}name ?

[05:42] micheil: uhh.. JSON.parse and JSON.stringify are standard methods.
[05:42] jjmalina: oh ok
[05:42] micheil: if you have a string, then yes, of course you need to do a JSON.parse

[05:59] Croms: apparently not
[05:59] path[l]: an rvalue can be used on the right side of an =
[05:59] path[l]: an lvalue can be used on the left side

[06:00] path[l]: a constant or a literal cannot be an rvalue
[06:00] justintnt: path: try that again
[06:00] framlin: "meepmeep" = 7 makes no sense and so its not possible ....
[06:01] path[l]: sorry try what?
[06:01] abraham has joined the channel
[06:01] justintnt: a constant or literal cannot be an lvalue
[06:01] path[l]: like 7 = 3
[06:02] path[l]: or framlin's example I guess 
[06:02] Croms: var foo = eval("object" + reference); foo = value;
[06:03] path[l]: anyway lvalues almost always can be rvalues, but not vice versa. 
[06:03] Croms: isn't foo a placeholder for an lvalue?
[06:03] path[l]: yeah, but you're replacing foo
[06:03] path[l]: you've defined a variable called foo
[06:03] justintnt: croms: not after its evaluated
[06:03] path[l]: and then you replaced what it holds
[06:03] path[l]: in the second line

[07:23] micheil: I think your array is not an array of strings, but rather an array of objects
[07:23] micheil: [ObjectID, ObjectID, ObjectID]

[07:48] SubStack: sholmes: were you trying to have a db global or some such?
[07:49] trollboy: so how much over head does node.js take on the server?   I've got a memcache server serving up json'd content (mysql/json/php), and I'm about sold on re-writting it in node.js
[07:49] prettyrobots: trollboy: Not much.
[07:50] trollboy: anyone else have experience doing cache servers in it?
[07:50] sholmes: SubStack: Yes. Well, I only have one main db in my app. I was talking about model modules, and you said it would be good for me to put the db connection in it's own module, then require it in the other modules.
[07:50] sholmes: ..or something like that.
[07:51] Ond: Yes marlun, that's possible

[07:54] sholmes: trollboy: what do you mean? I'm switching over to Node and rewriting it in that.
[07:55] prettyrobots: Nevermind, find a nice framework. I'm only going to be confusing. People say *great* things about Backbone.js.
[07:55] marlun: Ond: thanks, I'll try that!
[07:55] prettyrobots: sholmes: Have a look at Backbone.js.
[07:55] prettyrobots: I haven't used it, but I like that guy's work.

[08:04] prettyrobots: Guess it's time to go sleep.
[08:05] JojoBoss has joined the channel
[08:05] sholmes: prettyrobots: yeah, it's more front end.
[08:05] dve has joined the channel
[08:06] sholmes: micheil: yeah I'm using felixge's mysql module
[08:08] micheil: sholmes: there's two approaches to structuring your applications in node.js (that I know of)
[08:08] micheil: 1) is to put common stuff in modules and then require it in
[08:09] micheil: 2) is to put common stuff centrally, and require other stuff in
[08:09] marlun: Ond: I've tried it: https://gist.github.com/922968 but nothing happends when running it. 
[08:09] sholmes: micheil: don't understand #2
[08:09] micheil: (as in, you load up all you're models and controllers and stuff into one index.js, and then also load up the db, then all instances in index.js share the db)
[08:10] micheil: so, rather then having three modules: a, b, and c make a database connection through requiring a "new" 'dbc'
[08:10] seivan has joined the channel
[08:10] micheil: you have one file that requires a, b, c and dbc
[08:10] micheil: then passes each of a, b, and c the instance of dbc
[08:14] sholmes: micheil: I'm not really sure why I would do that, and I'm not certain I fully understand.
[08:15] micheil: basically in the each module requires in the dbc, you're creating one database connection per module
[08:15] micheil: where as in the latter, where you require all modules into one file, then pass a dbc, you create only one database connection and share it between all mdoules
[08:16] sholmes: The more obvious way, and the way I'm doing it, is I'm requiring a model when I need it, that module requires the db module and uses it. Same goes for other models I make.
[08:16] sholmes: I think I understannd now. Which is better though?
[08:17] micheil: well, obviously each has it's own needs.
[08:17] micheil: the former I think works well were you have a modular application, then latter I think works well for the more traditional type web application
[08:18] micheil: so, always remember, each time you require a file in another module that's a new instance of it.
[08:18] sholmes: what's a modular application?
[08:19] micheil: modular application in the sense that you have a set of common things that several processes share
[08:19] micheil: eg, you might have a data collector for twitter, facebook and last.fm audioscrobbles.
[08:19] micheil: you probably would implement that logically as three separate javascript files, each run by a separate node.js process
[08:20] micheil: there's little shared data apart from basic settings and configuration and shortcuts on creating specific objects
[08:20] Ond: Launch it in a new shell, marlun?
[08:20] micheil: a new process.
[08:20] sholmes: Each require of a module isn't a new process is it?
[08:20] micheil: no
[08:21] micheil: but it is a new instance of that module, unless that module already exists in the current module
[08:22] sholmes: What's the overhead then? If a module is required, doesn't the script just load and cache for when you use it. If the variable referencing the required module get's destroyed, so does the cache for the script?
[08:22] micheil: but it's not the same instance
[08:22] micheil: require('database') in module:a != require('database') in module:b
[08:22] Olivier has joined the channel
[08:23] tk has joined the channel
[08:23] micheil: if require('database') returns a constructor
[08:23] sholmes: micheil: that makes sense.
[08:23] micheil: so I'm pretty sure you can't share connections across modules
[08:24] micheil: (it would be very cool if you could, however, but that would imply some form of global scope)
[08:24] micheil: and there is no real global scope in node.js
[08:25] sholmes: you mean mysql connections?
[08:26] d0k has joined the channel
[08:28] Phyllio has joined the channel
[08:28] sholmes: micheil: hang on. You mean even if I were to require the same module within my model modules and that required module looked like: ...
[08:28] micheil: yes, each module that requires that module that defines your database connection will get a new instance of your connection
[08:28] sholmes: https://gist.github.com/922971
[08:30] sholmes: micheil: this could potentially blow up in my face though, sense each model has it's own connection, it would seem like that could bit me in the butt.
[08:30] micheil: I'm just testing this.
[08:30] sholmes: my mysql server could get overloaded
[08:30] sholmes: or something.
[08:30] garrensmith has joined the channel
[08:31] sholmes: Sense these model modules only get required when there's http requestions, maybe it's not so bad.
[08:32] sholmes: the database connections would die after my HTTP request has returned a response, right?

[08:37] qFox has joined the channel
[08:38] micheil: ah, yes, I was wrong.
[08:38] micheil: a requires connection, b requires connection
[08:38] micheil: internally, connection module is loaded once, then cached.
[08:38] micheil: so a's connection module === b's connection module
[08:39] sholmes: really? Is this only so with mysql's module?
[08:39] micheil: no, this is with all node.js modules
[08:39] micheil: isaacs, ryah, and you guys about to comment?
[08:39] techwraith: ACTION is also interested
[08:39] isaacs: whut?
[08:39] isaacs: comment on what?
[08:40] sholmes: isaacs: it appears micheil has discovered that modules are cached
[08:40] isaacs: yes, that's by design :)
[08:40] isaacs: if it's the same file, it's the same object.
[08:40] micheil: I originally thought that each instance was a fresh creation, hence no sharing of state across modules
[08:40] micheil: by having the same parent modules
[08:40] isaacs: nope.
[08:41] micheil: a <->  connection <-> b
[08:41] micheil: I thought it was actually two isolated instances.
[08:41] isaacs: otherwise circular require() paths would be unresolveable
[08:41] isaacs: if it resolves to the same filename, it's the same object.
[08:41] techwraith: That's how you got around it!
[08:41] techwraith: :)
[08:41] isaacs: don't rely on that.
[08:41] micheil: don't rely on that? why not?
[08:42] isaacs: because require("foo") might resolve to a different file in a different place
[08:42] micheil: oh, yes, that's very true, but if you're doing relative stuff, you'd be fine.
[08:42] Phyllio has joined the channel
[08:42] isaacs: yep
[08:42] coreb has joined the channel
[08:42] micheil: shit. why did I not realise this before?
[08:43] isaacs: dunno.  probably cause it Just Worked :)
[08:43] isaacs: it mostly does
[08:43] micheil: I always knew that the file contents was cached, and the resolved paths, just not that the exports objects were too
[08:43] isaacs: it's just when you hit some weird edge that this matters.
[08:43] ircretary has joined the channel
[08:43] sholmes: wait, would this have a side effect?
[08:44] micheil: sholmes: possibly.
[08:44] __tosh has joined the channel
[08:44] isaacs: some side effects: require("x") might not be "finished" when ou get it
[08:44] micheil: depends if you want connection pooling / multiplexing databse connections
[08:44] seivan has joined the channel
[08:44] sholmes: If a module is dynamic enough to create it's exports based on something variable, like time, would a second attempt at requiring the module prevent it from executing?
[08:44] micheil: ie, you want a and b to have separate db connections
[08:45] sholmes: Or am I missing the point?
[08:45] micheil: no, as long as the paths are the same, then it'd be the same module.
[08:46] sholmes: micheil: of course, if the paths are the same, it's the same module. However, the point is that two requries to the same module are both the same object.
[08:46] sholmes: this would mean a module like:
[08:46] micheil: yes, that's correct.
[08:46] sholmes: module.exports = new Date();
[08:46] isaacs: micheil: here's the edge case: https://gist.github.com/922986
[08:46] sholmes: would only be the date of the first require.
[08:46] isaacs: sholmes: ^
[08:46] micheil: a requires c and b requires c, c is the same in both instances
[08:47] isaacs: setting module.exports is even worse in that case.
[08:47] isaacs: you *must* set module.exports before some other module require()s it
[08:47] isaacs: should be the first thing in the module if you set module.exports
[08:47] k1ttty has joined the channel
[08:47] isaacs: or don't refer to the things on the returned export object until the requires are all resolved.
[08:48] micheil: isaacs: however, something like a database connector, where the method to get a connection will also spawn a connection if no connection already exists would be considered perfectly safe
[08:48] sholmes: isaacs: huh? That line is the entire module.
[08:49] micheil: (you're no longer referring to properties but instances)
[08:49] isaacs: you should not rely on modules being "global" in this way, though.  it's an implementation detail.
[08:49] isaacs: your code should be such that it might be identical, or might be different, or might have been hot-reloaded, or whatever.
[08:49] micheil: isaacs: it's that long standard thing of how do you actually structure an application in multiple files with node.js
[08:50] micheil: *long standing
[08:50] isaacs: sure
[08:50] isaacs: it's not that hard, though
[08:50] sholmes: isaacs: btw, I think you made a typo in your gist; line 1 of x.js

[09:29] sholmes: micheil: then how would I clear that cache?
[09:30] mikl has joined the channel
[09:30] cloudhead__: V1: there's a bunch of things to consider
[09:31] cloudhead__: like what regexps you use
[09:31] cloudhead__: you have to try to keep string length low as much as possible
[09:31] cloudhead__: if you're going to do matching or slicing on it
[09:31] V1: I basically want to get more ops/sec out of my Memcached driver, I already went from 24k ops/sec to 67k  ops/sec by caching my key => server lookup, but I do think the parser could use some tweaks as well
[09:32] micheil: hmm..
[09:32] V1: this is my parser btw: https://github.com/3rd-Eden/node-memcached/blob/v0.0.1/lib/memcached.js#L264-509

[09:33] V1: I could probalby save a few ms, by caching regexps instead having them created on each parser call.
[09:34] cloudhead__: V1: from a quick glance, maybe see if you can iterate differently than shift()
[09:34] cloudhead__: and also try to avoid str += foo if str is big
[09:34] cloudhead__: try push() then join() in those situations

[09:37] jackbach: hi there!
[09:37] cloudhead__: V1: it sped things up a lot for me, but I was dealing with several Ks of data on average, and the parser was bigger
[09:37] mikl has joined the channel
[09:37] mikl has joined the channel
[09:37] sholmes: wait, so if I load a model module on one HTTP request, and then load it again on another HTTP request, the second load won't occur because it's already cached?
[09:37] cloudhead__: might not be a huge deal for memcached type stuff, especially that you don't really need to parse the data
[09:37] cloudhead__: sholmes: yes
[09:37] V1: The max length of a single response is limited to a length of 1048576 cloudhead__ 
[09:38] sendark has joined the channel
[09:38] cloudhead__: V1: that's pretty big, but you don't need to parse the data right?
[09:39] thalll has joined the channel
[09:39] V1: cloudhead__: I depends on "flag" that is returned, as you can also store JSON and <buffers> with my driver
[09:39] boaz has joined the channel
[09:39] V1: But it's mainly strings that are returned
[09:39] cloudhead__: right, but then the json module takes care of that
[09:39] sholmes: cloudhead: to what extent is it cached then? I'm assuming that a method call will always generate something new?
[09:40] V1: cloudhead__: I don't need to further parse it, I only need to buffer it sometimes for multiple responses.. but thats about it
[09:40] cloudhead__: sholmes: well it's cached as in if you modify the file, it won't change anything
[09:40] cloudhead__: sholmes: yes, of course
[09:40] cloudhead__: sholmes: the exported object is cached, that's all
[09:41] sholmes: cloudhead: so all properties directly exported on an object are essentially worthless.
[09:41] cloudhead__: sholmes: they would be 'globals'
[09:41] cloudhead__: for that module
[09:42] cloudhead__: requiring a module is not like instantiating a class
[09:42] cloudhead__: so in that sense, yes
[09:43] cloudhead__: V1: ok should be good then
[09:43] sholmes: 'globals'? This seems very unconventional of a term in JS; it needs defining for me. I would see these things more or less as public properties, and would consider the private ones 'globals' if I had to say.
[09:43] sholmes: not familiar with what it means to instantiate a class (JS kiddie)
[09:44] FireFly|n900: 'globals' is a pretty common term
[09:44] FireFly|n900: variables in global scope, properties to the global 'this'
[09:44] cloudhead__: V1: I'd make sure this isn't a bottleneck: https://github.com/3rd-Eden/node-memcached/blob/v0.0.1/lib/memcached.js#L451
[09:44] marlun: Hmm I had to go before but could someone take a look at https://gist.github.com/922968 and tell me why it doesn't work. I would like to open vim let the user write to a file and then come back to node.js. Ond told me to launch it in a new shell but I don't understand.
[09:44] cloudhead__: V1: if there's lots of data, it could be one
[09:45] V1: cloudhead__: you suggesting I should use substr methods instead?
[09:45] V1: to chop out the data?
[09:45] FireFly|n900: [11:41:07] <sholmes> cloudhead: so all properties directly exported on an object are essentially worthless.
[09:46] FireFly|n900: What do you mean by this, sholmes?
[09:46] cloudhead__: V1: I would try to read the data without adding/cutting/searching as much as possible
[09:46] techwraith: sholmes: so you have a module: exports.property = 0; the first time you require it property is 0. then you do property++; Then you require it somewhere else; property is at zero in the second scope, but at 1 in the first scope.
[09:46] cloudhead__: V1: if you can get a way with a for() loop which reads by index, that's ideal
[09:46] sholmes: FireFly|n900, 'this' isn't that global, in fact, it's local to a function scope, so long as that function is applied to an object or is a method of an object.
[09:47] FireFly|n900: Yes, but 'this' refers to the global object in global scope...
[09:47] cloudhead__: V1: and if you need to add data to a buffer incrementally, either use push() on an array, or use buffer.write or buffer.copy on a buffer
[09:47] angerman has left the channel
[09:47] FireFly|n900: v8> var global = this; global
[09:47] v8bot: FireFly|n900: {console:{log:function (x){console.out.push(pp…,out:[]},print:function print(x){console.log(x)…,pp:function pp(o,depth){return pp_r…,pp_r:function pp_r(o,d){var a=[],p if…}
[09:47] FireFly|n900: and so on
[09:47] FireFly|n900: v8> Object.keys(this)
[09:47] v8bot: FireFly|n900: ["console","print","pp","pp_r"]
[09:47] sholmes: FireFly|n900, I exagerated a bit. Properties to a required module would essentially be static, hard coded.
[09:47] V1: cloudhead__: thanks for the advice, will look in to it

[09:48] jackbach: the global thing: http://howtonode.org/object-graphs
[09:48] jackbach: is a really good post
[09:48] cloudhead__: V1: np, just remember everytime you do s += t where `s` is a string, it creates a brand-new string
[09:48] FireFly|n900: sholmes, yep, you'll have to use a function to get it dynamic
[09:48] V1: cloudhead__:  [str,str].join('') also creates a new string
[09:49] FireFly|n900: Yep, but [str,str,str].join("") creates one new string, str += str; str += str; creates two
[09:49] cloudhead__: V1: yea but only once
[09:50] cloudhead__: V1: you would only join() once all the data was appended to the array
[09:51] sholmes: techwraith, I don't think so. If you incremented the property then required the same module, the property would be incremented at 1 in the second module.
[09:51] V1: cloudhead__: ok.

[09:53] cloudhead__: that's what makes module configuration possible
[09:53] cloudhead__: require('foo').configure({...})
[09:53] sholmes: what would that be used for?
[09:54] cloudhead__: to setup global settings for that module
[09:54] cloudhead__: for instance in a database module
[09:54] cloudhead__: you might be using accross 20 files
[09:54] cloudhead__: but you always want to connect to the same host/port
[09:54] cloudhead__: you would set that up at the module level
[09:54] cloudhead__: if the module provided an api for that

[09:57] AAA_awright: That's how it really should be done...
[09:57] AAA_awright: To anything that uses the database connection
[09:58] sholmes: AAA_awright, I should *pass* the db connection to my modules that need it, rather than make them go fetch it?
[09:58] AAA_awright: If you have a database configuration module like you linked to, that's good, but even then it should only be require()d once
[09:58] AAA_awright: Yes
[09:58] cloudhead__: I'm not saying you should set the connection up at the module level, just the default parameters
[09:59] cloudhead__: you still db.connect() in every file
[09:59] AAA_awright: Maybe sensible defaults
[09:59] AAA_awright: But not default values that would kill the program if they changed on you
[10:00] AAA_awright: Like, database connection information
[10:00] apoc has joined the channel
[10:00] cloudhead__: why would they change?
[10:00] grzesiek: anyone using node on ubuntu?
[10:00] sholmes: cloudhead__: wait, even though I db.connect(), the successive attempts to require db.js will not run the script again.
[10:00] cloudhead__: grzesiek: unfortunately, yes
[10:00] cloudhead__: sholmes: correct
[10:00] AAA_awright: Because it's a default?
[10:01] sholmes: cloudhead__: so I'm not calling db.connect() on every file that requires db.js.
[10:01] cloudhead__: AAA_awright: well then you're explicitly changing it and you know what you're doing
[10:01] AAA_awright: If you're accepting the default that means you're going to let the library pick something sensible
[10:01] cloudhead__: well no that's why you configure it
[10:02] cloudhead__: require('library').setup(..my_defaults..)
[10:02] AAA_awright: So while you're configuring it why not just pass the connection data to the library that depends on it?
[10:02] cloudhead__: then any connect() would use those settings, unless specified otherwise
[10:02] AAA_awright: Why would you need to connect() to the same database multiple times, anyways?
[10:03] grzesiek: i have problem... i instaled node.. everything is ok, but after restart computer node not working... i type "export PATH=$HOME/local/node/bin:$PATH" and itd working with: "Your node instance does not have root privileges" what is wrong?
[10:03] grzesiek: ubuntu machine
[10:03] sholmes: AAA_awright: you wouldn't. This is the added benefit to having modules cached, I don't need to worry about multiple connections! :D
[10:03] cloudhead__: AAA_awright: it depends if you're using a wrapper around the db module or not
[10:03] AAA_awright: grzesiek: Can you get to the REPL?
[10:04] sholmes: cloudhead__, what's a wrapper?
[10:04] cloudhead__: sholmes: like your db.js, that's a wrapper
[10:04] grzesiek: AAA_ what is that? im preety new..
[10:04] sholmes: how is it a wrapper?
[10:04] AAA_awright: grzesiek: Read the documentation first?
[10:04] cloudhead__: it wraps the mysql module
[10:04] techwraith: grzesiek: type 'node' in the console
[10:05] grzesiek: not all of it
[10:05] hwinkel has joined the channel
[10:05] grzesiek: node in console is working.. but after node server.js there is that words
[10:05] bingomanatee has joined the channel
[10:06] sholmes: cloudhead__: Ugh, I'm losing context. :P What depends on whether or not a wrapper is used?
[10:07] grzesiek: something is wrong with privilages
[10:07] AAA_awright: sholmes: I'm saying if you have a small module that contains the database information and creates a single new connection, and returns the connection instance, that's cool, that's loaded once by the main code and passed as an argument to any called libraries that also need the connection
[10:07] AAA_awright: grzesiek: No you shouldn't need root at all
[10:08] shaunau_ has joined the channel
[10:08] AAA_awright: grzesiek: Wait what program are you running?
[10:08] eb4890 has joined the channel
[10:08] AAA_awright: A *program* might need root to do stuff
[10:09] grzesiek: program? i type in terminal: cd ... & node.js -> it is working but with that words "Your node instance does not have root privileges. This means that the flash XML policy file will be served inline instead of on port 843. This will slow down initial connections slightly"
[10:09] sholmes: AAA_awright: I see. Well, I'm doing this, except, I'm not passing it to the libs that need it, rather, I'm requiring it from within the libs. But, I suppose that's fine too, sense it doesn't matter because modules are cached anyway.
[10:09] stephank has joined the channel
[10:09] grzesiek: ehhh node server.js of course
[10:09] AAA_awright: I'm not familiar with server.js what's that

[10:11] techwraith: That's a socket.io warning I think
[10:11] sholmes: I call it app.js
[10:11] AAA_awright: sholmes: It'll work the same but it's not flexible beyond that, it's a bad coding paradigm because it's looking for some user-defined place for a database connection instead of something passed by the application, uh
[10:11] grzesiek: server.js is from "https://github.com/solisoft/Socket.IO-node/blob/master/example/server.js"

[10:12] sholmes: AAA_awright, in other words, it'll be harder to change later on.
[10:12] AAA_awright: grzesiek: So it needs to open a port <1024, why you can't do that without root don't ask me I didn't write the OS but just start the thing with sudo
[10:12] techwraith: it doesn't need to, it should be ok, it'll just be a bit slow for the flash fallback
[10:13] AAA_awright: sholmes: That's the short answer I guess, yes
[10:13] sholmes: Well, I'd still have to change the line of code where it's passed for each library, which is an identical scenario.
[10:13] AAA_awright: techwraith: I thought it was flash that needed a port<1024
[10:14] grzesiek: sudo node server.js <- not working
[10:14] techwraith: AAA_awright: it is, but it's just a fallback, if it can't connect on flash, it'll fallback to another transport (http polling maybe)
[10:14] sholmes: identical to having to change the line of code were it's required in each library.
[10:14] techwraith: grzesiek: What do you mean by not working?
[10:14] AAA_awright: sholmes: You should be implementing as much of the program as possible as libraries, and a library that gets runtime level configuration from a module isn't a library at all
[10:14] AAA_awright: That's my reasoning
[10:14] grzesiek: message: "sudo: node: command not found"
[10:14] AAA_awright: Node.js makes it really easy to do that, though some people still don't for some reason
[10:14] AAA_awright: *npm*cough*

[10:15] techwraith: grzesiek: Run it without sudo, then go to http://127.0.0.1:{whatever-port-it's-running-on}
[10:16] AAA_awright: sholmes: Like, database configuration
[10:16] techwraith: grzesiek: most likely - http://127.0.0.1:8080
[10:16] seivan has joined the channel
[10:17] AAA_awright: sholmes: Something that doesn't change through any of the calls or anything... Just because of that you *can* put it in a module (since a module doesn't change) doesn't mean you *should*, you should treat it as something that can change, and sometimes it even does (what if you want to connect to two databases)
[10:17] jackbach: yesterday i got node working, but don't know why today it thorws this error...
[10:17] sholmes: AAA_awright: hmm. Well, firstly, my libraries are really model files. In a way, all my model files plus the db.js will be apart of a whole API. That is in a sense, my library.

[10:54] jetienne: jonaslund: ah yep the appcache stuff 
[10:54] jonaslund: what's it caching?
[10:54] jetienne: jonaslund: i use appcache offline storage to speedup download
[10:54] jetienne: jonaslund: the data used by the game.
[10:55] jetienne: jonaslund: not much, the sound, the texture
[10:55] jonaslund: wouldn't setting the cache headers from the server be easier ?
[10:55] jetienne: jonaslund: yep. http://pacmaze.com is a workinprogress. i will release a new game twice a month
[10:55] jetienne: jonaslund: so next version will be eassier on user. this one is the first
[10:55] [AD]Turbo: jetienne, it looks really nice
[10:56] jetienne: [AD]Turbo: thanks
[10:56] jetienne: jonaslund: maybe i should use appcache only on browser which doesnt require popup..
[10:57] jonaslund: it was kinda slow for me (chrome 10.0.648.204)
[10:57] jetienne: jonaslund: ok can you do "ping pacmaze.com" and gimme the latency ?
[10:57] jonaslund: jetienne: yeah, i never run java applets that requires you to allow it all kind of shit through certificates
[10:57] jonaslund: eventhough i know that those certificates are mostly used to get net connection
[10:58] jonaslund: 108ms
[10:58] jetienne: jonaslund: hehe this is common. people dont like to answer 10 questions before playing a game :)
[10:59] jetienne: jonaslund: hmm ok so 2 possibilities. either the slowness you see is due to the high ping (i got 24ms here as the server is in paris) or just your graphics card is not well supported by webgl
[10:59] stride: award badges for every hole in the user's firewall and they will click that button. :))

[11:01] jetienne: jonaslund: your latency is funky, are you on wifi ? where are you physically
[11:01] jonaslund: wifi in sweden
[11:01] jonaslund: my net uplink is pretty fast though
[11:01] jonaslund: my network is a .11g net
[11:01] jonaslund: with plenty of neighbours
[11:01] jetienne: jonaslund: yep but the regularity is no good on wifi
[11:01] jonaslund: jellyfish looks smooth
[11:02] jetienne: jonaslund: ok so the issue is in the network
[11:02] jonaslund: jetienne: what do you do with the network ?
[11:02] jetienne: jonaslund: being silly :)
[11:02] jetienne: jonaslund: pacman is a single player game BUT all the engine behind is for multiplayer game
[11:03] jonaslund: cool
[11:03] jetienne: well a bit ashamed to require good net connection for a pacman :)
[11:04] jetienne: especially as the server is in node.js i should port it to all browsers...
[11:04] jonaslund: well i do see the point of testing out stuff
[11:05] jonaslund: i'm doing some game stuff aswell and i'm trying to design everything in a timestep fashion
[11:05] jonaslund: erm
[11:05] jonaslund: not timestep
[11:05] jonaslund: time prediction fashion
[11:05] jonaslund: so everything looks smooth between iterations even if you have latency
[11:06] jetienne: jonaslund: not sure to understand... you mean like "release on time" ?
[11:06] jetienne: ACTION failed to sleep last night
[11:07] jonaslund: jetienne: i mean more like, the simulation code says "update simulation to time X"
[11:07] jonaslund: jetienne: and all objects are simulated from their previous timepoint
[11:08] jonaslund: jetienne: now if i send an identical state to the clients from the server i can have the clients calculate the same state for arbitrary times unless some new orders has been given during the time
[11:08] jetienne: jonaslund: i think i understand what you mean
[11:09] jetienne: jonaslund: ok lets talk more on that later. my brain is so off i cant learn new things :)
[11:09] jonaslund: it's nothing groundbreaking really
[11:09] jonaslund: but it helps alot if you design the simulation for that from the start

[11:12] cellvia: jonaslund: how are you accomplishing that practically? do you have any code to share?

[11:13] matjas has joined the channel
[11:14] __tosh has joined the channel
[11:15] jetienne: cellvia: out of the blue, maybe to add some small time randomness while sending ? it may smooth the load
[11:15] stagas: cellvia: every object needs to be step based, so you get from the server a time or a frame position on every event, and simulate the 'real' position client side by advancing the state on every object * number of frames behind
[11:17] liar has joined the channel
[11:17] cellvia: wow thats def stimulating my brain, could you explain moer on "nd simulate the 'real' position client side by advancing the state on every object * number of frames behind"
[11:17] cellvia: how would you choose the * number of frames
[11:17] cellvia: is that referring to lag of the client?
[11:18] cellvia: as in,  the server will have a stepbased timer,  and the client will be updated based on its relationship to the current server-step?
[11:19] cellvia: jetienne: where would you insert the randomness?
[11:20] jetienne: stagas: this create a lag between user input action and the actual display of the action, no ? if yes how do you handle that ? by having a small number of frames ahead ?
[11:20] davidcoallier has joined the channel
[11:20] jetienne: cellvia: i was thinking that maybe your problem were about the burst of network at every tick, so i was suggesting to smooth it with some randomness
[11:21] jetienne: cellvia: it was out of the blue :)
[11:21] cellvia: jetienne:  practically that would mean, instead of sending at every tick, skip random amounts of ticks within a certain range of acceptability?
[11:22] stagas: cellvia: that's the easy part, the hard part is that for every new data, you need to move back the simulation in time and recalculate the corrected position
[11:22] cellvia: jetienne:  why not skip a predetermined amount of ticks?  i guess the randomness makes it less perceptible to the user?
[11:23] cellvia: stagas: wow, that sounds pretty complex...  do you know of any use cases with doing this or is it theoretical?  do MMOs do that sort of thing?
[11:23] jetienne: cellvia: i was thinking more... i need to send a message to X clients every 100ms... so i send messages at various time to spread the load
[11:24] jetienne: cellvia: just a tech used for low level network protocols
[11:24] stagas: cellvia: I think most fps multiplayer games work that way
[11:24] cellvia: jetienne: ohhh ok gotcha, good simple tech!
[11:25] jetienne: stagas: nice one. how did you learn it ? how can i learn stuff like that too ? :)
[11:25] cellvia: stagas: makes sense, i remember seeing effects like that when i played laggy FPS, where user position seemed to be recalculated on the fly

[14:32] tmedema: Folks, I was hoping to hear about your experiences with VPS/cloud providers. Basically I'm working on an app that'll use a lot of bandwidth, was looking for a cloud/VPS provider that provides high traffic plans for an inexpensive price
[14:32] tmedema: any suggestions?
[14:33] xtianw: I've never dealt with a lot of bandwidth, but I like linode a lot.
[14:35] a|i: when running 'npm install package' does the package get installed globally for all apps, or just for a specified app?
[14:35] a|i: confusing.
[14:35] tmedema: xtianw: I have credit at linode, but that's a typical example of a low bandwidth provider
[14:35] tmedema: for the price that is
[14:35] xtianw: How much bandwidth are you looking for?
[14:36] xtianw: a|i: globally
[14:36] tmedema: xtianw: well no fixed size, but I want to be able to update my bandwidth when needed without having to upgrade RAM / CPU as well - I am only proxying data so I do not need much RAM
[14:36] tmedema: because I never store things in memory other than temporary buffers
[14:36] tmedema: so I need a lot of bandwidth with relatively low RAM
[14:37] a|i: xtianw: why do I get that node_modules/ dir then? the packages are only available if node_modules/ dir axists for an app.
[14:38] tmedema: I believe VPSs are much cheaper when it comes to bandwidth than cloud hosters

[14:46] jeff_horton has joined the channel
[14:47] a|i: xtianw: git clone http://github.com/isaacs/npm.git ** cd npm && sudo make install
[14:47] a|i: xtianw: calling 'npm install module' without sudo doesn't work, giving this error: Error: EACCES, Permission denied '/Users/<myusername>/.npm/node-uuid/1.1.0/package.tgz'

[14:49] a|i: undefined
[14:49] xtianw: Well there's your problem
[14:50] a|i: I just followed the installation instruction.
[14:50] tmedema: jonaslund: quite weird the way they state the bandwidth though..
[14:50] a|i: npm page has 101 ways to install it, and none of them work fine under mac
[14:50] Lagnus has joined the channel
[14:51] xtianw: I just used the 'curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | npm_install=rc sh' method
[14:51] xtianw: I haven't installed from source in a long time, so I don't know why your config would be empty like that
[14:54] a|i: xtianw: that command fails for me, because: /Users/<myusername>/.npm is not writeable for the install script.
[14:54] Emmanuel__ has joined the channel
[14:55] a|i: the install script is not tun by the current user.
[14:56] a|i: sudo might work, but it's odd to sudo for you're own home dir.
[14:56] xtianw: Yeah, when I installed it I guess the command to install was 'curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh'
[14:57] a|i: heck, even sudo doesn't work!
[14:58] hwinkel has joined the channel
[14:58] a|i: xtianw: tries it with 'curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh' and 'npm config get root' still gives me undefined

[14:59] xtianw: Haha

[15:02] xtianw: That's weird
[15:02] xtianw: Yeah you could set those config values manually I guess
[15:02] a|i: well that get globalconfig gives me a path to a file, that file does not exist.
[15:03] a|i: it's just getting better and better.
[15:03] xtianw: So the config file isn't getting created at all
[15:03] a|i: but the script has the write access.

[15:45] Aikar: no
[15:45] Sbioko: I'm using HTML5 audio(.mp3 4 MB), and the loading process of it gets slower and slower after each request
[15:45] Aikar: it keeps em in memory for cache
[15:45] Sbioko: Aikar: thanks, how to force it to free resources?
[15:45] Aikar: i noticed after testing the speed of a 1gb file that same issue ;(
[15:45] Aikar: used express as a quick way to test a file lol
[15:45] Sbioko: Aikar: I'm using Express in my app too
[15:46] Sbioko: Aikar: so you don't know how to solve this problem?
[15:46] Sbioko: how to disable caching?
[15:46] Aikar: i udnno how to fix it, but there SHOULD be a config saying "dont cache big files" dunno if there is or not
[15:46] Aikar: i havent really explored much with express yet
[15:46] Sbioko: Or maybe I should use separate solutions for serving static files
[15:46] Sbioko: Node.js-powered too
[15:46] Aikar: yeah people seem to suggest using nginx to host static files
[15:47] Aikar: caching small js/css files is good
[15:47] Sbioko: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules#web-frameworks-static
[15:47] Aikar: just need a way to not cache large files

[15:49] keyvan: Aikar: right thats what i thought but even then its still short by 200mb

[17:55] Casperin: stagas: yes, I cloned it… which gave me version 0.5-pre which turned out quite unstable (duh), so I tried to reinstall from the tarball, and now it does tell me it's v. 0.4.6, but that doesn't matter. It still crashes (while it runs smoothly on my two linux machines)
[17:55] marcello3d: did you install with ./configure, make, then sudo make install?

[18:07] Casperin:  /Usr/bin/node
[18:07] marcello3d: curious
[18:07] marcello3d: mine is in /usr/local/bin/node
[18:07] marcello3d: (on mac)
[18:07] xtianw: Mine as well
[18:07] Casperin: marcello3d: was that an answer to your q as well? Or did you ask about the specific project?
[18:07] marcello3d: try deleting/renaming that one
[18:08] Casperin: I think it's because I install as sudo
[18:08] Casperin: will do
[18:08] xtianw: Nah, that shouldn't be the problem
[18:08] marcello3d: my guess, at a high level, is you have some borked compiled version that's higher priority in your path
[18:08] marcello3d: so you're building new versions, they're being put in /usr/local/bin/node
[18:08] Casperin: now it returns nothing (obviously)
[18:08] marcello3d: but you're not actually running them when you run node
[18:09] marcello3d: returns nothing or says command not found?
[18:09] Casperin: sounds very plausible
[18:09] Casperin: returns nothing
[18:09] Casperin: I might as well have just pressed enter
[18:09] marcello3d: what does which node say
[18:09] Casperin: nothing
[18:09] marcello3d: or that's what you're referring to
[18:09] marcello3d: ok
[18:09] Casperin: no error, nothing
[18:09] newy_ has joined the channel
[18:09] marcello3d: so node -v shouldn't work now
[18:09] Casperin: :)
[18:10] Casperin: right.. that throws an error that /usr/bin/node doesn't exist
[18:10] marcello3d: ok
[18:10] marcello3d: does it explicitly say /usr/bin/node doesn't exist? or just node doesn't exist?
[18:10] Casperin: -bash: /usr/bin/node: No such file or directory
[18:10] marcello3d: hmmm
[18:11] marcello3d: weird. wonder if you hvae some symlink going on
[18:11] harth has joined the channel
[18:11] Casperin: there's a /usr/bin/node-waf … I don't know if that tells you anything
[18:11] mscdex: sounds like it
[18:11] marcello3d: that's a separate program
[18:11] marcello3d: you can delete/rename that too
[18:12] Casperin: renamed it… doesn't change any commands though
[18:12] marcello3d: ok
[18:12] Casperin: I had to manually add the PATH to .bash_profile, but I removed that again
[18:13] Casperin: (just trying to think of things that could help shed some light here)
[18:13] marcello3d: well, not sure why it's complaining about -bash: /usr/bin/node: No such file or directory
[18:13] Casperin: because I renamed it?
[18:13] mscdex: yeah, it should say "command not found"
[18:13] mscdex: :S
[18:13] marcello3d: it should say: -bash: node: command not found
[18:13] Casperin: hmm interesting
[18:13] Casperin: it does say command not found, when I sudo node -v
[18:13] mscdex: must be symlinked or something ...
[18:13] marcello3d: mscdex: I tried making a symlink though
[18:14] suckerpunch has joined the channel
[18:14] mscdex: no, i'm saying maybe one already exists somewhere
[18:14] marcello3d: and it says the symlink doesn't exist, not the dereferenced symlink
[18:14] mscdex: i dunno
[18:14] mscdex: i mean a symlink to /usr/bin/node
[18:14] marcello3d: I know
[18:14] mscdex: :S
[18:15] marcello3d: I tried $ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/node /usr/local/bin/node, but running node still returns the same error
[18:15] Casperin: did you see my comment that it does say "command not found" when I type "sudo node -v"?
[18:15] marcello3d: sudo uses a different environment
[18:15] marcello3d: try echo $PATH
[18:15] marcello3d: and check if any of the folders on that list have a node in them
[18:15] mscdex: and sudo echo $PATH
[18:15] Casperin:  /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin/
[18:16] marcello3d: yea, just do like ls -al /usr/bin | grep node
[18:16] marcello3d: for each one
[18:16] akl: don't "sudo echo $PATH"
[18:16] akl: do sudo -i, then echo $PATH
[18:16] akl: it's expanding $PATH before it runs sudo, so you're looking at your original $PATH
[18:16] Casperin: I didn't…
[18:16] Casperin: okay
[18:16] cbiscardi has joined the channel
[18:17] marcello3d: sudo echo path doesn't matter though =P
[18:17] marcello3d: because sudo node -v says command not found

[18:17] marcello3d: ok that's super bizarre :)
[18:17] marcello3d: maybe you have some weird bash memory going on

[18:26] marcello3d: hmmm, why isn't that just integrated into the makefile/configure?
[18:26] mscdex: it used to be
[18:26] mscdex: a long while back

[18:27] Casperin: it's okay… I rarely build stuff… this one's a bit of an exception
[18:27] max_dev has joined the channel
[18:27] marcello3d: mscdex: so why'd they remove it
[18:27] mscdex: on my core i7-860, linux reports 8 "cpus" so using `export JOBS=8` before doing `make` lets me build in 34 seconds
[18:27] mscdex: :)
[18:28] marcello3d: you could probably also do JOBS=8 make
[18:28] mscdex: marcello3d: guess they wanted it to be up to the user to use how many cores
[18:28] mscdex: marcello3d: true, but i actually have it export upon bash login so i never forget it :)

[18:32] Casperin: does it make sense to try with a .dmg? I mean… will it do anything I didn't just try?
[18:33] marcello3d: not necessarily
[18:33] marcello3d: unless your build chain is effed up
[18:33] marcello3d: do you have xcode/etc installed?
[18:33] mscdex: and up to date?
[18:33] mscdex: :p
[18:34] Casperin: I think so… apple wanted me to download it to make django speak with mysql… I got an old version. It's definitely not up to date, since I wasn't too serious about django

[18:34] mscdex: :S

[18:37] marcello3d: does node.js require xcode/dev tools to be installed to build it?
[18:37] marcello3d: Casperin: well, if you have an old xcode, it's possible compiling could be wonky... especially if it's not installed properly
[18:37] kkaefer: marcello3d: yes
[18:38] kkaefer: marcello3d: os x doesn't ship with a compiler by default afaik
[18:38] marcello3d: yea I didn't think so

[21:41] arianrock: llkazu
[21:41] arianrock: listen(process.env.YOUR_PORT_ENV_VARIABLE)
[21:41] llkazu: sure, but i want to restrict node to ONLY listen to that port. and not allow any others
[21:41] llkazu: like cloud9 does
[21:41] arianrock: euhm, it only listens on that port
[21:42] arianrock: It only listens on the port you parse to the listen function?
[21:42] arianrock: why would it bind any other ports?
[21:42] llkazu: I'm building out a node hosting platform. i want to restrict untrusted code to run only on a port i assign.

[21:48] arianrock: not sure though
[21:48] llkazu: wibby, yes. lol. nodejs releases VERY quickly.
[21:48] llkazu: arianrock, that would change it system-wide whereas i want to restrict per-user or per-process
[21:48] llkazu: :-/
[21:48] arianrock: modify the code?
[21:49] wibby: does somebody keep a repository? i actually like installing through synaptic
[21:49] arianrock: euhm
[21:49] llkazu: i was hoping not to have to modify nodejs itself, but ya thats a possibility.
[21:49] arianrock: sudo apt-get install node
[21:49] arianrock: then use update manager
[21:49] arianrock: it will update to 4.6
[21:49] arianrock: did it for me
[21:49] llkazu: another possibility would be to simply prevent all TCP bindings and force the code to use unix sockets. and have nginx proxy form 80 to the appropriate unix socket for whatever application
[21:49] arianrock: llkazu,
[21:50] arianrock: server._listen = server.listen
[21:50] arianrock: server.listen = function (port,etc) { checkport(port); server._listen(port)};
[21:50] arianrock: cheers
[21:51] arianrock: wasn't that hard was it? (A)
[21:51] llkazu: ah, but then the user could simply revert that in their code by doing: server.listen = server._listen
[21:51] llkazu: or just calling server._listen directly
[21:51] arianrock: idea
[21:52] arianrock: wait, no nvm
[21:52] arianrock: well the way cloud9 does it
[21:53] wibby: arianrock: you must be mistaken, i just checked the update manager
[21:53] arianrock: it locally connects to C9_PORT
[21:53] wibby: unless you use a repository i don't know of
[21:53] arianrock: then pipes it to 8080

[22:23] mscdex: before you have time to set the variable
[22:23] astropirate: ahh
[22:23] astropirate: right :p
[22:23] astropirate: thanks

[22:41] n2liquid: how can I set the headers for require('https').request()?
[22:41] cloudhead2: n2liquid: pass the 'headers' option
[22:41] n2liquid: I noticed there used to be a createClient() function, but it doesn't exist anymore, am I right?
[22:42] n2liquid: cloudhead2: it's not documented; is that really it?
[22:42] billbad has joined the channel
[22:42] cloudhead2: it should be documented
[22:42] cloudhead2: maybe check http.request
[22:42] cloudhead2: it's the same api
[22:42] boaz has joined the channel
[22:42] cloudhead2: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.6/api/http.html#http.request
[22:43] mscdex: http.createClient is deprecated
[22:43] n2liquid: crap
[22:43] cloudhead2: ah ah I See
[22:43] n2liquid: it's there indeed
[22:43] n2liquid: sorry, didn't see that, thx
[22:43] cloudhead2: it doesn't specify you can send headers
[22:43] cloudhead2: but yea
[22:43] cloudhead2: you can
[22:44] n2liquid: cloudhead2: actually it does: "headers: An object containing request headers."
[22:44] n2liquid: derp
[22:44] n2liquid: sorry about that
[22:44] mscdex: cloudhead2: it does specify

[22:54] mscdex: i have to see if i can get my cisco phone set up again and get more reliable audio streaming with that module
[22:55] n2liquid: mscdex: what do you work with professionally? just curious
[22:55] mscdex: what do you mean?
[22:55] n2liquid: are you employed?
[22:56] mscdex: yeah, freelance stuff
[22:56] n2liquid: ah, cool
[22:56] mscdex: almost all of my work with node is non-paid though :p
[22:56] mscdex: unfortunately
[22:56] n2liquid: kudos for it, then :D
[22:56] n2liquid: hope that changes soon, though

[22:57] n2liquid: so is node a matter of love or something?
[22:57] mscdex: pretty much ;)
[22:57] mscdex: it's just so easy to do stuff with
[22:57] mscdex: and it just works
[22:58] n2liquid: yeah, I know
[22:58] n2liquid: I've started using it like a few days ago
[22:58] n2liquid: and crap, developing is so simple

[22:59] arianrock: n2liquid, it's awesome
[23:00] n2liquid: it's funny to see how simple it is and yet how other language's concepts fit in so well
[23:00] n2liquid: I think that's pretty common between scripting languages, but node sets JS appart
[23:00] n2liquid: apart*
[23:01] n2liquid: btw, are there other worthy CommonJS implementations?
[23:01] n2liquid: why is node so cool?
[23:01] arianrock: i actually use coffeescript to program in node :P
[23:01] n2liquid: arianrock: hah, I see
[23:01] n2liquid: gotta try that later
[23:01] n2liquid: I just don't like the syntax much
[23:01] arianrock: http://pastebin.com/ZNzALubK
[23:01] n2liquid: used to C-style brackets
[23:01] arianrock: same
[23:02] arianrock: coffee = haskell+python+ruby+js mix
[23:02] arianrock: xD

[23:02] arianrock: btw thats a fully functional chat server in 16 lines
[23:02] arianrock: :3
[23:02] n2liquid: can't pure JS do that?
[23:03] n2liquid: I saw Ryan doing one in a talk
[23:03] n2liquid: didn't look like many lines
[23:04] industrial: n2liquid: ehm, pure js can doanything coffee can, thats the point..
[23:04] arianrock: coffee is just one step more minimalistic
[23:04] arianrock: ya
[23:04] mscdex: you could make a chat server in one line
[23:04] mscdex: just don't use newlines
[23:04] mscdex: ;)
[23:04] arianrock: u can use js libs in coffee
[23:04] arianrock: etc
[23:04] arianrock: ya I did that
[23:04] arianrock: sec
[23:04] arianrock: http://pastebin.com/0HBeK1HL
[23:04] arianrock: same server
[23:04] n2liquid: industrial: I didn't mean he couldn't do a chat server like that, but the same thing with as many lines or something

[23:30] killfill: anyone use express-resource?.. cannot make .upadte work.. :S
[23:33] n2liquid: mscdex: are you satisfied with the NPM modules available? I was thinking about sketching some module guidelines for node and CommonJS in general, but I'd need help from someone more experienced
[23:33] mscdex: guidelines?
[23:33] febits has joined the channel
[23:33] n2liquid: yes
[23:33] n2liquid: for example
[23:34] n2liquid: I've been looking for a good solution to access Twitter, Facebook and whatnot API's
[23:35] n2liquid: but each was tied to their own useless dependencies (e.g. connect), weren't actively developed and I couldn't take many good things from each to actually build something good
[23:36] n2liquid: if modules didn't directly depend on modules, but instead exposed their necessities that could be fulfilled by the modules that included them, the world would probably be a better place
[23:37] n2liquid: e.g. why require('http') when you're writing something that could also run in a browser?
[23:37] broofa has joined the channel

[23:38] mtsl: I'd like to access FOUND_ROWS() with the mysql module, how am I supposed to do that? I can't be sure if there's another query after my LIMIT'd query

[23:39] Rob- has joined the channel
[23:39] n2liquid: sometimes I'm scared it looks like no one is bothered with tying their code to the tools they have at hand and make them incompatible with anything else where their work could have been useful

[23:48] echosystm: tias?
[23:49] konobi: try it and see
[23:51] n2liquid: mscdex: didn't agree, eh?
[23:55] mscdex: n2liquid: sorry, was afk for a bit
[23:55] n2liquid: mscdex: no prob, just wanna hear your opinion
[23:55] n2liquid: this is bothering me a little
[23:56] n2liquid: I don't love NodeJS if its projects are gonna have the same problems that bothered me on C++
[23:56] konobi: echosystm: ie, you can just checkout the v8 branch into your nodejs checkout
[23:56] mscdex: n2liquid: it depends on the module, some utilize things that can't be used/done browser-side
[23:57] Aikar: woot
[23:57] Aikar: msgpack library fixed
[23:57] Aikar: wormhole is now usable!
[23:57] konobi: n2liquid: time to volunteer to help isaacs with npants
[23:57] n2liquid: mscdex: maybe they can't today, who knows?
[23:57] Aikar: so just a lil more polish on it then ready for public release :D
[23:57] mscdex: n2liquid: by the way, have you seen node-browserify?
[23:57] echosystm: im looking at the experimentalg gc changelog - it doesnt seem to be getting as much attention as i thought it would
[23:57] n2liquid: mscdex: nope, but I'll take a look
[23:58] echosystm: most of the commits seem to be just merged from the main
[23:58] n2liquid: konobi: what's that?
[23:58] konobi: n2liquid: ask isaacs =0)
[23:58] mscdex: n2liquid: https://github.com/substack/node-browserify
[23:58] n2liquid: konobi: isn't that explained somewhere?
[23:58] mscdex: n2liquid: you can also use dnode for doing server-side things from the browser
[23:59] n2liquid: mscdex: ah, I actually knew browserify, but that's not all
[23:59] echosystm: isnt this gc issue a major problem for node?
[23:59] echosystm: as in, should be #1 priority?
[23:59] n2liquid: mscdex: dnode looks actually interesting
