[00:45] tommyvyo has joined the channel
[00:46] isaacs: timbl: oh, nvm, you need to install scons

[00:46] timbl: tx ... I've used port before
[00:46] isaacs: maxogden: hey
[00:47] isaacs: maxogden: i agree that supporting nested deps with bundleDependencies would be good
[00:47] polotek: I really need to update libxmljs
[00:47] isaacs: maxogden: it's on the very short list.
[00:47] maxogden: isaacs: woohoo!
[00:47] polotek: isaacs: are you guys liking gyp? you think it's worth using in native modules?
[00:47] isaacs: maxogden: there are three modules in npm that need to be rewritten asap
[00:47] isaacs: and i'm taking two weeks off at the end of the year, so that needs to happen this week, probably
[00:48] isaacs: maxogden: here's the catch:
[00:48] isaacs: you must use 0.6!!

[00:50] ryah: scons comes with node - there should be no reason to install
[00:51] polotek: ryah: haha, that's funny
[00:51] polotek: I asked you a while back if it was feasible to use the included scons
[00:51] ryah: isaacs, timbl --^
[00:51] polotek: and you said no
[00:51] polotek: Like it was specific to v8 or something
[00:51] timbl: There is an included scons in node, but it can't be used for builds of npm modules?
[00:52] ryah: polotek: for building addons it's not feasible because we don't install it
[00:52] ryah: npm modules should not use scons
[00:52] polotek: ryah: yeah we're talking about libxmljs
[00:52] polotek: do you think gyp will become recommended way of building addons?
[00:52] adrianF has joined the channel

[00:53] ryah: well - that's broken then
[00:53] polotek: haha, it's not broken, you just need scons
[00:53] polotek: it's in the readme, and on the wiki
[00:53] polotek: Just most people don't bother reading until they get the error
[00:53] ryah: yeah - broken
[00:53] frabcus has joined the channel
[00:54] ryah: gyp will be the way for building addons starting in v0.8
[00:54] polotek: It's not unreasonable to expect that native modules may require additonal packages
[00:54] polotek: you also need libxml2 which doesn't come packaged
[00:54] timbl: The readme and the wiki I'm not going to read if several dependencies down .

[00:55] tbranyen: heh my nodegit project requires libgit2, which in turn requires cmake now
[00:55] tbranyen: which is a pita in os x unless you already have cmake
[00:55] ryah: does libxml2 use scons?
[00:55] polotek: but before I got to it, ryah started talking about gyp
[00:55] timbl: but anwaywat, now I have py 2.7 and scons ..    now I get scons: building terminated because of errors.
[00:55] polotek: ryah: I actually have no idea
[00:56] timbl: [src/html_document.os]
[00:56] timbl: I'm missing vb8.h
[00:56] timbl: I'm missing v8.h
[00:56] polotek: timbl: if you're building against 0.5 or newer it won't work
[00:56] polotek: libxmljs has not been updated
[00:56] timbl: I need some v8-dev ?

[00:58] zomg: blueadept: make it an array?
[00:58] tbranyen: blueadept: use a recursive function?

[01:00] timbl: Does libxmljs have any competition if I want to parse an XML file to a DOM?
[01:01] timbl: so I should encourage you to update it ,polotek  :)
[01:01] polotek: timbl: if you need a dom, then... not really
[01:01] polotek: but you could use one of the xml2js libraries
[01:01] polotek: that just give you js objects
[01:01] polotek: that usually all people want is to get at the data
[01:01] timbl: I 'm porting existing code which uses a DOM
[01:02] polotek: I have some pull requests to go through
[01:02] polotek: planned on doing it this weekend
[01:03] blueadept: polotek: wait, what is index?
[01:03] timbl: Maybe one of those pull requests will be an update :)
[01:03] polotek: blueadept: the index number of your loop
[01:03] blueadept: i see
[01:04] polotek: if you're using a forEach loop it's the second parameter to your iteration function
[01:04] polotek: if you're using jQuery, then it's the first paramter
[01:04] polotek: because jQuery is bass ackwards

[01:13] tbranyen: polotek: yeah, that would be nice
[01:14] tbranyen: jbrokc: i think you can use this
[01:14] tbranyen: if not, pass it as a property
[01:14] tbranyen: { someprop: [array_here] }
[01:15] jbrokc: tbranyen: oh, so do something like template({data}) ?
[01:15] vicapow has joined the channel
[01:16] jbrokc: tbranyen: what would be the right format for the x-handlebars-template though? {{#each}} then? it's going to look like { [{name: 'foo'}, {name: 'bar'}] }
[01:17] maxogden: jbrokc: that woudl work if your data looked like { each: [{name: 'foo'}, {name: 'bar'}] }
[01:18] jbrokc: maxogden: oh, think I get it now. sucks just a straight up array doesn't work
[01:18] buu has joined the channel
[01:20] jbrokc: maxogden: hm, well, {{#list temp}}<li>{{name}}</li>{{/list}} doesn't quite work with template({ temp: data })
[01:20] jbrokc: oh that's… nevermind
[01:22] jbrokc: nah, neither with {{#each temp}} either
[01:22] maxogden: jbrokc: its just {{#temp}}
[01:22] jbrokc: maxogden: then {{/temp}} to close?
[01:23] maxogden: jbrokc: i think so... that should do each
[01:23] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[01:23] maxogden: {{#each temp}} {{name}} {{/each}} should work too
[01:24] maxogden: with {temp:[{name:'bob'}]}

[01:24] rwaldron has joined the channel
[01:25] jbrokc: maxogden:  and this.name doesn't work but i could try {{this name}}

[01:30] Bonuspunkt: Ron1 whats a metaquestion?
[01:30] Ron1: Hi.  I am trying to figure out how to explain it.
[01:31] Ron1: I have set up a simple server via http.createServer
[01:32] Ron1: when it is called, depending on the url, i want to call another website and aggregate some data.  I have been able to create the server and connect to the secondary server to get data.  I however cannot seem to send the data back to the original client, but can print to console.log.  
[01:32] Ron1: client -> my server -> google/bing/etc.

[01:33] spathi has joined the channel
[01:34] Ron1: Here is the basic flow and code.
[01:34] Ron1: From the client, I call the server which looks like this:
[01:34] Ron1: var http = require("http");
[01:34] Ron1: var url = require("url");
[01:34] Ron1: function start(route, handle) {
[01:34] Ron1:         function onRequest(request, response) {
[01:34] Ron1:                 var pathname = url.parse(request.url).pathname;
[01:34] Ron1:                 console.log("Request for " + pathname + " received.");
[01:34] Ron1:                 route(handle, pathname, response);
[01:34] Ron1:         }
[01:34] Ron1:         http.createServer(onRequest).listen(8888);
[01:34] Ron1:         console.log("Server has started.");
[01:34] Ron1: }
[01:34] Ron1: exports.start = start;
[01:34] Ron1: The route callsfunction route(handle, pathname, response) {
[01:34] Ron1:         console.log("About to route a request for " + pathname);
[01:34] Ron1:         if (typeof handle[pathname] === 'function') {
[01:34] Ron1:                 return handle[pathname](response);
[01:34] Ron1:         } else {
[01:34] Ron1:                 console.log("No request handler found for " + pathname);
[01:34] Ron1:                 response.writeHead(404, {"Content-Type": "text/plain"});
[01:34] Ron1:                 response.write("404 Not found");
[01:34] Ron1:                 response.end();
[01:34] Ron1:         }
[01:34] Ron1: }

[01:44] Ron1: I can hit my server, in turn it does a https.get to another site to get information (which I can print out using console.log).  I think my issue is not understanding how write the second requests output to the first request.
[01:44] Bonuspunkt: but https://gist.github.com/1130304 line 40-62 should give you a start

[01:48] Ron1: thanks bonuspunkt, I don't follow all of that yet.  I think I am just not understanding how async works in nodejs.  
[01:48] josephg: cipher__: correct.
[01:48] josephg: look at socket.io or sockjs
[01:49] cipher__: josephg, so the handshake will not even complete? i cannot just parse encapsulated data? :(

[01:52] Bonuspunkt: Ron1 start little, can you make a http request to a server and log the result to the console?
[01:52] ryan_stevens has joined the channel
[01:52] smathy: cipher__, websockets are the closest you can get to a raw TCP connection with a browser.
[01:52] augustl: can minimatch replace the glob module today? Seems like the latest version has fs traversal, minimatch(path, pattern, options)
[01:53] towski has joined the channel
[01:53] Ron1: @bonuspunkt, yes
[01:53] smathy: cipher__, it starts with an HTTP handshake and then switches to an open socket connection over which you can pass whatever data you like.
[01:53] smathy: ...two-way
[01:55] Bonuspunkt: Ron1 than you just need to write the stuff you receive to the server response and end on end

[01:55] moepigal124h: http://bit.ly/uPBolO
[01:56] Ron1: @Bonuspunkt, that is what I thought but something is not correct.  When myserver function runs, it launches another get request.  That request does work.  However I don't know how to make my server stick around and wait for the second get request to return its results.  
[01:56] cipher__: smathy, can i write the handshake response myself. (using the net protocol?)

[03:52] Phlogistique: but my callback never gets called
[03:52] Phlogistique: so I looked at the code
[03:52] Phlogistique: https://github.com/felixge/node-formidable/blob/master/lib/incoming_form.js
[03:52] Vennril2 has joined the channel
[03:52] Phlogistique: and it seems like onPart is only ever called by onHeadersEnd
[03:52] ed1t: polotek: i don't think its in json format its just multi part body
[03:52] meandi has joined the channel
[03:52] Phlogistique: which as far as I can see, is called nowhere
[03:53] Phlogistique: is this actually supposed to work?
[03:53] davidbanham has joined the channel
[03:53] polotek: ed1t: ah, then you'll want to use a module like formidable
[03:54] polotek: you don't want to try parsing multipart posts on your own
[03:54] polotek: Phlogistique: ha, yes I can assure that formidable works
[03:54] polotek: are you working with multi-part form data
[03:54] polotek: maybe gist some code
[03:54] maxogden: i dont know about you guys but i publish broken modules just to screw with people
[03:55] Phlogistique: polotek: yes I am working with multi-part
[03:55] polotek: maxogden: yeah I let mine languish without updates. it's how I get my kicks
[03:56] Phlogistique: http://codepad.org/0yqSUwF9 here's my code; I'll try to produce a minimal working exemple

[04:05] polotek: but one thing is that the readme says onPart doesn't do anything
[04:05] polotek: you have to override it yourself
[04:06] polotek: oh nevermind I see where you've set it
[04:06] polotek: although it looks like you're never calling form.parse

[04:29] Phlogistique: maxogden: oh, thanks
[04:30] polotek: Phlogistique: don't mean to patronize. but why would you think we're more capable than you are of finding where code is called?
[04:31] Phlogistique: polotek: as a matter of fact, maxogden was able to find it
[04:31] polotek: yes I saw that. how do you think he did it?
[04:31] Phlogistique: he was more familiar than me with a culture where you generate function names dynamically, so did a kind of fuzzy grep, I guess
[04:32] Phlogistique: or he knew the code already
[04:32] maxogden: well the first thing i did was look at where parser was coming from which was the multipart whatever module
[04:33] maxogden: then searched for 'headers' and it came up
[04:33] djMax: where are "in-use" copies of the core libraries kept? Want to put some logging in the htt flow
[04:33] maxogden: what i didnt do was accuse the project of being broken :)
[04:33] djMax: http
[04:34] Phlogistique: maxogden: sorry for that :)

[04:38] polotek: maxogden: rails is even worse
[04:38] polotek: you can't even follow where things get added to the scope

[04:43] polotek: create a new Error object on purpose and print err.stack

[05:12] djMax: thanks
[05:13] Aria: What are you editing exactly?
[05:14] djMax: https.js to put more logging
[05:16] djMax: Seems like https.request is the same as http.request?
[05:16] jaimef has joined the channel
[05:16] Aria: I'd think so.
[05:16] polotek: djMax: most core js modules in node are compliled into the binary
[05:16] polotek: so if you change them you have to rebuild
[05:17] mandric has joined the channel

[05:20] ryanrolds: Any way to check the module versions in package.json and get a list of modules with newer versions?
[05:23] jhurliman has joined the channel
[05:27] djMax: http://pastebin.com/xPbX865M - ideas?
[05:27] polotek: ryanrolds: I think npm ls will tell you if modules are outdated
[05:28] polotek: djMax: just means there's some error in an async stack
[05:28] djMax: it kills the server, which seems pretty evil
[05:28] polotek: find the part of the stack that is your code
[05:29] djMax: none of that
[05:29] polotek: djMax: nope, that's by design :) all errors need to be handled
[05:29] ryanrolds: polotek: Thank you for the lead.
[05:29] djMax: then this is internal problem with node. Fun.
[05:30] polotek: djMax: unless you're doing something really weird I would doubt that
[05:30] ryanrolds: djMax: Next nessarily. I have had that issue with I was trying to do some sort of socket or HTTP IO and I was doing something wrong.
[05:30] djMax: I call https.request, exception handler around that and a log on the first line of the callback. No exception, no log.
[05:30] polotek: that's a pretty common error when something blows up in your stack
[05:30] ryanrolds: *Not nes
[05:30] polotek: it's not always straight forward to find out what it is
[05:30] ryanrolds: Yeah, I have gotten that with I'm doing something wrong with HTTP or sockets.
[05:30] djMax: so what I know to be different than my working test is that the cert on the server is invalid
[05:31] polotek: djMax: you can't use try/catch
[05:31] polotek: with async code
[05:31] ryanrolds: What is the http.request trying to do?
[05:32] djMax: even in non-async code?
[05:32] polotek: try setting process.on('uncaughtException', function())
[05:32] polotek: djMax: if it involves process.nextTick it's async :)
[05:32] djMax: i.e. I'm surrounding the call to https.request in a try catch, and the first thing the callback does is print a log
[05:32] ryanrolds: polotek: If he is trying to communicate with another node instance that instance is crashing he can get that error.
[05:33] polotek: gist some sample code
[05:33] ryanrolds: A lot of times that error happens because the other side of the communication just dropped out, or he doing HTTPs on version of Node older then 0.4.11ish
[05:33] djMax: so uncaughtException stops the crash
[05:33] polotek: djMax: it catches exceptions before they reach the top of the stack and crash node yes
[05:34] polotek: but it's mostly a chance to let you shutdown cleanly
[05:34] polotek: if errors make it that far in your application, you should consider it a fatal error
[05:34] djMax: not sure I'd deploy a production server that way, but that argument is for another time.
[05:35] polotek: djMax: you should have the argument though
[05:35] polotek: the node way of doing things is a little different
[05:35] polotek: but there are reasons for all of this
[05:35] polotek: we've been having the argument for a few years now :)
[05:35] djMax: I just don't think any programming mistake should be allowed to crash my server for all the rest of the users.
[05:35] polotek: and it's informative, whether you end up agreeing or not
[05:35] _dc has joined the channel
[05:36] polotek: djMax: that's true, the difference is it's not node that's going to save you from that
[05:36] polotek: node is not like rails, it's like ruby
[05:36] polotek: if an error reaches the top in ruby, the process crashes
[05:36] polotek: same here
[05:36] polotek: the difference is that in node you have servers as first class primitives
[05:37] jzacsh has joined the channel
[05:37] djMax: I hate ruby. :)
[05:37] polotek: so it's a different environment than those that have come before
[05:37] polotek: add in the event loop and async breaks in execution
[05:37] polotek: and you've gotta come up with a different way of thinking about these things
[05:37] djMax: C#, Java for example have the concept of "bugs that don't kill me" and in fact it is almost impossible to kill an ASP.net server.
[05:38] djMax: but I think the beef I have is that it *seems* like I'd have to surround every handler in try/catch, and that's a bit heavy handed
[05:38] djMax: http://pastebin.com/S665pMuu
[05:38] polotek: those environments also have isolated threads, so it's much easier to reason that one request crashing isn't hosing up the state in other threads
[05:38] SamuraiJack has joined the channel
[05:38] polotek: that is not node
[05:38] polotek: it's helpful to compare, but you have to consider the differences as well as the things you would like to be the same
[05:39] ryanrolds: djbell: Listen for errors on post_req, not response.
[05:40] djMax: hmm, how? that request call is where it fails.
[05:40] mandric has joined the channel
[05:40] polotek: djMax: what do your post options look like?
[05:40] ryanrolds: post_req.on('error', function(err) {...});
[05:40] polotek: and what version of node are you running
[05:40] djMax: too late
[05:40] djMax: 0.6.5
[05:41] Mustansir has joined the channel
[05:41] djMax: literally, https.request is what triggers the error. If I do nothing else after that, it still dies
[05:41] djMax: and I can't try/catch that line to stop it
[05:41] polotek: yeah I get that, but there's clearly something missing
[05:41] polotek: I can run this code right now and it works
[05:41] polotek: djMax: that's what I"m trying to tell you
[05:41] ryanrolds: http.ClientResponse doesn't emit 'error'.
[05:41] polotek: it's not https.request that is throwing
[05:42] polotek: it is after the async barrier
[05:42] polotek: so try/catch isn't going to work
[05:42] polotek: and it's before your callback
[05:42] polotek: so that won't work either
[05:42] polotek: or at least that's what it looks like to me
[05:43] ryanrolds: If he is getting a socket hangup, something is going on the other side.
[05:43] djMax: I'm switching it back to the server that does have a valid cert to verify that works
[05:43] ryanrolds: *going wrong on the
[05:43] polotek: what are your post options. I can run the code and see if I get what you get
[05:43] ryanrolds: Again, ClientResponse doesn't emit 'error'.
[05:44] polotek: you could also switch to an example using http.request on an endpoint that you know works
[05:44] polotek: if that works, it would at least narrow it down to a problem with https
[05:45] ryanrolds: ClientRequest, does emit 'error' because it's a WriteableStream.
[05:46] djMax: ok, verified that with a valid server cert, everything works fine
[05:47] ryanrolds: Cool, but, seriously, you need to fix that 'error' listener or any error from that request will crash your app.
[05:47] djMax: how?
[05:47] djMax: the line that makes the object is what throws.
[05:47] ryanrolds:  post_req.on('error', function(err) {...});
[05:47] djMax: I can't assign an on when it already threw
[05:48] ryanrolds: ClientResponse doesn't emit 'error', but ClientResponse does.
[05:48] polotek: djMax: are you sure it never returns from that function?
[05:48] ryanrolds: That socket hangup error you were getting should have been caught by the line a pasted.
[05:48] polotek: have you tried doing a console.error('after') there?
[05:48] djMax: you're right, I can assign it afterwards, though that seems like a horrid race condition
[05:48] ryanrolds: *line I posted
[05:49] polotek: djMax: it's not. javascript/node is single threaded
[05:49] ryanrolds: It's not.
[05:49] djMax: but got that error caught now with your code.
[05:49] djMax: ok, so it's just dropping off my fn and going back somewhere. Alright, I get my confusion there.
[05:49] ryanrolds: As long as you listen before you actually send(end) the request.
[05:49] polotek: if you assign the handler before yielding back to the event loop, nothing else is going to happen
[05:50] ryanrolds: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.6.5/api/http.html#http.request
[05:50] ryanrolds: See that for a good example
[05:50] ryanrolds: The callback you passed to htt.request wont get called util after you call .end().
[05:50] frabcus has joined the channel
[05:50] djMax: Ok, so now I guess I'm back to the original problem, which is why https.request gets ECONNRESET on a bad cert.
[05:50] ryanrolds: It may need to be before any writes too, but I would need to check.
[05:51] ryanrolds: Is it a bad cert?
[05:51] djMax: yes, it's a dev server
[05:51] polotek: I admit I don't have much experience with using https client requests
[05:51] isaacs has joined the channel
[05:52] polotek: ah, isaacs may be able to help you out
[05:52] ryanrolds: Are we talking about an invalid cret or a self-signed cert?
[05:52] djMax: Summary - https.request is failing when the server has a bad cert
[05:53] djMax: doesn't match the URL, not trusted.
[05:53] ryanrolds: Yesh
[05:53] ryanrolds: That is going to happen. It's doing just what it should.
[05:54] norviller has joined the channel
[05:54] ryanrolds: Make a self-signed cert for the dev server.
[05:54] ryanrolds: And have the dev server use it, that should work (at least it did in 0.4.x).
[05:54] djMax: URL is here: http://pastebin.com/MKYJ88bG
[05:54] djMax: I don't control that server
[05:54] ryanrolds: If you're using a bad/invalid cert http.request is doing exactly what it should.
[05:54] djMax: I could setup a tunnel I guess.
[05:55] djMax: Well, sort of. Because a proper client would allow me to participate in that validation
[05:55] ryanrolds: Not if the cert is not for that server.
[05:55] djMax: Of course it should
[05:55] ryanrolds: Make a self-signed cert.
[05:55] djMax: iOS, C#, Java, ruby all do this
[05:55] ryanrolds: Did you copy that cert from a different machine?
[05:55] djMax: I can't change the ceritificate on that server
[05:56] djMax: Who knows what they did with it. Probably were too lazy to create a different cert for each of 100 dev boxes or something
[05:56] nixer1102 has joined the channel
[05:57] djMax: I was reading through https and tls code but I really don't see where that verification is happening
[05:57] djMax: maybe it's an SSL3 thing and not a cert thing.
[05:57] fangel has joined the channel
[05:57] ryanrolds: Do you have a GET url you can do against that server from your browser?
[05:58] djMax: yep, looking at it now
[05:58] ryanrolds: I'm curious what your browser says about it.
[05:58] ryanrolds: What does it say about the https connection and cert?
[05:58] djMax: It does say that it had to do SSL3 negotiation, and the warnings I mentioned.
[05:58] djMax: But it still performs the get
[05:58] djMax: and "the server does not support TLS renegotiation"
[05:59] polotek: djMax: have you gotten other ssl jobs to work in your node build?
[05:59] djMax: yes, anything with a good cert
[06:00] polotek: okay, sounds like you just need to find the right configuration for what you're trying to do
[06:00] djMax: looks like stunnel or something similar is a more likely option to succeed
[06:00] djMax: I don't see any way to control the validation rules of the node https client
[06:00] ryanrolds: Are you able to make a self-signed cert on that server?
[06:01] CAP5792 has joined the channel
[06:02] djMax: no, I cannot make or change the certificate on that server
[06:03] ryanrolds: Probably screwed.
[06:04] ryanrolds: To be clear, you cant do step #2 of this: http://dotnetnuts.wordpress.com/2011/06/20/secure-nodejs-app-with-self-signed-certificate-step-by-step-tutorial/
[06:05] ryanrolds: You don't need to futs with certs for other thigns on the system, just make a cert to use in this app.
[06:06] djMax: I'm trying to call out to an SSL server, not be one
[06:06] polotek: isaacs: is there any setting to get https client to skip ssl verification?
[06:07] polotek: e.g. curl -k
[06:07] ryanrolds: Well you're calling out to poorly configured ssl server.
[06:07] JakeSays has joined the channel
[06:07] djMax: Don't blame the other side. :)
[06:08] ryanrolds: It is not poorly configured?
[06:08] ryanrolds: You're trying to work around what is a simple fix on the other end.
[06:08] ryanrolds: This is bad design.
[06:08] tglines has joined the channel
[06:08] djMax: Well no. Development machines with whacked out certs are very common. It's why every other language and utility includes this kind of thing
[06:10] polotek: djMax: yeah, there should be a way to just bypass ssl if you know what's going on
[06:11] djMax: hopefully I can setup stunnel to connect and ignore and then advertise a local http endpoint
[06:11] polotek: unfortunately for you, I know at least one of the guys that helped with node ssl support is super serious about security :)
[06:11] ryanrolds: Yeah, SSL is not something to be relaxed about.
[06:12] polotek: djMax: looksl ike nobody here right now to give you an alternative
[06:12] nicholasf has joined the channel
[06:12] polotek: but you should definitely post the mailing list about it

[06:12] gut4 has joined the channel
[06:12] polotek: some will argue, but I think you're right
[06:12] ryanrolds: You don't need to pay for a cert.
[06:12] ryanrolds: You can self-sign one, it doesn't even require root.
[06:12] djMax: ok, thanks for the help all. Definitely learned a couple things even though didn't figure out the core bit
[06:13] djMax: Self signed is invalid just the same, by the way
[06:13] ryanrolds: It's not.
[06:13] ryanrolds: I run self-signed certs in dev with node all the time.
[06:13] djMax: Of course it is, you're client shouldn't trust that cert.
[06:13] polotek: ryanrolds: it's pretty common to have to work with servers you don't control during development
[06:13] djMax: Unless I add it to the root chain, which is kind of like what I want to do
[06:14] ryanrolds: I guess I'm too used to working at startups.

[06:24] ryanrolds: This is such a simple fix.
[06:25] ryanrolds: Made the cert with this line:  openssl  req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out ./cert.pem -keyout ./cert.pem
[06:26] ryanrolds: Use it for the key and the cert.

[06:36] rohitcolinrao: nope… same, html5
[06:36] denysonique: rohitcolinrao: make a diff anyway
[06:36] rohitcolinrao: ok
[06:36] denysonique: and file a bug report that it causes you a weird placebo effect (;
[06:36] rohitcolinrao: i submitted an issue in github for jade
[06:37] rohitcolinrao: i'm hoping it's not something with expres
[06:37] rohitcolinrao: i doubt it tho
[06:37] rohitcolinrao: i think it's something with jade
[06:39] russfrank: rohitcolinrao: i'm not sure i understand your question
[06:39] russfrank: i can't actually help you because i'm dumb, but i'm still curious what issue you're having

[06:39] ryanrolds: When you 'diff' the outputs, nothing is different?
[06:40] rohitcolinrao: dammit
[06:40] rohitcolinrao: sorry one sec guys
[06:40] ryanrolds: Ok, I was going to say. That shouldn't happen.
[06:41] rohitcolinrao: alright, there's no difference in the markup, but i'm not able to replicate it now
[06:41] rohitcolinrao: it's rendering properly
[06:41] rohitcolinrao: only thing i can think of is that i didn't restart node after adding my css (shouldn't have to
[06:42] ryanrolds: :)
[06:42] rohitcolinrao: thanks for listening anyway
[06:42] rohitcolinrao: that was bizarre
[06:43] ryanrolds: No problem, it looked like the start of a good mystery.
[06:44] rohitcolinrao: yeah, i'll keep an eye out for it, i tried a bunch of stuff and it was basically phantom space being added to all four sides of a div.. on EVERY div

[16:33] confoocious has joined the channel
[16:35] warris has joined the channel
[16:36] ppcano: devaholic: it is not working. Currently, i am using nvm and i thought  the problem was because require is called from a script.
[16:37] devaholic: node -v
[16:37] JmZ: so i have an app which processes items in a queue (using async), processing an item involves passing a callback to yet another function call. items get inserted into the db. problem is, mongodb requires the connection to be closed manually otherwise it never exits (node never exits)
[16:37] devaholic: echo $PATH
[16:38] JmZ: how on earth am i supposed to be able to close the connection when everything has been processed? The number of items queued is dynamic, changes per run. The callbacks run in any order.
[16:39] ppcano: devaholic: it is using the nvm installed version. it was setup with ( nvm use default ), however packages seems not to be found
[16:39] JmZ: nobody replied the last 3 times i asked this so i assume nobody understands or has a clue 
[16:39] wtfizzle: There are tools to handle this logic for you (async, step, etc.)
[16:39] devaholic: !gh async.js
[16:39] devaholic: hmm
[16:39] devaholic: JmZ thats not very nice
[16:40] JmZ: wtfizzle are you talking to me? im using async, as i said.
[16:40] wtfizzle: The way I generally do it is I check the call count manually
[16:40] wtfizzle: Ah, sorry, I missed that
[16:40] wtfizzle: I don't have too much experience using async for this
[16:40] wtfizzle: I've always handled it manually
[16:40] devaholic: JmZ use async.anything and close the connection in the final callback
[16:40] JmZ: I use async's queue. i figured i could close the connection on the drain event, but the queue drains multiple times
[16:40] devaholic: simple as that
[16:40] JmZ: oh
[16:41] devaholic: series, parallel, auto, whatever
[16:41] wtfizzle: I just set a count limit to the total number of requests, and close the account when that number of callbacks is reached
[16:41] wtfizzle: close the connection*
[16:41] mAritz has joined the channel
[16:41] JmZ: devaholic: yeah thats a good idea, run all the main code in a callback inside a series call
[16:42] JmZ: then a separate one to close the db
[16:42] JmZ: devaholic: although, won't it claim to have finished when it really hasn't? because there will be callbacks waiting to execute
[16:43] devaholic: read async docs
[16:43] JmZ: devaholic: if the function you pass to async.series first, calls functions within its self which take callbacks
[16:43] JmZ: the parent function will complete before the callbacks
[16:43] devaholic: It doesnt matter, as long as you call the async callback eventually
[16:43] JmZ: so async.series will surely think it is done and close the db
[16:43] devaholic: no
[16:44] JmZ: as for saying read the async docs, i did. if it had an answer i wouldn't be here
[16:44] JmZ: i assumed it ran.. asynchronously, which would mean the function finishes before the callbacks inside it
[16:45] ppcano: devaholic: nvm problem, must setup with v0.4 ( export NODE_PATH="$NVM_DIR/$VERSION/lib/node_modules"
[16:45] ppcano: ), thanks for your help
[16:46] devaholic: JmZ: go implement async.parallel
[16:46] JmZ: that'd make no sense, it needs to be serial not parallel
[16:47] JmZ: why would you close the db connection.. while querying the db?
[16:47] devaholic: JmZ: if it doesnt work GIST your code, and ask nicely for help
[16:47] asoltys has joined the channel
[16:47] devaholic: you dont understand how async works

[16:47] EhevuTov has joined the channel
[16:47] JmZ: parallel runs the callbacks in parallel, clearly
[16:47] devaholic: ppcano: ?
[16:48] JmZ: running a callback to close the db connection in parallel to the main code.. really?
[16:48] JmZ: i understand it.
[16:48] devaholic: JmZ: the finally callback is run after everything is completed
[16:49] devaholic: ppcano: what is your actual path
[16:49] JmZ: devaholic: the 'finally callback'? you mean the final block? async has no 'finally callback'
[16:49] JmZ: in which case, no, it doesn't. it runs after the functions have completed, not the callbacks they initiate at a later stage
[16:50] devaholic: hope you are trolling me
[16:50] ppcano: devaholic: i need to setup the path, the problem is mentioned at https://github.com/creationix/nvm/issues/56

[17:01] JmZ: devaholic: https://gist.github.com/1461559
[17:01] JmZ: there you go
[17:01] JmZ: simple logic, the callback is executed once the request completes. the function calling request() completes way before that point though
[17:01] JmZ: making async.series of no use in this situation
[17:02] k1ttty has joined the channel
[17:02] devaholic: you arent using async.series properly
[17:02] devaholic: once sec
[17:02] devaholic: one
[17:03] JmZ: considering it is almost identical to the example given on async's github, i assumed it was valid

[17:04] TheJH: devaholic, you failed to spot the issue
[17:04] TheJH: devaholic, you rewrote it, but didn't fix it
[17:04] devaholic: all i did was add the callback
[17:04] TheJH: JmZ, call `c();` inside the requests callback
[17:05] TheJH: JmZ, not below it
[17:05] JmZ: ahh
[17:05] JmZ: sense, some has been made
[17:05] TheJH: JmZ, https://gist.github.com/1461580
[17:05] devaholic: thats also going to be necessary, good catch
[17:05] TheJH: devaholic, not "also"
[17:06] devaholic: ahem
[17:06] JmZ: TheJH: I see now, so the function is "completed" once the callback is called
[17:06] TheJH: devaholic, "series" is called "series" because it works in series, not parallel
[17:06] zivester has joined the channel
[17:06] TheJH: JmZ, yes, somewhat like that
[17:06] MacDiva has joined the channel
[17:07] JmZ: going to be pretty hard implementing it in my code though 
[17:07] devaholic: TheJH, I see what you are saying, but regardless of series or parallel or auto or anything, the final callback is what i was pointing JmZ towards, ofc you can also do it in a "final" callback in a series
[17:07] JmZ: since it'll be a queue running in a series
[17:07] devaholic: why am i explaining this...
[17:07] JmZ: calling callbacks 
[17:08] konobi: think of it as an exception handler

[17:12] JmZ: yeah i simplified the explanation

[17:12] TheJH: JmZ, mmmhm... do you know streamlinejs? although you should NOT use it if you don't know flow control, it's quite useful
[17:12] konobi: paralell([ <func1>, <func2> ], <func_afterwards>)
[17:12] JmZ: i do know flow control
[17:12] JmZ: parallel*
[17:12] devaholic: isnt streamline like fibers?
[17:13] JmZ: yep konobi that wouldn't work for this case
[17:13] TheJH: devaholic, no, streamline is a precompiler, and it has explicit markers for "pausing" execution
[17:13] JmZ: i'd explain but it'll take too long
[17:13] TheJH: JmZ, alternatively, if you like coffeescript or so, try coco, it has a backcall feature that allows you to "pause" execution, too
[17:13] devaholic: yeah... i saw it on github once... that stuff seems trollish tbh
[17:13] TheJH: ("pause" as in "wait for a callback")
[17:14] JmZ: i don't need to pause execution
[17:14] JmZ: ah
[17:14] TheJH: JmZ, it doesn't really pause
[17:14] JmZ: yeah ill figure it out with async
[17:14] JmZ: i don't need anything else
[17:14] TheJH: JmZ, it can't even do that

[17:14] JmZ: good to know
[17:14] JmZ: lol
[17:17] JmZ: basically, i have a function which reads some file, inserts each item into a queue, the queue callback request()'s each item's URL and does something in request's callback
[17:18] JmZ: so getting all that to run in a series...

[20:05] AndreasMadsen: idefine: I might not be back then, but yes the current native cluster module do support that, however there is almost no reason to use it, you should use child_process.fork. But in native cluster 2 there will be a listening in the master, there will emit when a given server is listening in the worker. I have to make sure not to rely on that event since there might not be a server in the worker.

[22:13] Vekz: thx
[22:14] moogoo: I think at least...
[22:14] matti: Vekz: What about ncurses? Can you use it in your case?

[22:15] tdubz has joined the channel
[22:15] moogoo: ncruses seems a bit heavy for just clearing a screen

[22:16] brainproxy: recommendations for simple node.js tool/lib that will listen for post receive hook from github and issue a git pull? 
[22:17] moogoo: but on the otherhand, you can hook up a teletype machine to your nix box ez

[22:17] gsmcwhirter: brainproxy: strangely enough I have been working on something like that for the last couple days as a part of another project. Nowhere near usable yet though =(
[22:17] paq has joined the channel
[22:17] vnguyen: for the new node.js core cluster module, is there a way to bind diff variables to each fork?
[22:17] gsmcwhirter: though I also didn't look very hard for an existing solution, so something may exist that is usable

[22:35] JmZ: -.-
[22:35] JmZ: mongode, mongodb-native, etc
[22:35] shedinja: JmZ: because it needs to keep the connection to the db opened, most databases are like that
[22:35] JmZ: its a wrapper around mongodb-native fyi
[22:35] vicapow: it's been really hard to find an example in node source or docs
[22:35] isaacsanders has joined the channel

[22:38] insin: .on('ALLthethings', function() { })
[22:38] JmZ: it could execute in any order, not predefined
[22:39] JmZ: even if i keep a count of how many have completed, there's no predetermined number of 'tasks' to reach
[22:40] JmZ: the app works perfect without mongodb, i just need it to close when everything else has finished
[22:40] co_dh has joined the channel
[22:40] shedinja: JmZ: is there a way to tell when a queue has finished?
[22:41] JmZ: using async.queue, no. it could drain multiple times and often does
[22:41] JmZ: meaning it becomes empty, then further items are added
[22:41] JmZ: i can see this requiring some major code changes just to close a silly db connection

[22:42] prettyrobots has joined the channel
[22:42] asoltys has joined the channel
[22:44] shedinja: JmZ: ah. a dirty way to do it would be to set a timeout if you expect workers in the queue to each take a certain time to finish
[22:44] JmZ: one thing i don't understand is..
[22:44] JmZ: mongodb-native requires that you close the connection to finish execution. mongode is a wrapper around mongodb-native, but the examples don't close the connection
[22:45] JmZ: and it appears mongode has no close method, but it just remains "running" forever
[22:45] JmZ: if i put it back to using mongodb-native alone, not the mongode wrapper, it has the same issue if i don't close it
[22:46] coreb: npm ls shows what modules are installed, but how do I get npm to automatically update the package.json file with those deps?
[22:47] shedinja: JmZ: another inefficient way would be to open the mongodb connection each time you want to query the db and then close it when it responds
[22:47] JmZ: yeah i really don't want to do that

[23:23] marcello3d: how does that work with the 'g' flag?
[23:23] marcello3d: when you call exec multiple times
[23:24] marcello3d: I guess it just resets when you hit the end of it
[23:24] isaacsanders: can you explain marcello3d

[23:39] aroman: any tools for doing HTML parsing in Node?
[23:39] Aria: Heh. Yes.
[23:39] aroman: something like BeautifulSoup, except in Node.
[23:39] Aria: I wrote https://github.com/aredridel/html5/
[23:39] aroman: O____O
[23:39] Aria: It's relatively complete and mostly un-crashy. And does the full HTML5 parsing spec, at least as much as was defined when I wrote it.
[23:39] yorick: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules#wiki-parsers-other <-- probably
[23:40] aroman: Aria: this does look really awesome but, a few questions"
[23:40] aroman: *:
[23:40] Aria: There's a faster parser, too, called htmlparser, but it parses bad HTML poorly.
[23:40] isaacsanders: RE: testanything.org W00T perl!
[23:40] aroman: So does it really only work with HTML5? :P I'm going to be feeding it some really shitty-tasting HTML4 that is likely not very compliant.
[23:41] aroman: but as you said 'the browser makes sense of it'.
[23:41] Aria: HTML5 is a much more tolerant parser.
[23:41] aroman: I'm currently doing this parsing in Python w/ BeautifulSoup, but it's a _massive_ PITA to get Node to talk with Python properly.
[23:41] Aria: It should do fine. I've found a few edge cases I don't yet handle, but it works.
[23:42] Aria: Heh. To talk to python, open a socket and push json back and forth.
[23:42] aroman: i'm using zeromq with a haphazard async rpc pattern atm, which is giving me all sorts of headaches.

[23:42] Sample has joined the channel
[23:42] aroman: Aria: eh?
[23:42] aroman: that's basically what I'm doing, but with ZeroMQ sockets. The trick is making it async
[23:42] Aria: Hehe. On the python side, yes.
[23:42] yorick: aroman: but is it async?
[23:42] Aria: (I might just hack it and use a thread + queue.)
[23:42] yorick: hrm
[23:42] jaitaiwan has joined the channel
[23:42] aroman: yorick: my poor implementation is, yeah.
[23:42] aroman: but it's bad.
[23:43] yorick: Aria: but is it async
[23:43] Aria: Which?
[23:43] aroman: I really want to use socketio RPC as here: http://alogicalparadox.com/backbone.iobind/
[23:43] yorick: the html5 parser
[23:43] Aria: The parser? Yes it is.
[23:43] yorick: aroman: heh, tab-fail :)
[23:43] aroman: yorick: oh derp xD
[23:43] Aria: Well, synchronous, but partial. So you can hand it chunks as they arrive and it'll add them to the DOM
[23:43] aroman: anyhow html5 looks pretty delicious
[23:43] yorick: I seem to be unable to tab-complete to Aria
[23:44] Aria: It's good. Patches welcome, of course, but it's getting there, and quite usable already. Speed's my next focus.
[23:44] yorick: Aria: why are you not in my nick-list?
[23:44] aroman: okay next question, async http requests?
[23:44] yorick: teach me your dark magic.
[23:45] isaacsanders: vows looks like the best to me...
[23:45] Lingerance: yorick: I see them in the list.
[23:46] Aria: yorick: bug in your IRC client?
[23:46] Aria: aroman: Async http requests? request, or node's built in http client. No magic needed there.
