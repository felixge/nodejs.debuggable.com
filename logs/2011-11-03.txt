[00:05] Kage: Socket.io.js?
[00:05] TooTallNate: Kage: i'd guess by starting an http server and talking to it
[00:05] TooTallNate: if the project uses socket.io then it uses that for communication

[01:48] secoif: what kind of game?
[01:49] Kage: secoif: MMORPG.. I need tile support, and lots more...
[01:49] secoif: yeah i don't know if there's anything like that for node
[01:50] Kage: I think I need to make html5 graphics engine first
[01:50] secoif: Kage http://toolbox.no.de/search?q=game
[01:50] secoif: That's little to do with node
[01:51] secoif: you might want to check out ocanvas, it's got a pretty sweet sprite sheet system for animations http://ocanvas.org/
[01:52] secoif: coming from a flash background, it made canvas a lot more familiar 
[01:53] Kage: secoif: it seems Javascript is full of tons of frameworks that are great if you want a simple game up and running in like 2 minutes, but for a larger project they all far apart
[01:54] secoif: Kage it's the same in Flash. If you want something decent for your needs you usually have to build your own
[01:54] Kage: secoif: I love dissecting demos and thinking I understand all the methods of a class, then I go to another file and see new methods that are defined outside of the class' file
[01:55] secoif: Kage that's usually a good thing.
[01:55] Kage: secoif: no its not... everything associated with a class should be defined, or documented in one place
[01:56] Kage: secoif: I am getting sick of seeing a class defined half way in one file, and the other half across 10 other files
[01:56] Kage: its so annoying that I can't figure out what is going on cause I have to keep changing files to see what everything does

[01:58] Kage: secoif: no, but all of the class is defined in one file
[01:59] devongovett has joined the channel
[01:59] Kage: so when I see something is of type "Player", I can go to the player file and see all the methods and properties it has
[01:59] Kage: I hate loose typing
[01:59] Aria: So why develop in a language like JS?
[01:59] secoif: again, sounds like you'd be happier over in Flash
[02:00] Aria: JS takes a different kind of discipline.
[02:00] Aria: It's hard to port thinking from C++ to JS
[02:00] Kage: Aria: because these days expect games they can play without downloading
[02:00] Aria: So flash?
[02:00] Kage: people expect*
[02:00] Aria: Compile C++ or Java to JS?
[02:00] secoif: Kage: unity
[02:00] Aria: Clojure? Haxe?
[02:01] Kage: secoif: unity needs downloads to aid a webbrowser
[02:01] secoif: not if you target flash player
[02:01] Kage: well I only have Linux system, and I don't think there is a flash IDE for Linux
[02:02] secoif: vim + the flex compiler
[02:02] harthur has joined the channel
[02:02] Aria: What secoif said.
[02:02] Aria: You don't need an IDE for flash. You do for animations authoriing, but for a game, it'll only get in your way.
[02:02] Aria: In fact, the Flash IDE is a steaming pile of hacked-up eclipse.
[02:02] Aria: It's slow AND broken!
[02:03] secoif: Kage plus, if you need an IDE, http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#linux is a better choice
[02:04] Kage: so you are suggesting Java applets?
[02:04] Aria: No, Flash ones
[02:05] secoif: no, intellij is an actionscript/flex ide on par/better than flash builder
[02:05] Aria: People have Flash. Java's a download ;-)

[02:05] secoif: flash also good since you can now target ios and android
[02:06] toki_kanno has joined the channel
[02:07] secoif: haxe also good option there too. If you really hate javascript you don't have to use it. It's probably not quite ready as a games platform anyway due to IE's canvas support
[02:07] Kage: honestly, I hate flash... I want HTML5 to replace that proprietary crap...   but... but meh
[02:08] secoif: html5 has nothing to do with flash.
[02:08] secoif: 90% of crossover is misuse
[02:08] Kage: secoif: I don't hate javascript, I hate crappy frameworks people have built on it
[02:08] francisl has joined the channel
[02:08] secoif: Kage it's just different thinking.

[02:09] Kage: secoif: I actually used Javascript before anything else, but I haven't used it in like... 5 years until a few weeks ago
[02:09] Aria: It's just not going to be organized like C++
[02:10] Aria: It's functional, it's prototypical, and it's differently typed.
[02:10] Me1000 has joined the channel
[02:10] Aria: ActionScript in Flash would probably suit you well: It's javascript like in some pleasant ways, and C++ like in some pleasant ways.
[02:11] Kage: Aria, well lots of the concepts seem the same as lua, and I LOVE lua
[02:11] tomlion_ has joined the channel

[10:00] zomg: m4rcs: perhaps you need to read more on how scoping, closures and this works :)
[10:00] zomg: I seem to be using a lot of somefun.bind(this) though. Can't use that in browser JS so much since they don't support bind in functions yet
[10:01] m4rcs: any suggestions for a good tutorial on this?
[10:01] Lingerance: But you'll be wanting to use bind: boxcar.sendNotification.bind(boxcar) (pass that instead of boxcar.sendNotification; note bind() returns a function)

[14:41] boltR has joined the channel
[14:42] lmatteis: garrensmith: this is a little confusing, i'm using the request() function to run a simple request and get the response back, so it's a method. while that api page shows that request is an object with the method 'setEncoding'.
[14:42] lmatteis: garrensmith: i'm using var request = require('request');
[14:42] garrensmith: lmatteis: is require the built in request supported by nodejs or 3rd party library?

[15:04] lmatteis: without the -?
[15:05] garrensmith: lmatteis: or utf16 else the data you getting is weird
[15:05] lmatteis: tried with encoding: "utf-8", with "utf8"

[15:15] lmatteis: it's a simple html page
[15:15] garrensmith: lmatteis: I think this line is wrong https://github.com/mikeal/request/blob/master/main.js#L345

[15:20] mafintosh: IonEarth: Could you share the example?
[15:21] IonEarth: headers are: {"server":"nginx/0.6.33","date":"Thu, 03 Nov 2011 15:20:32 GMT","content-type":"text/html","transfer-encoding":"chunked","connection":"close"}

[15:36] devdazed: IonEarth: probably should return application/javascript
[15:36] IonEarth: i have tried it with text/html, text/json, application/json and they all work
[15:36] devdazed: or json
[15:36] IonEarth: but i will need to open this api up at some point, and what do peeps expect?  i saw that like flickr api is just text/html
[15:37] IonEarth: i like to do things as "right" as possible...
[15:37] devdazed: depends on how its accessed.  json if it will be accessed like this but if it will be used client side, with a callback then application/javascript is best

[16:42] mmalecki: hdf: it's a work in progress, iirc
[16:43] bnoordhuis: joshkehn: right (stupid font)

[17:33] bnoordhuis: and apparently also across linux versions :)
[17:33] Harzilein: does search.npmjs.org have a way to specify a search with a fragment?

[17:33] wankdanker: bnoordhuis: ahh. ha!
[17:34] IonEarth: Hi everyone, I have a problem with some JSON i'm requesting from my Python API - it's returning the JSON fine, but it only writes a portion of it.  Is there a timeout or something that I am missing?  I have examples and links to my json api and my node.js client page...
[17:34] bnoordhuis: wankdanker: i discussed it with piscisaureus - iirc it depends on the windows version
[17:34] bnoordhuis: ACTION digs through his log files
[17:34] wankdanker: bnoordhuis: hmm. that sucks. what do you think about exposing setsockopt? 
[17:35] baudehlo: ACTION would love setsockopt or fcntl exposed
[17:35] wankdanker: bnoordhuis: cuz at least if that was exposed then the user could set options for their environment?

[17:37] albertosh has joined the channel
[17:37] baudehlo: it reminds me of Java.
[17:37] wankdanker: bnoordhuis: what if a subset of the options were exposed in a way that would make them work portably?
[17:38] bnoordhuis: baudehlo: java created more jobs than anything else in this industry
[17:38] wankdanker: bnoordhuis: ie; whatever options could be portable, allow those to be used

[17:39] passionke has joined the channel
[17:40] wankdanker: bnoordhuis: unfortunately a module i was working on depended on this behavior and without it, it's nearly useless beyond 4.12
[17:40] baudehlo: Java didn't suddenly create a load of tasks that required programming.
[17:40] agnat_ has joined the channel
[17:40] isaacs: "creating jobs" isn't what programming is for.
[17:40] isaacs: programming is to remove jobs.
[17:40] bnoordhuis: baudehlo: but it did give rise to concepts as the high-level (and high-earning) application architect
[17:41] isaacs: creating jobs means creating work.
[17:41] bnoordhuis: wankdanker: let's punt on it until after 0.6 is released
[17:41] mmalecki: isaacs++
[17:41] bnoordhuis: mmalecki: also, i'm a recovering enterprise java programmer
[17:41] Wizek has joined the channel
[17:41] isaacs: the greatest success of node will be if it makes each programmer more productive, meanign that you can do more with fewer of them.
[17:41] baudehlo: wankdanker: I had the same experience - the removal of a bunch of stuff made one of my modules never able to work on 0.5.
[17:41] rklancer: "Java didn't suddenly create a load of tasks that required programming": I thought that was what it was for???
[17:42] isaacs: wankdanker, baudehlo: what makes your modules "never able to work on 0.5"?
[17:42] rklancer: maybe it only seemed that way from the outside
[17:42] n8ji has left the channel
[17:42] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: sorry to hear that. also, java == enterprise, RIGHT?!
[17:42] baudehlo: isaacs: the removal of netbinding.pipe and passing fds to child processes.
[17:42] wankdanker: bnoordhuis: ok. 
[17:42] isaacs: oh, right
[17:42] baudehlo: (and yes I know netbinding.pipe wasn't really exposed)
[17:42] isaacs: yeah
[17:42] isaacs: and it wasn't ever going to be portable.
[17:43] isaacs: so, bubye
[17:43] wankdanker: isaacs: for me it's broadcast/multicast and binding behavior
[17:43] bnoordhuis: mmalecki: not quite - there is java and there is enterprise java and never the twain shall meet
[17:43] baudehlo: neither is qmail-queue
[17:43] baudehlo: some people need access to things that aren't portable.
[17:43] isaacs: it would be good to have a net-ext like the fs-ext, for stuff that is unix-only
[17:43] wankdanker: isaacs: see https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/1993
[17:43] baudehlo: isaacs: yeah that might be the only way to do it.
[17:43] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: haha, OK, so what's the difference?
[17:44] bnoordhuis: mmalecki: enterprise java is a jungle of lumbering over-designed frameworks
[17:44] bnoordhuis: it's been good for consultants though
[17:44] isaacs: baudehlo: while it's a little bit of a pita, i know, it's also really important that node-core be 100% consistent across all the platforms we support.
[17:44] baudehlo: I haven't had change to try it yet, but do C++ extensions compile under 0.4.x and 0.5.x the same?
[17:45] wankdanker: yeah, a net-ext would be nice.
[17:45] isaacs: ie, node-core's exposed/documented api, that is
[17:45] jxson has joined the channel

[17:49] olivier has joined the channel
[17:49] mmalecki: if you need 2 GB of memory you probably shouldn't use node in the first place
[17:50] devdazed: why is that?
[17:50] baudehlo: I hate that attitude :)
[17:50] baudehlo: we should be able to prototype any hugely memory consuming monster in node if we want to.
[17:51] mmalecki: tell me why you need 2 GB of memory and I will tell you why doing it in node is a bad idea
[17:51] baudehlo: Did you also think 640k would always be enough?
[17:51] devdazed: I'm using node and in one project it uses up to 8 gigs
[17:51] devdazed: i get past the memory issue by using a c module to store the data
[17:51] scott_gonzalez has joined the channel
[17:51] chrislorenz has joined the channel
[17:51] mmalecki: devdazed: and what makes node go to 8 gigs of memory usage?
[17:51] malkomalko has joined the channel
[17:52] benvie: media encoding would be my guess, or moving around a butt ton of data
[17:52] devdazed: for my particular use case, I need it to do real time decisioning of ads
[17:52] devdazed: and i have to repond in 50ms
[17:52] devdazed: so looping over a db is out of the question
[17:52] devdazed: plus we get requests in the hundreds per second
[17:53] mmalecki: benvie: media encoding is definitely not a job for node
[17:53] devdazed: so having everything in resident memory is a must
[17:53] baudehlo: mmalecki: I just hate arbitrary limits. Especially when OS's have so much more ram.
[17:53] mraleph: devdazed: if you have a good benchmark that demonstrates thrashing of the new GC you should submit it.

[17:53] baudehlo: Storing as a 2 level cache too is a good use case. Level 1 = ram, level 2 = redis/memcached, level 3 = go to the database.

[17:55] jerrysv: mraleph: no promises that it still compiles/runs under 0.5 though :)
[17:55] devdazed: mraleph: do a simple for loop that pushes on to an array, then do a --trace-gc
[17:55] devdazed: once it gets to about 2 gigs, the gc will pause for seconds at a time

[17:56] mmalecki: devdazed: btw, you might be better of clustering/using multiple servers
[17:56] mraleph: well. as I said... nothing will help you if you constantly allocate

[17:57] devdazed: mmalecki: clustering, yes, routing no
[17:57] mmalecki: devdazed: why not?
[17:57] mraleph: and it started pausing exactly because it approached the hard limit
[17:57] devdazed: all decision is real time. theres no way to know ahead of time which server has the contect
[17:57] fairwinds: isaacs: hi ya. I have a custom module i have installed globally from folder. This module is required by another custom module that I also attempting to install globally. The first module installs fine but emits 404 that it cannot find the first. npm -ls shows the first module installed with the correct version. There were no errors encountered with install of first global module.
[17:57] mmalecki: devdazed: not exactly what I mean
[17:57] mraleph: it was doing last resort GCs all the time to attempt to free some memory.
[17:58] mmalecki: devdazed: you could have multiple servers query the same db, etc.
[17:58] mraleph: and lastresort GCs are not incremental
[17:58] mraleph: they are completely done in one go.

[18:00] fairwinds: isaacs: not sure what the issue is - global is global is it not?

[18:22] devdazed: domino14: you can always contribute ;)

[18:22] prudhvi: is this a right place to ask about npm?
[18:22] isaacs: yes
[18:22] sarlalian: domino14: Node is still a relatively new platform, there are new versions every week or two, and things are moving quickly
[18:22] devdazed: i think the package.json should be pinned to specific versions and not just be >0.4

[18:28] mmalecki: bjhaid: most likely a C addon

[18:28] cgfuh has joined the channel
[18:28] prudhvi: devdazed: with node 0.5.10 amd mongoose@2.3.8. When i do something like Model.find({}, func(e,c){}); it gets stuck in an infinite loop

[18:30] bjhaid: mmalecki: thanks but do you have link you can direct me to, i aint too much of a C person
[18:30] magnetik: i'm using https.CreateServer.. ?
[18:30] isaiah_ has joined the channel
[18:30] devdazed: prudhvi: I'm not sure, i haven't seen that happen
[18:31] context: magnetik: i was asking. im unaware of the ability to change cert on an already established connection. but closing/starting a new conenction with cert required obviously gives them the opportunity to change the cert...
[18:32] magnetik: i'm not realy a TLS pro, but I don't think it's possible. 
[18:32] mmalecki: bjhaid: I have no idea if such module exists, sorry. I mentioned it because it's the only sane way to do that.
[18:32] mmalecki: or, maybe some streaming stuff.

[18:45] heavysixer has joined the channel
[18:45] isaacs: ryanrolds_w: socket.end() or socket.destroySoon()
[18:45] isaacs: ryanrolds: .end() says "i'm done over here, but if you have more data, then i'll keep taking it"
[18:45] mmalecki: (also know as half-close, iirc)
[18:45] isaacs: ryanrolds: destroySoon() says "I'm done" and then, as soon as that's said, it forcibly terminates the connection
[18:45] ryanrolds_w: Ok, doh. That makes sense. In my mind end == destroy. I'm a dunse.
[18:45] ryanrolds_w: *dunce
[18:45] joemccann has joined the channel
[18:46] isaacs: yeah, it's a confusing api.  we'll clean it up in 0.7/0.8
[18:46] joemccann: sup
[18:46] isaacs: so, destroySoon will turn into .close(), basically
[18:46] ryanrolds_w: It makes sense. I'm happy with with the API, just having a brain fart on this one thing.
[18:47] ryanrolds_w: Thanks isaacs.
[18:47] isaacs: and for most purposes, you'll use .end(), unless it's a duplex stream that you don't want to be half-open
[18:47] ryanrolds_w: If I'm using .pipe() that should be calling end automatically, correct?

[19:37] magnetik_: Wezll, even with a res.destroy(), the https server does not ask for a new certificate
[19:39] mmalecki: lauxley1: nope

[19:40] lauxley1: mmalecki: websockets use http right ?
[19:40] TheJH: lauxley, websockets or flash sockets

[19:41] TheJH: lauxley, websockets start like http, but then they do something else

[19:41] slickplaid: i think flash can open raw tcp sockets
[19:41] pickels has joined the channel
[19:41] necromancer: slickplaid: i think you're right because it can stream to FMS which is TCP i believe
[19:41] lauxley1: TheJH: im just wondering if its ok to send like 10 http requests / sec to a client
[19:42] necromancer: lauxley1: facebook does it ;)
[19:42] aslant: slickplaid is right: http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/net/Socket.html

[19:44] Marak: necromancer: fms you say?
[19:44] slickplaid: push notifications, or pushing anything to the client required code on the client to poll the server

[19:46] Marak: and some server-side actionscript
[19:46] necromancer: Marak: yeah i'm on a project right now where i have to record voice from the browser and mix it with a background track
[19:46] Marak: fuck server-side actionscript
[19:46] mattrobenolt: I'd like to see this get merged in before 0.6 is released.
[19:46] necromancer: server-side actionscript? damn..
[19:46] slickplaid: +1 to that marak
[19:46] necromancer: didn't even know that was possible
[19:46] Marak: ohh yeah
[19:46] Marak: isnt that how you script FMS? i might have been doing it wrong
[19:46] necromancer: i've never touched the actual FMS product, it costs too much
[19:47] necromancer: Red5, however, is configured with java
[19:47] Marak: i setup a basic auth and custom role system that integrated with some coldfusion stuff
[19:47] necromancer: something i haven't touched since AP computer science in high school...
[19:47] Marak: in server-side AS3
[19:47] necromancer: oh wow
[19:47] mmalecki: who the fuck does server-side AS3?
[19:47] mmalecki: who the fuck does AS3?
[19:47] slickplaid: who the fuck
[19:47] Marak: i cant even remember how it works, that code is long gone
[19:48] necromancer: mmalecki: easiest way to write an cross-platform mobile app imo
[19:48] Marak: managed all the sessions and connection logic for cameras and broadcasters and stuff
[19:48] necromancer: actually i think AS3 would be kinda nice on the server side because it would basically be javascript with classes and static typing
[19:48] mmalecki: mattrobenolt: lgtm
[19:48] mmalecki: necromancer: no. HTML5.
[19:48] Marak: necromancer: the way i was using it, it had no tools at all. i was writing code in text editor and restarting FMS
[19:48] Marak: necromancer this was a long time ago though
[19:48] mmalecki: mattrobenolt: any reason this isn't getting merged?

[19:50] necromancer: mmalecki: not yet. maybe when HTML5 apps are considered first-class citizens on iOS and Android...but right now they're still way slower than native apps
[19:50] slickplaid: me too, but I admit nothing
[19:50] mmalecki: mattrobenolt: +1'ed
[19:50] necromancer: AND they can't access camera/microphone, which Flash can
[19:50] necromancer: you can also design, build and compile a mobile app entirely from Flash
[19:50] mattrobenolt: mmalecki: Thank you sir. :)
[19:50] necromancer: that's pretty damn cool
[19:50] necromancer: definitely a reason to keep Flash around...
[19:51] mmalecki: meh. compare cpu usage when planing youtube video with flash and html5.
[19:51] slickplaid: has anyone developed a flash app that can pass user camera/mic to html5's video/audio yet?
[19:51] necromancer: mmalecki: i can't do that, iPhone doesn't let flash in Safari ;)

[19:52] tjholowaychuk: slickplaid we are
[19:52] necromancer: damn that would make this project so much easier...
[19:52] tjholowaychuk: but yeah we have to use flash
[19:52] slickplaid: tjholowaychuk: foserious?
[19:52] tjholowaychuk: because web tech sucks ass
[19:52] mmalecki: necromancer: I mean, browser.
[19:52] mmalecki: necromancer: on a desktop
[19:52] tjholowaychuk: most of it is canvas though
[19:52] slickplaid: tjholowaychuk: project page or still in dev?
[19:52] ali_and_ben: Does anyone have experience testing a rails 3.1 app with zombie.js? I'm running into a problem where browser.pressButton is not submitting the form
[19:52] necromancer: mmalecki: that's not what we're talking about here though, we're talking about mobile. flash is irrelevant for desktop unless you need cross-browser a/v playback
[19:52] mmalecki: (not like I'm hatin', even though I am)
[19:52] necromancer: and even then, you can use HTML5 when you can
[19:52] rendar: mmalecki: i guess flash uses a lot more cpu than html5, am i right?
[19:52] necromancer: oh yeah
[19:52] mmalecki: I'm just mad at people overusing flash
[19:53] necromancer: tons more
[19:53] mmalecki: rendar: yeah, it does
[19:53] slickplaid: i would use the shit out of that in this project i'm developing on
[19:53] necromancer: tjholowaychuk: is it open?

[19:53] tjholowaychuk: :D
[19:53] tjholowaychuk: haha
[19:53] slickplaid: i want a stand-in flash solution that can be switched out once html vid/aud user input gets formalized
[19:53] necromancer: rendar: the API is massive
[19:53] mmalecki: rendar: it's a shitty technology
[19:54] necromancer: and it's old
[19:54] mmalecki: + overhead of inserting one more runtime
[19:54] rendar: i agree..
[19:54] necromancer: it's basically a VM
[19:54] necromancer: kinda like JVM
[19:54] rendar: exactly
[19:54] Industrial: lua has a vm, im pretty happy with that.
[19:54] slickplaid: tjholowaychuk: you guys going to be selling it or have a timeline for when it'll be available?
[19:54] ppcano has joined the channel
[19:54] necromancer: except while Flash's platform design has stagnated, with Adobe instead focusing on how to make the program/API better, the Java platform has focused entirely on the PLATFORM and that's why you have shit like Groovy, Scala, etc. taking the place of java on its JVM platform
[19:54] blueadept`: could anyone here help me with the new require.paths move in 0.5? i have this code in a node module: http://pastie.org/private/gc3wwyyww4qktay4cjy8ma what can i change it to to work with 0.5?
[19:54] ali_and_ben has left the channel
[19:55] rendar: a friend of mine said that lua is one of the most fast scripting languages )
[19:55] rendar: :)
[19:55] Industrial: it is
[19:55] rendar: cool
[19:55] necromancer: but really, any time you have to create a damn VM you're adding a ton of overhead
[19:55] necromancer: that may or may not be necessary
[19:55] Industrial: luajit is made of win and love
[19:55] mmalecki: Scala is quite nice actually
[19:55] rendar: necromancer: +1'd
[19:55] necromancer: yeah the java platform rules
[19:55] mmalecki: Scala - JVM would be *such* a win
[19:55] franksalim: v8 is a vm
[19:55] garrensmith has joined the channel
[19:55] necromancer: java's a great idea, implemented poorly
[19:55] mmalecki: no, Java itself sucks
[19:55] necromancer: then saved by its platform
[19:55] mmalecki: I just like some of Scala features
[19:56] necromancer: mmalecki: i thought scala was in the JVM..
[19:56] Industrial: lua just cant get an ecosystem off the ground like ruby and node.. thats just too bad imgo
[19:56] mmalecki: necromancer: yes. that's why I've said that Scala - JVM would be an epic win
[19:56] Industrial: i prefer it to js..
[19:56] tjholowaychuk: Industrial yeah it's too bad
[19:56] tjholowaychuk: lua would be better in the browser
[19:56] necromancer: oh yeha
[19:57] rendar: Industrial: you mean that lua doesn't have libraries which let lua to grow?
[19:57] mmalecki: hm, this would be quite easy to implement.
[19:57] Industrial: its more the kind of people that use it
[19:57] Industrial: i.e. not the cool kids
[19:57] necromancer: mmalecki: i disagree with that somewhat, i feel like the JVM's come a long way and it can only get better. coupled with increased computing power and bandwidth...could be pretty damn cool to see what happens
[19:57] necromancer: although you may be trying to use Scala to accomplish some very low-level tasks for which i guess the JVM wouldn't make snese

[20:13] mmalecki: wankdanker: :). expect some code tomorrow or something like that, it's a busy week
[20:13] EyePulp: plus our potential market wouldn't install desktop clients, so we had to expose it all via web

[20:15] wankdanker: EyePulp: cool. makes sense. i suppose maybe using hook.io could allow using all sorts of clients. will investigate further when i get there.
[20:16] EyePulp: wankdanker: I'd do some searching, as there seem to be a ton of chat projects out there - you may not have to do as much work.
[20:17] wankdanker: EyePulp: yeah, i'll do that. it's not an immediate priority, but if there was already a solid project in node, i'd bump the priority.

[20:26] mmalecki: is there any reason one should connect to unix domain socket in order to check if this file name is available?
[20:26] tjholowaychuk: why not just stat?
[20:26] mmalecki: exactly
[20:26] mmalecki: this code: https://github.com/indexzero/node-portfinder/blob/master/lib/portfinder.js#L78 is why I ask
[20:27] tjholowaychuk: hm
[20:27] mattrobenolt: What's up with the new uses of "~"? I just happened to notice it on L96 of that file.
[20:27] tjholowaychuk: portfinder?
[20:27] mattrobenolt: I see it randomly, and I'm not sure exactly what the goal of it is.
[20:27] tjholowaychuk: why not just use ephemerial ports
[20:27] mmalecki: tjholowaychuk: it's about unix sockets here
[20:28] mmalecki: tjholowaychuk: so, like, to make sure that /tmp/forever.sock is not taken, etc.
[20:28] baudehlo: can't you connect to a unix socket and delete the file but still be connected? Maybe that's what it's trying to avoid.
[20:28] tjholowaychuk: right
[20:28] tjholowaychuk: so not a port
[20:28] mmalecki: baudehlo: yeah, that's what I'm wondering
[20:28] baudehlo: Though that shouldn't matter.
[20:28] jgallen23: can anybody recommend a good library for managing config files across dev/stage/prod?
[20:29] baudehlo: git?
[20:29] mmalecki: mattrobenolt: binary negation
[20:29] benvie: ls
[20:29] mattrobenolt: mmalecki: Yeah, I get it on the fundamental level. Just curious of the new found applications of it.
[20:29] mmalecki: mattrobenolt: -1 -> 0, in this case
[20:30] benvie: useful for indexOf
[20:30] mattrobenolt: But if it is found, −1 is yielded.
[20:30] benvie: !~
[20:31] mattrobenolt: Is there any benefit to doing that vs indexOf(x) != −1 ?
[20:31] mattrobenolt: Or just a style/cleanliness preference?
[20:31] mmalecki: mattrobenolt: no benefit, I think
[20:31] benvie: it may be faster in some contexts but it's not an optimization worth making for that reason
[20:31] mmalecki: and it isn't any cleaner
[20:31] mmalecki: so, well.
[20:32] benvie: it's easier for me to visually parse the meaning
[20:32] mattrobenolt: Yeah, I just have started seeing it in Node code. I don't see it used anywhere else.
[20:32] benvie: it very specifically applies to situations where the negative return is -1
[20:32] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[20:32] mattrobenolt: Gotcha. I see it used like:  ~~ too.
[20:32] benvie: which is not the norm for negative returns in js, but is used in some common functions
[20:33] mattrobenolt: And I found that that will enforce somethign to be an integer. At lesat that's how it seems.
[20:33] mattrobenolt: Like:  ~~options.port
[20:33] mattrobenolt: If it's a string that doesn't convert, it casts to 0.
[20:33] joshkehn has joined the channel
[20:33] mattrobenolt: Instead of erroring.
[20:34] joshkehn has left the channel
[20:34] benvie: yeah it forces to integer, floors, and sets non-integers to 0
[20:34] benvie: in one fell swoop
[20:34] benvie: er
[20:34] benvie: non numbers
[20:34] benvie: while leaving integers unchanged
[20:34] benvie: pretty useful
[20:34] mattrobenolt: Nice. It's just an interesting use case. For example, it's not in the entire jQuery source code. I've only ever come across uses in Node code/libraries.
[20:35] joshkehn has joined the channel
[20:35] joshkehn has left the channel
[20:35] benvie: it's funny too because you usually see the shortcuts much less so in Node code
[20:35] mattrobenolt: Yeah.
[20:35] benvie: due to space not being the same factor
[20:35] willwhite has joined the channel
[20:35] benvie: and generally better coding also
[20:35] mattrobenolt: indexOf is used quite a bit throughout jQuery. "indexOf(x) >= 0"
[20:36] rklancer has joined the channel
[20:36] tjholowaychuk: i wouldnt look to jquery for styling
[20:36] domino14 has joined the channel
[20:36] benvie: yeah and in this shortcut's case I much prefer to forced front !~ for multiple reasons
[20:36] mmalecki: well, I've seen indexOf(x) == 3 once.
[20:36] mmalecki: not in jquery code, just some front-end js.
[20:37] mattrobenolt: tjholowaychuk: Not really using it as a styling reference, just reinforcing that I haven't seen that style anywhere except Node. No client side JS or any other languages I've used.

[20:37] tjholowaychuk: mattrobenolt ah
[20:38] mattrobenolt: I was confused a bit on it's meaning, actually, haha, I know it's a binary operator, but I've seen it used in weird ways not dealign with numbers. Especially since js is more flexible with types. Like, using: ~~'80'
[20:38] tjholowaychuk: in ruby it just throws
[20:39] tjholowaychuk: NoMethodError: undefined method `~' for 14.5:Float
[20:39] benvie: this is where I first saw it used http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/js-logic.htm#OO
[20:39] mattrobenolt: Yeah, Python throws too.
[20:39] mattrobenolt: TypeError: bad operand type for unary ~: 'str'
[20:39] benvie: and yeah I don't recall seeing it much or at all outside node
[20:39] tjholowaychuk: you wouldnt see it much if we had richer methods
[20:40] tjholowaychuk: foo.includes(bar)
[20:40] tjholowaychuk: etc
[20:40] tjholowaychuk: oh well
[20:40] mmalecki: tjholowaychuk++
[20:40] mattrobenolt: Right. I just never typically think of Node code needing to "compress" their code as much as possible. I'd expect it more in front end code.
[20:40] franciscallo has joined the channel
[20:40] benvie: I understand peoples' aversion to modifying prototypes but that's honestly not a valid concern on Node and and it's can be controlled in the bropwser
[20:40] mattrobenolt: Not that I'm complaining at all. It's just interesting.
[20:41] tjholowaychuk: mattrobenolt for sure, it's pretty useful though like if you have a percentage that you want to console.log() or something just throw a | 0 in there to floor it
[20:41] benvie: or at the very last, I'm using this in pretty much everything now https://github.com/medikoo/es5-ext
[20:41] simenbrekken has joined the channel
[20:42] benvie: which gets around the native prototype issue
[20:42] mattrobenolt: Yeah, the | doesn't really work in anythign outside JS either, haha
[20:42] mattrobenolt: Well, for flooring.
[20:42] tjholowaychuk: sure, but it's there so it's nice to use
[20:42] mmalecki: ok, I'm refactoring this node-portfinder

[20:50] benvie: but that's a little more than just regular rpc

[20:51] coreb: hook.io looks huge, with a lot of dependencies
[20:51] coreb: dnode being one of them
[20:51] benvie: you basically take every method in a browser and every propeerty accessor and wrap them as asynchronnous if that would not be ridiculous to work with
[20:51] domino14 has joined the channel
[20:52] mmalecki: benvie: sure it is. but when you actually look at it, it's just a tiny wrapper around dnode

[20:53] coreb: mmalecki: sure, but if not nowjs, I guess dnode would suffice

[20:54] tjholowaychuk: i dont really get what nowjs does
[20:54] benvie: the whole structure is there, all the prototype chains and whatnot, so there's some room for minimizing the need to go to the browser but of course you have to to actually affect change in the browser

[20:58] mmalecki: what was the command to run node with debugging, but break at the first line of code?
[20:59] mmalecki: so, like, nothing gets run until you explicitely start it?
[20:59] tjholowaychuk: i think --debug-brk
[20:59] tjholowaychuk: cant remember
[20:59] tjholowaychuk: node --help sucks
[21:00] benvie: node --v8flags has it somewhere deep inside
[21:00] benvie: er --v8-options
[21:00] mmalecki: tjholowaychuk: seems to work, kinda. I will look into it, thanks
[21:01] mattrobenolt: So, I keep coming across the problem of needing to combine Buffer objects into one large Buffer. Would it make sense to allow the Buffer class to be able to handle 'data' events and 'end' events itself and be able to return a joined buffer?
[21:01] mattrobenolt: I've seen this done a few places already in Node with a repetitive task of looping over an array of Buffers and copying it's contents into a large "final" buffer.
[21:02] benvie: node --expose_natives_as="__natives__" is fun

[21:12] mattrobenolt: I see this pattern repeated a few places in Node and think it might make sense to extrapolate into another class that just handles a stream of buffers to combine into a large buffer.

[21:12] domino14: hey guys
[21:12] devdazed: mattrobenolt: have you seen https://github.com/bnoordhuis/node-buffertools
[21:12] domino14: how come i have to install packages with npm for every new folder?
[21:12] domino14: it seems that it doesnt read my global npm packages but it needs new ones for every folder with js files in it
[21:13] mattrobenolt: devdazed: No, but something like that would be really useful to have in Node core. At least a concat method.
[21:13] mashed-deux has joined the channel
[21:13] devdazed: mattrobenolt: there is buffer.copy
[21:13] smtlaissezfaire: tjholowaychuk: Is there no way to run a setTimeout when a worker receives a SIGQUIT in cluster.js?
[21:14] isaacs_: domino14: run `npm faq` and read it
[21:14] devdazed: you create a new buffer with the size of buffer a and b and copy those into it
[21:14] koffsyrup has joined the channel
[21:14] mattrobenolt: Right, but it requires a tedious loop over each buffer and combines them. I'm only bringing it up because I know this is used when reading a file from disk and now in my pull request for zlib. It's a bunch of repetitive code.
[21:14] devdazed: but buffer tools would be much faster as it is native
[21:15] domino14: oh, so it's kind of like a python virtualenv philosophy?
[21:15] domino14: i can dig that
[21:15] mattrobenolt: devdazed: I think it's beneficial to have something as a helper inside Node core becuase inside core itself, it's repeated often enough.
[21:16] isaacs_: mattrobenolt: yah, i think it'd be good to add a Buffer.flatten or something
[21:16] zpao: Jho_: that's because 0.4.12 (brew update for newer definitions) is the latest stable. 0.5 isn't a stable branch. if you want 0.5, download & build it yourself
[21:16] Jho_: ok thanks
[21:16] mattrobenolt: isaacs_: Yeah, for an array of Buffers that we get back from a 'data' event for example. ;)

[21:16] Jho_: also, thanks for the explanation :)

[21:17] zpao: Jho_: no problem

[21:17] EyePulp: Jho_: 0.4.12 is where a number of folks have stopped updating (from what I gather) until 0.5.x stabilizes more.
[21:18] EyePulp: I could be mistaken, but that's the impression I have
[21:18] devdazed: mattrobenolt: i like it
[21:18] mattrobenolt: It came from a need of gzipping and base64 encoding data in Python and needing to read it in Node.
[21:19] koffsyrup has joined the channel
[21:20] mattrobenolt: Converting a string to a compressed buffer is a relatively common thing to do. Especially for transmitting a large block of text over HTTP or some non-binary socket.
[21:20] devdazed: mattrobenolt: look in my project. i created a class called StreamCollector that does what you did for zlib in that commit, but for any stream
[21:21] mattrobenolt: Yeah, I was looking through that now.

[21:22] devdazed: PuffTheMagic: it was some spammer
[21:22] devdazed: got all of us
[21:22] mattrobenolt: devdazed: Same concept. But yeah, the StreamCollector is nice. I didn't put forth the effort to extrapolate a class just for use inside the zlib library.

[21:22] PuffTheMagic: figured that was all it was
[21:23] devdazed: mattrobenolt: i agree, i think nodes stream should have a "collect" type method
[21:23] isaacs_: mattrobenolt: for your patch, you could have a Buffer.copy loop
[21:23] isaacs_: mattrobenolt: it's not so terrible
[21:23] mattrobenolt: Or as isaacs_ said, a simple Buffer.flatter or whatever would be nice.
[21:23] EyePulp: isaacs_: ah - well I'm a dummy then.  Is it still considered unstable though?
[21:24] isaacs_: EyePulp: technically, yes, since the api may change a little bit.
[21:24] isaacs_: but not much

[21:24] tomyan has joined the channel
[21:24] devdazed: i see
[21:24] isaacs_: and allocating a new buffer on every write
[21:24] mattrobenolt: isaacs_: Are you referring to my update to the patch?
[21:25] isaacs_: imagine getting 1000 writes of 10 bytes each.  that's a 10 byte buffer, plus a 20 byte buffer + 30byte, ...
[21:25] isaacs_: mattrobenolt: nono
[21:25] devdazed: how would you do it then?
[21:25] jhurliman has joined the channel
[21:25] devdazed: maybe push them onto an array?
[21:25] devdazed: and flush periodically?
[21:26] mattrobenolt: devdazed: Push each buffer into an array of chunks as they come in, then combine them all on 'end'.
[21:26] devdazed: mattrobenolt: that seems better.
[21:26] isaacs_: devdazed: StreamCollector.prototype.write = function (c) { this._chunks.push(c); this._len += c.length }; StreamCollector.prototype.end = function () { var out = new Buffer(this._len), i = 0; this._chunks.forEach(function (c) { c.copy(out, i); i += c.length; }); this.emit("data", out) }

[22:00] mattrobenolt: What I'm using was stripped out of what was already used in Node for reading a file from disk.

[22:15] domino14: i have a django server and i want to implement some real-time stuff with node.js and socket.io.  when socket.io connects to the node server, i can pass the user's id but obviously this can be spoofed. how can i connect django's auth system to allow me to do this?
[22:16] Aria: Have your node script call out to django, or read django's data store.
[22:16] Aria: There's no magic to it, but it doesn't have to be complex.
[22:16] koffsyrup has joined the channel
[22:16] Aria: Better to pass a high-entropy token than a spoofable, guessable ID
[22:17] domino14: so django would generate a token for the user, and then the user would send it back thru socket.io to node, and node would compare?

[22:18] enmand has joined the channel
[22:18] Aria: Grab 128 bits of entropy from /dev/urandom or so, and then turn it into hex digits or base64 for transmission?
[22:18] mattrobenolt: domino14: A safe easy way to do it is sign your values.
[22:18] mmalecki has joined the channel
[22:18] Aria: Signing is good too, if you're going keyed infrastructure rather than magic token.
[22:18] domino14: unfortunately not quite sure what signing entails
[22:18] mattrobenolt: Like with an hmac algorithm to generate a signature with a private key. That's how lots of services work.
[22:19] mattrobenolt: Basically, you have a secret key that your server has that you keep private.
[22:19] Aria: (shared between django and node though)
[22:19] Sorella has joined the channel
[22:19] domino14: aha
[22:19] mattrobenolt: Say the user id is 1. You'll create an HMAC md5 hash with the secret key, then give that signature back as well.
[22:20] Aria: You do a hmac of the key + userid, and send the userid and the hashed copy to the client, that passes it to node.
[22:20] Aria: Node can compare the hash to the supplied userid + its key.
[22:20] mattrobenolt: The signature comes through the request, then on Node's side, you'll run an hmac on the user id again with the secret to make sure it matches.
[22:20] Aria: (that's a great solution for when node and django can't directly communicate, be it for complexity or other reasons)
[22:20] mattrobenolt: Thta's what Amazon S3 does for example when you use private urls and it has a Signature=XXX or wahtever. That signature is just signing the request variables to make sure they're not tampered with.
[22:21] mattrobenolt: Yep Aria, that's actually exactly what we're doing in an implementation.
[22:21] domino14: when you say "give that signature back" — which is the signature?
[22:21] Aria: Yeah. It's a good technique. And easy if you keep your data that you sign simple.
[22:21] hugodias has joined the channel
[22:21] mattrobenolt: We use Django's session id and a signed session id to pass through Node.
[22:21] domino14: the md5 hash for the secret key + user id ?
[22:21] koffsyrup has joined the channel
[22:21] Aria: Yeah.
[22:21] mattrobenolt: domino14: One second, I'll give you some Python code.
[22:21] Aria: You do want to HMAC, rather than just appending the key and userid together, though.
[22:22] Aria: There's some clever attacks that that prevents.
[22:22] domino14: thank you
[22:22] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[22:22] mattrobenolt: You DO NOT want to send out the key.
[22:22] mattrobenolt: That is private.
[22:22] mattrobenolt: https://github.com/mattrobenolt/django-snippets/blob/master/crypto.py
[22:22] Aria: Yeah.
[22:22] mattrobenolt: I have a little basic signature crypt module I use.
[22:23] Aria: The key can be any old random data for this, too. No need for expensive things like primes that are used in public/private keys.
[22:23] maushu: Marak, how did you decide to isolate your users in nodejitsu?
[22:23] mattrobenolt: You can just call:  signed = sign_value(user_id)
[22:23] mattrobenolt: It defaults to Django's SECRET_KEY
[22:23] alexdoom has joined the channel
[22:24] domino14: but the user id is still plain text in the signature ?
[22:24] Aria: Yeah.
[22:24] Aria: You have to give it to node somehow.
[22:24] domino14: ok - yes
[22:24] Aria: This just gives it a way to make sure it's the right one.
[22:24] eyeOfKdng has joined the channel
[22:24] Aria: (now: this means that anyone can use anyone else's hash to authenticate.)
[22:24] Aria: (And they don't expire short of rotating keys)
[22:25] mattrobenolt: Then in node, I do this: https://gist.github.com/1338095

[22:25] tauren has joined the channel
[22:25] Aria: (So that signed blob is now private data)
[22:25] mattrobenolt: Right, the data is plain text. A user id isn't necessarily secret. But this signature makes sure it wasn't tampered with anything except your server.
[22:25] domino14: mattrobenolt: awesome. what modules are required? hmac, crypto ?
[22:25] mattrobenolt: If someone tries to forge a request, it won't validate.
[22:26] domino14: mattrobenolt: i mean for the node side
[22:26] isaacs: SubStack: hey, what does mkdirp do when you tell it to create a path that already exists?
[22:26] OneOfOne has joined the channel
[22:26] mattrobenolt: Just crypto for Node.
[22:26] domino14: awesome , thanks so much
[22:26] mattrobenolt: In Django, it's returning a value of:  {{ value }}:{{ signature }}
[22:26] isaacs: SubStack: does it set the mode?  like, if there's a 0700 dir, and i do mkdirp("/that/dir", 0755, cb) will it chmod it?
[22:26] mattrobenolt: So like: 1:jkfdsajfhjdasjfas
[22:26] koffsyrup has joined the channel
[22:27] eb4890 has joined the channel
[22:27] mattrobenolt: In Node, you'll want to split it on the : to get the parts.
[22:27] SubStack: isaacs: pretty sure it just calls the callback if everything already exists
[22:27] isaacs: SubStack: ok, that's cool
[22:27] mattrobenolt: Actually, sorry, I got that backwards.  {{ signature }}:{{ value }}
[22:27] joshgillies has joined the channel
[22:27] snkcld has joined the channel
[22:27] isaacs: SubStack: in part of this tar thingie, i'm also making a long slog towards reusing everything possible.
[22:27] mattrobenolt: Also, as a fun plus, my Django library will pickle and base64 a non-string value.
[22:28] mattrobenolt: So you could sign a whole object if you wanted. But Node isn't going to be able to read it.
[22:28] mattrobenolt: Just FYI. So make sure you pass in your value as a string. Not an interger or long.
[22:28] jsurfer has joined the channel
[22:28] isaacs: SubStack: so, i'll just do fstream.Writer({ path: "/path/to/blah", type: "File", mode: 0755 }) and use mkdirp under the covers to make /path/to if it's missing.
[22:28] mattrobenolt: str(user.pk)
[22:28] SubStack: rock
[22:28] jimt has joined the channel
[22:28] isaacs: SubStack: what if it exists, but isn't a dir?
[22:28] isaacs: SubStack: will that clobber, or error, you think?
[22:28] isaacs: (rare edge case, but still)
[22:29] SubStack: well it only checks for EEXIST
[22:29] isaacs: like, if you do mkdirp("/path/to/thing/that/isnt/a/dir/then/some/more/stuff"...
[22:29] isaacs: where /path/to/thing/that/isnt/a/dir is a file
[22:29] SubStack: so you'll get an error in the callback
[22:30] isaacs: i see.
[22:30] isaacs: hm.... would you consider a patch to have it go all stabby on enotdirs?
[22:30] SubStack: except if the last item in the path is a file then it will work silently even though that's wrong
[22:30] SubStack: isaacs: yes that would rock
[22:30] isaacs: k
[22:30] isaacs: ACTION adds to mountainous todo list.

[22:31] isaacs: SubStack: i'm also sort of trying to work out how to get the quasi-stickybit behavoir that npm's mkdir-p has.
[22:32] isaacs: the idea being that if you create /a/b/c/d/e/f, let's say, and /a/b/c exists and is a dir owned by user "foo", then it'll set the owner of /a/b/c/d and e and f as "foo"
[22:32] ChrisPartridge has joined the channel
[22:32] domino14: what does "unsign_value" quite do?
[22:33] mattrobenolt: It's just validating the values and returing true/false.
[22:33] domino14: it checks to see if the signature is valid?
[22:33] mattrobenolt: Err, validates the signature.
[22:33] mattrobenolt: Yeah.
[22:33] domino14: oh ok it's just verifying the one-way hash
[22:33] mattrobenolt: Yep.
[22:33] SubStack: isaacs: that would also be handy, I've run into problems with ownership using mkdirp before
[22:33] jimt has joined the channel
[22:33] domino14: awesome
[22:33] mattrobenolt: And nobody can recreate that hash without knowing your secret key.
[22:33] isaacs: yeah that was a huge bear that i'd rather not wrestle again...
[22:34] mattrobenolt: That's the point of an HMAC.
[22:34] isaacs: but... well, that's what it's looking like.
[22:34] mattrobenolt: It's sorta like a salt.
[22:34] domino14: can't they just brute force it
[22:34] domino14: ;)
[22:34] mattrobenolt: I mean, they CAN. But realistically, no. You could always bump to a higher encryption algorithm.
[22:34] mattrobenolt: Like SHA512.
[22:34] mattrobenolt: Instead of sha1.
[22:34] elcuervo has joined the channel
[22:34] isaacs: SubStack: whatever the case, i think the ownership stuff should be in fstream, not mkdirp
[22:34] tlynn has joined the channel
[22:34] mattrobenolt: Then your signature is going to be fucking huge.
[22:34] elcuervo: Hello guys, i was wondering, is there any commonly user router, as Rack for ruby?
[22:34] Aria: And a bigger key.
[22:35] isaacs: SubStack: and then mkdirp just has to provide some way to get at the stat results as they're gotten
[22:35] Aria: Stronger hash won't protect you if the key is weak.
[22:35] mattrobenolt: Aria: Right. That too. If he's using Django, Django provides a pretty solid SECRET_KEY upon project creation.
[22:35] SubStack: isaacs: the return value isn't used for anything, could be an event emitter
[22:35] SubStack: then you can hook onto the stats
[22:35] isaacs: hmm...
[22:35] isaacs: yeah, that'd be handy
[22:35] isaacs: good idea
[22:35] Aria: good. (how many bits?)
[22:35] SubStack: although right now it doesn't do any stats
[22:35] isaacs: SubStack: right, it just does the mkdir
[22:36] SubStack: yep and only cares if mkdir shits itself
[22:36] isaacs: right..
[22:36] kkszysiu has joined the channel
[22:36] mattrobenolt: It's 50 chars long.
[22:36] mattrobenolt: And I think it's out of the whole ASCII range.
[22:36] tlrobinson has joined the channel
[22:37] isaacs: SubStack: so.... it'd have to notice the first mkdir that *did* work, then get the stat from the parent of that dir, and set the ownership appropriately?
[22:37] mattrobenolt: For example, here's a chunk of a key: (^7q=&pd9um#a-eg+qvf*_5#8
[22:37] SubStack: it could just stat everything
[22:38] captain_morgan has joined the channel
[22:38] isaacs: SubStack: and catch ENOTDIRs and go stabby
[22:38] mattrobenolt: According to a calculator, those specs yield 2e86 possibilities.
[22:38] SubStack: sure
[22:38] isaacs: ok, i'm gonna post an issue to capture this, because i won't get to it before i forget about it
[22:38] mattrobenolt: 8e94 if we add capital letters into the mix. I'm not sure if Django uses caps or not.

[22:42] Aria: Yeah.
[22:42] Aria: isaacs: How do you feel about the tap harness only trying to run executable files?
[22:42] Aria: (and perhaps implementing option parsing, like a --help or some usage hints?)
[22:42] isaacs: Aria: these are wonderful ideas!
[22:42] isaacs: you should send me a patch ;)
[22:43] Aria: I shall. I just wanted a feeler for acceptance before I go tearing in ;-)
[22:43] vvo has joined the channel

[22:43] Marko_: what would be way to do this in node.js? urlencode(base64_encode(hmac($api_secret_key, $signature_string)))

[22:43] SubStack: automating yourself out of a job eh?
[22:44] Marko_: im looking: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.3.1/api/crypto.html
[22:44] isaacs: Aria: if you add option parsing, and it doesn't arleady use it, i'm partial to nopt, since i grok it deeply and can fix its bugs easiy.

[22:50] mattrobenolt: You have a key, then a signature string.
[22:51] mattrobenolt: Those are kinda contradictory.
[22:51] mattrobenolt: You have a key, which signs a value.
[22:51] mattrobenolt: In an HMAC>
[22:51] Marko_: $signature_string = "GET" . chr(10) . $url['host'] . chr(10) . $url['path'] . chr(10) . $request;
[22:51] skm has joined the channel
[22:51] mattrobenolt: Ok, gotcha. So that's the value you're trying to sign.
[22:51] Marko_: so its a string like salt i think?
[22:51] mattrobenolt: No, secret key is the salt.
[22:51] Marko_: ok, cool. im not familiar with terms
[22:52] mattrobenolt: In your case signature string is the value you're trying to sign and make sure it's safe.
[22:52] mattrobenolt: You wnat a signature for that value.

[22:59] Marko_: whats the difference then?
[23:00] mattrobenolt: Heroku already has the web server and everything ready for you to deploy an app.
[23:00] mattrobenolt: It handles scaling and all that fun stuff automatically.
[23:00] mattrobenolt: Rackspace Cloud server is (to a sysadmin) the same thing as a bare metal server. Nothing on it.

[23:02] chilts: though there are certainly blurry lines between them all :)
[23:02] Marko_: ive used google app engine for two years
[23:02] mattrobenolt: You have much more control with a real server than you do Heroku. If you need to step outside the comfort zone a little bit, Heroku won't be able to handle it.

[23:05] Marko_: way to go, just playing, lol
[23:05] mattrobenolt: So their PaaS is built off of Amazon's IaaS, and you're using the PaaS to deploy your SaaS!

[23:08] Marko_: Aas'es are better busines model than one time websites definitely

[23:10] Marko_: but hey, thanks,  will come up after more experiments
[23:10] mattrobenolt: jerrysv: That's good then. I can see if it they were targeting AWS users already.
[23:10] mattrobenolt: But as a generic service… that'd be rough. Nobody on another host would want to use it. Well, shouldn't want to use it.

[23:20] isaacs: auser: hey
[23:20] dwasp: about mongohq: some clients don't need an application server just to host an api
[23:20] isaacs: auser: it's better to use the minimatch lib.
[23:20] isaacs: auser: it doesn't do dir walking for you, but if you just wanna test strings, then it's way better.
[23:21] isaacs: auser: and no compilation
[23:21] mattrobenolt: dwasp: How could you host an API without an app server?
[23:21] isaacs: auser: i'm planning to port glob over to use that for its guts, but haven't gotten to it yet
[23:21] dwasp: it's document storage based on keys and ids
[23:21] auser: k, perhaps I can help if I have some time...
[23:21] dwasp: mongo doesn't care what kind of client connects to it, as long as it sends the proper commands
[23:21] auser: thx
[23:22] Zarel_ has joined the channel
[23:22] mattrobenolt: dwasp: oh, so you're saying the API queries directly on the database?
[23:22] dwasp: anyone know how to access an express/connect session outside of the req/res cycle?
[23:22] dwasp: saying the client could, yeah
[23:22] eddyb: no one knowing the answer to my question?
[23:22] dwasp: similar to amazon's simpledb thing
[23:22] Renegade001: Sorry for asking this but the channel list on Freenode is too damn big, is there any active UI channels or anything of the sort on Freenode?
[23:22] mattrobenolt: Right, but SimpleDB is used by people who have EC2 instances.
[23:23] domino14: hi mattrobenolt am i doing something wrong with your signature code? https://gist.github.com/1338244
[23:23] domino14: i took those values from your python test code, and i get 'false'

[23:24] alexdoom has joined the channel
[23:24] isaacs: auser: right, so, you're looking to select from the filesystem.
[23:24] isaacs: auser: glob.GLOB_STAR should work, then
[23:24] isaacs: auser: you're using glob(), not glob.fnmatch(), right?
[23:24] auser: I'm looking for a recursive directory walk for files of the pattern: *_test.coffee, I suppose I'll just have to write a custom function
[23:24] auser: yep
[23:24] isaacs: (fnmatch never supports glob_star)
[23:25] isaacs: auser: check out SubStack's findit utility

[23:25] mattrobenolt: domino14: Hmm, that's odd.

[23:37] eddyb: why are tty Read/WriteStreams Sockets?
[23:37] eddyb: freaking SOCKETS??
[23:37] domino14: cuz sockets are awesome
[23:37] SargoDarya: indeed they are. I'm loading all my player data over sockets

[23:38] eddyb: ReadStream WriteStream
[23:38] eddyb: they both inherit Socket

[23:41] mattrobenolt: domino14: I'm on crack right now or something.
[23:42] ryah: mmalecki: yeah - two of those tests are going to be hard to port to windows
[23:42] domino14: lol
[23:42] wadey has joined the channel
[23:42] ryah: mmalecki: but i need to talk with piscisaureus_ and igorzi about them
[23:42] mattrobenolt: I can't even get it to create the right hash in Python now, haha, it keeps giving me the hash that Node is returning.
[23:42] mmalecki: ryah: you mean my tests?
[23:42] domino14: doh
[23:42] ryah: mmalecki: in particular im not sure ENOTSOCK exists on windows...
[23:43] eddyb: ryah: what has Socket that Stream doesn't have and it's useful for a tty?
[23:43] ryah: mmalecki: since sockets have thier own "namespace"
[23:43] ryah: eddyb: what's a Stream?
[23:43] mmalecki: ryah: yeah, I've tried using them. once.
[23:43] mmalecki: I recall crying.
[23:43] ryah: mmalecki: er pipes, i mean
[23:43] domino14: '8a8d431c4bee603699e3fd3e9593a3264af0f57c'
[23:43] domino14: '8a8d431c4bee603699e3fd3e9593a3264af0f57c'

[23:47] eddyb: ryah: thanks for the challenge, I'll sure keep you posted
[23:47] domino14: mattrobenolt: oh, it's a stateful thing?
[23:47] mattrobenolt: domino14: I guess so.
[23:47] mattrobenolt: https://gist.github.com/1338289 Makes it work for you.
[23:48] mattrobenolt: Sorry, I haven't touched my crypto library in a while. And the part where I'm interacting with Node, I'm signing cookies and not using my library. :)
[23:48] domino14: well everythng works now — thank you!
[23:48] mattrobenolt: I forgot I was sha1 hashing my key first.
[23:48] domino14: the only thing is those signatures also have to be secret huh
[23:48] domino14: i mean, or someone could just submit someone else's hash
[23:48] domino14: maybe i can generate the secret key dynamically
[23:48] mattrobenolt: You really don't need to do that. You could take out L25 of my crypto.py and just use secret instead of key.
[23:49] mattrobenolt: Right, you secret key is secret to your servers only.
[23:49] mattrobenolt: If someone else gets it, they can forge a request.
[23:49] mattrobenolt: Just use one of those many password generator things and make one like, 50 characters long.
[23:49] domino14: but i mean even if someone gets someone else's signature they can also forge the request
[23:49] mattrobenolt: No, you have one secret on the whole server.
[23:50] AvianFlu_ has joined the channel
[23:50] mattrobenolt: That's why in my crypto library, I'm by default using the Django SECRET_KEY that's auto generated.
[23:50] mattrobenolt: I then stick that secret key in one of my configs for Node.

[23:50] domino14: but if a user is viewing another user's data and then the other user chooses to turn his data stream off
[23:50] domino14: the first user can use the hash to view the data in the future
[23:50] ryan_stevens has joined the channel
[23:50] mattrobenolt: No.
[23:51] mattrobenolt: Keys are individual. The key is global to everyone.
[23:51] mattrobenolt: Using my example, you have the string 'value1'.
[23:51] mattrobenolt: It's signed with the signature '8a8d431c4bee603699e3fd3e9593a3264af0f57c'.
[23:51] auser_ has joined the channel
[23:51] mattrobenolt: Now, if the value is changed, nobody else can generate a valid signature to match without your secret key used to sign it.
[23:52] mattrobenolt: It's like a normal SHA1 hash, but with salt. Sorta.
[23:52] jimt has joined the channel
[23:52] Murvin has joined the channel
[23:52] domino14: but if a user's name is 'value2' he can use the value1 signature to forge a request by sending node:   value1signature, value1  and node will think it was user named 'value 1' who sent it
[23:52] mattrobenolt: That's why the key must be kept private.
[23:52] jbrokc_ has joined the channel
[23:52] zmbmartin has joined the channel
[23:52] Aria: Salt?
[23:52] mattrobenolt: Oh, yeah, I see what you mean.
[23:53] zomg: If you're hashing passwords, use node-bcrypt
[23:53] mattrobenolt: That's why people typically sign a timestamp in with the request.
[23:53] domino14: so i gotta make sure to handle shared data views carefully
[23:53] domino14: hmm
[23:53] fly-away has joined the channel
[23:54] Murvin: is that right?  app.register('.html', ejs) ?
[23:54] mattrobenolt: People will then shove that all in a url, like:  ?key=value1&expires=1320364433431&signature=8a8d431c4bee603699e3fd3e9593a3264af0f57c
[23:54] domino14: oh and the expiration date can be like a few seconds in the future
[23:54] mattrobenolt: That expires time might be 5 minutes in the future, just to give some slack with server times, or 10 minutes, whatever you're comfortable with. And the signature then is a hash of the entire query string without the signature.
[23:54] tjholowaychuk: Murvin looks fine
[23:55] domino14: sweet
[23:55] mattrobenolt: Yeah. Typically you'll take all the query string parameters and normalize them by putting them into alphabetical order. Then hashing the entire query.
[23:55] domino14: that sounds reasonable
[23:55] mattrobenolt: Then tack on the signature key.
[23:55] mattrobenolt: Make sense?
[23:55] Murvin: yes.. that's what I'm doing and a lot of sites doing.
[23:55] domino14: yep, that has been very helpful!
[23:55] mattrobenolt: In my crypto.py, I have a "sign_query" function. ;)
[23:55] Murvin: Opps. thats refer to Mattrobenolt. not my question
[23:56] mattrobenolt: It takes a dictionary object to sign and inserts a signature key.
[23:56] domino14: cryptography is awesome
[23:57] mattrobenolt: This isn't really cryptography, it's just security.
[23:57] Murvin: tjholowaychuk:  so.. test.html will resolve into test.ejs, right? hmm but it doesn't seem working.
[23:57] mattrobenolt: And hashing. Cryptogrophy (at least to me) implies encrypting/decrypting.
[23:57] tjholowaychuk: Murvin that just means that res.render('foo.html') and the file foo.html will be considered ejs
[23:57] Murvin: mattrobenolt:  what u trying to do?  I have done a lot of encrypting thing .
[23:57] tjholowaychuk: instead of the default module "html"
[23:57] mattrobenolt: These are just checksums, essentially.
[23:57] tjholowaychuk: which wouldnt exist
[23:58] mattrobenolt: Murvin: ?
[23:58] Murvin: mattrobenolt: i just log in and see part of your conversations.. :)
[23:59] mattrobenolt: Murvin: I'm fine. I'm helping domino14.
