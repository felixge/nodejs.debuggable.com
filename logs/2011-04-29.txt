[00:04] chapel: Bwen: when you define functions as methods like that you usually do it like test: function(res) {} not test: function test(res) {} // but I don't know if that is exactly the reason
[00:04] chapel: but...
[00:04] Bwen: nevermind I understand why now. here is a simplified version http://pastie.org/1845489
[00:04] chapel: I do know that you have an object in an arry
[00:05] Bwen: when you define the callback it takes the scope of test2 only... not the entire struct
[00:05] stagas: Bwen: you only pass the function reference, so 'this' is lost
[00:05] Bwen: yeah
[00:05] Bwen: I keep forgetting :P
[00:05] stagas: Bwen: function() { vhost.test2() } will work
[00:06] Bwen: but is it proper tho...
[00:06] Bwen: I mean, is it gonna come back to haunt me in the long run?
[00:08] avalanche123 has joined the channel

[00:09] jmoyers: to use an object in a closure to maintain scope
[00:09] chrislorenz has joined the channel
[00:10] jmoyers: you can also use .call(this) to occasionally change the scope inside the function
[00:11] Bwen: aight, thx
[00:11] jmoyers: i also use a snipped out of prototype to return a bound function -- http://www.prototypejs.org/api/function/bind

[00:16] jmoyers: mraleph: my snippets do, if its available
[00:16] jmoyers: like underscore, i use the native functions if they are available, but aren't always

[00:33] Tobsn: wups
[00:33] Tobsn: lol
[00:33] Tobsn: nevermind.
[00:33] Tobsn: haha.
[00:33] Tobsn: well but there is another question - i wonder if its possible to run a webserver and accept stdin
[00:34] konobi: not _really_, since an fd is different from a socket
[00:34] Tobsn: yeah... its kinda not possible i think
[00:35] Tobsn: the reason i want to use it as a logging server for lighttpd... the access log can be piped and according to the lighttpd source and the lighttpd guys it doesnt hit the file everytime, it will load it once and keep piping to it
[00:36] konobi: oh that's fine

[00:36] perezd has joined the channel
[00:36] konobi: trying to use STDIN as an input for a nodejs webserver would be different

[00:37] Mrfloyd has joined the channel
[00:37] konobi: just accepting input on STDIN would be fine
[00:37] Tobsn: but lets say i run the node.js script
[00:37] Tobsn: node blah.js
[00:37] Tobsn: how do i pipe to it?
[00:37] konobi: echo "foo" | node script
[00:37] Tobsn: but the script ends when its done, doesnt it?
[00:38] konobi: sure, but it won't end if you're listening for input
[00:39] Tobsn: hmm
[00:39] Tobsn: lemme try that out
[00:39] konobi: node will only exit when it's stopped listening for events
[00:39] Tobsn: but wouldnt it spawn just another node instance than?
[00:39] konobi: no
[00:41] Tobsn: one dumb quick question, how do you fs.writeFile and append?

[01:11] isaacs: Tobsn: that's on purpose
[01:11] Tobsn: why?
[01:11] isaacs: you're installing things globally.  why?
[01:12] Tobsn: yep
[01:12] isaacs: if you want to require() them, then install them locally
[01:12] Tobsn: problem is if i install a package node doesnt find it
[01:12] isaacs: this is better.
[01:12] Tobsn: oh
[01:12] isaacs: Tobsn: install it locally in your project.
[01:12] isaacs: node will find it
[01:12] Tobsn: what if i want to install them global?
[01:12] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[01:12] isaacs: cd my-project; npm install express ; then require("express") works
[01:12] demastrie has left the channel
[01:12] no-gooder: why  i get    <<<   object has no method "send" >>> error on this code  http://jsfiddle.net/Umj4R/   ??
[01:12] isaacs: Tobsn: you can `npm link express` to link the global express into your project.
[01:12] Tobsn: npm install express -g ends up in lib/node_modules and node cnat find it
[01:12] isaacs: Tobsn: but realyl, it's better to just install everything locally.  you only need global installs for bin files.
[01:13] Tobsn: shouldnt it able to find it?
[01:13] isaacs: Tobsn: nope.
[01:13] isaacs: Tobsn: global is not for require()
[01:13] mscdex: no-gooder: which line ?
[01:13] Draggor: You can also set a NODE_PATH env variable
[01:13] Tobsn: oh.
[01:13] isaacs: global is to put things in the $PATH
[01:13] Tobsn: oooooh. well misunderstanding
[01:13] isaacs: Tobsn: install locally.  it's better :)
[01:13] Tobsn: what about the link?
[01:13] Tobsn: does that install it global and link to it?
[01:13] no-gooder: mscdex,  it's   defers[ix].send( msg ) line
[01:13] isaacs: yeah
[01:14] isaacs: Tobsn: the idea there is that you can then have every one of your projects share the single installation by using symlinks into each project.
[01:14] Tobsn: but where is it coming from?
[01:14] Tobsn: i mean where does the symlink link to
[01:14] Tobsn: g?
[01:14] isaacs: but it has weird effects sometimes, ie, when express does require("jade") it'll find the global one, not the local on
[01:14] Tobsn: ha...
[01:14] isaacs: Tobsn: -g installs stuff to /usr/local/lib/node_modules.  non-global installs install to ./node_modules
[01:14] Draggor: I gotta say that sounds like the opposite of every other package manager out there
[01:15] mscdex: no-gooder: because defers is an array, it has no 'send' method
[01:15] isaacs: Draggor: it's quite similar to bundler, actually
[01:15] mscdex: no-gooder: er wait
[01:15] Draggor: I have not encountered bundler before
[01:15] Tobsn: so if i do link it will install it global and link local?
[01:15] Draggor: ah, ruby, that's why
[01:15] mscdex: no-gooder: yeah, you're pushing arrays into defers
[01:16] mscdex: no-gooder: so i'm guessing you want defers[ix][1].write(msg) ?

[01:21] isaacs: that was a tricky one
[01:21] Tobsn: what was it?
[01:21] Tobsn: 0 nobody?
[01:21] isaacs: has to do with being root, and installing in a root-owned dir, and the fact that 0 and null are both falsey

[01:29] eshira: I have a socket.io server running at 9000. I have a rails server at 80, so I use a nginx reverse proxy to forward urls with /nodejs/ to 9000. I also have a reverse proxy so that socket.io/socket.io.js points to 9000. But socket.io isn't connecting on the server (e.g. socketio.on('connection', function(client) {...}); doesn't even run). On the browser, I do new io.Socket(host_uri, {port: 80});. Any ideas how this stuff works?
[01:29] bartt has joined the channel
[01:30] Draggor: pyrotechnick1: chaos
[01:30] pyrotechnick1: it's just a hash key

[01:34] chapel: for json, which you were asking about, I just used keys, so db.set('jsonkey', json_here...
[01:34] mscdex: eshira: you could have a node process be the reverse proxy instead, which supports websocket connections. then proxy the required connections to the rails server and others to a separate node instance or the same instance
[01:34] blueadept: is stack exchange down?
[01:34] Draggor: Yeah, I see how it works, I'm playing around in the repl.  I guess I'm just looking for the why.  I guess it's like a namespace thing?  Just another level of key specification?
[01:35] Draggor: So if you know large groups of things will be separate, you can just spread out into different hkeys?

[02:15] A_Nub: not good enough of an answer
[02:15] mscdex: heh
[02:16] mjr_: I have famously done a test where I used all of them.
[02:16] A_Nub: how many?
[02:16] mjr_: 65535
[02:16] A_Nub: all simultaneous?
[02:16] JianMeng has joined the channel
[02:16] mjr_: well, 65532, because of stdin, stdout, and stderr
[02:16] mjr_: Sure
[02:16] mjr_: It all depends on how much data each of them are servicing.
[02:17] mjr_: In my case, it was a single keepalive every 60 seconds across all 64K connections.
[02:17] A_Nub: Well I ask because im deciding wether or not to use a CDN or just clone a bunch of node servers for my own mini CDN
[02:17] A_Nub: well each download is 30 - 90mb
[02:17] zivester has joined the channel
[02:17] mjr_: CDN will probably always win in a performance battle
[02:18] A_Nub: Well im just wondering
[02:18] A_Nub: because apache is horrid
[02:18] A_Nub: its something like 20 parallel downloads
[02:18] eshira: mscdex: OK, I understand that. Thanks! Reading around, it seems that some people have solved it (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2419346/can-nginx-be-used-as-a-reverse-proxy-for-a-backend-websocket-server).

[02:46] benmills has joined the channel
[02:47] TheDeveloper has left the channel
[02:47] cbiscardi: eshira: yes, you should be able to declare what transports you want to use
[02:48] Bwen: chapel: the way I am constructing my vhostServer is that it will requilre('/var/www/somedomain/public/index.js'); it is good that it is cached and efficient. but for developing... its a hassle to shutdown the server for ALL hosts just to update 1 vhost
[02:48] benmills: I'm trying to get a package.json set up for npm for my node addon. I need to run node-waf configure build on preinstall, which works fine. However when I require the module it returns an empty object.
[02:49] chapel: Bwen: use something like restartr
[02:49] Bwen: chapel: so I was thinking if it would be possible to put a ?nodecache=refresh in the url and when I arrive for requiring it again I would check for that querying and just refresh THAT specific file. and not having to shutdown all host
[02:49] chapel: it will watch files that you change, and restart the server automatically
[02:50] Bwen: there is no need for restart either... Are you saying there is no way to "uncache" it? 
[02:50] Bwen: a second parameter would be nice... loadFromCache=true by default
[02:50] chapel: well require works the way it does for a reason
[02:51] chapel: it isn't really meant to be used to load config data

[03:02] sirkitree|dindin has joined the channel
[03:02] marcello3d: the main problem is the frequency and the range
[03:03] marcello3d: e.g. last train at 10:30pm kinda thing
[03:03] fr0stbyte: i'm getting an error "cannot find module 'url''". is this in the core library? i'm including the 'http' module. quick tip where to look?
[03:03] marcello3d: and caltrain runs hourly except during rush hour
[03:03] fr0stbyte: also using socket.io
[03:03] marcello3d: bart is a little better, but slow
[03:03] marcello3d: (and covers a different area)
[03:04] Darshan-NowJS: marcello3d: if caltrain and bart made a baby, id love it
[03:04] Darshan-NowJS: the spaciousness and cleanliness of caltrain, with the frequency and range of bart
[03:04] cbiscardi: marcello3d: 1030 is way early to stop. i'm used to hitching the last subway back to long island
[03:04] marcello3d: cbiscardi: agreed, it makes socializing with people difficult
[03:04] marcello3d: but they're super underfunded because no one rides it
[03:05] marcello3d: and last I was there, they wanted to cut all the weekend trains
[03:05] cbiscardi: marcello3d: dam, thats crazy underfunded
[03:05] marcello3d: http://www.caltrain.com/schedules/weekdaytimetable.html
[03:06] cbiscardi: marcello3d: hows driving/parking compared to the trains?
[03:06] marcello3d: that's all of caltrain
[03:06] marcello3d: cbiscardi: from where to where?
[03:06] marcello3d: and what hours? :)
[03:06] cbiscardi: marcello3d: dunno, somewhere outside sf to inside sf, haha. I guess it was kind of a lame question
[03:07] pquerna: Darshan-NowJS: they are in progress of replacing all the BART trains.. but ti;'ll prolly take another 5 years :-/
[03:07] marcello3d: cbiscardi: I wouldn't do it personally
[03:07] marcello3d: driving in sf
[03:07] marcello3d: only do it if you have to kind of thing
[03:07] marcello3d: if you're working in SF
[03:08] chapel: fr0stbyte: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.7/api/url.html
[03:08] marcello3d: it's probably worth trying to live in SF. or somewhere near a caltrain/bart stop
[03:08] cbiscardi: marcello3d: driving in ny is terrible, chicago can be bearable.
[03:08] marcello3d: I think bart goes till 1:30am
[03:08] marcello3d: so it's a little better
[03:08] cbiscardi: marcello: yea, thats what i'd probabley end up doing if i couldnt live within city limits.
[03:08] marcello3d: and usually every 20 minutes. they have lcds at most (all?) stations so that helps

[03:37] marcello3d: oh, technically a mongodb driver is supposed to check if the server it connected to is a master
[03:37] marcello3d: and if it's not, find the master
[03:37] therto: ah i see
[03:37] marcello3d: because I think you can only do reads on a secondary server
[03:37] marcello3d: I don't know the specifics, I'm learning as I go :)
[03:37] therto: wouldnt the native driver do that?
[03:37] marcello3d: it would
[03:37] cbiscardi: the native driver isnt fun to work with

[03:39] therto: ok, that makes sense now.
[03:40] therto: hmm
[03:40] marcello3d: it's basically a way for me to learn node.js, mongodb, and make a package other people might like :)
[03:41] therto: shame the API is not stable. i'd consider building on top of it..
[03:41] therto: i'll watch.
[03:42] marcello3d: :)
[03:42] marcello3d: it's stable in the sense that I'm trying to match the mongodb shell api
[03:42] LowValueTarget has joined the channel
[03:42] marcello3d: but I've been tweaking how some of the node-specific aspects work (such as the format of the connection)
[03:43] marcello3d: but I don't want to promise it will be the same tomorrow just yet
[03:44] therto: yeah fair call..
[03:45] therto: i've been using Mongolia for the same reasons as you, basically to learn about mongo and node.
[03:45] marcello3d: yea, I looked at mongolia
[03:45] marcello3d: I forget what I didn't like about it
[03:45] therto: i took what Pau had done and used that for awhile until it started to hurt.. then i ripped out the bits i wanted and built my own on top of a minimal impl.
[03:46] marcello3d: oh, mongolia is an ORM
[03:46] marcello3d: that's what I didn't like
[03:46] therto: yeah it's kinda ORM'ish
[03:46] marcello3d: I mean, nothing wrong with ORMs, but not what I was looking for
[03:46] fr0stbyte: anyone using node-jquery? it works great but having issues getting the document.ready event.. $(function().. doesn't work, but (function() { })(jQuery) does
[03:46] therto: same
[03:47] marcello3d: so I used mongo native for a while
[03:47] therto: i want to be able to do ORM but withoug being locked into it.
[03:47] marcello3d: and got pretty fed up
[03:47] marcello3d: yea
[03:47] marcello3d: ideally I'd get mongolian db to the point where someone could easily build a lightweight ORM on top of it
[03:47] therto: yeah i that's why i took what Pau had done and used that as a basis - it kinda hides the native bits.
[03:47] marcello3d: that wouldn't hide anything, but extend
[03:47] therto: sounds good.
[03:48] marcello3d: but I don't plan on being that someone :)
[03:48] marcello3d: so don't wait up ;D
[03:48] therto: yeah
[03:48] therto: i wont
[03:48] therto: i dont really care about ORM to be honest.. kinda sick of that style of code.
[03:48] marcello3d: you can actually see the source for the mongodb shell here: http://api.mongodb.org/js/1.8.1/files.html
[03:48] marcello3d: it's all javascript
[03:48] therto: ah
[03:48] marcello3d: but it's all synchronous
[03:48] marcello3d: so it doesn't all translate to node.js
[03:48] therto: i se
[03:49] therto: *see
[03:49] therto: i've just refactored my app last night to use my implementation - i call it "Drongo" :)
[03:50] therto: i wanted to try a plugin type approach for commands, not sure it's really working out very well.
[03:50] therto: that way i could add the commands as i needed them.
[03:51] marcello3d: add commands to what?
[03:51] therto: they are cooked in a framework that provides validatation etc. which are also implemented in a plugin type fashion.
[03:51] jdp has joined the channel
[03:51] marcello3d: actually, mongolian db has pretty much all you need for ORM

[03:51] therto: various things like, select, select many, insert, addtoset
[03:52] therto: i decided to make them commands in there own right

[04:21] mike_miller: I have two questions: 1. What cipher would you recommend for storing passwords in a database? (I need to get them out in plaintext, so salt + md5 is not feasible, and I also want to be reasonably efficient.) 2) Can a cipher/decipher object be reused after the "final" method is used on it?

[04:25] rudolfrck has joined the channel
[04:27] Billbad has joined the channel
[04:27] Aria: mike_miller: AES, but how you do key management is a large part of the problem.
[04:27] Aria: (... since you have to store the keys somewhere...)
[04:27] mike_miller: well, I'd just hardcode the keys into the server
[04:27] mike_miller: (the node server)
[04:27] mike_miller: yeah, bad practice, but I'm not storing credit card numbers or anything ;)
[04:27] mike_miller: and I'm protecting my db, obviously
[04:28] Aria: Heh. Okaay then.
[04:28] Aria: What are you protecting it against?
[04:28] mike_miller: won't AES be computationally intensive?
[04:28] mike_miller: my intuition that storing passwords in plaintext is bad :)
[04:28] JJMalina has joined the channel
[04:28] Aria: Storing them plain means you know what you need to protect.
[04:28] Aria: Not "Oh, It's encrypted, whatever."
[04:28] Aria: Is computational complexity a problem?
[04:29] Aria: How many operations per minute are you doing?
[04:29] mike_miller: uhm, ideally I'd like to be as scalable as possible

[04:29] marcello3d: billions a second, duh
[04:29] mike_miller: no, I'd have maybe 50,000 users max.
[04:29] mike_miller: so maybe a couple thousand a second at most?
[04:29] pyrotechnick1: bingomanatee: you there?
[04:29] mike_miller: 10,000 upper bound?
[04:30] mike_miller: even a couple thousand sounds pretty high
[04:30] marcello3d: never store passwords in plaintext
[04:30] Aria: http://cr.yp.to/aes-speed.html ... stop worrying.
[04:30] marcello3d: bcrypt em
[04:30] mike_miller: marcello3d: thank you for that wonderful insight! :)

[04:31] Aria: (bcrypt is wrong, that's hashed, marcello3d. Not encrypted.)
[04:32] marcello3d: I know
[04:32] mike_miller: onto my second question.. can I reuse the cipher/decipher object?
[04:32] mike_miller: (keep them as globals)
[04:32] marcello3d: the only reason to store unhashed passwords is if they're passwords to a second system
[04:32] vhost- has joined the channel
[04:32] mike_miller: that is the case.
[04:32] marcello3d: and that second system doesn't support oauth or similar
[04:32] mike_miller: correct.
[04:33] Aria: Or if you need to use digest authentication.
[04:33] Aria: .oO(Or if they're actually keys.)
[04:33] marcello3d: if you're storing someone else's private keys
[04:33] tonymilne: do you create the users on the second system via an API or anything? Maybe the password could actually be the hashed password from the first system.
[04:34] marcello3d: you should probably have a good security policy in place
[04:34] marcello3d: preferably with outside auditing
[04:34] __tosh has joined the channel
[04:35] mike_miller: tonymilne: I don't have control over the second system.

[04:37] Aria: Yeah. I'd AES them, store the keys as securely as possible. Make sure you use the right cipher mode( not sure what that is for short strings like that, I'd have to do some reading)
[04:37] Aria: Or blowfish. It's a symmetric cipher, since you're not encrypting for a second party, no need for PKI.

[04:39] therto: keltus - there is a stack limit
[04:39] mike_miller: more specifically, if it's possible to reuse the cipher/decipher
[04:39] Aria: I'm not sure.

[04:43] benw_: I need npm help
[04:43] Aria: (remember that bcrypt algorithm is a hash, not encryption)
[04:43] benw_: Am I supposed to be able to say require('express@2.3.2')?
[04:43] mike_miller: hashing won't work.
[04:43] benw_: npm install express@2.3.2 worked
[04:43] mike_miller: (for my use case)
[04:44] mscdex: benw_: no, require doesn't work that way
[04:44] Aria: benw: require('express')
[04:44] gkatsev: benw_: install it inside your module/app, then you just do require(express) or w/e
[04:44] benw_: Ah ok, thanks.
[04:44] benw_: So I'm meant to track dependencies in my package.json
[04:45] Aria: Yep.

[04:46] benw_: npm seems... different. But I think that's in a good way, once I get my head around it.

[04:47] gkatsev: mike_miller: if you want really strong amazing encryption, try scrypt: https://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html
[04:47] mike_miller: gkatsev: I'm just looking for something "better than plaintext"
[04:47] gkatsev: mike_miller: no, don't do that. Go for the best.
[04:47] therto: mike_miller: rot13 :)
[04:48] gkatsev: therto: haha
[04:48] mike_miller: therto: I actually considered that ;)
[04:48] therto: ceasar cipher ? :)
[04:49] gkatsev: mike_miller: but in all seriousness. Just use bcrypt.
[04:49] mike_miller: That won't work!
[04:49] mike_miller: I can't use a hash.
[04:49] mike_miller: period.
[04:49] hoodoos has left the channel
[04:49] mike_miller: no exceptions.
[04:49] gkatsev: why?
[04:49] mike_miller: :)
[04:49] mike_miller: Because I need to store the password for use in a second system, which expects the password in plaintext.
[04:49] gkatsev: um... what?
[04:49] Aria: He needs to be able to get the password /back/.
[04:50] Aria: bcrypt _is not encryption_
[04:50] gkatsev: yes, it's a password hashing algorithm
[04:50] marcello3d: gkatsev: I'd just put a disclaimer on your site
[04:51] gkatsev: mike_miller: can you make the other system use the hash as the password?
[04:51] mike_miller: no.
[04:51] Aria: ... Uh. 
[04:51] mike_miller: I have no control over the second system.
[04:51] gkatsev: lol
[04:51] gkatsev: ok
[04:51] marcello3d: "in order to provide this service, we have to store your passwords. They are encrypted database, and we've taken significant effort to protect them, but we cannot guarantee their safety."
[04:51] Aria: That also doesn't improve security.
[04:51] tbranyen: i use rot26 for password hashing
[04:51] onre has joined the channel
[04:51] tbranyen: seems to be working pretty well
[04:51] tonymilne: is that twice as secure to rot13?
[04:52] mike_miller: hah :)
[04:52] Aria: That's equivalent to plaintext passwords, because the hash /is/ the password.
[04:52] tbranyen: tonymilne: sometimes the best security is in plain sight :D
[04:52] marcello3d: I just hash all my passwords to cafebabe
[04:52] marcello3d: perfect security
[04:52] marcello3d: you'll never guess the original password
[04:52] marcello3d: (unless they use cafebabe as their password)
[04:52] tonymilne: cafed00d?
[04:52] marcello3d: (but how would you know?)
[04:52] tbranyen: gkatsev: there is a qrcode outside of bocoup that i scanned and it turned out to be dickbutt

[04:59] gkatsev: mike_miller: however, it really isn't that much better than plain-text.
[04:59] marcello3d: therto: if you do npm install mongolian, it'll get mongodb for you
[04:59] therto: i think i just npm install mongolia and it did the rest so i havent dug into anything else really..
[04:59] therto: ok
[04:59] mike_miller: it protects against someone breaking into the db, but not the server.

[06:16] stagas: and parses
[06:17] chapel: nice
[06:17] chapel: I didn't know that
[06:17] chapel: have you pushed that version?
[06:17] dandean: I've been using it for about 5 minutes and I'm pretty sure I'm going to just replace my entire API object abstraction layer with it.
[06:18] stagas: chapel: yeah might break some apps, it won't matter if you stringify yourself, but if you try to parse again it may throw

[06:21] zpao: ryah: if by chance you're around... is there a way to not build node with the JS stuffed into node_natives.h? rebuilding at every change isn't the most painful thing, but it's a bit annoying
[06:22] mkuklis: hi guys I'm new to node. I have a quick question about the inheritance and EventEmitter. I've seen different examples and seems like people prefer different approaches for example: Installer.prototype.__proto__ = EventEmitter.prototype; or by using sys.inherits module. I'm wondering which way is preferable  
[06:22] coreb: pyrotechnick1: generally you guys who talked about someone's speech
[06:22] zpao: ACTION will just ask again during normal hours
[06:23] mike_miller: to answer my own previous question: it appears not possible to reuse a cipher/decipher.
[06:23] cloudhead has joined the channel
[06:23] chapel: mkuklis: its util.inherits now
[06:23] chapel: and that is usually the best way
[06:23] pyrotechnick1: coreb: guy from ngmoco that spoke at the meetup at IGN today
[06:24] SubStack: mkuklis: I personally usually just do var self = new EventEmitter and add attributes onto that
[06:24] mkuklis: chapel: thanks I sort of like the direct prototype approach can you elaborate why it's usually the best way?
[06:25] SubStack: unless I'm writing something that's going to get instantiated a ton
[06:25] cloudhead: I have a child process which only seems to output when I pass process.stdout.fd as it's stdout in customFds.. any ideas why?
[06:25] SubStack: mkuklis: one thing you can't do with prototypes is sharing private scope among functions
[06:26] mkuklis: SubStack: thanks for the tips!
[06:26] SubStack: if you start adding lots of this._foos and this._bars I would go with the closure approach
[06:26] SubStack: but either way works plenty fine

[06:41] cloudhea1 has joined the channel

[06:43] chapel: v8: print('4');

[06:43] dandean: fljitovak: what if the file just says "console.log('4');"
[06:44] chapel: yeah what dandean said
[06:44] chapel: to explain, console.log is the proper way to output to the stdout/console
[06:44] onre_ has joined the channel
[06:45] fljitovak: that works
[06:45] fljitovak: Okay that makes sense. So print would be used in the browser, I guess.
[06:46] xiagox has joined the channel
[06:47] chapel: well

[09:58] Ned_: Anyone using node.js in Ubuntu?, what are you doing about the fact it's so far behind ?
[09:58] Ned_: ;-)
[09:58] jaket: any node.js projects looking for a UI guy?
[09:59] eirikb1: Ned_: I do, works fine?
[09:59] Ned_: eirikb1: what version are you using ?
[09:59] eirikb1: 0.5.0-pre I think
[09:59] Ned_: eirikb1: you built it yourself ?
[09:59] eirikb1: git pull;maaaaaake
[09:59] Ned_: heh, right
[10:00] Ned_: I was hoping I could find a PPA or something
[10:00] Ned_: eirikb1: so do you package it up ?
[10:00] eirikb1: Ned_: Nope
[10:00] Ned_: Hmmm
[10:01] eirikb1: wow, its version 0.2.6 in Ubuntu 11.04?
[10:01] Ned_: yes
[10:01] Ned_: I just dist-upgraded to 11.04
[10:01] Ned_: and well, that's a bit crap :-(
[10:01] Ned_: I guess I'll need to build myself a copy
[10:01] Ned_: I can't even run npm :-(
[10:02] Ned_: needs 0.4+
[10:02] eirikb1: You can probably install an older version of npm?
[10:02] ajak1: Ned_: build from source
[10:02] Ned_: eirikb1: that seems like a backwards step :p
[10:02] Ned_: ajak1: yes, that's the plan
[10:02] eirikb1: Ned_: Yes, building is the best option
[10:02] Ned_: although I'd like to make a package for it :p
[10:02] eirikb1: Why?
[10:02] Ned_: git://github.com/joyent/node.git
[10:03] Doup has joined the channel
[10:03] eirikb1: You can download the tar.gz stable instead
[10:03] Ned_: eirikb1: because I don't like putting random crap over my filesystem that isn't packaged
[10:03] Ned_: so I can easily remove things later :-)
[10:03] Ned_: and keep track of the fact it's installed at a particular version
[10:03] eirikb1: But you are already running Ubuntu? ho ho 
[10:04] jacter has joined the channel
[10:04] eirikb1: Building from the tar will give you a specific version
[10:04] Ned_: eirikb1: what dist are you running ?
[10:04] Ned_: :p
[10:05] eirikb1: 11.04
[10:05] eirikb1: Ubuntu
[10:05] eirikb1: And arch
[10:05] Ned_: Hmmm, 0.4.7 is in Debian sid
[10:05] eldios: arch ftw
[10:05] eldios: ACTION feels particoularly trolly today :3
[10:05] V1: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jerome-etienne/neoip && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nodejs :)?
[10:06] Ned_: V1: yeah, that's what I was afte r;-)
[10:06] Ned_: V1: is that what you're using ?
[10:06] eirikb1: On servers I usually use EC2 AMI or squeeze on my own boxes. Not sure about running sid, scary stuff
[10:06] V1: yes
[10:06] Ned_: okay, /me goes with that option

[10:23] industrial: took me 4sec
[10:24] xeodox: That doesn't work. Becauase mongoose got updated
[10:24] xeodox: It just hangs (even if I remove the "sort", and just add the .all)

[10:25] xeodox: The ".all" is hanging it
[10:28] xeodox: industrial: Nevermind, I figured it out.

[10:28] Emmanuel__: last time I tried, I had the same kind of problem
[10:28] xeodox: yes...the APi keeps changing.
[10:29] xeodox: I figured it out to be:
[10:29] xeodox: .sort('date',1).execFind(function...
[10:29] Emmanuel__: I guess the API changed a dozen time in between :)
[10:29] xeodox: sigh
[10:29] xeodox: that's what happens when you play with new stuff
[10:29] xeodox: back in my django days this would never happen
[10:29] Emmanuel__: and copy/pasting the example on the documentation failed...
[10:29] Emmanuel__: (eventually I gave up)
[10:31] eldios: ryah, can you please put in the topic "PLS, DON'T ASK TO ASK.. JUST ASK" .. and tell in the next talk you will have that when people come here in IRC should stick with that policy? :) thanks

[11:16] eldios: where did you get the 0-byte-character term?
[11:17] eldios: to me it looks like it wants a null send.. an empty UDP packet as a terminator
[11:17] eldios: not a packet with zero in it
[11:18] eldios: anyway gist your code or it will be difficult to help you more than this

[16:59] test1: Hi everyone, can anyone help with a problem I'm having with using expresso ? I'm trying to test responses from my server using assert.response . However, my tests seem to hang. Anyone know what I may be doing wrong ?
[16:59] chapel: andersjanmyr: if you have a long running calculation or something, it is best to spin off a worker, or use a separate process, the main process has to be non-blocking throughout, or else the server/app will be slow, very slow
[17:00] addisonj: what chapel said
[17:00] addisonj: its essentially the same as what you SHOULD be doing with all web-apps
[17:01] andersjanmyr: chapel: yes, I get that, but if I have a multiprocessor maching, should I use a child_process or a worker or something external like hadoop?
[17:01] GasbaKid has joined the channel
[17:01] chapel: well other webapp platforms usually don't have the benefit of the async nature of node, like handling i/o while letting the main thread keep working

[18:36] Navy: And in rthis i can use the function directly?
[18:36] adrusi: I'm on mac os x running version 10.6.7 and some serious error was encountered and I had to force shut down. When I looked at the log of the error, it said that the thread in which the error occured was namde "node". Any ideas how to find more info about the error? some sort of node logs?
[18:36] mscdex: LinuxNewb: yep

[18:52] _1marc: mbrevoort: req.headers.cookie shows only cookie: 'connect.sid=WPqgw9pD1mV9FrAyzGc6YCSH.hXTv6Q3v8j0%2BTqmp6dmjQZl8pGJGmaj%2BdmxBSsDYp3s'
[18:52] _1marc: member:mbrevoort: but there are other cookies set on the domain

[18:52] rubydiamond has joined the channel

[18:56] gf3: cloudhead: is it exiting before it's able to print to stdout?
[18:56] gf3: I had that issue previously
[18:56] cloudhead: gf3: nope, it stays running
[18:56] mbrevoort: _1marc: so the browser isn't even passing the cookies properly, as far as you can tell, in the request? You can see that in a network trace?
[18:57] cloudhead: and if I pass `1` as the stdout customFd, it works as expected, except its using the main stdout..
[18:57] _1marc: member:mbrevoort: right, it isn't coming through in the headers, but I know it is inside the browser.

[19:07] tjholowaychuk: _1marc: the session cookie should be the same as the others, just simply expiring when the browser session is complete
[19:07] mbrevoort: when using the express middleware it manages the session cookie for you. so there will be a session cookie that corresponds to your session on the server. The session is on the server though.

[19:09] _1marc: mbrevoort: ok I'll try that
[19:09] tjholowaychuk: _1marc: sure, httpOnly just means the client-side js wont have access to it
[19:10] _1marc: tjholowaychuk: It also says, "security: secure"

[19:12] tjholowaychuk: works for me
[19:12] tjholowaychuk: context: because you can use any store...
[19:12] mbrevoort: context: i'm pretty sure you can specify and alternative cookie provider like redis, but the man tjholowaychuk could confirm
[19:12] tjholowaychuk: memory is just a default
[19:12] _1marc: tjholowaychuk: yeah I can access connect.sid too, but the other cookie I cannot

[19:13] tjholowaychuk: context: not just in terms of room
[19:13] mbrevoort: _1marc: so did you say the other cookie is set to secure? in that case it wouldn't be passed over an http connection - the browser wouldn't pass it.

[19:53] tjholowaychuk: some day
[19:53] qbert__ has joined the channel
[19:53] EvanCarroll: so that's all done with express.js and not through jade.js, interesting
[19:53] tjholowaychuk: i will build a better site
[19:53] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[19:53] tjholowaychuk: jade just accepts local vars
[19:54] EvanCarroll: in TT, perl's premeir template engine, it's done through WRAPPER
[19:54] EvanCarroll: which is rather think is better. =(
[19:54] tjholowaychuk: what?
[19:54] EvanCarroll: because as a function of a the view, you can create your own. that's pretty useful.
[19:54] tjholowaychuk: WRAPPER?
[19:54] EvanCarroll: right.
[19:54] qbert_: ?
[19:54] indexzero has joined the channel
[19:55] tjholowaychuk: wtf is that
[19:55] tjholowaychuk: haha
[19:55] EvanCarroll: http://template-toolkit.org/docs/manual/Directives.html#section_WRAPPER
[19:55] kersny has joined the channel
[19:56] mwmw has joined the channel
[19:56] rpflo has joined the channel
[19:56] EvanCarroll: So in template toolkit, you'd do something like point your template (view input files) to body.tt, which would state at the top with the WRAPPER directive to use `layout.tt`. Then in layout.tt you'd pull in the output of `body.tt` to be wrapped through the special variable `CONTENT`
[19:57] EvanCarroll: so it's the wrapping/layout (in jade parlance i suppose), is done in the view.
[19:57] SubStack: EvanCarroll: those are called partials in express I think
[19:58] EvanCarroll: This means that things you include, partials (in jade parlance again I suppose) can use WRAPPER functionality
[19:58] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[19:58] SubStack: also express views have a layout.whatevs
[19:58] tjholowaychuk: partials look the same
[19:58] EvanCarroll: and how do you handle two wrappers?
[19:58] tjholowaychuk: just template-engine specific
[19:58] tjholowaychuk: have two partial() calls
[19:59] aroop has joined the channel
[19:59] EvanCarroll: right, which requires that the layout know of the partials?
[19:59] tjholowaychuk: I stay away from engine-specific stuff like that
[19:59] kersny has left the channel
[19:59] kersny has joined the channel
[19:59] EvanCarroll: that's breaking my concept of view-encapsulation.
[19:59] tjholowaychuk: how?
[20:00] tjholowaychuk: I want blocks
[20:00] tjholowaychuk: but
[20:00] EvanCarroll: because in TT the wrapper doesn't need to know anything about the callee, all it knows is that if it used it must drop the output of the callee in the special `content` variable.
[20:00] tjholowaychuk: we just need template engines to expose a function to buffer js
[20:00] onre_ has joined the channel
[20:00] tjholowaychuk: then that will be fine
[20:01] TheJH has joined the channel
[20:01] TheJH has joined the channel
[20:01] tjholowaychuk: EvanCarroll: I dont see how that is different
[20:01] tjholowaychuk: they just have some funky directive
[20:01] tjholowaychuk: [% INCLUDE
[20:02] EvanCarroll: the INCLUDE directive has nothing to do with what I'm talking about., that's just the equiv of the jade partial include
[20:03] pekim_ has joined the channel
[20:03] Votaguz has left the channel
[20:03] EvanCarroll: I'm speaking of the way the content is wrapped being a function of the view, with the wrapper ignorent of what it is wrapping, which might itself be a wrapper that is wrapping.
[20:03] tjholowaychuk: partial('header')
[20:03] tjholowaychuk: they have to many constructs
[20:05] EvanCarroll: a.tt => FOO [% content %] BAR ||| b.tt => [% WRAPPER a.tt %] QUZ [% content %] QAZ ||| [% WRAPPER b.tt %] c.tt => 'foo'
[20:05] kersny has joined the channel
[20:05] tykelewis has joined the channel
[20:05] EvanCarroll: so when you call `c.tt` as a view destination in the web framework, or as a partial/include, it goes through the natural wrappings.
[20:05] EvanCarroll: how would you do that in jade.js
[20:06] EvanCarroll: that would output FOO QUZ foo QUZ BAR 
[20:07] tjholowaychuk: c.tt just contains "foo"?
[20:07] EvanCarroll: I find that to be more transparent, useful outside of the webframework, and consistent with partial behavoir (because the web framework is ignorant to it) and partials are a function of the view and exist outside of it
[20:07] TooTallNate: tjholowaychuk: hey tj, is there a way to create a node-canvas "Image" from a Buffer on PNG/JPG data?
[20:07] EvanCarroll: tjholowaychuk: it was an example
[20:07] TooTallNate: *of
[20:07] tjholowaychuk: IMO that doesnt make sense for it to automagically be wrapped by the others
[20:07] EvanCarroll: tjholowaychuk: but yes, in this example c.tt just contains foo
[20:08] EvanCarroll: tjholowaychuk: it isn't automagically wrapper, there is an explicit WRAPPER construct that I'm demonstrating
[20:08] tjholowaychuk: TooTallNate: not right now unfortunately, i'd like to add support for that and sniff the image format from the first few bytes
[20:08] EvanCarroll: s/wrapper/wrapped/ *
[20:08] tjholowaychuk: EvanCarroll: yeah but it's in a different file
[20:08] TooTallNate: tjholowaychuk: Damn, ya that's exactly what I was hoping for...
[20:08] tjholowaychuk: :D
[20:09] tjholowaychuk: yeah me too, just havent had time
[20:09] tykelewis has joined the channel
[20:09] EvanCarroll: tjholowaychuk: you can also have a library of wrappers, not tied to the name of the partial.
[20:10] EvanCarroll: so you might see something like, [% WRAPPER = jqueryUIWidget %] emerge.

[20:11] mikeal has joined the channel
[20:11] tjholowaychuk: the most important thing to me is that these concepts work for most if not all the template engines

[20:32] malkomalko: npm question.. is there anyway to have the package take your dependencies and bundle them on install via 'npm bundle' instead of actually installing them and overwriting certain versions the user may have?
[20:32] teemow has joined the channel
[20:33] herbySk has joined the channel
[20:33] baudehlo: in fs.createReadStream() anyone know why "end" is required if "start" is given?
[20:34] techwraith: malkomalko: I'm fairly certain nothing is overwritten as it is
[20:35] techwraith: malkomalko: It should keep all it's dependencies in its own .node_modules directory
[20:35] hellp has joined the channel
[20:35] malkomalko: when you install an npm package, it's dependencies are installed, it's not bundled
[20:36] malkomalko: I'm fairly sure
[20:36] tbranyen: malkomalko: depends on the package.json
[20:37] mikeal has joined the channel
[20:37] context: techwraith: thats very ugly actually.
[20:37] context: techwraith: with that logic you could possibly have dependencies digging down god knows how many levels...
[20:37] mjr_: baudehlo: that's an annoying limitation from the internal implementation at the moment.  I thought isaacs said he was going to fix that a while back.
[20:38] nk_ has joined the channel
[20:38] techwraith: context: ask isaacs, but I'm pretty sure that's how it happens
[20:38] context: probably with the same package being installed n times.
[20:38] context: so. i install express, which requires conenct and jade, jade requires conenct (example) and all three require some random package like date-utils
[20:38] context: i just installed date-utils like 5 times.
[20:38] xiagox has joined the channel
[20:39] techwraith: Yep
[20:39] context: wow. your idea is the worst ever.
[20:39] techwraith: Not my idea
[20:39] techwraith: just how it works
[20:39] context: im gonna venture toward no. thats why package.json has dependencies listed
[20:40] context: oh
[20:40] baudehlo: mjr_: ok good... as right now the only way (race free) to read the whole file is with fs.open/fs.read calls.
[20:40] context: kk.
[20:40] context: techwraith: npm is using symlinks.

[20:40] brendanjerwin has joined the channel

[20:41] malkomalko: instead of installing
[20:41] hasenj has joined the channel
[20:41] malkomalko: I'm on 0.3.x
[20:41] malkomalko: 1.0 hopefully hits this weekend

[20:42] NSMeta has joined the channel
[20:42] malkomalko: that's wrong
[20:42] malkomalko: it lays everything you need out into the node_modules lib
[20:42] malkomalko: not 5 versions of the same lib
[20:43] malkomalko: there are pros and cons in both scenarios I guess
[20:43] context: malkomalko: so if i install express i dont have connect. express has connect.
[20:43] context: malkomalko: so i install connect, and it installs qs and mime again.

[20:43] context: so .... you still have the SAME problem
[20:44] tjholowaychuk: installing two tiny modules several times is a problem?
[20:44] malkomalko: I don't understand
[20:44] malkomalko: everything is than scoped to your project
[20:44] context: or im severly reading what you are saying wrong
[20:44] malkomalko: and doesn't pollute your global modules
[20:44] malkomalko: isn't that a good thing?
[20:45] context: malkomalko: then use nvm and its aliases ?
[20:45] baudehlo: is there any way to get better errors out of vm.* functions?
[20:45] baudehlo: they don't tell you the line number if something fails to compile.
[20:45] context: malkomalko: your idea still doesn't solve the issue. most projects depend on more than one library. so they'd need their own package.json to begin with

[20:48] context: nuckingfuts: ive been waiting for that
[20:48] malkomalko: nothing is wrong with symlinks, in fact that's how npm manages packages

[21:08] mape: few days for 1. ?
[21:08] isaacs: malkomalko: the current rc is almost 100% solid.  just a few little edge-case things.
[21:08] malkomalko: ok
[21:08] isaacs: malkomalko: but "proper" release and 0.x deprecation starts this weekend.
[21:09] context: hmm are we talking node 1.0 or npm
[21:09] context: :x

[21:11] eldios: =) my mistake
[21:11] Nexxy: assimilate

[21:12] mjr_: So how are you supposed to catch exceptions thrown by net read, net.js:163?  Seems uncatchable.
[21:12] kmiyashiro: if I do npm update -g with npm 1.0.1, it tries to install npm 0.3 :(
[21:12] eldios: mape, I made a script to make a check to see if you have certain npm modules installed..
[21:13] mape: mjr_: suspend belief, use your imagination ;)
[21:13] eldios: and it had to act differently from npm 1.x and 0.[2-3].x
[21:13] Nexxy: someone stole my alias ._.
[21:13] eldios: ^^
[21:13] mjr_: mape: also, keep your eye on the ball.
[21:13] context: kmiyashiro: the npm readme says the registry only shows 0.3 cause 1.0 is not stable yet
[21:14] mape: mjr_: the ball is under your bed, I can't catch it

[21:20] techwraith: 'cause technically I work at an incorporated company...
[21:20] Nexxy: techwraith, as soon as you have an HR department
[21:20] malkomalko: isaacs: you there?
[21:20] mape: tjholowaychuk: my coworker found it out just today randomly and thought it was awsome, I had to say yes... but. It is a pita having to keep eveything parseable, mixing spaces/tabs and k&r/allman, why doesn't stylus "just" use a css formater before doing magic?
[21:21] techwraith: Well then... I suppose I'm a corporate person

[21:21] techwraith: Nexxy, I meant that in a good way
[21:21] tjholowaychuk: mape: all you really need to do to keep it parsable is not write really weird css though lol
[21:21] tjholowaychuk: later versions are better
[21:22] context: npm defaults to installing to the current directory?
[21:22] tjholowaychuk: blueprint is fine, html boilerplate is fine now
[21:22] tjholowaychuk: mape: some things cause ambiguity that is not easy to parse or that I haven't implemented yet like how you were doing body\n{\n}
[21:22] Nexxy: techwraith, I suppose you're excused then...
[21:22] mape: tjholowaychuk: yeah, but I keep havin issues with css failing, c/p fancy buttons css, resets, odd ie hack etc

[21:23] tjholowaychuk: hack
[21:23] tjholowaychuk: I just added support for
[21:24] tjholowaychuk: but supporting indentation based AND css based syntaxes in the same parser
[21:24] tjholowaychuk: is challenging
[21:25] mape: tjholowaychuk: well the indentation part, isn't there already code for normalizing it?
[21:25] malkomalko: looks like binaries changes with npm 1.0.. since there is no more global node modules dir
[21:25] tjholowaychuk: mape: braces are optional
[21:25] mape: oh yeah
[21:25] tjholowaychuk: if it were just the css syntax
[21:25] mape: your fault.. :P
[21:25] tjholowaychuk: it would be so easy
[21:26] GasbaKid has joined the channel
[21:26] drudge: who doesn't love braces
[21:26] mape: so easier to go from strict no {} to {} and then parse it?
[21:26] tjholowaychuk: mape: well that's essentially the same as just parsing it
[21:26] tjholowaychuk: straight-up
[21:26] tjholowaychuk: same logic would be applied
[21:27] mape: then why is optional braces harder?
[21:27] tjholowaychuk: because i support both in the file at the same time
[21:27] tjholowaychuk: same parser
[21:27] duncanbeevers: tjholowaychuk: Why?
[21:27] tjholowaychuk: duncanbeevers: why not? :p you can use the indentation syntax, plop in something like blueprint as-is
[21:28] tjholowaychuk: and continue with your syntax
[21:28] tjholowaychuk: no need for a separate extension name etc
[21:28] mape: tjholowaychuk: what you should do, is just get two chickens, have them fight it one, and the one who wins gets to choose if you support {} or not
[21:28] tjholowaychuk: haha
[21:28] tjholowaychuk: meh
[21:28] mape: that makes total sense
[21:28] techwraith: I saw make them mandatory ;)
[21:28] tjholowaychuk: it's fine within reason, people just shouldnt do foo{ bar:baz}rawr{}
[21:29] tjholowaychuk: just cant be really bad css
[21:29] mape: and if you get an issue, just said the wrong chicken won
[21:29] duncanbeevers: Interesting, though kind of sloppy. I guess I feel like that kind of stuff should be handled by a separate post-transform concatenation step.

[21:34] tjholowaychuk: the boilerplate css
[21:34] tjholowaychuk: is bad
[21:34] tjholowaychuk: but it parsees
[21:34] context: uhh the npm-install man page doesnt show -g

[21:43] tjholowaychuk: though the messages are not always to helpful since most people dont think like a parser does

[22:07] tjholowaychuk: i had to change a bunch of stylus
[22:08] tjholowaychuk: because of require() giving a different object

[22:09] context: and not having an unknown amount of copies of everything installed
[22:09] isaacs: context: pretend that they're not nested, but that your dependencies just have no dependencies.
[22:09] isaacs: context: it's a known amount :)
[22:09] isaacs: context: npm ls will tell you how much :)
[22:10] context: hahaha
[22:10] context: hahahahaha !
[22:10] isaacs: context: you should name all the dependencies you depend on
[22:10] isaacs: and then you'll get them
[22:10] context: kk. ill hagle you when i get home some more
[22:10] context: ;)
[22:10] isaacs: and if they depend on different versions of things, then they'll get the versions that they need

[22:18] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: a file? of what?
[22:19] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: of anything, just text - like, to inline JS into a <script> tag for example
[22:19] tjholowaychuk: nope
[22:19] test: fight as in be in contention 
[22:19] tjholowaychuk: jade doesn't do IO
[22:19] isaacs: techwraith: so... you're at yammer now?
[22:19] isaacs: techwraith: oh, you said yammer, not yahoo

[22:19] techwraith: isaacs: That's what I said right?
[22:19] isaacs: sorry
[22:19] RoboTeddy: test: I would imagine that each node.js process is discrete — they wouldn't share memory or anything
[22:19] techwraith: lol
[22:19] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: oh I see, nonblocking and all that
[22:20] test: @robo do you use node in this way?
[22:20] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: That's a weird thing then, can I delay rendering until a callback or something? I guess I could put this stuff into the controller but it would be much nicer as something like a 'inline()' helper
[22:20] hunterloftis: test: Yes each instance is separate from the others
[22:20] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: you could do != inline('whatever')
[22:20] tjholowaychuk: but I dont want to include stuff like that in jade
[22:20] test: listening on same port i assume
[22:20] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: that's what I am writing right now, it seemed like somebody had probably already written it, which is why I came to check - not in core, just, some extension somewhere
[22:20] test: load balancing as such
[22:21] RoboTeddy: test:	oh, no, different ports
[22:21] RoboTeddy: test: with some kind of proxy / load balancer in front
[22:21] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: it would be like one line :p
[22:21] test: different ports ?
[22:21] test: ahhh i see
[22:21] RoboTeddy: test: I haven't done it with node, but I have with other event-based web servers
[22:21] test: such as?
[22:21] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: Wouldn't standard file I/O be blocking?
[22:21] RoboTeddy: test: gevent
[22:21] test: im intrigued because my company is planning to have a nodejs app in production soon
[22:21] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: yeah, thats the problem, it would have to be done at compilation time

[22:23] Me1000 has joined the channel
[22:23] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: Hm. I may just look into how express does partial() and duplicate that but without any parsing...
[22:23] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: partial() is a "runtime" thing
[22:24] willwhite has joined the channel
[22:24] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: but since those are all from within express
[22:24] tjholowaychuk: the paths can be relative to whatever the settings are

[22:24] RoboTeddy: test: I'm not familiar with it
[22:24] tjholowaychuk: if jade had it's own IO helper things you would need to shove some settings at it
[22:24] tjholowaychuk: just gets dirty IMO
[22:24] test: oh okay - no worries
[22:24] hunterloftis: test: you can check out the docs. Cluster is easy. It basically creates workers for your app, based on your machine's cores.
[22:25] test: sounds cool hunter 
[22:25] test: do you use it?
[22:25] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: Yeah but it's also not pretty to put stuff like loading inline JS into the controller :/

[22:26] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: btw, good job on that, because when we dropped cluster in to replace fugue our CPU usage dropped noticeably. Jim's writing a blog post about it.
[22:26] techwraith: test: I don't use it
[22:26] techwraith: but I've written something VERY similar
[22:26] hunterloftis: test: there aren't a lot of cons. It needed to be written. Everybody uses some solution for multiple process work.

[22:28] hunterloftis: test: amongst other things (like reviving dead workers) yes
[22:29] tjholowaychuk: test: it has plugins to extend functionality like this https://github.com/visionmedia/cluster-live
[22:29] tjholowaychuk: for example
[22:29] test: reviving dead workers ? - sorry what do you mean?
[22:29] tjholowaychuk: (screenshot at the bottom)
[22:29] hunterloftis: test: Like when a process errors out and dies, it will be restarted
[22:29] test: :hunter : wow cheers this looks awesome !
[22:30] test: ahh so if my node servers crashes it will restart itself ??
[22:30] hunterloftis: test: If you're just starting writing apps with node my first suggestion would be to keep everything 100% stateless within your app, and rely on external services (redis, mongo, whatever) for state

[22:37] techwraith: test: Then yes, it will help
[22:37] test: awesome sounds brilliant
[22:37] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: text blocks have been around for a long time

[22:37] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: not sure what you mean
[22:38] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: I guess I mean, I could just drop the .js into a jade partial inside of a text block
[22:39] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: what's wrong with script() :p
[22:39] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: the last time I used script() I had to prefix each line with |

[23:13] JimBastard: tjholowaychuk: maybe when you are the #5 ranked hacker on github it isnt
[23:13] tauren: JimBastard: what's the much better solution?
[23:13] JimBastard: tauren: keep you eyes posted on NodeConf
[23:14] JimBastard: jbomb: thats not really a DB question, its a async programming question
[23:14] JimBastard: jbomb: you got a gist i can look at?
[23:14] jbomb: JimBastard: Sure, I can put an example together. You are right, it isn't specifically related to DB, just async in general.

[23:15] JimBastard: npm install jitsu
[23:15] tauren: JimBastard: what's attractive to me about CloudFoundry is that my primary app is built in Java/Spring/Hibernate, but we are moving more and more toward a JS frontend with REST backend, and have decided node.js is the right direction to move.

[23:21] JimBastard: we need to have a chat
[23:21] JimBastard: you've got problems
[23:21] jbomb: Yes, I know.
[23:21] jbomb: Hence, I came here.
[23:21] jbomb: I know this is wrong.
[23:21] SubStack: jbomb: so um
[23:21] JimBastard: good first step! you've got the wrong idea here
[23:21] SubStack: getLastName(name, cb)
[23:21] JimBastard: you arent coding for JavaScript
[23:21] JimBastard: are you a Java programmer?
[23:21] SubStack: then just cb(lastName) or more idiomatically cb(null, lastName)
[23:21] SubStack: return values and async don't mix very well
[23:22] SubStack: unless you're doing fancy chainable interfaces
[23:22] jbomb: I understand the single-thread/async style of Node...but for my particular use, I need this call to be sequential.
[23:22] raidfive has joined the channel
[23:22] SubStack: no
[23:22] SubStack: jbomb: you're just wrong I'm afraid
[23:22] JimBastard: jbomb: i dont think you need that to be "sequential"
[23:22] Draggor: ^^^^
[23:22] SubStack: async flow takes some getting used to
[23:23] JimBastard: i think you want it to be "sync", but its not going to be
[23:23] jbomb: Well one second, let me explain
[23:23] SubStack: instead of x = getLastName(myUser) just do getLastName(myUser, function (x) {})
[23:23] JimBastard: "sequential" in node.js land is when you have multiple async methods that need to execute in order
[23:23] SubStack: and in the function body you can do stuff to x
[23:23] SubStack: instead of outside
[23:23] JimBastard: you should NEVER be using while() the way you are
[23:23] JimBastard: i dont think ever
[23:23] jbomb: I want to pass this function (and others) to me template engine, so that only the templates that need to query the database call those functions.
[23:24] NuckingFuts: I'm debating learning Ruby next, because it seems like an interesting language, and I hear it actually doesn't suck.
[23:24] JimBastard: NuckingFuts: i hear brainfsck is good too
[23:24] tauren: JimBastard: i'd like to build a hybrid solution, where I self-host my app in a private cloud-like infrastructure and can scale to the public cloud if necessary. Does jitsu or nodejitsu help with the private cloud aspect at all?
[23:24] Draggor: It's slightly less functional, but has more syntax sugar to make it nice
[23:24] SubStack: jbomb: there are template engines that support async calls but I don't think you should need to do that at all
[23:24] jbomb: But within my template engine, I need the call to come back immediately, so it can be inserted into the template.
[23:24] tjholowaychuk: NuckingFuts: it sucks
[23:24] JimBastard: tauren: aye, keep your eyes on NodeConf ;-)
[23:24] tauren: ok
[23:24] NuckingFuts: I figure I ought to learn the basics at least.  It's only fair, since I also know PHP and a bit of Perl ;-)
[23:25] NuckingFuts: And Ruby is far worthier than Perl.
[23:25] SubStack: jbomb: do all your async actions and THEN use the results to render your template
[23:25] jbomb: So in the template engine, you might have <h1>getLastName()</h1>...that can't be async.
[23:25] SubStack: don't render your template first and have it do the IO itself that is silly
[23:25] tauren: JimBastard: i really, really wish I could get into NodeConf. I even live in portland.
[23:25] Draggor: NuckingFuts: actually I think perl is more functional than ruby, so I'd rate it higher
[23:25] JimBastard: tauren: you can always come to the parties?
[23:25] tjholowaychuk: NuckingFuts: it's neat for a while until you realize all the stupid syntax tricks are... stupid
[23:25] tjholowaychuk: and annoying
[23:25] tjholowaychuk: and pointless
[23:26] NuckingFuts: Perl is just plain shit though
[23:26] SubStack: jbomb: so your interface shouldn't work that way because it's helplessly incompatible with node
[23:26] NuckingFuts: tjholowaychuk: Well, I still figure it's one of those things I ought to have learned already, but ended up not learning lol
[23:26] JimBastard: jbomb: you might also benefit from using a control flow library
[23:26] tauren: JimBastard: definitely thinking about doing so
[23:26] NuckingFuts: Don't worry, nothing can replace NodeJS in my heart ;-)
[23:27] SubStack: hey now perl is fun and it has lots of good stuff
[23:27] SubStack: ruby likewise
[23:27] JimBastard: jbomb: if you are new to node and async, you might benefit from using: https://github.com/caolan/async 
[23:27] NuckingFuts: Perl is a bitch
[23:27] JimBastard: jbomb: we use that in production, its good
[23:27] SubStack: it's just crazy hard and frustrating to write async programs in both of those
[23:27] NuckingFuts: With a deformed vagina
[23:27] SubStack: now python on the other hand...
[23:27] jbomb: SubStack: JimBastard: Then how could I otherwise delay the queries to the database. I am basically building on the notion that the view should have more control of what is presents, and the controller should just make all this data available.
[23:27] NuckingFuts: SubStack: I'll keep my NodeJS. :P
[23:28] SubStack: python frustrates me so much since my usual functional flow control style is awkward as hell
[23:28] NuckingFuts: Because Python makes me wanna vomit
[23:28] NuckingFuts: So pretentious
[23:28] NuckingFuts: "dictionaries" and "lists"?  THEY'RE CALLED "HASHES" AND "ARRAYS"
[23:28] SubStack: jbomb: there are asynchronous template rendering engines you can use
[23:29] isaacs: kkaefer: no
[23:29] SubStack: if you really want partial rendering use those
[23:29] isaacs: kkaefer: but you can do --userconfig some-other-file
[23:29] brendanjerwin has joined the channel
[23:29] SubStack: jbomb: but you can't retrofit a synchronous template engine to use async without gutting all of the internals
[23:29] jbomb: SubStack: I'm writing the template engine.
[23:29] JimBastard: jbomb: based on the information i'm getting from you, i dont think your architecture is thought out well enough
[23:30] jbomb: JimBastard: In this regard, you may be right. I just got the idea to do the delayed queries, so maybe that won't fit with what I have otherwise.
[23:30] SubStack: jbomb: I recommend you build some apps with existing libs first to get a better idea of how asynchronous programming works
[23:31] JimBastard: jbomb: delays / timeouts / whileloops, these are not things you want to do in node.js land
[23:31] JimBastard: pretty much....ever...
[23:31] SubStack: truth
[23:31] NuckingFuts: Has anyone else started to think that too many people have their heads in the cloud now, and there's gonna be a big lashback soon?
[23:31] JimBastard: obviously there is a time a place for such things...
[23:31] NuckingFuts: Oh food fuck  that
[23:31] JimBastard: but not right now
[23:31] cloudhea2: anyone got a `cp -r` implementation in node?
[23:32] SubStack: NuckingFuts: seems like that already died down with that fibers noise that nobody uses
[23:32] mscdex: cloudhea2: looking at the modules list, there's: https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/wrench-js
[23:33] jbomb: SubStack: JimBastard: I understand. I was trying to do a synchronous idea, and it just doesn't work in this space.
[23:33] JimBastard: jbomb: it doesnt sound like the "best" solution
[23:33] cloudhea2: mscdex: ty, will take a cool

[23:41] brendan^^: Hey. Total noob here. Trying to wrap my head around all the different frameworks within the Node.js space. Seems like Express is fairly popular, but I'm confused about why I should use it instead of vanilla node?
[23:42] test: brendad - i use express
[23:42] test: very good
[23:42] test: *brendan
[23:42] kersny has joined the channel
[23:43] brendan^^: test: What does it add on top of Node.js that makes it worth using?

[23:45] brendan^^: test:  Trying to build a webapp that people can type in content. The content gets saved to the server and is later retrievable via permalink.
[23:45] test: righto
[23:45] brendan^^: Decent use case for Node/Express?
[23:46] test: possibly
[23:47] springmeyer_ has joined the channel
[23:47] test: have you checked out jade too?
[23:47] test: jade and express together
[23:47] brendan^^: Yeah, I'm not crazy about to be honest
[23:47] davidwalsh has joined the channel
[23:47] test: jade -> templates (i.e views)
[23:47] guybrush: brendan^^: i think its like with everything else.. you want to do your own bodyparser/routing/templates/and other stuff - just do it, otherwise use something like express :)
[23:47] test: express controller
[23:48] test: defo use express
[23:48] test: has expresso too
[23:48] Bwen: mscdex: thx again for pointing me to "require.cache" exactly what I want to clear. Works perfectly now
[23:48] guybrush: brendan^^: the next thing you will think of is, do i have to use a flow-control-library? no you dont have to but you can! :)
[23:49] brendan^^: guybrush threepwood? mighty pirate?
[23:49] guybrush: thats true
[23:49] test: control flow library???
[23:49] test: huh?
[23:49] brendan^^: sigh. best game ever.
[23:49] xiagox has joined the channel
[23:49] guybrush: test: like step of seq or others
[23:49] mscdex: oh come on, don't hate on DOTT now
[23:49] guybrush: /of/or/
[23:49] mscdex: ;)
[23:49] test: why use a lib for that?
[23:49] guybrush: why not?
[23:50] brendan^^: DOTT is the shit, but man, it doesnt get any better than MI
[23:50] test: dont understand sorry
[23:50] test: what would it give you?
[23:50] guybrush: async flow control :D
[23:50] test: examples?
[23:50] guybrush: less indentation and stuff :)
[23:50] tjholowaychuk: brendan^^ that answer is simple, use node first, then use express
[23:50] tjholowaychuk: if you want to use it
[23:50] tjholowaychuk: then use it
[23:50] tjholowaychuk: :p
[23:51] test: :)
[23:51] guybrush: test: look on github for some libs, they all come with some examples
[23:51] test: ok cheers
