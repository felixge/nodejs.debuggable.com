[00:23] MrNibbles: ive mostly only used node for websocket and service esque projects so far
[00:23] Aikar: YesIDoHTML5AJAX: you asked if what your trying to do is reasonable, im answering no its not lol. if mixing PHP into the scope of a web page request is a solution to a problem, found another solution
[00:23] Aikar: find*
[00:23] Aikar: for one youd have to execute PHP as CGI
[00:23] YesIDoHTML5AJAX: Most of the view and controller will be client-side, so PHP's being synchronous isn't relevanty
[00:24] Aikar: yes it is
[00:24] Aikar: on web page request, you either do all your code in js, or you pass the request to PHP which will drastically slow your app down, you cant go back and forth
[00:24] YesIDoHTML5AJAX: xmlhttprequest() calls are used to render all dynamic parts of the page, not server-side PHP
[00:24] Aikar: so if you pass it to PHP, you cant do any work in node
[00:24] YesIDoHTML5AJAX: It won't be passed to PHP at all

[00:45] SubStack: I want a script that tells me where exactly my json is broken
[00:45] MrNibbles: johnnywengluu: not in the slightest, just that you need to learn to structure your code a bit better in node if you are struggling
[00:45] johnnywengluu: since without it im pretty lost in the async coding style djungle
[00:45] johnnywengluu: MrNibbles: yeah im doing it with async 
[00:46] johnnywengluu: and wondering how else you are going to make it
[00:46] johnnywengluu: cause all functions take callbacks .. without that one its difficult to have a good overview of what is happening

[00:46] tjholowaychuk: SubStack: me nethier lol
[00:47] tjholowaychuk: callbacks dont bother me
[00:47] SubStack: I think sync code is harder
[00:47] YesIDoHTML5AJAX: I don't get why the technology used to serve the page has any affect on whether node.js can be used to handle ajax requests. I think you guys are confused.
[00:47] tjholowaychuk: same
[00:47] YesIDoHTML5AJAX: Aikar: Did you check out my github? Not exactly a new am I? :)
[00:47] YesIDoHTML5AJAX: *newb
[00:47] SubStack: since you can be less sure about which pieces will block
[00:48] SubStack: and then you pretty much have to cobble up your own thread pool when you have slow blocking pieces
[00:48] SubStack: much harder
[00:48] Aikar: YesIDoHTML5AJAX: it doesnt, but its really silly to run apache and php as another layer just to do a mind numbing dull task of serving a page
[00:48] Aikar: why would you NOT do it under node
[00:48] YesIDoHTML5AJAX: Aikar: Okay, I was asking for theoretical purposes. I am actually using node.js right now
[00:48] p_nitsch has joined the channel
[00:48] SubStack: and then it's insane to reason about multiple instruction pointers modifying the same data structures
[00:49] Aikar: YesIDoHTML5AJAX: you didnt ask us if it was doable lol, you asked was it reasonable, which its not
[00:49] SubStack: and re-entrant functions and stacks
[00:49] YesIDoHTML5AJAX: Aikar: Which is what I wanted to know.
[00:49] SubStack: and you have to second-guess the thread scheduler if you're doing performance-intensive tasks
[00:49] SubStack: so much pain
[00:50] YesIDoHTML5AJAX: Aikar: For example, you may be working on a legacy site that is PHP-based
[00:50] YesIDoHTML5AJAX: Which is yucky because it mixes model, view, and controller together
[00:50] SubStack: MVC is overrated
[00:50] Aikar: to do php you have to make sure 1) apache is running and stays running and monitor it for problems, 2) php is installed correctly, running correctly, and monitor it for problems, and 3) make sure nodes runnining and monitor for problems. 3 things to watch vs 1 if you just use node

[00:51] YesIDoHTML5AJAX: SubStack: Why?
[00:51] perlmonkey2 has joined the channel
[00:51] SubStack: it's super nice to just have some data structures you can modify as necessary

[00:51] SubStack: MVC tends to encourage the latter
[00:51] unomi has joined the channel
[00:51] SubStack: especially threaded environments like rails
[00:51] SubStack: because doing RPC among workers or setting up shared memory is painful
[00:52] Aikar: yeah i typically dont follow the M portion of mvc, just seperate out presentation from logic, and somewhat try to keep database interaction organized, and your good to go
[00:53] Aikar: and with node you have to seperate presentation from logic, unless your into sadomasochism
[00:53] YesIDoHTML5AJAX: Aikar: What would you call that separation of concerns? Logic-Presentation?
[00:53] SubStack: I like process separation with rpc between the nodes
[00:53] YesIDoHTML5AJAX: Aikar: How do you separate it in node?
[00:53] SubStack: it's harder to cheat
[00:53] jesusabdullah: maybe view-controller?
[00:53] Aikar: view = presentation, controller = logic of what to present. in node unless you was to manually build strings of html into variables, you have to use a template engine
[00:53] SubStack: and then if you need some transient state you can just go var state = {}
[00:53] YesIDoHTML5AJAX: SubStack: A different node for the business side?
[00:53] SubStack: serializing that to a db if you like
[00:54] Aikar: which that there usually seperates your presentational code out of logic code

[00:55] SubStack: that is very unhelpful of it
[00:55] squeeks: SubStack: .. I don't get that...
[00:55] hipe: hello wat is currently the most popular unit testing f/w for node.js, according to you.
[00:56] squeeks: nodeunit?
[00:56] SubStack: hipe: that is a fact about objective reality, not an opinion
[00:56] Aikar: YesIDoHTML5AJAX: cause a model is not logic, a model is an interface to data, you need some controller to decide what model to interact with on the ajax call
[00:56] jesusabdullah: The "best" is opinion
[00:56] SubStack: thus 'according to you' doesn't agree with the former part
[00:56] hipe: :D pick one for me then i'mm sure i'll switch it out , and note i didn't say "best" i hate questions like that ;)

[00:57] YesIDoHTML5AJAX: Aikar: Yes, but the server-side controller can be generic RPC
[00:57] jesusabdullah: quite a bit

[00:58] YesIDoHTML5AJAX: <-- Computer Science PhD learning how to actually code
[00:58] jesusabdullah: Maybe it's just me
[00:58] tjholowaychuk: they all have flaws, vows is verbose and annoying, nodeunit is serial only, expresso does not support parallel/serial at the same time
[00:58] SubStack: vows makes me indent too far to the right
[00:58] SubStack: how superficial is that?
[00:58] tjholowaychuk: so setup/teardown dont really work
[00:58] YesIDoHTML5AJAX: A model could be written in node, no?
[00:59] jesusabdullah: Sure, why not?
[00:59] Aikar: YesIDoHTML5AJAX: at risk of an mvc nutjob biting me for not being perfectly right, mostly yes. a model usually represents a table or collection in a database. then sometimes you go into an ORM to represent a row/document

[01:00] Aikar: YesIDoHTML5AJAX: usually no, but you dont have to fully follow MVC, your site may not need a database and then you have the VC portion only (like my day job :P)
[01:00] tjholowaychuk: but it would work
[01:00] tjholowaychuk: SubStack: great :)
[01:00] tjholowaychuk: awesome
[01:00] jesusabdullah: tjholowaychuk: check out node-permafrost
[01:00] tjholowaychuk: where is that at
[01:00] SubStack: and node-sesame does the same trick
[01:01] jesusabdullah: orly?
[01:01] jesusabdullah: neato
[01:01] SubStack: except slightly less general-purpose
[01:01] Aikar: the main goal is seperating logic from presentation, models are just for more organization so your db interaction is also organized and when you need to update a query you know exactly where to look
[01:01] jesusabdullah: Does pf still break, substack?
[01:01] slickplaid: need to figure out how to use node-seseme with redis
[01:01] Aikar: goal is to use w/e makes the most sense though and keeps your code tidy and organized
[01:01] slickplaid: haven't taken the time to look at it
[01:01] SubStack: jesusabdullah: well you can blame the shitty database modules for that
[01:01] jesusabdullah: MAYBE I WILL
[01:01] jesusabdullah: but are they better?
[01:01] tjholowaychuk: SubStack: sesame stores on each set or something?
[01:02] SubStack: tjholowaychuk: it hooks on to sets and writes all the sets in its buffer on a process.nextTick()
[01:02] tjholowaychuk: SubStack: ah good call
[01:02] tjholowaychuk: wish we had them in v8 so I could use them for connect
[01:03] jesusabdullah: Isn't sesame connect middleware?
[01:03] SubStack: yep
[01:03] Plouj: do I have to Buffer.copy() to concatenate Buffers, or can I just do buf += anotherBuf?
[01:03] tjholowaychuk: i mean in core
[01:03] SubStack: ah
[01:03] tjholowaychuk: i dont want compiled stuff
[01:03] YesIDoHTML5AJAX: So is a table in an SQL database a model?
[01:04] tjholowaychuk: i guess on end() is not really all that different

[01:06] slickplaid: same :D
[01:07] ChrisPartridge: I forked connect and made https work, but now it obviously doesn't support http - i'm guessing your solution handles this nicely tjholowaychuk?

[01:07] tjholowaychuk: ChrisPartridge: my solution?
[01:08] ChrisPartridge: tjholowaychuk: well, when you implement https support - i'm guessing you will be able to pass either http or https to connect?
[01:08] tjholowaychuk: ChrisPartridge: yea it's still createServer()
[01:08] tjholowaychuk: just one takes options
[01:08] tjholowaychuk: and one doesnt
[01:08] tjholowaychuk: if options are passed, it will be https

[01:15] ToyotaRepublic has joined the channel
[01:16] ToyotaRepublic: Last newb question, I promise: Why isn't a relation (table) in an SQL database a model?
[01:16] SubStack: because sql sucks
[01:16] ToyotaRepublic: So a model abstracts a bit from the database relation
[01:17] zentoooo has joined the channel
[01:17] SubStack: I hate how programmers are still in 2011 writing code that conforms to how the database works instead of the database conforming to how programmers write code
[01:17] ToyotaRepublic: SubStack: I agree.
[01:18] tjholowaychuk: SubStack: is that permafrost one yours?

[01:18] tjholowaychuk: even now, I have a tiny app to write but I dont want to use mongo or anything like that
[01:18] SubStack: still a bit broken

[01:19] SubStack: with supermarket it works reasonably well

[01:20] tjholowaychuk: it uses sqlite?
[01:20] tjholowaychuk: :(
[01:20] SubStack: yeah because sqlite does all the locking and works reasonably well
[01:21] tjholowaychuk: ACTION knows what I'm building tonight
[01:21] tjholowaychuk: haha
[01:21] SubStack: build a pure-javascript key/value store that doesn't suck (as much)
[01:21] SubStack: perhaps bind bdb
[01:22] SubStack: oh snap, node-ffi would be pretty boss for that
[01:22] Aikar: i think someone started on that
[01:22] Aikar: a nodejs based db with indexing etc
[01:22] tjholowaychuk: I just want something super easy, coudlnt care less about performance in this case
[01:23] ToyotaRepublic: Is supermarket an e-commerce platform for node?
[01:23] SubStack: ToyotaRepublic: no
[01:23] SubStack: it's a key/value store bolted onto sqlite
[01:23] ToyotaRepublic: sweet

[01:41] isaacs: squeeks: no, it's a valid objection, though I disagree.  it's important to have an illusion of flexibility and developer control so that they can feel empowered.  it's also important to have packages be predictable and not so disorganized that users can't figure them out and new devs can't figureout what to do.
[01:41] isaacs: so there's a balancing act there.

[04:57] perlmonkey2: Is line 40 in this express example correct? https://github.com/visionmedia/express/blob/master/examples/blog/models/post.js
[04:58] perlmonkey2: Is that how you call a class method inside the instance?
[05:00] SubStack: that's calling an export, not a prototype method
[05:00] samcday: Hi all. Does anyone know of a library providing git api (probably via libgit2) bindings?
[05:00] samcday: Or is anybody working on one? (:
[05:00] ChrisPartridge: samcday: I saw someone mention it in the past few days
[05:00] ChrisPartridge: perhaps check the logs

[05:01] samcday: ChrisPartridge: you got it! cheers ;)
[05:01] SubStack: samcday: `npm ls git` says there's git, git-fs, github, gitter, gitweb, and npm-github-service
[05:01] SubStack: oh and tempis, a native github client
[05:02] SubStack: github and gitter claim to be github apis
[05:02] samcday: SubStack: Looking to manage a bare git repo specifically, not a github repo. 
[05:02] samcday: But sigh, I google'd and checked modules wiki on joyent/node... didn't think to check npm. Derp.
[05:02] SubStack: there's also http://search.npmjs.org/

[05:20] brianc: hai
[05:20] brianc: I have this really hard question
[05:20] brianc: it hurts my brain
[05:20] brianc: because I suck @ c++
[05:21] ncb000gt: brianc: whats up?
[05:21] brianc: I want to convert from a v8::Local<Array> full of strings into a char ** c array of strings.
[05:21] SubStack: you want Buffer::Data()
[05:21] SubStack: and Buffer::Length()
[05:21] brianc: but I wanna call something like this:
[05:21] SubStack: at least for the individual elements
[05:22] brianc: nativeFunction(['one', 'two', 'three']);
[05:22] brianc: where nativeFunction binds to a c++/node binding function
[05:22] SubStack: you can always write a javascript layer to wrap around the c++ part
[05:23] samcday: zzak: No, libgit2 is an afterthought
[05:23] zzak: :(
[05:23] brianc: I'm tring to call libpq and it takes a "const char * const *paramValues" as a parameter
[05:24] brianc: the type declaration alone blows my mind
[05:24] SubStack: brianc: node-ffi!
[05:24] SubStack: much easier than the v8 api
[05:24] samcday: zzak: I can see a few bindings using it though, so it must be fairly usable
[05:24] brianc: on the up side I haven't learned so much about programming in such a short time since I can't remember when
[05:24] SamuraiJack has joined the channel
[05:24] brianc: SubStack: oh good call! I will check out the node-ffi source
[05:25] SubStack: I mean you can just use node-ffi
[05:25] zzak: samcday: yeh ive heard really good things, great team behind it
[05:25] SubStack: like this https://github.com/substack/node-bigint 
[05:25] brianc: SubStack: problem with using node-ffi is I'm trying to write libpq -> node bindings (in ryah's own image) and think the node-ffi overhead would introduce too much overhead
[05:26] zzak: samcday: i see someone has started one too
[05:26] samcday: Where?
[05:26] zzak: https://github.com/tjfontaine/node-libgit2
[05:26] zzak: uses node-ffi too
[05:26] SubStack: brianc: bigint is pretty fast
[05:27] SubStack: all the tests run in ~1sec
[05:27] SubStack: and that includes lots of looping over ranges to ensure consistency with builtin arithmetic operators
[05:27] brianc: SubStack: I shall totally investigate just using node-ffi. It's just everything else I've done directy binding to libpq, I just suck too hard at C to convert a javascript string array into a C string array
[05:28] zzak: samcday: oh check out extension branch
[05:29] samcday:  zzak: Holy shit ffi is hot, I didn't know about it :D
[05:29] brianc: SubStack: in other news, and totally unrelated, I'm really late to the "dnode" party and it _blew my mind_ when I read the docs. Mucho congrats on that.
[05:29] zzak: :D
[05:29] iszak has joined the channel
[05:29] SubStack: haha
[05:29] SubStack: awesome
[05:29] samcday: And yeah the extension branch is getting a lot of love, gonna keep a very close eye on that.
[05:30] SubStack: the 0.6.0 docs will be far more clear

[05:31] zzak: yo dawg
[05:31] SubStack: jesusabdullah: oooh pick me pick me
[05:31] iszak: SubStack, 0.6.x is agesss away
[05:31] jesusabdullah: Awesome.
[05:31] zzak: i herd u lyke functions
[05:31] brianc: I saw a blog post about using dnode & backbone and I felt so happy inside
[05:31] jesusabdullah: Basically, I'm just trying to include javascript files
[05:31] SubStack: iszak: dnode 0.6.0
[05:31] SubStack: it's at 0.5.6 right now
[05:31] iszak: i don't even know what that is
[05:31] jesusabdullah: a la, <script src="jquery.js">
[05:31] SubStack: so not too much further away :p
[05:31] jesusabdullah: and idk the right way to do that
[05:31] SubStack: brianc: yep I saw that too!
[05:32] sleeplessinc has joined the channel
[05:32] iszak: when will they fix this damn test error
[05:32] SubStack: people who use dnode for a project tend to turn into rabid fans
[05:32] SubStack: all is going according to plan!
[05:32] brianc: SubStack: I think there's so much hotness there 
[05:32] jesusabdullah: Anyways: Yeah. If anyone can tell me how to do that in Jade...
[05:32] jesusabdullah: <_>
[05:32] brianc: SubStack: I just wanna finish up the libpq bindings, then I wanna fall in love with dnode
[05:33] SubStack: sweet!
[05:33] jesusabdullah: What's pq?
[05:33] muhqu has joined the channel
[05:33] SubStack: pkrumins and I just got burned pretty bad by dnode's recon support which I'm pretty sure nobody else is using
[05:33] brianc: libpq = postgres c client library
[05:34] SubStack: curse you node-recon!
[05:34] SubStack: 0.6.0 does away with that dependency
[05:34] iszak: SubStack, ?define dnode
[05:34] SubStack: iszak: asynchronous remote method invocation / json with functions
[05:35] SubStack: it doesn't fit very neatly into existing rpc terminology
[05:35] brianc: iszak: dnode -> the future
[05:35] iszak: that's what they said about computers.
[05:35] brianc: https://github.com/substack/dnode
[05:35] ncb000gt: brianc: i believe the java guys said that too when they implemented it
[05:35] ncb000gt: ;D
[05:36] brianc: the fact that it works in the browser is just...it's just so hot

[05:36] brianc: at one time both computers and java WERE the future
[05:36] ncb000gt: brianc: yes
[05:36] SubStack: dnode v0.6 will use browserify to bundle its browser source >:D
[05:36] jesusabdullah: IN A WORLD where JAVA was a PROPHECY of a DARK DYSTOPIA FUTURE
[05:36] brianc: browserify + a nice simple unit testing framework would be nice
[05:36] brianc: jesusabdullah: lol
[05:36] konobi: brianc: node-pg?
[05:37] samcday: Has anyone here played around with TestSwarm?
[05:37] samcday: Looks pretty sweet. Wish it was open to anyone though :<
[05:37] jesusabdullah: I've never heard of it!
[05:37] samcday: https://github.com/jeresig/testswarm/wiki
[05:37] brianc: konobi: what? 
[05:37] samcday: Prepare to have your mind blown. Like all over the walls, floor, etc.
[05:37] konobi: um... node_postgres even
[05:37] SubStack: brianc: with browserify you can just use an existing node thing for unit testing
[05:37] iszak: What do y'all say to the argument that event driven code becomes unmanageable.
[05:37] SubStack: since you can just bundle your node source up and serve it up to the browser
[05:37] brianc: SubStack: hotness
[05:38] SubStack: so you can write your tests in vows or expresso or whatevs
[05:38] brianc: SubStack: I loooove node modules which work in the browser
[05:38] SubStack: just recently got jade working with browserify ^_^
[05:38] brianc: konobi: still confuzzed..what do you mean?
[05:38] konobi: brianc: are you working with ryah's libpq bindings or your own? (https://github.com/ry/node_postgres)
[05:38] ncb000gt: samcday: i saw resig present that at the first jsconf. it's nice, and being open source and available means that you can implement it on your own servers
[05:38] SubStack: and then traverse, hashish, and seq work
[05:38] jesusabdullah: Awesome :D
[05:38] ncb000gt: so it is available for everyone
[05:38] SubStack: probably lots more but plenty are broken still
[05:38] SubStack: also jquery works, I need to mess with that more
[05:38] ncb000gt: just requires a bit of setup on your end
[05:38] ncb000gt: :)
[05:38] jesusabdullah: Why don't they work as-is?
[05:39] brianc: konobi: https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/tree/libpq 
[05:39] SubStack: jesusabdullah: because bundling is hard
[05:39] samcday: ncb000gt: Yeah I know, but getting enough clients to connect kinda defeats the purpose of not using something like Selenium
[05:39] brianc: konobi: I started out by copying ryah, but with way more tests
[05:39] SubStack: also there are plenty of modules that require('net') or whatever
[05:39] SubStack: I don't have emulators for those yet

[05:39] konobi: brianc: cool
[05:40] brianc: konobi: the libpq bindings aren't really usable yet, but I want to run most of the same 'javascript' tests against the libpq interface when it's finished.  Ruby has "pg" and "pg-pure."  I want something similar with node-postgres so you can use the native bindings or a pure javascript version if you can't/wont bind to libpq
[05:40] Jourkey has joined the channel
[05:41] brianc: SubStack: what about "require('assert')"?
[05:41] iszak: mean while v8cgi has PostreSQL support
[05:41] konobi: brianc: had a look at node-ctype? really sweet interface for dealing with binary data
[05:41] brianc: konobi: I'm thinking "require('pg/native')" and "require('pg/pure')"
[05:42] matyr has joined the channel
[05:42] brianc: iszak: wat?
[05:42] SubStack: brianc: it's just a matter of adding stuff to builtins/
[05:42] iszak: brianc, you read me.
[05:42] konobi: brianc: try native first, then fall back to pure =0)
[05:42] brianc: iszak: dunno what v8cgi is
[05:42] iszak: check it
[05:43] brianc: iszak: wil do!

[05:48] zzak: heroine is pretty popular too in some circles
[05:48] brianc: konobi: what's a pile of garbage? also: can I get a link to 'node-cytpe'? I can't find it on googles

[05:51] brianc: i bookmarking all this for tomorrow's readings
[05:51] brianc: i have to sleep soon soon
[05:51] konobi: SubStack: should be a bunch of updates coming up for node-ctype in the next while based on my feedback
[05:51] SubStack: konobi: I do think the struct idea could go somewhere
[05:52] SubStack: like plugins for parsing
[05:52] saikat_ has joined the channel
[05:52] SubStack: but so many binary parsers need looping
[05:52] konobi: i got all of DNS query/response done in a single declaration last night
[05:52] SubStack: or worse, terminal token processing
[05:52] SubStack: shudder
[05:52] konobi: including looping

[05:53] gagaforgaga has joined the channel
[05:53] SubStack: konobi: what about buffer boundary conditions?
[05:53] konobi: SubStack: it's all contained in the packet
[05:54] konobi: so you can declare lengths based on information that was parsed earlier
[05:54] SubStack: konobi: what I mean is, what if you need to read the next 100 bytes but you get 20, then 30, then 200
[05:54] konobi: including multiple structs in a row, etc.
[05:55] konobi: SubStack: ah... hhhmmm...

[05:58] brianc: oh I think I've writen some of that before
[05:58] samcday: Dude
[05:58] samcday: What's retarded is, JS treats a number like a signed 32 as soon as you use | or << >>

[06:00] bluesnoop has joined the channel
[06:01] brianc: I did a really quick benchmark of libpq bindings versus pure node postgres communcation.  Node seems super fast so far.  Pure node query: .6 ms.  Libpq query: .4ms.  Not bad so far.
[06:02] andrewfff has joined the channel
[06:03] iszak: brianc, what type of query was that?
[06:04] Apes has joined the channel
[06:06] brianc: iszak: a simple "select 1" query...not really a good benchmark yet. heven't got the libpq bindings in a good place yet for hardcore benchmarks
[06:07] iszak: get back to me when you do joins, transactions, and the likes.
[06:08] davidascher has joined the channel
[06:08] brianc: iszak: okay...but I was thinking the benchmarks should really look for any node.js introduced overhead.  If using the libpq or the postgres network client api...eitherway if you say 'select * from whatever' postgres is gonna do the same thing
[06:08] samcday: isaacs: ping!
[06:08] Aria has joined the channel
[06:09] samcday: Anyone else having issues updating npm?
[06:09] brianc: iszak: like...if you don't have proper indexes it don't matter if you use libpq or the client network api
[06:09] iszak: here's a node.js overhead: it's an higher level language
[06:09] samcday: Shock! Horror!
[06:09] w0rse_ has joined the channel
[06:10] brianc: iszak: yeah, ofcourse
[06:10] iszak: so it's going to be hard to narrow it down when you're comparing libpq to the client network api
[06:10] iszak: i mean unless it's /really/ obvious.
[06:10] brianc: iszak: it takes some work to go from v8 javascript to v8 c++
[06:10] brianc: iszak: yeah it's kinda hard to compare
[06:11] SubStack: I would just hack something up that works first, then tune for speed if it's too slow
[06:11] brianc: iszak: but with initial tests it seems the client api isn't way slower, which speaks to node's speed
[06:12] iszak: brianc, are you sure it is not just testament to event driven design more so?
[06:12] brianc: SubStack: I did.  node-postgres completely works with the pure javascript protocol.  I wanted to provide a really well tested libpq binding alternative to ryahs since he has bigger fish to fry
[06:12] iszak: i mean what if it was blocking, how would that impact performance?
[06:12] iszak: performance => execute time
[06:12] brianc: iszak: you're totally right
[06:12] SubStack: oh cool!
[06:12] iszak: would be nice to force node.js into global synchronous mode.
[06:13] jesusabdullah: >_<
[06:13] muk_mb: lol!
[06:13] brianc: SubStack: what it want is this "require('pg/native')" and "require('pg/pure')" return the same API. one uses C bindings, one is done w/ node.js networking
[06:13] iszak: I'm serious both of you.
[06:14] iszak: brianc, is that being executed on trunk?
[06:14] brianc: iszak: no, is on the 'libpq' branch
[06:14] iszak: or "master".
[06:14] iszak: brianc, no I mean on node.js master
[06:15] brianc: iszak: oh I'm confused about what you're asking is benig executed on the master branch.
[06:15] iszak: is it being executed on node.js's master branch is what I'm asking
[06:15] brianc: iszak: I have 0 commits into the node source and only a passing understanding of c++. 
[06:15] brianc: :)
[06:16] iszak: reason I'm curious is because could the performance not be crankshaft compiling the javascript and then execute it which gives it the near C I dare say C++ Speed.
[06:16] malkomalko has joined the channel
[06:16] brianc: iszak: oh, no, it was 4.0 branch benchmarked
[06:16] iszak: I do believe that uses crankshaft?
[06:17] brianc: iszak: but if it matters, back to 0.2.4 node-postgres can execute a simple query round-trip in about .4 milliseconds
[06:18] brianc: iszak: really haven't finished the libpq bindings so it's hard to compare libpq versus pure node performance 
[06:18] iszak: brianc, you're execute it multiple times and taking an average, right?
[06:18] brianc: iszak: only did a very very premature test today
[06:18] konobi: joins, etc should make a difference... you'll start to notice benchmark differences on large datasets being returned, etc.
[06:19] iszak: brianc, well I look forward to your white paper :)
[06:19] Viriix has joined the channel
[06:19] iszak: you've also got to rule out the database being the bottleneck
[06:19] iszak: not so much bottleneck as the decreased performance factor

[06:20] brianc: the benchmarks are in the repository
[06:20] iszak: brianc, liking linode so far? I recently switched.
[06:20] brianc: like it so far for sure

I cannot wait to see what you've come up with.  Also, if it matters, I tried to keep the API very close to node-mysql so hopefully incorporating node-mysql will be an easy win

[06:25] iszak: brianc, do you know if the CPU graph is for the whole node or just your slice?
[06:25] malkomalko: Model.find({ 'age.gt': 21, 'name.in': ['tom','dick','harry'] }, { limit: 25, order: ['name', '-age'], only: ['name','age'] }, callback)
[06:25] malkomalko: looks something like that, and works really well
[06:25] brianc: malkomalko: regardless of all of that...let let me know when it's released. I'd love to see it
[06:25] ion- has joined the channel
[06:26] iszak: malkomalko, how do I specify if it's ascending or descending?
[06:26] brianc: malkomalko: nice nice nice
[06:26] iszak: ohh I see
[06:26] iszak: malkomalko, that is quite nice
[06:26] malkomalko: - in front of field name
[06:26] iszak: you should implement + too
[06:26] andrewff1 has joined the channel
[06:26] malkomalko: sure, would be easy enough, both + and - are not valid sql field names
[06:26] iszak: indeed they're not
[06:26] iszak: if string[0] === "-"
[06:27] malkomalko: we have pretty much every operator covered.. here let me show a gist of my statements test
[06:27] malkomalko: one sec
[06:27] iszak: we need an abstract database library and common method names for the databases.
[06:28] brianc: malkomalko: I'm working on libpq bindings (loosly based on ryah's bindings)but the interface should be transparent to the pure javascript bindigns so that's a win for everyone
[06:28] malkomalko: I'd like to make it really general so that it can plug in to any sql driver
[06:28] iszak: we need a joyent framework which cherry picks the best modules
[06:28] brianc: totally
[06:29] iszak: it would help kick start people off into node.js having a node.js backed framework with all the libraries they need on demand.
[06:29] iszak: not having to worry about npm or whether the framework they're using with stop being maintained
[06:30] malkomalko: https://gist.github.com/408b232dfbfc4d68aeac
[06:30] SubStack: I like the structured anarchy that happens now
[06:30] SubStack: npm ratings would be nice though
[06:30] SubStack: and automated compatability version matrix generation
[06:30] iszak: i like my idea better.
[06:31] brianc: I must sleep
[06:31] SubStack: I'm not sure how a framework would work as a collection of cherry-picked npm packages
[06:31] jesusabdullah: npm, I believe, has joyent support now
[06:32] jesusabdullah: at least, isaacs works for them
[06:32] brianc: have to be AT work in 8 hours. hopefully tomorrow I figure out the ['one', 'two', 'three'] to C++ conversion y'all helped me with tonight. :) G'night
[06:32] malkomalko: night
[06:35] iszak: brianc, love linode's migration
[06:36] iszak: just migrating my site to 756

[15:40] Jourkey: ugh, i need to put together 2 images and make a new img
[15:40] Jourkey: what do i use?

[15:41] Bonuspunkt: mspaint?
[15:41] bingomanatee: PHP 
[15:41] shaver: canvas can do that, yes
[15:41] Jourkey: on the server

[15:41] Jourkey: ?
[15:41] Aikar: gd bindings for node would be nice

[15:44] Dreamer3 has joined the channel
[15:44] Aikar: saschagehlich: i dont believe anything major changed from 0.3.6, just update. .2 -> .3 was the big changes, so if your on .3.6 you already got that stuff fixed
[15:45] saschagehlich: Aikar: okay, I'll give it a try
[15:45] Aikar: .4 is "a finalized version of .3"
[15:45] Aikar: ie the api is no longer going to change in .4 (not until .5)
[15:45] saschagehlich: okay great
[15:45] Aikar: .4 added a new critical module loading system
[15:45] Aikar: which npm uses now
[15:46] Dreamer3 has joined the channel
[15:46] Jourkey: ugh canvas sucks
[15:46] saschagehlich: Jourkey: why?
[15:47] Aikar: i think im gonna end up using a mix of canvas and SVG. SVG for UI, canvas for fast moving 2d elements, and overlay SVG on top of canvas
[15:47] Jourkey: because you have to repaint everything all the time
[15:47] squeeks: DUDE YOU SHOULD TOTALLY USE VRML
[15:47] shaver: you don't have to repaint everything all the time
[15:47] shaver: canvas is retained mode
[15:48] shaver: and you can easily retain distinct layers in different canvases
[15:48] Aikar: squeeks: well if Raphael.JS has some nice features by time im doing ui work, that will fallback to VML on IE<9 :P
[15:48] Aikar: ill prolly still use raphael regardless of features
[15:48] shaver: like a background you composite, then just drawElement it into place and draw your updated scene on it
[15:48] Aikar: the 2.0 raphael is suppose to be adding some nice stuff
[15:48] Jourkey: sure, ok

[16:13] Aikar: is node really handling up to 60k concurrent connections on a single standard instance on EC2?
[16:14] EyePulp has joined the channel
[16:14] Aikar: i know i saw some benchmarks few months ago in .1/.2 days talking about 10-15k for a single thread, so is 60k on a quad core with a preforked process looking to be realistic ?
[16:15] tim_smart: Aikar: When someone says node does 60k request per second, I would only care if all my pages were server statically.
[16:15] tim_smart: *served
[16:15] tim_smart: The real test is throwing in some network IO etc.
[16:15] Dreamer3 has joined the channel
[16:16] Aikar: well my main project im making is an mmo game so itll have constant websocket(or xhr long polling from socket.io) connections, still looks like it wont take many web servers itself to handle the data. the actual web servers in my app wont be doing game logic, theyll be routing the commands to other servers

[16:19] EyePulp: A lot of people make scaling a higher priority concern than quality of product.  Using a framework in which you're able to roll out new features quickly and debug easily is more critical in the beginning than raw performance and scalability.  Just saying... =)

[16:21] Aikar: EyePulp: well i consider servers not lagging a critical aspect of quality of product :P ive already got my design in place for scalability, i was just wanting to think about #'s to know what to expect money wise of what kind of hardware ill need
[16:21] bingomanatee: Model.query = function (query, options, callback, onExecute)
[16:21] bingomanatee: what is the difference between callback and onExecute?
[16:21] Aikar: at product launch itll def be extremely low though
[16:22] Dreamer3 has joined the channel
[16:22] Aikar: so i can prolly get away with 1 web and 1 app server on 1 box to start and db on its own, then as load increases move app to a seperate box
[16:23] softdrink: Aikar:  this is why i like amazon's ec2 for prototyping :)
[16:23] Aikar: softdrink: amazon ec2 is actually more expensive than my current hosting
[16:23] kristsk: wont db will bottleneck 1st?
[16:24] softdrink: but you can spin up loads of machines to test things out, then shut them down and only pay for that little bit of run time

[16:27] Dreamer3 has joined the channel
[16:27] Aikar: load avg stays around 1
[16:28] softdrink: hehe nice
[16:28] Aikar: softdrink: but yeah for testing multiple servers in a cluster cloud is useful for that
[16:28] briznad has joined the channel
[16:28] Aikar: but my host is rolling out a cloud beta which i llike better than amazons and its cheaper

[16:28] Aikar: http://www.serverloft.com/cloud/demo.php
[16:29] Aikar: softdrink: but i can technically also do that on my local box with VMs :P

[16:29] matyr_ has joined the channel
[16:30] softdrink: quick poll: what's everyone using for inline documentation -> html?
[16:30] Aikar: a nice thing serverloft provides is being able to scale up and down a single instance at will to your own requested #s. thats one thing i dont like about amazon. you got their server templates (micro. standard, large etcC) and thats your choice of CPU/mem levels

[16:32] kawaz_air has joined the channel
[16:32] Aikar: ill be using mongo, so soon as db load starts to become an issue can simply throw another server into its cluster and itll even the load out. mongos horizontal scaling capabilities rock. 
[16:32] mmattozzi has left the channel
[16:33] mmattozzi has joined the channel
[16:33] sholmes: Aikar: how do you manage two separate DB servers in your app?
[16:33] Aikar: sholmes: thats al lhandled by mongo
[16:33] Aikar: mongo has made scaling and sharding so painless
[16:33] Aikar: go read up on it on mongo site
[16:33] sholmes: Aikar: oh cool. Does MySQL do something similar?
[16:34] Aikar: nope
[16:34] Aikar: you gotta put that logic in your app
[16:34] Dreamer3 has joined the channel
[16:34] Aikar: when you throw a new server into mongo cluster, the cluster will automatically reallocate data from 1 server to another to even it out
[16:34] sholmes: How would you ever do that? How do these sites that use mysql do it?
[16:35] Aikar: and if it detects one cluster is receiving more load than others, itll automatically move some of the heavy use documents to other clusters to keep the load even
[16:35] Pesch has joined the channel
[16:35] Aikar: if it detects one server*
[16:36] sprout has joined the channel
[16:36] Aikar: sholmes: i think it really depends on your data. like you may seperate out a user table so users a-m are on server 1 and n-z are on 2.
[16:36] Aikar: (for mysql)
[16:36] m14t has joined the channel
[16:37] Aikar: then you query if your looking up user bob, you query 1, if nancy, query 2
[16:37] Dreamer3 has joined the channel
[16:37] sholmes: Aikar: Oh, that's weird.
[16:37] Aikar: mongo just handles all that logic and data shifting stuff for you
[16:37] sholmes: Does mongo do this at any cost?
[16:38] Aikar: so if you send a query to server 1, and it knows the data it needs is on server 2, itll go get the data fro mserver 2 and itll essentially act as a proxy
[16:38] Aikar: no real cost other than the cost of a proxy/load balancer type load
[16:38] losing has joined the channel
[16:38] Aikar: and that proxy server usually runs on localhost
[16:38] Aikar: and does the 'where do i need to go to get this data', then gets the data from the proper servers
[16:39] sholmes: So you can keep adding servers to the cluster and mongo will automatically scale accross them?
[16:39] Aikar: the sharding docs on mongo site details all of that. its really nice
[16:39] Aikar: yep
[16:39] Aikar: itll move the data for you too
[16:39] Aikar: itll constantly be moving data around to keep load even
[16:39] Dreamer3 has joined the channel
[16:39] jetienne has joined the channel
[16:40] Aikar: so if you get 3000 request to anne, 3000 to bob, and 100 to nancy, it may move bob to a diff server so your 2 heavy requests go to diff servers
[16:40] sholmes: Hmm, sounds like it could become corruptable. How's the integrety of mongo?
[16:40] Aikar: im not qualified to answer that lol
[16:40] Aikar: but mongo is memory based
[16:40] jan____ has joined the channel
[16:40] sholmes: haha, oh.
[16:40] Aikar: so if it crashes, and you didnt do a 'safe write' you can lose data
[16:40] sholmes: Wait, mongo isn't persistent?
[16:41] Aikar: now if your data is important, you can do a safe write
[16:41] Aikar: it flushes to disk every 60s unless you specify safe
[16:41] eresair has joined the channel
[16:41] Aikar: then it wont return until the data is on disk
[16:41] dguttman has joined the channel
[16:41] Aikar: so you can force a disk write for stuff thats really important
[16:41] Aikar: ie user updates
[16:41] Dreamer3 has joined the channel
[16:42] Aikar: and stuff like updating position in a game, you dont need a disk write. so its a big performance obost
[16:42] Aikar: boost*
[16:42] sholmes: That's weird that it will hold it in memory like that. Why does it do this?
[16:42] Aikar: performance
[16:42] Aikar: mongodb is extremely fast
[16:42] sholmes: Oh I see.
[16:42] Aikar: you dont do any querying from disk
[16:43] pifantastic_ has joined the channel

[16:43] ianward has joined the channel
[16:44] Aikar: theres alot of use cases where a 60 sec data loss isnt a big deal, and that gives you the power as the developer/user to dictate wether or not your data needs to be wrote to disk instantly
[16:44] Dreamer3 has joined the channel
[16:44] Aikar: and yeah itll slow down your write (but in node everythings async anyways so its not blocking your app...) but reads will still be all mem

[16:47] tylerstalder has joined the channel

[16:48] sholmes: Aikar: if the data is on disk doesn't that slow down the read as well?
[16:48] Dreamer3 has joined the channel
[16:48] Aikar: its not READING from there, the disk is really only used if the server has to be restarted to sync the memory back up
[16:49] Aikar: its a backup :P
[16:49] sholmes: Wait, so you're saying all the queriable data is held in memory? O.o
[16:50] Aikar: yes
[16:50] sholmes: That sounds a bit crazy.
[16:50] sholmes: if you have 100GB of data, you'd need that in memory.
[16:50] Aikar: if your data is like 30gb, you can have like 4 8gb servers with the data sharded over them
[16:50] Dreamer3 has joined the channel
[16:51] Aikar: if your data is 100gb, your gonna have quite a few servers
[16:51] Aikar: it may take some beefier hardware, but your talking serious performance improvements

[16:52] luke` has joined the channel
[16:52] sholmes: Aikar: it seems odd that a database would all be held in memory.
[16:53] Aikar: sholmes: really depends on what kind of data your storing. "choose the best tool for the job" :)
[16:53] sholmes: So mongo isn't for all DB needs.
[16:53] Aikar: if you got small data sizes but heavy read/writes, mongo may do a hell alot better job for you
[16:53] bingomanatee: sholmes: there is a myth that mongo keeps all its data in memory - this is only partly true. Mongo CAN te set to block until it writes to disk - in fact it can be set to block until it has made writes to several replicated servers .
[16:53] Aikar: no tool does everything
[16:53] luke`_ has joined the channel
[16:53] Aikar: bingomanatee: yeah already told him that lol
[16:53] stonecobra has joined the channel
[16:54] bingomanatee: "Thats what she said..... "
[16:54] Aikar: and bingomanatee it does keep it all in memory, but keeps a COPY on disk that it flushes to disk, to use for restoration purposes if it goes down
[16:55] Aikar: if used correctly, mongo can do your job. and sholmes if your storing large data sets you could look into diff approaches
[16:55] sholmes: So what woulnd't I want to use MongoDB for?
[16:55] tjholowaychuk has joined the channel
[16:55] Aikar: sholmes: you can use "attachments"  coupled with nginx to attach large data sets with and that wouldnt be in memory
[16:55] sholmes: The kind of data I'm storing now in MySQL, is user data, post data, etc.
[16:56] Aikar: prolly would be perfect for mongo
[16:56] Aikar: however for stuff like old post you could see it as wasteful
[16:56] Aikar: since its rarely accessed
[16:56] sholmes: but what wouldn't be perfect for mongo?
[16:56] bingomanatee: mind if I interject?
[16:56] sholmes: Aikar: actualy the posts data is accessed quite frequently
[16:56] Aikar: storing large datasets of stuff, i dunno really. im not an expert lol :(

[16:57] losing has joined the channel
[16:57] brianmario has joined the channel
[16:57] bingomanatee: There are three reasons to use MongoDB:
[16:57] sholmes: Aikar: yes you are.
[16:57] mmattozzi: sholmes: I would avoid using mongodb to store nuclear launch codes
[16:57] Aikar: haha
[16:57] sholmes: mmattozzi: so your saying it's unstable..
[16:57] bingomanatee: 1: you want a managed sharding and replication setup and don't want to hire a DBA for a month; Mongo's builtin services allow you to scale in a reliable and consistent manner
[16:57] Aikar: "sorry mr president, we cant get you the codes, bob in accounting tripped on the power cord to the mongo server"
[16:58] bingomanatee: 2: you have deeply nested data and don't want to continuiously join and aggregate just to retrieve the same nest of data a bunch of times. 
[16:59] Dreamer3 has joined the channel
[16:59] zachsmith: you'd only lose your launch codes saved or changed within the last 60 seconds
[16:59] Aikar: 3) to hack the gibson.
[16:59] pair has joined the channel
[16:59] bingomanatee: 3: You want memory resident speeds for large clumps of data. While MemcacheD does give you that (and so does Redis for example) Mongo gives you the ability to map/reduce over several servers' memory cache therefore vastly expanding
[17:00] mmattozzi: you can certainly improve performance by tossing transactional writes out the window 
[17:00] bingomanatee: the amount of memory you can have available for rapid response to your queries. 
[17:00] rpflo has joined the channel
[17:01] kwik101 has joined the channel
[17:01] sholmes: ACTION is cold
[17:01] bingomanatee: 4: You want to store heterogeneous data (that is data whose type, fields, etc. vary with context) without having to define a rigid orthogonal query in serveral tables and munge them together. 
[17:01] Aikar: i agree with what bingo said those are very good reasons to use mongo
[17:01] sholmes: bingomanatee: you only said three things.
[17:01] kristsk: 4 is new 3.
[17:01] bingomanatee: ACTION can't count
[17:01] sholmes: fuck 4
[17:02] Aikar: but id say typically, for a "Website database", mongo is CAPABLE of doing w/e you need to do your job. but the questions start to arise, does it make your job harder, could it be easier in another system.
[17:02] bingomanatee: for example I was storing security data - sometimes it was an email message, some times it was in other forms that I can't talk about, but they were all "Security Events". 
[17:02] Utkarsh has joined the channel
[17:02] sholmes: bingomanatee: that's odd, you must be one hella programmer who can't count.
[17:02] bingomanatee: I didn't want to splurge them over five or six different tables becuase there weere a lot of things that the different formats have in common. 
[17:02] bingomanatee: ACTION makes computers count for him
[17:03] Dreamer3 has joined the channel
[17:03] Aikar: relational data can start to become a pain in mongo cause you have to join the data on your app code. now sometimes you can redesign how you store your data to be all in 1 document instead of multiple collections thats all relational, but it really depends on your needs
[17:03] bingomanatee: So I created a single events colletion and put the heterogeneous data in a subdocument while keepine the common data (which client the event related to, what server it was found on) in root. 
[17:03] Aikar: if 1 document starts to become extremely huge, you can start to lose some performance benefits of the sharding
[17:03] bingomanatee: Inheritance patterns are tough to model in SQL - easy to model in Mongo. 
[17:04] bingomanatee: Thats what GridFS is for :D
[17:04] sholmes: bingomanatee: you mean heirachical data?
[17:04] bingomanatee: sure.
[17:04] bingomanatee: Mongo stores in JSON.

[17:05] bingomanatee: There are caveats, but its basically true. 
[17:05] Aikar: sholmes: it really boils down to find out what your projects needs are, do some study to see how you would lay the data out into mongo, how youd lay it out into another system, whats the performance of each, how easy is to interact with each, and make a judgement on which will overall give you a compromise between ease of use and performance etc
[17:05] bingomanatee: I don't think you can out-simple JSON. Until someone makes a YAML repository :D
[17:06] Aikar: i personally wil lbe trying to model my data to be more effecient in mongo from now on :p
[17:06] dyer: Hello, I have a question question on Faye... I am totally new to Node and I am trying to log messages that come thru the faye server to a flat file for now... I have gotten this far ( http://gist.github.com/c7e948fba38997c9ed77 ) but its logging ([object object]) and I seem to be unable to call "toString()) on the object.... am I missing something really simple here?

[17:06] bingomanatee: Data best NOT stored in Mongo :
[17:07] Aikar: brb lunch (5 mins i just gotta run downstairs :P)
[17:07] Dreamer3 has joined the channel
[17:08] bingomanatee: If you have a table that you LIKE to be flat and doesn't really have joins and you DO want to enforce rigid field type and isn't all that big you won't see a whole lot of gain by bringing it into Mongo and you will have to enforce type integrity at the application level. 
[17:08] patcito has joined the channel
[17:08] sholmes: bingomanatee: so mongo doesn't do types or relational stuff.
[17:09] bingomanatee: If your data is so deeply networked that it doesn't fit into a natural heirarchy, the graph-based nature of SQL might still be more effective. 
[17:09] bingomanatee: No and not really respectively.

[17:09] jetienne: joyent got japanese link ? or their cto is humurous ?
[17:09] bingomanatee: You can embed document IDs in other documents and do nested queries but it does not have any join system by its nature.

[17:11] jetienne: squeeks: ?
[17:11] bingomanatee: you can kind of "bake" a relationship into a document store with map/reduce but effectively if you want to keep data in a nondeterministic network, SQL is still a good call. 
[17:11] losing has joined the channel
[17:11] squeeks: "I don't think that's a problem"
[17:11] bingomanatee: However I'd suggest that storing your data in SQL and baking queries in Mongo would give you much better performance.

[17:11] sholmes: are there guys out there that do just database stuff, that I could hire. ;P
[17:11] Aikar: sholmes: mongo is based on a document storage model. so yeah, its not relational at all
[17:12] bingomanatee: I can be hired.

[17:22] bingomanatee: I was inhouse marketing - created a XOOPS stack for document dissemination, reoriented their marketing campaigns to use Sugar CRM, etc. 
[17:23] tmzt: ah, so nothing with their cms
[17:23] aho has joined the channel
[17:23] tmzt: what's XOOPS?
[17:23] bingomanatee: I want to give Ruby a shot - I think it's good at the very least for rapid prototyping, but I'm hearing a lot of mixed messages about its performance.
[17:23] tmzt: something like brunch with node might work
[17:24] squeeks: bingomanatee: 1.8 had the perf issues. YARV has kind of fixed those concerns.
[17:24] bingomanatee: Its an old school object oriented framework for PHP. Its pretty dead - it was around when PHP 4 was big. Basically gave you a good modular way to develop apps without a whole lot of baggage. 
[17:24] bingomanatee: Yeah I am going to chug Ruby / RoR next month and give it a shot. 
[17:25] bingomanatee: At the very least it seems to be setting standards in REST et all.

[17:25] tmzt: python is fun, I like beautiful soup which is why I learned it
[17:26] hobs: for a second I hought you meant those were it
[17:26] tmzt: then cherrypy which is almost as nice to work with as node
[17:26] bingomanatee: Ruby, Python, and Node. You know - the big three :D
[17:26] tjholowaychuk: Node isnt a language :p
[17:26] Aikar: me going from PHP to C++ to JS has got me too accumstomed to the syntax style.. makes me not want to do stuff with like python etc lol
[17:27] tmzt: I'm trying to figure out contenteditable, there seems to be no sane way to do that cross browser
[17:27] tjholowaychuk: Aikar: yeah I agree
[17:27] tmzt: PHP isn't exactly c though
[17:27] tjholowaychuk: c++ sucks though
[17:27] tmzt: if you use the : variants
[17:27] tmzt: just use js for everything, and c for everything you can't
[17:27] tmzt: or c++ if your forced to (v8/node)
[17:28] bingomanatee: C is for pussies who can't handle assembly. 
[17:28] tjholowaychuk: even c is elegant compared to php haha
[17:28] tjholowaychuk: foo\bar\baz YAY
[17:28] tmzt: bingomanatee: machine code
[17:28] tmzt: anything over php
[17:28] tmzt: anything
[17:28] tmzt: except perl
[17:28] Aikar: tmzt: C++ has some extra stuff over php yeah but overall the syntax style is still very similar :P

[17:29] Aikar: so i did alot of deep hacking and C++ dlls to be injected into the game
[17:30] tmzt: my next paid project is supposed to be a custom front end on magento, building custom products with a designer of sorts
[17:30] Aikar: so all my C++ experience is limited to that really :/
[17:30] tmzt: I'll be using jquery/ajaxorg or something like that for the client

[17:33] Aikar: tmzt: we found ALOT of dangerous stuff in final fantasy XI... the games already had quite alot of hacks, but if what WE had was exposed, the game would be destroyed

[17:33] Aikar: http://ffxiah.com < this site directly interfaces to the games private auction house servers to download all the data off them, the creator ended up crashing the servers a few times making it

[17:36] tjholowaychuk: it shouldnt
[17:36] tjholowaychuk: only stuff in ./public
[17:36] tmzt: no, I had /
[17:36] tmzt: :)
[17:36] tjholowaychuk: oh well yeah that wil do it

[17:37] Dreamer3 has joined the channel
[17:38] tmzt: how does it detect the mime type?
[17:38] tmzt: this is getting crazy
[17:38] tmzt: maybe I should JSON.stringify(fs.readFileSync())
[17:38] tmzt: and servet that
[17:41] tmzt: it looks like it just converted the buffer to json
[17:41] tmzt: {"0":123,"1":34,"2":114,"3":101,
[17:41] tjholowaychuk: add utf8 or something tothe readfile

[17:42] tmzt: okay, but what's the syntax to serve static file with pip
[17:42] tmzt: pipe
[17:42] bingomanatee: you have to toString() buffers. 
[17:42] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: something like fs.createReadStream(path).pipe(res)
[17:43] tjholowaychuk: of course that gets more complicated if you want real features
[17:43] tmzt: oops
[17:43] tmzt: it just stringified the string
[17:43] tmzt: tjholowaychuk: just mime

[17:50] bingomanatee: there are cleverer answers - but I find that just calling the initial line in cron works for me.
[17:50] bingomanatee: If you have already owned the given port it errors out harmlessly. 
[17:50] sholmes: bingomanatee: I'm not familiar with cron much. How does it work?
[17:51] bingomanatee: However you can't "hot swap" modules in node. If you want to change the codebase you have to restart. 
[17:51] bingomanatee: what is your OS?
[17:51] tmzt: missing a : this whole time
[17:51] gkatsev: try forever for node
[17:51] sholmes: i'm running cygwin/windows as localhost and ubuntu on my VPS
[17:51] bingomanatee: yeh - heard good things about that.
[17:52] Aikar: jobrodesign: i strongly recommend setting up a VM of ubuntu. youll have less headaches just running it under a VM
[17:52] bingomanatee: sounds like hes there
[17:52] jobrodesign: probably good advice
[17:52] pl6: Aikar - that's where i'm at
[17:52] Aikar: jobrodesign: ubuntu server edition is free, virtualbox is free, just run that and all wil lbe golden

[17:53] ncb000gt: but i have no experience with that
[17:53] ncb000gt: <-- linux
[17:53] bingomanatee: I would stay off cygwin. 
[17:53] Aikar: i firmly believe you should do development/testing on the platform you intend to deploy on
[17:53] gkatsev: cygwin is terrible
[17:53] ncb000gt: Aikar: absolutely
[17:53] kkaefer: anyone using http://benchmarkjs.com/?
[17:53] bingomanatee: I mean - for gods sake you can get a laptop for $400 and Ubuntu is free. 
[17:53] Aikar: so trying to test in cygwin isnt a good idea, just run vm with a linux os
[17:54] ncb000gt: bingomanatee: meh, 400 is a lot to some people, but virtualbox being free makes that easier to mit

[17:55] Aikar: then you find some cool module for node thats in C and then you go through headaches again trying to get it to run on cygwin :P
[17:55] Aikar: skip the headaches and use a linux vm lol
[17:55] sholmes: I have ubunut/virtualbox installed if that ever happens. It's just easier to pop open mintty and run node. xP
[17:56] Sebmaster: shomes: cluster doesn't work on cygwin, even tho it doesnt even use c stuff :/

[17:59] bingomanatee: cygwin causes cancer in mothers.

[18:10] Aikar: ryan: you mind if i bring my irc bot in here? it provides some useful commands like !google !math and will provide url preview/bitly shortening of every url printed. so long urls like ^ that have habbit of breaking on terminal clients, get shortened

[18:21] Aikar: google lol
[18:21] seivan: so
[18:21] Aikar: google "1 aikar in usd"
[18:21] seivan: so I guess have the DB on one server and then X servers
[18:21] Dreamer3 has joined the channel
[18:22] Aikar: seivan: theres only 64k ports on a system
[18:23] seivan: Aikar: hmm
[18:23] seivan: ehm
[18:23] seivan: does that make any sense?
[18:23] seivan: I mean the server listen on a single port, whats the for?
[18:23] Aikar: it still uses some form of an outgoing port, ever noticed in HTTP Request headers in php or so it lists the clients local port

[18:27] seivan: 1) How many connections can one machine handle (Node.js) 2)How strong can that machine be 3)How can I do some form of loadbalancing easy 4)I guess I need a separate server for the redis DB?

[18:31] seivan: haproxy :D
[18:31] Aikar: i havent tried any yet lol
[18:31] kkaefer: tjholowaychuk: is there a benchmarking framework that you can recommend?
[18:31] Aikar: im still in the early stages of my project
[18:31] kristsk: nginx will do quite nicely
[18:31] seivan: how does that work, I got a main server that balance loads to the other 4 servers?
[18:31] Aikar: yea
[18:31] tjholowaychuk: kkaefer: nope :( I used to use isaacs node-bench
[18:31] tjholowaychuk: but
[18:31] kristsk: and will server static content as well.

[18:32] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: oh :)
[18:32] tjholowaychuk: well there you go
[18:32] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: but if you wanna benchmark a server's response time, then it's not the right tool for that job
[18:32] tjholowaychuk: no no, i think we are just talking routines
[18:32] isaacs: kkaefer: use something like seige or ab
[18:32] isaacs: yeah, for microbenchmarks, it's pretty awesome.
[18:32] tjholowaychuk: he mentioned benchmark.js earlier
[18:32] tjholowaychuk: so i think that is what he is referring to
[18:32] kkaefer: isaacs: it's not for http
[18:32] Dreamer3 has joined the channel
[18:32] isaacs: most microbench setups don't do enough runs, and don't switch up the order, so what you get is not actually statistically accurate.  one outlier, and you're boned;
[18:33] kkaefer: tjholowaychuk: benchmark.js doesn't seem to support async benchmarks
[18:33] isaacs: suddenly you're rewriting all your loops backwards or some stupid crap
[18:33] tjholowaychuk: i like node-bench though it's api is nice and simple
[18:33] isaacs: node-bench is designed to rule out outliers and cold-start effects.
[18:33] tjholowaychuk: kkaefer: npm install bench, give that a try
[18:33] isaacs: but it's slow.  it does a LOT of work
[18:34] isaacs: kkaefer: npm install bench ; npm explore bench ; cd examples (poke around, read the code there)

[18:39] orospakr: Is it possible to leak memory with circular references in Javascript?  (no, I'm not asking about DOM)
[18:39] orospakr: or do things need to have a reference path back to your "root" object (your global namespace) in order to not be GC'd?
[18:40] Aikar: orospakr: something thats able to be ram must still be able to see said object
[18:40] nejucomo has joined the channel
[18:40] Aikar: ie, a local var in a closure will not gc until that closure itself gc's
[18:40] Aikar: if the code/variable is stil laccessible by some method, it wont be g/c'd
[18:41] Aikar: so yeah putting stuff into global scope is bad because the reference will stick around
[18:42] ajpiaNOU has joined the channel
[18:42] gkatsev: global scope is fairly limited for node.
[18:42] tilgovi has joined the channel
[18:42] gkatsev: or more limited than in the browser
[18:43] gkatsev: though, you could still probably get the true global scope via (function(){return this}).call(null)

[18:44] hobs: I saw an old school screencast with node.js api docs ith nice drop downs and expanding stuff, is that only for the old docs?
[18:44] orospakr: I don't think that's quite what I meant, actually. I'm just asking, if I create two javascript objects that have references to each other, and let my own reference to one of those go out of scope, what's to make them get GC'd? or will they persist forever.
[18:44] Dreamer3 has joined the channel
[18:44] orospakr: hobs, yeah, 0.2.x had docs in that style.
[18:44] orospakr: that went away in 0.3. not quite sure why.
[18:44] hobs: I just really dont love the api documentation but if im gonna complain about it I might as well remake it
[18:45] orospakr: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.2.5/api.html
[18:45] gkatsev: orospakr: an object won't be GCed as long as there is a pointer to it.
[18:45] hobs: yeah that seems much nicer
[18:45] orospakr: gkatsev, so, you're saying that I *can* leak with circular referenced islands. ah, well.  I'll have to watch for that.
[18:45] hobs: but I cant read it in fear its outdated
[18:46] orospakr: hobs, more or less compatible, but yeah, might as well not bother
[18:46] hobs: woe is me

[18:53] isaacs: kkaefer: there should be lots of lines
[18:53] kkaefer: nah, five lines of that
[18:54] isaacs: yeah, so, that's the Hz (runs / second) of the specified test.
[18:54] kkaefer: https://gist.github.com/4f6a83770229be8767c9 
[18:54] isaacs: typically you want to have more than one test, so that you can compare those numbers.
[18:54] kkaefer: ah, it's in Hz
[18:54] isaacs: kkaefer: check out the other examples there.

[20:32] seivan: tjholowaychuk: any guides on loadbalancing and node?
[20:32] tjholowaychuk: EyePulp: cool cool, will look at it pretty soon here once im done with connect
[20:32] tjholowaychuk: seivan: use cluster :)
[20:32] tjholowaychuk: the kernel will load balance for you
[20:32] EyePulp: I dug into it for a bit, but couldn't figure out how to hack around it.
[20:32] tjholowaychuk: EyePulp: yeah I dont have test cov for that I must have missed that use-case
[20:32] seivan: tjholowaychuk: Sure fork over a html5 screencast on it, as I know you got a flash one :D (j/k unless you wanna)
[20:32] tjholowaychuk: ill get it working
[20:33] tjholowaychuk: seivan: haha :) soon soon, I got that screenflow thing
[20:33] tjholowaychuk: no more restricted 5 minutes grrr
[20:33] EyePulp: tjholowaychuk: no worries - I'm chomping at the bit to get some greater control over my production node deployment, but I can keep working on the app itself until then. =)
[20:33] tjholowaychuk: now i can show the world how bad i am at explaining things in full length!
[20:34] tjholowaychuk: EyePulp: cool cool :) I always just bind to an ip so I totally missed that
[20:34] seivan: tjholowaychuk: but cluster isn't for load balancing no?
[20:35] tjholowaychuk: seivan: well it does within that machine
[20:35] EyePulp: tjholowaychuk: it seems so minor - I really wanted to figure it out and issue a pull request.  some day...
[20:35] seivan: tjholowaychuk: between cores?
[20:35] tjholowaychuk: seivan: each worker accepts from the same listening socket
[20:35] tjholowaychuk: so
[20:35] tjholowaychuk: the kernel manages that
[20:35] tjholowaychuk: its automagical
[20:35] seivan: so..

[20:40] EyePulp: I'm all ears though, as it's such an odd new use for node =)
[20:40] iammerrick: EyePulp ok cool. I'll look into it :)
[20:40] seivan: tjholowaychuk: Still here? 
[20:40] seivan: What I asked for was a way
[20:40] seivan: Like, I am going to have a server for load balancing, and a DB server
[20:41] trentm has joined the channel
[20:41] seivan: How many TCP connections you think node can manage on a server?
[20:41] tjholowaychuk: seivan: really depends on the server
[20:41] tjholowaychuk: in so many ways
[20:41] seivan: Yeah I know that
[20:41] tjholowaychuk: so I cant really give you a number
[20:41] tjholowaychuk: alot
[20:41] tjholowaychuk: haha
[20:41] seivan: haha
[20:41] seivan: assume an average Ec2 slice
[20:41] bradleymeck: seivan, server dependant, on my nice home comp i can max
[20:41] minegoboom: Hello, I've never used NodeJS and am looking for assistance trying to use Etsy's StatsD (https://github.com/etsy/statsd)
[20:41] tjholowaychuk: BILLIONS
[20:41] tjholowaychuk: haha
[20:41] tjholowaychuk: jk
[20:42] iammerrick: EyePulp: Looks like the docs for Addons is really slim
[20:42] seivan: bradleymeck: what is max?
[20:42] bradleymeck: ACTION goes to look up the actual number
[20:42] seivan: But seriously been trying to get numbers now on how many connections I can keep on server
[20:42] EyePulp: minegoboom: I set that up the other day - what's your issue?
[20:42] seivan: bradleymeck: how do you test and max it?
[20:42] seivan: Anyone to benchmark socket connections?
[20:43] shaver: the c10k project has some tools, I think
[20:43] bradleymeck: cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max for your machine
[20:43] sholmes has joined the channel
[20:43] bradleymeck: basically just open up a server and have a client comp just pipe junk as echo between
[20:44] minegoboom: EyePulp: I'm probably doing this completely wrong, but I copied exampleConfig.js to config and it is erroring at "graphiteHost:" when I run "node stats.js"
[20:44] EyePulp: minegoboom: you need to have your graphite server up and running and then point to the IP/port of the graphite service
[20:44] ncb000gt: minegoboom: i doubt graphite has a server at graphite.host.com
[20:45] sirkitree has joined the channel
[20:45] EyePulp: and graphite is slightly more painful to install
[20:45] ncb000gt: minegoboom: http://graphite.wikidot.com/downloads
[20:45] minegoboom: I have a graphite server already up and running on port 2003, and switched the host to localhost
[20:45] seivan: gah
[20:45] seivan: seriously no one got a number, I was told 64k is max
[20:45] gf3 has joined the channel

[20:46] trentm has joined the channel
[20:46] seivan: ok. but it's 64k on what kind of specs?
[20:46] EyePulp: assuming there's memory to handle it all
[20:47] seivan: I mean the server parts
[20:47] ncb000gt: minegoboom: what does your config actually look like?
[20:47] minegoboom: ncb000gt: http://pastebin.com/3gjkRuYF
[20:47] seivan: Let me rephrase my question. How many connections can Node manage on  server with X memory and Y CPU (you can fill in the X and Y based on experience)
[20:48] jimt has joined the channel
[20:48] ncb000gt: minegoboom: and graphite.jubilee.tss resolves for you?

[20:49] konobi: isaacs: does 3rdEden use IRC?
[20:49] minegoboom: Graphite is setup and running (have the example-client.py running and verified in apache to be working)
[20:49] isaacs: konobi: wha'ts 3rdEden?
[20:49] minegoboom: ncb000gt: correct, internal DNS
[20:49] ncb000gt: minegoboom: i figured. :)

[20:59] minegoboom: EyePulp: What version of node are you using for StatsD?
[21:00] ncb000gt: jmar777: i just threw up a little.
[21:00] EyePulp: minegoboom: I believe I updated to master at somepoint...
[21:00] ncb000gt: ;D
[21:00] seivan: eh,..
[21:00] seivan: I'll try again
[21:00] EyePulp: minegoboom: I don't recall though
[21:00] minegoboom: EyePulp: What does your config file look like?
[21:00] ncb000gt: seivan: what do you want to know about lb?
[21:01] jmar777: ncb000gt: i know, i know. it would be kind of cool though to not have to implement different stuff for Socket.IO clients and "property WebSockets" clients
[21:01] seivan: DOES ANYONE know how many TCP connections a node server can manage, take average server
[21:01] seivan: I just want a number and the specs on the server
[21:01] seivan: that's all
[21:01] jmar777: ncb000gt: maybe we just need an abstraction layer over the two scenarios
[21:01] jmar777: seivan: depends on a lot of things. most operating systems set a max number of connections, but its configurable
[21:02] seivan: Okay
[21:02] seivan: 5?
[21:02] seivan: Is that the max?
[21:02] ncb000gt: seivan: that requires testing and as bradleymeck stated, is different for each system. write some tests to figure it out.
[21:02] seivan: or 100k ?
[21:02] jmar777: seivan: also depends on available ports, and how long you have keep-alive running, cause that blocks ports from future connections
[21:02] jmar777: seivan: unfortunately i can't help you with a real number, cause we've been struggling through the various configurations ourselves. would be interested if you find anything though :)
[21:02] ncb000gt: seivan: you're not going to find an easy answer...
[21:02] seivan: ok
[21:02] seivan: then a normal EC2 slice
[21:03] seivan: with ubuntu
[21:03] seivan: alright
[21:03] seivan: fuck it,  nevermind. I won't get any answers. 
[21:03] strmpnk has joined the channel
[21:03] jmar777: seivan: probably your initial max limit will have to do with some sort of a sysctl maxConn type setting. so maybe 128 or so?
[21:03] seivan: Regarding load balancing, tjholowaychuk left before answering. What is it for really? Why would I want to loadbalance on a single server?
[21:03] tjholowaychuk: im here
[21:03] narayan82 has joined the channel
[21:03] seivan: jmar777: that's funny, someone just told me 64k is max on a single server
[21:04] rfay_afk has joined the channel
[21:04] tjholowaychuk: seivan: because ... otherwise workers do not know who should accept
[21:04] jmar777: seivan: 128 isn't a hard limit. it can be raised
[21:04] tjholowaychuk: it's handled by the kernel, it is really effecient do not worry about it
[21:04] seivan: what?
[21:04] jmar777: seivan: but there is some theoretical "max", which, if someone said 64K, probably has to do with ports
[21:04] Plouj: where can I read up on using require in JS/node and how to write JS "modules"?
[21:04] seivan: tjholowaychuk: But isn't that retarded?
[21:04] seivan: I mean loadbalancing on a single server
[21:04] tjholowaychuk: seivan: no
[21:04] seivan: instead of multiple
[21:04] tjholowaychuk: not at all
[21:05] seivan: If you pay per usage
[21:05] seivan: How does that help if there is a limit?
[21:05] tjholowaychuk: it doesnt, but that is not the point at all
[21:05] seivan: So you just want people to use your tool, even if it doesn't help?
[21:05] ncb000gt: seivan: the way node works is through an event loop, eventually you'll fill your loop with "stuff" and will have to spread it out across multiple processes
[21:05] ncb000gt: o.0
[21:05] Sebmaster: seivan: node is a single thread/process. so if you wouldnt take a load balancer, youd need a single core, maybe dual for the os at max
[21:05] jmar777: seivan: node is single threaded, which means if you have 4 cpus, you're letting 3 of them sit idle (other than random utilizations from underlying c libs, anyway)
[21:06] tjholowaychuk: you dont get it
[21:06] seivan: tjholowaychuk: I guess not
[21:06] tjholowaychuk: seivan: it HAS to be done this way (or alternative, but this is fast) to enable each worker to accept connections from the same socket
[21:06] tjholowaychuk: its not retarded at all
[21:06] tjholowaychuk: stop being naive
[21:06] seivan: I see, so instead.. of spreading the load between different servers
[21:06] tjholowaychuk: if you dont do this, you can have only ONE process
[21:07] seivan: I just spread them.. on the same server with the same process
[21:07] seivan: different* processesS*
[21:07] seivan: I mean different physical (or vps) machines
[21:07] Sebmaster: seivan: theres a huge difference in the concept of node and for example apache
[21:07] seivan: ncb000gt: Nice explanation, thanks.
[21:07] tjholowaychuk: yes cluster does not (yet) support multiple machines
[21:07] jmar777: seivan: if you want to spread across different physical servers, you need to be looking at reverse proxies, like nginx or haproxy, for example. if you're just trying to increase single-server utilization, then something like cluster is what you want
[21:08] tjholowaychuk: even if not, you can use cluster and haproxy etc on top of multiple "clusters"
[21:08] Sebmaster: seivan: you _can_ load balance with node as on everyy other server but you *have* to load balance on a single server to utilize all your cores
[21:08] minegoboom: ncb000gt: I downgrades to 0.2.6 and tried with the same error. If I blank out the config file, it mentions a different error: http://pastebin.com/U5M5tGj5

[21:09] seivan: tjholowaychuk: sorry about earlier
[21:09] ncb000gt: minegoboom: well, i expect it would blow up if the properties aren't set correctly for the tool (it expects to have those config options set within the config file)
[21:09] seivan: Does anyone got any resource to read on this?
[21:09] tjholowaychuk: seivan: lol just try and take advice, and listen to people
[21:10] jmar777: seivan: you mean on max tcp connections? you might find that there's more literature available on OS-level tunings if you google up on older server technologies (e.g., server tuning for jetty)
[21:11] jmar777: seivan: just don't go changing stuff unless you understand it, and know why you want that change made for *node*, rather than whatever the article is for
[21:12] minegoboom: EyePulp: what does your configuration file for StatsD look like? Because if I just run var config = require('./config') or var config = require('./exampleConfig.js') it errors at the same location
[21:12] seivan: I am thinking, I need a server for redis, and I need a server for the nginx(?) load balancer to take the connection and balance out the load between the different node servers in the network.
[21:12] seivan: Am I going at this wrong?

[21:18] seivan: That seems counter-productive
[21:18] ncb000gt: -.-
[21:18] tjholowaychuk: if you want to utilize more than one core
[21:19] tjholowaychuk: then you have to
[21:19] seivan: tjholowaychuk: I see, and it won't do it by  itself?
[21:19] ncb000gt: no
[21:19] tjholowaychuk: no lol
[21:19] seivan: Why are you loling?
[21:19] deepthawtz has joined the channel
[21:19] seivan: It makes perfect sense that it would do that itself?
[21:19] tjholowaychuk: stop being naive or listen to people

[21:19] Bonuspunkt: about 10 times
[21:19] seivan: ncb000gt: I am sorry I must have missed the part where they said so
[21:19] tjholowaychuk: seivan: either you need to proxy and have N node instances of different ports, or you need something like cluster
[21:19] seivan: tjholowaychuk: I am listening but what you are saying makes no sense to me, there are questions
[21:20] seivan: tjholowaychuk: Cluster makes all the cores listen to the same port, right?
[21:20] tjholowaychuk: yes
[21:20] tjholowaychuk: cluster will work with any number of workers without any other changes
[21:20] softdrink: hrm… there doesn't seem to be a way to json encode an array that also has properties
[21:20] seivan: Can I use Cluster combined with a server-based load balancer?
[21:20] tjholowaychuk: of course
[21:20] seivan: tjholowaychuk: Does each core handle more connections?
[21:21] seivan: each core has it's own node process. For a 2 core, do I get 2x the connections?
[21:21] seivan: Or is that based on the OS itself?
[21:21] tjholowaychuk: seivan: it *should* be quite linear, so 1 core might be say 12k rps, 2 24k etc
[21:21] seivan: tjholowaychuk: Wow, 12k is low.
[21:21] seivan: I was expecting 50-60k :/
[21:21] seivan: (I am joking...)
[21:22] tjholowaychuk: ACTION leaves
[21:22] minegoboom: ncb000gt: Thank you for your patience. Staring at StatsD's stats.js enough got me to realize it isn't looking for file "config", which screwed up with the require('./config'), but requires a system argument.
[21:22] seivan: tjholowaychuk: nah :&
[21:22] seivan: tjholowaychuk: You are starting to make sense.
[21:22] minegoboom: stats node.js exampleConfig.js ran... :(

[21:23] seivan: Yeah why would you leave during that moment :D 
[21:23] seivan: does tjholowaychuk mean worker == as a process?
[21:23] jmar777: seivan: they're not the same, but each worker will have its own process
[21:24] seivan: I guess a worker is what load balances then?
[21:24] jmar777: seivan: the worker is what the request gets load balanced to. cluster will load balance, and the worker will service, the actual response
[21:24] ncb000gt: seivan: a worker is a spawned process afaik
[21:25] seivan: can you set how many workers each node process has?
[21:25] seivan: like nginx?
[21:25] ncb000gt: no idea
[21:25] ncb000gt: http://github.com/learnboost/cluster
[21:25] ncb000gt: take a look
[21:25] seivan: well I am not interested in the http calls, but just a TCP server
[21:25] seivan: Ok..
[21:26] seivan: So... 4 servers, each server running cluster
[21:26] seivan: then a fifth server for load balancing between those 4 server that then each load balances
[21:27] tjholowaychuk: seivan: it's pretty simple. the "master" process listens on the port you give it, that file descriptor is passed to N workers (defaults to the number of cpus available). each worker calls listenFD() on that fd, from then on the kernel manages the "load balancing" via the accept() syscall
[21:27] tjholowaychuk: there is no proxying involved
[21:27] seivan: cool.
[21:27] charlenopires has joined the channel
[21:27] seivan: But that's with cluster (or something similar)
[21:27] tjholowaychuk: .set('workers', n) if you want something explicit
[21:27] seivan: I can only do so much on a single server, so I am introducing NGinx into the game
[21:28] seivan: Or something else.
[21:28] tjholowaychuk: yup
[21:28] maushu has joined the channel
[21:28] seivan: When I read worker, I think of nginx workers. You spawn a process for each core, and each process has like.. 1024  workers
[21:28] seivan: Not the same concept?
[21:29] seivan: 7.5 GB memory 4 EC2 Compute Units (2 virtual cores with 2 EC2 Compute Units each)
[21:29] tjholowaychuk: a worker in cluster is a single process
[21:30] seivan: How many connections (with cluster running) would that manage do you think running default settingsm no tweaking
[21:30] tjholowaychuk: 0 at this rate
[21:30] seivan: funny guy =)

[21:31] seivan: https://github.com/davglass/spark2
[21:31] konobi: assuming you're CPU bound on one process that is
[21:31] tjholowaychuk: konobi: hes been looking at cluster already
[21:32] seivan: Seems spark was tjholowaychuk older stuff
[21:32] tjholowaychuk: but he wanted to know how many connections

[21:33] konobi: well, v8 limits your max memory anyway (2Gb) or whatever
[21:33] xastey: how can I run node as a service?
[21:33] MattAdams: What are my options for an HTTPS reverse proxy with node?  Is there anything that will support this or am I better off going with a more traditional solution such as haproxy, ngix or httpd?
[21:33] seivan: konobi: really?
[21:33] seivan: That sucks so much
[21:33] konobi: seivan: haven't seen the need to hit that level or RAM yet
[21:33] seivan: Today servers got like 64 gb or so

[22:28] seivan: bradleymeck: Yeah ok, will use redis to increment user id's then
[22:28] seivan: but how do I get the user_id
[22:28] seivan: I mean let say a new connection is established
[22:28] bradleymeck: seivan its more complicated than having incremental user ids, array push / pop etc fs things up
[22:28] EyePulp: seivan: when a connection comes in, it has a client.sessionId value - it's numeric - you can then refer back to that socket and retrieve the client using the sessionId value later on  -- socket.clients[socket_session_id]
[22:28] seivan: EyePulp: aye
[22:29] seivan: I was thinking when a connection comes in, use redis to increment, and save that in a user model with the socket. 
[22:30] EyePulp: seivan: that can work.  I use mongodb, but the same rule applies - track the client.sessionId and then you're able to look up a client and push something back to them easily.
[22:31] EyePulp: I also generate my own uuid and use that as the overall identifier of a person - earlier versions of socket.io had connections that died on me a lot, so I had to build something to paper over the dropped connections

I am working on a thing called JSHint that checks your JavaScript code and I got a feature request to support shebangs but I am not sure about it since it is not a valid construction in JavaScript.
[22:38] stagas: it's common
[22:40] antonkovalyov: stagas, I assume Node removes it before V8 parses the code?

[22:47] isaacs: EyePulp: or just `npm bundle` to install the deps in your package.json file
[22:47] isaacs: EyePulp: it's going to be the default behavior in 1.0
[22:47] EyePulp: so package.json is similar to reqs.txt
[22:47] isaacs: EyePulp: so `npm install connect` will install it in the cwd.  `npm install connect --global` will install it in /usr/local/node_modules

[22:48] EyePulp: heading that way though
[22:48] isaacs: EyePulp: but `npm bundle` installs locally, and `npm install` installs globally
[22:48] isaacs: EyePulp: in the future, `npm install` will install locally, and `npm install --global` will install globally
[22:48] isaacs: also, a lot of cleanup
[22:48] isaacs: now that we have node_modules folders, things can be less hidden, less silly.

[22:52] EyePulp: okay, so bundle puts stuff in the cwd under node_modules, and has a readable format inside that dir.  now do I make my project use that local node-modules dir without hadncoding each require? (I know this is a dumb ?)
[22:53] EyePulp: *handcoding

[22:56] jacobolus: isaacs: I'm having trouble installing npm (haven't investigated *too* closely but maybe it's something simple)
[22:57] isaacs: jacobolus: gist the output
[22:57] jacobolus: I get: Error: Cannot find module 'semver'
[22:57] isaacs: jacobolus: ok, what are you doing?
[22:57] isaacs: jacobolus: what's the command you're running?
[22:57] Me1000 has joined the channel
[22:57] jacobolus: isaacs: every way I try, but e.g. sudo node ./cli.js install npm
[22:57] isaacs: jacobolus: did you do `git submodule update --init`?
[22:58] jacobolus: I don't think so
[22:58] isaacs: there ya go :)
[22:58] jacobolus: isaacs: I grabbed a tarball
[22:58] jacobolus: in particular, this one https://github.com/isaacs/npm/zipball/v0.3.7
[22:58] isaacs: yeah, that won't work
[22:59] jacobolus: oh
[22:59] devdazed has joined the channel
[22:59] jacobolus: alright
[22:59] isaacs: if you get the git repo contents, then you have to update the submodules before it'll build
[22:59] isaacs: so you can do `git clone` and then `make install`, or you can do the curl | sh trik
[22:59] isaacs: *trick
[22:59] isaacs: read the README.md.  It explains all this stuff
[23:00] jacobolus: the curl | sh doesn't work at my current privs. I did read the readme.md :)
[23:01] jacobolus: isaacs: okay, it works
[23:01] jacobolus: thanks!

[23:01] bradleymeck: anyone have a dynamic length buffer implementation?
[23:02] SubStack: http://github.com/substack/node-buffers 
[23:02] bradleymeck: ie. if write() past .length your buffer will copy into a larger one
[23:02] SubStack: it's a slightly different interface than that to avoid too many unnecessary copies
[23:03] bradleymeck: mmm interesting

[23:06] AAA_awright: I like the node_modules but what's the deal with package.json now being meaningful to Node.js? What was wrong with symlinks/
[23:07] bradleymeck: AAA_awright, lots and lots of fs.stats 
[23:08] AAA_awright: bradleymeck: node_modules just exacerbates that
[23:11] AAA_awright: I would say if there documentation has to write out the module resolution process in pseudocode there's something larger being done wrong
