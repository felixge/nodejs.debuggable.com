[00:09] itayneeman: killing-joke: on 0.6.6, I just did "npm install dnode"
[00:09] itayneeman: and it seems to work
[00:09] killing-joke: itayneeman, which platform?
[00:09] isaacs: killing-joke: what version of npm are you using?
[00:09] itayneeman: killing-joke: OS X
[00:09] killing-joke: 1.1.0-beta-4
[00:09] itayneeman: 10.6
[00:09] kenperkins: I hate asking the same question in successive weeks, but is there any way to enable node-inspector on cluster.fork processes?
[00:10] isaacs: killing-joke: please gist the entire output.
[00:10] killing-joke: sure
[00:10] itayneeman: isaacs: I wonder if this is the same issue I reported last week
[00:10] itayneeman: kenperkins: I would imagine it has to do with whether node was started with the debug flag (with unique ports)
[00:11] kenperkins: sadly it doesn't
[00:11] itayneeman: kenperkins: you could use isaacs' suggested method of changing the PATH variable to your own script which will do that, no?
[00:11] itayneeman: That way when it forks off the new processes, it'll pick up your own copy of the node script
[00:11] itayneeman: which will add a unique port plus the debug flag
[00:11] kenperkins: cluster.fork() doesn't propogate the --debug setting from master
[00:11] itayneeman: if that makes sense
[00:11] kenperkins: oh really? 
[00:11] kenperkins: you can do that?
[00:12] itayneeman: assumign cluster.fork simply forks something off
[00:12] itayneeman: as in the OS fork
[00:12] itayneeman: then I would imagine it should work
[00:12] itayneeman: unless it is hard coded to the node executable path
[00:12] itayneeman: isaacs would know better
[00:12] davidbanham has joined the channel
[00:12] kenperkins: i don't know, hence my query :D
[00:12] isaacs: itayneeman: i believe it's process.execPath, yes
[00:12] idefine has joined the channel
[00:13] itayneeman: kenperkins: https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/cluster.js#L154
[00:13] kenperkins: but you'll need a different debug port for all processes wont you?
[00:13] itayneeman: yes, you'll have to have your script abstract over that
[00:13] kenperkins: ugh
[00:13] itayneeman: but it shouldnt be too hard - read from a file
[00:14] kenperkins: I know, but then you'll have to have 5 instances of node-inspector up
[00:14] kenperkins: it's just less than elegant
[00:14] itayneeman: what would your ideal situation be?
[00:15] kenperkins: one instance of node-inspector, and likely plumbing the debug information across processes
[00:15] kenperkins: (pulling this out of my ass btw)
[00:15] itayneeman: Seems difficult given that the webkit inspector doesn't expect more than a single process
[00:15] itayneeman: for example, when you set a breakpoint, which process should it go to?
[00:15] itayneeman: shit like that
[00:16] kenperkins: with source abstracted from processes in the debugger (i.e. 1 breakpoint for all processes, or scoped to single)
[00:16] itayneeman: I wish someone wrote another debugger for node that isnt tied to the browser
[00:16] kenperkins: think about debugging a complex problem, while also having multiple processes, and having multiple breakpoints. having to set all breakpoints in 5 different instances of node-inspector seems prohibitive
[00:17] mara has left the channel
[00:17] itayneeman: I dont disagree, I've done similar things before
[00:17] hihihi: does anyone use jade?
[00:17] itayneeman: (try debugging the hypervisor, root OS and guest OS at the same time: 2 machines, 3 debuggers :)
[00:17] killing-joke: dnode fails to install with npm-1.1.0-beta4   --   https://gist.github.com/1503918
[00:18] kenperkins: fair enough
[00:18] polo: I wonder if it's ok to pass the socket file path each time I call http.request() ? Isn't it going to reopen the socket at each request?
[00:19] itayneeman: To answer your original question: I don't think it's possible out of the box. You could do my (really, isaacs') suggested workaround to at least get them to be debuggable
[00:19] itayneeman: and then you can submit a pull request to make node-inspector even more awesome :D
[00:19] kenperkins: it's easier to just setup our dev environment to not use cluster :D
[00:19] itayneeman: true, but if you have separate processes, you have this problem, using cluster or not. :)
[00:20] kenperkins: indeed :)
[00:20] itayneeman: I would love it for someoen to integrate node with the VS debugger

[03:18] jamescarr: so a question. how do you share something like socket.io across multiple sub modules on the client side? :)
[03:19] jamescarr: so far, I use jquery pub/sub and publish an "application/init" event that has various things in it, like the socket.io object
[03:19] jamescarr: wondering if there is a better/cleaner way

[04:55] Sample: as a simple idea to get started with node I did a "net" package based IRC client. pretty simple. next I decided to toy with the "http" package and port that. the question arises though, it seems if I wanted to allow users to connect to IRC through http I would have to create a "net.connect" intance for every http request. is there a package to manage doing that kind of thing? or would simply

[05:55] icewhite has joined the channel

[05:56] jesusabdullah: in connect that's the case, anyway
[05:56] jesusabdullah: Other frameworks may or may not implement their own (hopefully compatible) req and res objects, for various reasons
[05:57] perezd: listening to res.on 'data' doesn't seem to actually do anything from Conncet...
[05:57] perezd: I get no data

[07:07] roflmaozedong: slaskis: "./configure" exited correctly, but, surprisingly, it did not find openssl.

[08:19] rendar has joined the channel
[08:19] spolu: itayneeman: don't know if I can answer but you can shoot anyway :)
[08:19] itayneeman: say I do:
[08:20] itayneeman: global.a = 2; require('./b'); 
[08:20] itayneeman: and in b.js I have
[08:20] itayneeman: console.log(global.a)
[08:20] itayneeman: that works fine, it prints 2
[08:20] itayneeman: but if I have
[08:20] itayneeman: global.a = 2; require('./b'); global.b = 2; require('./b');
[08:20] itayneeman: and in b I have
[08:20] itayneeman: console.log(global.a); console.log(global.b)
[08:21] spolu: yes
[08:21] itayneeman: then I will get 2, undefined, 2, undefined

[08:22] slaskis: itayneeman: it's what i'd expect?
[08:22] itayneeman: slaskis: yeah, willing to believe Im doing something wrong
[08:22] itayneeman: the question is how to get the globals to be reimported
[08:22] slaskis: b.js is cached the first time you require it
[08:22] slaskis: i don't think you can
[08:22] spolu: or maybe not
[08:22] spolu: in any case
[08:22] spolu: some people here would say that it's a bad idea to mess with your global
[08:22] murugaratham_ has joined the channel
[08:23] slaskis: what you can to though is let the b module return a function which can be called several times instead
[08:23] itayneeman: if I add this:
[08:23] itayneeman: delete require.cache[require.resolve('./b')];
[08:23] itayneeman: it'll work
[08:23] gigafied: you don't want to be assigning things to the global scope
[08:23] itayneeman: spolu: Im not directly messing with it, but other libs do, and I'm writing a code coverage utilty
[08:23] itayneeman: and running into an issue with mocha
[08:23] itayneeman: where TJ decides to make my life harder :D
[08:23] slaskis: haha
[08:24] spolu: itayneeman: you should not get the second "2, undefined"
[08:24] spolu: itayneeman: as b.js is executed only once
[08:24] itayneeman: spolu: yes, I was reading my output wrong
[08:24] itayneeman: I get 2, undefined
[08:24] itayneeman: you are correct
[08:24] whoops has joined the channel
[08:24] gigafied: 2, undefined, 2, 2?
[08:24] itayneeman: If I delete b.js from the cache, then it works
[08:25] itayneeman: global.a = 2;
[08:25] itayneeman: require('./b');
[08:25] itayneeman: delete require.cache[require.resolve('./b')];
[08:25] itayneeman: global.b = 3;
[08:25] itayneeman: require('./b');
[08:25] itayneeman: this will reproduce:
[08:25] itayneeman: 2, undefined, 2, 3
[08:25] itayneeman: if you remove the delete statement
[08:25] itayneeman: it will be:
[08:25] itayneeman: 2, undefined
[08:25] itayneeman: but now I see my problem, I believe

[08:27] slaskis: itayneeman: do you have a more complete example you could gist?
[08:27] itayneeman: slaskis: it's part of a more complex problem
[08:27] itayneeman: the module itself is open source:
[08:27] itayneeman: https://github.com/itay/node-cover
[08:27] itayneeman: the sequence of events is as follows:
[08:27] spolu: itayneeman: sounds like your problem is solved :)
[08:27] itayneeman: spolu: solved in the sense of knowing the problem, no idea what the solution is :)
[08:28] itayneeman: 1. I require my coverage library, which will replace require()
[08:28] itayneeman: 2. mocha code executes, and adds stuff to global
[08:28] itayneeman: 3. mocha requires a test file, assuming that the global stuff will be there
[08:28] itayneeman: but because my require is doing the global copying
[08:28] itayneeman: and it is already imported
[08:28] itayneeman: then it sees the odl globals, pre-additions
[08:28] itayneeman: and then everyone is sad
[08:29] slaskis: haha
[08:29] itayneeman: Hoepfully that made some sense
[08:29] slaskis: are you overriding require()?
[08:29] saesh has joined the channel
[08:29] gigafied: I don't think overriding require() is a good idea
[08:29] itayneeman: slaskis: yes - it will override require to generate code-coverage code
[08:29] slaskis: i didn't think that was possible even
[08:30] necromancer has joined the channel
[08:30] gigafied: do something like cover.require();
[08:30] itayneeman: gigafied: the idea is that you dont need to change your code to be able to run it through code coverage
[08:30] itayneeman: otherwise you have to maintain two versions of your code
[08:31] tiglionabbit has joined the channel
[08:31] itayneeman: slaskis: it does what the Module lib does (in core node): it copies the context and executes in a new VM context
[08:31] slaskis: but in every loaded module doesn't it set require as a function argument?
[08:31] itayneeman: it does
[08:31] itayneeman: and we do the same
[08:31] slaskis: meaning it would not use your global.require() ?
[08:31] itayneeman: I dont set it on global
[08:32] spolu: itayneeman: are you clearing somehow the require cache?
[08:32] loob2 has joined the channel
[08:32] itayneeman: I create a new VM context with require defined to be my require
[08:32] itayneeman: (much like what module.js is doing)
[08:32] slaskis: oh now i see
[08:32] itayneeman: spolu: no, though that isn't the issue. I need to be able to reimport globals somehow
[08:32] slaskis: it's a binary, so you'll load everything through your module
[08:32] itayneeman: slaskis: essentially
[08:33] itayneeman: what the require override does is: 1. read the code in from the FS, 2. generate instrumented code, 3. generate a context, 4. run the instrumented code
[08:34] slaskis: but the problem is when the instrumented code uses require() ?
[08:34] itayneeman: slaskis: no, it is when it uses global
[08:34] itayneeman: Before I run any code, I do require('cover')
[08:34] itayneeman: which loads my coverage module, which does some setup
[08:34] slaskis: oh duh (not enough coffee yet)

[11:03] Neil__: baudehlo: Would you know how to catch this: Error R10 (Boot timeout) -> Web process failed to bind to $PORT within 60 seconds of launch
[11:03] baudehlo: maybe it's not an exception. Maybe it's just console.log()'d
[11:05] Neil__: baudehlo: I don't understand
[11:05] baudehlo: process.on('uncaughtException') only catches exceptions thrown by "throw".
[11:05] Neil__: baudehlo: ok
[11:05] davman has joined the channel
[11:06] baudehlo: so if the library you're using isn't doing that, and is instead doing: console.log("Error R10…"), then you won't be catching it.

[14:18] bnoordhuis: Tug: you don't have to
[14:18] bnoordhuis: you can pass a createConnection property in the options object that's a function that knows how to connect to a unix socket
[14:19] Tug: yeah I saw that
[14:19] bnoordhuis: oh, come to think of it - i think the agent code does support it out of the box
[14:19] Tug: it's kind of plumbing
[14:19] bnoordhuis: it calls net.createConnection() by default and that knows how to deal with unix sockets
[14:20] Tug: yeah but I just looked at the code and I think it reopens the socket each time

[14:24] BrianE has joined the channel
[14:25] Tug: sure but I wantto modify the node-http-proxy lib and it's going to proxy to local backend servers, I suppose the proxy is going to handle lots of connection, it makes sense to me if we keep the connection to each backend open

[14:27] Tug: actually I modified it already https://github.com/Tug/node-http-proxy/commit/18872169d94f1c7842ab02b4090a54f21f8eb7c1
[14:27] Tug: but I feel like it's wrong...
[14:29] bnoordhuis: Tug: use the createConnection property and cache the sockets
[14:29] bnoordhuis: you'll probably need to overload socket.destroySoon() too, to prevent them from being closed after the request is done
[14:30] bnoordhuis: still, i don't think you'll see a big jump in performance

[16:29] jocafa has joined the channel
[16:29] justicefries: will do, I may start doing some stuff with subqueries and getting more advanced postgres stuff in there.
[16:30] TimTim: astropirate: cookies keep getting overwritten so sessions can't persist

[16:31] brianc1: justicefries: not really
[16:31] justicefries: i'm debating whether it'd be worth having something similar to a general schema.rb (schema.json?) with the notion of migrations...

[16:42] TimTim: 7 hours of this crap
[16:42] TimTim: i've reduced everything to a simple use-case and still nothing
[16:42] Aikar: ismell: up to date no, npm install n, then 'n latest' and youll be up to date
[16:43] Aikar: just note n is not friendly in stable vs unstable and will jump you into unstable
[16:43] Aikar: so 'n 0.6.12' for example when .7 starts will install 0.6.12
[16:44] ismell: cool
[16:44] ismell: I remember there was a website that generated a shell script for node

[16:46] tjholowaychuk: TimTim we're using it with 0.4.x

[16:56] TimTim: tjholowaychuk i'm also using hiredis... would that effect the connect-redis module?
[16:56] TimTim: *affect

[16:57] TimTim: i also noticed that when configuring 0.6.6, it said openssl was not found
[16:57] TimTim: but openssl is definitely installed :|
[16:57] swaj: TimTim: that's just because you probably don't have pkginfo installed
[16:58] swaj: the configure script uses pkginfo to see if openssl is installed, if that fails, then it looks for the headers manually
[16:58] TimTim: would that just be apt-get install pkginfo?

[17:01] swaj: TimTim: also, connect-redis works fine on 0.6.x, I'm using it with no problems.
[17:01] TimTim: hmm upgrade to 0.6.6 still didn't fix connect-redis

[17:01] N0va` has joined the channel
[17:02] TimTim: works fine with express's native sessions
[17:02] swaj: they get reset with a rolling expiration by default
[17:02] swaj: if that's what you mean
[17:02] tjholowaychuk: sounds like a race condition
[17:02] swaj: they'll get reset every request
[17:02] tjholowaychuk: since the memory store is pretty much instant
[17:02] EhevuTov has joined the channel
[17:02] Aikar: is that page that shows top nmodule authors still up, whats substack and tjs count up to?
[17:03] swaj: connect-redis by default uses a rolling expiration on the session cookie, so every time a new page is requested, the expiration date will be updated, causing the cookie to be re-sent.
[17:03] swaj: at least that's been my expierience
[17:03] TimTim: well yesterday i did a ton of console logging and notice that the options.maxAge (or maybe it was cookie.maxAge) was blank
[17:04] joshontheweb has joined the channel
[17:04] tjholowaychuk: swaj yup. i plan on doing that periodically but for now yeah it's pretty greedy
[17:04] TimTim: how do i ensure the cookie doesn't get resent, swaj?
[17:04] EhevuTov_ has joined the channel
[17:04] tjholowaychuk: TimTim you cant right now until we hash
[17:04] swaj: you want them to have an absolute expiration?
[17:04] swaj: I don't think that's possible in the current connect-redis session store
[17:04] lduros has joined the channel
[17:05] tjholowaychuk: and yeah you'll have sessions that magically drop out

[17:05] pauls1 has joined the channel
[17:06] tjholowaychuk: "browser session sessions" is always a weird one to describe
[17:06] tjholowaychuk: haha
[17:06] swaj: yeah :P
[17:06] TimTim: ah well rolling session cookies is what i want then... i guess the question i meant to ask is how do i ensure node sends the current cookie
[17:07] swaj: eh?
[17:07] swaj: connect-session will handle that
[17:07] TimTim: doesn't seem to be :|
[17:07] swaj: the default maxAge is like 8 hours I think
[17:07] TimTim: maybe i could manually parse the current connect.sid cookie and set it in the header for every request myself?
[17:07] tjholowaychuk: i wonder if you have an asset that is requested _first_
[17:07] tjholowaychuk: but it takes so long
[17:07] tjholowaychuk: that it's saved _last_

[17:09] tmedema: and I am generally interested
[17:09] jacobolus has joined the channel
[17:09] swaj: if you want to use rolling-expiration cookies, try something like:  app.use(express.session({ secret: 'foo', store: new RedisStore(), cookie: { expires: true, maxAge: some-big-number } }));
[17:09] swaj: (if my memory serves me)
[17:10] bnoordhuis: tmedema: the answer is "you can't" and "you should probably use the cluster api"
[17:10] fzzzy has joined the channel
[17:10] tmedema: bnoordhuis: why is it not possible? don't sockets have file descriptors?
[17:10] swaj: or you probably don't even need to set the default "expires" -- just set the maxAge to something 
[17:10] stereosteve has joined the channel
[17:10] bnoordhuis: tmedema: not on windows
[17:10] tjholowaychuk: TimTim i would definitely try and isolate a single request first
[17:11] tmedema: bnoordhuis: so it would be possible on linux?
[17:11] tjholowaychuk: really sounds like a race
[17:11] tjholowaychuk: with that weird pattern you showed me too
[17:11] bnoordhuis: tmedema: yes
[17:11] jocafa: "With race conditions, nobody is a winner."
[17:11] tmedema: bnoordhuis: is that fd accessible from the socket variable then?
[17:12] bnoordhuis: tmedema: not from javascript
[17:12] tmedema: bnoordhuis: alright, I guess it really shouldn't even be tried then
[17:12] erikzaadi: jocafa +1 :)
[17:12] tmedema: thanks

[17:13] swaj: TimTim: also, #express is good for express-related issues, too :P
[17:13] TimTim: removing hiredis didn't help :|
[17:13] TimTim: ACTION joins #express.
[17:13] tjholowaychuk: the thing i dont get is, if it's a race and you get this consistently, why do we never have issues
[17:14] swaj: I'm not even sure what the issue is :P
[17:14] swaj: he seemed to not want cookies being reset on every request, which isn't doable atm, I think.
[17:14] tjholowaychuk: a parallel request could be coming in, causing session() to generate a new id
[17:14] jetienne has joined the channel
[17:15] tjholowaychuk: before the main page request finishes
[17:15] tjholowaychuk: generating more than one id

[19:13] nrstott: tab1293, have your node.js program make a server with a route that your python app can post to
[19:14] tab1293: post to meaning over http?
[19:14] nrstott: yes
[19:14] swaj: tab1293: is your torrent program something you can control?
[19:14] nrstott: or use tcp if you want, doesn't matter
[19:14] tab1293: swaj: yes
[19:14] swaj: i.e., is it your code, or is it just a vended application you don't feel comfortable customizing
[19:15] tab1293: swaj: no its my code
[19:15] saesh has joined the channel
[19:15] itayneeman: tjholowaychuk: even without cover, I cant get any of the express tests to pass
[19:15] itayneeman: any idea why?
[19:15] sakkaku_ has joined the channel
[19:15] tab1293: nrstott: is tcp to low level? should i be sending this data over a protocol instead of just raw data?
[19:15] tjholowaychuk: itayneeman oh really?
[19:15] swaj: so yeah, have your node app listen on some random port with express or connect, and just post progress to the node app, then in the node app you can notify subscribers.
[19:15] tjholowaychuk: itayneeman you should just have to install the dev deps
[19:15] tjholowaychuk: and make test
[19:15] nrstott: tab1293, id just use http if you're asking my opinion
[19:16] itayneeman: ah, OK, let me try that

[19:16] AndreasMadsen has joined the channel
[19:16] tab1293: ok well i want the torrent client to constantly be sending data to node.js in realtime so what should the connection be?
[19:16] swaj: tab1293: if you really want to, you could use a named pipe or unix socket and make your own protocol, but I agree that something simple like HTTP would work fine... or even ZeroMQ
[19:17] shripadk: tab1293: use 0mq or something like that...
[19:17] nrstott: tab1293, you could pipe stdout of your python program into stdin of your node program :)
[19:17] tab1293: i feel like http is a pain to implement streaming
[19:17] Aikar: raw TCP with a framing mechanism is best, is node.js on both endpoints?
[19:17] nrstott: tab1293, and then just use stdin to read in node
[19:17] Aikar: tab1293: ^\
[19:17] swaj: tab1293: ZeroMQ is really good for that kind of fire-and-forget IPC
[19:17] jetienne has joined the channel
[19:17] Venom_X: yeah, I'd go with ZMQ
[19:17] swaj: http://www.zeromq.org/
[19:17] tjholowaychuk: zmq++
[19:17] tab1293: Aikar: what do you mean by on both endpoints
[19:17] shripadk: :)
[19:17] nrstott: i feel ZMQ is a bit overarchitecting this
[19:17] shripadk: why?
[19:17] Aikar: tab1293: the sender, you mentioned a torrent client, what language is doing the sending?
[19:17] nrstott: i feel that doing anything other than use raw node with an http route is overdoing it for what he asked
[19:17] fzzzy has joined the channel
[19:18] nrstott: this can be very simple
[19:18] tab1293: Aikar: python
[19:18] swaj: he has a python process and a node process that need to communicate with each other.  Using 0MQ to push JSON data or something similar back and forth actually makes a lot of sense in this case, imo.
[19:18] Aikar: nrstott: http isnt meant to be long lived, so if hes constantly sending data http is horrible
[19:19] Aikar: 0mq is a good option yeah but its a heavier implementation (which doesnt mean itll take a long time to setup, just more cogwheels thatl lbe running)
[19:19] swaj: 0MQ has great bindings for both node.js and python
[19:19] tab1293: yeah well alright ill looking into 0MQ 
[19:19] shripadk: well the adv with 0mq is that your app won't crash if the python server crashes
[19:19] Aikar: a simple TCP pipe that sends JSON messages with new line delimeters is the simplest way to send data
[19:19] swaj: yeah
[19:19] nrstott: Aikar, how often do you really care about sending progress updates?  once a minute?  once every 5 mins? with huge torrents do you really need second by second updates?
[19:19] tjholowaychuk: zmq is pretty tiny
[19:19] shripadk: the disadvantage is serialization/deseerialization of JSON
[19:19] Aikar: nrstott: i dunno what hes doing, but he said real time
[19:19] tab1293: nrstott: it would be nice
[19:20] Aikar: tjholowaychuk: is there a native 0mq imp or does it require compiling?
[19:20] nrstott: ok then go with something more complex, was just trying to keep it simple for you :)
[19:20] tab1293: maybe every 5 seconds to get an update
[19:20] tjholowaychuk: compiling
[19:20] tjholowaychuk: but who cares
[19:20] tjholowaychuk: easy to install
[19:20] swaj: ZMQ is zomg fast, and good, and small, and awesome.  Use it, problem solved :P

[19:20] Cromulent has joined the channel

[19:20] swaj: go for it
[19:20] tab1293: with json
[19:21] Aikar: well if i had an app that has no binary dependencies currently, id be hesistant to introduce one and complicating deployment when other simple options exists

[19:21] shripadk: if you want the latest
[19:21] itayneeman: tjholowaychuk: some of the express tests run into the bunker bug I mentioned (which I believe is probably due to uglify
[19:21] shripadk: sudo npm install zmq-3.0
[19:21] tjholowaychuk: itayneeman oh lame
[19:21] tab1293: Aikar: well the libtorrent library is already a dependency so im not really worried about that

[19:22] Aikar: tab1293: ah alright then, 0mq is prolly a good choice for you then

[19:52] Sample: as a simple idea to get started with node I did a "net" package based IRC client. pretty simple. next I decided to toy with the "http" package and port the "net"-based irc client to that. the question arises though: It seems if I wanted to allow users to connect to IRC through http I would have to create a "net.createConnection" intance for every http request. is there a package to manage 
[19:52] Sample: doing that kind of user-to-http association thing (is this in the realm of sessions?) or would simply keeping an array of "net" connections with associated IP addresses be sufficient?

[20:06] TheJH: CoverSlide, e.g. in json, you use properties, but in XML, you use named child nodes, but there could be multiple with the same name

[22:02] chrisdickinson: basically, there's a web worker that runs a mirror of the game state from the server, and the main loop acts as the input / renderer thread.
[22:02] ljackson has joined the channel
[22:02] Brandon_R: making a game is so freaking awesome
[22:02] chrisdickinson: when the server detects a "fire" request, it creates an object, and pushes that to the clients.
[22:02] isaacs has joined the channel
[22:02] chrisdickinson: only properties that have changed during a frame are transmitted between the server -> client thread -> client input -> server
[22:03] ibolmo: itayneeman: 1.1.0-beta-4
[22:03] itayneeman: ibolmo: yeah, not sure. I have no trouble getting less

[22:03] ibolmo: could be a config in my security
[22:03] mAritz has joined the channel
[22:03] chrisdickinson: i need to work on making the game state deterministic, and then hopefully moving on to sending CRC checksums of client world state along with the input events.
[22:04] chrisdickinson: that way if the server detects that the worldstate matches on the client, it can omit sending an update for that frame.

[22:23] sstreza has joined the channel
[22:23] itayneeman: isaacs: is there an easy way with the node executable to extract all the parameters/arguments that are for the actual program, and not the node executable?
[22:23] itayneeman: per our discussion yesterday of hooking into the node startup
[22:24] isaacs: itayneeman: there are several modules that do this
[22:25] chilts: process.argv is something to look at to see it, but yeah, things like optimist, nopt and commander can help
[22:25] itayneeman: isaacs: such as? Im not talking about general cmdline processing modules, but rather, I need to know whether --ll_prof is for node, or the actuals cript
[22:25] itayneeman: sorry if I wasn't clear
[22:25] chilts: there was a recent thread about what people's preferred param module is
[22:25] isaacs: itayneeman: optimist, nopt, nomnom, etc.
[22:25] isaacs: itayneeman: oh, i see.
[22:25] tjholowaychuk: i think he means a whitelist
[22:25] tjholowaychuk: of node things
[22:25] isaacs: itayneeman: that's tricky
[22:25] chilts: right
[22:26] itayneeman: tjholowaychuk: basically, yes
[22:26] tjholowaychuk: getting mocha --debug
[22:26] chilts: I wonder if there is anything under process.*
[22:26] tjholowaychuk: to work was such a hack
[22:26] tjholowaychuk: haha
[22:26] itayneeman: when my node executable gets exec'ed, I need to be able to know what things I need to pass to node, and which things I need to pass to the script
[22:27] itayneeman: tjholowaychuk: yeah, but you had the benefit of only needing to look for --debug :)
[22:27] tjholowaychuk: yup
[22:27] itayneeman: I need it all
[22:27] tjholowaychuk: grep --v8-options
[22:27] itayneeman: or, alternatively: a way to prepend some code to the executign script
[22:27] tjholowaychuk: or sth
[22:28] chrisdickinson: itayneeman: you could run it as "node -e 'require('cover/wrapper')(original_module)' in that case?
[22:28] chilts: kenperkins: that's my plan, though I'm not yet up and running
[22:29] gruseom has joined the channel
[22:29] itayneeman: chrisdickinson: how do I know what the original module is?
[22:29] chilts: kenperkins: for rolling deployments, I would tell the LB to stop talking to a node while you restart it
[22:29] chilts: kenperkins: and then restart it, then put it back in
[22:29] chilts: or the LB could do this automatically once it sees your server isn't responding
[22:29] sshaginyan has joined the channel
[22:29] kenperkins: that's what I *want* to do, fighting with Rackspace's ghetto LB service
[22:29] chilts: oh right
[22:29] chilts: hmmm, I haven't used theirs ... sorry
[22:30] chilts: but yeah, sounds like you know what you _want_ to do :)
[22:30] chrisdickinson: itayneeman: from the original command "cover --debug something.js"?
[22:30] itayneeman: chrisdickinson: imagine that somebody does: "spawn('node', ['myscript.js'])"
[22:30] itayneeman: from somewhere within their code
[22:30] itayneeman: I want to be able to catch that and redirect it, in a sense
[22:31] chrisdickinson: itayneeman: so you want to run coverage, even for spawn'd subprocesses?
[22:31] itayneeman: isaacs' suggestion was to add my own 'node' to the PATH, so that it will get called
[22:31] itayneeman: chrisdickinson: yes
[22:31] itayneeman: it's not uncommon for testing libraries to do this
[22:31] isaacs: itayneeman: fair warning: this is a terrible hack.
[22:31] itayneeman: isaacs: this entirely library is one big hack
[22:31] itayneeman: :D
[22:31] kenperkins: chilts: just confirming my course plan and making sure I'm not missing some option
[22:31] tjholowaychuk: itayneeman i still think it's more valuable as a lib
[22:31] qbert_: So I have an all JS app that has several screens that load in the background, and they all issue an ajax request for the same data - anyone know of some libraries I can use so that instead of sending 3 of the same request and getting the same data, it issues one request and the others just used the cached data
[22:31] kenperkins: basically: rackspace has the dumbest most moronic (slight extreme) LB service implementation ever
[22:31] tjholowaychuk: just with a simple clean api
[22:31] chrisdickinson: itayneeman: hack `child_process`.
[22:32] chrisdickinson: monkeypatch `spawn` with your own command that intercepts `node`?
[22:32] itayneeman: chrisdickinson: yes, I've considered intercepting "require('child_process')"
[22:32] itayneeman: tjholowaychuk: it already is a library and can be used as such
[22:32] qbert_: tjholowaychuk, just an aside, I had to modify connect-mongo do take a ReplicaSet config option for the MongoStore for sessions
[22:33] tjholowaychuk: qbert_ i didnt write that one
[22:33] qbert_: oh then nevermind ;)
[22:33] tjholowaychuk: :D
[22:33] itayneeman: tjholowaychuk: but I don't think you want people to need to change their testing code to just have code coverage. It should "just work"
[22:33] itayneeman: that's what i'm trying to solve
[22:33] tjholowaychuk: itayneeman no no
[22:33] tjholowaychuk: but then i can add
[22:33] tjholowaychuk: --cov
[22:33] tjholowaychuk: easily
[22:33] itayneeman: right
[22:34] itayneeman: my plan for you is to do have something like: "var cover = require('cover').cli; cover.run("root test file");
[22:34] itayneeman: and boom, it goes
[22:34] gruseom: hi, is there a way for a SIGINT handler to be executed before returning control to the running program?
[22:34] trentm has joined the channel
[22:34] gruseom: i'm writing a debugging client and want to trap SIGINT, have the handler tell the debugger to break, then resume execution. unfortunately my handler doesn't seem to run until the currently executing code returns, which defeats the purpose.
[22:34] tjholowaychuk: but then you have that same process issue
[22:35] chrisdickinson: ACTION is glad he left the CLI bits out of runforcover :)
[22:35] itayneeman: not sure what you mean. Say you add --cov - what would you want to be able to do?
[22:35] itayneeman: chrisdickinson: someone's gotta do it :)
[22:35] tjholowaychuk: just cover.monkeyPatchRequireOrWhatever(); and later cover.outputHTML('to/here')
[22:35] tjholowaychuk: no child process stuff
[22:36] itayneeman: OK - but what if your test lib forks something?
[22:36] tjholowaychuk: that's its deal
[22:36] chrisdickinson: ACTION is +1 on that.
[22:37] sylvinus_ has joined the channel
[22:37] itayneeman: There are a couple of issues here: 1. some testing libraries fork by default for each file (I've been told tap does something like thiat).
[22:38] itayneeman: 2. There's still an issue of needing to combine multiple coverage reports from multiple processes into one
[22:38] tjholowaychuk: i'd still delegate that concern to the js api
[22:38] igl has joined the channel
[22:38] nibblebot has joined the channel
[22:39] tjholowaychuk: i dunno
[22:39] itayneeman: yeah, I originally was of your opinion
[22:39] tjholowaychuk: nested execs just dont seem like the way to go
[22:39] itayneeman: the nested execs would only happen if the code beign covered was execing
[22:39] tjholowaychuk: if anything the jscov lib-cov was cleaner
[22:39] booyaa: well about to have my first real test of using the ipad for coding

[22:40] jetienne has joined the channel
[22:40] itayneeman: There are two separate issues here, I think: 1. The general coverage runner (the cover executable). 2. How to expose the API to libraries to integrate with the coverage library
[22:42] chrisdickinson: ACTION works on backporting changes into runforcover, which sort of answers #2.
[22:42] tjholowaychuk: jscov worked just fine other than it being c
[22:42] itayneeman: for (2), you want something like: var cover = require('cover'); cover.start(); cover.on('end', function() { writeHTML(somePath); })
[22:43] sstreza has left the channel
[22:43] kerang has joined the channel
[22:43] itayneeman: chrisdickinson: the reporting logic is all in the cover executable, not in the main instrumentation code.
[22:44] chrisdickinson: itayneeman: ah.
[22:44] itayneeman: chrisdickinson: most of the code has to do with building up tables/HTML/whatever, writing things to default locations, reading them from default locations, etc

[22:46] jaequery: maxogden, yeah but in reality, thats not as easy as it sounds
[22:47] itayneeman: tjholowaychuk: I think we can provide you with a very easy API, and all the concerns of how it works are hidden from you (and have no effect on you)
[22:47] maxogden: jaequery: it is once youve written javascript for a while
[22:47] tjholowaychuk: jaequery it's easy it's just something you have to learn
[22:47] Sorella: jaequery, it's not a difficult as it sounds, once you've learnt the language :3

[22:57] ovaillancourt: (proven by Matthew Cook)
[22:58] Sorella: tjholowaychuk, well, CSS4 will apparently let you chose an arbitrary element within the selector to which the rules should be applied to.
[22:58] tjholowaychuk: sweet
[22:58] tjholowaychuk: that will be great

[23:09] isaacs: indeed!
[23:09] gigafied: The debate of namespacing with a TLD is out of the scope of the question :) :p
[23:10] isaacs: gigafied: you know all the valid tld's ahead of time, right?
[23:10] gigafied: isaacs: yeah
[23:10] maxogden: stick your company name in there too, it will build your brand with developers consuming your library
[23:10] isaacs: gigafied: k, then that should work
[23:10] gigafied: isaacs: this is just for a snippet in sublime text, nothing too crazy, just a little quality of life thing
[23:10] Brandon_R: i think only java does namespacing with a tld
[23:11] maxogden: com/lookwedoopensourcecomeworkforus/src/site
[23:11] jerrysv: i've seen it in js too
[23:11] isaacs: Brandon_R: flash apps do that, too
[23:11] Brandon_R: oh yeah
[23:11] isaacs: not just flash, what's that xml backend flash thing?
[23:11] isaacs: flex
[23:11] isaacs: that thing

[23:11] Brandon_R: all the lasagna code languages 
[23:11] gigafied: haha, as3 in general
[23:11] Sorella: That's where the minimalism of Unix kicks asses. just have a /src /docs /test /lib /bin
[23:11] Brandon_R: too many layers = lasagnas 
[23:11] Brandon_R: get it lol
[23:11] Brandon_R: like speghetti code
[23:12] gigafied: the good thing about TLD namespacing is that it pretty much nullifies the possibility of namespace conflicts
[23:12] isaacs: Brandon_R: i first read that as "too many lawyers = lasagnas"
[23:12] isaacs: heh
[23:12] Sorella: gigafied, so do parametric modules and non-global imports.
[23:12] isaacs: IANAL
[23:12] gigafied: but it is verbose
[23:12] mnutt has joined the channel
[23:12] Sorella: but Java is just broken.
[23:12] isaacs: (i am not a lasagne)
[23:13] maxogden: java has too many subfolders, better rewrite every java library in node
[23:13] Brandon_R: hey isaccs, when are you guys going to have more talks?

[23:13] isaacs: Brandon_R: winter is no good for confs.
[23:13] isaacs: holidays and cold weather.  feh.
[23:13] isaacs: better to stay inside and eat and hack quietly :)
[23:14] Brandon_R: does it snow in san Francisco? 
[23:14] isaacs: oh, lord no
[23:14] isaacs: it's like 60˚ outside right now
[23:14] Brandon_R: lucky
[23:14] isaacs: :)
[23:14] Brandon_R: it should snow here any day now
[23:14] jerrysv: sunny here, but cold
[23:14] maxogden: jerrysv: had a bike ride in the portland fog this morning. thoroughly invigorating

[23:30] tjholowaychuk: ahahaha
[23:30] tjholowaychuk: one word
[23:30] tjholowaychuk: fail
[23:30] Sorella: Brandon_R, given CoffeeScript doesn't introduce any new paradigm or interesting feature, if you're comfortable writing JS I'd say no.
[23:31] cmr: ACTION thinks CoffeeScript is ugly
[23:31] Sorella: Though CoffeeScript is "better" suited for writing DSLs, if you can keep within the boundaries of the quirky parser.
[23:31] gruseom has left the channel
[23:31] tjholowaychuk: why dsl when you can just.. write a non-shitty api
[23:32] tjholowaychuk: or write a real dsl
[23:32] alejandromg: ACTION don't like cs
[23:32] Sorella: tjholowaychuk, because you can solve better some problems by writing a DSL for it.
[23:32] Vespakoen has joined the channel
[23:32] Sorella: though, yes, CoffeeScript code just looks like a hacky DSL, which is why I put "better" in quotes :3
[23:32] tjholowaychuk: dsl is just another name for simple api if it's in the same language
[23:33] chrisdickinson: dsl's aren't bad, but they're rarely the right answer.
[23:33] tjholowaychuk: app.get('/', fn) zomg it's a dsl
[23:33] Brandon_R: what is a sdl
[23:33] cjlicata has joined the channel
[23:33] chrisdickinson: if, when confronted with a problem, your first reaction is to write a parser -- you're probably overthinking the problem. probably.
[23:34] tjholowaychuk: probably yup
[23:34] chrisdickinson: it's the programming equivalent of sweet guitar noodle-ry.
[23:34] cmr: Brandon_R: Doman-Specific Language

[23:35] Brandon_R: c
[23:35] Sorella has joined the channel
[23:36] cmr: I suppose BNF would be considered a DSL.
[23:36] AvianFlu: assembly isn't a dsl - you can write anything in assembly, albeit slowly and painfully
[23:36] tjholowaychuk: yeah definitely
[23:36] cmr: ACTION doesn't know the rigorous definition of DSL
[23:36] Sorella: bleh.
[23:36] AvianFlu: a dsl can only accomplish tasks in a certain domain, that's why it's a dsl
[23:36] joshsmith: this is weird. I have a file that's all jQuery that's instantiating a backbone model, i.e. var user = new User("Leo McGarry");
[23:36] perezd: I can equally do that with binary code
[23:36] perezd: albeit ever more slowly
[23:36] AvianFlu: and not just new programming language #986
[23:36] Sorella: anyways, the best thing would be having a language with first-class syntax that compiles down to JS. Or something like Racket.
[23:36] joshsmith: when I run ready.js to aggregate/minify my js files
[23:36] joshsmith: it removes the 'var user = '
[23:37] insin: DSL: "zomg, whitespace calls functions in this language - if I line the arguments up in this order... kinda englishey!"
[23:37] perezd: man people are so ridiculous with their coffee script hate
[23:37] Sorella: insin, no, that's "DSL". Plus english is a terrible programming language.
[23:37] ZeepZop has joined the channel
[23:37] tjholowaychuk: it's basically a template engine
[23:38] Sorella: Haskell programmers don't try to make their program look like English, afaik.

[23:38] tjholowaychuk: anyone with a half-assed parser generator could write the same thing in a week or two
[23:38] Brandon_R: perl is the only language whose rsa encryption of the src code looks like the original language
[23:38] perezd: and that some how makes it bad?
[23:38] Sorella: tjholowaychuk, you could write it in one day with OMeta or something.
[23:38] tjholowaychuk: makes it pointless and lame
[23:38] AvianFlu: hey, don't make fun of perl
[23:39] Sorella: perezd, what makes it bad is that it doesn't introduce anything new.
[23:39] Brandon_R: exactly
[23:39] perezd: Sorella: what?
[23:39] perezd: yes it does?
[23:39] Sorella: it doesn't put in anything that's lacking in JS, so it's pretty pointless.
[23:39] tmundal has joined the channel
[23:39] Sorella: perezd, just different syntax to achieve the same goals. But nothing there to handle asynchronous control flow, modularisation and such important stuff.
[23:39] perezd: comprehensions, implicit best practices, whitespace based inference 
[23:39] Brandon_R: node.dart, am i right?
[23:40] perezd: sure it does
[23:40] perezd: you have callbacks
[23:40] trco has joined the channel
[23:40] perezd: just like in javascript
[23:40] perezd: yay
[23:40] tjholowaychuk: it's retarded
[23:40] Sorella: "best practices". I'm pretty sure many JS devs would argue Cockford is right with most of his stuff.
[23:40] Sorella: for example, double equals are mostly always better than triple equals.
[23:40] cjm has joined the channel
[23:40] Sorella: unless you care about micro-optimisations.
[23:40] trco: Afternoon all. Does anyone have any suggestions for a good orm for postgresql in node?
[23:41] perezd: I'm done bike shedding with you guys, that was fun
[23:41] tmundal: Hello guys... Im starting with nodejs, and im also starting to learn how to use emacs xD does anyone know how i can run nodejs in emacs with a live repl to evaluate code blocks directly into the "loop", like clojure does, or if its possible?
[23:41] Brandon_R: perezd, do you have a github?>
[23:41] gigafied: idk, I don't agree with not using ++ and instead using +=1
[23:41] perezd: yes
[23:41] Sorella: gigafied, no.
[23:41] perezd: Brandon_R: why?
[23:41] Brandon_R: wanna check out your stuff
[23:41] perezd: Brandon_R: the stuff I am working on is not public currently
[23:41] Brandon_R: oh
[23:42] perezd: I use coffee script on my engineering team within node, we're quite happy with it
[23:42] Brandon_R: will it be open source?
[23:42] perezd: been using it for about 11 months
[23:42] perezd: parts of it will be
[23:42] bnoordhuis: are we bashing languages?
[23:42] Brandon_R: no, just coffeescript
[23:42] perezd: yeah, fuck fortran 
[23:42] gigafied: sorella: no?
[23:42] Sorella: Brandon_R, lol. Nicely played :3
[23:42] bnoordhuis: erlang! orelse, andalso! who came up with that stuff?
[23:42] trco: Or any documentation on using postgresql with node at all :) would be highly appreciated
[23:42] Brandon_R: leave erlang alone
[23:42] perezd: bnoordhuis: yeah! seriously, who needs concurrency
[23:43] Sorella: gigafied, no. Prefix increment/decrements are useful.
[23:43] perezd: lets just cut right to the point and get client-side PHP 
[23:43] Sorella: Just as ASI is useful.
[23:43] joshsmith: ugh Closure Compiler is just stripping "dead code"
[23:43] Brandon_R: can we just all say each language has it's ups and downs and none will fit everyone?
[23:43] perezd: thats usually my stance, rather than foolishly berating alternatives
[23:43] Sorella: joshsmith, it has some bugs, and it'll remove what it thinks has no side-effects from its analysis.
[23:43] cmr: Brandon_R: But what about the holy war? We need to use all these weapons somewhere...
[23:43] perezd: but seriously, I can't stand the blanket hatred 
[23:43] bnoordhuis: but it's so much fun!
[23:44] insin: advanced mode is hopp-jumpy
[23:44] Sorella: joshsmith, it used to remove: void function(){ window.x = 1 }(); claiming that code has no side effects :3
[23:44] Brandon_R: forget languages. lets talk about operating systems
[23:44] insin: er, hoop
[23:44] gigafied: joshsmith: uglify is a lot faster than closure btw
[23:44] cmr: Forget operating systems, let's talk about text editors, stir up some real flame... or let's just stop!
[23:44] joshsmith: gigafied: yeah, but ready.js uses Closure
[23:44] Brandon_R: forget text editors, let's talk about apple.
[23:44] joshsmith: is there a better solution for packaging/minifying my code in one step?
[23:44] insin: why not just skip to the end game and talk about your mothers?
[23:45] Brandon_R: let the flame war commence
[23:45] Sorella: perezd, I'm not "blankly hating" CoffeeScript. I did happen to use it for quite awhile.
[23:45] lzskiss: talking about the girls
[23:45] joshsmith: packaging = aggregating
[23:45] lzskiss: :D

[23:55] lzskiss: Sorella, the e17 is a neverending love
[23:55] joshsmith: hmm thanks jerrysv. gonna try it
[23:55] joshsmith: the fact that it uses uglify over closure compiler is a win
[23:55] andrew12: i'm not even typing right now
[23:55] Brandon_R: erlang is cool
[23:55] Brandon_R: ACTION hides
[23:56] jerrysv: joshsmith: yeah, works fairly well. we're using it for our newer properties
[23:56] jerrysv: as part of our build process, and during dev
[23:56] joshsmith: I'd like something that has a larger follower base, though
[23:56] Brandon_R: xenforo?
[23:57] jerrysv: yeah, i know what you mean. the dev hasn't done much to promote it
[23:57] joshsmith: man, if ready.js just swapped closure compiler for uglify, I would be set
[23:57] jerrysv: but we are using it in production, so there's at least one testimonial
[23:57] Brandon_R: jerrysv, what testimonial?
[23:57] jerrysv: digiwano_: ping
