[01:05] Raynos: luckysmack: You dont need a mvc framework, you just write modular code. Just do the architecture yourself

[03:59] JesusRosso: If I understand, I need the backstrace in the last call to `uv_idle_stop` before the break no ?
[04:00] lorfds: this whole callback thing is still confusing me a bit with node
[04:00] lorfds: https://github.com/wdavidw/node-csv-parser
[04:00] lorfds: i am trying to use this csvparser along with a web scraper i built
[04:01] lorfds: it takes some time to go grab the data i want with the scraper
[04:01] lorfds: i am trying to loop through the csv file....call the scraper function...and then write to the csv file when the scraper returns
[04:01] lorfds: is the issue just that there is no callback for the transform function of the csv parser...and that i would need to create one?
[04:02] lorfds: im confused about the simplest way to achieve what i want
[04:02] lyte has joined the channel

[04:02] Aria: Is the CSV parsing something that would need a callback?
[04:02] Aria: It's not an IO-bound function is it?
[04:02] lorfds: uhhh...i have no idea?
[04:02] lorfds: i dont know what an io bound function is....
[04:03] Aria: Something that accesses the disk or network.
[04:03] lorfds: yeah it hits the disk for sure
[04:03] Aria: Rather than being purely computational.
[04:03] Aria: Yeah? Just parsing?
[04:03] Aria: It's combination read-and-parse?
[04:03] lorfds: it s reading from csv
[04:03] micheil: JesusRosso: hmm.. perhaps.
[04:05] lorfds: it reads file, parses the data (i can access data as an array)
[04:05] lorfds: this is git project
[04:05] lorfds: https://github.com/wdavidw/node-csv-parser
[04:05] Aria: Hm. The whole file? How un-nodely!
[04:05] lorfds: well...it has some callbacks
[04:05] lorfds: .transform
[04:05] lorfds: .on
[04:05] lorfds: etc
[04:05] halfhalo: iirc it does it line by line with callbacks
[04:05] lorfds: yeah
[04:05] Aria: Oh, yeah. That makes sense then
[04:05] lorfds: so my issue is...how do i make it wait for my scraper to return to write back to the file
[04:05] halfhalo: although when i ran it i ran it against an 800k line csv, so wasn't really wanting to find that stuff out from console output
[04:05] Aria: What's the scraper part do?
[04:05] lorfds: goes to website, scrapes some data, returns it
[04:05] micheil: JesusRosso: I think we may be able to get at ev_unref where ev_is_active() == 0
[04:05] Aria: So in the callback from that, do stuff.
[04:06] halfhalo: I found a vcap module today.  that makes me happy
[04:06] innociv_ has joined the channel
[04:06] lorfds: right...but i have to read the csv file to get the data i want, and then write back to the same row in a new column
[04:06] halfhalo: didn't want to write one myself
[04:06] lorfds: so the scraper is dependent on the csv file
[04:06] micheil: JesusRosso: actually.. maybe not. ev_is_active requires the watcher..
[04:06] Aria: Write back to the same file? Danger, will robinson.
[04:06] lorfds: or diff file
[04:06] lorfds: actually
[04:07] Aria: Yeah, different file. Same file means rewriting the entire remainder of the file from that point.
[04:07] lorfds: so i guess i should store as array
[04:07] Aria: And takes extreme care.
[04:07] lorfds: and only write back when the scraper completes
[04:07] Aria: (since files can't be extended in the middle)
[04:07] lorfds: ok ill mess around a bit
[04:07] micheil: JesusRosso: okay, yeah, I'd like to help more, but I'm reaching the bounds of my knowledge here

[04:08] JesusRosso: micheil, I apreciatte a lot your help.
[04:08] JesusRosso: here is a little late now.

[04:08] halfhalo: ACTION does have a csv file of every city and zip code in the us on his desktop though... that should be fun in the future
[04:10] JesusRosso: micheil, thanks for all the help. I go to sleep now.

[04:46] ryanfitz has joined the channel

[04:57] lorfds: you create that object, load it up with a bunch of function calls, and then they all execute at once and tell you when they're done?
[04:58] lorfds: what does prototype mean
[04:59] benvie: event and callback based code can be well organized
[04:59] maletor has joined the channel
[04:59] benvie: it's not determined by the fact you're using asynchronous programming
[05:00] lorfds: well..part of it is that i suck at it
[05:00] lorfds: bc i havent really done this before
[05:00] lorfds: but it seems confusing as hell
[05:00] lorfds: its feels like following a stray ping pong ball
[05:00] lorfds: you're never quite sure where its going to end up next
[05:00] benvie: it certainly is less straight forward
[05:01] benvie: and usually takes more thought to organize well
[05:01] lorfds: yeah
[05:01] benvie: it's important to use good abstractions to represent what you're doing

[05:02] benvie: building like a standard OOP class hierarchy say in java or whatever is pretty straightforward

[05:03] _unary has joined the channel
[05:04] recycle has joined the channel
[05:04] benvie: in javascript you do better if you learn the benefits of prototypal inheritance, and then the async thing is a whole other thing to work into it
[05:04] sdwrage has left the channel
[05:04] micheil: no.
[05:04] micheil: OOP, functional, prototypal, etc, all work in JS more or less
[05:04] benvie: they do
[05:04] k1ttty has joined the channel
[05:05] micheil: Async just means don't block the event loop, or load long-running work into background jobs
[05:05] benvie: and each has their domain where they shine
[05:05] benvie: well async is a separate factor that adds its own constraints
[05:05] lorfds: what are prototypal inheritances?
[05:05] benvie: on top of whatever problem set you're working with
[05:06] lorfds: just when i think ive got obj c down, this comes along
[05:06] lorfds: i was pretty happy with document.getElementById() as the extent of my js knowledge
[05:06] micheil: benvie: I'd honestly argue that your class / object structure matters jack in javascript, unless you understand the whys and hows and basics first.
[05:07] benvie: yeah I was sort of
[05:07] benvie: basically getting at that
[05:07] micheil: lorfds: ah, good ol' DOM, gotta love selecting an element that's the comment tag in the HTML tree
[05:08] dubenstein has joined the channel
[05:08] lorfds: i love zombie tho
[05:08] lorfds: scraper is pretty bad ass
[05:08] thepatr1ck: micheil: that's fun, you're walking along the dom thinking everything is either a tag or a text node, and then a comment tag comes along and blows everything up. (darn bugs in my own dom walking code)
[05:08] lorfds: thats what pushed me into learning this
[05:08] franciscallo has joined the channel
[05:08] jrogers has joined the channel
[05:09] benvie: was basically getting at that saying that functional or callback or evented coding or whatever as the cause of spaghetti code isn't really getting the point. It's just different in multiple ways for people new to this so it's a combination what makes it hard for them

[05:20] sorensen: which causes errors unless i convert it to pure json
[05:20] Locke23rus has joined the channel
[05:21] justmoon: sorensen, not sure I got your question right, but you basically want to copy the object?
[05:21] sorensen: pretty much, i just cant send it through socket.io as-is
[05:21] sorensen: i want to have my cake and eat it too
[05:22] justmoon: if you call .toObject() it'll give you a plain javascript object copy of the model
[05:22] justmoon: you can modify that and send it out through socket.io
[05:22] justmoon: the original model will be unchanged
[05:22] sorensen: hmmm
[05:22] sorensen: i'm using custom session middleware
[05:22] sorensen: to make express session available to the client via dnode
[05:23] justmoon: so?
[05:23] sorensen: speaking out loud to try and think how to set it via a get

[09:51] mraleph has joined the channel
[09:51] eldios: I fainlly came to the conclusion that kindle is not a good choice for technical manuals
[09:52] eldios: and so think a lot of ppl
[09:53] eldios: some guys on here, some other on stack overflow and in general that's a pretty common opinion: kindle is good for novels and quite uncomfortable to read tech-y manuals
[09:53] eldios: since all those four books (expecially the misterious one which is 659 pages) are quite BIG, using a Kindle could have been a bad choice
[09:54] eldios: so I decided to stick with the paper one.. (other choice would have been to give back amazon ALL those four book and get a kindle instead, where I eventually could get the ebook version of those themselves)
[09:55] TomY has joined the channel
[09:56] booyaa: eldios: the lack of touch screen hurts it (well older gens) especially when searching or naving index/toc
[09:56] eldios: I would buy the kindle 4 basic (no touch)
[09:56] booyaa: also source code presentation is a bit crap too, mind you one solution (as used by uncle bob) was to take screenshots.

[09:58] booyaa: not bad for 4.99 GBP
[09:58] eldios: well I'm not very concerned about PDF since I wuold convert 'em at need with calibre and eventually buy "native" .mobi formats without probelms
[09:58] Glenjamin: i prefer HTML books
[09:58] booyaa: eldios: even with calibre i've rarely been happy with the pdf conversion results.
[09:59] booyaa: i do use calibre to switch from epub to mobi
[09:59] booyaa: it rocks
[09:59] Glenjamin: but IME, programming "books" are no better than tutorials+doing stuff
[09:59] booyaa: also surprisingly good at cracking amazon's drm too

[11:12] kiur: prevent memory leaks ? :)
[11:13] Glenjamin: it's not only caused by leaks :(
[11:13] Glenjamin: its also caused by simply using lots
[11:13] lorfds: jetienne - how would allocating less memory fix it
[11:13] kiur: Hello, i have a little problem. I use MySQL with Node and i need a mysql_escape function. Javascript's escape() is not a solution as it escapes too many chars
[11:13] kiur: so what i've came up with is:
[11:13] kiur: function mysql_escape(str) {
[11:13] kiur: 	str = str.replace(/[\\"'`]/g, '\\$&').replace(/\u0000|\ux1a|\x1a/g, '\\0');
[11:13] kiur: 	str = str.replace(/\r|\n/g, '');
[11:13] kiur: 	return str;
[11:13] kiur: }
[11:13] Glenjamin: lorfds: smaller objects, make sure you dont keep references you dont need around
[11:13] jetienne: lorfds: allocate less memory so you dont run out of memory
[11:14] Glenjamin: kiur: if your mysql library doesn't provide an escape, use another one
[11:14] kiur: can anyone verify my function?
[11:14] lorfds: i am looping to run a scraper....i need to know how to wait/slow down the loop
[11:14] kiur: Glenjamin, that's what im trying to do
[11:14] kiur: im just not a big RegExp expert
[11:14] Glenjamin: kiur: i mean use an existing mysql library
[11:14] Glenjamin: that has a well tested escape function
[11:15] Glenjamin: ideally one that does prepared statements and gets the DB engine to do it

[11:15] samal has left the channel

[11:16] kiur: that's intresting
[11:16] kiur: as Client.prototype.format does not use that method
[11:17] kiur: uses global escape() instead
[11:17] Glenjamin: look at line 146
[11:17] Glenjamin: the code is somewhat misleading
[11:18] quackslike has joined the channel
[11:18] kiur: actually the manual is wrong :P

[11:32] ilya_d: hm so npm which is in 0.6.x is actually installing node_modules in project directory and doesn't mess around with $PREFIX/lib/node_modules/ anymore ?
[11:32] Glenjamin: lorfds: "leak" is an odd way to describe that imo, but the point is that you're keeping references around - so the objects will never be GCed

[11:35] kiur: never mind people, i was feeding it already escape()-d data and was wondering why it escapes "too much" (spaces and ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ chars) :P problem solved
[11:35] lorfds: glenjamin...what do you mean by keeping them around
[11:35] lorfds: you push them into an array that seems to be properly scoped....so i dont understand why GC wont destroy leaks as necessary
[11:36] Glenjamin: lorfds: you're correct there, it doesn't "leak", but because you keep the array around, the objects will never get GCed
[11:36] lorfds: how would you destroy the array?
[11:36] Glenjamin: so every instance will stay in that array, steadily increasing memory usage
[11:36] Glenjamin: delete array;
[11:37] lorfds: is that best practice in node
[11:37] Glenjamin: delete leaks; even
[11:37] lorfds: to delete stuff?
[11:37] Glenjamin: well no
[11:37] Glenjamin: the best practice is don't keep an array around forever
[11:37] lorfds: what does that mean?
[11:37] herbySk has joined the channel
[11:37] kiur: the delete operator is the only true way to remove a variable (of any type)
[11:37] lorfds: i thought in an auto GC environment you didnt have to worry about releasing objects
[11:37] Glenjamin: if you defined the array inside a function, when the function was done with, there are no references to the array left
[11:38] lorfds: you mean no references outside that function?
[11:38] Glenjamin: lorfds: GC means the memory used by objects with no references will be reclaimed, but as long as something has a reference to the object it'll stay
[11:38] Glenjamin: lorfds: yes
[11:39] MCHammel has joined the channel
[11:39] lorfds: so why is it not proper to delete an object when you're done?
[11:39] kiur: i dot it sometimes, never saw a problem

[11:39] Glenjamin: because normally you dont need to
[11:39] kiur: if im not sure that my object will be GC'd then i delete it myself
[11:39] Glenjamin: but in the example there, the variable is attached to the module
[11:39] jonaslund: the delete operator deletes properties
[11:40] kiur: not only properties. var a = "test"; delete a; a; // undefiend
[11:40] jonaslund: x={x:123,y:456}; delete x.x; =>  x={y:456}
[11:41] neurodrone has joined the channel

[11:47] xerox: spicing up debugging
[11:48] MrBenn: the variable x would exist in two places in that

[11:49] satyr has joined the channel
[11:49] Gregor has joined the channel
[11:50] jonaslund: any sane compiler will place the x inside the function either in the functions stack (if it's local to the method) or into the closure if there is functions inside it that refer it (or eval exists in the function or those below it)

[12:52] xerox: because mongoose stores the object not transparently as you'd hope

[13:11] augustl: Glenjamin: ah, yeah, then it's probably not that different really. Buster and mocha is very similar actually. Identical async support, pluggable reporters, bdd and tdd syntax, etc
[13:11] augustl: Glenjamin: hmm, what's zombie?
[13:12] Glenjamin: jsdom wrapper that behaves like a browser
[13:12] Glenjamin: http://zombie.labnotes.org/
[13:12] augustl: Glenjamin: we'll have browser testing via PhantomJS soon-ish
[13:13] gripir has left the channel
[13:13] Glenjamin: not a huge fan of phantom tbh, weird api
[13:13] augustl: the idea is that you have tests that will be executed in a browser. So you don't do anything specifically for phantom
[13:13] Glenjamin: is it actually much faster than a real browser? afaik it's just a Qt WebUIView that's not drawn
[13:13] augustl: buster just replaces phantom with a real browser under the hood
[13:13] augustl: Glenjamin: haha actually google chrome is faster :)
[13:13] xerox: does anybody use 'forever' to restart a program when one saves *.js ?
[13:13] Glenjamin: exactly, making phantom useless :)
[13:13] cmedeiros has joined the channel

[13:14] Vennril has joined the channel
[13:14] Glenjamin: xerox: i use node-dev (via npm)
[13:14] Glenjamin: augustl: makes sense, do you have any docs on what you can make the captured browser do?
[13:15] augustl: Glenjamin: we don't seem to be talking about the same thing :)
[13:15] augustl: basically you can't do anything directly. You write test cases that will be executed in a real browser (or phantom)
[13:16] augustl: then there's http://busterjs.org/docs/buster-capture-server which is the underlying system that is a generic event driven system for browser automation
[13:16] Glenjamin: right
[13:16] Glenjamin: so the idea is to run your unit tests in all browsers, to make sure engine inconsistencies don't break things?

[13:57] pransala1: oh.. :p im guessing i did, github doesnt really make it clear what youre downloading anymore
[13:57] jmar777: pransala1: if so, you definitely want to be compiling a version that's been tagged for release (e.g., current would be 0.6.5)
[13:58] jmar777: pransala1: if you just go to "Downloads", that will be master. you can download a particular tag here: https://github.com/joyent/node/tags
[13:58] jmar777: pransala1: and if you look at the makefile for 0.6.5, you can see that make install *should* work (https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/6cc94db653a2739ab28e33b2d6a63c51bd986a9f/Makefile#L28), so hopefully that'll do it for you

[18:22] TheJH: ryah, thoughts on one node domain per incoming data event for performance analysis? https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/2269

[18:24] ryah: TheJH: domains - like my domains?
[18:24] TheJH: ryah, yes

[18:24] ryah: TheJH: have you showed this to piscisaureus__ 
[18:25] TheJH: ryah, no - I thought you were the one doing all the domains stuff
[18:25] TheJH: ryah, I already built an app that shows all active network conenctions, in/out data events and what in events caused what out events :)
[18:25] ryah: TheJH: piscisaureus__ is taking over because he can write faster code than me

[18:28] ryah: TheJH: probably this week

[18:30] eddyb: preferably with the display/input data tunneled thru socket.io
[18:30] isaacs: TheJH: some fixes for old busted data are making the validate_doc_update function upset

[18:37] robhawkes: I don't really understand gyp, so excuse my questions

[22:47] PPaul: in node.js how do i see my whole object in the console?
[22:47] bnoordhuis: shripadk: that's an odd one, innit?
[22:47] SubStack: mjr_: you should join in on the next nodeup podcast to talk about scaling node!
[22:48] shripadk: bnoordhuis: yeah :P
[22:48] SubStack: if you have the time for it
[22:49] PPaul: console.log is not ouputing my object in a way i can see the whole thing

[22:50] SubStack: mjr_: yep
[22:50] PPaul: thanks
[22:50] bnoordhuis: PPaul: err sorry, that's util.inspect()
[22:50] shripadk: devaholic: ha! :)
[22:50] PPaul: oh
[22:50] mjr_: SubStack: I'd be happy to.  Also, I'll be in SF next week it looks like.

[22:54] SubStack: yep
[22:55] PPaul: i was trying to use it for transforming trees. do you think it would be good for doing complicated tree transformations?
[22:55] PPaul: i got stuck when i was trying to use it to merge parent fields with their children
[22:55] maxogden: PPaul: you should talk to the sierra club

[22:56] PPaul: :)
[22:56] markwubben has joined the channel
[22:56] SubStack: PPaul: you could write a reduce for that

[22:57] PPaul: no good
[22:57] SubStack: PPaul: so you're trying to flatten some nested entries?
[22:58] PPaul: i tried to write some maps, but i found it hard to understand how (i have a functional background too)
[22:58] PPaul: yes i'm flattening
[22:58] PPaul: merging and flattening
[22:58] PPaul: turning a nested tree into an array
[22:58] PPaul: bubbling up from the leaves
[22:59] baudehlo1 has joined the channel
[22:59] SubStack: PPaul: check out the leaves example
[22:59] PPaul: i did
[22:59] PPaul: it got me started
[23:00] PPaul: but i kept running into problems when trying to bubble up my merges
[23:00] PPaul: the leaves example is too simple
[23:00] PPaul: i want my leaves to contain their parents
[23:00] PPaul: so i can remake the tree
[23:01] SubStack: can you gist a snippet of the data structure?
[23:01] PPaul: yes
[23:02] PPaul: https://gist.github.com/1440475
[23:02] PPaul: i've done this many times in clojure, and found it easy with (walk)
[23:03] SubStack: PPaul: and what do you want the result to look like?
[23:03] PPaul: i want the result to look like an array of objects
[23:03] PPaul: just join all the parent fields to their children

[23:06] SubStack: PPaul: the objects with user and password?
[23:07] PPaul: all
[23:07] PPaul: i have filtering functions, but basically i need to merge a parent with it's children
[23:08] SubStack: PPaul: oh the stores parameter? I see
[23:08] PPaul: so, stores -> concat( store1.terminals, store2.terminals....) 
[23:09] PPaul: i'm trying to make a general function that will bubble up terminals, until i have a list of only terminals
[23:09] PPaul: i'll run the transform for stores, groups, and company
[23:10] PPaul: i've been at it for a day, but i'm a bit clueless as to how to use traverse
[23:10] SubStack: one sec
[23:11] jp232 has joined the channel
[23:11] PPaul: i've tried to use this.parent.parent.update, and this.update, but it only works on very simple cases, that i've tried
[23:13] SubStack: PPaul: something like this? https://gist.github.com/1440519
[23:14] SubStack: or should the terminals bubble up all the way?
[23:14] isaacs: who was it that wanted to be able to sort npm search results by last modified date?
[23:14] SubStack: in that case you could just re-run the traversal for the maximum depth of the structure
[23:15] devaholic: isaacs: all of the people
[23:15] isaacs: great
[23:15] isaacs: all fo the people should use node 0.6
[23:15] joshsmith has joined the channel
[23:15] isaacs: ACTION will keep adding candy to npm 1.1
[23:16] PPaul: i need one level of bubble, because there are different rules for each iteration
[23:16] isaacs: just implemented this for npm alpha
[23:16] isaacs: also, regular expression searching
[23:16] SubStack: PPaul: that makes it a bit easier then
[23:16] isaacs: FTMFW.
[23:16] devaholic: noice
[23:16] PPaul: each group should end up having a list of terminals, inststead of stores
[23:17] devaholic: modules with keywords in the module name should also gain authority over those that just have them listed in keywords
[23:17] SubStack: PPaul: so you just want to merge the terminals array with the stores array?
[23:17] SubStack: like a zip?
[23:17] brianseeders has joined the channel
[23:17] SubStack: oh I see, terminals is contained inside of stores
[23:17] PPaul: no, like _.extend(terminal1,store) for each terminal
[23:18] kickingvegas has joined the channel
[23:18] SubStack: aha so you merge each terminal with the parent store?
[23:18] PPaul: so a terminal would have a storeName and number, and each group would have a .terminals
[23:18] PPaul: yes
[23:19] SubStack: you can just check this.key
[23:19] SubStack: if (this.key === 'terminals') this.update(...)
[23:19] mjr_: node friends, it is perhaps obvious, but I will say it again, but Voxer is hiring people to work on node full time.  Let me know if you are interested.
[23:19] PPaul: i was
[23:19] PPaul: merging the data is easy
[23:19] PPaul: bubbling up is tricky
[23:20] SubStack: so you're doing 2 transforms then?
[23:20] PPaul: yes
[23:20] SubStack: oh tricky yeah
[23:20] PPaul: i'm composing transformations
[23:20] SubStack: I would just write those as 2 separate transforms
[23:20] PPaul: i did
[23:20] PPaul: but the bubbling one is throwing errors or just not working at all
[23:21] CarterL has joined the channel

[23:21] madhums has joined the channel
[23:21] SubStack: are you using `this` in a callback?
[23:21] SubStack: var self = this might fix those kinds of errors
[23:22] PPaul: can it be done using the .path function in traverse?
[23:22] kulor-uk has joined the channel
[23:22] SubStack: modifying the .path?
[23:22] PPaul: using the path to make the transformation
[23:23] PPaul: i'm not really sure what the path returns, though
[23:23] PPaul: :|
[23:23] SubStack: just an array of key names
[23:23] SubStack: that you can pass to traverse.get() and traverse.set()

[23:42] Mezriss: Hi. I want to write a script that creates a compressed version of js and css files when they are changed. But what would be the best way to detect changes? fs.watch? Checking last modified date each time when files are accessed? Or comparing hashes? Or checking by timer? Or something else?

[23:43] kickingvegas: mmalecki: looking at dnode; reminds me of xml-rpc (side note: everybody ends up reinventing client-server interactions) 
[23:43] mmalecki: kickingvegas: well, <relevant xkcd here>
[23:44] micheil: kickingvegas: the biggest downside of xml-rpc? the xml part.
[23:44] micheil: (json-rpc is a good alternative)
[23:44] p1d has joined the channel
[23:45] SubStack: dnode is callback rpc
[23:45] SubStack: callbacks all the way down
[23:45] micheil: SubStack: yup.
[23:45] micheil: wasn't trying to down dnode at all there.
[23:45] kickingvegas: SubStack: yep, Node.js idiom
[23:46] SubStack: I mean that's how it's different from xml or json rpc
[23:46] SubStack: it's like json rpc except you can put callbacks in your json
[23:46] SubStack: which completely changes what you can do with it
