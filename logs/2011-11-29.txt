[02:12] matin: I'm just not too good with hardware
[02:12] matin: i typically focus on coding
[02:12] gkatsev: CS is software
[02:12] matin: i know
[02:12] matin: i was talking about figuring out what to get to make a node/php server
[02:13] tbranyen: drop the php and you're golden
[02:13] robertj: just something cheap, seriously, it doesn't matter one iota
[02:13] skunkape has joined the channel
[02:13] gkatsev: matin: just get a free account from joyent. but it depends on what you want to do with the server.
[02:13] matin: I'm using nodejitsu
[02:13] teadict: what's missing for a complete development (ignore alternatives of the same functionality)?: http://paste.ubuntu.com/753248/
[02:14] matin: but I'm coding an ssh/command executor
[02:14] robertj: 99% of your stuff will run a-ok on anything, the other 1% will hit a bottleneck that is application specific and it will be obvious what you should buy mroe of when you have it
[02:14] matin: in node
[02:14] matin: which is meant to be installed on each person's own server
[02:14] matin: but the main reason i need it
[02:14] robertj: and then you spend $5k on 128 gigs of ram and off you go
[02:14] matin: is to host my php application
[02:14] gkatsev: get a VPS?
[02:15] matin: which i plan on getting VC funding for
[02:15] matin: but i don't want to waste the money on a VPS
[02:15] robertj: you could also look int an amazon EC2 micro instance
[02:15] maxogden: i'd buy a 'i got vc for ram' tshirt
[02:15] gkatsev: can't say it's really wasting...
[02:15] jsurfer has joined the channel
[02:15] gkatsev: also, prgmr is really cheap
[02:15] nicholasf: ec2 micro instances grind when you type ls -ltrh  in the /tmp dir
[02:16] nicholasf: too low on resources
[02:16] matin: i'd rather be able to hold on to my own server
[02:16] robertj: gkatsev, I've been very happy with linode for my stuff
[02:16] robertj: i've got one personal linode and 2 i use for work
[02:16] jocafa has joined the channel
[02:17] gkatsev: robertj: yeah, linode is good. prgmr is life half price. though, apparently, the prices went up by like a dollar or two since the last time I looked
[02:17] robertj: when I was in highschool I had a shell on a Microsoft box
[02:17] robertj: I'm afraid those days are probably gone
[02:17] gkatsev: and I guess there is also 2host, which is, um... idk. it's cheap but idk how good it is. tmzt uses it
[02:17] materialdesigner has joined the channel
[02:18] matin: should i just get a bare bone or something?
[02:18] matin: even though i don't know wtf that is haha
[02:18] gkatsev: bare bones mean you can change out parts and shit
[02:18] robertj: matin, it probably means no disk drives and no optical drives
[02:18] Destos has joined the channel
[02:18] gkatsev: anyway, if you want to keep the server in your house, you might as well just basically build a desktop.
[02:19] matin: alright
[02:19] matin: gkatsev, how do i do that
[02:19] gkatsev: get a case a motherboard some HDDs a nic.
[02:19] robertj: for most purposes a server is the same hardware as a desktop but you want RAID 1 and a redundant PSU
[02:19] robertj: gkatsev, don't get a nic
[02:19] gkatsev: lol
[02:19] matin: robertj, sadly i don't know what RAID is
[02:19] matin: i've heard of it
[02:20] robertj: gkatsev, the $200 NICs Dell sells have the same ethernet chipset that comes on-board on almost all their kit and it's probbalyb the same almost everwhere else
[02:20] davidascher has joined the channel
[02:20] pauls1 has joined the channel
[02:20] gkatsev: robertj: yeah, nic is probably not needed. but my desktop needed a wireless nic.
[02:20] matin: nic?
[02:20] robertj: matin, you get 2 disk drives and they show up as one so if one dies the other keeps working
[02:20] gkatsev: network interface controller
[02:20] robertj: aka network card
[02:20] matin: ah ok
[02:21] matin: any estimate for how much a basic server
[02:21] matin: would cost me
[02:21] gkatsev: RAID Redundant Array of Independent Disks http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID
[02:21] robertj: matin, seriously buy the cheapest thing you can with 2 gigs of ram off craigs list and just back it up and buy another when it breaks
[02:21] gkatsev: matin: how much money do you want to spend
[02:21] gkatsev: ?
[02:21] robertj: how much linux experience do you have?
[02:21] gkatsev: you could probably pull one off
[02:21] stantona has joined the channel
[02:22] matin: i have some linux experience
[02:22] gkatsev: robertj: that doesn't matter. he can learn as he goes along.
[02:22] matin: i was planning on sticking with ubuntu
[02:22] gkatsev: assuming he is willing to learn.
[02:22] robertj: ok, because if you don't have much that makes linode a much better idea because you can wipe and restart in like 5 min
[02:22] matin: i am
[02:22] matin: i've gotten better robertj :)
[02:22] jaequery has joined the channel
[02:22] matin: gkatsev i was planning on a max of ~$250
[02:23] robertj: do you have a nice desktop already? If so you can host your own virtual server with virtual box or vmware server
[02:23] Aria: $250 won't get you good power supplies.
[02:23] brianloveswords has joined the channel
[02:23] matin: lol actually i dont
[02:23] Aria: But it will get you a performing machine in a cheaptastic case.
[02:23] gkatsev: one time, I reinstalled linux on my desktop 3 times in the span of like 30 minutes
[02:23] matin: im on a lapto
[02:23] matin: laptopp
[02:23] gkatsev: matin: can you spare double that?
[02:23] robertj: OK screw that, buy yourself a nice desktop and install virtualbox or libvirt on it depending on your preferred desktop of choice
[02:23] robertj: (or a nice laptop, either will work)
[02:23] matin: well I'm on a macbook
[02:23] matin: pro
[02:23] robertj: how much ram you got?
[02:24] matin: that's why my cash for the server was diluted
[02:24] gkatsev: I would go with a desktop, they can be beefier for the same price
[02:24] matin: on my mac?
[02:24] robertj: yes
[02:24] mcluskydodallas has joined the channel

[02:25] matin: all day
[02:25] robertj: put the $80 SSD in, buy an external drive to backup your vms, and buy a copy of whatever virtualization solution you like
[02:25] Aria: Virtual machines are a tad sluggish but very workable. I have a virtual server with plenty of resources for $50/mo, and I've a $200 machine (nettop) on my home cable connection that I can test stuff on.

[02:26] nodebiscut has joined the channel

[02:26] matin: http://mailinator.com/displayemail.jsp?email=nodejshw&msgid=6019577
[02:26] matin: but i think i forgot a HD
[02:26] Aria: matin: my home server is 1.6ghz Atom.  2GB RAM. Macbook Air, 2GB RAM, 128GB SSD.
[02:26] robertj: Aria, in my experience slow vms are 100% due to disk io almost always, that's why I suggested he grab a ssd
[02:27] Aria: robertj: That depends on the VM. But yes.
[02:27] matin: wait you're using a macbook air as a server?
[02:27] gkatsev: matin: make sure the case can fit a micro atx mobo.
[02:27] matin: micro atx mobo?
[02:27] Aria: No, that's my dev machine.
[02:28] Aria: Motherboard.
[02:28] gkatsev: matin: motherboard. in the mailinator link, you posted
[02:28] robertj: Aria, at work the only reason I didn't put in an SSD was that ram is so cheap when you have all those slots that it didn't make sense
[02:28] Aria: Yeah. Same here.
[02:28] gkatsev: the mobo you chose is a micro ATX
[02:28] Aria: I've got 8GB at work.
[02:28] robertj: so instead i just have so much ram the disks really never get to spin + 1gig nvram
[02:28] gkatsev: so, make sure the case can house it.
[02:28] Aria: Almost every case can manage microatx
[02:28] matin: oh
[02:28] robertj: 64 on my virt server
[02:28] gkatsev: Aria: yes, it probably can, but better double check before hand.
[02:28] matin: i have no idea how to check anything lol

[02:29] matin: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811192070
[02:29] Aria: matin: That's a cheap machine, but very workable. It's nothing special, and certainly not server-quality reliability. Great for a dev machine you can just rebuild if it dies.
[02:29] matin: thats the case
[02:29] maxogden: sysadmin: can't be that hard!
[02:29] gkatsev: matin: check the specs.
[02:29] Aria: And that's a MicroATX case.
[02:29] robertj: As a student you don't want reliability, you want to learn to back up
[02:29] gkatsev: yes, that case is good
[02:29] matin: ok
[02:29] matin: so do i get a HD?
[02:29] robertj: when buying a case the main thing you want is for it to come with a good PSU typically
[02:29] gkatsev: HDD?
[02:29] sdwrage has joined the channel
[02:30] Aria: Yeah, you'd need a hard disk.
[02:30] robertj: matin, if you can at all afford that $80 and can get your parents to use an AMEX so that you can quality for the rebate get that SSD
[02:30] Aria: robertj: Or to be so cheap you can replace the PSU without thinking ;-)
[02:30] matin: that bundle is from new egg's complete solution
[02:30] Aria: Honestly, if I were just starting to develop? I'd go to the local computer junk store and buy whatever's $100.
[02:30] robertj: If you can wait and don't mind non-intel stuff, Raspberry pi will be available in January in a good qty
[02:31] robertj: Aria, I recommended a laptop with a broken LCD off craiglist

[02:48] robertj: seriously, buy a http://www.raspberrypi.org/ a month from now
[02:48] Aria: (Since if it runs fast one at a time in 64mb, then it'll run REALLY fast 100 at a time in 64GB)
[02:48] Aria: But yes. Raspberry Pi is neat hardware.
[02:48] matin: what's that
[02:48] Aria: And cheap.
[02:49] matin: what's raspberry pi
[02:49] matin: the more i look at their blog

[02:50] matin: lol i just saw that
[02:50] robertj: they will be out in Jan
[02:50] joshwnj: so cheap, worth getting one even if u don't need it :P
[02:50] robertj: there will be teaser amounts avaialble in Dec
[02:50] gkatsev: I think they will probably be double that.

[02:57] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: yeah, he's wiring up run-for-cover to node-tap
[02:57] matin: so
[02:57] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: with reports and stuff
[02:57] tjholowaychuk: isaacs will it be generic enough for other libs to use?
[02:57] matin: are there any notable differences between debian and ubuntu
[02:57] gkatsev: Aria: but didn't ubuntu add to debian so, so, ubuntu would be a superset of debian?

[02:57] tjholowaychuk: and finally ditch jscov

[02:59] tjholowaychuk:  matin 24
[02:59] matin: ah ok
[02:59] tjholowaychuk: isaacs cool thanks i'll check it out
[02:59] Aria: matin: 29.

[03:01] Aria: raspberry isn't out yet.
[03:01] isaacs: the problem is that the human brain measures time relatively, so the older you get, the smaller the years ae.
[03:01] isaacs: *are
[03:01] Aria: But v8 works on arm, it works on the palm pre -- so I expect it'll get there real fast.
[03:01] isaacs: the difference between 30 and 35 is quite a bit less than the difference between 6 and 7
[03:01] wookiehangover: tjholowaychuk: but the real question is, can you grow a neck-beard?

[04:00] Aria: fileName? I've never seen that before.
[04:00] Aria: What systems do fill that in?
[04:01] mattrobenolt: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error
[04:01] Aria: "non-standard" is code for "someone in Firefox added this."
[04:01] mattrobenolt: I mean, I know it's Mozilla's reference, but wasn't sure how it was handled in V8. I couldn't find anything really according to them.
[04:01] Aria: Yeah, V8 mostly follows the ECMA spec.
[04:01] Aria: Which is a painfully boring read. And a terrible reference.
[04:02] amigojapan has joined the channel
[04:02] mattrobenolt: Yeah, that's kinda what I assumed. Either way, is there a simple way to just grab the filename from the error?
[04:02] Aria: No. Parse the stack.
[04:02] mattrobenolt: What's actually building the stack? Is that internal to V8, I'm assuming?
[04:02] Aria: Yeah.

[04:24] JakeyChan: hi ? question about code design 
[04:25] tjholowaychuk: mattrobenolt im not very familar with any py stuff
[04:25] mattrobenolt: It runs on another server completely, and hooks directly into Python's logger so it kicks out stack traces and everything over to this external system, which you can log into their GUI and browse around all the errors.
[04:25] mattrobenolt: It supports throttling, sampling, etc.
[04:26] mattrobenolt: I'm writing a Node version of the client and a Connect middleware.
[04:26] JakeyChan: I need data that is returned by asynchronous, when fetched data, I use callback to tell caller data is ready and caller can get the data, but in the callback, caller still need another data that also is returned by asynchronous;

[04:29] secoif: JakeyChan specifically 'parallel'
[04:29] mattrobenolt: And each message logged in Sentry has a UUID associated with it, so you can spit that error number out on a 500 page so it can be referenced to the exact stack trace in Sentry.
[04:30] JakeyChan: secoif: but it's not good solution I think. we need perfect design, not use module to append our project

[05:03] drwonoski: anyone help me out with node?
[05:03] mattrobenolt: Right, but how often is that, really? I think it can make it's best guess, and let it fail silently if no host can be found.

[06:07] dezmaeth: hey guys, im triying to get forever working but it fails everytime i start a script
[06:07] jacobolus has joined the channel
[06:07] dezmaeth: and using nohup i get this error : TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'cursorTo' 
[06:08] dezmaeth: but if i start using just node , works perfectly
[06:08] dezmaeth: the script requires socket.io module
[06:08] dezmaeth: any clues? not much info on this on google
[06:09] monokrome: Since they're asyncronous, if I do four writes to a file - do they arrive in order?
[06:10] abraxas: monokrome: i'm not sure, but i suggest you use callbacks accordingly
[06:10] monokrome: ?
[06:10] zilch_ has joined the channel
[06:10] abraxas: monokrome: ? :)
[06:10] jjd has joined the channel
[06:11] monokrome: "use callbacks accordingly" seems a bit vague
[06:11] dezmaeth: any other way to set as background process a node script ? without forever, that just fails miserably ?
[06:11] jackbean has joined the channel
[06:11] abraxas: monokrome: if you're using asynchronous filesystem api, you'll want to probably use the callback of each operation to spawn the next operation.
[06:12] jjd has joined the channel
[06:12] monokrome: abraxas: Sure, if that's possible. It's not in this case.
[06:12] dezmaeth: monokrome: filesystems are usually on first in first out basis, so i presume it will require callbacks
[06:12] abraxas: monokrome: how's that?
[06:12] pitlimit has joined the channel
[06:12] monokrome: abraxas: Because it's the same callback over and over again
[06:12] pitlimit: If I call a function can I be certain there are no race conditions on shared structures?
[06:13] sdwrage has joined the channel
[06:13] abraxas: pitlimit: yes, javascript is a single thread eventloop

[06:16] amigojapan has joined the channel
[06:16] monokrome: abraxas: And it's also a prototype, and a cake build step, and not for production
[06:16] monokrome: So, I'm not too worried.
[06:16] abraxas: monokrome: as far as i know, nodejs has a thread pool to do these kind of operations, and if you have 2 writes on 2 separate threads, you can't say for sure in which order the cpu ends up scheduling the writes.
[06:16] monokrome: I'll rewrite it once I know it works.
[06:16] ecin has joined the channel
[06:16] monokrome: abraxas: They're coming in in proper order for now
[06:17] abraxas: monokrome: i think it will work fine 99.x% of the time :)
[06:17] abraxas: if that's good enough in your case.. why not :)
[06:17] monokrome: prototype, being rewritten, and not for production? It's okay for now.
[06:18] monokrome: I think it'll be fine unless some OS schedules the I/O unusually
[06:18] cognominal has joined the channel
[06:19] Heisenmink has joined the channel
[06:20] abraxas: well, like i said, if both operations are being pushed on a separate thread, all guarantees go out the window
[06:20] monokrome: They're not
[06:20] abraxas: a system under heavy load may become funky
[06:20] luke` has joined the channel
[06:20] abraxas: how do you know?
[06:20] monokrome: Because this is node?
[06:20] abraxas: node internally has a thread pool for these kinds of operations
[06:20] abraxas: if the OS provides no async way to do certain operations, node pushes them on a thread pool
[06:20] isaacs: it's awesome when npm's test fails, because it says "This is most likely a problem with the npm package, and not npm itself"
[06:21] isaacs: then it tells me to contact the author

[06:26] beseku: Hey all. I'm coming to Node from Rails and before that PHP/CodeIgniter. I'm messing about with the express framework, (with the resourceful routing monkey patch) so I have my routing/controllers and views worked out. Whats the done thing in terms of moddeling data/databases in Node.js? Is there an Active Record style implementation?
[06:27] SamuraiJack has joined the channel
[06:27] beseku: I'd rather work with MySQL as we have a server built for databases, but this whole thing is experimental so other opinions are welcomed.

[12:19] tonymilne: expresso == test framework, you might mean express.
[12:19] tonymilne: you should use express + mongoose (mongodb), in my opinion.
[12:19] Wizek has joined the channel
[12:19] tonymilne: then just pick a templating module, like jade / els, etc.

[12:20] Aragorn_Guardian: is stable enough to run in a prodution server?

[12:21] cryptix: duschendestroyer: what other files could there be?

[12:31] topaxi_: The output from jsmad is NOT representative of the output quality of libmad itself. jsmad hasn't been tested for ISO/IEC 11172-4 computational accuracy requirements compliance.

[15:35] mattrobenolt: Any safe async way to do this: https://gist.github.com/e088935c4af5dfa7389e
[15:36] joshkehn: Sure
[15:36] joshkehn: Do an async read, collect each file, callback
[15:36] mattrobenolt: Right, I guess I'm just trying to wrap my logic around the recursive callbacks needed in the async calls.
[15:36] eddyb: mattrobenolt: have a counter
[15:37] joshkehn: There shouldn't be any recursion.
[15:37] joshkehn: var num_files = files.length;
[15:37] eddyb: var callbacksLeftToGet = files.length;
[15:37] aheckmann has joined the channel
[15:37] joshkehn: if (--num_files === 0) { // callback }
[15:37] eddyb: decrease it with every callback got
[15:37] eddyb: if zero, call main callback
[15:37] eddyb: joshkehn: heh
[15:37] mattrobenolt: But that won't retain order.
[15:37] mattrobenolt: Well, guaranteed to retain order.
[15:38] tih-ra: I finished the beta version of my module (alleup) Flexible way to resize and upload images to Amazon S3 or file system storages for Node.js (https://github.com/tih-ra/alleup). Is Possible to add different versions of the same image in cropped or resized variants. And now if there is willing to Contributors, you are welcome. I plan to add a upload not only image but other types of files with a prior processing on the server. 
[15:38] joshkehn: mattrobenolt: You could pass an order to the callback function and slot it into an array to maintain order.
[15:38] mattrobenolt: joshkehn: I'm basically trying to do this:
[15:38] mattrobenolt: fs.readFile(file[0], function(){
[15:38] mattrobenolt:     fs.readFile(file[1], ...)

[15:39] wereHamster: env.HOME
[15:39] wereHamster: secoif: ^^^
[15:39] mattrobenolt: joshkehn: Ahh, I see. Is that really the best way?
[15:39] eddyb: process.env.HOME
[15:39] joshkehn: Better then recursively reading files.

[15:39] mattrobenolt: joshkehn: I'm writing a stacktrace parser, and I'm reading in each file of the stacktrace to determine the lines of context.
[15:39] brianloveswords has joined the channel
[15:40] mattrobenolt: So for each frame of the stack, I'm reading in the file, grabbing the lines around the error.
[15:40] mattrobenolt: So each file read needs to be directly associated with a frame of the stack.
[15:40] joshkehn: Okay… so why can't you async read them?
[15:40] joshkehn: I don't see an issue with that really.
[15:41] mattrobenolt: I can, I'm just having trouble with the logic to read all the files recursively.
[15:41] joshkehn: mattrobenolt: Async, not recursive
[15:41] mattrobenolt: Here's basically what I have now: https://gist.github.com/fd02f52c7151eaf61a69
[15:42] fmeyer has joined the channel
[15:42] mattrobenolt: So I'm looping over each line of the stacktrace, getting the filename the error spawned from. Then reading it in, parsing the appropriate lines, then moving to the next.
[15:42] mattrobenolt: My background is Python, so this async stuff is a little odd to get ahold of.
[15:42] mattrobenolt: And ignore the callback, it's not really doing anything.
[15:43] joshkehn: lines.forEach(function (line) {
[15:43] joshkehn:     var file = extractFileName(line);
[15:43] joshkehn:     readFileForLine(line, file);

[15:44] visudo has joined the channel
[15:44] joshkehn: mattrobenolt: readFileForLine would async read the file and push it into a map where you have { line : file_contents }

[15:45] joshkehn: Anonymous recursion FTW
[15:45] burningdog has joined the channel
[15:45] eddyb: don't use arguments, please :)
[15:45] mattrobenolt: Then how do I call the master callback?
[15:45] joshkehn: mattrobenolt: Inc a counter
[15:45] mattrobenolt: haha, that recursive is what's killing my brain right now.
[15:45] joshkehn: It's not recursive.
[15:45] joshkehn: Don't think of it as recursive.
[15:45] joshkehn: ;)
[15:45] burningdog has left the channel
[15:46] joshkehn: eddyb: Only if you don't know what you're doing. ;) 
[15:46] eddyb: so var x = function foo(a){if(!a)foo(1);}; x();/* works */ foo();/*fails*/
[15:46] joshkehn: Honestly I've never had to use arguments.callee 
[15:46] JasonJS: joshkehn: I get that, but when I'm defining a callback function that I'm going to be providing to another async function, does it matter which I use?

[15:46] joshkehn: So I ignore it.
[15:47] joshkehn: JasonJS: Not really
[15:47] joshkehn: JasonJS: Though the named functions will give much better stacktraces
[15:47] eddyb: JasonJS: also, you can name and assign a function
[15:47] mattrobenolt: I think I get it. One minute.
[15:48] eddyb: I've been (almost) always doing this:
[15:48] eddyb: Class.prototype.do = function do(){};
[15:48] joshkehn: JasonJS: You can also name inline functions fs.readFile(…, function file_read () {})
[15:48] eddyb: since I learned that the name appears in the stacktrace
[15:48] joshkehn: eddyb: That's a great style to embrace.
[15:48] joshkehn: I do that for all my stuff as well.

[16:21] fuzzled: is there currently a tool/site to up vote/downvote a pull request ? i.e., we see a lot of +1 on comments etc on github but ...
[16:21] secoif: Raynos write a post on anything but a blog. using node for a blog is like using a spaceship as a towel rack. Sure, it can do it but it's not exactly the most sexy application of the tool.
[16:22] fuzzled: secoif: yeah but it's kind of like the hello world of apps
[16:22] joshkehn: fuzzled: It's still dumb.
[16:22] fuzzled: and like hello world, its used to demonstrate features and a gentle intro vs. a practical application
[16:22] MatthewS has joined the channel
[16:22] joshkehn: Here's the difference.
[16:22] joshkehn: Hello world is a few lines
[16:22] joshkehn: A blog is much more.
[16:23] yenz: +1
[16:23] yenz: Raynos: do it
[16:23] fuzzled: +1, true.
[16:23] scttnlsn: Number(x) vs. parseInt(x)...what's the difference?
[16:23] wereHamster: secoif: string.replace ?
[16:23] wereHamster: scttnlsn: vs ~~x
[16:24] secoif: scttnlsn Number(x) will try convert any object to a number eg the string "0.2" -> the number 0.2
[16:24] joshkehn: Blogging engines themselves are dumb ideas.
[16:24] secoif: parseInt will force it to an integer
[16:24] secoif: ie
[16:24] joshkehn: Using Node to write one is downright impractical. 
[16:24] Xano has joined the channel
[16:24] secoif: parseInt('0.2') == 0
[16:25] secoif: I don't even think blog is something node is particularly strong at, so it's not showcasing it's best side

[16:26] JakeyChan has joined the channel
[16:26] secoif: I still don't understand
[16:26] joshkehn: fuzzled: I'm a little fuzzy
[16:27] secoif: scttnlsn you should use the node repl
[16:27] secoif: scttnlsn to try these things out 
[16:27] joshkehn: Can you clarify how your company using a blogging engine relates to writing a tutorial for creating a blogging engine in node?
[16:27] secoif: scttnlsn got to your commandline and type node
[16:27] secoif: scttnlsn and play
[16:28] secoif: scttnlsn and hope you don't throw any errors after you've spent 3 minutes setting up testing vars
[16:28] yenz: aggro tuesday

[16:28] secoif: wereHamster i guess that's pretty simple eh
[16:28] secoif: wereHamster thanks
[16:29] CoverSlide: you know who likes blogging engines? HITLER ! (--force Godwin)
[16:29] fuzzled: "joshkehn: Blogging engines themselves are dumb ideas."
[16:29] fuzzled: you mean a nodes blogging engine -
[16:29] fuzzled: nodejs*
[16:29] Raynos: joshkehn: secoif: I know, it's not very exciting but I wanted to write a blog from scratch, and I have done and I use it. And it might be useful to tell people what I learned about doing that
[16:29] joshkehn: Raynos: Point out the those things.
[16:30] Raynos: its not so much about writing a blog more about "here's how I've written a website with node"
[16:30] fuzzled: Raynos: you should write one on writing a module with proper unit tests
[16:30] dezmaeth: ok , so i got the   "TypeError: Cannot call method 'reset' of undefined", i've trying uninstalling node, npm,  everything, reinstalling, installing older versions, everything, wtf?
[16:30] joshkehn: Sure, fine. Just don't start from the blogging engine standpoint.
[16:30] Raynos: fuzzled: well I do plan to rewrite the blog step by step with 100% unit test coverage and focus on doing this TDD
[16:30] secoif: fuzzled it's simple. don't write a line of production code that doesn't already have a test for it 
[16:30] joshkehn: fuzzled: I think all blog “engines” suck to some degree.
[16:30] dezmaeth: i am asking on the wrong place?
[16:30] Raynos: Its not a blog engine, its a website
[16:31] joshkehn: secoif: That doubles your time to market
[16:31] joshkehn: Test where it's helpful, not always.
[16:31] dezmaeth: this is the full error
[16:31] dezmaeth: https://gist.github.com/1402515
[16:31] fuzzled: and joshkehn as Raynos says its a website, a blog engine is a big piece of software
[16:31] joshkehn: Otherwise you test for tests sake.
[16:31] secoif: joshkehn that halves the time you spend fucking around after you launch
[16:31] CoverSlide: write the test first
[16:31] fuzzled: +1 CoverSlide 
[16:31] Raynos: joshkehn: I test for refactoribility
[16:31] fuzzled: BDD
[16:31] Raynos: I mean I dont do 100% test coverage of my units
[16:31] isaacs: dezmaeth: can you gist the code that oyu're seeing that in?
[16:31] Raynos: but I have tested my entire http api and it really helps
[16:32] joshkehn: secoif: Completely depends on what you're changing. 
[16:32] isaacs: dezmaeth: the smaller the reproducible example, the bette.

[16:51] isaacs: kenperkins: npm is a set of tools, which you can use however you like, really.  some people find it useful to use some aspects of npm in production, others find it easier to use something like chef to just push things into place, etc.

[16:51] isaacs: kenperkins: use whatever works.
[16:51] isaacs: kenperkins: npm's primary use-case is to make development easier.
[16:51] kenperkins: thx for the comment
[16:51] kenperkins: that's what we do: use puppet to push a "blessed" tarball to our node boxes

[16:52] isaacs: kenperkins: you could, of course, go full-on with npm.  run your own private registry, and do installs from that, so you only push "blessed" packages into it.
[16:52] brianc: dezmaeth: you could use tmux or screen for that :p
[16:52] isaacs: kenperkins: and maybe even set up a build/staging server that listens on teh _changes feed, and automatically installs and tests on each push

[17:04] brianc: dezmaeth: basically you start screen/tmux and it gives you a console.  you do whatever you want in that console.  when you disconnect SSH the console stays running because screen/tmux is running as a service in the background
[17:04] brianc: dezmaeth: once you SSH back into the box you can "reattach" to your open console in screen/tmux

Wrapper modules on JavaScript with zero C / C++ code. But there is no Windows port for node-ffi, or is there? I guess libffi was never Win32-ported.
[17:19] CoverSlide: I doubt it would be
[17:20] CoverSlide: i'm not sure if there are any windows ports for compiled modules yet
[17:20] CoverSlide: or if that's even supported yet
[17:22] joshkehn has left the channel
[17:23] Mithgol: The whole system suddenly feels like Firefox. For two reasons. First, everything is javascriptable. Second, most of the platform's power resides in extension modules.

[17:25] CoverSlide: djMax: just a guess here, but maybe try putting spaces before and after FOO
[17:25] MatthewS has joined the channel
[17:26] djMax: it's something more insidious. If I render the view I use for a working controller, it also renders the code instead

[17:27] tjholowaychuk: ?
[17:28] mmalecki: christophsturm: no
[17:28] tjholowaychuk: ejs has an option for open / closing things
[17:28] mmalecki: christophsturm: port your module/harass other authors
[17:28] djMax: res.render('myview', {locals:{open:1}}); will render the code of myview
[17:28] gregpascale has joined the channel
[17:28] CoverSlide: christophsturm: change all 'sys' to 'util'. easy breezy. and tell the module author

[17:35] perezd has joined the channel

[17:36] tjholowaychuk: i changed jade to use __

[17:36] tjholowaychuk: there's no end
[17:36] tjholowaychuk: johnnywengluu yeah
[17:36] johnnywengluu: so tests are run when files are changed

[17:48] eldios: at 20?
[17:48] eldios: I am returning at 4
[17:48] CoverSlide: if you're recursing you need to return
[17:48] CoverSlide: otherwise the first function will not return anything

[20:00] jondot: hi guys. i was reading some node.js projects' code, and i notice many projects shell out. for example to remove a file many projects exec 'rm'. or call some binary to achieve a certain functionality that I typically see within a language's stdlib. why is that?
[20:00] ljackson: eeemsi tho you prob don't want it in your loop to see it n-1 socket times
[20:00] eeemsi: ljackson: the problem is that that prints <Buffer 61 73 64 66 0d 0a> instead of asdf
[20:01] ljackson: eeemsi Buffer object has a toString method just call that
[20:01] Fabryz has joined the channel

[20:08] innociv_: " Object function EventEmitter() { } has no method 'setMaxListeners'" from "require('events').EventEmitter.setMaxListeners(50);"
[20:08] innociv_:  What.
[20:08] beawesomeinstead has joined the channel
[20:08] innociv_: Same with require('events').setMaxListeners(50);
[20:09] insin has joined the channel
[20:09] eeemsi: ljackson: another idea?
[20:09] ljackson: innociv_, you want to change the global max listeners ? or on a instance of an object that inherits from EventEmitter ?
[20:09] innociv_: Global max listeners
[20:09] ljackson: eeemsi what ya got
[20:10] ljackson: innociv_, you look at node.js library source ? what version you working on 
[20:11] jondot: ljackson: i just thought maybe this is the way to do things and stay out of the event loop
[20:11] ljackson: jondot, the fs module is async so as long as you have a callback it won't effect the event loop
[20:11] chapel: innociv_: as far as I can tell, setMaxListeners is only for an instance of EE
[20:12] jondot: ljackson: can i show you the chunk of code i was reading?
[20:12] ljackson: innociv_, that is what it is EventEmitter.prototype.setMaxListeners = function(n) {
[20:12] ljackson: jondot sure whats the PB

[20:13] jondot: looks like he downloaded files using curl, rm'd a bit and 'mkdir'ed a bit aswell.
[20:13] ljackson: eeemsi, lol really?
[20:13] garrensmith has joined the channel
[20:14] jondot: i accept that imagemagick is done using shell exec. i've seen this many times also in ruby.
[20:14] eeemsi: its just for fun ;)
[20:14] braoru has joined the channel
[20:15] djbell has joined the channel
[20:15] ljackson: jondot, yeah since he is shelling out to the imagemagick library rather than using a native binding the author just used the same shell wrappers rather than the fs module
[20:15] lzskiss has joined the channel
[20:15] innociv_: ljackson, 0.6.something
[20:15] __t has joined the channel
[20:16] ljackson: jondot more like what is your use case and deps, but as a general rule use the fs module for file manip rather than a shell command :)

[20:16] koo2 has joined the channel
[20:16] innociv_: I don't really get it. I'm looking at http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.6.1/api/events.html#emitter.setMaxListeners
[20:16] ljackson: innociv_, yeah must change it on the instance of the object with EE
[20:16] jondot: ljackson: i'm going to re-implement this with a subset of the functionality (because its not maintained so much). do you think i should shell out or should have this be done with stdlib?
[20:16] innociv_: EE?
[20:16] ljackson: innociv_, EventEmitter
[20:17] Doidel__ has joined the channel
[20:17] innociv_: What is emitter.setMaxListeners() for then?
[20:17] ljackson: jondot I would do everything possible with the nodejs stdlib, include the network io or anything else 
[20:17] ambroff has joined the channel
[20:17] innociv_: If not to actually set the max listeners.
[20:17] innociv_: globally.
[20:17] jondot: ok, cool.
[20:17] jmeed has joined the channel
[20:17] ljackson: innociv_, well it is EventEmitter.prototype.setMaxListeners = function(n) {
[20:18] innociv_: What would be in the function?...
[20:18] ljackson: innociv_, which means it is a method of an instance with that prototype and not a static method
[20:18] JasonSmith has joined the channel
[20:18] ljackson: innociv_, see the source for how it works it clearly shows that it is setting this._maxListeners = n; which would require an instance to have "this"
[20:18] dnyy has joined the channel
[20:18] innociv_: I'm confused.  Why is there a doc on this that says that you can instance emitter and set that function to increase the max emitters, but it doesn't actually increase the max emitters?
[20:19] ljackson: innociv_, it does
[20:19] ljackson: innociv_, but only on the new object that extends or is an EventEmitter
[20:19] Doidel__: Hello guys. What's that: Same websites, two domains (dev and live server) but always the same nodejs server. When I establish a connection from the dev server I can emit and receive messages. Doing that with the live server website (but with same socket.io stuff) I get a connection & heartbeats, but I can't emit data. What could that be?
[20:19] ljackson: Doidel__, firewall ?
[20:20] Doidel__: same nodejs server. same client
[20:20] mattrobenolt has left the channel
[20:20] Doidel__: => no
[20:20] ljackson: Doidel__, well HB would clear a FW true... 
[20:20] Doidel__: it's actually everything the same, just that I call the socket.emit from another domain
[20:20] ljackson: Doidel__, oh!
[20:20] ljackson: Doidel__, you allowing for crossdomain javascript ?
[20:20] Doidel__: but from that other domain I can connect and send and receive heartbeats
[20:21] Doidel__: the dev server already is another domain, so: yes.
[20:21] Doidel__: and I also use the same port
[20:21] Doidel__: as said, it's all the same...
[20:21] ljackson: Doidel__, I forget where but depending on what your browser is negotiating it could be a flash policy 
[20:21] blissdev has joined the channel
[20:21] Doidel__: I tried with 4 different browsers. It's everywhere the same
[20:22] niftylettuce has joined the channel
[20:22] jondot: any idea why imagemagick doesn't have native node.js bindings? is it because its leaky? is there anything else anyone prefers?
[20:23] ljackson: Doidel__, you sure the event is being emitted over socket.io ? that is try a tcpdump/wireshark ?
[20:23] tih-ra has joined the channel
[20:23] zomg: btw has anyone tried socket.io based sites on the iOS browser?
[20:24] Doidel__: it's not. well, I directly call socket.emit() e.g. with firebug, that seems to work. I get no error. But the server debug logs show me that nothing was received
[20:24] whoops has joined the channel
[20:24] Doidel__: except the heartbeats
[20:24] trose has joined the channel
[20:24] zomg: I recently tried it but it seemed to not work, could've been some other issue though since I didn't look into it that much
[20:24] ljackson: jondot, mostly i would guess because the lib is not fun to work with the API can be hell and nodejs is mostly if not all c++ so the wrapper would spend a lot of time dealing with the c layer, tho long time since I looked at IM
[20:25] ljackson: Doidel__, well only think I can say is pastebin something we can look at cause it sounds like a subtle bug :P
[20:25] raincole has joined the channel
[20:25] Doidel__: ok
[20:25] Doidel__: will do
[20:25] ljackson: Doidel__, you sure your listing to the exact event name on the server side ? no typos or side effects of dev vs prod in event name...etc.?
[20:26] Doidel__: 1:1 copy
[20:26] neurodrone has joined the channel
[20:26] Doidel__: it's really copy, paste :)
[20:26] Doidel__: I'll make a pastebin
[20:26] jondot: ljackson: i'm also wondering. how acceptable is this when the web process spawns such shell processes to do its work? i've seen it on various problems, but since i'm relatively new to this stack i don't have a good intuition. it feels dirty
[20:26] Doidel__: but thanks already for your assistance
[20:26] ljackson: Doidel__, humm well lets see what it looks like I guess, copy and paste can be the death of code
[20:27] ljackson: jondot, it is the Unix way (tm) but yeah not really the node.js way i guess like anything I guess don't abuse shell processes for both security and sanity

[20:35] clithe has joined the channel
[20:35] ljackson: Doidel__, also it looks like your emitting before you get a connection I bet it is being sent but lost, so the dev site has less connect latancy than the prod site and causes this
[20:35] Doidel__: might be, but then he should still notify me (in debug) that he got a message when I send one manually
[20:36] ljackson: Doidel__, unless it jacks up the connection try changing it to map_hero_movesocket.on('connect', function(){ ... your emits
[20:37] Doidel__: http://pastebin.com/ahTXBJyB
[20:37] Doidel__: ok I'll try

[20:44] k1ttty has joined the channel
[20:44] Doidel__: well, the website (which sends the emit) is not the same.

[20:44] ljackson: another domain on the same server or a diff server ?
[20:45] Doidel__: uhm ^^ how can I explain... Website a) is the same like b). a) uses the node.js server. b) (which is the same as a) ) uses the node.js server too. Both do the same. Both use the same node.js server.
[20:45] Doidel__: different server

[21:37] bingomanatee_: Anyone who wants to run server side code on Windows should be avoided. They are liable to make other worse decisions later on. 
[21:37] WarheadsSE: lzskiss, what about windows?
[21:38] WarheadsSE: bingomanatee_, careful with such borad statements
[21:38] bingomanatee_: Is anybody doing serious Ruby development on Windows? 
[21:38] bingomanatee_: Or PHP?
[21:38] WarheadsSE: ruby? wtf, crap.
[21:38] bingomanatee_: Or Python?
[21:38] WarheadsSE: if you are using python for web pages you need shot.
[21:38] WarheadsSE: >:)
[21:38] CoverSlide: well i know some people who use php on windows
[21:38] benvie: to be fair, node actualls performs well on Windows while those generally don't
[21:38] josh-k has joined the channel
[21:38] joshsmith: how do I hardcode the NODE_ENV variable locally?
[21:39] lzskiss: more compaines using win2008 R2 in intranet
[21:39] joshsmith: rather than passing it in each time I run the app
[21:39] CoverSlide: maybe a little java
[21:39] WarheadsSE: benvie, actually, I load tested a GNTP server on windows, with 50 clients sending messages, @ 1 second, offset intervals
[21:39] CoverSlide: but mostly on windows it's .net or nothing
[21:39] WarheadsSE: used about 5% cpu on a C2D 3.0 Win7
[21:40] bingomanatee_: Environment variables are environmental. You don't screw with them locally - but you can alter the code that relies on them. 
[21:40] benvie: yeah that's another thing. If you're using Windows in that capacity it's usually part and parcel with the .net buyin
[21:40] lzskiss: nice performance
[21:40] sriley: er why would you think that python isnt good for web pages...?
[21:40] WarheadsSE: Im just being an ass.
[21:40] bingomanatee_: "WarheadsSE: if you are using python for web pages you need shot." -- is this the guy who warned me against broad generalizations?
[21:41] WarheadsSE: I personally dont like python because it makes people lazy.
[21:41] bingomanatee_: Why yes it is! <mute>
[21:41] lzskiss: i dont wanna using win2008R2 but cutomers wants:)
[21:41] lzskiss: ergo i will be show the node.js can run fast on win:D
[21:41] lzskiss: if possible
[21:41] lzskiss: :D
[21:41] Dulak: bingomanatee_: What?  env vars are there precisely so you can control code execution without touching the code itself
[21:41] benvie: the first big thing for Windows was a way to make it work with IIS
[21:41] benvie: so that's the target generally
[21:41] chrisvwebdev has joined the channel
[21:41] joshsmith: I mean I call `NODE_ENV=development node app.js` on the command line
[21:41] WarheadsSE: lzskiss, yes it runs pretty well, the only concern atm is binary-link bits
[21:42] CoverSlide: noone's arguing windows can't handle node, it's just that with windows you give up a lot of the nice modularity of unix and get tons of overhead that has nothing to do with your project unless it runs on iis
[21:42] bingomanatee_: you can set env variables on the command line - that is basic bash. 
[21:42] joshsmith: I want to be able to just call `node app.js` and have the NODE_ENV automaticaly set to dev
[21:42] WarheadsSE: benvie, wasn't there a specific node & iss project?
[21:42] CoverSlide: process.env.NODE_ENV = 'development'
[21:42] GrizzLyCRO: WarheadsSE: any reason why you believe python is bad for web dev?
[21:42] benvie: yeah that's what I mean
[21:42] truedat101 has joined the channel
[21:42] CoverSlide: there is a node + iss project
[21:43] WarheadsSE: Again GrizzLyCRO I was just being an ass, to piss
[21:43] benvie: an IIS module for integrating with Node was the first Windows thing to come into existence
[21:43] CoverSlide: it works farily well too
[21:43] stantona has joined the channel
[21:43] tjholowaychuk: chuck NODE_ENV in a startup script
[21:43] sriley: joshsmith: why not put that in your bash profile then?
[21:43] tjholowaychuk: easy as pie
[21:43] GrizzLyCRO: ah lol, ok :)
[21:43] bingomanatee_: Also a significant amount of the modules that have been developed for node exploit unix so where you can ghet the root language running, you are kind of being short sighted in that you are limiting some of your ability to exploit the source code of the modules that are built on node. 
[21:43] joshsmith: sriley: ah, duh

[21:44] benvie: I will say that at this point most of the native modules that I've had to use were either already ported to windows or it was as simple as compiling them using the windows path
[21:44] sriley: not sure what you mean by lazy
[21:44] CoverSlide: i don't see how python makes people lazy
[21:44] lzskiss: batteries included:D
[21:44] bingomanatee_: DjanD'oh!
[21:44] benvie: and that'll get better when the route to compiling on windows is built out with gyp
[21:44] sriley: theres nothing wrong with using a framework to build a site

[21:49] WarheadsSE: lol
[21:49] WarheadsSE: sriley, I've written in all of them, and php can be good and bad, java can be clean yet robust, as for the kids.. yeah.....

[21:51] badlearner1: Hello, is starting out to build a photo/video sharing site on Javascript/node.js a good idea 'versus' Python/Django?
[21:52] WarheadsSE: badlearner1, if you plan on having the sharing site actually host the videos, don't host them from within node.js.
[21:52] WarheadsSE: It can, but was not meant for that.
[21:53] badlearner1: WarheadsSE: I can have the videos served from a separate Nginx or lighttpd server.
[21:54] truedat101 has joined the channel
[21:54] vervain: badlearner1... if your comparison is currently nodejs vs django... then I'm going to assume you are not super framework savey... so I'd point you at Django... been around longer... more tools... decent community.
[21:54] badlearner1: I am worried about performance
[21:54] xing has joined the channel
[21:54] sriley: personally im waiting for node to get some more robust frameworks before writing a site in node
[21:54] benvie: then you have come to the right place
[21:54] joshgillies has joined the channel
[21:54] badlearner1: I heard node.js is great versus Django and Rails
[21:54] CoverSlide: then you must write it in C
[21:55] badlearner1: C takes too much time in development
[21:55] benvie: or write it in C, that also
[21:55] vervain: Ya... not to mention... pre-optimization being the root of all evil. ;-)
[21:55] sriley: performance isnt a problem in almost any language, how you write the code however is
[21:55] WarheadsSE: screw C! best performance.... ASM!
[21:55] Dmitrijus: ;]]]]
[21:55] badlearner1: + if I have to learn javascript anyway for the front-end stuff... so...
[21:55] benvie: that's a large benefit
[21:55] Dmitrijus: WarheadsSE: actually, i would consider C faster than, well, ASM
[21:55] vervain: Screw ASM... build a proprietary processor... you could prototype in FPGA if you have to.
[21:55] vervain: :-)
[21:55] sriley: for example youtube is python
[21:56] WarheadsSE: Dmitrijus, that deponds on the optimizations, and proper use of compiler flags, as ... .. ...
[21:56] benvie: not everything is portable between front and back end, but the language knowledge is, and a lot of stuff works on both out of the box
[21:56] Dmitrijus: vervain: been there, done that :)
[21:56] WarheadsSE: hmm, yes, vervain : http://www.picocomputing.com/
[21:56] benvie: I'm a personal fan of LOLCODE for the hard tasks
[21:57] badlearner1: I know that YouTube and Picasa use Python, but not everywhere. They make have actually turned most/all of the intensive parts to Python
[21:57] skm has joined the channel
[21:57] badlearner1: sorry, to C++

[21:59] benvie: oh yeah that part
[22:00] badlearner1: So, plz tell me. If I am going to use a separate Nginx/lighttpd server for storing, encoding and serving videos, but javascript and node.js for everything else, including the fron-end for videos (player etc), would it be great?
[22:00] michaelhartau has joined the channel
[22:01] badlearner1: greater than Python or Ruby -- Django/Rails?
[22:01] vervain: There is no possible way we can answer that question.
[22:01] sriley: ruby probably, python... not really
[22:01] CoverSlide: node is good
[22:01] badlearner1: in terms of loading/serving time for pages, images and videos, number of simultaneous connections etc
[22:01] ChrisPartridge has joined the channel
[22:01] CoverSlide: but a lot of the performance has to do with how you handle the server

[22:09] CoverSlide: unless you don't count the spin up time

[22:10] WarheadsSE: You're going to have spinup no matter what, but that shouldnt be his concern ATM.
[22:11] WarheadsSE: hell, PHP on IIS with FastCGI & caching from Zend is pretty damn performant when done right.. which is reare.
[22:11] CoverSlide: and if the parsing is done slower in C than on the interpreted side, then that seems to be a problem with the C side

[23:00] JanLi: So, I cannto get require('plates') to work, anyone with the pacience to walk me through this? I know this is terribly beginner stuff, but keeps me from doing more interesting stuff...
[23:01] piscisaureus_: mmalecki: but I think we should use the macro magic patch for a while so we can compare non-tls vs tls performance
[23:01] piscisaureus_: mmalecki: I think that in the end I like to have all state in a struct though. But no hurry.
[23:02] mmalecki: piscisaureus_: not sure we're talking about the same thing, let me link you
[23:02] sente: ryanrolds_w: not yet, I had to a phone call 1 min after joining the chan
[23:02] JanLi: http://pastie.org/2941309
[23:02] sente: ryanrolds_w: i'll trouble shoot shortly, thanks for inquiring though
[23:02] mmalecki: piscisaureus_: https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/1983
[23:02] JanLi: I have the impression there is something wromg with my setup...
[23:03] piscisaureus_: mmalecki: aah heh - I was talking about the Thread Local Storage stuff that I was discussing with Ben today
[23:03] piscisaureus_: lol
[23:04] ryanrolds_w: sente: Cool, it really did look like you're missing the zlib headers (devel package).

[23:05] medice has joined the channel
[23:05] mmalecki: piscisaureus_: haha, no problem :). so, opinions on that?
[23:06] medice: bnoordhuis: sudo make install told me to bug you about it
[23:06] medice: i've done my duty
[23:06] bnoordhuis: medice: can you post the literal message?
[23:06] medice: `make install` is not implemented yet. Bug bnoordhuis about it in #node.js
[23:06] makeInstallBot: medice: `make install` is not supported on current node.js `master` due to build system refactor. Please use latest stable tag (v0.6.x).
[23:06] bnoordhuis: hurray for makeInstallBot :)
[23:06] mmalecki: :)

[23:08] piscisaureus_: we need a consistent api
[23:08] Xano_ has joined the channel
[23:08] CoverSlide: agreed
[23:09] mmalecki: piscisaureus_: ok, so tls.connect should accept host option?
[23:10] piscisaureus_: mmalecki: no it's more that tls.connect and net.connect should have be similar
[23:10] sente: ryanrolds_w: what exactly do i need to install for the devl package?
[23:10] piscisaureus_: s/have be/be/
[23:10] bnoordhuis: isaacs: [pid 31606] execve("./build-wrapper", ["./build-wrapper"], [/* 122 vars */]) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied) <- why does this happen when i do `npm install buffertools`
[23:10] bnoordhuis: isaacs: when i download and unpack the tarball, the build-wrapper script *is* executable
[23:10] Renegade001 has joined the channel
[23:11] bnoordhuis: this happens with the bundled npm btw
[23:11] isaacs: bnoordhuis: because of the bug i just fixed this morning :)
[23:11] mmalecki: piscisaureus_: ok, I'll look into it
[23:11] bnoordhuis: isaacs: oh, okay - never mind then :)
[23:11] isaacs: bnoordhuis: the latest in my tar-js branch on github works on linux.
[23:11] isaacs: just trying to work out why it's still borked in some ways on windows
[23:12] isaacs: i'm getting EACCES any time i try to stat a symlink
[23:12] johnnywengluu: tjholowaychuk: I still have problems with mocha throwing it's own errors instead of the original one
[23:12] piscisaureus_: mmalecki: if you can change net.connect to *also* take an options object it should be fine. Ryan should weigh in too, when he's back.
[23:12] joshkehn1 has joined the channel
[23:12] isaacs: this is reading the npm source from my Mac host in a VMware windows 7

[23:12] tjholowaychuk: johnnywengluu open issues
[23:12] isaacs: er, windows server something, rather
[23:13] isaacs: this used to work fine, but i changed the version of os x (lion) and also the version of vmware, so it's anyone's guess why it's not working
[23:13] isaacs: bnoordhuis: ^
[23:13] isaacs: ryah will be happier if i just make npm symlink-free anyway :)
[23:13] isaacs: he has a problem with them
[23:14] ryanrolds_w: sente: Try installing zlib1g-dev  with your preferred package manager

[23:14] bnoordhuis: isaacs: oh, from the rob pike school of philosophy?
[23:14] isaacs: bnoordhuis: i guess
[23:14] medice: currently switching from virtualbox to vmware becouse of symlink
[23:14] isaacs: bnoordhuis: i also have to add a flag to make it not do any proprietary tar extended headers.
[23:15] isaacs: since ancient garbage-tar can't handle them
[23:15] bnoordhuis: isaacs: you think you'll make it before thursday? i just told someone it'll be fixed :)
[23:15] brianseeders has joined the channel
[23:15] isaacs: hahah
[23:15] isaacs: yes.
[23:15] isaacs: it's almost there
[23:15] markwubben has joined the channel
[23:16] isaacs: also: dude, seriously? we *need* to have travis-ci building node.
[23:16] isaacs: it's just so trivial to set up
[23:16] mmalecki: I just wanted to propose it :)
[23:16] truedat101 has joined the channel
[23:16] isaacs: and it's already helped speed up this process with npm.
[23:16] mmalecki: josh-k: ^
[23:16] bnoordhuis: we have buildbots, only no one ever looks at them
[23:16] isaacs: yeah
[23:16] jldbasa has joined the channel
[23:16] bnoordhuis: but i'm all for CI
[23:16] isaacs: a build bot no one looks at is only slightly less useful than not having a build bot.
[23:16] CoverSlide: will it build on multiple architectures?
[23:16] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: travis can harass people in IRC
[23:16] josh-k: :)
[23:17] isaacs: mmalecki: so, the linux-only thing, it needs to have other operating systems.
[23:17] bnoordhuis: mmalecki: that's a useful feature... i think
[23:17] isaacs: the emails are fantastic.
[23:17] josh-k: CoverSlide: we are working towards that goal
[23:17] perezd: anyone here working with node_redis?
[23:17] mmalecki: isaacs: yeah, I think we'll have OS X soon (?)
[23:18] josh-k: isaacs: we do plan to support other archs, it will just take a little bit of time
[23:18] isaacs: josh-k: you all should try to work out some deal with joyent to use smartos and vm's
[23:18] isaacs: josh-k: other architectures are nice, but OS is another vector
[23:18] josh-k: i would love that
[23:18] josh-k: but they never got back to me
[23:18] josh-k: after two emails
[23:18] isaacs: we use jenkins internally.
[23:18] isaacs: i'm trying to sow the seeds of dissent.
[23:18] isaacs: maybe have an open source riot.
[23:19] isaacs: :)
[23:19] mmalecki: haha
[23:19] josh-k: haha
[23:19] isaacs: what's the behind-the-firewall story with travis?
[23:19] isaacs: can you install it on your own build machine pretty easily?
[23:19] quackquack: i dont think so, isaacs
[23:20] isaacs: we haev a lot of stuff that jenkins builds that isn't pubic
[23:20] isaacs: *public, either
[23:20] josh-k: isaacs: not yet sorry
[23:20] josh-k: isaacs: we are working towards that as well
[23:20] josh-k: including hosted ci for people who don't want to run travis
[23:20] josh-k: running travis requires lots of moving parts
[23:20] isaacs: interesting
[23:20] isaacs: yeah, i can see that
[23:20] perezd: "node_redis command queue state error. If you can reproduce this, please report it."
[23:20] isaacs: from the outside, it seems easy, though :)
[23:20] perezd: this sounds bad
[23:21] josh-k: everything will remain oss, but a hosted setup makes more sense
[23:21] josh-k: hahaha
[23:21] josh-k: well, its kinda easy, but not at the same time
[23:21] mmalecki: I mean, frontend is one repo and it's easy to set up
[23:21] mmalecki: building vms we use is also easy
[23:22] mmalecki: but connecting all the stuff not really
[23:22] josh-k: mmalecki: web, hub, workers, vms, rabbitmq, postgres, websockets
[23:22] mmalecki: yeah
[23:22] josh-k: and soon there will be another bit for listening to github pings
