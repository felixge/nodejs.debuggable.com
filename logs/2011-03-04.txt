[14:09] mikegerwitz: I'm unsure if it's changed since then. I haven't tried defineProperty in IE8 for getters/setters though..I'll give that a shot..
[14:09] mikegerwitz: partial support is more annoying to handle than no support
[14:09] winning: jetienne_: is it possible to define a getter or setter for foo[x]? 
[14:09] mikegerwitz: winning: foo[x].__defineGetter__() :)
[14:09] winning: so it does quux(x) for example?
[14:09] mikegerwitz: Oh.
[14:11] mikegerwitz: winning: nvm now I'm confused what you asked.

[14:14] dewey_: floby: no not sure, the normal command just give me an output so I thought that wasn't an error (it's the correct output)
[14:15] bradleymeck: winning, look into es harmony proxies, couple implementations are lying about
[14:15] marcello3d: keyword deathmatch is probably the most interesting bit
[14:15] floby: dewey_: maybe but in a standard shell both stdout and stderr get printed to the terminal. You can redirect the streams with > out.stdout 2> out.stderr
[14:15] marcello3d: oh and here is the raw data, if you don't want to wait through github's slow 60 calls/minute: https://gist.github.com/854171
[14:16] bradleymeck: mikegerwitz, seems it only works in IE8 strict + standard + non-compat mode
[14:16] dewey_: floby: you were right, it's the same output
[14:17] dewey_: floby: it's imagemagick, and the returned output isn't an error.. so that's imagemagick error right

[15:00] GriffenJBS: mscdex: thanks for your time
[15:00] mikegerwitz: stagas: On the lines of what floby mentioned (for which I completely agree) - I'd just implement more higher-level APIs. I know some I've spoken to have been hesitant to get into node simply because of how much effort it takes to get POST vars (in PHP it's just $_POST, in node you have to listen on 'data', etc)
[15:00] mikegerwitz: stagas: Don't get me wrong, I loev the flexibility when I want it :)
[15:00] mikegerwitz: love*
[15:01] eee_c has joined the channel
[15:01] mikegerwitz: more high-level*
[15:01] kristsk: write a wrapper around formidable or somthint then.
[15:02] floby: mikegerwitz: I use my lines module on EVERY SINGLE PROJECT. I mean, it's really intuitive to separate your data in a file by new lines
[15:02] mikegerwitz: floby: Yeah, I do a lot of shell scripting so line-by-line parsing is very common for me as well
[15:03] floby: I did once propose a patch to the core with this. but I had been told that it should go in userland
[15:03] mikegerwitz: kristsk: If node wants to take the approach of developing only a low-level library, that's fine. But I've noticed some convenient interfaces popping up that makes life easier. I do not want a simple projec tot have 500 dependencies
[15:04] seivan has joined the channel
[15:04] floby: mikegerwitz: most of the dependencies are transitive dependencies. Basically you explicitly install express,
[15:04] AAA_awright_ has joined the channel
[15:04] floby: mikegerwitz: and express takes care of its dependencies
[15:04] mikegerwitz: kristsk: Also, by introducing a dependency, you rely on the maintainer to actually keep it up to date. If they stop, and it no longer works with new versions of node, suddenly you're screwed.
[15:05] tanepiper: "Added server-side usage support for ExtJS4: hammerJS and nodeJS tested"
[15:05] tanepiper: from the release notes, woop!
[15:05] ajashton has joined the channel
[15:06] floby: mikegerwitz: true. But less true with a stable core project. This problem happens a lot with the current evolution of node. but it will get better with non-beta version I guess
[15:06] mikegerwitz: floby: Oh, yeah I'm aware :) I didn't mean it like that. I meant if I need a library to process HTTP requests, another for reading lines, another for sprintf (please add sprintf to the core), etc..that's a lot.

[15:06] malkomalko: still very young at 0.0.2, but have a looksee
[15:07] floby: wow, that was a massive disconnect
[15:07] floby: thinking of it, sprintf is pretty useful, and all the printf family. works great with localization
[15:08] mikegerwitz: floby: Yep, time will tell :) Once I see an author keeps up a module for years, and that it has a solid user base, then it's safe to say that even if they no longer support it, someone will fork it. Especially if I'm using node at work, my employer can't afford to have me maintain a library on top of the existing projects.

[15:32] pascalopitz: keys stuck :/
[15:32] mikegerwitz: ncb000gt: Well for something like sprintf, that's fine, yes. But take a web framework for example. Let's say you base your entire project off of it. Then it's no longer maintained. A new version of node breaks it. Suddenly you can't upgrade to new versions of node and you haven't the time to maintain both projects. If it's a personal project, that's an optioon. But you're at the mercy of your employer.
[15:32] ncb000gt: And, if it turns out that something isn't right or doesn't fit your project anymore, it shouldn't be hard to change out
[15:32] mikegerwitz: ncb000gt: depends on what you're using. If it can be abstracted reasonably well, then you are correct
[15:33] floby: mikegerwitz: that's just opensource issues

[15:33] ncb000gt: mikegerwitz: i understand your point but you could use the same argument about refactoring, "I can't do it because I'm too busy". If it's necessary, just do it

[15:35] brainproxy_ has joined the channel
[15:36] mikegerwitz: ncb000gt: Yeah refactoring or a fix is fine. But we can't foresee how much fixing a project may potentially need if it breraks. We're not familiar with the code. We are familiar with our code base.  So it is a gamble

[15:38] ncb000gt: I'm just arguing that you'll likely be making the same arguments in 6 months because you're still paranoid about depending on other peoples modules. Thus, you'll reinvent the wheel to avoid it and end up maintaining the same codebase.
[15:38] marcello3d: hmm, maybe that doesn't work
[15:38] mikegerwitz: ncb000gt: we've had to maintain 3rd party libraries in the past. Sometimes it works, yeah :) Other times it doesn't. So we use our best judgement.
[15:38] colinsullivan has joined the channel
[15:38] pascalopitz: no, OSX
[15:38] pascalopitz: above works
[15:38] ncb000gt: mikegerwitz: that's fine, i was under the impression that you were against all third party libs due to dependencies
[15:38] mikegerwitz: ncb000gt: which is why we're often forced to use modules - so we don't reinvent the wheel. Don't have time fo rthat. So I'm not saying we don't use modules. I'm just mentioning why it's nice to have some things int he core :)
[15:38] ncb000gt: which seemed a little off to me
[15:39] pascalopitz: you just can't use .
[15:39] ncb000gt: especially with tools like github or bitbucket
[15:39] ncb000gt: just fork the shiz :)
[15:39] marcello3d: possibly inside [], . means .
[15:39] mikegerwitz: ncb000gt: Oh, not at all. I'm a free software developer and highly supportive of whomever wants to spend the time to create the modules :)
[15:39] marcello3d: yea

[15:40] marcello3d: true: /[.]/.test(".")
[15:41] ncb000gt: mikegerwitz: yea, I go back and forth between whether things should be in core or not. I don't want probably even 5% if what is in npm to be in core. But I'm not exactly sure what should and is why I trust ryah and others to figure that out for me. :)
[15:42] mikegerwitz: ncb000gt: Oh I agree. My problem isn't necessarily that some things aren't in the core. It's more that the things in the core are sure to be maintained.
[15:42] mikegerwitz: ncb000gt: vs some modules may be created for fun, or to satisfy an itch, and go stale
[15:42] marcello3d: that's why you have to look at who wrote the module, why, and what their track record is
[15:42] mikegerwitz: ncb000gt: So as long as the module is maintained, that's fine by me. I don't want the core bloated.
[15:42] ncb000gt: mikegerwitz: right, but at the same time, we should put a bunch of things into core just because they'll be maintained
[15:42] floby: pascalopitz: works -> /config: \{(.|\n|\r)*\}/m.test(str);
[15:42] ncb000gt: mikegerwitz: yep
[15:43] marcello3d: floby: grody!
[15:43] mikegerwitz: ncb000gt: Yep, didn't mean to suggest that. Sorry, working and typing at the same time here. ;)
[15:43] pascalopitz: nicer
[15:43] floby: I really thought that new lines where included in .
[15:43] marcello3d: they should be with /m but maybe not?
[15:43] ncb000gt: mikegerwitz: all good, i likely misread it anyway, 4 hours of sleep... :)
[15:44] floby: haha
[15:44] metamind has joined the channel
[15:44] floby: you actually don't need the m flag on this one
[15:44] mikegerwitz: ncb000gt: I was in "employee" mode for part of the convo anyway, or playing devil's advocate
[15:44] marcello3d: this works: /[\s\S]*/m.exec("test\ntest")
[15:44] marcello3d: returns ["test\ntest"]
[15:44] floby: So I guess it's a bad implementation of /m
[15:44] marcello3d: no, you're right, . doesn't include newlines
[15:44] marcello3d: even with /m
[15:45] marcello3d: if you don't include m, my example returns ["test"]
[15:45] ncb000gt: mikegerwitz: sure. I have to deal with people that want to reinvent the wheel for everything so I get heated on that topic- hence my response.
[15:45] floby: so new lines are in \S ?
[15:45] marcello3d: I think they're in \s ?
[15:45] losing has joined the channel
[15:46] marcello3d: \S is everything that's not in \s

[15:46] bergie has joined the channel
[15:46] floby: marcello3d: yeah, that should cover it
[15:46] marcello3d: -> /[\s]*/m.exec("\n")
[15:46] floby: what is \s supposed to be ?
[15:47] dguttman has joined the channel
[15:47] marcello3d: whitespace?
[15:47] floby: oh
[15:47] mikegerwitz: ncb000gt: Yeah I don't encourage reinventing the wheel either unless there's a solid reason to. Better to pool the effort into a single project
[15:47] floby: silly me
[15:47] marcello3d: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp
[15:47] marcello3d: they're all listed there

[15:47] marcello3d: is what it matches :)
[15:47] dve has joined the channel
[15:48] marcello3d: floby: but which is faster? :)
[15:48] marcello3d: I would imagine [] is faster than |
[15:48] marcello3d: but hopefully it optimizes to the same thing in this case
[15:48] zzak: why is jade escaping my view :(
[15:49] floby: marcello3d: yeah think so. although, if it's for config, it must happen once in a program lifetime so, no big deal
[15:49] marcello3d: oh yea, they even suggest [\s\S] on that page: .	 (The decimal point) matches any single character except the newline characters: \n \r \u2028 or \u2029. ([\s\S] can be used to match any character including newlines.)

[17:19] jmar777: tjholowaychuk: would it be possible to convince you that dependencies should go in support (or a node_modules folder)? :)
[17:19] tjholowaychuk: bradleymeck: its not quite ideal for deployment yet
[17:19] tjholowaychuk: but getting there
[17:19] bradleymeck: for deploy yea
[17:19] tjholowaychuk: jmar777: no
[17:19] tjholowaychuk: jmar777: they are in ./support but for tests only
[17:20] jmar777: tjholowaychuk: ahh, so i should basically undo all the git submodule crap i did?
[17:20] tjholowaychuk: jmar777: you can do whatever you want lol its fine to use submods, but you have to know what the deps are
[17:20] tjholowaychuk: which is not hard
[17:20] tjholowaychuk: I just dont want to include them in the repo
[17:22] tracker1 has joined the channel
[17:22] jmar777: tjholowaychuk: fair enough. i guess for now i'll just add deps to a node_modules folder so that i don't have to tweak the connect require('...') statements
[17:22] tjholowaychuk: jmar777: you wouldnt have to, you would just have to unshift so that they are within require.paths
[17:22] tjholowaychuk: but ya node_modules will work

[19:08] asimismo: tjholowaychuk: Here's a twist. I also need to match the path without /tree to be handled by a different function. So, /:appSlug/:nodePath(*)/tree and /:appSlug/:nodePath(*) should be handled differently.

[19:13] jmar777: tjholowaychuk: k - i tried installing that one. i was just noticing that you use a method here: https://github.com/visionmedia/express/blob/1.0.8/lib/express/response.js#L203 that doesn't seem to be in that module
[19:13] jmar777: tjholowaychuk: also just noticed i'm looking at an express file...

[19:14] jmar777: tjholowaychuk: although it seems to use the same mime module
[19:14] tjholowaychuk: connect used to have its own mime mod
[19:14] tjholowaychuk: < 1.0
[19:15] jmar777: tjholowaychuk: is that mime.type() call defunct now then?
[19:15] tjholowaychuk: not if you are using 1.x
[19:15] tjholowaychuk: (express)
