[00:05] tjholowaychuk: haha yeah [] == false is a gooder
[00:05] devaholic: kickingvegas, goofy. dont use ==
[00:06] tjholowaychuk: i prefer == most of the time to be honest
[00:06] tjholowaychuk: just use either when it makes sense
[00:06] CoverSlide: !![] == true
[00:06] tjholowaychuk: typeof something === 'foo'
[00:06] tjholowaychuk: doesn't make sense
[00:06] tjholowaychuk: it'll give you a string :p
[00:07] devaholic: == if its a boolean
[00:07] kickingvegas: basically, I don't f**in know what the comparison behavior is unless I test it.
[00:07] kickingvegas: exhaustively.

[00:08] insin: are you looking to determine if the variables are the same type and have the same content, or if they refer to the same object?
[00:09] devaholic: reading the http://es5.github.com/#x9.12
[00:09] devaholic: makes me want to never use ==
[00:09] wiwillia:  devaholic just replied
[00:09] benvie: use strict equals both to ensure result, but also to convey intention
[00:09] benvie: to people reading your code

[00:14] tjholowaychuk: PFF
[00:14] tjholowaychuk: dont even
[00:14] tjholowaychuk: haha
[00:14] benvie: in theory it should always be but there's implementation cases where it's not
[00:14] benvie: but those aren't worth compromising over because it's edge stuff
[00:14] gkatsev: tjholowaychuk: haha, yeah, it's insignificant unless you are doing like a billion comparisons
[00:14] tjholowaychuk: if you're doing that much calc dont use js
[00:14] braoru has joined the channel
[00:14] gkatsev: probably
[00:15] timbl has joined the channel
[00:15] tjholowaychuk: browsers should all just use webkit, drop js, use luajit and call it a day
[00:15] benvie: and in many cases there's no difference because the engine can optimize == into what === is
[00:15] benvie: like the typeof one
[00:15] Tprice: how could i sandbox this (https://gist.github.com/1453944) to make it safer?
[00:16] benvie: but we're using javascript first and foremost because it'd expressive
[00:16] benvie: so use it to express things
[00:16] gkatsev: benvie: we jsperfed it the other day in ##javascript. It actually does make a difference. === is ALWAYS faster, even on v8. Though, almost insignificantly faster on v8. Both for best and worst case scenarios
[00:17] benvie: I thought there was some edge cases (not v8 definitely, I'd assume chakra/jscript) where == won out
[00:17] benvie: maybe that person who said it was full of shit, I didn't care to check
[00:17] benvie: because === will win always, or if it loses to some idiot implementation it'll be by a hair
[00:17] gkatsev: no, == will never win out to ===
[00:18] gkatsev: at worst, they will be the same time at best === will be much faster
[00:18] benvie: it can in an idiot implementation that adds optimizations to == and not ===, and do not test the maximum capacity for idiocy
[00:18] benvie: because you will always be wrong at how much idiot can exist
[00:18] OneOfOne: how to call nextTick in c++?
[00:18] benvie: but yeah you don't plan around that
[00:18] OneOfOne: need to make sure it runs on the main thread*
[00:18] benvie: use === and assume it's better
[00:19] benvie: if it's not firebomb the headquarters of the company making that js engine
[00:19] gkatsev: benvie: ok, I mean in spidermonkey and v8.
[00:20] benvie: anyway the diffeence is usually minimal if you know the output, so the larger value is in expressing intention
[00:20] benvie: I consider that very important

[00:21] gkatsev: yeah, it is

[00:22] benvie: I have an issue with IDL. The spec specifics for XMLHttpRequest that username and password are "string or null"
[00:22] kickingvegas: ACTION so I'm guessing JS comparisons is a hot/sore topic here - good to know I'm not alone in this...
[00:22] benvie: so what happens if the user doesn't pass anything
[00:22] benvie: if you follow that spec you get the string "undefined"
[00:22] benvie: intentions....
[00:22] tjholowaychuk: kickingvegas haha yeah it's messed. typeof is a fail, instanceof is a fail, == is a fail
[00:22] tjholowaychuk: if you can get passed some of those things js is pretty reasonable
[00:23] benvie: Object.prototype.toString actuall works but then doesn't provide a way to configure it usually for custom stuff

[00:33] kickingvegas: tjholowaychuk: understood

[00:35] benja-M- has left the channel
[00:36] benvie: although Rauschmayer claims it's never useful http://www.2ality.com/2011/12/strict-equality-exemptions.html

[00:37] Ownatik has joined the channel
[00:37] josh-k has joined the channel
[00:38] tjholowaychuk: it's super handy for == null
[00:38] tjholowaychuk: i dont love seeing foo === null || foo === undefined
[00:38] benvie: yeah that's the case that I'm thinking of when I do want to use it specifically
[00:39] benvie: I prefer minimizing verbosity up until the very edge of when it's detrimental because verbosity itself is a barrier to understanding code
[00:39] kickingvegas: IMHO having JS 'undefined' causes more trouble than it's worth.
[00:40] tjholowaychuk: benvie agreed
[00:40] tjholowaychuk: much prefer things likes req vs request blah blah
[00:40] tjholowaychuk: when it makes sense
[00:40] benvie: exactly. The minimal amount required to affirmatively express intention, and not break anything. even lines of code is important
[00:41] benvie: like putting brackets on separate lines is detrimental because the amount of code I can view at one time on my screen impacts my ability to digest it
[00:41] benvie: it's not a book, I don't read straight down and absorb. I need to see chunks of functionality and refer back and forth
[00:41] maxogden: http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/#isEqual etc
[00:41] maxogden: ftw
[00:42] tjholowaychuk: yeah haha it's not english
[00:42] tjholowaychuk: never should be
[00:42] tjholowaychuk: then you get applescript
[00:42] tjholowaychuk: YAYYY
[00:42] benvie: code is the userinterface for this stuff
[00:43] benvie: it needs to be optimized for humans
[00:43] tjholowaychuk: you can easily go overboard though, to the point where it just attracts people that have no clue what they're doing
[00:44] benvie: yeah it's a balance
[00:44] benvie: at every point you're trading comprehrension for one set of people and knowledge levels at the expense of another I think
[00:44] benvie: mostly
[00:44] benvie: although some things are just always good or bad
[00:44] hotroot: Yeah
[00:44] jocafa has joined the channel
[00:45] tjholowaychuk: it think it's good that things get harder the "deeper" you go, it keeps (mostly) stupid people out of C-land

[00:45] tjholowaychuk: do i want an operating system written by myself, no
[00:45] benvie: yeah, or at least people with minds aligned to do that kind of thing
[00:45] tjholowaychuk: yeah totally
[00:46] benvie: it's interesting how, for example, language implementers often don't understand what developers in that language need to meet their needs in meeting end user needs. Obviously they're very intelligent to be doing that task
[00:46] benvie: but their brain doesn't do this other thing
[00:46] benvie: everyone has their place
[00:46] tjholowaychuk: i think they just get too disconnected
[00:46] benvie: yeah
[00:46] tjholowaychuk: just like you start off as a web dev then you migrate to building tools
[00:47] tjholowaychuk: and eventually forget what web devs need

[00:58] benvie: for what purpose
[00:59] benvie: xml parsers serve most but not all
[00:59] tbranyen: yeah xml won't serve very well if its malformed xml but valid html
[00:59] benvie: sax

[00:59] chrisvwebdev has joined the channel
[00:59] benvie: dom.js has a complete html parser but it's not set up as a node module
[00:59] tbranyen: oh really? I was under the impression it was
[01:00] tbranyen: where else would you use it/
[01:00] tbranyen: ?
[01:00] hipsters_: purpose is to grab a webpage and strip some relevant data from it
[01:00] hipsters_: XHTML 1.0 page
[01:00] benvie: well it's developed by mozilla for spidermonkey. I know this because I spent the last week and a half building a dynamic loader for it to load in Node without building it =D
[01:01] benvie: the html parser could be separated easily enough though
[01:01] benvie: easier than the rest
[01:01] hipsters_: looking into it now, thanks
[01:01] tbranyen: hipsters_: if its valid xhtml any xml parser *should* work

[02:24] buu: context: I was asking about situations where Iw ouldn't want to use for x in y
[02:24] kickingvegas: buu: you can only do for (x in foo()) if foo() returns a dictionary
[02:25] kickingvegas: buu: if foo() returns an array then you can map that to a dictionary and get what you want
[02:26] buu: Oh
[02:26] marcello3d: foo().forEach(function(item[, index]) { ... }) 
[02:26] buu: Using it on the array gave me 0,1,2,3,etc in my iter variable.

[02:50] hotroot: rohitcolinrao: Hey
[02:50] rohitcolinrao: okie dokee… does anyone know a good next step after node beginner.org?
[02:51] hotroot: How well do you know javascript?
[02:51] rohitcolinrao: pretty well, from a browser perspective… sr front end guy… written a couple jquery plugins for work level
[02:52] hotroot: Then read the API
[02:52] rohitcolinrao: cool
[02:52] hotroot: And examples, examples are good
[02:52] rohitcolinrao: that's good actually, after doing the demo today, i was wondering what other commands etc were available to use
[02:52] rohitcolinrao: thanks
[02:52] hotroot: But essentially the API is the goto book if you think about it. It's more or less a library you have access to from regular JS

[02:54] doki_pen: rohitcolinrao: learn npm

[02:54] rohitcolinrao: i think i'm a little ways from writing modules just yet, but that's the goal
[02:55] dshaw_ has joined the channel
[02:55] doki_pen: I like looking at isaacs and substacks code for examples
[02:55] hotroot: The code may not be amazing, but here's my basic telnet chat server I wrote if you need an example of a working node app. Learning SQL right now to implement a database login system instead of in-RAM
[02:55] hotroot: http://pastebin.com/LfiGuKH9
[02:56] rohitcolinrao: what db are you planning on using with it?
[02:56] hotroot: sqlite
[02:56] doki_pen: I'm loving redis if you don't need to scale crazy
[02:57] hotroot: Not the best idea for a server, but if the project ever needs to be multi-system / cloud, I'll switch to something better
[02:57] hotroot: Just learning SQL right now, so I figure sqlite is the best starting point, as it's single file
[02:57] rohitcolinrao: i haven't gotten into the dbs yet, will need to soon, but a buddy mentioned that json based dbs are gaining steam vs traditions rdbms types?
[02:57] rohitcolinrao: sure
[02:57] doki_pen: check out redis, I'm in love
[02:57] hotroot: I don't know much about them, sorry.
[02:57] rohitcolinrao: i will
[02:58] doki_pen: couchdb seems to be popular, I haven't used it much
[02:58] doki_pen: I use cassandra to scale
[02:58] rohitcolinrao: yeah, been hearing about nosql and mongo myself
[02:58] doki_pen: it's a lot to learn though
[02:58] doki_pen: redis, you can pick up in a couple of days
[02:58] rohitcolinrao: redis sounds familiar but haven't checked… 
[02:58] rohitcolinrao: cool
[02:58] doki_pen: and it's super useful
[02:58] hotroot: This tut is great for learning SQL, been using it myself
[02:58] hotroot: http://www.sql-tutorial.net
[02:59] doki_pen: sqlite is great for small apps where relational adds value

[02:59] rohitcolinrao: is there a master list of all node modules so far anywhere?
[03:00] doki_pen: npm search?
[03:00] rohitcolinrao: haven't checked out the npm site yet, i'll check it out
[03:00] doki_pen: npm is package manager
[03:00] rohitcolinrao: right
[03:01] hotroot: I know sqlite isn't the right option for a telnet server, even a small one, but w/e. Ease of use beats performance atm
[03:01] rohitcolinrao: installed a couple with it so far
[03:01] rohitcolinrao: just haven't checked it out in detail
[03:01] doki_pen: hotroot: that would be perfect for redis
[03:01] rohitcolinrao: yeah if ur just starting out with sql sqlite is a fine beginning
[03:01] hotroot: I'll check redis later, just trying to learn SQL atm
[03:01] doki_pen: gotcha
[03:02] hotroot: Not sure how to load the DB into RAM though / write changes
[03:02] rohitcolinrao: ah yes, redis is a nosql db like the ones i've been hearing about
[03:03] doki_pen: hotroot: Last time I used sqlite, it did a DB lock on write
[03:03] doki_pen: that was a couple of years ago
[03:03] doki_pen: so every write would block all other calls until it was on disk
[03:03] rohitcolinrao: i'm not sure how it works from node, but you're gonna need to have a sql driver installed/configured so node can access it
[03:03] hotroot: Yeah, but I want to load into ram
[03:03] hotroot: I already have the driver installed
[03:03] rohitcolinrao: gotcha
[03:04] hotroot: sqlite3 in npm
[03:04] rohitcolinrao: ah nice
[03:04] doki_pen: hotroot: what happens if you process dies?
[03:04] rohitcolinrao: what part of the db are you trying to load into ram?  like a result set?
[03:04] hotroot: Good point, but isn't it slow opening a file every time I need to write?
[03:04] hotroot: Oh, my bad, it keeps the file open huh
[03:05] doki_pen: you could create a mmap file for the db
[03:05] hotroot: Derp
[03:05] hotroot: Nevermind, sa'll good
[03:05] doki_pen: http://www.sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html
[03:06] doki_pen: of course, you lose persistance in that case

[03:22] kickingvegas: hotroot: depends on what you're looking to do but my understanding  about any module in Node.js is how well does it support async i/o. IMHO it's the _only_ reason to use it to offset the cost of increase complexity in managing callback logic
[03:23] hotroot: Pretty sure sqlite3 does async
[03:23] hotroot: You can force it to do serialized though so stuff doesn't fuck up

[04:04] hotroot: RegEx chapter, wish me luck
[04:04] Leemp: joshsmith: So,Hands-on will help explain non-blocking IO? (Eg, if i need to load a file to render a template to give to a client.. how the hell i do that in a non-blocking system)
[04:06] hotroot: Callbacks?
[04:06] hij1nx has joined the channel
[04:06] hotroot: fopen("file.file", function(file) {client.send(file);});
[04:07] Leemp: hotroot: Well for example.. i just don't understand how something can be non-blocking, but preform a blocking action..? Eg, if you need to load a file from the server, to return a proper response to the client. That to me, shouts blocking.. right? So if you don't block, the client gets an incomplete response.. no?
[04:08] hotroot: How is that blocking?
[04:08] hotroot: Look how AJAX works
[04:08] hotroot: You send a request, and then in the background AJAX waits for a reply
[04:08] maxogden: Leemp: the nonblocking part just means that node can go and handle other requests while its waiting for your file to read
[04:08] Leemp: hotroot: Yes but ajax is not what i'm asking
[04:09] hotroot: ^^^
[04:09] marcello3d: Leemp: the client gets no response until the server responds
[04:09] Leemp: maxogden: So how do i go about loading a file? Is, node.fs.readFile() (for example) non-blocking by design, and as such i should stay away from it and use hotroot's example of fopen()?
[04:10] Leemp: (Keep in mind i am not arguing, i am just trying to understand)
[04:10] marcello3d: Leemp: the client just waits there until you send something back, close the connection, or the browser decides to time it out 
[04:10] maxogden: Leemp: you get to call close on the http server response whenever you want
[04:10] hotroot: Err, I don't think fopen is a real command in node
[04:10] maxogden: Leemp: and all node streams have an 'end' event
[04:10] hotroot: I was just giving pseudocode and some Python leaked through
[04:10] Leemp: hotroot: Righto
[04:11] Leemp: Huh, well, i guess i'll just have to read more to understand what i am missing. All i know, is when i try to read a file, my code path jumps right past the function, due to the callback nature. 
[04:12] Leemp: There must be a general design concept that i am breaking
[04:12] maxogden: Leemp: if you keep reading through examples you'll understand it eventually. evented programming is one of those things you have to wrap your head around
[04:12] Leemp: maxogden: Yea
[04:12] maxogden: Leemp: if you dont understand how anonymous functions work it can be confusing too
[04:12] mikeal has joined the channel
[04:13] Leemp: maxogden: So far though, annoyingly so, no example i've seen yet touch what i am confused on. They're either hello world (with no commonly blocking actions taking place), or rather complicated setups and i'm rather lost

[04:14] Leemp: maxogden: Don't believe so
[04:16] hotroot: I think setInterval is a good example for explaining async
[04:16] marcello3d: Leemp: async just means that the function you pass in will be called at a later point in time, and your code continues on

[04:17] marcello3d: Leemp: so in a file read case, it'll go off and read the file independently, continue the remainder of your code, and then once the file is read, it'll call your function with the data

[05:30] esad: am I doing something wrong here?
[05:30] prettyrobots has joined the channel
[05:31] polotek: esad: that warning was added to catch the case where you are adding lots of listeners for one event
[05:31] polotek: it's usually not intended because one listener or maybe a couple is usually enough
[05:32] polotek: why would multiple requests be waiting on the same db call anyway?
[05:32] esad: let's say I have no idea in which order they will come back
[05:32] esad: and I want to lazy-initialize the database
[05:33] polotek: esad: what does lazy initializing the db buy you?
[05:33] polotek: most people initialize the db before starting their server
[05:33] esad: might be a good point
[05:33] polotek: either way, still no need to have a listener for each request
[05:34] polotek: the db init is a one time thing
[05:34] polotek: just set a flag
[05:34] polotek: keep all the callbacks in an array
[05:34] polotek: when the db init fires then loop through them and call them
[05:34] polotek: this is effectively the same as what eventemitter would do
[05:34] polotek: but it's more explicit
[05:34] polotek: and it's intended that way because eventemitter is very hot code

[05:36] polotek: and the warning often leads you to rethink your design IMO
[05:37] der|: When using the cluster module, do all worker processes have access to the same globals, or do they have their own set of globals ?
[05:37] esad: yes, this is why I asked :)
[05:37] esad: but I think it might be ok like this
[05:37] esad: it's a bot with lot of plugins. Some of them need persistence and the core provides set/get API for plugins.
[05:37] esad: every plugin has it's own datafile where it stores persisted data
[05:37] esad: so I wanted to avoid creating db files for plugins that will never call set/get

[06:49] polotek: Mustansir: the core version of cluster doesnt exist in 0.4.x
[06:49] polotek: you are seeing something else there
[06:50] Mustansir: I'm installing the cluster package using npm
[06:50] polotek: not the same
[06:50] WRAz: and figured it out
[06:51] polotek: you are basically using 2 different modules on 0.4.x and 0.6.x
[06:51] polotek: on 0.4 it will use the npm module
[06:51] Mustansir: ahhh
[06:51] Mustansir: they changed it on me
[06:51] polotek: on 0.6 it will find the core module first
[06:51] Mustansir: makes sense.
[06:51] Mustansir: and the api is different
[06:52] Mustansir: it's c style forking

[07:03] Mustansir: polotek: Got it. I assumed they pulled the module in to core based on the name. Incorrect assumption on my part.

[12:52] adrianF: does somebody know if a local hook.io installation on linux (something have to be compiled) runs on a mac or should i have to install it global on both devices?
[12:54] mansoor: adrianF: it seems like its one of its dependencies that had to be compiled
[12:54] adrianF: yes its "weak"
[12:54] adrianF: for tcp
[12:55] andrewfff has joined the channel
[12:55] TheJH has joined the channel
[12:56] mansoor: adrianF: hook.io will run anywhere, so long as its dependencies are meet. Compile, or no compile you'll need the rest of the dependencies on your mac. Are you having trouble compiling it on a mac?
[12:58] adrianF: we are using git and there are linux and macs involved and we want to install hook.io locally
[12:58] adrianF: in the projectfolder
[12:59] adrianF: i only see that there is something that have to be compiled and i asked myself if it runs on a mac without problems
[13:01] weezle has joined the channel
[13:01] TheJH: adrianF, put node_modules in .gitignore

[16:05] pepe____: how can i install the missing dependencies on my npm packages?, i did npm install, however the node_modules did not install the dependencies, what am i doing wrong?
[16:06] TheJH: adrianF, one hook that is the socket.io server. then, make one hook per logical unit. like, one hook for chat, one for sending users the time or stuff like that
[16:06] TheJH: pepe____, does the package.json contain the needed dependencies?
[16:06] adrianF: TheJH, but then i need the (user-) socket object in that hooks ?
[16:07] TheJH: adrianF, why?
[16:07] thalll has joined the channel
[16:07] pepe____: TheJH: yes, it is express and require connect
[16:07] TheJH: adrianF, take incoming messages and re-emit them into the hookio stuff
[16:07] adrianF: ok
[16:08] TheJH: pepe____, so, is there some kind of error? what exactly doesn't get installed?
[16:08] adrianF: but how can the chat-hook respons to the user, if the socket for that user is not available?
[16:08] adrianF: emit the response from the chat-hook back to the socket-hook ant then back to the user?
[16:08] TheJH: adrianF, I think socket.io sockets have IDs. so just send the message together with the ID.
[16:09] TheJH: adrianF, yes

[16:14] TheJH: pepe____, yes, please

[16:20] TheJH: pepe____, that npm version is relatively old, also update that
[16:20] Hurrndurrn: is there no way to set a timeout in seconds in the DNS api?

[17:01] JmZ: hey
[17:03] JmZ: i have a slight logic issue. my app parses some document, queues items from this document to be processed (using async module's queue). Processing an item involves inserting it into a db, so i use mongodb-native
[17:03] JmZ: now the problem is, the application will never exit until you close the db connection
[17:04] JmZ: but how can i possibly know when everything has finished and it is safe to close? The drain event on the queue is useless since callbacks within queue items may still be running
[17:04] JmZ: and that event is called multiple times it seems

[18:44] jinside has left the channel
[18:45] rabidmachine9: as it turns out there are at least 2 node_module foldes in my system
[18:45] Leemp: Namely, the fact that i am storing output in scope variables, rather than passing data back into the exec_complete() function.. but, storing data needs to happen in some type of scope (outside of exec_complete()) i believe, right? Without it, we'd have no idea when both execs are complete.

[20:11] mmalecki: knifed: dunno man, nodejitsu team? I never selected myself any mentor
[20:11] knifed: ok mmalecki 
[20:11] TheJH: knifed, people usually don't really have a mentor - more like "ask in IRC" or so
[20:12] knifed: yes sure TheJH 
[20:13] TheJH: knifed, I'd guess there's nobody who has a real superset of the knowledge of anyone who knows relatively much about a topic. maybe more, but not a superset
[20:13] Lingerance: I have two mentors, the Internet and myself.
[20:13] TheJH: knifed, and you need a superset in order to be a mentor, I'd say
[20:13] TheJH: Lingerance, you have a superset of your own knowledge? :D

[20:21] knifed: why coparing commucicating with self? TheJH 
[20:21] knifed: comparing*
[20:22] TheJH: knifed, he said his knowledge is a superset of his knowledge
[20:23] TheJH: knifed, therefore, given an infinite amount of self-communication, his knowledge becomes infinite
[20:23] mmalecki: TheJH: maximum call stack size is limited.
[20:24] moogoo: sounds like one of those perpetual montion machines
[20:24] knifed: rite mmalecki my stack just overflowed
[20:24] TheJH: mmalecki, it uses IO anyway, which causes the stack to flatten
[20:24] doubletap: i highly doubt this, but is there anything special about setInterval in node.js? I can't seem to get even a console output using setInterval.
[20:25] moogoo: the brain was async before it was cool
[20:25] Wizek has joined the channel
[20:25] TheJH: doubletap, somewhat - it returns an object, not a number, and its first argument must be a function, not a string or so
[20:26] moogoo: it must be?
[20:26] TheJH: doubletap, e.g. nodes setInterval can't be misused as eval
[20:26] moogoo: hmm seems so
[20:26] doubletap: very nice TheJH
[20:26] doubletap: trying again...
[20:26] zmbmartin has joined the channel
[20:26] TheJH: doubletap, did you make sure to pass a time in milliseconds as second argument?

[20:28] Hurrndurrn: is there no way to set a timeout in seconds in the DNS api?

[21:04] blueadept: they sould pick up coffeescript then

[21:04] chjj: disgusting ^

[21:05] blueadept: chjj: oh come on
[21:05] chjj: =/
[21:05] blueadept: life without braces is so good
[21:05] moogoo: coffeescript kinda sucks for srs stuff cause of its scope issues
[21:05] chjj: if youre into being trendy
[21:05] chjj: i for one like curly braces
[21:05] blueadept: moogoo: i dont think there's any scope issues
[21:06] moogoo: there are
[21:06] blueadept: if anything scope is improved by wrapping everything in anon functions
[21:06] blueadept: forces you to be more structured in the way you write
[21:06] moogoo: CS doesnt fully support lexical scoping
[21:06] blueadept: well, its not the silver bullet by any means
[21:06] chjj: blueadept: it was made for people who dont understand and are afraid of `var`

[21:08] adambeynon has joined the channel
[21:08] moogoo: there's no way arround it
[21:08] moogoo: since there's no var statement
[21:08] Sorella: moogoo, you can inline var declarations, but it's ugly. Also, you can use lexical-let blocks.
[21:08] blueadept: i'm not making the case that it everyone should use CS, i'm just saying for a lot of the run of the mill js i'm doing, cs is a great tool
[21:09] blueadept: use case, use case, etc.
[21:09] moogoo: inline var declarations?
[21:09] Sorella: let = (fn) -> fn(); (let (x = 1, y = 2) -> x + y)
[21:09] Sorella: moogoo, you can inline javascript code by surrounding it in backticks
[21:09] moogoo: point is you cant shadow variables in CS and if you try you are just writing to the outer variable
[21:09] moogoo: oh
[21:09] moogoo: like inline asm
[21:10] Sorella: yeah, ugly as fuck though
[21:10] doubletap has left the channel
[21:10] moogoo: cocco has a decent solution

[21:11] Sorella: Coco is too perl-ish though.
[21:11] blueadept: well yeah, i realize if i want to start doing more machine leaening, i'm going to have to pick up either haskell or ocaml
[21:11] moogoo: thats a good thing see
[21:11] Sorella: not that CS isn't bloated, but Coco takes it to a whole new level

[21:19] Sorella: Well, GWT and the Closure library are terrible, yes.
[21:19] moogoo: thats what google did
[21:19] Sorella: Dart is surprisingly okay though.
[21:20] Sorella: except it lacks like... everything
[21:20] rwaldron has joined the channel
[21:21] moogoo: whats the point of Dart
[21:21] moogoo: exactly
[21:21] Sorella: performance, shared code between client and server, structured programming for the web (whatever that means).
[21:22] Sorella: But they're still in the 0.1 release :3
[21:22] moogoo: shared code between client & server == way overrated
[21:22] tkaemming has joined the channel
[21:23] Andeye: moogoo: why? because they have different tasks?
[21:23] moogoo: well sure
[21:24] Sorella: moogoo, perhaps. Some of the stuff can be shared though, so it limits the amount of duplicated code.
[21:24] moogoo: mostly just the same language server and client is overrated
[21:24] moogoo: as long as server and client side are seperate entities...
[21:24] moogoo: is Dart supposed to run somewhat like GWT
[21:25] Sorella: I'm not familiar with GWT.
[21:25] koo3 has joined the channel
[21:25] moogoo: where you only write server side and the compiler creates any client side scripts it needs
[21:25] Sorella: But Dart is just JS + Smalltalk with single inheritance and Java-ish syntax.
[21:25] Sorella: well, perhaps JS + Strongtalk
[21:26] moogoo: +smalltalk eh
[21:26] Sorella: moogoo, and no. It's just a general programming language. It doesn't have any UI libraries yet afaik.
[21:26] moogoo: Dart is intended to solve JavaScript's problems (which, according to a leaked memo, cannot be solved by evolving the language) while offering better performance, the ability "to be more easily tooled for large-scale projects" and better security features.
[21:26] Sorella: moogoo, well classes are not first-class, but everything seems to be around message passing. Including operator application.
[21:26] moogoo: wikipedia is so non-biased
[21:27] moogoo: what are these problems that cannot be solved
[21:27] Sorella: the current semantic warts of the language (e.g.: constructor functions), since that would break backwards compatibility.
[21:28] Sorella: ES.next is just going to pile features on top of the current ones in an attempt to make some things "easier" and make up for the flaws of the past. But well, the flaws will still be there.
[21:28] moogoo: not sure how that's an unsolveable problem when constructor functions can just be ingored
[21:29] HT has joined the channel
[21:29] jlaire has joined the channel

[21:37] jimmysparkle has joined the channel
[21:38] Sorella: Seth Ladd apparently would want people to use GWT :3
[21:40] Sorella: Oh, sure you *will* have complexity in any decent programming language. The job of the PL designer is to careful design it so that these complexities are nicely hidden in easily extensible primitive combinators. JS didn't had the time to be designed.

[21:43] moogoo: didnt have time to be designed...but is subject to intense research and development beyond most other languages
[21:43] moogoo: all Dart seems to claim to do is be easier to implament for compiler writers
[21:44] isaacs has joined the channel
[21:44] moogoo: yay?
[21:44] moogoo: google seems to think we are all asm hackers running 386's

[21:45] mmalecki: mikeal: thanks for writing it up
[21:45] Sorella: New languages have more possibilities and stuff.
[21:46] Sorella: unless you compile to JS, in which case you're stuck with the same problems.
[21:46] tbranyen: new languages are also really hard to gain widespread adoption

[21:48] moogoo: but without the limits of JS
[21:48] Sorella: tbranyen, yes. I think I agree with Steve Yegge's post on the features that make a successful language. Though JS has an unfair advantage of being the only game in town.
[21:48] moogoo: not that there are really any if you are willing to implament a VM
[21:49] Sorella: well, they're working on a WebKit branch to support multiple VMs, iirc.
[21:50] Sorella: which was met with utmost hate from the Apple fags :3
[21:50] moogoo: hm?
[21:50] moogoo: are apple fags still angry that google stole webkit
[21:51] Sorella: Something about "if WebKit ever gets this, iOS will lose all its advantages -- no one will want to write native iOS apps, -- so we're going to oppose this shit"

[22:49] blueadept: polotek: i think
[22:49] blueadept: once you ajax load a section of the page the url stays the same
[22:49] blueadept: so i can't really use the url as a base point to use as a variable to increment the page value to make the next ajax section load correctly
[22:50] polotek: oh I see. Why not just keep a reference to the current page in javascript. In whatever code is doing pagination
[22:51] blueadept: well for instance, that'll work for page 1
[22:51] blueadept: but if a user clicks on let's say page 4, how do i know on the client side they're on page 4 if not for the url?
[22:52] polotek: when they click on page 4 you save 4 into a currentPage variable that you are maintaining
[22:52] gsmcwhirter: blueadept: you could use hash fragments (possibly with something, like sammy or any number of the other alternatives)
[22:52] polotek: I'm sure I'm missing something about what you're saying
[22:52] mansoor has joined the channel
[22:52] polotek: are you using some pagination library that you don't have a lot of control over?
[22:52] blueadept: i'm sort of doing it myself i guess you could say

[22:55] blueadept: yeah, i'm just seeing his solution, i'm not going to be using the same libs or anything

[22:56] polotek: blueadept: gist some code that illustrates what you're having trouble with
[22:56] guybrush: ah lol nvm regarding canvas on 0.6.x - it runs just fine

[22:59] polotek: blueadept: this is pretty straight forward, what's the proble?
[23:00] blueadept: this works only if they're on page 1
[23:00] blueadept: if they start on page 4, then i have an issue

[23:00] mmalecki: SubStack: btw, for this continuous deployment stuff, check out https://github.com/dominictarr/balancer
[23:01] SubStack: mmalecki: I just saw that!
[23:01] polotek: blueadept: ah, you need to initialize the LocationsPager with the initial page number
[23:01] polotek: is that it?
[23:02] blueadept: hm
[23:02] blueadept: let me try that
[23:02] mmalecki: SubStack: ah, lol. it's an awesome project. you should talk to Dominic when he shows up
[23:02] blueadept: i have it set to 1 by default, but maybe i should set it to page 1 if there is no url, and if there is a url, then initalize it with that variable
[23:02] mmalecki: SubStack: or ping him on twitters or whatever
[23:03] polotek: blueadept: if you want your urls to support deep linking to pages then you'll have to do this
[23:03] polotek: but I guess the other thing is your Class doesn't support liking to arbitrary pages
[23:03] polotek: only forward 1 page or backward 1 page
[23:03] blueadept: right
[23:03] polotek: I guess that's your actual problem
[23:03] diminoten has joined the channel
[23:04] blueadept: oh ok, so how do i set it up to support abritary pages? just put logic into the constructor?
[23:04] polotek: no, you need a method "render_page(pageNum)" or something like that
[23:04] polotek: it sets @page = pageNum and then does the normal json call
[23:04] blueadept: ok, let me try something
[23:05] polotek: you'll need to do some work to make sure pageNum is valid
[23:05] blueadept: lol
[23:05] blueadept: i just got it working
[23:05] polotek: and then you'll set up your pagination links to pass in the appropriate page number
[23:05] blueadept: dude you are a savior
[23:05] blueadept: i was tryingn to work this for 2 hours, and you just were like "change up the constructer dude" 
[23:06] blueadept: damn i hate it when i really try to work some code, and i just over think it too much
[23:06] blueadept: i was tyring to work with cookies and crap for like an hour
[23:06] blueadept: i wrote all these cookie creation, read functions
[23:06] blueadept: haha
[23:06] blueadept: all i needed was like 2 lines of a url reader constructor function
[23:07] polotek: simple is always better than clever
[23:07] polotek: and less code is always better than more
[23:07] blueadept: can't wait to go to the pub tonight
[23:07] polotek: those 2 things are the only things that allow me to be a professional programmer with the likes of people much smarter than me
[23:08] maxogden: polotek: those two statements contradict eachother in lots of situations
[23:08] blueadept: polotek: very cool
[23:08] polotek: maxogden: they aren't edicts. they should guide thinking

[23:36] a|i: does node.js support live video streaming?
[23:36] blueadept: yes
[23:37] blueadept: you can do sockets with node
[23:37] a|i: blueadept: are there any apps doing this?
[23:37] blueadept: but you'd have to create your own wage of managing that type of data
[23:37] a|i: something less theoretical?
[23:37] blueadept: i've seen a few
[23:37] a|i: any links?
[23:37] blueadept: i dont know of any production apps
[23:37] a|i: any toy apps?
[23:37] blueadept: actually i dont have any links on hand, just stuff i saw on HN
[23:38] blueadept: try a a google search for: :site news.ycombinator node.js streaming
[23:38] a|i: thanks.
[23:38] blueadept: http://substack.net/posts/cb328d/Binary-Stream-Parsing-in-Node-js
[23:39] blueadept: first you have to capture the data
[23:40] blueadept: right now i dont think html5 can do that
[23:40] jbrokc has joined the channel
[23:40] blueadept: but the spec is supposed to be going in some time soon
[23:40] a|i: that has to be done with flash.
[23:40] blueadept: yeah
[23:40] blueadept: then once you have that stream in memory, you can stream it out with node.js
[23:40] a|i: I wonder why no one does it.
[23:41] caolanm has joined the channel
[23:41] blueadept: it's coming
[23:41] a|i: flash media server is basically nothing but an old version of actionscript (which is a kind of javascript) and c++ code.
[23:41] a|i: that's very similar to node.
[23:42] a|i: I cannot find any working demos on this.
[23:44] eeemsi: did someone build a very simple blog using nodejs?
