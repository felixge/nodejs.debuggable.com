[00:08] poincare101: Hi everyone. I was looking through the Node Code, and I noticed that there was this bit going on with this.headers = this.headers || {}
[00:08] poincare101: what would that do? Would that set this.headers to {} if its this.headers isn't true?
[00:09] maxogden: s/this.headers isn't true/this.headers isn't truthy/
[00:09] aioue has joined the channel
[00:10] tilgovi has joined the channel
[00:11] killing-joke: poincare101, i use that idiom in other languages to mean "if there are pre-existing 'headers', use those. if 'headers' is nil, then we need to create some, so initialize 'headers' with this empty (whatever)"
[00:12] killing-joke: poincare101, but be warned, i just started learning JS this weekend.
[00:12] codygray has joined the channel
[00:13] avih has joined the channel
[00:13] killing-joke: mostly, that statement at or near the top makes the code safer for re-entry. if i call the func again, i preserve my earlier headers. on the first pass through the code, i initialize and populate 'headers'
[00:13] jesusabdullah: I can explain
[00:13] killing-joke: yes, please
[00:13] jesusabdullah: js or falls through
[00:13] jesusabdullah: so, if this.headers exists it's truthy
[00:13] mrryanjohnston has joined the channel
[00:13] bwinton has joined the channel
[00:14] jesusabdullah: and the result of this.headers || {} is this.headers
[00:14] jesusabdullah: but, if this.headers is falsey, it returns the second one
[00:14] jesusabdullah: or, {}
[00:14] jesusabdullah: so the reason it does that is to make sure this.headers is defined so that you can do something like,
[00:14] jesusabdullah: if (this.headers.foobar) { ... }
[00:14] jesusabdullah: if you try to access (undefined).foobar it'll explode on you
[00:15] jesusabdullah: hence the need to set this.headers to {} if necessary
[00:15] killing-joke: good explanation
[00:15] jesusabdullah: so, like you said XD
[00:15] jesusabdullah: I came from python, which doesn't roll that way
[00:15] jesusabdullah: it sounds like ruby might?
[00:16] killing-joke: i will tell you after i learn it well enough to write code like that. :D
[00:16] jesusabdullah: based on you saying 'nil' I'm guessing your background is ruby these days :P
[00:16] killing-joke: hah!
[00:18] AAA_awright: jesusabdullah: If this.headers is truthy, it exists, but of course not necessarily the other way around...
[00:19] jesusabdullah: AAA_awright: If it's an object it should be truthy, I meant. You're right in that existence is only a necessary condition for truthiness and not a sufficient one.

[05:45] freeler: anyone here know how to reverse proxy websocket requests through nginx to a node.js socket.io server
[05:45] freeler: ?
[05:47] jesusabdullah: Basically, you can't
[05:47] jesusabdullah: nginx doesn't proxy websockets
[05:47] jesusabdullah: Here's a proxy that can: https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy
[05:48] jesusabdullah: (disclaimer: I work there)
[05:48] freeler: so i can proxy the other way around
[05:48] freeler: from node to nginx for stuff other than websockets ( in my case)
[05:49] freeler: based on what node-http-proxy does
[05:49] Blorb has joined the channel
[05:50] ShinyDarkness has joined the channel
[05:50] YouDontMeanMuch: anybody know how i might go about setting off the system bell w/ node?
[05:50] gkatsev: jesusabdullah: I think the correct terminology is "Shameless plug" rather than "(disclaimer: I work there)" :P
[05:50] blup has joined the channel
[05:51] nakort has joined the channel
[05:52] ShinyDarkness has joined the channel
[05:53] freeler: so note-http-proxy takes the place of using something like connect in that i can send requests for regular http server tpe stuff to nginx (in my case) instead? is that correct?
[05:53] freeler: type*
[05:53] hydrogenesis has joined the channel
[05:54] jacobolus has joined the channel
[05:54] jesusabdullah: shameless plug, then
[05:54] jesusabdullah: freeler: no. It's a proxy. It receives connections and forwards them to the right server.
[05:55] flat: YouDontMeanMuch: console.log('^G');
[05:55] jesusabdullah: For example, at Nodejitsu, requests to *.nodejitsu.com go to proxies (using this library) that forward requests to our application servers
[05:55] freeler: does this have an impact on performance rather than using the http server straight?
[05:55] pct1 has joined the channel
[05:55] freeler: like for example nginx which is already a reverse proxy server
[05:56] jesusabdullah: not noticeably
[05:56] YouDontMeanMuch: flat, thank you
[05:56] flat: YouDontMeanMuch: np
[05:56] freeler: ah ok
[05:56] jesusabdullah: it'd probably lose to haproxy, for example, in a benchmark, but it's also used as a library and not as a configural binary
[05:56] Outsider__ has joined the channel
[05:57] jesusabdullah: so what you probably want to do, is either serve your static assets with node.js, or use a proxy to forward requests for static assets to your nginx server, and application pages to their respective servers
[05:58] jesusabdullah: but yes, you proxy the other way around
[05:59] YouDontMeanMuch: hmm, console.log("^G"), console.log("\^G"), and console.log("\a"); don't seem to work for creating the system bell
[05:59] freeler: so for something like this: http://wesbos.com/html5-canvas-websockets-nodejs/ I would use node-http-proxy to reverse proxy static asset requests to nginx and the websocket requests to node socket.io
[05:59] freeler: that link is the main problem I'm having ^
[06:00] jesusabdullah: Yes
[06:00] jesusabdullah: Or, don't use nginx and use a static fileserver middleware like connect.static or ecstatic (which I wrote)
[06:00] freeler: does it support php?
[06:00] TN: not sure if this is the place to ask, but having some issues with the memcached module :P
[06:00] jesusabdullah: actually, substack might have more lines than that
[06:00] jesusabdullah: No, they're static file servers
[06:01] jesusabdullah: not cgi servers
[06:01] freeler: im guessing there is a module for a cgi server too in node
[06:01] jesusabdullah: Probably
[06:01] blup has joined the channel
[06:01] dubenstein has joined the channel
[06:01] meso has joined the channel
[06:01] jesusabdullah: but I think what you really want to do is have a websocket server, and connect to that url client-side with a statically-served socket.io lib
[06:02] jesusabdullah: because websockets don't actually suffer from cross-site
[06:02] jesusabdullah: might break some of the fallbacks though <_<
[06:02] freeler: im basically trying to run that guy's websocket/html5 canvas setup on a ubuntu server
[06:03] freeler: but yea
[06:03] freeler: on a vps*
[06:03] freeler: but i guess I should look into connect
[06:03] jesusabdullah: Why don't you just download and run it?
[06:03] jesusabdullah: It's a pure node/javascript program
[06:03] jesusabdullah: if that's all you want, then do this:
[06:03] jesusabdullah: https://github.com/wesbos/websocket-canvas-draw download this

[06:05] jesusabdullah: oh geez
[06:06] jesusabdullah: it doesn't even look like he gave you a way to serve it
[06:06] freeler: and I'm like a beginner in node since this past week :/
[06:06] freeler: literally spent hours on this haha
[06:06] jesusabdullah: I hate to say it, but this isn't a very good example :(
[06:06] jesusabdullah: Here
[06:06] jesusabdullah: https://github.com/nodeapps/boilerplates/tree/master/socket.io
[06:06] dexter_e has joined the channel
[06:06] jesusabdullah: Here's a socket.io app I know works
[06:07] jesusabdullah: An easy way to get it is by installing nodejitsu's cli app, jitsu, and then running 'jitsu install' in an empty folder
[06:07] jesusabdullah: It's pretty slick
[06:07] freeler: so how does it work
[06:07] jesusabdullah: https://github.com/nodejitsu/jitsu
[06:08] jesusabdullah: freeler: https://github.com/nodeapps/boilerplates/blob/master/socket.io/bin/server
[06:08] jesusabdullah: This is all the server-side code
[06:08] jesusabdullah: It uses express, which has until very recently been *the* framework for node.js
[06:08] jesusabdullah: now it has competition but is still king
[06:09] freeler: so this deploys on jitsu
[06:09] freeler: or wait...
[06:09] jesusabdullah: http://www.catonmat.net/blog/nodejs-modules-express/
[06:09] jesusabdullah: freeler: No, you can just download those files and run it
[06:10] jesusabdullah: jitsu's just a utility
[06:10] jesusabdullah: freeler: Do you know about npm?
[06:10] freeler: yep
[06:10] jesusabdullah: okay
[06:10] jesusabdullah: good
[06:10] jesusabdullah: just making sure
[06:10] jesusabdullah: I didn't want to get ahead of myself
[06:10] freeler: wait let me install the cli and jitsu and follow the stuff you've told me
[06:10] freeler: one sec
[06:10] jesusabdullah: hah
[06:10] jesusabdullah: alright!
[06:11] jesusabdullah: Yeah, it's part of jitsu's boilerplates package, which is why I suggested it

[06:52] der|: marcello3d: I've just created it, haven't used it on production projects per se. I was planning on using it for a few business startups I'm working with, so I thought to release it to the community, so the project can grow, instead of being an isolated in-house project
[06:52] marcello3d: sure
[06:52] der|: cmr: I built it having big sites in mind, it has (in my opinion) good cache features & approaches
[06:52] cmr: Impressive list of features.
[06:52] marcello3d: I'm not really a coffee guy, but looks like there's a lot of stuff :)

[07:41] cmr: How would I patch a documentation bug.
[07:41] cmr: (For node itself)
[07:41] wereHamster: ACTION needs to clean up temporary uploaded files after PUT/POST requests.
[07:42] augustl: cmr: just edit the docs and send a pull request, I did that once iirc
[07:42] simpleguy: Hello. I want to build a test site using HTML5 Geo-loc API to let users make user-generated map points and store it to a SQL DB and DO NOT want to use PHP. Would Node.js be a usable solution as server-side storage handling and using JS in the site page?
[07:42] cmr: simpleguy: Yep
[07:42] augustl: wereHamster: a http request is just a http request, so the "end" event is sufficient
[07:42] wereHamster: simpleguy: it would be an option just as well as any other server-side language would
[07:43] Morkel has joined the channel
[07:44] cmr: augustl: Hm. In this case I think it's a bug in whatever generates the documents, as the hashtag isn't an inherent part of markdown.
[07:44] simpleguy: cmr werehamster bare with me here... Node / [other server-side language] would not impede on making the site usable on old-ass phones (think nokia music express) would it? No browser dependencies? (other than geo-loc of course)
[07:44] cmr: simpleguy: No, as it is server-side, it doesn't rely on any part of the browser.
[07:44] augustl: cmr: ah, not sure where that code lives
[07:44] simpleguy: cmr thought as much. Tx
[07:44] simpleguy: Now to have an excuse to learn node
[07:45] augustl: simpleguy: it may be a concern in practice, though. There's a bunch of libraries with a node part and a browser part that you may or may not want to use in your application
[07:45] augustl: faye, socket.io, etc
[07:46] simpleguy: august1 I'd just have to look around for usable libraries or modules...

[11:40] pity: No uncaughtException listener is registered about the http server

[11:40] pity: It will create too much listeners
[11:40] pity: and it will crash due a limit of listeners
[11:43] LeMike has joined the channel
[11:45] Glenjamin: pity: unregister it at the end of the request
[11:46] Glenjamin: so you'll have one global application handler, and one per-request handler
[11:48] pity: but in case of high concurrency there will be also a lot of error listeners
[11:49] pity: this probably does not have any good solution

[22:48] tbranyen: mmalecki: it was written a long time ago
[22:48] tbranyen: it needs a rewrite with some better practices
[22:48] isaacs: tbranyen: i'd suspect that git has issues with that file, also, then
[22:48] isaacs: tbranyen: is it generated or something?
[22:48] tbranyen: isaacs: weird it shows up in github as committed fine
