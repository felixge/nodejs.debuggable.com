[00:08] AvianFlu: it's a CLI tool for node-static, put briefly
[00:08] bksf: for serving static files in additon to a dynamic backend?
[00:08] jellosea: how do i export/import a module so that i can just straight away go new ClassA() instead of var something = require(foo); new something.ClassA()

[00:18] tjholowaychuk: well node isn't a language
[00:18] jellosea: isaacs: oh okay
[00:18] tjholowaychuk: but yeah i find it better to work with
[00:18] tjholowaychuk: more natural
[00:18] ctide: tjholowaychuk: are all tests passing for you with node v0.4.9 for express?
[00:18] level09: you mean as in syntax 
[00:18] ctide: i pulled it down earlier, and was getting a few failures
[00:18] tjholowaychuk: ctide one is failing right now
[00:18] Yuffster_work: Ruby and JavaScript are quite similar, but Ruby is slightly more open to modifications.
[00:19] tjholowaychuk: ruby is a clusterfuck more or less
[00:19] tjholowaychuk: so is js, but less so
[00:19] Yuffster_work: You can't make a method in JS called `.
[00:19] level09: :)
[00:19] ctide: https://gist.github.com/16bb8f1e4f4b39fc82b1 was what i was seeing
[00:19] level09: I like how easy to learn node is
[00:20] tjholowaychuk: ctide ah yup i have those right now as well, just haven't had time to fix them
[00:20] ctide: ok cool
[00:20] ctide: just making sure
[00:20] level09: but it is still kind of tricky learning the async thing
[00:20] ctide: i also just opened a pull request
[00:20] Yuffster_work: Asynchrnous is fun, though.

[00:21] pquerna: http://www.dougfirlounge.com/
[00:21] level09: Yuffster_work: it is still linear , but every new step must be moved to the callback instead on the next line
[00:22] SubStack: node is like the tardis
[00:22] mikey_p: http://www.jupiterhotel.com/
[00:22] Yuffster_work: level09: Thinking of it wrong. ;)
[00:22] Yuffster_work: SubStack: has it right, you need to watch all of Doctor Who (even the original episodes that have been lost), and then you will understand JavaScript.
[00:22] level09: it is way easier when you know that the next line won't execute unless the first line is executed :D
[00:22] SubStack: especially blink
[00:23] level09: for simple loops I have to write recursive functions now :)
[00:23] Yuffster_work: But not the other episode with the weeping angels because they were crap in that episode.

[01:09] Nexxy: jesusabdullah, that's obscene!
[01:09] jesusabdullah: D:
[01:09] Nuck: konobi: Well, my CTO was able to debate with him recently
[01:09] jesusabdullah: I'm not obscene!
[01:09] Nuck: And I'd honestly say mine is a bit more knowledgable, if less experienced.
[01:10] jesusabdullah: Obviously it's for writing down certain equations
[01:10] Nuck: dA's CTO is one of those "throw money at the problem" guys
[01:10] execution: hmm, dotcloud looks clean and well-priced, but the gallery shows that no one notable is using them. nodejitsu, on the other hand, looks too new/young/startupy. heroku is crazy expensive. then there's joyent... going to check out their prices now
[01:10] konobi: Nuck: *shrug* andy's pretty sharp... though quite business-ey
[01:10] materialdesigner has joined the channel
[01:10] Nuck: konobi: Andy?  Hmmm, must not be their CTO I'm thinking of
[01:10] jesusabdullah: Nexxy: I actually with it came with :, ), (, ; and < as well
[01:10] Nuck: konobi: I meant their SA, sorry
[01:10] Nuck: mixed up terms
[01:10] Nuck: chris
[01:10] jesusabdullah: as funny as i think the idea is, I think I'd get bored with it pretty quick
[01:11] konobi: Nuck: chris bolt, yeah
[01:11] Nuck: konobi: You know the guys at dA?
[01:11] konobi: yup
[01:11] tmzt: jesusabdullah: the secret is participating in 15 post long threads on HN
[01:11] jesusabdullah: tmzt: Huh?
[01:11] Nuck: konobi: lol they think Node doesn't scale
[01:11] Nuck: They told me that
[01:11] Nuck: And I giggled.
[01:11] jesusabdullah: tmzt: Why would I go to hater news?
[01:11] jesusabdullah: whaat
[01:11] Nuck: Because they're on PHP + MySQL
[01:12] Nuck: The least scalable stack I've ever seen.
[01:12] Nexxy: oh cuz php scales!
[01:12] albertosheinfeld has joined the channel
[01:12] d0k has joined the channel
[01:12] Nuck: riiiiiiight, it scales wonderfully.
[01:12] jesusabdullah: I'm of the belief that anything can scale if you have enough of it
[01:12] tmzt: any chance that php could ever support a long lived process properly?
[01:12] Nuck: jesusabdullah: lol fair enough :P

[01:12] konobi: Nuck: their CTO and ryan have talked at length over drink before

[01:12] jesusabdullah: Spin up ALL the instances!
[01:12] bksf: anyone here using node on heroku with a db?
[01:12] jesusabdullah: More bash scripts! MORE
[01:12] Elems: if I have an object like this, http://pastebin.com/PC93m6KU , I get an error about child1 being undefined. What would the proper way of doing this be?

[01:13] thepatr1ck: bksf: I'm using it to talk to a couch instance at cloudant
[01:13] Nuck: konobi: I know, but all of deviantTech "informed" me that Node doesn't scale well during a recent chat.
[01:13] konobi: Nuck: there;s a C/C++ bias there, not a php one =0)
[01:13] Nuck: konobi: They all know C, but their servers for their site are all PHP
[01:13] konobi: infact, i believe they were looking at java too
[01:14] jesusabdullah: yessch, java
[01:14] ekryski has joined the channel
[01:14] jesusabdullah: I kinda wanna learn me some clojure though
[01:14] bksf: thepatr1ck: i like the structure of couch, im an advanced front and backend dev ... but coming from php then ruby to node (which i feel comfortable with the syntax of). is couch persistent? sorry not too familiar with it ...
[01:14] Nuck: Java scales well, but finding a truly competent Java dev is harder than you'd think.
[01:14] jesusabdullah: when I have time
[01:14] konobi: actually, reminds me i need to call andy at some point to grab drinks
[01:14] jesusabdullah: and stop being lazy
[01:14] Nexxy: THERE IS NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT
[01:14] Nuck: tmzt: Long-lived processes?  That's EASY.  Just use php-cli.
[01:14] Nuck: Duh.
[01:15] Nexxy: Nuck--
[01:15] catb0t: Nuck now has 2 beers

[01:15] zeade has joined the channel
[01:15] Nuck: lol
[01:15] thepatr1ck: bksf: couch is persistent, but is document based and doesn't support queries - you have to use map/reduce views, but that's not a minus for my use case
[01:15] bksf: word gotcha.
[01:15] Nuck: deviantART will never upgrade their tech.
[01:16] tmzt: Nuck: only works if you have a routing framework
[01:16] Nuck: They've invested far too much in PHP
[01:16] bksf: im saving social media account info. best thoughts for heroku/node db?
[01:16] Nuck: tmzt: Minor detail :P
[01:16] Nuck: bksf: Dunno, would Mongo work on Heroku?
[01:16] konobi: Nuck: if it ain't broke, why fix it?
[01:16] AvianFlu has joined the channel
[01:16] tmzt: turns out it's easy to build apis by dropping php files in folders
[01:16] jesusabdullah: php-cli? What's that?
[01:16] Nuck: konobi: I disagree, they still have issues with their site breaking daily.
[01:16] thepatr1ck: bksf: couch also has rather nice replication, and with that a remote change notification feed that can give you a rather nice way of (combined with socket.io) pushing updates live to all clients without needing your node's to be talking to each other
[01:16] jesusabdullah: I think I would honestly use forever for most of my process monitoring
[01:17] jesusabdullah: It's, like, the process monitor I wish I had for my thesis

[01:17] Nuck: konobi: The entire community agrees dA hasn't fixed any of the glitches on-site in years.
[01:17] Nuck: It's quite sad.
[01:17] konobi: Nuck: heh, yeah i haven't used the site in about 10 years really =0)
[01:17] jesusabdullah: Nuck: Making a better dA?
[01:17] jesusabdullah: I bet you could do that
[01:17] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Who's to say I won't :3
[01:17] bksf: thepatr1ck: sweet thanks man -
[01:17] tmzt: Nuck: i've done pieces and parts of one
[01:17] jesusabdullah: Make dA and ComicGenesis have a baby that studied with Dr. Imgur Dotcom
[01:18] tmzt: in node :)
[01:18] jesusabdullah: and went on to become good friends with node.js, obviously
[01:18] Nuck: konobi: I've been hanging out on their chats for about a year and a half.  The chats go down at least once or twice a week, have glitches that have stayed there for 6 years straight, and the JS for the client fits the traditional defition of spaghetti code
[01:19] Nuck: Plus some of their static servers are incorrectly configured
[01:19] Nuck: Causing all CSS, JS, and images to 404
[01:19] Nuck: tmzt: I have too ;)
[01:20] Nuck: That's the startup lol
[01:20] Nuck: I wanna provide an art site built from the ground up on modern architecture.
[01:20] tmzt: now there's express-resource which I should have just built when I needed it
[01:20] tmzt: oh that recommendation thing you've been talking about?
[01:20] jesusabdullah: Some people think this hypothetical startup and node.js are dating, but they're not saying
[01:21] jesusabdullah: We have, however, seen the way they look at each other! SOMETHING IS THERE DAMMIT
[01:21] dreamdust: A one person team will have a tough time even coming close to building something on the level of DeviantArt...
[01:22] jesusabdullah: That's why there's an entire team
[01:22] Nuck: Two noders, a mobile app dev, and one of the best SAs I've ever known.
[01:22] jesusabdullah: of leet hackers
[01:22] jesusabdullah: Something Awful?

[01:26] jewgonewild: hey curious if anyone is building a chat like service running on multiple node servers .. wondering if anyone is handling state with redis and using a simple tcp node balancer .. haproxy etc in front of the nodes... 
[01:26] jewgonewild: ^load balancer.. not node balancer 
[01:26] Xeon06_ has joined the channel
[01:27] bminer: ummm... i've run Node on EC2
[01:27] bminer: using Redis to handle state
[01:27] bminer: i haven't used a load balancer yet, but it seems like it would be extremely straight-forward
[01:27] ank has joined the channel
[01:28] jewgonewild: bminer .. yeah running it on ec2 as well for now .. I only have 1 node server so I use objects to handle mapping of rooms <-> users 
[01:28] bminer: i dunno if Amazon uses haproxy... they have their own load balancing service
[01:28] nuck-mobile has joined the channel
[01:28] bminer: sure
[01:29] neoesque has joined the channel
[01:29] bminer: yeah you can also map users to rooms using Socket.IO 0.7 now
[01:29] bminer: are you using Socket.IO?
[01:29] jewgonewild: yeah bminer i use that for my web based views
[01:29] lot49 has joined the channel
[01:29] bminer: cool, using Express or Connect?
[01:30] jewgonewild: but I have a mobile chat room that uses straight sockets, not websockets
[01:30] nuck-mobile: Wow socket.io sounds epic for chat :D
[01:30] captain_morgan has joined the channel
[01:30] emet has joined the channel
[01:30] bminer: nuck-mobile, yeah socket.io is definitely the library for anything real-time and Node related
[01:31] tmzt: it's heavy and sometimes unpredictable
[01:31] bminer: so hey... this is a message for everyone.... anyone used SocketStream AND Express web frameworks?
[01:31] bminer: any opinions on them?
[01:31] tmzt: it tries a bunch of protocols that don't really work (multipart http??)
[01:31] nuck-mobile: I want to build it on joltproject.com's protocol and client (I have access to both) but use socket.io for the access layer
[01:31] jewgonewild: it is pretty epic for chat .. I wrote that part in literally 15 minutes with socket.io 
[01:31] tmzt: socketstream expects you to do everything their way
[01:31] tmzt: down to the directory structure
[01:32] elliottcable: Nexxy: We lost you )=
[01:32] bminer: tmzt - yes I agree
[01:32] bminer: the other thing I don't like about SocketStream is the single-page application concept....
[01:32] bminer: or well... i should clarify... i love the concept, but it kills SEO
[01:32] nuck-mobile: All I'll have to do is build a server. Might have my other noder work on if when they get going
[01:32] Nexxy: elliottcable, I lost myself too ;<
[01:32] boogyman has joined the channel
[01:33] bminer: SocketStream also adds some REALLY cool functionality like API trees, shared code between client/server, RPC, etc.
[01:33] sholden: does anyone know how i can set a timeout for dns requests?  it's making my http requests hang waaay longer than i want them to
[01:33] Nexxy: basically a bunch of things that are already available in existing packages?!
[01:34] bminer: i suppose that's true
[01:34] bminer: it's just nice to start with a robust framework
[01:34] nuck-mobile: bminer: I plan to use pushState for my single-page setup so my seo shouldn't suffer 
[01:34] nuck-mobile: Plus it's not socket driven, it's all REST.

[01:35] jewgonewild_ has joined the channel
[01:35] bminer: i am not a true fan of REST... btw... just use GET and POST and forget about it
[01:36] nuck-mobile: bminer: it's not a problem, pushState means I'm using normal urls and such
[01:36] jewgonewild_: I like that socket.io abstracts away a lot .. 
[01:36] bminer: nuck-mobile: i'm interested... how does that work exactly?
[01:36] abraxas has joined the channel
[01:36] bminer: nuck-mobile: do you have a link I can read up on it?
[01:37] nuck-mobile: bminer: it's simple: you use normal links, preventDefaulr, then pushState and Ajax to update the URL and page (respectively)
[01:37] tmzt: pushState?
[01:38] tbranyen: tmzt: he means html5 history api
[01:38] tmzt: okay
[01:38] tbranyen: which allows you to maintain browser state and change the url without refreshing the page
[01:38] nuck-mobile: It's what Facebook and github use for stuff, and yes, that's right.
[01:39] tbranyen: well i mean you can't just use pushState
[01:39] tbranyen: I gave a talk on this stuff a while back that explains one method of working with HTML5 history navigation backed by a server... its still not very easy to do cleanly
[01:39] nuck-mobile: I'll use a link-overriding thing similarly for hashurls too
[01:39] tbranyen: I've been messing with backbone to alleviate some code duplication
[01:39] bminer: nuck-mobile: alright fine, but what about incompatible browsers????
[01:39] tbranyen: bminer: f em, just load pages from the server
[01:39] elliottcable: Nexxy: → ##Paws!
[01:40] nuck-mobile: bminer: falls back like tbraynen said.
[01:40] tbranyen: Those are people who aren't going to be looking for a fast experience anyways
[01:40] tbranyen: anyone running modern firefox, chrome, opera, etc. will get it, but IE users unfortunately are still left out
[01:41] saurabhverma has joined the channel
[01:41] nuck-mobile: But I'll also be providing hash urls as a fallback. If the page has a hash URL on load, but the browser supports pushState, it'll fix it
[01:41] tbranyen: nuck-mobile: that sucks tho, since those aren't easily bookmarkable
[01:41] tbranyen: servers can't read hashs data
[01:41] MarkMenard has joined the channel
[01:41] tbranyen: you'll have to write even more code to handle rendering the correct page after / has already loaded
[01:42] nuck-mobile: Tbraynen: I'm thinking about that, and wondering if it's a problem.
[01:42] nuck-mobile: And my entire site is one page anyways
[01:42] bminer: so let me get this straight.... i use pushState to trick the browser to display a new URL in the address bar. Client JS loads a page or page fragment and replaces a DOM element, for example?
[01:42] emet: is mongodb typically used with node.js
[01:42] tbranyen: mine is sorta the same thing.  client side its one page, but you can hit any pages and they will be immediately rendered by the server
[01:42] tbranyen: emet: i'm using it
[01:43] tbranyen: bminer: sure
[01:43] nuck-mobile: bminer: that about sums it up, I think
[01:43] bminer: I also hook my JS to any anchor tags?
[01:43] tbranyen: and forms probably
[01:43] tbranyen: those are the only two i know of that would need it
[01:43] bminer: so my <a> and <form> tags point to REAL links
[01:43] tbranyen: yes
[01:43] CrabDude: bminer: and when you go "back" to the faux url, it pops whatever object you stored in the history stack, presumably your state to repopulate the page
[01:43] nuck-mobile: Tbraynen: I don't return any HTML from the server ever
[01:43] tmzt: bminer: you can do that with just jquery as well
[01:43] bminer: nuck-mobile: hmmm.... interesting stuff
[01:43] tbranyen: nuck-mobile: ah, thats where we differ then
[01:44] nuck-mobile: All is json through a restful api
[01:44] tmzt: I've used $("a[href='/whatever']") a few times
[01:44] tbranyen: nuck-mobile: yeah i have that too
[01:44] tmzt: the problem is navigation doesn't always work that way
[01:44] tbranyen: but i want every page to load ridic fast
[01:44] tmzt: because if you set the location.href it actually goes to taht that page
[01:44] nuck-mobile: Same but rest is pretty wicked fast
[01:45] tbranyen: nuck-mobile: not fast enough that i don't notice it :-/
[01:45] tbranyen: i can tell when stuff is loaded async on the first load
[01:45] tbranyen: and i care most about that first page load
[01:45] tbranyen: than the rest
[01:46] nuck-mobile: It'll be rested in on later pageloads
[01:46] albertosheinfeld has joined the channel
[01:46] harthur has joined the channel
[01:46] tbranyen: also its kind of nice knowing my site will load in any browser regardless of JS support
[01:46] tbranyen: one thing thats cool is conditionally caching your templates and data nuck-mobile 
[01:47] tbranyen: you can get some huge speed boosts there
[01:47] nuck-mobile: Well yeah I'm gonna do like fb or gh with regular fallbacks
[01:47] tbranyen: have node poll for file changes and update a hash with the crc and then use that as the e-tag
[01:48] nuck-mobile: Lolwat
[01:48] tbranyen: thats what i've been thinking
[01:48] tbranyen: instead of doing it per request
[01:48] tmzt: tbranyen: bminer: actually, you can still use hashtag navigation with real urls
[01:49] CrabDude has left the channel
[01:49] nuck-mobile: Oh I see to check if the source is modified
[01:49] tbranyen: yeea
[01:49] CrabDude has joined the channel
[01:49] tbranyen: tmzt: huh
[01:49] tmzt: it's easye enough to support both and wildcard route on the server
[01:49] fengshaun has joined the channel
[01:49] tmzt: returning the same page for any url requested
[01:49] tmzt: then detect the location as you would for a hash
[01:49] tbranyen: tmzt: yeah and that looks like crap
[01:49] tbranyen: unfortunately
[01:49] tbranyen: its a poor solution
[01:49] tbranyen: to something that isn't a problem
[01:49] tmzt: how would it look like anything?
[01:49] tmzt: HTTP is just a protocol transferring resources
[01:50] dreamdust: No… tmzt is talking about having /#/events and /events resolve to the same thing.
[01:50] tbranyen: because it needs to load a generic page until the client can ping back the hash url
[01:50] fengshaun: I just learned about node.js today.  And before I start, I wanted to know: is node its own server or does it need a web server like apache, etc.?
[01:50] tmzt: and 'same page'
[01:50] tmzt: actually no, you can do the same routing server side if you prefer
[01:50] tbranyen: dreamdust: yes i know
[01:50] tbranyen: and it looks bad
[01:50] tmzt: and serve the same partials
[01:50] tbranyen: tmzt: its not possible to do it as clean as history api
[01:50] tmzt: by same page I mean same code handling it (easy in node, not so much in php for instance)
[01:51] dreamdust: The only way to do history tied to URL's is hashes.
[01:51] dreamdust: You can do an iframe history
[01:51] dreamdust: but you won't have a URL in the address bar
[01:51] tmzt: right, because you fix up the url to a hash address if js is enabled
[01:51] nuck-mobile: Aren't there any Ajax-ifying libs yet?
[01:52] apejens: fengshaun: quite new myself, but it is easy to write a stand alone server with node.js. IF that is how most people deploy things I don't know (the things I ahve deployed, is deployed like that)
[01:52] tbranyen: you have more symapthy for users of crappy browsers than i do :-p
[01:52] tmzt: apejens: that or with a reverse proxy in front
[01:52] nuck-mobile: That'll do like socket.io and unify ahit
[01:52] fengshaun: apejens: thanks!  But I want to know what is the common deployment method.
[01:53] dreamdust: @fengshaun many people use Connect
[01:53] dreamdust: http://senchalabs.github.com/connect/
[01:53] fengshaun: dreamdust: thanks!
[01:53] tmzt: dreamdust: you talking about spark?
[01:53] nuck-mobile: That's deployment?
[01:54] dreamdust: Oh… sorry fengshuan I misread your quesiton
[01:54] dreamdust: blah
[01:54] nuck-mobile: Last I checked connectwas just a middleware lib
[01:55] fengshaun: dreamdust: oh!
[01:55] fengshaun: that's alright.
[01:55] AAA_awright: nuck-mobile: I would strongly recommend against hash-bang URLs, they don't mean anything to the web server and thus you can't return a proper 404 or other things like you should be able to with a HEAD request. It's one of those things you can never go back... I would just sugguest a traditional page load, period.
[01:55] tbranyen: AAA_awright: +1
[01:55] dreamdust: Agreed.

[02:34] Nuck: AAA_awright: My new node guy took my multi-paragraph algorithm and turned it into a 5-line function.
[02:34] Nuck: Best of all, it follows the map, reduce setup, where you map out the results, then reduce them.
[02:34] Nuck: (I might add, this setup is what Google uses)
[02:34] gazumps has joined the channel
[02:35] AAA_awright: multi-paragraph, what's that?
[02:35] Nuck: AAA_awright: It means I wrote it out in plain English
[02:35] konobi: Nuck: schwartzian transform?
[02:35] Nuck: He made my entire sorting mechanism in 5 lines
[02:36] Nuck: (it'll probable be blown into about 10 lines)
[02:36] Lorentz: Give him a raise
[02:36] Nuck: It's fucking efficient, now that I look at it
[02:36] Nuck: It can effectively sort using VERY little iteration.
[02:36] Nuck: (well, not sorting an array, but generating a value for each)
[02:36] AAA_awright: Nuck: Oh oh, I thought you meant some paragraph-splitting algorithm, no you mean yours
[02:36] Xeon06_ has joined the channel
[02:37] Nuck: AAA_awright: yeah, the entire sorting mechanism in 5 lines.

[02:37] irrumato1_ has joined the channel
[02:37] bradleymeck: Array.sort is soo hard to fin beat though in practice
[02:37] Nuck: Though my "values" will get a bit high with lots of inputs.
[02:37] Nuck: bradleymeck: Not sorting an array
[02:37] bradleymeck: cant always be used though
[02:37] AAA_awright: Nuck: Well I still don't have your description of what it's supposed to _do_, I'm still thinking of my idea which calculates a probability of favorite/like based on past ones
[02:37] Nuck: Sorting a simple array by values.
[02:38] Nuck: Err derp
[02:38] Nuck: It'll be algorithmically ranking it.
[02:38] Nuck: AAA_awright: That's the general purpose, but I'm keeping it safe inside my company.
[02:38] Nuck: It's our core feature
[02:38] konobi: Nuck: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwartzian_transform

[02:40] tracker1: (spidermonkey based port of node)...  mainly curious if anyone has used it, if e4x is enabled, and how the performance compares...
[02:40] Nuck: konobi: That's not a sorting algorithm, is it?
[02:40] AAA_awright: Nuck: We can talk about it in private but, are you familiar with http://www.artspots.com/ ? They have some sugguestion for similar art, if not calculated for you individually
[02:40] konobi: yup
[02:40] konobi: a rather efficient one too
[02:41] Nuck: konobi: Well, the concept is to look at tags on uploads and tags that the user likes, then associate the sorting value to the id of each upload
[02:41] Nuck: And then just sort by the value
[02:42] Nuck: The sorting value is where the secret magic happens
[02:42] Nuck: it's not based on x relative to y
[02:42] konobi: so it's a weighted set as the result of a union?
[02:42] captain_morgan has joined the channel
[02:43] Nuck: konobi: Yeah, that about sums it up.  We've got some optimizations on the set-retrieval too, of course, otherwise that'd be a LOT of data to process.
[02:43] AAA_awright: Nuck: Talking multiplication and tags and stuff as I understand it would be easy to implement, and is probably well suited for map-reduce, but I can't imagine it's very good or accurately predicts what users would like
[02:44] Nuck: AAA_awright: Surprisingly, it worked effectively on test groups.
[02:44] Nuck: I think it's the rule of KISS
[02:44] Nuck: It's so simple it's actually very efficient.
[02:45] lot49_ has joined the channel
[02:45] konobi: sounds similar to a hotel search engine I worked on once
[02:45] Nuck: Before, I was worried that the sorting algorithm would be a major bottleneck, since it'd hafta be computed a lot.  However, seeing the simplicity of an implementation, it'll be more of a bottleneck in the optimizing.
[02:45] konobi: though that was crazier due to use of hilberts curve
[02:45] konobi: worked for the data though
[02:46] Nuck: konobi: we're gonna cull the obvious outliers before set retrieval, keep a cached weightlist for tags on each user, etc. - overall, it's gonna be a highly efficient algorith,
[02:47] Swizec has joined the channel
[02:47] Nuck: The problem lies entirely in narrowing down the set before we run the sort over it
[02:47] Nuck: But even that should be feasible with minimal quality loss on the algorithm.
[02:48] dgathright has joined the channel
[02:48] Nuck: And if there are still problems, that algorithm can run on a separate Node instance.
[02:49] AAA_awright: Nuck: How are you testing?
[02:49] Nuck: AAA_awright: Generating our own testing data sets, using shitty fanart as examples lol
[02:49] AAA_awright: Doing prediction, you trained on a test set, and test on separate experimental data
[02:50] aconbere has joined the channel
[02:50] konobi: genetic algorithm time!
[02:50] sechrist has joined the channel
[02:52] Nuck: The example last night was sonic fanart, actually.
[02:52] Nuck: It'll keep us laughing as it returns yiffing, I'm sure :P
[02:53] AAA_awright: Again maybe this is me not understanding the purpose, but if you're testing for subjective things like that you need actual data that reflects people's complexities
[02:53] lot49 has joined the channel
[02:53] Nuck: AAA_awright: The thing we're testing is if it properly sorts relevant artwork for a given person's preferences.
[02:53] AAA_awright: Biggest example I can think of, Netflix was trained on half the data set and tested on the other half, of every rating that people inputted
[02:54] Nuck: We input weighted tags
[02:54] Nuck: And a data set
[02:54] Nuck: And the sorting algorithm spits out ordered data
[02:54] edude03 has joined the channel
[02:54] AAA_awright: You can mathematically prove you're supposed to use half the data too, if it matters, instead of, say, training on 2/3 and testing on 1/3rd
[02:54] Nuck: Simple enough.
[02:55] Nuck: AAA_awright: We're laid-back folks, we develop using fucked-up example data, then to test it better, we do alpha testing.
[02:56] Nuck: The only way to test if it's gonna work is to let a small ecosystem develop around the site, and then see if it holds up

[05:36] ibolmo has joined the channel
[05:36] tig: what's the environment variable I have to set so node can find its modules?
[05:36] thepatr1ck: tig: node just looks node_modules in the current directory, then in the parent directory, and so on and so on and so on (until it runs out of directories ;)), but then also looks in other places - require.paths tells you where it looks (0.5.2 changes that to a function call or something)
[05:36] AvianFlu: don't use require.paths
[05:36] ibolmo: anyone know if it's appropriate to ask requirejs questions here? perhaps a better channel?
[05:36] AvianFlu: there's a NODE_ENV environment variable or something, I'll go look for the link
[05:36] Xeon06_ has joined the channel
[05:37] tig: thepatr1ck, well npm is instnalling stuff to  /usr/local/lib/node_modules  so I need it to look there

[05:37] AvianFlu: disregard NODE_ENV, I'm confused

[05:38] tig: heh, would be nice if npm and node could just agree on where to put things though

[05:38] tig: since the default doesn't seem to work
[05:38] ibolmo: i'm doing this: require([depA, depB], onReady); except I'm expecting that onReady will only get called after depA, and depB are "ready".. meaning if depA is: require([depC, depD], onReadyA) and so on
[05:38] ibolmo: right now i'm logging that onReadyA is being called prior to onReady
[05:39] tig: ibolmo, well there is a require.ready(callback)
[05:39] tig: but I'm surprised that would happen for you

[05:42] Nuck: ...
[05:42] tig: oh wait
[05:42] tig: I know the problem
[05:42] tig: you're supposed to use define() for modules, not require()
[05:42] Nuck: the fuck just happened?

[05:42] ibolmo: oh

[07:18] jesusabdullah: stuk1: EE2 is backwards compatible
[07:18] tig: which aren't installed for some reason

[07:19] stuk1: jesusabdullah: but EE has been removed in 0.5.2, that's why I need to use something different :)
[07:19] tig: hey guys, how do you get node to install with the header files?
[07:19] jesusabdullah: stuk1: This is also in pure js
[07:19] jesusabdullah: stuk1: I don't know anything about the c++ side of EEs

[07:20] stuk1: jesusabdullah: ah k, the module is pretty much all in c++
[07:20] stuk1: thanks
[07:20] jesusabdullah: I SEE
[07:20] techwraith: https://gist.github.com/1108845
[07:20] jesusabdullah: stuk1: It's pretty easy to implement your own EE, at least in dynamic languages
[07:20] jesusabdullah: stuk1: I did it in python after all: https://github.com/jesusabdullah/pyee
[07:21] jesusabdullah: Actually that module got like 40 watchers which is a LOT for me
[07:21] jesusabdullah: I have no idea how that happened
[07:21] jesusabdullah: well, I kinda do
[07:21] jesusabdullah: I got reflog'd

[08:59] gozala has joined the channel
[09:00] tig: for example, lets say you have a function that generates a UUID.  Then later you decide you want to use postgres' builtin function for that.  But that requires touching the database, which means you need a callback.  Now your function can't just return the value anymore -- it has to have a callback too

[09:11] medice: if i want to add new function to array prototype from within module, how would that be done

[09:12] chjj: medice: you mean `Array.prototype.func = function() {};` ?
[09:12] medice: right, but will that be accessible from outside the module?
[09:12] tuhoojabotti: Yes
[09:12] chjj: yes
[09:12] chjj: its the same global context
[09:12] medice: oh, alright then, then i have no trouble

[09:13] guidocalvano has joined the channel
[09:13] jetienne: medice: this is your code. but many considere it is bad to change global objects
[09:13] jetienne: because it may create conflict and unexpected behavior down the road. but once again this is your code
[09:14] chjj: just be very careful, make sure you dont break any internal code by doing that, and dont ever extend the Object prototype
[09:14] Twisol: my personal rule is: libraries shouldn't, but you can. So if you're writing a library, avoid it.
[09:14] michaelhartau has joined the channel
[09:14] jetienne: my rule is: dont (there is always another way)
[09:14] medice: screw the rules, i have money
[09:15] chjj: yeah, as long as youre in control of the environment its ok, but you need to be careful, it generally isnt a good idea
[09:15] tuhoojabotti: :)
[09:15] chjj: especially becauses theres internal code executing in node, if it tests an object by testing for a certain property, and you extend to array prototype with a property that has the same name
[09:15] chjj: youre in trouble
[09:16] ank has joined the channel

[09:16] chjj: yeah
[09:16] Twisol: Gotta be aware of duck typing
[09:18] framlin: medice: so you should realy at LEAST do: if (typoef array.func === 'undefined'){ //patch array wiith func }
[09:18] chjj: Also if you're going to do it, make it non-enumerable so for..in doesnt pick it up

[09:41] Xeon06_ has joined the channel
[09:42] shanebo: AvianFlu async looks great. especially series, but I'm not sure it's recursive is it?
[09:43] chjj: shanebo: what do you mean recursive? its possible to write something that is both async and recursive by hand, i dont see how any library would make it any easier
[09:44] shanebo: let's see if i can pseudo code it
[09:44] chjj: i mean, the async part, yes
[09:44] chjj: but the recursive part, youd do that yourself
[09:45] shanebo: chjj but I want to keep that logic out of the controller action if possible
[09:45] shanebo: use case would be something like that
[09:45] shanebo: middleware runs steps:
[09:45] AvianFlu: shanebo: there's an async.forEach, I haven't used it myself but it MIGHT do what you want

[09:49] chjj: ok
[09:49] shanebo: so what's happening is that my steps work at level one, but anything in the action level doesn't stop the train so when it calls back it doesn't have what it needs to continue
[09:50] AvianFlu: I mean, for one thing, you could do some kind of `if (this should not fire) { nextFn() }

[17:04] xerox: ah I see
[17:04] xerox: if I don't process.exit it's pretty nice
[17:05] xerox: first ^C does the clean up, the second quits
[17:05] xerox: I might do some semaphore to know if the cleanups are finished, and a callback to set the semaphore back
[17:06] MooGoo: yea I did something like that to keep myself from accidently killing the bot

[18:15] NickABusey: Anyone have any idea when Heroku will add support for Websockets? Or a suggestion for an alternative host that does support them that also has free dev accounts?
[18:15] xerox: tjholowaychuk: do you know if it is possible to run it on code without tests, to check what parts of the source are never used? (instead of what part of the source is not tested)
[18:15] explodes: Hi, just installed vows with some tests.
[18:15] tjholowaychuk: xerox yeah for sure
[18:15] xerox: tjholowaychuk: wow that would really make my day
[18:15] tjholowaychuk: xerox though I warn you it adds a lot of bulk to the library
[18:15] tjholowaychuk: (the instrumentation)
[18:15] tjholowaychuk: so it will be slower
[18:16] explodes: er, and made some tests.  Running vows in my src directory (which has a test directory) says there are no tests to be found.  There is a file test_datetime.js ...

[18:16] chapel: whats the difference?
[18:16] chapel: good change?
[18:16] `3rdEden: FF5> and latest chromium use websocket specs that we don't support yet
[18:16] `3rdEden: different handshakes
[18:16] chapel: ah
[18:16] `3rdEden: different encodings
[18:17] tjholowaychuk: xerox cool :D yeah should be easy enough to do that
[18:17] chapel: well xhr-polling is adequate
[18:17] chapel: and most people dont run dev
[18:17] xerox: tjholowaychuk: I poked around and compiled and tried but I can't get it to do what you said is possible, would you mind walking me through? or something : )
[18:17] xerox: I'm excited!
[18:17] `3rdEden: chapel basically we need to write 2 more websocket parsers for socket.io
[18:17] chapel: fun
[18:17] `3rdEden: one for spec:7 and spec:8, not that much fun :p
[18:17] jbrokc: if you supply a cwd to child_process.exec's 2nd paremeter of options, will it change to that directory?

[18:19] jokil: bnoordhuis: I've been trying it and I can't get much meaningful data out of it. I only see very rough numbers. I would like it to show the specific runtimes for each function in the system and perhaps how many times it was called

[18:37] Nuck: ACTION still can't believe Gary Busey named his penis after a day of the week
[18:38] doctorm: Ok, so I guess modules naturally act as singletons. Does that mean if I create a connection like - exports.myconn = new Memcached(127.0.0.1:11211) that connection won't be recreated if the module is required in multiple places?

[18:43] mbrevoor_: isaacs: was thinking today that it would be nice if instead of having to replicate the entire NPM couchdb db, it would be nice to be able to layer and proxy npm registries or maybe just add a namespace to packages so you can map a namespace to a particular registry
[18:43] thriple has joined the channel
[18:43] isaacs: mbrevoor_: you can do that with a replication filter, i'm told
[18:44] isaacs: mbrevoor_: but since npm already has the functionality to look somewhere else for a given package, it'd be nice to just replicate in { url: "http://registry.npmjs.org/pkgname" } for a package
[18:45] bksf: i have a socket.io/node.js app. it's pretty brief. working locally is fine so far - yet on heroku i get errors sometimes causing crashes. the code is pretty brief - http://pastebin.com/DEt2D52X  the error is http.js:572
[18:45] bksf: 2011-07-27T18:39:42+00:00 app[web.1]:     throw new Error("Can't render headers after they are sent to the client.")
[18:46] sweetd has joined the channel
[18:46] bksf: im relatively new to nodejs but not web, headers etc i dont see anywhere where i am setting headers ...
[18:46] mbrevoor_: isaacs: not following completely, so npm can look somewhere else for the actual package, right? but, correctly if I'm wrong, there can be only one registry
[18:46] sridatta: anyone know what's happened to nithub?
[18:47] isaacs: mbrevoor_: yes, you are correct.
[18:47] isaacs: mbrevoor_: but a package entry can be { "name" : "foo", "url" : "http://foo-registry.com/foo" }
[18:47] isaacs: mbrevoor_: oh, also needs maintainers.
[18:47] mscdex: sridatta: have you seen http://blago.dachev.com/modules ?
[18:47] isaacs: mbrevoor_: but then the registry will send a 301 response.
[18:48] blueadept: why is this function not returning a value? http://www.pastie.org/2280809
[18:48] jonaslund: isaacs: hey, are you moderating nodejs-dev ?
[18:48] isaacs: mbrevoor_: there's no way at this time in the npm client to publish a hyperlink to the registry

[18:49] gaba has joined the channel
[18:50] isaacs: jonaslund: i just let i tthrough
[18:50] mbrevoor_: isaacs: yeah, would be nice if the packages were separate from the registry so a replica registry would be much smaller and could still download public packages from the public registry
[18:50] isaacs: mbrevoor_: yep.
[18:50] jonaslund: ahh
[18:50] isaacs: mbrevoor_: i don't know if there's a way to do that with a replication filter.
[18:50] isaacs: mbrevoor_: it'd be nice, though
[18:51] mscdex: blueadept: you need to pass in a callback that gets executed inside Patient.count()'s callback, with the `count` value 
[18:51] mbrevoor_: isaacs: though that could be an issue for someone using a replica because they dont have outbound network access to the public registry
[18:51] bksf: bump

[18:52] jonaslund: isaacs: in regards to the API help,etc
[18:52] mbrevoor_: isaacs: I also like the idea of having a namespace for packages and in the npm client being able to say for namespace "private" use this registry, otherwise use public... causes lots of trouble for search and the like. similar to what you can do with maven
[18:53] blueadept: mscdex: ah ok, coo, ty!
[18:53] isaacs: hm, yeah, what you really want is to use two registries.
[18:53] isaacs: mbrevoor_: ie, "use this local one first, but if it's not there, then check the public one"
[18:53] isaacs: and collate the search results from both
[18:53] isaacs: it's not trivial.
[18:53] mbrevoor_: isaacs: yeah, that's what I meant by "proxy" earlier
[18:54] isaacs: even if we put redirect docs in the local registry, search still wouldn't know what to do with that
[18:54] Swizec has joined the channel
[18:55] mbrevoor_: isaacs: yup, federate search would be a pisser
[18:56] mbrevoor_: isaacs: but when the number of packages increases by an order of magnitude, replication is going to become more challenging for someone who simply wants to augment the public registry with private packages
[18:57] AvianFlu_ has joined the channel
[18:57] mscdex: bksf: i think the default path for socket.io is '/socket.io' and not '/socket'

[18:58] mscdex: bksf: oh

[19:16] explodes: It says "Could not find any tests to run." in big bold letters
[19:16] jonaslund: bnoordhuis: a slight optimization that could be done is that the byte swap could work as a copy and then remove one of the memcpy's from get/set value
[19:17] bnoordhuis: jonaslund: i suspect there's still a fair bit of cleanup / optimization to be done anyway
[19:17] bnoordhuis: jonaslund: i profiled and benchmarked it yesterday
[19:17] jonaslund: haha yes :)
[19:17] bnoordhuis: jonaslund: it's a sliding scale: the larger the data type, the slower it becomes

[19:21] jonaslund: heh
[19:21] jonaslund: bnoordhuis: try scaling the number of entries depending on the type size then ?
[19:21] jonaslund: bnoordhuis: to avoid caching effects and such
[19:22] bnoordhuis: jonaslund: yep - but it was 5 am by then
[19:22] jonaslund: since apperantly "modern" v8 versions should know how to optimize accesses

[19:49] Charuru: whatever you can afford
[19:49] jewgonewild: 64 or 32 bit?

[19:50] Charuru: the smaller ones 32 the bigger ones 64
[19:50] jewgonewild: Ubuntu 11.04

[23:28] jellosea: whats the difference between writing a string to a stream and a buffer?
[23:29] jellosea: other than the obvious
[23:29] jellosea: that its a buffer lol
[23:29] bradleymeck: string may need to be copied as utf/etc. if its going into Buffer/OS
[23:29] bradleymeck: buffer wont need a copy
[23:30] jbpros has joined the channel
[23:30] boehm has joined the channel
[23:31] bradleymeck: ryah, you got a min about the autodiscovery of ports for servers?
[23:31] jellosea: bradleymeck: so when i'm writing a buffer to the stream - whcih is a connection to a memcache server. i don't get a response back. i'm wiresharking the data and you are right, if i just send the string, it messes up the bytes, the problem is, the server responds even though i send up messed up bytes.. but when i write a buffer to the stream, it just hangs and i don't get a response back from the server
[23:31] bradwright has joined the channel
[23:31] jbrokc: if i have an exec within the callback of another exec, would they loop if the inner one failed?
[23:32] bradleymeck: idk about memcache but the string is being encoded into a buffer at some port

[23:32] mscdex: jbrokc: huh? loop?
[23:32] bradleymeck: some point*
[23:33] mbrevoor_: isaacs: I get this error when I try to replicate over https: "Replication failed: {bad_term,<0.13736.0>}" but over http it seems to have worked... I at least have the design docs now
[23:34] isaacs: hm yeah, i've been doing it all over just http

[23:35] isaacs: mbrevoor_: so i think we're hitting some odd bug in couchdb.  especially since it keeps failing in different ways, judging from the logs
[23:35] jbrokc: what happens is on saving a *.haml file, it will keep compiling it (going through that loop) even though I'm not changing it at all! is this because it fails?

[23:37] jbrokc: i know why - it's because the file is on dropbox and when i save it, dropbox modifies it, then it saves it again, then dropbox modifies it again...
[23:37] isaacs: mbrevoor_: update spidermonkey
[23:37] isaacs: mbrevoor_: or patch it to add the Object.keys shim in more places.
[23:37] isaacs: mbrevoor_: but really, get spidermonkey 1.8
[23:37] jbrokc: nope nevermind, that's not the issue
