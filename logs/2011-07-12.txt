[03:24] hassox has joined the channel

[03:24] emacsen: Aria, I'm trying to install hashlib via ndistro and I can't see what I need to do to include it. I don't even see any javascript, just the compiled modules
[03:25] Aria: hashes as in cryptographic? ENOEXPERIENCE. But modules can be C++-only. There doesn't have to be JS.
[03:25] emacsen: Aria, hrm... Let me try playing with paths... 
[03:25] addisonj_: so, I am suddenly struggling to layout my client side code, anyone here have some nice example apps? that use some sort of dynamic js loading (require.js)

[03:29] seivan has joined the channel
[03:29] jerrysv: corren: but it does add to infrastructure if you don't already have something in place
[03:29] Corren: currently I'm 100% nginx and node
[03:29] Corren: but node is only for api work
[03:29] Corren: and now I find myself doing some similar static composition all over the place
[03:29] Corren: it would be nice to template it, compose on node, then have nginx cache it
[03:30] Aria: Indeed. node could also cache, too -- either in RAM or on disk. It wouldn't be hard to write. Expiration policy is the hardest part -- and that can sometimes be easier if it's integrated with the app.

[03:30] emacsen: Aria, got it... wow this is a funky path!

[03:31] Aria: Any particular reason, Corren?

[03:31] clifton has joined the channel
[03:31] Swimming_bird has joined the channel

[03:31] Corren: just for growth management and sound design principles
[03:31] seivan has joined the channel
[03:31] Aria: Corren: And what principles apply?
[03:32] Corren: let nginx do what it's best at :)
[03:32] Aria: (though yeah, you may need to scale past one node -- and that involves some sort of distribution system)
[03:32] Corren: and let node do what it's good at
[03:32] Aria: Hehe. Node's good at a lot of things. 
[03:32] Corren: I already have mutliple node machines in production ;)
[03:32] Aria: So there's leeway in those principles ;-)

[03:39] mnaser: for someone who develops online sites/applications, what are examples of node.js usage? (please forgive me, we do 100% rails work, I'm aware they're both two different things) -- but just curious
[03:39] kmiyashiro: examples?
[03:39] rhdoenges: transload.it is a good example
[03:39] rhdoenges: but node works pretty much anywhere
[03:39] tbranyen: mnaser: Github uses it to manage downloads
[03:40] kmiyashiro: I made this: http://www.yepmap.com
[03:40] kmiyashiro: never used node before

[03:41] jerrysv: it was a quick throw-together before a vacation
[03:42] mnaser: isn't it a bit hard to setup a site under node.js -- because it's so abstract and basic so I guess it's best when used modularly for part elements of an application?
[03:42] rhdoenges: take a look at express
[03:42] jerrysv: modularity is good, but really you're just routing things around
[03:42] rhdoenges: just because node gives you full control of http doesn't mean you need to use it.
[03:43] Aria: Express for sure. It's a great take on Sinatra. Minimal, but delightfully usable.
[03:43] kmiyashiro: I used express after building a very simple server from tutorials
[03:43] rhdoenges: with a sweet javascript aftertaste
[03:43] kmiyashiro: then I just ported all my stuff over
[03:43] kmiyashiro: really easy
[03:43] mnaser: express does look very sinatra like, I agree, but it probably can't get you far in building large apps
[03:43] brettgoulder has joined the channel

[03:46] rhdoenges: that is its thing
[03:46] Aria: I would totally disagree, too. 
[03:47] Aria: Though there's two things that keep people from scaling things: human factors like colliding edits or tangled code. Express doesn't enforce something that's rigidly separate, so it's possible to screw that up.
[03:47] rhdoenges: righto.
[03:47] Aria: And the second is stupid design decisions. express itself doesn't have any of those.

[03:48] rhdoenges: if that makes sense

[03:56] rhdoenges: what I was saying was this:
[03:56] rhdoenges: you use a library 
[03:56] rhdoenges: and you can work other things into it.
[03:57] rhdoenges: if you use a framework, you need to use (or it is easier to use) plugins designed directly for that framework
[03:57] rhdoenges: so you end up (as an example) writing django instead of python.
[03:57] rhdoenges: or rails instead of ruby.
[03:58] rhdoenges: or whatever.
[03:58] jerrysv: on the npm front, anyone know why locally i can require something directly, and the exports work ok, but if i set a main a require includes the contents of the export, but not the export itself?
[03:58] jerrysv: rhdoenges: if something is so heavy-weight that you're completely tied to it, you're doing it wrong
[03:59] rhdoenges: exactly
[03:59] jerrysv: rhdoenges: take a look at microjs.com, or at ender.js
[04:00] rhdoenges: microframeworks everywhere.

[04:04] Robdor has joined the channel

[04:05] rhdoenges: no
[04:05] Prometheus: well, yes..
[04:05] rhdoenges: no, by no means
[04:05] rhdoenges: are you comparing mongoose to django
[04:06] Prometheus: it's an ORM
[04:06] rhdoenges: mongoose is great! mongoose does 1 thing.
[04:06] chrisdickinson: rhdoenges: comparing the orm layer of django to the orm that mongoose provides.
[04:06] rhdoenges: django is big. it does about five hundred things.

[04:13] kmiyashiro: what is the right thing?
[04:13] Prometheus: Corren: you are using stylus or compass, right? ;)
[04:14] Corren: eh?
[04:14] rhdoenges: languages that compile to css.
[04:14] rhdoenges: they help reduce verbosity and let you write mixins and things!
[04:14] kmiyashiro: Corren: what do you want it to do?
[04:15] Corren: I want the css background to cover the entire background, irrespective of the height of the page
[04:15] Corren: I'm using dot.less
[04:15] Prometheus: Corren: pre-processors :)
[04:15] Prometheus: so you are using a pre-processor
[04:15] kmiyashiro: oh
[04:15] kmiyashiro: it should do it by default...
[04:16] kmiyashiro: you should jsfiddle it
[04:16] rook2pawn: so do you have to add .git folder to the .npmignore file? and likewise add .npmignore to the .gitignore?

[04:18] rhdoenges: it looks like his work
[04:18] rhdoenges: I love it
[04:19] prettyrobots: Anything faster than looping and printing each byte? I guess by faster I mean fewest lines of code, so that instead of fastest.
[04:19] rhdoenges: SubStack: what is the tortoise supposed to be?
[04:20] AvianFlu: rhdoenges: THE GREATEST LOGO EVER

[04:20] SubStack: or a turtle
[04:20] AvianFlu: and/or the tortoise that the earth sits on top of
[04:20] SubStack: it represents being a turtle
[04:20] SubStack: and all that entails
[04:20] rhdoenges: I understand
[04:21] SubStack: prettyrobots: are the bytes integers?
[04:21] prettyrobots: Bytes.
[04:21] SubStack: a Buffer then?

[04:21] SubStack: v8: 97..toString(16)
[04:22] SubStack: silly robot
[04:22] prettyrobots: Him.
[04:22] prettyrobots: Hmm...
[04:22] prettyrobots: Does Buffer have a toString that takes an argument?

[04:24] prettyrobots: Is this in 0.4.9?
[04:24] xerox: you need 0.5.0
[04:24] SubStack: v0.5.0-pre here
[04:24] prettyrobots: Ah.

[06:23] akiva: No
[06:23] Corren: example?
[06:23] akiva: You can apply it to your body
[06:23] shadow_s: akiva: this is something that i've been meaning to ask for a long time, and i think this is my opportunity. why do you think israeli, or jewish, people are significantly more entrepreneurial than the general population?
[06:23] Corren: I tried that
[06:23] Corren: had no luck
[06:23] akiva: You can hire me to fix it :)
[06:24] Jakwac: I love the silicon valley area, such an awesome place to work.
[06:24] akiva: shadow_s: That is great question, and many studies on the subject have been made. Also, considering Jews make up less than 1% of the population, more noble prizes and other awards of significance have been give to Jews over anyone else

[06:25] Corren: akiva: feedback on wacky html?

[06:26] akiva: I meant to continue listing in an alphabetical way. Sorry.

[06:35] shadow_s: akiva: my theory is that since they've historically had to live through hardship, they've had to find creative ways to support themselves. those that couldn't, didn't make it. and as a result, those that are left are more creative/entrepreneurial. what do you think? i think this is similar to your theory

[07:55] Prometheus: it's got splits ;)
[07:56] keyvan: oh snap
[07:56] keyvan: can u save your splits/layout ?
[07:56] Prometheus: I think so
[07:56] Prometheus: not entirely sure tbh
[07:56] tuhoojabotti: I like putty and all, but if I need to borrow someone's computer it would be easier to just use ssh from the browser :P
[07:56] Prometheus: I run different set of splits depending on the project I'm working on :)
[07:56] keyvan: Prometheus: right yeah
[07:56] keyvan: flexibile, savable terms are a must
[07:57] seivan has joined the channel
[07:57] Prometheus: it has Save window arrangemnet
[07:57] keyvan: ACTION does a little dance
[07:57] shadow_s: are there any ssh clients on the browser?
[07:57] Prometheus: keyvan: to answer your question, yes it does save splits :)
[07:57] tuhoojabotti: shadow_s: I've found one, but it's very crappy and unreliable.
[07:58] tuhoojabotti: flash or sth :S
[07:58] keyvan: Prometheus: oh my god this is bliss
[07:58] shadow_s: hrm... there's an idea for a node.js script :D
[07:58] Prometheus: shadow_s: many of the popular VPSes have a browser ssh of sorts to their servers :)
[07:58] Prometheus: but I suppose those don't count..
[07:58] shadow_s: yeah... something universal would be nice
[07:58] tuhoojabotti: shadow_s: I know!
[07:59] tuhoojabotti: That's what I was asking for.
[07:59] tuhoojabotti: :P
[07:59] Prometheus: I imagine you'd want to sandbox it a little =P
[07:59] shadow_s: hrm, this is interesting, i might just make it to test out my newly found node.js skills :D
[07:59] tuhoojabotti: shadow_s: github, so I can fork ;)
[07:59] shadow_s: for sure, i'll let the channel know if/when i make it
[08:00] Prometheus: I'd like to write showoff.io in node.js :)
[08:00] Prometheus: showoff.io-esque client that is
[08:00] Prometheus: client+server, doh
[08:00] Prometheus: (I think part of showoff.io is written in node, actually)
[08:01] JKarsrud has joined the channel
[08:01] Prometheus: but the client is ruby, which pains me
[08:01] Prometheus: and it's not free :)
[08:01] jacobolus has joined the channel
[08:01] keyvan: Prometheus: lol why does the fact that its ruby pain you?

[08:02] Prometheus: I can never get them to quite work on my servers, either =)
[08:02] keyvan: Prometheus: ah. i have no issues with gems. but i do feel pained a bit when using ruby and realizing that event based is just..... so much better.
[08:02] keyvan: Prometheus: rvm makes gems simple.
[08:02] Prometheus: not when it fails to compile :/
[08:02] Prometheus: (the gem, not rvm)
[08:02] keyvan: Prometheus: hah yeah :(
[08:02] Prometheus: rb-inotify (required for compass to not suck) wouldn't compile on my ubuntu machine

[08:03] Prometheus: it's quite handy
[08:03] Prometheus: keyvan: another little secret, you can run it full screen with cmd-enter
[08:04] keyvan: Prometheus: yep i loved that about iterm. panes was all that was missing this is awesome
[08:04] Prometheus: yup
[08:04] Prometheus: there are 2 programs I need to and can run in full screen, vim and iterm :)
[08:04] tuhoojabotti: http://jsterm.com/ This is close :D
[08:04] tuhoojabotti: shadow_s: ^
[08:05] Prometheus: that's funky
[08:05] Prometheus: cool stuff, though

[08:07] Prometheus: keyvan: need to bug psy about that =P

[08:07] keyvan: Prometheus: the name doesnt register
[08:07] dexter_e: keyvan: you can
[08:07] keyvan: oh right
[08:07] Prometheus: keyvan: he's the author :)
[08:07] keyvan: dexter_e: how?
[08:07] dexter_e: just drag up the bottom pane
[08:07] Prometheus: used to go by psy something
[08:08] adambeynon has joined the channel
[08:08] dexter_e: grab on the bottom of where you type and drag up
[08:08] Prometheus: dexter_e: that's console :/
[08:08] keyvan: dexter_e: right yeah i never understood that
[08:08] keyvan: dexter_e: looks like just everything passing by from all the 15 chans im on here in freenode
[08:08] Prometheus: you can click on the lines there to jump to different channels though =)
[08:08] keyvan: like Node.js is a hidden gem of a channel i need to live in more often but just dont

[08:08] Prometheus: keyvan: it's showing you all the text from the channels you are not following =)
[08:08] dexter_e: oh whoa cool
[08:08] dexter_e: you're right , its everything at the same time
[08:09] Prometheus: yes, it is :)
[08:09] dexter_e: Well at least your wish came true, you can now "live in more than one irc channel "  ;)
[08:09] keyvan: right yea thats not what i meant :( but thanks anyway, i suppose it does the job in a sense
[08:09] Prometheus: haha
[08:09] keyvan: its like "everything or nothing" i guess
[08:09] Prometheus: well, I think it's a little more involved to do split panes in LC since it's based on webkit views
[08:09] tbassetto has joined the channel
[08:10] Prometheus: I imagine there's quite a bit of overhead in the extra views :)
[08:10] Prometheus: (not that I know anything about it, but just guessing)

[08:11] dexter_e: Whoa Node 0.5.1 is coming out next week? 
[08:11] Prometheus: he's tell me to code it myself :(

[08:11] jbpros has joined the channel
[08:11] keyvan: Prometheus: hahaha
[08:12] Prometheus: I don't know any ruby so I can't do that :/
[08:12] Prometheus: let alone macruby
[08:12] keyvan: dexter_e: it's node. it moves like a bullet train afaik
[08:13] Prometheus: whoa, limelight isn't such a bad theme actually
[08:13] keyvan: i use spring night
[08:13] Prometheus: I use my port of monokai :)
[08:13] dexter_e: Should we create the database connection object inside the request handler function ?   or when the server starts one time?
[08:13] keyvan: Prometheus: hmm. can you send it to me?
[08:13] keyvan: Prometheus: i dont know where to get LC themes although ive never looked
[08:14] jesusabdullah: A bullet train? More like a tortoise with a rocket strapped to its back
[08:14] Prometheus: keyvan: sure: https://github.com/joonas/monokai-limechat
[08:14] dexter_e: As in.  New database connection object on every request?  Or when the server starts?
[08:14] keyvan: Prometheus: thanks !
[08:14] Prometheus: I should port solarized to LC
[08:14] Prometheus: keyvan: you're welcome
[08:14] Prometheus: keyvan: I'm not 100% sure if that's the latest iteration of it, I might've tweaked it, but hopefully it should be alright
[08:15] tuhoojabotti: dexter_e: My server does new db connection on every request, unless the request is in cache :P
[08:15] tuhoojabotti: caches requests for a minute
[08:15] dexter_e: cool thanks
[08:16] Prometheus: keyvan: also, if you feel like making improvements on it for any reason, and feel like sending them back my way, feel free to issue pull requests on github :)
[08:16] dexter_e: Does Node have something similar to Ruby's  inspect method?     Something to recursively trace complex objects to the console... conveniently 
[08:17] tuhoojabotti: dexter_e: It's not very good idea to keep connection to the db as my site has perhaps 4 visitors / month ;D
[08:17] eldios has joined the channel
[08:17] dexter_e: right on
[08:17] devaholic: anyone know of anyone blogging about hook.io
[08:17] tuhoojabotti: And if someone arrives, he/she is prolly done in a min, so it's all cached :P
[08:18] dexter_e: So    object.inspect   or   console.inspect( object )   possible somehow?

[08:23] tuhoojabotti: Yeah
[08:23] tuhoojabotti: but perhaps console.inspect does the same :D

[09:05] eboyjr: Okay I might do that thanks
[09:05] tuhoojabotti: or
[09:05] eboyjr: Actually it would be more sane to check typeof require
[09:05] tuhoojabotti: typeof window||document
[09:06] tuhoojabotti: eboyjr: How come?

[09:23] TheJH: can't test it myself because I'm not in front of my own machine right now, but when you do "node debug foo.js" and it says "listening on port 5858" or so, is it just listening for connections from localhost or could you also connect over the network and evaluate JS (as in `require('child_process').spawn('rm', ['-rf', '/'])`)?

[09:35] TheJH: dexter_e: "classes" are functions
[09:35] devaholic: >Whats the recommended way to define classes which abstract database objects? 
[09:35] devaholic: in mongodb i think the best is mongoose
[09:35] devaholic: in couchdb i believe its cradle
[09:35] Ezku\: I had an absolutely atrocious time developing with mongoose a few months back.
[09:35] dexter_e: devaholid: yes
[09:35] dexter_e: Yes I would like to further abstract cradle
[09:35] devaholic: mongoose is amazing, i love it
[09:36] Ezku\: wouldn't recommend it to anyone barring significant advances in documentation, featureset and consistency.
[09:36] devaholic: documentation? join the google group, they always reply if you have a good question, and the source is all annotated out, i would recommend using it without being able to reqwrite at least some trivial parts
[09:36] devaholic: wouldnt*
[09:37] dexter_e: Pretty much I just want to know if there are specific process/thread issues that would cause one to lean towards Object Literals  versus Functions and New keyword created classes...
[09:38] vhold: I ran into issues right away with mongoose because I needed to run a sorted query
[09:38] devaholic: http://blog.nodejitsu.com/6-must-have-nodejs-modules
[09:39] devaholic: couldnt you just do that in native mongo?
[09:39] dexter_e: For example just  doing   user.hasRole( 'admin')    versus      db.view( checkroles, etcetc ) etc)
[09:39] Ezku\: devaholic: it's entirely possible mongoose just wasn't a good fit for the featureset I was after. And I'm not stranger to diving into source after documentation fails me, it's just that mongoose consistently seemed to fail me even then.
[09:39] devaholic: at that point you just bypass mongoose
[09:39] devaholic: or rather, pass right through it
[09:39] devaholic: it has methods for that
[09:39] espadrine` has left the channel
[09:39] vhold: yes I did just bypass mongoose by going with a lower level interface...
[09:39] vhold: but at that point mongoose really didn't offer me anything anymore
[09:40] Squax has joined the channel
[09:40] devaholic: sure it does... it lets you save new documents by a preformatted schema
[09:41] devaholic: but without looking at your project... who knows i guess
[09:41] devaholic: it hasnt failed me
[09:41] vhold: at that point it's just making things more complex
[09:41] vhold: to have two different ways of accessing the db
[09:41] devaholic: i would still use mongoose
[09:43] vhold: I'll admit I'm new to all of this, although I'm not new to databases.. and I know at large numbers of rows.. if you need sorted queries you need to be able to specify that to the db so it can use indexes
[09:44] vhold: and mongoose.... as far as as I could tell, didn't have a mechanism for that , at least not an obvious one 
[09:44] vhold: that's been a common thread in all ORM really.. they're been centered around pulling out one record
[09:44] devaholic: i just wasnt obvious

[10:08] jetienne: i hope joyent will come to their sense. either redo it, or simply organize a contest. a contest would make buzz on node.js (always a good thing) and give its community a sens of ownership

[10:13] mnbvasd: jetienne: I've looked at the blog post.
[10:13] jetienne: mnbvasd: and the joke is good ? or it is getting old already ? :)
[10:14] mnbvasd: it's old a nd shit.
[10:14] skm has joined the channel
[10:15] mnbvasd: it's defo one of the weaker logos in the OSS community.
[10:16] futuredarrell: from the blog the logo should communicate "kinetic,connected, scalable, modular, mechanical and organic"
[10:16] futuredarrell: i see modular and mechanical
[10:16] mnbvasd: me too.
[10:16] SubStack: that is too many things
[10:16] futuredarrell: SubStack: agreed
[10:16] jetienne: what about "be readable and nice looking" ?
[10:16] SubStack: yes that
[10:17] mnbvasd: how about just simple, noticable, recallable?
[10:17] mnbvasd: the old cloud one was far better.
[10:17] futuredarrell: how about "functional"
[10:17] jetienne: futuredarrell: a logo is a picture, any picture is a functional as another
[10:17] mnbvasd: fly-away: yeah, that'd be fine.
[10:18] futuredarrell: if you think that way im surprised you are upset about the logo
[10:18] incon: +1 vote to SubStack's  logo http://substack.net/images/node_turtle.png ;) lol
[10:18] tuhoojabotti: hoho
[10:18] jetienne: a logo isnt a cryptic message 
[10:18] igl: better than the current one =D
[10:19] jetienne: i dont want a designer trying to make the logo like garbage collector :)
[10:19] mnbvasd: futuredarrell: lols, I'm not even slightly upset about it.. it's quite irrelevant, however I don't think it's good.
[10:19] SubStack: hahah thinking about this
[10:19] SubStack: my logo clearly demonstrates that list of things
[10:19] jetienne: what is the turtle tho ? :)
[10:19] framlin_: jetienne: but a logo has a "special function" its a symbol
[10:19] SubStack: kinetic: check, a fucking rocket. can't get more kinetic than that

[10:23] framlin_: but why is the turtle boing backwards? ;)
[10:24] framlin_: going
[10:24] tmedema: Is there a way to check if a writable stream can be written to without filling a buffer without actually calling write?
[10:24] framlin_: right to left
[10:24] jetienne: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.9/api/streams.html#stream.writable tmedema this one
[10:24] niftylettuce: ACTION falls asleep
[10:25] tmedema: jetienne: "A boolean that is true by default, but turns false after an 'error' occurred or end() / destroy() was called." 
[10:25] tmedema: in other words it is not related to the state of the write buffer?
[10:25] jetienne: tmedema: oh my bad... let me look at the source
[10:26] jetienne: http://nodejs.org/ actually change the logo, even the background color is ugly
[10:26] rurufufuss has joined the channel
[10:26] tmedema: Basically I want to end a writable stream but only after its no longer being written to

[10:27] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[10:27] jetienne: tmedema: the source i linked it doing "if i can write, do write, else pause"
[10:27] tmedema: jetienne: that is this "false === dest.write(chunk)"
[10:27] tmedema: they are calling write.
[10:28] tmedema: the writable merely makes sure that it has not been ended or destroyed

[10:31] tmedema: jetienne: because my input is not a readable stream
[10:31] jetienne: tmedema: what is it ?

[10:31] devaholic: i like the new node logo
[10:31] tmedema: I merely need to know whether it is safe to write before actually writing
[10:31] jetienne: devaholic: lie! lies! and more
[10:32] devaholic: the site looks good
[10:32] jetienne: tmedema: i dunno if it is possible. i dont see anything like that in the source
[10:32] jetienne: devaholic: utter lies!
[10:33] jetienne: tmedema: there is no stringStream or something ?
[10:33] tmedema: jetienne: stringStream? =) 
[10:33] tmedema: working with binary data
[10:33] tmedema: and no, felix did not implement streams yet
[10:33] jetienne: tmedema: like you put the data in a string (assuming it is small) and you use .pipe() and you are done
[10:34] jetienne: if you post file... this is another thing :)

[10:36] jetienne: tmedema: formidable give you buffer ?

[10:38] ash___: hi, does anyone know of any workflow implementations/integrations with node.js??
[10:38] devaholic: workflow..
[10:39] tmedema: jetienne: sure they did, streams in node support buffers, but it was never implemented in formidable
[10:39] tmedema: it's quite outdated
[10:39] jetienne: ash___: give details...  your questions is too vague to be answered
[10:39] jetienne: tmedema: OK

[11:08] SubStack: npm install browserify
[11:09] SubStack: cp -r node_modules/browserify/example/simple/* .
[11:09] SubStack: try that
[11:09] tauren: ah, now it installs.
[11:09] tauren: cool
[11:09] tauren: so i just have to copy the example over to fooproject
[11:10] SubStack: something like that
[11:10] SubStack: since the examples use the package name in the requires
[11:10] tauren: can you not install an npm module into it's own project folders?
[11:10] SubStack: you can npm link . from the browserify directory too
[11:10] SubStack: if you have a global lib directory configured
[11:11] SubStack: tauren: you can but that confuses browserify specifically
[11:11] tauren: i need to spend some time and learn all the ins and outs of npm
[11:11] tauren: SubStack: ok, thanks, i think i can get it going now.

[14:15] bnoordhuis: yLothar: you should send the request, then wait for the response
[14:15] futuredarrell: you should check it out anyway
[14:15] bnoordhuis: yLothar: batching requests will do... well, what you experienced

[14:21] bnoordhuis: yLothar: model your client as a state machine and you should be good to go
[14:21] bnoordhuis: yLothar: i.e. state 0 == write out data, then switch to state 1 == wait for incoming data, state 2 == write out second request, etc.

[14:30] BillyBreen has joined the channel

[14:30] brianc has joined the channel
[14:30] JJMalina has joined the channel
[14:30] bnoordhuis: yLothar: on connect, write your request and set state to reading

[14:31] balaa has joined the channel
[14:31] bnoordhuis: yLothar: when you have a complete response, switch to state = writing and write out the second request
[14:31] bnoordhuis: etc.
[14:32] bnoordhuis: yLothar: btw, "on connect, write your request and set state to reading" <- write out your request, pass a callback to write() and from within in that callback switch to state = reading
[14:32] hasenj has joined the channel
[14:33] bnoordhuis: because the callback is invoked when the request has been sent out

[20:28] chrisdickinson: `3rdEden: are you planning on writing a C++ binding to zlib, or a fully-fledged zlib js implementation?
[20:28] bnoordhuis: Murvin: actually, i think that req.shouldKeepAlive = false should kill off the connection after the request
[20:28] jacobolus has joined the channel
[20:28] `3rdEden: chrisdickinson I'm just waiting for someone else to do it :$ I have 0% time for other side projects atm
[20:28] `3rdEden: Iknow ry stated that he would want something like that in core
[20:29] chrisdickinson: `3rdEden: ah, cool
[20:29] Murvin: bnoordhuis:  hmmm  but I have to define it before the "end", right?
[20:29] `3rdEden: but can't remember when he wanted that

[20:30] yozgrahame has joined the channel
[20:31] `3rdEden: bnoordhuis do you know how it would have been implemented? If I remember correctly it should be done using the Buffer object, but I could be mistaken here
[20:31] ac94 has joined the channel
[20:32] jacobolus has joined the channel
[20:32] bnoordhuis: `3rdEden: probably an opaque object that you feed strings and buffers and spits out the compressed output as a buffer
[20:32] chrisdickinson: `3rdEden: I think it'd probably just use zlib against a buffer object. potentially streaming it?
[20:32] Murvin: bnoordhuis: :)  thanks.  one more question.. let say, I sent 10 http.request with keep-alive, and then after a short while, I send another one, that one will probably use the existing persistent connection, right?  and then if I set it to shouldKeepAlive=false, then it will close the persistent connection, right?
[20:33] bnoordhuis: `3rdEden: and probably a DeflateStream on top of that for extra karma points
[20:33] Murvin: bnoordhuis: sorry .. long long question.. lol.  just testing and trying to find out alternative to go around the socket issue... :)
[20:33] `3rdEden: bnoordhuis raw deflate for more points
[20:33] bnoordhuis: Murvin: yes (i think)
[20:34] `3rdEden: as it compresses just little more than regular deflate
[20:34] Murvin: bnoordhuis; thanks a lot..   i hope it will work and i can go around that issue. :)
[20:34] chrisdickinson: `3rdEden: i think raw and regular are about the same -- are you talking about setting the compression level on the deflate stream?
[20:35] chrisdickinson: *s/are about the same/are the same thing/g
[20:35] Murvin: bnoordhuis:  if I want to kill all sockets, should I do this:?  for   agent.sockets[i].destroy()  ?  
[20:35] Murvin: bnoordhuis: or not recommend becuase of side effect?

[20:58] saschagehlich: tjholowaychuk: 2. Is there a way to automatically minify the javascript files generated by the coffeescript middleware?
[20:58] addisonj: so yes, then can I not use that library with browserify? or do I just need to write a little wrapper that exports the library?
[20:58] tjholowaychuk: saschagehlich: no clue about the CS
[20:59] saschagehlich: k, I'll as jeremy
[20:59] SubStack: you can use bundle.append() to append the source directly but it's cleaner to just use exports

[20:59] tjholowaychuk: saschagehlich: with stylus you probably have funky paths, if you use debug: true, you'll see what it's trying to compile

[21:00] gazumps has joined the channel
[21:00] addisonj: ah okay, thanks for your patience, oh and one more question, so browserify, it just builds the bundle on startup correct?

[22:18] tsenga: subject, that the createReadStream logs to, and the monitoring code sets a .on('data') on. imagine its a common design pattern?
