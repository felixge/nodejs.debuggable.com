[00:05] TheAlphaNerd: I want to use node.js + socket.io to create a very simple UI

[00:05] TheAlphaNerd: and I want those ui elements to send osc messages to max/msp
[00:05] TheAlphaNerd: or pure/data
[00:05] WarheadsSE: so backbone + express + socket.io + udp
[00:06] WarheadsSE: button makes a socket.io emit, server app translates that into udp command, and sends it off

[02:14] KingInky: all i can think to do is use IPs to store sessions and have the sessions wipe clean every few minutes, but this would mean that two people on one network couldn't use the application at the same time.
[02:14] francisl has joined the channel
[02:14] KingInky: the other idea i had is to use cookies, but i dunno if that would work right.
[02:14] WarheadsSE: KingInky: sessions in the cookie, via connect ?
[02:15] TheEmpath: KingInky: I believe socket.io comes with support for redis to register a session id server side
[02:15] TheEmpath: and by default, it has a cookie... but its been a while
[02:15] KingInky: haha TheEmpath: we are in node.js and socket.io channels together lol
[02:15] TheEmpath: I am everywhere!
[02:15] WarheadsSE: we're just using an in-memory store.
[02:16] KingInky: thanks for an actual answer. i'll look into redis, i used it once, and i liked it because it has publish/subscribe
[02:16] lukeholder has joined the channel
[02:16] KingInky: Warhead: yes, i think cookies would work, but i dunno how ot use them in socket.io
[02:16] KingInky: like, just give every client a unique cookie session
[02:16] lukeholder: Does anyone know a was to edit SWF files with node.js?
[02:16] KingInky: and read that in socket.io
[02:16] torvalamo: there's no need for socket.io to use anything other than a plain js object to store sessid->socket pairs
[02:16] WarheadsSE: hmm let me find the example..
[02:16] WarheadsSE: (its in the archlinuxarm/plugbuild-ui server.js)
[02:17] lukeholder: Im looking for a swf manipulation library in node.js
[02:17] KingInky: Warhead: you have examples of this??! that's awesome

[02:24] KingInky: could you google it, or is it something too uncommon?
[02:25] KingInky: i just tried googling it myself, got basically no results. what in the world is cloudant anyhow?
[02:25] WarheadsSE: facebook.. it is odd ... ?

[02:38] KingInky: warhead: what'd u write it in bro?
[02:38] KingInky: php?
[02:38] WarheadsSE: no, the site is php, but the game/server are c++
[02:38] WarheadsSE: it's not a webpage based game
[02:38] KingInky: yeah that's why i asked cause i saw the "current versions" box

[03:10] sammmy: isaacs: why doesn't fs.mkdir have this functionality? :\
[03:10] context: forms are difficult ?
[03:10] Es0teric: context no… whats the command for forms
[03:11] ljharb: <form> ?
[03:11] Es0teric: and nesting input fields in forms
[03:11] context: what ljharb said
[03:11] ljharb: <form><input /></form>
[03:11] Es0teric: dude
[03:11] Es0teric: i am using Jade

[03:11] context: how do I put shit in the trunk of my car?
[03:11] Es0teric: but i want dynamic content

[03:11] Es0teric: and i go status huh?

[03:12] Es0teric: no i am not trying to dynamically generate a form
[03:12] sammmy: isaacs: userland?

[03:13] Es0teric: context i am using express
[03:13] Es0teric: ;|

[03:13] context: well you figured out half the problem
[03:13] ljharb: Es0teric: you can change the template engine you want in express on both a global basis and per-render.
[03:14] context: you should be able to figure it out from there
[03:14] Es0teric: ljharb i want a global basis
[03:14] Es0teric: i just want to
[03:14] Es0teric: generate a form so i can send POST data

[03:43] Es0teric: right?
[03:44] Es0teric: ljharb

[03:45] Es0teric: ljharb ^
[03:46] hh__: dont use the view engine middleware
[03:46] hh__: resorts to using static files though
[03:46] hh__: or write your own middleware/template engine
[03:46] Es0teric: hh__
[03:47] Es0teric: then what should i do?
[03:47] Es0teric: i just want raw html
[03:47] Es0teric: because this template engine shit aint for me
[03:47] Es0teric: lol
[03:47] ljharb: if you have a file extension when you render the files, it bypasses it. try just rendering index.html
[03:48] Es0teric: ljharb Cannot GET /index.html
[03:48] hh__: you put it in public/ 
[03:48] hh__: by default thats where the static middleware serves/looks
[03:49] Es0teric: hh__ ok, so then how do i make the default directory that?
[03:49] hh__: what do you mean?
[03:49] Es0teric: i want the default directory to be public/ then
[03:49] Es0teric: because right now its looking in views/
[03:49] Es0teric: so if i do local.host:3000/
[03:49] Es0teric: i want it to load the index from public/
[03:50] Es0teric: hh__ is it app.set('public', __dirname + '/public'); <-- ?
[03:51] eventualbuddha has joined the channel
[03:51] hh__: uh i dont know on the top of my head, imean you can try changing the path

[04:34] Aria: Okay...
[04:34] Es0teric: and it didnt work
[04:34] ljharb: since it should work in 3 lines of code, i can safely say you did something wrong
[04:34] Es0teric: also, it was a pain to just get raw html

[04:35] Es0teric: ljharb the public directory is already there

[04:35] Es0teric: when i do local.host:3000/

[04:41] Es0teric: when i create a web server in a js file lets say
[04:42] Es0teric: how do i make it render what i write on it?
[04:42] Es0teric: how do i get the page of it up
[04:42] chapel: js is not php
[04:42] Es0teric: i know that
[04:42] chapel: res.send('<html></html>')
[04:42] Es0teric: you're kidding me right?
[04:43] ljharb: gah. Es0teric if you use the public folder, you can render static html easily. if you want to pass variables in, you either need a templating engine, or res.send raw html.
[04:43] Es0teric: --_--
[04:43] Es0teric: so thats the kicker
[04:43] ljharb: that's how php works too.
[04:43] Es0teric: you need a templating engine
[04:43] Es0teric: to get dynamic js
[04:43] Es0teric: jade sucks ass
[04:43] chapel: you can use ejs
[04:43] chapel: or haml
[04:43] chapel: or mustache

[04:52] Es0teric: ljharb how do you…ok lets say i want to create a simple web server right? where would i put the js file for it AND how do i pass what i want to the view from there?
[04:52] rlidwka: IE7 then... there are IEs for all of you xD
[04:53] ljharb: Es0teric: make an app.js or server.js or whatever. use express, start a server. set the view engine to ejs or whatever. then make a file in views like "index.ejs". when that's working, i'll give you a line of code to pass in variables.
[04:53] Es0teric: ljharb oh ok done
[04:57] sammmy: How do I res.redirect in express and remove the browser history item?
[04:58] ljharb: sammmy: you can't remove the browser history item, except in modern browsers with client-side JS using history.replace
[04:58] ljharb: nor should you want to, because that screws with the user's browser. it's not nice.
[04:59] langworthy has joined the channel
[04:59] sammmy: ljharb: That's not the case. I know there has to be a proper HTTP redirect code or something that will tell the browser not to create a new history item.
[05:00] ljharb: nope, there's not
[05:00] ljharb: a 301 redirect says "permanently replace the old url with the new one" but browsers usually don't update their bookmarks to respect it
[05:00] ljharb: a 301 is the best response. but if it redirects, who cares about the history item?

[06:17] Es0teric: do i put that on a .js?
[06:17] ljharb: Es0teric: you put that in your app.get handler.
[06:17] ljharb: sammmy: i'm also using something called passport, so maybe that is handling the cookie for me

[06:24] ljharb: haha you made a fibonacci server

[06:24] dshaw_: yeah, worse
[06:24] AvianFlu: I made a C++ addon that does the fibonacci computation
[06:25] Es0teric: ljharb i plan on extending the client further.. but for now i just want the basics to get used to this streaming data thing
[06:25] TheEmpath3: fibonacci - the web's most vital function
[06:25] TheEmpath3: using the built-in cluster with node.js on more than one core causes socket.io to spam "warn - client not handshaken client should reconnect"... ugh...
[06:25] AvianFlu: it's just turned into such a great troll algorithm
[06:25] ljharb: Es0teric: gotcha. then you'll have to initiate the stream, and listen for the chunks that come from it. i don't know much about streams.
[06:26] Es0teric: well, i have a node module specifically made for twitter streams...
[06:26] Es0teric: i just have to know how to connect to the stream and output the data i want

[09:24] yawNO: lol
[09:24] maritz: why don't you just got to your garden and get some carrots from there? (the root is the edible part that contains the beta-carrotins after all)

[09:29] yawNO: the dark side in you rising is

[09:29] zackattack: oh.
[09:29] zackattack: i'm using 2.5.8
[09:29] zackattack: why does it say v3 on github?
[09:30] zackattack: Express 3.x (master branch) is compatible with node 0.6.x and connect 2.x
[09:30] yawNO:  its main branch
[09:30] wingie has joined the channel

[09:31] zackattack: yawNO:  once i clone the github repo, how do i include the 3.x branch in my app?
[09:31] yawNO: :>
[09:32] yawNO: zackattack: that _is_ the 3.x version
[09:32] maritz: zackattack: if looking for the latest version either look at the npm versions (npm view express) or the tags on github. the package.json in the master branch is the one that is still being developed
[09:32] zackattack: ....but how do i force my app to include *that* version, instead of the one i installed in npm?
[09:32] yawNO: use that and you should be good to go
[09:32] yawNO: zackattack: git checkout locally and use
[09:32] zackattack: where do i put it ?  node_modules ?
[09:33] yawNO: var express = require('/path');
[09:33] maritz: zackattack: uninstall the npm version and remove it from your package.json as a depdendency. if that is REALLY what you want. however 3.x is not stable and not released!
[09:33] zackattack: maritz:  i can't set cookies with the version i have.
[09:33] maritz: why not?
[09:33] yawNO: maritz: its bette to leave the version on npm
[09:33] yawNO: and use it locally imho
[09:33] maritz: why if he's not using it?
[09:33] zackattack: maritz:  i have no clue, but the server seems to be ignoring my writes

[09:34] yawNO: doesnt express use res.session w/ cookies?
[09:35] maritz: yawNO: because npm install express is such a pain? honestly the danger of accidentally including the wrong version somewhere if you have 2 is too much of a downside imo
[09:35] yawNO:  req.session
[09:35] zackattack: do i need to include a session store in order to use cookies?
[09:35] maritz: i don't think so
[09:35] yawNO: i thought it was req.session 
[09:35] yawNO: not res.session
[09:35] maritz: but you do need the cookieParser
[09:35] hh__: http://search.npmjs.org/#/couch <--- what's the github for this
[09:35] zackattack: i do have cookie parser
[09:35] yawNO: amirite?
[09:35] maritz: yawNO: he's not talking about sessions, shut up :P
[09:35] yawNO: same
[09:36] yawNO: req.cookie
[09:36] yawNO: not res.cookie
[09:36] yawNO: or am i wrong?
[09:36] maritz: http://expressjs.com/guide.html#res.cookie()
[09:36] maritz: yes you are
[09:36] yawNO: havent used express for quite a while

[09:37] jetienne_ has joined the channel
[09:37] maritz: so, what does the browser get as response headers?
[09:37] zackattack: res.cookie is for writing.
[09:37] maritz: zackattack: 
[09:37] zackattack: maritz:  how can i see the response headers in chrome? 
[09:37] maritz: in the chrome webdev tools network tab?!
[09:37] maritz: how do you know they're not being written? 
[09:38] zackattack: because i inspect document.cookie

[09:42] hellp has joined the channel
[09:43] zackattack: maritz:  i finally found the bug!
[09:43] zackattack: maritz:  it's because i was doing a res.redirect() before I did a res.render() .....
[09:43] zackattack: so it ignored all the cookies i was writing.
[09:43] zackattack: ACTION augh
[09:44] maritz: that'd do it :D
[09:44] diogogmt has joined the channel
[09:44] thqloz has joined the channel
[09:44] maritz: although i'm not sure if redirect shouldn't write the cookie as well, maybe that's worth a bug report? (not sure if it's allowed to send cookies on 30x responses though)
[09:45] mike has joined the channel
[09:45] zackattack: okay... still not working.
[09:46] jimmysparkle has joined the channel
[09:47] maritz: yeah, looking at the code, res.redirect should write the headers anyways, so that can't be it.
[09:48] herbySk has joined the channel
[09:48] zackattack: you're looking at the express code?
[09:48] maritz: possible problems: you set httpOnly: true, the maxAge is too short, your document.cookie check is wrong (use chrome webdev tools resource tab to check for cookies instead)
[09:48] maritz: yes

[09:49] zackattack: What cookie() method will delete them at all costs?
[09:50] zackattack: the domain is blank in chrome webdev
[09:50] maritz: from the server? set maxAge to 1
[09:50] maritz: domain is blank? what does that even mean?
[09:51] zackattack:           res.cookie('bb_sessionhash', '', { maxAge: 1});
[09:51] zackattack: like that?

[13:55] WarheadsSE: shiva__: howtonode , nodebeginner
[13:56] forste: WarheadsSE: thanks but I meant something like an API for the underlying language itself (e.g. specific documentation for Array.bind)
[13:56] WarheadsSE: ah... v8
[13:56] WarheadsSE: nodejs is just JS w/ some libs, eventing, etc.

[13:57] shiva__: anyone using node.js now..
[13:57] WarheadsSE: i mentioned using memroy store

[13:59] savudin: shiva__ just went trough it myselfe
[13:59] KingInky: kk. i feel like i should be pretty clear though. i don't want to use sessions that come from express or connect or the like. what i'm trying to do is write a little client for my website that will allow me to chat back and forth with guests on my website.
[13:59] carlyle has joined the channel
[13:59] WarheadsSE: ok
[13:59] shiva__: oh sorry.. this is the first time using this site..
[13:59] KingInky: and this chat client needs to be persistent across page changes. so if they go to a new page i need their conversation to be in tact.
[13:59] shiva__: thanks for all..
[14:00] KingInky: that's why it's so difficult. if i did a popup window itd be easy, but i want it to work across the whole site.
[14:00] WarheadsSE: KingInky: ahm.. yeah that will be interesting to implement without storage..
[14:00] KingInky: totally, man. it's going to be quite the undertaking but i just need a solid strategy as to how to go about it
[14:00] KingInky: that's where im having trouble.
[14:00] WarheadsSE: hmm
[14:01] WarheadsSE: i still say session + persistent storage..
[14:01] KingInky: the thing is is when someone leaves page 1 and goes to page 2, their socket is going to be closed and re-opened.
[14:01] shiva__: please give ur mail id's.. if i struck in node.js , i will contact u..
[14:01] KingInky: so someone i have to keep track of who's who
[14:01] panchot has joined the channel
[14:01] WarheadsSE: yes, and there is where the session comes in
[14:01] savudin: shiva__ :)
[14:01] zzen has joined the channel
[14:01] shiva__: tell me savudin
[14:01] WarheadsSE: store their conversation in the session info (via whatever means) and pass the content back and forth via JSON
[14:02] KingInky: didn't think about JSON
[14:02] WarheadsSE: shiva__: you'll find us here.
[14:02] savudin: exactely
[14:02] shiva__: @warheadssE
[14:02] shiva__:  u have any sample projects
[14:02] shiva__: using node.js
[14:02] KingInky: warheads: cool man. i just need to find out how to uniquely identify people. any ideas there? (thanks for all the help btw)

[14:25] benvie: but has some cavaets
[14:26] benvie: actually no that's wrong

[14:28] benvie: in case you wanted to use the api now or something

[14:28] benvie: and how you specify endianness is different
[14:28] benvie: not difficult just a bit of annoying
[14:29] benvie: nope check it
[14:29] benvie: the arraybuffer's buffer property is the buffer you gave it

[15:11] baudehlo: I hate when they split programming languages into runtime and "dev" stuff.
[15:12] larsschenk has joined the channel
[15:12] diverdude: baudehlo: nah i think its okay actually
[15:12] baudehlo: it seems so bloody retarded.
[15:12] benvie: and yeah
[15:12] diverdude: baudehlo: often ppl dont need the dev stuff so why have it
[15:12] baudehlo: I think you just discovered why have it.
[15:12] quinnirill: benvie: no, actually, I now have a Buffer and I'm trying to make it an argument for a function call, and the argv is a Local<Value> array
[15:13] benvie: oooh no so
[15:13] diverdude: baudehlo: because i need the dev stuff does not mean everybody does
[15:13] benvie: what the code is doing is creating a function in javascript
[15:13] benvie: you will give the buffer from js itself
[15:13] Swizec has joined the channel
[15:13] baudehlo: right, but "npm install" is stunted without it. So maybe they should get rid of npm too?
[15:13] benvie: Address will be called directly from JS
[15:13] diverdude: baudehlo: in general i think it would be lame to install dev stuff for all programs i use even though i will never develop for it
[15:14] baudehlo: meh. Disk is cheap.
[15:14] isaacs: what is it that npm install is stunted without?
[15:14] isaacs: i'm confused.
[15:14] diverdude: its a waste of harddiskspace, time and bandwidth
[15:14] baudehlo: isaacs: node-waf
[15:14] isaacs: oh, yeah.  that's going away.
[15:14] isaacs: but not quickly
[15:14] benvie: so when you compile this little module he made
[15:14] quinnirill: benvie: hmm, yeah, but I'm not trying to do the same thing Address is, actually ^^ well, nvm
[15:14] benvie: you are, yuo have it in reverse =D
[15:15] benvie: this is where you get the buffer from
[15:15] karterk has joined the channel
[15:15] benvie: and you'll tie it from Address to your own stuff
[15:15] isaacs: the path forward is using declarative compilation directives in a a gyp file
[15:15] benvie: you assume the buffer is provided
[15:15] benvie: so what will happen is
[15:15] diverdude: baudehlo: nope....but they have a convention of splitting dev and user stufff...so why make exceptions to that conventions...then things starts to get really confusing
[15:15] benvie: this compiles to a .node file
[15:15] benvie: you require it from node in js
[15:15] Shrink has joined the channel
[15:15] benvie: then you'll have the function 'address' in jss
[15:15] baudehlo: diverdude: oh I know they do it for all languages. It's super annoying in the Perl world too.
[15:15] benvie: address(new Buffer(50))
[15:15] isaacs: npm IS node-dev
[15:16] baudehlo: there's been many debates about this on perl5-porters.
[15:16] benvie: viola buffer in C
[15:16] benvie: C++
[15:16] benvie: er address to it anyway
[15:16] k1ttty has joined the channel
[15:16] benvie: the code there has it returning the address to js but you can do whatever
[15:16] savudin: can i write coffeescript and still use all modules normaly in node?
[15:16] isaacs: there's a node::Buffer class you can use in C++.  but really, it's better for c++ code to not have that much node-ism in it, and instead just talk to libuv.  take a buffer as an argument from JS, write to it/read from it/whatever, call the cb to say you'er done.
[15:17] isaacs: it's much simpler that way
[15:17] flou has joined the channel
[15:17] benvie: not sure what he's doing, but this was a neat thing Nate made
[15:17] isaacs: and it leaves the door open for optimizations in the buffer implementation at the JS level, or slab allocators, and so on.
[15:17] benvie: to get the memory address inside JS for use in ffi
[15:17] isaacs: savudin: sort of.  i mean, you have to wear a funny hat.
[15:17] isaacs: savudin: but other than that, yes.
[15:17] benvie: so you could have stuff in C land writing directly back to a buffer

[15:18] quinnirill: oh, now I'm a bit confused :D
[15:18] benvie: yeah this might not be what you want =D
[15:18] benvie: I mean it can do it but, not exactly safely
[15:19] quinnirill: yeah, well this module isn't going to be very safe anyway, I'm trying to expose the C api as directly as possible :D
[15:20] benvie: ffi is able to make it work presumably because it's doing stuff to the event loop to ensure thread safe writing and stuff
[15:20] benvie: node-ffi
[15:20] herbySk has joined the channel
[15:20] lmorchard has joined the channel
[15:20] isaacs: savudin: no, i recommend using javascript.  it's healthy
[15:21] quinnirill: but sheez, I just want to pass a Node::Buffer instance created in C++ as an argument to a JS function, I was betting there'd be a way to do that. :D
[15:21] isaacs: benvie: node-ffi is sllloooowww though
[15:21] bnoordhuis: quinnirill: buffer->handle_
[15:21] benvie: oh I thought you wanted to go the other way
[15:21] benvie: yeah wer're trying to improve on that with the combo
[15:21] isaacs: quinnirill: there is.  but you'll be creating SlowBuffers, not Buffers.
[15:21] isaacs: quinnirill: though, i heard rumors lately that they're not that slow.
[15:21] isaacs: so who knows
[15:22] kevwil has joined the channel
[15:22] benvie: this thing I made is so it can change it's api over to primarily buffer based instead of libffis pointer based way of looking at the data
[15:22] karterk_ has joined the channel
[15:22] quinnirill: isaacs: yeah, well, I'll try to replace them with ArrayViews ASAP, just a temporary solution
[15:22] quinnirill: s/Array/Data
[15:22] benvie: I thinik what he was looking as was basically
[15:22] isaacs: v8::Handle<Function> someJSFunc;  ...;  result = someJSFunc.call(scopeObjectHandle, numArgs, {arg, arg, arg});
[15:23] isaacs: where arg is one of bufferObject->handle_
[15:23] trotter has joined the channel
[15:23] benvie: with this data that is being written out to ffi can be written to a node buffer and then used

[15:23] benvie: without needing to hit the C++ side
[15:23] benvie: aside from getting the address
[15:24] zemanel has joined the channel
[15:24] benvie: so instead of having to use the C++ bindings to for each write individual

[15:31] isaacs: quinnirill: it's a lot of ceremony, yes.
[15:31] isaacs: quinnirill: but then the JS passes two buffers to the C++
[15:32] isaacs: quinnirill: the C++ has a pointer where it can start writing/reading, and an offset and length
[15:32] isaacs: quinnirill: it does some stuff, writes the results to the bufferOutput, and calls the cb when it's done
[15:32] isaacs: (or not, if it's sync)
[15:32] at4m has joined the channel
[15:33] isaacs: quinnirill: all the fs and zlib stuff works this way, for example.
[15:33] quinnirill: isaacs: hmm, interesting, seems like a cool approach. I'm not sure I can adapt to that in this case, though
[15:33] isaacs: quinnirill: it lets the C++ bits be as simple as possible, and you can then move almost all of the logic into the JS layer, which is much easier to manage.

I have a project with node 0.4.8 but the npm version I have installed requires 0.6.. I'm using n to manage versions right now though.. but I'd switch to nave if it provides a solution

[17:16] isaacs: hydrozen: yes and no.
[17:16] isaacs: hydrozen: :)
[17:16] isaacs: hydrozen: if you do this, it'll work like you probably want: `nave use 0.4.8; curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh`
[17:16] isaacs: hydrozen: that'll install npm 1.0 (not 1.1) in the 0.4.8 subshell
[17:16] isaacs: hydrozen: it'll be in ~/.nave/installed/0.4.8/bin/...

[20:18] Marak_: isaacs: when using npm.commands.install programatically, npm is now adding additional fields to the package.json, which are violating some of our validation rules for what a valid package is
[20:19] Marak_: i also would rather not have extra fields that the user has to read, if they arent 100% needed
[20:20] isaacs: Marak_: most of the time, the user does not need to read these.
[20:20] isaacs: Marak_: since it's only added when you install something with npm, not to git submodules, or your top-level package, etc.
[20:21] Marak_: isaacs: this is not most of the time

[20:31] mmalecki: I mean, if I can't fix it, I'll just pull your thing
[20:31] jerrysv: Marak_: spent a few hours tracking down why code with EventReactor was failing tests in vows, finally printed out the emit() method
[20:31] Marak_: jerrysv: got ya
[20:31] jerrysv: mmalecki: will only pollute the emitter that is install by npm in its node_modules unless someone is crazy enough to be installing everything -g

[20:59] Andy1991: Ok, thank you :)
[20:59] rachet: basically, I am trying to make my http.request store cookies and follow redirects,  but it seems that after a few redirects deep, it stops closing the request
[20:59] rachet: or at least appears to
[21:00] Andy1991: God I'm a noob
[21:00] sammmy: works like this: yarn(initialFunction)(fun0, fun1,...)(fun0, fun1, ...)(...); in initialFunction this(0) returns the fun0 in the next series. In any function in the series, this(n) returns the nth function in the next series.

[21:03] sammmy: Andy1991: My pattern is actually really simple. I should get to writing that README.md file on github, so you can see some examples. Although, there are some design changes I was thinking of making.
[21:04] Andy1991: This async thing looks really easy though, I didn't understand your code
[21:04] rachet: basically, if I can't get this working within about an hour - I have to start fixing ruby gems to do the same thing 
[21:04] Andy1991: Do I need to do an npm install async or is it built in?
[21:04] rachet: you need to install it

[21:18] Andy1991: Thanks for the help guys :)
[21:18] hdon: there are no symlinks here it seems
[21:18] hdon: so i now have two copies of socket.io
[21:18] isaacs: hdon: no.
[21:18] isaacs: hdon: yes, that is correct
[21:18] hdon: isaacs: well.. why?
[21:18] isaacs: socket.io was installed underneath hook.io, since it wasn't a top-level dependency
[21:19] hdon: ACTION furrows his brow
[21:19] isaacs: hdon: `npm install hook.io` and you'll only have one socket.io
[21:19] isaacs: hdon: since the new install will use the current socket.io that it sees ther
[21:19] hdon: isaacs: so if i install them system-wide, then i won't have this problem?
[21:19] jetienne_ has joined the channel
[21:19] isaacs: or you can just rm -rf node_modules/hook.io/node_modules/socket.io
[21:19] isaacs: hdon: no.  there is no "system-wide" when it comes to require()able modules.
[21:19] isaacs: hdon: and deps are always nested.
[21:20] isaacs: that is the only way to avoid collisions
[21:20] hdon: hmm
[21:20] jaha has joined the channel
[21:21] isaacs: or at least, it's npm's way to avoid collisions :)
[21:21] isaacs: the other options are generally require a lot of human effort
[21:22] hdon: isaacs: what is there to collide? i can only think that maybe hook.io knows what version of socket.io it wants, and it might not be another version i have installed... does all of this mean that there may be more than one instance of the same module loaded?
[21:22] iain_: ACTION is annoyed that n hits major compilation issues in fbsd, the node port installs fine but I want n to manage that stuff
[21:22] hdon: "loaded" into the javascript interpreter (node process)
[21:22] isaacs: iain_: if you use nave, you can set any config options you want in NAVE_CONFIG environment var
[21:22] Es0teric: so in express when making a file, i route it with app.get() then tell it what to do in routes/ ?
[21:22] iain_: isaacs: nave?
[21:22] isaacs: hdon: yeah, so what?
[21:22] isaacs: hdon: if you have dependencies on two separate versions, how can you solve that without loading two versions?
[21:23] hdon: isaacs: right, i just wanted to make sure i understood that was the rationale for this
[21:23] iain_: isaacs: I want the n npm module, i.e. the same as I'd use in deb/ubuntu

[21:56] EhevuTov_ has joined the channel
[21:57] mikl has joined the channel
[21:58] benvie has left the channel

[21:58] Es0teric: shinuza wait is this on the app.js?

[21:59] mAritz has joined the channel
[21:59] shinuza: tjholowaychuk: you have any idea why this does work? http://pastie.org/3644150
[21:59] Es0teric: shinuza so its app.get('/file', function(res, req) { res.render('template.ejs') }); ?
[21:59] shinuza: by not working I mean, that the request never ends
[21:59] hh__: is there a point to using a couchdb mdule as oppose to just writing http requests? do most people even bother with the couchdb module?
[21:59] shinuza: Es0teric: yes
[21:59] Es0teric: intresting…, shinuza 
[22:00] shinuza: you have to do some configuration regarding the place when expres will find the templates
[22:00] hh__: parameters should be req,res read the guide basic stuff
[22:01] Es0teric: shinuza express finds the templates in /views
[22:01] shinuza: then put template.ejs in there, and it should work
[22:01] Es0teric: yeah yeah
[22:02] Es0teric: shinuza so then app.get('/file') <--- thats whats in /routes right?
[22:02] shinuza: \/routes? what's this?
[22:02] Es0teric: theres a folder called /routes
[22:03] shinuza: you've generated an app using express command line?
[22:03] hh__: read the guide, '/file' would be the URI you are telling express router to match
[22:03] Es0teric: yeah, shinuza 
[22:03] Es0teric: hh__ i READ the guide
[22:03] hh__: has nothing to do with routes dir
[22:03] tjholowaychuk: Es0teric "/file" doesn't really mean anything
[22:03] tjholowaychuk: it's just a string
[22:04] tjholowaychuk: you can do whatever you want with that, it could be a file on disk, a template you render, something from a database etc
[22:04] hh__: routers dir is arbitrary , you can name it anything
[22:04] Es0teric: ok so then whats the default directory that it gets the files from?
[22:04] hh__: there is no default
[22:04] hh__: you specify
[22:04] shinuza: Es0teric: by default express doesn't serve files
[22:05] Es0teric: shinuza so then app.get() is what serves files right?
[22:05] shinuza: wrong terminology
[22:05] hh__: that's just registering a route
[22:05] reed_ has joined the channel
[22:05] shinuza: serving a file, to me, is serving the content of the file
[22:05] ph^ has joined the channel
[22:05] dividinglimits has joined the channel
[22:05] Es0teric: so then how do i serve the content of the file?
[22:06] shinuza: what you wrote earlier will render the template template.eks
[22:06] shinuza: Es0teric: depends what you want to do
[22:06] elifou has joined the channel
[22:06] dylang_ has joined the channel
[22:06] shinuza: if you want to serve a bunch of static files, use the express.static middleware
[22:06] franciscallo has joined the channel
[22:06] shinuza: otherwise you can use res.sendfile(path)
[22:06] Es0teric: ok so lets say i do app.get('/file', function(req, res) { res.render('template.ejs') }); that will render template.ejs on local.host:3000/file ?
[22:07] Es0teric: i dont want static files
[22:07] Es0teric: i am trying to build dynamic files here
[22:07] shinuza: but if you want to "serve" a ejs file, I'm pretty sure you'd want to render it instead
[22:07] shinuza: Es0teric: yes this will render the template
[22:08] shinuza: render takes a second parameter which is the context to pass to the template
[22:08] Es0teric: ok, shinuza now… an additional question - what if i have variables in a .js file? where would i put the .js file and how would i tell it to variables from that .js file to pass to the template.ejs?

[22:09] Andy1991: Should I be using foreach or for to iterate an array?
[22:09] shinuza: Andy1991: forEach should work
[22:09] hh__: for
[22:09] Andy1991: is foreach slow?
[22:09] hh__: yes
[22:09] shinuza: it depends what kind of function you are using
[22:09] Andy1991: ok thanks
[22:09] shinuza: Andy1991: it used to be slow
[22:10] shinuza: it's not *that* slow
[22:10] Andy1991: but for is faster?
[22:10] shinuza: yes, if you are writing "low level" code use for
[22:10] Andy1991: cheers
[22:10] shinuza: you should check out the jsperf tests on that to get an idea
[22:10] hh__: just make sure you do something like, for (var i = 0, len = Array.length; ..etc.
[22:11] shinuza: Es0teric: you can put that file wherever you want, then you use require('./myfile.js') (read the documentation on modules)
[22:11] Andy1991: I defined the length outside, I know it's faster than count inside the loop in php
[22:11] Andy1991: is this the case with node?
[22:11] Andy1991:       var len = response.routes.length;
[22:11] Andy1991:       for(var i = 0; i < len; i++) {
[22:11] Es0teric: i am not trying to make a module
[22:11] Es0teric: i am trying to reference a file 
[22:12] hh__: just defined it within the for paramters
[22:12] shinuza: and then you need to call res.render('template.ejs', {'foo': myVariable})
[22:12] dukeytoo2 has joined the channel
[22:12] hh__: for(var i = 0, len = response.routes.length; i < len; i++) { .... }
[22:12] Andy1991: But doesnt that call .length on every iteration when it's only needed once?
[22:12] shinuza: no
[22:12] hh__: no
[22:12] Es0teric: shinuza its simple - i want to make a .js file, then set it to a url(of course) then have the template render in that url
[22:12] Andy1991: oki =D
[22:12] Andy1991: that makes life easier
[22:12] shinuza: these variables are hoisted to the top of the function
[22:12] Andy1991: thanks
[22:13] shinuza: even in a for loop
[22:13] Es0teric: and pass the values FROM that .js file into the template file
[22:13] Andy1991: Oh yeah, I forgot about that
[22:13] hh__: for (var i =0; i < response.routes.length ... would do that Andy1991 
[22:13] Andy1991: function scope
[22:13] Andy1991: thanks =D
[22:13] shinuza: Es0teric: in the node.js env you need to make a module, as simple as it is
[22:14] hellp has joined the channel
[22:14] arduix has joined the channel
[22:14] shinuza: Andy1991: how many times do you call this for loop
[22:14] Es0teric: in node.js all i need to do is make a file then reference it in the url like so: local.host:3000/myfile
[22:14] fomatin has joined the channel

[22:14] Es0teric: and anything that was in the file will render on the page
[22:14] TheEmpath2: if cluster can restart workers and I'm running the master process in nohup.. do I even need forever?
[22:14] shinuza: Es0teric: in node.js?
[22:15] Es0teric: yeah
[22:15] shinuza: then do what we discussed earlier
[22:15] Es0teric: idk why i cant make a js file then have a template load
[22:15] Es0teric: dude, i want to BUT i dont know where to save the js file
[22:15] shinuza: TheEmpath2: forever is a way to do it
[22:15] Es0teric: idk where the js file should go
[22:16] shinuza: but you won't need nohup
[22:16] shinuza: forever forks the process by itself
[22:16] rtgibbons has joined the channel
[22:16] TheEmpath2: so does cluster
[22:16] TheEmpath2: well you can tell it to with cluster.fork when a process dies
[22:16] shinuza: TheEmpath2: cluster shares the port between workers
[22:17] shinuza: it's just the same as if there were only one worker
[22:17] TheEmpath2: shinuza: it can also restart failed workers
[22:17] shinuza: Es0teric: you can put it wherever you want, but you HAVE to require it
[22:17] shinuza: make a module, etc...
[22:17] TheEmpath2: im curious if forever will bring something else to the table since cluster can restart failed workers
[22:17] shinuza: there's no other way to this, except evil stuff
[22:18] Andy1991: Es0teric it varies
[22:18] joshgillies has joined the channel
[22:18] Andy1991: I'm looping through a json google directions response

[22:18] Es0teric: 	res.render('dash.ejs', {foo: 'var1'});
[22:18] Es0teric: });
[22:18] Es0teric: something like that?
[22:18] shinuza: TheEmpath2: forever will just run the node app (in fact it's language agnostic)

[22:19] shinuza: Es0teric: you have to read the doc on modules,

[22:20] c4milo has joined the channel
[22:20] shinuza: the reste of the code is cool tho
[22:21] Es0teric: shinuza so then its var someVar = require('/path/of/file'); then someVar.property or someVar.method?
[22:21] shinuza: yes
[22:21] Es0teric: hmm...
[22:21] Es0teric: kinda complex

[23:28] hobodave: actually let me update with my latest refactoring

[23:29] hobodave: I will gladly take any criticism or observations
[23:30] hobodave: the things that are bugging me now is the seemingly out of place and clunky config loading I do on lines 18 - 33
[23:30] hobodave: as well as the seemingly disjoint definition of my Socket.IO functionality starting on line 82
[23:31] yaymukund: hobodave: why does parseConfig warrant being its own function? it's never used again

[23:31] isaacs: TheEmpath2: it's not that /usr/bin/env doesn't exist.  it's that some script is asking env to start a program that doesn't exist.
[23:32] isaacs: TheEmpath2: the most liekly candidate is python or node, in that case.
[23:32] hobodave: I think the reason I wrote it that way was that it would be a plain english description of what yaml.load(fs.readFileSync(…)) was doing
[23:32] yaymukund: hobodave: ah, just to encapsulate. I see

[23:36] yaymukund: hobodave: any reason you can't split it up into multiple files? I'm not an expert either, but that's where I'd start.

[23:37] hobodave: yaymukund well my dependence on the global variables being visible in the inner scopes prevents that
[23:37] hobodave: so I'm stuck either adding a ton of params to various functions

[23:37] hobodave: or leaving it as is
[23:38] hobodave: that's why I'm looking for best practices, or at least some guides/blog posts
[23:38] hobodave: but yes that's definitely something that seems warranted
