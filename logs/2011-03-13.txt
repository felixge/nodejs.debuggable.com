[01:15] Gigawatt: i then do util.inherit(userController,baseController);

[01:16] Gigawatt: i send the reference of baseController to userController

[02:11] marcello3d: adamb: why mongoose?
[02:11] marcello3d: (out of curiosity)
[02:12] bingomanatee: Hey Marcello - I am presenting at the Mongo meetup in SF
[02:12] bingomanatee: I'm putting a word in for Mongolian. 
[02:12] marcello3d: oh fun
[02:12] adamb: this project was started this morning.  mongoose was one of many decisions made based on a few factors including the amount of activity on the poject
[02:12] bingomanatee: anything in particular you'd like me to highlight?
[02:13] bingomanatee: Mongoose is not bad - but I wouldn't neglect learning the ins and outs of the native stack its built on. 
[02:13] bingomanatee: To the best of my knowledge you'll need to to do map / reduce for instance. 
[02:13] adamb: we have experience with ORMs so the docs made the mongoose seem real nice
[02:13] marcello3d: I don't know, KISS, or porting from ruby can have dire consequences? :)
[02:13] bingomanatee: It is fairly nice. 
[02:14] sechrist has joined the channel
[02:14] monokrome: Hmm. What are the best ways to do inheritance with jade?
[02:14] bingomanatee: If you are schema oriented and want to type proof your data passively and care about transactional integrity Mongoose is great. 
[02:14] Gigawatt: mono you mean extending the jade object
[02:14] monokrome: No, I mean extending other templates.
[02:14] adamb: i was just in collections.js and there is no 'forEach' on line 65.  so i am confused but i chalked that up to my lack of understanding node
[02:15] zachsmith: yeah, mongolian is awesome
[02:15] monokrome: I am trying to find a good way to get rid of the repetition in this templates: https://github.com/monokrome/monokro.me-node/tree/master/templates
[02:15] bingomanatee: However keep in mind - there is no way that all that transactional checking, schema validation et all can make your app run FASTER so the only question is, is the slowness Mongoose adds to your equation worth it? 
[02:16] visa has joined the channel
[02:16] marcello3d: the main problem with ORM on mongodb is that essentially require you to pull the full document into memory, manipulate, and save out again
[02:16] adamb: not worried about slowness.  just worried about having a taller stack to search through if we have issues.  
[02:16] marcello3d: and as soon as you want to do partial updates or partial object retrievals, the advantages start to disappear
[02:17] adamb: happy to abandon mongoose if it makes it easier for us.  are there some cons besides performance?
[02:17] adamb: interesting
[02:17] zachsmith: Why put an orm on mongodb at all? the point of a document database it that there is no relational database to map to
[02:17] SubStack: chapel: too much inferential distance I suspect with respect to dnode
[02:17] chapel: inferential distance?
[02:17] SubStack: http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Inferential_distance 
[02:17] marcello3d: orm can be nice. it gives you some peace of mind that your data is in the format you want
[02:18] chapel: :P
[02:18] boaz has joined the channel
[02:18] SubStack: expectations of what rpc systems can do is really low
[02:18] marcello3d: I think orm is fine if you understand what it's doing
[02:18] chapel: yeah
[02:19] chapel: I guess my sadness comes from the fact that people clamor for nowjs
[02:19] marcello3d: but the only reason I don't like mongoose is they put their commas in funny places on their frontpage
[02:19] chapel: well not clamor
[02:19] SubStack: I think a prerequisite for understanding dnode is understanding the asynchronous nature of node
[02:19] chapel: but see it as this awesome new thing, when dnode has done it, and better for much longer
[02:19] chapel: yeah, there is that
[02:19] SubStack: well nowjs has replication which dnode doesn't have yet
[02:19] chapel: most people seem to not really understand the full asynchronous nature of node
[02:20] chapel: yet :P
[02:20] SubStack: once dnode gets ssh as a transport it should get some HN love
[02:20] Gigawatt: Node is all about non blocking I/O
[02:20] chapel: Im wanting to start up a blog again, and do some node posts
[02:20] chapel: I will definitely be talking up dnode
[02:20] chapel: :)
[02:20] marcello3d: non blocking i/o, who'da thunk
[02:21] marcello3d: SubStack: should I switch from socket.io to dnode?
[02:21] Gigawatt: it would make the backbone libev redundant, 
[02:21] SubStack: marcello3d: if you find rolling your own dispatching on top of socket.io is getting messy
[02:22] Gigawatt: i also believe in the passion that ralf dhal has, where the non blocking I/O with ibev over threadpools etc
[02:22] cloudhead2: dnode uses websockets?
[02:22] cloudhead2: SubStack: I thought nowjs would be built on top of dnode
[02:23] chapel: uses socket.io
[02:23] zachsmith: isn't dnode built on top of socket.io?
[02:23] Gigawatt: rolf*
[02:23] chapel: which can use websockets, flash, long polling
[02:23] chapel: and so on
[02:23] SubStack: the transport doesn't matter so much with dnode
[02:23] cloudhead2: ah didn't know that
[02:23] liar has joined the channel
[02:23] SubStack: it's more about the protocol and data transformation hat trick
[02:24] SubStack: dnode has socket.io and net.Stream transports
[02:24] marcello3d: SubStack: does it support any mechanisms for serializing the client commands?
[02:24] adamb: where is node.js?
[02:24] marcello3d: and by serializing I mean
[02:24] marcello3d: run commands in order after the previous finishes
[02:25] zachsmith: So do things like dnode kill REST for web apps, or is there still a use for it?
[02:25] marcello3d: e.g. if I want to authenticate, I send a command, but I want to pipeline additional commands after it that are dependent on the authentication command succeeding
[02:25] pdelgallego has joined the channel
[02:25] SubStack: zachsmith: pretty much you don't need to rest anymore
[02:25] zachsmith: :-D
[02:25] zachsmith: that makes me happy
[02:25] SubStack: you can have state now!
[02:26] marcello3d: zachsmith: you might still want rest for 3rd party apis
[02:26] SubStack: marcello3d: you can just serve up the functions you want to sit behind the auth method by only returning those methods to the callback given to the auth method
[02:27] SubStack: marcello3d: http://github.com/substack/dnode/tree/master/examples/auth 
[02:27] SubStack: yeah 3rd party apis are pesky but I do have perl and ruby adapters for dnode already
[02:27] DTrejo has joined the channel
[02:27] SubStack: and half of a python one
[02:27] SubStack: jesusabdullah wrote that
[02:28] zachsmith: SubStack: nice!
[02:28] marcello3d: SubStack: why not provide rest versions? 
[02:28] SubStack: because rest is stateless
[02:28] SubStack: and dnode is all about state
[02:28] marcello3d: ah
[02:28] marcello3d: that's annoying when you're scaling though
[02:28] chapel: not really
[02:29] marcello3d: if you have 4 servers that are load balanced
[02:29] SubStack: well it's easy to distribute tasks across multiple servers
[02:29] marcello3d: jsonp 1 goes to server 1, jsonp 2 goes to server 2
[02:29] SubStack: since your servers can just talk to each other over dnode too
[02:29] chapel: the nice thing about dnode is not only can you have statebetween browser and server, but you can have state between processes
[02:29] chapel: what SubStack said :)
[02:29] marcello3d: yea but you have to do a lot more work
[02:30] marcello3d: how do you handle the load balanced case? assuming you're not on websockets
[02:30] SubStack: authenticating backends can be pesky still
[02:30] zemanel has joined the channel

[02:31] jesusabdullah: and then never code in python again ;)
[02:31] SubStack: jesusabdullah: rawk!
[02:31] jesusabdullah: Yeah
[02:31] jesusabdullah: It needs to be done

[02:39] bingomanatee: Though my knowledge of real name ... nick is not comprehensive. 
[02:39] yonkeltron: is ther some unified simple messaging library for node-to-node communication? like socket.io but not for the browser?
[02:39] yonkeltron: i know i could just write it with ease but wondering what's there already
[02:39] bingomanatee: REST?
[02:40] fr0stbyte has joined the channel
[02:40] bingomanatee: not to be coy but ... REST pattern communication is pretty much a no brainer for server to server comm. 
[02:40] zachsmith: what do you guys think about generating mongo objectIds on the client, is that a bad idea if I validate and sanitize them?
[02:40] rrachel has joined the channel
[02:40] marcello3d: zachsmith: they usually are generated on the client, aren't they?
[02:40] SubStack: yonkeltron: well you can just open up a socket directly between processes
[02:40] bingomanatee: To what end?
[02:40] ParadoxQuine: anyone have a good link explaining the advantages/disadvantages of something like dnode's stated approach vs REST and stateless?
[02:40] zachsmith: I mean browser
[02:40] marcello3d: oh
[02:41] marcello3d: that seems questionable at best
[02:41] rrachel: Does node.js have any support for Diffie-Hellman key exchange?
[02:41] zachsmith: but super useful!
[02:41] zachsmith: lol
[02:41] marcello3d: unless you're tying them to the user
[02:41] SubStack: rrachel: hah!
[02:41] SubStack: rrachel: working on that
[02:41] SubStack: rrachel: do you need it for ssh?
[02:41] f1lt3r_ has joined the channel
[02:42] bingomanatee: ParadoxQuine - you do get the principle of sockets - once you open a socket, you don't have any overhead of continual encapsulation and de-encapsulation of your content. 
[02:42] rrachel: Yeah I wanna make an encrypted chat thing with node
[02:42] bingomanatee: Sockets, once established, are the fastest conceivable way of sending data over the network. It is pure binary data 
[02:42] ParadoxQuine: makes sense
[02:42] marcello3d: bingomanatee: faster than udp? :D
[02:42] bingomanatee: hmmm. 
[02:42] zachsmith: marcello3d: For example, a user creates a "post" in the browser, I'd like to have an id tied to it without waiting for the server to get back to me
[02:43] okuryu has joined the channel
[02:43] bingomanatee: That sounds like something that I'd like to see some actual tests on. 
[02:43] marcello3d: zachsmith: I think it depends on the nature of the app. obviously if you trust the user, or if generating a bad id only hurts the client, then it's fine
[02:43] marcello3d: bingomanatee: well, considering tcp is built on top...
[02:44] rrachel: SubStack: What're you working on?
[02:44] yonkeltron: SubStack: yeah, i was just wondering if someone had done something more clever. no worries. thanks.
[02:44] zachsmith: right
[02:44] bingomanatee: yes - but once a connection is made, wouldn't the trans pport layer be obviated by the binary stream? 
[02:44] marcello3d: udp doesn't have a connection
[02:44] bingomanatee: I'm not an expert in this and would rather de-puff my understanding - SubStack - what do you thing? Sockets v. UDP? 
[02:44] marcello3d: https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol#Comparison_of_UDP_and_TCP

[02:48] bingomanatee: Fortunately these kind of tests are cheap to make and run. 
[02:48] zakabird: udp is just a socket protocol, i.e. a type of socket. not seperate thing.  does less for you so can be faster

[03:14] Utkarsh has joined the channel
[03:14] tbranyen: boaz: you pull down latest, ./configure && make ; sudo make install
[03:15] boaz: no issues with rebuilding from source over an existing build?
[03:15] tbranyen: no
[03:15] Lion2Leo: Anyone here is at ease with ejs could enlighten me on a question
[03:15] tbranyen: your install will overwrite the node binary
[03:16] boaz: cool
[03:16] boaz: lol, it's 401ing
[03:16] zachsmith: boaz are you on mac?
[03:16] boaz: zachsmith: mhmm
[03:16] zachsmith: use homebrew
[03:16] zachsmith: unless you want to build it yourself
[03:16] tbranyen: zachsmith: haven't had any issues doing what i just said on os x
[03:16] boaz: is brew up to date?

[03:54] yonkeltron: and it kind of sucked
[03:54] yonkeltron: maybe not even that project
[03:55] Lion2Leo: Hey guys, I define a new prop on socket.io client object on the server side, wouldn't that property get set before the client side? Because client side I get undefined
[03:56] yonkeltron: they are not the same object
[03:56] DTrejo: Lion2Leo: there's some confusing naming
[03:57] Lion2Leo: Well I access to the client object that I receive from the trigger event
[03:57] Lion2Leo: So It should be the same obj
[03:59] abraham has joined the channel
[03:59] yonkeltron: Lion2Leo: if i call your cell phone, are our phones the same phone?

[04:00] yonkeltron: right
[04:00] yonkeltron: together, they make a call
[04:00] yonkeltron: but what happens to one phone doesn't happen on the other
[04:00] Lion2Leo: Ok well look, I'll make a quick pastie to make it clearer, I just started with JS so you will enlighten me
[04:00] Lion2Leo: You are right about that :)

[04:02] monokrome: Hmm.. Does npm take some time to update packages after publishing?
[04:03] yonkeltron: ok you think that they are the same object
[04:03] Lion2Leo: yonkeltron: Well... it would seem logical to me
[04:03] yonkeltron: Lion2Leo: the client object gotten by the server is an object which represents the client, it isn't actually the client
[04:03] yonkeltron: it's the phone connected to my phone
[04:03] Lion2Leo: yonkeltron: I did a lot of QT and passing objects with emits and connects which is why I'm confused
[04:03] yonkeltron: you use it to send a message to my phone
[04:04] yonkeltron: two separate processes
[04:04] yonkeltron: two separate object spaces
[04:04] Lion2Leo: Ok well could you suggest me a route
[04:04] yonkeltron: ok
[04:04] yonkeltron: i am trying to think of a way to explain it
[04:04] yonkeltron: ok ready?
[04:04] yonkeltron: ever used a tin-can phone system?
[04:04] Lion2Leo: Aie
[04:04] yonkeltron: like, when you were a kid?
[04:04] Lion2Leo: I've heard of them in legends
[04:04] Lion2Leo: But yeah I did
[04:04] yonkeltron: hehe
[04:04] yonkeltron: ok
[04:05] yonkeltron: so if i have one to my neighbor's house and it's labeled "neighbor"
[04:05] yonkeltron: is their end the same as my end?
[04:05] yonkeltron: no
[04:05] yonkeltron: that tin can represents my neighbor
[04:05] yonkeltron: the client object your server gets represents your client
[04:05] yonkeltron: it's not the same object
[04:05] yonkeltron: but
[04:05] yonkeltron: you can use it to send a message
[04:06] yonkeltron: i may have given you a horrible example
[04:06] Lion2Leo: Well the fact that you started talking about server on a tin-can kid example was a bit off
[04:06] Lion2Leo: Otherwise that's good enough
[04:06] yonkeltron: i might want to have some booze about now
[04:06] yonkeltron: i'm working on a dataflow processing framework
[04:06] yonkeltron: for function pipelines
[04:06] Lion2Leo: Alright, but a message is a string of char's or anything I want?
[04:07] yonkeltron: i'd guess that you should limit yourself to JSON
[04:07] Lion2Leo: I have a simple problem and I do not know how to fix it.
[04:07] Lion2Leo: I can explain it to you rather simply, you could give me insight on how I should proceed

[04:08] yonkeltron: sure, let me get my tin-cans out
[04:09] Lion2Leo: Hmmm...
[04:09] Lion2Leo: I ask the user for his name on the first message event, I would like to access this name on the client-side js script
[04:09] zachsmith: Lion2Leo: if you want something where you can set a variable on an object, and have it show up on the client try nowjs
[04:10] Lion2Leo: zachsmith: I will look into it, I'm currently using socket.io and express
[04:10] sleeplessinc has joined the channel
[04:10] zachsmith: nowjs is built on top of socket.io
[04:11] Lion2Leo: zachsmith: Alright, good to know. Although I might have found a way to get my thing to work

[04:12] yonkeltron: agreed
[04:12] JianMeng1 has left the channel
[04:12] Lion2Leo: Turns out that addListener('clientConnected',Y) and on.('connect', Y) are two different things
[04:13] Lion2Leo: I just replaced all my addEvent and addListener by on's and it fixed my problem
[04:13] zachsmith: what's the difference?
[04:13] Lion2Leo: zachsmith: Well the ones in the doc's act stangely
[04:14] Lion2Leo: The server was replying x times the number of page jumps
[04:14] Lion2Leo: Instead of flushing the connection
[04:14] Lion2Leo: Even jumping from a page logged as a "disconnection"
[04:14] Lion2Leo: Very odd behaviour

[04:21] Lion2Leo: Although I abide by the rule  : "Bad docs = I don't use that ###"

[07:25] mscdex: Twelve-60: yep
[07:25] konobi: zab: REST API?
[07:25] zab: nah JS api
[07:25] zab: so expecting JS types, like strings, objects and dates
[07:26] zab: but this being JS, folks could just give me a string where I ask for a Date instance
[07:26] konobi: so some custom serialization format?
[07:26] zab: no, just setting some properties on a JS object
[07:27] konobi: oh... a module
[07:27] yumike has joined the channel
[07:27] zab: yeah
[07:27] zab: heh should've said that
[07:29] konobi: i'd steal stuff from Moose Types/Coercions... but that's just me
[07:29] foober1: Can't you just use 'if (typeof object == 'string') {/*something*/}'?
[07:29] stagas: zab: you could use setters or a custom method on the object .setValue() etc
[07:30] zab: konobi: interesting
[07:30] zab: foober1: yeah was going to do this, but not sure if its that great to ignore things if they are not the correct type
[07:31] zab: stagas: and throw an exception or something?
[07:32] foober1: Well you put any further tests and the final error message for unhandled types in the else clause.  No reason to allow just any old object.
[07:33] stagas: zab: for a custom method you can return false and let the users check for it
[07:33] foober1: I do like stagas' suggestion of custom setters/getters though.  Much cleaner if you've got several types to worry about.
[07:34] zab: hmm, but that doesn't prevent someone from setting the properties directly, bypassing the custom setters
[07:34] zab: i guess theres always a tradeoff
[07:34] stagas: you could use a combination of both
[07:34] konobi: zab: well, if you use the actual get/set stuff and the language level
[07:35] konobi: zab: http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-getters-and-setters/
[07:35] zab: konobi: wow thats perfect
[07:36] zab: still new to JS

[07:41] AAA_awright: zab: You should be doing sanity checks when you read values anyways

[07:41] zab: AAA_awright: yes thats true.  I'm doing both.
[07:42] zab: AAA_awright: I've got somewhat unique problems because I'm passing the JS values back to c++ land and converting the v8 values back into c++ native types
[07:42] konobi: fail early, fail often
[07:42] AAA_awright: zab: Check the dynamic type before you convert to a static type?
[07:43] AAA_awright: I thought that's how it was done, but I haven't done V8
[07:43] dragunov11 has joined the channel
[07:44] zab: AAA_awright: yeah doing that.  you can ask v8 what type a value is pretty easily.  would just like the JS devs to know when a value won't be successfully parsed as well.

[08:56] ParadoxQuine: right
[08:56] secoif: I think you're probably looking for a client side js/css fix though
[08:56] ParadoxQuine: well it can all be done with css can't it? i always have a hard time getting it all tweaked quite right so i figured a stylus function
[08:57] ParadoxQuine: for example it could set the proper margins equal to negative half the height and width with the top/left 50% if it's the outermost div
[08:57] fr0stbyte has joined the channel

[10:29] SubStack: setInterval
[10:29] __tosh has joined the channel
[10:30] razvandimescu: what i want is basically agregator_server.getRequest("url",callback,100)
[10:30] SubStack: and there's http.get or http.request or modules like request for making web requests

[10:35] adamt: you can just do it directly  in your main file
[10:36] adamt: so, on the global object, or w/e it's called.

[11:01] stylus: hi, got a small conceptual question. i'm slowly but surely writing a chat server as a Node.js familiarisation exercise. im at the point where i want to incorporate channels (just like on irc) - coming from Java, i want to write a channel class in a separate file and import it into the server code so that creating channels is achieved by: chan = new Channel(name, etc.);
[11:02] Country has joined the channel
[11:02] stylus: this doesn't seem like the right approach in javascript though - how would the same thing be achieved?
[11:03] skm has joined the channel
[11:03] pascalopitz: stylus: I think you could do a module if you wanted to
[11:03] stagas: stylus: make a module that exports a constructor function and then var Channel = require('channel')
[11:04] pascalopitz: or define the "class" in the same file
[11:04] pascalopitz: var Channel = new function() {}
[11:05] stylus: that makes sense. I was wondering whether i could use modules, thanks :)
[11:05] pascalopitz: does it need to be evented?
[11:06] markwubben has joined the channel
[11:06] stylus: how do you mean? a channel would be created when someone issued a comand like 'join channel' to the server
[11:06] pascalopitz: well, you can make modules emit events
[11:06] pascalopitz: there's the EventEmitter in node.js
[11:07] pascalopitz: you'll have to work with prototypes though
[11:07] pascalopitz: if you implement that, you can do:
[11:07] pascalopitz: c = new Channel()
[11:07] pascalopitz: c.on('foo', function() {});
[11:07] pascalopitz: and in the channel you can:
[11:08] pascalopitz: this.trigger('foo', data)
[11:08] pascalopitz: like that you can let other modules subscribe to events
[11:08] pascalopitz: ]

[11:12] stylus: cheers!
[11:12] razvandimescu: how can i do an update to my installed node instance (0.2.6)
[11:13] pascalopitz: guille_: http://senchalabs.github.com/connect/middleware-static.html
[11:13] pascalopitz: raz: just recompile it, no?

[11:14] razvandimescu: pascalopitz: thanks ( i was hoping more for a node --update kind of thing :))
[11:14] pascalopitz: npm might do it?
[11:14] pascalopitz: I just always recompile it

[13:38] jamescarr: wait a second, I thought that it didnt matter?

[13:39] jamescarr: "app" in this case
[13:39] brianloveswords has joined the channel
[13:40] jamescarr: yeah, it's not the port. because / works even when the title changes

[13:43] shaunau: maybe its related to the headers..
[13:43] barrychapman: V1: still not working, do i need to use wss if the node server is not running on ssl?

[14:01] floby has joined the channel
[14:04] pascalopitz: is it actually possible to create a server that runs both, non-ssl and ssl?
[14:05] pascalopitz: I'd assume that you'd have to create an instance each?
[14:05] barrychapman: well our site runs in SSL only - but our chat server runs on port 80
[14:05] pascalopitz: would it be a big deal to create two instances?
[14:06] pascalopitz: and bind them to two different ports?
[14:06] barrychapman: well in theory yes
[14:06] pascalopitz: what client are we talking? a browser?
[14:06] barrychapman: yes
[14:07] pascalopitz: well, normally the browser would expect 443, right?
[14:07] pascalopitz: if, just for fun, you change the port to 443, does it work?
[14:07] barrychapman: let me test that
[14:08] Gigawatt: pascal, you got a min to help me?
[14:08] barrychapman: it wont let me bind to port 443
[14:09] Gigawatt: is the address already in use ?
[14:09] stylus: hi, given i have an array of client session IDs stored in a variable that i'd like to broadcast to (using the socket.io module) - what's the most efficient method of doing this?
[14:09] Gigawatt: instead of require("http"); do require("https").createServer(callback)
[14:10] Gigawatt: and then bind that to port 80 or 443
[14:10] barrychapman: well 443 is already listened on by apache
[14:11] Gigawatt: so does apache handle your chat ?
[14:11] pascalopitz: well, try ANY other port
[14:11] pascalopitz: just not 80

[14:40] floby: yes, since the rest of the website, can't you provide the chat over HTTPS as well ?
[14:40] Gigawatt: shaunau: i can't get the debugger to work on my code, for some reason it just runs and i can't step through the project!

[14:45] floby: Gigawatt: why 0.0.0.0 I usually go to localhost and also I use --debug-brk
[14:45] barrychapman: floby: i am not sure, it would require us getting another cert for the chat server
[14:45] shaunau: then start you code with: node debug appname
[14:46] floby: barrychapman: can't you use the same one as the website ?
[14:46] floby: barrychapman: it's an web chat server isn't ?
[14:46] barrychapman: well the chat server runs on a different subdomain
[14:46] barrychapman: chat.xxx.com versus www.xxx.com
[14:46] floby: barrychapman: snap
[14:47] barrychapman: huh?
[14:47] floby: barrychapman: what if your cert is for only xxx.com. I'm really not sure about that, but maybe it'd work for subdomains as well
[14:48] tanepiper: you need to get a wildcard cert

[18:02] tjholowaychuk: pz_f: sounds like it *should* work with anything
[18:02] tjholowaychuk: hmm
[18:03] pz_f: Well tj you might be able to help me, I have an array on the serverside and I need to access it's contents from a client-side js
[18:03] pz_f: I might be able to do it without nowjs, I do not hold the knowledge on how to do it though
[18:03] sstephenson: re: git shas in package.json - you can specify a github tarball url as an npm dependency, e.g. "express": "https://github.com/visionmedia/express/tarball/d867cc9"
[18:04] tjholowaychuk: sstephenson: that works with npm right now?
[18:04] adamt: pz_f: can't you just transform it to json?
[18:04] sstephenson: yup
[18:04] tjholowaychuk: nice!
[18:04] tjholowaychuk: much better
[18:04] sstephenson: i use it with npm bundle to lock to a specific rev of uglifyjs
[18:05] pz_f: adamt: What good will that do?
[18:05] tjholowaychuk: good to know
[18:05] sstephenson: since the author never pushes updates to npm 
[18:05] tjholowaychuk: haha
[18:05] tjholowaychuk: yeah its a big PITA sometimes, releasing JUST for npm
[18:05] tjholowaychuk: prematurely just because our app needs something quick
[18:05] sstephenson: yeah. would be cool if you could put a git url in there too
[18:05] guybrush: git-url + branch-name

[18:06] guybrush: right!
[18:06] adamt: pz_f: json is rather easy to send to the client, that's what you could do with it

[18:15] adamt: dve: no question reached the channel :)
[18:15] V1: but just doing a JSON.stringify on the server and a JSON.parse on the client would probably solve that..

[18:15] pz_f: V1: Got a link that could provide me with some info on that?
[18:16] V1: pz_f: The socket.io-node internals arent that well documented yet. But when you call the .send method of a client it will run the messages through the .encode method: https://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO-node/blob/master/lib/socket.io/utils.js#L22-30
[18:17] V1: but the encode method also accepts an array, as it will see that as multiple messages..

[18:24] jetienne: tjholowaychuk: do you see an issue with tag (about to code it, today or tomorrow)
[18:25] tjholowaychuk: Horofox: you could just do something like Book.get(req.params.book blah blah

[19:30] akellehe: How is sockets.io?
[19:30] totonex: I have used PHP on the server-side, but the way people are introduced to PHP is skipping over implementation details. Using node.js as both server and server-side script would help me understand how everything works.
[19:30] f1lt3r_: which is stored in couch, so when the server starts back up the application is in the same place you left it
[19:30] f1lt3r_: i really like sockets.io so far
[19:30] Ond: socket.io is great
[19:30] Ond: But I've taken to SubStack's project on top of socket.io, DNode
[19:31] akellehe: How is the compatibility?

[20:17] felixge: from the looks of the code it seems like you just stream.pipe() ?
[20:17] tjholowaychuk: felixge: a side from the range / conditional get support etc all it really does is pipe
[20:17] tjholowaychuk: yeah

[20:40] felixge: prettyrobots: anyway, no plans / ticket for it yet
[20:40] prettyrobots: Can Node.js do a handshake on an unencrypted stream. All I can see from the docs is "tls" which appears to initiate handshake at the outset.

[20:41] felixge: prettyrobots: not sure, I don't know ssl very well

[20:46] otaku_coder: hi, having an issue with jade and local javascript files. I have a standard express project layout, with stylesheets in public/stylesheets/style.css and scripts in /public/javascripts/script.js . my stylesheets load fine with a href='/stylesheets/style.css' but my scripts aren't loading with the equivalent src path. I can't see in the node logs where its trying to find the file
[20:47] tjholowaychuk: otaku_coder: can I see a gist of your config?
[20:47] tjholowaychuk: sounds funky
[20:47] tjholowaychuk: script(src='/javascripts.script.js') should be fine
[20:47] tjholowaychuk: whoops
[20:48] tjholowaychuk: script(src='/javascripts/script.js')
[20:48] otaku_coder: script(type='text/javscript', src='happy.js') is what i have
[20:48] dnolen has joined the channel
[20:48] tjholowaychuk: well you need /javascripts in there
[20:49] tjholowaychuk: just like you have for the stylesheets
[20:49] otaku_coder: i did, and it didnt work
[20:49] tbranyen: jvascript
[20:49] tbranyen: javscript* << this doesn't look quite right :-p
[20:49] otaku_coder: however, i just removed the type attribute and it now suddenly works
[20:49] tbranyen: because your type was incorrect
[20:49] tjholowaychuk: otaku_coder: oh, haha yeah you have a typo
[20:50] tjholowaychuk: didnt see that

[20:55] dominic_ has joined the channel
[20:56] pz_f: tbranyen: Hmm well, I was wondering if it was possible to do something like socket.emit('customEvent') and on the client side do socket.on('customEvent', func...{})
[20:56] pz_f: Cause on each connection I push into an array the connected client, but I have no idea how to access the array on the client side
[20:57] Evet has joined the channel
[20:57] tbranyen: pz_f: yeah you won't want to send that array since it contains objects that have circular references
[20:57] tbranyen: can't be serialized to json
[20:58] tbranyen: might be better to use an object hash map pointing a token to a client and sending down the tokens so you can look them up ?
[20:58] tbranyen: instead of an array
[20:58] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[20:58] tbranyen: then to get an array of all the connected clients you could do Object.keys( clients ) or something
[20:59] dnolen has joined the channel
[20:59] tbranyen: as for the emitting, i don't think that will work, since socket.io is normalizing the events it emits to work across different connection methods
[20:59] tbranyen: its not a 1:1
[20:59] pz_f: tbranyen: I'm lost now haha...
[21:00] tbranyen: pz_f: why do you want the clients array on the client side?
[21:00] pz_f: The stuff I store inside my array atm are simple strings
[21:00] tbranyen: 17:01 < pz_f> Cause on each connection I push into an array the connected client, but I have no idea how to access the array on the client side
[21:00] pz_f: I want to have a list of currently connected people
[21:01] pz_f: By "Connected client" I don't mean the client object from socket.io, I meant regular info I get from a submitted form prior to connecting
[21:02] tbranyen: pz_f: ah okay gotcha, might be beneficial to keep a reference to that as well
[21:02] tbranyen: easier to do private messaging with that

[21:03] pz_f: tbranyen: I only have experience with c++ on the qt framework and perl programming, networking really isn't my cup of tea
[21:03] isaacs: pz_f: not really.  objects (including arrays and functions) have identity and are passed by ref.  all others are passed by val.

[21:06] v8bot: tbranyen: "lol"
[21:06] tbranyen: welp
[21:06] tbranyen: this is fracturing my knowledge of js
[21:06] tbranyen: sec
[21:06] isaacs: v8: a = {};  Object.defineProperty(a, "name", {value:"foo", writable:false}); b = a; b.name="bar"; [a.name, b.name]

[21:08] isaacs: if functions weren't passed by reference, then you'd have huge problems setting prototypes!
[21:08] jetienne: mscdex: :)
[21:09] tbranyen: isaacs: yeah that makes sense, could have sworn arrays/objects were the only types
[21:09] isaacs: well, it's actually only Objects.
[21:09] isaacs: functions ARE Objects.
[21:09] isaacs: v8: function a(){};  a instanceof Object
[21:09] v8bot: isaacs: true
[21:09] isaacs: see? ^
[21:10] tbranyen: nah not what i meant
[21:10] tbranyen: sure all js types are objects
[21:10] isaacs: no
[21:10] tbranyen: but there is a distinct difference between a literal object and a function object
[21:10] isaacs: v8: "asdf" instanceof Object
[21:10] v8bot: isaacs: false
[21:10] isaacs: tbranyen: only objects are objects.  Booleans, strings, and numbers are different.
[21:10] isaacs: they can be *cast* to objects
[21:11] isaacs: which is what happens when you do "asdf".length
[21:11] pz_f: W3schools puts strings and arrays under the object category
[21:11] isaacs: w3schools is on a mission to destroy understanding.
[21:11] jetienne: v8: typeof new Boolean(true)
[21:11] v8bot: jetienne: "object"
[21:11] isaacs: they are evil.  actual evil.
[21:11] pz_f: Well that's good to know I based myself on it
[21:11] tbranyen: isaacs: i don't think you can operate on just primatives in JS
[21:11] Minos has joined the channel
[21:11] jetienne: :) dont mess with js. no good for you :)
[21:11] isaacs: tbranyen: what do you mean "operate on"
[21:11] isaacs: ?
[21:11] tbranyen: isaacs: do anything with
[21:12] mscdex: node.js rules!
[21:12] tbranyen: any operator will invoke a cast
[21:12] isaacs: tbranyen: you can do *some* things with them
[21:12] isaacs: tbranyen: not all casts are to object
[21:12] isaacs: tbranyen: for instance:
[21:12] isaacs: v8: 8 + "7"
[21:12] v8bot: isaacs: "87"
[21:12] isaacs: v8: 8 + (+7)
[21:12] v8bot: isaacs: 15
[21:12] isaacs: v8: 8 + (+"7")
[21:12] v8bot: isaacs: 15
[21:12] isaacs: lots of casts and operations that are just between primitives
[21:12] jetienne: v8: 8 + "09"
[21:12] v8bot: jetienne: "809"
[21:12] isaacs: v8: !!0 instanceof Object
[21:12] pz_f: ^The f is was that ... hah
[21:12] v8bot: isaacs: false
[21:12] jetienne: v8: 8 + "07"
[21:13] v8bot: jetienne: "807"
[21:13] jetienne: v8: 8 + "7"
[21:13] v8bot: jetienne: "87"
[21:13] tbranyen: isaacs: if you eff with the String.valueOf and then do that +"15" cast wonder if it would screw up
[21:13] tbranyen: er prototype valueOf
[21:13] isaacs: v8: String.prototype.valueOf = function () { return 10000 }; 8 + (+"7")
[21:13] v8bot: isaacs: 15
[21:13] isaacs: nope.
[21:13] isaacs: v8: String.prototype.valueOf = function () { return 10000 }; 8 + (+new String("7"))
[21:13] v8bot: isaacs: 10008
[21:13] Ian_Corne has joined the channel

[21:14] isaacs: +string is a direct cast from a string primitive to a number primitive.
[21:14] jetienne: v8: ",,," == new Array(4);
[21:14] v8bot: jetienne: true
[21:14] isaacs: +new String() calls the String#valueOf
[21:14] tbranyen: interesting
[21:14] tbranyen: yeah
[21:14] isaacs: jetienne: yeah, casting to string is super high priority for some reason
[21:14] isaacs: v8: new Array(4) == ",,,"
[21:14] v8bot: isaacs: true
[21:15] isaacs: no one ever said JS was sane.  that's why it's so important to understand its quirks, since they make not a lot of sense.  that's why w3schools is the most evil thing in software.
[21:15] isaacs: seriously, i have a lot of disdain for that site.  if the owners had any shred of decency, they'd just take it down.
[21:15] mscdex: v8: ie-754
[21:15] v8bot: mscdex: ReferenceError: ie is not defined
[21:15] pz_f: Well it was nice to read all of this
[21:15] mscdex: heh
[21:16] isaacs: pz_f: :)
[21:16] tbranyen: isaacs: heh good thing they do more than js
[21:16] tbranyen: hard to find a better resource for quick css at the top of google
[21:16] pz_f: I still don't know what I should do though
[21:16] isaacs: tbranyen: no, it's bad!  they do DAMAGE to more than js!
[21:16] mscdex: v8: typeof NaN
[21:16] v8bot: mscdex: "number"
[21:16] mscdex: :P
[21:16] isaacs: tbranyen: css has just as many quirks as js, probably more, and w3schools gets THOSE wrong, too!
[21:16] davidascher has joined the channel
[21:16] tbranyen: isaacs: i was part of the w3fools movement thing, but! i can't deny i use it for css occasionally
[21:16] isaacs: just don't trust it.
[21:16] isaacs: check everything they say.
[21:17] tbranyen: well yea
[21:17] littke has joined the channel
[21:17] pz_f: They try explaining in an over-simplistic matter so it's bound to skip things
[21:17] isaacs: after doing that for a while, i realized that, since i had to check what w3schools said anyway, i was better off just not going there.
[21:17] isaacs: and investigating myself
[21:17] kixxauth: v8: (function () { return 2 + 2; }).toString()
[21:17] v8bot: kixxauth: "function () { return 2 + 2; }"
[21:17] isaacs: pz_f: no, more often than not, they don't skip over things, they cover them with a huge amount of incorrect information.
[21:17] kixxauth: ^^ Try that in spider monkey
[21:17] tbranyen: yeah was just gonna say kixxauth 
[21:18] tbranyen: you can't trust toString on functions since it differs per implementation
[21:18] isaacs: pz_f: if you tried really hard to do significant damage to the global understanding of webdev technology, you'd have a hard time doing a better job than w3schools has done.
[21:18] tbranyen: kixxauth: and toSource doesn't help either
[21:18] isaacs: they're doing active harm.
[21:18] mscdex: v8: 9999999999999999
[21:18] v8bot: mscdex: 10000000000000000
[21:18] kixxauth: you'll get "function () { return 4; }"
[21:18] mscdex: :P
[21:18] tbranyen: kixxauth: yes spidermonkey optimizes
[21:18] pz_f: isaacs: I see you hate them with a passion
[21:19] jetienne: mscdex: but this one is true in all languages
[21:19] pz_f: isaacs: How about proposing me a route for my issue with such vigor please :)
[21:19] isaacs: pz_f: read the ES5 spec.
[21:19] tbranyen: ha... oh god
[21:19] isaacs: pz_f: seriously, it's not as intimidating as it seems, and you'll learn a lot, even if you dont' retain it all at once, you'll remember where things are defined.
[21:19] isaacs: same with the CSS spec.
[21:19] tbranyen: you aren't anybody in the js community unless you've read the es5 spec
[21:19] isaacs: once you get past the definitions and crap, it's very straightforward.

[21:20] isaacs: a requirement for graduation in a modern information-age society
[21:20] pz_f: isaacs: I will read it, but can you answer me on this:
[21:20] pz_f: Ok so how should I proceed? Let's say I have a simple array that changes depending on connections and disconnections and that I want to display it in a page?
[21:20] tbranyen: isaacs: heh i should have known about the function reference, so perhaps i should read it as well
[21:21] isaacs: ok
[21:21] pz_f: I'm pushing usernames down an array and I want to display it's content on the page
[21:21] isaacs: res.write(JSON.stringify(theArrayOfStuff)) ?
[21:21] tbranyen: well he's using socket.io
[21:21] isaacs: oh, ok
[21:21] tbranyen: so you'd want to iterate an array of clients and send the array
[21:22] tbranyen: it'll auto stringify
[21:22] mscdex: better hope your array of clients doesn't get very big
[21:22] mscdex: :p
[21:22] isaacs: well, it'll JSONs stringify, and then parse it on the client
[21:22] pz_f: What if it does?
[21:22] tbranyen: right
[21:22] mscdex: deleting from big arrays can be slow
[21:22] pz_f: Yeah but I think db access would be slower?
[21:22] muhqu has joined the channel
[21:22] Phyllio has joined the channel
[21:22] isaacs: pz_f: why are you using an array for this?  why not an object with a key for each client?
[21:23] mscdex: at least use a linked list if nothing else
[21:23] mscdex: :p
[21:23] isaacs: or, if you have to get super fancy, a linked list or something, but that's way more complicated :)
[21:23] mscdex: nah
[21:23] pz_f: isaacs: Well I come from perl and QT and I started doing js a few days ago so I'm glad you propose me a more sensible way of proceeding
[21:23] mscdex: linked list is easy
[21:23] isaacs: honestly, i'd recommend doing it with an array first, then when it matters, doing it with an object or linked list or something
[21:24] mscdex: or you could go all out and use a b+tree!
[21:24] isaacs: you have to feel pain to understand why it's painful :)
[21:24] mscdex: :D
[21:24] pz_f: I have coded a linkedlist in c++ with pointers
[21:24] brianloveswords has joined the channel
[21:24] tbranyen: use javascript generators if you wanna be even more dope

[21:25] mscdex: var node = function(data) { this.next = null; this.data = data; }
[21:25] mscdex: then create new instances of node and assign .next as necessary
[21:25] mscdex: bam
[21:25] tbranyen: does v8 even have generators/iterators?
[21:25] tbranyen: i know its js 1.7
[21:26] pz_f: tbranyen: Ok so the array I will send, I will use socket's send() method to do it?
[21:26] tbranyen: yea
[21:26] pz_f: tbranyen: Cause the thing is
[21:26] pz_f: tbranyen: I'm starting to have a lot of code in the on.('message') listener
[21:26] tbranyen: break it out into functions or something then
[21:27] pz_f: Ok so everything really gets piped inside that send method huh...
[21:27] pz_f: Thought I could create my own events
[21:27] tbranyen: its a sugarcoated socket
[21:27] tbranyen: you get send/receive
[21:28] tbranyen: you should be able to write your own wrappers to make it flexible
