[00:00] perezd: thats standard ubuntu 10.04 
[00:00] bnoordhuis: perezd: yeah, i run that too
[00:00] bnoordhuis: i take it you have libssl-dev installed?
[00:00] mscdex: according to google it may have to do with server certificates
[00:01] bnoordhuis: yeah, it's the error openssl raises if a cert doesn't validate
[00:01] mscdex: :S
[00:01] perezd: yeah we have that
[00:01] bnoordhuis: but with a properly configured libssl you get an actual error message :)
[00:01] chjj: latest version of the libssl-dev package seems to work for me
[00:01] mscdex: is there a test for this?
[00:01] mscdex: in node?
[00:01] perezd: it happens to me randomly
[00:01] bnoordhuis: mscdex: for what specifically?
[00:02] perezd: I'm not even certain what causes it 
[00:02] perezd: exactly
[00:02] mscdex: bnoordhuis: for checking that a useful error is given when the server cert isn't validated?
[00:02] bnoordhuis: mscdex: no

[00:04] perezd: is that why? :)
[00:05] bnoordhuis: perezd: it's usually one of two things

[00:05] bnoordhuis: perezd: or an outdated root cert store

[01:24] krillr: ok, here's a question for you all
[01:24] krillr: how the heck can you make an event handler know what its parent object is
[01:24] krillr: here's the context: i have object A which has a function "eventHandler"
[01:25] krillr: it wants to listen to object B's "test" emission, and do some action on object A AND object B
[01:25] krillr: during emission "this" becomes the emitter, i lose all reference to the receiving object
[01:25] krillr: how do i fix this?
[01:25] AvianFlu: do you know about .call() ?
[01:25] AvianFlu: and/or .apply() ?
[01:25] krillr: i know of .call() but im unsure how that would apply here. and im unfamilair with .apply()
[01:26] AvianFlu: so let's say you have objOne and objTwo
[01:26] softdrink1 has joined the channel
[01:27] AvianFlu: let's also say you have objOne.fnOne
[01:27] akshatj has joined the channel
[01:27] AvianFlu: you can do objTwo.call(objOne.fnOne, args)

[01:27] AvianFlu: and the method will act like it's a member of the object you used .call on
[01:27] abraxas has joined the channel
[01:28] AvianFlu: so I figure name your event listeners, and you can just use .call as a fix
[01:28] AvianFlu: unless I'm misunderstanding you
[01:28] thepatr1ck: you can also do objOne.fnOne.bind(objOne) to get a function that has this = objOne
[01:28] krillr: here, let me pastebin an example of what i wish to do
[01:28] nphyx: an event handler function doesn't really have a parent object in a real sense, the "parent" object just has the function
[01:29] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[01:29] krillr: the "parent" object is a class in this case, i want to perform operations on that class
[01:29] thepatr1ck: krillr: are you familiar with .bind() ? 
[01:29] krillr: indeed, but in a moment ill demonstrate how these solutions dont work. give me one sec
[01:29] nphyx: On the class? Like, the prototype? You might be able to iterate through all the properties of all the objects in the global space and match them against the function or something like that but it would be horrible to do

[01:31] nphyx: problem more or less is trying to map class-based inheritance to prototype based inheritance, it doesn't quite work 1:1. is there a way you can refactor your code so that this need goes away?

[01:32] krillr: here's what im trying to achieve
[01:33] krillr: er, oens ec
[01:33] jmoyers: a.on('test', b.eventHandler); -- so in this case
[01:33] jmoyers: what do you want `this` to refer to?
[01:34] krillr: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/450941/ fixed
[01:34] krillr: jmoyers, "this" should refer to b
[01:34] Dmwuw has joined the channel
[01:35] nphyx: you could put your callbacks in a closure with a self-referencing var, maybe? e.g. b.callback = function() {var firstClass = this; var foo = function() {... callback stuff...}; return foo;}
[01:36] nphyx: then inside foo firstClass should refer to b, or whatever. sorry to swap your conventions around.
[01:36] krillr: ACTION screams
[01:36] krillr: lol
[01:37] krillr: trouble is
[01:37] krillr: i dont want to have to know who the emitter or listener is
[01:37] krillr: what class they're from
[01:37] krillr: it should "just work"
[01:37] jmoyers: nah nah
[01:38] jmoyers: here
[01:38] jmoyers: b.eventHandler.bind(b)
[01:38] jmoyers: simple
[01:38] jmoyers: no retarded closures needed
[01:38] nphyx: but then you lose a, jmoyers
[01:38] nphyx: retarded closures haha : )
[01:38] jerrysv has joined the channel
[01:39] jmoyers: he said `this` should refer to b

[01:39] Swimming_bird has joined the channel
[01:40] jmoyers: if you need to know who emitted
[01:40] nphyx: <krillr> it wants to listen to object B's "test" emission, and do some action on object A AND object B
[01:40] nphyx: <krillr> during emission "this" becomes the emitter, i lose all reference to the receiving object
[01:40] jmoyers: i'd make the sig function(emitter, payload){}
[01:40] jmoyers: yes, so with bind, this is preserved as the listener

[01:41] krillr: can you reply to my paste with a working example?
[01:41] jmoyers: no?
[01:41] nphyx: actually here's the problem: a.on('test', b.eventHandler); b.eventHandler is losing its context

[01:42] Anton_ has joined the channel
[01:42] jmoyers: yes, yes it is

[01:42] AvianFlu: you're both right
[01:42] nphyx: b.eventHandler's sig becomes function eventHandler(emitter) { ... this.doStuffTo(emitter)}

[06:30] ckknight: oh?
[06:30] __directory: !
[06:32] der|: yeah
[06:32] der|: I come from PHP, and I don't quite like the current methods, so I made node behave exactly like PHP & Apache
[06:32] der|: you can mix real code & presentation
[06:33] tbranyen: wat
[06:33] der|: for example:  http://paste.pocoo.org/show/451040/
[06:33] tbranyen: der|: you are aware of the other template engines that do that right?
[06:33] tbranyen: there are tons of those

[06:33] tbranyen: for fun?
[06:34] der|: not really, can you execute real js code inside the templates ?
[06:34] tbranyen: yes.
[06:34] der|: with dust.js ?
[06:34] der|: let's see heh
[06:34] Nuck: Hurrah! Got a gitolite set up without a single kink this time.
[06:35] tbranyen: underscore templates, ejs, that new one jon neal made
[06:35] der|: nope, dust.js does not do what mine does heh
[06:35] der|: you have to use {} for vars
[06:35] der|: this one behaves exactly like php
[06:35] tbranyen: well thats a deal breaker
[06:35] tbranyen: except the fact that its not php
[06:35] der|: I mean, if you come from php, it will be painless
[06:36] der|: it's still js, but you use similar escapes. In this case:  <? ?>
[06:36] tbranyen: nearly all template engines that don't suck allow you to customize those
[06:36] __directory: hmm
[06:37] Nuck: EJS
[06:37] der|: I'm not talking about customization per se, the open/close tags are irrelevant
[06:37] Nuck: Great for PHP
[06:37] Nuck: Well, ex-PHP users
[06:37] der|: Nuck: exactly :)
[06:37] Nuck: I love EJS because it provides all the simplicity of PHP combined with the awesomeness of JS

[08:20] japj: ryah: for c++ modules on windows the big problem is probably not having a real 'eco-system' like all the unix'es/mac have. there is no central installation destination for libraries and such. so if someone were to build a c++ addon that depends on  a third party lib, where are you going to find the include/lib files? it is not really a "node" problem, but definately something that is going...
[08:20] japj: ...to be painfull on windows I think

[10:56] tmedema: while the pipe is in progress
[10:56] TheJH: tmedema, when exactly do you want to switch
[10:56] TheJH: ?
[10:57] tmedema: TheJH: after having setup the piping from A to C, while it is going on
[10:57] tmedema: somewhere inbetween that process I will get information that may or may not make me want to bypass it to stream C
[11:00] TheJH: tmedema, would it be ok to close B in that case?
[11:00] luke`_ has joined the channel
[11:00] tmedema: TheJH: hmm, if necessary, I guess.. but it could cause some unexpected behavior
[11:00] tmedema: is that really necessary? it seems unrelated
[11:02] markwubben has joined the channel
[11:02] TheJH: tmedema, as there doesn't seem to be a way to cleanly cancel a pipe() operation, I'd have suggested to do something like "b.emit('end')"
[11:03] tmedema: TheJH: hmm, alright, so if I end stream B then the piping process will stop gracefully?
[11:04] TheJH: tmedema, looks that way

[11:05] TheJH: tmedema, you can see it yourself at https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/stream.js
[11:05] tmedema: sounds like there is a need of change in API that allows for more control over the piping process though
[11:05] TheJH: tmedema, sounds like a good task for a module. want to write one?
[11:07] tmedema: TheJH: actually need to work on a deadline, but if it doesn't involve C then I may work on it later

[11:23] tmedema: How does one check if a writable stream is ready for writing (the kernell buffer is empty) without actually writing?
[11:25] TheJH: tmedema, you keep track of the results of "write" and the "drain" event
[11:26] tmedema: TheJH: right so I have to register my own boolean and listen for the drain event? I cannot listen to write's returns since I do not call write myself (other libraries do)

[11:27] asabil has joined the channel
[11:27] tmedema: or actually, nevermind that
[11:27] tmedema: I give them the stream (a writable stream)
[11:29] tmedema: I guess I could wrap the write function.. seems rather ugly though.
[11:29] gavin_huang has joined the channel
[11:29] MonsieurLu has joined the channel
[11:30] TheJH: tmedema, this is somehow ugly, but it should work: `var write = myStream.write; myStream.write = function() { return this.ready = write.apply(this, arguments); }`
[11:30] fyskij has joined the channel
[11:30] tmedema: TheJH: yeah, that's what I mentioned too
[11:30] tmedema: will do, seems like the streaming API is a bit narrow
[11:31] TheJH: tmedema, ah, ok. just make sure that you really only do it on the instance and not on the prototype.
[11:31] fairwinds has joined the channel
[11:32] tmedema: TheJH: by the way I do not think you need to save myStream.write in write. Inside the function the write method will not have been overwritten, yet.
[11:32] svenlito has joined the channel
[11:32] tmedema: myStream.write = function() { return this.ready = myStream.write.apply(this, arguments); }
[11:32] TheJH: tmedema, I think that you're wrong there - when the method gets called, the property already was overwritten
[11:33] TheJH: tmedema, that one's gonna give you endless recursion
[11:33] tmedema: TheJH: ah of course, I wasn't thinking right.. sorry & thanks

[12:31] hvgotcodes: japj: javascript, in the server
[12:31] TheJH: hvgotcodes, I think that you want workers
[12:31] TheJH: !npm search worker
[12:31] tuhoojabotti: Yeah
[12:31] hvgotcodes: so one solution is to create a child process, but this is running in the node.js code itself
[12:31] jhbot: packages (short format): beanstalk_worker, worker, resque, jjw, worker-pool, spawn, gearman, q-comm, webworker, gearnode, factory-worker, cluster-isolatable, kue, fibers
[12:31] hvgotcodes: TheJH: its a module, no native support?

[12:34] topaxi has joined the channel
[12:34] hvgotcodes: is there a child process method that fires a js function that is defined in the server?
[12:34] TheJH: !npm search webworker

[12:36] hvgotcodes: TheJH: is that for running background threads on the node server?
[12:36] TheJH: hvgotcodes, how does "var w = new Worker('foo.js');" look to you?
[12:36] hvgotcodes: TheJH: not ideal, id like to define the function in the server itself
[12:37] TheJH: hvgotcodes, you can't really execute a function in the background, but you can start a worker and exchange messages with it
[12:37] fumanchu182 has joined the channel
[12:37] hvgotcodes: how about instead of exchaning messages, callbacks get executed on success/fail?
[12:38] TheJH: hvgotcodes, I'd say that that's kind of a message
[12:38] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[12:38] hvgotcodes: true
[12:38] TheJH: hvgotcodes, have a look at https://github.com/pgriess/node-webworker
[12:38] nail_: there is child_process.fork that is a bit like web workers
[12:39] nail_: you can trigger functions on the parent on specific messages
[12:39] nail_: oh wait, the parent can send messages to the child, not sure if it works the other way
[12:39] TheJH: nail_, I don't think that that function exists
[12:39] hvgotcodes: TheJH: yeah i was going over that
[12:39] nail_: TheJH: it's in 0.5
[12:40] nail_: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.5.3/api/child_processes.html#child_process.fork

[12:41] japj: 0.5 is unstable
[12:41] nail_: it's "latest stable" probably :)
[12:41] TheJH: nail_, maybe

[12:41] hvgotcodes: yeah latest stable
[12:41] japj: there is an issue on github related to that aswell
[12:41] hvgotcodes: plus, the fork method does not support just a function with some callbacks
[12:41] hvgotcodes: so its no simpler than web worker
[12:42] TheJH: !issue search latest nodejs

[13:03] TheJH: shanebo, they block everything
[13:03] shanebo: TheJH, is this a no no?
[13:04] TheJH: shanebo, depends on your usecase. if you want to load a configuration file on startup, you can do it, but you can imagine that using it in a file server or so is one of the worst things you could do
[13:05] TheJH: shanebo, basically, it's ok for everything that only happens once on startup or so, but for everything else, use async methods
[13:05] shanebo: TheJH so if someone hits the site while a sync method is active, they just get added to the queue right?

[13:06] shanebo: okay good, I'm considering using it on startup of simple flat file json loads at start
[13:06] TheJH: shanebo, yes, their request will not be handled until the sync method has finished

[13:18] simenbrekken: Will node search multiple levels of node_modules folders? I'm having an issue where I have a node_modules folder which contains a module that requires another module that's 3 levels up in another node_modules folder and it can't be located.
[13:19] theCole has joined the channel
[13:20] TheJH: simenbrekken, your module that requires the other module should have it in its own node_modules folder, too
[13:20] simenbrekken: I think I might have used the node_modules folder for application libaries
[13:21] TheJH: simenbrekken, what does "npm ls" say?
[13:21] simenbrekken: TheJH: I get a ton of unmet dependencies warnings
[13:22] TheJH: simenbrekken, what does "npm install" without arguments say?
[13:22] simenbrekken: TheJH: in what directoy should I be running this
[13:23] TheJH: simenbrekken, in the root folder of your project which contains a node_modules folder
[13:23] simenbrekken: TheJH: I'm on EC2 atm which has a bit of a strange setup so I have a node_modules in my home directory with stuff like mongodb etc. and then an application/node_modules with application specific stuff
[13:24] TheJH: simenbrekken, which npm version are you running?
[13:24] simenbrekken: 1.0.15
[13:24] TheJH: simenbrekken, run it in the same folder in which you also ran "npm ls"

[16:13] isaacs: is there a 0.1 in there that should be "0.1" (with quotes)
[16:13] isaacs: maybe in the dependencies hash?
[16:13] Aikar: was nothing, then i tried an npm init and that didnt work either
[16:13] isaacs: maybe, "express": 0.1
[16:13] Aikar: installing to a diff dir works

[16:14] isaacs: if installing in another dir DOES work, then there's something really strange going on

[16:22] isaacs: Aikar: so, you want npm to leave behind the ./node_modules/foo/lib/blah/.svn?
[16:22] isaacs: no way

[16:23] isaacs: ugh, no
[16:23] isaacs: can't do that.
[16:24] Aikar: :(
[16:24] isaacs: sorry, it's just too awful, for too little benefit.  i'd recommend putting your node_modules in .svnignore and then managing them separately

[17:11] Aikar: requiring to use npm to install when deploying to production is bad

[17:11] Aikar: npm wont be installed on my prod servers
[17:11] Aikar: why should it be?
[17:11] TheJH: Aikar, when your dependencies get updated, you'll have to make a "deps update commit" or something like that
[17:11] Aikar: and?
[17:11] isaacs: Aikar: i agree with you
[17:11] Aikar: thats extremely common
[17:12] isaacs: add your deps to bundleDependencies, and then do `npm package` and you've got a tarball.
[17:12] isaacs: Aikar: shasum it, put it on a dist server, whatever.
[17:12] Aikar: i use npm as a way to get and update modules in order to commit to my projects repo.
[17:13] Aikar: TheJH: and for the reason i just encountered mainly. I commited updated modules, then checked out on another location, and i was missing a ton of dependencies

[17:22] mpavel has left the channel
[17:23] mbrevoort: isaacs: let me try
[17:23] Aikar: isaacs: works fine for me on svn, the file structure you want in prod is pretty much what is in your VCS system. I use npm solely as a way of installing and updating modules. its non existent when it comes to deploying.. update modules, commit changes (which was my problem i used git-svn to solve since .svn dirs getting deleted blows stuff up)
[17:23] isaacs: i see
[17:23] isaacs: sure, that sounds like an ok workaround
[17:24] isaacs: Aikar: another solution is to *not* check your deps into your vcs, but install them locally, and list them in your `bundleDependencies`.  Then, for deployment, on your dev box do `npm pack`.  This will create a tarball containing your code and all your deps.  put that in places.
[17:24] hebz0rl has joined the channel
[17:24] isaacs: with that, you can then get a shasum, do a git/svn tag, etc.
[17:25] zeiris has joined the channel
[17:25] isaacs: you can even take that tarball and install it with npm on your target machine, but in such a way that there's no registry whatevers, since everything is bundled.
[17:25] isaacs: or just rsync and unpack it.
[17:26] kjeldahl_ has joined the channel
[17:28] Aikar: isaacs: i really dont see the gain, id rather have the source in a pristine state you know works. what if NPM registry is down when you go to deploy? or what if internet access is down at work but internal network stuff still works. that kind of stuff would block you. when you could just host it in your own VCS and it should 'just work'

[18:01] nnnnathann1: hello.  I'm pretty new to lower-level type networking things.  I am curious as to whether or not you guys think it would be possible to make serving a sequence of static images more efficient using node explicitly for the purpose of reducing the number of requests necessary...
[18:02] jobim: I have a beginner question if someone has a moment. I'm reading the example at the top of page 21 in Hands-On Node.js at http://nodetuts.com/pdf/handson-nodejs-sample.pdf 
[18:02] Determinist: nnnnathann1: what's wrong with spriting? is the client HTML?
[18:03] TheJH: nnnnathann1, for just serving static stuff, node isn't the fastest thing that exists, have a look at gatling and nginx
[18:03] jobim: On line 15, the timeout parameter is passed to the start function, but in the declaration it takes no such parameter. How is that possible?
[18:04] nnnnathann1: Determinist: spriting is not possible due to the nature of the images, they are (relatively) high-res and number in the hundreds (an image sequence)
[18:04] nnnnathann1: TheJH: thanks, I will take a look at those
[18:04] TheJH: jobim, looks like a mistake
[18:04] jobim: That's what I thought too.
[18:04] Tobsn: mornin
[18:04] jobim: I'm new to JS but couldn't figure out a way that was possible.
[18:04] kriszyp has joined the channel
[18:05] TheJH: nnnnathann1, gatling is crazy fast and small while nginx is (afaik) a little bit slower but has more features
[18:05] Determinist: nnnnathann1: and how did you think of doing that then? i mean, if you're going to load up hunders of images, your problem is not the format of how you're transferring them but the kind of load you're putting on the client DOM. again, assuming we're talking about a browser client.
[18:05] erictj has left the channel
[18:05] hij1nx has joined the channel
[18:06] nnnnathann1: Determinist, indeed, but I don't actually load them into the DOM (display tree).  The efficiency is very nice once they have loaded, but loading them images request after request makes it very slow at the start.
[18:06] Determinist: nnnnathann1: sorry, but again, are we talking about a browser here? display tree sounds flashy :P
[18:06] nnnnathann1: Determinist, I was thinking that maybe I could use node to combine the files data server side and transmit it in a single request, then parse on the other side?
[18:07] nnnnathann1: Determinist, no I just meant I don't display the images, it's all in JS
[18:07] nnnnathann1: TheJH, I haven't even heard of gatling, that sounds interesting
[18:07] Determinist: nnnnathann1: ah. well, if you don't mind letting go of old browsers, you could use base64 to combine images into a long ass string and then reparse on the browser.
[18:07] nnnnathann1: Determinist, yeah I took a look at that but I have to support back to IE7 :\
[18:08] Determinist: nnnnathann1: i feel ya brother.
[18:08] Determinist: nnnnathann1: keep alive connection?
[18:08] Determinist: not gonna help tho.
[18:08] nnnnathann1: Determinist, being a rookie, I got excited about that type of thing... that's mainly why I was asking about it
[18:09] nnnnathann1: Determinist, sounds like I would have to send the requests anyway though?
[18:09] Determinist: yeah, exciting and all, but you still have a problem with support on the browser. IE7 being the problem, mostly.

[19:32] cconstantine: odie5533, is that why you're asking about windows?  I honestly see no reason to run node on windows but I"m fairly biased.

[19:32] Aikar: >>> node app.js info  - socket.io started info  - unable to listen to port `843` as your node.js instance does not have root privileges. the flash policy file requests will only be served inline over the supplied http server. inline serving is slower than a dedicated server instance.

[20:04] isaacs: indutny: there is no way that i'd ever be as good a couch host as iriscouch.  *maybe* if i made it my full-time job, but since Jason already made it his, that's a bit silly.

[20:17] ryah: ale: hey
[20:18] ale: Just a quick question
[20:18] ryah: ale: shoot!
[20:18] ale: If I use express then, I'll need to create an HTTP server, therefore if I have 99999999 connections, everything will collapse..am I right?
[20:18] ale: The thing is that I want to get the url params, and I found out that the only way is with expressjs, am I right?
[20:19] ryah: it's not possible to have 99999999 connections, no
[20:19] ale: but with node and socketio yes!
[20:19] heavysixer has joined the channel
[20:19] ryah: you can get at them by manually parsing req.url
[20:20] bshumate has joined the channel
[20:20] ryah: but probably you should use express
[20:20] jerrysv: bricks
[20:20] toxico has joined the channel
[20:20] ale: but if I use express I won't be able to have that many connections as if I don't use it!

[20:21] ale: jerrysv: does it use http?
[20:21] jerrysv: ale: yes
[20:21] indutny: ale: 10^8 -1 is too much even for node.js
[20:21] ale: then how does facebook do to manage the connections?
[20:22] indutny: horizontal scaling, I suppose?
[20:22] tjholowaychuk: ale huh ? lol what does express have to do with limiting connections
[20:22] indutny: running multiple instances
[20:22] indutny: lets assume 1 connection = 1 kb memory
[20:22] indutny: 10 ^ 11 bytes of memory
[20:22] ale: because express uses http and http creates threads
[20:22] tjholowaychuk: lol
[20:22] jerrysv: um, what?
[20:22] tjholowaychuk: ACTION headdesk
[20:22] ale: and thread are limited
[20:23] ale: maybe I have this concept wrong?
[20:23] jerrysv: ale: um, i think you may have this concept wrong :)
[20:23] ryah: ale: the http module doesnt use threads
[20:23] jerrysv: i can understand people not wanting to use express for various reasons, but this is the first time i've heard that one :)
[20:23] adrianolaru has joined the channel
[20:24] ale: jerrysv: you know, every day you learn something new haha
[20:24] indutny: 10^8 requests
[20:24] ale: but when I call express I createServer()
[20:24] tjholowaychuk: haha yeah that's up there with other bad assumptions
[20:24] indutny: ryah: lets keep on going with optimizations
[20:24] ale: so what should I do?
[20:24] ale: indutny: 10‚Å∏ requests per second?
[20:24] jerrysv: ale: that just sets up the http socket and adds some events
[20:25] ale: jerrysv: so then I won't be limited by using expressjs? What's the difference with bricks?
[20:26] jerrysv: ale: it doesn't use connect, has multiple levels of routing, adds some nice event handling for the routes and errors
[20:26] ale: jerrysv: so in some way it's much better

[23:40] just_monkey_code: Is there a way to do this from within the module itself?  I know that you can create child processes and give them what ever stderr you would like, but is there a way that a module can control it's own stderr?

[23:51] just_monkey_code: no dice on process.stderr.on('data').  Per the docs the data event is only emitted on Readable streams ( the same issue with the pipe() method ).  stderr is only a Writeable stream.
[23:52] AvianFlu: oh yeah, cause it's not a child process
[23:52] AvianFlu: you could pipe it to a readable stream
[23:52] AvianFlu: and then use that stream's data event to send it wherever
[23:53] just_monkey_code: That's a good idea.  Let's give that a shot :) Thanks
[23:53] AvianFlu: but really, just send it somewhere else before you write it to stderr
