[00:31] xerox: is there a tutorial for putting a node.js project on github and avoid to put things like dependencies on,?
[00:32] TheJH: xerox, do you know ".gitignore"?
[00:33] TheJH: xerox, you can put a ".gitignore" file in your project folder. everything you mention there won't be included in your repo. so just put "node_modules" in it
[00:33] xerox: and then when one pulls it
[00:33] xerox: what does he do to create node_modules out of package.json?
[00:33] TheJH: xerox, here's more about gitignore: http://help.github.com/ignore-files/
[00:34] TheJH: xerox, he just does "npm install" and npm does magic
[00:34] igl: npm install -d
[00:34] xerox: excellent
[00:34] TheJH: xerox, npm will then read the package.json and install all dependencies mentioned in there
[00:34] TheJH: igl, I don't think that you need "-d"
[00:34] xerox: should I create the .gitignore before doing anything git-related
[00:34] xerox: now I just have a folder
[00:35] TheJH: xerox, it's probably a good idea
[00:35] xerox: perfect
[00:35] TooTallNate: isaacs: does `npm install -d` install the devDependencies or is it verbose output?
[00:35] TheJH: xerox, also see the github help page I linked to for global gitignore
[00:35] xerox: thanks : )

[01:01] opsdfposdfosdf: edit: only affects windows builds
[01:01] xerox: TooTallNate: hmm that doesn't do it (also npm help install does not bring up anything with 'save'?)
[01:02] TooTallNate: hhmhmm, I thought that was it, i'm pretty sure it's something undocumented/new
[01:03] xerox: TooTallNate: I just did npm init, and then created my files and npm install the various deps
[01:03] beriberikix: I'm almost out of Cygwin hell! http://twitpic.com/5u9eap
[01:03] xerox: ah I see TooTallNate thanks
[01:03] TooTallNate: xerox: https://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues/1054
[01:03] xerox: you mean install the deps with the --save
[01:03] xerox: so they get added
[01:04] xerox: excellent : )
[01:04] TooTallNate: supposedly it's in there
[01:04] xerox: and it works
[01:04] xerox: what does one usually put in for engine? >=0.4.10 ?
[01:05] TooTallNate: xerox: haha it wasn't working for me, but then I realized I was on 1.0.13, updating to 1.0.18 made it start working
[01:05] xerox: woo
[01:06] TooTallNate: xerox: for engine I would put:   "engines": { "node": "0.4.x || 0.5.x" }
[01:06] TooTallNate: maybe not 0.5.x
[01:06] smtlaissezfaire has joined the channel
[01:06] TooTallNate: but that's up to you
[01:06] xerox: all the packages I saw do support very "old" versions of node
[01:07] xerox: I'll keep >=0.4.10 so I know it works : )
[01:07] TooTallNate: but do *you* support old versions of node, for your module. that's the question
[01:07] Murvin: Friday!!!! finally..
[01:07] TooTallNate: don't say it's supported unless you're sure it is
[01:07] TooTallNate: :p
[01:07] xerox: yeah I don't
[01:07] xerox: so my choice makes sense doesn't it
[01:07] kasper1 has joined the channel
[01:08] TooTallNate: no, >= 0.4.10 means ANY version of node before or equal to 0.4.10
[01:08] TooTallNate: so even 0.0.1 of node
[01:08] TooTallNate: which the module probably won't work on :p
[01:08] TooTallNate: 0.4.x means any version of node in the 0.4 releases, so the API should be close to stable
[01:09] TooTallNate: oh, wait, other way around
[01:09] xerox: before?
[01:09] TooTallNate: so the module is saying that it works on node 0.5... and 0.6... and 0.7....
[01:09] xerox: >= should be after
[01:10] TooTallNate: right, i was backwards for a sec
[01:10] xerox: I see what you mean tho
[01:10] xerox: OK
[01:10] xerox: what is the tilde?
[01:10] TooTallNate: where?
[01:10] xerox: ~0.2.1

[01:45] Xano has joined the channel
[01:45] chjj: xerox: theres basically 3 that im aware of, showdown - unmaintained, messy, discount - nice, but you need a binding and have to compile it, and then markdown-js - i havent used it, all i know is my parser and lexer are about 1000 lines less right now
[01:45] patrickjst has joined the channel
[01:46] xerox: tbranyen: no sure I mean, if they do lack functionality I will know and when I need one I will know where to look for it

[01:47] slifty has joined the channel
[01:47] chjj: so you can easily compile a *huge* chunk of markdown without blocking for a small amount of time

[01:48] chjj: all the cool names are taken =/

[02:11] Xeon06_ has joined the channel
[02:11] tjholowaychuk: so I can't say how many people use it, but nearly everyone using connect or express uses it IF they serve files

[02:12] tjholowaychuk: and the reality is
[02:12] tjholowaychuk: node isn't that fast at serving files
[02:12] tjholowaychuk: so if that is your concern use nginx or varnish etc
[02:12] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: Hence why I use gninx X3
[02:12] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: have you seen that in production?
[02:12] shanebo: does nginx bottle neck compared to using node as the static server?
[02:12] tjholowaychuk: tbranyen seen what?
[02:12] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: node being noticably slow at serving static files
[02:12] tjholowaychuk: we serve our assets with a CDN

[02:19] shanebo: i'm sure it's all great and needed at some point, but I'd rather start extremely thin

[02:59] mnaser: like, code an application that can parse the httpd.conf and host virtual hosts like it does
[02:59] mnaser: why does it sound like a terrible idea?
[02:59] jesusabdullah: because apache is huge, and optimized for what it does
[02:59] luke` has joined the channel
[03:00] jesusabdullah: Being to parse an httpd.conf and do some intelligent things with it might not be a terrible idea
[03:00] SubStack: mnaser: https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy
[03:00] jesusabdullah: but if you did the whole shebang, what's the point? You might as well use apache
[03:00] jesusabdullah: since it's moar fasters anyway
[03:00] mnaser: because apache is really heavy on ram, we do virtual hosting (and all the shebang if you might say) and it has a huge memory footprint
[03:01] jesusabdullah: So you think node wouldn't?
[03:01] jesusabdullah: with all the same functionalit?
[03:01] jesusabdullah: functionality*
[03:01] jesusabdullah: What might be a good idea is taking an httpd.conf and mashing it together with node-http-proxy or some particular thing, in order to make migration easier
[03:01] mnaser: well that's the thing
[03:02] SubStack: just write a script that converts httpd.confs to json and another script that reads those jsons to fire up servers with node-http-proxy
[03:02] mnaser: i don't need a trillion features
[03:02] SubStack: gogogo
[03:02] mnaser: there's a huge overhead of running apache that just don't need/use
[03:02] jesusabdullah: In that case, you don't want to reimplement apache, you just want to be able to parse httpd.confs for the purposes of running an alternate solution
[03:02] jesusabdullah: and that's probably not a bad idea
[03:02] mnaser: yeah, that's what i want to do
[03:02] jesusabdullah: SubStack's suggestion is probably a good one---look into something that converts httpd.confs into, say, configs for haibu
[03:03] jesusabdullah: which are probably in json
[03:03] mnaser: the management software does virtual host management so it can be drop in, just reads the config file like apache does and runs an http server
[03:03] mnaser: then again there's somethings I'm not sure.. like we use suphp, so how that would work out
[03:03] mnaser: but i can see the potential for a lightweight server
[03:03] jesusabdullah: Why not try lighttpd or nginx?
[03:04] jesusabdullah: I mean, if a more traditional server but moar fasters and less bloated, is what you want
[03:04] Me1000 has joined the channel
[03:04] mnaser: hmm, one of the things that bothered me was .htaccess files with nginx
[03:04] mnaser: it wouldn't be that hard to reimplement .htaccess parsing with our basic functionality
[03:04] jesusabdullah: What about lighttpd?
[03:04] mnaser: versus making a whole module of nginx/etc
[03:04] mnaser: lighttpd doesn't support .htaccess me thinks?
[03:05] jesusabdullah: What's .htaccess, and why can't you use another solution to do the same?
[03:05] jesusabdullah: I'm not trying to grill you by the way
[03:05] mnaser: no problem, i understand
[03:05] jesusabdullah: I feel like it sounds that way
[03:05] mnaser: we do shared hosting -- people are standardized and are just used to using .htaccess files to make modfications
[03:05] mnaser: like for example, mod_rewrite
[03:05] eastender has joined the channel
[03:05] jesusabdullah: Well
[03:06] pHcF has joined the channel
[03:06] jhbot has joined the channel
[03:06] mnaser: which is like the rewrites in nginx, they can write it up in a .htaccess file and it's done .. being a very large company, we minimize support by making it compatible
[03:06] pHcF: hi, i have a telnet socket
[03:06] mnaser: if we have a huge infrastructure change, everyone and their uncle can't setup pretty urls in apache, and then we ht the pooper
[03:06] jesusabdullah: but what's a .htaccess file?
[03:06] pHcF: when the client sends Control + C, i can't write to the socket anymore. why is that?
[03:07] mnaser: jesusabdullah: think of it as an extension of the apache configuration that virtual host users can make
[03:07] Aria: It is. 
[03:07] _jhs has joined the channel
[03:07] mnaser: for example, i want to make some rewrites, i don't have access to the httpd.conf because i'm just a virtual user
[03:07] jesusabdullah: That sounds like expected behavior to me, pHcF. I haven't really played with telnet, but that's a "stop doing things" command on the shell
[03:07] Aria: Limited in the directives it'll accept -- only those that make sense post path-translation -- but a piece of Apache config.
[03:07] rex_fernando has joined the channel
[03:07] mnaser: i stick those changes in my .htaccess file and i can override the default behaviour without having to change the main config
[03:07] pHcF: hmm.. ok
[03:08] Aria: pHcF: the question is, what's the user really sending? Is it an ascii \003? That's what control-C is in raw mode.
[03:08] isaacs has joined the channel
[03:08] jesusabdullah: Well, mnaser
[03:08] Aria: But lots of client software cooks that in various ways.
[03:08] pHcF: Aria: nope, it's not
[03:08] Aria: Hm. What's the client?
[03:09] jhbot has joined the channel
[03:09] darshanshankar has joined the channel
[03:09] bentkus: what web framework can you guys recommend?
[03:09] jesusabdullah: idk mnaser, I see why you want to replace apache and yet still support these things, but it just sounds like a *lot* of work for not a lot of gain
[03:09] pHcF: Aria: mac 
[03:09] pHcF: Aria: i mean, mac's terminal telnet client
[03:10] Aria: Ah, okay, so classic unix telnet.
[03:10] mnaser: jesusabdullah: we do tons of in-house dev, i was just thinking of input on how it could work
[03:10] pHcF: 'i'm trying to socket.setEncoding('ascii'); but what's being sent doesn't change

[03:10] srid has joined the channel
[03:10] srid has joined the channel
[03:10] luke` has joined the channel
[03:10] mnaser: and we do tons of virtual hosting, aka, we can do 800 accounts a server right now
[03:10] Aria: socket.setEncoding won't affect what the client sends at all.
[03:10] mnaser: and they're very stable, but i know the servers got more potential
[03:10] jdiamond has left the channel
[03:10] pHcF: Aria: yep.. that makes sense
[03:10] SubStack: mnaser: is it just static content?
[03:10] Aria: bentkus: depends on what I'm doing, but express is awesome.
[03:11] SubStack: or is there icky phps and cgi scriptery
[03:11] jesusabdullah: bentkus: For framework-frameworks you might like express, or connect. Also check out dnode and browserify, though, and some of nodejitsu's libraries, if you're into anti-framework stuff
[03:11] mnaser: nope, static and php, but we use suphp so it wouldn't be hard to implement that
[03:11] mnaser: cgi as well is just an executable
[03:11] _jhs has left the channel
[03:11] Aria: pHcF: So why you can't write after a control-C is surprising.  telnet goes to raw mode very quickly after connecting (it handles control-c locally until then though)
[03:11] Aria: So it /should/ send \003
[03:11] jesusabdullah: bentkus: In fact, you can use most of these things together.
[03:11] SubStack: mnaser: there's already a cgi module on npm you could use
[03:11] SubStack: cgi             A stack/connect layer to invoke and serve CGI executables.    =TooTallNate       
[03:12] pHcF: Aria: weird.. in server I get characters like ����
[03:12] mnaser: i think suphp uses cgi-like behaviour
[03:12] mnaser: so there's a base there
[03:12] SubStack: could work then
[03:12] Aria: That makes sense. That's a unicode replacement for something unprintable. Control-C is definitely unprintable.
[03:12] cachemoney has joined the channel
[03:12] pHcF: yep
[03:12] mnaser: its a really interesting idea.. im really tempted to give it a shot
[03:12] jesusabdullah: That could actually be really cool mnaser, if you got something together that was really lightweight, could read apache config formats and gave you some cgi's
[03:13] jesusabdullah: If you do it, please2b eventually open source? :D
[03:13] jesusabdullah: Open sourcing things is pretty awesome!
[03:13] mnaser: i agree
[03:13] mnaser: i'm all with you
[03:13] mnaser: i
[03:13] jesusabdullah: \o/
[03:13] Aria: I'd be happy to help with a parser for htaccess files.
[03:13] pHcF: Aria: i need to stop a command started in telnet using the Control + C (like in a shell)
[03:13] SubStack: mnaser: call it geronimo
[03:13] mnaser: haha interseting name, why?
[03:13] davemo has joined the channel
[03:13] jesusabdullah: apache --> geronimo
[03:13] Aria: pHcF: "stop" in what sense? Shut down the socket, end the telnet session? Or stop doing something on the server in response to receiving that?
[03:13] mnaser: ahaha
[03:13] mnaser: omg
[03:13] mnaser: that is such a win name
[03:13] Aria: geronimo's taken.
[03:14] jesusabdullah: WHAT

[03:15] mnaser: you know what guys
[03:15] tbranyen: npm has a search?
[03:15] mnaser: i'll get the ball rolling on this
[03:15] mnaser: i really think it'll be good.. even if i don't have all the node.js talent right now
[03:15] mnaser: i do tons of ruby/python/etc .. just started node.js but i always coded javascript.. but just working with the language is the hard part, js server side sounds aah
[03:15] SubStack: isaacs: HOW FAST IS IT?
[03:16] jesusabdullah: You'll get the hang of it mnaser if you can handle all those things
[03:16] jesusabdullah: as long as you get callbacks, and do your homework
[03:16] isaacs: SubStack: it's SO FAST, it's already done!
[03:16] mnaser: i'm doing callbacks now, my biggest issue is code style
[03:16] jesusabdullah: js is actually REALLY AWESOME on the backend imo
[03:16] mnaser: i think my code looks gross now.
[03:16] jesusabdullah: Yeah, you'll get it
[03:16] SubStack: WOW THAT IS FAST I AM GOING TO npm install npm RIGHT NOW
[03:16] pHcF: Aria: stop doing something in the server
[03:16] isaacs: haha
[03:16] isaacs: SubStack: throw a -g on that noise
[03:17] SubStack: yes sir
[03:17] jesusabdullah: Holy shit that's really fast
[03:17] jesusabdullah: It finished BEFORE the npm colorsplash actually hit the screen
[03:17] mnaser: but yeah, i'm doing a node.js application that is using xmlrpc to make a lightweight remote apii
[03:17] Aria: Wow, that's awesome, isaacs.
[03:17] Aria: Fun, mnaser! A good place to start, even if XML is gross, dude.
[03:17] jesusabdullah: mnaser: if it's between node instances check out dnode

[03:18] jesusabdullah: SubStack: did you throw down some sudo?
[03:18] aaroninfidel: using express how can I pull json from twitter or some other resource and use it locally?
[03:18] Aria: You might try something json-based if you're not tied to XML
[03:18] Aria: It's so much easier to work with
[03:18] tbranyen: well especially in JS
[03:18] SubStack: jesusabdullah: pfft that's not how I roll
[03:18] jesusabdullah: i don't think your twittering is going to really be tied to express, aaroninfidel 
[03:18] TheJH: isaacs, why is it faster now? are you using the local cache instead of the db?
[03:18] jesusabdullah: SubStack: gurl

[03:20] jesusabdullah: I'll have some too, that sounds like a capital idea

[03:20] SubStack: FANCY THAT, TIME FOR TEA
[03:20] Aria: qbert_: Boston here. 102 and huuuumid.
[03:20] jesusabdullah: Oh, aaroninfidel, a module you should look into
[03:20] jesusabdullah: ntwitter
[03:20] pHcF: Aria: any idea?
[03:20] mnaser: SubStack: i just found dnode-ruby in your github
[03:20] mnaser: that might just make me get RPC out
[03:20] mnaser: :p
[03:20] aaroninfidel: jesusabdullah: I'm not interested in twitter, I was just using that as an example because they have a good API that uses JSON.
[03:21] SubStack: mnaser: that module could use some lovin' but it works at least
[03:21] jesusabdullah: aaroninfidel: Oh.
[03:21] SubStack: unlike dnode-python I might add!
[03:21] mnaser: SubStack: we'll leave it some love if we need anything ;)
[03:21] Aria: pHcF: Well, usually, with telnet proper, it goes through the kernel's tty interface, translating characters through the tty cooked mode. You'll have to emulate that. The short version? Watch for \003 and act on it.
[03:21] jesusabdullah: You shut your face python is hard alrite
[03:21] aaroninfidel: jesusabdullah: so, any other suggestions?
[03:21] jesusabdullah: aaroninfidel: thinking
[03:21] pHcF: Aria: ok, i'll try
[03:22] pHcF: hmm.. waiting for \003 didn't work
[03:22] SubStack: jesusabdullah: but it's just executable pseudocode!
[03:22] jeromegn has joined the channel
[03:22] jesusabdullah: Oh, okay, so with express, you would make a request, and in a middleware parse the payload. I've done some of this json parsing in the other direction before, I'll see if I can find the code
[03:22] jesusabdullah: SubStack: Have you ever seen anyone build anything useful out of pseudocode? No.
[03:22] aaroninfidel: jesusabdullah: ok thanks.

[03:23] jesusabdullah: Lucky for me, I started with python so I didn't know better
[03:24] SubStack: I can't write it... there's no lambdas on it

[03:24] jesusabdullah: aaroninfidel: I was having github push json towards a connect server, which should preeeeeetty much be like how you'd do it in express
[03:24] materialdesigner: Why can't you just createan http client for the API emailing?

[04:41] binarypie has joined the channel
[04:41] igl: d0k felt offended i think
[04:41] jesusabdullah: The point with c vs. assembly is just that c is an abstraction, right?
[04:41] d0k: igl: nope
[04:41] jesusabdullah: You could make the same argument, presumably, or a similar one
[04:41] d0k: I don't write coffescript
[04:41] jesusabdullah: It's an analogy
[04:42] jesusabdullah: CS is actually pretty cool, I think, aside from that
[04:42] d0k: to be honest, I haven't even used js in a while ;)
[04:42] igl: abstraction is wonderful if it makes things simpler
[04:42] igl: but CS adds more logic than needed
[04:42] jesusabdullah: Well
[04:42] jesusabdullah: CS makes *some* things simpler

[04:43] jesusabdullah: except django is python, and coffeescript is still javascript in all the important ways

[04:53] jesusabdullah: rails?
[04:53] igl: hypothetical yeah
[04:54] jesusabdullah: Yeah, I admit that this turns me off a little bit from coffeescript projects
[04:54] jesusabdullah: but luckily, there isn't that much to learn
[04:54] jesusabdullah: It *looks* different but it's pretty much the same aside from different symbols
[04:54] jesusabdullah: Ask someone that knows whether I'm talking about semantics or syntax or what
[04:54] jesusabdullah: probably semantics
[04:54] jesusabdullah: "It's just semantics" right?
[04:55] jesusabdullah: That said, that's *still* a barrier, so for library development javascript is more attractive
[04:56] igl: yea i think it is healthy to remove barriers
[04:56] igl: haml like templating i get fully support, it removes the complexity
[04:56] jesusabdullah: For app dev, though, why not? If cs is what you like, it's what you like

[05:01] mnaser: it's not IR_black
[05:03] chjj: deoxxa: yeah, the original markdown is a mess of regexes as far as i know, the lexer i wrote uses regexes for lexemes, but it actually tokenizes instead of making love to a string of text
[05:03] kasper: mnaser: 2morrow Night is also great, you can see it here: http://wiki.macromates.com/Themes/UserSubmittedThemes
[05:03] deoxxa: yeah, that's the way to do it
[05:03] mnaser: yeah i was just on the page and it looks like thats it
[05:03] deoxxa: i write a lot of parsers etc for work, which often involves my boss going "look at this product and see if you can reuse any of the code"
[05:04] deoxxa: which involves me going "oh my, no, no no no. that is horrid."
[05:04] chjj: lol
[05:04] deoxxa: so i feel where you're coming from with the "this is rough" comment :P
[05:05] deoxxa: my favourites are the parsers that pretend to have a grammar, but don't
[05:05] deoxxa: case in point: silverstripe's template parser
[05:05] chjj: well, im writing a little markdown test suite, and then testing my parser vs other ones, like markdown.js, and showdown, but they both do things completely differently, and a lot of things they just do *wrong*
[05:05] deoxxa: ah, yeah
[05:06] chjj: ive never heard of that
[05:06] chjj: whats a silverstripe?

[05:06] chjj: oh
[05:06] chjj: hehe
[05:06] dgathright has joined the channel
[05:07] deoxxa: basically their templates are so close to being properly parseable
[05:07] deoxxa: <strong><% if Method_On_Controller %>Yes!<% else %>No!<% end_if %></strong>
[05:08] deoxxa: they have that kind of construct implemented as a single regex
[05:08] deoxxa: makes me want to cry
[05:08] chjj: why is <% such a popular convention in templating languages, its so damn awkward to type
[05:08] mikeal has joined the channel
[05:08] deoxxa: then they have <% if Method_On_Controller(argument_1) %>
[05:08] chjj: a single regex? is it a recursive regex?

[05:08] mikeal1 has joined the channel

[07:07] isaacs: alexhq: so, if you have a socket open for a really long time, let's say, and youer' sending movies over it, or some other big thing.
[07:08] isaacs: alexhq: at some point, the "socket.bytesRead" might be big enough that you lose count of them.  that is, the number flips into float-mode, and then eventually, exceeds its mantissa length.
[07:08] isaacs: the first loss of precision starts at 2^32.  the next at 2^51.
[07:08] isaacs: but that's a LOT of bytes.
[07:09] isaacs: at that point, being one or two off has gotta be ok.

[07:16] DrPizza: I doubt you can even hit 2^53 anyway

[07:24] dexter_e: Anyone know if its possible to do  default assignment in ejs    ( myfieldname || "None")
[07:25] dexter_e: the same way you would do in javascript     var a = something || "default stuff" 
[07:25] dexter_e: or      var a = s && "default-string"  
[07:26] DrPizza: shouldn't do that.
[07:26] smolyn has joined the channel
[07:27] DrPizza: what if "something" is a false or false-like value?
[07:27] DrPizza: you'll then set 'a' to the default value
[07:27] DrPizza: even though the user specified it!
[07:28] amerine has joined the channel
[07:29] dexter_e: well that was just an example 
[07:29] dexter_e: we can go with     var a = s || "default";
[07:30] ezmobius has joined the channel
[07:30] DrPizza: so if the user specifies '' (empty string) you'll ignore them!
[07:30] DrPizza: same problem
[07:30] dexter_e: that will be ok.  
[07:30] dexter_e: I just want to have semi-pleasant default results in the event of missing or unknown data.
[07:31] dexter_e: so if we run the render() method and the data going doesn't contain a field which the template requires it will still render , but with some missing data -  instead of crashing
[07:32] dexter_e: is that possible ?
[07:32] DrPizza: the most common solution I've seen that avoids the falsey problem
[07:32] DrPizza: is to have both your defaults and your arguments in an object
[07:33] dexter_e: hmm
[07:33] DrPizza: and then produce a merged object
[07:33] DrPizza: that tests argumentObject.hasOwnProperty()
[07:33] DrPizza: and only uses the default when hasOwnProperty is false
[07:33] DrPizza: so you can detect the ones which are genuinely missing
[07:34] DrPizza: rather than merely false-like
[07:35] DrPizza: dexter_e: I think jQuery and many other libraries include similar functionality built-in
[07:35] DrPizza: I think node perhaps used to but does not any more
[07:35] isaacs has joined the channel
[07:35] dexter_e: I see.   For this application I don't mind the possible sloppiness of falsy values, I just want the templates to render even if pure trash is passed into the render function
[07:36] dexter_e: Ideally the template would still render even if all the data was missing. 
[07:36] dexter_e: is that possible somehow ?
[07:37] DrPizza: dexter_e: so something like function merge(defaults, arguments) { var result = {}; for(var name in defaults) { result[name] = arguments.hasOwnProperty(name) ? arguments[name] : defaults[name]; } return result; }

[07:39] dexter_e: DrPizza: Thanks. That looks like it would do the job, but this would require that a Defaults object is manually created for every template. 
[07:39] stephank has joined the channel
[07:39] dexter_e: I would like the templates to be self-describing and self-defaulting  so that we wouldn't have to be aware of how to default them from the outside. 
[07:40] dexter_e: We can just pass pure garbage into the render and still have it render
[07:40] DrPizza: the default would be part of the template surely
[07:40] dexter_e:   oh yeah?
[07:40] dexter_e: how would that be possible?
[07:40] DrPizza: I have no idea
[07:40] dexter_e: :)
[07:40] dexter_e: oh ok
[07:41] dexter_e: Are you using ejs?
[07:41] DrPizza: If I were designing a parameterized templating engine, it would allow the setting of defaults somehow!
[07:41] DrPizza: no
[07:41] dexter_e: which one you like?
[07:42] DrPizza: I have no idea what's even on offerin the world of javasciprt
[07:43] DrPizza: and now, I sleep
[07:43] dexter_e: sweet, nighty night
[07:43] dexter_e: thanks for the input
[07:44] dexter_e: the merge solution would be awesome if you could just   merge things right into templates.

[07:50] dexter_e: hopefully they're scary
[07:51] dexter_e: I just want to do know how we can make the render method gracefully degrade instead of just crashing if one value is missing.

[09:08] tiglionabbit: I'm having a bit of trouble
[09:10] deoxxa: tiglionabbit: yes, it is easy enough, but i'm curious as to why you need it specifically
[09:10] deoxxa: it's equally simple to install from source, unless you need to deploy it to a hundred boxes or something
[09:10] tiglionabbit: deoxxa: I want to install it on ubuntu, but I don't want to use version 0.2
[09:10] tiglionabbit: but I'm sure it's better to package it than to just make install
[09:11] deoxxa: not really, as long as you install it to /usr/bin - that's where user-built applications are supposed to go
[09:11] tiglionabbit: I seem to have successfully installed a deb of the 'works' tag, but npm fails to install because 'graceful-fs' is missing
[09:12] tiglionabbit: gonna try again with 0.5.2

[09:56] mendel_: is there a easy way to get the parent directory of process.cwd()
[09:56] mendel_: of course I could split etc, but maybe there's something in the api that I'm missing
[09:58] TheJH has joined the channel
[10:00] igl: mendel_: require("path") does that for you 
[10:00] igl: path.join("/home/foo/bar", "../") =  /home/foo
[10:00] TheJH: mendel_, require('path').dirname('/etc/')
[10:00] mendel_: igi: I need to loop a directory (fs.readdir), but that dir is a subdir of the parent folder from the script it's running in
[10:01] TheJH: mendel_, just calling dirname is shorter and works, too
[10:01] boehm has joined the channel
[10:02] mendel_: so I need to loop /folder1/folder2 but my script is in /folder1/folder3
[10:02] mendel_: and I don't want to use the full path ;)

[10:03] igl: and join/concat it with the path module how i want it
[10:03] TheJH: mendel_, then path.join is better for you, I think
[10:03] mendel_: TheJH: perfect, thnx

[10:43] javajunky: oops just needed to run configure … meh hopefully these logs'll help someone else :)

[10:54] FireFly: Oh, I was using spawn, I'll try exec

[11:17] javajunky: yes, indeed, I have done (npm install -g )  .. its ok, I suspect its because the version of npm  I have isn't compatible (expects different behaviour) to the version of node.js I'm running.

[11:20] javajunky: TheJH: if I did that I might as well use git submodules (and would prefer to) .. why would I *not* do them globally ?

[11:21] Xeon06_ has joined the channel
[11:21] TheJH: javajunky, but you can try "sudo npm link foo" to make a global module locally available, should work
[11:21] TheJH: (replace foo)

[11:23] TheJH: javajunky, I'm not really sure, but I think so
[11:24] TheJH: javajunky, just try the sudo npm link thing

[15:17] broofa has joined the channel
[15:17] TheJH: booo, maybe you could look at some existing node modules? my knowledge of c is to limited to be able to help with that

[15:19] booo: TheJH, of course, i did...
[15:19] tantek has joined the channel
[15:20] pquerna: booo: what do you mean async c-library
[15:21] pquerna: booo: generally, the patterns are either its a c-library which could use libev for its event loop, and then you just use libev's functions to get callbacks for IO etc
[15:21] pquerna: booo: or its something that isn't -- so you use libeio to run the whole thing in a thread pool, and get a callback in the main thread once its 'done'
[15:23] edude03 has joined the channel
[15:25] pquerna: (there are a few that try to manage their own thread pool, you can use that too, and use libev to get a callback back in the main thread to talk to v8)

[15:42] dherman: thx -- I'm failing pretty hard just at installing
[15:43] dherman: (and then failing pretty hard at posting to the google group)
[15:43] dherman: my yaks are getting smooth
[15:43] dherman: here's the msg I tried to send to the group:
[15:43] dherman: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1279561
[15:43] dherman: tl;dr: seem to need sudo to install, and even then it's weirdly sensitive to the $PWD where I install from
[15:44] jasonh has joined the channel

[15:47] TheJH: dherman, what is wrong about the result of attempt 2?
[15:47] igl has joined the channel
[15:48] dherman: TheJH: I didn't expect it to be sensitive to where I ran the command from
[15:48] dherman: I assumed it would create the local root in my home directory
[15:48] dherman: is that not the case?
[15:48] dherman: I thought: "strange... I'd better teach myself about npm folders" but then npm help folders failed (see #4)
[15:49] jshaw has joined the channel
[15:49] dherman: I also thought it was strange that the advertised one-liner fails
[15:49] stagas has joined the channel
[15:49] dherman: why does the npm page suggest an install line that doesn't work?
[15:49] devongovett has joined the channel
[15:49] dherman: er, sorry, that sounded glib
[15:50] dherman: but something seems wrong about the fact that the advertised installation line failed. maybe something weird about my machine that npm doesn't expect?
[15:50] e6nian: what's the Circular in node.js? 
[15:50] dherman: TheJH: if it's not clear, notice the result of `npm root` at the end of attempt 2
[15:51] e6nian: Circular is a new type in node.js?
[15:51] TheJH: dherman, the npm "root" depends on the folder you're inside
[15:52] dherman: TheJH: I see. I must not be understanding its purpose then
[15:52] TheJH: dherman, when you install stuff with npm, it installs the packages in the current folder (in a subfolder "node_modules")
[15:52] dherman: TheJH: what's the rationale for it being local to the $PWD instead of the user's home directory?
[15:53] dherman: $PWD is so sensitive... it'll leave node_modules directories all over the place
[15:53] TheJH: dherman, in case you need different versions of a package in different projects or so
[15:53] dherman: I see
[15:53] TheJH: dherman, you should only run "npm install <module>" in the folder where you need that module
[15:54] dherman: oh, I think I just understood something
[15:54] dherman: `npm root` doesn't tell you anything about the installation of *npm* -- just where local packages will be installed relative to where you are now
[15:54] TheJH: dherman, that allows even crazy stuff like this: A depends on B(version 2) and C, C depends on version 1 of B
[15:55] TheJH: dherman, yes
[15:56] dherman: TheJH: huh... I don't see how local installation is either necessary or sufficient for dependency graphs like that
[15:56] dherman: couldn't global installation simply contain all versions that are needed?
[15:56] dherman: and local installation, if it only allowed one version per package, wouldn't allow such dependency graphs
[15:56] jameson has joined the channel

[16:18] dherman: ok
[16:18] dherman: I'll do that then
[16:19] xerox: you also need export NODE="$HOME/.node" and export PATH="$NODE/bin:$PATH" (and restart the shell) in your ~/.profile before installing npm
[16:19] dherman: right
[16:19] broofa has joined the channel
[16:19] dherman: presumably, you don't typically check in a project's node_modules directory to git, right?
[16:20] xerox: indeed, .gitignore has "node_modules" in it

[16:20] dherman: ah
[16:20] dherman: sweet
[16:20] dherman: ok

[22:39] augustl: some times chrome doesn't copy... here we go http://pastie.org/2261128

[22:39] augustl: sorry about that
[22:39] chjj: PASTEBIN
[22:39] augustl: chjj: aware of that
[22:39] augustl: chjj: already said I'm aware of the problem ;)
[22:39] TheJH: augustl, hmmm... seems like a bug
[22:40] augustl: yeah.. I'd say it makes sense to check what's already installed before checking the registry
[22:40] augustl: I'll wait in the shadows and stab isaacs when he's around

[22:45] isaacs: ACTION stabs augustl 
[22:45] isaacs: HAHA!!
[22:45] augustl: oh noes
[22:46] augustl: but I was tabbed out :(
[22:47] augustl: isaacs: so, should npm link check for already installed/linked dependencies before checking the npm registry?
[22:47] robinouu: chjj: sounds good, thanks. Do you know why it doesn't work on 0.5.x ?
[22:48] isaacs: augustl: i gotta run.  post an issue if it's doing what you don't like
[22:49] augustl: isaacs: kk, tnx

[23:02] systemfault: Not sure I get your "empty items"
[23:02] egeste: Hello @ all. I'm a completely new user to node.js, it was recommended to me as a solution for using long polling as an event listener to a third party service. I notices that node.js spceifically advertises that it's for V8 javascript - I apologize if this question is ignorant, but, in terms of compatibility, deoes node.js function correctly across ff, ie, chrome, safari, etc? Is there a browser compatibility chart/matrix somewhere I can refere
[23:03] geetarista has left the channel
[23:03] blkcat: clockwize: you mean whitespace?
[23:03] AvianFlu: egeste: server-side javascript
[23:03] jhurliman: egeste, node.js was designed to run in a server environment. it does not run in a browser
[23:03] AvianFlu: no browsers
[23:03] TheJH: augustl, I just tried "npm link" in an unpublished package, works
[23:03] egeste: thats what it looked like
[23:04] TheJH: augustl, what does "npm -v" say? I have "1.0.10"
[23:04] jhurliman: egeste, for your situation, it sounds like the recommendation was to use node.js as an intermediary between the clients (browsers) and the third party service
[23:05] TheJH: augustl, mhm, you have a newer version
[23:05] clockwize: systemfault/blkcat: i mean if you split("/2/1/3/") you get ["", "2", "1", "3", ""]
[23:05] deoxxa: egeste: you might be interested in socket.io
[23:06] systemfault: clockwize: You could use filter on it

[23:08] TheJH: systemfault, there are even 2 bots, but jhbot does other stuff
[23:08] systemfault: Ah ok, thanks :)
[23:08] clockwize: for my next problem, i've just npm installed connect, but when i do connect = require 'connect', it can't find it?
[23:08] TheJH: !@systemfault npm search foo

[23:08] tuhoojabotti: TheJH: It does queryspam? :O
[23:08] tuhoojabotti: cool
[23:09] tuhoojabotti: I can do that too.
[23:09] tuhoojabotti: oh no
[23:09] tuhoojabotti: not query
[23:09] TheJH: tuhoojabotti, queryspam? huh?

[23:44] mnaser: Any suggestions on perhaps a library that executes commands (basically like system(..))
[23:44] xerox: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.10/api/child_processes.html
[23:45] mnaser: thats what I'm using but it really seems to be a pain when doing a bunch of them.. the cod looks scary
[23:45] xerox: is it?
[23:46] mscdex: nail_: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/ECMA-5-Mozilla-Features-Implemented-in-V8
[23:46] mnaser: It's what I've been using..

[23:46] xerox: but what do I know
[23:46] Nuck: hmmm
[23:46] nail_: thx mscdex 
[23:47] mscdex: child_processes rock!
[23:47] Nuck: In mongo, I want to have my artworks numbered incrementally...
[23:47] mnaser: mscdex: have you had to chain up a bunch that depend on the success of the former ones?
[23:47] mnaser: it does get quite messy
[23:47] Nuck: But I'm not sure if I should override _id
[23:49] mnaser: and this might sound really stupid, but should everything really be a callback, it's almost impossible to chain a call and i seem to find myself in deep hardcore chaining.
[23:49] AvianFlu: mnaser: make them all work off of events
[23:49] Me1000 has joined the channel
[23:49] AvianFlu: mnaser: name your callbacks
[23:49] mscdex: mnaser: if you have a linear set of commands to execute, store them in an array and reuse a function that does the actually child process execution, one at a time
[23:49] Nuck: mnaserL You get used to it
[23:49] mscdex: there's multiple ways to go about it
[23:50] mnaser: work off events, any info on that?  also naming my callbacks, I'm getting around doing that
[23:50] Nuck: I don't see anything wrong with callbacks.  I did at one time, but I don'y any more.
[23:50] mnaser: that makes sense, mscdex.. sounds clean too
[23:50] AvianFlu: mnaser: the child processes have events that they emit when things happen
[23:51] mnaser: ah, the .on and so on, i see
[23:51] Nuck: If those Events don't work for you, you can always use your own EventEmitters.
[23:51] AvianFlu: do child.on('exit', function (code) {console.log('process exited with status code %d.', code) });
