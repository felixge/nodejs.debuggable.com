[08:26] devaholic: megalomix: right
[08:26] devaholic: icebox/augustl are saying that if index.pages had return function () {} that you could call index.pages()
[08:27] devaholic: express expects a function

[08:30] rmzg: Are you restarting node when you make changes?
[08:30] megalomix: yes it prints

[09:28] blax: hello there gentlemen, what are the best practices to share some global object (eg. logger) between all modules in node app?
[09:29] mcepl: DrMcKay: you mean spellchecking? ... yes, that's a bit silly
[09:29] blax: I don't want to reinstantiate it every time, global variables are ugly, creating it once and then passing it to every single constructor doesn't look good for me too.. 
[09:30] augustl: hotroot: imo it's silly to build plain websites with node
[09:30] augustl: which is what the book example does
[09:30] hotroot: His does file uploading 
[09:31] augustl: hmm, that's useful actually
[09:31] hotroot: I just need the basics though. Other sources may have _more_ information, but that's not what I want. I want clear and formatted information.
[09:31] Glenjamin: blax: passing it is the proper way
[09:31] Glenjamin: you can develop a convention throughout your codebase of passing standard object around which always has a "logger" property, for example
[09:32] Glenjamin: and then you don't have to go re-write loads of signatures when you need to pass something else around
[09:32] blax: Glenjamin: thanks, is that much better than "global" object though?
[09:32] Glenjamin: yes
[09:32] Glenjamin: because you can have more than one
[09:33] Glenjamin: no magic shared state means testing is easiere
[09:33] blax: well, okay then
[09:33] hotroot: Well, this is interesting. Just installed node and now I can't run node from the command line...

[09:35] hotroot: It ran fine right after I installed it
[09:35] Glenjamin: blax: you could call it "global" :p
[09:36] Glenjamin: "options" is usually good enough

[10:50] blueadept: is 602 septillion a sufficiently large enough number to use for randomized id tags?
[10:50] blueadept: i'm thinking so
[10:50] i9: very probably so
[10:52] lmatteis: what's the best library to interface with simpledb?
[10:53] blueadept: i9: what's the issue with mongo? can't retrieve data?
[10:53] blueadept: what's the error say?
[10:53] i9: i can't find a good tutorial / example on the subject
[10:53] courpse: How do i send json data back to client?
[10:53] courpse: I tried sending application/json as content-type.
[10:53] blueadept: i'd recommend with possibly going with an ORM instead of the native driver, i9
[10:53] blueadept: i9: have you looked at mongoose?
[10:54] blueadept: or possibly something like mongolian, which is closer to the command line
[10:54] i9: blueadept: yes, but I have had some serious problems getting it installed on windows (which is a necessity unfortunately)
[10:54] i9: since i can't run npm on windows
[10:55] i9: so i went native
[10:55] blueadept: courpse: what are you using for http?
[10:55] ecin_ has joined the channel
[10:55] blueadept: express?
[10:55] blueadept: i9: i see
[10:55] blueadept: hm
[10:55] courpse: Pass? i;m newb.
[10:55] courpse: 'http'
[10:55] blueadept: well you have to set the contentType
[10:55] i9: any good suggestions? i'm kind of desperate at this point
[10:56] courpse: oh, Not Content-Type?
[10:56] blueadept: er i mean Content-Type
[10:56] blueadept: yeah
[10:56] courpse: Well, im setting it to application/json.
[10:56] blueadept: i9: can you boot up a linux vm?
[10:56] courpse: Resource interpreted as Script but transferred with MIME type application/json.
[10:57] blueadept: i9: it's only $10 a month at places like rackspace or amazon
[10:57] courpse: 	res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'application/json'});	res.write('"Hello, World!"');	res.end();
[10:57] courpse: Thats literally all im sending.
[10:57] blueadept: courpse: and what do you see in the browser?
[10:57] courpse: Nothing.
[10:57] i9: blueadept: like i said, OS isn't optional unfortunately
[10:57] courpse: but in dev tools, i see that resource interpreted error.
[10:57] i9: it needs to run on windows

[11:02] lmatteis: is there a good cloud text-search optimized database?
[11:02] blueadept: i use express to abstract some of that stuff for me
[11:02] blueadept: and it works for me as well
[11:02] lmatteis: something like simpledb but optimized for searching,
[11:02] blueadept: but i am JSON.stringify 'ing the response as well
[11:03] courpse: Well, i can't even get a response, :/

[11:06] courpse: Um almost, heh.
[11:07] courpse: Very little has changed.
[11:07] courpse: I'm about to try that express you speak of.
[11:07] blueadept: works for me
[11:08] blueadept: i just tried it
[11:09] blueadept: i mean i don't see anything in the browser
[11:09] blueadept: because the browser is trying to download the json document
[11:09] blueadept: yeah se
[11:09] r04r has joined the channel
[11:09] blueadept: i see what's going on here
[11:09] blueadept: that's not the right way to serve up json if you really want to do it that way
[11:10] courpse: Humm, json is just plain text aint it?
[11:10] Swizec has joined the channel
[11:10] courpse: And that was correctly formated json.
[11:11] courpse: FF handles JSON headers incorrectly, or more so, it trys to download it, instead of display as text.
[11:11] blueadept: you have to stringily the object
[11:12] blueadept: so for instance, don't do res.write
[11:12] blueadept: do res.end(JSON.stringify({ msg: 'Hello world'}))
[11:12] lmatteis: is there a good cloud text-search optimized database?
[11:13] courpse: :/
[11:13] courpse: Really?
[11:13] courpse: Aight.
[11:13] blueadept: or use express like i said
[11:13] blueadept: i'm writing a whole API right now with json responses
[11:14] blueadept: express works like a charm 
[11:14] blueadept: you can take a look at the source to figure out how it's handling the requests
[11:14] blueadept: https://github.com/visionmedia/express/blob/master/lib/response.js
[11:15] murilobr has joined the channel

[11:32] courpse: There is no file.
[11:32] blueadept: devaholic: nah that shouldn't matter
[11:32] blueadept: like i said, works for me
[11:32] courpse: Its just sending the json over with json headers attached.
[11:33] blueadept: are you trying to do some ajax magic, is that mostly why you're going with json?
[11:33] devaholic: or you could use a relative path in your ajax call
[11:33] courpse: Heh, for a starters, i'd like to do anything with this, first time nodejs, and its not workign out too well.

[11:45] devaholic: well, you probably need to changed to json or no datatype so it's  more forgiving
[11:45] devaholic: if not, then change your response to { "msg": "Hello world" } with double quotes
[11:45] courpse: A direct call to the server works, its only in the success: of the $.ajax that breaks it.
[11:46] devaholic: perhaps firefox implements the jsonp more strictly/differently than chrome
[11:46] hellp has joined the channel
[11:46] devaholic: cant really say i know anything about that, since jsonp is generally discouraged
[11:47] courpse: k, with using dataType json, and appending callback=? to my url, it does the same thing.
[11:48] devaholic: also, you realize you are json.stringify'ing something that is already, more or less, stringified json
[11:48] brianseeders has joined the channel
[11:49] devaholic: what is the actual url? is it up on the web?

[13:42] bnoordhuis: khismetix: then you probably won't see big improvements
[13:42] khismetix: from the literature it seems like node.js helps by being leaner on resources for long lived connections compared to trad http servers
[13:42] bnoordhuis: khismetix: yes, and it helps with slow clients too

[13:46] khismetix: Would node.js, for example, help if say a mobile client got temporarily disconnected
[13:46] MrNibbles: I'm creating a header for some js files, so that when parsed by phantomJS, it can find the path to the tests. Just wondering if there was a common format i should use for this header
[13:46] khismetix: I'm guessing a trad http server would have to timeout the idle connection
[13:46] MrNibbles: or perhaps someone could point me in the right direction for this
[13:46] bnoordhuis: khismetix: node has the same issue, it's inherent to tcp
[13:46] khismetix: oh ,.. yes you are 100% correct
[13:46] bnoordhuis: khismetix: the only way to detect it is to send ping messages at regular intervals

[13:48] DrMcKay: ksheurs: just a hint: for synchronizing things with mobile, you guys may use CouchDB and couchmobile
[13:48] DrMcKay: khismetix: ^
[13:48] MrNibbles: i know Michelil vaguely, never caught him on here before thogh
[13:48] DrMcKay: sorry ksheurs, tab-complete fail
[13:48] mikeal: he's micheil
[13:48] khismetix: must look into couchDB/couchmobile
[13:48] MrNibbles: mikeal: ha, sorry bad typo
[13:48] khismetix: are they like no-SQL dbs like red is ?
[13:49] khismetix: redis , I mean
[13:49] MrNibbles: mikeal: ta
[13:49] DrMcKay: khismetix: yes, but they're very fault-tolerant
[13:49] mikeal: CouchDB's data model is designed for offline data access and sync via replication later

[13:50] khismetix: DrMcKay.. so in the case where a mobile client loses a connection ....
[13:50] DrMcKay: khismetix: he gets resynchronized later
[13:50] khismetix: it can recover lost data if using something like couchmobile
[13:50] DrMcKay: khismetix: yes
[13:50] mikeal: yup, you can continue to write and read to the local db
[13:50] DrMcKay: also, if he made any changes to his database, they get merged, if you want to
[13:50] mikeal: and then later when it's back online, you sync
[13:51] khismetix: right.. I think we had used something like a protocol whereby upon explicit reconnection the server gives you the most recently issued response
[13:51] khismetix: which is robust as far as losing a maximum of 1 message
[13:51] khismetix: it assumes that, if the frequency of message updates is lower than the time taken to reconnect then you *mostly* can stay in sync
[13:52] mehtryx has joined the channel
[13:52] khismetix: sounds like couch mobile would make the chance of data loss virtually zero

[13:57] khismetix: DrMcK.. couchedb mobile looks very interesting
[13:57] khismetix: So, what are the alternatives to node.js for doing long lived connections ?
[13:58] khismetix: I assume one is to use tomcat and some extension .. but sounds resource intensive
[13:58] bnoordhuis: khismetix: netty, yes
[13:58] bnoordhuis: it's also somewhat painful to work with

[14:00] DrMcKay: khismetix: setting it up is really easy
[14:00] khismetix: DrMcKay .. does it support long poll ?
[14:00] khismetix: or is it pure request/response ?
[14:00] bnoordhuis: it's rest-based i think?
[14:02] khismetix: rest would seem to imply traditional request/wait/response ?

[14:13] khismetix: Ok.. couch looks super useful
[14:13] khismetix: I'm guessing it is orthogonal to node.js … 
[14:13] khismetix: i.e .. I mean the two don't really have any interdependence
[14:14] DrMcKay: khismetix: not really, but you may found node.js useful
[14:14] DrMcKay: for example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2-gHIMSnUo
[14:14] misterncw has joined the channel
[14:14] DrMcKay: you can listen for events from this couchdb _changes feed
[14:14] khismetix: It does say this (in relation to couch db) Another general consequence of this technique is that for each client requesting a long polling change notification, CouchDB will have to keep an HTTP connection open. CouchDB is well capable of doing so, as it is designed to handle many concurrent requests. But you need to make sure your operating system allows CouchDB to use at least as many sockets as you have long polling
[14:14] khismetix:  clients (and a few spare for regular requests, of course).
[14:15] fread2281 has joined the channel
[14:15] DrMcKay: khismetix: it's about ulimit -n, I believe
[14:15] khismetix: this would suggest that couch db suffers from the scalability issue that , I think, node.js addresses
[14:15] DrMcKay: khismetix: no no
[14:15] khismetix: ok. .go ahead
[14:15] DrMcKay: khismetix: it's about limit of open files
[14:15] DrMcKay: khismetix: by default (?) Linux can have 1024 open files/process
[14:16] khismetix: sure. .I know that
[14:16] khismetix: Is node.js not immune to that
[14:16] DrMcKay: khismetix: and each long poll is an open file (socket is a file as well)
[14:16] testeroo has joined the channel
[14:16] DrMcKay: khismetix: no, but you can easily change this limit
[14:16] brianc has joined the channel
[14:17] khismetix: just to be sure.. are you saying node.js *is* immune to the u limit issue ?
[14:17] normanrichards has joined the channel
[14:17] khismetix: I agree it is easy to up the u limit
[14:17] blissdev has joined the channel
[14:17] DrMcKay: khismetix: node.js can handle even concurrent 10 k request, but OS has to let him do that
[14:17] DrMcKay: khismetix: so it's all about setting ulimit -n to a higher value :)
[14:18] khismetix: Am I correct in saying that node.js only needs to call on that limit if the events it is acting on are concurrent
[14:18] khismetix: i.e if it has to service 10k requests all at once
[14:19] khismetix: whereas with long polling you need to maintain 10k persistent connections whether or not the response is due to be sent to the clients ?
[14:19] DrMcKay: khismetix: not really. node *can* hit that limit if you're handling something that opens a file, e.g. accepting a HTTP request
[14:19] aheckmann has joined the channel
[14:19] DrMcKay: khismetix: 10k persistent connections == 10k open sockets
[14:19] khismetix: ok
[14:20] DrMcKay: khismetix: so, it's pretty much all about how you set your ulimit -n :)
[14:20] DrMcKay: and using cluster may help, since it fires up many processes
[14:20] khismetix: Sure.. I do like the sound of couch db.. looks very useful for mobile apps in general

[15:32] mikeal has joined the channel

[17:48] elliottcable: basically, here’s what I’m doing:
[17:48] TheJH: elliottcable, the only globals you have in the new context are the Object prototype methods and the stuff you exposed
[17:48] elliottcable: I’m creating a context for new files to run in, a sandbox object,
[17:48] elliottcable: I pass the sandbox object in, and modify it to add new globals
[17:48] elliottcable: something along those lines.
[17:48] TheJH: elliottcable, "sandbox"? you're not using it for security, right?
[17:48] elliottcable: nope
[17:48] elliottcable: it’s a `require()` replacement, so it’s doing a lot of similar stuff
[17:49] TheJH: ah, ok

[17:49] jsurfer has joined the channel
[17:49] elliottcable: however, some very basic stuff … isn’t working, and in an inexplicable way
[17:49] TheJH: elliottcable, could you paste a simple demo gist somewhere?
[17:49] elliottcable: for instance, inside, `global === the_sandbox.global` is false
[17:49] elliottcable: which is extremely odd. How could the global variable “global” exist, if it’s not defined on the sandbox?
[17:50] SubStack: pretty sure runInNewContext doesn't give a shit about globals
[17:50] context: please dont run anything inside of me
[17:50] SubStack: context is just for top-level lexicals
[17:50] elliottcable: I thought maybe the `vm` module was creating it, but nope; as you just discovered when running that snippet, there shouldn’t be any “global” object

[17:53] TheJH: elliottcable, hard to help when I've got no code to look at
[17:53] elliottcable: TheJH › the new context has no code except for “throw global === <context>.global”
[17:53] context: you PUT whatever you want in the context.
[17:53] elliottcable: which prints false (have to use throw, since console isn’t available)
[17:53] context: simple as that.
[17:53] elliottcable: context › read that again
[17:53] elliottcable: “global !== <context>.global”
[17:53] elliottcable: so it’s *not* coming in from the context object
[17:53] context: :/
[17:53] elliottcable: that’s … why I’m so damn confused

[18:08] TheJH: elliottcable, inside the VM, the root global object is always a different one than in the upper context, I think - for example, has another constructor
[18:08] elliottcable: also, of interest: you can see I was iterating properties with Object.getOwnPropertyNames for the odd `global` object
[18:08] elliottcable: it has *no properties*, nothing whatsoever. A completely empty object.

[20:39] bradleymeck: c4milo1, require early and once you have done the require wait for an event (commonly this is done by making module.exports a function)
[20:40] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[20:40] bradleymeck: if you have a circular dep though, you may want to restructure your code since they are often the result of forcing something into an abstraction / multiple modules
[20:40] c4milo1: bradleymeck: do you have any example of what you are saying? 
[20:41] c4milo1: bradleymeck: got it

[21:07] RK: and the real windows node can be run through the downloader which is on net?

[21:34] joshkehn: Did you require() it?
[21:34] shellox: if i try it in the interactive shell, then the command works
[21:34] brainproxy: shellox: in the REPL you may need to require underscore as something other than _

[21:40] eirikb: Hello. I'm going to store some json, what is the best appraoch? Folders and .json-files, or are there some neat db-ish solutions that would be easier/faster?
[21:40] Lingerance: MongoDB can store JSON.
[21:41] joshkehn: eirikb: MongoDB runs off of BSON 
[21:41] joshkehn: Which is pretty close to JSON
[21:41] CoverSlide: as can couch
[21:41] joshkehn: I think Couch uses JSON as well
[21:41] eirikb: Lingerance: Do I need to install MongoDB or will it work as a plain file in my project?
[21:41] joshkehn: Depends on your uses. 
[21:41] joshkehn: eirikb: You would need to install it.
[21:41] Lingerance: You need to install it
[21:41] joshkehn: Didn't someone write a JSON in-mem database that could write out to a file?
[21:41] eirikb: joshkehn: I'm not the keen on installing something, it's not anything fancy, just need to throw out json to the browser
[21:41] CoverSlide: there are in-process db stores for node

[21:49] euforic: jmoyers but if it was a bank account i wouldn't need the CC in the ref names and CREDITCARD would be BANK
[21:49] jmoyers: you are looking for a way to dynamically access the object?
[21:49] tjholowaychuk: shellox <%= n %>
[21:49] shellox: tjholowaychuk: right
