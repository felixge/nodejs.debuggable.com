[00:00] towski has joined the channel
[00:00] ako: just tried it... works fine
[00:00] abjorn: same here
[00:00] ako: document.getElementById('header').style.marginLeft="10px" <- on reddit does indeed move the header 10px to the right
[00:00] abjorn: document.getElementById("main").style.marginLeft = "10px";

[00:01] JSprob: hmm
[00:01] ako: and i agree. wrong channel. :P
[00:01] JSprob: yes i know sorry
[00:01] JSprob: but there is no traffic atm
[00:01] abjorn: make sure the `format` var is really what you think it is
[00:02] JSprob: it is a string
[00:02] StanlySoManly has joined the channel
[00:02] JSprob: "10px"
[00:02] JSprob: so i thought it should work
[00:02] ako: try it in firebug
[00:02] ako: (or whatever)
[00:03] JSprob: i did :D
[00:04] JSprob: well now i changed it to document.getElementById('stephie').style.marginLeft = "\"" + erg2 + "px\"";
[00:04] JSprob: erg2 is the number 10
[00:04] abjorn: o.O
[00:04] JSprob: but doesnt work either
[00:04] jmoyers: no need for almost any of that
[00:04] JSprob: okay looks like i did it wrong :D
[00:04] jmoyers: value + "px";
[00:04] jmoyers: should work fine
[00:04] abjorn: almost any of that? try "all" of that
[00:04] jmoyers: its not looking for " in the string
[00:04] abjorn: :p
[00:04] abjorn: yeah a string saying "10px" should be just fine
[00:04] ako: that's '"10px"'
[00:05] JSprob: but the number is a variable
[00:05] ako: not '10px' (or "10px")
[00:05] JSprob: its calculated
[00:05] abjorn: the DOM may be crap but it's not *that* bad
[00:05] jmoyers: i'd recommend making sure whatever element you are adding a margin to also works with vanilla css
[00:05] ako: number + string = string
[00:05] abjorn: what jmoyers said
[00:05] JSprob: okay i try it
[00:05] JSprob: thank you
[00:05] JSprob: =)
[00:05] jmoyers: style="margin-left: 10px" or whatnot
[00:05] JSprob: yes

[00:43] JakeyChan: look
[00:43] JakeyChan: function Server () {
[00:43] JakeyChan: 	
[00:43] JakeyChan: }
[00:43] JakeyChan: Server.prototype.init = function () {

[00:43] postwait has joined the channel
[00:43] bnoordhuis: JakeyChan: module.exports lets you export an object in one go
[00:44] bnoordhuis: JakeyChan: e.g. module.exports = new MyCustomObject();
[00:44] MrNko has joined the channel
[00:44] JakeyChan: how about module.exports = MyCustomObject ? I did not instance it 
[00:45] JakeyChan: can it work ?
[00:45] bnoordhuis: JakeyChan: that works too
[00:45] JakeyChan: then how about this one : exports = MyCustomObject ??
[00:45] jyap: 'sudo npm -g install dateformat' installs to '/usr/lib/node_modules/dateformat' but i find i always need to install modules as local use or they can't be found.  eg. Error: Cannot find module 'dateformat'  --> i'm missing something on install?
[00:45] JakeyChan: can it work ? 
[00:47] junkee[]: JakeyChan: i dont think so but just try it
[00:48] JakeyChan: junkee[]: I tried, and it can not work :( I do not know why 
[00:49] bnoordhuis: JakeyChan: because exports is a reference to an object and you're reassigning it
[00:50] jyap: and even then, i'm installing modules to the local path: ./node_modules/dateformat
[00:50] agnat has joined the channel
[00:50] MrNko has joined the channel
[00:50] jmoyers: -g is for binaries
[00:50] jmoyers: jyap install locally
[00:50] jyap: is node meant to read a global module path?
[00:51] tmpvar: jyap, not any more
[00:51] JakeyChan: bnoordhuis: do not understand that :(
[00:51] aho: <***> for me, the problem with node docs is too much information is in prose
[00:51] aho: <***> and I'm not good enough to write an English-parsing script ;)
[00:51] aho: fwiw, i fully agree with that
[00:51] jmoyers: jyap i believe you can also use npm link {package} if its installed globally
[00:51] jyap: hmm, that's strange.  for security concerns?
[00:52] jmoyers: but, you still have to run the npm link locally
[00:52] jyap: i'm coming from python so i'm accustomed to install module once, available everywhere
[00:52] zivester has joined the channel
[00:52] jmoyers: yeah, not how npm works anymore
[00:52] bnoordhuis: JakeyChan: exports points to an object x that node manages. when you do `exports = foo`, you're making exports point to another object - but node still uses object x
[00:53] [[zz]] has joined the channel

[01:02] CStumph has joined the channel
[01:02] devongovett has joined the channel
[01:02] aho: for one, it makes them easier to read if you don't have to skim through random prose. secondly, if they are machine readable you can generate context sensitive help stuff for IDEs
[01:03] incredimike: got an HTTP question for anyone in-the-know.. an API is responding with "HTTP/1.1 100 Continue\n\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request" then the rest of the headers. Is it appropriate to have a status code, then another status code like that?
[01:04] TooTallNate has joined the channel
[01:04] seebees: aho: I agree, it would be cool if the docs were parseable
[01:05] aho: ideally, they'd also exist in a deserializable format (e.g. json)
[01:05] Nuck: They're markdown
[01:05] seebees: yes, I know
[01:05] Nuck: Just a bunch of markdown
[01:05] aho: yes
[01:05] incredimike: yeah, I guess it is according to google
[01:05] aho: so which of those things are functions
[01:05] aho: which are fields
[01:06] seebees: and you can kind of parse the markdown
[01:06] aho: what is returned
[01:06] aho: what are the parameters and what are they good for?
[01:06] aho: y'know... stuff like that
[01:06] junkee[]: i think you wish something like g object introspection, just a bit easier
[01:06] Nuck: I'd take the higher quality hand-written docs for humans than some silly parsable format, honestly.
[01:06] brianseeders has joined the channel
[01:07] Nuck: I prefer verbosity for the sake of clarity
[01:08] seebees: hum, that is true, but it should be possible to have something that is verbose and parseable?

[01:08] aho: yes
[01:08] Nuck: Yeah, using HTML tags
[01:08] aho: see java's docs
[01:08] Nuck: But that means nilot using markdown
[01:08] aho: no matter how much you might hate it, its docs are top notch
[01:09] Nuck: Which I think would make our docs be lower quality
[01:09] Nuck: I think node's docs are some of the best
[01:09] c4milo1 has joined the channel
[01:09] seebees: why?  I would use markdown.  Just a few standards and you could parse them.
[01:10] seebees: right now the module name is the html file name
[01:10] seebees: and all the methods have a ### desc.
[01:10] aho: aaand... that's about it :)
[01:10] aho: well, you can infer some details
[01:10] seebees: All you need is something like a table that describes calling/return stuff
[01:11] seebees: I don't think it should be either/or.  It should be and :)
[01:11] aho: "new ..." = constructor. "[a-z]+\.blabla(...)" = instance method. "[a-z]+\.blabla" = field etc
[01:11] aho: ye

[04:04] tiagobutzke_ has joined the channel
[04:05] bogdanbiv: My npm install works just fine when I tell it npm install -g forever, but crashes when I tell it to "explore": npm explore npm
[04:06] bogdanbiv: Now I don't understand explore enough to care about it, but I've read it's a way to check my install.

[04:12] bogdanbiv: Here is my log: http://pastebin.com/aqvdXEsV
[04:13] polotek: looks like it's working fine
[04:13] bogdanbiv: Most of all, I would like to understand NPM better.
[04:13] polotek: the only thing that doesn't work is npm explore npm
[04:13] polotek: maybe it's a little too meta ;)
[04:13] bogdanbiv: I see
[04:14] polotek: bogdanbiv: ah, if you're not familiar with npm that makes a little more sense
[04:14] neilk_ has joined the channel
[04:14] polotek: are you sure you want npm explore?
[04:14] polotek: try npm ls
[04:14] polotek: that will list the currently installed modules for your local directory
[04:14] bogdanbiv: ls works great
[04:14] skm has joined the channel
[04:15] polotek: and npm ls -g will show you globally installed modules
[04:15] polotek: remember that global modules are NOT automatically available in your local directory

[04:56] kevin: it says npm-install-2458.sh: line 211:  2575 Abort trap: 6           "$node" cli.js install -gf It failed
[04:56] kenperkins has joined the channel
[04:56] kevin: and the install stopped
[04:56] kevin: and i have no npm on the system
[04:57] kevin: i ran the instructions on https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation for node
[04:57] kevin: node seems to work fine
[04:58] kevin: anyone knows what's wrong with this?
[04:58] levi501d has joined the channel
[04:59] polotek: kevin: are you using the latest node version? 0.5.6
[04:59] polotek: it's broken
[04:59] kevin: i just installed it from git
[04:59] kevin: so i guess it's the most current
[04:59] kevin: ?
[04:59] kevin: let me check the main trunk
[05:00] kevin: oh yea
[05:00] kevin: i'm using 0.5.6
[05:00] kevin: do i roll back?
[05:00] AAA_awright: We need a replacement for npm, DOWNLOADING A BUNCH OF FILES ISN'T THAT HARD PEOPLE
[05:00] kevin: ahah

[05:06] polotek: AAA_awright: nobody's forcing you to use npm
[05:06] polotek: copying files into node_modules folder works great
[05:06] kevin: alright
[05:06] kevin: i have a question
[05:07] kevin: i've used npm once in my project directory
[05:07] mikeal has joined the channel
[05:07] kevin: it seems to install the new module within my project directory
[05:07] kevin: is that the correct way
[05:07] kevin: ?
[05:07] kevin: to use npm?
[05:07] kevin: or should i install the new module in my node directory
[05:08] kevin: my program worked
[05:08] polotek: kevin: nope, local install is the correct default
[05:08] JaKWaC has joined the channel
[05:08] kevin: so i should actually call npm within my node directory you mean?
[05:08] polotek: The idea is that your project contains all of the code. No linking out to other random folders
[05:08] AAA_awright: polotek: It's darn near impossible to install an application without it
[05:08] polotek: no bothering with different version between projects
[05:08] polotek: it's nice
[05:08] polotek: AAA_awright: howzat?
[05:09] AAA_awright: No one links to the Git repositories or anything
[05:09] noodlehaus has joined the channel

[05:09] AAA_awright: package.json is not, in fact, a good way to load dependencies
[05:10] polotek: AAA_awright: I agree that there needs to be more metadata with projects
[05:10] polotek: but that's only because node is so new. most modules are pretty raw and you need the source
[05:10] neilk_ has joined the channel
[05:10] kevin: do i have to navigate to the node folder before i call my npm?
[05:10] polotek: but it's not always necessary to know where the source repo is
[05:11] polotek: and most of the time searching on github will find it

[15:03] Aikar: its perl i believe but its a long time stable project

[15:04] Aikar: you want to access data about the child iframe? that gets iffy... if your trying to read cookies and so that would be technically phishing.. if its a site you own and your trying to communicate javascript wise, you should prolly just use the browsers iframe IPC system

[15:07] Aikar: auto reload url on change?

[15:07] Aikar: is this for your own personal use?
[15:07] mape: and I'd preffer if I could reload the css without reloading the entire page
[15:07] mape: yeah
[15:07] Aikar: may wanna look at doing it with GreaseMonkey instead

[15:08] mape: just not optimal

[16:24] TheJH: ding, are you using a couchdb orm or something like that?

[16:25] DrMcKay: deep copying by stringify and parse sounds like a blasphemy to me

[16:27] ding: TheJH, that's turned off in my code, but at any rate, this is well after the query is completed and the JSON data is returned...
[16:27] stagas: :P
[16:27] ding: stagas, I'll try it
[16:28] TheJH: ding, in what way is your code not working?
[16:28] TheJH: throws an error?
[16:29] ding: stagas, TheJH, the weird thing is that when I delete ._id, both .id AND ._id get removed... No exception, no error of any kind, just not the right behavior...

[16:29] ding: This is node 0.4.10, so I'm trying to determine the version of V8 in use here...
[16:29] DrMcKay: you want to prevent deletion?
[16:29] DrMcKay: there was a method to do that
[16:30] DrMcKay: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/seal
[16:30] ding: well, couchdb docs, have an a field called "_id", but I want that renamed to just "id" (no underscore), but I end up losing both in the broken method.
[16:31] DrMcKay: no wai

[17:01] ding: stagas, it was just dummy json
[17:01] Cromulent has joined the channel

[17:02] tiagobutzke has joined the channel
[17:02] simenbrekken has joined the channel
[17:02] ZedPepsi: TheJH: because it is more succint. This JS file is not an interactive app
[17:02] ding: stagas, DrMcKay, TheJH: Thanks for your help. Was banging my head for a bit there...
[17:03] ZedPepsi: TheJH: This JS file is just a command-line tool that reads in a JSON file, checks that it parses, and spits out the SHA256 sum. it's just not the kind of app where you would normally need asynchronous reading. I can write it asynchronously but that's just overkill
[17:03] TheJH: ZedPepsi, depends on the files size :D
[17:04] ZedPepsi: TheJH: small text files
[17:04] nerdy has joined the channel
[17:04] ZedPepsi: TheJH: file size is severely limited by other parts of the project
[17:04] TheJH: ZedPepsi, also, when you use it for files, why stdin?
[17:04] TheJH: ding, huh, did you figure out the reason?
[17:05] ZedPepsi: TheJH: because I do this before I store the file on the filesystem. The file is stored in a directory and name depending on its sha256 hash, which is what this script determines
[17:05] TheJH: ZedPepsi, why do you want to do the hashing and checking in a seperate process?
[17:06] ZedPepsi: if I have to store it first it creates extra bookkeeping and possibilities for stray temp files
[17:06] Raynos: Is life good?
[17:06] ZedPepsi: TheJH: because php 4.3 does not have SHA256 or JSON parsing.
[17:06] DrMcKay: Raynos: no.
[17:06] TheJH: AAAH, PHP!
[17:06] DrMcKay: ACTION hides
[17:06] ZedPepsi: TheJH: with apologies

[17:09] Raynos: DrMcKay: /manhug
[17:09] DrMcKay: ZedPepsi: just write it in async, one level of indent doesn't hurt
[17:09] Raynos: ZedPepsi: Ignore management, port it, deploy it, deal with consequences later

[17:09] DrMcKay: Raynos: thanks :)
[17:10] DrMcKay: ZedPepsi: or wait, you need it for hashing files?
[17:10] Raynos: ZedPepsi: I think "go rogue" is a better phrase
[17:10] ZedPepsi: Raynos: Wrong context. I'm an academic with a project on my regular home page. I don't run any servers so I'm not installing anything. I am entirely uninterested in inheriting any sysadmin duties by making the sysadmin install special software which they will then not support or break periodically. Therefore, I am using the stuff they've already installed for everyone and which they must support.
[17:11] ZedPepsi: DrMcKay: precisely.
[17:11] DrMcKay: ZedPepsi: it's a unix system, it has to have openssl/sha256file installed
[17:12] Raynos: ZedPepsi: Buy domain, deploy to heroku, HTTP redirect from your academic home page to domain, HTTP redirect domain to heroku. Problem solved \o/

[17:13] vidi has joined the channel
[17:13] ZedPepsi: DrMcKay: Good catch, that appears to be available. Any suggestions for JSON validation?
[17:13] Raynos: Meh heroku just updates itself from git
[17:13] DrMcKay: ZedPepsi: JSON.parse and catch exceptions?
[17:13] Raynos: You just git push your code to heroku and heroku reboots itself. I'm no sysadmin, but heroku is easy to use
[17:14] Raynos: Small sysadmin work or PHP. The former is defiantly the lesser of evils
[17:14] ZedPepsi: DrMcKay: that is what I am doing elsewhere, but recall the context here: how would you suggest I do this from the cmdline or within my php script? php has json parsing in 5.x but not in 4.3 which is what I have to deal with
[17:14] aconbere has joined the channel
[17:15] TheJH: ZedPepsi, maybe there are libraries for it?
[17:15] ZedPepsi: TheJH: there is a JSON.php script but it seems to be too slow for me
[17:16] stagas: ding: hm cradle uses a lot of Object.defineProperty on the response object so that may be the issue, not a bug in v8
[17:16] ZedPepsi: it pegs the server in an unfortunate way
[17:16] TheJH: ZedPepsi, isn't it just an acedemic project?
[17:16] DrMcKay: also, has anyone seen Insekticid? (or is this his GH account: https://github.com/insekticid ?)
[17:16] stagas: ding: see here https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty somewhere in the middle where it mentions delete behaviour
[17:16] ZedPepsi: TheJH: yes but it needs to run properly
[17:17] ZedPepsi: I guess I'll bite the bullet and use temp files
[17:17] DrMcKay: ZedPepsi: no offence, but aren't you sick on "I-won't-touch-anything-else-than-code" syndrome
[17:17] TheJH: ZedPepsi, you could just go to #nodejitsu , ask for an account and if they give you one, deploy whatever nodejs app you want to do to <name>.nodejitsu.com

[17:19] mykul|Home has joined the channel
[17:20] ZedPepsi: TheJH: The php is just 15 lines and that will not grow. The thing that might grow is the files that are getting stored. If there are zillions it could use many gigabytes. Right now I can do that without paying anything and with proper support from our sysadmins.
[17:21] ZedPepsi: TheJH: If it really grows and the 15 lines of php do not scale, I can rewrite these 15 lines in anything and move to something else quite easily
[17:21] ZedPepsi: TheJH: in fact everything else is written in javascript, so the 15 lines of php are just to call into the javascript anyway
[17:21] TheJH: ZedPepsi, what is your project?

[17:33] Raynos: The former is awesome
[17:33] Raynos: The latter is the least hassle for a free service
[17:33] ZedPepsi: What are the nodejitsu "limits"? How much stuff can you store on their servers? If my database of little files grows to 30GB, what'll happen?

[19:28] tjgillies: jmoyers <- thnx
[19:28] jmoyers: var foo = {}; foo[]
[19:28] marcello3d: I have no idea, I stopped using windows before starting node.js
[19:28] jmoyers: var foo = {}; foo['bar' + baz] = ''
[19:29] jmoyers: rather
[19:29] marcello3d: jmoyers is right
[19:29] jmoyers: marcello3d++ linux vm is the way to go until node on windows is stable
[19:29] jmoyers: i believe there is a node.exe one can download
[19:29] jmoyers: so you don't have to compile
[19:29] bogdanbiv has joined the channel
[19:29] marcello3d: jmoyers: but that's 0.5.x, right?
[19:30] chjj: people dont give cygwin enough credit imo
[19:30] jmoyers: shrug -- are you worried about stability on local windows development :-)?
[19:30] jmoyers: cygwin is a steaming pile man
[19:30] jmoyers: no two ways to slice that
[19:30] KingCode: thx jmoyers, but don't I need NPM to use Node.js propertly? 
[19:30] marcello3d: chjj: to its credit, I think cygwin is fine for what it is
[19:30] chjj: eh, i feel comfortable with it when im on windows
[19:31] jmoyers: yes, but npm uses node
[19:31] marcello3d: chjj: I just feel like what it is isn't something I want to deal with
[19:31] chjj: marcello3d: roger
[19:31] jmoyers: i can't speak to whether npm works with node.exe though
[19:31] jmoyers: never tried it
[19:31] KingCode: ah, ok..so use node.exe, start Node and then use NPM? thx
[19:31] marcello3d: I recall that npm didn't work with the initial 0.5.x on windows. but that is changing on an hourly basis
[19:32] marcello3d: so who knows what the current status is :)
[19:32] marcello3d: is there a good way to install both node 0.4 and 0.5 on the same system and be able to switch?
[19:32] jmoyers: nvm
[19:33] jmoyers: though master of nvm is broken
[19:33] jmoyers: as i heard from the creator last night :P

[19:39] marcello3d: vows doesn't seem to be tap compatible...
[19:40] marcello3d: do you use any testing framework?
[19:40] jmoyers: TAP as i understand it
[19:40] jmoyers: is a text based protocol so that you can understand test results
[19:40] jmoyers: i use node unit myself
[19:40] Raynos: marcello3d: what's TAP ?
[19:41] jmoyers: since its the least offensive
[19:41] jmoyers: and doesn't have a compile step like expresso
[19:41] marcello3d: it's just a test result format
[19:41] Raynos: Write a vows reporter
[19:41] Raynos: to export to TAP
[19:41] marcello3d: expresso annoys me cause of the spelling :)
[19:41] Raynos: If you care about it
[19:41] nuba has joined the channel
[19:41] marcello3d: Raynos: I'm more concerned that vows is a bit verbose/awkward...
[19:41] jmoyers: not a huge fan of vows dsl
[19:42] marcello3d: yea, well it makes it hard to pass variables around
[19:42] jmoyers: i just want to run a function that will throw or not
[19:42] marcello3d: yep
[19:42] marcello3d: well in my case, I have many levels of depth
[19:42] mikeal has joined the channel
[19:42] Raynos: marcello3d: vows-is & vows-fluent
[19:43] marcello3d: and I like the idea of the unit tests actually looking like code you'd write if you were using the library
[19:43] marcello3d: so they serve as both documentation and tests
[19:43] Raynos: It is verbose. I wrote vows-is to simplify vows : https://github.com/Raynos/vows-is
[19:43] marcello3d: and easy to convert test cases into unit tests

[19:44] Raynos: I like vows because it worked
[19:44] marcello3d: :)
[19:44] Raynos: I liked the seperation of topics & vows
[19:44] marcello3d: I mean, I think vows looks great for non asynchronous stuff
[19:44] Raynos: Tbh I just didnt feel like reinventing wheels
[19:44] Raynos: I found vows to be the lesser of evils and didnt feel like rewriting something similar
[19:44] marcello3d: but one limitation I found was here https://github.com/marcello3d/node-mongolian/blob/master/test/simple-test.js#L75
[19:45] marcello3d: where basically I insert something into the database, and then retrieve it, and I want to compare the two objects, but I don't have access to the original one
[19:45] marcello3d: with regular closures that's pretty simple
[19:45] marcello3d: but with vows I need to like make an additional topic layer or something

[23:08] creationix: hey ErikCorryV8
[23:08] ErikCorryV8_: creationix: What on earth are you talking about?
[23:08] alindeman: Maybe a bug?
[23:09] aaronblohowiak: creationix: there is a lua-ev rock 
[23:09] aaronblohowiak: creationix: and there is a lua-node project
[23:09] creationix: indeed, but that's not my goal
[23:09] aaronblohowiak: =) right
[23:09] creationix: my goal isn't to write node servers in lua, it's to learn how to make something like node
[23:09] ErikCorryV8_: Ah.
[23:09] creationix: and I like node's architecture and lua seems interesting
[23:09] ErikCorryV8_: Start with the libraries that ryah has used I guess...
[23:09] creationix: I'd be sad if it took off and took away from the node community
[23:10] creationix: right, I've got libuv and http-parser already
[23:10] ErikCorryV8_: Creationix: embrace change :-)
[23:10] creationix: ErikCorryV8_: you could do a dash version if you had free time
[23:10] creationix: that would be fun too
[23:11] tbranyen: creationix: lua has some crazy stuff
[23:11] tbranyen: no sparse arrays >_>
[23:11] creationix: true coros
[23:11] ErikCorryV8_: I was going to ask how to get webgl-node working on MacOSX, but after almost punching my screen while installing something as simple as node-png I won't bother.
[23:11] creationix: any value as table keys
[23:11] tbranyen: yeah
[23:11] tbranyen: modifying the actual environment, instead of dealing with with
[23:11] creationix: ErikCorryV8_: yeah, I haven't gotten it working on osx either
[23:11] ErikCorryV8_: What do you use for node-webgl?  Windows or Linux?
[23:12] tbranyen: essentially changing the global object which is tits
[23:12] creationix: ErikCorryV8_: ubuntu
[23:12] creationix: ErikCorryV8_: and webos, so both linux
[23:13] creationix: ErikCorryV8_: if you want to try it in ubuntu, I can tell you the exact *-dev packages to install and a normal npm install using node v0.4.x will work out of the box
[23:13] ErikCorryV8_: I thought I'd add some 3d-coolness to my talk in Berlin.  It's still several weeks away so I still haven't reached the OMG-I'd-better-just-do-something-simple stage.
[23:13] ErikCorryV8_: But I'm not lugging my Ubuntu workstation to Berlin...
[23:13] ErikCorryV8_: So, perfect excuse.
[23:13] creationix: maybe a vm with gl acceleration
[23:14] creationix: I know it works under windows, not sure about under osx
[23:14] ErikCorryV8_: Yeah right.  I am a masochist so I want to mix VMs and OpenGL.
[23:14] creationix: just sayin'
[23:14] ErikCorryV8_: :-)
[23:14] creationix: you do work on a pretty crazy vm after all
[23:14] kiffness has joined the channel
[23:15] ErikCorryV8_: Yeah, not that kind.  VMWare is upstairs from us.  They keep telling us we should be using their rewind-time full system debugger to debug tricky crashes.
[23:16] creationix: ErikCorryV8_: do you know how the latest luajit compares to v8 in terms of speed?
[23:16] tiagobutzke has joined the channel
[23:16] ErikCorryV8_: Heh
[23:16] ErikCorryV8_: Mr Aleph blogged about that.
[23:16] creationix: seems like the kind of thing you would keep track of
[23:16] creationix: link?
[23:17] ErikCorryV8_: http://blog.mrale.ph/
[23:17] ErikCorryV8_: There's no doubt that LuaJIT is an awesome piece of work.
[23:18] ErikCorryV8_: And he isn't quite as constrained by the web as we are.  Like if he doesn't want to be 110% compatible then he doesn't have to be.  And if he can win some us by not doing bounds checks on typed arrays then that's OK too.

[23:21] SubStack: nifty
[23:21] creationix: piscisaureus: true, but most my projects like this die pretty shortly
[23:21] piscisaureus: creationix: heh.
[23:21] creationix: the lua community already has enough conventions that they would be adverse to a node style server
[23:21] creationix: but the vm itself seems pretty agnostic
[23:21] piscisaureus: creationix: it shouldn't be so hard though - you just have to add some libuv bindings
[23:22] creationix: right, and use http-parser to make a built-in http server
[23:22] piscisaureus: creationix: yes, well that's the idea
[23:22] creationix: but as I still  don't consider myself a C coder, this takes me a while to get started
[23:22] piscisaureus: yes, that's true
[23:22] creationix: I know what to do, but the actual concrete steps are tough
[23:23] stephank: Is there an example of good Lua code out there? I've yet to discover its beauty.
[23:23] creationix: dunno, most the docs are pretty ugly
[23:23] stephank: :B
[23:23] creationix: they don't even syntax color the snippets and it's always courier 
[23:23] stephank: But a lot of people seem to like it a lot. I'm thinking for example the Löve project.
[23:24] stephank: come to think of it, I've seen it mostly used in games
[23:24] stephank: (beautiful code in games is rare)

[23:31] creationix: ErikCorryV8_: thanks for the link.  I think I understand what I need.  Depending on the workload, luajit is fast enough for most anything I'll need it for.
[23:31] ErikCorryV8_: Probably is.
[23:32] jamescarr: looks like the best I can find so far is $79/year
[23:32] jamescarr: still, seems steep. Do all those open source projects with IO domains really shell out $79 yearly? :)

[23:37] jamescarr: in the long run, $79 isn't too much
[23:37] jamescarr: especially since it'll be for my LLC

[23:42] ErikCorryV8_: I haven't heard much.
[23:42] creationix: why llvm?
[23:42] kasmura: Yes, but i think it works in normal client-side Javascript, but not in node.js
[23:42] creationix: I just picked luajit because it's fast and runs on arm
[23:42] tbranyen: creationix: actually my project used both, i was just messing with both

[23:46] jn: is there a way to have a shared instance of a logger that i dont need to pass around everywhere? for example require('mylogger').sharedInstance
[23:46] creationix: jn that's one way
[23:46] creationix: jn: or put it in the top level closure
[23:46] creationix: if it's just within a single file
[23:47] mvrilo has joined the channel
[23:47] jn: i want to do it across multiple files
[23:47] creationix: jn, then putting it on the module instance works
[23:47] creationix: or pass it in explicitily to each module if you plan on having more than one globally
[23:48] jn: ok, nice. i'll have a go at it
[23:48] jn: thanks man
[23:48] AvianFlu: jn: you can also check out winston
[23:49] AvianFlu: http://github.com/indexzero/winston
[23:49] jn: AvianFlu: that's the logger i'm using :)
[23:49] jn: didn't realize it had a shared instance
[23:50] AvianFlu: you'd still have to share it or make it a process global or something
[23:50] AvianFlu: or tack it onto your prototype
[23:51] AvianFlu: I was suggesting it cause it's easy to work with
[23:51] AvianFlu: how "shared" are you going for
[23:51] AvianFlu: is your app all one process?
[23:51] markwubben has joined the channel
[23:55] jn: yeah, or at least until socket.io supports multiple
[23:55] jn: process global sounds interesting
[23:55] jn: how do you do that?
[23:55] tiagobutzke has joined the channel
[23:55] AvianFlu: you just have to scope it correctly, is the basic answer
[23:56] AvianFlu: there's also a `global` object
[23:57] AvianFlu: but if you've got an object prototype being used throughout, you could just MyObj.prototype.winston = new winston or whatever
[23:57] AvianFlu: i.e. just put it somewhere you can always see it, and it will work out for you
