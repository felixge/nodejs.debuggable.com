[00:07] isaacs: konobi: i'm trying to sell him on it :)
[00:07] A_Nub: so whats better couch or mongo? I cant decide
[00:07] konobi: score
[00:08] konobi: pquerna: g'wan... you know you want to
[00:09] A_Nub: mongos site says they are both good but mongo is better for speed
[00:10] perezd: +1 on mute
[00:10] blueadept: A_Nub: they're both good systems, it depends on the use case and how comfortable you are with the interface and options
[00:11] blueadept: personally i went with mongo because of the backing by 10gen
[00:11] blueadept: but that may not be the reason why you would choose either one
[00:11] A_Nub: I havent learned either yet
[00:12] blueadept: if you have a lot of xp with sql, then mongo has some similarities that make it easy to learn
[00:12] A_Nub: I tested mongo for a few minutes with a local install

[00:12] pquerna: the 415 number?
[00:13] eee_c has joined the channel
[00:13] Kami_: nope, the conference number / passcode / whatever
[00:13] perezd: couchdb fits our application model very well, thats why we chose it.

[00:18] A_Nub: blueadept: Redis sounds more like what im doing
[00:18] A_Nub: Minus the fact I have the potential for the database to get rather large.
[00:18] A_Nub: but I could just partition nightly or weekly.
[00:19] tyler-iphone: i sue redis in just about very single project
[00:19] tyler-iphone: use*
[00:19] A_Nub: why do you sue them
[00:19] A_Nub: ;)
[00:19] tjholowaychuk: ahahaha
[00:19] tjholowaychuk: I sue redis all the time too
[00:20] A_Nub: tyler-iphone: yea but how many entries do you expect?
[00:20] A_Nub: I epect alot perday
[00:20] A_Nub: with constant logging
[00:20] A_Nub: every 5 seconds
[00:20] A_Nub: from 10+ machines
[00:20] A_Nub: in hundreds tot housands of locations
[00:21] A_Nub: A DBA i talked to said mySQL
[00:21] tyler-iphone: good for you
[00:21] A_Nub: and one table
[00:21] A_Nub: which is stupid.
[00:21] A_Nub: Im not going to listen
[00:22] perezd: couchdb == awesome
[00:22] A_Nub: But people say its not good for lots of activity.
[00:22] A_Nub: is that a lie?
[00:22] perezd: A_Nub: couchdb?
[00:22] A_Nub: yes
[00:23] Kami_: yay, finally got it
[00:23] A_Nub: "Best used: For accumulating, occasionally changing data, on which pre-defined queries are to be run. Places where versioning is important."

[00:27] piscisaureus: qbert_: the port is different. that's a showstopper
[00:28] qbert_: ahh, 
[00:28] perezd: A_Nub: I dunno where all these weird opinions about couchdb came from
[00:28] perezd: its 100% non-blocking
[00:29] perezd: it has no write/read locks
[00:29] A_Nub: perezd: they are not mine im just reading.
[00:29] A_Nub: I am trying to pick the best one for my project.
[00:29] perezd: A_Nub: yeah, not directed at you, just wondering where you read that
[00:30] perezd: A_Nub: couchdb is really great if you can work with its grain
[00:30] A_Nub: here
[00:30] A_Nub: http://kkovacs.eu/cassandra-vs-mongodb-vs-couchdb-vs-redis
[00:30] perezd: A_Nub: are you sure you need docs?
[00:30] A_Nub: ?
[00:30] perezd: A_Nub: dumb question: why not use Postgres?
[00:30] perezd: or something like that
[00:31] denny has joined the channel
[00:31] A_Nub: Because its nicer to store things as object.
[00:31] A_Nub: objects*
[00:31] perezd: A_Nub: is it worth the overhead?
[00:31] A_Nub: since im doing a social network type thing
[00:31] jonpacker has joined the channel
[00:31] A_Nub: Is there that much overhead?
[00:31] perezd: document storage isn't just about ease, its about architecture design
[00:32] A_Nub: Well im not the DB expert which is why im asking ;)
[00:32] c4milo1 has joined the channel
[00:32] perezd: A_Nub: If I were you, I'd start with mysql/postgres
[00:32] A_Nub: but the DBA I talked to made a moronic suggestion to store all user sessions in 1 table.
[00:32] perezd: have you ever used map/reduce?
[00:32] A_Nub: when that list has a potential to be huge
[00:32] perezd: whats a session
[00:32] shiawuen has joined the channel
[00:33] charlenopires has joined the channel
[00:33] A_Nub: data
[00:33] A_Nub: that comes it.
[00:33] A_Nub: in*
[00:33] Guest30954: hey all. trying to proxy with request object and it appears to be hanging. 
[00:33] perezd: A_Nub: how big is that table, est.
[00:33] perezd: btw, sessions should never hit the disk, if they are transient. you should use a memcache/redis style thing for transient storage
[00:33] A_Nub: Well its for logging gym work outs, so average user 2-3 entries a week
[00:33] A_Nub: with thousands of users.
[00:33] A_Nub: quite large.
[00:34] perezd: oh
[00:34] perezd: so you don't mean like login session
[00:34] A_Nub: nope
[00:34] perezd: you mean like sessions as a unit of data
[00:34] A_Nub: workout session
[00:34] A_Nub: yes
[00:34] A_Nub: sorry
[00:34] perezd: are they normalized in schema?
[00:34] perezd: ie: you have the same dataset roughly/
[00:34] A_Nub: yes
[00:34] A_Nub: which is why I was looking towards mongo
[00:34] perezd: so, SQL is really good at storing millions of records
[00:34] perezd: and looking them up super fucking fast
[00:35] perezd: they've spent like 30 years making that fast
[00:35] A_Nub: Right but I have arrays too
[00:35] A_Nub: I mean
[00:35] Guest30954: trying request.get( {uri: 'http://realone', proxy: 'http://user:pass@proxy' }, function() { console.log(1); }) but see nothing... no timeout option either :/
[00:35] perezd: the place where docs get good is when you need joins
[00:35] A_Nub: I could do a comma separation
[00:35] perezd: across lots of disparate data sets
[00:35] perezd: OR you need something like couchdb replication
[00:35] perezd: OR you need map/reduce
[00:36] perezd: but for just "because my data should be objects", thats usually a bad reason to make that decision
[00:36] A_Nub: As I said
[00:36] perezd: not to sound like an ass, its just a really simplistic criteria for making that decision, I'd make sure you really neeed it
[00:36] A_Nub: im new to DB design
[00:36] perezd: surely, I am just providing advice
[00:36] A_Nub: Yes
[00:36] perezd: if you are new, I'd probably start with Postgres
[00:36] A_Nub: Well I have worked with mySQL
[00:36] A_Nub: before
[00:36] perezd: thats good too
[00:36] A_Nub: and its what im currently using.
[00:36] perezd: start with that, and expand over time
[00:37] A_Nub: I just hate its organization
[00:37] A_Nub: im too used too OOP
[00:37] perezd: A_Nub: ORM's really have taken care of this problem for you in a lot of ways
[00:38] A_Nub: ORM?
[00:38] perezd: Object Relational Mapper
[00:38] A_Nub: Hmm i am not sure I am aware of these
[00:38] perezd: have you written database apps before?
[00:38] Guest30954: ORM: doctrine for PHP, hibernate for Java, etc.
[00:38] A_Nub: I know that I didn't like the way SQL queries worked so i wrote my own query wrappers.
[00:38] perezd: A_Nub: this is basically what ORMs do
[00:39] perezd: they just wrap objects around data
[00:39] perezd: and provide apis
[00:39] Determinist has joined the channel
[00:39] A_Nub: Ok
[00:39] perezd: translates data to objects and back 
[00:39] A_Nub: well my api is text based which may be slower
[00:39] A_Nub: but its nice.
[00:39] eee_c has joined the channel

[01:45] pyrotechnick: then i wrote a state machine to do unions and intersections
[01:45] pyrotechnick: its badass
[01:45] pyrotechnick: then i found browserify
[01:46] pyrotechnick: and cried about how much time i wasted
[01:46] SubStack: wafer: sh1mmer is working on one I'm pretty sure
[01:46] wafer: cool
[01:47] SubStack: browserify was just a stub of a project for the longest time
[01:47] SubStack: and then I actually got it usable
[01:48] pyrotechnick: SubStack: ill show u what i use it for
[01:48] pyrotechnick: in a second
[01:48] tjholowaychuk: wtf... I'm getting oob for slice(0,68) if a buffer with .length of 128
[01:48] sh1mmer: what now?
[01:48] zentoooo has joined the channel
[01:48] pyrotechnick: tjholowaychuk: wouldnt happen in CoffeeScript

[01:49] SubStack: sh1mmer: a book
[01:49] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: is es5-shim legitsies?
[01:49] sh1mmer: oh yeah
[01:49] sh1mmer: I am doing that
[01:49] SubStack: http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920017080 why is it a rhino?
[01:49] sh1mmer: dunno
[01:49] SubStack: rhino is the other spidermonkey thing, not node!
[01:49] sh1mmer: that's weird
[01:50] sh1mmer: the book has a common tree shrew
[01:50] pyrotechnick: isaacs: it looks like it was finding ~/coffee-script
[01:50] pyrotechnick: is that intended behaviour?
[01:50] sh1mmer: ACTION goes back to writing
[01:50] SubStack: a shrew seems much more apropos
[01:50] pyrotechnick: or a side-effect of the whole local/global thing
[01:51] wafer: lol that's the rhino from the js definitive
[01:51] isaacs: pyrotechnick: are you sitting in ~/coffee-scrit?
[01:51] pyrotechnick: no im in ~

[02:50] tbranyen: dnunes: in arch i always have to go full root to install using the suggested command
[02:51] dnunes: tbranyen: The command have the "$" indicator. I shouldn't need to go root, but only this way it worked. It's messing on /user/local/bin--I think only root can change files in there.
[02:52] tbranyen: dnunes: if you install to any folder regardless what its called and you don't have permissions to write to it, its going to be a problem
[02:52] tbranyen: i don't know your system or how you have permissions set up
[02:52] dnunes: tbranyen: It's a default ubuntu 10.10.
[02:53] chrislorenz has joined the channel
[02:53] tbranyen: its also not like you can't change that installation directory either
[02:53] dnunes: tbranyen: And the install script is choosing the folder--it should check for permissions or ask for "sudo", I think.
[02:53] tbranyen: if you want to install locally without having to go root thats def possible
[02:53] tbranyen: wrong
[02:53] tbranyen: no apps install that way

[02:57] tbranyen: Its not like this is made unclear

[03:36] jaekwon: you're not returning it from the outer function

[03:37] jaekwon: you can't make an asynchronous function synchronous that way.

[03:41] ckknight: jaekwon: you monster
[03:41] Croms: thanks jae, trying to make it async, any pointers on how to achieve this?
[03:42] jaekwon: you want to pass in *another* callback into readJSONFileAsync, that gets called inside the inner callback.
[03:42] jaekwon: function readJSONFileAsync(file, callback) { … }
[03:42] jaekwon: and instead of return JSON.parse(data);, you need callback(error, JSON.parse(data))
[03:43] jaekwon: following the node.js convention
[03:44] jaekwon: now your 'readJSONFileAsync' function works like all the other node.js functions.
[03:45] Croms: never had to write my own async functions. i figured out i had to incorporate a callback in some way. any reference for conventions on nodejs.org?

[04:40] deepthawtz has joined the channel
[04:40] aaronblohowiak: cellvia: what kind of prototype chain does the object have?
[04:40] catshirt has joined the channel
[04:40] micheil: probably use a for(i < object.keys) && typeof object[key] !== 'function' && hasOwnProperty(key)
[04:40] aaronblohowiak: JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)) is a hack
[04:41] aaronblohowiak: but it works
[04:41] aaronblohowiak: =)
[04:41] jonpacker has joined the channel
[04:41] cellvia: not sure, standard i guess,  i dont define a prototype for it
[04:41] wilmoor__ has joined the channel

[04:41] cellvia: which do you think performs the fastest, micheils?
[04:41] micheil: aaronblohowiak: hmm.. were you working on things relating to websockets by any chance?
[04:42] micheil: ACTION recalls you working on something interesting, but can't recall what it was
[04:42] aaronblohowiak: Push-It and Transitive.io
[04:42] aaronblohowiak: also, i have the best JavaScript ORM of all time.
[04:42] cellvia: what orm is that?
[04:42] aaronblohowiak: cellvia: https://gist.github.com/b70b91d4cf89ce13e2e6
[04:43] cellvia: haha nice very concise
[04:43] aaronblohowiak: it works cross-platform and has no dependencies except for  JSON2 if you are in an older browser
[04:43] aaronblohowiak: cellvia: thanks.  i am trying to sell the rights to SCO

[04:47] aaronblohowiak: micheil: how do you mean?
[04:47] micheil: you have three protocols in action
[04:47] ckknight: yeah, that'd work well for this, aaronblohowiak
[04:47] cellvia: ive been messsing with js-traverse for this but im a bit of a noob
[04:47] micheil: websockets, socket-io, and bayuex
[04:47] cellvia: i will try the stringify

[04:53] throughnothing has joined the channel
[04:53] sendark has joined the channel
[04:53] aaronblohowiak: cellvia: the easiest way is probably to .clone() the object and then traverse it and strip out the functions, though that might also be the lazy way =)

[04:54] cellvia: but not sure how to actually strip out the current object in traverse

[08:22] ElDios: morning everyone
[08:23] cloudhead_: JimBastard: well, one thing you could do is not directly apply the escape codes
[08:23] cloudhead_: JimBastard: instead you convert the string into an object
[08:23] niftylettuce: Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)
[08:23] niftylettuce: XHR finished loading: "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/getFiles?user_id=42".
[08:23] cloudhead_: which has the info as properties
[08:23] cloudhead_: then you can write it however you want to either a file or stdout
[08:23] niftylettuce: http://pastie.org/private/z50i2bxherwjee176uya
[08:23] niftylettuce: and for my config in server.js

[08:24] cloudhead_: JimBastard: so 'foo'.yellow returns { string: 'foo', styling: ['yellow'] }
[08:24] techwraith: niftylettuce: try console.log(urlObj)
[08:24] techwraith: see what's in there
[08:25] JimBastard: cloudhead_: but then that breaks: console.log('foo'.yellow) right?
[08:25] JimBastard: so it would be a new api
[08:25] cloudhead_: yea
[08:25] cloudhead_: yea, if you need it for both, maybe have a diff api
[08:25] Stan____ has joined the channel
[08:25] JimBastard: i think im starting to get the idea
[08:25] JimBastard: styles and shit
[08:25] cloudhead_: or you're just gonna have to do regexps on the strings
[08:25] cloudhead_: which is kind of ugly
[08:25] niftylettuce: ReferenceError: url is not defined
[08:25] JimBastard: naah, im gonna make colors.js have multiple modes
[08:26] JimBastard: i.e. 
[08:26] cloudhead_: cool
[08:26] niftylettuce: techwraith: its the url.parse, whereas url is undefined, even though I defined in server.js
[08:26] JimBastard: directly apply or return meta-data
[08:26] JimBastard: that sounds good, right?
[08:26] cloudhead_: yea exactly
[08:26] JimBastard: aight, im gonna get on that now. anything else i should now?
[08:26] techwraith: yeah, you have to require it in the file you're working with
[08:26] techwraith: require != php include
[08:26] jesusabdullah: I'm trying to remember what winston does
[08:26] cloudhead_: well, as I said, watch out for stderr ;p
[08:27] JimBastard: jesusabdullah: multitransport logger
[08:27] JimBastard: jesusabdullah: its really nice actually
[08:27] JimBastard: you can just do winston.info('foo'), winston.warn('foo'), winston.error('foo'), winston.data('foo'), etc
[08:27] JimBastard: and its multi-tranport
[08:27] jesusabdullah: Ah, that's what I was thinking but I wasn't sure.
[08:27] JimBastard: so you point winston to the terminal or redis, or loggly, or whatever
[08:27] JimBastard: or all of them
[08:28] techwraith: JimBastard: link? I would love to use that
[08:28] jesusabdullah: I'd been kinda meaning to give it a shot but I never needed anything that needed fancy logging in node.js yet
[08:28] JimBastard: techwraith: https://github.com/indexzero/winston
[08:28] jesusabdullah: That multi-transport action sounds sweet though
[08:28] micheil: techwraith: you could also use node-logger by votizen
[08:28] niftylettuce: techwraith: huh?
[08:29] techwraith: niftylettuce: you have to require it in the same file that you're using the variable in
[08:29] techwraith: micheil: I'm currently using tj's log.js

[08:30] cellvia: anyone know any notable caveats to coding in coffeescript?
[08:30] niftylettuce: techwraith: :) :) :) <3 <3 <3 <3
[08:30] techwraith: :)
[08:30] ckknight: cellvia: makes debugging harder
[08:30] micheil: cellvia: debugging is slightly impaired
[08:30] techwraith: Victory!
[08:30] micheil: you get reference line numbers of javascript, not coffeescript
[08:30] techwraith: And with that, I'm going to bed, goodnight all :)
[08:30] cellvia: gotcha, any ways around it?
[08:31] cloudhead_: cellvia: it's harder to make it not return a value
[08:31] cellvia: for functions?
[08:31] cloudhead_: yeh
[08:31] cellvia: gotcha
[08:31] jesusabdullah: cellvia: As a corollary to what cloudhead said, some javascript libraries may get confused if you try to use them from coffeescript due to behavior like, "always returns last line" and such
[08:32] cloudhead_: yea that ^
[08:32] cellvia: doesnt coffeescript leave normally coded JS alone though?
[08:33] jesusabdullah: Yeah, but if your library expects to not have something return, for example, or has special behavior for returns or whatever the case
[08:33] jesusabdullah: then things can get confusing
[08:33] jesusabdullah: Sometimes you will see patches to javascript projects so that using them from within coffee works better
[08:34] jesusabdullah: for example, for a while node-seq was tough to use with cofee-script, either because of returns or treatment of "this" or something. I don't really remember much about the issue OR coffeescript's SNAFUs, truth be told.
[08:34] tanepiper: ryah: +1 for code coverage tools :D
[08:34] jesusabdullah: But the point is, some of the more clever js libraries can get tripped up
[08:35] jesusabdullah: Actually, tanepiper would be the one to talk to about that
[08:35] jesusabdullah: He knows CS well, AND has worked with node-seq
[08:35] cellvia: thanks tho, that sounds like potentially big/annoying issue
[08:36] cellvia: considering how many libraries im using
[08:36] jesusabdullah: All that said, coffeescript is a very nice project. If you think it looks compelling I'd say to give it a shot and see what happens!
[08:36] jesusabdullah: Well, most libraries don't end up being problematic
[08:36] cellvia: yeah, its hard to resist some of their examples
[08:36] JimBastard: which logger micheil ?
[08:36] jesusabdullah: It's maybe 5%
[08:36] V1: cloudhead_ / cloudhead / cloudhead<numberhere> Did you manage to solve your socket.io client.request issues?
[08:36] jesusabdullah: if that
[08:36] micheil: the one on the votizen github
[08:36] JimBastard: which one?
[08:36] micheil: may be called votizen-logger
[08:36] cellvia: i will give it a shot :)
[08:36] jesusabdullah: Seriously: If you think it looks compelling, try it and see what you think
[08:36] JimBastard: https://github.com/votizen/logger ?
[08:36] cloudhead_: V1: no I haven't really tried anything
[08:36] micheil: think so.
[08:36] niftylettuce: okay so I have <div class="row first"></div> and some <div class="row"></div>, how do I target only the divs with class="row" versus both row and first
[08:36] JimBastard: Dude, come on...
[08:36] niftylettuce: o wrong chan i guess..?
[08:36] cloudhead_: V1: I don't want to go too deep in non-api land
[08:37] JimBastard: It has no docs and no features :-(
[08:37] V1: cloudhead_: oki
[08:37] JimBastard: At least write docs!
[08:37] jesusabdullah: What has no docs?
[08:37] JimBastard: https://github.com/votizen/logger 
[08:37] micheil: JimBastard: it was one of the last things I wrote before leaving the company.
[08:37] V1: who needs docs when you can read the code ;D
[08:37] micheil: also, there's jsdoc in the code.
[08:37] techwraith: niftylettuce: $(".row").not(".first")
[08:38] cellvia: niftylettuce: jQuery('.row:not("first")') something like that
[08:38] jesusabdullah: ooh, no readme :(
[08:38] cellvia: niftylettuce: jQuery('.row:not(".first")') something like that
[08:38] jesusabdullah: BAD SIGN ;_;
[08:38] V1: just run dox over it, as it has JSDoc comments ._."

[08:39] cloudhead_: micheil: what are your plans with websocket-server?
[08:39] jesusabdullah: Like, 3 libraries that do very similar things
[08:39] sholmes: was 0.4.6 just released today?
[08:40] V1: sholmes: yesterday i think
[08:40] sholmes: the 14th, which was, technically, and two hours ago for me.
[08:40] sholmes: But that's rad.
[08:41] V1: yay for timezones :)
[08:42] sholmes: Woot!
[08:42] sholmes: Anyway. How can I be apart of the Node community more?
[08:42] micheil: cloudhead_: version 2.0.0 will be coming out in the next few months.
[08:43] micheil: cloudhead_: see: https://github.com/miksago/node-websocket-server/issues/milestones
[08:43] cloudhead_: micheil: cool, so you intend to make it the standard for ws on node, right?
[08:44] cloudhead_: micheil: I take it node-websocket-protocol isn't released yet?
[08:45] micheil: cloudhead_: bbl, really busy with some other stuff right now
[08:45] cloudhead_: ok

[08:46] kuebk: you guys know anything faster than jsdom?
[08:47] indutny: kuebk: regexp
[08:48] sholmes: Wait nevermind, it's because I need to have my localhost running because I need to use the mysql server.
[08:48] indutny: kuebk: depends on what are you going to do
[08:48] A_Nub: sholmes: give us the backtrace.
[08:48] A_Nub: its more usable.
[08:49] sholmes: A_Nub: Well, I figured out that it only happens when I don't run Wamp. I'm assuming this is because my Node app needs to access the data from the Wamp's MySQL database.
[08:49] A_Nub: ok
[08:50] sholmes: A_Nub: however, if I wanted a stack such as Linux/Node/Mysql only (no apache) then how would I get mysql to run on it's own?
[08:50] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[08:50] A_Nub: mySql can run alone
[08:51] sholmes: You see. I'm not even aware of how Wamp does it's thing. I think it just runs apache, and apache has a way of allowing modules on top of it.
[08:51] sholmes: Mysql and PHP are both apache modules that run when apache runs.
[08:52] sholmes: But with Node, I wouldn't know how to get MySQL to run either alone, or start up when I run my Node app.
[08:52] A_Nub: i have mySQL that runs alone
[08:52] micheil: cloudhead_: no, it's not released yet, but there have been early gists of it.
[08:52] A_Nub: node doesnt start the mySQL server
[08:52] A_Nub: you would do that in a shell
[08:52] deebo: mysql is not a apache module

[08:52] pdelgallego has joined the channel
[08:52] A_Nub: what deebo said.
[08:52] sholmes: How do you have it run alone?
[08:52] A_Nub: mySQL is a server.
[08:53] deebo: its a database server, standalone
[08:53] sholmes: I see.
[08:53] micheil: cloudhead_: as for node-websocket-protocol, it'll be a generic encoder/decoder for the protocol, as well as implementing the relevant handshaking algorithms.
[08:53] sholmes: However, how does Wamp start up MySQL it seems at the same time as it starts Apache?
[08:53] kuebk: indutny want to have full DOM server side
[08:53] stephank has joined the channel
[08:53] micheil: sholmes: for running mysql, you should look for the relevant information in the mysql documentation
[08:53] A_Nub: usually something like
[08:53] sholmes: Is there some kind of middleman program that starts them up and handles their processes?
[08:53] A_Nub:  
[08:53] A_Nub:  /etc/init.d/mysqld start
[08:54] deebo: sholmes: some trickery via a middleware
[08:54] micheil: a WAMP stack simply runs the scripts that start up the various parts of a WAMP stack.
[08:54] A_Nub: indeed
[08:54] stephank has joined the channel
[08:54] Noviets: Whats the best way to get my own js> bot for a different server?
[08:54] A_Nub: sholmes:  what system are you on?
[08:54] micheil: A_Nub: probably windows, considering they are refering to a WAMP stack
[08:54] sholmes: Makes sense. Theoretically, could I have my app check if the mysql server is running, and if not, start it up?
[08:55] micheil: sholmes: it's not a wise idea to do that.
[08:55] A_Nub: micheil: oh yeah forgot that the OS X version is called MAMP
[08:55] deebo: sholmes: you should assume it is running
[08:55] A_Nub: yea
[08:55] A_Nub: assume
[08:55] sholmes: A_Nub: I'm on a Windows system, however, I'd like to build my application for debian/ubuntu (hopefully keeping this sort of dev workflow working)
[08:55] A_Nub: also
[08:56] micheil: sholmes: if you're having troubles with databases, there are a number of hosted database solutions, such as AWS RDS, Redistogo, MongoHQ and others
[08:56] A_Nub: well on ubuntu add it to your startup scripts
[08:56] sholmes: micheil: my next question was whether it was a good idea. Thanks for being on the forefront on that. ;)
[08:56] A_Nub: and add a maitain to it
[08:56] A_Nub: so it makes sure its running.
[08:56] micheil: if you want to build your application on debian/ubuntu, then you should be able to use an ubuntu server image in a virtual machine
[08:56] deebo: on ubuntu/debian if you just `apt-get install mysql-server` by default it will always be on
[08:56] d0k has joined the channel
[08:57] micheil: as you go through the install process, it'll actually ask you if you want to configure the system with mysql.
[08:57] A_Nub: ya
[08:57] sholmes: I suppose the database will eventually make it's way onto it's own box, seperate from the server.
[08:58] micheil: sholmes: perhaps, if you need to do that.
[08:58] liquidproof has joined the channel
[08:58] micheil: very small applications may not require this, but as any application grows, it's resource usage increases, so it may be the right thing to do.
[08:58] sholmes: deebo, micheil: good to know. I think on my VPS, that is what it does; I did apt-get it and it's running independently from apache2.
[08:59] deebo: as it should
[08:59] deebo: theres absolutely no relation between the two
[08:59] micheil: yes, databases always run independent of apache2
[08:59] sholmes: I understand now. :)
[08:59] A_Nub: its almost like it was designed that way, huh
[08:59] A_Nub: :P
[08:59] micheil: minds you, if you front node.js with apache2, you loose some of the benefits of node.js
[09:00] deebo: how so? if you just load balance?
[09:00] A_Nub: why run apache and node?
[09:00] A_Nub: thats silly.
[09:00] micheil: because, apache is a thread based server, node is a event loop based.
[09:00] micheil: apache = 1 thread per connection
[09:00] sholmes: I should start to think of mysql as it's own thing, rather than a stacked solution like WAMP or LAMP; I should just think that my stack is LNM, but each part is independent. I should get to know mysql's as it's own program, etc.
[09:01] micheil: node = 1 process / 1 thread
[09:01] deebo: micheil: yeah yeah, but how do you "correctly" load balance then
[09:01] A_Nub: micheil: you could write a node server to duplicate itself and handle the new connection on an new port :)
[09:01] sholmes: I plan on a complete Node stack; no apache.
[09:01] A_Nub: viola
[09:01] micheil: deebo: well, a) your node.js application can handle quite a lot of direct traffic
[09:02] micheil: and b) you can load balance with things like AWS's ELB or front it with a NGINX or HAProxy configuration
[09:02] A_Nub: I think and event based loop is better
[09:02] A_Nub: first come first server
[09:02] micheil: or, any other industry standard load balancer
[09:02] A_Nub: also
[09:02] micheil: apache is not a load balancer
[09:02] A_Nub: it avoids a possible problem
[09:02] deebo: micheil: true, but on a 4 core system itll employ one core barring some modules that use the threadpool
[09:02] A_Nub: of two threads editing data
[09:02] A_Nub: while ones reading
[09:02] A_Nub: or what not
[09:02] micheil: deebo: there are solutions like Cluster from Learnboost that will let you use all 4 cores.
[09:03] micheil: but you'll essentially only listen on one port.
[09:03] ebaxt has joined the channel
[09:03] A_Nub: I think node is better than apache in many ways
[09:03] path[l] has joined the channel
[09:03] A_Nub: mostly in the way that its programmable ;)
[09:03] sholmes: How should errors be handled in Node? When my application has an error, is it default that the entire application process falls, and my site goes down?
[09:04] sholmes: by falls, I mean that the process dies.
[09:04] A_Nub: Best error handling = don't make errors ;)
[09:04] micheil: sholmes: you should be building your application in a way such that your watching for applicable error codes
[09:04] teemow has joined the channel
[09:04] micheil: as for other random errors, on an ubuntu system you can use Upstart to manage the process and ensure that it is always running.
[09:05] A_Nub: Sholmes also you should try to test rigirously before public deployment.
[09:05] sholmes: micheil: how so, wrap everything in try catch statement?
[09:05] micheil: sholmes: try catch doesn't work in node.
[09:05] A_Nub: install an exception handler?
[09:05] micheil: or doesn't work as effectively.
[09:05] sholmes: A_Nub: true too, but things aren't always that smooth.
[09:05] Shinuza has left the channel
[09:05] micheil: sholmes: for instance, a http request has an "error" event, you should be listening for this.
[09:06] A_Nub: exactly.
[09:06] Noviets has joined the channel
[09:06] A_Nub: its similar to an exception handler.
[09:07] micheil: sholmes: you can also use products like getexceptional to be able to have emails sent to you when your node.js application throws an uncaught error
[09:07] sholmes: Hmm, so if I listen to this event, this will allow me to catch HTTP errors. But, HTTP errors from the HTTP module are handled for me. What am I to do about errors that kill the process?
[09:08] A_Nub: fatal errors?
[09:08] A_Nub: those would be your fault
[09:08] A_Nub: just fix the code
[09:08] sholmes: A_Nub: I suppose that's the correct term.
[09:08] A_Nub: you should be value and data checking.
[09:08] A_Nub: to avoid such problems.
[09:08] sholmes: I see. So as long as I'm coding correctly, then I shouldn't worry about something like that unexpectedly occuring.
[09:09] A_Nub: thats the idea
[09:09] sholmes: A_Nub: so then, what are some common slip ups that I could trip over? :P
[09:09] A_Nub: its part of the development cycle.
[09:09] A_Nub: finding where potential errors may occur
[09:09] A_Nub: and making safgaurds.
[09:09] A_Nub: safe*
[09:10] micheil: sholmes: you should consider it that your application will always be error prone, and in the case of that eventuality you should be prepared to handle that.
[09:10] A_Nub: most common  = null or out of scope or expired data.
[09:10] micheil: this is the same with any programming language or server environment
[09:10] A_Nub: yes
[09:10] A_Nub: Simple programming theory right there.
[09:11] sholmes: What are considered fatel errors; how can I make the distiction within my code. In other words, just by looking at the code, how can I be able to see where a potential fatel error may occur?
[09:11] A_Nub: var bob = lol;
[09:11] micheil: fatal errors will happen any where that an error may occur.
[09:11] A_Nub: bob.hehe = function(){}
[09:11] A_Nub: delete bob
[09:11] micheil: any uncaught errors will be fatal errors.
[09:11] A_Nub: bob.hehe();
[09:11] micheil: node.js follows a bit of a fail fast mentality.
[09:12] A_Nub: yea
[09:12] sholmes: Ah, so JavaScript errors, such as foo.length where foo is null.
[09:12] A_Nub: yes
[09:12] A_Nub: those are the most common
[09:12] A_Nub: other errors are most likely logic errors
[09:12] A_Nub: where you dont get the expected result
[09:12] A_Nub: which is nonfatal.
[09:12] micheil: other errors are things like trying to read a file that does not exist, process being out of memory, etc.
[09:12] micheil: too many file descriptors open
[09:13] A_Nub: exactly.
[09:13] micheil: ECONNRESET
[09:13] micheil: etc.
[09:13] sholmes: These errors can occur quite often in client-side code. However, the consiquences of this kind of error in client-side code, is not as radical as a server shut down.
[09:13] A_Nub: it is in some browsers.
[09:13] micheil: actually, they are pretty much the same.
[09:13] A_Nub: Safari follows a fail fast.
[09:13] A_Nub: IE tries to push past errors
[09:13] A_Nub: not sure about FF and CHROME
[09:14] A_Nub: Either way you should never get errors.
[09:14] A_Nub: Errors means you coded poorly
[09:14] A_Nub: Bugs are ok
[09:14] sholmes: True, if my client-side script does have an error like this, the rest of the script doesn't execute. However, other pages that work fine, will continue to do so.
[09:14] A_Nub: but errors are unacceptable.
[09:14] A_Nub: Because each page is  a new instance.
[09:15] sholmes: A_Nub: duly noted
[09:15] bzinger has joined the channel
[09:15] A_Nub: Its like coding a c function that takes a pointer
[09:15] A_Nub: but never checking if that pointer is valid.
[09:15] micheil: man. fco.gov.uk is one slow site.
[09:16] sholmes: So a, what sort of JavaScript errors will not kill the process, but will echo out in the console?
[09:16] micheil: all errors that are uncaught will kill the process.
[09:16] A_Nub: yes.
[09:16] A_Nub: Errors = fatal
[09:16] A_Nub: Bugs = Non fatal.
[09:17] A_Nub: Bugs are usually flawed logic
[09:17] micheil: Bugs tend to be errors in most cases though
[09:17] micheil: or can lead to errors.
[09:17] A_Nub: yes.
[09:17] A_Nub: I classify those as errors.
[09:17] A_Nub: When I say bug
[09:17] A_Nub: I usually mean something non fatal
[09:17] sholmes: Hard distiction for me to make.
[09:18] A_Nub: well imagine you try to replace characters in a string
[09:18] A_Nub: but you replace on of them wrong
[09:18] A_Nub: and it doesn't work right
[09:18] micheil: sholmes: as you begin to program with node.js, you will soon begin to realise what a fatal error is and what a non-fatal problem is.
[09:18] A_Nub: so instead of changing mom to bob it does mom to dod
[09:18] A_Nub: and makes no sense.
[09:19] sholmes: I see, it's where I made an error in the logic, not the syntax.
[09:19] A_Nub: Syntax =  instant fatal.
[09:19] sholmes: In other words, the program is functioning correctly as it's told, but I didn't tell it to do it as I intended.
[09:19] A_Nub: fatal usually means you are trying to access something that is invalid.
[09:19] A_Nub: yes
[09:20] A_Nub: that would be a non fatal
[09:20] micheil: for instance, if you try to connect to a database, but that database is down, and you don't watch for a net.Socket error event, then you'll crash your application.

[09:20] A_Nub: but if you do check for the error
[09:20] A_Nub: and the db is down
[09:20] sholmes: A_Nub: from your example, there wouldn't be any log on this kind of error, rather, it would just be an obvious problem.
[09:20] A_Nub: its a bug, mainly being missing content.

[09:21] sholmes: A_Nub: true too.

[09:21] sholmes: A_Nub: but a fault would be noticed sooner or later, the bug will be brought to the surface.
[09:22] sholmes: A_Nub: same time here.
[09:22] A_Nub: But finding its origin can be tough.
[09:22] sholmes: That's why I am in bed. lol
[09:22] A_Nub: I need a new laptop
[09:22] sholmes: A_Nub: understandably.

[09:24] sholmes: Mac or PC?
[09:24] A_Nub: Powerbook, mac.
[09:24] cloudhead_: micheil: well I'm glad someone is taking care of this, it's really needed : )
[09:24] A_Nub: the batteries were free
[09:24] A_Nub: and I got the recall for it
[09:24] sholmes: Wow, didn't know it was only 6 yrs ago that they were called that.
[09:24] jacter has joined the channel
[09:24] A_Nub: but only last year.
[09:24] A_Nub: so I said screw it.
[09:25] A_Nub: Yeah I have the last powerbook model
[09:25] A_Nub: I have it setup as a server
[09:25] A_Nub: :P
[09:25] sholmes: The only downside to buying a mac, is that it get's outdated fast.
[09:25] micheil: cloudhead_: the aim of node-websocket-protocol is to provide generic encoding/decoding of drafts 75, 76, and 06. This library will easily be able to be used by both websocket servers, (including socket.io), and websocket clients.
[09:25] A_Nub: sholmes: what?
[09:25] A_Nub: my iMac is 2008 and only the gfx card is outdated
[09:26] sholmes: well, I suppose that's inevitable with ever computer.
[09:26] A_Nub: and maybe since its ddr2.
[09:26] sholmes: what I mean, is there's always something better.
[09:26] A_Nub: other than that its CPU is still considered quite good.
[09:26] A_Nub: and its screen is above exceptional
[09:26] A_Nub: sholmes: same with pc's
[09:26] sholmes: yeah
[09:26] A_Nub: its the tech world
[09:26] A_Nub: There is always something new.
[09:26] sholmes: Your right.
[09:27] cloudhead_: micheil: the decoupling is a great idea
[09:27] A_Nub: I just prefer products that are designed from the ground up.
[09:27] sholmes: However, I wish that we only had to buy a terminal sort of system, and paid a subscription fee for a cloud based hardware. Then just have that update as time goes.
[09:28] A_Nub: thats only logical for files and databases I think.
[09:28] A_Nub: cloud gaming
[09:28] A_Nub: seems like a bad idea
[09:28] A_Nub: then again

[15:27] ElDios: besides this, nice.. =)
[15:27] perela: hi, anybody here to answer stupid questions?
[15:27] perela: :-)
[15:27] llkazu: "save this big-ass object to a file, and when reloading it, have all functions inside the object recompile properly and be executable"
[15:27] ElDios: go for it perela 
[15:28] perela: doing my first steps with node. i'm writing an upload based on felix' formidable
[15:28] devdazed: llkazu: you would have to check each item in the object to see if it is a function, then call tostring on it
[15:28] ElDios: XtraLOL.. it's on grooveshark too! XD
[15:28] ElDios: (speaking of "I'm on a boat")
[15:28] llkazu: ugh, fantastic. i was afraid of that.
[15:28] devdazed: then when recompiling it, you can do Function(string)()
[15:28] perela: i want to implement a progress bar.... i think i know how to make a basic implementation. however i wonder, when polling the upload status from the server, how to identify the client's upload among the possibly many concurrent ones
[15:29] jacobolus has joined the channel
[15:29] perela: what's the most reliable method i wonder
[15:29] ElDios: I pass over this.. since I'm quite interested in hearing the answer :) n00b here
[15:30] llkazu: perela, poll for a specific download ID?
[15:30] andi5 has joined the channel
[15:30] perela: so i submit the id from the client to the server in the beginning and bind the progress to that id
[15:31] llkazu: that could work, ya. though personally i'd actually use socket.io to do the progress bar magic. get an upload ID from the server via socket.io (or nowjs or dnode, which are RPC mechanisms built on socket.io)
[15:31] llkazu: add that ID to the upload form
[15:31] llkazu: then either poll the server for a progress update via socket.io/whatever, OR even better (if you can) have the server PUSH updates to the client via the same mechanism
[15:32] perela: i've encountered this suggestion on stackoverflow, however i don't really know what socket.io really is.

[15:33] llkazu: perela, http://nowjs.com/ check this out
[15:33] perela: thx
[15:33] llkazu: basically you define functions on the server side, and on the client side.
[15:33] devdazed: llkazu: check this out http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3685703/javascript-stringify-object-including-members-of-type-function

[16:15] ckknight_: DennisRasmussen: part of me wants to recreate the minecraft server using node.js
[16:16] ckknight_: since the current servercode is ... lacking
[16:16] tmedema: Hi folks. I'm trying to stream audio from browser A to browser B, by proxying the stream through a node.js server. Flash audio players can only stream an audio file by streaming a given URL.Thus, I first need to establish such stream connection from browser B to the server. Then, client A has to stream to server. Then, the server has to use the already opened stream to browser B to pipe client A's data to it.
[16:16] tmedema: Did that message get cut off by a char limit?
[16:16] DennisRasmussen: ckknight, awesome. I've already built a canvas engine for 2D :)
[16:16] ckknight_: tmedema: didn't appear to be
[16:16] ckknight_: DennisRasmussen: I probably won't do it, tbh.
[16:16] DennisRasmussen: 3D in 2D actually (2.5D)
[16:16] ajpiaNOU has joined the channel

[16:17] prettyrobots has joined the channel
[16:18] DennisRasmussen: ckknight_, you around in this channel much or? I'll poke you once in a while. Good to see someone you know with the same interest :)
[16:18] ckknight_: tmedema: well, client A makes a request on a particular URL, then you should be able to just read the input stream in. Buffer that stream and when client B connects, send out the bits.
[16:18] ckknight_: DennisRasmussen: I am
[16:19] tmedema: ckknight_: I know. The question is what kind of data does flash expect, should it be binary stuff as a string or something?
[16:19] ckknight_: that I don't know, but I both hope and assume it's binary.
[16:19] tmedema: ckknight_: well javascript cannot contain binary within variables right?

[16:21] joshthecoder has joined the channel
[16:21] ckknight_: yeah, you'd basically just start doing a bunch of response.write's
[16:21] tmedema: ckknight_: you make it sound like it's an easy task
[16:21] ckknight_: ...yes?
[16:21] tmedema: what about the content type etc that the flash app is expecting?
[16:21] ckknight_: I don't know that, look at flash's docs
[16:22] marcosvm has joined the channel
[16:23] tmedema: ckknight_: so how does such streaming player request a pause etc.?
[16:24] jacobolus has joined the channel
[16:24] ckknight_: I have never done such a thing, you'll have to look at flash's docs
[16:24] ckknight_: I don't even know whether it assumes half or full duplex.
[16:25] tmedema: I figured there have to be standards because I also have to support html5 players etc.
[16:25] ckknight_: html5 <video> doesn't _really_ support streaming in the same regard, though it can be faked

[16:29] akashiraffee: tmedema: not a flash programmer and so haven't done it before, but you can use setVariable to send data to flash, such as i guess some Buffer content, also vice versa, qv. swLiveConnect and fsCommand() -- nb. this info maybe out of date...
[16:29] kevliu: i am trying to launch a non-trivial node.js app into production

[16:30] kevliu: thanks!
[16:30] b0t has joined the channel
[16:30] tmedema: akashiraffee: the issue is that flash does not allow you to play binary data
[16:30] tmedema: it only allows you to pass a URL
[16:30] tmedema: so I cannot simply use websockets or something
[16:30] kevliu: as it usually goes... everything is perfectly fine on my dev machine :) however, when trying to put it on a production VM, there are major stability issues..
[16:30] jeffmoss has left the channel
[16:30] ckknight_: kevliu: your own server or a cloud thing?
[16:30] EyePulp: kevliu: what's your production stack look like?
[16:31] kevliu: after 6 or 7 users the site becomes unresponsive. is there a checklist of major caveats that i've been missing? the team has just been focused on feature implementation..
[16:31] suckerpunch has joined the channel
[16:31] dmcquay has joined the channel
[16:31] kevliu: the production server for now is a VM in our own data center. it just runs a single node.js process, and all data is pulled via rpc from other servers
[16:31] davidsklar has joined the channel
[16:31] jacobolus has joined the channel
[16:31] kevliu: there is also an instance of redis on that same VM for caching
[16:32] EyePulp: kevliu: does the server as a whole become unresponsive or simply the node app?  e.g. is ssh still speedy and acessible when things slow down?
[16:32] ckknight_: kevliu: and you're doing proper async calls, right?
[16:32] kevliu: we were using connect-redis as a session storage engine, but i think there's a bug in that package-- it sets the sessions way too many times, so we switched back to the default in-memory store
[16:32] kevliu: that's correct, everything is async.
[16:32] kevliu: nothing blocks, everything is written with callbacks
[16:32] tmedema: use a debugger, see if things like json parsers are blocking

[16:40] tbranyen: a|i: can you increase the jobs for the build process?

[16:47] kevliu: doesn't show line, calling process, or anything..
[16:47] kevliu: is there a global catch sort of thing we can do?
[16:47] ckknight_: oh my
[16:47] ckknight_: kevliu: on startup or during it running?
[16:47] kevliu: during it running, after a few users pop on..
[16:47] kevliu: Uncaught exception: SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[16:47] ckknight_: probably JSON.
[16:47] mikegerwitz: kevliu: :/ I'm not sure catching a syntax error is the best idea to do. process.on( 'uncaughtException' ) would work, but run jslint or something
[16:48] ckknight_: kevliu: and if you run something like cluster (which I linked before), it will restart the worker apps if they die.
[16:48] jonaslund has joined the channel
[16:48] EyePulp: kevliu: put cluster in front of it, even with one worker

[16:49] jaekwon: any good guides i can read up beforehand? I do know C
[16:49] jaekwon: maybe best practices
[16:50] mikegerwitz: jaekwon: along with bison, flex, lemon, etc
[16:50] tjholowaychuk: uhmm, well there are quite a few ways you could go about it
[16:50] tjholowaychuk: but yah look into ragel/re2c/lemon/blahblah
[16:50] tjholowaychuk: for parsing
[16:50] jaekwon: cool.
[16:50] ckknight_: as an example, Rubinius (a ruby runner) switched from C to C++, but set up very strict guidelines about what not to use in C++
[16:50] EyePulp: kevliu: so this is a major consumer site, and you've rebuilt it all on node, or just a part of it?  I'm curious because you say you may go live very shortly, but these sort of deployment questions are really fundamental to ironing out before going live... like long before.
[16:50] EyePulp: =)
[16:50] necromancer: hi, i have an idea for a project/framework using node.js...where would i go to find people who want to work with me?
[16:50] necromancer: (it's free/open-source)
[16:50] jaekwon: thanks, and love you all.
[16:50] mikegerwitz: jaekwon: If you don't know C, you're going to have a hard time writing a parser/compiler. K&R is an excellent book to read
[16:50] ckknight_: jaekwon: the feeling is surely mutual
[16:50] jaekwon: i know C :) 
[16:51] jaekwon: and yes ccknight. in a platonic way of course.
[16:51] ckknight_: well, not from my end.

[16:53] mtn360: Hello everyone! Does anybody have a working example on how to calculate the key/iv for the crypto.createDecipheriv method? 
[16:55] mtn360: Tried "crypto.createHash('md5').update(decrypt_pass).digest('hex');" for the key part… Keylength has at least the right length (32) for aes-256-cbc. 
[16:55] mikegerwitz: mtn360: Depends on what encrypted it ;)

[16:56] mikegerwitz: mtn360: Were you the one trying to decrypt block N of an aes stream or am I thinking of yet antoher guy?
[16:56] mtn360: openssl aes-256-cbc -in uncrypted.txt -out crypted.txt -e -nosalt … was used to crypt the file, i try do decrypt instream :-)
[16:56] mtn360: that was me :-)
[16:56] mtn360: with the IV offset.
[16:56] mikegerwitz: mtn360: Any luck?
[16:57] mikegerwitz: mtn360: Ahh; so is this the same problem or slightly different?
[16:57] mtn360: Decrypting the file in stream works just fine with crypto.createDecipher() … but no luck on reading the file partially …
[16:57] mtn360: Still same same ;-)
[16:58] mikegerwitz: mtn360: Ah, damn :) Yeah when you mentioned that I was thinking of your previous issue. The source didn't turn anything up?

[17:13] jonaslund: how do you guys usually let content editors work?
[17:13] mjr_: tjholowaychuk: dude, nedis is crazy
[17:13] kevliu: redis was doing some strange stuff when i was using connect-redis -- all i did was specify it as the store; 
[17:14] kevliu: fired up redis-cli and ran monitor

[17:18] mjr_: At least now when you figure out how to write your software that way, you can easily feed it massive computing power 
[17:18] jacobolus has joined the channel
[17:18] ckknight_: mjr_: I suppose. Maybe it's just that in my job I've had to do so much scalability work that that's just how I think now.
[17:19] mjr_: I am currently marveling at how much faster bare metal computers are than even the fastest "cloud" instances.
[17:19] mtn360: mikegerwitz: thanks for the php sample. looks like it can be helpful...
[17:19] box2: scalable to those extents means opening sockets and serializing data between servers
[17:19] box2: it's not as terrible as you'd think
[17:19] EyePulp: building for a scale you *may* need *someday* is good way to waste time and money
[17:20] box2: in node even if you want to use multiple cores on your single cpu you have to do it that way
[17:20] box2: so it's basically already setting you up for maximum growth potential
[17:20] ckknight_: EyePulp: it depends on what you put into it, I'd say. If you are able to prepare without much hard work in doing so, then there's no good reason to not make things "scalable". If it does take hard work, figure out how to alleviate that.
[17:21] jonaslund: scalability for most simple sites is one thing
[17:21] EyePulp: ckknight: I'll agree with that
[17:21] jonaslund: but once your app starts doing complex stuff or have difficult relations then it might not be as clear cut

[18:25] perezd: that one
[18:25] perezd: can it be any case?
[18:25] Kami_: perezd: oh, setUp than :)
[18:25] lenard_alm has left the channel
[18:25] perezd: ah, setup 
[18:25] perezd: the terminology is init
[18:25] Kami_: perezd: it get's passed a callback which you must call when you are done with the stuff in setUp

[18:35] mikegerwitz: johnnywengluu: Developers write systems. It doesn't really make sense to be a developer that has no idea how to compile and install software.
[18:35] tbranyen: micheil: if ever am in a situation where internet is not available, i freak out
[18:35] johnnywengluu: the need is there!
[18:35] adulteratedjedi: a developer who cannot set up their dev environment is not a very good developer .. no?
[18:36] tbranyen: lol calling in sys admin to compile my code for me
[18:36] johnnywengluu: you shouldn't have to
[18:36] mikegerwitz: tbranyen: lol
[18:36] johnnywengluu: what you really want to is to code the app logic
[18:36] tbranyen: ticket: 4233 code won't compile WONTFIX
[18:36] micheil: johnnywengluu: heroku became a success mainly because it simplifed a bit of the deployment process to production, not because it made your development not need you to setup your development tools

[18:36] johnnywengluu: since dev env is almost the same .. like packages .. "im using RoR, ruby, git bla bla"

[18:37] johnnywengluu: there are 1000 000 more devs using that stack .. nothing unique
[18:37] johnnywengluu: micheil: heroku is just a first step
[18:37] adulteratedjedi: I agree with micheil 
[18:37] johnnywengluu: towards the correct direction
[18:37] johnnywengluu: you think it'll stop there?
[18:37] micheil: there is always still a need to know how to setup basic things like your environment
[18:37] johnnywengluu: it never stops
[18:38] johnnywengluu: or i just buy a computer and use it

Hell, every developer should understand how a PC works. I've met far too many developers who can't explain what a bit is.

[18:40] mikegerwitz: johnnywengluu: has nothing to do with assembly ;)
[18:40] micheil: johnnywengluu: agreed, you don't need to understand every detail, but you must appreciate every detail
[18:40] johnnywengluu: micheil: dont have time for every detail
[18:40] micheil: then why are you a programmer?

[18:50] isaacs: wink_: that is the custom, yes

[18:52] wink_: brianc: thats exactly where it'd fail, finding the odbc libs
[18:53] brianc: wink_: i actually continue to install the package without libpq installed though because it has fall-back pure javascript bindings. 
[18:53] pyrotechnick1: can i just require('node.js') or do i need to encapsulate the http?
[18:53] wink_: brianc: did you fork ryah's bindings?

[18:54] jetheredge has joined the channel
[18:54] pyrotechnick1: Twisol: if you encapsulate the http you should be able to just require('node.js')
[18:54] brianc: wink_: no I started with pure javascript
[18:55] Twisol: pyrotechnick1, eh what? that wasn't my question
[18:55] jacobolus has joined the channel
[18:55] brianc: once I had ~200 tests passing & the entire client protocol implemented & working
[18:55] brianc: I started on the libpq bindings
[18:55] pyrotechnick1: Twisol: trust me
[18:55] brianc: at that point i _heavily_ referenced ry's bindings
[18:55] wink_: drudge: hopefully soon i can revisit some of the mongo binding deficiencies, you're watching that one yeah?
[18:55] Twisol: pyrotechnick1, http has nothing to do with my C++ extension.
[18:55] Twisol: pyrotechnick1, it's a Telnet parser.
[18:55] wink_: brianc: ah ok.  is there a way to prevent yours from falling back to the js implementation?
[18:56] wink_: and just failing instead?
[18:56] aheckmann has joined the channel
[18:56] brianc: yeah totally
[18:56] pyrotechnick1: Twisol: that's your problem. you need to encapsulate the http before you can extend c++
[18:56] Twisol: ...I think I'm being trolled >_>
[18:57] brianc: wink_: it's extra work to make it so node-waf fails and the module still installs via npm
[18:57] drudge: wink_: yeah, i was watching the odbc stuff too but went a different route
[18:57] wink_: drudge: booo ;>
[18:57] brianc: wink_: https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/blob/master/package.json#L14

[18:58] dguttman_ has joined the channel
[18:58] brianc: wink_: if I didn't include " || true" at the end of the install script line, missing libpq would cause node-waf to have a non-zero exit code & npm would abort the installation (which I think is the behavior you're looking for with node-odbc)
[18:59] wink_: brianc: perfect, thanks!  the pq binding looks nice too, i'll give it a go
[18:59] wink_: i hate bugging ryah about his since thats probably the last thing on his mind
[18:59] brianc: wink_: it's the hotness!  it's used in production @ at least one place I know of
[19:00] wink_: i'll dig into it for sure, as long as i can force it to fail on not having libpq available, that'll be golden
[19:00] jacobolus has joined the channel
[19:00] brianc: yeah ryah's got bigger fish to fry than postgres bindings
[19:01] wink_: ah ok, so its in the require with .native
[19:01] brianc: yeah
[19:01] wink_: perfect
[19:01] brianc: require('pg') brings in pure javascript w
[19:01] isaacs: brianc: you fall back to the purejs one if libpg isn't there, right?
[19:01] dguttman has joined the channel
[19:01] brianc: require('pg').native <-- same API, using libpq
[19:01] wink_: have you benchmarked the js version against the libpq binding?
[19:02] brianc: yeah, i have
[19:02] wink_: how'd it come out?
[19:02] brianc: isaacs: it still installs, but if you require('pg') and access the 'native' property you get an error since you were unable to compile.  I should add a nicer error message about that
[19:02] isaacs: i see
[19:03] brianc: since the pure javascript was done first and works everywhere node works it's the 'default' and you have to 'opt-in' to use libpq bindings for now
[19:03] isaacs: brianc: it might also be nice to wrap that build command up in a shell script, so that you can do `npm config set pg:require-native true` and then test for $npm_package_config_require_native=="true" in your script
[19:04] ngs has joined the channel
[19:04] brianc: isaacs: so that way if libpq bindings doon't build the install fails?
[19:05] isaacs: brianc: the reason i suggest that is that i'm doing some work to be able to pre-build binary packages for specific arch's, and pre-built packages wont' run their preinstall/install scripts.  so, if it succeeds, but trivially, i probably don't want to have a "prebuilt" version that didn't actually build anythign
[19:05] isaacs: brianc: yeah
[19:05] norviller has joined the channel
[19:05] brianc: wink_: just did benchmark on my crap 512meg linode: pure javascript 1000 simple queries in 726 milliseconds; libpq bindings 1000 simple queries in 585 milliseconds

[19:06] isaacs: could even do it in a one-liner like that^
[19:06] mjr_: brianc: what's the size of the responses?
[19:06] brianc: isaacs: awesome thanks for the heads up - i will put this in my todo list
[19:06] mjr_: brianc: If you have really large responses, does the native code help a lot more?
[19:06] wink_: surely
[19:06] wink_: although that isn't as large a difference as i would've expected
[19:07] jonaslund: wink_: it's quite logical

[19:08] brianc: mjr_: how large? I'll try to get something figured out
[19:08] EyePulp has joined the channel
[19:08] jonaslund: it all depends on what the query spends time doing
[19:08] jacobolus has joined the channel
[19:08] brianc: also the prepared statement performance on ubuntu with postgres 8.x in pure-javascript is horrific.  I cannot figure out where the bottlekneck is
[19:08] jonaslund: and ofcos js looses on big arrays
[19:09] brianc: on os x w/ brew installed postgres 9.x the performance is again pretty close
[19:09] jonaslund: brianc: prepared statements are sent to the server and returned as a handle to the client right ?
[19:10] Tobsn has joined the channel
[19:10] brianc: but doing a prepared statement ( example: pg.query("select * where name = $1", ['brianc']) ) with pure javascript is broken-slow on ubuntu with postgres 8.x
[19:10] wink_: the server running on ubuntu with pg 8.x?
[19:10] wink_: or node
[19:10] wink_: or both :p
[19:11] brianc: jonaslund: you send the query w/ the placeholders and then you send the values and the server returns results in the same fashion as it would return results for a non-parameterized query
[19:11] brianc: wink_: i run both node and postgres on a few different systems so i can test 
[19:11] jonaslund: brianc: Yes but what i mean is.. can't you re-used the "prepared" part of the prepared statement
[19:11] brianc: wink_: i run node & postgres on ubuntu, debian, and os x. version 8.x and 9.x of postgres. 
[19:11] jonaslund: brianc: since that would save optimizer time on the server,etc
[19:11] brianc: jonaslund: you can
[19:11] unknown_had has joined the channel
[19:12] jonaslund: brianc: Maybe that's the problem with 8.x.. the server doesn't cache prepared statements while 9.x does ?
[19:12] jonaslund: and libpq on 8.x handled caching on the client ?
[19:12] brianc: jonaslund: nah cause the native bindings are crazy fast
[19:12] brianc: jonaslund: oh i see what you're saying
[19:12] brianc: jonaslund: i should ask in #postgres
[19:13] vipaca has joined the channel
[19:13] vipaca has joined the channel
[19:13] brianc: i did 'named' and 'unnamed' prepared statements both, and benchmakred with the pure-javascript actually explicitly skipping the 'parse' step and only calling 'bind' over and over on already parsed query, still 20x as slow
[19:14] brianc: but 99% of the activity was idling while the server returned results, so it still is something in postgres
[19:14] pdelgallego_ has joined the channel
[19:14] brianc: might just be the way i have it configured or a bug in their client api
[19:15] mjr_: brianc: in redis if you get a "one element" response where the element is about 30 bytes, it's roughly the same as native.  If you get 10,000 of those 30 byte elements, native really shines
[19:15] mjr_: I wonder if it'd be the same in pg.

[19:21] mjr_: I found that we lose time in the JS to C++ boundary traversal just for indexing each byte, and then there is some kind of GC overhead that you can avoid on the native side with parsers.
[19:21] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[19:21] mscdex: bigfot: eh?
[19:22] zendfan has joined the channel
[19:22] mjr_: But even though V8 has that nifty way to bind external memory so it acts like an array to JS, reading and writing through it is more expensive than you might expect.

[19:34] V1: tjholowaychuk: hmz, i'll just ignore it for now than :)
[19:34] tjholowaychuk: V1: I think you can alter that per emitter

[19:35] V1: tjholowaychuk: that would just be same as ignoring the output, as it does not affect the test suite I believe 
[19:36] tjholowaychuk: V1: its not a leak though

[19:51] EyePulp: mmm.. I just moved my macbook up to 8gb of ram from 4.  Even if it's not faster I'm telling myself it is.

[19:53] jonaslund: yeah
[19:53] tmedema: jonaslund: I am wondering about the server side, not the client side
[19:54] jonaslund: EyePulp: find some outdated XP machine with 512 mb of memory and try surfing
[19:54] tmedema: eg. what headers need to be set for each chunk
[19:54] jonaslund: paaaaaaaiiiiiiiin
[19:54] jonaslund: tmedema: if you're sending one file (a sound effect,etc) you just send a normal wav or similar file with appropriate mime types
[19:55] EyePulp: heh
[19:55] tmedema: jonaslund: 
[19:55] tmedema: jonaslund: "you just send a normal wav", in chunks of a specified size or does that not matter?
[19:55] wink_: mscdex: oh shit, the reference decoder is...ugh http://www.yenc.org/ydecode-c.txt
[19:55] jonaslund: tmedema: now if you want streaming, just send the headers and start sending the file or source continiously
[19:56] tmedema: jonaslund: what headers should be set?
[19:56] jonaslund: tmedema: send it as fast as the client accepts it
[19:56] A_Nub1 has joined the channel
[19:56] jonaslund: or if you know the bitrate of the file.. send it at that speed
[19:56] jonaslund: tmedema: appropriate mime type perhaps ?
[19:56] EyePulp: anyone have a reccomendation for a decent graphics library for node?  need to handle tiffs, pngs, jpg, for mostly cropping/scaling.  I see there are a number of imagemagick wrappers
[19:57] tmedema: jonaslund: in the content-type header?
[19:57] jonaslund: tmedema: if you point winamp,vlc,etc at an audiofile stored at a server it will happily play it the same it would play a normal file, i don't expect the audio tag stuff to act any differently
[19:57] jonaslund: yes
[19:57] jonaslund: tmedema: seriously
[19:57] jonaslund: tmedema: just try it on your local filesystem
[19:58] tmedema: jonaslund: I have to know what to try
[19:58] jonaslund: place a html file with an audio tag and point it to blah.mp3 in the same folder and place blah there
[19:58] jonaslund: if it works there.. you just need normal file serving
[19:58] tmedema: so I guess I will send one header and then pipe a binary buffer
[19:58] mscdex: wink_: yeah, i just haven't gotten to it yet
[19:58] tmedema: jonaslund: I'm not actually interested in static file serving or streaming
[19:58] tmedema: I need to work with chunks
[19:59] tmedema: as the data will only be there temporarily
[19:59] EyePulp: what's a simple way to encode a basic hash of name/value pairs to a string I can POST in a request.write()
[19:59] wink_: mscdex: if you finish it let me know, i'd love to be able to throw an nzb at something and have it fetch it, i use hellanzb right now, but i'd love for something more programmatic

If it comes down to it I could hack a function in Javascript that'll return a new Buffer to my extension, but there has to be a better way.

[20:10] tjholowaychuk: jmar777: not sure how the new npm handles executables
[20:10] tjholowaychuk: maybe there is a flag you can use to just install stylus(1) globally
[20:10] tjholowaychuk: dunno
[20:10] kkaefer: there's -g for installing it globally

[20:24] jonaslund: tmedema: or actually most browsers should do aggressive caching.. running out of buffers is fatal
[20:24] V1: Hmzz.. I need advice, my memcached-server uses "hashing" to get the correct memcached server for a key. If I don't cache the key > server in memory.. I get 23k ops/sec.. If I do store the key in memory after lookup in memory I get 67k ops/sec . Is this something I should do default?

[20:33] tjholowaychuk: EyePulp: siege can be nice since you can configure it to be more realistic, but plastering a server with tools on the same machine in general is kinda meh
[20:34] kevliu: all data is requested from the node app by hitting those endpoints . using handlebars for client side templating
[20:34] kevliu: i was having problems load testing the app because it's javascript heavy, so i created a test endpoint that makes all ofo the same requests a typical page load would make

[20:57] kevliu: so, are there settings within connect or express that i need to customize in order to handle more concurrent connections, or is everything intended to work perfectly out of the box?
[20:57] sechrist: and you have to go through a broker and crap
[20:57] adulteratedjedi: jdavenport: hi :-)
[20:57] tjholowaychuk: kevliu: I dont think your issue is express
[20:57] kevliu: think it's my testing methodology, then?

[21:47] tjholowaychuk: yeah it's neat
[21:48] brianc: tjholowaychuk: I did get the outbound buffer writer in node-postgres to avoid doing any memcpy for the individual messages which I think helped speed it up
[21:49] brianc: i just append "packets" to a single large buffer and dump that into the socket whenever I need to write, then reset the large buffer's "position" to 0 and start writing at the beginning of it again

[21:49] hij1nx_ has joined the channel

It's somewhat reproducible -- it occurs about 40% of the times I use my optimization framework AssetGraph with a large test case. Here are some of the crashes I've seen: https://gist.github.com/922639
[23:24] papandreou: I've played around with node_g a little, but I need some advice on how to proceed from here.

[23:25] kevliu: is everyone putting node behind nginx or another reverse proxy?
[23:25] perezd: whats the best way to configure an app-wide load path?
[23:26] rektide: i'm looking for suggestions for code/libraries using node-ffi to copy
[23:26] rektide: creationix may have stirred me to action
[23:28] rektide: will infinite idle, please reply at leisure. ;)

[23:29] jesusabdullah: rektide: You're looking for a library to expose to node using node-ffi?
[23:29] jesusabdullah: rektide: I would like a node-gsl, personally.
[23:29] rektide: jesusabdullah: i'm looking for examples of libraries exposed via node-js
[23:29] jesusabdullah: Ah
[23:29] jesusabdullah: Early versions of node-bigint
[23:29] jesusabdullah: I know of that one
[23:29] ckknight|2: kevliu: not necessarily. If you use cluster, it's a full node stack.

[23:30] rektide: why do latter versions of node-bigint not apply?  did node-ffi stop meeting their demands?  why, and how?

[23:33] kevliu: gotcha
[23:33] kevliu: so that might be my problem. didn't know you had to put a reverse proxy in front of node.
[23:34] papandreou: Does anyone have experience hunting down segfaults caused by assertion failures in V8's garbage collector?

[23:39] ckknight_: kevliu: you don't need to, but you do if you want to have more than one instance of node running, since it can't run multiple processes on the same port. You stick a reverse proxy in front (whether it be nginx, lighty, cluster, or otherwise) that listens on port 80 and forwards it to one of your processes.

[23:43] techwraith: ckknight_, kev: or you use something like cluster to handle it for you :)
[23:43] ckknight_: I mentioned cluster.
[23:43] techwraith: Ah, above the fold :)
[23:43] ckknight_: no, in my last statement :P
[23:43] techwraith: damn
[23:44] techwraith: techwraith--
[23:44] v8bot: techwraith: Don't cheat!  You can't give a beer to yourself.
[23:44] ckknight_: cluster does act as a reverse proxy in that it forwards requests to multiple processes, but it also does some extra stuff like spawn workers ad hoc
[23:44] arpegius_ has joined the channel
[23:44] tjholowaychuk: ckknight_: cluster is not a proxy
[23:44] ckknight_: oh
[23:45] ckknight_: how does it do its magic, then?
[23:45] tjholowaychuk: accept()
[23:45] ckknight_: maybe I misread the code last time
[23:45] wilmoore has joined the channel
[23:45] techwraith: ckknight_, tjholowaychuk: Yeah, I thought it was a master process that spawns child processes to do it's bidding
[23:45] tjholowaychuk: techwraith: yeah the master just kinda sits there and regulates things
[23:45] AntelopeSalad has joined the channel
[23:46] techwraith: tjholowaychuk: yeah, I rolled my own before I found cluster, kinda kicking myself for it now, lol
[23:46] tjholowaychuk: hehe
[23:47] tjholowaychuk: oh well it's still good for learning, I dont think I've ever done something and regretted it really
[23:47] aaronblohowiak: Is there any advantage to the first one of these two approaches for cloning a prototype-chain leaf ? https://gist.github.com/cf07ea6d67a93f567662
[23:47] tjholowaychuk: in fact I think it's great practice to grab something like redis and start re-implementing it
[23:47] tjholowaychuk: to learn
[23:47] techwraith: That's true, I understand how things talk to eachother a lot more now :)

[23:49] aaronblohowiak: opaque: which way does your output buffer go?
[23:49] aaronblohowiak: it looks like your console is backwards!
[23:49] aaronblohowiak: ;)
[23:50] opaque: aaronblohowiak: Sorry, that's after refreshing the page twice. The first "load", a normal 1:1 connection is made. On the second, n+1 etc..
[23:51] aaronblohowiak: opaque: s/socket/client
[23:51] opaque: The log shows one websocket connection is made, but the logger seems to be hit a couple more times.
[23:51] aaronblohowiak: opaque: on every .get, you are registering the handler on the socket object
[23:51] techwraith: opaque: Try putting your socket.on('connection') outside your route.
[23:52] opaque: Hm. Good point. I was trying to get the req and res the easy way :|

[23:57] techwraith: You could send it down to the client and send it back up the socket, but that sounds like it might have some security implications
