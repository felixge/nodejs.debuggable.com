[00:56] lukegalea: kylefox: I think I know what's up
[00:56] kylefox: lukegalea: yeah?
[00:57] kylefox: I just modified the backbone source to require('./underscore) instead of require('underscore');
[00:57] kylefox: and it worked
[00:57] lukegalea: isaacs helped me out with a similar problem. When you are vendoring a module, you have to use the *full* path and add it to the require paths
[00:57] kylefox: but I obviously would prefer to not be modifying backbone
[00:57] lukegalea: when you removed the ./ it is using the "system" module instead of your vendored version.
[00:57] isaacs: kylefox: use "node_modules", not "./vendor"
[00:57] isaacs: kylefox: you'll be glad later.
[00:57] isaacs: trust me
[00:57] lukegalea: You need to add: require.paths.unshift(path.join(__dirname, "../vendor"));
[00:58] ecto: nobody?
[00:58] isaacs: if you rename "vendor" to "node_modules", then you won't need to monkey with require paths in 0.5.x
[00:58] lukegalea: isaacs: I'm using both :( node_modules for stuff installed via bundle install, and vendor for my git submodule dependencies.
[00:58] isaacs: interesting
[00:58] isaacs: you can't just have them live in the same folder?
[00:59] isaacs: lukegalea: ^
[00:59] felixge has joined the channel
[00:59] kylefox: hmm, interesting, it will automatically load stuff in  the 'node_modules' folder?
[00:59] isaacs: kylefox: not yet.
[00:59] kylefox: ok
[00:59] isaacs: kylefox: well, it will, today, if you npm install your module.
[00:59] lukegalea: that's a good question.. I didn't even try. I was worried about what npm might do to rogue directories I've shoved in there.
[00:59] isaacs: npm will set that up for it
[00:59] isaacs: lukegalea: npm assumes that you meant to put that there, and doesn't touch it
[01:00] isaacs: lukegalea: if you `npm install` somthing with that same name, though, it'll trample it
[01:00] lukegalea: aah. that will simplify things for me .. thanks. 
[01:00] isaacs: lukegalea: the filesystem is 100% of npm's knowledge about the file system
[01:00] matbee has joined the channel
[01:00] lukegalea: kylefox: The other prob with your code snippet is you need to assign underscore to something AFAIK. ie. var _ = require('underscore')
[01:00] lukegalea: I don't think underscore tramples the global namespace in any way.

[01:03] lukegalea: As an aside, damn I'm looking forward to Nodeconf. That was touch and go there trying to get a ticket in time. 
[01:03] lukegalea: How many tickets were sold in the end?
[01:03] curtischambers has joined the channel
[01:03] broofa has joined the channel
[01:05] kylefox: sweet, it works!
[01:05] kylefox: had to do this though: require.paths.unshift(path.join(__dirname, "./vendor"));
[01:05] kylefox: ../vendor was going up one too many directories, heh
[01:05] kylefox: and fyi, backbone attempts to require('underscore') if this._ isn't present
[01:05] lukegalea: kylefox: oh, sorry, I pasted from one of my tests
[01:06] lukegalea: you can just remove the ./ entirely
[01:06] kylefox: so all I need to do now is var Backbone = require('backbone')
[01:06] kylefox: which is awesome
[01:06] isaacs: kylefox, lukegalea: why not just `npm bundle install backbone` and then do require("../node_modules/backbone")?
[01:07] kylefox: isaacs: heh
[01:07] kylefox: because i've never seen that before ... :)
[01:07] isaacs: heh
[01:07] isaacs: is underscore listed as oneof backbone's deps?
[01:07] kylefox: `bundle` just installs it into your current directory or something?
[01:07] kylefox: isaacs: yep, it is
[01:07] isaacs: npm bundle <dosomething> does the <dosomething> command in ./node_modules, yes
[01:07] lukegalea: In my case I have a whole lot of bundled modules.. so I don't want to go through all my code and add the node modules ref. I'd rather just do it once.
[01:08] isaacs: lukegalea: suresure.
[01:08] lukegalea: but ya, kylefox has only one.
[01:08] matti: konobi: Maybe you know some library which I could use to send / server bigger static files?
[01:08] isaacs: and, like i said, eventually "node_modules" will be in the require lookup path automatically anyway

[03:05] NemesisD: hi all. is there an effective way to create constructor-based objects that make async system calls? should they just be altogether avoided or is there a trick to only continuing after the constructor is done?
[03:06] SubStack: NemesisD: async calls for object setup?
[03:07] fairwinds has joined the channel
[03:07] SubStack: NemesisD: you can turn the object into an EventEmitter and emit a 'ready' event or some such
[03:07] Aria: Or call a callback with the object.
[03:07] SubStack: or else expose the special async properties in an event or through a callback
[03:07] NemesisD: ive got a setup constructor that reads from a config file, ideally it should hang the app until its done, but something feels weird about config = new config(function() { now its done });
[03:07] Aria: foo.createObject(function(obj) { .... })
[03:08] SubStack: perhaps have a .load()
[03:08] Aria: Hehe. That's async for you.
[03:08] SubStack: really depends on what makes sense for your object
[03:08] NemesisD: it hurts
[03:08] langworthy has joined the channel
[03:08] kris_ has joined the channel
[03:08] SubStack: NemesisD: I would do the io outside of the constructor altogether
[03:08] aaron_afk: NemesisD: you probably shouldnt be reading from a file in your constructor
[03:09] aaron_afk: SubStack++
[03:09] v8bot:  aaron_afk has given a beer to SubStack. SubStack now has 5 beers.
[03:09] SubStack: a thin io shell haskell-style
[03:10] SubStack: for one it makes testing easier to separate io from your functions as much as makes sense
[03:13] aaron_afk: for two, it makes it easier to control configurations algorithmically
[03:13] NemesisD: i guess. in my context, the object i'm creating is literally unusable until it performs that IO action, so that would mean everone who uses it would have to remember do the IO action after the constructor finished
[03:14] aaron_afk: for three, it is easier to debug / monitor
[03:14] aaron_afk: NemesisD: no, make the config a param to the ctor, leave loading configurations up to your consumer
[03:14] CarterA: You could have the constructor take a buffer instead of performing any IO.
[03:15] NemesisD: oh i see
[03:15] CarterA: The user then does the IO themselves and gives you the result.
[03:15] aaron_afk: a = new MegaService(config); // config was config = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('myOwnDamnConfigFile.json'))
[03:15] aaron_afk: CarterA: not a buffer, but a js object =)
[03:15] CarterA: Ah.
[03:16] NemesisD: well in this case its just a dataset, i still want the constructor to do all the setup stuff but i guess it makes sense to actually get the dataset and hand it into the ctor when ready
[03:16] NemesisD: i like that better than a constructor with a callback
[03:16] JimBastard has joined the channel
[03:16] Aria: Javascript constructors are weird. Both node and the DOM have a common idiom of having another function actually set things up.
[03:18] Aria: And I think it's often the right thing -- have that function load the data, then pass it to the constructor, then callback with the object.
[03:18] Aria: (or return it if it was a synchronous thing.)

[05:35] echosystm: devrim: v8 compiling javascript is part of JIT
[05:35] echosystm: it's not a once-off thing
[05:38] devrim: so what do pro-nodejs people do when they want to deploy to 100s of servers the same app .. ?
[05:38] echosystm: they prepare a package for the server and install it on all of them
[05:38] echosystm: same as you would any other managed language software
[05:38] echosystm: or... just any software in general
[05:39] devrim: we are porting from c++ and go, and a newbie at node, so should i compare nodejs deployment to php ?
[05:40] echosystm: i dont think you will ever get rid of the VM, so i guess so
[05:40] micheil: devrim: I'm actually working on a tool at the moment which will package up your app into a tarball (deps included) and then upload that to your server & then deploy it
[05:40] devrim: micheil, that's great news
[05:40] devrim: is there any way i can get a peek ?
[05:40] micheil: at the moment, the most common way is to just use git-deploys, but that only really works with one server
[05:40] micheil: devrim: no.
[05:40] echosystm: that will be effectively the same as packaging though micheil 
[05:41] micheil: echosystm: yup. it uses npm under the hood.
[05:41] mikeal has joined the channel
[05:41] micheil: but also allows for dependencies that aren't on the public registry (via git urls)
[05:42] devrim: so the way it works is then, you basically make a bash filie that clones repos, runs bash commands, installs npm and runs your program, and its code will be out in the open
[05:42] micheil: uhh.. not quite
[05:42] micheil: your server should be setup with node and npm from the get go.
[05:42] echosystm: i would prefer to just prepare packages for the package manager of the server
[05:43] echosystm: well, i wouldnt personally
[05:43] devrim: im still unclear - is there any example of packaging that you talk about ?
[05:43] micheil: uhh.. sort of.
[05:43] echosystm: but i know the system admins at my work would prefer it
[05:43] micheil: npm is in a way it.
[05:43] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[05:44] micheil: but doesn't solve the problem totally.
[05:44] micheil: npm is the defacto node package manager
[05:44] micheil: (like ruby gems or pip)
[05:44] echosystm: it depends a lot on who is looking after the server, i think
[05:44] echosystm: systems guys aren't going to want to touch NPM etc.
[05:44] micheil: as for your servers, I'd assume that if you're massively allocating them, then you would have a custom iso of your server config.
[05:45] masahiroh has joined the channel
[05:45] micheil: echosystm: exactly. but if they can run a simple daemon on their server, have it password protected & over tls, then they'd do that.
[05:46] micheil: besides, not that any of us are really sysadmins.. >_>
[05:46] echosystm: no i mean, they wouldnt want to have to explicitly build + install node/npm in the first place
[05:46] devrim: that's the whole point
[05:46] micheil: well, how else do you get the software on the computer?
[05:47] devrim: we want /etc/init.d/mynodeapp start
[05:47] micheil: you have to build and install Go on your server
[05:47] echosystm: at the company i work for, it is expected that any software we want on a server will be packaged using the package manager of the target server
[05:47] micheil: devrim: I currently have something like that.
[05:47] micheil: although, I'm using upstart, not init.d
[05:47] devrim: no you dont micheil, once you have the binary, no other computer needs go compiling or c++ compiling
[05:47] echosystm: all the dependencies + dependency handling would thus be done by that package manager
[05:48] echosystm: but, like i said, it all comes back to who is managing the server
[05:48] matbee has joined the channel
[05:48] micheil: oh well, I'd just say: I expect servers to be setup properly prior to deploying code, because deploying binary stuff is kinda shit.
[05:48] micheil: besides, JS isn't something that's binary
[05:49] devrim: micheil, im not sure you know what you're talking about everything you install with yum or apt-get are binaries
[05:49] devrim: and thats what sysadmins know and manage
[05:50] micheil: great, like I said, I'm not a sysadmin. At the moment, node is installed from source, because that's the best way to install it.
[05:50] micheil: it takes like five or ten minutes to do.
[05:50] echosystm: the difference is that micheils approach is good for programmers
[05:50] micheil: if you use archlinux or similar, then you can actually package it up.
[05:50] echosystm: the other is good for admins, who dont want/need to care about the code
[05:50] micheil: the tool I'm working on assumes that the server is setup.
[05:51] micheil: it's about deploying code, not deploying servers
[05:51] echosystm: (and dont want to know a different packaging system)
[05:51] echosystm: so, like i was saying, it's a matter of who is managing the server
[05:51] micheil: I'm wanting a better way, as a developer, to deploy my code to my servers
[05:51] devrim: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3579044/is-it-possible-to-compile-a-js-app-the-nodejs-interpreter-into-a-single-executa
[05:52] echosystm: yes, and your solution meets that
[05:52] liar has joined the channel
[05:52] micheil: that means that I've got everything already setup.
[05:53] micheil: basically node isn't exactly designed to be compiled into a binary file.
[05:53] micheil: it's like the difference between core and userland.
[05:53] echosystm: micheil: i dont know if we have our wires crossed or not
[05:54] devrim: i guess not for now - but i'm sure it will be. 
[05:54] micheil: devrim: probably won't be.
[05:54] echosystm: devrim: it never will be
[05:54] echosystm: v8 compiling javascript to machine code is for optimisation purposes only
[05:54] micheil: https://github.com/ry/node/wiki/node-core-vs-userland
[05:54] micheil: and the only time you save is in app startup time, not running time.
[05:55] echosystm: javascript is a dynamic language - it is expected things are going to change and get recompiled etc.
[05:55] echosystm: your issue is not whether you can compile to a binary though
[05:55] devrim: guys - when compiled js doesn't become another language - its the same set of assembly lines sent to the processor, anyway thx for your input, i guess i shouldn't force this conversatoin
[05:56] echosystm: your issue is how do you get your code on multiple servers
[05:56] micheil: which is the issue I'm solving. I'm not solving how to get your servers setup. There's other tools for that.
[05:56] devrim: "node core vs userland" has nothing to do with this subject
[05:57] devrim: it's a dicussion of what needs to be included on node and what stays out
[05:57] micheil: I would think that anyone who is deploying node at scale has some way of installing the operating system with node pre-installed.
[05:57] Twelve-60: arrgggh, trying to use the memcache addon but I get: Error: libmemcached.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory :(

[05:59] bingomanatee: Hey I got a fun little mini-work queue for holding a callback til stuff gets done. https://github.com/bignomanatee/workstack
[05:59] bingomanatee: enjoy. 
[05:59] micheil: bingomanatee: hmm, sounds like something interesting
[05:59] vipaca has joined the channel
[06:00] echosystm: devrim: do you understand that node.js uses JIT?
[06:00] vipaca: How do you decode buffers back to plain text?
[06:00] echosystm: you can't just take your whole javascript and compile it down to machine code once
[06:00] devrim: so?
[06:00] micheil: devrim: for instance, if you're deploying node to EC2 instances, I'd expect you to have a custom AMI
[06:00] echosystm: its not a one-off thing
[06:00] devrim: am i changing my code while its running?
[06:00] micheil: vipaca: try the Buffer.* methods
[06:00] bingomanatee: Yeah I had problems with having a series of mongo inserts and didn't want to wait til each indiviaul insert was done so I wrote this thing to block the callback til the colleciton was updated. 
[06:01] kiddphunk has joined the channel
[06:01] devrim: no - so it can change once, save that state and give it to me.
[06:01] micheil: vipaca: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.3.6/api/buffers.html#buffer.toString
[06:01] devrim: hey bingomanatee!
[06:01] devrim: that's a nice app you created!
[06:01] bingomanatee: Thanks.
[06:03] micheil: bingomanatee: hmm, is that for worker queues, or callback management?
[06:03] bingomanatee: Its for a very specific scenario. 
[06:03] echosystm: devrim: do you understand what JIT is?
[06:03] echosystm: it's all based around runtime profiling
[06:03] echosystm: you cant statically compile code that will only perform well when runtime profiling is to be done
[06:04] bingomanatee: Where you are asynchronously sending off a bunch of work tasks and want to wait to respond until the last work is done and the last callback is called. 
[06:04] devrim: echosystm: you make 1.js and when you say node 1.js what do you think is happening ?
[06:04] vipaca: micheil: oh wierd when I called console.log on the bugger I expected an implicit toString()
[06:04] echosystm: it starts profiling the code and compiling certain parts of it
[06:04] micheil: nup.
[06:05] echosystm: it doesnt compile the whole thing down to machine code that will never change
[06:05] micheil: vipaca: certain objects in node have custom console.log methods
[06:05] devrim: it does.
[06:05] micheil: vipaca: for instance, buffers usually print something like <Buffer hex data here>
[06:05] vipaca: micheil: yeah I just got the raw buffer dump
[06:06] vipaca: a little confusing, but the toString actually decoded correctly for me thx
[06:06] micheil: vipaca: just be careful with that documentation of buffer.toString, as it says the wrong thing with the arguments
[06:06] bingomanatee: Most work queues exist to ensure that tasks are solved in order. 
[06:06] micheil: it should be buffer.toString(encoding, start, end)
[06:06] echosystm: the whole point of JIT is that the code is optimised at runtime, that is completely incompatible with static compiling
[06:06] bingomanatee: workstack is designed for the opposite scenario, where all you care about is that an aggreate series of functions are completed before a response callback is fire.d 
[06:07] micheil: bingomanatee: hmm, where as this does it such that it just wants to know when all takes are done
[06:07] bingomanatee: Yep. 
[06:07] micheil: okay, well, work_stack looks overly complicated for that
[06:07] bingomanatee: Its a simple increment/decrement syste. 
[06:07] bingomanatee: m. 
[06:07] devrim: echosystm: http://d.pr/ujTg look at the third line, i can actually put my code at the end of node js and compile it, and your JIT would have no problems with it. So this will be done in a better way in the future.
[06:08] devrim: when i say node, it will run with as my app.
[06:08] micheil: ryah: would you care to weigh in on that?
[06:08] devrim: (btw im not sure if that works - just to illustrate my point)
[06:09] micheil: devrim: basically, while yes, the core modules are compiled into node, that's only because they are core; hence the link to the core vs userland
[06:09] echosystm: what am i looking at here?
[06:10] echosystm: this is installing nodejs
[06:10] bingomanatee: There are hooks for echoing things out as you go that aren't critical to the functioning of the stack. 
[06:10] devrim: yes on third line
[06:10] echosystm: arent you talking about compiling your javascript to machine code?
[06:10] micheil: echosystm: yeah, but they are putting their own code inside src/node.js
[06:10] devrim: you add your own code into compiling of nodejs
[06:10] micheil: iirc, the core modules are staticly compiled; in a way.
[06:10] liar has joined the channel
[06:10] admc has joined the channel
[06:11] micheil: devrim: but that's not how node is designed, and it probably won't ever endorse something like that.
[06:11] vipaca: micheil for giggle I just used sys.puts withouth the explicit call to toString for buffer and also got the decode
[06:11] vipaca: so what the difference btw sys.puts and console.log?
[06:11] micheil: devrim: what you're doing there is modifing the core.
[06:11] echosystm: thats a different circumstance devrim
[06:12] devrim: its the same circumstance

[06:12] micheil: devrim: basically, you shouldn't be doing that.

[06:13] Yuffster has joined the channel
[06:14] micheil: if you want something that compiles to a single binary file, I'd suggest you look maybe else where.
[06:14] devrim: thanks micheil.

[06:16] echosystm: if this JS is being compiled into machine code and never changed, then you can only assume its not getting all the profiling magic of JIT
[06:16] echosystm: is that what you want?
[06:16] breccan_ has joined the channel
[06:19] vipaca: so what the difference btw sys.puts and console.log?
[06:20] devrim: alright: everything is 0s and 1s - if we agree on that, there is no point of this discussion, your JIT is 0s and 1s too. thus everything can be compiled and packaged. whether it is possible or not, that's a choice, whether it will be made possible or not that's another choice. but compiling doesn't add or take away from what it is. everything that runs on a processor is binary. period.
[06:21] SubStack: vipaca: console.log is built-in and sys is deprecated
[06:22] vipaca: k, thx, I guess there isn't any documentation on the console module itself?
[06:22] SubStack: devrim: the problem is that it's really hard. If you figure it out and make it easy more power to you
[06:25] micheil: SubStack: sys isn't quite deprecated.
[06:25] devrim: thx substack - that's a valid comment, are there people who are trying that u know of? 
[06:25] micheil: just renamed.
[06:26] micheil: devrim: things that node won't do is modify the v8 engine; I'm guessing for you to be able to statically compile javascript to machine code, then you'd need to mod v8

[08:40] jesusabdullah: Not yet, but I've considered it

[08:42] skm has joined the channel
[08:42] mscdex: tmpvar: who me?
[08:42] tmpvar: yeah :)
[08:42] micheil: mscdex: in the node modules that votizen are release, for now we're using jsdoc format, but we don't actually have a tool to convert that to html
[08:43] mscdex: yeah it'd be nice to have a setup that can have different output formats
[08:43] mscdex: especially html and markdown
[08:43] micheil: I'm currently reworking the node doctool
[08:44] micheil: essentially to have a more human based input; be inspired by markdown, but not be markdown
[08:44] mscdex: tmpvar: hmm.. never used jade
[08:44] tmpvar: mscdex, sorry man, my mind is mush
[08:44] mscdex: i just hate generating huge docs heh
[08:44] tmpvar: i thought you wanted a use case
[08:44] mscdex: after i've coded a ton of stuff
[08:44] tmpvar: word
[08:45] mscdex: sometimes i just feel like writing "RTFC" in a readme.md and pushing it

[08:45] tmpvar: nice one
[08:45] tmpvar: the f-u docu format
[08:46] tmpvar: mscdex, what have you been working on these days?
[08:47] mscdex: well, after spending the holidays working on ncurses, it's been node-oscar the past week or so
[08:47] mscdex: got chat working, but still need to do direct connection and file transfer support
[08:47] mscdex: and ICQ testing yet
[08:47] mscdex: heh
[08:47] nooder has left the channel
[08:48] tmpvar: oh wow, nice

[08:48] tmpvar: oh god
[08:48] mscdex: :)
[08:48] tmpvar: i did TOC in C a while back (years)
[08:48] mscdex: libpurple has a lot of cruft that caters to ancient clients
[08:48] tmpvar: that was horrible.. how has it been progressing?
[08:49] tmpvar: pain at every step or are there sane docs these days?
[08:49] hwinkel has joined the channel
[08:49] mscdex: TOC is a lot easier than OSCAR, but you don't get the flexibility
[08:49] mscdex: things have been going fairly well
[08:50] tmpvar: thats good :)
[08:50] Ond has joined the channel
[08:50] tmpvar: yeah, I'm familiar with the difference
[08:50] mscdex: docs aren't as plentiful as i'd like them to be, but i rely on referencing other open source clients and what little is in the short-lived OSCAR referenced made available by AOL a few years back
[08:50] tmpvar: ah, nice
[08:51] tmpvar: man, i wish i still had that code.. it was pretty hackish
[08:51] mscdex: hehe
[08:51] tmpvar: and i was avoiding oscar, because it was way out of my league
[08:51] tmpvar: no docs, only partially reversed, etc
[08:52] tmpvar: i remember using this crazy text doc that i found somewhere to implement the first part of TOC.. oh yeah.. story time.. lol
[08:52] mscdex: yeah, it took awhile for me to get into it... understanding the packet formats, how the comm flows, etc
[08:52] tmpvar: well, thats awesome
[08:53] mscdex: there's still a lot of stuff out there that's undocumented though :(
[08:53] chapel: keep up the good work mscdex
[08:53] tmpvar: now all we need is a xmpp client and we can ditch pidgin/adium :)
[08:53] chapel: what is your plans for it?
[08:53] tmpvar: mscdex, i dont doubt it.. purple sources are hell as well

[08:54] mscdex: chapel: no particular plans. it's just a protocol i picked up one day because i was looking for something else to work on :)
[08:54] chapel: ah
[08:54] tmpvar: mscdex, thats commendable, someone has to do it hehe
[08:54] mscdex: tmpvar: yeah, i particularly enjoyed some of their code comments :)
[08:55] tmpvar: so its all in js, thats pretty awesome
[08:56] mscdex: yep
[08:56] ROBOd has joined the channel
[08:56] tmpvar: is there a point at which you can say that you are  "done" ?
[08:56] tmpvar: i dont imagine the protocol evolves much these days, except to provide more ad avenues for aol
[08:57] mscdex: more or less... i mean there is undocumented stuff going on with the protocol
[08:57] mscdex: you can tell because the server sends you stuff that isn't written about anywhere else
[08:57] mscdex: occasionally
[08:57] tmpvar: interesting
[08:57] mscdex: probably for the newest clients
[08:57] mscdex: fluff features like animated smileys or some junk like that i bet
[08:58] tmpvar: yep
[08:58] mscdex: but others may actually useful though, who knows
[08:58] dekz has joined the channel
[08:58] tmpvar: haha, doubtful
[08:58] mscdex: i'm hopeful :)
[08:59] tmpvar: l33t sploits have been handled years ago lol
[08:59] tmpvar: TOC seems more stable imo
[08:59] mscdex: well, some of the unknown packets you can look at it and pretty much guess the format, but you have no idea what the content means
[08:59] tmpvar: as far as being able to implement something that is relatively future proof
[09:00] tmpvar: true
[09:00] mscdex: they have a developer api which is now closed now that makes things even easier than TOC i think
[09:00] mscdex: but you're limited
[09:01] tmpvar: yeah for sure
[09:01] tmpvar: oscar is great, if you can keep up with em
[09:02] tmpvar: so im curious what would be needed to replace these shitty desktop aim clients with a node backend
[09:02] Wizek has joined the channel
[09:02] mscdex: i'm actually content without file transfer and direct connection support, but maybe someone wants one or both of those features, i don't know

[09:05] mscdex: lol  yes

[09:09] tmpvar: ok, so why couldn't you go?
[09:10] tmpvar: lol
[09:10] mscdex: well if there's a jsconf or nodeconf closer to me, i'd be willing to go
[09:11] mscdex: or even some other node meetup
[09:11] tmpvar: i feel ya
[09:11] chapel: Im pretty close
[09:11] mscdex: there's 1 javascript meetup group where i live, but they always have boring stuff on the agenda

[09:20] mscdex: another IDE
[09:20] tmpvar: more java!

[09:29] opus_: hey guys
[09:29] opus_: is it possible to build node.js as a library? 
[09:30] SubStack: opus_: that sounds hard
[09:30] ryah: i'm trying to get the width and height of a single character monospace font
[09:30] ryah: so i made a little <font id='calibration'>&nbsp;</font> thing
[09:30] garrensmith: is nodejs the only server with the header Transfer-Encoding: chunked
[09:30] jimt has joined the channel
[09:30] ryah: but offsetWidth and offsetHeight don't appear to be very accurate
[09:31] tmpvar: ryah, how so?
[09:31] SubStack: maybe <div style="width: 1em"></div>
[09:32] opus_: SubStack: yeah, I want to see if I can leverage the power of Node.JS into an app
[09:32] tmpvar: ryah, you can measure a font width with a canvas pretty easily
[09:32] tmpvar: if you want to go that route
[09:33] mscdex: opus_: i believe you can configure it do compile as a library
[09:34] garrensmith: opus_: what type of library?
[09:34] opus_: a library I can link to with another program running its own main()
[09:35] mscdex: opus_: https://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/wscript#L170
[09:35] SubStack: ryah: try this $('<span>').css({ 'font-size' : 'monospace' }).text('x').appendTo($(document.body)).width()
[09:35] tmpvar: garrensmith, no. set a Content-length and it wont chunk
[09:35] SubStack: seems plausible, gives "8" for me
[09:35] garrensmith: tmpvar: when is it good to send chunks? When streaming is required?
[09:36] SubStack: oh hah
[09:36] SubStack: font-size >_<
[09:36] tmpvar: garrensmith, for multi-part responses
[09:36] SubStack: $('<span>').css({ 'font-family' : 'monospace' }).text('x').appendTo($(document.body)).width()
[09:36] SubStack: 9
[09:36] garrensmith: tmpvar: cool thanks
[09:37] SubStack: or .html('&nbsp;') gives the same value
[09:38] opus_: has anyone had any success cross compiling Node JS for ARM? I'm getting an error
[09:38] tmpvar: opus_, i'd check the mailing list
[09:39] tmpvar: i vaguely recall yes, but i cant be certain
[09:39] opus_: http://pastebin.com/YBCxjt8L
[09:39] ryah: SubStack: can i do that without jquery?
[09:39] opus_: tmpvar: thanks
[09:39] SubStack: ryah: sure, but it's more typing
[09:39] opus_: the error is in V8 so I guess its a google error
[09:39] ryah: in particular what does .width() do?
[09:39] opus_: but I know V8 compiles for ARM because of Android
[09:41] SubStack: also palm uses arm and also node

[09:44] SubStack: why no jquery?
[09:44] tmpvar: lol
[09:45] ryah: canvas? i'd rather not just to get the width of the font...
[09:45] tmpvar: the dom/browser is a scary place.. jquery or canvas is your best (friendliest) bet
[09:46] SubStack: also you can just <script src="..."> these: http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery#CDN_Hosted_jQuery

[09:47] tmpvar: etc.
[09:48] ryah: i jsut mean being able to think about it...
[09:48] SubStack: thinking about it is pretty easy
[09:48] SubStack: it just works™
[09:48] ryah: meh
[09:48] SubStack: and it saves you from the pain of the dom
[09:49] SubStack: I write code like the height/width thing all the time
[09:49] tmpvar: ryah, to be honest, im sorry I linked you there. it appears that that is inner[Height|Width]
[09:50] micheil: ryah: from the nodecamp website, is the node.js logo there about somewhere?
[09:50] SubStack: I love not having to care about how node works for the most part too
[09:50] SubStack: encapsulation of concerns yay
[09:51] tmpvar: SubStack, I would have to admit though, node is much cleaner
[09:51] SubStack: disagree
[09:51] tmpvar: not even an attempt to kiss ass.
[09:51] SubStack: on account of how it's c++
[09:51] kjeldahl has joined the channel
[09:51] SubStack: c++ is by definition messier and harder to follow
[09:51] tmpvar: lol
[09:51] micheil: ryah: I agree that jquery's programming style is annoying..
[09:51] tmpvar: i come from c, so i guess its the same
[09:51] tmpvar: so jquery is all about the external api
[09:52] micheil: ACTION comes from javascript >_>
[09:52] tmpvar: internals are hosed
[09:52] SubStack: of course I started programming javascript when I was 11 so that probably affects my perceptions a tad
[09:52] tmpvar: heh
[09:52] micheil: SubStack: myscripts.com?
[09:52] micheil: ;D
[09:52] micheil: or what ever it was.
[09:52] tmpvar: SubStack, you should know all the browser tricks
[09:52] guybrush: tmpvar: i did some improvements https://gist.github.com/802552 , still i dont like the jsdom/jquery-scrapping way - will try to do my own smart "selector-lib"
[09:53] SubStack: tmpvar: I hate myself for knowing some of them
[09:53] tmpvar: guybrush, oh nice, hi!
[09:53] SubStack: like remember <layer> tags?
[09:53] SubStack: I do.
[09:53] tmpvar: lol
[09:53] tmpvar: guybrush, nice, 700ms.. thats still GOD AWEFUL
[09:53] SubStack: I'm still somewhat upset that they lost out to <div>
[09:53] tmpvar: AWFUL even
[09:54] micheil: SubStack: yeah, I remember the layer tag. I was in about I think year 3 or 4 of primary school at that stage..
[09:54] guybrush: i guess it can be faster with lvl1 and sizzle? (still dont fully understand this lvl thing)
[09:54] micheil: so, probably about 8-10 years old.
[09:55] Lorentz: It all started with BASIC for me.
[09:55] micheil: guybrush: it's the W3C dom level specs
[09:55] Lorentz: gwbasic, to be exact.
[09:55] SubStack: in 8th grade I didn't have powerpoint at home so I wrote javascript-powered presentations instead
[09:55] tmpvar: guybrush, so the dom was developed over a long period of time
[09:55] guybrush: have to read into that i guess, damn i am so lazy :/
[09:56] SubStack: and now I use latex with beamer
[09:56] tmpvar: guybrush, basically each new effort they (w3) made towards the document object model was a new level
[09:56] micheil: SubStack: I can remember my IT teacher from about 2-3 years ago teaching the class that you build websites in powerpoint.
[09:56] tmpvar: guybrush, you can turn stuff off to make it faster
[09:56] guybrush: tmpvar: haha that sounds clever :)
[09:56] tmpvar: guybrush, but you risk breaking stuff
[09:56] micheil: I had to correct him there and managed to get him into teaching the students how to use dreamweaver
[09:57] tmpvar: wow
[09:57] tim_smart: The should be using a text editor >.>
[09:57] tim_smart: They*
[09:57] tmpvar: timmy :)
[09:58] micheil: tim_smart: hey, at least I managed to teach them some of the concepts of CSS and stuff
[09:58] tim_smart: We made our websites in notepad at high school
[09:58] tmpvar: guybrush, disabling mutation events is ok if you are just scraping
[09:58] torvalamo has joined the channel
[09:58] guybrush: tmpvar: i see, thx for the hint
[09:58] micheil: tim_smart: this IT class was.. erm.. mainly made up of lower-level achievers.
[09:59] micheil: it wasn't mainly geeks
[09:59] tmpvar: guybrush, we should probably get that into zombie
[09:59] tmpvar: although.. they may want to scrape ajax content and such
[09:59] tmpvar: these are minor optimizations though.. I really need to go through and fix a bunch of stuff

[10:09] tmpvar: yes

[10:10] dekz: hmms
[10:10] dekz: and content-length is mandatory?
[10:10] tmpvar: no

[10:44] mscdex: :p
[10:45] micheil: I walked pretty much everywhere or caught the trains
[10:45] tmpvar: mape, will you be my +1?
[10:45] micheil: mape: maybe nodeconf or a meetup?

[10:49] tmpvar: :)

[10:52] mape: On jsdom?
[10:52] tmpvar: we'll see if people care about jsdom then!
[10:52] tmpvar: haha
[10:52] tmpvar: dude, what else do i have
[10:52] tmpvar: node-ogl?
[10:52] tmpvar: pft
[10:52] mape: hehe
[10:52] tmpvar: :)
[10:52] mscdex: node-ogle
[10:53] tmpvar: yeah, jsdom, im almost done with that bitch.
[10:53] mscdex: yay!
[10:53] tmpvar: maybe i can do something useful in the future
[10:53] tanepiper: is anyone using a builtbot or CI too with coffeescript?
[10:53] tanepiper: *tool

[10:55] tmpvar: haha, sorry, i just wanted a view into what you were doing ;)
[10:55] tmpvar:  /truthtime
[10:56] tanepiper: oh, i'm trying coffeescript out and wondered if there were any buildbots that work with it, maybe with jake

[11:06] sechrist: Looking over Douglas Crockford's javascript sheet it says 4, but I've been using 2 since I started writing node code
[11:06] sechrist: so many closures get crazy when you tab
[11:06] stagas: SubStack: only with hkeys, hgetall(key, function(err, data) {})
[11:06] mscdex: i use 2 space tabs
[11:06] Coal has joined the channel
[11:06] SubStack: I like 4 spaces
[11:07] stagas: SubStack: re: get data from chaos :)
[11:07] SubStack: stagas: what is the difference between an hkey and a regular key?
[11:07] SubStack: are they like order-2 depth?
[11:07] SubStack: ring 1 key and ring 2, I mean to say?
[11:07] sechrist: What datastore are you guys talking about?
[11:07] SubStack: sechrist: chaos
[11:07] stagas: SubStack: yes, in reality hkeys are dirs, and fields are files, utf8
[11:08] SubStack: ah
[11:08] SubStack: stagas: you should put that in the readme
[11:08] sechrist: SubStack: you use 4 spaces even with function(){function(){function(){function(){}}}}?
[11:08] guybrush: v8: Math.pow(2,53) < Math.pow(2,53)+1
[11:08] v8bot: guybrush: false
[11:08] SubStack: sechrist: and 80 columns
[11:09] sechrist: how the hell
[11:09] guybrush: creationix has the best tweets :)
[11:09] SubStack: because I'm awesome is how
[11:09] sechrist: SubStack: do you use vim?
[11:09] SubStack: yes
[11:09] sechrist: are you using any special indent plugins?
[11:09] SubStack: no
[11:10] tmpvar: sechrist, where do you hail from?
[11:11] sechrist: Like, editor?
[11:11] stagas: SubStack: a wrapper could easily be built for compatibility with nstore/supermarket etc. I thought about it for the session thing you have
[11:11] sechrist: tmpvar: I'm from Texas but I live in The Valley now
[11:11] tmpvar: ah
[11:11] skm has joined the channel
[11:11] tmpvar: cool
[11:12] SubStack: sechrist: I write code by ruthlessly spinning off modules
[11:12] SubStack: that's how I keep the indent level down
[11:14] sechrist: hum
[11:14] SubStack: that and I write a lot of chainable interfaces
[11:14] SubStack: also a good tactic for keeping the indents manageable
[11:14] sechrist: and for browser code?
[11:15] SubStack: jquery everywhere
[11:15] unomi has joined the channel
[11:15] SubStack: 4 spaces 80 columns same as everywhere
[11:16] SubStack: but then 2 spaces for jade because tjholowaychuk is bossy like that
[11:17] mape: tmpvar: Almost finished as in?
[11:18] SubStack: sechrist: write enough idiomatic haskell and you will get very good at flattening nested logic with pipeline style interfaces
[11:19] tmpvar: mape: hrm?
[11:19] mape: tmpvar: jsdom? Almost finished? Seems like that is a project that could go on for a while
[11:19] mape: Making things faster and all that jazz
[11:20] tmpvar: right
[11:20] tmpvar: so i think that im going to finish the last level/core tests (3 of them)
[11:20] tmpvar: and be done with supporting random shit
[11:20] rb2k has joined the channel

[11:21] rb2k: I get an "  Error: Cannot find module 'node.io'   "
[11:21] tmpvar: few realize how gigantic of a task this is
[11:21] mape: tmpvar: Sounds like a good plan
[11:21] rb2k: npm ls installed shows node.io

[11:22] stagas: micheil: what is that?
[11:23] vyvea has joined the channel
[11:23] mape: tmpvar: Only issue now is that jsdom is a tad to heavy, starts blocking pretty bad when scraping a ton of sites at once, so I'm thinking of adding workers but the api gets not so hot then
[11:24] tmpvar: i hear that
[11:24] tmpvar: hrm
[11:24] SubStack: a node podcast! awesome!
[11:25] tmpvar: mape, the best thing we can hope for is me to stop caring about XML and for me to start caring about perf ;)
[11:25] mraleph has joined the channel
[11:25] tmpvar: the goal of jsdom is to be compliant
[11:25] tmpvar: but i think we can make it fast
[11:25] Twelve-60: SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input = incorrect formatting right?
[11:25] mape: tmpvar: A lot of low hanging fruit?
[11:25] micheil: yeah, we didn't think we could record any more episodes back in november, but then I found myself at node camp, so, we did a lot of recording
[11:25] tmpvar: with 3000 tests, i think there is definitely room to know whether or not your optimization fails
[11:25] jetienne: tmpvar: have you profiled it ?
[11:26] mape: micheil: is the noded on the itunes store?
[11:26] tmpvar: mape, yes.
[11:26] mape: tmpvar: Ah nice
[11:26] tmpvar: jetienne, sort of.. I'd love better tools. I used v8.log and gmon,out (which is mostly un-usable on osx)
[11:27] tmpvar: now that im home i can drop the gmon into kcachegrind and make magic happen
[11:27] tmpvar: from what i understand anyhow
[11:28] tmpvar: thats after the low hanging fruit, like accessing getters and recursing un-neededly
[11:28] jetienne: tmpvar: my current experience with jsdom was with jquery to parse a page... it was 10sec for a 500kb pages.... i would love a massive boost :)
[11:28] micheil: mape: no, as we don't have a website
[11:28] tmpvar: step 1, get it working, step 2, optimize
[11:28] mape: micheil: k
[11:28] sechrist: jetienne: yup
[11:28] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[11:28] tmpvar: jetienne, thats quite a large page
[11:29] tmpvar: you must understand that the html parser and jsdom are two seperate entities
[11:29] jetienne: tmpvar: ok this was a "virtual" html page... dont ask internal stuff
[11:29] tmpvar: no problem, 500k of markup is huge
[11:29] tmpvar: _huge_
[11:29] jetienne: tmpvar: yep, but i do understand a browser do the same in less than 0.5 sec
[11:29] tmpvar: cause your browser to hang huge
[11:30] tmpvar: yeah, you'd definitely notice it
[11:30] tmpvar: my point is that jsdom is working
[11:31] tmpvar: for instance, check out the massive amounts of w3 tests that is passes :  https://gist.github.com/802604
[11:31] tmpvar: i've been overly (perhaps) concerned with making it 100% compliant
[11:31] jetienne: definitly a good goal :)
[11:32] tmpvar: xml vs html is a very big gap
[11:32] tmpvar: an insane gap if you dig deep enough
[11:32] micheil: hmm.. the audio levels on this interview are really quiet.. >_>

[11:39] tmpvar: i just need some time
[11:39] tmpvar: getting jsdom out of my head for a bit will help

[15:10] syntheze: is there something like __repr__ in javascript?
[15:10] syntheze: compared to python
[15:11] |sWORDs| has joined the channel
[15:12] micheil: and what does __repr__ do?
[15:12] syntheze: eh, never mind... :-/
[15:12] syntheze: micheil, actually it is a function, that returns a string-value for a called object
[15:12] syntheze: *method, not a function
[15:12] sstephenson: require('sys').inspect(value)
[15:12] micheil: or .prototype.toString()
[15:13] syntheze: but thats the wrong approach for my app, i think. thank you anyway ;-)

[15:22] ukd1: hi guys, I'm pretty new to node, and I'm having problems getting the events from a http.createServer object - could anyone help?
[15:22] hwinkel has joined the channel
[15:23] ukd1: The problem is, I don't know where I should add the "on('close', function (errno) { .... etc
[15:23] philipha1rison has joined the channel
[15:25] |sWORDs| has joined the channel
[15:26] micheil: ukd1: hmm, okay, one momnet
[15:26] killfill has joined the channel
[15:27] micheil: ukd1: so, you'd create your server like so: var server = http,createServer(requestHandler);
[15:27] micheil: then you can attach a listener for the server's close event by doing:
[15:27] ukd1: ya
[15:27] ukd1:  httpServer = http.createServer(
[15:27] ukd1:     function(request, response) {
[15:27] micheil: server.on('close', handler);
[15:27] micheil: or, you can just string them
[15:27] ukd1: ?
[15:27] philipharrison has joined the channel
[15:28] micheil: http.createServer(requestHandle).on('close', closeHandler).listen(8000)
[15:28] micheil: should work, iirc.
[15:28] ukd1: ah ok -
[15:28] micheil: s/string them/chain them/
[15:28] ukd1: doing httpServer.on('close', handler); error's -
[15:28] ukd1: "Cannot call method 'on' of undefined"
[15:28] micheil: odd,
[15:29] ukd1: and chaining it does the same
[15:29] micheil: very odd.
[15:29] ukd1: :-)
[15:29] ukd1: I'm I'm running v0.3.7
[15:29] micheil: okay
[15:29] ukd1: v0.3.7-pre actually, if that matters

[15:38] ukd1: hmmm,
[15:39] micheil: ukd1: not that this is related to your issue, but I'd suggest moving the var db = ...; line out of your request handler
[15:39] ukd1: oddly - it's needed - having a shared db connection and multiple subs to the same channel didn't work
[15:39] ukd1: ...probably because its the same client connection
[15:39] ukd1: ...but maybe because of this disconnect issue -
[15:39] micheil: ukd1: oh, right.
[15:40] micheil: yeah, subscribe in redis blocks.
[15:40] ukd1: micheil, I think the problem might be that the client (a objc app) isn't sending an http disconnect - it's just closing the socket
[15:40] ukd1: ...so that event never fires?
[15:40] EricL has joined the channel
[15:40] micheil: nup, that shouldn't cause an error saying that there's no 'on' method

[15:42] ukd1: sure
[15:44] ukd1: http://pastie.org/1511897

[15:45] ukd1: way two http://pastie.org/1511901

[15:51] ukd1: micheil, any thoughts?
[15:51] pyrotechnick has joined the channel
[15:52] ukd1: micheil - at the moment it just doesn't disconnect until way after the client has disappeared, which keeps redis's connection open - which isn't ideal
[15:52] micheil: ukd1: sorry, no
[15:52] ukd1: micheil, thanks a lot for the help you did give though :D
[15:52] Aikar: anyone know if someones working on a plugin for Eclipse to provide CommonJS support (ie a Node.JS project type) to provide code completion for node.js, would be nice :o
[15:53] niklasfi: i have tried specifying setEncoding to binary but i still seem to get a string object instead of a buffer

[15:58] sstephenson: you need to use curses or print an ANSI escape sequence

[19:37] mnbvasd: pyrotechnick: aye, ajax is a buzzword, rather than a standard, like the cloud.

[19:44] pyrotechnick: Kingdutch: no problem. we're kinda in a different domain than facebook i think. we're going for the whole distributed thing
[19:44] pyrotechnick: but there will be public gateways for serving profiles etc nonetheless
[19:44] kristsk has joined the channel
[19:44] pyrotechnick: so i mean that kind of puts us in direct opposition to a conventional social network. but we're doing something they a) wont do and b) dont want to do
[19:45] pyrotechnick: it's more to support the game than to become a social network
[19:45] pauls: hey guys, I'm trying to update node.js to 0.3.* via npm -- i did an `npm update npm`and a `npm update node` but it only updates node to 0.2.3. Do you know how to get up to 0.3.*?
[19:45] pyrotechnick: but we hope it will mature into something more than just a game community

[19:46] sechrist: xmpp with json
[19:46] pyrotechnick: mnbvasd: what liscence and why no github?
[19:46] Kingdutch: pyrotechnick: Sounds interesting
[19:46] mnbvasd: pyrotechnick: mit, whatever you want? ;)
[19:46] mnbvasd: pyrotechnick: I cba'd putting it there, feel free to fork :)
[19:47] lep: 0.2.6 has major api changes to 0.3.7 and i want to be *future proof* but 0.3.7 does not pass the tests
[19:47] jimt has joined the channel
[19:47] pyrotechnick: mnbvasd: cool. ima port some parts onto our coffee version
[19:47] pyrotechnick: but we should head towards being totally compatible if you're going to maintain it

[19:47] hunterloftis has joined the channel
[19:47] pyrotechnick: because then we could share modules etc
[19:48] mnbvasd: I've not finalised any of it, it's more of a toy than a deployment project yet.
[19:48] pyrotechnick: yeah
[19:48] pyrotechnick: so before i look through the code
[19:48] pyrotechnick: how do you handle "promises"
[19:48] pyrotechnick: we used a state machine

[19:50] mnbvasd: pyrotechnick: I must warn you it's not great.. but just about works with most xmpp servers I've tried it with, but it requires a hacked tls.js to allow tls upgrading.
[19:51] pyrotechnick: mnbvasd: yeah we never even got around to that. ended up just doing SASL over plaintext <vomit>
[19:51] awenkhh has joined the channel
[19:51] pyrotechnick: but we'll def look into ssl
[19:51] pyrotechnick: what's the recommendation for doing that?
[19:51] mikeal has joined the channel
[19:51] pyrotechnick: SASL over ssl? or is that a stupid idea?
[19:51] saikat has joined the channel
[19:52] mnbvasd: yeah, I just offer sasl plaintext or md5-digest over tls.
[19:52] pyrotechnick: cool
[19:52] pyrotechnick: i dont get the md5-plaintext crap, can crypto do it?
[19:52] pyrotechnick: i couldn't find anything on it
[19:52] pyrotechnick: it's got a name
[19:52] pyrotechnick: i forget, but adium was requesting it and it had some strange name
[19:53] pyrotechnick: i googled the crap out of it and only ever found 1 example in php for a client not a server
[19:53] polotek has joined the channel
[19:53] pyrotechnick: i couldnt find anything about how to utilise the salt/nonce etc
[19:53] mnbvasd: well rfc3920 has a bunch of the auth stuff, and rfc2831 has the md5-digest.
[19:53] pyrotechnick: cheers!
[19:53] mnbvasd: which is quite simple if you don't use .split(/=/,2) and chop off trailing ='s signs.
[19:54] pyrotechnick: yeahhhhhh i think i regexed it
[19:54] pyrotechnick: so totally overkill
[19:54] pyrotechnick: ended up using the regex library with named captures
[19:54] mnbvasd: got code?
[19:55] pyrotechnick: for that part? or named captures?
[19:55] mnbvasd: for your xmpp server?
[19:55] mscdex: i thought you couldn't do named captures in javascript?

[19:56] ryah: polotek: hi
[19:57] pyrotechnick: mscdex: that's why you have to use a library
[19:57] polotek: which version of python is required to build node?
[19:57] mscdex: bah
[19:57] polotek: listing dependencies
[19:57] mscdex: 2.6.x or newer i would assume
[19:57] pyrotechnick: mscdex: http://xregexp.com/
[19:57] ryah: polotek: 2.4 or newer supposedly
[19:57] zylo has joined the channel
[19:58] ryah: i suspect 2.5 is actually needed.
[19:58] Kingdutch: pyrotechnick: Anyway, after the social network, named blytes, was reviewed on a dutch news site (nu.nl) the side received about 10.000 visitors (Within the next 1-24 hours?) among which a few people exploiting bugs and using DoS attacks. It's now down again because it didn't comply with some dutch (privacy probably) laws.
[19:58] mscdex: i had trouble with python 2.4 when building node a long while back
[19:58] pyrotechnick: Kingdutch: was it open-source?
[19:58] pyrotechnick: Kingdutch: we won't really have that problem ;) using DHT and crap
[19:58] polotek: The only other deps I know that aren't included are libssl 
[19:58] pyrotechnick: it's basically diaspora in node
[19:58] polotek: others?
[19:59] pyrotechnick: only we wont sell-out to zuckerberg

[20:00] ryah: polotek: no
[20:00] isaacs: pauls: npm doesn't update node.  if you want a version manager thingie for node, you can use nave or nvm or n
[20:00] isaacs: (all three installable with npm, i believe)
[20:00] Ond: Isn't yours 'nave'
[20:00] isaacs: pauls: or you can just get the code, and run `./configure && make install`
[20:01] isaacs: Ond: yeah, nave is mine
[20:01] isaacs: i use it
[20:01] Kingdutch: pyrotechnick: dont think it is
[20:01] pauls: @isaacs awesome! thanks. I'm confused by what `npm update node` does though... any info?
[20:02] pyrotechnick: Kingdutch: i think that's really the only worthwhile option TBH, open-source, as free as it can be (as in beer)
[20:02] isaacs: pauls: well, it doesn't do anything :)_
[20:02] pauls: lol
[20:02] pauls: @isaacs nave is working well, thanks again.
[20:02] isaacs: pauls: it checks for a package named "node" (which isn't found) and then if it's found (it isn't) it checks for it on the registry (which it woulnd't find) and then makes sure you have the latest version
[20:02] isaacs: pauls: so `npm update node` is like `npm update blerghaharddlssas`
[20:03] Kingdutch: pyrotechnick: Since when is beer free? :O
[20:03] pyrotechnick: Kingdutch: you damn well know what i mean ;)
[20:03] Kingdutch: No I don't
[20:04] pyrotechnick: Kingdutch: seriously though. trying to beat facebook at their own game is fruitless
[20:04] Kingdutch: You should see the bill I pay for beer, I can buy a lot of software for that
[20:04] Kingdutch: Hmmm
[20:04] Kingdutch: I don't understand the whole "Wall" thing tbh
[20:04] JohnnyL: 'You here me talkin' hillbilly boy? i ain't through with you by damned site!'
[20:04] pyrotechnick: Kingdutch: you can win. but it takes a good gamble and some very smart marketing
[20:04] Kingdutch: I think Hyves is doing a better job keeping stuff organised and clear, but it's pretty much dutch only (Although I believe there's some international users). Yet somehow people seem to be migrating to Facebook
[20:05] pyrotechnick: Kingdutch: you basically have to antipate what people will want by the time you're ready. then you have to create a fear-campaign to force people into a distributed system
[20:05] tim_smart: Because everyone is on Facebook.
[20:05] Kingdutch: They got a nice thing called Hyves Mobile, which essentially is like a normal telecom provider, with the exception that if your friends have hyves mobile too you can sms/mms and call them for free
[20:05] pyrotechnick: now diaspora has done both of those things very well. but they unfortunately have made some incredibly stupid and dangerous decisions
[20:06] pyrotechnick: i.e. taking an investment from zuckerberg in return for permenant facebook integration
[20:06] pyrotechnick: that, in the very definition of the term, is selling out and if i'd have given them as much as a single dollar i would be asking for it back

[20:09] pyrotechnick: as long as we can maintain a turn-key, hosted solution as easy as facebook and somehow monetize that without selling people's secrets i think it will be a success

[20:13] pyrotechnick: yeah i dont want hyves
[20:13] matbee: Why limit a social network to a small portion of the internet world
[20:14] pyrotechnick: hyves is a rash
[20:14] pyrotechnick: i want to be social but not that social
[20:15] Kingdutch: matbee: Well it works for me
[20:15] Kingdutch: seeing as I'm dutch, it ś a dutch company
[20:15] Kingdutch: and most people I know in the netherlands are on there
[20:15] Kingdutch: People I know from abroad are on IRC/Twitter and usually don't make it to my facebook 'friends' anyway
[20:15] Kingdutch: no offence to any of you
[20:16] matbee: yeah
[20:16] matbee: thats the way it should be
[20:16] Kingdutch: IRC atleast gives me some sense of privacy, and twitter, well you get a name age and maybe a location + some stuff I do. facebook gives you picture access which is too much imo
[20:16] Kingdutch: Hence I think hyves.nl > fb, it's native and serves me better
[20:16] Kingdutch: The Fb wall is unorganised, it's like a twitter list of spambots
[20:16] matbee: IRC is quickly becoming less 'social', and more on demand support
[20:17] Kingdutch: True
[20:17] Kingdutch: I use it for support a lot
[20:17] mape: matbee: Depends on the channel? 
[20:17] Kingdutch: Although I got my hand ful of channels where I like to have dicussions
[20:17] Kingdutch: Like this
[20:17] pyrotechnick: why the hell can apps even post to your wall
[20:17] pyrotechnick: that's the single most retarded idea ever
[20:17] pyrotechnick: i know why
[20:17] Kingdutch: Or just talk about general stuff, like the WebGL implementation (OpenGL in JS)
[20:17] pyrotechnick: so they get free advertising and money
[20:17] pyrotechnick: but i want to know why they ever though that would be a good idea
[20:17] Kingdutch: Single most, what's the most?
[20:17] pyrotechnick: Kingdutch: there's a webgl channel?
[20:18] matbee: mape, very true -- but, as a whole, the IRC realm is becoming more of a support network
[20:18] Kingdutch: pyrotechnick: I wish, I just use this channel for the stuff I need to rant about webgl
[20:18] Kingdutch: :')
[20:18] Kingdutch: Seeing as ##javascript is dead and just not as bad as ##perl
[20:18] mape: matbee: Like most of the internet is porn and news-channels are shit?
[20:18] pyrotechnick: Kingdutch: have i seen you in #three.js before?
[20:18] Kingdutch: ubt only slightly less worse
[20:18] Kingdutch: but*
[20:18] matbee: haha
[20:19] Kingdutch: pyrotechnick: Could be that I've been in there, seeing as I did check out the framework although I like to get low lvl and make my own but it's not on my auto-join
[20:19] matbee: mape, I suppose you could say that. However, IRC holds no appeal to most non-technical people..
[20:20] Kingdutch: matbee: Yeh but most people that need C++/Other stuff support that use IRC aren't that non-technical
[20:20] mnbvasd: eh? there's a social network other than irc?
[20:20] pyrotechnick: Kingdutch: i kind of did the opposite. started low level. found three.js and realised it'd save us alot of screwing around and didn't require many changes to do what we wanted (in fact mrdoob/alteredq helped us flesh out those parts of three.js) and now we've ported it to CommonJS/coffeescript
[20:20] stride: what? I know exactly one hot blonde girl that uses IRC
[20:20] rjbs: Yeah, doesn't CompuServe have those "chat rooms" now?
[20:20] stride: :>
[20:20] Kingdutch: Although Isometimes question if people should attempt something if they ask basic questions such as 'where to put this line of code'
[20:20] mnbvasd: does compuserve still exist?
[20:21] Kingdutch: pyrotechnick: I don't see the use of coffeescript, I can see it have benefits but javascript reads better to my eyes
[20:21] rjbs: No, sadly.
[20:21] mnbvasd: aw, too bad ;)
[20:21] Kingdutch: mnbvasd: It's still a magazine iirc
[20:21] rjbs: ACTION thinks he's going to try writing more parenscript soon.
[20:21] Kingdutch: It's not? Thought we still got it in the mail here
[20:21] rjbs: CoffeeScript doesn't really thrill me the same way.
[20:21] stride: http://webcenters.netscape.compuserve.com/menu/ this makes me want to hug a bear
[20:21] pyrotechnick: Kingdutch: each to his own. it's not really a style thing for us. i mean it helps. but it's about making it easier to work in a team more than anything
[20:21] rjbs: "CompuServe Classic, was shut down July 1, 2009. The newer version of the service, CompuServe 2000, continues to operate"
[20:21] matbee: coffeescript sends my eyes a blur
[20:21] pyrotechnick: we're a fan of the "pythonic" approach
[20:21] Kingdutch: pyrotechnick: Yeh I can understand that
[20:21] pyrotechnick: settles arguments
[20:21] Kingdutch: Ah ok
[20:22] mnbvasd: ah, bizzare, I gave up with compuserve after the dos client, I never really got into windows..

[20:58] pauls: i mean nave*
[20:58] isaacs: pauls: nave use 0.3.7 ; node -v
[20:59] isaacs: pauls: when you "exit", then you leave that subshell
[20:59] isaacs: the purpose of nave is to keep your node versions separate.
[20:59] isaacs: it's a bit like virtualenv, but not quite as fancy
[21:00] isaacs: pauls: to install 0.3.7 in your "regular" shell, do `nave usemain 0.3.7"

[21:04] pauls: isaacs: npm now says i'm using 0.3.7 tho
[21:04] isaacs: hm.  odd
[21:04] isaacs: seems like the node_g failed, but node worked
[21:05] isaacs: hm... nave should really always use ~/.nave so that you don't lose stuff if you upgrade it

[21:06] isaacs: sechrist: weeks, not months.
[21:06] pquerna: 0.4 is supposed to come out 'soon'

[22:00] matti: stride: I mean, I am not sure why multipart is unhappy.
[22:00] stride: oh, never used that one,sorry
[22:01] matti: stride: When request handler is inside another callback.
[22:01] matti: stride: I keep getting exception from multipart.
[22:01] dekz has joined the channel
[22:01] stride: huh? can you post the stacktrace somewhere?
[22:01] matti: stride: I mean, when fs.stat will fire callback for error back, then multipart will throw an exception too.
[22:02] matti: stride: I get the impression that they somewhat share the same Event Emitter or something.
[22:02] stride: that's weird. fs.stat shouldn't even use an eventemitter
[22:02] matti: stride: No problem, give me a second... I have changes the code slightly and now use fs.statSync()
[22:02] matti: stride: Indeed, I can't get my head around it.
[22:02] warz: looks like with dynamicHelpers i have to add a variable that i'll never use to the views, though

[22:12] matti: isaacs: If you have some time, I'd appreciate if you can have a look to. Maybe there is an issue somewhere.

[22:12] matti: isaacs: Is there an alternative?

[22:13] matti: I will take a look in a second.
[22:13] pauls: <3 formidable 
[22:13] matti: Hehe
[22:13] isaacs: if you're using connect or express, you could check out connect-form
[22:13] nejucomo has joined the channel
[22:14] matti: stride, isaacs: So, this exception from multipart is only when the switch statement is inside a callback ... whether it is path.exists and/or fs.stat ...

[22:15] tilgovi has joined the channel
[22:16] stride: sorry, been away for a smoke :)
[22:16] matti: stride: ;]
[22:17] stride: that does look more like some format that multipart-js doesn't understand than a problem in your code
[22:17] stride: is switching to formidable an option for you?
[22:18] matti: stride: Possible.
[22:18] isaacs: matti: i'd recommend switching to formidable
[22:18] matti: Would it be a lot of re-factoring?
[22:18] isaacs: felixge has more incentive to make it work than i do, since he manages transload.it, and does more upload-handling than anyone else.
[22:18] isaacs: formidable is bound to be faster, better, and more supported.
[22:20] matti: ;]
[22:20] tanepiper: formidable is the prefered example in express, and you can attach to it's event listeners

[22:26] mraleph: isaacs: just to let you know. today I had some wtf moments with npm's cryptic "Failed unpacking the tarball" errors. the reason was tarball was created by more recent version of tar so my olders tar was spamming "Ignoring unknown extended header keyword `blabla`" errors and returning non-zero exit status. You can probably mention this on wiki or even detect this situation because even verbose loglevel does not give enough information to figure our

[22:28] isaacs: mraleph: thanks.  i really hate dealing with all the different tars out there.

[22:29] hellp has joined the channel
[22:29] mraleph: isaacs: I will then go and create another one :-0 that npm rebuild did not actually rebuild stuff for me. I had to do uninstall install to rebuild certain package :-)
[22:29] isaacs: mraleph: which package?
[22:30] mraleph: daemon
[22:30] isaacs: mraleph: there was a bit of an issue with the default node-waf stuff, in that it doesn't do clean before configure build
[22:30] isaacs: mraleph: i changed that very recently.  of course, if the package overrides it with their own stuff, who can say?
[22:30] mraleph: yeah. I think that's exactly what was going on. can't npm force clean?
[22:30] isaacs: mraleph: maybe it would make more sense for rebuild to actually clean out the package folder, re-unpack, and then run build
[22:31] isaacs: clean out = remove entirely
[22:31] mraleph: yep that makes sense
[22:31] isaacs: the issue there is that you may have created some data that you *don't* want to lose, perhaps, but i guess that's really rare.
[22:31] isaacs: only nave does that, as far as i know.
[22:31] isaacs: rebuild should be like a re-install
[22:32] mraleph: stateful packages?
[22:32] isaacs: sure.  post an issue on that, too, while you're over there, please :)
[22:32] mraleph: ouch that is painful
[22:32] sholmes has joined the channel
[22:32] sholmes: what's new?
[22:32] isaacs: mraleph: nave keeps around the downloaded node source and built copies of node, so that it doens't have to rebuild unnecessarily
[22:32] isaacs: but i guess if you did `npm rebuild nave` it would'nt be surprising to lose that
[22:32] amerine has joined the channel
