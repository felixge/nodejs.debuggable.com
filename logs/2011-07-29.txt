[03:39] abraxas: SubStack: how well does it perform in your experience, compared to say google closure compiler?
[03:40] SubStack: abraxas: I haven't used google closure
[03:40] JakeyChan: hi, do you know node.js can convert pdf to html ?
[03:40] abraxas: SubStack: ah actually, they have comparison tables on https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS
[03:41] bassui has left the channel
[03:41] SubStack: plus you shouldn't ask about people's experience of performance when there are much more reliable and verifiable sources about that sort of thing
[03:42] kartmetal: abraxas, probably not a fair comparison.
[03:42] kartmetal: google closure works best on source javascript designed for google closure.
[03:42] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[03:42] kartmetal: the comparison with YUI and any other traditional minifier is valid though.
[03:43] SubStack: here it is http://www.peterbe.com/plog/comparing-google-closure-with-uglifyjs
[03:43] abraxas: kartmetal: you mean it's not fair because closure does more than just minify?
[03:43] eee_c has joined the channel

[03:45] chickamade has joined the channel
[03:45] SubStack: kartmetal: what else does it do?
[03:45] SubStack: uglify also has an AST thing that's useful too, I don't see how it matters
[03:46] kartmetal: well, the source language google closure takes isn't really javascript.
[03:46] kartmetal: it's javascript plus language hints in special comments
[03:46] kartmetal: which allows the closure compiler to do things minifiers can't really touch.
[03:47] kartmetal: it also expects a specific coding style, particularly when it comes to OO stuff
[03:47] Remoun has joined the channel
[03:47] SubStack: that sounds like an antifeature
[03:47] kartmetal: could well be.
[03:47] kartmetal: I know folks that hate the concept.
[03:48] tmzt: seems everybody has their own js now :)
[03:48] kartmetal: but if you get in the mindset that you're not writing javascript so much as writing for the closure compiler, you will get the most of it.
[03:48] tmzt: eventually v8 will just load up front ends based on the source code notation you're using or something
[03:49] SubStack: kartmetal: that sounds terrible
[03:49] SubStack: tools should get the fuck out of the way
[03:49] kartmetal: but that's why the closure compiler was written, not just to remove a few whitespaces.
[03:49] kartmetal: it will aggressively rewrite your JS when possible, inline some functions, removing dead code, etc.
[03:49] tk: SubStack: closure will work with plain JS... however if you learn the "tricks" it watches for you can get better results
[03:50] SubStack: I hate everything about that idea.
[03:50] tk: kartmetal's representation of it is very.... poorly worded making it sound like the coffeescript of the compilers
[03:50] kartmetal: sorry :P
[03:51] tk: heh
[03:51] SubStack: minifiers should minify. full stop.
[03:51] kartmetal: would it be fair to say it's kinda like GWT but with javascript instead of java as the source language?
[03:51] SubStack: GWT is even worse >_<
[03:51] tk: kartmetal: not really... apples give you oranges with GWT...
[03:51] tk: you still get JS with closure
[03:51] SubStack: I feel sorry for all those poor engineers, writing code that computers should be writing
[03:52] tk: kartmetal: I wouldnt call closure a minifier but an optimizer
[03:52] kartmetal: ok, I can get behind that.
[03:52] tk: it looks for the patterns that the compiler can take advantage of and extorts them to the fullest extent

[04:13] blaenk: hey, I have a quick thing I want to test, is there a way I can run it with node and have it dump out the errors when they occur?
[04:13] blaenk: currently the only way I can see the errors is when I enter the code manually into the repl
[04:13] tmzt: they output on the console
[04:14] tmzt: not to the browser
[04:16] tmzt: any way yet to write code once, model, view, controller, rendering, resources and possibly websocket, and have the same code run in the browser and on the server, handle validation automatically in both places, sync data structures in both places, and still be able to write custom backend (event+continuation) driven handlers that only run on the server?
[04:16] blaenk: I'm working in the console
[04:16] blaenk: I basically have a file, blah.js that's using a module and I'm running it from the console with the node command
[04:16] blaenk: but instead of giving me errors like the repl does it just keeps running and gives null values to certain things
[04:16] tmzt: it should be triggering exceptions
[04:16] blaenk: whereas in the repl I see TypeError: Invalid argument to getAgent
[04:17] tmzt: what kind of errors are you getting in repl?
[04:17] blaenk: I'm just running it as node blah.js, am I supposed to be passing a flag?
[04:17] blaenk: and in the repl I also see a stack trace

[04:26] luckysmack_: im looking to get into game development. and node seemed like a great fit. ive looked around for game design related articles centered around node but havent found many. i was wondering if anyone was willing to give some pointers on where I can look for more info. also things like if i do a game in node, what would the overall project be comprised of> just node in the back end and maybe javascript for a front end? im not quite su
[04:27] ixti has joined the channel
[04:27] jstroem has joined the channel
[04:27] tk: luckysmack_: well.... Node is javascript.... so you'd be looking at Javascript on both ends.... in that case
[04:28] luckysmack_: i was considering python as well but came to the realization that if i wanted a browser intensive game, that most of it would have to be done in JS for performance reasons. game type is multiplayer where players can all play and interact at the same time.
[04:28] luckysmack: oops had 2 windows open
[04:28] tk: your argument against python is kinda odd though
[04:29] __directory: first you'll want to just look into how to make JS games
[04:29] Aria: Well, if you want the processing distributed to the clients -- "smart clients", it makes sense.
[04:29] luckysmack: yea. and Im just not sure where that line starts/ends. ive never done game development so its somewhat new to me. most of my background is php backend stuff.
[04:29] Swizec has joined the channel
[04:30] tk: Aria: node doesnt pass processing to the client.... so how is that different than python? (besides the obvious JS/PYthon)
[04:30] luckysmack: well i like python too. i would like to use it. but node looks good as well. it seemed like i would use either node or python.  thats why I said it like that.
[04:31] tmzt: luckysmack: I started working on a game frontend/backend in node
[04:31] tmzt: with javascript client
[04:31] luckysmack: yea and those are the questions im not too sure about yet either. my JS skills are still minimal. i can do basics and some jquery fine. im still in the process of learning it
[04:31] Aria: tk: node != javascript.
[04:32] tmzt: I started with ajax but moved to websocket (not socket.io) and a server-driven system, where the client is basically a dumb client
[04:32] __directory: luckysmack: learn JavaScript game development - I mean google it like that without node
[04:32] tmzt: there's a few problems with taht approach though
[04:32] luckysmack: tmzt, so node can handle the frontend as well like JS?
[04:32] tmzt: luckysmack: uh no, I mean that js can handle the frontend unless we are using that term differently here
[04:32] tk: Aria: I'm sorry, I didnt know the v8 javascript engine handled other languages....
[04:33] Aria: tk: huh?
[04:33] tk: here I thought .js meant... javascript
[04:33] Aria: "For performance, I'd have to use Javascript" -- because then you can have most of the game happen on the client.
[04:33] tk: Aria: Node is serverside javascript, saying node != javascript is rather assinine
[04:33] luckysmack: __directory, yea ive looked that up a lot recently. and found a few decent looking ways I can do that. but i saw node as well and want to investigate it too. i just want to make sure im covering my based before starting.
[04:33] Aria: tk: node is javascript, javascript isn't node. It's not transitive.
[04:34] AvianFlu has joined the channel
[04:34] __directory: luckysmack: I know jack about game development but it does seem like you would have the game itself and use node  could provision storage and multiplayer crap perhaps
[04:34] tk: Aria: we were talking about Node vs Python... and you jump in about Clientside.... so.... yes my comment still fits
[04:34] luckysmack: heh.
[04:35] tmzt: how is python relevant to this discussion?
[04:35] Aria: tk: Well, it's the one reason I can think of that that statement is true ;-)
[04:35] jakehow has joined the channel
[04:35] Aria: And then if you have to use Javascript /anyway/, then you might as well use node, since the same language in both places is NICE.
[04:35] luckysmack: i had brough up python when i mentioned what im familiar with and what i was considering for doing games. 
[04:35] Aria: Well, that and Javascript is nice anyway.
[04:36] tk: Aria: although I will admit I did miss the "browser intensive" part of luckysmack's statement which would certainly make your comment make more sense as well ;)
[04:36] tmzt: luckysmack: one of the benifits I had in using node and js was that I could prototype some logic on the client and then move it to the server
[04:36] SubStack: it's much nicer to go the other direction
[04:37] Aria: Agreed.
[04:37] Aria: But it depends on what environ you're most comfortable in.
[04:37] __directory: booze has loosened up my thinker and i has a dumb so I would be much more concerned about physics and math with game stuff
[04:38] luckysmack: so in general, i would handle the backend in node, and the frontend in javascript. Also i say browser intensive because of being able to offload some processing on the lcient side and that clientside JS is faster than server side. thats what i meant . but still yes the UI would have many objects on it and would be complex.
[04:38] __directory: and it probably depends on what game(s) you want to make
[04:38] luckysmack: ah yes.
[04:38] Aria: Server-side javascript is just as fast. V8 on both ends if you compare to Chrome.
[04:39] luckysmack: think rts, isometric, where multiple players can play at the same time and interact live. though not all players may be present at all times. 
[04:39] __directory: I would target node as the backend for multiplayer
[04:39] __directory: `case closed`.
[04:40] euforic has left the channel
[04:40] luckysmack: Aria, yea i know server side JS is just as fast. but it also has to go through transfer from client to server which isnt as fast as doing it client side.
[04:40] binarypie has joined the channel
[04:40] tmzt: you can use node for everything if you want
[04:40] binarypie has joined the channel
[04:40] Aria: Hehe. Depends on what you're measuring the speed of.
[04:40] luckysmack: yes for the backend i am very interested in node.
[04:40] Aria: But yes. Latency of data transfer can be a problem.
[04:40] __directory: I actually would use BASIC + COBOL + GO
[04:40] tmzt: we were going to have the business backend in php but that was because one of the project members was familiar with it
[04:41] luckysmack: see thats the thing. node is still kinda out there form me. im not sure how much i can use it on the front end and how much i should use JS on the front end to make the client side as fast/clean/smooth as possible.
[04:41] __directory: well
[04:42] __directory: if you ahve to move pieces back and forth between the browser and node
[04:42] tmzt: luckysmack: start wit ha game but make it simpler
[04:42] luckysmack: im mostly familiar with php. im kinda learning python too. which is why i originally wanted to use it for the back end. node just seemed to fit the bill better.
[04:42] __directory: that should be easiest with the same language front/back and side to side
[04:42] tmzt: until you get how it should work
[04:42] tmzt: it is because it lets you keep thinking in js all the way though
[04:42] tmzt: through
[04:42] __directory: I think the most difficult part to this still is `the game` itself.
[04:42] tiglionabbit_ has joined the channel
[04:43] tmzt: and you can use the evented style in the browser too, I used Backbone but mostly for it's implementation of Backbone.Events after I moved to a iso/rts system
[04:43] luckysmack: tmzt, yea im going to build the game over a long time. slowly building small apps to represent different parts in the game. then over time peice things to gether (or rewrite if thats the best route, for the end game)
[04:43] tmzt: you could also use EventEmitter from browserify
[04:43] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[04:43] tmzt: what kind of game is it?
[04:44] luckysmack: to be honest, the game backend, the engine, i already have largely mocked up on my computer.
[04:44] luckysmack: well the one in mind is an rts.
[04:45] tmzt: I was using an observer style setup with eventemitter, then having an observer that watched those events and sent them back to the client
[04:45] luckysmack: think like starcraft or any other game like that but in MMO fashion
[04:45] tmzt: that part actually worked pretty well
[04:45] luckysmack: ok.
[04:45] srid has joined the channel
[04:46] luckysmack: to be honest im not sure what you mean by an observer style setup. unless im just not thinking straight.

[04:48] Lorentz: Just don't write programs around patterns.
[04:48] Lorentz: Describe your code with patterns :3
[04:48] SubStack: Lorentz: I strongly disagree.
[04:48] tmzt: SubStack: yeah, but at least that one is pretty well defined

[04:48] blaenk: has anyone used the node-xmlrpc module?
[04:48] blaenk: https://github.com/baalexander/node-xmlrpc
[04:49] SubStack: tmzt: well you could have just as well said "an eventemitter sent events back to the client"
[04:49] Lorentz: SubStack: Perhaps your idea of patterns are something beyond just another vocab to describe "code layout / design / etc"?
[04:49] tmzt: essentially I had a basic event that came from the client, then it would trigger other events that would mutate it and and trigger events in turn
[04:49] Aria has joined the channel
[04:49] tmzt: SubStack: yes, but that's more content free than what I said
[04:49] luckysmack: i looked up observer pattern. i know what you mean now
[04:49] SubStack: tmzt: I find them to be equivalent
[04:50] SubStack: using event emitters /implies/ this "observer pattern"
[04:50] SubStack: fuck everything about design patterns
[04:50] luckysmack: heh
[04:50] SubStack: I hate them so much.
[04:50] Aria: I am so with you.
[04:51] blaenk: arya stark
[04:51] Aria: (They're brilliant if you use them to recognize patterns, not as a cookbook.)
[04:51] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[04:51] Aria: (but man, when you have to debug a FooBarStrategyManagerFactoryImpl, you need to go hurt someone.)
[04:52] SubStack: Aria: I haven't even found them to be useful in describing patterns
[04:52] AvianFlu has joined the channel
[04:52] SubStack: it's like calling it a pattern just nounifies where some verbs would be much more appropriate
[04:52] Aria: HEh.
[04:52] Aria: Possibly.
[04:53] SubStack: it's like passive voice in this respect
[04:53] luckysmack: ok. so since im still in the process of learning javascript. should i thoroughly go through my JS learning before getting started with node? or is it feasable to take what i know and start learning node. seems like they are so similar that finishing JS first will have benefits as well.
[04:53] SubStack: "having an observer" versus "observes"
[04:53] luckysmack: aside from the fact that i would still need to learn it better for the front end
[04:53] SubStack: although a more specific verb than observes would probably be even better

[04:57] dguttman has joined the channel
[04:57] luckysmack: yea. so you think ill be fine just starting out with node for a while.
[04:57] luckysmack: picking up JS better later on.
[04:57] luckysmack: when i need it
[04:57] tmzt: just start :)
[04:58] tmzt: you'll pick it up qukly
[04:58] luckysmack: yea. thats what i did with JS and python. lol
[04:58] tmzt: (node *is* js(
[04:58] luckysmack: well. yea. heh
[04:58] __directory: lol
[04:59] luckysmack: so ok start with node. im going to do that. but in general when making these kind of apps, where users should be able to interact live with other players, does node have everything i need or are there other libraries i should look into?
[04:59] AvianFlu: luckysmack: get a github account, and check out search.npmjs.org
[05:01] tmzt: luckysmack: eventually you mgiht want a message queue, like zeromq, redis pub/sub etc.
[05:01] tmzt: but get it working on one server first
[05:01] tmzt: a few things to remember
[05:01] tmzt: a node instance is a server instance, every variable you define globally is going to be there between requests
[05:02] tmzt: any state you want to add is something you add yourself, or use a framework like express or connect etc.
[05:02] tmzt: node *just* processes events and runs callbacks in response to those events, when no more events are pending it exists
[05:02] tmzt: exits
[05:02] luckysmack: AvianFlu, yup, have a github account. 
[05:03] AvianFlu: I hadn't read up when I said that
[05:03] luckysmack: craaap. so many tabs open right now in chrome for crap you guys say. i need to look at them all still. hah.
[05:03] tmzt: get an editor window and start writing :)
[05:04] tmzt: do the examples on the nodejs.org page, the look simple but they have to make sense before you will be able to effectively move on
[05:04] tmzt: get a feel for it essentially
[05:04] tmzt: love the nesting anonymous functions :)
[05:05] luckysmack: AvianFlu, ah. i didnt say it. you mean this: search.npmjs.org thats for using couchdb for a DB? im familiar with mongodb and would like to use that.
[05:05] AvianFlu: search.npmjs.org is for searching the npm repository of node modules
[05:05] tmzt: uh you can use either
[05:05] AvianFlu: so, it's for everything you'd want that somebody else wrote already
[05:05] binarypie has left the channel
[05:06] tmzt: yeah, hopefully
[05:06] luckysmack: oh heh. i thought you were referring to the github repo.

[05:08] materialdesigner: (which is, sadly, a lot of things)
[05:08] luckysmack: yea frameworks was another question entirely. i saw express, connect, and geddy. coming from using full stack frameworks, geddy (from posts i read about the frameworks) seemd more akin to what im used to using.
[05:08] tmzt: it's harder to get help with it
[05:08] luckysmack: cool thanks
[05:09] tmzt: and takes you away from the bare metal
[05:09] luckysmack: yea
[05:09] tmzt: which you'll need if you're doing a game
[05:09] tmzt: get to know express and if you need it, connect
[05:09] materialdesigner: I use express and enjoy it a lot
[05:10] luckysmack: ok cool. thanks
[05:10] materialdesigner: it's surprisingly simple, yet powerfully flexible
[05:10] tmzt: it's simple and similar to  wsgi etc.
[05:10] luckysmack: yea express seemed to be the other good one.

[05:11] __directory: express is what you want
[05:12] tmzt: express you do somethikng liek app.get('/page', function(req,res){res.send('The page');});
[05:12] tmzt: and then in the browser /page will be that message
[05:12] luckysmack: granted i havent looked into them much yet. what makes express different or better than geddy? 
[05:12] luckysmack: oh. interesting
[05:13] tmzt: or you can do templates with jade, like res.render('index.jade',{option: 'test'}); and have a page like #{option}
[05:13] tmzt: which will render as test
[05:13] tmzt: very simple

[05:13] __directory: i hated how rails abstracted stuff so much - express puts me closer to the guts - and what what I like as a C guy
[05:14] tmzt: yeah, so you can have a user object and define app.use(function(req,res,next){req.user=getMyUser(req.session['userid']);next()});
[05:14] tmzt: and every request will have a req.user object
[05:14] kartmetal: opinions about connect-router vs express?
[05:15] skm has joined the channel
[05:15] luckysmack: yea, coming from php and frameworks like cakephp and yii, i do like some magic. it nice. things like helpers. but i also agree, as long as i can still do what i need without feeling like theyre in the way.
[05:15] __directory: i think there's some helper addons
[05:15] tmzt: oh, there's also express-resource now
[05:15] __directory: but im not aware of any
[05:15] tmzt: which is a bit like controllers in php frameworks or resources in rails
[05:16] tmzt: haven't played with it yet and it's a little different than the declarative syntax I'm used too in express, but it looks good
[05:16] __directory: i think im going to use Backbone and do more client side stuff on this project
[05:16] tmzt: __directory: express-resource looks like a good fit with backbone
[05:16] chrisdickinson: hypothesis: it seems easier to approach express if you've worked with rails or (particularly) sinatra before.
[05:17] __directory: tmzt: i would assume so eh..just need REST resources for backbone, right?
[05:17] tmzt: right
[05:17] luckysmack: tmzt, yea MVC is what im mostly familiar with.

[05:19] __directory: do the hands on node book
[05:20] tmzt: when you're ready for express, go to expressjs.com and do that one
[05:20] luckysmack: yea. i want to learn the system first. been there done that having to learn by existing code i didnt know. screw that
[05:21] tmzt: um

I am working on 10 diffrent 'tickets' a day and change all the time between them forward and backward sometimes days or weeks backward. If I do not want to have 'analog protocol' as many of my colleques have, I need some digital assist and that is e.g. mylin within eclipse. Its possible to have remote-debugging node only by console and browser, but for me its much

[07:17] framlin: SubStack: here we are about 100 peaople that develop and administrate a business-critical system, that is 25 years old and that has evolved every day since its first line. Some of the people sitting here are working on that since 15 years. There is a culture and this culture is much much more powerfulll that any software-development-methodology ever will be ;)
[07:18] Lorentz: You don't need to try to rewrite the entire thing to test. Start small. Even just doing some functional testing helps.
[07:18] NickABusey has joined the channel
[07:18] SubStack: yep
[07:18] Lorentz: And just keep on building from there. Build a culture of testing into the system.
[07:18] SubStack: just little pieces
[07:18] SubStack: incrementalism!
[07:19] SubStack: if you've got a pretty good test suite you can modify pieces without worrying too much about breaking everything
[07:19] zilch_ has joined the channel
[07:19] framlin: Lorentz: I know how to test, I have worked as a QA for some years some years ago. But it is not enought if 1 Person knows that and is willing to do that ... that the culture I wrote about ..
[07:20] Lorentz: Even if one person does it, it's better than no one doing it.
[07:20] Lorentz: And thankfully, tests build up, and broken tests are a good way to learn more about the business process, so it's a win-win.
[07:20] framlin: .... thats all theory ....
[07:21] Lorentz: Nope, it's practical
[07:21] Lorentz: I started at this company few months back, had absolutely no testing in place other than two testers.
[07:21] framlin: But, are they willing to test?
[07:21] Lorentz: I have a small selenium thing being built on, because tacking on entire unit testing was going to be too much at this point in time, but it's already saved me many days of work.
[07:21] framlin: do they think test could be good for anything?
[07:22] Lorentz: Yep, even the testers think at least functional testing can be automated
[07:22] Lorentz: And they're learning
[07:22] Lorentz: Too bad they can't code, so I need to prod them along, but ultimately it saves time. Eventually.
[07:22] framlin: and what would happen, if you told them, you need a little DB to have "frozen" data for tests?
[07:23] framlin: what about, if its obviously such a huge amount of new software each day, that you would need 10 people to test ist and you have onl one?
[07:23] Lorentz: I don't get what you're asking, but we have db replications in place for these things, with few control DBs for last-word-period.

[07:27] framlin: SubStack: and that is the realy crazy thing, I would never have belived this 5 years ago, but it works ...
[07:27] Lorentz: Even the data doesn't have to be accurate. Make up your own data, see if it breaks or works.
[07:28] Lorentz: If it breaks because you fed it wrong data, you just learnt something too.
[07:28] Lorentz: Ultimately
[07:28] framlin: that software is good enough for the business it hase to do and it is far far far cheeper than having al that QA stuff around it ....

[13:32] vortec: hi guys, i'm looking at the child_process module. i fail to understand how stdout is a stream, as the "data" event (for spawn()) is only triggered when the process has finished. the process i call outputs data before, then has a long pause, then outputs some more. why doesnt it trigger the "data" event before the pause?
[13:32] vortec: -before*
[13:32] galaxywatcher has joined the channel
[13:33] chjj: vortec, well it would depend on the process, why wouldn't a process' stdout be a stream?
[13:34] vortec: [disclaimer: i'm new to node.js] i expected it would trigger data two times
[13:34] tuhoojabotti: Disclaimer denied.
[13:35] vortec: so that i can work with the first chunk once its out, then work with the second chunk

[13:52] jarek: would it be possible with Node.js to fetch any random site from the web, inject additional script into it and display it on 127.0.0.1?
[13:52] jarek: I guess I mean a proxy server
[13:52] tuhoojabotti: Yes.
[13:52] jarek: but it would also have to inject some additional scripts
[13:52] bradleymeck: still yes, you would have to do some parsing though
[13:53] jarek: ok, so what should I google to find some sample code? I tried googling "node.js proxy server", but I can't find any example that would show how to inject stuff into proxied websites
[13:53] tuhoojabotti: jarek: Just use http.get and then parse and reply?

[21:13] noyum: By the way, the client has build in logic to handle when server closes, it stores messages in an arrray, and when the serve comes back up, it flushes the array

[21:41] sridatta: ryah: yes, from inspector. I am trying to cut down on as many dependencies/libraries as possible so we can narrow down a bare-minimum test case
[21:41] bnoordhuis: technoweenie: that's all you do with stream.pipe()? how big is big btw?
[21:42] bayousoft has joined the channel
[21:42] tmm1: bnoordhuis: the app is basically receiving http requests, making outbound http requests and then piping the responses
[21:42] technoweenie: anyway from a few k to 2GB+
[21:42] technoweenie: this is for github tarball downloads
[21:42] technoweenie: we used to serve the tarballs through nginx
[21:43] _skm has joined the channel
[21:43] bnoordhuis: technoweenie tmm1: right, so it's essentially a proxy?
[21:43] technoweenie: yea
[21:43] technoweenie: tmm1: we could put nginx on the fs's and see if those node processes still leak
[21:45] bnoordhuis: technoweenie tmm1: i'll see if i can reproduce it here

[21:48] EyePulp: tjholowaychuk: it does reduce the CPU hit somewhat if I limit the files it's watching, but it's still a pretty big cpu hit (e.g. watching two small .js files I still bounce around 20% cpu).  Should I post an issue on github?  I haven't got the cleanest smallest example, just a lot of local anecdotes.
[21:48] tjholowaychuk: EyePulp hmm, well try it with node directly first

Apologies, but I'm heading out for a while.  just upgraded to master of the current node - cpu appears quieter (with the node_modules folder being ignored for reloads).  I'll whine about this later, I'm sure.  thanks for listening... =)

[22:36] slifty: noob question for folks -- I have a native OSX application sending a stream of data to a node server.  Currently sending it in bursts of HTTP but I can only assume there is a faster way
[22:36] mikeal: slifty: HTTP is fine
[22:37] mikeal: i mean, if it's one persistent connection
[22:37] iammerrick: How do you prevent jade from escaping things again?
[22:37] mikeal: not much difference between HTTP and raw TCP after the connection is setup
[22:37] slifty: well I suppose that's part 2 of the question...
[22:37] iammerrick: doh #{}
[22:38] slifty: the application is built on OpenFrameworks; maybe Socket.IO can interface with that somehow...

[22:45] slifty: hmmm -- anyone seen an OSC library for node.js?

[23:46] bnoordhuis: is the test case anything like your app?
[23:47] technoweenie: yup pretty much just like it
[23:47] bksf: anyone? :P
[23:47] bnoordhuis: only it's not leaking :)

[23:47] technoweenie: except our connections are open way longer.. it takes people much longer to download 2GB
[23:48] bnoordhuis: okay, what happens if you bump CONTENT_LENGTH to <some bignum>
[23:48] technoweenie: oh i bumped it to 2GB, and the requests arent done
[23:48] bnoordhuis: yeah, that'll take a while
[23:48] bnoordhuis: took a couple of minutes here
[23:48] NickABusey has joined the channel
[23:49] technoweenie: yea i suppose downloading ~200GB will 
[23:50] bnoordhuis: bksf: not in node core
[23:50] bnoordhuis: but there are daemonization tools out there
[23:50] bksf: bnoordhuis: any ideas on a solution? or .. in rails we have shotgun, it lets you run an app and reloads changes on the backend without a restart ..
[23:51] bksf: will node reload new changes or are they in memory?
[23:51] bksf: the initial code -
[23:51] technoweenie: node wont
[23:51] technoweenie: you'd need to write something like shotgun
[23:51] clifton has joined the channel
[23:52] jhurliman: bksf, nodemon will do that
[23:52] tjholowaychuk: bksf or cluster's reload() plugin
[23:52] jhurliman: although i just use it for local dev, not on our production server
[23:52] cognominal_ has joined the channel
[23:52] tjholowaychuk: if you're using that
[23:52] zmbmartin: tjholowaychuk: any ideas on this error  https://gist.github.com/1114977
[23:53] bksf: jhurliman: sweet perfect thanks :P
[23:53] tjholowaychuk: zmbmartin what are you passing to listen()?
[23:53] geetarista has left the channel
[23:53] zmbmartin: tjholowaychuk: just in cluster I think
[23:54] tjholowaychuk: no i mean like what value are you passing to the .listen() method :p
[23:54] bnoordhuis: technoweenie: what's memory usage like?
[23:55] zmbmartin: tjholowaychuk: a port number?
[23:55] tjholowaychuk: zmbmartin are you sure it's not a string
[23:55] tjholowaychuk: because if it is node will try to use it as a local socket path
[23:55] tjholowaychuk: which looks like what is happening
[23:55] tjholowaychuk: by that vague error
[23:56] tjholowaychuk: if you are doing .listen(process.env.MY_APP_PORT) or something
[23:56] zmbmartin: tjholowaychuk: this is the cluster part of my app.js https://gist.github.com/1114994
[23:57] tjholowaychuk: sockets are not pidfiles, but try removing that setting and see if it works
[23:57] tjholowaychuk: the dirs need to exist as well cluster doesn't currently create them for you
