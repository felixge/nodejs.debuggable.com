[00:01] shanebo: Nuck, do you know how to chain functions where the following function gets passed to it the next function as an arg that can be called on when completed?
[00:01] Nuck: shanebo: Fraid not
[00:01] shanebo: AvianFlu, do you know how to chain functions where the following function gets passed to it the next function as an arg that can be called on when completed?
[00:01] shanebo: :)
[00:01] Nuck: shanebo: Sounds like you're looking for a way to chain easier than callbacks?
[00:01] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/1934
[00:01] mmalecki: actually, that assertion over there makes little sense
[00:02] eddyb: bnoordhuis: thanks
[00:02] AvianFlu: shanebo, do you mean chaining like a.b.c.d.e or just having functions fire in a chain
[00:02] eddyb: also, even if target == host == OH FUCK
[00:02] eddyb: I get it
[00:02] eddyb: no, I don't
[00:02] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: please, verify it so that I can go to sleep ;)
[00:02] eddyb: for half a second I thought v8 was building once for ia32 and once for x64, but they aren't
[00:02] eddyb: *it isn't
[00:03] bnoordhuis: eddyb: i think it's a gyp bug but don't quote me on that
[00:03] eddyb: bnoordhuis: story made short: it think it's cross-compiling

[00:05] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: I hate to say it, but works here...

[00:05] eddyb: NOOO
[00:05] shanebo: to handle middleware
[00:06] AvianFlu: okay, the trick is to put the functions in an array
[00:06] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: maybe you're using nvm or nave or whatever?
[00:06] eddyb: forgot to add -std=c++0x, now I get to see v8 built again
[00:06] eddyb: TWICE
[00:06] AvianFlu: and have next() be your iterator that calls the next one
[00:06] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: try to run test fixture itself
[00:07] AvianFlu: you should look at the code to async.forEach, it's a good reference

[00:17] eddyb: mmalecki: thanks
[00:18] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: but it has to work. node --version ?
[00:18] bnoordhuis: mmalecki: master
[00:18] bnoordhuis: and the latest 0.4 branch (what else?)
[00:19] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: yeah, but notice that it runs just `node`. so you may be running ./node, but it still runs /usr/bin/node or whatever
[00:19] mmalecki: so it doesn't really matter which node you use to run it
[00:19] mmalecki: what matters is `which nodez
[00:19] bnoordhuis: oh right, don't do that :)
[00:19] mmalecki: *`which node`
[00:20] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: what should it run instead?
[00:20] bnoordhuis: mmalecki: process.argv[0]
[00:20] mmalecki: ah!

[02:19] CarterA: Do any of you use OS X? Because OS X has a built-in system for asynchronous work like libel and libeio called dispatch, and I'm thinking that libuv could use dispatch as a back end on OS X.
[02:19] CarterA: *libev
[02:19] teadict: what's libuv? sounds core-ish
[02:19] CarterA: It's the platform layer for node.
[02:19] isaacs: CarterA: libuv uses ev/eio on os x
[02:20] isaacs: CarterA: afaik, there are no plans to change that.
[02:20] CarterA: Right. But dispatch would *probably* be faster.
[02:20] isaacs: it works well.
[02:20] isaacs: CarterA: you're not allowed to utter such words without math.
[02:20] CarterA: Considering dispatch has kernel-level optimizations.
[02:20] teadict: probabilities don't win the battle against working stuff
[02:20] jerrysv: i wonder how many production node instances are running on os x
[02:20] CarterA: 0 to none.
[02:20] teadict: "this driver will probably make my X work better" then it breaks
[02:20] jerrysv: compared to dev work on os x, which is huge
[02:20] isaacs: CarterA: even if it is faster, it has to be faster enough to justify the added complexity
[02:21] CarterA: …probably not. Again with the "probably".
[02:21] jerrysv: and dev work on os x doesn't need to be 100% optimized

[04:55] jesusabdullah: appliance-like?

[04:56] SubStack: konobi: npm init is like that I guess?
[04:56] Nuck: SubStack: That's not what npm init does o_O
[04:56] jesusabdullah: Maybe make a web interface to nconf
[04:56] Nuck: SubStack: npm init creates a package.json IIRC
[04:56] konobi: jesusabdullah: when you set up an appliance (mail, firewall, etc) you generally have to go through some sort of wizard to configure it
[04:56] jesusabdullah: http://github.com/indexzero/nconf
[04:56] jesusabdullah: Oh okay, sure

[04:57] Nuck: konobi: I had a Pokemon-themed config tool for my NodeJS deviantART chat bot >_>
[04:57] Nuck: I made a progess indicator and other such magick
[04:57] jesusabdullah: Yeah, I haven't heard of one but it's probably not too hard to build right?
[04:57] jesusabdullah: like, nconf has all the hooks for latching onto the configs programmatically, so you just need to expose that through an app
[04:57] konobi: most of the work is probably doable on the front end, but there's some back end logic too... =0/
[04:58] hij1nx has joined the channel
[04:58] Nuck: konobi: Backend seems easier to me
[04:58] jesusabdullah: konobi: look at nconf. i think it would take care of a lot of that backend
[04:58] Nuck: The frontend would be best with something like ncurses
[04:58] Nuck: But AFAIK, there's not pure JS ncurses-like module
[04:58] jesusabdullah: Nuck: charm does ncurses-like stuff with ansi
[04:59] jesusabdullah: which is way more awesome
[04:59] jesusabdullah: you could easily build an ncurses-like api on top of that
[04:59] jesusabdullah: or some kinda ui-ish thing
[04:59] Nuck: jesusabdullah: It's a lot harder than it seems :V

[05:03] Nuck: JakeyChan: Do you mean there's a .js file you want to access that's in the folder with teh node binary?
[05:03] Nuck: torm3nt: Express.
[05:03] jesusabdullah: I think I see what you're asking JakeyChan, maybe
[05:03] JakeyChan: geddy, 
[05:04] JakeyChan: you can try it 
[05:04] torm3nt: Nuck - only express?
[05:04] Nuck: torm3nt: No, it's just the one I recommend.
[05:04] JakeyChan: :D
[05:04] torm3nt: ah, cheers :)
[05:04] JakeyChan: I am reading the node source code
[05:04] JakeyChan: include C++ code
[05:05] JakeyChan: I found node.js source file here :)
[05:05] jesusabdullah: I can't really endorse any framework, but if I had to pick one to go with it'd be express
[05:05] JakeyChan: go to lunch :D
[05:07] jesusabdullah: JakeyChan: If you're asking what I think you're asking: I don't 100% know how node bootstraps its javascript, but based on how couch does it I suspect that they start a v8 interpreter with raw bindings to libuv, execute some set of javascript code, and then start executing your program
[05:07] fangel has joined the channel
[05:08] jesusabdullah: What couch does is compile a spidermonkey interpreter, then execute a bunch of javascript code that sets up a sort of event loop kinda thing that you communicate with using json messages over stdin and stdout
[05:08] jesusabdullah: from what I saw anyway
[05:08] Nuck: lolspidermonkey

[05:09] isaacs: jesusabdullah: start reading here: https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/src/node.cc#L2508
[05:09] jesusabdullah: I think spidermonkey has some weird stuff in it and I suspect that c++ is in ways a better choice than java
[05:09] isaacs: jesusabdullah: it's not very much like couch, actually
[05:10] jesusabdullah: ah!
[05:10] isaacs: jesusabdullah: the story starts getting good around https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/src/node.cc#L2186
[05:10] jesusabdullah: It looks like a lot of core is in the c?
[05:10] jesusabdullah: c++ I mean?
[05:10] jesusabdullah: I'm pretty pants at c++
[05:10] Nuck: jesusabdullah: You're pants
[05:10] Nuck: wat
[05:11] jesusabdullah: It's a british thing. I picked it up on irc as a kid
[05:11] jesusabdullah: for some reason it stuck

[05:15] isaacs: compile it all together
[05:15] isaacs: it'd be nice if you could do that with a package bin post-hoc, you know?
[05:15] isaacs: like a nodecc thing
[05:15] Nuck: isaacs: I'm still waiting for compiled node + js files
[05:15] isaacs: then get a binary that bundles node and your thing

[05:16] Nuck: haha
[05:16] Nuck: isaacs: Awesome yeah

[05:20] Nuck: Ah right
[05:22] isaacs: Nuck: so, if you use _third_party_main.js, then you'd have to roll your own module system.
[05:23] isaacs: Nuck: which would kind of suck

[06:37] secoif: how are you guys testing APIs?
[06:38] secoif: Ideally there would be a library with setup/teardown + simple 'connect to this url, validate response' 
[06:38] secoif: but this doesn't seem to exist
[06:39] secoif: trying tobi/vows/api-easy, but can't get any to run with async setup
[06:39] secoif: which seems like madness
[06:40] secoif: idk wtf I'm doing wrong but it seems like noone has ever needed to run an async setup before running their tests before

[06:43] groom has joined the channel
[06:44] secoif: SubStack perhaps I'm doing testing wrong, but the idea was to seed the db with dummy data to test against
[06:44] secoif: and some test harnesses, eg vows, will exit reporting 'no tests to run' if you don't export any tests immediately 
[06:45] SubStack: exports for tests doesn't work so well in my experience
[06:45] SubStack: I like tap style tests the best. You just call a function.
[06:45] SubStack: or you can just use the assert module directly too
[06:46] secoif: expresso/vows both do it == 80% of my nodejs testing experience
[06:46] SubStack: a lot of my old tests are in expresso still but all of my new stuff is in tap

[06:56] secoif: :D
[06:56] secoif: ok.
[06:57] secoif: I will try this out.
[06:58] tylerwayne: Quick question: In v0.5.10 on Windows, what would cause an exception that reports "Error: use fs.watch api instead". Specifically, this is happening inside the CoffeeScript compiler.
[06:58] secoif: it's kinda similar to nodeunit
[06:59] secoif: tylerwayne a search for that error gave me this https://github.com/isaacs/node-supervisor/issues/26
[07:00] secoif: "The fs.watch API is changing in node 0.5, and hasn't yet been stabilized, afaik."
[07:00] secoif: possible that the coffeescript module isn't up to date
[07:00] tylerwayne: Is it a breaking change with regards to fs.watchFile?
[07:01] tylerwayne: Sure seems like it is.
[07:01] secoif: tylerwayne no idea, perhaps you should just double check everything is up to date, and failing that, just leave off the -w switch  
[07:01] secoif: on the coffee command
[07:01] aliem has joined the channel
[07:02] tylerwayne: I may have to do that, at least until I can rewrite the commands to use fs.watch.

[08:35] Frippe_away has joined the channel
[08:35] Industrial: I have a question about REST architecture. Say I have a /users/:id resource, Do any sub resources need to be named plural, even though there's only one instance/member of that sub resource? e.g. /users/:id/monsters/0 instead of /users/:id/monster ?
[08:40] Tobbe: Industrial: REST doesn't say anything about how to name your resources
[08:41] Tobbe: /users/:id/moster is perfectly fine
[08:41] Tobbe: *monster
[08:42] isaacs: Industrial: you could even have /users/:id/monster/:monsterid
[08:42] markwubben has joined the channel
[08:42] stagas has joined the channel
[08:42] isaacs: Industrial: teh more important thing is to use the right verbs and semantics
[08:43] eddyb: isaacs: meant to ask you something: did you write the zlib bindings? if so, what was the reason for leaving sync calls out?
[08:43] isaacs: like, accept headers for content-type to determine json vs xml vs html; PUTs, GETs, HEADs, DELETEs being idempotent (ie, safely repeatable), GETs and HEADs being cacheable
[08:43] isaacs: eddyb: it's too hazardous.  no reason why that couldn't be added later.
[08:43] Tobbe: talking about this. How do you do nested resources using express-resource?
[08:43] eddyb: thanks
[08:44] eddyb: just saying, there are about 3 packages out there doing sync zlib stuff
[08:44] isaacs: eddyb: the issue is that if you're unpacking a big file, it's tempting to think of sync zipping as "fast" since it's in memory.
[08:44] Industrial: isaacs: I keep thinking in terms of actions instead of resources, e.g. 'I want the dashboard of the user so I need /users/:id/dashboard', but I think I should really think about what kind of data the dashboard needs (e.g. 'events') and create a GET /users/:id/events instead
[08:44] isaacs: eddyb: in fact, it can be quite slow, if the compression is turned up.
[08:44] eddyb: isaacs: could have a hardcoded limit
[08:44] eddyb: I'd be using it for small buffers
[08:44] Tobbe: I just thought about "GETs being cacheable". Let's say you have /users/:id  wouldn't the response change if, for example, the user changes his email address?
[08:44] eddyb: things coming over a net stream
[08:45] isaacs: eddyb: ok.  as you say, there are libraries that do this already
[08:45] eddyb: and the way it's implemented, sync works best
[08:45] isaacs: but this was the simplest way to provide a complete lowlevel binding to everything zlib can do
[08:45] eddyb: yes, but having async zlib in node and sync in other places is kinda weird
[08:45] jbpros has joined the channel
[08:45] eddyb: </rant>
[08:45] isaacs: the API lends itself well to an asynchronous streaming approach

[12:40] CrisO: JakeyChan: https://github.com/visionmedia/express-resource
[12:40] vkareh has joined the channel
[12:40] CrisO: jebberjeb: http://mongoosejs.com/
[12:40] blup has joined the channel
[12:42] jebberjeb: Cris0, any particular reason why mongoosejs?
[12:42] jebberjeb: CrisO, why not just use the native drivers?
[12:43] CrisO: mongoose provides validation, getters, setters, hooks, etc.
[12:44] martin_sunset: jebberjeb: Because you will eventually need all the stuff in mongoose
[12:44] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[12:44] boehm has joined the channel
[12:44] martin_sunset: jebberjeb: Eventually =  three days into the project
[12:45] jebberjeb: So I'm looking at the page and maybe I should ask this in #mongodb, but here goes anyways. I thought part of the appeal of mongodb was that it was schemaless. And the *first* thing you see with mongoose is schema definition.
[12:45] jebberjeb: so, uh the question there is, doesn't that bother anyone?
[12:45] jebberjeb: apparently not huh
[12:45] martin_sunset: jebberjeb: The database is schenmaless
[12:45] jimt_ has joined the channel
[12:45] martin_sunset: jebberjeb:  that does not meet that all your data is
[12:46] martin_sunset: Basically, you can drop almost anything you want in mongo, but for most
[12:46] martin_sunset: Apps it makes sense to classify this in program code,
[12:46] LifterAH: incidentally there are a couple of useful videos on Mongoose at NodeTuts (http://nodetuts.com/)
[12:46] martin_sunset: Often people use a mix and match approach example:
[12:46] LifterAH: might be of some use
[12:47] jebberjeb: martin_sunset: I guess. I mean, I can't imagine writing data access code without a well defined schema, so it's fine for me.
[12:47] martin_sunset: jebberjeb: Just evangelizing :)
[12:47] LifterAH: I think one of the benefits of it being schemaless is that you have the flexibility to extend the collections at any time
[12:47] jebberjeb: martin_sunset: that's what I'm looking for, so thanks ;)
[12:47] martin_sunset: jebberjeb: Schenmaless is great for upgrades
[12:48] martin_sunset: jebberjeb:  or when you need to store additional data, think customer records
[12:48] jebberjeb: right
[12:49] jebberjeb: alright, I've got node, express (w/ jade and sass) and mongodb w/ mongooose. Am I missing anything?

[13:00] jebberjeb: I'm a long time java dev, and if I use ringojs, I'd get hooks to the massive set of tools I'm really familiar with.
[13:00] jebberjeb: I want to use node though -- just puts me out of my comfort zone. 
[13:01] secoif: jebberjeb why use node if you're not going to use node?
[13:02] jebberjeb: secoif -- having hooks to what you know are a good hedge against a demanding schedule
[13:02] blup has joined the channel

[13:12] thdbased: You mean there is new stuff coming concering Mongoose
[13:12] LifterAH: Mentioned it earlier, but there's a video on NodeTuts covering Mongoose
[13:12] garrensmith: thdbased: depends on what you want to do then choose the db

[17:01] EyePulp: with as much of a module ecosystem as is growing up around node, it sometimes feels like design decisions are made to node w/o regard as to the impact.  With something this new that's an obvious risk, but the truth is node's popularity is becoming tied to the enthusiasm of the developers building modules for it.  That's a difficult relationship to maintain with constant core changes.  (my two cents, with a limited knowledge of actual d

[17:02] deedubs: tjholowaychuk: I agreed was just looking for backing that node 0.5 was faster

[17:03] isaacs: deedubs: haven't tested with express apps
[17:03] isaacs: deedubs: but there's a few benchmarks in node, and they get run frequently.  ryah is a strict taskmaster with making sure that node cannot be allowed to get slower, ever.

[17:09] isaacs: deedubs: were you sending datagram packets over unix domain sockets?

[17:10] isaacs: also, you can no longer pass arbitrary file descriptors in as many places.
[17:10] isaacs: var stream = new net.Stream(fd) <-- don't know if that works now, but it didn't for a while.
[17:10] EyePulp: if the goal is 100% equality across platforms, it seems like you end up with the least features limited by the weakest platform.  If it's super-corner-case issues, then it's probably not worth whining too much about.  I'm not smart enough to know the difference. =P
[17:10] isaacs: you can still open sockets, though.

[17:40] jaredhanson: The docs are pretty extensive, and its fully operational, so it should work out of the box.
[17:40] jaredhanson: Let me know if you have any questions, though, after you dive into it.
[17:40] martin_sunset: jaredhanson: Cool, thx. I'll integrate it this week
[17:41] Lemminkainen: tjholowaychuk: does node.js handle asynchronous get/posts nicely when you distribute code sharing like that?
[17:41] tjholowaychuk: Lemminkainen: why wouldn't it?
[17:41] Lemminkainen: Django doesn't, so I have to ask because I no longer give automatic trust
[17:42] tjholowaychuk: hm
[17:42] secoif: jaredhanson: that's amazing, i was just looking for this this morning
[17:42] jaredhanson: secoif: thanks! glad you like it
[17:42] secoif: Lemminkainen by code sharing, tjholowaychuk is talking about using the same code on server as on the client… is that what you mean with django? 
[17:43] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[17:43] secoif: jaredhanson as in, that's exactly what I was talking about.
[17:43] Lemminkainen: secoif nope, Django doesn't do that nicely and I'm trying to wrap my head around how node.js differs and improves (hopefully) on other web frameworks here
[17:43] tjholowaychuk: not really a node thing
[17:43] tjholowaychuk: just a js thing
[17:43] tjholowaychuk: node is not really comparable to django
[17:44] tjholowaychuk: and by not really, I mean not at all :D
[17:44] Lemminkainen: excellent
[17:44] tjholowaychuk: much lower level but you can stitch together the 3rd-party libraries pretty easily to craft what you want
[17:44] Lemminkainen: so tjholowaychuk what about node.js gets your epeen excited?

[17:46] secoif: haha, I had a feeling you wouldn't like it

[17:47] jaredhanson: secoif: my biggest point - auth libs that mount routes in your app violate encapsulation.  I avoided that, and so a simpler API can be exposed

[17:47] martin_sunset: Lemminkainen: That's typical code that contains lots of queries, one after the other. Pita
[17:47] secoif: eg, it makes it really easy to fire off a bunch of requests in parallel, and only move to the next step once all have finished
[17:47] secoif: saves, a good, 3 lines of code
[17:48] AvianFlu has joined the channel
[17:48] Lemminkainen: thanks martin_sunset but shouldn't it be possible to make queries modular?
[17:48] jaredhanson: secoif: both everyauth and connect-auth mount routes, which left me with an uneasy feeling and made certain integrations challenging
[17:49] cdibened has joined the channel
[17:49] jaredhanson: martin_sunset: as in you want to be the oauth provider, rather than the client?
[17:49] martin_sunset: Lemminkainen: Yes, actually hook.io + noflo will do that for node and business logic
[17:50] secoif: martin_sunset you're using hookio in production?
[17:50] martin_sunset: jaredhanson: Yeah, I use rack-auth-server from aasaf I ruby, need something similar in node
[17:50] p1d has joined the channel
[17:50] Lemminkainen: martin_sunset: \o/
[17:50] martin_sunset: secoif: For background tasks, yes. Wrote a bunch of hooks
[17:51] martin_sunset: secoif: That was a learning experience, I can tell you :)
[17:51] jaredhanson: martin_sunset: I haven't seen that in Node yet, but its high on my to-do list to provide a wrapper for that in Passport
[17:51] jaredhanson: martin_sunset: and implement a necessary lower-level OAuth 2 server module, if necessary

[17:54] tjholowaychuk: after installing the dev deps
