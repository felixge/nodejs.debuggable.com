[00:00] domino14: thats true. the username/timestamp is plain text, it's just sorta amazing to me how it's untamperable
[00:00] JaKWaC has joined the channel
[00:00] domino14: well.. without quantum computers
[00:01] mattrobenolt: It is… for however large your window is with the expiration time. ;)
[00:01] mattrobenolt: But in most cases, those urls aren't really exposed to a user to even have knowledge of it.
[00:01] mattrobenolt: What we use it a lot for is when kicking data over to a third party service that has callback hooks.
[00:01] mattrobenolt: Like, Twilio.
[00:01] AvianFlu has joined the channel
[00:02] domino14: ah
[00:02] mattrobenolt: Because technically we have to expose a public url for Twilio to hit on an incoming call.
[00:02] mattrobenolt: So we sign the values we send it to know if they're legit.
[00:02] mattrobenolt: And we sign cookies so they can't be tampered with.
[00:04] mattrobenolt: We also use signed session ids in urls for Node since the requests may be coming from a completely other domain that can't read a cookie.
[00:04] jbrokc__ has joined the channel
[00:04] jbrokc___ has joined the channel
[00:04] mattrobenolt: In that case, they'd have to know somebody elses session id and signature to act as someone else, which is highly unlikely.
[00:05] mattrobenolt: The person would have to go out of their way to make themselves vulnerable, and in that case… fuck it. It's like giving someone your password.
[00:06] domino14: aha
[00:07] mattrobenolt: If you're using it as a part ofa public url, yes, you should shove in a timestamp and hash the whole thing. Then there's a small window where it's vulnerable. That's how the S3 private files work.
[00:07] mattrobenolt: You make a signed request with a timestamp, and you can view the file… authenticated as whomever, for that window of time.
[00:07] storrgie has joined the channel
[00:08] domino14: you would still have to go out of your way to give someone else that hash

[00:17] mattrobenolt: It's cool, it's fun, it can do nifty things in a short amount of time. Performance and memory usages are adequate enough for most people.
[00:17] domino14: deoxxombie: exactly
[00:18] HardPhuck has joined the channel
[00:18] mattrobenolt: It'll easily get you to a next step. I haven't deployed Node into an environment where there are 100k+ concurrent users yet, so I can't attest to how well it scales at that point or if things need ported to another language such as Scala or Erlang.
[00:18] relative has joined the channel

[00:19] sdwrage has joined the channel
[00:19] quackquack has joined the channel
[00:20] mattrobenolt: It's quick and easy to pick up and most projects don't need to get into that level of concurrency. Anything 10k concurrent or less can more than likely run on one server pending the complexity of the app it's running.

[00:21] domino14: so i think eh is definitely a pretty cool guy
[00:21] dwasp: plus it's new so you can charge a lot of money for consulting
[00:21] mattrobenolt: Redis is your best friend when it comes to clustering.
[00:21] isaacs has joined the channel
[00:21] domino14: yeah, using Redis pubsub to talk to node.js
[00:21] mattrobenolt: Just store everything in Redis instead of local memory, and you're good to go. Redis can easily handle like, 60k ops per second.
[00:22] domino14: it kicks so much ass
[00:22] domino14: i got a very basic example working in a few hours despite never touching node.js before
[00:22] mattrobenolt: We use Redis all over. As storage, cache, and pubsub.
[00:22] domino14: with your awesome crypto help i might even get something working by tonight
[00:22] mattrobenolt: Exactly. You'd never get that that quickly in Erlang or Scala or any of the other serious platforms.
[00:23] mattrobenolt: I treat those as the next step. When shit's really going down. Twitter relatively recently switched their entire backend to Scala. And Facebook uses Erlang for the backend of their chat.

[00:25] franksalim: i believe v8 is faster than erlang for most workloads
[00:25] mattrobenolt: At least that's how it is from my understanding. I don't work there, obviously.
[00:25] franksalim: so i'm not sure why erlang would be "next level"
[00:26] tiagobutzke has joined the channel
[00:26] mattrobenolt: franksalim: I honestly don't know enough about Erlang to make a solid comment.
[00:26] franksalim: no problem
[00:26] mattrobenolt: That comment isn't based on real life experience. Just how things are perceived.
[00:27] mattrobenolt: At the point where I'm serving an app with 100M+ users, I'm sure all aspects will be assessed severely. Until then, Node is doing just fine.
[00:27] mattrobenolt: A little cluster of instances running behind nginx is handling well.
[00:27] franksalim: when you have 100M users, you'll care more about benchmarks than perception :)
[00:27] mattrobenolt: Exactly.
[00:27] franksalim: or you'll hire someone who does
[00:28] franksalim: to care for you
[00:28] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[00:28] mattrobenolt: I meant perception of the industry. Erlang and Scala are just typically looked at as the high performance enterprise async tools, blah blah blah. People tend to think of Node as a toy.
[00:28] _unary has joined the channel
[00:29] torm3nt: that's because it's new
[00:29] mattrobenolt: But in that instance, everything is evaluated and whatever comes out on top would obviously be used. Node is a great tool to get to that evaluation.
[00:29] torm3nt: rails was thought of as a toy as well until it started pushing in the big boys' league
[00:29] sineltor: yeah. ruby too. And python, back in the day.
[00:29] torm3nt: yup
[00:29] mattrobenolt: Yeah, only time will tell.
[00:29] sineltor: yeah.
[00:29] franksalim: unix, or so the history tells me
[00:29] sineltor: heh
[00:29] torm3nt: node is good for web apps, but not good for computations
[00:29] franksalim: x86
[00:30] mattrobenolt: As far as I know, nobody is using Node in some ridiculously high scale yet.
[00:30] torm3nt: linkedin is
[00:30] franksalim: everything we take for granted today was fresh and untrusted at some point in the past
[00:30] domino14: mattrobenolt: you mention nginx . i know that cant proxy websockets. are you just using long polling? does it work fine?
[00:30] sineltor: nodejs is getting pretty mature though
[00:30] torm3nt: they moved from rails to node
[00:30] mattrobenolt: For what aspect?
[00:30] torm3nt: their mobile app/web
[00:30] mattrobenolt: domino14: nginx can proxy websockets with a patch.
[00:30] echoSMILE has joined the channel
[00:30] torm3nt: they said they were able to scale down their infrasturcture from 15 servers/cluster to 4 servers/cluster to handle load

[00:30] mattrobenolt: https://github.com/yaoweibin/nginx_tcp_proxy_module
[00:31] mattrobenolt: That works well.
[00:31] coreb has left the channel
[00:31] mattrobenolt: Ahh, nice! I didn't know LinkedIn was using it. Do you know roughly how much traffic they're serving through their mobile?
[00:31] teadict: trying to confirm my view of a real time app.. generic structure would be to socket.io everything performing database operations on the server side functions that are called by the clients; functions which shoot the client side function when done databasing.. right?
[00:31] teadict: it's like ajax but no, but dynamics are similar
[00:32] teadict: all this using express as middleware.. right?
[00:32] mattrobenolt: domino14: If you're using SSL with websockets, AKA wss, you can do it as well if you slap stunnel in front to terminate the SSL. Again, that works well and is in production right now on a Facebook game we deployed.

[00:36] torm3nt: god I hate javascript's syntax
[00:37] domino14: it really knows how to leverage the best parts of js
[00:37] torm3nt: no matter how neat you keep it, it still looks like spaghetti
[00:37] teadict: torm3nt: it hates you back
[00:38] torm3nt: liar, that would imply that javascript has emotions, which is impossible as a material human creation.

[01:31] domino14: does anyone know how node_redis achieves event-based mechanics for pubsub? as far as i know pubsub listen is blocking. how is it that it can connect to the redis server and not block when subscribed?
[01:32] Aria: The redis connection blocks. Node doesn't.
[01:32] Aria: To node, it's just a message arriving.
[01:32] domino14: isnt there some limit to how many redis connections will be blocking?
[01:33] Aria: (The connection blocking means the connection can't do anything else; node not blocking means that it can however move on and just wait for the event.)
[01:33] Aria: Sure. How many sockets can you open to redis? that many.
[01:33] chilts: yeah, node just idles when nothing is happening, it doesn't block :)
[01:33] avian__ has joined the channel
[01:34] Aria: There's limits -- Redis's per-connection overhead, node's per-connection overhead, the OS's limit on file descriptors.
[01:34] domino14: i want to have an open connection per user
[01:34] domino14: a pubsub subscription per user. makes it simpler.. but that may be bad?
[01:34] prudhvi: Hi, i have a json object that looks something like this {"@": Obj}, which i get after parsing from xml. Now, how should i extract the Object member?
[01:34] Aria: Could have just one pubsub subscription and have the user's name be part of the message.
[01:35] domino14: yeah.. just thought of that. how do i associate a client with data in node.js
[01:35] Draggor: prudhvi: yourVar['@']

[08:51] Nuck: I just told Thunderbird to archive my backlog of messages from the mailing list, so I can keep up more from now on
[08:51] Nuck: It just nearly killed my system
[08:51] eddyb: basically if (!parent.paths) parent.paths = [];
[08:51] Nuck: 11,000 messages
[08:51] eddyb: parent in that case is a string
[08:51] eddyb: setting a property on a string, AFAIK, is bogus and does nothing
[08:52] Nuck: Best part is that 2 new emails came in during the time it took to archive those 11k
[08:52] abraxas: eddyb: technically, it works and can be used to one's advantage… but in this particular case, maybe not what they're trying to do
[08:52] eddyb: abraxas: technically, it doesn't
[08:52] abraxas: damn, you're right
[08:52] eddyb: assigning a property on a string does nothing
[08:52] abraxas: how did that happen
[08:53] eddyb: so someone screwed up
[08:53] eddyb: this is in lib/module.js
[08:53] eddyb: I have no fucking idea why it only trips for my thing, and not for your node

[09:00] eddyb: like, for latest master, does ./node start repl?
[09:01] abraxas: haven't played with it yet
[09:01] eddyb: because if it does, it's worse: somewhere it's leaking errors
[09:01] abraxas: well, since repl is native
[09:01] abraxas: it wouldn't hit that piece of code
[09:01] abraxas: I think
[09:01] abraxas: (line 231)
[09:02] eddyb: main is required with null as parent
[09:02] eddyb: I think it should be changed for repl, too
[09:02] eddyb: abraxas: yeah, I don't have it included yet, that's most likely why it fails
[09:02] abraxas: that must be it then, for native module, it doesn't care about the parent
[09:02] abraxas: it won't have to do filesystem lookups
[09:03] eddyb: yepp
[09:03] burningdog has joined the channel

[12:06] zeta01341: only to my routes

[12:07] zeta01341: For some reason, everyauth's middleware seems to be getting processed right immediately before a route is called, after all the other middleware. Or, this is some other weird magic it's doing that isn't middleware at all.

[12:47] lmatteis: yes i have.
[12:48] sineltor: (shouldn't it be encoding: 'utf8' ?)
[12:49] lmatteis: sineltor: it's the same

[16:22] mattrobenolt: Hey, sorry about that commit. I didn't even look to see what the .destroy() method was. :)
[16:23] isaacs: no worries.
[16:23] isaacs: that's what reviews are for :)
[16:23] isaacs: i'm in a hurry to get it working asap so it can be in 0.6, though.
[16:23] mattrobenolt: Yeah, I didn't even run it. I just stuck it in and called it a day, haha
[16:23] mattrobenolt: So I should just clear out the listener for 'end' and 'error' and we're good?

[16:31] zipR4ND has joined the channel
[16:31] annoyance-bot: shouldn't be
[16:31] annoyance-bot: im looking right at it
[16:32] isaacs: mattrobenolt: so... if you fix the destroy() thing, and replace it with .removeListener explicitly (as in your gist), then I think the only issue is that compressString(engine, str, cb) should probably be compressBuffer(engine, buf, cb), since it's not actually going to always be a string.
[16:32] annoyance-bot: i'll republish the latest
[16:32] annoyance-bot: in case it was an npm thing
[16:32] Glenjamin: ah cool

[16:37] isaacs: npm should really not try to hit the registry (or at least, not mind failing to hit the registry) if it's got the thing in cache

[16:44] mmalecki: isaacs: yes, from my couch
[16:44] isaacs: mmalecki: are you in admin party?  if not, you must supply an admin username and password.
[16:44] TheJH: mmalecki, you might want to check whether it's maybe still replicating?
[16:44] isaacs: a 401 is definitely you not logging in properly.
[16:44] isaacs: it needs authentication.
[16:44] TheJH: ah, right
[16:44] isaiah_ has joined the channel
[16:44] mmalecki: isaacs: the weird thing is, I am in admin party
[16:45] isaacs: mmalecki: that's 100% a couch error, then, sorry.

[16:45] TheJH: mmalecki, sure? are you using futon or the cli?

[16:54] TheJH: mmalecki, maybe you should ask in #couchdb
[16:54] isaacs: mattrobenolt: so, not sure if i'm reading this right, but it looks like the exports.unzip, inflate, gunzip could use the same compressBuffer function.
[16:54] mmalecki: TheJH: possibly. I will try later
[16:54] isaacs: just provide an Unzip() as the engine

[21:54] wankdanker: baudehlo: let me add, that i just added the required deps via npm, could i have a newer version of node-iconv?

[23:18] coderdad has joined the channel
[23:18] TheJH: b_i_d, does that mean you'll write your own async library?
[23:19] TheJH: b_i_d, people say it helps you appreciate the commonly used ones :D
[23:19] b_i_d: Hm. I'm gonna take it like a little man then... :D
[23:19] TheJH: :P
[23:19] TheJH: b_i_d, other persons async lib or none?
[23:19] tahu has joined the channel
[23:20] TheJH: b_i_d, I'd recommend caolans "async"
[23:20] TheJH: !npm info async
[23:20] jhbot: async by Caolan McMahon, version 0.1.15: Higher-order functions and common patterns for asynchronous code
[23:20] b_i_d: Debug and plaster my screen with "USE CALLBACKS, IDIOT" post-its should be enough for now.

[23:23] b_i_d: It's an artificial intelligence and for every user-input countless modules are started (emotions, common sense, memory, knowledge, etc) to construct the answer.
[23:24] b_i_d: So a lot of places I can break stuff. ;)
[23:24] TheJH: b_i_d, be sure to reserve the first callback argument for errors or it might blow up when you use it together with some async lib
[23:24] b_i_d: Yeah. I do that anyway.
[23:24] jhbot: I am only artificial stupidity :(
[23:25] b_i_d: Although I handle most of the error-stuff with events and listeners.
[23:25] b_i_d: Aww, poor bot. Not that I wanna replace you...
[23:25] mmalecki: I wonder why do people emit in nextTick sometimes
[23:26] SargoDarya: wtf. When I do var foo = function(){ this.bar = 'test'; } and try to console.log foo.bar it gives undefined?
[23:26] SargoDarya: any idea why?
[23:26] mikeric has joined the channel
[23:26] b_i_d: See? Callbacks... :D
[23:27] perezd: SargoDarya: construct it
[23:27] perezd: foo = new function() ..
[23:27] SargoDarya: ok

[23:32] perezd: get an idea of what you're trying to accomplish

[23:33] lukemelia has joined the channel
[23:33] SargoDarya: perezd: I was trying to call this in the var foo = function(){} to set some initial values but it seems they are kindly ignored
[23:33] perezd: what do you intend foo to be
[23:33] perezd: an object? a function? 
[23:33] benvie: a callable function with properties?
[23:34] perezd: thats not really a thing
[23:34] perezd: you have objects, and you have functions
[23:34] perezd: objects have properties 
[23:34] perezd: functions are functions
[23:34] SargoDarya: Wait a second
[23:34] perezd: functions can create objects, with properties, and those properties can be functions too
[23:34] charlenopires has joined the channel
[23:35] lyte has joined the channel
[23:35] lyte has joined the channel
[23:35] benvie: well a function object
[23:35] perezd: benvie: yes, but thats not what you want it to be in this case
[23:35] benvie: which is callable as functionName() but also has functionName.property
[23:35] AvianFlu_ has joined the channel
[23:35] perezd: I really don't think thats a thing
[23:35] benvie: well it's just a function
[23:35] perezd: how does that imply that it has object like properties?
[23:36] benvie: because you can call it but also access its properties
[23:36] perezd: is that working out for you?
[23:36] benvie: well it's basically a singleton pattern
[23:36] benvie: a callable singleton
[23:37] perezd: I am very worried about what you're trying to do
[23:37] benvie: which requires you to be aware that its callable is going to be treated as a constructor

[23:37] AvianFlu_ has joined the channel
[23:37] benvie: well I know what I'm doing but I'm not asking questions =D. SargoDarya is
[23:37] perezd: so prototypal languages don't have the notion of singletons 
[23:37] perezd: every object is effectively a singleton
[23:38] perezd: well
[23:38] perezd: not true
[23:38] benvie: the singleton pattern produces a singleton like object in that if try to create a new one it just returns the original copy
[23:38] perezd: you basically need to closure out a singleton at a higher level
[23:38] perezd: http://javascript.about.com/od/byexample/a/objectoriented-singleton-example.htm
[23:38] perezd: thats a way to do this
[23:38] benvie: exactly
[23:38] perezd: properties on functions is not
[23:38] perezd: you need something to build you the singleton 
[23:38] perezd: that is not itself
