[00:01] carpeliam: hm, i'm just starting to look into this, and i'm not sure if i'm grokking the difference between pub/sub, RPC, sockets
[00:01] Aria: Pub/sub is a "central coordinating node" pattern. RPC is request-and-response to do something remotely. Sockets are a transport layer for doing either.
[00:02] SubStack: with pubsub or rpc you can emulate the other
[00:03] Aria: For sure. 
[00:03] carpeliam: thanks Aria :) yeah SubStack that's kind of what i was thinking... i mean, pubsub seems like it aligns: for a game with multiple rooms, everybody in a room "subscribes" to the messages for that room
[00:04] Mrfloyd has joined the channel
[00:04] Aria: Yeah.
[00:04] Aria: They're at an equivalent layer of the stack, but differently shaped.
[00:04] carpeliam: but that's not to say you couldn't use sockets to do that
[00:04] Stephen has joined the channel
[00:05] Aria: Yeah, but you'd be making pubsub yourself ;-)
[00:05] aliem has joined the channel
[00:05] SubStack: or getting EventEmitter to do all the work
[00:05] carpeliam: Aria: exactly, and on top of pubsub i'd be making authentication etc
[00:05] SubStack: that's what dndoe does
[00:05] Aria: Yeah.
[00:05] Aria: Or before you get pubsub working.
[00:05] SubStack: *dnode

[00:31] rpj8: shoot. i still have no idea why dnode isn't working.
[00:31] rpj8: this is madness
[00:31] meatmanek: tmzt: I'm not familiar with facebook canvas, but the same origin policy comes to mind
[00:32] tmzt: I'm more worried about socket.io using window.top
[00:32] tmzt: this seems like the right way to go about it, it's a game so I need the logic on the server
[00:33] tmzt: okay, another question, but has anybody actually done anythign with spludo? I don't want to break with express entirely but it would be nice to have some kind of structure

[00:37] marcusalmeida: hi guys. is it possible to run jasmine tests on node.js ?
[00:37] carpeliam: marcusalmeida: yes, i'm using jasmine-node
[00:38] tmzt: okay, what I want to do is expose a lazy list of objects and have server side methods on them, I'm trying to figure out how to do that with mongoose and dnode, it should just work though
[00:38] rpj8: SubStack: alright, i'm totally doing something wrong here.
[00:38] rpj8: SubStack: I tried the example from github and I get `n = ?'
[00:38] tmzt: this get's handled correctly?
[00:38] marcusalmeida: carpeliam: thx
[00:38] SubStack: rpj8: you should open up a debugger already
[00:39] SubStack: rpj8: also what browser?
[00:39] rpj8: firefox 4.0.1
[00:39] SubStack: try in chrome
[00:39] SubStack: also are there any errors in the debugger?

[04:09] gazumps has joined the channel
[04:09] mikegerwitz: Dinosaurus: I'd do some profiling using JS. If it doesn't perform like you'd expect, then you can try writing it in C++. Bit manipulation is fairly basic, so I'm not sure what a module would provide you
[04:10] mikegerwitz: Dinosaurus: Unless you found a module with specific algorithms you need
[04:10] Dinosaurus: js has no unsigned types

[17:54] tjholowaychuk: gsmcwhirter what's up?
[17:55] tjholowaychuk: hahaha
[17:55] gsmcwhirter: ah, great. so i used to be using spark2 and had it plugged into an upstart script to start/stop/restart. is that possible w/ cluster or not recommended?
[17:55] tjholowaychuk: gsmcwhirter http://learnboost.github.com/cluster/docs/cli.html is probably the plugin you are looking for
[17:55] tjholowaychuk: by default cluster has no cli
[17:56] gsmcwhirter: tjholowaychuk, yeah, i saw that. what i liked w/ using upstart was easily plugging it into something like monit. i guess I can reconsider how i do that instead of forcing cluster into upstart though
[17:57] quackquack: tjholowaychuk, what directory structure do you use/recommend for complex web apps? (using expressjs)
[17:57] addisonj_: quackquack, express-namespace and express-resource help with that
[17:58] quackquack: ah, thank you. ive seen the resource one, but not express-namespace
[18:00] tjholowaychuk: quackquack i use pretty typical stuff, nothing fancy really, LearnBoost just breaks the routes into logical files so we have {teacher,student,common,parent}.js etc
[18:01] tjholowaychuk: and break those into smaller files as we grow
[18:01] quackquack: so those are like controllers, and they are all loaded by the app.js file?
[18:02] masylum_: good thing about express is that you can structure your code as you want
[18:02] dguttman has joined the channel
[18:02] quackquack: yeah, im still getting the hang of it. i am new to express and node
[18:02] quackquack: coming from rails
[18:03] addisonj_: copying rails default structure is not a bad thing to do... MVC is pretty readable
[18:03] tjholowaychuk: quackquack kinda yeah, they are still defined as regular express routes
[18:03] tjholowaychuk: instead of controller-style like rails or something
[18:04] quackquack: so more sinatra like, combining controller+routes
[18:04] tjholowaychuk: yup. i know people dont like typing app.get('/teacher/:id/blah/bah', fn) all the time
[18:04] tjholowaychuk: but at the end of the day
[18:04] tjholowaychuk: that makes it extremely easy to hunt down a route
[18:04] tjholowaychuk: even though slightly more verbose, it's very explicit
[18:04] tjholowaychuk: which i like
[18:05] tjholowaychuk: but yeah express-{namespace,resource} for people who like that sort of thing
[18:05] quackquack: true
[18:05] plop has joined the channel
[18:05] tjholowaychuk: nothing annoys me more than trying to find a route lol

[18:05] blueadept has joined the channel
[18:06] quackquack: yeah, ive had some problems w/ rails routes in the past
[18:06] quackquack: having to `rake routes` just to figure it out gets old. rake is so SLOW
[18:06] tjholowaychuk: haha yeah even people with express-resource have issues already
[18:06] tjholowaychuk: trying to figure out how things map
[18:06] tjholowaychuk: since it's not so explicit.
[18:06] tjholowaychuk: rake sucks
[18:06] tjholowaychuk: make
[18:06] tjholowaychuk: ftw
[18:06] quackquack: agreed, rake has an unexplainably massive startup time
[18:07] niftylettuce has joined the channel

[18:09] level09 has joined the channel
[18:09] quackquack: it wouldnt exist probably
[18:10] kbni: for some reason j(template_file, {locals:{use_css:'blue'}}, cb..) is not replacing {use_css} in the output
[18:10] quackquack: i almost said we would use HAML, but he ported that, too
[18:10] kbni: I've obviously done something horribly wrong, but what? :S
[18:10] tjholowaychuk: kbni hmm
[18:10] tjholowaychuk: kbni jade directly?
[18:10] addisonj_: nothing wrong, tj wrote jade is all
[18:10] tjholowaychuk: jade.compile(stringOfJade)

[18:19] CodyGray has left the channel
[18:20] kbni: tjholowaychuk: perhaps my jade is outdated :D
[18:21] tjholowaychuk: you're doing .call()
[18:21] ryanmcgrath has joined the channel
[18:21] tjholowaychuk: which means you would use "this.use_css"
[18:21] addisonj_: tmedema, did you check the docs? there is an optional object you can pass in with options
[18:21] tjholowaychuk: just do template({ use_css: 'whatever' })
[18:21] kbni: I took out the .call
[18:22] kbni: same
[18:22] tmedema: addisonj_: I did yes, I'm afraid I cannot find such option

[18:26] tjholowaychuk: kbni https://github.com/visionmedia/jade/blob/master/lib/jade.js#L205-224
[18:27] RVS: addisonj, So, Mongoose is cool, but I can't perform a simple Atomic query. It always cause error Mod on _id is now allowed %) But I don't change id. My doc update query: { '$push': { 'votes.up': user_id }, '$inc': { 'votes.value': 1 }
[18:27] jomoho has joined the channel
[18:27] tjholowaychuk: as long as you are passing locals to the returned function it should be fine
[18:27] kbni: when you say 'passing locals', what do you mean?
[18:28] tjholowaychuk: fn({ foo: 'bar' }) like you were doing

[18:28] vikstrous: anyone know how to do a text search in the db with a regex with mongoose?
[18:29] Corren has joined the channel
[18:29] tjholowaychuk: kbni jade does with (locals){ rest of template here } internally
[18:30] tjholowaychuk: which is what exposes them as pseudo globals
[18:30] addisonj_: RVS, mongoose tries to do away with a lot of the atomic queries, instead you should find your object, then for example "doc.push(new Vote({up: user_id, value: 1})); docs.save();

[18:33] tjholowaychuk: specially the portions he wrote
[18:33] kbni: tjholowaychuk: jade -o '{locals:{use_css:"blue"}}' < template.jade <- this also fails for me :S
[18:33] insin: ice burn!
[18:33] tjholowaychuk: the community grew it ok i suppose but it still has huge nasty flaws
[18:33] u4ea: tjholowaychuk: dude, cmon man - they are using md5 instead of timestamps - thats huge
[18:33] u4ea: thats like.. obvious?
[18:34] tmedema: addisonj_: ah, something like "nice --adjustment=10 ffmpeg [args]", that would work I guess
[18:34] kbni: tjholowaychuk: perhaps my template is broken? http://pastie.org/2057561
[18:34] u4ea: tjholowaychuk: next we will hear you decry the mediocrity of jQuery?
[18:34] tjholowaychuk: u4ea jquery sucks too
[18:34] kbni: there's also renice :)
[18:34] u4ea: the unwashed masses and their mashed up bits of code
[18:34] tjholowaychuk: the only thing good about it
[18:34] tjholowaychuk: is that it is cross browser
[18:34] systemfault: jquery is very bad API-wise IMHO
[18:34] u4ea: not many libraries arent'
[18:35] tjholowaychuk: if it werent for that i would never use jquery
[18:35] tjholowaychuk: systemfault yeah i agree
[18:35] jetienne: how do you explain its overwhelming sucess then ?
[18:35] tjholowaychuk: some parts are fine
[18:35] RVS: rails is not junk. It's for diff - create fast and be slow, i gues =)
[18:35] systemfault: Their version of the "filter" function is... "grep" :/
[18:35] u4ea: err? Dojo, YUI3, MyLibrary!?
[18:35] systemfault: YUI3 is good
[18:35] systemfault: I use it at work.
[18:35] addisonj_: jquery gets the job done, but man it is ugly and quirky
[18:35] u4ea: nice, I sneaked it in at work, now finally, a year later - getting everyone on board
[18:36] systemfault: u4ea: You know the problem with those libs? They don't have the ecosystem jQuery has.
[18:36] tjholowaychuk: systemfault it's all very non-js-like, backwards params for each/map etc, awkward
[18:36] tjholowaychuk: the ajax api
[18:36] tjholowaychuk: is brutal
[18:36] systemfault: u4ea: I can write JS just fine but if a damn plugin already exists, I'll just check the src quickly and just use ut.
[18:36] systemfault: *it
[18:36] jetienne: stable api, well documented, those are super strong points for jquery
[18:36] systemfault: And jQuery being the most popular... there's TONS of plugins.
[18:37] insin: zillions of plugins mashed into the jQuery namespace regardless of suitability :/
[18:37] u4ea: systemfault: quality vs quantity etc? You are right though, you can find a plugin / example / snippet for just about anything - the problem is that you often have to spend longer time debugging it or vetting it than it would be to just write it
[18:37] systemfault: u4ea: I agree so I guess it's both an advantage and disadvantage

[18:37] u4ea: In our system we have a succession of abandonware plugins, from prototype to the husks of 3 different 'redboxes'
[18:38] CodyGray has left the channel
[18:38] tjholowaychuk: and a lot of them are terrible
[18:38] tjholowaychuk: like drupal modules
[18:38] tjholowaychuk: 95% crap
[18:38] systemfault: Drupal is a CMS, it's "normal"
[18:39] systemfault: My conclusion is that CMS guys always suck at writing front-end code :/
[18:39] u4ea: its nice to have a 'vibrant community' but someone has to maintain them, and most people just write them to get the blog post, the social networking cred or are otherwise not inclined to maintain it for a succession of browsers and jquery versions going forwards
[18:39] systemfault: The JS/HTML/CSS is always terrible.
[18:39] addisonj_: Drupal (6 at least) is a twisted mess to start with, give the modules devs a break ;)
[18:40] kristsk has joined the channel
[18:40] u4ea: I think that is probably true with many 'community contributed' plugins, but also a reason to consider relying frameworks that has extended functionality from the originating party

[18:41] systemfault: I just checked it quickly, looks fine.

[20:04] vikstrous: quick question for anyone who can answer: is [].forEach() synchronous or asynchronous? :/
[20:04] MooGoo: sync
[20:05] bloodsucker has joined the channel
[20:05] bloodsucker: tmpvar, hi! :)
[20:05] vikstrous: yeah i thought it should be, but the syntax is like asynchronous functions
[20:05] MooGoo: callback functions dont nesecarily mean async
[20:05] vikstrous: okay
[20:06] bloodsucker: tmpvar, Do you have any idea with my problem with nide-ogl execution? :(
[20:07] MooGoo: foreach is basilcy this: Array.prototype.forEach = function(callback, this) { for (var i=0; i<this.length; i++) callback.call(this, this[i], i, this) };
[20:07] MooGoo: er
[20:07] MooGoo: well this wouldnt be this in the arguments list

[22:55] Chani: I guess I have to alter the first to have a function that takes the args as well as being runnable on its own...

[22:59] tc444: Chani: ya if you just split out your functions into different files and use module.exports = YOURFUNC;

[23:10] bloodsucker: tmpvar, hi. You have time now for explain you why is happening in my computer when exec node-ogl? (today i am in my home but the result is the same)
[23:10] bloodsucker: tmpvar, :P:P
[23:11] level09: can node server be attacked ? like DOS attacks for example ? or slow post ?
[23:11] burg: is there any event emitted when response.connection.destroyed becomes true on a http request?
[23:12] telemachus: level09: I would assume any server could be attacked
[23:12] level09: I had the the connection count jump from 5k to 9k within seconds today
[23:12] bloodsucker: level09, telemachus exactly.
[23:12] level09: but what are the ways to prevent that ?
[23:12] bloodsucker: level09, in fact node server is more fast than a apache but...
[23:12] ryanmcgrath has joined the channel
[23:12] bloodsucker: prevent??

[23:12] AddZero has joined the channel
[23:13] level09: there are ways 
[23:13] level09: mod_security for apache
[23:13] jmoyers: mod_sec doesn't stop DOS
[23:13] jmoyers: you're still going to get overwhelmed, especially if its a good ddos
[23:13] jmoyers: you tell your upstream provider to stop the madness
[23:13] level09: okay, so my point is that should I do anything special ?
[23:13] yoav_: you put node behind nginx, and use nginx to handle it
[23:13] level09: my upstream is ec2
[23:14] level09: our sysadmins know nothing about nginx
[23:14] level09: :D
[23:14] yoav_: http://wiki.nginx.org/NginxHttpLimitReqModule
[23:14] yoav_: http://wiki.nginx.org/NginxHttpLimitZoneModule
[23:14] level09: nice
[23:15] level09: I want to start migrating to this server
[23:15] yoav_: you can also use nginx as a load balancer and just have a bunch of node processes running
[23:15] burg: or how else can i find when connection has closed?
[23:15] _beau: is node behind nginx going to be a permanent thing?
[23:15] _beau: i remember hearing that it was a temporary solution 
[23:15] Chani: can I make a single .js file that works both as a module and as a directly runnable script?
[23:16] yoav_: say you have 10,000 connections per node process, you could just spawn node processes as needed, it'd have to be a huge ddos attack to really have an effect
[23:16] telemachus: Chani: Not sure if you can, but I'm curious: why do you want to? (That is, why *not* put the module in a separate file?)

[23:53] SubStack: aaronblohowiak: is your "base" param relative?

[23:53] level09: Marak:  but i thought node uses only 1 thread
