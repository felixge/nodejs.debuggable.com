[00:40] sammmy: TooTallNate: how do you catch errors that are in a callback?

[02:02] al3xnull has joined the channel
[02:02] chapel: it could be mailerFunction has an error, and is trying to send it
[02:03] chapel: and because you already res.send, it gives you the headers error
[02:03] AI42: <sammmy> but without transactions everything has no sense, i don't belive! it must be some module that can do this

[02:14] totallymike: I rarely serve as much better than a sounding-board, and mostly provide input for my own learning benefit, but I'm always happy to (attempt to) help :)
[02:15] westg: It just seems weird that the error said that it can't set the headers but all i was trying to do was access the req.user object
[02:15] westg: I thought it would only be setting headers for res objects
[02:16] westg: maybe I haven't set up error handling properly

[03:48] sh1mmer: could be a bug
[03:49] daniel`: ok, I’ll divide and conquer it later; thanks

[03:50] baudehlo has joined the channel
[03:50] AvianFlu: if that's what's doing it, I suggest opening a node issue

[03:52] daniel`: no, `process.on("SIGINT", function () {})` exits in 0.6.13
[03:53] sh1mmer: sammmy: you can add breakpoint commands
[03:53] sh1mmer: sammmy: or you can do debug-brk

[03:55] sh1mmer: yes

[03:56] daniel`: yeah, I’m combing through it another time now
[03:56] sammmy: weird. That doesn't seem like valid JS. (it is but it doesn't do anything)
[03:56] sh1mmer: sammmy: however, I would say that you can just run with `node debug-brk script.js`
[03:56] sh1mmer: and then add the require

[04:04] sammmy: sh1mmer: I was talking about the node-inspector tool, just fyi.
[04:05] _numbers: Octayn: have been trying that. even read socket.io protocol. but it looks like it works kind of like php, requiring php to accept connections back on random ports. kind of complex
[04:05] _numbers: although i guess there's nothing wrong with putting express on the node.js app and then just do regular HTTP POST to it

[06:10] simenbrekken has joined the channel
[06:10] benvie: ominous question is ominous
[06:10] benvie: a gig
[06:10] anubhaw has joined the channel
[06:10] benvie: by default anyway, isn't that the max for v8? you can change it
[06:11] benvie: not that you can go multiples higher with 32 bit
[06:12] anubhaw: I tried setting setting --max-old-space-size more than 700mb . node proces fails to start
[06:12] benvie: think you're missing another setting
[06:13] benvie: node --v8-options has all the possibilities, looking to see

[08:30] benvie: server problem. Bind?
[08:30] niftylettuce_: benvie: ? what do u mean 
[08:30] niftylettuce_: is it my ISP?
[08:30] niftylettuce_: my server works ifne.
[08:30] niftylettuce_: fine*
[08:30] benvie: oh
[08:30] niftylettuce_: if i execute dns.resolve4 on my server, its OK, resolved properly
[08:31] benvie: important bit of info 
[08:31] benvie: caching somewhere, local to yuo
[08:31] benvie: and wrong
[08:31] niftylettuce_: if I do it locally, it gives me results of that gist (e.g. function(err, results)) the array of IP's is the results, the err is null, and the "is domain" just validates that req.body.domain is a domain using node-validator
[08:31] niftylettuce_: how can i figure this out?
[08:31] benvie: got a third place to bound stuff of
[08:32] niftylettuce_: what do u mena
[08:32] niftylettuce_: mean
[08:32] niftylettuce_: "bound"? third place?
[08:32] benvie: all the stuff you did locally, do it through a remote server
[08:32] benvie: and see if it'
[08:32] benvie: it matches your or not
[08:32] niftylettuce_: yeah i just told u above it works
[08:32] stagas: niftylettuce_: did you try rebooting? :)

[08:33] benvie: ok nevermind, I'm spent
[08:33] niftylettuce_: stagas: yea i would clear cache, reboot computer AND router, on every time i changed my local DNS settings to either like default, Google, or OpenVNS
[08:33] niftylettuce_: it was working the other day
[08:33] niftylettuce_: and now its not working
[08:33] niftylettuce_: i didnt change one bit of code
[08:33] benvie: another question
[08:33] benvie: can you get it to work locally?
[08:33] benvie: is that the other stuff or no
[08:34] niftylettuce_: ... what?.... i just explained how it wasn't working locally lol
[08:34] niftylettuce_: and it works on server
[08:34] niftylettuce_: ;)
[08:34] benvie: sorry my assumption is the "other stuff" isn't local
[08:34] benvie: local being a kind of relative term
[08:34] niftylettuce_: what are you talking about other stuff
[08:35] niftylettuce_: here is my route for the whois lookup https://gist.github.com/ae8498c19b04bb9c8940
[08:35] niftylettuce_: works fine on server
[08:35] benvie: another server with the same IP: local or not? same rack, same country etc.
[08:35] niftylettuce_: local returns null, [array of ips]
[08:35] niftylettuce_: its obviously a local issue
[08:35] niftylettuce_: somewhere between myself and ISP

I thought TCP can do this job for me...

[15:24] pgte: mattrobenolt: sure
[15:24] aheckmann has joined the channel
[15:24] mattrobenolt: Inside a reply() method, is there a reason why you wouldn't want to supply a callback to build a response based on post vars?
[15:25] rwaldron has joined the channel
[15:25] mattrobenolt: Say I want to mock a post to /users/add or whatever, and return {'new_user': 'Matt'}
[15:25] maritz: is there an express/connect middleware or something like that to handle batched API requests?
[15:25] mattrobenolt: Or whatever, based on what I sent. Kind of the ability to do an echo or something similar.
[15:25] maritz: (I'll ask this until someone gives me a module that does this)
[15:26] pgte: mattrobenolt: you want to reply something dynamic and not just fixtures
[15:26] mattrobenolt: Instead of the response always being a fixed arbitrary response. Maybe even render a simple mustache template based on some data.
[15:26] emattias_ has joined the channel
[15:26] mattrobenolt: pgte: Yeah.
[15:26] pgte: mattrobenolt: sounds good to me :)
[15:26] mattrobenolt: pgte: Ok, wasn't sure if there was a reason you didn't do that in the first place. :)
[15:26] mattrobenolt: I'll fork it and add it today probably.
[15:27] pgte: mattrobenolt: never really felt the need for it, but now that you mention it, it makes sense :)
[15:27] mattrobenolt: Yeah, haha
[15:27] mattrobenolt: It'd allow maybe dynamic fixtures to be loaded in as well. Say mocking a Facebook API or something.
[15:27] mattrobenolt: Maybe even go a step further and allow routes, Express style.
[15:27] mattrobenolt: Err, Connect, I should say.
[15:28] mattrobenolt: .get('/user/:id').reply(function(id){ … })
[15:28] mattrobenolt: If that's a bad idea, feel free to let me know. I'm new to unit testing with mocking http calls, so if I'm missing something, chew me out.
[15:28] infynyxx has joined the channel
[15:28] pgte: mattrobenolt: yeah, I see the usefulness, but maybe the setup would become complex enough that you would need to test it ;)

[15:30] mattrobenolt: pgte: Have you ever seen the Django test client?
[15:30] pgte: mattrobenolt: yes, that sounds like you are implementing a service inside nock. I would want to capture the interaction and make sure the thing I'm testing does A when the remote thing does B.
[15:31] pgte: mattrobenolt: and not the other way around :)
[15:31] mattrobenolt: Right, haha
[15:31] loadTestNode has joined the channel
[15:31] mattrobenolt: Django has a clever test client to use for testing http requests. This might be more of an idea for Express rather than nock. Or maybe some type of union between the two.
[15:31] pgte: mattrobenolt: but the function callback makes sense. I'm not sure about the rounting though
[15:32] pgte: mattrobenolt: s/rounting/routing
[15:32] mattrobenolt: Django integrates with the standard unittest framework in Python and provides a client that makes internal http requests to your own app without running a web server.
[15:32] pgte: mattrobenolt: no, I'm not familiar with Django too much
[15:32] pgte: mattrobenolt: yeah, some testing frameworks in node do that
[15:32] pgte: mattrobenolt: expresso does that AFAIK
[15:32] mattrobenolt: In your tests, you can basically do:  self.client.post('/echo', {'foo': 'bar'}), then test against the response from that.
[15:32] rtgibbons has joined the channel
[15:33] mattrobenolt: Really? Let me check into that.
[15:33] pgte: mattrobenolt: but that's for testing a server, not for testing an HTTP client, which is the use case of nock.
[15:33] mattrobenolt: Now that I think about it, that's not really a nock thing anyways. Nock is intercepting outside http requests. Not internal ones.
[15:33] pgte: mattrobenolt: :)
[15:33] mattrobenolt: Right.
[15:34] mattrobenolt: Good call. Let me fork and add the callback and I'll send a pull request.

[15:54] mattrobenolt: loadTestNode: You're running a command to start Node on the server you're hitting.

[15:55] mattrobenolt: Are you using sudo anywhere in this mix?

[15:56] wink_ has joined the channel
[15:56] mattrobenolt: It's default (again, not sure about RHEL) to 1024.

[15:57] mattrobenolt: No, you can increase the individual limit.
[15:57] loadTestNode: i checked the ulimit...it's set to 1000000

[16:04] AntelopeSalad: in the node source, they seem to stay pretty far away from using object literals for "classes", but in other people's modules they seem to use them a ton -- is this 100% a style preference? maybe the module developers have done more client JS where this format is more common?

[16:11] AntelopeSalad: that is why the prototype pattern is much more common in the node source?

[16:11] mattrobenolt: pgte: It looks like you append the requestBody as part of matching a path?

[16:12] tokumine has joined the channel
[16:12] pgte: yes
[16:12] stagas: AntelopeSalad: it isn't a preference, in case you'd be creating hundreds of objects, then you want them to share the prototype
[16:12] mattrobenolt: pgte: What's the reason for that?
[16:12] Axefield has joined the channel
[16:13] stagas: AntelopeSalad: and also if you'd be inheriting properties etc
[16:13] mattrobenolt: If you're doing that, I guess there isn't a real reason to need to have access to the requestBody from within the callback.
[16:13] pgte: mattrobenolt: to match requests against the respective responses
[16:13] mattrobenolt: You're saying "Only intercept when I pass this specific data."
[16:13] AntelopeSalad: ok i think i see what you mean, thanks
[16:13] mattrobenolt: You know the data being posted.
[16:13] pgte: mattrobenolt: well, right, but you can also change the request body before any matching
[16:14] coderarity: AntelopeSalad: well, if you're only going to have 1 object it's not a big deal if they share methods through the prototype
[16:14] coderarity: like you might not need that
[16:14] mattrobenolt: pgte: How would you do that?
[16:14] pgte: mattrobenolt: by providing a regexp or a callback to .filteringRequestBody I think

[16:15] piscisaureus_ has joined the channel
[16:15] pgte: mattrobenolt: but anyway, you'd still get the chance to reply dynamically

[16:15] mattrobenolt: pgte: Yeah, you're right.
[16:15] hdon: AntelopeSalad: it's necessary for function definitions to be defined within the constructor scope if they want to have access to "private" variables (local variable scope of the constructor function) 1.1 in your link uses this. 1.0 and 1.2 are not semantically different.

[16:18] hdon: coderarity: in languages with formal semantics defining access rules for member variables, it's usually easy to change the access requirements for a member variable (in C++ for instance, you just put public: or protected: (or private:) behind it) but in Javascript it means moving code around a bit more. i think people who design as they go prefer to use public as much as possible to avoid this extra work in case they make design changes that affec

[16:21] AntelopeSalad: use 1.2 if you plan to have multiple instances of the object  , use 2.0 if you plan to use them in a static sense?
[16:21] callumcohen_ has joined the channel
[16:21] coderarity: AntelopeSalad: I didn't like the link you sent about 3 ways to define classes because it classifies them into 3 separate ways when you can really use them all
[16:21] hdon: coderarity: that's still more work than just making it a publicly accessible property of your objects. when i am doing experimental work i make very sure that everything is public. it reads very differently than code i plan on reusing in the future!

[16:25] hdon: stagas: 3 isn't stupid, it's just fulfills a rare set of needs. it's a singleton with private member variables. how else do you propose doing it? (you don't have to use it as a constructor function, but that is a minor difference.)
[16:26] AntelopeSalad: that jquery code example is making my head explode
[16:26] stagas: hdon: with 2
[16:26] hdon: stagas: in fact #3 is quite similar to the way CommonJS modules have been designed. a module is a singleton with its own private scope. it's defined as a function which yields an object with all of its publicly accessible properties and methods.
[16:26] coderarity: AntelopeSalad: javascript functions are classes isn't too bad of an analogy for beginners, but if you really want to understand it, you should read that book

[16:37] hdon: coderarity: see this one: http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1.1 and particularly this part: http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/ScriptModules
[16:37] stagas: AntelopeSalad: somewhat. exports = module.exports internally. so if you do module.exports = { ... }  then 'exports' will point to the old value, not the one we defined now
[16:37] mafiya: Does anyone know how to get the value of <textarea> on a page? using express
[16:38] hdon: coderarity: if the module factory function provides "exports" as an argument to a function, then you can only manipulate the exports object you have been given a reference to, you cannot tell the caller "i want to use a different value for my module's 'exports'"
[16:38] jsurfer has joined the channel
[16:38] AntelopeSalad: stagas: in that, what would be the old value?
[16:38] yawNO: mafiya: name='sm'
[16:38] AntelopeSalad: stagas: in that +sense, what would be the old value?
[16:38] yawNO: then when you submit the form on the controller req.body.sm
[16:38] hdon: AntelopeSalad: the exports object furnished to your module factory function by the CommonJS modules implementation
[16:39] hdon: mafiya: wat
[16:39] AntelopeSalad: and in english that means? lol
[16:39] jocafa: anyone using this? http://projects.jga.me/clientside/
[16:39] stagas: AntelopeSalad: similarly, if you do exports = { ... } then module.exports no longer has the same value as exports
[16:39] hdon: mafiya: if you're submitted a form with a textarea in it, then the name attribute of your textarea will name the HTTP GET or POST parameter you receive on the server when you submit the form
[16:40] stagas: AntelopeSalad: so they're not magic objects, they're simple js variables, and the same rules apply

[16:43] hdon: mafiya: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5710358/how-to-get-post-query-in-express-node-js
[16:43] coderarity: hdon: so if you want to assign something to to exports you have to use module.exports?
[16:44] hdon: coderarity: ok suppose i create my own "module" system. my module system loads modules by injecting a <script> tag to the DOM. (several do just this.) the script loads code that does something like this:
[16:44] dob_: coderarity: This seems to be validation only. :)
[16:44] stagas: AntelopeSalad: it's just less typing than module.exports.foo and node's modules don't export anything else than properties
[16:44] hdon: coderarity: callFunctionToProvideMyModule(exports){exports.foo='bar'}
[16:45] enmand has joined the channel
[16:45] coderarity: dob_: yeah, if you want to also generate forms I would look for another library
[16:45] hdon: coderarity: the variable "exports" is only a local variable. only because it is presumed to be a reference to an object can we actually use the argument to "return" things to the caller.
[16:45] stagas: AntelopeSalad: where in your module you can be exporting just a function so module.exports = function foo () { ... }
[16:45] coderarity: dob_: I'm not sure if someone has done that, you should google it
[16:45] stagas: AntelopeSalad: or whatever
[16:46] hdon: coderarity: but we can only do that by manipulating its properties. we can't say "tell the caller that the variable he used to pass us a reference to an object needs to be assigned a different value"
[16:46] carlyle has joined the channel
[16:46] timoxley has joined the channel
[16:46] coderarity: hdon: yeah, could you just do it like function() { var exports = {}; exports.foo='bar'; return exports; }
[16:47] AntelopeSalad: stagas: but to export just a function you could also write it like this? exports.foo = function() { ... }?
[16:47] coderarity: hdon: then you wouldn't have that problem
[16:47] franciscallo has joined the channel
[16:47] stagas: AntelopeSalad: yes but then you'd be exporting a property/method
[16:47] hdon: coderarity: i am talking about a module system design, however, that does not allow you to return your exports. it must be provided as a parameter to a function. this, again, is just an implementation detail on some javascript platforms when writing a module in C/C++ (or even in other languages)
[16:48] stagas: AntelopeSalad: so you'd need foo = require('foo').foo
[16:48] stagas: AntelopeSalad: where with module.exports = function () {} you'd only use foo = require('foo')
[16:48] hdon: i forget the name of it but there was a lib for Spidermonkey that allowed you to call Python code even :)
[16:48] AntelopeSalad: stagas: yep , or var foo = require('bar'); , then foo.bar()?
[16:48] coderarity: hdon: wait, which language can't return things?
[16:48] maletor has joined the channel
[16:49] AntelopeSalad: stagas: great, that clears it up perfectly
[16:49] hdon: coderarity: *sigh* it is not a language, it was simply an implementation difficulty on some javascript interpreters. it had mostly to do with garbage collection, and know when a module was no longer being used by the program.
[16:49] iliphium has joined the channel
[16:49] stagas: AntelopeSalad: you can imagine require as this: foo = foo's.module.exports
[16:49] coderarity: hdon: dumb implementors
[16:49] coderarity: lol
[16:50] hdon: coderarity: yeah, well spidermonkey is a much older project than v8, so its developer community has had to put in a lot of work to make up for design shortsightedness in the past :)

[19:11] totallymike: gabriel: I doubt this is the best solution, but perhaps you may want to synchronously write it?

[19:12] totallymike: At least at first glance, that's what I'd assume.
[19:12] gabriel: Yeah, and I'm fine with that for this situation.  Would doing it synchronously give me the ability to tell when its done writing everything out to the file though?  Like, nothing's left in the buffer?
[19:13] totallymike: Well it would block until it finished.
[19:13] gabriel: I have to kick off another action once everythiing's been written to the file
[19:13] gabriel: Writing the data isn't my issue, its telling when its completed that is.  Not sure how to figure that

[21:48] edmellum: Leemp: I can't remember who said it, but last NodeUp someone said they'd seen the code for several different large Express sites and none of them looked alike. So I guess there are no real common conventions, which makes sense since Express is so low level and simple.

[21:49] Leemp: Venom_X, edmellum: My issue was mainly that it seems express configuring, routing, etc, all need access to the app object. And i'm.. weird, so i didn't like the idea of "create app, require router, require configure, then app.listen()"
[21:50] Leemp: So, i think i'll just do the same thing, but expose "router.init(app)" functions.

[21:56] dwhittle has joined the channel
[21:56] Leemp: wingie: With that said, you *can* have A require B, and B require A.. depending on what the insides of each look like.. for example, when you define your exports, and when you define your require
[21:56] mansoor has joined the channel
[21:57] Leemp: (I shouldn't use the word define.. i think that is a commonjs or requirejs keyword.. not too familiar with it)
[21:58] kvda has joined the channel
[21:58] Venom_X: hkhalid: the paradigm is different than a traditional game loop. Node runs in a single thread, but has non blocking io. So, through callbacks you can design your game logic without the bounds of a game loop, instead resort to the events being emitted asynchronously.

[22:00] Venom_X: hkhalid: but if you must, you can do timers, and encapsulate game logic in a loop. Although I'd suggest looking into using an eventemitter
[22:00] hh__: what are some good webgl,html5 canvas libraries?
[22:00] mansoor: I too am researching how to go about writing game server on node..
[22:00] Venom_X: hh__: threes is awesome
[22:00] Venom_X: hh__: threejs
[22:01] mansoor: hkhalid, do share what you find :)
[22:01] Venom_X: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/
[22:01] hh__: threes looks cool
[22:02] edmellum: mansoor: What is it that you need to research? I've written a small MMO-like thing without any prep or anything.
[22:02] hh__: is there a good 2d library?

[22:02] Venom_X: I wrote a little fps game with node in the backend a while ago node ~0.4. https://github.com/phillyqueso/fps
[22:02] mansoor: edmellum, really? this is my first game server
[22:03] hkhalid: thanks Vainoharhainen
[22:03] mansoor: kinda scratching where to start
[22:03] hkhalid: Venom_X
[22:03] edmellum: mansoor: Yeah, it was the same for me. What do you feel you need to research?
[22:03] hkhalid: hi mansoor sahab
[22:03] Vainoharhainen: hkhalid: huh?
[22:03] hh__: mansoor: game server or game?
[22:03] hh__: cause there's a difference
[22:03] mansoor: game server
[22:03] daniel__: has anyone tried out zappa?
[22:03] sandfox has joined the channel
[22:03] mansoor: we already started on the front end  https://github.com/mansoor-s/Galactic-Supremacy
[22:04] edmellum: mansoor: Well, what are you making? Online chess, a game with leaderboards and an online sidescroller are all wildly different beasts.
[22:04] mansoor: edmellum, RTS
[22:04] mansoor: with a hint of MMO :)
[22:04] hh__: wouldn't a game server then just be, define an api to 'talk' between game client and server? and that's it
[22:04] edmellum: mansoor: So then you need to be doing all calculations server-side. Your engine will need to be all node.
[22:04] mansoor: edmellum, Its basically an MMO-Empire management. But there is RTS involved
[22:05] mansoor: yah
[22:05] mansoor: i'm not sure how that would scale
[22:05] edmellum: mansoor: It'll have to.
[22:05] mansoor: i mean thats the way to go
[22:05] mansoor: i'm not sure how to structure it so that it will scale
[22:05] mansoor: easily
[22:05] edmellum: mansoor: Or else I can just tell the server I have won the game and I'll have won.
[22:05] mansoor: right I've done my share of  cheat engine hacking :p
[22:06] al3xnull has joined the channel
[22:06] edmellum: mansoor: I sense premature optimization!
[22:06] paulwe has joined the channel
[22:06] sandfox: mansoor: edmellum: ditto
[22:06] edmellum: mansoor: Don't worry about scaling, worry about getting the scaling problem. That is making a thing people want.
[22:06] sandfox: just worry about your game design first
[22:07] mansoor: edmellum, wel... there are 1 milion stars in my galaxy. when it comes to a battle. that makes the server having to manage all of those star systems as a "room"
[22:07] mansoor:  hmm
[22:07] edmellum: mansoor: Well if it doesn't run well it doesn't run well.
[22:07] hkhalid: mansoor you got your game loops down and all
[22:07] hkhalid: i think not having a game loop
[22:07] hkhalid: i makes html5 games hard to make
[22:07] edmellum: mansoor: Then you'll make it run properly.
[22:08] mansoor: hkhalid, a loop is the only way to go
[22:08] edmellum: mansoor: Since it's real-time you'll need a traditional game-loop. Just a good ol setInterval.
[22:08] hkhalid: but how come I cant do it in js
[22:08] hkhalid: i hate setinterval
[22:09] mansoor: edmellum, eye thats what i've been thinking
[22:09] edmellum: mansoor: Save game state in memory or file to begin with.
[22:09] sandfox: how about using ticks?
[22:09] mansoor: *aye
[22:09] edmellum: mansoor: Update clients with Socket.IO.
[22:09] mansoor: I've been wondering to use websockets or UDP
[22:10] mansoor: I'm looking into using embeded chromuim or embeded gecko and giving it UDP support
[22:10] sandfox: mansoor: socket.io for the win
[22:10] edmellum: mansoor: Just use Socket.IO and limit it to websockets.
[22:10] mansoor: sandfox, dont' need socket.io
[22:10] mansoor: its only good for lots of fallback
[22:10] sandfox: mansoor: it'll mean more time spent on your game and less time re-inventing stuff
[22:10] mansoor: i dont' need fallback. If the client supports webgl it definatly supports websockets
[22:10] joshfinnie has joined the channel
[22:10] edmellum: mansoor: Again, this is premature optimization. Don't think about UDP.
[22:10] sandfox: mansoor: you can optimise later
[22:11] edmellum: mansoor: Use Socket.IO or Websocket.IO if you must.
[22:11] Venom_X: websockets are over tcp
[22:12] mansoor: whats wrong with regular websockets?
[22:12] mansoor: api is nice enough
[22:12] mansoor: I already have the serverside down
[22:12] edmellum: mansoor: Then you'll need to reinvents rooms and channels.
[22:13] sandfox: mansoor: just aim to get MVP as soon as possible, don't let side tasks get in the way
[22:13] jaha: having a problem writing to file in ubuntu, what am i missing? i get Error: ENOENT, open "myfile", stream not writable
[22:13] mansoor: edmellum, socket.io has a concept of rooms?
[22:13] joshontheweb has joined the channel
[22:14] mansoor: sandfox, wise words :)
[22:15] edmellum: mansoor: Yeah, it also has a lot of really useful stuff that you'll probably want later. Just go with it, stop tinkering and think about the actual game part.

[22:23] qbert_: wingie,  probably a recompile
[22:23] warz has joined the channel
[22:23] edmellum: Long stacktraces seems to have been talked about a lot, but hasn't been done yet since it has performance penalties.
[22:23] qbert_: wingie, maybe search how to turn it on in V8
[22:24] qbert_: just found this https://github.com/tlrobinson/long-stack-traces
[22:24] edmellum: shanebo: You can totally create your own stream. fs.ReadStream is specifically for reading files.
[22:25] edmellum: shanebo: Or did you misunderstand the question?
[22:25] dshaw_ has joined the channel
[22:25] jergason has joined the channel
[22:25] shanebo: edmellum what I want to stream is not from a file, but a buffer cached in memory

[22:27] edmellum: shanebo: Well then it sounds like you want to make your own stream. Check out the streams docs: http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html

[22:31] disappearedng: let say I have a class, Engine which imports from a config class that has all the variables. Now I am doing testing and I want to change those variables. Is there a way I can change a particular variable in a particular namespace? 
[22:31] edmellum: shanebo: Make a stream and pipe it into a response. A good example of a stream, though maybe a bit complicated is fs.ReadStream: https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/fs.js#L1100
[22:33] mehlah has joined the channel
[22:33] robi42 has joined the channel
[22:33] shanebo: edmellum yeah but notice the "path" argument. There is no path when it's in memory.
[22:34] edmellum: shanebo: I'm not saying use ReadStream. I'm saying ReadStream is a stream, you need to make your own, but looking at ReadStream can help you understand how to make your own.
[22:34] relling has joined the channel
[22:35] edmellum: shanebo: On 1161 ReadStream is extended with Stream. Just like you would with an eventemitter.

[22:37] jsurfer_ has joined the channel
[22:37] shanebo: edmellum i wonder if request would be a good example https://github.com/mikeal/request
[22:38] edmellum: shanebo: Sure would! Basically everything async in Node has callback API and a Stream API. A lot of third-party modules do too.
[22:38] edmellum: shanebo: Mikeal seems obsessed with streams so his modules are definitely a good place to look.
[22:39] shanebo: edmellum still looks like this api is only for things in the file system. I already have the headers and buffer in memory...
[22:39] ericmuyser has joined the channel
[22:39] maxogden: its not that mikeal is obsessed with streams... the whole point of using node is to get the stream api
[22:39] maxogden: but felix has more stream examples if thats what you're looking for
[22:40] shanebo: maxogden, I've been banging my head on this for a while. Can you point me in the right directions? I have my headers and body buffer in memory and I've read dumping the buffer in response.end is bad practice. So I'm looking for how to stream the response. Any ideas?
[22:40] alexrbarlow has joined the channel
[22:41] maxogden: shanebo: can you post your code?
[22:41] wingie: ok this is weird .. i have a packageA that has packageB as dependency .. and vice versa ... when I do "npm install" from packageB it doesn't install packageA from the npm repo since it's installed in packageA .. the problem is that it cant require A
[22:41] wingie: any idea?
[22:41] spasquali has left the channel
[22:41] shanebo: maxogden yeah give me a few and I can give an example
[22:41] isaacs: wingie: that's sort of a known edge-case.
[22:42] wingie: isaacs: how could i solve it?
[22:42] isaacs: wingie: if you were to install packageA in some *other* package, it would, because they'd be in a node_modules folder
[22:42] wingie: yeah
[22:42] isaacs: wingie: cd ~/path/to/projects; cd ..; ln -s projects node_modules
[22:42] wingie: i renamed packageA's name to packageC in package.json and when running "npm install" now installed packageB along with packageA from npm registry 
[22:43] isaacs: wingie: i just develop in a node_modules folder.
[22:43] isaacs: wingie: then everything finds everything
[22:43] isaacs: it's actually really nice.
[22:44] wingie: isaacs: but those are already ready to be used .. no need for further development
[22:44] wingie: isaacs: i want A to use B and vice versa now
[22:44] isaacs: wingie: you're in ~/src/packagea/, right?
[22:45] isaacs: wingie: and you do `npm link ../packageb` or some such
[22:45] isaacs: wingie: and the problem is that it doesn't put anything at ~/src/packagea/node_modules/packageb/node_modules/packagea
[22:45] isaacs: because it's already in teh ancestry
[22:45] wingie: no i published both packages
[22:46] wingie: then in A I do npm install 
[22:46] wingie: it installs B but B doesn't install A since its installed from A
[22:46] patcito has joined the channel
[22:46] wingie: isaacs: yeah thats correct
[22:46] wingie: isaacs: but the issue here is that B _cant_ find A when it require('a')
[22:47] wingie: something it should since it was skipping to install it i thought
[22:48] jacoblyles has joined the channel
[22:48] isaacs: wingie: right, so, do this:
[22:48] isaacs: cd ~; ln -s src node_modules
[22:49] CarterL has joined the channel
[22:49] isaacs: wingie: then it will find it when it does require('a')

[22:50] wingie: since if people git clone my project and run "npm test" it will fail if they don't do ln -s

[22:50] jakehow has joined the channel
[22:51] isaacs: wingie: you can go ahead and post an issue.  but it's kind of a rare edge case.

[23:16] kbhit has joined the channel
[23:16] maxogden: shanebo: ok so streams are only for data that isnt already in memory
[23:16] maxogden: shanebo: and buffers are big chunks of memory
[23:17] maxogden: shanebo: so once you have something in a buffer you can just write it out. streams are for things that are slow like network and disk
[23:17] shanebo: maxogden, so how I'm handling it is fine?
[23:18] maxogden: shanebo: yep but ideally you would want to .pipe whatever is reading the cached asset into the response
[23:18] maxogden: shanebo: instead of waiting for it to finish buffering and then writing it out
[23:18] shanebo: maxogden okay how do I do that?

[23:45] spolu_ has joined the channel
[23:45] isaacs: wingie: yeah, just link em
[23:45] isaacs: wingie: if you have that many, maybe you're breaking things up inappropriately.
