[00:02] avex: i tried it earlier, but it has a 500 error
[00:02] avex: great error page!
[00:02] micheil: hmm..
[00:02] micheil: I'll mention it to the developer when I see him tomorrow.

[00:20] maxogden: b52: i would recommend using a package.json to manage your dependencies
[00:20] mAritz: b52: npm update
[00:21] Lingerance: sean___: Usually that means you don't have g++ or a C++ compiler.
[00:21] b52: i simply want to update a package but "npm update <pkg>" doesnt do the trick
[00:21] dreamdu5t: You may have installed it globally, in which case you might need to do npm update -g <pkg>
[00:21] ryanrolds: sean___: What OS?

[00:47] darshanshankar: daneroo: we're about to write a blog post about how to run nowjs (which uses socket.io) on cloudfoundry. I imagine you can follow some of the same steps to get dnode running on cloudfoundry

[01:55] fxspark: I do have two tmp directories.. one at /tmp and other at /root/tmp
[01:56] dominictarr: fxspark: are you experiences at JS or are you just new to node and stuff?

[01:56] jesusabdullah: Aikar: You might be able to do that with hook.io already
[01:56] jesusabdullah: and then make some sort of notification hook
[01:56] Aikar: jesusabdullah: lol, i meant as a way to alert people who npm update your module of breaking changes
[01:56] jesusabdullah: Ah

[01:57] dominictarr: okay cool, cos I think you are gonna have to dive into npm and log the command it's trying to run
[01:58] dominictarr: then see if you can run it manually
[01:58] dominictarr: npm ERR! tar -cvf - <file list elided> execvp(): No such file or directory
[01:58] jesusabdullah: Oh, I see what you mean
[01:58] dominictarr: need to know what that if meant to be.
[01:58] Aikar: v8 seems really random on performance... sometimes my benchmark can run faster than the time before. keep making tiny tweaks trying to see how they impact but the performance isnt constant :(
[01:58] jesusabdullah: You could make it an included script
[01:58] Aikar: yeah but how would you know their previous version?
[01:58] d0k has joined the channel
[01:59] fxspark: what does <file list elided> mean?
[01:59] jesusabdullah: Aikar: Before you install it scan the old package.json with your script
[01:59] jesusabdullah: fxspark: Sounds like somebody saying, "insert a big list of files here"
[01:59] dominictarr: I think it's removing the details of your computer from the log, since that is private.
[01:59] Aikar: jesusabdullah: lol sounds doable but seems like it would be a neat npm feature
[02:00] fxspark: oh ok.. makes sense
[02:00] jesusabdullah: Yeah, totes. Hey, maybe you can get it integrated into npm afterwards
[02:00] jesusabdullah: fxspark: Yeah, elided means baleeted
[02:00] jesusabdullah: http://definefor.me/elide/
[02:00] Aikar: upgradeNotices: { "2.x:3.x": "Do this for upgrade from 2 to 3", "1.x:3.x": "do this for 1 to 3"}
[02:01] jesusabdullah: I think "changelog" would make more sense

[02:02] fxspark: and thanks dominictarr 
[02:02] Aikar: print in red "your code is now broke, do this to fix it" is gonna let them know immmed
[02:02] jesusabdullah: I know you are
[02:02] jesusabdullah: so, you have a preinstall script
[02:02] fxspark: I guess I'll wait for isaacs to respond
[02:02] jesusabdullah: which you can do with npm
[02:03] jesusabdullah: that scans the current package.json and the original package.json, and checks the "changelog" field of the latest one
[02:03] jesusabdullah: and then echoes all of the relevant changelogs
[02:03] dominictarr: fxspark: it will be pretty simple to the bit that is eliding and turn it off
[02:03] jesusabdullah: and then installs the package
[02:03] dominictarr: grep elid ./npm
[02:04] dominictarr: you will need to clone isaacs/npm
[02:04] jesusabdullah: Oh, Aikar, you can mitigate that problem by using major.breaking.x versions only
[02:04] dominictarr: grep elid ./npm -r
[02:04] jesusabdullah: ie, "dependencies": { "myPackage": "v1.2.x" }
[02:05] fxspark: dominictarr:  what does that command do? sorry, pretty new to linux.. hence my troubles
[02:05] dominictarr: grep searchs for a string in files
[02:06] dominictarr: it will return you all the files with the string elid

[03:55] abiii: jesusabdullah: i like writing shell scripts in node. i'd really like to have long list of sequential commands and not deal with callbacks
[03:55] abiii: i think it's a perfectly valid use case actually
[03:55] abiii: that's part of the reason why all the fs/path functions generally have Sync counterparts
[03:58] jesusabdullah: but these programs have a streaming interface themselves

[04:00] innociv: Damn it.  Trying to track how many people are in room without patching socket.io is giving me problems. ;/  http://pastebin.com/LLjzER5Y Channel.leave is getting called multiple times and putting it into negative numbers.  I suppose because both socket.on('disconnect', function () { Channel.leave(socket); }); is being called and socket.on('boardunsub', function(name){ Channel.leave(socket); });  
[04:00] T0aD: is there any way to get the former function parameter in the callback ?
[04:00] innociv: ;/  I guess I can do an extend on socket.io functions?..
[04:01] innociv: I'm weary of directly editing the socket.io javascript.
[04:01] abiii: jesusabdullah: yeah, i can buffer. but i'd rather write a();b(); rather than a(function(){b();});

[04:03] bnoordhuis: abiii: there's probably going to be a sync spawn in 0.6
[04:03] T0aD: well for fs.stat() that would be the filename with relative path
[04:03] abiii: bnoordhuis: awesome! know any npm modules that already support it? or patches?
[04:04] T0aD: like : fs.stat(filename, function(err, res) { // how to get filename value back here ? });
[04:04] bnoordhuis: abiii: sorry, no
[04:08] julioj: T0aD: if your call to fs.stat is in the same closure as where you define the filename it should be able to access it from within the callback.  Is what I'm thinking.
[04:09] T0aD: i can try to define the filename just before to see
[04:10] T0aD: but wouldnt it be the last name all the time ?

[04:12] abiii: bnoordhuis: hmm, guess i'll just write one then. should be as simple as fork/waiting right?
[04:13] bnoordhuis: abiii: yes
[04:15] matyr has joined the channel
[04:15] jesusabdullah: abiii: You might be able to write it concisely by using program1.stdout.pipe(program2.stdin)
[04:15] julioj: T0aD: I think if your code pattern is set up right (aynchronous-wise) you should be fine with setting the filename just before the fs.stat().
[04:15] jesusabdullah: a bunch
[04:16] T0aD: nope doesnt work but im reading some code where it should work calling another function and passing my filename as a parameter

[06:05] AvianFlu: node.js ftw
[06:05] halfhalo: silly internet!
[06:05] mjr_: Anyway creationix, I hope you can get some useful insight into how to make node faster from this research.
[06:05] creationix: mjr_: yeah, I'm trying to remove v8 from the equation and see just how fast node's architecture is
[06:06] dash: i wonder what ever happened to spidernode
[06:06] creationix: mjr_: also lua adds the ability to do true fibers and threads in a way that makes sense
[06:06] mAritz: I'm looking for a node.js project. Preferable small open source projects that are desperate for more people and are game related. PM me! :)
[06:06] creationix: in case we want to experiement with slightly modified node architectures
[06:06] mjr_: surely fibers doesn't actually make anything faster.
[06:06] dash: creationix: is that a drawback or a benefit? :)
[06:06] mjr_: Not 2X faster.
[06:07] creationix: and I'm not using fibers or threads in my benchmark
[06:07] mjr_: dash: it never actually worked right.  it's a great idea though, IMO, and I hope Mozilla finishes it.

[06:07] mjr_: brb, for some reason we bought bunnies, and I must go play with them.
[06:07] AvianFlu: I hope fibers don't make things faster XD
[06:07] dash: mjr_: yeah. it'd be nice to use gpsee and node together :)
[06:07] creationix: AvianFlu: no, if anything they will slow stuff down
[06:07] creationix: having multiple execution stacks
[06:08] AvianFlu: I'd figure
[06:08] creationix: but the threads are nice
[06:08] creationix: they share nothing just like node processes in cluster
[06:08] m1k3l has joined the channel
[06:08] dash: creationix: that doesn't sound much like threads then :)
[06:08] dash: sounds more like erlang processe
[06:08] dash: s
[06:09] creationix: I'm pretty sure they are actual pthreads
[06:09] creationix: or something like that
[06:09] creationix: multi-core ftw, but no sharing
[06:09] creationix: shared multi-core is nasty stuff
[06:09] AvianFlu: I seem to remember reading that your average *nix can handle more processes at once than it can threads
[06:09] creationix: that could be, but I don't plan on having a high number of either
[06:10] dash: yeah there needs to be a good term for "shares nothing at the language level but implemented with threads and limited sharing/message passing in the native-code runtime"
[06:10] creationix: just a thread/process per core
[06:10] dash: because "threads" and "processes" both suggest things different from that :)
[06:10] creationix: lua is a strange language
[06:11] creationix: but the C bindings are really fun

[08:15] andrewthemerry: does setting uploadDir = process.env.TMP write to ram instead of disk?

[08:16] chjj: andrewthemerry: no
[08:16] jetienne: tmp = /tmp usually
[08:16] chjj: andrewthemerry: i dont think formidable would ever hold files in memory, that would be pretty nuts
[08:16] jetienne: you can mount a ram disk tho and set TMP
[08:17] DrMcKay_: not a ramdisk, tmpfs
[08:17] onethirtyfive has joined the channel
[08:17] DrMcKay_: (you would have to mkfs on a ramdisk, tmpfs handles that)
[08:17] jetienne: isnt that a ram disk ?
[08:17] andrewthemerry: yikes
[08:17] DrMcKay_: jetienne: ram disk is just a block device, tmpfs is a file system
[08:18] jetienne: DrMcKay_: ok so is tmpfs a ram disk ?
[08:18] zomgbie has joined the channel
[08:18] DrMcKay_: jetienne: tmpfs is like a ramdisk formatted, it's stored in ram and has a file system
[08:18] jetienne: DrMcKay_: ok
[08:19] DrMcKay_: and ramdisk by itself has no file system
[08:19] kenperkins: http://www.clipboard.com/clip/LR0qOLfpAllnd16K

[08:19] andrewfff has joined the channel
[08:20] kenperkins: anyone on nodejitsu btw
[08:20] andrewthemerry: DrMcKay_: so trying to write to ram instead of disk is probably a black hole of time
[08:21] kenperkins: what, pray tell, are you ever writing to your store
[08:21] kenperkins: even rather
[08:21] jetienne: andrewthemerry: considere that on linux if you
[08:22] andrewthemerry: kenperkins: i'm using formidable to handle file uploads, but I realized it writes the file to /tmp, and I'd rather it go straight to a non-local db
[08:22] jetienne: andrewthemerry: additionnalty the kernel is caching disk operation. So if the file remains only a small amount of time on the filesystem, it may never reach the dsisk
[08:22] andrewthemerry: kenperkins: but i'm really green and this is a huge problem for me
[08:23] andrewthemerry: jetienne: aaah see i was wondering how necessary that write to /tmp was
[08:24] jetienne: andrewthemerry: my personnal policy is to optimize only when you got perf problem. "prematture optimisation is the root of all evils" - knuth i like this sentence

[08:59] rmzg: andrewthemerry: Merely by virtue of being 'uploaded' it's already in ram
[08:59] rmzg: Look
[09:00] rmzg: His computer opens a socket to your server. It transmits the file data. Your server opens the socket and reads the file data. Your library then copies this file data to a file and then sends you the filename
[09:03] andrewthemerry: rmzg: i don't really see that happening.  i'm really green
[09:04] andrewthemerry: rmzg: also getting late for me, not trying to be difficult
[09:05] andrewthemerry: rmzg: basically I don't see how the file is stored without a path

[09:16] rmzg: Ok, yes

[10:58] chjj: it follows standards though :)

[10:59] xerox: (doesn't)
[11:00] xerox: but at least some examples :x
[11:00] chjj: dont need examples, it uses tab atkins editor's drafts for the syntax

[11:01] chjj: nested rules*
[11:01] Nuck: Yeah you need examples
[11:01] Nuck: Or at least a link thereto
[11:01] chjj: go read the spec, youre going to have to in a little while anyway
[11:01] chjj: once it becomes a standard
[11:01] xerox: ok let's say
[11:01] Nuck: No I'll just study *examples*
[11:01] xerox: at least a link to the thing you're mentioning
[11:02] Nuck: I don't read specs

[11:02] Nuck: Naught
[11:03] chjj: http://www.xanthir.com/blog/b4Av0
[11:03] xerox: there in the README :)
[11:03] chjj: the rest are on tab's blog as well
[11:03] Nuck: [[Standard disclaimer - this is a personal draft, and is not endorsed by the CSSWG.]]
[11:03] chjj: not yet
[11:03] Nuck: …
[11:03] xerox: go to sleep
[11:03] chjj: but if you actually read the www-style mailing list you might have a better sense of whats going on
[11:03] Nuck: So there's technically no standard
[11:04] chjj: this is how standards are proposed
[11:04] chjj: tab is helming this, it will most likely become a standard, if there is ever to be variables, mixins, nested rules, etc - this is the one to follow
[11:05] chjj: thats why i wrote my css preprocessor, because i wanted one that was more in line with css
[11:06] Nuck: chjj: Meh I'll prolly stick to Stylus simply because the transparent mixins and a few other things 
[11:06] openpercept has joined the channel
[11:07] chjj: thats fine, i didnt expect you to use it

[11:07] chjj: i was more serious about it when i wrote it than you think though
[11:07] Nuck: chjj: I do find it interesting though
[11:07] chjj: i hope it never becomes that way, its a declarative language

[11:07] megalomix: guys, how can i use TLS 1.2 ? i read that TLS 1.0 is buggy
[11:07] megalomix: i need to use that certificate for my website with node
[11:08] Nuck: chjj: Aye but it's working on what is generally a ton of objects, as in the DOM
[11:08] chjj: youre looking at it the wrong way if you think that, the DOM is incredibly divorced from css
[11:08] Nuck: so it should reflect the logical objectical structure
[11:08] chjj: css was created to work on any kind of tree structure, its not necessarily for the dom
[11:09] chjj: in fact, the css specs dont even mention html/dom or anything, they simply say, "the host language"
[11:09] Nuck: chjj: Who cares what it works on, nothing else uses it :V
[11:09] chjj: the dom is at fault here, not css
[11:09] chjj: the dom is *unbelievably* divorced from css
[11:10] Nuck: I want the OOCSS concepts taken and applied to a CSS preprocessor
[11:10] chjj: the css view module was a salvaging of all the proprietary dom properties created by microsoft in the 90s, its awful, the dom needs to change, not css
[11:11] Nuck: chjj: CSS is more likely to change than dom is
[11:11] chjj: likely to change in certain ways
[11:11] chjj: remains to be seen whether it will change in the way youre referring to
[11:11] Nuck: I believe that OOCSS is what CSS *should* have been
[11:11] chjj: i hope it doesnt, that would be a gigantic step in the wrong direction

[12:04] TheJH: Tiller, maybe you should wait for `3rdEden to come online (unfortunately, I don't know his timezone)
[12:04] DrMcKay: I think it's GMT+01 or +02
[12:05] DrMcKay: Tiller: it doesn't work
[12:05] DrMcKay: Tiller: FF 6 had some problems with implementing hybi07 or hybi10
[12:05] DrMcKay: Tiller: you should be able to get it working with Chrome 15
[12:06] TheJH: DrMcKay, shouldn't the fallback mechanisms always work?
[12:06] reid has joined the channel
[12:06] Tiller: So it's socket.io related ?
[12:06] DrMcKay: TheJH: the problem is that FF seems to report/act like it implements it fully
[12:07] DrMcKay: (I think, FF codebase is full of shit)
[12:07] DrMcKay: (and I mean, really)
[12:08] TheJH: Tiller, I think it's the fault of Firefox because it says that it can do stuff that it can't do as well as the fault of socket.io because it runs head-first in the same wall again and again
[12:08] Tiller: DrMcKay: What do you advise me? To continue my project like if that bug doesn't exists, or to search a fix?

[12:09] DrMcKay: Tiller: socket.io works in FF 8.0, so it should work in FF 6.0 soon

[12:09] DrMcKay: Tiller: it's fine when it works in Chrome 15
[12:10] Tiller: Well, I'll update my chrome so. Because I've v13, and socket.io is not working :[
[12:10] TheJH: DrMcKay, we need a "sane-retry" lib :D - it should support fail after x tries, exponential/linear backoff, warning callback, ...
[12:13] Tiller: Oh sh*t~ Lastest chrome stable version is 14
[12:13] Tiller: and socket.io doesn't work with v14
[12:13] DrMcKay: Tiller: try 15, it's really stable
[12:14] DrMcKay: and yes, I know it's called unstable.

Which one is better?  I'm thinking process.nextTick, anyone have a different opinion.

[14:09] samstarling: Works fine if I sudo it, but that's not really an option as I'm deploying it to Heroku (so it gets the same error there)
[14:09] Brandon_R: wouldn't it be better to put it outside and just have the query variable inside the create server function?

[14:09] DrMcKay: samstarling: on Unix systems only root can open ports < 1024

[14:10] DrMcKay: samstarling: use some reverse proxy, like nginx

[14:10] DrMcKay: ruchir: and yes, persistent connection is a must here
[14:10] Brandon_R: i will have to benchmark it
[14:10] Brandon_R: oh
[14:10] samstarling: So no way to get it to run on port 80 on Heroku I guess?
[14:10] DrMcKay: samstarling: no, why not?
[14:11] Brandon_R: start db connection when entire app starts, query db for each client and close db when entire app closes?
[14:11] Brandon_R: is that better?
[14:11] DrMcKay: samstarling: I haven't tried heroku yet, but there should be a way to get it going
[14:12] samstarling: DrMcKay: OK, thanks
[14:12] DrMcKay: samstarling: (also, on Heroku, isn't your account root by default?)
[14:12] ruchir: so moving closee and open code outside create server?

[14:32] TheJH: jmar777, I don't think that's possible, but you can install crawler and then go into node_modules/crawler and do npm install quinit@0.2.5, I think

[15:06] broofa: require.paths question:  My app auto-requires modules it finds in a 'plugins' directory.  How do I make modules in the app available to the plugin modules?  (e.g. the app has a './commands' module.  How would a plugin require that, since it's in a different directory and that path won't work.  Keeping in mind that require.paths is deprecated.)
[15:07] broofa: ... I'd like to avoid forcing the plugins do use contorted relative paths like, '../../lib/commands'. :P

[15:58] apejens: mraleph: yeah, and I can't exactly reproduce it conclusivly, so it might be another 2 weeks for a backtrace :p
[15:58] apejens: mraleph: anything I can enable to make the trace more useful next time? since I'm compiling a new node
[15:59] apejens: debug I presume will help?
[15:59] mraleph: apejens: debug will make it more "readable" and debuggable but it might not necessary help :-)

[16:03] nickf: i've got all the libraries and the howtonode.org code, but i don't know how to launch it
[16:04] chance-: have you installed node?
[16:04] apejens: nickf: do you have more than one js-file?
[16:04] apejens: nickf: if not, chances are "node <yourfile>" might work, given you have node installed
[16:04] nickf: yep i have node
[16:04] ryanrolds has joined the channel
[16:05] nickf: and i've cloned howtonode.org and installed the deps with "npm install"
[16:05] nickf: but then, no idea.
[16:05] nickf: i also installed wheat globally (npm install wheat -g)
[16:05] chance-: nickf : in the root of the folder there should be at least 1 js file
[16:05] chance-: probably something called like app.js or server.js
[16:06] chance-: i havent seen wheat or what you're talking about
[16:06] nickf: 1 sec, i'll get the links to their repos
[16:06] chance-: but you'll want to run the command "node app.js" or whatever file is in the root directory (server, app, whatever)
[16:06] nickf: Wheat: https://github.com/creationix/wheat/
[16:06] apejens: node server/server.js might be it
[16:07] apejens: if it is the howtonode-thing you are trying to run
[16:07] nickf: howtonode: https://github.com/creationix/howtonode.org
[16:07] nickf: ah yes i see the server/server.js now
[16:08] apejens: mraleph: ok, deployed a patched version, we'll see how it goes :)
[16:08] mraleph: apejens: great
[16:09] nickf: i've run "node server/server.js" and now http://localhost:8080/ comes back with "Not Found", but it looks like it's actually being served by node
[16:09] mraleph: apejens: btw, just do check, did you do a clean rebuild? 
[16:09] mraleph: apejens: sometimes it just ignore updates and does not rebuild
[16:09] apejens: mraleph: make distclean, ./configure, make, make test, make install

[16:13] chance-: :/
[16:13] DrMcKay: I want to display them in a template

[16:16] nickf: could anyone explain what this variable is?"process.env.JOYENT"

[16:18] chance-:     messages: require('express-messages'),
[16:18] chance-: messages()
[16:18] chance-: in the view
[16:18] chance-: should do it
[16:18] chance-: er
[16:18] DrMcKay: chance-: thanks :)
[16:18] chance-: DrMcKay if you are using express, i believe     messages: require('express-messages') in your app.js or wherever you are defining your settings
[16:19] chance-: and then messages() in the view
[16:19] chance-: that's how mine is setup and it works

[17:29] TheJH: PuffTheMagic, a "term app"?

[17:31] tjholowaychuk: Nuck you can do that
[17:31] tjholowaychuk: it supports both
[17:32] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: Yes, but the tmbundle doesn't insert the ; for me :P
[17:32] tjholowaychuk: hahaha
[17:32] Nuck: And that, my friend, is a dealbreaker.
[17:32] tjholowaychuk: nice reason

[17:34] Brandon_R: what
[17:34] Brandon_R: s up guys
[17:34] chance-: is stylus basically saas?
[17:34] tjholowaychuk: nope
[17:34] g4: has anyone some experience with mongodb from node.js and can recommend a library to use? Is mongoose the best one or should I look somewhere else? 
[17:34] chance-: is stylus to sass what jade is to haml?
[17:34] chance-: g4 yea, mongoose is pretty easy to get rolling with
[17:34] tjholowaychuk: stylus supports traditional css syntax and the sass-ish indentation syntax
[17:35] tjholowaychuk: and a lot of things sass does not support
[17:35] chance-: hmph, i never bothered around w/ sass
[17:35] chance-: if it supports traditional css syntax, i may go ahead
[17:35] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: I dig the transparent stuff in Stylus, but it's kinda hard when the syntax for a variable is rather hard to make highlight
[17:35] chance-: and check it out*
[17:35] tjholowaychuk: Nuck $foo
[17:35] tjholowaychuk: you can prefix if you like
[17:35] tjholowaychuk: but you dont have to
[17:36] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: Does the tmBundle handle $vars right?
[17:36] tjholowaychuk: not sure if it does right now, no reason it couldnt though
[17:36] tjholowaychuk: trivial thing to add
[17:37] g4: chance-: ok, thanks :) 
[17:37] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: I might steal the :-; matching from LESS and roll some stuff I want in
[17:37] Nuck: LESS is great on a small scale, but nested rules suck for object-oriented CSS
[17:38] chance-: g4 : if you are new to mongodb in general, http://www.mongly.com/ is a great resource
[17:38] PuffTheMagic: TheJH, thanks for the tips, that def fixed one of my issues
[17:38] chance-: it's interactive tutorial is fun, pretty easy to get the basics down
[17:38] tjholowaychuk: LESS doesn't really do enough to warrant using a preprocessor
[17:39] tjholowaychuk: css alone is less ugly

[17:39] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: I dig the style, I'll give it that.  But the .rounded-corners is kinda... meh
[17:39] Nuck: I like the transparent mixins you have in Stylus
[17:39] tjholowaychuk: sass/stylus > less
[17:39] tjholowaychuk: in almost every way
[17:40] Nuck: I already did my CSS in LESS, but it's not hard to change, seeing as LESS compiles quite wonderfully
[17:40] tjholowaychuk: less has the one benefit of being small enough to use in the browser with ease
[17:40] tjholowaychuk: that's about it
[17:40] g4: chance-: thanks! I find mongo pretty easy to grasp, but I will look through that site. 
[17:41] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: I personally prefer the CSS-style syntax, and the nested concept seemed alright at first, but it's just prohibitive for an OOCSS setup
[17:41] g4: also impressed by speed. Only issue I have some trouble with is the async nature of node.js. Not used to do nested async operations
[17:41] Nuck: I'm honestly fine with the @ for variables

[17:42] ShonM: ACTION is a noob :)
[17:42] g4: e.g. request->callback->mongosave->callback. I guess there are some libraries to help me out in node.js, but not looked at them yet
[17:42] jondot has joined the channel
[17:42] Nuck: ShonM: Package dependencies?  Why not just use package.json and use npm install?
[17:43] jondot: hey guy, i'm trying to understand how setTimeout works in node.js in terms of threads - if node is single threaded, how does that happen in the background?
[17:43] ShonM: Nuck: let's say i don't have access to npm
[17:44] Nuck: ShonM: Well, for compiled modules it'll be hell, but for JS modules, just use the node_modules folder
[17:44] Nuck: I highly recommend using npm to install the modules originally
[17:44] aho has joined the channel
[17:44] ShonM: thanks Nuck, i'll do that. didn't want to blow up my repo but hey :P
[17:44] chance-: hmm, stylus does look interesting..
[17:44] Nuck: ShonM: Well, most people should have NPM >_>
[17:45] Nuck: Because, well, it's NPM.
[17:45] chance-: not sure it'd save me a lot fo time though
[17:45] Nuck: Anyone who has it is sad
[17:45] chance-: Nuck : unless they are on windows
[17:45] dshaw_ has joined the channel
[17:45] Nuck: chance-: Stylus looks interesting because of the transparent mixins to me
[17:45] ShonM: Nuck: i do have it, but i'm deploying to more than 10 locations and don't want to use npm in all of them, and also don't want to symlink. if that makes any sense
[17:45] tjholowaychuk: chance- you save time when background: linear-gradient(...) expands to all the vendor variants and a node-canvas generated gradient image :)
[17:45] tjholowaychuk: and several other little things
[17:45] chance-: Nuck : yea, just watched a video and he covered that
[17:46] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: How do you mixin with linear-gradient D:
[17:46] chance-: i'm just not crazy about the syntax
[17:46] Nuck: That's a rough one
[17:46] tjholowaychuk: ex: "absolute: top 5px left 10px"
[17:46] tjholowaychuk: vs 3 props
[17:46] tjholowaychuk: Nuck ?
[17:46] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: There's like 12 syntaxes for that
[17:46] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[17:46] Nuck: All *completey* different
[17:46] tjholowaychuk: Nuck: https://github.com/visionmedia/nib/blob/master/lib/nib/gradients.styl
[17:46] ShonM: Nuck: is there a way i could slim down my node_modules folder…?
[17:46] tjholowaychuk: all in-stylus
[17:47] Nuck: ShonM: AFAIK, not really, there's a reason most people just use npm

[17:49] tjholowaychuk: just a lot younger
[17:50] chance-: can you add ; to the end?
[17:50] chance-: or are you forced to use their syntax?
[17:50] tjholowaychuk: yup
[17:50] tjholowaychuk: no you can use css
[17:50] tjholowaychuk: i'll find an example

[17:51] tjholowaychuk: if desired
[17:52] chance-: word, i'll give it a try
[17:52] chance-: thanks man
[17:52] tjholowaychuk: and small things like "color + 50%" == "lighten(color, 50%)"

[18:07] tjholowaychuk: they are identical internally

[18:55] TheJH: stagas, at least most of the core stuff (fs, net, http)

[18:56] tjholowaychuk: gotta finish the node stuff soon :( gah
[18:56] tjholowaychuk: no time

[18:57] tjholowaychuk: 'test'
[18:57] tjholowaychuk: should work

[18:57] stagas: and you toString() it you miss it
[18:58] hermanjunge: tjholowaychuk good to see you
[18:58] stagas: then you += the other chunk string with the partial utf8 char again

[21:59] deakblue: @misterinterrupt   I'm just not clear where socket.io decides to use redis or the memory store, is it automatic?

[23:06] Nuck: I love LESS's syntax, but I hate the lack of transparent mixins
[23:06] slickplaid: we're call it MORE
[23:06] MooGoo: middle_east = require('crypto'); //Government fine
[23:06] SubStack: here's one I wrote: http://github.com/substack/node-seq
[23:07] slickplaid: and it'll be chocolate flavored
[23:07] ilikeit: SubStack: i suppose i'll learn exactly wtf is going on if i do that

[23:07] SubStack: ilikeit: step is also a good one to start with https://github.com/creationix/step
[23:07] Nuck: SubStack: I personally find async to be the best
[23:07] ilikeit: SubStack: thanks
[23:07] ShonM: there's just no good, cross-platform way to get the server ip in node 0.4.9
[23:08] Nuck: yeah there is
[23:08] SubStack: Nuck: a lot of people say that, but I don't get it
[23:08] Nuck: Just test against whatismyip.org or something
[23:08] ShonM: an entire request :/
[23:08] SubStack: good thing node doesn't bundle a flow control lib giving it undue weight
[23:08] MooGoo: that sounds like a terrible solutionj
[23:08] SubStack: so we can experiment in userspace
[23:09] Nuck: SubStack: async is great because it doesn't focus on flow control
[23:09] davidbanham has joined the channel
[23:09] Nuck: It focuses on providing async loops and whatnot
[23:09] SubStack: Nuck: seq is a bit like that
[23:10] SubStack: except more chainable
[23:10] Nuck: SubStack: See, that's flow control
[23:10] SubStack: with less combinators
[23:10] Nuck: Too heavy for me
[23:10] Nuck: I just use async because it's code I'd have to write myself otherwise
[23:10] SubStack: Nuck: there is a section on the async readme that says "control flow"
[23:10] SubStack: it's pretty much the same sort of stuff
[23:11] Nuck: SubStack: Yes, way down there
[23:11] Nuck: The stuff I never use
[23:11] SubStack: it's just a different way of packaging
[23:11] Nuck: SubStack: Not really.  It's a difference in the focuses
[23:11] Nuck: async's focus is not on control flow, it's on the loops and such
[23:12] Nuck: control flow is there as a "well, if you want it, here it is"
[23:13] MooGoo: that sounds like a nice feature there
[23:13] Nuck: MooGoo: I don't use it
[23:13] Nuck: I mostly just use the for loop and a few others
[23:14] Nuck: I think I use parallel for my async recursive dependency resolver
[23:14] Nuck: And only because to do anything else would be a fucking hell
[23:14] Nuck: (I know; I tried)
[23:15] MooGoo: you get used to it eventually
[23:15] MooGoo: sometimes fighting the urge to indent makes worlds of difference
[23:16] Wa has joined the channel
[23:17] Nuck: MooGoo: I don't care about indentation
[23:17] Nuck: In fact, it's part of how I read Node code.
[23:18] Nuck: Fuckit, I'm sticking with LESS

[23:22] Raynos: Anyone want to recommend a service
[23:22] Raynos: which will run unit tests on N browsers on the cloud for me
[23:22] joshkehn: Raynos: Sure
[23:22] Raynos: (paid or free)
[23:22] joshkehn: Ah
[23:22] joshkehn: Hrm.
[23:22] maxogden: Raynos: talk to SubStack 
[23:23] joshkehn: Browserling comes to mind.
[23:23] Raynos: I know about browserling
[23:23] Raynos: I dont think it has an API
[23:23] joshkehn: http://browserling.com/contact
[23:23] joshkehn: Shoot them an email.
[23:23] Raynos: im sure there were a bunch of awesome things cocming out of nodeknockout
[23:23] Raynos: for this testing
[23:24] SubStack: Raynos: want a demo?
[23:24] SubStack: Raynos: we've got a prototype for automated testing
[23:24] SubStack: it's amazing
[23:25] Raynos: SubStack: I've seen browserling it's awesome
[23:25] Raynos: I'm thinking of hooking up my unit testing library with a cli
[23:25] SubStack: yes
[23:25] SubStack: that is exactly what we have built
[23:25] Raynos: which just pipes it into a service (browserling) that runs all my tests for me
[23:25] SubStack: check the pm ;)
[23:26] SubStack: it's just a simple HTTP PUT
[23:27] Raynos: I see, awesome tthings
