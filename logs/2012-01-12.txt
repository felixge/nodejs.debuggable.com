[02:46] benvie: otherwise you need to somehow pass which event it is another way
[02:46] mike5w3c has joined the channel

[02:49] secoif: hm
[02:49] benvie: and a lot of times there's useful stuff on the eventemitter object. Since a lot of disparate things use the emitter functionality and plenty of times you want a single handler that simply does stuff to `this` instead of having to pass the object reference in some other way
[02:50] caolanm: anyone know how I can get npm to tell me the path of an installed package?
[02:50] benvie: the functionality of emit itself doesn't require the `this` binding so otherwise that goes unused and useless
[02:50] dmitrig01 has joined the channel
[02:50] benvie: so might as well bind it to the object emitting the event and use it, if you need that reference

[03:09] LeftWing: I started out with binding them to the same UNIX socket (which would be infinitely preferable for obvious namespace issues) but it would appear that SO_REUSEADDR means the next process just clobbers the old one and neither process finds out.
[03:10] LeftWing: jesusabdullah: POSIX file locking.  You can grab an exclusive lock on the entire file which will be released when your process closes for any reason.
[03:10] LeftWing: So it's 'impossible' for the lock to go stale without expiring.
[03:10] jesusabdullah: ah, I see
[03:10] jesusabdullah: There's no way to lock a file with the fs module?
[03:11] LeftWing: Well, not that I've found so far.  I'd love there to be, though, so if anybody knows... :)
[03:11] LeftWing: I mean I could go and write a C++ module to do it, but I'd really like an all-JS solution so that I don't have to fart around with binaries on the Solaris/Linux boxes I'm deploying to.

[07:04] secoif: Hebo callback to constructor is fairly common pattern if the constructor has to do async work. How do you attach a  ready handler, if you haven't created the object yet? Means you need to also add a 'start' method to delay the async operation until the caller has a chance to attach event listeners

[13:15] EuroNerd: I'm a node.js newbie and I've just installed it on Ubuntu Desktop in a VM and am playing with some 'hello world' stuff.  Should I also install some general web server, like Apache or Nginx? Or should node.js be run alone?
[13:15] icebox: EuroNerd: you may run node alone
[13:17] EuroNerd: Assuming I'll write a little web app and will want to expose it to the web (from my laptop or a VPS), should I then have apache/nginx sitting between node.js and the outside world?

[13:20] Joe-Joe has joined the channel
[13:21] EuroNerd: I've also discovered I can't (or shouldn't, anyway) expose node.js on port 80.  Is that because port 80 should be handled by an apache/nginx web server, or is it simply about redirecting traffic from 80 to whatever it's running on internally?

[13:28] zomg: iirc someone said to do something like that
[13:28] zomg: not sure tho :P
[13:29] zomg: o btw Skype runs on port 80 by default...
[13:29] zomg: or it reserves it anyway
[13:30] EuroNerd: hmmm, ok but what's the "proper" way to set up node so that I can access it normally (i.e. thru 80) from the outside?

[13:32] cmr: EuroNerd: A reverse proxy isn't a bad idea, but I personally just open the firewall and have node listen on that port.
[13:33] EuroNerd: reverse proxy sounds complicated, i'm a newbie and want everything the easiest and most standard way
[13:33] EuroNerd: :)
[13:33] cmr: Reverse proxy is simple, it'd be what you'd do with nginx or apache (with mod_proxy)

[13:34] jaw187 has joined the channel
[13:34] cmr: A reverse proxy would be nginx sitting on the public ports and redirecting things to internal stuff.
[13:34] EuroNerd: well, i know what a normal proxy is, i'm not that newbiesh ;)  i'm just new to linux servers and node.
[13:35] EuroNerd: cmr, do you run node.js on a VPS (or otherwise remote server) ?

[13:37] RLa: considering node for new project
[13:38] RLa: it might need c++ linkage to existing app, so it would be perfect

[13:38] erichynds has joined the channel
[13:38] EuroNerd: maritz: yeah, sorry didn't notice the "OR" keyword :)
[13:38] maritz: EuroNerd: you could just use a different port if it's just you who uses it. that's what I do. (because i have stuff on port80 and am too lazy to set up subdomains)
[13:39] EuroNerd: maritz: it'll be public facing (i.e. on a VPS, theoretically accessible to anyone), but I will be the only user for foreseeable future.
[13:40] cmr: EuroNerd: What is your question again?
[13:40] maritz: then use a free port >1024
[13:40] maritz: :3000 seems standard for express apps for example :)
[13:40] jaw187: use mod-rewite if you'
[13:40] jaw187: if you're using apache
[13:40] maritz: i use 3000-3020, didn't collide yet with anything.
[13:41] qsobad has joined the channel
[13:41] EuroNerd: cmr: my question really is what do I need for a simple node.js setup, and do I need a web server (nginx/apache) in particular.
[13:41] djazz has left the channel
[13:41] cmr: EuroNerd: No, you do not need a web server.
[13:42] cmr: Node itself can stand independent.
[13:42] EuroNerd: maritz: I'd prefer it to be rather accessible, I might want to catch a few early users, you never know ;)
[13:42] deoxxa: anyone successfully interfacing with git via node?
[13:42] EuroNerd: maritz: and also it'll be more comfortable for me to use port 80 (i.e. not complicate things when using in the browser)
[13:43] deoxxa: i've just tried out a few git libraries and they all seem to be broken in some way or another
[13:43] cmr: EuroNerd: But if you're setting it up on a server that you'd want to use for other things, a reverse proxy (or mod_rewrite, mod_proxy, whatever else), a web server would be useful

[13:49] maritz: EuroNerd: using port :3000 for yourself is not complicated at all. and changing it later to port 80 and putting a reverse proxy in front of it or using the proper sudo methodology is easily added. especially if you're new to node, i wouldn't recommend sticking with such "admin" problems early on.
[13:49] Industrial: deoxxa: same :E
[13:51] EuroNerd: maritz: sure, adding :3000 at the end of a web address is not rocket science.  ;)  But i'd like it to run the "default" way out of the box.  So, if I undestand correctly, I should go the reverse proxy way?

[13:53] cmr: EuroNerd: Sure
[13:53] EuroNerd: BTW, as I think about it now, most VPSes have preinstalled server editions of Ubuntu (which i'll probably use) so probably it'll have Apache already, right?  
[13:53] cmr: EuroNerd: Hopefully not
[13:54] EuroNerd: lol
[13:54] cmr: Ubuntu Server is fairly minimal.
[13:54] cmr: It shouldn't come with much preinstalled, and especially not apache
[13:54] EuroNerd: that's interesting, i thought it'd have the whole LAMP circus preinstalled, but if not, maybe it's for the better :)
[13:54] sriley: its fairly simple to set up nginx infront of node... and if you want websockets then to also set haproxy up infront of that

[14:41] thinkjson: dscape: no error was thrown. I would expect one.
[14:41] thinkjson: and we don't use it in the browser. just Node.js
[14:42] dscape: oh I see
[14:42] dscape: thinkjson: the error is in the console

[18:35] tkaemming has joined the channel
[18:35] zomg: You could automate it easily
[18:35] teadict: so you don't have to send stuff to ALL routes
[18:35] teadict: zomg: explain yourself
[18:35] zomg: Put all your module names into an array and just have the code loop over them, passing the deps and such
[18:35] teadict: ah
[18:35] teadict: yes..
[18:35] teadict: that's always plan B
[18:35] zomg: If you need another module you just  add it to the array and no need to add extra coding
[18:36] SubStack: just module.exports = function (app, db) { ... }
[18:36] zomg: I basically just do exports.init = function(stuff) { } in my route files
[18:36] teadict: SubStack: but I have many functions to export in each route
[18:36] zomg: and in my main express file I just have a require('somemodule').init(blah)
[18:36] SubStack: and fs.readdirSync(__dirname + '/routes').forEach(function (x) { require('./' + x) })
[18:36] teadict: zomg: could you paste an example of that please?
[18:37] StanlySoManly has joined the channel
[18:37] teadict: SubStack: nice
[18:37] SubStack: or rather
[18:37] zomg: Well it's just a convention I'm using.. all of my route files have an init function which takes the same args
[18:37] SubStack: fs.readdirSync(__dirname + '/routes').forEach(function (x) { require('./' + x)(app, db) })
[18:37] AndreasMadsen has joined the channel
[18:37] fantastikibne: "npm install " command doesnt work on windows?
[18:37] zomg: So when I add a new route file I can just put another line for calling the init into my main file

[18:38] xetorthio has joined the channel
[18:38] SubStack: teadict: happy dissent

[18:38] teadict: wat
[18:39] devongovett has joined the channel
[18:39] SubStack: just make a function that takes the initial parameters and have that function return another function or a hash of functions

[18:52] isaacs: right now, too much of the pain of using binary addons is on the user, and not enough on the developer.
[18:52] isaacs: compile-on-install will be opt-in,and require that you've installed node such that you have a build toolchain

[19:01] deoxxa: isaacs: how about if you can't get access to a certain platform (i'm thinking windows) to build? would it be possible to have some sort of build contribution setup, or would that be the responsibility of the developer?
[19:01] isaacs: deoxxa: that's the "orthgonal issue" i referred to before.
[19:01] isaacs: deoxxa: but, even if it just means it's up to you to have a windows VM and use it, that's better than the current setup.
[19:01] isaacs: really, you shouldn't claim to support windows if you don't have a windows machine to test your program on.
[19:02] deoxxa: this is true
[19:02] isaacs: *especially* if the code gets compiled.
[19:02] tjfontaine: the only way a build-farm would work in that context would be if no external dependencies were allowed

[20:12] devdazed: no, it should be 1234.1234
[20:12] devdazed: thats what i wrote
[20:12] arcanis has joined the channel
[20:12] MatthewS has joined the channel
[20:13] devdazed: if that's the case then the problem is in wrting to the buffer not in reading from it
[20:13] stride: that's not representable in a float
[20:13] deoxxa: someone doesn't understand floats
[20:14] whitman has joined the channel
[20:15] devdazed: a float is 32bits with 24 bits of precesion, what do you mean you can represent that?
[20:15] maushu has joined the channel
[20:16] lietu: decimals with floats are basically just rough approximations, for example, in JS, 0.1 + 0.2 is not exactly equal to 0.3
[20:16] sharkbird has joined the channel
[20:16] devdazed: im aware of the floating point issue in js
[20:16] devdazed: but when writing to the buffer, it should come in as it came out
[20:17] devdazed: im not doing any math
[20:17] lietu: it's not just in js really, it's the definition of floating point
[20:17] deoxxa: then you're aware of the floating point issue in floating point numbers
[20:17] tmcw has joined the channel
[20:17] devdazed: the floating point issue applies to math
[20:17] devdazed: not storage of the number
[20:18] stride: devdazed: there is no 1234.1234 possible in a 32bit IEE754 float and JS doesn't know that the number in the buffer is the same as what you put in your code, what do you expect it to do?
[20:18] devdazed: and if i remember correctly the max for a float is arounbd 3500
[20:19] lietu: basically, if you say "var foo = 1234.1234", if it is stored as a float, it will never exactly store "1234.1234", it will store the closest possible approximation of "1234.1234"
[20:19] devdazed: The maximum representable value is (2−2−23) × 2127 ≈ 3.4 × 1038.
[20:20] devdazed: that is larger than 1234.1234
[20:20] jbpros_ has joined the channel
[20:20] lietu: does not mean it can exactly represent every single value in between max and min
[20:20] stride: devdazed: the aximum representable value is irrelevant, not all numbers between -MAX and +MAX are accuratly representable, that's your issue
[20:20] herbySk has joined the channel
[20:20] lietu: it cannot represent the result of 0.1 + 0.2 exactly as being 0.3, it is something like 0.30000000004
[20:21] devdazed: ok, that makes more sense. i thought you were saying the max was less

[22:15] TheLifelessOne: is there any way to have a function called when a module is required?
[22:15] TheLifelessOne: like an initialization function
[22:15] ecto: SirFunk: yeah, the root of the module
[22:15] ecto: TheLifelessOne: (function(){ doStuff(); })();
[22:15] josephmoniz: globally, you can wrap `require()` independently you can just do stuff before the module.export
[22:16] devdazed: TheLifelessOne: why would you want to do this? what if the module gets required by several other fiels? what should it do?
[22:16] TheLifelessOne: devdazed: yeah, that's true. I didn't think of that.
[22:17] murvin_: anyone knows how to connect to replicaSet in connect-mongo?  or other Session DataStore will be good too
[22:17] isaacs: ecto: neat
[22:17] isaacs: cmr: nah, that just puts it in a special place where conflicts will always happen :)
[22:18] isaacs: just namespace it with your app name or whatever
[22:18] cmr: heh
[22:18] bingomanatee: Murvin_ as a rule, you shouldn't be concerned about replicasets/sharding etc. in the ORM. you connect to the parent system and mongo emulates the larger machine state for you.

[22:22] murvin_: bingomanatee: the concern is that, when nodejs (connect-mongo) connect to Mongo with Replica Set, and only one host is specified .  In case of failover of the host I primarily connected to, will it route to the new Mongo Server?

[22:43] isaacs: SirFunk: what module?  looks like it's doing something bad.
[22:43] shanebo: isaacs our typical app structure is '/config/package.json', but running npm install from '/config' installs modules in that same directory. We'd like to install modules in the root of the app
[22:43] isaacs: shanebo: npm install --prefix=..
[22:43] isaacs: shanebo: er, no, that won't work, i dont thing...
[22:44] isaacs: shanebo: cd config && rm -rf ../node_modules && npm install && mv node_modules ../node_modules
[22:44] isaacs: shanebo: or just put package.json in the cwd
[22:44] isaacs: cp config/package.json .; npm install
[22:44] isaacs: then rm package.json
[22:45] isaacs: jklabo: you might need to `sudo make install`
[22:45] shanebo: isaacs i was afraid of that :)
[22:45] jklabo: isaacs: I'll give that a shot, thanks
[22:46] isaacs: shanebo: it simplifies a LOT of code internally in npm to just always assume package.json and node_modules are in the same place.

[22:49] tomasztomczyk has joined the channel
[22:49] isaacs: shanebo: so, if you put node programs in ./config/node_modules/ then a file at ./config/foo/bar.js would see them, but ./foo/bar.js would not.
[22:49] shanebo: k
[22:49] isaacs: shanebo: it walks up the path looking for node_modules folders in each parent, but it doens't dive into cousin paths.
