[00:32] hotroot: ^^ lol
[00:32] hotroot: I don't really get cygwin, linux is so easy to dual boot...
[00:33] Brandon_R: hey guys
[00:33] Bonuspunk: caioketo if you want to build it you need Visual Studio c++ (express) and python installed
[00:33] Brandon_R: any good books on how to write high performance client-server applications?
[00:33] Brandon_R: more theoretical than experimental
[00:33] Bonuspunk: hotroot the dev tools that are you used to are just aviablable on windows?

[00:34] swaj: some people need Windows for other dev work, and if you can have a good amount of GNU tools, why not?
[00:34] hotroot: Yeah, I suppose that makes sense. Still, better to just dual boot or use the windows version of node
[00:34] swaj: or for gaming.
[00:35] jesusabdullah: games :C

[00:37] Brandon_R: but that's subjective
[00:37] hotroot: I'm very biased against proprietary languages, so I can't give fair looks at them, lol
[00:37] swaj: C# itself is not proprietary.
[00:37] Brandon_R: isn't c
[00:37] Brandon_R: # open source?
[00:37] Brandon_R: the languague, not microsofts implementation of it
[00:38] Bonuspunk: there is a mono port
[00:38] hotroot: Well, it's pretty much only used for Windows development, like Obj-C is to Mac
[00:38] Bonuspunk: i heard it should be good for Android and IO with mono
[00:38] swaj: Mono runs C# on Mac/Unix
[00:38] Bonuspunk: or silverlight
[00:38] hotroot: I don't know any general languages, can't decide between C++ and Python. Speed vs Dev speed
[00:39] Bonuspunk: chchch
[00:39] hotroot: Happy with JS for now though
[00:40] Brandon_R: why not learn c

[00:42] Brandon_R: facebook uses it so it can't be all bad
[00:42] hotroot: And facebook does /everything/ right, just like privacy =P
[00:43] Brandon_R: program wise
[00:43] Brandon_R: not legal wise
[00:43] hotroot: Their mobile code is terrible
[00:43] hotroot: And their regular page code isn't that good either. It always alerts me of new messages while chat is open
[00:44] prettyrobots has joined the channel
[00:44] hotroot: When that message should count as read since I'm in chat
[00:44] hotroot: Anyway, back to JS. I have a question I've never really understood with params.
[00:44] Brandon_R: kk
[00:44] hotroot: For example, in  - Database#run(sql, [param, ...], [callback]) - 
[00:44] hotroot: Is there a way to send just the sql and callback params?
[00:45] hotroot: What if there is a param I don't want to use? Do I just fill it in with null and then it will default?
[00:45] idefine has joined the channel
[00:46] Bonuspunk: hotroot the last time i checked in node.js there is a typeof(param) check ( === 'function' { callback=param; param=defaultParam} )
[00:46] Brandon_R: woah guys
[00:46] insin: hotroot: well, usually that notation indicates optional - just don't pass anything
[00:47] hotroot: how do I not pass anything?
[00:47] insin: by... not...
[00:47] insin: ACTION falls over
[00:47] sorensen__: ACTION head explodes
[00:47] hotroot: No shit, I mean if there are 3 default params
[00:47] sorensen__: :D
[00:47] hotroot: It expects the first to be sql, the second to be [params] and the third to be a callback
[00:47] idefine: how does one handle uncaught exceptions in asnyc functions?
[00:48] Xano has joined the channel
[00:48] sorensen__: the sql is optional?
[00:48] hotroot: If I just leave out params, it will see the callback as arg #2
[00:48] hotroot: No, the [params] and callback are
[00:48] sorensen__: it will likely check if params is a function and treat it as the cb if so
[00:48] insin: [param, ...] an optional number of parameter arguments
[00:48] insin: the impl is likely slicing arguments and checking if the last one is a function
[00:49] Bonuspunk: hotroot for ex. http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/fs.html#fs.mkdir fs.makedir('foo', function(err) { ... })
[00:49] Xano has joined the channel
[00:49] insin: so they can all be optional beyond the sql
[00:49] theCole has joined the channel
[00:49] hotroot: Bonuspunk: It knows that that's the callback?
[00:49] Bonuspunk: yes
[00:50] Bonuspunk: typeof arguments[1] === 'function=
[00:50] theCole: when doing an fs.readFile if returns the file as a Buffer, how do you decompress that?
[00:50] theCole: it*
[00:50] hotroot: What about like this?
[00:50] hotroot: buffer.write(string, offset=0, length=buffer.length-offset, encoding='utf8')#
[00:50] sorensen__: decompress?
[00:50] benlyn_ has joined the channel
[00:50] theCole: maybe decompress is the wrong word
[00:50] hotroot: And I just want to pass string and length
[00:50] Bonuspunk: hotroot for fs.mkdir - type in your node repl > require('fs').mkdir.toString();
[00:51] hotroot: null is the right thing to use right?

[02:03] Sample: When an event callback fires after the browser has already request.end() (speaking 'http'), is there a way to response.write('some update') to the user on the page at that point?
[02:04] Sample: maybe i need some ajax on the client side firing off requests to the server to see if something has updated? hmm.. doesnt seem very efficient

[02:47] hotroot: "SELECT ROW FROM players" what the fuck was I thinking -.-
[02:47] bminer: Lingerance: what do you mean?
[02:48] Lingerance: bminer: `make push` just minfies all my JS files and pushes them to the server in turn, runs the tests, and rollsback if stuff starts failing.
[02:48] bminer: how does that work?
[02:48] bminer: you write those scripts yourself?
[02:49] Lingerance: Yes
[02:49] bminer: also... do you utilize caching on the server for static assets?
[02:49] Lingerance: nginx does the static files.
[02:50] a_suenami has joined the channel
[02:50] bminer: gotcha

[02:52] bminer: ????
[02:52] hotroot: It's an anonymous function though, so I can't pass args, but I thought I didn't have to?

[03:01] clarkfischer: then count the newlines
[03:01] hotroot: ^^
[03:01] Lingerance: Oh right, I can get the offset, thanks.
[03:01] Lingerance: :)
[03:02] clarkfischer: hotroot: looks like its probably a closure problem
[03:03] hotroot: Could be, but the error is saying it doesn't know what this.socket is
[03:03] clarkfischer: yeah
[03:03] clarkfischer: e
[03:03] clarkfischer: exactly*
[03:03] hotroot: You think I closed it off early or summat?
[03:03] clarkfischer: no
[03:03] Lingerance: Try .bind() (it's a function method)
[03:03] clarkfischer: this, in the context of that function, is probably bound to db
[03:03] clarkfischer: just use a var self = this;
[03:03] clarkfischer: then use self instead of this.
[03:03] hotroot: Oooh
[03:04] hotroot: Good idea =D
[03:04] hotroot: Or maybe like, dbThis so I don't have to change the rest of my shit, lol
[03:04] norviller has joined the channel
[03:04] clarkfischer: self isn't even in the same closure
[03:04] clarkfischer: not to mention it ought to be referring to the same this.
[03:05] hotroot: Hmm?
[03:05] clarkfischer: on line 34, you assign self to this (the instance of Client)
[03:06] hotroot: Yeah, it binds the socket to the client object
[03:06] clarkfischer: if, on line 93 you assign self to this again, not only is it in a completely separate closure, it would probably be referring to the same `this`

[03:08] hotroot: Lol, I am so confused. I have a headache, I'm on code burnout, and my eyes are feeling singed. You're saying that's a good thing, I should do in my client object " var self = this;" and then call "self" from the DB func?
[03:08] clarkfischer: http://pastebin.com/diff.php?i=HQ7X8RGh <== see here
[03:08] clarkfischer: ought to work
[03:09] clarkfischer: if you're really hung up on the name `this`, crockford uses `that` iirc
[03:09] hotroot: Why not just define self = this; in the client object?
[03:09] hotroot: Then for every DB call I can just reference self
[03:09] clarkfischer: separate closures
[03:09] clarkfischer: outside function Client(…) self won't be visible
[03:10] hotroot: But the DB call is inside a client method
[03:10] hotroot: lient.prototype.processNew
[03:10] clarkfischer: yeah, but, again, they're separate closures
[03:11] clarkfischer: the only thing they share is `this`, potentially
[03:11] clarkfischer: unless you're calling #processNew from within the constructor
[03:11] clarkfischer: (which you're not)
[03:11] hotroot: So can I do the var self = this; on the first line of the processNew func?
[03:11] clarkfischer: sure
[03:11] hotroot: Since that's it's containing function
[03:11] hotroot: kk
[03:12] hotroot: Thanks a lot =)

[03:28] Ned_: So if I have downloaded underscore.js, I can just require() it and everything's fine, now I want to require() backbone.js, but it requires underscore. Is there any nice way I can direct it to the copy I on disk alreayd ?
[03:28] clarkfischer: Ned_: npm?
[03:28] clarkfischer: npm install backbone
[03:28] Ned_: clarkfischer: that installs a different copy of it
[03:28] clarkfischer: what do you mean 'different'?
[03:29] Ned_: clarkfischer: the situation is that I already have backbone/underscore on my website, and I'd really like node.js to be using the same copies of those files
[03:29] Ned_: clarkfischer: well, npm installs in ~/.node_modules (or whatever path) which is clearly different to the copy my website is using
[03:29] clarkfischer: you need a specific version?
[03:29] Ned_: I'd like node.js and my website using the same copy (since the purpose of the node.js stuff is for testing the website)
[03:29] clarkfischer: npm install backbone@version
[03:30] Ned_: clarkfischer: yes, I know that too :_)
[03:30] Ned_: again though, I'd like to be able to just use the copies I already have on disk
[03:30] Ned_: which seems very close to working
[03:30] Ned_: I can trivially load the copy of underscore.js I already have
[03:30] Ned_: it's just when backbone goes looking for that dep
[03:30] Ned_: then it fails ...
[03:30] clarkfischer: you'd have to make the _ variable visible to the backbone.js module
[03:31] Ned_: Hmmm, is that even possible ?
[03:31] Ned_: without getting too kludgy ?
[03:31] clarkfischer: not really
[03:31] clarkfischer: looks like backbone uses
[03:31] clarkfischer: if (!_ && (typeof require !== 'undefined')) _ = require('underscore')._;
[03:31] clarkfischer: that line
[03:32] clarkfischer: so no matter what, if you're running it under node, it's going to try to require('underscore')
[03:32] clarkfischer: you could always have your server serve up node_modules/underscore/underscore.js
[03:32] Ned_: Hmmm ...

[06:31] JasonSmith: isaacs: About to publish a tool as a possible way to generate the npm site
[06:31] JasonSmith: based on Mikeal's code
[06:31] JasonSmith: As they say: cache invalidation, and naming things. Do you have any opinion about "static plus" vs. "stop motion" vs. "stop action"?
[06:31] isaacs: JasonSmith: hahah
[06:32] isaacs: JasonSmith: this program touches all three of the problems!
[06:32] JasonSmith: the cli is currently bin/static+
[06:32] JasonSmith: totally although I think I have a good solution
[06:32] isaacs: JasonSmith: here is my request: please dump the docs into a folder that nginx can serve up nicely.
[06:32] JasonSmith: hey how come "static+" is not a valid package name? Are you saying you think you're better than GOOGLE?
[06:32] isaacs: i have a folder all ready and waiting to go
[06:33] isaacs: JasonSmith: static+ has a special char in it
[06:33] isaacs: must be filesystem and urlsafe
[06:33] JasonSmith: aw dude, that answer is special
[06:33] joestein has joined the channel
[06:33] isaacs: special?
[06:33] isaacs: oh, hahah
[06:33] isaacs: i've been strongly anti-+-in-urls for a long time now.
[06:34] isaacs: and + in filenames?  ew.
[06:34] JasonSmith: yeah, it supports output to a directory (which it cleans out thanks to rimraf), or an in-memory object, or attachments in a couch doc
[06:34] isaacs: dpkg does that.
[06:34] isaacs: don't get me started.
[06:34] JasonSmith: g++
[06:34] Margle has joined the channel
[06:34] isaacs: yeah, as if you need ANOTHER reason to not use c++
[06:35] isaacs: bsd ports does it to
[06:35] JasonSmith: You're a Windows developer now. In seriousness, do you know if that's a problem on Windows?
[06:35] isaacs: +UPDATES, +BUILD, etc
[06:35] isaacs: no idea.
[06:35] JasonSmith: yeah Unix made the sensible decision that '+' is just as valid or invalid as '-' in filenames
[06:35] isaacs: but long years of web development and command line tooling have convinced me: filenames shall be [a-z.-]
[06:35] JasonSmith: It then failed to take over the world
[06:36] isaacs: maybe --- MAYBE --- some numbers in there.
[06:36] isaacs: i fucked up not forcing lowercase names, and we'll be stuck with that bs forever now.
[06:36] JasonSmith: no underscore huh?
[06:36] isaacs: not in filenames, no.
[06:36] isaacs: (a SHOULD, not a MUST)
[06:36] JasonSmith: yeah I did the exact same thing with Iris Couch subdomains
[06:36] JasonSmith: there was Bob.iriscouch.com and bob.iriscouch.com and as you might expect, that came to a head
[06:36] isaacs: lovely
[06:37] isaacs: at one point we had Markdown and markdown
[06:37] JasonSmith: So, you're saying you don't care what it's called as long as it makes files?
[06:37] isaacs: yeah
[06:37] JasonSmith: I can dig
[06:37] dilvie has joined the channel
[06:37] JasonSmith: TTYL
[06:37] JasonSmith: thanks again
[06:37] isaacs: JasonSmith: so one more thing
[06:37] JasonSmith: yeah
[06:37] isaacs: it'd be rad if it didn't write files 100 times
[06:37] isaacs: i noticed with mikeal's thing, it writes for every change.
[06:37] JasonSmith: So, it hits your db and sees what sequence you're up to, say 1,234
[06:38] isaacs: you almost wanna just walk the db once, and just follow changes from there.
[06:38] JasonSmith: then it hits _changes and it outputs a site when it gets to update 1234
[06:38] isaacs: i see
[06:38] JasonSmith: Next it sits on the feed
[06:38] isaacs: awesome.
[06:38] JasonSmith: You can configure a minimum updates threshold, or a minimum time threshold, and whichever is hit first, it re-outputs a site
[06:38] isaacs: kewl
[06:38] superjudge has joined the channel
[06:39] isaacs: also: it'd be nice if it could try to fetch-on-demand if you hit /foo
[06:39] isaacs: and there's no file there
[06:39] JasonSmith: So if your db changes slowly like a blog, you get a site instantly. If it changes quickly it doesn't go crazy
[06:39] JasonSmith: wait, what now?
[06:39] isaacs: well, i'm gonna set it up so that modules.nodejs.org is an nginx thingie that proxies to localhost:15443 but only if the file isn't found.
[06:40] JasonSmith: okay, and what is 15543?
[06:40] isaacs: some node server.  then that server can fetch just that one, static-ify it, and serve it
[06:40] isaacs: here's what happens: people publish smoething, then immediately go view it
[06:40] caffine has joined the channel
[06:40] isaacs: because we're monkeys.
[06:40] JasonSmith: Yeah, monkey brain
[06:40] isaacs: right
[06:40] realguess has joined the channel
[06:41] isaacs: if it takes 30s to get there (totally reasonable) they go "WTF IS BROKE WHY IS BROKE!?"
[06:41] isaacs: and reload like crazy getting a 404 page, post a bug, email the list, come ask in here, and then someone else views it and goes, "um, works for me?"
[06:41] isaacs: and they feel silly.
[06:41] JasonSmith: I would say for now, considering the site isn't even live, use the CLI. But it is just a super thin wrapper around the API
[06:41] isaacs: yeah
[06:41] shiawuen has joined the channel
[06:41] confoocious has joined the channel
[06:41] isaacs: that bit is easy to add later :)
[06:42] JasonSmith: So the next step is that your node program, among the other things that it does, now it does require('static-plus') and you teach it how to build a page from a doc
[06:42] JasonSmith: that way you can reuse code when you get that monkey looking for his own package
[06:42] isaacs: nice
[06:43] JasonSmith: So, if you deploy to couch, you get two things:
[06:43] JasonSmith: 1. Atomic update, regardless of how much the site changed
[06:43] JasonSmith: 2. You can query the couch api, with request()
[06:43] JasonSmith: Just saying. But nginx is the 1st milestone
[06:43] isaacs: right
[06:44] isaacs: but we've already got nginx goin
[06:44] JasonSmith: Well you've already got couch goin but I'll stop bikeshedding now
[06:44] isaacs: caching to html is sort of nice.
[06:44] superjudge has joined the channel
[06:44] isaacs: so, your vision of this is putting the html into a different couchdb as docs?
[06:44] isaacs: or as attachments in the existing one?
[06:45] JasonSmith: My vision is for it to perfeclty strike the balance between simple and flexible. But that said, yeah I want to switch the iriscouch.com site to static plus
[06:45] iRoj has joined the channel
[06:45] JakeyChan_ has joined the channel
[06:45] JasonSmith: Currently it runs on static plus's closed source shitty grandad
[06:46] isaacs: JasonSmith: cool.  well, i've got no objection to running on whatever iriscouch provides.
[06:46] JasonSmith: Anyway, yeah, it builds static HTML pages just like before, but they all go under one document
[06:46] jaitaiwan has joined the channel
[06:46] isaacs: i see
[06:46] JasonSmith: so you have a document with 5,000 html attachments. Whatevs.
[06:46] isaacs: right
[06:46] isaacs: no reason why we can't have both
[06:46] JasonSmith: Then to deploy you HTTP COPY it from the private id to the public one
[06:46] JasonSmith: yeah
[06:46] pquerna: this is how i feel tonight http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxMd93aCvd0
[06:47] JasonSmith: also I'm hoping static plus can deploy to S3. So you can just CNAME your domain and get a decent web site
[06:47] pquerna: shit-be-working-wooooooooo
[06:47] JasonSmith: isaacs: Oh, quick kanso question?
[06:47] isaacs: pquerna: \o/
[06:48] JasonSmith: kanso has its own package repository now. They are weird because they install both Node code and also generate code for Couch
[06:48] pquerna: #nodejsIsMyDeathStar
[06:48] JasonSmith: isaacs: I think the correct answer is for kanso to use the npm api. Where should I start to learn how that works?
[06:48] isaacs: JasonSmith: you mean, as a registry?
[06:49] langworthy has joined the channel
[06:50] JasonSmith: isaacs: Let's say I use Node to generated some javascript, and a package.json. It's in /path/to/generated-app/. And my Node script knows that this app depends on some npm packages, like async or whatever
[06:50] JasonSmith: So I want to make /path/to/generated-app/node_modules/ and I want the desired version of async in there
[06:51] CoffeeIV has joined the channel

[08:02] jomoho has joined the channel
[08:03] JasonSmith: Yeah
[08:04] kickingvegas: JasonSmith: wanted a way to handle errors in a standard way, in this case munging the pg errors (which may already be extended from Error ) and Twilio responses which you have to roll your own
[08:04] JasonSmith: Yeah
[08:04] JasonSmith: although I've seen a lot of code where they do er = new Error(); er.my_custom_stuff = 'some custom data'; throw er;
[08:05] benvie: Error functionality is partially unspecified
[08:05] kickingvegas has joined the channel
[08:05] JasonSmith: (in Node). So in the catcher, instead of checking for the error type, you check for duck type. if(er.my_custom_stuff) then_this_is_mine(); else whatever()
[08:05] kickingvegas: while I'm at it, how do you determine the base class of an object? For some reason I heard that instanceof is broken

[08:06] JasonSmith: benvie: yeah. I believe err.stack is defined in all modern browsers and v8, but the contents of err.stack are "implementation-specific"
[08:06] JasonSmith: which is to say, a bunch of baloney
[08:07] benvie: var myerror = Error(); myerror.name = "SomeStuffBroke". myerror.message = "It broke so fix it".; throw myerror;

[11:34] dscape: Glenjamin: but i already have npm installed and didnt want to uninstall the stable version just to do development
[11:34] dscape: hence the question on is there's any recommendations on doing that
[11:34] Glenjamin: hrm
[11:34] Glenjamin: try "npm link" inside the repo
[11:34] Glenjamin: aside from that, ask isaacs how he does it
[11:35] dscape: Glenjamin: yes, but is that the right way to do it? will it break something? :)
[11:35] Glenjamin: doesn't look like he's up yet

[14:04] ppcano: how to force a npm publish, to use the same current version???. I am getting ( Failed to update the data, Cannot publish over existing version. )
[14:04] slaskis: baudehlo: is there a pcre module for nodejs?
[14:04] baudehlo: slaskis: someone was talking about one on the nodejs mailing list.
[14:04] slaskis: ppcano i think you only use add -f
[14:04] baudehlo: lemme do a dig
[14:04] bnoordhuis: eeemsi: 0.6.6
[14:05] ppcano: slaskis: not working
[14:05] eeemsi: bnoordhuis: thx - looking forward to it ;)
[14:05] slaskis: ppcano: maybe --force then?
[14:05] baudehlo: slaskis: hmm, it was just discussed - no github link.
[14:05] slaskis: pretty sure i've used that flag myself for npm
[14:05] slaskis: ah, would be nice to have
[14:06] ppcano: slaskis:  i guess could be a bug, but not sure. I tried force in several ways without success, Error: EPUBLISHCONFLICT https://gist.github.com/1476681

[14:06] baudehlo: it would. I emailed the guy who posted about it just now.

[17:30] isaacs: hthen it's new for you :)
[17:30] TimTimTim: i've looked up some of the issues on github but they're related to much older versions
[17:30] isaacs: TimTimTim: you're doing require("express")?

[17:31] windsurf_: thanks ryah 
[17:31] isaacs: TimTimTim: did you install it locally in your project?  what does `npm ls` show you?
[17:31] TimTimTim: i'm trying the code on socket.io to begin with.. which is: var app = require('express').createServer()
[17:31] TimTimTim: 	,io = require('socket.io').listen(app);

[17:33] t4nk885: but getting a 502 error in response
[17:33] isaacs: TimTimTim: you may want to change your terminal font, or do `npm config set unicode false`
[17:33] t4nk885: does that mean the site is protecting against scraping in some way?
[17:34] TimTimTim: my first thought is to uninstall/reinstall everything
[17:34] TimTimTim: but i'm afraid i'll just end up with the same error and it'll be a waste of time
[17:35] braoru has joined the channel
[17:35] isaacs: TimTimTim: can you require("express") in a node repl?

[17:36] isaacs: wait wait
[17:36] isaacs: what isn't working?
[17:37] TimTimTim: in node.log it says "can't find module express"
[17:37] TimTimTim: nginx gives 502 bad gateway

[17:39] isaacs: TimTimTim: somewhere, something is doing require("express") and failing
[17:39] isaacs: TimTimTim: there should be a stack trace.
[17:39] isaacs: follow the trace

[17:40] TimTimTim: in my app.js file, i do require('express') as shown on socket.io express example... and it simply doesn't work, and generates the "can't find module express error" in my node.log error log

[17:43] TimTimTim: why would that be?
[17:43] isaacs: TimTimTim: you need to share your code, i think, rather than describe it.
[17:44] TimTimTim: the code is exactly as shown here:
[17:44] isaacs: TimTimTim: since the repl require() works in your app dir, and your app doesn't, you have an assumption that is false.
[17:44] isaacs: i guarantee it
[17:44] TimTimTim: http://socket.io/#how-to-use
[17:44] TimTimTim: ohhh that must be what it is
[17:45] isaacs: what is?

[18:28] chjj: zomg: you said you thought your high cpu usage was from the gc having to sift through a lot of data
[18:28] chjj: im saying it could be the case that something else is using all your cpu, and as a result the gc pauses are long
[18:28] zomg: and while it hits that, the node app tends to stop responding to requests

[18:56] vipaca: isaacs: I'm having trouble with npm, I don't want to go to npmjs.org for deps. I've tried to install from tarballs, but inevitably these libs have there own deps. I've tried installing those deps, but I don't get the nested structure I expect. Do you have any suggestions for offline npm installation.

[19:18] zomg: Right disabled the very last thing that could be doing something in the code... Mongoose. If it still spikes to 100 cpu after this, I don't know if I can think of anything else :P
[19:19] Aikar: vipaca: www.mikealrogers.com/posts/nodemodules-in-git.html - although its only half right, you should also do the same for shared modules too.

[22:02] dscape: just require them

[22:02] dscape: actually that is what most people do

[22:04] megalomix: is this the "best" way ?
[22:04] megalomix: yes it works
[22:04] megalomix: but is it logically correct?
[22:04] ben_alman: is there a lib for nodejs that wraps all async methods in a promise implementation?
[22:04] Me1000 has joined the channel
[22:04] dscape: megalomix: i have no idea what this page loaded thing is
[22:05] megalomix: as i told you i have a variable...i don't know if this is a good way
[22:05] dscape: i cant see any scenario why you woul dneed that
[22:05] dscape: maybe im just not understanding the code right
[22:05] dscape: but i think it would be cool to watch those tutorials i said
[22:05] megalomix: dscape, image that there is res.render('page') instead of res.redirect('')

[22:05] dscape: it will help you see how others are doing this
[22:05] BrianE has joined the channel
[22:05] megalomix: if i have two res.render from two different inners functions
[22:05] ben_alman: https://github.com/kriszyp/promised-io seems incomplete
[22:05] megalomix: how to understand if i rendered a view before?
[22:06] trotter has joined the channel
[22:06] dscape: an http request is a one time thing,
[22:06] dscape: it gets intercepted by one route in express
[22:07] dscape: and you control the flow to do exactly one res.render
[22:07] micheil has joined the channel
[22:07] megalomix: no
[22:07] dscape: so that shouldnt happen
[22:07] megalomix: no no wait,
[22:07] megalomix: if you read a form...and that form check WHERE to send the request...maybe you show show different view depending of the user request
[22:07] megalomix: so the controller see the request of that page...read the FORM and then show the correct view
[22:08] megalomix: i can't do a controller for each thing....i do ONE controller for each page....and the relative model (functions to calls)
[22:09] joshgillies has joined the channel
[22:09] jlank: speaking of express, I'm working on a project where for example I get a list of sites like so: app.get('/sites', routes.sites); where routes.sites is an exported function(req, res).. now say I wanted to call that sites module/function from the command line, instead of in the browser... ?
[22:09] megalomix: so there is not a problem...i only would like to understand how to see if a view is already shown
[22:09] dscape: megalomix: request.get -> show the form
[22:09] dscape: request.post -> get the form and process it
[22:09] jlank: would I be best to just interface with my app on the CLI via curl?
[22:10] dscape: ditch the request.all
[22:10] dscape: done
[22:10] megalomix: hmm
[22:10] megalomix: i thino you didn't understand me
[22:10] megalomix: i know what you say
[22:10] megalomix: it is correct
[22:10] _dc has joined the channel
[22:10] mmalecki: creationix: hey, which version of node does webos use?
[22:11] megalomix: but try to imagine there is a form on that page with (exmaple) radio button and i need to show the view reading that radiobutton
[22:11] megalomix: (it is an example)
[22:11] mmalecki: creationix: or, maybe you could add some feedback to https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/2334#issuecomment-3148155 when you have some spare time? 
[22:11] megalomix: but i need to read the form first to try to understand what view to render
[22:11] gtramontina has joined the channel
[22:11] dscape: megalomix: even if you have an if else
[22:12] dscape: you can still ensure that only one of those happen at one request
[22:12] dscape: hence one res.render
[22:12] megalomix: yes....exactly
[22:12] megalomix: BUT....is there a method to check if a view is rendered OR this is the only manner to do that?
[22:14] isufy has joined the channel
[22:14] dscape: megalomix: i dont know if there is a method to do that or not

[22:14] vguerra has joined the channel
[22:14] dscape: but i dont think you should be in a situation where you need to ask
[22:14] megalomix: so i need to check the flow with if elase
[22:14] megalomix: k
[22:14] dscape: at least i never was, and never saw anyone talking about a problem that requires that
[22:14] dscape: yup :)
[22:15] megalomix: no no
[22:15] megalomix: it is not a problem
[22:15] megalomix: i only need to understand if my "method" is good
[22:15] megalomix: if there is not a method to check it
[22:15] megalomix: i think it should be good
[22:15] megalomix: so, ok.
[22:15] dscape: go for it! :)
