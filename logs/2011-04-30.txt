[00:26] rauchg: if you have an app where organizing functionality around `routes` in the client side
[00:26] rauchg: is a good structural approach
[00:26] rauchg: then i'd give it a shot.
[00:27] tjholowaychuk: we should copy the express routing and make a sammyish thing
[00:27] tjholowaychuk: so it's closer
[00:27] tjholowaychuk: similar looking already though

[00:31] Owner_: Are json.parse and JSON.stringify the preferred ways to deserialize and serialize data from a file?

[00:32] perlmonkey2 has joined the channel
[00:33] pcardune has joined the channel
[00:33] Owner_: Would it be normal/good to just have a big, nested object that's data only, and serialize that, instead of making objects with functions in them?

[00:33] mscdex: probably
[00:34] Owner_: I was happy that I was being all OOP-ey, yoo :|
[00:34] Owner_: too*
[00:35] mscdex: well, you could convert the functions to their source strings, but then you wouldn't necessarily know to eval them as functions unless you know ahead of time
[00:36] Owner_: yeah
[00:36] Owner_: using toSource?
[00:36] dgathright has joined the channel
[00:36] adnam: serializing functions isn't a problem as long as you don't have free variables
[00:36] mscdex: yeah, JSON.stringify allows a second argument which is a callback that is executed for each value
[00:36] Owner_: that would be neat, and i would know to eval them upon reconstitution
[00:37] Owner_: thanks
[00:37] techwraith: mscdex: and a third argument to tell it how many spaces to use as tabs
[00:37] techwraith: :)
[00:37] Owner_: ah
[00:37] mscdex: the callback is called with two values: key and value
[00:37] mscdex: fyi

[01:07] xiagox has joined the channel
[01:08] tjholowaychuk: brendan^^: if you are building web apps there is little reason not to use it
[01:08] brendan^^: Good to know
[01:08] tjholowaychuk: unless you enjoy routing yourself, rendering views with string concats, and writing three lines just to redirect instead of one etc
[01:08] brendan^^: so Jade+SASS, perhaps?
[01:08] rauchg: brendan^^ it's the de-facto standard
[01:08] rauchg: jade + stylus
[01:09] brendan^^: I'm not familiar with stylus, but i *love* sass.
[01:09] tjholowaychuk: node doesnt have a sass implementation
[01:09] tjholowaychuk: brendan^^: http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/
[01:09] tjholowaychuk: the latest things sass has been adding
[01:09] tjholowaychuk: were from stylus
[01:09] brendan^^: it appears that npm install sass adds it, tjholowaychuk 
[01:09] tjholowaychuk: lists, functions etc
[01:09] rauchg: brendan^^ it's legacy code, and it's a very old implementation
[01:09] brendan^^: bummmmmer.
[01:10] rauchg: check out stylus, it's better.
[01:10] Nexxy: EJS IMO
[01:10] zzak: actually i love rendering views with string concats
[01:10] tjholowaychuk: brendan^^: I wrote both haha sass.js is not even close to a full implementation
[01:10] Nexxy: but I don't like hamlesque stuff
[01:10] brendan^^: tjholowaychuk: lol, fair enough :D
[01:10] MikeMakesIt has joined the channel
[01:11] zzak: especially because coffeescript gives me interpolation to make my string concatenation even sexier

[01:14] zzak: cookie sheets
[01:15] brendan^^: What is session support when installing Express?
[01:15] tjholowaychuk: brendan^^: just sets up the session middleware for you
[01:15] tjholowaychuk: since people get order wrong
[01:15] tjholowaychuk: haha
[01:15] tjholowaychuk: nothing you cant add later if you want to
[01:16] brendan^^: okay. is it easy enough to hook Express up to Socket.IO?
[01:16] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[01:16] tjholowaychuk: easy to get socket.io going with any http server
[01:16] brendan^^: kk
[01:16] kmwallio has joined the channel
[01:17] brendan^^: thanks for the help, tjholowaychuk.
[01:17] tjholowaychuk: np
[01:17] justinTNT: session support is there as an optional middleware, that just works. express is lean and unobtrusive: it seems to bend to your will and doesn't get in the way of whatever other net tricks you want node to do (eg socketio)

[01:27] brendan^^: So in a default Express installation, the index.jade file inherits from layout.jade?
[01:27] isaacs has joined the channel
[01:27] tjholowaychuk: brendan^^: yeah, by default the view passed to render() is rendered, then passed to the layout as the "body" local
[01:28] brendanjerwin has left the channel
[01:28] tjholowaychuk: res.render(view, { layout: false }) or app.set('view options', { layout: false })
[01:28] brendan^^: Does Jade eventually make sense at some point?
[01:29] tjholowaychuk: it's pretty simple, feel free to use something within html though like ejs etc
[01:29] brendan^^: hmm, well, its intriguing, but it feels kinda magical
[01:29] quackquack: pretty soon, you will cringe upon seeing the repetition of regular html
[01:30] tjholowaychuk: it's pretty simple once you get used to it a bit. "foo" is a tag "foo bar" is a tag with text, "foo(bar: 'baz')" is a tag with an attr
[01:30] tjholowaychuk: "foo.bar.baz" is a tag with two classes, "foo#bar" tag with id
[01:30] tjholowaychuk: "foo.bar#baz(something: 'else') hello" tag with all of them
[01:30] tjholowaychuk: ".foo" div with class "foo", "#foo" div with id "foo"
[01:31] brendan^^: snsible
[01:32] brendan^^: !!! and body!= body remain mysterious
[01:32] justinTNT: I don't like templating. I was inspired by weld to build something similar ( http://blog.nodejitsu.com/micro-templates-are-dead ) 
[01:32] tjholowaychuk: !!! is just a doctype, kinda dumb syntax though haha I should add "doctype 5" etc
[01:32] brendan^^: tjholowaychuk: did you write jade
[01:32] click_ has joined the channel
[01:33] tjholowaychuk: brendan^^: body is just the tag name, != body outputs the body html (from the page view render)
[01:33] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[01:33] brendan^^: Hah! Awesome.
[01:33] brendan^^: you are a clever chap.
[01:33] tjholowaychuk: = body
[01:33] tjholowaychuk: would work
[01:33] tjholowaychuk: BUT
[01:33] tjholowaychuk: = escapes html
[01:33] tjholowaychuk: it's ugly != version is more explicit and ugly looking so you only unescape when necessary
[01:33] tjholowaychuk: some default buffering to unescaped but that is really bad
[01:34] tjholowaychuk: s/some/some template engines/
[01:34] justinTNT: brendan : checkout http://substack.net/posts/7a0e41/npmtop

[02:02] NuckingFuts: I mean, you'd think the computers would say "uh, that's not smart"
[02:02] NuckingFuts: But no, it just let it happen

[02:03] NuckingFuts: mjr_: Huh?
[02:03] mjr_: NuckingFuts: EBS is basically disk drives over a shared network.

[02:04] perlmonkey2: Probably the wrong channel for this, but I've got a node process which spawns a Perl process and communicates via STDIN/OUT. But I'll be passing long strings back and worth. How do people usually mark the end of a message?

[02:10] perlmonkey2: SubStack: I hope next to your tropical island you've got a mega-yacht and a death star for your personal amusement.

[02:10] blueadept: http://pastie.org/private/erktrjqbmzjyzblxamra would anyone know why this code is throing a can't set headers error? i'm setting the content-type before hand though

[02:12] blueadept: mscdex: really?! what's weird is the photo leads only about 10% before node will crash with the error
[02:12] blueadept: leads*loads
[02:12] halfhalo: I totally stole a rails theme from a gem for my node stuff
[02:12] perlmonkey2: SubStack: after I make my first million, I'm definitely cutting you in :P
[02:12] SubStack: perlmonkey2: oh I have a cpan account I should probably throw dnode all up on there but I have no idea how
[02:12] mscdex: blueadept: well, that's the only way that can happen with the code you've provided, and it's probably what is happening
[02:12] perlmonkey2: haha, I was just about to go looking on cpan for it :P
[02:13] SubStack: I should probably eat today
[02:13] blueadept: ah, ok. will drill down further, i'm using a new mongo driver for this part of the code, so it could be related to that
[02:13] halfhalo: http://REDACTED.preyourmind.org
[02:13] SubStack: I had some coffee and an orange and it's 19:13 already
[02:13] SubStack: one of those days
[02:14] mscdex: blueadept: 'data' will fire for each _chunk_, so if the photo doesn't fit into a single chunk (which could easily happen), you'll get that error because you're resending the headers
[02:14] xiagox has joined the channel
[02:14] mscdex: just use a boolean var to make sure it's only sent once, then just send the chunks after that

[02:17] Guest23956: also, it ran for quite a while the first time until the error. The 2nd time is exactly that output.

[02:17] Guest23956: Redhat. ancient. um
[02:17] SubStack: node-rhyme
[02:17] SubStack: I need it for my talk
[02:17] halfhalo: ok, time to make this node script act as a reverse proxy + integrate a little regex into it
[02:18] mscdex: Guest23956: right, it'll do that because there's no need to recompile the previous files, since the source files haven't changed
[02:18] SubStack: "freestyle rpc" after all so this is very apropos
[02:18] Nexxy: lol
[02:18] mscdex: Guest23956: if you're using rhel4 or something old like that, that's probably why

[04:50] oninoshiko: justinTNT: then atleast I'm not going down a dead end... I've tried to use http.all to push the headers out before the static happens, is this the wrong method (I'm doing checking of Accept: to make sure I dont send anything unexpected, so the headers aren't static)
[04:50] Draggor: gcc (Ubuntu 4.4.3-4ubuntu5) 4.4.3
[04:50] mscdex: huh...
[04:50] mscdex: and you're just doing `gcc leet.c` ?
[04:50] Draggor: yup
[04:50] mscdex: i dunno then
[04:50] Draggor: though I did a wget on the raw link

[07:12] mjr_: I just realized that we have over 125 node processes running in our production environment.  Seems like a lot.
[07:13] wao: :)
[07:14] pquerna: i'm scheming to use node-webworker for a thing so I can just kill -9 them to 'stop' a task. i suspect that'll bump my count pretty quickly.
[07:14] TomY has joined the channel

[07:15] xiagox has joined the channel
[07:16] superjudge has joined the channel
[07:17] pquerna: mjr_: hmm.. surprisingly little in production i'd say right now :-/  prolly more node instances running on buildbots.
[07:17] marlun: When using a local node_modules folder. Do you add the whole thing to git in your projects? :)
[07:17] mjr_: I add it to my gitignore
[07:18] mjr_: pquerna: rumor has it that you guys have a pretty big node-based workforce these days.
[07:18] pquerna: yessss
[07:18] mjr_: nice
[07:18] cbiscardi has joined the channel
[07:18] mjr_: We've got an astounding 4 people doing node fulltime.
[07:18] pquerna: trying to get stuff into more production stuff soon, but its not quite the same as when we were a startup
[07:18] pquerna: apparently we sell our customers SLAs
[07:18] pquerna: (damn)
[07:18] mjr_: huh
[07:19] mjr_: I wonder what that's like.
[07:20] pquerna: well, and the other thing, there is now a process to open sourcing things
[07:21] pquerna: its not just hold a 'board' meeting at lunch :)

[07:25] mjr_: chapel: sadly, no.  We want someone in SF.
[07:25] chapel: ah
[07:25] mjr_: This will probably be relaxed once we are wildly successful.
[07:25] chapel: yeah if I was in sf or at least in cali, I would have a job right now
[07:25] xeodox: ajak1: So I don't need to worry at all?
[07:26] ajak1: xeodox: not about SQL injections. there may be other types of injections though.
[07:26] SamuraiJack has joined the channel
[07:26] chapel: trying to at least get some freelance work, but its still a bit fringe
[07:26] xeodox: ajak1: Like what?
[07:26] mjr_: xeodox: there are likely all sorts of security issues with node because it is still so new and hasn't been thoroughly scrutinized by everybody.
[07:27] ajak1: xeodox: I don't know that much about mongo, try #mongodb
[07:27] mjr_: However, because it is so new and cool, generally nobody cares to look for security problems.
[07:27] xeodox: Is node OK to go into production..?
[07:27] markwubben has joined the channel
[07:27] ajak1: although i doubt there's anything as scary as a buffer overflow
[07:28] ajak1: xeodox: use a reverse proxy
[07:28] galaxywatcher has joined the channel
[07:28] xeodox: whats a buffer overflow
[07:28] xeodox: (whats a buffer)
[07:28] mjr_: xeodox: there's no good way to answer that in general, but lots of people run node in production
[07:29] ajak1: xeodox: too long to be explained here but it's a security issue with mostly really bad consequences, but not as prevalent today as it was a few years ago
[07:30] ajak1: i would recommend running Node behind something like nginx
[07:30] ajak1: for production
[07:31] pquerna: i always wondered about the reverse proxy advice.
[07:31] pquerna: would it really prevent a remote exploit in the http-parser
[07:31] ajak1: probably not but it might prevent other exploits
[07:32] xiagox has joined the channel
[07:32] ajak1: have there been any vulnerabilities in http-parser thus far?
[07:32] Druide_ has joined the channel
[07:32] mjr_: I've never heard of any
[07:32] marlun: I'm having a problem with Connect's bodyParser middleware. When it gets an ajax request which has Content-type: application/json but then has no body it never returns (runs the next() method). I guess the data and end events never run.
[07:33] clee: xeodox: http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Do+I+Have+to+Worry+About+SQL+Injection
[07:33] mjr_: I dunno, I just run node in production, exposed to the internet.  It's probably dangerous, but it is less complicated than having a reverse proxy.
[07:33] clee: mjr_: it's also probably way faster
[07:33] ajak1: nginx is pretty fast and also event-driven
[07:33] clee: nginx may not add *much* lag to each connection, but it's not going to be completely free of performance hits
[07:34] mjr_: it's also completely free of websocket support
[07:34] mjr_ has left the channel
[07:34] wao: mm, give try, use nginx or varnish :)
[07:34] mjr_ has joined the channel
[07:34] wao: nginx also do cache?

[07:35] pquerna: only if you just do a tcp reverse i thought, not if its parsing http?
[07:35] pquerna: (which defeats the entire purpose of a reverse proxy for security)
[07:35] ajak1: this is true

[07:40] pquerna: dekz: http://journal.paul.querna.org/articles/2011/04/05/openssl-memory-use/
[07:40] pquerna: dekz: i mean.. it works well for C++ side leaks
[07:41] pquerna: just using the default built in object allocation instrument
[07:42] pquerna: dekz: are you looking for a c++ or js side thing?
[07:42] dekz: c++
[07:42] v8bot:  dekz has given a beer to c. c now has 5 beers.
[07:42] pquerna: lucky c.
[07:42] dekz: lol
[07:42] pquerna: sampling rate sounds like one of the cpu profilers
[07:43] pquerna: the object allocation is hooking into malloc
[07:43] pquerna: so no sampling rate in it
[07:43] ajak1: c++
[07:43] v8bot:  ajak1 has given a beer to c. c now has 6 beers.
[07:43] dekz: Yeah I was using the "Leaks" instrument, not "Allocations"
[07:43] ajak1: dekz++
[07:43] v8bot:  ajak1 has given a beer to dekz. dekz now has 1 beers.
[07:43] ajak1: wow
[07:43] pquerna: yup
[07:44] pquerna: leaks are for.. allocated but then unrefernced
[07:44] pquerna: which can happen
[07:44] dekz: I was actually attempting to Watch the tests run using nodeunit but that doesn't seem to work as I'd expect out of the box

[07:55] ryah: okay - i need an opinion on a C API.
[07:55] ryah: we are writing a bunch of async functions oio_read, oio_write, etc.
[07:56] ryah: obviously they issue their corresponding syscalls inline if possible
[07:56] ryah: if the syscalls don't block (common for oio_write, for example) a "oio_req" object specifies a completion callback
[07:57] ryah: the question is: as a user would you like the option for these functions to be sync when the syscall completes without EAGAIN.
[07:57] ryah: ?
[07:57] ryah: or do you not really care - and would rather just have the callback being called on nextTick
[07:58] ryah: "next tick"
[07:58] hackband has joined the channel
[07:59] ryah: s/block/complete sync/
[07:59] mjr_: What would it mean to be "sync" in that case?
[07:59] mjr_: Also, isn't that kind of how it works now?
[08:00] ryah: e.g. ssize_t oio_read(oio_req* req, char* data, size_t len)
[08:00] ryah: returns size read - if done sync
[08:00] ryah: returns -1 and sets errno to OIO_PENDING
[08:00] mjr_: oh, ok
[08:00] ryah: that is async
[08:00] mjr_: So you could return right away if it actually worked
[08:00] ryah: yeah
[08:00] mjr_: huh
[08:01] ryah: say you try to read one byte - and the kernel has that all ready
[08:01] ryah: s/all ready/already/
[08:01] seivan has joined the channel
[08:01] ryah: it can just get it immediately
[08:01] mjr_: I guess if you have to handle the async case, it seems like you'd probably always just do it that way anyway, as long as that worked.
[08:01] stride: so I'd have to put the stuff that is executed inside a function, call that function afterwards if it was sync and make sure the callback doesn't do anything when it's called later on?
[08:01] boghog: was thinking same as mjr_
[08:02] mjr_: I mean, as a user of this API.  If I have to handle the async case, I think I'd just always do it async.
[08:02] stride: yeah, me too
[08:02] ryah: okay.
[08:02] ryah: i believe it to be slightly more expensive to wait until the next tick
[08:02] ryah: probably some cache concerns or something
[08:02] mjr_: yeah, it probably is
[08:03] ryah: but it makes the user interface very difficult
[08:03] mjr_: probably is a handy optimization in a number of cases to short circuit the async case.
[08:03] boghog: i guess if performance really matters, it might be a nice optional feature 
[08:03] mjr_: But think of the complexity costs
[08:03] ryah: the problem is that i do this: (wait for gist)

[08:05] mjr_: you will also be impressive
[08:06] ryah: assume TOTAL_BYTES = 10mb
[08:06] ryah: and CHUNK_SIZE = 2 
[08:06] ryah: you end up calling on_read() recursively
[08:07] mjr_: a lot of times
[08:07] stride: where's chunk_size comming from?
[08:07] ryah: the number of times read(2) can return sync is a lot
[08:07] mjr_: who is the asshole who set CHUNK_SIZE to 2?
[08:07] ryah: so you get stack overflow

[19:29] asdfsafdsa: i dont get i then, it's probably you. i understand  every single line i write in coffee/jade
[19:30] bingomanatee: I'm okay with that - I just think that using one language to write another language is a dangerous and stupid path to take as a developer.
[19:30] tjholowaychuk: the abstraction certainly has tohelp you more than it hurts you
[19:30] tjholowaychuk: but with all abstractions there are limitations
[19:31] tjholowaychuk: bingomanatee: like c to asm?
[19:31] bingomanatee: To me when the only added value for a language is convenience and syntax then the risk/reward ratio is skewed.
[19:31] tjholowaychuk: :D I think it makes sense when done properly and for "real" reasons
[19:33] bingomanatee: I spent three months learning Java FX because it was "Elegant" and "convenient" - only to discover that it was bloated, riddled with memory overruns for everything but the most non-trivial uses, and so abstract that it made it impossible for you to actually fix these problems. 
[19:33] mcantelon has left the channel
[19:33] Bwen: I'm sorry but an abstraction that redefine the source language so it does not even look alike, does not help me. Companies dont hire ppl that know jade or coffeescript, they hire ppl that know javascript and html... Some abstraction make you lazy and forget what it was in the first place.

[20:01] Nexxy: because "vegan" is a bad word amongst neckbeards

[20:01] mcantelon has joined the channel
[20:02] Owner_: I see whhy one would want to be vegan, but the no honey part is taking it way too far imo
[20:02] Nexxy: bees can't sign contracts
[20:02] Nexxy: giving us permission to rape and pillage their home
[20:02] nickbaugh: cbiscardi: any alternatives you found that use node/mongo/express?
[20:02] nickbaugh: cbiscardi: I just need a lightweight stack/template
[20:02] Owner_: since small-medium scale beekeepers are probably helping bees in general
[20:02] Nexxy: on a regular basis
[20:02] tjholowaychuk: nickbaugh: express is light-weight
[20:02] Owner_: taking a small amount of extra food is not what i would consider rape and pillage
[20:03] tjholowaychuk: nickbaugh: extremely so, mongo maybe not so much
[20:03] cbiscardi: nickbaugh: no real CMS's yet. I'm writing one, but it's nowhere near release yet
[20:03] Owner_: neither is providing extra homes
[20:03] Nexxy: they are perfectly capable of providing their own homes!
[20:03] cbiscardi: nickbaugh: express + mongolian works well though
[20:03] Nexxy: mongoose!!
[20:04] Owner_: Nexxy: the keepers still provide extra homes

[20:04] rie31: anyone using sleepy mongoose?
[20:05] AntelopeSalad: tj, in your precondition screencast you said when setting up app.param() that it's kind of acting as a middleware but it's not, if you had to describe it in 1 word what would it be?
[20:05] cbiscardi: rie31: isn't that for python?
[20:05] tjholowaychuk: AntelopeSalad: tough call, yeah it is basically middleware though
[20:06] AntelopeSalad: parameterware!
[20:06] rie31: yup, it's standalone http server in python
[20:06] tjholowaychuk: AntelopeSalad: hahaha
[20:06] tjholowaychuk: you can also now next('route') within route-specific middleware etc
[20:07] tjholowaychuk: to jump to the next matching route (if any)
[20:07] Nexxy: tupperware

[20:08] AntelopeSalad: not sure what to make of that, but it's probably useful
[20:09] tjholowaychuk: AntelopeSalad: it's handy when a precondition fails
[20:09] tjholowaychuk: but its not necessarily an error
[20:09] AntelopeSalad: that's actually what i'm trying to handle now heh
[20:10] AntelopeSalad: like, if a user doesn't exist
[20:10] tjholowaychuk: yeah either you next(new Error('failed to load user') or next('route') and just hit a 404

[21:01] Wizek: Hello! Can anyone tell me hoe does Node.js simmilar to (or different from) Python when it comes to Web Application Development?
[21:02] Nexxy: node is liek twisted for python
[21:02] Nexxy: kinda?
[21:03] unter_cover: fischkopp
[21:03] mscdex: Bwen: nothing but plain javascript
[21:03] Bwen: mscdex: awsome
[21:03] unter_cover: node is low level and twisted is high level
[21:04] Aria: And node is almost all async, and twisted has to try to play with a sync python world.
[21:04] Aria: Sometimes badly.
[21:05] nlco has joined the channel
[21:05] CarlosEDP: do any of you guys have a prgmr VPS?
[21:06] Wizek: Aria, so Node I guess better handles more connections. But is it faster if actually there aren't too much people visiting?
[21:06] CarlosEDP: is it possible to have more transfer BW?
[21:06] Aria: define 'faster'?
[21:06] Wizek: Aria, returns a respons in less time on average
[21:07] Wizek: to client
[21:07] Bwen: it'll server more client, the time it takes to serve the content.... that depends how you code it
[21:07] Prism has joined the channel
[21:08] Aria: Yeah, that depends on a lot of factors. If you're trying to solve a specific slowdown, it might help or not, depending on what that is.
[21:08] Aria: It's a LOT easier to have requests depend on each other in node -- reporting on live things.
[21:08] Aria: That's why I love it.
[21:09] max_dev has joined the channel
[21:09] Wizek: Aria, how do you mean that they depend on each other?

[21:16] Aria: I like building things in node. Web apps are almost an aside though.
[21:16] Aria: I also like javascript as a language.
[21:16] Aria: But I feel like I'm in control, I don't feel like I'm fighting the framework.

[21:37] mscdex: mattp_: there's mysql and nosql bindings/modules
[21:37] cbiscardi: peerless: install mongodb with a package manager like homebrew or straight from the website, npm is for node packages like mongoose
[21:37] mscdex: mattp_: there's also several ORMs out there for mysql and nosql
[21:38] mscdex: mattp_: as halfhalo said, there is sequelize, which is a mysql ORM that uses a libmysqlclient binding
[21:38] mscdex: although it could be easily modified to use node-mysql instead (pure javascript mysql module)

[22:14] xeodox: tjholowaychuik: I got the middleware part to work. But what happens when I do next(new Error('no permissions')) ....what does "new Error" do?
[22:14] xeodox: it throws an exception but how do I act on it 
[22:15] brownies: isaacs: i just followed all the instructions here https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation

[22:15] isaacs: brownies: yep, first doa.  fixing :)
[22:15] Bwen: xeodox: isnt more like "throw Error('blah'):" ?
[22:15] brownies: ah, ok, thanks :)
[22:15] xeodox: bwen: dono, I'm just following express guide
[22:16] Bwen: xeodox: express.. whats that?
[22:16] insin: $ npm -v -> 1.0.1 (on Cygwin, of all things)
[22:16] insin: congrats, isaacs
[22:16] tjholowaychuk: Bwen: throwing wont get you anywhere with async logic you have to pass the exceptions around
[22:16] isaacs: brownies: npm i npm -g
[22:16] tjholowaychuk: throwing will just kill your server
[22:17] xeodox: So what happens with "next(new Error...." because that's whats in the express guide but i have nooo idea what that means
[22:17] Bwen: tjholowaychuk: yep I understand :)
[22:17] malkomalko has joined the channel
[22:17] tim_smart: xeodox: `new Error` creates a new error object from its constructor.
[22:17] xeodox: I understand next() goes to the controller that called the middleware, but what does next( new Error...go to?
[22:18] brownies: isaacs: i have no idea what that did, but something happened. and now "npm install clutch" dumped my entire server.js
[22:18] brownies: (and it didn't work)
[22:18] tjholowaychuk: xeodox: middleware with an arity of 4 can handle errors
[22:18] tjholowaychuk: xeodox: (err, req, res, next)
[22:18] tjholowaychuk: express has app.error() as a shortcut for this
[22:18] tjholowaychuk: or express.errorHandler() etc

[22:21] NuckingFuts: All the windows ones were those damned "ergonomic" keyboards, which I just cannot stand

[22:31] isaacs: malkomalko: but if you are running the bins directly, it should probably be installed globally
[22:31] isaacs: malkomalko: unless you enjoy typing ./node_modules/.bin/foo

[22:31] tim_smart: malkomalko: npm config set global true
[22:32] malkomalko: but that really doesn't force it as a global.. any reason why?  If your package is a cli, shouldn't it always be installed globally?

[22:32] brownies: ugh, i have to run a local mongodb server too =/
[22:32] isaacs: zzak: if they have bins defined, and you're installing them globally, then yes.
[22:32] malkomalko: hmm, true

[22:33] Nexxy: execunary
[22:33] Nexxy: binatable?
[22:33] isaacs: malkomalko: even for a bin, if your program execs things via npm scripts, then it'll work inside the package.
[22:34] isaacs: malkomalko: but npm is more a hotel than a jail :)

[22:44] whozman: for the sake of my sanity, can someone please confirm that no matter what I do with promises, if I have a long running blocking process I can't process other requests (code link: http://www.pastie.org/1851863)
[22:44] bingomanatee: do you use forever?
[22:45] whozman: @bingo was that for me? No I don't.
[22:45] bingomanatee: okay. and I dont expetct this to help but .., what is a promise?
[22:45] SubStack: whozman: yep there is only one thread and if you hog it up you can't do anything else
[22:46] nulled has joined the channel
[22:47] bingomanatee: the answer to the question, "How do I take the fastest language ever and make it the slowest language ever" is "don't use callbacks". 
[22:47] bingomanatee: If you are going to do something like that use a process fork and a callback. 
[22:47] SubStack: bingomanatee: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promise_(programming)
[22:47] whozman: @bingo its like a contract to execute something in the future. Thanks SubStack.
[22:48] SubStack: whozman: there are lots of other asynchronous flow control abstractions too
[22:48] tyler-iphone: is a continuation a promise?
[22:48] SubStack: ones that sit on top of callbacks are especially popular in node like step
[22:48] nulled: Soon there will be SMTP FTP IMAP POP3 servers all written in javascript using node.js
[22:48] bingomanatee: cool.
[22:49] tyler-iphone: nulled: there aren't already ?
[22:49] whozman: right, but no matter what the abstraction nothing helps with the blocking stuff. that has to go outside.
[22:49] whozman: ty guys
[22:49] nulled: I havent looked for a postfix replacement or a dovecot replacement using node.js  is there one already? haha
[22:49] Nexxy: that would be nice, learning postfix/dovecot was a pain
[22:50] bingomanatee: whozman -- the point (i think) we are making is that if you can break your countdown funtion into a process that can be run in parallel and then have a callback on the result

[22:51] tyler-iphone: SubStack: is that a yes or a no?  ;)
[22:51] SubStack: tyler-iphone: promises are specifically a type of proxy object
[22:51] SubStack: so not really
[22:51] bingomanatee: I'm not grumpy. I'm old.
[22:51] tyler-iphone: gotcha
[22:51] Nexxy: that's debatable!
[22:51] nulled: How about an  Nginx/PHP  replacement?  Express?
[22:52] Nexxy: express is love
[22:52] tyler-iphone: https://github.com/andris9/n3
[22:52] SubStack: I thought node was an nginx replacement
[22:52] tyler-iphone: to call node an nginx replacement is quite the understatement
[22:52] SubStack: ACTION <-- never used nginx
[22:52] nulled: node is jsut the platform....
[22:53] nulled: node will do anything soon... even GUI... but for now any networking app is very easy to do in node.js right now
[22:53] SubStack: node is just a hack to get v8 to write to files and talk on the network :p
[22:53] tjholowaychuk: nulled: nginx is definitely not an application framework so express wont help there lol

[23:00] davemo: mcantelon: so the intent is a local node_modules file for every installation?
[23:00] rfay has joined the channel
[23:00] Nexxy: unless you use -g
[23:00] mcantelon: davemo: The idea is to bundle dependencies with your project rather than reying on global mdoule installs.

[23:01] brettgoulder has joined the channel
[23:01] Postmodernist: mcantelon: Sounds messy. What if a module is updated to fix a security flaw and your project is still using the old version?
[23:02] Nexxy: IMO it's a lot less messy than accidentally breaking older apps when you upgrade a module and the API has changed
[23:02] davemo: so then what about running things you did want installed globally?
[23:02] davemo: :P
[23:03] Nexxy: but then again what do I know, i'm just a slow child ._.
[23:03] mcantelon: davemo: There's an option to do a global install (-g I think).
[23:03] Postmodernist: Nexxy: You should be able to load a module by version so it doesn't matter that it's installed globally.
[23:04] Nexxy: I didn't realize npm kept older versions when upgrading
[23:04] Nexxy: I guess that works too
[23:04] davemo: before my environment variable was set to export NODE_PATH=$(npm root -s)
[23:04] davemo: now that returns an undefined
[23:04] isaacs: tyler-iphone: sure.  you are encouraged to download the script, read it, and then run it, if you'd like
[23:04] isaacs: tyler-iphone: i trust it, because i own that server :)

[23:05] Postmodernist: Question for node.js: How can I load a module of a specific version?
[23:05] isaacs: davemo: npm root -g is probably what you want
[23:05] Postmodernist: Like, can require() be module version-specific?
[23:06] davemo: isaacs: ok, and if i want something like coffee-script and docco installed globally i do npm install {package} -g  ?
[23:06] isaacs: Postmodernist: npm install foo@version;  require.resolve("foo") // ./node_modules/foo/blah.js
[23:06] isaacs: davemo: bingo!

[23:06] isaacs: davemo: i don't recommend monkeying wiht the NODE_PATH.  better to just install locally the things you require()

[23:07] davemo: isaacs: yeah i can see the advantage of it

[23:08] bingomanatee: is there any way to npm node itself into your project and have a complete self contained bundle?

[23:13] bingomanatee: Because it is arrogant - you don't know how it will affect third party modules and you might grab a namespace that the core language comes along and needs.

[23:19] bingomanatee: You might find yourself tired of pasting in boilerplate but it gets the job done, 
[23:19] ixti: bingomanatee: unfortuntely util.extend() will fail exactly the same in this particular situation
