[00:35] mscdex: use prototypes if you can
[00:35] Aria: Both work.
[00:35] mscdex: otherwise you get a copy of the functions for each instance

[00:36] echosystm: ok

[00:36] echosystm: yes
[00:37] bgould has joined the channel

[03:25] chjj: only if you use the exports object

[03:29] chjj: it looks like "view.js" is extending the prototype of the http response
[03:29] Jalava: it's just wierd how it just requires modules without assigning them to anything
[03:29] chjj: so it just needs to be executed, it doesnt need to expose anything
[03:30] chjj: jalava, its adding functions to the response object's prototype
[03:30] chjj: "http.ServerResponse.prototype"
[03:30] Jalava: oh yeah
[03:30] Jalava: didn't spot that one

[04:13] Jalava: hmm, figured out a way to organize modules hiearchically for your application: add stub file into node_modules that just says export = require('../lib'); and then add index.js to all your directories exporting next level out
[04:13] xeodox: What's the best way to log everything in node.js?
[04:13] pyrotechnick: console.log
[04:13] Jalava: allows you to do require('project-name').Foo.Bar.Baz.Class
[04:14] Jalava: but still keeps node_modules "clean" so that it only contains external dependencies
[04:14] haha has joined the channel
[04:14] haha: asdas

[04:26] iwinulose has joined the channel
[04:27] gkatsev: xeodox: loop over all the properties and copy each one over. If it's an object, recurse.
[04:27] xeodox: really
[04:27] gkatsev: there may be libs that would do it for you
[04:28] jesusabdullah: xeodox: You may be able to use js-traverse to make it less painful though :)
[04:28] xeodox: jesus man 
[04:28] jesusabdullah: yeah
[04:28] xeodox: thats insanity
[04:28] gkatsev: you can use underscore's extend to do deep copy

[04:34] xeodox: .clone worked
[04:35] gkatsev: xeodox: .clone is a shallow copy.
[04:35] xeodox: whats the difference between shallow and deep?
[04:35] xeodox: i just want my new variable to be excactly like the other one. (except dont change the other one at all)
[04:35] gkatsev: xeodox: objects inside of your object are referenced rather than copied.

[06:12] chapel: does it work if you take out the console.log?
[06:12] pyrotechnick: no the only reason im logging it was because it was screwed in the first place
[06:12] chapel: ah
[06:12] chapel: idk, try putting return after it
[06:12] pyrotechnick: i did

[06:21] pyrotechnick: i recon its chrome
[06:21] chapel: could be
[06:21] chapel: I just hate havin issues like that, that end up not really being issues, but waste time
[06:22] pyrotechnick: chrome is progressively getting more and more unstable

[06:35] pyrotechnick: written in
[06:35] oblivionx: its pretty end to end, order management, tracking etc, so clients are logged in all day
[06:35] oblivionx: what i want to do is use node.js as a sort of real time notification system
[06:35] tprice: hey anyone use duostack.com for node apps?
[06:35] oblivionx: where i could trigger an event like "you have a new message"
[06:36] oblivionx: and it would pop up a notification or something like that
[06:36] btipling: oh I figured it out,nevermind
[06:36] pyrotechnick: oblivionx: what's your question exactly
[06:37] oblivionx: well i guess im interested on what i can do with node.js on a high level
[06:37] oblivionx: like can i replace things in my application that currently depend on polling on some interval

[06:44] m64253 has joined the channel
[06:45] oblivionx: so, right now, in our application, each user has an inbox, which basically just contains messages from the software, like NewOrder, NewMessage, etc
[06:45] oblivionx: its just a db table, nothing fancy
[06:46] oblivionx: so currently, we poll server on some interval, checking for new messages
[06:46] oblivionx: this is just a simple javascript setInterval
[06:46] oblivionx: what i want to do is instead, is when a new order comes in
[06:46] oblivionx: can I send a request to a node.js server, which would then fire off some js callback on any clients logged in?
[06:47] groom has joined the channel
[06:47] chapel: well yeah, you could do that
[06:47] oblivionx: is that something that node.js is designed to handle? or am i just kinda of hacking it?
[06:47] chapel: nope, it is well suited for that
[06:47] oblivionx: im looking at the really simple example on the homepage right now
[06:48] oblivionx: so my main confusion is what does the client side js look like?
[06:48] chapel: depends on what you use to handle that
[06:48] chapel: socket.io could work well
[06:48] oblivionx: yeah so lets say i just want to alert this hello world
[06:48] chapel: there are a few things built on socket.io that make it easy

If I run `ab` against it, it will only do around 16500 requests, and then it stops taking requests for a loooong time (easily 20sec+), before resuming.. - anyone heard of something like this?
[09:08] fangel: (v0.4.2 btw)
[09:08] cachemoney: might be file descriptor limits

[09:58] cachemoney: Wa?
[09:58] Wa: :p
[09:58] Wa: yes
[09:58] cachemoney: dude, nickserv!
[09:59] dnunes: You can try to send it a message just like nickserv does and see if it will try to identify itself sending a PM to you with its login password.
[09:59] cachemoney: i accidentally send LOGOUT though :(
[09:59] Wa: oh god that's awful
[09:59] dnunes: I think it's "notice", not a message =/ Won't work.
[09:59] dnunes: Maybe with a *really* poor implementation. Not likely.
[09:59] Wa: it's a privmsg
[09:59] zilch has joined the channel
[09:59] dnunes: From nickserv?
[10:00] path[l]: hi, does anyone know if I can use a github download url inside my package.json as a dependency?
[10:00] dnunes: I use "on ^*:NOTICE:*NickServ IDENTIFY*:?:". But maybe it works differently on the bot?
[10:00] dnunes: I'll try it...
[10:00] squeeks: path[l]: What? Why? Why not just submodule the repo into your own codebase?
[10:00] Wa: cachemoney monkey already made it log out of nickserv
[10:01] Wa: check the /whois :p
[10:01] `3rdEden: v8: "12324234524523452345234524352345".split(/(\d{4})/)

[10:01] cachemoney: Wa: i did that
[10:01] Wa: yes I know
[10:01] cachemoney: hahah yeah
[10:01] Wa: I don't know why I typed monkey
[10:01] `3rdEden: v8: "12324234524523452345234524352345".split(/(\d{4})/).filter(function(v){return v !== ''}).join(' ')
[10:01] v8bot: `3rdEden: "1232 4234 5245 2345 2345 2345 2435 2345"
[10:01] cachemoney: i wish i did something else before that
[10:01] Wa: memoserv or something? xD
[10:02] path[l]: squeeks: cause my repo was quite big at this point and my deployment system takes a while. I thought using npm intall works better for me
[10:02] Wa: ah nah, there's a bunch of cool command you coulda done :(
[10:03] cachemoney: i know, damnit

[10:05] Wa: normally says netsplit for that
[10:05] Wa: cachemoney; how long does it take ns to kill for idenitfy failure!?
[10:05] Wa: xD
[10:05] Wa: I've sent like 20!
[10:05] cachemoney: Wa: apparently never
[10:05] cachemoney: 20 what?

[10:07] zilch has joined the channel
[10:07] Wa: lol
[10:07] Wa: maybe if you set it to do that for unregistered people using the name
[10:09] Wa: hahaha
[10:09] Wa: you could get memoserv to make v8bot execute a command
[10:09] cachemoney: really?
[10:09] cachemoney: LOLOL
[10:10] cachemoney: Wa: how? does it just send memos?
[10:10] zilch has joined the channel
[10:10] Wa: ah wait, it's a notice, does v8 respond to notices?
[10:10] cachemoney: no
[10:11] Wa: damn
[10:11] Wa: if only it was a privmsg :<
[10:11] cachemoney: haha
[10:11] cachemoney: what other services are there
[10:12] dnunes: chanserv, nickserv and memoserv, I think.
[10:12] Wa: I think they all respond in notices though :(

[10:30] xeodox: can you give example
[10:30] squeeks: node file.js > file.out
[10:31] xeodox: that's it?
[10:31] squeeks: well, yeah.

[10:39] littke has joined the channel
[10:39] Wa: xeodox &> directs both to the same file
[10:39] xeodox: right
[10:39] xeodox: But I want error one file, everything else another.
[10:39] mendel_: check that link xeodox
[10:39] mendel_: ....

[10:41] cachemoney: @xeodox: :)
[10:41] xeodox: How come you guys all recommend 1 carrot? In the doc it says >> is append. Dont you want to append instead of new...?
[10:41] cachemoney: xeodox: my bad
[10:41] xeodox: huh?
[10:42] cachemoney: if you wanna persist between executions you use >>

[10:45] squeeks: tmedema: depends on the content and client. Chrome ignores Content-Type headers on binary data and guesses it, But for Mp3's everywhere else, it's "audio/mpeg".
[10:45] xeodox: v8:p==!p
[10:45] v8bot: xeodox: ReferenceError: p is not defined
[10:45] chjj: was about to say that
[10:46] chjj: i think its specced now, you send "application/octet-stream" for audio and video, and user agents are supposed to sniff the content type
[10:46] chjj: not sure
[10:46] chjj: tough
[10:46] chjj: though*
[10:46] tmedema: squeeks: are you sure that's the only thing? I've set content-type, content-length, connection (keep-alive) and accept-ranges (bytes).. it works fine for flash, but chrome audio tag tries to close the connection as soon as it gets a response from my server
[10:46] tmedema: trying to stream a mp3 (mpeg)
[10:47] chjj: cachemoney, why the hell is v8bot spamming me??
[10:47] cachemoney: chjj: oops, typed wrong nick
[10:48] chjj: you bastard
[10:48] squeeks: tmedema: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=NMX2m9wa this is my nginx config. I serve a few Tb out of that to Chrome clients without a hitch.
[10:48] tmedema: chjj: application/octet-stream ?
[10:48] chjj: tmedema: i havent looked at the happenings at whatwg lately, but i think thats what was being discussed several months ago
[10:49] chjj: application/octet-stream and the user agent is supposed to sniff the content type
[10:49] tmedema: hmm, squeeks, you never had errors like 'ECONNRESET, Connection reset by peer'' ?
[10:49] squeeks: no.
[10:49] tmedema: :/
[10:49] tmedema: I have no idea what to try
[10:49] tmedema: it's not easy to debug this 
[10:49] squeeks: Wireshark/tcpdump it.
[10:50] tmedema: squeeks: you mean on the server side?
[10:50] squeeks: either end, doesn't matter.
[10:50] tmedema: never used either, guess I should read about it
[10:51] squeeks: you'll see both client and server chatter happen. When you capture through Wireshark, make sure you're doing no other HTTP requests at the time of capture and then just filter the capture to find the packets.
[10:52] squeeks: tcp.port == 80 will work, or ip.addr == <server IP address>, Then just select a packet from the set and select Follow TCP Stream. Blue is client, Red is Server.
[10:54] tmedema: squeeks: the interface list is empty in wireshark
[10:54] squeeks: run it as root.

[12:11] badboy_: Hey guys, I just came across this piece of code: https://github.com/ded/Reqwest/blob/master/reqwest.js and wanted to ask why it uses "!function(ctx){}(this)"
[12:11] badboy_: specially why it uses !function
[12:11] cachemoney: what the hell
[12:11] eldios: it's a negative test case
[12:12] eldios: ctx usually stands for context 
[12:12] badboy_: (I just shortened context from the code ;)
[12:12] eldios: lol
[12:13] eldios: then you call function passing ctx, whatever returns should be a function
[12:13] eldios: which would be called with this as an argument
[12:13] badboy_: I wanted to know why one would ever use !function(){}() instead of leaving out the !
[12:13] eldios: whatever is returned is negated
[12:13] ed_v8: /me
[12:13] eldios: I *GUESS*
[12:13] badboy_: this function in Reqwest does return nothing.
[12:14] eldios: meaning that there is somewhere an empty "return ;" statement?
[12:15] cachemoney: }(this);
[12:15] cachemoney: the hell?
[12:15] badboy_: the anonymous function itself does not call return after all.
[12:15] eldios: oh
[12:16] badboy_: ^^
[12:16] badboy_: I will ask the coder why he did it ;)
[12:16] chjj: badboy_: it puts the ! in front of it to make it a function expression
[12:16] eldios: ^^ let us now
[12:16] chjj: rather than a function statement
[12:16] chjj: so it didnt have to be wrapped in parantheses
[12:16] chjj: whoever did that couldve used anything
[12:16] Esteb has joined the channel
[12:17] chjj: it didnt need to be an exclamation point
[12:17] badboy_: ah. so leaving out the ! it needs to be wrapped in () to be executed?
[12:17] chjj: yeah, otherwise its a function statement, rather than an expression
[12:17] cachemoney: badboy_: yeah, that's why it looks really weird
[12:17] badboy_: Ah, ok. thank you
[12:17] chjj: you couldve also done: ~function() {}();
[12:17] chjj: you couldve also done: +function() {}();

[12:40] rworth has joined the channel
[12:40] Wa: well we figured out how to PM arbitrary messages
[12:40] Wa: and cachemoney dereged him
[12:40] inimino: I run it, so I kind of have an interest in this.
[12:40] cachemoney: oh.
[12:40] zilch has joined the channel
[12:40] Wa: so we thought disconnecting him would make him reconnect/rereg
[12:40] Wa: but he didn't :(
[12:41] edelabar has joined the channel
[12:41] Wa: the disconnect was just forcing him to excess flood
[12:41] cachemoney: yeah it was kicked for excess flood
[12:41] inimino: well, if you can make it do anything, it's just as well that it didn't come back until it's patched.
[12:41] Wa: he was sending seven times as many messages as we were
[12:41] cachemoney: inimono: PM?
[12:41] inimino: sure
[12:41] cachemoney: *inimino
[12:42] Wa: well first, inimino what's the newest version? What you were running or ed_v8 ?
[12:42] inimino: v8bot is the one I run
[12:42] Wa: both have similar exploits
[12:42] inimino: I don't know what ed_v8 is
[12:42] Wa: I know I'm asking which is the newest code :p
[12:42] Wa: um
[12:42] inimino: cachemoney ⋱ sure
[12:42] zilch has joined the channel
[12:42] Wa: cloned from here I think https://github.com/eisd/v8bot/
[12:42] inimino: oh, I don't know
[12:42] Wa: is yours old?
[12:43] inimino: I am running more or less that, but with some fixes that aren't there yet
[12:43] Wa: ah..
[12:43] Wa: well yours actually has one extra exploit for sending arbitrary messages
[12:43] cachemoney: yeah
[12:43] inimino: and I haven't checked out the repo recently, so... maybe newer and older
[12:43] cachemoney: well
[12:43] cachemoney: more than one
[12:43] Wa: when I say arbitrary messages I mean arbitrary privmsgs specifically, nothing else
[12:43] inimino: ok
[12:44] inimino: well, that's not terrible but it should be fixed anyway
[12:44] Wa: oh it is :p

[12:51] Wa: I noticed :p
[12:51] zilch has joined the channel
[12:51] cachemoney: someone should fork v8bot and improve it

[14:01] gboesebeck: i test cloud9, but they need a couple month to stabilzed it
[14:01] |sWORDs|: taf2, no I need to check if what comes in is valid json, which is why I do a try catch with JSON.parse

[14:02] mikegerwitz: |sWORDs|: It doesn't? For me it parses just fine
[14:02] gboesebeck: rgr, have a look at gvim, aptana.... or simple vim...mhh
[14:02] |sWORDs|: jsonlint thinks it's valid (should be valid, it's jsonrpc 2.0 spec) but JSON.parse gives an error

[14:07] mikegerwitz: |sWORDs|: JSON.parse converts a string of valid JSON to an object. If request is already an object, why parse it?
[14:08] |sWORDs|: it's in an object now, but it will be what the client is sending over tcp/ip later
[14:08] mikegerwitz: |sWORDs|: Then you want JSON.stringify to convert it to a string
[14:09] mikegerwitz: |sWORDs|: But yes, as a string, it will work
[14:09] zilch has joined the channel
[14:09] |sWORDs|: mikegerwitz: yeah but that would break the test, I'll move the object to a string.
[14:09] mikegerwitz: |sWORDs|: I'd recommend using JSON.stringify on an object rather than hardcoding it as a string though..that gets messy
[14:11] |sWORDs|: mikegerwitz: It's only hardcoded to build the checks, it will be send by clients later.

[15:09] jtmkrueger: http://pastie.org/1871949
[15:09] e6nian: jtmkrueger: just git clone from node git repo, then checkout to the latest tag version,then https://gist.github.com/959113
[15:10] jtmkrueger: that's the end where it failed
[15:11] squeeks: jtmkrueger: shove export NODE_PATH="/usr/local/lib/node" into your shell config, pointing it towards wherever your node bin is.
[15:11] nphase: JSON.parse() should work in with node.js right?

[15:14] carter_: thoughts on using coffeescript with node.js?
[15:14] squeeks: no, so you can get your cognitive dissonance more effectively.
[15:15] brianc: carter_: just say "no" to coffeescript
[15:15] dyer has joined the channel
[15:15] carter_: brianc: that bad huh
[15:15] carter_: brianc: it seems more like ruby, is that a bad thing?
[15:15] jtmkrueger: e6nian: thanks for the gist link, but as a noob, I don't know exactly how to "checkout to the latest tag version"
[15:16] jtmkrueger: do you mean to run git status
[15:16] jtmkrueger: and checkout files that are out of date?
[15:16] christkv has joined the channel
[15:16] brianc: carter_: makes your open source project less likely to be contributed to. makes your code harder to debug. adds a "compile" step to your dynamic language. obscures what's actually going on. you still have to mentally "translate" the coffee script into what it's actually doing in javascript.  re-introduces the "context switch" of multiple languages 
[15:16] carter_: hrmmm
[15:16] carter_: that's not good
[15:16] mikegerwitz: jtmkrueger: git checkout v0.4.7
[15:16] carter_: brianc: what about geddy?
[15:17] brianc: those are what I perceive as drawbacks
[15:17] e6nian: jtmkrueger: mikegerwitz is right,do you use git?
[15:17] jtmkrueger: yea
[15:17] brianc: as far as advantages for coffeescript you have "groovy whitespace sensitive syntax with some nice sugar"
[15:17] brianc: carter_: not sure about geddy, but isn't that kinda like express?
[15:18] carter_: brianc: from what i've read yes, but geddy is an MVC like django or rails

[15:19] jtmkrueger: e6nian: ... still new at this, I don't get what you mean there, sorry
[15:19] brianc: carter_: ah okay. one of the nice things about rails is the huge amount of plugins and "out of the box" you get with it...but you have to invite a monolithic framework onto your server to get those advantages. With geddy you get a monolithic server without the plugins or big community? I dunno...all of this is just...like...my opinion, an.

[15:21] swaj: I do too :)
[15:21] joaojeronimo: Hi everyone. I'm following the instructions to use the jerome-etienne/neoip PPA in Ubuntu 11.04, but it installs me NodeJS 0.2.6 and I need the latest stable... what more can I do besides compiling it ?
[15:21] carter_: idk much about sinatra
[15:22] swaj: sinatra is basically just a DSL on top of Rack.  It's really sweet.  No fluff, no BS.  Adds some basic stuff like Session support, and then your app functions as Rack middleware.
[15:22] zooweemama: how can i make npm beautiful in osx terminal....it looks so pretty on my ubuntu machine 
[15:22] wadey: joaojeronimo: We've built some debian packages for 0.4.7 here: https://ci.public.simplegeo.com/job/node/

[15:22] wadey: joaojeronimo: haven't shared much outside our company, so hopefully it works for you :)
[15:23] swaj: carter_: yep
[15:23] carter_: swaj: and you can still write in javascript if you like so if you need to connect to something like neo4j

[15:24] Bogh has joined the channel
[15:24] swaj: carter_: honestly there are a lot of advantages to using JS on the backend... it really unifies your stack.  I think something like express on the backend with KnockoutJS on the front-end makes for a very compelling and easy development environment.
[15:25] joaojeronimo: it's working wadey :) Thanks!
[15:25] Postmodernist has joined the channel
[15:25] swaj: being able to send ajax POST requests using jQuery and then pick them up within express is so easy.  Your JSON objects just work.  No serialization required.

[15:25] markc has joined the channel
[15:25] Bogh has left the channel
[15:26] swaj: joaojeronimo: and then if you use something like mongodb, you can basically stuff your JSON object right into the database.

[15:29] Postmodernist: So, require('http').post() surely exists then? Are there docs for it?
[15:30] Bonuspunkt: > http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/http.html
[15:30] Postmodernist: np
[15:30] wadey: joaojeronimo: its solving a different problem really, but still really usefull

[15:31] Postmodernist: I made a decision that an HTTP POST would be better than HTTP GET from intra-node.js server communication.

[15:37] cachemoney: use RPC
[15:37] swaj: Postmodernist: node.js is asynchronous.  You don't do it synchonously.  You can create a function once and pass it as a callback to each request if you'd like.

[15:47] Corren: cachemoney: that's what I was thinking as well.
[15:47] wonginator1221: Quick question:
[15:47] brianc: anyone use jqtpl with express? I got it rigged up so you can use the same "partials" in your server templates & then pass them down to the browser as client jquery templates. render html on server or browser in the exact same way!
[15:47] Corren: code from a year ago seems like 10 years given how fast things change now

[16:11] squeeks: cachemoney: no, the problem is Apple.
[16:11] cachemoney: lol
[16:11] squeeks: wink_: doesn't add up, iTunes has been on windows longer than safari, by a few years
[16:11] wink_: im not sure what you're saying?
[16:12] wink_: they ported their custom ui controls to windows for itunes
[16:12] wink_: that allowed them to easily port safari
[16:12] cachemoney: webkit is developed by google and apple right?
[16:12] wink_: linux doesnt have the luxury of the first step
[16:12] cachemoney: i think apple originally forked webkit
[16:12] squeeks: wink_: you're only thinking of the technology here and not the bigger picture.

[16:13] cachemoney: aberry: it is
[16:13] cachemoney: webkit.org
[16:13] wink_: there is no problem here, its just not worth the work for apple at the end of the day
[16:13] aberry: can get involved at webkit dot org - has a cool gold version of the safari icon
[16:13] tmedema: Chrome can play mp3 with html5, right?

[16:15] tmedema: squeeks: well then I have no idea why my mp3 aint playing, whenever I try to stream it to my html5 audio tag the browser causes a "client reconnection" error
[16:15] cachemoney: should have been: WebKit was originally derived by Apple Inc. from the Konqueror browser's KHTML software library for use as the engine of Safari web browser and has now been further developed by individuals from the KDE project, Apple Inc., Nokia, Google, Bitstream, Torch Mobile, Samsung and others.

[16:43] mscdex: "node" is a HAM-radio program thing
[16:43] cachemoney: hahahahahahahhaah
[16:43] tmedema: so now we know that the client does something strange after receiving a bit of binary data, squeeks ?
[16:43] cachemoney: are you serious?
[16:43] zooweemama: eldios: thermodynamics next week plus some other crappy ones
[16:43] mscdex: that's why on debian you have to use "nodejs" as the package name in apt
[16:43] johnroach: mscdex, haha this is so stupid
[16:44] mscdex: so i think this is the same issue, both use the same binary name
[16:44] cachemoney: mscdex: that'll install like node 0.2
[16:44] johnroach: mscdex, i actually did a "sudo yum install node" waay back when
[16:44] mscdex: johnroach: put /usr/local/bin earlier in your $PATH
[16:44] johnroach: mscdex, how can i do that?
[16:44] mscdex: to give it priority or uninstall the ax25-apps package maybe

[16:46] tmedema: squeeks: how come? and I'm not going to serve them, I'm going to proxy mp3 streams from one client to another

[17:24] sleeplessinc: Guys, I think my facebook game server is getting enough traffic that the heap is maxing out and GC is starting to eat up a lot of cpu on my aws instances.  is there a way to increase the amount of memory that v8 can consume?  I thought I heard ryan say that heap size had a hard limit of 2G or something like that.  can I increase it in the v8 src somewhere?

[17:27] mikegerwitz: sleeplessinc: Have you done any profiling to ensure that GC is indeed the problem?
[17:27] guybrush: another way is to use multiple node-processes

[20:32] mscdex: someone with a similar problem a couple months ago said they ended up using a different gcc/g++ instead of ccache
[20:32] lluad: Ah, that might be it...
[20:33] mscdex: i guess they manually set CC and such

[20:36] chapel: caolanm: general js?
[20:36] caolanm: chapel: yeah
[20:36] tjholowaychuk: EvanCarroll: you can build on the basics that express gives you with stuff like this https://github.com/visionmedia/express-resource
[20:36] tjholowaychuk: or like he has there
[20:36] caolanm: for someone without a programming background
[20:36] tjholowaychuk: but it's not a good base

[20:37] tmedema: squeeks: I have been frustrated by this issue for a week now yes 
[20:37] mikegerwitz: tmedema: The audio tag is not meant to play mp3. Regardless, mp3 is a patent-encumbered codec and not suitable for the web.
[20:37] jtp8419: caolanm: did you see http://eloquentjavascript.net ?  no pics but interactive console with it
[20:37] EvanCarroll: tjholowaychuk: what will router be replaced with?
[20:37] tjholowaychuk: nothing
[20:37] mscdex: caolanm: googling "fun javascript tutorial" gives this: http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/JavaScript_Tutorial_-_Lesson_1/
[20:37] mscdex: heh
[20:37] squeeks: tmedema: then instead of messing around, start eliminating causes and find the 
[20:37] EvanCarroll: tjholowaychuk: so the end user will have to pick the router they want?
[20:37] squeeks: err, stupid enter key. ... and find the root cause.
[20:37] tmedema: mikegerwitz: as far as I know, chrome should be able to play mp3
[20:37] tjholowaychuk: EvanCarroll: yeah, connect is not meant to be used on it's own really
[20:38] tmedema: and while it may not be the best for the web it is what people normally use, and since products serve to satisfy consumers I'll have to adept
[20:38] EvanCarroll: tjholowaychuk: so how will two Express apps be integrated if they use different routers?
[20:38] EvanCarroll: FCFS?
[20:38] tjholowaychuk: express has it's own router
[20:38] nphase: anyone know of an easy way to parse the string "user.id" to see if an actual var object exists with id set?
[20:38] nphase: erm, wrong channel sry :) thought i was in ##javascript
[20:39] EvanCarroll: right. i thought that was called "router" which I thought you were telling me won't be there in the future
[20:39] caolanm: jtp8419: oh! eloquent javascript, forgot about that :)
[20:39] tjholowaychuk: EvanCarroll: it was, but I've moved it to Express and have started refactoring it
[20:39] tjholowaychuk: but yeah it will be gone in connect 2.0

[20:39] EvanCarroll: oh so connect's router is going to be moved to be express's router?
[20:40] tmedema: squeeks: I just noticed that it accepts the headers, and then 2 more chunks of binary data.. then I get "Error: ECONNRESET, Connection reset by peer" - then, the client (audio tag) requests the same URL again, and this time 57 chunks are accepted before the same error occurs.. same happens every time.
[20:41] EvanCarroll: the question still remains then, if you're just moving the code out of the middleware layer into Express, will we have pluggable routing? and, will that be the vanilla routing syntax, or the resource-router routing syntax (which I find much more pleasing and better for structuring an app)
[20:41] squeeks: tmedema: Look. You're not actually finding the cause. You're banging your head against the wall.

[20:41] tjholowaychuk: EvanCarroll: like I said, some may find that nicer to work with but it's bad for a base api

[20:45] EvanCarroll: tjholowaychuk: your argument is because the app becomes dependent on god-object at a very high level?
[20:45] tjholowaychuk: my argument is that it's irrelvant, because you can use the current api to build anything else
[20:46] tjholowaychuk: which is the important thing
[20:46] tjholowaychuk: ultimately it's a method and a pathname
[20:47] EvanCarroll: that argument, is valid only insofar as any argument about "defaults" is. "If the default $foo is bad, change it it's a default!"

[20:51] bingomanatee: ACTION <3 express
[20:52] EvanCarroll: tjholowaychuk: internally, express resolves the HTTP verb before resolving the resource?
[20:52] tjholowaychuk: EvanCarroll: both come into play yes, express does not know of a "resource" it's simply a method and pathname mapped to a callback
[20:53] EvanCarroll: right resource being url path component.
[20:54] tjholowaychuk: soonish once i refactor the router i'll have a better reflection api so these higher level routers can have an easier time inspecting existing routes etc
[20:54] tjholowaychuk: but it's still pretty easy to do right now
[20:54] EvanCarroll: I agree it's easy to do man, please... I'm just trying to pick your brain so I have an idea of how express works.
[20:54] EvanCarroll: and, why it works that way.
[20:54] tjholowaychuk: because it's simple :D and I like simple

[20:56] dgathright has joined the channel
[20:56] tjholowaychuk: but if you had a router that was conceptually very different you could still utilize it with express and just ignore app.router etc
[20:56] tjholowaychuk: or use both etc
[20:56] EvanCarroll: tjholowaychuk: I'm not trying to be thick, I don't understand why your way is "simple" or any more "simple" than a way that sounds more right, and logical, and would lead to better code organization =(
[20:57] siculars has joined the channel
[20:57] tjholowaychuk: yeah but you could say that about rails
[20:57] tjholowaychuk: just because it is organized does not mean it's simple nor low level
[20:57] tjholowaychuk: im saying you can take app.VERB() and do anything with it
[20:57] tjholowaychuk: if you start with something high level you cannot (easily) break it down for other cases
[20:58] EvanCarroll: Rather than reading the http header for the verb, and then using an internal dispatch table for the path, why not go right to the path/resource -- and then optionally subdispatch on *any* header value whatsoever... or in this case, namely verb.
[20:58] tjholowaychuk: sure we could force path: { GET: callback } on people but it's essentially no different than app.get(path, callback)
[20:58] tjholowaychuk: gah
[20:58] tjholowaychuk: lol
[20:58] EvanCarroll: the *only* time verb comes before path in importance or otherwise, is if you're manually typing the request `(1) GET (2) <resource>`
[20:59] fyskij has joined the channel
[20:59] EvanCarroll: tjholowaychuk: it's actually massively different in the code organization with the core router, and no more conceptually difficult or more complex at the core level.
[20:59] tjholowaychuk: routing would be identical for that
[20:59] EvanCarroll: and presumably, it makes collisisions on paths harder to detect -- which sounds bothersome.
[20:59] tjholowaychuk: s/would/could/
[21:00] tjholowaychuk: it's just an implementation detail, there is no reason the router could not internally produce a map of [pathname] = { methods }
[21:00] tjholowaychuk: instead of the current [method] = { pathnames }
[21:00] davidcoallier has joined the channel
[21:00] bingomanatee: TJ: when you redirect from a POST, does the redirect also get treated as a POST?
[21:00] tjholowaychuk: really doesn't matter
[21:01] EvanCarroll: bingomanatee: that depends on the http code.
[21:01] tjholowaychuk: bingomanatee: that's really up to the client
[21:01] EvanCarroll: bingomanatee: I just patched request to handle this btw.
[21:01] tjholowaychuk: bingomanatee: it can do whatever it wants with the redirect really
[21:01] bingomanatee: ....
[21:01] EvanCarroll: that isn't true, it's speced out.
[21:02] EvanCarroll: for the 1.1 verbs, http 307 can redirect as a POST with *user permission*. http 303 *must* redirect modifying the verb to GET
[21:03] bingomanatee: Okay lets try this again ... by default - assuming I use express without any special mods - I handle a POST of data and want to redirect to /foo/ + data._id which is normally handled as a GET
[21:03] EvanCarroll: for http 302 in 1.0 it *must* not change verbs, and it must not autoredirect -- this is often broken in clients, which tend to impliment it in http1.0 as an http1.1 303, and automagically redirect.
[21:03] tjholowaychuk: bingomanatee: like i said though that is up to the client
[21:03] tjholowaychuk: express doesn't say "hey redirect me with this method"
[21:03] bingomanatee: okay I may not be understanding what your use of the word "client" means - 
[21:03] EvanCarroll: express has no control over what the clients do, but the spec is supposed to govern the clients -- we can only answer this question with what the clients *should* do.
[21:04] tjholowaychuk: bingomanatee: browser
[21:04] bingomanatee: okay. 
[21:04] bingomanatee: I am starting to understand. 
[21:04] jamesarosen has joined the channel
[21:05] bingomanatee: So redirection simply sends headers and commands to the browser.
[21:05] EvanCarroll: right.
[21:06] tjholowaychuk: they get a 3xx status code
[21:06] bingomanatee: and there is no absolute guarantee of whether the browser will redirect as a POST or a GET under this circumstance.
[21:06] tjholowaychuk: and Location
[21:06] bnoordhuis has joined the channel
[21:06] EvanCarroll: A status code, and a Location, and a Body in the case of a 302
[21:06] bingomanatee: so I need to research how that status code is interpreteted by browsers. 
[21:06] EvanCarroll: I just told you....
[21:06] EvanCarroll: If the client receives a 307 redirect in response to a POST request, it should reissue the request as a POST, if you want it to redirect as a GET, issue a 303 instead. If the client doesn't support http 1.1, you *must* use 302 which tends to effectively work as a 303
[21:07] tjholowaychuk: i believe they can all have bodies
[21:07] bingomanatee: Yes you did. 
[21:07] bingomanatee: sorry - getting a lot of cross feedback here. 
[21:07] squeeks: all of them? 301 usually baulks at it
[21:07] admc1 has joined the channel
[21:08] tjholowaychuk: should be fine
[21:08] bingomanatee: so does the redirect command include a redirect code as a parameter?
[21:08] tjholowaychuk: curl -X HEAD -i google.com
[21:08] tjholowaychuk: gets a 301 with a body
[21:08] ruquay has joined the channel
[21:08] tjholowaychuk: minus the body there haha but content-length
[21:09] sorl has joined the channel
[21:09] EvanCarroll: bingomanatee: https://github.com/mikeal/request/issues/29
[21:09] EvanCarroll: if you want to read more about redirects
[21:09] bingomanatee: right - status - so I can permute to a redirect GET or redirect POST etc. by changing the second parameter of response.redirect.
[21:10] tjholowaychuk: the client is simply told where to redirect to, but it's up to the client to take a look at the http method
[21:10] tjholowaychuk: and act accordingly
[21:10] tjholowaychuk: in that case node is the client since it's performing the request
[21:11] bingomanatee: Thanks everyone for the help. 
[21:11] bingomanatee: okay so response.redirect sends a command back to node - which is the client. 
[21:12] bene1 has joined the channel
[21:12] bingomanatee: so node - not the browser - interprets the redirect, according to node core code?
[21:12] swaj has joined the channel
[21:12] tjholowaychuk: res.redirect() is just a convenience method all it really does is provide a default body, set the status code and Location

[21:15] tjholowaychuk: simply because
[21:16] EvanCarroll: it'll be fun, and ultimately it's no more complex and I believe conceptually better.
[21:16] EvanCarroll: app.all() becomes the default.
[21:16] tjholowaychuk: say for example "/user/:id" is your concentual "resource" most applications still consider say "/user/:id/edit" to still be part of that resource, however if you reverse the mapping this is harder to lookup
[21:17] stephank has joined the channel
[21:17] tjholowaychuk: i know it sounds like the obvious thing to do

[21:18] EvanCarroll: if you only had an http server that accepted GET, you'd solve that problem (which must already be solved), and you'd be done.

[21:19] jmoyers: is it bad practice? assuming reasonably small objects
[21:19] squeeks: a bad idea in production.
[21:19] jmoyers: because of syslog?
[21:20] jmoyers: it doesn't like newlines or some such, i assume
[21:20] squeeks: well, yeah, syslog doesn't support newlines.
[21:20] EvanCarroll: because it typically implies *I was to lazy to put this in Reddis*

[21:22] tilgovi has joined the channel
[21:22] bingomanatee: well if you have multiline comments in any other context it doesn't make a difference. A line break in a SQL / Mongo/ REDIS field is a nonissue. 
[21:23] bingomanatee: If you have already encased a comment in a field of some sort than the question really doesn't have any import. 
[21:23] mauritslamers has joined the channel
[21:24] jmoyers: uh
[21:24] squeeks: multiline logs are a problem in syslog because the RFC's do not permit them, since \n is used to terminate the message.
[21:24] jmoyers: well look, something like splunk for instance
[21:24] jmoyers: i dont think handles multi-line logging very well either
[21:24] jmoyers: logging to a database is... 
[21:24] bingomanatee: I would suggest - if you have spare cycles to structure your logs at all - to at least YAML them. Then you can have any data you like in comments. 
[21:24] squeeks: YAML...

[21:25] EvanCarroll: YAML is a human-readable JSON variant

[21:26] ruquay: mauritslamers: e.g. Array.prototype.newfunc = function() {...} ?

[21:26] mauritslamers: but when I open the REPL, nothing has changed
[21:26] bingomanatee: Couch is probably just as good, and REDIS is probably best of all, as long as you harvest the REDIS repo to a static system once in a while. 
[21:26] ruquay: mauritslamers: leave "global." off.
[21:26] jmoyers: what about something like winston?
[21:26] squeeks: bingomanatee: you've not worked in devops or sysadmin before, have you?
[21:27] mAritz has joined the channel
[21:27] jmoyers: ^^
[21:27] bingomanatee: However I would point out that the point of logging is to find out why your server violently died, and if you are storing your log data on said machine, a memory resident logging system will not tell you anything. 
[21:27] jmoyers: my it dude would shoot me in the face if i said i was logging to a database
[21:27] bingomanatee: I've been an "Ad hoc " sysadmin for a year. Not much fun. 
[21:27] mauritslamers: ruquay: doesn't make any difference
[21:27] ruquay: mauritslamers: one of the first things i usually do is include a file that adds the function prototype, as in Function.prototype.curry = function(){..}
[21:27] ruquay: it's always worked for me in the past.
[21:27] squeeks: bingomanatee: well, that makes sense.
[21:28] bingomanatee: Like I said - a database is one of 6 options I suggested for logging - DB, Mongo, Redis, Couch, YAML, Flat File.

[21:28] jmoyers: newline or no
[21:28] mauritslamers: ruquay: I will, trying out your suggestion first in a few different ways :)
[21:29] bingomanatee: For instance, a replicated Mongo set, with one repl on the host system and one remotely, works nifty, and is quite fast. 
[21:29] ruquay: mauritslamers: i do this... require("./prototypes.js")
[21:29] squeeks: jmoyers: oh hey, I've not seen winston before.
[21:29] bingomanatee: But if you are stuck in file logging mode, I'd suggest that a token like <-- break --> works just as well as a newline system. 
[21:29] jmoyers: im evaluating it here
[21:29] ruquay: mauritslamers: and in that file, i start directly with Function.prototype.newfunc ... and so on.
[21:30] jmoyers: i see a few mentions of syslog; it says its multi transport but...
[21:30] jmoyers: https://github.com/indexzero/winston/blob/master/lib/winston/transports.js
[21:30] jmoyers: this is all i see so far

[21:30] bingomanatee: You could use loggly.com and outsource the problem :D
[21:30] jmoyers: tokenizing might work if i controlled the reader
[21:30] jmoyers: squeeks: i'll check it out
[21:31] bingomanatee: "Let someone else do it"
[21:31] jmoyers: well i mean
[21:31] jmoyers: the main problem is there IS infrastructure in place
[21:31] jmoyers: i.e. syslogd rolls up to a logging server
[21:31] mauritslamers: ruquay: it seems to work in the code itself indeed... strangely enough that doesn't have any influence on the REPL

[21:33] jmoyers: im logging because.. i don't want to die a painful death :-)
[21:33] bingomanatee: right. 
[21:33] nexxy: I log therefore I am.
[21:33] ruquay: mauritslamers: sorry about that, i rarely ever use the repl for more than a few moments of time
[21:34] jmoyers: i try to avoid "IM OKAY" type logging, but im not doing anything fancy. i dont have a bunch of time to parse custom output i guess
[21:34] bingomanatee: So what I am getting at ... having a redundant log of structured data for request / response, for instance, in a couch/Mongo repo, might be useful on top of a general purpose "All and everything" log. 
[21:34] mauritslamers: ruquay: normally me too, but in this case it is helpful to try out some little things, and in this case I tried to see what was happening
[21:34] squeeks: bingomanatee: Stop being so ignorant, please, I've got no alcohol and you're grinding my gears
[21:34] bingomanatee: So for instance you can query your noSQL DB for sesion centric data, url centric data, post/put centric data....
[21:34] bingomanatee: Questions cannot by definition be ignorant. 
[21:35] jmoyers: i guess if i was more comfortable with a repl and writing queries than i was with grep
[21:35] bingomanatee: and I'm not paid to help you so I don't care what you feel.
[21:35] jmoyers: if i was going to do something fancy and put a viewer of some sort over the top, i might
[21:35] jmoyers: but splunk seems to do a pretty good job of that, thus far
[21:36] bingomanatee: right. 
[21:37] bingomanatee: so circling back to your question - that of returns in logs - there is no harm in filtering the log data to replace returns with a text token like <-- break --> and it could do some good.

[21:38] squeeks: Well, yes there is a harm because the bigger problem then becomes the size of the message. If it's syslog, he's got a payload limit
[21:38] ruquay: mauritslamers: yes, i just played around with the repl in that case, i have the same issue.
[21:38] bingomanatee: Since you already wrote off my suggestion of non-text storage I assume that performance is not a problem :D
[21:39] bingomanatee: for instance, Couch is built for storing binary data in hunks along with formatted data in JSON so that solves the problem nicely. 
[21:40] ablohowiak has joined the channel
[21:40] bingomanatee: If you intend to reduce the possible solution set to a single binary block of data you can't turn around and bitch at me that your single binary block of data has performance issues.

[21:40] jmoyers: im saying

[21:41] bingomanatee: I spent the last year dealing with tetrabytes of log data for a security company so I think I have a bit of a handle on the general issue of system logging. 
[21:41] ablohowiak: anyone know why http://isaacs.couchone.com/registry/_changes?since=4475 would work but http://registry.npmjs.org/_changes doesn't ?
[21:41] bingomanatee: Just becuase you have to use one particular logging solution doesn't mean you can't use that one AND one that works, redundantly.

[21:42] bingomanatee: When the company approved logging system breaks, your secondary logging system kicks in and saves the day and you look brilliant.

[23:45] bingomanatee: ACTION wishes IRC had audio so he could share the joy of angry men yelling at each other with his peers. 
[23:45] bingomanatee: .(outside his window)
[23:45] techwraith: gm__: I don't know much about the other options out there for ws
[23:45] Guest154 has left the channel
[23:45] techwraith: but I do know that socket.io just got a huge update (channels, custom events, etc.)
[23:46] carter_ has joined the channel
[23:46] gm__: can you force it to be websockets only ?
[23:46] mdwright_laptop has left the channel
[23:47] techwraith: gm__: yes, but why?
[23:47] techwraith: ws aren't exactly reliable yet
[23:48] gm__: techwraith: been reliable enough for me... I want to avoid long polling, xhr, ajax, etc
[23:48] gm__: that's why I've been using node.ws.js
[23:48] techwraith: gm__: But why avoid them?
[23:49] gm__: techwraith: I find them slow, and messy actually
[23:49] gm__: I really need what ws gives me
[23:49] techwraith: When it's all abstracted from you, it doesn't matter what transport you're using, it all just works
[23:49] gm__: nothing else
[23:49] gm__: techwraith: I appreciate the work behind the abstraction.
[23:49] techwraith: alright man, it just seems like you want to use ws just because they're ws...
[23:50] gm__: techwraith: ;)
[23:50] techwraith: :)
[23:50] gm__: http://editor.7co.cc
[23:50] gm__: it is not the same w/o ws, but I'm using my own server instead of socket.io

[23:51] Qbix2: do you have any answers to these two concerns?
[23:51] eee_c has joined the channel
[23:51] techwraith: Yeah, this would not really work with long polling (but it would work on ws or flash sockets)
[23:51] techwraith: gm__: ^
[23:51] dhasenan has joined the channel
[23:51] gm__: techwraith: ~
[23:52] ddsf has joined the channel
[23:52] techwraith: gm__: So then I'd recommend using socket.io and limiting the transports to ws and flash
[23:52] gm__: techwraith: y, I'm lokking into the docs again to check this and channels
[23:52] gm__: tks
[23:53] dyer has joined the channel
[23:53] techwraith: gm__: Then again, you might as well use long polling too, it won't be as fast, but it will be usable, and it would try to use ws and flash first, so it would really only fall back to long polling on really crappy browsers
[23:53] techwraith: but it would still work

[23:54] n2liquid: can anyone point me to any attempts to write graphical desktop applications using node?
[23:54] n2liquid: for some reason it appears creating a window messes up with node's main loop
[23:54] ddsf: is there any addslashes (php) equal function ?
[23:55] ddsf: in javascript of course
[23:55] techwraith: I think someone was working on a webkit frontend/node backed desktop app framework...
[23:55] ddsf: i need to insert " or ' to db..
[23:55] techwraith: n2liquid: ^
[23:55] tobmaster has joined the channel
[23:56] n2liquid: interesting
[23:56] techwraith: ddsf: js doesn't have one, you'll have to use replace
[23:56] n2liquid: I'll try looking that up, but links would be cool
[23:56] ddsf: techwraith, i'm not familiar much with regex. can somebody help me on it :)
[23:57] ddsf: ?
