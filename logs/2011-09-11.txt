[00:50] creationix: pquerna: just playing around with binding libuv to luajit
[00:51] creationix: pquerna: but as normally happens, make and gcc kick my butt
[00:52] pquerna: creationix: ah;  well, lua and luajit should have the same link requirements....
[00:52] creationix: hmm, so maybe -llua and not -lluajit?
[00:53] pquerna: well, depends on what you want.....
[00:53] creationix: I'm not sure what I want
[00:53] pquerna: luajit is link comptaible with lua
[00:53] pquerna: k
[00:53] creationix: how does node do it?
[00:54] creationix: I want to be able to dlopen addons later, but staticly embed luajit into my binary
[00:54] pquerna: 'dl', 'pthread'
[00:54] pquerna: is what I link for lua... 
[00:54] pquerna: right
[00:54] pquerna: so
[00:54] pquerna: you don't want -static
[00:54] pquerna: is it a libluajit.a ?
[00:54] pquerna: if there is only a static archive available

[02:23] der| has joined the channel
[02:24] der|: To the gurus out there, do you think using UUIDs as SessionIDs is viable ?
[02:26] pquerna: der|: no, its a very very bad idea
[02:26] der|: I'm not quite clear on the probabilities of a duplicate
[02:26] der|: pquerna: yeah, I'm orbiting around that conclusion, they're quite big
[02:26] creationix: pquerna: lua <-> libuv, I don't plan on interfacing with node within the process
[02:26] pquerna: its not about duplication;  its about an attacker being able to predict a UUID, and therefore hijack a session
[02:26] pquerna: if you know the timestamp of when someone logged in
[02:27] der|: what if you use some sort of algorithm to return a random hash based on the user agent ?
[02:27] pquerna: their UUID, if its a type 1 or such, is actually in a quite small range
[02:27] pquerna: no
[02:27] pquerna: just make a 64 character random string
[02:27] der|: ah ok
[02:27] der|: 2 md5's maybe ?
[02:27] pquerna: ignoring the fact that you don't have secure random number generator available to you
[02:27] pquerna: no
[02:27] der|: or just a 64 byte string
[02:27] pquerna: the best thing probally
[02:28] pquerna: is to read /dev/urandom
[02:28] pquerna: and generate 64 chars from there
[02:28] creationix: assuming you had a good random number generator, it's easy to just generate enough bytes
[02:28] pquerna: right
[02:28] pquerna: the problem is
[02:28] pquerna: math.random isn't... that.
[02:28] der|: what's the lowest level of second precision node provides
[02:28] der|: microseconds ?
[02:29] dnyy has joined the channel
[02:29] creationix: what's the diff between /dev/random and /dev/urandom other than /dev/urandom spits out data a lot faster
[02:29] smathy has joined the channel
[02:29] pquerna: /dev/random is actually secure
[02:29] pquerna: /dev/urandom hashes over your available entropy, so it never 'runs out'
[02:29] bbttxu has joined the channel
[02:30] pquerna: but its not actually using up entropy
[02:30] pquerna: so its... 'non blcoking' -ish
[02:30] stonecobra: derj: answer is platform dependent
[02:30] pquerna: /dev/random on the hand, will just plain drop
[02:30] pquerna: *block
[02:30] pquerna: if you are out of entropy
[02:30] pquerna: but, its splitting hairs
[02:30] pquerna: for a session id
[02:30] pquerna: i'd use /dev/urandom
[02:30] pquerna: at least if i'm not a bank
[02:31] der|: I haven't used /dev/urandom before, I made the big mistake to cat it heh, had to close the term (osx)
[02:31] stonecobra: if you need microsecond precision, 'npm install microtime' and then require('microtime').now() for microsecond precision
[02:31] pquerna: well, I mean, you could just do what connect does
[02:31] der|: what's that
[02:31] der|: stonecobra: thanks for that :)
[02:32] stonecobra: derj: no problem
[02:32] stonecobra: s/j/|/g
[02:32] pquerna: https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/master/lib/middleware/session.js#L232
[02:33] pquerna: its... actually ba.
[02:33] pquerna: d
[02:33] pquerna: anyways.
[02:33] pquerna: well, not tht bad
[02:33] der|: thanks for that
[02:33] pquerna: assuming your secret is good
[02:34] pquerna: just make your secret another large, completely random, string
[02:34] der|: 64 bytes would suffice too ?
[02:34] der|: for performance reasons I mean, it might get computationally intensive
[02:34] pquerna: sure
[02:34] pquerna: not really
[02:34] pquerna: the internet is slow, cpus are fast
[02:34] der|: true
[02:35] pquerna: plus, one round of a sha256 is such complete noise compared to the rest of TLS :)

[05:29] creationix: that's ages in uv time
[05:29] chjj has joined the channel
[05:30] creationix: anyone online who's currently working with libuv?
[05:31] jakehow has joined the channel
[05:31] chjj: creationix: why not node.lua?
[05:31] creationix: chjj: dunno, luanode rolls of the tongue better
[05:31] creationix: though the name is already taken too
[05:31] chjj: ah
[05:32] chjj: well, i hope it goes well, ive always thought a lua version of node would be amazing
[05:32] creationix: well, don't know if I'll get to amazing, but it will be  a fun experiment
[05:32] chjj: :)
[05:32] brainproxy: creationix: how do your goals for it differ from the scope of the LuaNode project
[05:32] creationix: I've got 14 lines of c code and 26 lines of makefile and it's still not working
[05:33] chjj: haha, its gotta start somewhere
[05:33] creationix: brainproxy: my main goal is to learn
[05:33] creationix: if it's useful to others that's a nice side effect
[05:33] tjgillies: i just pushed telemail, telehash based messaging lib: https://github.com/tjgillies/telemail/blob/master/sendmail.js http://telehash.org
[05:33] creationix: also the existing luanode is using some crazy C++ library
[05:33] creationix: I'd rather use libuv 
[05:34] creationix: Boost.asio or something like that
[05:34] creationix: I was never a fan of anything Boost
[05:34] brainproxy: gotcha, just curious; Lua seems like an interesting language; I read a paper about a functional reactive library called LuaGravity, which helped me understand the concepts as they would relate to Javascript too
[05:35] brainproxy: but I never went any farther than to just learn some syntax so I could read the paper
[05:35] creationix: Also a lua based node would appeal less to web developers and more to game developers which is where I've been taking node lately
[05:35] tjgillies: LuaTeX ftw ;)
[05:35] chjj: honestly, i think anyone who appreciates javascript would definitely appreciate lua
[05:35] ptlo has joined the channel
[05:35] fairwinds has left the channel
[05:35] tjgillies: plus lua is tail call optimized ;)
[05:35] brainproxy: creationix: might also appeal to embedded Lua hackers
[05:35] chjj: haha
[05:36] brainproxy: there's a thing called eLUa
[05:36] brainproxy: eLua
[05:36] chjj: yeah, lua is partially javascript minus the bad parts
[05:36] brainproxy: which is like lua for arduino scale things
[05:36] creationix: heh, I'm supposed to get an arduino kit for winning innovation for nko
[05:36] brainproxy: http://www.eluaproject.net/
[05:36] creationix: one of my use cases is opengl games on webos
[05:37] creationix: brainproxy: nice site
[05:37] brainproxy: "like lua" wasn't a good way to put it .. I mean it's a subset of Lua which is ported specifically to run on embeddable architectures
[05:38] creationix: oh neat
[05:38] creationix: I'll play when that when I get my kit.  Can't hurt with learning lua
[05:39] brainproxy: I'm not sure how much crossover there is between eLua compatible boards and arduino boards
[05:40] brainproxy: but if you can get a node-a-like library running well on an embeddable platform, I think you'll have come up with something very cool indeed
[05:40] creationix: brainproxy: It's not exactly embedded, but I've been playing with node on webos smartphones for the last year
[05:41] creationix: 1.5GHz dual core armv7 with 1Gb of ram is hardly what's considered embedded
[05:41] brainproxy: sure, I've been following your webgl stuff, congrats on the ko win btw
[05:41] creationix: thanks
[05:42] creationix: anyway, back to reading uv.h since there seem to be no other resources
[05:42] creationix: at least it's somewhat commented
[05:43] brainproxy: have fun
[05:43] Nexxy: I just got 3 beagleboards
[05:43] springmeyer has joined the channel
[05:43] Nexxy: that I will be putting node on eventually ;3

[05:44] creationix: those are fun
[05:45] creationix: about the same power of my devices
[05:45] Nexxy: creationix, ya! I'm excited
[05:45] creationix: same class at least
[05:45] Nexxy: we were originally going to use pandaboards but they were nowhere to be had
[05:45] Nexxy: waited 2 months trying to get some from mouser & svtronics
[05:45] creationix: if you can get an ubuntu chroot running on the device, it's trivial to build node there
[05:45] creationix: ports.ubuntu.com
[05:45] Nexxy: I'm sure I will come crying for help soon
[05:46] creationix: I wrote up an article on howtonode.org
[05:46] creationix: latest one I think
[05:46] Nexxy: this is my first foray into ARM/embedded

[06:35] JaKWaC: What kind of chat app do you want markwk?
[06:35] creationix: markwk: it's not wasteful, it's like 5 lines of code after using a library like socket.io
[06:36] creationix: especially if you just want a single large chat room where everyone broadcasts to everyone
[06:37] creationix: every program is unique, the libraries exist to help with the common and hard parts and then user is expected to write the easier and more interesting parts

[07:17] kiffness has joined the channel
[07:18] ErikCorryV8_: Basically saying you shouldn't feel bad about using urandom.
[07:18] ErikCorryV8_: The only reason to use /dev/random was if you don't trust the secure hash that the kernel is using to generate urandom
[07:19] ErikCorryV8_: But if you don't trust cryptographic secure hashes you might as well give up right now, because they are the basis of so much other stuff.

[07:26] ErikCorryV8_: In node I don't see why you wouldn't just use urandom
[07:26] ErikCorryV8_: In the browser it's not easy to do crypto.
[07:26] Nuck: ErikCorryV8_: I'm bcrypting in the server, and mersenne is one of my random sources.
[07:26] ErikCorryV8_: Most of the time the answer is to use https and offload it to the server.

[07:28] Nuck: Try and find my seed NOW
[07:29] Nuck: ErikCorryV8_: Aye, but as one of 4 random salts, it's not gonna make it less secure ;)
[07:29] kiffness has joined the channel
[07:29] ErikCorryV8_: All 3 together -> less secure than just reading from /dev/urandom
[07:29] Nuck: as an ONLY salt, yes
[07:30] Nuck: Meh
[07:30] Nuck: I've got too many salts I ain't adding another
[07:30] Nuck: I'm already overkill on security haha
[07:30] Nuck: 4-salt bcrypt is basically guaranteed to be secure

[08:37] Skola: I'd have the same problem in JS
[08:37] Skola: it doesn't evaluate key, it just reads it AS THE KEY
[08:37] AvianFlu: in JS you can 100% do obj[key] and have it use the value
[08:38] Skola: yeah sure
[08:38] japj: Skola, ah you want "id"?

[17:21] isaacs: dseif: 0.5.6 is broken, i guess
[17:21] dseif: i tried 0.4.11
[17:21] isaacs: dseif: try rolling back to 0.5.5
[17:21] isaacs: or 0.4.11
[17:21] dseif: same issue
[17:21] isaacs: dseif: i don't believe you actually were using 0.4.11, then
[17:21] isaacs: at *least* you'd have a different error.
[17:22] dseif: i try doing git checkout and so on again
[17:22] isaacs: not the same one, because the code where that assertion is being made does not exist in 0.4.11
[17:22] dseif: doh
[17:22] isaacs: dseif: right, but when you ran node, you were getting 0.5.6.  try `node --version`
[17:22] dseif: i will try again, thanks

[17:30] polotek: LordMetroid: option B

[17:30] perezd has joined the channel
[17:30] LordMetroid: ok, cool
[17:30] perezd: question, is it bad form to augment the process global object with something like a logging utility ?
[17:30] JasonSmith: Newbie question but I've never asked: When I refer to it, should I say Node, NodeJS, or Node.js? Is it just tomato/tomato?
[17:31] LordMetroid: polotek: How come, I am executing the cache.loadView() function after all.
[17:31] pandeiro_ has joined the channel
[17:31] LordMetroid: Shouldn't the program wait till that function is fully executed before it does the next line which return the object?
[17:32] polotek: LordMetroid: No, that is how node differs from most other programming environments
[17:32] polotek: all i/o is non-blocking (with a few exceptions)
[17:32] polotek: so you have to manage your control flow with callbacks
[17:33] polotek: It takes some getting used to, but it keeps things fast
[17:33] polotek: JasonSmith: any of those is fine
[17:33] polotek: when googling I find that node.js works best
[17:33] polotek: people usually refer to it that way at least once
[17:34] polotek: perezd: not bad form exactly. but there are definitely "better" ways
[17:34] JasonSmith: Erlang is a beautiful lady. Node.js is a beautiful ladyboy.
[17:34] perezd: such as?
[17:34] JasonSmith: Correct usage?
[17:34] polotek: put your logging utility in it's own module, and require it
[17:35] perezd: polotek: then you'd be setting up transports and stuff every require?
[17:35] LordMetroid: I love both Erlang and JavaScript
[17:35] perezd: LordMetroid: +1
[17:35] LordMetroid: I feel like I get more done with JavaScript though
[17:35] polotek: perezd: no, module requiring is cached
[17:35] JasonSmith: polotek: I believe what you see with a lot of logging modules out there is they take advantage of the module being effectively a singleton, so you do e.g. require('log4js').getLogger('my_component')
[17:35] polotek: you get back the same object, it does not run the script again
[17:36] perezd: oh interesting
[17:36] polotek: JasonSmith: the logo says node.js, but I think the official name is just "node"
[17:36] JasonSmith: polotek: the front-page of the web site says "Node"
[17:36] perezd: polotek: so why is that better than augmenting process?
[17:36] CrabDude has joined the channel

[17:37] polotek: perezd: less chance of collisions, easier to trace the origin

[17:38] perezd: is it bad form to have a simple javascript object with a bunch of functions attached to it? ie: not relying on porototype.
[17:39] perezd: I just have a bag of stateless functions basically, they are loosely related in use case, but otherwise don't share internal state
[17:40] dseif: this may sound like a stupid question, but how do i revert to 0.4.11
[17:40] dseif: i am apparently doing this wrong
[17:41] clifton has joined the channel
[17:41] JasonSmith: perezd: My impression is getting things done is the top priority. If you write useful code, people will not take too much offense at your style. Performance-wise, I don't think it matters except in special circumstances which will be obvious when they happen

[18:08] marcello3d: are there any docs on the diffs between 0.4 and 0.5?
[18:08] rhdoenges: cjm: gotcha :D
[18:08] aaronblohowiak: marcello3d: 0.5 is unstable! Thar be dragons (like npm might not work and izs will tell you to go and use stable)

[18:28] marcello3d: cause 100 users total is pretty much nothing...I would just go with whatever database you prefer the API with/most comfortable with
[18:28] Raynos: Tobbe__: Turned out we stored in couch & redis : https://github.com/Raynos/so642/blob/master/src/model/users.js
[18:28] marcello3d: you can keep 100 users in ram without much trouble
[18:28] Tobbe__: marcello3d: total
[18:28] rhdoenges: go redis
[18:28] bengrue has joined the channel
[18:29] rhdoenges: (that was meant as a cheer not a recommendation)
[18:29] marcello3d: I've personally been using mongo
[18:29] marcello3d: but only experimenting, nothing in production
[18:29] kersny has joined the channel
[18:29] Raynos: I think we used redis for rapid reads
[18:30] Raynos: and couch for views by field names
[18:30] Tobbe__: marcello3d: If I would go with what I'm comfortable with I'd go with mysql...
[18:30] Raynos: We also set some flags in redis and extracted user meta data from redis
[18:31] Raynos: But mysql is so not node :(
[18:31] trupppOFF: :D

[18:31] Raynos: I'd recommend avoiding it unless you have an existing database
[18:31] marcello3d: nothing wrong with using mysql. if you're using it already you don't have to worry about the operational aspects
[18:31] Tobbe__: Raynos: I know, that's why I asked :)
[18:32] marcello3d: you certainly won't have performance problems, and if you're new to node.js it's a good stepping off point
[18:32] c4milo1 has joined the channel
[18:32] Tobbe__: I'm not using anyhing atm
[18:32] Tobbe__: have't written the app yet :)
[18:32] Raynos: Just setup couch, redis or mongo
[18:32] marcello3d: go look at redis, riak, mongo and couch
[18:32] marcello3d: they're all different
[18:32] marcello3d: API-wise and purpose-wise
[18:32] Raynos: riak is less popular but also do-able
[18:33] marcello3d: see what clicks with you most
[18:33] marcello3d: mongo will probably be the closest to mysql of the bunch
[18:33] marcello3d: (as far as querying goes)
[18:33] Raynos: I'd also recommend couchbase 2 if it wasnt in private beta ;)
[18:33] rmzg: Yay mongo!
[18:33] Raynos: Tobbe__: Redis is just an in memory database, very fast for reading. API is simple setting of keyvalues and doing collections
[18:34] Raynos: CouchDB is a collection of databases with a collection of JSON documents in each. All querying is done over HTTP
[18:34] Tobbe__: when is a relational database better than a document db?
[18:34] Raynos: Mongo is something
[18:34] rmzg: Tobbe__: when you need to perform set algebra
[18:34] Tobbe__: (or the other way around if you prefer)
[18:34] rmzg: =]
[18:34] petrjanda has joined the channel
[18:35] rmzg: Tobbe__: There's essentially two main points. 1) SQL databases tend to be older and thus have more existing development and infrastructure, including training, support, as well as technical features
[18:35] hackband has joined the channel
[18:35] rmzg: 2) SQL databases generally give you much more flexibility *inside* the database
[18:35] marcello3d: sql databases also allow you to separate concerns a bit
[18:35] Raynos: But SQL is a pain in the ass
[18:36] marcello3d: e.g. if you don't trust your app writer, you can put a lot of solid logic in the DB itself
[18:36] Raynos: couch & redis are just done in javascript
[18:36] rmzg: In my, somewhat limited experience, most of the "nosql" databases have very limited facilities for interacting with your data from inside the db
[18:36] Raynos: Which minimizes context switching nicely
[18:36] fcambus has joined the channel
[18:36] marcello3d: rmzg: except mongo
[18:36] Raynos: rmzg: not really, couchdb _utils is quite extensive
[18:36] rmzg: I was specifically thinking of mongo
[18:36] Raynos: I think this "inside the db" is a bit grey
[18:36] rmzg: Sure
[18:36] Raynos: Whether a stored procedure lives on the database or in a js file
[18:37] Raynos: It really doesnt matter to me.
[18:37] rmzg: But it's hard to compare to the ability to write a 45 line sql command 
[18:37] Raynos: I think its great I dont have to faff around with sql
[18:37] patcito has joined the channel
[18:37] Raynos: sql was always a pain for me.
[18:37] Raynos: If your a database engineer it's cool, but if you do client, server & db the context switching is just a pain
[18:38] marcello3d: yea
[18:38] marcello3d: that's why I like the nodejs + mongo combo

[18:40] Tobbe__: rmzg: I like your "when you need to perform set algebra" comment. How serious was that?
[18:41] japj: Raynos: ;)
[18:41] Tobbe__: If I see myself ever needing to do joins, should I go with a relational database?
[18:41] cjm: japj: they are all in person this week, i'm not there but i think the problem is multi-mic mixing 
[18:42] japj: cjm: they are all together in the same room?
[18:42] cjm: japj: yea
[18:42] Raynos: Tobbe__: joins are so generic.
[18:43] Raynos: Thats like saying "If I ever need data that is linked to other data, should I go with a relational database"
[18:43] petrjanda has joined the channel
[18:43] Raynos: Oh you have users, and each user has a forum post or something. I must use a relational database!

[20:01] kiffness has joined the channel
[20:01] ryah: firefox7 is what indexzero said
[20:01] `3rdEden: ryah it's the outgoing connection that doesn't work
[20:02] `3rdEden: FF6 also works fine with incomming connections
[20:02] jroes: there's no words on it!

[20:04] ryah: `3rdEden: oh - i see
[20:05] AvianFlu: hence a pure server doesn't see it, but the proxy, which makes a new outgoing connection with it, is failing
[20:05] AvianFlu: or so it seems

[20:05] `3rdEden: But I also noticed that FF7 doesn't work, but that might be related to socket.io dunno
[20:06] ryah: but outgoing requests don't go through the proxy
[20:06] AvianFlu: ryah: I was saying that the proxy gets a request, and makes an outgoing connection to the place it proxies to
[20:06] `3rdEden: The http proxy makes a outgoing request to proxied server
[20:06] ryah: AvianFlu: oh, i see
[20:07] ryah: so what exactly is failing?
[20:07] ryah: this doesn't sound like a http-parser bug
[20:07] stevie has left the channel
[20:08] ryah: can someone get me the outbound http request and response

[20:32] AvianFlu: `3rdEden the ultimate issue is that the 'upgrade' event on the http.Agent isn't getting fired, right?
[20:33] albertosheinfeld has joined the channel
[20:33] AvianFlu: i.e. the ultimate symptom, I should say
[20:33] `3rdEden: AvianFlu I don't know if it should fire on the http agent
[20:34] smathy has joined the channel
[20:34] `3rdEden: it should just do a HTTP call to the server that emulates the upgrade event
[20:34] AvianFlu: I may be confused on that part, but it's not noticing that it should 'upgrade' somehow, right?
[20:34] `3rdEden: basically the issue if you emulate the latest websocket spec using the HTTP agent it doesn't fire the upgrade event on the http server
[20:35] `3rdEden: where with the old spec it did fire the upgrade event on the server.
[20:35] AvianFlu: right, that's what I thought

[23:28] JaKWaC: CarterA: https://github.com/andyet/fermata
[23:28] nF{: on any well known sites
[23:29] chilts: lots, including LinkedIn, Joyent and various others ... just do a search and you'll find some
[23:30] boogyman: Yahoo, Google, LinkedIn, Joyent, etc..
[23:30] JaKWaC: Yahoo uses NodeJS
[23:30] dynacker: sort of.
[23:31] CarterA: JaKWaC: looks OK. Know of any other options, or is that pretty much it? I tried restler and couldn't get it working.
[23:31] electronplusplus: What part of js should I study in order to understand this -> ( function ( ) { } ) ( );
[23:32] chjj: electronplusplus: the function part :)
[23:32] chjj: thats a function expression
[23:33] joshkehn has joined the channel
[23:33] electronplusplus: ()(); <- this?
[23:33] chjj: electronplusplus: its a self executing function, its usually used to create a new scope
[23:35] JaKWaC: CarterA: https://github.com/maxpert/Reston is simular to Restler
[23:35] joshkehn: So I'm tasked with doing some client side dev and noticed how absolutely horrible it is when you don't have modules or require()
[23:36] joshkehn: Any recommendations for a good library client side for managing code?
[23:36] chjj: joshkehn: the truth!

[23:36] joshkehn: I tried requireJS and haven't like it.
[23:36] gkatsev: they all kind of suck
[23:36] joshkehn: That's not the answer I was hoping for. :p
[23:36] chjj: i prefer to write my own build script that implements a sync require
[23:36] chjj: like node
[23:36] gkatsev: there's also headjs and labjs
[23:37] joshkehn: headjs looked better then anything else I saw.
[23:37] CarterA: I think I'm gonna give https://github.com/franklovecchio/simple-rest-client a shot
[23:37] AvianFlu: joshkehn, try browserify
[23:40] joshkehn: That requires node on the backend, right?
[23:40] joshkehn: I'm trying to keep this backend agnostic.
[23:40] davidbanham has joined the channel
[23:41] AvianFlu: it ports node's require system to the browser, along with a lot of node compatibility stuff
[23:41] AvianFlu: not much for being agnostic, but it certainly gives you a great require() system
[23:41] AvianFlu: you write node code on both ends, basically

[23:42] AvianFlu: so... the opposite for you
[23:42] AvianFlu: lol
[23:42] joshkehn: Yeah. 
[23:42] joshkehn: Really wish there was a better way.
[23:42] joshkehn: I'll look at Browserify and Head.js
[23:42] AvianFlu: amazing how browsers can ruin your day!
[23:42] joshkehn: #tellmeaboutit
[23:43] jesusabdullah: joshkehn: You can compile browserified code and then use it as static content. It's not a well-known feature but it's totally there
[23:43] joshkehn: Hmm. That has potential.
[23:43] jesusabdullah: I mean, there are other solutions that you may like better. I just happen to be most knowledgeable about browserify
[23:44] codely: if I'm using mongoose, and i have an async (figured that part out with next and done). and i have a value called X in my schema, how do i set it?
[23:44] codely: i can use this.get("keyName")
[23:45] codely: but not set...

[23:53] codely: anyone .....
[23:53] joshkehn: this.x = ??
[23:54] joshkehn: Can you better explain the question?
[23:54] codely: nah doesn't save
[23:54] joshkehn: this.markModified('x') ?
[23:55] codely: markmodified is a builst in mongoose func?
[23:55] codely: hmm
[23:55] joshkehn: I have no clue.
[23:55] joshkehn: (about what mongoose is doing under the hood).
[23:55] codely: ahh ok
[23:55] joshkehn: I think it's absurd to build a schema an relationship system in front of mongodb.
