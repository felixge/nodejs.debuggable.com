[00:33] Wa: if you don't plan on editing any of the libs system should be fine :p but if I had dev and production on the same server I'd probably have the two use separate installs of the libs. Maybe not node itself

[01:18] fakewaffle: I'd like to be able to do this.Post.whatever(....) instead of PostsController.Post.whatever(...)
[01:18] Emmanuel__ has joined the channel
[01:20] chjj: fakewaffle, what do you mean?
[01:21] fakewaffle: it seems like Post should be in the this scope? I don't get why i have to say PostsController.Post
[01:22] fakewaffle: down the road a ways... to access related models you would this.Posts.Comments.find(...)
[01:22] fakewaffle: should be this.Post.Comment.find(...), not plural
[01:22] tonymilne: I think what you are experiencing is the fact that "this" changes what it is, as you are inside a callback, maybe?
[01:22] chjj: you didnt require it
[01:23] chjj: posts_controller doesnt know about the Controller constructor
[01:23] tonymilne: posts_controller.js - line 4, this == PostsController
[01:23] fakewaffle: not a call back in teh first one
[01:23] chjj: you need to do something like var Controller = require('./controller');
[01:23] tonymilne: but on line 5, this probably != PostsController.
[01:23] fakewaffle: tonymilne: agreed
[01:24] fakewaffle: var self = this; would suffice for callbacks
[01:24] fakewaffle: so i have to required it rather than just var PostsController = new Controller('Post');?
[01:24] tonymilne: yeah, i came across similar problems, so i decided I would just set var controller = this; at the top of my model actions.
[01:25] fakewaffle: well, in app.js i have Controller = require('./libs/controller/controller').Controller;
[01:25] zentoooo has joined the channel
[01:25] tonymilne: so you have Controller as a global then?

[01:25] chjj: oh

[01:26] fakewaffle: tonymilne: really?
[01:26] tonymilne: Yeah. ;D
[01:26] chjj: if youre going to make it a global variable, at least try to namespace it somehow

[01:31] tonymilne: a little, but i find cake follows a how you'd expect it approach.
[01:31] tonymilne: so, i kinda just go with how I expect stuff to be.
[01:32] fakewaffle: yeah, thats why i like cake so much, its so straight forward
[01:32] tonymilne: I'll pastie some usage in a sec.

[01:35] tonymilne: Erg. underscorejs

[01:36] seivan has joined the channel
[01:36] chjj: fakewaffle: "this" refers to either two things - either whatever object the function was invoked from "obj.func();", or whatever was input in the first parameter of a "call" or "apply" call, e.g. "obj.func.call('hello');"

[01:46] marcello3d: the problem with all these nodejitsu/joyent/duostack/etc things

[02:08] marcello3d: Nexxy: yea, that's the annoying part

[02:09] Nexxy: halfhalo, 6sync is good
[02:09] Nexxy: pygi and badnews are great

[02:11] prettyrobots: I thought so.
[02:11] SubStack: prettyrobots: publish how?
[02:12] brownies: i prefer linode > slicehost fwiw
[02:12] halfhalo: yeah, but not the coupins
[02:12] brownies: i've still got a couple slices but i'll be tearing them down soon
[02:12] prettyrobots: So, how do you tell it to ignore .gitignore?
[02:12] halfhalo: if I didn't have coupins I would be linoding it up
[02:12] pquerna: ps, on the PaaS topic -> http://cast-project.org/ <- its written in node.js of all things :)

[02:14] Nexxy: they were wearing the awesome jsconf oregon trail t shirts
[02:14] pquerna: it can tail the log file start, stop, etc it
[02:14] marcello3d: Nexxy: I was about to say, how do you meet people like that on a train
[02:14] pquerna: and then later, you can say, upgrade X

[02:41] marcello3d: sarkis: I haven't used riak
[02:41] sarkis: ah ok.. i guess they would excel at different things i am sure..
[02:41] marcello3d: riak looks like it's administratively simpler, but it lacks the structured search that mongodb has

[02:42] sarkis: i really love redis but i dont think it would work for certain situations

[02:47] marcello3d: tfe_: awesome :)
[02:47] tfe_: we do limit the number of open connections you can have because with node apps, you can serve a really high number of users with a single free instance
[02:47] marcello3d: tfe_: you get points for it working first try (unlike nodester)
[02:47] tfe_: so we have to limit that somewhat

[02:51] marcello3d: but the duostack mongo connection url was scary as shit
[02:51] marcello3d: didn't feel like regexp breaking apart a url :)
[02:52] tfe_: marcello3d: use the node url module to parse it? that's what we recommend in the docs.
[02:52] zpao: our plan was "nothing to see here but we did this cool other thing that made it possible", now we've had to hack actual Node to get it up & running
[02:52] marcello3d: also, the hardcoded db name is less cool
[02:52] zpao: which is actually what i'm here for...
[02:52] marcello3d: tfe_: I didn't read that far down
[02:52] marcello3d: :D
[02:53] marcello3d: the docs are totally all ruby though
[02:53] zpao: can anybody point me to the first place a connection is first handled in Node?
[02:53] tfe_: oh, yeah we need to improve the visibility of this, but in the upper right hit the node button. that'll switch you to node edition.
[02:53] marcello3d: oh
[02:53] tfe_: zpao: socket connect?
[02:53] marcello3d: maybe have that button on the code samples
[02:54] marcello3d: that's where I was expecting it
[02:54] tfe_: zpao: or socket constructor?
[02:54] tfe_: marcello3d: yeah but more than the code samples need to change between modes. but maybe we should have it there too.
[02:55] marcello3d: well you should have the switch at the point the reader will be like "hey this isn't the language I want"
[02:55] marcello3d: cause I read all down the top bits and got to the code before needing to switch

[03:27] ctide has joined the channel
[03:28] aaronfay: Wa: the problem comes in when there's 20 urls for /user/do/something, I don't want to write a callback for each one, I would rather route all ^/user requests to another module to help keep my main app.js clean.  If you're familiar with django, then it would be like url(r'^users/', include('users.urls'))
[03:29] brettgoulder has joined the channel
[03:31] Wa: you can supply regex in the get url

[03:32] Wa: it's like the third example

[03:35] dabtop: yaya I got it
[03:35] dabtop: ok my job is done
[03:35] dabtop: thanks y'all :>
[03:37] aaronfay: Wa: I guess part of the problem is the verbage, I can't just route all ^/user requests to another module, I would need an express route for get() and post() at the least, and then I would need to parse the remainder of the url in my own module to break it out into handlers.  
[03:38] Wa: yeah, when you do the colon based urls it passes the info by name off to your function
[03:38] Wa: so you can process it more nicely
[03:38] Wa: if you need an arbitrary length after /user just do /user/.*
[03:38] Wa: well
[03:39] Wa: /\/user\/(.*)/
[03:39] Wa: no quotes obv since that's the regex form
[03:40] Wa: but yeah you're not redirecting all verbage
[03:40] Wa: since you do .get and .post and .put and etc separately
[03:40] aaronfay: Wa, ya, I am really looking for a solution that says, "okay, the url starts with /user, just hand that request off to module xx" and that way there's one line of code in my main file to handle any request for users.  'page' requests can go to the page module, 'widget' requests to the widget module
[03:40] Wa: you can do one for all but it's not reqired
[03:41] Wa: ok well in your module make the handler function
[03:41] Wa: we'll call it handle and your module is mod
[03:41] aaronfay: Right now, the main app.js just gets bigger and bigger, because I still need one line per url I need to handle :)
[03:41] Wa: so then you're like app.get(/\/user\/(.*)/,mod.handle);
[03:41] Wa: and viola
[03:41] aaronfay: Wa, I get that
[03:41] Wa: every url that starts with user is passed to your module
[03:42] Wa: and what's in the parens is available in re.params
[03:42] Wa: req*
[03:42] aaronfay: Wa, it's fine, but if there's 500 urls in my app, across 10 modules, I have 500 lines of code in my app.js to handle it :)
[03:42] Wa: ok
[03:42] aaronfay: Wa, what I really want is to direct all calls to each module, so my app.js has 10 lines of code for url routing :)
[03:43] Viriix has left the channel
[03:43] Wa: so you have 500 urls that start with different words?

[03:45] Wa: I'm really not sure what more you want though, what I gave you will pass all /user/* requests off to your module

[03:50] rmustacc: eguest309: Are you sending binary data?
[03:51] eguest309: yeah iam .data written to a socket
[03:51] rmustacc: ali: If you have to share it you could use the global object or an initalization routine.

[03:52] rmustacc: eguest309: Did you set an encoding on the socket?
[03:52] eguest309: no i didnt? how do u do that?
[03:52] rmustacc: http://nodejs.org/api/streams.html#stream.setEncoding
[03:53] rmustacc: Though if you're sending binary data that isn't ASCII/UTF-8 you're probably just going to get binary data in a Buffer and the way you parse that is application specific.

[05:36] dnunes: I have a node.js application that uses socket.io for realtime communication,
[05:36] dnunes: I have some "client.on()" listeners in place, but I want to swap one of them (the message one).
[05:36] sub_pop has joined the channel
[05:36] dnunes: I looked at the source code and the docs but didn't find any "removeListener" (in the Node.JS side).

[05:37] xeodox: thanks
[05:37] mscdex: 0.3.1? :p
[05:37] pquerna: sorry
[05:37] pquerna: its what google found first
[05:37] pquerna: google still stugles with versioned api docs like that
[05:37] pquerna: node having like 20 versions a year doesn't help
[05:37] xeodox: How do I delete a session variable in Express? req.session.delete() ?
[05:38] mscdex: dnunes: removeListener is a function for any object that is an EventEmitter
[05:38] xeodox: got it nvm
[05:39] dnunes: mscdex: Hmmm.. Didn't know that. Thanks.

[05:41] brownies: ok. is socket.io as amazing as i think it is?
[05:41] ajak1: brownies: yes
[05:41] Nexxy: brownies, moreso!
[05:42] Ond: Greetz Nexxy
[05:42] brownies: interesting, interesting
[05:42] brownies: have you guys shipped any apps with it?
[05:42] Nexxy: o hai Ond 
[05:42] brownies: is it... stable? trustworthy? etc?
[05:42] pquerna: Nexxy: seems its just a dupe of the github node wiki.... why?
[05:43] mscdex: i asked the same question
[05:43] mscdex: heh
[05:43] dnunes: brownies: I just did some chat app with it. Works flawlessly.
[05:43] mscdex: why not just add to the existing wiki
[05:43] dnunes: brownies: It have moderation, rooms, rooms variables...
[05:44] dnunes: brownies: I'm planning to do a full socket server for my next flash game with it.
[05:44] Nexxy: pquerna, good question ;3
[05:44] brownies: dnunes: wow. link?
[05:44] Nexxy: mscdex, I haven't contributed to either just yet
[05:45] Nexxy: I wasn't aware that the github wiki was editable (for some reason)
[05:45] pquerna: just use th github wiki
[05:45] dnunes: brownies: It's a closed project. It's a "virtual class" for a education project in Brazil.
[05:45] brownies: dnunes: now i'm even more interested =P i have an edugame company
[05:45] Nexxy: oOo
[05:45] Nexxy: how is Ond  this evening?
[05:45] dnunes: brownies: Seriously? I'll send you the link in private.
[05:46] brownies: dnunes: yea please do, i would love to see it. my project is http://brainracer.com
[05:46] brownies: *my edu project, anyway. launching later this month in the app store. </self-promote>
[05:46] Ond: Not bad :D How about Nexxy? Did you get unstuck from terminal?
[05:46] Nexxy: ACTION golf claps for brownies 
[05:46] ajak1: brownies: nice, i'm in LA too
[05:47] Nexxy: Ond, yeah but I'm still stuck w/o the proper resolution for my new monitor
[05:47] Nexxy: my video card supports it, X is just being uncooperative
[05:47] brownies: ajak1: ah, i'm angling to get out of LA pretty soon =P
[05:47] brownies: thanks Nexxy :)
[05:47] Nexxy: but apparently I break things when I mess with xrandr
[05:47] dnunes: Nexxy: Xorg?
[05:47] Nexxy: dnunes, yeah ;<
[05:47] Nexxy: also
[05:47] Nexxy: PDX > LA
[05:47] dnunes: Nexxy: I hate this new non-xorg.conf config style.
[05:47] Nexxy: just sayin'
[05:47] ajak1: brownies: same. it sucks here. i've been back and forth between norcal but plan on moving soon

[05:48] dnunes: Nexxy: Since I've been working with a lot of AS3 development lately, my main machine is being a Windows box with a virtual Linux. Weirdly enough, I never ever had a resolution problem in my virtual machines, even with all those auto-resize things.
[05:49] ajak1: brownies: startup
[05:49] Nexxy: ooh I miss AS3
[05:49] brownies: ajak1: oh yea? link?
[05:49] Nexxy: there's an AIR app I'd still like to write sometime
[05:49] Nexxy: <3 as3
[05:49] ajak1: brownies: non-existant. still assembling a team
[05:49] Nexxy: I wish js was strict liek as3
[05:49] Nexxy: kinda
[05:50] dnunes: Nexxy: Linux badly needs a more friendly config. My grandpa were using it, but the new monitor (a 1680x1060 22") got stuck in 800x600. I managed to fix it with a startup script using randr, but... seriously?! startup + randr for changing the resolution? Can't be serious.
[05:50] brownies: ajak1: oh yea. that part is hard, so i skipped it
[05:50] Nexxy: dnunes, yeah srsly
[05:50] Nexxy: all I want is 1920x1080
[05:50] Nexxy: it shouldn't be that hard
[05:50] Ond: What's your startup ajak1? Or are you unable to speak about it
[05:50] ajak1: brownies: but it's the most important. you a single founder?
[05:50] ajak1: Ond: it doesn't really exist yet lol
[05:51] Ond: Not even in idea form?
[05:51] Nexxy: ACTION passes out NDAs
[05:51] brownies: ajak1: yea. i have a bunch of contractors though. some of them will (hopefully) be hired full-time once there's cashflow.
[05:51] Nexxy: people are talking about their projects! better sign these!
[05:51] ajak1: Nexxy: LOL
[05:51] Nexxy: ;P
[05:51] Ond: bingomanatee on the scene
[05:51] Nexxy: quick! act juvenile!
[05:51] brownies: you guys better not steal my idea! i'm going to build a series of tubes and then people can send data over them
[05:51] Nexxy: it'll make him grouchy ;P
[05:51] ajak1: Ond: not really. i've exited a startup before and am looking to do another one. team is more important than idea imo

[05:56] brownies: heh. i hired a contractor to build me a node site, he did, it sucks and crashes 1000 times/day, so i learned javascript and node and started rewriting... hence, here i am.
[05:57] yenz: why Node?

[05:58] Nexxy: but it's damn nice overall
[05:58] Nexxy: with all of its pitfalls
[05:58] brownies: he wanted to use node, i believe in giving competent workers autonomy, i thought he was competent... you see how this goes.
[05:59] Nexxy: brownies, do you think I'm competent?
[05:59] yenz: brownies: yes... but why did he want to use Node?
[05:59] Wa: pff pitfalls

[05:59] Nexxy: no answer my question!
[05:59] Nexxy: do you? ;o
[05:59] Wa: though I am looking forward to operator overloading
[05:59] brownies: yenz: hm, not sure. he had done some basic realtime/ajaxy stuff so he wanted to learn node
[05:59] brownies: Nexxy: well, so far, yes =P

[06:00] brownies: now gimme back that beer!

[06:13] sarkis: ajak1: lol true.
[06:13] dnunes: Nexxy: But last time I checked adobe wouldn't give the protocol specifications for the public and everyone was having a hard time reverse engineering the communication.

[06:42] mike_miller: Is there any way to rate-limit XHR requests from node.js to another server? I would like to obtain more parallelism than doing them serially, but I don't want to flood the server with 10k requests.
[06:42] dnunes: mike_miller: you can do it code-wise.
[06:42] temp01 has joined the channel
[06:42] dnunes: mike_miller: just put a counter and check the Date periodically :)
[06:43] mike_miller: well, not quite that simple. Essentially, I have an array of data, each element of which corresponds to a request. So, I can execute them whenever. I guess I could just loop and execute xx at a time before moving on.
[06:43] mike_miller: yeah, I can do this in code
[06:43] dnunes: mike_miller: You can also limit concurrency so that you don't open too many connections at the same time.
[06:43] mengxy1 has joined the channel
[06:44] mike_miller: that would be bad for users though
[06:44] mike_miller: actually, I think I might run a separate node.js instance for this
[06:44] mike_miller: hmm
[06:44] mike_miller: how can I tweak concurrency?
[06:44] djazz has joined the channel
[06:45] dnunes: mike_miller: You can have a "call_next" function and a "request_finished" function. Also, create a "opened_connections" var in the same scope.
[06:45] djazz has joined the channel
[06:46] dnunes: In the "call_next" function you do a... if (opened_connections > connection_limit) { return; } opened_connections++; <request logic>;
[06:46] dnunes: And in the "request_finished" function you always call the "call_next".
[06:46] djazz: should I use node-worker or node-webworker?

[06:52] uclinx: check out my nodejs-twitter-livestream http://alexshulman.com/map
[06:52] micheil: dnunes: for one, you'd need a compact way of representing a drawing
[06:53] dnunes: djazz: But, anyway, you can use a setTimeout(drawNextPart, 1); to avoid the client-freezing thing.
[06:53] ivanfi has joined the channel
[06:53] tk has joined the channel
[06:53] djazz: dnunes, I thought javascript only could run one event at a time?
[06:54] micheil: uclinux: interesting, what are you using for the realtime push?
[06:54] uclinx: socket.io
[06:54] dnunes: djazz: yep. you will draw one "stroke" at a time.
[06:54] micheil: uclinux: hmm, okay
[06:54] djazz: dnunes, I did that but it takes ages...
[06:54] dnunes: djazz: The "drawNextPart" will finish and call it again. The timeout will allow another event to get into the execution stack and avoid the freeze.
[06:55] uclinx: the push is when the message arrives "broadcasted"
[06:55] djazz: dnunes, does toDataURL support parts?
[06:55] djazz: :|
[06:56] djazz: the canvas is 3000x3000
[06:56] djazz: takes 7-10 secs to render
[06:56] dnunes: djazz: hahaha. Now you're in trouble :P
[06:56] djazz: :P
[06:57] dnunes: djazz: So you're actually not "recording" the strokes, but rather having the whole canvas data being sent to the new clients?
[06:57] djazz: ye
[06:57] dnunes: djazz: Who sends them the canvas data?
[06:57] djazz: whats wrong with child processes?
[06:57] djazz: what?
[06:57] gqlewis has joined the channel
[06:57] djazz: a websocket
[06:57] dnunes: djazz: I mean... If I'm drawing and them you join it, who will send you my drawing?
[06:58] djazz: the server
[06:58] dnunes: djazz: But how the server have the full canvas data?
[06:58] jetienne: djazz: as a bunch of vector, or as a big bitmap ?
[06:58] djazz: node-canvas
[06:58] djazz: :P
[06:58] djazz: it uses the same drawing operations as the client
[06:58] dnunes: djazz: I need to update myself of these modules...
[06:58] djazz: getContext('2d')... beginPath..
[06:59] jetienne: djazz: ok so you send only the operation to build the canvas, not every pixel of th e canvas, correct ?
[06:59] jetienne: djazz: ok 
[06:59] djazz: from clients..?
[06:59] dnunes: It seems like the server have the "drawing history" rather than the full canvas. Which is good.
[06:59] djazz: it had
[06:59] Adman65 has joined the channel
[06:59] djazz: sending 50000 lines takes maybe 3-4 min
[07:00] djazz: rendering a data url takes 10 sec, but freezes the server for 10 sec
[07:00] dnunes: So the problem is that when this history grows too big, the new clients have trouble recreating the current drawing, right?
[07:00] djazz: no...

[07:01] djazz: see the page: http://djazz.mine.nu/apps/Collabdraw/
[07:01] dnunes: The server sends a full canvas data for the new clients?
[07:01] jetienne: djazz: seems wrong... i do 5000 cubes in 3d at 60fps
[07:01] djazz: this is 2d :|
[07:02] liar has joined the channel
[07:02] djazz: server sends the base64 png image as string...
[07:02] jetienne: well 5000 cube at 60Fps... is fard from 50000line at 1 frame per 10sec
[07:02] dnunes: jetienne: You mean... you do "render" 5000 cubes at 60fps, right?
[07:02] jetienne: djazz: in fact what im trying to say is that your performance are way below what it should be
[07:02] djazz: jetienne. the server sended each lines as one packet
[07:02] dnunes: jetienne: It's not related to networking, it's just processing.
[07:02] djazz: when i used history
[07:03] jetienne: dnunes: yep i meant render
[07:03] dnunes: jetienne: You're comparing apples to oranges.
[07:03] djazz: the client took 5 min to draw, but the server sended them in maybe 5 sec
[07:03] copongcopong1 has joined the channel
[07:03] teemow has joined the channel
[07:03] dnunes: djazz: How big the "history" must be before you have problems?
[07:03] djazz: who destroyed my drawing? :|
[07:04] djazz: idk, about 25000 maybe
[07:04] djazz: or 20k
[07:04] jetienne: djazz: the perf issue is in the network or in the render ?
[07:04] djazz: network
[07:04] djazz: if i use history
[07:04] jetienne: djazz: your drawing is super relatif. aka one line is super close to the previous one, in general
[07:05] jetienne: djazz: what is this "history" you talk about
[07:05] jetienne: djazz: the fact it is relative may be use to compress the data
[07:05] jetienne: djazz: do you send int or Number. number in json arent efficient
[07:05] micheil: you should be able to export just a static dump of the image
[07:05] micheil: as previously drawn lines are not mutable
[07:06] dnunes: micheil: but it wouldn't work to keep the sync.
[07:06] djazz: x and y pos for start and end, pressure for start and end, color as string, linewidth, type of line (eraser, other pencil)
[07:06] micheil: (you can only erase lines)
[07:06] micheil: dnunes: yes, it does.
[07:06] djazz: micheil, that is what im doing now
[07:06] djazz: i removed the history array
[07:06] dnunes: micheil: The server would have the "drawing history" and only send the "full canvas bitmap" for the first time, right?
[07:06] micheil: you should be able to store it just as base64 data or similar
[07:06] djazz: yes
[07:07] djazz: i am, micheil
[07:07] tim__ has joined the channel
[07:07] zentoooo has joined the channel
[07:07] micheil: the first time round, you can send the full thing, 
[07:07] djazz: yes, but that freeze the clients connected
[07:07] micheil: subsequent updates and changes similar mutate that object in your servers memory.
[07:07] dnunes: djazz: so, let's make it easier to understand: the problem only happens when new clients join, right?
[07:07] micheil: djazz: what are you using for communication?
[07:07] djazz: yes
[07:07] djazz: websocket
[07:07] micheil: how?
[07:07] dnunes: djazz: They receive each stroke and redraw it stroke-by-stroke or they receive the full bitmap data?
[07:08] micheil: which library?
[07:08] dnunes: micheil: "NodeCanvas".
[07:08] micheil: that's.. not a websocket library for node that I know of... link?
[07:08] djazz: http://github.com/ncr/node.ws.js
[07:08] micheil: ah, okay
[07:08] dnunes: micheil: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules#graphics
[07:08] djazz: it works great!
[07:08] micheil: djazz: that's one of the slower websocket implementations for node
[07:09] djazz: dnunes, i changed it from sending each line to full canvas image
[07:09] dnunes: djazz: So when you do it, the problem is the processing of the data, right?
[07:09] jetienne: djazz: support both, they both have advantages
[07:09] temp01 has joined the channel
[07:09] djazz: toDataURL, yeah
[07:10] jetienne: djazz: why not using an actual browser for the rendering, much more optimized
[07:10] djazz: if i could use toDataURL multiple times, on smaller parts, it would be good
[07:10] jetienne: djazz: store coord in a file, use phantomjs to render canvas 
[07:11] micheil: djazz: essentially you should have the drawing in memory on the server, and being drawn on the server, so that when new clients join, they first get the old data, then the new lines
[07:11] jetienne: phantomjs is a webkit, it will draw much faster than 50kline in 10sec
[07:11] djazz: micheil, I am
[07:11] TomY has joined the channel
[07:11] dnunes: djazz: micheil: That's what's happening.
[07:11] temp02 has joined the channel
[07:11] djazz: jetienne, this isnt drawing, it is sending in 10 sec
[07:11] jetienne: djazz: is that serious apps, how come you got so many line?
[07:12] djazz: people draw
[07:12] djazz: see the page i linked
[07:12] jetienne: djazz: so you got many line because you got many people on the same page ? 
[07:12] dnunes: djazz: Even if you fix the rendering time in the browser, 10 secs is too much. 1.5MB of data is not right.
[07:13] dnunes: djazz: Your server wouldn't stand it for a long time with high traffic.
[07:13] dnunes: djazz: You must find another solution.
[07:13] djazz: dnunes, its only when someone joins
[07:13] micheil: djazz: so, the largest thing that you are sending is the base64 image
[07:13] dnunes: djazz: Imagine you have some 10 new clients. That's already 15MB of traffic.
[07:13] micheil: that's the slow part, I'd say
[07:13] jetienne: agreed, perf on current implementation is only part of the issue. the design itself the apps is no good... 50klines is too much for usable latency
[07:13] djazz: jetienne, each time someone draw, it sends a line packet, server draws it and broadcast it
[07:14] hellp has joined the channel
[07:14] djazz: yeah
[07:14] dnunes: djazz: but it broadcastas only the new stroke. That's ok. This part is good enough.
[07:14] djazz: yeah
[07:14] jetienne: djazz: btw if you find a way to pass json data effeciently between the lcient and the server, im a taker
[07:14] dnunes: djazz: The first-time solution wouldn't scale much.
[07:15] jetienne: djazz: i do a first personn shooter, and use websocket to communicate... json is super inefficient for me
[07:15] djazz: jetienne, i am using JSON.parse and JSON.stringify :)
[07:15] dnunes: jetienne: Use raw-data, man.
[07:15] micheil: json will be far too slow for realtime drawing, I'm sure of it.
[07:15] jetienne: dnunes: give details
[07:15] dnunes: jetienne: What kind of data are you passing? Like positioning?
[07:16] djazz: i know binary data wont work, cuz of the framing
[07:16] djazz: of websockets
[07:16] djazz: 0x00 and 0xFF
[07:16] djazz has joined the channel
[07:16] dnunes: jetienne: You can send something like #<XPOS>_<YPOS>, for example.
[07:16] micheil: actually, all websocket drafts support binary data
[07:16] jetienne: micheil: in the case of djazz this is ok, you got say 30 people at once, each drawing what ? say 2 lines per second... not that much
[07:16] dnunes: It's much smaller than {position: {x: 120, y: 200}};
[07:16] micheil: it's just discarded as there's no way to interpret it. 
[07:16] jetienne: dnunes: yes
[07:16] MikeMakesIt has joined the channel
[07:16] jetienne: ?
[07:17] dnunes: jetienne: You can then parse it on the client with your own custom parser.
[07:17] jetienne: dnunes: so you suggest #<XPOS>_<YPOS> vs [xpos, ypos]... what is the advantage ?
[07:17] dnunes: jetienne: You have a wrapper, don't you?
[07:17] dnunes: jetienne: JSON have a overhead of the wrapper and properties names.
[07:17] djazz: each line segment is a line...
[07:17] djcoin has joined the channel
[07:18] jetienne: dnunes: ?
[07:18] jetienne: dnunes: which one ?
[07:18] dnunes: jetienne: Do you always send only the position? Don't you have states (variables like shields, for example).
[07:18] djazz: jetienne, saw the page?
[07:18] dnunes: jetienne: You can't send just [x,y] because it wouldn't be parsed on the other end.
[07:19] dnunes: jetienne: You must put it into an object for it to work nicely with other data.
[07:19] dnunes: jetienne: And this "envelope" will eat your bytes.
[07:19] jetienne: dnunes: i send json struture describing change in the 3D world. they contains a lot of numbers, a few string
[07:19] jetienne: dnunes: i dont understand you
[07:19] dnunes: jetienne: I'll give you a practicle example.
[07:19] jetienne: dnunes: so you suggest #<XPOS>_<YPOS> vs [xpos, ypos]... what is the advantage ? 
[07:19] jetienne: can you answer this one ?
[07:20] dnunes: Think about representing more data than that.
[07:20] dnunes: How will the client know that the array it is receiving represents the position of the player?
[07:20] dnunes: You need and envelope in there.
[07:20] djazz: use packet IDs
[07:20] jetienne: well when i think i dont see any perf difference between #<XPOS>_<YPOS> and [xpos, ypos]
[07:21] dnunes: {ID: {position: [X, Y]}, for example.
[07:21] mAritz has joined the channel
[07:21] micheil: you're probably not going to be seeing network latency if you're only sending point values
[07:21] jetienne: so so lets suppose i send {ID: {position: [X, Y]}, what would you send instead ?
[07:21] djazz: or maybe 0x04 where 0x04 is the position packet in one byte?
[07:21] dnunes: You can send more data: {ID: {position: [x,y], state: 'busy'}};
[07:21] djazz: :|
[07:22] djazz: packet ID*
[07:22] christkv has joined the channel
[07:22] dnunes: You can do a custom protocol and send only something like... #ID@X_Y%2
[07:22] micheil: why do you need an ID here?
[07:22] dnunes: Exaclty. You can do some byte manipulation (with parseInt(), for example) and send data with even a smaller footprint.
[07:22] jetienne: dnunes: hmm ok so another string representation... more compact than json... this is an line
[07:23] jetienne: micheil: i dont they came up with it :)
[07:23] dnunes: hahaha. that's just an example.
[07:23] micheil: you main source of latency is in two points: 1) your websocket server, 2) your sampling rate from the browser
[07:23] micheil: I can tell you that it is likely to be your websocket server.
[07:23] dnunes: You can't eliminate lag, you can't solve the stacking problem with TCP (websockets won't do UDP). You need to compress data and send the bare minimum (and at the minimum needed rate).
[07:23] jetienne: dnunes: ok i looked a bit a bson, it isnt string related. do you know a format which is able to fit small footsprint, string representation ?
[07:24] jetienne: dnunes: tcp is underrated
[07:24] jetienne: udp too :)

[08:39] indutny: hi! How can I use Cakefiles and external modules with latest npm?
[08:39] indutny: even when I install : npm install --global coffee-script watch
[08:39] isaacs: what are external modules?
[08:39] indutny: I can't use watch module from my Cakefile
[08:39] indutny: isaacs: that's actually the problem
[08:40] isaacs: indutny: how are you calling cake?
[08:40] indutny: isaacs: cake task :)
[08:40] isaacs: ok
[08:40] isaacs: does "which cake" find it?
[08:40] indutny: isaacs: I have node.js installed in /home/username/.node/0.4.7
[08:40] isaacs: oh, you're doing require("watch")?
[08:40] isaacs: in your cakefile?
[08:40] temp02 has joined the channel
[08:40] indutny: isaacs: yep
[08:40] isaacs: local installs are for require()
[08:41] isaacs: global installs are for cmd line apps
[08:41] indutny: isaacs: I'm doing npm install --global watch coffee-script
[08:41] isaacs: it's ok to install in both places.
[08:41] isaacs: right
[08:41] indutny: isaacs: is that wrong?
[08:41] isaacs: i'm suggesting that you then do `npm install watch`
[08:41] indutny: isaacs: nope
[08:41] isaacs: install watch locally
[08:41] isaacs: why not?
[08:41] indutny: isaacs: hm... why does this matter?
[08:41] isaacs: because globally installed packages are not for require()
[08:41] isaacs: they're for running cli apps
[08:41] isaacs: install locally for require()
[08:42] isaacs: things you require are part of your program
[08:42] isaacs: install them in your program
[08:42] indutny: hm... I'm running "cake build" from non-node.js project
[08:42] isaacs: ok
[08:42] temp01 has joined the channel
[08:42] indutny: so there can't be local modules AFAIK
[08:42] isaacs: so install coffee-script globally, so that you can run "cake build" from the command line
[08:43] indutny: yep, I can
[08:43] indutny: but it throws error
[08:43] isaacs: if you watn to do "require('watch')" then you need to install "watch" locally

[10:09] cachemoney: hogbog: how are you using IPv6?
[10:10] malditogeek: Guys, 'npm bundle' is deprecated? I just installed NPM and it doesn't show up in the available commands, which one is the "new" bundle?
[10:10] test: :eldios - sorry

[10:11] cachemoney: malditogeek: you might want to read this: http://blog.nodejs.org/2011/03/23/npm-1-0-global-vs-local-installation/
[10:11] hogbog: cachemoney, my ISP provides native IPv6 (im an early adopter) over DSL
[10:11] cachemoney: NPM has changed quite a bit
[10:11] chjj: sure, theres best practices for everything, need to be more specific
[10:11] cachemoney: hogbog: nice, in the US?
[10:11] eldios: hogbog, ┬░_┬░" srsly? where?
[10:11] hogbog: netherlands
[10:11] cachemoney: ah
[10:11] hogbog: they are one of the few ISPs here though that provide it
[10:11] eldios: damn northic ppl.. they get all the interwebs lucky :(
[10:12] cachemoney: here in the US, we still have to tunnel if we want to use IPv6
[10:12] eldios: :P
[10:12] christkv has joined the channel
[10:12] cachemoney: no residential ISP i know of has native IPv6 :(
[10:12] test: :chjj - okay cool, well i come from a java background and so im used to working with objects and classes. However, if I try to have lots of classes my node app seems to be much slower
[10:12] hogbog: well I used a tunnel before this and it worked quite well for me, I suppose there can be some problems with bad setups and MTU sizes
[10:12] eldios: cachemoney, like in most part of the world afaik
[10:12] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[10:13] hogbog: i find it pretty fascinating how IPv6 is still so rarely used when we already have RIRs running out of IPv4 addresses :s
[10:13] test: :chjj - i wonder if its all the require(class name) slowing it down?
[10:13] chjj: test: that could be any number of things causing the performance decrease
[10:13] cachemoney: hogbog: chicken/egg problem
[10:13] hogbog: in asia you can now only get a single /22 I believe as ISP
[10:13] chjj: require requires a module
[10:13] hogbog: erm not /22
[10:13] cachemoney:  /32
[10:13] chjj: test: it depends on what youre requiring, require by itself doesnt cause performance issues
[10:13] test: :chjj - yes - but if i want to use a class within another class i need to use require dont i ?
[10:14] hogbog: 1024 addresses, my brain appears to be half asleep :p
[10:14] chjj: what do you mean by "class"?
[10:14] cachemoney: lots of ISPs are giving out /64's to each of their customers
[10:15] chjj: all require does is return the "exports" object from another module
[10:15] superjudge has joined the channel
[10:15] hogbog: ah no I did mean /22, 1024 addresses, for a whole ISP and once only, so soon hosters simply wont be able to hook up new servers once they run out of their supply and cant 'buy' addresses from anyone else
[10:16] cachemoney:  /22 isn't 1024 addresses
[10:16] hogbog: in IPv4 it is, unless I'm confused? :s  2^(32-22)
[10:17] cachemoney: IPv4 = 32 bits
[10:17] cachemoney: IPv6 = 128 bits
[10:17] hogbog: i am aware of that
[10:17] cachemoney: you're way off
[10:17] test: :chjj - okay perhaps im not making myself clear enough...say i have two js files - foo.js and bar.js . Both of which are classes. I wish to use bar within foo i need to say - require(bar) yes?
[10:17] hogbog: cachemoney, how am I way off?
[10:17] cachemoney:  /22 is a shitload of IPs
[10:17] chjj: yes, basically
[10:17] cachemoney: like, quintillions
[10:17] hogbog: cachemoney, I'm talking IPv4 here
[10:17] cachemoney: ohh ok
[10:17] cachemoney: sorry
[10:18] eldios has joined the channel
[10:18] hogbog: np I only mentioned later on, my fault :P
[10:18] test: :chjj - right okay well think that but on a bigger scale. some of my classes use several other classes and so there a few require statements
[10:18] test: :chjj - this seems to be slowing node down
[10:18] cachemoney: IPv4's addresses are still very cheap, although i doubt that will last very long and supplies shrink
[10:19] test: :chjj afterall, require does block
[10:19] cachemoney: something like $1/ip/year if you have some traffic
[10:19] chjj: test: it does block, but it caches the object it returns
[10:19] chjj: it will only block once per module
[10:19] hogbog: cachemoney, yeah, the asia RIR can only give out sets of 1024 now, and only for the prupose of transitioning to IPv6, so as a hoster in asia you're already screwed somewhat
[10:20] hogbog: other RIRs will probably follow later this year depending on how quickly people start requesting IPv4 addresses
[10:20] test: :chjj - okay thats good
[10:20] chjj: test: require by itself wouldnt cause performance issues, whatever youre requiring must be causing them
[10:20] RusAlex has joined the channel
[10:20] test: :chjj - i have noticed a big performance decrease though
[10:20] djazz has joined the channel
[10:20] cachemoney: i don't think it's that bad for ARIN but getting worse
[10:21] hogbog: yah
[10:21] chjj: test: whatever code is being executed as a result of the require() call is causing that problem then
[10:21] cachemoney: i think we'll see a significant rise in the cost of IPv4's before people realize they need to adopt IPv6
[10:22] test: :chjj bad times
[10:22] djazz has joined the channel
[10:22] hogbog: though IPv4 addresses will be needed for people wanting to host services for I imagine a decade or more (to serve people with legacy connections), but the scarcity might still be there (unless consumer ISP that switched to IPv6 and do IPv4 through carrier-grade NAT are williing to 'give' some ranges back), so it's going to suck either way I fear :/
[10:22] cachemoney: test: you should debug whatever is inside the things you're requiring

[10:24] jacobolu_ has joined the channel
[10:24] cachemoney: *was
[10:24] cachemoney: what do you mean by legacy connections though?
[10:25] cachemoney: once consumer ISP's start using IPv6, most operating systems will have no problems using it
[10:25] hogbog: lots of consumer equipment (routers etc) won't though
[10:25] hogbog: so they'll always have to provide some kind of IPv4 connecivity
[10:25] hogbog: through an extra layer of NAT if needed
[10:25] cachemoney: ah yes

[10:27] Wa: use node-inspector, set a breakpoint on the require then step through that code?

[10:34] test: could you explain ?
[10:34] cachemoney: technically javascript doesn't really have "classes"
[10:35] cachemoney: it has prototypes
[10:35] test: :cachemonkey - whats the difference?
[10:36] Wa: a module is a separate js file that you require, it can return anything. Generally classes refer to specially built functions that act like classes (use new and etc)

[10:46] chjj: i never disagreed with you, its hard to tell you whats wrong though

[10:46] chjj: you have to be doing something truly HARSH to get your rps that low
[10:46] hogbog: a pleasant thing of course
[10:46] test: :chjj lol
[10:47] cachemoney: hogbog: not as bad as Java (prototypical inheritance usually gets me)
[10:47] test: :chjj im just talking to a 3rd party api and doing some data manipultion and sending back a response
[10:47] hogbog: ah yeah
[10:47] cachemoney: test: theres a big possibility you're blocking while talking to that API
[10:48] test: :cachemonkey oh?
[10:48] chjj: yeah, very possible, and likely actually
[10:48] cachemoney: or that API is slow (probably is)
[10:48] cachemoney: what API is it?
[10:48] chjj: i cant figure out how else you could get the rps that low unless youre sequencing the human genome for every request
[10:48] cachemoney: LOL
[10:49] test: :(
[10:49] chjj: test: what are you using specifically?
[10:50] beejeebus: one of the nice things about node is it forces you to consider carefully any sync code you write
[10:50] beejeebus: one of the nasty things about node is a single bit of sync code can slow all requests across a service
[10:50] chjj: test: whatever youre using is probably blocking, try removing it temporarily
[10:51] chjj: see if the speed improves
[10:51] cachemoney: test: if your communication with the API is asynchronous (e.g. posting a tweet) you should queue up the requests and have a worker go through the queue.

[11:02] test: :chjj - in my code i have a couple of forEach loops in which i create new objects 
[11:02] test: :chjj - bad practice?
[11:02] chjj: depends on what kinds of objects they are, and whether you need them
[11:03] chjj: also depends on whether they remain in the scope of the iterator function
[11:03] chjj: if theyre outside of it, there could be a memory leak
[11:03] test: :chjj - for example  this.array.forEach(function(result) { var obj = new Object(); anotherArray.push(obj); });
[11:04] chjj: dont use new Object()
[11:04] chjj: use the object literal
[11:04] chjj: {}
[11:04] eldios has joined the channel
[11:04] chjj: test, its hard to say without seeing all your code
[11:04] test: :chjj - no no that was just an example 
[11:04] test: :chjj - im using my own object
[11:05] Wa: in that same vein you could just do anotherArray.push({}) unless you need to address it again in that loop
[11:05] test: :chjj - and why using new bad?
[11:06] chjj: using new on the global constructors (aside from date and regexp) can produce some funky behavior
[11:06] chjj: its just weird, and theres no reason to do it when everything in the language has a literal notation, except date
[11:07] chjj: regexp is justified a lot of the time though because theres no way to do interpolation with regex literals unfortunately
[11:07] SeyZ has joined the channel
[11:07] test: :chjj - what if i want to instantiate an object i have defined myself, in another file?
[11:08] chjj: thats fine
[11:08] chjj: usually best practice is to put "if (!(this instanceof ctorn)) return new ctor();" at the top of your constructor
[11:09] test: :chjj what does that mean?
[11:09] joaojeronimo has joined the channel
[11:09] chjj: incase you dont use the "new" operator
[11:09] test: :chjj - okay is that better?
[11:09] jaco: @chjj thanks!
[11:09] chjj: if you forget to use the new operator when calling a constructor, it will call it as though it were a regular function
[11:09] chjj: and "this" wont be a new object, instead it will be the global object
[11:09] joaojeronimo: Hi everyone. What's a good Ubuntu 11.04 PPA for the latest stable version of NodeJS ?
[11:10] chjj: so that if statement checks to see if "this" is an instance of the constructor, if its not, it calls the constructor with "new" instead

[11:11] test: :chjj - more performant?
[11:11] chjj: cachemoney: that wont work because "this" is the global object at that point
[11:11] chjj: doing "return this" would just return "global"
[11:12] chjj: test, i would recommend looking around at some of the code on github

[12:51] e6nian: quacksalot: maybe it's the everyauth's issue.
[12:51] Navy: Hey there
[12:51] Navy: node is is troubling me
[12:51] Navy: I read a firl, parse data, alternate them and write em back to the same file
[12:52] Navy: file
[12:52] Navy: if I dont write em back everaything works fine
[12:52] Navy: but if I write, nodejs thorws errors
[12:52] Navy: writing only works also
[12:52] quacksalot: e6nian: i dont know. i know that the order of things is important for the session stuff to work.. but i dont know how to fix your issue.

[12:53] slaskis: e6nian: is the session middleware 'used' before the mongoose auth one?
[12:53] e6nian: slaskis: yes.I express.session({ secret: 'your secret here' }) in the express.createServer()
[12:55] Navy: can anyone help me with this: http://nopaste.info/8a969bad39_nl.html
[12:57] quacksalot: e6nian: you're missing 	app.use(express.cookieParser());
[12:57] e6nian: quacksalot: I use express.cookieParser() before the express.session
[12:58] quacksalot: not in the example you posted here: https://github.com/bnoguchi/mongoose-auth/issues/12
[12:59] e6nian: quacksalot:Sorry, may the example is not clearly enough. 
[13:00] Navy: really no one?
[13:00] eldios: Navy, the first row of the try
[13:01] eldios: file.writeFile should be readfs.writeFile as I suppose you did var readfs = require('fs')

[13:01] erichynds: my session issue is described here, any help is appreciated: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5883821/node-js-express-session-problem
[13:02] Navy: I put both, just for testing
[13:03] eldios: both what? var readfs = require('fs') , file = require('fs') .. like this?
[13:03] Navy: and the timestamp-decalration is 2 lines highere then in the example
[13:03] Navy: :)
[13:03] Navy: var readfs = require('fs'), file also
[13:04] eldios: file = ... ?
[13:04] Navy: file = require('fs');
[13:04] eldios: meh
[13:04] eldios: should work then
[13:05] Navy: I get "SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input"

[13:08] quacksalot: erichynds: maybe just get your app flow solid without the twitter crud to see if that's messing yuo around
[13:09] eldios: Navy try to take obj out of the readfs line
[13:09] eldios: it should be still reachable without passing it as an argument
[13:09] erichynds: quacksalot: yeah, good call
[13:09] Navy: then I cant access the obj-object
[13:09] eldios: why that?
[13:09] quacksalot: i heard/read tj say that people screw up the order of the session stuff all the time, which is why you can gen a bare bones app from express on the cli
[13:09] Navy: OK, the object afterwards is still empty
[13:09] Navy: I dunno if it can access the object
[13:10] Navy: If I alternate the filename in the writing-part, it works
[13:10] Navy: but thats not what I want
[13:10] Navy: seems to be a problem with open files
[13:10] Navy: node.js is nonblocking I thought
[13:11] colinclark has joined the channel
[13:11] eldios: actually as the readfile is async

[13:12] eldios: could be a possible way
[13:12] eldios: or you have to start thinking async :P

[13:50] eee_c has joined the channel
[13:50] eldios: test how are you making the calls? if they're not async you should wrap 'em in a custom async module
[13:51] test: :eldios - most of my calls unfortunately have to be done in serial, so i just have functions which i call 
[13:52] test: :eldios - however there is a part which i could parallel two of the requests
[13:52] eldios: devdazed object.method == undefined ? console.log("no method here, sorry.. move along) : console.log("method found! Hippey yay!");
[13:52] eldios: test then I suppose you should do a custome module which gives the async feature (emit events when finished)
[13:53] test: :eldios - oh my!
[13:53] test: :eldios i have no idea how to do that :(
[13:53] Tidwell has joined the channel
[13:53] test: :eldios im very new to node
[13:53] devdazed: eldios, thats not really the concept of method_missing.  its more like this.method_missing = function(meth){ if (meth=='foo'){ //do something } }
[13:53] eldios: look for eventemitters .. it's not difficult, believe me
[13:53] CiRlE has joined the channel
[13:53] devdazed: and that way if an undefined method is called on an object, the method missing method takes over
[13:54] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[13:55] joshontheweb has joined the channel
[13:55] eldios: like if a "default method" will be executed if no method is found?

[14:29] Tobsn: i set a breakpoint in firebug everytime the dom element changes
[14:29] bingomanatee: You nest schema
[14:29] Tobsn: and it is def. changing
[14:30] prettyrobots: bingomanatee: Are you talking to me?
[14:30] bingomanatee: You can assign schema to field types. , pr. 
[14:30] shanez has joined the channel
[14:30] bingomanatee: Well what you can do is eliminate javascript includes one by one in firebug until the behavior stops. 
[14:30] prettyrobots: I can't tell if you're talking to me.
[14:30] prettyrobots: Asking again:
[14:30] bingomanatee: that last was for Tobsn. 
[14:31] prettyrobots: How do you do trees in Mongoose?
[14:31] bingomanatee: prettyrobots: if you want to do trees in mongoose, assign sub-schema to fields.

[14:31] Lorentz: try that to see what events are hooked where.
[14:32] bingomanatee: Indefintately repeating patterns might be tough. 
[14:33] bingomanatee: What I would suggest is you can have an undefiend schema for children [{}]  and put the children in there. 
[14:33] bingomanatee: You'd be responsible for integrity checks but it would probably work. 
[14:34] bingomanatee: You also always have to safegaurd against infinite trees by ensuring that you don't have a referential loop in your tree.

[14:35] pato: has anyone worked with jsdom and jquery? I'm getting a "TypeError: Cannot call method 'runInContext' of undefined" error with the github examples :s
[14:35] bingomanatee: prettyrobots: is that making sense?
[14:36] halfhalo: ACTION wants a node app for bluray ripping
[14:36] prettyrobots: I don't know what undefined schema means yet.
[14:36] prettyrobots: bingomanatee: But, I can see how to do it the way I do it in SQL.
[14:36] prettyrobots: Simply create a single child schema, and build the tree in memory after selecting out all branches and leaves.
[14:37] prettyrobots: It is for a site map, so I'm always working with the full tree anyway.
[14:37] prettyrobots: Site -> Pages
[14:37] prettyrobots: And Page has parentId.
[14:38] prettyrobots: So, yes. I've got it figured out, thinking relationally. 
[14:38] bingomanatee: Yes - but my concern is at you would have to define tree schema "foo" whose field "children" is [foo] and that just strikes me as terrifying 
[14:38] prettyrobots: No. The page just has an id of its parent (if any).
[14:38] bingomanatee: That will work. You won't get the advantage of self-contained trees though. 
[14:39] prettyrobots: The ID does not represent a child schema.
[14:39] bingomanatee: However if I were doing this I would want an entire tree to be a single document - otherwise why do it in mongo at all? 
[14:39] prettyrobots: Just all pages has a pointer to a parent. All pages are read out. And the tree is linked in the application, not the database.
[14:39] bingomanatee: Your way would work. 
[14:40] seivan has joined the channel
[14:40] bingomanatee: I am not saying it wouldn't work. It just doesn't given you the optimization of self-contained trees that Mongo - if not Mongoose - can easily accomplish. 
[14:40] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[14:40] prettyrobots: Yes, but at the known cost of firing off a query to fetch each child.
[14:41] prettyrobots: Old problem. No new tale to tell.
[14:41] bingomanatee: I would personally, at the very least, include immediate children within every tree's document, and also include children_count in every node.
[14:41] prettyrobots: Nope.
[14:41] prettyrobots: Just need the tree, not twigs.
[14:41] bingomanatee: Well like I said - non-nested trees will work.

[14:41] bingomanatee: Best of luck with it.

[14:42] tyler-iphone: is there a way to invoke a function from a string without using eval?
[14:42] tyler-iphone: like object.invoke("function")
[14:42] bingomanatee: this might sound snippy but you can dynamically write functions to the file systems then require them as modules. 
[14:42] AAA_awright: tyler-iphone: What exactly are you trying to do, it depends
[14:42] bingomanatee: This trick only works once per function per session but it would work.

[14:46] prettyrobots: And use parent ids, which are much easier to update.
[14:46] bingomanatee: ah: one tree hill :?
[14:46] mengxy has left the channel
[14:47] prettyrobots: Yeah. I mean, its going to be a couple dozen records, or let's be generous and say, a thousand.
[14:47] prettyrobots: It is nothing to read that into memory and build the tree in a loop.
[14:47] prettyrobots: Then keep it around in memory because it will be used a lot.
[14:48] pato: why can this be undefined? process.binding('evals').Script
[14:48] bingomanatee: One thing to consider is that a website is a network, not a heirarchy 
[14:48] prettyrobots: Yes, but the site map is a heirarchy.
[14:48] bingomanatee: understood. 
[14:48] prettyrobots: I'm modeling the Contact / About Us / Press Release etc.
[14:49] prettyrobots: bingomanatee: Good questions. Thanks for making me think.
[14:50] bingomanatee: So long as you understand what you are building is artificial, in that if you blindly model your tree after page links the end product is not by its nature heirarchical but rather a nondeterministic colletction of pges and links. 
[14:51] bbttxu has joined the channel

[15:12] bingomanatee: all - the same way as if the project were small. 
[15:13] bingomanatee: Keep in mind that node keeps all its work in memory so you only have to worry about load times on startup - and I've never seen a node project that takes more than a second or two to boot.

[15:14] ximo: i'd like to see a smart way of recursively requiring modules in a directory once, and have them all available throughout the app
[15:14] slaskis: (referring to the path.exists one)
[15:14] a|i: bingomanatee: but in small projects we only have to do require('this') and require('that') once or twice, not 70 times.
[15:14] bingomanatee: yes. 
[15:15] bingomanatee: 70 times, 700 times, 7000 times... 
[15:15] DeltachaosDeskto: slaskis: thx
[15:15] bingomanatee: what specific problem concerns you? time? memory?
[15:15] a|i: bingomanatee: so i didn't get my answer, how to automatically require files in nested dirs?
[15:15] a|i: bingomanatee: none of, I just wonder what's the right way of auto loading those files in nested dirs.
[15:15] bingomanatee: You can use the file system to proactively read a directory for all its javascript files, or you can put an index file in each directory that loads its siblings. 
[15:16] a|i: that index files has to be maintained manually?
[15:16] bingomanatee: yes but you can do fs.readdir(__directory) within an index file as boilerplate.
[15:16] a|i: does node automatically load a file named index.js?
[15:17] bingomanatee: or you can create a loader class and pass it __dirname (I think) from the index context.
[15:17] bingomanatee: If you call reqiure('foo') and there is a file foo/index.js then yes. 
[15:17] bingomanatee: So you can embed loading rules in an index file and load the indexes recursively. 
[15:18] malditogeek has joined the channel
[15:18] a|i: bingomanatee: so that something like python's __init__?
[15:18] baudehlo: neat: http://code.google.com/p/traceur-compiler/ (this has probably been posted here before).
[15:18] bingomanatee: I can't intelligently make that comparison. 
[15:18] eldios: baudehlo, yes about 6hrs ago
[15:18] eldios: by someone
[15:19] baudehlo: ACTION wasn't awake then :)
[15:19] bingomanatee: What I would propose is this: if you are ABSOLUTELY sure that EVERY .js file in a folder's subcontent is a useful thing to preoload you can create a single recursive looping loader. 
[15:20] arpegius has joined the channel
[15:21] bingomanatee: If on the other hand you want more tactical control over what does or does not load I would create a preload function in each index file and as part of that preload either scan for subdirs or tactically load subdirs from that function.

[15:24] hij1nx has joined the channel
[15:25] bingomanatee: But yes - most people are quite comfortable with loading modules on demand. 
[15:26] strmpnk has joined the channel
[15:26] BinaryMuse has joined the channel
[15:27] konobi: bingomanatee: just depends if you expect to be doing it as part of normal operation often
[15:27] konobi: since require() is sync
[15:27] bingomanatee: I'm not denying you might have a use case for a preloader but since the execution of a nested preloader would be a three line operation with fs.readDirSynk(__dirname) feeding a require, I don't think anyone would bother seperating this distinct task into a class. 
[15:27] bingomanatee: yep
[15:27] bingomanatee: I personally don't write modules that "do" anything til you cal their functions/methods but if you do have modules that fire off actions when they are loaded then you would probably DIY.
[15:28] konobi: taf2: nice looking work on fork.node

[18:16] `3rdEden: enzo: twisted and event machine all have their pros and cons. but sure, you need to consider that allot python packages and ruby gems are not compatible with twisted/eventmachine as they are not designed to work inside a event loop.

[18:17] adulteratedjedi: pdelgallego: node would be as good a tool as any other language..
[18:17] c4milo: tjholowaychuk: that happens when you try to write a body when you are using the DELETE method 
[18:17] enzo: I guess a coder that knows js syntax should definitely choose node.js instead of twisted and event machine `3rdEden ?
[18:18] tjholowaychuk: c4milo: that's lame
[18:18] mendel_: enzo: just learn nodejs ;) you can't really compare eventmachine with nodejs + socket.io

[18:18] c4milo: tjholowaychuk:  :% 
[18:18] `3rdEden: enzo: It mainly depends on what kind of system you are going to build, what kind of knowledge your team has. But someone that knows JavaScript surely has an advantage on node ;)
[18:19] c4milo: tjholowaychuk: :$ 
[18:19] tjholowaychuk: c4milo: yeah you could use that

[18:27] Thorn: (on the same machine)
[18:28] enzo: It's surely a stupid question, but to be sure, I have a standard webserver running on port 80, I can't have node.js + socket.io running on port 80 at a specific url right ?
[18:28] `3rdEden: I still think a node based `man in the middle` is better solution.

[18:32] enzo: another question I've dealed with php, but maybe node.js can do it better: I need to communicate with a serial port (could be usb) node.js plays nicely with that or no ?

[18:32] ErikCorry has joined the channel
[18:33] baudehlo: enzo: I think you'd likely have to write a C/C++ extension for that.
[18:33] wink_: enzo: it depends on what you mean by communicate (especially the usb part), node has some serial port bindings
[18:33] baudehlo: unless you can talk to it over a /dev filehandle.
[18:33] ximo has joined the channel
[18:33] wink_: if your usb thing is just exposing a serial port, the same stuff will work
[18:33] mendel_: enzo: good question, don't know tbh.. did a search @ https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules but couldn't find anything
[18:33] enzo: imagine a rfid card that just communicate with serial port, easy serial com, really no magic

[18:38] enzo: ok
[18:38] konobi: someone did a presentation at JSConf yesterday where they wrote a VNC client and server using nodejs

[18:38] eldios: konobi, awesome

[20:45] Nexxy: you has RTP module? ;o
[20:46] mscdex: kind of
[20:46] mscdex: it needs work, all it does now is just set up the header
[20:46] mscdex: and build the packet
[20:46] Nexxy: it would be helpful to see what you did
[20:47] mscdex: i'll try and get something updated for node 0.4 tonight

[21:00] Aikar: how do you do staticProvider with new express?
[21:00] EvanCarroll: ah ha! I got the problem this time around
[21:00] EvanCarroll: it's in node-server
[21:00] EvanCarroll: node-scraper*
[21:01] aberry has left the channel
[21:01] Aikar: tjholowaychuk: poke
[21:01] mendel_: git clone && commit
[21:02] Spion__ has joined the channel
[21:02] EvanCarroll: request is yielding back to node-scraper, and rescheulding for it's own redirects. node-scraper gets the input from Request and sees there is no response and the code is 302. so it actually throws an exception not realizing that Request has internally rescheduled with the callback for the re-request.

[21:03] mendel_: I had some problems with node-scraper & caching, when I used "url?" + new Date().getTime() it always worked for me..

[21:03] Aikar: ok
[21:03] Aikar: and gzip?
[21:03] e2i has joined the channel
[21:03] tjholowaychuk: gzip is gone it sucked
[21:03] isaacs has joined the channel
[21:03] EvanCarroll: not a caching issue, node-scraper must not handle redirects.
[21:03] Aikar: hmm komodo hilights static as a js keyword
[21:04] tjholowaychuk: komodo is lame
[21:04] Aikar: yeah i dont need it for now, just figured id ask
[21:04] Aikar: lol
[21:04] tjholowaychuk: haha jk TM does too
[21:04] kleinerTod has joined the channel
[21:04] EvanCarroll: What needs to happen is Request needs to return something intelligable for libraries written ontop of it to signify that the request was rescheduled.
[21:04] EvanCarroll: rather than just silently rescheduling

[22:03] tjholowaychuk: it's an abstraction

[23:31] Postmodernist: Why do I have to run npm install pg twice before the pg module works?

[23:32] Postmodernist: Wiat a minute

[23:33] Postmodernist: Did npm recently change where node modules get installed?
[23:33] beejeebus has joined the channel
[23:34] dnyy: Postmodernist: For me they're in node_modules now, instead of .node_modules (which is weird, no idea why it's not a hidden folder)
[23:34] sveisvei has joined the channel
[23:34] dnyy: Postmodernist: In ~/node_modules, I mean
[23:34] Postmodernist: It looks like npm is putting a 'node_modules' folder wherever I run 'npm install pg' now
[23:35] stepheneb has joined the channel
[23:35] Postmodernist: So if I run it in /root/, I get a /root/node_modules folder. Which breaks my app because now require("pg") won't work unless the app is in the same directory as node_modules (which I don't want)
[23:35] dnyy: Postmodernist: Could be, I only ever run npm install from my home dir.
[23:36] Postmodernist: How do I force npm to install pg globally?
[23:36] Draggor: npm install pg -g
[23:36] isaacs: Postmodernist: -g
[23:36] Postmodernist: ah

[23:38] dnyy: isaacs: Why is node_modules not a hidden folder?
[23:38] uclinux: check out my node.js twitter streamer :-) my first node.js weekend hack http://alexshulman.com/map
[23:38] isaacs: dnyy: because hidden folders are jerks.
[23:38] Postmodernist: That installed it in /usr/local/lib/ this time
[23:39] f00f- has left the channel
[23:39] isaacs: always hiding there, wiating to sneak out and get you
[23:39] isaacs: :)
[23:39] dnyy: isaacs: hah
[23:39] dnyy: fair 'nuff
[23:39] Postmodernist: But require("pg") still isn't working :(
[23:40] Draggor: Postmodernist: You might have to set up a NODE_PATH env variable
[23:40] Postmodernist: I suppose I need to tell require() to look globally now? This used to work without any problems before this recent change to where npm puts stuff
[23:40] isaacs: Postmodernist: no, you don't.  you need to just install locally

[23:41] Postmodernist: isaacs: I really don't feel like changing the file structure / layout of a 14,000 lines-of-code node.js web app after months of development
[23:42] isaacs: you don't have to.  just install locally, and keep doing require("foo") or whatever.
[23:42] marcello3d: 14k is nothing :D

[23:42] Postmodernist: And have to listen to those luddites talk about how we should have gone with PHP -- I'll jump out the window of the 20th floor or in front of an NYC taxi
[23:42] walkah: isaacs: any idea why npm might be dramatically slow on osx ?
[23:43] isaacs: Postmodernist: or, if you would prefer to do things in the non-golden-path approach, monkey with the NODE_PATH environ
[23:43] isaacs: walkah: not sure.
[23:43] Postmodernist: marcello3d, get fucked
[23:43] isaacs: 14k is a lot if they're all worthwhile :)
[23:43] marcello3d: true, js is pretty compact
[23:43] Postmodernist: Sorry, I'm losing my mind as this project is failing to meet a deadline and we've been fucked again by npm changing the game
[23:43] marcello3d: 14k lines of java would be nothing
[23:44] Postmodernist: marcello3d: sorry
[23:44] marcello3d: Postmodernist: can you just use the old npm then?
[23:44] isaacs: 14k lines of scheme is like a whole operating system
[23:44] Draggor: 14k of haskell is all of it
[23:44] marcello3d: isaacs: and 140k of parentheses :D
[23:44] justi has joined the channel
[23:44] Postmodernist: The point is -- I am one developer managing 14k of code and we've only built a 1/5th of what we need to build

[23:45] alek_br has joined the channel
[23:45] isaacs: Postmodernist: nothing wrong with continuing to use the old npm, and then upgrade post-release.
[23:45] marcello3d: nothing wrong with not being on the bleeding edge if it doesn't make business sense
[23:45] Postmodernist: And I will literally kill myself if I have to listen to the IT guy espouse the virtues of PHP and how we should have used it
[23:45] jacobolus has joined the channel
[23:45] isaacs: Postmodernist: oh no.
[23:45] isaacs: php is pretty awesome, though
[23:45] Postmodernist: isaacs: I know I know -- node.js is in its infancy and is rapidly changing
[23:45] drogoh: Don't kill yourself
[23:45] marcello3d: yea, killing yourself is not cool
[23:46] drogoh: Kill the IT guy for advocating PHP
[23:46] marcello3d: especially over an it guy's ideas
[23:46] Draggor: You can do worse than php, like Java
[23:46] marcello3d: Draggor: hey now >:[
[23:46] Postmodernist: I'm okay -- just NYC is getting to me
[23:46] walkah: isaacs: it seems to pause for a long time between 'url parsed' and 'response' (when running npm install)
[23:46] Draggor: marcello3d: I code java for the day job, I wish it would be erased from existence
[23:47] isaacs: walkah: maybe the registry is slowing down a little, i dunno
[23:47] marcello3d: Draggor: me too, intellij makes it nice
[23:47] Postmodernist: So I did npm install pg -g. So now I just need to set NODE_PATH to /usr/lib/local
[23:47] isaacs: walkah: that point is while it's doing network io
[23:47] isaacs: Postmodernist: /usr/local/lib/node_modules
[23:47] Draggor: marcello3d: no ide can make up for how awful of a language it is :(
[23:47] Postmodernist: yeah
[23:47] rchavik has joined the channel
[23:47] marcello3d: Draggor: it's not that awful
[23:47] walkah: isaacs: the weird thing is, on my ubuntu machine(s) it's super zippy 
[23:47] marcello3d: php is definitely a far worse language than java
[23:48] marcello3d: the libraries are inconsistent and it's an organized mess
[23:48] isaacs: walkah: maybe dns bs?  u dunno
[23:48] isaacs: *i dunno, either ;)
[23:48] walkah: isaacs: NOBODY KNOWS!

[23:48] Postmodernist: I haven't had a day off from this job coding -- literally not one day off -- since February. Do I need a vacation?
[23:48] marcello3d: Postmodernist: yes
[23:48] tjholowaychuk: php is not that bad?
[23:48] drogoh: PHP can be good if used with competence, mostly
[23:48] tjholowaychuk: probably one of the worst languages i've seen
[23:49] joshontheweb has joined the channel
[23:49] walkah: it's a steaming pile
[23:49] marcello3d: the problem with php is it was hacked together without any regard to clarity
[23:49] marcello3d: or elegance
[23:49] walkah: it's also fairly ubiquitous 
[23:49] marcello3d: yea
[23:49] uclinux: Postmodernist: i find in nyc that is just the way everyone seams to operate... its difficult to get use to
[23:50] Postmodernist: uclinux: No time off?
[23:50] uclinux: 60 hours weeks
[23:50] xeodox: In Express, how do I pass a variable form a middleware to the controller?
[23:50] marcello3d: ACTION works 40 hour weeks in nyc >_>
[23:50] Postmodernist: Things were slower in Michigan. And quieter.
[23:50] marcello3d: Postmodernist: probably
[23:50] gkatsev: compiling node on a core i7 machine only takes like a minute. It's great.
[23:50] Postmodernist: I'm doing 84 hours/week

[23:51] xeodox: tjholowaychuk: You mean, set it in req ? req. what?
[23:51] marcello3d: Postmodernist: that's your manager's fault, then, not yours?
[23:51] Aikar: i do 40hr weeks mostly but for like a month was working late each day due to major release

[23:52] xeodox: tjholowaychuk: Just a string
[23:52] Postmodernist: So everything is always my fault.
[23:52] pt_tr has joined the channel
[23:52] marcello3d: Postmodernist: who set the deadline?
[23:52] xeodox: my middleware finds the string, and the controller needs this string
[23:52] Postmodernist: marcello3d: Me. :(
[23:52] rmustacc: drogoh: I haven't tested it, but I know no reason it shouldn't work.
[23:52] marcello3d: Postmodernist: oh. well then! :)
[23:52] tjholowaychuk: xeodox: just whatever you want lol for example we have middleware that fetches the user, and assigns req.user
[23:52] drogoh: Hm... the port marks it only for i386
[23:52] marcello3d: Postmodernist: not sustainable though?
[23:52] xeodox: ah ok thanks
[23:53] Aikar: so you also have the power to extend your deadline :P
[23:53] rmustacc: drogoh: You may be more successful getting the most recent source for now.
[23:53] Postmodernist: true
[23:53] drogoh: rmustacc: I'll try that

[23:54] xeodox: tjholowaychuk: Doesn't work. In my middeware, I set "req.abc=123" and then in my controller I console.log(req.abc);
[23:54] Postmodernist: How many days off a week is required do you think?
[23:54] jbrokc: coffeescript related but.. how do I configure watch and output in a scenario where I have .coffee files in spec/coffeescripts/**/*.coffee? 
[23:54] Nexxy: 0
[23:54] jbrokc: right now, `coffee -wo spec/coffeescripts spec/javascripts` doesn't work as desired
[23:55] Aikar: working 80 hour weeks leads to rushing and poor quality results, so just push the deadline. just own up to the guys 'above you' and say your initial estimate was sadly wrong
[23:55] xeodox: tjholowaychuk: Nevermind, i forgot to export
[23:55] Postmodernist: Aikar: Hmm
[23:55] Postmodernist: Maybe I can "sell" the pushback
[23:55] marcello3d: Agree with Aikar
[23:55] Nexxy: 80 isn't that bad
[23:55] marcello3d: */me agrees
[23:55] Postmodernist: Nexxy: I do 84
[23:56] Nexxy: ooh
[23:56] Nexxy: it's the last 4 that will kill you
[23:56] Aikar: 80 is terrible, 80 means you do nothing but work your entire time awake lol
