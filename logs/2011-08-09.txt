[00:09] hasta84: mscdex: before you had to specify the endianess with each call, no mather what
[00:09] rmustacc: mscdex: Mostly because there are currently only two endian options and people complained strings.

[00:14] hasta84: bnoordhuis: exactly

[00:19] mscdex: maybe you could reuse the boolean arg as being no-check or not
[00:20] micheil: ryah: hmm.. I think I was to git blame for that + 1 bug..
[00:20] rchavik has joined the channel
[00:20] mscdex: writeFloatLE(val, 0, true) would do a no-check, otherwise would default to check if it was not supplied or was set to false

[00:21] hasta84: sounds good

[00:22] hasta84: the LE and BE still looks weird somehow
[00:22] mscdex: why?

[00:59] thirtysixred: ale: You haven't routed /testnode
[01:00] thirtysixred: 80, yes.
[01:00] ruprict: RIght, you have not route for just /testnode (without the id)

[01:03] ruprict: Well, if you want http://localhsot/testnode to render index.html, then you need to route it just like thirtysixred sais
[01:03] ale: And it's on the same folder as server.js
[01:04] ruprict: ale: if you want http://localhost to render index.html, then do app.get('/', function(req, res){ res.render('index'); }); 
[01:04] ale: Should I put it yes or yes inside /view ?
[01:04] ale: ruprict: I know, but it's a subdirectory, localhost/testnode
[01:05] ale: So, should I put the rendering files inside views?
[01:05] ruprict: ale: But you said index.html was at the same level as server.js, right?
[01:05] ale: ruprict: Yes, both are inside /testnode

[01:21] racar: thirtysixred, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6597493/synchronous-database-queries-with-node-js 
[01:22] ruprict: ale: b/c you should have something like a 'views' dir for your view templates (pick a template engine) and a 'public' dir for scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.
[01:22] ruprict: Server up static resources from the same dir as your server.js file is, bad, b/c (as tj said) someone could just HTTP GET the source to your server.
[01:22] ale: ruprict: I know, but I am just testing different things I'd need, so I don't want to create many dirs, anyway isn't there any way for showing a .html?
[01:23] ruprict: There is, it's a static resource.
[01:23] ale: ruprict: How?
[01:24] ruprict: ale: So, in your case, it looks like you've moved it to a 'views' dir, which means you need to change the argument to the call to static to __dirname+'/views'

[04:28] te-brian2: zilch: So.. my plan thus far has been to use tobi to make the requests and assert.  You can see here a sample 'anonymous' test https://github.com/cpsubrian/wuzzup/blob/master/test/post-test.js.  Where I am stuck is how to authenticate the tobi browser before doing other tests.  Since I am only using twitter auth atm, that leaves out the option of actually filling in a login form.
[04:29] te-brian2: zilch: I guess mit git repo still has the global macros.. lemme push.  I changed the syntax a little.

[04:34] te-brian2: zilch: My current tests work.. but they only do anonymous requests.
[04:34] te-brian2: zilch: I also have a routine for emptying the test db and adding a 'fake' user.  Just can't figure out how to give tobi a session for it.
[04:35] te-brian2: zilch: What it really comes down do is I'm going to have to actually understand connect sessions and what everyauth does with them, probably :)
[04:37] te-brian2: zilch: Also, tobi might be complete overkill :)  But I like the idea of a cookie jar.
[04:38] zilch: I had to test some GET request and tobi served purpose !!

[04:56] newy has joined the channel
[04:57] jakehow has joined the channel
[04:58] SamNZ: Since I've opened the file in append mode, I will probably have to use fs.write rather than fs.writeFile to append the data to the file right?
[04:58] tmpvar has joined the channel
[04:59] SamNZ: Because the api says that writeFile replaces the file if it exists already
[05:00] dominictarr: that does not sound surprising.
[05:00] SamNZ: And because I've already opened the file, perhaps I won't have to supply fs.write with an offset
[05:01] SamNZ: I'll have to test it out to see how it works
[05:01] dominictarr: yeah, an offset doesn't really make sense in append mode.
[05:03] rurufufuss has joined the channel

[08:08] apanda has joined the channel
[08:09] fbrett66: random123: it's in a home directory but within ~/local/bin$
[08:10] dail: i have seen there is windows binary for the last unstable version of node
[08:10] fbrett66: random123: so yes
[08:10] random123: fbrett66: Find the node executable and do "ln -s ~/local/bin/node /usr/bin/node"
[08:11] random123: If ~/local/bin/node is it then that will solve your problem

[08:16] random123: dail: Yes, install Arch Linux inside VirtualBox, then install openssh/proftpd, and you can use WinSCP as sort of like Explorer, and Putty via SSH

[08:19] hlindset has joined the channel
[08:19] fletchowns: i'm not even sure if i should be using that
[08:19] mscdex: fletchowns: you can always separate the callbacks out into their own top level functions
[08:20] slapthelownote has joined the channel
[08:20] kdng-tr7 has joined the channel
[08:20] fletchowns: mscdex: seems like it would almost make it even more messy
[08:20] dail: random123 one moment why do i have to use windows 7 ?
[08:20] mscdex: no?
[08:21] dail: i think linux is better...
[08:21] dail: no?
[08:21] mscdex: fletchowns: all you'd be doing is pulling the callback out, giving it a name and using that function name instead of the anonymous function
[08:21] random123: dail: I wouldn't use a Linux solely as your OS, there are a lot of things you will need Windows for imho, I wish it wasn't so
[08:21] mscdex: the only thing you need windows for is games that don't work yet on linux
[08:22] mscdex: ;-)
[08:22] fletchowns: mscdex: ok i'll give it a shot and see how it looks
[08:22] mscdex: besides, you can always launch windows from a vm in linux
[08:22] kdng-tr7 has left the channel
[08:22] dail: random123 i can install linux and virtualbox with windows :)
[08:22] dail: no? :D

[08:22] kdng-tr7 has joined the channel
[08:22] dail: mscdex exactly
[08:22] dail: CS
[08:22] dail: i don't need it

[08:22] mscdex: fletchowns: also, what is mcpool?
[08:22] dail: Nexxy :)
[08:23] mscdex: the Nexxinator
[08:23] Nexxy: uh oh
[08:23] Nexxy: hai dail :)
[08:23] random123: Wine doesn't work so well, you will see
[08:23] dail: :D
[08:23] mscdex: wine works pretty darn good with the stuff i throw at it
[08:23] dail: btw i need: thunderbird....browser.......editor.....node.....printer
[08:23] dail: :D
[08:23] dail: stop
[08:24] mscdex: i wonder how many node modules out there still support node 0.2.x
[08:24] dail: mac toooooo expensive
[08:24] dail: so linux
[08:25] random123: dail: I agree I would never use a Mac however
[08:26] dail: yes....it is for snob
[08:26] dail: :D
[08:26] dail: ahahahah
[08:26] random123: dail: You will find that you can do anything you want to do with Linux on the CLI
[08:26] mscdex: even gui stuff with ncurses!
[08:26] mscdex: :-D
[08:27] fletchowns: mscdex: mcpool is https://github.com/coopernurse/node-pool
[08:27] fletchowns: (mcpool = memcachedpool)
[08:27] mscdex: fletchowns: ah ok, memcached pool, yeah i knew about node-pool
[08:27] mscdex: you have a separate db pool?
[08:28] fletchowns: ya db pool is for mysql
[08:29] mscdex: since it seems like you're just doing key-value stuff, why not just use something that combines the two, then you could cut down on having two separate stores
[08:29] mscdex: like redis or something
[08:30] secoif_ has joined the channel
[08:31] dail: random123  linux on the CLI ? do you mean installing linux on VM ?
[08:32] kdng-tr7 has left the channel
[08:32] fletchowns: yea i was reading a lot about redis and other key value stores, i think i may end up using it for some things
[08:33] random123: dail: The best solution unless you want the headache of 2 boxes and a KVM is imho from trial and error:
[08:34] random123: dail: You install a version of Linux inside VirtualBox or vmware, that doesn't come with a GUI, Arch is a good example but Ubuntu has a version with its DE/WM stripped out too
[08:34] sirdancealot has joined the channel
[08:34] random123: dail: Don't use a GUI inside VirtualBox because its performance is bad
[08:34] random123: dail: So instead, you install FTP/SSH access inside VirtualBox
[08:35] mscdex: eh?
[08:35] dail: hmm ok

[08:40] dail: ok
[08:40] mscdex: eddyb: what's wrong with the v8 api?

[08:44] random123: dail: I bought a license for $60, and I am like the last person who would do that, you'll see its worth it
[08:45] mscdex: eddyb: i've never had trouble with writing node bindings with the v8 api
[08:45] fletchowns: mscdex: if i rewrite them as separate functions, how do i avoid creating a resource connection and then closing it in every one of these little functions?
[08:45] dail: k

[10:04] hasta84: sooo... if I have some callbacks to schedule and need arguments for them, do I just use setTimeout(cb, 0, args) or is it way much less efficient that process.nextTick() ?
[10:04] Nuck: TheJH: yep
[10:04] Nuck: TheJH: Because everybody thinks it's crazy.  I'll laugh if everybody forgets about the law
[10:04] hasta84: but there are no arguments for nextTick so I have to work around that?
[10:05] TheJH: hasta84, process.nextTick(function() { yourFunction(1, 2); }); or so
[10:06] Nuck: yup good ol' lexical scope
[10:06] Nuck: use it and abuse it
[10:06] hasta84: TheJH: yes, I was trying with closures, but it gets overwritten
[10:07] TheJH: hasta84, then you need an extra preserver closure
[10:07] TheJH: hasta84, your code, please?
[10:08] hasta84: so if I schedule 2 callbacks: for(){ var x++; nextTick(f() { log( x ); }); } x will always be the last number

[10:56] senorpedro: i'm currently trying to iterate over a array and make a redis.set() in each iteration. as far as i understand the setting is asynchronous, so i cant just make "client.quit()" after the loop is finished. how can i make sure that all redis-set operations are finished when i call client.close() ?
[10:56] senorpedro: sorry, client.quit()
[10:56] Nuck: LET'S DO THIS SHIT
[10:57] Nexxy: senorpedro, look @ async
[10:57] TheJH: senorpedro, use a library like "async"
[10:57] Nexxy: https://github.com/caolan/async
[10:57] dominictarr: or write your own. every node js developer needs to do that.
[10:57] senorpedro: is there no way without a lib?
[10:58] dominictarr: read the code in the lib to see how
[10:58] Nexxy: note: I specifically chose the word look for a reason ;P
[10:58] senorpedro: ok, thx guys
[10:58] TheJH: senorpedro, there is. each time you make a request, increment a counter. each time you get a response, decrement it. when it's 0 again, all requests are finished
[10:59] senorpedro: its like parallel programming i think
[10:59] fsvieira has joined the channel
[10:59] senorpedro: is there a "waitpid" equivalent in the async world?

[11:01] zilch has joined the channel
[11:01] senorpedro: TheJH: but before calling "client.quit()" one must wait for all the set operations to be finished, or not? or is there a event "redis done"?

[11:10] fsvieira: TheJH: ok, I am trying to run node in a godaddy account, but since my account is too restricted I think godaddy is killing my node process, and I am running it with nohup. So I was thinking if there is another solution, godaddy runs apache/php and cgi scripts.

[12:02] Country has joined the channel
[12:03] micheil: Clex: Strings are for plain text data, buffers for anything Binary
[12:03] micheil: (noted though, that plain text strings can be stored as binary with an encoding of ascii or utf8 within a Buffer)
[12:04] TheJH: odie5533, depends on what you're doing - probably express for http, dnode or now for rpc
[12:05] TheJH: odie5533, dnode is more efficient, now sometimes does some weird stuff like scanning trees of object every second or so
[12:05] TheJH: odie5533, what kind of stuff are you doing with node?
[12:05] odie5533: nothing much yet

[12:10] dexter_e has joined the channel
[12:10] odie5533: I just want to know popular libraries used by a lot of people. like async, vows, express, expresso
[12:10] micheil: if you're doing websockets, either socket.io, websocket or websocket-server are the best.
[12:11] TheJH: micheil, I disagree somewhat. I think that something higher-leveled like RPC is a good idea
[12:11] micheil: TheJH: once again, it depends on what you are doing.
[12:11] TheJH: hmm, true
[12:12] micheil: I'm actually going to be implementing a JSON-RPC handler for node in the next few days.
[12:12] micheil: JSON-RPC over raw websockets, minds you.
[12:12] TheJH: micheil, one more RPC library?
[12:12] odie5533: What are people doing with RPC libraries anyways
[12:12] micheil: no, as in something to follow the JSON-RPC spec.
[12:12] TheJH: odie5533, call methods on the server from the browser and vice versa
[12:13] TheJH: micheil, ah, ok
[12:13] micheil: (only I bend the rules slightly and have params as a object / hash, as it makes more sense)
[12:13] odie5533: TheJH: wouldn't you use socket.io instead?
[12:13] micheil: TheJH: also, as for websockets, I'm the maintainer of node-websocket-server ;)
[12:13] TheJH: odie5533, dnode runs on top of socket.io
[12:13] micheil: and `3rdEden is pretty much maintainer of socket.io at the moment, I think.
[12:14] Nexxy: is anyone aware of a fuzzer specifically for node?
[12:14] zilch has joined the channel
[12:14] micheil: (as far as websockets goes though, if you know that you want to be doing the channeling of messages and use an event based interface, I'd just go with pusher.com)
[12:14] micheil: Nexxy: fuzzer?
[12:14] Nexxy: fuzz tester
[12:15] micheil: hmm.. no, I don't think I know of one.
[12:15] negrete has joined the channel

[12:17] eddyb: for node?

[15:24] odie5533: If I have a list of words stored in an array, is it faster to cycle through the array to find the existence of a word or faster to use a dictionary like dict['word'] ?
[15:25] odie5533: How are properties like that stored and searched in JS?
[15:25] chapel: well dict['word'] will be faster than a loop through the array or indexOf
[15:26] unlink has joined the channel
[15:26] unlink has joined the channel
[15:26] odie5533: why will it be faster than looping through the array?
[15:27] chapel: because dict['word'] is dict = { word: 'something' };
[15:27] chapel: and not dict = ['word'];
[15:27] odie5533: yes
[15:27] odie5533: yes, so why is the first faster?
[15:27] chapel: because you are pointing directly to the resource
[15:28] chapel: where as looping, takes a marginal amount of cpu time to iterate through the array
[15:28] bnoordhuis: odie5533: O(log(N)) vs O(N)
[15:28] bnoordhuis: odie5533: look up hash tables on wikipedia
[15:29] chapel: but it really depends on what you are doing
[15:29] bnoordhuis: odie5533: or O(1) in the best case but it depends on how javascript objects are implemented
[15:29] chapel: if its not a huge array, it probably wont matter
[15:29] odie5533: It's the same data. I'd just do dict['word'] = 1;
[15:29] kdng-tr7 has joined the channel
[15:29] baudehlo: I was gonna say, O(log(N)) would be a terrible worst case scenario :)

[15:31] odie5533: yeah im sure they teach algorithms in cs 304

[15:41] R4md4c: TheJH, Actually I am not used to asynchronicity and it confuses me.

[18:06] digitalsabre: I'm just trying to get a feel for how to get data INTO my browser.
[18:06] TheJH: digitalsabre, ah, ok. If you want to do it the easy way, just use dnode or so
[18:06] te-brian has joined the channel
[18:06] bradleymeck: longpolling, websockets, etc.
[18:07] digitalsabre: I understand node.js quite well, I think.  The whole problem I'm having is understanding how to get a browser to interact with it.
[18:07] TheJH: digitalsabre, there's socket.io which allows you to send messages between the browser and node back and forth, and dnode is an RPC library running on top of that

[18:13] dshaw_: They all do roughly the same thing
[18:13] damiano: dshaw_, i have seen i can install new version of node...choose with version to use...
[18:13] damiano: but

[18:14] damiano: npm install -g n
[18:14] isaacs has joined the channel

[18:19] isaacs: dshaw_: yeah, that's why a bundled node+goodies would be handy
[18:19] afters: hi, guys. I'd like to install npm packages for a user with low priviliges.
[18:19] tjholowaychuk: damiano you can set the prefix
[18:19] tjholowaychuk: cat the makefile you'll see, it's pretty typical stuff
[18:19] afters: I'm not sure what's the correct way to go about it
[18:19] isaacs: n{ave,vm,} are not really node installers, though, as much as they're node version managers.
[18:19] mikedeboer has joined the channel
[18:19] thalll has joined the channel
[18:20] damiano: ok
[18:20] dshaw_: and you have to have node to install them

[18:20] isaacs: you don't need node to install any of those
[18:20] isaacs: they're all bash scripts
[18:20] dshaw_: ORLY
[18:20] isaacs: yeah
[18:20] isaacs: this is 100% of nave's code: https://raw.github.com/isaacs/nave/master/nave.sh
[18:20] isaacs: you CAN install nave with npm, but i actually don't.  i just have the shell script symlinked to ~/bin/nave
[18:21] damiano: isaacs, if i install nave i have to install node also? 
[18:21] isaacs: damiano: nave is a bash script.
[18:21] isaacs: damiano: so, no
[18:21] isaacs: same for n
[18:21] isaacs: you need node for npm, but not for nave or n or nvm

[18:23] tjholowaychuk: damiano if it doesnt work well for you try the others out too, nave/n dont need config to get started
[18:23] ismell: express should implement a big pipe pipeline :)
[18:23] _asus_ has joined the channel
[18:23] jhurliman: and if strings, is there a standardized format for node stack traces?

[18:24] ismell: I would need to look into how the extensions work

[18:27] afters: isaacs: I got npm installed. Now I want to have several modules installed so a user ('www') could access them
[18:27] afters: how do I do it?
[18:27] isaacs: afters: npm install modules into the project that uses them.
[18:27] damiano: but guys n also installs npm automatically?
[18:27] WarriorSl has joined the channel
[18:27] tjholowaychuk: damiano not right now it doesnt no, not that it's hard to do that though
[18:27] afters: isaacs: what do you mean by 'into'?
[18:28] dshaw_: damiano: npm is the easiest bit to install
[18:28] afters: when I install modules they usually reside in ~/.node_modules
[18:28] damiano: yes sure...
[18:28] isaacs: afters: npm help folders
[18:28] isaacs: run that^
[18:28] damiano: but if i install more version of node (with n)
[18:28] damiano: do i have to reinstall npm for each version?
[18:28] tjholowaychuk: no
[18:29] isaacs: afters: cd thing/that/uses/express; npm install express

[18:29] damiano: tjholowaychuk, ok perfect
[18:29] damiano: thank you!
[18:29] afters: isaacs: thanks, will try it right now
[18:29] dshaw_: which I agree is a bit of a PITA
[18:29] damiano: isaacs, out of curiosity nave install npm automatically?

[18:30] springmeyer_ has joined the channel
[18:30] isaacs: damiano: no

[18:30] isaacs: damiano: i use that feature a lot to test different versions of npm against specific versions of node
[18:30] damiano: ok
[18:30] isaacs: damiano: but, it also inherits the PATH from the parent shell, so if you have npm installed in the main root, it'll be visible from there
[18:30] isaacs: damiano: from inside the subshell, that is
[18:31] damiano: ok perfect
[18:31] damiano: i will try both
[18:31] isaacs: damiano: but --global/-g  installs go into the PATH in the subshell

[21:01] TheJH: damiano, ssh tunnels the data through your encrypted ssh tunnel
[21:01] damiano: so is not important to "connect" to ssh on the server
[21:02] TheJH: damiano, err, what?
[21:02] Clex: Do someone know how to do this http://fpaste.org/tcTL/raw/ using Buffer instead of String?
[21:02] TheJH: damiano, you still have to connect via ssh to have the port forwarding activated
[21:03] damiano: yes, in this case i don't have to config mysql to allow remote connections
[21:04] TheJH: Clex, create a new buffer whose length is the length of the two source buffers combined and copy the data using img.copy() and chunk.copy()
[21:04] TheJH: damiano, correct

[22:19] timmorgan: TheJH: ok, I'm sure I'm running the new code, and still get the same results
[22:19] timmorgan: Here's something weird though...
[22:19] Metal3d: this is very nice... in fact I send some packet that are garbaged on distant firewall, when second client send data, firewall belives that connexion is "ESTABLISHED"

[22:23] bnoordhuis: timmorgan: why not buffer.length?

[22:24] TheJH: timmorgan, ehm, you're reading a binary file with encoding=binary, not as a buffer? ah, I like bold font :)
[22:25] Metal3d: TheJH, bold us again !
[22:25] TheJH: muhaha!
[22:25] Metal3d: TheJH, if you have remarks on my gist code...

[22:25] Metal3d: yeaha
[22:25] timmorgan: I guess that's dumb
[22:26] TheJH: timmorgan, I'd really read it as a buffer, encoding=binary gives you a string
[22:26] timmorgan: the api docs said I could (I think)
[22:26] timmorgan: oh
[22:26] Metal3d: TheJH, in fact, I think I can correct my script to accept input from stdin after clients are really connected
[22:27] timmorgan: so do I just set encoding to null?
[22:27] zilch has joined the channel
[22:27] Metal3d: and god, nodejs is a pretty nice system

[22:41] TheJH: SubStack, it could probably be done, at least on the node side, using func.toString()
[22:41] SubStack: yeah I hate hungarian notation but you could build something like that on top of dnode
[22:41] SubStack: not really something dnode should be doing itself
[22:41] TheJH: I know, it's normally a bad idea, but for securing weakly-typed rpc...
[22:42] SubStack: or just build a type checker that doesn't even need to know anything about dnode

[23:26] mrjf: On a related note, I can't really search for .npm, so I'm hear to ask: what does npm do in the .npm directory in my home?

[23:27] isaacs: mrjf: npm help folders
[23:27] mrjf: Thanks
[23:27] isaacs: mrjf: ~/.npm is the cache folder.  you can tell it to use a different one if you want, but it needs a working space.
[23:28] xerox: npm's cubicle

[23:29] fitzgen: Hello everyone
[23:29] fitzgen: I'm having some toruble with npm
[23:29] fitzgen: my project's layout looks like this: http://pastebin.com/1YaTyK5k
[23:30] fitzgen: and my package.json looks like this: http://pastebin.com/0eTrnrGW
[23:30] fitzgen: and I can't seem to be able to require("source-map/source-map-generator")
[23:30] fitzgen: etc
[23:30] fitzgen: can anyone help me out?
[23:32] edude03 has joined the channel
[23:32] fitzgen: isaacs: any chance you could help me out?
[23:36] isaacs: fitzgen: require("source-map/lib/source-map-generator.js")
[23:36] isaacs: fitzgen: packages are just folders.  dive into them.
[23:36] isaacs: there's no mapping or symlink magic (that died in npm 0.3)
[23:36] fitzgen: argh but that is going to break the way it works with requirejs and amd stuff
[23:36] fitzgen: hmmm
[23:36] isaacs: oh, actually, no:  require("./lib/source-map/lib/source-map-generator.js")
[23:37] isaacs: fitzgen: then don't use node's module loader.  use nodules or the AMD npm package or something
[23:37] addisonj has joined the channel
[23:37] fitzgen: isaacs: Ideally it should work with all of them
[23:37] isaacs: fitzgen: i missed that source-map is not a package.  just require("./source-map/source-map-generator.js")
[23:37] addisonj: whats the windows alternative to npm that sorta works right now?
[23:37] isaacs: ryppi
[23:37] isaacs: addisonj: ^
[23:38] isaacs: fitzgen: ignore my first response :)  the issue is that the thing isn't a packaged dependency, it's just a thing in the lib folder.
[23:38] isaacs: fitzgen: it's local.  use the local path to it
[23:38] fitzgen: I guess that could work
[23:39] fitzgen: I didn't want to make my tests require(../lib/....df,s.df,sf) if you see what I mean :)
[23:39] isaacs: fitzgen: or are you require'ing this from outside your project?
[23:39] fitzgen: I will be
[23:39] fitzgen: well CoffeeScript will be
[23:39] isaacs: yeah, this does nothing magic: "directories": { "lib" : "./lib" },

[23:39] fitzgen: I also tried directories: {lib: "./lib/source-map"}
[23:40] isaacs: fitzgen: while it'll make your tests just slightly more annoying to write, it'll make them *much* easier for others to read.
[23:40] isaacs: fitzgen: the lib directory is not magicked up.
[23:40] fitzgen: isaacs: well how will a third party be able to require("source-map/source-map-generator")?
[23:41] isaacs: fitzgen: you'll put source-map-generator in the root of your project is how :)
[23:41] isaacs: fitzgen: or they'll do require("source-map/lib/source-map-generator")
[23:41] sonnym has joined the channel
[23:41] isaacs: fitzgen: or they'll do require("source-map").generator and you'll do exports.generator = require("./source-map-generator.js")
[23:41] fitzgen: I see
[23:41] Spion has joined the channel
[23:41] fitzgen: yeah, I guess I just wanted something cleaner than that
[23:41] isaacs: this increases visibility into what's actually happening, if you're *not* already familiar with the program.

[23:43] fitzgen: isaacs: here's what I really want: source-map is a module, and there are two submodules which could be required by themselves without the other submodule ever needing to be loaded.
[23:43] isaacs: fitzgen: k.  put them in the root of the project.
[23:43] fitzgen: the two subs are source-map-generator and source-map-consumer
[23:43] isaacs: fitzgen: bonus: when someone reads your stuff on github, they'll see those things.
[23:44] fitzgen: I should put both of those in the root?
[23:44] isaacs: sure, why not?
[23:44] fitzgen: I guess it just feels wierd to put source files in the root when there is a "src" dir
[23:44] isaacs: require("source-map/and/then/whatever/is/actually/there")

[23:45] ryan0x2_ has joined the channel
[23:46] fitzgen: isaacs: when you mentioned the 0.3 magic, was that the stuff that would link the lib dir instead of the root?
[23:46] isaacs: fitzgen: yeah
[23:46] fitzgen: isaacs: hmm. I guess its been a while since I used npm :)
[23:46] isaacs: fitzgen: it did some crazy mumbo jumbo in 0.2 to link every module that was listed in teh modules hash, or the lib dir.
[23:47] fitzgen: but that always made sense to me
[23:47] isaacs: yeah, but it's a huge pita to track down when things go wrong.
[23:47] fitzgen: I see
[23:47] isaacs: improved failure modes are worth a slight up front inconvenience.  it's like seat belts in that way
[23:47] fitzgen: what if I moved lib/source-map to ./source-map?
[23:47] isaacs: sure.
[23:48] fitzgen: would I have to change anything in my package.json?
[23:48] isaacs: fitzgen: the point is that the require("source-map/blah/bloo") just maps directly  to ./node_modules/source-map/blah/bloo
[23:48] fitzgen: isaacs: roger that

[23:54] isaacs: fitzgen: if you have a "main" entry in your package.json, it'll go there.  otherwise, yes, index.js
[23:54] fitzgen: isaacs: k thanks
