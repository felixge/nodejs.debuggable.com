[00:02] Nuck: Really?
[00:02] Nuck: Why would you say that?
[00:02] rootslab: anyway, If I have stopped your discussion , Sorry ;)
[00:02] tjholowaychuk: finish up yours, then benchmark it vs formidable and you'll see
[00:02] Nuck: I'm buffering headers, but I want to avoid holding back chunks
[00:02] wadey has joined the channel
[00:02] Nuck: Eh, I'm gonna be optimizing to the level of Formidable once I'm done, probably.
[00:03] cconstantine: I have an object (created like 'var foo = {}') and I want to test of a named property exists.  I'm doing 'if (foo[propName])' now, but that is giving me a false negative when the property was set to null or 0.  Is there a better way?
[00:03] tjholowaychuk: for sure, it'll be a good experience regardless, im not saying you should stop and use formidable
[00:03] Nuck: well, I can store metadata in the other form parts, so it'll be useful as hell for us
[00:03] Nuck: I'm just worried that I'll make shit sub-optimal :P
[00:04] jesster7 has left the channel
[00:05] Nuck: Actually, I'm optimizing in different ways than Formidable, but I'm still writing pretty optimal code...
[00:06] softdrink: is there an elseif in make?

[00:07] qbert_: hmm , starting a new project, should I support IE ?  I want to not, just so eventually no one will use it and I dont have to deal with its crap, on the other hand ...
[00:08] jga023 has joined the channel
[00:10] asteig: qbert_: Totally depends on your audience. 70% of the visitors to the site I work for use IE, for instance.
[00:10] qbert_: this would be a tool strictly for programmers
[00:10] qbert_: well, and there managers :/
[00:10] asteig: D: Managers?! 
[00:10] asteig: Hmm.... tough one.
[00:11] asteig: Is it internal?!
[00:11] qbert_: yeah, if we don't find back though, IE will just continue to make all of our lives miserable

[03:21] paveq: it inserts user to couch database, and then there is this ldapjs-thingy serving it to libnss-ldap and pam
[03:21] paveq: then it runs something like this:

[03:24] tbranyen: but srsly why are so many people using the unstable version
[03:24] paveq: tuhoojabotti: no :p
[03:24] tbranyen: i had to yell at peeps at work
[03:24] incredimike: a potentially very large file
[03:24] tuhoojabotti: That's what I thought.
[03:24] tbranyen: gtfo off 0.5 for production shit
[03:24] paveq: tuhoojabotti: its linode virtual machine
[03:25] tjholowaychuk: tbranyen a lot of people dont know odds are unstable
[03:25] tuhoojabotti: Aye
[03:25] tjholowaychuk: node doesn't really document it well
[03:25] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: fo sho
[03:25] tuhoojabotti: tjholowaychuk: I reverted myself!

[03:28] tuhoojabotti: Well it turned green that time.
[03:28] tuhoojabotti: And I still have that api key, when it did.
[03:28] incredimike: suppose attempting to calculate a md5 hash for a 2GB file from within node a bad idea?

[06:11] amatuer: can u help me out
[06:11] framlin: and using node.js is innovative by itself ...
[06:11] framlin: ;)
[06:11] framlin: maybe
[06:11] amatuer: yeah! i kno
[06:11] framlin: what is your question?
[06:11] amatuer: but wanted some really new idea
[06:11] DennisRasmussen has joined the channel
[06:11] framlin: you need a new idea?
[06:12] amatuer: yeah
[06:12] beginner: hello
[06:12] framlin: make native gui-bindings for all platfors you know
[06:12] amatuer: have come up wiht something like real time reading
[06:12] amatuer: n annotation
[06:12] JumpMast3r has joined the channel
[06:12] framlin: so that you can develop platform-independatn native apps with node.js
[06:13] amatuer: nice
[06:13] amatuer: so what apps 
[06:13] amatuer: like i have to do with node.js
[06:13] amatuer: but needdd app idea!!
[06:13] amatuer: :(
[06:13] framlin: the apps ar not the main part. them first thing one need are that gui-bindings ;)
[06:13] bnns has joined the channel
[06:13] arg0s has joined the channel
[06:14] framlin: ist a lib/framework-idea thats much mor and much more sustainable than just an app-idea
[06:14] amatuer: oh i want to extend it to a yr long work!
[06:14] amatuer: soemthing big!!!!!
[06:15] framlin: oh, belive me, a framwork for native html5/css-nodejs-apps is a HUGE work ;)
[06:15] framlin: something VERY BIG
[06:15] amatuer: :O
[06:15] amatuer: ok ok
[06:16] framlin: or now as an app-idea I wanted to have a text-based-consel-html-client that understands JavaScript
[06:16] amatuer: can i kno something more
[06:16] beginner: ahi framlin actually wat is meant by a gui-bindings??
[06:16] Lorentz: node.js based window manager
[06:16] Lorentz: / desktop environment
[06:16] framlin: so you can run realtime-fancy-web-2.0-sites from console
[06:17] framlin: beginner: gui-bindings is ofcourse not the right term.
[06:17] amatuer: u mean we need to create a console app?
[06:17] beginner: ok..
[06:18] framlin: I wanted to have something, that makes html5/CSS-based apps runing onn all OSs. Something like Mozillas XUL but with w3c-standards and nodejs
[06:18] framlin: amatuer: nop,that is a second idea

[06:19] avalanche123 has joined the channel
[06:20] framlin: there are many people all over the world, that cannot see, so they have to use text-to-speech combined with e.g. lynx
[06:20] amatuer: now is this third one?
[06:20] amatuer: but u kno htere are so many plugins
[06:20] mcepl_ has joined the channel
[06:20] mcepl has joined the channel
[06:20] amatuer: for text to speech
[06:21] framlin: but the text-html-clients do mostly not understand js in a manner that enables them to run e.g. ajax-sites

[06:21] abraxas_ has joined the channel
[06:21] g2872 has joined the channel

[06:21] g2873 has joined the channel
[06:22] amatuer: ok now stick to one thing
[06:22] amatuer: n tell in detail abt it
[06:22] framlin: text-to-speech is no problem, but the "rendering" of a web-site that uses all this new fancy "ajax-stuff" is not available
[06:23] amatuer: u mean recommendation?
[06:23] amatuer: we hcan have tags
[06:23] amatuer: n then recommend
[06:23] amatuer: based on their interests
[06:24] amatuer: ??
[06:26] framlin: try to use try to use facebook or google-plus or something like that with lynx
[06:26] mraleph has joined the channel

[06:26] amatuer: eyah
[06:26] bnns: hi can anyone help me with installing node using cygwin? i'm getting an error
[06:27] framlin: I mean a text/console-based browser that is able to handle all that JS-stuff that modern sites have built in
[06:27] amatuer: so a new browser u mean?
[06:27] bnns: something with cxx_link
[06:27] amatuer: with all readability n text-voice
[06:27] framlin: yepp, you got it
[06:28] amatuer: so manyyyyy browsers are there
[06:28] amatuer: do u think ppl switch to another one 
[06:28] framlin: but only with Text-IO so you can control it via voice because there are a lot of text-speech-text - plugins around
[06:28] amatuer: instead they would liek to use the existing browser with new plugings
[06:29] framlin: but peaploe who cannot see or are on a internetconnections without grafic available have no chance to visit modern sites
[06:29] lot49 has joined the channel

[06:30] amatuer: so u wanna tell that .. new browser with html5 and othr things
[06:30] amatuer: ?
[06:30] amatuer: u think the existign browser wont do all that!!
[06:30] amatuer: crome n firefox man!!
[06:31] framlin: but if you cannot use chrome, because you have an ssh connection without X, you cannot use chromes-fancy-plugins
[06:31] framlin: u cannot use firefoy to
[06:32] Croms has joined the channel
[06:32] amatuer: cant we create a plugin with all this
[06:32] amatuer: so it can support existing browser
[06:32] framlin: and if you cannot see anything because you are blind, new mozilla-pluggins wouldnt helb you too
[06:32] Renegade001 has joined the channel
[06:32] amatuer: so basically web browser for blind!1
[06:33] framlin: ok, that were two very very good ideas, I do not have more ;)
[06:33] framlin: amatuer: YEPP
[06:33] simenbrekken has joined the channel
[06:34] framlin: but thats not only good for blind peaople, there are a lot of circumstances, where you have to use terminals without grafic ....
[06:34] amatuer: i need to have a time line for my work too
[06:34] amatuer: hmm i guess this will work
[06:34] amatuer: but can i kno more moer abt it!!

[06:35] Nuck: Hullo again
[06:36] amatuer: what do u think the existing browser fro visually impaired is lacking
[06:36] stalled has joined the channel
[06:37] framlin: I think a first step would be to "render" all possible sites. Lets say with not-realtime-javascript until 31.12.2011
[06:37] framlin: amatuer: first thin is, you have tor "serialize" all the things you have to show
[06:37] amatuer: yeah thats what i wanted
[06:37] amatuer: go on
[06:38] framlin: you have onle "one dimension" if you read a text
[06:38] amatuer: yeah got it
[06:38] Nuck: ACTION has "another dimension" pop info his head
[06:38] framlin: so if you are able to interpret all that 2-dimension-layout into a one-serialized-layout you hav a first step to your first milestone
[06:39] framlin: lets say until november ;)
[06:39] amatuer: woah!
[06:39] dmkbot: *add 'subprocess' alias to 'child_process' ?* reported by ry: https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/1549
[06:40] framlin: then you need the possibility to handle "ajax-exeptions" that is, that at any time there may be new stuff that should be spoken out

[06:41] beginner: framlin: actually wats this 2-dimension layout??
[06:41] framlin: you wanted an idea for a HUGE projet ... that it ;)
[06:41] boltR has joined the channel
[06:41] amatuer: yeah!!
[06:41] Nuck: deoxxa: Not bots, an NKO client
[06:42] framlin: beginner: on a grafical screen you have 2-dimensions
[06:42] amatuer: like 10 months project
[06:42] framlin: the lyout is two-dimensional
[06:42] Marak: dont make me bring in the real bots
[06:42] Marak: go use a test room
[06:42] framlin: if you read the side there is only one dimension left, the time
[06:43] beginner: sry dint get..
[06:43] framlin: so lets say you have to columns, you may read first the first column an then the second column
[06:43] beginner: ya
[06:43] framlin: beginner: close you eyes
[06:43] beginner: right

[06:46] robotmay has joined the channel
[06:46] Nuck: Solution: headless webkit
[06:46] framlin: so for that you have to "serialize" everithin, so you present it "sentence by centence"
[06:46] Nuck: ACTION points to PhantomJS
[06:46] amatuer: hmm wait
[06:46] framlin: beginner: its only ONE-dimensional
[06:46] amatuer: let me get a proper documentation for this idea
[06:47] beginner: ok

[06:48] amatuer: yeah 
[06:48] amatuer: i need a help
[06:48] amatuer: coz i still have no cleaaar idea!

[06:49] amatuer: i have to write a documentaion for whatever i work on this yr!1
[06:49] Nuck: Web apps
[06:49] amatuer: yeah web apps
[06:50] Nuck: Jesus fuck
[06:50] Nuck: That's a killer
[06:50] framlin: Nuck: there are, but would you like to be limited to "certain sites"
[06:50] amatuer: what are you talking abt?
[06:50] Nuck: Can't translate a GUI into a vocal UI that easily :P
[06:50] amatuer: lol
[06:50] amatuer: thats the great part of the work!
[06:51] framlin: thats the problem ;)
[06:51] amatuer: guys can i know your real face
[06:51] amatuer: so that we can work on this
[06:51] Nuck: It's not really feasible.
[06:51] amatuer: ok!
[06:51] Nuck: I've got my own business to run lol
[06:51] amatuer: lets be practical and talk abt soemthing which can happen
[06:52] framlin: Nuck: yes, its really difficult, but I think with a technology like node, where you can build server-side-browsers, you hav e a good starting-point
[06:52] Nuck: Speaking of which I should get some sleep. Gotta work on my YC application tomorrow :D
[06:52] framlin: with eg jsdom, you do not have to code the DOM-Handling yourself etc. pp.
[06:52] amatuer: NOW I HAVE TO WORK ON SOMETHING THIS YEAR SO ASKIGN 
[06:53] Nuck: framlin: That's not the problem 
[06:53] Nuck: The issue is that it's not possible to interpret a GUI and make it respond to vocal commands
[06:53] framlin: Nuck: yes, so you may concentrate on the real problem and not all that "infrastucture stuff" arround

[06:54] amatuer: :(
[06:54] Nuck: It's barely on maybe 10% of Google pages
[06:54] framlin: yes, but there some solutions that can be used and implemented within a text-browser

[08:05] dexter_e: framlin: Thats correct, but I'm also injecting JSON collections into the HTML pages before being sent.
[08:05] framlin: dexter_e: I never use script-tags to embed js-code directly, so I only have noticd the script-file-thing
[08:05] dexter_e: framlin: If not script tags directly then how?  load them ?
[08:05] framlin: hm, mybe you could have a script with JASON-getter-methods
[08:06] dexter_e: but that about mean a double request eh ?
[08:06] framlin: JSON
[08:06] dexter_e: I want the JSON data to arrive with the original HTML object 
[08:06] framlin: hm, ok, there I have no idea at the moment

[08:17] aeo: (I'm using node 0.4.11 on CentOS 5.6)
[08:17] dexter_e: aeo: read what it says in your console

[09:53] japj: ryah: d_namlen does not exists on my linux machine, http://linux.die.net/man/3/readdir

[10:07] eldios: ^^
[10:07] eldios: k tnx

[12:18] tuhoojabotti: console.log should work.
[12:18] Vertice: i prefer console.warn ost of the time
[12:18] andreyvit: Hey. I wonder if anyone knows what might be my best bet in doing unicode KD decomposition in Node.js? Nothing similar found in the list of modules. Any ICU bindings? If not, any simple way to create them? Existing project this is best contributed to?

[12:21] versicolor has joined the channel
[12:21] jheusala: wrong channel
[12:22] H4ns: cjheath: it uses libeio and libev
[12:22] cjheath: I.E. the eoi lib seems to use pthreads to support "truly asynchronous I/O"
[12:22] ParadoxQuine has joined the channel
[12:22] cjheath: which is a little surprising to me :)
[12:22] tuhoojabotti: stagas: Can you play it?
[12:22] stagas: tuhoojabotti: yeah in chrome
[12:22] tuhoojabotti: it keeps refreshing for me

[12:23] descipher has joined the channel
[12:23] AaronMT has joined the channel
[12:23] cjheath: Well the idea of using evented IO is that you don't need to use threads... so to emulate events using threads seems odd, that's all
[12:23] H4ns: cjheath: (i am using node in an embedded situation, too.  i'm not a node "internals developer" though, but an extension writer, if you will)
[12:24] garrensmith has joined the channel
[12:24] cjheath: It's not a problem; the largish code-base I have to integrate also uses pthreads, so should be ok
[12:24] sebastia_ has joined the channel
[12:24] cjheath: So this device is a Gumstix, Arm A8 Cortex
[12:24] H4ns: cjheath: right.  you just need to make sure that you are using the right mechanisms to communicate between node's thread and your other threads
[12:25] H4ns: cjheath: i'm on a bugbase 2.0, which is cortex a8 as well.
[12:25] cjheath: Ok, rigt, that's why I came here
[12:25] cjheath: I've done threaded code in C++ before, so I don't nee orientatuin on that... but where to find the right PIs inside node?
[12:25] cjheath: *APIs
[12:25] H4ns: cjheath: i've been using libev to connect my asynchronous threads to node's.
[12:26] cjheath: DO you have stuff being triggered from the interrupt level?
[12:26] H4ns: cjheath: basically, what you will be using is the V8 api, and you'll have to look at existing code to fifgure your way out.
[12:26] Raynos: cjheath: it also uses iocp on windows
[12:26] cjheath: Best example of "existing code" - node is getting rather big now :)
[12:26] H4ns: cjheath: no, i'm not running node inside of the kernel if that is what you mean to say.
[12:27] cjheath: Oh, ok, right
[12:27] H4ns: Raynos: we're talking embedded linux
[12:27] Raynos: Ah ok.
[12:27] Raynos: I just read embedded
[12:27] Raynos: Didn't stop to think that embedded windows might be stupid
[12:27] cjheath: So I need device drivers (for Screen, buttons, and the FPGA that does the guts of the instrument;s work)
[12:27] stride: stagas: damn :) you're too good at this ;>
[12:27] cjheath: then interface those using FDs in eoi or whatevs
[12:28] cjheath: Sounds about right H4ns?
[12:28] stagas: stride: wish it had rounds
[12:28] H4ns: cjheath: or threads and libev.  you can look at https://github.com/hanshuebner/node-pjsip for some code that has a pretty involved way to get asynchronous callbacks from a foreign library back into node.
[12:29] H4ns: cjheath: correct, yes.
[12:29] cjheath: xlnt

[13:51] kerneis: how are you supposed to drop root privileges safely?
[13:51] kerneis: (I know this is not portable, but setuid and setgid are already there, so...)
[13:52] H4ns: kerneis: you could consider that it is just not possible.  just a thought.
[13:53] kerneis: yeah, this is what I believe currently, but I just cannot understand that no one ever wanted to drop privileges in a node.js program
[13:53] kerneis: I mean, people have been writing servers in node.js for at least a year, now
[13:53] mikl has joined the channel
[13:53] kerneis: do they all run as root?

[13:54] JJMalina has joined the channel

[13:55] marksoper has joined the channel
[13:55] kerneis: Aikar: no, you have supplementary groups
[13:56] lukegalea: kerneis: One more hint :) If you are using something like cluster, etc - you need to use authbind --deep, so that all spawned processes have the ability to use privileged ports as well.
[13:56] kerneis: and you also want to guess the setgid identifier from the username

[15:02] Chopinn has joined the channel
[15:02] chjj: explodes: i think its kind of hard, dates are all stored internally as gmt unix time, and there is no setTimezoneOffset, so that means in order to render a date as a different timezone you actually need to change the internal timestamp

[15:02] chjj: which complicates things a lot

[15:03] chjj: more code than it was worth imo =/
[15:04] Glenjamin: it's probably worth porting a proper date lib from some other language
[15:04] Glenjamin: since JS's code Date object is rather lacking
[15:04] chjj: what you could do is add maybe a Date.prototype.toTimezone which would create a new date object with the proper timestamp
[15:04] chjj: it would have to examine the current offset and then calculate the offset you want

[15:11] sneakyness has joined the channel
[15:11] otaku_coder: pjacobs: that didn't work - cannot call method 'emit' of undefined

[15:35] H4ns: incredimike: then you're doing something wrong.  did you look at the code that i refered you to?  is your program doing the same thing?
[15:36] incredimike: well I'm obviously doing something wrong ;)
[15:36] incredimike: just trying to figure out what
[15:36] incredimike: this code: https://github.com/hanshuebner/node-superupload/blob/master/server.js ?

[15:47] mannymanny: ..
[15:47] chjj: incredimike: it comes with a prepackaged middleware
[15:47] al3xnull_ has joined the channel
[15:47] chjj: incredimike: "type" is the content-type header, but that doesnt matter, you can use the included middleware by doing..
[15:48] chjj: incredimike: app.use(parted.middleware({path:__dirname + '/uploads'}));
[15:48] chjj: it will give you a "body" object on the request, just like express does
[15:48] chjj: for files it will give you a temporary path to the file
[15:48] prettyrobots has joined the channel
[15:49] chjj: so you can do whatever you want with it
[15:49] chjj: by default, the upload directory is /tmp unless you specify it there
[15:49] stephank has joined the channel
[15:49] mannymanny: HI chjj why using parted instead of connect-form - formidable or formaline?
[15:49] adambeynon has joined the channel
[15:49] mannymanny: can you explain me a little?
[15:49] chjj: mannymanny: its just the multipart parser i wrote, im not trying to compete with formidable
[15:50] tjholowaychuk: the only downside to doing that before hitting a route is that you might want to bail on the upload after some logic in the route
[15:50] tjholowaychuk: too large or the user isnt authorized etc
[15:50] sneakyness: I'm not trying to sound bitter, but are there any -complete- node.js tutorials? I've followed at least 5 different multi-part todo examples, and none of them are finished 
[15:50] mannymanny: I ask only why is better!
[15:50] tjholowaychuk: chjj should send me a link though! or add it to the connect wiki
[15:50] chjj: tjholowaychuk: you can create a parser object yourself, and bind to events
[15:50] prettyrobots has joined the channel
[15:51] chjj: i should probably make a limit option, yeah
[15:51] chjj: sure, ill add it to the wiki
[15:51] tjholowaychuk: i have a limit() middleware
[15:51] tjholowaychuk: it's not perfect yet
[15:51] tjholowaychuk: but it should work fine
[15:52] chjj: yeah, i know, im not sure if i want to make some kind of specific limit option just for this parser, or allow people to limit it with the connect middleware
[15:52] tjholowaychuk: pretty much the same thing

[15:57] mcepl_ has joined the channel

[15:57] mcepl has joined the channel
[15:57] chjj: incredimike: you do have a limit option for the middleware by the way, you can do parted.middleware({limit:x}), with the size in bytes
[15:58] tjholowaychuk: express-expose just adds a string to an object
[15:58] aron_: It seems to be changing the .length properties of all previously bound functions
[15:58] tjholowaychuk: and adds it as a local
[15:58] tjholowaychuk: that's it
[15:58] slaskis: $ node
[15:58] slaskis: > require('events').EventEmitter.toString()
[15:58] aron_: eg. https://gist.github.com/afb829f0c18c03a7bb9e, any ideas?
[15:58] slaskis: 'function EventEmitter() { [native code] }'
[15:58] tjholowaychuk: oh, you were trying to expose an event emitter?
[15:58] tjholowaychuk: it's not really meant for anyyyyyyy node object

[17:42] hoodoos: so i decided to ask maybe there's some workaround or ways to solve this issue of mine

[19:44] ParadoxQuine has joined the channel

[19:45] Nuck: mrdoodles: I'm starting a startup with the same architecture
[19:45] mrdoodles: Nuck: i've busted out everything into mapped controllers, drop in models with mongoose and views with ejs. the mapping stores analytics info
[19:45] mrdoodles: Nuck: awesome!
[19:45] Nuck: But we're using Mongo-native
[19:46] Nuck: Because Mongoose is just too heavyweight for me
[19:46] mrdoodles: ahh
[19:46] Nuck: All I want is SQL-esque queryable JSON
[19:46] Nuck: It's something I've wanted for years
[19:46] Nuck: And with Mongo, I get it :D
[19:47] Nuck: I once tried to build a query system for JSON
[19:47] mrdoodles: they know i've been working startups since bubble #2, hah - but on php and ruby. they know I've just been doing node for a month. I'm actually reading a mongo book now, tomorrow's my first day
[19:47] mrdoodles: exactly mongo just makes sense
[19:47] Nuck: But Mongo is obviously faster, using BSON
[19:47] Aikar: Nuck: i'm using mongoskin currently and its being ok. though the doc is pretty bad
[19:47] Nuck: It really does Just Make Sense(tm)
[19:47] battlecollie has joined the channel
[19:48] Aikar: mostly follows mongo shell style
[19:48] Nuck: Aikar: Well, mongo-native is well-documented and is like if the Mongo console were async
[19:48] Aikar: Nuck: yeah mongoskin is a futures layer onto of mongo-native
[19:48] Nuck: mrdoodles: I'm going all the way with my startup, hopefully.
[19:48] Nuck: Aikar: Futures?
[19:48] mrdoodles: i love mongo, and i love mongoose, but yeah the docs :/
[19:48] mrdoodles: Nuck: are you in NYC?

[19:49] mrdoodles: i built the front end (they had a backend guy already) of frid.ge
[19:49] Aikar: Nuck:  var db = mongoskin.db('localhost/mydb'); var myfoocollection = db.collection('foo'); myfoocollection.find().each(function() { });

[19:52] Nuck: mrdoodles: 2-5 IIRC
[19:52] mrdoodles: paul graham in "on startups" said the magic number is 2-3
[19:52] mrdoodles: ahhh
[19:52] Nuck: We have more than the idea
[19:52] Nuck: *ideal
[19:52] Nuck: But we each play a very important role
[19:52] Nuck: We're all pretty young, self-taught programmers
[19:52] Aikar: Nuck: its pretty much same mongodb-native but you dont nest callbacks as much. 
[19:53] Nuck: Except the SA
[19:53] Aikar: makes using it a ton more friendly
[19:53] Nuck: Aikar: Might look into it.  Is it fully compatible with the code I already have?
[19:53] Aikar: should be very close.. the main diff is you dont have to wrap your code in a callback
[19:54] Aikar: ie db.collection('foo', function(col) { col.find();     becomes var foo = db.collection('foo'); foo.find()
[19:54] Nuck: Our SA is a well-educated man, very dedicated to the art of Server Administration, and he's willing to host us for free :D
[19:54] Nuck: I just learned programming very young

[20:36] Ratty_: May not work in <IE9
[20:36] Ratty_: Oh for Node it's cool :)
[20:37] guidocalvano: Ratty_: I will only support browsers, or things that run javascript (:
[20:37] garrensmith: mrdoodles: app.get("/some/page",my_auth_function, function() {}
[20:37] garrensmith: mrdoodles: call next() in my_auth_function and you good to go
[20:39] guidocalvano: which reminds me. I wonder how bad IE is doing (: let me check the browser usage statistics in great fondness

[21:12] djazz: franck34: oh, now it works!
[21:12] polotek: how does node-mysql handle transations? does it peg you to a connection?
[21:12] Nuck: Mongo is like SQL for JSON
[21:12] Nuck: 'nuff said
[21:12] djazz: i used several socket.write instead of one
[21:12] djazz: :S
[21:12] context: nuck: absolutely HORRIBLE explaination
[21:12] bloudermilk has joined the channel
[21:12] ekryski has left the channel
[21:12] Nuck: context: It has other benefits, too, but the one that always caught me was the fact that it's JSON with a query language.
[21:13] franck34: interesting
[21:13] Nuck: Which is something I'd wanted for YEARS
[21:13] Nuck: Mongo also has great sharding and scalability features
[21:13] Nuck: Replication is pretty good too, or so I hear
[21:13] franck34: mongo = fulltext search, view ?
[21:13] context: franck34: its a schema-less document store.
[21:14] Nuck: I believe it has fulltest search.
[21:14] Nuck: Not sure tho
[21:14] context: franck34: http://www.mongodb.org/
[21:14] context: you should try the internets, they has 'pages' explain its stuff
[21:14] franck34: i'll take a look. I'm using redis/mysql. Perhaps i can drop mysql ?
[21:14] context: they both have their purposes.
[21:15] ParadoxQuine has joined the channel
[21:15] Nuck: It's a similar scale to MySQL, a full-size database
[21:15] Nuck: But it's JSON
[21:15] Nuck: So it's nestable and such
[21:15] franck34: i need to store data and make complexe sql queries, and store result in redis, to be able to update a GUI using faye in realtime
[21:15] jokil: Nuck: comparing it to SQL is misleading. mongo is not relational
[21:15] Nuck: context: Sure, but I've yet to find a situation Mongo couldn't handle :P
[21:15] context: yes except you go NO acid compliance, no transactions, and no referencial integrety.
[21:15] bloudermilk: Howdy everyone. I'm currently evaluating node to serve as a simple HTTP reverse proxy. I was hoping to get some feedback on its usefulness in this field. I'd like to route to Rails http servers based on the reques's host
[21:16] Fabryz: Anyone knows how to preventDefault on everything BUT input fields?
[21:16] Nuck: jokil: What I mean is that it has a query language that provides similar capabilites to something like SQL
[21:16] context: nuck: tell any bank to move ti mongo they will probably kick you in the head and ensure your body is never found again.
[21:16] Fabryz: moving my char with arrows and using TAB for player score, but I don't want scrollbar to move NOR focus going around with tab

[21:16] bloudermilk: jokil: Thanks! I'll take a look
[21:16] polotek: bloudermilk: why use node for that?
[21:16] djazz: ws.send("AAA); --> <Buffer 81 83 7f 0c 13 32 3e 4d 52> :S
[21:17] Nuck: MySQL is pretty notorious for injection attacks
[21:17] polotek: wny not just nginx?
[21:17] TooTallNate: bnoordhuis: ryah: ugghhhh, I really didn't want it to come to this: https://github.com/bnoordhuis/node-buffertools/commit/f223aee7d0c08ee7e83802d662e9697a1b8c1db1
[21:17] Nuck: polotek: Well, Nginx sucks for revers proxy
[21:17] franck34: djazz: what is the problem ?
[21:17] bloudermilk: polotek: I was looking at nginx but it doesn't support websockets
[21:17] Nuck: It uses HTTP 1.0 to route to the servers
[21:17] djazz: i guess the protocol encodes the data somehow
[21:17] context: nuck: correct.
[21:17] bloudermilk: Also I'd like my router to be highly dynamic (adding new hosts on the fly w/o taking down everything)
[21:17] piscisaureus: abustin: ^
[21:18] franck34: bloudermilk: node is your solution :)

[21:18] DrMcKay has joined the channel
[21:19] Nuck: As in Mongo
[21:19] Nuck: You don't just concatenate a couple strings, you generate an object
[21:19] polotek: mysql is notorious for injection because nobody uses escape
[21:19] Nuck: polotek: It's hard to remember, and Node doesn't provide that, AFAIK
[21:19] Nuck: Prolly a module for it
[21:20] polotek: Nuck: correct, but that's not the fault of the db. use prepared statements
[21:20] franck34: djazz: ws.send(new Buffer("AAA").toString()) perhaps ?
[21:20] context: nuck: well people not using string escaping or an ORM deserve whatever they get
[21:20] djazz: ws.send is client browser code
[21:20] Nuck: polotek: Well, in the case of Mongo, there is no need to escape :P
[21:20] Nuck: context: ORM?
[21:20] Nuck: Fuck ORMs.
[21:20] Nuck: Mongo
[21:20] context: polotek: uhh injection has nothing to do with mysql.
[21:20] context: it can happen to ANY database.
[21:20] djazz: it dont use 0x00 DATA 0xFF framing
[21:20] franck34: djazz: and you receive a buffer node side ? decode it ! var str=new Buffer(response).toString();
[21:20] polotek: context: that's what I said
[21:21] Nuck: context: How do we inject into Mongo?
[21:21] djazz: i did, and i got unreadable chars
[21:21] context: why was injection even brought up
[21:21] Nuck: I've yet to figure that one out
[21:21] Nuck: And it's something that worries me
[21:21] franck34: djazz: can you sniff using ngrep or wireshark to see if your client is not sending stupid things ?
[21:22] Nuck: Somebody once said something about special chars, but I see no reason why that could break it
[21:22] djazz: i'll try in ff too, w8
[21:22] Nuck: You can't magically end the string through what's in the string
[21:22] polotek: Nuck: if you're building json strings manually or you're taking part of the string from user input, you can definitely cause problems in mongo
[21:22] Nuck: polotek: What, json strings?
[21:22] Nuck: JSON is an OBJECT
[21:22] Nuck: Input is stored inside strings inside that
[21:22] polotek: Nuck: no, json is a data format
[21:23] polotek: it's sent over the wire as a string
[21:23] bnoordhuis: TooTallNate: haha, you're watching buffertools?
[21:23] bnoordhuis: ugly isn't it?
[21:23] Nuck: polotek: You build it as an object, it gets encoded
[21:23] polotek: my point is that you can get a string an pass it straight to mongo
[21:23] franck34: after sql injection... mongo injection using json :)
[21:23] TooTallNate: bnoordhuis: there's gotta be a way to do that in the wscript...
[21:23] djazz: FF dont want to connect
[21:23] liveink has joined the channel
[21:23] Nuck: The strings are automatically escaped by the database connector
[21:23] Nuck: Nobody does raw Mongo
[21:23] Nuck: It's a complex protocol
[21:23] TooTallNate: bnoordhuis: but also, expecting every other native module out there to do that is asking a lot I think
[21:23] jokil: Nuck: that's an assumption about the database driver
[21:23] wink_: polotek: yes, but none of it is eval'd, mongo doesnt suffer those sorts of injection attacks
[21:24] Nuck: I'm pretty sure it's even encoded into BSON before sending
[21:24] jokil: mongo itself is not secure, it just so happens that most mongo drivers are not retarded
[21:24] wink_: it is definitely encoded to bson before sending
[21:24] Nuck: jokil: Not at all
[21:24] wink_: every single driver is encoding the json object into bson before it hits the wire
[21:24] bnoordhuis: TooTallNate: i think it's a bug in the 0.5.5 release, node-waf in the current master builds in build/default again
[21:24] Nuck: If it's encoded to JSON, the strings are escaped by the JS environment itself

[21:27] Nuck: user-generated keys and JS to be executed on the server
[21:27] Nuck: Yup, no issues there :P
[21:27] wink_: the data you're inserting does not mix with your query, unlike the string concatenated style of SQL querying
[21:27] Nuck: This should honestly be completely common-sense
[21:28] Nuck: wink_: Exactly, so I've got like a 5% chance of problems
[21:28] wink_: if you're programatically generating your query, then yeah, sure you could get junk injected
[21:28] Nuck: Nobody should be dumb enough to inject unescaped data into a JS environment
[21:28] Nuck: Just like how all JS coders know you never use eval()
[21:28] Nuck: Or setTimeout with a string
[21:28] polotek: haha, if nobody was dumb enough to do dumb things then the term sql injection wouldn't exist
[21:28] Nuck: fair enough
[21:29] Nuck: But JS coders have gotten used to these things in their environment
[21:29] wink_: i've used mongo for all sorts of horrible things, and i've yet to find a need to programatically generate the query.  i'd be interested to hear the use cases for doing so

[21:34] polotek: and try to strip the comments with really bad regexes
[21:34] Nuck: polotek: Yes, but in this case, the only injections that can be done are in very odd cases
[21:34] Nuck: Which the average idiot wouldn't use
[21:34] wink_: or be able to for that matter :p
[21:35] Nuck: Whereas in SQL, you basically NEED to insert input data into the string
[21:35] polotek: No, as soon as you allow injection into your data, you're vulnerable
[21:35] polotek:  maybe they can't mass delete things
[21:35] polotek: but you can do things like reset passwords
[21:35] Nuck: polotek: Eh?  Not really.

[21:36] bnjmn: hi i have a coworker who says node is a language and i say no it's not, and he says well then why does everyone say "I'm programming node"
[21:36] polotek: Nuck: I hope you're never proven wrong. Like i said, pointless argument
[21:36] Nuck: bnjmn: It's a platform basedo n the JS language
[21:36] tjholowaychuk: bnjmn hahah
[21:36] bnjmn: can I kill him please
[21:36] tjholowaychuk: no its not
[21:36] wink_: bnjmn: it's not a language :p
[21:37] bnjmn: well why do people say that then, is that a marketing strategy or something
[21:37] Nuck: It's sorta like saying you're coding Ruby
[21:37] balaa has joined the channel
[21:37] Nuck: Err, Rails
[21:37] Nuck: The language is technically Ruby
[21:37] wink_: its because it's javascript, but just saying that isnt really descriptive enough
[21:37] Nuck: But you can still program on a platform
[21:38] bnjmn: i'm just going to start saying "what? you're programming nude?"
[21:38] wink_: put your balls away!
[21:38] stash1: hey, is .pause() supposed to work for all 'data' events on node's ClientResponse?
[21:38] Nuck: It's a subset of the JS community and a superset of the JS language :D
[21:38] stash1: https://gist.github.com/1182108
[21:38] bnjmn: i'm programming semicolon
[21:39] polotek: stash1: no, pause is not guaranteed to stop all data events immediately

[21:42] abustin: does anyone know of a upnp node package that'll allow a node app to find other instances of itself 
[21:42] abustin: ... on the same internal network
[21:42] polotek: stash1: my personal opinion is don't pause. just buffer the data output for a bit, until you are ready to handle it.
[21:43] polotek: you should stick to stream piping as much as possible instead of handling data on your own
[21:43] draginx has joined the channel
[21:44] polotek: use something like the bufferedstream to help https://github.com/mikeal/morestreams
[21:44] draginx: For redisclient do I need only one instance for subscribing and another for pub or do I need one for each subscription to a "room"?
[21:44] stash1: well, the thing here is to decide if i need to filter the content or not
[21:44] mrdoodles: is there anything at all internally within express or the node bin to run in production or development? so instead of exporting a bash variable EXPRESS_ENV ....
[21:44] stash1: so the decision to .pipe is maybe later
[21:44] stash1: i'll check out bufferedstream, thank you.
[21:44] mrdoodles: anything like app.set("env", "production") ; ?
[21:44] tjholowaychuk: mrdoodles app.set('env', val)
[21:44] mrdoodles: ahh thx
[21:44] tjholowaychuk: but it is bad practice to hard-code that in
[21:45] tjholowaychuk: not sure why you would want to

[21:47] polotek: so you buffer until you decide if/how to filter, then you pipe it to the appropriate object.
[21:47] stash1: right, "filter or pass"

[22:16] mrdoodles: i don't "need" it. i was just running a tail from some middleware viewing memory etc and wanted to see active sessions or sessions or … anything
[22:17] mrdoodles: just not sure how to go about it?
[22:18] chapel: sessionStore
[22:18] Murvin: Hi.. i have a question regarding session in node.   In Symfony PHP, when a session is open, it will block all other threads accessing the session before it is closed.   does it have the same problem with node?  
[22:18] Murvin: how many concurrent sessions node can have?
[22:18] chapel: req.session and req.sessionStore properties will be accessible to all routes and subsequent middleware.
[22:19] chapel: Murvin: as many as your server can handle :)
[22:19] chapel: or your code for that matter
[22:19] chapel: node doesn't block on sessions
[22:20] Murvin: ok.  because my coworker happened to find out the session in symfony and Java will result in blocking siutation and thus, limit the # of concurrent sessions can have.   so i just want to make sure node is smart enough .. lol
[22:20] Murvin: and ..
[22:21] DrMcKay: ok, guys, I'm starting to maintain cradle (original author is unreacheable). any thoughs?
[22:21] Murvin: what about if I have my node running on multiple servers.   and the traffic is actually hitting the load balancer first, then send the request to one of the node servers.   How node handle session in this situation?

[22:22] DrMcKay: (my fork is at: https://github.com/mmalecki/cradle2 )
[22:22] racar has joined the channel
[22:22] chapel: Murvin: use a db sessionStore
[22:22] Murvin: let say, if the first time user hit the site and go to Node#1,   and get a session.  If the user hit the site again (in few seconds), and actually hit Node#2.  will he has the same session
[22:22] chapel: like connect-mongo or connect-redis
[22:22] chapel: whichever
[22:22] chapel: and then it uses the db to handle sessions
[22:22] Murvin: I'm using express.session   with connect-mongo  datastore.
[22:22] chapel: should be good

[23:39] SebastianFlyte has joined the channel
[23:39] Sembiance: mrdoodles: not I. I chose to use native-mongodb and json-schema and JSV over mongoose
[23:39] mrdoodles: hmmm
[23:40] mrdoodles: Sembiance: i guess i should look more into native-mongodb

[23:47] Sembiance: I use expressjs in a production site, and using it my my current project under development, but none of them have any 'state' so I've never used the session stuff from express
[23:47] mrdoodles: :/
