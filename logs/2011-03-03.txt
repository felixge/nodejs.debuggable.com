[00:29] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: nothing right now really, connect 1.x and express 2.x right away
[00:29] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: make sure connect's examples/session.js works for you

[00:32] tmzt: ?
[00:32] malkomalko: so does master of connect/express work together now with 0.4.1 or was that your comment about not right now really? I don't mind waiting it out

[00:34] tjholowaychuk: it has some patches that are needed

[02:32] mikegerwitz: fmarceau: I've used node's built-in assertions to test server-side and was able to test client-side by simply implementing the needed assertion methods and wrapping it in a closure (so require, etc work). But SubStack's solution is useful if you don't need a standlone thing.
[02:32] marcello3d: I think it has something to do with inconsistency and super loose commands that have multiple purposes
[02:32] mikegerwitz: standalone meaning, your project requiring no external libs
[02:33] marcello3d: I don't like foo() being both a getter and a setter
[02:33] WRA: you mean like html() vs html('') ?
[02:33] WRA: yeah
[02:33] WRA: I actually like that

[02:33] marcello3d: yea

[03:22] sechrist: I haven't seen a sudont in awhile
[03:22] Aria: In a different way, yes.
[03:22] sechrist: So is it now impossible to compromise a system with an npm package alone?

[04:20] SubStack: it would be much nicer if instead of mutating xs, .reverse() merely returned a new array (or better, a list!) with the elements in xs reversed
[04:21] Ikaros: @Aria (or anyone else) - the problem I'm having is that child_process.exec does not return anything I can rerun exec on so every call to exec is a new child process and has its cwd reset
[04:21] gkatsev: js: var xs = [ 7, 8, 9 ]; var ys = xs.reverse(); xs === ys
[04:21] gbot2: gkatsev: true
[04:21] SubStack: or if there were some nice way of annotating mutable functions like how ruby has the ! convention
[04:22] SubStack: because immutable interfaces are easier to reason about
[04:22] SubStack: although often it's handy to have mutable functions
[04:23] SubStack: but there's no way of telling beyond memorization whether a function is mutable or immutable
[04:23] marcello3d: isn't it scheme that uses ! for mutable?

[06:16] SubStack: super fun and you get a good handle on how to manage async complexity
[06:16] tpryme has joined the channel
[06:17] nornagon_: SubStack: it was very educational :) the main reason i wrote my own was because I wanted to be able to handle .on('success',cb).on('error',eb) as well as the combined cb(err,res) behaviours
[06:18] SubStack: yeah I have a few methods that sort of could be used for that purpose but I forget what they are so I never use them
[06:18] SubStack: and I don't talk about them in the docs
[06:18] meso_ has joined the channel
[06:19] andrewfff has joined the channel
[06:19] nornagon_: ah, heh
[06:20] SubStack: kevin_yb: did you upgrade node or npm on top of an existing installation?
[06:20] SubStack: also what is your $NODE_PATH?
[06:20] nornagon_: Step also looks interesting: https://github.com/creationix/step
[06:21] kevin_yb: SubStack: node path is unset... not managed by nvm?
[06:21] nornagon_: next thing i want to do is make it easy to splice in modular bits into a command flow.
[06:22] nornagon_: I find a lot of the time I'm doing things like Seq().seq(someHelper()), and in someHelper() there's code like var that = this; Seq().seq(...).seq(function () { ... that.next() })
[06:22] SubStack: you can nest stuff with .do()
[06:23] SubStack: chainsaw lets you do crazy nesting tricks like that
[06:23] SubStack: nornagon_: also if you want an explicit handle on `this` you can use the underscored methods
[06:23] SubStack: seq_(function (next) { next(null, 55) }) === seq(function () { this(null, 55) })
[06:24] SubStack: that just landed a few days ago so I can use seq in coffee script
[06:24] SubStack: since coffee doesn't rock the `this`
[06:27] nornagon_: ah
[06:27] kevin_yb: SubStack... what should node_path be set to?
[06:27] nornagon_: now i know why that's there :P
[06:28] tbranyen: am i the only one who likes callbacks :(
[06:28] nornagon_: the underscored methods don't really catch my fancy, but i see the value
[06:28] SubStack: kevin_yb: make sure it agrees with `npm -s config get root`
[06:28] tbranyen: seems everyone has a library out there to make flow "better"
[06:28] zemanel has joined the channel
[06:28] nornagon_: tbranyen: i just {
[06:29] nornagon_:   get a bit {
[06:29] nornagon_:     sick of {
[06:29] kevin_yb: kevins-macbook:basic kevinolsen$ npm -s config get root
[06:29] kevin_yb: kevins-macbook:basic kevinolsen$ echo $NODE_PATH
[06:29] nornagon_:       this.
[06:29] kevin_yb: shit
[06:29] tbranyen: nornagon_: you must hate if statements and classes
[06:29] nornagon_: tbranyen: the difference is that those things are actually hierarchical
[06:29] nornagon_: i want to think about flow as being linear
[06:30] kevin_yb: SubStack: https://gist.github.com/852431
[06:30] nornagon_: this, then that, then the other
[06:30] tbranyen: yeah thats exactly why i love callbacks
[06:30] tbranyen: do this and once its done encapsulate the next action
[06:30] nornagon_: yes
[06:31] SamuraiJack has joined the channel
[06:31] nornagon_: now try writing something that has to do 10 steps
[06:31] SubStack: tbranyen: there's no obvious solution I think is why there are so many flow control libraries
[06:31] tbranyen: break it out into named functions like you would if you had any code that went 10 steps deep
[06:32] SubStack: named functions is sometimes appropriate but not all problems break down that way
[06:32] nornagon_: agree
[06:32] tbranyen: SubStack: I'm not sure what you mean
[06:32] tbranyen: are you talking about losing closed vars in a higher scope or something?
[06:32] SubStack: you really do just need a good toolbox of approaches to manage async flow
[06:33] SubStack: tbranyen: not just losing scope but also having to come up with names for every trivial step
[06:33] tbranyen: seems like a contrived excuse
[06:33] SubStack: it really isn't
[06:33] SubStack: naming is really hard
[06:33] brianmario has joined the channel
[06:33] tbranyen: oh i agree
[06:33] tbranyen: but its hard for most things
[06:34] tbranyen: come up with a naming convention and stick to it
[06:34] SubStack: no
[06:34] SubStack: :p
[06:34] tbranyen: naming sucks, i hate naming temp vars too
[06:34] SubStack: I like structuring linear operations linearly
[06:34] tbranyen: end up using _
[06:34] fmarceau has joined the channel
[06:34] nornagon_: tbranyen: i hope i never have to read your code :P
[06:35] tbranyen: nornagon_: next week i'm releasing a node module
[06:35] tbranyen: i hope you find lots wrong with it
[06:35] nornagon_: <tbranyen> function _() { ... }; function __() { ... }     ;-p
[06:35] tbranyen: since i'm disconnected from the community :-p
[06:35] SubStack: tbranyen: yeah your code sounds terrible
[06:35] tbranyen: SubStack: mind taking a look at it?
[06:35] SubStack: abstractions can be nice
[06:36] tbranyen: you don't have to look at the code just the readme
[06:36] tbranyen: sec i'll gist

[06:37] tbranyen: hahaha isaacs 
[06:37] tbranyen: well its not funny but i had the next gist id :-/
[06:38] isaacs: oh, nice :)
[06:38] tbranyen: ah shit i did js instead of markdown
[06:38] tbranyen: SubStack: the api has since changed a little, but the concept is still the same
[06:38] tbranyen: no need for flow imo, seems to look nice as-is
[06:39] mape: what happened to the v0.4.2 tag?
[06:39] nornagon_: tbranyen: did you really put // If success will return 0, if an error message throw it as an error string. before every single if (err) { throw err }?
[06:39] tbranyen: yeah copy and paste is hard
[06:40] amerine has joined the channel
[06:40] nornagon_: but that's not even correct :P
[06:40] tbranyen: of course it is
[06:40] tbranyen: what do you mean?
[06:40] nornagon_: 'if success will return 0'
[06:40] tbranyen: yeah 0 indicates success
[06:40] tbranyen: in most libraries
[06:40] tbranyen: for err codes
[06:40] nornagon_: you mean 'if the operation succeeded, err will be null'?
[06:40] tbranyen: works really with if statements like this too, since 0 is the only number that evaluates falsy
[06:41] tbranyen: no err is literally the errcode 0
[06:41] nornagon_: i see
[06:41] tbranyen: if you do git.error().strError( 0 ); it will be // Unknown error aka success
[06:41] tbranyen: glad i put that comment in xD
[06:41] nornagon_: nothing's "returning" though
[06:42] tbranyen: yeah, that terminology could be tweaked
[06:42] tbranyen: return/be?
[06:42] nornagon_: / err will be 0 if the operation succeeded
[06:43] nornagon_: or something
[06:43] tbranyen: yea, less confusing wording
[06:43] nornagon_: also you don't really need to put "// lookup commit" before a line that says commit.lookup(...)
[06:43] nornagon_: like saying "// loop from 1 to 5" "for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) { ... }"
[06:44] andrewfff has joined the channel
[06:45] tbranyen: so... no issues with anything that is actually executed :D
[06:45] nornagon_: well
[06:45] nornagon_: personally i don't like having to put if (err) { throw err } at the beginning of every callback
[06:45] nornagon_: 1. because it's noise
[06:45] tbranyen: then don't
[06:46] tbranyen: its not like the code will break if you don't
[06:46] nornagon_: sure it will
[06:46] nornagon_: 2. because if that throws out of the cb, it will kill the whole node process
[06:46] nornagon_: not good in, say, a webserver which is serving 1000s of queries per second :P
[06:47] nornagon_: in fact that code could break very badly if you don't check err
[06:47] tbranyen: that convention was pulled directly from the node docs iirc
[06:47] nornagon_: consider "fs.rename(path.join(p, 'etc'))"
[06:47] nornagon_: if p == null
[06:47] nornagon_: because there was an err
[06:48] nornagon_: that will just rename some random directory called etc somewhere
[06:48] tbranyen: and everything you are pointing out is not a flaw in my api, its trivial banter that is easily corrected with a try/catch or process.uncaughtException
[06:48] olegp has left the channel
[06:48] nornagon_: process.uncaughtException has its own problems
[06:48] olegp has joined the channel
[06:48] nornagon_: the point is that flow control libraries can make all this stuff a lot easier
[06:48] tbranyen: nornagon_: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.2/api/fs.html#fs.readFile
[06:49] nornagon_: yes, i know that's the node convention
[06:49] tbranyen: i don't see how a flow control library would help anything you've just pointed out
[06:49] tbranyen: that you couldn't easily do on your own
[06:49] nornagon_: sure it's easy
[06:49] nornagon_: sure you can do it every time you need to
[06:49] tbranyen: nobody is putting a gun to the endusers head to throw on every error
[06:49] tbranyen: log it some other way
[06:49] nornagon_: but you can get a library to help you
[06:50] nornagon_: and that frees up your brain so you can think about other things
[06:50] Sebmaster has joined the channel
[06:50] tbranyen: hmmm i guess that doesn't really sell it for me
[06:50] nornagon_: i'd just rather be writing the code that's actually interesting
[06:51] nornagon_: instead of if (err) { throw err }
[06:51] nornagon_: in every single callback
[06:51] tbranyen: i'm not sure i can alter this api to accomodate that
[06:51] tbranyen: not sure how a flow approach would help that much either
[06:51] nornagon_: in the outward-facing api it doesn't matter
[06:51] nornagon_: i can easily use my flow control library to wrap your api
[06:52] nornagon_: because i designed it for exactly that
[06:52] nornagon_: so you can do whatever
[06:52] nornagon_: and i can use it in a nice way :)
[06:52] tbranyen: how will it know if an error occurred?
[06:52] mikeal has joined the channel
[06:52] nornagon_: did you read the readme?
[06:52] nornagon_: because it says there :)
[06:52] tbranyen: no i just know my code
[06:52] nornagon_: https://github.com/nornagon/node-conseq
[06:54] kevin_yb: SubStack: any ideas? nothing doing with exporting NODE_PATH
[06:54] kevin_yb: node seems to be able to see my nvm directory just fine
[06:54] tbranyen: nornagon_: that's interesting, not sure if it really "frees" you from the clutter
[06:54] tbranyen: seems like you're stuck still adding that on('error', err)
[06:54] nornagon_: sure
[06:55] nornagon_: but i can handle all the errors for the flow in one place
[06:55] nornagon_: and that on('error') thing is to deal with apis that use eventemitters
[06:55] tbranyen: yeah i can write a function called handleError and do the same thing
[06:55] nornagon_: if you're using the cb(err, res) convention
[06:55] nornagon_: you can use this.combined instead of this.next
[06:55] SubStack: kevin_yb: is it a fresh install?
[06:55] nornagon_: and it checks the err for you
[06:56] tbranyen: ha didn't realize you wrote that
[06:57] nornagon_: also have fun running several things in parallel and calling a callback when all of them have completed without some kind of 'flow control library'
[06:57] kevin_yb: SubStack: dude i totally rebooted like 3 times, killed a chicken, offered it to satan, etc... 
[06:57] SubStack: kevin_yb: that's not what I mean
[06:57] tbranyen: nornagon_: i will, its called deferreds ;-)
[06:57] SubStack: rebooting? what the fuck
[06:58] tbranyen: i don't need a whole library to handle that
[06:58] kevin_yb: whats fucked is i can require everything but express
[06:58] kevin_yb: all other packages installed by npm are cool
[06:58] SubStack: npm rm express@version
[06:58] SubStack: then install it again
[06:59] SubStack: the reason why I asked if your node+npm combo was a fresh install was because shim modules went away and if you have them around still then your shit will break
[06:59] kevin_yb: all fresh as of this evening
[06:59] dustym has joined the channel
[06:59] isaacs: kevin_yb: old versions of express do not work with new versions of npm
[07:00] kevin_yb: rm'ed installed 1.0.7 and its all good
[07:00] isaacs: great
[07:00] SubStack: it's also rather easy to think that you've uninstalled everything
[07:00] kevin_yb: thanks man! seriously stumped for about 2 hours now.
[07:00] SubStack: but then fragments linger and fuck up your packages
[07:01] kevin_yb: i had a pretty clean environment starting out, but yeah. churning will get you into weird states.
[07:01] kevin_yb: thanks all!

[09:00] Aria: (libev has one gotcha if you're not careful, though)

[11:43] AAA_awright: That should work at least

[11:44] jetienne: this.inBrowser	= typeof window === "object"; <- so something like this ?
[11:45] AAA_awright: That should work, but why do you need to make the check at all?

[11:50] AAA_awright: But in any event that should work, testing for window

[11:57] tmzt: it's not User-Agent: sniffing, it's pretty sound, though compressed js is the same as normal js
[11:58] jetienne: tmzt: i think there is a misunderstanding. im just willing to know how to detect when my js is running from js. like if inbrowser, dont read local config file, but on node, do it

[12:52] jpstrikesback: SubStack++
[12:52] SubStack: well in building a game you'll have different sorts of trade-offs depending on the type of event
[12:53] SubStack: if you need low-latency object access you can use browserify to use some of your server-side model and validation code on the browser
[12:53] SubStack: and then when you want to push data to and from the server you can use dnode
[12:54] lolninja: ah cool
[12:55] lolninja: so is dnode RMI over socket.io?
[12:56] SubStack: socket.io or regular tcp sockets
[12:56] SubStack: dnode is more about the protocol than the transport
[12:57] SubStack: the v0.6 branch has a better readme https://github.com/substack/dnode/tree/v0.6 
[12:57] SubStack: it will land once socket.io gets a tiny update

[13:05] piscisaureus: I wonder why this has so much effect why when crankshaft landed on x32 initally almost no improvement was visible
[13:05] mraleph: hmm.
[13:05] mraleph: no it was visible.
[13:06] piscisaureus: yeah but not like almost double v8 score
[13:06] mraleph: there was no nice drops on AWFY because it was not working at that moment.
[13:06] mraleph: actually it doubled v8 score :-)
[13:07] omac has left the channel
[13:07] mraleph: "Overall, Crankshaft boosts V8â€™s performance by 50% on the V8 benchmark suite." this is quote from release blog post from December.

[13:09] piscisaureus: mraleph: but to be honest, I barely noticed any perf increase in december and I kinda dismissed that 50% increase statement as PR bs
[13:09] piscisaureus: no intent to hurt your feelings
[13:09] piscisaureus: I the x64 bench shows that crankshaft does live up to its promise
[13:10] meso_ has joined the channel
[13:10] piscisaureus: Could be there were (are?) some issues with crankshaft not working well for node
[13:11] argb: Node will be able to fork new processes (using the Web Workers API ) which fits well into the current design. when will implement the promise?
[13:12] skohorn has joined the channel
[13:13] mraleph: piscisaureus: without profiling it's hard to say what really happens. it can be that really hot functions in node are non-(yet)-optimizable by crankshaft. e.g. they contain dreaded try-catch.
[13:14] mraleph: piscisaureus: or it might be that node profile is actully to flat so the real time is spent in C++.
[13:14] piscisaureus: mraleph: there are some benchmarks now that test raw JS performance I believe

[13:18] piscisaureus: mraleph: you should look at node-mysql. It's performance is very much js-bound and there are perf issues with it that nobody understands
[13:19] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[13:19] mraleph: on the top of the profile there are lookups in of Object properties performed in C++ runtime. It seems that node is either using some object(s) as a hashtable on a fast path or it some pretty important objects went slowcase for some reason. 
[13:19] mraleph: this is not good for performance.

[13:30] mraleph: piscisaureus: but I really think that Crankshaft has a great potential and it should improve perf of some node.js applications. 
[13:31] mikegerwitz: mraleph: Heh, never actually used it :) Only OpenBSD briefly

[13:32] piscisaureus: good for him. Bank the money
[13:32] mraleph: :-)
[13:32] piscisaureus: I wondered whether it could be that v8 doesn't do fastapi optimization in a particular context
[13:33] piscisaureus: I know for sure that the first few times that buffer.toString is called in your node app it goes slow-case
[13:34] piscisaureus: well, that was a few months ago anyway. I saw it when stepping through v8 code with a disassembler.
[13:34] piscisaureus: that were sucky times

[13:42] piscisaureus: Ah. felixge just tweeted something, so I think he has time :-)
[13:42] mraleph: like what the magic happens with this toString or whatever.
[13:44] mraleph: *sigh* macbook battery life sucks latelyâ€¦ guess I need to replace it.

[13:44] Aikar: http://www.arewefastyet.com/awfy2.php?runs=8000&machine=8    64bit v8 is showing a huge speed imprvement
[13:45] mscdex: replace the macbook?
[13:45] mscdex: :D
[13:45] Aikar: just a few days ago
[13:45] mraleph: Aikar: that's crankshaft for you! just turned it on by default for x64 and arm today :-)
[13:45] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[13:45] Aikar: ahh :OO
[13:46] Aikar: so its been on for 32bit and the benchs for 32 are still at 7000?
[13:46] lolninja: SubStack: I've had a quick read of the documentation on your .net, and I think dnode will be ideal for my eventual server/server and server/client code. I think I understand most of whats going on, but I'll need to dig deeper so I understand how the remote callbacks are working and if there are any related security issues. Thanks for the heads up.
[13:46] mraleph: mscdex: I see no reason to replace macbook (well it is small and niceish and only 2 years old).
[13:46] Aikar: cause the 32bit graph isnt showing a drop

[13:47] matclayton has joined the channel
[13:47] mraleph: Aikar: then we started porting it to arm and x64
[13:47] Aikar: so 64bit is drastically faster than 32?
[13:47] mraleph: I don't think so. It probably depends on the usage.
[13:47] mscdex: is crankshaft enabled by default with node?
[13:47] Aikar: wait hld on these graphs are not the same o.o
[13:48] mraleph: :-)
[13:48] Aikar: oh ok i thought lower was at bottom
[13:49] Aikar: so 32 is faster atm

[13:54] mraleph: sorry freaking paid wifi expired
[13:54] rjrodger_: see that's that what I though - but it behaves differently - e.g. module.exports = function() {} works just fine, but exports = function() {} does not - TypeError: object is not a function at Object.CALL_NON_FUNCTION (native)

[13:54] jbergstroem: 
[13:54] mraleph: argh. when communism finally wins and wifi will be free everywhere?
[13:55] rjrodger_: used as: myfunc = require('./mymodule')
[13:55] mscdex: rjrodger_: yeah, if you're overwriting exports you have to use module.exports = {foo: 'bar'}
[13:55] saschagehlich has joined the channel
[13:55] mscdex: but if you just want to attach stuff you can use exports.foo = 'bar'
[13:56] rjrodger_: ok - any idea why? does plain exports just create a local object?
[13:57] altamic has joined the channel
[13:57] MikhX has joined the channel
[13:58] mikegerwitz: rjrodger_: All node does is wrap your module in a function. The exports argument passed to that function is a reference to module.exports
[13:59] mscdex: rjrodger_: yeah, exports is a local variable
[13:59] mikegerwitz: rjrodger_: Setting exports removes that reference.
[13:59] rjrodger_: makes sense! tx
[14:00] rjrodger_: serves me right for believing in magic
[14:00] mikegerwitz: Speaking of which - is it ever frowned upon for replacing module.exports with a function? I'm unaware of the implications, but I've wanted to do it in the past. Just want to make sure it won't break anything in the future.
[14:01] SubStack: I do that all the time
[14:01] mikegerwitz: SubStack: Oh, great :) 
[14:01] rjrodger_: mikegerwitz: i've seen it done it quite a few modules
[14:02] SubStack: another fun thing is that functions are objects too so you can set attributes

[14:27] Gruni has joined the channel
[14:27] jmar777: eventi: it created an http client for the specified port/host. look here: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.2.6/api.html#http-client-183

[14:28] eventi: old docs are so pretty :) - Thanks
[14:29] mikegerwitz: eventi: Heh, I do prefer the old docs myself. I develop in a terminal and a very dark gvim theme, so the new documentation is blinding ._.

[14:36] AnimaSana: the only realtime game I have seen so far, is wordsquared (previously knows as scribb.ly)

[14:42] AnimaSana: using node.js this time?
[14:43] atiti: maybe ;)
[14:43] atiti: also need some websockets or some server push
[14:44] atiti: cos polling is ugllyy
[14:44] AnimaSana: true... so pusher or socket.io or something else right?
[14:44] atiti: ye i guess
[14:44] AnimaSana: why do I get the feeling that node.js + websockets is what Flash Media Server has been doing years ago? :P
[14:45] atiti: im rather new to node.js
[14:45] AnimaSana: has anyone worked with FCS or FMS before?
[14:45] jetienne: AnimaSana: still true on firefox :) 
[14:45] jetienne: AnimaSana: socket.io uses flash on firefox. and the ping time is the same as real websocket
[14:45] aabt has joined the channel
[14:46] AnimaSana: jetienne: yeap it falls back on flash if the browser does not support websockets
[14:46] davidc_: websockets "can" use flash rather.
[14:46] davidc_: AnimaSana: precisely.
[14:46] atiti: sounds like what i need
[14:47] MrSteve has joined the channel
[14:47] jetienne: davidc_: ? websocket are websocket. no flash in there
[14:47] davidc_: And websockets are essentially polling :P Only difference is that they aren't standardized yet
[14:47] davidc_: jetienne: exactly :)
[14:47] davidc_: Oh sorry I thought you said websockets use flash on firefox, but I see you mentioned "socket.io"
[14:48] jetienne: atiti: if you condere using a external service, you can use pusher or easywebsocket
[14:48] jetienne: considere
[14:48] SubStack: AnimaSana: and java applets before that
[14:48] eee_c has joined the channel
[14:48] SubStack: the nice thing about design is you can scrap tech and start over now and then
[14:48] pascalopitz: I thought websocket != polling?
[14:48] davidc_: java applets had a great potential for distributed computing, shame that they sucked so much :P
[14:48] AnimaSana: SubStack: the thing with Flash Media Server is that it was always well built, java applets sucked
[14:49] jetienne: pascalopitz: websocket is a tcp connection. this is bidirectional and remain established
[14:49] SubStack: a media server doesn't sound terribly composable
[14:49] pascalopitz: exactly
[14:49] davglass has joined the channel
[14:49] SubStack: and probably cost money to get licensing for
[14:49] matyr_ has joined the channel

[14:51] AnimaSana: is pusher something far different than socket.io? is it socket.io provided as a service?
[14:51] jetienne: 'websocket', 'flashsocket', 'htmlfile', 'xhr-multipart', 'xhr-polling' <-  dunno which one is called "comet"
[14:51] SubStack: I don't care how stuff works underneath, I just want to be able to achieve certain ends
[14:51] jetienne: AnimaSana: they handle the service for you
[14:51] zachsmith has joined the channel
[14:51] pascalopitz: davidc_: I thought websockets was a standard?

[14:52] davidc_: jetienne: it's an unfinished standards afaik.
[14:52] davidc_: Widely used agreed.
[14:52] AnimaSana: jetienne: so you pay pusher, to have websockets as a scalable service
[14:52] jetienne: AnimaSana: i dont. but yep this is the principle
[14:53] jetienne: AnimaSana: i dont because i run a free alternative to pusher :) http://easywebsocket.org
[14:53] marcello3d has joined the channel
[14:53] AphelionZ has joined the channel
[14:54] AnimaSana: jetienne: so we can use your service? :)
[14:54] Gruni has joined the channel
[14:54] davidc_: pascalopitz: jetienne: Both the API and the protocol aren't standardized yet. The W3C is still working on standardizing the API while the IETF is still standardizing the protocol.
[14:54] jetienne: AnimaSana: you can use it. or clone it and run the server yourself. 
[14:55] miketaylr has joined the channel
[14:55] AnimaSana: jetienne: in the second case, what benefits do I have over socket.io?
[14:55] atiti: hmm
[14:55] atiti: jetienne, how come www.easywebsocket.org points to a different site than easywebsocket.org ?
[14:56] davidc_: Should you need more information: WebSockets protocol draftâ€”last updated 25th Febâ€”http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol-06, and http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/ is the W3C API draft edited last on 28th Feb.
[14:56] jetienne: AnimaSana: easywebsocket got 2 versions. google appengine or node. the node version is basically a wrapper on top of socket.io
[14:56] AnimaSana: interesting...
[14:56] jetienne: AnimaSana: with websocket api. so you get not to write/maintain the code 
[14:56] jetienne: atiti: because im a bad admin :)
[14:57] fmarceau has joined the channel
[14:57] jetienne: AnimaSana: and not to run the server, if you use the service instead of running it on your own server
[14:57] AnimaSana: jetienne: I  abandoned GAE a few months ago, BigTable was making me sad :P
[14:57] jetienne: AnimaSana: the perf on top of GAE are real slow compared to actual websocket
[14:57] matschaffer has joined the channel
[14:58] bergie has joined the channel
[14:58] jetienne: AnimaSana: like gae ~= 10 slower than node
[14:58] marcello3d has joined the channel
[14:58] pascalopitz: davidc_: I think there's little point in waiting for the Wc3 to formalize the standard officially when it's already incorpotrated in webkit and will be in mozilla
[14:58] jetienne: AnimaSana: gae did a choise of using wellknown tech, aka a http get every 100ms or so
[14:58] seivan has joined the channel
[14:58] davidc_: pascalopitz: It's so ready taht Firefox pulled out last November because of some security issues discovered in the protocol.
[14:59] jetienne: http://easywebsocket.org/contrib/monitor/ for current perf
[14:59] AnimaSana: jetienne: I think using node and hosting on Joyent no.de is the best way to go, or one of the best ways to go
[14:59] MrTopf has joined the channel
[15:00] jetienne: davidc_: api is ready, security issue is being worked out.
[15:00] jetienne: AnimaSana: i got my no.de coupon 2days ago. currently hosted on my own server. i will provide easy way to push on no.de and nodester
[15:00] davidc_: jetienne: I'm not disputing the fact that websockets is ready to use but one can't say that the API or the protocol is already a standard.
[15:01] davidc_: I use websockets and I love them.
[15:01] davidc_: LOVE
[15:01] jetienne: davidc_: most html5 isnt tho :)
[15:01] davidc_: Exactly :)
[15:01] jetienne: AnimaSana: i expect to port to no.de this weekend
[15:01] pascalopitz: but at the same time w3c have a history of being late when it comes to formalizing a standard
[15:01] jetienne: pascalopitz: yep no worry about the api. it will not change
[15:01] stagas_ has joined the channel
[15:02] pascalopitz: oh, i'll just use socket.IO and don't worry about the abstraction
[15:02] pascalopitz: :p

[15:02] Muon: pascalopitz++
[15:02] Muon: hm
[15:02] davidc_: pascalopitz: That's what I do :) Use socket.io and hope for the best for the future.

[15:02] Muon: where's v8bot?
[15:03] jetienne: AnimaSana: thanks

[15:04] Muon: how so?
[15:04] jetienne: eventi: e.g. on nodester, you need to address your app directly (and not the http proxy) so you need the tcp port from your account

[15:42] pascalopitz: nice, will watch that
[15:43] stagas: jetienne: google translate sucks, what does it say?
[15:44] jetienne: stagas: amis qui travaille dans la programmation ou pas j'ai un bon site pour trouvÃ© des info en tous genre ici http://hwknd.com/ == "friends working in programming or not, i found a good site to find info of any kind. here http://hwknd.Com'
[15:45] pascalopitz: you beat me to it

[15:45] pascalopitz: my french is rusty though

[15:45] pascalopitz: so not so much an attack as more of a normal usage?
[15:46] stagas: well normal usage was 2-3 people a day :P
[15:46] stagas: it's strange to see just one country lighten up
[15:46] pascalopitz: I hope it scales beyond that
