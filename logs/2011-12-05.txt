[00:27] wereHamster: is there a way to get the FQDN from node?
[00:27] wereHamster: os.hostname() only returns the hostname
[00:28] Tobsn: you mean like HTTP_HOST from which the request comes from?
[00:28] wereHamster: no. I mean the FQDN of the machine that node is runnign on
[00:28] Tobsn: oh
[00:28] Tobsn: dont think so
[00:29] Tobsn: you can browse around in the network code and see if there is some var for it
[00:29] Tobsn: but besides the hostname i dont think you get anything better

[00:39] Tobsn: Labmonkey1, i actually never saw flash working, but it also never looked into it
[00:39] kn0where: you could try setting it to use Flash only
[00:39] Labmonkey1: im just running in IE
[00:39] Tobsn: hmm
[00:40] fzzzy has joined the channel
[00:40] Labmonkey1: the website says to set WEB_SOCKET_SWF_LOCATION
[00:40] Tobsn: try putting all on one single domain, all in the same folder and force it to use flash like kn0where said
[00:40] Emmanuel has joined the channel
[00:40] Labmonkey1: I can't do that, there is more than one server
[00:40] Tobsn: hmm dont know if that will fuck it up
[00:40] Tobsn: esp if you use different domains
[00:41] Tobsn: i got it running half a year ago and never touched it again
[00:41] Labmonkey1: it all works except for flash
[00:41] Tobsn: cause its a very brittle little lib
[00:41] matejv has joined the channel
[00:41] Tobsn: did you tried to set the swf location?
[00:41] Tobsn: maybe the module cant find it
[00:41] Labmonkey1: im not sure im doing it right
[00:41] Tobsn: btw. you know they have a channel only for socket.io?
[00:41] Tobsn: #socket.io i think
[00:41] Labmonkey1: I did not
[00:42] Tobsn: grauch etc. are in there
[00:42] Tobsn: rauchg whatever
[00:42] Tobsn: hehe
[00:42] Labmonkey1: but yea, I set WEB_SOCKET_SWF_LOCATION = "thelocation"
[00:42] Labmonkey1: but I don't think that's right
[00:42] Labmonkey1: because I can't find WEB_SOCKET_SWF_LOCATION referenced anywhere
[00:42] Tobsn: yeah ask in socket.io, those guys are all into it, they might know it by heart

[02:26] JakeSays: node-inspector doesnt work with v0.6x i lbelieve
[02:27] JesusRosso: tonymilne, I'm listening uncaughtException. I think that is a internal problem of node 6.4
[02:27] JakeSays: JesusRosso: upgrade to 6.5

[02:31] JesusRosso: JakeSays,  Yes I was reading the changelog, anyway I'm compiling 6.5 right now to try.

[02:34] JesusRosso: JakeSays, I will try. But I think that is a problem of the node binary, because I'm printing the errors on 'uncaughtException' and I don't see anything when node dies.
[02:35] JesusRosso: same problem with node 6.5 :(

[03:13] Guest68355: what's the criteria to look out in a linux distro for node as a server for a large real time app?
[03:13] Aria: "Modern C++ compiler"
[03:13] Guest68355: any thoughts?
[03:14] Aria: node is pretty isolated. I like having something modern for supporting tools, but node itself isn't so picky.

[03:15] Aria: Yeah. It's really not that picky.
[03:15] Guest68355: sweet, thanks

[03:30] JakeSays: tonymilne: yes - keys. i have a big array of objects that i'm cleaning up
[03:30] JakeSays: so i wrote a little script to fix them and write them back out
[03:30] JakeSays: and yeah, it doesnt matter, just kind of ugly
[03:30] Guest68355: nop
[03:31] Aria: json technically always has the names quoted.
[03:31] JakeSays: i know
[03:32] JakeSays: but these are really object literals in source code

[04:47] tonymilne has joined the channel
[04:47] joshsmith: Cerales: it's likely refusing because you don't have authorization to access whatever resource you're connecting to
[04:48] Cerales: yeah, it's an expected behaviour
[04:48] Cerales: but i can't figure out how to catch the error
[04:48] Cerales: it's just throwing out and killing the process
[04:48] joshsmith: ohh gotcha
[04:48] skunkape: anybody here using no.de smarthosts?
[04:50] joshsmith: Cerales: I'd consider throwing that question up on StackOverflow
[04:50] joshsmith: it'll be good for others to have that resource in the future
[04:50] Cerales: joshsmith: will do!
[04:51] joshsmith: Cerales: cool. sorry I can't help

[06:18] tonymilne: kerang curl -X PUT 'http://shadow-npm.net/rego?admins=you&readers=jim,paul,emma'
[06:18] kerang: tonymilne: the documentation only says about registering users to shadow-npm.net , does it mean shadow-npm is a centralised service on the cloud ?
[06:18] tonymilne: implies you can create on on his server,
[06:19] kerang: so my private modules will be published on his couchdb on shadow-npm.net ?
[06:19] tonymilne: yeah, i guess if you did that, but I'm sure you could get it running locally.
[06:19] tonymilne: kerang do you use git in your workflow?
[06:19] tonymilne: you can just use npm without publishing to everyone.
[06:20] kerang: tonymilne: if my private modules need to be published to shadow-npm.net, then it defeats the purpose of "private" there..
[06:20] kerang: tonymilne: i don't want to replicate the whole npm registry, hence i'm looking at shadow-npm

[06:28] kerang: tonymilne: so we put a workaround , adding 'latest' label/tag/etc for the latest version, but then the url gets cached by our proxy layer
[06:29] tonymilne: hmm, thats disappointing :(
[06:30] kerang: tonymilne: at the end of the day, that technique mentioned on debuggable article is a workaround... the proper way is to have a local npm repo really, that's why i'm keen on setting up shadow-npm internally with our local couchdb.. but yea, the documentation is lacking

[06:32] tlrobinson: if your program only does disk IO (with a single disk) is it likely to run faster with the synchronous APIs?

[06:33] mraleph has joined the channel
[06:33] lietu: I can't seem to find any documentation on how to read data from a socket when doing "new net.createServer().on('connection', function(socket) {});" ... I can get in the socket, and it seems to have a lot of functions, but I can't find a "read()" or similar ... anyone point me to the right direction?

[06:33] fangel has joined the channel
[06:34] tlrobinson: tonymilne: i understand it blocks, and i don't care. it's not serving web requests, just a command line utility doing some disk io
[06:34] kerang: tonymilne: sure thanks :)... i'm beginning to question how these elite node.js folks will handle  these insanely large number of projects...  look at how many pull requests went ignored for many months... not one person can possibly maintain 90 projects really...

[06:36] tlrobinson: i'm just wondering if there is any performance0 advantage to using async APIs if all I'm doing is reading from disk
[06:36] kerang: tlrobinson: disk reading is still IO, right? then it shouldn't be blocking, no?
[06:38] tlrobinson: kerang: not necessarily. you can only read one thing from a disk at a time
[06:38] tonymilne: tlrobinson without checking node source, i imagine that it will be very minor. E.g. the difference between a return vs calling a function that was passed in. The underlying mechanism for performing the disk read will be equivalent. 
[06:39] thepatr1ck: lietu: reading is net.createServer().on('connection', function(socket) {}).on('data', function(data){ … })
[06:39] nzjames has left the channel
[06:39] lietu: thepatr1ck, thanks, I *just* figured that out 2 seconds earlier ;)
[06:39] kerang: tlrobinson: only one disk head? if all you're doing is reading from disk, yea...  unless you have other things that's cpu-bound, then sync should be better then
[06:39] Tobsn: is it just me or is google.com down?
[06:39] Tobsn: hmm back
[06:39] kerang: Tobsn: up fer me
[06:39] Tobsn: it was unreachable for ~30
[06:40] tlrobinson: tonymilne: i'm not sure that's true. i was under the impression the sync fs methods were added because of the overhead of the event loop was too much for certain scenarios dealing with the fs
[06:40] satyr has joined the channel
[06:40] thepatr1ck: lietu: node'll do that :)
[06:40] neilk_ has joined the channel
[06:41] tonymilne: tlrobinson I would assume that sync methods were added for convenience during startup routines etc, where you know that you need to block the app init process until certain things are done, e.g. read config from file, etc.

[10:23] elliottcable: what files it's trying to find? What do you mean?
[10:23] spolu_ has joined the channel
[10:24] lietu: if it says "Error: Unable to load shared library", it's most likely trying to load a shared library from some file
[10:24] benvie: is this windows or no?
[10:24] elliottcable: googling has run across an obscure sidenote on a README for a completely unrelated project that says something about it causing “Error: Unable to load shared library” ;;; “If you forget to instantiate a static member in the .cc file”
[10:24] elliottcable: but I've no idea what that means
[10:24] benvie: I have experience witht his on windows, not other
[10:24] elliottcable: I'm a C++ noob /=
[10:24] rwasiele_ has joined the channel
[10:24] elliottcable: benvie: this is Linux, but the problem has nothing to do with the platform; it's some sort of C++ thing
[10:25] benvie: in windows it means it couldn't find the library because you either have it in the wrong place, named it wrong, or you linked it against a file node named node.exe
[10:25] elliottcable: currently reading http://stackoverflow.com/a/1825872/31897, trying to grok it
[10:25] elliottcable: benvie: no, it's none of those;
[10:25] lietu: elliottcable, ah, if you create for example a static foo::bar foobar in the .h file, it will just mean that it exists somewhere, but you don't actually create the data there, you have to put a similar statement in a .cc/cpp/whatever file
[10:25] elliottcable: as I said, this works fine until I comment out a particular line of code
[10:25] benvie: well it's related to that basically
[10:25] benvie: it can't find the .node file for some reason
[10:25] benvie: this is pre-loading the file
[10:25] elliottcable: that absolutely cannot be right o_o
[10:25] lietu: I think the correct words are declare vs. define, one you do in the header, one in the .cc/cpp
[10:25] elliottcable: because the exact same everything works fine, until I uncomment that line

[10:26] lietu: is "Window::Constructor()" from your code?

[10:27] elliottcable: lietu: yes, up above; line 32+
[10:27] benvie: oh my a window
[10:27] benvie: that sounds like you're doing stuff I care about
[10:27] elliottcable: A window!
[10:27] elliottcable: benvie: *eyebrow*, what?
[10:27] benvie: I spend way too much time doing things that involve DOM stuff in node
[10:28] elliottcable: heh, this isn't DOM, unfortunately. That'd be a piece of cake compared to this crap. Ncurses, C++, doing my head in. >:
[10:28] benvie: like spending the whole weekend writing a new IDL to JS generator dom.js 
[10:28] lietu: ah yeah, could be that it's having issues finding it because it's in the "prototype", instead of first declared in a header and then defined in a .cc file
[10:28] benvie: lame
[10:29] lietu: C++ is sometimes quite painful, if you don't stick to a strict standard on where to put what sort of code
[10:30] elliottcable: I'm an oldschool, long-time ISO C coder
[10:30] elliottcable: so I'm quite proficient with things like that
[10:30] elliottcable: at least generally. The C++ stuff with its damn classes and templates and umpteen definitions for the “static” keyword and etcetcetc are doing my head in, though.

[10:33] elliottcable: conjoined Node-writing twins?
[10:33] lietu: hehe ... well, c coders often have issues understanding many things ;) ... but I think this could start working if you just moved the class prototype to a header file and then defined the functions in a separate file ... could also be that the Window::Constructor isn't resolving correctly ... I try to avoid all that crap with namespaces, by always having my function definitions outside any namespace {} -blocks and always strictly defining the "full path
[10:33] lietu: " to the code, e.g. std::cout, instead of namespace std; and plain cout

[10:34] benvie: ultimately I'm working on running Chromium in a node process using v8 isolates but there's other related things like being able to keep a remote and local DOM document synced transparently
[10:35] benvie: behind the scenes
[10:35] benvie: and to do that you first need a good DOM implementation in node
[10:35] benvie: there's other benefits to having a good IDL to JS generator as well since IDL is used for a bunch of things
[10:36] elliottcable: benvie: what are you doing re: Chromium ∪ Node.js?
[10:38] benvie: worked on various things but currently working on the somewhat incomplete implementation of isolates in the node isolate branch and trying to rectify the chromium content shell againdt it

[10:38] elliottcable: creationix: around?
[10:39] elliottcable: creationix: I ran into this comment on what *looks* like it may be an old version of one of your libraries (node-leveldb).
[10:39] benvie: having compiled both chromium and node against a shared V8 library it actually becomes possible
[10:39] benvie: to load the content shell as a module
[10:39] benvie: but there's a lot more to it
[10:39] elliottcable: creationix: pinging you in hopes that you wrote it originally, and have some experience with this problem
[10:39] elliottcable: creationix: “If you forget to instantiate a static member in the .cc file, node aborts with an "Unable to load shared library" error.”

[11:11] elliottcable: andersonjuhasc: A tutorial to understand *what* better?
[11:11] zomg: I'm not sure if it's the terminal itself but rather the color Irssi uses for it
[11:12] zomg: Other apps use blues which work ok
[11:12] andersonjuhasc: elliottcable: better understand the irc
[11:12] elliottcable: zomg: er, irssi uses the same color as anything else in the terminal ...

[11:15] elliottcable: zomg: well, your terminal has a set of 8 (or possibly 16, long story) colour codes that can be set by various things in the terminal
[11:15] heatxsink: hi where would i find documentation on the res variable that gets passed into app.get?

[11:16] elliottcable: the exact shade / etc is defined by your terminal, not irssi, or anything else that uses them (=
[11:16] elliottcable: most terminals will let you customize them (see my Solarized link! :D)
[11:17] mmalecki: solarized <3
[11:17] elliottcable: some terminals will provide access to the further 16 colours by “brightening” emboldended colours, such as:

[11:21] heatxsink: russfrank: can I use express to hang a response?
[11:21] zomg: Using putty myself, perhaps I'll give that solarized thing a shot

[11:32] elliottcable: booyaa: just make sure you keep your schenanigans to a single channel, and the worst that will happen is you'll get flood-killed, which doesn't prevent you immediately reconnecting.
[11:33] booyaa: elliottcable: will do, cheers.
[11:33] elliottcable: booyaa: the only time auto-kline kicks into effect is if Freenode's heuristics see activity they dislike *across multiple channels simultaneously*

[14:04] zomg: Although some of the points he makes are probably correct. If you really wanted to calculate a fibonacci sequence in node you would probably need to fork it or something

[14:08] passionke has joined the channel
[14:08] Glenjamin: but regardless of the event loop, node (v8) is probably the fastest interpreted language
[14:08] jetienne: yep non blocking isnt too good when your http request which need 5sec of pure cpu
[14:09] zomg: I always have a hard time imagining JS being fast
[14:09] zomg: I'm so used to it not being fast from older days of browser development
[14:09] jetienne: on the other hand, i have hard time finding a case where a http request requires 5sec of pure cpu
[14:09] lazyshot has joined the channel
[14:09] zomg: Every time I see a canvas demo which is nice and not choppy I'm like whoaa
[14:09] zomg: because when I worked with canvas, it was horribly slow
[14:10] zomg: =)
[14:10] Glenjamin: in fact, if you consider the JVM to be compiled, v8 is the fastest interpreted langauge
[14:10] Glenjamin: zomg: the DOM is slow, JS isnt
[14:10] zomg: Well JS itself was slow too
[14:10] zomg: I recall in Firefox for example there was a massive performance penalty from calling functions
[14:10] zomg: Gained huge boosts in performance intensive code by inlining function calls
[14:11] Glenjamin: yeah, thats before JITs
[14:12] zomg: Well considering my basic grade VPS is giving me almost 300 req/s for my non-optimized first-attempt node app it's pretty good

[15:27] tuhoojabotti: sorry for offtopic
[15:28] einaros: djMax: I'm not that familiar with the old drafts. I've written the new hybi drafts for socket.io. the error you're seeing can be from malformed communication by that ws library, or missing handshaking steps on your part
[15:29] djMax: fun.
[15:29] einaros: using socket.io from a plain websocket client does require some insight into the protocol socket.io puts on top of whatever transport your going for
[15:30] salva has joined the channel
[15:30] einaros: if you're not willing to put that work into it, and there are no other client libraries for your particular platform, I'd go with a plain old websocket server
[15:30] djMax: I've written plenty of protocols, so if it's just working through that, happy to give it a go. But not sure how complex it is.

[17:33] jmar777: with url mounting, once you've "matched" the leading portion of the url, it is removed so that nested routing middleware only needs to match on the remainder
[17:33] CiRlE has joined the channel
[17:33] andi__: jmar777: Yes, it seems, but what is the use, because it manipulates node's API
[17:33] jmar777: andi__: i.e., if you mount as '/blog', then nested routing middleware only needs to match against '/posts', '/comments', etc.
[17:34] adambeynon has joined the channel
[17:34] lyte has joined the channel
[17:35] jmar777: andi__: ya, it is a little dubious in that sense. i guess connect's position is that once you've handed the request to it, you're now in "connect land" and it's API takes over where the request is concerned
[17:35] andi__: Hmm, it would make more sense not to change url but add another value 
[17:36] aconbere has joined the channel
[17:36] jmar777: andi__: i think it could be argued both ways. in the layered network sense, middleware should be agnostic of other middleware, so it's kind of "legit" to mask the url when passing it on. but that can definitely be unexpected
[17:37] jmar777: andi__: i think if you just stick with req.originalUrl, you should probably be safe though when interacting with API's "outside of connect"

[18:51] murvin: ok.

[18:51] WarheadsSE: anyone else use nodejs on any ARM linuxes?

[18:53] hunterloftis: cool that's useful, I'll be lurking in there
[18:53] murvin: So, in replica Set, when I establish the connection, I don't need to list out all the hosts, just one, right?    the driver should be able to find out all the hosts and connect to the avaliable ones in failover, right?
[18:53] CiRlE has joined the channel
[18:54] murvin: ekryski: yes.. it is kinda dead.. lol.   yesterday i went there, only 1 person.

[18:55] ekryski: murvin: should be able to.  Haven't moved to full replica set yet. That'll be happening next week but I'm pretty sure you only need your one connection.
[18:56] murvin: i think so too...  because my coworker using PHP driver and it behaves different.. he has to define ALL hosts, otherwise failover cannot connect to secondary.
[18:56] joshsmith: creationix: are you at c9?
[18:56] murvin: that's scary
[18:56] creationix: joshsmith: yeah

[20:43] eldios: which don't happen when you read a novel
[20:44] eldios: and in that "linear" case the Kindle is perfect..
[20:44] aconbere has joined the channel
[20:44] WarheadsSE: if the form factor is a concern, then it is as simple as getting your hands on one @ display, and try it.
[20:44] eldios: mm.. yes.. I'm trhinking on going to a market nearby and try one
[20:44] r1ngzer0: eldios: I bought the Kindle DX thinking it would be usable for technical docs.
[20:45] eldios: r1ngzer0, while it's no?
[20:45] eldios: not*
[20:45] r1ngzer0: I do not use it for tech books pretty much ever.
[20:45] eldios: mm
[20:45] r1ngzer0: can't flip around in it easily.
[20:45] r1ngzer0: which killed it for me.
[20:45] ovaillancourt: amen to what r1ngzer0 is saying, same here
[20:45] WarheadsSE: the DX is also an e-ink screen, without touch
[20:45] eldios: exactly what I fear
[20:45] eldios: yeah I would get the Kindle 4 (basic)

[21:34] akujin- has joined the channel
[21:34] jondot: hi guys. I'm working with connect for production apps. so far,i've deployed around 6 differnt apps, and i see that i always need 3 things: config (dev, prod, test), logging (configurable levels, async), loadbalancing (cluster). before embarking on writing such a library, anyone thinks i'm reinventing the wheel?
[21:35] shanebo: chilts, the purpose of documentation is to know what's expected without trying it
[21:35] djMax: I love betas! Thanks.
[21:35] tjholowaychuk: jondot express?
[21:35] tjholowaychuk: minus the load balancing part
[21:35] tjholowaychuk: but that's not hard to plug in to any app
[21:35] WarheadsSE: djMax, use this ? https://chunkbot.chunkhost.com/referral_codes/129
[21:36] chilts: shanebo: if you have a patch for the docs, I'm sure it'll be more than welcome :)
[21:36] WarheadsSE: oops, meant: http://chunkhost.com/r/chunky
[21:36] jondot: tjholowaychuk: i cannot use applicative logging with express. in my logic code, i can't just call 'log'. there is also no file-configuration with express that i've seen (yamls). neither there is cluster.
[21:36] chilts: shanebo: and also, docs are useless if they aren't read properly
[21:36] tjholowaychuk: jondot well that's because those are all opinionated things
[21:36] tjholowaychuk: yaml config
[21:36] tjholowaychuk: json config
[21:36] tjholowaychuk: redis config
[21:37] tjholowaychuk: js config
[21:37] shanebo: chilts and so is answering a question when you didn't understand the question
[21:37] chilts: lol
[21:37] tjholowaychuk: none of which are perfect, so it's usually better to just combine what you want
[21:37] jondot: tjholowaychuk: well, it doesn't matter what format, as long as the configuration lives outside of the app, and is hierarchical with at least dev, test, and prod levels...?
[21:38] tjholowaychuk: var conf = require('./config/' + app.settings.env)

[21:39] tjholowaychuk: there's no real "right" answer for most of these things

[21:40] Sorella has joined the channel
[21:40] jondot: well, with that i'd like to have some sort of template app. i'd like to just write my express/sinatra routes and be done with it.
[21:40] jondot: i was thinking of providing other developers a convenient method. lets say:  make_awesome( func(log, config){ ... })
[21:40] tjholowaychuk: i just have a template sitting around
[21:40] tjholowaychuk: cp -fr __tmpl myapp
[21:40] jondot: which will take your code, wrap it in a func, and cluster over it
[21:41] jondot: i don't know if this is idiomatic node.js though.
[21:42] shanebo: chilts, hahaha, you're seriously maintaining that good docs wouldn't put the returned type along with the method itself? But rather I should find that out in the examples?
[21:43] chilts: shanebo: that's not at all what I said, but anyway, you asked a question, I helped, and helped some more and then found your answer ... so I guess I must have done something wrong
[21:43] jondot: tjholowaychuk: so what do you think about the latter example? do I have a tiny wheel to invent, or no wheel?
[21:43] chilts: sorry about that
[21:43] chilts: my bad (obviously)

[23:03] prudhvi: Hi, i am using nodejs with mongoose ODM. I was wondering how i could create self referential schemas?. Like say Build { previous: Build } etc.
[23:03] insin: creationix: does nvm have to install the versions of node you want to use, or will it still work if you do it over the top of an existing node install?
[23:04] insin: just about to try caolanm's Kanso 0.1.0 (congrats!) and saw the node about using 0.4.*
[23:04] creationix: insin: it builds each node version with a unique PREFIX
[23:04] creationix: you can have as many as you want installed concurrently
[23:04] augustl: just installed npm on OS X with the .pkg. I installed a package with the -g flag. I can't require it with also npm linking it. Is that the way it's supposed to behave?
[23:04] creationix: and nvm use only affects the current shell environment (different terminal tabs can be using different versions of node)
[23:04] caolanm: insin: you *can* use it with node 0.6.x, but sometimes it won't exit after a command and you have to Ctrl-C it

[23:05] caolanm: insin: and if it asks for a password twice you're screwed ;)
[23:05] insin: !
[23:05] edwardw: I use a newly install node 0.6.5
[23:05] caolanm: insin: this is the bug: https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/2257
[23:06] caolanm: insin: by screwed I mean the terminal might be unusable and you need to open a new one
[23:06] caolanm: insin: just don't type your password in wrong ;)

[23:27] tjholowaychuk: josh9 yeah definitely use node core first
[23:27] tjholowaychuk: get a feel for things
[23:28] josh9: tjholowaychuk: ok. and after i am done with it, try express?
[23:28] tjholowaychuk: if you want to. use node first will give you a better perspective on what provides what
[23:29] josh9: tjholowaychuk: ok. i'll give it a try. i found this as well - http://shapeshed.com/creating-a-basic-site-with-node-and-express/  but it's using express.
[23:29] josh9: so maybe i'll save it for later.

[23:41] isaacs: edwardw: indeed
[23:41] edwardw: ...weird

[23:42] illumina: Do people use Mongoose?
[23:42] isaacs: edwardw: them check out 0.6.5, do ./configure && make && sudo make install
[23:42] isaacs: edwardw: there are probably conflicting build artifacts somewhere.
[23:42] edwardw: isaacs: I just did that. same error
[23:43] edwardw: isaacs: I gonna try v0.6.4
[23:43] isaacs: lzskiss: can you paste the error output to gist or pastie or something

[23:48] isaacs: slide is basically 2 functions
[23:48] isaacs: one to do a bunch of things in parallel, another to do a bunch of things in a series.  it is very small.
