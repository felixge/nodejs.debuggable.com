[00:02] Intel_iX: I'd assume it's simple but I didn't see one on the modules page
[00:03] cl0udy has joined the channel
[00:05] qbert_: jonaslund, same - I dont think it matters much on linux though, youre probably going to 99% windows users
[00:05] qbert_: jonaslund, I wouldnt spend a lot of time on it :S
[00:06] tmzt_: Intel_iX: a what?
[00:06] opus_ has joined the channel
[00:06] tmzt_: xerox: you're queries are supposed to hang
[00:06] opus_: hello everyone
[00:07] tmzt_: or you don't have a connection, mongoose will hang and wait for one
[00:07] opus_: I want to write a node js web service that runs a command, and streams the output (which is continious) to a browser. I think Node.JS would be best for this
[00:07] opus_: curious, how would I learn how to do this?
[00:08] tmzt_: start writing and ask when you get stuck
[00:08] tmzt_: security an sanitization are going to be your biggest concerns
[00:08] thriple: when you know the question, you will know your answer :)
[00:08] tmzt_: if you can, make it a a c++ model isntead
[00:08] tmzt_: module
[00:08] xerox: tmzt_: and when I am done, what do I do?
[00:08] tmzt_: run it
[00:08] tmzt_: use it
[00:08] xerox: I mean it is connected
[00:08] opus_: well, I tried writing a small node.js command line, but it can't contionusly print the output. It appears it waits until the commands done before printing anything. 
[00:08] xerox: the open event is fired
[00:09] xerox: I am doing the .find inside the callback of the connection.on('open', ...)
[00:09] opus_: via the require('child_process').exec function, and passing a "puts" as the second argument (with function puts(er,stdo,err) {sys.puts(stdout))}
[00:09] jonaslund: qbert_: both of the files got a floating point exception ?
[00:10] opus_: do I need to run it as a childprocess?
[00:10] tmzt_: not sure puts is needed, can't you get a stream and pipe that to the browser
[00:10] DavidElias has joined the channel
[00:10] tmzt_: if you don't nee3d to handle stdin input it should be easier
[00:10] opus_: nope, no stdin
[00:10] jonaslund: qbert_: how about http://www.jlim.se/testni.chm then ?
[00:11] Swizec has joined the channel
[00:11] xerox: tmzt_: I tried using .connect instead of .createConnection and it works
[00:12] xerox: I'll stick with the first way from now on
[00:12] opus_: well, the problem is puts doesn't stream output; in fact it doesn't display anything. "ls -la" works, but for example "cat /dev/zero" doesn't
[00:13] opus_: is there a way to send each line as the child_process dumps it into stdout?
[00:15] DTrejo: opus_: yes
[00:15] DTrejo: looking it up
[00:15] DTrejo: opus_: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.10/api/all.html#child_process.spawn

[00:21] opus_: any pointers to where I can now start to stream this to a web browser?
[00:22] opus_: websockets?
[00:22] tmzt: you might need to wrap it in another structure (and closures)
[00:22] tmzt: that's an otpion, but probably overkill
[00:22] opus_: man, I am such a newbie
[00:22] tmzt: what kind of application are you running'
[00:22] Darrow_ has joined the channel
[00:22] opus_: Just a monitoring program
[00:22] tmzt: what does it output and how  often
[00:22] opus_: it outputs about 1 line ever second
[00:22] opus_: every second
[00:22] tmzt: ws could be good, do you have control over the browser that's used?
[00:23] opus_: Yes, just chrome
[00:23] jameson: does anyone know if async.forEach will never return if you never do the callback?
[00:23] tmzt: you could also try socket.io or even easier, dnode
[00:23] opus_: and probably firefox
[00:23] Darrow_: Not exactly a node question, but how do you use node-tap to compare array output?
[00:23] opus_: ok
[00:23] opus_: thanks
[00:23] MGT has joined the channel
[00:23] Darrow_: It seems to only compare the object itself, but I need it to compare the values in my arrays.
[00:24] opus_: Nice, dnode

[01:36] Nexxy: good on ya
[01:36] blueadept: ha
[01:36] sorensen: convert JS to CS so it can convert to JS...
[01:36] sorensen: ~.^
[01:36] Nexxy: blueadept, are you sure you weren't looking for #RoR?
[01:37] Nuck: sorensen: Silly, isn't it?
[01:37] sorensen: a little
[01:37] chrisdickinson: ACTION sighs.
[01:37] sorensen: strange if nothing else
[01:38] chrisdickinson: next time i look into this room, I won't be surprised if Nuck has taken to hitting coffeescript users with bars of soap in socks.
[01:38] Nexxy: I think the word you're looking for is, "retarded"
[01:38] sorensen: well, i think that is stepping some boundaries
[01:38] Stythys has joined the channel
[01:38] sorensen: not that i have anything against calling things retarded
[01:38] Nexxy: cs -> js -> cs
[01:39] Nuck: chrisdickinson: Soap?  Socks?  No, I use burlap sacks with bricks.
[01:39] Nexxy: yes, that's retarded
[01:39] chjj: nuck, no, use a lock in a sock
[01:39] chrisdickinson: I mean, I appreciate that you don't like CS; that's fine. I don't like ruby, but I don't actively antagonize ruby users.
[01:39] sorensen: id rather not this chan be filled with flaming or insults
[01:39] sorensen: save it for ##javascript
[01:39] chrisdickinson: sorensen: same here.

[01:40] sorensen: lol
[01:40] Nexxy: halp! I'm being antagonized over my desire to do stupid things with javascript!
[01:40] Nexxy: please save me from the chore of actually having to learn the language I want to charge people to write for them!
[01:40] sorensen: flaming someone will make them less likely to ask for help in the future
[01:40] chjj: next april fools, ryan should rewrite all of core in coffeescript
[01:41] sorensen: unless that is your intent
[01:41] sorensen: chjj: that would be funny as all hell
[01:41] Nuck: chjj: YES YES YES YES
[01:41] chrisdickinson: Nexxy: not really always the case; I use (and love!) js, but I like CS a lot too.
[01:41] Nuck: I WOULD GIGGLESHIT
[01:41] blueadept: agreed
[01:42] Nexxy: chrisdickinson, I don't begrudge you for that! but srsly, converting js to cs??
[01:42] Nuck: CS has some good things
[01:42] Nuck: But the majority are bad
[01:42] sorensen: Nexxy: yes, its obviously not the best of ideas, but... stay classy about it yeah?

[01:43] Nuck: CS has shitty syntax by nature
[01:43] TooTallNate has joined the channel
[01:43] Nuck: And classes vs. prototypes don't affect me, I stick to closures more :P
[01:43] mrryanjohnston has joined the channel
[01:43] Nuck: I abuse closures like a priest absuing a choir boy.
[01:43] chjj: nuck: it doesnt really make much sense to "pick" one over the other
[01:43] sorensen: lol!
[01:43] chjj: they each have their uses
[01:44] michaelhartau has joined the channel
[01:44] sorensen: that needs to go on a quote board somewhere
[01:44] Nuck: I use the modular structure of closures
[01:44] Nexxy: and somehow I'm the one that should "stay classy"
[01:44] Nexxy: let's use analogies of sexual abuse!
[01:44] Nexxy: that's acceptable.
[01:44] sorensen: yes, because your comment was directed towards a fellow programmer
[01:44] chjj: closures are also not the equivalent of prototypes either
[01:45] Nexxy: sorensen, I invite you to re-read my comments
[01:45] chjj: you can do inheritence properly for example
[01:45] chjj: you cant just choose to use closures for everything, at some point youre going to have to use prototypes
[01:45] sorensen: i'm just thinking of the guy who asked the question Nexxy, i'm sure he didnt feel too good about the response
[01:45] sorensen: it wasnt about him being wrong, its just the approach taken to tell him so
[01:46] chjj: i didnt feel to good about his question
[01:46] chjj: were even
[01:46] sorensen: ACTION implying he was wrong not knowing the use case

[01:48] chjj: knowing that people are standing up against that shit
[01:48] chjj: rofl
[01:48] sorensen: Nexxy: it was just implying that the person asking the question was retarded for doing it
[01:48] chrisdickinson: Nexxy: fair enough. I was talking about the comments in general.
[01:48] Nexxy: pretty sure talking about cs/js is way more on-topic than abusing choir boys and making ignorant comments toward asians

[01:52] Nexxy: considering there are at least a few heavy contributors that use cs

[01:57] chrisdickinson: Nexxy: and I agree with you, if someone is doing something silly, it's totally okay to show them why it's silly. but being friendly and helpful about it will make the lesson more likely to stick, and the community will be a lil' bit stronger for it.
[01:57] tbranyen: i'm not hipster enough to hate on java

[06:11] jesusabdullah: fhqwhclass
[06:11] chjj: have one file require all files you want, and then require that single file, youll have them on one object
[06:11] chjj: i mean, put them on one object in that one file
[06:12] shanebo: chjj, well I just feel like I'm repeating myself a lot in node… but admittedly it's my shortcoming
[06:12] jesusabdullah: Write a module that aggregates other modules
[06:12] jesusabdullah: oh, wait, globals? HISSSSSS
[06:12] jesusabdullah: That's what I hate about client side

[06:13] shanebo: jesusabdullah, it's great if you write good encapsulated code though

[06:15] mnaser: jeeezozz
[06:15] shanebo: jesusabdullah you've never seen a clean mootools project then :)
[06:15] chjj: in one file you could do: `module.exports = { one: require('./one'), two: require('./two') };
[06:15] SubStack: mkrecny: I've even got a cenetering example all up in the readme
[06:15] chjj: etc
[06:15] SubStack: should hopefully do what you need
[06:15] SubStack: word wrapping is hard >_<
[06:15] chjj: substack is pro
[06:15] konobi: var foo = require('thing'); foo.bar(); foo.baz(); foo.bleh();
[06:16] mkrecny: yeah i'm actually rendering the output of a cellular automata to stdout
[06:16] SubStack: *centering
[06:16] SubStack: neat
[06:16] mkrecny: yeah it's fun
[06:16] shanebo: now in app.js will I need to parse that out into vars or those objects are auto accessible once they return?
[06:17] jesusabdullah: I also dislike the idea of these monolithic client side frameworks
[06:17] jesusabdullah: such as mootools
[06:17] jesusabdullah: blegh
[06:17] jesusabdullah: but I suspect that what you end up is an ad hoc module system anyway.
[06:17] jesusabdullah: but, y'know, like I have any idea
[06:17] shanebo: and don't get me started on jQuery :D
[06:17] jesusabdullah: also I'm grumpy right now
[06:17] chjj: shanebo: sorry, what?
[06:17] chjj: jquery is full of fail, we all know this
[06:18] jesusabdullah: jquery is just all like, "fuck all of you"
[06:18] jesusabdullah: and you're like, "fiiiine"D
[06:18] SubStack: jquery is relatively sane I think
[06:18] jesusabdullah: "I'll program in jquery and not javascript"
[06:18] jesusabdullah: "geez"
[06:18] SubStack: it does dom well and doesn't try to do too much other stuff
[06:18] chjj: jquery is just like "hey i got an idea ill put EVERYTHING onto a single constructors prototype"
[06:18] svenlito has joined the channel
[06:18] jesusabdullah: It *does* do dom well
[06:18] chjj: E V E R Y T H I N G
[06:18] jesusabdullah: I find it useful
[06:18] shanebo: hahaha
[06:19] jesusabdullah: idk if I think it's all great and dandy but it's definitely useful
[06:19] chjj: E -=- V -=- E -=- R -=- Y -=- T -=- H -=- I -=- N -=- G
[06:19] shanebo: HAHAHAHAHA
[06:19] konobi: i'm sorry bob, did you just tell me to go fuck myself?
[06:20] shanebo: chjj, re: the require, I'm asking if I'll still need to require that in all files I recursively require in order to have access to those objects
[06:20] dguttman has joined the channel
[06:21] konobi: shanebo: yes
[06:21] shanebo: boooo
[06:21] shanebo: ;)
[06:21] konobi: there's context seperation there for a reason =0)
[06:21] konobi: shanebo: avoids libraries you require from stomping all over your code
[06:21] konobi: =0)
[06:22] shanebo: konobi, yeah admittedly my ignorance is in not understanding the implications of a single threaded event IO
[06:22] rhdoenges: konobi: I believe I did, ed
[06:22] shanebo: O_o
[06:22] jesusabdullah: shanebo: Use them as closures :)
[06:22] rhdoenges: :D
[06:22] shanebo: I've been told node.js would just click one day, after weeks of headaches
[06:23] jesusabdullah: It probably will
[06:23] jesusabdullah: It's a fun time!
[06:23] dexter_e has joined the channel
[06:23] rhdoenges: it is indeed
[06:24] chjj: it could be more gradual than abrupt if thats anymore encouraging
[06:24] SubStack: shanebo: but you've done browser javascript
[06:24] shanebo: SubStack, yes a lot of it
[06:24] jesusabdullah: It really should feel pretty natural aside from the require, then
[06:24] chjj: shanebo: you have to understand something, theres a major problem with the browser: its not node
[06:24] SubStack: node is just v8 with some wrappers for disk and network i/o
[06:24] shanebo: I got a simple VC (no M) written in node in the last couple hours not using express
[06:24] SubStack: using the standard async browser programming model
[06:24] shanebo: so I'm trying to get a feel for the internals
[06:25] Throlkim has joined the channel
[06:25] SubStack: I don't think MVC is a useful way of decomposing problems
[06:25] rhdoenges: the way I coached myself was to keep repeating in my head "return is evil. return is evil. return is evil."
[06:25] konobi: shanebo: just read them... most of it is in javascript
[06:25] rhdoenges: I mean, return is nice
[06:25] shanebo: jesusabdullah, yep, require is the only thing giving me hangups
[06:25] rhdoenges: but I had to figure out callbacks.
[06:25] rhdoenges: require is kinda funky
[06:25] SubStack: require is super straight-forward
[06:25] SubStack: qualified imports by default
[06:25] chjj: i love nodes module system, im so glad its synchronous too
[06:26] jesusabdullah: Yeah, require rocks my socks
[06:26] chjj: if you really want to understand it more, i recommend reading lib/module.js
[06:26] chjj: gives you a good picture of what happens behind the scenes
[06:26] SubStack: when I get some more time I'll impelement that async field for browserify >:D
[06:26] shanebo: yeah I learned quickly that returns are nice only in certain methods :D
[06:27] chjj: haha
[06:27] SubStack: to transform the requires with burrito to load projects piece-wise asynchronously
[06:27] jesusabdullah: SubStack: That'll shut them up!
[06:27] SubStack: not because I personally need that for anything but more that I keep hearing that the silly async require programming model is the only way to do big projects
[06:27] SubStack: jesusabdullah: indeed it will!
[06:28] chjj: i hope amd dies out in the browser, its really not necessary
[06:28] dguttman has joined the channel
[06:28] rhdoenges: it is a matter of personal preference
[06:28] KenStewart: quick question
[06:29] KenStewart: the node modules folder
[06:29] KenStewart: goes where in the node folder
[06:29] shanebo: so guys I hear mongoose is what I want to use for ORM/Models?
[06:29] konobi: the browser isn't hitting local disk... it's a different problem space where AMD makes more sense
[06:30] chjj: i realize that
[06:30] chjj: but its not necessary
[06:30] chjj: youre making more http requests for no reason, when you could just concatenate js files
[06:30] konobi: assuming they're all coming from the same place
[06:31] chjj: and?
[06:31] chjj: oh sorry misread you
[06:32] chjj: i wouldnt want to work on any project where i had such little control
[06:33] chjj: i think its one area google closure was kind of onto something, they just didnt execute it very well
[06:33] andree has joined the channel
[06:33] mscdex: KenStewart: it's relative to your project folder: ./node_modules
[06:33] KenStewart: ah
[06:33] KenStewart: i see
[06:34] tayy has joined the channel
[06:35] chjj: kensteward, when you require something the ancestral directory structure is traversed, looking for node_modules
[06:35] chjj: kenstewart* even
[06:35] ivanfi has joined the channel
[06:35] KenStewart: right
[06:35] KenStewart: but
[06:35] chjj: it checks the current directory first though
[06:35] KenStewart: i'm rpm-ing 
[06:35] KenStewart: and i get
[06:36] KenStewart: node.js:134
[06:36] KenStewart:         throw e; // process.nextTick error, or 'error' event on first tick
[06:36] KenStewart:         ^
[06:36] KenStewart: Error: Cannot find module 'socket.io'
[06:36] mnaser: KenStewart: meet pastebin.com
[06:36] KenStewart: sorry
[06:36] SubStack: konobi: what I was getting at there is that AMD could be supported with the synchronous-looking require() syntax and some static analysis with burrito
[06:36] KenStewart: i'm trying to get rpm to install socket.io correctly
[06:37] konobi: npm?
[06:37] KenStewart: where i am when i yeah
[06:37] tayy has joined the channel
[06:37] KenStewart: sorry
[06:37] KenStewart: *npm
[06:37] chjj: npm installs things locally by default
[06:37] KenStewart: right
[06:37] davidcoallier has joined the channel
[06:37] KenStewart: so where should i be when i call npm install socket.io
[06:37] chjj: you can either do npm install [name] -g or install in your node_modules dir
[06:38] chjj: in any node_modules directory in your modules ancestral directory structure
[06:38] chjj: or in its current directory
[06:38] joshonth_ has joined the channel
[06:39] chjj: so if you wanted a "global" node_modules dir, make a node_modules dir in your home directory
[06:39] chjj: and every one of your modules within your home dir could see it
[06:39] KenStewart: ok
[06:39] KenStewart: i'll try that
[06:39] chjj: somewhere within your home dir

[06:40] KenStewart: ok
[06:41] KenStewart: i did but it's still hitting the Error: Cannot find module 'socket.io'
[06:41] chjj: ok, where did you install socket.io, where is your module, and what did you execute for require
[06:41] chjj: need to know those 3 things before i can help
[06:42] KenStewart: ok
[06:42] KenStewart: 1: i have socket.io installed in ~ dir
[06:42] igl: did you use install -g?
[06:42] KenStewart: like you said
[06:43] igl: dont forget the NODE_PATH
[06:43] chjj: no
[06:43] chjj: ken
[06:43] chjj: make a node_modules dir in your home dir
[06:43] KenStewart: sorry, 
[06:43] chjj: and put it there

[06:44] KenStewart: "/Users/kennethdstewart/node_modules"
[06:44] chjj: ok, good
[06:44] chjj: now inside that should be socket.io
[06:45] chjj: ~/node_modules/socket.io/
[06:45] KenStewart: yes
[06:45] chjj: the directory contains a package.json or an index right?
[06:45] dguttman has joined the channel
[06:45] KenStewart: yes
[06:45] chjj: just to make sure something didnt go wrong
[06:45] chjj: ok
[06:45] KenStewart: and other stuff
[06:45] chjj: now what is the path of your module?
[06:46] KenStewart: what do you mean by module?
[06:46] KenStewart: node?
[06:46] chjj: your file you want to execute with node
[06:46] KenStewart: ah
[06:46] KenStewart: it's in the Downloads folder
[06:46] chjj: in your home directory?
[06:46] chjj: ~/Downloads?
[06:46] KenStewart: yea
[06:47] groom has joined the channel
[06:47] chjj: ok, now what does your require call look like?
[06:47] KenStewart: i'm using this to test
[06:47] KenStewart: http://davidwalsh.name/websocket
[06:47] KenStewart: it's the zip there
[06:48] KenStewart: the line is
[06:48] KenStewart: var http = require('http'), io = require('socket.io');
[06:48] KenStewart: should the socket.io be a path
[06:48] KenStewart: ?
[06:48] chjj: no
[06:48] chjj: that should be good
[06:48] KenStewart: ok
[06:48] hij1nx has joined the channel
[06:48] KenStewart: well, when i run the code
[06:48] chjj: try creating just a vanilla module with nothing in it that requires socket.io
[06:48] KenStewart: i get:   info  - socket.io started
[06:49] KenStewart: ok
[06:49] chjj: ok, well that means its good
[06:49] chjj: i dont understand, you get an error after?
[06:49] KenStewart: no
[06:49] KenStewart: i was
[06:49] chjj: just try doing nothing else but requiring socket.io, see if that module youre using is funky
[06:49] chjj: oh, now it works?
[06:49] KenStewart: until i installed it in the home dir
[06:49] chjj: so what is the problem now?
[06:50] herbySk has joined the channel
[06:50] KenStewart: the console.log() is not posting
[06:51] KenStewart: it just oscillates between info....
[06:51] KenStewart: and    warn  - unknown transport: "undefined"
[06:51] templaedhel has joined the channel
[06:51] chjj: that module youre using might depend on an older version of socket.io or something
[06:51] templaedhel: Evening
[06:51] KenStewart: then   info  - unhandled socket.io url
[06:51] KenStewart: ah
[06:51] KenStewart: ok
[06:51] KenStewart: well
[06:52] KenStewart: i'll keep plugging
[06:52] KenStewart: at least i'm getting something now other than unknown module"

[06:56] mscdex has joined the channel
[06:57] shanebo: do you guys only run logger in dev?
[06:57] fraserkillip: you load the client in socket.io 0.7.x with server:port/socket.io/socket.io.js  or just /socket.io/socket.io.js if the socket.io server is on the same server and port as your webserver

[07:00] Nuck: Going from AS3 to JS
[07:00] inimino: AS3 is not ECMAScript.
[07:01] rhdoenges: it's a dialect, just like js
[07:01] Nuck: Aye, it technically is.  It's a heavily-modded variant, but at the core, it is still ECMAscript
[07:01] Nuck: Look it up,
[07:01] inimino: I actually know the history, Nuck.
[07:01] chjj: js is the unnoficiall name for ecmascript
[07:01] chjj: wow i butchered that word
[07:01] Nuck: nevermind anyways, I got him nodebeginner :P
[07:01] chjj: unofficial
[07:02] chjj: ecmascript is js, its not simply a dialect
[07:02] tuhoojabotti: js<3
[07:02] Nuck: JavaScript is an implementation of the ECMAScript standard
[07:02] Nuck: It is far closer to said standard than AS3
[07:02] Nuck: But they are technically both built on the same standard.
[07:02] TomY_ has joined the channel
[07:03] chjj: its not an implementation, javascript was the name for ES before it became standardized
[07:03] tuhoojabotti: ES xxxD
[07:03] Nuck: well yeah
[07:03] pyro1: technically the same standard?
[07:03] pyro1: i dont know if there was much technique about it lol
[07:03] Nuck: But the standard is now ECMAScript
[07:03] KenStewart: thanks for your help
[07:03] KenStewart: bye
[07:03] chjj: its not a "dialect", read the spec
[07:03] Nuck: And JS implementations are now from that
[07:04] thalll has joined the channel
[07:04] chjj: javascript is essentially just the informal name for ecmascript, look at any js engine, they will say they implement ecmascript
[07:05] kartmetal: mostly. when mozilla says javascript, it sometimes means quite a bit more than ecmascript.
[07:05] liar has joined the channel
[07:05] chjj: yeah, good thing theyre not everyone
[07:06] kartmetal: also, AS3 compilers have an "ecmascript" flag, that compiles things into something that obeys the usual prototype-based object model.
[07:06] kartmetal: I suspect nobody's ever use that flag, but it's there.

[07:09] rhdoenges: I don't vandalize pages
[07:09] rhdoenges: I just said I was tempted to
[07:09] chjj: shanebo: yes, if you want to send a content-type, which you do
[07:10] chjj: shanebo: but you can just res.setHeader() and it will implicitly send the headers when you call .end
[07:10] chjj: in fact technically not even .writeHead sends the headers
[07:10] rhdoenges: I wish there was `git blame` for wikipedia
[07:10] chjj: it renders them and they sit there until the first write call
[07:10] Nuck: rhdoenges: History tab?

[07:45] loob2 has joined the channel
[07:46] thepatr1ck: it's in the socket.io-client submodule in it's bin/{rebuild? build?} something directory. 
[07:47] Druide_ has joined the channel
[07:47] thepatr1ck: as to the solution... for me it was to just add a return immediately above the require of uglify-js (I don't let socket.io serve its client js, that's delivered through the CDN)
[07:47] AAA_awright: There's no submodules
[07:47] AAA_awright: Not in master, at least
[07:47] thepatr1ck: maybe in node_modules ?
[07:47] AAA_awright: in 0.6 it worked without any intervention
[07:47] AAA_awright: THere's no node_modules either
[07:47] AAA_awright: find . -name ug\* returns nothing
[07:48] thepatr1ck: we upgraded from 0.6-0.7 recently - but obtained it by npm install'ing socket.io
[07:48] thepatr1ck: (rather than checking it out the git repo)
[07:49] AAA_awright: ... Wht does socket.io want redis?!?
[07:49] AAA_awright: *Why
[07:50] AAA_awright: thepatr1ck: I just need to git clone https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS.git uglify-js I guess
[07:50] thepatr1ck: for some reason the redis client is a dependency
[07:52] thepatr1ck: looking at it's code it can use redis as some kind of store, we're not using that part of it either
[07:52] `3rdEden: AAA_awright uglify is used to minify the client, and Redis will be used for the new storage engine so you can scale over multiple processes
[07:53] `3rdEden: AAA_awright installing socket.io over npm should just install uglifyjs if not, it's a npm bug ;)
[07:53] futuredarrell: is sys.inherits still in use? i've seen it in some tutorials but cant find sys in the docs
[07:53] AAA_awright: Some of don't use npm
[07:54] AAA_awright: Alright git clone https://github.com/mranney/node_redis.git redis seems to fix it all

[09:54] HelloWorld: hello, how to remove all \r\n from any kind of string/array?
[09:54] kingkonga: AAA : start with this i think -- http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.10/api/fs.html#fs.watchFile
[09:55] AAA_awright: v8: "A\rb\nc\rd\n".replace(/[\r\n]/g,"");
[09:55] v8bot_: AAA_awright: "Abcd"
[09:56] AAA_awright: HelloWorld: Like so
[09:56] Nuck: v8bot_: Good work, soldier.
[09:56] Metal3d: excuse me but, is there a way to work with big float ?
[09:56] AAA_awright: All javascript numbers are 64-bit floating points
[09:57] Metal3d: yes, but there is a way to support very big long float
[09:57] Metal3d: ?
[09:57] AAA_awright: Metal3d: For more you're going to have to seralize it into a Buffer or use a big number library
[09:57] Metal3d: big number library, right, this is what I'm seeking :)
[09:58] AAA_awright: Uh, google, I don't have any experience with it within Node.js
[09:58] Metal3d: ok
[09:58] Metal3d: thanks
[09:58] AAA_awright: kingkonga: I've got the fs.watchFile down

[09:59] zilch_ has joined the channel
[09:59] Nuck: AAA_awright: pray for my success on the Y Combinator thingy ;P (doubt I'll actually get in, though I've got a damn good team assembled, the project itself is kinda iffy)
[10:00] kingkonga: AAA_awright : so watchfile would callback on every access, you need to keep track of whats changed ... maybe track size?
[10:00] Nuck: Hey guys, any of you know what a shoddy office in SF costs?
[10:00] Nuck: For like, 5 guys, tops?

[10:01] AAA_awright: Nuck: I think it's a good idea
[10:01] SubStack: Nuck: do you need an office right away?
[10:02] Nuck: SubStack: I wanna move to SF area, whether or not I can get VC from Y Combinator, but I need to know prices of office buildings for an eventual target.

[10:02] SubStack: Nuck: I mean, why do you need to work from a place?
[10:03] SubStack: if you're just starting out with a small team hacking from home works pretty well
[10:03] Nuck: SubStack: Our team relies on me to do the server mostly
[10:03] pNstK has joined the channel

[10:03] Nuck: Then we have our mobile dev
[10:03] Nuck: And a server administrator
[10:04] AAA_awright: Specialization is GREAT but people do need to know that other team members aren't completely BSing them, too
[10:04] Nuck: AAA_awright: I know what everybody is working on right now.
[10:04] Nuck: Pickley, our mobile dev, ahs begun mocking up our mobile app

[10:06] AAA_awright: But other than very basic understanding of who specalizes in what
[10:06] AAA_awright: But what am I saying, you clearly know all this
[10:07] HelloWorld: how to keep sockets alive with socket.io? it seems like websocket is the only stable connection type?
[10:08] HelloWorld: does some kind of ping work to keep the other transport types alive?

[11:12] Drakonite: good to see someone is awake
[11:12] Drakonite: I'm looking at using node.js to implement the web backend for a mobile application
[11:12] Nexxy: yay!
[11:12] Nexxy: Drakonite++
[11:12] v8bot_:  Nexxy has given a beer to Drakonite. Drakonite now has 1 beers.
[11:12] catb0t: Drakonite now has 1 beer
[11:12] Drakonite: I'm trying to find an existing solution for user authentication
[11:13] Nexxy: hmmm!
[11:13] sridatta has joined the channel
[11:13] Nexxy: something like OAuth?
[11:13] Drakonite: the intent is for the client side to handle login transparently, but everything I can find is based on requiring an actual webview being provided to the user and relying on url redirects
[11:13] Nexxy: or fb connect?
[11:13] Nexxy: or your own database?
[11:14] tuhoojabotti: Nexxy, Drakonite: Hai :3
[11:14] Nexxy: my question would be how you get the credentials to the client in the first place if it's completely transparent
[11:14] zilch_ has joined the channel
[11:14] Nexxy: I could see using something like localStorage or something
[11:14] Drakonite: my own database works, though at one point I liked the idea of using openID so I didn't need to deal with user creation and password resets, etc
[11:14] tuhoojabotti: BrowserID!
[11:15] pNstK has joined the channel
[11:15] tuhoojabotti: :D
[11:15] Drakonite: well, I mean, the user would provide user/pass info on install, and the client would auto-login after that
[11:15] tuhoojabotti: Drakonite: Btw, it's 14:15 here and I'm at work. :P
[11:16] Nexxy: it's 4:16 here and I'm @ work!
[11:16] fangel has joined the channel
[11:16] kdng-saleem3: It's 7:16 here and I'm @ work!!! ;)
[11:17] Nexxy: Drakonite, can you just use some sort of auth token that's just sent w/ every request?
[11:17] Nexxy: that would make it easy to be all RESTful and what not
[11:17] tuhoojabotti: Some one explain RESTful in one sentence.
[11:17] tuhoojabotti: :P
[11:18] Nexxy: uh lol
[11:18] Drakonite: if there isn't a solution I will have to implement my own and use something like that to track it.. but the point is I don't want to handle a lot of that stuff if I don't need to
[11:19] tuhoojabotti: I can't be bothered to read a huge article about it, but every one here seems to be talking about it.
[11:19] chjj has joined the channel
[11:19] Nexxy: Drakonite, I'm sure you could find some modules out there that would do most/all of that for you
[11:19] Nexxy: I haven't personally used any node auth libs tho
[11:20] Drakonite: any recommendations?
[11:20] shapeshed has joined the channel
[11:20] Nexxy: tuhoojabotti, basically uhm...
[11:20] tuhoojabotti: :D
[11:20] mape: everyauth?
[11:20] Nexxy: tuhoojabotti, stateless generic HTTP API
[11:20] Nexxy: utilizing existing HTTP methods
[11:20] Nexxy: w/o a bunch of bullshit ontop
[11:20] Drakonite: the only one I've tried that didn't rely on a bunch of url redirects was 'login' .. which just plain didn't work, and had quite a few syntax errors
[11:20] tuhoojabotti: stateless as in?
[11:21] Nexxy: as in; a client isn't required to log-in before being allowed to perform a certain action or make a particular request
[11:21] tuhoojabotti: So it doesn't have like sessions?
[11:21] Nexxy: all credentials necessary to complete any action are sent with every request
[11:21] tomilaine: hi, any opinions on colors.js vs. colours.js vs. coloder.js vs. cli-color vs. ? :)
[11:21] Drakonite: sessions would be stored as data on the client side
[11:21] Nexxy: tuhoojabotti, as far as the user is concerned; they would of course need to log in to your app
[11:21] tuhoojabotti: tomilaine: Just use one? :D
[11:22] tomilaine: :D
[11:22] Nexxy: login was probably the wrong word
[11:22] Nexxy: authenticate?
[11:22] tuhoojabotti: I have colors.js or colours.js, dunno.
[11:22] tuhoojabotti: works :P

[11:23] Nexxy: that explains it better than I can
[11:24] Drakonite: mape: recommendation on where to find docs for that?
[11:24] Nexxy: just that one section is probably enough to understand the basic idea
[11:24] tuhoojabotti: Nexxy: What is I say about hueg articles? :/

[12:52] kkaefer: domachine: afaik you can't fully try/catch module loading :(
[12:52] kkaefer: domachine: the closest way is to fs.stat the file you want to load and see whether it exists
[12:53] domachine: kkaefer: Oh thx for your answer
[12:53] kkaefer: require.resolve('module name') will give you the file
[12:53] zilch_ has joined the channel
[12:53] kkaefer: but there are many edge cases in module loading
[12:53] kkaefer: and I don't think require.resolve() reads package.json
[12:54] kkaefer: domachine: the best way to find out more about module loading is to actually read node's source code
[12:54] domachine: kkaefer: Ok thx. I'll check it.

[12:55] christophsturm: domachine: what modules do you want to load dynamically?
[12:56] domachine: kkaefer: I want a plugin mechanism

[12:56] domachine: I want dynamic plugin. So they don't have to be valid nodejs modules
[12:57] zilch_ has joined the channel
[12:57] kkaefer: domachine: you have to describe that more precisely, "dynamic plugin" doesn't really mean anything
[12:57] domachine: christophsturm: Any idea about how to handle this in node way?
[12:58] c_t has joined the channel
[12:58] domachine: christophsturm: I've done this before but with python and its __import__ function.
[12:58] christophsturm: domachine: i think you should write some example code and maybe a failing testcase. that always helps me to avoid overengineering and overthinking
[12:59] julienXX has joined the channel
[13:00] domachine: christophsturm: Yeah i did this: With require and a try...catch. But the exception is a simple object.
[13:00] kkaefer: you still didn't describe what you want to do exactly
[13:00] kkaefer: and how you expect node to behave
[13:00] kkaefer: and how it actually behaves
[13:01] domachine: kkaefer: Oh sorry.
[13:01] domachine: ok ...
[13:01] HelloWorld: is there anything already made to execute jquery commands from nodejs json?
[13:02] unlink has joined the channel
[13:02] domachine: kkaefer: I want to implement a plugin mechanism: My first draft was to simply ``require()`` the module and simply catch some exception and check its type.
[13:03] domachine: kkaefer: But the problem is that the thrown exception is a simple ``object``. So I can't figure out what error occured while loading.
[13:04] domachine: kkaefer: So I asked myself if there isn't a more elegant way to do this.
[13:04] kkaefer: what do you expect to happen when require()ing a module fails?
[13:04] thomblake has joined the channel
[13:04] thomblake has left the channel
[13:04] domachine: kkaefer: I expect some useful exception to check for with typeof.
[13:05] domachine: kkaefer: So that I can figure out if the module is broken or doesn't exist.
[13:05] kkaefer: domachine: maybe you're confusing typeof with instanceof?
[13:05] kkaefer: typeof new Error() === 'object'
[13:05] kkaefer: err instanceof Error === true
[13:06] domachine: kkaefer: Oh this is interesting. I'm new to javascript maybe I should first learn about these operators
[13:06] kkaefer: typeof returns object for everything, except for numbers, strings, functions and undefined
[13:06] domachine: kkaefer: Ah thank you for this useful information.
[13:06] kkaefer: try{}...catch(err) { console.warn(err); }
[13:06] kkaefer: that'll probably print the error object
[13:07] kkaefer: and you'll see what properties it has etc.
[13:07] kkaefer: as a general advice, checking types in JavaScript isn't a very good idea for most things
[13:07] TechCel has joined the channel
[13:07] kkaefer: instead, you should check whether the object has the required properties for your code to operate
[13:07] domachine: kkaefer: Ah, thank you. I see I should first learn some more basic things about javascript.
[13:07] kkaefer: domachine: this is called "duck typing" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing
[13:08] domachine: kkaefer: Ok this is something I know. I did a lot things with python.

[18:12] isaacs: jhurliman: http://nodeworkup17.eventbrite.com/
[18:12] isaacs: sholden: 0.4.10 is stable.
[18:13] nibblebo_: .4.x is stable
[18:13] nibblebo_: .5.x is unstable
[18:13] isaacs: sholden: but 0.4.9 is not >= 0.4.10
[18:13] isaacs: it's a vector, not a float
[18:13] sholden: ok... im stupid... thanks for the help

[18:14] jetienne has joined the channel
[18:14] brianV: Node.js architecture question - it's a single thread which doesn't lock while waiting for IO... but what happens if a request requires some CPU-intensive processing? Do all requests wait until the single node.js thread deals with the CPU-intensive request?
[18:14] isaacs: sholden: nave sees 0.4.10 as stable, i believ
[18:14] isaacs: sholden: nvm might be doing alpha-sort
[18:15] isaacs: brianV: yes
[18:15] sholden: gotcha.  I'll file a bug on github
[18:15] isaacs: brianV: do processing-heavy stuff in a child process.
[18:15] bradleymeck: brianV use a child process, C++ addon, or IPC
[18:15] brianV: hmmm... ok
[18:15] brianV: thanks
[18:15] isaacs: child_process.fork is kinda nice.
[18:15] isaacs: it's a bit like the webworker api
[18:15] medikoo: sholden: do 'nvm sync'
[18:15] isaacs: cp.send({some: "message});  cp.on("message", function (data) { ..  }
[18:16] isaacs: and then in the child process, do process.on("message", function (data) { ... }) and process.send({some: "message"})
[18:16] brianV: isaacs: ah, interesting
[18:16] brianV: so a separate process running that we can fire stuff to for handling

[18:45] svenlito has joined the channel

[18:46] jbrokc: Draggor: there's tame.js but i'm looking for alternatives

[18:47] blueadept: anyone familiar with https://github.com/didit-tech/FastLegS/ ?
[18:47] jbrokc: tmcw: exactly
[18:47] losing has joined the channel
[18:47] tmcw: Correct me if I'm wrong, gods of node, but on the filesystem, writing a script with blocking calls is similar to writing a script in any other language
[18:48] tmcw: Unless you'd like to do something in parallel, in which case you should use the async versions of the calls
[18:48] Draggor: in my experience that's held true </anecdotal evidence>
[18:48] tmcw: There's no 'other thing' for a shell script to do when it's downloading or writing or whatnot
[18:48] springify has joined the channel
[18:48] malkomalko has joined the channel
[18:48] Draggor: You very easily could write it async as a shell script anyway
[18:48] tmcw: Obviously, on a server or anything with more than one entry point, blocking calls are a very serious no-no.
[18:48] Draggor: even if you're not doing parallel tasks
[18:49] jbrokc: tmcw: it is! which i've just disocvered. i didn't know read/writeFile had sync versions and thought they only had async versions which to me makes no sense for local scripting
[18:49] tmcw: Draggor: sure, the 'callback hell' is not all that bad. Just saying that it's not always necessary if you're doing something simple and don't care about abstracting it into a server component
[18:50] AvianFlu has joined the channel
[18:50] Draggor: tmcw: Oh I completely agree.  Mostly I do so much of node as async, even my little scripts are written that way due to habbit
[18:50] tmcw: Samesies. It's hard to fight habit

[18:51] jakehow has joined the channel
[18:51] jbrokc: Draggor: how do you guys avoid callback hell, in that case?
[18:51] Draggor: Really if you just take the time to think about what you're doing, it doesn't get bad
[18:51] Draggor: If things start looking hairy, you can use less anon functions
[18:52] jbrokc: and, just so i understand the terminology at least somewhat - async calls are executed in line with the async calls below them, as in, none of them are waiting for eachother. yet executing something within the callback of an async functino is the same as executing something after a sync function
[18:52] jbrokc: is that close?
[18:52] tmcw: jbrokc: node-seq is the best library for untangling things that I've run into, but, yes, decomposing anonymous functions is the first big step
[18:53] tmcw: jbrokc: more or less - the arguments to a callback tend to be the result of the sync function, with an 'err' argument in front of it for whatever exception or error the sync version would give you
[18:54] tomtomaso has joined the channel
[18:54] tmcw: Switching from one to the other is mainly a matter of dealing with what to do with errors (since you stop using usual exceptions) and what to do with the 'this' keyword, which will start referring to all kinds of crazy stuff.

[20:20] battlecollie: Somewhere between 1k and 10k id say, on anything reasonable
[20:20] bradleymeck: 32k+ is generally the absolute limit for (most) operating systems' tcp/ip stack, but even then you wont get there
[20:20] matbee: that's legit, thanks
[20:20] bnoordhuis: taf2: ./configure --jobs=64
[20:20] konobi: 65k per IP, iirc
[20:20] konobi: but then you run into other limitations
[20:21] jbrokc: if i open a node console, tell it to fs.watchFile("/foo") for changes, and then go and save that file. there's a good 2 second delay between the two. is it because i'm watching the file from a node shell? 
[20:21] jbrokc: and the callback is simply a console.log("node!")
[20:21] taf2: bnoordhuis, thanks that's a good one to use too... i'd probably only want --jobs=[2..4] right?  you really have 64 cpus?  
[20:22] taf2: ACTION did 4 and cpu is just about 100% build is going nice and fast
[20:22] bnoordhuis: konobi: on linux it's srcport+srcaddr+dstport+dstaddr
[20:22] matbee: We're looking to run a websocket server, but could reach anywhere from 100-10,000 connections. Do you think nodejs is mature/stable enough for such a load?
[20:22] xerox: since you're more experienced than me: how do you port var foo = function() {}; foo.prop = {}; foo.prop.f = function() {}; to prototypes? function Foo() {}; Foo.prototype.prop = {}; Foo.prototype.prop.f = function() {} <- this last one does not "work".
[20:22] bnoordhuis: taf2: no - but my botnet does

[21:36] jorenl_: isaacs; I'm trying to listen to 81 (80 is apache). I can't really get around that atm (I'd have to physically go over to the place where my server is and open a gate on the routers firewall). so running as root is my only option? :/

[21:37] __directory: >1023 donut require root

[21:37] jorenl_: root for now.
[21:38] __directory: root or suid bit
[21:38] __directory: only options
[21:38] isaacs: yep.  root
[21:40] konobi: or get your firewall to direct traffic from port 80 to your destination port
[21:41] jorenl_: konobi: 80 is being used by apache.
[21:41] Xeon06_ has joined the channel
[21:41] rhaen: 8080 might be a choice
[21:42] rhaen: It's usually open due to proxy or old fashioned java tomcat servers.
[21:43] konobi: 81 then
[21:43] jorenl_: rhaen: I think that router uses it for its web interface to the outside world. I disabled it but it might still reserve the port. +, I can just go over there tomorrow and open whatever port I want :)

[21:54] wao: hello, I've been using nave usemain 0.5.2, but getting this http://fpaste.org/TVRK/ any idea?
[21:54] rhaen: albertosheinfeld: no, I am pretty sure
[21:55] markmarkoh has joined the channel
[21:55] albertosheinfeld: rhaen, why would you think that? besides the obvious reasons
[21:56] cl0udy: albertosheinfeld: imagine u just need to learn js and html
[21:56] rhaen: Just for the common things. Node.js can handle 1 core only - in order to scale you need to stress more cores at once.
[21:56] Xeon06_ has joined the channel
[21:56] cjm has joined the channel
[21:56] meandi has joined the channel
[21:57] rhaen: I think this is the main limit for now. You need something to glue several node.js instances together
[21:57] cl0udy: hmm but then again if u want to do more modular stuff then probably not?
[21:57] __directory: node can kick out into threads and easily be orchestrated so you have a bunch of node processes clustered
[21:57] tony__ has joined the channel
[21:57] rhaen: it could be done using loadbalancers.
[21:57] albertosheinfeld: but if you have event based calls
[21:57] cl0udy: but would u use nodejs for modular stuff?
[21:58] mehtryx has joined the channel
[21:58] albertosheinfeld: what would be the perfect case to use node instead of any other server?
[21:58] cl0udy: if u want event based stuff
[21:58] rhaen: I don't think that the web is designed for this :) 
[21:59] albertosheinfeld: then why so much HYPE about it? i feel like i'm missing a piece here
[21:59] cl0udy: like for simple db querying and processing of variables
[21:59] rhaen: You want node a part of a system for eventbased stuff and webservers for serving different data.
[21:59] cl0udy: yea
[21:59] rhaen: albertosheinfeld: the glory is JavaScript in a competing field
[22:00] cl0udy: db querying and lots of processing of data but not much user interaction then better go with modular based
[22:00] matyr has joined the channel
[22:00] rhaen: You have the wonderful eventbased loop system which is extreme good at just doing nothing :)
[22:00] edude03 has joined the channel
[22:00] albertosheinfeld: so it makes more sense to deep into ruby than node?
[22:00] albertosheinfeld: for example... 
[22:00] cl0udy: yea ruby or php for modular
[22:00] cl0udy: node for event based
[22:00] rhaen: cl0udy: please count perl into that field, too.
[22:01] cl0udy: yea perl too
[22:01] rhaen: cl0udy: I am a Mojolicious lover - so please be fair .)
[22:01] bnoordhuis: modular... you mean threaded or forked?
[22:01] cl0udy: u can still use node+other webservers
[22:01] albertosheinfeld: yeah i was planning on using node only for push to users some data
[22:01] konobi: rhaen: you poor bastard
[22:01] __directory: also node is a lot more than just http crap
[22:01] cl0udy: yea u can run other server types other than a http server with node
[22:01] __directory: tcp/udp mixed with http, etc
[22:01] rhaen: konobi: I love it :) Wrote some documentation for it :)
[22:02] cl0udy: so just run both node +nginx or something
[22:02] konobi: rhaen: i ejected mojo as soon as i could from a previous codebase
[22:02] yozgrahame1 has joined the channel
[22:03] albertosheinfeld: yeah i agree, but i wanted to know why all the hype, i've been testing it and i like it, but i just cannot compare it to apache, etc and i thought i was missing something... that's why i asked :)
[22:03] cl0udy: well dont use apache use nginx/lighttpd
[22:03] Poetro has joined the channel
[22:03] albertosheinfeld: yeah we are migrating
[22:03] cl0udy: i hate apache takes up so much resources

[22:04] gtramont1na has joined the channel
[22:04] albertosheinfeld: i agree in there, we will start with a double layer and then just stay with nginx
[22:04] konobi: rhaen: mainly because there were really stupid API changes that caused me to be constantly changing my code to deal with it
[22:04] rhaen: konobi: true. We declared that feature :) As you have read the docs everything was marked as "can change..."
[22:05] rhaen: konobi: anyway, it's stable in the core now.
[22:05] konobi: rhaen: i'll stick to something that is reliable =0)
[22:05] rhaen: konobi: however, due to some other things my interests move to node.js slowly

[22:46] isaacs: Determinist: it'll just put global packages in ~/local instead of /usr/local

[22:46] odyniec has joined the channel
[22:46] isaacs: Determinist: also, it's actually node itself that loads from ./node_modules.
[22:47] isaacs: Determinist: npm just sets the stage, and then is gone
[22:47] Determinist: isaacs: yeah, that's true, i guess
[22:47] Determinist: isaacs: will npm create bin links for packages if i set the prefix like that?
[22:47] dgathright_ has joined the channel
[22:48] Determinist: isaacs: specifically to ~/bin?
[22:48] isaacs: Determinist: in this case, to ~/local/bin
[22:48] isaacs: Determinist: but you can set ~ as your prefix, instead, if you like
[22:48] Swizec has joined the channel
[22:48] isaacs: Determinist: and only when you install something -g globally
[22:48] Determinist: isaacs: gotcha

[22:54] SubStack: chrisdickinson: I think a require patcher is best as its own module
[22:54] SubStack: I looked through that patch but the problem is I'm using burrito in the browser so I can't rely on the behavior of require() so much

[23:00] Determinist: isaacs: what does 'extraneous' mean in npm's context?
[23:00] losing has joined the channel
[23:00] isaacs: Determinist: it means that you've got something in node_modules that isn't listed as a dep in your package.json
[23:00] isaacs: Determinist: you can npm install blah --save to add it when you install
[23:00] Determinist: isaacs: and it'll just add it to my package.json for me?
[23:01] isaacs: Determinist: or `npm install blah --save --dev` to save it to devDependencies
[23:01] isaacs: Determinist: yeah
[23:01] Determinist: isaacs: cool

[23:13] TheEmpath: so i have a php server sending data to a node.js server.. and php is using a non-blocking server with lingering set on... i'm trying to push into node.js like 300k of data
[23:13] slifty_ has joined the channel
[23:13] TheEmpath: what happens is that the php instance termiantes before the socket finishes sending everything... so i set the SOL_SOCKET lingering to l_onoff 0.  still, the socket doesn't flush everything.
[23:14] TheEmpath: i set the connection as nonblocking at first, until the php instance ends, then i set the lingering to l_onoff 0 and set the socket to blocking.. but no dice... the php instance ends

[23:49] isaacs: shanebo: you using node 0.5?
[23:49] isaacs: CrabDude: in the node source, do `make test-all`
