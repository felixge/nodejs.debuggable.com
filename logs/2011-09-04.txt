[04:47] jamescarr: robbiet480, just use mongoose + mongodb
[04:47] robbiet480: Whats the learning curve like on that?
[04:48] Daegalus: the same as any other database 
[04:49] robbiet480: NoSQL based I see
[04:49] Daegalus: ya
[04:49] robbiet480: hopefully won't be too hard coming from MySQL
[04:49] Daegalus: different mind set. Everything is stored as JSON documents
[04:49] robbiet480: i do like me some json
[04:49] robbiet480: Okay, I'll try it, thanks jamescarr/Daegalus 
[04:50] robbiet480: oh, best MongoDB hosted provider?
[04:50] Daegalus: its why mongo is the prefered atm, since it is JSON or BSON and very easy to interface with a javascript
[04:50] robbiet480: I am on Heroku right now which offers MongoLab and MongoHQ iirc
[04:50] diegoviola: i'm really fed up with rails
[04:50] Daegalus: http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Hosting+Center
[04:50] jamescarr: robbiet480, either
[04:50] Daegalus: that should help robbiet480
[04:50] jamescarr: I have used monghq
[04:50] robbiet480: Ok
[04:50] nitinb has joined the channel
[04:51] Daegalus: This reminds me, which is the better adapter to use, Mongoose or Mongoskin?

[09:03] Nuck|mobile: Never heard of it :P
[09:03] Nuck|mobile: Is it Node?
[09:04] sqpat: huh, turns out it was the 'error' and 'close' events firing for me, not the 'end' event.
[09:05] lmorchard has joined the channel
[09:07] Daegalus: Hmmm, Nuck|mobile, thats a great idea. I should make a forum software in Node
[09:07] __doc__ has joined the channel
[09:07] Nuck|mobile: Daegalus: YUSH!
[09:08] Daegalus: it can be my "Learn Node.js" project
[09:09] fly-away has joined the channel
[09:13] DrMcKay: TheJH: ping?
[09:13] astropirate: Daegalus, we can work on it togather? :D
[09:13] TheJH: DrMcKay, pong :D
[09:13] DrMcKay: TheJH: almost done, testing locally :D
[09:13] TheJH: DrMcKay, wooow, cool!
[09:14] Nuck: Daegalus: I may fork that and adopt it for my site :P
[09:14] TheJH: Daegalus, that'd be a cool thing to have :)
[09:14] Nuck: So give it something reaaaaaaaaallly loose :3
[09:14] Nuck: TheJH: Well, I was gonna write one myself, when the time came
[09:14] TheJH: Daegalus, point me at the repo when you have some code so I can "watch" it :)
[09:14] Daegalus: haha ok
[09:14] Nuck: But if I can adapt somebody else's work, all the better
[09:15] TheJH: ACTION wants to find security vulns in forum software :)
[09:15] Daegalus: Might take me a week or so. I got a lot of projects + college etc. Need to setup a few sprints and stories for myself in Greenhopper
[09:15] DrMcKay: TheJH: coolest one was vuln in reddit
[09:16] DrMcKay: TheJH: it was spreading so fast, because evey onMouseOver on infected link uploaded a new link
[09:16] DrMcKay: s/evey/every/
[09:16] TheJH: DrMcKay, :D
[09:16] Daegalus: Ohhh, should I make it a forum without its own user login system? Where it uses purely OAuth/OpenID/Etc.
[09:16] TheJH: DrMcKay, I think people did the same on twitter
[09:17] TheJH: Daegalus, openid++ :)
[09:17] Nuck: eww
[09:17] Nuck: OAuth2++
[09:17] v8bot_:  Nuck has given a beer to OAuth2. OAuth2 now has 1 beers.
[09:17] Nuck: But nah, provide a hookin for that
[09:17] Nuck: Allow them to make their own modules to deal with that
[09:17] Nuck: Just make it super-mdoular like anything on Node
[09:17] DrMcKay: deoxxa: yup, password auth is soooo '90s
[09:18] DrMcKay: meh, not
[09:18] DrMcKay: Daegalus: ^
[09:18] Daegalus: well I need a few base ones like Twitter, Facebook< Gogole
[09:18] Insekticid has joined the channel
[09:18] Nuck: Daegalus: I'd just use an HTTP Basic module for starters
[09:18] Nuck: Then hook in an OAuth2 and OpenID module
[09:18] Daegalus: hmmm ok
[09:19] Daegalus: I should force MongoDB too :P
[09:19] Nuck: Plus it gives reason to make it modular
[09:19] Nuck: Daegalus: Why?
[09:19] adrianmg has joined the channel
[09:19] Nuck: Provide an abstracted connection to the database too lol
[09:19] Daegalus: actually ya, i thought of that after i said it
[09:19] Daegalus: then let people add adapters if they want something else
[09:20] Nuck: But yes, I would say build on Mongo first
[09:20] Nuck: Yup
[09:20] Nuck: Allow for adapters into the post parsing, etc.
[09:21] Daegalus: yay massive project undertaking, and I have maybe written 4 lines of Node.js :P but I learn better like this, I hate going through mini tutorials. I get some massive project under my belt, and do it, and learn on the way
[09:21] Nuck: Daegalus: Same
[09:21] Nuck: I learned Node by building a chatbot for deviantART
[09:22] Nuck: I then refined it and rebuilt it from the core out for v2
[09:22] Nuck: v1 worked fine except my socket kept silently disconnecting
[09:22] sqpat: big projects are fun
[09:22] Daegalus: lets just hope I can design this properly. Never written forum software before, or anything like it. THe most ive written was a CMS like system for news for my site in PHP
[09:22] Nuck: Nah, medium projects are great
[09:22] sqpat: im learning nodejs by loadtesting a server running it on an atom
[09:23] Nuck: big projects are tiresome
[09:23] Nuck: Like my current one
[09:23] Nuck: So.
[09:23] Nuck: Man.y
[09:23] Nuck: Files.
[09:23] Daegalus: Hmm, maybe I should also aim to keep it as simple and small as possible
[09:23] Nuck: Daegalus: Keep it modularized and it'll manage itself :P
[09:23] Daegalus: true
[09:23] Nuck: Not sure how to deal with that kind of swappable architecture, TBH
[09:24] Nuck: I've never done that before
[09:24] Daegalus: eh Ill figure it out
[09:24] Nuck: I do set up things like that quite often, though
[09:24] diegoviola has left the channel
[09:24] Nuck: But I like to have a mixture of abstractions and finely-tunable stuff so I often opt to do things myself where they could be done by a module
[09:24] Nuck: Anyway,s it's past 2 AM, I'm gonna go to bed
[09:25] Daegalus: oh wow, it is 2 am
[09:25] Daegalus: i should get going too

[11:40] astropirate: Fabryz, require()
[11:40] Fabryz: not working
[11:40] astropirate: Fabryz, http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.5.5/api/modules.html#modules
[11:40] Blizz: Hello, I am new in javascript and In node.js I am creating first "app" I want only server that give me every 5 sec another data. Here is my git https://github.com/JakubRacek/Node.js-fiction-stock-quote-generator  I dont know how to create that 5sec. delay. Because now every I refresh browser, I got another data :/
[11:41] Fabryz: astropirate wait, I have to specify that the class where i need to use the include is shared between the client and server
[11:41] astropirate: huu?
[11:42] skunkape: justinTNT, doc.update(); causes error "TypeError: Object #<model> has no method 'update'"
[11:43] Fabryz: Blizz try using setInterval?
[11:43] astropirate: Blizz, why don't you make an AJAX request every 5 seconds?   using setInterval https://developer.mozilla.org/en/window.setInterval
[11:45] Blizz: Fabryz, astropirate: Wait, I dont want to make that delay on frontend, but on backend, Because I want to use that "server" to pretend quote api
[11:45] Fabryz: yes
[11:45] Fabryz: you can use that on server side too
[11:46] stagas: Blizz: have a currentQuote variable on parent scope that you change on intervals
[11:46] stagas: Blizz: and serve that
[11:46] niftylettuce: garrensmith: added a built script for it, going to make it an npm module soon
[11:47] raynos has joined the channel

[11:51] Blizz: stagas: thank you It looks much beter, only variable what holds that current price and some loop for generating new every % sec. This is what you mean ?
[11:54] stagas: Blizz: yes but since you'll have multiple tickets it's better to put them in quotes.js in an object or something, currentQuotes = {...} and do the interval to update all of them in the module every x secs
[11:55] Blizz: Thank you. And sorry for my newbie question :/ :)

[12:25] Brandon_R: an explaination really
[12:25] DrMcKay: Brandon_R: sup?
[12:25] Brandon_R: what is multicast in node and how it is different from socket.io broadcast function
[12:26] Brandon_R: hi
[12:26] DrMcKay: Brandon_R: multicast socket?
[12:26] Brandon_R: yeah
[12:27] Brandon_R: if i understand correctly both allows a message to be send to all connected
[12:27] fairwinds has joined the channel
[12:27] DrMcKay: Brandon_R: well, socket.io broadcast sends data to all connected listeners (e.g. web browsers), there's a specified protocol, etc.
[12:27] DrMcKay: Brandon_R: but multicast socket is just a way you can transmit packets
[12:28] Brandon_R: oh
[12:28] DrMcKay: Brandon_R: socket.io broadcast is on way higher level than multicast socket
[12:28] Brandon_R: i understand
[12:29] DrMcKay: TheJH: 51 tries :D ?
[12:29] TheJH: btw, I now hate the v8 guys for 'EvalError: The "this" object passed to eval must be the global object from which eval originated' :(
[12:30] DrMcKay: hah! :D
[12:30] kon_: hax!
[12:30] Brandon_R: lol
[12:30] DrMcKay: :D
[12:30] TheJH: otherwise, this would print the node version, I think: require('vm').runInNewContext("c.log=eval.bind(this,'console.log(process.version)')",{c:console});console.log(1)
[12:30] Brandon_R: anyone got an example of a c++ nodejs extention?

[12:33] kon_: Brandon_R, for example https://github.com/isaacs/node-async-simple/blob/master/nas.cc
[12:33] Brandon_R: thanks ill check it out
[12:34] TheJH: DrMcKay, no idea
[12:34] DrMcKay: TheJH: and thanks, now I know how to do error reporting :D
[12:34] Brandon_R: is writing modules in c++ faster than  in js? or about the same speed
[12:34] TheJH: DrMcKay, huh?
[12:34] kon_: you mean writing them or their actual performance? :P
[12:34] Brandon_R: performance
[12:35] DrMcKay: TheJH: I will give this bot a big try catch, bots love try catches
[12:35] kon_: i can only guess. i guess there isn't much difference at all
[12:35] Brandon_R: i'll do some benchmarks if i can get this to work :)

[16:54] DrMcKay: I mean, that's not really the way it should behave
[16:54] `3rdEden: it still works DrMcKay

[19:37] thesaskwatch: hi, is there a way to use npm on windows
[19:37] Nuck: Mongo and Couch are the two Node-favorites
[19:37] Nuck: thesaskwatch: Only under Cygwin
[19:37] kenperkins: if you say so
[19:37] thesaskwatch: I'm using cygwin
[19:38] Nuck: I'm in the Mongo camp.
[19:38] Dmitrijus: Nuck: indeed they are. :)
[19:38] jamescarr: Nuck, not true... Redis and Riak are as well
[19:38] isaacs: thesaskwatch: not yet
[19:38] thesaskwatch: but is it working under cygwin well?
[19:38] Nuck: thesaskwatch: Then do the same install as everywhere
[19:38] kenperkins: we use redis and riak
[19:38] Nuck: isaacs: It's cygwin
[19:38] jbpros has joined the channel
[19:38] Nuck: So it works
[19:38] Nuck: ACTION uses npm under Cygwin
[19:38] jamescarr: I use Mongoose+MongoDB, but I use redis as my session store
[19:38] Nuck: thesaskwatch: As far as I can tell, it works
[19:38] Nuck: It sucks
[19:38] joshkehn: Ug. I don't like Mongoose
[19:38] Nuck: But it works
[19:38] thesaskwatch: ok, thanks
[19:38] Nuck: Mongoose makes me wanna vomit
[19:38] godzirra: Does anyone know if the node_redis module supports hget?  I can't seem to find anything in the docs, but it seems pretty important to miss.
[19:39] godzirra: I'm not getting any errors, its just not getting my value, so I'm curious what I'm doing wrong
[19:39] Nuck: Mongoskin is better than Mongoose
[19:39] Nuck: Schemas can go suck a dick
[19:39] joshkehn: Mongoskin? 
[19:39] kenperkins: I really like the scale out model inherent in rialk
[19:39] kenperkins: riak
[19:40] Nuck: joshkehn: Yeah, a futures-providing wrapper around Mongo
[19:40] kenperkins: plus, riak offeres a nice intergrated lucene like search option
[19:40] joshkehn: Interesting, definitely bookmarking that.
[19:41] isaacs: Nuck: I guess thesaskwatch asked if there was a way, not if there was a *good* way
[19:41] Nuck: isaacs: hehe
[19:41] Nuck: Well, Cygwin works
[19:41] isaacs: i consider Cygwin an unacceptably bad experience.  better to just get a linux vm or something
[19:41] Nuck: Most of the time
[19:41] Nuck: Agreed, but when it works it works finely.
[19:41] isaacs: Nuck: it breaks for someone daily.
[19:41] isaacs: Nuck: and, at best, it's incredibly slow.
[19:41] thesaskwatch: under cygwin I get: TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'lstat'
[19:42] isaacs: Nuck: and there's that ^
[19:42] thesaskwatch: while installing
[19:42] kenperkins: Totally agree with isaacs on that one. Why fuck your windows install up with cygwin when you can install a vm in like 3 minutes
[19:42] Nuck: isaacs: Very true, but it's just REALLY easy to use.
[19:42] Nuck: kenperkins: Nobody can set up a VM in 3 minutes
[19:42] isaacs: Nuck: a vm is only hard once.  cygwin is hard every damn time.
[19:42] thesaskwatch: maybe I'll just try with virtual machine
[19:42] DrMcKay: why fuck up your PC with Windows install, really?
[19:42] isaacs: thesaskwatch: virtualbox is free, but i personally have found vmware to be a bit nicer.
[19:42] Nuck: isaacs: Yes, but I can just change a file and it's done.
[19:42] slickplaid: Nuck: Use vmware ready made images :D Done in 2 minutes!
[19:43] kenperkins: Nuck: VMWare assisted mode can you get your linux iso up in ~3 minutes on my desktop
[19:43] isaacs: also, with vmware, you get snapshots
[19:43] thesaskwatch: isaacs: yeah I have experience with both

[19:46] joshkehn: Or filter through command.
[19:46] joshkehn: By far my favorite feature.
[19:46] kenperkins: Sublime?
[19:46] Daegalus: Why get textmate? you can get full IDEs and such, Netbeans, Eclipse, you can also run Notepad++ through Crossover, or get vim working over there, or jed, or emacs
[19:46] joshkehn: Plus the find and replace sucks in Sublime
[19:46] Nuck: Anyone here use Chocolat?
[19:46] Nuck: ewwwwww Daegalus
[19:46] Nuck: Fuck IDEs
[19:46] kenperkins: I'm currently trying out BBedit. I tried chocolat, coda and passed on them
[19:46] joshkehn: Sublime http://www.sublimetext.com/2

[20:45] TheEmpath: did npm install mime, then i CLIed node and tried var require('mime'); and i got an cannot find mime exception
[20:46] matomesc has joined the channel
[20:46] isaacs: TheEmpath: if you install it locally, you should be able to require() it
[20:46] TheEmpath: i guess i done goofed on configuration somewhere...
[20:46] TheJH: TheEmpath, did you install in the same directory in which you want to use it?
[20:46] isaacs: $ npm install mime
[20:46] isaacs: mime@1.2.2 ./node_modules/mime 
[20:46] isaacs: $ node -e 'require.resolve("mime")'
[20:47] isaacs: . /Users/isaacs/dev-src/js/node/node_modules/mime/mime.js
[20:47] TheEmpath: i see
[20:47] TheEmpath: my project layout is thus: projectRoot [ api, core, libraries, models, public ]
[20:48] TheEmpath: inside libraries is node_modules which has all npm libraries
[20:48] TheEmpath: i start the prject from the projectRoot
[20:48] isaacs: TheEmpath: why not put node_modules in projectRoot?
[20:48] TheEmpath: any config pathing i gotta tinker with/
[20:48] isaacs: where's your package.json file?
[20:48] TheJH: TheEmpath, node_modules must be directly in the project root
[20:48] TheEmpath: ahhh
[20:48] TheEmpath: lemme give that a whirl
[20:48] isaacs: package.json and node_modules should be siblings
[20:49] isaacs: lib is for YOUR modules
[20:49] isaacs: (at least, that's the convention)
[20:49] TheJH: TheEmpath, node won't dig through your whole folder structure :D

[23:12] matyr_ has joined the channel
[23:12] AAA_awright: Nuck: What's a last-mile setup?
[23:12] Nuck: AAA_awright: Basically, you use IRC protocol until the point right before the client
[23:12] uptownben: anyone know what this means:Object.keys called on non-object
[23:12] Nuck: So you connect over socket.io or another transport to that point
[23:12] Nuck: But have a standard protocol for any chat system
[23:13] Nuck: You can swap out the protocol beyond there
[23:13] Nuck: You can even just make that point a server
[23:13] AAA_awright: Nuck: I'm thinking it's the job of the headless client to read IRC or XMPP or whatever, everything after that point uses a common grammar if not a common vocabulary (as much as possible...
[23:13] AAA_awright: I think the client will have to have some knowledge of what a +b is)
[23:13] Nuck: AAA_awright: I wouldn't call it a headless client
[23:13] AAA_awright: I think that's a better term than core
[23:14] AAA_awright: It is a headless client, it's a client that you attach to
[23:14] Nuck: I mean, it could be a client or it could be a server
[23:14] Nuck: I could write a server that speaks your protocol
[23:14] AAA_awright: headless implies it's a server that you attach to
[23:14] ypcx has joined the channel
[23:14] Nuck: I mean a chat server
