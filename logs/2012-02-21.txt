[00:08] mikeric: is there a single command way to start a node app that requires a few command and processes to run? for example, i need to do "~/build/redis-2.2.111-scripting/src/redis-server", "make", and "node server.js" every time i want to use my node app locally.
[00:08] mikeric: is using "npm start" capable of running those?

[00:11] isaacs: mc: yeah, it just does `npm run-script start`
[00:11] isaacs: mc: once upon a time, i imagined it'd grow into a service manager.
[00:11] mc: oh i see
[00:11] mc: not potentially your 'start' script could be 'node dostuff.js' or similar?

[00:14] dtrejo: @isaacs Is it true that npm will not look for linked versions of its own deps? I'm working on the npat test reporting module, but my linked npm won't reference my linked report module
[00:15] dtrejo: Going to try doing a `make install` on npm instead of make link, and see if that fixes things
[00:17] ningu: hmm. looks like you can use the spider module for it.
[00:18] davv3 has joined the channel

[00:21] isaacs: i dunno
[00:21] dtrejo: ok, thanks, im going to keep playing around and see what happens
[00:22] dtrejo: how do you usually develop one of your own modules that npm depends on?

[00:25] mikeric: isaacs: would that work if those scripts are processes that need to keep running? for example i start the redis-scripting server in the "pre start" script, that works but it doesn't get past that because it's waiting for it to finish.. (so i just see the redis server output)

[00:27] mikeric: benvie, isaacs: ok, makes sense. thanks.
[00:27] isaacs: dtrejo: i write a test for it, then i make it pass that test, then i install it in npm and make sure it fixes the bug in npm.
[00:28] isaacs: dtrejo: as if i'm 2 people, one consuming from the other
[00:28] isaacs: dtrejo: occasinally, i'll just develop it in npm/node_modules first.

[00:47] tiglionabbit: isaacs: interesting.  http://friendpaste.com/6GS2pkpMcDf7Ssii4RBmHG
[00:47] tiglionabbit: the sudo one is missing /usr/local/lib/node_modules which is the value of $NODE_PATH
[00:47] tiglionabbit: why isn't it getting that?
[00:47] isaacs: tiglionabbit: node -v; sudo node -v

[00:48] isaacs: tiglionabbit: eval 'echo $PATH'; sudo eval 'echo $PATH'

[00:49] tiglionabbit: er, sudo: eval: command not found.  It works when I'm not sudoing though
[00:49] shanebo: any socket.io folk in here? I'm trying to emit a front end event from within an express-like route
[00:49] isaacs: tiglionabbit: try: sudo bash -c 'echo $PATH'
[00:50] isaacs: tiglionabbit: you can't reliably test with `sudo echo $PATH`, because the shell expands $PATH before passing the command to sudo.
[00:50] isaacs: so, sudo sees only "echo /path1:/path2:etc"
[00:50] tiglionabbit: with sudo: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin without sudo: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
[00:50] isaacs: tiglionabbit: but i'll bet that the sudo shell and your regular shell don't have the same NODE_PATH environ
[00:51] isaacs: tiglionabbit: sudo node -pe 'process.env.NODE_PATH'
[00:51] tiglionabbit: hm, with sudo there's no $NODE_PATH
[00:51] isaacs: there ya go.
[00:51] tiglionabbit: undefined
[00:51] tiglionabbit: how do I fix that?
[00:51] isaacs: tiglionabbit: why not just run `npm link http-parser` to link it local, anyway?
[00:51] ricedog: dunno if i'm a socket.io guy but i managed to put something together with it
[00:51] tiglionabbit: isaacs: what does that mean?
[00:51] isaacs: tiglionabbit: using require() to load globally-installed modules is not supported.
[00:51] isaacs: tiglionabbit: like it says in `npm faq`

[00:52] superlou has joined the channel
[00:52] tiglionabbit: isaacs: how do you require globally installed modules then?
[00:52] isaacs: tiglionabbit: you can MAKE it work, by setting environs, or passing the full path, etc.
[00:52] isaacs: tiglionabbit: you install them locally :)
[00:52] isaacs: tiglionabbit: or you symlink them locally, using `npm link`
[00:52] isaacs: tiglionabbit: run `npm faq`
[00:52] tiglionabbit: isaacs: wait what why?
[00:52] isaacs: tiglionabbit: run `npm faq`
[00:52] tiglionabbit: why can't they be global?
[00:53] shanebo: ricedog did you manage to emit a front end event within accepting a request on a regular http server?
[00:53] isaacs: ACTION refraining from any more repetition.

[00:55] ricedog: as long as you've got the connection already ..

[00:55] isaacs: tiglionabbit: it's not hard to get what you're after.

[00:56] shanebo: ricedog i've tried the io.sockets.in(room).emit('foo', data) but it doesn't work

[00:56] ningu: jquery for scraping is officially really awesome.
[00:56] isaacs: tiglionabbit: plus, it's really not ideal anyway, for all the same reasons that global variables are not ideal.
[00:56] ningu: not sure why I never thought of this before... probably cause I didn't have node ;)

[00:57] isaacs: tiglionabbit: you alreayd have it installed globally, so this just sets up a symbolic link from ./node_modules/http-proxy to the global one.
[00:57] ricedog: then it's json data between the two
[00:57] isaacs: tiglionabbit: no need to be sad.
[00:58] tiglionabbit: isaacs: wtf it's giving me permission errors and telling me to run it as root.  Why should I run link as root?  These files are owned by my user

[02:24] westg: don't need apache
[02:24] jakehow has joined the channel
[02:24] Xtrivity: yes I know, but i already have an apache server. I am wondering if it'd be dumb to do all one one server
[02:24] Xtrivity: or if I should just run a few servers for stability
[02:25] jarek has joined the channel
[02:25] westg: you mean load balancing across multiple servers running apache?
[02:25] rwaldron has joined the channel
[02:25] kbhit: depends on how important high availability is to you  as well
[02:26] Xtrivity: No i mean. I have an apache server. and i am planning on creating a nodejs server. Some people say just run both servers on the same box. I am thinking splitting for yeah, essentially load balancing.
[02:26] boltR has joined the channel
[02:27] Xtrivity: I dont want my server to crash due to load. lol, figured this would be an easy "run seperately" or "it doesn't matter run them both on one box"
[02:27] Xtrivity: just wondering what best practices would be.
[02:27] diogogmt has joined the channel
[02:28] westg: well
[02:28] westg: for 10k users chatting at once
[02:28] westg: it probably wouldn't hurt to run both servers on one box
[02:28] westg: but if you start exceeding that
[02:28] westg: you might want to split them
[02:29] westg: 10k isn't high enough to get another box though. assuming you have a 100/100 connection and more than enough memory on it
[02:29] westg: at least
[02:29] zeade has joined the channel
[02:29] Xtrivity: well what's memory usage like?
[02:29] westg: for node?
[02:29] westg: depends
[02:29] Xtrivity: yeah with that many sockets open
[02:30] Xtrivity: I could always get another box later, but you ahve to take into consideration my app gets thousands of views a day  as well.
[02:30] Xtrivity: (web app)
[02:30] westg: well I mean you're just running on one server right now right?
[02:30] Xtrivity: at the moment, yes, but always plan for expansion.
[02:31] westg: so by using node you would just, in effect, be separating the chatting/realtime tasks with socket.io to node instead of dealing with them with apache
[02:31] kbhit: or is it a new app/net new workload?
[02:31] mraleph has joined the channel
[02:31] westg: so staying on the same box to share the work would actually free up a bit of the resources for you due to the event loop nature of node
[02:32] westg: net workload = same -> stay on same box
[02:32] diogogmt has joined the channel
[02:32] kbhit: if anything, node should have much small footprint then apache then
[02:32] westg: yea

[03:08] orlandovftw has joined the channel
[03:09] kevbook: hi, I just started with node.js - express framework seems like the recommended choice -- but express tends to use node.js to serve images , css etc -- is this the right thing to do (ryan's presentation said node is bad for static content). I would rather use S3/CDN to serve that. Is there a sample app that does this i can learn from.
[03:09] teadict: put nginx on the side
[03:10] deluded: I am also thinking of using CloudFront / S3 CDN for static files
[03:10] teadict: or cloudy stuff if online
[03:10] teadict: yes
[03:10] deluded: That would all be controlled by the URLs in the CSS, no?
[03:11] deluded: and that initial CSS can be pulled from CloudFront, too
[03:11] carlyle has joined the channel
[03:11] diogogmt has joined the channel
[03:11] deluded: so, it wouldn't  / shouldn't hit node if I'm correct
[03:11] teadict: client downloads html+css, client encounters uri, goes there and fetches
[03:11] SubStack: isaacs: it does
[03:11] kevbook: linkedin engeering blog says, even serve html (js) template from CDN - use underscore etc -- just serve json using node
[03:11] isaacs: SubStack: ok, make that PATH=$PATH:my:stuff instead.
[03:12] isaacs: SubStack: or just wait a few minutes.
[03:12] isaacs: fixing this now.
[03:12] teadict: you're not making a linked in network :P
[03:12] jaw187: that
[03:12] kevbook: just trying to learn with best practices
[03:13] justicefries: best practices can be very complicated, convoluted, and entirely situational.
[03:13] jaw187: drop a lot of money on a big SAN
[03:13] mmalecki: isaacs: you're implementing this crazy bash rc loading stuff?
[03:13] justicefries: learn what makes you learn best.
[03:13] jaw187: nothing but SSD
[03:13] deluded: how does the initial bootstrap of the HTML work when you hit the site for first time given node is pushing just JSON on the request? 
[03:13] mmalecki: isaacs: I kinda want it but it makes it work on bash only, so lame
[03:14] kevbook: @deluded .. thats what i am unsure..

[03:14] justicefries: kevbook: read above what I said.
[03:14] fairwinds: hi, anyone aware of a branching stream package. ie multiple writing with singe stream reading
[03:14] fairwinds: s/ singe  single

[03:15] gr4yscale has joined the channel
[03:15] kevbook: @ justicefries - i just joined irc
[03:15] justicefries: kevbook: there's a time and a place to learn how to scale the crap out of things, learning node.js isn't necessarily that time.
[03:15] justicefries: kevbook: Ik now, I said some things to you
[03:15] justicefries: <justicefries> best practices can be very complicated, convoluted, and entirely situational.
[03:15] kevbook: ok, yea i can tend to premature optimize
[03:15] isaacs: mmalecki: nave is written in bash.
[03:15] justicefries: <justicefries> learn what makes you learn best.
[03:16] isaacs: mmalecki: sh and ksh and zsh are off the reservation.
[03:16] justicefries: you'll have tons of time to premature optimize
[03:16] justicefries: get up and running first
[03:16] kevbook: should i even use express? or just build a routing from scratch
[03:16] maxogden: fairwinds: you want to pipe to the same readable stream twice? whats the use case?
[03:16] justicefries: nah, express is a fine way to go.
[03:16] kevbook: ok..
[03:16] teadict: you should recode node
[03:16] justicefries: understanding how building it from scratch works is good, but you might as well get some feedback and wrap your mind around callbacks and how IO works.
[03:16] teadict: from scratch
[03:16] teadict: LOLOLOL
[03:16] maxogden: fairwinds: cause the stream api isnt designed to logically support that

[03:17] mmalecki: isaacs: oh well. I still have hope I'll make give work in zsh
[03:17] Sahua_ has joined the channel
[03:17] mmalecki: but zsh is kinda retarded when it comes to handling env vars
[03:17] isaacs: mmalecki: i mean, it'll work in zsh, it just won't automagically get the right init file necessarily, if your zshrc sets the path explicitly
[03:17] isaacs: mmalecki: seems fine enough to me
[03:18] mmalecki: isaacs: no, it won't. when you launch `PATH=sth:$PATH zsh`, it'll append sth to the end of the PATH

[03:22] teadict: *rich
[03:23] mmalecki: lol
[03:23] maxogden: fairwinds: oh i misunderstood your original question, you can pipe a single readable to multiple writables

[03:23] fairwinds: maxogden: ah k. that is what I am looking to do, thanks
[03:24] maxogden: fairwinds: you just cant pipe twice to the same writable
[03:24] maxogden: fairwinds: also make sure you do all your piping before process.nextTick
[03:25] shanebo has joined the channel
[03:25] isaacs: hm, apparently you can't set the rcfile explicitly with zsh
[03:25] isaacs: oh well, no one really uses that anyway.
[03:25] mmalecki: yeah, well, some hipster shit
[03:25] fairwinds: maxogden: super, make things pretty easy
[03:25] isaacs: mmalecki: you'll have the same problem in bash if you set your PATH explicitly
[03:25] teadict: what? zsh, no
[03:25] maxogden: fairwinds: e.g. when you create a readable stream you have to pipe it to all your destinations right away cause data will start coming in on the next tick
[03:26] fairwinds: maxodgen: great, good to know
[03:26] fairwinds: thx

[06:23] davidbanham: So I'm writing a module that accesses someone else's API, it uses request. What should I do when there's an error in request? Should I throw an exception or just pass back "error" to my user's callback?
[06:24] maxogden: davidbanham: can you elaborate on what 'my user's callback' means 
[06:24] sechrist_: holy crap at stracing the rdoc installing
[06:25] davidbanham: maxogden: So my user calls daveAPI.call(somedata, function() { a handler });
[06:25] davidbanham: I go off and send that data to this external API with request.
[06:25] davidbanham: Request gives me back an error. Network destination unreachable or something.
[06:26] davidbanham: Throw an exception or callback({errMsg: "Network destination unreachable"});
[06:27] davidbanham: As a user of this thing, would you expect it to throw and possibly take down your process or would you want to look for an error object being present in every callback?
[06:27] maxogden: davidbanham: a common pattern would be daveAPI.call(somedata, function(err, responseData) { if (err) { //let user decide } })
[06:27] maxogden: davidbanham: the latter, you basically bubble errors all the way up
[06:27] maxogden: davidbanham: i was just confused over your usage of the term 'my user', i thought you were talking about something more complicated
[06:27] davidbanham: maxogden: Cool. I'll run with that.

[06:36] wookiehangover: if any of the contributors are around

[06:36] davidbanham: util is something that comes baked into node. utils could be a package name, but it would be a confusing choice.

[10:56] benvie: but yeah it's going to be a bit of manual labor I guess to just swap out any references based on window specific measurements
[10:56] r04r has joined the channel
[10:56] r04r has joined the channel
[10:56] benvie: and then you can add a couple extra properties to the terminal like
[10:56] chjj: eddyb: what do you mean it uses the whole document?
[10:57] TheFuzzball has joined the channel
[10:57] benvie: Object.defineProperty(Term.prototype, 'width', { get: function(){ return this.width || window.clientWidth } })
[10:57] eddyb: chjj: instead of being it's own element, it just uses the entire page
[10:57] eddyb: s/being/having/
[10:58] chjj: eddyb: thats what tty.js is there for, if you notice, term.js doesnt make any assumptions about the page, tty.js has to hook into everything
[10:58] chjj: i specifically designed it that way
[10:58] Glenjamin has joined the channel
[10:58] benvie: Object.defineProperty(Term.prototype, 'width', { get: function(){ return this.hasOwnProperty('_width') ? this._width || window.clientWidth } })

[10:59] benvie: I think he's referring to a higher level interface. Which you provide in the repo but is also primitive in that it's doing the minimum required
[10:59] chjj: eddyb: although youre right, ive considered moving a lot of the stuff in tty.js to term.js
[10:59] benvie: just load the thing up into the whole window, basically demo level
[10:59] chjj: eddyb: like the wrapper and the window behavior, etc
[11:00] skylamer` has joined the channel
[11:00] robi42 has joined the channel
[11:00] eddyb: tty.js doesn't change the fact that term.js is operating on document, document.body, document.element

[11:01] r04r has joined the channel
[11:02] eddyb: yeah, and I'd be glad to help
[11:02] benvie: three projects in one really. The one he mentioned breaking off is the pty stuff, then the readline interface combined with the ansi interpreter, and finally a terminal application built on top

[11:03] xbayrockx has joined the channel
[11:04] xbayrockx has joined the channel
[11:04] chjj: eddyb: im confused, you want term.js to be completely divorced from the dom? or you want it to be possible to specify a context?
[11:05] eddyb: I'd want to specify a context, or even have the Terminal constructor to make it's own container, like a <div>
[11:05] eddyb: it would also be nice to use jquery, instead of all that bare-bone DOM
[11:06] chjj: eddyb: certain things like the key events and mouse events are going to have to bind to the document, or a document in order to work properly
[11:06] eddyb: that doesn't sound good...
[11:06] chjj: eddyb: i would consider adding a dom lib to the tty.js part, not the term.js part
[11:07] chjj: eddyb: it doesnt sound good, but thats the way it works
[11:07] r04r has joined the channel
[11:07] eddyb: term.js does a lot of DOM stuff jquery can cleanly replace, btw
[11:07] hz has joined the channel
[11:07] eddyb: and maybe those key and mouse events can be hooked on focus and unhooked on defocus
[11:08] chjj: eddyb: thats kind of how it works
[11:08] chjj: eddyb: they have to bind mouseup and mousemove to the document to work properly
[11:09] dekub has left the channel
[11:11] eddyb: so, why don't you want jquery?
[11:12] chjj: eddyb: i dont want it in term.js because term.js is a separate module. i dont use dom libraries for libraries themselves.
[11:12] r04r has joined the channel
[11:12] chjj: eddyb: in the same way youll notice socket.io doesnt use a dom library, despite interacting with the dom a lot
[11:12] robi42 has joined the channel
[11:12] eddyb: oh, it's forked from jslinux
[11:13] chjj: eddyb: yes
[11:13] chjj: i used the jslinux vt100 as the base, rewrote and refactored it, then added the major xterm csi codes it was missing
[11:14] chjj: in the process of finishing up compatibility and implementing the lesser used ones
[11:14] eddyb: ok, so just adding some context would be enough, I guess
[11:15] chjj: yeah, i wouldnt be opposed to that at all

[11:17] chjj: eddyb: honestly, looking at it now, theres probably not much left of the original jslinux vt100 except a few csi codes and the basic design of the rendering engine, but it did help me get started, and fabrice bellard was nice enough to give me permission to use it.
[11:17] thalll has joined the channel
[11:18] chjj: the way character attributes are handled is also the same way jslinux originally handled them
[11:18] chjj: packing everything into bits!
[11:18] maritz: oh wait, i just triggered gc somehow... :D
[11:18] eddyb: chjj: oh, not sure if you noticed, in my version, the client-side passes a callback when creating a terminal, and the server-side uses that callback to send an id back
[11:19] eddyb: I know it's hard to get a mismatch between the client and the server's IDs
[11:19] eddyb: but this way, all the IDs are computed on the server

[11:21] chjj: eddyb: that sounds like a good idea. it is possible to get a ismatch if the client was doing something really funky.

[11:43] robi42 has joined the channel
[11:43] eddyb: I guess the full-screen stuff stuck with me as being "a good reason"

[14:07] bard: http://pastebin.com/xve3KAVg the server works fine but i only nodeio.start() to be called when the client sends data
[14:07] trakowski77: I'm trying to understand which MySQL driver should I use to connect to MySQL
[14:07] bard: thats why there is an if statement there to check

[14:08] trakowski77: and I'm not sure what's going on there. 
[14:08] jaw187: bard: you should be calling nodeio.start() inside a callback run when the data event is emitted by the socket
[14:08] bard: jaw187, does createserver take a callback perimeter?
[14:09] bard: parameter*
[14:09] eddyb: bard: that callback is for when a client connects

[15:33] `3rdEden: i wouldn't call it better

[18:51] jtsnow has joined the channel
[18:51] bradleymeck: the rest, idk
[18:51] megalomix: so i can use AES_ENCRYPT()

[18:52] megalomix: to encrypt/decrypt data
[18:52] tmike: node has crypto
[18:52] bradleymeck: russfrank it was readded, it was removed due to maintainance issues, and only datagram sockets
[18:52] megalomix: if i write this key in a file like: config.js 
[18:52] megalomix: it does not make sense
[18:52] bradleymeck: russfrank, its coming back though
[18:52] megalomix: who can access to the server could read the key and decrypt data
[18:52] timoxley: bradleymeck that's excellent. why are you so sure of Collections
[18:52] megalomix: tmike, yes i know, but i need to pass a key always

[18:53] [g2} has joined the channel
[18:53] bradleymeck: timoxley, GC of object to object mappings without them are just not practical
[18:53] megalomix: but if i do something in c++ it is more difficult to read

[18:53] megalomix: no?
[18:53] tmike: No, somebody could still run strings on your executable
[18:53] tmike: Unless the key is raw binary
[18:54] tmike: You can always store the key in a file and make the file only readable by the user running the node process, no?
[18:54] tmike: I mean, flat files holding database credentials has been a staple of web development since the beginning of time.

[20:25] jetienne has joined the channel
[20:25] yawNO: i love valid ecmascript
[20:25] ningu: the general pattern is to pass a callback which takes an error as its first argument and results as the second argument or possibly multiple arguments

[20:25] webjames: i'm trying to write a while loop and it seem to be blocking. while(!readyToEnd) { ... }
[20:26] dreamdust: There's no way to write a while loop that doesn't block...
[20:26] Starky: okay, so say i need to call a function in a async manner, the func has its own callback, so do i do it like for(){process.nextTick(fn)} or a direct loop iver the function is enough to start the all func instances async to each other??
[20:26] tmike: Use setInterval or events
[20:26] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[20:26] QaDeS: ningu, i can't find an example on how to cleanly get this to work. unlike the "old" version, the cluster interface seems pretty low level
[20:26] tmike: that was for webjames 
[20:26] mAritz: QaDeS: do you mean learnboost-cluster? unfortunately doesn't work on 0.6.x due to the core module cluster.

[20:27] mAritz: QaDeS: looked at the node.js docs for cluster? should have proper examples in there
[20:27] josh-k has joined the channel
[20:27] ningu: Starky: your code will continue in the callback. you don't loop over the async call
[20:27] Starky: ohh, stupid me shud hv unstand tht,
[20:28] Starky: k, "continue in callback" - you mean blocked by the callback, th enext iteration wont take place
[20:28] Starky: till the callback returns?
[20:28] ningu: the next iteration of what?
[20:28] ningu: the async function will return before it completes, that's what async means...
[20:28] Starky: say i initiate the func in a loop
[20:28] ningu: no, the loop will continue

[20:29] robhawkes has joined the channel

[20:29] oht has joined the channel
[20:29] ningu: if it takes a callback argument, it is async
[20:29] QaDeS: mAritz, the examples i found are for cluster+http, not express
[20:29] Starky: @ningu, okay looking at tht now
[20:30] QaDeS: looks like i'd have to build the app separately for each worker, or am i mistaken?
[20:30] ningu: I still find the async module a bit tricky, but that's because I've been dealing today with data that's nested at four or five levels deep and the control flow is different at each level
[20:30] hackband has joined the channel
[20:31] Renegade001 has joined the channel

[20:31] AndreasMadsen: QaDeS: there is no difference. The cluster is done on a TCP level so HTTP and express there build on that works fine.
[20:31] AndreasMadsen: QaDeS: no you couldn't need to make you own app for each worker, and you can't.

[20:33] AndreasMadsen: QaDeS: The only difference from running anything there use TCP with or without cluster is the need for if (isMaster) {} else {} 
[20:33] orlandovftw has joined the channel
[20:33] AndreasMadsen: QaDeS: there is some problems if you use socket.io, just so you know.
[20:34] ningu: can node apps be clustered out of the box, or do you have to take that into account when writing them?
[20:34] ningu: I realize that might depend on the app...
[20:34] AndreasMadsen: ningu: unless you use socket.io, it works out of the box
[20:35] localhost has joined the channel
[20:35] ningu: what about database race conditions? I suppose that's more of a mongodb-internal issue, since that's what I'm using. but I'm kind of wondering.

[20:36] vicapow: as anyone found a need using mongoose for a "safeIfCurrent" style function?

[20:38] QaDeS: ok, seems to work. thanks everyone!
[20:38] AndreasMadsen: ningu: Starting in 1.5.2, multi updates yield occasionally so you can safely update large amounts of data. If you want a multi update to be truly isolated (so no other writes happen while processing the affected documents), you can use the $atomic flag in the query expression. For example:
[20:38] AndreasMadsen: ^ http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Updating
[20:39] ningu: AndreasMadsen: cool, will read up on that

[22:45] JohnFoo: I'm a little bit confused about the async thing in node. I have to get, I say 3 views from a couchdb.
[22:45] thefoobar: hi, i am trying to get node_mysql to work, however I always get an ECONNREFUSED error (http://dpaste.com/706549/). the backtrace is not really helpful. i am 100% sure, i have the right username + password. what can i do
[22:46] JohnFoo: Do I have to put every request in the callback of the other one?
[22:46] davidbanham: thefoobar: That's not a username/password issue, looks like the network connection is being rejected. Can you access the database from that machine with the mysql command line client?

[22:47] thefoobar: davidbanham: yes. ohh no. i think i know what the problem is…
[22:47] davidbanham: JohnFoo: That's one way of doing it. Another would be to have an event listener that listens for the "finish" event of the couch call and only goes on and does stuff when it's received 3

[22:49] JohnFoo: Ok, thank you for your input.... I'll read on, try the two ways...

[23:22] Xedecimal: I created a multicast datagram packet (now that node has my multicast features!) and all was working wonderful until I attempted to send two packets very quickly. It'll die with a "addMembership EINVAL" . I was starting to think maybe I couldn't add to the membership because something didn't unload on a previous run, but a single 'send' call goes through great! I made a callback on the send...
[23:22] Xedecimal: ...and pushed into an array of outputs and shifted out messages per-callback until the buffer was empty, but the second send once again kills it, do I need to do something between sends ?
[23:23] Xedecimal: all the examples I've read so far on the node site only show sending a single packet and then closing the connection
