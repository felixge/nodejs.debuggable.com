[00:13] hotroot: I know I've asked before, but if anyone is interested in a telnet based hacking game, I'm working on one, so msg me if interested in giving ideas/code.
[00:13] andrew12: hotroot: what do you mean?
[00:13] zomg: hotroot: play uplink, take all good ideas from it
[00:13] cmr: hotroot: Sounds fun to play
[00:13] zomg: :D
[00:13] andrew12: uplink is a fun game
[00:13] hotroot: zomg: Just played like 12 hours of uplink for ideas =P
[00:14] zomg: Heh :D
[00:14] sajan: andrew .. it is here gist: 1512424
[00:14] andrew12: sajan: i know, i'm looking at it.
[00:14] cmr: I didn't really like uplink, tbh, I got bored real fast
[00:14] andrew12: cmr: me too
[00:14] hotroot: The problem is I really don't like the "cracker 2 beats firewall 1" thing, but I'll probably have to go with something similar

[00:18] shaggydog97: I have one identical box that's ok though, but this one is very low on disk space
[00:18] andrew12: well i guess it's anonymous
[00:18] hotroot: I mean I don't want every update being posted to github so anyone who wants to steal my clients can just do a daily update
[00:18] eastc: can anyone tell me the difference between all the http frameworks for node
[00:18] eddanger has joined the channel
[00:18] eastc: I'm a little confused between express, connect and all the others
[00:18] sajan: its a weird issue .. i seem to have all the required packages with me
[00:18] hotroot: At this point it's just basic telnet handling pretty much
[00:19] andrew12: eastc: there's only one real 'http framework', that's the one built into node called http
[00:19] shaggydog97: sajan: is your box low on disk space?
[00:19] sajan: i dont think so .. let me check
[00:20] shaggydog97: I was hoping that if I get disk clean, my prob would disappear
[00:20] joshontheweb has joined the channel
[00:20] eastc: or the various web development frameworks i guess
[00:20] andrew12: eastc: connect is part of express if i understand it correctly
[00:20] andrew12: i don't know of any others though
[00:20] sajan: well i have around 2 GB of space free
[00:20] tjholowaychuk: andrew12 express builds ontop of connect
[00:20] chrisvwebdev has left the channel
[00:20] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[00:20] sajan: dont think its a space issue
[00:20] andrew12: spaaaaaaaaaaaaaace!
[00:21] eastc: so express is basically a standard module installation for node I guess. something that most people get right after npm i'm guessing
[00:21] shaggydog97: os?
[00:21] andrew12: eastc: i think express is supposed to be like http://www.sinatrarb.com/
[00:21] sajan: centos
[00:21] tjholowaychuk: eastc it's just an abstraction layer making some common web app things simpler
[00:21] sajan: linux ofcourse
[00:21] shaggydog97: humâ€¦I'm on rhel5, so could be same issue
[00:21] sajan: looks so
[00:22] sajan: 32 or 64 bit ?
[00:22] niftylettuce_: ummmmmmmm http://i.imgur.com/5f1pp.png
[00:22] niftylettuce_: JOYENT RAWR
[00:22] eastc: so express is the abstraction layer that makes web development easy and equates to using something like apache or nginx
[00:22] shaggydog97: 64
[00:23] sajan: yup same
[00:23] tjholowaychuk: eastc no
[00:23] descipher: sajan: what's your path -> error trying to exec 'cc1plus': execvp: No such file or directory 
[00:23] benlyn has joined the channel
[00:23] tjholowaychuk: eastc node would be more like nginx
[00:23] cmr: eastc: No, apache and nginx are web servers.
[00:23] cmr: eastc: It's more like flask is to python.
[00:23] tjholowaychuk: eastc learn node first
[00:23] andrew12: niftylettuce_: huh, that's weird.
[00:23] tjholowaychuk: with no frameworks
[00:23] andrew12: niftylettuce_: oh, no it's not. click 'sign up' or 'log in'

[00:24] niftylettuce_: andrew12: no buts.
[00:24] shaggydog97: sajan: doffing my "yum list" between boxes

[00:25] niftylettuce_: ryah: ^^ pass along message plz n thx :D
[00:25] shaggydog97: I have libevent.i386 and .x86_64 on the broken box
[00:25] andrew12: niftylettuce_: my initial impression think of that, i actually clicked the button that was there.
[00:25] shaggydog97: but only .x86_64 on the good one
[00:25] cmr: andrew12: My first impression was, "Where's the textbox?"
[00:25] descipher: sajan: I think so ... it can find cc1plus
[00:26] niftylettuce_: the whitespace makes users think that there should be something there, but there isn't, its empty
[00:26] cmr: especially "log in"
[00:26] sajan: what is cc1plus ?
[00:26] niftylettuce_: andrew12: ^^
[00:26] descipher: s/can/can't
[00:26] niftylettuce_: design fail 101
[00:26] shaggydog97: what's min python version for 6.6?
[00:27] sajan: python version is 2.6
[00:28] joshontheweb has joined the channel
[00:28] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[00:28] descipher: its c++
[00:28] sajan: i have gcc
[00:28] eastc: so i can make everything with node itself and no modules at all
[00:28] descipher: sajan: try yum install gcc-c++
[00:28] eastc: but obviously that's not the optimal way to do it
[00:29] cmr: eastc: of course
[00:29] eastc: all the modules are like microframeworks i guess
[00:29] cmr: No... they are like modules.
[00:29] cmr: SOME of the modules are frameworks, yes.
[00:29] rwaldron has joined the channel
[00:29] cmr: They are comparable to a library in C, or a module in python
[00:30] eastc: ah

[00:33] eastc: node > php so what's the point of that ^
[00:33] nathan has joined the channel
[00:33] cmr: eastc: Lots of existing PHP codebases.
[00:33] eastc: so it's a bandaid fix instead of completely replacing all the php scripts
[00:33] cmr: That's one use, yes.
[00:33] andrew12: "This is omega-alpha-super-beta-proof-of-concept"

[00:36] sajan: well i didnt realize that g++ was not there
[00:36] sajan: so i installed that .. its working now
[00:36] sajan: i mean atleast the make moved ahead
[00:36] eastc: and so this functions as a mysql client in node: https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql
[00:36] shaggydog97: I'm still stuck
[00:36] cmr: eastc: Yep, though I've heard that mysql < postgres
[00:37] maletor has joined the channel
[00:37] eastc: what's postgres?
[00:37] sajan: make sure you have everything that the configure checks for
[00:37] cmr: Another sql server, that I've heard is much better than mysql.
[00:37] shaggydog97: I don't, not sure how to fix
[00:37] eastc: relational?
[00:37] andrew12: postgres is a different sql server that's apparently better than mysql.. cmr you type too fast.
[00:37] cmr: I don't know enough about either to have an opinion.
[00:37] cmr: Yes.
[00:37] sajan: what is it that it says ... "not found"
[00:37] htoothrot: postgres all the way
[00:37] shaggydog97: dl, util, and rt
[00:37] andrew12: sqlite ftw
[00:38] hotroot: ^^
[00:38] eastc: does it work the same on the frontend though?
[00:38] eastc: queries and all
[00:38] shaggydog97: and Checking for fdatasync(2) with c++ : no
[00:38] cmr: eastc: Yes, it's the SQL language.
[00:38] cmr: It's a standard you know. Support varies.
[00:38] andrew12: yuck, SQL
[00:38] Renegade001 has joined the channel
[00:38] andrew12: I try to avoid SQL as much as possible
[00:38] eastc: and node can communicate directly with it or do i need a module or something
[00:38] cmr: andrew12: Why?
[00:38] hotroot: I'm using sqlite for my hacker game right now and it's great. Seriously doubt that my telnet game will ever require multiple servers, so I think I'm good =)
[00:38] abraxas has joined the channel
[00:38] eastc: andrew12: what do you use instead of sql?
[00:39] andrew12: well I try not to need a database

[01:08] shaggydog97: I symlinked the version I had to the version make wanted, re ./configure 'd and BAM!
[01:08] jocafa: yes. but it was mostly due to permissions and having an existing nginx install
[01:09] hotroot: Someone should just rewrite a basic http server in node so people will stop bitching =P
[01:09] cmr: jocafa: Is it an abstraction of gitolite or do they implement their own?
[01:09] jocafa: it uses gitolite
[01:10] cmr: Did you have an existing gitolite setup or did you make a fresh one?
[01:10] jocafa: fresh

[01:45] eastc: i mean instead of http://localhost:port/socket.io/socket.io.js why not just /socket.io.js from the local folder or something
[01:46] eastc: so serving from the socket.io server is just for convienience>
[01:46] eastc: ?

[01:54] rohitcolinrao: anyone have any experience with now.js?
[01:55] cmr: tab1293: Just use npm

[01:55] andrew12: i had a feeling he was going to respond :p
[01:55] andrew12: cmr: YES.
[01:55] rohitcolinrao: i'm trying to set up a real-time site stack
[01:55] pauls1: rohitcolinrao: i do. i would recommend using dnode unless you need something particularly about now.js, as now.js has some issues
[01:55] rohitcolinrao: found socketstream
[01:55] rohitcolinrao: and now
[01:55] cmr: andrew12: Only 200k USD!
[01:55] rohitcolinrao: ah
[01:56] rohitcolinrao: haven't read about dnode yet
[01:56] rohitcolinrao: will check it out
[01:56] pauls1: rohitcolinrao: made by substack, he has a bunch of good node modules
[01:56] cmr: andrew12: (Plus possible fees)
[01:56] rohitcolinrao: yeah heard of that guy
[01:56] andrew12: hm... you guys are supposed to be good at javascript, right? how do i search through a string like ruby's String#search?
[01:56] rohitcolinrao: ok 
[01:56] andrew12: or at least, what is the best way?
[01:57] TheJH: andrew12, are you searching for a string or a regex?
[01:57] andrew12: regex
[01:57] pauls1: andrew12: i don't know ruby but maybe you can use regex
[01:57] TheJH: andrew12, regex.exec(str)
[01:57] TheJH: .. 1
[01:57] catb0t:  1
[01:57] andrew12: pauls1: I am using a regex, lol. ruby's String#search returns an array of where it matches it
[01:57] cmr: TheJH: Or, str.search(regex) ?
[01:57] TheJH: .. /ab/.exec("0ab00ab0")
[01:57] catb0t:  [ "ab", index: 1, input: "0ab00ab0" ]
[01:57] andrew12: cmr: that just returns where it matches
[01:58] TheJH: .. /.b/.exec("0ab00ab0")
[01:58] catb0t:  [ "ab", index: 1, input: "0ab00ab0" ]
[01:58] andrew12: see, that only returns the first match. i want ALL of the matches.
[01:58] GJdan: I'm sure I'll find this out the hard way in a bit, but when I find a node webserver to a port do I have to point the port to the host computer with my router?
[01:58] andrew12: do i just have to keep doing it repeatedly until it returns -1?
[01:58] pauls1: anyone know mongoose?
[01:59] GJdan: find=bind
[01:59] TheJH: .. "0ab00ab0".replace(/.b/g, function(){console.log(arguments)})
[01:59] catb0t:  Exception: ReferenceError: console is not defined
[01:59] pauls1: specificaly if there's some issue with updating an embedded doc?

[02:00] eastc: why not? :/
[02:00] rohitcolinrao: what issues where you talking about that now.js has, btw?
[02:00] TheJH: eastc, ok, first thing, I told them about a single-message DoS 23 days ago, they're still working on it
[02:00] eastc: so it's not secure
[02:01] eastc: basically
[02:01] TheJH: eastc, second thing, the browser side of their magic box polls an entire object structure for changes every second
[02:01] eastc: so it's not efficient
[02:01] TheJH: that gives you ~0.5s delay for changes of the magic box int he browser
[02:01] rohitcolinrao: you've worked with dnode then?
[02:01] pauls1: lol
[02:01] eastc: vs regula rjson i assume
[02:01] eastc: regular json*
[02:02] TheJH: eastc, to be fair, I have to say that server-side changes don't get propagated via polling

[02:03] kliff has joined the channel
[02:03] TheJH: rohitcolinrao, although it also has some issues... basically, it's impossible to automatically GC callbacks that the nodejs server sends to the browser
[02:03] rohitcolinrao: so it's possible to call server functions from the client(browser) and vice versa?
[02:04] TheJH: rohitcolinrao, yes
[02:04] rohitcolinrao: ah
[02:04] eastc: is there any alternative to now.js instead of doing it the normal way
[02:04] rohitcolinrao: any thoughts on socket stream?
[02:04] TheJH: eastc, dnode
[02:04] TheJH: rohitcolinrao, don't know what that is
[02:05] eastc: TheJH: and it works better to?
[02:05] eastc: or similarly
[02:05] TheJH: eastc, well, it works, and when I found a security-critical issue in it, substack released a fixed version on npm within 15 minutes or so
[02:05] rohitcolinrao: found this article about using socket stream (rt framework) http://addyosmani.com/blog/building-real-time-coffeescript-web-applications-with-socketstream/
[02:06] eastc: will go with dnode then :D
[02:06] rohitcolinrao: ryah: i submitted a late late late submission to sxsw interactive to do a talk on realtime apps with node ;)
[02:07] TheJH: rohitcolinrao, uh, a fat framework. for json over the net, you can use socket.io (dnode and nowjs use socket.io under the hood, too)
[02:07] rohitcolinrao: yeah
[02:08] TheJH: rohitcolinrao, socket.io can use websockets, and it has many fallbacks: flashsockets, forever iframes, xhr, jsonp, ...
[02:08] tjholowaychuk: coffeescript is essential to realtime
[02:08] Lingerance: ...
[02:08] TheJH: tjholowaychuk, totally :D
[02:08] eastc: i still need to npm install socket.io in order to use dnode right? or will it automatically install it's dependencies on its own?
[02:08] TheJH: eastc, npm is smart enough for that
[02:08] Lingerance: Oh that was sarcasm, k.
[02:08] jesusabdullah: Yeah dude, everyone knows that parens and brackets slow everything down
[02:08] jesusabdullah: That's why coffeescript does TWT
[02:09] jesusabdullah: for speed
[02:09] cmr: Yeah, and ->'s make it MUCH more streamlined.
[02:09] rohitcolinrao: yeah exactly, i was just wondering if there was an abstraction of sorts that made socket.io easy to implement for browser/server rt apps
[02:09] Sorella: Oh shit, no wonder Lisp is so slow.
[02:09] jesusabdullah: Oh yeah, I mean, they even point to the right
[02:09] cmr: Just look at that ->, it's aerodynamic.
[02:09] jesusabdullah: -> is computer code for "GO FAST OKAY"
[02:09] rohitcolinrao: tjholowaychuk, erm, why do you say that about coffee script?
[02:09] jesusabdullah: Okay, I'll stop now. Sorry coffeescript fans

[02:10] Sorella: eastc, broken scoping rules, broken and ambiguous grammar, highly overloaded operators, etc. etc. etc.
[02:10] TheJH: Lingerance, you can always compile it to JS :P
[02:10] TheJH: Sorella, broken scoping? not in coco :D - same for grammar
[02:11] jesusabdullah: I don't think that coffeescript is inherently broken or anything, though it's not really my bag either
[02:11] Sorella: not that JS grammar isn't ambiguous, but CoffeeScript takes it to a whole new level :3
[02:11] eastc: i mean coffeescript is "supposedly supposed to make our lives easier when writing to javascript
[02:11] eastc: right?
[02:11] jesusabdullah: supposed to
[02:11] jesusabdullah: well
[02:11] jesusabdullah: sort of
[02:11] Sorella: TheJH, haven't tried Coco yet, but languages with huge core stuff aren't really my thing.
[02:11] jesusabdullah: See, when I first saw coffeescript it was this "crazy awesome experiment" that Jeremy was doing
[02:11] rohitcolinrao: ok, so next question, anyone at a comfortable level with development in socket.io yet?
[02:11] jesusabdullah: and it was really neat
[02:11] jesusabdullah: but then people started using it in production
[02:11] tjholowaychuk: crazy experiment that is just like 50 others
[02:11] jesusabdullah: and I had to scratch my head a little bit
[02:11] tjholowaychuk: but it makes realtime
[02:12] tjholowaychuk: zoom zoom
[02:12] jesusabdullah: As a project, I really do think cs is cool.
[02:12] Sorella: jesusabdullah, why?
[02:12] Sorella: There's nothing really interesting in CS, besides a mashup of features from Python and Ruby.
[02:13] jesusabdullah: What's not to love, Sorella?
[02:13] Sorella: (We don't even get to use any function as an infix operator)
[02:13] Sorella: jesusabdullah, the grammar is terrible.
[02:13] jocafa: I got tired of debugging code that I didn't write
[02:13] jesusabdullah: Sorella: Imagine if coffeescript wasn't something people actually used.
[02:13] jesusabdullah: Imagine that there weren't 100 copycats
[02:13] tjholowaychuk: if it's ambigious to your parser it's ambigious to your eyes
[02:14] jesusabdullah: I like most "I made my own language" projects
[02:14] jesusabdullah: and I think that coffeescript did a pretty good job at that
[02:14] tjholowaychuk: it's a good experience
[02:14] tjholowaychuk: even if it's not really much of a language
[02:14] Sorella: CoffeeScript features *are* interesting if you take each one individually. But the way they were put together is just...
[02:15] jesusabdullah: It was able to keep around most of the things I like about javascript, implemented TWT without sacrificing anonymous functions like python did
[02:15] jesusabdullah: added some pretty neat sugar
[02:15] TheJH: !admin eval commands.admin.ceval = function(message, code, reply) {code=code.join(' ');try{eval(coco.compile(code, {bare:true}))}catch(e){}}

[02:16] TheJH: !admin ceval 1+1
[02:16] jhbot: 2
[02:16] TheJH: :)
[02:16] jesusabdullah: Basically, I wouldn't develop anything in it I actually wanted to show to other people
[02:16] jesusabdullah: because other people know javascript
[02:16] jesusabdullah: It's the lingua franca
[02:16] eastc: i agree
[02:16] jesusabdullah: It'd be like insisting on speaking Esparanto in Iowa
[02:17] TheJH: !admin ceval coco={}; coco<<<{cool:true, author: \satyr}; JSON.stringify coco
[02:17] jhbot: {"cool":true,"author":"satyr"}
[02:17] cmr: I don't know enough about cs to comment in-depth, but I can say I think the syntax is ugly and I see no real use for it.
[02:17] jesusabdullah: Honestly, cmr, that basically sums it up
[02:17] tjholowaychuk: i just find it funny that you're a troll if you say something negative about it
[02:18] jesusabdullah: coffeescript did teach me about the limitations of TWT
[02:18] tjholowaychuk: it is after-all subjective
[02:18] jesusabdullah: I was a python guy previously
[02:18] jesusabdullah: but you don't do the same things in python that you can in js
[02:18] Sorella: jesusabdullah, what would those be?
[02:18] jesusabdullah: like, multi-line lambdas
[02:18] cmr: I was also a python guy.
[02:18] Sorella: Because, well, Haskell also has semantic whitespace, iirc
[02:18] cmr: And while I really like python still, I like javascript even more.
[02:18] jesusabdullah: Basically, for me it gets confusing
[02:19] cmr: I'm excited for ES6 and beyond.
[02:19] cmr: Lots of nice things stolen from python.
[02:19] jesusabdullah: I prefer to make it more obvious with parens and brackets
[02:19] jocafa: I should never have to debug whitespace.
[02:19] jesusabdullah: A part of me still likes python, but I also know I'd hate webdev in python
[02:19] jesusabdullah: jocafa: Exactly.
[02:19] jesusabdullah: python's restrictive enough that you usually don't have to
[02:19] cmr: I've never had a problem with whitespace.
[02:19] jesusabdullah: but for something more freestyle like javascript you need more imo
[02:20] jesusabdullah: cmr: I never did in python either
[02:20] cmr: I had problems with confusing my loop variables, but I've done that in all the languages I've used :P
[02:20] cmr: Eugh worst bug ever is confusing j for i.
[02:20] jesusabdullah: cmr: Imagine if you could put a full def in the space you'd normally throw a lambda
[02:20] jesusabdullah: cmr: Also imagine that parens around function calls were optional and that the "in-thing" to do was to drop them unless necessary
[02:21] cmr: jesusabdullah: I like my parens thank you.
[02:21] jesusabdullah: cmr: i is for rows, j is for columns
[02:21] jesusabdullah: cmr: Yeah, me too. XD
[02:21] cmr: And my semicolons, and my curly braces.

[02:31] josephg: I should make it resize / scale properly
[02:31] andrew12: I heard chipmunk is pretty good
[02:31] josephg: yeah - its nice.
[02:31] tjholowaychuk: chipmunk is sweet
[02:31] josephg: sweet and, now in javascript!
[02:31] tjholowaychuk: nice :D
[02:31] andrew12: indeed
[02:31] tjholowaychuk: repo?

[02:32] josephg: hand port
[02:32] tjholowaychuk: wicked
[02:32] tjholowaychuk: the box2d ports suck so bad
[02:32] josephg: haha damn.
[02:32] josephg: I want to port the chipmunk demos next
[02:32] andrew12: tab1293: try this: https://gist.github.com/334ec5abe51c80dadc8c
[02:33] josephg: I don't have all the joints implemented yet either - but I have all the infrastructure in place, so they should be pretty easy
[02:33] tab1293: andrew12, i figured it out it was supposed to be 'sockets' not 'socket'
[02:33] andrew12: tab1293: right, that's exactly what I changed :P
[02:33] andrew12: plus I got rid of the on 'connection' bit since you don't need that, you just need to send somethng

[02:36] tjholowaychuk: fomatin sure what is it? or feel free to hop in #express
[02:36] andrew12: well I have a 20" that i could plug in but the stupid mini-displayport to dvi thing i have isn't working
[02:36] fomatin: sure
[02:37] Wa: has usage of node-inspector change / does it even work anymore? I notice all of their documentation seems out of date (eg. node --debug instead of node debug; http://127.0.0.1 when the program itself says http://0.0.0.0) Either way my kicking it isn't effective :(
[02:37] tab1293: andrew12, haha ok thank you. maybe you can answer this question my sockets are transfering the data but i have to refresh my page everytime i want an updated version of whats being transmitted. how can i make it realtime without refreshes?
[02:37] Wa: changed*
[02:37] andrew12: tab1293: try using the code i pasted
[02:37] andrew12: tab1293: your version waits until there's a connection and then sends it

[02:47] hotroot: I'm looking for node.js jobs around here, and I keep seeing stuff like "skills we're looking for: node.js, ror, PHP, redis, MySQL" etc. Are they just incompetent or do many places actually use like 4 different serverside languages?

[02:49] rwaldron has joined the channel
[02:49] andrew12: hotroot: it's more like they have no idea what they want.
[02:49] GrizzLyCRO: its probably how they evolved over time

[02:49] GrizzLyCRO: they started with PHP, then moved to ruby/java/python/whatever
[02:49] eastc has joined the channel
[02:49] andrew12: i wish i could easily find a job i could do from home as a teenager.
[02:49] GrizzLyCRO: and now they are starting to use node.js
[02:50] GrizzLyCRO: andrew12: you can
[02:50] hotroot: I'm just hoping that me refusing to learn a bunch of other languages isn't going to prevent me from getting a decent job
[02:50] andrew12: orly?
[02:50] GrizzLyCRO: yeah, do a couple of open source projects
[02:50] GrizzLyCRO: so you have portfolio
[02:50] andrew12: can i get paid for open source projects? :p
[02:50] GrizzLyCRO: you can, but you creat for example open source game
[02:50] hotroot: That's what I'm doing right now, writing my telnet hacking game so I can show it off when it's finished

[02:51] secoif: GrizzLyCRO that's pretty much exactly what i did
[02:52] secoif: the game didn't even work
[02:52] hotroot: lol
[02:52] andrew12: my github profile is pretty good proof of that
[02:52] secoif: in fact it wasn't even a game
[02:52] secoif: it was kind of
[02:52] secoif: a thing that was happening.
[02:52] cmr: My github profile needs to be wiped clean. I have crap code from when I was 14 on there.
[02:52] hotroot: My github profile has one poorly written browser game I've put about 2 hours into so far =P
[02:52] cmr: I think I'll do that now.

[02:54] Wa: well you added the wget~
[02:54] bambanx: thanks very much guys =)
[02:54] andrew12: and got rid of sudo :p
[02:54] Wa: x3
[02:54] hotroot: GrizzLyCRO: Yeah, that's why I'm spending a lot of time right now on this telnet game
[02:54] hotroot: Hoping it will be good enough
[02:54] GrizzLyCRO: good luck
[02:55] hotroot: Ty
[02:55] andrew12: it might be scary to people when you ask for a job and say "i wrote a telnet hacking game!!!11"
[02:55] hotroot: I don't think so
[02:55] andrew12: well if they don't know half a shit about computers :p
[02:55] GrizzLyCRO: and anyways, companies requiring other technologies (java/php/ruby/.net) in 99% that is because they have projects in these langs that they need to maintain
[02:55] hotroot: They would say, can you show us any work you've done? And I would say yep, I wrote a gameserver in node, and I would show them the code
[02:56] andrew12: ah
[02:56] Wa: one thing doesn't make much of a profile
[02:56] Wa: but it's a start~
[02:56] hotroot: I have two I
[02:56] hotroot: 'm working on
[02:56] GrizzLyCRO: and if you have good enough portfolio with only node.js and database stuff, you can say i am pro in node.js and i dont want to maintain .NET and JAVA apps for rest of my life :)
[02:56] cmr: A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
[02:56] andrew12: yeah. write a library that makes writing a telnet server super easy or something
[02:56] andrew12: lol
[02:57] andrew12: or.. write your game first then separate the bits of it out into separate projects.. that way you have many projects?
[02:57] andrew12: ACTION throwing ideas
[02:57] hotroot: GrizzLyCRO: You'd have to shoot me before I did .NET stuff =P
[02:57] GrizzLyCRO: hotroot: i know that feeling :)
[02:57] GrizzLyCRO: at my old job they tried to push me to maintain old .NET project
[02:58] hotroot: Sucks =/
[02:58] GrizzLyCRO: and i was all python guy
[02:58] GrizzLyCRO: i simply said NO
[02:58] hotroot: andrew12: Yeah, I could put my telnet stuff into a library
[02:58] GrizzLyCRO: they hired someone else to maintain old .NET stuff while i remade them in python :)
[02:59] hotroot: Nice =)
[02:59] cmr: Is node-inspector the best choice for debugger? I really hate dragging chrome around just for a debugger.
[02:59] bambanx: i am curios about node, node is good for apps like a cms? 
[02:59] hotroot: I like Python, or at least what I've seen of it. Probably going to learn it soon as my general language
[02:59] bambanx: with database
[02:59] andrew12: i just saw this: https://github.com/joyent/node-panic
[02:59] AAA_awright: cmr: You should be using chrome anyways
[03:00] andrew12: console.log() is often perfect debugging
[03:00] cmr: AAA_awright: Chrome doesn't have pentadactyl or anything even comparable in quality.
[03:00] andrew12: at least for me :P
[03:00] hotroot: bambanx: You're going to get biased answers in a node chat most likely, but I think it's pretty good for any web stuff
[03:00] hotroot: console.log ftw =P
[03:00] bambanx: thanks hotroot 
[03:01] andrew12: just use a decent logger like winston and debug everything
[03:01] AAA_awright: cmr: I've never even heard of that or know why would need it
[03:03] cmr: AAA_awright: it is essential to my Browsing Experience (TM)
[03:03] hotroot: AAA_awright: It's a dinosaur
[03:03] AAA_awright: Remember when Firefox was fast and the cool kid in town?
[03:04] hotroot: ^^
[03:04] tjfontaine: and it was called phoenix
[03:04] tjfontaine: and then firebird
[03:04] AAA_awright: And it was called Mozilla and came with a mail client and IRC client?
[03:05] AAA_awright: And fancy splash banner
[03:05] andrew12: ahhhh splash screens
[03:05] AAA_awright: I just pulled firefox up and I can't believe I held out switching to Chrome for as long as I did... that was like 2 years ago too
[03:05] andrew12: i switched to chrome immediately
[03:05] cmr: I switched when 13 was the dev version, whenever that was.
[03:06] AAA_awright: 8.x or so, I began compileing chromium on this Gentoo box
[03:06] AAA_awright: That's the only thing I can't stand, what do the stupid numbers mean
[03:06] hotroot: I can't remember when I switched to chrome
[03:06] cmr: AAA_awright: they mark lengths of time.
[03:07] AAA_awright: http://semver.org/ is the only way to number it, folks (ryah you listening?)

[03:24] andrew12: AAA_awright: it's worth noting that it's not yet hit major-version-zero
[03:24] andrew12: er,
[03:24] andrew12: it's still major-version-zero
[03:25] ryah: AAA_awright: i agree that it's not so useful
[03:25] ryah: but it's what we're using
[03:25] AAA_awright: andrew12: Which itself is bending the rules a bit. There's no reason you can't start at 1 and continue to increment when you break reverse compatability.
[03:25] tokuzfunpi has joined the channel
[03:25] andrew12: wait... if there's stable releases then it should already be 1.0! "Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable."
[03:25] ryah: s/so useful/the best/

[03:27] AAA_awright: If you don't perfectly follow it, that's a bugfix release, and you increment minor
[03:28] ryah: we're probably going to be following chrome/v8's scheme soon
[03:28] tjholowaychuk: it's a nice hint as to what changed
[03:28] c4milo: ryah: how come?
[03:28] AAA_awright: ... Like, use the v8 release numbers?
[03:28] tjholowaychuk: but at the same time, if it's patch-level you'll want to update
[03:28] tjholowaychuk: if it's minor you might have some fixes in there
[03:28] AAA_awright: Or use their date-based scheme? Neither is a good idea
[03:28] ryah: because i like the idea of time based releases
[03:28] andrew12: ryah: on the topic of versioning.. is there any particular reason why node isn't 1.0 yet?
[03:28] AAA_awright: That says absolutely nothing about compatibility with other programs though
[03:28] ryah: andrew12: because we're not done yet
[03:29] andrew12: i see
[03:29] AAA_awright: Just use a single field and increment, or use Git numbers
[03:29] tjholowaychuk: timestamps would be awkward
[03:29] andrew12: no, use increasing digits of pi

[03:30] AAA_awright: At least then, if you used Git commit IDs, it would at least point to a particular commit instead of just being "Hey release 9 came after 8"
[03:30] cmr: Why not have two version numbers... an "API compatability" number, and a "version 12" that is features or whatever.
[03:30] c4milo: it also is pretty similar to the OSGi versioning 
[03:30] AAA_awright: cmr: That sounds like http://semver.org/
[03:30] ryah: mostly i just want to be in-sync with V8
[03:30] jesusabdullah: andrew12: TeX does that right?
[03:30] cmr: AAA_awright: No way!?
[03:30] jesusabdullah: The pi thing, I mean
[03:30] c4milo: AAA_awright: a tag points to a specific commit 
[03:30] cmr: jesusabdullah: Yeah, either that or e
[03:30] ryah: so that we have a major node release for each V8
[03:31] AAA_awright: c4milo: Right, let's get rid of the extra name->commit map and just talk about commits directly
[03:31] ryah: forcing 6 week release cycles makes you do development differently
[03:31] AAA_awright: If you're going to ONLY use a single number
[03:31] jesusabdullah: That sounds terrible
[03:31] cmr: AAA_awright: Commits are a lot less memorable than names.
[03:31] AAA_awright: (or something equivelant like year.month)

[03:32] c4milo: jesusabdullah: indeed 
[03:32] AAA_awright: jesusabdullah: Well it's worse than semver, but my argument is it's no worse than a single field version, v9, v10, etc
[03:32] jesusabdullah: also at least I can remember "0.6.x" or "Ornery Octocat" or whatever

[03:33] jesusabdullah: ornery.
[03:33] c4milo: horny? 
[03:33] AAA_awright: It's really not hard guys, reverse incompatibility -> increment major, new feature that someone could depend on to make a release -> increment minor, bugfix -> increment patch
[03:33] jesusabdullah: definefor.me/ornery
[03:34] ryah: http://blog.chromium.org/2010/07/release-early-release-often.html good read
[03:34] c4milo: AAA_awright: that's semver yes 
[03:34] ryah: version numbers are not so important - releasing all the time is :)
[03:34] AAA_awright: And I don't see how that's incompatible with ryah's desire to have short release cycles
[03:35] hotroot has left the channel
[03:35] hotroot has joined the channel
[03:35] tjholowaychuk: yeah i dont get it
[03:35] tjholowaychuk: not sure how n.n.n gets in the way of that
[03:35] tjholowaychuk: i have stylus 0.21.x
[03:35] tjholowaychuk: it's a big number but who cares
[03:35] AAA_awright: Or rather, what problem it would pose. Not having the semantic revisions would be a problem, if anything, because now there's no way to say "we need major 2 and features in minor>=16"
[03:35] c4milo: ryah: yeah, versioning doesn't have to be with release early and often tho. I understand the desire of pairing with v8;. 
[03:36] ryah: tjholowaychuk: api changes don't fit cleanly into 6 week windows
[03:36] c4milo: has to do* 
[03:36] AAA_awright: "And oh yeah release 2.16.1 has a bug that accidently broke reverse compatibility, so not that one"
[03:36] tjholowaychuk: ryah so the goal is to break compat?
[03:36] ryah: the goal is to release often and early
[03:36] andrew12: "'twas the last build before christmas and all through the house, no keyboards were clicking nor even a mouse"
[03:37] tjholowaychuk: i definitely get the importance of just "plowing through" with the new
[03:37] tjholowaychuk: but it's tough to keep up
[03:37] tjholowaychuk: we still haven't migrated from 0.4.x
[03:37] c4milo: tjholowaychuk: the goal is to progress in small chunks, to make it appear faster and  it also gives more visibility 
[03:37] cmr: I think version numbers are personal preference and there will never been agreement on which is 'best'.
[03:38] cmr: (Even though semver is clearly the best ;)
[03:38] c4milo: tjholowaychuk: have you ever read the lean startup? 
[03:38] ryah: look - as much as everyone would like to believe you have control over your interfaces you dont
[03:38] ryah: v0.6 has API changes - socket.write now throws if it was closed
[03:38] ryah: bug fixes are api changes
[03:38] tjholowaychuk: ryah for sure, I break things just as much as the next person, the version is just a nice indication
[03:38] ryah: it's *very* subjective
[03:38] tjholowaychuk: personally I dont care if the version number is huge
[03:39] tjholowaychuk: but at least it gives you some idea
[03:39] AAA_awright: Chrome and OSes might be able to get away with a single-field revisions because it's just a way of saying "Hey, this is the next release after that previous one". For libraries like Node.js it's pretty critical I can say "Yep, this uses Node.js major revision 3 API, and features in 3.2, so you need at least 3.2.0"
[03:39] ryah: i think API just shouldn't change - ever
[03:39] jetienne has joined the channel
[03:39] ryah: semver seems to suggest that API changes are acceptable
[03:40] Lorentz: Just don't do what enlightenment does, with 0.16.999.66246

[03:41] AAA_awright: Some /. post suggested we need new programming languages to expose the latest new features... But that's rediculous, that means you need to assemble a new community of devepopers to develop the language. Why not use an existing community to develop it? And then why not just call it ProgrammingLanguage 2?
[03:41] ryah: every API change is a failure - and it should be gradual
[03:41] ryah: not come in huge chunks
[03:41] ryah: no python 3000

[03:42] ryah: but that's good

[03:43] jetienne: autoupdate ?
[03:43] socketio\test\40 has joined the channel
[03:43] AAA_awright: semver explicitly suggests you don't take breaking reverse compatibility lightly
[03:43] ryah: no autoupdate
[03:43] cmr: Honestly I think semver is crap because encoding that much information into a single number is stupid.
[03:43] AAA_awright: But we've got to know if there is even a single feature that's pulled from a future release, that it's going to be incompatible
[03:43] tjholowaychuk: it's just a hint
[03:43] andrew12: cmr: it's 3 numbers though
[03:44] dr0id has joined the channel
[03:44] cmr: andrew12: Nah, it's one number in a as-of-yet unnamed number system ;)
[03:44] ryah: imcompatible is emotional and subjective
[03:44] sstreza has left the channel
[03:44] ryah: the word "incompatible" that is
[03:44] andrew12: i wonder who started the whole versioning.numbers.with.a.ton.of.dots
[03:44] AAA_awright: My favorite program to hate is Blender: they have this 2.xx numbering scheme which I completely fail to understand, and the developers say they won't increment that 2 even though CLEARLY 2.50 breaks reverse compatibility with all sorts of things from particle physics to the UI to plugins. But it still works for "most" .blend files.
[03:45] AAA_awright: So, no major increment.
[03:45] AAA_awright: ACTION headdesk
[03:45] andrew12: they don't have an API though.
[03:45] AAA_awright: Yeah they do.
[03:45] cmr: andrew12: Yes they do.
[03:45] cmr: The python api is extensive.
[03:45] andrew12: how does a GUI have an API?
[03:45] andrew12: that's different
[03:45] AAA_awright: The UI is written in Python, too.
[03:45] AAA_awright: ACTION headdesk
[03:45] andrew12: that doesn't matter... the UI isn't the API :|
[03:45] AAA_awright: I've been a long time proponent of them switching to Javascript
[03:46] AAA_awright: Hasn't picked up much traction.
[03:46] ryah: i think it would major more sense to label certain APIs with stability
[03:46] ryah: like is done in solaris
[03:46] ryah: s/major/make
[03:46] ryah: than rely on versions
[03:46] ryah: i mean if you're going for usefulness
[03:46] Lorentz: heh, version the apis?
[03:47] AAA_awright: andrew12: My biggest point is 2.50 can't fully load files from 2.49x, if it uses features like physics or the python API
[03:47] AAA_awright: But it can somewhat, so that somehow doesn't break reverse compatibility.
[03:47] ryah: Lorentz: yes
[03:47] ismell_ has joined the channel
[03:47] AAA_awright: Node.js needs to avoid this at all costs.
[03:47] ryah: for example, node's http.createServer API is damn stable
[03:47] ryah: it will never chnge
[03:47] ryah: but cluster.fork is not stable
[03:48] tonymilne has left the channel
[03:48] AAA_awright: I wouldn't say there's no better way it could be implemented but it does look pretty nice
[03:48] cmr: ryah: so versioning each module?
[03:48] ryah: no - each function
[03:48] AAA_awright: That's another option.
[03:48] AAA_awright: That's too much.
[03:48] cmr: I like that.
[03:48] tjholowaychuk: sounds like css prefixes
[03:49] AAA_awright: I imagine functions like http.createServer_2 at worst. No. Just, no.
[03:49] ryah: see this: http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19082-01/819-3620/chp-stab-1/index.html
[03:49] kerigan_ has joined the channel
[03:49] andrew12: versioning each function sounds like an interesting idea

[03:51] Arke has joined the channel
[03:52] AAA_awright: cmr: The only use a single-field version has is to say 11>10, but you can already do that with v0.8.1>v0.8.0

[03:52] ryah: it's just something for the docs

[03:54] ryah: i think it would be reasonable for Node to commit to certain APIs at this point
[03:54] cmr: AAA_awright: I was thinking "node 11" > "node 12" be a time-based thing, but 0.8.0 to 0.8.1 be an API thing.
[03:54] yzhang_: hi, does anyone successfully compile node.js on arm?
[03:54] ryah: e.g. setTimeout, process.version, process.nextTick
[03:54] ryah: yzhang_: yes, some have
[03:55] windsurf_: anyone know how I can overcome this socket.io error? I don't know if there's some jsonp thing i was supposed to configure. Error: Origin http://foo.local is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. My node app is at http://foo.nodejitsu.com
[03:55] AAA_awright: Usually functions don't change by themselves... they change within the context of a module. If you have to eliminate a function, version numbers don't help you there.
[03:56] AAA_awright: Like the great sys->util rename
[03:56] cmr: AAA_awright: Well, to use ryah's example, socket.write's exception throwing chaning.
[03:56] cmr: That's an API change.
[03:56] cmr: But not the entire module.
[03:57] ryah: we're probably going to end up wrapping V8's header in order to provide a stable ABI
[03:57] ryah: which is annoying - but necessary
[03:58] ryah: at the moment we don't (and can't) guarantee stable ABI between major node versions
[03:58] yzhang_: @ryah, do you have the details?

[04:38] andrew12: hotroot: https://github.com/hookio/hook.io
[04:38] hotroot: Yeah, look at the top
[04:39] andrew12: "a way to enable i/o for your node.js application"
[04:39] hotroot: Oh, hook.js -.-
[04:39] josephg: yeahâ€¦ no browser IO I think
[04:39] andrew12: :P
[04:40] hotroot: I should write a hook.io telnet library
[04:41] andrew12: hotroot: here's all the code for it: require('net')
[04:41] hotroot: If you want user input that shows up as a bunch of boxes, sure
[04:42] hotroot: And sends fun newlines and tab breaks every time it sends data
[04:42] hotroot: Plus there is a whole bunch of shit for getting terminal size, etc.

[05:00] c4milo has joined the channel
[05:00] andrew12: hotroot: most of the time people don't *need* globals because they're not writing something that's going to be used everywhere
[05:00] andrew12: I think that's the main idae
[05:00] andrew12: idea too
[05:01] hotroot: Well in my hacking game, the list of currently connected clients is a global
[05:01] andrew12: gasp
[05:01] systemfault: My god....
[05:01] systemfault: Educate yourselves
[05:01] systemfault: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GlobalVariablesAreBad
[05:01] systemfault: And for javascript.. there's another disadvantage.. they're slower.
[05:01] andrew12: they are?
[05:02] kenperkins has joined the channel
[05:03] systemfault: Yes. Because of the way scoping works in javascript..
[05:03] hotroot: Okay, how would my client list not be global?
[05:03] pauls1: anyone know how to use exec (child_process) to exec from within a specified directory?
[05:03] andrew12: var client_list
[05:03] andrew12: tada
[05:04] cmr: hotroot: Where do you need your client list?
[05:04] hotroot: Yes...and doing that makes it global
[05:04] andrew12: nope

[05:05] cmr: Yeah
[05:05] hotroot: Alright, well I'm fairly new to writing this stuff, I'll gist it. Not sure of how else I would really do this?
[05:05] secoif: hotroot read up on coupling and dependency injection
[05:05] systemfault: Hmm
[05:05] systemfault: Manual DI?
[05:06] secoif: systemfault manual di = passing parameters to constructor
[05:06] systemfault: (I don't know if node has a DI container)
[05:06] systemfault: secoif: Right.
[05:06] hotroot: https://gist.github.com/1513206
[05:07] andrew12: where's the global?
[05:07] secoif: hotroot you're not actually creating a global
[05:07] hotroot: 0.o
[05:07] hotroot: Err, global var != global?
[05:07] secoif: it's 'global' to that file.
[05:07] andrew12: there are no global vars there.
[05:08] hotroot: The first declared vars are global vars
[05:08] secoif: hotroot a global is a variable that is accessible to every file in the application. this is just oen file and none of those variables are global
[05:08] andrew12: nope, those are all locals. that's exactly what var means.

[05:09] andrew12: (userCommands)
[05:09] andrew12: orly?
[05:09] andrew12: what version of node?
[05:09] hotroot: maybe ./userCommands works, but I tried (userCommands) and nope
[05:09] andrew12: you have to have ./, yeah
[05:09] hotroot: Meh, it's fine
[05:09] andrew12: :p
[05:10] hotroot: Anyway, I'm trying to access ips from the userCommands
[05:10] hotroot: global.ips isn't working, I thought that was the way to do it?
[05:10] secoif: hotroot just pass 'ips' to it
[05:10] hotroot: Modules already have the scope?
[05:11] secoif: ?
[05:11] hotroot: Oh
[05:11] hotroot: Blegh, passing everything? =/
[05:11] davidbanham has joined the channel
[05:11] secoif: you could create an 'app' object that contains that stuff
[05:11] secoif: if it onyl needs to be shared with one or two other objects, it's fine
[05:11] hotroot: This is why I would do single file programs if nobody was against it =P
[05:12] secoif: hotroot read up on coupling and dependency injection
[05:12] hotroot: I read the wiki page on dependency injection, made no sense to me
[05:12] cmr: hotroot: So make it in a single file if you want to. Why let anybody else stop you?
[05:12] andrew12: single file programs are awesome

[05:15] jesusabdullah: production maybe
[05:15] jesusabdullah: Yeah
[05:15] hotroot: how do I do that? Just define var main = this; in the top of the main app?

[08:35] richardr: What is the best way to install Node.js on OS X? A method that makes it easy to upgrade/remove Node/NPM in the future.
[08:35] context: whats the site say
[08:35] context: that site i gave you, will tell you what version of node the package requires
[08:36] context: but you could be like most people and not take ANY help anyone gives you and continue to ask pointless questions.
[08:36] context: OR you could npm install it and try it out... and answered that question yourself about 5 minutes ago or longer
[08:36] context: like you said you were
[08:37] enzo: ok ok context, in fact, it's empty for Dependencies for uglify-js so 0.4.9 will be ok
[08:37] enzo: thanks for your help
[08:37] context: you really aren't going to start WW3 if it doesn't work. read less. do more. you tend to answer your own questions a lot quicker that way, instead of wasting your and everyone elses time

[10:30] darren: question about error handling in callbacks: seems that the usual style is callback(error, arg1, arg2) and the callback has to check for the presence of the error. Is there any problem with adding the error case as a property of the callback function eg: callback.error(err1, err2) on error and callback(happy1, happy2) on success?
[10:31] cmr: flamboz: You really can't, though. Not perfectly.
[10:31] robinduckett: darren: you'd have to supply a callback which was a instantiated class
[10:31] deoxxa: darren: makes passing in an anonymous callback kind of tricky
[10:31] robinduckett: darren: rather than a function
[10:31] deoxxa: robinduckett: what's a class
[10:32] robinduckett: deoxxa: well, there's blue collar, white collar, the lower class, upper middle class
[10:32] deoxxa: zing
[10:32] robinduckett: deoxxa: white anglo saxon protestants are usually in the upper middle class
[10:32] darren: argh, yes. could pass the anon. function to a factory to attach the callback first but yeah, ugly
[10:33] darren: just bugs me having the first arg be null in all happy path scenarios

[10:40] robinduckett: it evaluates it all before moving onto the next tick

[10:47] robinduckett: yeah, if the first scene of the movie includes the first takedown that wouldn't be fun for anyone
[10:47] robinduckett: i think they'd have to show some backstory of the buggers
[10:49] brutasse has left the channel
[10:49] cmr: robinduckett: So if I am understanding this correctly, node goes through, reads the *entire* program, then executes the 'toplevel' things. The next 'level' down would be their callbacks, and the boundary between when that happens is a tick?
[10:50] lwille has joined the channel
[10:50] robinduckett: cmr: that's a reasonable approximation. obviously if you have some kind of event running it will wait until they are triggered before going down the next level
[10:50] robinduckett: nodejs is pretty much inception
[10:50] eeemsi_: ^^
[10:51] robinduckett: think of it like browser javascript
[10:51] cmr: I really liked that movie. Very original. Had more potential than it filled.
[10:51] cmr: I honestly haven't done that much browser javascript.
[10:51] robinduckett: except instead of waiting for user interaction
[10:51] robinduckett: it waits for callbacks, events you may have listened for, etc
[10:51] robinduckett: hmm have you done any game programming?
[10:52] cmr: Some. Biggest experience with event loops is python's Twisted.

[14:54] sharkbird has joined the channel
[14:55] icebox has joined the channel
[14:55] sharkbird_ has joined the channel
[14:55] cuenca: npm install canvas didn't work because it seems Mac Snow Leopard has libjpeg-6.2 instead of libjpeg-8
[14:56] cuenca: so I downloaded it, patched it to make it work with libjpeg-6.2 and did:
[14:56] cuenca: node-waf configure build
[14:56] Lingerance: You have Python 2.6?
[14:56] cuenca: yes
[14:56] _unary has joined the channel
[14:57] cuenca: node-waf correctly (I think) generated build/Release/canvas.node
[14:57] cuenca: but I guess there must be an extra step to "install" this extension
[14:57] cuenca: if I run node
[14:57] cuenca: and I do:
[14:57] cuenca: require('canvas');
[14:58] cuenca: I get: Error: Cannot find module 'canvas'
[14:58] cuenca: anybody knows if there is something else to do after node-waf configure build?
[14:58] Lingerance: Do you have a node_modules in the current directory?
[14:59] Lingerance: ... and is there a canvas directory, or a canvas.js/canvas.node in it?
[15:01] cuenca: Lingerance: I don't have a node_modules in the current directory, but I do have one in /Users/cuenca (I'm in /Users/cuenca/projects/node-canvas)
[15:01] cuenca: Lingerance: ls build/Release/
[15:01] cuenca: gives: canvas.node src
[15:02] Lingerance: node.js looks for modules in ./node_modules
[15:02] Lingerance: ... and a compile-time-configuration-specific global location
[15:02] cuenca: I tried copying canvas.node into /Users/cuenca/node_modules
[15:03] cuenca: and it gave a different error:
[15:03] cuenca: Error: Unable to load shared library /Users/cuenca/node_modules/canvas.node
[15:03] Lingerance: Then it didn't compile right
[15:03] dscape: cuenca: 
[15:03] dscape: npm install node-canvas
[15:04] dscape: not npm install -g node-canvas
[15:04] cuenca: dscape: yeah, I wish. I tried that and it didn't work
[15:04] cuenca: dscape: node-canvas depends on libjpeg-8
[15:04] dscape: don't know if that's your problem but I remember having an issue like that in my first or second day working with node
[15:04] cuenca: and in my Mac I have libjpeg-6.2
[15:04] dscape: cuenca: then its not a nodejs question anymore :)
[15:04] cuenca: I patched it using: https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas/pull/123
[15:05] dr0id has left the channel
[15:05] dscape: would love to help but have no idea what that is
[15:05] cuenca: dscape: if you can confirm that to use a nodejs I only need to use node-waf build configure
[15:05] icebox: cuenca: anyway it should be copied to /Users/cuenca/node_modules/canvas/build/Release/canvas.node
[15:05] cuenca: icebox: thanks, will try to copy it there
[15:06] cuenca: but my question is more nodejs specific, in general is there anything else to do to install a module after node-waf build configure?
[15:06] cuenca: am I supposed to copy the resulting files somewhere?

[15:09] cuenca: Lingerance: so if I want to install a random module from github that's not available in npm in theory I only have to run node-waf?
[15:09] Lingerance: No.
[15:09] stagas has joined the channel
[15:09] cuenca: sorry if the questions are a bit stupid :-( as I said, it's my first time with node.js

[15:10] Lingerance: If there's a package.json go into the directory and just "npm install"
[15:10] TheJH: "Filesystem in Use..." BWAHAHA
[15:10] cuenca: Lingerance: there is a package.json, but can I ask npm to install something that I downloaded in my local hard drive?
[15:10] Lingerance: Does anyone sane even use sourceforge anymore?
[15:11] CarterL has joined the channel
[15:11] Lingerance: Yes

[15:25] Brandon_R: which do you like more. the custom built one or mac
[15:25] danraz_: anyone doing A/B Testing in node?
[15:26] _Steve_: Brandon_R: depends on what I'm doing; my workstation has 2 screens which is nice when reading a manual + coding

[15:31] Brandon_R: let me check
[15:32] _Steve_: Brandon_R: I wouldn't got for a mac osx86 (or whatever its called these days)
[15:32] _Steve_: Brandon_R: it might be that when you upgrade the OS itself (10.7 --> 10.7.1 e.g.) you break stuff
[15:32] _Steve_: apart from the effort of getting it installed (dispite being 'easy')
[15:33] _Steve_: then again, when you upgrade Ubuntu things will break as well ;)

[15:34] Brandon_R: memory has gotton pretty cheap over the years
[15:34] _Steve_: Brandon_R: yeah
[15:34] mmalecki: but OS X is the perfect balance. on Linux I found few things randomly fucked up - sound system, for example
[15:34] mmalecki: and windows? well, come on.
[15:34] _Steve_: mmalecki: depends on your hardware I guess
[15:34] MooGoo: meh...os x is not nearly as special as it was in the good ol days
[15:34] MooGoo: it doesnt even look that slick anymore imo
[15:34] ldn_tech_exec: you mean the neXT days?
[15:34] mmalecki: _Steve_: yeah, I guess so
[15:35] Brandon_R: on apple 1333MHz DDR3 ECC R-DIMM SDRAM vs custom bought 32GB (8 x 4GB) 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 1600
[15:35] MooGoo: I always had a thing for OS 9
[15:35] Brandon_R: not sure which is better
[15:35] MooGoo: dunno why
[15:35] MooGoo: considering how crap it was
[15:35] MooGoo: it has...
[15:35] context: brandon_r: define 'better' obviously the 1600mhz is
[15:36] context: its faster
[15:36] MooGoo: I spent way more for my 6gb of ddr3

[16:06] TheJH: is there anything for doing this weird FD passing magic in nodejs?
[16:06] ldn_tech_exec: i dont know what console stuff _Steve_ was talking about so....
[16:07] TheJH: suid process A opens a FD, passes it on to process B
[16:07] TheJH: where B is a nodejs process
[16:07] TheJH: is that possible?
[16:07] Brandon_R: does weechat have these join/exit notifications
[16:07] context: moogoo: what. whatching 5000 irccloud disconnects is awesome
[16:08] Dmitrijus: TheJH: if B is spawned by A, then yes
[16:09] TheJH: Dmitrijus, and if A is spawned by B?
[16:09] Brandon_R: is b linked by a?
[16:09] MooGoo: weechat has built in join/part hiding that works quite nicelly..
[16:09] Dmitrijus: TheJH: /me googling around :), but seems likely or would involve some ugly trickery
[16:09] TheJH: Brandon_R, linked by?
[16:09] Dmitrijus: unlikely*
[16:09] mike5w3c_ has joined the channel
[16:10] Brandon_R: in erlang b would be linked to a so if it dies a is notified
[16:10] nodebiscut has joined the channel
[16:10] Dmitrijus: Brandon_R: in erlang processes have a different meaning :)
[16:10] TheJH: Brandon_R, the scenario is that there's a SUID helper that can open a FD and my nodejs program spawns this helper and wants to get the FD in echange
[16:10] TheJH: *exchange
[16:11] Dmitrijus: TheJH: what kind of fd is it? 
[16:11] mmalecki: TheJH: yes

[16:20] Dmitrijus: TheJH: but the descriptors here are openened before spawning, not after :)
[16:21] TheJH: Dmitrijus, right - I figured this is probably going to work,t oo
[16:21] Dmitrijus: TheJH: you can also pass -C <fd> to sudo, since it closes everything not in 0,1,2

[16:23] kristoffer: I'll try installing all the development tools.
[16:23] Dmitrijus: TheJH: but what are you doing, going sudo seems bad
[16:24] TheJH: Dmitrijus, "mount" needs root rights
[16:25] Dmitrijus: TheJH: not really, gnome somehow manages to mount my usb drives (you could do something similar, )
[16:25] Dmitrijus: also autofs?
[16:26] TheJH: Dmitrijus, afaik, there's always some suid binary doing stuff in the background
[16:26] MooGoo: it's needed in a general case....you can config mountpoints to work for normal users
[16:26] TheJH: Dmitrijus, also, I don't want to mount a normal FS
[16:26] Lingerance: Dmitrijus: That's because a root-level program does that
[16:26] ismell has joined the channel
[16:26] Dmitrijus: Lingerance: well, my point exactly, he should use _that_ program :)
[16:27] Lingerance: TBH I find that program incredebly annoying
[16:27] TheJH: Dmitrijus, "-rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 85740 11. Jul 13:35 /bin/mount" - mount is suid
[16:27] mrryanjohnston has joined the channel
[16:27] kristoffer: I'm still getting the same "not found"s. Anyone know what "library dl, util, rt, and fdatasync(2)" is?
[16:27] Dmitrijus: TheJH: yes, to permit user mounts
[16:27] TheJH: kristoffer, did you try "yum install build-essential" or "yum install build-essentials" or so?
[16:28] kristoffer: TheJH, thanks I'll try them right now
[16:28] Lingerance: TheJH: can't you pass FDs with UNIX sockets?
[16:28] Dmitrijus: TheJH: so, what kind of fs is yours? :)
[16:29] TheJH: Dmitrijus, I'm playing around with fuse (just playing around, not sure whether I'll try to implement it)
[16:29] mmalecki: Dmitrijus: I think that GNOME talks to XOrg and Xorgs runs with root rights
[16:30] mmalecki: s/Xorgs/XOrg/
[16:30] Dmitrijus: madhums: yep
[16:30] Dmitrijus: mmalecki :)
[16:30] kristoffer: TheJH, it appears there are no build-essentials in Fedora. "Development Tools" is supposed to install everything needed for compiling
[16:30] Dmitrijus: TheJH: well, fuse can be mounted by non-priveleged-users, somehow
[16:31] TheJH: Dmitrijus, yes, by using fusermount, which is setuid root
[16:31] Lingerance: <mmalecki> Dmitrijus: I think that GNOME talks to XOrg and Xorgs runs with root rights <-- X doesn't do anything with mounting.
[16:31] Lingerance: It's a process gnome-vfs or similar
[16:31] TheJH: Dmitrijus, fusermount opens the device, calls mount with it and passes the FD back to the caller or something like that
[16:32] Dmitrijus: TheJH: hm,
[16:32] TheJH: mmalecki, Lingerance, "lsof /dev/fuse" -> "gvfs-fuse 1941 jann    3u   CHR 10,229      0t0 7298 /dev/fuse"
[16:32] TheJH: ah, wait, you're talking about the "real" mounting stuff
[16:32] TheJH: sorry
[16:33] Dmitrijus: .gvfs is not really related here

[16:36] ldn_tech_exec: MooGoo: how to install weechat with homebrew?
[16:36] trose: so what's the common practice for unit testing node/express servers?
[16:36] TheJH: Lingerance, to talk to the kernelspace fuse driver
[16:36] Dmitrijus: TheJH: you mean /dev/fuse?
[16:36] TheJH: kristoffer, I'm a fedora user
[16:36] TheJH: Dmitrijus, yes

[16:37] TheJH: kristoffer, no
[16:37] wilmoore has joined the channel
[16:37] Dmitrijus: TheJH: there is a "fuse" group just for that :)
[16:37] MooGoo: ldn_tech_exec: homebrew? what distro
[16:37] tjfontaine: yes, in debuntu the user needs to be a part of the fuse group
[16:37] TheJH: Dmitrijus, no, they can't mount, I'm pretty sure
[16:38] TheJH: Dmitrijus, that are just the people who can call fusermount
[16:38] kristoffer: TheJH, that is interesting, are you using fedora 16=
[16:38] ldn_tech_exec: MooGoo: im on osx
[16:38] tjfontaine: TheJH: no, for non-root mounts to work they need access to /dev/fuse which is ideally governed by your user group
[16:38] MooGoo: ah
[16:38] MooGoo: well...it's either packged up already, or you need to compile it
[16:38] TheJH: tjfontaine, hmm... let me play around with that...
[16:39] ldn_tech_exec: MooGoo: there's an install-sh , shall i run it?
[16:39] ldn_tech_exec: MooGoo: or use homebrew
[16:39] tjfontaine: TheJH: usermode -a -G fuse <user in question>
[16:39] MooGoo: uh
[16:39] tjfontaine: er
[16:39] MooGoo: I dunno....never done much on os x
[16:39] tjfontaine: usermod -a -G fuse <user in question>
[16:39] ldn_tech_exec: MooGoo: k thanks
[16:39] MooGoo: I'd say compile it if you can
[16:39] MooGoo: to get the latest dev version
[16:40] TheJH: tjfontaine, I don't even have that group on my system
[16:40] MooGoo: should be just make && make install
[16:40] MooGoo: ./configure !!
[16:40] MooGoo: or something
[16:40] TheJH: tjfontaine, is it even possible to determine other permissions than file access based on the group?
[16:40] tjfontaine: TheJH: ls -alh /dev/fuse
[16:41] TheJH: tjfontaine, "crw-rw-rw-. 1 root root 10, 229  1. Dez 18:05 /dev/fuse" - and no, "mount" fails (I can see that in strace) and sshfs falls back to fusermount
[16:42] tjfontaine: on a sane deubuntu system "crw-rw-rw- 1 root fuse 10, 229 2011-05-26 14:37 /dev/fuse"
[16:43] Brandon_R: hey guys

[16:43] Brandon_R: what is a good way to store socket connections?
[16:43] jstash: has anybody extended the node 0.6 Agent to do persistent connections (i.e. keep the connection alive even though there aren't any pending requests yet)?
[16:43] Brandon_R: like an array doesn't seem a scalable solution
[16:43] tjfontaine: Brandon_R: I keep mine in my shoe
[16:44] Brandon_R: it needs to be easily iteratable 
[16:44] ldn_tech_exec: MooGoo: ok figuring it out... this is not idiot friendly

[16:45] jstash: if array sucks, double-linked list
[16:45] Brandon_R: doubly linked list?
[16:46] Brandon_R: what is a socket connection really? just a string path to a stream like dev/sock/123?

[16:50] Brandon_R: tcp/ip
[16:50] context: websockets are still raw tcp/ip sockets
[16:50] purge: ndistro would download a arch version of node and stick it in ./bin/node

[17:55] FG has joined the channel

[17:57] eastc: from a static file

[18:02] mmalecki: some socket.io inspector, so that you could see packets flow

[20:38] jesusabdullah: trustworthiness is hard to measure

[20:39] jocafa: Safari, y u no have Function.prototype.bind?!
[20:39] mmalecki: teadict: :). this one is specific - it monkey-punches string
[20:40] rwaldron has joined the channel
[20:40] TheJH: mmalecki, why does marak like monkey-patching so much? :/
[20:41] teadict: I was about to ask if that meant something in particular
[20:41] mmalecki: TheJH: he doesn't monkey-patch. at nodejitsu, we monkey-punch.
[20:41] TheJH: teadict, it means that you change things outside of your module
[20:41] TheJH: teadict, you can e.g. alter the way the core API works
[20:41] mmalecki: TheJH: but really, it's pretty convenient
[20:41] TheJH: teadict, or you can enhance strings and numbers with additional methods
[20:41] mmalecki: yeah, messy, I know
[20:42] teadict: I see
[20:42] ldn_tech_exec_ has left the channel
[20:42] mmalecki: but this API is quite fun and easy to understand
[20:42] TheJH: mmalecki, until you require the module twice.

[23:20] marshall: context: why don't I want spaces in my event names?
[23:20] Sirwan: so no one out there has node on centos ?
[23:20] marshall: context: and I'd like to understand how to use eventemitter properly before I use a library
[23:20] QaDeS: has anyone here tried node.js on a sunfire yet?
[23:21] context: sirwan: thats funny. centos 6 doesn't have python 2.4
[23:21] andrew12: hmm
[23:21] MooGoo: man I mentioned this 12 hours ago
[23:21] MooGoo: it requires at least 2.5
[23:21] jesusabdullah: That's what I mean by stale, see?
[23:21] context: marshall: im not sure spaces in event names are allowed. ive never seen or ever heard it recommended. and .... you can always just TRY it
[23:21] jesusabdullah: python 2.4 is old enough that many libraries are no longer supporting it
[23:21] andrew12: is there any sort of way to do something like ruby's IO.pipe in node?
[23:22] jesusabdullah: and God forbid you get stuck with python 2.2
[23:22] Sirwan: MooGoo: node requires 2.5 at leasT?
[23:22] jesusabdullah: I think I know of maybe one python library that still supports 2.2
[23:22] MooGoo: conversly, on arch python3 is default
[23:22] context: sirwan: centos 6 has python 2.6. so you installed 2.4 manually or you are not running centos 6
[23:22] MooGoo: Sirwan: thats what the internets tell me
[23:22] andrew12: doesn't centos require 2.4
[23:22] briancray has joined the channel
[23:22] andrew12: heh
[23:22] context: centos doesn't even have 2.4 !
[23:22] MooGoo: 2.5 is too new and unstable for cent
[23:23] MooGoo: they are pushing it with 2.4
[23:23] context: why does the package list show 2.6
[23:23] Sirwan: so is that why im getting an error becuase i have 2.4
[23:23] jesusabdullah: probably
[23:23] MooGoo: python --version
[23:23] context: 5.7 has 2.4
[23:23] context: 6.0 has 2.6
[23:24] Sirwan: iv found this pagE:
[23:24] Sirwan: has differnt phucking instructions
[23:24] Sirwan: maybe UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS
[23:24] Sirwan: some thing some people try looking for 
[23:24] Sirwan: rather than a 2 foot API documentaiton on nodejs
[23:24] Sirwan: which has no bearing on the average user
[23:25] Sirwan:   Installing     : nodejs-stable-release                                    1/1   Installed:   nodejs-stable-release.noarch 0:5-3

[23:26] context: wow. 
[23:26] context: 'this page'
[23:26] context: again. please be more vague when talking to us
[23:26] Sirwan: how can i test whether node has been installed ?
[23:26] context: run the node command ?
[23:26] Sirwan: which is ?
[23:26] Sirwan: be more vague dude
[23:27] Sirwan: maybe ill get it
[23:27] context: 'node' ?
[23:27] context: THE *NODE* COMMAND
[23:27] Sirwan: it says commend not found
[23:27] Sirwan: after having just told me its been installed
[23:27] context: if thats vague ill try to be more...
[23:27] context: try running 'rehash'
[23:27] context: maybe if you didn't run such a PoS distro you wouldn't have so many problems
[23:27] kliff: Sirwan: you are the guy fitting on the #express channel the other day, right?
[23:28] kliff: fighting*

[23:28] Sirwan: im trying to get node working
[23:28] context: amen to that
[23:28] kliff: read about node
[23:28] Sirwan: i have
[23:28] kliff: someone shouldn't have to tell you to run the node command
[23:28] Sirwan: not much out there evidently
[23:28] context: did you follow ALL the instructions
[23:28] kliff: thats not true
[23:28] context: that yum localinstall is not the only command you need to run
[23:28] kliff: node has good docs
[23:29] context: maybe if you 'read' more and complained less stuff would work
[23:29] dilvie has joined the channel
[23:29] kliff: i can understand that maybe there is not stuff on centos etc
[23:29] Sirwan: so what OS would you recommend ?
[23:29] kliff: and thats ok
[23:29] kliff: but you should know a bit more about installing node
[23:29] kliff: on whatever machine you have
[23:29] context: debian, ubuntu, anything besides cent ?
[23:29] Sirwan: i have INSTALLED NODE ON MY MAC BEFORE
[23:29] Sirwan: cent sucks that bad ?
[23:30] kliff: i am on mac, i installed it on mac and so no one needs to tell me to run 'node'
[23:30] context: you tell us. you seem to be enjoying it
[23:30] Sirwan: i know about node you pratt
[23:30] Sirwan: im just saying its said its installed
[23:30] context: it took me about 30 seconds to get node running on ubuntu
[23:30] Sirwan: yet when i run node
[23:30] Sirwan: the command doesnt exist
[23:30] context: sirwan: did you run the second command yet
[23:30] Sirwan: which second command?
[23:30] Sirwan: you only gave me one *NODE*
[23:30] context: see
[23:30] context: did you read ?
[23:30] Sirwan: yes
[23:30] context: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager
[23:30] Sirwan: *NODE*
[23:31] context: scroll down to fedora/cent/etc
[23:31] context: i see TWO commands

[23:32] context: i use debian/ubuntu for servers
[23:32] Sirwan: therse what i got from installing that second command too: https://gist.github.com/1515673
[23:32] context: try nodejs -v
[23:33] TheFuzzball: I like Ubuntu headless, I also quite like Arch Linux
[23:33] context: learn how to use a damn terminal... nod <tab> <tab> will show you all commands that start with nod if any exist
[23:33] mmalecki: vagrant is a win
[23:33] Sirwan: ah ok no it says 0.0.6
[23:33] Sirwan: so how come node didnt work and nodejs -v did ?
[23:33] mmalecki: works on os x and linux, so if you need a sane os fast, it's definitely a good choice
[23:33] mmalecki: all headless and shit
[23:34] Sirwan: centos is one of the fastest os's
[23:34] context: sirwan: cause centos is a pile of shit that installed node as the command 'nodejs' and not 'node' like ALL other distros
[23:34] Sirwan: omg
[23:34] Sirwan: fuck
[23:34] mmalecki: centos *is* a pile of shit
[23:34] Sirwan: context: what os do you use ?
[23:34] Sirwan: whats the most common os for node ?
[23:34] context: sirwan: centos is linux. linux is linux. saying one distro is faster than anotehr is the dumbest thing ive heard all day
[23:34] mmalecki: I think it has some old tar, hope you'll get npm working
