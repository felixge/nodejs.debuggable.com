[00:02] tanepiper: SubStack: were there any hacks you had to do in your ssl implementation?

[00:04] ryah: mraleph: ?
[00:04] mraleph: ryah: what are you planning to do with --trace?
[00:04] SubStack: oh snap, can just require('https') now
[00:04] tanepiper: ryah is trolling the ruby and python community with nodejs
[00:04] mraleph: ryah: that was my way of saying hi :-)
[00:04] ryah: mraleph: i want to enable it remotely pipe it through sockeets
[00:05] mraleph: oh
[00:05] ryah: ACTION does some stretchs. _o/   \o/  \o_
[00:05] mraleph: to trace execution of a remote server… I see.
[00:06] ryah: mraleph: but i want no probe-effect when it's not running
[00:06] ryah: is there anyway i could force it to reload the code so that nothing is JITed
[00:06] polotek has joined the channel
[00:06] ryah: maybe with liveedit?
[00:07] ryah: then after the trace allow code to become JITed again
[00:07] gozala has joined the channel
[00:08] possibilities has joined the channel
[00:08] mraleph: hmm. what do you mean by "allow code to become JITed". if you don't allow V8 to JIT it is as good as dead
[00:09] ryah: mraleph: what happens when --trace is run?
[00:09] langworthy has joined the channel
[00:09] ryah: mraleph: sorry, i may be exposing my ignorance of how VM swork.
[00:09] mraleph: when you enable it V8 generates some special code in prologue and epilogue of a function.
[00:09] ryah: a
[00:09] ryah: h
[00:09] maushu_: Isn't liveedit basically a hacky way to use evals and reflection?
[00:10] mraleph: this code goes to runtime and prints trace.
[00:10] ryah: mraleph: where is the code that it puts in there?
[00:10] ryah: mraleph: can you show me?
[00:10] SubStack: tanepiper: https works!
[00:10] mjsx: eval("foo") returns the function "foo" in a module but, ugh, there must be a better way
[00:10] ryah: mraleph: if it wasn't printing to stdout - do you think it would slow down V8 signifigantly still ?
[00:10] SubStack: now whipping up a connect example
[00:11] mraleph: maushu_: liveedit allows editing of source with hot reload.
[00:11] mjsx: (why does this["foo"] return a different result in the REPL compared to a script or module??)
[00:12] Chekov has joined the channel
[00:12] mraleph: ryah: sure. assembly is pretty much irrelevant it's just a call to runtime. so open runtime.cc and search for Runtime_TraceEnter/Runtime_TraceExit
[00:12] ryah: mraleph: i'd really like to be able to put a little conditinal branch at the beginning and end of each function
[00:12] maushu_: mraleph, nothing you can't do with some crazy context manipulation and evals.
[00:12] mackry has joined the channel
[00:12] mraleph: maushu_: no. you can't do what it does with evals. you update closure source and all already existing closure instances get updated code.
[00:13] mraleph: ryah: and yes. it will probably become slower with it. runtime calls are not cheap.
[00:14] mraleph: ryah: hmm. conditional branch to where? on what condition?
[00:15] ryah: mraleph: DTRACE_ENABLED :)
[00:15] mackry: Anyone here willing to help with an ajax request, getting "Empty string error"? using jquery ajax() with data: {'url' : 'hi'}, sending to return.php - echo $_POST['url'];
[00:15] mraleph: ah. heh. should have seen that comming.
[00:16] ryah: i wonder if i put that into the codegen
[00:16] mraleph: but why you want to dtrace all function calls
[00:16] ryah: two conditionals in each function call shouldn't be too bad?
[00:16] ryah: why not?
[00:16] mraleph: I think should be fine.
[00:17] mraleph: but only measurements can show :-)
[00:18] ryah: now the question is how do i program a conditional in the codegen?
[00:18] mraleph: well. does it make sense to dtrace user level code (say some template formatting stuff)? I thought people are mostly insterested in low-level calls.
[00:18] ryah: it makes sense, then you can build scripts which - say measure all the EventEmitter.call functions
[00:18] ryah: or something
[00:19] ryah: we've got really nice dtrace stuff at work
[00:19] mackry has joined the channel
[00:19] ryah: (soon to be public)
[00:19] mraleph: conditionals are simple something like: __ cmp(something, something_else); __ j(eq, &label); 
[00:20] ryah: could i just make a frame_->CallRuntime(Runtime::kTraceEnter, 0); after the __ cmp ?
[00:21] Yuffster has joined the channel
[00:21] mraleph: well I you want to measure calls to EventEmitter.call you can just do EventEmitter.call = measure(EventEmitter.call) AFAIK 
[00:21] mraleph: that does not look like v8 code :-)
[00:21] mraleph: first of all you need to jump over CallRuntime
[00:22] ryah: ah, right.
[00:22] ryah: JumpTarget
[00:22] ryah: oh you guys...
[00:23] ryah: you're so cute with your C++ stuff.
[00:23] SubStack: tanepiper: pow, you can npm link this: https://github.com/substack/Socket.IO-node 
[00:23] mraleph: so it's more like __ cmp(); __ j(not_equal, &done); __ CallRuntime(); __ bind(&done);
[00:23] mraleph: ryah: omg don't read normal codegen
[00:23] mraleph: classic one is destined to die
[00:24] ryah: mraleph: _full or non-full ?

[00:25] mraleph: btw you can try to run some benchmarks with —trace enabled by default. to see whether it really goes slower or not
[00:26] mraleph: and how much slower it goes.
[00:27] ryah: VMs are too hard for me. Like the code that your writing is not what is running.
[00:27] ryah: freaks me out...
[00:27] ryah:     if (FLAG_trace) {
[00:27] ryah:       frame_->CallRuntime(Runtime::kTraceEnter, 0);
[00:27] ryah:       // Ignore the return value.

[00:29] mraleph: yeah. compilers mix metalevel and level of an actually running code...
[00:32] ryah: mraleph: is there a string containing the function name somewhere?
[00:32] ryah: null terminated?
[00:33] mraleph: hmm. well there is jsfunction->shared()->name()

[02:28] seanp2k: http://pastebin.com/McA2yHgC  this is my problem
[02:29] seanp2k: is this due to getPage not running before I'm sending back myBody
[02:29] tmpvar: seanp2k, really?
[02:30] datapimp: is that realy the url you're parsing it? does that work?
[02:30] tmpvar: seanp2k, define myBody after http on line 21 and it should work
[02:30] seanp2k: tmpvar: what should I set it to?  It's supposed to be the body of the page it fetches
[02:30] tmpvar: empty string
[02:30] seanp2k: tmpvar: let me try
[02:31] tmpvar: btw: this is good for now.. i have other suggestions if you are down for that
[02:32] seanp2k: new error http://pastebin.com/Rndznfmu
[02:32] seanp2k: let me also say that I picked up JS two days ago, so I'm by no means good at it
[02:33] tmpvar: ah
[02:33] seanp2k: I'm eventually making this into a scraper for page content from the Dell site...I want to use pass it JSON and pass back JSON for looking up service tags on servers
[02:33] tmpvar: i think i see what you are trying to do
[02:33] seanp2k: it's kind of like an external API that scrapes stuff for you
[02:33] tmpvar: ah, right
[02:34] seanp2k: but...will this http mirror stuff just not work because it's not designed to do this?
[02:34] gf3 has joined the channel
[02:34] seanp2k: like...this seems like a better job for a "proxy" type thing
[02:34] tmpvar: so if you look at the http server example on nodejs.org you'll notice that it binds to events: data, end
[02:35] tmpvar: yeah, the issue here is, that code doesn't get and data from the client
[02:35] tmpvar: im talking about line 36 heh

[02:44] seanp2k: tmpvar: aww snap, it works.  thx, going to work on my dell API thing now I guess
[02:44] seanp2k: tmpvar: I don't really understand what you did there...did you create another function?
[02:44] seanp2k: tmpvar: or is "callback" a special name?
[02:44] tmpvar: callback is not special
[02:45] tmpvar: functions are fist class objects so you can just pass em around in javascript :)
[02:46] seanp2k: tmpvar: this kind of blows my mind coming from C-style langs...trying to follow the execution order of this is confusing me
[02:46] tmpvar: yeah, thats one of the first things that is confusing.. along with scope
[02:46] tmpvar: if I may, I'd recommend you getting a book: "javascript the good parts"
[02:48] seanp2k: tmpvar: thx, I'll check it out...yeah, scope in this case is quite confusing because of global / local stuff and IDK where "body" is coming from
[02:48] tmpvar: it gets passed through!
[02:49] seanp2k: tmpvar: oo, from request in the getPage function?
[02:49] tmpvar: yep
[02:49] tmpvar: back through the callback :)

[03:29] unomi has joined the channel
[03:30] seanp2k: the problem is that if a page requests other objects it'll throw an invalid protocol error.....not sure how to solve that without forking from the node code to handle the subsequent requests
[03:30] tmpvar: ok, so the http.createServer() call takes a callback, whenever you get a request it will call that function with the request data
[03:30] tmpvar: it shouldn't be fetching other resources in your usecase
[03:31] tmpvar: OH
[03:31] tmpvar: i see what you mean
[03:31] tmpvar: yeah, just filter that in the body of the createServer callback

[03:46] nornagon_: for one, you can overlap them
[03:46] dnyy: nornagon: right :/
[03:46] seanp2k: tmpvar: OK, so if the HTTP response is NOT 200 (like 301 if a site redirects to the www-version)... is there to update to the new URL and try to salvage the request?  Here I'm just trying to drop it, but node is still throwing an error: http://pastebin.com/gzk33sjU
[03:46] dnyy: i was doing it manually, huge #replace of any combo but that was getting huge. i imagine there's a better way, i just can't think of it.
[03:46] nornagon_: dnyy: do you need to deal with overlapping codes?
[03:47] nornagon_: if not, you can do it fairly simply with a regex
[03:47] dnyy: i need to be able to </span> every <span> :/
[03:47] dnyy: or well, no i don't, since they send [0 to reset it

"yyyy-mm-dd hh:ss" will parse in v8 but returns NaN/null in spidermonkey/mozilla/safari ...

[07:18] seivan: teag
[07:18] seivan: yeah*
[07:18] mscdex: no, the data should be sent when you .write()
[07:18] seivan: It does the first time
[07:18] seivan: like initial connect callback i write and the client gets it
[07:18] seivan: but the next ones in the data callback, nope
[07:19] seivan: neither partial or full data gets to the iOS client
[07:19] seivan: I am trying to figure out what 	[sock readDataWithTimeout:0.5 tag:0]; and 	//[sock readDataToData:[AsyncSocket CRLFData] withTimeout:-1.0 tag:0];  means

[08:24] gravyrobber has joined the channel
[08:24] franck34: my google chrome don't want to stay with websocket, it switching to xhr, and i don't see something abnormal while sniffing with ngrep
[08:26] SubStack: you can set the list of transports to use directly in the params hash to io.Listen()
[08:30] franck34: i'd like to stay with websocket in fact
[08:30] franck34: got a nginx reverse proxy in front of node
[08:30] franck34: wondering if that is the cause of the prob
[08:30] SubStack: could be!

[08:33] msucan has joined the channel
[08:46] tmpvar: SubStack, what is the plan for dnode?
[08:46] tmpvar: it seems pretty awesome now, is there any optimizations/features that you are working on?
[08:46] tmpvar: s/is/are
[08:46] SubStack: tmpvar: well I'm waiting on guillermo to push out a very tiny patch to socket.io
[08:47] SubStack: I have the v0.6 branch just waiting to go live
[08:47] tmpvar: meaning?
[08:47] tmpvar: :P
[08:47] SubStack: dnode v0.6 works with browserify out of the box
[08:47] mr_daniel has joined the channel
[08:47] SubStack: so you can require('dnode') browser-side!
[08:47] tmpvar: interesting
[08:48] SubStack: also the implementation is a whole lot cleaner now that I spun off the protocol into its own module, dnode-protocol
[08:48] Lorentz has joined the channel
[08:48] SubStack: the browser-side and server-side code both require() that module now
[08:48] SubStack: and I rolled out middleware in dnode v0.5
[08:49] SubStack: I'll start getting some more use out of that with authentication plugins and perhaps replication primitives
[08:49] tmpvar: nice
[08:50] tmpvar: i havent looked to deeply at dnode
[08:50] tmpvar: but it seems similar to something that i was thinking of
[08:50] tmpvar: which has quite a wide breadth
[08:50] tmpvar: object synchronization between client/server
[08:50] tmpvar: delta compression/ etc
[08:50] SubStack: yep, a pretty hard problem
[08:50] tmpvar: it is
[08:51] SubStack: oh at some point I want to roll out ssl on tcp sockets
[08:51] tmpvar: mostly because its hard to test
[08:51] SubStack: and gzip compression
[08:51] SubStack: but not just yet
[08:51] tmpvar: thats just going to add overhead to the server though, no?
[08:52] tmpvar: transport will be faster, but you'll spend more time transcoding
[08:52] SubStack: it will be configurable
[08:52] tmpvar: fair enough
[08:52] SubStack: requires experimentation
[08:53] SubStack: gzip compression might speed up browserling some
[08:53] tmpvar: if you could cache gzip output
[08:53] tmpvar: but thats a different point
[08:53] tmpvar: have you thought much about object sync between client/server?
[08:54] tmpvar: sorry, trying to drive the conversation into something I am extremely interested in
[08:54] SubStack: it's not hard to write one-way synchronization with EventEmitters
[08:55] SubStack: multi-way is harder because you need to resolve conflicts
[08:55] SubStack: perhaps some optimistic locking, STM-style system
[08:55] sstreza has joined the channel
[08:56] SubStack: but then modifications need to be encapsulated into transaction blocks
[08:56] SubStack: so you need to be careful about side-effects because they could be run multiple times
[08:56] tmpvar: makes sense
[08:56] dspree has joined the channel
[08:56] dspree has joined the channel
[08:56] SubStack: this might also be a good basis for an all-javascript graph database
[08:57] tmpvar: so i tried to implement this in motionjs.. but i could not figure out how to simulate multiple network pipes to a single server
[08:57] tmpvar: yeah, i think its important work, but i've been tied down by the details of testing ;)
[08:57] SubStack: and this would tie everything I've been working on together pretty nicely
[08:57] tmpvar: aka: i wont move forward until i can properly test ;)
[08:58] SubStack: especially my claim that the database should cator to the programming model
[08:58] tmpvar: im not familiar with that claim 
[08:58] SubStack: and the programming model shouldn't need to cede to the database layer, ORM-style
[08:59] SubStack: transparent persistence woo!
[08:59] tmpvar: then you code for the lowest common denominator which means you end up with a key value store
[09:00] SubStack: I only care about making it nice in javascript
[09:00] SubStack: like how dnode was designed
[09:01] tmpvar: SubStack, to be honest, i havent dug into the internals of dnode
[09:01] tmpvar: but I'm pretty sure I know how it works ;)
[09:02] SubStack: when I first posted it to HN everybody thought it used eval() or Function.prototype.toString()
[09:02] SubStack: that would be much harder!
[09:02] SubStack: anyhow
[09:02] tmpvar: haha
[09:03] tmpvar: yeah, i realize you are a big boy :)
[09:03] SubStack: a motionjs middleware for dnode would be pretty boss
[09:03] tmpvar: yeah, i wont move on until i can test in isolation though
[09:03] tmzt: what's motionjs?
[09:03] tmpvar: im not a big fan of "spawning a server" and 5 clients
[09:04] tmpvar: you know what i mean?
[09:04] herbySk has joined the channel
[09:04] SubStack: testing from the outside?
[09:04] tmpvar: i want it all to be in memory, so i can control timings and such.. which is extremely important for motion.js
[09:04] SubStack: versus testing the internals?
[09:04] SubStack: it's nice to have a mix of both
[09:04] tmpvar: sure, but to start I feel that it needs to be all whitebox'd
[09:05] tmpvar: cleanroom, unit tests, etc
[09:05] herbySk74 has joined the channel
[09:05] SubStack: I did that with dnode v0.6
[09:05] tmpvar: i would LOVE to hear ideas, if anyone has them
[09:05] tmpvar: yeah?
[09:05] tmpvar: simulation of events between one server and multiple clients?
[09:05] SubStack: abstracted out all the protocol algorithms into dnode-protocol and it made everything much simpler and easier to test
[09:06] tmpvar: hrm
[09:06] tmzt: so just long polling can be implemented now?
[09:06] tmpvar: ?
[09:06] tmzt: without changing dnode itself
[09:07] SubStack: tmpvar: why long polling?
[09:07] tmpvar: wooooah
[09:07] franck34: ACTION testing faye
[09:07] tmzt: me
[09:07] tmpvar: on ff yes
[09:07] tmpvar: because they want to be "secure" waaaah
[09:07] SubStack: tmpvar: if you're asking if you can write your own dnode-protocol thingy on top of arbitrary transports now using dnode-protocol, then yes

[09:08] tmpvar: SubStack, heh. I would love to not. I just need to be able to create pipes between clients
[09:08] tmzt: I just want one protocol so that it's not a negotiation and so that the connection happens as quickly as possible
[09:08] tmpvar: induce lag, etc
[09:09] tmpvar: tmzt, use flash sockets?
[09:09] SubStack: tmzt: socket.io has options for that
[09:09] tmzt: then I'm dependent on flash
[09:09] tmpvar: horrible, but might be better than long poles
[09:09] tmpvar: :P
[09:09] SubStack: you can specify the transports list directly and there's an option to save which transport succeeded last time in a cookie
[09:10] SubStack: and to use that right away on the next connection
[09:10] tmzt: SubStack: I must have missed the client side because it kept trying multiplart/replace before falling back to xhr
[09:10] tmpvar: sounds like he does not want long poll
[09:10] vonkow has joined the channel
[09:10] SubStack: can just specify a transports list to socket.io without longpoll in it
[09:11] tmpvar: lol
[09:11] SubStack: but that's something you should take up with guillermo
[09:11] tmpvar: the options are pretty grim these days, no?
[09:11] tmpvar: web sockets were hot
[09:11] mscdex: lolwut
[09:11] tmpvar: but now you fall back to longpoll / flashsocket?
[09:11] tmpvar: hi mscdex 
[09:11] mscdex: yo
[09:12] SubStack: it's also awesome how I can bend my projects to my highly specific ends
[09:12] tmpvar: no idea what that means
[09:13] SubStack: like how browserify supports a special 'browserify' field in package.json just so I could make require('dnode') work awesomely browser-side
[09:13] tmpvar: you are quite obsessed with that heh
[09:13] SubStack: polluted namespaces suck
[09:13] mscdex: who wants to write a meebo clone in node?
[09:14] mscdex: :D
[09:14] tmzt: tmorrow?
[09:14] tmpvar: mscdex, ive never used
[09:14] tmzt: for the twilio contest?
[09:14] SubStack: what does meebo do anyhow?
[09:14] tmpvar: what do they support?
[09:14] mscdex: no, i just thought i'd throw that out there
[09:14] SubStack: I got contacted by their recruiters once
[09:14] SubStack: looks like some kind of IM thing
[09:14] tmpvar: SubStack,  lol
[09:14] tmpvar: yeah

[09:15] tmpvar: well.
[09:15] mscdex: not sure of the status though
[09:15] tmpvar: so what is left?
[09:15] tmpvar: aim direct connect ;)
[09:16] SubStack: also I really need to finish up this node-ssh-server so I can land the latest browserify feature and close a deal
[09:16] tmpvar: haha, or yahoo messenger.. blah
[09:16] tmzt: SubStack: hmm?
[09:16] mscdex: msn and yahoo i guess
[09:16] SubStack: that's right, an ssh server in node.js!

[09:26] tmpvar: php is no love of mine
[09:26] tmzt: mscdex: can you check signups for me?
[09:26] tmpvar: mscdex, that means you pull some weight..
[09:26] SubStack: 100% of our developers agree!
[09:26] mscdex: heh
[09:26] tmzt: hah, yeah I'm the dev and the configuration person, never know which to do
[09:26] SubStack: ie: you
[09:26] tmpvar: if you were to say "fuck you" then .. they are "scareeewed"

[09:27] mscdex: tmpvar: yeah maybe, the job scene around here isn't that great, so the last thing i need is to lose this client :p
[09:27] tmzt: 502?
[09:27] mscdex: yeah i get 502 also
[09:27] tmpvar: bad gateway
[09:28] mscdex: i thought gateway was bought out?
[09:28] mscdex: :p

[09:30] tmpvar: sholmes, that is vast
[09:30] SubStack: mscdex: work for browserling remotely :D
[09:30] SubStack: as soon as we land some VC money at least
[09:30] mscdex: heh
[09:30] sholmes: tmpvar: good basic paradigms then. :P
[09:31] tmzt: SubStack: how many people are working there?
[09:31] SubStack: tmzt: just myself and pkrumins right now
[09:31] tmpvar: man
[09:31] tmpvar: there needs to be a comic about the shit people put up with before a vc
[09:31] tmpvar: and then after
[09:31] SubStack: just signed the incorporation paperwork on friday
[09:31] tmpvar: like to frames
[09:31] tmzt: it's hard to do even #leanstartup with *no* money
[09:31] mscdex: tmzt: signup worked fine for me
[09:31] tmpvar: excitement to lawsuit

[09:32] tmzt: mscdex: cool, check the resume builder and see if you can edit/save
[09:32] tmpvar: SubStack, dont be a douche
[09:32] SubStack: eh?
[09:32] tmpvar: im sure its important that we all know how much money you have lined up.. but no.
[09:32] tmpvar: dont do it.
[09:33] tmpvar: its douchey
[09:33] SubStack: didn't mean it that way
[09:33] tmzt: it's not really that much for what they are trying to build
[09:33] SubStack: meant it more that I completely ran out of money a few months back >_<
[09:33] mscdex: tmzt: hrmm, nothing shows up when i click resume builder except a Save button
[09:33] tmzt: SubStack: have you considered flash? I know it's evil, etc. but as3 is pretty nice as a programming language/vm
[09:33] SubStack: and now I can eat again
[09:34] tmzt: oh nice
[09:34] tmpvar: SubStack, eating is good :P
[09:34] tmzt: hold on
[09:34] tmzt: jquery ajax is bad
[09:34] SubStack: tmzt: I would have to get a dev system setup for that
[09:34] tmpvar: im just saying.. throwing around monies in a chatroom is .. 
[09:34] tmzt: SubStack: flex :)
[09:35] tmpvar: flexbuilder
[09:35] tmpvar: PAY FOR IT
[09:35] tmzt: it's really just strongly typed javascript with real sockets
[09:35] tmzt: no flex+ant
[09:35] tmpvar: how about flash develop
[09:35] SubStack: flexbuilder eh?
[09:35] tmzt: or that
[09:35] tmpvar: no interface
[09:35] mscdex: ACTION shakes a fist at flash
[09:35] tmzt: tmpvar: what do you need an interface for?
[09:35] tmpvar: you get to design it all in flash
[09:35] tmzt: guys, not flash, flash as3==java applet

[09:37] tmpvar: felix is a monster
[09:37] tmpvar: in a good way
[09:37] sholmes: tmpvar: I like your quick confident answer. ;P
[09:37] tmpvar: you can trust that felix will get shit done. if it doesnt work, and you find a bug he will make it work
[09:38] mscdex: he hasn't landed blob support yet though :S
[09:38] tmpvar: hey, its a big job ;)
[09:38] tmpvar: where are your patches?
[09:38] tmzt: mscdex: I'm debating rushing a twilio and competing for the cleveland @startupbus
[09:38] sholmes: I wonder why the API for node-mysql is:  var client = new Client(); client.user = 'blabla'; client.password = 'blabla';
[09:38] tmpvar: har .. deeee derp
[09:38] mscdex: tmpvar: i sent him a patch and test :)
[09:38] sholmes: rather than: var client = new Client('user', 'password')?
[09:38] mscdex: awhile ago
[09:38] tmpvar: haha
[09:38] tmzt: I've done two and a half apps with it already
[09:39] tmzt: one in node
[09:39] franck34: sholmes: you can, new Client({user:'myUser',password:'bla'});
[09:39] tmpvar: mscdex, see...
[09:39] tmpvar: thats what happens when you own
[09:39] sholmes: franck34: ok awesome.
[09:39] franck34: sholmes: warning if you are using mysql socket rather than ip
[09:39] tmpvar: you are just biding your time sitting there right on the razors edge
[09:39] mscdex: just sayin ;-)
[09:40] tmzt: SubStack: I wonder if passing textures to a 2d object would work fast enough to stream rfb to flash
[09:40] sholmes: franck34: Hmm?
[09:40] tmpvar: oh of course, im not blaming you either ;)
[09:40] SubStack: tmzt: textures in flash?
[09:40] tmzt: and the best part commonjs/browserify should port to as3 with some massaging for typed variables
[09:40] SubStack: ACTION is completely unfamiliar with flash programming
[09:40] tmzt: SubStack: yeah, using the gpu
[09:41] tmpvar: mscdex, i feel like we should share a beer at some point. are you going to js or nodeconf?
[09:41] tmpvar: or has the php completely tied you down?
[09:41] mscdex: heh
[09:41] mscdex: not unless there's something more east
[09:41] mscdex: :)
[09:41] tmpvar: PHP
[09:41] tmpvar: dude, its like 2 days
[09:41] tmpvar: :(
[09:41] mscdex: east coast needs some love
[09:41] tmpvar: come out to nyc
[09:41] tmpvar: bk and nycjs, wut wut?
[09:42] tmzt: SubStack: the browser client seems to be your bottleneck from what I can see on my end
[09:42] mscdex: bk?
[09:42] tmpvar: brooklyn
[09:42] mscdex: ah
[09:42] tmpvar: thuggin down here in kings county
[09:42] SubStack: tmzt: from what we can gather it's the network throughput and latency
[09:43] SubStack: was at a place with 100 Mbit down testing browserling and it was near native performance
[09:43] tmzt: too bad it has to work in a lowely cube on a saturated network :)
[09:43] SubStack: yeah, we have some more tricks to make it fast
[09:43] SubStack: todo with copyrect detection
[09:43] SubStack: just other stuff to finish first
[09:44] SubStack: like using ssh for tunneing ^_^
[09:44] tmzt: I want to see a flash-based ssh client too
[09:44] tmzt: I know it's possible
[09:44] tmzt: it has some globally relevant uses
[09:44] tmpvar: lol
[09:45] tmpvar: ah flash over ssh tunnel ?
[09:45] tmzt: tmpvar: I mean implement the client in as3
[09:45] tmzt: ssl and everything
[09:45] tmzt: though flash sockets already have ssl
[09:45] tmpvar: as3->ssh->browserling?
[09:45] SubStack: just ssh -> browserling
[09:46] tmzt: hmm
[09:46] franck34: sholmes: love you https://gist.github.com/846056
[09:46] tmzt: SubStack: so you are working on a ssh client for js in the browser?
[09:46] SubStack: tmzt: an ssh server
[09:46] tmpvar: we need a better option than flash
[09:46] tmpvar: for fucks sake.
[09:46] tmpvar: bah. goodnight.

[10:01] Jourkey: For basic auth

[10:03] zomgbie has joined the channel
[10:03] datapimp has joined the channel
[10:03] franck34: sholmes: no, it's async
[10:03] franck34: sholmes: that's why i'm using 'Step' module
[10:04] franck34: to be able to code in the node way
[10:04] dingomanatee has joined the channel
[10:04] sholmes: then how in the example is client.query("USE "+TEST_DATABASE) ran before the following client.query() call?
[10:04] franck34: mm, link ?
[10:05] Jourkey: in an example I see something like this: var uid = require("../support/express/support/connect/lib/connect/utils").uid
[10:05] Jourkey: i installed express with npm
[10:05] Jourkey: how do I require the uid?
[10:05] franck34: sholmes: i think you HAVE to client.query("your request",function(err,reply) {}); every time
[10:06] franck34: else you don't have the garantue of the order of requests
[10:06] franck34: again, that's why i'm using Step module
[10:06] sholmes: franck34: if you look at the tutorial on the github page, there's no callback for the "USE" query
[10:07] franck34: it's a bad practice. callback is for every query.
[10:07] sholmes: hmm.
[10:08] steffkes has joined the channel
[10:08] sholmes: franck34: in your gist, where's insert() defined?
[10:09] sholmes: err
[10:09] sholmes: nevermind
[10:09] franck34: do you see Step( ... ) ?
[10:10] franck34: first function  is making the request, and the client.query callback is 'this'
[10:10] franck34: and 'this', with step, is the next function
[10:10] jetienne has joined the channel
[10:11] sholmes: I see Step. But you know you could use \ inside string for multilines
[10:11] sholmes: no need for req+="mumbo jumbo"
[10:11] franck34: i know that, just an old habit
[10:11] erabuj has joined the channel

[10:14] liquidproof has joined the channel
[10:14] franck34: sholmes: first, the request, having "?" rather than real value, second is an array a value, in the same order than required the query, third is the callback
[10:15] revoof has joined the channel
[10:15] argb has joined the channel
[10:16] sholmes: Oh I see, it's a way of inserting variables into the query, safely
[10:16] franck34: yep, escaping value is made by node-mysql
[10:16] argb: good evening everybody
[10:17] sholmes: argb: hi
[10:18] argb: hi
[10:18] franck34: ACTION faye tested succesfully, now testing persevere
[10:18] sholmes: franck34: So how would I best go about making a module that contains all the mysql, this way I can just simply use that module to access my data from the DB
[10:18] seivan: hmm
[10:19] seivan: Is there a way to make so that the socket sends everything it has instead of buffering?
[10:19] seivan: Right now it seems like it "collects" data before sending it.
[10:20] franck34: sholmes: wait

[10:22] franck34: sholmes: first module: https://gist.github.com/846072
[10:23] sholmes: franck34: how do I know if the port is needed?
[10:24] sholmes: also, I don't want to expose the mysql connection, rather I want to expose a custom API that deals with the private connection.
[10:24] sholmes: mymodule.getAll(), mymodule.find(), for example.
[10:26] argb: lemes,how do you typed the red color words?
[10:26] franck34: sholmes: second module https://gist.github.com/846075
[10:26] tahu has joined the channel
[10:27] franck34: so with the second module, in your main program, you just have to var users=require('users.js') and then users.insert({email:'foo@bar.com'},yourCallback);
[10:28] franck34: sholmes: for port/socket, just think of it you have problem connecting database with node ..

[10:32] mattyf: not too sure what that means, sorry. I've got a script called run_tests, and using sh run_tests to kick it off
[10:32] mattyf: I thought __dirname was meant to point to the dir i'm running sh from?
[10:33] SubStack: __dirname is the directory that the current script resides in
[10:33] SubStack: process.cwd() is the current working directory
[10:33] argb: :/list
[10:34] mattyf: ok maybe __dirname isnt the root cause, basically I'm getting 'word unexpected (expecting ")")' when trying to run sh run_tests

[10:39] SubStack: mattyf: which line does it die on?
[10:40] franck34: sholmes: query v8bot 
[10:40] SubStack: pastebin the stacktrace too?
[10:40] mattyf:  slowly I added line by line, its the first require.paths.push command
[10:40] SubStack: oh require.paths is deprecated
[10:40] mattyf: require.paths.push(__dirname);
[10:40] mattyf: ohhhh right lol, im going from a textbook
[10:40] mattyf: test driven javascript development
[10:40] SubStack: hmmm might still work though I see it's still in the docs
[10:40] mattyf: whats the new function?
[10:41] sholmes: franck34: what about v8bot?
[10:41] franck34: v8bot: help
[10:41] v8bot: franck34: Use v8: <code> to evaluate code or "`v commands" for a list of v8bot commands.

[10:43] franck34: does anybody know a pubsub framework with a sort of 'retreive' feature ? (publish in a chan/subscribe to a chan/retreive last N items from a chan) 
[10:44] mattyf: yeah im stumped, still trying to work out ubuntu at the same time
[10:44] mattyf: maybe i'll just use require('./deps/nodunit') instead?
[10:44] khinester: i am running nginx with GeoIP support. how would one pass the client IP address to the node.js application from nginx?
[10:44] SubStack: franck34: you can just send that list .on('connect', fn)
[10:45] SubStack: that's what the socket.io chat server example does
[10:46] sholmes: what is a tick?
[10:46] sholmes: node.js:116
[10:46] sholmes:         throw e; // process.nextTick error, or 'error' event on first tick
[10:46] mattyf: hmmm whats another global function i can test with, doesnt seem to like anything being passed through during fn invoc.
[10:46] mattyf: e.g. require() doesnt throw and error, require("nodeunit") does lol
[10:47] franck34: SubStack: yep, i'm already doing that, just to know if there is a normalized way to do that
[10:47] SubStack: sholmes: ticks go by as the event system dispatches events
[10:47] franck34: thx

[10:48] sholmes: ah
[10:48] SubStack: goes the clock
[10:48] sholmes: haha
[10:48] sholmes: so what could this error mean?
[10:48] SubStack: sholmes: it means some object emitted an 'error' event and you didn't catch it
[10:49] mattyf: ok got it i dont think my chmod worked on the scripts
[10:49] sholmes: strange, because this code was working a while ago.

[10:50] samcday: Question: how would I go about stashing a persistent object, but still make it a weak reference, so that way if it's not referenced anywhere in JS anymore it can be GC'd?
[10:51] everton has joined the channel
[10:51] samcday: Like, let's say I have an object called Parent that can provide Children via an indexed accessor. I want to return the same object if the same accessor is ... accessed.
[10:52] extra11 has joined the channel
[10:52] samcday: But I don't want to keep the object in memory forever if no JS code has got a ref to the Child object anymore.
[10:52] sholmes: ACTION almost fell asleep
[10:53] sholmes: going to have to finish this tomorrow
[10:53] samcday: I'm currently trying to stash the Child in an internal Object on the Parent, but obviously that's going to stop the Child from being GC'd -_-
[10:53] SubStack: samcday: building a graph?
[10:54] liar has joined the channel
[10:54] samcday: SubStack: Pretty much yup. Specifically I'm wrapping libgit2 natively
[10:54] samcday: So basically I have a Repo object, if a commit is queried by id, I want to return the same commit if it's already been grabbed
[10:54] SubStack: why not just set a node to be the new root when you need to look at a subtree?

[11:01] franck34: did you check is this port is not already used?

[11:16] sholmes: ?
[11:17] mscdex: never used express, sorry
[11:18] sholmes: Well, as far as I know, Express doesn't have any mechinism for loading models or controllers, only views.
[11:18] sholmes: So I'm left with require()ing them.
[11:19] sholmes: But requiring is a pain, because if my controller, located under a /controllers directory, needed a model, I would need to use .. to first step out of the controllers directory when requireing.

[11:24] sholmes: I would load the models within the object too.

[11:27] sholmes: is exports.func depreciated for module.exports.func?
[11:28] sholmes: should I be using module.exports over exports?
[11:29] SubStack: use module.exports when you want to set all the exports in one go
[11:29] SubStack: for instance if you want require() to return a function
[11:29] sholmes: I see.
[11:30] mscdex: woo -- ncurses 5.8!
[11:30] sholmes: So it's okay to just use exports.property to export a property.
[11:30] SubStack: crazy two's compliment
[11:30] SubStack: ACTION looks up how that goes again
[11:30] mscdex: 3 years later!
[11:30] sholmes: Next question, is there a way for me to write blocking code if I wanted?
[11:31] SubStack: sholmes: sometimes

[11:31] SubStack: sometimes trivially at least
[11:31] SubStack: everything is possible with c++ modules

[11:54] jetienne: Evet: euhhh from the level of your questions, this is too hard for your current level
[11:54] jetienne: Evet: ah ok
[11:54] jetienne: Evet: so you are a beginner only in node
[11:54] jetienne: Evet: if you got the code in C, to port it as a node plugin is not hard
[11:54] Evet: jetienne: i dont know much about oop of c++
[11:55] jetienne: Evet: but you just need the glue to your C code
[11:55] jetienne: Evet: you dont need to rewrite all in c++
[11:55] jetienne: Evet: or you could recode it in js 
[11:55] Evet: jetienne: i'll give a try
[11:56] jetienne: Evet: there is a tutorial for a helloworld in c++ as node extension
[11:56] Evet: jetienne: node good at parsing, sql layer would be done in js. can i combine c and js?
[11:56] jetienne: let me see if i can get back
[11:56] jetienne: parsing sql in js ?
[11:56] jetienne: Evet: you are serious ? you did it in c already ?
[11:56] jetienne: i write a sql parser in early 90's no way im rewriting one :)
[11:56] Evet: jetienne: according to language benchmarks, v8 better than c at parsing
[11:57] Evet: jetienne: and its more forkable by community. just a js file, right?
[11:57] jetienne: Evet: change benchmarks or optim your C /)

[12:50] Wizek: dingomanatee, if you tell me where to download one, I1ll have. :) Will that resolve my building errors?
[12:51] dingomanatee: Wizek: cygwin is such a lousy representation of Node's real world deployment environment that even if I could help you with this problem I would be hurting your career. 
[12:51] dingomanatee: I know that is not what you came here for but it is the truth. Node is simply awful on cygwin. 
[12:52] dingomanatee: Terribly, disgustingly, bad. 
[12:52] dingomanatee: I spend my days maintaining a Drupal stack on WAMP. And using Zend Framework to pull JSON out of it for FLEX. 
[12:52] dingomanatee: Node on CygWin is worse than that. Relly really worse. 
[12:53] Wizek: dingomanatee, it does what I need for experimenting
[12:54] Wizek: dingomanatee, just quite hard to get it installed
[12:54] dingomanatee: The better way to go is a) Linode Vitrual Machine Ubuntu b) local virtual machine Ubuntu c) $350 Toshiba from Best Buy Desktop Ubuntu
[12:54] stagas: Wizek: you need to follow these steps: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Building-node.js-on-cygwin-

[12:55] Wizek: stagas, I do, check out my error msg on the screenshot I posted some lines back
[12:55] dingomanatee: Good luck - I really hope you get the help you need - I have no idea how since everyone here who knows what they are doing does not use cygwin. And I mean that sincerely. (both parts)

[12:56] stagas: Wizek: install on a fresh cygwin installation
[12:56] dingomanatee: okay - like I said - good luck and when you get it working, blog your results because we get that kind of question a lot and don't know what to do most of the time. 
[12:56] Wizek: stagas, Already am doing that
[12:57] stagas: Wizek: try checking out 0.4.0 and see if you get the same error
[12:57] dingomanatee: Wizek: No.de, the web service, is having a new release next week. Keep your eyes on that - that will be an much easier place to experiment on. 
[12:59] Wizek: stagas, same for both 0.4.0 and .1
[12:59] Wizek: stagas, let me try rebooting, 2 mins

[13:33] tanepiper: basically my laptop - ubuntu's support for wifi and display drivers is awful - so i use vm's that i can quickly stick up and erase as i'm testing and deving
[13:33] levi501d: but if your worried about making sure your code will function on prod then i've found that works very very reliably
[13:33] dingomanatee: sounds fun.
[13:33] tanepiper: and i use winscp + e-texteditor on windows, with coffeescript support through textmate bundles
[13:34] seivan: https://gist.github.com/33e6e1f7647951b2a53a Why does it only do one publish?
[13:34] mscdex: i use winscp too
[13:35] mscdex: with notepad++

[13:36] tanepiper: other than that, i would never run it as a server on windows

[13:38] dingomanatee: really - even mature self contained stacks like LAMP/WAMP suffer from cross platform issues. You don't have a hope in hell of Node surviving a cross platform environment - I mean with clouds and virtual machines
[13:38] dingomanatee: running a compromised hack on the windows desktop is just - sorry - indefensibly irresponsible. 
[13:38] seivan: I hope Node never makes to Windows
[13:39] seivan: Seriously grow a pair and get over to Unix

[13:40] levi501d: sorry seivan that wasnt for you
[13:40] tanepiper: i gave macs a go, i used to love system 7 back in the day - but modern macs - mehh
[13:40] seivan: Instead you use Windows
[13:40] seivan: Good game.
[13:40] seivan: https://gist.github.com/33e6e1f7647951b2a53a anyone know why this would only publish once?
[13:40] tanepiper: Windows 7 as a user experience is really nice, sorry
[13:40] levi501d: haha, win/mac/linux who why not just bite the bullet and build a real machine and virtualize all of em :)
[13:40] dingomanatee: Yes it is amazing. 
[13:40] tanepiper: MS actually managed to fix vista
[13:40] dingomanatee: I love Steam. 
[13:41] seivan: I loathe WIndows developers
[13:41] snafuz: dude, if it werent for msft's investment in apple 10 yrs ago, there would be no macs now,. dont hate
[13:41] dingomanatee: Windows 7 is the greatest game development / deployment environment out there. 
[13:41] seivan: I never said anything about Microsoft
[13:41] seivan: I'm a Xbox-user
[13:41] seivan: And I love Echange
[13:41] tanepiper: oh yea, don't get me wrong, i'm not a fan of windows dev
[13:41] seivan: Exchange* 
[13:41] seivan: Just that I can't take developers who do other then .NET on Windows seriously.
[13:41] seivan: Like a bad horrible joke

[13:42] levi501d: *debian

[13:43] mscdex: heck yeah
[13:43] levi501d: debian 6 { virt: windows/macosx/vax } very very well
[13:43] mscdex: workbench ftw
[13:43] dingomanatee: I haven't ever heard a Mac developer brag about how amazing his machine is as a web server. If you are deploying on a Ubuntu stack, develop on one - real or virtual. 
[13:43] levi501d: oh you just havent hung out with enough maccies
[13:44] dingomanatee: If the best thing about your mac is that it deploys a virtual Ubuntu machine really well then which operating system are you bragging about - really?

[13:44] mscdex: :D
[13:44] dingomanatee: SDI?
[13:44] mscdex: it was a cinemaware game for the amiga
[13:45] dingomanatee: ah. I loved the Amiga. "THIS IT THE AMIGA PERSONAL COMPUTER:: I CAN SPEAK IN A MALE VOICE:: or a female voice ::
[13:45] dingomanatee: "
[13:45] levi501d: ff8 ftw
[13:45] tanepiper: amiga was awesome
[13:45] snafuz: deluxe paint anyone?
[13:45] tanepiper: i wish i learned to program more on it
[13:46] jetienne: node_modules is new from 0.3 ?
[13:46] mscdex: the other thing i like about cinemaware is that they give away their old amiga games on their website
[13:46] dingomanatee: I used to hang out in the demo room in the student bookstore at U of O painting digital fish on the Amiga. 
[13:46] tanepiper: http://www.effectgames.com/demos/canvascycle/
[13:46] dingomanatee: jetienne - yes
[13:46] tanepiper: ^^ this is amazing amiga like stuff
[13:46] jetienne: dingomanatee: do you know the version in which it appeared ?
[13:46] mscdex: yeah i saw that page before :)
[13:46] dingomanatee: 0.4
[13:47] jetienne: dingomanatee: ok
[13:47] dingomanatee: the node.js docs talk about it at length (relative)
[13:47] levi501d: geez, i feel, young
[13:48] dingomanatee: ACTION 's first computer didn't have a monitor.
[13:48] jetienne: https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/v0.4.0/ChangeLog#L5 <- dingomanatee excelent. thanks
[13:48] jetienne: i did 2year of 6502 and 5 year of 68k :)
[13:48] levi501d: haha, thats awesome, my dad brought home a pdp11 when i was a kid, but that still had a monitor
[13:48] tanepiper: any of you using JSDom?
[13:48] stagas: I had my a1200 plugged on a 14" tv haha
[13:48] dingomanatee: ACTION found a good dom splitter that pulls his document oout into a nested object tree.

[13:51] tanepiper: mscdex: you might enjoy my friend's youtube: http://www.youtube.com/user/Rockythefishman
[13:51] dingomanatee: everyone else seems to like jsdom but I like to have a plain old inspectible lump of object to dissect. 
[13:51] tanepiper: he does lots of amiga stuff
[13:52] tanepiper: dingomanatee: well basically i just want to get some text out of a list of dom elements in a ul list
[13:52] tanepiper: so something like ul > li > .username, ul > li .comment, etc
[13:52] mscdex: tanepiper: cool. yeah i like watching some of the longplays on youtube every now and again :)
[13:52] dingomanatee: You can do that in jsDom - frankly I never figured it out - the docs are kind of "You know, its like DOM. Deal."

[13:58] levi501d: very nice
[13:58] dingomanatee: I'm indexing all this on Mongo and blending it with the node.js documentation and HowToNode to provide a central clearing house for all things node.

[13:59] levi501d: awesomesauce, i'll keep an eye out for that for sure
[13:59] dingomanatee: looks like the live server is crashed right now. 
[14:00] dingomanatee: I bought noogle.io - I'll host it at that when I am ready for a hard launch. 
[14:00] dingomanatee: http://narrative.io:3000/ is back - its several versions old now. 
[14:01] dingomanatee: I want to upgrade it to use mongoose 100% but at this point it is mostly based on kristof-native Mongo. 
[14:01] levi501d: i'd toss in to the wishlist parsing code and adding it to a script bin for each user that is indexed
[14:01] dingomanatee: I'm also adding user functionality with the new release. 
[14:01] SamuraiJack_ has joined the channel
[14:02] dingomanatee: I do want people to be able to pimp their gits - for now I'm just going to add git links for user accounts. 
[14:02] levi501d: nice
[14:02] dingomanatee: I think Git does that job better than I (want to). But a word-index of the git sources would be fun. 
[14:03] dingomanatee: Want to learn about fs? Here is every file in every git that uses it. 
[14:03] dingomanatee: Noogle is actaully a web spider so anything spiderable is on my cross hairs. 
[14:03] levi501d: yeah i hope github comes out with more options for gist on their api
[14:04] dingomanatee: A lot of smart kids want to use Git as a repo for content. 
[14:04] dingomanatee: I might experiment with that at some point. 
[14:05] pauls has joined the channel
[14:05] daveluke has joined the channel
[14:05] levi501d: yeah its pretty useful, it has a search repo's and users etc.. functionality
[14:05] levi501d: so you could use that to pull data in to drilldown after a search pulls up the basics
[14:06] mscdex: i wish gist had the ability to do diffs between revisions and forks, just like you can compare repos
[14:06] mscdex: there's a chrome plugin to do diffs between revisions, but not across forks
[14:07] dingomanatee: By the way if anyone wants to help - I would love to add the node.js mail group to the system. 
[14:08] levi501d: add the emails?
[14:08] dingomanatee: yeh
[14:09] dingomanatee: Right now I break the IRC log into lines, by user, time, day, and word index each one. Store in Mongo.
[14:09] levi501d: ohh, yah, i am not signed up for that, i usually dont sign up for any extra emails if i can help it :D, do they have a repository of emails though, like google groups?
[14:09] dingomanatee: You could do the same with the email chat (sans redundant  stuff). 
[14:10] levi501d: ohh, yeah that would be nice, esp for finding solutions to bugs
[14:10] dingomanatee: http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs-dev/topics?pli=1
[14:10] dingomanatee: I'm sure I can do that - but there are other features I'm rolling out at the moment. 
[14:11] dingomanatee: If anyone wants to fork noogle and add that content to a different colletion it would help a lot. 
[14:11] levi501d: ahh yeah, would you sign up a "user" to receive all emails from the group and parse them?
[14:12] dingomanatee: The easiest I think would be that - set up a node based mail server and sign up as robot@noogle.io
[14:12] dingomanatee: or whatever
[14:12] dingomanatee: Or you could web crawl the google group.That would be the lazy approach as noogle is already a page/spider system.
[14:12] dingomanatee: However mail parsing would be more impressive :D
[14:12] langworthy has joined the channel
[14:13] levi501d: well actually i think it would be less resource intensive, since it wont be scanning on a poll or whatnot it will only need to parse mails as they come in reducing load
[14:13] lgl has joined the channel
[14:13] dingomanatee: Definately
[14:14] levi501d: take the subject and body from the mail, toss the header in for smiles and stick it in the db for parsing when the job runs
[14:14] dingomanatee: Keep in mind this is my first substantial node project so I initially tried to keep it fairly contained and lean on express. 
[14:14] dingomanatee: I'd want to be smart about it and strip off the copy lines.
[14:14] dingomanatee: but yeh that would be sweet. 
[14:14] levi501d: arr agreed
[14:15] levi501d: i'll grab a copy and play around, i cant commit to anything atm the boss dudes are driving me pretty hard on a project for the next couple weeks, but i'll definately see what i can do
[14:15] tmzt: dingomanatee: what is noogle?
[14:16] tmzt: I mean how do you define it
[14:16] pdelgallego has joined the channel
[14:16] levi501d: but if you get a pull from levidehaan that'd be me :D
[14:17] tmzt: email parsing is something I'm looking for, I don't have a background in this stuff so I'm a little lost
[14:19] dingomanatee: http://narrative.io:3000/
[14:19] dingomanatee: I did email parsing for cybyl.com in my last job. 
[14:19] dingomanatee: I used PHP Zend Framework to pick apart the mail messages. 
[14:20] tmzt: I just want to pull out urls and then parse, maybe scrape, those
[14:20] dingomanatee: Yeah - there is nothing magical about the email format - you can regex urls out of email pretty easily - you don't need to know anything about it. 
[14:21] jakeskik has joined the channel
[14:21] tmzt: some of these are highly structured I don't even have my inbox/corpus to look at
[14:21] dingomanatee: noogle is a generalized web spider that I am using to scrape the Nogejs IRC (this) logs. 
[14:21] tmzt: just trying to get the technical pieces in place
[14:21] dingomanatee: Yeah - you can use incrontab on a mail server if you save the messages as seperate files
[14:21] tmzt: if somebody did proper irc search it would be amzing
[14:21] dingomanatee: thats what noogle is. 
[14:21] tmzt: incrontab?
[14:22] dingomanatee: incrontab fires off bash scripts in response to file system changes on Ubuntu. 
[14:22] tmzt: dingomanatee: right, but topic search ,finding the context, where a discussion begins ends
[14:22] dingomanatee: At this point I don't use intelligence on that - yet -
[14:22] tmzt: there's some obscure stuff I have to grep #htc-linux or #android for at times
[14:22] levi501d: use this -> http://code.google.com/p/php-mime-mail-parser/ and some good ole regex and you'll probably be fine
[14:22] dingomanatee: I just search for phrases and grab 300 lines or so around that. 
[14:22] Kudos has joined the channel
[14:23] dingomanatee: I do want to do more intelligent discrimination but so far I've been satisfied with just grabbing a swath of time. 
[14:23] tmzt: can you do a type of graph showing when a certain group of people begin communicating with each other and then drop off
[14:23] tmzt: as in, these three a actively communicating, it must be around this topic
[14:23] dingomanatee: I could - hypothetically - its not that hard - but have not as yet. 
[14:24] dingomanatee: I used to work for a security company and when I started this project that was a priority. To simply provide people with help with Node problems that is too much work for the result. 
[14:24] tmzt: okay, beyond that I'm trying to do the same parsing with a bookmarklet
[14:24] tmzt: hah, yeah
[14:24] dingomanatee: My hope is  that I can basically allow people to edit chats manually and turn a conversation into a FAQ. 
[14:25] dingomanatee: I was going that way in the beginning but once I was able to get a chunk of time I kind of found that it was enough solution - considering there was other things I wanted to do
[14:25] dingomanatee: adding AI to the mix just didn't seem like it would pay off for my short term goals. 
[14:25] tmzt: edit down to faq/wiki
[14:25] tmzt: sounds good
[14:26] tmzt: I'm getting my context sensitive html editor to work
[14:26] dingomanatee: I'm a big beliver in not coding hard tasks that a human can do easily - provide raw data and crowdsource the parts that are easy for people to do but hard / unreliable for computers to do. 
[14:26] tmzt: it's using css classes as a shortcut to semantic web, which is kind of funny/backwards
[14:26] dingomanatee: interesting.

[14:52] dingomanatee: are you sending a GET or a POST?
[14:52] krazyjakee: it's a large string to be passed
[14:52] krazyjakee: POST
[14:52] krazyjakee: get might work tho
[14:52] dingomanatee: I have POSTed to php websites with node clients. 
[14:52] dingomanatee: POST is best if you want to cram a large string in raw body. 
[14:52] krazyjakee: thats exactly what i wanna do
[14:53] dingomanatee: what is your recipient PHP script? can you gist it?
[14:53] krazyjakee: php-gd image maker
[14:53] krazyjakee: so has to be php
[14:54] krazyjakee: and it's private, not public
[14:54] krazyjakee: so on the system
[14:54] dingomanatee: okay - the first thing I would do is break it apart
[14:54] tmzt: what direction are you going?
[14:54] dingomanatee: just create a PHP script that gets and error-logs raw body.

[15:00] tmzt: there are node bindings for gd aren't there?
[15:00] krazyjakee: use node.js to execute unix command "php file.php stuffffffffff"
[15:00] tmzt: krazyjakee: actually, call fastcgi
[15:00] krazyjakee: is that true?!
[15:00] tmzt: I was thinking about that earlier, doing that for the server side parts of my orm on sql
[15:02] krazyjakee: https://github.com/taggon/node-gd
[15:02] krazyjakee: i'm gonna wait until it's available in npm, because my app is to be installed by noobs

[15:06] bingomanatee: yeah straight CGI calls are fine 
[15:06] bingomanatee: you don't have to go through HTTP if you don't want - argv is enough. 
[15:06] robotarmy has joined the channel
[15:07] krazyjakee: ye think i'll use argv cos just got it working on ma ssh
[15:07] tmzt: what's the possibility that chrome wants a slightly different variant of standard JSON or fails in yet another un productible way
[15:07] bingomanatee: That being said - being able to send binary data directly is sometimes better than cramming it straight into bash. I would reccommend considering a hybrid file based solution: save your binary data to a file and pass the path to said file through to a script.

[15:20] bingomanatee: try harder?
[15:20] tmzt: pretty sure it was about Zend_Db
[15:21] tmzt: I'm looking either for something that works like that on node or I'm going to put some of the REST logic for jobitr on php/zend
[15:21] bingomanatee: ah 
[15:22] bingomanatee: first off I'd look at Doctrine over Zend-DB - I used it - use it - its okay but Doctrine is much more mature as that is ALL it does. 
[15:22] bingomanatee: As for mySQL - honestly when I moved to Node I did 100% of my stuff in Mongo
[15:22] bingomanatee: You should too :D
[15:22] tmzt: for the things I really want to filter or sort, the document-oriented stuff would stay in mongo
[15:22] zemanel: is tim caswell around?
[15:22] bingomanatee: but I know nothing about mySQL in node. 
[15:23] tmzt: hmm, I"m hearing it doesn't work/scale that well, that mysql is still better for memory usage etc.
[15:23] tmzt: also, I want to do m:n relationships which have a few hacky ways of working in mongo
[15:24] tmzt: this is to associate different resumes/templates with different categories
[15:24] tmzt: but that can be hierarchial
[15:24] tmzt: I'll look at Doctrine

[18:57] vandenoever: mraleph: that Buffer is slower for byte arrays than js string

[18:58] vandenoever: yes
[18:58] marcello3d: vandenoever: how were you using them?
[18:59] marcello3d: it's possible that v8 has string optimizations...
[18:59] marcello3d: since Strings are immutable, but Buffers aren't?
[18:59] vandenoever: marcello3d: for unzipping a byte array
[18:59] mraleph: vandenoever: charCodeAt gets nicely inlined.  
[18:59] vandenoever: read in a file with fs.readFile, then calling a deflate algo
[18:59] marcello3d: hmmm

[19:02] vandenoever: helps a lot in fact
[19:02] mraleph: if you grow buffer by 1 — then of course everything will be pretty slow. you should make each next buffer twice as big

[19:03] marcello3d: but yea, if you need it all in memory, what mraleph said (you don't even have to double, just some increasing multiple of the previous size)
[19:04] vandenoever: i went from 1k to 100k :-)
[19:04] AAA_awright: Has anyone worked with http://www.telehash.org/ ? Is it a communication library or distributed storage/hash table, or what?
[19:04] marcello3d: their gradient is tripping me up
[19:04] erabuj has joined the channel
[19:04] mraleph: and buffer performance will become even better when V8 starts inlining a[i] and a[i] = j operations for them...

[19:15] bingomanatee: I suspect the interesting large node projects are still proprietary at this point - express is pretty big but thats the best I can think of. Aria has a log of good stuff in her repo - 
[19:15] AAA_awright: vandenoever: Is that Node.js?
[19:15] micxer has joined the channel
[19:15] vandenoever: AAA_awright: it uses node.js for unit tests
[19:16] AAA_awright: idk if that would qualify as an end user application
[19:16] stagas: jsdom also is pretty big
[19:17] vandenoever: i might add jsdom support to webodf, in that case it enables command-line odf processing with node.js
[19:17] vandenoever: but that's not a target atm, patches are welcome though :-)

[19:37] tmzt: vandenoever: webodf?
[19:37] tmzt: yay so I switched to xhr and it's working in chrome
[19:37] tmzt: marcello3d: it's in the UN resolution, the full name of the country at present
[19:37] vandenoever: tmzt: what about it?
[19:38] marcello3d: what is the full name?
[19:38] tmzt: vandenoever: what is it?
[19:38] tmzt: marcello3d: Lybian Arab Jamilyia or something like that
[19:38] vandenoever: tmzt: javascript library to show odf in the browser and also to edit (in the future)
[19:38] tmzt: odf as in open document?
[19:38] vandenoever: tmzt: yes
[19:38] tmzt: awesome, I'm doing a html+css editor for my site
[19:39] tmzt: I need odf+ooxml support
[19:39] vandenoever: tmzt: well, webodf lets you view odf files with no server side support needed
[19:39] tmzt: mostly I'm going to use xls and generate the stylesheet xml directly
[19:39] tmzt: that's awesome, how does it handle zip?
[19:39] loob2 has joined the channel
[19:39] vandenoever: tmzt: unzips in javascript
[19:39] tmzt: amazing
[19:39] marcello3d: magickal
[19:40] vandenoever: here's a demo: https://demo.webodf.org/demo/
[19:40] vandenoever: over the weekend i changed it so it now uses node's Buffer instead of javascript string
[19:40] marcello3d: The site's security certificate is not trusted! !!!!
[19:41] marcello3d: it's gonna blow!
[19:41] vandenoever: it's not faster, but at least it's cleaner
[19:41] loob2: evenin' - did anyone notice any changes since updating from 4.0 to 4.1 concerning any monkey-patched module code not working anymore?
[19:41] vandenoever: marcello3d: yeah, still have to buy one
[19:41] loob2: it seems that module code requires are in a different scope now
[19:42] boaz_ has joined the channel
[19:42] tmzt: vandenoever: what's the ui toolkit?
[19:43] tmzt: vandenoever: also, Buffer is using NativeBuffer/WebGL?
[19:43] floby has joined the channel
[19:44] vandenoever: tmzt: ext.js in the demo, but webodf has not ui itself, you can use whatever you like
[19:44] vandenoever: tmzt: i'm going to test with nativebuffer now that i have abstracted the bytearray
[19:45] vandenoever: but this abstraction is not committed yet
[19:45] tmzt: that's free ext.js? I'm looking at ajaxorg for my stuff but I'm just using html elements and jquery for now
[19:45] tmzt: d.jobitr.com signup code node1 if you want to see
[19:45] vandenoever: tmzt: yeah gpl version
[19:46] tmzt: trying to do a data centric text editor, it's a little strange, sort of like pages or oo stylist
[19:46] tmzt: but with semantic features
[19:47] vandenoever: tmzt: i'll add rdf support to webodf this month
[19:47] tmzt: rdf?
[19:47] vandenoever: just visualization initually
[19:47] vandenoever: tmzt: yeah, the semantic technology
[19:47] tmzt: ah that
[19:47] vandenoever: rdf == semantic web
[19:47] lgl has joined the channel
[19:47] tmzt: I'm using css classes at the moment, looking at RDF/RDFa
[19:50] tmzt: it would be funny if your stuff was faster than vcl/oo/lo
[19:50] vandenoever: what's vcl?
[19:50] tmzt: the toolkit openoffice.org uses
[19:50] tmzt: it's an abstraction layer to make it cross platform
[19:50] vandenoever: well, it's not much slower atm even though unzip is done in js
[19:51] tmzt: you convert to html or use canvas or something like that?
[19:51] vandenoever: tmzt: no, use ODF xml unchanged
[19:51] tmzt: nah, I mean in the js
[19:51] vandenoever: yes
[19:51] tmzt: I see Style2CSS
[19:52] vandenoever: right, the dom is odf xml, but css 'renders' it
[19:52] tmzt: not worth using XPCOM on firefox for the zip or that only works locally
[19:52] vandenoever: styles.xml from odf is not changed, but 'rendered' to a css stylesheet
[19:52] dyer has joined the channel
[19:52] vandenoever: tmzt: well, that's an optimization i do not currently need
[19:52] tmzt: right, I'm going to have to look into that

[19:53] tmzt: planning to go both ways
[19:53] vandenoever: tmzt: feel free to join #webodf :-)
[19:53] marcello3d: doesn't it make more sense to do server-side unzip?
[19:53] tmzt: sure
[19:53] vandenoever: marcello3d: you can if you want, but i start from the assumption of a dumb server
[19:54] tmzt: what's serving up the filetree to ext?
[19:54] vandenoever: marcello3d: that is, i want this to work with any server, but allow for server-specific optimizations
[19:54] vandenoever: tmzt: parsing index.html
[19:54] mlins_ has joined the channel
[19:54] vandenoever: tmzt: apache
[19:54] marcello3d: got it
[19:54] marcello3d: I don't really know what I'm looking at here :)
[19:54] tmzt: webdav would be cool, but I get the agnosticism
[19:54] tmzt: either way this is awesome
[19:55] Spion has joined the channel
[19:55] vandenoever: tmzt: yes, webdav for writing is the aim, however, writing binary is not supported in all/most browsers
[19:55] tmzt: no, even websocket will be using a ascii 7bit encoding
[19:55] jetienne has joined the channel
[19:56] marcello3d: websocket uses 7bit? lame
[19:56] vandenoever: which is horrible imho, why not support binary PUT, it would be nice and KISS
[19:57] tmzt: marcello3d: they had a problem with some kind of proxy that might be in between the browser and the ws server
[19:57] tmzt: marcello3d: that might interpret random messages and allow cache poisoning
[19:58] tmzt: marcello3d: so they implemented masking of some sort, I forget if they wen with 7bit or just use crypto, but the framing is very tricky
[19:59] tmzt: vandenoever: hmm, can you use xhr PUT for the writing or is that what doesn't support binary?
[19:59] jetienne: asap i understand why i cant update update github pages, you will get websocket simple. with 25ms ping :)
[20:00] vandenoever: tmzt: first of all, PUT is not supported by all browsers, and second, binary is often cropped to 7bit
[20:00] marcello3d: jetienne: what?
[20:00] brapse has joined the channel
[20:00] vandenoever: even binary GET is not supported in all XHR impls
[20:01] jetienne: marcello3d: i ported http://easywebsocket.org to websocket. http://easywebsocket.org/contrib/monitor/ will provide 10times better results very shortly
[20:01] marcello3d: how does that compare to socket.io?
[20:02] jetienne: marcello3d: this is socket.io in the backround
[20:02] jetienne: marcello3d: but 25ms ping is only for websocket
[20:03] marcello3d: ah

[20:15] marcello3d: hmm, doesn't seem much better than before
[20:15] marcello3d: never drops below 133 now (was 100 before?)
[20:15] marcello3d: or maybe I'm confused by the graph
