[00:00] rhdoenges: I'm just trying to write a local one. The FB realtime api requires me to set up a domain for them to push to.
[00:01] rhdoenges: I'm trying to do something similar to https://github.com/jugyo/earthquake
[00:01] rhdoenges: but for facebook.

[00:02] rhdoenges: :'(

[00:02] micheil: rhdoenges: try using localtunnel?
[00:03] Jakwac has joined the channel
[00:03] micheil: rhdoenges: also, as for the realtime graph API, it requires people authorize your app, and you have to request for offline access
[00:05] Pathin_ has joined the channel
[00:05] rhdoenges: micheil: localtunnel might be useful. I'll use your library if I decide to use the realtime api.
[00:05] micheil: I wouldn't recommend using polling.
[00:06] brimster has joined the channel
[00:07] rhdoenges: localtunnel looks manageable, actually.
[00:07] rhdoenges: it'll just eat up cpu, right?
[00:07] rhdoenges: (polling, that is)
[00:08] micheil: it'll eat up bandwidth and cpu cycles, yes
[00:09] micheil: hmm.. time to figure out how to build a HTTP long-poll server

[02:52] isaacs: Feel free to contact us if you have any questions: support@iriscouch.com
[02:52] marcello3d: ok, yea, I just updated from npm@1.0.6 to 1.0.15 and now I'm getting that error
[02:52] marcello3d: what's the "right" way to update npm?
[02:52] isaacs: marcello3d: curl | sh
[02:52] marcello3d: I feel like it's great at updating your modules, but not so great at updating itself :)
[02:52] isaacs: marcello3d: should work fine in 1.0.14 and higher
[02:53] marcello3d: yea, the lack of security of that approach bothers me slightly
[02:53] marcello3d: so now I've just git cloned the https repo and installing it with sudo make install
[02:54] marcello3d: what does that error mean though, is that my npm client, the npm registry, or couch, or?

[04:17] Pathin_ has joined the channel
[04:17] isaacs: SubStack: so, what i need to do is walk through it following the "friends" strings as if they were links to root[that-string]
[04:18] SubStack: isaacs: nope, you'll have to write something yourself
[04:18] SubStack: oh wait
[04:19] SubStack: you could transform them such that they actually are links back to the relevant node
[04:19] isaacs: yeah, but i don't want them to be
[04:19] isaacs: because i want to be able to send just one or two of them over dnode without having dnode send the full census bureau every time
[04:19] isaacs: you might have like 100 of these spanning the globe or something
[04:19] isaacs: millions, even
[04:19] isaacs: on every stopwatch
[04:20] SubStack: isaacs: dnode knows how to send cyclical references
[04:20] SubStack: also you can transform something without modifying the original
[04:21] isaacs: SubStack: right, but if you have :  a = {}; b = {a:a}; and send b without sending a?
[04:21] isaacs: i might just have to write something to do bfs/dfs following the strings
[04:21] SubStack: why wouldn't that work?
[04:21] SubStack: I don't see what the problem is
[04:22] isaacs: so, if you have a cyclic object, you end up sending the whole cycle.  i wanna not send "friends" when i send one of those records.
[04:22] isaacs: but do send the strings.
[04:23] isaacs: so i can either transform the data structure into something else to walk it, or just deal with it.  i'm gonna just deal with it, i think.
[04:23] SubStack: seems like you can just write a few transforms
[04:25] isaacs: Object.keys(society).forEach(function (r) { r.friends = r.friends.reduce(function (friends, f) { friends[f] = society[f]; return friends }) })

[08:06] niftylettuce: Nuck: want a screenshot?
[08:06] deoxxa: Nuck: in your use of mongodb-native, have you encountered any issues regarding specifying a field list?
[08:06] deoxxa: that seems to be where i'm coming undone
[08:06] Nuck: deoxxa: Honestly, I cannot figure out what the fuck you're doing.  You're using functions which aren't in mine.
[08:07] deoxxa: really? ._.
[08:07] Nuck: VERY yes.
[08:07] deoxxa: such as?
[08:07] Nuck: niftylettuce: And to you too
[08:07] Nuck: deoxxa: getCollection, getClient
[08:07] Nuck: I do client.open
[08:07] Nuck: And db.collection
[08:07] deoxxa: getClient is related to mongo-pool
[08:07] Nuck: ah
[08:07] Nuck: No clue what that is.
[08:08] Nuck: But perhaps that's fucking you in the ass?
[08:08] deoxxa: getCollection is regular old mongodb-native though
[08:08] deoxxa: don't think so, everything else seems to operate fine
[08:08] deoxxa: seems to be a very specific thing to break
[08:08] Nuck: deoxxa: Must be a synonym there

[08:09] sudhirjonathan has joined the channel
[08:09] niftylettuce: Nuck: I need utils, i triedn pm install utils and not work?
[08:09] niftylettuce: tried npm*
[08:09] niftylettuce: Nuck: is npm down
[08:09] Nuck: niftylettuce: That's because utils isn't a module
[08:10] Nuck: ACTION snickers
[08:10] deoxxa: because connection establishment would be like 50% of my request time for the most part
[08:10] niftylettuce: Nuck: oh boy
[08:10] deoxxa: does mongodb-native do pooling on its own..?
[08:10] Nuck: deoxxa: No, but couldn't you just have a single connection OUTSIDE the HTTP server?
[08:11] mhauri has joined the channel
[08:11] Nuck: And then have it get teh connection established before starting your HTTP server?
[08:11] Nuck: niftylettuce: utils is part of Node.
[08:11] deoxxa: i could, but then i'd only be able to run one query at a time, no?
[08:12] deoxxa: i.e. there's no query multiplexing in mongo's wire protocol as far as i know
[08:12] Nuck: deoxxa: I don't know, actually.  That's a good question.  But with Node's async setup, it shouldn't cause any major problems.
[08:12] Nuck: It can send off the query and wait for a response
[08:12] Nuck: And send another one first
[08:12] Nuck: I'm not bothering with my website, TBH.
[08:13] deoxxa: ah, but you see, then i end up pegging one core at 100% and the other 15 get to sit around chilling
[08:13] Nuck: deoxxa: What?  It'll be that way no matter what
[08:13] Nuck: That's how Node works
[08:13] Nuck: It's single-core
[08:13] deoxxa: node isn't where most of the work is being done
[08:14] deoxxa: most of the processing is happening inside mongodb
[08:14] deoxxa: i.e. node is pretty much just providing a thin http layer into mongodb, not doing a ton of processing on its own
[08:15] Nuck: deoxxa: So one request to the database is stuck on one core?
[08:15] Pathin_ has joined the channel
[08:15] Nuck: Well, I dunno then.

[08:15] deoxxa: noted
[08:15] xeodox has joined the channel
[08:16] deoxxa: the reason i'm using the callbacks for getCollection etc is so i can get proper error messages should anything go wrong

[08:16] niftylettuce: Nuck:  :)!
[08:18] Nuck: deoxxa: Why would you NOT use callbacks?  Are you new to async?
[08:19] deoxxa: you... were suggesting just before that i not use getCollection et al
[08:19] deoxxa: so i can pose the same question to you
[08:19] Nuck: I was suggesting using regualr mongo-native
[08:19] jacobolus has joined the channel

[08:19] Nuck: deoxxa: Not from what I can tell :/
[08:20] MichealBenedict_ has joined the channel
[08:20] Nuck: deoxxa: And I suggest using the async form of collection.find
[08:20] deoxxa: ok, imagine that instead of mongo.getClient(function(client) { ... }); it's (new Db(...)).open(function(client) { ... });
[08:21] Nuck: deoxxas: The not using async could be a problem too
[08:21] Nuck: At line 128
[08:21] Nuck: You should ALWAYS use async.
[08:21] low-b has joined the channel
[08:22] Nuck: I didn't even know mongodb-native could do non-async, but I should slap christkv for it.
[08:22] deoxxa: that is async
[08:22] deoxxa: cursor.toArray is when the database call is made
[08:22] fr0stbyte has joined the channel
[08:22] deoxxa: because it calls cursor.each which calls cursor.nextObject etc etc
[08:23] deoxxa: the if (!cursor) { ... } part just catches possible construction errors
[08:24] Nuck: deoxxa: This is not.
[08:24] Nuck: "var cursor = collection.find(report.query, report.fields, {});"

[08:26] deoxxa: the one in toArray(function() { ... });
[08:26] deoxxa: line 139
[08:26] deoxxa: it simply never fires
[08:27] deoxxa: despite getting to that point just fine
[08:27] Nuck: deoxxa: I assume you checked by putting some indicator at the start of that function, to make sure it's not some of the code within it?
[08:27] deoxxa: yep
[08:27] mikeal has joined the channel
[08:27] deoxxa: https://github.com/christkv/node-mongodb-native/blob/master/lib/mongodb/cursor.js#L112 << throwing some debug statements in here at various places points to .each not working as it should
[08:28] `3rdEden has joined the channel
[08:29] Nuck: deoxxa: Looking at that, there's no place it could die and NOT send back to your callback.
[08:29] deoxxa: exactly
[08:29] deoxxa: and here i am
[08:30] deoxxa: with that callback not firing
[08:30] Nuck: You need somebody way better at this than I am.  Like, you need a crazy-ass professional.
[08:30] Nuck: Hell, you need christkv.
[08:30] deoxxa: perhaps so
[08:30] deoxxa: unfortunately however, in around 12 hours this is being demoed to a client :(
[08:31] deoxxa: thanks, marketing department
[08:31] Nuck: deoxxa: Only thing I can think of is that perhaps the .toArray function isn't being called?
[08:31] Nuck: But by the sounds of it you already checkeD?
[08:31] deoxxa: nope, i put a bunch of console.log()'s in there
[08:31] deoxxa: and it definitely gets called
[08:31] deoxxa: then as soon as it hits the .each part, it goes dead
[08:32] deoxxa: i think there's something very far down that's broken in a very subtle way
[08:32] Nuck: deoxxa: Did you check the each function?
[08:32] deoxxa: not yet
[08:33] deoxxa: figured i was doing something obvious that was wrong
[08:33] deoxxa: this discussion has lead me to believe the exactly opposite though
[08:33] Nuck: deoxxa: I suggest just keep digging deeper with the logging and you'll eventually find it.

[09:35] sorensen: is this out of lack of something else to do?
[09:36] sorensen: im amused by it, but cant think of any possible reason to use it
[09:36] niftylettuce: no its because I haven't done anything truly "fun" and for myself before

[10:01] Nuck: No parens after nyancat
[10:01] niftylettuce: Nuck: what about function nyancat() {...}
[10:01] niftylettuce: Nuck: I need the ()
[10:01] Nuck: niftylettuce: because you're defining it.
[10:01] niftylettuce: Nuck: but when I run with setInterval(nyancat, 3000); I get no output, but if i just run nyancat(); i do?
[10:02] Nuck: niftylettuce: Did you wait 3 seconds?
[10:02] niftylettuce: Nuck: yes
[10:03] niftylettuce: Nuck: okay so when I just do nyancat; it doesnt give me any output
[10:03] niftylettuce: Nuck: but if I take off the function() wrapper it works
[10:03] niftylettuce: Nuck: as soon as I wrap it with a function it effs
[10:03] Nuck: niftylettuce: gist the code, sounds like a minor syntax error
[10:04] Mrfloyd has joined the channel
[10:06] Wizek has joined the channel
[10:09] niftylettuce: Nuck: I should just have the function call itself once its done
[10:09] Nuck: niftylettuce: That could work, in theory.
[10:11] niftylettuce: Nuck: if I have nyancat() {...} and call nyancat() outside of it
[10:11] niftylettuce: Nuck: it still f's
[10:12] Nuck: niftylettuce: gist it, it's prolly a tiny mistake in syntax
[10:14] niftylettuce: Nuck: i just made a public repo

[17:38] junkee[]: `3rdEden: nice ;)
[17:38] isaacs: onr: npm update
[17:38] `3rdEden: saschagehlich okay I'll get started on authenticion per namespace now:)
[17:38] isaacs: onr: or npm update -g to update the global ones.  if you're on npm <1.0.13, you should reinstall npm first (this is fixed now)
[17:39] saschagehlich: didn't try the authentication stuff yet
[17:39] `3rdEden: saschagehlich it's pretty handy if you have realtime stuff in a dashboard that only logged in users are allowed to access
[17:40] onr: isaacs: ah, thank you
[17:40] `3rdEden: and per namespace auth would allow you to have a dedicated namespace for admin stuff, you might want to stream im real time stats on your webpage if you are logged in as `developer` for example
[17:41] isaacs: onr: you can also specify a package name to just update instances of that thing
[17:41] isaacs: onr: ie, npm update connect

[23:31] tauren: dnunes: but timestamps don't deal with timezone offsets at all. so i'd have to include another json attribute for timezone. and some rest endpoints don't give dates in timestamp format.

[23:32] tauren: I'm getting dates like '2011-06-04T05:08:00+08:00' (ISO8601 format)

[23:32] Ravatar: this script extends the Date object for better formatting
[23:32] Ravatar: http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/date-time-format
[23:32] dnunes: tauren: You can serialize the dates always on UTC. But you're right about having to keep another "control" variable to undo the timezone convertion.
[23:33] tauren: Ravatar: have you used that script, or did you just google and find it?

[23:33] Ravatar: i needed something similar and had a stackoverflow bookmark that referenced it
[23:33] Ravatar: did you search there?
[23:34] tauren: ok, thanks
[23:34] tauren: i've looked on SO for client-side handling a while back 
[23:34] tauren: i should look again for node specific date libraries
[23:35] xerox: tauren: please share your findings
[23:35] xerox: :)

[23:36] niftylettuce: https://github.com/mockko/livereload does something like this exist for node?
[23:36] Ravatar: you could just module-ize this http://www.datejs.com/
[23:36] dnunes: niftylettuce: You have some "monitors", like nodemon.
[23:37] dnunes: niftylettuce: I'm using forever + a custom-built python script to monitor my files in the current project, but nodemon seems nice.
[23:37] Ravatar: in fact: https://github.com/kcbanner/datejs
[23:37] Prometheus: niftylettuce: I've actually wondered that also
[23:37] niftylettuce: I dont need to restart server
[23:37] niftylettuce: only refresh browser
[23:37] Prometheus: niftylettuce: it'd be easy enough to create one, if it doesn't

[23:38] dnunes: niftylettuce: Are you changing server code and refreshing the browser?
[23:38] Prometheus: niftylettuce: I believe livereload just uses websockets

[23:38] Prometheus: when it detects a change in the file hierarchy its watching, it sends a refresh to the browser
[23:38] niftylettuce: well im also looking to try to find a way to do live Styl editing in Chrome
[23:38] niftylettuce: but it seems easiest solution is just an auto-refresh on .styl or .js file changes
[23:38] Prometheus: niftylettuce: might want to watch http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8SS-rUEZPg :>
[23:39] Prometheus: oh
[23:39] Prometheus: nvm then
[23:39] dnunes: niftylettuce: If you need to refresh your browser, you don't need a solution for node. There are already some projects that refresh scripts/styles upon changes.
[23:39] niftylettuce: Prometheus: yea i stay up to date with irish's work
[23:39] Prometheus: dnunes: well he did point to one right there :)
[23:39] Prometheus: there's also xrefresh which is pretty much the same thing

[23:41] tauren: Ravatar: I've used DateJS before client-side, but had some issues with it. the primary one being that it is enormous.
[23:41] niftylettuce: I wonder if tjholowaychuk has thought of live .styl editing in chrome
[23:42] niftylettuce: or a listener for css changes to do "styl -C $style.css $style.styl
[23:42] Prometheus: niftylettuce: it probably has a watch
[23:42] Prometheus: command*
[23:42] niftylettuce: Prometheus: oh it does, but i mean for live editing
[23:42] Prometheus: live editing?
[23:42] DTrejo has joined the channel
[23:42] Prometheus: just hook up livereload or xrefresh + watch command and you're set
[23:42] niftylettuce: live edit CSS and it auto saves/converts to Styl
[23:42] Prometheus: it's not "instant"
[23:42] Prometheus: oh
[23:42] niftylettuce: might save some time
[23:42] Prometheus: dunno, seems more trouble than it's worth
[23:43] Prometheus: seems like*
[23:43] Prometheus: there's no autosaving for chrome's dev tools anyway
[23:43] Prometheus: (they specifically said that in the presentation)
[23:43] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[23:45] niftylettuce: Prometheus: yeah i thought it didn't exist and just confirmed
[23:46] niftylettuce: http://open-juve.blogspot.com/2011/06/connect-gedit-to-firebug.html i wonder if this could be ported to chrome fairly easily
[23:47] niftylettuce: Prometheus: you can right click "Save As" though
[23:47] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[23:48] niftylettuce: Prometheus: from resources tab in inspector
[23:48] Prometheus: niftylettuce: yes, but that is manual
[23:48] Prometheus: you can't do it automagically
[23:48] Prometheus: i.e. you can't say "Save on change"
[23:49] Prometheus: niftylettuce: I'm not really sure what you are trying to get at, though
[23:50] Prometheus: I think it's far easier to just edit the stylus/sass/less files on your local machine via your favorite editor while running a watch command on the files and livereload on the dirs 
[23:50] Prometheus: I usually don't edit things from the browser, or if I do, I just copy them over without always saving the file 
[23:51] Prometheus: I don't see why you would want to copy the whole screen.css (or what have you) file over and convert it
[23:51] Prometheus: you'd just lose hierarchy
[23:51] niftylettuce: Prometheus: yeah
