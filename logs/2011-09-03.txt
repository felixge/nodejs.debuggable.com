[00:28] dragnl0rd: got a (possibly easy) question.  Trying to send the contents of a css file to a browser via readstream.  However, even though the end event is being fired on the response object, the browser isn't always seeing the end of the response, and is hanging as a result.  
[00:28] zomgbie has joined the channel
[00:28] dragnl0rd: Any clue what could cause this?  (and I'm checking to see if the write buffer is full in case I need to pause until the response.drain event fires)

[00:32] Marak: are there any good SMTP as a service providers who will receive emails for you and then pipe them out as HTTP webhooks somewhere? 
[00:33] maushu: Marak, doesn't a http api work?
[00:33] Marak: maushu: how you send an email to a url? i forgot
[00:33] maushu: mailto: ?
[00:33] Marak: :-D
[00:33] dragnl0rd: @maushu I was... but given the current behavior I switched to using the long form.  
[00:34] maushu: Marak, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailto check this out for more options, like subject, message and stuff

[00:34] maushu: How would that work.
[00:34] Marak: thats what i was asking you maushu 
[00:35] Marak: are there any good SMTP as a service providers who will receive emails for you and then pipe them out as HTTP webhooks somewhere? 
[00:35] edude03: Marak I think sendgrid can do that

[00:35] tg has joined the channel
[00:35] Marak: edude03: i thought sendgrid only did the reverse
[00:35] maushu: Ok, receive emails, check. Get emails using http api, check. I don't see the problem or why use "http webhooks".
[00:36] balupton has joined the channel
[00:36] edude03: Yeah it might be the opposite 
[00:36] dragnl0rd: I'm only using a stream now because I figured that would be more manageable for serving static content like css files than using buffers.
[00:36] Marak: edude03: im debating using hakara

[00:36] Marak: i really dont want to host SMTP servers though, it feels wrong
[00:36] edude03: Never heard of it, what are you trying to do though?
[00:36] Marak: get emails, perform node.js code
[00:36] jerrysv: marak: coming in late, but maybe some sort of imap/pop middleware?
[00:36] Marak: get emails, perform node.js code

[00:38] jerrysv: maushu: smtp is a protocol for sending *and* receiving emails -- what happens after the smtp server receives it isn't defined
[00:39] maushu: I though you used pop3 to receive emails. Unless it uses smtp before hand.
[00:39] maushu: What a confusing transport.
[00:39] Marak: maushu: just use mailto:
[00:39] dragnl0rd: maybe a better question:  what is the best way to serve css, js, and image files to a browser?
[00:39] Marak: dragnl0rd: use a static server
[00:39] maushu: dragnl0rd, a http server.
[00:39] dragnl0rd: got that
[00:39] jerrysv: maushu: pop/imap are transports to retrieve email from mailboxes to clients
[00:39] Marak: dragnl0rd: https://github.com/nodejitsu/http-server
[00:39] dragnl0rd: okay
[00:39] NinjaSex: dragnl0rd: Stick them on s3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[00:39] jerrysv: maushu: the mail has to get to the mailbox somehow
[00:40] NinjaSex: <Satan> I would use S3.
[00:40] dragnl0rd: assume that isn't an option for now.
[00:40] dragnl0rd: I have an http server
[00:40] dragnl0rd: it is trying to serve static content
[00:40] jerrysv: dragnl0rd: npm install -g bricks
[00:40] dragnl0rd: sometimes it succesfully comletes the response
[00:40] jerrysv: dragnl0rd: cd to directory
[00:40] dragnl0rd: other times it doesn't.
[00:40] jerrysv: dragnl0rd: type "bricks"
[00:41] maushu: Marak, so, what you need is a email web service that supports smtp and pop3/imap.
[00:41] Marak: maushu: pretty much
[00:41] maushu: Maybe http://www.fastmail.fm/
[00:41] jerrysv: dragnl0rd: or there are 100 other static webservers that will do the same thing

[00:44] dragnl0rd: the http server is written.  I'm just trying to figure out why sometimes the response.end() event doesn't cause the browser to consistently see the file.  (also, I'm using the fs.createReadStream to ensure I'm not trying to write entire files at once).
[00:44] jerrysv: v8bot is case sensitive now?
[00:44] NinjaSex: Marak, you are so awesome you must be an avid Madonna fan.

[00:53] sorensen: wheres the 234 votes commin from if no videos
[00:53] sorensen: what i doing wrong

[01:36] Nuck: chapel: I did it through the require + function wrapping method
[01:36] chapel: umm, wrapping is possible, how else would you require the file?
[01:36] Nuck: Then I switched to globals
[01:36] Nuck: And now things are way better
[01:36] chapel: not better
[01:36] chapel: easier
[01:37] Nuck: The code is way more maintainable
[01:37] chapel: if you say so
[01:37] chapel: its your code
[01:37] Nuck: It's actually not passing variables through 12 files to get to a specific endpoint
[01:37] chapel: but remind me never to use anything you make
[01:37] Nuck: chapel: I never use globals if I can avoid it.
[01:37] matyr_ has joined the channel
[01:37] Nuck: But in this case, I need something a whole team can work on, something extendable, etc.
[01:37] chapel: you can avoid it here, but you would rather have less code it seems

[01:38] chapel: its useless though, he has made his decision
[01:38] Nuck: sorensen: Not really
[01:38] sorensen: if you had an explicit passing of the db a dev would instantly know whats going wrong
[01:38] Nuck: IT's the same as if I shoved everything in one file
[01:38] Nuck: sorensen: If my devs don't know that db or app is global, they can expect to be fired.
[01:38] Nuck: :I
[01:38] sorensen: i use my main app.js to pass in all requirements to each of the files

[01:40] Nuck: Honestly, I just want a multi-file setup where everything acts like if I had it in one file.  Because if doing a single file weren't so unwieldy, I'd be doing that.
[01:40] sorensen: i'm still giggling about "if my dev dont know about the globals i give them, they're fired"
[01:41] sorensen: must be a small program
[01:41] sorensen: or a small team
[01:41] sorensen: have you considered the scalability of such things?
[01:41] Nuck: sorensen: It's two globals
[01:41] sorensen: or do you write wiki's about the globals you throw around
[01:41] sorensen: and thats just the start!
[01:41] sorensen: soon it will be 20
[01:41] Nuck: I only global'd what should be global.
[01:41] sorensen: and then 30
[01:42] Nuck: I will not go over 5, max
[01:42] sorensen: what if you have 5 different DB connections?
[01:42] Nuck: I see no reason to have more globals than the bare minimum to do that
[01:42] sorensen: ;)
[01:42] Nuck: sorensen: Then I'll do pooling
[01:42] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[01:42] sorensen: you'd do all that work just to avoid NOT having globals

[03:36] skunkape: i'm running this on linux

[04:20] Sri_: astropirate: thanks
[04:20] astropirate: and setup a load balancer such as nginx infront of them 
[04:20] skunkape: Sri_, more comprehensive solution will also include a replication filesystem and also database replication.
[04:20] AvianFlu: nginx?
[04:20] AvianFlu: http://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy
[04:21] skunkape: I would go with HA proxy
[04:21] chjj: Sri_: node's concurrency can be seen as limiting when you take into account the fact that IO might not be the only thing blocking for a considerably long amount of time
[04:21] astropirate: AvianFlu, http://wiki.nginx.org/
[04:21] AvianFlu: I know what it is XD
[04:21] astropirate: :D
[04:21] chjj: Sri_: other than that, i dont see any problem with how node handles concurrency, i like it
[04:21] astropirate: AvianFlu, have you used both?  do yhou recommend one over the other?
[04:22] Sri_: skunkape: yes, i believe mongodb replicates well and lets you avoid the filesystem 
[04:22] AvianFlu: nginx won't proxy websockets out of the box... that's one consideration
[04:22] AvianFlu: for others, please go do benchmarks and share them with the rest of us
[04:22] skunkape: Yes, but HAproxy will. And it will transparently proxy ssl too

[04:23] AvianFlu: likewise with node-http-proxy :)

[05:18] mikeal has joined the channel
[05:19] CoverSlide: it is possible
[05:19] blkcat: Ritz: sure, why not? :)
[05:19] dmkbot: joyent/node: chowey: http.js parser uses "this" and fails - https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/1614
[05:19] Ritz: So, why should I prefer it over IRC or XMPP like protocols?
[05:20] CoverSlide: umm node isn't a protocol
[05:20] CoverSlide: you can implement irc or xmpp through node
[05:20] Ritz: Node.JS is written in JS and I understand that it is interpreted rather than compiled
[05:21] tuhoojabotti: Ritz: IRC<3
[05:21] ttilley: Ritz: also, why write an IM service when it's been done to death and someone else has already done the hard work?
[05:21] Ritz: So it would produce a slower running server? Correct me if I am wrong
[05:22] tuhoojabotti: Ritz: It is interpreted, but v8 does some wild stuff like hidden classes and assembly to optimized it, like black magic.
[05:22] tuhoojabotti: :)
[05:22] balaa has joined the channel
[05:22] chjj: Ritz: actually it is technically a JIT, thus technically compiled, v8 doesnt have an interpreter or a byte code language, javascript gets compiled directly to opcodes :)
[05:22] Ritz: @ttilley, well the ultimate aim is not IM, but some services which run over IM
[05:22] ttilley: Ritz: it's a bit more complicated than that. node.js uses google v8, which is a badass runtime for javascript that allows for optimizations that one normally can only perform on static code. things are JIT'd
[05:22] ttilley: 3 answers at the same time for that one
[05:22] ttilley: nice
[05:22] tuhoojabotti: Yay
[05:23] tuhoojabotti: My answer is the best, yours even has some facts.
[05:23] tuhoojabotti: ;)
[05:24] tuhoojabotti: Ritz: Use some protocol for IM like IRC and then build an IRC bot for the service? :D
[05:24] zinkem has joined the channel
[05:24] tuhoojabotti: Or create IRC server with node and add additional server commands, or something.
[05:25] ttilley: Ritz: ok. then you probably want to know more about node.js libraries for interfacing with XMPP and go from there. i assure you, it'll be lightning fast and pleasant to work with. just keep in mind the evented nature of node and that the only thing blocking the runtime is your own code (or, in another way: write small functions and use events ;)
[05:25] ttilley: Ritz: http://search.npmjs.org/
[05:26] tuhoojabotti: Yeah.
[05:26] Ritz: well so I understand that Node.js would give a better or comparable performance than C / C++
[05:27] CoverSlide: that all depends on how you code it
[05:27] CoverSlide: a well-written Node program will probably perform better than a badly written C / C++ program
[05:27] Ritz: well, yeah it depends on code efficiency but considering similar code written in both languages
[05:27] ttilley: Ritz: http://search.npmjs.org/#/node-xmpp appears to be a more commonly used xmpp library
[05:28] CoverSlide: of course, C /C++ are closer to the metal, so there will be better performance on that end
[05:28] tuhoojabotti: And I'm late for school. :u
[05:28] CoverSlide: but it's the matter if you actually want to write thousands of lines of C / C++ code or hundreds of JavaScript code
[05:28] ttilley: Ritz: errrr.... a program that handles a lot of IO will do better in node, while a program that's pure computation might do better in something else. 
[05:29] Ritz: Hmm, I get it
[05:29] tuhoojabotti: Ritz: One of the key awesomeness in node is that you can basically copy-paste code from client-side js to server-side without too much effort.
[05:30] CoverSlide: and of course you'd have to write all the event handling, socket stuff yourself in C
[05:30] ttilley: Ritz: there's a reason behind the benefits provided by node.js, and IMHO it's largely that javascript is a language that people are used to being event-oriented and that meshes well with handling async I/O
[05:30] tuhoojabotti: JS = ES = Pure love.
[05:32] davidbanham has joined the channel
[05:32] daed: what about coffeescript?
[05:32] tuhoojabotti: But now, school.
[05:32] Ritz: Yes, and from what I have found about NodeJS, I suppose the effort required would be much less than coding the same thing in C
[05:32] daed: (i've spent all night in the cs repl) ;/
[05:32] tuhoojabotti: Ritz: Well duh, people have done the work for you, just use npm install program and run it. ;D
[05:32] tuhoojabotti: ->
[05:32] ttilley: Ritz: random example. i had a list of a few tens of thousands of sites. i needed to resolve them all to IPs to ensure that they still existed as valid, resolvable, domain names. my quick ruby script for this took 3 days. my quick node.js script for this took less than 10 minutes.
[05:33] ttilley: Ritz: but that was a direct result of async DNS resolution and being able to fire off each request for each domain at the same time and just wait for results.
[05:34] Ritz: yes, that is what attracts me to node.js

[05:36] eminion has joined the channel
[05:36] ttilley: i shouldn't have to add special case code where i resolve a KNOWN unresolvable domain name, get its IP, and then compare against it every other resolution to know whether or not comcast is dicking around with the results

[05:48] slickplaid: my phones are Google voice, routed voip to landline in my house. All tv I download/netflix or watch online.
[05:49] Nuck: And that set the stage for Android

[06:07] Nuck: chjj: Well, it's also not loaded everything yet :P
[06:08] chjj: no, i can use it pretty heavily for maybe an hour or two

[08:16] lwes: yeah, found that as well… but funny thing is, I'm not doing adduser or anything
[08:16] kuebk^: what's the best way to disable chunked encoding?
[08:16] kuebk^: I tried http.useChunkedEncodingByDefault= false
[08:17] kuebk^: and on instance of http.createServer
[08:17] kuebk^: but it still gives me chunked response
[08:17] lwes: japj: btw - I don't have any .npmrc or /etc/npmrc files lying around...

[08:17] japj: lwes: anyway 1.0.27 is the current latest npm version. don't know if upgrading to the latest will help you
[08:19] lwes: japj: thanks, I'll try...
[08:19] lwes: japj: might also be a server issue, seems to have issues resolving registry.npmjs.org
[08:20] japj: ah
[08:20] japj: works ok for me here
[08:21] lwes: jep, also works ok here (dev machine), so seems to be the server, sorry for that, should have checked that earlier, but thanks for your help
[08:21] japj: k, np
[08:23] japj: kuebk^:  which version of node are you using?
[08:23] kuebk^: 0.5.5
[08:24] kuebk^: setting content-length header helped
[08:24] zomgbie has joined the channel
[08:25] japj: kuebk^: could you try also with --use-http1 ? there is a new http library in 0.5.x, maybe you found a bug in it
[08:28] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[08:28] japj: kuebk^: ah, http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs/browse_thread/thread/e07c9899b0636e21/e1256ae18b7e18f7 'useChunkedEncodingByDefault' isn't documented  and  The only way to avoid chunked encoding is to supply a content-length header.
[08:29] kuebk^: afair earlier it was working
[08:29] kuebk^: but i'm not sure

[09:14] franck34: ho thx
[09:15] franck34: so in fact when i console.log(myBuffer), it's the same thing but without \x ..
[09:15] franck34: is \u the same thing ?
[09:15] franck34: \xXX != \uXXXX ?
[09:17] franck34: i've never worked with buffer and ... bytebuffer. I'm trying to reverse a browser client code lib into a node lib, with pain. If somebody got few minutes to loose with me, should be really appreciable

[18:15] jamesd has joined the channel
[18:16] ScottR4: I'm having trouble adapting a browser math library to node; one of the lines in the library is arrayType = Float32Array || Array, and node pitches a fit over Float32Array. How do I make node evaluate missing references as "falsy" values?
[18:17] jbpros has joined the channel
[18:18] TheJH: ScottR4, maybe global.Float32Array?

[18:56] DrMcKay: maybe a patch git applies without recursive merge?
[18:56] tuhoojabotti: No idea.
[18:57] errordeveloper: in fact I have to say that now I quite like js as a language

[19:12] errordeveloper: thinkjson: I don't know what's AMQP
[19:13] thinkjson: errordeveloper:  the protocol behind ZeroMQ, as well as a host of other solutions
[19:13] errordeveloper: ah .. is it a class of things that 0mq belongs to ?
[19:13] errordeveloper: ok
[19:13] thinkjson: I've messed around with RabbitMQ, but the underlying concepts are the same

[19:19] thinkjson: I should totally put that on mine before I send it out next week

[19:21] DrMcKay: jesusabdullah: and a big penis on first page?
[19:21] jesusabdullah: It occurs to me that, if I keep this up that "proficient with MS Office" is going to be a lie pretty soon

[19:23] errordeveloper: or something similar to that
[19:23] jesusabdullah: Yeah
[19:23] tuhoojabotti: I prefer to stay silent.
[19:23] thinkjson: errordeveloper: the advantage of AMQP is language support
[19:23] thinkjson: you can use it from almost anything
[19:23] errordeveloper: I see ..
[19:23] thinkjson: MPI doesn't have that kind of broad appeal
[19:23] hekkwan has joined the channel
[19:23] jesusabdullah: Hopefully I won't have to apply for a job whose major requirement is MS Office proficiency ever again
[19:24] tuhoojabotti: I used MS Excel
[19:24] errordeveloper: I can imagine that MPI is bound to C 
[19:24] thinkjson: if you're doing low-level distributed computing in C or C++ then MPI is probably the best choice
[19:24] jesusabdullah: I mean, it's fine if that's what the office uses, but having to actually CHECK for PROFICIENCY in a WORD PROCESSOR?
[19:24] jesusabdullah: or, spreadsheets
[19:24] jesusabdullah: I'm pretty bomb at spreadsheets :P
[19:24] thinkjson: if you want to do queueing of tasks for the modern web, I would use an AMQP solution
[19:24] tuhoojabotti: I'm pretty good at scripting in excel!

[20:16] TooTallNate: thanks guys
[20:17] austinbv: TooTallNate:  first you want to extract everything in the {}
[20:18] austinbv: so a simple regex like {(.*)} where you pull out all matches
[20:18] DrMcKay: Insekticid: I've seen this one
[20:18] austinbv: now take any thing that desnt match and split it one sec and I will put it in a fiddle
[20:18] Insekticid: DrMcKay: And what do you think? May be interesting.

[21:16] blup: probably a stupid question... if i do require(./utils.js), which contains several exports, is there a way to have them available without the 'utils.'?

[21:18] blup: TheJH, i know that one, but then i have a lot of exports (string manipulations, etc)...

[21:18] TheJH: !coffee compile {foo, bar} = require('utils')
[21:18] jhbot: var bar, foo, _ref; _ref = require('utils'), foo = _ref.foo, bar = _ref.bar;
[21:19] blup: TheJH: ok, thanks. i was hoping there was a shorter way without declaring all the functions.
[21:19] kon_: just for completeness: '"origin"{CGPoint="x"d"y"d}"size"{CGSize="width"d"height"d}'.split(/^"|"?([^{}]*}|{[^}]*}+)"?/).filter(Boolean) =)

[21:35] DrMcKay: stagas: race condition?
[21:36] sebastia_ has joined the channel
[21:36] polotek: not so much that. but that Object.keys isn't gauranteed an order
[21:36] polotek: anyway would you go about it that way, you should have the event name when you set the listener. just use a closure
[21:37] TheFuzzball: Hmm, fs.stat(FILE,function(err,stats){ console.log(stats.size) }) works, but how do I pass stats.size to the parent function?
[21:37] polotek: also I think this._events is reset by setting to null. so may not always be there. take a look at EventEmitter
[21:37] febits has joined the channel
[21:38] TheFuzzball: If I do var filesize; fs.stat(FILE,function(err,stats){ filesize = stats.size }); console.log(filesize), filesize is undefined.
[21:38] polotek: TheFuzzball: fs.stat is asynchronous, by the time it comes back, your calling function is already over
[21:38] DrMcKay: dob_: what do you mean exactly?
[21:38] polotek: you need to continue your code *inside* the fs.stat callback
[21:39] TooTallNate: austinbv: kon_: I ended up writing a parser:

[21:39] TooTallNate: I should be keeping a counter for the number of brackets encountered though....
[21:39] dob_: i have the problem that i have a regex which should createa mongoose select. 
[21:39] dob_: DrMcKay: http://pastebin.com/BZidxvYS
[21:40] stagas: polotek: you're right. a context method or getter to get this event's name would be handy, this.event or something
[21:40] austinbv: TooTallNate: you should use recursion instead of a count
[21:40] austinbv: its cleaner
[21:40] dob_: And i get sometimes errors when there are strange symbols etc.
[21:40] polotek: stagas: talked about that with the folks doing eventemitter2
[21:40] polotek: it's a nice idea, but it's still shared state and so unreliable
[21:41] dob_: now i want to limit it to alphanumeric only.
[21:41] TooTallNate: austinbv: I would, but I don't want to parse the individual elements at that moment
[21:41] polotek: consider doing another async call inside your listener. now that callback may see a different emitter.event
[21:41] TheFuzzball: polotek Thanks for that :)
[21:42] austinbv: ah
[21:42] austinbv: easy enought then
[21:43] polotek: dob_: if( /[a-zA-Z0-9]/.test(text) ) { /* fail */ }
[21:43] polotek: don't bother trying to turn the whole thing into a regex
[21:43] polotek: err, actually you need to take the negation of the test, but you get the point :)

[23:16] klj613: Insekticid: yes
[23:16] Prometheus: Marak: yeah, the toc doesn't close
[23:16] Prometheus: unless you click on the links, obviously
[23:16] Insekticid: klj613: curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
[23:17] Marak: Prometheus: i have a click event on body that does a delegation based on tagName

[23:17] Marak: Prometheus: im unsure why it doesnt work on ipad, and my normal debugging techniques involve a web console 
[23:17] Marak: Prometheus: i dont know how makes ipads
[23:17] Marak: Prometheus: only webscale
[23:18] __sorin__ has joined the channel
[23:18] klj613: Insekticid: i'll try that again. already tried about 5 times, followed about 4 tutorials to the exact command.. it just hangs abit then i get alot of errors
[23:19] Insekticid: klj613: Can you post these errors on pastie.org?
[23:19] Prometheus: Marak: would this have anything to do with it: http://www.danwellman.co.uk/fixing-jquery-click-events-for-the-ipad/ ?
[23:19] blup has joined the channel
[23:19] Prometheus: though not very elegant
[23:19] Marak: Prometheus: maybe, but without having a way to test, it might as well be a tutorial on klingon 
[23:20] mrdoodles: Marak: simulator?
[23:20] Prometheus: Marak: if you are on macs, there should be a simulator for ipad
[23:20] Marak: mrdoodles: link? i have no clue
[23:20] Prometheus: on mac*
[23:20] Marak: googling
[23:20] Prometheus: I think xcode contains one
[23:20] Prometheus: if I'm not mistaken
[23:20] mrdoodles: yes, it does.
[23:20] shanebo: d3x7r0, c4milo1 thanks for the ideas guys

[23:21] Prometheus: Marak: but if you want, you can just ping me when you've made changes and I can test it on my iPad
[23:21] klj613: Insekticid: http://pastie.org/2478225
[23:21] mrdoodles: yeah individual items on the docs page are borked
[23:22] d3x7r0: Marak: I think you can make safari for osx/windows to pretend it's an iPad. Not sure how much that helps though
[23:22] Prometheus: Marak: however, as far as the layout goes, it looks fine for me
[23:22] Prometheus: though I'm on iPad 2
[23:22] Marak: d3x7r0: hrmm?
[23:22] Insekticid: klj613: What is your node version?
[23:22] cole_gillespie: Marak, are you on mac?
[23:23] Marak: aye
[23:23] klj613: Insekticid: 0.5.6-pre
[23:23] Insekticid: klj613: try it with v0.5.5
[23:24] klj613: Insekticid: how would i get a specific version?
[23:24] Insekticid: klj613: install Node Version Manager
[23:24] Prometheus: Marak: though the background image separating the navigation and the content is actually not showing up
[23:24] Prometheus: there's a pretty easy fix for that I think
[23:24] Marak: Prometheus: yeah...
[23:24] Insekticid: klj613: https://github.com/creationix/nvm
[23:25] Prometheus: oh, now that there's more people active here, should I prefer nvm or nave? or does it really even matter? :)
[23:25] Marak: i dont have time to download and install all this stuff now, i was hoping for a quick dmg
[23:25] Marak: im gonna take a look later, maybe buy an ipad
[23:25] Marak: >.,
[23:26] Marak: >.<
[23:26] Marak: fuck it, back to hook.io commits for the day

[23:27] Insekticid: Insekticid: or if you want only quick solution, remove your current node and try to follow this commands http://pastie.org/pastes/2478241/text
[23:27] Prometheus: Marak: for the layout?
[23:27] Prometheus: Marak: sure
[23:27] Marak: Prometheus: thank you
[23:27] Insekticid: omg
[23:27] Prometheus: Marak: np
