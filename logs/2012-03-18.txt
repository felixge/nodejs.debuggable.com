[02:28] mmalecki: #problemsolved
[02:29] zackattack: lol
[02:29] Aria: sammmy: Depends on whether you have a task that an RDBMS is good at or the particular noSQL you use is good at.
[02:29] Aria: sammmy: NoSQL products are similar only in that they're not SQL. A lot of them are totally alien to each other.
[02:29] sammmy: Aria: How do I know which are best at?
[02:30] Aria: Good question ;-)
[02:30] Aria: Careful analysis. 
[02:30] Aria: Learn why each was designed, know what problem it's solving.
[02:30] Aria: Memcache? raw get and set speed at the expense of all else, including a nearly pathological avoidance of durability.
[02:30] Aria: Redis? Your classic computer science primitives, networked. 
[02:31] Aria: Mongo? Flexibly shaped storage with some RDBMS-like indexing, plus some nice sharding and clustering built-ins. Trades off a little durability for write speed.
[02:31] Aria: Mysql Handlersocket? Raw table-like reads without join machinery.
[02:32] Aria: Couch is much like mongo, plus some clever synchronization stuff that makes it rock for offline use.
[02:32] mmalecki: couch has a neat real time features like _changes as well.
[02:32] Aria: Cassandra? Very fast queries on very wide tables. The tradeoff is schema changes are a pain -- it takes a stop and start to change the shape of things.
[02:32] Aria: Indeed.
[02:33] Aria: 4Store, and even more so, Neo4J? Graph-shaped access -- good for following the connections between things.
[02:34] Aria: Some of these systems lack atomicity, many lack higher-level transactions.
[02:34] rtgibbons has joined the channel
[02:34] Aria: Some are really low-level (Redis and Memcache), some are very high-level (Neo4J, Mongo, Couch)
[02:34] Aria: Oh, and don't forget Git. Great for tree-shaped data, great for storing the history of trees, too.
[02:35] Aria: And great at incremental replication for intermittently connected nodes.

[02:45] sammmy: Aria: Would MySQL be good for real-time applications, or is this something a NoSQL db would do better at?
[02:45] Aria: sammmy: define 'real-time applications' ?
[02:46] Aria: What sort of data? What sort of durability? What sort of consistency requirements? What latency requirements?
[02:46] Aria: What sort of operations on that data?
[02:47] Aria: (Small tidbit: MySQL was actually first designed for logging. So it's actually really, really, really good at high-write-volume tasks.)
[02:47] joaojeronimo: Hi guys, does anyone happen to know the right syntax for ZRANGEBYSCORE with LIMIT in node_redis by mranney ? I understood how it works but can't get a clue on how to use the LIMIT on this... can't find any type of documentation or hints...
[02:47] joaojeronimo has joined the channel
[02:47] hipsters_ has joined the channel
[02:48] sammmy: What do you mean by durability, stability? Consistency? I don't want any latency, because latency means slow, right? As you can see, I'm not too familiar with all the database terminology.
[02:48] brainss: hah, voltdb is sponsering node philly!
[02:49] brainss: can't wait, definitely gonna check it out
[02:49] joaojeronimo: Gatoradecode: had the same problem. It uses about 14mb of RAM, depending on the modules you load and your code in general... You can check it with process.memoryUsage: http://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_memoryusage 
[02:50] Aria: sammmy: They're all trade-offs. If you need your requests to complete faster than disks can service, you WILL have to trade off the possibility that you could lose some data if the power glitches or there's a fault.
[02:50] Aria: sammmy: Because sub-millisecond accesses are pretty much limited to RAM.
[02:51] Aria: sammmy: So that's where things like memcache and redis are good: They make those trade-offs.
[02:51] sammmy: Aria: Isn't this what redis is good for then?
[02:51] sammmy: yeah.
[02:51] Aria: sammmy: Latency isn't neccesarily bad, if you can tolerate it -- systems with higher latency often have higher throughput.
[02:51] sammmy: throughput?
[02:51] Aria: They can process more data in the same amount of time overall.
[02:51] Aria: (because often working in large batches is more efficient)
[02:52] Aria: (Like Dynamo+MapReduce vs MySQL at the same task)
[02:52] Aria: (But MySQL can often get you a smaller answer faster)
[02:52] dylang has joined the channel
[02:53] Aria: (But Dynamo can get you ALL the answers faster)
[02:53] Aria: It really depends on the exact task at hand.
[02:53] Aria: At work we use MySQL, in a couple ways, and memcache. Soon to add Redis and Gearman.
[02:54] Aria: We use MySQL for some relatively intensive searching -- many fields, lots of ad-hoc criteria.
[02:54] Aria: And to run a reporting server. 
[02:54] Aria: We use memcache for the moment-to-moment operation of the website. Good for having something really fast to hold session and object data.
[02:55] Aria: Just enough to keep it relatively consistent between front-end nodes. We do have some race conditions, but we've coded to tolerate them.
[02:55] Aria: (Basically, we just assume that if two actions collide, the last one must be the correct one, and so be it.)
[02:55] Aria: Redis we'll be doing some more precise things with. Keeping track of who's online Right Now with it.
[02:56] Aria: And Gearman, we'll use as storage only in so far as it holds data long enough to get it to the next thing that has to process it. Notifications, mostly.
[02:56] sammmy: Hmm. I should ask: I'm looking to stray away from SQL because it causes me pain, so what is a good replacement for it, and what are the drawbacks from moving away from SQL?
[02:56] Aria: Hehe. Depends on the task.
[02:56] Aria: NoSQL is more about having more tools for the different jobs you have to do, rather than having to only use one big tool.
[02:56] RichardBronosky has joined the channel
[02:56] Aria: It's not a single thing for SURE.
[02:56] Aria: Have super simple data, but need extreme speed? Redis.
[02:57] Aria: Need to follow connections between things? Neo4J.
[02:57] sammmy: Redis is just key:value stores?
[02:57] sammmy: Any data nesting in Redis?
[02:57] Aria: No, redis is a bunch of different types of data: key-value, lists of values, sets of values, and "Ranked sets" (basically, ordered lists of number:key pairs)
[02:57] Aria: Not at the top level.
[02:58] Aria: Redis would let you put json in a data value in a lot of places though
[02:58] Aria: No indexing into it. If you want to make trees, you'd have to build them out of smaller pieces though.
[02:58] sammmy: I see. I'll need hierachical data though
[02:59] Aria: Then it may not serve all your needs. (I bet most people using redis use it with something else.)
[02:59] Aria: What sort of data? Edited how?
[02:59] nafis has joined the channel
[02:59] Aria: Accessed by its root nodes, or would you want to index by the leaves?
[03:00] nafis has joined the channel
[03:00] Aria: Heirarchies are hard, in a lot of ways. We humans care about the data at the leaves, but that's often the most expensive place to get to.

[03:04] joshthecoder has joined the channel
[03:04] sammmy: I'd like to create a database one day that's very straight forward. I'll call it DumB, but I wonder if that's already taken? xP
[03:04] Leemp: Anyone know where you would find documentation on the various built in middlewares for express? (Ie, what options various middleware can take?)
[03:04] Aria: Nice.  Those work. It does explode in complexity in some ways, but depending on the size of your trees, that might just work.
[03:05] sammmy: Leemp: Express uses Connect's middleware, and there's documentation on that. Also reference the Express guide, I suppose.
[03:05] Leemp: sammmy: Ah hah, thanks for the pointer! :)
[03:07] sammmy: Aria: I like how closure tables keep a detailed (but not overly detailed) dataset on each node. However, the deeper the nodes are nested within the tree the more rows required. A node 10 levels deep requires 11 records (I believe), while a node 1 level deep requires 2.
[03:07] Aria: Quite. That gets expensive.
[03:08] Aria: What you should do depends on how you access that tree.
[03:08] Aria: What you REALLY need to do with it.
[03:08] sammmy: But the trade off is with faster node tree selection.
[03:09] sammmy: I need to be able to get a set of ancestor nodes, I know that.

[03:09] Aria: To what end?
[03:09] davidbanham has joined the channel
[03:09] sammmy: Aria: How do you mean?
[03:09] Aria: (Could you just index each node with its list of ancestors, and not store the tree at all?)
[03:09] Aria: I mean, what do you do with this query?
[03:10] PsiliPharm has joined the channel
[03:10] Aria: (a lot of NoSQL is about storing data how it's going to be accessed, not in its most-normal form, too)
[03:12] sammmy: I'd like to keep all ancestry data on every node. I wouldn't want to not know where a node is in a tree. For example, if I just stored 10 ancestors for each node, then I wouldn't have much flexibility later on if I decide I want to do other things with my tree.

[03:20] sammmy: What are you losing from RDBMS if you decide to use a document-based system like MongoDB exclusively?

[03:22] Aria: Atomicity for a lot of common cases. No greater transactions though.
[03:22] gr4yscale has joined the channel

[03:52] Aria: And the answer to that is usually 'yes'
[03:53] sammmy: I've been finding it awkward working with MySQL in Node.js

[04:34] michaelmartinez: Maybe I was projecting a bit. I was hoping to find something better than registry.npmjs.org. (I don't want to come off as a whiny bitch) But its fucking insane trying to find a package/module.
[04:34] mattrobenolt: npm search {{ module }} ?
[04:34] mattrobenolt: I don't think I've ever actually gone to the registry to search for something.
[04:35] michaelmartinez: So how do you know whats out there Ie. something you missed that is cool...
[04:35] michaelmartinez: what is
[04:35] mattrobenolt: Search for it? haha
[04:35] michaelmartinez: :)
[04:35] jakehow has joined the channel
[04:35] mattrobenolt: Usually you know what you're looking for.
[04:35] mattrobenolt: I don't generally browse the npm registry to see what people have done.
[04:36] mattrobenolt: I know I'm looking for something that does X.
[04:36] michaelmartinez: Then download it, eval it, try to decide if there is support...
[04:36] mattrobenolt: If I find something, I usually check it out on GitHub.
[04:36] michaelmartinez: support being; active development, tests, bugs, etc
[04:36] mattrobenolt: Yeah, well, that's for you to decide. There's no science for it.
[04:37] michaelmartinez: When you don't roll it yourself, you are in a sense adopting it
[04:37] mattrobenolt: Usually, I'm ok taking on any library because I can patch any real bug I find.
[04:37] mattrobenolt: Right.
[04:37] michaelmartinez: right.
[04:37] mattrobenolt: But certain things, you're not going to want to roll yourself.
[04:37] mattrobenolt: Like a MySQL library.
[04:38] michaelmartinez: right.
[04:38] petschm_ has joined the channel
[04:38] mattrobenolt: You have to adopt modules.
[04:38] rwaldron has joined the channel
[04:38] mattrobenolt: You can generally tell a well put together module from one that was slapped together.
[04:39] michaelmartinez: Yeah, if it says authored by michaelmartinez... stay the eff away :))
[04:39] mattrobenolt: Larger modules like MySQL or something of that nature, I'm ok assuming that someone else much smarter than me wrote it.
[04:39] mattrobenolt: And the module probably has 500+ watchers on GH, full, thorough documentation, etc.
[04:40] mattrobenolt: Anything smaller, be ready to patch it yourself in a panic situation.
[04:40] mattrobenolt: We fork a lot of things for our own purposes and patch things before the upstream does if necessary.
[04:40] michaelmartinez: Good stuff. Thanks for setting me right.
[04:41] mattrobenolt: No problem. You, unfortunately, have to have some faith in others to be smarter than you.
[04:41] michaelmartinez: Dude, I know most everyone is smarter than me... 
[04:41] michaelmartinez: That isn't the prob.
[04:41] mattrobenolt: haha, then accept it and go on with your day. :)
[04:42] mattrobenolt: npm search whatever you need. Use it. If it works, awesome.
[04:42] mattrobenolt: Honestly, there isn't much more effort than that.
[04:42] mattrobenolt: Usually, if you pick a module and you can't get up and running with it, stay away.
[04:42] michaelmartinez: Nice. I am just so used to the front end world
[04:43] mattrobenolt: If the docs are clear and nice enough to get you using it without hassle, it's probably good all around.
[04:43] michaelmartinez: Winners are easily declared
[04:43] mattrobenolt: Big modules usually have clear winners.
[04:43] mattrobenolt: Like, I think for MySQL, there are only one or two libraries on top.
[04:43] michaelmartinez: Yeah, I can def see some leaders
[04:43] mattrobenolt: When you get into some obscure things, yeah, you'll have some trial and error.
[04:43] mattrobenolt: It's like that with anything.
[04:44] michaelmartinez: Most def.
[04:44] mattrobenolt: You have your top players for JS frameworks. jQuery, MooTools, etc.
[04:44] mattrobenolt: But when it comes down to a jQuery lightbox script… well, you have 1000 options. Pick one that works for you, haha
[04:44] michaelmartinez: Yeah... the front-end world everything seems really clear to me. I guess I am so new to the backend stuff... its all really hazy
[04:45] michaelmartinez: Experience. It matters.
[04:45] mattrobenolt: But usually those libraries are so small that you can really maintain them yourself. If 1000 people have written their own versions, it must not be too rough. A MySQL library or a full JS framework on the other hand, is only done by small numbers of people.
[04:46] michaelmartinez: What are you working on, are you a node dev full time?
[04:46] gr4yscale has joined the channel
[04:46] mattrobenolt: Noo, I've contributed small amounts, but not a core dev.
[04:46] mattrobenolt: I'm more in Python land.
[04:46] michaelmartinez: ahhh
[04:46] michaelmartinez: cool just the same
[04:46] mattrobenolt: I've been spending some time lately going through some of my libraries adding more tests, etc.
[04:47] mattrobenolt: So I've been hanging out in IRC with some obscure questions, haha
[04:47] michaelmartinez: Nice. I am not quite there for obscure stuff. But I am banging away on the trivial shit.
[04:48] mattrobenolt: Do you play in Python land?
[04:48] michaelmartinez: I think my specialty is calculators :))
[04:48] mattrobenolt: haha
[04:48] michaelmartinez: No, I actually picked up Node to get into backend stuff a bit. Become a more well rounded dev.
[04:49] mattrobenolt: You just do frontend js now?
[04:49] michaelmartinez: Mostly...
[04:49] michaelmartinez: And mostly mobile

[04:50] mattrobenolt: Then you should be fine. Node is easy compared to Java.

[04:56] michaelmartinez: I am not a professional programmer, so I have some imposter syndrome and tend to be really sheepish
[04:56] mattrobenolt: joaojeronimo: The callback patterns and whatnot don't bother me at all. I just visually can't make it look nice.

[05:53] westg: can someone explain to me what it means to share code between the server and browser?
[05:58] Aria: westg: If you render initial pages on the server, but update parts with ajax, you might send just the data to the client and have the same code you used run in the browser for speed resons
[05:59] Aria: Or in a websocket protocol, where both ends send the same kinds of messages, you'd use the same code at both ends.

[06:06] tornad has joined the channel
[06:07] chrisdickinson: really, the API you're providing (whether it be event emitter-based or callback based) is a separate solution from using named functions.
[06:07] chrisdickinson: named functions can cut down on nesting, and make stack traces easier to read.
[06:07] chrisdickinson: event emitter / promise vs. callback is basically a question of "does this API emit data continuously, or does it just return with the full result immediately."
[06:08] chrisdickinson: EE's are good for the former, callbacks are good at the latter.

[12:22] deoxxa: basically generating a url from a route
[12:22] vdemedes: deoxxa: no, because I don't know what does it mean
[12:22] deoxxa: https://github.com/deoxxa/houkou << like this
[12:22] vdemedes: well, I got it
[12:22] vdemedes: but what is the benefit?
[12:23] vdemedes: deoxxa: like URL generators in Rails?
[12:23] deoxxa: i'm not sure how rails works, but it's probably similar
[12:24] deoxxa: basically from the route configuration, you can generate a url with the route parameters in place
[12:24] deoxxa: so you can do something like
[12:24] deoxxa: `res.redirect(blog_post_route.generate({id: 5, slug: "this-is-something"}))'
[12:24] vdemedes: deoxxa: Rails can generate URL from model, url_for(model) if I'm not mistaken
[12:24] vdemedes: oh, I got it
[12:24] vdemedes: yeah, it's the same as in Rails
[12:25] vdemedes: Will consider this for the next release

[14:17] deoxxa: mmalecki: not a fan of the templating in flatiron, unfortunately
[14:17] deoxxa: i did look at it a while back
[14:17] mmalecki: deoxxa: you can still use whichever templating engine you like
[14:17] mmalecki: flatiron doesn't discriminate :)
[14:18] alpaca: so i just started with node.js, any other great resources besides the official docs?
[14:18] alpaca: just looking to get my hands on anything that is good reading and get started on a project
[14:20] chjj has joined the channel
[14:20] deoxxa: mmalecki: given that i have my own routing, templating and database stuff, what would flatiron do for me?

[14:21] Poetro: so u dont have to write those tools again
[14:21] alpaca: Poetro: perfect, what are some popular/good ones?

[14:23] AntelopeSalad: deoxxa: what do you find yourself needing to replace in express?
[14:23] alpaca: thanks Poetro, ill do some reading :D
[14:24] Poetro: alpaca: it depends what kind of applications you'd want to write in node
[14:24] deoxxa: AntelopeSalad: views and routing - views were easy enough, but routing is proving quite a bit trickier
[14:24] yawNO has joined the channel
[14:24] AntelopeSalad: how would flatiron's routing system fix that?
[14:24] Poetro: alpaca: for example if u want to write console applications an options parser is a must, and there are also other tools to help u with that
[14:25] deoxxa: it... doesn't?
[14:25] Poetro: alpaca: if u want to write web apps, that needs other kind of toolings
[14:25] AntelopeSalad: oh, i only asked because i'm thinking about experimenting with flatiron too
[14:25] trivol has joined the channel
[14:25] alpaca: yeah, going to be writing web apps
[14:26] Poetro: alpaca: then the modules i listed should be right to get you started, whichever framework u choose
[14:26] AntelopeSalad: kind of curious though, what aspects of express' routes are conflicting with your needs?
[14:26] s0urce: anyone can tell me how to setup subdomains for "http-proxy" module?
[14:26] deoxxa: there's no way to generate urls from routes
[14:26] deoxxa: that's the main thing
[14:27] alpaca: thanks for the help Poetro 
[14:27] deoxxa: so if you have a lot of routes and a lot of redirects or links, you have to go through and manually change them whenever a route changes
[14:27] Poetro: alpaca: maybe also try geddy, that is another framework so u can have a broader choice
[14:27] deoxxa: it also makes dynamically building routes and their corresponding links hard
[14:27] totallymike: deoxxa: couldn't you use constantish variables to define the components of your route strings?
[14:28] chjj has joined the channel
[14:28] alpaca: i might check out express first, it has the most appealing name :P
[14:28] alpaca: haha im going to read about all of them though
[14:28] deoxxa: totallymike, i could, but then i wouldn't be able to validate the generated urls
[14:28] totallymike: var FOO = '/foo', BAR = '/bar'; app.get(FOO + BAR)
[14:28] Poetro: alpaca: and also listen to the recent NodeUp podcasts, they have some nice discussion on it
[14:28] alpaca: cool, im ready to dive head first into this :]
[14:29] deoxxa: i've actually got a router written already: https://github.com/deoxxa/houkou
[14:29] AntelopeSalad: wow
[14:29] totallymike: That's probably true, I'm asking more for my own benefit than anyone else's ;)
[14:29] deoxxa: it's just trying to figure out how to shoehorn it into express that's hard

[14:30] AntelopeSalad: or is that a completely different concern
[14:31] deoxxa: i'm actually pretty strongly considering that exact approach
[14:31] deoxxa: i'm right now reading through the connect docs :P
[14:31] AntelopeSalad: what if you just used flatiron's middleware plugin which is backwards compatible with connect
[14:32] AntelopeSalad: and then instead of flatiron's router, you used your router?
[14:32] deoxxa: hmm, interesting
[14:32] jetienne_ has joined the channel
[14:32] AntelopeSalad: from what i read i think that's the whole goal of flatiron

[20:16] maxogden: davidcramer: but ill check out your stuff
[20:17] davidcramer: maxogden, ya this is a much more contextual style of logging (its generally not good for logging things that arent exceptions)
[20:17] blup has joined the channel
[20:17] davidcramer: the node.js implementation may not capture a ton of data yet, but the python one, for example, dumps a ton of context when theres an exception

[21:15] gr4yscale has joined the channel
[21:15] sandfox: AviMarcus: yeah but alas all of the seem too slow… or use crappy indexing.. my data will be readonly so i'd like to use something with kdtrees as its super fast. I've written something in nodejs which does sub millisecond responses but with large datatset it consumes a lot of ram and the GC goes nuts for a couple of seconds every now and again

[21:25] owen1: design question - i have a user object and a scrapper. currently i pass the user to the scrapper and it knows to scrape this user's urls. is it better to have a scrapper that recieves urls instead of passing the user object?
[21:26] Brandon_R: yes
[21:26] Brandon_R: composition over inheritance
[21:26] owen1: Brandon_R: there is no inheritance here.
[21:27] timoxley: owen1 better to pass urls
[21:27] Brandon_R: i mean separation of concerns
[21:27] timoxley: owen1 reduces coupling
[21:27] Brandon_R: should the scraper be concerned about the user object?
[21:27] Brandon_R: and yes, it prevents coupling
[21:27] owen1: Brandon_R: oh. SRP
[21:27] owen1: so my scrapper should be more generic. it should not care about the internals of my user
[21:27] timoxley: owen1 exactly.
[21:28] owen1: and it will be easier to reuse it

[22:15] sammmy: haha
[22:15] rlidwka: owen1: i think new dpkg is installed to /usr/bin, right?  so, you can remove anything you want from /usr/local and it shouldnt affect the node
[22:16] owen1: rlidwka: yeah. i just did it. 
[22:16] sammmy: Still trying to figure this out. You're saying that it's as simple as npm /path/to/old/node and it'll remove all the node modules I had installed too?

[22:27] zackattack has joined the channel
[22:27] owen1: sammmy: doing what?
[22:27] kesor: how do i know which module is the latest/best for a certain task? for example I want a jasmine runner, but there are 22 modules for npm search jasmine. I don't really have time to evaluate all of them … :/
[22:27] sammmy: owen1: sudo aptitude install npm
[22:28] Dreamer3 has joined the channel
[22:28] owen1: sammmy: what error do u get, and do u have the latest node?
[22:28] sammmy: owen1: says it cannot find the package.
[22:28] chjj has joined the channel
[22:28] owen1: sammmy: node -v
[22:28] sammmy: Oh, I have to install the latest node first? xP
[22:28] SubStack: that is a silly way to think about doing testing
[22:28] owen1: sammmy: yeah, follow the 4 lines from github
[22:29] sammmy: ok
[22:29] rlidwka: kesor: see a number of watches and forks on github + last updates
[22:29] owen1: SubStack: that's what i currently do on my ruby/rails/sinatra
[22:29] owen1: SubStack: please show me the node way
[22:29] kesor: rlidwka: any web page that summarizes that information anywhere? …
[22:30] owen1: so far in node i used jasmin-node, but willing to try mocha/vows or whatever
[22:30] kesor: any good unit testing tutorial for nodejs you can recommend?
[22:31] rlidwka: kesor: try http://toolbox.no.de/
[22:31] kesor: rlidwka: sweet. thanks.
[22:32] rlidwka: and http://search.npmjs.org/ , but you probably already know this
[22:32] Dreamer3 has joined the channel
[22:33] sammmy: owen1: I see now. ppa is a package list, in other words it helps aptitude recognize the nodejs and npm packages?
[22:33] netxshare: could someone take a look at this for me? 
[22:33] owen1: sammmy: i think it will add node to your available packages
[22:33] owen1: and npm
[22:33] chjj has joined the channel
[22:34] netxshare: http://www.privatepaste.com/ce98816d5e this.pool in getdata is undefined
[22:34] netxshare: wondering what I am doing wrong
[22:34] sammmy: owen1: right. I see.
[22:35] kesor: i'm quite new to nodejs. so just started looking around at whats available, hogan.js is mustache.js, and jade is haml? any preference either way?
[22:35] objectiveous has joined the channel
[22:36] sammmy: Why isn't there a way to remove the older version of node using a package manager? Instead i have to manually remove the files.
[22:36] bingomanatee has joined the channel
[22:36] owen1: sammmy: what files? node and npm?
[22:37] rlidwka: sammmy: because the older version wasn't installed using a package manager?
[22:37] metaverse has joined the channel

[22:37] sammmy: owen1: yeah, /usr/local/bin/node and /usr/local/bin/npm
[22:37] sammmy: rlidwka: oh. I couldn't remember if it was. Sense when has it been now?
[22:38] markwubb_ has joined the channel
[22:38] joshthecoder has joined the channel
[22:38] rlidwka: so, package manager have no way of knowing if some file is related to node... how can it uninstall it?
[22:39] EvRide has joined the channel
[22:39] sammmy: rlidwka: Yeah that makes sense.
[22:40] kesor: is anyone using jade+hogan together, or that doesnt make any sense?
[22:41] SubStack: owen1: anyways take a look at https://github.com/isaacs/node-tap
[22:41] sammmy: Where are all the latest node files located, just so I know not to delete those ever?

[22:44] rlidwka: sammmy: try "dpkg -L node.js" command (where node.js is a name of installed package)

[22:45] chjj has joined the channel
[22:45] jperkin: most shells keep a hash of accessed files, run 'hash -r' to update it then you won't get that error (but probably a different one instead)
[22:45] sammmy: rlidwka: I tried: dpkg -L nodejs and it gave me a large list of directories.
[22:46] objectiveous_ has joined the channel
[22:46] sammmy: I guess I have to set my PATH env var?
[22:46] rlidwka: sammmy: yeah... that's it. All the latest node files. :)

[22:52] supertask has joined the channel
[22:52] kesor: i just started digging into nodejs, there are too many alternatives, its all very confusing.
[22:52] timoxley: kesor yes, it's quite familiar if you've previously worked in that space

[23:00] owen1: SubStack: tap not working unless i install it with -g
[23:01] ohtogo has joined the channel
[23:01] SubStack: owen1: I usually run the tests with node anyways
[23:01] sammmy: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
[23:01] sammmy:  is my PATH, yet node is not found? :S
[23:02] SubStack: owen1: bin scripts only get installed globally into your $PATH when you install -g
[23:02] SubStack: it's not just a tap thing
[23:02] owen1: SubStack: yeah. it's not working even with -g. i get : Error: Cannot find module 'tap'
[23:02] owen1: when i try to require it.
[23:03] owen1: (from test.js or from the node console)
[23:03] SubStack: kesor: I like to pull down json with ajax and skip templates altogether
[23:03] owen1: npm list -g|grep tap => tap@0.2.4 
[23:03] kesor: SubStack: so the html files are just static and served with the webserver, and nodejs is just for json browser->server communication?
[23:04] SubStack: pretty much
[23:04] SubStack: or I use dnode when I need more complicated browser<->server interaction
[23:04] kesor: sounds suitable for my needs as well actually.
[23:04] thinkt4nk has joined the channel
[23:05] Dreamer3 has joined the channel
[23:05] SubStack: and I use browserify to stitch all the front-end code together
[23:05] owen1: kesor: are u going to render the html on the client? u can still use templates, right?
[23:05] SubStack: so I can use node-style require()s browser-side
[23:05] kesor: owen1: no, really no reason to render templates on client side.
[23:05] sammmy: Dur. Just had to restart my console. I wonder why though. xP
[23:05] owen1: kesor: so where do u render them?
[23:06] briancray has joined the channel
[23:06] kesor: owen1: server-side, and as SubStack said they will probably be just static html.
[23:06] chjj has joined the channel
[23:07] shedinja_ has joined the channel
[23:07] owen1: kesor: ok. so u serve static html to the client, and make more calles to node to get some json?
[23:07] kesor: yep
[23:07] dafuq has joined the channel
[23:08] owen1: and where do u connect the json to the html? not on the client? or on the client, but not using templating?
[23:08] dafuq: guys anyone having duplicate messages when doint interprocess communication with node cluster?
[23:08] blueadept` has joined the channel
[23:08] kesor: owen1: without templating, there will be some logic … but its an interesting idea to use templating to make it a bit easier.

[23:28] sammmy: What is the /var directory used for really? Does it just stand for variable stuff, kind of like miscellaneous?

[23:48] deoxxa: you get neat looking forms and menus and all that stuff for free - pretty great

[23:49] kesor: well, jquery-ui has some nice stuff like drag-n-drop, autocomplete, etc ...
[23:49] Joeysomo has joined the channel
[23:49] deoxxa: it's just so heavy
[23:50] kesor: wish there was something lightweight that did it … but i'm not aware of any such thing.
[23:50] mansoor: why dont' you just include the parts that you want? You can build it on their site
[23:51] kesor: the jquery-ui parts, sure, but then the colors don't fit. thats why I found that jquery-ui bootstrap theme useful.
