[00:10] Aria: What problem?
[00:10] Aria: Oh, your regular expression? That's POSIX basic syntax.
[00:11] Aria: Javascript's regexes are POSIX extended syntax, more or less.
[00:11] Aria: so \( should be (, \) should be ), \? should be ?.

[00:22] Aria: Oh.
[00:22] Aria: You're delimiting with /
[00:22] Aria: So the second / is the end of the regex.
[00:22] Aria: You need to change / to \/
[00:22] Aria: Or use the string form -- new Regexp('regex here')

[00:25] JmZ: nice regex
[00:25] Aria: (? starts a group, but what are you trying to match with that part?
[00:25] aroman: is there a pretty printer for node?
[00:26] WarheadsSE: eBay = powned...
[00:26] eeemsi: in all i want to check whether there is an url or not ;)
[00:27] JmZ: erm
[00:27] eeemsi: and according to the rfc that is a regex for that usecase
[00:27] Juan77 has joined the channel
[00:27] JmZ: well, iirc it is the regex to validate a url, not detect/parse URLs
[00:27] liar has joined the channel
[00:28] djMax has joined the channel
[00:28] JmZ: something along those lines anyway, i remember having a lengthy discussion about it with the guys on ##php
[00:28] djMax: how does one view the output of DTRACE lines inside node?
[00:28] eeemsi: for those who are interested here's the rfc http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#appendix-B
[00:29] JmZ: ah i got it the wrong way around
[00:29] JmZ: for parsing not validating
[00:29] Xiphias3 has joined the channel
[00:29] Aria: Oh, I see. Put the \ before the ?
[00:29] Aria: (? starts a group, you do actually want a literal ?
[00:29] Aria: So \?
[00:29] JmZ: since it's a pretty generic pattern, it doesn't check if the URL is valid
[00:30] JmZ: what do you mean (? starts a group? (? means absolutely nothing, just a subpattern starting with a ?
[00:30] JmZ: though it should be escaped
[00:30] Aria: No, that's the thing -- (? isn't valid.
[00:30] Aria: (\? starts a subpattern starting with ?
[00:30] JmZ: which is what i just said, it means nothing
[00:30] Aria: But (? expects : after it to start a group.
[00:30] Aria: Meaning nothing is different than being an error ;-)
[00:31] JmZ: you don't have to tell me, i do know regex very well 
[00:31] JmZ: it actually expects a : or =
[00:31] JmZ: fyi
[00:31] JmZ: or even a !
[00:32] eeemsi: hm‚Ä¶ it says everything in the message is an url ‚Ä¶ =(
[00:32] eeemsi: but the message looks like sdfssdfergf4eggddfgtrh5zhj5tjhzgjtzj6n
[00:32] JmZ: escape the ?, eeemsi

[00:32] JmZ: just like they do in the RFC
[00:33] TheFuzzball has joined the channel
[00:33] JmZ: also, again, the regex on the RFC is to parse a URL, not to detect or validate URLs. You'd use that pattern on something you already know to be a URL
[00:34] JmZ: it isn't meant to be used to match URLs in a larger string

[00:40] plutoniix has joined the channel
[00:40] Aria: \+ should be + there.
[00:40] eeemsi: JmZ: if the string contains a url then i want to do s.th. with that thing
[00:40] JmZ: yeah just noticed that aria
[00:41] Aria: Note to self: make a parse-basic and emit-extended regex page.
[00:42] eeemsi: hm‚Ä¶ still not working‚Ä¶ =(
[00:43] JmZ: overcomplicating things ftw
[00:43] eeemsi: its awesome to get help from you - thumbs up!
[00:43] JmZ: don't use such complicated regex if you're just checking if a string contains URL(s)

[00:44] pilgo: Is this known?
[00:44] lwille has joined the channel
[00:44] JmZ: eeemsi: also, like I SAID, for the 3rd time, that regex is made to *parse URLs*, not validate or detect/find them
[00:44] JmZ: it will match all sorts of malformed crap because it isn't meant to be used as you're using it
[00:45] eeemsi: oh‚Ä¶ ok
[00:45] eeemsi: so what would you recommend?
[00:45] JmZ: a better pattern
[00:45] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[00:46] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[00:46] flat has joined the channel
[00:46] JmZ: heres the one from the RFC: "^(([^:/?#]+):)?(//([^/?#]*))?([^?#]*)(\?([^#]*))?(#(.*))?", this will match things such as "abcdef"
[00:46] JmZ: it'll match anything in fact
[00:47] JmZ: because everything is optional except ([^?#]*), and that'll match any number of characters which aren't a ? or #
[00:47] JmZ: which is why it is meant for *parsing* URLs, not finding/matching them

[00:54] eeemsi: yes
[00:55] Aria: Er.
[00:55] Aria: how about /\b(https|http):\/\/\w+/ ?
[00:55] Aria: One too many \ in there.
[00:55] Aria: It's sloppy, but it probably does what you want.
[00:56] ammurorei has joined the channel
[00:56] Aria: :// is a pretty rare ocurrance in human text, and preceded by http or https is even rarer. It shouldn't yield too many false positives.
[00:56] Aria: It won't EXTRACT a URL, but it'll tell you if there are some.
[00:57] JmZ: no need for a subpattern
[00:57] eeemsi: Aria: i could tell you my masterplan ;)
[00:57] JmZ: you know, /\bhttps?:\/\/\w+/
[00:57] eeemsi: i want to get the title of that page and print it
[00:58] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[00:58] Aria: JmZ: Of course. But I prefer the explicit clarity of "Oh, look! It matches both"
[00:58] eeemsi: something like http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTAyNjU ‚Ä¶ [title] [Phoronix] Building The Linux Kernel In 60 Seconds
[00:58] Aria: Oh. So you DO want to extract the URL.
[00:58] JmZ: i prefer not having a subpattern i don't need
[00:59] JmZ: and reducing the length of the pattern drastically :p
[00:59] Aria: And I prefer fixed length match branches ;-)
[00:59] ixti has joined the channel
[01:00] JmZ: you prefer a whole subpattern vs one optional character?
[01:00] JmZ: ok then
[01:00] Aria: In this case. Not that it matters much.
[01:01] JmZ: just extra text that isn't needed :)
[01:01] JmZ: don't know why i care about this topic anyway, regex in JS is horrible and ugly

[05:00] Aria: jsdom is what lets you do that. It's what the html5 parser talks to to make the tree.
[05:01] Aria: But at that point, you're not parsing, you're manipulating the nodes directly.

[05:28] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[05:28] russfrank: if you wnat to use your jade templates in the browser, you can compile them offline and use the jade runtime.j
[05:28] russfrank: s
[05:28] denysonique: russfrank: I would like Backbone.js to render Jade templates on the client side
[05:28] lee_ has joined the channel
[05:28] russfrank: i did an experiment with that earlier today
[05:29] secoif: Guest4456 I've also heard of people using varnish
[05:29] denysonique: my problem is with integrating it into backbone
[05:29] russfrank: denysonique: so write a little compiler to jade.compile(jadestring, {client: true}) then output the compiled js to a file 
[05:29] russfrank: then <script>-in the jade runtime.js in your html file
[05:29] denysonique: ok
[05:29] russfrank: and you can just use those compiled jade template functions
[05:29] denysonique: so I need runtime.js too
[05:29] russfrank: just like you would use underscore or something
[05:30] russfrank: well
[05:30] russfrank: you can use runtime.js in the browser and then compile them first
[05:30] russfrank: or you can compile them on the client
[05:30] russfrank: i'd recommend compiling them first just because it makes sense it'll make them run faster in the browser
[05:30] secoif: russfrank you can't compile everything upfront
[05:30] russfrank: secoif: why not
[05:30] secoif: dynamic data
[05:30] russfrank: secoif: you misunderstand
[05:31] russfrank: compiling means that you produce a template function
[05:31] russfrank: into which you pass your data
[05:31] sreeix_ has joined the channel
[05:31] secoif: russfrank oh, of course. yeah do that.
[05:31] russfrank: jade.compile will give you that javascript function which you can then place in a file and pass to the client
[05:31] russfrank: yeah
[05:31] anoop has joined the channel
[05:32] secoif: according to some benchmarks I saw a while back, jade is rather slow at rendering. I usually use jade to render templates on server, then handlebars on the frontend.

[05:37] alystair: this is after installing the 0.6.5 msi from site
[05:37] isaacs: alystair: ah.  right.  express isn't ok with node 0.6
[05:37] isaacs: npm ERR! Required: {"node":">= 0.4.1 < 0.5.0"}
[05:37] alystair: oh.
[05:37] isaacs: alystair: you can tell it to shut up, by doing `npm install express --force`
[05:37] isaacs: but, it could be that things won't work quite right.
[05:37] alystair: will it explode into a firey flaming ball of fire?
[05:37] isaacs: no, not likely
[05:37] isaacs: more likely it'll implode in a whimpery ball of whimper
[05:38] isaacs: much less exciting
[05:39] secoif: isaacs express works with 0.6.x ?

[05:42] secoif: deanm you could do a benchmark
[05:42] secoif: deanm might be better to ask the nodejitsu guys in #nodejitsu

[06:32] ShinyDarkness_ has joined the channel
[06:33] Sample: for PHP et cet you certainly don't need to declare any such thing, i wonder if that's because something is covered behind the scenes or that node is just picky
[06:33] tuhoojabotti: Sample: I know.
[06:33] tuhoojabotti: But node ain't your php
[06:33] zomg: I bet you could use <?php and ?> as open/close tags in ejs
[06:33] tuhoojabotti: ugh
[06:33] tuhoojabotti: Sample: Kill zomg 
[06:33] zomg: Then just prefix all your view variables with a $ when assigning them
[06:33] zomg: problem?
[06:34] zomg: ;)
[06:35] MiiCode2 has joined the channel
[06:36] zomg: I'm pretty sure you need enctype in PHP too, at least if you're uploading files
[06:36] zomg: For standard POST'ing, not
[06:36] zomg: Nor do you need that in node either for that
[06:37] Sample: well this is a situation in which i couldnt get TEXT in a <textarea> to appear
[06:37] zomg: o_O
[06:37] zomg: That's odd
[06:37] Sample: and had to declare the enctype in the form for node to trigger the request.on('data')
[06:37] brianloveswords has joined the channel
[06:37] polotek has joined the channel
[06:37] zomg: Ah, could be it sends or processes the data differently when using that enctype
[06:38] zomg: I just use req.body.textfieldName when reading POST data
[06:38] zomg: which seems to work
[06:38] Sample: oh i had no idea you could do that, seems like a much more sane approach for passing plaintext
[06:39] zomg: Yeah if you use express you can do that, you just need to enable the bodyParser middleware (or whatever it was called)
[06:40] Sample: oh okay, yah im purposefully not using express yet, but it raises a good point that i should explore the request object anyways to see what i find
[06:41] braoru has joined the channel
[06:41] jhurliman: Sample, recent versions of express also support file uploads with bodyParser()
[06:42] sreeix has joined the channel
[06:42] tuhoojabotti: Yes
[06:42] tuhoojabotti: using a module for POST is a good idea.
[06:42] jhurliman: req.body.fileuploadfield (where fileuploadfield is the name of the file input html control) will be an object with several properties

[06:59] Sample: tuhoojabotti: just an update, some more interesting confusion
[06:59] Sample: although it works with multipart/form-data it just gives some strange string that seems meaningless (or that i cant figure out how to decrypt)
[06:59] Sample: also enctype isnt required
[07:00] r04r has joined the channel
[07:00] zomg: iirc it's urlencoded or something
[07:00] Sample: by default it sends with the very wordy application/x-www-form-urlencoded
[07:00] Sample: however both when specifying that enctype (as it was in my initial jsfiddle example by way of not declaring an enctype), the request.on('data') listener is never fired
[07:00] konobi: wireshark++
[07:00] Sample: which i find most unusual

[09:15] mikeal: i wrote a couch library
[09:15] booyaa: it still uses homebrew but sets up node, nginx, a few dbs (oddly no couch i think)
[09:15] booyaa: i think the guy atmos (works for github) also includes n or nvm

[09:26] booyaa: caioketo: 2nd code example on nodejs.org
[09:26] caioketo: ok, ill read that...

[09:41] booyaa: tanepiper: totally... they're also hedging on node.js
[09:41] tanepiper: booyaa: yea, i never bothered learning powershell and now I have nodejs to write scripts that I used to have to either run remotely or on a VM

[09:42] booyaa: tanepiper: air? or something beefy?
[09:42] booyaa: since switching to node.js for dev, i can seriously consider switch to an ipad
[09:42] tanepiper: Air 13" - it's pretty beefy anyway, can run the Thunderblot display no problem
[09:42] tanepiper: perfect for my needs
[09:42] booyaa: yeah air's performance at the moment is stunning
[09:43] booyaa: i've got a 2yr old mbp i think the air is comparable...

[11:21] jameshowe: or how otherwise one should implement /dev/urandom on Windows Node.JS
[11:22] benvie: Math.random()?
[11:22] benvie: it uses V8's
[11:22] jameshowe: cryptographically secure
[11:22] jimmysparkle has joined the channel
[11:22] jameshowe: to the extent that /dev/urandom is
[11:23] benvie: sec
[11:23] mspahn: In 2011 no one should use windows ;)

[11:26] jameshowe: corp policy
[11:26] mmalecki: you should develop on evironment you'll deploy to
[11:27] josephg: +1 to that
[11:27] AndreasMadsen has joined the channel
[11:27] jameshowe: but back to my original question: crypto.randomBytes - does it wait to collect sufficient entropy or not?
[11:27] benvie: #if defined(DEVRANDOM) || defined(DEVRANDOM_EGD)
[11:27] mmalecki: oh, and I'd run as fast as I could if that's a company policy
[11:27] mmalecki: and yeah, iirc it's cryptographically secure
[11:27] benvie: it uses openssl's random
[11:27] mmalecki: let me dig into the code
[11:28] josephg: yeah - I'd be surprised if crypto.randomBytes() could be insecure in some cases
[11:28] benvie: which uses /dev/random
[11:28] mmalecki: benvie++
[11:28] catb0t: benvie now has 1 beer
[11:28] jameshowe: so blocking then
[11:28] josephg: its possible.
[11:28] josephg: ‚Ä¶ I guess.
[11:28] jameshowe: well /dev/random is
[11:29] josephg: functions in the standard library can be blocking (eg, require, fs.readFileSync, etc)
[11:29] jameshowe: and i assume the windows/*nix builds of openssl behave the same
[11:29] jameshowe: I don't mean blocking in node
[11:29] benvie: well blocking how so
[11:29] mehlah has joined the channel
[11:29] benvie: yeah was going to say
[11:29] benvie: it'll be on the threadpool
[11:29] jameshowe: blocking like /dev/random is vs. .dev/urandom
[11:30] josephg: oh right...
[11:30] josephg: randomBytes(size, [callback])
[11:30] josephg: so yeah, it'll wait until there's enough entropy to generate random bytes, then call the callback with them
[11:30] jameshowe: k, thanks

[11:31] thalll has joined the channel
[11:31] josephg: if you pass a callback, it'll return immediately and call the callback when its received enough entropy
[11:31] mmalecki: jameshowe: but really, run. unless your corp provides you with a free striptease on friday night and a beer every day
[11:31] josephg: if you call it without a callback, the function will block until its received enough entropy and return with the bytes
[11:31] mmalecki: limiting people to one OS is never a good idea.
[11:32] jameshowe: i'm not
[11:32] jameshowe: but trying to support windows and linux deployments
[11:32] josephg: mmalecki: I did some work last year at google, and without special permission from on high, you can't use windows as your desktop OS at all
[11:32] jameshowe: and not force a large and scattered dev team to totally migrate
[11:32] AutomatedTester: what's the best way to access $HOME via fs?
[11:33] mmalecki: josephg: yeah, it makes sense
[11:33] mmalecki: jameshowe: if you deploy to windows, that's fine
[11:33] mmalecki: josephg: well, windows is the most insecure OS ever developed
[11:33] josephg: mmalecki: eh, not really true
[11:33] josephg: not true at all of modern windowses.
[11:34] mmalecki: josephg: man, they parse TTF in ring 0!
[11:34] mmalecki: there were few security bugs related to that
[11:34] josephg: lol really? heh‚Ä¶ I bet
[11:34] jameshowe: well one doesn't genrally use fonts on server deployments
[11:34] mmalecki: josephg: https://www.cr0.org/paper/to-jt-party-at-ring0.pdf
[11:35] lzskiss: jameshowe, windoze on public server is a harakiri
[11:35] jameshowe: that's nice
[11:35] josephg: from what I understand, if you know what you're doing and keep up to date with patches, you can lock down a windows server box reasonably effectively
[11:35] hipsters_ has joined the channel
[11:35] mmalecki: *harakiri with a kitchen knife, lol
[11:36] josephg: - if you're a huge target like google, I understand the concern, but for most people windows server works fine
[11:36] mmalecki: josephg: yeah, I bet
[11:36] josephg: ACTION shrugs
[11:36] josephg: too expensive and hard to maintain for my taste - though if I was doing .NET development I'd prefer windows for sure
[11:37] monokrome has joined the channel
[11:37] jameshowe: i shall leave you with my final thought - most server deployments don't generate enough entropy to implement multi-user crypto stuff, so maybe randomBytes should provide a urandom equivalent

[11:40] josephg: mmalecki: really??
[11:40] rendar_ has joined the channel
[11:40] SubStack: need to refactor parsley to be faster
[11:40] zomg: I sorta doubt they are running the entire stack on Mono...
[11:40] josephg: last I checked, mono was significantly slower than microsoft's .NET stack
[11:41] josephg: and it lags feature-wise
[11:41] zomg: And significantly less featurecomplete
[11:41] josephg: yeah
[11:41] tuhoojabotti: SubStack: Things could always be faster in computing.
[11:41] mmalecki: josephg: yeah, that's what I've heard. at least the founder mentioned it somewhere on the blog
[11:41] zomg: There's probably some post on their architecture in the SO blog

[12:19] HektoR: mansoor-s: so i need to identify each user which connects to node.js. I don't have authorization system, every user is "Guest". So i want to create permanent session for each user that connects, so if it connects again after few days i need to identify it...
[12:20] HektoR: mansoor-s: something like php session only permanent ...
[12:21] mansoor-s: HektoR, if you are using  express, it comes with a session middleware, but there is no "user-management" system/library that i know of at the moment. so that will need to be built from scratch
[12:21] HektoR: mansoor-s: i just need to have only one session id for user, that will never change ...
[12:21] mansoor-s: HektoR, if you want permanent, then instead of saving it to memory (or memory store like Redis) use a full on DB like mongo or mysql to save it to disk
[12:22] mansoor-s: HektoR, how will you deal with deleted cookies?
[12:22] HektoR: mansoor-s: hmm ... you're right ... that's problem ...
[12:23] jaitaiwan has joined the channel
[12:23] jbpros has joined the channel
[12:24] mansoor-s: its better to save the users information on disk say with MongoDB and use somethign like Redis for session managment. when user logs in, authentication, privilages are checked against the DB and loaded onto the users session (using say.. redis)
[12:24] mansoor-s: or not.. you dont even need an in memory storage

[13:16] Sembiance: fransoic: I agree with konobi, spending time and effort trying to make it more difficult to do is probably not worth it.
[13:16] fransoic: Sembiance: Yep, I looked at the closure compiler "ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS". I think that i will use that.

[16:25] bnoordhuis: baudehlo1: it's a chicken and egg problem, what's going to run the bootstrap js?

If you pipe from the ReadableStream immediately, you risk getting an "EPIPE, Broken pipe" error. But if you wait for data on stderr, you lose events from the ReadableStream.

[17:09] bnoordhuis: tanepiper: no, node-profiler is much more low level
[17:10] tanepiper: bnoordhuis: ok, will check it out will probably still help me trace this memory leak
[17:10] bnoordhuis: tanepiper: i should mention that v8 gutted the profiler api in recent releases so node-profiler is not as versatile as it used to be :/
[17:10] tanepiper: oh wait, so is --prof built into node now?
[17:10] eeemsi: hm‚Ä¶ the new layout on nodejs does not look good

[17:11] mmalecki: eeemsi: refresh

[17:30] cole_gillespie: friday we spoke about the issue with npm where authors incorrectly use .npmignore or just do not use it at all.
[17:30] cole_gillespie: because of that we see a huge amount of overhead sometimes when we npm install
[17:31] sylvinus_ has joined the channel
[17:31] cole_gillespie: so i created a CLI called "sift" that lets you search through your node_modules and see what files are never being used
[17:31] malkomalko has joined the channel
[17:31] tanepiper: isaacs: it was a bit obvious months ago :D

[17:31] isaacs: tanepiper: sure, but it's also a sign of things to come.  we're in like vb
[17:32] Glenjamin: and i'm in two minds about documentation
[17:32] isaacs: cole_gillespie: i see, interesting.
[17:32] isaacs: cole_gillespie: i'm going to start re-vamping the .npmignore file handling
[17:33] cole_gillespie: isaacs, cool. well i am working on a blog post to explain my rationale behind this cli and how to use it. i will ping you when it is up.
[17:33] isaacs: cole_gillespie: awesome.
[17:33] isaacs: cole_gillespie: also, it's great to see stuff like this getting sort of incubated as standalone programs
[17:33] isaacs: cole_gillespie: rather than having to bake it into npm's guts.
[17:33] isaacs: i fantasize about removing `init` and a few other things
[17:34] cole_gillespie: isaacs, i am really stoked about it actually. i have build in an option to let you visualize your node_modules

[17:46] cole_gillespie: Glenjamin, isaacs for me going through my node_modules and cleaning out the unused muck was a process that took about 3 hours. sift is a way for me to minimize the time it takes for me to analyze what is really happening inside of the node_modules folder
[17:46] isaacs: cole_gillespie: sure, i think it's probably a handy util to help find stuff when you've got an issue
[17:46] Glenjamin: cole_gillespie: in this scenario, is your node modules folder in version control?

[17:50] cole_gillespie: Glenjamin, can you explain what you mean by version control? in this scenario i have a project that has a node_modules folder where all my modules are housed.

[17:52] Neil_ has joined the channel
[17:52] cole_gillespie: Glenjamin, the project folder that contains my node_modules folder is version controlled but i always set .gitignore in the project folder to ignore node_modules
[17:52] cole_gillespie: Glenjamin, so i guess the answer to you question is no
[17:52] Glenjamin: cole_gillespie: yeah, so is the idea of the tool to identify stuff specified in package.json which isn't used?
[17:53] Glenjamin: which is different, but similar, to the issue of too many unnecessary files inside an npm package
[17:53] Glenjamin: ryah: looks snappy, but the nav is rather hidden
[17:54] tbranyen: does this mean node.js is ready for enterprise now?
[17:54] Glenjamin: what does that mean?

[17:57] tbranyen: like scary responsive
[17:57] cole_gillespie: Glenjamin, package.json is where i start to identify the modules for a given project, but you can not base all of your assumptions on what packages are being used from the package.json. I start by looking at the main and libs for a given package and then determining what is being used from there.
[17:57] Glenjamin: you should be able to "rm -rf node_modules && npm install", and have everything still work

[18:01] cole_gillespie: Glenjamin: you notice that your disc is running out of space and then see that a lot of the space is being taken up by node_module folders
[18:01] cole_gillespie: Glenjamin: start to delete unused files inside of node_modules so you can clean up disk space
[18:01] maushu|work has joined the channel
[18:02] Glenjamin: ah ok, the solution is to never "npm install <package>" when it's a dependency - always add to package.json then use "npm install"
[18:02] isaacs: Glenjamin: or npm install blah -S
[18:02] isaacs: or --save
[18:02] isaacs: (-s was taken, and means --silent)

[18:03] Glenjamin: isaacs: oh cool, didn't know about that
[18:03] dgathright has joined the channel
[18:03] cole_gillespie: Glenjamin, but how would that change the fact that the package that is being pulled into my node_modules folder still contains files that are not needed for core functionality?
[18:04] Aikar: cole_gillespie: contact the package owner if they are putting dev deps under deps
[18:04] cole_gillespie: Aikar, but they might have a great reason to put those files there
[18:04] cole_gillespie: for tests
[18:04] brianloveswords has joined the channel
[18:04] cole_gillespie: and for people to learn if they install things they have never used
[18:04] Aikar: cole_gillespie: yes, 'devDependencies' is a seperate section needed only for testing
[18:04] stisti has joined the channel
[18:05] Glenjamin: and documentation doesn't belong in the package imo
[18:05] deedubs has joined the channel
[18:05] Aikar: i disagree
[18:05] Aikar: doc is light
[18:05] Glenjamin: depends what type
[18:05] lightcap has joined the channel
[18:05] cole_gillespie: Aikar, this is why i am creating something that will expose the greatest offenders
[18:05] Glenjamin: for instance, build API docs
[18:05] Glenjamin: cole_gillespie: oh, i see now - it'd produce stats for the worst offending packages
[18:05] cole_gillespie: i am not going to take the time to contact every AUTHOR of some package that i am using and say "please delete this file"
[18:06] Glenjamin: fork + pull request :)
[18:06] Glenjamin: i think i've had to submit changes upstream for about 50% of all node module i've used :D
[18:06] Aikar: isaacs: what do you think about setting up npm test to install dev deps to /tmp and set NODE_PATH before executing to include it, so that dev deps dont land in your project folder?
[18:08] Aikar: maybe /tmp/hash_of_file_path/ so it always ends up in same location (and reduce installing every time you npm test)
[18:08] _dc has joined the channel
[18:08] aheckmann has joined the channel
[18:08] isaacs: Aikar: that sounds complicated
[18:08] Aikar: isaacs: why? seems fairly trivial to me
[18:09] isaacs: Aikar: it sounds more trivial than it is
[18:09] Aikar: CWD before installing dev deps, then include the path in NODE_PATH
[18:09] isaacs: Aikar: build it as a standalone program.
[18:09] isaacs: Aikar: that shouldn't go in npm.
[18:09] isaacs: Aikar: if you do `npm install`, it'll already install dev deps.  then if you do `npm test`, it'll just work.
[18:09] isaacs: what's the harm in having them there?
[18:10] Aikar: because not everyone follows the standard of "SCM ignore node_modules"
[18:10] `3rdEden has joined the channel
[18:10] Aikar: so devDeps are useless to me, as they end up in my scm/packages
[18:10] isaacs: Aikar: in fact, not only is that not a standard, many node developers encourage adding node_modules to git for any deployable package.
[18:10] Aikar: sorry didnt mean as a "real standard"
[18:10] Aikar: i guess i meant "practice" :P
[18:10] isaacs: many node developers includes, at least, me, mikeal, JasonSmith, etc.
[18:11] isaacs: right
[18:11] mmalecki: attention, nerdfight begins!
[18:11] isaacs: but i mean, it's not actually a good practice
[18:11] isaacs: if you're deploying something, you should absolutely add node_modules to git, and put the devdeps on your staging and production servers so that you can run tests prior to switching to the new code.
[18:11] Aikar: so npm install foo installs foos devdeps too?
[18:11] tbranyen: isaacs: i still don't get how thats supposed to work with native modules
[18:11] isaacs: Aikar: no
[18:11] isaacs: tbranyen: run `npm rebuild`
[18:11] isaacs: tbranyen: it rebuilds all your deps that have a pre/post/install script
[18:11] Aikar: thats what i mean tho, if i do npm install foo, cd node_modules/foo, npm test, now i have my proj littered
[18:12] tbranyen: isaacs: oh slick
[18:12] perezd has joined the channel
[18:12] stephank: Heh, no Joyent on the new nodejs.org? I'm a bit surprised. :B
[18:12] Glenjamin: isaacs: would you not do "npm install" as part of the process which builds the package to deploy to test/staging?
[18:12] isaacs: Glenjamin: that's a complicated question, but in general, no.
[18:12] tbranyen: stephank: huh they are on the bottom
[18:12] stephank: tbranyen: well yes, but: *scroll scroll scroll*
[18:12] Renegade001 has joined the channel
[18:13] tbranyen: stephank: ...
[18:13] Aikar: Glenjamin: I personally only use npm as a way to install modules for first time then update them
[18:13] Glenjamin: so at the moment we're droping deps into git, but i kinda feel like bundling deps should be a deploy step, alongside bundling/minifying frontend JS etc
[18:13] isaacs: Glenjamin: we've gone around on this a bit, and it hink the pattern we're seeing that works best is to deploy from a git sha or tag, since that's reproducible
[18:13] stephank: tbranyen: Would've expected a mention in the "in the industry" section, not that I mind.
[18:13] Aikar: then check them into SCM, so other devs can just checkout the project and have all the code, regardless of the state of npm and their dev env
[18:13] isaacs: for *libraries* and modules like that, that you publish to the npm registry, bundling is usually hazardous.
[18:14] isaacs: so are strict dependency versions.
[18:14] isaacs: better to be a little loose.
[18:14] Glenjamin: isaacs: we have a build task on jenkins which runs some code which creates a tag, then builds a package from that and tars it up for distribution
[18:14] isaacs: ok
[18:14] isaacs: Glenjamin: if that does `npm install` as part of its process, you can get literally anything as a result.  deploy processes should be exactly reproducible.
[18:15] isaacs: git is the tool for that.
[18:15] kraft has joined the channel
[18:15] isaacs: npm can be a part of that, but `npm install` is not reproducible-safe
[18:15] Aikar: strongly agreed, when i deploy i want to have EXACTLY the code thats been tested
[18:15] maushu|work has joined the channel
[18:15] Glenjamin: it currently doesn't, but i was thinking about doing it - thats a good point I hadn't considered
[18:15] isaacs: of course, you still probably want to use npm to do stuff locally.
[18:15] cole_gillespie: Aikar, Glenjamin, isaacs  there are many answers to the issue of understanding what is at the core of a node package. Really, it varies considerably from package to package. I just wanted a way to understand the (required) guts of my node_modules. I wanted to be able to see which packages take up the most space as well as understand what files in those packages are used an unused. The problem I am trying to solve is really simple. U
[18:15] cole_gillespie: nderstand my packages and easily rearrange or reconfigure them as i need as quickly and efficiently as possible without error.
[18:15] isaacs: install things, test things, etc.
[18:16] isaacs: cole_gillespie: a noble ambition :)
[18:16] mcluskydodallas has joined the channel
[18:16] Aikar: isaacs: why does 'npm install' install dev deps?
[18:16] jaequery has joined the channel
[18:16] Glenjamin: so even with exact dependecy versions for an app, a forced update could potentially change what a package is?
[18:16] isaacs: Aikar: because when you're local, you need to be testing, and test stuff is in dev deps.
[18:16] isaacs: Aikar: it's a development tool
[18:16] dilvie has joined the channel
[18:16] isaacs: Glenjamin: yes.
[18:17] isaacs: Glenjamin: a) those deps might not have exact version deps, b) npm publish --force can change them anyway
[18:17] Aikar: i just think having a standard of 'npm test' to test stuff would be ideal and not install packages unexpectedly
[18:17] mmalecki: isaacs: and what should we do if a package is deployable but should be also a module?
[18:17] Glenjamin: i hadn't considered that, good point
[18:17] mmalecki: like haibu.
[18:17] isaacs: Aikar: npm test doesn't install stuff.  npm install does.
[18:17] Glenjamin: mmalecki: split it?
[18:17] isaacs: mmalecki: i dunno.  trade-offs, i guess :)
[18:17] mmalecki: isaacs: this is hard!
[18:18] Glenjamin: i wish more people would use npm test, i can never figure out if "make" is going to build or run tests
[18:18] isaacs: mmalecki: hahah.  if there's another module besides haibu, i'll maybe consider it a use-case.  otherwise, it's an edge-case.
[18:18] isaacs: Glenjamin: sometimes both!
[18:18] mmalecki: isaacs: well, haibu-carapace :)

[18:20] isaacs: mmalecki: lots of xml, plenty to complain about in the api, but it's incredibly stable and battle-tested
[18:20] Glenjamin: shedinja: call .toString() on it
[18:20] mmalecki: isaacs: ok, thanks! :)
[18:20] isaacs: shedinja: do this in the repl: Function.prototype.inspect = Function.prototype.toString
[18:20] isaacs: shedinja: then it'll do that :)

[18:29] isaacs: shedinja: i'd avoid using `new String('foo')`.  that's one of javascript's bad parts
[18:29] isaacs: shedinja: better to jus use 'foo'

[18:33] isaacs: shedinja: it's wrong in any situation.
[18:33] Glenjamin: methods on a single instance only
[18:33] benvie: just call string itself without the new part
[18:33] `3rdEden: Can someone opensource the  node.js website ;$?
[18:34] benvie: constructors are reqiured to return instances of objects

[18:34] benvie: String(someval) isn't a constructor though so it does the job
[18:34] `3rdEden: unless it's checked out in a different branch then master
[18:35] Glenjamin: benvie: the problem is he wants an object that can have properties attached, but would want typeof  to return string

[18:35] isaacs: Glenjamin: i use that a lot
[18:35] Glenjamin: its almost always better to duck type and fall back to the assumtion of string, no?
[18:35] isaacs: Glenjamin: typeof x === "string" is pretty common, actually
[18:35] isaacs: Glenjamin: not always.
[18:35] shapeshed has joined the channel
[18:35] benvie: you can use Object.prototyp.toString in place of typeof, if you want to get the same result testing strings that are wrapped or unwrapped

[18:36] Glenjamin: hrm, got an example handy?
[18:36] benvie: [object String]
[18:36] Glenjamin: isaacs: i mean duck-type for non-string, else assume toString() is useful

[18:42] isaacs: Glenjamin: or in some, a funciton or a string
[18:42] isaacs: all of which will happily give me the function contents, or [object Object] if i poke at them in stringly ways.
[18:42] isaacs: typeof is good.  ti's fast, doesn't require any object-casting, handles unknown references, etc.

[22:46] kenperkins: and we're good
[22:47] isaacs: Rushing: you must express this problem in error stack traces, and possibly also in javascript
[22:47] isaacs: english = worst programming language ever.
[22:47] isaacs: (*pretty syntax, tho)

[23:44] perezd: https://gist.github.com/81c18ac7a522e64e45df
[23:44] perezd: this is a condensed version of what I am doing basically
[23:44] perezd: I never hear "SIGQUIT'D
[23:44] perezd: and as soon as 1 dies, all of them die
[23:44] perezd: with exit code 1
[23:44] perezd: signal null
[23:45] perezd: basically, node is recursively spawning a node process
[23:45] gtramontina has joined the channel
[23:45] perezd: it doesn't fire SIGQUIT signals to each child process, as I'd expect

[23:51] perezd: I am listening to it
[23:51] sh1mmer: is node throwing anything from the main process
[23:52] jaitaiwan has joined the channel
[23:52] perezd: not that I can tell
[23:52] perezd: SIGQUIT is not an exit, its just a signal
[23:52] perezd: I'd have to call process.exit() to have it truly terminate
[23:52] sh1mmer: hm
[23:52] perezd: kill != exit
[23:52] perezd: according to the docs
[23:52] sh1mmer: sure
[23:52] sh1mmer: KILL is just signal passing
[23:52] perezd: yeah it *should* be
[23:53] sh1mmer: I think I remember seeing bug about this
[23:53] sh1mmer: look in the issues on joyent/node
[23:53] CoverSlide: thou shalt not kill
[23:53] sh1mmer: other than that I don't have time to look in more details right now
[23:53] sh1mmer: but that's a reasonable test case
[23:53] sh1mmer: so I would just file it
[23:53] sh1mmer: if you can't find an existing bug
[23:53] perezd: okay
