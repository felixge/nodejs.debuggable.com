[03:15] Prometheus: niftylettuce: so you want it to basically interact with gist.github.com, that's all?
[03:15] niftylettuce: Prometheus: yeah ctrl+shift+v and it takes either selected document or selected text and pastes private gist

[03:20] qhead has joined the channel
[03:20] niftylettuce: Prometheus: that will write to there, meaning maybe you could write script that writes to a tmp file w/same extension as current document, then takes that tmp file and POSTS it to github
[03:21] Prometheus: yeah
[03:21] Prometheus: I mean a simple bash script should do it, right?

[03:22] Prometheus: niftylettuce: for example, https://github.com/rocketraman/gist.sh

[03:29] Marak: does anyone know the easiest way to "stat" a port, i.e. determine if there is a running service?
[03:29] Marak: but its not cutting it
[03:29] Marak: i've been doing some wonky process.on('uncaughtException', function (err) {   if (err.message === "EADDRINUSE, Address already in use") { 
[03:29] Aria: Heh. That sounds about right. There's no e.errno?
[03:30] Aria: or e.code? (I can't remember the property)
[03:30] tim_smart: Should be e.code
[03:30] Marak: Aria: i cant really do that, i need the exception caught on the instance of the hook, not the global state of the module
[03:30] tim_smart: But could be errno
[03:30] Marak: err, process
[03:30] Marak: i need to actually check if the port is available before i try to bind to it...
[03:30] Aria: Why? Why not bind to it and see if that fails?
[03:31] tim_smart: Marak: listen(port, callback)
[03:31] niftylettuce: i am assuming you're not talking about using netstat
[03:31] tim_smart: I'm pretty sure listen has a callback
[03:31] Marak: tim_smart: will that throw a proper err if the port isnt available?
[03:31] Marak: tim_smart: it does...im like 3 levels deep with dnode, but it should work...

[06:27] isaacs: mjr_: yes!  just the other day.  wtf?
[06:27] isaacs: that should not be possible.
[06:27] mjr_: can I help?
[06:27] isaacs: mjr_: maybe.
[06:27] isaacs: go into the repl, and do this:   require("fs").statSync("/usr").isDirectory()
[06:27] niftylettuce: hey folks tim_smart tried helping me but to no luck (he had to go) -- can anyone take a peak at this shell script for gist'ing and lmk why it keeps outputting "undefined"? https://gist.github.com/3d89da96036b2c9c8b9a
[06:27] isaacs: what does that return?
[06:27] mjr_: I also got that error about /var before, so I removed npm and started over
[06:28] mjr_: > require("fs").statSync("/usr").isDirectory()

[06:29] mjr_: I guess I could roll node back a few commits and see if that changes anything.
[06:30] isaacs: mjr_: so, this is the place where the error is happening:
[06:30] isaacs:         if (s.isDirectory()) {
[06:30] isaacs:           if (uid === null && typeof s.uid === "number") foundUID = s.uid

[06:37] mjr_: Which is strange, because the dates are totally wrong
[06:37] isaacs: yahh...
[06:37] mjr_: Maybe other stuff too, but I'm not sure about the correct values when statting directories
[06:37] isaacs: that looks *really* weird
[06:38] isaacs: mode 40??

[06:43] SamNZ: I'm having trouble with socket.io. Can anyone shed some light on why this might be happening: https://gist.github.com/1053278
[06:44] `3rdEden: the store is deleted when you disconnect so you cant access it SamNZ
[06:45] `3rdEden: #socket.io has it's own channel btw :)
[06:45] SamNZ: Well that's inconvenient
[06:45] SamNZ: Orly
[06:45] `3rdEden: Yarly
[06:45] balaa has joined the channel
[06:46] SamNZ: The store should be deleted after the disconnect event is emitted
[06:46] `3rdEden: But yeah, but fixing that is kinda hard, because disconnect is `sync` and get is async
[06:47] `3rdEden: only with the memory store, it's sync
[06:47] niftylettuce: getting a weird undefined output error to clipboard https://gist.github.com/3d89da96036b2c9c8b9a
[06:47] mjr_: isaacs: so I did a make clean && make in my node src dir, and guess what?  now npm works fine
[06:47] isaacs: nu uh!!
[06:47] isaacs: that's horrible
[06:47] mjr_: yeah
[06:47] mjr_: for real
[06:47] isaacs: ugh
[06:48] isaacs: shitstains
[06:48] mjr_: So somehow we built a completely mangled node
[06:48] isaacs: did you build some other version of it previously?
[06:48] mjr_: But one that was mangled in tiny, subtle ways
[06:48] SamNZ: The problem is I'd like to log the user out when they disconnect, but now I have no way of knowing what their user_id is
[06:48] jble has joined the channel
[06:48] isaacs: unrealistic
[06:48] mjr_: Sure, I build a new version every few days 
[06:48] isaacs: mjr_: and why just THAT stat?  i stat like a bajillion things
[06:48] isaacs: npm's a stat monster
[06:48] mjr_: Perhaps all stats were borked
[06:49] isaacs: it stats your face, just for being there
[06:49] mjr_: It died right away
[06:49] isaacs: no, that's defintely not the first stat it does.  but maybe it's the first dir it tried to create.
[06:49] mjr_: That was the very first line of output from npm, but perhaps it's the first stat that checked the mangled bit
[06:49] mjr_: anyway, totally shitty bug
[06:50] isaacs: gah.
[06:50] isaacs: well, i'm building node for teh first time in a long time on a machine that got the 10.6.8 update today
[06:50] mjr_: I get a number of bug reports from people using node_redis and hiredis where shit gets mangled when they rebuild

[06:50] sirdancealot has joined the channel
[06:50] isaacs: idon't get it
[06:50] mjr_: It's something about the build process I think.

[06:51] mjr_: If you apply the commits one at a time, maybe it gets different results?

[07:24] SamNZ: `3rdEden: I managed to hack together a solution. The disconnect event gets sent with a reason, so I sent the client store along side that before it gets deleted
[07:28] `3rdEden: SamNZ sure that will only work if you are using the in memory storage
[07:28] `3rdEden: but when you are inneed of scaling your app, you will have issues :p
[07:29] `3rdEden: Because those get/set's will be async
[07:29] Arkkis: hmm, in memory storage, I need to take a look at that, sounds promising

It's a bit of a chicken or egg thing.. until there's a request for the bundled asset it won't exist, correct? so how do you get your express app to generate an md5 seede

[17:50] lukegalea: dtan: This could very easily become a religous debate :) But IMHO, Redhat packages tend to be really old, which means that they don't tend to update and run into issues with new version that might have vulnerabilities or bugs, but if you are using an "emerging technology"  the old version is likely way buggier and less secure than the new version.

We have to maintain our own private yum repo for fedora that includes updated versions of things like imagemagick, etc. But if you can get by with just building nginx, node, etc then I wouldn't kill yourself.

[18:03] scoates: I have a wrapper for an HTTP client. Now, it just gathers the response in a non-blocking way (and calls a callback). I'd like to (at the cost of blocking) be able to do this: `$_.get(url).username`   where $_.get(url) returns an object, and `.username` dereferences the username element.

[20:32] dgathright has joined the channel
[20:32] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: stack trace leads back to res.render("login.ejs", {locals: { blah: bloo } })
[20:32] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: that's node's lovely way to letting you know you responded twice usually due to bugs causing double callbacks etc
[20:32] tjholowaychuk: hmm
[20:32] isaacs: hm.
[20:33] isaacs: worked fine on express 1.0
[20:33] tjholowaychuk: that's because node failed silently
[20:33] tjholowaychuk: we had a bug in mongoose for example that would do a few queries blah blah and end up at times invoking the callback more than once
[20:33] tjholowaychuk: so res.render()ing more than once
[20:33] isaacs: hm... looks like the static middleware is getting an ENOENT
[20:34] tjholowaychuk: it's lame too because I think getHeader() still bitches after the header is sent
[20:34] robi42 has joined the channel
[20:34] tjholowaychuk: so you can't use it in logger() or similar
[20:35] isaacs: yeah, so, if i'm understanding this correctly, going to /login is causing the static middleware to look for /public/login, that's failing, so it's trying to 500, and at the same time, the login.ejs is trying to send its contents
[20:36] mandric has joined the channel

[21:09] ekryski: I have to say I do like living here overall. Lots of space but I've never been to vic
[21:09] Murvin: ekryski:  i see.  then it will be tough..  because short burst is better to handle in cloud.   
[21:09] dtan: ok, was about to ask
[21:09] Murvin: dtan: yes.. libssl-dev  typo
[21:10] Murvin: bnoordhuis: thanks. lol. typo
[21:10] dtan: yup np
[21:10] dtan: haha two in a row
[21:10] dtan: k installed
[21:10] dtan: now i should be able to ./configure?
[21:10] ekryski: Murvin: you think so? Just because you can spin up more instances?
[21:10] Murvin: yes.
[21:10] dtan: sweet
[21:10] dtan: thanks murvin
[21:10] Murvin: ekryski:  yes.  
[21:11] Murvin: dtan:  np.  
[21:11] bnoordhuis: Murvin: about https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/1176 - do you experience the hangups in the client or the server?
[21:11] dtan: oh but in the output, it says "checking for openssl: not found"
[21:11] dtan: is that expected?
[21:11] ekryski: Murvin: or the guys could just buy more servers.  If we get big enough we'll probably have our own mini server farm. We're in talks with some big telecom providers
[21:12] bnoordhuis: dtan: can you gist or pastie the complete log?
[21:12] Murvin: bnoordhuis:  the problems are always in the server making http.request (client request) call.   
[21:12] dtan: sure
[21:12] nrajlich has joined the channel
[21:12] Murvin: ekryski: buy more servers is not the good way to handle burst.  
[21:12] bnoordhuis: Murvin: so if i have a server that does a request to another server and i hammer it hard with `ab`, it should manifest itself?
[21:12] Murvin: ekryski: because u never know how big the spike is.
[21:13] dtan: bnoordhuis, murvin: https://gist.github.com/1054996
[21:13] Nexxy: Murvin: I've heard that before
[21:13] Murvin: bnoordhuis: correct.   let say serverA  makes http.request to  serverB.   serverB just send back simple data.
[21:13] necrodearia has joined the channel
[21:13] jerrysv: this problem looks familiar
[21:13] Murvin: bnoordhuis:  and serverB will always survive.. have no problem at all.
[21:13] bnoordhuis: dtan: you're good to go, it detected the openssl dev headers
[21:14] dtan: k
[21:14] bnoordhuis: Murvin: okay, thanks
[21:14] Murvin: bnoordhuis:  the socket hang up , or socket "Use Up" problem is on serverA that establishing http.request
[21:14] materialdesigner has joined the channel
[21:15] ekryski: Murvin: Fair enough. Can you configure ec2 to automatically spin up another instanceor do you have to do it manually?
[21:15] dtan: bnoordhuis - so that "no openssl" is expected?
[21:15] Murvin: dtan:  so,  openssl not found?
[21:15] ekryski: Murvin: we also can't really afford to have any down time.
[21:15] MattJ: ekryski: it's possible, via 3rd party services if it isn't built-in now (I think it is)
[21:15] dtan: that's what the output says, but bnoordhuis is saying it's ok
[21:16] ekryski: thanks MattJ
[21:16] bnoordhuis: dtan: yes, sort of - ./configure doesn't detect openssl on my machine either but node builds fine (with ssl support)
[21:16] dtan: ah ok, cool
[21:16] Murvin: ekryski:  you have to set up in EC2, and it will spawn new micro instance when needs.  and automatically stop the instance when no more spike
[21:16] dtan: just wanted to make sure it was correct

[21:18] Prometheus: Murvin: that's no excuse =P

[21:20] Prometheus: Murvin: it's called automation

[21:48] Nexxy: RickardL, out of curiosity, are you involved in the payment processing code?
[21:49] Murvin: if you have a nice separate between front end (html, js,etc) and backend logic, especially if most data is from ajax, the backend can be done in Node easily.

[22:01] bnoordhuis: RickardL: take the visitor pattern for example, not necessary as you can pass functions around
[22:01] jesusabdullah: also, SF has its share of hipsters
[22:01] jerrysv: probably just run-off from here
[22:03] RickardL: bnoordhuis: Aye, that's true but most other like proxy, composite adapter etc are still valid ones

[22:12] Murvin: use Chrom
[22:12] Murvin: use Chrome.
[22:12] vineethkashyap: yes
[22:12] vineethkashyap: i tried chrom, safari
[22:12] vineethkashyap: neither worked
[22:12] Murvin: hmm u don't have to do this  debug?port-=5858
[22:12] Murvin: just do 127.0.0.1:8080
[22:12] vineethkashyap: oh, let me try that
[22:13] Murvin: and make sure u run the server:   node  --debug-brk  mynode..js
[22:13] xeodox has joined the channel
[22:14] justinw312 has joined the channel
[22:15] Murvin: when you run with --debug-brk,  the browser (:8080)  will be blocked at the first line.   so, you can set the break point.
[22:16] vineethkashyap: oh ok
[22:16] justinw312: I'm working on a toy project which among other things will involve a moderate sized key/value store of strings. I want very fast access to the data, so I want to store it in process. I also want this to run well on VPS/Cloud hosting, so memory footprint is an issue.
[22:16] vineethkashyap: so need to add debugger; statements?

[22:17] Murvin: yes
[22:17] vineethkashyap: 1. node inspector,.js
[22:18] vineethkashyap: and 2. node --debug-brk file-i-want-to-debug.js?
[22:18] Murvin: yes.. step 1)   node-inspector&
[22:18] justinw312: Obviously written language is very very compressible 
[22:18] Murvin: step 2)  node --debug-brk  whatever-server.js

[22:18] mscdex: :-D
[22:19] Tobsn: does anyone know of a mysql server protocol implementation
[22:19] mscdex: Tobsn: yeah, the one in C
[22:19] mscdex: ;)
[22:19] Tobsn: besides the one in C ;)
[22:19] Murvin: step 4) run the page that serve by your wahtever-server.js   e.g.   myIP:3000/
[22:19] Tobsn: i want a mysql server in node.js
[22:19] bradleymeck_: Tobsn nodemysql by felixge?
[22:19] Tobsn: server
[22:19] mscdex: Tobsn: nah, because mysql is a beast
[22:19] Tobsn: not client
[22:19] dgathright has joined the channel
[22:19] Tobsn: damnit
[22:19] bradleymeck_: the protocol is borked
[22:19] Tobsn: we're gonna buy some closed source shit
[22:19] vineethkashyap: murvin: oh i see what the problem is
[22:20] Tobsn: and it only supports fucking mysql
[22:20] Tobsn: i want to write a mysql query to mongodb wrapper
[22:20] Tobsn: :P
[22:20] vineethkashyap: i am using node.js to run some javascript file
[22:20] vineethkashyap: not a server
[22:20] mscdex: so why not use mysql then?
[22:20] vineethkashyap: its a static analysis engine
[22:20] Tobsn: erm
[22:20] Tobsn: mysql SUCKS.
[22:20] Tobsn: and we will put way too much traffic on it
[22:20] vineethkashyap: written in javascript 
[22:20] mscdex: riiiiight
[22:20] vineethkashyap: that i am trying to debug
[22:20] Murvin: oh.. you serve assets by node.js? 
[22:20] Tobsn: mscdex, yeah right trust me
[22:20] Murvin: lol.  then use firebug. :)
[22:21] Tobsn: im talking 12k impressions a second in avg.
[22:21] vineethkashyap: no, this is a javascript file
[22:21] Tobsn: and im not gonna run a software over mysql doing a ton of queries every single request
[22:21] vineethkashyap: that does analysis on javascript
[22:21] Tobsn: its building a wrapper and using mongodb or buying 20 mysql servers and trying to get them together with NDB
[22:21] vineethkashyap: since node.js can run any javascript file
[22:21] Tobsn: and im not happy about that
[22:21] vineethkashyap: i can run this program too
[22:22] vineethkashyap: i cant run the program in the browser
[22:22] Murvin: oh.. command line only?
[22:22] vineethkashyap: yes
[22:22] vineethkashyap: the debugger in node is pretty decent
[22:22] Murvin: then, it may not work.. because node inspector .. i think is for server that listen to port.    
[22:22] RickardL: Tobsn: http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/SQL+to+Mongo+Mapping+Chart
[22:22] Murvin: :)
[22:22] vineethkashyap: but it says print command does not work
[22:22] Tobsn: lol
[22:22] vineethkashyap: !!
[22:23] Murvin: hmm
[22:23] Tobsn: RickardL, server protocol
[22:23] Tobsn: not sql comparison
[22:23] vineethkashyap: so i can see the call stack trace
[22:23] vineethkashyap: and step into things
[22:23] RickardL: I see
[22:23] vineethkashyap: but not inspect anything
[22:23] vineethkashyap: so i need to keep stopping, putin console.log's on what i need to inspect

[22:55] xerox: level09 but if you need to send data as json you will have to make compatible datw

[22:55] hornairs: have you tried node inspector?
[22:56] bradleymeck_: eguest309, that is a very hard to answer question depending on your db (is the logic in db or in memory), are you throttling/cleaning up, are you keeping connections open rather than opening them constantly

[22:56] vineethkashyap: standalone

[23:14] catphive: I want to wrap a library that does RTP
[23:14] AvianFlu: catphive: how much do you know about v8 and about templates in C++
[23:15] catphive: I've done the v8 tutorial, and I know c++ and templates pretty well
[23:15] AvianFlu: then you should be cool
[23:15] vineethkashyap: bnoordhuis: rebuilding it worked :)
[23:15] catphive: I was more worried about how to plug into libev, and have callbacks when I get a response on the network

[23:22] mikeycgto: i wrote some code to drop privs if my app is run as root (after it binds to port 80)
[23:22] mikeycgto: basically, if no uid is supplied to setuid as, it calls process.exit(1)
[23:23] mikeycgto: but it doesnt actually exit (it does however, close the network connections, which is good and sort of the point of my code)
[23:23] mikeycgto: any ideas?
