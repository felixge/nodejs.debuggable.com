[00:11] jhurliman: but looking at that stack trace, i have no idea where in my code i should be inserting a try/catch

[00:12] TheJH: jhurliman, could you gist your code?
[00:12] jhurliman: TheJH, unfortunately it's a large codebase that i haven't been able to boil down to a small repro yet. i'm using the request library
[00:13] TheJH: jhurliman, which node version are you using?
[00:13] jhurliman: right now i'm mostly curious on how to interpret that stack trace. all of the files/methods in the stack trace are internal to node, suggesting that there is no way to catch that error?
[00:13] jhurliman: 0.4.9
[00:14] Sorella_ has joined the channel
[00:14] TheJH: jhurliman, you can catch the error by adding an error handler to a request or so
[00:14] jhurliman: ahh, right
[00:15] jhurliman: thank you. i must be making an http request somewhere without attaching an error handler, so it falls back to throwing an exception
[00:15] TheJH: jhurliman, yes. but I think that mikeals request does that for you
[00:15] clockwize: should I connect to mongodb, then start a web server and use it in requests or open a connection per request?
[00:16] TheJH: jhurliman, at least if you always give it a callback
[00:16] jhurliman: i wish that branch of node that could show stack traces across async callbacks was functional
[00:16] TheJH: jhurliman, yes, that would be cool
[00:17] jhurliman: right now all of the errors i get from node have a stack trace of two or three lines showing internal node code. "something went wrong somewhere in your 20,000 lines of code. go find it!"

[01:28] FireFly|n900: coffeescript classes are just a thin wrapper over the prototype OOP model in JS though. If you'd like to know how it actually works I suggest learning about JS OOP as well
[01:28] mnaser: i've done tons of ruby/python oop but javascript seems pretty differnet..
[01:29] mscdex: you can pass in instance specific values into the constructor and save them as instance variables
[01:29] Nuck: Yeah, prototypes aren't classes lol

[01:30] mscdex: i stopped quoting the term long ago ;-)

[02:12] mnaser: So if I want to send "classes" across, what would I have to do?
[02:12] agnat has joined the channel
[02:12] mnaser: or if I wanted to manipulate them rather
[02:12] jesusabdullah: I'm not sure that's something dnode does
[02:12] jesusabdullah: I'd hate to say "rethink the problem"
[02:13] jesusabdullah: I really do
[02:13] mnaser: >_<
[02:13] Nuck: jesusabdullah: But you're saying it anyways?
[02:13] jesusabdullah: but I think you can find a way to do this with an instantiated object
[02:13] jesusabdullah: Nuck: Yeah >_<
[02:13] jesusabdullah: mnaser: Can you expose a getter/setter or something?
[02:13] jesusabdullah: SubStack might have some advice if he's not too busy
[02:13] tuhoojabotti: ffuuu
[02:14] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Does he ever NOT have advice?
[02:14] mnaser: what I was doing was: "volume = new Volume zpool, item" and "callback null, volume"
[02:14] Nuck: ewww CS
[02:14] jesusabdullah: Nuck: sometimes!
[02:14] mnaser: well you highlighted him so if he ever has an answer I think he'll drop by I guess
[02:14] jesusabdullah: volume = new Volume(zpool, item) ?
[02:14] jesusabdullah: and cb(null, volume) ?
[02:15] mnaser: yes
[02:15] tuhoojabotti: Hueg thunderstorm!
[02:15] jesusabdullah: and you want to access volume's prototype remotely?
[02:15] Nuck: jesusabdullah: If he doesn't have advice, then there's something wrong with the topic.
[02:15] polotek: mnaser: why can't you load your prototype definitions on the other side?
[02:15] polotek: do you not control that environment as well?
[02:15] tuhoojabotti: It's  5 am ffs
[02:15] jesusabdullah: Nuck: He just looks busy is all
[02:15] jesusabdullah: hacking the shit out of that Gibson!
[02:16] jesusabdullah: Meanwhile, I'm drawing the Wonder Twins
[02:16] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Doesn't mean he doesn't have advice, just means he's too busy to give it ;)
[02:16] mnaser: I do, I could set it up on the other side, but then i'd have logic over two applications
[02:16] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Wonder Twins?
[02:16] mnaser: and yes jesusabdullah
[02:16] unomi has joined the channel
[02:17] mnaser: basically i want to get an "object" and then once I have that object, I can do things with it, like object.update / object.resize / etc
[02:17] polotek: mnaser: if you could send your classes with all their functionality then you'd have that anyway
[02:17] mnaser: I could just make a bunch of functions like resizevolume(...) -- but i think it'd be so much cleaner
[02:18] mnaser: polotek: part of the other reason is that ill be using dnode-ruby to work with the results
[02:18] polotek: whether you load the code on both sides or send it across the wire, you're going to have to instantiate the functions twice
[02:18] mnaser: so its hard to have the prototypes there
[02:18] Nuck: mnaser: ... Ruby?
[02:18] Nuck: ACTION vomits
[02:19] jesusabdullah: Pffsht, ruby's not THAT bad
[02:19] mnaser: Nuck: seriously, every comment you do is "ewww ruby" "ewww coffeescript" -- it'd be a lot more useful if there was constructive-ness in what you say
[02:19] polotek: you could serialize all your known prototypes and send those over
[02:19] jesusabdullah: it's just got a boring ecosystem is all!
[02:19] Nuck: jesusabdullah: It is for me.
[02:19] polotek: you could toString your functions and send those as well
[02:19] polotek: but you'd lose closures
[02:19] jesusabdullah: Nuck: How do you feel about python?
[02:19] polotek: and probably open security holes :)
[02:19] jesusabdullah: :v
[02:19] mnaser: ruby is a really good language.  rails is really solid framework.
[02:19] Nuck: mnaser: There's two things I hate more than anything else in the programming world:  Ruby and CoffeeScript.
[02:19] jesusabdullah: rails lives up to its name
[02:19] jesusabdullah: fbofw
[02:19] Nuck: jesusabdullah: It's powerful, but I'm not a fan of the syntax.
[02:20] mnaser: polotek: what would you do if it was your call?
[02:20] Nuck: jesusabdullah: As for RAILS... Rails is just a piece of shit.
[02:20] Nuck: It really does not scale well.
[02:20] mnaser: Nuck: im sorry

[02:20] jesusabdullah: I call it RAYLEZZ cause that's more gangster
[02:20] mnaser: lol
[02:20] Nuck: IT used to be all "RAILS SCALES" then everybody realized it really DOESN'T scale.
[02:20] mnaser: oh god
[02:20] jesusabdullah: RAILS SCALES KINDA
[02:20] Aria: Heh. It's a classic frontend language. It scales as well as any of 'em.

[02:21] rachelderp: RAILS SCALES (down)
[02:21] Prometheus: wait
[02:21] Nuck: Then it jsut fucks itself
[02:21] Aria: "Keep your requests from talking to each other and add more web front ends."
[02:21] Prometheus: did someone call rails a solid framework?
[02:21] Nuck: scales to like 50 users
[02:21] mnaser: what else would you use to create an online app with an ORM/etc
[02:21] jesusabdullah: Your MOM scales to 50 users >:o
[02:21] mnaser: seriously, it's the best choice. imho.
[02:21] jesusabdullah: mnaser: node.js?
[02:21] Nuck: mnaser: Uh, Node.js
[02:21] Prometheus: lol.
[02:21] jesusabdullah: haha
[02:21] Prometheus: :/
[02:21] Nuck: Seriously
[02:21] Nuck: NODE scales.
[02:21] AAA_awright: LOL
[02:21] mnaser: and how the hell are you going to write an entire application
[02:21] Nuck: And it does so damn well.
[02:22] Nuck: mnaser: Easily?
[02:22] mnaser: alright then
[02:22] Nuck: mnaser: /me points to LearnBoost.
[02:22] Prometheus: mnaser: you can't be serious
[02:22] Nuck: 'nuff said.
[02:22] Prometheus: did you come from PHP to ruby?
[02:22] mnaser: to each his own guys, i just find node.js might drive you nuts on lareg projects
[02:22] Prometheus: or just picked up ruby as your first language?
[02:22] Prometheus: just out of curiosity
[02:22] jesusabdullah: The one thing I'll point out is that apparently sqlite and node don't play well together
[02:22] Prometheus: because you seem to be giving rails a lot of credit there
[02:22] Nuck: mnaser: I'm using Node.js to build a whole fucking art community.
[02:22] AvianFlu: fuck SQL, seriously
[02:22] AAA_awright: Yeah you want to abvoid that combo
[02:22] jesusabdullah: also, that node doesn't have a "heavyweight" framework a la RAYLEZ or the jangoes
[02:22] Nuck: Can't get much bigger than that.
[02:22] mnaser: jeez
[02:23] mnaser: so drop sql
[02:23] mnaser: drop rails

[02:23] Nuck: mnaser: Node.js + MongoDB.
[02:23] AAA_awright: It's great for running statistics and such
[02:23] Nuck: THEN profit.
[02:23] AvianFlu: you're in #Node.js! we did! lol
[02:23] gazumps has joined the channel
[02:23] jesusabdullah: Well, sql isn't that bad, it just fits a particular problem set
[02:23] Nuck: jesusabdullah: We have Express lol
[02:23] jesusabdullah: and mongo/redis/whatever-the-fuck might fit your needs better
[02:23] Nuck: jesusabdullah: A VERY particular set of problems.
[02:23] polotek: express isn't nearly as feature rich as rails
[02:23] polotek: which is a good thing
[02:23] Nuck: Which Mongo tends to fit just fine too.
[02:23] jesusabdullah: Nuck: express is more comparable to sinatra
[02:23] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Ah true
[02:24] dgathright has joined the channel
[02:24] mnaser: anyways
[02:24] Nuck: jesusabdullah: We have underscore, is that more like django?
[02:24] Aria: HEh, I kinda love node too. Express is awesome that way.
[02:24] jesusabdullah: Naw, that's more like the "standard library"

[02:24] jesusabdullah: mnaser: It's just that rails is a pretty divisive topic
[02:24] Prometheus: =P
[02:24] Prometheus: rails happens.
[02:25] Nuck: We'll just laugh at your choices.
[02:25] jesusabdullah: You mean raylezz
[02:25] Nuck: Prometheus: It happens?  LMAO
[02:25] jesusabdullah: Okay, drew Zan
[02:25] ^robertj: is there a way to make a blocking generator and then feed it values to yield?
[02:25] jesusabdullah: Now, Janya
[02:25] jesusabdullah: the hot one!
[02:25] Nuck: ^robertj: Elaborate?
[02:25] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Who the fuck?
[02:25] mnaser: to be honest, i think that for huge applications, it's really hard to design them in node
[02:25] ^robertj: Nuck, I'v got a StringReader I am trying to turn into a blocking socket reader
[02:25] mnaser: again, im not a node.js expert
[02:26] mscdex: rails isn't as divisive as matlab is
[02:26] polotek: mnaser: that's because node is a platform, not a framework
[02:26] Nuck: mnaser: You get used to it :P
[02:26] polotek: express is a framework
[02:26] mscdex: and labview
[02:26] egeste has left the channel
[02:26] polotek: just seems it's not as extensive as you would like
[02:26] mnaser: and rails is blocking, i know.  but yeah, i even saw express, it looks very sinatra like
[02:26] mnaser: that's what i personally think ,rails is a really good groundbase for an app, it has tons of things that's there to help speed up progrmaming
[02:26] mscdex: a platform on a platform!
[02:26] polotek: mnaser: write your own framework. it'll take a long time before it's as extensive as rails
[02:27] mnaser: now if it's the best to do it, might not be, but rails does a great job for it's purpose
[02:27] polotek: but somebody's gotta do it
[02:27] Nuck: mnaser: Once you learn how scope and whatnot work in JS, it's very simple to deal with callbacks.
[02:27] ^robertj: Nuck, so I need a way to wait when there is a peek()
[02:27] Nuck: mnaser: I hate Ruby.  It's my worst enemy.
[02:27] Nuck: ^robertj: I'm afraid that's a bit above my level.
[02:27] mnaser: ruby is a lot better than many of the languages out there
[02:27] polotek: ^robertj: can you use an event emitter?
[02:27] Prometheus: ...
[02:27] Prometheus: please make it stop :/
[02:27] AAA_awright: I wonder if I could write a log parser that analyzes for contervercial topics
[02:27] Nuck: mnaser: You MUST be a convert from PHP.
[02:28] ^robertj: polotek, dunno, can the listeners be blocking?
[02:28] Nuck: I can't think of any other reason you'd consider it a great lenaguage.
[02:28] AAA_awright: Nuck: I still work in PHP because there's no better content management system.
[02:28] polotek: ^robertj: there is no blocking i/o in node
[02:28] mscdex: PHP is now a recursive acronym for People Hating PHP
[02:28] mscdex: ;-)
[02:28] Nuck: AAA_awright: Fair enough
[02:28] polotek: listeners are functions
[02:28] ^robertj: polotek, not in node btw
[02:28] Nuck: mscdex: lol
[02:28] AAA_awright: And it's a pretty good template language, if someone would write a PHP template engine for Node.js
[02:28] polotek: ^robertj: then I'm confused
[02:28] Prometheus: AAA_awright: PHP is a CMS?
[02:28] Nuck: ^robertj: Then why are you asking us?
[02:28] AAA_awright: Prometheus: Drupal
[02:29] Prometheus: oh
[02:29] Nuck: AAA_awright: EJS.
[02:29] ^robertj: doh wrong channel, thought i was in #javascript
[02:29] ^robertj: wasn't paying attention :P
[02:29] mscdex: huh?
[02:29] AAA_awright: Nuck: Eh maybe
[02:29] Nuck: AAA_awright: I picked EJS as my template engine simply because it has the nice PHP-esque syntax.
[02:29] Prometheus: AAA_awright: I'm sure there are, you just haven't come across them yet =)
[02:29] Stythys: http://refinerycms.com/
[02:29] mscdex: ^robertj: what blocking javascript out there is it that you're using?
[02:29] Nuck: AAA_awright: I too love the <?php ?> stuff, it's very nice.
[02:30] mnaser: how good is the video that's on nodejs homepage?  i feel like with how strong-minded everyone is about this, i might be missing something

[02:30] DrPizza_: building in VC++.
[02:30] ^robertj: mscdex, it's a javascript sgml parser
[02:30] DrPizza_: excellent.
[02:30] mnaser: well, not crap, but let's just say, convincing
[02:30] Nuck: markbao_: You posted a screencap earlier of your Mongo thing... What is that interface, it looks awesome?
[02:30] DrPizza_: now to make it tidy.
[02:31] mnaser: does it cover a good variety of node?

[02:31] Nuck: markbao_" Thanks :D
[02:31] Prometheus: mnaser: it's a bit more than just hello world =)
[02:32] mnaser: good.  i'm getting tired and frustrated as shit, i'll probably scratch all i did for today because it's gone no where
[02:32] markbao_: no worries Nuck :D
[02:32] Prometheus: about 30 minutes of hello world =P
[02:32] mnaser: i'll give it a watch before hitting the sack
[02:32] mnaser: but just a heads up, im not trolling anyone with ruby or anything, i wasn't trying to push anyone's buttons
[02:32] mnaser: just fyi
[02:32] Prometheus: mnaser: understandable, you are not the only person to come to node.js from ruby =)
[02:32] polotek: mnaser: your frustration is understandable. if you want to focus on application logic, you're going to have a tough time with node
[02:32] mscdex: mnaser: also i'd bet more people use pure js rather than cs
[02:33] polotek: it's still very new and doesn't have all the tools of a ruby or python
[02:33] mscdex: at least in here
[02:33] Nuck: polotek: That's intentional
[02:33] mnaser: yeah.. my application logic is _really_ not that hard...
[02:33] polotek: not to mention that those tools are more difficult to port because of the async nature of node
[02:33] polotek: vs. those other platforms
[02:33] mnaser: literally, all this node.js application is a frontend API service that recieves a request, then executes a command locally depending on the request
[02:33] Nuck: polotek: Meh, I've gotten used to the async nature of Node.
[02:33] mscdex: mnaser: that's pretty easy to do
[02:34] Nuck: mnaser: REST api?
[02:34] mnaser: get new volume command, run 'zfs create ...." with parameters, tada.
[02:34] Prometheus: try doing that in rails
[02:34] Prometheus: =)
[02:34] mnaser: rails would be overkill for that obviously
[02:34] mnaser: not even the right tool
[02:34] Prometheus: but you said... =P
[02:34] mnaser: i thought of REST API but didnt find good modules, i was suggested dnode (initially i was using the xmlrpc module)
[02:34] dgathright has joined the channel
[02:35] mscdex: you could use express too instead of a specialized module
[02:35] Nuck: mnaser: If you want to make a simple REST API, look at Express.  You jsut toss back JSON as the response and it'll handle it.
[02:35] mscdex: depending on your needs
[02:35] Nuck: I'm building a REST API using it
[02:35] mnaser: but if there's any good restful routers having /pools/mypool/volumes/myvolume
[02:35] mscdex: yeah
[02:35] mnaser: exprss is good to build rest apis?  it seems to me like it had too much
[02:35] mscdex: express is really flexible
[02:35] mnaser: guess i need to give it more of a shot
[02:35] Nuck: mnaser: I thought the same thing, but it really feels lightweight when you're using it.
[02:36] mnaser: it really sucks because i know node is a good option but the time i've lost just figuring out "the right way" to do it
[02:36] Aria: Express is really not that big.
[02:36] Aria: And it's very modular.
[02:36] Nuck: For a rather powerful library, Express feels really lightweight, because as Aria says, it's modular.
[02:36] Nuck: You only use what you need.
[02:36] Aria: And even all of it just isn't that much.
[02:36] Nuck: yep
[02:37] Nuck: because tj is awesome like that :P
[02:37] polotek: mnaser: what is it you're having trouble with exactly?
[02:37] Aria: He really is. I have a lot of respect for him.
[02:37] polotek: you need to understand how node thinks about http
[02:37] Nuck: Aria: Who doesn't?  It's like NPM levels of awesome.
[02:37] polotek: seems to me a simple rest endpoint shouldn't require something like dnode
[02:37] polotek: how did you end up there?
[02:38] mnaser: basically i have a small api endpoint that runs there, not necesarily rest, i thought of rest, express "looked" big so i looked for some rest modules, didnt have luck
[02:38] mnaser: then I just found a good xmlrpc plugin, started using it, was told about dnode and how it might be better, checked out dnode ruby bindings, and so on
[02:38] mnaser: I need to be able to interact with the API using ruby, we still have a huge app that needs to continue to run till we slowly port and move things over
[02:38] Nuck: if you want to have arguments in the path, you can do "/pools/:pool/volumes/:volume/" as the path in app.get();
[02:39] Nuck: mnaser: Just call the API through Ruby
[02:39] mscdex: or you can use custom regex if you need something really fancy
[02:39] chrislorenz has joined the channel
[02:39] mnaser: it's only used by our manager so not too much to worry about
[02:39] Nuck: Probably not the most efficient means of communication, but I'd imagine it ought to be sufficient.
[02:39] mnaser: we control the input
[02:40] mnaser: well, what would be the 100% efficent way, that's what i'm looking for, honestly.

[02:40] mnaser: haha, had to deal with that for a while
[02:40] mnaser: (autocorrect)
[02:40] Nuck: The thing is, you'd hafta do inter-process communcation, which is generally a bitch.
[02:41] Nuck: Aria: Oh fuck, Lion added autocorrect?
[02:41] mnaser: by inter-process communication .. ?
[02:41] Aria: Yeah, but it's able to be turned off.
[02:41] Nuck: mnaser: Wait, are these on two separate machines?
[02:41] mnaser: yes, that's why i want a small frontend on the other machine
[02:41] Nuck: mnaser: Will the Ruby app be communicating via a network connection with the Node app?
[02:41] mnaser: so the main can send commands to it
[02:41] Nuck: Okay, then the API calls will be most efficient.
[02:42] mnaser: rails app <-- internal network --> node.js api frontend
[02:42] Nuck: Only real overhead is HTTP itself, but that's EXTREMELY Minimal.

[02:51] systemfault: POST is for that.
[02:51] Aria: And it'd be JUST that, unlike post.

[02:51] Aria: No, POST Is "have some data, not idempotent"
[02:51] Aria: Which people use for create.
[02:52] Nuck: What purpose is a CREATE?
[02:52] Nuck: I really don't see the use-case.
[02:53] Nuck: Where's the place to lodge feature requests for Node?
[02:53] Nuck: I want an mktmp.
[02:53] brainproxy: Nuck: perhaps propose your idea/s in the google group
[02:53] Nuck: brainproxy: Blargh.
[02:53] brainproxy: and see what folks think
[02:53] SubStack: Nuck: oh I know a place... it's called npm :p
[02:53] Nuck: SubStack: Surprisingly, no mktemp modules.
[02:54] SubStack: write one!
[02:54] Nuck: SubStack: I don't do C.
[02:54] Nuck: And I dunno if there's an async mktemp equivalent.
[02:54] brianseeders has joined the channel
[02:54] Aria: Create? How about MKCOL foo/, then CREATE foo/ \n Suggested-Filename: bar.txt
[02:54] Aria: An you get back a 201 Created; Location foo/bar2.txt
[02:54] SubStack: Nuck: can't you just fs.writeFileSync('/tmp/' + Math.random(), body) ?
[02:55] jerrysv has joined the channel
[02:55] Nuck: SubStack: As I understand, mktemp generates a temporary file which will be deleted when unlinked.
[02:55] Nuck: Not sure if /tmp/ works the same way
[02:56] systemfault: Nuck: The name..
[02:56] polotek: It won't on windows
[02:56] SubStack: process.on('exit', fn)?
[02:56] polotek: which means it won't on node pretty soon
[02:56] Nuck: SubStack: I don't ever exit
[02:56] Nuck: This is for an uploading API
[02:57] Nuck: I just want a simple way to create files which I won't bother with the name, I just get passed a file descriptor from the middleware
[02:58] Nuck: Basically, the file gets uploaded, a file is created, a fiel descriptor is kept, but the file is unlinked, so once that descriptor is garbage collected, the file will fade from existence.
[02:58] brownies has joined the channel
[02:59] Aria: Why do it that way?
[02:59] brainproxy: Nuck: maybe node-formidable could be adapted to that purpose?
[02:59] tj has joined the channel
[02:59] Aria: with node, you have access to the data as it comes in in the first place.
[02:59] Nuck: lolnetsplit
[03:00] Guest92009: mnaser: look at the size of the code before assuming such things :p as far as frameworks go express is tiny
[03:00] Nuck: Aria: Because it's hard to use it as a file in that form
[03:00] Aria: Ah. What do you want to do with it?
[03:00] mscdex: netsplat
[03:00] Aria: (It's a lot like node's interface to a file… it's a stream.)
[03:01] mnaser: Guest92009: i am doing a bit more reading now.. let's just say i have a lot to learn and not a lot of time
[03:01] mnaser: which is frustrating
[03:01] polotek: Nuck, you're basically describing how PHP does uploads right?
[03:01] Nuck: Guest92009: What's up with the lack of nick?
[03:01] Guest92009: irc is being a douche
[03:01] polotek: mnaser: if you're pressed for time, why would you decide to try and learn node before getting your project done?
[03:01] Nuck: Guest92009
[03:02] Nuck: I see

[03:02] Nuck: Yowch
[03:02] Nuck: polotek: Basically, yes.
[03:02] gqlewis_ has joined the channel
[03:02] mnaser: polotek: i learn quickly, it's javascript at heart, and it's not that big of a project to be something that i would never think of using node for
[03:02] Nuck: polotek: I want my uploads to be transparent, and then I just deal with my file descriptor.
[03:02] mnaser: at least i think it's a good simple thing to start with
[03:02] polotek: mnaser: apparently not, or you wouldn't be having so much trouble :)
[03:02] tjholowaychuk has joined the channel
[03:02] polotek: node runs javascript
[03:03] Nuck: brainproxy: I am looking at formidable though, but I'm not sure how I'd go about it :/
[03:03] polotek: but it introduces some seriously new constructs
[03:03] mnaser: haha, i'm just 3-4 days in.  i promise i'll get it all down!
[03:03] mnaser: heh
[03:03] polotek: those of us who are fans of node find those constructs pretty intuitive and nice to use
[03:03] polotek: but it shouldn't be taken lightly I guess
[03:03] Nuck: polotek: I sure do.

[03:07] mnaser: googling that now
[03:07] polotek: Nuck: you could approximate your upload thing in pure js
[03:07] brainproxy: http://www.nodebeginner.org/
[03:07] polotek: your middleware would create a tmp filename and stream the file there
[03:07] brainproxy: you can read it free online, or buy a pdf
[03:07] polotek: set a listener on response "end" and delete the file
[03:08] mnaser: ill check it out today
[03:08] Nexxy has joined the channel
[03:08] Nuck: polotek: Will it still exist if I keep a file descriptor but delete it?
[03:08] Aria: In unix, yes. Windows doesn't allow this.
[03:08] Nuck: Good thing my servers are Linux ;)
[03:09] polotek: if you have an fd you have to have the data around, either on the fs or in memory right?
[03:09] polotek: (reaching the limits of my experience at this level)
[03:09] Nuck: I'm pretty sure as long as it keeps an fd, it remains in existence, just unnamed.
[03:09] polotek: the way it works in PHP is you get the tmp filename, verify the upload however you do that
[03:09] Nuck: Or wait
[03:10] Nuck: Do I just unlink?
[03:10] polotek: and then move_upload_file or whatever the function name is
[03:10] polotek: which copies the file to a location of your choosing
[03:10] jameson has joined the channel
[03:10] polotek: Nuck, try that
[03:10] Aria: Just unlink.
[03:10] polotek: gotta go. later gents
[03:11] Aria: Though I'd just open the place I want it and write it as it comes in.
[03:11] Aria: No temp file at all.
[03:11] Nuck: Aria: I'm no good with Linux, can somebody explain the concept of linking and unlinking to me?
[03:11] polotek: Aria: verifying uploads is sometimes important
[03:11] tjholowaychuk: Nuck unlinking is like a reference
[03:11] polotek: hard to do when streaming
[03:11] Nuck: Aria: Well, it's uploaded first via AJAX, then I set it into place later.
[03:11] tjholowaychuk: you just say
[03:11] tjholowaychuk: im done with that shit
[03:11] tjholowaychuk: if all procs are done with it, then it's removed
[03:11] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: If I unlink but keep an fd, it stays, though?
[03:11] Nuck: This is ideal for a temp file.
[03:12] Nuck: Do I jsut call unlink on the file I write to?
[03:12] tjholowaychuk: yeah pass it a path
[03:12] Nexxy: omg teej language
[03:12] Nuck: As it is, I have an uploader that basically just dumps the raw file data into an HTTP body
[03:12] Aria: Nuck: any reason for this?
[03:12] shanebo: is it normal for node to make your head hurt?
[03:12] Nuck: And I just pipe into file
[03:12] Nuck: Aria: For what?
[03:13] Nuck: shanebo: That is a side effect of starting with Node, it goes away with continued use.
[03:13] Aria: Nuck: For using a temp file.
[03:13] shanebo: Nuck, man I sure hope so because I'm almost ready to bail :D
[03:13] Aria: shanebo: Yeah, async will break your head for a while.
[03:13] shanebo: what I don't get is how it's been compared to front-end js?
[03:13] Nuck: shanebo: It's actually quite pleasant once it digs its way into your psyche.
[03:14] Nuck: shanebo: Honestly, I don't see the semblance either, other than how it's the same language.
[03:14] shanebo: yeah, maybe that's why I've been confused
[03:14] Aria: shanebo: It's evented, that's the only similarity, other than the javascript.
[03:14] Nuck: shanebo: It's highly efficient and great for making powerful servers, though.
[03:15] brainproxy: event-driven, callbacks
[03:15] luke` has joined the channel
[03:15] Aria: Just as you have addEventListener('click'), you have on('data') in node.
[03:15] Nuck: Aria: I pipe to a temp file, display it on the page so they know what they just uploaded, then ask them for a title and whatnot.  If they never give a title and finish uploading, it needs to disappear.
[03:15] shanebo: no where in front-end js will you ever see a console.log, which is after a method with a console.log, fire before hand.
[03:15] Aria: ACTION nods. How long's the timeout?
[03:15] brainproxy: shanebo: I use console.log all the time in the front-end
[03:15] Nuck: shanebo: That happens.
[03:15] brainproxy: lol

[03:16] shanebo: haha, that's exactly what I did locally here

[03:17] shanebo: hahahah
[03:17] shanebo: i'm not alone
[03:17] Nuck: shanebo: Yeah, it's a bit odd, but you learn to read teh indentation as ordering isntead of the lines.
[03:17] shanebo: not sure I can get used to that
[03:17] Nuck: It just takes a bit of a mental change.
[03:18] brownies has joined the channel
[03:18] Nuck: Aria: I'm thinking I don't wanna do a timeout.
[03:18] jasonh has joined the channel
[03:18] Aria: Hm. Then when will this 'disappearance' take place?
[03:18] Aria: I mean, you really don't want to tie GC timing to user experience.
[03:18] Nuck: Aria: Hmmm... Valid point...
[03:18] Nuck: The big question for me is "how do I keep this shit around between pageloads"
[03:18] shanebo: Nuck, and the strange thing is that it only seems to do that with methods with callbacks
[03:19] Nuck: Can't shove an fd into a database, but I'm sure I can use an object.
[03:19] Aria: What I'd do is write it to a temp file mysef, "incoming/id", then when the title comes in, move it. And when it comes in the first place, setTimeout(removethefile, 3600)
[03:19] Aria: Nuck: That's easy. Node's persistent. All the page loads can share variables.
[03:19] tar_ has joined the channel
[03:20] Aria: If you use a global (or common between your two pages, anyway) variable, the data will be there.
[03:20] brownies has joined the channel
[03:20] Aria: IT's not like PHP where there's a free(everything) at the end of each request.
[03:20] Aria: Local variables die with their function or closure, but more global things last.
[03:20] Nuck: shanebo: Yeah, here's how it works: callbacks are executed when the command that is trying to be run is done.  It returns instantly, but the callback will be run when the event happens.
[03:21] Nuck: Code continues, but that callback will run when the event hits.
[03:21] Nuck: Until then, shit goes on.
[03:21] Nuck: Aria: I'd love to use a session store, but mine is on my db layer :/
[03:21] shanebo: does it help to trip on acid because I still don't get it ;)
[03:22] Aria: Nuck: Why? If it's in node, it's all there...
[03:22] Nuck: shanebo: lol did you ever deal with setTimeout in the browser, or perhaps events?
[03:22] fairwinds has joined the channel
[03:22] shanebo: very familiar with events
[03:22] shanebo: and delegation
[03:22] Nuck: Aria: I don't have globals per-user or per-session, only global for my server.  So I need to tie the uploads to a given session.
[03:22] Nuck: SeE?
[03:22] shanebo: but again, code still waits for something else to process before it fires the next line :D
[03:23] Aria: Right . . . So you have to do the ID yourself. But you can do that.
[03:23] Nuck: shanebo: Think of each callback function as an event listener.  It will wait until the event fires before actually running, but anything after that callback will still continue as usual.
[03:23] Nuck: It's no different from the events on the client-side
[03:23] webben has joined the channel
[03:24] shanebo: okay that helps
[03:24] shanebo: can i show you some concept code and you can tell me how stupid this is?
[03:25] Nuck: Using fs.readFile(function(){}) is just binding that "readFile" event and calling function when it's done.
[03:25] Nuck: shanebo: Sure :)
[03:25] shanebo: fs.readFile is what I'm getting hung up on
[03:25] Nuck: Aria: I'll just use an object with session IDs and whatnot :P
[03:26] Nuck: shanebo: If you want something to run after that, you don't shove it after it, you shove it in it.
[03:26] shanebo: boo!
[03:26] shanebo: :D
[03:26] Nuck: That's the thing that confuses a lot of people.  Stepping is done through callbacks.
[03:26] shanebo: it feels dirty
[03:26] Nuck: shanebo: It feels natural once you learn it better.
[03:27] shanebo: that means I've gotta litter and pass req and res in almost every method i run though right?
[03:27] brainproxy: yes, but you don't have to use anonymous functions
[03:27] Nuck: shanebo: Not quite
[03:27] shanebo: brainproxy, I rarely do
[03:28] Nuck: shanebo: Once you define a variable (whether as an argument or via `var req`), it is in that scope and all scopes within that.
[03:28] Nuck: So once you have a callback within a callback, the arguments of the outer one will be accessible from the inner one
[03:28] shanebo: even if it's not an anon func?
[03:28] Nuck: Node.js is a lot like inception.
[03:28] Nuck: shanebo: As long as it is defined within there
[03:28] shanebo: hahahaha
[03:28] Nuck: That's lexical scope
[03:28] brainproxy: just be careful w/ the closures :)
[03:29] Nuck: brainproxy: Pssssssssh! Fuck that noise, I use closures all willy-nilly.
[03:29] shanebo: brainproxy, care to elaborate?
[03:29] Hurreman: I've felt that all those hours writing jQuery-plugins (where nested callbacks are quite common) helped me get into node a bit faster. But just a week in so far, so still learning, but the initial headaches are gone :)

[03:30] Hurreman: hehe

[03:49] tjholowaychuk: so
[03:50] tbranyen: I've been thinking about client side from standpoint of startup, running, teardown events for all dynamic components

[03:50] tbranyen: looking it up, cause that sounds kind of sketch
[03:51] tjholowaychuk: it's definitely weird

[03:52] dexter_e: Anyone know how weld.js can be used to inject the attributes of html nodes?
[03:52] dexter_e: for example  <img src="myimage">     How does weld.js target the src ? 
[03:53] hij1nx has joined the channel
[03:53] dexter_e: Wow perfect timing
[03:54] dexter_e: Mr. hij1nx:  Can weld.js be used to inject html attributes like src and href?
[03:54] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: ah yeah i see what you're doing there.  my goal is to have every page backed by the server to eliminate render flicker on load and then from there everything is done client side
[03:54] SirRonKcuhc has joined the channel
[03:54] tbranyen: i hate going to sites that load dynamic content client side on initial load
[03:54] tbranyen: you get that ridiculously annoying flicker

[03:55] Nuck: `v commands
[03:55] SirRonKcuhc: Nuck: Commands: Type `v <command>.  Optionally, type `v <command> @ <nick> to send to a specific user. 				`v Commands are: about, beers, commands, git, google, help, macro. Other commands: v8, `re, `pcre, `ref.  Type `v help <command> for more information.  Join #v8bot for more support.
[03:55] Nuck: ACTION yells "hooray!"
[03:55] tjholowaychuk: tbranyen yeah i think the initial layout should be SS
[03:55] tjholowaychuk: pretty much always
[03:56] tjholowaychuk: but as far as smaller templates go, if you truly have an "app"
[03:56] tjholowaychuk: i think templates are kinda useless
[03:56] Nuck: SirRonKcuhc++
[03:56] SirRonKcuhc:  Nuck has given a beer to SirRonKcuhc. SirRonKcuhc now has 1 beers.
[03:56] catb0t: SirRonKcuhc now has 1 beer
[03:56] tbranyen: well you gotta use something
[03:56] Nuck: lel
[03:56] amerine has joined the channel
[03:56] tjholowaychuk: you do, but you want something dynamic
[03:56] Nuck: catb0t: Picky little shit.
[03:56] tjholowaychuk: you dont want to re-render a template to change a title
[03:56] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: something like uki?
[03:56] tjholowaychuk: when you can just do .title(str)
[03:57] linyows has joined the channel
[03:57] tjholowaychuk: people just need to stop thinking of views as somrthing you pass an object to
[03:57] tjholowaychuk: but something that is integrated
[03:57] tjholowaychuk: dynamic and "alive"
[03:57] shurane: Does everybody use anonymous functions in Javascript? Everything I see with jsdom seems to liberally use it.
[03:57] tjholowaychuk: shurane all the time
[03:58] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: hmmm that kind of shakes the foundation of data binding, no?
[03:58] tbranyen: well maybe not
[03:58] tbranyen: so long as data and presentation are 1:1
[03:58] shurane: Is it *that* common?
[03:59] tbranyen: shurane: about as common as naming your javascript files with the extension .js
[03:59] dexter_e: Can weld.js inject html attributes?  :)
[04:00] ekryski has joined the channel
[04:00] Nuck: I have an idea for an extension to v8bot.
[04:02] Nuck: The idea would be to hook it into NPM, so you can `install mongodb-native or something, then provide filtered access to require()
[04:02] Nuck: You'd be able to `install environment extension, then v8@environment: code

[04:06] dexter_e: Anyone know how to use weld.js ?  
[04:07] tjholowaychuk: doesn't sound like it
[04:07] dexter_e: Yeah, pardon the redundance
[04:07] dexter_e: I've just been trying to get this one question and google can't seem to caugh it up
[04:08] skm has joined the channel
[04:08] dexter_e: tjholowaychuck: Do you know which templating engine will render even if data is missing?
[04:08] tbranyen: mine will :D
[04:08] tjholowaychuk: weld and caustic need to combine
[04:08] tbranyen: but mine is also currently buggy as shit
[04:08] tjholowaychuk: i like that you can shove an object at weld
[04:08] tjholowaychuk: but you would still have to wrap an api around it
[04:08] dexter_e: Yeah I think thats where its at
[04:09] dexter_e: Basically like rubys merge or reverse_merge method
[04:09] dexter_e: but for views
[04:09] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: I think you should put MiddleWare into caustic.
[04:09] dexter_e:       MyTemplate.reverse_merge(   myObject  )   
[04:09] tjholowaychuk: Nuck yeah some plugins would be nice
[04:09] Nuck: Because I'd like to be able to add my own methods to modify data which would then be changed before DOM-ifying.
[04:09] tjholowaychuk: instead of the visitor
[04:09] Nuck: Like, with birthdays, etc.
[04:10] tayy has joined the channel
[04:10] dexter_e: Which template engine won't crash upon missing data ?
[04:10] Nuck: dexter_e: None of the ones in Express?
[04:10] tjholowaychuk: mustache
[04:10] Nuck: They just fire off to express.error I'd imagine
[04:10] tjholowaychuk: he means undefined vars i guess
[04:10] Nuck: Hey Anonymous, grab my 'stache!
[04:10] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: do i need to do anything special for partials support in express for my template engine?
[04:11] tjholowaychuk: tbranyen shouldn't have to
[04:11] dexter_e: can mustache be used for  on the fly defaulting too ?  Like      var a = s || "default"  ?
[04:11] tbranyen: excellent
[04:11] tjholowaychuk: as long as it supports local vars
[04:11] tjholowaychuk: and native js function execution
[04:11] tbranyen: yup
[04:11] tbranyen: but it doesn't support conditionals in loops
[04:11] tbranyen: learned that yesterday
[04:12] dexter_e: I see.  Yeah I was surprised that EJS didn't support that either.
[04:12] tbranyen: well in my case its a bug
[04:12] dexter_e: That made me wonder why its even called Embedded Javascript  
[04:12] tbranyen: :-p
[04:12] tjholowaychuk: ejs does
[04:12] tjholowaychuk: ..
[04:12] tjholowaychuk: lol
[04:12] tjholowaychuk: it IS just js
[04:12] tjholowaychuk: so yeah you can nest whatever you want
[04:12] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: shame there are two ejs's
[04:12] tjholowaychuk: ah
[04:12] tjholowaychuk: true
[04:12] tbranyen: i always get confused and think of javascriptmvc's
[04:12] tjholowaychuk: im writing mustache for c
[04:13] tbranyen: o rly
[04:13] dexter_e: actually though  if you reference anything undefined in an EJS template it will halt
[04:13] tbranyen: too bad mustache sucks donkey dicks
[04:13] tjholowaychuk: sorry it's not mustache
[04:13] tjholowaychuk: mustache-like
[04:13] tbranyen: oh
[04:13] tjholowaychuk: dexter_e yeah
[04:13] tbranyen: yeah i derive a lot from mustache
[04:13] tjholowaychuk: js will do that to you
[04:13] tjholowaychuk: but that's js, not ejs
[04:13] dexter_e: well JS will keep going

[04:16] Nuck: I prefer dogs
[04:16] tjholowaychuk: i want a sugar glider

[04:16] AAA_awright: Hey my dog is furry you insensitive clod
[04:16] Nuck: sugar glider?
[04:16] tbranyen: my cat don't like my ... smoke
[04:17] Nuck: AAA_awright: Mine is fuzzy :P
[04:17] dexter_e:  JS:    var a = nonExistantValue || "default-string";    =>a:'default-string'        EJS:   var a = nonExistantValue || "default-string"  =>  'nonExistantValue is undefined' wont run. 
[04:17] AAA_awright: That's a subset of furry?
[04:17] Nuck: AAA_awright: No, fuzzy doesn't yiff.
[04:17] tbranyen: dexter_e: nonExistentValue needs to be defined
[04:17] tbranyen: like scoped
[04:17] AAA_awright: ahem.
[04:18] tbranyen: v8> var a = nonExistentValue || "default-string";

[04:20] tjholowaychuk: same with jade
[04:21] Nuck: Jade is just ugly.
[04:21] tbranyen: pfft yeah right, i bet you wrote a parser for something almost identical to JS, but you halt on undefineds just to fuck with us
[04:21] Nuck: It's powerful
[04:21] Nuck: But ugly.

[04:21] tjholowaychuk: i wrote a markdown to docbook compiler

[04:21] glen1 has left the channel
[04:21] tjholowaychuk: because i fucking hate xml
[04:21] tbranyen: markdown++
[04:21] SirRonKcuhc:  tbranyen has given a beer to markdown. markdown now has 1 beers.
[04:22] Nuck: dexter_e: EJS is LITERALLY just JS.
[04:22] Nuck: catb0t is picky with the ++'s as always.

[04:23] dexter_e: var data={ garbage:"non-related"};     var html = new EJS({url: 'cleaning.ejs'}).render(data);        Is there a way to make templates still render in this situation?
[04:24] tjholowaychuk: oh you're using the lame CS ejs
[04:24] tjholowaychuk: no clue
[04:25] tjholowaychuk: I imagine it's similar
[04:25] dexter_e: whats cs ejs ?
[04:25] Nuck: client-side EJS?
[04:25] dexter_e: oh 
[04:25] dexter_e: yeah 
[04:25] dexter_e: I didn't know it was lame I thought there was only one ejs  wow
[04:25] Nuck: Nope
[04:25] tjholowaychuk: it's just a really gross implementation
[04:25] Nuck: You can render on the server too
[04:25] cjm has joined the channel
[04:25] tjholowaychuk: like the mustache js implementation haha it's huge for something so basic
[04:25] Nuck: I use it via tjholowaychuk's awesome Express.
[04:26] dexter_e: I'm using ejs  in node too 
[04:26] Nuck: dexter_e: Got NPM?
[04:26] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: i was surprised at how slow it is
[04:26] dherman has joined the channel
[04:26] tbranyen: not that it matters much for the size of my templates
[04:26] tjholowaychuk: which?
[04:26] tbranyen: mustache.js
[04:26] tjholowaychuk: ejs?
[04:26] dexter_e: Nuck: Yes got npm
[04:26] tjholowaychuk: oh
[04:26] tjholowaychuk: yeah mustache should be really optimized
[04:26] Nuck: npm install ejs
[04:26] tjholowaychuk: more so than ejs etc
[04:26] Nuck: amirite?
[04:26] tjholowaychuk: yup
[04:27] dexter_e: yeah I installed ejs 
[04:27] dexter_e: with npm install ejs
[04:27] Nuck: npm is very straightforward.
[04:28] dexter_e: but I am also using EJS to render  in-browser map reduce functions with underscore 
[04:28] hij1nx has joined the channel
[04:29] dexter_e: so all UI-events just request data from the local model and the model does update-merging between clicks behind the scenes.

[04:31] Nexxy has joined the channel
[04:31] caolanm has joined the channel
[04:33] dexter_e: I think once solutions like  Weld.js and Caustic are on the horizon its hard to still use {{}}<%%>type stuff.
[04:33] _jgr has joined the channel
[04:33] tbranyen: dexter_e: i dunno i think {{ }} will always be my first choice
[04:33] tbranyen: since its so obvious whats going on
[04:34] tjholowaychuk: the only inflexibility due to something like weld or caustic is the granular stuff
[04:34] tjholowaychuk: other than that they are wildly more helpful
[04:34] dexter_e: granular stuff like what?
[04:34] dexter_e: like conditionals and stuff ?
[04:34] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: unless you are a client side developer who hates the DOM with a passion of the christ
[04:34] tjholowaychuk: like if you want to set a title, and have the title represent say "User {name}" but you get an auto-generated .title(str)
[04:35] dexter_e: right right
[04:35] tjholowaychuk: you have to tell it some how that you want a {pre,post}fix
[04:35] hij1nx_ has joined the channel
[04:35] tjholowaychuk: though wth caustic you could easily hint at that
[04:35] tjholowaychuk: <h1 class="title">User {val}</h1> etc could still be used
[04:35] tjholowaychuk: tbranyen haha well we kinda have to use it
[04:36] tjholowaychuk: i just dont want to write my view abstraction layer
[04:36] tjholowaychuk: by hand all the time
[04:36] tjholowaychuk: i dont do client-stuff often
[04:36] tjholowaychuk: but that seemed obvious to me
[04:37] tbranyen: i dunno just seems like your data and your view should be completely separate, that much seemed obvious to me
[04:37] kawaz_home has joined the channel
[04:37] tbranyen: why should i be coding all this presentation layer stuff
[04:37] tjholowaychuk: they aren't separate
[04:37] tjholowaychuk: decoupling css/html/js
[04:37] tjholowaychuk: is BS
[04:37] tjholowaychuk: IMO
[04:37] tbranyen: no wai
[04:37] tjholowaychuk: they are extremely coupled
[04:37] Nexxy: that's what she said
[04:37] dexter_e: its true
[04:37] jerrysv: css/html = presentation
[04:38] tbranyen: yes
[04:38] tbranyen: i agree with that
[04:38] Nuck: CSS and HTML are one and the same, IMO.
[04:38] jerrysv: javascript = more dynamic
[04:38] Nuck: JS is a bit more separate
[04:38] jerrysv: though css3 transitions have approached javascript
[04:38] tbranyen: jerrysv: yeah and not many people are happy about that
[04:38] tbranyen: well i'm speaking for myself
[04:38] Nuck: jerrysv: I disagree. transitions are something for presentation, not for action.
[04:38] tjholowaychuk: plus with something like caustic, it's still separate, but WHEN/WHERE you update portions of a view
[04:39] tjholowaychuk: are stil the same as rendering some template really
[04:39] tjholowaychuk: Nuck: yeah I agree too
[04:39] brainproxy: there's this interesting CS field called bi-directional programming, which is closely tied to the "view update" problem and involves neat concepts like "lenses" and "get put" laws
[04:39] tjholowaychuk: css should have more
[04:39] Nuck: JS = action, CSS/HTML = presentation
[04:39] tbranyen: seems thats the same as jQuery("header").text("some header");
[04:39] tbranyen: which is ugly
[04:39] jerrysv: nuck: but that line can blur some, depending on the transition
[04:39] tbranyen: and shitty to work with someone else who codes like that
[04:39] Nuck: CSS3 transitions are just presentation in their core
[04:39] brainproxy: I think it would interesting to try to bring some of that research into templating and shared-state stuff
[04:39] Nuck: jerrysv: Not that much.
[04:39] AAA_awright: JS=logic, CSS=presentation, XML/RDF=data
[04:39] Nuck: Some people try to use it as such
[04:39] tjholowaychuk: tbranyen vs view.render({ header: 'val'}) ?
[04:40] tjholowaychuk: same thing really
[04:40] tjholowaychuk: one is more flexible
[04:40] Nuck: But it is still not JS
[04:40] tjholowaychuk: one is less flexible
[04:40] dexter_e: I think things will move in the direction which Flash has actually been going. 
[04:40] Nuck: AAA_awright: I agree, but substitute HTML5 for XML
[04:40] jerrysv: regardless, break the logic out from the presentation
[04:40] dexter_e: Blackboxes of functionality
[04:40] AAA_awright: Which is a subset of XML
[04:40] AAA_awright: Really, I mean DOM
[04:40] cha0s has joined the channel
[04:40] cha0s has joined the channel
[04:40] AAA_awright: Formatting doesn't really matter
[04:40] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: except that in the first example header is a DOM element that could theoretically change to <div id="header"> which then breaks the code generation the presentation
[04:41] jerrysv: sorry to jump in (i should have ignored the irc window)
[04:41] tjholowaychuk: in most interactive web apps the presentation is highly coupled to any actions
[04:41] tbranyen: while in the second, it's a freely movable property
[04:41] dexter_e:   Sealed components which just accept an object and we don't need to know how they work inside. 
[04:41] tjholowaychuk: tbranyen: sure, that's why you use an abstraction
[04:41] tbranyen: since its just data and the presentation encapsulates it
[04:41] Nuck: jerrysv: I use CSS3 for progressive ehancement.
[04:41] shanebo: Nuck, re: CSS transitions, it is a play on js because there are things like :hover where you can "fire" a transition. So it's a blurring in my opinion...
[04:41] tbranyen: yea yea yea, too old with client side to hear these new fangled ideas
[04:41] Nuck: AAA_awright: It's a subset of dom and a brother to XML
[04:41] dexter_e: tjholowaychuk: Have you ever played around with Flash MovieClips by any chance ?
[04:42] tjholowaychuk: nope
[04:42] tjholowaychuk: not in like 5 years
[04:42] Nuck: XML and HTML are only similar in looking, very different in parsing.
[04:42] jerrysv: nuck: i suppose if you're using javascript to change parameters that are modified in the presentation by the transition it moves it back to the presentation layer ...
[04:42] tbranyen: unfortunately
[04:42] Nexxy: how is a transition anything *but* presentation?
[04:42] hij1nx: dexter_e: hey
[04:42] Nuck: Nexxy: Very good question.
[04:43] dexter_e: hij1nx: hey
[04:43] AAA_awright: Different in parsing how?
[04:43] dexter_e: The man himself. 
[04:43] dexter_e: I'm raging to use your weld.js module. 
[04:43] jerrysv: hij1nx: you all fixed?
[04:43] hij1nx: dexter_e: you can use weld to do this
[04:43] Nexxy: woah tmi
[04:43] hij1nx: jerrysv: yep! =)
[04:43] dexter_e: How to inject src and hrefs etc. ?
[04:43] Nuck: AAA_awright: HTML is designed to not die with glitches, whereas XML is explicitly built to bitch at you about everything.
[04:43] jerrysv: hij1nx: awesome. xcode reinstall, custom build, or just moving to a vm?
[04:43] dexter_e: possible. 
[04:44] hij1nx: dexter_e: i'll private message you so that we don't flood the noderoom
[04:44] hij1nx: m
[04:44] dexter_e: hij1nx: Thanks!
[04:44] AAA_awright: Nuck: I'm presuming that invalid XML is an oxymoron, since it's not XML
[04:44] Nuck: AAA_awright: Invalid XML means somebody tried to do XML but fucked up ;)
[04:44] AAA_awright: Right
[04:45] Nuck: Invalid HTML is the same
[04:45] jerrysv: hij1nx: and any more thoughts re: ab?
[04:45] Nuck: But Invalid HTML just gets kicked to tag soup
[04:45] Nuck: And it's very lax
[04:45] Nuck: IT's the difference between the JSLint subset of JS and normal JS

[04:50] AvianFlu: the usual joke is "there are no girls who can code", I'm surprised
[04:50] chjj: well thats not true, you just dont see them often
[04:50] Nuck: chjj: The rule of the internet is "tits or GTFO"
[04:50] jerrysv: hij1nx: how many people were there last night? how many were male? how many do javascript?
[04:50] chjj: on the interwebs
[04:51] dgathright has joined the channel
[04:51] Nuck: Therefore, as there are no tits in here, there are no girls
[04:51] chjj: maybe we should solve this problem, by making the node logo more attractive to women
[04:51] chjj: discuss
[04:51] tjholowaychuk: im pretty sure the person who invented the compiler was a lady
[04:51] Nuck: I've got a better idea
[04:51] tjholowaychuk: can't remember

[04:51] chjj: grace hopper
[04:51] Nuck: Let's make a commercial for Node
[04:51] Nuck: In the style of a commercial for women's hygeine products
[04:52] Nuck: So women dancing around, looking happy
[04:52] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: that military chick?
[04:52] tjholowaychuk: tbranyen something like that
[04:52] tbranyen: that i learned about in college
[04:52] Nexxy: Nuck, I quite resent that
[04:52] chjj: there were also 3 really famous women programmers who did all this early punch card programming
[04:52] jerrysv: ACTION remembers about 15% women at jsconf, and 10% women at nodeconf
[04:52] Nexxy: not that my gender is of *any* significance
[04:52] fwg: she invented ADA
[04:52] Nexxy: but yeah.
[04:52] chjj: because node is manly and masculine
[04:52] Chani: 15%? wow
[04:53] Nuck: Nexxy: Why would you, there's a 99.9999999999% chance you're a man.
[04:53] Nuck: Duh.
[04:53] jerrysv: chani: yeah, i tried to count. my SO was one of the 15%
[04:53] Nexxy: Nuck, dismissed :)
[04:53] brainproxy: the javascript meetup in St. Louis on Thursday was a bronado :[
[04:53] Nuck: Nexxy: lol
[04:53] brainproxy: 30 guys I think no women in sight
[04:53] Nexxy: stop having your meetups in bars 
[04:54] Nuck: brainproxy: Did you have a Louise Boat?
[04:54] brainproxy: it wasn't
[04:54] Nexxy: and you might have better success with inclusion and diversity
[04:54] brainproxy: it was in a corporate office
[04:54] Nuck: Nexxy: But they hafta get drunk somehow.
[04:54] Nexxy: and then get really awkward?
[04:54] Nexxy: yaa
[04:54] Nuck: But I'm naught but 17, so I don't have room to talk about getting drunk ;)
[04:54] Nuck: Since I couldn't get in a bar anyways
[04:54] Nexxy: oh that explains it
[04:55] Chani: ACTION once tried to start a LUG that met in bars. :) but we were too lazy to actually meet
[04:55] jerrysv: nexxy: jsadmirers on wednesday - not even in a bar. and i can guarantee at least one woman there
[04:55] tbranyen: Chani: need to find an open bar
[04:55] Chani: I generally don't go to local meetups, though, either they're too old and stuffy, or too macho :/
[04:55] chjj: pfft, 17 year olds, always complaining about the frontend
[04:55] tbranyen: ?twss
[04:56] tbranyen: crap no thats what she said bot
[04:56] Nuck: chjj: Pssssh! I've been coding for a decade, I know how to program D:
[04:56] Nuck: tbranyen: I assume that's not on v8bot, right?
[04:56] chjj: didnt say you didnt, i say youngsters are always complainin
[04:56] tjholowaychuk: you've been programming since you were 7?
[04:56] Nuck: ACTION will happily configure SirRonKcuhc to be awesoemr.
[04:56] tbranyen: legos man
[04:56] chjj: ROFL
[04:56] Chani: of course, if the annoying overly-macho guys scare off the nice people, then, it's a self-perpetuating problem.
[04:57] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: Learned BASIC at 7
[04:57] Nuck: Yes
[04:57] tjholowaychuk: ballin
[04:57] chjj: tbranyen: lol, cant stop laughing
[04:57] Nuck: I still have the CD of the computer game that taught me vanilla basic.
[04:57] tbranyen: chjj: woot :D
[04:57] tjholowaychuk: i didnt really start until 21
[04:57] Nuck: Learn to Program Basic from Interplay.
[04:57] Chani: theoreticaly I should start a meetup froup and insist that people not be jerks. but, that sounds like work
[04:57] Chani: and I'm being dragged off to bed :)
[04:57] tbranyen: yeah i didn't start coding till 15 and it was vb.net
[04:57] Nuck: (who, I might add, also made Fallout 1 & 2)
[04:57] tbranyen: fawk
[04:57] tjholowaychuk: Nuck old fallout was sweet
[04:57] tjholowaychuk: new fallout sucks
[04:58] Nuck: I learned BASIC at 7, dabbled in Perl at 11, PHP at 12, and learned the basics of SQL then too
[04:58] Nuck: Dabbled in JS for a while
[04:58] Nuck: Got into Mootools
[04:58] Nuck: Then I stopped for a few years
[04:58] mscdex: qb64!
[04:58] tbranyen: i tried playing old fallout, could not get into it
[04:58] tbranyen: new fallout is too good
[04:58] tbranyen: >_<
[04:58] tjholowaychuk: no way!
[04:58] tjholowaychuk: bethesda does NOT know how to animate anything
[04:58] tjholowaychuk: ever
[04:58] AvianFlu: new fallout is post-nuclear oblivion
[04:58] tjholowaychuk: i have no clue what's wrong with the people they hire
[04:58] AvianFlu: old fallout was just a different game
[04:58] jerrysv: and on that note, i feel really old, so good night
[04:58] mscdex: psh fancy games ain't got nothin' on zzt
[04:58] jesusabdullah: Fallouts 3 and New Vegas were great
[04:59] chjj: i hate feeling old and im only 22 =/
[04:59] jesusabdullah: I say this as a fan of the older fallout games
[04:59] Nuck: When I was 15, I got dragged into coding a wordpress site for a manga scanlation group, and got back into PHP and JS then.
[04:59] tjholowaychuk: grim fandango is where it's at
[04:59] tbranyen: chjj: i kind of want to skip my next birthday
[04:59] tbranyen: fucking being 24
[04:59] jesusabdullah: I bet Grim Fandango is a good game
[04:59] mscdex: ACTION goes to play some ut3
[04:59] chjj: i know!
[04:59] jesusabdullah: tbranyen: Why for? I'm 24 you know
[04:59] tbranyen: jesusabdullah: because aging is retarded
[04:59] Nuck: And I stopped for a few months, got onto deviantART chat, and picked up PHP and JS and became pretty fluent in both
[05:00] Nuck: But personally, I think FAllout 3 and New Vegas needed better programmers
[05:00] tbranyen: i think i'm heading towards total epic meltdown
[05:00] Nuck: I mean, shit.  SUDDENLY, DEATHCLAW
[05:00] tjholowaychuk: mostly animators
[05:00] Nuck: Worst.  Glitch.  Ever.
[05:00] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: No, both had horrible glitches
[05:00] tjholowaychuk: i've only dabbled with animation and i could do better
[05:01] jesusabdullah: Oh, yeah, New Vegas was put out by a third party that is notorious for buggy scripting
[05:01] Nuck: The fact that if an enemy spawns just slightly out-of-place, it will fall into blue hell and cycle to the sky
[05:01] tbranyen: animate this *pulls down pants*
[05:01] Nuck: And fall to the ground
[05:01] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Well, Fallout 3 was worse
[05:01] tbranyen: weird i played fallout 3 all the way through and it was fine for me
[05:01] tbranyen: borderlands was buggy as shit
[05:01] Nuck: NPCs consistently disappeared and went to 0,0 in the current square
[05:01] tbranyen: then again i applied a shit ton of patches
[05:01] Nuck: I had to save my brother's ass with the console multiple times :P

[05:04] Nuck: AAA_awright: Are you looking to log?
[05:04] Nuck: If so, Mongo is pretty damn good for logging.
[05:04] AAA_awright: A single point
[05:05] Nuck: But I imagine Redis would work too

[05:31] Nuck: IUNO
[05:31] sammmy: God doesn't exist
[05:31] sammmy: :o
[05:32] sammmy: anyway. You got a function that stops somewhere in the middle and the continues in the stack below it, and then at some point in the future returns back into the funciton...makes no fucking sense.
[05:33] tar_: sammmy: it lets you wait on an event with sequential-style code
[05:33] tbranyen: to the untrained mind
[05:34] Nuck: sammmy... My head hurts now more than it did when I first learned Node.
[05:34] sammmy: tar_: fuck sequential-style, this is what callbacks are for.
[05:34] raidfive has joined the channel
[05:34] tbranyen: sammmy: what you just described sounds like a callback
[05:34] sammmy: Nuck: thankfully, afaik, Node doesn't have coroutines
[05:34] tbranyen: function() { ... callback(function() { ... }); ... }
[05:35] tar_: without that third ...
[05:35] systemfault: sammmy: Lookup for "yield" for mozilla's implementation of javascript
[05:35] tar_: unless I'm misreading your intention
[05:35] tbranyen: tar_: i'm just reading what sammy wrote
[05:35] tbranyen: thats how i interpreted it
[05:36] sammmy: tbranyen: no. What I described is insanity. What you thought I described was: You have a function that returns to the stack below it (like normal), and then that stack continues until it hits another function in which it jumps into, and eventually that will return back to the outer stack (like normal).
[05:36] tbranyen: no its not
[05:36] sammmy: I guess when I say stack "below" I mean the outer function scope (I'm assuming that a stack is a bottom-up kind of thing)
[05:37] Spion_ has joined the channel
[05:37] tbranyen: that middle function may or may-not be synchronous
[05:37] tbranyen: you can very well skip right over it and not get a return value
[05:38] sammmy: wait what. All functions that I'm aware of stop execution and are synchronous, unless I'm confused.
[05:38] tbranyen: you are very confused
[05:38] sammmy: tbranyen: then give me an example.
[05:39] tbranyen: function read() { var data = ''; console.log(data); fs.readFile('/some/file', function(err,data) { data=data.toString(); }); console.log(data); }
[05:39] tbranyen: logs '' and then '' again
[05:39] sammmy: hang on. I have to drain the main vain.
[05:40] tbranyen: same

[05:43] sammmy: tbranyen: are you talking about the anonymous function is passed over? If so, then that's because it's not called.
[05:45] sammmy: sure the anonymous function is asynchronous, because it's not being called until .readFile decides to call it. My point is that all functions calls are synchronous in JS, if they weren't JS would be a very confusing language.
[05:46] bartt has joined the channel
[05:46] Nuck: sammmy: You're very wrong.
[05:46] Nuck: sammmy: Node.js has asynchronous shit
[05:46] Nexxy: sammmy, embrace the callback
[05:46] sammmy: You guys are missing my point
[05:46] tar_: he likes callbacks; he doesn't like coroutines
[05:46] sammmy: I'm talking about _function calls_
[05:46] systemfault: sammmy: I think you missed it.
[05:47] sammmy: not _functions_
[05:47] systemfault: sammmy: I told you to lookup for the "yield" keyword...
[05:47] systemfault: It will show you how it works.
[05:47] sammmy: somefunction(); someotherfunction();... someotherfunction waits until somefunction returns, am I wrong?
[05:48] systemfault: No, it's not that.
[05:48] Nuck: sammmy: Maybe, maybe not.
[05:48] systemfault: sammmy: Check that https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators
[05:48] Nuck: sammmy: If somefunction is asynchronous, it might still be running after it returns.
[05:48] sammmy: Nuck: O.o
[05:48] Nuck: So someotherfunction and somefunction will be doing work in parallel.
[05:49] Nexxy: lol
[05:49] sammmy: Hmm. How could two functions be working in parallel if JavaScript is supposed to be single threaded. Or, does two things happening at once not necessarily mean two threads?
[05:50] Nuck: sammmy: Welcome to the asynchronous world of Node.js
[05:50] tshpaper has joined the channel
[05:50] Nuck: shanebo: Dejavu much?
[05:50] Nexxy: how exactly does a function continue working after it returns?
[05:50] kaww has joined the channel
[05:50] Nuck: Nexxy: Events.
[05:50] sammmy: Nexxy: exactly, it's madness.
[05:50] shanebo: Nuck, actually I thought node is async but the code is not
[05:51] Nexxy: Nuck, explain?
[05:51] sammmy: Nuck: a stored callback being executed is not the returning function "continuing".
[05:51] Nexxy: lol
[05:51] tar_: this is a weird conversation.
[05:51] Nuck: shanebo: Code is not, but I/O is.  I/O will often be nested into your code.
[05:51] shanebo: meaning the functions are still sequential but one doesn't wait until one is complete
[05:51] Nexxy: "Events." is not an answer
[05:51] sammmy: tar_: Ikr.
[05:52] Nuck: sammmy: An I/O function in Node can return immediately, but take no callback
[05:52] Nuck: It might just be a lack of any reason to wait
[05:52] McMAGIC--Copy has joined the channel
[05:52] sammmy: An anonymous function is what allows JS the ability of asynchronousity, no?
[05:52] Nuck: But it still might be executed in parallel.
[05:53] sammmy: s/An anonymous function/Anonymous functions
[05:53] shanebo: Nuck I really don't think it executes in parallel. I think if there's a callback the code doesn't wait for the callback
[05:53] Nuck: sammmy: Doesn't have to be anonymous,any function will work.  But it's mostly the fact that Node.js interfaces with the system's async I/O libraries and whatnot
[05:53] systemfault: Nothing executes in parallel with JS.
[05:53] Nuck: systemfault: I/O does
[05:53] systemfault: Nuck: That's at a lower level..
[05:54] systemfault: But JS itself works with a message queue.
[05:54] Nuck: Aye, but it can make it so line order doesn't match execution order
[05:54] sammmy: Nuck: I stand corrected on that, it doesn't have to be anonymous functions. What I really meant to say was functions being data-types in JS is what allows for async.
[05:54] Nuck: Node.js is a confusing beast.
[05:55] shanebo: Nuck, right but only when there's callbacks
[05:55] Nuck: sammmy: JS itself has no async, but Node does.
[05:55] tar_: sammmy: not even that, but that's what allows it to be conveniently async
[05:55] Nuck: shanebo: If I do fs.writeFile, it still works.
[05:55] chjj: sammy: you can have callbacks in languages with out functions as first class
[05:55] chjj: see also: C
[05:55] Nuck: It'll write for as long as it needs to
[05:55] Nuck: But I don't need to check if it's error'd, so I don't do a callback.
[05:55] Nuck: (I SHOULD, but I won't)
[05:56] sammmy: The libraries and native implementations on top of JS is what is async, not JS itself.
[05:56] chjj: ...you said anonymous functions
[05:57] Nuck: sammmy: It's confusing as fuck, but things can happen as simultaneously as in any language.
[05:57] sammmy: Take setTimeout for example. It accepts a function as one of it's arguments. That function holds the code that will execute at a later time, but when it does no other JS will be running in parallel.
[05:57] Prometheus: confusing as fuck =P
[05:57] Nexxy: why don't you guys just go look it up instead of all this supposition? ;P
[05:57] tar_: There is a single system thread, but many user-space threads, and many outstanding I/O requests.
[05:57] chjj: sammy: "anonymous functions" are not what enables this capability
[05:57] sammmy: Note, that the function setTimeout takes isn't executed right away, this is how it can achieve async.
[05:57] Nuck: Any language can't overcome the fact that the system doesn't do two things at once
[05:58] systemfault: What?
[05:58] Nuck: We only get the illusion of things happening at the same time
[05:58] sammmy: chjj: I corrected my self, read on.
[05:58] Prometheus: Nuck: do you ever sleep?
[05:58] systemfault: Two CPUs can do something at the same time.
[05:58] Nuck: We are limited by the number of processors.
[05:58] chjj: Nuck: i guess youve never worked with multiple cores
[05:58] sammmy: Nuck: agreed. thank you.
[05:58] Nuck: Well yeah
[05:58] chjj: multiple contexts *can* execute at the same time
[05:58] chjj: but you need more than one cpu
[05:58] Nexxy: Prometheus, I was going to ask him a similar question, only s/sleep/think before you talk/
[05:59] Nuck: lol Nexxy
[05:59] Prometheus: Nexxy: heh, that has passed my mind before
[05:59] Nuck: Prometheus: And I do sleep, from about 4:30AM Pacific to 2PM :P
[05:59] tar_: fail fast, fail often!
[06:00] Nuck: tar_: Failure is not an option :P

[06:00] Nuck: Prometheus: Debating switching to powernaps
[06:00] Prometheus: Nexxy: I believe the technical term is opinionated
[06:00] Nuck: Yeah, that about sums me up.
[06:00] Prometheus: Nuck: powernaps kill your brain

[06:02] tar_: preferably on my second core
[06:02] Nuck: And then I can sleep in like 4-hours a night
[06:02] Prometheus: Nuck: I hear insomnia helps
[06:02] Prometheus: with that
[06:02] Nuck: lol
[06:02] Nuck: I'm just a nightowl
[06:03] Nuck: And my family is on a normal schedule
[06:03] chjj: i used to nap, now i just dont sleep, works better
[06:03] sammmy: I power napped all day today. Donno what's wrong with me. :\
[06:03] Nuck: So I'd like to have a way to stay on my own schedule without fucking up my family's sechdules.
[06:04] chjj: leave your family
[06:04] chjj: !
[06:04] Nuck: Plus if I'm gonna be a CEO
[06:04] tar_: you just need to learn to communicate with your family asynchronously.
[06:04] Nuck: I'm gonna need to be there when everyone else is
[06:04] Nuck: tar_: I've tried :P
[06:05] tar_: you just need to learn to try asynchronously.
[06:05] sammmy: anyway. maybe I'm crazy, but I like callbacks more than synchronous coroutine stuff. :\
[06:05] jesusabdullah: Me too, maan
[06:05] jesusabdullah: Me too
[06:05] Nuck: callbacks are awesome
[06:05] sammmy: haha
[06:06] systemfault: sammmy: WTF.
[06:06] systemfault: sammmy: You like Apples more than Motorcycles?
[06:06] tar_: when I want a custom thread scheduler, coroutines make it pretty easy.
[06:06] fangel has joined the channel
[06:06] hij1nx: systemfault: ??
[06:06] sammmy: however, anonymous functions in JS are why, I think, most people get nousious with callbacks. :\
[06:06] hij1nx: systemfault: apples to motorcycles? hehe
[06:06] systemfault: hij1nx: He's comparing coroutines to callbacks.
[06:06] Nexxy: Prometheus, opinionated indicates that you know what you're talking about ;P
[06:06] sammmy: systemfault: well, yes actually. But that's irrelevant.
[06:07] hij1nx: systemfault: i'm not sure that's analogous
[06:08] systemfault: hij1nx: They can't be compared.
[06:09] dexter_e_ has joined the channel
[06:10] AAA_awright: And, wtf is this about http://nodejs.org/cla.html Can we drop the legal nonsense from Node.js please?
[06:10] tar_: at least, not at the level sammmy was describing them. But you can easily compare { ...; wait_for(asyncOp); ...; } and { ...; asyncOp(function() { ... }); }
[06:10] sammmy: maybe I don't know what a coroutine is, and my head is all fucked up with the concept. But, what I was reading online, that it's a certain kind of function that can yield execution, returning to the outer scope for execution, then at some point continue executing.
[06:10] systemfault: AAA_awright: Pretty much any big company has a damn CLA :/
[06:10] systemfault: hmm
[06:10] systemfault: s/big//
[06:11] chjj: AAA_awright: its just what happens when the suits get involved
[06:11] Nexxy: AAA_awright, I don't see where the "nonsense" comes in
[06:11] chjj: i dont think its a problem
[06:11] Prometheus: Nexxy: not necessarily =)
[06:11] AAA_awright: Nexxy: It's FUD, therefore, nonsense
[06:11] Xeon06_ has joined the channel
[06:11] systemfault: sammmy: Yes, very useful for generators
[06:11] Nexxy: AAA_awright, I thought FUD meant "fear, uncertainty, and doubt"
[06:11] AAA_awright: Yep.
[06:11] Nexxy: all I see is a contract that specifically states who owns what
[06:12] hij1nx: AAA_awright: if you don't have that agreement, it will be difficult for joyent to function in a leadership role or as a benefactor of the project
[06:12] Nuck: AAA_awright: That CLA protects Node.js from getting their asses in trouble.
[06:12] AAA_awright: I'm sorry, this is software, since when is that owned?
[06:12] Nexxy: lol
[06:12] systemfault: AAA_awright: Welcome in the real world.
[06:12] systemfault: AAA_awright: I'm from planet earth, where are you from?
[06:12] Nuck: AAA_awright: Please tell me that was sarcastic?
[06:12] AAA_awright: hij1nx: Newsflash, I have Node.js forked on Github, and so do a lot of people
[06:13] hij1nx: AAA_awright: its MIT
[06:13] hij1nx: AAA_awright: that's what we want
[06:13] Nuck: AAA_awright: Forking is fint
[06:13] Nuck: It's just the pull requests that need that agreement.
[06:13] hij1nx: AAA_awright: javascript party =)
[06:13] Nuck: So they don't get in trouble :)
[06:14] AAA_awright: So then why do the approved developers want a CLA to merge changes into their blessed repository?
[06:14] Nuck: AAA_awright: Nobody wants Joyent to get in trouble for anything that somebody might've stolen.

[06:17] chjj: midi music, amazing
[06:17] Nuck: shanebo: It's well-done, but it looks like shit.
[06:17] chjj: and the sparkle that follows the mouse cursor
[06:17] Nuck: But the work on it is nice
[06:17] hij1nx: shanebo: no one agrees on this subject.
[06:18] tar_: is there any way we could put the current page on geocities in the late 90s.
[06:18] systemfault: Ahhh wait, don't forget the lake java applet on the logo 
[06:18] chjj: hahaha
[06:18] sammmy: systemfault: required for generators. But why use a generator when you could just seperate your code between the yields into callbacks or something like that?
[06:18] igl: shanebo: technically well made
[06:18] shanebo: I reckon the folks who hate it, hate anything that doesn't have a cloud in it with lens flares, drop shadows, gradients, and rainbows
[06:19] systemfault: sammmy: Check examples on the net, it's a lot more elegant.
[06:19] Nuck: -lens flares -rainbows
[06:19] Nuck: gradients, drop shadows, clouds
[06:19] Nuck: Especially the first two.
[06:19] Nuck: ACTION <3s gradients and drop shadows
[06:19] systemfault: And... seriously... the worst problem... NOT ENOUGH UNICORNS
[06:19] chjj: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Logos
[06:19] Nuck: systemfault: NEEDS MORE CORNIFY
[06:19] chjj: the logos in the middle are nice imo
[06:19] chjj: plus the turtle logo
[06:20] hij1nx: sammmy: i like callbacks. less sugar and gets the job done.
[06:20] Nuck: I like SubStac k's drawing :P
[06:20] AAA_awright: Nuck: That doesn't even make any sense, that's exactly why Git has Author name, email, and date, separate from committer name, email, and date, and that's what --signoff is for
[06:20] chrisdickinson: shanebo: its well executed, but it just doesn't have the right character.
[06:20] tar_: ...; async(function() { ...; async(function() { ...; async(function() { ...; async(function() { ...; }) }) }) });
[06:20] chjj: yeah, his other one isnt on there, its much funnier imo

[06:20] systemfault: Clean and professional.
[06:20] Nuck: AAA_awright: Well, it's like the ToS for authors who want their code committed.
[06:20] sammmy: systemfault: I see the usefulness now. Good concept actually.
[06:21] chjj: systemfault: i completely agree
[06:21] Nuck: I'm gonna be putting the old logo on my Node-powered site
[06:21] chjj: systemfault: thats the one i like, i wish that were the logo
[06:21] Nuck: I think a design competition for Node would be better
[06:21] Nuck: I would happily enter.
[06:21] chjj: but nothing beats the turtle
[06:21] shanebo: that last one has potential too
[06:21] chjj: is v8 strapped to the turtle or the turtle strapped to v8?

[06:45] chjj: sounds better than this place
[06:45] mscdex: california has silicon valley, i mean come on
[06:45] seivan: Does anyone know what module you required in order to write coffeescript and not having to compile?
[06:45] Nuck: Oregon.  No sales tax, public transit gets you anywhere, it's always beautiful outside (rainy, sure, but trees everywhere), and people pump gas for you.
[06:46] mscdex: silicon valley is actually doing better in this recession than everywhere else
[06:46] chjj: seivan: its better to accept the fact that youre compiling to a high level language
[06:46] Nuck: California.  Average to high sales tax, public transit won't do shit for you, it's always too fucking hot, and people are just assholes to you.
[06:46] Nuck: mscdex: Portland, OR is barely hit.
[06:46] Nexxy: Nuck, you don't even drive
[06:46] shanebo: California may be the greatest state, but Texas is the greatest country.

[06:46] chjj: yeah, nuck is like 10 or something

[06:46] mscdex: Texa$
[06:46] Nuck: chjj: lolno
[06:47] seivan: No one remembers?
[06:47] seivan: There was this module you could require in order to write coffeescript without having to watch/compile
[06:47] Nexxy: seivan, supervisor?
[06:47] mscdex: eh?
[06:47] Nuck: But the only reason I can't drive is because my brother is bipolar and would throw a hissy-fit if I got my license before him.
[06:47] mscdex: coffeescript is compiled to js at some point....
[06:47] materialdesigner: seivan: 
[06:48] seivan: "hissy-fit"
[06:48] seivan: :D
[06:48] materialdesigner: just use coffee --watch
[06:48] mscdex: whether you do it manually or implicitly
[06:48] Nuck: I could probably learn to drive within a month.
[06:48] seivan: materialdesigner: fair enough
[06:48] chjj: what the hell, so you cater to his bipolarity?
[06:48] seivan: But I still like the name

[06:48] materialdesigner: you may also be able to write a Cakefile?

[06:51] Nuck: chjj: Once I have a company, I want to move to the bay area and whatnot.
[06:51] mscdex: you can get your license at 17 in california or oregon or wherever the heck you are?
[06:51] Nuck: I'll probably be out of this house by the time he moves out
[06:51] Nuck: mscdex: Oh yeah, easily
[06:52] Nuck: But I hafta wait for my older brother to get it first
[06:52] Nuck: So he doesn't try to kill himself.
[06:52] mscdex: i figured most states were 18 nowadays except montana
[06:52] Nuck: (manic depressive = bipolar)
[06:52] Nuck: mscdex: I think we moved to that for anyone born after 1995
[06:52] Nuck: So it's phasing in soon
[06:53] chjj: 18? pretty sure its still 16 here
[06:54] Nuck: My brother is taking forever to get a goddamn license.  Why?  Because he's "too busy"
[06:54] systemfault: I'm 28... no license.

[06:57] Nuck: chjj: If I paid him to do it, he would.

[07:01] mscdex: Nuck: it's just not the same
[07:01] seivan: How would one use coffeekup in express?
[07:01] chjj: it really is not the same
[07:01] Nexxy: mscdex, still waiting for mine
[07:01] chjj: mscdex is right
[07:01] seivan:   app.set('view engine', 'coffeekup'); doesn't seem to do it
[07:01] alexhq has joined the channel
[07:01] Nexxy: svtronics has 12 in stock finally
[07:01] Nexxy: I'm tempted to buy them all
[07:01] Nuck: Is v8bot registered?
[07:01] mscdex: Nexxy: still waiting? you ordered already? from who?
[07:01] Nuck: If not, I'm more than happy to host it.
[07:01] Nexxy: mscdex, no, they were out of stock forever
[07:01] Nexxy: just checked today and there are 12
[07:02] chjj: do it, but you gotta get the particular commit the old one was
[07:02] seivan: app.register '.coffee', require('coffeekup')
[07:02] seivan: app.set 'view engine', 'coffee'
[07:02] jesusabdullah: What is this Nexxy ?
[07:02] Nexxy: jesusabdullah, the most amazing thing ever!
[07:02] Nexxy: http://svtronics.com/panda_board
[07:02] Nuck: chjj: Waht changed btween then and now?
[07:02] chjj: and it has to be named v8bot or some variation thereof
[07:02] Nuck: `v commands
[07:02] SirRonKcuhc: Nuck: Commands: Type `v <command>.  Optionally, type `v <command> @ <nick> to send to a specific user. 				`v Commands are: about, beers, commands, git, google, help, macro.

[07:02] mscdex: Nexxy: oh, when i bought mine i actually sent an email to svtronics first, asking if they had any in stock
[07:02] chjj: i have no idea
[07:02] mscdex: Nexxy: they said they did, so i promptly ordered
[07:02] chjj: im just saying, i want it to be the same whatever it is
[07:02] Nuck: chjj: v8butt or v8boot?
[07:02] mscdex: Nexxy: got it within a matter of days
[07:02] Nexxy: mscdex, does it come with the AC Adapter
[07:02] jesusabdullah: Oh! That looks pretty boss
[07:02] Nexxy: or do I really have to buy it separately?
[07:03] chjj: something that sounds like it *wasnt* named by a 17 year old
[07:03] jesusabdullah: Reminds me of the beagleboard
[07:03] Nuck: lol
[07:03] chjj: :)
[07:03] jesusabdullah: Hell, might be beagleboard 2.0 for all I know
[07:03] Nexxy: jesusabdullah, ya it is beagleboard++
[07:03] jesusabdullah: ah!
[07:03] Nexxy: chjj++
[07:03] SirRonKcuhc:  Nexxy has given a beer to chjj. chjj now has 2 beers.
[07:03] catb0t: chjj now has 3 beers
[07:03] jesusabdullah: Then it IS awesome!
[07:03] mscdex: Nexxy: no, separate. but iirc you can power the board over usb otg if you have the cable
[07:03] jesusabdullah: I want one.
[07:03] mscdex: just like the beagleboard
[07:03] Nexxy: well
[07:03] Nexxy: it's going to power a kiosk
[07:03] Nexxy: sooo
[07:03] Nexxy: AC adapter it is
[07:03] mscdex: heh
[07:03] Nuck: chjj: Make me a name and I'll happily figure shit out ;)
[07:03] Nuck: I already host 3 bots on deviantART chat
[07:03] Nuck: On  home server
[07:03] Nuck: So it's always running
[07:04] mscdex: Nexxy: i think i ordered my ac adapter from digikey
[07:04] chjj: how about v8b, v8_, v8`, v8bot`, etc
[07:04] anaio has joined the channel
[07:04] Nexxy: mscdex, do you know the inner/outer diameter and voltage on the adapter?
[07:04] Nuck: v9bot
[07:04] Nuck: lol
[07:04] jesusabdullah: Nexxy: What kinda kiosk is this all for?
[07:04] jesusabdullah: :o
[07:04] Nexxy: lol
[07:04] chjj: v8_bot
[07:04] Nexxy: uhm

[07:05] Nexxy: but I'ma be releasing the kiosk platform
[07:05] mscdex: Nexxy: i'd have to go measure the barrel
[07:05] Nexxy: after I'm satisfied with it
[07:05] Nuck: chjj: v8bot_
[07:05] chjj: sure why not
[07:05] Nuck: It's not registered, just checked.
[07:05] xeodox has joined the channel
[07:05] Nuck: chjj: What's the difference on the commit?
[07:06] Nexxy: mscdex, digikey's adapters are big and expensive!
[07:06] chjj: i have no idea, im just saying whatever it was, it should be the same
[07:06] chjj: when was last commit?
[07:06] Nexxy: mscdex, https://specialcomp.com/pandaboard/order.htm
[07:06] Nuck: There any way to register a nick without switching nicks?
[07:07] systemfault: Nuck: What do you mean?
[07:07] Nuck: systemfault: Meh, nevermind, I'll leave it unregistered
[07:07] systemfault: Hmm, if that's what I think... you can link more than a single nick to an account.
[07:07] systemfault: So you can switch between the nicks
[07:07] Nuck: ACTION pulls up screen on his home server
[07:07] systemfault: irssi+screen+ssh ftw
[07:07] Nuck: systemfault: Nah, I was thinking of registering my bot but w/e
[07:08] chjj: doesnt matter, not like anyones gonna take it
[07:08] Nexxy: just /ns group after you identify to the original nick
[07:09] Nuck: starting up now
[07:09] Nuck: Man this thing is slow to start up
[07:09] v8bot_ has joined the channel
[07:09] Nuck: And there we go.
[07:09] Nuck: Happier?
[07:10] mscdex: Nexxy: the barrel is about 0.5cm in diameter and 2mm inside
[07:10] Nuck: Hope you guys like it :D
[07:10] chjj: v8: ''
[07:10] v8bot_: chjj: ""
[07:10] Nexxy: mscdex, d'awww... thanks for checking for me <3
[07:10] chjj: good
[07:10] mscdex: Nexxy: yeah, specialcomp's site was out of stock for the ac adapter at the time i bought my board
[07:10] Nexxy: ohh oki
[07:10] Nexxy: and obv. I will need some SDHC card
[07:10] Nexxy: for storage
[07:10] Nexxy: ya?
[07:10] Nuck: chjj: I just did git clone and pulled the master lol
[07:10] mscdex: Nexxy: pretty much
[07:11] mscdex: i'm not sure if there's a way to built-in way to boot to usb or not
[07:11] chjj: when was the last commit?
[07:11] visudo has joined the channel
[07:11] chjj: oh, last november? ha
[07:11] Nuck: chjj: lol
[07:11] chjj: k, good
[07:11] Nuck: v8bot hasn't been on in over a week
[07:11] chjj: i think were good then
[07:12] chjj: as long as its the same version
[07:12] Nuck: lol
[07:12] Nuck: If I can't help with Node's code, at least I can provide a vanilla v8bot copy :P
[07:12] SamuraiJack has joined the channel
[07:12] alexhq: Where I can find any benchmark for net module?
[07:13] Nuck: Might eventually rewrite it though
[07:13] Nexxy: Nuck, don't forget alienating other developers!
[07:13] Nuck: Because it's fucking slow.
[07:13] Nexxy: you're great at that too
[07:13] Nuck: Nexxy: SHUT UP ABOUT RUBY!
[07:13] Nuck: lol :P
[07:13] jesusabdullah: Nexxy: Word
[07:13] zer0-: Anybody use Jasmine here?
[07:13] AvianFlu: dont' worry, nuck, ruby's nowhere near as bad as you are :-P
[07:14] Nexxy: zer0-, I do quite a lot
[07:14] chjj: when did ruby come up?
[07:14] Nexxy: usually in tea
[07:14] Nuck: AvianFlu: Because I'm a bad mother fucker.
[07:14] seivan: hmm
[07:14] seivan: I am divided.... jade or coffeekup,   js or coffeescript
[07:14] seivan: >_>
[07:14] Nexxy: ACTION covers eyes
[07:14] chjj: ...js
[07:14] Nuck: seivan: JS.
[07:14] Prometheus: clojurescript!
[07:14] Prometheus: =P
[07:14] zer0-: Nexxy: stick with coding.. 
[07:14] Nuck: COFFEECLOSUREJS :D
[07:15] mscdex: seivan: js and ejs! ;-)
[07:15] Nuck: NINE!
[07:15] chjj: i dont see how that can even be a decision, coffeescript used to not bug me, now i hate it
[07:15] Nuck: (needed a version number)
[07:15] Nuck: chjj: Not good if something gets worse the more you deal with it D:
[07:15] chjj: my hatred progressively grew worse and worse
[07:15] seivan: Coffeescript has it's place.
[07:15] seivan: It 's quite good.
[07:15] chjj: what is its place?
[07:15] seivan: As nor being a pain to maintain and write and read
[07:16] chjj: js is a pain to write?
[07:16] Nuck: seivan: JS does the same
[07:16] chjj: nevermind, use coffeescript, sounds like you need it
[07:16] Nuck: That is, IF YOU LEARN IT.
[07:16] Nuck: LEARN JS.
[07:16] Nuck: HINT HINT.
[07:16] chjj: this ^
[07:16] seivan: right
[07:17] rileys has joined the channel
[07:17] Nuck: While I dig the idea of a layer over JS to fix the shortcomings, I disagree with changing syntax
[07:17] Nuck: I think a better setup is more like LESS --> CSS
[07:17] materialdesigner: ejs produces some of the ugliest code ever
[07:17] AvianFlu: noobs produce ugly code
[07:18] systemfault: Anyway... the way I see it, if something can fuck up JS, it's ES.next
[07:18] Nuck: Where it's the same thing as before, just with extensions.
[07:18] digman543 has joined the channel
[07:18] AvianFlu: I have yet to see a language that's always ugly
[07:18] Nuck: ES?
[07:18] systemfault: PHP
[07:18] Nuck: Perl.
[07:18] systemfault: PHP is always ugly.
[07:18] Prometheus: ^
[07:18] chjj: systemfault: yeah, agreed, i dont see why they need to even change js
[07:18] Nuck: PERL is always ugly.
[07:18] chjj: why do they feel the need to add all this overambitious shit
[07:18] mscdex: cobol is always igly
[07:18] mscdex: ugly too
[07:18] AvianFlu: no, I know a couple of really smart people who write non-shitty php code
[07:18] Nuck: I have yet to hear anyone argue that Perl isn't ugly
[07:18] AvianFlu: and perl is just voodoo that you don't know, nuck 
[07:18] Nuck: And SOME PHP can be okay.
[07:18] AvianFlu: perl is awesome
[07:18] chjj: AvianFlu: thats true, it is possible to write good code in it
[07:18] Nuck: AvianFlu: I've tried to learn Perl.
[07:19] chjj: but few do
[07:19] Nuck: But the syntax is hideous
[07:19] systemfault: chjj: I sincerely hope that ES.next with just join his brother ES4 in the garbage.
[07:19] chjj: yes
[07:19] chjj: please yes
[07:19] chjj: =(
[07:19] chjj: or
[07:19] AvianFlu: what, no C++ nuck?
[07:19] chjj: v8 will just choose not to implement it
[07:19] chjj: and all implementations boycott it
[07:19] jshaw has joined the channel
[07:19] chjj: that would be amazing
[07:19] Nuck: systemfault: ES.next?
[07:19] systemfault: Nuck: "Harmony"
[07:19] Nuck: Oh right
[07:19] Nuck: Agreed
[07:19] Nuck: Harmony sounds like total shit
[07:20] AvianFlu: perl is a really cool syntax style, it's just not as common as dots
[07:20] systemfault: JS corrupted by Javatards.
[07:20] systemfault: That's what Harmony is about.
[07:20] chjj: and if it forces v8 to implement something that slows it down, i will be ...angry
[07:20] jesusabdullah: What's harmony?
[07:20] zeade1 has joined the channel
[07:20] zer0-: isn't Ecma5 == Harmony?
[07:20] Nuck: ES5 is the best thing ever
[07:20] chjj: no
[07:20] chjj: es5 is not harmony
[07:20] Nuck: Harmony is basically ES6
[07:20] systemfault: ES5 doesn't bring that much.
[07:20] Nuck: In progress
[07:20] zer0-: aah
[07:20] random123: The only thing that could possible be uncomfortable about EJS for you is the begin and end tags to signify you are entering JavaScript... so... OCD?
[07:20] Nuck: systemfault: Naught but improvements, though.
[07:21] jesusabdullah: That's the one that's thinking about arrows right?
[07:21] chjj: technically harmony is a revision of es4, if you realized there was no es4
[07:21] systemfault: Nuck: Right.
[07:21] Nuck: It basically taks shit from our JS libs and makes it native
[07:21] chjj: because they skipped it, because they temporarily acknowledged it was shit
[07:21] jesusabdullah: oh wait, no, that's es.next or whatevs
[07:21] zer0-: there's some good shit about ES5 like added security with freezes and such
[07:21] chjj: im okay with es5
[07:21] chjj: its fine
[07:21] Nuck: ES4 existed, but it got quickly buried when they realized it was shit
[07:21] systemfault: zer0-: When was the last time you used .freeze?
[07:21] Nuck: What the fuck is a freeze?
[07:21] chjj: nuck: i just said that
[07:21] systemfault: I only like ES5 for the function additions and the strict mode.
[07:21] mscdex: .freeze et al actually slows v8 down
[07:21] mscdex: :\
[07:22] pastak_ has joined the channel
[07:22] mscdex: well, maybe not all of v8, but for accessing that object and such
[07:22] systemfault: v8: var lol = {}; Object.freeze(lol); lol.rofl = 10;
[07:22] v8bot_: systemfault: TypeError: Can't add property rofl, object is not extensible
[07:22] zer0-: systemfault: well freeze was just an example.. but things like being able to secure objects with def() is just awesome
[07:22] Nuck: I like how browsers have started to pick out "the good stuff" to implement first
[07:23] chjj: what they should have done, was standardize __proto__
[07:23] chjj: theyre stupid for not doing that
[07:23] systemfault: Nobody needs __proto__
[07:23] chjj: ridiculously stupid
[07:23] systemfault: Seriously...
[07:23] chjj: __proto__ is amazing
[07:23] systemfault: chjj: Why^
[07:23] chjj: ...
[07:23] systemfault: Heh.
[07:23] chjj: one-line inheritence for one
[07:23] systemfault: Object.create?
[07:23] chjj: thats one line?
[07:23] systemfault: That's not 10 :/
[07:24] chjj: its at least 3 unless you want to stick it on one line
[07:24] chjj: and make it look horrible
[07:24] versicolor has joined the channel
[07:24] chjj: also, defining inheritence after the instantiation of an object, thats amazingly powerful
[07:24] Nuck: All of the ES5 implemented in Mozilla so far has been good
[07:24] chjj: something that should *definitely* be in a language with prototypes
[07:24] chjj: in fact, thats the hallmark of js isnt it? dynamic objects, why shouldnt we be able to do that?
[07:25] rileys: you can already do that just by setting the prototype of the object
[07:25] chjj: we can change things after the fact
[07:25] chjj: thats the point of js oo
[07:25] chjj: rileys, no you cant
[07:26] chjj: you cannot change a single objects prototype after its created
[07:26] systemfault: I'm still wondering why Array.prototype.indexOf sucks so much because it can't take a function as argument.
[07:26] chjj: interesting, i didnt know that
[07:27] systemfault: I wonder why they didn't think we might be interested in finding other things than basic types..
[07:27] versicolor has joined the channel
[07:27] mikeal has joined the channel
[07:28] chjj: well they didnt, because you can pass an object
[07:28] chjj: functions are merely "callable objects" as defined by ecma
[07:28] chjj: i wonder why functions are excluded there =/
[07:28] vns has joined the channel
[07:29] systemfault: Hmm
[07:29] mscdex: .. var f = function() {}, a = [f]; a.indexOf(f);
[07:29] catb0t: 130
[07:29] mscdex: :S
[07:30] chjj: or, systemfault was wrong, hehe
[07:30] rileys: its not really all that common to need to change the prototype once an instance of the object has been created though
[07:30] chjj: is that your fallback argument?
[07:30] systemfault: mscdex: it compares the reference.
[07:30] chjj: i dont care if its common, i care if its useful
[07:30] mscdex: systemfault: of course, just like a plain object
[07:31] Aiden has joined the channel
[07:31] mscdex: systemfault: that's the way it is in all of js
[07:31] chjj: and it is more common than you think, once you realize how you can use it
[07:31] systemfault: mscdex: You misunderstood me I think.
[07:31] systemfault: What I wanted it:
[07:31] necrodearia has joined the channel
[07:32] zeade has joined the channel
[07:32] systemfault: x = [{lastName: "ninja"}, {lastName: "rofl"}]; x.indexOf(function(o) { return o.lastName = "rofl"; });
[07:32] systemfault: That would of course.. return 1
[07:32] Ramosa has joined the channel
[07:32] systemfault: Err
[07:32] mscdex: that's not how indexOf works though
[07:32] systemfault: == "rofl";
[07:32] systemfault: That's how it should work imho.
[07:33] systemfault: That's why I think that indexOf sucks.
[07:33] mscdex: well, it wouldn't know whether it's a callback or a function to look for
[07:33] systemfault: Then it should always take a function.
[07:33] systemfault: *callback
[07:33] madsleejensen has joined the channel
[07:33] mscdex: no way
[07:33] chjj: systemfault: its not a filter function
[07:33] mscdex: there's other functions to do what you want
[07:33] systemfault: chjj: I didn't want to filter it..
[07:34] systemfault: chjj: I wanted the index.
[07:34] chjj: i know, but im saying
[07:34] chjj: thats not how it works
[07:34] systemfault: Then it's not generic enough.
[07:34] chjj: it doesnt work that way, and it definitely shouldnt, otherwise you could never get the index of a function
[07:34] madsleejensen has joined the channel
[07:35] devaholic has joined the channel
[07:36] Nuck: systemfault: Genericizing isn't always good
[07:36] mscdex: you could easily do that with Array.reduce()
[07:36] saurabhverma has joined the channel
[07:36] mscdex: or just use a for-loop
[07:37] mscdex: or write your own function heh
[07:37] systemfault: shrug...
[07:37] mscdex: or monkey patch .indexof
[07:37] mscdex: :p
[07:37] delian66 has joined the channel
[07:37] Nuck: mscdex: It's not monkey-patching if it's part of the language's features ;)
[07:37] mscdex: huh?
[07:37] Nuck: Extending prototypes is normal, right?
[07:37] chjj: but its not
[07:38] chjj: i think he meant monkey patching indexOf so it takes a callback, that is not a feature
[07:38] mscdex: you're not extending it, you're changing it's behavior
[07:38] mscdex: yeah
[07:38] Nuck: mscdex: "oh sorry I accidentally your indexOf"
[07:39] Metapony_ has joined the channel
[07:39] chjj: huh?
[07:39] mscdex: eh?
[07:42] chjj: i really with there was a String.prototype.count in js, to count the appearances of a substring
[07:42] chjj: instead of doing the hacky split way
[07:42] systemfault: hmm
[07:42] chjj: 'abcabc'.count('a')
[07:42] uptownben has joined the channel
[07:42] uptownben: hey all
[07:42] mscdex: yo

[07:43] systemfault: v8: "lol lol lol lal".match(/lol/g).length;
[07:43] v8bot_: systemfault: 3
[07:43] chjj: yeah, but that will throw if theres no match at all
[07:43] systemfault: err. :/
[07:44] uptownben: I read somewhere that if I set up a node.js chat server , it would only be able to handle around 6500 connection, true?
[07:44] systemfault: v8: ("lol lol lol lal".match(/lol/g) || []).length;
[07:44] v8bot_: systemfault: 3
[07:44] systemfault: v8: ("lol lol lol lal".match(/lal/g) || []).length;

[07:44] systemfault: v8: ("lol lol lol lal".match(/lil/g) || []).length;
[07:44] v8bot_: systemfault: 0
[07:44] chjj: god thats ugly
[07:44] systemfault: Hack t3h planet!
[07:44] systemfault: :(
[07:44] jesusabdullah: Just x.map(function(o) { return o.lastname; }).indexOf("rofl")
[07:44] jesusabdullah: btw
[07:44] chjj: no thanks, split is much better at that point
[07:45] chjj: ''.split('lol').length - 1, and it doesnt throw
[07:45] systemfault: jesusabdullah: Sure... just slow :'(
[07:45] uptownben: I'm spec'ing out a project and was considering node.js , just need to get an idea of how scaleable it is..
[07:45] jesusabdullah: How so?
[07:45] chjj: jesusabdullah: i was going to say that until i realized how inefficient it was
[07:45] jesusabdullah: and how slower than any other filtering mechanism?
[07:46] mscdex: for-loop will always be fastest
[07:46] jesusabdullah: Also, I'm not huge on speed optimizations
[07:46] chjj: well first it has to map the array, and then iterate over a *new* array
[07:46] mscdex: ;-)
[07:46] jesusabdullah: Well okay, fair enough
[07:46] uptownben: thoughts?
[07:46] mscdex: uptownben: it's very scalable
[07:46] chjj: uptownben: where did you hear that, im curious
[07:47] uptownben: can you point me to some scaling docs?
[07:47] jesusabdullah: Oh, yeah, I doubt that's the case

[07:49] chjj: give chjj more webscale please
[07:49] mscdex: uptownben: a single node process can handle quite a lot of traffic
[07:49] Nexxy: and the only prescription
[07:49] chjj: ACTION gives nexxy more webscale
[07:49] Nexxy: is more web scale.
[07:49] jesusabdullah: Moar of them, cache-ing, moar fasters boxorz, a mongodb
[07:49] mscdex: uptownben: but you can spawn additional node processes and load balance between them if you want
[07:49] chjj: nexxy: i read your mind
[07:49] jesusabdullah: XD
[07:50] uptownben: oh ok, so I can losd balance between them?

[08:09] Nuck: chjj: Why base it on the time of rotation
[08:09] Nuck: We have electricity

[08:10] kkaefer: let's invent a new measurement of time to make writing software that deals with dates even more... fun!
[08:10] SubStack: somebody can write a metric calendar for node knockout
[08:11] systemfault: We already do no?

[08:12] jesusabdullah: they're the official SI unit after all
[08:12] chjj: you couldnt call it a day
[08:12] Nuck: jesusabdullah: You could've said the same thing about inches and feet and whatnot.
[08:12] Nuck: days can remain
[08:12] Nuck: But let's change hours, minutes, andseconds
[08:12] jesusabdullah: except that seconds have been in use, consistently, much much longer than that
[08:13] AvianFlu: I prefer to count my time in antiseconds
[08:13] Nuck: Who thought "24 subdivisions per rotation, and 60 to that, and then 60 in that"
[08:13] jesusabdullah: If you were to invent a new time-unit anyway, it would have to be pegged to something much more precise than the day
[08:13] Nuck: The day is accurate enough.
[08:13] jesusabdullah: Nuck: The babylonians, iirc. The idea is that 60 is divisible by a lot of things
[08:13] jesusabdullah: No, the day is nowhere near precise enough. It has a huge standard deviation.
[08:13] AvianFlu: the babylonians counted in base 60

[08:23] jesusabdullah: There are chats everywhere, but idk about encrypted

[08:23] jesusabdullah: hmm

[08:35] chjj: framlin_: theres not that much to learn once you get the concept of a middleware and route stack down
[08:35] jesusabdullah: You could incorporate encryption though right?
[08:35] jesusabdullah: https://github.com/substack/dnode/tree/master/examples/chat I found it, fwiw
[08:35] SubStack: dnode is really great at making your complicated single page app with lots of back and forth simpler
[08:36] chjj: framlin_: i recommend reading the code if you dont understand something, its the best tutorial
[08:36] SubStack: or for writing libraries like hookio or sodr
[08:36] darshanshankar: dnode is also good at the server-server stuff
[08:36] jesusabdullah: SubStack: sodr?
[08:36] framlin_: chjj: I feared its like drupal or struts or something like that
[08:36] SubStack: oh, sodn
[08:36] framlin_: i will have a lokk
[08:36] djcoin: But is dnode is secure to use clientside ? as you may use any callback etc. ?
[08:36] SubStack: isaacs's botnet toy
[08:37] djcoin: (I guess you just need to make a few checks))
[08:37] framlin_: chjj: so you recommend to fork it?
[08:37] jesusabdullah: djcoin: It doesn't work that way.
[08:37] framlin_: .. to read the code ...
[08:37] catb0t: SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
[08:37] jesusabdullah: It doesn't serialize functions, it wraps them
[08:38] chjj: framlin_: i just meant read it if you dont understand it
[08:38] chjj: https://github.com/visionmedia/express/tree/master/lib
[08:38] chjj: all the middleware stuff is in connect though
[08:39] jesusabdullah: djcoin: As such, it should be as secure as anything else, since you're still moving "just data" around---it's just a really frickin' slick abstraction
[08:39] Nuck: Gah, why can't somebody halp me on mongo D:
[08:39] djcoin: jesusabdullah: what does that change ? I still can open my firebug and use the dnode embed in my browser and feed him with a func that will be executed server side, no ?
[08:39] SubStack: djcoin: you are mistaken
[08:39] djcoin: Yeah, I wonder how its made inside, cause its quite awesome
[08:40] Nuck: djcoin: No
[08:40] Nuck: Basically, each side can call functions that the other side chooses to expose
[08:40] jesusabdullah: djcoin: No.
[08:40] Nuck: At least, that's my interpretation
[08:40] jesusabdullah: djcoin: It doesn't serialize functions.
[08:40] SubStack: functions execute on the side they are defined
[08:40] Nuck: Feel free to correct me
[08:40] jesusabdullah: djcoin: What it allows you to do, is use local functions as the callbacks of remotely-defined ones
[08:41] jesusabdullah: and, transparently, it wraps your callbacks in a, "send the result over dnode/json to this function"
[08:41] Nuck: But yeh, any mongo-smart folks?
[08:41] SubStack: it is hard to explain but it just works
[08:41] djcoin: SubStack: :)
[08:41] Nuck: SubStack: It Just works™

[08:42] djcoin: Thanks for making such awesome stuff (already told you once, but well :] )
[08:43] Nuck: Can somebody here explain to me why Mongo is hard to get help on?
[08:43] jesusabdullah: Because I don't use mongo.
[08:43] Nuck: you should
[08:43] jesusabdullah: I'm a support MACHINE
[08:43] Nuck: It's awesome
[08:43] SubStack: Nuck: because mongo is webscale?
[08:43] djcoin: Because folks using Mongo are too busy trying to get back their lost data :)
[08:43] jesusabdullah: but I never need databases
[08:43] SubStack: so naturally people are too busy sharding to help you out
[08:43] darshanshankar: hahahahaha
[08:43] Nuck: SubStack: lol
[08:43] SubStack: and deploying MASSIVE SCALING
[08:44] Nuck: SubStack: Then how come I get help for Node? ;)
[08:44] jesusabdullah: Also, I'm totally going to write an article called "Why you should use excel spreadsheets for your next database" and submit it to HN
[08:44] djcoin: :)
[08:44] SubStack: node isn't a real thing, it's just some wrappers to do disk and network i/o for v8
[08:44] Nuck: jesusabdullah: I fully support that notion :P
[08:44] Nuck: SubStack: Yes, and then make execution super-easy :P
[08:44] framlin_: chjj: I have just looke at http://www.screenr.com/mAL and if that video is any representative, that much to heavy for what I am looking for ... 
[08:44] jesusabdullah: Well geez, some of the stupid crap that only makes it because of shocking titles...
[08:44] Nuck: Node is thin but owerful and incredibly useful.
[08:45] jesusabdullah: I just saw an article that was titled, "why you should quit your job and become a PhD"
[08:45] framlin_: but hanks for yout hints anyway !!
[08:45] Nuck: jesusabdullah: lol they have it backwards
[08:45] framlin_: Thanks 
[08:45] jesusabdullah: Exactly. I say this as someone that went to grad school.
[08:45] Nuck: "why you should quit your PhD and become a worker"
[08:45] jesusabdullah: Unless you want to do research, which honestly can be pretty thankless, you probably shouldn't waste your time
[08:46] jesusabdullah: and even if you *Want* to do research, just get a masters and then do research in industry
[08:46] SubStack: jesusabdullah: not just that a phd in the HUMANITIES?
[08:46] jesusabdullah: OR, just get it out of your system

[10:51] seivan has joined the channel
[10:52] hybsch has left the channel
[10:52] Nuck: AAA_awright: joins aren't really something I've had to use with Mongo
[10:52] Nuck: I never saw a need either
[10:52] Nuck: I can put an object in an object
[10:52] AAA_awright: For document stores sure, which is probably 80% of my need
[10:52] Nuck: I can store damn near anything in document form
[10:53] Nuck: I can even make it act like a relation store.  You just use a specific set of fields consistently :P
[10:53] AAA_awright: Nuck: Well for instance, if I log _all_ the data coming off an online game, if I want to record players joining, each life, each shot, kill, movement, message, those are all different tables and relational joins are well suited for that
[10:53] Nuck: Why would those be separated?
[10:53] Nuck: You just put them as a field in teh document
[10:53] AAA_awright: because they all contain different data
[10:54] AAA_awright: But that's hard to work with
[10:54] Nuck: AAA_awright: Not really
[10:54] Nuck: You can query subsets of the data
[10:54] AAA_awright: With SQL it's a snap to formulate each player's strength rating
[10:54] adrianmg has left the channel
[10:54] Nuck: AAA_awright: Strength rating?
[10:54] AAA_awright: I'd have to come up with some MapReduce script to do that in MongoDB
[10:54] AAA_awright: Nuck: Like Elo
[10:54] Nuck: Query by username
[10:55] Nuck: What I would do is store that data as a subdocument in the user documents
[10:55] azend has joined the channel
[10:55] Nuck: Because that info is an aspect of the user
[10:55] AAA_awright: And it's also an aspect of the entire team
[10:55] Nuck: And then I'd use some of Mongo's more advanced features to keep it compiled in another document.
[10:56] AAA_awright: I want to query the order in which everyone made shots, you have to merge multiple documents to do that
[10:56] AAA_awright: With a table it's just another index
[10:56] Nuck: AAA_awright: Or just query a log list.  It's not hard to do these things :P
[10:56] Nuck: Merging documents?
[10:56] Nuck: Fancy-talk
[10:57] AAA_awright: MongoDB would do it probably, but still
[10:57] AAA_awright: It has to store all that in memory
[10:57] Nuck: wat
[10:57] Nuck: AAA_awright: It wat
[10:57] Nuck: AAA_awright: Mongo isn't a memory store
[10:57] Nuck: It's a database
[10:57] Nuck: No different from MySQL
[10:57] Nuck: Well
[10:57] Nuck: Actually
[10:57] Nuck: I take that bakc
[10:57] Nuck: It's faster
[10:57] Nuck: Than MySQL/
[10:57] AAA_awright: Let's say I have a table of all the shots that I made
[10:58] AAA_awright: There's potentially hundreds of thousands of them through the course of a day
[10:58] Nuck: AAA_awright: Sure?
[10:58] AAA_awright: And I want to generate a heatmap of where people are firing shots, and where they're most successful
[10:58] AAA_awright: How would I store all this in MongoDB? It's straightforward with tables
[10:59] Nuck: You know Mongo has extra capabilities for geospatial data?
[10:59] Nuck: Yeah
[10:59] Nuck: You can even query "within 5 units of this x,y"
[10:59] Nuck: IIRC
[10:59] Nuck: mongly.com taught me about geospatial shit
[11:00] Nuck: 'twas some badass tricks
[11:00] AAA_awright: I think that requires making each shot event its own document
[11:00] H4ns`` has joined the channel
[11:00] Nuck: AAA_awright: How do you do it in a table?
[11:00] Nuck: Don't you just do a row per-shot?
[11:01] AAA_awright: You have a table for it, playerid, spawnid, eventtime, initial vector, velocity vector, etc
[11:01] Nuck: AAA_awright: To put things simply, rows <> documents and tables <> collections
[11:01] Nuck: AAA_awright: But one per shot event?
[11:01] Nuck: Correct?
[11:01] AAA_awright: Yeah
[11:02] Nuck: AAA_awright: Documents are no different from rows.
[11:02] AAA_awright: Except they're hard to join
[11:02] Nuck: I don't see what you mean :V
[11:02] Nuck: Why join?
[11:02] Nuck: Well, I guess I can see problems there
[11:02] AAA_awright: If I want to get the username of each person who fired the shot
[11:03] blup has joined the channel
[11:03] AAA_awright: I can just join the players table to the shot.playerid
[11:03] AAA_awright: That's really costly in MongoDB since you're doing it application side
[11:03] Nuck: ah well, in Mongo, you just query for playerid (which is very simple) and grab the player by that id
[11:03] Nuck: It's not that hard.
[11:03] Nuck: And you store by ObjectId and it gets faster
[11:05] AAA_awright: My point is relational DBs already do it fast, they already do the caching
[11:05] AAA_awright: So for lots of joins I don't think you can beat it
[11:06] Nuck: fair enough
[11:06] Nuck: But for data like that, I'd use something like redis
[11:06] AAA_awright: But there's only really 2 applications that I've needed that sort of join power

[11:12] Nuck: I'm gonna compile those numbers in advance, though.
[11:12] AAA_awright: Speaking of which, how much do you wanna bet I can make a better one?
[11:12] Nuck: When an artwork gets a new tag, all faves, etc. will be updated to have that
[11:13] Nuck: AAA_awright: Better art site?
[11:13] AAA_awright: I mean, sugguestion algorithm

[11:14] AAA_awright: Nuck: I've done a lot of work with prediction, though it was all in MySQL
[11:14] Nuck: AAA_awright: I follow the rule of KISS
[11:15] Nuck: AAA_awright: Orly?  My main concept is to weight all the things a user "faves" or "likes" (two levels of appreciating), and then study the tags on those, then grab the results for those and sort them via a method I can't recall but I did think through
[11:15] Nuck: It's gonna be a pain in the ass, I'm sure
[11:16] augustl: thar: https://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues/1182
[11:17] AAA_awright: Nuck: You might want to allow users to organize works in other ways too, I have a collection of inspiration for a movie I'm writing, and another for "very wide" works with an aspect ratio > 2.4

[11:17] Nuck: AAA_awright: Well yeah, we'll have ways to group 'em together
[11:17] AAA_awright: I have a "Likes" too, to avoid the default, but loaded word, Favorites
[11:17] AAA_awright: Which has what, 20 or so works?
[11:17] gqlewis has joined the channel
[11:18] AAA_awright: Likes as a general rule of thumb is stuff I might want to go back to later for some reason
[11:18] CrisO has joined the channel
[11:18] AAA_awright: That's more like 200
[11:18] AAA_awright: Anyways
[11:18] Nuck: AAA_awright: Like is a simple way to jsut say "I dig this" without saying "this is my favorite thing ever"
[11:18] AAA_awright: Yep
[11:18] Nuck: Hence why fave = 2 x like
[11:18] AAA_awright: That's rather arbritary
[11:19] Nuck: Aye, I went for even numbers
[11:19] Nuck: 1.0 for face, 0.5 for like
[11:19] AAA_awright: Well, saying it's 2x or any x is going to cause problems maybe
[11:19] Nuck: I'll tweak them as I improve the algo
[11:19] Nuck: AAA_awright: I'm more worried about not getting our frontend done at this point :S
[11:20] Nuck: I've got the foundations for a View setup built
[11:20] AAA_awright: Nuck: You probably have to assume that anything witout a like or a fav, could *potentially* be a like or a fav, but the user hasn't decided on it, yet you know the user can't favorite all the works, so based on the ones they have favorited, which of the remaining also deserve a favorite
[11:20] Nuck: AAA_awright... WAT
[11:20] Nuck: AAA_awright: I'm not gonna pretend they like things they don't
[11:21] rakesh314 has left the channel
[11:21] AAA_awright: Unless there's a dislike button you have to assume they could like it, even if they've already dismissed it in reality, since there's no way to know
[11:21] AAA_awright: The "Like" provides an additional bit of info, too, it demonstrates that they have looked at it
[11:21] Nuck: It'll study the tags and display things that it thinks they'll like.
[11:21] AAA_awright: Tags of what?
[11:21] AAA_awright: Text tags?
[11:21] Nuck: tags of artwork
[11:21] Nuck: It's not categorized, it's tagged
[11:22] Nuck: Similar to Danbooru
[11:22] AAA_awright: Ah yes
[11:22] Nuck: But with some added features and groupings
[11:22] AAA_awright: But that's not going to tell you what style it's in
[11:22] Nuck: It will
[11:22] Nuck: Because it will have medium and descriptor tags
[11:22] Nuck: is it a landscape?
[11:23] Nuck: Was it done in pastels?
[11:23] AAA_awright: There's a whole lot of information you have at your disposal, Favorites, Likes, other user categories/collections, tags/category, user comments (seriously, train a spam filter on the comments for each work)
[11:23] Nuck: I weight all the tags on every artwork a user liked or faved
[11:23] AAA_awright: Views (maybe)
[11:24] Nuck: Aye, but I'm following the rule of KISS
[11:24] Nuck: By keeping it from having too many things in it, I'm making sure it's shit they'll like.
[11:24] AAA_awright: I would avoid using view count, or logging each user's view, and avoid recommending based on tag, because that could infect which tags people select in order to get it seen more
[11:24] AAA_awright: Well, just keep it modularized, KISS follows
[11:25] Nuck: Mistagging will be reportable and community-moderatable
[11:25] AAA_awright: But there are algorithms to use to determine which works a user probably does/would like but hasn't yet
[11:25] AAA_awright: Ah very good
[11:26] Nuck: AAA_awright: The biggest problem for me is implementatiin.
[11:26] Nuck: I've no idea how to implement an algorithm like that.
[11:26] Nuck: I mean, it's a pretty major thing.
[11:26] AAA_awright: I would need to work out the math on this too, I'm guessing though, that solving 500x500 matricies is a no-no
[11:26] Nuck: This could be the thing that breaks all my servers lol
[11:26] tayy has joined the channel
[11:27] AAA_awright: For other projects I was predicting outcomes of matches with 50x50 matricies and that took 10-20 seconds to compute
[11:27] Nuck: There's two things I'm worried are gonna block the development of Fakooda: (1) the algorithm (2) the frontend
[11:28] AAA_awright: You don't _have_ to have an algorithm, but that would be cool

[11:28] Nuck: I want this to be front-and-center.

[11:29] Nuck: lol
[11:29] AAA_awright: I'm paying for help with this IRC client of mine?
[11:29] Nuck: AAA_awright: lol I can't believe people actually use bitcoins
[11:30] AAA_awright: I have 8 transactions including 2 generated blocks
[11:30] Nuck: How much do you think it'd take to get a newbie JS coder to bite?
[11:30] Nuck: AAA_awright: Damn, you generated blocks?
[11:30] Nuck: Those people are always the rich folk :(
[11:30] AAA_awright: When it was $0.06/Bitcoin
[11:30] AAA_awright: Haven't sold it
[11:30] Nuck: AAA_awright: Oooh, I'd cash out now X3
[11:31] guidocalvano has joined the channel
[11:31] Nuck: 0.06 --> $13
[11:31] AAA_awright: I tried to get out at $30 but my account didn't get setup in time
[11:31] Nuck: That's what, a 20000% increase
[11:31] AAA_awright: It's crazy
[11:33] AAA_awright: Nuck: This was before GPU mining and when $0.07 was supposed to be a bubble, and the i7 was ramping up the temperature of the room by a cozy +15F so I stopped for electricicy costs

[11:40] Nuck: And said "uhhhhhh no"
[11:41] AAA_awright: Nuck: That's what I'm doing for my IRC client, Bitcoins only actually
[11:41] Nuck: AAA_awright: I just wanna be able to cash out.  But bitcoins directly isn't the safest thing, even if I buffered myself with an added charge :S
[11:42] AAA_awright: For the end user it's a whole lot safer than a credit card number
[11:42] Nuck: I discussed it with my CTO and CMO and both agreed that it was too unstable.
[11:42] Nuck: AAA_awright: I'm more worried about the value suddenly decreasing in a matter of hours

[11:47] TheJH: xerox, what do you want to do?

[11:49] xerox: TheJH: node puts such an emphasis on the http protocol, might as well use it properly : )
[11:50] xerox: Bonuspunk: hmm by building an XHR?
[11:51] Bonuspunk: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ --> accepts
[11:52] AAA_awright: Nuck: The most objective way to rate something is higher or lower than another thing, so Which-kitten-is-cuter websites are the most objective, actually
[11:52] AAA_awright: Because any decision making process can be serilized down to a ranked list
[11:52] AAA_awright: Now there might be some contradicting opinions too, like A>B and B>C but C>A
[11:53] xerox: Bonuspunk: that could indeed work, so I guess browsers just don't give you a way to do it with their requests directly
[11:53] AAA_awright: So that might demand a matrix to work out
[11:53] AAA_awright: And there's ways to estimate the solution of a matrix without solving it
[11:54] Nuck: AAA_awright: Aye, that is true, but it implies that one artwork is better than another
[11:54] Nuck: There is no better in thsi case, only relevancy
[11:54] AAA_awright: That's correct
[11:55] Nuck: Is it more relevant or is it less relevant?
[11:55] AAA_awright: To what?
[11:55] Nuck: to the user
[11:55] AAA_awright: Whether they actually like it or not?
[11:56] Nuck: AAA_awright: The idea is that content is what makes the artwork most relevant to the user.
[11:56] Nuck: Quality plays a role in this too
[11:56] gqlewis has joined the channel

[11:57] AAA_awright: Well, no matter what you call it, if you can rank it, then there's your sugguestions
[11:57] Nuck: AAA_awright: I typed 2 paragraphs describing the ranking algorithm on my iPhone
[11:58] AAA_awright: Nuck: Maybe you also want to have "If you liked this then based on your favorites/likes you'll also like... " and proceed to sugguest what works would become more likely to be sugguested if the user were to favorite it
[11:58] AAA_awright: Is that something you had in mind?
[11:58] uchuff has joined the channel
[11:59] Nuck: AAA_awright: I'm gonna have a "More like this" thing
[11:59] AAA_awright: And also a generic "Artwork you may like" by category?
[12:00] Nuck: That will be our default main page
[12:00] Nuck: A display of shit a person might like
[12:01] Nuck: AAA_awright: You seem smart, you make tha algorithm for me ;D
[12:01] Nuck: And make it snappy! </troll>
[12:01] AAA_awright: There was something I had in my mind and I forget it...
[12:02] AAA_awright: Oh spaghetti sause!
[12:02] Nuck: AAA_awright: dAmn is spaghetti code.
[12:03] AAA_awright: It should also be somewhat capable of organizing sugguestions into groups, note who belongs to what groups and weigh sugguestions accordingly
[12:03] chjj: "scoliosis aviator"
[12:03] chjj: thats a captcha i just got
[12:03] Nuck: AAA_awright: I'm thinking of making it modular so I can run it over single pieces or sets of artworks
[12:03] Nuck: With given weights
[12:04] Nuck: So to do the mainpage, I'd call a function for each artwork
[12:04] Nuck: that is faved or liked
[12:04] Nuck: problem is, this might be heavyweight
[12:04] Nuck: Slow down the site
[12:04] AAA_awright: So me liking lots of fantasy will sugguest fantasy but not automatically other genres that other people don't always like (say some people who like fantasy like furry and landscapes, but we don't want to jump to the conclusion that everyone does), but there's a way I can find out what other genres I might learn to like (Oh people who like these styles of artwork also like those styles)

[12:07] Nuck: AAA_awright: Iiiiiiii don't even know what a vector is :|
[12:08] AAA_awright: An ordered pair is a two dimensional vector
[12:08] AAA_awright: A vector is just a one-column matrix
[12:08] Nuck: I don't see how this applies to an algorithm :S
[12:09] fraserkillip has joined the channel
[12:09] Nuck: I'm gonna be honest, all I did was mathematically rank the tags that a user likes
[12:09] Nuck: simple iteration
[12:09] Nuck: amidoinitwrong
[12:09] AAA_awright: If you calculated a 200x200 matrix for each user, you could assign a vector to each artwork, and get back out a 200d matrix
[12:09] AAA_awright: or something
[12:09] TheJH: hey guys, can you recommend a simple javascript tokenizer (written in javascript and tokenizes javascript)?
[12:09] AAA_awright: And you use that to determine how likely the user is to fav or like it
[12:09] AAA_awright: TheJH: PEG
[12:09] AAA_awright: Oh
[12:09] AAA_awright: For JS
[12:10] AAA_awright: TheJH: I'm looking for one myself... You figure V8 would have some builtin lib that we could access to do it
[12:10] Nuck: AAA_awright: I'm not trying to predict if they're gonna fave or like each artwork
[12:10] AAA_awright: There's the PHP tokenizer after all
[12:10] AAA_awright: Nuck: You could use this to do whatever, so long as there's an objective way to determine your input
[12:10] Nuck: I'm trying to figure out a list of artworks that fit with their historical preferences

[12:11] AAA_awright: I have an inkling of the right way to do it in my head
[12:11] AAA_awright: What would I do with it?
[12:11] Nuck: AAA_awright: IUNO
[12:12] Nuck: AAA_awright: I have it in my iPhone's notes section :lol:
[12:12] AAA_awright: Nuck: Maybe you need to explain what you're sugguesting... If all you have to go off of is likes and faves, you're going to get back probability of like/fav
[12:12] Nuck: AAA_awright: I measure it more as relevance.  I look at tags on previous likes and faves
[12:13] AAA_awright: Tags would just weight it maybe
[12:13] AAA_awright: Interestingly enough, if you have enough data, the pattern of favorites/likes could be more accurate than the user-specified tags
[12:14] Nuck: IT's a combination
[12:14] AAA_awright: For seperating out art styles and content
[12:14] Nuck: It uses faves/likes as a tag-value multiplier
[12:15] Nuck: If you fave 12 artworks with the tag "landscapes", it'll give that tag a value of 12.  An artwork that has that tag therefore gains 12 points.
[12:16] Nuck: if it has another tag with 10 points, it is now at 120 points
[12:16] Nuck: Because I multiply

[20:33] mnaser: try doing server.listen(8000) only
[20:34] shayfalador: well
[20:34] qbert: Ramosa, yes for sure

[20:37] mscdex: shayfalador: most likely
[20:37] shayfalador: can you explain me how? or link me?
[20:37] mscdex: shayfalador: if you don't specify an ip, it does use 0.0.0.0, which listens on all interfaces
[20:37] shayfalador: I tried to google it earlier and found nothing

[20:42] Ramosa: what folder should I be in when I run npm? i just tried npm install mongoose in some random folder and it created nodes_modules/mongoose .. is that just an install folder that I can remove?
[20:43] mnaser: Ramosa: if you do npm install -g module -- it will install it globally, you should run it in your application root
[20:43] mnaser: and then when it creates that, you can do "var module = require("mongoose").whatever"
[20:43] mnaser: nodejs would look for mongoose in the node_modules folder or the global store (but its better to install them locally instead of globally)
[20:44] shayfalador: Guys, I need the "Internal Host IP Address"
[20:44] shayfalador: The ipconfig says
[20:44] lot49 has joined the channel
[20:44] seivan: Ok
[20:44] seivan: #  app.use(app.router) and connect-auth are no goes
[20:44] shayfalador: IPv4 Address 10.0.0.2
[20:44] Ramosa: mnaser, how do I undo the install I just did then?
[20:44] shayfalador: Default Gateway 10.0.0.138
[20:45] shayfalador: Which one I need?
[20:45] tmzt_: looks well matched to Backbone as well
[20:45] mnaser: shayfalador: 10.0.0.2
[20:45] shayfalador: Ok, thank you again :)
[20:45] mnaser: Ramosa, same.  npm uninstall module or globally uninstall it (if you globally installed it) npm uninstall module -g
[20:46] shayfalador: It still won't work
[20:46] Ramosa: mnaser, thanks.. I wish npm would be more verbose about its processing like apt-get
[20:46] tmzt_: one step away from building a directory based router configuration structure like other MVCs
[20:47] shayfalador: When I insert it I get a screen just like here: http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/BT/Voyager240/VNC.htm
[20:47] shayfalador: In the end of the page
[20:47] mnaser: Ramosa: there might be a verbose switch
[20:47] mnaser: did you press apply, shayfalador?
[20:47] shayfalador: yeah
[20:48] mnaser: try using their port check program
[20:48] davidcoallier has joined the channel
[20:48] shayfalador: I already deleted it
[20:48] shayfalador: trying it again
[20:48] shayfalador: I am not sure what do I need to insert
[20:48] shayfalador: What should insert in "External Packet	" and "Forward to Internal Host" lables? :/
[20:48] shayfalador: thank you so much again
[20:49] mnaser: external package port start and port end is the port you want, so 8000
[20:50] mnaser: and the same on the other end, 8000
[20:50] mnaser: think of the router as a host that gets someone at door 8000 from outside, and tells them to check into room 8000 inside.
[20:50] mnaser: if you wanted to forward port 3000 to 4000 internally, it would be 3000 external and 4000 internal
[20:50] shayfalador: *thought
[20:50] shayfalador: yeah that's what I taught
[20:50] shayfalador: but it still doesn't work
[20:51] hassox has joined the channel
[20:51] shayfalador: In the code I use "server.listen(8000);"
[20:51] shayfalador: The router's screen says "nodejs 	ALL 	TCP 	8000 	10.0.0.2 	8000"
[20:51] shayfalador: It seems fine to me
[20:51] mnaser: is your pc's static ip actaully 10.0.0.2?
[20:51] adrianmg has joined the channel
[20:51] shayfalador: I don't really know

[20:54] shayfalador: mnaser: this is what I have got for now http://i56.tinypic.com/2dmb0k5.jpg
[20:55] mnaser: okay once you start it.. you should be able to acces it by gonig to
[20:55] mnaser: http://publicip:8000/
[20:55] mnaser: get your public ip from http://whatismyip.com
[20:55] shayfalador: I got it from here http://www.whatismyip.org/
[20:55] shayfalador: shouldn't matter
[20:55] mnaser: yeah, doesn't wor?
[20:56] shayfalador: works via http://127.0.0.1:8000/
[20:56] mnaser: but not with your public IP?
[20:56] shayfalador: yup
[20:56] mnaser: try disabling windows firewall
[20:56] mnaser: and try again
[20:56] mnaser: it might very well be blocking it

[21:00] shayfalador: as if it was doing something
[21:00] shayfalador: or turning on
[21:01] mnaser: cant help you with that because i dont use that router
