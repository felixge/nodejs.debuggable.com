[00:02] hoik: so, if i wanted to send some data to my python program (ie, to to the unix socket i guess), and then get a response.. how (vaguely) would i implement that in node ??
[00:02] hackband has joined the channel
[00:03] niallo: hoik: i'm using zeromq and also tcp to communicate between node and python
[00:03] niallo: hoik: node makes it pretty easy to use both these protocols.
[00:03] dlg: niallo: fancy seeing you here
[00:04] hoik: can i ask why you use zeromq?
[00:04] niallo: hey dlg. doing node stuff i guess?
[00:05] panosru: hoik: you can use any MQ system if you like, it is (in my opinion) the best way to communicate between different technologies from within the system, I personally use RabbitMQ
[00:05] niallo: hoik: i use the push/pull sockets because it solves my problem.
[00:06] panosru: niallo: have you tried RabbitMQ ? if yes I'm just curious if you prefer ZeroMQ over RabbitMQ and why :) Thanks
[00:06] niallo: panosru: have not used it.
[00:07] Dmitriju1: panosru: i do prefer zeromq :) although i've used rabbitmq for a while
[00:07] panosru: niallo: ok, cool :)
[00:07] panosru: Dmitriju1: I use RabbitMQ for about two years now and I could say I don't have any complain about it, but I'm always open for suggestions :D
[00:08] panosru: Dmitriju1: I know that "if something works don't touch it" but I don't believe in that phrase :P I prefer "if something can work better then use it" :)
[00:09] Dmitriju1: panosru: well, dunno which one is better, just i prefer the simplicity zeromq provides
[00:09] sauerbraten: can someone have a look at this? program exits normally, but nothing is written to the redis db :/ http://pastie.org/3404959
[00:09] hoik: Dmitriju1, panosru : i see.. not come across MQ before.. this is the main purpose of it? ..is it just easier than using unix sockets (./whats the advantage?)
[00:09] Dmitriju1: panosru: in rabbitmq i sometimes had to connect to teh erlang shell and kill corresponding erlang processes....
[00:09] dlg: niallo: annoying bnoordhuis
[00:10] sauerbraten: oh, and _redis.print outputs "undefined" all the time

[00:11] panosru: hoik: to be honest I don't really know if it is the purpose of MQ but I guess it could be, you could check it here too (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue) but JS purpose wasn't to be server side either but it is now and it works very well too :P
[00:11] tdubz has joined the channel
[00:12] panosru: hoik: regarding unix sockets, I prefer MQ to be honest but I don't have any strong argument behind that preference... it is just a preference.. maybe because I can have a control panel and setting up permissions and etc for my queue vhosts could be used as an argument

[00:16] hoik: @pansoru ... thanks.. seems like it would probably be unnecessary additional software for my case i think, unless there is a killer app that i'm missing.

Would you rather have your server bombarded with polling to give no updates, or have a completely silten tcp/ip connection in those cases?

[03:42] eukreign1: which js engines do not support __proto__?
[03:43] Gregor: In the lowest common denominator ES5, you can neither call a non-function or create a function with prototype other than Function.prototype (unless I am misremembering and there's a loophole)
[03:43] Gregor: IE is the only engine that doesn't support overriding __proto__, but rumblings suggest that others want to remove it.
[03:44] Gregor: Object.create also creates prototype chains, but can't create functions.

[04:06] eukreign1: or is pretty much the one and only way to set chainable prototypes is to use new on a Function?

[06:21] Emmanuel: how do one chose between different NoSQL servers ?
[06:22] Emmanuel: like, how can I tell the difference between Redis and MongoDB ?
[06:23] Emmanuel: apart from googling it of course
[06:23] raja: Emmanuel: How about trying them
[06:24] raja: redis and mongo are very different
[06:26] Emmanuel: It's not really about the way they work
[06:27] Emmanuel: it's about what they are designed for
[06:27] Emmanuel: reading that : http://www.cloudcomputingdevelopment.net/nosql-databases-and-node-js/
[06:27] Emmanuel: that seems to confirm my first impression that "Redis is a data store well-suited for handling simple, relatively ephemeral data such as logs, votes, and messages."
[06:28] Emmanuel: while "MongoDB is a general-purpose non-relational database. Itâ€™s used for the same sort of applications as a relational database management system (RDBMS) and is well regarded for its performance capabilities."
[06:28] Emmanuel: and I definitely need more of the second than the first

[13:11] teslan: oh, i am new to the whole web development but this whole idea of javascript, "next tick", callback functions ... as if it was not true even in COBOL in banking systems, but for the first time, i am measuring 10 times and barely daring to cut once and feeling that for the first time my code is exposed to all kinds of elements ... so, i am testing like never before and i am 'efficiency' minded like never before and so on and so on ;)
[13:11] ningu: funny, I find that I don't need to engineer things as heavily in node to get them to work reasonably
[13:12] ningu: admittedly, I've only been using it for a week or two
[13:12] zomg: teslan: heh :)
[13:12] zomg: well it does take some getting used to at first I guess if you're used to things being synchronous
[13:12] ningu: but my past experience was Catalyst in perl -- and that was presumably less heavy than Java but still not as nice
[13:12] ningu: yeah, the async stuff takes some getting used to

[13:18] zomg: teslan: I'm sure you could code around us in circles in COBOL or something ;)
[13:19] ningu: teslan: haha, no, I've been doing some sort of web dev since I was like 13, in the sense that I learned html then, but I've never been really good at it (css drives me crazy for example).

[13:25] ningu: when I was 13 and on vacation without a computer I wrote out ideas for ircII scripts in a notebook
[13:25] zomg: teslan: I have met a person who used punch card machines IRL, that's the closest I've ever come to those machines :D
[13:25] teslan: the fonts on those punch cards were fantastic looking rectengular holes
[13:26] ningu: zomg: I was at maker faire last year and they had a cool computer history museum exhibit, no punch card machines but very early pcs

[13:27] TheJH: ACTION doesn't want to use punchcards
[13:27] zomg: TheJH: probably, I'm not sure how well it would recognize special characters
[13:27] ningu: I wonder if curly brace recognition is any good
[13:27] zomg: but otherwise it's probably pretty decent
[13:27] jinmo123: huh, can i ask a question?
[13:27] TheJH: jinmo123, you just did

[13:36] spolu has joined the channel
[13:37] jinmo123: i think node.js can be booooorrrrrrring

[13:38] Onkeltem: jinmo123: like javascript?
[13:38] jinmo123: yeah, i second that
[13:38] Onkeltem: like PHP I meant
[13:38] bbenvie: RoR is not sexy
[13:38] jinmo123: yeah i think so
[13:38] bbenvie: it's ok
[13:38] Onkeltem: I tried ror
[13:38] Onkeltem: any ruby is nice
[13:39] bbenvie: clojur
[13:39] jinmo123: js is sexy, but modules and callbacks annoyed me(not now, but i feel stress)
[13:39] bbenvie: as it should be spelled
[13:39] jinmo123: callback is annoying
[13:40] bbenvie: I call it time travel
[13:40] ningu: when you're interviewing for a job you want callbacks though
[13:40] teslan: so what do you think of this noob naming convention ... var url_mod = require("url") ... and... var request_npm = require("request")
[13:40] bbenvie: path annoys me actually
[13:40] bbenvie: because I really really want to use that for variable names
[13:40] ningu: teslan: people usually just name the variables the same as the modules
[13:41] ningu: teslan: but it doesn't matter much...
[13:41] bbenvie: and always at the same time I need the path module

[13:43] bbenvie: php gets to take responsibility for being shitty to begin with too though
[13:43] teslan: one of the biggest mind blockers (: far worse then i/o blocking :) for us procedural old timers coming over to class based systems is looking at a piece of code and knowing what on earth it points to ... is it from some core class, an add on or a locally define object ... etc ;)
[13:43] ningu: jinmo123: the connect middleware is excellent. express is a fairly thin layer over it, really, but I've found it has some nice facilities as well.
[13:44] Onkeltem: Is express a good point to start?
[13:45] ningu: teslan: js is worse, everything is an object, even classes, and inheritance is kind of roundabout (in the sense of being able to read the code and figure it out)
[13:45] ningu: teslan: it's also a huge strength of js though, imo... everything is a tradeoff :)
[13:45] ningu: Onkeltem: sure, why not?

[14:13] teslan: console.log = function(){};

[14:15] AndreasMadsen: Not sure what you mean with debug mode
[14:16] broofa has joined the channel
[14:17] teslan: AndreasMadsen: that was from an existing stackoverflow suggestion ... but are those process parameters, startup parameters and i was thinking more along the lines of ?log=true, so that anyone could turn it one on any request ... so, turning console.log into /dev/null would be ideal ;)
[14:18] teslan: turn it on, on any one request ;)
[14:18] teslan: *
[14:18] jinmo123: wow, good idea. thanks, i will use that!
[14:19] jinmo123: how about logging for test account> logging? haha
[14:20] AndreasMadsen: teslan: DEBUG_MODE_ON is not something node.js provide.
[14:21] herbySk74 has joined the channel
[14:21] AndreasMadsen: but you could implement it by doing gobal.DEBUG_MODE_ON = (process.argv.indexOf('--debug') !== -1)
[14:22] AndreasMadsen: then if you call your node program with like this "node script.js arg1 arg2 --debug" it would log print the output.
[14:22] teslan: sorry, that was a js example , i am guessing for browsers
[14:23] teslan: jinmo123: so is redefining of console.log = function(){} the most efficient?
[14:23] AndreasMadsen: teslan: redefining process.stdout.write is the best option.
[14:23] jinmo123: yeah

[14:28] DrHeiter: that's true

[16:15] cburyta has joined the channel
[16:15] eamonnw: i have node.js installed
[16:15] Sly__: eamonnw, `npm install jquery`
[16:15] Sly__: var jquery = require('jquery');
[16:15] eamonnw: Sly__: thanks ive just done that
[16:16] eamonnw: var jquery = require('jquery'); i type that on the node.js command line?
[16:16] andrehjr has joined the channel
[16:16] eamonnw: ok 
[16:16] Sly__: You use that wherever you're wanting to use jQuery.
[16:16] EhevuTov has joined the channel
[16:16] eamonnw: seems to work
[16:16] Sly__: Then jquery will be assigned the jQuery module that you installed via `npm install jquery`.
[16:17] eamonnw: ok how can i run some jquery stuff againts a local file or remote http site?
[16:17] eamonnw: npm install jQuery jsdom htmlparser xmlhttprequest

[16:44] mmalecki: actually, wondering if I could run node there
[16:44] humasect: linux kernel bits into JS ??
[16:44] ningu: my current node project is js top to bottom -- node on backend, js in browser, mongodb. quite common now I suppose.
[16:45] ningu: oh, I do have a little perl script that I run because I haven't ported it to js...
[16:45] TheFuzzball has joined the channel
[16:46] humasect: i've been using some things on top of JS, using it as a bytecode/vm .. ^_^ 
[16:46] ningu: humasect: how so?
[16:47] humasect: ningu: using ClojureScript now mostly, but used to use Objective-J, CoffeeScript, Parenscript, etc..

[16:48] humasect: hmm yeah it seems so. and thanks to node.js can also have it on front and backends =) 
[16:49] ningu: so far I haven't actually made much direct use of the fact that the client also runs js
[16:49] themiddleman_itv has joined the channel
[16:49] TheFuzzball has joined the channel
[16:49] ningu: I mean, I have js code on the client side, but it doesn't interface much with the server side, they just pass json around
[16:50] ningu: there must be some interesting possibilities there though
[16:50] humasect: ohh, yeah ^_^ it becomes useful with code sharing i think, or for example, sending code to client from server directly (avoiding any real 'static' files except external libs)
[16:50] mmalecki: damn, copying tarball there sure is painful
[16:50] humasect: ningu: games, is one very interesting application for me ^_^ 
[16:51] ningu: hmm, sending generated code you mean? that's an interesting though
[16:51] ningu: thought*
[16:51] ningu: of course, you can generate js code from templates of any kind, no need for js on the server end
[16:52] ningu: I guess it really comes in handy with code sharing as you said, if there's a library you need on both sides
[16:52] humasect: yeah.. lets say, if we are doing some validation on the server for some data. it can be moved over to the client side very very easily. with all this distributed and cloud stuff, the line between client and server is blurring fast ^_^ 
[16:52] daniel has joined the channel
[16:52] ningu: yes, but you never want to eliminate server side validation of course -- I guess it just makes it easy to duplicate it on the client side

[17:16] deni: does anyone use log.io? i've tried installing it but it fails saying that i have the wrong node version
[17:17] humasect: why does npm put into ./node_modules/ ? im confused ^_^
[17:17] wookiehangover: deni: engines: { node: '0.4.12' }
[17:17] deni: but if install the 0.4.12 version which is recommended i can't seem to run npm because it says it needs a newer version of node
[17:17] isaacs: humasect: it keeps your deps isolated to each project
[17:17] humasect: hmm npm has version support for node, to use multiple versions 
[17:18] wookiehangover: deni: that's the trouble with using old modules

[17:19] deni: well that's not gonna happen any time soon
[17:19] deni: :D
[17:19] deni: someting more quicker?
[17:19] deni: am i using the wrong version of npm maybe?

[17:19] dannyamey has joined the channel

[17:20] isaacs: ircretary: inst deni
[17:20] ircretary: deni: `curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh` (or, if there are permission issues, you can try: `curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh`)
[17:20] humasect: no no, new version of node, like it suggests ^1
[17:20] isaacs: deni: or just use node 0.6.10 :)
[17:20] isaacs: er, 0.6.11 now, i guess :)
[17:21] looopy has joined the channel
[17:22] hij1nx_ has joined the channel
[17:22] humasect: i think, for projects on github, that node_modules should be git submodules ..

[17:23] kwmiebach has joined the channel
[17:24] kbhit has joined the channel
[17:25] deni: isaacs: should i use the 0.3x version of npm with node 0.4.12?
[17:26] isaacs: humasect: you've clearly not used git submodules much.
[17:26] isaacs: deni: no, 1.0
[17:26] isaacs: deni: 1.1 is 0.6 and above.
[17:26] deni: isaacs: ok tnx.
[17:26] deni: oh and about git submodules....i use them a lot....it works just fine
[17:26] isaacs: deni: npm 0.x is old stone-age garbage.
[17:27] danielss89 has joined the channel
[17:27] isaacs: i tried for years to appreciate submodules.
[17:27] isaacs: it's great, except for the fact that it ruins branching, merging, and bisect, which is basically all that makes git awesome.
[17:27] deni: i don't think you can really compare them to the one you have now in the newest version of git
[17:27] deni: as i understandt they did much work on them
[17:28] deni: isaacs: i don't really have any problems with branching, merging 
[17:28] isaacs: deni: what version of git has submodules that aren't terrible?  because i think making them not-terrible would be enough of a major change that it'd require calling it something different
[17:29] deni: isaacs: we have quite a few memebers in out team and a projects that's gown out of proportions....it's really big, and has several technologies in it and what not
[17:29] deni: and we have had no trouble what so ever with git
[17:29] deni: using submodules
[17:29] isaacs: deni: here's where i found that submodules became intolerable:
[17:30] isaacs: let's say, you're using a bunch of submodules in a project, right?
[17:30] isaacs: and you'er working on version 1.0
[17:30] isaacs: now, you want to make 1.0 a branch, and start working on 1.1 in master.
[17:30] deni: ok
[17:30] isaacs: pretty common, right?
[17:30] deni: yep
[17:30] isaacs: except, that 1.0 needs different versions of its dependencies, and different dependencies.
[17:30] isaacs: so you remove some submodules, update others, etc.
[17:31] isaacs: add a few new ones
[17:31] deni: so far so good
[17:31] isaacs: merging between the branches is now extremely painful.
[17:31] isaacs: and, inf act, even *switching* between branches is tedious and awful.
[17:31] isaacs: git complains incessantly about untracked crap being in the way, unable to check out submodules, etc.
[17:31] diogosnows has joined the channel
[17:31] wookiehangover: isaacs: true story
[17:31] isaacs: that's why npm's node_modules is just checked into git now.
[17:31] isaacs: also?  i can actually diff changes in the deps!
[17:32] wookiehangover: crazy talk
[17:32] isaacs: or update them in one branch, and merge the update over to the other branch

[17:44] deni: isaacs: it not always the best thing to do things the way they are supposed to be done.....sometimes if you have such a use case you need to step out of the box and do things differently.....it's always best to be productive
[17:44] isaacs: humasect: if it's a website that you're deploying, then git add node_modules is the way to go.
[17:44] humasect: deni +1
[17:44] deni: if the submodules were getting in the way of your work, and they have, then why use them
[17:44] isaacs: deni: exactly
[17:44] humasect: isaacs: oh yeah =) if publishing with push ?

[17:48] sven_oostenbrink: Question.. I have a shell script that will automaticallhy minify my client side javascripts using uglify.js.. Since this script must run on difference environments with different uglify.js versions, I can not do something like node ~/.npm/uglify/etc...  Can I tell node somehow to execute the best uglify.js version that it can find?
[17:49] bradleymeck has joined the channel
[17:49] isaacs: wdbl: interesting.  i didn't even realize that node's servers could do such a thing :) investigating now

[17:50] deni: isaacs: when isntalling with npm what does 'no such environment: default'
[17:50] deni: mean?
[17:50] isaacs: deni: that's not an npm error.  i'd have to see the context.
[17:50] deni: or is that not something that npm outputs?
[17:50] deni: hmm
[17:50] sven_oostenbrink: So basically, I can not say node path/uglify.js, I just want to do node uglify.js, and if uglify.js is installed in whichever path, whichever version, use that one.. basically like require does..

[17:54] isaacs: deni: but it looks like it just soldiered on
[17:55] isaacs: sven_oostenbrink: there's already an uglify package on npm

[17:55] isaacs: sven_oostenbrink: if you list it as a dependency, and then have a package.json "scripts" thing that you run, it'll just be `uglify`, and in the path already.

[19:16] cagdas: hi
[19:16] cagdas: is there a problem with ubuntu + npm?
[19:16] sigurding: the questions for me is: building something like that on my own, or using existing solutions
[19:16] cagdas: I used apt-get install npm and tried to install packages
[19:16] vdemedes: sigurding: well yeah, Premium users on Drops have ability to upload up to 100 mb per file
[19:16] cagdas: with npm install <package>
[19:16] vdemedes: sigurding: and many of them in one request
[19:17] cagdas: but it just returns
[19:17] cagdas: "npm ok"
[19:17] vdemedes: sigurding: however, I don't know someone who uploaded 3-4 gb
[19:17] vdemedes: but that does not mean it is not possible
[19:17] sigurding: vdemedes: great to talk to someone who already did things like that
[19:17] arcanis has joined the channel
[19:17] sigurding: vdemedes: I actually don't want the user to upload 3-4gb. they should instead rar the files, upload it and that's all

[19:18] sigurding: vdemedes: do you have any figures?
[19:18] vdemedes: sigurding: but, if you want to be super-reliable, and if you are building desktop app, you could upload to Amazon S3(for example) right from the app, avoiding HTTP server
[19:19] sigurding: vdemedes: no no no desktop app. that's oldschool :-)
[19:19] sigurding: it is a web app

[19:20] vdemedes: sigurding: if its a web app, I do not recommend allowing to upload more than 500 mb per request
[19:21] sigurding: vdemedes: that's what I was expecting :)
[19:21] vdemedes: but, you can always do some test
[19:21] vdemedes: tests
[19:21] arcanis has joined the channel
[19:21] vdemedes: don't forget to repeat them in many browser and different OS

[19:27] cagdas: I installed node and npm with "sudo apt-get install nodejs npm"
[19:27] sigurding: and then I have been there in July and it had 30 degress plus
[19:27] vdemedes: cagdas: don't recommend you to do that. Just use ./configure + make
[19:27] cagdas: now I try "npm install config" and it installs the 0.2.9 version
[19:27] cagdas: I see
[19:27] vdemedes: sigurding: :-D âˆ’15 is cold? You are lucky that you are not here now :-D
[19:28] cagdas: what is the problem with ubuntu packages?
[19:28] cagdas: not maintened well?
[19:28] vdemedes: sigurding: it is getting hotter now, but it was like âˆ’25 â€” âˆ’30 for a week or two

[19:28] cagdas: who is maintaining ubuntu packages?

[19:29] sigurding: vdemedes: so a summary: I needs some time to get used to the temperaturegaps, but I like your food, and like the your people. In Kharkov there were many very smart and open minded people
[19:29] vdemedes: sigurding: ooh, don't talk about great people. There are only few of them.

[19:41] megalomix: i mean, do i have to start the application doing: $ NODE_ENV=production node app.js
[19:41] vdemedes: sigurding: Formidable is production-tested, and formaline too(I use it in Drops)
[19:41] cagdas: maxogden, yes, I know
[19:42] megalomix: OR can i set the production mode for all the applications i will start ?
[19:42] cagdas: vdemedes, I try to understand the ubuntu way
[19:42] mmalecki: vdemedes: http://blog.end3r.com/ is pretty popular (at least so I've heard)
[19:42] sigurding: vdemedes: and formaline is an additional layer on formidable?
[19:42] vdemedes: megalomix: I recommend you to use NODE_ENV per every launch
[19:42] cagdas: and I think it's important when you want to build some packages
[19:42] vdemedes: sigurding: nope, its a separate module
[19:43] vdemedes: cagdas: It is Linux-way too :-)

[19:44] vdemedes: mmalecki: thanks, that would be even more awesome!
[19:44] dnjaramba_ has joined the channel
[19:44] megalomix: vdemedes, every launch? why?
[19:45] vdemedes: megalomix: to avoid some bugs and possible confusions, because of forgeting that you are in production mode
[19:46] cagdas: vdemedes, oh, it's fixed when I have followed the instruction in the github page
[19:46] cagdas: but mainly npm was not working
[19:46] vdemedes: cagdas: ahah :-) ok, getting back to our apt-get vs make discussion?
[19:46] vdemedes: :-D
[19:47] cagdas: hmm, strange, I've a package.json file and I try npm install, it doesn't install package dependencies
[19:47] sigurding: vdemedes: taking a look at github.com/rootslab/formaline, it seems that formaline provides more features than formidable?
[19:47] vdemedes: cagdas: maybe bad-formatted JSON? Show it!
[19:47] vdemedes: sigurding: yep, but they do basically the same thing :-) Parsing request bodies!
[19:48] vdemedes: sigurding: they are both awesome, and you can choose one you like
[19:48] sigurding: :)
[19:48] mmalecki: vdemedes: http://rubysfera.pl/
[19:48] sigurding: ok, then I will take a look at formaline first. thanks a lot for your help vdemedes 
[19:48] sigurding: enjoyed talking to you

[19:52] vdemedes: cagdas: any serious reason you are specifying versions for each of your dependencies?
[19:52] cagdas: I don't get now
[19:53] cagdas: somehow deleting node_modules and doing npm install worked
[19:53] vdemedes: :-)
[19:53] cagdas: vdemedes, I guess I can also use "latest" right?
[19:54] vdemedes: cagdas: nope, "*" instead
[19:54] vdemedes: just *
[19:54] cagdas: vdemedes, I am new to package.json 
[19:54] cagdas: now I learned the syntax for "latest" :)

[19:55] cagdas: ok, another topic
[19:55] cagdas: anyone working on writing a nodejs client for ROS
[19:55] cagdas: ?
[19:55] megalomix: then how can i close it ? how can i kill it? because i tried to kill the master but the childs are still running
[19:55] vdemedes: cagdas: ROS?
[19:55] cagdas: ros.org
[19:55] vdemedes: megalomix: killall node
[19:56] idefine has joined the channel
[19:56] vdemedes: megalomix: or you can: sudo lsof -i :<PORT> && kill <PID1> <PID2> <PID3>
[19:56] AndreasMadsen: megalomix: listen on process.on('SIGTERM') and execute workers.forEach(function (worker) { worker.kill() }) followed by process.exit(0)
[19:56] gr4yscale has joined the channel
[19:56] AndreasMadsen: megalomix: this way you relay SIGTERM to the workers
[19:57] megalomix: ah perfect!
[19:57] megalomix: thanks
[19:57] AndreasMadsen: megalomix: you could also listen on process.on('exit')
[19:57] vdemedes: AndreasMadsen: good suggestion! Did not think about it!
[19:57] hkjels has joined the channel
[19:58] megalomix: is this wrong? $NODE_ENV=production node server.js ???
[19:58] AndreasMadsen: vdemedes: I have done extensive cluster work, and a similar will be in node v0.7.
[19:58] megalomix: i get: =production: command not found   ï¿½_ï¿½
[19:58] jldbasa has joined the channel
[19:58] vdemedes: megalomix: should be: NODE_ENV=production node server.js
[19:58] RLa: use NODE_ENV without $
[19:58] vdemedes: without $
[19:59] megalomix: ooh right!!! 
[19:59] megalomix: thanks :)

[20:01] mmalecki: how can I get heap snapshot of a running process without using node-inspector?

[20:30] sigurding: vdemedes: I was wondering if there is an option to separate the HTML files from the actual source code: so essentially something like this res.end(renderFile("uploadForm.html");
[20:30] vdemedes: of course
[20:30] vdemedes: sigurding: if you are using Express, read about Views at http://expressjs.com
[20:30] vdemedes: sigurding: the principle is: fs.readFile + res.write
[20:31] maxogden: require('filed')('uploadForm.html').pipe(res)
[20:31] vdemedes: maxogden: what about variables, that he needs to pass to that view?
[20:31] sigurding: ah great, I will take look
[20:32] vdemedes: sigurding: and you will probably want to use template engines. I recommend Handlebars. Take a look on list of template engines at: http://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Modules
[20:32] sigurding: know it from sammy.js :)
[20:32] sigurding: so for vars I could take partials

[20:33] vdemedes: sigurding: If I'm not mistaking, there are some performance troubles + bugs appear when using partials in Handlebars.js

[22:29] panosru: hi, how do you create breadcrumbs with express? Do you use any ready-made module or you have your custom way?

[22:32] mAritz: Dmitriju1: What is the topic supposed to mean anyways?
[22:32] mAritz: panosru: there's no built-in rest api in express, so express wouldn't even know what your breadcrumbs are

[22:33] zomg: mAritz: in case you haven't noticed yet, this channel has kind of random topics :P
[22:33] panosru: mAritz: so how you deal with breadcrumb ? I mean you end-up on custom solution some-how?
[22:33] zomg: looks like it is trying to say http://nodejs.org though =)
[22:34] zomg: panosru: that would entirely depend on how your application is structured
[22:34] izepstan has joined the channel
[22:34] mAritz: panosru: personally i do it on the client, because i work on SPAs :)
[22:35] panosru: zomg: there are so many npm modules that I though there could be something specific for that purpose (I'm looking something to have the functionality of Zend_Helper_Navigation )

[22:35] panosru: mAritz: you mean you build your navigation menu & breadcrumb on the client ?
[22:35] philipd has joined the channel
[22:38] zomg: panosru: well you would first need to have some builtin way to get an mvc structure, express doesn't provide anything for that, just the base
[22:38] janekp has joined the channel
[22:38] Illourr| has joined the channel
[22:38] zomg: Your best bet would probably to see if you can find some node mvc package, perhaps they might have that
[22:38] panosru: zomg: yes that's true
[22:39] mAritz: panosru: yeah, no other way in my architecture. basically my server serves js files and has a REST json api. all presentation logic is on the client :)
[22:39] methodt has joined the channel
[22:39] panosru: zomg: I don't need any mvc package, I follow DDD/CQRS architecture with internal MVC structure per domain
[22:39] zomg: mAritz: what's an SPA anyways?
[22:39] mAritz: single page app
[22:39] zomg: Ah of course =)

[22:40] mAritz: panosru: i guess your breadcrumbs rely on the url?! it should be failry trivial to create a middleware that does it for your specific needs. maybe even use a dynamic view helper, if you use views.
[22:40] joshkehn has joined the channel
[22:40] panosru: zomg: when I said if there is any already made navigation/breadcrumb module I wanted to check out how they deal by keeping parent/child + depth functionality, if there is any best practice way or something :)

[22:43] panosru: mAritz: I use express-resource module in order to create resource/routes, what I want to find out is if I have a resource to be able to check the parents of that resource, since you can have parentResource.add(childResource.add(child2Resource ... etc so i want to be able to get the parents tree in order to build the breadcrumb, which still won't be that simple as it sounds
[22:44] toothr has joined the channel
[22:45] panosru: mAritz: for now, as the quickest way would be to have block breadcrumb in my main jade layout, and for each child template that extends parents instead of re-define the block breadcrumb to use append breadcrumb and build the breadcrumb through template
[22:46] panosru: this could be a possible solution, not dynamic though because if you modify a resource/route you need to modify your template too, but still it could work :)

[23:37] bbenvie: I can make them work by ending every debug run with something like
[23:37] diverdude: bbenvie: random builds?
[23:37] tristanz: is node 64 or 32 bit on osx by default?  how can I tell?
[23:37] bbenvie: process.neckTick(function(){ process.end() }) to make sure it still outputs whatever i'm logging first
[23:37] bbenvie: yeah sometimes when I've built it and I think some official ones
[23:38] bbenvie: it seems random but I haven't paid attention
[23:38] bbenvie: I just switch to another version or build
[23:38] diverdude: anybody managed to config haproxy for websockets (socket.io)?
[23:39] larsschenk has joined the channel
[23:39] illourr: diverdude: the terminal was built into sublime and ctrl+c just did copy... and i couldnt find a way to quit the terminal so i quit the editor and the server is still running haha
[23:40] diverdude: illourr: find the process id
[23:40] illourr: i found the processes running in my windows task manager..
[23:40] diverdude: and kill it
[23:40] illourr: stupid sublime
[23:40] diverdude: illourr: ps aux | grep processname
[23:41] illourr: i did , cmd: taskkill /im node.exe /f

[23:55] killing-joke: how many unique page views per day equals one user? different for every site?
[23:56] zomg: Huh? o_O
[23:57] killing-joke: if a person visits, loads five pages, leaves, and comes back to do that twice more in the day, we have 15 views.
[23:57] killing-joke: and perhaps three "uniques".  one person.

[23:58] killing-joke: so measurement of "users" in that sense is opinion.
[23:58] eamonnw has left the channel
[23:59] zomg: Yeah if you're not tracking actual signups or other actions which would make a visitor a user (eg. maybe you have an upload service so a vistor would implicitly become a user when they upload)
