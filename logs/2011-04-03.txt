[00:05] NuckingFuts: Ugh Greasemonkey is a bitch
[00:08] jesusabdullah: Is it?
[00:08] jesusabdullah: I made a greasemonkey script once, but it was like 8 years ago, and I didn't actually know any javascript
[00:08] jesusabdullah: You could use it to get rid of the all-lowercase CSS on hackaday.com
[00:09] NuckingFuts: jesusabdullah: They have a cross-origin XHR, but it's broken with a nonsensical reason now.
[00:09] boaz has joined the channel
[00:09] NuckingFuts: It dies silently
[00:09] NuckingFuts: And I need it.
[00:09] jesusabdullah: Oh?
[00:09] jesusabdullah: Huh
[00:09] jesusabdullah: What for?
[00:09] jesusabdullah: Also, that sounds lame
[00:09] NuckingFuts: Their testcase has alert()before it, and it dies, somebody removed that, and it worked :|
[00:09] jesusabdullah: Weird o__o
[00:10] jesusabdullah: I should read about greasemonkey again, cause i just realized
[00:10] jesusabdullah: I don't know what GM really does that bookmarklets don't
[00:10] NuckingFuts: https://github.com/greasemonkey/greasemonkey/issues#issue/1318
[00:10] NuckingFuts: jesusabdullah: Lots.  No more clicking, too
[00:10] jesusabdullah: *nod*
[00:11] NuckingFuts: It can do cross-origin XHR, and before there was localStorage, there was GM_setValue and GM_getValue
[00:11] NuckingFuts: Plus it's all sandboxed separate from the page :P

[00:12] jesusabdullah: ah
[00:12] jesusabdullah: That's kinda cool
[00:12] jesusabdullah: I thought it'd be cool to do some of that stuff via a proxy server
[00:12] Aikar: its basically the power of firefox addons, but 1000x easier to write
[00:12] jesusabdullah: but I never got around to playing with it
[00:12] NuckingFuts: I've been writing GM scripts for a few years now, but my lack of fluency had always caused my scripts to be instable
[00:12] Aikar: GM scripts can actually be converted into FF addons so they dont need GM to run

[00:15] ckknight: jscheel: how are you storing session data?
[00:15] jscheel: ckknight: connect's session middleware
[00:15] jscheel: in express
[00:16] jscheel: res.session.user = ...
[00:17] fljitovak has joined the channel
[00:19] ckknight: yep, serializes as JSON by the store.
[00:19] ckknight: so the code of https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/master/lib/middleware/session.js leads me to believe
[00:20] fermion has joined the channel
[00:20] jscheel: ckknight: I just read an interesting idea for preserving functions in json: http://solutoire.com/2008/06/12/sending-javascript-functions-over-json/
[00:21] ckknight: it's generally a bad idea
[00:21] ckknight: safety is an important concern if you do anything crazy like that.
[00:22] ckknight: there's a damn good reason why JSON doesn't include function support.
[00:22] Aikar: anyone whos played in the V8 land know how to get the ObjectTemplate from an Object?
[00:22] jscheel: ckknight: true, but think about the benefits. For example, right now, I can't store a user object in a session, so at each request, I have to re-create a new user object with all of the parameters
[00:22] ckknight: ...good
[00:22] ckknight: you should be either storing Users in a cache or hydrating them each time
[00:23] Aikar: jscheel: write the "User Object Class" on both ends, and initiate a new one and fill in the properties received over JSON
[00:23] ckknight: Aikar: you want the ObjectTemplate C-side or JS-side?
[00:24] davidascher has joined the channel
[00:25] jscheel: ckknight: Aikar: cool, I'll hydrate at each request. Thanks!
[00:26] jscheel: I already created a factory method for the users, so it's trivial anyways :P
[00:26] ckknight: huzzah, then
[00:26] tokumine_ has joined the channel
[00:27] ckknight: the generally appropriate way that I tend to do something like that is by having two ways to create the model, one which has full validation and such that you'd use when creating it from scratch or from untrusted data, and one which just takes some blob of data (which in JavaScript would probably be an Object coming from a memory store or redis or something) which very quickly just copies properties over.

[00:41] ckknight: out of my territory, haven't played in the C land of node yet
[00:41] Aikar: i was gonna let the user specify which object to set it on but looks like ima have to make one and return it
[00:41] oplaque has joined the channel
[00:41] Aikar: im trying to make a "magic method" module, the feature looks like its there on C++ side with Interceptors, dunno why thats not exposed to JS Land
[00:42] Aikar: ie a global getter/setter for an object
[00:43] carllerche has joined the channel
[00:44] ckknight: Aikar: so that accessing a global property goes through a function first?
[00:45] Aikar: yea
[00:45] Aikar: so obj.foo triggers a getter for function('foo');
[00:45] Aikar: like phps __get and __set and essentially __call
[00:45] ckknight: oh, that's different
[00:45] ckknight: I thought you meant just accessing something on the global scope
[00:45] ckknight: I'll be glad when Proxy becomes available for V8
[00:46] ckknight: it's part of the ECMAScript 5.1 spec
[00:46] ckknight: and Firefox 4 supports it

[01:39] gundas: Hello all. I"m new to node.js and I have created a simple application that displays results from a CouchDb database and it works perfectly. What I would like to do is have node.js automatically update when a new entry is added - is that where I use setTimeout() or is there another way with node.js?
[01:40] ncb000gt: gundas: which couchdb driver are you using?
[01:41] gundas: ncb000gt:cradle
[01:41] MuzzleFork has joined the channel
[01:41] ncb000gt: gundas: take a look at the changes api here https://github.com/cloudhead/cradle
[01:42] mscdex: got a basic/rudimentary web ui for youknow \o/
[01:42] ckknight: mscdex: I don't kno
[01:42] ckknight: know*
[01:42] mscdex: hehe
[01:42] gundas: ncb000gt: Ah ok cool, I was reading into this. Is this something I should push back to couchdb?
[01:43] mscdex: youknow is an uno clone i wrote
[01:43] ckknight: ooh, fun
[01:43] mscdex: players can play via the web or from irc
[01:43] mscdex: :)
[01:43] gundas: ncb000gt: The problem is I'm querying a view not a list of documents
[01:43] ncb000gt: gundas: you can talk to those  involved with couchdb to see if they are interested
[01:43] mscdex: it's realtime multiplayer
[01:44] gundas: ncb000gt: Are you aware if mongodb supports something similar?
[01:44] ncb000gt: gundas: well, knowing if there is a new document in the view, i suspect, wont work, so you could use the changes stream to know if there is new data
[01:44] ncb000gt: nah, i have no idea
[01:44] mscdex: but i suck at writing spiffy web user interfaces :P
[01:44] gundas: ncb000gt: But I guess the alternative is to just use setTimeout ?
[01:44] draginx: When will nodejs become awesome for extensive CPU work? :(
[01:45] ncb000gt: gundas: yes, you can do polling
[01:45] mscdex: draginx: webworkers!
[01:45] ncb000gt: which would use setTimeout
[01:45] draginx: mscdex: eh?
[01:45] gundas: ncb000gt: Ok, I just had the impression that node.js would do things magically :)
[01:45] draginx: gundas: u can use socket.IO for new updates as well O-o
[01:45] ncb000gt: or setInterval
[01:45] mscdex: draginx: you can spin up child workers to do cpu intensive stuff
[01:45] draginx: and may be if couchdb has sub/pub options?
[01:45] draginx: mscdex: meh I guess, I'm tlaking about video encoding xD
[01:45] ncb000gt: gundas: weeeeeellllll, unicorns and rainbows...but besides that, it does take a bit more code
[01:45] ncb000gt: ;D
[01:45] gundas: ncb000gt: damn!
[01:46] mscdex: draginx: so create a child process for ffmpeg? :P

[01:48] gundas: ncb000gt: One part of my app uses a node.js script to grab data from twitter's streming api and dump it into node.js and the other is to display that data. Would I be right in assuming it would be "best practice" to have the first part running as a bg task and the app sitting separately?
[01:49] ncb000gt: gundas: depends on how much load you're seeing. it makes sense to me to do so since you likely don't want to be storing that data in memory
[01:49] ncb000gt: so yes. i'd say that the way you have it set up now is fine.
[01:49] gundas: ncb000gt: cool
[01:50] gundas: ncb000gt: its for campaigns which run for 1 - 2 hours once a week

[02:00] darshanshankar has joined the channel
[02:00] ncb000gt: basically you'd send a message to the client through websockets
[02:01] ncb000gt: otherwise you need to make the client poll the server for "more data"
[02:01] ncb000gt: and you'd have to store the changes in memory until requested
[02:01] doubletap1 has left the channel
[02:01] ncb000gt: additionally, websockets will give you a much more realtime feel with the changes data
[02:01] Gotham: Yes postgres! Take a look at my modification: http://pastebin.com/FwuPFX7R
[02:02] ncb000gt: even though it's not exactly realtime due to the setTimeout
[02:02] Gotham: ^ This is my mdofication to /usr/local/lib/node/.npm/pg/0.3.2/package/lib/types.js (just one line)
[02:02] dguttman has joined the channel
[02:02] Gotham: It stops brainc's array parser from barfing on '{}' as a value
[02:03] gundas: ncb000gt: so dump express, just have a node.js script and html ?
[02:03] Gotham: (Which was making my app crash and my employer mad)
[02:03] ncb000gt: gundas: nah, you can use both
[02:03] ncb000gt: you'd still need to render a webpage of sorts
[02:03] gundas: ncb000gt: ah ok
[02:03] ncb000gt: that page would have the client based socket.io library
[02:04] ncb000gt: and it would make a connection to the socket.io server through http
[02:04] ncb000gt: erm, websockets
[02:04] Croms has joined the channel
[02:04] ncb000gt: and then, you can communicate through an open channel
[02:05] gundas: ncb000gt: ah
[02:05] ncb000gt: so your setTimeout function would be something akin to function() { db.getData(view, function(err, data) { socket.broadcast(data); })}
[02:06] ncb000gt: obviously it'd have to be different, but it's more code than will fit in here
[02:06] Gotham: Is brianc going to fix his pg module now for postgresql? I need it patched for my company
[02:06] gundas: ncb000gt: any good tutorials on socketio you can recommend?
[02:06] Gotham: Otherwise when we deploy to servers, we will have brainc's version of the module with the bug
[02:06] ncb000gt: gundas: not sure, i'll check a few places
[02:07] gundas: ncb000gt: cool thanks
[02:07] ncb000gt: gundas: alternatively, you could take a look at nowjs
[02:07] ncb000gt: it wraps up some of the complexity
[02:07] ncb000gt: of websockets

[02:13] ncb000gt: :)
[02:13] gundas: ncb000gt: what are the advantages of doing this with node.js over say having a ruby script which queries the db and have a html script with jquery which just polls the ruby script every 5 seconds?
[02:13] classyfy: :// Yeah I need a client
[02:13] classyfy: ncb000gt: Thanks anyway though
[02:13] zerl has joined the channel
[02:13] \sega has joined the channel
[02:14] mscdex: classyfy: i'm curious, why are you needing an ssh client in node?
[02:15] classyfy: mscdex: I want to build something to the effect of remote control of UNIX/Mac computers via WebOS Phones just based on SSH interfacing with SSHd on the host, so you'd install this client and then you could log off users, shut down your comp, log out users, kill applications, all with the ease of a click of a button. No server to install

[02:15] classyfy: mscdex: Node.js is built into webos2+
[02:16] ngs has joined the channel
[02:17] ncb000gt: gundas: i'm not sure that websocket libraries exist yet for ruby, i'd find it unlikely but possible that they don't. the advantages of websockets is realtime data and less setup/teardown of tcp requests.
[02:17] ncb000gt: gundas: none-of-which you really have to deal with, but still, a consideration
[02:17] ncb000gt: but realistically, use what you are comfortable with and prefer
[02:18] gundas: ncb000gt: I'm trying to achieve as real time data as I can
[02:18] ncb000gt: sure
[02:18] gundas: ncb000gt: I think this is the best method long term
[02:18] zerl has left the channel
[02:19] ncb000gt: then yea, i'd go with it and seriously consider using the changes api as a catalyst to request data from the view in couch.
[02:19] ncb000gt: once you get data you can then push that the the client with websockets (either through dnode or nowjs) and achieve pretty close to realtime
[02:21] gundas: ncb000gt: http://till.klampaeckel.de/blog/archives/133-node.js-socket.io-fun.html looks like a good tutorial which includes a db
[02:22] ncb000gt: lol
[02:22] ncb000gt: that's exactly the approach i was suggesting :)

[02:59] ncb000gt: heh
[02:59] samcday: Yeah I've had my fair share of segfaults.
[02:59] samcday: Jesus.
[02:59] ncb000gt: yep
[02:59] ncb000gt: i reworked a lot of the bcrypt module the other day
[03:00] ncb000gt: lots of segfaults
[03:00] samcday: The most fun I've ever had.... I had to extend gitteh to allow ref packing (which invalidates ALL other opened ref ptrs). Which would be fine if I wasn't caching the poitnetrs
[03:00] ncb000gt: hahahaha
[03:00] samcday: I had to write this convoluted system that uses 3 different mutexes
[03:00] samcday: To be able to update any opened references
[03:00] samcday: Without breaking shit >_<
[03:00] ncb000gt: yea
[03:01] ncb000gt: def more complicated than the stuff i'm doing
[03:01] ncb000gt: although this random one might be up there
[03:01] ncb000gt: ...
[03:01] ncb000gt: not sure why or where and I can only sometimes replicate it
[03:02] samcday: You using gdb + node_g?

[03:02] samcday: Stack traces on segfaults = omgyespls
[03:02] ncb000gt: not node_g
[03:02] ncb000gt: but gdb for sure
[03:02] ncb000gt: hmm
[03:02] samcday: node_g is better if you get it running, since you can see if the segfault is happening somewhere in V8
[03:03] samcday: Which *can* happen if you're doing silly shit with Handles for example.
[03:03] samcday: Or if you're doing something bad when v8 is running weakref callbacks
[03:03] ncb000gt: yea, that's nice
[03:03] ncb000gt: however, i just ran it and it ran clean

[03:03] samcday: do something risky like 1000 times in a loop
[03:03] ncb000gt: aye
[03:03] samcday: even then the segfaults didn't always happen haha - 'cos gdb runs things slower

[03:55] skm has joined the channel
[03:55] shaunau: i havent used it in any meaningful way.. but i've been thinking about dynamic collections rather than static.. havent seen much talk about that approach
[03:57] shaunau: By that i mean using the creation of collections at runtime to store stuff per group/user/company kinda deal
[03:58] shaunau: most people seem to try to port over the RDMS Entity type schema rather than say storing "Files"+_companyId as a collection itself.
[04:00] shaunau: tried to discuss on #mongodb last night but responses where not very open to discussion
[04:00] shaunau: basically i was a witch and should be burnt..
[04:01] ncb000gt: well...do you weigh the same as a duck?
[04:01] shaunau: erm.. a really big duck..
[04:01] ncb000gt: A WITCH!

[04:02] gazumps856 has joined the channel
[04:03] ParadoxQuine: hm  so
[04:04] ParadoxQuine: are you trying to then have it make collections say, per user, and inside that could be the user's preferences, maybe some personal data, etc. rather than storing all that in a collection of all the users info with lots of nesting in the docs? am i interpreting that right?
[04:05] vipaca has joined the channel
[04:05] vipaca has joined the channel
[04:06] blkcat has joined the channel
[04:06] shaunau: not so much mixing all that stuff into one lump.. more like Messages_"+groupId (would contain all the messages for a group) rather than just Messages containing all messages for all groups
[04:07] userbound has joined the channel
[04:08] shaunau: my aapp will generate millions of messages a year and i'm concerned about the scan of that many records to pull stuff out for a group. one group will never interact with another groups messages
[04:08] shaunau: tens of millions of messages a year
[04:09] shaunau: i guess i'm trying to think of the NOSQL document store as a "document store" rather than an Entity based system.
[04:11] shaunau: i can see some potential problems, like greater than 10k groups could become a problem :) but if that happens i'll be sitting on a beach in Thailand drinking cocktails and paying someone to scale the system futher :)
[04:11] shaunau: so i'm not too fussed about that right now. :)
[04:12] ckknight: pretty good plan, playing tourist in Thailand is generally pretty cheap.
[04:13] shaunau: well, with 10k groups paying a monthly subscription i'd be flying in my private helicopter :P

[04:14] timcosgrove has left the channel
[04:17] alex_b has joined the channel
[04:25] ParadoxQuine: ok so i thought correctly
[04:25] ParadoxQuine: rather than storing it in one huge thing
[04:25] ParadoxQuine: you want to break it up by collections
[04:25] ParadoxQuine: which seems TOTALLY logical to me
[04:26] ParadoxQuine: since you said you never need to query multiple collections at once
[04:26] ParadoxQuine: not sure why the mongo guys were up in arms against that
[04:26] shaunau: yeah thats it. its basically private sets of data (of the same type of record)
[04:27] ParadoxQuine: if that's not a good use for collections i don't know what is
[04:27] shaunau: it was just one or two users who seemed to think it was madness
[04:27] ParadoxQuine: ok
[04:27] dnolen has joined the channel
[04:27] ParadoxQuine: i mean, the only problem i see there is mongo scaling to tens of thousands of collections......which it should do just fine
[04:27] shaunau: i got the feeling that they knew less than they made out.
[04:27] ParadoxQuine: haha could be
[04:27] ParadoxQuine: i'm currently doing a similar thing
[04:28] ParadoxQuine: i'm writing an assignment front-end for students with a backend for professors for some courses at my school
[04:28] ParadoxQuine: and each course has it's own collection
[04:28] ParadoxQuine: *its
[04:28] shaunau: agreed about the tens of thousands of collections, i think it'll handle 10k diff collections without any trouble. but it depends on indexing too.
[04:28] shaunau: ahh good.
[04:29] shaunau: yep that's quite similar
[04:30] fairwinds has joined the channel
[04:30] shaunau: i was thinking if the number of collections got too big for one mongo db i'd just more databases and an index to point to the db with the relevant collection :/
[04:30] ParadoxQuine: yup
[04:31] shaunau: also means if you wanna delete or move a "group" its a no brainer.
[04:31] shaunau: no need to cherry pick from one set.
[04:32] ParadoxQuine: ya
[04:32] shaunau: ok. well i'm glad you're doing the same thing, means i'm not totally crazy.
[04:32] ParadoxQuine: or we both are :P
[04:32] shaunau: :)
[04:32] ParadoxQuine: though i've read over the mongo docs pretty thoroughly and that seems to be to be exactly what collections are good for

[09:22] eb4890 has joined the channel
[09:22] V1: There are variouse of big implementations.. I know royal bank of scotland, github, cloud9ide, joyent, sony are using node.js
[09:23] V1: But I can name about 30 more big companies running node
[09:23] konobi: ajsie: try changing the "success" value, to a getter instead
[09:24] johannds: cool. thanks.  
[09:25] johannds: I've been waiting for something like Node for ages...  For the past 5 years I've been a passionate believer in ultra-lightweight back-end systems with javascript intensive front-ends
[09:25] johannds: from my experience this approach works very well.
[09:25] johannds: specially for line of business applications that can run on the web.
[09:26] konobi: github use it for their downloads system
[09:26] konobi: far far better than what they had before too
[09:26] johannds: the advent of tablet PCs with good web capabilities has just fueled my argument for less bulk in the back-end and more use of the browser.
[09:28] mscdex: ajsie: the problem is it should be "writable" not "writeable"

[10:03] Associat0r has joined the channel
[10:04] jetienne: v8bot: 1+1
[10:04] v8bot: jetienne: Use v8: <code> to evaluate code or "`v commands" for a list of v8bot commands.
[10:04] samcday: `v is easier though
[10:04] v8bot: samcday: No such command.
[10:04] jetienne: samcday: you dont use tab completion when you irc ?
[10:05] samcday: Not really. Never been an IRC person actually.
[10:05] samcday: My question is - why does it matter?
[10:05] jetienne: to put the name of the nick you talk to is common practice on irc
[10:05] samcday: v8bot isn't a person though.
[10:05] jetienne: it is a nick
[10:05] jetienne: samcday: i can do the patch if it is open source
[10:05] chapel: makes it easier
[10:06] chapel: I mean I know to use v8: so its not an issue
[10:06] sep0: hey guys, i have written a cmd for the browser to execute functions on a runinng node server, if i try to dump complex objects the server exits with the error "converting circular structure to JSON" , how can i also log these objects?
[10:06] jetienne: chapel: this is it. you need to know. with v8bot you dont need to know
[10:06] chapel: but it would save people having to retry if it just worked as expected
[10:06] samcday: I still don't understand why `v is a problem. it works, so who cares.
[10:07] samcday: Also, `v is two keystrokes
[10:07] chapel: eh `v is not easy
[10:07] samcday: Whereas if there's more than 1 nick that starts with v
[10:07] samcday: I have to type more than 2 keystrokes ...
[10:07] chapel: samcday: for me v8bot = v + tab
[10:07] chapel: done
[10:07] jetienne: samcday: the point is just using the normal usual irc mechanism
[10:07] samcday: ?
[10:07] samcday: I type v + tab
[10:07] samcday: And I get "V1 v8bot Validatorian varioust Vertice viirya vilhonen_ Viper-7 Virtuo voodootikigod vuliev "
[10:07] chapel: using `v is counterintuitive
[10:08] chapel: depends on your client
[10:08] jetienne: samcday: on irc to talk to a nick, you put its nickname before
[10:08] chapel: I use Linkinus
[10:08] Associat0r has left the channel
[10:08] samcday: jetienne, I'm aware of this./
[10:08] jetienne: samcday: im just trying to make it easier to use by using the usual mechanism
[10:08] samcday: chapel, Perhaps Linkinus is smart and only tab completes active nicks.
[10:08] chapel: it does
[10:08] chapel: the last active nick is the one it completes
[10:08] samcday: Well I'm on Windoze - using XChat
[10:09] jetienne: samcday: is v8bot opensoure ? im ok to do the patch

[10:15] jetienne: samcday: the package is in npm db for sure. im guessing it is just the search db is not yet updated
[10:16] samcday: I published gitteh about a month ago though
[10:16] jetienne: ah :)
[10:16] jetienne: i may be wrong then
[10:16] samcday: Guess I'll bug isaacs about it later
[10:16] samcday: Might be 'cos I unpublished it a couple of weeks ago then immediately republished (made a retard mistake :P)
[10:16] chapel: normanx: it really isn't a node.js competitor, it doesn't use javascript
[10:18] chapel: ryah: what was that gist for?
[10:18] normanx: chapel: you can make it output javascript

[10:28] tmzt_: mongoose is simple
[10:29] jetienne: is there a pure javascript implementation of bson around ?
[10:30] shachaf: jetienne: Binary parsing in JavaScript is somewhat tricky and usually not all that efficient.
[10:30] jetienne: shachaf: what do you mean not that efficient ?
[10:31] jetienne: shachaf: im passing json object in string at the moment... and this is super inefficient :)
[10:31] jetienne: '{ x: -145.69199371596332, y: -36.73271482839295 }' <- i pass this kind of data in websocket... to send that as string is very inefficient
[10:31] shachaf: Space-inefficient, yes. :-)
[10:32] joshbaptiste has joined the channel
[10:32] jetienne: so how bson is inefficient ? i never tried it
[10:32] normanx: chapel: http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/talk-by-adam-granicz client side F#
[10:32] stagas: jetienne: use .toFixed() ?
[10:33] samcday: imo, binary packing isn't that inefficient, if you reuse your buffers 
[10:33] chapel: not saying f# isn't a viable option, the big issue is its not well known
[10:33] samcday: Allocating buffers is expensive, but working with them isn't so bad, and it's only going to get better with the new crankshaft optimizations.
[10:33] shachaf: stagas: Presumably jetienne wants the precision.
[10:33] jetienne: stagas: yuk... to destroy my data just because of a bad standard ? no way :)
[10:33] normanx: chapel: true
[10:33] shachaf: samcday: Buffers?

[10:36] fly-away has joined the channel
[10:36] jetienne: i need standard + small output

[10:39] drizzd_: hi. I'd like to combine a websocket server with a regular webserver (e.g. apache), but I want to use only port 80. Is that possible?
[10:39] Charuru: no
[10:40] stagas: jetienne: then parseInt(s, 36) / 100 to get it back. for more precision just change the toFixed and the multiplier/divider
[10:40] Charuru: only 1 server can use a port at the same time
[10:40] Charuru: you can proxy one server THROUGH another though
[10:40] jetienne: stagas: i got it on the first msg :)
[10:40] saschagehlich has joined the channel
[10:40] jetienne: stagas: btw where are you with your soccer ?
[10:41] drizzd_: Charuru: could I forward websocket requests using an apache websocket handler, like pywebsocket, for example?
[10:41] stagas: jetienne: don't have time now :)
[10:41] Charuru: no idea, but drizzd_ why must your websocket server be on 80?
[10:42] drizzd_: because other ports are blocked
[10:42] stagas: jetienne: I want to make a goalkeeper
[10:42] tmzt_: drizzd_: how is pywebsocket an apache websocket handler?

[10:46] dve: i have written my little app in coffeescript (inc several modules also in CS) how can I launch my main app.coffee from a js file? i am hosting on no.de and it requires sever.js to be the main file
[10:46] drizzd_: Charuru: ok, I'll look into proxying. It just seems strange to me that there is no simple solution. Was it not one of the goals of the websocket protocol to integrate with regular http requests?

[11:30] Sbioko: url.txt = 'a', fs.writeFileSync('url.txt', 'b', 'utf8') inserts into url.txt = 'a/u000b'. More shorter description of my problem

[11:33] Croms: Why not use fs.createWriteStream instead?
[11:33] Sbioko: Croms: I need synchronous write
[11:34] Croms: Acoording to API, "writes data to a file, replacing the file if it already exists".
[11:34] Croms: According*
[11:35] Sbioko: and?
[11:35] Croms: It's fine I guess, if that's what you're after.
[11:41] Croms: Works here.
[11:44] tmzt_: okay this is crazy, with a mongoose Model, Model.findOne({ownerid: "objectid"}) returns null, find() returns []
[11:44] Sbioko: problem solved
[11:45] Sbioko: I just needed to trim the string
[11:45] Sbioko: tmzt_: did you specify callback?
[11:45] tmzt_: you had a \0?
[11:45] tmzt_: Sbioko: yes
[11:45] tmzt_: Remix.find({ownerid: user_id, function(err, doc) {
[11:45] tmzt_: 				console.log('err: ', err);
[11:45] tmzt_: 				res.send(doc);
[11:45] tmzt_: 			});
[11:45] tmzt_: oh, missed |
[11:45] Sbioko: because findOne needs to find one object, and it returns null if it does not exist
[11:45] tmzt_: }
[11:46] Sbioko: find search for multiple objects, and returns [] (empty array) if there are no data
[11:46] Sbioko: logical
[11:46] tmzt_: right, I"m just testing it
[11:46] tmzt_: but the data is there
[11:46] tmzt_: it's not getting it
[11:46] Sbioko: then check your model definitions and conditions
[11:46] tmzt_: console works fine, I can't find an example
[11:46] Sbioko: try to do the same thing in mongo console
[11:46] tmzt_: ownerid: ObjectId
[11:47] tmzt_: it works in mongo
[11:48] tmzt_: I get it
[11:48] tmzt_: it was saving a string in ownerid

[11:54] ironmagma: I hope that's not really the case :P

[11:55] Bonuspunkt: its the easiest thing to get node running
[11:56] stride: the native version is still work in progress, right?
[11:56] ironmagma: I guess I can see the want for that isWindows property, which they so conveniently removed
[11:58] tmzt_: so the real problem I'm having is mongoose doesn't seem to recognize a syntax for specifying a string as ObjectId
[11:59] stride: ryah: haha, how awesome is that? :) (@ your google results tweet)
[12:02] Ian_: maybe a stupid question: how does one go about including one file in another file? If i use require, nothing really happens

[14:21] Max-Might has left the channel
[14:21] Aikar: you could make a config loader where config.foo.bar.baz loads foo.json if its not cached and reads bar.baz from it andr eturns it (sync of course or else youll need to use cb)
[14:22] Aikar: repeating message from last night: https://github.com/aikar/magic  my first "released" lib :D. Lets you do global getter/setters like PHP's __get and __set

[14:47] Micfire has joined the channel
[14:47] Micfire: Hey.. anybody here using riak-js?
[14:47] Aikar: so the return _magic(); in the getter can be replaced with return this;
[14:48] Aikar: i also ran it with 500k iterations creating magic objects and no memory leak was seen.
[14:49] dominictarr has joined the channel
[14:50] dominictarr has joined the channel
[14:50] Aikar: i ran into 1 bug i had to fix (fixed before it was released!) in that node.js on console.log checks for an 'inspect' property to call. so it was firing the getter anytime you did a console.log on it (although you really dont have much need to ever print it since itll ALWAYS be {})
[14:50] Aikar: but i added a check in the getter to see if its console.log calling it and not fire getter
[14:53] stride: doesn't that slow things down pretty much to cover such a rare case?
[14:53] Aikar: just a simple comparison
[14:53] Aikar: nothing 'slow' about the operation
[14:54] Aikar: if (!(name == 'inspect' && arguments.callee.caller.caller === util.inspect)) {
[14:54] Aikar: hmm, irssi was smart... that was 2 lines of code haha
[14:54] Aikar: and it put it as 1
[14:56] Charuru: anyone ere use dotcloud?

[14:57] Micfire: Hmm.. anybody know Coffeescript around here?
[14:57] ckknight: Aikar: seems like you'd want it to call inspect, if you ask me
[14:57] ckknight: Micfire: yeah, I do
[14:57] Aikar: ckknight: i dont provide an inspect nor does it have anything special to inspect :P
[14:57] Micfire: https://github.com/frank06/riak-js/blob/master/src/http_client.coffee .. am I reading this right that sending {host:'1.1.1.1'} as options should work here?
[14:57] no-gooder has joined the channel
[14:57] Micfire: riak-js is giving me a headache :/
[14:58] Aikar: and that code is simply preventing the users CB from firing on it
[14:58] ckknight: Micfire: yeah, it'll access options.port and options.host
[14:58] Aikar: if i added an inspect i could add } else { return myInspect; }
[14:58] Micfire: ckknight: yeah, that's what I thought too.. but it doesn't seem to work :/
[14:58] ckknight: Micfire: what you could do if you wanted was compile it to javascript and read it that way
[15:00] Micfire: I have to say that Coffeescript is a great idea but it has a bad timing.. js is just starting to emerge and people are still figuring out how to write good async code.. last thing we need right now is coffeescript to change the syntax :D
[15:01] stephank has joined the channel
[15:03] ckknight: Micfire: since coffeescript compiles to javascript, it really doesn't matter, you can always just look at the compiled javascript to understand it.

[15:09] hvgotcodes: which module allows node.js to interact with the command line?
[15:09] Micfire: isn't it builtin in the core?
[15:10] Aikar: hvgotcodes: just type node w/o any args
[15:10] Aikar: or write blah.js with this line at the top:
[15:10] Aikar: #!/usr/bin/env node
[15:10] Aikar: then write js code in that file
[15:10] Aikar: and then chmod ugo+x blah.js
[15:10] hvgotcodes: Aikar: i want to write a node program but have access to all the bash programs
[15:10] Micfire: do you mean reading args or using cli from js? :)
[15:10] Yuffster has joined the channel
[15:10] Aikar: then you can put that file in a /usr/bin folder or so
[15:10] hvgotcodes: Micfire: both
[15:11] Aikar: hvgotcodes: look at child_process.exec
[15:11] Aikar: that lets you execute other programs quickly
[15:11] Micfire: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.5/api/process.html#process.argv .. here's for args
[15:11] hvgotcodes: basically i could do this all with a bash shell, but want to write a node program just because
[15:11] Aikar: exec=require('child_process').exec;  exec('cat /etc/passwd', function(err, stdin, stdout, stderr) { /** foo **/ });
[15:11] torgeir has joined the channel
[15:11] hvgotcodes: now will the node process block until child_process returns?
[15:12] rootslab has joined the channel
[15:12] dahankzter has joined the channel
[15:12] Aikar: no you have to use callbacks, welcome to async programming :)
[15:12] ckknight: it won't block, things don't block by design.
[15:12] Micfire: I think there's only few things in Node that block.. require was at least one
[15:13] Aikar: require and the few explicit fs calls that end in in Sync
[15:13] hvgotcodes: on that note, there is a node - xmlhttprequest plugin that wraps the node http stuff so it looks like an xmlhttprequest -- does it make sense for that module to have a synchronous option like actual xhrs?
[15:13] Aikar: nope
[15:13] Aikar: cause its not possible
[15:13] hvgotcodes: hmm
[15:14] Aikar: node wont let you block other than the very few functions its already exposed
[15:14] hvgotcodes: Aikar: ok thanx
[15:14] Aikar: and network stuff is not one of them
[15:14] ckknight: hvgotcodes: XHR is async as well (if you use it properly)
[15:14] hvgotcodes: Aikar: is the #!/usr/bin/env node the same as just 'node blah.js'?
[15:14] ckknight: I'd say if you try to do it synchronously, throw an Error
[15:14] Aikar: module loading requires blocking otherwise it would need to be like require('foo', function (foo) { }); which would get messy
[15:15] Aikar: hvgotcodes: yes
[15:15] hvgotcodes: ckknight: right, but i am taking an existing js library, porting it to node, and it has tests for synchronous xhrrs
[15:15] Aikar: it tells your OS to run that file with node
[15:15] saikat has joined the channel
[15:15] Micfire: thought I would wish that I could make Node block when writing highly sync stuff like screenscrapers for example
[15:15] ckknight: hvgotcodes: yeah, I'd get rid of the synchronous ones, change the tests to expect errors in that case
[15:15] Micfire: though you could use Step
[15:15] hvgotcodes: ckknight: what i am working on now is automating the porting process
[15:15] alexandere has joined the channel
[15:16] hvgotcodes: i coult do it in bash
[15:16] Aikar: but fyi, it actually is possible to write your own async require ;P
[15:16] ckknight: Micfire: it returns to you pretty much as soon as it can...
[15:16] hvgotcodes: but am on the fence about doing it with node just to do it
[15:16] ji0n has joined the channel
[15:16] Aikar: but you shouldnt bother, since require is cached and you shouldnt be doing requires after the initial process load unless you reallllly have to
[15:17] lord_pall has joined the channel
[15:17] lord_pall: hayo
[15:18] lord_pall: got an easy one today. I'm using xmlhttprequest to send something up to the node server. What is the proper way to respond to that so that on the requester side the onrequeststatechange event is fired with the proper status code updates?
[15:18] Micfire_ has joined the channel
[15:18] Micfire_: nice.. OSX crashes because of VirtualBox :/
[15:18] Aikar: hvgotcodes: node isnt for everything, i went to write a script for work the other day that runs SVN commits to check a branch to see if its got any unmerged commits, started in node, gave up and went to PHP for it.
[15:19] Micfire_: damn I love my new SSD
[15:19] Micfire_: everything is so FAST
[15:19] Aikar: namely because of module dependencies. I wanted to share that script, and saying 'copy this file then compile your own version of node and then install all these modules' wasnt a simple thing for other coworkers to do :P where as php has everything built in and was quick to write
[15:19] Aikar: moral of story: choose best tool for the job
[15:20] Aikar: runs SVN commands*
[15:20] Micfire_: Aikar: that's called common sense which seems to be missing from 9/10 devs who are following "trends" :)
[15:20] Micfire_: it's all about MongoDB and Node.js right now
[15:20] lord_pall: new shiny
[15:21] lord_pall: I will say, that as a non web person, node is pretty slick
[15:21] Micfire: and because MongoDB is "webscale" though most of the people don't even realize how badly MongoDB actually scales
[15:21] Micfire: I love node too :)
[15:21] Micfire: personally I think Node killed Ruby & PHP
[15:21] lord_pall: I dont like mongodb because I don't seem to be able to get it to work
[15:21] Aikar: killed php? nah
[15:21] Aikar: php wont die lol
[15:21] Aikar: php is big because its so friendly to noobs
[15:21] Aikar: so therefor noobs will continue to use it
[15:21] lord_pall: long-term i look forward to the day when we have a tool like node that uses a grownup language. :)
[15:21] Micfire: of course not in near future
[15:21] Aikar: = high use count = not dead
[15:22] Aikar: also simpler to throw up simple pages
[15:22] lord_pall: so any ideas on how to properly respond to an xmlhttprequest?
[15:22] Micfire: but I think once people start to hear more and more about how much crap Facebook has to deal with because of PHP's lack of performance, people will start with JS
[15:22] Micfire: Aikar: it's about frameworks
[15:23] lord_pall: I think it's more about the logical flow and event distinctions
[15:23] Aikar: the async nature of js, and the prototypal inheritance. the programming style is just a little too much for the college kids who dont know jack shit about programming but sport CS degrees coming out from a java world
[15:23] Micfire: that's true
[15:23] Micfire: I was just about to say that async vs. sync is the biggest issue
[15:23] lord_pall: again, not a web person, but the difference to me is event flow. that makes node a lot more coherent for a normal programmer person
[15:23] Micfire: originally I come from PHP & Ruby world so I have problems with that
[15:23] Aikar: also that
[15:23] lord_pall: I like distinct secitons. I am client, I am server. You respond, I send. Etc
[15:23] Aikar: understanding how an event based lang works

[15:24] lord_pall: it's sorta sad when you thinkabout it
[15:25] Micfire: I like more the whole client displays & formats the data and server sends & receives just the data
[15:25] lord_pall: yes
[15:25] lord_pall: that's the new awesomeness it seems
[15:25] Micfire: in my opinion once you get the hang of it, it's much easier to work with
[15:26] Micfire: but one thing stopping that paradigm is Google
[15:26] Micfire: and other search engines
[15:26] Aikar: I'm primarily a PHP dev (though professionally, not a noob college kid ;P), so your use to being able to follow code line by line down the file. then you throw the event based model at people and it throws your brain into a mindfuck. But thankfully i've also got C++ experience, ASM hacking and deep memory manip, so I got a better understanding on the REAL low level and understand how the event based model flows in a 'line by line' sense lol

[15:29] sorens3n: i see code as changing green letters flowing down the screen...
[15:29] sorens3n: doesnt everyone?
[15:29] lord_pall: It's like actionscript. A language that's coopted to do way more htan it was intended to
[15:29] Micfire: sorens3n: nope.. mine is white text on black
[15:29] sorens3n: oh god... it has me
[15:29] SubStack: lord_pall: javascript and actionscript are both ecmascript
[15:29] sorens3n: :-O
[15:29] lord_pall: i dunno what the is
[15:29] lord_pall: just spinoffs from the same root?
[15:29] Aikar: Micfire: and i meant that in node.js is really never going to pickup to PHP's levels simply because it is harder to get accustomed to, where as PHP is simple for noobs to pickup and learn. in sheer #s PHP will always win because theres 10x more noobs in the world than there are talented programmers :P
[15:30] sorens3n: what kind of levels are we talking about

[15:31] sorens3n: i just recently went heavy into javascript
[15:31] lord_pall: in an abstract sense, how do I send and receive information from node? Assume I can run JS in an abstract sense on the client, and respond on the node side. What's teh best method for this?
[15:31] SubStack: perhaps more than php
[15:31] lord_pall: I'm workign with a mobile client that uses javascript, but not within the context of a page. 
[15:31] Aikar: Micfire: what does history have anything to do with whats currently true for now? :P
[15:32] lord_pall: the xmlhttprequest stuff arrives, but I can't seem to respond cleanly I'm considering just digging up sockets stuff but taht seems dumb to me

[15:35] sorens3n: or make a game?
[15:35] Micfire: I'm playing Crysis 2 :)
[15:35] bingomanatee: yes!
[15:35] bingomanatee: make a game by the 28th and present at the next node meetup. Clock is ticking!
[15:35] bingomanatee: how you like C2?
[15:35] oninoshiko: must learn to stop skimming and start reading "im making crysis 2"
[15:35] sorens3n: hehe, i dont think i'll be attending
[15:35] SubStack: bingomanatee: where is the next meetup?
[15:35] fljitovak has joined the channel
[15:36] lord_pall: node is right proper suited for games too
[15:36] bingomanatee: RocketSpace
[15:36] lord_pall: probably why it makes more sense to me
[15:36] bingomanatee: on the 5th. 
[15:36] lord_pall: same logical flow as stuff I've worked with in the past
[15:36] SubStack: I can give a browserify talk
[15:36] sorens3n: come to nebraska and have a meetup ;)
[15:36] bingomanatee: Sure! 
[15:36] SubStack: oh the 5th, that is soon!
[15:37] Micfire: Anybody used riak-js? :)
[15:37] bingomanatee: Yeah Ryan is prodding me to space them out - we have had a few cram sessions but thery will be monthly (or worse) from now on. 
[15:37] SubStack: actually have something on the 5th scheduled already
[15:37] bingomanatee: too bad - this one is a bout noSQL its going to be best. node.js. meetup. ever.
[15:38] bingomanatee: Its got a better premise than the "Node.js for Designers"
[15:38] bingomanatee: (What were we thinking?)
[15:38] bingomanatee: Well - we will miss you - I might film this one. 
[15:38] Micfire: node.js for designers.. lol :D
[15:39] bingomanatee: yeah I know. 
[15:39] bingomanatee: truDat came up with that one. 
[15:39] oninoshiko: that it would make the 'best. node.js. meetup. ever.'?
[15:39] SubStack: I haven't even done much with databases yet in node
[15:39] Micfire: kinda like css for c++ developers :D
[15:39] SubStack: only just now messing with couch
[15:39] lord_pall: too many damned acronyms
[15:39] bingomanatee: Reminds me of a book I saw at my last job "Apache 2 for Dummies"
[15:40] sorens3n: whats wrong with css for c++ devs?
[15:40] Micfire: honestly though, if you are still using apache, you are kinda dummy :)
[15:40] sorens3n: :D
[15:40] SubStack: the browser/server divide would be a good premise for a round of talks
[15:40] bingomanatee: I want to do couch - I have sailed in with the MongoDB crowd but Couch is defensible - if I ever get NoSQL into a corporate setting its oging to be with Couch probably. 
[15:40] Micfire: couch is dead slow though :/
[15:40] bingomanatee: Yeah lets kook that one up after nodeconf. 
[15:41] bingomanatee: slow read or slow write?
[15:41] Micfire: and the whole view rendering thing is retarded
[15:41] Aikar: couch really isnt designed to be used as a websites db backend
[15:41] losing_ has joined the channel
[15:41] bingomanatee: I doubt Isaacs would be so hot for it if it were an utter dog. 
[15:41] Aikar: their goal is for data synchronization between multiple devices
[15:41] Micfire: Aikar: exactly
[15:41] bingomanatee: so its a JSON form of XML?
[15:41] bingomanatee: well that explains a lot. 
[15:41] Micfire: couchdb has a bizarre goal of being what localstorage is already
[15:41] bingomanatee: There's always Redis :D
[15:42] sorens3n: mmmm, redis.....
[15:42] Micfire: I'm going to try Riak with Redis soon :)
[15:42] bingomanatee: "But MongoDB is Web Scale" 
[15:42] Micfire: as soon as I get this fucking riak-js to actually connect
[15:42] bingomanatee: ( can never get enough of those furry rabbit/puppies)
[15:42] zakabird has joined the channel
[15:42] Aikar: well no, its aiming at running things like cellphones, store your calender, play games, write stuff to db, while on an airplane. then it resyncs to master server and personal PC at home once you regain signal
[15:42] bingomanatee: Well we will have a chance to pitt the NoSQL people against each other IN THE THUNDERDOME on the 5th!
[15:43] Micfire: Aikar: now how does that differ from localstorage? :)
[15:43] Aikar: localstorage implies a browser :P not everything is done in a browser *YET* lol
[15:43] Micfire: yeah but there's no reason why not :)

[15:45] Micfire: Alicia Keys?
[15:45] Aikar: and us non hipster kids dont use iphones, android has this thing called 'widgets' ;) we can have apps displayed on our home screen! lil bit hard to do that as a browser
[15:45] Aikar: and how does localstorage sync between multiple devices O.o? thats not so 'local' :P

[15:46] draginx: Who does he work for? :P
[15:46] mkrecny: draginx: learnboost
[15:46] Aikar: Micfire: you still gotta click the icon :P
[15:46] Micfire: Aikar: heheh :)
[15:46] draginx: ah cool :D now he just needs to make it so u can use auth for redis >.>
[15:47] hvgotcodes: Aikar: you recommend good ole bash for automating a porting process?
[15:47] Aikar: can you rephrase the question
[15:47] sorens3n: draginx: are you referring to Keys?
[15:47] hvgotcodes: I mean if i did it with node, it would be a lot of awk and sed and whatnot
[15:47] draginx: sorens3n: yer
[15:47] lord_pall: you know what.. I think I'm using webkit
[15:48] sorens3n: you can always override the methods
[15:48] Aikar: Micfire: damnit i was gonna take a pic of my phones home screen but somethings on my calendar thats still not public knowledge yet for work :3 lemme scroll down some on cal
[15:48] lord_pall: how does one respond to webkit xmlhttprequests in node?
[15:48] draginx: sorens3n: true
[15:48] bingomanatee: BTW I caught Doug Crockford on a Web Accelleration meetup and he said that [].forEach() is preferrable to for (i in []){ var ii = [i]]...}

[15:49] bingomanatee: yes, though he was equally emphatic that it was just cleaner and more descriptive syntax.
[15:49] strnglp: helloz! anyone here used Dnode with latest node version?
[15:49] Aikar: bingomanatee: sadly foreach is slower than for (i) :(
[15:49] bingomanatee: They are doing a lot with metadata on properties. 
[15:49] sorens3n: <--- 
[15:49] Aikar: i dunno how google screwed that one up
[15:49] bingomanatee: If Doug doesn't mind then I don't. :D
[15:50] Aikar: they should of made forEach simply be a wrapper for for(i
[15:50] baudehlo has joined the channel
[15:50] draginx: unless they have future plans to make it faster ;)

[15:55] mkrecny: sebastiandeutsch: yeah that looks right
[15:57] ckknight: Aikar: the main reason forEach is slower is because of the function invocations.
[15:58] Aikar: ckknight: nope, i wrote a function that does the for(i) and its still faster lol
[15:58] Aikar: its prolly due to some extra logic to support breaking
[15:59] lord_pall: grarg
[15:59] mkrecny: bingomanatee: what are Doug's reasons for pregerring?

[16:03] lord_pall: Is there an explicit send/flush, or is it magic?
[16:03] ckknight: response.end()

[16:07] pauls: ckknight: I converted bth of them to objectids and they're still not equal (BSON.ObjectID(...))
[16:07] ckknight: okay
[16:07] ckknight: I doubt ObjectId handles equality
[16:08] ckknight: you could convert them both to strings

[16:17] lord_pall: okay so the issue is that I'm not sending the readystate response. That's simply a value of "State: <some number>". What's the proper way to send that? response.write("State: 8", "UTF8"); ?
[16:18] ckknight: pauls: there's probably a better way to check for equality.

[16:23] ckknight: it's an efficiency issue at that point
[16:23] ckknight: you could check instanceof

[17:58] draginx: Whats the diff between EasyWebSockets and Socket.IO?
[17:58] doubletap has left the channel
[17:59] jetienne: draginx: at the moment, not much. easywebsocket got 2 backends. one on socket.io, one on google app engine
[17:59] draginx: ah
[17:59] jetienne: draginx: i run a server for the socket.io backend as it is much better from a latency point of view
[17:59] draginx: O_o why would it be better from latency pov?
[17:59] draginx: isnt a socket a socket? :P
[18:00] jetienne: draginx: so if you dont want to bother about coding or running node.js server, easywebsocket.org is cool
[18:00] draginx: ahh
[18:00] julianalucena: jetienne: Yes, I wanna this kind of behavior. Thanks.
[18:00] jetienne: draginx: google app engine isnt doing websocket even if available
[18:00] draginx: thats stupid -_-
[18:00] jetienne: draginx: it is short pulling
[18:01] jetienne: draginx: well google goes for the scalability
[18:01] draginx: I need to finish my nodejs chat yay :D
[18:01] Lagnus has joined the channel
[18:01] V1: But than again.. If you want to run sockets on your own server, you might as well just use Socket.IO as that is was easywebsocket is using ;)
[18:01] jetienne: draginx: and websocket are quite uncommon currently
[18:01] draginx: Which is a shame
[18:01] draginx: should be used more O_o
[18:01] jetienne: draginx: not in firefox or ie
[18:01] jetienne: V1: indeed :)
[18:01] jetienne: V1: im not competing, just making it easier to reach
[18:02] draginx: Yer I know :( When will IE support it? LOL :P
[18:02] V1: Easywebsocket is great if you don't want to run your own server

[21:32] SubStack: ACTION reads the npm changelog to figure out which version got rid of shims
[21:32] isaacs: SubStack: 0.3
[21:32] SubStack: ah thanks!
[21:32] isaacs: SubStack: oh, wait, no, i think it might've been some 0.2 version..
[21:32] Horofox has joined the channel
[21:33] SubStack: well >= 0.3 will do I think
[21:33] isaacs: kewl
[21:33] Yuffster_ has joined the channel
[21:33] isaacs: that is where the "lib" directory semantics changed.
[21:33] SubStack: oh but hmm that won't retrospectively remove shims for packages that people already have installed
[21:33] isaacs: pretty much, 0.3 has feature-parity with 1.0 in terms of the API surface exposed to packages.
[21:33] isaacs: SubStack: no, not without re-installing
[21:34] SubStack: yeah I'll just tell them to update their deps then
[21:34] SubStack: oh hmm
[21:35] SubStack: I could just detect symlinks in browserify and complain about them
[21:35] wadey has joined the channel
[21:35] SubStack: bah that is hard
[21:36] isaacs: you should just require npm 1
[21:36] isaacs: >=1.0.0

[22:04] bingomanatee: Hey, in express, how do you get the raw body of the request?
[22:04] bingomanatee: as in someones posting me JSON?
[22:05] stonecobra: KHURT_: with only one IP, you can only have one process attach to one port, so node has to sit in front of apache, or vice-versa

[22:23] bingomanatee: thanks isaacs

[22:23] bingomanatee: BTW someone was talking trash about the CouchDB speed - how do you fund its return speed and speed under load?
[22:23] bingomanatee: awesome.
[22:23] isaacs: bingomanatee: it is more than adequate for my purposes.
[22:24] isaacs: if you have speed problems with couchdb, your problem is almost certainly a bad algorithm, bad network, or bad disk
