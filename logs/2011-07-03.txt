[02:15] jesusabdullah: Why?
[02:15] jesusabdullah: arch is supposedly pretty pants for scientific applications
[02:15] jesusabdullah: I guess their ATLAS isn't very well optimized or some such

[02:16] jesusabdullah: that said, I usually compile from source if I develop things

[02:16] jesusabdullah: I'm just *really* lazy

[02:18] jesusabdullah: it's mildly pesky
[02:18] jesusabdullah: ah
[02:18] jesusabdullah: With larger screens I stick with stock wm action, but for a little screen like on my netbook, I really like having xmonad
[02:18] jesusabdullah: I'm sure awesome would also be good

[05:09] kevmo314: Hi, I'm trying to make a node http request to another server with a GET parameter that follows, but I can't figure out how to do it.  I've tried http.get(url.parse(urlString), function(data) { ..., but it doesn't seem to work.  What's the correct way to do this?
[05:09] kevmo314: I've also tried passing in {host: [...], port:80, path: urlParsed.pathname + urlParsed.search} but that doesn't work either.
[05:11] bartt has joined the channel
[05:11] kevmo314: On a side note, why doesn't http.get(url.parse([...])) work?  You'd imagine that they'd output/input the same parameters.
[05:12] chjj: kevmo314: you should be passing in host, post, path, etc, but the callback to give gets a response object as its argument
[05:12] kevmo314: Anyone here?
[05:12] chjj: the callback you give*
[05:12] kevmo314: Ah yeah I am.
[05:12] chjj: and then you bind events on the response object
[05:12] systemfault: no nobody here :)
[05:13] kevmo314: Oh okay, I'll try that out.
[05:13] kevmo314: Thanks!
[05:13] chjj: http.get({...}, function(res) { res.on('data', etc); });
[05:14] dexter_e has joined the channel
[05:14] kevmo314: Okay.
[05:15] kevmo314: Also, is the fact that http.get(url.parse()) doesn't work just an oversight?
[05:15] kevmo314: Since url.parse produces pathname but http.get takes path.
[05:15] chjj: yeah, its kind of inconsistent, the "host" you get from url.parse includes the port for example, whereas the host youre expected to give there does not
[05:15] boogyman has joined the channel
[05:16] chjj: so instead you do: { host: url.hostname }
[05:16] chjj: etc

[05:25] SubStack: kevmo314: what does the console.log(parameters) show?

[05:28] kevmo314: I have a PHP script that does the exact same thing and it's been working fine.

[05:39] tayy has joined the channel
[05:40] kevmo314: chjj: Nope, noe rror emitted.
[05:40] chjj: you could also try putting headers: { host: 'google.com' } in the options and throwing the raw ip in the url, it could be that dns lookup is failing
[05:40] kevmo314: Well, I know dns is working, I have a request later on that doesn't have any get parameters and it works fine.
[05:40] chjj: what do you mean get parameters?
[05:41] kevmo314: The ?q=test
[05:41] kevmo314: Like, http://google.com/search works
[05:41] chjj: oh
[05:41] kevmo314: But http://google.com/search?q=test doesn't.
[05:41] kevmo314: I tried tacking an error handler onto the request object as well, no luck.  Looks like it just dies silently...
[05:42] chjj: it should work
[05:42] chjj: this._storeHeader(this.method + ' ' + this.path + ' HTTP/1.1\r\n', this._renderHeaders());
[05:42] chjj: thats where the path goes

[05:58] chjj: theres an updated version
[05:58] chjj: thats the exact code i used

[06:03] kevmo314: I have no idea what could affect it...  do you have any debugging ideas?
[06:04] chjj: the only thing i could think of would be if youre making other requests along side that one
[06:04] kevmo314: No, that request is the only one that happens.
[06:04] chjj: im not sure then
[06:05] chjj: what else are you doing?
[06:05] kevmo314: It's put in an http.createServer but that shouldn't affect it...
[06:05] kevmo314: I'm using formidable to parse a POST form sent to my server.
[06:05] chjj: are you sure the request itself is even being executed?
[06:05] kevmo314: But that's about it...
[06:05] kevmo314: Yeah, it looks that way because if I put a console.log immediately after http.request(opt, function(res) {, it doesn't produce that log.
[06:06] chjj: i mean, are you sure the call to http.request is even being executed?
[06:06] chjj: i realize the callback isnt
[06:07] kevmo314: Well, if I put a console.log directly before and after the http.request, both of those logs appear.
[06:07] kevmo314: So...  I'd imagine it is...
[06:07] chjj: ok
[06:07] kevmo314: Unless the computer just got lazy and is deciding not to execute that line xD
[06:08] chjj: im not sure, thats really strange, something you are doing along side it is obviously affecting it, you should try to rule things out one by one
[06:09] chjj: or you could try the debugger, or node-inspector or something, set break points and step into every call
[06:11] Tobsn: does anyone know how i can query mongodb data 24 hours ago?

[06:17] bogomips2_ has joined the channel
[06:18] kevmo314: Oh.  I think I figured it out...
[06:19] kevmo314: Since JS is single-threaded, when an event is emitted while something is running, does it alternate between the two "threads" or does it complete one then do the other?
[06:20] kbni: the latter
[06:20] kevmo314: Ah.  That's why the request isn't executing.
[06:20] kbni: possibly
[06:20] kbni: show your code?
[06:20] kevmo314: Okay, pastebinning
[06:21] kevmo314: http://pastebin.com/tR6pZQVe

[06:22] MikeMakesIt has joined the channel
[06:22] kbni: uhm
[06:22] kbni: while()
[06:22] kevmo314: So I think what's going on is that the end event is getting called and it's waiting for the http request to complete successfully.  I thought js would alternate between the two threads, so I figured it would complete the http request and that while loop would act as a semaphore.
[06:22] kevmo314: Apparently not.
[06:22] kevmo314: Dangit.
[06:23] kevmo314: Gah, how would I implement that?
[06:23] kevmo314: If I don't have the while in there, the end callback executes without the http response set.
[06:24] kevmo314: ... excluding the fact that it doesn't work right now.
[06:24] kbni: well
[06:24] kbni: use a callback
[06:25] kbni: why dont you check pending in the fancyRequest callback?
[06:25] kevmo314: The url parameter is optional.
[06:25] kevmo314: It's not always sent?
[06:26] kevmo314: Also I do lower pending in the callback, the callback wasn't executing to begin with, so I removed it to see if something in the callback was causing a fuss.
[06:26] kbni: that while loop
[06:27] kbni: is causing your issues
[06:27] kevmo314: Yeah, but I don't know how to write it otherwise.
[06:27] kevmo314: Since the http request isn't always made...
[06:27] kevmo314: And formidable doesn't seem to provide a list of all parameters, rather processes them one by one...
[06:27] kevmo314: I don't know how many parameters there actually are.
[06:28] ambroff_ has joined the channel
[06:28] kbni: I don't really know what that form object does, but why don't you just tell it you are waiting on a url, and if you are, don't call the callback
[06:28] kbni: (call it from the url fetch)
[06:29] kevmo314: Uhh okay.  That seems like a very odd way to do it but it seems like it'll work.

[13:53] Prometheus: just serve a website?
[13:54] dexter_e: it will be a cms server

[13:55] igl: dexter_e: keep in mind node is not even 1.0 yet, nobody recommends it

[13:59] MooGoo: no it shouldnt
[13:59] dexter_e: What about use Node as proxy to Nginx   ala--> http://eastmond.org/blog/?p=45
[13:59] MooGoo: there's a great deal of boiler plate code to get node to work anything like apache + mod_php (or mod_anything)
[14:00] mrsrikanth has joined the channel

[18:06] Chani: what's the best way to grab the filename off the end of an absolute path? some stuff with lastIndexOf() or a regex?

[18:06] tbranyen: Chani: filename.split('.').pop() ?

[18:07] tbranyen: path.split('/').pop() ?

[18:08] igl: or [^\/?*:;{}\\]+\.[^\/?*:;{}\\]{1,4}$

[18:10] tbranyen: compared to a regex? no way

[18:11] tbranyen: substr is nonstandard its just there for legacy reasons that date back to browser wars

[19:54] marcello3d: dunno about efficiencies... I haven't done any profiling/benchmarking/optimization
[19:54] marcello3d: I'm focusing on developer efficiency :)
[19:55] marcello3d: bingo: but sure? which ones did you talk to?

[19:55] dans: thanks rajivn 
[19:56] rajivn: dans: cool, I got it working.
[19:56] mattly has joined the channel
[19:57] dans: rajivn: yeah?
[19:57] rajivn: dans: first thing you need to do is pull "User" in app.js from mongoose. Don't export it in models/user.js
[19:58] rajivn: dans: So after the db is connected to, do User = mongoose.model("User");
[19:58] rajivn: dans: Next in app.post('/user'), after if (err) check, do req.session.user = user;
[19:58] dans: I have that line in my app.js
[19:59] rajivn: dans: That should get you going.
[19:59] dans: i need to define the model first from the schema, and then i can call it with mongoose.model("User")
[19:59] dans: so did you move the exports line into app.js as well?
[20:00] rajivn: dans: No, you don't need to export anything in the schema but you will need to "require" the file since the schema needs to be defined preferably before the db is connected to.
[20:01] rajivn: dans: Let me send you a pull request. Give me 5 minutes.

[20:05] dans: is default production?
[20:06] Validatorian: I can't seem to find the socket.io server module, just the client -- is it in npm? (this would be for capturing a websocket stream in node.js itself)

[20:54] rajivn: although, in the beginning just test if the route is called when you post.
[20:55] rajivn: comment out the bodyParser() line and then inside app.post('/user') do console.log('I am here') as the first line.
[20:56] dans: the route is called
[20:56] dans: i dont even need to comment out bodyparser
[20:56] dall: guys, express.static crashs the server
[20:56] rajivn: thats good. I guess.

[20:58] dall: ab shown --->  Total of 15 requests completed   :-O
[20:58] dall: could someone try it ?
[21:00] rajivn: dans: Are you sending in req, res, next as params? See you requiresLogin method. That is a route middleware
[21:00] dans: sorry, i was being retarded
[21:00] dans: new error
[21:00] dans: :p
[21:00] rajivn: :)
[21:01] dans: cannot set property user of undefined
[21:01] dans: so req is defined
[21:01] dans: but not req.body
[21:02] dall: rajivn, what could it be?
[21:02] rajivn: So that's bodyParser's job right? What happens if before the req.body.user call, you explicitly set req.body.user to an object I described above?
[21:02] Nexxy: why would you do that? ;<
[21:02] Nexxy: that's liek request forgery!
[21:02] Nexxy: server side
[21:03] dans: rajivn: the error is on the line where i explicitly set it
[21:04] dans:   req.body.user = { email: 'test@test.com', password: 'test' };
[21:04] rajivn: OK. so express.bodyParser is not doing its job I guess. But why?
[21:04] dans: maybe i should reinstall express?

[22:38] bnoordhuis: oal: gist?
[22:38] oal: Wait, I think I changed something else as well, 'w' gives the same now
[22:38] oal: Sorry
[22:38] kuhrt has joined the channel
[22:39] kuhrt: anyone here familiar with mongoose?
[22:39] konobi: oal: open(2)
[22:40] konobi: oal, the docs give reference to that... which means you can just use "man" to get details of the interface
[22:42] tmpvar has joined the channel
[22:43] konobi: oal: are you talking about wondering what 'r', 'a', 'w' map to in terms of the open(2) constants?
[22:44] oal: I think I got it now, but the thing is it should be in the documentation for lazy programmers
[22:44] oal: :)
[22:44] konobi: oal: meh
[22:45] konobi: oal: should we also redo all the docs for javascript as well?
[22:45] konobi: i mean, node is just javascript bindings to a unix/posix interface... which is well documented by itself
[22:46] bnoordhuis: konobi: that's a cop out
[22:46] smtlaissezfaire has joined the channel
[22:46] konobi: bnoordhuis: patches welcome
[22:46] oal: Correct, but it'll be like an extra line or so in the docs, no problem
[22:46] bnoordhuis: and besides, i had to look up in fs.js what 'w' did exactly :-/
[22:46] konobi: c, perl, php, ruby all have the same interface
[22:46] mark__ has joined the channel
[22:47] bnoordhuis: and they all document it without referring to unix man pages
[22:47] bnoordhuis: what's your point again?
[22:48] konobi: bnoordhuis: patches welcome
[22:48] konobi: =0)
[22:48] mark__: I've been using Node v0.2.3 and I'm upgrading to v0.4.7 using the module N, and I'm currently on 0.4.7 ... however NPM is having a "very rare, failed to to unpack tarball" error whenever I install a module - I'm using cygwin.
[22:50] mark__: any clue, help, pointers?

[22:51] konobi: bnoordhuis: the point being is that when you work something out that you're not sure about... why not patch the docs so that everyone can know in future and you don't need to remind yourself later
[22:52] konobi: https://github.com/joyent/node/tree/v0.4/doc/api
[22:54] bnoordhuis: konobi: that's actually why i asked oal to open an issue - so i don't forget to

[23:05] tauren: I've created a Model.parse() method that converts a date string into a Date object. Works great if I run Model.fetch().
[23:06] adrianmg1 has joined the channel
[23:06] tauren: But parse() isn't run if I manually create the model:  model = new Model({date: "2011-05-02T12:00:00Z"})
[23:07] tauren: what's the best way to preprocess json when it isn't getting fetched?

[23:16] onr has left the channel
[23:16] tauren: My solution is to put the logic in Model.initialize:  if (_.isString(this.get('start')) { this.set({start: DateParser.parse(this.get('start'))},{silent: true}); }

[23:28] HammHetField: I'm searching for a nice tutorial about nodejs that isn't about making a web server, I'd like to make some kind of compiler, like what coffeescript has with the coffee command
[23:28] HammHetField: any links or thoughts where I could find tuts about that ?
[23:29] chjj: well i think coffeescript uses jison
[23:29] stevezd has joined the channel
[23:29] jma has joined the channel
[23:29] HammHetField: um I know it uses node
[23:30] chjj: https://github.com/zaach/jison
[23:30] HammHetField: never heard of jison so maybe it uses both I have no idea
[23:30] chjj: jison is a parser generator
[23:30] squeese has joined the channel
[23:30] HammHetField: um
[23:30] HammHetField: okay I'll look at that then
[23:30] HammHetField: thanks
[23:30] jesusabdullah: It uses jison to parse coffeescript into javascript, using node as the runtime, and then uses node again to execute the resulting javascript
[23:31] jesusabdullah: You may find other technologies more useful, as iirc jison is not very well documented

[23:34] CStumph has joined the channel
