[00:03] maxogden: chapter 3 of http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596806767.do?sortby=publicationDate explains it in explicit detail but the basic idea is that instead of modifying prototypes you just copy them to a new context specific object

[00:10] maxogden: josh9: yeah its not great for super beginners but great for intermediate
[00:10] AvianFlu: mjr_, win!
[00:11] josh9: maxogden: what is the use case for subclassing? is it similar to parent class that it's methods are inherited by his kids?
[00:11] mjr_: AvianFlu: have you guys gotten any performance numbers on 0.4 vs 0.6 for your operation?
[00:12] AvianFlu: mjr_, we aren't running 0.6 in production yet
[00:12] AvianFlu: we've had to port several dozen big libraries, and we're only just now almost there
[00:12] josh9: maxogden: i am coming from ruby and used to classical inheritence
[00:13] freewil has joined the channel
[00:13] maxogden: josh9: yeah you can do it in a way similar to rubys metaclasses where if you change the parent prototype the children will get it
[00:13] secoif has joined the channel
[00:14] maxogden: josh9: but you can also do one-off non autoupdating subclasses
[00:14] mjr_: AvianFlu: we use almost no libraries, so this has made it a lot easier to switch over.

[00:19] edwardw: I need to use older node.js (< 0.6.0), but seems latest npm doesn't work with 0.5.x node.js
[00:19] edwardw: is that the case? if yes, is there any workaround?
[00:19] isaacs: edwardw: use an older npm
[00:19] isaacs: edwardw: npm 1.0 should work with node 0.4 or 0.5 or 0.6

[00:38] tyler-vortex: http://howtonode.org/hello-node
[00:39] tyler-vortex: I'm trying to use mysql db-node to perform a query in the database, but can not find any documentation about it.
[00:39] ShinyDarkness: tyler-vortex: PHP's so-called "documentation" is worse than having nothing at all.
[00:40] ShinyDarkness: tyler-vortex: It is full of hastily, sloppily written examples.
[00:41] tyler-vortex: see this site
[00:41] tyler-vortex: http://nodejsdb.org/db-mysql/
[00:41] zomg: ShinyDarkness: the point is usually not to be perfect but to demonstrate how to use something :P
[00:41] tyler-vortex: # in querying
[00:41] zomg: Of course the examples left by users are a whole different matter...

[00:42] Phlogistique: ShinyDarkness: I think you mean s/'s so-called "documentation"//
[00:42] ShinyDarkness: zomg: Nobody says sample code should be perfect, but most examples are not very good ones, and some of them are simply awful.
[00:42] zomg: ShinyDarkness: such as?
[00:42] ShinyDarkness: zomg: Such as the ones for regular expressions.
[00:43] ShinyDarkness: Phlogistique: Yes, that too.
[00:43] JmZ: does anyone know of some sort of queue module which i can use to process jobs sequentially (or process a specified number in parallel but no more)? preferrably one i can run "indefinitely", waiting for jobs to be added

[00:47] isaacs: once a month i look at the biggest packages in the registry, and try to figure out why they're so big.
[00:47] TooTallNate: haha, ya that was a whoopsie on my part :p
[00:47] dshaw_: isaacs: yes
[00:47] dshaw_: isaacs: back
[00:47] isaacs: dshaw_: so, you'd mentioned about having an `npm verify` or `npm checkdeps` command
[00:48] isaacs: dshaw_: would it satisfy your use-case if we just fixed whatever the hell is wrong with `npm update`?
[00:48] dshaw_: isaacs: maybe
[00:48] isaacs: k
[00:48] dshaw_: isaacs: Really don't want to require the update. Just notify.
[00:49] isaacs: dshaw_: what about `npm outdated`?
[00:49] isaacs: that works
[00:49] dshaw_: So maybe verify is a separate step prior to update. 
[00:49] isaacs: or maybe it doesn't, and that's why update is busted, i'm not sure. but it *should* do exactly that
[00:49] isaacs: outdated is like a dry-run update
[00:49] dshaw_: outdated checks against the repository
[00:49] isaacs: right
[00:49] dshaw_: verify would check against package.json
[00:50] dshaw_: isaacs: does that make sense?
[00:50] isaacs: and tell you that you have something invalid installed?
[00:50] isaacs: doesn't ls already do that?
[00:51] dshaw_: isaacs: outdated against the package.json?
[00:51] mmalecki: isaacs: hey, I'm trying to set up local registry. when I request registry.local (which is redirected to /registry/_design/app/_rewrite), couch starts spitting out multiple errors like:

[00:52] mmalecki: oh, and I had to turn off secure_rewrites

[00:53] mmalecki: isaacs: 1.1.1
[00:53] isaacs: hm… weird
[00:53] joaojeronimo: I'm going to write something to allow grafeceful restarts of an app that was forked with the cluster module, pretty much like the cluster module from learnboost (but worse of course). Has anyone done that and would like to share the code ?
[00:53] dshaw_: isaacs: yeah, primary issue is related to tarballs
[00:53] dshaw_: isaacs: False positives with tarball dependencies
[00:54] isaacs: dshaw_: you mean, if you have a dependency like "foo":"http://blah/foo.tgz"?
[00:54] Brandon_R: cluster?
[00:55] isaacs: dshaw_: how would npm know if that's valid or not, anyway?
[00:55] Brandon_R: issacs, any plans on integrating cluster into npm?
[00:55] Brandon_R: so it can run on all cores :)
[00:55] isaacs: Brandon_R: no plans, no

[00:55] isaacs: TheLifelessOne: socket.io
[00:56] dshaw_: isaacs: the dependencies were just up-to-date :)
[00:56] TheLifelessOne: just pure websockets
[00:56] Brandon_R: k
[00:56] Brandon_R: there are plenty
[00:56] isaacs: TheLifelessOne: maybe this?
[00:56] isaacs: websocket.io          Socket.IO websocket server                                    =rauchg
[00:56] TheLifelessOne: what.
[00:57] isaacs: there's a few out there.  i haven't used any of them, though
[00:57] dshaw_: isaacs: so, if I peg my dependencies on redis 0.6.6, I get a notification from outdated that that package is outdated.
[00:57] isaacs: in my experience, if you think you need websockets, what you really need is socket.io
[00:57] TheLifelessOne: Possibly, but I don't want all the fallback stuff.
[00:58] isaacs: dshaw_: oh, because of that "show newer possibilities" thing.
[00:58] isaacs: ugh
[00:58] SleepingPrgmr has joined the channel
[00:58] isaacs: ACTION wants to rip out update and outdated, and just make `npm install` always do the right hting.
[00:58] dshaw_: isaacs: The objective with verify would be to handle when you update your git files and know when you need to run update
[00:58] dshaw_: :)
[00:58] isaacs: there are too many commands here, tha'ts hte problem
[00:59] Me1000 has joined the channel
[00:59] isaacs: install, link, rm, ls.  that's like 99% of what you need.
[00:59] TooTallNate: TheLifelessOne: websocket.io doesn't have fallbacks, it's just pure websockets
[01:00] TheLifelessOne: I see.
[01:00] davidbanham has joined the channel
[01:00] TheLifelessOne: I could have sworn it did...
[01:00] TooTallNate: socket.io does fallbacks
[01:00] xerox: gotta love link

[01:00] Brandon_R: socketio is probably the best node module ever a:)
[01:00] xerox: >.<
[01:01] TheLifelessOne: https://github.com/LearnBoost/websocket.io this one?
[01:01] TooTallNate: TheLifelessOne: indeed
[01:01] murvin: hi.. i have question about using mongodb with replica set.
[01:01] TheLifelessOne: ok, cool. Thanks.
[01:01] murvin: when I set up connection, do I need to specify all the host IP?  or mongodb drive is smart enough to discover all primary, secondary hosts?
[01:03] JmZ: ok how about this: how can i make async's queue "wait" for tasks?
[01:03] JmZ: e.g. if i have a setInterval callback running which adds tasks every n minutes
[01:03] dshaw_: isaacs: so if node_modules contains redis 0.6.5 and I update the package.json indicating that we're using 0.6.6, I want to flag that our developers should update.

[01:15] josh9: guys, i was in LA node.js meetup last night with ryan dhal and it was awesome. he was talking about his experience that led him to build node. 
[01:15] josh9: hi tried doing it in ruby - ebb
[01:16] josh9: but it was slow due to the language and also the GIL (global interpreter lock)
[01:17] AAA_awright: :-\
[01:17] quackquack: when you do an `npm install <local folder>` does it copy the folder to `node_modules`?
[01:17] AAA_awright: It's stuff like that which makes me question Node.js
[01:18] soffi has joined the channel
[01:18] isaacs: quackquack: yessir
[01:18] simenbrekken has joined the channel
[01:18] zomg: btw how do you guys think node compares to something like gevent and twisted?
[01:19] isaacs: AAA_awright: stuff like what?
[01:19] quackquack: isaacs: alrighty, thanks =D
[01:19] isaacs: quackquack: you can use `npm link` to symlink it
[01:19] AAA_awright: I'd been looking for a Javascript I/O framework for years, I don't handle the C++ APIs well enough to hack them like ry did, but all the initial engineering mistakes... I shudder at how anyone could have thought stuff like that was acceptable
[01:19] zomg: A guy I know who is a python fanboy is always like "you should use gevent/twisted/some-other-lib-of-his instead"
[01:19] zomg: =)
[01:19] quackquack: isaacs: k, good to know
[01:19] AAA_awright: I mean we sort of take it for granted that callbacks are called exactly once, event emitters can be called any number of times, but that wasn't always the case
[01:19] zomg: Personally not familiar enough with any of the python solutions to really say anything about it
[01:19] AAA_awright: Luckily that was fixed early on
[01:20] AvianFlu: zomg, it's the same functionality with harder APIs, a slower language, and a much less robust open-source community
[01:20] zomg: Heh
[01:20] josh9: there is also eventmachine in ruby
[01:21] AAA_awright: Python has entirely the wrong notion of what an event is
[01:21] josh9: i really want to try node, but all i do at the moment is websites. and nothing is insane real-time, so i am not sure if node is the right tool. i can do whatever i need with sinatra+backbone at the moment.
[01:21] AAA_awright: It's not an evented language, and most aren't
[01:22] AAA_awright: Javascript was literally designed for use cases like this so it's a natural fit
[01:22] zomg: josh9: no reason you couldn't use node for that, there's some neat libs for it like whatever that one was which dynamically updates your CSS on the fly
[01:22] AAA_awright: Also, object model
[01:23] josh9: AAA_awright: what do u mean by 'callbacks are called exactly once'. is it a feature in js?
[01:23] RobWC has joined the channel
[01:23] okuryu has joined the channel
[01:23] josh9: zomg: but isn't building a regular website will be a pain in the but since it will reuire a lot of lines that are low level?
[01:24] AAA_awright: josh9: If I provide a callback to a function, say, fs.readFile('file', function(err, data){}); that function will be called exactly one time, not twice, not never
[01:25] AAA_awright: (if a process exit doesn't come first)
[01:25] josh9: AAA_awright: i am not sure why would it be called more times..
[01:25] joaojeronimo: anyone else can't get the redis module to work in NodeJS v0.6.x ?
[01:26] AAA_awright: josh9: For fs.readFile maybe, but what about HTTP requests?
[01:26] AAA_awright: Or what if the file doesn't exist?
[01:27] AAA_awright: It might seem obvious, especially now that it's formally documented, that it's called exactly once, but you should look up the old promises system there was... woa boy
[01:27] AAA_awright: That had to go before I would start using Node.js
[01:28] AAA_awright: It did in what, 0.3?
[01:28] josh9: AAA_awright: interesting. so a while a go you would make a non blocking http request, and your callback might be called twice?
[01:28] michaelhartau has joined the channel
[01:29] AAA_awright: josh9: Well, like if you have an HTTP server, you don't provide a callback that handles incoming requests, you provide an event
[01:29] gavin_huang has joined the channel
[01:30] AAA_awright: There is a shorthand where you can provide a default event, but it's not a callback as such, especially since it lacks the error argument as the first argument
[01:31] zomg: josh9: yeah it's possible if all you want to do is send a few html files
[01:31] zomg: Perhaps you should do some project of your own where you can use node better to its strengths =)
[01:31] mikey_p: does anyone still use browserify?
[01:31] mikey_p: having lots of problems with it
[01:32] rwasiele_ has joined the channel
[01:32] josh9: zomg: someone at the meetup last night gave me a good usecase for node - a site that shows the position of cars in a formula-1 race.
[01:32] tbranyen: another good use case is if you wanna write javascript
[01:33] AAA_awright: ^
[01:33] josh9: you make a call to node, and it creates a long connection that constantly send (via websockets?) data to the browser.
[01:33] franksalim: conversely, if you want to write python, there is nothing wrong with twisted or gevent
[01:33] josh9: (i guess u have to use modern web-browser for that)

[01:34] Rockj: Q: any problem compiling nodejs under debian squeeze? after compilation I have tests failing in latest stable. 
[01:35] mikey_p: josh9: if you use something like socket.io it'll use whatever the best method is for each browser, websocket, xhr, flash sockets, etc
[01:35] josh9: mikey_p: nice
[01:36] josh9: too bad i don't need to monitor formula-1 race anytime soon..
[01:36] zomg: I dabbled with some real time collaboration stuff with node at first
[01:36] Rockj: http://pastie.org/2957820
[01:36] josh9: i guess if you have a single page website with many 'chatty' ajax requests, node can be nice as well.
[01:36] zomg: basically wrote an editor which would show edits everyone does to everyone else
[01:37] zomg: This is my first "real" nodejs project =) www.bf3web.com
[01:39] josh9: zomg: i see stuff like this in my network tab - /socket.io/1/websocket
[01:39] zomg: Yeah
[01:40] franksalim: AAA_awright: i can't resist nitpicking something you said about python v. js. Timers and events aren't in the core JavaScript language, either
[01:40] zomg: socket.io is a lib for node which makes real time browser<->server communication really simple
[01:41] davidbanham has joined the channel
[01:41] AAA_awright: franksalim: How could it? Javascript is a language not a library
[01:41] Nuck: Did I see what I think I saw in the node changelogs?
[01:41] josh9: zomg: so u wrote both the client and the server with js, right?
[01:41] Nuck: Npm integrated into node itself?
[01:41] zomg: josh9: yeah
[01:41] franksalim: AAA_awright: JavaScript is a language with a few popular runtimes :)
[01:41] zomg: most of the client stuff is in socket.io, I just wrote some client side JS which listens to the events socket.io gives it
[01:42] AAA_awright: Nuck: I know, we need to find who's responsible for that
[01:42] AAA_awright: Not cool
[01:42] zomg: and some code on the server end which sends events to socket.io
[01:42] Nuck: AAA_awright: I don't care, TBH.
[01:42] Nuck: I knew it was bound to happen
[01:42] josh9: zomg: do u use any framework like express?
[01:42] wojohowitz has joined the channel
[01:42] AAA_awright: Nuck: It was bound to happen the same way nuclear winter is bound to happen
[01:42] AAA_awright: IT'S NOT A GOOD THING
[01:42] Nuck: How's npm on Windows, anyways?
[01:43] zomg: josh9: yeah, I use express for serving the pages and templating, sessions and such
[01:43] soffi: I feel it is as neccesary as integrating V8
[01:43] franksalim: AAA_awright: the language spec doesn't define events or timeouts. the string 'setTimeout' does not appear in ECMA-262
[01:43] AAA_awright: franksalim: Right
[01:44] franksalim: so the event-nature js comes from the runtimes and the community
[01:44] AAA_awright: Right
[01:44] Wizek-other has joined the channel
[01:44] franksalim: the event driven libraries for python make up only a subset of that language community
[01:44] AAA_awright: That's how it should be
[01:45] franksalim: but the language designs are not, i think, responsible for that

[01:46] josh9: zomg: looks amazing. let me know if i get the highlevel - let's say i go to the /server/<server-id> page. you make a call to your node server and the connection stay open between my browser and the server, and you tell node: 'hey, whenever there is an event in the game, send it to me.' and node using socket.io to send it back to the browser. you send back json with data, and your client side render the 
[01:46] josh9: data with the template.

[01:47] josh9: zomg: wow, everything is real time, ha? all the scores
[01:47] zomg: Most of it is, yes. There are some limitations due to how the BF3 admin protocol works though
[01:48] murvin: Wondering.. why Mongo Driver (.e.g Mongoose), has to define all the servers for Replica Set.   Can't the driver just connect to one server and get all the hosts from configuration table?
[01:48] zomg: For example the scores are fetched every once in a while from the server (I forgot what interval I gave it)
[01:48] zooli has joined the channel
[01:48] murvin: and keep a copy.
[01:48] zooli: hi
[01:48] zomg: but the events and chatlog are pushed by the BF 3 server itself
[01:48] AAA_awright: Nuck: One of the developers mentioned not even HTTP would have been included in Node.js if it weren't the biggest protocol in use... So WHY THE HELL NPM
[01:48] zooli: anyone had success compiling for ARM?
[01:48] AAA_awright: People have got to care about stuff like this
[01:48] josh9: zomg: what about the UI? do you load all the html+templates when i first go to /server/<server-id> ?
[01:48] incon has joined the channel
[01:49] zomg: josh9: yeah, I used knockoutjs for the UI
[01:49] markeeto has joined the channel
[01:49] zomg: so it basically has the templates for rendering the UI elements embedded in the basic markup
[01:49] josh9: zomg: is it mvc for client side, like backbone?
[01:49] zomg: knockout is MVVM
[01:49] zomg: So sort of yeah
[01:49] isaacs: Nuck, AAA_awright: you realize of course, npm isn't "included in node itself"
[01:49] simenbrekken has joined the channel
[01:50] isaacs: it's not compiled into the binary
[01:50] Nuck: I know that
[01:50] isaacs: it's included in teh .pkg and .msi installers, but those are conveniences anyway
[01:50] AAA_awright: I don't think you could do that if you wanted to
[01:50] AAA_awright: It's still bloat
[01:50] isaacs: AAA_awright: python has proven that one can get away with putting all sorts of bloat in a binary
[01:50] Nuck: isaacs: What about if I make install?
[01:50] AAA_awright: Python is an awful example to compare to
[01:50] franksalim: you could do nearly anything if you wanted to. computers.
[01:50] isaacs: if we were the sort to want that, then node would not be what it is
[01:50] AAA_awright: If in doubt, do it unlike python
[01:50] isaacs: AAA_awright: it's the perfect example, since it typifies exactly what i'm talking about
[01:51] isaacs: for sure :)
[01:51] isaacs: Nuck: ./compile --without-npm
[01:51] AAA_awright: That should be the default... but even better it shouldn't be in the source tree at all
[01:51] Nuck: isaacs: Aye but the regular make install does compile it?
[01:51] Nuck: I think it's good personally
[01:51] isaacs: AAA_awright: you're welcome to float that patch in your own own fork :)
[01:51] isaacs: Nuck: if you dont' configure it not to, yes
[01:52] isaacs: Nuck: in the 0.6 branch
[01:52] Nuck: Npm installation was an extra step
[01:52] isaacs: yes, a very slow annoying error-prone extra step
[01:52] Nuck: Having it in node could help make installation easier
[01:52] isaacs: for the vast majority of users, this is a definite improvement.
[01:52] marcostoledo has joined the channel
[01:52] isaacs: minus the hiccups in 0.6.3, of course
[01:52] Nuck: isaacs: i agree entirely
[01:52] josh9: zomg: very cool. do u have any complex object models going on there? i am not sure what are the best practices in js for creating and extending objects and scarced to jump onto so many new things at once.
[01:52] Nuck: How's npm on windows?
[01:52] isaacs: now it's pretty good
[01:52] Nuck: Did you get binaries in it yet?
[01:53] isaacs: Nuck: no, anything that requires node-waf wont' build
[01:53] zomg: josh9: nothing very complicated, it just has a server object which keeps track of players, the map list and things like that
[01:53] Nuck: isaacs: So no native modules, k
[01:53] isaacs: Nuck: i mean, npm makes an honest go at it
[01:53] zooli: http://pastebin.com/fJRnUeZL any tips on make error?
[01:53] isaacs: Nuck: if you've got a batch script that can build your thing, npm will run it.
[01:53] isaacs: Nuck: but, node-waf stuff, no.
[01:53] AAA_awright: I had the same problem with the build system, though last I checked that was gone, thankfully (and replaced with another python system? Ugh)
[01:53] josh9: zomg: is this object lives across requests?
[01:54] Nuck: isaacs: Could you theoretically take donations and get a windows server to compile addons under minGW or something?
[01:54] isaacs: we do need a better approach for binary modules, but there are other bridges to cross first, i think
[01:54] zomg: josh9: yeah, they have to because it needs to stay connected to the game servers
[01:54] zomg: and of course it makes sense to keep them because otherwise it would always need to query for the data when someone performs a request
[01:54] josh9: zomg: what do u mean by 'they'. also, do u use a db?
[01:54] adamstantonvan has joined the channel
[01:54] zomg: by they I mean the server objects, as there's more than one (there's one per server)
[01:55] zomg: it uses mongodb to store server connection details, user access levels and such

[02:01] isaacs: mikey_p: but, each package has a "time" object, which tracks when everything was published

[02:04] zomg: Yeah I didn't bother doing it all with ajax
[02:04] josh9: zomg: i also noticed socket.io in each of the pages. is there a reason you send back this js file every time?

[02:05] chrisvwebdev has left the channel
[02:05] josh9: the same with knockout.js
[02:05] zomg: Sure, but it would still need to be linked in order for the browser to know it needs to load it from the cache
[02:05] ircdearia has joined the channel
[02:06] jonsul: depending on your client-side needs, you shouldn't need to keep reloading the pages either

[02:10] josh9: zomg: got it. thanks for the insights. is there a good sample app for node that you recommend? i don't need any realtime. just simple site where people upload images and other rank them.
[02:10] jonsul: would most any do? ie. persistance.js moose
[02:10] zomg: josh9: express has some simple examples like a blog or something like that I think

[03:14] isaacs: joaojeronimo: curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo npm_install=alpha sh
[03:14] isaacs: of course, you should probably not sudo something you curl.
[03:14] joaojeronimo: isaacs: I guess so... it's the latest that CentOS 5 has to offer :(
[03:14] davidwalsh has joined the channel
[03:14] isaacs: so, you know, download it, read it, etc.  then run it as "cat install.sh | sudo npm_install=alpha sh"
[03:14] isaacs: joaojeronimo: CentOS is the MSIE of linux
[03:14] isaacs: joaojeronimo: lemme guess, tar --version says something like 1.15.1?
[03:15] isaacs: if you're lucky, and it's not gnutar 1.12 or something
[03:15] joaojeronimo: isaacs: exactly 1.15.1... you're amazing lol
[03:15] isaacs: joaojeronimo: i'm not so amazing.  it's a very common bug :)
[03:15] joaojeronimo: I love CentOS but I wish I could upgrade this box... but I can't...
[03:15] isaacs: probably the most common thing that goes wrong is bad system tar versions.  bad enough to decide to write tar myself.
[03:16] joaojeronimo: isaacs: ohh... so it's really js based tar ??
[03:16] isaacs: joaojeronimo: it is in the alpha versions, yeah
[03:16] isaacs: npm 1.1 uses that
[03:16] jonsul: @isaacs the new alpha is? sick.
[03:16] isaacs: that's the one bundling with node
[03:17] joaojeronimo: isaacs: impressive...
[03:17] joaojeronimo: isaacs: do you have something separate for that in github ? how do the benchmarks compare (just out of curiosity)
[03:18] isaacs: joaojeronimo: it's https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar
[03:18] isaacs: joaojeronimo: it's a bit slower than most system tars.
[03:18] joaojeronimo: great, thanks isaacs
[03:18] isaacs: but it's worth it, to have it not be a black-box
[03:18] isaacs: it's also very alpha still.

(kill a worker, reload it with a changed .js file, kill other worker then, do the same... workers should be requiring an app file and executing something in it)
[03:22] tbranyen: joaojeronimo: i'm doing something kind of like that
[03:22] tbranyen: minus the reloading
[03:22] tbranyen: from a new file
[03:22] blueadept`: jonsul: yes it is worth it
[03:22] joaojeronimo: great tbranyen :) did you get inspiration from learnboost's old cluster module ?
[03:23] blueadept`: jonsul: some hardcore noders are going to be there
[03:23] tbranyen: joaojeronimo: no i just realized that restarting was sometimes necessary heh
[03:23] dr0id has joined the channel
[03:23] tbranyen: actually loading from a file wouldn't be hard
[03:24] tbranyen: i think it'd just be an eval fsReadSync
[03:24] tbranyen: or maybe require would be sufficient
[03:24] tbranyen: not sure
[03:24] joaojeronimo: tbranyen: it's not, I've written something very bad that works like that...
[03:24] tbranyen: well eval readFileSync should def work
[03:25] tbranyen: gonna implement that in my server right now :-p
[03:25] tbranyen: i wanted to break it up anyways
[03:25] joaojeronimo: tbranyen: eval fsReadSync ? app = require("./app"); app(); would be enough I think..
[03:26] joaojeronimo: lol tbranyen how about just forking learnboost's cluster and making it use the built in cluster module but with all the 3rd party module juice and REPL and realtime administration things ?

[03:38] tbranyen: joaojeronimo: i see no benefit to that over this
[03:38] tbranyen: this is one line that has the same performance impact of a require
[03:38] tbranyen: actually less
[03:38] isaacs: tbranyen: eval has crap performance
[03:39] joaojeronimo: tbranyen: you're probably right... I just have a possibly healthy aversion to eval lol
[03:39] tbranyen: isaacs: compared to setting up an entirely new execution context with require?
[03:39] isaacs: it confuses the v8 gremlins
[03:39] isaacs: tbranyen: yes.
[03:39] isaacs: tbranyen: require() doesn't set up a new context
[03:39] tbranyen: isaacs: it used to, thats how it kept local context... ?
[03:39] isaacs: tbranyen: unless you have NODE_MODULE_CONTEXT=1 in your environemnt, whcih you probably don't
[03:39] insin has joined the channel
[03:39] isaacs: tbranyen: no, it's just a closure, man

[03:39] tbranyen: its always been?
[03:39] isaacs: yep
[03:40] isaacs: unless you set the flag in the env
[03:40] isaacs: then it does separate contexts.
[03:40] isaacs: but like, no one does that
[03:40] isaacs: eval makes your program un-optimizable
[03:41] isaacs: tbranyen: it uses the vm.runInThisContext()
[03:41] tbranyen: isaacs: i'm look in the source, so Script.runInNewContext is simply a closure under the hood?
[03:41] tbranyen: ing*
[03:41] unomi has joined the channel
[03:42] isaacs: tbranyen: no, we put the closure on it

[03:43] tbranyen: oh i see, i guess i always assumed the new context was being used
[03:43] isaacs: only if you ask for it
[03:43] isaacs: dude, if there was a way to easily make require() be faster, we'd've done it already
[03:43] isaacs: there may be hard ways, that aren't worth the complexity overhead.
[03:44] tbranyen: at the cost of a separate context tho
[03:44] tbranyen: which i thought it had
[03:44] isaacs: but the $100 bills on the sidewalks are all already picked up
[03:44] isaacs: meh.  closures are good enough
[03:44] tbranyen: right, but obv i'd think there'd be a diff in perf under the false assumption :-p
[03:44] tbranyen: m yb
[03:44] isaacs: the thing about eval is that it puts you on the slow path, and you lose the filename thingie on the stack traces.
[03:44] isaacs: it's really truly evil
[03:45] tracker1 has joined the channel
[03:45] tbranyen: oh eval isn't perfect by any means, but it has its uses

[03:52] Marak: i'm trying to figure out a good number to set as a fixture for hook.io messages
[03:52] Marak: var fixture = new Buffer(50000).toString('utf8');

[03:53] Marak: var fixture = new Buffer(10000).toString('utf8');  ?

[04:10] Marak: joaojeronimo: just trying to sort out a reasonable size that people can expect to always work
[04:11] Marak: joaojeronimo: where its like, you've hit X, it's time to start using streams instead
[04:11] joaojeronimo: Marak: ok got it... it's a bit subjective and a matter of opinion isn't it ?
[04:11] Marak: joaojeronimo: yes
[04:12] joaojeronimo: Marak: I'd say 10000...
[04:13] Marak: joaojeronimo: that seems small i think. id like to be able to send the entire contents of an HTML page in a message, that seems like a decent litmus test
[04:16] joaojeronimo: Marak: Google says the average length of an html document is 376kb (http://code.google.com/speed/articles/web-metrics.html), if all of them follow a normal distribution blablabla, I think you'd be fine if you make room for.. 450kb ? But that seems toooooo much...

[11:25] jetienne: "are determed by workers" typo in readme
[11:26] AndreasMadsen_: Also remember that it fix the #2060 issue.
[11:27] jetienne: i dont understand what you mean by assigned. but you can communicate between thread by socket and/or fd with current API. this is how it is done in other lib
[11:27] Brandon_R: since clusters can communicate across cores, can it be extended like erlang to nativly communicate across machines or am i getting the wrong idea here?

[11:30] Brandon_R: shouldn't   for (var i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {  be   for (var i = 0; i < numCPUs - 1; i++) {  since the mater worker takes up 1 core?
[11:30] Brandon_R: or it could use something like zeromq or rabbitmq
[11:30] mike5w3c_ has joined the channel
[11:30] Brandon_R: to communicate instead of a shared state

[11:31] AndreasMadsen_: I really don't know, I think the master use so little CPU power that you want to have CPUnum workers, also remember the setupMaster({workers: CPUs-1})  
[11:31] jetienne: Brandon_R: i assume it is because the master doesnt do much, so it doesnt need a full cpu
[11:32] liar has joined the channel
[11:32] Brandon_R: oh
[11:32] jetienne: as AndreasMadsen just said :)
[11:33] Brandon_R: this cluster module is making me feel like a little kid on xmas morning
[11:33] drostie: heh.
[11:34] drostie: Andreas, you should have waited until Monday and called it a Sinterklaas gift. ^_^
[11:34] mmalecki: wtf
[11:35] AndreasMadsen_: I am very happy that you think so, after working on this so long without any comments, it is nice to get some thanks :=
[11:35] mmalecki: I just did a / search in vim
[11:35] mmalecki: switched to chrome
[11:35] mmalecki: pressed ctrl+f and it popped out with search string from vim
[11:35] mmalecki: os x, chrome dev and mvim
[11:36] Brandon_R:  i need to learn vim or emac
[11:36] Brandon_R: which one?
[11:36] kpko-fn: vim
[11:36] Brandon_R: i'll just use both 
[11:37] drostie: Start with vim. When you get confused, try emacs. When you get even more confused, go back to vim and spend two months with it. Then you will be able to use vim. :D
[11:37] Brandon_R: lol
[11:37] Brandon_R: what are some cool large node.js projects?
[11:37] Brandon_R: like express or hookio but less well known?
[11:37] Brandon_R: i want to show them some love
[11:37] jetienne: or use an editor which is not from early 1980 :)
[11:37] mmalecki: jetienne: LIES
[11:38] Brandon_R: textmate on mac or sublimetext are some cool ones
[11:38] jetienne: true, vi is from early 70 :)
[11:38] mmalecki: Brandon_R: nide
[11:39] mmalecki: I mean, as a project to contribute to
[11:39] mmalecki: as a editor, you should use vim
[11:39] Brandon_R: do all of you guys use vim?
[11:39] jetienne: nah
[11:39] jetienne: i use a modern editor
[11:39] Brandon_R: i thought you guys seemed like a full ide environment kind people lol
[11:40] jetienne: i can adapt to non 1970 editor :)
[11:40] drostie: I've been using kate for a while now. It has some irksome properties but is otherwise good.
[11:40] Brandon_R: lol thought so :D
[11:40] Brandon_R: i like aptana studio because i can type node commands right into the built in terminal
[11:40] Brandon_R: but it's soo slow and java based
[11:41] drostie: Truly, we need an implementation of a windowing toolkit for Node, that we may build our own text editors in it. :x
[11:41] pandark_ has joined the channel
[11:42] AndreasMadsen_: I use cloud9 localhost because it is JavaScript.
[11:42] jetienne: drostie: do it in html
[11:42] kpko-fn: See, vim is fast because its very lightweight. Though you can use plugins to get some IDE features.
[11:42] jetienne: AndreasMadsen: is it opensource ?
[11:42] drostie: Actually, now that I think about it, Node is C++ and so you could probably just combine it with Qt. :x
[11:42] AndreasMadsen_: Yes
[11:42] Brandon_R: are you guys unixy like use the right tool for the job and have lots of tools or more windows like with a full environment in one program?
[11:42] jetienne: AndreasMadsen: cool i wasnt aware of that
[11:42] AndreasMadsen_: https://github.com/ajaxorg/cloud9
[11:42] Brandon_R: don't we have to pay for cloud nine?
[11:42] Brandon_R: c9.io?
[11:43] Brandon_R: or is the github version a slimmed down version
[11:43] drostie: honestly I'm a little of both. I don't like navigating through menus, for example.
[11:43] jetienne: vi is cool on a 8086 4mgz
[11:44] jetienne: but i got a much faster computer now :)
[11:44] AndreasMadsen_: c9.io is free if you go only public, like GItHub. The GitHub version is 100% free.
[11:44] mc_greeny has joined the channel
[11:44] drostie: The point is, nobody is recommending emacs because emacs is not a text editor -- it is an operating system with potential text editing applications. ^_^

[11:44] AndreasMadsen_: There has also been posts about getting the c9.io interface to the local (GitHub).

[12:05] TheJH: is there anything like the "network" tab of the chrome dev console yet?

[12:06] mmalecki: TheJH: at least I have it
[12:06] TheJH: mmalecki, :D
[12:06] TheJH: I mean, like, for nodejs :D
[12:06] kpko-fn: My regular expression is:    var testReg = new RegExp('\#[\{][a-zA-Z0-9]+[\}]', 'gi');
[12:07] kpko-fn: if i use testReg.exec(string) it only replaces the first occurence.. I thought the "g" modifier would fix that :/

[12:57] insin: trying to write webapps with the same codebase on both ends, lots of activity in this area recently, what with flatiron and all... just wish I had more time!

[12:59] p6 has joined the channel
[12:59] Brandon_R: what are you trying to acomplish?

[13:00] megalomix: Brandon_R, I wrote many controllers  in my case the first parameter is the name of the controller: example.com/controller
[13:00] megalomix: then... /controller/view
[13:00] megalomix: etc etc
[13:00] Brandon_R: separate it into modules
[13:01] Brandon_R: have 1 controller per verb
[13:01] megalomix: i always have to load a controllers, so if there are parameters (like: action, par1, par2) is not important...i always have to load the specific controller... THEN the controller will decide what method to call reading the parameters
[13:01] megalomix: verb ?
[13:01] bergie has joined the channel
[13:01] megalomix: yes... if someone ask: example.com/contact

[14:11] Brandon_R: :)
[14:12] TheJH: Brandon_R, this gives you a bunch of connections between in- and outgoing stuff
[14:12] Brandon_R: i like how node.js is divided into modules with node.js being really small
[14:12] Brandon_R: don't change that node.js guys :)

[14:26] benvie: I thought based on what I read you were referring to trying to communicate locally, like between nodes or something
[14:26] Brandon_R: that seems about right
[14:26] benvie: if it's remote then rpc is obviously fine
[14:26] megalomix: Brandon_R, good
[14:26] enmand has joined the channel
[14:26] Brandon_R: so you decided not to use the express-namespace module?
[14:26] benvie: but rpc isn't the right answer if you're working locally
[14:27] megalomix: Brandon_R, Yes because it doesnt improve the code (it is the same solution) I created that array an put the modules (contrllers) inside.

[14:27] gripir: hi, a good editor for writng web based stuff (javascript, html, css, maybe jade highlighting)
[14:27] gripir: I mean  ... I am looking for a good editor ...
[14:27] gripir: ;)
[14:28] erichynds has joined the channel
[14:28] devaholic: depends what os you use
[14:29] FeloniousHam: sublime text is great
[14:29] FeloniousHam: $60 is crazy though
[14:29] Brandon_R: i love sublimetext
[14:29] Brandon_R: it is the textmate for linux :)
[14:30] Brandon_R: but Vim + Terminal will always rock
[14:30] FeloniousHam: :)
[14:30] marcello3d: gripir: webstorm
[14:30] Brandon_R: if you want a full ide try aptana
[14:30] FeloniousHam: ST is just so pretty
[14:30] FeloniousHam: (and fast)
[14:30] benvie: actually
[14:30] Brandon_R: aptana's python module can work on jade/stylus
[14:30] marcello3d: it has decent node.js support
[14:30] benvie: ST2 is for all of em ;)
[14:30] benvie: we need a sublimetext written in all JS though
[14:30] Brandon_R: what do you guys do?
[14:30] benvie: just because
[14:30] insin: Sublime Text is lovely, using it in anger for the first time since yesterday
[14:30] gripir: atm im using aptana
[14:31] Brandon_R: are you guys more of the full ide guys
[14:31] gripir: but it is slow imho
[14:31] benvie: we need node and chromium built together as a desktop app
[14:31] Brandon_R: or right tool for the job?
[14:31] Brandon_R: sublimetext to write js
[14:31] Brandon_R: terminal to run node
[14:31] Brandon_R: browser to view it
[14:31] benvie: and an editor written entirely in javascript where everything is scriptable immediately
[14:31] marcello3d: Brandon_R: full ide ftw
[14:31] benvie: ST2 is close
[14:32] Brandon_R: yep
[14:32] marcello3d: refactoring, structural search/replace, interactive debugging, you develop a lot faster
[14:32] Brandon_R: we need a good quality open source editor
[14:32] AndreasMadsen: benvie like cloud9
[14:32] benvie: well sort of
[14:32] insin: sublime text is even a bit of a step up for me - I used to use something which was pretty much list list of open windows and syntax highlighting
[14:32] Brandon_R: sublimetext/textmate but open source and free :)
[14:32] benvie: using a lot of the same stuff cloud9 does
[14:32] insin: I find IDEs are just really flaky for JS
[14:32] marcello3d: textmate is terrible :(
[14:32] marcello3d: insin: have you tried intellij/webstorm?
[14:32] benvie: but integration with the local desktop and system is the missing part
[14:32] Brandon_R: what is your os?
[14:32] Brandon_R: Archlinux + Windows Vista here
[14:33] benvie: windows of course so I can go outside and die usually
[14:33] benvie: but node cares for windows, it has a heart
[14:33] insin: s/IDES/free IDES/ :-)
[14:33] benvie: I am so done with anything built in Java re: intellij/webstorm
[14:33] marcello3d: insin: do you have a free computer? a free desk? a free chair? free lunch?
[14:33] Brandon_R: i am amazed that we don't have a free open souce ide similar to st ot tm
[14:34] benvie: holy shit does it perform poorly, not even bringing my dislike of the language itself
[14:34] shenlok has joined the channel

[14:34] megalomix: bye bye
[14:35] Brandon_R: cya
[14:35] benvie: I got a full intellij license while working on the project from hell a while ago and I don't care because it blows up my computer if I try to use it
[14:35] Brandon_R: what is webstorm programmed in?
[14:35] marcello3d: benvie: that sucks. never had a problem with it
[14:35] Brandon_R: java or c++?
[14:35] benvie: it's java
[14:35] Brandon_R: awwwwwww
[14:35] FeloniousHam: I'm fond of the Eclipse variants (Aptana)
[14:35] marcello3d: don't hate =P
[14:35] benvie: all of their stuff is java and it sucks mega ass on windows at least
[14:35] Brandon_R: is it fast
[14:35] insin: I couldn't care less what a tool is written in if it's a good tool
[14:35] benvie: I mean the featureset is great
[14:35] marcello3d: it's plenty fast, faster than eclipse
[14:35] benvie: but it performs poorly to the point of being unusable
[14:36] marcello3d: benvie: what kind of computer?
[14:36] Brandon_R: what does ryan use?
[14:36] Brandon_R: is the question we should be asking
[14:36] benvie: on my computer with 12 gigs of ram and a quad core core i7
[14:36] marcello3d: I'm just on a standard macbookpro and it blazes
[14:36] marcello3d: until I run out of memory ;)
[14:36] benvie: well I don't know how it does on not Windows. But I know it does shitty on Windows
[14:36] benvie: and all java stuff does
[14:36] benvie: Eclipse stuff does better but it's noticably slower than other stuff
[14:36] marcello3d: weird
[14:37] marcello3d: that sounds like java 10 years ago
[14:37] benvie: yeah I seriously don't know
[14:37] benvie: I know how to fix these things, I can't make java IDEs not run shitty
[14:37] benvie: and I don
[14:37] marcello3d: yep
[14:37] benvie: I don't have any testimony from people on Windows that it's possible so
[14:37] Brandon_R: so what is the consesus?
[14:38] marcello3d: I've used intellij on vmware fusion on windows a mac
[14:38] marcello3d: and it as fine
[14:38] marcello3d: *was

[14:38] Dulak: I use vim/gvim on all oses
[14:39] marcello3d: alright
[14:39] marcello3d: ACTION goes back to his ide to code
[14:40] Brandon_R: is it hard to provide intellisense for javascriptA?
[14:40] benvie: it's fucking hard
[14:40] zomg: You can mess with objects in so many dynamic ways.. yeah
[14:40] FeloniousHam: you have no type information
[14:40] benvie: basicslly you just need to run the script in a vm alongside the editor
[14:40] Brandon_R: i might get sublime when i decide to go hardcore in node
[14:40] benvie: and inspect it in the actual context
[14:40] marcello3d: Brandon_R: webstorm basically shows a list of best guesses. it's relatively decent
[14:40] zomg: I wonder how WebStorm does it
[14:41] benvie: well this is what you do
[14:41] marcello3d: for all the html5/dom stuff it's spot on
[14:41] benvie: easy answer
[14:41] romanb has left the channel
[14:41] zomg: I guess they've implemented some kind of algorithm which tries to figure out it based on what they can be reasonably sure about
[14:41] benvie: just run the code alongside
[14:41] benvie: and inspect it in a live vm
[14:41] Brandon_R: it probably just does a regex for function [a-z0-9]*
[14:41] zomg: Brandon_R: It's smarter than that
[14:41] marcello3d: Brandon_R: it's a bit more advanced than that
[14:41] benvie: you can't use any kind of text based inference
[14:41] Brandon_R: :D
[14:41] Brandon_R: ik
[14:41] zomg: it can guess object props from its prototype etc.
[14:41] marcello3d: it has an AST understanding of your code, and it will look at property names in the same file and things like that
[14:41] benvie: I'm pretty sure webstorm runs the code to some level in a sandbox to do it
[14:42] zomg: eg. if you have some object called Foobar and then do var x = new Foobar(), it's capable of figuring out what was in Foobar.prototype
[14:42] benvie: you csn't really otherwise
[14:42] benvie: how about this
[14:42] zomg: Yeah
[14:42] marcello3d: benvie: I don't think it does, actually
[14:42] subbyyy has joined the channel
[14:42] marcello3d: benvie: because it supports autocomplete on stuff that you couldn't know without hitting all code paths
[14:42] Brandon_R: i love dynamic languages

[14:43] zomg: They might even tell you what they do, at least they seem quite open about certain things
[14:43] benvie: how does an IDE that doesn't run the code know what that does. What if I assigned a bunch of functions and defaults to it
[14:43] marcello3d: afk
[14:43] benvie: what if I use that for the prototype for my entire app
[14:44] ttt-- has joined the channel
[14:44] FeloniousHam:  qq:  I upgraded from 0.4.12 to 0.6.4.  require("./file") doesn't appear to work

[14:45] FeloniousHam: even though it's in the directory I'm launching node

[14:46] Brandon_R: not sure
[14:46] benvie: var wtf = { toString: function(){ return 'fun' } }; var o = {}; o[wtf] = "broken ides";
[14:46] FeloniousHam: but the syntax is the same
[14:46] Brandon_R: good lord
[14:46] FeloniousHam: (as 0.4)
[14:46] jacobrask: Is it considered Evil to extend Object.prototype even with non-enumerable methods?
[14:46] unomi has joined the channel
[14:47] Brandon_R: do you guys think javascript should be standardized or is this one of the strengths of js?
[14:47] benvie: depends where you expect the code to live
[14:47] benvie: it's not evil if you expect to control the end context
[14:47] jacobrask: so for my own app it's fine but probably not in an npm module..
[14:48] benvie: javascript has been standardized mostly, as of ES5, and is moreso in ES6
[14:48] benvie: yeah
[14:48] benvie: for your own thing, it really isn't bad
[14:48] jacobrask: but that's basically more of the argument against using globals at all rather than specifically extending Object.prototype
[14:48] jacobrask: which is a valid argument too and related
[14:48] benvie: the complaints come from two things: uncontrolled client environments, and when its being included for libraries to be used by other people
[14:48] benvie: well when you say globals
[14:49] benvie: until recently there wasn't any kind of official description of being able to have multiple separate contexts where there's unique natives
[14:49] benvie: like editing Object.prototype in one place doesn't edit it everywhere
[14:49] jacobrask: there is now?
[14:49] benvie: in that environment
[14:49] benvie: there is, for ES6. Node up to now has had hacked methods of doing
[14:50] jacobrask: Ok
[14:50] benvie: isolates in V8 do that very well
[14:50] Brandon_R: hey guys
[14:50] benvie: for ES6 there's official language descriptions of that kind of separation
[14:50] jacobrask: I haven't looked into that, still running 0.4.12
[14:50] Brandon_R: how do i learn all this shit?
[14:50] Brandon_R: like how to hack prototype and stuff
[14:50] jacobrask: ok cool
[14:50] Brandon_R: is there a javascript book that i can buy where i can learn more advanced js?
[14:50] benvie: mm well learning is a process
[14:51] benvie: if you want advanced js
[14:51] Brandon_R: yeah
[14:51] jacobrask: Brandon_R: take a look at http://eloquentjavascript.net
[14:51] jacobrask: excellent book
[14:51] benvie: https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/es-discuss/ go there every day
[14:51] Sorella has joined the channel
[14:51] benvie: https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/es-discuss/2011-November/thread.html
[14:51] benvie: but you need to know the language well before you can really get much out of it
[14:51] Brandon_R: cool i can read it online
[14:51] benvie: I'm not a book person...
[14:52] benvie: and on the internet a book is out of date a month before it's published
[14:52] jacobrask: Eloquent JavaScript has a little built in console which is nice for the code examples
[14:52] jacobrask: benvie: EJ is continously updated, and open source
[14:52] benvie: yeah it's as good as they come
[14:52] benvie: just depends what level he meant by 'advanced'
[14:53] benvie: my perspective is skewed

[14:55] benvie: there's two separate pieces
[14:55] nils_r has joined the channel

[14:57] Brandon_R: i will read the entire thing thanks
[14:57] blup has joined the channel
[14:57] jacobrask: btw, I've begun to use this style to define exportable functions: myFunc = exports.function = function() {}  to avoid having multiple declarations, are there any drawbacks of that? I haven't seen it elsewhere
[14:57] benvie: people tend to learn language and programming fundamentals when say they're getting a computer-science degree. And the theoretical problems, individual language problems, and then finally implementation problems are tackled separately
[14:57] jacobrask: er myFunc = exports.myFunc = ..
[14:57] npa: is there a maximum amount of objects a datastore can/should contain?
[14:58] Brandon_R: i have a question
[14:58] benvie: but it's hard to find that kind of separation in this age of web stufff
[14:58] Brandon_R: is there a maximum amount of events that is can throw before node.js starts getting slow
[14:58] Brandon_R: like what is the average
[14:58] benvie: node has a hardcoded error when an event is hitting 10 listeners that you specifically need to override
[14:58] Brandon_R: or is there basically no cost to emitting an event?
[14:58] npa: shit - wrong channel =)
[14:59] Brandon_R: woah 10 is the soft max?
[14:59] benvie: there's not much cost to emitting though non-zero
[14:59] benvie: the assumption is those listeners aren't doing nothing
[14:59] benvie: 10 for a single event, 10 separate listeners
[14:59] benvie: is a lot
[14:59] jacobrask: Brandon_R: that is per emitter
[14:59] lzskiss has joined the channel
[14:59] benvie: usually if you hit 10 it's because something went infinitely recursive or something
[15:00] jacobrask: per event rather
[15:00] Brandon_R: lol @ http://eloquentjavascript.net/appendix1.html
[15:00] blup_ has joined the channel
[15:00] benvie: if you're doing that then it's different
[15:00] benvie: but it's not the common use case
[15:00] benvie: an event essentially is just one function looping through an array calling other functions
[15:01] benvie: any given function call isn't very expensive
[15:01] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[15:01] benvie: more expensive than say accessing a primitive directly
[15:01] Brandon_R: i was thinking about have the active record pattern emit events like presave postsave onupdate for my models etc
[15:01] benvie: but not very expensive
[15:01] Brandon_R: is this a bad way of handling this problem?
[15:01] benvie: that's likely fine but it depends on what that really means
[15:01] benvie: is it a thousand times a second?
[15:01] Brandon_R: that way add-ons can be made easily
[15:01] jacobrask: benvie: I've seen other people extend Object instead of Object.prototype. There not really a difference between those imho though.
[15:01] benvie: there absolutely is
[15:01] jacobrask: agree?
[15:02] jacobrask: why
[15:02] benvie: Object is basically not very special
[15:02] benvie: it's a basically just a thing to put stuff on
[15:02] adamstantonvan has joined the channel
[15:02] benvie: Object.prototype is what every other object inherits from
[15:02] benvie: if I do
[15:02] jacobrask: but.. if the property on prototype is non-enumerable
[15:02] benvie: Object.hi = 'whatever'
[15:02] benvie: that does nothing
[15:02] benvie: if I do Object.prototype.hi = 'whatever'
[15:02] benvie: then every single object now has the 'hi' property
[15:03] benvie: instantly
[15:03] benvie: immediately
[15:03] xerox: it breaks einstein's relativity
[15:03] benvie: that's pretty different to me
[15:03] jacobrask: yeah.. but what if it's a very useful method with a specific name
[15:03] benvie: it's non-enumerable yeah
[15:03] benvie: but it's there
[15:03] benvie: just saying
[15:03] benvie: there's a way big different between extending Object and Object.prototype
[15:04] benvie: as in those two are completely separate and almost unrelated things
[15:05] benvie: really poor choice for javascript not making a clear distinction in naming [[prototype]] and prototype
[15:05] benvie: differently
[15:05] tanepiper: is node-inspector still recommended for debugging nodejs 0.6 apps? I need to track down some memory leaks in this app
[15:05] benvie: ([[prototype]] being __proto__ in webkit/mozilla)
[15:06] tanepiper: v8-profiler doesn't seem to have been updated in about a year
[15:07] rwasielewski has joined the channel
[15:07] benvie: oh hey sublimetext node addon dude
[15:07] benvie: I knew that name was familiar
[15:07] tanepiper: oh hey
[15:08] tanepiper: yea, unfortunately contract work is using up all my time just now - been given a heavy app to debug and try kill as many memory leaks :)
[15:08] benvie: we need to get that whole pipe exposing sublime's context to node thing going. Did a bit of research on transports for it recently
[15:09] tanepiper: yea, i have some test code around async subprocess stuff too, so better stdout 
[15:09] benvie: and yeah for that I think the only thing I've used is what you mentioned
[15:09] tanepiper: but it's just finding time to implement it
[15:09] jtsnow has joined the channel

[15:16] Brandon_R: what do you guys think about that ^^
[15:16] Brandon_R: also is this the accecpted way to code in the node.js community? http://nodeguide.com/style.html
[15:16] benvie: I forget who said that, but there's a time and a place..
[15:16] klovadis has joined the channel
[15:16] Brandon_R: felix said that
[15:16] insin: line 1: "There is no official document that governs the style of node.js applications"
[15:17] benvie: and the target for that statement has relevance in a specific context
[15:17] simenbrekken has joined the channel
[15:17] klovadis: hi there
[15:17] benvie: if you specifically run code in a private context and you actually know how the libraries you're using work then that statement has no weight
[15:18] klovadis: quick question: is there a gentle way to catch a socket.connect failure without throwing a critical error?
[15:18] TheJH: klovadis, listen on the error event of the socket
[15:18] benvie: and it's often not so even in less controlled places if you take the simple step of defining non-enumerable
[15:18] klovadis: TheJH if I listen, it won't throw?
[15:18] tanepiper: Brandon_R: if you are releasing your module, yes.  If it's a private code base - as long as it's documented, no
[15:18] djazz has joined the channel
[15:18] TheJH: klovadis, right
[15:19] benvie: the only way for there to be an issue in that case is if two separate things are vying to write the same named property

[15:19] AndreasMadsen_ has joined the channel
[15:19] klovadis: TheJH thanks a lot!
[15:19] TheJH: klovadis, "error" is a special event, if nobody listens to the event, it throws
[15:19] tanepiper: extending prototypes is basically the same as monkeypatching
[15:19] Brandon_R: have you guys seen how to be an open source gangster?
[15:19] insin: npm link and node_modules are frigging amazing to develop with. How many languages get that stuff wrong?
[15:19] klovadis: TheJH does this apply to all eventlistener instances?
[15:19] TheJH: klovadis, eventlistener?
[15:20] adtaylor has joined the channel
[15:20] benvie: it's afforded by the language and the reasons not to do it have a specific scope
[15:20] klovadis: TheJH socket inherits from the eventlistener class afaik
[15:20] benvie: and there's very useful applications of it for some uses
[15:20] klovadis: TheJH hmm I'll test that myself
[15:20] klovadis: TheJH but thank you about the sockets
[15:21] benvie: it can allow for some very fluent, readable, and terse code as well if you have the luxury of controlling the environment
[15:21] benvie: which you do in node usually
[15:22] benvie: if you can do require('vm') then you can do what you want and the only thing stopping you is convention or ignorance

[15:30] Renegade001 has joined the channel
[15:31] adtaylor: The default site for a Express.js app adds the routes as seperate modules. This is causing me issues with variable scope — currently with the User Model. How do people negotiate this? Store Models you may need in the session? 
[15:32] TheJH: Brandon_R, interesting concept if you have something that's large enough to be split in pieces
[15:32] joshsmith has joined the channel
[15:32] Brandon_R: :)
[15:32] Brandon_R: what are some good examples of apps written in hook.io that i can check out
[15:32] TheJH: Brandon_R, kohai
[15:36] Brandon_R: kool

[15:39] adtaylor: are all require's stored in mem? How inefficient is calling `User = mongoose.model 'User' ` in two different files?
[15:41] benvie: the compiled module will be stored in memory
[15:41] benvie: at which point running it again is as efficient as running any other function
[15:42] benvie: as long as this is the same originating node process

[15:44] Raynos: Brandon_R hook.io is pure win
[15:44] Brandon_R: got that right
[15:44] benvie: so basically it's fine since I assume you're not trying to do some multi-process stuff
[15:44] Brandon_R: breaking an app into modules is always the better way to go
[15:44] benvie: also Raynos I'm now seeing your name everywhere like you're stalking me
[15:44] benvie: stalker

[15:44] adtaylor: benvie: Thanks.
[15:44] Brandon_R: if you really look at all the big programming movements all they really come down to is breaking up a problem into modules
[15:45] Rob__: is there a standard way of wrapping an async call to make it sync?
[15:45] Brandon_R: object oriented programming, mvc all those
[15:45] Raynos: benvie: its because I am everywhere
[15:45] Raynos: its also because the internet is small
[15:45] Raynos: and we live in the same subset of the internet
[15:45] Brandon_R: the internet is bigger

[15:57] Raynos: the node.js tag : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/node.js is also worth checking out
[15:58] benvie: oh also I saw you had a thing for what was it
[15:58] benvie: DOM shimming for node?
[15:58] benvie: I'm working on a thing to make using dom.js more streamlined in node
[15:59] benvie: and it's pretty amazing to begin with
[16:00] gut4 has joined the channel
[16:01] Raynos: benvie: dom shim is for the client
[16:01] benvie: working on a better IDL->source conversion bit now to make it tweakable and then I'm going to make a module to load dom.js using node's tools instead of its current browser targeted build system
[16:01] Raynos: dom.js is pretty awesome :)
[16:01] benvie: oh nevermind then
[16:01] Raynos: I want a minimal dom4 module for node
[16:01] Raynos: to replace jsdom
[16:01] benvie: I've been focused on in node stuff
[16:01] jeromegn has joined the channel
[16:02] Raynos: Mainly build as a trade off between spec compliance and performance
[16:02] bogomips2_ has joined the channel
[16:02] benvie: dom.js apparently performs a lot better
[16:02] Raynos: Basically a small module thats the performant subset of the DOM
[16:02] benvie: and is almost 100% compliant as its original goal was an IDL compliant DOM host entirely in JS
[16:03] benvie: a lot of the overhead in other stuff comes from basically not being able to make efficient use of information hiding
[16:03] benvie: and being lazy
[16:03] pekim has joined the channel
[16:03] benvie: which is what you get from using Proxies and WeakMaps and whatnot
[16:04] Raynos: i might swap jsdom out for dom.js
[16:04] Raynos: in trinity, and see if I get speedup
[16:04] benvie: it works in node now but you have to use the build system it has currently and I'm so lazy I'll spend 10 hours to save 5 minutes
[16:05] benvie: it builds all the files into one gigantorific file, including the idl->js automated conversion
[16:05] benvie: good for browsers but not node
[16:05] benvie: doesn't make use of vm
[16:05] benvie: so that's my goal
[16:05] benvie: the IDL part itself I'm doing as a separate module because it's really useful for a lot of things
[16:06] Brandon_R: do u guys use yui in node?
[16:09] tbranyen: nope
[16:09] tbranyen: i use backbone tho

[16:58] isaacs: ugh, that's a huge project.
[16:58] mmalecki: ACTION is a frontend ninja by night
[16:59] isaacs: maybe decide what you'd like to tackle first.

[17:01] aaronmcadam has joined the channel
[17:01] npa has joined the channel
[17:02] benvie: like node toolbox looks nice and all but it's not actually any more useful than npm itself for searching
[17:03] isaacs: benvie: not everyone loves the cli.
[17:03] isaacs: benvie: i do
[17:03] benvie: yeah no I know, I don't particularly either though I've learned to use it. But I see a site like node toolbox that obviously had effort put into usability
[17:03] bergie has joined the channel
[17:04] benvie: and there's no way to do anything more than the same search you do in npm. Granted, not on a command line
[17:04] isaacs: mmalecki: probably merge this in first: https://github.com/maxogden/npmjs.org/commit/da53d6bec963483884d9749e80a27eab5fe6a240

[17:05] mmalecki: isaacs: can I use director for routing stuff?
[17:05] isaacs: mmalecki: it's not a node program
[17:05] benvie: it's not hard because I did it with like 10 lines of code using npm as a module on the command line so it just surprises me when it's not done
[17:05] isaacs: mmalecki: if it's a purely client-side lib, i kinda don't care.
[17:05] mmalecki: isaacs: it is
[17:05] isaacs: doesn't it already use sammy that has that stuff?
[17:06] isaacs: or are you suggesting a full-on rewrite?
[17:06] mmalecki: isaacs: yeah, kinda
[17:06] jimmysparkle has joined the channel
[17:06] benvie: of npm's repo client code?
[17:06] isaacs: if you're going to change the look of the UI considerably, can i weigh in on it?  i do care about that.  what's there now is pretty crap, but we should go in a good direction, not just have lots of changes that get un-changed later.
[17:06] chrisvwebdev has joined the channel

[17:07] blackrock has joined the channel
[17:07] benvie: yeah I was going to say, the site itself could use some more directly imported love from npm itself
[17:07] blackrock: Is it _really_ scalable?
[17:07] isaacs: i think 2012 is going to be the year of npm's speed and web presence.
[17:08] benvie: I don't recall how it looks on linux, but search modules using npm on windows sucks because of how terribly the columns don't end up being columsn
[17:08] benvie: even at max width
[17:08] benvie: that's the thing that made me anger out a mini thing for searching
[17:09] marcello3d: isaacs: what's your opinion of nodetoolbox or whatever it's called?

[17:09] Brandon_R_: which seat are you sitting in?
[17:10] dgathright has joined the channel
[17:10] benvie: it looks nice but it's only feature really is that it gives a semi-usable list of modules broken down by category while supplying no useful filtering or searching which is what is actually needed with 5000 modules
[17:10] isaacs: Brandon_R_: i'm the dude with the curly hair and the red and blue shirt
[17:10] Brandon_R_: lol
[17:10] isaacs: the funny lookin one
[17:10] Brandon_R_: you guys should do another one
[17:10] Brandon_R_: like for each version
[17:10] benvie: I need to know modules updated recently, modules that are popular (and recently), modules that are similar to X by tag or something else
[17:10] xerox: you guys should do one another
[17:10] benvie: and pulling in data from github is a good plus

[17:11] benvie: how do i see more than those top 10 popular modules
[17:11] benvie: on node toolbox
[17:11] Brandon_R_: and do you guys put up all the videos? i think there are some missing
[17:11] benvie: and how do I see popular modules for a given search
[17:12] isaacs: Brandon_R_: and the speaker is mikeal
[17:12] Brandon_R_: i love watching nodejs conferences sadly i can't visit any of them :(
[17:12] benvie: and filter by updated since node 0.6.x
[17:12] benvie: those aren't just wants, modules literally don't work unless they've been updated since then, so anything that can't do that for me is useless
[17:13] jetienne has joined the channel
[17:13] Cromulent has joined the channel
[17:13] benvie: npm has an absolute buttload of way outdated modules so it's kind of a critical thing
[17:14] pokoli has joined the channel
[17:14] isaacs: benvie: sorting by last updated would be good
[17:14] isaacs: or maybe just putting it in the cli search results
[17:15] isaacs: i show keywords in there, and that's kind of useless.
[17:15] isaacs: (though, good to search on programmatically)
[17:15] benvie: yeah. I should clean up what I did and package it up as a utility for whatever
[17:15] davidascher has joined the channel
[17:15] benvie: just basic stuff like filter by node version (date and specified number), etc.
[17:16] Brandon_R_: where are all the nodeconf videos?
[17:16] benvie: it's not advanced or anything, just boilerplate kind of stuff

[17:24] quackquack: why does node, upon encountering a circular require, just pass a {} instead of throwing an error???
[17:24] benvie: is that bad?
[17:24] benvie: er
[17:24] Lingerance: quackquack: Because it hasn't finished loading the file.
[17:24] benvie: it doesn't pass the module?
[17:25] isaacs: quackquack: that object is the exports object
[17:25] isaacs: it'll get filled in once that other module hsa a chance to fill it in
[17:25] isaacs: it's fine
[17:25] quackquack: isaacs: ah, ok. makes is harder to debug >< 
[17:25] zomg: Socket.io really could use better docs... I'm again just going with educated guesses on how it works..
[17:25] quackquack: though i guess its easy if i could just remember
[17:25] zomg: :P

[17:26] quackquack: isaacs: k, ty
[17:26] appinsanity-mike: My background is C so I'm not sure what the best practice is here for node.js. If you are reading and processing a file stream character by character (lexer/parser) what is the fastest way to buffer/stream the processed characters?
[17:27] josh-k has joined the channel
[17:27] benvie: you should have your lexer be an event emitter that emits at discrete points that can be used by another thing to consume
[17:27] isaacs: appinsanity-mike: the fastest way is to do it by byte, not by char
[17:28] isaacs: appinsanity-mike: use a Buffer object, never convert to a string
[17:28] benvie: oh input not output
[17:29] isaacs: appinsanity-mike: a Buffer is a bit like a C string, which typically contains utf8-encoded data.  when you convert to a string, it'll give you characters, not bytes, and there's a copy there into v8's heap

[17:41] pquerna: wooo isolates
[17:41] pquerna: this is me, so excited.
[17:41] benvie: it's what I need to run chromium as a node module
[17:42] benvie: that is exciting to me
[17:42] benvie: does other stuff too

[17:46] isaacs: i thought isolates were just the shared-nothing, but it's still up to you to make a thread and whatnot?
[17:47] benvie: oh yeah definitely but it facilitates crosstalk between different implementations
[17:47] benvie: before it was...I'm not going to say impossible but really really hard and I didn't finish it. Now it's 80% built in
[17:47] benvie: if you can run in the same thread
[17:48] benvie: er process
[17:48] AndreasMadsen has joined the channel
[17:49] benvie: you need to reconcile the differences between event loop implementations, chromium's significant use of ipc, etc.
[17:50] benvie: but there's an api and it's doable

[17:52] benvie: v8 itself automatically aligns itself with any existing v8 running in the current thread so you just need to make sure whatever the secondary user of v8 is can accept not being in control of allocations, or give it a way to allocate the important things
[17:52] benvie: process argg
[17:52] bpierre: Brandon_R_: Yes, I will restart my project after having read some articles on the subject. Thank you!

[18:05] Brandon_R_: what color scheme are you using?
[18:05] dgathright has joined the channel
[18:06] benvie: I use the based one but heavily modified for darkness
[18:06] benvie: the theme files are also json and pretty easy modify though I don't know what theme engine this uses and it's definitely not following how css works
[18:07] benvie: I just make everything dark and I have my customized javascript and c and c++ syntax files and theme
[18:07] benvie: because I need max colors

[18:08] herbySk has joined the channel
[18:09] Brandon_R_: very nice
[18:09] Brandon_R_: sublime text is definitly my editor of choice
[18:09] Brandon_R_: will probably need to test it a little more before i buy it though
[18:10] Brandon_R_: how long have you been using it?
[18:11] benvie: I've played with sublime text 2 since like the spring or so. It wasn't quite there yet though to replace Textmate (e-texteditor clone on windows) until a couple months ago
[18:11] patcito has joined the channel
[18:11] benvie: the syntax highlighring and custom language stuff is a dealbreaker or maker for me
[18:12] benvie: I've customized them so much that I can tell what kind of code I'm looking at by the color patterns so I'm lost if that doesn't work
[18:12] MatthewS has joined the channel
[18:12] Brandon_R_: i wonder why doesn't the textmate people make a cross platform solution
[18:12] Brandon_R_: it's in demand
[18:12] benvie: when ST2 finally supported those correctly that was it
[18:12] benvie: it's not people, it's a guy
[18:13] benvie: same for etextiedotr
[18:13] benvie: and there's something about people who make code editors and disappearing...
[18:14] socketio\test\62 has joined the channel
[18:14] Brandon_R_: lol
[18:14] benvie: aptana started supporting the level of customization (and format eventually) provided by these but it didn't quite get there, and java runs like shit on windows (for me anyway) so I gave up on that
[18:14] Brandon_R_: but since it's not free they have incentive to keep supporting
[18:14] benvie: and just kept using this thing that looks like ass and is basic but is also the most powerful there is
[18:14] benvie: and only just recently did sublime text 2 finally surpass it
[18:14] benvie: you'd think right?
[18:14] mmalecki: ACTION nerdrages at gui editors
[18:15] benvie: look up how long textmate 2 has beem "in development"
[18:15] benvie: and ot
[18:15] Brandon_R_: do you think vim should remove all that clutter?
[18:15] benvie: it's sadly funny how similar the windows clone fared
[18:15] benvie: vim apparently is doing good as is
[18:16] benvie: it doesn't need to change, new editors just need to exist and have people who will update them for people who don;t want vim
[18:16] benvie: ST2 is filling that niche now
[18:16] Brandon_R_: yep
[18:16] benvie: and doing a good job of it aside from requiring you to code your own gui basically
[18:17] benvie: at least you can
[18:17] Brandon_R_: how long has textmate 2 been in development?
[18:17] benvie: 3 years I think
[18:17] benvie: it's not, I mean
[18:17] benvie: it's just supposedly been
[18:18] benvie: that dude is on some island somewhere he bought, or dead
[18:18] Brandon_R_: lol
[18:18] Brandon_R_: how apple of you to say that
[18:18] benvie: just sayin,I don't use macs and I know

[18:21] benvie: blowing up the world of code editing
[18:21] Brandon_R_: cloudide
[18:21] Brandon_R_: what needs to happen is
[18:22] benvie: cloud9 is say an implementation, maybe you can plug into it
[18:22] Brandon_R_: i need to learn javascript
[18:22] tanepiper: Also, sublime's code completion isn't perfect - seems to have problems with . auto completions
[18:22] benvie: but you need native access and you need to be able to run locally conveniently
[18:22] Brandon_R_: autocomplete sucks on st
[18:22] benvie: sublime's completion is downright retarded sometimes, like it's trying to be too clever
[18:22] tanepiper: Cloud9 is good, but i've switched from it to ST
[18:22] Brandon_R: same here
[18:22] benvie: like if i type 4 letters I definitely don't want to match 4 completely separate letters
[18:22] willwh: ST?
[18:23] Brandon_R: how long have you been using st
[18:23] tanepiper: Sublime Text 2
[18:23] benvie: that was the idea that spurred me down this ridiculously long path I've been on
[18:23] tanepiper: couple of months now, as my main javascript and PHP editor (I do Drupal work during the day)
[18:24] Brandon_R: cool
[18:24] tanepiper: it is the spiritual successor to both E and Textmate, and superior to Gedit
[18:24] benvie: the idea of building a code editor with access to the native stuff, but using the powerful GUI apis that just come standard in a browser context, without being trapped in it
[18:24] Brandon_R: what do you program c++ in?
[18:24] tanepiper: I don't, but if I did - Visual Studio.  I is still probably the best C/C++ IDE
[18:24] tanepiper: *it
[18:24] benvie: c++ syntax highlighting sucks ass in evertyhing I've used so I had to edit the hell out of that and the C language files and it's still not sufficiently colorful for me
[18:25] tanepiper: http://kodapp.com/ looked so promising, but it seems to have died :(
[18:25] benvie: visual studio is nice but the overhead associated with it ends up being a detriment
[18:25] wojohowitz has joined the channel
[18:25] context: tanepiper: id agree
[18:25] benvie: yeah that happens usually, and also that was largely based on using Cocoa
[18:25] tanepiper: it used nodejs as it's underlying toolset, so all scripting was JD
[18:25] tanepiper: *JS
[18:25] benvie: it's super awesome that doing these things is easy on macs
[18:25] benvie: except I don't use or like macs

[18:26] Phlogistique: context: a problem?
[18:26] benvie: I have linux running most of the time along with windows
[18:27] context: i guess not. i find windows to be more of a pain when developing than a help

[18:27] Brandon_R: or a really good apartment
[18:27] context: brandon_r: same except my 4S is my ipod
[18:27] benvie: I don't know what the issue is fundamentally
[18:27] context: its... windows
[18:27] tanepiper: i don't own a mac, but i use them at work
[18:27] benvie: I went into both linux and os x with about the same experience with both
[18:27] benvie: and i wanted to stab babies when using mac os x
[18:27] tanepiper: which is why ST rocks because it works great on both
[18:27] benvie: I think it was 10.5
[18:28] context: benvie: why is that?
[18:28] benvie: and I've used 10.6
[18:28] No9 has joined the channel

[18:40] TheJH: benvie, huh, 5000?
[18:40] benvie: kidding
[18:40] chrisdickinson: isaacs: runforcover has been bumped to 0.0.2, removed expresso which was hiding in my node_modules. (sorry about that!)
[18:41] benvie: ;)
[18:41] isaacs: chrisdickinson: no problem, thanks!
[18:41] TheJH: benvie, that's a little bit less than the total number of npm packages :D
[18:41] chrisdickinson: no prob. glad it's seeing use :)
[18:41] benvie: that's what I was saying hah
[18:41] isaacs: benvie: npm install *?
[18:41] benvie: would say that work? that'd be a good dare
[18:41] isaacs: actually, due to conflicting dependencies, you'd get much more than 5k packages installed.
[18:42] isaacs: you'd get multiple copies of certain things.
[18:42] benvie: hah yeah like 10x that much
[18:42] jrbran has joined the channel
[18:42] isaacs: well… not 10x
[18:42] isaacs: but maybe double
[18:42] benvie: I wonder
[18:42] isaacs: a lot of them *would* share the top-level one
[18:42] benvie: some modules have no dependencies and some have 20
[18:42] TheJH: 20?
[18:43] benvie: how many modules does it take to get express and all of its submodules
[18:43] isaacs: benvie: right, but only *conflicts* would install a second time
[18:43] context: express doesn't really depend on that much
[18:43] benvie: yeah I guess I have no idea how many are outdated with a massive amount
[18:43] isaacs: benvie: npm install express; npm ls -p | grep express | wc -l
[18:43] isaacs: benvie: npm install express; npm ls -p | grep node_modules/express | wc -l
[18:44] isaacs: only 6
[18:44] benvie: that is kind of an issue though, just in general
[18:44] benvie: with how fast node's api has moved, stuff is outdated
[18:44] benvie: more modules on there will completely break than will work
[18:45] context: eh
[18:45] mmalecki: forever has 20 or so deps
[18:46] benvie: that's surprising

[18:47] benvie: yeah exactly
[18:48] mmalecki: actually, 39-25 deps
[18:48] mmalecki: so I guess it's 15 or so?
[18:48] benvie: lots of single purpose modules I guess
[18:48] benvie: small ones
[18:48] mmalecki: yeah
[18:49] mmalecki: most of them don't have any deps
[18:49] idefine has joined the channel
[18:49] chrisdickinson: isaacs: yeah, coverage makes tests sort of pokey :\
[18:49] benvie: I mean that's how I try to do it. There's modules for a lot of small target things that are useful. It gives that kind of erggg maybe I should just integrate this kind of feeling

[18:51] idefine: are there any common or good practices for pushing new code to a production server? graceful restarts?
[18:52] pquerna: we drain at a node at the load balancer, then kill -9 it.
[18:52] pquerna: less than ideal, but are worried about event loop bugs.

[18:56] idefine: pquerna: have you played around with cluster? it says it has graceful restarting, but I haven't found any resources with people saying they're using that
[18:56] pquerna: we do not currently use cluster, we decided to wait till we finish 0.6 and experiment with the core feature if we need it.
[18:56] mmalecki: pquerna: I guess I should know, but what company is that?
[18:57] pquerna: rackspace
[18:57] mmalecki: oh, neato
[18:57] pquerna: s/we finish 0.6/we finish porting all our codebase to 0.6/

[18:58] Leemp2 has joined the channel
[18:59] pquerna: idefine: my biggest worry, and there have been related bugs in the past, is having an FD still in th event loop, preventing a restart from completeing.   Since we have decent scripting of our load balancers, its easy for us to drain out all our incming requests, and then kill it a minute later (yes, this does possibly kill any requests taking a long time, but the nature of our service is all requests are generally done in 1-2 seconds tops)
[18:59] jbpros has joined the channel
[18:59] pquerna: if your service was doing large file downloads or such, it could easily make sense to invest time in making true-graceful restarts work.

[19:06] idefine: pquerna: how are you draining requests? sending all future requests to another server till there are no more connections on a single machine then kill -9 and fire up the process again?

[19:32] benvie: compiled it last night, it's newer than the latest one
[19:32] benvie: maybe that's the problem
[19:32] isaacs: benvie: "newer than the latest one" <-- sur, but what version?

[19:33] isaacs: ok… that's probably not right

[19:37] benvie: from 0.6

[19:38] benvie: will try it with the stock one
[19:38] isaacs: the msi should install npm and node.  the EACCES error comes from AV scanning locking a directory that npm is trying to delete.  it's fixed in this pre-release: http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.6.4/node-v0.6.4-1-msav.msi

[21:27] Raynos: I mean, I dont want to hard code the path to the bin 
[21:27] insin: mmm... constructor check. Good old JS. I also love that "factory function" isn't a dirty word in JavaScript, as you can build custom constructors on the fly.
[21:27] isaacs: Raynos: nono, you don't have to
[21:27] isaacs: Raynos: where is npm itself installed?  you can do `npm blah blah` and it works?
[21:27] Raynos: Well I do because `npm install jitsu -g` and `jitsu` doesnt work out of the box
[21:28] Raynos: npm itself works
[21:28] isaacs: Raynos: `npm bin -g`
[21:28] isaacs: Raynos: that'll tell you where npm puts bin files

[21:48] Raynos: isaacs: it gives me a cb did not fire error ive been ignoring
[21:48] isaacs: ok, so, you have a busted copy of npm.
[21:48] isaacs: that should never ever happen
[21:48] willwh: Raynos: if you had a cmd prompt open
[21:48] isaacs: how did you install npm originally?
[21:48] willwh: changed your PATH

[22:36] xeodox: Whats the best form framework for node.js (work with forms, errors, etc)
[22:36] joshsmith: I can't generalize this well
[22:36] xeodox: form module*
[22:37] joshsmith: xeodox: what framework do you use?
[22:37] p1d_ has joined the channel
[22:37] xeodox: i use express right now, but my forms are still pretty bare-bones
[22:37] xeodox: In Django, there were form validation, re-filling forms after submission, etc.
[22:37] ryanrolds: joshsmith: I don't have any public examples (all work code), but if you have question just ask.
[22:38] joshsmith: xeodox: Express has connect middleware
[22:38] joshsmith: just use .bodyParser()
[22:38] joshsmith: and then you can listen for things like req.body.image (for a multipart form)
[22:39] joshsmith: ryanrolds: would it be possible for you to private gist a really abstracted out example?
[22:39] joshsmith: I'm just not sure how to generally access my own modules and use those functions
[22:39] xeodox: joshsmith: when people submit a regular form, i want a module that can validate it, and if there are errors, spit it back out so that the template fills the form again automatically, stuff like that….does connect-form do that
[22:39] joshsmith: seeing an example would make all the difference
[22:40] ryanrolds: xeodox: If you keep the body object after you validate it, you can stuff the data back in to the form in your templates.
[22:40] joshsmith: yeah. also, check out toolbox.no.de to see if there's anything that suits your need
[22:40] xeodox: ryanrolds: so i should just manually do it, right?
[22:40] joshsmith: xeodox: probably best
[22:41] xeodox: thanks guys
[22:41] ryanrolds: xeodox: Pretty much. Node doesn't frameworks that take ALL of the work out of your lap. I hope it stays that way. ;)

[23:39] Brandon_R: books shouldn't be written about html5
[23:39] Brandon_R: it changes before the first one is even sold
[23:39] Brandon_R: what we need is a wiki where everyone can update it
[23:39] mmalecki: Brandon_R: that's why they are being written XD
[23:39] mmalecki: to make new books

[23:56] cmr: Brandon_R: I generally do not purchase books, but one thing that is superior on paper is "pocket guides" or references. The HTML and CSS ones I bought about a year ago covered html5 and it hasn't changed much.
[23:56] Brandon_R: how do you make good looking html5 + css3 designs - are there any books on that
[23:57] Brandon_R: like web 2.0 colors, typeography etc
[23:57] Brandon_R: not semantics and structure
[23:57] cmr: I took a design class and it helped a lot.
[23:57] cmr: "web 2.0 colors" is the entire color space of rgba (although I use hsl myself)
[23:58] cmr: It's something to be learned through practice, IMO, and not through a book.
[23:59] cmr: (Not the answer you wanted to hear, I'm sure)
