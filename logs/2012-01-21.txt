[00:25] AvianFlu: Leemp_offsite, we usually use a static server called ecstatic with flatiron

[00:29] thriple has joined the channel
[00:30] coderarity: just don't do empty directories with directory listings and you'll be fine
[00:30] Leemp_offsite: I've actually been rather surprised to find Flatiron, and then find that it doesn't use Require.js. I (a js & node beginner) assumed that many frameworks would be using RequireJS as it *looked* to better support client/server usage
[00:31] coderarity: nah, node.js already has require stuff
[00:31] Leemp_offsite: coderarity: Right, but it's sychronous and doesn't support web paths, does it? (Eg, client)
[00:32] panosru: coderarity: I find node's require very limited against require.js
[00:32] coderarity: yeah, but a lot of server libraries don't need that
[00:32] panosru: Leemp_offsite: you can use browserify
[00:32] joelmob has joined the channel
[00:33] panosru: coderarity: yes but node.js require method I believe need's a tune up it still misses some features
[00:33] panosru: setting path mapping or base path I think is something that could be useful for many
[00:33] Leemp_offsite: coderarity: True, i've just been looking for frameworks that blur the line between client and server, and having to use, say, require.js on the client, and commonjs on the server, seems.. odd
[00:33] Leemp_offsite: (Again, i'm just inquiring. I am a beginner :) )
[00:33] rauchg has joined the channel
[00:35] coderarity: Leemp_offsite: well, that's a needless dependency, it kind of forces people who use the library to use require.js
[00:35] coderarity: you can still use require.js for your project

[00:36] Leemp_offsite: That was my next question, does RequireJS tend to play nicely with frameworks not specifically designed for it? (Eg, Flatiron with Plates/Directory/etc)
[00:37] coderarity: Leemp_offsite: you should still be able to use the require function like normal
[00:37] coderarity: i think it uses define for everything, but i don't use it myself

[03:09] secoif: Agree.
[03:09] dmnd: ugh, left the room by accident. did anyone try to answer me?
[03:10] secoif: dmnd `npm help faq`
[03:10] SubStack: dmnd: nope, but in just a sec
[03:10] SubStack: a local ./node_modules directory is awesome because when you update a package dependency you update the dependency for just one project at a time
[03:10] SubStack: and so you can upgrade packages without having to worry about breaking every other module on the system that depends on the same library
[03:11] WRAz: @SubStack: so ... I'm going to pass an object over dnode that is actually an event emitter... on and emit wouldn't be callable on the remote ya?
[03:11] SubStack: and it's really great for subdependencies because you can bump a version without worrying about breaking the other modules you depend on that happen to depend on the same package
[03:11] dmnd: maybe my use case is weird - I'm writing a small script but I wanted to require underscore for conveneicne. But it seems to do that I need to also end up with package.json or check in a node_modules direcotry too?
[03:11] SubStack: because each dependency resolves to the most local node_modules directory

[03:11] SubStack: it is seriously the best thing ever
[03:12] SubStack: takes some getting used to though
[03:12] dmnd: I was trying to use jake (as a replacement for rake)
[03:12] SubStack: dmnd: you can do a global install for cli tools with npm that will manage the node_modules for you and set up a symlink in your $PATH
[03:12] kenperkins has joined the channel
[03:13] dmnd: seems heavily recommended against, though
[03:13] dmnd: maybe I'll just stick with rake
[03:13] SubStack: not for cli tools
[03:13] SubStack: those are the exception to the everything local heuristic
[03:13] SubStack: WRAz: correct because on and emit are on the prototype chain and don't show up in Object.keys()
[03:14] SubStack: WRAz: but if you re-define on and emit then you can call them but beware of race conditions owing to the latency across the wire
[03:14] SubStack: WRAz: here is how I usually expose EventEmitters over dnode: http://substack.net/posts/9bac3e
[03:14] dmnd: SubStack: I understand I can node install -g jake underscore, but that doesn't let me require("underscore") unless I also modify $NODE_PATH?

[03:15] secoif: SubStack I squashed the fixes into the previous commit
[03:15] WRAz: thanks! so I'm working on an entity system where entities will be sent over the wire with properties only (no methods.. :( sorry not taking full advantage of dnode rpc !) but! they are all eventemitters
[03:15] SubStack: WRAz: because when you listen with .on() that listener might not be bound in time before events start coming down the wire
[03:15] WRAz: thats fine, they're mosting going to be emitting
[03:15] SubStack: but the approach in that article circumvents that issue
[03:15] WRAz: very rarely teh remote will listen.
[03:16] SubStack: oh yeah that should work fine then
[03:16] SubStack: secoif: hooray
[03:16] WRAz: when I'm further along I would be interested in showing you the high level design to see if I'm silly for using dnode in this way.

[03:16] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[03:17] SubStack: WRAz: also check out upnode if you're going to be having long-running dnode links between node processes
[03:17] SubStack: it keeps dnode sessions alive and restarts them when they go dark
[03:17] TooTallNate has joined the channel

[03:19] SubStack: sweet thanks!
[03:19] WRAz: because of the sheer number of libraries that you contribute that I use XD
[03:19] SubStack: I just presented to some folks today, seemed to go over pretty well

[03:20] WRAz: also, should I be worried about making thousands of dnode connections? (I have increased my file handlers/etc for the socket concerns)
[03:21] WRAz: but any concerns ony our end about dnode scaling at the 1k - 50k level ?
[03:22] SubStack: thousands!
[03:22] zeade has joined the channel

[03:23] WRAz: so in other words, no concern. XD
[03:23] secoif: SubStack as in a up.close()
[03:23] secoif: but from the other end
[03:23] litropy_ has joined the channel
[03:25] secoif: SubStack I should do that with middleware for sure, but I was wondering if that could/should be added to upnode itself
[03:26] secoif: SubStack also, built-in ping etc, perhaps it's a good idea to namespace them?
[03:26] secoif: SubStack so it is less likely to collide with methods users may already have
[03:27] SubStack: upnode already uses built-in ping
[03:27] SubStack: oh namespacing them?
[03:27] SubStack: if you have a ping function it seems like that should be for pings
[03:28] secoif: yeah so like upnode_ping or _ping or something, just to signify, hey this is something we provided
[03:28] SubStack: perhaps
[03:29] secoif: but yeah, what do you reckon about the ability for an upnode server to `close()` an upnode client
[03:31] SubStack: secoif: seems like a thing upnode could have
[03:31] SubStack: perhaps re-namespacing the ping into this.upnode.ping and then adding this.upnode.close
[03:31] mvrilo has joined the channel
[03:32] SubStack: with a fallback for old upnode clients to use this.ping for now that I'll take out later

[04:16] secoif: SubStack you want an alias for just ping? Do you think people have built functionality around that ping method being .ping? it seems like it's fairly internal to upnode…
[04:16] SubStack: secoif: I'm not worried about that, I'm worried about version mismatches
[04:17] dilvie has joined the channel
[04:17] secoif: ACTION doesn't understand
[04:17] SubStack: var pinger = remote.upnode && remote.upnode.ping || remote.ping
[04:17] SubStack: like that
[04:17] SubStack: if an old version of upnode connects to a new version of upnode then the ping locations will be out of sync and shit will break
[04:17] secoif: ahhh
[04:17] secoif: gotcha
[04:18] SubStack: then perhaps server.use(upnode.server) instead of upnode.ping
[04:19] SubStack: and upnode.server will add upnode.ping and upnode.close
[04:19] secoif: + any others
[04:19] SubStack: but upnode.ping should exist for a little longer
[04:19] SubStack: yes
[04:19] secoif: good idea

[04:30] WRAz: I have a connect webserver that I have dnode listening on but I still want to dnode.connect to it
[04:31] WRAz: this doesn't immediately work, so I assume there is something special I must do
[04:31] SubStack: use 2 .listen()s
[04:32] SubStack: .listen(app).listen(port)
[04:32] WRAz: so two different ports
[04:32] SubStack: no
[04:32] SubStack: 1 port
[04:32] secoif: WRAz no, app is a reference to your connect server, final port is the dnode port
[04:32] SubStack: 1 http server
[04:32] SubStack: yep
[04:33] WRAz: no no I mean I must use different ports

[04:35] WRAz: I was wondering since dnode is listening to the connect server and does some magic to include dnode and that communicates to the server magically, if it did more magic and you could dnode.connect to that same port
[04:35] WRAz: rather than listen on yet another port(meaning I'll need to define two ports in my config, one for the web interface and one for the dnode server)
[04:36] WRAz: which is okay,  but I did expect magic :D

[09:06] mange has joined the channel

[09:07] secoif: change it to io.connect('192.168.1.102:8888') and see how you ho
[09:07] secoif: go]
[09:07] secoif: go.
[09:07] disappearedng: yeah cool is there a better way? 
[09:07] secoif: it is the only way.
[09:07] stagas has joined the channel
[09:07] disappearedng: like I guess I can use reverse proxy in the future and have just io.connect /
[09:09] secoif: disappearedng do you want to set it up so you can test in one configuration then deploy to another?
[09:10] GrizzLyCRO has joined the channel
[09:11] LeMike has joined the channel
[09:11] secoif: disappearedng two options, set an ENV var that you switch depending on if it's in production or dev environments, and swap out the connection string depending on the value, or you could set an env var that IS the connection string, or you could simply create an entry in your hosts file that masquerades your intranet machine as the remote.
[09:12] secoif: disappearedng you can access env vars via process.env
[09:12] salva has joined the channel
[09:14] disappearedng: secoif: yeah sure well I can do that for sure
[09:14] disappearedng: but isn't the browser smart enough to substitute that for me? 
[09:14] disappearedng: I mean if I reverse proxy to allow nodejs to be served on /nodejs
[09:14] secoif: disappearedng what do you mean?
[09:14] disappearedng: then having just / will be sufficient depending on the source of the http server
[09:15] secoif: disappearedng doesn't sound like a good solution to me
[09:15] disappearedng: so now I have to change and I can't use / is because localhost (the domain which the static file is served) is not equivalent to localhost:8888 
[09:15] disappearedng: well I have done this in the past and it's generally how it's done on port 80 
[09:15] secoif: aren't you hosting it from some other machine? 
[09:16] disappearedng: you set up haproxy or use nginx to redirect traffic heading to /nodejs to localhost:8888 
[09:16] disappearedng: yeah 
[09:16] secoif: and what's wrong with just serving it from there?
[09:16] disappearedng: nothing 
[09:16] josh-k has joined the channel
[09:16] disappearedng: but then I have to change enviornment and stuff
[09:16] disappearedng: the most scalable way is to hardcode the url into the script
[09:16] disappearedng: with the url being just / 
[09:17] harthur has joined the channel
[09:17] hz has joined the channel
[09:17] disappearedng: anyway I gotta code thanks for the spot 
[09:17] secoif: I wouldn't do it that way but in your environment, if changing an env var is harder than setting up a proxy I guess go for it
[09:18] disappearedng: no you HAVE to change to proxy when you deploy
[09:18] disappearedng: you cannot expect external environemnt to have port 8888 or something opened

[09:27] secoif: disappearedng perhaps ask over in #socket.io
[09:27] disappearedng: well at the end of the day 
[09:28] disappearedng: socket.io renders in a browser 
[09:28] disappearedng: and the browser has that capaiblity which I mentioned to convert / to the url it fetched the static files from

[11:27] hipsters_ has joined the channel
[11:27] secoif: no, more like, battle hardened against all sorts of traffic plus easy to configure to do simple stuff like throttling, in nginx you just add config 'rate_limit: 3000' and you're done.

[13:21] megalomix: re: i have a loop i have to do many queries, i need to do this query ASYNC so i do the loop and inside it i use process.nextTick(check) where check is a function i defined that does the query
[13:22] megalomix: re: now is this a problem if i call process.nextTick()  2000 times ? (because it is inside a loop)
[13:22] _baton__ has joined the channel
[13:23] mAritz: megalomix: why are you doing that?
[13:23] megalomix: mAritz, to call all the queries 
[13:23] mAritz: best give us a gist so we can look at what you're trying to do.
[13:23] megalomix: instead of one by one
[13:23] megalomix: wrong ?
[13:23] chakrit: megalomix: what kind of "queries" ? I think most queries are already async to some extent.
[13:23] chakrit: yeah, example would help
[13:24] megalomix: yes mysql queries
[13:24] mAritz: why not just call the query? if they're async, they'll all be called first before any callbacks are handled
[13:24] tobmaster has joined the channel
[13:24] mAritz: and why are you doing 2000 queries in one loop? oO
[13:24] megalomix: guys this is my code: https://gist.github.com/1652764
[13:25] megalomix: mAritz, take a look at the code
[13:25] megalomix: line number 10 has the process.nextTick()
[13:26] chakrit: megalomix: I think you don't need line 10
[13:27] chakrit: just call check();
[13:27] chakrit: and personally I think node can handle lots of process.nextTick just fine
[13:27] chakrit: but if it's me I'll do some tests/benchmarks to be sure
[13:27] megalomix: ah ok perfect
[13:27] megalomix: i remove it
[13:27] megalomix: maybe mysql should be async
[13:27] megalomix: ok
[13:28] megalomix: thank you so much!
[13:28] chakrit: yeah, it's already async that's my point
[13:28] janekp has joined the channel
[13:28] megalomix: i just call check()
[13:28] chakrit: on line 13, that is
[13:29] chakrit: guys, any of you using node-fibers on heroku? wondering if there'll be any potential issues.
[13:31] mAritz: megalomix: also: if you can, don't define functions inside of loops. especially if your loop has 2000 iterations, because function declarations cost.

[17:37] megalomix: isaacs, could you give me an opinion obut this code? https://gist.github.com/1653361 my doubt regards the "stock" variable, because as you can see i'm using mysql module that does the queries async so if a "process" pass from check() to save() may the stock variable changes, so the other process that shuld be use "stock" may have a different stock value

[17:43] megalomix: https://gist.github.com/1653361
[17:43] isaacs: jojohess: yeah, works for me
[17:44] TheJH: megalomix, what do you want that stuff to do?
[17:44] megalomix: the "problem" is that mysql does the queries asynx so ad as you can se 20th line call load() 
[17:44] megalomix: ok the question is:
[17:44] megalomix: if there is a process that change the "Stock" variable (in the check() function)
[17:45] megalomix: then.... if there is another process between check() and save()
[17:45] grom358 has joined the channel
[17:45] megalomix: the save() function could read a different "stock" variuable (different value)
[17:45] rfvizarra has joined the channel
[17:45] TheJH: megalomix, no
[17:45] megalomix: so, how can i be sure that save() read the correct "stock" value
[17:45] megalomix: TheJH, no?
[17:45] megalomix: why?
[17:46] TheJH: megalomix, well, its value will stay the same
[17:46] TheJH: megalomix, it's a local variable in a closure
[17:46] TheJH: megalomix, and the only place where you set it is in load()
[17:46] Sembiance: Is there a way to download the entire NPM database? All of the package.json's ?  I'd like to create a tool that finds all modules that depend upon another.
[17:47] salty-horse: if "npm install" doesn't install dependencies of dependencies (or more...), why should I use it instead of "npm update"?
[17:47] Sembiance: Actually, come to think of it, if the NPMjs server dies a horrible death, are they doing good backups? :)

[17:48] isaacs: Sembiance: yes, the db is backed up regularly by multiple people.
[17:48] TheJH: megalomix, maybe I misunderstood your question?
[17:48] megalomix: TheJH,  but as you can see 20th line has load() call
[17:48] megalomix: may i wrote it wrong..
[17:48] isaacs: Sembiance: but also, you can replicate the db.  it's a couch: http://isaacs.couchone.net/registry
[17:48] Sembiance: salty-horse, TheJH, isaacs:  thanks :)
[17:48] TheJH: megalomix, oh, sorry
[17:48] megalomix: TheJH, I mean... load() change stock variable......ok but if i have a process between check() and save() when the save() callback will be called may the stock value changed

[17:51] TheJH: megalomix, but well, I don't know the context
[17:51] isaacs: megalomix: won't that result in the cb() being called multiple times?
[17:51] isaacs: megalomix: why not just do them all in parallel?
[17:52] dgathright has joined the channel
[17:52] megalomix: isaacs, how to chane the code to do it in parallel?
[17:52] megalomix: TheJH, why weird?
[17:52] megalomix: isaacs, cb() is a function that i have to call WHEN i finished the stocks
[17:52] TheJH: megalomix, ah, now I understand. I think you really should rename "done" to "maybeDone" or so :D
[17:53] RLa: which lib/module is should use for string interpolation?
[17:53] isaacs: megalomix: var cnt = stocks.length, errState = null ; if (cnt === 0) return cb(); stocks.forEach(function (stock) { processOneStock(stock, done) }); function done (er) { if (errState) return; if (er) return cb(errState = er); cnt --; if (cnt === 0) return cb() } }
[17:53] RLa: string templates*
[17:53] TheJH: RLa, coffeescript :D
[17:53] megalomix: isaacs, as you can see WHEN there are not other stocks i do: if (count == 0) return cb()
[17:53] isaacs: megalomix: then write "processOneStock" which just takes a single item

[18:00] RLa: you can try switch dns server
[18:00] jojohess: i've changed dns servers. tried 3 different ones
[18:00] RLa: unless your isp blocks custom dns servers
[18:01] jojohess: tried googles, my isp and Level3
[18:01] RLa: what if you try to access with curl -v
[18:01] jojohess: I think im gonna have to call my isp and complain.
[18:01] RLa: or will it just hang in the middle of request
[18:03] jojohess: "curl -v http://nodejs.org" hangs for like 30 seconds. Responded with "couldn't connect to host"

[18:05] megalomix: ok
[18:05] isaacs: jojohess: maybe you could try pointing your dns at google or opendns or something?
[18:05] megalomix: isaacs, i can use the forEach but as you can see i have two queries
[18:05] isaacs: jojohess: i've had a lot of issues with my isp from time to tim
[18:05] megalomix: processOnStock <---- here i can put those two queries?
[18:05] isaacs: megalomix: right, but what would you do if you could guaratnee that there's only *one* item in the array?
[18:05] isaacs: megalomix: write *that* function.

[18:18] megalomix: to avoid adding , function(){....} at the end of mysql.query function

Because of that, either AMD compliant forks exist, but for less popular libraries that don't support AMD, there's only Shim.  I was wondering if someone else has exper

[19:44] systemfault: Unfortunately.. it's the "overall" that counts.
[19:44] zomg: Yeah
[19:44] zomg: Java does pretty heavy optimization according to the guy though, it may run slower at first but it will get faster

[19:44] zomg: Although in my experience it does the complete opposite at least if your computer doesn't have a crapton of RAM :D

[19:45] systemfault: The only java application I had bad experiences with is eclipse.

[19:48] zomg: since it will be paged

[21:18] kenperkins: heat out means play tf2 all day right? heat up the house with the GPU :D

[21:18] isaacs: joelmob: `npm install` installs module deps
[21:18] TheJH: isaacs, in tap, can I say that I want to increase what I told "plan"? E.g. "oh, this test worked, I want to do another one that checks stuff more in-depth"?
[21:18] isaacs: joelmob: does pip or gems need a -d flag?
[21:18] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[21:18] isaacs: TheJH: you should probably just not use a plan then.
[21:18] joshsmith: has anyone in here used Jade to generate <select>'s?
[21:18] joelmob: maybe i was abit tired could have been -g i should have used
[21:18] isaacs: TheJH: just use t.end() when yoer' done
[21:19] isaacs: joelmob: no, you're not the first one.
[21:19] TheJH: isaacs, ooooh, thanks :)
[21:19] isaacs: joelmob: it seems like people do that a lot
[21:19] isaacs: TheJH: or, you could just skip the next one if the first one failed.
[21:19] mightym: cjk1969: yes, thx actually I'm reading an article … but I'm not sure what i need for my purpose :-S … maybe you can give me a hint. what I've done so far: i managed building a login which checks for the user if he has a session. this works. but I'm building a small app which works offline too and i need to update data on the server even if a session expired. should i only use cookies for this or a combination of both?
[21:19] isaacs: TheJH: so it's still a test, just not relevant if it fails.
[21:19] isaacs: (andnot run at all, if it's a child test)
[21:20] isaacs: joelmob: i'm curious if some other tool makes you do -d to install deps.
[21:20] joelmob: in play its --deps
[21:20] isaacs: joelmob: what's "play"?
[21:21] joelmob: if i remember right, play framework
[21:21] orlandovftw has joined the channel
[21:21] isaacs: interesting
[21:21] isaacs: TheJH: you could do something like this:  var x = t.ok(blah); t.test("more", {skip: !x.ok}, function (t) { ... })
[21:22] isaacs: TheJH: and keep the plan constant
[21:22] joelmob: im just beginning with node, just made that assumption that -d stands for install dependencies withouth looking closeley at docs
[21:22] isaacs: joelmob: that's interesting.
[21:22] isaacs: joelmob: thanks :)
[21:23] briancray has joined the channel
[21:24] cjk1969: mightym: Hm... you probably should separate your server-communication then, one for the users (with sessions) and one session-less for offline-communication.
[21:25] wizonesolutions has joined the channel
[21:25] mightym: cjk1969: ok and not like, "if session -> ok, if no session -> check if cookie exists?"
[21:25] grom358 has joined the channel
[21:26] cjk1969: mightym: But that depends on your apps architecture (where is the server - what does 'offline' mean?)
[21:26] alystair has joined the channel
[21:26] c4milo has joined the channel
[21:26] cjk1969: mightym: That's usually automatic, once you decide to store your sessions in cookies client-side.
[21:27] r04r has joined the channel
[21:28] mightym: cjk1969: offline means, the websites frontend works without an internet connection, if there is no connection the data is stored in the html5 local storage, but the next time there is an internet connection available the data is pushed to the server, that works also fine besides the session expired
[21:29] mightym: i could ask the user in this case to login again, but thats not very comfortable for him

[22:28] nuclearsandwich: Awesome, I'll talk to platform folks and figure out what's what. Thanks again isaacs. I have a feeling I'll owe you many beers as I begin playing with Node again. :)

[23:51] dtrejo: as long as downloading is happening async, there's no issue

[23:52] superjoe: dtrejo, I'm trying to understand what event-driven asynchronous I/O means. It seems like a contradiction
[23:52] dtrejo: totally
[23:52] dtrejo: superjoe: so there's a thread-pool that you never have to think about
[23:53] solidfusion_ has joined the channel
[23:53] superjoe: ohhh, ok. that explains everything.
[23:53] dtrejo: superjoe: and depending on the operation, one of those threads handles it. but also lotsa filesystem stuff is done asyncronously
[23:53] dtrejo: so between the thread pool and the async FS bindings, it works out
[23:53] superjoe: nice, that makes sense. thanks 
[23:54] dtrejo: short and mostly right explanation
[23:54] dtrejo: but definitely do some reading if you want more details
