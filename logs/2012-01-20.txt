[00:02] westc: guys can anyone help me understand how daemons work and what the & at the end of a process does
[00:02] westc: basically I'm running nodemon and sshd closes the connection and then nodemon keeps running
[00:03] mraxilus: daemons are basically applications that run in the background without user input
[00:03] westc: and I don't know how to get back to nodemon in the new ssh session therefore I end up having to kill it everytime and start a new instance of nodemon
[00:03] superlou has joined the channel
[00:03] mraxilus: the & after a command doesn't run a process as a daemon per say, but rather detaches it from the current terminal session
[00:04] grom358 has joined the channel
[00:04] superlou: I'm creating a one-page web app where the client is done in backbone.js, and I couldn't care less if the server can access the backbone models, but I can't find an example of this kind of structure.  Am I doing something dumb?
[00:04] whatadewitt_ has joined the channel
[00:04] mraxilus: you end up with the same effect, however daemons are programs designed to run as background applications were as you can use & to tell a program to essentially 'go away' as I like to call it.
[00:05] westc: so for example if I start a daemon, and then I can press enter and it goes to a new command "line"...how can i go reattach to the daemon process to see it populate my terminal with stdout, console.log or whatever
[00:05] westc: like in the case of mongod
[00:05] westc: once I start it
[00:05] grom358: ah.. noob question. I have written a script that has dependencies on jsdom and async modules. Is there way I can specify them so its easy for someone to install them with npm
[00:05] westc: and press enter
[00:05] westc: mongod is detached from my terminal
[00:05] mraxilus: You might want to take a look at the fg and bg commands
[00:05] isaacs has joined the channel
[00:06] mraxilus: But personally I would just use screen or byobu
[00:06] superlou: grom358, there's packages.js
[00:06] superlou: or something like that
[00:06] superlou: I tried to get it working and couldn't get the syntax quite right
[00:06] hackband has joined the channel
[00:06] westc: I like the fact that there are processes running in the background and aren't crowding ssh but I want to be able to somehow "reconnect" to the currently running daemon via the pid or something
[00:06] secoif: grom358 type `npm init` then `npm install --save async jsdom` then perhaps `npm publish`
[00:06] superlou: grom358, googling for packages.js isn't turning up anything, maybe i've got the wrong file name.  But there is something sort of like a dependency specifier
[00:07] secoif: superlou grom358  it's called package.json
[00:07] mraxilus: byobu is definately the way to go
[00:07] superlou: welp.  That's the closest I've been to an answer all day
[00:07] secoif: superlou grom358 `npm help json`
[00:07] ryanrolds_w: Guys, I have to say something.
[00:07] devongovett has joined the channel
[00:07] ryanrolds_w: I love you guys.
[00:07] grom358: yeah my script isn't a module is all
[00:08] secoif: grom358 it should be
[00:08] grom358: doesn't export anything
[00:08] mraxilus: run what ever programs you need in the byobu/screen session and you can simple press F6 to return to the normal ssh without exiting the running processes
[00:08] secoif: grom358 if it has an executable use preferGlobal
[00:08] mraxilus: I use it mostly for things like minecraft on my server
[00:08] westc: excellent!
[00:09] westc: thanks mraxilus
[00:09] secoif: grom358 eg, nodemon is a module, but it (probably) doesn't export anything
[00:09] mraxilus: no problem
[00:09] westc: I have no idea how people ssh without stuff like this
[00:09] amasad has joined the channel
[00:09] grom358: secoif: so I should make it a module still. Even though there nothing to import. Its a screen scraper script that dumps out information to a file
[00:09] rtgibbons has joined the channel
[00:09] theBrettman: npm vs git go!
[00:10] mraxilus: That's irrelevent, npm uses git...
[00:10] isaacs: theBrettman: i don't get the qeustion.
[00:10] superlou: you fools. SVN was perfect in every way
[00:10] superlou: HERETICS
[00:10] isaacs: theBrettman: you mean, checking in deps vs not checking in deps?
[00:10] charrly: I tried to install nodemon but it says i need to install with -g. when I do, i just get a bunch of errors.. anyone know why?
[00:10] theBrettman: ha
[00:10] theBrettman: I'm noob and didn't know npm uses git
[00:10] isaacs: or are you literally suggesting that you replace "git commit" with "npm publish"
[00:11] secoif: grom358 you should make it a module still
[00:11] theBrettman: usually, package managers have outdated stuffs
[00:11] secoif: grom358 it just allows you to use npm to manage your deps
[00:11] isaacs: theBrettman: or do you mean "should i install this module I'm using from npm, or pull it from its git repo?"
[00:11] secoif: charrly have you installed other modules successfully with -g
[00:12] grom358: secoif: okay the thing is. I will have a server in the future. This script is for creating dataset the server is gonna use. Its a one time use script for setting up dataset
[00:12] teadict: aggghrrh, why isn't it updating the output?!
[00:12] theBrettman: I guess npm then would be if I just wanna use it and git would be if I wanna develop it?
[00:12] grom358: okay.. yeah I'll set up as module so can use npm to manage my deps
[00:12] charrly: secoif, no. Everytime in install a module it's: npm install module-name and it works fine
[00:12] jacobolus has joined the channel
[00:13] secoif: charrly try installing nodeunit, npm install -g nodeunit

[00:15] isaacs: thriple: i'd use nave
[00:15] isaacs: thriple: of course, that's because i know the author so well :)
[00:15] isaacs: charrly: use sudo with global installs if you get EACCES errors.
[00:15] sechrist: so are people using socket.io on heroku? multiple dynos would break that no?
[00:16] secoif: isaacs shouldn't he simply adjust config so sudo isn't required
[00:16] thriple: Sounds good to me, I'm having some issues getting nvm working
[00:16] secoif: isaacs eg chmodding some stuff
[00:16] isaacs: secoif: or that.  either is fine.  sudo is a little bit better if you trust me, but don't trust package install scripts.
[00:16] charrly: secoif, what do you mean by global installs?
[00:16] isaacs: secoif: npm downgrades perms if you're root
[00:16] langworthy has joined the channel
[00:17] isaacs: charrly: global installs ==> npm install -g blah or npm install blah --global
[00:17] secoif: isaacs I don't trust package install scripts. Mainly because people like me write them.
[00:17] thriple: isaacs: if i am installing node v0.4.9 I need to npm specifically for that version right?
[00:17] isaacs: secoif: then you shoudl use root
[00:17] charrly: ok
[00:17] isaacs: secoif: so that the scripts will be run as nobody instead of being run as you
[00:17] secoif: ah
[00:17] charrly: secoif, thanks. it worked as root :)
[00:17] cronopio: &
[00:18] keeto has joined the channel
[00:18] secoif: isaacs ha, so it's actually more secure to run as root
[00:18] isaacs: secoif: yes.
[00:18] isaacs: secoif: unless you trust package authors more than you trust me.
[00:18] isaacs: secoif: then you should not run anything as anybody.
[00:18] isaacs: :)
[00:19] isaacs: secoif: sudo su; su -i nobody; npm install blah
[00:19] twolfson has joined the channel
[00:19] secoif: isaacs where does it install globals to as nobody? 
[00:19] isaacs: secoif: the same
[00:20] isaacs: secoif: so you'd have to configure it to go somewhere nobody can write to
[00:20] meso has joined the channel
[00:20] isaacs: (but how can it write to it if it's somewhere nobody can write to!?)
[00:20] isaacs: ACTION rimshot
[00:20] secoif: so allow nobody to write to ~/.npm ?
[00:20] secoif: hah

[00:24] secoif: it'd be good if one of the package mangers coudl swap npm versions as well

[00:25] eignerchris has joined the channel
[00:26] thriple: secoif: yeah, thats why I was all excited to use the version manager. I'm stuck on 0.4 without it

[00:28] grom358: secoif: thanks for the help. So got this package.json almost done now :)
[00:28] secoif: grom358 np.
[00:29] grom358: secoif: In the future its gonna be a server. Just currently it only has this command line tool for making the dataset. So I don't need preferGlobal right?
[00:29] upstream: node-waf doesn't seem to be available on Windows, anyone can confirm this?
[00:29] secoif: grom358 make it into two modules
[00:29] secoif: grom358 single responsibility principle
[00:30] eb4890 has joined the channel
[00:30] secoif: grom358 my app went from being a great collosal mindfuck to being a bunch of small, nearly trivial modules. works pretty good.
[00:31] grom358: yeah.. I was thinking this script would just live in tools folder
[00:31] secoif: grom358 encourages you to have low coupling, decent APIs and not use backdoors 
[00:31] thriple: secoif I think I just need two computers :p
[00:31] grom358: mmm.. I could actually export some of the stuff this script uses into a module so others can use it
[00:31] secoif: thriple vmware/virtualbox perhaps
[00:32] secoif: so i've got an  exception throwin in a process.nextTick handler. my only option is to catch it with global exception handler right?

[00:52] secoif: SubStack teadict  node's ability to watch files is totally f'ed up on OSX. fs.watch simply doesn't work reliably.
[00:52] AviMarcus: Oh. ah I ran the wrong command. hold.
[00:52] SubStack: AviMarcus: there are lots of modules to parse csv files on npm, check out http://search.npmjs.org/
[00:52] ryanrolds_w: AviMarcus: http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/readline.html and explode the string on ','.

[00:55] isaacs: valid csv^
[00:55] isaacs: should parse as ["x", "a,b", "c\nd\"e"], i think
[00:55] isaacs: if you're doing windows-style quote escaping
[00:55] AviMarcus: :)

[02:39] sanitypassing: node is failing to compile. On the 'make' process, it returns "/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lz", and it is Error #2. Does this mean I am missing a dependency?
[02:40] isaacs: Test, please: http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.6.8-RC/node-v0.6.8-RC1.tar.gz
[02:40] Aria: Yes -- you need zlib.
[02:40] sanitypassing: Aria: I'm missing zlib?
[02:40] yozgrahame has joined the channel

[02:40] sanitypassing: this is a fresh Debian system
[02:40] sanitypassing: Odd..
[02:40] isaacs: sanitypassing: what version of node you trying to compile?
[02:41] Aria: zlib is part of debian base. But the headers are not installed by default.
[02:41] sanitypassing: isaacs: latest from the git repo.
[02:41] Aria: so install zlib-dev
[02:41] isaacs: sanitypassing: ah, hm.  that's a bug.  it should be building based on the bundled zlib in deps.
[02:41] sanitypassing: Aria: Doesn't have an installation candidate.

[02:41] isaacs: sanitypassing: does http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.6.8-RC/node-v0.6.8-RC1.tar.gz work for you?
[02:42] isaacs: (watch as i turn your bug report into a way to get you to do my bidding... mwahaha!)
[02:42] sanitypassing: Lemme download and untar it
[02:43] sanitypassing: isaacs: it's node source?
[02:43] isaacs: sanitypassing: yeah
[02:43] sanitypassing: isaacs: Alright.
[02:43] sanitypassing: isaacs: Fails on ./configure
[02:43] isaacs: sanitypassing: almost done with the 0.6.8 release.
[02:43] isaacs: sanitypassing: well, that's messed.
[02:43] isaacs: sanitypassing: gist output?
[02:43] isaacs: or pastie or whatever you prefer
[02:43] sanitypassing: Alright
[02:44] sanitypassing: isaacs: https://gist.github.com/1644631
[02:45] isaacs: sanitypassing: yeah, ok, same deal.  sudo apt-get install openssl-dev, i think
[02:45] isaacs: sorry, no: libssl-dev
[02:45] isaacs: and zlib-dev
[02:45] sanitypassing: Sure, just a moment.
[02:45] isaacs: we ought to really use the bundled versions, though.  otherwise that's just silly to bundle them.
[02:45] tornad has joined the channel
[02:46] sanitypassing: isaacs: well, could my system architecture have caused it to fail? 
[02:46] sanitypassing: (x86-64)
[02:46] isaacs: sanitypassing: nono, because we bundle the source
[02:46] isaacs: sanitypassing: we should just build it, like we do v8

[03:20] mraxilus: for a basic node.js application which is better to use, mongodb, couchdb, or something else entirely?
[03:21] Aria: Depends. What is your application doing?
[03:21] jsurfer has joined the channel
[03:21] mraxilus: chat application
[03:21] mraxilus: it just needs to store user details, messages, etc.
[03:21] Aria: Long term or short term storage?
[03:22] mraxilus: short term mainly, with an option to store logs.
[03:22] Aria: So some of each.
[03:23] mraxilus: 0.o
[03:23] Aria: Mongo has pretty good write performance. With logs, your load is write-heavy. 
[03:23] esundahl has joined the channel
[03:23] Aria: Couch I have no experience with, though I know its magic sauce is partly in the syncing and conflict resolution.
[03:23] Aria: Which probably gets you nothing in this case.
[03:23] Aria: Redis is another interesting option -- it's good for online data sets, where you're accessing a lot of live data.
[03:23] chadskidmore has joined the channel
[03:23] Aria: Like the live part of chat.
[03:24] mraxilus: I see.
[03:25] Aria: (I might use redis + plain files for logging.)
[03:25] mraxilus: so proably redis for short term, and mongo for logs?
[03:25] grom358 has joined the channel
[03:25] Aria: That'd work well. How big are you trying to scale?
[03:25] Aria: (It may be that you don't have to care much)
[03:25] Aria: (in which case, choose one rather than two.)
[03:26] mraxilus: Hmm, i really hate decisions like this. lol
[03:27] Aria: Hehe. The real trick is to understand what sort of access patterns you need.
[03:27] Aria: It's not node that dictates what to use, it's the access patterns and data that do.

[07:23] runvnc: I would have built this service on linode if they had a 256mb server for 11 bucks a month like rackspace
[07:24] zomg: interesting, I thought rackspace was kinda expensive :P
[07:24] blueski3s: i feel like i'm back in 2008 with rails
[07:24] blueski3s: :D
[07:25] blueski3s: using linode again is a dirty, dirty feeling 
[07:25] runvnc: They have a managed vps service which is pricey

[07:27] HardBit: and C# of course
[07:27] mh415: I work at Microsoft.
[07:28] runvnc: That's the nice thing about freenode
[07:28] mh415: What's your question?  Happy to try to answer.
[07:28] runvnc: Its so tolerant and polite
[07:28] runvnc: I bet if this were #node.js on efnet

[07:37] deoxxa: shellox: i was, but it's no longer developed
[07:37] runvnc: So no one else got a random 404 or 400 from rackspace create server api?
[07:37] shellox: deoxxa: i try to figure out how it works
[07:38] kenperkins: runvnc: ever? or just now
[07:38] runvnc: ever
[07:38] shellox: if i undestand it right then you need a server which render the templates?
[07:38] runvnc: I got my first 400 bad request from a create server api call at 3:42 pm today
[07:38] runvnc: then I ran the exact same script 'manually' tonight
[07:38] kenperkins: i get garbage from them occaisonally
[07:38] runvnc: and it didn't give any error
[07:38] runvnc: I was getting 404s
[07:39] runvnc: so now my script checks for that and retries
[07:39] runvnc: their sys admin said it was a known issue (404) and to just retry
[07:39] shellox: deoxxa: what are you using today?

[07:43] deoxxa: there's also duster.js

[07:49] deoxxa: NothingMan65: you can still use package.json to install your dependencies
[07:49] runvnc: On EFNet no one would try to help qbix2.  He would be bad-mouthed by three people simultaneously and then banned.

[07:50] kenperkins has joined the channel
[07:50] NothingMan65: lol "Okay, so simply"
[07:51] NothingMan65: Great sentence.
[07:51] deoxxa: is the plugin on npm?
[07:51] runvnc: Well realistically its not _that_ different on freenode although people are more polite because a lot of them are geniuses and have better things to waste their energy on than flaming people on irc who annoy them.
[07:51] rendar has joined the channel
[07:51] NothingMan65: Yeah, the "finished plugin is on npm"
[07:51] Qbix1: Hey guys whatever happened to that "node balancer" or whatever they call it, that YAHOO was using and then Express I think put into their code
[07:51] deoxxa: ah ok, cool
[07:51] Qbix1: basically running several Node processes at once and having a load balancer?
[07:51] Qbix1: where they figured out how to share socket file descriptors instead of opening new ones?
[07:51] deoxxa: NothingMan65: does the module need to go somewhere special, or will it work in node_modules?
[07:51] Qbix1: for IPC?
[07:51] anrope: I was trying to track down the exact javascript version that node-v0.6.8 implements, but I couldn't even find out what version of javascript v8 implements. My real question is: node.js doesn't support comprehensions, right?
[07:51] Qbix1: does node have it built in now?
[07:52] Qbix1: I think it was called fugue before, or something
[07:52] runvnc: Does the new cluster functionality share socket file descriptors?
[07:52] groom has joined the channel
[07:52] Qbix1: Yes, that's what I am basically asking about, the cluster functionality? I guess
[07:52] maletor has joined the channel

[07:53] stagas has joined the channel
[07:53] mange has joined the channel
[07:53] NothingMan65: deoxxa, Well, the "custom framework" has a ./plugins folder, and a .node_modules/ folder.  The proxy plugin will be in the ./plugins folder.  I can of course add a package.json which requires the dependency in ../../node_modules, right?  Or can I specify where the dependency should be installed?
[07:53] Qbix1: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.6.0/api/cluster.html
[07:53] deoxxa: ah, no, you can't specify where to install it to
[07:53] Qbix1: can this be used for load balancing somehow?
[07:53] NothingMan65: Ok
[07:54] deoxxa: sounds like you want a git submodule
[07:54] NothingMan65: Ok
[07:54] deoxxa: however!
[07:54] runvnc: anrope comprehensions? you mean like coffeescript has
[07:54] deoxxa: we had a similar system at work, but abandoned it in favour of just installing stuff to node_modules
[07:54] mikeal has joined the channel
[07:54] deoxxa: it made things a lot easier for us
[07:54] NothingMan65: Ah.
[07:54] deoxxa: but your use-case may be different
[07:54] anrope: runvnc, probably. I was thinking python.
[07:54] runvnc: I think load balancing generally refers to running multiple servers rather than multiple process qbix1
[07:54] NothingMan65: Most likely a more simple use case.
[07:54] anrope: runvnc, I just want to verify that node.js itself doesn't support comprehensions.
[07:55] deoxxa: yeah, the only people using it are developers as well, so we didn't have to worry about them complaining if they broke things
[07:55] runvnc: http://coffeescript.org/#loops
[07:56] Qbix1: okay but in any case, the question is
[07:56] Qbix1: how do they share the port
[07:56] jacobolus has joined the channel
[07:56] Qbix1: what actually happens?
[07:56] Qbix1: does a request always hit the same worker, or any workers?
[07:56] Qbix1: I mean request from same client
[07:56] NothingMan65: Ideally the npm module should have the ability to be used standalone via npm in any node application, OR with the custom framework.  But it might be best to require an installation of the npm plugin and reference the node_modules folder from the plugin.  Then we avert the submodule scenario.
[07:56] _shorinji_ has joined the channel
[07:56] Qbix1: do they share file descriptors?
[07:56] Qbix1: is it documented somewhere?
[07:57] dannyamey has joined the channel
[07:58] runvnc: I think it would be in the node.js source code qbix1
[07:58] runvnc: but why is that important
[07:58] runvnc: exactly how its implemented
[07:58] mh415: Qbix1:  this?  http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.6.0/api/cluster.html
[07:58] runvnc: If you are trying to do load balancing there are a bunch of modules and stuff for that if you search for node.js load balancing
[07:58] NothingMan65: So the custom framework plugin in ./plugins will have a package.json which has a dependency on the npm module.  Then, I can do require('../../node_modules/mymodule');
[08:00] runvnc: er nevermind me the cluster example is the first thing to try before going to random node modules that were made before that came out

[09:20] NothingMan65: Hmm.  I'm don't quite understand.  I have a custom framework plugin (proxy) not available via npm, which resides in 'nodeApp/plugins/proxy'.
[09:20] mattgiff_ has joined the channel
[09:21] NothingMan65: proxy requires another plugin which IS available via npm (real).
[09:22] NothingMan65: proxy is optional when using the custom framework.  Users should only have to copy the folder 'proxy' into their 'nodeApp/plugins/' folder and run 'npm install' from the 'nodeApp/' root for everything to work as planned.
[09:23] vguerra has joined the channel
[09:23] NothingMan65: I have a 'package.json' in the 'proxy/' folder which has a dependency pointing to 'real'.  But npm can't detect this since the plugin 'proxy' is not a dependency in root, and the plugin 'proxy' can't be installed via npm.
[09:23] NothingMan65: Does that make sense?

[09:27] jesusabdullah: You can also put the module in node_modules, add it to bundledDependencies and npm will also install its dependencies when you install the parent module
[09:28] NothingMan65: Okay, so dynamically load the 'real' dependency via 'proxy' by using ssh and git.  I think I git it now :)  Are there any good examples of doing this correctly which you can think of offhand?

[11:14] Segaja: i'm on ubuntu. what is a good node version manager for it?

[11:16] torvalamo: it's written i js
[11:16] Segaja: it is not
[11:16] Segaja: nvm is not in npm
[11:16] insin: right, this is extremely pernickety, but which one (documenting an optional first argument):
[11:17] insin: groups([params,] callback) or groups([params, ]callback)
[11:17] torvalamo: https://github.com/creationix/nvm
[11:17] robotmay_ has joined the channel
[11:18] torvalamo: insin, if i was writing it, last one, but the first one is more readable
[11:18] Glenjamin: I'm a fan of "n" for multi-node version management
[11:18] torvalamo: although it messes with you if you have OCD
[11:18] Glenjamin: npm install -g n
[11:18] insin: heh,  I agree
[11:18] ppcano_ has joined the channel
[11:19] Glenjamin: groups([params, ] callback) ?
[11:19] torvalamo: you must die
[11:19] insin: hmm, node.js docs style would be groups([params], callback) (and it would probably swap them to avoid the first being optional)
[11:19] benvie: first optional is recipe for problems
[11:19] torvalamo: yeah but callback should be last
[11:19] eeemsi: \o/  thank you for another release
[11:19] Glenjamin: callback is always last
[11:20] benvie: don't specify, or describe as an option object
[11:20] benvie: say groups(callback), groups(params, callback)
[11:20] insin: I just want to keep it nice to read as used: groups(function() {}) groups({offset:50, limit: 25}, function() {})
[11:20] benvie: split it up because as is is confusing
[11:20] Glenjamin: i like benvie's approach, specify both signatures serparately
[11:20] benvie: or
[11:20] AviMarcus has joined the channel
[11:21] insin: benvie: good idea
[11:21] benvie: groups(callback), groups(options), options has { xxxx, xxx, xxx, callback }
[11:21] benvie: if they want to be specific then they can handle giving an object
[11:21] torvalamo: you don't put the callback inside the options
[11:21] benvie: or at max, options object + callback
[11:21] torvalamo: that's just wrong
[11:21] benvie: yeah
[11:21] benvie: that's fine
[11:21] benvie: but no more than that
[11:22] benvie: fn(callback), fn(options, callback)
[11:22] torvalamo: i wrote a small module for this once
[11:22] torvalamo: optional first arguments
[11:22] torvalamo: it's called argtype.js
[11:22] torvalamo: it's messy

[11:24] torvalamo: even the argtype decorator itself has optional order of argumeents

I have an unhealthy obsessions with this
[11:24] torvalamo: :P
[11:24] insin: hmm, will rename it to options too, the fact that those values end up as query parameters is an implementation detail

[11:29] torvalamo: they need me, i don't need them
[11:29] torvalamo: :P
[11:29] benvie: it's awesome for documenting exactly, line by line, what you've done and can do
[11:30] benvie: and we're in a world where the stuff we do is in high demand and short supply
[11:30] torvalamo: dunno if it's in high demand, because they still tend to go with php and settle for below average programmers
[11:31] MrTrick has joined the channel
[11:31] torvalamo: i don't know about you but i don't have the time to badmouth php in front of an employer and try to convince them to use node
[11:31] benvie: well yeah that's true but it's in such high demand that those terrible options are often the best they can get or can afford
[11:31] benvie: node specifically is still working on ubiquity
[11:32] benvie: js certainly has reached the top though
[11:32] sriley: erm just cos someone uses php doesnt mean they are a below average programmer
[11:32] torvalamo: no
[11:32] benvie: no of course not
[11:32] torvalamo: but if they ONLY use php they are
[11:32] torvalamo: almost guaranteed
[11:32] Ezku: ...but it does make it more probable.
[11:32] benvie: there's a large contingent of people who fit that mould
[11:32] benvie: it's similar to "jquery programmers"
[11:33] torvalamo: people who use python and ruby are pretty capable of writing awesome php code any day
[11:33] torvalamo: not the other way around though
[11:33] sriley: php is a language, jquery isnt
[11:33] benvie: jquery is an awesome tool
[11:33] benvie: yeah I know
[11:33] Ezku: torvalamo: neither does someone using python or ruby automatically make them awesome
[11:33] torvalamo: no but it's more probably
[11:33] torvalamo: probable
[11:33] sriley: not really
[11:33] benvie: but the result is similar

[11:36] torvalamo: anyone who starts out with php will think they are awesome no matter how little they know... because it will run, and it will do SOMETHING... even if it's not what you intended (because it has passive errors).... with python and ruby if you screw up, then you won't get anywhere... so it's like a deterrent for idiots
[11:36] benvie: javascript is a really easy language to start in on, to get things done in, and node is extremely accessible to use
[11:36] runvnc: Yeah, PHP programmers are idiots.
[11:36] benvie: it is no harder and most likely easier than php, so it's not about that
[11:36] torvalamo: yeah that's what i said
[11:36] torvalamo: totally

[11:37] AvianFlu has joined the channel
[11:37] torvalamo: i used php before
[11:37] benvie: php was the thing to get things done in for web stuff for a long time and I'd be surprised to find many people who don't have some experience with it
[11:37] runvnc: Sure, PHP sucks in some ways.
[11:37] benvie: it's not the language
[11:37] runvnc: But this conversation is so tired.
[11:37] _shorinji_: php is easy to learn, hard to master. that is all.
[11:37] torvalamo: in fact everyone i have ever met who is a php programmer, has been.. less than adequate
[11:38] mAritz: #php
[11:38] torvalamo: met in real life that is
[11:38] torvalamo: not online
[11:38] runvnc: There's the problem right there torvalamo
[11:38] torvalamo: online is full of nerds who are good
[11:38] sriley: my guess is that youve not met any professional developers then...
[11:38] torvalamo: oh i have
[11:38] runvnc: I am CoffeeScript/Node.JS/C#/C++/.NET programmer
[11:38] runvnc: AND PHP
[11:38] benvie: but the point is that if I see someone self-identify as a php programmer, or a "front-end developer who's an expert at jquery" then I classify them in a certain way
[11:38] runvnc: and I am sick of people dissing PHP programmers
[11:38] mAritz: torvalamo: i can say the same about 90% of java developers i've met professionally... :x
[11:38] _shorinji_: what about "web programmers"? :)
[11:39] benvie: it's not my judgement of the language, it's my judgement of their choice to identify themselves in a way that classifies them for me
[11:39] runvnc: And jquery is a very useful tool.. its dumb to throw out everyone who uses it.
[11:39] benvie: I classify someone who self-identifies as a java developer in another way as well
[11:39] liar has joined the channel
[11:39] torvalamo: one potential employer asked me if I read the PHP source code to learn from it... I'm like... dude, first of all that shit is unreadable.. second, i don't need to learn from the source code that running a n^3 function is slow as fuck
[11:40] runvnc: The problem is that this classification based on identification is superficial.
[11:40] benvie: the point is the person thinks that defining themselves by the moniker is a positive and that fact alone is enough to classify them
[11:40] benvie: this is reflective to their self-identification
[11:40] torvalamo: the thing with java developers is that java is the language of choice in many schools and universities
[11:40] runvnc: Its the same type of thinking that leads to everyone wearing black-rimmed glasses even though they can see and/or have contacts
[11:40] torvalamo: i think that's nuff said
[11:40] runvnc: Because everyone wants to self-identify and other-identify as a nerd.
[11:41] runvnc: But just because you say you are "not a jquery developer" and rather a "backbone developer" or "Ruby developer" vs. "PHP programmer" REALLY doesn't mean that you are a better programmer or worse one.
[11:41] runvnc: The same way wearing glasses doesn't make you smart.
[11:41] benvie: well regardless, I think the original point way back was open-source is great and one thing it does is allows you as a contributor to prove your capability not by words or classifications or titles, but by lines of code and specific contribution
[11:41] benvie: and not sure how we got here
[11:42] insin: I self-identified as a Java programmer just last night at a talk about writing fast, clean code with respect for what CPUs are actually doing, because the question from the speaker was "who here uses Java?"
[11:42] shinuza has joined the channel
[11:42] Ezku: if you're at the tenth decile of programmers, and adamant in maintaining the standards of your craft, of course you're going to find most developers sub-par

[11:43] N0va` has joined the channel
[11:43] benvie: identifying as someone who can program in java is different from being a self-identified java programmer. I think most of us agree that being experienced in and often using multiple languages is the mark of likely well-rounded developer

[11:43] torvalamo: Ezku, it's not about the quality of code of them i find repulsive.. some of them have very readable and useful code despite not being necessarily awesome... but it's their attitude of "I know PHP really well so I know a lot about programming"..

[11:44] runvnc: Tools and architecture matter, but assuming people are idiots just because they write PHP code or C code or whatever is the equivalent of assuming people who believe in God are stupid.
[11:44] benvie: and the point is that someone who actively is the opposite of that and then identifies singly with a language not known for great engineering isn't a likely champion for the cuase
[11:44] PhatBob: Hello Noders
[11:44] _shorinji_: hello
[11:45] torvalamo: runvnc,  it's not an assumtion, it's proven :P
[11:45] PhatBob: can anyone point me to any help with writing my own stream?
[11:45] runvnc: People have crazy beliefs regardless of how smart they are.  I have a twin brother who is a hardcore Christian.  He's a business intelligence analyst.  I am an atheist currently doing CoffeeScript/Node
[11:45] NothingMan65_ has joined the channel
[11:45] torvalamo: business intelligence analyst.. totally.. that's a job that was made up by someone for no reason
[11:45] PhatBob: I want to do some token replacement if a sequence appears in a stream
[11:46] benvie: I'm not sure what exactly type of help you would find best, but I personally usually refer to node's source itself
[11:46] benvie: https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/stream.js
[11:46] benvie: which is very approachable
[11:46] insin: ACTION prepares to ostracise runvnc in an atheist schism for his CS usage
[11:47] PhatBob: @benvie thats brilliant thanks, I effectively want to join two streams via a pipe
[11:47] satyr has joined the channel
[11:47] benvie: so at basic you'd likely have an object that listens to the given sources and then emits events for both
[11:47] benvie: a stream is largely an event emitter https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/events.js
[11:48] benvie: basicslly just implementing some translating of data on top
[11:48] unomi has joined the channel
[11:49] PhatBob: when I get a stream fed to me, I want to find a squence of characters e.g. [TOKEN] then inject the contents of my stream at that point, then continue the original stream
[11:49] runvnc: Just look at how many geniuses there are working with Microsoft's tools.
[11:49] torvalamo: all two of them?
[11:50] benvie: so with a stream you'll be listening to some event, likely stream.on('data', callback)
[11:50] torvalamo: joel spolsky and whoever that other guy is
[11:50] benvie: so your middle man would set up that callback, process the data, then emit it's own data event with the processed data
[11:51] torvalamo: but microsoft's tools aren't as bad as php
[11:51] torvalamo: so
[11:51] tomasztomczyk has joined the channel

[11:52] benvie: I was a fan of zend framework though it was...really goddamn big
[11:52] benvie: just in sheer mindspace
[11:53] torvalamo: oh yeah the framework era
[11:54] shellox has left the channel
[11:54] benvie: node's standard userland module stuff I find works really well, with each thing generally being conceptually digestable with only a small amount of learning
[11:54] benvie: zend framework would probably be something like 1000 node modules all in one
[11:54] torvalamo: yeah i'm a fan of making each part as small as possible
[11:54] torvalamo: that is, as small a job as possible
[11:55] torvalamo: easier to debug, easier to replace, easier to optimize
[11:55] benvie: most goals are small so it makes sense that the tools are small, easy to find, and easy to combine
[11:57] benvie: frameworks generally arise I think because of the lack of an answer for the "easy to combine" part. So instead they shoot to just have everything included so combining isn't necessary
[11:57] PhatBob: @benvie - most likely this is the answer, thanks
[11:57] insin: I love Node's and the node community's approach to modules :)
[11:57] benvie: which just makes them overwrought, overcomplicated, and difficult to learn
[11:57] benvie: no problem Bob, hope it helps you figure out the solution!
[11:58] PhatBob: if it works then I will be able to do things like the <%tag %> in asp/jsp
[11:58] torvalamo: node's module design is kind of like python's
[11:58] insin: But I also love "monolithic" frameworks *if* they've been well thought out and just seem to make sense without  too much ceremony
[11:59] PhatBob: and inject data into socket replies
[11:59] benvie: agree insin and some do, but it's hard to do and rare as a result
[11:59] RLa has joined the channel
[11:59] benvie: you're looking to do a kind of templating where the replacement happens at the socket/emitter level?
[11:59] benvie: or I guess reach out to external interpreter
[11:59] benvie: makes sense
[12:00] qsobad has joined the channel
[12:00] PhatBob: yes - really at any level where a stream can be passed through the "joiner"
[12:00] benvie: well more a splitter and joiner
[12:01] PhatBob: currently this if for injecting metadata into a file
[12:01] PhatBob: but if written correctly it will work for any stream type
[12:01] PhatBob: I guess a spliter and joiner is a Splicer
[12:01] benvie: determine what needs to be sent to which converted/interpreter, and then bring the result back together
[12:02] benvie: wherever those two parts happen
[12:02] PhatBob: pretty much
[12:02] PhatBob: first I need the simple version to work ;-)
[12:02] benvie: I think you're on the right track doing it at the stream level, since it's reaching to external applications
[12:03] benvie: you just need a basic parser to break out which chunks go to which external thing
[12:03] PhatBob: thats the problem
[12:03] PhatBob: the object type of the buffer is unknown to me
[12:03] benvie: well for a basic functional version
[12:03] PhatBob: it appears to be 412bytes (in this case) of string
[12:04] benvie: a buffer can be converted to a string easily enough
[12:04] benvie: are you referring to the buffer a stream gives you?
[12:04] PhatBob: thanks to that source you sent me I see that pipe copies chunks through
[12:04] PhatBob: the object passed to 'ondata' events
[12:04] benvie: at most basic you can to buffer.toString('utf8') and that'll return a regular JS string
[12:05] benvie: yeah that'll work, or if you specify the data type for the stream's source
[12:05] benvie: like
[12:05] PhatBob: its better to keep it in the native format
[12:05] benvie: httpClient.setEncoding('utf8')
[12:05] PhatBob: less processing overhead
[12:05] benvie: yeah the less you convert it the better of course
[12:06] PhatBob: and it keeps the data type raw so stream to stream processing is simpler
[12:06] Mare13h has joined the channel
[12:06] benvie: for that your goal would be to have the data source providing control codes at the binary level so you can determine at the raw data level
[12:07] dr0id has joined the channel
[12:07] benvie: or I guess searching for tags could be done at that level, like '<%' in binary
[12:07] DarkGlass has joined the channel
[12:07] benvie: or whatever encoding
[12:08] PhatBob: well the JS object would need a prototype token so that the coder gets to decide how they're going to handle the encoding
[12:08] benvie: this may provide some example as well https://github.com/dscape/clarinet
[12:09] PhatBob: that looks good, I'll go and read it, thanks for your help mate, and have a good weekend

[12:39] simenbrekken has joined the channel
[12:39] torvalamo: first of all, it goes down below the viewport on my laptop
[12:39] torvalamo: so i'll have to scroll all the time
[12:39] xbayrockx: Eh ?
[12:40] torvalamo: and second, what's it supposed to do
[12:40] torvalamo: all i see is squares of gradient colors
[12:40] xbayrockx: you mean your resolution is small ?
[12:40] torvalamo: my resolution is at max for the laptop
[12:40] xbayrockx: Which is?
[12:40] piscisaureus_ has joined the channel
[12:40] torvalamo: 1360 or something
[12:40] torvalamo: sec
[12:41] torvalamo: 1280x800 actually
[12:41] xbayrockx: Anyway it's the beginning. You can drag the mouse on the canvas to pan/scroll across the mass of 'trading cards in the field of play'
[12:41] torvalamo: yeah that i noticed
[12:42] torvalamo: you'll probably be better of scanning for pageWidth (or one of them variables) and setting the canvas size at the start
[12:42] torvalamo: instead of having a fixed size
[12:43] xbayrockx: I see
[12:43] xbayrockx: cool
[12:43] torvalamo: also width and height change on an "onresize" event, so you can listen to that if the window is resized
[12:43] torvalamo: and resize the canvas

[16:44] sriley: imo coffee script is for people that want to learn a new "language", they want to write javascript, but dont want to learn javascript
[16:45] saidinesh5: sriley: or the usecase i ve suggested :P 
[16:45] adomokos: sriley: I am thinking in JS when I write CS code
[16:45] sriley: doesnt that fit that scenario ;)
[16:45] saidinesh5: hahah
[16:45] panosru: if you need to learn coffee-script just to have some fancy neat style of coding and making other say "OMFG what is he typing" well then it's not worth to learn it :D Also if it drops your productivity rhythm then again is not learn to work with it but I believe is worth to test it :D
[16:47] panosru: thinking in js while writing cs is normal at the beginning but not after some period of time, you should be more comfortable of thinking in cs way
[16:47] saidinesh5: yups..... i m more comfy not using the ()s for a function call :P

[18:02] trose: using node.js if i just want to return text can i use res.send('hello world'); res.end(); or is there more to it?
[18:02] isaacs: possibly many bugs in all of those :)
[18:02] isaacs: trose: yep, you can do that, for sure.  you do need to res.writeHead(status, headers) first, though

[18:27] FrenchRoyalHeir: AvianFlu: It does seem slow to get it up and running with the .env() method.

[18:28] dilvie: by "static" parts, I mean the bits that are the same for every user.

[19:55] isaacs: megalomix: i wrote this blog post for you: http://blog.izs.me/post/2353458699/an-open-letter-to-javascript-leaders-regarding

[19:55] benvie: 'your mother was a landlubber'
[19:55] benvie: function ...
[19:55] mikeal: ok, back
[19:55] mikeal: so, mmalecki what do you want exactly?
[19:56] mmalecki: mikeal: to be able to write ?key="balancer" instead of ?key=%22balancer%22
[19:56] isaacs: mikeal: hey, do you have any insights on this http memory-leak? https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/2577  it looks related to http2.
[19:56] mmalecki: sec, I'll give uou an example
[19:56] benvie: the js parser has a set of rules, and you ran into the one blackhole of not using semicolons
[19:56] mmalecki: oh, well, maybe not XD
[19:57] mikeal: but you want request to auto-escape?
[19:57] mmalecki: mikeal: yeah, something like that. " to %22
[19:57] isaacs: megalomix: certain tokens always continue the line above.   x\n(y) is a function call to x.
[19:57] orlandovftw has joined the channel
[19:57] mmalecki: like browsers do.
[19:57] mikeal: the problem with auto-escaping all the querystrings is that you run the risk of double escaping
[19:57] mikeal: but
[19:57] mikeal: there is a feature
[19:57] zitchdog has joined the channel
[19:57] isaacs: megalomix: it is NOT the same as x;(y)
[19:57] mikeal: that isn't really documented well
[19:57] mmalecki: mikeal: more like 'have you considered' than 'do want'
[19:57] benvie: by wrapping an immediately invoked function call in parenthesis you made it also a valid paremeter for the statement prior to it
[19:57] benvie: function call
[19:58] k1ttty has joined the channel
[19:58] megalomix: isaacs, yes i understand.....only if the ( is the first character of the line

[19:58] isaacs: megalomix: bingo
[19:58] mikeal: actually, nm, that is something else
[19:58] mikeal: honeslty
[19:58] isaacs: megalomix: i'm saying this to you as an avid semicolon minimalist.
[19:58] megalomix: isaacs, fuck i saved that post! very useful
[19:58] mikeal: couchdb needs to accept a form POST for all view queries
[19:58] isaacs: megalomix: you *need* them there.
[19:58] benvie: (function(){})      (function(){})
[19:58] isaacs: megalomix: it's especially important.
[19:58] mikeal: instead of only accepting it when keys is present
[19:58] benvie: you see the problem?
[19:59] benvie: the second function in parens turns into a call
[19:59] isaacs: megalomix: that's why i was harping on you to share the rest of the code, not just the part that throws.
[19:59] megalomix: ok isaacs ....yes me too i don't like to use ; always :D
[19:59] mikeal: isaacs: that memory leak is probably real but has most likely been there for a very long time
[19:59] mikeal: before http2
[19:59] isaacs: mikeal: the data seems to indicate otherwise.
[19:59] megalomix: isaacs, yes, you are right...excuse me
[19:59] mikeal: because the code that interacts with the parser is mostly adapted from code previous
[19:59] benvie: the semicolon doesn't need to be there, it just needs to not be parenthesis
[19:59] davidwalsh has joined the channel
[19:59] isaacs: mikeal: it could be that a leak wasn't exposed because we werent' doing socket pooling properly.
[20:00] mikeal: ah, you could be right there
[20:00] isaacs: mikeal: so it's quite possible that the code you wrote is correct, but it nevertheless correlates with the appearance of the bug.
[20:00] benvie: the parenthesis will be first interpreted as an invokation. There's plenty of other ways to make an immediately invoked function expression that doesn't need to return a valuwe
[20:00] benvie: !function(){}()
[20:00] isaacs: mikeal: the test takes like 20 minutes to run, though, so bisecting has been difficult.
[20:00] megalomix: benvie, ?? we need to put ; in front.....i'm don't getting you
[20:00] mikeal: well, the leak would have existed previous if you used keepalive and managed the pool yourself :)
[20:00] isaacs: mikeal: sure.
[20:01] mikeal: the patch makes sense
[20:01] mikeal: and should be merged regardless
[20:01] benvie: you need to change (function(){})() into ---> !function(){}()
[20:01] mikeal: basically, we need to be really agressive about freeing parsers
[20:01] benvie: in your case anyway
[20:01] isaacs: mikeal: which patch?  (i think we're both multiplexing...)
[20:01] mikeal: there is one in that ticket
[20:01] mikeal: https://github.com/koichik/node/commit/9cd1e9025ff2f3d1250c1d89b722a685ee9b924e
[20:02] megalomix: add ! first?
[20:02] megalomix: instead of ; ?
[20:02] benvie: either
[20:02] benvie: whatever
[20:02] megalomix: why? i'm using ; in front and works good..
[20:02] benvie: you just need a guard
[20:02] benvie: no it's fine
[20:02] benvie: if it works then we're done
[20:02] megalomix: :)
[20:02] megalomix: thank you benvie and isaacs 
[20:02] megalomix: thanks for your patience :D
[20:02] benvie: i overexplained, my apologies
[20:03] benvie: success = win = done

[20:05] _ding has joined the channel
[20:05] mikeal: isaacs: i think this leak is a good example of a systemic problem we have in core
[20:05] mikeal: we add crazy optimizations before we're feature complete
[20:05] mikeal: like, we could just be creating a new parser when we need it and letting it get garbage collected
[20:06] jxson has joined the channel
[20:06] mikeal: that's as reliable as v8
[20:06] djMax has joined the channel
[20:06] mikeal: instead, we want to save on the creation time to squeeze 5% out of a benchmark someone wrote against node 0.2 and we have this crazy freelist
[20:06] mikeal: which means we're now managing the references by hand
[20:06] djMax: I'm iterating over a bunch of files, running a multi-match regular expression and then want user input on each. Is there a synchronous readline so I don't have to kill myself?
[20:07] isaacs: mikeal: i agree.
[20:07] mikeal: basically, i'm saying that going forward we should stop writing optimizations until feature complete
[20:07] mikeal: which isn't too far off now anyway

[20:07] isaacs: mikeal: yes.

[20:07] isaacs: so... i'll ping dap and see if koichik's bug affects his tests.
[20:08] mikeal: take koichi's patch
[20:08] isaacs: i want to see the effects first.  but i'm pretty confident it'll help.

[20:08] BrianE has joined the channel
[20:08] jldbasa has joined the channel
[20:09] mikeal: thriple: where do you see taht?
[20:09] benvie: immediately invoke function expression with its value typecast to boolean before execution, indicating to the engine that the reurn won't be used
[20:09] benvie: won't be used as a non-primitive
[20:09] chvid has joined the channel
[20:09] isaacs: thriple: that's a IIFE, cast to boolean, and negated.
[20:09] criswell has joined the channel
[20:09] jefferai has joined the channel
[20:10] isaacs: benvie: it indicates no such thing to the engine, at least, not strictly based on the grammar.
[20:10] thriple: isaacs: what do you mean by negated?
[20:10] isaacs: benvie: it just prevents it from being interpreted as a function decl
[20:10] isaacs: thriple: it's like writing "false" on a line by itself.
[20:10] isaacs: it's just a boolean expression statemnt.
[20:10] benvie: well the main goal is to do that
[20:10] thriple: isaacs: what is the user?
[20:10] benvie: to make an IIFE
[20:10] calliostro has joined the channel
[20:10] thriple: use?
[20:11] benvie: javascript only has function scope
[20:11] benvie: so if you want private scoping yuo need to wrap your code in a function
[20:11] benvie: and you if you're doing it for that purpose then you simply want to execute it immediately and have no use for the return
[20:11] isaacs: it'd be really nice if function declarations were also valid function expressions, at least if unnamed.
[20:11] isaacs: but whatever.
[20:14] igl: that would mean no more anonymous balls
[20:14] djMax: Man, I wish I could understand streamline enough to know if it'll let me do a readline without horrendous syntax. Anybody understand it?
[20:14] thriple: benvie: I see, so you can't even execute it without the '!'
[20:15] benvie: it's turning a function statement into a function expression
[20:15] benvie: which can be done in a number of ways
[20:15] benvie: wrapping in parenthesis is the most common but runs the hazard of accidententlly being interpreted as the parameters and invokation of an above function

[20:17] herbySk has joined the channel
[20:17] benvie: the other being something like var x =  1 && function(){ return 'val' }()

[20:19] xpigeonx: is there a way to make binary flags in javascript?  instead having to do things like 1<<7 ?
[20:19] benvie: basically it's comparison operators and logical operators
[20:19] panosru: could anyone help me with this http://pastie.org/private/2r5tfbkhywlsqgmq22dyag ? I can't see where is my fault and why 404 is not working... it should work based on my code..
[20:19] benvie: and math operators
[20:20] benvie: logical operators return the last value so they can be used, parenthesis act as logical operators for wrapping values
[20:20] FrenchRoyalHeir: What's the most pragmatic way to get the querystring from the request object as a Javascript object of key/values?

[20:23] pyrotechnick: https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/master/lib/middleware/bodyParser.js
[20:23] isaacs: xpigeonx: oh, you mean, how to add them together?  js has & and | binary operators
[20:24] isaacs: xpigeonx: and ~
[20:24] isaacs: .. 0777 & (~(022))
[20:24] catb0t:  493
[20:24] isaacs: .. (0777 & (~(022))).toString()
[20:24] catb0t:  "493"
[20:24] isaacs: .. (0777 & (~(022))).toString(8)
[20:24] catb0t:  "755"
[20:24] benvie: var bitmask = flag1 << 1 | flag2 << 2 | flag << 3
[20:24] isaacs: there ya go
[20:24] pyrotechnick: 0 / 0
[20:24] benvie: er
[20:24] xpigeonx: @isaacs:  i mean like binary types, like if i wanted to make bitmasks
[20:24] pyrotechnick: didn't think so catb0t
[20:24] isaacs: xpigeonx: just use numbers.
[20:24] catb0t: didn't expect you to give me a stack trace at FUSED with think
[20:24] isaacs: .. 0/0
[20:24] catb0t:  NaN
[20:25] wmage has joined the channel
[20:25] xpigeonx: @isaacs: numbers are awkward and aren't obvious at first
[20:25] pyrotechnick: is it NaN or Infinity
[20:25] benvie: key.bind = mods[key.ctrl | key.meta << 1 | key.shift << 2] + key.name;
[20:25] isaacs: xpigeonx: and this differs from bitmasks how...?
[20:25] isaacs: xpigeonx: better yet, use config objects.
[20:25] benvie: I made that code to handle three booleans
[20:25] benvie: that works
[20:25] isaacs: Ie, instead of doSomething(f.FOO | f.BAR), use doSomething({foo: true, bar: true})
[20:26] xpigeonx: @isaacs: because if i only need an int to store somethings, why waste more space ?
[20:26] benvie: combined that bitmask with this array
[20:26] mikeal has joined the channel
[20:26] benvie: [ '', 'ctrl+', 'alt+', 'ctrl+alt+', 'shift+',      'ctrl+shift+', 'alt+shift+', 'ctrl+alt+shift+' ]
[20:26] isaacs: xpigeonx: you are optimizing something that is not a bottleneck.
[20:26] benvie: and it converts three booleans into a keybinding like ctrl+alt+shift+m
[20:27] xpigeonx: @isaacs: im not actually optimizing, protocol dictates this in the end
[20:27] isaacs: xpigeonx: have you see node-ctypes?
[20:27] isaacs: xpigeonx: it's explicitly designed for doing binary protocol stuff.
[20:27] panosru: I guess no one tried to have custom 404 page :D
[20:27] xpigeonx: @isaacs: no, but that name sounds like i will love it
[20:27] isaacs: :D
[20:28] benvie: check node-ffi if ctypes sounds up your alley
[20:28] isaacs: xpigeonx: what i mean is, if it's a real concern, you should do your space-sensitive coding in C
[20:28] yogig has joined the channel
[20:28] isaacs: xpigeonx: with node-ctypes, you can interpret a buffer as a bunch of c-type data, and it'll give you the js equivalents.

[20:29] isaacs: i don't know if it does sub-byte stuff, though.
[20:29] isaacs: for some protocols that matters.
[20:29] isaacs: and the handling of that is extraordinarily fiddly
[20:30] xpigeonx: @isaacs: i just have like 4 bits that dictate some stuff in a message over a protocol, and I just wanted to make the api for setting those bits easy. I could use numbers, but I would find later on that if i could just use constants with the actual bit flag that they set it would be more obvious

[20:34] isaacs: and there's only Number, no int8
[20:34] isaacs: etc.

[20:43] benvie: so the need for compatability often dictates whether you'd use something like underscore

[22:03] jiboumans: Hi, I have a service that takes a lot of incoming UDP messages/second (~100k) and sends it out to a backend tcp connection. Node doesn't seem to keep up with the incoming message wrt to the outgoing ones, as it keeps allocating more memory for every incoming message. At some point (rather quickly), it's trying to allocate more memory than the server has and it exits with terminate called after throwing an instance of 
[22:03] jiboumans: 'std::bad_alloc'. What's the right pattern to be following here? an RTFM pointer would be great too.

[22:04] robotmay has joined the channel
[22:05] chapel: looks to be right
[22:05] MatthewS has joined the channel
[22:05] jiboumans: chapel: so the pseudo code looks something like udp.on( message, function (data) { tcp.write( data ) } )
[22:06] jamund has joined the channel

[22:11] chapel: http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/net.html#socket.bufferSize
[22:11] chapel: that talks about the bufferSize
[22:11] chapel: Users who experience large or growing bufferSize should attempt to "throttle" the data flows in their program with pause() and resume().

[22:14] jiboumans: which udp can't do :(
[22:14] dodo_ has joined the channel
[22:14] jiboumans: chapel: setNoDelay doesn't help either.. it's still allocating buffer for all incoming udp messages faster than it can flush them
[22:14] chapel: hmm
[22:15] jiboumans: chapel: it's not a single growing buffer (that'd be easier), it's a 1k buffer per message it looks like (thereabouts)

[23:13] gigafied: Yeah, it's a bit odd because both packages require each other
[23:13] shanebo: opinion poll, in a mongo-like json world, is "collection" always an array?
[23:14] josephmoniz: a collection, yes
[23:15] jamund: it's a lot easier to search than a js array 
[23:15] josephmoniz: a hash would be a document
[23:15] josephmoniz: hash == object ofc
[23:15] shanebo: josephmoniz, okay so an object with repetitive nested objects in the exact same format would be called a document?
[23:16] gigafied: isaacs: It's a bootstrapped, so I copy a template_dir into a new folder, populating a package.json file etc. the bootstrap script calls npm link after it does what it needs to, a bit of a fringe case…. I guess I could temporarily throw a node_modules folder in there and copy my package to it in the bootstrap script
[23:16] gigafied: bootstrapper*
[23:16] josephmoniz: shanebo: objects have keys, so yes
[23:16] josephmoniz: while arrays only have offsets

[23:18] shanebo: josephmoniz, well it depends on the need, if you need an index, an object with keys pointing to objects is much better than looping through an array to find an object, however if sort order matters and the collection has no need for searching, an array is much better.
[23:19] shanebo: jamund, understood thanks
[23:19] josephmoniz: shanebo: yeah, but thats not the question as you asked it

[23:19] benvie: https://github.com/Benvie/listish
[23:19] josephmoniz: so you have collections, indexes and documents
[23:20] josephmoniz: collections are basically arrays, just places you lump documents/objects into
[23:20] josephmoniz: and indexes are basically hashes/objects typically implemented as B+Trees that hold pointers to documents in collections
[23:20] shanebo: josephmoniz, okay so in mongoland there's a metaphor known as index?
[23:21] josephmoniz: it's an actual noun not a metaphor but yeah
[23:21] josephmoniz: almost all DB's have indexes
[23:21] josephmoniz: as thats half the point of having a DB
[23:21] isaacs: gigafied: or, you could just put a symlink somewhere from wherever your stuff ends up to a folder called "node_modules" in the parent.
[23:21] isaacs: gigafied: the logic of how node looks up modules is pretty simple.
[23:22] josephmoniz: shanebo: http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Indexes
[23:22] shanebo: josephmoniz, thanks man
[23:22] josephmoniz: no problem
[23:23] gigafied: isaacs: yeah, the symlink idea just occurred to me… easiest way thanks!
