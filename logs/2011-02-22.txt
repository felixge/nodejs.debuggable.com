[03:47] marcello3d: probably should post this on github, but it'd be nice if attributes didn't need comma separation :)
[03:47] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: hmm, I guess it really depends what the require()s are, and the state of require.paths
[03:47] marcello3d: if you forget them, jade freaks out
[03:47] marcello3d: (or in my case I was porting some haml/scaml)
[03:48] tmzt: well, the modules were standalone site before running with spark, they each need their own version of lib/
[03:48] tjholowaychuk: marcello3d: haha yeah helped a guy with that today, the problem is that I need to parse js expressions in order to do attrs properly
[03:48] tmzt: what is the proper syntax to get the current directory of a module? I'll just try that
[03:48] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: __dirname
[03:48] tmzt: ok
[03:49] marcello3d: yea, I think scaml uses foo={} for expressions
[03:49] tjholowaychuk: but requires like require('./foo') should work
[03:49] petridish: tjholowaychuk: Perhaps this other error is a sign of something else being wrong: https://gist.github.com/838185 Any thoughts?
[03:50] tjholowaychuk: petridish: looks fine
[03:51] tjholowaychuk: marcello3d: jade just uses some naive split()s right now for attrs
[03:51] tjholowaychuk: nothing crazy
[03:51] marcello3d: yea, I hacked it a little bit
[03:51] tjholowaychuk: ill get around to it some day
[03:51] marcello3d: but didn't come up with anything I liked

[03:54] petridish: tjholowaychuk: Any thoughts on what is causing my error? Using node 0.2.6
[03:54] tmzt: tjholowaychuk: https://gist.github.com/838195
[03:55] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: the repl might fuck with it, i would just use files to test
[03:55] tjholowaychuk: repl does weird things some times i dunno
[03:55] tmzt: the problem seems to be it's not relative to the submodule (development/app.js)
[03:55] tmzt: I did, same error
[03:55] tmzt: I ran node vhost.js
[03:56] dominic__ has joined the channel
[03:56] tjholowaychuk: hm
[03:56] tjholowaychuk: the relative requires should always be relative to the calling script
[03:56] tjholowaychuk: AFAIK
[03:56] tmzt: that won't work very well here
[03:56] marcello3d: yes
[03:56] marcello3d: what tj said
[03:56] tmzt: I need the inner lib/ to be dependent on the version of the site
[03:56] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: why not?
[03:57] marcello3d: can you do ../ ?
[03:57] tmzt: so it's under development which tracks the development branch of the sites git
[03:57] tjholowaychuk: marcello3d: yup
[03:57] Jourkey has joined the channel
[03:57] marcello3d: (asking tmzt )
[03:57] tjholowaychuk: oh
[03:57] tjholowaychuk: lol
[03:57] tmzt: marcello3d: I think that would be backwards
[03:57] tmzt: what I need is a cluster.chroot() :)
[03:57] marcello3d: the other thing you can do is pass stuff in
[03:57] tmzt: but not unix chroot
[03:57] tmzt: hmm
[03:58] tmzt: or a module.require.paths
[03:58] tmzt: in node
[03:58] marcello3d: like module.exports = function(stuff-to-pass-in) { ... module code ... }
[03:58] marcello3d: then require("lib/foo")(...stuff...)
[03:58] tmzt: hmm, pass what exactly?
[03:58] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: .set('working directory', 'whatever')
[03:58] tmzt: in the module?
[03:58] tmzt: or on the server
[03:58] tmzt: okay
[03:59] tjholowaychuk: sounds like more of a structure issue and not cluster
[03:59] marcello3d: how does cluster deal with socket.io? (I'm not super familiar with how websockets work)
[04:00] tjholowaychuk: I haven't tried but it should be fine, I know guillermo is going to use it
[04:00] tjholowaychuk: with my nedis project as well
[04:00] tmzt: development.set('working directory', './development');
[04:00] tmzt: same error
[04:00] marcello3d: ah, websocket runs over http
[04:00] tmzt: how can I debug
[04:00] tmzt: oh
[04:00] tjholowaychuk: tmzt __dirname + '/development'
[04:00] tjholowaychuk: use node's debugger

[04:02] mbrochh has joined the channel
[04:04] tmzt: can you pass something in require() ?
[04:04] tmzt: hmm
[04:06] tmzt: is .set() a connect feature or a node feature?
[04:07] tjholowaychuk: set is express
[04:07] tmzt: or should I structure my app.js differently, like have it export one function or initialize it to a express.createServer nad pass that
[04:07] tmzt: so it would be development(express.createServer())
[04:07] tjholowaychuk: i dont really get what your development() thing is doing
[04:08] tjholowaychuk: express has app.configure() for environment specifics
[04:08] tmzt: module.export = function(server) { server.gets() }
[04:08] tmzt: in the app.js
[04:09] tmzt: I had them setup for spark but it's going to have to be different for cluster it seems
[04:09] softdrink has joined the channel
[04:09] tjholowaychuk: just have each one do var app = module.exports = express.createServer();
[04:09] tjholowaychuk: and cluster(require('./myapp')).listen(80)
[04:10] tjholowaychuk: well with the vhost i guess connect.createServer(blah blah bah)
[04:10] tjholowaychuk: and pass that server to cluster
[04:10] tmzt: that's what it was doing
[04:10] tmzt: that didn't work because the requires were in the module scope
[04:10] tjholowaychuk: it should work fine i do stuff like that all the time
[04:11] tmzt: how do you handle require paths in the sites then?
[04:11] tjholowaychuk: I just do relative requires
[04:11] tmzt: relative to the outer site?
[04:11] isaacs has joined the channel
[04:12] marcello3d: wow, some questions on stack overflow are just....so poorly written

[04:13] edude03 has joined the channel
[04:13] marcello3d: ".....?????"
[04:13] marcello3d: is that going to make people answer the question better or something?
[04:14] sleeplessinc has joined the channel
[04:15] tmzt: oh, it was fixed at some point, it's another of the site copies that is broken, oops
[04:16] marcello3d: does cluster provide any support for nodes talking to each other? any recommendations?
[04:17] tjholowaychuk: marcello3d:  not really, you could utilize the same IPC API that I use internally
[04:17] tjholowaychuk: but
[04:17] tjholowaychuk: I would recomment using a third-party module
[04:17] tjholowaychuk: that is less specific
[04:18] tjholowaychuk: its not really the goal of the lib
[04:18] marcello3d: right
[04:18] ChrisPartridge: redis would work yeah?
[04:18] shaver: zeromq
[04:18] marcello3d: redis would be a bit overkill, right? I'd need to run yet another server/database?
[04:18] tjholowaychuk: marcello3d: if you just need local IPC just use a local socket
[04:19] tjholowaychuk: with json
[04:19] shaver: then you have to do all the messaging shit
[04:19] shaver: framing, error handling, etc.
[04:19] marcello3d: ideally I'd probably want something that's inter-cpu as well
[04:19] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[04:19] shaver: dnose
[04:19] tjholowaychuk: its pretty easy though
[04:19] shaver: dnode
[04:19] shaver: (dnose would be the dnode-specialized traffic sniffer)
[04:19] mikeal has joined the channel
[04:19] marcello3d: though knowing that two node instances are on the same server is probably helpful
[04:19] unomi has joined the channel
[04:20] marcello3d: yea, I'm thinking of using dnode, just wanted to see what other people thought :)
[04:20] marcello3d: would you run a dnode server on the cluster master?
[04:20] marcello3d: then have the cluster workers connect to it?
[04:20] shaver: just a warning
[04:20] tjholowaychuk: marcello3d: you could, master is not really all that active right now
[04:21] shaver: if you say "quorum" or "two phase", I'm going to throw up in my mouth a little
[04:21] marcello3d: I don't know what those are...
[04:21] marcello3d: but rum sounds good
[04:21] marcello3d: looking at zeromq
[04:22] marcello3d: is this for intra- or inter-computer
[04:23] bartt has joined the channel
[04:23] marcello3d: I guess both
[04:23] tjholowaychuk: what are you looking for?
[04:23] tjholowaychuk: inter?
[04:23] tjholowaychuk: sounded like you just wanted to talk locally to the workers or something
[04:23] marcello3d: well, I want to build the site so I'm not limited to a single server if I want to scale down the line
[04:23] zorzar has joined the channel
[04:24] shaver: well then
[04:24] shaver: what you need is CORBA
[04:24] marcello3d: ;D
[04:24] shaver: nyh2p
[04:25] marcello3d: now you're speaking in code D:
[04:25] shaver: now you have two problems
[04:26] postwait: shaver: it's a bit hard to talk about solving distributed systems problems if you don't want to hear about the core of the problems you need to solve.
[04:26] shaver: postwait: I know
[04:27] tjholowaychuk: yeah you dont really need to over think that until you come to a real issue
[04:27] shaver: postwait: I did my time
[04:27] marcello3d: probably
[04:27] tmzt: tjholowaychuk: got it working, wrapped the inner server in a function(app, path) { ... require.paths.unshift(path+'/lib'); return app; }
[04:27] marcello3d: the real issue now is having multiple node instances on one server
[04:27] tmzt: and used vhost(function(express.createServer, 'vhost'))
[04:27] marcello3d: that need to talk to each other
[04:27] tmzt: and used vhost(function(express.createServer(), 'vhost'))
[04:27] marcello3d: because I'm using socket.io
[04:27] tjholowaychuk: marcello3d: how so though? what kind of state are you relying on?
[04:27] tjholowaychuk: ah
[04:28] marcello3d: basic chat functionality
[04:28] tmzt: er, function would be development
[04:28] postwait: shaver, I know you did your time... I'm surprised that the work quorum will make you sick :-)
[04:28] postwait: As I did my time as well
[04:28] slaskis_: isaacs: is the directories.lib config in package.json already deprecated? i found it very useful as it would give me nicer require() path, is there an alternative?
[04:28] isaacs: slaskis_: yes
[04:28] shaver: it just brings back bad memories
[04:29] isaacs: slaskis_: i mean, yes, it's deprecated
[04:29] postwait: Sure it isn't just Oracle that brings back those memories?
[04:29] tmzt: shaver: are per-<browser /> session/cookiejars ever going to be a reality?
[04:29] isaacs: slaskis_: you can move the modules into the root of the package, if you want.
[04:29] shaver: and I *might* have been exaggerating for effect
[04:29] mbrochh has joined the channel
[04:29] mbrochh has joined the channel
[04:29] shaver: tmzt: I think something like it, yes
[04:29] isaacs: slaskis_: saving 4 bytes in your require() statement isn't worth the overhead in complexity in the module loader.
[04:29] shaver: postwait: I didn't have to deal with them at Oracle :-)
[04:30] mjr_: To help battle the scourge of CORBA, thankfully we have GI JSON.
[04:30] slaskis_: isaacs: aha, ok, it was nice to keep things in ./lib though
[04:30] shaver: I did CORBA at Netscape in '97
[04:30] isaacs: slaskis_: yeah
[04:30] mjr_: CORBA Commander, etc.
[04:30] shaver: in Java
[04:30] shaver: DO NOT RECOMMEND IT
[04:30] isaacs: mjr_: you are a real american hero
[04:30] slaskis_: i guess that's why it was there in the first place...
[04:30] mjr_: isaacs: thanks, knowing is half the battle.
[04:30] tmzt: tjholowaychuk: okay, cli colors work better with screen in 4.1?
[04:30] shaver: is there an Ice binding for node?
[04:30] isaacs: you know what i had for dinner tonight?  pork chop sandwiches.  true story.
[04:31] isaacs: hoooooooooooooooo
[04:31] tmzt: other than that it looks good, now I have to figure out how to reload each of those servers
[04:31] mjr_: isaacs: pork chop sandwiches is not a thing that exists, like simple distributed systems.
[04:31] mjr_: Which also do not exist.
[04:31] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: what do you mean work better
[04:31] isaacs: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1BDM1oBRJ8
[04:31] tjholowaychuk: what is it doing right now
[04:32] tmzt: hurt me

[04:32] marcello3d: anyone here use it?
[04:32] tjholowaychuk: mmk
[04:33] tmzt: my ultimate would be to have a git push hook on the repo that retriggered the server module for each vhost
[04:33] zemanel has joined the channel
[04:33] tmzt: but I can figure out how to do it from cli that's fine
[04:33] tjholowaychuk: SIGUSR2
[04:34] tmzt: per module?
[04:34] tjholowaychuk: on
[04:34] tjholowaychuk: no*
[04:34] tjholowaychuk: just one
[04:34] tjholowaychuk: just the master
[04:34] tjholowaychuk: it's irrelevant how many vhosts you have
[04:35] tmzt: are they running as different processes?
[04:35] tjholowaychuk: nope
[04:35] tmzt: PID on linux
[04:35] tmzt: or PPID
[04:35] tjholowaychuk: PID = process id PPID = parent process id
[04:35] marcello3d: vhost just looks at the Host: HTTP header
[04:35] tjholowaychuk: connect's vhosts are nothing special
[04:35] tjholowaychuk: just middleware that looks at the host header like he mentioned
[04:36] slaskis_: tjholowaychuk: i'm using cluster and the reload thing doesn't work very well, it seems to be unable to _resolveFilename: https://gist.github.com/da08c2cba783968308fd
[04:36] tjholowaychuk: probably the smallest connect middleware actually haha
[04:36] tjholowaychuk: slaskis_: yeah it seems to be a little problematic
[04:36] tjholowaychuk: what version?
[04:37] adrian_berg: npm's aim isn't to be cross-js-platform compliant like seed.js, correct?
[04:37] tmzt: can reload trigger a function?
[04:37] isaacs: adrian_berg: nope.
[04:37] noahcampbell has joined the channel
[04:37] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: the object returned by cluster(server) emits the "restarting" / "restart" events
[04:37] slaskis_: tjholowaychuk: 0.1.1, i see now that it's really old
[04:38] tjholowaychuk: slaskis_: ah, yeah its moving fast lol
[04:38] slaskis_: someone's been busy
[04:38] isaacs: adrian_berg: npm is the package client and publisher for node.
[04:38] tmzt: so, when it gets restarting is the old server gone?
[04:39] dominic__ has joined the channel
[04:39] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: yeah. master duplicates itself (and in turn the workers), when the old master finishes up with connections
[04:39] tjholowaychuk: it dies
[04:39] tjholowaychuk: and the new one just remains as-is
[04:39] tjholowaychuk: but emits the 'restart' event, as the old one has officially finished
[04:39] tmzt: and how does that work with vhosts?
[04:39] tjholowaychuk: vhosts have nothing to do with cluster
[04:39] tjholowaychuk: vhosts are just a tiny connect middleware
[04:40] davidwalsh has joined the channel
[04:40] marcello3d: think of vhosts as just different .get("/foo") routes
[04:40] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/master/lib/connect/middleware/vhost.js
[04:40] gagaforgaga has left the channel
[04:40] marcello3d: but instead of routing on path, you routing on host
[04:40] tjholowaychuk: yup
[04:40] tjholowaychuk: vhost() just happens to accept an http.Server instance
[04:40] tjholowaychuk: and passes the request on to it
[04:40] tmzt: okay, is the event per .use() in the outer connect server?
[04:41] tmzt: like can I detect an event on each of those and reload it
[04:41] tjholowaychuk: you dont need to
[04:41] tjholowaychuk: lol
[04:41] slaskis_: isaacs: the new npm is a bit stingy, it won't let me uninstall old packages...: https://gist.github.com/e74b2dddc134ab278b60
[04:41] marcello3d: does npm update itself?

[04:42] tmzt: but I was trying to avoid that
[04:42] isaacs: marcello3d: only when you tell it to
[04:42] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: you dont need to lol
[04:42] tjholowaychuk: i think you are confused man :(
[04:43] tjholowaychuk: its tough to explain
[04:43] tjholowaychuk: i will screencast about it some time
[04:43] isaacs: slaskis_: yeah, invalid json breaks it.
[04:43] adrian_berg: thanks for the responses isaacs 
[04:43] tmzt: I am, I have three different sites checked out from the same git repo
[04:43] isaacs: slaskis_: i guess it should do the eval thing if it's something already installed..
[04:43] tmzt: I want them served by different vhosts under the same domain
[04:43] isaacs: slaskis_: cuz that is a bit too obnoxious
[04:43] tmzt: I want to be restart them independently
[04:43] tjholowaychuk: AH
[04:43] tjholowaychuk: that you did not mention
[04:44] tjholowaychuk: then yes you need different clusters
[04:44] slaskis_: isaacs: yeah, that might be a good idea. if at least for a transition period
[04:44] tmzt: and SIGUSR2 each of them
[04:44] tjholowaychuk: but graceful restarts mean that should not really matter
[04:44] tmzt: with a nice little script
[04:44] tjholowaychuk: well
[04:44] tjholowaychuk: no
[04:44] tjholowaychuk: if you plan on reloading all of them at the same time
[04:44] tjholowaychuk: then just use one cluster
[04:44] tjholowaychuk: but i gotta go
[04:44] tmzt: no, each of them with it's own script

[06:01] ryan_: russell_h: I'm trying to prefetch content from several (around 60) given links in a very short amount of time, and it seems to get ahead of itself before it can render the content for serving it out in readable format.
[06:01] russell_h: what do you mean by 'get ahead of itself'?
[06:07] ryan_: Sadly, I'm not sure. It will fetch links asynchronously and my rendering method of the fetched content (using Readability https://www.readability.com/ ) takes longer to process that content. I guess I'm not sure how to queue it properly, so it fetches one at a time.

[08:22] jesusabdullah: ?
[08:22] shaver: a twitter conversation about typeof(NaN)
[08:22] mikeal: so, your declaration for python is off
[08:22] shaver: how so?
[08:22] mikeal: because you don't ever create NaN
[08:22] mikeal: you get it as the result of a bad parse
[08:22] jesusabdullah: hmm
[08:22] shaver: not true
[08:23] mikeal: in Python you don't get NaN from a bad parse, you usually get an exception or null
[08:23] shaver: >>> n = float('nan')
[08:23] shaver: >>> m = float('asdf')
[08:23] shaver: Traceback (most recent call last): File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
[08:23] shaver: ValueError: invalid literal for float(): asdf
[08:23] jesusabdullah: You can import types in python, too
[08:23] shaver: sure
[08:23] mikeal: right right
[08:23] shaver: but you can get NaN, and it has numeric type
[08:23] jesusabdullah: which is pretty awkward tbh
[08:23] shaver: parseInt could throw, but it predates exceptions
[08:23] mikeal: typeof parseInt('asdf') === number
[08:23] jesusabdullah: Does js have a NaN?
[08:23] shaver: yes
[08:23] jesusabdullah: Huh
[08:24] jesusabdullah: I haven't seen it yet
[08:24] mraleph has joined the channel
[08:24] mikeal: that's what everyone trips on
[08:24] jesusabdullah: Must've just been careful so far
[08:24] jesusabdullah: How do you get a NaN?

[08:24] jesusabdullah: I just tried to divide by zero and node gave me infinity!
[08:25] shaver: hmm
[08:25] shaver: what's the v8bot syntax?
[08:25] jesusabdullah: v8: isNaN(parseInt('lol'))
[08:25] v8bot: jesusabdullah: true
[08:25] NuckingFuts: v8: isNaN('lol')
[08:25] v8bot: NuckingFuts: true
[08:25] NuckingFuts: rofl
[08:25] jesusabdullah: v8: isNaN(1/0)
[08:25] v8bot: jesusabdullah: false
[08:25] jesusabdullah: infinity is a number!
[08:25] shaver: that's Infinity
[08:25] shaver: yes
[08:25] NuckingFuts: v8: 1/0
[08:25] v8bot: NuckingFuts: Infinity
[08:26] NuckingFuts: lma
[08:26] shaver: standard 754 stuff
[08:26] NuckingFuts: That made me lol
[08:26] jesusabdullah: I'm used to seeing Infinity lumped in with NaN
[08:26] jesusabdullah: Cool to see an Infinity datatype
[08:26] jesusabdullah: but idk if I like it or not!
[08:26] shaver: it's not a type, it's just a value
[08:27] NuckingFuts: v8: typeof 1/0
[08:27] v8bot: NuckingFuts: NaN
[08:27] NuckingFuts: ...
[08:27] shaver: what?
[08:27] jesusabdullah: o_o
[08:27] NuckingFuts: That's interesting lol
[08:27] jesusabdullah: Didn't we just show that 1/0 is NOT NaN?
[08:27] shaver: that looks like a v8 bug, if it's true
[08:27] mikeal: see
[08:27] shaver: v8: typeof Infinity
[08:27] v8bot: shaver: "number"
[08:27] mikeal: having an extra method
[08:27] NuckingFuts: shaver dividing by zero results in infinity, which is not a number apparently :lol:
[08:27] mikeal: just to check for NaN
[08:27] NuckingFuts: ...
[08:27] mikeal: because there is no other way to check
[08:27] shaver: every language has this
[08:27] mikeal: is kind of nuts
[08:28] shaver: there are other ways to check
[08:28] shaver: x != x
[08:28] jesusabdullah: I see
[08:28] shaver: the issue here is that parseInt doesn't throw
[08:28] mikeal: that's worse :)
[08:28] shaver: but working with NaNs is the same in every language I know
[08:28] shaver: ruby, python, js, java, C
[08:28] NuckingFuts: v8: (1/0) === Infinity
[08:28] v8bot: NuckingFuts: true
[08:28] shaver: oh!
[08:28] NuckingFuts: Found a way to check for infinity :P
[08:28] shaver: (typeof 1)/0
[08:28] jesusabdullah: NaNs in my stuff usually mean that I'm dividing by zero
[08:28] shaver: v8: (typeof 1)/0
[08:28] v8bot: shaver: NaN
[08:28] shaver: v8: typeof (1/0)
[08:28] v8bot: shaver: "number"
[08:29] shaver: there we go
[08:29] jesusabdullah: v8: typeof(1)/0
[08:29] v8bot: jesusabdullah: NaN
[08:29] NuckingFuts: v8 typeof Infinity
[08:29] jesusabdullah: ah
[08:29] v8bot: NuckingFuts: v8 <code> is no longer supported (except in PM).  Try v8: <code> or v8> <code>
[08:29] NuckingFuts: v8: typeof Infinity
[08:29] v8bot: NuckingFuts: "number"
[08:29] shaver: I wish we could throw from parseInt, but we would break the web into a million pieces :-/
[08:30] NuckingFuts: eh?
[08:30] jesusabdullah: Can you redefine parseInt?
[08:30] mikeal: now i'm concerned

[08:31] mikeal: i updated node on my media box and now this server won't respond

[08:31] NuckingFuts: shaver: sooooooo?
[08:31] NuckingFuts: ACTION is confuse

[08:32] mikeal: i wouldn't want parseInt to throw like in Python
[08:32] mikeal: it means you have to wrap checks in a try catch
[08:32] mikeal: which is stupid
[08:32] shaver: so whatever it returns, if you use it as a number you get a NaN
[08:32] jesusabdullah: Maybe make it take a callback?
[08:32] shaver: v8: null + 0
[08:32] v8bot: shaver: 0
[08:33] shaver: you don't want it to coerce to 0

[08:41] NuckingFuts: lol

[08:41] jesusabdullah: maybe-harmony, shaver?
[08:41] jesusabdullah: See, I told you I wasn't ready for CS research ;)
[08:41] NuckingFuts: Yeah, way more accurate than me :P
[08:42] jesusabdullah: but I wanna know what that means!

[08:42] jesusabdullah: Ah
[08:42] bingomanatee: no - what is with strong and shy?
[08:43] jesusabdullah: Oh, think "and a little, generally un-measured amount more"
[08:43] jesusabdullah: or "and a liiiiitttle less"
[08:43] shaver: http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:value_types
[08:43] jesusabdullah: Trying to squeak that last bit of precision out of a measuring tape that can only get to 16ths
[08:43] shaver: but caution, language nerdery
[08:44] jesusabdullah: I'd imagine that if you REALLY wanted to you could define an object that let you deal with complex numbers, similar to how SubStack did bigints
[08:44] jesusabdullah: but that might be awkward
[08:44] shaver: with valueOf, yeah
[08:44] jesusabdullah: valueOf?
[08:44] jesusabdullah: >_< I really suck at js!
[08:44] shaver: oh, does he have the Java-esque bigint stuff?
[08:45] jesusabdullah: Yeah, he wrote this cool thing that lets you do bigint stuff
[08:45] bingomanatee: so 3 1/2 strong + 1 1/2 shy = 5 flat?
[08:45] shaver: v8: a = { valueOf: function() { return 5; } }; a + 7
[08:45] v8bot: shaver: 12
[08:45] shaver: it's an abomination, IMO
[08:45] bingomanatee: 1/2 strong + 1/2 strong = 1 stronger?

[08:51] shaver: yeah, it's good for interpolation
[08:51] bingomanatee: I actually use rgb(0.255, 0..255, 0.255) in my CSS - I know its wordy but its also unambiguous. 
[08:51] NuckingFuts: It represents a logical thing for colors for me :B
[08:52] jesusabdullah: HSL is better for a lot of things, but I think most computer-savvy people have a concept of what rgb colors are
[08:52] jesusabdullah: and how to think in them
[08:54] NuckingFuts: I still think in HSL
[08:54] NuckingFuts: For anything but basics, which I think in Hex for

[12:09] Garo_: and if not, just install 0.4.1 over 0.4.0

[12:16] jetienne: dve: if you use this one again, remove the old directory bfore
[12:16] dve: remove the old node-latest-install folder you mean?
[12:16] jetienne: dve: yep. but personnaly i would prefere the git one
[12:17] jetienne: dve: git will give you an easy mean to pick the exact version you want
[12:17] jetienne: git clone git://github.com/ry/node.git <- after this one
[12:17] jetienne: cd clone; git checkout v0.4.1; ./configure; make; sudo make install
[12:18] jetienne: this is the procedure i use. i know it on top of my head because i deployed it 3 time this morning :)
[12:18] dve: jetienne: the second method on that page?
[12:18] jetienne: dve: yes

[12:50] malpeli: jetienne: hy! do you know how the best way to subscribe a lot of people to a item in db? if someone change the item all get the change? I have to make a setInterval to check the changes or I have a change event? thanks
[12:51] dve: samar: yes, I dont know for sure it will fix your problem, but general developing against unstable code is going to cause you problems
[12:51] samar: mmmmmmmm
[12:51] jetienne: malpeli: not sure what you mean here. you seems to describe a db transaction
[12:52] jetienne: malpeli: what "subscribe to a db" means
[12:52] samar: i do that
[12:52] samar: git clone git://github.com/ry/node.git

[12:52] confoocious has joined the channel
[12:52] samar: then it download node0.5.0-pre
[12:52] samar: so i want to download version
[12:52] samar: how i do it?
[12:52] malpeli: jetienne: they access the same db item and if someone change the item all members receive the change
[12:53] dve: samar: are you using ubunutu? If so jetienne has kindly created a repository with the latest stable version of node
[12:53] samar: yes
[12:53] jetienne: gozala: thinking about it, https://github.com/visionmedia/ndistro could be usefull. from memory he pack other module as if they were internal
[12:53] dve: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jerome-etienne/neoip && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nodejs
[12:53] jetienne: gozala: so understanding how ndistro work, may help. dunno just suggesting
[12:54] jetienne: malpeli: this is normal database behavior
[12:54] aabt has joined the channel
[12:54] samar: that will override the old version?
[12:54] jetienne: malpeli: as in sql database, as in multiuser with transaction
[12:54] malpeli: jetienne: In real-time
[12:54] jetienne: malpeli: which db do you use ?
[12:54] malpeli: jetienne: mongo
[12:55] dve: samar: how did you install the old one?
[12:55] PyroStrex has joined the channel
[12:55] PyroStrex: test
[12:55] PyroStrex: anyone?
[12:56] samar: git clone git://github.com/ry/node.git
[12:56] alexweber15 has joined the channel
[12:56] jetienne: malpeli: i dunno mongo. maybe people at #mongodb would know
[12:56] samar: then configure
[12:56] malpeli: jetienne: Im using socket.io.... but at the server side Im not getting how to "subscribe" the users to a specific item at the db. How to send the changes to all the users
[12:56] jetienne: PyroStrex: i read you
[12:56] samar: make &&make install
[12:56] dve: samar: did yoou do it as root or using sudo?
[12:56] samar: root
[12:56] PyroStrex: owh.
[12:56] jetienne: malpeli: ah ok i start to understand
[12:56] PyroStrex: I got bad file descriptor too often. -_-
[12:56] dve: samar: do   'which node' in terminal
[12:57] jetienne: malpeli: what is the issue ? the db part or the websocket part ?
[12:57] samar: dve which node
[12:57] malpeli: jetienne: I wondering how to send the changes to the users in async way... without to make the server keep asking if "there are a change?"
[12:57] samar: dve : /usr/local/bin/node
[12:58] PyroStrex: is there any guide that shows how to correctly do file writing using stream?
[12:58] malpeli: jetienne: how to notify that users that are using the same item that a change has been made
[12:58] jetienne: malpeli: first you get the change notification from the db (on that i cant help) see with mongo people
[12:58] dve: samar: do 'sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jerome-etienne/neoip'
[12:59] jetienne: malpeli: second you broadcast the notification using socket.io server. https://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO-node/blob/master/example/server.js#L61
[12:59] jetienne: malpeli: the client.broadcast() is sending the message to all connects clients (from memory)
[13:00] samar: dve :sudo: add-apt-repository: command not found
[13:00] jetienne: malpeli: i checked client.broadcast is working as i describde
[13:00] malpeli: jetienne: that is the problem... I have to send a message just to the folks linked with a specific Item
[13:00] dve: samar:    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jerome-etienne/neoip
[13:00] PyroStrex: is there anyone who uses dnode here?
[13:00] dve: PyroStrex: I am just starting to use it
[13:01] fly-away has joined the channel
[13:01] jetienne: malpeli: then you do your own list of clients
[13:01] malpeli: jetienne: do I build a second table with the itens connections (ho is connect to ho)?
[13:01] samar: dve : sudo: add-apt-repository: command not found
[13:01] samar: there is erro sudo: add-apt-repository: command not found
[13:01] jetienne: malpeli: yes, that would be my first move
[13:01] dve: hmmm...  are you logged in as root?
[13:02] samar: now no
[13:02] malpeli: jetienne: cool, I think this could solve the problem... thanks a lot for your great help
[13:02] jetienne: malpeli: my pleasure
[13:02] samar: but i can log in as root
[13:02] dve: no
[13:02] dve: can you even do  'sudo ls'
[13:02] PyroStrex: can we use socket.io client.sessionId to detect disconnected client?
[13:03] msch has joined the channel
[13:03] samar: it list what at folder
[13:04] dve: PyroStrex: I assume so, if you are using "protocol : 'socket.io'" in your listen config
[13:04] fairwinds has joined the channel
[13:05] PyroStrex: dve: how do you detect disconnect connection using dnode? I am currently using for something like client.name but is there any other better way?
[13:05] dve: samar: can you add the repo manually though Synaptic?
[13:06] dve: PyroStrex: Sorry dude i dont know, i literally started playing with dnode yesterday, so I am still learning too!
[13:07] brian_irish has joined the channel
[13:07] samar: dve  : i open this file /etc/apt/sources.list

[13:11] samar: apt-get install python-software-properties

[13:12] samar: and done know
[13:12] samar: what after that?
[13:12] jetienne: samar: this install the repository
[13:12] jetienne: samar: then "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nodejs"

[13:33] jetienne: dewey_: im not an adept of Coffeescript
[13:33] SubStack: rawr
[13:33] jetienne: samar: "npm uninstall mysql" maybe
[13:34] jetienne: SubStack: somebody was asking about dnode here, like 1h ago
[13:34] SubStack: yeah and then they left
[13:34] dewey_: I can confirm node-mysql works with 4.0.0
[13:34] SubStack: I have dnode on highlight so I saw it all up in my irssi
[13:34] dewey_: haven't used .1 yet
[13:34] SubStack: shit I need to fix dnode to use browserify already
[13:34] jetienne: SubStack: ok
[13:34] samar: mmmmmmmm
[13:34] samar: the same error
[13:35] jetienne: samar: see what you got which is different from dewey_
[13:35] dve: SubStack: Started playing with  dnode yesterday... liking it
[13:35] SubStack: =^_^=
[13:36] dve: using it with backbone 
[13:36] dewey_: samar: on which nodejs version are you and how did you install it?
[13:36] SubStack: I should fix everything tonight
[13:36] SubStack: by which I mean this morning

[13:38] samar: and install it again
[13:39] samar: root@srv56:~# express -v 1.0.7

[13:48] malpeli: jetienne: sorry to disturb you again... Can I broadcast  something to a specific user at the system? Users has some kind a id on node that I could access?
[13:48] tanepiper: browserfy for world peace
[13:48] jetienne: malpeli: socket.io got a client.write for this
[13:49] SubStack: you can do anything with browserify, the only limit is yourself
[13:49] jetienne: malpeli: look at the socket io node README on github. client.send and client.broadcast are in it
[13:49] Plouj: do you guys help with npm installations?
[13:49] tanepiper: SubStack: lol, zombo.com :D
[13:49] dewey_: or socket.clients[sessionId].send
[13:49] floby: Plouj: sometimes
[13:49] floby: Plouj: what is your problem ?
[13:49] SubStack: dewey_: guillermo says that will start to break soon
[13:50] malpeli: jetienne: thanks!
[13:50] dewey_: shit, really
[13:50] SubStack: sessionId too
[13:50] SubStack: on account of multi-node updates
[13:50] dewey_: need them both, will he replace it with something?
[13:50] malpeli: dewey_: Yeah thanks
[13:50] bradleymeck: does browserify handle dynamic require? ie require(x+y)?
[13:50] Plouj: I'm unable to install npm on Solaris i386 for some reason: http://fpaste.org/JqEI/ I couldn't find the "Socket is not writable" in the issue tracker.
[13:50] davidsklar has joined the channel
[13:50] SubStack: dewey_: you can generate a unique identifier yourself
[13:50] SubStack: that's what I do for dnode
[13:50] dewey_: and save the client instance to that uuid?
[13:51] SubStack: yep
[13:51] SubStack: var clients = {}; var id = Math.random(); clients[id] = client
[13:51] SubStack: something like that
[13:51] dewey_: but he will save it too right? isn't that more memory
[13:51] SubStack: more memory?
[13:51] SubStack: it's just references
[13:51] dewey_: if he saves all the clients to, he needs to for the broadcast 
[13:51] sth: I do something similar
[13:51] SubStack: references are maybe a few dozen bytes each
[13:51] sth: Want the source code?
[13:52] FireFly|n900 has joined the channel
[13:52] dewey_: sth: sure, maybe I can learn from it

[13:52] sth: https://gist.github.com/838688
[13:53] malpeli: SubStack: I gonna try this too! thanks!
[13:53] jetienne: SubStack: for broserify, can you do some automatic testing which would say in the module works as expected in the browser ?
[13:53] dewey_: sth: so you're making your own clients object.. do you guys know why he is removing his clients object?
[13:54] SubStack: jetienne: I'm doing something like that at the moment
[13:54] samar: dewey_ : you forget me :D
[13:54] sth: nope
[13:54] dewey_: samar: no, still updating ;)
[13:54] SubStack: just processing the bundled code with node
[13:54] jetienne: SubStack: thus it would be easy to run a service which gives the npm module which run well in server and client... aka something i would love :)
[13:54] jetienne: SubStack: super :)
[13:54] samar: ok
[13:55] SubStack: also I happen to run a cross-browser testing company
[13:55] Utkarsh_ has joined the channel

[13:55] SubStack: yeps
[13:55] xandrews has joined the channel
[13:55] nonnikcam has joined the channel
[13:55] SubStack: so I could probably hack out an api for the javascript engines running on real browsers
[13:55] floby: Plouj: can you give a output with more verbosity ? set verbose level to silly
[13:56] SubStack: with immediate feedback too, that would be such win
[13:57] SubStack: tied together with dnode it would be pretty possible
[13:57] trotter has joined the channel
[13:57] jetienne: indeed, merging server and client is an holy graal 
[13:58] tanepiper: with jsdom + v8, offload all client requests to the server and return correct dom :D
[13:58] tanepiper: (in IE)
[13:58] dewey_: SubStrack: dnode = websockets?
[13:58] malpeli has left the channel
[13:58] jetienne: tanepiper: you are a dreamer :)
[13:58] joshfng has joined the channel
[13:58] SubStack: dewey_: dnode is just an engine for getting callbacks to work on top of json
[13:59] floby: jetienne: it's a pandora box
[13:59] SubStack: it works in websockets or tcp sockets or whatever
[14:00] jetienne: npm package.json contains the info on how to test the module ?
[14:00] stalled has joined the channel
[14:00] tanepiper: Dnode basically abstracts away thinkign about your web transports in favor of doing everything in callbacks :D
[14:00] tanepiper: thats how i think to think of it
[14:00] malkomalko has joined the channel
[14:00] boaz has joined the channel
[14:00] dnolen has joined the channel
[14:01] tanepiper: so basically all your client side javascript calls server side javascript the way you would just write javascript normally on either client or server only
[14:01] SubStack: I don't like thinking about things.
[14:01] dewey_: but the only web transport is websocket right?
[14:01] SubStack: dewey_: right now it uses socket.io
[14:01] dewey_: oke nice
[14:01] dewey_: interesting
[14:01] tanepiper: dewey_: no, it can be flash, long polling or just plain old ajax
[14:02] sth: I still don't like socket.io :x
[14:02] dewey_: why not?
[14:02] tanepiper: it just falls back to whatever is available
[14:02] dewey_: yeah familiar with socket.io
[14:02] mcahornsirup has joined the channel
[14:03] dewey_: so dnode is a perfect way for an api right
[14:03] SubStack: sure
[14:03] dewey_: instead of returning json data with socket.io I can use dnode to call a function and return the data
[14:04] SubStack: yes
[14:04] malkomalko: what's the proper way of deploying production node.js apps right now?  I have an apache proxy setup but I'm looking for some other methods, getting some weird proxy errors in certain browsers
[14:04] SubStack: except you don't return explicitly, you pass in a callback and call that callback with the data you want to return
[14:04] SubStack: continuation-passing style
[14:05] SubStack: because the transport is asynchronous and return values don't jive very well with async code
[14:05] squeeks: malkomalko: "proper"? err, I just put it behind a proxy-passing nginx which serves the static, and node does the dynamic
[14:05] dewey_: malkomalko: https://github.com/LearnBoost/cluster https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy

[14:05] floby: malkomalko: You could run your node app behind a nginx reverse proxy instead of an apache one.
[14:05] malkomalko: yes, I played a lot of craps
[14:05] squeeks: I imagine you would have got a lot of exercise in vegas from the shoveling
[14:05] malkomalko: lol!

[14:07] jetienne has left the channel
[14:08] malkomalko: I really like cluster
[14:08] jetienne has joined the channel
[14:08] malkomalko: don't know if I'm suppose to use it out the box or put it behind a proxy though
[14:08] Nomon: malkomalko: We used to use node-forever + haproxy for production (about 21 processes) but about to switch to cluster
[14:08] floby: Plouj: there's an option in the command line. But the simplest way is to add the line 
[14:08] floby: loglevel silly to your ~/.npmrc file
[14:08] malkomalko: just cluster out the box listening on port 80 in production?
[14:09] floby: Plouj: But silly is a bit too much
[14:09] Nomon: malkomalko: no the cluster is still behind haproxy but only 1 port per server instead of 7 per
[14:09] Nomon: so now we just balance betwean the 3 cluster masters instead of directly to workers
[14:10] malkomalko: yah, that's a big win
[14:10] dewey_: Nomon: and those 3 masters are on 3 different servers right?
[14:10] Nomon: yeah
[14:11] dewey_: and why haproxy?
[14:11] RichardJ has joined the channel
[14:11] dewey_: better then say nginx or node-http-proxy?\
[14:11] squeeks: better question: why haproxy over varnish?
[14:11] Utkarsh has joined the channel
[14:11] Nomon: Its simple and lightweight and it was in place as a left-over from the old days when we used to run php :)
[14:12] dewey_: never used haproxy or varnish, used to nginx so that's why I ask
[14:12] Plouj: npm needs something called gtar, which I can't find on any of my linux or solaris machines
[14:13] jacksonmills: probably out of scope for this chatroom, but how does Varnish know when a webpage is updated if its dynamically generated? timeouts?
[14:13] jacksonmills: triggers?
[14:13] patcito has joined the channel
[14:13] pauls has joined the channel
[14:14] squeeks: Plouj: GNU Tar is part of both Solaris and Linux, what?
[14:14] phpnode: anyone use node.io much? i'm having a problem in that some of my jobs just finish with an "OK" after completing about 1/10th of the job
[14:15] Nomon: haproxy over varnish for simple loadbalancing because varnish is a multithreaded http content accelerator where haproxy is singlethreaded loadbalancer with different inbuilt balancing algorithms etc :D
[14:15] micheil has joined the channel
[14:16] Plouj: squeeks: well, I have tar, but not gtar
[14:16] Polysics has joined the channel
[14:16] Polysics: hello
[14:16] Polysics: i am just starting out on socket.io
[14:16] jacksonmills: Plouj: they are the same thing, tar should be able to decompress gzip files
[14:17] Polysics: would someone please tell me how i could identify users?
[14:17] Polysics: i basically need one-to-one messaging
[14:17] SubStack: Polysics: you'll have to implement the routing server-side
[14:17] jacksonmills: tar -xzvf should do the trick Plouj 
[14:18] Polysics: what i can't fathom is how to hold a list of sessionIds and retrieve them
[14:18] Plouj: jacksonmills: thanks
[14:18] jacksonmills: np
[14:18] SubStack: var clients = {};
[14:18] Polysics: after that, is is just a case of making the client send its id on connect, pubsub-style
[14:18] SubStack: clients[id] = client
[14:18] Polysics: so sessionId isn't useful there?
[14:19] SubStack: well you can use sessionId but that's getting deprecated to work with multi-server deployments
[14:19] SubStack: but you can just generate an identifier yourself in the same scope as your event listeners
[14:20] Polysics: basically, the client will be sending its own id
[14:20] Polysics: effectively "subscribing" to its own channel
[14:20] SubStack: er, no?
[14:20] SubStack: socket.io doesn't use channels yet
[14:20] SubStack: it's not pubsub
[14:20] Polysics: that's why i used quotes :-)
[14:20] Polysics: the result is similar even if the mechanism is more convoluted
[14:20] msch has joined the channel
[14:21] Polysics: i just need to figure out how i can sort of secure the channel to avoid people just sending "id: Y" and receiving Y's messages
[14:21] Polysics: i could store a token on login on the Sinatra app and echo it to the browser
[14:22] Polysics: but then i would have to ckeck it against the DB
[14:22] SubStack: just var id = Math.random(); clients[id] = client; client.on('message', function (msg) { var obj = JSON.parse(msg); clients[obj.dst].write(obj.msg) })
[14:22] Polysics: and i suppose it's not a good idea
[14:22] dewey_: SubStack: do you know, or do you know how, the multi-server and broadcast(except) will get resolved
[14:22] SubStack: or similar, I might have the names a bit off
[14:22] dewey_: curious how you will save the sessions over multiple server, if say you would want send something from server1 client1 to server2 client2
[14:23] SubStack: dewey_: dunno, I'm staying out of that battle
[14:23] Polysics: SubStack: i would need to save the id list somewhere, to allow people to actually send stuff to the user they want :-)
[14:23] SubStack: as I have my own multi-server transport project
[14:23] dewey_: ok
[14:23] Polysics: so it is either generate a token beforehand, or node-js handles the list but it has to be made available somehow
[14:23] SubStack: Polysics: Object.keys(clients)
[14:24] Polysics: i probably am not following you, but how do i know which is which?
[14:24] SubStack: you don't actually want a list since you'd need to .splice() it
[14:24] SubStack: objects are much easier
[14:24] jlebrech has left the channel
[14:24] jano has joined the channel
[14:24] Polysics: i mean, i know user Alice has id 1 in teh db and Bob has id 2
[14:25] Polysics: and they both know that
[14:25] SubStack: Polysics: anyhow just read the socket.io chat example
[14:25] Polysics: how can Alice send a message to Bob, if i store Bob's identity using a random number?
[14:25] Polysics: in the end i do need the clients to tell me who they are
[14:25] Polysics: i have read that and got it working in no time
[14:25] Polysics: but it is broadcast-style
[14:26] SubStack: Polysics: you send the clients the list of all the other clients
[14:26] Polysics: and that is perfectly ok, but "which is which" still isn't clear to me
[14:26] SubStack: the clients don't tell you who they are, you tell the clients who everyone is
[14:26] SubStack: you are the server after all!
[14:26] SubStack: you call the shots
[14:26] amacleod has joined the channel
[14:26] Polysics: but a client needs to tell me who he is first

[14:47] ncb000gt: ok
[14:47] statik has joined the channel
[14:47] daveluke: it does client.broadcast which i assume sends data to all clients connected
[14:47] ncb000gt: afaik, there should also be client.message iirc
[14:48] ncb000gt: if it's a chat room, then you'd expect a broadcast
[14:48] ncb000gt: which is why it'd be used
[14:48] daveluke: i wanna make a jeopardy type game... with different matches.. so if one match has 3 clients, i wanna be able to send to those specific clients
[14:48] ncb000gt: but if it's a 1-1 conversation, then it'd be a message

[14:52] unomi has joined the channel

[15:20] Aikar: note: 'who knows'

[15:21] luke` has joined the channel

[15:21] lakin has joined the channel

[15:22] floby: it has bugs
[15:22] gnagno: Google Chrome 4 - 6, now I am using Google Chrome 9
[15:22] floby: but it works in general
[15:22] luke`_ has joined the channel
[15:22] floby: I had some bugs with firefox on ubuntu
[15:22] gnagno: in the supported browser list there is Google Chrome 4 - 6 but version 6 is very old
[15:22] Yuffster has joined the channel
[15:22] Aikar: yeah, ideally the flash bridge shouldnt be trying to connect to the 843 port and just hosted inline, i tried to recompile it to do that but couldnt figure it out
[15:22] floby: it works fine with chromium 10, so should work with chrome
[15:23] Aikar: gnagno: 6 is not 'very old'
[15:23] gnagno: Aikar, I am using version 9 right now
[15:23] Aikar: gnagno: yes because google bumps versions extremely fast
[15:23] Aikar: 6 is only 6~ months old
[15:23] gnagno: sorry, version 10 right now
[15:24] Aikar: actually 6 is younger than that, i believe it was 5 i used 6 months ago
[15:24] floby: anyway I believe nobody uses chrome 6 anymore since upgrades are automatic
[15:24] Aikar: wish chrome would be more sane o nversion #'s, do they not know what a 'major upgrade' is >_>
[15:24] gnagno: floby, you're right
[15:24] Aikar: no they dont, but websockets still work in chrome
[15:24] Aikar: and socket.io has fallback support to XHR-multipart
[15:25] Aikar: but as flob said, socket.io isnt perfect, has its quirks, but it works for most part
[15:25] postwait has joined the channel
[15:25] gnagno: I didn't use it because I saw there's not much documentation
[15:25] floby: well the bugs I had were related to transport detection for a great  part
[15:25] Aikar: now, since your doing log files, i expect your the one consuming this data and not the general public
[15:25] Aikar: so since its just you, you can use a native websocket and not worry about socket.io
[15:25] floby: but it generally finds a way to send messages
[15:26] bentruyman has joined the channel
[15:26] floby: however, it has some robustness issues
[15:26] gnagno: I wanted to open one window to list a log from one file and another window to listen logs from another file, the problem is both logs were sent to both windows.... 
[15:26] ph^_ has joined the channel
[15:27] gnagno: I couldn't discrimate what to send where
[15:27] Aikar: sio is also pretty simple and follows standard node.js syntax, var socketServer = io.listen(httpServer); socketServer.on('connect', function(client) { client.on('data'{}); } );

[15:27] zachsmith has joined the channel

[15:28] Aikar: but in your case dont use socket.io, simply use a websocket class
[15:28] floby: and be it the first thing the client sends upon websocket connection
[15:28] gnagno: thank you floby I will try like that
[15:28] floby: that's what I use for a multiplayer game
[15:28] floby: worked well
[15:28] aabt has joined the channel
[15:28] Aikar: or implement a command 'watchLog /var/log/secure'
[15:28] Aikar: just pass file name to monitor
[15:28] Aikar: and implement buttons on the page of what log to monitor
[15:29] Aikar: actually,. someone has done something similiar, some IRC wargames. i think mape did it
[15:29] gnagno: I was thinking to release this small script open source if I will be able to make it work, can you imagine developing ruby on rails (or any other language/framework) and you don't need to go back to the console to check the log every request? just check your browser
[15:29] Aikar: youll need security lol
[15:29] Aikar: but what geek doesnt have a terminal open to their server 24/7 anyways?
[15:30] dipser has joined the channel
[15:30] gnagno: Aikar, ok I always have 2 or 3 terminal connections always open, but I thought this could be cool/useful
[15:30] floby: nah terminals rule
[15:31] gnagno: I personally use guake as terminal, do you know it?
[15:31] Aikar: gnagno: it can be, just log files can hold private data so you gotta be careful about security
[15:31] Aikar: you dont want to expose /var/log/secure to everyone in the world
[15:32] gnagno: Aikar, I wasn't taking care about security, anyway when I am in development mode the logs will be in my own machine too

[15:46] floby: gnagno: so what is precisely your problem with sending the messages to the browser ?
[15:47] gnagno: floby, I am receiving the same log message different times for example
[15:47] gnagno: floby, now I am at work, I was developing this app in my home pc, do you think we can talk when I will be at home?
[15:48] floby: gnagno: depends on the timezone ! I'm in France

[16:56] Guest7716: just out of curiosity: any idea how it is implemented in (fab)?
[16:56] SubStack: uses the dotted notation for chaining but same idea
[16:57] SubStack: fab just returns a function instead of self
[16:57] dve: SubStack: hmm.. no dice.. Cannot set property '_boundOnModelEvent' of undefined
[16:57] Guest7716: yes, i got that, just if there is an event to wait for
[16:57] SubStack: dve: oh dnode doesn't traverse the prototype chain for you too
[16:57] Guest7716: such as an http request
[16:58] SubStack: it only looks at Object.keys()
[16:58] SubStack: I guess that was not all after all!
[16:58] Guest7716: how does one chain?
[16:58] SubStack: how?
[16:58] Guest7716: what i mean is
[16:59] SubStack: Guest7716: do you mean chain as in writing a chainable interface or using a chainable interface?
[16:59] Guest7716: excactly
[16:59] squeeks: create an object, and always return the object.

[17:07] springmeyer has joined the channel
[17:07] tjholowaychuk: Guest7716: my advice is not to worry about chaining so much
[17:08] tjholowaychuk: it wont really help you much in real situations
[17:08] Guest7716: @tjholowaychuk i was just wondering
[17:08] tjholowaychuk: just giving my 2 cents :)
[17:08] Guest7716: it looks quite interesting
[17:09] jmar777: Guest7716: chaining usually refers to allowing you to "piggyback" method calls. e.g., bar.method1().method2().method3()
[17:09] technoweenie has joined the channel
[17:09] pt_tr has joined the channel
[17:09] jmar777: Guest7716: it was most recently popularized by jQuery, which allows stuff like el.children().siblings('span').find('a')
[17:10] Guest7716: actually i was taking a liking towards that pattern because it allowed to kind of write modules in a very simple manner
[17:10] Lorentz: Anyone got a recommendation on good book for event driven programming principles and software design etc?
[17:10] papyromancer has joined the channel
[17:10] Guest7716: as being part of the chain
[17:10] jmar777: Guest7716: but it could also refer to various types of higher order functions, like tjholowaychuk demonstrated (where the function actually returns a function reference, yielding the foo()()() syntax)
[17:11] Guest7716: @jmar777 thank you for the explanation
[17:11] wilmoore has joined the channel
[17:11] Guest7716: referring back to what i wrote some lines above
[17:11] Guest7716: is it a good idea to use such chaining patterns for modules?
[17:11] jmar777: Guest7716: chaining isn't really a formally defined pattern, that i'm aware of. in node you can see it used in EventEmitters. e.g., eventEmitter.on('foo', func1).on('bar', func2)
[17:11] SubStack: tjholowaychuk: well it helps if you write lots of modules and have to come up with useful interfaces at least
[17:11] tjholowaychuk: SubStack: what does?
[17:12] SubStack: chaining
[17:12] tjholowaychuk: ah, yeah im not against chaining
[17:12] tjholowaychuk: or promises, just not a fan of the general async libs
[17:12] SubStack: it's not something that module-users should have to care much about I agree
[17:12] tjholowaychuk: domain specific stuff is great, mongoose, soda, etc
[17:13] Guest7716: hmm
[17:13] jmar777: Guest7716: as an example, consider this constructor: 
[17:13] jmar777: Guest7716: function Adder() {this.total=0;}; Adder.prototype = { add: function(num) { this.total += num; return this; }, value: function(num) { return this.total; } }; 
[17:14] Guest7716: thanks, got that
[17:14] jmar777: Guest7716: that would allow chaining for a syntax like: new Adder().add(1).add(2).add(3).value(), which would return 6
[17:14] zylo has joined the channel
[17:14] Guest7716: just specifically as chaining for module interaction, where you would have a chain representing (async?) function flow and every part of the chain is a module
[17:14] Guest7716: like
[17:15] Guest7716: listen(8080).auth().readSomeFilesForUser().andSoOn()
[17:17] Guest7716: anyone having experience with that kind of chaining(-flow)?

[17:21] tjholowaychuk: i dont think so
[17:21] tjholowaychuk: doesnt ring a bell
[17:21] Guest7716: for example saying i have the flow httpRequest -> authentication -> route. now i want to be able to change it to httpRequest -> route -> authentication
[17:21] Guest7716: just by placing the modules at a different position within the chain

[18:12] tbranyen: pandeiro: if single var pattern means no trailing comma to you... sure?
[18:13] russell_h: huh?
[18:13] pandeiro: i notice a lot of code with a new var statement for each require... so that is necessary in node?
[18:13] russell_h: you can definitely have trailing commas
[18:13] tbranyen: pandeiro: no

[18:14] tbranyen: russell_h: well yeah in that case...
[18:14] tbranyen: thats not a trailing comma
[18:14] tbranyen: its ignoring white space
[18:14] tbranyen: to continue the var
[18:14] jetienne: pandeiro: no it isnt. this is just current trend
[18:14] russell_h: ah
[18:15] pandeiro: so why is node saying there's a syntax error i wonder
[18:15] pandeiro: nobody uses nodemon here?
[18:15] jetienne: technoweenie: last time i had to poke isaacs
[18:15] tbranyen: pandeiro: because you ignore people who help you
[18:15] tbranyen: pandeiro: can you paste the portion of your source
[18:15] tbranyen: showing the requires?
[18:15] technoweenie: ah damn
[18:15] technoweenie: i miss gemcutter
[18:15] tbranyen: since i might be being too presumptuous
[18:15] russell_h: yeah, you cant' do like "foo = require('foo')," then just start calling things on the next line
[18:16] tbranyen: right
[18:16] tbranyen: can't do trailing commas in object definitions or arrays either

[18:18] tbranyen: russell_h: issue is that comma is both a delimiter and an operator
[18:18] keltus has joined the channel
[18:18] tbranyen: pandeiro: at a brief glance that looks good, its erroring at the first line?
[18:18] jetienne: tbranyen: seems like the error is not reported on the proper line. add some var in the middle
[18:19] pandeiro: yep
[18:19] tbranyen: jetienne: what?
[18:19] jetienne: my bad it was for pandeiro
[18:19] tbranyen: pandeiro: yeah helps pasting source like that :)
[18:19] jetienne: pandeiro: seems like the error is not reported on the proper line. add some var in the middle
[18:19] tbranyen: esp when you need help
[18:19] jetienne: pandeiro: thus you will know which line fails
[18:20] jetienne: var fs = require('fs'); <- is fine

[18:21] pandeiro: jetienne: so i have to get rid of that first line or change it to a ; ?
[18:22] tbranyen: ><
[18:22] pandeiro: i put some BS further down in the var statement but it still trips up at line 1

[18:23] jmar777: tjholowaychuk: was planning on waiting until connect officially supported node v0.4.x, but if we were to start implementing it, does it look like the port to the new version would be extensive?
[18:23] tbranyen: pandeiro: oh cool remy wrote that
[18:23] jetienne: pandeiro: you split the whole into 2 var. like var fs = require('fs'); var sys = require('sys'),
[18:23] zzak_ has joined the channel
[18:23] tbranyen: he was online a min ago, could have asked him for help with that
[18:23] tjholowaychuk: jmar777: nope, will be minimal
[18:23] jetienne: pandeiro: if after this modification the error is on the sys. i was right. and you have to loop to find the good line
[18:24] tjholowaychuk: jmar777: but I have removed gzip and a few others (although they could just end up as stand-alone middleware)
[18:24] tjholowaychuk: but I dont want them in core
[18:24] Plouj: where can I find an example of two node processes communicating to each other via socket.io?
[18:24] jmar777: tjholowaychuk: cool - might start moving forward on that then. thanks.
[18:24] jmar777: tjholowaychuk: still thinking that'll be ready in the next couple of weeks?
[18:24] pandeiro: jetienne: problem continues even using semicolon -- line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `('
[18:24] tjholowaychuk: dunno
[18:24] pandeiro: /usr/local/bin/nodemon: line 1: `var fs = require('fs');'

[18:30] russell_h: pandeiro: if you don't want to have to do that
[18:30] russell_h: you can edit /usr/local/bin/nodemon
[18:30] russell_h: and add a line like
[18:30] russell_h: #!/usr/local/bin/node
[18:30] russell_h: or wherever node is install (run 'whereis node' to see)

[19:04] daveluke: when the server node needs to retrieve data from say a db... does it do an ajax call?

[19:05] orospakr: Hi!  It's great that npm supports installing things system-wide now, but it would be nice if, if I ask it nicely, it could do the old behaviour of installing into .node_libraries.  is this facility still available?
[19:05] ncb000gt: daveluke: it may make an asynchronous request to some place, but specifically speaking to ajax, it doesn't make do XHR
[19:05] ncb000gt: XHR is a browser specific thing
[19:05] mauritslamers__: I have been trying some things, but ran into a few problems: node-waf configure does strange things when trying to include paths
[19:05] yozgrahame has joined the channel
[19:05] daveluke: ncb000gt, is there something i can google to find more info?
[19:06] daveluke: i assume this is a common use case
[19:06] jetienne: daveluke: it all depends on the database you use
[19:06] daveluke: the server needs to get questions from the db for my jeopardy style game.. and then broadcast to specific clients
[19:06] ncb000gt: daveluke: aye it is, making requests is very common.
[19:06] tjholowaychuk: inspect() realllllly needs an options object
[19:06] jetienne: daveluke: which db do you plan to use
[19:06] daveluke: mysql

[19:08] tjholowaychuk: ncb000gt: the stupid inspect(obj, showHidden, depth, color) stuff
[19:08] tjholowaychuk: since we cant tweak depth via console.depth or something
[19:08] ncb000gt: mauritslamers__: node-waf will only use what you tell it to
[19:09] tilgovi has joined the channel
[19:09] mauritslamers__: ncb000gt: that is what I would expect, though when I give the exact same command line from node-waf build myself the compilation works
[19:09] muk_mb has joined the channel
[19:09] ncb000gt: tjholowaychuk: well look at that, i didn't even know there were more params to inspect :) i've always just used it by passing the object
[19:10] tjholowaychuk: haha :D
[19:10] tjholowaychuk: its annoying to remember though
[19:10] ncb000gt: tjholowaychuk: i'd agree, if there are any more params to be added, just put em in an options object
[19:10] xastey: umm can't seem to bind to port 80 :/
[19:10] xastey: permission denied
[19:10] tjholowaychuk: that is more than enough IMO, inspect(obj, false, true, true) is pretty bad
[19:10] ncb000gt: mauritslamers__: strange, gist or code somewhere?
[19:10] tjholowaychuk: reminds me of php
[19:11] tjholowaychuk: the new indentation for 0.4.x inspect() output is worse too

[19:44] ncb000gt: mauritslamers__: or add your path to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
[19:44] dewey_: small, easy
[19:44] mauritslamers__: ncb000gt: I can imagine build not working... the code is crap, but I have no idea why
[19:44] dewey_: clean
[19:44] ncb000gt: mauritslamers__: heh
[19:44] mauritslamers__: ncb000gt: used the code from node_postgresql
[19:44] mauritslamers__: as a model

[19:51] ncb000gt: mauritslamers__: possibly, i can add it and try
[19:51] mauritslamers__: that is: it is disabled... if enabled, it doesn't work... just installed portaudio using macports, doesn't seem to work...

[20:04] fairwinds: cloudhead: actually I saw it has been reported about a month ago. It has to do with getting broken json due to string parsing in changes. The issue had a fix to implement which I did in the interim.
[20:04] fairwinds: so it is working for me currently
[20:04] cloudhead: ah I see

[20:07] joecorcoran has joined the channel
[20:08] ncb000gt: mauritslamers__: I added an explicit includes bit to the check_cxx call, but it's still not working
[20:10] slaskis has joined the channel
[20:10] ncb000gt: but I'm not sure, i haven't had to deal much with waf...the stuff I did do was very basic
[20:10] ncb000gt: mauritslamers__: https://github.com/ncb000gt/node.bcrypt.js/blob/master/wscript
[20:10] mauritslamers__: ncb000gt: I also don't know whether the PortAudio c++ wrapper is part of the portaudio-dev package
[20:10] tanepiper: fairwinds: this for couchdb?
[20:11] fairwinds: tanepiper: yeah
[20:11] ncb000gt: mauritslamers__: it's not afaik, in /usr/include/ all i have is portaudio.h
[20:11] tanepiper: what are you using for schema?  atm i'm just doing design docs, and most of the schema stuff in the client side
[20:12] jetienne: mauritslamers__: on ubuntu portaudio19-dev depends on libportaudiocpp0
[20:12] jetienne: mauritslamers__: so on ubuntu the PortAudio c++ wrapper is part of the portaudio-dev package
[20:12] flippyhead has joined the channel
[20:13] konobi: wadey: what problems did you solve using your patches to node-amqp, out of interest?
[20:13] fairwinds: tanepiper: I implemented with json schema
[20:13] pifantastic has joined the channel
[20:13] cloudhead: fairwinds: ty, I find that it abstracts the api in a way that I can remember easily :)
[20:14] tanepiper: fairwinds: ahh, so you just evaluate your JSON file to enforce a schema?
[20:14] ncb000gt: mauritslamers__: it configured correctly installing portaudio19-dev as jetienne suggested
[20:14] ncb000gt: still, that doesn't fix the issues with the wscript file
[20:14] ncb000gt: but it at least lets you move forward, or have system level dependencies
[20:15] ncb000gt: tho it seemed like you were trying to include those local to your project
[20:15] fairwinds: tanepiper: a bit more to it than that, but in a nutshell it validates, sets defaults, etc.
[20:24] RichardJ has joined the channel
[20:24] liquidproof has joined the channel
[20:25] fairwinds: tanepiper: I ran into some trouble with that initial validator I was working with, would recommend JSV if you go this router

[20:25] tbranyen: ncb000gt: i've been having lots of issues with waf
[20:25] tbranyen: do you have any resources for documentation on how to use it?
[20:25] malkomalko: yo tjholowaychuk just installed new cluster, my local machine works fine but on my production box (both node 0.4.1) it looks like I got the loop from hell where it keeps starting/killing workers over and over again heh
[20:25] malkomalko: with the latest from git
[20:25] tanepiper: JSV?
[20:25] ncb000gt: tbranyen: there is a wiki and apparently even an online book
[20:25] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: what is the clustr config like?
[20:25] fairwinds: tanepiper: yeah, name of parser
[20:25] isaacs has joined the channel
[20:25] ncb000gt: but i'm far from an expert on it, i only did what I had to for compiling my project
[20:25] malkomalko: https://gist.github.com/4bfe193ad95ece12a100
[20:25] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: it has happened to me a few times too, thought I got that bug out but maybe not
[20:25] fly-away has joined the channel
[20:25] tbranyen: ncb000gt: weird their google code page has pretty much nothing of use
[20:25] tanepiper: fairwinds: ahh found it
[20:25] malkomalko: also, if you notice I have a lot of stuff duplicate for production vs development
[20:25] malkomalko: it wouldn't let me just use .in('development') for the reload
[20:25] malkomalko: whenI started up production it would just hang
[20:25] fairwinds: cloudhead: am doing something at moment that is similar to way I was handling in python. doc.load(db, id) and doc.store(db) but with callbacks
[20:25] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: its kinda hard to visualize but you need .in('all').listen(port) if you want the same portno for the envs
[20:25] lastk has joined the channel
[20:25] mkrecny has joined the channel
[20:25] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: or a .listen() per env there
[20:25] xmilliard has left the channel
[20:25] fairwinds: cloudhead: doc is an object that is extended for different types
[20:25] malkomalko: got it for that
[20:25] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: everything else looks good though
[20:25] malkomalko: .in('all') for everything that's the same, and then .in('whatever') for per env stuff
[20:25] tjholowaychuk: yup
[20:25] malkomalko: hmm, wonder why i get a miserable loop on my production box
[20:25] walkah: isaacs: does 'npm init' work for you on node v0.4.1 ? 
[20:25] tjholowaychuk: you dont need "all" until the first .in() call
[20:26] tjholowaychuk: but listen() before the first in() looks weird
[20:26] tanepiper: fairwinds: i was thinking of moving to backbone and tying request or cradle in for Backbone.sync
[20:26] isaacs: walkah: not sure, just a sec..
[20:26] tanepiper: but haven't decided yet, since i'm using ExtJS on the client side, wondering if it might be overkill :)
[20:26] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: tough call make sure NODE_ENV is set though
[20:26] tjholowaychuk: otherwise maybe it's reload()
[20:26] malkomalko: it is, I do it on the command line
[20:26] tjholowaychuk: hmm
[20:26] malkomalko: NODE_ENV=production node server.js
[20:26] tjholowaychuk: k good good
[20:26] fairwinds: cloudhead: I don't hold onto a connection, but just pass in db which is just a string var for my methods
[20:26] malkomalko: which works fine on my local machine, but causes an infinite loop on my production machine, both node 0.4.1
[20:26] cloudhead: fairwinds: right, but I often do bulk gets/puts too
[20:26] tjholowaychuk: I can add some logic to help prevent the extremity of that issue
[20:26] fairwinds: the base class just uses request to handle
[20:26] cloudhead: the api for that is annoying
[20:26] tjholowaychuk: recursive spawning of large processes is never fun
[20:26] tjholowaychuk: haha
[20:26] malkomalko: can you post up a quick gist as a reply as how you'd rewrite that config?
[20:26] malkomalko: I'm having a hard time
[20:26] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: but tough call on what could be trigger that, maybe fire me the debug() output or the logs in debug mode
[20:26] tjholowaychuk: yeah sure
[20:26] malkomalko: I mean, we saw that that'd happen with the default reload
[20:26] malkomalko: I'm thinking that something is slipping through the cracks
[20:26] malkomalko: it's seeing the change of pids
[20:26] malkomalko: and going crazy
[20:26] daveluke has joined the channel
[20:26] malkomalko: but that's just my gut
[20:28] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko:
[20:28] tjholowaychuk: https://gist.github.com/398599f72adf011a8ab5
[20:28] tjholowaychuk: and if you have prod specifics add another .in() after the dev one or whatever
[20:28] tjholowaychuk: make sure you are on 0.2.3
[20:28] tjholowaychuk: previously reload() would definitely have issues because it was watching non-js files
[20:28] tjholowaychuk: so the socks / pids etc
[20:28] jetienne has left the channel
[20:28] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: got some stuff i gotta work on but ping me later if its still acting up
[20:29] tjholowaychuk: definitely something I want fixed
[20:29] malkomalko: no worries
[20:29] RichardJ has joined the channel
[20:29] malkomalko: I pulled the latest from git and suck it in the project locally
[20:29] fairwinds: tanepiper: trying to get to point where client and server validation for json is same on both sides.
[20:29] jesusabdullah: tjholowaychuk: What was that idea you had that you mentioned on twitter?
[20:29] walkah: isaacs: https://gist.github.com/69e72824d1d3da77fa06 (npm init - node v0.4.1)
[20:30] tjholowaychuk: jesusabdullah: I was going to replace my shell with node
[20:30] tjholowaychuk: haha
[20:30] tjholowaychuk: but
[20:30] tjholowaychuk: then i got bored
[20:30] jesusabdullah: Hah XD
[20:30] jesusabdullah: That would've been pretty sweet
[20:30] malkomalko: fyi tjholowaychuk, the config the way you pasted it will hang when trying production
[20:30] jesusabdullah: The only thing I've heard of kinda like that is ipython's shell mode

[20:32] kkaefer: tjholowaychuk: I know, but it might still be interesting
[20:32] tjholowaychuk: although cd('..') is way more annoying than cd .. etc haha
[20:39] jesusabdullah: tjholowaychuk: Make it so you can use coffee instead of js ;)
[20:39] tjholowaychuk: haha
[20:39] tjholowaychuk: in this case it would be better yeah
[20:39] jesusabdullah: well, potentially anyway
[20:39] tjholowaychuk: not a huge deal, it would be annoying to use anyway

[20:40] niklasfi: is there some event, that fires, when req.write finishes?
[20:40] Aikar: tjholowaychuk: hmm, the idea of building a shell on node that by default commands pipe to bash, and setup commands to be processed by node and have the shell a persistant node process that you can run scripts in seems like an interesting idea
[20:40] tjholowaychuk: Aikar: wouldnt even have to use bash
[20:40] spaceinvader: why even pipe commands to bash
[20:40] Aikar: node> cat /proc/cpu then node> cmd foo actually routes to a JS "cmd"
[20:40] tjholowaychuk: would lose all the goodness of expansion etc but oh well

[20:55] tim_smart: Aikar: Right.
[20:55] tjholowaychuk: not sure how portable it is (probably not very)
[20:55] tim_smart: Aikar: Which module is realpath in?
[20:55] tim_smart: path?
[20:55] Aikar: prolly
[20:55] Aikar: check docs lol
[20:55] jesusabdullah: Then you could be all like, nsh( curl('-i', 'http://www.google.com').pipe.grep(301), cb)
[20:55] jesusabdullah: AWW YEAH
[20:56] jesusabdullah: I should learn me some harmony proxies
[20:56] jeromegn: wow, textmate dies on me since I vendored my modules... wish I knew vim
[20:58] mjr_: Some day, TextMate will just die and force everybody to use something else.
[20:59] jesusabdullah: remember, :wq!
[20:59] jesusabdullah: save and quit!
[20:59] jesusabdullah: There's another command that will do saveandquit too
[20:59] Aikar: jesusabdullah: that wouldnt be valid syntax, id recommend doing nsh(function() { curl('-i'....) }); like i did in nova and call function.toString() and execute the source under a VM thats powered by the shell
[20:59] tim_smart: I just curious if the executed file will always be argv[2] cross-platform
[20:59] tim_smart: argv[1] rather
[20:59] Aikar: yes tim_smart 
[20:59] Aikar: would be a bug if not
[20:59] jesusabdullah: Aikar: a) nova? Link. b) Oh, you're right, gotta wrap the block in a function. HERP
[20:59] rfay has joined the channel
[20:59] jesusabdullah: Actually, you might be able to get that to RETURN a function, which gets executed
[20:59] jesusabdullah: THEN it'd be valid
[20:59] ajsie: im making a request and listen for "data" : response.on("data", function (data) { ... the problem is that the response is chunked so the data is just a piece of the body sent back .. how do i get the whole body sent back?
[20:59] Aikar: jesusabdullah: a template engine im almost done with thats syntax is full javascript. i made a script tag so you can do script(function() { // this code is printed client side }) so you can write the js in a function instead of building an ugly escaped string, but that code is never actually ran in the server
[20:59] stagas: it's actually two different things, the repl and the bash extensions

[21:00] jesusabdullah: AIKAR Y U DOC IN HTML
[21:00] jesusabdullah: AIKAR Y U NO MARKDOWN
[21:00] Aikar: jesusabdullah: cause githubs MD parser sucks
[21:00] jesusabdullah: Pffsht. Github's markdizzle is the best markdizzle.
[21:00] Aikar: doesnt match up in style as its own live preview site or others
[21:01] jesusabdullah: There's a live preview? o_o
[21:01] zzak: blasphemer
[21:01] jesusabdullah: Actually, you're probably right
[21:01] jesusabdullah: I think the gh guys prefer, umm
[21:01] Aikar: yeah if you google github markup preview but dont bother, it doesnt match the sites actual use
[21:01] jesusabdullah: whatever python shit's docced in
[21:01] vnguyen_ has joined the channel
[21:01] jesusabdullah: even though markdown is obviously the best
[21:01] jesusabdullah: <3 markdown
[21:01] Aikar: i had the doc looking ok using block quotes in markdown, but it screwed up on github
[21:01] zzak: to be fair, github markup is a little stale
[21:02] Aikar: so i just converted it to html where i know it looks like the way i want it to lol
[21:02] zzak: but thats only readmes iirc

[21:02] ajsie: I'm making a http request and listen for "data" : response.on("data", function (data) { ... }). The problem is that the response is chunked so the data is just a piece of the body sent back .. how do i get the whole body sent back?
[21:02] jesusabdullah: I don't like RST :(

[21:02] jesusabdullah: but, idk
[21:04] robotarm_ has joined the channel
[21:04] tbranyen: welp
[21:04] Aikar: but i just made some improvements to the system to make it easier to use so docs on hold until new features done
[21:04] jesusabdullah: ajsie: Maybe concat the data chunks and find an intelligent way to know when the data chunks are all chunked?
[21:04] herenowcoder has joined the channel
[21:04] jesusabdullah: It'd be interesting to try nova in coffeescript

[21:07] Aikar: insin: what do you mean by that
[21:08] insin: Aikar: being able to define blocks which child templates can extend and fill in, lke Django templates
[21:08] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[21:08] Aikar: you mean a 'partial' being able to SET variables that another partial reads?
[21:08] insin: That's the first thing I was considering
[21:08] Aikar: i designed this to be familiar to other template engines, you render a main template, and it can include other partial templates
[21:08] insin: Being able to replace or populate an entire chunk
[21:09] herenowcoder: jesusabdullah: it's one of two ORM kinds, the other being active record. I mean a pattern, not Ruby's ActiveRecord.
[21:09] Flybyme has joined the channel
[21:09] Aikar: and you pass it variables on render and then the template uses that render data to fill in dynamic content
[21:09] Flybyme: how many files at once can node read?
[21:09] insin: Template inheritance does it backwards, makes "child templates really nice to work with
[21:09] msch has joined the channel
[21:09] gbot2 has joined the channel
[21:10] jesusabdullah: herenowcoder: I see.
[21:10] Aikar: and i did the collection support for partial too, say you do partial('blogComment', blogcommentsArray); 
[21:10] Aikar: itll print the blogComment template once for each entry in blogcommentsarray
[21:10] tim_smart: isaacs: ping
[21:10] insin: I'm still at the planning stage for my own template thingy - only just got Node up and running last night, in fact :)
[21:11] jesusabdullah: I really need to make some node numerixxx :C
[21:11] warz_ has joined the channel
[21:11] jesusabdullah: Ah, being a grad student
[21:11] gozala has joined the channel
[21:11] Aikar: insin: so your saying the app (ie express) calls a subtemplate to fill in data that a master template users?
[21:11] jesusabdullah: My May/June is going to be intense, what with me catching up on all these node projects I have in mind
[21:11] NuckingFuts has joined the channel
[21:11] hassox has joined the channel
[21:11] Aikar: sounds like the kind of code youd have in the controller
[21:11] herenowcoder has joined the channel
[21:11] herenowcoder: jesusabdullah: data mapper among other things allows for db introspection to get a schema, thus the db itself can be a primary source of  your objects structure, not some quirky db migration mechanism as for active record
[21:12] kuhrt has joined the channel
[21:12] xastey: crap, whats the best way to allow node.js to listen to requests over port 80
[21:12] xastey: some proxy or some sort? since i can't bind to port 80
[21:12] Aikar: xastey: gotta run as root, and make sure no web server running already
[21:12] shaver: I gave node the bind-low-ports capability
[21:12] insin: Aikar: here's an example: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/templates/#template-inheritance
[21:12] xastey: could I use iptables to route it?
[21:12] shaver: yes
[21:13] xastey: cool, now to figure the command

[21:18] mikeal has joined the channel
[21:19] markwubben has joined the channel
[21:19] Aikar: insin: hmm, that looks useful. if you can design up a way in that could be used for my system id try to implement it.
[21:19] pl-6 has joined the channel
[21:20] insin: It's very useful indeed - hard to go back once you've used it :)
[21:20] Aikar: insin: but you could of sort of achieve the same thing under current system.
[21:20] Aikar: with a lil bit of trickery but doable
[21:20] colinclark_ has joined the channel
[21:20] sirkitree has joined the channel
[21:21] Aikar: main advantage with the django is its by names
[21:21] Aikar: but since mines js can include chunks from another file
[21:21] Vertice: tjholowaychuk: is there a way to filter a variable from within jade
[21:21] tjholowaychuk: Vertice: filter?
[21:21] Vertice: specifically i want to print a variable, but i want to filter it through my 'percentage' filter
[21:22] Aikar: like seen in the template i linked, i have var templateBody = partial('partials/templateBody'); at top
[21:22] Vertice: yeah
[21:22] Vertice: as in :
[21:22] Vertice: ACTION :myfilter
[21:22] Vertice:   #{variable}
[21:22] jmar777: tjholowaychuk: what IDE are you using? looks like you use ScriptDoc for comments - been trying to find something with good support
[21:22] tjholowaychuk: Vertice: why not just have a local? percentage(var)
[21:22] tjholowaychuk: jmar777: I use textmate
[21:22] tim_smart: Is there anyway of installing npm modules to a specific folder without temporarily changing the root setting?
[21:22] Aikar: ie: he manually types it all
[21:22] tim_smart: isaacs: ^
[21:22] tjholowaychuk: jmar777: the jsdoc stuff is parsed for doc generators
[21:22] tjholowaychuk: well not manually
[21:23] tjholowaychuk: I have snippits that do pretty much anything tedious
[21:23] walkah: tim_smart: you can use npm bundle if you have a package.json 
[21:23] Aikar: jmar777: aptana 1.X had support for scriptdoc/phpdoc tags but 3.0 doesnt seem to support it anymore, Ive put in a feature req for 3.0 to readd support
[21:23] tjholowaychuk: I dont type "function" for example, just 'f'
[21:23] RichardJ has joined the channel
[21:23] void_ has joined the channel
[21:23] Aikar: i really need to get in the habbit of setting up macros like that too
[21:23] tim_smart: walkah: I'm working on https://github.com/Tim-Smart/npm-deploy which installs stuff from private git repositories etc.
[21:23] jmar777: Aikar: ya, 2.x had decent support as well. there's some limited support in the latest 3.x sneak peek (from a week or so ago), but still not great
[21:23] Aikar: but at work i can bounce between 3 diff editors
[21:24] insin: is there a way to programmatically add things to the current scope? I notice in the REPL that this.thing = "blah" lets you use "thing" as a global variable, but this["thing"] = "blah" doesn't
[21:24] isaacs: tim_smart: not at the moment, no
[21:24] isaacs: tim_smart: but you can change the root setting for just one command.
[21:24] Aikar: i use Aptana Geany and GEdit at work, Gedit and Geany mainly when Aptana is stuck indexing crap and i need to work fast
[21:24] isaacs: tim_smart: npm 1.0 will install to ./node_modules by default, unless --global is true
[21:25] tim_smart: isaacs: So how do I change it for just one command?
[21:25] samcday_ has joined the channel
[21:25] walkah: tim_smart: oooh cool!
[21:25] Aikar: isaacs: we close to that yet? :)
[21:27] isaacs: tim_smart: npm install whatever --root $PWD/foo/bar
[21:27] isaacs: tim_smart: it might work with ./ but i'm not sure.
[21:27] isaacs: tim_smart: i know it does ~/ dereferencing
[21:27] tim_smart: isaacs: Thanks.
[21:27] isaacs: tim_smart: npm help config tells you all about that.
[21:28] tanepiper: tjholowaychuk: seen anything like this?  I'm doing my app structure with cluster like this: https://gist.github.com/ace1e95aa7cc3550c857
[21:28] walkah: isaacs: did you get a chance to look at https://gist.github.com/69e72824d1d3da77fa06 ?
[21:28] isaacs: walkah: whoa, that's lame.
[21:28] tanepiper: cluster starts up, and if i console.log app within server.coffee it is defiently there and set up correctly
[21:28] isaacs: walkah: lookslike a bug
[21:28] daveluke has joined the channel
[21:28] walkah: isaacs: :-)
[21:28] Poetro has joined the channel
[21:29] tanepiper: but when i try goto localhost:6789 it won't load at all, but it does if i just start app.coffee up fine
[21:29] tanepiper: stats() shows cluster is running
[21:29] kiddphunk has joined the channel
[21:30] tjholowaychuk: tanepiper: lots ok, try removing the plugins first and see if it works with just cluster(app).listen()
[21:30] tanepiper: k
[21:30] isaacs: walkah: yeah, i guess i'm attaching new event listeners for each prompt somewhere.
[21:30] tjholowaychuk: tanepiper: if so then we can single one out
[21:30] zorzar has joined the channel
[21:30] walkah: isaacs: wheee :)
[21:30] tanepiper: tjholowaychuk: https://gist.github.com/16215b373b20622a59cf  
[21:31] tanepiper: with all the plugins out
[21:31] tanepiper: looks like it might be a coffeescript issue by the bottom of the trace?
[21:31] walkah: isaacs: no big deal. i was just reading a blog post of yours that mentinoed "npm init" so I tried it. 
[21:32] tjholowaychuk: tanepiper: looks like coffee is failing to set up a repl
[21:32] tjholowaychuk: for whatever reason
[21:32] Ratty_: This happens far too often: [screen caught signal 11. (core dumped)]
[21:32] tjholowaychuk: this is why I dont use compiled stuff :)
[21:32] tjholowaychuk: haha
[21:32] isaacs: walkah: ahh, i was adding an "error" listener, but not removing it.
[21:32] Astro has joined the channel
[21:33] tanepiper: tjholowaychuk: yea, i'm justing coffee in dev, i will compile for production

[21:33] themiddleman_itv has left the channel

[21:34] tjholowaychuk: love all these tools to replace things that work better (make)
[21:34] walkah: mmmm. coffee and cake 
[21:34] isaacs: walkah: care to post an issue on it so that i have something to close in this commit?

[22:09] Aikar: mauritslamers: if ptr = the void*, Handle<Function> *myHandle = (Handle<Function>*)ptr; should do it
[22:09] Aikar: but i think Handles are suppose to be objects and not pointers, so 
[22:09] Aikar: Handle<Function> myHandle = *(Handle<Function>*) ptr;
[22:09] Aikar: invokes a copy
[22:10] kjeldahl has joined the channel
[22:10] mauritslamers: Hmm, the idea here is that in C++ I take a given callback to one function to another c++ function and then call it
[22:10] eee_c has joined the channel
[22:11] mauritslamers: was trying to get port audio bindings to node, but found an already existing project for rtaudio :)
[22:11] mauritslamers: trying to use js callbacks for the callback function of rtaudio
[22:13] admc has joined the channel
[22:13] Aikar: mauritslamers: those 2 lines above are almost identical, except that 2nd invokes a copy of the object, it really depends on how the handles are used, but im guessing that its a very lightweight class that simply points to real objects in which a copy is light and harmless, now if the function itself was embedded into that class then you need to use a pointer and not make a new handle
[22:14] mauritslamers: Aikar: great, thanks!
[22:15] Aikar: mauritslamers: ive not done any C++ with node or V8, so i dont know how the V8 handles behave, you need to look that up

[22:17] Aikar: so you can invoke the copy, or you could revise your code to not use a void* at all and simply do void blah(Handle<Function> myFunc); and pass the handles around

[22:28] NuckingFuts: So that it doesn't suck ass.
[22:28] shaver: how do you mean?
[22:28] tjholowaychuk: how does it suck
[22:28] shaver: JS scope is static
[22:28] NuckingFuts: shaver: http://www.alistapart.com/articles/getoutbindingsituations/
[22:28] shaver: er, lexical
[22:28] NuckingFuts: It's complicated, and illogical
[22:28] NuckingFuts: The fact that references don't retain scope
[22:28] shaver: that has nothing to do with scope
[22:28] tjholowaychuk: hahaha
[22:28] tjholowaychuk: its SO logical
[22:28] tjholowaychuk: and SO easy
[22:28] shaver: other than that |this| isn't in scope
[22:28] shaver: like in Python, etc.
[22:28] tjholowaychuk: just because we do not have bound methods
[22:28] tjholowaychuk: does not mean it's "wrong"
[22:28] shaver: we have them in ES5
[22:28] shaver: but you need to say this.name, etc.
[22:28] NuckingFuts: It's a pain to handle, though.  I find myself having to bind EVERYTHING when I try to do anything Object-Oriented
[22:29] tjholowaychuk: then you are doing it wrong
[22:29] shaver: I don't know of any language where that's not the ase, tbh
[22:29] shaver: in C++ you need to bind |this| at runtime for extracted methods
[22:29] shaver: in Python you need self to be correct
[22:29] shaver: (though it's implied for method calls, which is nice)
[22:29] shaver: I think in ruby too
[22:29] stagas: it's a feature
[22:29] NuckingFuts: I want my implied stuff
[22:30] NuckingFuts: It'd be nice not to have to explicate such silly stuff
[22:30] shaver: but that implied-self wouldn't affect the examples here!
[22:30] tjholowaychuk: NuckingFuts: dont be naive
[22:30] tjholowaychuk: its not silly at all
[22:30] Roelven has joined the channel
[22:30] tjholowaychuk: foo.something is a function, foo.something() is called as foo as the receiver, bar.foo = foo.something; bar.foo() foo is the receiver
[22:30] shaver: |this| is not a scope lookup, which is a bit painful
[22:30] tjholowaychuk: its dead simple
[22:30] NuckingFuts: tjholowaychuk: if I'm doing a callback, I think it can be assumed that, unless I explicitly say otherwise, it should execute in the definition context.
[22:31] mauritslamers: most heard comment: JS sucks because it is not like [fill in any other language[
[22:31] shaver: the definition context?
[22:31] shaver: being made the property of an object should not affect the rval!
[22:31] NuckingFuts: shaver: As in where I actually HAVE the anonymous function
[22:31] shaver: you can HAVE it in a bunch of places
[22:31] tjholowaychuk: hahaha
[22:32] shaver: having { a: function () } behave differently from o = { }; o.a = function() would be illogical and broken
[22:32] NuckingFuts: Because passing it as an argument is apparently considered making a reference, it likes to lose scope, confusing me shitless.
[22:32] Me1000 has joined the channel
[22:32] shaver: what?
[22:32] shaver: of course passing as an argument makes it a reference
[22:32] shaver: you want to pass it by value and make a copy?
[22:32] NuckingFuts: shaver: That I get
[22:32] shaver: it doesn't lose scope
[22:32] francescop has left the channel
[22:32] shaver: scope is not related to |this|
[22:32] NuckingFuts: But I want it to keep the scope of where I defined it
[22:32] shaver: scope is explicitly lexical
[22:32] shaver: stop using the word "scope"
[22:32] mraleph: shaver: he wants o.foo to return foo binded to o
[22:32] shaver: or, alternatively, learn what it means
[22:33] shaver: well, the page he linked is about |this|
[22:33] NuckingFuts: I'm sorry, but I don't understand the difference.  They seem the same to me, no matter how I look at it.
[22:33] shaver: and not extracted methods
[22:33] NuckingFuts: Especially considering every source I can find lists the first argument for .bind() as "scope"
[22:33] shaver: like, it's anonymous function
[22:34] malkomal_: anybody have a good link for a proper nginx node.js proxy conf?
[22:34] SubStack: I like to call it 'context'
[22:34] SubStack: and by it I mean this
[22:34] SubStack: and by this I mean `this`
[22:34] joshthecoder has joined the channel
[22:34] NuckingFuts: Call it what you like, scope and 'this' are closely related, even if they aren't the same thing.
[22:35] NuckingFuts: All I know is that, when I call a method, I don't expect it to run in the context of where it's being called, much less the global/default context.
[22:36] NuckingFuts: I expect it to run where I put it, because I coded it /in that context./  You can't expect me to be working in one place, but thinking in another.
[22:36] shaver: call a method, or call a function?
[22:37] logik-bomb has joined the channel
[22:38] mraleph: you should just consider this as just another (implicit) argument. makes everything clear as day.

[22:38] shaver: the only use of "scope" on the MDC page about bind was in the comments for the example, and I just fixed those :-)
[22:38] NuckingFuts: shaver: ... function, I guess?  There's not much of a distinction made in JS, from what I've seen, really.
[22:38] NuckingFuts: I just want JS to behave as if I had used .bind(this) when defining the functions.
[22:38] NuckingFuts: Because, as it is, I tend to actually use that lol
[22:38] logik-bomb: is it possible to track DOM changes with node.js?
[22:38] warz has joined the channel
[22:38] NuckingFuts: mraleph: Aye, but it still doesn't mean it's illogical.
[22:39] NuckingFuts: *logical
[22:39] shaver: it's self-consistent, which is about the only definition of logical I know
[22:39] Flybyme: how stale is felixge/node-mysql?
[22:39] shaver: it is not intuitive to you, which is a fine complaint
[22:39] Flybyme: **stable
[22:39] NuckingFuts: Sure, it's consistent, but it's consistently illogical.
[22:39] shaver: I think that the widespread misuse of the word "scope" confuses things, too :-(
[22:40] NuckingFuts: Especially the fact that it's defaulting to the global.
[22:40] shaver: yes, that's fixed in strict mode
[22:40] tjholowaychuk: NuckingFuts: what else would it be, its a function that has no receiver
[22:40] mraleph: you can invent time travel, go back in time and invent your own JavaScript before Brendan Eich
[22:40] shaver: where it defaults to |undefined|, more consistently
[22:40] tjholowaychuk: global doesnt make sense
[22:40] tjholowaychuk: but yeah undefined would be good
[22:40] shaver: given that a given function can be on multiple objects, binding to any of them implicitly is wrong
[22:40] shaver: like, if you do
[22:40] Flybyme: is it safe for production

[22:41] shaver: Thing.prototype.method = function meth() { return this.thing; }
[22:41] NuckingFuts: I mean, they provided us with .apply() and .call(), but, I mean, that's entirely unhelpful, since scope/context/whatever it's called is resolved at execution time, rather than definition time.
[22:41] shaver: do you expect that to be bound to the prototype?
[22:41] mraleph: alternatively you can write your own language that compiles to JavaScript and does what you like it to do.
[22:41] shaver: that's unsane!
[22:41] tjholowaychuk: ACTION gives up
[22:41] NuckingFuts: shaver: That's invalid, I do believe, BTW

[22:45] mraleph: I see a person who uses that for recursion.
[22:46] mraleph: I am impressed :-)
[22:46] NuckingFuts: what?
[22:46] shaver: I can't wait for "this function" in harmony
[22:46] tjholowaychuk: shaver: "this function" ?
[22:46] chrisdickinson: v8: var recurse = function(i) { if(i != 1) { return recurse(1); } return i; }; recurse();
[22:46] v8bot: chrisdickinson: 1
[22:47] piscisaureus: it's kind of unclear to me why thisfuntion needs to be invented just after dropping arguments.callee
[22:47] mraleph: NuckingFuts: doing recursion through arguments.callee… 
[22:47] NuckingFuts: mraleph: What about it?
[22:47] piscisaureus: I used to do that often too
[22:47] shaver: chrisdickinson: right, but an object property it doesn't work, and it doesn't work if called by another name
[22:47] mraleph: NuckingFuts: wierd choice.

[22:47] NuckingFuts: mraleph: Why do you say that?  I didn't know there were other ways, besides explicitly referencing the function directly?
[22:48] dshaw has joined the channel
[22:48] shaver: it's just verbose, and unlike the pattern in every other language
[22:48] mraleph: well. you can always save it to a variable. 
[22:48] shaver: now, I'll say this
[22:48] shaver: JS scoping *does* suck
[22:48] mraleph: v8: var v = function () { return v(); }; v();
[22:48] v8bot: mraleph: RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
[22:48] NuckingFuts: mraleph: Aye, but that'd die when the scope/environment/pickle goes haywire, which it has a horrible tendency to do (at least for me)
[22:48] shaver: because it kept me from getting lunch
[22:49] NuckingFuts: lmao
[22:49] chrisdickinson: shaver: ah. i'd just avoid arguments.callee due to the performance problems with arguments.callee
[22:49] chrisdickinson: http://jsperf.com/callee-vs-name
[22:49] shaver: yeah
[22:49] shaver: well
[22:49] shaver: it's gross
[22:49] shaver: so that's reason enough
[22:49] piscisaureus: ok it's gross
[22:49] shaver: if lookup of the function dominates your computation, I'm surprised!
[22:49] mraleph: or you can use Y-combinator :-)
[22:50] mraleph: if you like unnamed functions :-)
[22:50] chrisdickinson: shaver: so if you're doing a tight loop eteration, it could come into play
[22:50] shaver: mraleph: we've had Y.js in the spidermonkey source tree since 1995, I think :-)
[22:50] NuckingFuts: Y-combinator?  God, the complex innards of JS are confusing me lol
[22:50] shaver: Y combinator is not a JS thing
[22:50] NuckingFuts: I miss when JS was just alert() :P
[22:50] SubStack: you can have inline names too
[22:50] shaver: it's a lambda calculus thing, I suppose
[22:51] NuckingFuts: Ah fun calculus
[22:51] NuckingFuts: Waaaaaaaaaay over my head lol
[22:51] chrisdickinson: v8: var args = function() { return Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments.callee.caller.arguments); }; var test = function() { return args(); }; test(1,2,3);

[22:54] mraleph: shaver: does any of Monkeys optimize away patterns like var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1); f.apply(this, args); ?
[22:54] bwinton: I often confuse the name of it with trigrams…
[22:55] NuckingFuts: Because goddamnit, this stuff is confusing.
[22:55] tjholowaychuk: NuckingFuts: I promise it makes way more sense than something like ruby
[22:55] tjholowaychuk: not at first maybe
[22:55] SubStack: yes at first
[22:55] tjholowaychuk: but just take some time, and forget about what you have learnt haha
[22:55] tjholowaychuk: SubStack: not for everyone lol
[22:55] tjholowaychuk: but yeah
[22:55] NuckingFuts: tjholowaychuk: I don't know Ruby at all.
[22:55] SubStack: ruby gets very deep very quickly if you care at all about what's going on
[22:56] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[22:56] tjholowaychuk: its fucked
[22:56] mauritslamers: hmm, can anyone show me how to get a function out of a Handle<Function>* ?
[22:56] NuckingFuts: I learned JS instead :P

[22:56] NuckingFuts: And I'm quite happy with that decision :D
[22:56] n00dles has joined the channel
[22:56] SubStack: I'm rather glad javascript only has functions, even if it has some prototype resolution bolted on
[22:56] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[22:56] NuckingFuts: SubStack: Aren't we all?
[22:56] SubStack: it makes the scoping a whole lot more sane
[22:56] tjholowaychuk: id prefer if that was not there either
[22:56] tjholowaychuk: but
[22:57] tjholowaychuk: meh
[22:57] shaver: mraleph: I think JM does, and TM sees through call/apply, but I'm not really sure about the slice-on-args one
[22:57] mraleph: mauritslamers: where did you get a pointer to a Handle? pretty dangerous stuff. and why to you want to get a function from it?
[22:57] SubStack: if a language can have classes in function scope they should re-use the container scope
[22:57] shaver: mraleph: if not we should, it's an increasingly common pattern
[22:57] dancor has joined the channel
[22:58] mauritslamers: mraleph: trying to get something dangerous working :) trying to hook up RtAudio to node
[22:58] mauritslamers: in this case I need a C function which is the actual callback
[22:58] modular has joined the channel
[22:58] SubStack: ruby gets that all kinds of wrong so you have to pass variables in through (class << obj; self; end).send :define_method, 'x', lambda { ... } trickery
[22:58] mauritslamers: mraleph: and whenever a user sets a callback, it should be called for sample values
[22:58] mraleph: shaver: yep I see it more and more.

[22:59] SubStack: this is part of why I hate classical inheritence patterns
[22:59] ChrisPartridge has joined the channel
[22:59] mraleph: mauritslamers: Function is not a real C function.
[22:59] mauritslamers: I know
[22:59] mauritslamers: that is not the issue
[22:59] SubStack: and in ruby it's better than other languages because you can even do it at all
[22:59] SubStack: javascript++ for that
[22:59] tjholowaychuk: SubStack: yeah its kinda sad
[22:59] NuckingFuts: Despite the scope and such in JS, I am quite happy. A large part of that is probably because the everything-is-an-object part makes up for it.
[22:59] mraleph: mauritslamers: then what is the issue?
[22:59] mauritslamers: mraleph: and the main problem is that that C callback function has a user data parameter which needs to be a void*
[22:59] SubStack: silly beerbot
[23:00] mraleph: mauritslamers: ah. ok
[23:00] shaver: mraleph: why 1 rather than 0 to slice?
[23:00] mauritslamers: I want to pass the user function using that void*
[23:00] NuckingFuts: beerbot?
[23:00] ChrisPartridge has joined the channel
[23:00] NuckingFuts: I don't see a beerbot lol
[23:00] mauritslamers: and check whether the handle is empty, and if it is not, it should call the user function
[23:00] mraleph: shaver: to discard the first argument. because it was used for something else.
[23:00] NuckingFuts: It offline?
[23:00] SubStack: v8bot manages the distribution of beers
[23:00] mraleph: shaver: say it was a name of the event to fire
[23:00] shaver: oh, ok
[23:01] SubStack: I do however wish that there was a way to disassociate an object entirely from the prototype chain

[23:03] mraleph: mauritslamers: well. there is some C++ trickery there when you apply -> to a Handle it unwraps the value inside and -> get's applied to it. Value does not have Call method as well. if you have pointer to Handle<Function> you need to do (*ptr)->Call
[23:03] n00dles: `v beers @ NuckingFuts

[23:03] mauritslamers: mraleph: The Handle<Value> is for the return value of the function call :)
[23:04] NuckingFuts: n00dles use ++ :P
