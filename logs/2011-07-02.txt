[01:48] TooTallNate: tmzt: good question. I'm not entirely sure
[01:48] TooTallNate: why wouldn't you be retrieving an instance of it?
[01:49] carmony has joined the channel

[01:49] tmzt: for PUT, there's no reason to
[01:50] TooTallNate: tmzt: well internally mongoose knows to only send the minimal command needed for the changes
[01:50] tmzt: it would still have to cast it to a document though, but I'm mostly taking the PUT data and casting that
[01:50] TooTallNate: sorry, what do you mean PUT?
[01:50] tmzt: HTTP PUT like a REST pattern
[01:51] TooTallNate: so you mean creating a new instance of a document?
[01:51] TooTallNate: that's not already in the db?
[01:51] tmzt: no, I mean updating an existing document using and identifier or query or _id
[01:51] tmzt: like PUT /users/1 would update the user with idx:1
[01:51] TooTallNate: ya i get ya
[01:52] tmzt: so it would look more like User.update({idx:1},data)
[01:52] TooTallNate: still, I'm not entirely positive on that one

[01:52] tmzt: okay

[02:31] Chani: anyone know how to fsync a writestream?
[02:32] Chani: I might be able to snag the fd and call fsync on that, but, if there was an undocumented method on writestream itself that'd be nicer...

[06:19] tim_smart: attach it*
[06:19] SubStack: it's all just javascript

[06:22] jonmaim: SubStack: simple data from database
[06:23] tim_smart: jonmaim: Got a code example, we can be more specific then
[06:23] SubStack: tim_smart: luckily most connections can tolerate 3k nowadays :p
[06:24] tim_smart: SubStack: I might just make a simple packager with the basics
[06:24] SubStack: tim_smart: lots of people have done that

[12:38] dall: shimondoodkin, ok but is 2011.06.29 node-v0.4.9.tar.gz the last stable version of node ?

[12:44] pigmej: shimondoodkin: ?
[12:44] pigmej: ah ok but it's commented;D
[12:44] dall: shimondoodkin, as far i have understand......github always has the  newest version....and the tar is the stable
[12:44] pigmej: ah ok got it :)
[12:44] dall: right?

[13:43] shimondoodkin: sethetter: maybe you did not defiend your model
[13:43] sethetter: I did in the file I required in, but not in my test file

[13:46] sethetter: Not sure why I didn't do that before..
[13:46] sethetter: But that revealed the problem, it's the testing library I'm using apparently
[13:46] pigmej: shimondoodkin: you got the idea?
[13:46] sethetter: The object it printed was correct
[13:46] sethetter: But should.js is telling me the var is undefined.
[13:47] shimondoodkin: pigmej: yes 
[13:48] sethetter: I'll try running tests through the assert module instead.
[13:48] pigmej: i think it's possible to add it to existing doc-id
[13:48] bbrandon has joined the channel
[13:48] pigmej: but it seems it's impossible to save new document(without doc-id) with additional parametres
[13:48] shimondoodkin: pigmej: the simple answer is you can't, https://github.com/cloudhead/cradle/blob/master/lib/cradle.js#L374 it will be escaped when splited  maped on escapestring and joined again.
[13:49] akshatj has joined the channel
[13:49] pigmej: damn right ;/

[13:51] pigmej: http://wklej.to/TiBXB/text
[13:51] pigmej: but it's for existing docs ;/
[13:52] shimondoodkin: pigmej: do you want it go as a querystring, not as doc id, right? 
[13:53] pigmej: sure but if it will work in that way
[13:53] pigmej: i can accept it also...
[13:53] pigmej: and that ?x=1 is not mapped as docid
[13:53] pigmej: it seems to be passed as argument
[13:54] sethetter: Got it worked out. Something was messed up with the should library, but I reinstalled locally with npm and everything turned out good! :)
[13:55] shimondoodkin: you can check if id contains '?' from the end and split by it and add it later after the escape

[14:02] pigmej: shimondoodkin: he don't have his own lib for couch;p
[14:03] shimondoodkin: pigmej: i mean maybe to look on what he is doing
[14:04] pigmej: well
[14:04] pigmej: he's not using couchdb as I see...
[14:05] pigmej: just some couchapp plays
[14:05] jslatts has joined the channel
[14:05] pigmej: cradle last update is 14.06 (2 weeks ago)
[14:05] pigmej: his couchdb things >1 year ago
[14:06] shimondoodkin: oh
[14:07] pigmej: i wonder why...
[14:07] pigmej: because isn't Mikeal from CouchOne?
[14:07] shimondoodkin: pigmej: in general you can make a quick patch for this for your needs, also maybe it is possible to find something new on https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules 
[14:08] pigmej: anyway it's funny in node.js world
[14:08] pigmej: that most of libs are lack serious functionalities...
[14:08] JasonSmith: Many people from the Couch community feel like, Couch is HTTP. Couch is REST. Use an HTTP client. That has the least impedence mismatch
[14:08] pigmej: most of them works in single db setups etc...
[14:08] JasonSmith: Mikeal would definitely recommend https://github.com/mikeal/request for couch access
[14:09] JasonSmith: I fully agree. I see no point in couch clients. *However* I spoke with Charlie Robbins at NodeConf and he said cradle is very good and I should revisit it. He's sharp so I will assume he is right
[14:09] pigmej: JasonSmith: well
[14:10] pigmej: maybe it's very good
[14:10] pigmej: but... you can't use it with *any* cluster setup
[14:10] pigmej: so it's useless in serious production setups
[14:10] JasonSmith: pigmej: couch cluster?
[14:10] pigmej: am I wrong?
[14:10] pigmej: JasonSmith: yup
[14:10] dexter_e has joined the channel
[14:11] JasonSmith: First, "any" is a big word. Single-write master, multi-read slaves could still work. However you cannot use it "generally" with couch -- totally
[14:11] pigmej: heh
[14:11] unlink has joined the channel
[14:11] pigmej: master slave
[14:11] JasonSmith: sorry, I saw "cluster" and read "couch"
[14:11] pigmej: isn't a solution :)
[14:12] JasonSmith: bigcouch and lounge clusters both strike me as cradle-compatible
[14:12] pigmej: JasonSmith: yup
[14:12] pigmej: until
[14:12] pigmej: you want to change
[14:12] pigmej: RW
[14:12] pigmej: params
[14:12] pigmej: to adjust the performance for db / document
[14:12] JasonSmith: Don't get me wrong, I told the author of cradle that cradle was shit. (This was 5 seconds before Charlie told me who he was)
[14:12] pigmej: and/or security
[14:12] Charuru has joined the channel
[14:13] pigmej: sure that it works with default values
[14:13] pigmej: defined per cluster...
[14:13] pigmej: but well....
[14:13] JasonSmith: I will check out cradle again on his say-so but I still feel super comfortable using HTTP to access couch
[14:13] pigmej: some data needs to be more secure than others
[14:13] pigmej: generally agree...
[14:13] FIQ has joined the channel
[14:13] JasonSmith: pigmej: indeed

[14:14] pigmej: "cradle — a high-level, caching, CouchDB client, not for cluster setups"  :P
[14:14] JasonSmith: right
[14:14] pigmej: result? cradle is a 'toy'
[14:14] pigmej: ;-)
[14:14] kmwallio has joined the channel
[14:14] pigmej: (my personal opinion)
[14:15] JasonSmith: Accessing the local couch on an iphone, android, or webos strikes me as a worthwhile configuration :)
[14:15] pigmej: sure... it will work in 90% of cases very very well
[14:15] pigmej: hehe :))
[14:15] JasonSmith: since those are somewhere between alpha and vaporware, I would reply to myself: so what?
[14:15] pigmej: i just wonder why he splits the id, escapes it
[14:16] pigmej: and joins back...
[14:16] JasonSmith: pigmej: where is that?
[14:16] JasonSmith: CouchDB has one exception to its id rules, which is all slashes must be %2f *except* "_design/". Could it be that?
[14:16] pigmej: https://github.com/cloudhead/cradle/blob/master/lib/cradle.js#L374
[14:16] pigmej: JasonSmith: yup... but
[14:17] pigmej: he doesn't replace slashes...
[14:17] JasonSmith: oh interesting, not sure about that code
[14:17] JasonSmith: yes, my idea wasn't relevant
[14:17] pigmej: above you have POST
[14:17] pigmej: where there is no that replace
[14:17] pigmej: ok forget
[14:17] pigmej: :P
[14:17] pigmej: thta was bullshit that I said ;)
[14:17] pigmej: ;-)
[14:17] pigmej: anyway...
[14:17] pigmej: from my point of view
[14:18] pigmej: id.split('/').map(querystring.escape).join('/')
[14:18] JasonSmith: my own code does: encodeURIComponent(url).replace(/^_design%2f/, '_design/'); // :(

[15:32] JasonSmith: pigmej: To me, a good so-called "couchdb client" is not a translation from HTTP to language X, but rather making things possible which would usually require lots of effort and bugs

[15:37] pigmej: hehe
[15:37] pigmej: in theory 'yes'
[15:37] JasonSmith: In other words, to me, the ideal abstraction or "client" is request: just make HTTP *slightly* more concise and no more
[15:37] pigmej: in practice... not that easy
[15:37] pigmej: sure...
[15:37] JeremyJDKS: Hey guys

[17:34] hunterloftis: Express.js is ignoring ajax requests from Zepto.js -- can't figure out why. Have experienced weird behavior with Connect/Express based on ajax content-type before...
[17:35] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: what's the request header look like?
[17:35] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: Trying to figure that out, hard to see on mobile ;)
[17:35] tjholowaychuk: ah
[17:36] tjholowaychuk: well you can just console.log(req.header)
[17:36] hunterloftis: Yep hooking that up right now
[17:36] tjholowaychuk: not sure about zepto but jquery does some funky stuff at times
[17:37] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: should it be req.header()? logging .header gives me [Function]
[17:37] tjholowaychuk: sorry req.headers
[17:37] tjholowaychuk: grr
[17:37] hunterloftis: thx

[17:38] hunterloftis: I've run into something similar with jQuery before, can't remember exactly what it was though. I feel like the content-type was wrong... or something
[17:38] jelveh has joined the channel
[17:39] tjholowaychuk: does it have no body
[17:39] coyo has joined the channel
[17:39] hunterloftis: there's no body
[17:39] hunterloftis: It's just a GET
[17:39] tjholowaychuk: that's why
[17:39] tjholowaychuk: fuck
[17:39] hunterloftis: Well, 1 sec
[17:39] tjholowaychuk: why the hell do they do that
[17:39] hunterloftis: I just added that content-type stuff, don't blame zepto
[17:39] tjholowaychuk: they set the content-type for no body haha
[17:39] hunterloftis: I did it to see if it would change the behavior
[17:39] tjholowaychuk: oh
[17:39] tjholowaychuk: haha
[17:39] tjholowaychuk: backbone did that too
[17:39] hunterloftis: but it does that before that change ;)
[17:39] tjholowaychuk: looks fine other than the content-type
[17:40] tjholowaychuk: depending on the middleware i guess, sometihng might be getting jammed
[17:40] tjholowaychuk: https://github.com/visionmedia/express-trace
[17:40] tjholowaychuk: try that for a request, might help detect where it's at
[17:40] dexter_e has joined the channel
[17:40] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: haha
[17:40] bogomips2_ has left the channel
[17:41] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: My change actually didn't do anything
[17:41] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: zepto adds that by default
[17:41] bogomips2_ has joined the channel
[17:41] tjholowaychuk: oh :s
[17:41] tjholowaychuk: it shouldn't
[17:41] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: Yeah, I remembered I had issues with that, so I decided to change it... I assumed for GET it wouldn't already be urlencoded
[17:41] tjholowaychuk: GET typically has no body
[17:41] tjholowaychuk: but regardless if the request has no message there should be no content-type
[17:42] hunterloftis: If I patched connect to just not care, would that break anything?
[17:43] tbranyen: heh i've had to use content-type to get the right format back from asp.net web services with get requets
[17:43] tjholowaychuk: i already have if ('GET' == req.method || 'HEAD' == req.method) return next();
[17:43] tjholowaychuk: so bodyParser actually should be ok
[17:43] tjholowaychuk: i think i added that after the jquery issue last time
[17:43] tjholowaychuk: sounds like zepto also inherits jquery bugs
[17:43] tjholowaychuk: haha
[17:43] tjholowaychuk: AWESOME
[17:44] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: in fairness to jquery chances are they do that for a reason
[17:44] Bwen has joined the channel
[17:44] tbranyen: for some obscure opera/ie related issue
[17:44] tjholowaychuk: yeah maybe
[17:44] tbranyen: also curious if thats still a problem with the ajax rewrite
[17:45] tbranyen: the previous ajax code was fuggin oldd
[17:45] tjholowaychuk: oh god
[17:45] tjholowaychuk: and terrible
[17:45] tjholowaychuk: i haven't seen the new api

[17:48] blueadept has joined the channel
[17:48] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: Should connect 1.4.2 work regardless of incorrect content-types?
[17:49] tjholowaychuk: bodyParser should ignore GET now yeah
[17:49] tjholowaychuk: not invalid data though
[17:49] tjholowaychuk: dont send json as x-form-www-urlencoded etc
[17:49] hunterloftis: Right
[17:50] hunterloftis: Is there anything else I should need to do to get this error out then? I get no errors, only a timeout whenever there's a content-type on the ajax
[17:50] hunterloftis: To be sure I'm about to remove content-type from zepto temporarily
[17:50] tjholowaychuk: well it depends, it could be an issue in your app
[17:50] tjholowaychuk: hard to say without seeing code or stepping through with a debugger
[17:50] tjholowaychuk: could be many things
[17:51] hunterloftis: aha
[17:51] hunterloftis: no it's definitely the content-type thing
[17:51] hunterloftis: When I put content-type 'none' (since otherwise zepto sets it to urlencoded) everything works as expected
[17:51] tjholowaychuk: LOL toString.call(arr) in ff 4 "[xpconnect wrapped native prototype]"
[17:51] hunterloftis: But of course sometimes I *will* be posting data, so...
[17:51] tjholowaychuk: WTF
[17:51] tjholowaychuk: browser are so fucking retarded
[17:52] tjholowaychuk: thank god i dont deal with this shit
[17:52] hunterloftis: haha
[17:52] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: thats true for all host objects
[17:52] tbranyen: i think its a firebug issue
[17:52] felipellrocha has joined the channel
[17:53] tbranyen: console.dir( Storage.prototype ) for instance gets you nothing useful in firebug, but in dragonfly/chrome dev tools you get the prototype
[17:53] tj has joined the channel
[17:54] tbranyen: hunterloftis: patch the zepto code so that if you don't pass a body set the content type to none?
[17:54] tbranyen: or do that in your own code
[17:54] coyo has joined the channel
[17:55] hunterloftis: tbranyen: Yeah that's what I'm considering, but since I've run into this problem several times... it seems like it would be nice for express to be able to disregard content-type if there's really no body
[17:56] balaa has joined the channel

[18:07] balaa: hi everyone, whats the most mature MVC framework written with node?
[18:07] tjholowaychuk: i dont get why zepto copied the jquery api, i'd at least take that as a chance to get rid of the bad parts
[18:08] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: hype and follower count
[18:08] tjholowaychuk: i guess
[18:08] tbranyen: i dunno its a very familiar api
[18:08] tjholowaychuk: i haven't done client-side stuff for ages
[18:08] tjholowaychuk: and i notice so many flaws
[18:08] tjholowaychuk: with jquery
[18:08] hunterloftis: tbranyen: yeah mobile
[18:08] hunterloftis: Yeah it's super familiar, that's the nice part about zepto

[18:10] tbranyen: hunterloftis: i don't especially dislike anything about jquery's api
[18:11] tbranyen: seems some stuff is kind of annoying like the data function
[18:11] tbranyen: that can get html5 data-attrs but not set them

[18:21] tjholowaychuk: when i make a change
[18:22] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: yeah that's probably a better idea anyway, I should keep package.json current
[18:22] tjholowaychuk: yeah it will bite you at this stage in the game
[18:22] hunterloftis: yeah
[18:22] hunterloftis: The problem was that I had a connect before the 'if GET' update
[18:22] tjholowaychuk: happened to us lots with 40+ deps

[18:24] hunterloftis: Only took me like 1.5 hours to figure out wtf was going on with the iphone ;)
[18:25] tjholowaychuk: ideally bodyParser shouldn't ignore GET, since you *could* technically have some kind of json query to GET data
[18:25] tjholowaychuk: but
[18:25] tjholowaychuk: meh for now i guess
[18:25] tjholowaychuk: until these things fix themselves
[18:25] stepheneb has joined the channel
[18:26] hunterloftis: Yeah I know what you mean, but I'm happier with the jQuery/zepto/etc working ootb - body on GET is a weird edge case
[18:26] AvianFlu: wow, I wish MY bugs fixed themselves! :-P
[18:26] tjholowaychuk: i dont think people use GET bodies much in practice
[18:26] tjholowaychuk: so i agree for now :D
[18:27] tjholowaychuk: though I prefer not to patch based on other libraries having bugs

[19:38] augustl: is it possible to build a npm package without publishing it?
[19:38] augustl: wanna test how my .npmignore and "files" property work without actually publishing
[19:39] tjholowaychuk: you could probably $ npm install in the dir
[19:39] tjholowaychuk: and inspect what is actually installed
[19:39] tjholowaychuk: not sure
[19:40] tjholowaychuk: though it's pretty typical glob stuff
[19:40] augustl: with "files": ["lib", "LICENSE", "README"] in package.json, why would npm also include every other file in the directory? :S
[19:40] augustl: wait, it doesn't include every other file
[19:40] pquerna: cus... its npm.
[19:40] tjholowaychuk: i dont know if "files" does anything
[19:40] augustl: it does include my "vendor" directory though
[19:40] tjholowaychuk: i've never used it at least
[19:40] augustl: files specify which files that should be part of the package
[19:40] pquerna: how i do it is using a private npm registry... but that has lots of.. complications.
[19:40] augustl: and it does restrict the files to the ones I specify, but it does include my vendor dir.
[19:40] pquerna: (if you aren't using it for other reasons)
[19:41] augustl: tjholowaychuk: after a "npm install", how do I inspect what's installed?

[21:33] bnoordhuis: that doesn't mean the program is actually using 500 GB of your RAM
[21:34] bnoordhuis: but it means that if i read the byte at address (500*1024*1024*1024)
[21:34] bnoordhuis: i'll see the last byte of that 500 GB file
[21:35] bnoordhuis: ehm, is this making it clearer?
[21:35] chbrown: Yeah, that's clear.
[21:36] chbrown: Why does Node think it's going to need 11 GB of space, though?
[21:36] bnoordhuis: depends
[21:36] bnoordhuis: are you using add-ons?
[21:36] chbrown: Yeah. Mongodb is probably the most costly.
[21:36] bnoordhuis: right
[21:37] bnoordhuis: i think that if you run node without any extras, you'll notice that it uses maybe 1.5 GB of virtual memory
[21:37] chbrown: Hmm. I started up another, older, app that just uses pg for its data backend and it reserves exactly the same VIRT footprint.
[21:37] chbrown: Actually, likewise with node repl.
[21:38] chbrown: Maybe it's just some fraction os my available disk space?
[21:38] chbrown: *of
[21:38] bnoordhuis: chbrown: no, that hasn't anything to do with it
[21:39] bnoordhuis: to wit -> 1000     31537  5.2  0.3 639956 12580 pts/4    Sl+  23:38   0:01 node
[21:39] bnoordhuis: the 639956 is node's virtual memory footprint
[21:40] chbrown: Right
[21:40] bnoordhuis: and those 600 MB are nearly all v8 heap
[21:41] bnoordhuis: chbrown: i suspect that one your add-ons mmaps() a big chunk of memory for i/o or whatever
[21:41] overra has joined the channel
[21:42] bnoordhuis: i shouldn't say 'memory'... address space
[21:42] chbrown: Hmm. Okay, thanks for the insight. It's not giving me trouble -- just curious why there was such a large number in htop.

[22:43] Skola has joined the channel
[22:43] phiggins: need to fs.mkdir(__dirname + "ugh") ? normlize() doesn't translate "./" to `pwd` 
[22:43] SubStack: phiggins: mkdirp doesn't belong in core
[22:43] SubStack: npm install mkdirp
[22:43] phiggins: why
[22:44] SubStack: you can also path.resolve(process.cwd(), dir)
[22:44] phiggins: makes me sad. /me writes more code.
[22:45] SubStack: phiggins: no code to write, npm install mkdirp
[22:45] phiggins: would have to install npm, then consider license of 3rd party shit for something I'll just write in 5-10 lines for me
[22:45] phiggins: really? even php has mkdir_p
[22:45] SubStack: if you are not using npm then you are doing it wrong™
[22:45] phiggins: ;)
[22:45] SubStack: php does it wrong™
[22:46] phiggins: so does node, apparently.
[22:46] mikeal: ryan_: you around?
[22:46] SubStack: node does not include fluff
[22:46] SubStack: node only includes enough to write a package manager

[22:46] SubStack: because all that shit belongs in user space

[22:46] SubStack: phiggins: look at all the neglect the core libs in perl, ruby, and php see
[22:47] SubStack: I personally think the http module should be in user space too
[22:47] SubStack: node doesn't go far enough

[23:02] JKarsrud: https://github.com/raycmorgan/Mu
[23:02] tuhoojabotti: I use dustjs, though the development seems quiet
[23:03] JKarsrud: I love mustache.js as a client side template engine, so I thought I'd use it in both places, with mustache.js on the client, and Mu on the server
[23:04] arlolra has joined the channel
[23:04] tuhoojabotti: So what's your problem exactly?

[23:11] tuhoojabotti: Well good luck with that, I'm off to bed. :P
