[00:07] piscisaureus: just curious, what is perceived use of node on a mobile phone?
[00:07] jonaslund: *shrugs*
[00:08] timcosgrove has joined the channel
[00:08] jonaslund: now.. running JS code as is could be interesting
[00:08] jonaslund: but there's a bunch of projects or commerical tools for that
[00:08] timcosgrove has left the channel
[00:08] jonaslund: phonegap,etc is opensource
[00:08] mikey_p: i thought I head ryah say in his talk at google, that it is intended to be a full app framework someday, but that starting as a serverside project, would sort out all the kinks and bugs first
[00:08] jonaslund: (but relies on the internal JS engine)
[00:09] TooTallNate: Yes, I'm gonna write some API bindings asap
[00:09] jonaslund: why not write some node API wrappers for phonegap instead ?
[00:09] groundup: I have been watching so intro videos today from Ryan Dahl. He mentions Net -> Nginx -> Node as the current preferred stack and in the future maybe Net->Node. Unless I only had one application running, wouldn't it look more like Inet->node->node? Where the first node is more or less the router of which script/node to start and the second one is the one that gets loaded?
[00:10] TooTallNate: require('AudioToolkit').vibrate();
[00:10] TooTallNate: o.O
[00:10] groundup: The first node would stand as my vhost
[00:11] path[l] has joined the channel
[00:11] groundup: Otherwise, localhost/script.js and localhost/myscript.js wouldn't work correctly?
[00:11] timmywil has joined the channel
[00:11] TooTallNate: piscisaureus: was really just seeing if it could be done, now I need to find a real use :p
[00:11] piscisaureus: eh yeah
[00:12] piscisaureus: ok
[00:12] piscisaureus: nice that it works.
[00:12] piscisaureus: I don't really see it being added to the app store tho
[00:12] piscisaureus: Same problem for android (plus that your app needs to be in java)
[00:12] jonaslund: with android you need a "launcher"
[00:12] jonaslund: the rest can be C
[00:13] jonaslund: C/C++
[00:13] oninoshiko: Apple's policies seem to specifically preclude it.
[00:13] piscisaureus: jonaslund: are there any C applications available from the app store then?
[00:13] jonaslund: most games apperantly have a small java wrapper for some specific ui stuff and does the rest with OGLES
[00:13] TooTallNate: no it's definitely jailbreak only
[00:13] piscisaureus: jonaslund: market I mean :-)
[00:14] piscisaureus: jonaslund: I wonder how they work around all those different cpus that are out there.
[00:14] jonaslund: it's all ARM based
[00:15] jonaslund: the last portable thingy not being arm based that comes to my mind is the PSP
[00:16] oninoshiko: specifically no language interpreters.
[00:16] jonaslund: even the PSP2 is Arm based
[00:16] jonaslund: oninoshiko: no language interpreters where the code can come from user input or over a network connection
[00:17] jonaslund: oninoshiko: interpreters with embedded code is ok nowadays
[00:17] piscisaureus: jonaslund: ah. I never realized that android apps could be in native code
[00:17] oninoshiko: oh is it? their policies always seem "flexible" to make sure they can nail anyone in a bussness they want to be in.
[00:18] piscisaureus: makes sense though. Otherwise how could opera/ff ever compete with the stock browser.
[00:18] jonaslund: oninoshiko: interpreters with embedded code is ok nowadays?

[00:19] jonaslund: i was writing that it might be that V8 based stuff might not be allowed/possible since the V8 guy here mentioned that there's NX on writeable pages on iOs.. but apperantly nate has V8 running on jailbroken ones so i dunno
[00:19] skm has joined the channel
[00:20] piscisaureus: maybe that's because he has it jaibroken? :))
[00:20] TooTallNate: Yes, jailbroken adds WX memory regions in the kernel
[00:20] jonaslund: ahh ok
[00:20] oninoshiko: it does seems to be a little useless to use an interpreter for node/v8 then limit it to non-delivered code.
[00:20] TooTallNate: I'm pretty sure it's the only reason V8 can run
[00:21] dgathright has joined the channel
[00:21] jonaslund: oninoshiko: not really, phonegap is exactly that. embedded JS code
[00:21] jonaslund: that gets run in the internal browser of your target phone

[00:27] isaacs: they're prettier, but damn... my brain is rebelling
[00:27] isaacs: yeah
[00:27] tbranyen: heh
[00:28] isaacs: and the back button works, which is noce
[00:28] isaacs: *nice
[00:28] isaacs: but now that you can tag an issue when you post it, all my tags are immediately meaningless.
[00:28] tbranyen: that was nagging prior
[00:28] piscisaureus: isaacs: why is that?
[00:28] tbranyen: since it wasn't immediately clear you couldn't tag an issue while creating it
[00:29] isaacs: tbranyen: yeah, but now all the issues posted in the last 12 hours have 3 tags that are all incorrectly applied.
[00:29] isaacs: like, "1.0" tagged on stuff that isn't actually part of npm 1.0 development, but just because the person happened to be using 1.0
[00:29] tbranyen: :-/
[00:30] isaacs: and i probably would've taken more care to name my tags more clearly if anyone had the right to add them prior
[00:30] hvgotcodes: how do i throw and handle my own events? my situation is: http request comes in.  I want to return a response AND invoke a RESTFul webservice call.  Im thinking its better to make that call in an event.  is that right?

[00:33] jonaslund: piscisaureus: i got a bunch compiling on that first run, prolly would need to re-do some of the work but it'd go faster this time
[00:33] marcello3d: what do you guys use to run multiple async operations and wait for them all to finish?
[00:33] marcello3d: e.g. something like a join/waitforall
[00:33] jonaslund: piscisaureus: gonna take a stab at it soon ?
[00:34] piscisaureus: jonaslund: I am trying to do it myself now. If you have already done some stuff I'd like to see it :-)
[00:34] marcello3d: I wrote my own little library to do such, but I'm wondering if there's a standard/popular one
[00:34] jonaslund: piscisaureus: i could give you a big messy patch ?
[00:34] piscisaureus: jonaslund: yeah.
[00:34] oninoshiko: looks like that policy change was in 2009, although I still dont trust apple any farther then I can throw them.

[00:35] piscisaureus: jonaslund: I'm mostly interested in the second part

[00:36] piscisaureus: jonaslund: no but I can add a custom build step to build v8

[00:39] jonaslund: well i did C/C++ so :)
[00:39] jonaslund: actually
[00:39] tbranyen: for js tho, ew
[00:39] jonaslund: i've yet to see a debugger as competent as the MSVC debugger that they made in 1998
[00:39] jonaslund: if you step code.. you could edit code, and continue running stuff

[00:40] marcello3d: jonaslund: eclipse/intellij?
[00:40] jonaslund: marcello3d: atleast eclipse fucks that up.. you edit code and it restarts execution at the START of the method?!
[00:40] marcello3d: that's a jvm limitation
[00:41] jonaslund: well then the JVM fucks it up
[00:41] marcello3d: :)
[00:41] groundup: mjr_: okay, that answers the question. I thought I might have been missing something simple like that
[00:41] marcello3d: java is rarely written in such a way that that's a problem

[00:47] marcello3d: give me html any day

[00:47] marcello3d: by html I mean, let me navigate my docs in a web browser
[00:47] cloudhead: isaacs: ty
[00:48] cloudhead: marcello3d: I'd rather not have to switch to a browser, type in a url, wait for it to load etc. etc.
[00:48] isaacs: cloudhead: the number is the section.
[00:48] cloudhead: gotcha
[00:48] isaacs: yeah, man pages are awesome for stuff you'er using
[00:48] marcello3d: in fact, I usually google for man pages
[00:48] marcello3d: so I can read them in a variable width font :)
[00:48] marcello3d: and use two finger scrolling and whatnot
[00:49] isaacs: marcello3d: if you use vim as your pager, you can scroll with your mouse )
[00:49] isaacs: :)
[00:49] isaacs: but yeah, i hear you with the variable-width
[00:49] marcello3d: not the same :)
[00:49] marcello3d: man pages just feel antiquated
[00:49] isaacs: marcello3d: they're super fast, though
[00:49] wookiehangover has joined the channel
[00:49] marcello3d: chrome is super fast
[00:50] isaacs: marcello3d: man loads troff much faster than chrome downloads html.

[00:50] isaacs: which is nice :)
[00:50] marcello3d: true
[00:50] marcello3d: dunno
[00:50] marcello3d: I guess I just need like manx or something
[00:50] marcello3d: load it up in a gui
[00:50] marcello3d: none of this console nonsense :)
[00:51] perezd: man, how the fuck do I write unit tests with node-websocket...
[00:52] cloudhead: isaacs: so I can see it installed a link in /usr/local/share/man/ - but that doesn't seem to do the trick
[00:52] isaacs: cloudhea1: what's your MANPATH?
[00:52] isaacs: cloudhea1: `man -p` maybe
[00:52] cloudhead: not set
[00:52] isaacs: man does some crazy complicated stuff with file lookups
[00:53] cloudhead: but `man node` works
[00:53] isaacs: cloudhea1: type `manpath`
[00:53] cloudhead: ah ok /usr/local/share/man is there
[00:53] isaacs: or `man -w`
[00:53] isaacs: ok
[00:53] cloudhead: but the link it created has version number and stuff in it

[00:54] marcello3d: I rarely need man pages
[00:54] cloudhead: 0.3.18
[00:54] marcello3d: npm is probably the only app I've used in 5 years that I needed to use man pages for :)
[00:54] kkaefer: marcello3d: you can do "open man:foo" on the cmd line
[00:54] cloudhead: marcello3d: some people like the terminal
[00:54] cloudhead: ;p
[00:55] isaacs: marcello3d: you never do `git help`?
[00:55] isaacs: what do you think those pages are?
[00:55] marcello3d: god no, I google them :)
[00:55] marcello3d: they're too long to read in a terminal
[00:55] marcello3d: it's probably mostly psychological
[00:55] cloudhead: that's why they're run in a pager : /
[00:57] isaacs: kkaefer: bwana is awesome
[00:58] isaacs: kkaefer: i like the linking, especially. very nice.
[00:58] isaacs: but yeah, must work in chrome.
[00:58] kkaefer: I think it works by registering a custom protocol in the app

[01:02] isaacs: cloudhead: what version of npm are you using?
[01:02] cloudhead: 0.3.18

[01:34] nym: Path: simple/test-http-dns-fail assert.js:81 
[01:35] isaacs: drobnox: becuase you're using a version of npm that was more allowing of broken json

[01:59] isaacs: cloudhead: ../../lib/node_modules/golem/man1/npm.1 would be /usr/local/share/lib/node_modules/...

[02:03] cloudhead: yea
[02:03] cloudhead: I do

[02:04] tbranyen: yup
[02:04] tbranyen: haha
[02:04] cloudhead: hah
[02:04] isaacs: that's really odd, though.  it should still resolve the symlink based on where it is.
[02:05] isaacs: oh, maybe man's reading /usr/local/man instead of /usr/local/share/man?
[02:05] hkjels: About mongoose. How would I know when forEach of a find is completed?
[02:05] cloudhead: but I don't think man is the problem
[02:05] perezd: hkjels: why not just use a counter?
[02:05] cloudhead: it's that the relative path isn't correct because of the indirection
[02:05] cloudhead: ie it goes an extra ../
[02:06] cloudhead: when it hits share/
[02:06] jesusabdullah: voodootikigod: GJ on haxxing mikeal's twitter XD

[02:10] marcello3d has joined the channel
[02:10] hkjels: perezd: works, but it's kind of nasty as it defeats the purpose of using forEach over for
[02:10] cloudhead: isaacs: oh I think I see what you mean
[02:11] perezd: hkjels: thats true, it does defeat it
[02:11] cloudhead: cause depending on how you navigate to it, it'll have a different path

[02:12] dizzdiamonds has joined the channel
[02:13] dizzdiamonds: hello, I just installed npm on a fresh mac install and I cannot execute installed modules ie. express
[02:13] isaacs: dizzdiamonds: what versions?  how did you install node?
[02:13] dizzdiamonds: npm 1.0.1rc7
[02:13] dizzdiamonds: i installed node from the github instructions
[02:14] dizzdiamonds: node is version 0.4.5
[02:14] isaacs: dizzdiamonds: ok.  when you do `npm install express` in your project, you can do `require("express")`
[02:14] cloudhead: isaacs: but I think the symlink is based on the real path, not the symed path
[02:14] dgathright has joined the channel
[02:14] isaacs: dizzdiamonds: if you want to run the express bin, then do `npm install express -g` to install it globally

[02:19] jesusabdullah: What does THAT do?
[02:19] marcello3d: it's kinda silly, but for simple stuff, JSON.parse(readSync()) and writeSync(JSON.stringify(object)) should be a good starting point
[02:20] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[02:20] cloudhead: isaacs: if I do `readlink -f ../../../` from the man1 dir, it returns /usr, so I guess that's the deal
[02:20] bingomanatee: Hows my nodelings?
[02:20] jschuur: marcello3d: Hmm. I'll check that out actually. It's a single user app with not a lot of data anyway.
[02:20] isaacs: cloudhea1: are you in /usr/local/share/man/man1, or /usr/local/man/man1 when you do that?
[02:21] isaacs: dizzdiamonds: http://blog.nodejs.org/2011/03/23/npm-1-0-global-vs-local-installation/
[02:21] bingomanatee: Hey marcello3D - I am having some issues with Mongoose - I might be giving Mongolian DeadBeef a spin this week. 
[02:21] cloudhead: isaacs: both return the same thing
[02:21] isaacs: dizzdiamonds: read that^ it answers your question
[02:21] isaacs: cloudhea1: um... that's really crazy and weird, then
[02:21] isaacs: because that's not what readlink does
[02:22] marcello3d: jschuur: if you want a little bit of robustness, you can rename the existing file before you save
[02:22] cloudhead: isaacs: cause I'm guessing it resolves the real path, without taking into account any symlinks in the path
[02:22] bingomanatee: jschur: mongo and couch seem to be the registries of choice in the community. 
[02:22] cloudhead: or maybe `cd` does that idk
[02:22] marcello3d: bingomanatee: awesome :)
[02:22] bingomanatee: jschuur ^ with redis being another popular choice. 
[02:22] jschuur: bingomanatee: Ordinarily I'd go with that too, but I wanted something that doesn't require a separate database process.
[02:22] bingomanatee: I'll let you know how things go. 
[02:22] isaacs: cloudhea1: readlink doesn't resolve a real path
[02:22] isaacs: cloudhea1: pwd -P does
[02:23] bingomanatee: ??? 
[02:23] bingomanatee: jschuur: I have no idea what you mean. 
[02:23] marcello3d: bingomanatee: just remember it's super experimental, so no complaining :D
[02:23] cloudhead: isaacs: yea I just tried that, it returns /usr/local/man/man1 from share/man/man1
[02:23] marcello3d: well, complaining is welcome, but don't get upset :D
[02:23] bingomanatee: too bad. Its on git. I get to complain.
[02:23] isaacs: cloudhea1: yeah, pwd -P should do that
[02:23] bingomanatee: ACTION is already upset.
[02:23] cloudhead: the symlinks must work that way too?
[02:24] cloudhead: ie they're based on pwd -P
[02:24] marcello3d: I'm actually reworking the gridfs stuff right now
[02:24] jschuur: bingomanatee: I don't want the overhead of a DB solution that requires a DB server. sqlite e.g. works off of a file and the library/driver reads straight from it
[02:24] marcello3d: but I've reached a point where I have two parallel async operations
[02:24] marcello3d: that I want to bring down to a single op
[02:24] bingomanatee: hopefully its small enogugh and my mongo-native knowledge is big enough that I should be able topatch any problems myself. 
[02:24] drobnox: whart's the latest greatest npm? I just upgraded to 3.1.8
[02:24] marcello3d: bingomanatee: yea, I don't think you'll have trouble
[02:25] bingomanatee: jschuur: well, I'm sure that makes sense to you. I can't see what the problem is unless your native environment is a linux based digital watch, but there's a solution out there for everyeone. 
[02:25] isaacs: drobnox: no, you updated to 0.3.18
[02:25] warreng has joined the channel
[02:25] isaacs: drobnox: it's 1.0 rc
[02:26] drobnox: quick way to get to 1.0 rc? git?
[02:26] marcello3d: drobnox: read the readme
[02:26] jschuur: I'm not constrained per se, but it's a project that more users might want to install their own instance of, and requiring them to also install a DB server is just another hurdle. 
[02:26] marcello3d: there's a commandline option for installing rc
[02:27] marcello3d: jschuur: what kind of data is it?
[02:27] bingomanatee: i've already reverted to a very simple model system I wrote based on native that has simple wrappers for get, put, find, insert, and update. 
[02:27] timcosgrove has joined the channel
[02:27] marcello3d: bingomanatee: on mongo?

[02:27] Aikar: hmm
[02:28] timcosgrove has left the channel
[02:28] drobnox: thx all...working it
[02:28] jschuur: marcello3d: In short, it's a list of URLs or files that a user has uploaded, some statuses associated with them and some config settings that can be toggled from the app.
[02:28] Aikar: https://github.com/aikar/wormhole/blob/master/src/wormhole.cc#L61
[02:28] isaacs: drobnox: http://groups.google.com/group/npm-/browse_thread/thread/43d3e76d71d1f141
[02:28] marcello3d: jschuur: is it something you could reasonably keep all in memory?
[02:28] Aikar: does anyone see anything obviously wrong with my code here?
[02:28] bingomanatee: its really not that sophisticated - its just a few utility wrappers for basic collection based IO. 
[02:28] Aikar: im having memory corruption issues 
[02:29] jschuur: Hmm. Now that I think about it, the URLs turn into files. I could just browse all the files in the upload dir.
[02:29] Aikar: am i getting the raw buffer out correctly?
[02:29] jschuur: But I still need settings per file
[02:29] marcello3d: jschuur: I'd just use json files
[02:29] marcello3d: keep it simple
[02:29] bingomanatee: the only really interesting thiing it does is allows you to use callbacks to ensure that you don't do any model based operations til the database is connected to. 
[02:29] Aikar: i replaced char* data with char realdata[6] = {0xa5, 0x68, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f}; char* data = (char*)&realdata; size_t len = 6; and its not crashing
[02:29] jschuur: marcello3d: There's no reason not to keep it in memory. It's not that big of a deal if the status data is lost.
[02:30] jschuur: marcello3d: Yeah, I'm looking that up right now, thanks.
[02:30] bingomanatee: jschuur: there is nothing wrong with using local JSON based repos for transient session based stuff and files for persistence. 
[02:30] jschuur: I just started experimenting with node today. I mostly write Rails code.
[02:31] bingomanatee: Databases are necesary if your data grows to a significant size, and/or you need graph operations, but not all apps have those demands on their critical path. 
[02:31] jschuur: bingomanatee: Is there a module that simplifies the handling or is the core JSON support enough?
[02:31] bingomanatee: I can't imagine how it could. JSON is native to javascript. 
[02:31] jschuur: We're talking a few dozen to a hundred rows of data really
[02:32] bingomanatee: there is JSON.stirngify() and JSON.parse() - that is again, essentially core Javascript 
[02:32] bingomanatee: ^ ^ stringify
[02:32] marcello3d: core JSON is enough
[02:32] marcello3d: it can even pretty-print if you want human readable output
[02:32] bingomanatee: for serializing and deserializing strings to JSON and vice versa. 
[02:32] marcello3d: by pretty-print I mean indent
[02:33] jschuur: Gotcha. That sounds like it takes care of my serialization
[02:33] bingomanatee: really? how do you pretty print JSON?
[02:33] marcello3d: JSON.stringify(object,null,2)
[02:33] marcello3d: I think
[02:33] bingomanatee: cool!
[02:33] marcello3d: v8: JSON.stringify({a:1,b:[1,2]},null,2)
[02:33] v8bot: marcello3d: "{\n  \"a\": 1,\n  \"b\": [\n    1,\n    2\n  ]\n}"
[02:33] marcello3d: yep
[02:33] bingomanatee: jschuur: look at the expres.js examples of how TJ uses local repos for data . 
[02:34] jschuur: I'm actually already using stringify in the API portion of the prototype
[02:34] marcello3d: v8: console.log(JSON.stringify({a:1,b:[1,2]},null,2))
[02:34] v8bot: marcello3d: "{\n  \"a\": 1,\n  \"b\": [\n    1,\n    2\n  ]\n}"

[02:35] bingomanatee: yup thanks. 
[02:35] marcello3d: 2 is the amount of indent
[02:35] piscisaureus: what is the best irc library for node.js?
[02:35] micheil: hvgotcodes: request.on('error') I think.
[02:35] bingomanatee: what is the second parameter?
[02:35] marcello3d: it's for transforming objects
[02:35] micheil: piscisaureus: probably the one on npm, I only know of one.
[02:35] piscisaureus: there are several in npm. Which one you know about?
[02:35] hvgotcodes: micheil: yeah thats it
[02:36] marcello3d: http://www.json.org/js.html look for "replacer"
[02:36] jschuur: I guess when I was asking about another module earlier, I meant something that provides model support. Exxpress doesn't seem to do that.
[02:36] micheil: marcello3d: you're better looking in the ES5 reference
[02:36] marcello3d: v8: JSON.stringify({a:1,b:[1,2]},2)

[02:37] marcello3d: shrug
[02:37] marcello3d: it still works =P
[02:37] jschuur: bingomanatee: You were referring to the blog example on the express github repo?
[02:37] marcello3d: mdc reference is pretty good
[02:37] marcello3d: and usually the same as v8
[02:37] AAA_awright: I use git://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc.git
[02:37] marcello3d: and it says when it isn't
[02:37] bingomanatee: yup
[02:38] AAA_awright: Which is https://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc
[02:39] bingomanatee: BTW I have extended the MVC example of express into a tiny framework with parameter driven form generation, mongoose for a model and controllers from the express.js example - I use it for my projects. Its a good jumpoff point for people from the MVC world (Rails/Zend Framework et all)
[02:40] jschuur: bingomanatee: I'll take a look at that, sure.
[02:40] jschuur: I'm not really sure this project needs the async benefits of node anymore, but what the heck, it's a nice way to learn.
[02:40] bingomanatee: I honestly think that Mongo and Couch are both the most sensible store to use with Node. They both esssentially store keyed JSON files, and Couch even stores them via REST so you don't really need an ORM as such to use it .
[02:41] hvgotcodes: im getting a connection refused when trying to connect to couchdb from node - is there anything obviously wrong with this https://gist.github.com/00f753ce63ed3ee564e3?

[02:41] jschuur: I've never used a document based system before. I haven't done a ton of Rails either, and ActiveRecord abstracts the DB layer away from me nicely.
[02:41] bingomanatee: The first project I used Node on had 30% of teh memory impact of teh same task done in PHP and I'd been using PHP for years. 
[02:42] cloudhead: isaacs: so I just deleted the symlink, and moved the man dir there, and all the links work now
[02:42] jschuur: Yeah, I'm mainly doing it in Node, so I can stick it on a free or very cheap VM that doesn't have a lot of memory 
[02:42] bingomanatee: With JSON stores you don't really need much abstraction. You store things in a useful tree of values directly in the repository. 
[02:42] cloudhead: isaacs: but maybe absolute paths would be more bulletproof in the future, idk
[02:42] bingomanatee: Well you can use Couch over the web - Couch has free database hosting so you can lean on a remote repo for Couch and not hit your VM's memory or file system at all.
[02:43] bingomanatee: Mongo has similar offerings but Couch is probably a much easier system to "get" if you are new to noSQL
[02:44] jschuur: Ah. Did not realize that.
[02:45] bingomanatee: i take it you "Get" REST from having used Ruby?
[02:45] jschuur: Yeah.

[02:46] bingomanatee: You can simply REST JSON data straight to a Couch repo - and the nice thing you can even attach files - images, text, binary data - a subcomponents of a document the same way. 
[02:47] jschuur: It introduces another external dependency for this app though. And I'd like the user to know their data is under their control locally. But for another app I'll check that out, thanks.
[02:48] bingomanatee: You'll be glad you did. 
[02:48] bingomanatee: there's no reason not to set up a couch system locally, other than your wimpy VM.
[02:49] jschuur: I'm basically managing torrent files to queue and kick off a client from another location. And some people might not always use it for entirely legit purposes.

[03:45] marcello3d: alright
[03:45] marcello3d: well
[03:45] marcello3d: what do you think it's for?
[03:45] marcello3d: because I'm probably not the best person to describe it
[03:46] jschuur: Well, keep in mind I have about a day's worth of node experience.
[03:46] marcello3d: even better
[03:47] jschuur: I thought node was already capable of responding asynchronously (kind of, still in a single thread).
[03:47] jschuur: While on connection's session waits for the next event listener to fire based on whatever, Node can still deal with another connection, right?
[03:48] marcello3d: how about this:
[03:48] beawesomeinstead has joined the channel
[03:48] beawesomeinstead has joined the channel
[03:48] marcello3d: A simple way to wait for multiple asynchronous calls to return in Node.js.
[03:48] matyr has joined the channel
[03:49] jschuur: You're still describing the solution though. Explain the problem to potential users too.
[03:49] marcello3d: so the problem is you have some code you need to run
[03:49] marcello3d: and it depends on the results of 3 different asynchronous calls
[03:50] marcello3d: while you could nest them inside each other (run one, get its value, run the next, get its value, etc)
[03:50] bentkus has joined the channel
[03:50] marcello3d: you may want to run them at the same time
[03:50] jschuur: Ah, so it's for the same user connection (client session e.g.)?
[03:50] marcello3d: imagine it's not even a webapp
[03:51] marcello3d: just some commandline app you're writing
[03:51] jschuur: And you wouldn't care about what order they run?
[03:51] marcello3d: and you want to, say, call 10 different REST services on the web
[03:51] marcello3d: to get some data back
[03:51] k1ttty has joined the channel
[03:51] jschuur: Is it a way to fire a final event when they're all done e.g.?
[03:51] marcello3d: right, this is for the situation where you don't care about order
[03:51] marcello3d: yep
[03:52] marcello3d: as well as put the return values somewhere useful
[03:52] jschuur: Ah. I kind of assumed aside from knowing when everything is done, that node already worked that way if you just set up a bunch of event listeners
[03:52] jschuur: So there's you're hook: Explain that it's good for notifying you when a bunch of calls have all completed.

[05:18] gtramont1na: Cool. Does to have a different exit code when tests fail?
[05:19] gtramont1na: I mean, when we call "vows tests/*" and all tests are green vs. when some tests are red

[05:21] spencert: hi, there
[05:21] spencert: i am using, https://github.com/loggly/collectd-to-graphite/blob/master/collectd-graphite-proxy.js
[05:22] cloudhead: gtramont1na: yes
[05:22] spencert: and for whatever reason it does not seem to be executing correctly on this line
[05:22] gtramont1na: Awesome! This makes things way easier! ;-)
[05:22] spencert: var m = putval_re.exec(metrics[i]);
[05:23] spencert: for whatever reason when i do a console.log(m)  after that line, it always returns null
[05:26] spencert: any regex experts out there...
[05:28] sako: hey guys so i dont understand how you can incorporate a template engine with node.js
[05:28] sako: i was looking at handlebars, since i love django templates and it seems to be closest 
[05:28] jimt_ has joined the channel
[05:29] cloudhead: gtramont1na: cool, let me know if you have any issues
[05:29] gtramont1na: Will do! ;-)
[05:30] cloudhead: spencert: maybe I can help
[05:30] gtramont1na: sako: are you using any web framework? E.g. express?
[05:30] spencert: couldhead: great, here is the incoming stream...
[05:31] spencert: PUTVAL tops-026-204.d.usys.fsglobal.net/cpu-3/cpu-softirq interval=6.000 1302499820.434:0
[05:31] cloudhead: ok and what do you need
[05:32] rvaj has joined the channel
[05:32] ryan0x2 has joined the channel
[05:32] spencert: if you look at this: https://github.com/loggly/collectd-to-graphite/blob/master/collectd-graphite-proxy.js you will see it looks for 4 elements
[05:32] cloudhead: yea
[05:33] gtramont1na: sako: If you are using Express.js, there is an adapter for handlebars here http://github.com/donpark/hbs
[05:34] spencert: in the end i need something to feed to graphite, i can get the stream all cleaned up and sent to graphite once i get it chopped up into the bits i need, 
[05:34] spencert: this regex is hurting my brain
[05:35] spencert: plus its too late on a sunday to be looking at this :-)
[05:35] cloudhead: ok so what parts do you need separated?
[05:35] cloudhead: the host, the interval and ..
[05:36] sako: gtramont1na: thanks!
[05:36] sako: gtramont1na: i am planning on using express yes..
[05:36] mike_miller has joined the channel
[05:36] spencert: i need host, the stuff after the / I call it the metric name, dont need the interval section, but i do need the timestamp and the value after it, the .434

[05:39] matyr_ has joined the channel
[05:40] spencert: woot! cloudhead, that did it
[05:40] cloudhead: cool
[05:40] cloudhead: also, you can replace all the [^ ] bits with \S
[05:40] sako: hmm doesnt look like handlebars + express is too common?
[05:40] sako: what are people using with express (template enginewise)
[05:40] spencert: cloudhead: ok, i will try that also, 
[05:40] cloudhead: sako: probably jade
[05:41] shaunau: sako: i've been playing with jqtpl
[05:41] SubStack: jade and haml seem to be rather common
[05:41] SubStack: I've seen some handlebar use too
[05:41] sako: haml sucks :/
[05:41] sako: i refuse lol
[05:41] sako: let me check out jade
[05:42] spencert: cloudhead: you are correct, that replacement works perfectly also
[05:42] sako: ugh jade is weak too.. whats so hard about html that people need to keep messing with it?

[05:44] JimBastard: cloudhead in the house
[05:44] JimBastard: and indexzero 
[05:44] JimBastard: its a regular fucking javascript party!
[05:45] JimBastard: :-D
[05:45] cloudhead: spencert: as opposed to \s which is kinda like [ \n]
[05:45] cloudhead: JimBastard: yow
[05:45] spencert: ah, i was googling and finding \s was space, did not do the login in my head. 
[05:46] cloudhead: yeh
[05:46] spencert: s/login/logic/
[05:47] spencert: excellent, thank you for helping, this is pretty sweet stuff this node, i have it in between collectd, and graphite. takes the data from collectd and stores it in graphite for graphs

[08:08] f7u12: JimBastard: okay great, thank you. One last question: Will I need to re-install NPM etc. if I rebuild node
[08:08] jetienne: f7u12: stay in stable branch, unless you are ready to experience bugs

[08:15] indutny: V1: yep
[08:16] indutny: V1: but I'm looking in this
[08:16] jetienne: f7u12: 0.4.5 is the current stable. http://blog.nodejs.org/2011/04/02/node-v0-4-5/

[09:35] V1: indutny: You do have point there

[10:09] V1: indutny: the npn patch is already included in the latest openssl build, see changelog http://www.openssl.org/news/changelog.html
[10:09] indutny: V1: yep, that's what I'm talking about
[10:10] indutny: but f.e. ubuntu package has only 0.9.7 version ATM
[10:10] V1: time to compile from source :)
[10:11] rubydiamond_: tmedema: which language
[10:11] rubydiamond_: ppl will code in
[10:11] tmedema: rubydiamond_: javascript of course, for node.js
[10:11] V1: indutny: but there probably should be some way to add that functionality without having to upgrade openSSL
[10:12] tmedema: rubydiamond_: it'd probably the most immense demo project ever created though ^^
[10:12] indutny: V1: Most part of NPN is extension to ClientHello and ServerHello
[10:12] indutny: V1: Which are fundamental in SSL
[10:12] indutny: V1: I think that can't be easily extended
[10:12] indutny: V1: w/o upgrading openssl
[10:13] V1: indutny: That kinda sucks.. But that would also mean.. that the SPDY flipserver doesn't work if you have openssl < 1.0
[10:13] tmedema: rubydiamond_: another thing that'd be cool, is a RIA where people can browse the web together
[10:13] rubydiamond_: tmedema: I want to build it in a day
[10:13] indutny: V1: nice point
[10:13] indutny: V1: probably it will work only in force mode

[10:15] deebo: AAC encoder
[10:15] deebo: so i can use it
[10:16] V1: indutny: idk, I don't have access to my flipserver @ home ;(
[10:16] tmedema: rubydiamond_: let people browse the web together, everyone gets 30 seconds of browsing with a big counter to show off their most liked websites to those watching
[10:16] indutny: V1: was you able to open SPDY pages w/o --use-spdy mode?
[10:16] tmedema: that'd be cool.
[10:16] deebo: has anyone done a media streaming app that uses some native encoder to transcode/encode on the fly?
[10:16] deebo: like flac -> mp3/aac
[10:16] rubydiamond_: tmedema: thats immense
[10:17] tmedema: rubydiamond_: not that insanely difficult with node.js I reckon
[10:17] indutny: deebo: search at mailing list please, someone was streaming pink floyd few months ago
[10:17] deebo: hmm ill see
[10:18] V1: indutny: I have --use-spdy enabled by default in my env.

[10:29] V1: indutny: Yeh I just saw your messages to the spdy-dev list as well

[11:59] hackband: actually the option of interfacing with native code is really interesting
[11:59] johnnywengluu: node is the interface you want to deal with
[11:59] johnnywengluu: yeah
[12:00] johnnywengluu: or at least for you =)
[12:00] hackband: since it opens up pretty much all legacy drivers
[12:00] johnnywengluu: i think node is so sexy
[12:00] johnnywengluu: like looking at a beauty
[12:00] hackband: well it's not number one on the todo list but it's great to have that possibility
[12:00] JimBastard: i got #ror, #ruby, and #ruby-lang all on the line lol

[13:00] bradleymeck: lukegalea ive seen it, but i tend to enjoy coding in js more
[13:01] lukegalea: bradleymeck: hehe. Ya. I was thinking more along the lines of taking some serious C libraries like GNU Scientific Library and compiling it for inclusion in Node projects.
[13:02] bradleymeck: you can but perf will be a huge issue still, wont fix that :/

[13:03] lukegalea: bradleymeck: But I guess the question is: am I binding to C for speed? Or because I don't want to rewrite the library. if its' the latter, maybe emscripten is a good fit.
[13:03] bradleymeck: lukegalea math in js is much slower than other things (except string concats). it would be impressive to get 1/10th the speed of c doing any amount of math

[14:49] mrcaron: Ok, libev and libeio... can you tell me about those?

[14:50] mrcaron: I can understand not liking MS much, but for a windows native port, we should do things the MS way.  :)
[14:51] piscisaureus: ok. libev is an event loop. It abstracts select, poll, kqueue, epoll etc on linuxes
[14:51] mrcaron: got it... found the google :)
[14:51] piscisaureus: libeio is basically a thread pool so you can run blocking io in a thread. Most unixes do not support asynchronous file io so we use libeio for that
[14:52] mrcaron: ok, so is liboio an attempt to abstract libeio?
[14:52] piscisaureus: both libev and libeio
[14:52] piscisaureus: the thing is
[14:52] mrcaron: k
[14:52] piscisaureus: on linux you get 'readyness notifitations', e.g. the kernel tells you you can do a non-blocking write to a socket
[14:53] piscisaureus: windows doesn't work that way. You tell it to do something and it will ping you when it's doen
[14:53] sub_pop has joined the channel
[14:53] piscisaureus: (windows supports the first model too using select() but it scales very poorly)
[14:54] tbranyen: hey man windows is enterprise ready
[14:54] piscisaureus: as it turns out you can map the linux model to the windows model but not the other way araound
[14:54] tbranyen: it scales all the way
[14:54] markc has joined the channel
[14:55] mattrobenolt has joined the channel
[14:55] piscisaureus: mrcaron: so we are building liboio that on windows uses IO completion ports and on linux uses libeio and libev and maps those to a completion-notification api
[14:56] mrcaron: ok... so are you suggesting that I first help out with liboio? Or at least get familiar there?
[14:56] piscisaureus: mrcaron: the node-windows work is kinda blocked on liboio now. So I think that's really your only option
[14:56] |sWORDs|: Is inbound UDP (dgram) fixed on windows already?
[14:56] warz has left the channel
[14:57] piscisaureus: |sWORDs| -> bug report?
[14:57] |sWORDs|: Which was the reason I moved to linux for node.

[14:57] mrcaron: |sWORDs|: that's not really fixing the problem though ;)
[14:57] |sWORDs|: Talked to ryan about it, he said he was not suprised and would take a look.
[14:58] |sWORDs|: mrcaron: No, but it would be a good first step ;)
[14:58] mrcaron: piscisaureus: ok, I'll start by cloning liboio and familiarizing myself there. Is there a todo list? Any sort of tracking with that other than GH?
[14:59] piscisaureus: mrcaron: not really, just me and ryah have been working on it, we were discussing it on IRC mostly

[15:00] mrcaron: ok... how often r u on irc? I work a day job and I only get an hour or two here and there... I'm just motivated to help because I'm not a big fan of cygwin ;)
[15:00] piscisaureus: mrcaron: the next thing I thing that should be done is implement timers and an equivalent for ev_idle and ev_async in liboio
[15:00] |sWORDs|: Anyone here ever moved from sql to nosql? I actually put my javascript object in a bunch of sql tables and rebuild the object on startup (with a lot of nested call). Would nosql (mongo) be a better pick?
[15:01] piscisaureus: mrcaron: ok. I am on IRC a lot.
[15:01] wink_: |sWORDs|: if thats the only way you can structure your data, yes
[15:01] mrcaron: ok, sounds good. I'll hop on the chan as often as I can to coordinate and ask q's
[15:02] piscisaureus: mrcaron: familiarize yourself with the api first. It's not too big so far, there is going to be a lot more

[15:02] mrcaron: The liboio api, I assume?
[15:02] piscisaureus: mrcaron: If you really start hacking please coordinate
[15:02] piscisaureus: yeah
[15:02] mrcaron: ev_idle and ev_async I assume are part of libev
[15:03] |sWORDs|: wink_: There will be admin webpage to fill those "objects", and it will be used by the webservice, so it's not static.
[15:03] bradleymeck: sWORDs if you want a document store instead of tabular relational data, using a traditional nosql solution instead of nosql in sql (http://goo.gl/VCv0 http://goo.gl/FLS7A) would probably be a good idea

[15:03] piscisaureus: using a solution
[15:03] piscisaureus: so that should be easy :-)
[15:04] piscisaureus: I'm using MSVS 2010
[15:04] mrcaron: Nice. 2010 or 2008?
[15:04] mrcaron: ok.
[15:04] mrcaron: Me too. Should be pretty straight forward then.
[15:04] piscisaureus: mrcaron: what we at least need is api tests
[15:04] piscisaureus: mrcaron: because we need to validate that both implementations behave correctly / the same
[15:04] |sWORDs|: bradleymeck: What would be the upside of using nosql in sql versus mongodb?
[15:05] mrcaron: Ah, that should be a great place to start then... it'd help me get familiar

[15:05] mrcaron: I can at least use the MS test stuff to make some unit tests, not sure how I'd do that for the linux side.
[15:05] bradleymeck: or if you have a situation where you simply dont have a way to access nosql easily
[15:05] piscisaureus: yeah. You're lucky to be early. Files, timers, hooks , pipes are next up
[15:06] mrcaron: piscisaureus: are you working full time on this? 
[15:06] piscisaureus: ~ .5 fte
[15:07] mrcaron: ah, what's your other half?
[15:07] |sWORDs|: bradleymeck: The solution is just to easy to come up with myselve. They simply put the complete json object in a single field. That's pure genious.
[15:08] bradleymeck: |sWORDs| the indexes is where it gets funky, but thats just preprocessing / postprocessing by a worker job

[15:23] tmedema: bradleymeck: oh, so a prebuild application cannot be transformed into a cluster app by just changing the listen method as the intro implies

[15:24] bradleymeck: tmedema if it is truly async (ie. data can be accessed from multiple places at same time) you can just remove the server creation from your app (make it export the handler function) then cluster will take that function and handle the rest
[15:24] bradleymeck: so its like 3 line change generally if the data thing isnt a problem
[15:25] bradleymeck: (wont work on in-memory based dbs)
[15:25] tmedema: bradleymeck: that's what I mean, eg. if I use now.js each client will have a different set of clients in the everyone pool.
[15:25] tmedema: even though the everyone pool is supposed to contain.. well.. everyone

[15:27] tmedema: at the moment it looks like you indeed only need to change 3 lines :) got me confused
[15:27] tmedema: I figured it'd be using shared memory or something
[15:28] mattrobenolt: It would be nice to allocated shared memory down to the master process or something.

My app will first be build for a single instance, but I probably will have to take advantage of multiple cores later. Basically, I need to use an independent key-value storage like Redis where I would otherewise have used in-memory variables that need to be accessible to al
[15:33] bradleymeck: you got cut off by the char limit
[15:34] tmedema: Oh sorry
[15:34] tmedema: Basically, I need to use an independent key-value storage like Redis where I would otherewise have used in-memory variables that need to be accessible to all workers?
[15:34] themiddleman_itv: bradleymeck: yeah not really, it's not for a website, it's for an api and this uses a tiny image in a webpage for tracking  :)  its pretty sweet though
[15:34] |sWORDs|: torgeir: I'm not that far yet, sorry.

[17:15] pyrotechnick: you have keys too
[17:15] pyrotechnick: so i guess you already have redis covered by an ORM somewhat

[17:18] pyrotechnick: well you may be right in practise
[17:18] pyrotechnick: but in terms of github
[17:18] pyrotechnick: js was under ruby just 3 months ago
[17:18] pyrotechnick: maybe they changed how they count it
[17:18] mjr_: Do you have a source for that "most popular" thing?  I know Crockford says that a lot, but I've looked for data, and it looks like C is still way more used than JS.
[17:18] pyrotechnick: or maybe js has taken 2% ground
[17:19] pyrotechnick: i think crockford means it in terms of people who could probably write a simple app in it
[17:19] pyrotechnick: because script kiddies have all played with it
[17:19] pyrotechnick: it has had a massive exposure
[17:19] tbranyen: mjr_: cite: github :3

[17:20] pyrotechnick: i remember watching a lecture called the NBL

[17:51] baudehlo1: bingomanatee: https://github.com/baudehlo/Haraka/blob/master/plugins/data.uribl.js#L73

[17:52] ryanj has joined the channel
[17:53] cardona507 has joined the channel

[17:58] baudehlo1: honestly we haven't seen any used in email addresses in the wild yet that I know of.
[17:58] nail__: because they dont validate! 
[17:58] zed0: Isn't it easiest just ot let people put in whatever they want for email addresses and if it doesn't work then that's their lookout?

[18:35] malkomalko: yah figured as much, just didn't know if there was a good solution
[18:36] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: not at the moment, it would be awkward too currently since text can use interpolation so you would have to escape \#{}
[18:36] indutny: tjholowaychuk: hi! I want to use connect for my spdy server, but looks like it can work only w/ predefined 'http' and 'https' modules
[18:36] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: for "meta-jade" haha. hmm, maybe we need some kind of filter
[18:37] malkomalko: I think client side jade has much more value if you can put templates like that right in your view instead of inlining via code in js.. that becomes a hassle
[18:37] malkomalko: I think a filter would probably be perfect
[18:37] tjholowaychuk: I'll add an issue
[18:37] malkomalko: cool, I'll hack on it too
[18:39] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: https://github.com/visionmedia/jade/issues/202
[18:39] tjholowaychuk: the trailing "." already makes it text-only
[18:39] tjholowaychuk: so it does kinda work however there are some edge cases that wont
[18:41] malkomalko: solid.. I think some template naming filter so you can just reference your template by name inside your client side code would be pretty neat
[18:42] malkomalko: seems like that trailing . works well though.. even for each foo in foos
[18:43] tjholowaychuk: the indentation output is not currently the exact same as the input
[18:43] tjholowaychuk: which kinda sucks

[19:20] clee: how do I profile my nodejs code?
[19:20] indutny: carsonm: good are you using zlib lib?
[19:20] indutny: bradleymeck: not really full duplex, only response and headers of request, not body
[19:21] carsonm: indutny: yeah, but I had to hack the crap out of it
[19:21] indutny: carsonm: I'd patched zlib too, it's called zlibcontext. So I can control Stream Resetion and dictionary
[19:21] indutny: carsonm: what'd you patched to get NPN working in node.js?
[19:22] carsonm: indutny: I used SVN OpenSSL and then added the NPN callback stuff to the crypto source.
[19:22] indutny: carsonm: haha :D I really done same work. Why you hadn't published it?
[19:23] carsonm: indutny: I did but via twitter... :)

[19:23] M3l7D0wN has joined the channel
[19:23] carsonm: indutny: I was going to patch each part before pushing it all out and it really isn't that useful without npn support in node's tls module.

[19:24] indutny: carsonm: yep
[19:24] cbiscardi: marshal: doing anything interesting with them?
[19:25] indutny: carsonm: you have many function callers in your spdy proxy, is it fast to do that?
[19:25] marshall: according to express' docs, by default when rendering a jade template, it will pass the template you give it as the variable `body` to layout.jade. This seems to be happening for me, but the rendered template text is being escaped and not displaying as html elements on the page. Anybody encounter this before?
[19:25] marshall: cbiscardi: yeah, it's pretty neat. I'll show you once I get it working

[19:46] ryah: does anyone know how to get shutdown(2) to return a ENOTCONN?
[19:46] ryah: seems really difficult..
[19:46] carsonm: indutny: are you going to ask for that change to be pulled?
[19:46] ryah: i'd think if the connection got a reset packet you'd get ENOTCNN
[19:46] indutny: carsonm: when all work will be done
[19:47] indutny: ryah: btw what do you think about NPN in node.js TLS module?
[19:47] ryah: indutny: i looked at it briefly - i'm excited about it
[19:47] V1: Released: new plugin for cluster, aka cluster.exception: https://github.com/3rd-eden/cluster.exception ^_^
[19:47] cbiscardi: tjholowaychuk: so is res.send better than res.write when using express?
[19:47] ryah: indutny: im trying to catch up - so it may take me a little bit to get to it
[19:47] indutny: ryah: do you mean my implementation or npn generally?
[19:48] sonolin: .... weird now all the sudden it doesn't error on me any more
[19:48] ryah: npn generally
[19:48] sonolin: also doesn't hang up the call though, I guess I'll play around with it some more
[19:48] tjholowaychuk: cbiscardi: well not better, just different, completely different
[19:48] marshall: I'm trying to move a slugify function into an external requirement file called utils.js, how exactly should I write a basic utility file that can be included in node scripts?
[19:48] tjholowaychuk: V1: sweet :)
[19:49] carsonm: indutny: The big issue is that npn isn't in a released version of openssl yet.
[19:49] indutny: ryah: please take a look at mine: http://github.com/donnerjack13589/node/tree/openssl-npn
[19:50] indutny: carsonm: yep, that's problem. so if we want it in node.js we'll need to add it to the deps dir

[19:50] indutny: carsonm: using connect's static router
[19:51] tjholowaychuk: V1: yeah totally, cluster-mail is tiny. I've just been trying to seperate concerns into separate plugins
[19:51] tjholowaychuk: mail / log / etc
[19:51] tjholowaychuk: V1: looks like a good alternative though, great for debugging with all that info
[19:52] V1: tjholowaychuk: That was the reasoning behind it.. Now that I got this covered, I will most likely use the `history` module that I created to build a cluster-metrics module :)

[19:53] tjholowaychuk: just gotta finish it up a bit
[19:53] cbiscardi: sonolin: res.send ends the response(res.end), you'll have to use res.write because you're writing multiple times. The connection is closed after your first res.send which is why you get the error when you try to write the second time (res.send trys to write headers after the connection is closed)

[20:28] PhilK: npm - 1.0.1rc7
[20:28] isaacs: PhilK: in the latest 1.0 rc (or maybe not yet released?) there's an option to always send auth
[20:28] piscisaureus`c: Also, there is this problem: you don't want to naively reuse the oio_req
[20:28] isaacs: PhilK: see if it works with HEAD
[20:29] isaacs: carnivore: a more aggressive dino name?

[20:30] piscisaureus`c: yes me too. So oio_interval(oio_req *req, double interval) is not a good idea because the req will be sent to a callback multiple times
[20:30] mjr_: I don't yet get convore.  Is the idea that twitter doesn't have conversations, so you want to have web-based conversations with people you don't want to be facebook friends with?
[20:31] PhilK: isaacs: just git pulled and installed and still getting it (already had always-auth set)
[20:32] PhilK: isaacs: am I just being stupid by trying it as --registry  "https://user:pass@myregistry.com"?
[20:32] isaacs: PhilK: ahhh, ok
[20:32] isaacs: PhilK: so, the registry will send your user/pass that you create with `npm adduser`
[20:32] isaacs: you could set it up as a proxy server, and then have a proxy config AND a registry config
[20:33] isaacs: but the --registry should be just a url only
[20:33] PhilK: ah, so I have to have the user/pass coming from cloudkick, not an htpasswd file with apache?
[20:33] PhilK: hah, from couchdb
[20:33] isaacs: ha, i thought you might've been a cloud-kicker ;)
[20:34] PhilK: yup, one of the new guys :)
[20:34] isaacs: PhilK: the user/pass that you create with npm adduser is what goes into the couchdb, yes
[20:34] isaacs: you can maybe configure apache to use that as its auth store or something, or you can make http proxy requests through apache using a user/pass in a htpasswd file.

[20:36] gilesgoatboy has joined the channel
[20:36] PhilK: ah, so I can use the htpasswd? the 401 I'm receiving is coming back from apache, not couch. it's more like npm isn't passing the http basic auth credentials over so it's never getting into couch
[20:36] ryah`c: i suspect there is some optimization that can be done when you know that the timer will fire again
[20:37] piscisaureus: isaacs: ^
[20:37] isaacs: piscisaureus: i see it :)
[20:37] isaacs: PhilK: so, there are two things that npm sends auth to.
[20:37] danbeam: assuming you guys have seen this, but, ... http://soundcloud.com/marak/marak-the-node-js-rap
[20:37] danbeam: if you haven't
[20:37] piscisaureus: isaacs: yeah I wasn't sure if your irc client would be smart about ï == i
[20:37] isaacs: 1. the registry - this is from the "_auth" config param that you create using npm adduser.  It's a couchdb thing.

[20:39] isaacs: PhilK: so, you could set up an apache server that is a transparent wrapper around the registry, and uses couchdb as its auth store, or you could set up apache as a proxy server, and have it proxy to a (perhaps not exposed) couchdb server, and everyone does `npm config set proxy http://user:pass@server:8080" or something
[20:39] mythril has joined the channel
[20:39] isaacs: and then you could even do: registry = http://localhost:5984/registry/_design/app/_rewrites

[20:40] piscisaureus`c: I don't know, I don't think libev optimizes it. The pain with timers is in keeping your list with timeouts sorted. I don't think that is going away when you have a repeating timer.
[20:40] isaacs: or you could set it up with a rewrite like i do, and have something like http://registry.cloudkick.local/ or something
[20:41] ryah`c: i think the cancel should be general to all oio_req
[20:41] ryah`c: oio_cancel()
[20:41] PhilK: isaacs: ahh, setting the proxy sounds like it'll fix it, thanks. I'll come back and bug you if I'm still stumped
[20:41] McMAGIC--Copy has joined the channel
[20:41] isaacs: okie dokie
[20:42] isaacs: PhilK: "always send auth" will always send your *registry* auth info, not necessarily the proxy
[20:42] piscisaureus`c: allright
[20:42] isaacs: the proxy auth is always sent if the proxy url has auth on it
[20:42] piscisaureus`c: but how do you free a timer?
[20:42] piscisaureus`c: you need something like close and close_cb
[20:42] piscisaureus`c: oh, right.hm
[20:42] Gelegrodan: its not possible for multiple clients to share one child process in some way? if i for example wanna do like this but i dont want X vnstat -l running: https://gist.github.com/914287
[20:42] isaacs: piscisaureus: looks like the convore util isn't waiting any time between /nick and message
[20:43] isaacs: piscisaureus: i'm seeing it post as "carnivore" rather than "piscisaureus`c"
[20:43] ryah`c: if the timer isnt in progress then i think the handle can be released
[20:43] isaacs: piscisaureus: probably ought to wait a bit of time for the message to send before /nick-ing back
[20:44] ohtogo has joined the channel
[20:45] piscisaureus`c: maybe we should not have a oio_timer handle

[20:45] piscisaureus`c: just send oio_timeout straight
[20:45] piscisaureus: isaacs: hmm are nicks propagated slowly?
[20:46] piscisaureus: like do race conditions between /nick and messages exist?
[20:46] isaacs: piscisaureus: well, they're both just messages, afaik.

[22:08] tjholowaychuk: sako: you can always set the delimiter options of ejs to make it look more like mustache
[22:08] tjholowaychuk: or use mustache
[22:08] tjholowaychuk: instead of handlebars
[22:08] Tidwell: sako: yea, after looking at jade, and doing loads of custom html/css/js, it just seems overly complicated - html is easy enough that I want it to have as much control as possible over the markup

[22:10] corey_: tidwell: i am trying to set up for using a kinect and i am at the step where i have to type ./configure

[22:11] tjholowaychuk: Tidwell: totally, that's a valid reason

[22:23] tjholowaychuk: sako: I was a ruby guy for quite a while
[22:23] Leonidas: tjholowaychuk: yeah, I saw them. Also saw a dust-plugin on the npm registry
[22:23] sako: Leonidas: that's why i was trying to make handlebars work with express :)
[22:23] Nexxy: ooh tjholowaychuk ty ;3 
[22:24] corey_: Tidwell: it tells me to run dash, or ash. Both exist, does it matter which one I use?
[22:24] tjholowaychuk: Leonidas: yeah, I have plans to support similar, just tough to find features that will work with all engines as-is
[22:24] tjholowaychuk: since I dont want to lock express to a specific template engine like django does
[22:24] tjholowaychuk: but I do want some of those features
[22:24] tjholowaychuk: blocks mostly
[22:24] Leonidas: tjholowaychuk: yeah, definitely a sensible thing.
[22:24] astropirate has joined the channel
[22:25] tjholowaychuk: other than that the django one looks a lottttttt like liquid
[22:25] carnivore: 14topic: Liboio design (http://convore.com/nodejs-7/liboio-design/)
[22:25] ryah`c: okay, i like it
[22:25] Tidwell: corey_: I don't believe so, but if one doesn't work, I'd just restart the steps and try the other :P lol
[22:25] Leonidas: But I saw quite a bit interesting techniques in the template systems that are linked in the node wiki page
[22:25] ryah`c: another 64 bits per req, but - okay
[22:25] sako: templating is one of the hardest parts of a damn framework :P
[22:26] corey_: Tidwell: sounds good. just wanted to make sure i didnt mess up any settings or anything
[22:26] tjholowaychuk: Leonidas: yeah that's the problem, soooooo many options
[22:26] tjholowaychuk: I'd hate to restrict the choice
[22:26] tjholowaychuk: sako: nah it's just a very opinionated portion
[22:26] piscisaureus`c: it's debatable :-)
[22:26] sako: tjholowaychuk: +1 for liquid lol
[22:26] piscisaureus`c: I think cancelling reads and writes is actually a bad idea.
[22:26] tjholowaychuk: sako: I've thought about writing liquid for node
[22:26] sako: tjholowaychuk: can i help with that? i would love to get the ball rolling 
[22:26] Leonidas: dust is a bit like django templates on speed, and jade looks like haml (and I have no clue how to write code for haml) and there are nice selector based engines that look tedious and there is weld.
[22:27] piscisaureus`c: It is hard to get conceptually right and people are not going to cancel a read/write unless they want to close the file or socket. Then they should just do that.
[22:27] Tyrkul has joined the channel
[22:27] Tidwell: tjholowaychuk: I love the fact that with express I can rip out and use whatever engine I want, especially because I often have some *weird* choices in templating :P
[22:27] sako: tjholowaychuk: i will start looking through express code get a feel for what i would need to do.. any suggestions on where to look?
[22:27] Leonidas: to be honest, I think Jinja2 is way better than django… and possibly liquid, no idea about that
[22:28] tjholowaychuk: sako: no need, all you need to support express is to export .compile(str) => Function
[22:28] tjholowaychuk: sako: and that function is called with an object containing the locals
[22:28] Leonidas: tjholowaychuk: what influenced the choice of the templates that Express supports out of the box?
[22:28] piscisaureus`c: If that 64 bits per req is a problem, then we could reintroduce the `err` parameter (maybe just call it `cancelled`?) that gets passed to eio_whatever_cb
[22:28] tjholowaychuk: Leonidas: technically nothing works out of the box, people just support express through their module
[22:29] sako: interesting
[22:29] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: any plans to make the templating engine optionally accept a callback in the future?
[22:29] Leonidas: tjholowaychuk: ah, I see. Good that there is a semi-standard
[22:29] muk_mb has joined the channel
[22:29] tjholowaychuk: chrisdickinson: yup there is an issue for that
[22:29] chrisdickinson: awesome
[22:30] ryah`c: yeah - maybe just a flags
[22:30] ryah`c: like in libev - revents
[22:30] chrisdickinson: I've been hoping to make my template language express-compatible, but since it's callback-based it's been... difficult :\

[22:49] sspencercon: yes
[22:49] isaacs: welcome to the party, man :)
[22:49] cloudhead: hey isaacs, is node going to have `/usr/local/lib/node_modules` in the path soon, or how does that work? cause non of the modules are found by default with npm 1.0, unless I add that path.
[22:49] heythisisdave has joined the channel
[22:49] cloudhead: none*
[22:49] sspencercon: no longer at yahoo ... working on big node.js installation, servicing billions of request per day :)
[22:49] isaacs: cloudhead: no.  if you want to require() stuff then install it locally
[22:50] isaacs: sspencercon: right on.  congrats on graduating from yu
[22:50] isaacs: Y.U.
[22:50] isaacs: cloudhead: or add that path to the NODE_PATH environ
[22:50] isaacs: but really local installs.  that's where it's at.
[22:50] cloudhead: isaacs: is there a way to do that when people install from npm though?
[22:51] cloudhead: how does that make sense?
[22:51] isaacs: cloudhead: if you want to require() it, then install it locally.
[22:51] isaacs: cloudhead: if you want to $run it, then install it globally
[22:51] cloudhead: so I have to bundle all dependencies in my git repo?
[22:51] cloudhead: for every package?
[22:51] isaacs: cloudhead: no, you can git ignore them if you want.
[22:51] isaacs: cloudhead: and npm will be smart about only including the ones you tell it to when you publish
[22:52] cloudhead: hmm
[22:52] gtramont1na has joined the channel
[22:52] isaacs: "bundledDependencies": ["these", "deps", "will", "be", "bundled"]
[22:52] cloudhead: can I link instead of bundling?
[22:52] isaacs: cloudhead: sure,  `npm help link` will tell you what to do :)
[22:52] cloudhead: ok
[22:53] sveisvei has joined the channel
[22:54] cloudhead: isaacs: so bundledDependencies will auto-bundle when I publish?
[22:54] cloudhead: or do I still do that manually
[22:55] cloudhead: and is "dependencies" still useful?
[22:55] zkirill_ has joined the channel
[22:55] isaacs: cloudhead: you should install all your deps in your project, and list them in "dependencies", yes
[22:55] isaacs: cloudhead: link/install whatever
[22:55] dachary has joined the channel
[22:55] isaacs: cloudhead: "bundledDependencies" is a list of dependency names that should be packaged with your lib, rather than fetched separately.
[22:56] isaacs: note: even if they're not installed globally, you'll still be able to access the "bin" files from your deps in npm scripts.
[22:56] isaacs: so, { "scripts": { "test" : "vows foo.js", "preinstall" : "cake *.coffee" } } <-- that will still work
[22:56] isaacs: as long as coffee-script and vows are listed as dependencies.
[22:56] cloudhead: gotcha
[22:56] isaacs: you should not have to do crazy mumbo jumbo in the scripts.  if you find yourself doing any complex bashery, lmk
[22:57] dachary: Hi, what package would you recommend I use to implement long polling for a webservice (carrying JSON) ? 
[22:57] sspencercon has left the channel
[22:57] isaacs: because either your'e doing it wrong, or i am
[22:57] cloudhead: but I still don't quite get bundledDeps, does it actually do anything, or does it just specify?
[22:57] cloudhead: hehe
[22:57] isaacs: cloudhead: it tells npm to not pass over that folder in the publish process, when it creates the tarball
[22:57] isaacs: otherwise it'll see ./node_modules/foo and go "Oh, well, foo's a dependency, that'll get installed later, don't need that"
[22:58] cloudhead: so the dependencies are fetched later?
[22:59] tjholowaychuk: cloudhead: yes, just like they are now
[22:59] tjholowaychuk: npm still resolves them for you
[22:59] isaacs: yes ^
[22:59] isaacs: tjholowaychuk++
[22:59] v8bot:  isaacs has given a beer to tjholowaychuk. tjholowaychuk now has 22 beers.
[22:59] tjholowaychuk: just in a slick hierarchy of node_modules dirs
[22:59] cloudhead: isaacs: so what is the purpose of bundling, if it fetches the deps anyway?
[23:00] cloudhead: I'm missing something
[23:01] flippyhead has joined the channel
[23:01] KRTac has joined the channel
[23:02] KRTac: mornin'
[23:02] isaacs: cloudhead: that's why the bundle command went away in 1.0 :)
[23:02] isaacs: cloudhead: the purpose of installing deps locally is to use them whiel you develop
[23:02] cloudhead: isaacs: oh!
[23:02] cloudhead: ok that makes more sense
[23:03] cloudhead: so when you `npm install`, it'll still fetch all the deps and take care of that, depending on what's in "dependencies"
[23:03] isaacs: yeah
[23:03] isaacs: :)
[23:03] isaacs: like how `npm bundle` without any args used to work
[23:03] cloudhead: ok yea
[23:03] isaacs: npm install foo; require("foo")
[23:04] isaacs: npm install; require("all my deps")
[23:04] ryah: perezd: is that fixing that issue?
[23:04] ryah: perezd: i wish i had your laptop again

[23:04] ryah: where are you?
[23:04] perezd: Skype or something?
[23:04] perezd: Palo Alto
[23:05] cloudhead: isaacs: gotit, so bundledDependencies is only useful if you specifically want to bundle a dependency, vs let npm do it itself
[23:05] ryah: perezd: i'll go home and get on my mac
[23:05] isaacs: cloudhead: yes, exactly
[23:05] cloudhead: \o/
[23:05] ryah: then we can ichat?
[23:05] perezd: sure!
[23:05] ryah: perezd: will you be around in an hour?
[23:05] cloudhead: ok
[23:05] isaacs: cloudhead: that feature is mostly there so that npm can install itslef.
[23:05] cloudhead: isaacs++
[23:05] perezd: ryah: yes indeed!
[23:05] v8bot:  cloudhead has given a beer to isaacs. isaacs now has 15 beers.
[23:05] ryah: okay
[23:05] cloudhead: ok
[23:05] isaacs: cloudhead: since it can't rely on being able to fetch its dependencies at bootstrap time
[23:05] cloudhead: yea
[23:06] isaacs: cloudhead: it's also useful if, say, you install connect, make some patches, and wnat to use your changed version

[23:59] bingomanatee: tjholowaychuk: yeah; if you want to do reflection you are better off with manual property hints.

[23:59] CIA-72: node: Update how REPLServer uses contexts
[23:59] CIA-72: node: * Always use `this.context` or `self.context`.
[23:59] CIA-72: node: * Move `resetContext` to `REPLServer.createContext`.
[23:59] CIA-72: node: * Add `REPLServer.resetContext`, memoize `context` here.
[23:59] CIA-72: node: * Memoize `exports.repl` in `start`.
[23:59] CIA-72: node: Closes GH-851. - http://bit.ly/dJb6Dl
[23:59] Zurich: assumed it said Node :)
