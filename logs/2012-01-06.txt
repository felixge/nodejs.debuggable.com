[00:02] isaacs: oh, i should also check the checksum.
[00:02] isaacs: derp.

[00:05] isaacs: Narmical: 0.6.5.  but it didn't work until 0.6.6
[00:05] isaacs: er, no, 0.6.3
[00:05] isaacs: one of those
[00:05] mmalecki: 0.6.3
[00:05] mmalecki: it was fun as fuck
[00:05] isaacs: i think 0.6.4 or 5 was the first one where it worked.
[00:05] pquerna: `3rdEden: but man, thats the whole point of bootstrap, i suck at design, with bootstrap it looks 'good enough', and i spend time writing features not messing with colors ;)
[00:06] Narmical: ok cool thanks, 
[00:07] Narmical: i have a system with an older verson of node.js is there anything special i need to do to upgrade other than get the new source and recompile?
[00:07] bnoordhuis: Narmical: how old is older?
[00:07] `3rdEden: pquerna sure, but now that nearly every single developer started using it, it's not `good enough` anymore.. It just gets annoying to see the same layout / design over and over again
[00:07] Narmical: hmm let me check
[00:09] `3rdEden: pquerna and from a users point a of view, really confusion as well, as your have 10 sites, with the same layout/design doing different things. I don't have anything against boot strap, it's a well designed framework, but people should atleast make the layout theirs by chaning the header colors, link colors or what ever.

[01:12] ryanolds_w: Been having an ongoing discussion with a co-worker about adding pubsub to our system. Right now we have nothing that requires any sort of multi listener messaging. Can't tell if I'm being unreasonable when I block the adding the pubsub infrastructure.
[01:12] tjholowaychuk: yeah start with node first for sure then you'll see what the frameworks offer
[01:12] jesusabdullah: or, just use parts of express. It's not too bad to throw down some middleware and some templates
[01:12] jerrysv: usually the biggest hump has been sync vs async
[01:12] EyePulp: markq: We've sort of made the decision not to use node for web apps with lots of html & standard browser-based interfaces.  We tend to use it more for web based services that other apps digest.  That way we keep our web stack & knowledge and just add node goodies as needed.

[02:03] BillyBreen has joined the channel
[02:03] chrisdickinson: Sorella: the way i've come to terms with it is as follows: constructor functions should only perform member initialization, similar to C's struct assignment.
[02:03] SubStack: I really don't see how javascript's prototype OO needs fixing
[02:03] SubStack: you should only use it sparingly anyways
[02:03] Sorella: SubStack, it could get multiple delegation. That'd rock.
[02:03] tbranyen: SubStack: setting an existing objects prototype needs fixin
[02:04] tbranyen: esp. if i'm gonna get bitched at for using __proto__
[02:04] tjholowaychuk: traitsss
[02:04] jocafa: i just want fast getters and setters implemented everywhere
[02:04] tbranyen: i just want my kids back
[02:04] Sorella: And multiple dispatching on prototypes.
[02:04] SubStack: tbranyen: mixins then? seems like you could bless that in Object.mixin without rewriting the syntax rules
[02:04] else- has joined the channel
[02:05] tbranyen: SubStack: mixins copy properties between objects, i don't wanna touch those, i want to set the prototype

[02:05] tjholowaychuk: i wouldnt complain if all we had was mixins
[02:05] kitt has joined the channel
[02:05] chrisdickinson: we could just go all the way to the python side and copy the MRO tuple.
[02:06] Sorella: But it would be awesome if you could do: var foo = {}; foo.addDelegation(Array.prototype); foo.addDelegation(LazyStream.prototype); /* foo now falls back to both LazyStream and Array */
[02:06] chrisdickinson: so the mixin case would just be making an object with multiple __proto__ parents, walked in a sawtooth fashion.
[02:06] Swizec has joined the channel
[02:07] Sorella: Not sure how it'd work with the diamond problem though. I mean, you don't have initialisation with delegation.
[02:07] chrisdickinson: Sorella: so, foo = Object.instantiate({}, [Array.prototype, LazyStream.prototype])
[02:07] chrisdickinson: Sorella: python's model would work.
[02:07] Sorella: chrisdickinson, where `instantiate' would be?
[02:07] jonbaer_ has joined the channel
[02:07] tjholowaychuk: the Array/LazyStream functions could be the protos as well
[02:08] tjholowaychuk: [Array, LazyStream]
[02:08] Sorella: chrisdickinson, no, Python's model doesn't allow me to add and remove prototypes after the object's creation.
[02:08] chrisdickinson: Sorella: it does, pythonistas will just get mad at you if you do.
[02:08] jocafa: I SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO DEBUG WHITESPACE </pythonrage>
[02:08] Sorella: I haven't got to that part in Python, then.
[02:09] Sorella: The change would be just that instead of having a single prototype, you'd have a list of them, and probably some MRO to account for the diamond problem =/
[02:09] willwhite has joined the channel
[02:10] chrisdickinson: yep, given an attribute lookup, hit each proto in order of the list. then, if it's not found, start at the front of the list and walk up one prototype.

[02:20] tjholowaychuk: that's when
[02:20] tjholowaychuk: you compile a language to js
[02:20] tjholowaychuk: extra layers
[02:21] SubStack: isaacs: that ordering bug in t.deepEqual in tap is quite annoying >_<
[02:21] SubStack:       FOUND:  {"a":5,"b":105}

[02:21] innociv has joined the channel
[02:21] SubStack: grumble
[02:21] isaacs: SubStack: yeah
[02:21] isaacs: wanna fix it?
[02:21] SubStack: ok
[02:22] Sorella: tjholowaychuk, well, implementing Lisp on top of JS sounds like a nice idea to me.
[02:22] isaacs: actually, the diffing stuff in there in general is pretty ghetto
[02:22] isaacs: SubStack: but not as ghetto as the stack capturing!!
[02:22] SubStack: I'll write a failing test first
[02:22] isaacs: you'll laugh if you look at tap/lib/tap-assert.js
[02:22] torvalamo: never seen ghetto used as an adjective before, and certainly not in a programming context
[02:22] innociv_ has joined the channel
[02:22] RLa: anyone want to implement prolog in js?
[02:22] EyePulp: heh
[02:22] isaacs: EyePulp: we live in oakland.
[02:22] isaacs: ghetto is just part of it.
[02:23] EyePulp: ACTION is trying to make "clown shoes" the new adjective of choice for something that's all sorts of ghetto.
[02:23] torvalamo: why would anyone want to do anything with prolog other than in prolog?
[02:23] Sorella: RLa, prolog isn't even useful =/
[02:23] torvalamo: :P
[02:23] isaacs: vows is kind of clown shoes.
[02:23] SubStack: isaacs: aha I see how I could do it
[02:23] isaacs: in the sense that it's clumsy and colorful.
[02:23] RLa: aww
[02:23] EyePulp: see?  It's fun.
[02:23] isaacs: and i have trouble walking in it
[02:24] SubStack: isaacs: it looks like sorting the keys in stringify() might work
[02:24] isaacs: SubStack: great!
[02:24] innociv__ has joined the channel
[02:24] SubStack: I know because I've written this code before
[02:24] EyePulp: is there a more verbose analog to console.log(some_object)  to get more details about an object?
[02:24] redir_ has joined the channel
[02:24] isaacs: Object.keys(obj).sort( … ).reduce(function (o, k) { o[k] = obj[k]; return o }, {})
[02:24] isaacs: something like that?
[02:25] jocafa: console.dir
[02:25] SubStack: probably
[02:25] isaacs: EyePulp: check out the sys.inspect function
[02:25] agnat_ has joined the channel
[02:25] isaacs: EyePulp: it's got some good options.
[02:25] isaacs: color, even!
[02:25] SubStack: isaacs: it would have to be recursive though
[02:25] isaacs: SubStack: oh, right
[02:25] EyePulp: cool - danke
[02:25] SubStack: what about ripping the deepEquals out of assert?
[02:25] SubStack: that's what I did for testling
[02:26] isaacs: SubStack: that'd probably be fine
[02:26] jocafa: use node inspector?
[02:26] isaacs: SubStack: i really like the diffing, though
[02:26] SubStack: yeah that is handy
[02:26] colinclark has joined the channel
[02:26] SubStack: I can write a recursive sorter
[02:26] SubStack: that seems like the most minimal change that will fix it
[02:27] isaacs: SubStack: but it'd be fine maybe to not have a diff, and instead do something like "differs at x.y.z\nFOUND:  'asdfadsf'\nWANTED:  'fdsafdsa'"
[02:27] isaacs: i dunno
[02:27] innociv__ has joined the channel
[02:27] isaacs: i'm very open to even significant changes there, as long as it's functionally equivalent in terms of the info you get from it
[02:27] RLa: btw, is assert module supposed to be used only in unit tests?
[02:27] isaacs: RLa: you can use it however you want.
[02:27] isaacs: RLa: it's just if (!ok) throw ...
[02:28] materialdesigner has joined the channel
[02:28] isaacs: g'nite
[02:28] RLa: yeah, thought about using it in actual code, not just in tests
[02:28] tjholowaychuk: RLa https://github.com/visionmedia/better-assert
[02:28] SubStack: pow I have a failing test now
[02:28] tjholowaychuk: didnt know what to call it
[02:28] tjholowaychuk: hahaha
[02:29] EyePulp: bet-ass
[02:29] tjholowaychuk: i have a similar patch for node core
[02:29] jocafa: assert-damnit
[02:29] tjholowaychuk: minus the output
[02:29] RLa: very nice
[02:30] wingie: tjholowaychuk: could superagent npm package be updated to the latest so the basic auth support is included?
[02:30] tjholowaychuk: yeah sure one sec

[02:33] tjholowaychuk: wingie 0.2.0
[02:33] tjholowaychuk: might wanna peek at the changelog
[02:33] tjholowaychuk: only one api thing though
[02:34] EyePulp: using the built-in cluster module under 0.6.6, is there a method to capture errors that the master process is seeing within a worker and handle them? (I'm wanting to log the errors and send out an e-mail).  This might not really be a cluster specific issue, I guess - I just want to get some control over errors that currently get written to the console.
[02:34] chrisdickinson: Sorella: re: the mro-ery: https://gist.github.com/1568657
[02:35] EyePulp: I know I can respond to a worker's death, but how do I access the error object?
[02:35] wingie: tjholowaychuk: wiii worked great
[02:35] EyePulp: or is there an error object in play?
[02:35] chrisdickinson: lil' broken on second look.
[02:35] secoif has joined the channel
[02:35] wingie: damn why did isaacs leave
[02:36] wingie: could one say that it's safe to specify versions like this "1.x.x" instead of "1.2.x" since all minor versions shouldn't break your code?
[02:36] mike5w3c_ has joined the channel
[02:37] wingie: so you don't have to look up all minor versions change all the time
[02:37] tjholowaychuk: youcould do just 1.x
[02:37] tjholowaychuk: etc
[02:37] wingie: yeah
[02:37] secoif has joined the channel
[02:37] tjholowaychuk: but for stuff like superagent that is still changing you probably dont want that
[02:37] tjholowaychuk: haha
[02:37] wingie: so it's safe just to care about the major version?
[02:37] wingie: tjholowaychuk: but they shouldn't break if its a minor version update
[02:37] wingie: that is against the semver convention!
[02:38] tjholowaychuk: < 1.0
[02:38] innociv_ has joined the channel
[02:38] secoif has joined the channel
[02:38] tjholowaychuk: you do whatever
[02:38] wingie: oh right
[02:38] wingie: haha
[02:38] wingie: hm i have to read it again
[02:38] secoif has joined the channel
[02:38] tjholowaychuk: people dont follow it anyway so you're kinda screwed
[02:39] wingie: but then i could just point them to it
[02:39] wingie: and they will correct
[02:39] wingie: or i will stop using their lib
[02:39] wingie: since they cannot maintain it correctly
[02:39] tjholowaychuk: i almost think if you have features AND bugfixes in a release it should be a minor and patch-level bump
[02:39] tjholowaychuk: just so you can tell at a glance
[02:39] tjholowaychuk: but meh changelogs are what's important
[02:39] wingie: hmm
[02:39] tazrover has left the channel
[02:40] tjholowaychuk: it would be awesome to do $ npm changelog
[02:40] tjholowaychuk: magically
[02:40] tjholowaychuk: somehow
[02:40] tjholowaychuk: some day
[02:40] wingie: yeah that would be nice .. actually when you install it
[02:41] mdel has joined the channel
[02:41] tjholowaychuk: sometimes you get crucial fixes to some module
[02:41] tjholowaychuk: and you have no clue
[02:41] wingie: npm could check your current npm module versions and then print out change logs for those packages that are updated
[02:41] tjholowaychuk: which is why i liek doing 1.x etc
[02:41] tjholowaychuk: but it also breaks sometimes
[02:41] wingie: i think gem is working like that
[02:41] wingie: recall i see some "what is new" when i installed a gem
[02:42] c4milo has joined the channel
[02:42] tjholowaychuk: changelogs should be json or something ideally
[02:43] wingie: "Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable."
[02:43] wingie: does that imply that minor versions could break backwards comapatibility?
[02:43] torm3nt has joined the channel
[02:43] tjholowaychuk: when it's below 1.0
[02:43] tjholowaychuk: eyah
[02:43] tjholowaychuk: yeah*
[02:43] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: why not just pull changelog data out of the commit logs?
[02:43] tjholowaychuk: chrisdickinson i do
[02:43] tjholowaychuk: git-changelog
[02:44] tjholowaychuk: does it for me
[02:44] tjholowaychuk: as markdown
[02:44] chrisdickinson: no, i mean for npm changelog.
[02:44] tjholowaychuk: but still, it would be cool if an entire community normalized this stuff
[02:44] tjholowaychuk: oh
[02:44] tjholowaychuk: too much to look at
[02:44] wingie: chrisdickinson: good solution .. no need for manually write things
[02:44] wingie: even better
[02:44] tjholowaychuk: usually maybe ~10% of those are changelog worthy
[02:44] wingie: so everyone is writing good descriptive commit comments 
[02:44] jldbasa has joined the channel
[02:45] chrisdickinson: so, npm install . --changelog would do a dry run of updating, and show you a project-delimited list of changes.
[02:45] chrisdickinson: (using git shortlog, maybe.)
[02:45] euoia has joined the channel
[02:45] wingie: perhaps you could introduce a prefix that will be pulled out of the log to create the change log
[02:45] tbranyen: i wish i could read the npm init source code
[02:45] tbranyen: this is sooo confuzzling
[02:45] wingie: git commit -m "changelog: add feature X"
[02:45] sorensen: heyo, anyone have any ideas on how to hook into a mongoose pre-read/fetch method?
[02:46] SubStack: pow https://github.com/isaacs/node-tap/pull/35
[02:46] chrisdickinson: wingie: or look at when the package.json changed, and give a list of hashes between the changes?
[02:46] squidly_ has joined the channel
[02:46] chjj: is the "tags" field in package.json undocumented?
[02:46] tjholowaychuk: wingie yeah some kind of flag would work
[02:46] tjholowaychuk: in the commit message
[02:46] Stephen has joined the channel
[02:46] wingie: tjholowaychuk: that would be cool .. so they won't read the "remove whitespace" commits
[02:46] tjholowaychuk: anything with a Closes #
[02:47] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: in practice, when running "npm install" to update your deps, are many of your deps changing minor versions?
[02:47] Stephen: Ok, I have a general development question, maybe some smarts here can help
[02:47] tjholowaychuk: we have ours all pegged
[02:48] chrisdickinson: hm. i just wonder how much of a problem it would be in practice to get a bunch of short commit messages in the changelog.
[02:48] Stephen: My app tracks "locations"
[02:48] LukeBrookhart has joined the channel
[02:48] chrisdickinson: for the one or two projects whose versions actually get bumped.
[02:48] Stephen: ... better yet, URLs
[02:48] tjholowaychuk: so much noise though
[02:48] tjholowaychuk: unless people branch and --squash
[02:48] tjholowaychuk: for features
[02:48] Stephen: But it does so anonymously my hashing the URL before sending to the server
[02:48] tjholowaychuk: you get a ton of noise
[02:48] wingie: only tjholowaychuk's packages in my package.json is < 0 haha
[02:48] wingie: unstable!
[02:49] Stephen: In the past I have designed the app to disregard secure urls (https)
[02:49] wingie: socket.io, commander, superagent
[02:49] tjholowaychuk: that's why it's < 1
[02:49] tjholowaychuk: haha
[02:49] tjholowaychuk: so i can change it
[02:49] tjholowaychuk: because it's not even half done
[02:49] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: you'd get all the data, and then you could just grep for the data you'd like to see.
[02:49] tjholowaychuk: well a little more than half
[02:49] Stephen: Because usernames are attached to these hashes, and https is supposed to remain secure
[02:49] Stephen: Now, each hash can have objects attached to it
[02:49] innociv__ has joined the channel
[02:50] chrisdickinson: and ideally, you could also do a npm update --test that would run `npm test` on your repo after updating, and if it breaks, determine the dep update that broke your package.
[02:50] Stephen: Like a trap
[02:50] LukeBrookhart: @tjholowaychuk, I just started using a bunch of your stuff, starting with express and jade
[02:50] LukeBrookhart: love it, btw
[02:50] tjholowaychuk: LukeBrookhart thanks!
[02:50] Stephen: These objects have the user who deployed them on the url's username attached
[02:50] LukeBrookhart: No, thank YOU
[02:50] wingie: chrisdickinson: every package should be "npm test" compatible
[02:50] LukeBrookhart: it's incredible
[02:50] wingie: make things easier
[02:50] chrisdickinson: wingie: agreed
[02:50] wingie: "npm test", "semver convention" .. what a wonderful world it would be!
[02:51] LukeBrookhart: I'm still trying to get things worked out on it
[02:51] Stephen: Therein is the problem for HTTPS, a history of a user visiting. I'd like to conform to the security of HTTPS while still allowing them to be in the game
[02:51] Stephen: So, I was thinking, remove the usernames
[02:51] wingie: you know what .. isaacs should prohibit people from publishing apps without the "test" script in package.json
[02:51] Stephen: All objects are anonymous on HTTPS, security preserved.
[02:51] wingie: force every package to be unit tested
[02:51] LukeBrookhart: keep getting "handshake error"
[02:51] Stephen: However, I'd like to also keep that security server side
[02:51] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[02:52] lem0nbyte: wingie: would not stop the numerous broken ones
[02:52] bradleymeck has joined the channel
[02:52] lem0nbyte: but it's a start :)
[02:52] Stephen: Since users get "points" for their objects being found, I need some way to attach these objects to the url hash, and a way to track when they've been used up to award the points to the original user
[02:52] SubStack: wingie: npm ls or search.npmjs.org could show packages with tests more prominently
[02:52] wingie: lem0nbyte: yeah but kinda forces a responsibility upon you .. it should also run "npm test" for all published packages
[02:52] Stephen: but in an anonymous manner
[02:52] tjholowaychuk: all i want is for $ npm search
[02:52] tjholowaychuk: to not take 20 seconds
[02:52] tjholowaychuk: haha
[02:53] Stephen: I was thinking a bloom filter might work in this instance. Any thoughts?
[02:53] lem0nbyte: wingie: platform/environment requirements make that infeasible imo
[02:53] wingie: so it just publishes packages that passes tests
[02:53] SubStack: tjholowaychuk: when I run anything with npm on an ec2 server it's amazingly fast
[02:53] tjholowaychuk: lem0nbyte yeah agreed
[02:53] tjholowaychuk: annoying more than anything
[02:53] tjholowaychuk: SubStack: really?
[02:53] tjholowaychuk: weird
[02:53] SubStack: but everywhere else it's laggy as fuck
[02:53] tjholowaychuk: npm itself is fine usually but search
[02:53] tjholowaychuk: is brutally slow
[02:53] sorensen: agreed
[02:53] abraxas: tjholowaychuk: hey, i noticed you've been doing a lot of work on zeromq, awesome job
[02:53] innociv has joined the channel
[02:54] tjholowaychuk: real	0m8.814s
[02:54] tjholowaychuk: better than usual
[02:54] wingie: SubStack: how?
[02:54] abraxas: tjholowaychuk: was that all cleanup work or did it actually move forward feature-wise as well?
[02:54] tjholowaychuk: abraxas a lot of it was cleanup
[02:54] a_suenami has joined the channel
[02:55] tjholowaychuk: and tests etc
[02:55] abraxas: tjholowaychuk: and node 0.6, right?
[02:55] innociv has joined the channel
[02:55] tjholowaychuk: ye ye
[02:55] abraxas: tjholowaychuk: i'm wondering what made it version 2 all of the sudden? :)
[02:55] tjholowaychuk: it might be broken on 0.6.x still, we're still using 0.4.x
[02:55] tjholowaychuk: in prod
[02:55] wingie: lem0nbyte: im sure SubStack will take care of that .. they take care of all testing scenarios
[02:56] abraxas: tjholowaychuk: so are we, would love to move on to 0.6 though, a lot of free performance gain
[02:56] wingie: would be a good marketing too .. "package tested with Testling"
[02:56] tjholowaychuk: abraxas yeah definitely
[02:56] tjholowaychuk: the binding isnt as fast as it should be
[02:56] tjholowaychuk: but i'll work on that later
[02:56] tjholowaychuk: not a huge deal for now
[02:57] abraxas: tjholowaychuk: and what about zeromq protocol support? still the old one, right?
[02:57] SubStack: wingie: I have a project in the works for providing travis-style testling badges
[02:57] SubStack: also in the process of adding testling tests to a lot of my modules
[02:57] tjholowaychuk: abraxas 2x i believe we have a patch for 3x
[02:57] SubStack: browserify just got some
[02:57] andrewfff has joined the channel
[02:57] abraxas: tjholowaychuk: cool, looking forward to that
[02:57] tjholowaychuk: me too

[02:58] abraxas: tjholowaychuk: i have to admit though, it's not actually clear to me what v3 offers...
[02:58] jeromebasa has left the channel
[02:59] tjholowaychuk: abraxas one of the best things IMO is pub-side filtering
[02:59] wingie: SubStack: cool .. better tests -> better code -> everyone happy
[02:59] SubStack: agree!
[02:59] tjholowaychuk: abraxas so if a subscriber doesn't want something it's just never sent
[02:59] SubStack: just have to get more paying users in the meantime
[02:59] abraxas: tjholowaychuk: ah great! yeah, that seems pretty inefficient now
[02:59] SubStack: so that our runway doesn't run out
[02:59] tjholowaychuk: when have millions of messages per second it's kind of a meh
[02:59] tjholowaychuk: but
[03:00] tjholowaychuk: depends what you're doing I suppose
[03:00] SubStack: wingie: I'll be a bit busy overhauling the browserling code for the next month or so unfortunately
[03:00] fbartho has joined the channel
[03:00] abraxas: tjholowaychuk: well, it's one of the reasons we are using req/rep, and no pub whatsoever
[03:01] tjholowaychuk: i see
[03:01] SubStack: the first phase of that should go live tomorrow
[03:01] SubStack: it's so freaking pretty
[03:01] innociv_ has joined the channel
[03:01] abraxas: tjholowaychuk: anyway, thanks for all the work, we really appreciate it :) it's nice to see node-zeromq maintained well
[03:01] SubStack: hopefully that translates into a higher conversion rate
[03:02] sorensen: SubStack: i'll convert for you
[03:02] sorensen: ;)
[03:02] wingie: SubStack: we see simpler and more elegant things arise, Travis > Hudson, StackVM > Saucelabs/Selenium
[03:03] tjholowaychuk: saucelabs is pretty.. different than travis :p
[03:03] wingie: SubStack: isn't saucelabs more like stackvm
[03:03] SubStack: yes
[03:03] wingie: but using selenium
[03:03] wingie: not a CI 
[03:04] SubStack: selenium is terrible but mature
[03:04] tjholowaychuk: hahaha yeah
[03:04] tjholowaychuk: it sucks
[03:04] SubStack: testling is awesome but crazy immature
[03:04] jldbasa has joined the channel
[03:04] wingie: you have to test more!
[03:04] wingie: :D
[03:05] ryan_stevens: testling is cool
[03:05] wingie: what a bad joke haha
[03:05] SubStack: also browserling is going to get crazy awesome fairly soon
[03:06] wingie: could you give us a peek?
[03:06] SubStack: real IEs, encoder server hopping and more dynamic routing
[03:06] SubStack: well I have an old screenshot of the redesign kicking around
[03:06] SubStack: that's just the front page though

[03:09] wingie: but could be nice to just read about since it's about testing (i always had some problems testing in either Sproutcore or ExtJS since they don't do usual HTML)
[03:09] sorensen: not much you can do
[03:09] sorensen: one of the bad parts about how we do things at work is that we could only use browserling against our production site
[03:09] Vennril has joined the channel
[03:09] sorensen: since nothing else is accessable
[03:09] SubStack: haha look at http://substack.net/images/screenshots/browserling-1.png

[03:10] SubStack: sorensen: you can use ssh tunnels for that
[03:10] SubStack: to proxy through your localhost or intranet deploy into browserling
[03:10] sorensen: o rly?
[03:10] SubStack: there's an ssh button in the interface
[03:10] wingie: cool theme
[03:10] sorensen: this i did not know
[03:10] SubStack: yep!
[03:10] SubStack: it's more obvious on the redesigned website
[03:11] sorensen: how much to get true IE?
[03:11] SubStack: coming soon to dev plans
[03:11] SubStack: at regular dev plan price
[03:11] sorensen: i think we would be able to utilize it

[03:12] SubStack: you'll also be able to get a dedicated instance for more monies
[03:12] sorensen: do you ever wonder if the hand drawn art will discourage people?
[03:13] innociv__ has joined the channel
[03:13] sorensen: not that i dont love the hand drawn art

[03:13] sorensen: this would make a very good a/b testing study
[03:14] sorensen: hand drawn sexyness vs. sleek / shiny
[03:14] wingie: a good thing is that you kinda see that they are developers .. much better than having a company full of managers Selling you things
[03:14] SubStack: it's even more hand drawn now than before
[03:14] wingie: i hate those sites
[03:14] Aria has joined the channel
[03:14] SubStack: but it's fancier at the same time
[03:14] sorensen: this is wha twould make it a good a/b test
[03:14] sorensen: since its targeted at devs
[03:14] lem0nbyte: it is, except the 'pricing' 'create account' and 'sign in' text are kinda blah
[03:14] sorensen: we can study ourselves!
[03:15] wingie: SubStack: who drew it?
[03:15] sorensen: oh yeah? well you're a lemon
[03:15] lem0nbyte: rest is sexy hand drawing
[03:15] sorensen: :D
[03:15] SubStack: wingie: I draw and design everything
[03:15] wingie: cool .. i thought devs couldn't draw
[03:15] SubStack: FALSE
[03:15] sorensen: ACTION can draw
[03:15] SubStack: they're just lazy

[03:16] SubStack: drawing is easy, just spend a few thousand hours in inkscape with a wacom
[03:16] sorensen: substack's style is what stands out most
[03:16] sorensen: is wacom bamboo?
[03:16] wingie: but why did you draw everything?
[03:16] SubStack: affirmative
[03:16] sorensen: i've been thinking about getting one
[03:16] SubStack: wingie: because I'm poor
[03:16] sorensen: what size would you recommend?
[03:17] wingie: SubStack: that is about to change!
[03:17] SubStack: hiring a designer would take out several months or runway
[03:17] wingie: the more we test .. the richer you get!
[03:17] jocafa: i want the Inkling
[03:17] lem0nbyte: well technically could make the middle box css3 and leave the logo/bg hand drawn, would still look nice
[03:17] SubStack: wingie: yep
[03:17] wingie: SubStack: yeah but i meant you could have reused icons etc 
[03:18] wingie: from some place
[03:18] SubStack: I did reuse the icons from testling
[03:18] sorensen: :P
[03:18] sorensen: the bg and logo would be the only thing i can see that would need to be unique
[03:18] sorensen: errry thing else, iconfinder and css
[03:19] sorensen: if that was the style he was going for of course
[03:19] SubStack: I drew all the browsers for http://substack.net/images/browsers/war_of_the_browsers.png
[03:19] wingie: sorensen: or you could do like facebook just have regular text
[03:19] wingie: what i am doing for my app :)
[03:19] sorensen: how ordinary
[03:19] wingie: perhaps having it *bold*
[03:19] lem0nbyte: beep boop

[03:29] okee: I know that node.js is snappy, but is it faster than nginx for web servers?
[03:29] wingie: abraxas: the japanese customers talk english?

[03:31] innociv_ has joined the channel
[03:31] RLa: okee, node is good for lots of long-lived open connections, traditional web servers are not

[03:32] astropirate: So whats the strategy on load balancing websocket servers?
[03:32] enmand has joined the channel
[03:33] spleeze has joined the channel
[03:33] okee: I hear that nginx is a lot more predictable than most.  However, you can write a program that compensates for load -- at least in most cases.
[03:34] astropirate: okee, nginx doesn't have support for websockets unfortunatly
[03:34] bradleymeck: astropirate, basically you are stuck with some custom node-http-proxy stuff
[03:34] ryah: okee: nginx is fine - but it's not programmable - you need some way to build dynamic content
[03:34] okee: So what types of apps should I avoid that need web socket servers?
[03:34] EyePulp: any way to have npm clear out old modules under the local /node_modules/ if they're no longer listed in the package.json?
[03:34] ryah: so it's not really the same use-case as node
[03:35] briandh has joined the channel
[03:35] ryah: there is some overlap in the static file case. which node can serve fine.
[03:35] EyePulp: other than me doing rm -rf, that is...
[03:35] rwaldron has joined the channel
[03:35] ryah: unfortunately it seems that a lot of the modules for serving static files in node are really bad
[03:36] ryah: stating on each request, etc
[03:36] astropirate: ryah, stating?
[03:36] tjfontaine: stat()'ing
[03:36] astropirate: i see
[03:36] ryah: astropirate: making the stat syscall
[03:37] ryah: it would be nice if someone wrote a good static file server
[03:37] ryah: which cached fds
[03:38] ryah: (maybe calling fstatSync on them)
[03:38] ryah: etc
[03:38] ryah: nginx is more or less the optimal static file server
[03:38] SubStack: pow new module for replications https://github.com/substack/node-replicant
[03:38] SubStack: no logic for conflict resolution yet
[03:39] ryah: it would be good to look at how it does that (for example https://github.com/git-mirror/nginx/blob/master/src/http/ngx_http_file_cache.c)
[03:42] tjfontaine: SubStack: I had done something not unlike this, if yours supplied some sort of time based key for simple conflict resolution I would use it in a heart beat
[03:42] SubStack: tjfontaine: the plan is to do it couch-style with a rev field
[03:43] SubStack: then I'll just re-run the transactions STM-style for conflicts

[03:55] webSockets: Do I need websockets?
[03:55] briandh: Yes.
[03:55] webSockets: When would I use them?
[03:56] comet: when you need to use them
[03:56] briandh: When you require them.
[03:56] webSockets: When should I require them?
[03:56] comet: or when they require you
[03:56] sorensen: :D

[03:56] harthur has joined the channel
[03:57] sorensen: i prefer websockets

[03:57] sorensen: and falling back
[03:57] jesusabdullah: It's really not much more complicated than that
[03:57] briandh: Why proxy them through nginx?
[03:57] webSockets: Why do you prefer websockets?
[03:57] jesusabdullah: except for the answer, "use socket.io"
[03:57] sorensen: ^--
[03:57] comet: comets and shooting stars
[03:57] webSockets: I am new to node.js, and don't know what I am doing.  I do know Javascript.
[03:58] sorensen: sockets arent new to node.js
[03:58] briandh: If you know Javascript, you should use websockets.
[03:58] context: if you don't now what web sockets are you dont need them 
[03:58] sorensen: you should always use them when appropriate
[03:58] markq: okee: my advice. use socket.io with node and only node for now
[03:58] context: and if you can't see a reason for them then you dont need them currently

[03:59] sorensen: its quite a different social environment
[03:59] okee: The only thing oddbal with the site that I am working on is that some of the items are sold as components, and can be bundled as a group.  I would think Ajax would be more appropriate for that, since users can ad and drop components as they want before final checkout.
[03:59] markq: war every 5 seconds
[04:00] sorensen: yep
[04:00] sorensen: the main reason to use sockets, imo, is when you want to push data to the clients

[04:21] context: sorensen: sorry. i have a hatred for people. ;) people forgot that its ok to try things out and break things, even on purpose, just to see how they work, or find answers to things without waiting for someone to spoon it to them :-/
[04:21] sorensen: context: agreed

[04:22] sorensen: = java/c++/masm
[04:23] sorensen: html/js/css? "oh you dont need those" - every professor
[04:23] markq: i think it's possible to learn nearly everything from just googling
[04:23] sorensen: agreed
[04:23] context: yeah I skipped college :/ I argued with my professors the year and a half I went there and got in trouble for writing code that we shorter and faster cause I had already done that crap in self study

[04:24] sorensen: though i will say a traditional background in comp sci is very handy
[04:24] context: ok kids. pull out your html4 books. it's a decade old but we gonna learn your ass a lot of useless knowledge 
[04:24] markq: haha exactly
[04:24] sorensen: knowing the js -> c -> assembly isnt bad ;)

[04:25] paulwe has joined the channel
[04:25] cmr: The only "web design" class I ever took was in middle school, and we didn't learn a single thing about html or css... we learned how to drag and drop in kompozer
[04:25] markq: in general college comp sci classes are almost instantly outdated unless they teach the most basic principles
[04:25] sorensen: though you wont really gain anything usefull until you either do it in produciton or take a 300 level class
[04:25] sorensen: context: asm is fun as hell

[04:25] sorensen: markq: thats the only thing to take them for

[05:07] cmr: s/firstance/first instance/ # must be late
[05:08] Guest63552: I am watching the introduction to node.js by the founder and am wondering about the persistent nature of the http server that he creates in the beginning of the video, in the example he illustrates the chucked data by sending hello followed by world 2 seconds later to the http client, in the video this is illustrated using curl, my question/curiosity is in the persistant nature of a http client such as a browser, I suspect unlike curl, the r
[05:09] Guest63552: Or would the browser act like the same way that ajax occurs, event oriented?
[05:09] cmr: Guest63552: What persistent nature?
[05:10] cmr: Guest63552: your first message was truncated btw... should get a better client
[05:10] Guest63552: The "keep-alive" property that allows chunked data in http 1.1.
[05:10] Guest63552: Where did it die?
[05:11] cmr: "I suspect unlike curl, the r"
[05:11] Aria: "unlike curl, the r"...
[05:11] Guest63552: unlike curl, the request is rendered not immdediatly, that is, the 2 second pause between the hello and world isn't shown, but rather it is similar to previous http 1.1 request in that the browser would render the content all at once... Is this true?
[05:11] mattgifford has joined the channel
[05:11] Aria: most browsers don't usably expose chunks -- but browsers aren't the only consumers of HTTP
[05:11] EyePulp has joined the channel
[05:11] Aria: Actually, though, browsers will render what they get and add more as it comes in in simple cases.
[05:12] Aria: They usually hold off starting to render until they get enough or some time has passed.
[05:12] Guest63552: like imgs
[05:12] Aria: But after that, they go into a live updating mode.
[05:12] Aria: What's like imgs?

[06:09] _Tristan: Hey. How can I prevent race conditions with node.js? I'm writing a basic webserver and if I request a bunch of files at the same time it'll deliver them to the wrong connections by mistake sometimes.
[06:10] SubStack: _Tristan: gist your code and we'll take a look?
[06:10] sirwan: Anyone know what the best way of Keeping Node up and running after I close SSH
[06:11] SubStack: sirwan: forever, screen, monit, tmux
[06:11] SubStack: lots of ways
[06:11] sirwan: forever doesn't work with the latest node and debian
[06:11] jjd has joined the channel
[06:11] sirwan: does monit need upstart ?
[06:11] _Tristan: ok, but it's kind of ugly. https://gist.github.com/1569284
[06:11] maxogden: sirwan: you can use upstart
[06:11] RLa: _Tristan, there are no race conditions since node is single-threaded
[06:12] sirwan: maxogden: I'm bait confused. does monit need upstart to work. or are monit and upstart 2 different viable options to get node up and running after i close
[06:12] maxogden: sirwan: firstly node isnt any different from any other process so your question isn't really node specific
[06:13] maxogden: sirwan: secondly upstart and monit have overlapping functionality, yes
[06:13] sirwan: maxogden: ok
[06:13] Shaunzie: _Tristan: http://nodetuts.com/tutorials/3-flush-the-cat-filesystem-reading-files-streams-slow-clients-and-syspump.html#video
[06:13] SubStack: _Tristan: it looks like you could just use a module to load those static assets
[06:13] dgathright has joined the channel
[06:13] SubStack: if you're using express there's express.static and likewise for connect
[06:13] mara has joined the channel

[06:15] ly- has joined the channel
[06:15] markq: i wish there was an easy way to compare which module works better in terms of performance and ease-of-use
[06:16] SubStack: looking at the readme on github works pretty well
[06:16] markq: if there are multiple modules that do the same thing then i also tend to look at the number if open issues to see how many people are actually using that particular module
[06:17] markq: don't know if that's really a correct way to gauge stability though
[06:18] SubStack: issues aren't very informative
[06:18] SubStack: the most active modules tend to have more issues so you can't compare them without normalizing
[06:18] maxogden: reading the code works pretty well
[06:18] SubStack: and authors differ in how they handle github issues
[06:18] voodootikigod__ has joined the channel
[06:19] SubStack: good things to look for: presence of tests, npm stars, other modules depend on this one

[06:23] sirwan: anyone know if forever works with the latest version of NodeJS and debian 6 ?
[06:24] SubStack: what would debian have to do with anything?
[06:25] sirwan: not sure i used forever before and it crashed the entire server
[06:25] sirwan: some of its commands doesn't even work with the latest nodejs
[06:25] markq: then something else is wrong with your config
[06:25] sirwan: ok
[06:25] sirwan: it was a fresh install
[06:25] markq: i just compiled node listerally 1 min ago and I'm running forever now
[06:25] RLa: debian 6 still uses sysv init, sure that does not cause problems?
[06:26] sirwan: not sure RLa 
[06:26] sirwan: markq: is that with debian ?
[06:26] markq: ubuntu
[06:26] sirwan: 11.04 ?
[06:26] markq: yep
[06:26] RLa: ubuntu uses upstart, completely different
[06:26] sirwan: mark mind giving me a memory dump of your ubuntu
[06:26] sirwan: yes i think upstart must have screwed with forever some how
[06:27] sirwan: but i have read though, some of the forever commands do not work with the latest nodejs
[06:27] RLa: tho upstart was supposed to be 100% with sysvinit
[06:27] RLa: compatible*
[06:27] sirwan: not sure to be honest rla
[06:28] sirwan: isn't ryan thinking of having node be an entire service running on a server in the future? 
[06:28] sirwan: like replacing nginx and apchage
[06:29] mdel has joined the channel
[06:29] RLa: well, it can serve static content, so i suppose it could replace those
[06:29] RLa: but running on top of those?
[06:30] pcaulagi has joined the channel
[06:30] sirwan: running on top of those is a pain to setup
[06:31] sirwan: specially if this going to be a defacto development platform in the future
[06:33] SubStack: sirwan: I hope not
[06:33] SubStack: that shit should be in userland
[06:34] sirwan: could this not potentially be forked in the future
[06:34] SubStack: be vigilant against scope creep
[06:34] SubStack: build experiments as separate projects
[06:34] bradleymeck: god help us if it is a service, like half of my node code would be unusable
[06:35] sirwan: well i think it would be cool to branch it as a service
[06:35] sirwan: npm could be built into node too
[06:36] bradleymeck: all the CLI apps would die, and the multitude of service detections (is it http, smtp, ...) would be insane
[06:36] bradleymeck: sirwan npm is bundled with node now :)
[06:36] sirwan: sounds good, some of the modules should be bundled with it too
[06:36] rauchg has joined the channel
[06:36] bradleymeck: but as for a service, haibu is pretty close if you just give it some process manager loving
[06:36] bradleymeck: sirwan nah, leave that to distributions
[06:37] sirwan: yes, ill give forever another try
[06:37] sirwan: before i get too skeptical with the setting up of node for general purposes
[06:37] cmr: SubStack: do you do your own artwork?
[06:37] SubStack: cmr: affirmative
[06:37] bradleymeck: sirwan forever's service branch is borken due to some compat problems, its going to be rewritten after haibu port to 0.6 and multi version is done in next 24 hours, so probably in next week
[06:38] cmr: SubStack: it's pretty good, and a nice touch.
[06:38] bradleymeck: sirwan i would just use upstart with haibu or w/e you have
[06:38] RLa: i usually make simple init script containing nohup command, works with all kinds of apps/services

[10:10] martin_sunset: Ansh I am sorry but I am too tired to make sense of this right now. Are you using express at all? 
[10:10] ansh: martin :
[10:10] ansh: martin: sorry , nut i m nor using express mvc but railway
[10:11] ansh: martin: and for form validation i ve to use express-form module
[10:12] martin_sunset: Ansh I see. Can't really help you then, only glanced over it. But in general the important part with form validation is that it has to be injected as middleware, most likely within the action parameter
[10:12] kulor-uk has joined the channel
[10:14] ansh: martin: ok,can u tell me the line why the app.post is used in readme example
[10:14] bradleyg has joined the channel

[10:14] martin_sunset: Basically,
[10:15] herbySk has joined the channel

[10:20] mara has joined the channel
[10:20] ansh: martin: thanx but i know tht yourvalidation function will be used to validate but wht code ll be written there coz i dont need the code var app = express.createServer();  like tht coz i already have created sserver
[10:21] ansh: martin: i want only this part  to validate my form  form(     filter("username").trim(),     validate("username").required().is(/^[a-z]+$/),     filter("password").trim(),     validate("password").required().is(/^[0-9]+$/),     filter("email").trim(),     validate("email").isEmail()   ),    // Express request-handler now receives filtered and validated data   function(req, res){     if (!req.form.isValid) {       // Handle errors       
[10:22] ansh: martin : sorry here is the part  http://pastebin.com/XvptewRc
[10:23] ansh: martin : i dont need var app = express.createServer();  and app.post thing in my code
[10:23] martin_sunset: Ansh the sample on the readme is a complete server, hats why the code is there. What you need to do is to pass the form as the seond parameter of the action method
[10:24] ansh: martin: ok

[10:36] martin_sunset: You need to check if action supports middleware and if it passes req, res with its callback. In general I think though that using railway is not the best idea

[10:52] nickynyfiken: The past year I have been developing on ruby on rails but want to try node.js out. What I want to build is web "apps". I have a couple of questions I want to discuss if anyone has any experience in the subject. First is what do you think of single page apps where the server only has 1 static layout and all the rendering is done on the client? the disadvandatage is of course the hash mark but that could be solved in numerous ways
[10:52] amigojapan has joined the channel
[10:53] martin_sunset: nickynyfiken: It depends ;) 
[10:53] nickynyfiken: I never want to do a page refresh. so I am either going to go with just pure ajax on the client, or pjax so I can get nice urls and use the back and forward functionaliy or something like socket.io which is my question should I use socket.io or is that not what it is for?
[10:53] nickynyfiken: martin_sunset: yeah I know it always does :)
[10:54] nickynyfiken: but I mean should YOU render templates on the server and use websocket or pjax to get the views html or should you render them om the client?
[10:54] martin_sunset: nickynyfiken: For single page app always transfer Json and render on the client
[10:54] nickynyfiken: martin_sunset:  ok cool that I have experince in so good. are you familiar with pjax?
[10:55] martin_sunset: nickynyfiken: I have looked at it, but not used it. 
[10:55] goloroden has left the channel
[10:55] spohnan has joined the channel
[10:55] nickynyfiken: or what about the nice urls how should I else get them? use history.js or something?
[10:55] martin_sunset: nickynyfiken: Check out flatiron, they have a great router
[10:55] nickynyfiken: I am going to use backbone on the client and it has pushState as an option
[10:55] nickynyfiken: as well as a router
[10:56] nickynyfiken: martin_sunset: have you used rails?
[10:56] martin_sunset: Backbone router works too, personally I switched to director though
[10:56] martin_sunset: nickynyfiken: Our app is 50 percent rails, 50 node
[10:56] nickynyfiken: or has anyone else used rails and are familiar with asset pipepline? has node something similiar for compiling coffeescript etc
[10:57] nickynyfiken: as soon as I get it up and running with the config I wil have no problem but don't see it as clearly as for example a rails project
[10:57] martin_sunset: nickynyfiken: Nothing as good as the asset pipeline unfortunately, there is some asset middleware, for coffeescript I use watch flag , same for stylus

[10:58] zomg: nickynyfiken: socket.io is good if you need two-way comms, or a lot of push from the server. If not, then it might be simpler to just use "standard" ajax
[10:58] nickynyfiken: zomg ok cool because I dont want to invole stuff just because if they don't benefit me
[10:58] zomg: for nice urls, recent browsers support the html5 history api, which lets you modify the URL "live", and not just the hash part
[10:59] zomg: for older browsers you'd need to fall back to the hash, but there are libs that can handle that for you
[10:59] nickynyfiken: zomg:  yeah there is a library called history.js that I think I will use for that
[10:59] zomg: Yeah that's one I think
[10:59] nickynyfiken: yeah it got fallbacks for html 4 etc
[10:59] Industrial: There is also BatmanJS :P
[10:59] Industrial: but it's larely alpha

[11:20] goloroden: I now understand that the debug parameters starts Node's integrated debug client that lets me access the running app. help says that the --debug switch enables V8 debugger, so obviously the integrated one is not started. Why would I want to do this?
[11:20] spohnan has left the channel
[11:21] meso has joined the channel
[11:21] goloroden: Okay, I would want to do this, e.g., when running node-inspector to have debugging enabled, but not running inside the node process since it's not where I am debugging
[11:21] nickynyfiken: so if I am going to build I single page app with node I will just use express on the server to set up a defualt route to / where I serve a static html file and then on the client manipulate it and set up express resources and define routes for them so I can get them with ajax on the client? have I gotten it right?
[11:21] booyaa: arse bloody integration auth in iis is a pile of steaming do do
[11:21] goloroden: So does using "debug" include "--debug"? Which means: debug activates debugging (just as --debug), but ALSO starts the debuging console within node?

[16:54] y_nk: booyaa: i ran someone's websocket server who's from pusher, it works, but it's written on a http.createServer basis
[16:54] booyaa: y_nk: ah
[16:54] y_nk: i dug in his code, and did the same algorithm
[16:55] zomg: y_nk: alright, sounds good then :D
[16:55] y_nk: but i'm still not able to complete the handshake and did not succeed in finding where it fails :|

[16:57] chadskidmore has joined the channel
[16:57] y_nk: mmalecki: it looks like, however i can see it's written on a http package basis too, which is -for me- the only thing that differs from my own implementation

[16:58] wtfizzle has joined the channel
[16:58] mmalecki: y_nk: I know, but I figured out that logic behind calculating handshakes would be fairly similiar

[16:58] y_nk: mmalecki: thanks :)
[16:59] isaacs: scott_gonzalez: i did start down that path once, and i don't recall what blocker i hit.
[16:59] y_nk: i found that one which is the most understandable because of its size : https://github.com/miksago/node-websocket-server

[17:00] isaacs: scott_gonzalez: i did just release npm 1.1.0-beta-10
[17:00] scott_gonzalez: I just noticed it with my test data, which has hundreds of pre-releases :-P
[17:00] isaacs: which is dumb, i should know better, and do -10-beta
[17:00] y_nk: zomg: booyaa:mmalecki: i feel like i'm having an encoding issue with calculating handshake since i get some chars that dont look *normal*

[20:36] SubStack: _Tristan: fs functions return buffers by default. You can .toString() them
[20:36] bradleymeck: plow write to a tmp file, upload from the tmp file when it completes?
[20:36] plow: bradleymeck: is that better than memory purely?
[20:37] techwraith: bingomanatee__: No way to tell? Damn.
[20:37] dragon: plow: what's the expected action if upload is interrupted?
[20:37] deusprogrammer: I am wrapping FreeIPMI so I can use it in Node.
[20:37] plow: dragon: what is normally?
[20:37] ohnopb has left the channel
[20:37] bradleymeck: plow define *better* it lets you retry if the upload finishes but for some reason the push to db does not
[20:37] bradleymeck: but it will be slower
[20:37] techwraith: bingomanatee__: any suggestions on how to get that in without having to pass it into the module?
[20:37] plow: bradleymeck: how do most node.js websites do it?
[20:37] mightym has joined the channel
[20:37] bingomanatee__: no. Just pass it in. 
[20:37] deusprogrammer: I could just write a FreeIPMI library completely in Node, but it would take too long.
[20:38] bingomanatee__: That insulates you from version creep
[20:38] dragon: plow: typical action would be to not save any part of the file, so it will make sense not to write it to the DB until the upload has succeeded.
[20:38] relix has joined the channel
[20:38] plow: dragon: so you're saying save as a temp file and then upload to DB~?

[20:38] salazr_ has joined the channel

[20:39] plow: dragon: can I get away with a 200kb in memory for many users?
[20:39] dnyy has joined the channel
[20:39] dragon: deusprogrammer: fair enough. It's better to wrap than to re-write.
[20:39] bingomanatee__: techwraith: even if you can do it now, they might change the underlying mechanics of node in the future -- but if you pass it in manually, you are pretty much protected from further node development. 
[20:39] dragon: plow: how many users will concurrently upload such files in production?
[20:40] plow: dragon: it's a central part of the app, now that I see, it will only likely be max of 25kb, probably 200-300 hundred a sec ideally
[20:40] plow: 50-100 for now
[20:40] deusprogrammer: dragon: And I understand how to wrap functions and classes, but I am unsure of how to contend with asynchronous I/O.  Do I need to worry about it, only if I want to pass a function pointer into the functions?
[20:40] cognominal has joined the channel

[20:42] bingomanatee__: I think you are over thinking the problem when you already have a working solution. 
[20:42] larsschenk has joined the channel
[20:42] dragon: deusprogrammer: your wrapper will invoke the async callback when the library completes the task.
[20:43] dragon: best bet is to not try to make the library async.
[20:43] bodisiw has joined the channel
[20:43] bingomanatee__: The point of knowing your caller is to ask it for information -- and you should be passing all that information into your module as parameters anyway.

[20:44] deusprogrammer: One more question and I will leave you all alone for now.

[20:45] dnyy has joined the channel
[20:45] deusprogrammer: What does recv refer to?
[20:45] bingomanatee__: Consider that you will be unit testing this at some point -- you will want to be able to pass in or mock everything the module needs to do its business, 
[20:45] techwraith: bingomanatee__: But in this case it would always be the same - figure out what directory this file is in and pass it in.

[20:47] ohnopb has joined the channel
[20:48] djbell has joined the channel
[20:48] tjholowaychuk: insin they just compile to regular js functions so it's probably a scope issue
[20:48] MooGoo: regardless...if it is a required parameter
[20:48] MooGoo: pretty sure for the expression obj.func() obj is the reciver
[20:48] MooGoo: thus this
[20:49] mightym: tjholowaychuk: same effect :-(
[20:49] deusprogrammer: I am reading the V8 Documentation about Context::GetCurrent()...but I still don't really get it...what about the global proxy object is receiving something from the function being called?
[20:51] insin: tjholowaychuk: one other thing - if I try to output a variable which happens to be a function, it shows the source of the function - you would be against making it call functions in that scenario? e.g. here: field.labelTag is a function: https://github.com/insin/iswydt/blob/master/views/mixins/forms.jade
[20:51] ohnopb: npm ls
[20:51] insin: s/you would/would you/
[20:51] ohnopb: oop
[20:51] deusprogrammer: Perhaps I just don't understand what a context is.
[20:51] dragon: ohnopb: if you're on linux, `netstat -nltp` will show all the programs with relevant open network ports.
[20:51] bodisiw has joined the channel
[20:51] ohnopb: os x
[20:51] tjholowaychuk: insin yeah i dont like ambiguous stuff like that
[20:51] tjholowaychuk: plus
[20:51] tjholowaychuk: it's just regular js
[20:51] MooGoo: deusprogrammer: the global object is the default receiver when none other is specified
[20:52] tjholowaychuk: we would have to check the retval of each thing for a function
[20:52] tjholowaychuk: so it would slow everything down
[20:52] insin: yeah, I dig the consistency of it just being regular JS
[20:52] insin: cheers
[20:52] deusprogrammer: MooGoo: I see...so you can specify different contexts to recv the function call?
[20:52] tjholowaychuk: i'll see if i can fix that mixin thing
[20:52] dragon: ohnopb: same command might work.
[20:52] MooGoo: deusprogrammer: just as you can in JS
[20:52] deusprogrammer: I'm guessing the global object is the main thread?
[20:53] mightym: well thank you anyway for your help!
[20:53] blueadept: what's the best way to check if an object value is an array with the ecmascript 5?
[20:53] insin: I'll give it another go to make sure - I might have stuck them outside a block, if that makes any difference
[20:53] deusprogrammer: I'm really sorry.  I'm not very good with Javascript yet.  I have been a low level C/C++ programmer for a long time.
[20:53] deusprogrammer: It's hard to learn something like this for me.
[20:53] MooGoo: dunno....v8 is tricky with the global object
[20:53] ohnopb: dragon:  got back "netstat option requires an argument -- p"

[20:54] MooGoo: but...well dont quote me on this but...func.call(recv, arg1, arg2) would be equivilent
[20:54] ohnopb: dragon: trying the list of choices it gave me now
[20:54] dragon: ohnopb: fair enough. Mac version has different command line arguments apparently.
[20:54] deusprogrammer: So is a context similar to how threading and context switching works at the OS level?
[20:54] MooGoo: no...not at all

[20:58] MooGoo: and the v8 docs are...not great
[20:58] dragon: Dreamer3: you're welcome!

[20:58] MooGoo: hmm....like KVM over IP?
[20:59] bradleymeck: deusprogrammer, just remember like in c/c++ it can be set to odd things
[20:59] dragon: plow: yes, redirect will do the job. You can add parameters to inform the destination page that the file upload failed.
[20:59] deusprogrammer: You can turn a machine on or off over LAN.  Check fan speeds, memory usage, CPU usage, open consoles.
[20:59] geekbri has joined the channel
[20:59] dragon: ACTION will be back later.
[20:59] deusprogrammer: I have never used KVM over IP.  Is it built into a system?
[20:59] dragon: and I think I just hilighted a wrong person.
[21:00] MooGoo: nah...requires external hardware...has been an option on some virtual hosts that I've used
[21:00] petrjanda has joined the channel
[21:00] deusprogrammer: That is the one thing I don't like about Nodejs is that I can't look at data at a byte level...it feels like all the layers of abstraction get in the way for me.
[21:00] MooGoo: but then in that case it probably is just some software
[21:00] ohnopb: dragon: what should i be getting back? looking at a list of active local domain sockets and connections but nothing node
[21:01] MooGoo: well....v8 does not make that easy
[21:01] overthemike_ has joined the channel
[21:01] deusprogrammer: MooGoo: iDRAC (which is Dell's proprietary software that runs on top of IPMI) utilizes KVM over LAN to allow for Virtual Console connections.
[21:01] pors has joined the channel
[21:02] MooGoo: but pretty sure node's Buffer object stores data outside the v8 heap
[21:02] deusprogrammer: V8 doesn't, but being able to code my extensions in C/C++ does made it a lot easier.
[21:02] bradleymeck: deusprogrammer, best you can do is use External's in v8::* and Buffers, they get you pretty much what you need, but byte inspection is not going to happen in a JIT nicely
[21:02] plow: dragon: even for ajax upload?
[21:03] adrianF has joined the channel
[21:03] deusprogrammer: The one thing I would love to have is the ability to cast a arbitrary memory location as a packed struct, and have it essentially parse the information for me.  But node can't do that right?
[21:03] tilgovi has joined the channel
[21:03] tilgovi has joined the channel
[21:04] MooGoo: well I guess you could do that in C++ land
[21:04] bradleymeck: deusprogrammer, correct it is not a byte level ABI
[21:04] deusprogrammer: Actually I guess I could write code that would take a struct descriptor of sorts and then create a struct like object from that with all the fields marked with prototyped variables.
[21:04] MooGoo: or maybe not
[21:04] strevat_ has joined the channel

[21:05] Shaunzie has joined the channel
[21:05] deusprogrammer: In other words, lets say I had a struct that represented a ethernet header.  In C/C++ I could just take the packet and cast the memory using a pointer to a structure of the ethernet header, and then have all the fields easily accessible from the struct.
[21:05] deusprogrammer: But in Node, I can't do that.  I would get back a hex buffer.
[21:06] deusprogrammer: I would have to go to each offset and extract the information.
[21:06] vkandy has joined the channel
[21:06] deusprogrammer: And the same goes for packing a structure and then sending it back out over the socket.
[21:06] phluffy has joined the channel
[21:07] phluffy has joined the channel
[21:07] bradleymeck: deusprogrammer, there are methods for reading data types on buffer like int shorts etc
[21:07] bradleymeck: there is a module that can even do single layer unwrapping ... i forget the name but it was on dailyjs a looong time ago
[21:08] deusprogrammer: I suppose, I could create a class in nodejs that would take a structure descriptor as a argument for it's constructor.  Then I could pass it a hex buffer.  It would then create data members and copy the information from the offsets into the members.
[21:08] deusprogrammer: Then when its time to send the data from a packed struct...it would convert it back into a hex buffer.
[21:08] deusprogrammer: But I wonder...does something like that already exist?
[21:08] deusprogrammer: If not, I will totally whip that up in my free time.

[22:31] joshsmith: how should I be creating a model if I want to test it with a fake express app?
[22:31] joshsmith: module.exports = function(app) { ... }?
[22:31] joshsmith: or should I be extending the prototype of a named function?

[22:34] martin_sunset: Thx josh
[22:34] r1ngzer0: joshsmith: cool, thx!
[22:35] joshsmith: not a problem
[22:35] joshsmith: either of you use express? I could use a returned favor
[22:35] martin_sunset: Yeah, I do
[22:35] joshsmith: do you ever fake your app for testing?
[22:36] martin_sunset: No, I always run it. 
[22:36] joshsmith: for example, I have MySQL configuration settings, and I want to inject an empty app as part of my mocking
[22:37] BrianE has joined the channel
[22:37] joshsmith: martin_sunset: ah. any particular reason?
[22:38] martin_sunset: Well, couldn't really figure out how to mock this well. Too much configuration going on
[22:38] tjholowaychuk: mocking is for wimps :p
[22:38] tjholowaychuk: jk
[22:38] tjholowaychuk: haha
[22:38] joshsmith: haha do you *not* mock tjholowaychuk?
[22:38] tjholowaychuk: but yeah, when testing your app it's usually a good idea to .. test your app
[22:38] tjholowaychuk: very rarely
[22:39] `3rdEden: he's just mocking you
[22:39] tjholowaychuk: the http part isnt really the slow part
[22:39] kickingvegas has joined the channel
[22:39] tjholowaychuk: db logic etc might be
[22:39] tjholowaychuk: but that will be slower anyway
[22:40] martin_sunset: It's faster than testing rails by a magnitude, that's good enough for me
[22:40] joshsmith: so do you guys just test your controllers and not your models then? or do both?
[22:40] gamera_ has joined the channel
[22:41] joshsmith: how do you start the app when running the tests martin_sunset?

[22:50] joshsmith: martin_sunset: I lived in all three cities
[22:51] martin_sunset: joshsmith: Nice. You are in San Diego now?
[22:51] joshsmith: sadly, no
[22:51] joshsmith: I'm in PA for 9 months

[22:52] jerrysv: joshsmith: only ask, as i just spent 5 days out in wilkes-barre area, would have loved to meet node folks
[22:52] joshsmith: jerrysv: ah, yeah. that's pretty far from here
[22:52] joshsmith: jerrysv: I don't even do Node at my job (though that may be changing!)
[22:52] martin_sunset: joshsmith: and where are you heading when you come back to CA?
[22:53] joshsmith: martin_sunset: idk yet; would prefer SD but there are compelling reasons to go to SF instead
[22:53] joshsmith: I might start working for a company soon that's in Palo Alto, so that would decide it for me

[22:55] joshsmith: martin_sunset: and there were some cool NoSQL meetups down in SD and stuff like that
[22:56] joshsmith: if I end up deciding to go to back to SD for whatever reason, I'm going to work my ass off to help kickstart the tech scene there

[22:59] overthemike_ has left the channel

[22:59] plow: TheJH: yep
[22:59] joshsmith: http://www.launchbit.com/
[22:59] TheJH: plow, arr.splice(arr.indexOf(element), 1)
[23:00] TheJH: plow, do NOT use delete for that!
[23:00] plow: TheJH: does that reindex everyting?
[23:00] TheJH: plow, yes
[23:00] plow: TheJH: so you _can_ use delete for objects then?
[23:00] TheJH: plow, delete doesn't reindex, but the empty areas still use some RAM
[23:00] TheJH: plow, yes
[23:00] torvalamo: delete doesn't collapse the array to a continuous index, it just leaves a hole
[23:01] plow: does arr.splice use a ref, so I don't need to reassign?
[23:01] andrenkov has joined the channel
[23:01] TheJH: plow, yes
[23:01] plow: super, thanks TheJH 
[23:01] TheJH: plow, splice modifies the original array
[23:01] cody-- has joined the channel
[23:01] plow: TheJH: got it, cheers
[23:01] TheJH: plow, on objects, delete is totally fine. on arrays, it's a bad idea because you get holes

[23:19] SubStack: I hate it when libraries take it upon themselves to spam the terminal with logging output.

[23:20] MatthewS has joined the channel
[23:20] mraleph: TheJH: on objects delete is a bad idea because object goes to slow case. of course it's fine if the object was already in slow case...
[23:20] SubStack: I don't care about that, they just make everything really noisy
[23:21] SubStack: so it's harder to debug my own stuff and the output gets in the way very quickly
[23:21] ryan_stevens: substack: yeah, I was jk
[23:21] TheJH: mraleph, oh, interesting
[23:21] SubStack: running into a case where socket.io's stupid default logging crap is crashing a service

[23:22] markq: how can i tell formidable to keep the same name of the file i upload through post?
[23:23] EyePulp has joined the channel
[23:23] SubStack: I don't mind it when you can opt in to logging but I hate it when that is the default
[23:24] `3rdEden: you can just turn it off
[23:24] `3rdEden: or have it use your own logging module
[23:24] `3rdEden: i really don't see the issue here
[23:25] `3rdEden: you got io.set('log level', level) to lower the output or silence it with -1. You can do io.set('log', false). and you can give it your own logger instance io.set('logger', logger instance);
[23:25] SubStack: `3rdEden: it's really hard to turn it off actually
[23:25] `3rdEden: how much more options do you want o_o
[23:25] SubStack: it's already turned off in dnode

[23:26] amigojapan has joined the channel

[23:26] SubStack: this stuff is really poorly documented is why it's such an issue
[23:26] `3rdEden: yup
[23:26] SubStack: apparently 'log level' of -1 isn't sufficient
[23:26] SubStack: and it ALSO needs log : false
[23:27] `3rdEden: if it's not, then it's a bug
[23:27] SubStack: what is this I don't even
[23:27] SubStack: and I hate this feature so much to start with
[23:27] SubStack: it's just compounding the hate
[23:27] `3rdEden: but anyways I'm going to bed gnite
[23:27] `3rdEden: poke rauchg about it :p

[23:28] rauchg: what's the issue ?
[23:29] rauchg: there's a whole wiki page explaining it
[23:29] rauchg: but i agree, the logger is actually gonna go away
[23:29] rauchg: very soon
[23:30] SubStack: hooray
[23:30] joshsmith: martin_sunset: where do you start your app in your tests? did I miss that?
[23:30] SubStack: getting this crashL http://pastebin.ca/2100572
[23:30] SubStack: s/L/:
[23:31] SubStack: fixed by also adding 'log : false'
[23:31] SubStack: in addition to the 'log level' : -1 that dnode adds

[23:40] BrianE: I prefer testing behaviour. This is in Rails land, not Node, mind
[23:40] BrianE: Good model tests are crucial, especially for more complex models
[23:40] BrianE: But testing controllers, at least as I've seen it done (again, Rails world) seems silly / not useful
[23:40] BrianE: Much better to test using capybara, and make sure you can actually use the features of your app as a user
[23:41] BrianE: So, I ask: Is there anything like capybara for Node / express? :)

[23:44] konobi: there's also things you can test in unit tests are are really hard to do on a running system
