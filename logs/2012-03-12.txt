[17:01] beakybal4: chapel: but I define socket
[17:01] beakybal4: or have I gone full retard?

[17:02] chapel: try that

[17:02] chapel: looking at the socket.io docs
[17:02] benvie: it's a good thing thst undefined coerces into the word "undefined" because that's a useful thing

[17:19] AntelopeSalad: i'm using it server side with 'spec'
[17:19] chapel: beakybal4: so no tweets are coming in
[17:19] chapel: you should test by sending your own messages/events
[17:19] beakybal4: chapel: no tweets are getting to the client
[17:19] AntelopeSalad: i set the slow variable to something really fast (5) and both of my tests take 20ms to do but neither of them show the duration

[17:38] benvie: let's see
[17:39] benvie: try client.emit('tweet', tweet)
[17:39] benvie: or something like that

[17:39] benvie: I don't know if socket.io wants you using send directly
[17:39] perezd_ has joined the channel
[17:40] initohen: one other question then: is there a particular reason that http.request and https.request are separate? or can you call http.request with an https url?

[17:40] beakybal4: benvie: error
[17:40] beakybal4: http://pastie.org/private/8ici8oqmzbwhyk8wx7ytcq
[17:40] benvie: hmm
[17:41] benvie: well it worked then
[17:41] RLa: initohen, you mean using same code/handler for accepting both http and https.request? yes

[17:41] beakybal4: yeah
[17:41] _baton_ has joined the channel

[18:09] beakybal4: i'm using the longurl api
[18:09] lohkey has joined the channel
[18:10] beakybal4: which works fine if i use it in php
[18:10] benvie: this is happening on the server though, shouldn't be an CORS stuff right?
[18:10] beakybal4: should i do a proxy or something? >.<
[18:10] beakybal4: oh no, client
[18:10] benvie: wait what's the path here?
[18:10] beakybal4: thinking of using a php thing
[18:10] beakybal4: uhh
[18:10] beakybal4: twitter --> server --> client
[18:10] benvie: yeah that's what I thought
[18:10] beakybal4: i was gonna do all the data processing on the client side
[18:11] chadskidmore has joined the channel
[18:11] benvie: yeah except yuo can't pull twitter directly to the client at your domain
[18:11] beakybal4: ohhh, no i wasn't gonna do that
[18:11] beakybal4: see i've pulled the url from the tweet
[18:11] lohkey: i thought twitter has some JSONP support
[18:11] beakybal4: that was easy enough
[18:11] benvie: does it? Maybe
[18:12] lohkey: yeah, i use it on my blog iirc
[18:12] beakybal4: no i'm expanding the short url
[18:12] beakybal4: *now
[18:12] benvie: oh I see
[18:12] benvie: so you're expanding the url on the client and that's the issue
[18:13] beakybal4: yeah
[18:13] benvie: which is the same thing, needs jsonp or they need to have CORS set up
[18:13] beakybal4: think i'll use php and do it server side :3
[18:13] benvie: or you do it on the backend
[18:13] benvie: you could process it in the node part =D
[18:13] rwaldron has joined the channel
[18:14] beakybal4: I guess :p
[18:14] benvie: there's a good chance they have a CORS thing set up so you can do it all legit like on the client

[18:14] CarterL: has anyone read Up and Running with node.js?
[18:15] beakybal4: uhh

[18:15] beakybal4: benvie: so I include cors
[18:16] beakybal4: then what? o.0
[18:16] benvie: well jsonp here so in your client app

[18:16] beakybal4: getCors(url,data,hander)

[18:16] beakybal4: jquery currently

[18:17] benvie: $.get('http://api.longurl.org/v2/services?=', { format: theformat })
[18:17] benvie: also it needs a header apparently, so one sec
[18:19] beakybal4: this is after i've included CORS, right? :3
[18:19] benvie: no disregard that
[18:19] benvie: cors is what replaces jsonp so if they're using jsonp it doesn't matter
[18:19] beakybal4: oh, kk
[18:19] beakybal4: cos i was using .getJSON and it failed :(
[18:20] benvie: just checking jquery's api for setting a custom header

[18:42] ProjectMoon: Phoenixz: where there is an error but it does not get raised
[18:43] robi42 has joined the channel
[18:43] Phoenixz: ProjectMoon: Errr.. And that happens how? Maybe an error level filter, like PHP? (strict, warning, notice, etc) ?
[18:43] ProjectMoon: Phoenixz: wait, you made the variable undefined or "undefined"
[18:43] benvie: expandURL('http://bit.ly/fakeurl', function(url){ console.log(url) })
[18:44] benvie: lol
[18:44] Phoenixz: ProjectMoon: With replicating this, it does not make sense.. IF "string" is undefined, it does not have a method replace().. But replace on a string has no problem with replacing with NULL or undefined..
[18:44] benvie: http://bit.ly/fakeurl is the url
[18:44] Phoenixz: ProjectMoon: undefined
[18:44] beakybal4: benvie: I still get http://pastie.org/3579498 randomly >.<
[18:44] sammmy: nevermind. Figured it out.
[18:44] Phoenixz: string.replace('foo', undefined); is, so far, no problem...
[18:44] benvie: oh so I think first off
[18:45] benvie: you need to have an actual client.on('error', logOrSomething)
[18:45] benvie: so it can propagate errors to you 
[18:45] Phoenixz: "foobar".replace('foo', undefined); gives me undefinedbar...
[18:45] ProjectMoon: Phoenixz: yeah
[18:45] benvie: and then you can get to what the actual error source is
[18:45] beakybal4: mmk ;3
[18:45] kevinswiber: sammmy: Define "all quirky."
[18:45] ProjectMoon: Phoenixz: are there different versions of node? maybe strict mode?

[18:48] beakybal4: <3
[18:48] beakybal4: brb
[18:48] ProjectMoon: Phoenixz: well, apparently strict mode doesn't matter for this case. it's enabled by "use strict"; at the top of a script
[18:48] ProjectMoon: Phoenixz: but replace does not throw that error in strict mode
[18:48] Vespakoen has joined the channel
[18:49] Phoenixz: ProjectMoon: is that not documented or something? Google gives nothing on that 
[18:49] ProjectMoon: Phoenixz: are you using String.prototype.replace.call/apply, or just str.replace('stuff', 'otherstuff'). ECMAScript strict mode is what you would google for
[18:49] Phoenixz: ProjectMoon: the error does not even make sense... It says that I used replace on an undefined or null variable.. But If a variable is null or undefined, it does not have replace() method..
[18:50] ProjectMoon: Phoenixz: yeah i know
[18:50] Phoenixz: ProjectMoon: Just string.replace (well, its object.otherobject.string.replace())
[18:50] ProjectMoon: Phoenixz: i reproduced it by calling it via prototype
[18:50] ProjectMoon: TypeError: String.prototype.replace called on null or undefined
[18:50] ProjectMoon: via String.prototype.replace.call(null, 'asdf', 'adsf');
[18:51] ProjectMoon: Phoenixz: maybe using a shim that overrides string replace and then calls it via prototype internally for some reason?

[19:26] Shelly: xml2js, xml2json, njst
[19:26] nicholasf: anyone done this?
[19:26] Shelly: whats wrong?
[19:26] ProjectMoon: Shelly: it means it is trying to call toString() on a reference that does not exist
[19:26] Shelly: node v0.6.12
[19:26] topfunky has joined the channel
[19:27] nicholasf: hey topaxi
[19:27] nicholasf: topfunky, rather
[19:27] Shelly: a know what it means...
[19:27] benvie: oh the toString error
[19:27] Shelly: a dont know why
[19:27] topfunky: nicholasf: Hey!
[19:27] benvie: it happens when you have objects witha null prototype
[19:27] benvie: because internally js is trying to call obj.toString
[19:27] nicholasf: topfunky: we met briefly when you were in Melbourne a while ago :)
[19:27] Shelly: benvie  hmm maybe
[19:27] Karmaon has joined the channel
[19:27] benvie: and since it has no prototyp and you didn't give a toString function
[19:27] Shelly: but i install via npm  xml2js
[19:27] topfunky: nicholasf: Cool. Great city.
[19:27] benvie: it has no path to victory
[19:27] Shelly: and run simple example
[19:28] benvie: Object.create(null)+''
[19:28] benvie: oh not of the error
[19:28] benvie: well that's the cause of it, one way or another
[19:28] benvie: as to where it's happening, that's the more specific problem
[19:28] benvie: but that's the cause of it

[19:29] ningu: if I have nginx sending requests to my node.js app, can I have nginx also gzip compress the node app's responses?
[19:29] tjholowaychuk: not sure why
[19:29] topfunky: also, I can't get mocha to run tests in subdirectories of "test". Is there a way?
[19:29] theCole has joined the channel
[19:29] tjholowaychuk: topfunky it just accepts a "dumb" list of files

[19:30] Shelly: benvie  what your vers of node?
[19:30] Shelly: u havve  anything from <Shelly> xml2js, xml2json, njst ?

[20:10] topfunky: deedubs: Did you try "npm rebuild" to recompile?
[20:11] Eruadan: I was reading yesterday that node for beginners book, and i realized what node really is. It's not about only js in the server or programming web applications, it's almost another paradigm. crazy stuff.
[20:11] deedubs: topfunky: yeah but it just seems awkward to have to ssh into the machine and rebuild the packages
[20:11] riverraid has joined the channel
[20:12] deedubs: topfunky: is it weird your IRC messages are in your voice in my head?
[20:12] ningu: Eruadan: well, basically node provides a library and environment so js can be used server side to do things other scripting languages do
[20:12] topfunky: deedubs: You could use a script: ssh me@machine.com "cd app && npm rebuild"
[20:12] topfunky: deedubs: heh
[20:12] CarterL: Eruadan: do you like that book?
[20:12] ningu: I don't know if it's really a new paradigm -- it's new for js, true
[20:13] whitman has joined the channel
[20:14] Eruadan: it's a new paradigm in a sense that you not going to make a forum with node, you want to make something that uses it's  capabilities
[20:14] Eruadan: CarterL, yes and no
[20:15] initohen\: the order of keys in objects is undefined in javascript, so does that mean that i can never count on http.request placing the supplied headers in the order i specify them?
[20:15] Eruadan: i like the general idea of the book, but i think he got lost a bit in the examples
[20:15] fomatin has joined the channel
[20:15] sechrist_: well the asynchronous stuff has been around as long as interactive UIs have
[20:15] joshontheweb has joined the channel
[20:15] sechrist_: but the syntax obviously is different
[20:16] CarterL: Eruadan: i see
[20:16] ningu: Eruadan: I don't know, I like js and what node offers so I'm liable to code up a simple site with it too, but I take your point
[20:16] tmike: initohen\: the spec doesn't define it, but the major engines implement keys with insertion order
[20:16] initohen: i guess it's more a question of "have they stated an intent"
[20:16] initohen: because it's bad form to rely on something that may change in the future :)
[20:16] tmike: I read somewhere today that they're looking to spec it AS order of insertion in ES6
[20:17] initohen: nice
[20:17] initohen: hopefully so!
[20:17] tmike: don't take my word for it though
[20:17] ningu: initohen: no, it's not undefined, is it? I thought collection order was predictable based on what order the keys had been added
[20:17] initohen: anyway, all i have to do is not upgrade node for a while
[20:17] ningu: initohen: but if you mean in a browser I wouldn't rely on that
[20:17] ProjectMoon: ningu: it is undefined
[20:17] redir has joined the channel
[20:17] sechrist has joined the channel

[20:18] ningu: ProjectMoon: that's not the  same
[20:18] Eruadan: ningu, that is cool, it probably let's you get a lot of experience with it.
[20:18] ningu: for ... in is not guaranteed to be in any order
[20:18] ningu: which doesn't mean there is no order
[20:18] mandric has joined the channel
[20:19] ProjectMoon: ningu: well how else would you iterate over them with the base language (e.g. no iterator provided by the library/framework)?
[20:19] initohen: grr, any of you familiar with coffeescript?
[20:19] ProjectMoon: guess you could use Object.keys
[20:19] ProjectMoon: but i don't know if that produces the keys in any specific order
[20:19] initohen: i'm just trying to remove null keys from an object but :\
[20:19] yaymukund: initohen: a bit, but see #coffeescript
[20:20] initohen: nobody answered in there :)
[20:20] yaymukund: oh
[20:20] Eruadan: but what i meant, is that now i don't see ror and php being replaced by node. most things on the web do not need such power, just sayin....
[20:20] initohen: google is being hard to search for this term too
[20:20] initohen: i see that delete is what i want, but it doesn't seem to work according to the demo code on the site
[20:20] JmZ has joined the channel
[20:21] ningu: ProjectMoon: I'm not sure, actually, but I use several things where the code is sensitive to the order
[20:21] yaymukund: initohen: delete works for me in coffee -i. can you send a gist?
[20:22] initohen: is there something wrong with 'delete @foo[key] for key in @foo' ?
[20:22] initohen: er, besides it deleting everything haha
[20:22] sechrist: if order is important and it's a linear increment, i++ has always kept my loops in order :)
[20:22] sechrist: and using the index
[20:22] soapyillusions has joined the channel
[20:22] ProjectMoon: sechrist: i think this is for things that are not integer indices
[20:22] sechrist: and if it's a dictionary I usually just use object.keys()
[20:23] sechrist: but the order there might be unpleasant
[20:23] zanes has joined the channel
[20:23] ProjectMoon: initohen: that should work. what about it is not working?
[20:23] initohen: i put console.log(@foo) and the object printed still contains the null keys
[20:23] initohen: (when @foo[key] is null)
[20:24] yaymukund: initohen: it deletes all the others?
[20:24] initohen: nope
[20:24] yaymukund: initohen: (the non-nulls)
[20:24] yaymukund: initohen: yeah. it doesnt delete any of em if I run it in coffee -i
[20:24] initohen: :|
[20:24] ProjectMoon: well what does it do
[20:24] ProjectMoon: when you print instead
[20:24] ProjectMoon: is it actually hitting all the keys?
[20:24] initohen: prints the unaltered object apparently
[20:24] ProjectMoon: well i mean print each key
[20:25] ProjectMoon: if it prints all the keys (including null values) it should delete them all too
[20:25] ProjectMoon: welll
[20:25] ProjectMoon: you are deleting the values
[20:25] initohen: ha, you're correct
[20:25] CarlosC has joined the channel
[20:25] initohen: it doesn't loop it at all

[21:18] spacesuit has joined the channel
[21:19] PPaul: you can do this without prototypes and save yourself headaches
[21:19] PPaul: make a factory function
[21:19] PPaul: you want to eval shit now?
[21:19] PPaul: you can eval, though
[21:20] PPaul: factory function pattern is better IMO
[21:20] PPaul: easier to TEST too
[21:20] PPaul: TEST TEST TEST
[21:20] gzmask: PPaul: but still needs to be eval right?
[21:20] PPaul: yes
[21:20] PPaul: unless you want to code your own eval?

[21:35] gzmask: PPaul: I can see why you are against prototype. but I am using a second level of prototype to make the first level prototype untouchable, but yeah, users can still prototype on prototype thus I 'll need massive regular expression in my program. Might be good to give up prototype

[21:38] iangreenleaf: Yeah, I can handle this with a little more effort on my part, was just hoping there was a good way I could do it all at one level of async.
[21:39] caolanm: iangreenleaf: don't try to be too clever, break things up into smaller parts
[21:39] konobi: caolanm: any luck on that parallel feature?
[21:39] mikeal: daleharvey: it's broken now
[21:39] caolanm: konobi: no, I should really do that
[21:39] mikeal: if you make it pass more tests, i'll take a pull req
[21:39] daleharvey: mikeal: it works!
[21:40] mikeal: ok, then i'll definitely take the pull req :)
[21:40] benvie: Daegalus: yeah I am
[21:40] daleharvey: heh, there is a few of them
[21:40] ningu: caolanm: does parallel just do everything all at once immediately (more or less) or is there an attempt at balancing simultaneous actions?
[21:40] benvie: Daegalus: I've been talking stuff like a brick at a time
[21:41] k1ttty has joined the channel
[21:41] caolanm: ningu: everything at once
[21:41] benvie: Daegalus: I'm working on updating node-ffi to use a more workable foundation for marshalling data to and from C
[21:41] caolanm: ningu: konobi was just asking about a feature to limit how many parallel operations it performs
[21:41] ningu: ah, ok -- that's what I was wondering
[21:42] ningu: and forEach is parallel, right? so if I have 1000 db entries and do forEach and save each one, that would be a big hit
[21:42] daleharvey: mikeal: 54 commits pull requested :P
[21:42] caolanm: ningu: there's forEachLimit which works in parallel but with a concurrency limit
[21:42] Daegalus: benvie: thats awesome. I wish I could help, but I am not that good with C or bindings. But I am of great support to what you are doing. It sounds amazing
[21:42] benvie: Daegalus: which is the foundation for bindings to CEF or Chromium content client, both of which are relatively complex things because they involve a lot of complex entities
[21:42] ningu: ah, right
[21:42] ningu: I just didn't think about it till now so I didn't check the docs yet
[21:42] lmorchard has joined the channel
[21:42] mikeal: damn
[21:42] mikeal: you went to town :)
[21:43] caolanm: ningu: I intend to add a generic way to manage the number of parallel operations for any function working in parallel soon
[21:43] ningu: cool
[21:43] daleharvey: some of them may offend you, sorry :P
[21:43] ningu: my usage isn't heavy enough to matters, but it's something I've wondered
[21:43] ningu: to matter*
[21:43] benvie: Daegalus: that work is happening here https://github.com/Benvie/reified
[21:43] caolanm: daleharvey: you using pouchdb for something?
[21:43] ningu: since I don't really know how mongo reacts to things like that
[21:43] benvie: Daegalus: I'm getting close to where I want it to be and then I'm going to move up to the next brick
[21:43] daleharvey: caolanm: planning to, when its working
[21:44] caolanm: daleharvey: I've had some ideas recently that might make use of it too, glad to see you're taking on the baton
[21:44] Daegalus: benvie: thanks for the link, I will keep an eye on it. Ive been following the Tide transition group, and all the conversation there is getting me excited for various project ideas
[21:45] ningu: hrm... pouchdb is a couchdb-like database stored client-side?
[21:45] Sadin has joined the channel
[21:45] mikeal: daleharvey: merged
[21:45] benvie: yeah the thing with them is they have an existing base to work from
[21:45] mikeal: daleharvey: did you see couchie?
[21:45] benvie: so I think they're kind of hamstrung in how big a movement can be made to smoething liek this
[21:45] Sadin: guys can anyone tell me what im doign wrong when trying to run a new express app https://gist.github.com/d7dc198add7db11501d6
[21:45] daleharvey: sweet, thanks
[21:45] caolanm: mikeal: you still working on couchapps as browser extensions?
[21:45] benvie: so I plan to continue working on my thing as I have until i at least get a baseline to build a real platform on top o
[21:46] larsschenk1 has left the channel
[21:46] jeffbcross has joined the channel
[21:46] benvie: maybe that would be something to build the next iteration ofe Tide on, depending how fast they move and how long it takes me to figure it out
[21:46] daleharvey: mikeal: nah, thats kinda what I wanted, then I figured out I would prefer a full couch that replicates
[21:46] robi42 has joined the channel
[21:46] mikeal: we're using couchie in our app as a cache
[21:46] lohkey has joined the channel
[21:46] ningu: Sadin: did you specify a host to bind to as well as a port in listen()?
[21:47] mikeal: we actually don't want full replication, we only want to hold the latest stuff by your current location
[21:47] Sadin: ningu ummm one sec let me show you my app.js file
[21:47] ningu: that would help
[21:47] mikeal: caolanm: not right now, max was a little but instead went really deep in to node
[21:47] mikeal: fronting couchapps with node to extend them
[21:48] daleharvey: mobile futon did something similiar, not quite as much but I just memoised anything that couch returned 
[21:48] Sadin: ningu https://gist.github.com/2024927
[21:48] caolanm: mikeal: right, thats the rewriter project max has on github
[21:49] augustl: I have a path to a npm package. Are there APIs in node or npm to get all the dependencies from that package?
[21:49] augustl: something a bit more future proof than fs.readFile on package.json and manual traversal would rock :)
[21:49] isaacs: augustl: require("pkg-name/package.json")
[21:50] ningu: Sadin: app.address() must be not populated yet for some reason
[21:50] ningu: Sadin: just pass the port directly to console.log()

[21:54] augustl: allright, tnx
[21:54] isaacs: augustl: but you could do fs.readdir() on its nodE_modules folder, and require() each package.json from there
[21:54] Eruadan has joined the channel
[21:54] kevwil has joined the channel
[21:54] isaacs: augustl: or glob("**/node_modules/*/package.json", function (er, files) { files.forEach(require(

[21:57] MrTopf has joined the channel
[21:57] isaacs: augustl: kewl
[21:57] augustl: ningu: any number of subfolders
[21:57] isaacs: ningu: where "0" is a number :)
[21:57] augustl: dependencies, devDependencies and optionalDependencies - that'
[21:57] isaacs: ningu: so **/foo.js matches ./foo.js
[21:57] augustl: that's all of them?
[21:57] isaacs: augustl: for now, yeah :)
[21:57] augustl: allright
[21:57] daniel` has joined the channel
[21:57] isaacs: augustl: optionalDependencies are kind of an interesting one.
[21:57] isaacs: augustl: what's your use case for doing this?
[21:58] augustl: isaacs: I'm writing a developer util for devs of busterjs.org (the project not the website)
[21:58] isaacs: interesting
[21:58] jeffbcross has left the channel
[21:58] ningu: isaacs: yeah, was just reading the docs, although I wouldn't have quite realized that :)
[21:58] augustl: it consists of 20 or so packages. So I'm writing an util that reads the package.json for all of the buster projects, reads out the deps, and "npm install"-s deps that aren't buster packages
[21:59] joshsmith has joined the channel
[21:59] augustl: then I add the folder with all the buster projects to NODE_PATH
[21:59] augustl: and the bin folder of the top level project, "buster", to PATH
[21:59] augustl: hopefully it'll work fine :)
[22:01] augustl: does https://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/doc/api/install.md take version numbers, or just package names?
[22:01] mikeal: daleharvey: i think touchdb and couchbase are redefining the replication semantics a bit
[22:01] mikeal: like, in a good way tho
[22:01] isaacs: augustl: it takes whatever npm takes.
[22:01] isaacs: augustl: so, pkgname, pkgname@version-number, pkgname@tag, pkgname@git-or-http-url, git-or-http-url, etc.
[22:01] augustl: isaacs: ah
[22:02] mikeal: far too much of Apache CouchDB's internals have crept in to the replication semantics
[22:02] ningu: isaacs: do you happen to know if there's anything like semver for ruby?
[22:02] augustl: I now have an object of all the dependencies in the form of {"foo": "1.2.3"} and so on, I guess I need to transform that manually?
[22:02] dambalah has joined the channel
[22:02] augustl: seems simple enough though, key + "@" + value

[22:02] isaacs: ningu: i don't know, no
[22:02] isaacs: ningu: but i imagine there is something like it.
[22:02] daleharvey: I know theres a few changes, like if you create 2 identical documents and replicate, they will conflict in touchdb but not in apache
[22:03] kevwil has joined the channel
[22:03] isaacs: ningu: i mean, rubygems and bundler do it *somehow*
[22:03] ningu: isaacs: because homebrew on os x is braindead about version comparisons, it seems... I thought I might go bug them to use whatever it is :)
[22:03] ningu: `brew outdated` for me returns: perl (5.14.2 < 5.14.1)
[22:04] daleharvey: I dont think they are dramatically changed in touchdb, couchbase is entirely different though

[22:54] Eruadan: CarterL, i like very much the beginning, when he refactor the server file and explains how node works with the callback function. I think the rest is ok, but when he is in the midlle of the examples. not sure where exactly, he looses a bit the thinking and he has too much  assumptions in my view, about the background of the reader, if he is experienced or not , or if he knows php, ruby or etc...
[22:54] Eruadan: he could follow the refactor example, the whole book..more direct
[22:55] CarterL: yes, i recall that portion
[22:55] Eruadan: do you understand me?
[22:55] Eruadan: mm, k
[22:56] Eruadan: but it's a very good start
[22:56] CarterL: i have done some php and played around with RoR/django a few years ago, so its not completely foreign
[22:57] Eruadan: me too, i can read php and ruby a bit, altough the language i really know, is javascript(i've been studying), so i like very much the first of book, with the code refactoring example
[22:57] CarterL: what do you recommend after this one?
[22:58] Eruadan: nonot sure, i would had to rethink about it

[23:15] slug_: has anyone brought the directfb v8 bindings into node? I google and searched github, but nothing showed up
[23:15] Eruadan: i think this is my true vocation, a researcher, i can spend hours researching ...
[23:15] CarterL: :) same!
[23:16] isaacs: tedsuo: that's on the search page, actually
[23:16] Eruadan: hehe, by i knew derby you don't ;p

[23:17] Eruadan: true, that's far to many modules to evaluate still, i just checked the frameworks o.O
[23:17] Eruadan: there is far*
[23:17] Eruadan: too*
[23:17] tedsuo: isaacs: nice!
[23:18] initohen: wtf
[23:19] initohen: i just got done reading a big blog about how 'deflate' as a content-encoding was goofed up (raw data vs zlib header'd)
[23:19] initohen: and that gzip was preferred because it didn't have that problem
[23:19] relling has joined the channel
[23:19] initohen: but apparently google is sending headerless gzipped data?
[23:20] ningu: derby looks quite interesting
