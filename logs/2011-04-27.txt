[00:07] cloudhea1: don't see what else it could be
[00:07] mikeal: hey
[00:07] mikeal: webapp
[00:07] mikeal: questions
[00:07] mikeal: we're actually really in to this
[00:07] mikeal: we were considering doing some proof of concept stuff like this
[00:07] creationix: cool
[00:07] mikeal: in the TODO
[00:07] tjholowaychuk has joined the channel
[00:07] creationix: you also saw node-gir I started the other day?
[00:07] dguttman has joined the channel
[00:08] mikeal: i think it would be ideal to replace jsc with v8
[00:08] creationix: mikeal: so it could share contexts?
[00:08] mikeal: and have it pull contexts out of the v8 process you start the webkit from
[00:09] creationix: yeah, that would be pretty cool
[00:09] mikeal: so like, you're starting node and creating a webkit view
[00:09] creationix: yep
[00:09] mikeal: that webkit view should just get contexts out of the v8 you start it from
[00:09] mikeal: and have a nice module that you could call from the node server end that iterates over the contexts
[00:09] mikeal: and maybe even have events when new ones are created
[00:10] creationix: mikeal: sounds good
[00:10] mikeal: but you were a little hesitant
[00:10] creationix: I guess that's plenty secure since the browser contexts can't see the main node context
[00:10] mikeal: and i was wondering why
[00:11] creationix: the danger is in practice
[00:11] mikeal: even if you want to expose everything to the contexts in webkit, you can make it all copy on write
[00:11] creationix: once the node context interacts with references from a browser context, there could be handles to go up to node
[00:11] Aria has joined the channel
[00:12] creationix: yeah, it's not hard to solve if you're careful, I was just worried about people who don't understand the security issues and making mistakes
[00:12] jakehow has joined the channel
[00:12] kmduke has joined the channel
[00:12] mikeal: hrm....
[00:12] mikeal: i think, if you just write it without considering security
[00:13] mikeal: the app platform that gets built on top of this
[00:13] mikeal: could just disable remote script
[00:13] creationix: so, for example, I want to attach a callback to the onclick of a button that does something in node space
[00:13] mikeal: so all the script would have to be written by the app author
[00:13] mikeal: then it's not really an issue
[00:13] saikat has joined the channel
[00:13] mikeal: that's fine, i mean you kind of want that, desktop app developers get access to filesystem/sockets/etc 
[00:13] mikeal: that's pretty much normal
[00:14] creationix: right, but what if they put a link to some external webpage
[00:14] mikeal: the real concern is throwing a script tag that pulls from the internet in there
[00:14] creationix: and that page has a link to some third-party site
[00:14] creationix: I guess it wouldn't be hard to restrict the domain and keep it from changing
[00:14] mikeal: or
[00:14] mikeal: when webkit views get created
[00:14] mikeal: and need a js context, check the domain
[00:15] mikeal: you know it at that point
[00:15] mikeal: if it's a remote url, it doesn't get access to node
[00:15] creationix: ok, so iframes would get a vanilla context
[00:15] creationix: that should work as long as cross-domain restrictions are working
[00:15] colinclark has joined the channel
[00:16] techwraith: creationix, mikeal: this sounds fun, what are we talking about?
[00:16] creationix: techwraith: https://github.com/creationix/webapp
[00:16] mikeal: creationix: i think all browsers disable cross-domain to a file:// url
[00:16] creationix: mikeal: well, that's not a safe assumption
[00:16] creationix: webkit is very flexible
[00:16] mikeal: i bet webkit is already locked down in that regard
[00:16] mikeal: if it isn't already, i'm sure we can make it
[00:17] creationix: right, just need to remember to check
[00:17] creationix: this is actually a *lot* like our app environment in webOS
[00:17] mikeal: except you don't have node.js in the same context :)
[00:17] creationix: right, but we have other private JS apis
[00:18] mikeal: yup
[00:18] creationix: the browser app is written in javascript, and it renders third-party pages

[00:19] creationix: mikeal: so, what's your use case?  I want to make desktop apps using node.
[00:19] mikeal: same
[00:20] mikeal: we have desktop clients in Air
[00:20] mikeal: and it's painful
[00:20] mikeal: and we can't really fix it
[00:20] mikeal: most of our code is javascript, not actually actionscript
[00:20] mikeal: so a transition to another webkit thing would be doable
[00:20] mikeal: if it wasn't for all the fiddly bits
[00:21] tjholowaychuk: mikeal: ooo air :( that sucks
[00:21] mdaisuke has joined the channel
[00:21] tjholowaychuk: feel your pain
[00:21] creationix: mikeal: do you care about cross-platform deployment of the desktop apps?
[00:21] mikeal: as bad as it is, it's the farthest along of cross-platform desktop app frameworks
[00:21] mikeal: creationix: yes
[00:21] creationix: same here
[00:21] mikeal: air is basically a really shitty webkit binding to their terrible actionscript vm
[00:21] creationix: right now I'm using webkitGTK, but I don't care what is used as long as it's easy to bundle
[00:22] mikeal: with some native additions to HTML that don't actually work and break scrolling
[00:22] creationix: webkitgtk was easy to bind to on ubuntu, I've never written a node binding before

[00:23] creationix: mikeal: well, if you guys have any resources to help that would be great.  Our webkit guys are swamped and this isn't high priority yet so it's just me in my free time.
[00:23] mikeal: i don't even know where to start with trying to compile this
[00:23] creationix: you want to test it?
[00:23] mikeal: yeah
[00:23] mikeal: on mac
[00:23] creationix: node-waf configure build
[00:24] creationix: but you need lots of gtk headers
[00:24] creationix: it would be hard
[00:24] creationix: maybe it would be best to have multiple bindings, one for each platform
[00:24] creationix: I head cocoa's webkit is easy to bind to
[00:24] mikeal: what would it take to get off of that and on just webkit
[00:24] creationix: *hear
[00:24] Hoopi has joined the channel
[00:24] Hoopi: Hello
[00:24] creationix: the problem is that vanilla webkit doesn't have a painter or a window system

[00:25] creationix: qt might be easier than gtk, it's got a cross-platform painter
[00:25] techwraith: mikeal: If I have some time around then, I'd like to sit in
[00:25] mikeal: i think we'rd rather bind to native
[00:26] mikeal: techwraith: i think we're doing it in the east bay, working from a coffee shop in our neighborhood tomorrow
[00:26] creationix: webkitgtk is standard in gnome these days, cocoa has webkit built-in too
[00:26] techwraith: ah, nvm
[00:26] creationix: not sure about windows
[00:26] jmorris: can someone tell me why config never gets set to data? http://pastie.org/1837388
[00:26] mikeal: binding to native means that we can have a project in the native env to build out the chrome around the webkit view
[00:27] mikeal: which i think is preferable 
[00:27] Hoopi: can someone help me? I'm trying to run a script which requires some file not included in the repository on github, so i commented it out and now i get: DEBUG: Listening on 6000 
[00:27] creationix: mikeal: oh, so making our own mini gtk or qt that just implements the window?
[00:27] ChrisPartridge: jmorris: Because your function is returning before the callback completes
[00:28] creationix: titanium and chromium would be good sources of inspiration I think
[00:28] jmorris: ChrisPartridge: ok, tank you :)
[00:28] mikeal: titanium does some funky shit
[00:28] gavin_huang has joined the channel
[00:28] mikeal: chrome might be good tho
[00:28] creationix: funky, yes, but it does bind to native I believe
[00:28] Hoopi: can anyone help?
[00:29] mikeal: they have a layer between what you write and what they do in nativ
[00:29] mikeal: Chrome probably just has raw native code the implements a consistent UI

[00:29] xeodox has left the channel
[00:30] creationix: mikeal: so we're talking xlib, win32, and cocoa?
[00:30] creationix: hmm, or maybe clutter instead of xlib
[00:30] mikeal: i don't have an opinion on xlib
[00:30] EyePulp has joined the channel
[00:30] mikeal: for linux i think we could pick gtk or qt or something same
[00:30] mikeal: er sane
[00:30] creationix: the problem is webkit doesn't even have a rasterizer, you would have to implement all that
[00:31] mikeal: that's the part we can generalize
[00:31] jmorris: ChrisPartridge: i'm having a hard time thinking of how i would assign data to config :/
[00:31] mikeal: i mean, if we don't do this, there isn't much added that you can't get with titanium or air or something like that

[00:45] jcohen: That'd be impossible to support w/ Zombie due to the fact that there are no synchronous http methods exposed, right?

[00:50] ParadoxQuine has joined the channel

[01:01] schloerke has joined the channel
[01:02] Vekz has joined the channel
[01:02] kriskowal: although there are a variety of ways to join multiple callbacks into a single eventual callback, but you'll need to think about error propagation and all that
[01:03] qbert: this is just what I wanted actually
[01:03] qbert: but I'd like to know how to do it myself - is it easy to explain how do join multiple callbacks into a single one ?
[01:04] Vekz: If i'm launching multiple commands through child_process.exec(); Are they all executed in the same environment? e.x. child_process.exec("rvm use 1.2.9@demo; rails c;"); would that rails process be in the same environment as the rvm?
[01:04] qbert: I mean I'll use the library but id like to know how its done :)
[01:04] Emmanuel__ has joined the channel
[01:04] techwraith: Vekz: yes
[01:04] kriskowal: there are a variety of quick hacks, like having a callback you give to all of your calls that counts all of the calls and forwards the results to a single callback when the counter drops to zero
[01:05] techwraith: Vekz: However, I'm not sure if they would be if they were in two different exec calls.
[01:05] kriskowal: qbert: or calling the eventual callback with an error at the first time your accumulator callback gets an error
[01:05] Aria: What do you mean 'environment'?
[01:06] kriskowal: qbert: but Q does it a bit differently, where each "promise" is either in a resolved or unresolved state and queues up a bunch of "messages" like event listener requests until the promise is in the resolved state.
[01:06] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[01:07] techwraith: Aria: I was assuming this: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Guide_to_Unix/Environment_Variables
[01:07] kriskowal: qbert: so an unresolved promise contains an array of messages, like "when this is resolved, call me"
[01:07] Vekz: yes unix Environment variables
[01:07] mynyml has joined the channel
[01:08] Aria: Ah. Yes, assuming your shell doesn't change them ;-)
[01:08] kriskowal: qbert: and when it's resolved, and when messages are sent to the promise after it's been resolved, they get sent to the next promise down the line, ultimately to a promise that interacts with the "fulfilled" value for you
[01:08] Aria: Environment variables are inherited by copying into each subprocess.
[01:08] Aria: So node's get copied into the shell's in the command1;command2 case, then the shell's copied into each subprocess's.
[01:08] kriskowal: qbert: it's this message forwarding that allows exceptions to propagate without explicit error code in every callback
[01:09] demastrie has joined the channel
[01:09] qbert: kriskowal,  nice!
[01:09] Vekz:  I am able to display successful output from the rvm command using child_process.stdout but then I get error output from the rails command stating that its missing the rvm stuff as if they are not being sharked
[01:09] kriskowal: qbert: also has some neat properties if you're using promises in other workers over long round trip network connections. you can queue up a bunch of messages to a promise before its fulfilled so the remote object can respond to them quickly
[01:09] Vekz: shared* not sharked lol
[01:10] kriskowal: qbert: that's https://github.com/kriskowal/q-comm in a nutshell. promise piplining
[01:10] jcohen has left the channel
[01:10] techwraith: Aria, right, but in the exec('command1'); exec('command2') case, if you set a variable in command 1, you can't use it in command 2, right?
[01:10] kriskowal: which admittedly has some structural issues that cropped up when NPM changed
[01:11] kriskowal: qbert: in any case, send me a message on github when you've got more questions.
[01:12] dguttman has joined the channel
[01:15] qbert: kriskowal,  will do, I'll be using this heavliy for something I'm working that contains a bunch of asynch tasks
[01:15] JusticeFries has joined the channel
[01:17] Aria: techwraith: Right. But nor can you neccesarily in the multi-command case. If you're using a shell, yes, it'll be set above command1 and command2; if you set it /in/ command1, no, command2 won't see it.
[01:18] Aria: export foo=bar; command1; command2 -- both see it. foo=bar command1; command2 -- only command1 sees it. And env foo=bar command1; command2 -- no, only command1 sees it.
[01:19] abraxas has joined the channel
[01:20] Vekz: Aria: that might be the problem i'm seeing
[01:21] Aria: Or, set it in _node's_ environment, and then they ALL see it.

[02:05] hunterloftis: (which is a nicely simple interface)
[02:06] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: mongodb-native is what mongoose uses behind the scenes

[02:06] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: Yeah I saw that, but didn't think I'd enjoy working with it
[02:06] tjholowaychuk: its almost like a machine generated port or something haha

[02:25] qbert_: hunterloftis, just fyi I use mongolian also it's perfect for what we need, we couldnt use mongoose because of the schema registering
[02:26] Tobsn: BAM!
[02:26] mscdex: :P
[02:26] qbert_: BOOM!
[02:26] hunterloftis: qbert_: you have no schema or you just preferred the simplicity?
[02:26] no-gooder: cbiscardi, like this : http://markmail.org/message/de2zjj3cje7xbait#query:+page:1+mid:l32nz75qozdh45jj+state:results
[02:26] qbert_: hunterloftis, yeah the schema is dynamic , also the simplicity is nice
[02:26] cbiscardi: no-gooder: node won't start processing the next request until it's done with the first. you are keeping it "open" by not ending the request. essentially blocking the server.
[02:27] mischief has joined the channel
[02:27] hunterloftis: qbert_: ok cool thanks for the input; I'm trying to decide between the two right now.
[02:27] shaun: mscdex?
[02:27] cbiscardi: no-gooder: it's not a pool of connections that can be handled like i believe you're trying to do.
[02:27] mscdex: shaun: yeah?
[02:27] shaun: hehe? haha
[02:27] shaun: ^_^
[02:27] hunterloftis: qbert_: I'd go straight for mongolian except I know mongoose has been out longer/tested more/used more
[02:27] mscdex: :-D
[02:28] qbert_: hunterloftis, yep exactly, mongolian is still changing , something to consider
[02:28] Tobsn: damint
[02:28] Tobsn: that was my next mov
[02:28] Tobsn: e
[02:28] Tobsn: wtf!
[02:28] cbiscardi: no-gooder: it will, however, be able to handle the two seperate requests if you let it stop processing instead of removing res.end and you will get them to happen like you want
[02:28] hunterloftis: qbert_: have you run into any nasty surprises? Things that are clearly wrong?
[02:29] arpegius has joined the channel
[02:29] qbert_: hunterloftis, no the code itself looks really clean, mostly its lack of things, DBRef is not really exposed except for in trunk, and currently I have a need for eval() which isn't exposed yet
[02:30] hunterloftis: qbert_: ok cool thanks
[02:31] hunterloftis: qbert_: my data structures aren't so complicated that I'd need refs, this is a super simple CRUD style project
[02:31] Tobsn: AND DONE
[02:31] Tobsn: haha
[02:31] mscdex: ha
[02:31] Tobsn: that that BIATCH
[02:31] Tobsn: :P
[02:31] mscdex: well, i spotted a couple errors that need fixing, so i'm taking the server down for now
[02:31] mscdex: :)
[02:31] Tobsn: yep
[02:32] Tobsn: i layed down two cards at once
[02:32] Tobsn: due to fast clicking
[02:32] mscdex: hmm...
[02:32] Tobsn: you have to check if you lock directly after a valid move to the stack
[02:33] Tobsn: the UI sucks somehow too
[02:33] Tobsn: but its definitly a nice game :D
[02:33] mscdex: yeah i know, i don't claim to be a frontend developer
[02:33] shaunau: i think i might need a more uniqe handle..
[02:33] mscdex: ;)
[02:33] Tobsn: and im not easly pleased :P
[02:33] Tobsn: did you came up with the game?
[02:33] Tobsn: hehe just kidding.
[02:33] mscdex: the web frontend has taken the longest part of the whole thing
[02:34] mscdex: there's an irc frontend too :P
[02:34] Tobsn: lets spread the rumor PSN used ruby, whos with me?
[02:34] mscdex: so people on irc can play with web users too
[02:34] Tobsn: haha

[02:44] Tobsn: stylus of course
[02:44] dguttman_ has joined the channel
[02:44] EvanCarroll: is this agreed upon?
[02:44] kmiyashiro: I prefer sass/compass
[02:44] tjholowaychuk: EvanCarroll: sass isnt much of a choice for node stuff
[02:44] EvanCarroll: I'm new to the idea of css processors
[02:45] tjholowaychuk: kmiyashiro: compass sucks :p but yeah stylus is really new
[02:45] devrim has joined the channel
[02:45] kmiyashiro: meh
[02:45] kmiyashiro: does the things I want with minimal cognitive friction
[02:45] EvanCarroll: ok, I got 2 for stylus
[02:45] EvanCarroll: give me one more!
[02:45] EvanCarroll: SOMEONE SAY STYLUS > *
[02:45] gkatsev: does stylus have functions?
[02:45] tjholowaychuk: gkatsev: haha yes
[02:45] tjholowaychuk: before sass did
[02:45] tjholowaychuk: 0.0.1
[02:45] tjholowaychuk: had functions
[02:45] aho: well, sass doesn't run on node... so there
[02:46] kmiyashiro: tjholowaychuk: have you used the beta of compass?
[02:46] gkatsev: hehe, ok.
[02:46] tjholowaychuk: kmiyashiro: yeah
[02:46] kmiyashiro: pretty sweet
[02:46] tjholowaychuk: meh
[02:46] tjholowaychuk: sass is lacking a lot
[02:46] gkatsev: tjholowaychuk: good to know. Does it pretty much have feature parity with sass?
[02:46] tjholowaychuk: stylus just needs to mature
[02:46] Tobsn: i like stylus cause it gives you more than you need
[02:46] EvanCarroll: someone speak up.
[02:46] kmiyashiro: stylus chokes on a lot more stuff than sass/compass
[02:46] tjholowaychuk: gkatsev: has more features, missing a few that sass has, and has many that sass does not
[02:47] tjholowaychuk: gkatsev: but it's newer of course
[02:47] tjholowaychuk: by like 5 years
[02:47] kmiyashiro: I don't want to worry about that stuff
[02:47] tjholowaychuk: kmiyashiro: yeah if you write really messed up css
[02:47] Tobsn: EvanCarroll, you could also just write cSS
[02:47] Tobsn: CSS
[02:47] kmiyashiro: like the html5boilerplate?
[02:47] EvanCarroll: yea, I could. but, I've done that. I have no idea why I event want CSS processing. I just want to try it out
[02:48] tbranyen: css is too hard, i'm giving up
[02:48] tbranyen: flash 4 lyfe
[02:48] EvanCarroll: I've done professional web dev for quite some time, and never used a css processor. I'm kind of anxious to try one out, now that I'm playing with node/express/jade
[02:48] tjholowaychuk: EvanCarroll: because you can have vendor support and gradient images for IE generated with a single property :D
[02:48] gavin_huang has joined the channel
[02:48] tjholowaychuk: thats why
[02:48] gkatsev: tjholowaychuk: ok, cool. Haven't really used any of those. Have seen more of sass/less, though. But yeah, probably going to use stylus if I need anything like that. node ftw
[02:48] michaelrice has joined the channel
[02:48] tjholowaychuk: gkatsev: less has the least features, unless you want to run in the browser
[02:48] tjholowaychuk: not much point
[02:48] EvanCarroll: tjholowaychuk: I don't have to support hitty old browsers
[02:48] EvanCarroll: so I can do it with html5
[02:48] tjholowaychuk: EvanCarroll: still, dont enable the image support
[02:49] tbranyen: EvanCarroll: how does html5 help with vendor prefixes...
[02:49] tjholowaychuk: it will generate webkit/moz gradients etc
[02:49] gkatsev: tjholowaychuk: yeah, I think that's the only reason for using less. To not bother precompiling stuff.
[02:49] hasenj has joined the channel
[02:49] tjholowaychuk: gkatsev: well you still have to compile it
[02:49] tjholowaychuk: id never have the client do that
[02:49] EvanCarroll: I assume you're talking about the ie/box trickery to get to the rounded corners?
[02:49] Tobsn: professional web dev
[02:49] tjholowaychuk: EvanCarroll: no no, gradients
[02:49] kmiyashiro: I think there were three things I had to escape in the html5boilerplate stylesheet for stylus
[02:49] tbranyen: considering html5 doesn't have anything to do with css
[02:50] kmiyashiro: and it was almost impossible to tell what was causing it
[02:50] tjholowaychuk: EvanCarroll: http://www.screenr.com/M6a
[02:50] EvanCarroll: right, as in -- all html5 browsers support css2 fully and most of css3
[02:50] gkatsev: tbranyen: the marketing term html5 includes css3. Actual html5 does not. :P
[02:50] tbranyen: and how
[02:50] tjholowaychuk: kmiyashiro: yeah the error reporting is fucked up right now
[02:50] EvanCarroll: gkatsev++

[02:52] gtramont1na: hey tjholowaychuk: does Stylus provide any help when dealing with image sprites?
[02:52] kmiyashiro: what about express?

[02:52] tjholowaychuk: kmiyashiro: just me as well
[02:52] asdfsafdsa: are there any guides/modules to help create an mmorpg with node?
[02:52] mikeal has joined the channel
[02:52] tjholowaychuk: kmiyashiro: with the odd patch
[02:53] kmiyashiro: you must be busy
[02:53] gkatsev: someone should write a stylus script that enables all the weird CSS stuff across vendors. I know nettuts has a less script that does it. So, you can say like border(5 5 5 5) and it autogenerates the things for all vendors
[02:53] tjholowaychuk: haha yeah i have like 80 projects or something
[02:53] kmiyashiro: gkatsev: that's exactly what stylus does
[02:53] kmiyashiro: and sass/compass
[02:53] gkatsev: oh, does it do that by default?
[02:53] gkatsev: hm...
[02:53] tjholowaychuk: gkatsev: yeah thats what it's for
[02:54] tjholowaychuk: not by default
[02:54] gkatsev: ACTION should reall read up on all this awesome
[02:54] tjholowaychuk: the language us separate from stuff like that
[02:54] tjholowaychuk: is*
[02:54] tjholowaychuk: but stylus has far more power in terms of transparent support for stuff like that
[02:54] tjholowaychuk: sass/less etc
[02:54] gkatsev: ah, but you can enable something like that which is built-in? sweet.
[02:54] tjholowaychuk: have stuff like @include border-radius(rawr,rawr)
[02:54] kmiyashiro: I'd recommend learning all that shit and working with it until you know it by heart, then use these css processing things
[02:54] brianloveswords has joined the channel
[02:55] tjholowaychuk: and the compass gradient stuff is really weak
[02:55] kmiyashiro: how so?
[02:55] kmiyashiro: I think the beta improved its usage
[02:55] tjholowaychuk: the syntax blows, its locked to the background prop etc
[02:56] tjholowaychuk: with nib you just do "background-image: linear-gradient(top, white, black)" etc
[02:56] EvanCarroll: tjholowaychuk: it would be nifty if it could be set to work with a jQueryUI's css color schemes.
[02:56] tjholowaychuk: doesnt matter which property
[02:56] tjholowaychuk: it has knowledge of the values adjacent to it and the property it's called against

[02:57] tjholowaychuk: anything that can have a background image
[02:57] tjholowaychuk: can have a gradient

[02:57] tjholowaychuk: im just saying, in general the language is weak

[02:59] tjholowaychuk: wish i had time for that sort of thing
[02:59] kmiyashiro: heh
[02:59] kmiyashiro: I'm not sure what compass is lacking compared to stylus/nib

[03:53] tbranyen: i have and agree with the sentiment
[03:53] Tobsn: JakeWharton, yep
[03:53] Tobsn: sold it
[03:53] Tobsn: 4 month later
[03:53] JakeWharton: I actually prefer my PS3 over the XBOX
[03:53] Tobsn: my lil brother is in a CoD clan

[03:54] path[l]: has anyone here used jquery with driverdan's xhr ?
[03:54] JakeWharton: Because you're little brother and his 19 friends are a perfect representitive sample of all PS3 users everywhere
[03:54] tbranyen: path[l]: like loading jquery into node and using that xhr?
[03:55] Tobsn: no theyre not but it was pretty interesting
[03:55] path[l]: yeah
[03:55] tbranyen: heh no, but it sounds interesting
[03:55] JakeWharton: They most certainly have a lot of overlap but the two platform clearly target different kinds of gamers.
[03:55] JakeWharton: Personally, I use mine as a Blu-ray player about 95% of the time anyways
[03:55] Tobsn: what gamers does the ps3 target?
[03:55] path[l]: ah. people have used both individually. but Im unable to make them work together and get jquery's ajax helpers working
[03:55] Tobsn: see thats what i dont understand

[03:57] path[l]: tbranyen: hmm. so the question is if jsdom lets me attach a xhr object
[03:57] Tobsn: i download movies if i want to see one cause i really only watch it once
[03:58] Tobsn: i mostly even delete them
[03:58] tbranyen: path[l]: try applying it to the window object
[03:58] tbranyen: if you aren't right now, thats most likely your problem
[03:58] path[l]: ok, let me check if I can do that
[03:58] JakeWharton: I only own a small subset of movies I like on Blu-ray and that's usually for the extras.
[03:58] tbranyen: path[l]: you definitely can with jsdom and jquerify within it
[03:59] tbranyen: not sure about node-jquery
[03:59] JakeWharton: I'm not going to buy something that has two SD documentaries and a BD-Live portal that just links to a website
[03:59] JakeWharton: it has to be something with a large collection of extras

[04:00] tbranyen: path[l]: 		return new window.XMLHttpRequest();
[04:00] Tobsn: hmm
[04:00] tbranyen: is how jquery looks for XHR
[04:00] tbranyen: so yeah it definitely needs to be attached there
[04:01] path[l]: the thing is jquery also lets ajax take a function which it can call to let YOU create the xhr object
[04:01] path[l]: but even that wasnt working
[04:01] JusticeFries has joined the channel
[04:01] bartt has joined the channel
[04:01] tbranyen: path[l]: it does? how so?
[04:02] path[l]: it's one of the options is $.ajax

[04:02] tbranyen: path[l]: i don't think so
[04:02] tbranyen: no
[04:03] tbranyen: that just runs after jquery internally creates the xhr object
[04:03] tbranyen: kind of confusing heh
[04:03] path[l]: heh
[04:06] postwait has joined the channel
[04:06] tbranyen: path[l]: jQuery = require('jquery').create(myWindow);
[04:06] tbranyen: myWindow being jsdom().createWindow(); and hten you should be able to attach to that
[04:06] tbranyen: myWindow.XMLHttpRequest = ....
[04:06] path[l]: yeah, Im playing with that

[05:36] chapel: yeah
[05:36] Votaguz: chapel, Any Guide ? 
[05:36] chapel: just send the pages instead of a template
[05:36] chapel: do you want html + templates?
[05:36] chapel: like ejs?
[05:37] ChrisPartridge: chapel: Should be able to put something together with jquery+backbone perhaps
[05:37] Votaguz: Chapel, simply i want to serve html files like "index.html" instead "index.jade" with ExpressJs

[05:38] Votaguz: Can you tell me how ? 
[05:38] Votaguz: Or any guide or document that i can read for learn ?

[06:01] EvanCarroll: I'm moving from a static HTML, I'd like to know if there was something that could go straight from static html to jade.
[06:01] EvanCarroll: It seems like it would be very easy to create, if it doesn't exist
[06:01] EvanCarroll: just so i don't have to remove all these tags, and mark it up myself
[06:01] jmoyers: hmm -- when people use models a la mongoose, where do you normally keep logic like checking a password hash against input? outside the model?
[06:03] dandean: In case anybody wants some mustaches in their Express apps: https://github.com/dandean/mustachio
[06:04] jmoyers: is that different than 'stache'?
[06:05] dandean: jmoyers: yeah. this one provides a place for your view helper logic, alongside your actual mustache template.

[06:07] xeodox: do you guys recommend mongoose-auth to handle all the authentication stuff?
[06:08] abraham has joined the channel
[06:08] jmoyers: dandean: so it adds it binds _data with your locals to the function scope for helper methods
[06:08] jmoyers: instead of using global scope etc?
[06:10] kmiyashiro: hmm
[06:10] kmiyashiro: how do I force js to view a string '[]' as an empty array?
[06:10] ChrisPartridge: xeodox: I'm using it, seems to work fine - probably a bit overkill if you just want mongoose password authentication
[06:11] xeodox: nah i want facebook integration too
[06:11] kmiyashiro: EvanCarroll: Not that I know of
[06:11] xeodox: I started off using everyauth (for facebook)...but then I realize that it's broken. It doesn't handle "scope".
[06:11] amerine has joined the channel
[06:11] ChrisPartridge: xeodox: I think mongoose-auth uses everyauth
[06:11] dguttman has joined the channel
[06:11] xeodox: Chris: Yes. Have you tried facebook with everyauth/mongooseauth?
[06:11] dandean: jmoyers: yeah. Basically, any property not provided in your helper is used as is. You can override properties, allowing you to modify them for your View, and you can create new properties from within your helper to do whatever else, like concatinating first name + last name as {{ name }}. etc....
[06:12] ChrisPartridge: xeodox: Nope

[06:15] dandean: jmoyers: let me know if you run into any trouble then!

[06:17] jmoyers: for anyone that cares, mongoose looks like it has a method called 'method' on Schema that lets you define any arbitrary function, such as for the 'checkPassword' use case i mentioned before.

[09:31] sendark: each message has a .location object
[09:31] fyskij has joined the channel
[09:32] Darshan-NowJS: sure
[09:32] sendark: so it's like  { text : 'text', location :  { name: 'madrid', id:'someid' }, from: { name : 'mum', id : 'someid'  } }
[09:32] Darshan-NowJS: sure
[09:32] sendark: and i am trying to update each of those documents
[09:32] sendark: so what i'm doing
[09:32] sendark: is
[09:32] Darshan-NowJS: i might actually not be the best one to ask for help. its 5am and im goin to bed haha
[09:33] jamey-uk: node newbie, what am I doing wrong here? i'm getting "ReferenceError: filename is not defined" when I request an existing file: http://pastebin.com/0YG0R1cz
[09:33] pig has joined the channel
[09:33] sendark: so forEach message
[09:33] sendark: i'm doing message.location.lng = somelong
[09:33] sendark: msessage.location.lat = somelat
[09:33] sendark: and then save()
[09:34] sendark: but the changes aren't being reflected

[09:37] Darshan-NowJS: reading what you wrote
[09:38] sendark: ok
[09:39] sendark: https://gist.github.com/943982
[09:39] Darshan-NowJS: seems fine to me too
[09:40] xeodox has joined the channel
[09:40] slaskis: sendark: does the save() callback fire?
[09:41] sendark: yep
[09:41] sendark: i'm getting this output:

[09:41] sendark: 	->49.7838623, 22.7677908
[09:41] sendark: success!
[09:42] sendark: so yeah success is firing on the save function
[09:42] sendark: yet when i do a find on the db the location object doesn't have the new fields
[09:42] slaskis: strange

[10:20] sendark: slaskis: hey man about the question before, i fixed it. It was my fault, by defining the schema incorrectly.
[10:20] jetienne: q. where can i find doc on how to install npm on a local directory ? not at system level ?
[10:20] aklt: Hi I have a question about buffers in node 
[10:20] sendark: does anybody know what the best way to output javascript onto a page from a mongoose call?
[10:20] sendark: i.e. search
[10:20] sendark: when using jade
[10:21] iFire has joined the channel
[10:22] aklt: I am decoding a base64 encoded string in chunks.  Sometimes a chunk is in the middle of a multibyte utf8 character and this causes the decoding to utf to fail and I am unsure how to do it correctly
[10:24] aklt: At the time of decoding the base64 I do not know what kind of data this is, so I would like to be able to decode to binary data, but the binary encoding has been deprecated...  Is there an alternative way to handle this?
[10:24] openpercept has joined the channel
[10:26] aklt: With a buffer containing 'på' encoded as base64:
[10:26] slaskis: sendark: great! 
[10:26] aklt: when i do buf.toString('utf8') I get p<C3><A5>
[10:27] aklt: using buf.toString('binary') I get p<C3><83><C2><A5>
[10:28] slaskis: jamey-uk: you could either define the filename variable before step() and assign to it in the first 'step' or i think steps 'this' is passed along all, not sure though
[10:29] hij1nx has joined the channel
[10:30] jamey-uk: slaskis: I just wondered how other noders avoid messy code, I assumed step() was common but maybe not. Cheers though, I'll check out using 'this'
[10:30] sendark: also, why does jade put things meant to go on the head of the document inside the body?
[10:33] slaskis: jamey-uk: not much need for step(), as this does the same thing: https://gist.github.com/c0e53173d88f88364df9 but it's a matter of taste really, also step might be useful if your chain is dynamic and it could handle errors for you (i guess)
[10:34] ph^_ has joined the channel
[10:34] jamey-uk: slaskis: yeah that's how I first assumed to do it, so I'll forget about step(). The way you posted is the most logical and easy to read.

[10:41] sendark: i'm ussing express, does that have to do with it?
[10:42] slaskis: jamey-uk: i still use a chaining library in some cases, like for adding 'hooks' to some methods
[10:43] eldios: sendark, no
[10:43] jamey-uk: slaskis: something like Do, or another library of your own?
[10:44] eldios: try to take out the script part and push in some test stuff
[10:45] sendark: ok you think it's got to do with the script?
[10:45] hackband has joined the channel
[10:45] eldios: yep
[10:45] sendark: eldios: even removing the scripts, the <title> tag appears both on the head and on the body

[10:46] sendark: <link rel="stylesheet" href="/stylesheets/style.css">
[10:46] sendark: which i think express is putting there?
[10:48] sendark: ok got it
[10:48] sendark: there's a file called layout.jade
[10:48] sendark: and that's the one doing the head
[10:49] eldios: yes but you can ovveride that if you want
[10:49] eldios: the layout.jade is useful when you have a common layout for the whole site
[10:51] sendark: yep but if i'm going to be using scripts, i'll be fillng the head with different things

[10:57] k1ttty has joined the channel

[14:44] kkaefer: and I don't really want to use require('../..') in the test code
[14:44] chapel: nibblebot: well if the editor had node.js built in, you could read the module functions easily and make it available to the editor
[14:44] Aikar: kkaefer: add a node_modules/yourmodulename.js that does module.exports = require('../');
[14:45] kkaefer: Aikar: just did that, but I just noticed that that doesn't allow me to include subfiles of that module
[14:45] Aikar: then require('yourmodule') will work inside the tests folder

[15:19] LadyGagaCandy: Wouldn't it be nice if you could write code that looks like sync code (i.e., one line happens and then the next), but is async?
[15:19] ScottR____: i had a question about the events.EventEmitter class; is there a way to stop event propagation?
[15:19] mscdex: nibblebot: yeah
[15:20] softdrink: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/04/working-with-the-chaos-monkey.html
[15:20] LadyGagaCandy: You'd have to specify that the code is prerequisite to the next code. Then beneath that abstraction layer, it would be doing callbacks
[15:20] TheDeveloper: LadyGagaCandy: There are javascript compilers to achieve that
[15:20] pquerna: LadyGagaCandy: someday, but its a different thing than node.js
[15:20] TheDeveloper: streamline.js
[15:20] LadyGagaCandy: TheDeveloper: Is it buggy/problematic though?
[15:20] ScottR____: LadyGagaCandy: that style just strikes me as asking for debugging nightmares
[15:20] LadyGagaCandy: I'm worried about stuff like that breaking in a big, complex project

[15:22] LadyGagaCandy: brianc: The array handling
[15:22] LadyGagaCandy: brianc: I can go look for what I changed to fix it

[15:23] brianc: LadyGagaCandy: if you fixed it, a pull request would be appreciated 
[15:23] ScottR____: TheDeveloper, you seem pretty knowledgeable. Any chance you know the answer to the EventEmitter question?
[15:23] LadyGagaCandy: brianc: So we had trouble when we had empty arrays
[15:24] skohorn has joined the channel
[15:24] Mrfloyd has joined the channel
[15:24] brianc: LadyGagaCandy: could you post a test to reproduce the bug to the github issue? or pull request w/ test & fix would be even better.  I really haven't used arrays within postgres so was waiting for community to fix that.
[15:24] brianc: https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/issues/10
[15:24] LadyGagaCandy: brianc: I would do a pull request, but my fix is really hackish. I just put in a if (column value == "[]") column value = "['']" at the top of the function :(
[15:25] LadyGagaCandy: brianc: Sure, are you here later today?
[15:25] brianc: LadyGagaCandy: ah okay. yeah I should be here
[15:25] LadyGagaCandy: I have to test a deployment, then I will reproduce the bug for you
[15:25] brianc: LadyGagaCandy: k, then i can patch it for you
[15:25] LadyGagaCandy: But my fix isn't very nice :p
[15:26] TheDeveloper: Scottr____: Is there anything in the docs?
[15:26] ScottR____: on halting event propagation? I couldn't find it
[15:26] brianc: the array parsing code isn't good right now...I don't use the feature...but tests which shake out bugs are always welcome, they add to the regression suite and when a better implementation of the array parser comes out...your issue will always be tested for

[15:28] LadyGagaCandy: brianc: Cool
[15:28] TheDeveloper: 01Scottr____: not sure on that one i'm afraid
[15:29] LadyGagaCandy: brianc: It would really help our web app (a market vertical-specific CRM in New York) if we could pull down lib pg directly from npm without having to maintain our own patch :)
[15:29] ScottR____: TheDeveloper: bah. I'm trying to subclass net.Server for a websocket server with all the benefits of any changes that get rolled into the core
[15:29] LadyGagaCandy: I'll get the test case later today
[15:29] brianc: LadyGagaCandy: do you mean pull down the pre-compiled binary? or do you mean pull down a version where the array parsing isn't broken?
[15:30] LadyGagaCandy: brianc: I mean, running 'npm --install pg'
[15:30] ScottR____: TheDeveloper: but I need to hijack the "connection" event to set it up appropriately for web sockets, and then pass that along to the listener set up by the end user
[15:30] harth has joined the channel
[15:30] LadyGagaCandy: brianc: Which is the precompiled, yes.
[15:30] lessthanzero has joined the channel
[15:30] brianc: LadyGagaCandy: you give me a failing test, I'll make it pass and push a new version to npm. then you can "npm install pg" and your array issue should be solved
[15:30] LadyGagaCandy: awesome :)
[15:31] rauchg has joined the channel
[15:31] brianc: LadyGagaCandy: NPM doesn't yet support having pre-compiled binarys, so when you install pg will attempt to link against libpq and build the ".native" part...if the build fails, it continues to install...only the native extensions will be unavailable
[15:31] isaacs has joined the channel
[15:31] TheDeveloper: 07ScottR____01: can't you just wedge your own callback on the connect event which then executes the user callback after it does its websockets stuff?
[15:32] dambalah has joined the channel
[15:32] colinclark has joined the channel
[15:32] ScottR____: TheDeveloper: yes, that's the original solution that I have and it works now, but it sets up a wrapper around the net.Server object and I have to pass through all calls directly to it
[15:32] LadyGagaCandy: brianc: Right, I remember now :)
[15:33] eresair has joined the channel
[15:33] ScottR____: TheDeveloper: and since I'm only writing the library because existing websocket server packages don't adhere to the net.Server API, I need to keep it consistent... which means emitting a "connection" event when a connection is made

[15:34] fumanchu182 has joined the channel
[15:34] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[15:34] ScottR____: TheDeveloper: the problem I'm trying to address is subclassing the WebSocketServer directly from net.Server, which emits a "connection" event every time a connection is made.. so the user callback ends up receiving the first event, AND the second event that I end up emitting with the appropriately modified socket
[15:34] davidvanleeuwen has joined the channel
[15:35] TheDeveloper: this git merge seems to suggest that if your return false out of your event callback, the propagation is stopped: https://github.com/donnerjack13589/node/commit/55a52a9a2f158a155b10d11e78ba18cad04618a9

[16:08] pita: or is there a way to find out if the JSON is valid before we do the parse?!
[16:08] zakabird has joined the channel
[16:09] TheDeveloper: if it says syntax exception, you're typing it wrong
[16:09] ScottR____: I think he's loading it from an external resource?
[16:09] eldios: why a normal try/catch is not working to check if it's not valid?
[16:09] ScottR____: it bugs out the v8 compiler when it comes across something like that
[16:10] ScottR____: because of how v8 implements JSON.parse
[16:10] eldios: oh
[16:10] ScottR____: and throws a not-js error.
[16:10] ScottR____: but last I checked was a while ago, looking again to see if that's still accurat

[16:18] ScottR____: mscdex, TheDeveloper: can i bounce the API change I was planning on recommending off you guys?
[16:18] TheDeveloper: go for it
[16:18] ScottR____: If it's gonna succeed, I'll need to make sure it's rock solid
[16:18] ScottR____: when you attach event listeners, very often you do something like:
[16:19] ScottR____: someObj.addListener( event, function( args ){ someObj.doStuff() } )
[16:19] ScottR____: and the reason you have to use this closure is specifically to reference someObj in the callback
[16:20] ScottR____: why not have the first argument in the callback always be the object that emitted the event?
[16:20] ScottR____: then you could define handlers independent of scope, and attach them via simple pointer instead of generating a closure for every object
[16:20] llkazu: "cause closures are cool"
[16:20] ScottR____: performance change: not super significant, but it's such a small change that it doesn't make sense to keep it as is

[16:22] ScottR____: IMO, it'd lead to cleaner code and better memory efficiency, since it's a simple function reference instead of a closure for every object that has a listener

[16:35] LadyGagaCandy: EyePulp: What django project?

[16:37] EyePulp: it's the service configuration tool for customers of our load of services - a front end for existing customers to manage their accounts, with a billing backend and service management scripts to modify the junk they buy from us.
[16:38] ScottR____: LadyGagaCandy: if I can avoid using PHP ever again in my life, i will consider myself successful. Sole requisite.
[16:38] TheDeveloper: LadyGagaCandy & ScottR: similar situation here, im with you there
[16:38] LadyGagaCandy: ScottR____: At least it's just for templating
[16:38] EyePulp: the old system is on a windows box under classic asp and SQL Server.  moving to django will be delightful
[16:39] ScottR____: LadyGagaCandy: at that point, you might as well run perl...

[17:02] tjholowaychuk: tbranyen: ah cool

[17:02] tbranyen: remysharp: scope is confined to modules
[17:03] EvanCarroll: what's shutdown?
[17:03] remysharp: tbranyen: that's what I thought. then I've balls something up - I've leaky code.

[17:09] mattrobenolt has joined the channel
[17:09] EvanCarroll: oh so it doesn't self-contain the c-lib?

[17:09] tjholowaychuk: EvanCarroll: no
[17:09] isaacs: also, turning every \n into a <br> seems excessive, imo
[17:09] drudge: indeed
[17:10] tjholowaychuk: EvanCarroll: its a large lib, would be pointless to do that
[17:10] jamey-uk: tjholowaychuk: sorry, little bit confused - my first hour using node, express and now express-on-railway... all I did was npm install all of them, then 'railway init' in a new directory. I've changed that 'static' reference, bodyDecoder, cookieDecoder and now about to figure out the mongoDB session storage... but am I going about this the right way?
[17:10] EvanCarroll: what does GFM stand for?

[17:15] drudge: tjholowaychuk: you have email
[17:15] tbranyen: creationix: i'd like to think more about it before diving in tho
[17:15] isaacs: pquerna: that's great info.  i'm considering maybe saying if you have 0.4.7 or higher, it'll default to using ssl.
[17:15] tbranyen: using ffi and such
[17:15] tbranyen: since performance may not matter much for a gui
[17:15] tjholowaychuk: drudge: got it :D
[17:15] creationix: tbranyen: I was inspired to learn node bindings some and made a quick binding to gtkwebview
[17:16] mscdex: high performance guis ftw!
[17:16] tbranyen: creationix: i saw, my buddy miketaylr made in fun of your proj name on twitter heh
[17:16] creationix: tbranyen: using seed, it seems to perform plenty fast
[17:16] creationix: certainly faster than anything I could make web based
[17:16] isaacs: pquerna: oh, wait, looks like the iriscouch ssl is busted atm... maybe not :)
[17:16] jamey-uk: tjholowaychuk: sorry, turns out getting the latest from git solved everything :)

[17:44] malkomalko: tjholowaychuk: you around? got a quick stylus question.. which is awesome btw
[17:44] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: yup, what's up?
[17:45] malkomalko: a) is it possible in the repl to test multi line functions? or is just basic one line stuff
[17:45] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: just basic stuff right now
[17:46] malkomalko: b) I'm trying to figure out how to take a tuple like this ("#element" 12px) (".another" 20px)
[17:46] __tomb has joined the channel
[17:46] malkomalko: possible to grab that "#element" and use that as a literal in a function so that you can build up dynamically sets of styles?
[17:47] malkomalko: for t in tuples... p(t[0]) gives me "#element" but I can't figure out how to actually place it so that I can use it to nest css rules underneath it
[17:47] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: selectors dont have interpolation support right now unfortunately
[17:47] tjholowaychuk: its on my todo list
[17:47] malkomalko: tried unquote(t[0]) and {t[0]} but no workie
[17:48] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: I'll see if I can get selector interpolation in there soon
[17:48] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus/issues/108
[17:48] malkomalko: I'm picturing a lot of possibilities from that
[17:48] tjholowaychuk: totally

[17:52] remysharp: does anyone know if module variables going global is a bug or a feature of node? (I'm on 0.5.0-pre)
[17:52] Aikar: remysharp: example?
[17:52] malkomalko: want me to fork and try working on it tjholowaychuk?
[17:52] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: yeah sure if you want to
[17:52] remysharp: put a global in a module. require said module. that global is now available in all other modules
[17:53] Aikar: if you do global[x].. then yes itll be global
[17:53] remysharp: I thought globals in modules were localised to the module - but it doesn't appear to be
[17:53] Aikar: thats kind of the point of global
[17:53] Aikar: nope
[17:53] Aikar: just use 'var x' for local variables
[17:53] remysharp: aye, but I thought one of the benefits of the require/module pattern was that globals couldn't leak out
[17:53] malkomalko: ok, going to do that now, pretty sure I have your lex/token/parsing style down now from jade/stylus
[17:53] remysharp: (of modules)
[17:54] Aikar: remysharp: you cant accidently make a global
[17:54] Squeese has joined the channel
[17:54] xeodox has left the channel

[17:54] Aikar: doing foo = x wont be global
[17:54] remysharp: Aikar: that's what I'm saying *is* happening
[17:54] onre has joined the channel
[17:54] remysharp: hence confusion/worry!
[17:55] Squeese: Where does the source etc for nodejs go on my mac after installation?
[17:55] Aikar: remysharp: hmm, your right
[17:55] remysharp: could I put a quick gist together to validate?
[17:55] Aikar: i just did it
[17:55] malkomalko: it's ok, I'll stumble my way around the code
[17:55] remysharp: ah cool
[17:55] malkomalko: blow shit up
[17:55] jmorris_ has joined the channel
[17:55] remysharp: well - not cool - it shouldn't leak, right?
[17:55] malkomalko: write some tests and hopefully it goes green
[17:55] Aikar: well
[17:56] Aikar: i dunno
[17:56] remysharp: unless you do it explicitly, like global.foo = 'x';
[17:56] remysharp: that's the point of the export
[17:56] Aikar: i dont know of the performance implications of running every module in a new context
[17:56] remysharp: you can call your module foo
[17:56] remysharp: and I can call my module foo
[17:56] remysharp: but the developer can require the modules as foo1 and foo2
[17:56] jmorris_: can someone point me to, or help me to understand how i would use util.inherits with required(...)?
[17:56] remysharp: but if they're global in each of the modules you and I made - it's fuck city
[17:56] Aikar: well, ideally, we shouldnt be putting crutches in to protect people from writing bad code
[17:57] Aikar: if you do it on browser side, itll also bite you
[17:57] remysharp: sure - but what about testing two different version of underscore for instance?
[17:57] malkomalko: tjholowaychuk.. do you know if you can do that type of interpolation in compass?
[17:57] remysharp: browser don't have a true require system
[17:57] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: you mean sass?
[17:57] malkomalko: yes
[17:57] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: I think so
[17:57] Aikar: reducing performance for an extreme usecase isnt desirable
[17:57] harth has joined the channel
[17:57] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: wouldnt be hard to add, I haev it for props already
[17:57] tjholowaychuk: just need to add it to selectors
[17:57] remysharp: Aikar: is that for me?
[17:57] Aikar: remysharp: yea
[17:58] malkomalko: yup, I'll see if I can find the right spot
[17:58] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: stylus is just much more complicated since {} etc are optional
[17:58] langworthy has joined the channel
[17:58] remysharp: Aikar: it's required once, I don't see the performance hit to sandbox the module
[17:58] tjholowaychuk: if I was parsing regular css only it would be much easier
[17:58] malkomalko: yup
[17:58] Aikar: if your seriously needing to use 2 diff versions of a library, should really try to find another solution
[17:58] malkomalko: ok, be back later
[17:58] Aikar: remysharp: you have to spawn a new context for every module load to stop it
[17:59] Aikar: and for what gain? rescueing people from code mistakes?
[17:59] remysharp: Aikar: which we both thought that was happening in the first place though
[17:59] Aikar: i thought that yeah, i thought runinthiscontext may of blocked it
[17:59] Aikar: but if not, the only solution is runinnewcontext
[17:59] remysharp: Aikar: no, but implicit globals a fucked part of javascript, I thought it was fixed in the require system that's all
[18:00] rmustacc: remysharp: Implicit globals are fixed. Explicit is not.
[18:00] Aikar: you can write a line thatll dump all globals and find leaks
[18:00] onre_ has joined the channel
[18:01] remysharp: rmustacc: nope - globals are available across all modules
[18:01] Aikar: aniero
[18:01] Aikar: mt
[18:01] rmustacc: remysharp: What do you consider implicit globals?
[18:01] remysharp: rmustacc: sans "var"
[18:01] remysharp: rmustacc: and ones that are available throughout /all/ code in your application
[18:01] jano has joined the channel

[18:04] rmustacc: remysharp: Well, in this case it does look like they are all being launched from the same parent, thus not properly scoping your variables will cause them to leak.
[18:04] rmustacc: Nothing a simple linter can't catch.
[18:04] TheDeveloper: mustacc: Yeah I have been, just wondred if there are any others out there as activity seems to be relatively low on that project
[18:05] remysharp: rmustacc: so you lint every external module you include?

[18:28] ScottR____: the other file that you put MyStream into should be the one that requires the util and events libraries
[18:28] ScottR____: which part of mystream are you trying to abstract into a separate file?
[18:28] jmorris: all of myStream
[18:29] deedubs: jmorris: does commonJS or module.exports mean anything to you?

[18:29] jmorris: that's fine :)

[18:29] ScottR____: err
[18:30] ScottR____: pull utils in*
[18:30] ScottR____: but you could take everything in the example
[18:30] ScottR____: and at the end, put exports.MyStream = MyStream

[18:31] jmorris: yeah
[18:31] ScottR____: even that last .MyStream bit?
[18:32] jmorris: oh!
[18:32] ScottR____: otherwise MyStream is just your namespace, and you'd have to do the equivalent of new MyStream.MyStream(), which (as written) i believe gives an error

[19:12] egeriis: Hi guys, I'm having troulbe with my node installation on OS X 10.6.7. I got node installed and succeeded in running a script from the command line. After trying to install npm, which didn't go that well, I tried restarting the Terminal. Now I am unable to run either node or npm commands from the Terminal. Any clue?
[19:12] isaacs: egeriis: where did you install node?
[19:12] isaacs: egeriis: did you run some "export PATH=blah" command manually in the terminal?
[19:13] egeriis: Yeah, I think that was prior to the make command.
[19:13] context: you need to put it in your profile
[19:13] context: egeriis: you should really consider using something like homebrew to handle package management
[19:13] tauren has joined the channel
[19:13] egeriis: But actually it appears that the addition I made to $PATH has disappeared
[19:13] Bonuspunkt: nibblebot afaik at prototype u dont have a way to access the instance, so that is the only way?
[19:13] context: egeriis: cause you closed the terminal.
[19:14] brianc: egeriis: yeah, every time your console starts up it runs a sort of "boot script" file commonly stored at ~/.bashrc
[19:14] mike27: i'm developing a product that is used in the browser and using custom apps with our api. it requires realtime streaming data, so i thought about using a websocket. i looked into socket.io, but it looks like there is no client library for .net or java. so what is the best practice for a realtime api that is used both in the browser and using custom desktop apps? thx in advance for your help
[19:14] egeriis: So I could modify .bashrc to avoid the need for altering $PATH on each launch of Terminal?
[19:14] brianc: egeriis: you need to modify this file to automatically adjust your "PATH" environment variable (the one you manually changed before running make) so it's adjusted every time your console starts
[19:14] nibblebot: Bonuspunkt: for constructing new instances, isn't the way you showed more expensive than prototype? but since you cannot access the instance i guess i have no choice
[19:15] V1: mike27: http://code.google.com/p/socketio-java/
[19:15] V1: :D?
[19:15] brianc: egeriis: for more info google "path environment variable bashrc"
[19:15] egeriis: brianc: Right, I will try to look at this.
[19:15] Bonuspunkt: nibblebot do not know - lets jsperf it :D
[19:15] context: mike27: maybe checkout faye and find a bayeux library for .net and java
[19:15] mike27: V1: i may be mistaken, but this looks like a socket.io server
[19:16] V1: yes it's a socket.io server written in Java

[19:16] onre_ has joined the channel
[19:16] V1: ._. or isn't that what you wanted
[19:17] egeriis: brianc, context: Wonderful, node seems to be running now. Now, what is homebrew, is that instead of using npm or ...?
[19:17] brianc: google for homebrew
[19:17] brianc: is like NPM for your whole system, sorta
[19:17] mike27: V1: my clients would need a socket.io client to connect to my platform
[19:17] brianc: so you can "brew install mysql" for example
[19:18] egeriis: brianc: So I could've installed node this way?
[19:18] V1: oh you want a socket.io client impllementation written in Java mike27
[19:18] mike27: context: how much latency does faye add to small messages approximately?

[19:28] cbiscardi: context: it works well for switching between node/npm versions

[19:37] isaacs: egeriis: looks like your DNS servers are being flaky :)

[20:18] mscdex: yay it works this time!
[20:18] gf3: remysharp: currently it disallows access to the node stdlib
[20:18] tauren: is there a good authorization/authentication module for node? anything that has remeberme features built in? And password hashing features. 
[20:18] gf3: remysharp: but it would be easy to allow node access, although there's no way I can make that truly secure
[20:18] remysharp: gf3: that might not be a problem - if it's more a poke around to test out node for the first time
[20:19] egeriis: My new app can't find the modules that I've places in ~/local/node/lib/node_modules, is node looking for modules in the project directory and is it possible to share the modules across all apps?
[20:19] gf3: remysharp: cool, then it should be easy, I can provide an update in a bit

[20:19] v8bot: tauren: substack/node-sesame - GitHub - https://github.com/substack/node-sesame

[20:19] chapel: that might work for you tauren, but I haven't used it
[20:19] context: chapel: znc and irssi
[20:19] mscdex: egeriis: iirc it starts looking for node_modules in the current dir and then traverses up the current path for node_modules
[20:19] chapel: kk context
[20:20] chapel: I use linkinus
[20:20] tauren: chapel: thanks, I'll check it out
[20:20] remysharp: gf3: yeah that's what I'm thinking
[20:20] context: i think i tried that for a little while. it aggrevated me
[20:20] context: forget why though :x
[20:20] mscdex: egeriis: not sure if it looks in the node binary's path
[20:20] remysharp: gf3: except I've only got a couple of days before my whole workshop has to be ready, so it might be a quick and dirty interface to your sandbox just for simplistic playing
[20:20] chapel: no worries, if you are used to a shell/light irc client like irssi, it is definitely a different experience
[20:21] mscdex: node irc client!
[20:21] mscdex: ncurses power!

[20:27] chapel: I was laughing at context
[20:27] chapel: not at, with
[20:27] mscdex: chapel: the irc client example isn't a complete client, but most of the basic stuff is there
[20:28] mscdex: ScottR____: well, before you require a file in lib/ you could make sure that the extension is '.js' and that the file begins with [a-zA-z0-9]
[20:28] mscdex: .js or .node actually
[20:29] ScottR____: seems reasonable
[20:29] chapel: yeah mscdex
[20:29] blueadept: how do you give a div two id's in jade?
[20:29] chapel: well you can do .coffee as well
[20:29] mscdex: two ids? :S

[20:31] gf3: not everyone wants an IDE
[20:32] ScottR____: okay, text editor with syntax highlighting ;P
[20:32] chapel: I just want an editor :)

[20:33] ScottR____: chapel: right, just taking it to the extreme for comedy ;P
[20:33] gf3: ScottR____: I'm not knocking emacs, but I prefer vim
[20:33] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: though its not always calls since its css haha it just includes all the blocks like selector blocks n stuff
[20:33] tjholowaychuk: as well as function calls
[20:33] ScottR____: gf3: i'm not exactly beholden to emacs, i just figured i should use it at least once in my life
[20:34] malkomalko: aight, I've got the 108 test case all setup
[20:34] chapel: tjholowaychuk: does stylus support css file combination and minification?
[20:34] tjholowaychuk: chapel: it has compression support but not aggregation no
[20:34] mscdex: i used emacs once in my life, and that was enough :P
[20:34] tjholowaychuk: stylus is not the right place for that
[20:34] chapel: yeah tjholowaychuk
[20:34] mscdex: and that time wasn't by choice
[20:34] mscdex: :D
[20:34] ScottR____: mscdex: to be fair, after about 5 days of use, i am getting significantly faster with it
[20:34] chapel: is there a node library/module that does that?

[20:47] tjholowaychuk: gonsfx: if you have static() above session()

[21:17] isaacs: EvanCarroll: if you publish something, it's yours
[21:17] isaacs: EvanCarroll: you can add other authors to the project if you want.
[21:18] EvanCarroll: so if someone else wants to a push a patch to you, and you refuse, the community can't usurp your control over the module?
[21:18] isaacs: EvanCarroll: well, i'm a server admin
[21:18] isaacs: EvanCarroll: so *i* can.  but the community at large can't, to
[21:18] isaacs: *no

[21:19] EvanCarroll: isaacs: CPAN has shown me that is impossible.
[21:20] isaacs: if i get hit by a bus, then there will be a bloody accession, and someone else will set up a registry and people will use that instead.
[21:20] EvanCarroll: the big issue isn't copyright, or maliciousness, it's assmonkey authors that refuse to relinquish maintainership and go inactive for months at a time.
[21:20] isaacs: right.
[21:20] isaacs: in those cases, i ask people to email the author, and then if there's no response for a few weeks, i'll step in and do whatever's necessary
[21:20] isaacs: you need a king.
[21:20] isaacs: but a lazy king is the best kind
[21:21] EvanCarroll: On CPAN, I fork into ::ButMaintained, which they view as malicious, but they never reserved the right over package names, and no one ever challanged the status quo to have them removed.
[21:21] zzak: ACTION forks express, publishes exprezz (rewritten in coffeescript)
[21:21] EvanCarroll: But, it has created problems with authors who uphold that their module is Maintained, and having a ::ButMaintained variant isn't accurate or fair

[21:53] felixge: but I guess that's ok
[21:53] mscdex: nibblebot: i'm confused as to why you need a closure there and can't just assign module.exports to your function(str){}
[21:54] isaacs: felixge: that's fine. you could just have that as additional diagnostic
[21:54] felixge: I really dislike tap output
[21:54] felixge: but I guess it does integrate with a few tools out there
[21:54] isaacs: felixge: sure, but it's a) the standard and b) very parseable
[21:54] isaacs: it's better than http :)
[21:54] felixge: ;)
[21:54] isaacs: it'd be worthwhile to output tap when process.env.TAP=1 at least
[21:55] isaacs: and something more humane otherwise.
[21:55] isaacs: this will be my summer/autumn
[21:55] felixge: isaacs: I was thinking about -f tap

[22:01] mscdex: baudehlo: it depends on the type of method, if it needs to work directly with the instance, i'll tack it on the prototype with a '_' prefix. otherwise i just declare it as a plain old non-exported private function in the module
[22:01] cbiscardi has joined the channel
[22:03] baudehlo: mscdex: well it's a method rather than a function if you get my drift.
[22:03] mscdex: i don't? :)
[22:04] baudehlo: but I do like the idea that plain old "function blah () {" can be a private method that you execute via blah.call(this, ...)
[22:04] baudehlo: mscdex: as in it should have access to "this"
[22:04] Bwen has joined the channel
[22:05] baudehlo: hmm, I guess that breaks inheritance though.
[22:05] mscdex: baudehlo: or you could avoid any .call overhead and just do blah(this, ...)
[22:05] baudehlo: right, but then this becomes a param rather than the explicit "this"
[22:05] mscdex: baudehlo: right
[22:06] baudehlo: I think I'll just use exports.prototype._blah
[22:06] secoif has joined the channel

[22:58] mscdex: well, it's a 32 bit number so just push each byte
[22:58] mscdex: the first 4 bytes
[22:58] baudehlo: and then how do I get that 4 bytes as a javascript number?
[22:58] coreb: I guess he wants a readAsUint from the stream
[23:00] mscdex: baudehlo: something like: var length = (buf[0] << 24) +  (buf[1] << 16) +  (buf[2] << 8) + buf[3]
[23:01] baudehlo: yikes...
[23:01] mscdex: heh
[23:01] baudehlo: though I guess that works.
[23:02] baudehlo: fuckit, I'll work on this tomorrow (adding a proper outbound queueing mail server to Haraka)
[23:02] baudehlo: just worried it'll be used by spammers. :)
[23:02] baudehlo: since it'll scale so well to gajillions of connections

[23:17] coreb: no
[23:17] isaacs: pyrotechnick1: what's up?

[23:19] moshe: in the client page?
[23:19] pyrotechnick1: is it maybe because coffee is global
[23:20] pyrotechnick1: this is a way fresh install, new node, new npm

[23:22] techwraith: step four of what?
[23:22] mscdex: step 4 of confusion!
[23:22] isaacs: pyrotechnick1: if you do `node` to drop into the repl, then `require("dnode")` does it work?
[23:22] pyrotechnick1: yes :(
[23:22] confused: lol, no step 4 of setting up the node in cygwin
[23:22] isaacs: pyrotechnick1: what if you compile your server.coffee to a server.js, then does it work?

[23:26] pyrotechnick1: i think it inspects the package.json's
[23:26] pyrotechnick1: SubStack: does it?
[23:26] moshe: well what can I do then?
[23:26] pyrotechnick1: yeah it's browserify for sure

[23:27] davida_ has joined the channel
[23:28] SubStack: yes
[23:28] pyrotechnick1: sick dog
[23:28] coreb: moshe: you need to set up node.js to serve your client file from the server as a static file
[23:28] pyrotechnick1: isaacs: interesting
[23:29] pyrotechnick1: isabel:webclient pyrotechnick$ node_modules/.bin/coffee server.coffee
[23:29] pyrotechnick1: that works
[23:29] pyrotechnick1: in the future computers won't have paths
[23:29] isaacs: srsly
[23:29] pyrotechnick1: paths will be removed from the POSIX standard
[23:29] jesusabdullah: NOOO :(
[23:29] moshe: ok, let's see how its getting done
[23:29] jesusabdullah: Gurl don't go deprecatin my paths
[23:29] isaacs: pyrotechnick1: hm.  i wonder if coffee-script's require.registerExtensions voodoo is not playing nicely with the node_modules folder thingies
[23:29] SubStack: pyrotechnick1: if you add ./node_modules to the base option browserify might be able to figure it out
[23:30] SubStack: actually probably not
[23:30] isaacs: devrim: replied
[23:30] pyrotechnick1: i might try and help jash fix it today
[23:30] isaacs: that'd be rad
[23:30] confused: The step 4 I was referring to was here: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Building-node.js-on-Cygwin-(Windows)  'set up domain name resolution' I did what it said to do, and I still get the ECONNREFUSED error
[23:30] coreb: moshe: would be easier to use express.js to do that part
[23:30] devrim: thx isaacs
[23:30] isaacs: i wonder if maybe the registerExtensions thing is happening before the realpath or something
[23:31] isaacs: ACTION back to working on nodeconf talk.  see ya.
[23:31] moshe: so I should be using express instead of faye?
[23:31] moshe: or on top of?
[23:32] coreb: no, use express to set up paths and return html ;)
[23:32] coreb: you need to get your client script into your browser
[23:32] coreb: through a normal http request initially

[23:53] brownies: mscdex: nginx returns 504 gateway time out when i submit the sign-up form

[23:57] mscdex: although i'm not sure how many people use node on 10.5
