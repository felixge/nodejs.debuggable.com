[01:49] isaacs: TooTallNate: put !build/ in your .npmignore file
[01:49] isaacs: TooTallNate: but why do you wanna do that?
[01:49] TooTallNate: isaacs: i wanted to try this out: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-weak/blob/master/index.js#L4
[01:49] TooTallNate: for windows
[01:49] TooTallNate: so I have a precompiled binary
[01:50] TooTallNate: at: ./build/win32/ia32/weakref.node
[01:50] isaacs: TooTallNate: npm publish --bin-publish
[01:50] isaacs: TooTallNate: this will publish the bin tagged with the os, version, and architecture.
[01:51] isaacs: TooTallNate: anyone who has the same set will get the binary one instead of the source one
[01:51] TooTallNate: isaacs: interesting. so then how do I require it in my index.js?
[01:51] isaacs: require("./build/win32/ia32/weakref.node")?
[01:51] willwhite has joined the channel
[01:51] isaacs: TooTallNate: put in a try/catch for if it's not there, i guess
[01:51] TooTallNate: isaacs: sorry, i guess i don't see what --bin-publish does that I'm not doing already
[01:52] isaacs: TooTallNate: it's a very experimental feature.
[01:52] isaacs: TooTallNate: it does it for you, such that only windows users get the win32 bin.
[01:52] insin: warz:  the way I've come to think of it is "well, what did people do before <thing I like> existed for <other language/framework> - if you like to do things a particular way, you can either look for implementations or write them
[01:52] isaacs: TooTallNate: linux/solaris/mac users will get the source.

[01:53] insin: I honestly think I had my first "this is Nooooode!" experience today, hacking together a quick HTTP server to allow testers to run a long-running workaround job thingy on my machine by hittinga URL while I tried to fix an environment
[01:53] TooTallNate: ok, so pretty much sounds like what I need
[01:53] caioketo: there is some websocket server in node.js?
[01:53] isaacs: TooTallNate: yep.
[01:53] isaacs: :)
[01:53] caioketo: that works with binary?
[01:54] TooTallNate: isaacs: so then, wouldn't I have to npm publish on each different machine?
[01:54] TooTallNate: that I want to support?
[01:54] isaacs: TooTallNate: yes.
[01:54] isaacs: TooTallNate: or expect users to have a build toolchain, which is reasonable for most unixes.
[01:54] isaacs: slightly less so for mac.
[01:54] TooTallNate: subsequent times, is it only gonna publish 1 more tarball?
[01:54] isaacs: TooTallNate: you'll have to do the bin-publish each time you wanna publish a binary package.
[01:54] insin: warz: uh... also... I have an implemenatation of what you're looking for, although it's very raw at the moment! https://github.com/insin/urlresolve

[01:55] TooTallNate: haha
[01:55] TooTallNate: i remember ;)
[01:55] isaacs: lots of non-binary packages have build scripts, and it broke them.
[01:55] isaacs: (like express, for instance)
[01:56] isaacs: or they're just not built with binary dist in mind.
[01:56] isaacs: so they .npmignore and.gitignore the build artifacts.

[02:27] k1ttty has joined the channel
[02:27] JasonSmith: nah, I don't think it's tap's fault. It was the traceback module, which I'm happy with despite having started it well after I did a correct search for similar packages

[02:27] moogoo: hmm seems like insta segfault..
[02:27] DTrejo: i'm back in the bay area!! yayyyyy

[02:28] DTrejo: time to code code code and not do any schoolwork!
[02:28] ^robertj: isaacs, err I guess allocating the memory isn't a problem but err, I assume there would still be numerous ways to _use_ gobs of memory between ticks
[02:28] JasonSmith: The problem with getting a traceback in v8 is you have to go through the Error object. Like, the global one. And also tracebacks don't seem a priori have anything to do with errors, but they happened to be implemented in the error handling code
[02:28] isaacs: happy holidays everyone.  run `npm xmas` when you get a chance.
[02:28] jesusabdullah: DTrejo: Welcome :P

[02:29] towski has joined the channel
[02:29] JasonSmith: So, I modify the Error object to do all this crazy stuff. But every time I call into tap, it also creates errors and parses their .stack
[02:29] ^robertj: (your Buffer sample didnt cause any problems :)
[02:30] JasonSmith: Both the traceback module and tap are doing the best they can given the tools. In fact the thing I'm proud of with traceback is it's pretty robust about detecting and correcting contention with other code also poking around the Error traceback code
[02:30] isaacs: robertj: var b = new Buffer(Math.pow(1024, 4)); for (var i = 0; i < b.length; i ++) b[i] = 'x'.charCodeAt(0)
[02:30] ^robertj: isaacs, that happens all in one tick?
[02:30] isaacs: robertj: yeah
[02:30] moogoo: one very long tick
[02:30] isaacs: robertj: a "tick" is just "one pass through your code".

[02:32] bluebit has joined the channel
[02:32] moogoo: huh
[02:32] ^robertj: moogoo, just trying to accomidate tons and tons of very short-lived crappily written programs by not having the overhead
[02:32] ^robertj: moogoo, for example, i'v got a test prog that uses the v8 debug protocol to step the v8 with continue stepcount=1
[02:33] moogoo: and you're doing this cause you're worried about crazy user code
[02:34] ^robertj: I don't mind the overhead of a process pool
[02:34] ^robertj: yeah that's basically what a mush is :P
[02:34] moogoo: v8 does have some facilities for stepping/saving/having multiple contexts
[02:34] moogoo: but the v8 api docs are trash
[02:34] ^robertj: moogoo, so I currently can measure the memory usage between each step
[02:35] moogoo: but you only care if there is a suspiscously large amount of mem usage
[02:35] ^robertj: yes and id also like to take some sample measurements to 'bill' them in game credits for their computing allowance
[02:35] moogoo: lol
[02:36] ^robertj: yeah i know, it's all sillyness :)
[02:36] moogoo: so if I throw a while(1){} in your game, I'm getting a huge bill in the mail
[02:36] moogoo: just check the child process after 1 second
[02:37] ^robertj: yeah, or more seriously your in game allowance will all get spent, your programs wont run, and you will be out of luck until you get a micro allowance payement :)
[02:37] moogoo: anything that takes longer to compute is clearly evil
[02:37] ^robertj: moogoo, that's more or less the idea
[02:37] moogoo: you can do that without mucking around in v8 internals

[02:38] moogoo: it's hard to say with how tricky v8 is 
[02:38] c4milo has joined the channel
[02:38] ^robertj: if so, no problem, ill subsect the second down into 20 increments and check with the v8 profiler
[02:38] ^robertj: however if they can allocate 200 megs of ram in a _step_ i'm screwed

[02:39] moogoo: wonder how far it got
[02:39] ^robertj: moogoo, tahts multipel steps right?
[02:39] moogoo: steps of what
[02:39] moogoo: thats one nodejsTick
[02:39] moogoo: at least
[02:40] moogoo: since nextTick will not  be called till it's good and done
[02:40] ^robertj: so one tick but a step is apparently something lower
[02:40] boltR has joined the channel
[02:40] moogoo: like a debug step
[02:40] ^robertj: yes exactly
[02:40] lorfds has joined the channel
[02:40] moogoo: it's at most 10000 of those
[02:40] skm has joined the channel
[02:40] moogoo: but the problem in that was the s+=s
[02:40] moogoo: dunno how far it got
[02:41] moogoo: but I'm guessing the damange one can do in 1-3 seconds is minimal
[02:41] ^robertj: it doesn't matter, what matters is the amount of change in a tick
[02:41] ^robertj: because im gonna have 3 other processess on this machine happily consuming ram as well
[02:41] ^robertj: and i dont want them to go OOM because someone consumed 512 megs in a step
[02:42] ^robertj: if you go more than a fraction of a second a debugger is gonna get hooked up a break introduced into your program at the next tick
[02:42] moogoo: I'm sure there are at least OS utilties to use to monitor process memory usage

[02:49] ^robertj: but it still happens rihgt?

[03:08] ^robertj: yeah and every once in a while htat would be OK, so as long as i could catch it
[03:09] ^robertj: but they could use lots of ram over very short periods and not get 'billed' for it though
[03:09] ^robertj: you would never know
[03:09] moogoo: maybe just a cron job...run it every 5 min or so and trash out of controll node proccses
[03:09] ^robertj: nonono, i'm thinking like a second max on a job
[03:10] moogoo: I wonder if there's any in-node way to monitor details of a child process
[03:10] ^robertj: do you count he v8 debugger?
[03:10] moogoo: I'm still stalling on upgrading to .6
[03:11] moogoo: maybe...but the debugger is major overhead and potentially insecure
[03:11] ^robertj: it works fine with the caveat that you cant monitor between _steps_, which is why i'm so concerned with burstyness
[03:11] moogoo: v8 does provide some seemingly powerful ways to deal with multiple threaded contexts

[09:40] SubStack: new mad science experiment: https://github.com/substack/upnode
[09:40] Nuck: I just want my paths relative to process.cwd
[09:41] Nuck: SubStack: Ooooh nice
[09:41] Nuck: I really hate that require is relative to the module and not relative to my project's root
[09:41] stagas: Nuck: you can pass the require function from your app to the module
[09:42] Nuck: stagas: I don't want some stupid hack
[09:42] Nuck: I want a solution
[09:42] Nuck: I want require to resolve relative to my project root when I do "./lib/thing.js"
[09:43] Nuck: I'm having to keep note of how many "../" deep I am in each file
[09:43] Nuck: So I know where my project root is
[09:44] Nuck: This is just ridiculous, when it's as simple as having relative paths resolved from process.cwd
[09:44] caioketo: hey, anyone knows something like socket.io but supporting binaries transfer, and just websocket (dont need flash, etc) ??
[09:44] Nuck: caioketo: WebSockets with base64-encoded binary data?
[09:45] insin: I need some sort of mindswitch which automatically detects that I'm writing code which will only ever be run in Node
[09:45] caioketo: no
[09:45] caioketo: just binary, i wont encode it
[09:45] Nuck: What's wrong with resolving relative to process.cwd, I've never gotten a straight answer
[09:45] caioketo: otherwise it will get too slow
[09:46] Nuck: caioketo: :| Well then I'm pretty sure you're outta luck, man.
[09:46] caioketo: i saw einaros ws
[09:46] caioketo: wich supports binary
[09:46] Nuck: I don't think clientside JS works well with binary data
[09:46] Nuck: In fact, I know it doesn't.
[09:46] caioketo: what the problem with binay?
[09:46] Nuck: It *can* do it, just not effectively at all
[09:46] Nuck: caioketo: the fact that it's not a data type in JS?
[09:47] Nuck: The fact that we lack Blobs or Buffers on the clientside?
[09:47] caioketo: JS dont have byte like data type?
[09:47] Nuck: caioketo: Not natively, last I checked.
[09:47] Nuck: caioketo: There's thinkgs like TypedArrays, but nothing else
[09:48] Nuck: At least, AFAIK
[09:48] Nuck: caioketo: client-side JS is definitely faster with base64 than it would be with binary
[09:49] caioketo: so, if I base64encode it on server, it will work like a array of chars, instead of array of bytes?

[09:58] Nuck: I guess it's possible, I think Firefox has support for TypedArrays

[11:12] TheJH: LeMike, node is on a lower level than that
[11:14] TheJH: LeMike, there are popular frameworks on top of it like "express" that you can use for making webapps or so, but node's own webserver stuff is just "I'll call this function for every incoming HTTP request on the entire server"

[14:19] TheJH: elliottcable, would the fd number help you?

[14:20] elliottcable: TheJH: In some cases, if I want to be particularily unflexible.
[14:20] TheJH: elliottcable, :D
[14:20] elliottcable: Basically, I'm trying to *as directly as possible* expose the ncurses `newterm(3)` API, which expects an input-filedes and an output-filedes
[14:20] elliottcable: ideally, I'd like to be able to (from Node-side, and using Node-FS-idioms) describe various targets for those
[14:22] elliottcable: but even the mapping of the concepts is difficult at a high level ... much less how to *implement* them, navigating my way through the series of clusterfucks that is A) how Node treats “files” (/(Read|Write)able ‘Streams’/), B) how libuv treats the same (???, no idea, I'm not familiar with libuv yet); C) how C++ treats the streams, and D) how lower-level UNIX APIs treat the FDs relating to the C++ streams

[15:48] bayesian: hm don't know about that
[15:48] marcello3d: it's a pretty standard node.js thing...
[15:49] moogoo: buffer data is stored outside the v8 heap
[15:49] marcello3d: I just don't want to do the whole double alloc and copy thing from scratch if there's a preferred way
[15:50] bayesian: then just start with a big enough buffer

[16:01] doctorm: Does anyone know why RegExp.exec would correctly match a strong only every other time?
[16:01] doctorm: s/strong/string
[16:01] Lingerance: Because you set it to global
[16:02] doctorm: Lingerance: Ah. That's probably it! Thanks. But why?
[16:02] Lingerance: global means look for more than one match
[16:03] Lingerance: You have to loop until you hit null to get all of them.
[16:03] Lingerance: Otherwise it only grabs the first possible match
[16:04] doctorm: Ok, so if I did something like while(matches = regex.exec(myLine[i]) !== null) { }
[16:04] doctorm: That would fix it? I mean, I guess it doesn't need to be global, I just took that out and it worked
[16:04] Lingerance: I'm not sure if that does what you want because I don't know the order of operations
[16:05] Lingerance: while (null !== (matches = regex.exec(myLine[i]))) { }
[16:05] Lingerance: That'll work for sure though.
[16:05] doctorm: I'm just trying to understand how exec works. String.match with global worked fine for testing the line, but didn't give me the captures
[16:05] moogoo: or just while (matches = regex.exec(blah))
[16:06] moogoo: exec gives you more information than match
[16:06] moogoo: .. /lol/.exec('catlolbot')
[16:06] catb0t:  [ "lol", index: 3, input: "catlolbot" ]
[16:06] doctorm: Thanks, I found it a bit perplexing. The fact that you can use exec on a new line that should work, but it returns null, is counterintuitive
[16:07] doctorm: Yeah, moogoo, that's why I had to use it.
[16:07] elliottcable: ryah: (I'm headed off to slepe, but I'd still really like to have a quick chat with you 'bout Node, libuv, `FILE*`-streams/POSIX FDs, and the “appropriate” [in your opinion] way to map those concepts across eachother. Hilight me when you're around!)
[16:07] moogoo: just how it works
[16:07] elliottcable: s/slepe/sleep/
[16:08] moogoo: I miss my callable regexp's
[16:08] Lingerance: Also: RegExp.prototype.matchAll = function(str) { var arr = [], match, li = this.lastIndex; this.lastIndex = 0; if (this.global) { while (null !== (match = this.exec(str))) { arr.push(match) } else { arr.push(this.exec(str)) }; this.lastIndex = li; return arr }

[17:09] bayesian: How do you avoid repeating base html code in mustache?
[17:09] bayesian: I don't really want to repeat all the header and navigation stuff in every template....
[17:10] GrizzLyCRO1: i do not know how mustache works, but
[17:10] GrizzLyCRO1: it should be possible to render html from mustache in variable?
[17:11] GrizzLyCRO1: so you render your content page in variable, and insert it in layout

[17:24] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[17:25] igl1: ^^
[17:25] gflarity: boltR: what happens?
[17:25] igl1: because exec is asnycron
[17:25] gflarity: oh ya
[17:25] boltR: gflarity: result is undefined
[17:25] igl1: it will fill up "result" long after it returned already
[17:25] igl: going nowhere
[17:26] boltR: ah i see
[17:26] boltR: thanks for explaining :)
[17:26] igl: you cannot "return" a function asyncronous
[17:27] boltR: so i would just have to handle stdout from the object returned by exec right?
[17:27] christoffe has joined the channel
[17:27] boltR: rather than inside it
[17:27] AndreasMadsen: You should do so something like: http://dpaste.com/674756/
[17:28] boltR: hmm interesting
[17:28] gflarity: boltr:  here's more likely how you want to do this http://dpaste.com/674758/
[17:29] AndreasMadsen: You can then use get_data(function (data) { /* use data */ });
[17:29] gflarity: good style, or rather accepted cannonical style is to have error be the first param of the callback
[17:30] boltR: so the parameter in both these cases is a function?
[17:30] fzzzy has joined the channel
[17:30] gflarity: yes
[17:30] gflarity: callback
[17:30] boltR: i.e. get_data?
[17:30] AndreasMadsen: You should use @gflarity if you do not want error error handling inside get_data.
[17:30] gflarity: get_data is function, on_result is also a function
[17:30] gflarity: (for my example, cb for Andreas')
[17:30] AndreasMadsen: Yes functions as parameter is a big part of JavaScript
[17:31] boltR: ah i see
[17:31] AndreasMadsen: It's the essence of async code
[17:32] boltR: okay i'll work with these examples

[20:11] Vespakoen: yeh well, they are tabs so if i configurate my IDE to use 2 or 4 or 8 spaces as a "tab" it should all be fine right ?

[20:14] Vespakoen: Anyone spot any structural problems in my code besides the uncool tab size =) ?
[20:17] lietu: tab = tab, I think the people who like to use space instead of tabs are the same people who still code in COBOL
[20:19] systemfault: What?
[20:19] systemfault: Stop smoking.
[20:19] systemfault: Tabs are for idiots.
[20:20] Dmitrijus: well, one word, expandtab
[20:20] lietu: your argument fails to convince me
[20:20] systemfault: Dmitrijus: I totally agree :)
[20:20] AndreasMadsen has joined the channel
[20:21] Vespakoen: so spaces VS tabs, interesting, can anyone convince me to use spaces?
[20:21] CarterL has joined the channel
[20:22] systemfault: lietu: Let's say that you make a fluent builder, you would like all the dots on their own line.. aligned with the first one.. With spaces, it works but with tabs, it depends on the settings of the editor..
[20:22] systemfault: Same thing for function arguments on more than a single line.
[20:22] lietu: so don't indent them in a way that depends on the tab length
[20:23] systemfault: The best is simply to use tabs.. but that the editor converts them to spaces seamlessly (like Dmitrijus said)
[20:23] Vespakoen: soft-tabs =)
[20:23] lietu: I only have bad experiences with that
[20:23] Dmitrijus: the problem with tabs is that it is next to impossible to control every programmer in a team to use the same settings
[20:23] Vespakoen: well, i dont like to put things on more lines, i also turn off word-wrap in every editor i get my hands on, i dont like the looks of it
[20:23] lietu: the point with tabs is that they shouldn't need to
[20:24] Vespakoen: i have a 17 inch screen, i can see pretty much all my code= P
[20:24] erichynds has joined the channel
[20:24] Vespakoen: 1900px i mean
[20:24] systemfault: lietu: Nicely written code doesn't fit on a 2/4/8chars grid.
[20:25] lietu: you don't have to spend a lot of time formatting it so all variable definitions align nicely ... I don't see why anyone would ... and that's pretty much the only reason anyone would want to use spaces instead of tabs
[20:26] swair has joined the channel
[20:26] Dmitrijus: lietu: well, personally, i don't mind tabs, as long as you dont
[20:26] lietu: the main point with tabs really is that anyone can just use whatever setting they prefer, be it tabs with width of 2, 4, 8 or 16
[20:26] systemfault: lietu: Because some people actually care about their craft.
[20:26] Dmitrijus: intermix them with spaces
[20:26] systemfault: Instead of spitting line of shitty code.
[20:26] systemfault: *lines
[20:27] insin: you don't have to spend a lot of time doing it if it's what you do first time
[20:27] lietu: lol ... well, I do care about my craft, and I care enough to know that aligning stuff is for graphical designers, not for programmers .. I make good code, well documented, etc., I do not have to think how it looks like  ;)
[20:27] systemfault: lietu: Bullshit.
[20:27] yozgrahame has joined the channel
[20:27] insin: your pattern-matching machine of a brain cares :)
[20:28] systemfault: If you care, you would write easy to read/understand code.

[20:28] lietu: sure, easy to read, easy to understand, that does NOT include "well aligned to look pretty"
[20:28] systemfault: Sure it does
[20:28] insin: it helps
[20:28] lietu: if the alignment actually serves a purpose, you can achieve it with tabs just fine
[20:28] swair: I have a old version of npm installed and i'm not able to unistall it either..it gives out errors for every single command : http://paste.ubuntu.com/773731
[20:28] swair: how do i uninstall?
[20:28] Dmitrijus: lietu: yep, you are right :)
[20:28] lietu: in 99.999% of the cases the developers just do it to avoid doing real work
[20:29] insin: unless they did it that way first time
[20:29] hipsters_ has joined the channel
[20:29] systemfault: That must be why most people suck at programming... They don't care.
[20:30] lietu: in my experience it's the other way around, they care, a lot, about the wrong things ... little one pixel errors, or aligning variables, instead of actually making code that works ;)
[20:30] systemfault: Then hire competent people.
