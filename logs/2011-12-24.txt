[06:27] ablegreen: well node.js is good for fast i/o operations right?
[06:27] ablegreen: what are some problems that node.js fix?
[06:27] andrew12: well that's a side effect of it being completely event-driven
[06:28] ablegreen: ah
[06:28] andrew12: it can easily handle thousands of connections
[06:28] ablegreen: yeah but if they are cpu bound then it's slow
[06:29] andrew12: it'll be as slow as anything else
[06:29] ablegreen: i read an article in which it's slower than python, etc.
[06:30] ablegreen: when it comes to cpu operations
[06:30] andrew12: then don't use it for cpu bound stuff :p
[06:30] andrew12: it's designed for network stuff
[06:31] andrew12: you don't have to use it for everything
[06:31] ablegreen: ah okay
[06:31] ablegreen: what are most people using it for?
[06:31] ablegreen: can you cite some real world examples
[06:31] andrew12: there's 4 right front and center on http://nodejs.org/
[06:31] andrew12: 5 if you include the example
[06:32] andrew12: well 6.. there's 2 examples :p
[06:32] ablegreen: those examples are just simple webservers
[06:32] ablegreen: i don't think people are creating hello world servers :P
[06:33] kurtzhong_ has joined the channel
[06:33] ablegreen: basically what i'm wondering is
[06:33] ablegreen: what makes node.js better than say python or something?
[06:33] hij1nx has joined the channel
[06:33] k1ttty has joined the channel
[06:34] Shaunzie: I wouldn't say node is better than python.
[06:34] Shaunzie: they are designed for two different purposes.
[06:34] Shaunzie: python is general purpose, but node is specifically targeted and doing network stuff asynchronously 
[06:34] andrew12: apples and oranges :)
[06:34] ablegreen: what are asynchronous connections?
[06:35] jaitaiwan has joined the channel
[06:35] Shaunzie: asynchronous = doing many things at the same time
[06:35] ablegreen: ah i see
[06:35] ablegreen: like...many operations at once?
[06:36] andrew12: like talking to two separate completely irrelevant to each-other sockets
[06:36] ablegreen: i see
[06:36] andrew12: (they can be relevant.. but that's just an example :p)
[06:36] ablegreen: gotcha
[06:36] a_meteorite: very much apples and oranges... node.js is a framework/library/software system/what-have-you, python is a language
[06:36] a_meteorite: python has its own async libs
[06:36] a_meteorite: h
[06:37] a_meteorite: o
[06:37] a_meteorite: 
[06:37] a_meteorite: howev
[06:37] a_meteorite: er
[06:37] ablegreen: how is that different from an apache server...it can handle multiple connections at once too, right?
[06:37] andrew12: right, but they're not as good at async stuff as node.. at least not in my experience
[06:37] a_meteorite: however, javascript's paradigm really suits the async model well
[06:37] andrew12: ablegreen: apache is a webserver, node is a platform for building network applications.
[06:37] a_meteorite: they're not. they don't perform as well and it just doesn't feel natural.
[06:38] andrew12: yeah
[06:38] andrew12: i played with network stuff in ruby for a while
[06:38] a_meteorite: and javascript is the language of the web, meaning it fits well for server apps for many reasons
[06:38] andrew12: IO.select is annoying.
[06:38] ablegreen: i see
[06:38] jesusabdullah: If you want to compare node to something pythonic, compare it to twisted
[06:38] jesusabdullah: except that twisted sucks balls
[06:38] ablegreen: or tornado
[06:38] andrew12: indeed
[06:38] ablegreen: twisted seems old and outdated
[06:39] ablegreen: what makes a web server "non-blocking"?
[06:39] a_meteorite: ablegreen: as for what is node good at... well, our little start-up is using it for everything
[06:40] ablegreen: i see
[06:40] a_meteorite: http://magnode.org/ is our biggest ambition probably (sorry, no usable releases yet), and our soon-to-launch IRC bouncing service (http://chat.bzfx.net/)
[06:41] brianseeders has joined the channel
[06:41] a_meteorite: and some other stuff, all node.js... we love it
[06:41] ablegreen: i see

[06:42] cognominal_ has joined the channel
[06:42] ablegreen: but
[06:42] ablegreen: how is it different from any other cms
[06:42] Shaunzie: developed using nodejs? :D
[06:43] a_meteorite: magnode? well, its main goal is semantic. data in, say, drupal is not semantic. and yeah, it's all node.js.
[06:43] Shaunzie: why did you put nginx in front of it though?
[06:43] ablegreen: ah okay
[06:43] Shaunzie: are you trying to avoid running node as root?
[06:43] a_meteorite: http://magnode.org/doc has lots of info
[06:44] andrew12: a_meteorite: just signed up for the irc bouncer beta :p
[06:44] a_meteorite: andrew12: awesome :) be awaret though, we won't be sending out any stuff for a few more weeks at least
[06:44] CarterL has joined the channel
[06:45] ablegreen: andrew12, what are you using node.js for?
[06:45] a_meteorite: Shaunzie: we like nginx, plus it lets us proxy to a cluster and whatnot.

[06:46] andrew12: and bitcoinjs
[06:46] vrs has joined the channel
[06:46] a_meteorite: we want to play with bitcoinjs more
[06:46] ablegreen: do you browse the darkweb
[06:46] andrew12: no
[06:46] vrs: can I somehow influence how deep console.log expands objects?
[06:47] a_meteorite: ablegreen: the darkweb? like freenet or tor?
[06:47] andrew12: vrs: i've wondered that... I usually just do something like console.log(JSON.stringify(object, null, 2)
[06:47] ablegreen: a_meteorite: yes
[06:47] andrew12: )
[06:48] andrew12: ablegreen: i've played with tor and i2p, but haven't really used them
[06:48] a_meteorite: I'm a supporter of tor, don't use it much though
[06:48] isufy has joined the channel
[06:48] andrew12: i have no need to use it :p
[06:48] ablegreen: same
[06:48] ablegreen: torrents are for amateurs
[06:48] ablegreen: :P
[06:48] andrew12: tor isn't bittorrent...
[06:48] Shaunzie: LOL!
[06:49] ablegreen: people use tor while torrenting
[06:49] andrew12: so?
[06:49] andrew12: the FBI uses tor too
[06:49] ablegreen: most people use tor for torrenting?
[06:49] ablegreen: yes?
[06:49] andrew12: nope
[06:49] ablegreen: what for then?
[06:50] andrew12: i don't know, it's anonymous
[06:50] ablegreen: you don't know...
[06:50] ablegreen: okay.
[06:50] ablegreen: lol
[06:50] zodiak: ablegreen, I use it to keep my browsing at work 'anonymous'/private
[06:50] a_meteorite: don't use tor for torrenting, please

[06:51] andrew12: good question
[06:51] Gekz: oh god

[06:52] andrew12: so much opinions
[06:52] Gekz: because now, he has achieved climax
[06:52] Gekz: and you all helped him 
[06:52] ablegreen: i just came
[06:52] andrew12: ._.
[06:52] Gekz: point proven.
[06:53] ablegreen: so gekz, what are you using node.js for?
[06:53] Gekz: who said I use node.js
[06:53] andrew12: ok now you're being creepy
[06:53] ablegreen: what are you here for then?
[06:53] Gekz: what does it matter to you sir
[06:54] Gekz: I'm a spy from the ruby corporation
[06:54] andrew12: lol
[06:54] Gekz: I'm here hellbent on destroying the node complex.
[06:54] a_meteorite: be gone with yourself!
[06:54] ablegreen: just curious what people are using node.js for
[06:54] ablegreen: i'm trying to find a reason to use it
[06:54] Gekz: why use a spoon
[06:55] Gekz: all cutlery is used for eating, yet we have like 50 different spoons for different meals
[06:55] andrew12: why are we on irc on christmas eve?
[06:55] andrew12: 'TIS THE SEASON
[06:55] Shaunzie: cause we are geekly
[06:55] Gekz: I already had sex today
[06:55] Gekz: so I'm waiting for a christmas party 
[06:55] Gekz: also I am making a font
[06:55] Shaunzie: having sex with yourself doesn't count -.-
[06:55] Gekz: fonts don't afraid of anything nor care for our concept of time.
[06:55] Gekz: Shaunzie: u jell
[06:55] Gekz: y
[06:55] a_meteorite: I will be here christmas day too
[06:55] ablegreen: gekz: i'm looking for specific reasons to use node.js
[06:56] a_meteorite: having nothing better to do does that
[06:56] Gekz: ablegreen: on a serious note, I'm yet to find a single reason 
[06:56] Gekz: I've used node.js, but I can't see any reason to use it other than "I am a webdev that knows only javascript and some PHP, might as well"
[06:56] Gekz: I have enough languages under my belt to not need node.js, and I'm yet to find a situation where it would make my life easier 
[06:57] Gekz: I haven't had to make anything highly asynchronous yet 
[06:57] a_meteorite: Gekz: then you're wrong. I know C++, Python, Ruby, Java, PHP.
[06:57] Gekz: but if I do, I'll probably use node
[06:57] context: Anyone know any good books for CouchDB or MongoDB that would be "similar" to the Riak Handbook. 
[06:57] a_meteorite: node.js makes not only async a joy, but IO/networking a bigger joy.
[06:57] Shaunzie: lets not start comparing cock sizesâ€¦ >.>
[06:57] Gekz: a_meteorite: I don't do either of those things very often 
[06:58] Gekz: the networking part, I'm yet to see evidence that it's easier than say, Python 
[06:58] Gekz: I'm willing to be proven wrong 
[06:58] context: Have sex or WebDAV?
[06:58] Gekz: context: almost always sex.
[06:58] context: Web dev*
[06:58] context: Shame. 
[06:58] Gekz: webdev can wait
[06:58] Gekz: people die.
[06:58] a_meteorite: *WebDAV

[07:01] Gekz: one of the main things stopping me from using node.js that I recall is that it doesnt have very nice support for XML documents 
[07:01] a_meteorite: Gekz: our start-up is making an IRC bouncing service using node http://chat.bzfx.net/
[07:01] a_meteorite: lots of IO and networking
[07:01] jesusabdullah: Gekz: look at isaac's sax parser
[07:01] jesusabdullah: I hear it's pretty boss
[07:01] Gekz: I don't need to parse
[07:01] Gekz: I need to build.
[07:02] jesusabdullah: That doesn't sound so hard
[07:02] andrew12: parsing sax.. kinky
[07:02] a_meteorite: there are plenty of other apps and libraries out there that are predisposed to node
[07:02] Gekz: it's harder than other languages 
[07:02] Gekz: a_meteorite: I dont see the code here
[07:02] andrew12: hard sax?
[07:02] Knifed_ has joined the channel
[07:02] a_meteorite: Gekz: yeah, you won't
[07:02] jesusabdullah: Basically, it's like this: Node doesn't have a big standard library, which means you're gonna have to go to userspace to get your xml tools
[07:02] context: MongoDB the definitive guide. Anyone read that?
[07:02] jesusabdullah: but that's okay!
[07:02] p6 has joined the channel
[07:02] jesusabdullah: Because chances are there is at least one half-decent library out there that'll do what you want
[07:02] Gekz: then your link is useless to me, because I'm asking for an example of the _code_
[07:02] Gekz: I care little for your product 
[07:03] a_meteorite: Gekz: you asked for an example, next time be more specific :)
[07:03] dwhittle has joined the channel

[07:03] Gekz: we're in a coding channel on freenode.
[07:03] context: Wait. Stop feeding the trolls
[07:03] Gekz: jesusabdullah: io and networking code in javascript
[07:04] a_meteorite: Gekz: there are plenty of other apps and libraries out there that are predisposed to node
[07:04] context: Gekz: Then why are you here?
[07:04] Gekz: context: clearly discussing coding 
[07:04] ablegreen: what's the difference between asynchronous IO and multithreading?
[07:04] jesusabdullah: Gekz: There are a lot of people that come here asking for examples of "real world" usage as proof that node isn't some really obscure thing that makes itself sound less so
[07:04] jesusabdullah: Does that make sense?
[07:04] context: It sounds like you want proof of why you should use node
[07:04] Gekz: jesusabdullah: I'm not asking for that reason though
[07:04] Gekz: I'm trying to see how it's meant to be used 
[07:04] context: If you dont want to use it then dont use it
[07:04] jesusabdullah: Gekz: But oyu can see why someone would think maybe you did?
[07:04] Gekz: yes, I can
[07:05] jesusabdullah: groovy
[07:05] Gekz: I'm not asking for the why
[07:05] Gekz: I'm asking for the how 
[07:05] a_meteorite: express framework
[07:05] a_meteorite: mongodb drivers
[07:05] Gekz: I want to know how using node can improve my workflow
[07:05] Gekz: syntactically.
[07:05] a_meteorite: there are lots of cool libs out there
[07:05] paera has joined the channel
[07:05] a_meteorite: google is your friend
[07:05] context: Gekz: Why not just play with it? Spend this weekend and write something in it and see if you like it?
[07:05] jesusabdullah: How about a full open-source app, guys?
[07:06] Shaunzie: @ablegreen http://tinyurl.com/76eoejk
[07:06] Gekz: context: I've written multiple programs in it actually
[07:06] context: We can argue for the rest of our lives why node is good or bad. In the end it's still a bunch of retards arguing instead of getting anything done 
[07:06] Gekz: I'm not arguing about whether it's good or bad you douchebag
[07:06] Gekz: I think it is good.
[07:06] ablegreen: we're not arguing why node is bad...
[07:06] Gekz: I just haven't seen how I can use it properly. 
[07:06] jesusabdullah: Gekz: fwiw here's a little app I wrote https://github.com/jesusabdullah/DNSlookup/blob/master/bin/server
[07:06] ablegreen: we're wondering why it's being used....
[07:07] jesusabdullah: Gekz: live site at http://dnslookup.nodejitsu.com
[07:07] Gekz: jesusabdullah: github didn't want to syntax highlight
[07:07] Gekz: this gives me a sad
[07:07] context: Gekz: Then the best way for that is to probably look at other libraries and open source apps 
[07:07] Gekz: context: which is why I'm here, asking for _good_ examples
[07:07] jesusabdullah: Gekz: It's cause there's no extension
[07:07] a_meteorite: Gekz: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Projects,-Applications,-and-Companies-Using-Node
[07:07] Gekz: jesusabdullah: just noticed.
[07:07] jesusabdullah: Yeah
[07:08] a_meteorite: There you go. Lots of cool stuff there.
[07:08] jesusabdullah: I'm trying to think of some REALLY COOL, polished OSS project that uses node
[07:08] Gekz: / Trim off http:// cause I think people will do this
[07:08] Gekz: haha
[07:08] jesusabdullah: s/project/webapp
[07:08] Gekz: they always bloody do jesusabdullah
[07:08] jesusabdullah: there are TONS of libraries
[07:08] Gekz: or add extra slashes
[07:08] jesusabdullah: tons and tons and tons
[07:08] context: Gekz: If you didn't get any right away than no one knows of any off the top of their head or don't want to google for you
[07:08] lwille has joined the channel
[07:08] jesusabdullah: but a lot of the apps are closed source because, I mean, that's our business model y'know?
[07:08] Gekz: context: your vagina is so very loud, relax.
[07:08] ablegreen: that site doesn't explain why they are using nodejs as opposed to alternatives a_meteorite
[07:08] jesusabdullah: But yeah, I'd suggest looking at express
[07:08] context: Heh
[07:09] jesusabdullah: Whoa now, no trollin'
[07:09] jesusabdullah: keep it civil
[07:09] jesusabdullah: à² _à² 
[07:09] context: Express. And railways.js
[07:09] a_meteorite: ablegreen: that's not the point of the list
[07:09] jesusabdullah: Oh, Gekz, check out this project: https://github.com/hookio
[07:09] jesusabdullah: Each of the hooks are self-contained servers :)
[07:09] context: Gekz: I think the best way to improve your workflow is to find libs that jive with your style of workflow. And combining them 
[07:10] Gekz: ooh event emitter
[07:10] context: Express is the most obvious choice. Find an MVC framework you like. A messaging lib. Etc etc
[07:10] Gekz: this amuses me 
[07:12] Gekz: I'm not looking for a web framework.
[07:12] ablegreen: why use express when you have asp.net, django, etc.
[07:12] context: Hi. Examples. 
[07:12] Gekz: ablegreen: well, asp.net is commercial.
[07:12] ablegreen: oh right. mvc's in javascript
[07:12] ablegreen: i get it
[07:13] Shaunzie: o.o
[07:13] a_meteorite: ablegreen: javascript on the server, the same language as the client, can be quite advantageous
[07:13] Gekz: so I guess the thing that node does better than most alternatives is its handling of async 
[07:13] ablegreen: agreed
[07:13] sreeix has joined the channel
[07:14] context: Im so confused right now. 
[07:14] AAA_awright: What are the "alternatives"?
[07:14] context: You have written a few apps in node and haven't read the API docs enough to know what event emitter is?
[07:14] idiotic_idioms has joined the channel
[07:15] AAA_awright: PHP isn't just a scripting language, it also ships with a large set of libraries for using the filesystem and whatnot. Javascript has no such functions, Node.js provides those.
[07:15] Shaunzie: I've written a couple apps in node and have read more than 20% of the documentation :D
[07:15] AAA_awright: READ ALL THE DOCUMENTATION
[07:15] context: ablegreen: why use django or asp.net when you have grails and rails and j2ee and seaside and catalyst and etc etc etc
[07:15] a_meteorite: Shaunzie: 20%? Um
[07:15] Shaunzie: PHP = annoying pos >.>
[07:15] a_meteorite: The docs is not that much, read it all
[07:15] jesusabdullah: 20% is a start guys, don't be hatin'
[07:15] ablegreen: context: because i like python more than java?
[07:16] a_meteorite: Really, the docs are a work of art
[07:16] idiotic__ has joined the channel

[07:16] jesusabdullah: that's hard to do, man!
[07:16] ablegreen: aaa_awright: thank you, you just provided the clearest answer here so far
[07:16] context: ablegreen: I was trying to point out the total absurdity of our comment.

[07:44] clarkfischer: "something" on building large applications with it?

[07:57] andrew12: that's not what i'm saying
[07:57] andrew12: when you see function blarg() {
[07:57] andrew12: it's not obvious that that is a constructor, and that you're supposed to do new blarg() rather than just blarg()

[08:12] deoxxa: jya jyaaaan
[08:13] clarkfischer: And I'm not even sure of a case where that would be applicable
[08:13] disappearedng: well cause I am a rails developer
[08:13] disappearedng: and I want to do a little project that invovles a lot of real time stuff
[08:13] zodiak: disappearedng, yes, basically, build a json API in node and asset pipeline/html/etc in rails
[08:13] disappearedng: and fyi rails is not exactly good for this 
[08:13] disappearedng: oh ok cool yeah that was what I was asking then 
[08:13] deoxxa: s/this$/anything/
[08:14] zodiak: disappearedng, totally do-able, and the API scales better than the rails side ;)
[08:14] Shaunzie: node.js was birthed out of Ryhan Dahl's annoyance/hatred for Ruby and Railsâ€¦ 
[08:14] mowen has joined the channel
[08:14] disappearedng: ok then where does the business logic go then? 
[08:14] zodiak: disappearedng, into the node side
[08:14] dubenstein has joined the channel
[08:14] disappearedng: does it go to node.js or stays inside rails? like don't I need an engine for something like that then? 
[08:15] deoxxa: actually, at work we have a PHP/node setup
[08:15] Shaunzie: waitâ€¦ huh?
[08:15] zodiak: engine ? no, the rails does (almost) everything across the API

[08:16] disappearedng: so all the business logic stays inside node but rails just serves the page
[08:16] deoxxa: Shaunzie: you and me both, man
[08:16] Shaunzie: mostly cause of the Zend Framework ....
[08:16] zodiak: disappearedng, yup, and all the assets etc.
[08:16] deoxxa: actually, Symfony2 makes PHP not so bad
[08:16] disappearedng: best book about node.js/ 
[08:16] Shaunzie: The Zend Framework robbed me of my innocenceâ€¦ I've been violated ._.
[08:16] zodiak: deoxxa, kinda like saying pencillin makes the clap 'not so bad' 
[08:17] deoxxa: and Shaunzie, ZF as a framework is awful, but as a collection of libraries it's at times kind of useful
[08:17] deoxxa: zodiak: what, scratching is kind of satisfying sometimes
[08:17] deoxxa: you know like when you have a mosquito bite or something
[08:17] zodiak: disappearedng, there are a lot of free books out there.. it's pretty easy to pickup if you know jquery/prototype
[08:18] zodiak: deoxxa, sounds like a plan .. the scratching part that is ;)

[08:18] Shaunzie: @disappearedng there aren't a lot of books for node yet. It's still too new, but there are a lot of books that explain how to develop using Javascript.
[08:18] Shaunzie: like the internals of Javascript how shit works and such
[08:19] dubenstein has joined the channel
[08:19] deoxxa: disappearedng: i started by messing about with the built-in libraries for HTTP doing silly web scraping stuff, it took about half an hour of playing with it before i "got" how it worked (having done nearly no JS before)
[08:20] disappearedng: yeah actually I wanted to go node for a long time
[08:20] disappearedng: now that I am doing real time app 
[08:20] deoxxa: disappearedng: so you might want to just put aside a couple of hours on a weekend (or holidays that you hopefully have!) to play with it
[08:20] disappearedng: yup this holiday =) 
[08:20] deoxxa: \o/

[15:52] megalomix: Lingerance, https://gist.github.com/1517587 someting like that?
[15:53] siddhion: when I do define a variable like `var a = 5;` in the node REPL, the next line that is printed reads `undefined`. Then when I do `a` I get `5` on the next line. Finally, when I do `.clear` and then do `a` I still get `5`. How come I am seeing `undefined`? And why does `.clear` not clear the context like it should?
[15:54] Lingerance: o = [{class: 'first', url: '/', text: 'aaa'}, {class: 'second', url: 'bbb.html', text: 'bbb'}, {class: 'third', url: 'ccc.html', text: 'ccc'}, {class: 'fourth', url: 'ddd.html', text: 'ddd'}]

[15:54] Lingerance: megalomix: ^
[15:54] tbranyen: siddhion: that happens in all javascript repls
[15:55] megalomix: yes
[15:55] megalomix: i try
[15:55] swhit: pilgo: if cherokee is running on port 80 you won't be able to bind it from node too
[15:55] siddhion: tbranyen, the printing of `undefined`? or `.clear` not clearing the context like it should?
[15:55] tbranyen: siddhion: clear() should never clear context
[15:55] tbranyen: and the printing of undefined happens everywhere, yes
[15:55] pilgo: swhit: Right, right, so I'm just trying to figure out a way to do it
[15:56] swhit: pilgo: run node on a different port? or proxy the connection (nginx, haproxy)?
[15:56] kriszyp has joined the channel
[15:56] pilgo: swhit: I'm thinking it may be easier to run node on a different port
[15:57] siddhion: tbranyen, ok because I am following a tutorial video where the tutor does `.clear` and then tries to see if the variable still exists and it does not. He gets a ReferenceError
[15:57] tbranyen: .clear on what?
[15:57] siddhion: tbranyen, he is using node v0.4.5
[15:57] tbranyen: oh
[15:58] siddhion: tbranyen, when you are in the REPL, you define a variable and then run `.clear` to clear that variable from memory.
[15:58] siddhion: tbranyen, that is what he did and it worked. i don't know why it is not working for me.

[16:31] siddhion: andrew12, thanks. now should I uninstall 0.7.0-pre first?
[16:31] andrew12: probably

[17:55] marcello3d: cleaning up the output and I'll post a gist
[17:55] marcello3d: and the benchmarks
[17:55] Lingerance: Is it one of those ORM-crap things?
[17:56] RLa: Lingerance, any idea why it puts undefined on the last line
[17:56] Lingerance: If not I'll probably look into switching to it.
[17:56] marcello3d: no
[17:56] Lingerance: RLa: because console.log() doesn't return anthing
[17:56] RLa: oh, i get it
[17:56] marcello3d: it's an alternative to mongodb-native
[17:56] Lingerance: Excellent
[17:56] marcello3d: but right now I'm just benchmarking the raw serialization/deserialization
[17:56] RLa: heh, i'm still not getting doc-oriented database
[17:57] RLa: isn't there very few apps where you can use them
[17:57] Lingerance: ACTION uses them to store files
[17:58] marcello3d: Lingerance: look here: https://github.com/marcello3d/node-mongolian
[17:58] marcello3d: Lingerance: the master branch is still using mongodb-native for the serialization/deserialization, but all the connection and command logic is written from scratch
[17:58] Lingerance: Oh, cool
[17:59] marcello3d: Lingerance: the buffalo branch is using my new serialization/deserialization code from https://github.com/marcello3d/node-buffalo
[17:59] Lingerance: ReplicaSet support?
[17:59] marcello3d: yes
[17:59] marcello3d: main thing it doesn't have yet is connection pooling
[18:00] marcello3d: which also means no things like slaveOk requests yet
[18:00] Lingerance: You need a connection pool to handle being disconnected from the master right?
[18:01] Lingerance: Right now that's an issue I'm having
[18:01] marcello3d: no
[18:01] marcello3d: connection is pool is for performance
[18:01] marcello3d: because the server uses single threads per connection
[18:03] marcello3d: it'll all come eventually, but no promises are being made :)
[18:03] Lingerance: So you have auto-reconnect working then?
[18:04] marcello3d: yes
[18:04] Lingerance: Sold.
[18:04] marcello3d: it generally connects on demand, but it will reconnect if it sees a connection loss
[18:04] marcello3d: though there are lots of weird edges cases around that, so it'd be nice to have a proper test framework to ensure it's working right

[19:53] Brandon_R: so
[19:53] Shaunzie: erlang is oldâ€¦ like 20 years old or something like that...
[19:53] Brandon_R: write the code in c++ and write a binder to it in node?

[19:54] Brandon_R: i always wonder
[19:54] Shaunzie: http://www.erlang.org/course/history.html
[19:54] Brandon_R: why does these new languages not perform well in computational apps?
[19:54] Brandon_R: aren't they written on top of c/c++ so the performance should be the same

[19:56] Brandon_R: i need to get a foundation in theoretical foundations more
[19:56] Shaunzie: O.o
[19:56] Brandon_R: like data structures, and big o notations etc
[19:56] gkatsev: wikipedia is your friend

[19:56] Shaunzie: gkatsev: +1
[19:57] Brandon_R: youtube has plenty of videos on this
[19:57] Brandon_R: from random people to professors at mit and stanford explaining it lol
[19:57] Brandon_R: anyone here "real" computer scientists?
[19:57] Brandon_R: like knows the theorye tc
[19:58] jaitaiwan has joined the channel
[19:59] insin: I have a Diploma in the Theorye of "Real" Computer Science right here
[19:59] gkatsev: I'm going to graduate with a BS in CS next year.
[19:59] Shaunzie: Mehâ€¦ I dropped out after taking all the fun classes
[19:59] gkatsev: heh
[19:59] Shaunzie: Who needs school when you have iTunesU
[19:59] Shaunzie: wooo that rhymed O.o
[19:59] blueadept`: ^
[19:59] Brandon_R: lol
[20:00] blueadept`: CS is very distributed these days
[20:00] Brandon_R: it's weird because you take the boring classes first
[20:00] zezikaro has left the channel
[20:00] Shaunzie: I'm making a tshirt stat!
[20:00] Shaunzie: @Brandon_R not always. My intro to CS classes were pretty fun cause the professor was awesome
[20:00] blueadept`: in what other industry can you watch youtube videos and practically become a full fledged expert in your field?
[20:00] gkatsev: same
[20:01] blueadept`: its sort of the only industry you can do it in
[20:01] Shaunzie: @blueadept` porn?
[20:01] blueadept`: ^ 
[20:01] blueadept`: that as well
[20:01] blueadept`: good point
[20:01] Shaunzie: :D
[20:01] gkatsev: stanford's online courses are great. and MIT is going to do MITx
[20:02] Shaunzie: yah in a few years you'll probably be able to just take all your degree on line, and pay a university to give you a degree x3 I'll wait for that
[20:02] blueadept`: Brandon_R: you doing a lot of machine learning, statistical analysis type stuff?
[20:02] Brandon_R: nope
[20:02] Brandon_R: physics/mathematics
[20:02] blueadept`: hardcore
[20:02] Brandon_R: i just come on here because i like node
[20:02] bbenvie: ever seen iTunesU
[20:02] boltR has joined the channel
[20:02] Brandon_R: i don't have itunes
[20:02] bbenvie: well it's free
[20:02] bbenvie: as is iTunesU
[20:02] Brandon_R: mit opensourceware is pretty cool
[20:03] bbenvie: you can already get the education you would in a university you just don't get the degree
[20:03] bbenvie: yeah it's basically all those types of thigns collected in one spot
[20:03] bbenvie: standford, mit, etc.
[20:03] Brandon_R: if i put mit/stanford/harvard online material together, i could get a real good foundation in physics before i go to college
[20:03] bbenvie: you have to pay the cash to get the piece of paper
[20:03] bbenvie: but you can learn all you want
[20:03] blueadept`: well degrees are a social singal, it will be interesting to see what other social signals emerge from the internet as we go forward
[20:03] Brandon_R: yep
[20:03] Brandon_R: with khancademy etc
[20:03] blueadept`: stackoverflow is a good signal for techical adeptness
[20:03] Brandon_R: this will have to change
[20:04] blueadept`: khan as well
[20:04] Shaunzie: Yahâ€¦ I know of a guy who managed to skip his undergrad and get a PHDâ€¦ luck bastard >.<

[20:04] Brandon_R: maybe make schools more research based and learn material at home
[20:04] Shaunzie: I still don't know how he did it ._.
[20:04] bbenvie: yeah I consider github and stackoverflow as the more important bits I include in a resume
[20:04] Brandon_R: research + tests in school, learn the stuff at home
[20:04] blueadept`: github go me my current job
[20:04] blueadept`: no hr bs, just right to the source
[20:04] Brandon_R: what university did u go to?
[20:05] blueadept`: me? 
[20:05] blueadept`: didn't graduate here buddy
[20:05] blueadept`: i got not time for debt
[20:05] bbenvie: github keeps track of exactly what YOU did, and makes it easy to look through it. Stackoverflow shows exactly what YOU are able to write
[20:05] blueadept`: debt is for the birds
[20:05] bbenvie: a degree is an amorphous non-specific thing
[20:05] blueadept`: ^
[20:06] blueadept`: i'm going back to school though, going to get something out of my comfort range
[20:06] blueadept`: in the mean time I can pay for my schooling with my job! imagine that
[20:06] bbenvie: companies talk about how it's hard to judge say a newly minted gradute
[20:06] bbenvie: or even many hires, it's hard to see
[20:06] bbenvie: because you have no way to see their actual capability, just a general potential
[20:07] blueadept`: stackoverflow/github is the clearly the future
[20:07] blueadept`: open source commits
[20:07] bbenvie: yeah
[20:07] blueadept`: stuff like that
[20:07] systemfault: Yes and no..
[20:07] mmalecki: github++
[20:07] systemfault: I did a lot of personal projects in my life... none of them are on github.
[20:08] Brandon_R: hey guys
[20:08] systemfault: And I don't waste my life on SO
[20:08] bbenvie: for programming absolutely, this type of job is one that can be tracked to an extremely specific point and people who can provide that are going to be much easier to judge and more desirable
[20:08] systemfault: Hiring people is always a hit or miss..
[20:08] bbenvie: if you're ever at a point where you're being compred to someone else
[20:08] bbenvie: then that stuff is the factor
[20:09] mmalecki: I got hired via pull requests
[20:09] systemfault: Some of the best people I've hired don't have "loud mouths" and are not overselling themselves.
[20:09] mmalecki: got few e-mails because of my github account
[20:09] bbenvie: a while back I realized that. I had done the same stuff, had a ton of personal projects that were cool and would impress but they were locked away somewhere
[20:09] mmalecki: it's definitely a win.

[20:14] Brandon_R: what did you major in?
[20:14] tbranyen: IT with concentrations in web dev and databases i think
[20:14] tbranyen: in hindsight CS would have been more useful

[20:29] TheFuzzball: Semantic HTML + CSS can be a pleasure, you just have to know what you're doing.
[20:30] TheFuzzball: If you're trying to use HTML for style you're up shit creek.
[20:30] Brandon_R: can you guys clone facebook timeline?
[20:30] Shaunzie: It's not so much styling as it's cleanly separating display and business logic
[20:30] Brandon_R: that looks like some pretty serious html
[20:30] systemfault: semantic html rocks because it makes styling easier :P
[20:31] tbone_ has joined the channel
[20:31] TheFuzzball: It also makes reading the HTML easier :)

[20:34] Shaunzie: erâ€¦ no
[20:34] Brandon_R: it's easier to stalk people on facebook than google
[20:34] Shaunzie: My boss is a she and she programs better than meâ€¦ and that rhymed again

[20:36] systemfault: Sorella_: I'm somehow trolling...
[20:36] systemfault: Sorella_: Still, there's a voice in my head telling me that there's no genius female programmer :(
[20:36] TheFuzzball: Someone name 3 women that have contributed massively to technology. Go.
[20:37] Brandon_R: can girls program?
[20:37] Sorella_: Me.
[20:37] systemfault: TheFuzzball: Liskov, ADA... I don't know :/
[20:37] Shaunzie: um Ada 
[20:37] Sorella_: And iunno.
[20:37] Brandon_R: did you guys see the girl that interviewed pquerna on vimeo?>

[20:40] Brandon_R: same here
[20:40] Brandon_R: what do you mean by hands?
[20:40] systemfault: Shaunzie: Good.
[20:40] Brandon_R: masterbating or work?
[20:40] systemfault: Both?
[20:40] systemfault: :/
[20:40] TheFuzzball: Masturbating can be work, I suppose...
[20:40] Brandon_R: is ryah going out with anyone?
[20:40] Shaunzie: scientifically speaking, masterbating is working
[20:40] Shaunzie: >.>
[20:40] Brandon_R: work is force times distance
[20:41] Brandon_R: there is no net distance
[20:41] Brandon_R: since youa re going up and down
[20:41] TheFuzzball: Distance is low, so not that much work.
[20:41] Brandon_R: so there is no work
[20:41] pauls1: Brandon_R: i don't think that's correct
[20:42] pauls1: Brandon_R: because work talks about the point of application of force
[20:42] pauls1: which changes when you're spanking the monkey
[20:42] Brandon_R: ik
[20:42] Brandon_R: it's technically force dot distance
[20:42] Brandon_R: D*F*cosx

[20:50] pauls1: means people buy more and we get bonuses ;P
[20:50] mmalecki: :D
[20:50] mmalecki: gifts!
[20:51] systemfault: True.
[20:51] tbranyen: the way i see gifting: "If you bought a gift for someone, its probably because you're making up for treating them like shit all year"

[20:51] Dmitrijus: tbranyen: so what? better to at least try to make up than just treating them like shit all year :)
[20:51] TheFuzzball: Christmas wasn't anything to do with Christianity in the first place anyway, it was hijacked by Christians to move the pagans to Christianity.
[20:52] systemfault: Hmm
[20:52] pauls1: like Jesus' teaching was hijacked by the church..
[20:52] pauls1: which no longer has his teaching..
[20:52] TheFuzzball: Which is why it's understandable that "Christmas" isn't about God anymore, it's about consumerism.
[20:52] systemfault: TheFuzzball: Then Jesus's birth isn't celebrated on dec 25th?
[20:52] Sorella_: TheFuzzball, heh, it has never been about God :3
[20:52] Dmitrijus: ;]

[21:11] mmalecki: Brandon_R: uhm, 5 months and 1 year?
[21:11] tbranyen: CarterL: +1
[21:12] Brandon_R: 1 year, about 4 months
[21:13] mmalecki: but it's impossible? or I derped at maths
[21:13] Lingerance: So... you had conception a few days after the last one came out?
[21:14] tbranyen: a christmas miracle
[21:14] TheFuzzball: Orâ€¦ He's just had his kids before getting married.
[21:14] Lingerance: What?
[21:15] kristsk: impossibru!
[21:15] Lingerance: I'm talking about the 1y4m + 5m children's age difference

[21:22] Tom____: I have a simple Java program that reads from stdin and outputs to stdout, but how do I make node write to its stdin before it closes? See https://gist.github.com/1518382 for both java and node.js code.
[21:23] Lingerance: child_process
[21:24] rurufufuss has joined the channel
[21:24] Tom____: Lingerance:  did you even look at my code?
[21:24] Lingerance: My browser is slow right now, I answered the question as it was phrased
[21:24] cclarke has joined the channel
[21:25] Brandon_R: sockets
[21:25] Tom____: Lingerance: ah well, you'll see from the code that I am using child processes. 
[21:25] tab1293 has joined the channel
[21:25] Tom____: When I run it the child process simply closes and so does the node app, with an empty return.
[21:25] Lingerance: So, child.write() isn't doing anything?
[21:26] Tom____: Lingerance: I don't know, any way to test?
[21:26] Tom____: Lingerance:  I am using child.stdin.write, not child.write
[21:28] Lingerance: Tom____: Because the program doesn't exist in the path (I'm fairly certain)
[21:28] tab1293: does this look like valid JSON? http://pastebin.com/Eukz5CUQ
[21:29] Lingerance: You want to give it java as the command, the rest of that stuff should be .split(' ') into args (the second param)
[21:29] maxogden: tab1293: you can test by pasting it into chrome developer tools console
[21:29] Lingerance: Tom____: That looks valid
[21:30] Lingerance: JSON.parse() handles it just fine
[21:30] Tom____: Lingerance: Ok, I added them as args. Interestingly enough the program now does not quit, and keeps running forever -- but there is no output either.
[21:31] cclarke has joined the channel
[21:31] Tom____: I updated the gist.
[21:32] Lingerance: Does the Java program expect an EOL?
[21:32] Tom____: Lingerance: not really sure, did you see https://gist.github.com/1518382 ?

[21:32] Skaag has joined the channel
[21:33] Lingerance: Yeah
[21:35] Tom____: Lingerance: I'm not sure to be honest, I am not experienced with Java. I only created this simple Java command line interface to interact with node.js
[21:36] Lingerance: Try closing child.stdin when the write has been completely
[21:36] Lingerance: completed*
[21:36] benop has joined the channel
[21:37] Tom____: Lingerance: that makes the child terminate, and no output is returned
[21:37] Lingerance: ... you just added one line after the .write() didn't you?
[21:38] Lingerance: If so "when the write has been completed" is the important bit.
[21:38] Tom____: Lingerance:  I added child.stdin.once('drain', function() {         child.stdin.end();     });
[21:38] cclarke has joined the channel
[21:39] AAA_awright: Is there an efficent, non-cryptographic hash library that ships with Node.js?
[21:39] Lingerance: Confirmed that this doesn't fire before .write() happens?
[21:39] AAA_awright: Or am I gonna have to use MD5
[21:39] Lingerance: No.
[21:39] Lingerance: BTW, MD5 is cryptographic
[21:40] Tom____: Lingerance: yes, because the attachment is after .write

[21:47] andrew12: hmm.. what was that windows code editor that looked like awesome?
[21:47] RLa: Tom____, why not create web service on java side and use it?
[21:47] Lingerance: pnotepad
[21:47] andrew12: no
[21:47] Tom____: RLa: because I don't know how to create a web service with java, whereas a command line utility should be simple

[22:42] TheMoonMaster: Why not?
[22:42] TheMoonMaster: Not for the whole package, just for a single instance.

[22:44] TheMoonMaster: Why would it be better to extend the class?
[22:44] Lingerance: Actually, what I just pasted won't have the correct value for "this"
[22:45] Lingerance: Because it's proper OOP?
