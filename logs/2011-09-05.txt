[03:07] Nuck: Will they work on the new Windows node.exe?
[03:08] isaacs: Nuck: not likely, not for a while
[03:08] Daegalus: the only downside to windows support is CMD is HORRIBLE, makes me rage so much
[03:08] Nuck: :'(
[03:08] Nuck: Daegalus: Agreed
[03:08] Daegalus: I should technically start using PowerShell
[03:08] Nuck: isaacs: You should set up building servers for all the addons to work on Windows :P
[03:08] Daegalus: its closer to linux

[03:10] Daegalus: looks*
[03:10] Nuck: Daegalus: I'm probably gonna set one up for myself
[03:10] Daegalus: ya, but see the downside is it says anyone can hope in and watch you code
[03:10] Daegalus: i dont like that

[03:11] Nuck: Daegalus: Not a private project
[03:11] Nuck: Yeah
[03:12] Daegalus: i meant the free version
[03:12] Nuck: But I assume the open source one lacks that :P
[03:12] Nuck: And if not, I can cut that chunk out :P
[03:12] Daegalus: free version is no private projs, or anything
[03:12] Daegalus: what do you mean cut that chunk out?
[03:12] Nuck: the public chunk
[03:12] RichardNode: 15 bucks a mo for premium isn't that bad
[03:12] Nuck: I can rip it out
[03:12] Nuck: If I must
[03:12] Nuck: RichardNode: Yeah, but I'm a cheapskate
[03:12] RichardNode: I earn 15 bucks at work making coffee :P

[03:13] Nuck: I set up Gitolite just so I wouldn't have to buy a Github premium account

[03:20] Nuck: isaacs: Agreed, but I'm waiting for that to startup
[03:20] Nuck: Windows dun crashed earlier
[03:20] Nuck: Chrome is the new Firefox
[03:20] meatmanek: nuck: it takes up all my memory? yeah
[03:21] isaacs: Nuck: get a proper web browser.  chrome is the fastest on osx and linux
[03:21] Nuck: isaacs: Sure is, it's also best on Windows.
[03:21] Nuck: That's why I use it.
[03:21] Nuck: I switched from Firefox almost half a year ago
[03:21] isaacs: oh, i see
[03:21] isaacs: i thot you were disparaging it, with the "new firefox" comment ;P
[03:21] Nuck: I just switched all my icons and set it as my default browser about a month ago tho
[03:22] Nuck: isaacs: Nah, don't you remember when Firefox was So Amazing?
[03:22] Nuck: you know, pre-4.0
[03:22] isaacs: yeah, like around 1.0 or so
[03:22] meatmanek: nuck: you mean 1.5?
[03:22] Nuck: 4.0 was a nice drop-off point
[03:22] Nuck: Suddenly, thing started crashing more and more

[03:49] matyr has joined the channel
[03:49] Nexxy: Daegalus, you're going to get 6 different answers to that ;P
[03:49] Nexxy: (give or take)
[03:49] Daegalus: So pretty much all 6 different MongoDB implementations?
[03:50] Nexxy: well mongoose has cool schemas
[03:51] blkcat: i would recommend mongoose
[03:51] Nexxy: and you can always fall back to plain mongo
[03:51] blkcat: 1.x was pretty rocky to say the least but mongoose 2 looks pretty solid.
[03:51] Nexxy: I agree w/ blkcat 
[03:51] Nexxy: not that I've used it extensively

[03:53] Daegalus: Well, I like to get opinions of people that have probably worked with this a bit. Im a node.js noob. I will choose on my own, but I like to get opinions on what more seasoned developers choose and why

[03:54] blkcat: Daegalus: well, i can't speak for any of the other layers but i've used mongoose in production
[03:55] blkcat: Daegalus: but if you don't think you need the plugins, schemas, validators etc. etc. then mongodb-native is fine - simple and well-designed
[03:55] Guest43583: personally I prefer mongodb-native, it suits me better (I wasn't looking for something that has schemas or tries to be an ORM)
[03:55] c4milo1 has joined the channel
[03:55] blkcat: yeah, it really just comes down to whether you want the orm or not
[03:55] Guest43583: (argh, cursed forgetting to auth and forced name change)
[03:55] mecablaze: I am writing a build script for my website (flattening js, css, etc). I am nesting async.parallel to perform sets of tasks that can be executed concurrently. The way I am passing information from one "layer" to another (the callback of one async.paralell contains another async.paralell, etc etc) is by basically having file-wide globals declared for every variable i need to pass down. this 
[03:55] abraxas has joined the channel

As far as I can tell, the only way I can do this asynchronously is by using the callbacks, but my roadblock is how to get the dynamic name into the callback.

[05:26] chjj: cygwin works from what ive seen, as long as it gets the job done
[05:26] Daegalus: tbranyen: not really, I play most games in it, it works same speed, if not faster.
[05:26] nXqd: Daegalus: I don't think it will work with garena + warcraft III :)
[05:26] snowinferno: Any ideas what would cause a large delay in a file write and the callback being executed?
[05:27] nXqd: Daegalus: faster ? really ? I don't think it will be faster than in windows :)
[05:27] nXqd: <offtopic, I think I will stop here > 
[05:27] chjj: are we talking about wine now?
[05:27] Daegalus: nXqd: it can, and is at times. I have games that jsut work better. And I know WC3 works, not sure what garena is

[05:30] nXqd: Daegalus: really thanks you for that information. I'm gonna try it after lunch :d

[06:46] godzirra: Anyone have any ideas about my mongodb issue? :)
[06:46] jesusabdullah: So, I'm trying to port the couchdb views engine to node, and it hasn't been too bad so far but I'm starting to come up against a thing
[06:47] jesusabdullah: Basically: Should I start bringing in mad dependencies, or keep it barebones?

[06:47] jesusabdullah: I was thinking about rewriting the logging system to use forever, for example
[06:47] jesusabdullah: good or bad idea
[06:47] jetienne_: barebone
[06:48] jetienne_: if you want it to be used i mean :)
[06:48] jesusabdullah: How come?
[06:48] jesusabdullah: I don't necessarily disagree of course
[06:48] jetienne_: the more deps you add, the less it gonna be sustainable
[06:48] Nuck: OH GOD MY IPHONE HAS TITANIC'D
[06:48] Nuck: No, seriously, it's syncing.
[06:48] jetienne_: and people likes their code to be sustainable :)
[06:49] jesusabdullah: Well, I'm not too worried about sustainability
[06:49] jetienne_: 'do one thing and do it well' 
[06:49] jetienne_: if you dont care if it gonna be used or not
[06:49] jetienne_: just do as you wish, nobody will complain :)

[06:51] chjj: jesusabdullah: my philosophy is, if your module is a library of some kind, ideally try to have no dependencies
[06:52] jetienne_: it is something you depends on, it goes down, you go down

[06:53] godzirra: I'm connecting to my mongodb in my node.js code like so: mongodb://localhost/test.  My question, is using the mongodb command line client, how do I access the same data?  I was trying something I saw in a tutorial, but its not working:    db.things.find().forEach(printjson);
[06:53] jetienne_: godzirra: try something else :)
[06:53] Nuck: Things which are widely-adopted are more accepted
[06:53] Nuck: godzirra: If it's all local, just do mongo
[06:53] Nuck: And done
[06:54] chjj: Nuck: i still dont think thats justification for having a library depend on underscore or something
[06:54] jesusabdullah: hmm
[06:54] godzirra: Nuck: in node.js?  Or in the client?
[06:54] Nuck: Fuck underscore
[06:54] jesusabdullah: I'm not huge on underscore
[06:54] Nuck: async.js <3
[06:54] jesusabdullah: because it's kind of a kitchen sink
[06:54] JWarm: noob in need: I'm getting an error like this:  "-pre" if node_is_release == "0" else "" SyntaxError: invalid syntax      ….when I run ./configure in my node directory
[06:54] jesusabdullah: a really awesome kitchen sink
[06:54] jesusabdullah: but I like bathroom sinks
[06:54] chjj: Nuck: sure, whatever, im just saying, a library shouldnt depend on other general purpose libs like that
[06:54] nXqd: is mongodb the best in key-value db ? I concern speed and performance for medium project :)
[06:54] nXqd: small and medium * 
[06:55] chjj: Nuck: i would never put out a module that depended on underscore or async or anything else
[06:55] Nuck: nXqd: IT's not a key-value store
[06:55] Nuck: It's a similar niche to MySQL
[06:55] Nuck: It's a fully queryable database system
[06:56] Nuck: Except, instead of using a relational setup, it takes an approach using JSON
[06:56] jetienne_: nXqd: yes
[06:56] Nuck: If you want a key-value store, nXqd, just use Redis
[06:56] nXqd: thanks Nuck, my bad :(
[06:56] godzirra: Nuck: in the node.js code, it works just fine.  I just don't know how to access my data from the mongo command line client.
[06:56] Prometheus: redis is more appropriate called a data structure server =)
[06:56] Prometheus: not a key-value store, that does it no justice
[06:56] Prometheus: s/appropriate/appropriately
[06:56] Nuck: Prometheus: They asked for a good key-value store
[06:57] Nuck: And that's what Redis is
[06:57] jetienne_: they are all keyvalues guys come on
[06:57] Nuck: godzirra: Probably can just use mongo in shell
[06:57] nXqd: I'm thinking of using a small and fast db with key-value driven to my small proj. Relation db is overwhelm I think :)

[06:58] nXqd: honestly, at small and medium proj, I don't care it's relation or key-value. I think we just need something fast and reliable :D
[06:59] Nuck: Then query for {'key' : key}
[06:59] jetienne_: nXqd: the answer is yes :)
[06:59] jesusabdullah: You can't store a list in yo' list?
[06:59] jesusabdullah: weak
[06:59] Prometheus: nXqd: got it, try some of the projects mentioned above and see which you like best
[06:59] Nuck: jesusabdullah: I can do anything JSON can do
[06:59] Nuck: But I can also query anything
[06:59] nXqd: jetienne_: thanks xD I really want to see the cons and pros with two competitor redis vs mongodb when people discuss here 
[06:59] jesusabdullah: then JSON can do [ key, value ]
[06:59] Nuck: Mongo is, simply put, Mongo + SQL
[07:00] jesusabdullah: how many times over?
[07:00] jesusabdullah: or is sql 0?
[07:00] chjj: Nuck: " I can do anything JSON can do" -- quote of the century
[07:00] jetienne_: nXqd: you shouldnt. take a day or two for each
[07:00] Nuck: chjj: haha
[07:01] jesusabdullah: couchjs communicates with the couchdb core with newline-termintated json via stdin and stdout

[08:08] abraxas: Does anyone have any advice on how to implement cluster when it's not in the main js-file of your app? I'm having very odd problems.
[08:09] webben: skunkape: use a form, use POST http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.5 , use a button, style the button to look like a link with CSS if you must
[08:10] skunkape: AAA_awrite, correct. the browser doesn't "PUT" either. I was able to use methodOverride to override POST to a PUT by using a hidden input with the name "_method". How can I use methodOverride on a link to delete an item. without needing a form?
[08:10] abraxas: I'm probably doing it wrong, but I find the docks lacking.
[08:10] abraxas: docs
[08:10] AAA_awright: skunkape: You can't. You never, ever use GET to delete something
[08:11] AAA_awright: Or edit something, or even log a user out, don't do it
[08:11] skunkape: AAA_awright, you misunderstand

[08:11] _kud has joined the channel
[08:12] dividinglimits has joined the channel
[08:12] AAA_awright: Links don't change the state of the webserver, you shouldn't have a "delete" link, unless it redirects you to a page that has a "Are you sure you want to delete?" button+form
[08:12] skunkape: webben, do I have to use a form to get methodOverride to work?
[08:12] fangel has joined the channel
[08:13] skunkape: AAA_awright, you are talking about the olden times when such a simple task required a dedicated page.
[08:13] AAA_awright: It's a UI thing and a technical thing, a GET request MUST NOT change the state of a web server, you can't override it
[08:13] skunkape: that simple "confirm" can be easily wrapped into a javascript widget that can run on any webpage
[08:14] AAA_awright: And it's a UI thing because people have to know clicking links won't make any state changes, only buttons will
[08:14] tiagobutzke has joined the channel
[08:15] AAA_awright: If you have a form, you have "Save" as a button and "Cancel" as a link, most people get that right but it's amazing how many people want to make "Cancel" a button too
[08:16] ph^ has joined the channel
[08:17] webben: skunkape: You definitely shouldn't use a link for a delete action.
[08:17] AAA_awright: skunkape: If you have a small pop-up when you click a link that shows a button, that works
[08:17] webben: skunkape: Since clients may automatically request such links assuming they're safe.

[08:19] webben: skunkape: methodOverride as you put it is purely a matter of how the server chooses to interpret the request (incorrectly, if used on a GET). it's meaningless to clients
[08:20] skunkape: lol, thanks guys. so if I if I have a link that triggers something like if(confirm(blah){.. will that be acceptable?
[08:20] webben: skunkape: http://blog.moertel.com/articles/2005/10/25/google-web-accelerator-vs-unsafe-linking-round-two
[08:21] webben: skunkape: Well that would be less likely to break so catastrophically, but also introduces entirely unnecessary JS dependence, so is still failsome.
[08:21] webben: (and you're still using a UI for a non-destructive action for a destructive action)

[09:06] abraxas: We currently use 2 sessions. Socket.IO's, and our own… kinda redundant it seems.
[09:06] `3rdEden: abraxas they are `connection` sessions
[09:06] pen has joined the channel
[09:06] `3rdEden: not the regular connect / express sessions
[09:06] abraxas: Right, it's true… it's not exactly the same.

[10:15] jetienne: oh no, no lru and such

[10:16] jetienne: Glenjamin: in my case it is to keep track of which textures i push in the gpu for webgl

[10:17] jetienne: Glenjamin: in theory, gc should get rid of it. so "why it doesnt" is the question

[13:28] bnoordhuis: Silex: depends - what do you want to do?
[13:28] Silex: yeah, cmake's project generation is boring, as soon as you do smart stuffs all it can do is "make" inside msvc without being able to load the errors in the IDE or debug-attach to executable
[13:29] Silex: bnoordhuis: stuffs like library finders, build external dependencies..

[14:06] DrMcKay: bnoordhuis: you're trolling, right?
[14:06] kuebk: bnoordhuis ok
[14:06] kuebk: but when I only use write

[14:08] DrMcKay: no, he *has* to be trolling us.
[14:08] DrMcKay: right?
[14:08] bnoordhuis: hahaha
[14:08] tuhoojabotti: Ok.
[14:08] ilya: does anyone run their code as bytcode in node ?
[14:08] bnoordhuis: awesome innit?
[14:08] random123: It is sort of pushed that you should use "exports" instead of "global" to share variable/state between modules if you split up your app, however using exports is lacking some behavior, you can't actually modify them?
[14:08] bnoordhuis: it's a side project of piscisaureus and me
[14:08] ilya: I mean .. does node support compile/exec bytecode or some sort of caching ... ?
[14:08] tuhoojabotti: bnoordhuis: You really made me laugh.
[14:08] ilya: just to know ...
[14:08] tbranyen: yo sup ilya 
[14:09] ilya: not sure if it makes huge sense
[14:09] tuhoojabotti: ilya: Don't think so, v8 does the job for you.
[14:09] DrMcKay: bnoordhuis: my eyes hurt now. and it's because of you.
[14:09] tuhoojabotti: ilya: Better not think about that.
[14:09] DrMcKay: my head hurts.
[14:09] tbranyen: bnoordhuis: why why why why
[14:09] piscisaureus: tuhoojabotti: yes, we do it for the trolling karma
[14:09] ilya: lol
[14:09] tbranyen: i guess it ahd to be done
[14:09] bergie has joined the channel
[14:09] piscisaureus: we even figured that php trunk already contains ryah's http parser
[14:10] DrMcKay: but it's a blasphemy!
[14:10] ilya: i can see in node.gyp there is a list of all 'lib/*.js' files and it says 'v8_use_snapshot'
[14:10] bnoordhuis: i come from a land of atheists!
[14:10] bnoordhuis: ilya: v8 snapshotting is something that makes the vm start up quicker
[14:10] DrMcKay: bnoordhuis: I believe node is actually a religion
[14:11] tuhoojabotti: I come from the land downunder
[14:11] tuhoojabotti: For those who live in Australia.
[14:11] DrMcKay: lol
[14:11] ilya: ah, ok .. so that's a good thing then
[14:11] bnoordhuis: ilya: only if you like fast start-up times
[14:11] ilya: but one might as well do suspend-to-ram or hybernate
[14:11] ilya: in the os
[14:12] ilya: provided the app doesn't crash :()
[14:12] tuhoojabotti: ilya: it's better not worry about stuff, just write code and let other people do the worrying. :3
[14:12] ilya: ok ok
[14:12] bnoordhuis: ilya: in a nutshell: string, array, date, etc. are real javascript classes in v8, not just stubs for the c implementation
[14:12] pkrumins: New blog post! We open-sourced 90 node.js modules at Browserling! http://www.catonmat.net/blog/browserling-open-sources-90-node-modules/
[14:13] pkrumins: We crazy!
[14:13] bnoordhuis: ilya: what snapshotting does is compile that javascript in machine code in advance
[14:13] ilya: yeah, that's what I was thinking of

[14:13] TheEmpath: hail nodelings
[14:14] tbranyen: heil
[14:14] TheEmpath: I'm wrapping my tineh brain around mixins/traits so I can share code/data between Node and the browser
[14:14] ilya: suppose I have such an application where this would quite right, because cause there the code woudn't change
[14:14] FireFly has joined the channel
[14:14] bnoordhuis: ilya: unless your app is short-lived and starts up often, don't worry about it
[14:14] ilya: embedded node.js and the app would be included in the firmware
[14:15] ilya: bnoordhuis: yeah, that may be the case really :)
[14:15] TheEmpath: so think of a venn diagram where in the center is a basic data structure... when i use the data structure on the client, i get methods to interface with the client cache of that data as well as modifiers to send change requests server side... when i use that data structure on node, i get methods to interface mongoose as well as ways to push change requests client side
[14:15] bnoordhuis: ilya: node wouldn't be my first pick for such environments
[14:15] ilya: but then, may be it would be more comfortable to include my code in lib and build node executable with it :)
[14:16] bnoordhuis: ilya: what are you doing / what platform are you targeting?
[14:16] TheEmpath: the structure is shared in both environments and the chance for reusability is very high... mixins look like they can do the job, but there are performance limitations that bother me
[14:16] ilya: bnoordhuis: I'm thinking of sub-ghz arm SoCs
[14:16] TheEmpath: traits.js is neet, but how collisions are handled are irksome
[14:16] ilya: for home and entertainment stuff

[14:16] TheEmpath: curious what the brain pit thinks and suggests about this issue, if at all
[14:17] bnoordhuis: ilya: node's probably a poor fit, v8 is rather memory hungry
[14:17] butu5 has joined the channel
[14:17] ilya: hm .. good to know 
[14:17] bnoordhuis: ilya: even a do-nothing vm probably uses at least 10M
[14:17] TheEmpath: woah... vms in firmware... i dunno about that
[14:17] Cromulent has joined the channel
[14:18] ilya: yeah, but memory is not that expensive anymore
[14:18] TheEmpath: that would radicalize the amount of people who can make their own hardware, but it will add lots of overhead and what not
[14:18] TheEmpath: at least with C, when it busts, you know up front
[14:18] ilya: and there people using wince+dotnet on their "embedded" applications
[14:18] TheEmpath: imagine the GC causing  stop light to not function :X
[14:19] bnoordhuis: TheEmpath: you realize that blueray code runs in a vm? :)
[14:19] bnoordhuis: a rather more limited one than v8 though
[14:19] ilya: sure .. well, I would do a small C lib to it as well, just use node for some things which it's good for
[14:20] TheEmpath: i'd imagine there would be vms for firmware, but those would be much different than usual server applications
[14:20] ilya: ah, yeah .. sure
[14:20] TheEmpath: well cheers to ilya for dreaming big
[14:20] TheEmpath: +1 beer ilya
[14:21] bnoordhuis: ilya: it could work but you'll have to do a lot of tweaking
[14:21] ilya: I'll get it to run in qemu first without and mmu on uclinux ;] 
[14:21] bnoordhuis: ilya: v8 is optimized for desktops, node for servers
[14:21] ilya: ok, but things like Plug Computer
[14:21] ilya: I'm sure rails would be a bit of killer
[14:22] bnoordhuis: oh sure, there is no hardware where rails runs on properly

[15:44] varun: ?
[15:44] bnoordhuis: varun: security covers a broad range of topics
[15:44] bnoordhuis: varun: what specifically are you after?
[15:45] varun: For a web based application 
[15:45] TheJH: varun, depends on what you want to secure and what kinds of attacks you want to secure your code aganist
[15:45] TheJH: varun, are you using something liek socket.io? or just http?
[15:45] TheJH: *like
[15:46] varun: I am still through the design phase
[15:46] TheJH: varun, is your page going to be with much client-side JS and server->client live updates?
[15:46] varun: mostly as its a real time web based application

[15:48] varun: let me open
[15:48] blueadept: take a look at that, its an abstraction for realtime data streams, uses socket.io 
[15:49] TheJH: varun, socket.io is JSON message passing, dnode is RPC with callback-passing support and so on on top of it and nowjs (which I personally don't like) is a wagic box that uses dirty tricks to keep being half-sqnced
[15:49] blueadept: ha

[17:13] adrianmg has joined the channel
[17:14] olegp: you could have cpu intensive callbacks, but its quite hard to intentionally write one

[17:14] olegp: and that would hang, not block ;)
[17:15] augustl: ap123: the only ways to block is to use one of the blocking APIs which is always called somethingSync, or do an ininite loop or something in a event handler.
[17:15] ap123: correct
[17:15] olegp: now, the amount of processing you do per callback does vary
[17:16] olegp: so as a result if say you want to process http requests, the variance in response times will be great

[17:16] olegp: scroll down to the benchmarks section here: https://github.com/olegp/common-node#readme
[17:16] ap123: so, if i have a heavy callback, will it block other requests to the same callback?
[17:16] olegp: if you look at ringo (java webapp container), its often a flat line, ie all responses take the same time to return

[18:25] jtmkrueger: where is my NODE_PATH?
[18:25] jtmkrueger: I can't find it in my .bash_profile
[18:25] jamescarr: tjholowaychuk, how would you implement after callbacks?
[18:26] jamescarr: I've been a little curious on how to do that myself
[18:26] jtmkrueger: ACTION installed node a different way last time, and is trying to do everything with homebrew this time
[18:26] tjholowaychuk: jamescarr i haven't fully decided what to do as far as parallelism yet etc
[18:26] tjholowaychuk: vows and friends are really slow
[18:26] tjholowaychuk: BUT
[18:26] tjholowaychuk: much easier to manage
[18:26] guybrush: ACTION would like to install node with npm
[18:26] jamescarr: tjholowaychuk, parallelism isn't too important really
[18:27] enhydra has joined the channel
[18:27] jamescarr: it takes awhile before the benefits even become relevant
[18:27] tjholowaychuk: i think it is
[18:27] jamescarr: really?
[18:27] chrisdickinson: the problem is that with testing, the goal is accuracy, then speed.
[18:27] jamescarr: well, for really large projects it might
[18:27] tjholowaychuk: most of my < 1s tests would be roughly 15s with the other frameworks
[18:27] tjholowaychuk: not a huge PITA but still not ideal
[18:27] tjholowaychuk: i have a plan though
[18:27] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: how so?
[18:27] matyr has joined the channel
[18:27] d0k_ has joined the channel
[18:27] chrisdickinson: re: the 15s / 1s bit?
[18:27] tjholowaychuk: because serial == slow
[18:28] chrisdickinson: ah. but serial == accurate, as well.
[18:28] tjholowaychuk: doesn't really have anything to do with accuracy, but yeah it's important sometimes
[18:28] tjholowaychuk: and easier to work with
[18:28] tjholowaychuk: but we can have both
[18:28] tjholowaychuk: in a sense you could argue that parallel == accurate as race-conditions could pop up etc
[18:28] chrisdickinson: i'd like to see something that defaults to serial and can be provided with environment setup instructions for parallel testing.
[18:28] jtmkrueger: did anyone in here install node with homebrew?
[18:28] jamescarr: tjholowaychuk, AH
[18:29] jamescarr: tjholowaychuk, now I get it
[18:29] matyr__ has joined the channel
[18:29] jamescarr: I didn't even think about race conditions
[18:29] tjholowaychuk: chrisdickinson yeah i plan on allowing you to specify if the default is parallel or serial
[18:29] tjholowaychuk: and then with little function helpers you can scope the test cases
[18:29] tjholowaychuk: to the opposite
[18:29] jamescarr: I assume testing for race conditions becomes pretty important for the framework things you do
[18:29] BrianTheCoder has joined the channel
[18:30] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: hm. see, i'm writing tests for an orm (which eventually may support transaction-less environments); so serial is the right way to go in my case.
[18:30] tjholowaychuk: yeah for sure
[18:30] tjholowaychuk: for cases like that when you want to flush the db each time
[18:30] tjholowaychuk: it definitely makes sense
[18:30] stelleg: has anyone gotten websockets to work with any build of firefox?
[18:30] tjholowaychuk: for the express/connect tests etc i can easily run them all parallel without trouble
[18:30] cjm has joined the channel
[18:31] stelleg: websocket
[18:31] chrisdickinson: that's true. unless someone starts stubbing.
[18:31] tjholowaychuk: yup
[18:31] chrisdickinson: slash mocking.
[18:31] `3rdEden: stelleg socket.io 0.8.x works in FF6 and should work with FF7 as well
[18:31] ryah: TheJH: i like braces
[18:31] TheJH: ryah, well, they're still there, just hidden :D
[18:31] chrisdickinson: which, in a lot of cases, can be super useful -- stubbing out req.send / next to capture params so you don't have to run the full http server stack in your test suite
[18:32] chrisdickinson: plus being able to grab metadata about the response -- what template was used, what's in context, etc.

[18:32] stelleg: `3rdEden: yeah I should check out socket.io, but I was hoping to just use vanilla websockets

[18:33] jamescarr: stelleg, it does
[18:33] jamescarr: stelleg, socket.io works in IE5
[18:33] jamescarr: I mean
[18:33] tjholowaychuk: chrisdickinson im not a fan of mocking
[18:33] jamescarr: IE5.5
[18:33] tjholowaychuk: when you dont have to
[18:33] tjholowaychuk: i dont
[18:33] tjholowaychuk: which is almost never
[18:33] stelleg: jamescarr: wow
[18:33] DrMcKay: ryah: issues once per 10 minutes?
[18:33] `3rdEden: stelleg: it should for FF 5
[18:33] `3rdEden: ff6 and ff7 have native websockets
[18:33] `3rdEden: so the fallback will not be used there
[18:33] ryah: DrMcKay: yeah
[18:34] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: fair enough. i think it's useful in cases where you want to specifically test certain execution paths, and not others.
[18:34] ryah: DrMcKay: or maybe every 5 minues/
[18:34] stelleg: `3rdEden: yeah, although I haven't been able to get ff6,7,8,or 9 to work with any websocket examples
[18:34] random123: Off question I've been trying to get an answer to: If using module.exports is a nice way to bring in variables into the local namespace and avoid using globals, how can you modify those variables so they affect all future requires
[18:34] chrisdickinson: (testing the req / res cycle without testing the template/view layer, in the above example.)
[18:34] zeade has joined the channel
[18:34] DrMcKay: ryah: ok
[18:35] `3rdEden: stelleg: that is because they implement the latest version of the WebSocket draft. Most example online only work with old drafts
[18:35] tjholowaychuk: chrisdickinson plus if we dont run the entire thing serial, it can be strategic, so it's still reasonably fast
[18:35] random123: Because if you could modify those variables then I think they could actually replace globals and be safer, but I see no way to do this within globals...
[18:35] pifantastic has joined the channel
[18:35] tjholowaychuk: while giving you the flexibility you need for mocking etc
[18:35] random123: without globals***
[18:35] tjholowaychuk: i think vows does that with "batches" or something
[18:35] jtmkrueger: would using npm be smarter
[18:35] tjholowaychuk: still seemed slow though, node-http-proxy doesn't have many tests and it was 7x slower than express
[18:35] jtmkrueger: than /usr/local/lib/node_modules to your NODE_PATH environment variable
[18:35] jtmkrueger: ?
[18:36] stelleg: `3rdEden: I guess I assumed the websocket-server node.js library would be up to date

[18:38] `3rdEden: jamescarr yeah it's amazingly easy :p
[18:38] tjholowaychuk: i haven't worked on socket.io
[18:38] `3rdEden: tjholowaychuk thats why he highlighted me ;)
[18:38] jamescarr: tjholowaychuk, I know, I was praising `3rdEden  :)
[18:38] TheEmpath2: so mongoose.... mongoose is nice... me likey... but i wonder if there was a way to get a "client-friendly" version of the model?  say when i access the model in node, i get the mongo interface, but when i access it from a <script> tag, i get the data structure and client-side methods?
[18:38] chrisdickinson: when you replace 'exports', the global, module.exports (the thing other packages look for when grabbing your exports) doesn't change.
[18:39] tjholowaychuk: oh why did it highlight me
[18:39] tjholowaychuk: wtf
[18:39] TheEmpath2: that way i can share strcuture and resolve integration problems centrally
[18:39] tjholowaychuk: oh
[18:39] tjholowaychuk: i have it set to highlight "express"

[19:03] seebees: random123: the module object is cached on request.cache
[19:03] random123: TheJH: if that variables doesnt stay in sync then it uses a lot of its utility that globals have
[19:04] random123: TheJH: loses***
[19:04] seebees: random123: If you change a property of the object it will change that property in the cache
[19:04] jamescarr: hmmm... I'm on the verge of making a rails like collection of scripts that combine express, mongodb, socket.io, and twitter's bootstrap UI
[19:05] random123: seebees: If subsequent files cannot see the changes to that object then I see no other choice than to use globals, am I not correct?

[19:06] random123: seebees: Basically, I have a variable, a specific variable that I need to share between files, but I need to be able to change it, thus, exports cannot work for me?
[19:06] seebees: random123, why not just make a getter and setter?
[19:07] random123: seebees: I like the fact that exports allow you to choose where you leak variables, based on what files require, but I don't like the fact that you cannot truly modify them

[22:11] Nuck: :D
[22:11] DrMcKay: aaronmcadam: you could install it anywhere you want, but it's more convenient, I believe
[22:12] Nuck: A simple, fast parser.
[22:12] aaronmcadam: as opposed to having to run a script that requires the module all the time
[22:12] aaronmcadam: sets it as a sort of alias you can use anywhere?

[22:13] aaronmcadam: that's why windows support for npm is so rocky right now right
[22:13] DrMcKay: it won't be easy to fix

[22:14] aaronmcadam: haha well that's a given :D
[22:14] DrMcKay: aaronmcadam: mklink 
[22:15] aaronmcadam: does it actually work like you'd expect tho?
[22:15] aaronmcadam: knowing windows it's gotta have some quirk
[22:15] DrMcKay: aaronmcadam: hah, nothing works as you would expect it on Windows
[22:15] aaronmcadam: i wonder if it's really an alias with a hack of xcopy or somethin
