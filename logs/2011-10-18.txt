[00:24] bikcmp: hi all... i installed nodejs and nodejs-dev via apt on ubuntu
[00:24] bikcmp: what's the binary called?
[00:24] bikcmp: it's not "node".
[00:25] Dmitrijus: dpkg -L nodejs-dev?
[00:25] bikcmp: hm
[00:25] bikcmp: /usr/bin/node-waf
[00:25] bikcmp: jason@jason-HP-Mini-110-1000:~/webchat/webchat$ node-waf webchat.js 
[00:25] bikcmp: Waf: Please run waf from a directory containing a file named "wscript" or run distclean
[00:25] zivester_ has joined the channel
[00:26] TheJH: bikcmp, waf is a build tool bundled with node
[00:26] reid has joined the channel
[00:26] bikcmp: hm.
[00:26] Dmitrijus: bikcmp: have you installed nodejs package? this package is complementary (provides build utilities and headers)
[00:26] bikcmp: yah
[00:27] mmalecki: try nodejs
[00:27] TheJH: bikcmp, it's /usr/bin/node , i think
[00:27] bikcmp: hm
[00:27] bikcmp: TheJH: not there when i asked, but when i reinstalled it's there
[00:27] TheJH: mmalecki, the ubuntu package contains /usr/bin/node
[00:27] bikcmp: thing is now my code doesn't work :P
[00:27] konobi: `hash -r`
[00:28] mmalecki: TheJH: so only fedora will rename it?
[00:28] mmalecki: awesome
[00:28] rmzg has joined the channel
[00:28] konobi: bikcmp: bash will cache binary names based on lookup paths... run `hash -r` to update what it thinks of the world
[00:29] bikcmp: konobi: i've found it, actually
[00:29] bikcmp: how would I install something?
[00:29] bikcmp: in the sense of like
[00:29] bikcmp: hm
[00:29] smathy: Fedora is so awesome - but literally, and not a good kinda awe.
[00:29] bikcmp: ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
[00:29] konobi: node vs /usr/bin/node ?
[00:29] bikcmp: konobi: reinstalled it
[00:29] rchavik has joined the channel
[00:29] bikcmp: is there something like easy_install for node?
[00:29] konobi: npm
[00:30] bikcmp: does it have a ubuntu/debian package?
[00:30] bikcmp: The program 'npm' is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing:
[00:30] bikcmp: sudo apt-get install mricron
[00:30] bikcmp: doubt that's it
[00:30] isaacs: bikcmp: noooo!!! don't do it
[00:30] isaacs: ircretary: inst bikcmp 
[00:30] ircretary: bikcmp: `curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh` (or, if there are permission issues, you can try: `curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh`)
[00:30] WarheadsSE: see npmjs.org
[00:30] bikcmp: isaacs:i didn't ;p
[00:30] isaacs: bikcmp: that gives you NPM, not npm
[00:30] TheJH: !@bikcmp mem NPM
[00:30] jhbot: bikcmp, NPM is not npm. and its name conflicts with npm. uninstall it. NPM is http://www.cabiatl.com/mricro/npm/

[00:33] SubStack: hold off a bit on sharing though for the start
[00:33] bikcmp: node.js actually looks kinda cool. ;p

[00:37] SubStack: isaacs: well you can also run them in parallel
[00:37] isaacs: oiv
[00:37] isaacs: *oic
[00:37] isaacs: then you really ought to have a 100000 minute plan.
[00:37] isaacs: ie, "At least one test is running at all times"
[00:37] SubStack: but if you're running more tests than that we can set you up with a dedicated cluster
[00:37] isaacs: usually more
[00:37] isaacs: sure, that makes sense.
[00:37] te-brian: Latest node up was interesting... you guys definitely nerded out more than usual :)
[00:37] mmalecki: SubStack++
[00:37] v8bot_:  mmalecki has given a beer to SubStack. SubStack now has 10 beers.
[00:39] isaacs: te-brian: i think substack and i are the more nerdy of the group, actually.  mikeal and felixge seem more human, less robot.

[01:33] rootslab: hi ;)
[01:33] isaacs: hello :)
[01:33] rootslab: I have replied to your post
[01:34] rootslab: thanks for your explanation, however ;)
[01:34] Yuezi has joined the channel
[01:34] CarterL has joined the channel
[01:35] isaacs: np
[01:35] isaacs: i see this.
[01:35] isaacs: you can't rely on the client calling pause and resume.
[01:35] isaacs: because you'er going to just pipe it to another filter.
[01:35] cafesofie has joined the channel
[01:36] rootslab: mm, yes
[01:36] isaacs: request.get("http://some-server.com/").pipe(new dropper(16)).pipe(zlib.Gzip()).pipe(whatever)
[01:36] isaacs: they might not even keep a reference to it
[01:36] rootslab: yes it's possible but not pretty
[01:36] isaacs: once you hand a buffer off, whether it's to a binding or an fs function or a .write() operation or a "data" event emission, it's *not your buffer* any more, and you're not allowed to touch it.
[01:37] isaacs: zero exceptions, unfortunately.
[01:37] rootslab: ha ha
[01:37] rootslab: ok
[01:37] sdwrage has joined the channel
[01:37] isaacs: i know, it's frustrating sometimes :)
[01:37] WarheadsSE: hmm, going to have to keep that in mind :p
[01:37] ritch has left the channel
[01:38] isaacs: rootslab: so, for the benchmark i was running, i think that dropper is just slightly faster because of the cases where i'm creating a new buffer rather than reusing the old one.
[01:39] isaacs: the difference is very slight.
[01:39] k1ttty has joined the channel
[01:39] rootslab: yes, but I thought that the difference is measurable
[01:39] rootslab: was
[01:40] rootslab: :D ah ah
[01:40] amigojapan has joined the channel
[01:40] isaacs: also, block-stream is somewhat optimized for the padded use-case.
[01:40] fbartho has joined the channel
[01:40] isaacs: when you set {nopad: true } it does some extra array juggling.
[01:41] isaacs: but i don't know if it's enough to account for the difference in time
[01:41] rootslab: But your approach is to slice or/and create new Buffer on every data emission ?
[01:42] rootslab: I try to see deeply at the code now
[01:43] isaacs: yeah, if the written buffer is exactly the right size, then i emit it, otherwise if it's too big, i slice it, or if it's too small (or if there's already an existing output copy created) then i copy it.
[01:43] d4rk1ink__: WarheadsSE: what are you trying to do with growl/notifier?
[01:43] isaacs: it'd be nice if there was some non-copy way to flatten multiple arrays into one, but i don't think there is, since buffers are always contiguous memory slices.
[01:44] WarheadsSE: d4rk1ink__: nothing, I've got about 90% of the GNTP spec running native in Node
[01:44] isaacs: rootslab: what you *could* do is detect cases where the collected up inputs are next to one another in the parent buffer, and treat them as one, but that's a bit magical.
[01:44] djbell has joined the channel
[01:44] WarheadsSE: Personal use really
[01:44] isaacs: and probably not worth it
[01:44] d4rk1ink__: WarheadsSE: ah I see
[01:44] boltR has joined the channel
[01:44] rootslab: ok, the same approach I have used, only I don't create a new Buffer every time
[01:44] WarheadsSE: just poking to see if there is any interest from anyone
[01:45] isaacs: once you emit it, it's not yours, though.  no trespassing!
[01:45] rootslab: I understand!!
[01:46] rootslab: I thought at algorithm
[01:47] rootslab: the cases are the same, only ,as you are telling me, I have to use new buffer every time! i
[01:47] rootslab: ok? :D
[01:47] isaacs: rootslab: also, if you add that pause/resume bit, the speed savings goes away, and then some.
[01:47] isaacs: rootslab: like, double ;)
[01:47] isaacs: $ time node bench/dropper-pause.js >/dev/null
[01:47] isaacs: real	0m30.426s
[01:47] isaacs: user	0m0.179s
[01:47] isaacs: sys	0m0.034s
[01:47] rootslab: fro version 1 to 2
[01:47] rootslab: I have seen that
[01:48] rootslab: 50 %
[01:48] rootslab: it's true
[01:48] jimt has joined the channel
[01:49] isaacs: rootslab: i mean, it goes from 7.5s to 30s if you add the pause/resume step to keep the data from being corrupted
[01:49] isaacs: and i still get invalid data ;P
[01:49] rootslab: with my tests?
[01:50] rootslab: sorry, it's late here, :O
[01:50] rootslab: :)
[01:51] isaacs: no, with the nopad-thorough.js test.
[01:51] isaacs: i just replaced "block-stream.js" with "dropper"
[01:51] WarheadsSE: d4rk1ink__: if anyone ends up interested i might bother putting it on npm... but ohwell
[01:51] isaacs: so, the reason it's taking 30s is that it never finishes, so tap times it out, apparently.
[01:51] isaacs: but i'm still seeing this:
[01:51] isaacs:       FOUND:  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

[06:01] jeremya_ has joined the channel
[06:02] madsleejensen has joined the channel
[06:02] kurmangazy: the js can talk to the domain that it came from, so I think it's because twitter and facebook is serving that js
[06:02] jeremya_: i'm having a weird issue with require. if I do 'npm install share' and then require('share'), it works. But if I then rm -rf node_modules/share; git clone http://github.com/josephg/ShareJS node_modules/share, require('share') breaks
[06:03] Thomas`-: ahh i get you
[06:03] jeremya_: ... hm, maybe because i need to 'npm install' in node_modules/share
[06:03] jeremya_: nope
[06:03] jeremya_: i still get "Cannot find module 'share'"
[06:04] jacobolus has joined the channel
[06:05] kurmangazy: I don't know what 'npm install' does, but there's an environment variable called NODE_PATH that tells node where to look

[06:06] jeremya_: hm
[06:08] kurmangazy: unfortunately, I haven't taken the time to study how npm works, but I know that if you put the directory in NODE_PATH, it will get found

[06:31] kurmangazy: I like drupal. that said, I only really know much about drupal and ASP.NET

[06:33] fzzzy has joined the channel
[06:33] Ginlock has joined the channel
[06:33] te-brian: kurmangazy: I guess the reason I ask why is.. Drupal is Drupal.. if you like it .. use it.  Its not going to be 'faster' on node.js vs. PHP .. if the application is the exact same.
[06:34] Ang3 has joined the channel
[06:34] kurmangazy: meaning that you'd have to rewrite the application to get the speed?
[06:34] te-brian: kurmangazy, At least not by much anyhow.  Now.. taking Drupal CMS concepts and making a more natvie-feeling node.js version ... well... that would be something that would get a whole lotta' attention :)
[06:34] micxer82 has joined the channel
[06:34] LuckySMack_ has joined the channel
[06:35] kurmangazy: I think that's what I had in mind. like taking what's good about Drupal and trying to recreat in it node
[06:35] te-brian: kurmangazy, Yeah... if you are having problems with Drupal speed ... it means you must have all authenticate users .. and that is an application problem with Drupal .. not a language one
[06:35] onr: kurmangazy: bytecode caching works
[06:35] AAA_awright: kurmangazy: Drupal is one of the best CMSes there is for PHP but you don't want to recreate it, it still has a lot of awful concepts that will hold it back
[06:35] te-brian: kurmangazy, Because Drupal is blazing fast for anonymous users (with Varnish :)
[06:36] kurmangazy: all of the interesting (IMO) uses of Drupal require being authenticated
[06:36] JakeyChan has joined the channel
[06:36] Efazati has joined the channel
[06:36] te-brian: kurmangazy, ^^^ what AAA_awright said.  The hole hook_ system is not right for node.js... a node.js CMS would revolve more around EventEmitter I would think
[06:37] kurmangazy: the reason it's fast for anonymous users is because it doesn't have to *do* anything, just serve the page from cache
[06:37] callumacrae has joined the channel
[06:37] AAA_awright: Not really... I have an entire music library organized by artist(s), album, and song, the songs of which you can request to be played on an Internet stream station
[06:37] AAA_awright: And comment on each of them, favorite songs, tag them by genre/melody/etc
[06:37] te-brian: kurmangazy, Yep.  And I dunno for me who cares about 'interesting' when it comes to a CMS site.  Its all about the $$$ and how best to meet your client's needs.
[06:38] saesh has joined the channel
[06:38] jeremya__ has joined the channel
[06:38] kurmangazy: AAA_awright: isn't that all basically static?
[06:38] AAA_awright: The big concept that you do _not_ want to replicate in Drupal is the concept of seperate nodes/users/comments/tags each getting their own blocks of IDs
[06:39] AAA_awright: kurmangazy: When you save the page, yeah
[06:39] te-brian: kurmangazy, You may want to check out http://calip.so/
[06:39] kurmangazy: everybody sees the same comments, so they get rendered once
[06:39] AAA_awright: Well, you get to see who's requested what song how many times
[06:39] te-brian: kurmangazy, It is a node.js 'Drupal' basically.   I haven't used it yet tho
[06:39] AAA_awright: here, http://radiohyrule.com/ all Drupal
[06:40] AAA_awright: Oh, and files
[06:40] AAA_awright: Where Drupal has really screwed us over is the fact it manages its own files... Well we're using those files externally, as song audio files and as album art images
[06:41] AAA_awright: So we have filename fields and custom templates which substitute the filename into an <img> tag. It sucks.
[06:41] jaequery has joined the channel
[06:41] AAA_awright: kurmangazy: http://magnode.org/ is my project
[06:41] te-brian: AAA_awright, I don't mind a CMS managing files.. but I completely agree that how Drupal does it is sub-optmimal
[06:41] kurmangazy: hm.. I'll have to take a look at calipso.. I'm curious to see a node CMS
[06:42] AAA_awright: te-brian: If I could say "This is where the file is located", this being an arbritary point anywhere on the filesystem, that would be great, all Drupal does is cache the metadata
[06:42] kurmangazy: AAA_awright: I can't grasp what you're saying
[06:43] te-brian: AAA_awright, Yeah.. whenever I get around to more CMSy type node apps... I will likely use MongoDB GridFS ... store meta-data with the file itself :)
[06:43] AAA_awright: kurmangazy: Which part, the files or the Magnode?
[06:43] kurmangazy: magnode.org says: 502 Bad Gateway
[06:43] AAA_awright: oh. OH. I restarted the server yesterday >_>
[06:44] kurmangazy: AAA_awright: the problem you are having with drupal managing your files
[06:44] AAA_awright: kurmangazy: http://magnode.org/doc/en/
[06:44] Thomas`-: does Nodejs require vps / dedicated hosting to install?
[06:44] AAA_awright: kurmangazy: Also, try again
[06:45] te-brian: AAA_awright, magnode looks really cool ... at a glance....
[06:45] te-brian: AAA_awright, I like the 'why invent a whole new data-relationship spec' attitude :)
[06:45] kurmangazy: AAA_awright: this concept is a little hard to take in
[06:47] manningham has joined the channel
[06:47] kurmangazy: what is RDF, exactly?
[06:47] AAA_awright: kurmangazy: The idea is that Magnode is a framework that transforms data from one type to another, and you supply a number of "transforms" that can, well, transform the data to a format a step closer to the requested output type. So I can have data right from a database "content_blog" table, and have a transform that into "Blog post HTML Body", and another which transforms it into a "Themed HTML webpage"
[06:48] kurmangazy: it seems like a fast site. is that running in node?
[06:48] AAA_awright: Yeah
[06:48] AAA_awright: Well, it's got Nginx sitting in front of it too
[06:48] kurmangazy: is that an OOP thing?
[06:49] AAA_awright: kurmangazy: Like I describe in that documentation, RDF is a data model (not unlike DOM) that makes statements about resources, where a resource is anything identifible by a URI
[06:49] AAA_awright: So I can say, <http://magnode.org/> type blogpost
[06:49] AAA_awright: <http://magnode.org/> author AAA_awright
[06:49] AAA_awright: etc
[06:50] AAA_awright: And when I dereference that URI (request it from the web server), it transforms that resource into an HTML webpage.
[06:50] anoop has joined the channel
[06:50] AAA_awright: And the cool thing is you can embed RDF data in HTML, so the webpage I return can reproduce the very data used to construct the webpage.
[06:50] AAA_awright: VERY COOL
[06:50] kurmangazy: huh
[06:51] AAA_awright: For a blog post it might not be so cool, but imagine if you're publishing a data table
[06:52] AAA_awright: Or if there's an address embedded in the webpage, if the user agent understands what an http://www.w3.org/2006/vcard/ns#Vcard is, it can load that into an address book, for instance
[06:52] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[06:53] reid has joined the channel
[06:53] AAA_awright: You don't *have* to use RDF, you could use the transform process I describe for MongoDB, or maybe even a Drupal MySQL database, who knows. But RDF is _way_ more powerful
[06:54] Corren: rdf is what neo4j uses right
[06:54] kurmangazy: this is too much to take in right now
[06:54] AAA_awright: neo4j can store RDF but it doesn't have to, iirc
[06:54] AAA_awright: It's new, certainly
[06:54] AAA_awright: I'm really trying hard to write it in a way that's easy to understand
[06:55] ph^_ has joined the channel
[06:55] AAA_awright: That's going to mean the difference between adoption and "This is too new for me"

[06:55] ivanfi has joined the channel
[06:55] AAA_awright: It's the same sort of plan that Drupal has, going after non-programmers, that's the issue

[06:58] kurmangazy: yeah Thomas`- it comes together
[06:58] AAA_awright: kurmangazy: Also the radio site I linked you to, we can't cache the main page, because it always contains the currently playing song, so I guess that counts as dynamic
[06:58] Thomas`-: ahh thanks

[10:34] nicholasThompson: hi all. Question :) I have got Node (0.4.x) running on a server. This web server is special. It cant get to the internet ITSELF. I have SSH access to it though. This makes it hard to install NPM.
[10:35] nicholasThompson: I cant run the install.sh as it tries to grab the code from Git which wont work as it cant see the web.
[10:35] nicholasThompson: I downloadede the zip tarball and tried to "make", but I get errors as it tried to install "ronnjs" using node cli.js....
[10:36] nicholasThompson: is it enough for me to just download and install this manually? Is there a better way?
[10:37] nicholasThompson: could I just clone ronnjs into node_modules of the npm tarball?
[10:38] nicholasThompson: essentially I need a fully offline installer...
[10:39] russfrank: nicholasThompson: can the server ssh to a machine with internets?
[10:39] nicholasThompson: nope
[10:39] nicholasThompson: it accepts connections on 22 and 80... it can have no outgoing connections.
[10:40] nicholasThompson: I also have no controll to alter this rather annoying "security" feature....

[10:41] russfrank: you could use an ssh tunnel, a proxy server, and tsocks
[10:41] nicholasThompson: altternatively, is there an rpm for npm?
[10:41] nicholasThompson:  ;)
[10:41] SargoDarya_: nicholasThompson: You want to use iptables
[10:42] JakeyChan_ has joined the channel
[10:42] russfrank: nicholasThompson: cant you just grab a tarball from git and scp that over
[10:42] russfrank: s/git/github
[10:42] adnasa has joined the channel
[10:42] saschagehlich: is anyone familiar with date.js?
[10:42] SargoDarya_: russfrank: That wouldn't help him much
[10:42] nicholasThompson: thats what I've done
[10:42] SargoDarya_: The machine doesn't have access
[10:42] nicholasThompson: I downloaded the tarball and SCP'd it over
[10:42] nicholasThompson: that bit works
[10:42] another_syrio: Hello all, I wanted to ask if it's possible that I'm losing data coming into stdin by a program that runs my node script by not resuming stdin/binding a data event on it? 
[10:43] russfrank: oh npm is useless to you, nvm
[10:43] SargoDarya_: so npm install will probably fail with a server not found error
[10:43] russfrank: why are you asking this question
[10:43] nicholasThompson: when I "make" the make script tries to fetch ronnjs
[10:43] russfrank: haha
[10:43] russfrank: don't get npm just make a node_modules folder manually then scp over tarballs of whatever packages you need
[10:43] nicholasThompson: hmm
[10:43] nicholasThompson: actually maybe I dont need npm, yeah
[10:43] nicholasThompson: npm is only useful on the server you DEVELOP on for installing packages
[10:44] nicholasThompson: I could just bundle dependencies with my package and transfer that over?
[10:44] SargoDarya_: nicholasThompson: Smart idea would be to create a link on your local machine to the server, install npm on your local machine and get that symlink to the node_modules folder
[10:46] SargoDarya_: martin_sunset: Yea right. I remember having an app called Colloquy. I guess Colloquies is a spinoff?
[10:47] neilk_ has joined the channel
[10:48] martin_sunset: Yeah, looks like. It is definitely worth it, I used to run chat through air display on my iPad as third screen, but having a native app is so much better

[11:04] EriksLV: ok, will check that too, thanks
[11:04] martin_sunset: EriksLV: +1 for mongoose, use it as well
[11:05] secoif: EriksLV mongoose gives you a model layer similar to ActiveRecord. I resisted using it for a long time, don't know why. It's really nice.

[11:07] secoif: actually made by the same guy that did jugglingdb
[11:07] secoif: does
[11:07] SargoDarya_: I have some sort of problems with my models...
[11:07] secoif: like?
[11:07] SargoDarya_: It always generates the schema for my model inside of the db/schema.db instead of the app/models/modelname.js
[11:08] martin_sunset: secoif: Looks interesting. 
[11:08] SargoDarya_: When trying to paste the model from the db/schema.db into the appropriate model I get model not found >.>

[14:59] Iszak: you should be able to just recompile it, but uninstalling shouldn't hurt, it's probably more safe that way.
[14:59] albertosh: ok, and the best way to uninstall it?
[15:00] Iszak: make unisntall
[15:00] albertosh: hmmm but i deleted the source
[15:00] albertosh: for 0.4.9
[15:00] Iszak: just rebuild it, it should be fine.
[15:00] albertosh: k
[15:00] albertosh: thanks

Because I don't have root access, I had to build everything from source and install locally (bin, lib, and include folders are in /home/ryland/programs.) Everything was working completely fine, so I left for about an hour. When I came back, I tried running npm install jade and it spit out: node: error while loading shared libraries: libm.so.2: cannot open share
[17:52] RylandAlmanza: d object file: No such file or directory. Now, everytime I try to do anything that involves running node, I get that same error. The provider of my shell says that he hasn't changed anything at all, so it must be a mistake on my part, but I can't figure it out. Does anyone know how to fix this?

[19:22] tjholowaychuk has joined the channel

[19:23] brianc: qbit: you still having an issue? v0.6.x of node-postgres is the first minor version to support node v0.5.x and above

[19:24] brianc: qbit: what's the issue?
[19:24] wink_: bradleymeck: oh, that'd be a bit of a bitch ;>
[19:24] kurmangazy: bradleymeck: if you have kernel-level threads, then it shouldn't block all the threads, right?
[19:24] qbit: seems that http://sprunge.us/XiFb the insert in the for loop is not working when i have a geometry in it 
[19:24] qbit: works fine when i exclude the geometry data
[19:25] bradleymeck: kurmangazy, ideally no, but threads might be sharing memory within a mutex so idk

[19:26] qbit: brianc: none
[19:26] wink_: although the fact that: Memory mapped by mmap() is preserved across fork(2), with the same attributes.

[19:32] brianc: qbit: the only thing I can think of is the st_geometryfromtext function is somehow making things act funny
[19:32] kurmangazy: I've thought about rewriting apt/synaptic to be more efficient. I think you could easily see a 10-100x speedup, so you could browse for packages without bogging down. node.js could throw in more benefits, but I think the I/O should be mmap'd, so that may defeat some of those benefits of node.js
[19:32] qbit: k
[19:32] brianc: qbit: after the first callback is called, the client._queryQueue contains the remaining queries, but not the dispatched on?
[19:32] wink_: kurmangazy: http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/forum.en.html#nabble-td5391727  looks like bradley might be correct if that guy is right

[19:44] isaacs: kurmangazy: i see

[19:44] bradleymeck: kurmangazy, i assume that program thread means the thread manager's idea of what a program is
[19:45] eddyb: really, do I have an option when it comes to node.js-based CMS?
[19:45] eddyb: it doesn't look like it
[19:45] kurmangazy: isaacs: It became extremely slow and used 100% of the cpu. I think the print()s were failing millions of times a second because the kernel buffer was full
[19:45] isaacs: i see
[19:45] harthur has joined the channel
[19:46] isaacs: kurmangazy: sax-js blows through the input pretty fast.
[19:46] isaacs: it's not doing a lot
[19:46] isaacs: kurmangazy: if you took out the sys.prints (or piped to a file or something) then it might be better.
[19:46] maushu has joined the channel
[19:47] kurmangazy: isaacs: I changed it to spool the output in one big string and do a fs.write() at the end, and it performs brilliantly. but even better would be to inter-leave input and output
[19:47] isaacs: kurmangazy: then just don't write so much at once :)

[19:50] kurmangazy: isaacs: I'm sure that example wasn't really intended to scale. but it wasn't obvious to me.
[19:51] kurmangazy: isaacs: it definitely depends on the size of the XML file. that tiny one that's included doesn't trigger the problem in any significant way
[19:51] isaacs: ugh, this example is old
[19:52] baudehlo: I think you get similar problems if you just do console.log() in a loop.

[23:54] SubStack: isaacs: correct
[23:54] catshirt has joined the channel
[23:55] isaacs: SubStack: you should also add X-Real-IP
[23:55] jesusabdullah: Yeah DTrejo, bouncy works at the net module-level while http-proxy makes use of the http module
[23:55] SubStack: for whycome?
[23:55] isaacs: SubStack: which is basically x-forwarded-for, except if there's already an x-real-ip, you can trust it.
[23:55] SubStack: bouncy uses http too but only for parsing
[23:55] isaacs: SubStack: so that you can stack proxies, and found out who the real ip was.
[23:55] SubStack: aha
[23:55] isaacs: SubStack: since x-forwarded-for will be overwritten at each hop
[23:55] SubStack: excellent idea
[23:55] jesusabdullah: SubStack: Right!
[23:56] jesusabdullah: httpparser directly, right?
[23:56] isaacs: SubStack: otoh, you need to have a way to tell bouncy *not* to trust the request.headers['x-real-ip']
[23:56] jesusabdullah: hhttppbvd
[23:56] isaacs: SubStack: since you should only trust that once it comes into your app layer
[23:56] isaacs: or onto the network you control
[23:57] slifty has joined the channel
[23:57] SubStack: maybe that logic is best left to user code
[23:57] SubStack: trust networks
[23:57] SubStack: or just a list of known proxy forwarders
[23:57] isaacs: SubStack: i think the default should be to set x-real-ip if it's not already set.
[23:57] SubStack: k
[23:57] isaacs: SubStack: and then have your edge proxies do headers['x-real-ip'] = headers[x-forwarded-for]
[23:57] isaacs: SubStack: since it's easy to override.
[23:57] SubStack: right
[23:58] isaacs: SubStack: since people will send you requests with x-real-ip of something else, to be spooky and spoof the connection
[23:58] SubStack: makes sense
[23:59] isaacs: http proxying is really amazing.  you start out with the intention of doing nothing that isn't absolutely necessary, and *still* end up with a giant pile of features.
[23:59] isaacs: if you're not careful, bouncy will be sending email before too long
[23:59] DTrejo: hehe
