[00:39] isaacs: thatmarvin: sure
[00:39] isaacs: what's up?
[00:39] thatmarvin: so if my package.json has {dependencies: { existing-npm-module: my-custom-fork.tar.gz }}, how should i make it such that npm would overwrite the existing version when i do "npm install"? bump version? rename it?
[00:40] isaacs: thatmarvin: npm rm existing-npm-module; npm install
[00:40] marcello3d has joined the channel
[00:40] thatmarvin: oh so i have to explicitly remove it.
[00:40] thatmarvin: ok thanks
[00:40] isaacs: thatmarvin: or, you could do:  npm install http://blah/blah/my-custom-fork.tar.gz
[00:40] isaacs: thatmarvin: install <pkg> will clobber
[00:40] isaacs: install (noargs) will just fill in the blanks

[01:54] isaacs: secoif: yes.
[01:54] isaacs: secoif: or, load it into the env or something before you start your app
[01:54] davidbanham: isaacs: I think I might have lied. Just tried to reinstall from source and there's no libssl-dev installed. Rebuilding 0.4.9 and will reinstall. Thanks for the pointer.
[01:54] isaacs: davidbanham: np
[01:55] isaacs: davidbanham: btw, 0.4.12 might have some bug fixes that could be relevant to you, but you probably want to change as little as possible right now.
[01:55] secoif: isaacs loading the env before starting app is a good idea, need to figure out how to get that to work with the test suite
[01:55] davidbanham: isaacs: That's my plan! Just make it work is the goal today. I'll jump straight to the 6 branch once I sort out my application's test suite.
[01:56] isaacs: sweet!

[01:57] secoif: isaacs I couldâ€¦ do a while loop in the config file that blocksâ€¦ until the async completesâ€¦
[01:57] isaacs: secoif: !!!

[01:57] isaacs: secoif: it won't actually complete.
[01:57] idefine has joined the channel
[01:57] secoif: oh of course
[01:57] isaacs: secoif: since it'll never dip back into the thread pool
[01:57] secoif: cause 
[01:57] secoif: yeah
[01:57] isaacs: no interrupts in node :)
[01:58] isaacs: secoif: you know, you can actually put configs in npm, and then packages can see them if you start your stuff with `npm start <pkgname>`
[01:58] chilts: oooh ... cool
[01:58] isaacs: http://npmjs.org/doc/config.html#Per-Package-Config-Settings
[01:58] chilts: can that also determine if it's a dev, testing, staging, live environment?
[01:58] isaacs: sure
[01:58] chilts: excellent, that's what I've been looking for :)
[01:59] chilts: isaacs: ++
[01:59] chilts: hmm, no beer count
[01:59] isaacs: so if you do `npm config set name:key val` then when you do `npm start name` it'll see process.env.npm_package_config_key="val"
[01:59] innociv has joined the channel
[02:00] chilts: sweet
[02:00] secoif: isaacs my current configuration management is a little convoluted, that sounds pretty simple
[02:00] isaacs: secoif: it's not very well documented, but it is pretty simple
[02:00] secoif: though again, test suite is a problem.
[02:00] isaacs: secoif: i think the nodejitsu guys have a much fancier thing that can hook into different backends
[02:00] secoif: isaacs yeah I'm using nconf right now, but I feel like I'm using a tractor to eat my breakfast 
[02:01] isaacs: hahah
[02:05] TN has joined the channel
[02:06] secoif: isaacs so, I've got to run `nodeunit ./test/something` and the something requires '../config' is there a way I can set up the values of that config module before nodeunit runs

[02:08] isaacs: secoif: you can require("../config.js"), i mean, that's sync, right?
[02:09] isaacs: secoif: i usually have a config.js or something that just does exports.foo = process.env.npm_package_config_foo ...

[02:09] secoif: yeah, but, like, I'm thinking prepriming the module cache or something
[02:09] isaacs: what's wrong with using require()?
[02:09] noodlehaus has joined the channel
[02:09] isaacs: does the config have to fetch something or do some network io?
[02:10] noodlehaus: hi folks
[02:10] noodlehaus: any recommended mysql ORM for nodejs?
[02:10] secoif: noodlehaus http://toolbox.no.de/search?q=orm
[02:10] noodlehaus: currently looking at either persistence.js and sequelize, would appreciate any feedback on them
[02:10] noodlehaus: yeah sec, done that, in the process of getting feedback on some options
[02:11] secoif: noodlehaus cool
[02:11] secoif: isaacs yeah it's got to do a bunch of file checks and whatnot, the app startup time is a bit crappy
[02:11] isaacs: secoif: well, i mean, it's just startup, though, right?
[02:11] isaacs: secoif: fwiw, this is why i have npm.load(â€¦) and then that calls an ini.resolveConfigs() that does all the config file readin
[02:12] isaacs: secoif: some packages we have at joyent just put all the configs in a json file, and do var conf = require("./config.json")
[02:12] strmpnk has joined the channel
[02:12] isaacs: secoif: that's easy, because then you can have a production one and a dev one, and just swap a symlink
[02:12] secoif: til require can load a json file.

[02:21] context: you aren't catching an exception
[02:21] joshsmith: is it because of the connection.session() MemoryStore?
[02:22] context: whats line line 10
[02:22] context: and shouldn't be. thats a warning
[02:22] joshsmith: people are getting a 500 error
[02:22] joshsmith: I think because of that
[02:22] context: cause your app is throwing an exception
[02:22] context: why are you using memory sessions in production
[02:23] joshsmith: idk that I am explicitly doing so
[02:24] context: im assuming its the default then

[02:28] AD7six has joined the channel
[02:28] context: i doubt nodejitsu is letting you login to postgres as postgres
[02:29] joshsmith: context: it's on a remote server with Rackspace
[02:29] joshsmith: secoif: could this be caused by not closing the connection properly?
[02:29] context: i doubt rackspace is letting you login as postgres
[02:29] context: nor should you be using the postgres user for apps
[02:30] joshsmith: well, I am able to login as postgres
[02:30] secoif: joshsmith listen for 'error' and the param passed to the handler might give you more info
[02:30] pauls1 has joined the channel
[02:30] secoif: attach it to the clientâ€¦ something like client.on('error', function() {console.log(arguments)})
[02:30] context: and over the internet.... scary
[02:30] context: you know by default postgres doesn't allow logging in as postgres over tcp
[02:31] context: just cause it works locally doesn't mean it will work remotely
[02:31] joshsmith: it is working, but I didn't realize it shouldn't be
[02:31] joshsmith: ideally how should I set it up?
[02:31] luoluoluo: hi there, can I do nodejs do like require("http://api.map.baidu.com/api?v=1.2") to include remote api js?
[02:31] context: joshsmith: you should have a user made specific for your app
[02:32] secoif: luoluoluo you might want to look into browserify, stitch, or requirejs if you want to do thatâ€¦ or even dnode
[02:32] context: luoluoluo: considering that url is doing document.write() with html i doubt its gonna do much for you in node
[02:33] luoluoluo: context: that means I can only do it in browser instead of server side?
[02:33] secoif: luoluoluo actually, are you trying to require remote file into node, or node into yout html
[02:33] ChaoWang has joined the channel
[02:33] context: and the script it includes has everything inclosed in an anonymous scope its rather useless
[02:33] luoluoluo: secoif: require remote file into node
[02:33] context: luoluoluo: yes.
[02:33] secoif: luoluoluo why are you doing 'document.write' on the server??
[02:34] secoif: i am confused.
[02:34] luoluoluo: context: I see...... thanks. :)
[02:34] luoluoluo: secoif: that's an 3rd party api provided by baidu.com not mine
[02:35] luoluoluo: secoif: in its document it just show how to do it in browser.  But I want to do it on server side. So I think about node

[02:37] context: he is trying to access their browser specific script from node. but its not designed for that
[02:37] secoif: you could try using it inside a headless browser
[02:37] luoluoluo: context: thanks, I may just do it in browser. :D
[02:37] joshsmith: secoif: what param should I be passing to the handler?
[02:37] luoluoluo: secoif: thanks
[02:38] joshsmith: client.on('error', function( what? ) { console.log( what? ); });
[02:38] secoif: joshsmith you can call it whatever you want
[02:38] joshsmith: do I write that before client.connect()?
[02:38] vlucas has joined the channel
[02:39] secoif: joshsmith if you console.log(arguments) you'll see what data is passed to the function

[02:39] secoif: joshsmith yep, before .connect because the connect funciton itself might be throwing the error

[02:45] joshsmith: so I need to be explicitly closing the clients
[02:45] context: if the process dies it closes the connection
[02:45] context: how many damn connections do you have
[02:45] context: you should only need one per node process
[02:45] joshsmith: no idea
[02:46] joshsmith: I'm specifying the connection in each model I have...
[02:46] secoif: joshsmith yeah, I wouldn't do that
[02:46] joshsmith: there are only two models
[02:46] joshsmith: how should I be structuring it?
[02:47] joshsmith: in the README of node-postgres there's a spot where he calls client.end()
[02:47] joshsmith: should I be doing that ever?
[02:47] secoif: I'd probably set up the connection as the app boots
[02:48] joshsmith: and then call it how?
[02:48] joshsmith: I want it to be available in the models

[02:53] tbranyen: garann: fs.readFileSync("filename").toString() would be what you are expecting

[04:07] joshkehn: weizhong: What kind of website?
[04:09] weizhong: a site will allow people to play online game, use four card to calculate to 24
[04:09] ciju has joined the channel
[04:10] weizhong: in my mind it needs login, friend management, and maybe 2d animation
[04:11] boehm has joined the channel
[04:11] weizhong: a small site for excecise purpose only
[04:11] weizhong: so do you have any recommendation?
[04:11] joshkehn: Not really.

[04:40] deedubs: I'm attempting to extend should.js can anyone see why this would cause double failures? http://hastebin.com/Fv9RTWNLYl.js
[04:40] r04r has joined the channel
[04:40] benvie: yes it can if they're compiled for it
[04:41] Guest48248: is there some switch to indicate what OS I am compiling for or something?
[04:41] benvie: some modules rely on libraries that would need to be proted to windows
[04:41] Guest48248: the source code is straight from the nodejs docs
[04:41] benvie: some just need to be commpiled is VC++ and that's it
[04:41] benvie: windows doesn't have a portable build system yet though
[04:42] benvie: on the other hand binaries are nearly 100% portable
[04:42] benvie: so they can be distributed once you make them
[04:42] benvie: those two things are related...

[04:43] Guest48248: Sorry, I don't completely understand.. How do I compile a .node file with VC++? Is that something I would change in wscript?
[04:44] benvie: no
[04:44] benvie: on windows you need to compile vis Microsoft Vidual C++ (mostly)
[04:44] benvie: which most people don't have
[04:44] benvie: however once you are able to compile the binary, assuming you want to distribute it, then it will work on any Windowxs computer that can run node
[04:44] Guest48248: am I trying to get a .dll or an .exe out of that?
[04:45] benvie: a .node is a .dll named funny
[04:45] benvie: on windows
[04:45] Guest48248: ohh, ok. I'll try that out then :)
[04:45] benvie: linked against node.lib which you get compiling node
[04:45] ecin has joined the channel
[04:45] Guest48248: ok, thanks
[04:45] brianseeders has joined the channel
[04:45] benvie: one more
[04:45] Guest48248: also, what did you mean by a 'portable build system'?
[04:46] r04r has joined the channel
[04:46] benvie: https://github.com/springmeyer/hello-gyp
[04:46] benvie: portable as in you could expect your users to be able to compile it
[04:46] benvie: and especially regardless of their system
[04:46] benvie: which is basically true for the old build system on not-windows
[04:47] benvie: but compiling is generally not something you expect is doable on any given windows PC
[04:47] benvie: since they don't necessarily have the stuff to even do it
[04:47] benvie: probably don't
[04:47] benvie: but the upshot is you can more easily distribute binaries that will work
[04:48] ecin_ has joined the channel
[04:49] jacobolus has joined the channel
[04:49] benvie: and I was just commenting that those facts are related. Windows took the path of making an OS where you could compile once run anywhere, and that's related to why most people on Windows don't have the tools or experience to do it
[04:49] benvie: when it's trivial and built into unix
[04:49] Guest48248: hm, why does compiling anywhere make it hard to run anywhere?
[04:49] benvie: and prebuilt binaries are far from trivial
[04:49] benvie: less so now
[04:50] benvie: but you don't expect to get much breadth for a binary in linux or even OS X. You can eun basically anything compiled today on Windows XP SP3 a decade old

[04:51] Guest48248: why does being able to compile everywhere mean that it will be hard to run anywhere?
[04:51] benvie: they're just related to one another
[04:52] benvie: it was necessary to compile your own software since time began using unix
[04:52] benvie: it became part of the way things were done
[04:52] nrdb: can anyone tell me why when I compile with these commands http://paste.debian.net/147760/ ... everything compiles OK ... but when I run node (without installing, as a test) ... "node-v0.6.3# ./node" I get an "Illegal instruction" ?
[04:53] benvie: it wasn't a problem to fix so much. Effort was put into making sure every system had the tools to compile things
[04:53] benvie: and users expected and had to compile things
[04:53] benvie: so those things become intertwined
[04:53] MatthewS has joined the channel
[04:53] benvie: on Windows the opposite evolved

[04:53] kazupon has joined the channel
[04:53] benvie: compiling is an alien thing, but you expect to compile once and barely worry about itunless you're making video games
[04:54] benvie: a tiny subset of people on windows even have compilers
[04:54] nrdb: ACTION and they cost big
[04:54] Guest48248: yeah, only developers would have compilers - and that seems normal to me actually lol
[04:54] benvie: so it'd be stupid of you to expect your users to compile things
[04:54] benvie: people who have always used unix see the opposite
[04:55] Kunda has joined the channel
[04:55] benvie: every single computer has a whole set of tools and it's required
[04:55] benvie: fortunately both ways works, but it makes things more complicated for the heroic few who try to do both sides
[04:56] benvie: like our node creators =D
[04:56] Guest48248: Does it make deploying Linux apps much harder?
[04:56] Guest48248: lol
[04:56] benvie: well as it is
[04:56] nrdb: to many small variations in what each has installed.
[04:56] benvie: it's not too difficult on either side
[04:56] benvie: but making a single system that works for both
[04:57] jerrysv has joined the channel
[04:57] benvie: node provides a unified system so catoring to those completely opposite ways is complicated

[04:59] benvie: nono it's here
[04:59] benvie: that's the cool thing about node
[05:00] benvie: they've done such a great job in providing a top quality on both sides
[05:00] benvie: on windows it's much more recent so the community and knowledge is lopsided
[05:00] benvie: but there's a few of us
[05:00] Z3R0: well... I'm using the latest -win on windows 7... everything about this installation worked fine on my work pc on windows xp... but for some reason using the "simplechat" tutorial files, I can't see to get my client to load localhost:8000/socket.io/socket.io.js // netstat shows it infi-looping until it times out
[05:00] benvie: a lot more every day since it works as good on windows as it does in linux and mac
[05:01] lulzilla has joined the channel
[05:01] benvie: you're connecting from localhost?
[05:01] Z3R0: basically just testing stuff and yes
[05:01] benvie: and you have a new node version
[05:01] benvie: 0.6.x
[05:01] Z3R0: again, worked flawlessly on winxp
[05:01] Z3R0: 0.6.3.1 I believe
[05:01] Z3R0: same install, same files, same setup
[05:01] indexzero has joined the channel
[05:02] Z3R0: I thought originally it may be ipv6, so I disabled that, and modified my hosts file to make sure localhost resolves to 127.0.0.1 (ok done) still nothing
[05:02] benvie: it's almost definitely going to be a configuration problem with either the browser or the socket.io server
[05:02] benvie: like 99% chance
[05:02] Z3R0: well the socket.io server is pre-installed as a namespace with nodejs-win
[05:02] benvie: it's not
[05:02] benvie: node comes with awesome tools
[05:03] Z3R0: you sure? I didn't install anything but nodejs-win on my xp machine, and it loads just fine
[05:03] benvie: it comes with http, https, dns, tls, etc.
[05:03] benvie: but socket.io is a module
[05:03] benvie: third party module for supporting various types of ways to connect to a browser
[05:03] Z3R0: and resolves the localhost:8000/socket.io/socket.io.js // even though it doesn't exist in my /www/
[05:03] benvie: it uses that built in stuff and gives you extra on top
[05:04] benvie: when you say you did it on windows xp
[05:04] benvie: you were serving from windows xp and then connecting on that same computer to itself
[05:04] Z3R0: XP: installed nodejs-win 0.6.3.1 -> program files / nodejs (ran server with server.js file from simplechat)
[05:04] Z3R0: made client.html in /htdocs/ on my localhost apache server
[05:04] Z3R0: browser -> localhost/client.html
[05:04] Z3R0: worked fine
[05:04] benvie: ok 
[05:05] Z3R0: Win7: Duplicated setup exactly
[05:05] Z3R0: socket.io won't laod
[05:05] benvie: so apache is a thing
[05:05] benvie: that fucks things up and is complicated
[05:05] Z3R0: hmmm I do have diff version of apache I believe
[05:05] benvie: do this
[05:05] benvie: simple test
[05:05] benvie: double click on node
[05:05] Z3R0: I love simple tests...
[05:06] Z3R0: node.exe?
[05:06] willwhite has joined the channel
[05:06] Z3R0: ok done, opened (i believe this is the js interpreter window)

[05:07] benvie: sec
[05:07] Z3R0: god if you solve this I will be so happy right now lol
[05:08] benvie: require('http').createServer(function(x){console.log(x)}).listen(8000)
[05:08] Z3R0: although, this weekend, I think I'll just setup a vm and get everything
[05:08] benvie: then go to http://localhost:8000 in a browser
[05:08] Z3R0: uh it listed a whole bunch of crap
[05:09] benvie: it worked ;)
[05:09] Z3R0: I guesS?
[05:09] benvie: node is that exe
[05:09] benvie: that's all node is
[05:09] benvie: it has a lot of stuff built INTO it
[05:09] benvie: like require('http')
[05:09] Z3R0: yes, the server runs just fine
[05:09] Z3R0: but my client fails to retrieve the socket.io.js from localhost:8000
[05:09] benvie: so socket.io
[05:09] Z3R0: whoa
[05:10] benvie: this is a module you get using npm
[05:10] benvie: or github
[05:10] benvie: you'd need node to find where it is, it's going to be external javasccript files
[05:10] benvie: require('http') is inside node.exe but socket.io isn't
[05:10] Z3R0: hmmm...
[05:10] benvie: it's a bunch of javascript files that you usually get using npm
[05:10] Z3R0: wonder why it worked on my other pc then
[05:11] benvie: which now comes with node when you use the node installer
[05:11] benvie: you would do like
[05:11] benvie: npm install socket.io
[05:11] Z3R0: but this is windows... there is no npm is there?
[05:11] benvie: and it'll grab it off the internet for you and put it in your node_modules directory
[05:11] benvie: as of the last week or so it now installs with node
[05:12] benvie: http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.6.4/node-v0.6.4.msi
[05:12] Z3R0: o.o
[05:12] Z3R0: new node
[05:12] benvie: that'll put node in program files, and npm will be in node/node_modules/npm
[05:12] Z3R0: i'm stil really confused why it worked on xp
[05:12] Z3R0: without me downloading or doing anything with socket.io
[05:12] benvie: then you can open cmd there do stuff like npm search sockets
[05:13] benvie: well
[05:13] benvie: apache was doing stuff
[05:13] benvie: probably more than you realized
[05:13] benvie: socket.io is half server half client
[05:13] benvie: it can do either half alone if you have some other thing doing the server part
[05:14] benvie: and it supports transports that are web standards
[05:14] Z3R0: ok, so installed 6.4
[05:14] benvie: ok yeah I don't know if there's a convenient way to pull up npm otherwise but
[05:14] benvie: if you run
[05:15] benvie: cmd and then cd c:/Program Files(x86)/node/npm
[05:15] benvie: you can run npm
[05:15] benvie: I haven't actually installed it that way so I don't know if it sets up so you can run npm anywhere
[05:15] benvie: but it might just work straight from run
[05:15] Z3R0: well I'm in the directory of /nodejs/
[05:15] Z3R0: I just run it from there, because it's easier lol
[05:15] benvie: yeah that works
[05:15] Z3R0: npm alone, shows a bunch of commands
[05:16] benvie: no node_modules folder in there? Is this a new install?
[05:16] benvie: it should end up in program files
[05:16] Z3R0: well I overwrote the other one
[05:16] Z3R0: so there's a bunch there atm
[05:16] benvie: oh npm worked
[05:16] benvie: cool
[05:16] benvie: npm install socket.io
[05:16] slifty has joined the channel
[05:16] Z3R0: let me make it a fresh install I have a feeling something I had before is conflicting
[05:17] benvie: and it'll then be available from node by doing var socketio = require('socket.io') in your js
[05:17] benvie: it'll takes like 30 seconds to install
[05:19] catshirt has joined the channel
[05:19] Z3R0: how do I know if it's installing?
[05:19] Z3R0: I did "npm install socket.io" and it just has a blinking cursor
[05:19] benvie: yeah it's working then
[05:19] fastest963: its probably downloading it
[05:19] benvie: needs better feedback
[05:19] Z3R0: ya verbose mode ;)
[05:19] benvie: it'll screem if it's broken
[05:19] benvie: npm knows how to do that
[05:20] Z3R0: either my net sucks or this takes a while lol
[05:21] benvie: socket.io is a very hefty one
[05:21] benvie: the way node modules are
[05:21] aaditmshah has joined the channel
[05:21] langworthy has joined the channel
[05:21] benvie: they mostly each implement one thing very well and then require other modules
[05:22] benvie: socket.io does a lot, but it does that by having a buttload of other dependencies
[05:22] benvie: if you go into its folder you'll find node_mofules folder in it
[05:22] benvie: and probably all told like 20 more modules
[05:22] Z3R0: yes
[05:22] benvie: so it's getting all of those
[05:22] benvie: but they'll also be cached
[05:22] Z3R0: oh ok
[05:22] benvie: and there's a set that are used in a ton of stuff
[05:22] Z3R0: so it IS doing something
[05:22] aaditmshah: @benvie - Hey, I have some doubts about root, GLOBAL, and global.
[05:23] benvie: boiletplate type modules that you'll now have cached
[05:23] benvie: which part?
[05:23] lorfds has joined the channel
[05:23] aaditmshah: First, is root and GLOBAL always the same?
[05:23] ericmuyser has joined the channel
[05:23] benvie: those come into play when vm is used, which happens when the repl isn't run globally, when you're running things in the vm, or when node is configured to run modules in their own context
[05:24] benvie: sec lemme pull up the code for it
[05:24] benvie: i don't know of a place that root is reassigned. It can be not availablr to you, or you could be given a fake one if someone decides to do that with vm
[05:24] benvie: same for global
[05:24] benvie: GLOBAL
[05:24] benvie: but it's not done by anything in node core
[05:24] lulzilla: is socket,io limited only to port 80?
[05:25] lulzilla: or can it connect to any port?
[05:25] benvie: shouldn't be limited
[05:25] davidban_ has joined the channel
[05:25] lulzilla: anyone confirmation?
[05:25] benvie: depends on the transport
[05:25] benvie: websockets have no limitation in their protocol 
[05:25] lulzilla: ok
[05:25] Z3R0: I was about to say, I used 8000 lol
[05:25] aaditmshah: Alright, so the only foolproof way to get to the global object is to recursively use the Object.getPrototypeOf method on this?
[05:26] benvie: that doesn't even work
[05:26] benvie: example, if you run the repl not globally
[05:26] aaditmshah: Ah, right... that only works in RingoJS.
[05:26] nrdb: can anyone tell me why when I compile with these commands http://paste.debian.net/147760/ ... everything compiles OK ... but when I run node (without installing, as a test) ... "node-v0.6.3# ./node" I get an "Illegal instruction" ?
[05:26] benvie: which is like vm.runInNewContext I think
[05:27] benvie: any Object reference you get is going to be limited
[05:27] ericmuyser has joined the channel
[05:27] aaditmshah: Hmm... would you suggest me how to define the global object in node.js then?
[05:27] benvie: in that it won't be the same Object.prototoype that other objects you see in your context inherit from
[05:27] aaditmshah: I'm really confused.
[05:27] benvie: like I had issues specifically with that
[05:27] fastest963: wait, I missed what you need to put in the global scope
[05:27] benvie: I couldn't add things to prototypes of things that were provided in the context
[05:27] aaditmshah: Oh, alright.
[05:28] benvie: like this was stuff for my own utility
[05:28] benvie: so adding things to native prototypes is a no brainer
[05:28] benvie: I was running the REPL using repl-utils or edit or some helper module
[05:28] aaditmshah: So, that's not entirely possible in node?
[05:28] fastest963: nrdb: what happens when you run make test?
[05:28] benvie: which was running it as non global, and then adding the global context to the repl context
[05:28] benvie: so I could see the global context
[05:29] benvie: but there was an invisible barrier in actually editing it
[05:29] mike5w3c_ has joined the channel
[05:29] benvie: I could do tab completion on Object.
[05:29] benvie: or root.Object.
[05:29] benvie: but root.Object === undefined
[05:29] Z3R0: where woudl it create a socket.io folder?
[05:30] aaditmshah: Why does that happen?
[05:30] Z3R0: it just hangs there, don't see anything being modified or added to file structure during this time

[05:30] caffine has joined the channel
[05:30] nrdb: fastest963, when I run "make test" every test fails with a "--- CRASHED ---"
[05:31] benvie: it's because node's current implementation of vm and controlling contexts/sandbox is a hack
[05:31] Z3R0: users/me/.npm* doesn't exist :(
[05:31] nrdb: fastest963, with a "[00:12|% 100|+   0|- 300]: Done" at the end
[05:31] benvie: oh no dot
[05:31] benvie: npm-cache
[05:31] aaditmshah: I don't guess Ryan is going to fix that anytime soon?
[05:32] benvie: it'll be fixed for 0.8

[05:32] aaditmshah: That's good. I hope root and global are documented properly. It really bugs me.
[05:32] benvie: if you had like NODE_PATH in your env or somethig
[05:32] Z3R0: but empty as well
[05:32] Z3R0: hmmm....
[05:32] benvie: yeah isolates are great
[05:32] NetRoY has joined the channel
[05:33] fastest963: sorry nrdb no idea :/
[05:33] benvie: and v8 went crazy with them in 3.8
[05:33] benvie: they use isolated for goddamn everything and they work well
[05:33] Z3R0: only 1 node_path
[05:33] Z3R0: well 2 one each temp, and tmp
[05:33] Z3R0: both pointing to same /nodejs/node_modules
[05:33] benvie: there's some crazy things coming once the new v8 gets pulled in and they do their magic for 0.8
[05:33] aaditmshah: Anyway, I gtg. So thanks for your time.
[05:33] benvie: np night
[05:34] benvie: anything in there?
[05:34] Z3R0: just npm
[05:34] benvie: check
[05:34] benvie: if there's a npm/node_modules
[05:34] nrdb: fastest963, Do you know that the extra options is correct?
[05:34] benvie: well there is
[05:34] benvie: but check in it
[05:34] Z3R0: command: npm install socket.io ? right
[05:34] benvie: it might have ended up under npm
[05:34] satyr has joined the channel
[05:34] chjj has joined the channel
[05:34] benvie: npm is itself a module
[05:34] Z3R0: nothing there either, it just hangs
[05:34] benvie: and it has a node_modules folder which it uses
[05:35] benvie: if npm never returns
[05:35] benvie: just sits there dead
[05:35] benvie: then either your computer is busted or node is
[05:35] benvie: er npm
[05:35] Z3R0: hmm...
[05:35] benvie: try doing a less big module
[05:35] benvie: install like
[05:35] benvie: npm install color
[05:36] benvie: npm help, npm search toast
[05:36] benvie: npm ls
[05:36] benvie: should list stuff if it exists
[05:36] NetSkay has joined the channel
[05:37] Z3R0: buliding index for first time
[05:37] Z3R0: currently asked to be patient
[05:38] benvie: yeah there's like 4000 modules
[05:38] fastest963: nrdb: https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/1566 can you find anything in there?
[05:39] benvie: npm still isn't 100% yet
[05:40] benvie: getting there 
[05:40] Z3R0: is there another way to get it ?
[05:40] benvie: no I mean, the windows version
[05:40] benvie: is newish and has been heavily worked on
[05:40] Z3R0: I know, I mean is there another way to download socket.io (files and dependencies)?
[05:40] benvie: so it's finally just getting to be reliable enough
[05:40] benvie: yeah just you'll have to manually hunt them down one by one
[05:41] benvie: I haven't used another manager so I don't know what the state of windows ones is like
[05:41] benvie: most modules are on github
[05:41] Z3R0: hmmm the -win i must've downloaded on my xp must've had it pre-compiled
[05:41] benvie: and they all have module.json that lists their exact dependencies
[05:41] Z3R0: because i didn't have to do this at all, and it worked right out of the box
[05:41] benvie: so just a matter of doing a little bit of github searching
[05:42] benvie: I know they exist but can't say much
[05:42] benvie: search npm for package manager =D
[05:42] Z3R0: ERR! Couldn't read dependencies.
[05:42] Z3R0: ERR! Error: ENOENT, no such file or directory 'c:\Program Files\NodeJS\package.json'

[05:43] benvie: er I mean like
[05:43] benvie: https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io
[05:43] benvie: in the base of that is package.json
[05:43] benvie: and there will be one in every node module also
[05:44] benvie: https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io/blob/master/package.json
[05:44] nrdb: fastest963, this was linked to from there http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6788768/cannot-build-node-on-sheevaplug-armv5t-with-debian-squeeze and in that it said someone solved a very similar problem by using version 0.4.10.... do you think I should go back to an older version?
[05:44] duffman: anyone mind explaining what any of this means to someone new to node.js ? http://pastebin.com/7eXGFWe8

[05:46] benvie: was the the secret key in quotes?
[05:47] benvie: yuo can use a hex literal like that
[05:47] duffman:  i haven't edited the original server.js 
[05:47] benvie:  any context for this?
[05:48] duffman: it's identical to : https://github.com/atmos/camo/blob/master/server.js
[05:48] Z3R0: oooo
[05:48] Z3R0: I found it
[05:48] mikeal has joined the channel
[05:48] Z3R0: installed under my htdocs/nodejs didn't realize that was still there
[05:48] Z3R0: wasn't listed in any of my PATH or NODE_PATh though
[05:48] benvie: yeah I figured it was something like that
[05:49] nrdb: fastest963, the 'latest' has changed now to version 0.6.4 today
[05:49] Z3R0: is there anyway to clear all the path's and node_path quickly ?
[05:49] Z3R0: I have a feeling all these multiple installations are screwing with me
[05:50] benvie: that code's probably doing something that's not the correct syntax anymore
[05:50] duffman: benvie ok :(
[05:50] benvie: the whole io/net thing was redone between then and now
[05:50] davidascher has joined the channel
[05:50] crcn has joined the channel
[05:50] benvie: yeah
[05:51] benvie: it's trying to use a file descriptor when it writes to disk

[05:51] benvie: or wait maybe no
[05:51] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[05:51] benvie: it might just be
[05:51] benvie: it's using an octal literal, 0600
[05:51] benvie: change that 384
[05:52] duffman: same error.
[05:52] benvie: oh yeah and it is trying to use a file descriptor. So it's just that whole chunk at the end

[05:53] duffman: ok
[05:53] benvie: find some other example for writing to disk
[05:53] benvie: that part's broke
[05:53] duffman: now it's running :)
[05:53] k1ttty has joined the channel
[05:54] benvie: in the process of normalizing between *nix and windows, file descriptor support was dropped. Buffer provide a better abstraction usually anyway
[05:54] benvie: buffers and streams
[05:55] zilch_ has joined the channel
[05:55] duffman: thank you for your patience and help, i would have not figured this one out any time soon.
[05:55] duffman: i was starting to look into missing modules and what not.
[05:55] duffman: you saved me :)
[05:56] benvie: yeah you would never figure that one out because it's so small and obscure and everything else was right
[05:57] nrdb: fastest963, trying again with the latest version 0.6.4 if that doesn't work I will try earlier version and see if it that works.
[05:57] benvie: node is awesome but it has this funny hidden problem
[05:57] benvie: there's a lot of writing out there that is just right enough to look right
[05:57] benvie: and just wrong enough to be completely broken
[05:57] duffman: case in point: this.
[05:58] duffman: Especially with a commit about 4 months ago i thought it would be recent enough.
[05:58] benvie: yeah. 0.6 was a huge huge change. This shouldn't be a problem going forward
[05:58] benvie: but bringing full support to windows from only supporrting linux before makes it understandable
[05:58] T1234 has joined the channel
[05:58] benvie: yeah no
[05:58] duffman: I really like how lightweight node is, atleast this is what it looks like to a novice.

[05:58] zilch_ has joined the channel
[05:58] jxie has joined the channel
[05:58] duffman: windows :( 
[05:59] benvie: or 90& right, and 10% wrong enough to be broken
[05:59] benvie: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.6.4/api
[05:59] benvie: at this point if it's not like a new article, the node docs are the best bet
[05:59] benvie: for a while
[05:59] duffman: do you contribute to node.js? 
[06:00] duffman: besides being awesome in the irc channel that is :P
[06:00] benvie: starting to now. I hadn't until recently, just doing my own things
[06:00] benvie: but the more I do the more I end up finding things I need node to have fixed
[06:00] benvie: or get support for
[06:00] CiRlE has joined the channel
[06:00] duffman: so you end up fixing them.
[06:00] benvie: and have learned enough about it pouring over its source a thousand times trying to figure out why my stuff is broken
[06:01] benvie: so that I know it like my own project, so if I find something I fix it
[06:01] benvie: https://github.com/Benvie/node
[06:01] duffman: that's awesome.
[06:01] benvie: like I have this version i compiled with the new V8
[06:02] benvie: because I'm doing a lot of stuff with the ES6 Harmony things and also v8's isolates
[06:02] benvie: and found various bugs along the way to getting that going correctly
[06:03] nrdb: what does the snapshot feature do?
[06:03] duffman: he last few lines besides v8 went straight over my head.
[06:03] benvie: it's a cache of all the stuff in the javascript context
[06:03] benvie: like all the functions, Object, Array, process, etc.
[06:04] benvie: instead of building that whole that whole structure up
[06:04] benvie: reparsing all the functions, etc.
[06:04] benvie: it does it once, then snapshots the memory
[06:05] benvie: it's a bigger deal in browsers when you h ave like 300 DOM prototypes to load on every page

[06:06] benvie: yeah
[06:06] benvie: it works on iphone and android ;)
[06:06] Z3R0: ok, so i'll read up on how ot do this via linux lol
[06:07] Z3R0: this is too crazy for me, and I'll just test alot at work
[06:07] Z3R0: don't know what's up with this machine
[06:07] benvie: yeah I mean
[06:07] Z3R0: apparently we were using a forked version (which included socket.io)
[06:07] benvie: it used to be a pain but now it runs really smoothly on windows, node and npm
[06:07] Z3R0: which is why my original worked just fine
[06:07] Z3R0: but for some reason it's not now, and I can't get socket.io to work with a regular installation
[06:07] benvie: well
[06:07] benvie: if you do
[06:08] benvie: run "env"
[06:08] benvie: delete NODE_PATH
[06:08] Z3R0: did already
[06:08] benvie: ah
[06:08] Z3R0: killed NODE_PATH killed all paths in path that pointed to any node
[06:08] Z3R0: reinstalled
[06:08] Z3R0: still nothing
[06:08] benvie: there's also
[06:08] benvie: in your user folder or somewhere from before

[12:07] augustl: eldios: it pleases me that the TDD book is on your list

[12:08] augustl: squeeks: not sure what you mean by finding js libs bootstrapped at runtime
[12:08] augustl: eldios: my partner in crime over at busterjs.org did ;)

[12:08] squeeks: get to their source.
[12:09] augustl: squeeks: in order to do what?
[12:09] eldios: that was one of the must-buy since I think I'm really missing something on the test-driven development
[12:09] squeeks: augustl: building a deep inspecting profiler.
[12:09] augustl: eldios: automated testing at least, if not TDD

[12:10] squeeks: basically taking the output from v8's profiler, and I want to be able to profile node's own internal code as well, and show source towards the slow bits, since v8 shows file/line number

[12:13] augustl: squeeks: it's compiled in
[12:13] squeeks: :(

[12:50] Glenjamin: when you say TDD, do you mean unit tests first?
[12:50] booyaa: the unit tests you write create the code
[12:51] Glenjamin: i often find when starting a new project, doing pure TDD, unit tests to code make it difficult to prototype/refactor quickly

[12:51] cognominal_ has joined the channel
[12:52] Morkel has joined the channel
[12:52] squeeks: TDD is more geared towards meeting the required specification. If you're not sure how you're going to structure things, both TDD and BDD suck.
[12:52] Glenjamin: TDD is geared towards implementation, because a proper unit test can only test a single unit. no dependencies

[13:08] augustl: BDD isn't really "over" TDD..
[13:08] augustl: BDD is really TDD with a twist, no?
[13:08] Glenjamin: depends what you mean by TDD i guess, yeah
[13:08] Glenjamin: it generally comes down to the fact that very few "unit tests" are actually true unit tests
[13:09] jldbasa has joined the channel
[13:10] Ezku: Glenjamin: do elaborate :o
[13:11] Glenjamin: if a test operates on more than one unit, its not a unit test
[13:11] Glenjamin: true unit tests are tried to implementation
[13:11] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[13:12] Glenjamin: and at the early stage of a project, when many things are subject to change, i reckon that value provided by such tests is low in most cases - assuming you have BDD-style integration tests

[13:14] augustl: Glenjamin: how are true unit tests tied to implementations?

[14:05] jarek has joined the channel
[14:06] Venom_X has joined the channel

[16:13] guidocalvano: question is how?
[16:13] julien_: does anyone know if/how that could be done (process wide obviously, not just in a context)
[16:13] squeeks: julien_: you want to mock a nameserver?
[16:13] mandric has joined the channel
[16:13] guidocalvano: I do that by defining my modules using functions
[16:13] julien_: squeaks not reallyâ€¦ somewhere in my app a dependency does an srv resolution

[16:19] atriv: booyaa: thank you
[16:19] guidocalvano: http://pastebin.com/ETcxsbEJ
[16:19] guidocalvano: check this code out
[16:19] zomg: bnoordhuis: regarding errno 110, what sort of testcase would you need for this?
[16:19] criswell has joined the channel
[16:19] guidocalvano: it assumes you use require js
[16:20] guidocalvano: but you can pull the same trick with conventional exports based code
[16:20] shiawuen has joined the channel
[16:20] bnoordhuis: zomg: something that dies with errno 110 :)
[16:20] zomg: As far as I can tell it's any net.Socket
[16:21] guidocalvano: the key to that snippet is that you create your module using a function that is actually added as a member to the module object
[16:21] zomg: Currently looks like it's because of node-irc and it trying to connect to undernet1.irc.quakenet.org
[16:21] blueadept` has joined the channel
[16:21] zomg: erm underworld1.no.quakenet.org
[16:21] zomg: on port 6667
[16:21] bnoordhuis: zomg: can you post a snippet that i can copy/paste/run?
[16:22] zomg: Well it's not doing it anymore... :D
[16:22] guidocalvano: so if I require that module, then at a later point in time I can use that function to reinstantiate another version of that module. But because the dependencies of the module are passed to its factory function via its arguments, it is also possible to pass mock objects
[16:22] zomg: It would appear that you just need to net.createConnection, and then it fails, causing the error
[16:23] jocafa has joined the channel
[16:23] guidocalvano: and thus instantiate the module in an environment that is completely or, if you prefer, partially mocked
[16:23] zomg: bnoordhuis: I'll see if I can repro it with some sort of hack which causes the connection to die before it opens
[16:23] guidocalvano: julien_: do you get it?
[16:23] bnoordhuis: zomg: cool
[16:24] guidocalvano: hey ben, how are things going?
[16:24] julien_: guidocalvano : yup
[16:24] julien_: guidocalvano : thxâ€¦ I thinkI got it and it works :)
[16:24] booyaa: zomg <-- my 2nd favourite nick, mine obviously being the 1st
[16:24] guidocalvano: julien_: there is also some extention to requirejs that does what I described, but it didn't work on all situations for me

[19:28] fermion: sarlalian: thanks for the info :-)
[19:28] sarlalian: np, and excellent
[19:28] sarlalian: I'll check out the one you are looking at too
[19:28] joshsmith_: so I'll upload the image to the server, rename the image to an md5 hash of: context + id of context + size, then upload the image to s3
[19:28] fermion: sarlalian: the intent, for what I'm doing, is actually to create another boxcar
[19:28] CarterL has joined the channel
[19:28] fermion: sadly
[19:28] joshsmith_: on a user calling the image, I call the context, id, and  size, try to fetch from S3
[19:29] joshsmith_: if the photo doesn't exist, fetch the original, resize, and place on s3 with a similarly hashed filename
[19:29] baudehlo: joshsmith_: a lot of this depends on how many users you have and what the profile is of people viewing images.
[19:29] joshsmith_: that way if a user uploads a photo, we don't resize the image 10 different ways on the first upload
[19:30] baudehlo: like how often do you need them all resized? If always, then resize on upload, if rarely, resize on view.
[19:30] joshsmith_: it might be rarely, it might be often
[19:30] baudehlo: there are so many strategies.
[19:30] MrNibbles has joined the channel
[19:30] baudehlo: I wrote a gallery app once and opted for the "resize and cache when viewed"
[19:30] joshsmith_: I think it's smarter to go that route
[19:30] sarlalian: fermion: Thats cool, so far as far as my company is concerned, any 3rd party service we can tie into and not have to build ourselves is great
[19:31] joshsmith_: baudehlo: how would you cache? just set the headers in s3 appropriately?
[19:31] zomg: Hrms, I started an app with forever but forever list now claims it isn't running anything, although the app is clearly running :P
[19:31] baudehlo: I dunno, I've never used S3.
[19:31] fermion: sarlalian: I'm definitely going to look at this, though.  It shouldn't matter whether it's a home grown API, imho, but how well it performs and how difficult it is to maintain
[19:31] fermion: I'd prefer to use a 3rd party, we'll see
[19:31] mmalecki: zomg: node v0.6
[19:32] sarlalian: joshsmith: you could use something like hook.io to broadcast an image upload event and do background processing on the images at your leisure
[19:32] zomg: mmalecki: ?
[19:32] mmalecki: zomg: I mean, it's fucked there
[19:32] zomg: Bah, of course :P
[19:32] zomg: Any alternatives which aren't?
[19:32] baudehlo: joshsmith_: and it wasn't a node app. It was Perl. So I just wrote to the filesystem, and if it was cached I could just use sendfile() to attach it to the http stream.
[19:32] mmalecki: zomg: there's my pull request for that
[19:33] mmalecki: or you can wait for a big mothafuckin' rewrite

[23:06] mmalecki: isaacs: I know, just wanted to make sure it's fixed in 0.6.4
[23:06] isaacs: yep
[23:06] isaacs: the issue is that gnutar is garbage.
[23:06] mmalecki: isaacs: ok, awesome. you're the man :)
[23:07] isaacs: it puts around 20kb of \0 at the end of tarballs.
[23:07] isaacs: only 1kb is necessary.
[23:07] mmalecki: wat
[23:07] isaacs: yeah
[23:07] isaacs: so, tar's a weird format.
[23:07] isaacs: you have to endit with 2 blocks of \0
[23:07] isaacs: but you CAN end it with as many null blocks as you want
[23:07] isaacs: and gnutar is very liberal with its null blocks
[23:07] isaacs: and node-tar was thinking "wait, you already ended, why are you giving me more nulls!?!?"
[23:09] mmalecki: well, wow. I don't think I even understand how tar works, really
[23:09] mmalecki: but indeed, it's weird
[23:09] isaacs: it's not that complicated, really.  just old.
[23:09] isaacs: so there's a lot of different implementation specific bs
