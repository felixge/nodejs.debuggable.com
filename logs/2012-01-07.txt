[00:00] ben_alman: mc i have in the past, but i've recently stopped
[00:00] mc: i was tasked with researching it, thought i'd see what other people are doing
[00:00] mc: why'd you stop? for code cleanliness?
[00:00] konobi: i generally write docs by hand
[00:00] ben_alman: because it yields too high of a comment-to-code ratio https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-bbq/blob/master/jquery.ba-bbq.js
[00:00] konobi: (using POD or similar)
[00:01] mc: yeah, that's a common complaint
[00:01] ben_alman: i'm going to be writing docs by hand in the future, just not sure how i'm going to go about it
[00:01] konobi: ben_alman: POD is pretty decent
[00:01] ben_alman: maybe textile. unsure, i know i want people to be able to browse docs directly on github
[00:01] mc: konobi: do you have issues with updating code and forgetting to update docs? or have you managed to break that habit?
[00:02] joshsmith: what am I doing wrong here? https://gist.github.com/1573130
[00:02] konobi: mc: i generally update the docs first and then the code
[00:02] gigafied has left the channel
[00:02] mc: makes sense. like test based development
[00:02] konobi: yup

[00:03] ben_alman: ya
[00:03] mc: ben_alman: what tool did you used to use for the auto generation?

[00:04] ben_alman: it did a good job, but not perfect. none of them are
[00:04] mc: right
[00:04] joshsmith: I've tried passing in app to that constructor, passing in app during the require() step
[00:04] joshsmith: nothing seems to work
[00:04] ben_alman: it's impossible to auto-generate docs when you're using arguments
[00:05] konobi: joshsmith: missing comma after the first require?
[00:06] joshsmith: konobi: hah, yes. but that breaks things even more
[00:06] ben_alman: oh wow, github can parse .pod
[00:06] ben_alman: that's pretty sweet
[00:06] ben_alman: never noticed
[00:07] ben_alman: i will definitely check that out
[00:07] konobi: joshsmith: oh... you're called the constructor and sending that back as the export
[00:07] ben_alman: anyone know if there's a javascript pod parser? i'd love to see a preview before committing
[00:07] joshsmith: konobi: what should I be doing?
[00:08] joshsmith: just module.exports = Company; ?
[00:08] konobi: yarp
[00:08] plow: what's the recommended node testing framework?

[00:09] cmr: plow: I like tap
[00:09] plow: cmr: any other good ones I should consider?
[00:09] joshsmith: thanks konobi 
[00:09] cmr: plow: I've heard good things about mocha and nodeunit
[00:09] joshsmith: plow: mocha
[00:09] konobi: joshsmith: of course you then need to pass app in within test.js
[00:09] plow: nodeunit sounds official
[00:09] joshsmith: mocha is super-extensible
[00:09] cmr: It isn't.

[00:10] mmalecki: I like vows and tap

[00:44] teadict: mmalecki: is email the common contact way?
[00:44] mmalecki: TheJH: actually, link me, I haven't seen this thread
[00:44] TooTallNate: TheJH: sessir
[00:44] mmalecki: teadict: github issues
[00:44] teadict: k
[00:44] TooTallNate: "ya" I mean
[00:45] TheJH: mmalecki, http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs/browse_thread/thread/d0720af27dc072f9
[00:45] TheJH: ryah, mmalecki, TooTallNate, that just sounds wrong to me :(
[00:45] TooTallNate: TheJH: I'm sure there will be tools to make it easier
[00:46] TheJH: if the registry does it - mhm, well, ok, works for me. if the user does it - cool. if the dev has to do it: UGLY
[00:46] TooTallNate: like a multi-platform build system in the cloud
[00:46] mmalecki: TheJH: neither it does to me. I can understand some reasoning.
[00:46] mmalecki: but well, it's dirty
[00:46] TheJH: TooTallNate, which would probably be something connected to npm
[00:46] TooTallNate: TheJH: possibly
[00:46] TooTallNate: i'm more inclined to not use npm's bin stuff though
[00:47] TooTallNate: and just bundle all binaries together in the repo
[00:47] TheJH: in the REPO?
[00:47] TheJH: binaries in the repo?
[00:47] TooTallNate: based off the fact that in my native modules, most of the time, the bindings aren't changing
[00:47] TooTallNate: but the JS code is
[00:47] slajax has joined the channel
[00:47] TheJH: uaaaaaah
[00:47] TheJH: still... binaries in the repo...
[00:47] TooTallNate: still though, a multi-platform build-system in the cloud is the 1st step
[00:48] TooTallNate: TheJH: ehh, I'm doing it already
[00:48] TooTallNate: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-weak/tree/master/compiled
[00:48] TooTallNate: i don't think it's that big a deal in the end
[00:48] TooTallNate: and it definitely makes it easier for the end-user
[00:49] TooTallNate: which is what ryah was intending

[00:50] konobi: TooTallNate: npants!
[00:50] monokrome has joined the channel
[00:50] TheJH: TooTallNate, uh... we need some build tools for the devs or for npm or for the users. so, up until now, we let the user side handle it. it should be easier to do it on the target pc than on the devs computer, no?
[00:51] teadict: who's using railwayjs?
[00:51] TooTallNate: konobi: ???
[00:51] konobi: npats even
[00:51] TheJH: so letting the dev do it would just be mad. doing it in the cloud might work... but I still don't really see the benefit
[00:52] TheJH: also, this encourages people to use node without being able to fully contribute to the modules they're using
[00:52] TooTallNate: TheJH: how so?
[00:52] plow: martin_sunset: my god I'm impressed!!!
[00:53] konobi: TooTallNate: npats would be a good first step towards that goal i think
[00:53] mmalecki: I would never commit a binary

[00:58] Jarred: (or better put, bytes)
[00:58] konobi: Jarred: TIAS
[00:58] xtianw: | -------- | <- this big
[00:58] TooTallNate: Jarred: depends on the platform
[00:58] TooTallNate: version
[00:58] TheJH: Jarred, the "node" binary?
[00:58] TooTallNate: etc.

[01:00] TheJH: ryah, we know you're here! :P
[01:00] konobi: c++ has no stable binary interface... so you need to compile your addons with the same compiler used to build node
[01:00] mmalecki: TooTallNate: I've had that debate already. I can understand why he wants to do that - linking is hard and stuff. but I don't feel like checking binaries into repos/making it easy because of poor windows users who can't learn how to fucking compile shit
[01:00] CarterL has joined the channel

[01:01] Jarred: Cortex ARM3 iirc
[01:01] konobi: so armv3?
[01:01] justicefries: xtianw: (not to scale)
[01:02] TooTallNate: mmalecki: it sounds to me like you're resisinting change since it's mainly for the benefit of windows users
[01:02] Jarred: konobi, Probably
[01:02] stride: jarred: is the arduino 1.0 in shops already?
[01:02] mmalecki: chrisdickinson: no :). I refuse to put binaries in any repo. also, have you tried actually compiling thing on one linux distribution and running on another?
[01:02] Jarred: yeah
[01:02] TheJH: chrisdickinson, you/some service/... still has to compile your code to that submodule and bump the version in your repo
[01:02] Jarred: stride, yeah
[01:02] konobi: Jarred: i'd have to check on my ARM box when i get home to get a better size indication
[01:02] mmalecki: TooTallNate: that too :)
[01:02] stride: jarred: oh, nice

[02:11] joshsmith: why is this.company undefined in the create method? https://gist.github.com/7f0634bf31de1aeff8e4
[02:12] eboy: joshsmith: because `this` is not what you think it is
[02:12] eboy: instead of callback(null, result), do callback.call(this, null, result)
[02:13] eboy: callback(err) → callback.call(this, err);
[02:13] joshsmith: eboy: ahhh, the nesting

[02:18] eboy: All of them reall
[02:18] eboy: really*
[02:19] joshsmith: you pass this to *all* your methods?
[02:21] TheJH: that's why coffeescript has a fat arrow :D
[02:22] TheJH: => - bind "this" to parent scope
[02:22] eboy: yes all of them because `this` on a callback should usually represent the object that added the callback
[02:23] eboy: i mean, it should not be surprising what the value of `this` is, and it should not usually be the global object
[02:23] joshsmith: ah, fatrocket makes me like coffeescript some, then

[02:39] fbzhong: TooTallNate: I did try it. However, the req.connection.fd is undefined always in git master branch...
[02:39] TooTallNate: oh ok, then I think the answer is "not anymore"
[02:39] TooTallNate: that code is for < 0.6.0
[02:39] fbzhong: TooTallNate: yes...
[02:40] TooTallNate: i don't think there's a way to get the fd on the current versions of node
[02:40] fbzhong: ...
[02:40] ryanrolds: The FDs shouldn't be going futher then libuv these days.
[02:41] k1ttty has joined the channel
[02:41] TooTallNate: you need a sendfile abstraction for libuv I guess :p
[02:41] fbzhong: It's strange that sendfile will increase performance a log.
[02:41] fbzhong: lol
[02:41] fbzhong: wish they will implement it soon...
[02:41] TooTallNate: not very strange really
[02:41] eboy: Maybe you can pipe the fd
[02:41] fbzhong: oh? how to pipe the fd?
[02:41] ryanrolds: This is a horrible idea, but are you using any of the 0.6.x functionality?
[02:42] eboy: Famous last words
[02:42] joshsmith: how do I run multiple mocha tests in different dirs at once?
[02:42] eboy: "This is a horrible idea, but..."
[02:42] shinuza has joined the channel
[02:42] fbzhong: actually, I am trying to use the node-spdy module, which requires the 0.7.0 in master branch.
[02:43] devongovett has joined the channel
[02:43] fbzhong: the performance of node-spdy seems better when testing with static files.
[02:44] fbzhong: However, it's not good enough. So that is why I am trying to use sendfile in my tests.
[02:44] fbzhong: to get to know the spdy performance improvement in nodes.
[02:45] fbzhong: eboy: Hi, I am wondering to know how to pipe the fd? Do you have more comments on that?
[02:45] TooTallNate: fbzhong: i don't think sendfile would work in your case then anyways
[02:45] eboy: fbzhong: I've never used sendfile but I was throwing a random suggestion
[02:45] TooTallNate: since (I'm assuming) SPDY needs to do other things on the wire
[02:45] eboy: I think there is a pipe function

[03:18] RLa: ryanrolds, tested on xp with node 0.6 and also posted it on the so question
[03:18] ryanrolds: Are you binding your routes in the controllers? It may already be accessable.

[03:20] tomgallacher has joined the channel
[03:20] ryanrolds: Having a specific module you require in to each of your controller files may make more sense.
[03:20] joshsmith: you mean just a small configuration that exports the client?
[03:20] joshsmith: I was worried that'd create a lot of extra code, but it wouldn't be that much extra
[03:21] ryanrolds: You can create single connection or a pool for use by anyone including that module.
[03:22] ryanrolds: By including I mean requiring.
[03:22] joshsmith: which would be better? single or pool?

[03:24] gigafied: and nm, figured it out

[03:25] gigafied: app.configure(function(){this;} != this outside of the closure

[06:23] systemfault: illumina: It doesn't make sense as strings are immutable in JS
[06:25] isaacs has joined the channel
[06:25] illumina: okay let me be more specific than. I am looping through an array and defining accessor properties for each element. I am then using the element string within the anonymous accessor functions. And that "element" variable is being reused across each anonymous function (like a pointer/reference).
[06:25] illumina: I do not want that behavior

[06:27] catb0t:  [{ s: "ab" },{ s: "a" } ]
[06:27] SubStack: that, rather
[06:28] SubStack: whereas if you copy the object reference
[06:28] SubStack: .. var x = { s : 'a' }, y = x; x.s += 'b'; [ x, y ]
[06:28] catb0t:  [{ s: "ab" },{ s: "ab" } ]
[06:28] SubStack: illumina: or it could be a problem with how you're looping
[06:29] SubStack: the async for loop trap
[06:29] SubStack: in which case try swapping for for forEach
[06:29] SubStack: but really without any code it's all speculation
[06:29] illumina: hmm. okay its not async… but i am using coffee. so I suspect it may be doing something stupid along the lines of what you're suggesting. let me inspect the JS
[06:31] SubStack: or just paste the code someplace
[06:32] illumina: okay check it: (this is the coffee) http://pastebin.com/UeAnje5B
[06:32] SubStack: .. var res = []; function push (fn) { process.nextTick(res.push.bind(res, fn)) }; for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) push(function () { return i }); res
[06:32] catb0t:  Exception: ReferenceError: process is not defined
[06:32] SubStack: beh
[06:32] SubStack: illumina: don't use a for loop
[06:33] SubStack: for loops don't close over state
[06:33] SubStack: use a forEach
[06:34] SubStack: or else wrap the whole for body in a (function (key) { ... })(key)

[06:54] nickradford has joined the channel
[06:56] nickradford: Hi, I have a node server, running on my mac fine, but on our ubuntu deployment server, when running `node app` or `cake`, I get "Cannot find module 'zlib'". I'm under NDA, as this is a work project, so will give details where I can. Thanks in advanced :)
[06:56] mashed has joined the channel
[06:58] aidanns has joined the channel
[06:59] RLa: node uses own zlib or system one?
[06:59] nickradford: We actually have no calls to zlib in our codebase. We're using 0.4.7 though, so I'm worried that might be an issue
[07:00] sj26: nickradford: 0.4.7 doesn't look like it includes zlib: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.7/api/
[07:01] herbySk has joined the channel
[07:01] sj26: github's new code browsing styles are really throwing me
[07:01] nickradford: Yeah, I understand that. I'm pretty sure none of our dependencies require zlib (otherwise npm install would fix that). 
[07:02] RLa: hm, 0.6 includes zlib source
[07:02] nickradford: And we've had this server up for a couple months, but some recent change is causing this issue.
[07:03] saikat has joined the channel
[07:03] catshirt has joined the channel
[07:03] RLa: sj26, in older times you needed separate npm package for zlib functionality?
[07:04] nickradford: We're not actively using zlib. A ctrl+f for 'zlib' returns 3 text files, none of which are executable code.
[07:04] sj26: nickradford: can you post your strack trace?
[07:04] nickradford: sure thing
[07:04] isaacs has joined the channel
[07:04] sj26: possible one of your required modules is using zlib
[07:04] nickradford: paste bin or gist, whats the standard here?
[07:04] sj26: and hasn't marked its node dependency properly
[07:04] sj26: I prefer gists
[07:04] nickradford: coolio
[07:06] nickradford: https://gist.github.com/1574066
[07:07] nickradford: I added our package.json in there too
[07:08] sj26: okay, check what /home/qui_test/deploy/qui/node_modules/open.core/lib/src/open.server/util/converters/pygments.coffee line 10 is requiring
[07:08] nickradford: line 10 is actually a comment, which says "See: http://pygments.org/"
[07:09] nickradford: and restler.js line 7 is a new line.
[07:09] catshirt has joined the channel
[07:10] sj26: nickradford: ah, it's basing the line numbers on the compiled javascript, not coffeescript
[07:10] sj26: looks like restler
[07:11] Shaunzie: nickradford: your using coffee script so line numbers won't matchup correctly. Try compiling the coffee script and examining the rendered source
[07:11] nickradford: rastler is raw js
[07:11] sj26: ... and if we look up the strack trace which I didn't do because i'm a tool, /home/qui_test/deploy/qui/node_modules/open.core/node_modules/restler/lib/restler.js line 7
[07:12] nickradford: it's a new line, there is a require on line 6, which requires("./multipart"), part of the raster lib
[07:12] catshirt has joined the channel
[07:13] nickradford: er, restler (it's late for me)
[07:14] nickradford: Shaunzie: line 10 of the compiled pygments.coffee is also a new line, it's previous require statement is for restler.
[07:15] sj26: npm registry seems very slow :-/
[07:16] mdel has joined the channel
[07:17] nickradford: so, if it is restler that requires zlib, and I have zlib1g, zlib1g-dbg, and zlib1g-dev installed on our server, what could the issue be?
[07:18] sj26: restler: zlib      = require('zlib');
[07:18] vguerra has joined the channel
[07:19] sj26: that's a requirement on a nodejs library called zlib
[07:19] metapandava has joined the channel
[07:19] sj26: which is built-in to recent versions of node, but not in 0.4.7
[07:19] nickradford: okay, like version 6.
[07:19] sj26: restler should have a node requirement of later versions
[07:19] nickradford: yes it should, lol
[07:19] nickradford: why is it working fine on my macbook then? I am also developing with 0.4.7
[07:19] _jzl has joined the channel
[07:20] sj26: on your server, do `npm -g install zlib`
[07:20] isaacs: sj26: why?  zlib is built into node now
[07:20] sj26: isaacs: because he's using an old version
[07:20] isaacs: sj26: oh, that
[07:20] isaacs: sure.
[07:20] nickradford: sj26, we are working in 0.4.7, pm's decision
[07:21] sj26: isaacs: I'm also using 0.4 because a bunch of stuff was removed, mainly socket support
[07:21] isaacs: nickradford: your prime minister is making engineering decisions?
[07:21] nickradford: lololol
[07:21] skm has joined the channel
[07:21] isaacs: there is no sane reason to use 0.4.7.
[07:21] nickradford: ;)
[07:21] sj26: i'm using 0.4.13
[07:21] isaacs: even if you are stuck on 0.4, use 0.4.12
[07:21] sj26: 12
[07:21] sj26: rather
[07:21] isaacs: but don't do that.
[07:21] isaacs: seriously.
[07:21] isaacs: 0.6 is much much better.  stabler, faster, more secure.
[07:22] nickradford: I agree, we'll likely be upgrading soon, just wanted to keep things sane while we were doing a bulk of this development.
[07:22] isaacs: more future proof
[07:22] sj26: yes, but removed a bunch of sockets functinoality :-(
[07:22] nickradford: is this *the* issacs?
[07:22] isaacs: ACTION is the isaacs
[07:22] nickradford: I'm quoting you on this, as proof we need to jump ship to 0.6
[07:22] isaacs: sj26: all the sockets functionality removed was unix domain sockets.  (not unix sockets)
[07:22] sj26: isaacs: while you're here, can I add the ttl/broadcast/multicast facilities back into libuv and nodejs?
[07:22] isaacs: sj26: nope.
[07:22] isaacs: sorry
[07:23] sj26: but these are cross platform
[07:23] isaacs: bring it up on the dev list.
[07:23] sj26: windows supports ttl, broadcast and multicast
[07:23] isaacs: the people to convince are ben, bert, and igor.
[07:23] sj26: alternative is to extend something like unix_dgram to support inet too?
[07:23] sj26: (I've been doing both)
[07:24] sj26: otherwise networking stuff like mdns is impossible

[07:26] boltR has joined the channel
[07:26] nickradford: Thanks sj26  and issacs :)
[07:28] nickradford: Would you recommend I contact restler's devs about listing zlib as a requirement?
[07:29] sj26: nickradford: yes, although that's tricky because it depends on the version of node
[07:30] sj26: pretty sure npm can handle that though
[07:30] nickradford: maybe at least updating there wiki
[07:30] isaacs: nickradford: yes.
[07:30] isaacs: nickradford: if they do require("zlib/") (with the slash) then they'll ge the version npm installed, not the native.
[07:30] isaacs: nickradford: but they should probably move to using the native one.
[07:31] isaacs: it's much more tested, doesn't require compilation at install-time, etc.
[07:31] nickradford: as in bumping up the required node version

[08:07] illumina: I'm trying to create fairly complicated parent/child class relationship and I need to do something that is roughly equivalent to defining code in the Parent that runs when the Child is being defined.

[08:11] SomeoneWeird_ has joined the channel
[08:12] illumina: I want to run some code at app-start up time that caches some values in each Child. And the actual class name of the Child is a parameter to the start-up code
[08:12] illumina: (I'm making a database ORM Model base class and want to pre-cache db connections where the child class names are the tables)
[08:13] RLa: and entities should be created using new keyword?
[08:13] davetayls has joined the channel
[08:13] slajax: So why not use typical prototypical inheritance illumina ?
[08:14] RLa: otherwise dependencies could be injected by factory
[08:14] RLa: i.e new MyClass() vs orm.create(MyClass)
[08:14] illumina: slajax: well… i'm using coffeescript. so it has a more typical class hierarchy setup with an *extends* keyword. If this was pure JS I could just put some code where the parent/child relationship is setup.
[08:14] illumina: RLa that is possible. but I am trying to allow the new keyword

[10:21] westo: plow: are there any indication to the costs for joyent?
[10:21] ritch: does that mean socket.io will work over http-proxy 
[10:21] plow: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Node-Hosting
[10:21] mmalecki: ritch: yes
[10:22] plow: westo: $60 per month min
[10:22] plow: westo: I haven't been able to get a free server, says they are used up
[10:23] RLa: why http://www.joyent.com/services/cloudhosting gives 404
[10:24] SubStack: socket.io works with http-proxy
[10:24] plow: mmalecki: when sholud I get an invitation for nodejitsu?
[10:24] RLa: btw, linode vps are 20$ per lowest machine, using these for some projects
[10:24] westo: plow: I was looking at heroku for an app I'm working on but the database add-ons are a little expensive. For this app it will probably cheaper to use EC2 and MySQL.
[10:25] plow: westo: it will always be, a lot are backed by EC2
[10:25] RLa: westo, do you have more specific requirements
[10:25] mmalecki: plow: maybe now :) ?
[10:25] martin_sunset: Westo you can always use external services with heroku like monohq or xeround
[10:25] plow: mmalecki: did you jsut send it ? :)
[10:25] mmalecki: plow: join #nodejitsu, I'll grab some details and activate you
[10:26] plow: mmalecki: thanks!
[10:27] westo: RLa: I'm in the initial stages of developing an app. Very basic data entry type app. Basically just need node and MySQL at this stage.
[10:27] RLa: i guess then vps is cheapest choice
[10:28] RLa: and probably gives most flexibility in your environment
[10:29] westo: RLa: I think so. I'll take a look at linode

[12:28] tiglionabbit_: so the current version of the sqlite package on npm is broken with node 6.x.  However, someone has patched it to work and submitted a pull request that hasn't been accepted yet.  I can download and build it, but how do I install it?
[12:30] mehlah has joined the channel
[12:31] TheJH: tiglionabbit, download it in a seperate directory, then do "sudo npm link" without arguments there
[12:31] TheJH: tiglionabbit, then go into your projects folder and type "npm link qqlite"
[12:32] TheJH: tiglionabbit, that will symlink the package you downloaded instead of downloading the npm version of it
[12:32] TheJH: tiglionabbit, or, alternatively, you can directly install from git
[12:32] TheJH: tiglionabbit, you can even specify the repository as dependency in your package.json
[12:32] TheJH: tiglionabbit, just specify the git:// url
[12:33] TheJH: (but the second approach only works if the patch is on master, I think)
[12:33] tiglionabbit_: I can install directly from git?

[14:39] ben_alman: i just butted in where i wasn't invited really
[14:40] ben_alman: the only thing i want on the constructor is static properties or static utility methods
[14:40] ben_alman: i'd want everything instance-specific to be on the prototype
[14:41] bradleymeck: i meant in, not on sorry
[14:42] bradleymeck: defaults on prototype, instance in constructor, static on constructor, copy operations on prototype or constructor
[14:42] ben_alman: if you have an instance
[14:42] ben_alman: say Bar inherits from Foo
[14:43] ben_alman: and you have an instance of Bar, bar

[15:20] tuhoojabotti: plow: you could just use process.EventEmitter btw
[15:21] plow: tuhoojabotti: is that preferred?
[15:21] tuhoojabotti: I think
[15:21] tuhoojabotti: At least socket.io does so. :P
[15:21] plow: I'll try it instaed
[15:22] tuhoojabotti: plow: Also, I don't think you need to call the constructor of EventEmitter

The context is a corporate intranet, so for example we already have a url "http://intranet" which points to the machines ip address, I then want to resolve "http://intranet/myapp" to point to 127.0.0.1:1337 which is simple enough with something like IIS, but how would I go about this with nodejs?  Apologies if this is simple stuff, I'm not really a DNS guy.
[17:18] MRdNk: or server engineer
[17:19] quijote has joined the channel
[17:19] Lingerance: DNS doesn't point to ports
[17:19] Lingerance: It's just name->IP, nothing more.
[17:20] MRdNk: oh ok.  So how would I go about this task? 
[17:20] Lingerance: IIS does it with a special redirection webserver (usually a full page frame)

I might be able to get a couple of desktop PCs installed with Linux (nginx - might be pushing it), and I know the question I'll be asked is, how do I create a new 'application' name that resolves to the node app.
[17:28] MRdNk: So with IIS, and Visual Studio, you just write your app, open IIS and give it a name (or publish to the server)... and all the node examples I've seen, are type the IP Address and add the port number.
[17:28] MRdNk: - in your browser. 
[17:29] MRdNk: plus - i know nothing about nginx, and I'm guessing the tech team are the same.  If I can do it with IIS, then I might give that a go.

[18:14] nickradford: lietu: I guess it's not exactly a file, if you look at sstephenson/stitch on github, in the compiled js, he has this line: https://github.com/sstephenson/stitch/blob/master/lib/stitch.js#L92. We use it for work, and i've got to run right now. 
[18:16] nickradford: Stitch compiles commonjs modules into a single file, and you can access those modules using a require statement. Using the same notation stitch uses to require those modules, you can later call `require('foo')` and get your foo.js module.

[19:27] augustl: windows does have symlinks
[19:27] augustl: perhaps that's the issue, node only got an API for symlinks on windows in o.6.7

[21:27] bitwalker: delizu: Is that url the one you are loading the page with, or is it a link you are clicking? 
[21:27] delizu: bitwalker: I came a bit further on the problem.
[21:27] delizu: it works fine when I use router.navigate which I should. but if I do a refresh node takes over
[21:28] delizu: I want node to only care about / and that is it. everything else should go trough / and the rest should backbone handle
[21:29] arcanin has joined the channel
[21:29] bitwalker: If you postback, node handles the request. Backbone is intended to intercept the request when a link is clicked. Refreshing the page doesn't give backbone the chance to do so
[21:30] aaronmcadam has joined the channel
[21:31] bitwalker: Ideally, you want node to act as a fallback for backbone routes anyways, in case the user has js disabled

[21:37] rio{ has joined the channel
[21:38] bitwalker: delizu: That's what I've been doing, but if you want pushstate to work,  setup node to handle all of your backbone routes as expected, once the page loads, backbone takes over
[21:39] delizu: bitwalker: that is a solution
[21:41] bitwalker: delizu: honestly, I've been avoiding pushstate due to reported issues on mobile devices, so there's that to consider also fwiw

[21:44] ramkamx: Hi there, i'm new to node js, and need some help on install/uninstall of the node osx pkg (installed it but bcause its a hackintosh, processor is not re ognised, so i compiled from the src, i need to cleanup / remove the previous installs). Any1 coild help ?
[21:45] tbranyen: bitwalker: what version of ios is that
[21:45] delizu: bitwalker: thanks! I will go with the # for now on. thanks alot for the information
[21:45] tbranyen: hard to believe ios 5 has that issue
[21:45] tbranyen: ah ios 4.3
[21:47] Shaunzie: ramkamx: if you installed using make, you should be able to run "make uninstall"

[21:48] joshsmith: anyon here use node-mysql?
[21:48] bitwalker: delizu: np, keep your eyes peeled for fixes to that api though! Hopefully it gets fixed soon
[21:48] Shaunzie: ramkamx: sorry I've never used the installer package :-/

[22:13] isaacs: ramkamx: that's just a copy of where the original lives.
[22:14] isaacs: ramkamx: when you install npm, the npm.cmd should be in your PATH somewhere, usually right next to node.exe
[22:14] isaacs: ramkamx: if you install using the node MSI, it's in %ProgramFiles%\nodejs\npm.cmd, I believe
[22:14] ramkamx: Isaacs: it's osx/bash

[22:18] ramkamx: But you gave me hint, the package contains both nix and win files...
[22:19] ramkamx: While true; do (your command); sleep 1; done
[22:19] isaacs: ramkamx: heh
[22:19] kerigan: that works? ok :)
[22:19] isaacs: ramkamx: the pkg drops everything in /usr/local/
[22:19] ramkamx: While in lowercase
[22:20] isaacs: ramkamx: `make uninstall` in the node source should remove it all
[22:20] isaacs: ramkamx: then `make install` will install it
[22:20] kerigan: is there any good tool then that monitors the node process in case it needs to be restart?
[22:20] ramkamx: Isaacs: the latest version, and the previous version in /usr
[22:20] ramkamx: Ah ok
[22:20] ramkamx: Thx i'll try
[22:21] ramkamx: Kerigan: top
[22:21] ramkamx: Or ps aux
[22:21] isaacs: kerigan: i recommend using whatever process stuff you have on your system.
[22:21] isaacs: ramkamx: i think kerigan means some kind of "if this service goes down, restart it" type thing

[22:25] isaacs: and, i'm not 100% sure, but i'd guess that forever has a bug or two still ;)
[22:25] isaacs: i know node does

[22:25] isaacs: sure
[22:26] mikeal has joined the channel
[22:26] mmalecki: isaacs: but yeah, well, we use it in production, both as an API and as a CLI tool
[22:26] mmalecki: isaacs: I'd say the API is much more stable, maybe because I didn't change it much
[22:28] mmalecki: isaacs: and what do you guys use again?
[22:28] isaacs: mmalecki: smf
[22:28] isaacs: mmalecki: for lots and lots of stuff.
[22:28] mmalecki: ah, right
[22:28] isaacs: i mean, it's a part of smartos, no reason not to use it.
[22:28] isaacs: it's rock solid, with many years of huge production deployments behind it.

[22:30] augustl: isaacs: npm link doesn't work on windows. I'm guessing because node haven't had symlinking support on windows until recently?
[22:30] isaacs: augustl: it has it now?
[22:30] ramkamx: isaacs: Nope, it just dumps the execs, make uninstall finds no rule
[22:30] chrisdickinson: i'd love any thoughts on the matter. especially from folks that get grossed out by coffeescript.
[22:31] augustl: isaacs: yeah, due to different APIs you just need to specify "dir" or "file"
[22:31] augustl: new in 0.6.7
[22:31] isaacs: augustl: oh! that landed! awesome.
[22:31] isaacs: augustl: wanna send me an npm patch that enables link? ;)
[22:31] isaacs: that'd be rad
[22:31] isaacs: i wasn't sure if that got in yet
[22:31] isaacs: i know symlinking to files will fail most of the time, if you're not running cmd in admin mode.
[22:32] augustl: you also need to run the node process as admin for some reason
[22:32] augustl: ya..
[22:32] chrisdickinson: i was also thinking of patching ASI so that "[" and "(" after a newline don't become part of the previous statement.
[22:32] augustl: I tried symlinking dirs, all in my users home directory, but it failed unless I ran as admin
[22:32] augustl: quite silly, I can use the "junction" command as unelevated user

[23:22] wereHamster: kerigan: what does reportTask() return?
[23:22] Brandon_R: we have a troll in the house
[23:22] kerigan: first one executes immediately, the second one waits 5secs
[23:22] TheJH: chjj, for pointers, make an object with one "ref" property :D
[23:22] chjj: TheJH: no, i dont want some half-baked solution!
[23:22] chrisdickinson: chjj: hack it into uglify!
[23:22] kerigan: doesn't return anything
[23:22] chjj: TheJH: i want the real deal
[23:22] Brandon_R: then use a language with pointers
[23:22] wereHamster: kerigan: the first will call whatever object reportTask() returns after 5000ms, the second will call reportTask afture 5000ms
[23:23] jchris has joined the channel
[23:23] wereHamster: kerigan: so the first one won't work
[23:23] chrisdickinson: unless reportTask returns a function.
[23:23] chrisdickinson: in which case the second wouldn't work.
[23:23] wereHamster: kerigan: what you could do is setTimeout(reportTask, 5000), depending on whether you caer what `this` should be in that function
[23:23] kerigan: oh ok i see, thats still weird that it works that way though :)
[23:23] c4milo has joined the channel
[23:23] wereHamster: chrisdickinson: of course it would, the second case dons't care what that function returns
[23:24] TheJH: kerigan, it's not weird. in fact, it's more consistent.
[23:24] chrisdickinson: wereHamster: yes, but it wouldn't work as expected.
[23:24] IrishGringo has joined the channel
[23:24] wereHamster: kerigan: why is it weird? reportTask() calls the function.
[23:24] wereHamster: chrisdickinson: yes, that's true

[23:25] bnoordhuis: kerigan: i personally would not
[23:25] wereHamster: kerigan: the first case is no different than 'var x = reportTask(); setTimeout(x, 5000)'

[23:51] chilts: on that done page you can figure out what message you want
[23:51] chilts: (in fact, you can add a message to the query, but I don't personally do that much)

[23:53] Cheery: does node.js/express or something already have a publishing platform of some sort?
[23:53] Cheery: similar to wordpress or such.
[23:53] chilts: do you mean a CMS?
[23:54] chilts: hmm, not that I know of but there may be things out there ... someone recently did a forum-type site
[23:54] joshsmith: chilts: yeah, I figured I could do it that way. how do you GET the query? req.body?

[23:56] chilts: joshsmith: wouldn't that be a req.query.whatever?
[23:56] joshsmith: ah right
[23:56] joshsmith: I've only worked with post, not get
[23:56] chilts: wait, you can just use req.param I think ... http://expressjs.com/guide.html#req.param()

[23:56] joshsmith: I will, thanks for your thoughts chilts 
[23:57] chilts: no worries :)
