[00:57] igl: o.O
[00:57] justinTNT: you could look for window. or exports.
[00:57] igl: if (process) 
[00:58] gtramont1na: check for 'module' or 'module.exports'? Or check if 'this' is global?
[00:58] justinTNT: or self
[00:58] Marak: !tweet @pgriess We miss you in the #node.js room. :-[
[00:58] kohai: @NodeKohai: @pgriess We miss you in the #node.js room. :-[

[00:58] piscisaureus: some k.... scared him I think
[00:59] Marak: gtramont1na: theres a lot of approaches....
[00:59] Marak: gtramont1na: you might want to use browserify ...
[00:59] Marak: gtramont1na: that way you can actually re-use the code instead of doing a big if / else
[01:00] Marak: gtramont1na: if( typeof exports !== 'undefined' )
[01:00] justinTNT: yeah checkout browserify. if that seems like overkill, just look at exports
[01:00] Marak: will work....kinda...
[01:00] gtramont1na: Marak: Thanks man. I'll check it out.
[01:00] gtramont1na: Thanks!
[01:00] mscdex: if (process && process.version)

[04:58] pquerna: indutny: re: CLI, i mean the CLI is just using the HTTP/resty api underneath;  At somepoint there will probally be pretty webUIs built, but thats not our focus right now
[04:59] gkatsev: tbranyen: ouch. Does the airport have like rooms you can rent? But I guess that's too european.
[04:59] Marak: tbranyen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P2gW7uRpGA
[04:59] tbranyen: gkatsev: yeah for $499 a night
[04:59] gkatsev: seriously?
[04:59] gkatsev: wow
[04:59] Marak: tbranyen: full volue
[04:59] Marak: tbranyen: full volume
[05:00] gkatsev: tbranyen: wow, just wow.
[05:00] tbranyen: lol
[05:00] tbranyen: gkatsev: yup the hotel is pricey
[05:00] kohai: @eunikorn_imz: Everybody seems to be talking about #NodeJS and #npm ... am I the only one too lazy to dive in ?
[05:01] Marak: !tweet @eunikorn_imz Instead of diving in you should just jump on the boat. :-]
[05:01] kohai: @NodeKohai: @eunikorn_imz Instead of diving in you should just jump on the boat. :-]
[05:01] gkatsev: tbranyen: oh, hotel? I guess makes sense. But I mean, like in zurich, they literally had like 10 rooms that had a bed in them that you can rent in 6 hour increments. And it was cheap.
[05:01] tbranyen: heh that so european
[05:01] kohai: @lancefisher: It was only a matter of time until a node.js CMS. Expect many more. This is great! http://calip.so/

[05:02] sechrist: Are you from Texas?
[05:02] sechrist: or just stuck at dfw
[05:02] gkatsev: because it is cheap and exactly what you need for longer layovers
[05:02] gkatsev: sechrist: he's stuck there overnight
[05:02] tbranyen: sechrist: stuck
[05:02] sechrist: oh man worse
[05:02] tbranyen: from boston
[05:02] tbranyen: never coming here again, it hailed a bit and the roads were icy so they cancelled all flgihts

[05:07] Marak: tbranyen: you gonna try out tir and mongrel2 ?
[05:07] Marak: lol
[05:07] tbranyen: i tried them before, they aren't really usable, just making my own thing for now
[05:07] Marak: i hear there is a lua embedded in nginx
[05:08] tbranyen: yeah that sounds more like it
[05:08] Marak: lua in nginx sounds awesome

[05:09] tbranyen: irssi rules
[05:09] sechrist: figured
[05:10] gkatsev: lol
[05:10] gkatsev: what OS?
[05:10] sechrist: i'm tired of my laptop's connectivity affecting the connectivity that people see in here
[05:10] sechrist: closing my lid shouldn't send an event that I left
[05:10] gkatsev: on OSX there is colloloqoqoqoqloloqly

[05:10] sechrist: cololololololollMEMORYHOG
[05:10] gkatsev: lol, is it?
[05:10] sechrist: was last I used it
[05:10] sechrist: compared to limechat
[05:10] gkatsev: I've only heard good things
[05:10] gkatsev: but anyway, irssi ftw

[05:11] Corren_ has joined the channel
[05:11] sechrist: I like my participant list, my channel list, and my chat
[05:11] tbranyen: harder to get simplier than irssi
[05:11] sechrist: and inline images
[05:11] tbranyen: unless you write your own
[05:11] gkatsev: especially vps+screen/tmux+irssi
[05:11] sechrist: irssi has no inline images
[05:11] sechrist: however
[05:11] sechrist: I could pipe into an x11 prog
[05:11] gkatsev: if you like emacs, then erc
[05:11] sechrist: and get the same shit
[05:11] tbranyen: whats that image to ascii generator
[05:11] tbranyen: toilet or something
[05:11] sechrist: ew no
[05:11] sechrist: I like my millions of colors
[05:11] gkatsev: lol
[05:11] sechrist: maybe for a preview
[05:11] tbranyen: cacaview
[05:11] sechrist: before I click and open my x11 prog
[05:11] tbranyen: thats it
[05:11] gkatsev: vim has vimirc for those so inclined
[05:11] sechrist: OH SHI
[05:12] sechrist: I am a total vimguy
[05:12] gkatsev: sechrist: have you seen conque?
[05:12] sechrist: nope
[05:12] gkatsev: it's great
[05:12] gkatsev: allows you to open shells and stuff in vim
[05:12] sechrist: interactive commands
[05:12] sechrist: in my vim
[05:12] gkatsev: `g conque google code
[05:12] gbot2: conque - Run interactive commands inside a Vim ... - Google Code - http://code.google.com/p/conque/
[05:12] sechrist: better than :!r or whatever
[05:13] gkatsev: oh yes, it's the actual shell/interpreter
[05:13] gkatsev: you can open up the node repl as a tab
[05:13] gkatsev: it's great
[05:13] gkatsev: and there is a send to conque tab command as well
[05:13] gkatsev: very useful
[05:13] gkatsev: and you don't need to use emacs
[05:14] gkatsev: that is one of the cools things in emacs. Eval sexpr in repl
[05:15] sechrist: man this is sweet
[05:15] sechrist: so many ideas
[05:15] sechrist: gkatsev++\
[05:15] sechrist: gkatsev++

[05:16] tbranyen: nope looks neato
[05:16] tbranyen: holy crap it looks hot
[05:16] tbranyen: gonna mess with dat
[05:16] gkatsev: yeah, looks neat
[05:16] sechrist: lua
[05:16] sechrist: meeeeeeh
[05:16] gkatsev: and it's lua
[05:16] sechrist: why should I choose that over javascripts
[05:16] sechrist: easy C implementation?
[05:17] sechrist: because the language doesn't seem awesome
[05:17] gkatsev: prototypal inheritance is even better
[05:17] tbranyen: sechrist: i dunno seems pretty great to me
[05:17] tbranyen: very portable
[05:17] gkatsev: yeah, many game engines use lua
[05:17] tbranyen: i wish node was more portable, but thats a v8 limitation

[05:18] e6nian: /C
[05:18] gkatsev: lua is faster
[05:18] sechrist: nice
[05:18] sechrist: I've seen old game engines that use crc32-based hashing for internal scripting languages and they were fast
[05:18] sechrist: maybe this is why
[05:18] sechrist: lua is popular now
[05:19] sechrist: (like old custom ones designed for the specifications of older consoles and crap)
[05:19] tbranyen: lua isn't faster than v8 by a long shot
[05:19] tbranyen: at least not from my artificial testing
[05:19] tbranyen: luajit is closer, but not quite there
[05:19] gkatsev: I thought it was faster.
[05:20] tbranyen: faster is relative
[05:20] gkatsev: heh
[05:20] sechrist: faster at what
[05:20] tbranyen: maybe it is at some things
[05:20] sechrist: runtime?
[05:20] sechrist: development?
[05:20] jesusabdullah: vroom vroom
[05:20] FredFred has left the channel
[05:20] gkatsev: runtime
[05:20] Aria: faster at math? String manipulation? P
[05:20] Aria: API boundary crossing?
[05:20] sechrist: I want to see a picture of a spidermonkey drinking jaeger in a car with a v8 engine just rolling down the freeway 
[05:20] gkatsev: probably at Math
[05:20] jesusabdullah: What's lua, a straight 4? ;)
[05:20] gkatsev: since it's in a lot of game engines
[05:21] gkatsev: sechrist: haha, that would be awesome
[05:21] jesusabdullah: The reason lua is in game engines is because it's lightweight and embeddable
[05:21] jesusabdullah: and "fast enough"
[05:21] Aria: Heh. Actually, in game engines, it's the /game engine/ that does the math part.
[05:21] gkatsev: sechrist: it should be tracing out the double yellow lines in the middle of the road
[05:21] FredFred has joined the channel
[05:21] tbranyen: according to the PIL book the lua implementation is fastest in the scripting world
[05:21] tbranyen: which i disagree with now
[05:21] jesusabdullah: and similar enough to c-family languages that programmers don't shit bricks when they see it
[05:21] Aria: lua is usually used to direct higher level stuff -- so what math it's doing is minimal, not like C++ or GPU stuff.
[05:21] sechrist: PFFTTT
[05:21] sechrist: UNDER WHAT TESTS
[05:22] sechrist: my lua is faster than my sse3 optimized asm blocks in my c++
[05:22] Aria: But lua /does/ have a very lightweight API. Integration is easy, and there's no huge penalty for jumping in and out of Lua.
[05:22] Aria: There is in v8.
[05:22] kohai: @Jxck_: ついた
[05:22] tbranyen: sechrist: i'm just repeating what the official lua book says
[05:22] tbranyen: :)
[05:22] isaacs has joined the channel
[05:22] Aria: In fact, the V8 API barrier is a royal PITA.
[05:22] sechrist: isaacs: is LUA faster than JS?

[05:22] azeroth____ has joined the channel

[05:24] kohai: @maraksquires: @Jxck_ I'm not sure why, but @NodeKohai likes your Tweet too much. Perhaps you are senpai? #nodejs #nodejs_jp ^_^
[05:24] sechrist: when i'm working with little C progs I want to add some scripting to
[05:24] tbranyen: sechrist: lua offers a lot that isn't available in a majority of javascript implemenations atm
[05:25] tbranyen: like metatables
[05:25] sechrist: ooooh
[05:25] tbranyen: and vice versa
[05:25] tbranyen: javascript has a lot lua doesn't have
[05:25] sechrist: wait wait
[05:25] sechrist: A metatable is the section of a database or other data holding structure that is designated to hold data that will act as source code or metadata.
[05:25] sechrist: code in your kv?
[05:25] sechrist: neat
[05:26] tbranyen: metatables allow you to augment the table structure to hook into different things
[05:26] sechrist: wait I can _kind_ of do that with javascript with function variable references inside of arrays if this is what I'm thinking it is

[06:08] bickie: (want/need)
[06:09] Marak: bickie: i use it in JSONloops
[06:09] Marak: but i dont think anyone else would use it for that same purpose
[06:09] seivan has joined the channel
[06:09] jmoyers: uh
[06:09] Marak: bickie: you prob dont need it for whatever you are doing
[06:10] Aria: bickie: It's good to demonstrate asynchrony without actually tying to IO
[06:10] jmoyers: when you're writing a flow control library ;-)
[06:10] bickie: Aria: gotcha
[06:10] dguttman has joined the channel
[06:10] kohai: @mitchellh: @ericflo So I like Node.js for bringing this "evented everything" mindset to people. But you can do evented in any language.
[06:10] bickie: Aria: does it actually let other operations happen in between?
[06:11] Aria: Sure. Anything that was previously nextTicked.
[06:11] bickie: ie: say you were processing some large array of items that doesn't require any IO to be processed
[06:11] Aria: Also, the big deal is, it clears the stack before executing that function.
[06:11] bickie: aah
[06:11] bickie: so all stacked callbacks are executed?
[06:11] Aria: So it works like async code does.
[06:11] Aria: I believe so. I'd have to re-read the source.
[06:11] bickie: nice
[06:11] bickie: thanks
[06:11] Aria: But yeah. IT goes around the event loop once.
[06:11] Aria: So it's a sort of yield.
[06:12] tbranyen: apparently it serves as a nicer form of setTimeout(function() { }, 0); as well
[06:12] jmoyers: procedural code direcly after gets executed, also
[06:12] Aria: Yeah. It is.
[06:12] jmoyers: setTimeout(fn,0) can be used as a fallback in the browser
[06:13] bickie: Aria: yeah, yield is kinda a nice analogy

[06:15] sreeix has joined the channel
[06:15] jmoyers: if it gets more complicated
[06:15] jmoyers: like 3-4 callbacks depending on each other
[06:16] jmoyers: use a flow control library
[06:16] jmoyers: to keep the code 'flatter'
[06:16] admc has joined the channel
[06:16] gkatsev: or you just name the functions
[06:16] jmoyers: or that
[06:16] gkatsev: then if you want to get fancy, you can use a flow control lib
[06:17] jmoyers: of which there are many
[06:17] jmoyers: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules#async-flow
[06:17] bickie: jmoyers: precisely
[06:17] bickie: yeah
[06:17] bickie: I've been using async.js
[06:17] jmoyers: prefer https://github.com/caolan/async myself
[06:17] jmoyers: i dont always drink flow control koolaid
[06:17] jmoyers: but when i do, its async
[06:18] bickie: jmoyers: yep, that's the one I'm using

[06:18] bickie: where effectively, the result of what step is fed to the next
[06:18] bickie: so optional steps are just skipped by returning the callback instantly

My chat seems to work fine, but nodejs always seems to crash after a few minutes (even with the only 1 or 2 clients connected).

[12:28] justinTNT: too many unknowns, samuel. are you running node in the session? so could node be crashing as a side effect of ssh dying?
[12:29] jonaslund: samuelviking: try running top on the site and look if node eats up all memory or something like that ?
[12:29] jonaslund: "top on the side"

[13:54] samuelviking: lukstr: so what is PAM? have a hard time finding any parsable info on it
[13:54] rbranson: like pluggable authentication modules?

[13:57] rbranson: ah
[13:58] rbranson: what i'm saying is that PAM doesn't really have a use for most people, and if you have a use for it, you probably already know it
[13:58] ScottR4: I'm trying to call fs.readFileSync from within a loaded module, but keep getting EBADF, Bad File Descriptor. I cannot for the life of me figure out why it won't read the file using relative paths, but absolute paths do work.
[13:58] rbranson: like if you need to authenticate against an LDAP directory or Kerberos
[13:59] rbranson: lukstr is right in that if you don't need it, it should be off... that's just good security in general

[15:04] samuelviking: lukstr: well, I know what coda does. it only uploads the file I am editing when I save it. the question is why this is affecting my ssh connection. anyhow, ignoring files would make nodemon's autorestart feature useless. I could just as well ignore changing the files myself
[15:05] lukstr: samuelviking: yes but do you know what happens to that file when it uploads it?
[15:06] samuelviking: lukstr: no, but I guess it is just being uploaded. could anything else be happening and breaking the connection?
[15:07] mertonium has joined the channel
[15:07] lukstr: but just being "uploaded" could do bad things when something is watching the file for changes every second
[15:08] samuelviking: lukstr: wait; the server crashed again with only node running
[15:08] context: lukstr: i think thats the /entire/ point behind nodemon.
[15:08] context: lukstr: i would personally say the issue is coda. stop doing work over ssh. i never understood that
[15:08] context: lukstr: nodemon is doing /exactly/ as it advertised.
[15:09] lukstr: context: I agree, but if coda is doing unpredictable things to the file then nodemon and it are likely fighting

[15:10] samuelviking: context,lukstr: it just crashed again while node was running without nodemon
[15:10] context: lukstr: its not nodemon's fault coda is retarded.

[15:10] lukstr: context: no but nodemon can be configured; I don't think samuelviking has any control over what Coda does, aside from not using it

[15:11] kohai: @crazybob: @Imifos @cbeust Jetty has supported asynchronous processing for at least 7 years. How long has Node.JS been around? ;-)
[15:11] lukstr: context: don't get me wrong this all scares me greatly, I just use vim for everything
[15:11] samuelviking: context: I'd say coda is also doing as advertised: uploading the file. nevertheless, if I can't get node and coda playing nice then I'll just skip editing node files while node is running

[15:12] samuelviking: lukstr: do you use vim for 500-row js files? I'm not that pro!
[15:12] johnnywengluu: prints out view.md on the console
[15:13] samuelviking: lukstr,context: anyways, back on track. this is weird: node is actually still running after my ssh connection dropped

[15:15] lukstr: samuelviking: what problem is there with vim and 500 lines of code?

[15:23] tbranyen: suspended vim just fine

[15:32] samuelviking: lukstr: done

[15:32] iwilkinson has joined the channel
[15:32] fakewaffle: why does textmate not spell check my JS comments? :(
[15:33] samuelviking: lukstr: no, coda has been dead for a while. coda only opens the ssh connection when it transfers a file (after I told it to)
[15:33] lukstr: samuelviking: maybe it tied up some of your OS resources
[15:33] lukstr: hard to say

[15:40] context: lukstr: any server i have access to i need my public key to access anyway.
[15:40] brianc1: I am looking for a template engine for express
[15:40] brianc1: but client does not want jade because client is afraid of significant white space
[15:40] context: ejs ?
[15:40] context: there are plenty of options
[15:40] fakewaffle: brianc1: i just moved from jade to ejs
[15:40] brianc1: any other recommendations? was thinking maybe mustache? what about "dust" anyone have experience w/ that?

[15:40] lukstr: context: I have a few servers I can get around that with, port knocking, tunneling, etc.
[15:41] brianc1: tbranyen: what issue? 
[15:41] tbranyen: brianc1: looping nested objects and getting key/vals
[15:41] context: brianc1: whats express have to do with client side
[15:41] tbranyen: which is basically ever json structure ever
[15:41] tbranyen: every*
[15:41] brianc1: context: I would like to reuse some templates on the client and server
[15:41] tjholowaychuk: the js mustache implementations are pretty bad too
[15:41] rpj8: In express's routing, which one makes more sense to do in node? http://jsfiddle.net/MPgDg/
[15:41] tbranyen: brianc1: conditionals are shitty
[15:42] samuelviking: context,lukstr: I guess we all can agree that remote and local development both have their pros and cons
[15:42] tjholowaychuk: rpj8 depends if it's async or not
[15:42] brianc1: I'll check out ejs. :) thanks y'all
[15:42] tjholowaychuk: which i assume it is
[15:42] rpj8: tjholowaychuk: isn't the goal of node to be asynch?
[15:42] lukstr: samuelviking: of course :) I'm used to writing code where the compiler is, and the compiler is never nearby :)
[15:42] tjholowaychuk: rpj8 yeah, and that doesnt change
[15:42] samuelviking: context,lukstr: in the end though, isn't what matters that we all love and are loved in return?
[15:42] tjholowaychuk: with either of those
[15:43] tjholowaychuk: rpj8 views are not flow control
[15:43] lukstr: samuelviking: no, violence and hate for everyone!
[15:43] tjholowaychuk: they wont wait for your async stuff
[15:43] samuelviking: lukstr: i'm noticing a pattern here - violence, hate, vim vs. love, peace, nano   ;)
[15:43] brianc1: emacs is the zen in the middle
[15:44] rpj8: tjholowaychuk: i'm just wondering mostly which one the cool node programmers would choose ;)
[15:44] lukstr: brianc1: you mean indecisive? ;)
[15:44] tjholowaychuk: rpj8 the only one that works :p haha
[15:44] tjholowaychuk: like i said you can't return a promise
[15:44] context: samuelviking: and then you have emacs
[15:44] tjholowaychuk: and have the view wait for it
[15:44] tjholowaychuk: because it wont
[15:44] context: the bastard child
[15:44] tjholowaychuk: rpj8 though you can special-case it with https://github.com/LearnBoost/express-mongoose
[15:44] tjholowaychuk: stuff like that
[15:44] bene has joined the channel
[15:44] samuelviking: allright, now ssh and node are running again, with coda out of the way
[15:45] tjholowaychuk: but node does not have promises so I wont be supporting that in core

[15:46] e6nian has joined the channel
[15:46] Bradleymeck: and the mustache impls are bad because they try to fully emulate mustache in ruby and use `with` /shudder

[15:46] kohai: @samjoch: DotCloud buy DuoStack #ruby #nodejs #paas
[15:46] e6nian: how to make controll flow sync whn I wanna do `for (i=0;i<=10;i++){ function(i){} )` in node.js ?
[15:46] tjholowaychuk: Bradleymeck haha yeah we added "self" to jade as an option to remove with(){}
[15:46] tjholowaychuk: and it's like 4x as fast
[15:46] tjholowaychuk: something like that
[15:46] dspree has joined the channel
[15:47] tbranyen: so 40ms instead of 160ms?
[15:47] tbranyen: :-p
[15:47] Bradleymeck: emulated with (full featured with short circuiting) is faster in v9 yea
[15:47] Bradleymeck: v8* even
[15:47] tjholowaychuk: probably wouldn't be so bad if with(){} was read-only and didnt let you re-assign shit
[15:47] Bradleymeck: eonian you dont , you could look into node fibres but there are problems with stuff
[15:47] tbranyen: well its the dynamic lookup that kills it?
[15:47] tjholowaychuk: tbranyen not sure i cant remember
[15:48] tbranyen: can't optimize if you don't know where a variable is
[15:48] mike5w3c has joined the channel

[15:49] tbranyen: go*
[15:49] stagas: tjholowaychuk: shit! :)
[15:50] Bradleymeck: its dynamic lookup + eval access + some oddities on what is actually accessible (for when stuff falls through the with statement)

[15:53] rpj8: tjholowaychuk: just curious; is there any planned implementation of promises in express? or is that a limitation just due to how views work as you said

[15:53] tjholowaychuk: in core
[15:54] samuelviking: lukstr,context: status report: nodemon and ssh running, and nano was able to edit a file with nodemon restarting node as it should. nothing crashing at all. 
[15:54] lukstr: samuelviking: yeah so the problem was likely Coda doing terrible things

[15:59] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[15:59] samuelviking: lukstr: yeah. I am still doubting it had to do with coda itself. it's more likely to be any desktop app uploading files via ssh and the way node or nodemon handles that. coda or other editors never broke my ssh connection before i was running node

[16:02] johnnywengluu: what is the equivalent to "npm link ./package" for the latest npm?
[16:02] lukstr: samuelviking: it's likely coda ran into a situation when nodemon tried to touch the file and it broke horribly, so yes likely Coda is at fault (due to provoking nodemon)
[16:02] johnnywengluu: so i don't have to reinstall the package each time i modify it
[16:03] context: lukstr: wait you get paid?
[16:03] context: oh oops

[16:45] AvianFlu: it's all just for you
[16:45] lukstr: it's one thing to get tweets re: commits, bugfixes, general announcements or other stuff, but people being all 'how does i shot web' seems kind of overkill
[16:45] Venom_X has joined the channel
[16:45] context: fakewaffle: to educate people on how to properly use the features of their irc client
[16:46] lukstr: I think it would be a lot more effective if you followed only specific people sans replies
[16:46] fakewaffle: huh?
[16:46] AvianFlu: lukstr: the idea is to see people asking questions, or see people about to give up on node, and help them
[16:46] mscdex: avianflu++
[16:46] v8bot:  mscdex has given a beer to avianflu. avianflu now has 1 beers.
[16:46] lukstr: I don't really idle in here to see people ask questions on twitter though... perhaps it could be done out of band?
[16:47] mscdex: lukstr: then /ignore kohai
[16:47] fakewaffle: better make a facebook bot too
[16:47] lukstr: mscdex: that's what I did
[16:47] AvianFlu: I'll make a facebook bot just to pm you all the time, fakewaffle ;)
[16:47] mscdex: so then why complain?
[16:47] mscdex: :)
[16:47] lukstr: I'm not I'm trying to be constructive

[16:47] bruse has left the channel
[16:47] fakewaffle: i just hate the idea, sorry
[16:47] lukstr: in that you either miss some people or get a lot of nonsense
[16:48] lukstr: if it was just people asking questions that were appropriate, awesome, but it seems nontrivial to filter that out
[16:48] AvianFlu: the nonsense can be filtered, it just needs a more complex algo than kohai has right now
[16:48] AvianFlu: we've got a plan for it
[16:48] AvianFlu: my assumption was that checking for the "retweeted" flag or "RT:" would be enough... silly me
[16:49] lukstr: you need some sort of robot9000 in there

[16:49] lukstr: AvianFlu: besides, as far as I can tell, only people you have whitelisted can actually use it to reply

[16:50] stagas: so we couldn't help someone even if we wanted to
[16:50] lukstr: so I can't really do anything with it if I try, aside from using twitter, which would defeat the purpose?

[16:52] lukstr: I just think interfacing twitter like that to a relatively large channel like this is a difficult task that probably has more cons than pros.

[16:54] AvianFlu: he's twitter muted in here for most of the next hour in the meantime
[16:54] context: i do like how people tend to complain for a very long time when 5 seconds doing /ignore will suffice

[18:02] Cozey: Hello. Could somebody clarify one thing for me: there's a lot of software frameworks for node.js for coding _serverside_, like the module system (require/exports) What about the code which is ment to be run in the browser? Is it possible to test it under node.js and use similar coding techniques ?

[18:06] context: you put it in files only loaded in the browser
[18:07] Cozey: using for instance QUnit for jquery, and have a differend coding pattern for serverside code?

[18:08] lukstr: Cozey: just to clarify node.js is primarily server side. Most node code isn't portable in that you could execute it in a browser. There is generally a divide between the server side js and the client side js. Disclaimer: it is possible, of course, to do all sorts of crazy stuff
[18:09] flippyhead has joined the channel
[18:09] Cozey: ok I understand
[18:09] Cozey: in this way it doesn't help the development of js for the browser, to use node.js instead of, say, RoR?

[18:11] AvianFlu: kohai also can't mute without ops
[18:11] lukstr: Cozey: basically node.js is just javascript executed on a machine, and it's popular to make webservers with it. It doesn't have to be used that way
[18:12] AvianFlu: can't mute people, I mean
[18:12] oh_no: It works on Mac OS X with ópen'of course.

[18:13] CiRlE has joined the channel
[18:14] lukstr: Cozey: do you follow?
[18:14] Cozey: I see - btw. I always considered javascript (perhaps that's not justified) to be inferior to languages designed from ground up to implement server side code, say: python or ruby, maybe java (but perhaps java is too heavyweight). Why is node.js so popular? Is it really faster then ruby or python or anything 'older' ? or is it just fashion?
[18:15] brianc1: was thinking of wiring a "node-alert" module which will block the node process until you press enter on std-in. 
[18:15] oh_no: Anyone know how to get child_process to work on node cygwin?
[18:15] caolanm has joined the channel
[18:15] brianc1: var alert = require('alert');
[18:15] brianc1: alert('oh no! no more requests until you hit enter');
[18:15] igl: because javascript isnt so inferior afterall
[18:15] Cozey: (and please don't consider this a rant - i'd really like to know what are the pros for node.js fans)
[18:15] igl: and after enough years of people having to learn javascript in the browser, people can do it
[18:16] wink_: Cozey: the language is only a part of the picture
[18:16] context: cozey: i would say, partially fashion. but also it closes a gap between developing on the server and client. one language everywhere.  and i think people are starting to realize async code is the way to go, and that node does it really well
[18:16] brianc1: Cozey: also node.js going with javascript over ruby or python allowed the ecosystem to start somewhat 'fresh' (not a large amount of pre-existing, blocking server side javascript) and so all modules were designed from the get-go to be async
[18:16] context: err well... async as appose to threads, is good in a lot of situations
[18:17] Cozey: I find it always a pain to code js - the debugging is quite miserable, searching for libraries scattered all over the internet, I always were able to produce good code with python or java.  otoh - so many people loving node.js environment can't be wrong
[18:17] isaacs: brianc1: maybe you could also do a document.write module? ;P
[18:17] wink_: Cozey: what environment are you debugging js in that it's a pain?
[18:17] wink_: firebug really changed that game years ago
[18:17] brianc1: isaacs: excellent idea.

[18:18] brianc1: lol
[18:18] Cozey: chrome failing sometimes in strange ways
[18:18] lukstr: Cozey: node.js is very young. And coding in JS in node is not like coding JS in the browser, however there are similarities, the environment is different because you are not in a browser.
[18:18] Cozey: so in what way is it 'closing the gap' ?
[18:18] wink_: chrome failing isn't the fault of the language though :|

[18:40] indutny: podman: one connection
[18:40] mnbvasd: podman: as a general rule it's quicker to have persisten connections.
[18:40] podman: lol, conflicting opinions
[18:40] mnbvasd: (I don't know specifically for that module tho).
[18:40] indutny: podman: it's really one connection

[18:49] gmonnerat has joined the channel
[18:50] kcbanner: podman: are you sure its mongo that is hanging?
[18:50] podman: i can duplicate it by manually dropping the connection to mongodb, so i think that's the problem
[18:50] perezd: so, someone enlighten me: Is solaris preferred with socket-based applications?/
[18:50] kcbanner: ah
[18:50] perezd: trying to figure out why people have an affinity for that platform
[18:50] aheckmann has joined the channel
[18:50] context: perezd: i think most of not all applications these days have sockets.
[18:51] lukstr: perezd: some people like using solaris for servers
[18:51] hij1nx_ has joined the channel
[18:51] gmonnerat has left the channel
[18:51] context: perezd: and considering oracle took solaris and bastardizing it, the remote idea of thinking of using it is unbelievable
[18:51] nibblebot has joined the channel
[18:51] dshaw_ has joined the channel
[18:51] prophit has joined the channel
[18:51] perezd: lukstr: what i mean is, how do you go about picking that over the other things, is it optimized for a particular type of situation?
[18:51] podman: kcbanner: that doesn't mean that it really is mongodb that's causing it, it's just my best guess at this point
[18:51] perezd: I haven't much messed with it, but curious that companies like joyent use it heavily
[18:51] varioust has joined the channel
[18:51] podman: so, to mitigate that, i was thinking that if i just opened a new connection for every request, that wouldn't be a problem anymore
[18:51] context: perezd: every os has its pros/cons. if you dont know solaris and never touched it. dont start now.
[18:51] kcbanner: podman: ok, I only ask because its easy to miss a logic path in express and not send anything back, which will cause the page to load forever
[18:52] podman: but i figured i'd ask if that was the best practice
[18:52] podman: kcbanner: no, the logic is pretty simple
[18:52] kcbanner: ok
[18:52] kcbanner: podman: in my express apps, I use mongoose and I haven't had this problem, but I also host my own mongod
[18:52] perezd: context: I think thats pretty short sighted, I think it must serve some sort of need.
[18:52] kcbanner: and I set up the connection once when the app starts
[18:52] podman: kcbanner: i'll be getting to that eventually
[18:52] context: perezd: and its possible joyent is running a lot of sun hardware. which id prolly run solaris on as well. or maybe they heavily depend on ZFS.
[18:52] context: perezd: there isnt any one particular reason to use solaris
[18:52] perezd: context: good point
[18:53] podman: setting up a replica set on AWS doesn't sound like fun to me
[18:53] lukstr: which are my thoughts exactly. Whenever I've used solaris it's been on sun hardware
[18:53] perezd: context: I was curious if its something liek "yeah, it has a really solid socket implementation in its kernel" or something
[18:53] lukstr: they should rename it to Oraclis
[18:53] kcbanner: podman: https://github.com/kcbanner/nodelog/blob/master/app.js this is how I do my setup
[18:53] context: perezd: this is 2011. every os has a 'solid' socket impl.
[18:53] avalanche123 has joined the channel
[18:54] podman: kcbanner: lol, nice stash
[18:54] perezd: context: I don't want to make that assumption without knowing that to be true.
[18:54] kohai: @naholyr: @piouPiouM je serais bien tenté de proposer un atelier #nodejs, mais moi c'est la logistique qui va coincer @ParisWeb
[18:54] kcbanner: podman: ...sadly its not real
[18:54] podman: i could tell
[18:54] context: perezd: if any given os didn't have a solid socket impl. it wouldn't be used... period. 
[18:55] kcbanner: perezd: yep sockets are fairly critical. You can tune linux as well for better socket perf
[18:55] context: NO ONE would use it. except the hobbyist writing it
[18:55] podman: kcbanner: so, i would guess that mongoose does it's own connection management and will reconnect if there is an issue

[18:57] nibblebot has joined the channel
[18:57] perezd: context: I am trying to measure them, and diagnose them properly
[18:57] perezd: lots of variables
[18:57] context: so instead of fixing them you are asking about replacing you entire infrastructure
[18:57] podman: kcbanner: i don't really have any problems with mongodb-native... unless they haven't fixed this connection issue
[18:57] perezd: context: I was asking for perspective, not a lexture
[18:57] perezd: lecture*
[18:58] kcbanner: perezd: boil it down to simple test cases and tune to improve
[18:58] lukstr: perezd: they are likely unrelated to which OS you are using, and solaris is unlikely going to solve anything.
[18:58] perezd: I agree, I was mostly trying to understand what the rationale is behind it, eg: is it inherently better at dealing with a type of application
[18:58] broofa has joined the channel
[18:58] kcbanner: perezd: I'm more curious what tipped you off that Solaris might be better

[18:59] lukstr: people use openbsd too
[18:59] perezd: so I figured I'd learn about it some from any experience people may have in the room

[19:47] Aikar: orospakr: my solution to that is to rm -rf /usr/local/lib/node_modules then ln -s /usr/local/lib/node/ /usr/local/lib/node_modules
[19:47] Aikar: then reinstall your modules and they will work globally again
[19:47] orospakr: Aikar, heh, thanks.
[19:47] orospakr: npm has this constant so-near-yet-so-far thing going on.
[19:48] Aikar: i dont advocate using global modules in code, but stuff like vows is meant to be global
[19:48] Aikar: and sucks that require('vows/bin/vows') doesnt work with latest ver of npm :/

[19:55] jerrysv: level09: huh? websockets are part of html5
[19:55] Aikar: websockets is turned on for Chrome
[19:55] jerrysv: level09: and if you use socket.io there are fallbacks
[19:55] level09: like what?
[19:55] Aikar: just some mozilla exec is a moron and its disabled in firefox when it shouldnt be

[19:56] Aikar: socket.io is reliable
[19:56] Aikar: it has fallback
[19:56] jerrysv: level09: socket.io encapsulates websockets, ajax, comet, flash, etc for complete reliability

[20:08] `3rdEden: http://caniuse.com/#search=websockets
[20:08] `3rdEden: :0
[20:08] level09: FF4 is not yet that popular 
[20:08] level09: is there any alternative to web sockets ?
[20:09] konobi: level09: use socket.io
[20:09] konobi: it provides fallback mechanisms
[20:09] podman: `3rdEden: have you looked at http://documentcloud.github.com/docsplit/
[20:09] level09: konobi: let me get it clear, socket.io is not related to websockets ? 
[20:10] konobi: it is
[20:10] level09: but it has fallback mechanisms?
[20:10] level09: so it would work on most browsers ? 
[20:10] konobi: but it will fallback to other longpolling methods if websockets are not available
[20:10] level09: nice
[20:10] konobi: (several levels of fallbacks too)
[20:11] level09: I'll take a look , thanks very much
[20:11] `3rdEden: why don't you just read http://socket.io

[21:18] jmoyers: well he's right in that many platforms use a similar concept
[21:18] raynos: I can't tell whether node.js has any place for being used in situations where .NET / J2EE stacks are used
[21:18] jmoyers: we have thread pools and such and blah blah blah
[21:19] jerrysv: java was fun back in the early days, before it became so burly filled with more needing to know all of the api documentation rather than needing to know the language
[21:19] niftylettuce: tjholowaychuk: I pushed github instructions to readme.md for stylus
[21:19] SubStack: where j2ee stacks are used there are other more systemic problems
[21:19] easternbloc has joined the channel
[21:19] tjholowaychuk: niftylettuce you're not using npm?
[21:19] jonaslund: jerrysv: i disagree.. the only benefit today for java is that you can accomplish very much by just writing shims to existing libs for this and that
[21:19] raynos: I've actually never used j2ee so I dont know whether its good/bad
[21:20] jmoyers: its just a heavy container
[21:20] SubStack: one of the biggest draws for me about node is reductionism
[21:20] jonaslund: jerrysv: OTOH if you want to do a lot of stuff you're in for pain
[21:20] jmoyers: that is supposed to do things such as handle clustering for you
[21:20] jmoyers: and he mentioned ORMs and such
[21:20] SubStack: take away all the stupid bullshit and just delete it, don't even make it possible
[21:20] jmoyers: java guys are used to hibernate et al
[21:20] niftylettuce: tjholowaychuk: no I am, but latest version from npm didn't have 0.0.8 yet so I did it with git, and plus all my projects have different node_modules, so its easier to maintain multiple servers using a node_modules folder vs npm at times
[21:20] SubStack: like promises, throw that shit in user space
[21:20] jonaslund: SubStack: personally i love the Erlang model of shared immutable data
[21:20] jerrysv: jonaslund: so much domain specific knowledge though
[21:20] niftylettuce: tjholowaychuk: you can deny pull request, i just threw it in there since I had just done it earlier today
[21:20] jmoyers: node.js doesn't have hibernate and garbage of its ilk because most of us view that kind of stuff as technical debt
[21:21] jonaslund: ACTION holds his thumbs for JS to receive immutable structures
[21:21] SubStack: that java example of a tcp server on that page has all of these inside-out interfaces that you have to know about to write stuff tersely
[21:21] raynos: jmoyers: I agree on that.
[21:21] SubStack: but in node that is the only way to do it
[21:21] raynos: KISS. Write micro frameworks
[21:21] jmoyers: he mentions "seem to specify a standardised way of writing components" -- by which in the EE world, he's thinking of various BEANS of various types and such
[21:21] raynos: Dont over engineer.
[21:22] SubStack: jonaslund: you might like dnode, which I wrote
[21:22] raynos: jmoyers: isnt that what require is for ;) require allows you to require a component
[21:22] SubStack: although I've never used erlang
[21:22] jmoyers: well not exactly
[21:22] jmoyers: in java ee there are different classes of component that have scaling behaviors and such
[21:22] jonaslund: SubStack: my point for immutable datatypes is to allow for efficient use of in-process concurrency

[21:27] tjholowaychuk: thanks man
[21:28] niftylettuce: i'm coming from sass/compass :)
[21:28] niftylettuce: the days of "compass watch" are over
[21:28] niftylettuce: and compass compile -e production
[21:28] niftylettuce: yuckK
[21:28] tjholowaychuk: haha
[21:28] tjholowaychuk: is that how they use it?
[21:28] duncanbeevers: Those days are ending for the Rails folks too.
[21:29] tjholowaychuk: sass has been around for 5 years it should be nicer to use than that
[21:30] jmoyers: people talk about compass all the time
[21:30] jmoyers: one of the main reasons i was hesitant to go with stylus
[21:30] jmoyers: i dove in head first though, never looked back ;-)
[21:30] tjholowaychuk: compass docs are great
[21:30] softdrink: people use Windows all the time… ;)
[21:30] jonaslund: SubStack: well yeah.. you can do that but right now you're still bound to a single in-process JS thread.. even if web-workers was implemented as in-memory you'd still need serialization so shared state would not really help much.
[21:31] JianMeng has joined the channel
[21:31] jmoyers: tjholowaychuk: yeah, they seem to take a designer slant also, so people who are just focused on markup can grok it easily
[21:31] jmoyers: as silly as it is
[21:32] tjholowaychuk: maybe yeah
[21:32] jmoyers: the website is damn fine looking
[21:32] tjholowaychuk: it's pretty verbose but easy for designers i guess
[21:32] jmoyers: well it may or may not actually be easier for designers
[21:32] jmoyers: but their marketing is solid
[21:32] tjholowaychuk: for sure
[21:32] tjholowaychuk: like i said though, stylus is reallllly new
[21:32] jmoyers: yerp
[21:33] tjholowaychuk: ~2 months vs 5 years
[21:33] hellp has joined the channel
[21:34] niftylettuce: tjholowaychuk: so we don't need to build a library for docs, we can just use .md's and such
[21:34] tjholowaychuk: haha yeah
[21:34] tjholowaychuk: nib has like no docs at all
[21:34] niftylettuce: tjholowaychuk: i'm sure I can help
[21:34] tjholowaychuk: so it's kinda hurtin but whatever it will happen some day
[21:34] niftylettuce: tjholowaychuk: maybe even get some stylus screenr's up myself to help get support
[21:34] jmoyers: life is hard when you have 60 modules ;-)
[21:35] SubStack: jonaslund: yes you get a single JS thread but you can use the thread pool in c++ land, which is probably for the best
[21:35] niftylettuce: jmoyers++
[21:35] v8bot:  niftylettuce has given a beer to jmoyers. jmoyers now has 1 beers.
[21:35] niftylettuce: I haz no more b33rz
[21:35] SubStack: because then whenever you write in JS you don't have to care about threaded execution
[21:35] SubStack: which naturally lends itself to a module-driven design

[21:35] jonaslund: you wouldn't really care much more with immutable data passing

[21:36] tjholowaychuk: lame name
[21:36] niftylettuce: jonzin.js

[22:04] a|i: why is that big sites, like facebook, never use _push_ for realtime messaging? why is that they prefer _pulling_ instead? in the case of facebook, they use long polling.
[22:04] shimondoodkin has joined the channel
[22:04] ptlo has joined the channel
[22:05] a|i: any efficiency difference when using websocket push vs long polling with node+socket.io?
[22:06] jerrysv: ali: yes. flashsockets have a slow startup
[22:07] a|i: jerrysv: on the server side, or the client side?
[22:07] jerrysv: ali: not sure, never tried to track down which
[22:08] a|i: is node's efficiency comarable to erlang, when it comes to handling many long-polling users?
[22:08] m00p has joined the channel
[22:08] tauren: a|i: perhaps facebook implemented realtime messaging when long polling was the best and most compatible solution at the time? 
[22:09] a|i: tauren: isn't it, still?
[22:09] duncanbeevers: Long-polling works in more hardened environments. Corporate firewalls are likely to have permissive http policies.
[22:09] eksmith has joined the channel
[22:10] a|i: duncanbeevers: correct, I guess long-polling has the best coverage of all.
[22:10] tauren: i suppose so, but its not what i'd use for my sites
[22:10] jerrysv: tauren: socket.io, let the best of breed figure itself out
[22:10] duncanbeevers: There's no reason you can't support more than one protocol.
[22:10] tauren: but then i don't have the reach of facebook!
[22:11] duncanbeevers: Limiting yourself just limits your potential customer base.
[22:11] a|i: it seems the only downside of long-polling is, using a lot of resources on the server side due to keeping a connection open for ever, but erlang does not care about that.
[22:11] tauren: right, of course. i'm using socket.io. I'm just saying that something like it didn't exist when FB created their solution.
[22:11] jerrysv: duncanbeevers: bummer about the bourbonic, btw -- i saw your tweet right after i saw the bailey's tweet about it being replaced
[22:11] jonaslund: a|i: neither does node
[22:11] a|i: duncanbeevers: but long-polling supesedes all other methods?

[22:18] tauren: jerrysv: you?

[22:18] context: nibblebot: skinny controller fat model
[22:19] context: nibblebot: controller is to read the request and return a response. model is where most/all business logic goes
[22:19] nibblebot: there are no examples i've seen that talk about extending the models
[22:19] jerrysv: tauren: yeah, managed to buy a ticket right out of the gate with jsconf bundle, and my SO managed to get one when nodeconf tix went available. we got to hit both confs together

[22:34] captain_morgan: hever: jsdom
[22:35] jerrysv: captain_morgan: that was a straight up c lib?
[22:35] jerrysv: captain_morgan: i fixed my problem by compiling the lib from source and linking straight against it
[22:35] captain_morgan: cpp, extern "C" for the node parts
[22:35] jerrysv: captain_morgan: may not have been the most elegant solution, but it "worked"
[22:36] hever: It sucks a bit that you can't read somewhere what a mod is doing or am I just not getting it?
[22:38] captain_morgan: jerrysv: So somethinkg like bld.stlib(source..., target..., name...)
[22:39] jerrysv: captain_morgan: my c++ is rusty at best, i only made it through the linking stage on mine by adding the c src into the wscript and fixing a bunch of cast errors

[23:27] creationix: PouchDB? does that mean it's pocketable?
[23:27] mjr_: That's gonna be great.
[23:28] tilgovi: creationix: yes
[23:28] mikeal: PouchDB is a portable CouchDB in javascript that can replicate with CouchDB
[23:28] creationix: leveldb bindings are fun
[23:28] tilgovi: pocketable indeed.
[23:28] sechrist: oh my
[23:28] tilgovi: creationix: I might take a stab at the WriteBatch right now.
[23:28] creationix: tilgovi: go for it, I was about to, but I've been busy
[23:28] creationix: should be pretty easy
[23:28] tilgovi: yep.
[23:29] mjr_: couchdb replication / changes is such a great feature.

[23:30] mscdex: hah

[23:30] creationix: mjr_: it shouldn't be hard to implement the redis api on top of leveldb either
[23:30] sechrist: burn
[23:31] niftylettuce: anyone here use browserify?
[23:31] creationix: just not sure the use case

[23:36] mjr_: creationix: are you guys exploring putting node+leveldb in your distro?
[23:37] creationix: mjr_: not officially, but it's something I want to explore
[23:37] mjr_: because that sounds like a great solution for different devices
[23:37] creationix: mjr_: right, if not for internal use, it would be great for third-party devs
[23:37] mjr_: I'm so over sqlite
[23:37] rchavik has joined the channel
[23:37] creationix: I'd prefer sqlite over what I have now
[23:37] mjr_: Seems like a great solution for mobile devices, but it's slow slow slow
[23:37] jonashuckestein has joined the channel
[23:37] SubStack: niftylettuce: you can have an array of entries I'm pretty sure but to have multiple mounts you can just have multiple calls to browserify
[23:37] creationix: mobile is slow slow slow
[23:38] mjr_: sure, then combine that with sqlite for ultimate slowness
[23:38] creationix: lol
[23:38] creationix: I haven't built my module on webos yet, but I know node is much slower on mobile
[23:38] mjr_: of course
[23:38] kkaefer: sqlite is pretty fast far what it is
[23:38] SubStack: niftylettuce: so pretty much what you've got there in that paste looks fine
[23:39] mjr_: it's not so slow that I don't use it. 
[23:39] alek_br_ has joined the channel
[23:39] creationix: mjr_: what level of queries do you usually do?
[23:39] kkaefer: it's essentially a free form file format that you can query with sql
[23:39] mjr_: But it's pretty damn slow
[23:39] creationix: leveldb doesn't have any query engine, but one can be build on top of it
[23:40] mjr_: If you can batch up your sqlite queries, you can avoid a lot of the per-transaction overhead and it's pretty fast.
[23:40] mjr_: But if your access pattern or your programming language doesn't easily support this, the granular access to sqlite is brutally slow
[23:41] creationix: ahh yeah, I don't think there are any locks in leveldb
[23:41] creationix: just mvcc through the nature of the db
[23:41] kkaefer: mjr_: read access is actually relatively fast, write access is pretty slow though
[23:41] mjr_: kkaefer: yes, for sure
[23:41] kkaefer: you can do PRAGMA journal_mode=wal;
[23:41] kkaefer: and set sync to 0
[23:41] mjr_: if you can batch writes, sqlite blazes
[23:41] kkaefer: and batch inserts into transactions
[23:42] hever: I need to replace a \r, any idea how I can do this?
[23:42] creationix: hever: in a string?
[23:42] hever: yes
[23:42] creationix: mystring.replace("\r", newvalue)
[23:42] creationix: will replace the first \r in the string and return a new string
[23:43] hever: creationix, I'm retrieving html and parsing it... ok but it seems it doesn't ;)
[23:43] creationix: do you need the first one, or all of them?
[23:43] creationix: that's different
[23:43] hever: ooh
[23:43] mjr_: kkaefer: not sure if we've tried that yet on iOS.
[23:43] creationix: mystring.replace(/\r/g, newvalue)
[23:43] kkaefer: stock iOS doesn't support WAL
[23:43] kkaefer: it's new in 3.7
[23:43] mjr_: ahh, that's why
[23:43] kkaefer: you have to statically compile sqlite if you want that
[23:44] hever: it was my fault I thought argument 1 is a regexp as you used it in your second example
[23:44] hever: creationix, thanks !
[23:44] creationix: :)
[23:44] marcoseliziario has joined the channel
[23:45] mikey_p: kkaefer: i'm seriously impressed with the work that's being done with sqlite
[23:45] hever: creationix, uhm no and sorry again. It's still not working...
[23:45] mjr_: kkaefer: thanks for the tip, I'll check that out.  That might actually help us a lot.
[23:45] mikey_p: i love that the mbtiles format is just a wrapper on sqlite
[23:45] creationix: "Hello\rWorld".replace("\r", "\n")
[23:45] kkaefer: mjr_: it's not a lot faster though, not sure whether it's a lot faster
[23:45] hever: not with "\r" nor /\r/ or /\\r/
[23:46] kkaefer: mjr_: it's faster if you have multiple database handles writing to the same databases
[23:46] jpick has joined the channel
[23:46] kkaefer: as it handles logging more gracefully
[23:46] creationix: js: "Hello\rWorld".replace("\r", "\n")
[23:46] gbot2: creationix: "Hello\nWorld"
[23:46] kkaefer: s/logging/locking/
[23:46] mjr_: kkaefer: that's exactly our scenario
[23:46] kkaefer: ah, heh
[23:46] kkaefer: mikey_p: thanks!
[23:46] creationix: js: "lulululu".replace(/u/g, "a")
[23:46] gbot2: creationix: "lalalala"
[23:47] justinTNT has joined the channel
[23:47] mikey_p: kkaefer: i think the whole mapping stack is one of the most interesting projects in node
[23:47] creationix: hever: I'd experiment in the node repl or web-inspector console
[23:47] creationix: faster feedback that way
[23:47] shanez has joined the channel
[23:47] kkaefer: mikey_p: we also have https://github.com/developmentseed/bones
[23:48] hever: creationix, ok now I got it. It must be something like   t.write(ent.encode(response).replace(/[\r\n]/g, ''));
[23:48] mikey_p: kkaefer: yeah, i've been following that closely
[23:48] hever: I replaced the response before I encoded it ;)
[23:48] hever: that won't work ;)
[23:48] mikey_p: kkaefer: right now, I'm toying with trying to handle some small scale tile serving for one of our clients
[23:49] creationix: mjr_: so do you do a lot of joins or other relational things, or will simple key/value or couch-style map-reduce be enough?
[23:49] mjr_: no joins, just a couple of simple indicies
[23:49] mikey_p: ACTION just found http://support.mapbox.com/kb/tilestream/using-tilestream-with-drupal, this is awesome!
[23:50] creationix: maybe indexdb will make it into ios some day
