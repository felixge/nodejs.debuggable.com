[01:57] AvianFlu: rook2pawn: use the 0.4.x branch unless you're trying to test windows support
[01:57] Aria: A library tied to an interpreter entry point.
[01:58] Aria: And considering it's a sort of standard library that way, it almost makes it its own language.
[01:58] chilts: quotemstr: Nods.JS is an implementation of the JavaScript programming language
[01:59] Aria: Not really. It uses v8 for that.

[02:01] e6nian has joined the channel
[02:01] Aria: It's a little unique in how it's structured, since Javascript has such a nonexistant standard library.
[02:02] Aria: And nonexistent external interface spec.
[02:02] Aria: But node's just a library, and by so being, is a huge portion of the system you see as a programmer.
[02:03] jmoyers: er..
[02:03] chilts: I think to quotemstr that's exactly what he's after, it's the programming language
[02:03] jmoyers: its really a collection of bindings
[02:03] chilts: who's bothered about v8 being the heavy lifting
[02:03] jimmyrcom has joined the channel
[02:04] jmoyers: its not a programming language
[02:04] jmoyers: javascript is the programming language
[02:04] chilts: that's what I said earlier, it's an implementation of JavaScript
[02:04] jmoyers: its bindings to a collection of libraries for common low level tasks: filesystem, networking, etc
[02:04] jmoyers: its not!
[02:04] chilts: heh
[02:04] jmoyers: v8 is a javascript engine
[02:05] kriszyp has joined the channel
[02:05] Aria: Hehe. "language", from a linguistics perspective, makes node a language. It may have a very similar syntax to regular javascript, but it's got its own rules and idioms.
[02:06] Lorentz: Dialect?
[02:06] jmoyers: sooo not a language
[02:06] quotemstr: Aria: That's like saying Shakespeare is a language.
[02:06] jmoyers: i'll agree, it does have its idioms and whatnot
[02:07] jmoyers: callbacks, asynch io
[02:07] Kuntau: >.<
[02:07] quotemstr: Aria: If you follow your approach to its conclusion, then every program has its own language. That's what we do: model the world by creating domain-specific words to refer to it, and expressing ideas in these new terms.
[02:07] quotemstr: Not every new abstraction is a new language.
[02:07] Aria: True that, but it's a systemic change. 
[02:08] Aria: And not mutually intelligible, or lack of a better concept.
[02:08] quotemstr: I just wanted to know whether, as conventionally used for writing web applications, people have a Node.js program serve HTTP, or whether they rely on another HTTP server and just use Node.js for dynamic content generation.
[02:08] towski has joined the channel
[02:08] jmoyers: no
[02:08] jmoyers: node = http server

[02:09] Aria: Lots of people proxy. It's good enough to not for lots of people.
[02:09] quotemstr: Aria: If you guys can't distinguish between a new language and a new work (however groundbreaking) in a new language, I'm going to have serious reservations about the rest of your system.
[02:09] quotemstr: jmoyers: Thanks.

[02:39] EM03: interesting freaking statement SubStack 
[02:39] Lorentz: Believing in bad practices.

[02:52] random123: Do YOU (yes you) restart node.js while debugging or is there a way you can do it without restarting it after each change?
[02:53] Aria: I restart each time. Hot reloading is sometimes possible, if you hack with the require cache, but isn't always side-effect free. 
[02:55] random123: I would think its fundamental to development to make debugging easier if you didn't have to restart the process 100,000 times to make something
[02:55] random123: Am I alone in thinking that is very important?
[02:56] random123: If I developed node that would be high up on my priorities, like a requirement

[05:08] Lorentz: Not to say your question is often asked, davidbanham
[05:09] Prometheus: Lorentz: sure why not =)
[05:09] davidbanham: Lorentz: No, it'd be a great idea. You'd get some of the permanence of a bulletin board while retaining the immediacy and informality of IRC.
[05:10] zodiak: rurufufuss: siege
[05:11] davidbanham: The way I'd like to see it work would be that, at the end of a good exchange in IRC, you would issue a command to a bot with a series of usernames and a timeframe. The bot would then slurp all of the posts made by those users in that timeframe and post them to a wiki somewhere. It would need to be a wiki so it could be cleaned up as needed.
[05:12] rurufufuss: thanks zodiak

[05:19] davidbanham: zodiak: Fair enough. It was a little optimistic to hope that security would be taken care of for me by the internet gnomes.
[05:19] zodiak: davidbanham: well, SSL is as secure as anything the mysql peeps would write anyway, so, use that and you are golden

[08:56] Talon_: lol dragnl0rd, I'm a die hard perl fan, I'm so used to it, trying to do things in php just irritate me so I gave up, even simple little things like inline arrays aren't in php. I just felt it wasn't worth the transition so I gave up.

[08:57] Murvin: Guest17007: which npm version u have?
[08:57] deoxxa: (array() is a language construct, not a function)
[08:57] Guest17007: 1.0.15
[08:58] Talon_: so, you can do array(1,2,3)[0] then ?

[08:58] Murvin: what OS?
[08:58] Guest17007: debian
[08:58] Murvin: hmmm
[08:58] Guest17007: but also as simple user (in another VM)
[08:58] deoxxa: also you could do array_shift(array(1,2,3)), but that's silly
[08:59] Murvin: after you install, you should see the package in node_module  folder.  did you see the package?
[08:59] Murvin: by the way, did you use -g flag?  if you use that, it only runs in command line.
[08:59] Murvin: so don't use it.

[09:07] Guest17007: yes ?
[09:07] dragnl0rd: in a wierd way, yes.
[09:07] Guest17007: like zombie, jsdom
[09:07] Guest17007: ok I will try also
[09:08] dragnl0rd: I've set up projects pulling down socket.io, express, and mustache
[09:08] jetienne: Guest17007: jsdom is quite slow

[10:41] dall: ChristW, ?
[10:41] dall: what? i don't understand
[10:42] dall: i'm usin http.Request...
[10:42] ChristW: dall: What part don't you understand?
[10:42] dall: i have to send some values and get the response
[10:42] ChristW: dall: You do 'xxx = http.Request(...)', correct?
[10:42] bnoordhuis has joined the channel
[10:43] dall: right
[10:43] ChristW: Then, you do 'xxx.write("key1=value1&key2=value2");' to get the values to the server.
[10:44] dall: could i do
[10:44] dall: xxx.end()
[10:44] dall: ?
[10:44] dall: or
[10:44] dall: write() close automatically ?
[10:44] ChristW: No, you'll need xxx.end() after the write.
[10:44] ChristW: There may be more values to write to the server.
[10:45] dall: ChristW, ok but if i write "key1=value1&key2=value"
[10:45] [AD]Turbo has joined the channel
[10:45] dall: the php page could get the values like $_POST['key1']
[10:45] dall: right?

[10:46] ChristW: Yes, that doesn't change.

[10:47] Kingdutch: O.o
[10:48] dall: and i saw req.write(data)
[10:48] Kingdutch: That's just ... *shudder*

[10:49] dall: but for POST request
[10:49] Kingdutch: Ooh right
[10:49] Kingdutch: Yeah
[10:49] Kingdutch: Just change the metohd
[10:49] Kingdutch: That's all that changes
[10:49] Kingdutch: GET /index.html would become POST /index.html if you're doing the raw requests
[10:49] dall: i have to pass some info to the server
[10:49] dall: Kingdutch, this is a simple request
[10:50] dall: i have to send data to the server
[10:50] dall: it's a php page that have to get the value i set using $_POST['key1'] ecc ecc
[10:51] Kingdutch: Yeh right
[10:51] Kingdutch: So just change the method

[13:53] postwait has joined the channel
[13:53] tuhoojabotti: AgainstAllOdds: What is the problem?
[13:53] AgainstAllOdds: but that's not the right event since the socket go in idle but the client is still connected

[13:53] kkaefer: slow disk
[13:53] kkaefer: or the inserts you're doing are very expensive
[13:54] jetienne: kkaefer: hmm not that slow... but ok i will do hdparam 
[13:54] kkaefer: or the connection to the database has a low bandwidth
[13:54] AgainstAllOdds: the problem is: If a client network connectivity is not available

[15:10] JKarsrud: not exactly an mvc framework, but express can be used to do and mvc architecture :
[15:11] chjj: express is better than a traditional mvc framework because it doesnt make stupid assumptions
[15:11] JKarsrud: exactly =)
[15:11] JKarsrud: but it doesn't have to be mvc either

[15:26] dexter_e: But having a Rails-esque mess of hundreds of little controllers can be a pain too.
[15:27] Hinton: dexter_e: But you could just group things like, user that holds register, login
[15:27] JKarsrud: well, depends on the app, but if you have 100 controllers, it's a mess either way
[15:27] dexter_e: Have you guys considered a multi-view code editor?
[15:27] Hinton: multi-view?
[15:27] futuredarrell has joined the channel
[15:28] dexter_e: Open the same file like 8 times and scroll to different parts of it in different windows.

[18:49] postwait: V8 frees it.
[18:49] postwait: right after return.

[18:52] postwait: Valgrind dies on line 27
[18:52] postwait: I broke that line into 4 lines... args declare and 3 assignments into 0,1,2
[18:52] postwait: It dies on the buffer->handle_
[18:53] postwait: I have to call it in a tight loop millions of times to get it trigger. but it does. realiably.
[18:53] postwait: I fixed the issues by hoisting the Buffer::New code out into my caller (which is a PITA because getting SlowBuffer constructor is a lot of work from there)
[18:53] ryah: this blog post is not very good
[18:53] postwait: "fixed" -- I avoided the issue.
[18:54] ryah: after line 13 he should do "return scope.Close(buffer->handle_)"
[18:54] postwait: that's slow buffer though.. he wants a fastbuffer.
[18:55] postwait: I've been hacking on fixing the node-compress module. (I need it for something)
[18:55] AntelopeSalad_ has joined the channel
[18:55] postwait: So, I need my C++ to fabricate and return a "buffer" (not a slowbuffer)
[18:56] postwait: And that code "works".. but if a GC run happens between lines 8 and the return of 31, *boom*
[18:56] postwait: That's because of the return of the Unwrap.
[18:56] postwait: by hoisting the Local<Value> of the wrapped buffer into my caller -- it doesn't leave context until I'm done with it
[18:56] ryah: postwait: do you have a HandleScope at the top of yoru function?
[18:56] postwait: and isn't eligible for gc.
[18:57] postwait: yes.
[18:57] postwait: But there's a HandleScope at the top of the Buffer::New function in node_buffer.cc -- which is the problem, I suppose.
[18:57] ryah: i don't see how it can be GCed...
[18:57] ryah: hm
[18:58] ryah: oh - maybe that's possible
[18:58] postwait: I bet removing that would solve it (for good)
[18:58] ryah: postwait: buffer->Ref() will prevent it from being GCed
[18:58] unvamp has joined the channel
[18:59] postwait: If I can call it fast enough... But, it's a protected function, so I can't call that form my caller.
[18:59] robhawkes has joined the channel
[18:59] avalanche123 has joined the channel
[18:59] postwait: I think the HandleScope's at the top of the Buffer::New's returning Buffer * should be removed.
[18:59] ryah: postwait: yeah - well if we're actually getting the weak reference callback here in one step - that's really bad
[19:00] postwait: You see any issues with that? so the Local<Value> is in callers context.
[19:00] postwait: s/context/scope/
[19:00] ryah: postwait: sounds scary
[19:00] postwait: as for it being bad -- just means the GC's rockin' it hard ;p)
[19:01] ryah: hm
[19:01] cccaldas has joined the channel
[19:01] ianward has joined the channel
[19:02] postwait: Why does having the new buffer in caller's scope (for purpose of GC) sound scary?
[19:02] ryah: so the only reference is the Persistent handle.... it GCs at the close of Buffer::New's HandleScope
[19:02] ryah: V8 detects that the only ref is the Persistent handle - therefore calls the WeakRef callback
[19:02] ryah: which then frees the buffer
[19:02] ryah: that's horrible!
[19:02] postwait: "can" free the buffer.
[19:02] softdrink: does connect() return the same thing as connect.createServer()?
[19:03] postwait: doesn't happen all the time, but race conditions should be eliminated ;-)
[19:03] jrabbit: I canb't compile c-ares on my platform
[19:03] tjholowaychuk: softdrink yup
[19:03] ryah: postwait: yeah - i guess class Buffer should derive from v8::Value
[19:03] ryah: and return a Local<Buffer>
[19:03] fille: dammit dident know that it was so hard to find a suggestion algoritm
[19:03] postwait: scope.Close(.... of the new one)
[19:04] ryah: okay - well - sorry about this
[19:04] ryah: this is good to know
[19:04] postwait: So.. my workaround is to use the internals.
[19:04] postwait: but I'm trying to cache my reference to the slowbuffer constructor function.
[19:04] postwait: Hence my question about how to take a Local<Function> and make it persist so I can reuse it in subsequence calls.

[20:27] Tobbe: I was looking for some tutorials on node.js and found this: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/learning-serverside-javascript-with-node-js/ But it seems to use a lot of old things that doesn't exist in newer APIs. So I tried to update it to run on 0.4.9.
[20:27] Tobbe: This is what I've got: http://paste2.org/p/1514057 This is the warning I get: http://paste2.org/p/1514062 Why do I get that warning? Should I worry about it?

[20:33] doctorm: I'm trying to share a PHP session with node.js, and I have a cookie set to the wildcard ".domain.com". However, on foo.domain.com, I'm only getting cookies associated with foo.domain.com. I know cookies are sent through headers, so this isn't a node specific question, but has anyone dealt with this before or can see something obvious I'm overlooking?
[20:34] bradleymeck: doctorm are you sure the cookie is being sent by the browser?

[20:56] TheJH: context: why does socket.io suck?
[20:56] context: from what i see you cant do io.connect() on the server side

[20:56] mandric has joined the channel
[20:56] context: just listen.

[20:57] context: ahh kk
[20:57] DetroitOwnz: TheJH: As in, can be used as a DoS vector.

[21:25] TheJH: postwait: you can start node with something like "--expose-debug-as=debug" (don't remember the exact name), and the the garbage collection will happen much faster as a side effect. it also allows cou to trace back from where something gets referenced
[21:25] TheJH: *allows you

[22:26] taf2: added another script to generate a cipher.key
[22:27] taf2: and also encrypt the same file for verification
[22:27] taf2: then i modified my crypt.js code to fs.readFileSync('cipher.key').toString('binary'),  i md5sum( the binary string to verify the keys match ) 
[22:27] context: uhh
[22:28] context: you picked the key in node, then expect a random key to properly decrypt it?
[22:28] taf2: no, i picked the key in ruby, then read the key in node
[22:28] taf2: i encrypt the file in ruby as a verification... because in node as the crypt.js file shows the decrypted version is not matching the original file
[22:28] context: no. in node your cipher key is '1233322819'
[22:28] taf2: here i'll update that...
[22:29] taf2: context, refresh sorry i fixed the too short key issu
[22:29] taf2: now i'm reading that key from the generated key file in ruby
[22:29] taf2: and offline ran md5sum on the cipher.key file to compare the in memory version and the checksums matched

[23:01] Intel_iX: can someone give me any clues as to why "fs.writeFileSync '~/test.txt', JSON.stringify ls", throws "Error: EBADF, Bad file descriptor '~/test.txt'"
[23:05] jerrysv: intel_ix: no glob, so ~ isn't expanding
[23:05] jerrysv: would be my guess
[23:05] Murvin: is there any known issue of node or express on ubuntu vm?
[23:07] Intel_iX: No what?
[23:08] jerrysv: glob: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming) - file expansion. ~ is an alias to your home directory that usually gets expanded with globbing
[23:09] Intel_iX: I'm on mint os, that should work...
[23:09] jerrysv: intel_ix: try "/home/intel_ix/test.txt" instead
[23:10] Intel_iX: That works but
[23:10] Intel_iX: it's not exactly going to do what I need that way
[23:10] Intel_iX: Since every user would need to set a name
[23:11] jerrysv: the problem is that globbing tends to happen at the language level, not at the os level
[23:11] jerrysv: or at the shell level

[23:11] jerrysv: intel_ix: if you need glob functionality, isaacs wrote a module: https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob

[23:14] Intel_iX: I have no idea but
[23:14] Intel_iX: that's kinda sucky...
[23:15] jerrysv: then use glob, and it should do tilde expansion:  GLOB_TILDE Expand tilde names from the passwd file.

[23:33] tanepiper: Murvin: check that headers aren't being sent in the body - i know I had recent issues with that on some macs browsing our site actually, caused the cookie to be re-written on each page load.  I've actually yet to solve it, but only because i haven't had time :)
[23:33] tanepiper: hey jerrysv 
[23:33] Murvin: like,  when I do authentication and set the user:  req.session.user = "murvin".   It works in Ubuntu 10.04.   but in Ubuntu 10.10, it is not set.  i.e. in the next request, req.session.user is empty
[23:33] tanepiper: it was actually jerrysv that noticed the issue :)
[23:33] jerrysv: heh
[23:34] jerrysv: i did make it work, eventually
[23:34] ekryski: Not yet. no.  When would you like to chat again
[23:34] techwraith: isaacs: I'm trying to set up an npm registry for yammer, I've installed the app, now I'm trying to replicate the registry and I'm getting this error: {"error":"json_encode","reason":"{bad_term,<0.3780.0>}"} - any ideas?
[23:34] tanepiper: oh so you did :)  It was adding an image to yout linked in - hmm yea, i need to look at that

[23:38] Murvin: tanepiper: however, for macs browsers calling node.js serving running on Ubuntu 10.10. (32 bit).  it doesn't work.  req.session is not set.  redirect doesn't work.
