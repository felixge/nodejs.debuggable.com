[00:59] marcello3d: extending, sure
[00:59] marcello3d: adopting? depends on the api, right?
[00:59] marcello3d: if it walks and talks like a javascript module, I don't see why I wouldn't use it
[01:00] jmoyers: well it looks like for instance, zombie.js compiles everything and npm install gives you a fully usable index
[01:00] systemfault: Some people hate dependancies
[01:00] jmoyers: so that seems fine and good and fine
[01:00] marcello3d: I suppose if it's buggy, I'll be less adventurous on fixing it unless it was awesome
[01:00] isaacs: marcello3d: yes, dropbox: not for code.
[01:00] isaacs: marcello3d: it screws symlinks
[01:00] marcello3d: I usually don't have symlinks in my code
[01:01] isaacs: marcello3d: well... you do if you use npm :)
[01:01] marcello3d: true
[01:01] isaacs: marcello3d: dropbox also has a nasty habit of screwing with .git index files.
[01:01] marcello3d: hmmm
[01:01] isaacs: you probably do usually have those in your code
[01:01] marcello3d: what do you suggest, then?
[01:02] gtramont1na: hey all, I'm giving Nib a try, but I can't get it working. I can see in the Javascript API that inside the 'compile' function, there is this line '.use'(nib());' Do I always have to have a compile function in order to use Nib? I was using stylus directly, without the compile function.
[01:02] isaacs: marcello3d: dont' use dropbox for that :)
[01:02] techwraith: marcello3d: git :)
[01:02] isaacs: marcello3d: yeah, use git to move code around.
[01:02] marcello3d: it's more for backup than moving code around
[01:02] tjholowaychuk: gtramont1na: you can use stylus directly
[01:02] isaacs: marcello3d: i backup with timemachine
[01:02] isaacs: it's pretty awesome.
[01:02] marcello3d: ah
[01:02] tjholowaychuk: the compile function is needed so that you can use the stylus api for settings / adding plugins etc
[01:02] isaacs: i do use dropbox for docs, mind you.
[01:03] isaacs: and i <3 it for that
[01:03] marcello3d: I use that, too
[01:03] marcello3d: but timemachine gives me lots of grief
[01:03] tjholowaychuk: gtramont1na: the object passed for settings would be far to large in some cases so we have .set() .use() etc
[01:03] marcello3d: dropbox Just Works (except for symlinks ;D)
[01:03] isaacs: and i keep secret things in an encfs mount, where the encrypted data is what dropbox syncs
[01:03] febits[0] has joined the channel
[01:03] marcello3d: isaacs: yup
[01:03] gtramont1na: tjholowaychuk: I see. But whenever I write @import 'nib' the compiler gives me an error becouse it couldn't find nib.
[01:04] marcello3d: isaacs: is encfs cross platform?
[01:04] tjholowaychuk: gtramont1na: can you show me a gist if your code?
[01:04] tjholowaychuk: just your stylus config stuff
[01:04] marcello3d: I just use encrypted dmgs
[01:04] isaacs: marcello3d: i dunno, it's just some open source thing
[01:04] gtramont1na: tjholowaychuk: I might have screwed up my npm. brb
[01:04] isaacs: marcello3d: it's a fuse program
[01:04] isaacs: marcello3d: crashplan is like the offsite-equivalent of time machine.  not quite as slick, but about as magical.

[01:09] pizthewiz has joined the channel
[01:09] tjholowaychuk: because stylus doesn't know where to look

[01:48] tjholowaychuk: several routes could potentially handle the same request

[01:50] ChrisPartridge: req.url ?
[01:50] tjholowaychuk: not other than req.url nope
[01:50] tonymilne: What about something like:
[01:50] tonymilne: var matches = app.router.match(url);
[01:50] tjholowaychuk: express doesn't currently set anything like that
[01:50] tjholowaychuk: we certainly could set req.currentRoute or something
[01:51] tonymilne: which would check all registered routes, and return any matching the regex of the routes you've defined.
[01:51] ravinggenius: surely something eventually matches a url to a function
[01:51] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[01:51] tjholowaychuk: im just saying it's not exposed
[01:51] tonymilne: if you try what i did, you get access to the route obects, which have functions on them as callback.
[01:51] tjholowaychuk: tonymilne mentioned you can use app.match.all(url)
[01:51] tjholowaychuk: or app.match.get(url) etc
[01:52] tjholowaychuk: app.router.match is private though
[01:52] tonymilne: TJ, out of interest, do you hate that idea?
[01:52] tjholowaychuk: btw :p
[01:52] tjholowaychuk: nope I dont
[01:52] tonymilne: coz, im using it with socket.io too wrap express.
[01:52] tjholowaychuk: not sure it's overly useful ATM since all you would know is the route path and the callback I guess but it would be simple to add
[01:52] tonymilne: so using socket.io i can get a payload with a url that will call my express actions and return the response as json via socketio.

[01:54] tjholowaychuk: part of me hates special-casing routes as anything other than regular middleware
[01:54] tjholowaychuk: but it's handy sometimes
[01:54] tjholowaychuk: right
[01:54] tjholowaychuk: yeah app.match(url) i guess
[01:54] tjholowaychuk: would be the way to go
[01:55] tjholowaychuk: app.match() == app.match.all()

[02:13] tjholowaychuk: --drupal
[02:13] mikey_p: mrjeeves: http://pushmachine.com/
[02:13] mikey_p: the idea of socket.io wrapped with a REST service could work for lots of systems though
[02:14] mikey_p: the service is not drupal specific, although that's what it was designed for
[02:14] ravinggenius: tjholowaychuk, i use something similar to what i was asking for in my rails app. i set the id (forums_index) and some classes (forums index) to the body element that correspond to the current controller/action pair
[02:14] mikey_p: ACTION couldn't agree with tj more
[02:15] tjholowaychuk: ravinggenius: right
[02:15] tjholowaychuk: gotcha
[02:15] nexxy: but bolting node to drupal is like putting 20" spinners on a station wagon on its last leg
[02:15] ravinggenius: very useful
[02:15] tjholowaychuk: why not just get the pathname.split('/')
[02:15] tjholowaychuk: that's what I would do

[02:17] ravinggenius: tjholowaychuk, not sure i got that...
[02:17] tjholowaychuk: ravinggenius: well that's the way it has to be really, because the resource routing is just a fancy way to construct regular express routes
[02:17] tjholowaychuk: so if you change the pathname
[02:17] tjholowaychuk: then the url's pathname needs to change

[02:17] tim_smart: *are
[02:17] ravinggenius: okay
[02:17] nexxy: mikey_p, I can!
[02:17] tjholowaychuk: ravinggenius: but I get what you are going for, I used to do that too
[02:18] mikey_p: nexxy: you have meeting space?
[02:18] nexxy: yus
[02:18] tjholowaychuk: ravinggenius: I could certainly expose routing details so that for instance you could have a dynamic helper called bodyClasses
[02:18] tjholowaychuk: that maps to req.currentRoute.pathname.split('/') (or something)
[02:18] hink has joined the channel
[02:18] nexxy: mikey_p, with seating and a giant fish tank and a kitchen and a TV
[02:19] nexxy: slash monitor
[02:19] ravinggenius: tjholowaychuk, that would probably be enough
[02:19] mikey_p: nexxy: how soon can we start?
[02:19] tjholowaychuk: ravinggenius: not 100% ideal, since like you mentioned if you change the route then your styling needs to change
[02:19] tjholowaychuk: but hey
[02:19] tjholowaychuk: that's the price of non-rails
[02:19] tjholowaychuk: haha
[02:19] nexxy: mikey_p, as soon as we get enough people interested! ;3 and we figure out a schedule
[02:19] tjholowaychuk: but feel free to open an issue and ill get to it

[02:21] CiRlE has joined the channel
[02:22] nexxy: mikey_p, I can also get us space 
[02:22] ravinggenius: tjholowaychuk, +1 for bodyClasses. thank for the help
[02:22] nexxy: @ a bar/stripclub... but only if everyone interested is 21+
[02:22] nexxy: ;D
[02:23] nexxy: but maybe that'd be too much of a distraction... there is a lovely deck area though
[02:23] mikey_p: why don't we just pick a day/time for backspace and get it on calagator
[02:24] bartt has joined the channel

[02:25] hij1nx has joined the channel
[02:25] mikey_p: nexxy: sure
[02:27] tjholowaychuk: kkaefer: I had a node one started but didnt get around to finishing it
[02:27] tjholowaychuk: CI joe is nice and simple
[02:27] tjholowaychuk: just based on the exit status of a command
[02:27] tjholowaychuk: n thats about it
[02:28] kkaefer: hm, I remember isaacs mentioning something about automated builds for the npm registry
[02:29] tjholowaychuk: yeah that might be nice eventually to centralize things
[02:29] tjholowaychuk: though I dont think it matters much if it's the normalized test output or not
[02:29] tjholowaychuk: just store stderr and call it a day
[02:30] mikey_p: probably wouldn't be too hard to press hudson/jenkins into service

[02:31] tjholowaychuk: or just write something quick
[02:31] tjholowaychuk: shouldnt take to long
[02:31] tjholowaychuk: now that node is stable-ish
[02:31] tjholowaychuk: i started it wayyy back
[02:32] kkaefer: yeah
[02:32] deedubs: tjholowaychuk: sec for a cluster q?
[02:32] tjholowaychuk: yeah sure
[02:32] deedubs: in the docs it says to include your app via filename to ensure you don't have lose connections laying around
[02:33] tjholowaychuk: yup
[02:33] deedubs: maybe I'm just a node newb but how does one get the cluster object to the workers
[02:33] tjholowaychuk: master executes the same file N times
[02:33] tjholowaychuk: so if you have say var db = redis.createClient() in there
[02:33] tjholowaychuk: master will have a connection as well as all the workers
[02:33] deedubs: yeah okay maybe I wasn't clear
[02:33] tjholowaychuk: so by suggesting the filename it will only load that file when in the workers
[02:33] tjholowaychuk: preventing funky stuff like that
[02:34] mrjeeves: mikey_p: thx for the reads. i'll need to investigate this further
[02:34] deedubs: I understand why and we're cool with that
[02:34] deedubs: but for example cluster-log
[02:34] tjholowaychuk: oh
[02:34] tjholowaychuk: just a local socket
[02:34] deedubs: I need to call master.log('login',user.name') for example
[02:34] tjholowaychuk: just json over the local sock

[02:39] tjholowaychuk: ravinggenius: cool cool
[02:40] brownies: yea, i was going to use hashlib. i'll assume it's good since it's at the top of the list
[02:40] tjholowaychuk: i probably wont add the bodyClasses helper by default

[03:49] aconbere has joined the channel
[03:49] rznt: the node folder

[03:51] rznt: ok i've executed make distclean
[03:51] rznt: so reconf and rebuild?

[04:11] Ratty_: ChrisPartridge: Ah cool. I'll take a look
[04:11] mikegerwitz: rznt: from your shell, type `node`. It should open a prompt. Then paste that in.
[04:12] rznt: > require( 'crypto' ).createHash( 'sha1' ).update( 'foo' ).digest( 'hex' ); TypeError: undefined is not a function
[04:13] mikegerwitz: rznt: alright, you have a problem then. I'm not sure why. I'd paste your ./configure output on a site like gist.github.com, pastebin, etc so someone can take a look. I have to head off to bed very shortly.
[04:13] rznt: ok
[04:13] rznt: you're going to bed now? or do u have time for a quick peek
[04:13] mikegerwitz: rznt: Few minutes. I can look quickly
[04:13] darshanshankar has joined the channel
[04:14] rznt: nvm, its not enough time, i forgot to save the output so i'd have to reconfigure

[04:17] rznt: at https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation

[04:18] alek_br_ has joined the channel

[04:20] rznt: ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local/node
[04:21] mikegerwitz: rznt: Try: ~/local/node/bin/node
[04:21] mikegerwitz: rznt: and see if it outputs binary
[04:21] mikegerwitz: hex*
[04:21] rznt: er hold on
[04:21] rznt: but i don't have to rebuild correct?
[04:21] mikegerwitz: rznt: nope don't rebuild
[04:21] rznt: ~/local/node/bin/node for the prefix of ./configure?
[04:22] mikegerwitz: neither, sorry. Run that as a command.
[04:22] mikegerwitz: rznt: It'll execute node in that dir

[04:23] rznt: yes
[04:23] mikegerwitz: rznt: export PATH="$HOME/local/node/bin:$PATH" will solve your problem. I'd recommend removing node from /usr/local/bin
[04:24] rznt: i can run export path indirectly?
[04:24] ChrisPartridge: put it in ~/.bashrc
[04:24] mikegerwitz: rznt: You'll also need to add that export line to your ~/.bashrc file. Alternatively, run ./configure without --prefix, rebuild and reinstall.

[04:39] aconbere: and then I get a little stumped
[04:39] tonymilne: Are you using a test framework? 
[04:39] tonymilne: I think Jasmin does this with it's spies.
[04:39] aconbere: ah
[04:40] rznt: yep i think it works!
[04:40] rznt: thanks for everything!
[04:40] mikegerwitz: rznt: np
[04:40] aconbere: so I've used vows, minitest and nodeunit
[04:40] aconbere: but for this project I'm using nodeunit

[04:48] tonymilne: you using curl?

[04:48] Ma0c: i get a permissions denied error
[04:48] gavin_huang has joined the channel
[04:48] tonymilne: used sudo in front?
[04:48] Ma0c: yep
[04:48] Ma0c: sh: line 8: npm-install-15891.sh: Permission denied
[04:48] Ma0c: sh: npm-install-15891.sh: No such file or directory
[04:48] Ma0c: rm: npm-install-15891.sh: No such file or directory
[04:49] mikegerwitz: Ma0c: sudo applies to curl but not sh. Try doing 'sudo su' then running the command
[04:50] Ma0c: su: unknown login
[04:50] Ma0c: ?
[04:50] mikegerwitz: Ma0c:  I suppose I should have asked what OS
[04:51] Ma0c: mac osx leapord
[04:51] mikegerwitz: Ma0c: I don't know how to gain root privileges in OSX. But however it's done, try doing that.
[04:51] tonymilne: maybe sudo bash?
[04:51] tonymilne: does what you're saying?
[04:51] mikegerwitz: can try that
[04:52] tbranyen: su root
[04:52] jhurliman: you don't need sudo to switch users. just type su
[04:52] tbranyen: sudo -s
[04:52] Aria: curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh
[04:52] tonymilne: lol, yes Aria's probs better. ;)
[04:52] mikegerwitz: agreed, heh
[04:52] Aria: Though also it's recommended to go brew-style and chown /usr/local to be owned by you.
[04:52] Ma0c: ok
[04:52] arlolra has joined the channel
[04:52] Ma0c: hmmm
[04:53] Ma0c: what would be the password for su?
[04:53] Aria: Your root password.
[04:53] Aria: If you've not set one, it won't work.
[04:53] Ma0c: yeah havnt set one
[04:53] Aria: sudo, however, uses your own password
[04:53] Aria: More the macos style.
[04:54] Ma0c: i have also tried using git to setup npm
[04:54] mikegerwitz: Ma0c: try what Aria said. Otherwise, see if 'sudo passwd' works to set the root password. But generally, if you have sudo on your system, it's best to avoid logging in as root directly.

[05:16] jhurliman: another way of doing deep copying (hacky or elegant depending on who you ask) is to serialize the object as a string and then JSON.parse() it each time you need a copy of the object

[05:35] nerdfunk: or perhaps not web stuff :P
[05:35] zeunix: good evening gents. curious, best method of passing an http req to a child or parent process? If I just pass it via stdout it gets passed as a buffer, which I can then convert to a string, then eval but obviously I'm sure there's a much cleaner method. Figured I'd ask around first.
[05:35] ryah_: req.pipe(child.stdin)
[05:35] ChrisPartridge: nerdfunk: Yeah, mainly JSON (XML for some clients)
[05:35] ryah_: ^-- this is fast
[05:35] Ma0c: neoesque: k, im installing node through macports now, might take a while with all the other packages. ill be back here if it doesnt work lol

[05:54] ryah_: zeunix: :)
[05:54] zeunix: ryah_:  I'm trying to let the child process pass the request object to the parent. e.g. the parent would be able to go req.url, etc for that request.
[05:54] ryah_: oh
[05:54] ryah_: well - you can do that but only as a JSON object...
[05:54] ryah_: you have to serialize it somehow
[05:55] zeunix: ryah_: I tried JSON.stringify but it kept shitting itself
[05:55] ryah_: process.stdout(JSON.stringify(req) + '\n')
[05:55] ryah_: process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify(req) + '\n')
[05:55] zeunix: ryah_: that was my original attempt. then I guess you could eval it to get it back :/
[05:56] ryah_: sure - but without the methods
[05:56] zeunix: ryah_: right.  Which brings me to wonder, there isn't a secret voodoo way of passing memory references between processes for node?
[05:56] ryah_: no
[05:57] ryah_: we're adamant about not attempting it too
[05:57] ryah_: sadness lies down that road
[05:57] ryah_: but i suppose i could make it easier for people to do this...
[05:57] rmustacc: rayh_: You don't want an mmap binding...
[05:58] rmustacc: Or at least, going down that path seems dangerous.
[05:58] ryah_: var n = require('child_process').spawnNode(__dirname + '/sub.js');
[05:58] zeunix: ryah_: I figured so considering. Completely understandable. Guess I'm just looking for the best solution for the problem.
[05:58] ryah_: n.on('message')
[05:59] ryah_: n.send({ hello: "world" })
[05:59] ryah_: this would be easy to do
[05:59] ryah_: probably people would like it
[05:59] rmustacc: Mmm, but in that case you're spawning another process, no?
[05:59] ryah_: yeah
[05:59] rmustacc: Oh good.
[06:00] ryah_: i mean, it would also serialize JSON and have "slow" message passing
[06:00] ryah_: (quotes because it certainly is not gong to be anyone bottleneck)
[06:00] ryah_: (if only because they should know that's a potential bottlenek
[06:00] rmustacc: Yeah, that all makes sense. I was just avoiding the original sharing memory references.
[06:00] ryah_: yeah
[06:00] ryah_: mmap sadness

[06:11] ryah_: yeah, i think for this spawnNode i'll just open an extra pipe
[06:11] ryah_: pass a flag to the child node process to tell it to expect the pipe
[06:12] ryah_: wrap it in a net.Socket, and add some nice js api
[06:12] ryah_: i've got a little json stream parser i'll include too
[06:12] rmustacc: So the child's stdin/stdout will just be whatever the parent's is?

[06:23] tonymilne: jetienne: Is that so you can easily include modules?
[06:23] pquerna: nodeons, cute.
[06:24] jetienne: tonymilne: more like im using require() in eval() so require'path is confused
[06:24] tonymilne: var path = require('path');
[06:24] tonymilne: var targetDir = path.join(__dirname, 'this/that');
[06:24] tonymilne: require.paths.unshift(targetDir);
[06:24] pquerna: jetienne: you can path.join things to be absolute paths... but not sure what you want
[06:24] tonymilne: something like that may help.
[06:24] tonymilne: unshifting it onto your paths means it will be the first spot module requiring should look.
[06:25] jetienne: tonymilne: this will work with require('./slota') ? not sure
[06:25] micro`_ has joined the channel
[06:25] tonymilne: well, you'd just need to say require('slota') because it doesnt need to be relative to the current directory any more.
[06:25] tonymilne: (which is what the ./ is saying)
[06:25] jetienne: pquerna: yep dirty... thinking maybe to override require() at the begining of the eval to do the relative path to abs path conversion
[06:26] aaronblohowiak: [ANN] Haml 0.4.0 with optional "make `=` escape by default", escaped interpolation and optional custom html_escape function
[06:26] jetienne: tonymilne: well i need it to be relative :) the .js isnt in node_modules
[06:26] jetienne: tonymilne: pquerna: ok thanks, i will use the require() override technic
[06:27] kixxauth has joined the channel
[06:28] tonymilne: I must be missing something, but you can just put a directory, lib for example, on your requires path, and then do stuff like:
[06:28] tonymilne: require('a/path/to/module');
[06:29] tonymilne: which is really:
[06:29] maru_cc has joined the channel
[06:29] tonymilne: app/lib/a/path/to/module
[06:29] jetienne: require('a/path') isnt relative in require world... or am i wrong. let me chekc
[06:30] tonymilne: no, modules require works be checking a series of things, 
[06:30] tonymilne: e.g. index.js, index.node, etc.
[06:30] tonymilne: for each of the require paths, in order.

[06:31] jetienne: tonymilne: found it :)
[06:32] tonymilne: Cool, does that makes sense what im thinking?
[06:32] jetienne: tonymilne: not sure what you are thinking :)
[06:32] tonymilne: lol :)
[06:32] jetienne: tonymilne: require resolve is power full but complex :) there are the relative path, the node_modules, NODE_PATH require.path :)

[07:09] NuckingFuts: We're gonna do PHP for now, but I'll probably do NodeJS once I'm free from my client dev obligations :P
[07:09] NuckingFuts: quackslike: For powering the site
[07:09] Charuru: oh are you serious
[07:09] Charuru: ahaha
[07:09] NuckingFuts: It's gonna be an open API, so people can extend the site freely
[07:09] coreb: I was kidding, I dislike php
[07:09] quackslike: can you be more specific?
[07:09] NuckingFuts: PHP can work for now, we just need a quick development cycle

[07:12] hwinkel has joined the channel
[07:12] Aria: When you do what, chendrix ?
[07:13] mrjeeves: not to but in, but i've done an api like the one you speak of
[07:13] chendrix: when I request a url that's not the base url
[07:13] chendrix: "/"
[07:13] chendrix: I can't seem to come up with a regex that would allow me to detect all except for files
[07:13] quackslike: mrjeeves: for which site?
[07:13] mrjeeves: http://skateropolis.com
[07:14] mrjeeves: the iphone app even allows you to send pics straight from the phone to the site, stores it in your folder using tokens, and attaches it to the skatepark/group/user you uploaded it to
[07:14] ShizWeaK has joined the channel
[07:14] mrjeeves: every single feature of the site is available in the app
[07:14] quackslike: mrjeeves: nice one
[07:15] mrjeeves: all done with services api
[07:15] chendrix: I'm using express, and whenever I request something that's 404ed, it just tells me Cannot GET /foo
[07:15] chendrix: and doesn't throw any sort of error that's detectable
[07:15] jhurliman: chendrix, setup a catch-all handler as the last handler in the line
[07:16] jhurliman: app.get('/*', errorHandler.handle404);
[07:16] chendrix: that gives me 404s for every single file I request, though
[07:16] chjj: chendrix: put it as your last route
[07:16] quackslike: chendrix: the express examples are quite good.. have a look at those in the repo
[07:18] ryah_: ACTION is half-way through digging the tunnel for the channel fd

[07:20] NuckingFuts: quackslike: Doubtful.  They seem to be too busy building random shit.
[07:20] chendrix: not particularly. They show throwing an error and rendering a 404 page when someone requests '/404'
[07:20] chendrix: but not when someone requests everything except for a file

[07:24] Aria: sys has been old for a while. use util instead.
[07:24] matyr_ has joined the channel
[07:24] chjj: Ned_: yeah, sys is deprecated, some of the stuff that was in there got moved to "util"
[07:24] quackslike: chendrix: this works for me as last route: app.all('/*', function(req, res, next){
[07:24] quackslike:   	res.render('error.html');
[07:25] quackslike: });
[07:25] Ned_: chjj: yeah, and console by the looks :-)

[07:25] Ned_: ;-)
[07:26] stonebranch has joined the channel
[07:26] chjj: uh, i know 0.4 and newer definitely uses util
[07:26] Ned_: really ?
[07:26] Ned_: oh, wait
[07:26] Ned_: ye
[07:26] Ned_: yes
[07:26] Ned_: that's quite recent though right ?
[07:26] chjj: yeah, somewhat
[07:26] Ned_: my minimum is 0.2.0 atm
[07:26] chjj: wow thats ancient
[07:27] chendrix: quackslike That works, for when I only request '/something', but now, on my homepage, where I have multiple requests for files, it doesn't load those
[07:27] quackslike: chjj: ancient lol
[07:27] chjj: im not sure the actual version sys was deprecated and util was added
[07:27] Ned_: chjj: righto, 
[07:27] Ned_: well perhaps I should just say 0.4.0
[07:27] Ned_: and play it safe
[07:27] Ned_: :p
[07:28] Ned_: chjj: crap, wait
[07:28] quackslike: chendrix: hmm ok.
[07:28] Ned_: that's my module version number

[07:47] chendrix: quackslike: AHA! Found it in the google group http://groups.google.com/group/express-js/msg/33c68ad3cbe5a534, default express installation places app.use(app.router) before the static(), which means that it tries to route to /* and gets a 404 before even being given to static(). Just switching their place works!
[07:47] mscdex: DoNaLd`: fs.createReadStream('foo.pdf') gives you a stream that emits Buffers

[08:50] xsyn: err, there are a couple of things I need to look at
[08:50] xsyn: latest = express@2.3.4 not supported by node@v0.2.6
[08:50] xsyn: and apparently I'm installing outside of my PATH
[08:50] Emmanuel__: maybe you should upgrade node :)
[08:50] xsyn: *goes to hunt*
[08:50] nexxy: xsyn, are you using the latest npm?
[08:50] xsyn: :)
[08:50] Emmanuel__: nexxy: that's what I thought too, but for some reason with the latest npm, it is advice to sudo npm install stuff
[08:51] nexxy: oh you should use sudo
[08:51] xsyn: nexxy: I'm using the node packaged with brew
[08:51] Emmanuel__: for some reason I didn't fully understand
[08:51] nexxy: just not -g
[08:51] Emmanuel__: ah, sry
[08:51] nexxy: Emmanuel__, I didn't either at first until I asked isaacs
[08:51] xsyn: 0.2.11-5
[08:51] nexxy: using sudo with npm will allow it to sandbox your installs
[08:51] Emmanuel__: well, with previous version, it always tried to install in /usr/local
[08:51] nexxy: running it as you gives it the same privs you have
[08:51] eldios has joined the channel
[08:52] Emmanuel__: with the newer, if you don't sudo, it will install the module somewhere in your $home
[08:52] nexxy: Emmanuel__, ya, now the default is `cwd`/node_modules
[08:52] Emmanuel__: -> that sucks
[08:52] viz has joined the channel
[08:52] nexxy: no
[08:52] nexxy: it's a good thing
[08:52] Emmanuel__: well, at least, it was very confusing for me :)
[08:52] nexxy: it is at first, but it makes your apps less brittle
[08:52] nexxy: e.g. app 1 depends on version x of module W
[08:53] nexxy: app 2 comes along later, and wants version y of module W
[08:53] nexxy: you update, thus breaking app 1
[08:53] nexxy: whereas with each app with its own module repo
[08:53] nexxy: no problem!
[08:53] nexxy: but things like node-inspector... definitely install globally
[08:53] mc_greeny has joined the channel
[08:54] xsyn: k, well, I'm going to start by upgrading node :)
[08:54] nexxy: and npm!

[08:55] nexxy: sathia, yeah that never really wears off
[08:55] nexxy: ;3
[08:55] Emmanuel__: agree :)
[08:56] sathia: i was looking for a way to let the users of a mobile site to chat together and google suggested to go nodejs
[08:56] chjj: google is smart
[08:56] nexxy: sathia, yay ;3
[08:56] sathia: i looked at the examples but I'm a bit confused
[08:57] chjj: hes a real standup guy
[08:57] nexxy: sathia, I imagine you'll want to get a hold of socket.io
[08:57] Doosje has joined the channel
[08:57] sathia: definitely
[08:57] nexxy: and probably express ;3
[08:57] sathia: is there anyone who'd like to take as job the development of a chat?
[08:57] nexxy: I'm sure there would be several
[08:58] nexxy: what kind of chat do you have in mind?
[08:58] nexxy: text/audio/video?
[08:58] sathia: basically I'd like to authenticate my users to the mobile chat
[08:58] sathia: and let them create rooms/private chat
[08:59] sathia: put an avatar on it
[08:59] nexxy: something like chats.io (written in node) ?
[08:59] chjj: hmm, so not your typical "example chat" app
[08:59] chjj: ;p
[08:59] sathia: let me say, "google talk" chat style

[09:01] nexxy: sounds quite attainable
[09:01] chjj: so, you want this chat to have persistent users?
[09:01] eldios: my eyes just popped out the orbits ---> http://layerstyles.org/builder.html

[09:03] eldios: you smarty!
[09:05] chjj: sathia, that would be pretty easy to get up and running if you held the users in memory for the time being
[09:06] sathia: i made some tests with ab (apache benchmark) yesterday and it held 5k concurrent users flawlessly on my development box
[09:06] chjj: dont know if mysql is the right choice for users, because something like user data only really needs something like a simple key-value store mechanism
[09:07] nexxy: mongo/riak
[09:07] sathia: it's only about the login process and avatar path retrieving
[09:07] matyr has joined the channel
[09:08] chjj: yeah, using mysql is like using a sledge hammer to peel an orange then

[12:04] sorens3n: whats the goal of the wrapper?
[12:04] jtrudeau has joined the channel
[12:05] chris6F: to provide a simpler interface to the Redis data types
[12:05] jbpros has joined the channel
[12:05] chris6F: instead of HMGET, HLEN, HSET, etc.
[12:05] chris6F: you call `redback.createHash(key)`
[12:05] chris6F: hash = redback.createHash('user1');
[12:05] sorens3n: =\
[12:05] chris6F: hash.set({username: 'chris', password: 'foo', callback)
[12:06] chris6F: way easier to use
[12:06] chris6F: also there's higher level structures like a SocialGraph (think twitter following vs. followers), KeyPairs, DensitySets
[12:06] sorens3n: if i relate it back to what i do with SQL, its a cross breed between using raw SQL queries and an ORM
[12:06] stagas: chris6F: cool stuff
[12:06] malkomalko has joined the channel
[12:06] chris6F: sort of
[12:06] sorens3n: at least thats what it seems like so far
[12:07] chris6F: you can do things with the Redis types (Set,Hash,List,SortedSet) that are difficult with SQL
[12:07] Omersd: Hello
[12:07] sorens3n: yeah i hate to even throw SQL into the mix
[12:07] MattJ has joined the channel
[12:07] sorens3n: only to relate the inbetween if anything else
[12:07] chris6F: for example, if you have a set of users - each who follow one or more users
[12:07] tiagoa has joined the channel
[12:08] chris6F: in SQL it's difficult to find things such as "find the set of followers that one or more users have in common"
[12:08] chris6F: like with Twitter how they say "you and this person each follow these people"
[12:08] sorens3n: yeah i wouldnt throw SQL in this mix other than the point i just made
[12:08] chris6F: in Redis/Redback it's easy and super fast
[12:08] chris6F: yeah
[12:08] sorens3n: which is just to myself 
[12:08] sorens3n: https://github.com/Shakakai/redis-orm
[12:09] sorens3n: nothing there it seems, but thats kinda what i would hope to see in an expanded redis API
[12:09] chris6F: interesting
[12:09] chris6F: it's easy to add structures
[12:09] sorens3n: kinda abstract thinking
[12:09] chris6F: i'll probably add an ORM eventually
[12:09] sorens3n: im a mongodb fan myself
[12:10] sorens3n: i would love to have a redis ORM, even if to just define schemas from within node
[12:10] chris6F: use a hash to store attributes, another hash for unique values for O(1) lookup, and sorted sets for range indexes
[12:10] chris6F: yeah
[12:10] chris6F: an ORM in Redis has issues with ACID though - especially atomicity
[12:10] sorens3n: redis hit the limit for me when i needed to do complex manipulation of the data

[12:21] chris6F: basically
[12:22] Omersd: :(
[12:22] chris6F: if you look at the source they call `Structure.new()` but that's what addStructure does too

[12:30] `3rdEden: the current pub/sub implementations do not scale :$

[13:35] mikegerwitz: eldios: That's not recommended. That defeats the purpose of using prototypes, beacuse you redefine the function each time it's instantiated
[13:36] `3rdEden: eldios: you can do function ctor(){ this.foo = function(){} }
[13:36] mikegerwitz: eldios: (which is also bad for performance)

[13:37] eldios: the this.foo soluction looks more neat to me
[13:37] bzinger has joined the channel
[13:38] mikegerwitz: eldios: Same issue, though ;) Make sure you understand the difference between the two. They are completely different
[13:38] mikegerwitz: eldios: this.foo assigns foo to the instance of the object. ctor.prototype.foo defines the method for *all* objects of type ctor
[13:39] eldios: mm.. good point.. thanks again mikegerwitz `3rdEden 
[13:39] eldios: =)
[13:39] mikegerwitz: eldios: when using prototypes, 'this' is also bound to the instance. Whereas in the above example `3rdEden posted, 'this' is bound to that function
[13:39] mikegerwitz: eldios: (when using 'this' inside the method, that is)
[13:40] `3rdEden: btw using ctor.prototype.foo vs this.foo makes no difference in performance
[13:40] mikegerwitz: `3rdEden: When calling, you're right.
[13:40] `3rdEden: http://jsperf.com/wheeeeeeeeeee
[13:40] eldios: still it should take more memory, at least in theory
[13:40] mikegerwitz: `3rdEden: But in the latter, you're redefining it each and every time.
[13:40] eldios: since it attaches the method to all instances
[13:40] eldios: *I suppose*
[13:41] `3rdEden: Chrome seems to be heavily optimized for `this` o._.o after running the test for a second time.. it's alloot faster lol
[13:42] awenkhh has joined the channel
[13:42] hellp has joined the channel
[13:42] mikegerwitz: `3rdEden: You aren't testing it correctly ;) What you would have to do is create the ctor, assign the prototype, then instantiate it many times
[13:42] hij1nx has joined the channel
[13:42] mikegerwitz: `3rdEden: Then do the same using 'this.foo' in the ctor.
[13:42] mikegerwitz: `3rdEden: Which I'm not sure you can do with that website

[13:43] `3rdEden: mikegerwitz: yes, than it's actually faster ;)
[13:44] mikegerwitz: `3rdEden: In that test, using the prototype should be slower, beacuse it has to traverse two objects ratehr than one (this.foo vs ctor.prototype.foo)
[13:44] mikegerwitz: `3rdEden: So that was correct, but for different reasons.

[17:09] lgomez: so... say I have an app.js file with all my express code and a cluster.js code that I use to run the app, where does that connect code go?
[17:10] chapel: tjholowaychuk: does it reverse proxy?
[17:10] tjholowaychuk: chapel: nope
[17:10] chapel: ah
[17:10] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[17:10] tjholowaychuk: that's why you can just ignore it really

[17:10] tjholowaychuk: 1 or N processes wont change the behavior
[17:10] chapel: yeah
[17:10] chapel: cluster is cool no doubt
[17:10] tjholowaychuk: proxy = slow
[17:10] tjholowaychuk: hha
[17:11] chapel: but I think people have misconceptions of what it is supposed to be
[17:11] tjholowaychuk: i dont want it personally
[17:11] chapel: which is fine
[17:11] tjholowaychuk: yeah I think some people think it's like the nginx replacement, but that is node
[17:11] chapel: thats the node way, use what you need
[17:11] lgomez: note that I can run `node app.js` and it works fine. I can also run `node cluster.js` and all goes well. But I can't figure out where the connect code goes.

[17:32] ryah: piscisaureus: i think there are a lot of 2000 computers around
[17:32] tjholowaychuk: kkaefer: haha that aws just a bad example, one sec
[17:32] kkaefer: tjholowaychuk: however, I think that this would require memory which aren't possible in regular expressions
[17:32] piscisaureus: ryah: really?
[17:32] tjholowaychuk: mikegerwitz: this in regexp form https://gist.github.com/966920

[17:32] tjholowaychuk: its not a problem to do it the way i am but regexp would be better if possible

[17:33] ryah: piscisaureus: it's not a requirement to work on 2k, but if it's a matter of a small feature - we should try to support it

[17:49] baudehlo: maybe v8 could make regexps pluggable like perl's are, so you could do "use pcre"; kinda like "use strict";
[17:49] Aria: Ah, yeah, lookaheads need postprocessing of the results (though grouping does 9/10 of what's needed)
[17:49] Aria: But recursive regexps? Those aren't regexps ;-)

[18:22] `3rdEden: andy_dawson there are only 2 reasons why it wouldn't be used.. 1) It's disabled by now.js or 2) You are making crossdomain / cross subdomain / cross port connections with your server.
[18:22] jeffhill: kieftrav: I'm not certain, but looking at the source it looks like you're doing a binary write but one of your characters is outside the range 0-255.

[18:24] `3rdEden: andy_dawson thats less than ideal, as you have to remember that there are uses behind a firewall that cant connect to other ports than the default ports

[18:34] xsyn: how do I stick an anchor inside a td in jade?
[18:34] xsyn: I've got
[18:34] xsyn:  td a(href='/dreams'/ + docs[d].id)= docs[d].title
[18:34] tjholowaychuk: xsyn: just indent like you would with anything else
[18:34] xsyn: but it's escaping the anchor
[18:34] tjholowaychuk: td\n  a(...)...
[18:34] tjholowaychuk: or
[18:34] tjholowaychuk: td: a(...)...
[18:34] tjholowaychuk: the trailing ":" inserts a block
[18:35] mape: ryah: sadly I do not. But I do know that after it happens if I try to restart the node process it gets the same error, ie can't even start it up again because it can't alloc mem.

[18:48] rmustacc: mape: Do you have a swap partition on there, since that's what's going to happen when it runs out of memeory is that someone will be swapped out, but once you start swapping your performance generally suffers a lot more.

[18:50] rmustacc: mape: Then the OS can't take the memory away and someone is going to have to get ENOMEM.
[18:50] mikegerwitz: mape: Which is nowhere near as efficient as a swap partition

[20:30] tmedema: Anyone here knows more about this? When I end a flash upload with a the string "DONE", it correctly interprets this as the upload being successful - an other string or null byte does not seem to do anything. Has this been documented by Adobe?

[20:31] context: so.. do most of you ignore the node_modules directory in your scm ?
[20:31] Aikar: no
[20:31] context: you commit it?
[20:31] Aikar: i put everything in it and ignore the depedencies section of package.json
[20:31] Aikar: i rather manage my own deps 
[20:31] admc1 has joined the channel
[20:32] context: i like having package.json keep track of what versions im using
[20:32] Aikar: with the way npm is designed now, imo it makes more sense to NOT let npm manage dependencies
[20:32] puffpio has joined the channel
[20:32] Aikar: especially if you want your code to be checked out over SCM instead of npm, they need to be there
[20:33] context: aikar: well if you are releasing it with npm you kind of have to have the deps in there.
[20:33] context: aikar: good point.
[20:33] Aikar: using npm ls in your project still lists all the versions
[20:33] Aikar: and no you dont, npm will see it as 1 large module
[20:33] marblo has joined the channel
[20:33] Aikar: it will THINK you depend on nothing
[20:33] Aikar: but youve already handled it getting its dependencies
[20:34] context: gotcha
[20:34] tmpvar: Aikar, thats an interesting approach
[20:34] wink_: bloodsucker: i'd talk with mraleph if i were you, its a contrived experiment, but im not sure why v8 thinks it's out of memory, it clearly isnt at the point where it bails
[20:34] tmpvar: seems like it would work well for websites, but not as well for libraries/frameworks
[20:34] Aikar: npm pretty much lays the files out in the same exact format, so id rather control what ver of a dependency my code is using

[20:35] kmiyashiro: what does the argument for next(); do in express?
[20:35] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[20:35] kmiyashiro: like next('duck');
[20:36] marblo: Hey guys, I just grabbed node, and I'm getting an error with socket.io "Assertion `b[1] == 0' failed.", I can paste the full error if you want.
[20:36] tjholowaychuk: kmiyashiro: next(err)
[20:36] xeodox has joined the channel
[20:36] tjholowaychuk: or next('route') which is special-cased to skip passed the route
[20:36] tjholowaychuk: useful for route-specific middleware
[20:36] kmiyashiro: so it goes to the next thing in the route and passes an error?
[20:37] kmiyashiro: so it's just for errors
[20:37] tjholowaychuk: well no
[20:37] tjholowaychuk: it does multiple things
[20:37] ultraflynn has left the channel
[20:37] tjholowaychuk: next(), next(err), or next('route')
[20:37] `3rdEden: marblo can you gist it?

[20:37] tjholowaychuk: because throwing with async stuff is no good
[20:37] colinclark has joined the channel
[20:37] kmiyashiro: oh
[20:38] kmiyashiro: but next(err) will still continue to the next part?
[20:38] Aikar: tmpvar: i say it works equally well for libs, since npm will be laying out your folder structure in the same fashion. by putting the dependencies in package.json your basically just saving the npm registry hdd space. the end result of a module 'installation' is still the same, except as the author of a library you get more assurance about what version of a dependency your module is actually using
[20:38] pifantastic has joined the channel
[20:38] kmiyashiro: it's just for passing errors to the logs?
[20:38] ryankirkman has left the channel
[20:38] kmiyashiro: or whatever error reporting
[20:38] tjholowaychuk: next(err) is only handled by middleware that have the signature (err, req, res, next)
[20:38] Charuru has joined the channel
[20:38] tjholowaychuk: skips all the rest
[20:39] zeade has joined the channel
[20:39] tjholowaychuk: until the error is resolved or logged etc
[20:39] marblo: yep
[20:39] tmpvar: Aikar, you get the same assurances by setting an =x.x.x in the dependency list.  I can see this being useful if you don't want to rely on the registry
[20:39] Aikar: tmpvar: and as a module author, when one of your dependencies is updated, you can do the npm update command in your modules project, test the new version, then deploy it, and not having people who install your module get newer versions of dependencies that hasnt ben tested.
[20:39] kmiyashiro: oh, so you can write middleware that takes (err, req, res, next) just like you do (req, res, next)?
[20:40] kmiyashiro: how does it know if the first arg is an err?
[20:40] Aikar: tmpvar: true, and can still work equally as well, if you do all your dependencies with exact version #s
[20:40] Aikar: but still gets hairy if npm updates how it does things, still adds a LITTLE uncertainty
[20:41] tmpvar: Aikar, sure. the same process can be applied when you let npm manage your deps -- you'd update the package.json / dependencies, pull down the updates, test, and publish a new version
[20:41] marblo: Here's the gist, it's not crazy long or anything: https://gist.github.com/967295
[20:41] Aikar: but thankfully i think isaacs said hes not gonna make any major changes for a while
[20:41] marblo: I guess if worst comes to worst, I can disable websockets or something.
[20:41] tmpvar: Aikar, too each his own I suppose.  I see value in your approach for certain projects
[20:42] marblo: This is running on a plain amazon linux instance on EC2
[20:42] Aikar: tmpvar: yep i agree with you if you list specific vers in package.json. the only real negative to not bothering to list is that it uses more hdd space on the npm servers
[20:42] saschagehlich: tjholowaychuk: could the next() call happen twice if I do response.render twice?
[20:42] tjholowaychuk: saschagehlich: yeah
[20:42] tjholowaychuk: why would you render twice
[20:42] tjholowaychuk: or are you using the callback?
[20:42] saschagehlich: dunno, maybe some callback hussle somewhere in my code
[20:42] tmpvar: Aikar, hehe.. I'm not sure anyone is worried about filling up the hdd on the npm registry :)
[20:42] `3rdEden: marblo which node and socket.io version are you running? As socket.io doesn't have any c++ bindings
[20:43] tmpvar: (except you)

[20:44] Renegade001: Could anyone give me some advice on how to get around vePortal (VPS management software installed by provider) hogging port 80 on directly requesting on the server's ip?
[20:44] `3rdEden: marblo try installing a stable release, instead of installing it directly out of the trunk
[20:44] Aikar: tmpvar: lol, what i meant is if you dont list any deps in package.json, the tarball is bigger, if you do list them with specific versions, its smaller and saves isaacs some hdd space. but not bothering to list em at all is a lazier approach and i am super lazy :P and with most modules being super small its trivial, but if you write a big module with lots of deps i could see being nice to isaacs and listing the deps in package.json with specific versions.

[22:00] dingomanatee: why not just track how long its been since the last keystroke.

[22:01] bloodsucker: node-inespector + chromium
[22:01] dingomanatee: no its coincidental.

[22:02] dingomanatee: validation occurs on a setInterval and looks at the time since lastKey
[22:02] tiglionabbit: dingomanatee: you're saying we should use polling instead of events?
[22:02] caolanm has joined the channel
[22:03] duncanbeevers: kmiyashiro: You pass it a function like window.addEventListener('resize', throttle(function() { do all this expensive redraw stuff }))
[22:03] tiglionabbit: yeah.  It returns a throttled version of the passed in function
[22:03] dingomanatee: Events should enable validation - polling should determine if the system has been idled long eough to justify validation. 
[22:03] addisonj_ has joined the channel
[22:03] tiglionabbit: dingomanatee: you're wrong, and I'm done :P.
[22:04] dingomanatee: Blur should also enable validation. 
[22:04] dingomanatee: okay
[22:04] addisonj_: looking for some decent ldap bindings for node, just search npm, don't see anything, but a few projects pop up on github, anyone use any of them?

[22:27] jwl: is there an easy way to serve a folder in a static http server so that I can reach a certain file with "localhost:8080/file.js" ?
[22:27] jwl: any npm packages for it or do i have to write my own
[22:27] tjholowaychuk: jwl: use connect's static() middleware
[22:28] jwl: tjholowaychuk: but then i have to write an express app?
[22:28] tjholowaychuk: connect(connect.static(__dirname + '/public')).listen(8080)
[22:28] tjholowaychuk: no
[22:28] tjholowaychuk: that's all you need right there

[22:33] tjholowaychuk: jwl: what's the request you are making?

[22:36] rmustacc: linnk: If I was going to be rather nitty, I would probably see if there was a pathlen in limits.h or the equivalent.
[22:36] linnk: ryah: hey, I'm having a try at your ticket https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/988 ... by backwards compatible do you mean that process.memoryUsage() should still be available?
[22:36] rmustacc: But I don't really think that's something worth changing.
[22:37] linnk: rmustacc: yea, thought about that too, but it's pretty minor, might give it a try when I've got everything else working
[22:37] rmustacc: Yup, I wouldn't really worry about it.
[22:37] linnk: rmustacc: but thanks for the limits.h hint ;)
[22:37] rmustacc: Realistically you won't see pids that high.
[22:38] linnk: that would be crazy thought... wonder how many processes you would need to have running
[22:38] linnk: *though
[22:38] perlmonkey2: SubStack: heh, I guess not many people are using dnode-perl to talk to dnode then :P
[22:38] rmustacc: Well, depends what folks do. For example on some OSes they jump to a high number like 100,000 by default.
[22:39] rmustacc: Once you get out of the system processes like init.
[22:39] rmustacc: But that's also not going to be beyond 256 characters.
[22:39] SubStack: perlmonkey2: I know 2 who've written some stuff with it
[22:39] SubStack: even got some patches
[22:39] linnk: nope, that's quite unrealistic
[22:39] `3rdEden: Thanks random person for th random comment lol
[22:40] perlmonkey2: SubStack: looks like that bug only shows up though when using dnode-perl with the JS dnode.

[23:52] tmpvar: tjholowaychuk, damn dude.. just tried that example you posted earlier

[23:53] quackslike: tjholowaychuk: what is the correct/best way to handle 404's with a custom page, using express? Is there a better way than adding last route as: all('/*', handler)
[23:54] tjholowaychuk: quackslike: typically that or better (IMO) to add a middleware at the bottom of your config that does this
[23:54] tjholowaychuk: because if it's at the bottom you know nothing else can handle it
[23:54] maximosis_: not yet going to install it now.
[23:54] tjholowaychuk: so just assume it's 404
[23:54] sjbreen: sorry but what does var c = require('connect'); c(c.static('/Users/tmpvar')).listen(3000); do. do it act like a web server for everything in folder tempvar?
[23:54] tjholowaychuk: sjbreen: serves static files
[23:54] tmpvar: sjbreen, correcto
[23:55] sjbreen: oh, like .html and such? but not .php
[23:55] tjholowaychuk: it would serve php as text haha
[23:55] tmpvar: sjbreen, only static files
[23:55] quackslike: ok, so at the bottom you just use app.all('/*', middlewareErrorHandler) and that is the last route, correct?
[23:55] tmpvar: right
[23:55] sjbreen: cool, thanks
[23:55] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[23:55] quackslike: ohh
[23:55] tjholowaychuk: quackslike: yeah but if you have say static() under app.use(app.router) then you would want something like
[23:56] quackslike: sorry, the bottom of the config..
[23:56] tjholowaychuk: app.use(function(req, res){ res.render('404'); });
[23:56] tjholowaychuk: at the bottom
[23:56] quackslike: tjholowaychuk: ahh thanks!
[23:56] tjholowaychuk: quackslike: the routes are just fancy middleware
[23:56] tjholowaychuk: they all boil down to the same thing

[23:59] quackslike: tjholowaychuk: they're way better than most.. and the examples go above and beyond most other example code.
[23:59] shimondoodkin: is there a gui module manager?
[23:59] tjholowaychuk: yeah i find examples more useful personally so i try to have lots of those
[23:59] shimondoodkin: (html gui)
[23:59] quackslike: tjholowaychuk: its the same with biggy-router too, it took me awhile to figure out they are ordered.. at least i think they are..  :-/
