[02:10] jesusabdullah: this sounds like something where context would matter
[02:10] gkatsev: yeah
[02:10] Gekz: I have a pretty big object.
[02:10] gkatsev: I'm writing PageRank.
[02:10] jesusabdullah: I'm guessing it's data?
[02:10] gkatsev: yeah
[02:10] jesusabdullah: I would come up with a good way to visualize your data
[02:10] jesusabdullah: and then work from there
[02:11] jesusabdullah: you're gonna want plots and/or summaries eventually
[02:11] gkatsev: yeah, I already have it. and I know it works for small data (6 nodes as opposed to 183811 nodes)
[02:11] gkatsev: but when I go for the big file, it dies on me
[02:11] chjj has joined the channel
[02:11] jesusabdullah: Try closer to 50 nodes
[02:11] jesusabdullah: like, step it up by orders of 10
[02:11] jesusabdullah: roughly
[02:12] jesusabdullah: instead of going all out first try

[02:14] jesusabdullah: Yeah, typically boring for loops are fastest
[02:15] gkatsev: yeah, but I didn't realize how much faster
[02:15] jesusabdullah: oh, also, I believe you'll get a speed increase if you set Object.keys(obj).length to a variable and then reference that variable
[02:15] gkatsev: yes
[02:15] owen1: BombStrike: callback.apply works. this is what i understand so far: even though i have a function that belong to a class. the fact that it's part of this class doesn't really matter, since i call this function with different context.
[02:16] gkatsev: dammit, I might have to rewrite this in python. Not that it'll be hard. But would be nice to get this working in node
[02:16] owen1: i can set 'this' to be whatever i want. if that's the case, it seems like the value of having my functions as part of a class is not as important as other oo languages.
[02:16] Gekz: (i = 0, ii = Object.keys(obj).length; i < ii; ++i) { ... } 
[02:16] jesusabdullah: gkatsev: I'd figure out why it's breaking first. That said, python is probably technically a better choice
[02:17] Gekz: owen1: there are no classes in JS.
[02:17] Gekz: just prototype chains.
[02:17] gkatsev: jesusabdullah: no clue. Here's the code. https://github.com/gkatsev/pagerank/blob/master/pagerank.js
[02:18] jesusabdullah: gkatsev: What error(s) do you get?
[02:18] owen1: gkatsev: yeah. i mean class, but it's actually constructor function. i use the new keyword to instantiate an object.
[02:18] Gekz: ewww
[02:18] Gekz: I _detest_ this style of Javascript
[02:18] owen1: Gekz: ^^
[02:18] Gekz: why do people refuse to use semicolons these days 
[02:18] Gekz: why prefixing shit with commas 
[02:18] gkatsev: jesusabdullah: I dont get errors. The problem is that when I try to get the pageRank of a page (line 90) I get undefined. Which basically makes my algorithm useless
[02:18] Gekz: stop trying to force JS to be Python, gosh.
[02:18] SubStack: Gekz: mostly unimportant things
[02:19] jesusabdullah: Gekz: Don't be a bitch, bitch.
[02:19] SubStack: especially when you split everything up into lots of reusable modules and services
[02:19] Gekz: not really, the language doesn't lend itself to being semi-colonless
[02:19] Gekz: with its continuous use of braces for structure control
[02:19] SubStack: everybody can write code their own way and we only all need to agree at the api layer
[02:19] stagas: Gekz: you don't really need semicolons
[02:19] jesusabdullah: gkatsev: Try it with 20-50 nodes instead of all or nothing
[02:20] owen1: Gekz: you don't like using new keyword or were u talking to someone else?
[02:20] Gekz: owen1: I have said nothing of the new keyword.
[02:20] gkatsev: jesusabdullah: I feel it'll probably work. Let me see try it.
[02:21] gkatsev: jesusabdullah: let me know if you find something glaringly obviously wrong in the code.
[02:21] owen1: Gekz: ok. sorry. i just read that that's the preferred way to constract object - http://book.mixu.net/ch6.html

[02:23] WarheadsSE: jesusabdullah: why is python a better choice?
[02:23] WarheadsSE: Gekz: which book

[02:24] WarheadsSE: was about to say.. peoples, object != class :p
[02:25] owen1: Gekz: maybe, but this guide is amazing
[02:25] ningu: python is a better choice if you like snakes
[02:25] gkatsev: jesusabdullah: works no problem with 26 nodes.
[02:25] owen1: Gekz: he calles it Class pattern.
[02:26] jesusabdullah: WarheadsSE: numpy, basically. It has the libraries and the history of being used for more computationally intensive things like that.
[02:26] jesusabdullah: WarheadsSE: also for python the c binding layer is much less in terms of overhead.
[02:27] jesusabdullah: WarheadsSE: Other than that, nothing intrinsic about python as a language. It's more about the runtime and the libaries
[02:27] jesusabdullah: If I had a "numpy for javascript" I would be a *very* happy camper, lemme tell ya's
[02:28] jesusabdullah: What I'd like to see is a nice way to write what maxogden calls "gut servers" in python
[02:28] gkatsev: isn't there someone working on porting numpy/scipy to js?
[02:28] jesusabdullah: I don't think the concept really needs such a name but the idea is to throw raw data at the server and have transformed data come out
[02:28] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[02:28] jesusabdullah: oh I have no idea
[02:29] jesusabdullah: I've had like 2 or 3 aborted attempts at porting parts of it to pure js
[02:29] WarheadsSE: jesusabdullah: for that point then, I'll argue Perl :p
[02:29] jesusabdullah: pdl's less popular, but if it's what you like then more power to you
[02:29] gkatsev: dammit, how can I get this to scale up to 183811 nodes?
[02:30] jesusabdullah: perl's quite popular in bioinformatics, mostly because bioinformaticists were there first

[02:32] hotchkiss: i could obviously just util.pump the file but .. wondering if express has a configure for that -
[02:32] gkatsev: jesusabdullah: assuing it works with 500, would I just have x amount of objects with at most 500 properties?
[02:33] jesusabdullah: You could I guess but I'd keep scaling it up until you find a region where it breaks
[02:33] WarheadsSE: silly ?, where is it dying?
[02:33] WarheadsSE: aka, how many looops in, is it making it inside the loop? etc etc
[02:34] jaxzin_ has joined the channel
[02:34] jesusabdullah: Isn't that what we're trying to find out?
[02:34] gkatsev: WarheadsSE: the problem isn't the loop. it's that the object that holds my pagerank values just dies and only gives me undefined the second pass
[02:34] jaxzin_ has left the channel
[02:35] WarheadsSE: then you're handling something wrong, or, you're causing an overrun
[02:35] jaxzin has joined the channel
[02:35] WarheadsSE: so, at 500 it works.. but with 180K it outright fails
[02:37] gkatsev: so, I guess the question is, once I find where it does. Where do I go from there?
[02:37] gkatsev: s/./:/
[02:38] jesusabdullah: depends. The goal here is to find a failing case with a more manageable amount of nodes (I'd think?)
[02:38] jesusabdullah: You may also want to start console-logging stuff
[02:39] gkatsev: well, I have to be able to work with all 183811 items.

[02:41] jesusabdullah: idk, patterns are a label
[02:41] SubStack: methods of technique are not things that deserve labels
[02:41] jesusabdullah: sometimes a useful one
[02:41] WarheadsSE: agreed.. why does everything have to have a buzz-word name ?
[02:41] chrisdickinson: well, in this case, because i have to refer to it a bunch in the thing i'm writing.
[02:41] jesusabdullah: well, that's the difference right? You shouldn't get all hopped up on "OH SHIT THIS IS THE DERPITUDE PATTERN" but if you want to talk about some "pattern" and you have a common vocabulary for it, more power to you
[02:42] SubStack: chrisdickinson: you could just call that a prototypical object?
[02:42] chrisdickinson: SubStack: maybe. this is targeted at co-workers who are (traditionally) python devs.
[02:42] SubStack: or "an object" probably works just fine
[02:42] gkatsev: chrisdickinson: it's just a constructor...
[02:43] boltR has joined the channel
[02:43] SubStack: it usually matters far more how you use something than what it is

[02:43] chrisdickinson: i've been using the term "class" thus far, since in practice, it works almost exactly like python's class system.

[02:44] WarheadsSE: but. its not a class

[02:44] SubStack: and don't use bullshit terms like "actors" or "patterns" that don't convey very much as descriptive labels
[02:45] SubStack: and are more of a signaling exercise to show how well-read the author is

[02:46] SubStack: every time
[02:47] jesusabdullah: luckily chrisdickinson you're not substack so you don't have to think that ;)
[02:47] chrisdickinson: I'm just looking for terminology that won't get me tarred and feathered for saying that javascript has classes, basically.
[02:47] SubStack: luckily indeed!
[02:47] derekv: Every time I see pattern I think about redundancy, boilerplate, and duplication of effort
[02:47] jesusabdullah: I'd just say something like

[02:47] WarheadsSE: :)
[02:47] chrisdickinson: WarheadsSE: blergh.
[02:47] jesusabdullah: "okay so we're going to call this a class even though it's totally not. DEAL WITH IT *sunglasses*"
[02:47] SubStack: chrisdickinson: just say "javascript pretty much has classes"
[02:47] jesusabdullah: THATS HOW I ROLL FUCKERS
[02:47] WarheadsSE: it explains the differences from classes, is all im saying
[02:48] SubStack: they just look a little differently
[02:48] jesusabdullah: "post-de-facto classes"
[02:48] chrisdickinson: jesusabdullah: that's thus far my favorite answer
[02:48] SubStack: you don't need to use fancy words to say that
[02:48] jesusabdullah: chrisdickinson: Include the "deal with it" graphic

[02:49] chrisdickinson: the gist is that i'm writing a style guide for javascript for coworkers, but eventually will publish this elsewhere.
[02:49] SubStack: even if that were true it wouldn't mean anything by itself
[02:50] chrisdickinson: SubStack: if it's any consolation, there's a section on modules that is, essentially, just a link to your github profile.

[02:51] SubStack: although I have plenty of messy stuff too

[02:51] chrisdickinson: quoth that section, "If it cannot be described in a sentence, your module may be too big."
[02:52] SubStack: well sometimes very small modules are very difficult to describe succinctly
[02:52] SubStack: and sometimes very large modules that should be split up can be described succinctly
[02:53] SubStack: the implementation and description domains are not 1:1

[03:16] jesusabdullah: ag4ve: the first argument to a middleware *is* the request object. The second argument *is* the response object.

[03:31] SubStack: chrisdickinson: nice art
[03:31] evilnate: gkatsev++
[03:31] gkatsev: WarheadsSE: also, yeah, the problem is inside the pageRank function.
[03:32] SubStack: my style optimizes for ability to move blocks around by line and secondarily saving vertical space
[03:32] WarheadsSE: @ while, or for loops?
[03:32] gkatsev: basically the whole while loop
[03:32] yaymukund: Anyone succeed getting mocks/spies working with mocha asynchronously? I'd like two tests to run asynchronously-- one calling the mocked function, the other calling the original version.
[03:32] WarheadsSE: :) while loops can be fun.. yes..
[03:33] SubStack: yaymukund: that sounds like an amazing amount of work
[03:33] gkatsev: WarheadsSE: but as I said above, this does work for smaller... objects
[03:33] SubStack: I like to actually perform real IO in my tests

[03:35] yaymukund: SubStack: ah, okay. I'll try that approach. jasmine seems to do it, but I don't like jasmine for other reasons.

[03:38] jesusabdullah: but tap ain't bad
[03:38] SubStack: owen1: with tap you can just execute the file
[03:38] SubStack: like node yourtest.js

[03:39] jesusabdullah: someday I'm going to be like, "bitch im in charge of vows now
[03:39] SubStack: or you can use the tap cli tool to tap test/*.js or whatevs

[03:39] jesusabdullah: and I'm gonna rewrite the shit out of it
[03:39] spion has joined the channel
[03:39] jesusabdullah: it still won't be the ideal for tap die-hards but it'll take some of the lessons
[03:39] SubStack: jesusabdullah: rewrite it to module.exports = require('tap')
[03:39] yaymukund: SubStack: that looks very interesting. I like letting node take care of the async stuff
[03:40] jesusabdullah: SubStack: More like, you should be able to run a vows test without the vows test runner
[03:40] jesusabdullah: SubStack: and nested levels of "topics" should Actually Work
[03:40] SubStack: yaymukund: yep it's pretty great, you just t.end() when you want your test to be done
[03:40] SubStack: or you can t.plan() the number of assertions which calls t.end() for you if you do that
[03:40] jesusabdullah: also a few moire things
[03:40] jesusabdullah: I don't actually like t.plan I'll be honest
[03:40] gkatsev: dammit, twish already exists
[03:41] jesusabdullah: your MOm already exists
[03:41] gkatsev: she does
[03:41] gkatsev: http://code.google.com/p/twish/
[03:41] jesusabdullah: glad we got that one settled
[03:41] gkatsev: eh, newest commit is 2008
[03:41] SubStack: jesusabdullah: t.plan() lets you guard against the case where a callback never actually fires and your test passes incorrectly as a result
[03:41] gkatsev: I think I'm safe
[03:41] jesusabdullah: dangit I spilled stuff against myself
[03:42] jesusabdullah: SubStack: I get that, I just don't like counting how many tests I have
[03:42] SubStack: it also guards against the case where a callback might fire more times than you wanted it to
[03:42] SubStack: or not enough times
[03:42] jesusabdullah: like I get the point but that doesn't mean I have to like it u noe
[03:42] SubStack: jesusabdullah: that's why it's optional

[04:03] WarheadsSE:  what do you mean by "perplexity is 4 times the same"
[04:04] gkatsev: preplexity, which is calculated via the preplexity function.
[04:04] gkatsev: page rank should terminate when the value for preplexity is the same value after 4 iterations of the pagerank algorithm
[04:05] WarheadsSE: thank you
[04:05] gkatsev: and by equal, I mean, if you compare only the integer value and ignore the decimals

[04:37] westg: not long polling
[04:37] westg: i mean regular one way ajax
[04:37] westg: see the majority of stuff that the client is going to send back to the server needs to also be broadcasted to all other clients in a specific group
[04:38] westg: therefore I could use ajax and then socket.io to emit from the server or I can just do it all in socket.io
[04:38] gkatsev: jesusabdullah: what about piopio? it's a bird.
[04:38] gkatsev: was a bird.
[04:38] westg: but yeah if the fallback is xhr then I guess socket.io effectively cuts out ajax

[06:54] konobi: isaacs: ping
[06:54] isaacs: hi
[06:55] isaacs: konobi: got a puzzle?
[06:55] konobi: howdy... currently trying to get node-tap to bend to my will but failing miserably
[06:56] konobi: the version of TAP that we're using states that we need to emit a head (with the version) for each tap stream... but i'm boggled as to how to get it to do that
[06:57] isaacs: konobi: what's the head look like?
[06:57] konobi: TAP version 13
[06:58] erujolc has joined the channel
[06:58] konobi: mainly i'd like to understand why self.write or self.emit('data') in the constructor won't work
[06:58] isaacs: konobi: just like that, literally?
[06:58] isaacs: konobi: it needs to wait for the first write.
[06:58] konobi: (for TapProducer that is)
[06:58] isaacs: patch coming soon
[06:59] isaacs: konobi: is it the version of node-tap, or the version of the tap protocol?
[06:59] konobi: the protocol
[06:59] isaacs: konobi: also, how do you keep finding this mind-breakingly over-strict tap consumers?
[06:59] mikeal has joined the channel
[06:59] konobi: ^_^
[07:00] isaacs: "Konobi's tap consumer walks into a bar, and shoots everyone who does not set their beer down on their assigned coaster."
[07:00] konobi: (sorry _really_ laggy connection here)
[07:00] isaacs: i'm not sure which version of the protocol node-tap implements.
[07:00] isaacs: maybe i should just call it TAP version PI or something? ;P
[07:00] konobi: i'm just going against tap4j right now... but i've got a list of fixes to make and this was one to wet my teeth on... but damn it's tricky
[07:01] konobi: 13
[07:01] isaacs: grr.  tap4j;
[07:01] konobi: i've been fixing it though =0)
[07:01] isaacs: it's not just strict, it's strict in completely nonsensical ways that make it unusable with any other tap.
[07:02] isaacs: seriously.  you should be able to throw the contents of the phone book at a tap consumer, and it should tell you how many names start wih "ok" and how many start with "not ok"
[07:02] konobi: also dealing with runner being a tap producer tiseld... *squint*
[07:02] isaacs: granted, node-tap has bugs.
[07:03] isaacs: it's overdue for a rewrite
[07:03] konobi: yeah, it's the yamlish that's been problematic for the most part
[07:03] isaacs: the test-writing interface is nice, but the harness/runner/producer/consumer stuff is a bit tricky
[07:03] paulwe has joined the channel
[07:03] isaacs: tap4j has a parser that doesn't parse valid yamlish, is the problem.
[07:03] konobi: yeah... i might take a swing at it
[07:04] isaacs: konobi: if you'er actually interested in improving node tap (and not just writing a whole different tap thing in node, which could also be interesting) then we should talk about it.
[07:05] ag4ve: where is ':id' stored in the request?
[07:05] konobi: tap4j uses a plain yaml parser... but it was getting very confused... i fixed that.. but the JDSON quoting was neededf
[07:05] konobi: isaacs: agreed
[07:06] isaacs: jdson?
[07:06] isaacs: oh, json
[07:06] isaacs: konobi: yeah, but it breaks other things
[07:06] isaacs: konobi: i'd like to rewrite it simpler.  it's still basically my original weekend prototype, plus lots of duct tape.
[07:06] konobi: isaacs: yeah... that "escaping" isn't mentioned in the yamlish spec... i should really talk to andy about it
[07:07] isaacs: konobi: i'd like the output to do the indentation thing, rather than gathering the results up into one tap stream
[07:07] konobi: shame i couldn't make the QA hackathon at the end of the month
[07:07] konobi: subtests?
[07:07] isaacs: it's more programmatic overhead the way i'm doing it, more complexity than necessary
[07:07] isaacs: konobi: yeah
[07:07] konobi: yeah... iirc, it's not defined in the spec yet though
[07:07] isaacs: right now, subtests are just sort of massaged into a single stream at the top level
[07:08] isaacs: konobi: honestly? i care WAY less about any published spec than about simple usage, clear output, and interoperability with other tools.
[07:08] konobi: yeah... which is what i'm having to contend with
[07:08] isaacs: the spec is a means to that end, not an end in itself.
[07:08] konobi: yeah... i need to sit down with andy and curtis in a room for a few hours to really nail it
[07:09] ryan0x2 has joined the channel
[07:09] isaacs: konobi: it'd be better to not write a spec, and instead just document really thoroughly How It's Done.
[07:09] konobi: ACTION just realized we could have probably backchanneled this... but meh... =0)
[07:09] isaacs: like, every tap implementation that matters and is not currently under development.  documnet it.
[07:10] konobi: yeah... the main one is Test::Builder... which is pretty nice

[09:50] SubStack: why rewrite it
[09:51] damiano: at the moment i do not have a node.js app....... i only have a website developed using cakephp... but i would like to create it in node
[09:51] SubStack: why not build new things in node and leave the existing code alone?
[09:52] damiano: 50% in php 50% in node ??
[09:52] SubStack: why expend effort building the same thing twice?
[09:53] SubStack: until there are good reasons to switch I don't see the point

[10:12] Country has joined the channel
[10:13] ningu: anyway, jade and ejs are fairly comparable in terms of what they can be used for, as far as I can tell -- so it's just your personal preference. take a look at both, there are some obvious differences
[10:13] ningu: differences in syntax but probably not much, ultimately, in terms of functionality

[10:17] damiano: ok
[10:17] damiano: right
[10:17] SubStack: I don't even think people should be using templates at all.
[10:17] SubStack: maybe for very CRUDy apps
[10:17] SubStack: certainly nothing like the kinds of apps I usually write
[10:18] ningu: SubStack: I was going to say, some apps are much more content-heavy than others
[10:18] yaymukund has joined the channel
[10:18] ningu: for my apps it's unrealistic
[10:19] SubStack: pulling down content with ajax is just so much nicer to deal with
[10:19] ningu: I can imagine other ways of binding data to html -- but there are too many conditions
[10:20] ningu: that's where templates really help
[10:20] damiano: at the moment i do not like Express.JS so much because it seems that does not support MCV so well.... i mean if i write a route like: app.get('/users', ...)       then i need to write: app.get('/users/action1', UserController, ..)   app.get('/users/action2', UserController, ...) so i need to write all the action myself, but a MVC framework should check what are the actions that a controller has
[10:20] damiano: maybe i'm wrong
[10:21] ningu: damiano: I don't think MVC per se says anything about whether controllers are auto-loaded or not, or all have the same actions
[10:21] commando has joined the channel
[10:21] SubStack: MVC doesn't say anything
[10:21] ningu: but you can check express-namespace or express-resource for example
[10:21] SubStack: MVC is completely undescriptive
[10:22] ningu: MVC to me mostly just means separating logic from display
[10:22] risto has joined the channel

[10:24] staar2: does any of you host the node on own server ?
[10:24] ningu: SubStack: fair enough -- although I separate models and controllers enough that I think it's reasonable to distinguish them, so e.g. I can write scripts that require('./db')
[10:24] commando: I m using locally
[10:25] ningu: and the mongoose hooks will all be pulled in
[10:25] SubStack: insin: I'm suspicious in the other direction, when existing apps are turned into reusable frameworks there tends to be a lot of baggage
[10:25] ningu: damiano: ok, but what exactly is the issue?
[10:25] SubStack: damiano: you can just use programming for that you know
[10:25] ningu: commando: you mean from the client side?
[10:25] insin: SubStack: yeah, works both ways :)
[10:25] insin: you're taking someone else's compromises, too
[10:25] SubStack: there is no rule that says that your app routes need to all be in the same file at the root level
[10:26] commando: yes ningu
[10:26] Hui_Nan has joined the channel
[10:26] Hui_Nan: hi all!
[10:26] ningu: commando: so just load jquery with a script tag... it's just html
[10:26] commando: In jade file
[10:26] ningu: jade lets you write script tags
[10:26] ningu: again it's just html, ultimately :P
[10:27] commando: if i want serve-side
[10:27] Hui_Nan: Is it possible to organize a local npm repository (like CPAN-mini in Perl)?
[10:27] ningu: commando: you just said it was client-side
[10:27] commando: so where in use jquery ningu
[10:27] ningu: if it's server-side I don't know what you're trying to do
[10:27] commando: I want both side
[10:27] ningu: you can't open a dialog on the server
[10:28] damiano: ningu, no no it is not an ISSUE.... I only mean if i have 10 controllers with 10 actions i need to write 100 routes instead of 10
[10:29] SubStack: Hui_Nan: it is possible but requires some couchdb knowledge
[10:29] damiano: so a website maybe be not clear to change
[10:29] ningu: damiano: if there are common elements to those routes there are many ways to abstract them, as SubStack said just use programming :P
[10:29] ningu: you can auto-generate them too
[10:29] damiano: ningu, i know that i can use programming :-) i only asking how is it possible that a mvc framework does not support it
[10:29] ningu: it just depends how much code they actually share
[10:29] damiano: only this.
[10:29] damiano: not an issue
[10:29] commando has left the channel
[10:29] ningu: how does it not support it?
[10:30] ningu: it doesn't prevent you from doing it
[10:30] SubStack: also: stop using frameworks
[10:30] damiano: ningu, i mean that passing a module and a framework must to see the actions
[10:30] SubStack: use libraries
[10:30] ningu: damiano: not sure what you mean
[10:30] Hui_Nan: SubStack: I have that knowledge. Could you point me to docs?
[10:31] Druid_ has joined the channel
[10:31] ningu: damiano: if you mean you want every method in a controller to be auto-detected as an action or something, I suppose you can write something to do that, but it certainly isn't a standard MVC feature
[10:31] yawNO has joined the channel
[10:32] ningu: control flow is almost never that simple
[10:32] damiano: ningu if i need routes like
[10:32] damiano:  /users/*
[10:32] timoxley: damiano or use something more full-featured like rails
[10:32] SubStack: Hui_Nan: do you want a mirror or an empty local server?
[10:32] damiano: whenre * could be
[10:32] damiano:  /add / remove /modify ecc ecc
[10:32] SubStack: Hui_Nan: here's how to set up a mirror at any rate https://blog.caurea.org/2012/01/31/local-npm-registry-mirror.html
[10:32] damiano: i need to write 4 routes
[10:33] sreeix has joined the channel
[10:33] ningu: damiano: as I said, you can auto-generate those routes if you want, nothing is preventing you
[10:33] damiano: k
[10:33] briancray has joined the channel
[10:33] ningu: I mean, *somewhere* you will have to write four routes, but if you want to reuse them in many controllers nothing is preventing you
[10:33] timoxley: damiano also have a look at express-resource
[10:33] SubStack: Hui_Nan: if you want to set up a local version you can probably just replicate only the design docs after setting up the admin rights
[10:33] ningu: timoxley: I already said that :)
[10:34] Nexxy has left the channel
[10:34] SubStack: I disagree with this idea of "models" and "controllers"
[10:34] SubStack: keep in mind that somebody invented that, it is not some fundamental feature of reality
[10:34] Hui_Nan: SubStack: sometimes I have to work offline, so I need somemeans to install packages from the LAN
[10:35] ningu: SubStack: it's very useful for me to be able to isolate certain model logic -- for example, auto-lowercasing a field in mongo or pre-save hooks -- that will need to run no matter what is accessing hte database
[10:35] joshontheweb has joined the channel
[10:35] SubStack: Hui_Nan: ah then that link should describe what you need then
[10:35] timoxley: ningu you're talking orm, SubStack is disagreeing with models entirely
[10:36] SubStack: I also disagree with orm, at least insofar as that is a "thing"
[10:36] Hui_Nan: SubStack: thank you!
[10:36] damiano: yeah guys
[10:36] damiano: thank you 
[10:36] ningu: timoxley: I don't really care what terms you use but the functionality I'm talking about is something I'm not willing to dispense with
[10:36] damiano: express-resources is the thing i asked
[10:36] damiano: :D
[10:37] timoxley: SubStack so you believe not model domain at all instead model, say, the request? or? I'm not sure how to think about your app without models
[10:37] ningu: if deleting item A will always require deleting associated B's I don't want to have to manually code that every time
[10:37] SubStack: all this talk of "models"
[10:38] eugs51 has joined the channel
[10:38] ningu: I don't really care in a sense how that's accomplished but I want it to be in one place in my code and not get in the way
[10:38] SubStack: the problem that you're ACTUALLY solving in these apps is that you have some state and need it to persist across restarts and to sit on disk because it might not all fit in memory
[10:38] timoxley: SubStack eg, how do you encapsulate a User and all of her related data?
[10:38] timoxley: …without a traditional model
[10:38] SubStack: I don't have "users" I have data
[10:39] ningu: SubStack: in my case persistence is a much bigger issue, and also data integrity is important
[10:39] dtrejo: SubStack: I fixed it, now dont press the button: http://downsound.jit.su/linkopener.html
[10:39] SubStack: ningu: sure but those are separate from tying the database backend to the object model
[10:40] damiano: ningu, timoxley i dont understand one thing...i read express-resources DOC, it is useful and I surely will use it, but i see that if the request is GET /forums it calls /index (correctly) BUT if the request is POST to /forums it will call "create" method.... but can i change it ? example....if i also what that post request will call "index" method" can I ?
[10:40] ningu: my data is fairly complex and I want a way to break it down into manageable pieces and specify various requirements in one place that will be enforced
[10:40] ningu: and the fact that it can be separated from the control flow of the app is a huge benefit
[10:40] timoxley: damiano why would you want a post to call index?
[10:41] timoxley: damiano oh, to display a thing to the user
[10:41] ningu: models are declarative, controllers are imperative. that's the issue basically, as I see it.
[10:42] SubStack: I take issue with the categories presented
[10:42] adambeynon has joined the channel
[10:42] SubStack: I don't think breaking down the problem domain into models and controllers gives the best interfaces
[10:42] ningu: you mean user interfaces?
[10:43] ningu: or programmatic interfaces?
[10:43] conner has joined the channel
[10:43] SubStack: programming interfaces
[10:43] timoxley: damiano handle post, then redirect to index, or simply render index template
[10:43] timoxley: damiano or use the same function for both and have some kind of switch in there
[10:43] ningu: damiano: that's why I don't use express-resource, because I want more ability to tweak the control flow
[10:43] adrianF has joined the channel
[10:44] damiano: timoxley, no no it is just an example .... i mean how can i call a different method
[10:44] timoxley: damiano ideally you're not rendering anything on the server so you don't have this kind of issue
[10:44] ningu: SubStack: so how would you make sure e.g. a particular mongo field is always lowercased, wherever it's set in your node app and also wherever it's set in a script?
[10:45] timoxley: ningu like you always access teh db via your orm, instead you always access it via your new SubStack api.
[10:45] Commando has joined the channel
[10:45] timoxley: which handles that for you
[10:45] ningu: timoxley: that's what I'm asking about
[10:46] ningu: I didn't say it was impossible but without being SubStack I can't imagine it
[10:46] damiano: timoxley, ? i don't understand:  you're not rendering anything on the server so you don't have this kind of issue
[10:46] Commando: ningu: In Client side i have an error
[10:47] timoxley: damiano client side rendering. Server handles one request at a time. POST will simply return a status code and perhaps some json data. index returns json. everything json.
[10:48] ningu: timoxley: and how does the client get templates to render the json?
[10:48] insin: and for non-JS user agents? Just being an API for an app is a different problem
[10:48] insin: well, not completely different, obv :)
[10:48] SubStack: ningu: if the code to set a field all goes through the same place then it's simple to make sure it's lowercased
[10:48] SubStack: but that need not necessarily be a "model"
[10:48] damiano: timoxley, yes i know but how to call different method using express-resources (instead of default method)
[10:48] SubStack: classifying abstractions in those terms gives other unrelated baggage
[10:49] timoxley: damiano can't. you'd need to alias it.
[10:49] timoxley: damiano but it seems like that shouldn't be an issue since if you want such a thing then you probably don't want express-resource
[10:50] timoxley: SubStack baggage such as…
[10:50] take_cheeze has joined the channel
[10:50] timoxley: insin what non-js user agents?
[10:50] SubStack: such as decomposing the problem into a singular type of object that represents each kind of data in your backend for instance
[10:51] shinuza has joined the channel
[10:51] SubStack: thinking in terms of things instead of transformations on data
[10:51] timoxley: SubStack verbs instead of nouns
[10:52] damiano: timoxley, i dont understand if for EVERY Post request it routes it to /creates
[10:52] ningu: damiano: just rewrite express-resource for your logic
[10:52] lirla has joined the channel
[10:52] ningu: it's like 50 lines of code
[10:52] timoxley: damiano it doesn't
[10:52] SubStack: damiano: just use another library or no library at all
[10:52] SubStack: one that fits better with your mental model of the necessary computation
[10:52] oldsplice has joined the channel
[10:53] damiano: ok
[10:53] ningu: SubStack: hey, you might know the answer to this, I've asked on #socket.io but no one seemed to know what I was talking about...
[10:53] damiano: timoxley, what did you say that it doesn't i'm looking at /forums example......and it always reutes to "create" method
[10:53] be5invis: Hey guys, are there any node-based tex-svg converter?
[10:53] ningu: it has to do with this: http://stephenbelanger.com/2011/09/21/how-to-make-socket-io-work-behind-nginx-mostly/
[10:54] timoxley: damiano the "create" method != "/create"
[10:54] damiano: timoxley, yes i wrote wrong
[10:54] SubStack: ningu: why would you want to fight nginx when there are plenty of other http routers that just work
[10:54] damiano: i mean......why a POST request will be always routed to "create" METHOD
[10:55] ningu: the question is whether I can change my nginx configuration so that monkey-patching socket.io is not necessary. I was debugging it yesterday and nginx seemed to think keep-alive was set regardless of the socket.io code being patched
[10:55] timoxley: damiano because it's trying to help you create a restful controller.
[10:55] ningu: SubStack: such as...?
[10:55] SubStack: node-http-proxy and bouncy for 2
[10:55] damiano: timoxley, ok, and it is correct....BUT can I not change it ?
[10:55] timoxley: damiano just alias it if you want to change it. I mean why does it matter what it's called
[10:55] ningu: I like that nginx can automatically handle gzip for me, for one
[10:55] ningu: and caching
[10:56] damiano: timoxley, i can alias it but OUTSIDE app.resource, right?
[10:56] ningu: and haproxy is a bit more than I want to deal with at the moment
[10:56] ningu: I'll check out node-http-proxy
[10:56] insin: if you're fighting a particular abstraction from the get-go, perhaps it's not the one you need ;)
[10:56] timoxley: damiano what insin said
[10:57] timoxley: damiano I think you're looking for a central place to manage your routes
[10:57] timoxley: damiano doesn't really exist in node
[10:57] SubStack: there are lots of abstractions for managing routes and mapping routes to resources
[10:58] insin: zilllions
[10:58] damiano: ok
[10:58] staar2: is there something lightweight in node for executing jobs, timing adding into queue ? 
[10:58] timoxley: damiano I mean doesn't exist in terms of "out of the box it works like rails"
[10:59] oldsplice: staar2: like a scheuduler?
[10:59] damiano: ah ok
[10:59] SubStack: timoxley: those exist too
[10:59] timoxley: damiano SubStack  is probably right
[10:59] damiano: timoxley, do you use express.js ? or no framework ?
[10:59] staar2: oldsplice: somth like that
[10:59] SubStack: just nobody uses them because they clash with the node ethos
[10:59] timoxley: damiano restify
[10:59] oldsplice: staar2: can I message you?
[10:59] damiano: timoxley, https://github.com/mcavage/node-restify
[10:59] damiano: ?
[10:59] staar2: ys
[10:59] timoxley: damiano that one
[11:00] SubStack: staar2: there are lots of job queueing/scheduling libraries, `npm search job` pulls up quite a few
[11:00] damiano: timoxley, it uses express?
[11:00] damiano: it is similar
[11:01] timoxley: damiano similar not the same.
[11:01] damiano: yes sure
[11:01] damiano: ok
[11:02] damiano: timoxley, i would like to organize my code...at the moment ALL the exmaples i have seen ....have all the code in app.js
[11:02] damiano: i think is better to create more then one file
[11:02] damiano: file for routes
[11:02] damiano: file for settings
[11:02] damiano: helpers... ecc ecc
[11:02] damiano: no?
[11:02] timoxley: damiano I used to think that too, but I'm starting to feel like more files = more overhead
[11:03] damiano: not clear?
[11:04] timoxley: damiano break it into more files when you need to. start small.
[11:04] damiano: k
[11:04] insin: Not keen on directory explosion frameworks either, just let me hook up URLs to my code in a sane way
[11:06] timoxley: damiano this video made me reconsider my whole development approach http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0 also http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy

[11:23] nbari: I have made this http://pastebin.com/zMyS2h0S, the idea is to get via jquery long-poll data from a redis server
[11:23] nbari: so far is working
[11:23] nbari: but when loading the page, if no data is available, the jquery exits because of a timeout
[11:24] nbari: so wondering if anyone could give me a hint on how to configure / mix redis with http (node.js) module to deal with timeouts
[11:25] eugs51 has joined the channel
[11:25] dannyamey has joined the channel
[11:26] astropirate: nbari, hit it with another request :)
[11:27] astropirate: timeouts are bound to happen
[11:27] nbari: how ?
[11:27] astropirate: how what
[11:27] nbari: also I on the console i get duplicated messages
[11:27] astropirate: make another request?
[11:28] nbari: I mean, on the server i run node redis.js, that opens port 3000 and waits until a message is published on redis
[11:28] stagas: nbari: one for the favicon
[11:28] stagas: is
[11:28] nbari: after that i open on my browser http://localbox:3000 and does not print nothig  until via redis-cli y push a message
[11:28] astropirate: nbari, just listen for the timeout error on the client, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/   and then make another request
[11:30] nbari: i have something like $.ajax ... error: function () {setTimeout(listen, 1000);}
[11:30] astropirate: nbari, might as well use the timeout event thats emmited by jqery
[11:30] herbySk has joined the channel
[11:31] nbari: and any idea why on the server using this: http://pastebin.com/zMyS2h0S (line 8) duplicates the messages on the console ?
[11:32] stagas: nbari: one is a favicon request. do console.log(request.url) and check it out
[11:32] nbari: oh ok let me check
[11:33] dannyamey has joined the channel
[11:33] timoxley: nbari also, that function runs EVERY time you get a request
[11:34] timoxley: nbari you probably only want to set up listeners once, not every time there's any request
[11:34] nbari: how to do that ?
[11:34] level09 has joined the channel
[11:35] timoxley: nbari that's a weird setup you have there

[11:36] nbari: I am trying to replace a nginx http_push with node.js
[11:36] nbari: by the way should I call directly node.js or use nginx like a proxy ?
[11:36] timoxley: nbari you probably want to look at socketio
[11:37] trivol has joined the channel
[11:38] ph^ has joined the channel
[11:38] nbari: how to maintaing the browser alive ?
[11:38] ningu: nbari: nginx and socket.io don't play well together
[11:38] timoxley: nbari what do you mean the browser alive?
[11:38] nbari: I would like to use only redis hredis http
[11:38] timoxley: nbari also have a look at dnode/upnode/enode
[11:38] Joeysomo has joined the channel
[11:38] ningu: so you can either not use nginx, or run socket.io on a separate port or something
[11:39] subbyyy has joined the channel
[11:39] timoxley: nbari socketio will help you.
[11:39] nbari: that script is running here: http://live.localbox.org:3000/
[11:39] timoxley: nbari why use long polling when you can push data to the server
[11:39] timoxley: sorry s/server/client
[11:40] timoxley: nbari also if you're pushing functions back to the client, dnode does all that for you
[11:40] nbari: right now my application (using long polling from nginx http_push) fetch json and based on the json modifys the user page
[11:41] nbari: but I do know know if I can avoid the long_pulling and send the modifications directly from the server to the client browser
[11:42] timoxley: nbari you can do it with dnode
[11:42] timoxley: nbari real easy
[11:42] timoxley: nbari or socketio
[11:42] nbari: i would like to avoid socketio
[11:42] timoxley: nbari why
[11:42] ningu: that's like saying you want to walk but would like to avoid using legs ;)
[11:43] timoxley: nbari what ningu  said.
[11:43] nbari: :D
[11:43] nbari: is just that currently I have this working
[11:43] ningu: I mean, there are other libraries but socket.io works the best
[11:44] nbari: I just want to keep this as simple as possible, my initial goal is just to read redis and publish all in json format so i can get proccess the reply with jquery
[11:44] nbari: and socket.io i hink is a next step
[11:44] Gloorian has joined the channel
[11:44] timoxley: nbari do not confuse simple with easy 
[11:44] Gloorian: Hello
[11:45] timoxley: nbari I'd suggest you'd be able to do it more simply with socketio
[11:45] Gloorian: Is there anyone who has an idea on how to handle time for file uploads expiration
[11:45] Gloorian: ?
[11:45] ningu: nbari: if you want to do push from node you should use socket.io
[11:45] nbari: ok
[11:45] damiano: guys, is it possible to use express.logger() setting the max number of MB of the file.log ? I would like to create something like file.log.1 file.log.2 whne the MAX Is reached
[11:45] ningu: nbari: or something build on socket.io, like dnode
[11:46] ningu: damiano: there are cron scripts for that
[11:46] nbari: dnode is https://github.com/substack/dnode ?
[11:46] ningu: or maybe winston does it for you
[11:46] ningu: nbari: yes
[11:46] timoxley: Gloorian if you have access the response, you could just do a res.end() after a certain setTimeout occurs
[11:46] Gloorian: timoxley: that's not what I meant. I made a file upload system
[11:46] timoxley: Gloorian oh
[11:47] nbari: now, what about fray ?
[11:47] timoxley: Gloorian push to S3 and use their built-in expiry?
[11:47] Gloorian: and I want to delete the files after some time without any consultation
[11:47] Gloorian: S3 ?
[11:47] Gloorian: what is it ?
[11:47] nbari: faye sorry
[11:47] damiano: ok
[11:48] timoxley: Gloorian http://aws.amazon.com/s3/
[11:48] nbari: does it make sence using long-pollign with node.js ?
[11:48] nbari: maybe I am starting wrong
[11:49] Gloorian: timoxley: If S3 is a server (page hasn't finished loading yet), well I already have a server
[11:49] timoxley: nbari it makes sense, but it's like saying you want to walk but deciding to wear clogs instead of basketball shoes
[11:49] nbari: my app is a small chat that fetchs messges using jquery ajax
[11:49] timoxley: nbari or even walking shoes.
[11:50] nbari: mmm ok
[11:51] nbari: is just that I still do not get it, I mean if currently I do the long-polling for receiving the json and later update the browser, how to achive the same from the server side with node.js ?
[11:51] `3rdEden has joined the channel
[11:51] timoxley: nbari with socketio
[11:51] timoxley: nbari sorry, you mean, an exact stand-in replacement
[11:51] Gloorian: timoxley: I thought about a setInterval of 1 day which would call a function that check wether there are files to delete or not
[11:51] nbari: if I am properly undertanding my currrent jquery will live now on the server and later just update the browser wich will not have my script ?
[11:52] timoxley: Gloorian uh, probably easier to just write a cron to do that
[11:52] Guest73099 has joined the channel
[11:52] Gloorian: a cron that would call another node.js file, that's it ?

[11:54] ningu: nbari: no, you will use socket.io on both server and client in order to pass and receive the json messages
[11:55] ningu: on the client you will define .on('foo') or whatever and in the callback do the necessary browser updates
[11:55] timoxley: ningu I think the issue is that he wants to replace his existing backend without adjusting the frontend
[11:55] nbari: mmm ok
[11:55] ningu: I see
[11:55] ningu: well, that might be hard
[11:55] timoxley: he's already got it basically
[11:56] nbari: making some tests with socket.io (the chat example) I notice that the .socket.io.js is called within the server, wondering it that scrit can be hosted in other location
[11:56] dylang has joined the channel
[11:56] lzskiss has joined the channel
[11:56] ningu: I mean, if you're going to port the backend to node you'd want to use socket.io
[11:56] timoxley: Gloorian but I'd ask yourself why you're hosting files. S3 gives you a ton of benefits. I guess it depends on how much data you're taking
[11:56] ningu: otherwise there isn't much reason to port it
[11:57] rlidwka has joined the channel
[11:57] ningu: nbari: the socket.io.js client is specific to the version of socket.io, so it's easiest to just have socket.io host it for you
[11:57] ningu: but if you want you can host it yourself wherever
[11:57] nbari: ok
[11:58] ningu: it's just a regular script tag loaded in the html
[12:00] nbari: so then socket.io is a way of avoding long-polling right ?
[12:00] trivol has joined the channel
[12:00] nbari: I mean a way the server push to the client
[12:02] skm has joined the channel
[12:03] hellp has joined the channel
[12:04] nbari: is there any reason of why should i use nginx as a proxy to node.js ?
[12:05] nbari: or by far is better to just run node.js alone on int self port ?
[12:06] timoxley: nbari nginx is probably faster for static content and it's also much more easily configured to do things like throttling
[12:07] timoxley: nbari it's pretty trivial to bypass nginx/socketio issues by simply running your node socketio stuff on a different port as ningu said before
[12:08] timoxley: nbari also if you're rebuilding some of this stuff, i'd probably consider dropping that jsonp 'callback' stuff as well
[12:09] nbari: is just that I coulnd' make it work with out the jsonp (this example: http://pastebin.com/zMyS2h0S)
[12:09] celebritarian has joined the channel
[12:12] nbari: with nginx_push I use this: jqXHR.setRequestHeader("If-None-Match", etag);

[12:13] yati has joined the channel
[12:13] nbari: i notice that with node.js there is no 'buffer' and seems that can be avoided right ?
[12:14] yati: Hi. I'm starting out with node. what's the difference between module.exports and exports? When I set the latter to a function, `require()'ing it returns an empty Object instead!
[12:16] stagas: yati: module.exports is the exported object. exports = module.exports. if you set exports to something else it no longer points to the exporting object
[12:18] phoochka has joined the channel
[12:18] yati: stagas,  Wow! thanks :) Okay, I'm reading Mastering Node - would you suggest something else? I'm new to Node, but not to programming.
[12:19] nbari: i removed all the jsonp and the callback stuff but here is the code: http://pastebin.com/hQAaxyEp
[12:20] nbari: but what I still do not undestand, is why on the console on the server where I run node myscript.js. everytime that I receive a message the log is incremented x 2
[12:21] nbari: at a poing that I get something like this: (node) warning: possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 11 listeners added. Use emitter.setMaxListeners() to increase limit.
[12:22] ningu: nbari: you don't want to add the callback for every request
[12:22] ningu: just add it once at the beginning
[12:22] nbari: how ?
[12:22] stagas: yati: the node docs is a good start, do you know js?
[12:22] enmand has joined the channel
[12:24] nbari: ningu: sorry but I do not undestand, I mean on the server script how to avoid adding the callback for every request, and how to print on every request the 'messages' in case there are some ?
[12:24] yati: stagas, Yes, but just as much as I need to use in typical front-end tasks - But I hear JS is much more capable than that with closures and all. 
[12:24] hackband has joined the channel
[12:25] stagas: yati: http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/ is nice if you already know some js
[12:25] epokmedia has joined the channel
[12:25] ningu: nbari: call client.on() before you create the server
[12:25] baudehlo has joined the channel
[12:26] ningu: nbari: I don't really know what you are trying to do but it won't work unless you understand node's async control flow
[12:26] nbari: I want to just read  redis db and publish the results on web
[12:26] nbari: no more
[12:27] nbari: using redis-cli I am using sometingl like publish pubsub  test
[12:27] nbari: and on the browser I have a $.ajax script doing a long-polling
[12:27] yati: stagas, thanks :D Exactly what I needed :) . Specific to Node, is Mastering Node good?
[12:28] ningu: nbari: ok, so that means you don't need your server to do much at all -- in fact, all you need is to have socket.io listen on port 3000
[12:28] maritz has joined the channel
[12:28] ningu: well, I suppose you need to host the js that the client will use, too
[12:28] level09 has joined the channel
[12:29] nbari: that's why I initially say that I would like to avoid first socket.io since for this small test I allready got it running
[12:30] ningu: ok, but you can't do push without socket.io
[12:30] nbari: but now I just want to fix this or improveit so later I can learn more about 'socket.io'
[12:30] ningu: if you don't want push then you don't need it
[12:30] nbari: no, i do not need push
[12:30] stagas: yati: haven't read it. there's also howtonode and you'll find lots of tutorials in the internet
[12:31] ningu: oh, well then don't worry about socket.io -- just have client.on('message',...) store the messages in an array or something, and each request checks if the array has anything, returns it, and clears the array
[12:31] nbari: as said, currently I only want to subscribe to a redisdb and to print the jsonoutput on the browser, no more but on the browser I have a script that does the $.ajas request
[12:31] yati: stagas, ok fine. thanks :)
[12:31] ningu: I suppose that code would have to be carefully written to avoid race conditions
[12:31] nbari: exaclty
[12:32] nbari: in fact I am trying to learn, how to create or store the values on an array, and in each request return the values in case there are any
[12:32] mehlah has joined the channel

[12:33] tisba has joined the channel
[12:33] ningu: long polling is only useful for server push, though, which you just said you didn't need
[12:33] nbari: specially the last example, but I don't know how to addapt it with the 4 lines of redis
[12:35] nbari: sorry I am mixing things
[12:35] nbari: could you please help me undertand/fix my fist example
[12:35] nbari: my objective is only to print on every request the redis messages
[12:35] ningu: not if I don't know what you are trying to do
[12:36] ningu: well, what's wrong with the way I suggested?
[12:36] tisba has joined the channel

[12:40] megalomix: if i have app.js in /www/first
[12:40] ningu: you don't subscribe within the callback
[12:40] megalomix: can i do require('../second/test')
[12:40] megalomix: ?
[12:40] ningu: the callback is what's triggered when someone sends a message that you've subscribed to
[12:40] nbari: sorry i pasted the wrong code i ovelap the lines
[12:41] ningu: and then you need to save the message somewhere in a global
[12:41] ningu: and check for it in the requests

[12:43] pgte has joined the channel
[12:43] ningu: anyway it should be an array

[12:43] Maxani has joined the channel
[12:44] TheJH has joined the channel
[12:46] nbari: mmm
[12:47] nbari: the global could be var messages= []; and on client.on("message", function(channel, message){ messages.push(message);}
[12:47] nbari: ?
[12:48] nbari: so if I am right taht will increment the array messages with all message from the redis, right ?
[12:49] Wizek has joined the channel
[12:49] ningu: yes
[12:50] nbari: I now this are very basics but how to later retun that within the response.end ( ) ?
[12:50] ningu: it's just a global variable, what's the issue?
[12:52] nbari: I have now this: http://pastebin.com/ZVrmJMjS but when after open the site i get this:  TypeError('first argument must be a string or Buffer');
[12:52] aspecto has joined the channel
[12:54] ningu: well, yes, the response can't be an array
[12:54] ningu: but I don't know how you want to return the messages
[12:54] nbari: I just would like to print it
[12:54] ningu: ok, but if there is more than one message how will you do that?
[12:55] nbari: maybe a serlialize
[12:55] ningu: oh, you are returning json
[12:55] nbari: could it be ?
[12:55] ningu: well, you set the content-type to json
[12:55] ningu: which you shouldn't do unless you are returning json :P
[12:55] nbari: done already
[12:56] nbari: I have this line: response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "application/json; charset=UTF-8", Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*" })
[12:56] ningu: I know
[12:56] ningu: so if you want to turn the array into a json string you use JSON.stringify
[12:58] nbari: ok  got it working and know start to undertand better, now after this change, the browser enteres into a loop
[12:58] nbari: if I am right I can start making a contions inside http, if messages are empty, do not send nothing else send
[13:00] ningu: sure

[13:04] nbari: I created the array var messages = []; but after running the node script it will be filled with the redis posted on redis
[13:04] nbari: how to only keep the last messages
[13:05] nbari: otherwise my browser keeps printing all the array
[13:05] nbari: I tryied on the http something like if (messages.length) but seems not to be working
[13:05] ningu: nbari: I think you should be able to figure this one out on your own
[13:06] nbari: ok, If I am just undestanding node scripts area infinite loop
[13:06] tuhoojabotti: event loop
[13:06] nbari: and do X actions based on certains conditions
[13:06] tuhoojabotti: not infinite loop
[13:06] nbari: events

[13:21] ningu: aha
[13:21] benvie: node's DataView shows the indexes as Uint8 and that's not changeable, but there's no supposed to be any indexes showing actually
[13:21] ningu: didn't realize it was a js feature, not node
[13:22] benvie: like in Chrome you won't see any indexes
[13:22] benvie: so it's basically like a Uint8Array + DataView in node 
[13:23] benvie: so ViewBuffer uses a DataView underneath to do the reading and writing of the various types without having to make a bunch of different Typed Arrays

[17:24] papple has left the channel
[17:25] Sonny: 0.2.19
[17:25] TooTallNate: ok
[17:25] TooTallNate: that is
[17:25] TooTallNate: ANCIENT
[17:25] TooTallNate: hahaha
[17:25] Sonny: haha
[17:25] Sonny: ok i'll try to update that
[17:25] TooTallNate: that's why package mangers + node are no good
[17:25] TooTallNate: (other than npm itself :p)
[17:26] TooTallNate: Sonny: 1) uninstall the npm from apt-get 2) follow the instructions at npmjs.org
[17:26] TooTallNate: Sonny: probably would be good thing to ask what `node -v` says as well...
[17:26] Sonny: haha ok
[17:26] Sonny: v0.4.9
[17:26] TooTallNate: aye caramba
[17:27] TooTallNate: the latest stable version is v0.6.13
[17:27] Sonny: that's the lesson to not to use apt-get very often
[17:27] TooTallNate: so again, rather ancient
[17:27] TooTallNate: apt-get is ok, but best for stable software
[17:27] TooTallNate: node is still newish, and development moves fast
[17:27] Sonny: ok then from beggining because im total noob how to uninstall npm

[17:28] TooTallNate: RLa: i wouldn't know, but not that i know of
[17:28] RLa: TooTallNate, with ruby gems that has caused a lot of trouble
[17:28] ningu: seems like a bad idea since a lot of things mix module versions
[17:28] Sonny: tnx
[17:29] RLa: so i really hope they do not start packaging node modules as native packages
[17:29] TooTallNate: i don't think anyone is looking into that; npm is the "blessed" packager at this point
[17:29] ningu: I think npm does it right basically -- it would only be annoying if you had like 50 or 100 top-level modules for your app
[17:29] ningu: well, by annoying I mean slow :)
[17:30] TooTallNate: when it comes to deployment-time i like to eliminate npm from the equation
[17:30] Brian` has joined the channel
[17:30] TooTallNate: i.e. commit node_modules to the repo, or just use a tarball
[17:30] ningu: there are different views on that
[17:30] ironbridge: Hi all.  Does anyone know if there is a way to increase the node http post body size?  I'm getting an error that ells me that my limit is 8k. 
[17:30] ningu: I specify the versions in package.json and let npm install them
[17:30] RLa: maybe not fedora people, i have heard they have very strict policy of distributing any part that looks like library as a library through rpm
[17:30] TooTallNate: ningu: sure, but there's still an uncertainty level
[17:31] TooTallNate: ningu: that's why `npm shrinkwrap` was created
[17:32] TooTallNate: RLa: but no fedora person is gonna manually go through all the packages in npm, port them to rms, it's just impossible
[17:32] TooTallNate: s/rms/rpms

[18:01] TooTallNate: Brandon_R: are you running the vcbuild.bat?
[18:01] westg: arguments.callee?
[18:01] Brandon_R: yeah from the visual studio cmd line

[18:02] Octayn: *context
[18:02] Octayn: `this`?
[18:02] RLa: i think it drops .callee and stuff
[18:03] Brandon_R: gonna go install 2.9 thanks for the heads up
[18:03] TooTallNate: sure np
[18:03] Octayn: Brandon_R: there is no 2.9
[18:03] Octayn: 2.7 is the last of the python 2 series
[18:03] RLa: 'this' is just a pointer which you can bind to next function or pass as argument
[18:03] Brandon_R: 2.7
[18:03] TooTallNate: http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.2/
[18:05] Brandon_R: can i install it side by side with 3.2 or do i need to uninstall 3.2?
[18:05] TooTallNate: i think side-by-side is fine
[18:05] Octayn: they can coexist.
[18:05] yawNO: you can have both
[18:05] Brandon_R: thanks

[18:38] brianleroux has joined the channel

[18:41] Sonny: ubuntu 11.10
[18:41] WarheadsSE: gist or pastie/pastebin ..
[18:41] ningu: I manage my node install with nvm
[18:41] WarheadsSE: are you doing this as sudo/su ?
[18:41] ningu: but building from source like that works perfectly well too
[18:42] Sonny: https://gist.github.com/2198948

[18:47] WarheadsSE: if you want to program, you're going to have to .. program
[18:47] RLa: you can do programs without writing code yourself, just drag pieces together
[18:47] Octayn: Qalqi: Linux isn't a programming language, or a programming environment..
[18:47] warz: or, become a superstar like kevin rose and people will give you money to watch other people code cool apps
[18:47] systemfault: Linux is five letters!

[18:48] warz: He wants an application that he can easily tinker with, without knowing too much about javascript.
[18:48] ningu: Qalqi: what are you trying to accomplish?
[18:48] warz: Why is that hard to understand
[18:49] ningu: there is a serious limit to how much tinkering you can do without coding
[18:49] Octayn: Go tinker with firefox then
[18:49] warz: He asked for nodejs
[18:49] ParadoxQuine: waterbear is programming, it's just visual programming. same kind of thing, just simpler. seems like what he wants

[18:50] ParadoxQuine: also...why don't you want to code? Just curious
[18:50] Sonny: i'm having problem with make install
[18:51] Sonny: but it says that it's Read-only file system
[18:51] Octayn: Sonny: try and make a symlink
[18:51] Sonny: symlink?
[18:51] Octayn: Yes, a symlink.
[18:51] WarheadsSE: ln -s old new
[18:51] ningu: Sonny: why is /usr/local read-only? what kind of ubuntu install is this?
[18:51] Sonny: it's clean ubuntu 11.10
[18:52] RLa: hm, waterbear seems quite interesting but its graphics could look better and more concise
[18:52] ningu: Sonny: but is it a boot cd or what?
[18:52] Sonny: it's iso cd
[18:52] WarheadsSE: !doh
[18:52] ningu: you can't install things on a cd
[18:52] Octayn: Sonny's error is when the build tries to link out/Release/node to ./node
[18:52] dgathright has joined the channel
[18:52] Sonny: it's installed on disc okay?
[18:53] WarheadsSE: So, then you have it installed to a disk in the virtual machine

[18:54] Sonny: i'll try to reboot

[18:55] Octayn: The issue isn't with /usr/local, it's with making a symlink in the working dir
[18:55] Octayn: Sonny: did you try making a symlink yet?
[18:56] WarheadsSE: eg `ln -s README README.link`
[18:56] Sonny: Octayn: dunno how to

[18:56] Octayn: what WarheadsSE said
[18:56] crescendo_ has joined the channel
[18:56] Sonny: i'm tring to think how this works
[18:56] Sonny: instead readme i need to write folder name?

[18:56] WarheadsSE: we're just trying to make a link
[18:57] TooTallNate: well duh creating a symlink on a windows drive isn't gonna work!!

[18:57] TooTallNate: wow, bingo

[19:00] TooTallNate: Brandon_R: hahaha, gyp is a little steep at first but it grows on you i think
[19:00] Brandon_R: gyp is cool
[19:00] WarheadsSE: and you can make symlinks in windows (of sufficiently new release) but they arent posix compliant
[19:00] TooTallNate: Brandon_R: anyways, come to me with gyp questions in the future if you get 'em

[19:04] Brandon_R: TooTallnNate: thanks for all your help bro

[19:05] Brandon_R: TooTallnNate: finally got it to work :P
[19:05] Marak: WarheadsSE: that would totally work, have you seen the stackvm thing?
[19:05] WarheadsSE: it's turn based, but it's best to be somewhat realtime

[20:11] WarheadsSE: I've got a non-distributed package that builds v8, then openssl, then nodejs

[20:12] WarheadsSE: those are dependant really
[20:13] TooTallNate: that's the point of the configure scipts
[20:13] TooTallNate: script
[20:13] WarheadsSE: setting vfp type, and floatabi settings
[20:13] TooTallNate: it detects stuff
[20:13] AdamGoodrich has joined the channel

[20:14] nathan28 has joined the channel
[20:15] WarheadsSE: the trick TooTallNate is that way float eabi is set: soft, softfloat, hard
[20:15] benvie: so the main thing
[20:15] TooTallNate: still, could you gist your build process?
[20:15] benvie: I cannot get any of the keybinds going

[20:15] TooTallNate: i wanna make this as smooth as building on the other archs
[20:15] benvie: visually it's fine but
[20:15] benvie: and I can write code, and press enter, and it works
[20:15] benvie: but no meta keys of any kind
[20:15] TooTallNate: benvie: i think it's cause you're only getting "data" events on "enter"
[20:16] benvie: yeah
[20:16] TooTallNate: that's the difference between "line-buffered" and "raw"
[20:16] benvie: there's no keypress
[20:16] benvie: oh
[20:16] benvie: damn it
[20:16] TooTallNate: benvie: "raw" you would be getting "data" on literally every ketpress
[20:16] TooTallNate: keypress
[20:16] benvie: well I have listeners for both data and keypress
[20:17] TooTallNate: WarheadsSE: and was all this with the 0.6 branch ./configure-gyp script or with master?
[20:17] WarheadsSE: master
[20:17] WarheadsSE: so ~ 0.8+
[20:17] TooTallNate: benvie: i don't know if there is a way to make mintty be in raw mode
[20:17] TooTallNate: benvie: but the bash in mintty has tab completion somehow...
[20:18] TooTallNate: benvie: maybe we'd have to look at mintty's source and see how it's bash does it
[20:18] TooTallNate: benvie: but it seems like something non-standard
[20:18] benvie: I think there's just some key thing I'm missing here because it's so close to working right
[20:18] benvie: like some of the key stuff works
[20:18] TooTallNate: benvie: or maybe you just call "setRawMode()" on the fd even though it reports false for isatty()
[20:19] benvie: can you do like
[20:19] benvie: setRawMode.call(fd) or something?
[20:19] benvie: tty.setRawMode

[20:27] alm0nd: i'm working on a simple image upload form using expressjs, when validating filetypes should I check the type value or the mime value?
[20:27] bingomanatee: hello - little help - can't get canvas installed on OSX - https://gist.github.com/9e24d0550bce6a0c0723#comments
[20:28] bingomanatee: check for what purpose almond?
[20:29] alm0nd: to ensure its an image and not something malicious, user selected wrong file etc
[20:29] adrianF has joined the channel
[20:30] bingomanatee: mime type … but the safest thing is to ensure it is not saved with an executable perimsssion.

[20:50] RLa: why not to add whole php parser too :)
[20:50] bingomanatee: TooTallNate: when you type "which cairo" should you expect to get a result?
[20:50] TheEmpath: RLa: because php is blocking.  this is nonblocking
[20:50] TheEmpath: RLa: And it allows you to write native JS to be processed without weird markup alternatives.,
[20:50] TheEmpath: ACTION stares at Jade.
[20:50] TooTallNate: bingomanatee: nope
[20:51] RLa: i'm not quite fond of putting code in templates but lot of people (php-ones) might like it

[20:54] Transformer has left the channel
[20:54] yawNO: i think it's because i deeply detest the way php interacts with html
[20:54] TheEmpath: BUT if you could detect your environment and, based on that, server either the whole js files or the minified ones.. now oyu can develop much faster
[20:55] TheEmpath: esp when dealing with things like backbone.js
[20:55] TheEmpath: utlimately, this is not meant ot be run per page request... i have a caching mechanism that assemlbes html pages aggressively
[20:55] TheEmpath: i wouldn't recommend running this on each page request, obviously

[21:00] benvie: so my gathering from this was
[21:00] benvie: windows is a piece of asshole shit
[21:00] TooTallNate: benvie: this is a rather interesting problem. i'd like to hear bert's opinion on it
[21:00] benvie: when it comes to consoles
[21:00] TheEmpath: my understanding is that function calls are sent to a thread pool
[21:00] TheEmpath: even if i loop through, because i am dispatching functions per iteration, the loop will finish, then the thread pool will process
[21:00] benvie: the last time I saw him discussing it he was holfing the line on "not possible"
[21:00] TooTallNate: benvie: at the end they basically figure it out i think
[21:00] TheEmpath: ACTION may fundamentally misundestand node.
[21:01] TooTallNate: setvbuf(stdin, 0, _IONBF, BUFSIZ);
[21:01] benvie: oh maybe this is a different thread
[21:01] TooTallNate: ^ apparently works whether stdin is a console or a pipe
[21:01] benvie: oh my
[21:04] benvie: ok so
[21:04] TooTallNate: benvie: so maybe the "-i" flag should instead force the tty.ReadStream logic
[21:04] TooTallNate: might blow shit up
[21:05] benvie: I'm going to see if I can find the spot where this is in libuv
[21:05] benvie: and do some tests
[21:05] TooTallNate: uggh, this isnt what is should be focusing on right now
[21:05] benvie: but if it works that at LEAST be a way to turn it on optionally
[21:05] benvie: haha but this is fun stuff =D
[21:05] TooTallNate: benvie: look into uv_tty_set_mode() i think
[21:05] benvie: what should you be? ttys are way more important than work
[21:05] TooTallNate: book man, book
[21:06] benvie: who needs books we have the internet

[21:08] skum has joined the channel
[21:08] TooTallNate: piscisaureus_: what are your thoughts on mintty?
[21:08] TheEmpath: yawNO: Yeah, that's the theory.  When I start the server, I load everything into cache as raw, gzip, and deflate, but first, I run the preprocesor on everything.
[21:09] TheEmpath: That way, I only run the preprocessor once during production.
[21:09] yawNO: also cache your regexes

[21:11] benvie: yeah hah
[21:11] TooTallNate: libuv doesn't use it on the Windows side at leadt
[21:11] TooTallNate: least
[21:11] benvie: indeed
[21:12] benvie: but this is it
[21:12] benvie: trying to think
[21:12] subbyyy has joined the channel
[21:12] benvie: could be done with a module but it has to be a fresh file handle so it can't be like upgrading some existing handle
[21:12] TooTallNate: benvie: actually probably open an issue on libuv
[21:12] michaelhartau has joined the channel
[21:13] benvie: cause we don't need amazing super duper efficiency for this one specific application
[21:13] benvie: it just needs to work
[21:13] TooTallNate: libuv + tty pipe + mintty (pipes, not console) = ???
[21:13] benvie: yeah basically that option, it's more than that though
[21:13] benvie: it's -i for windows
[21:13] redir has joined the channel
[21:13] benvie: it's not possible otherwise
[21:14] benvie: or so it would seem
[21:14] TheEmpath: yawNO: On a side note, I was able to reproduce PHP in under 100 lines with Node.js so that's gotta be lulzy :D
[21:14] TooTallNate: right, mintty will always get the autodetection wrong
[21:14] TooTallNate: but the functionality should be there
[21:14] TooTallNate: with the -i flag
[21:14] benvie: well I think it was more than that
[21:14] benvie: it's windows itself
[21:14] benvie: mintty blames the applications
[21:14] benvie: but reading through this it just seems
[21:15] TooTallNate: but as far as libuv goes, it should be possible to write a small program that listens for *every* keypress and prints something
[21:15] benvie: you have to go for the full unbuffered using this because the only other options is full buffering
[21:15] benvie: you mean like outside the console api?
[21:15] benvie: yeah
[21:15] benvie: I was thinking of doing that with ffi
[21:16] ohtogo has joined the channel
[21:16] mattgifford has joined the channel
[21:16] benvie: it's possible to go outside the console api and hook in at a higher level you just have to filter all the extra stuff out and try to make sense from it 
[21:16] TooTallNate: benvie: basically what you need is a way to force a uv_tty_stream, on either a real console, or a "pipe"
[21:16] benvie: which I will do if I have to

[21:35] enjalot has joined the channel
[21:36] TooTallNate: benvie: ok so basically the problem is that the -i flag i added isn't comprehensive enough
[21:37] TooTallNate: ideally, it would pass a flag to libuv that would force stdin to be a tty_stream rather than a pipe_steam
[21:37] Renegade001 has joined the channel
[21:38] benvie: yeah
[21:38] TooTallNate: it would do that by doing the AllocConsole() and all that jazz

[21:38] TooTallNate: s/be/me
[21:38] benvie: yeah looking through code now and the thing is that it kind of needs to hook in right at the beginning
[21:38] TooTallNate: yup

[21:47] mandric has joined the channel
[21:47] TooTallNate: bnoordhuis: basically, libuv needs a way to force creating a tty_stream

[21:47] bnoordhuis: TooTallNate: why / when?
[21:47] cmwelsh has joined the channel
[21:47] polardude: I've looked at Passport… but I'm more interested in a good simple username/password in a package without the need for authentication towards popular web apps
[21:47] benvie: -i made doesn't work on windows because stdin is fully buffered
[21:47] TooTallNate: bnoordhuis: mintty uses "pipes" and there's no way to actually make isatty() report true in it
[21:47] polardude: that interfaces with Express and MongoDB
[21:48] _th_n has joined the channel
[21:48] TooTallNate: bnoordhuis: as a result, the "-i" flag i added to node is only partially useful
[21:48] willwhite has joined the channel
[21:48] TooTallNate: since, as benvie said, there's no way to force unbuffered mode
[21:48] benvie: there's nothing between unbuffered and fully buffered
[21:49] bnoordhuis: TooTallNate: why would you want to pretend that stdin/out is a tty when it's not?
[21:49] bnoordhuis: or am i misunderstanding something here?
[21:49] TooTallNate: bnoordhuis: cause windows is broken :\
[21:49] benvie: in windows it's only ever considered a tty when you're literally sitting in cmd.exe
[21:49] TooTallNate: bnoordhuis: it's basically for mintty, which doesn't act like programs are running inside a tty
[21:49] ningu: benvie: whoa, you can be literally sitting in cmd.exe?
[21:49] bnoordhuis: right
[21:49] benvie: I dfo
[21:49] freedomcaller has joined the channel
[21:50] bnoordhuis: you guys should probably take this up with piscisaureus_
[21:50] ningu: how does windows even have ttys?
[21:50] TooTallNate: bnoordhuis: ya i kno, he's MIA
[21:50] benvie: windows has a console, and other applicationd exists
[21:50] freedomcaller: so im writing a simple game which ends when somone triggers the end or a settimeout reaches its end, but i cant seem to cancel the set timeout if somone triggers the end
[21:50] ningu: benvie: yeah, but none of the posix apis, right?
[21:50] benvie: and it has an impact on other things
[21:50] TooTallNate: bnoordhuis: but for comparison, python's "-i" flag does something similar
[21:51] benvie: subshells like when you're building stuff
[21:51] benvie: you just need to get it into unbuffered mode so you can just do it yourself
[21:51] benvie: and then you can do whatever you need to do
[21:52] benvie: but to do that requires buy in front, you have to do it before doing anything with stdin/stdout
[21:52] bnoordhuis: TooTallNate: shouldn't be too hard to add but... take it up with piscisaureus_ first :)
