[00:02] wafflesburger: since node is so xperimental
[00:02] Viriix: but there orders of magnitude different in terms of deployment

[05:13] Tobsn: they suggested a different lib
[05:13] Tobsn: i tried libxmljs a couple days ago
[05:13] Tobsn: and it works just fine
[05:13] Tobsn: xml2js
[05:13] Tobsn: npm install xml2js
[05:13] Tobsn: works fine.
[05:14] Tobsn: they also suggested this here:
[05:14] Tobsn: https://gist.github.com/416021
[05:14] Tobsn: now go and fix up your code ;)
[05:14] Tobsn: just that you know: its not you, its the node-rss lib which is broken
[05:14] nickhac: ohh cool
[05:15] nickhac: yeah ill try xml2JS
[05:16] mscdex: heh
[05:16] mscdex: that one requires libxmljs, but you can also probably use isaac's pure-js xml parser too
[05:16] mscdex: just need to tweak the code a bit
[05:16] Tobsn: there should be a "report broken code" button on github
[05:16] mscdex: Tobsn: it's called the issue queue ;)
[05:17] Tobsn: nah i mean something more drastic
[05:17] Tobsn: like if x amount of people report it broken
[05:17] Tobsn: and after 2 weeks of no change there should be a mozilla style safebrowsing warning
[05:17] Tobsn: "THIS CODE IS FUUUUUUUCKED."

[05:24] secoif_: Am I correct when I say: "To install commandline executables with npm, eg jslint, i must install them with 'npm install -g module' "
[05:24] secoif_: as of npm 1.x
[05:25] gkatsev: yes
[05:25] Tobsn: pretty much
[05:25] Tobsn: i put the -g always at the end :P
[05:25] gkatsev: but you need to set the correct PATH too...
[05:26] gkatsev: tbranyen: did you ever bug isaacs about having npm set the paths correctly upon first npm install -g?
[05:26] secoif: or can I add something to my path so I can use the ones install ed in my $HOME/node_modules folder
[05:26] Tobsn: oh yeah, dont forget to mention in very big letters (VERY BIG AND RED) that the paths need to be set correctly
[05:26] secoif: yeah I can use everything set using -g
[05:26] blkcat: hm, does mongoose still cast hex strings to objectids in findById?
[05:26] secoif: but i was wondering what the go is with anything not global
[05:26] secoif: it seems like a silly decision
[05:26] Tobsn: not global is always home or inside exec path
[05:27] Tobsn: man i wish isaacs would be here right now
[05:27] Tobsn: secoif, there is a project for that
[05:27] Tobsn: https://github.com/tobsn/gpm
[05:27] secoif: if I install jslint without -g it won't be available on $PATH
[05:28] secoif: couldn't gpm, be achieved with a simple alias?
[05:28] secoif: or a script
[05:28] secoif: rather than a whole fork of npm?
[05:28] Tobsn: secoif, that fork was a joke ;)
[05:28] secoif: it seems like elephant to kill a gnat?
[05:28] gkatsev: Tobsn: is gpm just npm that does npm install -g for you all the time?
[05:28] secoif: oh
[05:28] secoif: hah
[05:28] secoif: ok it's funny
[05:28] Tobsn: gkatsev, its a joke, cause isaacs always arguments that -g is the way to go instead of -l
[05:29] gkatsev: heh
[05:29] gkatsev: ok
[05:29] secoif: silly isaacs
[05:29] Tobsn: but 99% of the people expect the other way around
[05:29] secoif: the worst thing about it is it breaks a bunch o node tutorials
[05:29] Tobsn: even if his approach makes more sense in the long run
[05:29] gkatsev: Tobsn: you need another fork that would install it in a random place every time and requires either a -g or -l for a sane location.
[05:29] secoif: ha
[05:30] Tobsn: oh yeah, that would even be funnier... just index the whole accessable directory struct and pick a random directory
[05:30] Tobsn: ;)
[05:30] secoif: lol
[05:30] Tobsn: correctly installed in: /var/lib/mongodb/data/node_modules/
[05:30] Tobsn: ;)
[05:30] gkatsev: haha
[05:30] gkatsev: yes
[05:31] gkatsev: do it
[05:31] gkatsev: apm
[05:31] gkatsev: anywhere npm
[05:31] gkatsev: or maybe rpm
[05:31] gkatsev: random npm
[05:31] Tobsn: and to avoid that you have to specify -g or -l or it just choses random
[05:31] gkatsev: not to be confused with rpm

[06:07] mscdex: hever: i tried your example earlier, i get at most 2% cpu usage
[06:07] mscdex: hever: what version of node are you using?
[06:07] Aria: Better: If a package has things that look like they should end up in your path, throw a warning suggesting installing globally.
[06:07] ralphholzmann: Heyo -- any idea on how to find out the encoding of a buffer?
[06:07] hever: mscdex, v0.4.7
[06:08] mscdex: ralphholzmann: a Buffer has no encoding
[06:08] ralphholzmann: I have a buffer that could be utf8 or base64
[06:08] Aria: ralphholzmann: Sure. It's "an array of bytes".
[06:08] mscdex: it's just raw bytes
[06:08] mscdex: yeah
[06:08] mscdex: heh
[06:08] ralphholzmann: alrighty
[06:08] ralphholzmann: thanks! :)
[06:08] hever: Aria, how could I invoke more?
[06:08] mscdex: hever: hmmm, i'm on 0.4.8, but dunno if it matters or not
[06:08] secoif: Aria: now there's a good idea
[06:08] Aria: hever: I'm not entirely sure what the problem is there -- it looks like it should run well, though you really just want 200 connections?
[06:09] secoif: pedro is going to have to rewrite the whole npm section in his node book 
[06:09] secoif: or
[06:09] secoif: well
[06:09] secoif: add a few lines explaining
[06:09] secoif: -g -l
[06:10] hever: Aria, the maximum in the loop doesn't matter. I can double it and it takes just longer with the same utilization.
[06:10] Aria: Are you thinking that utilization is high or low?
[06:11] hever: mscdex, But should node use my system as good as possible?
[06:11] hever: Aria, way to low
[06:11] Aria: You expect some mere http requests to spin your CPU?
[06:11] hever: Aria, my system could do much more...
[06:11] mscdex: hever: maybe up your max sockets number
[06:11] mscdex: for http.Agent
[06:11] fangel has joined the channel
[06:12] hever: Or is the problem that google answers not engough requests ? (Like MaxRequestsPerClient )
[06:12] hever: Aria, yes
[06:12] kohai: @aredridel: @cloudhead Thanks for #vows. Makes testing in #nodejs much more awesome.
[06:12] Aria: 40% seems unreasonably high to me.
[06:12] hever: mscdex, is this a node setting?
[06:12] Aria: It's network-bound, not CPU-bound.
[06:13] Aria: Though yeah, http will limit to a few connections at a time by default.
[06:14] LowValueTarget has joined the channel
[06:14] Aria: You can set http.Agent.defaultMaxSockets = somebiggernumber
[06:15] skm has joined the channel
[06:15] mscdex has joined the channel
[06:16] Aria: But in any case, I get much lower CPU numbers than that -- there's just no reason that sending a thousand or so packets needs to spin the CPU.
[06:16] hever: Aria, ok thanks I did this with no effect.
[06:16] Aria: Node doesn't busy-wait.
[06:17] ralphholzmann: if I'm subscribing to an event that pumps file data to it
[06:17] ralphholzmann: is it cool if I just collect all the buffers in an array
[06:17] Aria: How fast do you expect data to come in?
[06:17] ralphholzmann: and then do new Buffer( <array of small bufs>.join('') ) ?
[06:17] hever: I've two cores one goes from 10% to 50% and one from 10% to ~20%.
[06:17] Aria: ralphholzmann: Sure. Though that may well be inefficient use of RAM.
[06:18] hever: Let me monitor it witha network monitor...
[06:18] Aria: Hm. That seems high. How fast a core are you talking about?
[06:18] Aria: Slow ARMs might look like that with that test...
[06:18] Aria: My Macbook Air doesn't even notice it on the CPU.
[06:19] hever: It's a core2 duo somewhat.
[06:19] Aria: Huh. That seems rather high then.
[06:19] Aria: How are you measuring the CPU use?
[06:19] chjj: ralphholzmann, you cant just concatenate buffers that easily, ideally you should be holding a bunch of buffers in memory anyway
[06:20] chjj: shouldnt be**
[06:20] hever: Aria, product: Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     T9900  @ 3.06GHz
[06:20] Aria: Yow. Fast CPUs!
[06:20] hever: Aria, I'm just looking at the Gnome system monitor.

[06:22] secoif: in front of the global bin folder
[06:22] Aria: That's an option. My global goes to /usr/local/bin/, so it works already for me.
[06:22] ralphholzmann: chjj: I'm subscribing to an "email attachment data" event in Hakara
[06:22] ralphholzmann: where it pumps in parts of file attachments
[06:22] ralphholzmann: as buffers
[06:23] ralphholzmann: and I need to concatenate the buffers into a single buffer to rebuild the attachment
[06:24] hever: Aria, what node version are you using, how do you measure the load?
[06:24] Aria: using "top" to look at processes using the CPU, node 0.4.8.
[06:24] Aria: my node process doesn't even register. 
[06:25] Aria: Since it's network bound.
[06:25] chjj: ralphholzmann: concatenating them is kind of akward, youre essentially concatenation a bunch of c char arrays
[06:25] chjj: concatenating*
[06:25] ralphholzmann: chjj: i know :( how do you suggest I handle it?
[06:25] zeedre: secoif, I think I
[06:26] seivan has joined the channel
[06:26] zeedre: 'm having th esame problem. So, you removed and reinstalled with -g and now you can call the module directlly?
[06:27] chjj: ralphholzmann: ideally you shouldnt have to do it, because youre holding a ton of data in memory, and when you create the new buffer to copy all the small ones onto, youre doubling your memory usage
[06:28] hever: Aria, hmm with htop node just gets 1% ;) X is going to 70%...
[06:28] chjj: ralphholzmann: but you have to create a new buffer with a size of the total of all the smaller buffers' sizes
[06:29] chjj: ralphholzmann: and then copy all the small buffers onto the big one
[06:29] zeedre: I'll answer my question with a yes. Inded there is now some broken tuts.
[06:29] chjj: ralphholzmann: what would you be doing with these buffers though? why do you need to do this?
[06:29] Aria: Aha! So definitely don't trust Gnome there. It's not fine enough grained -- something dumping tons of data to a terminal?
[06:29] hever: Aria, if I remove the console output everything is fine ;)
[06:29] ralphholzmann: chjj: I run an email to dropbox service
[06:29] ralphholzmann: called sendtodropbox.com
[06:29] Aria: Hehe. Well then!
[06:29] secoif: zeedre: yep
[06:30] ralphholzmann: its currently on a crappy lamp stack with cron jobs
[06:30] ralphholzmann: and I'm working on porting it over to node
[06:30] chjj: ralphholzmann: if its a file it would probably be smarter to pipe the incoming data to a file write stream, and then you would have it as a temporary file
[06:30] ralphholzmann: so I'll be taking the attachments and sending them over to a user's dropbox via oauth
[06:30] chjj: ralphholzmann: and then you wouldnt be holding it all in memory
[06:30] ralphholzmann: chjj: thats a good suggestion
[06:31] Aria: Or pass it through live.
[06:31] Aria: Write  to dropbox as the email comes in.
[06:31] Aria: And don't actually /store/ it inbetween.
[06:31] truedat101 has joined the channel
[06:31] chjj: yeah, or pipe it elsewhere
[06:32] chjj: but if you need to hold it somewhere, the filesystem is the best place for it, it doesnt belong in memory
[06:32] ralphholzmann: kk, thank you for your help chjj and Aria
[06:32] ralphholzmann: much appreciated! =)
[06:32] chjj: var name = '/tmp/' + Date.now(); readStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(name));
[06:32] Aria: Sure thing.
[06:32] chjj: and then you have a path to your temporary file

[06:35] secoif: see if it's  that causing the issue
[06:36] blkcat: no dice. :(
[06:36] secoif: blkcat: on second looks, looks like some kind of recursion

[06:37] hever: Aria, mscdex ok thank you! The CPU load came from X that had to render the console output and I think the netload is limited to the max amount of requests google answers. I could double the netload by invoking two requests per iteration.

[06:37] Aria: Actually you couldn't. That loop terminates really fast.
[06:38] secoif: blkcat: perhaps it thinks commission[id] is an array
[06:38] blkcat: grrr.
[06:38] Aria: The requests are all queued, answered when Google does.
[06:38] Aria: So two requests per iteration won
[06:38] blkcat: secoif: maybe, but that partial includes other inputs in the same general format
[06:38] Aria: 't do any different than twice as many iterations.
[06:38] hever: Aria, I meant requesting google and yahoo ;) I tried it ;)
[06:39] secoif: hrm

[06:39] blkcat: v. strange
[06:39] Aria: (hence BitTorrent ;-))
[06:40] hever: Ok great, then really google is the limit (per IP) and node is really fast ;)
[06:40] secoif:  Maximum call stack size exceeded is usually recursion, what happens if you pull out the partial
[06:40] secoif: blkcat: 
[06:41] blkcat: secoif: i've tried it all - the only thing that fixes it is removing the commission[id] element

[10:32] nickhac: Hey guys, any tips on trying to use node.io to get all the img src's
[10:32] nickhac: to get all <a class=title>TEXT you can use  $('a.title').each(function (title) {
[10:32] nickhac:             stories.push(title.text);

[10:51] [algo]: I'm making a site on Express
[10:51] [algo]: how can I setup routing to include domain?
[10:52] [algo]: a-site.com  and  b-site.com should route differently
[10:52] chjj: [algo]: youre going to want to use the vhost middleware
[10:52] [algo]: a-ha
[10:52] [algo]: npm install vhost?
[10:52] chjj: no, it comes with connect/express

[10:53] eirikb: Hello. Is it possible to use a gitmodule (npm install git or similar) to know when a repo is updated, and then do a pull?

[10:54] chjj: theres an example for express ^
[10:54] [algo]: chjj: guess I see how to implement it thanks
[10:55] sholmes: Do you guys know if it's possible to run node on a chrome notebook?
[10:55] eirikb: sholmes: I would guess so, it runs a linux kernel and has stdlib, libgcc etc, right?
[10:56] sholmes: Idk, I suppose it does, I never played with one.
[10:57] sholmes: It would just be interesting to see if you could somehow make Node an integral part of the Chrome OS.
[10:57] eirikb: I tested ChromiumOS once, and if it's similar to that it should work
[10:57] sholmes: One thing that's missing from Chrome OS is P2P applications.
[10:57] eirikb: P2P? What is this, 1998?
[10:57] sholmes: Everything is centralized with servers. I'd like to see more decentralization on the web.
[10:58] sholmes: Yes it is
[10:58] stagas: sholmes++
[10:58] v8bot:  stagas has given a beer to sholmes. sholmes now has 1 beers.
[10:58] sholmes: thanks stagas.
[10:58] eirikb: stagas: You would like to see something like the Opera thing?
[10:58] sholmes: Yes actually
[10:59] sholmes: I think that's the next step for the web.
[10:59] eirikb: And you want to build it from scratch, using node?
[10:59] sholmes: -- Bringing server technologies to the personal computer.
[11:00] eirikb: And NAT will not be a problem at all
[11:00] stagas: I'd like to have decentralized anonymous hosting
[11:00] sholmes: Idk, what's there to build? I'm thinking about more of a accessible computer, a server PC so to speak. Where you can access your files from other computers, but the files on your actual PC at home.
[11:01] eirikb: sholmes: Port unite? :)

[11:03] dve: W3C are working on a decentralized standard http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/his_could_be_big_decentralized_web_standard_under.php
[11:03] sholmes: I say semi-server because they don't need to be as full blown as regular servers.

[11:05] stagas: it was posted yesterday I think
[11:06] AAA_awright: sholmes: Are you familiar with Bitcoin and Namecoin?
[11:07] sholmes: AAA_awright: yes I am, just spent the whole day on bitcoin actually lol
[11:07] AAA_awright: I don't see you in #bitcoin-dev or #namecoin
[11:08] AAA_awright: A bit (but not as much as I like) of action happens there
[11:08] AAA_awright: I was unfamiliar with dve's link but it's AWESOME to see teh w3c tackling that
[11:08] AAA_awright: Otherwise I was going to
[11:09] AAA_awright: sholmes: My vision goes like this... We need to replace email
[11:09] sholmes: I was just there not but a few minutes ago, I closed it. Getting ready for bed.
[11:09] AAA_awright: Well, elevator speech version then
[11:09] lukegalea has joined the channel
[11:10] AAA_awright: sholmes: Facebook is pretty much a better version of email where you can send messages to your contacts. Except with Facebook, it's semantically meaningful. The W3C could do this already, we just need to add semantics to messages with RDF, and be able to send those messages on a p2p network to your friends, using Phantom...
[11:10] AAA_awright: sholmes: Authentication is done with WebID, payment with Bitcoin (to replace credits of various sorts)
[11:10] AAA_awright: With Phantom, you have a constant address no matter what IP you are on
[11:11] AAA_awright: You use this to send messages like emails to friends, without a server. You encrypt the message, sign the encrypted message, then encrypt that again, to ensure that no one can verify you signed the fully decrypted message unless you have the recipiant's private key.
[11:12] AAA_awright: You add on the tech specified by dve's link and you've replaced Skype as well.
[11:12] AAA_awright: Ta-da
[11:12] AAA_awright: That's all of it.
[11:12] dve: soooo.. when can we have it
[11:12] AAA_awright: sholmes: So what I'm building aims to do all of that with Node.js
[11:12] fangel has joined the channel
[11:12] AAA_awright: dve: I want people who know RDF and Node.js
[11:13] AAA_awright: Or could port Phantom to Node.js
[11:13] kohai: @secoif: npm changing default to install to local is fully retarded, breaks near every npm tutorial online. How about configurable defaults? #nodejs
[11:14] AAA_awright: dve: But I started on this a year ago and the tech barely even existed, only Node.js and RDF. Now it's Bitcoin, Namecoin, Phantom, the W3C's decentralized communications protocol...
[11:14] dve: AAA_awright stagas Id not heard of Phantom, what state is it in?
[11:14] sholmes: RDF?
[11:14] AAA_awright: dve: I JUST TODAY saw Phantom so I have no clue
[11:14] sholmes: I've never heard of phantom.
[11:14] AAA_awright: sholmes: It's a way of making statements about resources, it's appropriately called Resource Description Framework
[11:14] AAA_awright: And it's globally unieuq
[11:15] AAA_awright: You use URIs to identify resources
[11:15] AAA_awright: So for instance, I could say "<This image my friend postes> HasAPerson XYZ"
[11:15] AAA_awright: And also describe the location in the image their face is
[11:15] AAA_awright: etc
[11:16] sholmes: is it like a markup language?
[11:16] AAA_awright: And if your email client has the semantics installed, it would know how to interpert that
[11:16] ardcore has joined the channel
[11:16] AAA_awright: It isn't a markup, it's a data model
[11:16] eirikb has left the channel
[11:16] AAA_awright: It's more like DOM
[11:16] sholmes: Ah, I vaguely understand.
[11:16] AAA_awright: RDF is to (the various formats you can express RDF with) as DOM is to XML
[11:17] kbni: greetings 
[11:17] sholmes: But, if I were to re-invent the URI scheme (off topic, but w/e), I would have not had sub-domains and only had top-level domains.
[11:17] AAA_awright: And it's globally unique, that's important, so I can "link" my data, just like we can link webpages
[11:17] sholmes: And I wouldn't have had the concept of domain extensions.
[11:17] AAA_awright: I think I would
[11:18] AAA_awright: But these are URIs so you can use things other than http:// domain names
[11:18] AAA_awright: ISBN, UUIDs, etc
[11:18] kbni: has anyone here usd node.js to reverse proxy to fastcgi?
[11:18] sholmes: FTP, HTTPS...
[11:18] AAA_awright: Right, anything that describes a resource
[11:18] AAA_awright: That is globally unique
[11:19] sholmes: I would have used a slash (/) infront of the domain like so, /google, /facebook.
[11:19] sholmes: Then put the protocol before the slash. http/google.
[11:20] isaqual has joined the channel
[11:20] AAA_awright: sholmes: The difference is if it's a network resource or not, // means network resource
[11:20] AAA_awright: There's a lot of information URIs carry
[11:20] stagas: sholmes: that stuff implies a server, which is the opposite of decentralized, the thing is you only care about the resource, not the transports. the resource could live anywhere or be p2p, you just need a kind of link to it, like bittorrent
[11:20] ardcore has left the channel
[11:20] AAA_awright: sholmes: Let me make my shameless plug for my project http://magnode.org/ I'll start sending mail to http://groups.google.com/group/magnode when I make a release
[11:22] sholmes: stagas: yeah, I said I was digressing off topic.
[11:22] AAA_awright: Well, I just killed it somehow
[11:23] sholmes: However, if you were using another protocol for decentralized resource links, you could do something like drl/billscomputer

[15:00] chapel: or -f -oo
[15:00] chapel: idk exactly
[15:00] chapel: you need two - before multicharacter arguments
[15:00] augustl: so if you want your cli to handle -foo as -f -o -o you can't use optimist?
[15:00] chapel: at least to be able to do argv.foo
[15:00] chapel: so you want -foo to be -f -o -o ?
[15:01] chapel: actually -foo should be -f -o -o, I believe so (I think I was wrong earlier)

[16:57] kohai: @substack: props to @mikeal for the excellent #jsbbq
[16:58] Phatbyte: Does anyone know how can I have a 'net' socket streaming to an 'http' connection ? eg: 5 people connect to chat.foo.org:8000 from telnet, and everything they type in could be viewed in realtime from www.foo.org. I don't know how can I setup this type of connections
[16:58] broofa has joined the channel
[16:58] jakeg: python-tornado suggests running that behind an nginx proxy, multiple instances per server (around 1 per core). any such similar recommendation for node?
[16:58] Phatbyte: I mean, combining them so I can access request.write from my socket connection
[16:59] dans has joined the channel
[16:59] dans: does anyone have an example of a simple auth strategy using connect-auth with express?
[17:00] jmoyers: Phatbyte: can't use vanilla http for that
[17:00] jmoyers: Phatbyte: need a real time transport, like socket.io, long polling, etc
[17:00] kohai: @phineasb: I'm at TechCrunch Disrupt w/ @jericsinger http://4sq.com/jfnLZp
[17:00] Phatbyte: can't be done using core modules ?
[17:00] jmoyers: but i would push input from net.socket into a queue, and then push data down to clients with socket.io
[17:01] HerrTopf has joined the channel
[17:01] jmoyers: no -- but socket.io is like, uber simple to get started with. grab npm and install it, will work out of the box

[17:02] beriberikix: the node community is amazing - in less the 24 hours, folks were able to turn this slick json select lib into a npm package: http://search.npmjs.org/#/JSONSelect

[17:08] jmoyers: workarounds etc
[17:09] [algo]: yeah
[17:09] [algo]: or they could just write it correctly and carefully
[17:09] [algo]: to workaround old IE
[17:09] [algo]: (which is pretty annoying)
[17:09] jmoyers: well they do have code to do that
[17:10] jmoyers: https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/blob/master/backbone.js#L755-769
[17:10] [algo]: and it's buggy
[17:10] [algo]: to death
[17:10] jmoyers: yeah well
[17:10] chjj: no such thing as old IE, there is only IE, and its all terrible
[17:10] jmoyers: open source, brother
[17:10] [algo]: ok no need to talk
[17:10] [algo]: I just wondered if it's supported
[17:10] chjj: and its written by terrible people
[17:10] [algo]: if it is, I could write patch etc
[17:10] [algo]: chjj: why you so sure?
[17:10] [algo]: chjj: worked on it? :)
[17:11] chjj: sure of what? that IE is terrible?
[17:11] [algo]: that it is written by terrible people
[17:11] chjj: its not hard to be sure of that
[17:11] [algo]: I like Eric Lawrence
[17:11] chjj: or at the very least, written by very irresponsible people
[17:11] [algo]: that guy made Fiddler
[17:11] [algo]: awesome stuff
