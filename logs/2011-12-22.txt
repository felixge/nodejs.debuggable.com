[00:01] perezd: cool, if I vendor node into an app, I want to avoid needing to be root.
[00:01] ryah: perezd: compiling into android NDK for v0.4 is prohibitably difficult
[00:01] perezd: ie: making root filesystems
[00:01] perezd: ryah: any advice/pointers/articles I can research?
[00:01] ryah: perezd: no - but i've spent some time looking into this last year
[00:02] ryah: any work you do should be using master

[00:11] joshsmith: jerrysv: actually, I *can* use ready.js for its aggregation capabilities, and then use uglify as a post-aggregation step to minify/obfuscate
[00:12] WeezzZ: jesusabdullah: json, yes that was exactly that I was meaning, but how to ? Is there a specific way ? a good sample or tutorial I should know ?

[00:13] jerrysv: plans are for on-the-fly minification via filters, as well as good if-modified-since 304 handling

[00:37] jerrysv: just checking the dumb stuff :)
[00:37] TimTim: :)
[00:38] jerrysv: maybe separate out to another startup script just for the node app, and make sure that starts up fine, then call that from the upstart script?

[00:47] TimTim: jerrysv, for some reason upstarting node  by itself works fine... but after creating a separate upstart for redis, i have to manually start node
[00:48] TimTim: i think it might have to do with the order of the upstarts (node needs redis)
[00:48] bnoordhuis: DTrejo: bump `ulimit -n`
[00:48] TimTim: which is why i did it like you see in the pastebin with the "&&
[00:48] jerrysv: TimTim: that's odd.  i tend to start up my services separately though

[01:07] TimTim: i looked for something like that but i misleadingly read somewhere that the upstart pages on ubuntu.com were lacking... maybe what i read was just out of date

[01:09] Leemp: Question: Is Object.keys() valid in nodejs? Mine doesn't seem to have it, but i assume that's because the version i am using is horribly old.. so i'm just checking to make sure
[01:09] cmr: Leemp: Not here I don't, 0.6.6
[01:10] cmr: I take it back, 0.6.5
[01:10] AvianFlu: Object.keys() should be there

[01:10] cmr: I take it back.
[01:10] Ownatik has joined the channel
[01:10] cmr: I was doing Object().keys, my bad.
[01:11] Leemp: Oh duh, my bad. Object.x always throws me for a loop. I assume "Object.whatever means all objects, including my own, will have that property. Eg: console.log(myObject.keys()). Instead it should be Object.keys(myObject)
[01:12] Leemp: Why is that anyway? Isn't Object the root of all objects? So why have the format of Object.keys(myObject) when you could have the format of myObject.keys()?

[01:14] Lingerance: Object is a function (which can act like an object if you need it to)
[01:14] alejandromg: Leemp: Object.keys it's ES5, nothing to do with node ;) To read: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/
[01:14] Lingerance: Whereas all objects will get Object's prototype which is Object.prototype
[01:14] Leemp: Lingerance: Ah right
[01:14] Lingerance: Thus: Object.prototype.keys = Object.keys; // this will make x.keys() work
[01:14] Leemp: Lingerance: Still getting used to prototypical inheritance
[01:15] Lingerance: HOWEVER.  You should not be extending Object.prototype.
[01:15] Lingerance: Which is why those things are on Object

[03:35] Sorella: sshaginyan, you probably should take a deeper look into closures, currying, partial application and general higher-order functions. They'll improve your program structure and modularity a lot :3
[03:35] WeezzZ: What would prefer ? MongDb or CouchDb ? Wich one is the most integrated with node.js ?

[03:37] cmr: Thus making book irrelevant.
[03:37] krazyj: hey all… does anyone have any suggestions on a simple localhost HTTP server that will echo HTTP REST request content?
[03:38] krazyj: for testing REST calls and such
[03:38] dr0id has joined the channel
[03:39] cmr: But that's just me.
[03:39] Sorella: sshaginyan, I don't know that article, but most "design patterns for JS" that I've seen were trying to mimick Java design patterns, which just doesn't work since the languages have not the slightest close semantics. Java suffers from problems that JS doesn't, and vice-versa, so you need different mindsets to attack problems.
[03:40] Sorella: sshaginyan, again, I think a high functional programming background and a knowledge of prototypical inheritance are the key to writing better JS programs. As cmr said, patterns should come naturally for each context.
[03:41] Sorella: what matters is knowing the underlying concept, now which workaround to use in everywhich case, imho.

[03:52] bradleymeck: marcello3d, generally make a branch for 0.4 and just backport critical updates, i would not recommend maintaining full backport
[03:53] marcello3d: the only difference is support for 'hex' encoding
[03:53] mandric has joined the channel
[03:53] marcello3d: I don't want to deal with backporting for such a trivial difference
[03:53] cmr: Could you use a helper function that falls back when there is no support?

[06:54] xeodox: bradleymeck: if you have now.js, do you still need socket.io?
[06:55] xeodox: (i know its built on top of it, but would you still need to use socket.io alone?)
[06:55] bradleymeck: no npm will handle the dependencies for you
[06:56] xeodox: i know..i meant…in my code

[06:57] bogomips2_ has joined the channel
[06:57] bradleymeck: xeodox, it does things using socket.io that are non-trivial, but it may be less suitable than just socket.io

[09:16] Glenjamin: Bird_: try running npm rebuild

[09:16] insin: aaargh, never did I think "did you mean?" would turn into such a menace. Just search for my frigging terms, google!
[09:16] Bird_: Glenjamin: from within the contextify folder?
[09:16] Bird_: and mind you, I'm on windows which can't compile it - hence I need the precompiled
[09:17] icebox: Bird_: Once I get the same error... Clean the cache, check if there is only one contextify module
[09:18] icebox: Bird_:  did you do git clone https://github.com/Benvie/contextify.git in myproject/node_modules dir?
[09:18] Bird_: I grabbed the zipball, shouldn't that be the same?
[09:19] icebox: Bird_: maybe... I am saying you what I did :)
[09:19] Bird_: Might as well try, hang on!
[09:20] Glenjamin: Bird_: ah, dunno about windows
[09:20] icebox: Glenjamin: :) it happens :)

[09:21] adambeynon has joined the channel
[09:21] Bird_: same thing
[09:21] icebox: Bird_: doing npm ls do you see a contextify module?
[09:21] Bird_: I'm install cygwin now, should that allow me to compile it?
[09:21] icebox: Bird_: yes, but with 0.4.x node
[09:22] Bird_: ah, that's no good
[09:22] icebox: Bird_: patience... it should work
[09:22] Bird_: icebox: yes, there is indeed a contextify
[09:22] Bird_: at the wrong version (0.0.6)
[09:22] icebox: Bird_:  ok... npm rm contextify
[09:23] icebox: Bird_: why wrong? Benvie's contextify is 0.0.6
[09:23] _baton_ has joined the channel
[09:23] icebox: Bird_: it is not the new one 0.0.7
[09:23] Bird_: oh, hmm, let me check if the dependancy is wrong
[09:24] Bird_: removed it now btw
[09:24] Bird_: git clone again then?
[09:24] icebox: Bird_: yep

[09:26] Bird_: v0.6.6
[09:26] Bird_: so should be right
[09:26] Bird_: (afaik)
[09:26] icebox: Bird_: yes... but it is not that the problem
[09:27] icebox: Bird_: I am not using my laptop at the moment and I cannot check my configuration about contextify

[09:33] icebox: Bird_: give me 5 mins I have been writing an email... then I will check in the issues of contextify project and in the Benvie's fork

[10:28] noobnoder: AndreasMadsen what do you mean by that? Should i use it then in production?
[10:28] AndreasMadsen: noobnoder: You should use the v0.6 in production yes!

[10:35] AndreasMadsen: noobnoder: I know but process.binding("net") was a change right ;)
[10:36] noobnoder: AndreasMadsen :-D Yea. I just meant i will use the current cluster module and will be happily convert to your new one when the time comes :-D

[11:59] noobnoder_: AndreasMadsen And i was like wtf?
[11:59] noobnoder_: AndreasMadsen :D

[12:01] noobnoder_: AndreasMadsen I just found it strange. What is even more strange, my whole team tested manually the site and they percieved the site to be faster when using 8 instances, even when the benchmark does not prove that.
[12:01] cmr: noobnoder_: did they know you were using 8 instances?

[12:02] Glenjamin: there should have been less chance of having to wait for a slot
[12:02] AndreasMadsen: noobnoder_: But this is something we will have to look intro. Until we have assumed more cores is faster.
[12:03] Glenjamin: more cores is usually slower, because you have to alter your algorithms for concurrency

[12:06] noobnoder_: lol
[12:06] Glenjamin: right, so 8 instances on 2 cores
[12:06] Glenjamin: isn't going to help
[12:06] noobnoder_: ohh soz
[12:06] AndreasMadsen: noobnoder_: You should make 2 instances
[12:07] Glenjamin: especially if ab is on the same box
[12:07] noobnoder_: Win 7
[12:07] Glenjamin: since you now have 8 nodes and an ab process contending for 2 cpus

[12:37] Glenjamin: http://package.json.nodejitsu.com/ doesn't render on ~1000px page width
[12:37] mmalecki: Glenjamin: mind taking a screenshot?
[12:37] mmalecki: I don't really have that wide monitor around
[12:37] mmalecki: I'll when I get back home
[12:38] Glenjamin: the page is too wide for my screen
[12:38] mmalecki: Glenjamin: so we should use some fixed width?
[12:38] Glenjamin: i'm not sure, it looks like it is using a fixed width, but its larger than my screen
[12:39] Multiply: It renders fine for me.
[12:39] Multiply: Even when the window is less than or around 1000px :P

[12:42] Glenjamin: well no
[12:43] Glenjamin: there's a horizontal scroll bar, and i can't see all the content
[12:43] Glenjamin: despite there being little enough content that it could quite happily fit
[12:43] Multiply: It still rendered correctly.
[12:43] Glenjamin: then my original phrasing was unclear :)
[12:44] Multiply: But you're right. There should be some sort of fluid-ish container to the right.
[12:44] pandeiro has joined the channel
[12:44] Multiply: Instead of a fixed one, that is.
[12:44] Glenjamin: amusingly, it's a widescreen monitor - it's just rotated 90 degrees
[12:45] Multiply: Simply remove "width: 500px" from the .hint in the CSS
[12:46] Multiply: Or even, set it to max-width: 500px
[12:46] Multiply: So it'll look like it does now, when you've got more than 1000px width :P
[12:47] Glenjamin: .container has margin-left: 100px and margin-right: auto;
[12:47] Multiply: Don't mind the container.
[12:47] mmalecki has joined the channel
[12:47] halfh: :D
[12:47] Multiply: .hint should have "width" changed to "max-width" and it'll be fine.
[12:47] halfh: sorry wrong window
[12:47] Multiply: It is in chrome anyway.

[12:52] mmalecki: Brandon_R: haven't seen it yet, what is that?
[12:53] Brandon_R: a low level socket.io
[12:53] Brandon_R: made by the same person who made socket.io
[12:53] `3rdEden: I wouldn't call it a low level socket.io
[12:53] `3rdEden: See it more as socket.io's new internals
[12:53] `3rdEden: that we have seperated out of the socket.io
[12:53] Brandon_R: https://github.com/LearnBoost/engine.io
[12:53] `3rdEden: it's basically all the fallback transports that socket.io is using
[12:54] `3rdEden: same counts for websocket.io which is a copy of the socket.io websocket parsers
[12:54] `3rdEden: socket.io 1.0~ will be build upon those modules.

[16:14] trose: is there a standard way to test an express server using faked requests? I'm looking at expresso but it doesn't seem to have that functionality. I don't know much about unit testing so go easy on me if this is a dumb question.
[16:14] dmportella: hi guys i am working on a high profile project, building a node application. trying for 10.000 concurrent users at the moment we are load testing our server usign ab with 10000 requests on 1000 concurrents. current we are not getting a great response time. with 300 request/second. we have a rackspace server with 4 cores and 8gb of mem.

[16:26] dmportella: we are using the cluster module added to nodejs on 0.6
[16:26] Glenjamin: your app is limited by some other factor
[16:27] swaj: yeah the bottleneck has to be something else.
[16:27] swaj: maybe disk io or database dependecies
[16:27] dmportella: not sure the same app running on my local on 1million requests with 1000 concurrents does 12k request a sec

[17:54] jstash: so what are you concerned about? the obfuscation of V8's memory structure?
[17:54] jesusabdullah: i think if someone has that direct access to your server's memory then you have bigger problems
[17:54] d_low-linux: whether someone could spy on the process and get the string
[17:54] jstash: i'd recommend "don't store it; pass it through"
[17:54] jstash: (don't decrypt or decode it)
[17:55] d_low-linux: well it's a plantext response from the server im sending the request to

[17:56] Brandon_R: it should work no matter the processor jocafa

[18:07] pronam has joined the channel
[18:07] erichocean: otherwise, all spaces
[18:08] tjfontaine: oh, resolve4 always does dns, doesn't do the hosts lookup, I remember that now
[18:08] erichocean: this is the code I'm running https://gist.github.com/c7d418afd93ce645a562
[18:10] erichocean: right, but shouldn't dns be looking in /etc/hosts?
[18:11] tjfontaine: that's not really how it works, there is a "gethostbyname" style which will do the normal libc check hosts file, if not found check dns, and then there is the avoid hosts style all together and go straight to dns

[18:12] erichocean: and I should handle it specially
[18:12] tjfontaine: erichocean: well, lookup() does the /etc/hosts dance, but resolve* doesn't
[18:12] Juan77 has joined the channel
[18:12] tjfontaine: erichocean: also, some upstream dns will publish localhost records, but not all do, for instance google dns doesn't

[20:15] CoverSlide: which could be easily done
[20:15] CoverSlide: using this inside the function call
[20:16] secoif: wmage1 that somewhat defeats the purpose of using an evented environment. you might want to look into promises though
[20:16] CoverSlide: by the way, what is the context of a require'd file, just a blank anonymous object?

[20:27] bradleymeck: when working with non-tech people
[20:27] AAA_awright: What's the task?

[20:38] LuckySMack: what would be the best route to take if I wanted to use node to be used as more of a site management platform. i work at a web development company and want to make a platform with node to manage all the sites we have. Not manage/manipulate content. Also maybe to do something like let it throw up a new site (such as wordpress) with the given settings. What would be the best way to go about this using node?

[20:46] context: nice
[20:46] LuckySMack: context: yea im going to, but as I get into it, not having used either before, Im just wondering what some of the pros and cons might be of the differences. I don't want to try something and have it just completely not work out (not that I wouldnt learn anything, and not that they both wont work because I'm sure they both would). 
[20:46] mmalecki: TheJH: do a full disclosure on this issue.
[20:46] mmalecki: they ignored you for a month
[20:46] mmalecki: you can do that.

[20:48] bradleymeck: a lot...
[20:48] jaha: yea thats what i understood
[20:48] jaha: dont know much about dnode
[20:49] bradleymeck: dnode is just rpc over socket.io

[20:50] cmr: Why would one need to do that?
[20:50] TheFuzzball: I'm getting a bit confused with all of this asynchronous stuff… I never know where to put my code in order to ensure that the variable will be populated before it's executed. So far I'm trying to use a callback - http://pastebin.com/DAtYHU52 but I need some good design patterns for this.
[20:50] jesusabdullah: In my case, I was testing websockets
[20:51] jesusabdullah: turning off the fallbacks made it more obvious when websockets were breaking
[20:51] TheFuzzball: Mainly I'm getting stuck with sqlite3, it's rife with race conditions.
[20:51] cmr: Ew code style.
[20:51] cmr: jesusabdullah: I can see that

[21:40] TheFuzzball: haha, that's not deleting it :)
[21:41] TheFuzzball: http://cl.ly/Co9z
[21:41] TheFuzzball: That's only a snippet of the files it installs, and without an uninstaller.
[21:42] TheFuzzball: I don't want that kind of muck, brew is better.
[21:42] ben_alman: is there any way with npm to just get a list of the packages you've installed (and not their deps)?
[21:43] andrew12: anyone wanna explain to me why people seem to like to put commas at the beginning of their lines rather than the end?
[21:43] tbranyen: andrew12: style and contrived issues :-p
[21:44] CoverSlide: it's easier to append to a comma-separated list that way
[21:44] CoverSlide: i.e. the last element cannot had a comma
[21:44] tbranyen: unless its in an object/array literal
[21:44] CoverSlide: so to add to it, you have to add a comma to the last element, then your next element
[21:44] ben_alman: anyone?
[21:44] TheFuzzball: ben_alman npm ls?
[21:44] CoverSlide: tbranyen: true, except ie throws a fit
[21:44] jesusabdullah: ben_alman: ls node_modules ? :v
[21:45] ben_alman: TheFuzzball: nope
[21:45] CoverSlide: so that practice extends to front-end stuff
[21:45] ben_alman: global modules
[21:45] ben_alman: ?
[21:45] jesusabdullah: ah
[21:45] ben_alman: npm ls -g (less pretty, no deps)

[23:11] eastc: as a matter of interest, can node.js effectively replace php and nginx?
[23:11] Hamms: eastc, yep
[23:11] eastc: so I can completely switch over to node.js
[23:11] eastc: wow
[23:11] tjholowaychuk: almost anything CAN replace php
[23:11] tjholowaychuk: WILL is another question
[23:11] tjfontaine: monkeys and typewriters for instance
[23:11] eastc: by will you mean what is popular?
[23:12] shaggydog97 has joined the channel
[23:12] eastc: or the 'standard'
[23:12] tjholowaychuk: popularity. php blows but it's popular
[23:12] jerrysv: i think you're being nice to php
[23:12] jerrysv: too nice
[23:12] Hamms: it also depends on what you mean by "replace"
[23:13] tk has joined the channel
[23:13] Hamms: if you mean can node replace php in your office or as far as what you do is concerned, then definitely
[23:13] eastc: can do all the functions of php in an equivalent or better fashion and more
[23:13] eastc: or feature wise
[23:13] tjholowaychuk: eastc yeah, but so can ruby, python, lisp, haskell, erlang, js, *most other langs here*
[23:14] tjfontaine: hey you forgot <my favorite lang>
[23:14] eastc: so php is basically old news and node.js is the new thing as an all-in--one web stack sans a relational databse or something like that
[23:14] cmr: nodejs isn't an all-in-one web stack.
[23:14] andrew12: node.js is just a platform
[23:14] jerrysv: but javascript can be
[23:14] tjfontaine: eastc: the amount of existing code bases out there for php hardly make it old news, anymore than cobol
[23:15] andrew12: with a different model from any other programming language
[23:15] jerrysv: browser+node+couchdb/mongo/pg&v8

[23:15] alexis has left the channel
[23:17] TimTimTim: any recommendations for SSL? are the free ones reliable (the few that are trusted by major browsers)? or should i just spend the money and get something "good"?
[23:17] Dmitrijus: well, dunno about node.js, but the ideas are going here to stay
[23:17] andrew12: TimTimTim: are you talking about certificates? just generate your own
[23:17] cmr: TimTimTim: What are your requirements?
[23:17] TooTallNate: TimTimTim: i've used StartSSL for the free one
[23:18] TooTallNate: TimTimTim: https://tootallnate.net/setting-up-free-ssl-on-your-node-server
[23:18] eastc: so if a website's focus is nearly all realtime based then the server side communication to a mysql databse for instance and the client side javascript possibly eliminating requirements to use server-side php or any other server-side language other than node and various modules to connect to it. right?
[23:18] TimTimTim: andrew12, if i generate my own, will visitors to the site see any warning message or anything?
[23:18] tk has joined the channel
[23:18] cmr: TimTimTim: Probably.
[23:18] TimTimTim: yes, eastc that's the best way to go imo
[23:18] TooTallNate: TimTimTim: generating your own will display a warning message
[23:18] CoverSlide: there is cacert
[23:18] andrew12: TimTimTim: they will see something along the lines of "this certificate isn't verified!"
[23:19] TimTimTim: yeah i don't want users to see any warning message
[23:19] braoru has joined the channel
[23:19] andrew12: then you'llhave to pay
[23:19] CoverSlide: but i dont think any borwsers have it
[23:19] andrew12: probably
[23:19] eastc: i see
[23:19] CoverSlide: i think it's the same with startssl
[23:19] TooTallNate: CoverSlide: what's the same?
[23:19] lightcap has joined the channel
[23:19] TimTimTim: startssl is the free one i was considering
[23:19] TooTallNate: I'm using them for tootallnate.net, there's no warning message
[23:19] eastc: is node much more difficult to learn for server-side scripting as related to php or any other language?
[23:19] eastc: relatively speaking
[23:19] jesusabdullah: Not difficult, just different
[23:20] TimTimTim: eastc, if you know javascript, you're good to know
[23:20] TimTimTim: *good to go

[23:20] andrew12: ssl is lame anyways
[23:20] andrew12: :p
[23:20] TimTimTim: i'm pretty sure i read somewhere recently that startssl trusted by all major browsers
[23:20] TimTimTim: *is trusted
[23:20] CoverSlide: really?
[23:20] TimTimTim: man i'm making entirely too many typos these days
[23:20] TooTallNate: TimTimTim: i've never had any problems
[23:20] TimTimTim: yeah
[23:20] CoverSlide: well that's cool
[23:20] eastc: anyone know where to start for just learning node and building an entire website from it
[23:21] eastc: the basics and how the modules fit in i guess
[23:21] cmr: eastc: Well, do you know javascript?
[23:21] eastc: yea
[23:21] CoverSlide: oh startssl you get the first year free?
[23:21] eastc: but i mean the syntax for node
[23:21] cmr: That's a good question. I've just used the API docs directly, don't know if there are tutorials/walkthroughs/books (I'm not a fan of them)
[23:21] TooTallNate: CoverSlide: they have a completely free version
[23:21] cmr: Node is javascript, it uses v8 (also used by chrome)
[23:21] TimTimTim: i mean i'll do some research now but i figured there's enough people in here that if there was something good/trusted/free out there one of you would know :)
[23:21] eastc: where can i find the node api?
[23:21] eastc: :)
[23:22] cmr: http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/index.html
[23:22] cmr: Available on the front page of nodejs.org ...
[23:22] TimTimTim: eastc, there are tons of examples for pretty much everything you'd ever need to do
[23:22] TimTimTim: especially if you're coming from php
[23:22] TooTallNate: TimTimTim: are like the last 5 mentionings of startssl not enough?
[23:22] CoverSlide: i wish google would index docs/latest instead of 0.3.1 or whatever
[23:23] cmr: CoverSlide: I've started to see latest creep in slowly.
[23:23] fwg has joined the channel
[23:23] TimTimTim: lol TooTallNate startssl is what i was gonna go with to begin with, but thank you for confirming :)
[23:23] TooTallNate: np
[23:23] cmr: But yeah, I was working off of 0.1 docs or something like that before I realized what version it was, and I was wondering why *nothing* worked.
[23:23] CoverSlide: i wonder which sites are referring to the 0.3.x docs
[23:23] CoverSlide: we should ddos them until google re-indexes
[23:23] andrew12: that won't work if their servers are using node
[23:24] andrew12: :P
[23:24] TooTallNate: CoverSlide: if you just google "node fs" then you'll get results for older node versions
[23:24] andrew12: why doesn't it just always use /latest
[23:24] andrew12: heh
[23:24] cmr: Using /latest is pretty meh, IMO.
[23:24] CoverSlide: TooTallNate: Which is exactly the problem I'm complaining about
[23:24] cmr: As it changes. If you're referencing something in a blog post, you don't want your reference to change on you.
[23:24] TimTimTim: eastc, i actually just started working with node < 2 weeks ago and it only took me like 6-7 days to convert the original backend from php to node
[23:24] cmr: (depending on the reference, I guess)

[23:26] smathy has joined the channel
[23:27] CoverSlide: it just seems that there's a huge volume of sites that refer to the 0.3.7 docs if google is indexing those higher
[23:27] kerigan: hm can't get map reduce to work, is there anything obvious wrong with this code: http://pastebin.com/JWjY5vMc ?

[23:27] jbpros has joined the channel
[23:28] CoverSlide: kerigan: why isn't map returning anything?
[23:28] andrew12: so... what do you guys recommend for someone who wants to write a p2p protocol using node?
[23:29] kerigan: no seems to be empty result
[23:29] Hamms: map doesn't need to return anything
[23:29] andrew12: use underscore!
[23:29] CoverSlide: shouldn't it?
[23:30] CoverSlide: also, what is `emit`
[23:30] Hamms: emit is the function map needs to call
[23:31] Cogito_Ergo_Sum: guys ctrl-c doesn't seemt to work on linux for interrupting a node.js script
[23:31] Cogito_Ergo_Sum: what do i have to do
[23:31] Hamms: kerigan, the only thing that looks weird is calling findOne with {'_id':1}
[23:31] cmr: Cogito_Ergo_Sum: works here.
[23:31] kerigan: hm found that here: https://github.com/christkv/node-mongodb-native/blob/master/test/map_reduce_test.js
[23:31] kerigan: line 271
[23:32] Cogito_Ergo_Sum: cmr i'm from putty
[23:32] Hamms: kerigan, you'll notice he creates two objects on line 265
[23:32] cmr: Cogito_Ergo_Sum: I don't know what weird stuff, if any, putty does. Pretty sure they just bundle xterm.
[23:33] Hamms: kerigan, I'd change line 19 on your pastebin to collection.find({}, function(err, res){
[23:33] kerigan: oh ok
[23:34] Dmitrijus: andrew12: hm, what exactly do you want to write? :) i was very much eager to do some p2p stuff with node myself
[23:35] tedsuo has joined the channel
[23:35] andrew12: well before I actually made it do anything I wanted to be able to have a bunch of clients connect to each other to create a sort of mesh network, and whenever it has a message to send it sends it to every client it is connected to, and they send it to every client they're connected to until everyone has the message
[23:36] andrew12: of course you'd have to send a nonce, timestamp, and checksum with the messages too unless you trust the network (nonces will definitely be needed though so nothing gets received and emitted more than once)

[23:40] Dmitrijus: i kinda dislike watching tech videos
[23:41] Dmitrijus: i much prefer just to try it out myself istead!

[23:47] bemson: should one bother with setTimeout in node? and if so, should I not specify the "window" object or "this" when calling setTimeout?
[23:48] bemson: I usually pass "this" to my auto-executing closures, which I then reference as "window"… will that work in node?
[23:49] adrianF has joined the channel
[23:49] andrew12: node doesn't have a window
[23:50] fwg has joined the channel
[23:51] bemson: andrew12: I know that - I said that I pass "this" to my closures as an argument, and *call* it "window"
[23:51] tvw has joined the channel
[23:51] andrew12: then yeah that'll work
[23:51] andrew12: it should, at least
[23:51] bemson: I'm asking if "this.setTimeout" would work in node - when executed in the global scope
[23:51] strevat has joined the channel
[23:51] andrew12: you can just do setTimeout
[23:51] bemson: because node has special keywords - like "require" wherein "this.require" doesn't work
[23:52] bemson: andrew12: thx, that'll do
[23:52] andrew12: they're globals
[23:52] andrew12: global.require
[23:53] bemson: andrew12: so there is a "global" object containing require, etc?
[23:53] andrew12: yes.
[23:53] chjj: require is not a global
[23:53] andrew12: chjj: according to my node it is.
[23:54] andrew12: type 'global.require' in node, there it is
[23:54] chjj: andrew12: something is broken with your node then
[23:54] andrew12: chjj: uh...
[23:54] chjj: read lib/module.js - require is not a global
[23:54] chjj: it cant be, because its relative to each module
[23:55] andrew12: hmm
[23:55] cmr: Dmitrijus: I agree! I feel the same way about books and tutorials. I like node-tap, isaacs give a descriptive example file showing off tap that you can play with.

[23:55] cmr: There are a few good talks though. There was an amusing one by knuth that I liked.
[23:55] andrew12: ah
[23:56] chjj: require is no more a global than "exports" and "module"
[23:56] andrew12: maybe it just puts it in global too or something? heh
[23:56] chjj: node -e "console.log(global.require)"
[23:56] chjj: "undefined"
[23:57] andrew12: ah
[23:57] andrew12: in the REPL it isn't undefined
[23:57] andrew12: probably because the REPL can't have that wrapper
[23:58] chjj: dont trust the repl, its a completely different environment
[23:58] wilmoore has joined the channel
[23:58] andrew12: that wrapper explains how the magic __dirname and __filename work though :P
