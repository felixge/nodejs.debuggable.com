[00:01] astantona: if I have module A, which depends on module B, and I use npm to install A locally, can I also use B, like I can use A? I tried this and can't find it. Do I need to install B along side A?
[00:02] maxogden: astantona: if you put modules inside your node_modules folder they will be require()-able
[00:02] maxogden: astantona: oh you mean will you be able to require a submodule
[00:02] astantona: yes

[00:03] isaacs: astantona: if you require() something, then you depend on it.  install it.
[00:03] insin: yo need to install B too - you can require it from A's node_modules folder, but it's horrible
[00:03] astantona: ok
[00:03] isaacs: astantona: if A depends on B, and can use the one you already installed, it will not install a second copy, don't worry.
[00:03] isaacs: if it needs to, it will.  don't worry :)
[00:04] maxogden: isaacs: you should steal couchdb's relaxation theme
[00:04] astantona: excellent, that's what I was worried about

[00:10] copongcopong has joined the channel
[00:12] EhevuTov: vkandy, maybe something like put the result in a list?
[00:12] r04r has joined the channel
[00:13] vkandy: i am storing the results (to be unzipped later) but i am doing that for each request .. traffic is 200k/hour
[00:13] vkandy: i wanted to know if i am supposed to cache something of zlib ?? 
[00:14] vkandy: zlib options or some intermediary result??
[00:15] papachan has joined the channel
[00:15] EhevuTov: looks like you can put the result in a buffer or even on the filesystem.
[00:16] copongcopong has joined the channel
[00:16] EhevuTov: vkandy, I think what they're referring to, is if you're serving a txt file, for instance, instead of zipping it on each request (which could be thousands concurrently), just zip it once

[00:19] scrogson: Anyone have any experience with rendering 2 different MongoDB collections on a page using Express and Mongoose?
[00:20] lohkey: the amount of "collections you render" shouldn't matter
[00:21] scrogson: Yeah, I understand that bitâ€¦I guess my struggle is understanding how I should call the render method on the response object
[00:21] lohkey: call render on the render data when you have it ready
[00:22] lohkey: i have a feeling your problem isn't with mongo/express
[00:22] scrogson: do you know of any examples that shows this? I'm new to Node
[00:22] scrogson: I agree :)
[00:22] lohkey: sounds like your problem is grok'ing async code
[00:22] scrogson: yeah
[00:23] lohkey: checkout async, it will help you out a bit
[00:23] lohkey: https://github.com/caolan/async
[00:23] lohkey: by the sound of it you probably want either async.parallel or async.series
[00:24] scrogson: so are you saying that there isn't a way to do this without/learning an additional module?
[00:24] r04r has joined the channel
[00:24] lohkey: scrogson: there is, and i recommend you write your own
[00:24] lohkey: async doesn't work magically :)
[00:25] scrogson: ok
[00:25] lohkey: there are async patterns that you should learn if you plan on taking node.js seriously
[00:25] jhbot: 'Structuring a NodeJS module - variables and methods' by Matt Egan http://stackoverflow.com/q/9270079 (tags: javascript, closures, commonjs)
[00:25] lohkey: however, reinventing these wheels isn't desirable all the time
[00:25] lohkey: hence why a lib like async or seq, etc are often usefull
[00:26] scrogson: lohkey,  jhbot: thanks for the help
[00:26] scrogson: I'll take a look
[00:27] lohkey: scrogson: if you want to see how async.parallel looks you can just read the source ofc

[01:38] isaacs_away: bartek: check out restify
[01:39] isaacs_away: bartek: that's probably what you want.  also has a lot of reasonable defaults for stuff like etags and content-md5s and stuff

[04:19] muk_mb: is heroku the best place to host node.js stuff?
[04:19] Aria: Best for what purpose?
[04:19] r1ngzer0 has joined the channel
[04:19] Aria: There's lots of options with lots of different trade-offs.
[04:19] muk_mb: Aria: for hosting a web-service using node.js?
[04:20] muk_mb: oh? I'm only aware of no.de and heroku
[04:20] Aria: What sort of web service? That says nothing about what it does and what its requirements are.
[04:20] Dantas has joined the channel
[04:20] Aria: And EC2 and Rackspace Cloud and Joyent's other services.
[04:20] Aria: And your own hosting off of any ol' shell account or VPS
[04:20] Aria: And Nodejitsu
[04:20] muk_mb: I want an rss syncing service. Probably will use node.js+redis
[04:21] iangreenleaf has joined the channel
[04:21] Dantas: hi everyone, what is the best pattern used for all of you, in database layer ? ActiveRecord ? DataMapper ? Any npm module advice ? I will use CouchDB or MongoDB on my applications ! 
[04:21] sideshownz has joined the channel
[04:21] reid has joined the channel
[04:22] Aria: Dantas: Depends on what you're doing with it. Any reason you're looking for a pattern to apply instead of looking at what you need and recognizing a pattern there if there is one?
[04:22] teslan: if i use the request module inside of http.createServer() then all works ok but not if I follow the beginner book and use the request module from within the router function ... any ideas?
[04:22] Aria: muk_mb: heroku doesn't have the latest node; You might also need to evaluate what their limits are.
[04:23] Aria: teslan: What's a router function?
[04:23] muk_mb: Aria: noted. Thanks :)
[04:23] gregpascale has joined the channel
[04:23] Dantas: Aria: ActiveRecord and DataMapper, i think are generics. could fit , almost, every business. Its juts best practice ! I don't wanna create the DAO all by myself ! 
[04:24] Aria: Dantas: And all of those patterns are very Algol-derived-language OO patterns. You find them in Java, C++, C# type languages.
[04:24] Aria: Javascript is not the same type of OO. It's got some very different patterns, often.
[04:24] teslan: Aria: basically a function that is called from within createServer and which uses an array of url/function mappings ... so, it's just a function that is in a file of its own
[04:24] r04r has joined the channel
[04:24] Aria: (There's the Java-like OO, the Smalltalk-like OO, and the Self-like. Javascript is self-like.)
[04:24] Aria: teslan: Okay, and what's the problem you're having?
[04:25] Dantas: Aria: yeah, thumbs up !
[04:25] Aria: Dantas: "active record" can be summed up as "objects are simple and mostly generic, and save themselves"; Data Mapper can be summed up as "Objects aren't directly tied to the database, you tell something to save them"
[04:26] Dantas: Aria: Yeah, DataMapper  ( DAO LAYER ) , activeRecord model are tied directly with the db
[04:26] Aria: What you're doing with your data will affect what you do. If you're doing CRUD, and what you do with each type of object is pretty similar even if they're different things, then perhaps something like saving a simple object is natural -- something vaguely datamappery makes sense.
[04:27] Aria: In Javascript, my data objects would be little more than JSON blobs, and then I'd have a way to load and store them
[04:27] Aria: But that's actually rare in my use: Often I want to log the changes to objects, so something like operational transform makes sense, or I want to manage more careful mutations, so something like Mongo's update operators make sense.
[04:28] Dantas: Aria: nice !
[04:28] Dantas: I dont wanna use DataMapper, i prefer rich domain instead of anemic ! The model must know how to persist itself
[04:28] Aria: So, it really depends. Most of node's tools aim a bit lower in the stack than a lot of people are used to. You get stream access to things, often, as they're loaded or saved.
[04:29] wink__ has joined the channel
[04:29] startup has joined the channel
[04:29] Aria: Most of my code is not terribly OO. It's a terrible set of tools for lots of tasks.
[04:29] Aria: Lots more functional code in my work.
[04:29] r04r has joined the channel
[04:30] Aria: I might represent a chain of changes to something, rather than exposing the thing.
[04:30] Aria: The interface might be events for state transitions, and methods to trigger them.
[04:31] Aria: But it REALLY depends on what you're doing.
[04:31] Dantas: yeah !
[04:31] Aria: I just find I rather rarely use a pattern out of the GoF book.
[04:31] Dantas: should i read more javascript code ! do you have public github ?
[04:31] Aria: (And so many of them are one-liners in a dynamic language: patterns are what happens when your language can't express something succinctly.)
[04:31] Aria: http://github.com/aredridel/
[04:32] joshsmith has joined the channel
[04:32] Dantas: thanks
[04:32] Aria: Though most of what's there is the HTML5 parser.
[04:32] Aria: And that's a little too OO, actually. I need to rework its API to make up for some of these lessons.
[04:32] Aria: I'm working on something right now using operational transforms, actually. 
[04:33] Aria: The data loading and saving to the database is going to be entirely private to those objects.
[04:33] Dantas: ok
[04:34] nerdy has joined the channel
[04:34] Dantas: sorry, but, what is operational transforms ?
[04:34] tylerstalder has joined the channel
[04:34] muk_mb: Aria: what about cloudfoundry, worth a look?
[04:34] r04r has joined the channel
[04:35] Aria: muk_mb: Sure!
[04:36] Aria: Dantas: They're a way for multiple clients to change an object or thing at the same time, and resolve conflicts.
[04:36] Aria: Dantas: So the operations are things like 'At position 50, insert "hello"'
[04:36] Dantas: wow, interesting
[04:36] Aria: Yeah. 
[04:37] Aria: Super useful for multiple clients editing small parts of something larger.
[04:37] Dantas: yep
[04:37] Aria: The server keeps a revision number, and helps the clients resolve their actions.
[04:37] Dantas: yeah !
[04:38] cjm has joined the channel
[04:38] Aria: So insert(0, "Hello, ") + insert(8, "World")  = Insert(0, "Hello, World").
[04:38] Aria: If two clients connect, send the first two, a third could connect, and get the resulting single operation.
[04:38] mikeal has joined the channel
[04:38] teslan: Aria: so using request module, all works ok if i do it out of http.createServer() block but not if i do it from a function that createServer() calls

[04:39] Sly__ has joined the channel
[04:40] Aria: teslan: What does not working look like? Reference errors? Something more subtle?
[04:40] Dantas: Aria: multi version concurrency control
[04:40] cjm has joined the channel
[04:40] djbell has joined the channel
[04:40] Aria: Dantas: MVCC is neat, too. A different tactic -- more for consistent reads, but it makes things consistent by serializing operations that would conflict.
[04:41] take_cheeze has joined the channel
[04:41] lohkey: MVCC means you'd have to dup the entire doc on every edit
[04:41] teslan: Aria: times out
[04:41] Dantas: how the conflict manager detect the "would conflict " ?
[04:41] lohkey: or have some horrible diff/patch storage scheme
[04:41] Aria: Or break it up into pieces.
[04:42] Dantas: break into pieces ( per documents lines ) its better the dup the entire doc
[04:42] Aria: Dantas: In MVCC, you lock "rows" or whatever your equivalent structure is. So you can read your version as many times as you like, but when you go to update, you have to wait for other updaters to finish first.
[04:42] lohkey: Aria: but if versioning is important you'd have to make it more complex by ordering the versions per peice
[04:42] Aria: Dantas: Now that's weird. What part's timing out? 
[04:43] bentruyman has joined the channel
[04:43] Aria: Dantas: You're not forgetting something like a res.end() are you?
[04:43] muk_mb: Aria: what about windows azure, worth a crap?
[04:43] Aria: muk_mb: Good IO capabilities. Younger, still, but promising.
[04:43] Aria: muk_mb: I'm a bit Unix biased, but Windows really does have some nice APIs that Node makes good use of.
[04:44] muk_mb: do you know if you can build/deploy azure stuff from osx/linux?
[04:44] lohkey: libuv has a lot of IOCP'isms in it
[04:44] Aria: I have no idea, muk_mb
[04:44] lohkey: perf stuff that only windows can take advantage of
[04:44] r04r has joined the channel
[04:44] Aria: lohkey: Yeah. MVCC solves a different problem, really. It's about making sure data doesn't change while you read. But it will have to abort some transactions, and serialize others.
[04:44] niloy has joined the channel
[04:44] slloyd has joined the channel
[04:45] lohkey: i'd be curious to see some some IO benchmarks on libuv/node.js on windows vs *nix derivs
[04:45] Aria: It's still in flux, too. But it's good.
[04:45] lohkey: i would like to see how IOCP stacks up against epoll and kqueue
[04:45] gavin_huang has joined the channel
[04:45] bojicas has joined the channel
[04:46] muk_mb: hmm, looks like you need to be on windows for azure
[04:46] muk_mb: bummer
[04:46] lohkey: that sounds incredibly lame
[04:46] muk_mb: you need visual studio and junk
[04:47] michaelhartau: Anyone know of anything like Finagle (http://twitter.github.com/finagle/) built in node.js? Would love to see a rock-solid lib as a basis for node.js clients/servers
[04:47] lohkey: i'm writing a toy ircd with libuv in c atm, i ****ing love joyent/ry for releasing libuv
[04:48] Dantas: Aria: so to detect any conflict, every object has a version  and you compare with the Storage version when you persist, right ?
[04:48] muk_mb: lohkey: what's libuv do?
[04:48] jamescarr: à² _à² 
[04:48] Dantas: and every update/save are sequencial
[04:48] michaelhartau: Something with fault-tolerance, backpressure, service rego, connection pooling, load balancing, retries, metrics, etc all built in
[04:48] Aria: muk_mb: It's the low-level IO layer that Node uses.
[04:48] Aria: Dantas: If you fail updates that don't match versions, that's called optimistic locking.
[04:49] muk_mb: oh ok
[04:49] Aria: michaelhartau: That's something that you'd find in separate pieces in node.
[04:49] lohkey: libuv is basically libev + libeio + c-ares + hacked in support for windows IOCP
[04:49] muk_mb: is Nodester worth a look?
[04:49] Aria: muk_mb: Yes.
[04:49] r04r has joined the channel
[04:50] michaelhartau: Aria: yeah, i've seen a few pieces, but nothing that seems to indicate they've all been battle-tested together
[04:50] lohkey: we run node in raw iron at my job
[04:50] Aria: lohkey: Not so much hacked in. A separate implementation, actually.

[05:57] davidvip: would like to know how your do automated build + test + deployment for application written in nodejs?
[05:57] teslan: so why is it that inside of http.createServer() , i can not make a request call (using request module) inside of callback function for request objects "end" listener ?
[05:57] nicholas_ has joined the channel
[05:57] EhevuTov: davidvip, what kind of application
[05:58] take_cheeze has joined the channel
[05:59] davidvip: EhevuTov: the application is a messaging hub, transmitting request and reply to/from source and destination via json packages

[06:03] thepatr1ck: jaha: I've just ended up using ejs for now (I'd be happier with handlebars, but it didn't work out so well when I last tried a few months ago)
[06:04] EhevuTov: jaha, I'm currently using Jade and I really enjoy it. I don't do much logic, conditionals in it though. 
[06:04] jaha: i looked at ejs but i was hoping to use a simpler syntax for the time being

[06:06] EhevuTov: davidvip, building isn't much of an issue. There are a lot of testing modules?I'm going to be checking out Mocha (http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/). Deployment?that also can go a couple ways
[06:06] jaha: thepatr1ck:  did you have problems with express? thats what ive been reading, not enough current development on it
[06:06] teslan: thepatr1ck: here is the code with https://gist.github.com/1824150 with comments at 10 and 33
[06:07] EhevuTov: jaha, I think there's an Express 2.0 in the works IIRC it will have better templating
[06:08] norviller has joined the channel
[06:08] EhevuTov: oh wait
[06:08] RexM has joined the channel
[06:08] thepatr1ck: jaha: the issue I had with handlebars and express was that none of the handlebars built-in functions (if/loops) seemed to be there so I ended up have to implement them again in the locals I passed in, which wasn't worth the effort. Things may have improved, I just went with using ejs because it ended up making my templates easier (and even my non-programmer coworkers have no issues with editing those templates)
[06:09] EhevuTov: express is already 2.0?what the heck am I thinking of...
[06:09] r04r has joined the channel
[06:10] EhevuTov: jaha, ah, I'm thinking of 3.0: http://www.devthought.com/code/use-jade-blocks-not-layouts/
[06:10] thepatr1ck: teslan: you're piping from request to r, but by the time you do that request has already fired the end event, so that pipe won't work
[06:10] petrjanda has joined the channel
[06:10] EhevuTov: is it becoming common place to start putting more logic into your views?
[06:11] EhevuTov: or is it still dirty
[06:12] teslan: thepatr1ck: fair enough, now instead of returning out of createServer() is there an equivalent that will also fire that request "end" event?
[06:13] teslan: thepatr1ck: on the subject of "end" events, how do i know that "data" event has ended ? or can it keep on happening until and "end" event fires?
[06:14] thepatr1ck: teslan: it can keep on happening until an end event fires, correct

[06:16] EhevuTov: davidvip, I didn't do much. I wish I could help more. WIth deployment, you might want to think of making private npm package, that way you can install with something like 'npm install <url>' or something like that
[06:16] devaholic has joined the channel
[06:16] teslan: thepatr1ck: where can i find these events explained and is there something like "just-before-end-event" or back to my "return" statement ... in fact are they ok or maybe a bad thing inside createServer() because it by passes 'end' event
[06:16] thepatr1ck: teslan: the way you've done it (if(){â€¦; return}) at the start of the callback makes the most sense to me, otherwise you're buffering the data into memory for nothing
[06:17] kbhit: i'm using node 0.6.10 and hitting the following client js error: GET http://undefined/socket.io/1/?t=1329200144821   when trying to run tutorial http://elegantcode.com/2011/05/04/taking-baby-steps-with-node-js-websockets/ .. any ideas?  i tried subing localhost with http://localhost:2000 etc. and by ip..
[06:17] EhevuTov: davidvip, or even combine it all into a shell script you can 'curl <url.sh> | sh'
[06:17] SamuraiJack has joined the channel
[06:18] thepatr1ck: teslan: you don't need to observe the end event yourself unless you need to do something with it - in this case .pipe()'ing it over to the request library/back to response means you can ignore it for those requests
[06:18] teslan: thepatr1ck: unless i need to buffer it , in order to post it to remote server ... then how would i do it with request module, since it can not go inside of "end" event callback?
[06:18] EhevuTov: davidvip, the npm faq has some interesting tips to make a nice deployment

[06:23] thepatr1ck: teslan: http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/http.html details the various events. and note the request module can go inside an end event callback, it's just not necessaryâ€¦ you could easily just do http.createServer(function(req, res){ req.pipe(request[req.method.toLowerCase()]('http://')).pipe(res); });

[06:25] r04r has joined the channel

[06:27] trupheenix: hi. i want to do high volume streaming using node js. good idea? 
[06:27] kbhit: what format?
[06:28] davidvip: EhevuTov, i think npm might not be so suitable for our closed production environment
[06:28] EhevuTov: davidvip, there's a way to make a private package
[06:28] optixx has joined the channel
[06:29] EhevuTov: davidvip, I haven't done it yet myself, but you might want to see if there's a way to package it up in npm, put the package on your servers, and you can deploy that way, with something like 'npm install <your package url>' I think
[06:29] EhevuTov: davidvip, in other words, make a private package that you don't release to the npm public registry
[06:30] gr4yscale has joined the channel
[06:31] davidvip: EhevuTov, the management would not approve the file sitting outside our own controlled environment although we could mark it as private. Perhaps we need to write shell script to interpret with Mocha output for deployment logic

[12:39] Yester: you want code?
[12:39] robinduckett: Yester: sounds like you're using Chrome
[12:39] robinduckett: Yester: sounds like you're getting a connection with a WebSocket and a FlashSocket
[12:39] Yester: yes i use chrome, is that a bug of chrome?
[12:40] robinduckett: Yester: More likely a bug in socket.io. I have always had trouble with that.
[12:40] Yester: first connection works, then f5 opens 2 sockets, again f5 opens 3 sockets, 4 sockets .. 5 .. 6..

[12:48] maritz: Yester: well, the client side code is more important, because your server isn't the one creating the new connections.
[12:48] peerpeer: maritz: i need to spawn ssh and login with a password. I found nodessh, but it uses expect which shows the password if you type "ps" into the cli. Public private key auth is sadly not an option.

[13:05] Yester: no but i'm new in coding.. have some java knowledge but i now how objects work and stuff^^ i tell you what i want to do: i read out the table groups from a database - then i give this variable (array) to this function where my target is, to create a variable with the name of every group readed out.
[13:05] knite has joined the channel
[13:06] Yester: this variable should be an array. whenever a client connect to the socket, it's do this groupname[0] = socket
[13:07] robinduckett: then have an object with arrays
[13:07] Yester: the reason is i have a file for every group with the content, when the watcher emits it multicast messages to all clients in this group

[13:19] peerpeer: because of clock and mikecronn and their claims. i can't stand it
[13:19] robinduckett: Zack: yeah
[13:19] robinduckett: freenode is exclusively dev orientated, off topic channels are rare and small
[13:19] maritz: Zack: pretty much. some specific projects have their own servers, but that won't help you when searching a general javascript channel ;)

[20:01] megalomix: guys could you give me an opinion of this code? https://gist.github.com/1829717  regarding the lines 28-36  i would like to know if you organize the code in few  inner functions (callback) or you write myFunc(function(err, val){....})
[20:02] Daegalus: megalomix: ya, make the inner functions into named external functions and just call them?
[20:02] lmatteis: Daegalus: right. i was wondering if maybe there was a way to actually deliver a desktop app with its UI being html/css and the server a node web-server... but bundled together so that you don't have to open a browser to use it
[20:02] lmatteis: sort of like a headless browser
[20:02] megalomix: Daegalus, maybe i explain it wrong, take a look at the code i posted
[20:03] megalomix: self.getSymbols(symbols) 
[20:03] sharkbird has joined the channel
[20:03] megalomix: OR self.getSymbols(function(err, symbols){ .... } 
[20:03] Daegalus: lmatteis: there are roundabout ways to do that. ive been searching for a similar solution. Titnium Desktop was the closest i found, but it is under a huge amount restructuring and redevelopment
[20:03] megalomix: only to understand how to organize better my code
[20:03] Daegalus: lmatteis: what you can do is, package it youself. Use Chromium Embedded as the "browser" part, and then run node. Your app will have 2 processes. 1 for node, 1 for the browser part
[20:03] lmatteis: Daegalus: check out tilemill. they seem to do it, and even though their code is open source, it's quite tricky to understand how they do it

[20:06] Daegalus: devaholic: he means a chromeless browser, just a canvas that renders the page. CEF can do that for him

[21:06] spcshpopr8r: I'm looking for a lightweight, stable, mvc-ish kind of thing that works well with postgres...things change so fast in the node.js space, I thought I'd ask here for advice...ideas?
[21:07] EhevuTov: spcshpopr8r, for a web framework or what
[21:07] torvalamo: express is probably what you want
[21:07] cybersyne: locomotive
[21:07] cybersyne: but with couchdb not postgres
[21:08] torvalamo: since you seem like you're new, express is better cuz they have their own channel here
[21:08] spcshpopr8r: EhevuTov: yes web framework
[21:08] cybersyne: it's true

[22:03] diverdude: EhevuTov: yes...maybe ill have to try that
[22:04] EhevuTov: diverdude, socket.io also uses some type of caching to remember what type of transport it uses. I'm not sure if it's a cookie or what
