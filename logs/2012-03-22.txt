[00:01] lsdafjklsd: But the script loader landscape is kind of confusing

[01:04] baudehlo: like do you have a local SMTP server, or are you sending outbound via Gmail (or similar) or do you need a full SMTP server for sending?

[01:11] Tobsn: namecheap.com
[01:11] totallymike: Namecheap is quality
[01:11] Tobsn: and if you need a server for mess around, again i think amazon aws stuff is free for a while and rackspace cloud cost you like 10 bucks a month for a 256mb node which is enough for testing. as well as heroku cost nothing for one web worker

[01:16] sammmy: Okay. So, I install node-email, and use it to connect to my smpt server?
[01:17] sammmy: totallymike: hmm.
[01:17] wizonesolutions has joined the channel
[01:17] Tobsn: sammy, you either use a smtp server (linux default on basically every server is "sendmail") or you use an api like amazons SES, sendgrid, etc. or you use an external sendmail server from a email hoster, which could be your godaddy or gmail account (pop3), for that look up node.js libs related to that
[01:17] totallymike: Don't take that under advisement.  You should not telnet to a remote smtp server.

[01:34] Es0teric: people HAVE to use twitter
[01:34] M4dH4TT3r: lol
[01:34] Es0teric: then WHY have the twitter api available?
[01:34] WarheadsSE: kinda like Apple huh ???
[01:34] M4dH4TT3r: mmmm beer
[01:34] Es0teric: what about apple?
[01:34] totallymike: by use twitter do you mean twitter page?
[01:34] WarheadsSE: jailbreak ? what? NO!! SUE1!
[01:34] Es0teric: look
[01:34] Es0teric: i have my reasons for making this WEB client
[01:35] Es0teric: i just want to know how to actually get a user authenticated
[01:35] totallymike: that's all well and good.  There are plenty of good reasons
[01:35] totallymike: Es0teric: the answer is oauth.
[01:35] M4dH4TT3r: yep
[01:35] Es0teric: totallymike perfect, i USED oauth
[01:35] Es0teric: and it always gives me an error
[01:35] Es0teric: now what?
[01:35] totallymike: now we're getting somewhere
[01:35] Tobsn: https://banters.com/intro - twitter clone made by former twitter employees.
[01:35] WarheadsSE: fix the erro :p
[01:35] totallymike: my car doesn't work, now what do I do?
[01:35] ioscale: Es0teric: use passport-twitter :)
[01:35] M4dH4TT3r: i was wondering what the javascript ext on this room was about though?
[01:36] Tobsn: now with pinterest design. they're getting better hah
[01:36] Es0teric: ioscale passport-twitter?
[01:36] M4dH4TT3r: as i went to #node in relation to hardware and ended up here
[01:37] M4dH4TT3r: ACTION is a hardware geek
[01:37] totallymike: So Es0teric last we left off, you were getting an error message.
[01:37] Es0teric: yeah, totallymike this is when i was using nodejs
[01:37] Es0teric: not express
[01:37] AvianFlu: Es0teric, it's not about "letting ntwitter do stuff".  It's a fork I maintain of a dead twitter api client.
[01:37] M4dH4TT3r: did it say user error: replace user ?
[01:37] ljharb: Es0teric: i'm using sign in with twitter on a node app and it works fine, with passport and passport-twitter
[01:38] AvianFlu: formerly dead, I suppose
[01:38] r04r has joined the channel
[01:38] AvianFlu: making web apps with twitter integration has become very popular

[01:38] TheEmpath2: I'm dealing with a createReadStream and I would like to pipe its contents to a variable.  is this possible?
[01:38] totallymike: These days I don't think they let you call it a web app unless it has twitter integration
[01:39] Es0teric: ljharb are you using the streaming api?
[01:39] TheEmpath2: a better question would be if such a thing is possible with piping in general/
[01:39] jaha: Any idea how to configure the user node.js/express will write files as? I figured it would be the user I installed them as but it is still writting as root
[01:39] Es0teric: just installed passport-twitter
[01:39] ljharb: Es0teric: no, i'm just using sign in with twitter
[01:39] Es0teric: i see

[02:15] ljharb: everything calls layout.ejs, which in turn calls <%- body %> i think
[02:16] rlidwka: require is blocking but it's cached so no problem with requiring inside a route
[02:16] Es0teric: if i dont require inside a route
[02:16] Es0teric: how else am i supposed to require the file?
[02:16] totallymike: Es0teric: was it you in here a while ago trying to figure out why you couldn't get index to use layout as a template?
[02:16] ljharb: Es0teric: you can require outside the route.
[02:16] totallymike: Es0teric: you require it outside the route and call it within
[02:16] Es0teric: totallymike uh… i dont think so
[02:16] totallymike: okay nevermind
[02:17] ljharb: Es0teric: yes, you can. read up on scoping and closures.
[02:17] rlidwka: by the way it's always possible to write up nonblocking require :)
[02:18] Es0teric: ok so i set a <h1> on layout.ejs
[02:18] Es0teric: and no matter what url i go to.. it still renders layout.ejs
[02:18] Es0teric: am i supposed to be putting references
[02:18] Es0teric: from the files i want to load on layout.ejs?
[02:18] totallymike: Es0teric: no
[02:18] ljharb: it will always render layout.ejs. you need layout.ejs to contain "<%- body %>" to render the actual page content
[02:18] Brandon_R: in php you start a mysql connection per request. is that not the accecpted way in node. you start a connection on application bootstrap and use it for all connections
[02:18] ljharb: read the ejs documentation please
[02:18] totallymike: whatever template you want, it wraps layout.ejs around it

[03:04] ljharb: do you have passport and passport-twitter installed?
[03:05] Es0teric: yes
[03:05] Es0teric: right now i actually authenticated myself
[03:05] Es0teric: through oauth
[03:05] Es0teric: but without a login form
[03:05] ljharb: so you have to add two routes, one to passport.authenticate('twitter')
[03:05] Es0teric: i want the user to login through the login form and display their tweets/timeline and stuff
[03:05] ljharb: read the passport docs
[03:06] ljharb: if they are signing in with twitter, you don't have a login form
[03:06] chjj: sammmy: you need a certificate
[03:06] ljharb: their credentials are their twitter account. otherwise you have to build a "connect to twitter" thing which is different than "sign in with twitter"
[03:06] chjj: sammmy: http://nodejs.org/api/https.html and http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html for more info
[03:06] sammmy: chjj: where do I get that? XD
[03:07] broofa has joined the channel
[03:07] chjj: sammmy: you either need to buy one from a certificate authority, or create one and sign it yourself
[03:07] baudehlo has joined the channel
[03:07] chjj: sammmy: the downside to using a selfsigned cert is, browsers go crazy
[03:07] Es0teric: ljharb lets go with the "connect to twitter" thing

[03:08] chjj: sammmy: all of them
[03:08] ljharb: k well i didn't build that, so i'm not sure how - but i'm sure it's similar. although passport isn't likely the way to go
[03:08] sammmy: chjj: what do they do?
[03:08] arthurdebert has joined the channel
[03:08] ljharb: you're building a twitter client - is there a reason to give them other credentials?
[03:08] chjj: sammmy: if youre doing anything in production you probably want to buy a cert
[03:08] hcchien has joined the channel
[03:08] payara: is there an easy way to see which encryption scheme was selected from the SSL negotiation?
[03:08] sammmy: chjj: can you use a purchased cert for both production and development?
[03:09] chjj: sammmy: a cert verifies you as a host, to confirm that a user's connection hasnt been hijacked in any way
[03:09] ljharb: payara: just curious, why do you care which scheme?
[03:09] Es0teric: ljharb what do you mean? no i just want them to connect using their own twitter account/password
[03:09] Es0teric: i would assume thats what 'connect to twitter' is
[03:09] chjj: sammmy: yes
[03:09] chjj: sammmy: if youre just doing development, theres no reason you cant use your own self signed cert temporarily
[03:10] tonymilne has joined the channel
[03:10] sammmy: chjj: I'm doing development right now, but I'm also hosting it on my VPS too
[03:11] Brandon_R: hi
[03:11] ljharb: Es0teric: ok "sign in with twitter" means the only authentication they have is through twitter. "connect to twitter" means they register an account on your server, and connect their twitter account to it.
[03:11] ljharb: "sign in with twitter" is simpler
[03:11] Es0teric: ah right right, yeah so i am going with 'sign in with twitter" then
[03:11] rtgibbons has joined the channel
[03:12] ljharb: then read the passport docs, and they tell you exactly how to do it
[03:12] Es0teric: alright

[03:12] Es0teric: ljharb wheres the gist/
[03:12] Es0teric: ?
[03:12] payara: ljharb: I want to benchmark the different schemes so I need to know which ones are chosen for a connection (some of the clients are from 3rd parties and I don't know what cipherSuites they propose to the server - at least not with packet sniffing I suppose)
[03:12] Es0teric: is it in passport-twitter?
[03:13] ljharb: Es0teric: http://passportjs.org/ ?
[03:13] Es0teric: there we go
[03:13] payara: with->without
[03:13] chjj: sammmy: oh sorry, i didnt see your question right. yeah, browsers go crazy. they just show a big warning page usually.
[03:13] ljharb: payara: hmm, why do you need to benchmark those? that's never likely to be your bottleneck
[03:13] Es0teric: it seems when i installed passport-twitter
[03:14] Es0teric: it installed passport as well
[03:14] sammmy: chjj: browsers only trust certs from paid for institutions?
[03:14] chjj: sammmy: so unless you really need an encrypted connection and dont care about the cert or the user seeing a big warning page, its probably not good to use a self-signed cert.
[03:14] ljharb: its a dependency, so yes
[03:14] wdbl has joined the channel
[03:14] ljharb: sammmy: yes.
[03:14] chjj: sammmy: each OS carries its own collection of certs it trusts
[03:14] ljharb: otherwise any spammer could make their own certificate and defeat the purpose of having them

[03:14] sammmy: I see
[03:15] payara: ljharb: all the publishers and subscribers connect to the same tls server instance
[03:15] ljharb: payara: interesting, ok. why not just support the fastest encryption scheme, if speed is that important?
[03:16] brandwe has joined the channel
[03:17] payara: ljharb: yes, I have played a little with the cipher ordering in the TLS options and managed to change the selected one where I can easily see it (browser) but for the clients that aren't browsers that are done by 3rd parties I don't know what cipher schemes they propose (my understanding is that the client proposes a set of schemes and the server selects the "best" one that matches from that list)

[07:20] Es0teric: you see
[07:21] Es0teric: i would use passport
[07:21] Es0teric: but i just dont understand how it works
[07:21] Es0teric: like.. how would i get the username and password the user inputs?
[07:21] ljharb: you never ever ever get their password. thats against twitter's tos and is stupid.
[07:21] ljharb: and the username shows up in the passport-twitter's profile response
[07:21] Es0teric: im not saying get it like.. save it
[07:21] ljharb: you don't save it.
[07:22] Es0teric: i am saying get it as in authenticate them
[07:22] ljharb: you save a twitter oauth token.
[07:22] Es0teric: thats what i meant
[07:22] ljharb: but you don't need to save it.
[07:22] Es0teric: i know that
[07:22] ljharb: they sign in with twitter, and then you have their twitter ID and username, and that's enough
[07:22] ljharb: you basically just trust that thats who they are
[07:22] Es0teric: anyways
[07:22] Es0teric: like i was saying
[07:22] Es0teric: how do i direct them to the page i specify
[07:23] Es0teric: that allows them to tweet
[07:23] Es0teric: and see their timeline
[07:23] Es0teric: AFTER they;ve been authenticated
[07:23] ljharb: "sign in with twitter" is just the first step. you then have to "connect" to twitter to get the proper permissions to do those things.
[07:23] ljharb: and that you don't use passport for
[07:23] Es0teric: so then after using passport
[07:23] ljharb: and, that, you'd have to save the oauth token for
[07:24] ljharb: in a database or whatever
[07:24] Es0teric: how do you connect

[10:57] TheFuzzball_: I've used node-tds and tedious the same error. What am
[10:57] TheFuzzball_: I missing?
[10:57] erujolc: have you enabled mixed authentication
[10:57] erujolc: in addition have you open up tcp/ip on 3306
[10:58] erujolc: and have you set the server to listen to tcp/ip and not use sql server client helper etc..
[10:58] erujolc: e.g. specify Server=192.168.x.x,1433;Database=
[10:59] TheFuzzball_: Why do I need to open 3306? It's connecting to 1433 by default.
[11:00] TheFuzzball_: And no I don't think I have, I'll give that a shot.

[11:45] vdrab: What is the idiomatic way to process each line of text that comes in through a stream, e.g. stdin? Node currently doesn't seem to provide a way to read a stream line by line, correct?
[11:46] RLa: you you need small layer to buffer incoming data and look for line ends inside it
[11:46] vdrab: I know I can attach a callback to the 'data' event of process.stdin, but then I need to take care of incomplete lines and so on
[11:47] fluk3 has joined the channel
[11:48] maritz: vdrab: yes, that's what you need to do.
[11:48] maritz: but it's not that hard really

[11:48] luismreis has joined the channel
[11:48] RLa: i think you need to use Buffer
[11:49] maritz: vdrab: can you show your slow implementation? :)
[11:49] vdrab: maritz, let's see
[11:49] RLa: but yeah, it might happen that single line is over 100M characters :)

[11:51] MartinCleaver has joined the channel
[11:51] vdrab: Rla: no, it will cut the last line at some arbitrary point, after reading N bytes
[11:51] vdrab: so the version in the pastebin above is incorrect, it doesn't handle the incomplete last line.
[11:52] maritz: vdrab: you do realize that the data event will be called quite a few times, whenever data is available and that it's rather arbitrary what parts are in data?!
[11:52] vdrab: sure
[11:52] vdrab: I assume some other process pipes text in through a unix pipe
[11:52] maritz: with that in mind that implementation should only work on a very limited subset of test cases
[11:53] ovaillancourt has joined the channel
[11:53] ewalker has joined the channel
[11:53] RLa: you should accumulated data received so far in a variable
[11:54] RLa: so when line end comes in you can emit the whole line and clear the accumulator
[11:54] vdrab: RLa: but I cannot keep all data in memory. That's the whole point of using a stream in this case
[11:54] RLa: well, you must
[11:54] vdrab: RLa: oh, ok
[11:54] vdrab: sorry, I misread your comment
[11:54] RLa: you cannot throw away random data between line ends

[12:18] vdrab: booyaa: thanks
[12:18] ckknight: vdrab: a lot is happening that you probably don't realize. For example, the .toString() is converting the bitstring into a unicode text string, then it's splitting that by \n, forming 1 or more strings from that. There are other microoptimizations you can do, such as caching lines.length
[12:18] baudehlo has joined the channel
[12:19] pgte: vdrab: but perl is awesome at text, can't get much faster than that AFAIK
[12:20] ckknight: vdrab: you could do setEncoding("ascii") or "utf8", that will make it convert to a string for you rather than dealing with a data chunk
[12:20] ckknight: yeah, perl always deals with 8-bit strings, for unicode support, you need a library (if I'm not mistaken)
[12:21] pgte: vdrab: yes, reading your pastebin, you have to be careful with multibyte characters
[12:21] pgte: so you should set the encoding on the stream
[12:21] ckknight: I'm curious, vdrab, what is the equivalent perl 1-liner?
[12:21] pgte: so you don't need to call toString
[12:22] vdrab: ckknight: yes, I realize there's a bunch of things going on, I was just wondering why one would have to do all that in js in the first place. the Perls, Rubys and Pythons of this world all have this functionality built-in natively, and are about a magnitude faster for this particular use case. I was hoping to get a nice speedup from using node/V8, but it seems shoveling the data into my program will kill any such goodness...

[12:23] ckknight: if you're just trying to emulate cat, as I think you are
[12:23] vdrab: ckknight: That doesn't split the string into lines, no?
[12:24] ckknight: it'll keep the lines as-is
[12:24] ckknight: it depends on what your actual use-case is
[12:24] simenbrekken has joined the channel
[12:24] vdrab: ckknigth: this is just the IO part of a larger program that processes a large stream of data (think terabytes)

[12:25] dobber has joined the channel
[12:25] vdrab: ckknight: I need to do some string mangling and computation for each line that comes in through stdin
[12:25] ckknight: ah, okay
[12:26] pgte: vdrab: you should implement a duplex stream
[12:26] pgte: vdrab: something that you write to and emits "data" events also
[12:26] vdrab: pgte: you have my full attention :)
[12:26] pgte: and that you can pipe to and pipe from
[12:27] pgte: like process.stdin.pipe(myStream).pipe(process.stdout)
[12:27] pgte: myStream should be called myTransformation, actually
[12:27] vdrab: which is a callback function that does the actual computation?
[12:27] vdrab: I see
[12:28] pgte: vdrab: yup

[13:05] quinnirill: that might be it, the audio backend does weird threading stuff

[13:05] quinnirill: I wonder how I could fix it
[13:05] indutny: quinnirill: it seems to be

[16:38] hex`: there is user property of doc, because before the error I console.log(doc.user) properly
[16:38] slickplaid: does the core ejs module have any way of doing what res.render('filename') does? I basically don't want to have to fs.readFile() to grab the layout, html, etc... is there any way to just output the html that res.render() sends instead of sending it so I can use it internally?

[18:05] isaacs: ag4ve: dnode.connect(blah, blah, function (remote) { remote.doStuff(a, b, c, cb) })
[18:06] ag4ve: yeah, but how do i specify remote?
[18:06] isaacs: micheil: like, people say "global" when really what they mean is one or all of: shared, persistent, exposed
[18:06] dshaw_1 has joined the channel
[18:06] ag4ve: it seems that dnode assumes that the remote will be the server where dnode was included from

[18:06] larsschenk has joined the channel
[18:06] ag4ve: (on the browser anyway)
[18:07] micheil: isaacs: this is for the use case of a "logger" module
[18:07] isaacs: micheil: sure.
[18:07] isaacs: if you *really* want to, you can have the logger register itself on the actual "global" object.
[18:07] micheil: okay
[18:07] isaacs: and set module.exports = global.theRealLogger and return if there's one there
[18:08] isaacs: but that's probably unnecessary
[18:08] larsschenk has left the channel
[18:08] isaacs: or you could set pu a logger service in a separate process space.

[18:09] TheDahv: Or plan on doing more
[18:10] ag4ve: so, if i just say .connect(8000, 127.0.0.1) it'll know what i want, or do i need uri format?

[18:13] ag4ve: TheDahv: off the top, i think browserify has a command line tool if you want an example (since i'm looking at the dnode doc :) )
[18:13] TheDahv: And those are the kinds of things you'd generally install globally with npm, right?

[18:18] TheDahv: So, I'm not using an event loop per se
[18:19] ag4ve: TheDahv: i like perl for command line and generating reports (xls), i like python for all of their math libraries and gis stuff, and ruby for their jruby (just my oppinions of what works for me)
[18:19] jakob_o: tldr > which versions of nodejs and chomium developer tools work together?

[18:51] TheDahv: Ok, a lull in the conversation. So if you're going to install a command-line tool through npm, what would you imagine the experience should be?
[18:52] TheDahv: In my tool, for example, I think it would be cool to just hit "npm install -g link-keeper" and then just go
[18:52] TheDahv: But then what about things like setup? Mine just defaults to chrome because that's what I like on my machine

[18:57] isaacs: TheDahv: you can use the ini module to parse and generate ini files, or just use json
[18:57] yawNO: hi

[18:57] madhums has joined the channel
[18:57] isaacs: TheDahv: also, you can set "preferGlobal":true in the package.json, to nudge people towards installing it globally
[18:58] TheDahv: Oh, I didn't know about that one. I'll toss it in as an issue
[18:58] Es0teric: so i am using formidable and for some reason, i get the error "cannot find module" when i have the package installed via npm
[18:58] itabhijitb: It may be just a fluke but issuing npm -g list followed by npm -f install socket.io just worked. Though I got the message "Checking for node path                   : not found " which I believe can be ignored.

[19:24] ag4ve: putting environment variables in my .zshrc doesn't change either
[19:24] TheDahv: A fair point
[19:24] TheDahv: So does mean bash users are out of luck?
[19:24] TheDahv: I guess environment variables would work the same way

[20:24] warz has joined the channel
[20:24] Es0teric: wait, xat-- so i have to make the form to actually POST to?
[20:24] IrishGringo has joined the channel
[20:25] xat--: Es0teric: yeah, formidable is to save files you send via a mulit-part form
[20:26] Es0teric: so then
[20:26] Es0teric: when i make the form
[20:26] Es0teric: where do i direct it to?
[20:26] xat--: to /bar
[20:26] Es0teric: the directory that the test.js is on?
[20:26] Es0teric: i see
[20:26] xat--: Es0teric: what are you trying todo exactly?
[20:27] Es0teric: xat-- i am trying to make a twitter login
[20:27] Es0teric: via authentication
[20:27] risto_ has joined the channel
[20:27] Es0teric: with username/password fields
[20:28] adambeynon has joined the channel
[20:28] xat--: so someone sends a form to your server with his twitter account?
[20:28] Lemminkainen: Es0teric: you are not alone in form trouble
[20:28] staar2: can the req.flash() object accessed in view ?
[20:28] Lemminkainen: I'm trying to use Formidable to pass form data to Mongo and am having trouble getting the collection.insert to work at all
[20:28] xvacantx has joined the channel
[20:28] xvacantx: Hey everyone
[20:28] Es0teric: xat-- no.. someone logs into their twitter account using my form, then they get a oauth token
[20:28] xvacantx: Anyone here use phantomJS?
[20:28] TheEmpath has joined the channel
[20:29] TheEmpath: hail nodelings
[20:29] Es0teric: then the user will be directed to a dashboard that I create and see their twitter stream/ be able to post a tweet
[20:29] st_luke: xvacantx: i have
[20:29] xat--: okay
[20:29] xvacantx: Cool, every use the nodejs fork of phantomjs?
[20:29] staar2: can the req.flash() object accessed in view (expressjs question) :) ?
[20:29] TheEmpath: my assumption is that if I have var a = new Buffer(); and var b = new Buffer().toString() that b will take up more RAM than a, yes?
[20:30] Es0teric: xat-- now i want to link everyauth with the form info that i'll be getting
[20:30] st_luke: xvacantx: nope!

[20:32] Es0teric: man...
[20:32] Es0teric: even this simple twitter form
[20:32] Es0teric: is a freakin pain
[20:32] Es0teric: lol
[20:32] Es0teric: its not "simple"
[20:32] xvacantx: Yes

[20:32] staar2: Es0teric, what's the problem ?
[20:32] xvacantx: yeah?
[20:33] brianthecoder: who is the one who manages the #node.js twitter account?
[20:33] Es0teric: staar2 i basically want to… make a username/password form, get authentication using everyauth, give the user a token so they can be able to see their twitter feed/post a tweet on the dashboard that i specify
[20:33] xvacantx: I'm using it to gather resources and take thumbnails of websites
[20:34] xvacantx: because you can't fool a browser with obfuscated javascriprt
[20:34] xvacantx: javascript*
[20:34] Es0teric: i will be using the streaming API
[20:34] Es0teric: from twitter
[20:34] Es0teric: to display everything in real time
[20:34] xvacantx: I'm sure Google does the same thing with their own webkit fork
[20:35] staar2: xvacantx, why noy use the jsdom + jquery combo for that ?
[20:35] st_luke: realtime is so yesterday, someone page me when apps run in future time

[20:35] Es0teric: i gotta admit.. creating a REST API in php then pushing the data from the php API into node
[20:36] Es0teric: sounds a lot easier

[20:36] brian_miller has joined the channel
[20:36] xat--: Es0teric: but now you learn cool new stuff :D
[20:36] baudehlo: xvacantx: yes I use node-phantom
[20:36] xvacantx: can that do redirects (javascript/server)
[20:36] brianthecoder: anyone in here use log.io?
[20:36] Es0teric: yeah, xat-- i just want to make this twitter client for myself for now
[20:36] xat--: *gf
[20:36] Es0teric: i will extend it later on
[20:37] Es0teric: xat-- do you know any tuts on accomplishing what i am trying to accomplish?
[20:37] xvacantx: I have to be able to see past url shorteners and redirects
[20:37] xvacantx: and be able to do https
[20:37] xat--: hmm, i dondt have any in mind
[20:38] Brandon_R: does anyone here run node on a cluster?
[20:38] dukeytoo has joined the channel
[20:38] Es0teric: xat-- then how would you go about executing what i am trying to do?
[20:38] Es0teric: lol
[20:38] baudehlo: jsdom can't do page thumbnails, unless you do html2<img> somehow.
[20:39] baudehlo: Brandon_R: like more than one machine you mean?
[20:39] Brandon_R: yeah
[20:39] baudehlo: of course
[20:39] Brandon_R: do you use 
[20:39] Brandon_R: what's that library called, that uses event emitter 2
[20:39] xat--: Es0teric: well, i would first see how that twitter authentication thing works.. because ive never done that.. but i guess you already know how that works :)
[20:39] baudehlo: dnode?
[20:39] Brandon_R: it's at the tip of my tongue
[20:39] mmalecki: Brandon_R: hook.io
[20:39] Brandon_R: nope
[20:39] Brandon_R: yeah :P
[20:40] baudehlo: no I don't.
[20:40] xat--: Es0teric: you get an access token from twitter?
[20:40] Es0teric: yep, xat--

[20:43] Es0teric: MORE PEOPLE NEED TO DO THIS
[20:43] xvacantx: Yeah that was exactly what you were talking about
[20:43] xvacantx: lol
[20:44] Es0teric: lol
[20:44] xvacantx: I figured it would be a useful comparison
[20:44] Es0teric: thanks again xvacantx

[20:49] Es0teric: so then… i would have to save the oauth token of the user
[20:49] Es0teric: and the userID
[20:49] Es0teric: or i can just save the userID
[20:49] ag4ve: so, basically, i want to be able to control client hardware from a server. so i plan to have a local (to the browser) node instance running, and i want to be able to run functions on that instance from the server.
[20:51] ag4ve: so, basically: browser -> server (audit) -> browser (call localhost) -> client server (do something)

[20:52] ag4ve: and of course i need errors to trickle down
[20:55] Es0teric: can someone tell me
[20:55] Es0teric: what Redis is?
[20:55] TheDahv_: It's a flavor of nosql databases, isn't it?
[20:55] dragansah has joined the channel
[20:55] TheDahv_: Very "Key Value" store
[20:55] Es0teric: nosql databases
[20:55] Es0teric: waht?
[20:55] mc: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=what+is+redis
[20:55] TheDahv_: oh
[20:55] TheDahv_: geez. um. Have you heard of mongodb?
[20:56] SubStack: redis only recently got the ability to persist data not in memory
[20:56] Es0teric: mongodb?
[20:56] Es0teric: i only know
[20:56] Es0teric: mySQL
[20:56] SubStack: redis is mostly for storing things like sessions and caches
[20:57] Es0teric: so redis is… a database?
[20:57] ag4ve: heh, he goes from a second rate db to a no db :)
[20:57] isao: redis is like memcached with data structures instead of just key/values
[20:57] Es0teric: ag4ve MySQL is the most commonly used
[20:57] isao: it also does pub/sub and transactional kind of stuff
[20:57] Es0teric: i see
[20:57] ag4ve: and shittiest, but i use it, so....
[20:58] Es0teric: so i'll have to learn it
[20:58] Es0teric: great...
[20:58] kevwil has joined the channel
[20:58] Es0teric: is couchDB the same?

[20:58] Brandon_R_: new idea
[20:58] Brandon_R_: object oriented css
[20:58] Es0teric: Brandon_R_, ever heard of LESS?
[20:58] TheDahv_: Well, there are times when a relational database is the right tool for the right problem
[20:58] Brandon_R_: yeah
[20:58] indutny has joined the channel
[20:58] Es0teric: Brandon_R_ thats kind of OOCSS

[20:59] mikedeboer has joined the channel
[20:59] adrianF has joined the channel
[20:59] ag4ve: yeah, how does that redis pub/sub stuff work? i mean, would i really want that over a mongo stream and faye / juggernaut / etc?
[20:59] Es0teric: anyways
[20:59] TheDahv_: Es0teric: play around with this to get a feel for how nosql can work: http://try.redis-db.com/
[20:59] Es0teric: TheDahv_ i am already there
[20:59] TheDahv_: Oh
[20:59] TheDahv_: I also like this one: http://try.mongodb.org/
[21:00] mmalecki: well, make sure to try out many dbs
[21:00] Es0teric: mongodb is also a noSQL db right?
[21:00] TheDahv_: yeah
[21:00] mmalecki: it's not like nosql is the same everywhere
[21:00] Brandon_R_: mongodb is fast
[21:00] Es0teric: and couchdb is too right?
[21:00] mmalecki: Brandon_R_: yeah, and it's webscale
[21:00] Es0teric: so basically these are cloud type db's
[21:00] Brandon_R_: couchdb is also webscale
[21:01] isao: lol
[21:01] TheDahv_: well, this approach to scaling data out horizontally is useful and attractive in particular scenarios
[21:01] mmalecki: saying that "x is fast" is bullshit unless you link to specific code which executes faster
[21:01] Es0teric: oh
[21:01] Es0teric: so these db's
[21:01] Es0teric: are js based
[21:01] TheDahv_: mmalecki makes a good point that you should strive to understand the strengths and weaknesses of a given database
[21:01] ag4ve: TheDahv_: yeah, but the last project i was in they didn't use an array in a db because it isn't a native value in all rdbms. point being is that nosql might suite many more use cases than it's used for.
[21:01] Es0teric: intresting
[21:01] TheDahv_: given your scenario
[21:01] Es0teric: that makes sense with the k/v pairs
[21:02] boltR has joined the channel
[21:02] SubStack: normalizing all our data can be annoying
[21:02] TheDahv_: I tend to go to mongodb because I like the syntax more than redis. I don't have giant applications that need to replicate their data across the world
[21:02] SubStack: especially when basically every time you want an array you've got to make a new table
[21:03] esundahl has joined the channel
[21:03] Es0teric: so if i do DEL connections (and connections is an array that has multiple key/value pairs… it completely deletes that? 
[21:03] Es0teric: so its like deleting a table in sql
[21:03] SubStack: TheDahv_: those aren't really compatible to compare
[21:03] SubStack: redis is more competing with tech like memcache
[21:03] ag4ve: SubStack: i argued to just use a varchar and shove json in there. they didn't like that idea though, don't recall what was used
[21:03] TheDahv_: You're probably right. I don't claim a full understanding of the whole domain
[21:04] xvacantx: memcache is pretty awesome
[21:04] SubStack: couch and mongo are more comparable
[21:04] TheDahv_: oh ok
[21:04] SubStack: in the problem that they're designed to solve
[21:04] TheDahv_: So redis is more for just jamming anything into it?
[21:04] TheDahv_: arbitrary data
[21:05] Es0teric: so should i use
[21:05] SubStack: redis is more for when you need an in-memory store without too much regard for persistence although it has that now
[21:05] Es0teric: redis or mongodb?
[21:05] SubStack: ...
[21:05] ag4ve: Es0teric: whichever you prefer
[21:05] Es0teric: ag4ve i dont know how to use either
[21:05] Es0teric: but redis seems easier to use
[21:05] warz: your schema will be very different depending on which one you use, and you'll have to jump through additional hoops if you use redis.
[21:05] Wizek has joined the channel
[21:05] Es0teric: based on the tutorial i am doing
[21:05] laner has joined the channel
[21:05] ag4ve: a friend of mine said he had an exploit for redis a year ago. but i never got to see it, so fwiw.
[21:05] Es0teric: dude
[21:05] Es0teric: i just want to store
[21:05] Es0teric: oauth tokens
[21:06] warz: dude rtfm and use your own judgement
[21:06] warz: ok, dude?
[21:06] Es0teric: :o someone doesnt like it when i say "dude"
[21:06] warz: for the past week youve jsut been askign questions that are easily researchable and you disregard input from this channel
[21:06] warz: so why do you keep asking
[21:07] ag4ve: .... i think it's an rtfm at this point
[21:07] TheDahv_: warz is there a channel specifically for noobs? Or is it worth exercising some patience
[21:07] hh__ has joined the channel
[21:07] Es0teric: warz i actually search this stuff… i only ask becuase the documentation aint enough
[21:07] warz: thedahv, it's worth reading about redis and mongodb. the differences are pretty major.
[21:08] TheDahv_: I agree. I don't often hit IRC because I spent plenty of hours wading through search results
[21:08] bandu has joined the channel
[21:08] warz: self research + just try it == way more sustainable than asking on irc
[21:08] Es0teric: warz not true
[21:08] TheDahv_: being a dick, not that useful anywhere
[21:08] kigorus: I am having problems compiling node-v0.6.12 on solaris x86 https://gist.github.com/2162124 any idea how to fix it?
[21:08] warz: sometimes it takes somebody telling you that youre doing it wrong before you realize that youre doing it wrong
[21:08] warz: just saying.
[21:09] TheDahv_: fair point
[21:09] RLa: redis seems quite wasteful of ram if most of your data does not change
[21:09] bodisiw has joined the channel
[21:09] Es0teric: the tutorial on mongodb is alot better than the one on redis
[21:09] hh__: huh
[21:09] hh__: redis doc is pretty good
[21:09] admc has joined the channel
[21:09] warz: redis has good docs. redis is just more simplistic than mongodb.
[21:09] warz: thats why the docs are simpler.
[21:10] ag4ve: RLa: so using a js sub/pub system might still be the way to go?
[21:10] warz: esoteric, use redis if you are just wanting to store oauth tokens and have a reliable key to store them with.
[21:10] alejandromg has joined the channel
[21:10] ag4ve: Es0teric: yes, because mongo fits the js style
[21:11] warz: keep in mind though that as your schema may grow, redis may no longer meet your needs.
[21:11] RLa: ag4ve, hm, no idea
[21:11] Es0teric: exactly, ag4ve thats why i say its alot better because its easier for me to understand
[21:11] hh__: for express, if you have a web site and want to expose a web service api, should you go the rails way and have it be the same route? and then within the route have like a req header that differentiates the response?
[21:11] RLa: i'm not familiar with your app enough to say
[21:11] TheDahv_: Well, mongo deals with "documents", which is a differentiator from something like redis, right?
[21:11] TheDahv_: Err, or is that what makes couch and mongo more similar?
[21:12] warz: it can be. you can store json data in redis as well.
[21:12] ag4ve: RLa: makes ssense.
[21:12] maxogden: mongo is like couch except it doesnt fsync before writes :D
[21:12] warz: mongo has better features for actually understanding it, though.
[21:12] RLa: i see mongodb mosty useful for data that does not fit into ram
[21:13] Es0teric: man, i am lost now
[21:13] Es0teric: lol
[21:13] Es0teric: i am just going to go ahead with this.. tutorial
[21:13] hh__: you seem always lost lol
[21:13] Es0teric: hh__ yeah, but i somehow catch up.. i just get lagging 
[21:13] TheDahv_: Where did this whole conversation start? You're looking to do auth in an application?
[21:14] Es0teric: someone should make a nodejs tut for people coming from a php background man
[21:14] warz: RLa, that's not really why it's "mostly useful". heh.
[21:14] hh__: your php experience seems on the low tbh
[21:14] warz: mongodb has built in map reduce, geospacial indexing, etc.
[21:14] RLa: warz, in comparison to redis :)
[21:14] konobi: warz: and a storage backend of /dev/null
[21:14] Es0teric: hh__ i am not saying i am a pro at php
[21:14] TheDahv_: geospacial indexing is a cool feature
[21:14] hh__: you seem like you're missing a lot of basic programming concepts, like you're trying to go from step1 to step10 and you get frustrated
[21:14] Es0teric: but i am saying its easier for me to understand
[21:14] ag4ve: Es0teric: so you pretty much want ejs with a mysql connector. done
[21:15] TheDahv_: Is it postgre that also does some geospatial stuff in queries?
[21:15] ag4ve: Es0teric: ^^ there's your php to node tut :)

[21:19] Es0teric: TheDahv_ my problem now is… form -> userdata -> authenticate -> recieve oauth token
[21:19] ag4ve: TheDahv_: my point was that they had the example that did what he stated in the git of mongo-auth
[21:19] hh__: so friends, i'm confused, if i have an express route that responds with html or json... aka it also acts as a restful web api, how do i handle authentication? do i check cookies and.. whatever auth i choose for the api ?
[21:19] TheDahv_: where does that project live?
[21:20] TheDahv_: hh__: I put 'middleware' in my routes to handle authentication
[21:20] zenista has joined the channel
[21:21] hh__: but i'm saying is that the right approach or should i separate the routing
[21:21] nathanielk: 2
[21:21] TheDahv_: Heh, so you're asking for opinions and not implementation help
[21:21] nathanielk: >.> nm
[21:21] TheDahv_: Um...man, if I had to venture a guess, I'd say have your routes figure out what the desired content type is and respond from the same route
[21:22] TheDahv_: It might make the code look hairier
[21:22] TheDahv_: But it's nicer from the client perspective
[21:22] Es0teric: ag4ve wheres the git for mongo-auth/
[21:22] Es0teric: ?
[21:22] TheDahv_: Moreover, having an implementation detail in the URL ("/some/route/json-version") seems wrong
[21:23] hh__: rails does it like /post/1.json , which is ugly imo
[21:23] hh__: idk, i was going to make it check a req header for the response format
[21:23] TheDahv_: I know I've seen that, but I think rails also checks the incoming request 'content-type'
[21:24] ag4ve: https://github.com/bnoguchi/mongoose-auth
[21:24] enmand has joined the channel
[21:24] hh__: i'm more concerned about how to auth, so it's common practice to check cookies, or check whatever i use to auth api requests, like auth header token
[21:24] sechrist has joined the channel
[21:24] ag4ve: since i'm here: https://github.com/bnoguchi/mongoose-auth/blob/master/example/server.js
[21:25] zenista: hi guys is this still true that if a single event misbhihaves or crashes it can bring down the whole application (website) ?
[21:25] TheDahv has joined the channel
[21:25] TheDahv: Ooops. Got disconnected. 
[21:25] kriskowal has joined the channel
[21:25] TheDahv: Anyway, I used mongo-auth in an early version
[21:26] hh__: that's true for anything
[21:26] TheDahv: It was using native extensions that made it fail pretty hard when I wanted to deploy to heroku
[21:26] alejandromg has joined the channel
[21:26] TheDahv: Passport didn't have those problems
[21:26] admc has joined the channel
[21:26] sechrist has joined the channel
[21:26] TheDahv: I also like it's "promise fulfilment" style. It feels like continuation passing
[21:27] zenista: hh__ i mean like in php kind of webistes only the users/visitors own session will get crashed but not the whole website for everybody else using it
[21:27] robi42 has joined the channel
[21:27] flou has joined the channel
[21:27] jetienne has joined the channel
[21:27] sechrist has joined the channel
[21:28] Es0teric: you know what? i guess i'll abandon this whole twitter thing i am trying to do.. i'll go more basic
[21:28] zenista: <hh__> i mean like in php kind of webistes only the users/visitors own session will get crashed but not the whole website for everybody else using it
[21:29] TheDahv: Es0teric: that's usually a good plan
[21:29] hh__: i think crash is the wrong term
[21:29] Es0teric: TheDahv i think making a PHP REST API and pushing it to node is alot easier
[21:29] tommyvyo has joined the channel
[21:29] Es0teric: so having node process the information from the api
[21:29] zenista: <hh__> i m totally new to node.js kind of think ... so just worried
[21:29] TheDahv: Heh, oh, I thought you meant "simple" as in not dealing with authentication
[21:29] kevin_jax has joined the channel
[21:29] emperorcezar: using http.request how do I get the response after I call .end()?
[21:30] TheDahv: If you're going to do it that way, I think you're cheating yourself from actually learning the right way
[21:30] ag4ve: TheDahv: you might like this since you use passport (right?) github.com/Turbo87/locomotive-passport-boilerplate/blob/master/app/models/account.js 
[21:30] Es0teric: yeah, TheDahv i dont have to authenticate with this
[21:30] Es0teric: because i am going to make the REST API
[21:30] thetony: is there any demand for sql/nosql connections client side?  that is like the only thing preventing apps from living entirely in a "cloud"
[21:31] zenista: what i mean is like in other web server only the session a particular user is .. will get affected... not the whole websites... is this the case with node.js too or rather node.js stopps respoding to all the users and we have restart it ?
[21:31] ag4ve: it's copied from the bcrypt example, so it should be good ok...
[21:31] thetony: and relying soley on js*
[21:31] hh__: it's the same thing in php
[21:31] TheDahv: I like the idea of pushing the authenticate logic into the model
[21:31] dilvie has joined the channel
[21:31] Poetro has joined the channel
[21:31] TheDahv: In a recent project I did, we had no passwords to store anywhere
[21:32] ag4ve: yeah, i still do mvc without a framework
[21:32] TheDahv: So all the authentication was done by 3rd party oauth modules
[21:32] hh__: like if you missed a semi colon somewhere, it'll affect all your users
[21:32] hh__: sure the process is still running but it's essentially down
[21:32] ag4ve: the only thing i'm missing is a good function that loops through a directory and gives me variables with the same name as the files in that path.
[21:32] perezd has joined the channel
[21:33] TheDahv: The challenge was keeping the concerns separated. Having code dealing with persistence stuff living right next to code concerned with authentication stuff was hard to tease apart
[21:33] ag4ve: then i don't have to require each model
[21:33] hh__: and there are ways to ensure your node process starts back up in the event it goes down
[21:33] zenista: <hh__> thanks buddy any pointers or links for that
[21:33] ag4ve: this isn't a problem yet (as i only have one model), but i think i am about to need a second
[21:33] TheDahv: This is how I did it: https://github.com/TheDahv/BeerAndCode/blob/master/authentication.js
[21:33] tlack has joined the channel
[21:33] arnorhs has joined the channel
[21:34] zenista: <hh__> and do you suggest node.js to be production ready yet... or should i wait... are there any large websites underway on node.js yet?
[21:34] tlack: is there a convention for objects that save/restore their state via json? my object is an inverted index (for searching) and im writing a .toJSON() method.. should the inverse be .fromJSON() (ie var ii = new InvertedIndex().fromJSON(str))
[21:34] jMCg: hh__: as front-end?
[21:34] arnorhs: hh_: i would wait till around 2025 (jk)
[21:34] TheDahv: zenista: for the second question, start by looking on the nodejs home page
[21:35] hh__: instagr.am probably the largest site using node.js i know of
[21:35] TheDahv: Microsoft, ebay, linkedin, yahoo
[21:35] ag4ve: TheDahv: heh cool. bookmarked just in case i need reference for doing other types of auth :)
[21:35] TheDahv: word
[21:35] arnorhs: linkedin's mobile site runs on node
[21:35] TheDahv: I think that when you download a project on github (as a zip file), it is a node process wrapping all that up and responding with your request
[21:36] arduix: http://pastebin.com/MdycjXCt
[21:36] TheDahv: Granted, I read that in a tweet or something
[21:36] arduix: how to get provider_name?
[21:36] TheDahv: ag4ve: What I really like about the way we did it is all authentication stuff is tucked away in that module
[21:37] TheDahv: The routes themselves only know there is an "doAuthenticate" function in the module (I think that's what we called it) and it doesn't care how it works
[21:37] tlack: arduix: x[0].provider_name, no?
[21:37] TheDahv: So I can change auth libraries now and I don't have to make changes in app.js
[21:37] tlack: TheDahv: i just joined, can you link me to the system you're talking about? auth is always my achilles heel
[21:37] TheDahv: https://github.com/TheDahv/BeerAndCode/blob/master/authentication.js
[21:38] arduix: thanks tlack 
[21:38] TheDahv: I run a programmer's meetup in Seattle and we made a site for it: http://seattle.beerandcode.org
[21:38] tlack: i love seeing how other people structure their code! (since im a noob)
[21:38] hh__: you pay for the beer?
[21:38] flou has joined the channel
[21:38] TheDahv: byob
[21:38] hh__: LAME
[21:38] TheDahv: Sometimes people think we're cool and provide beer or pizza
[21:38] TheDahv: The Seattle ruby group gave us a keg once
[21:38] hh__: see how real meet up groups do it
[21:39] fomatin has joined the channel
[21:39] ag4ve: TheDahv: yeah, generally auth is a controller, but.....
[21:39] TheDahv: hh__: You'd be surprised by how unlame it is
[21:39] hh__: i'm just messing with you 
[21:40] hh__: i'm nowhere near seattle :p
[21:40] TheDahv: word
[21:40] SiGe has joined the channel
[21:40] ag4ve: but, because it's middleware and mongodb.... structures sorta change

[21:42] jacobolu_ has joined the channel
[21:43] flou has joined the channel
[21:44] tlack: TheDahv: is there a reason you do some of your configuration stuff (i.e. app.set()) in app.js instead of conf.js? or is it just thats how it wound up? 
[21:44] topfunky: in an express app, I'm setting up the socket.io server in its own file/module. Is it shady to set something like app.settings.socketIO for use elsewhere?
[21:44] topfunky: or should I use a singleton or global or something?
[21:45] topfunky: for the initialized socket server 
[21:45] TheDahv: tlack: mostly the latter
[21:45] TheDahv: It's a moving project and we've got some refactoring to do
[21:45] nibblebot has joined the channel
[21:45] tlack: TheDahv: makes sense, things like that are what im still green about with node
[21:45] michaelhartau has joined the channel
[21:45] TheDahv: So, back when this project first started "the node way" was not really defined
[21:46] TheDahv: For many aspects of application development, there still isn't a rubber-stamped way to do things
[21:46] jacobolus has joined the channel
[21:46] mattparo has joined the channel
[21:46] topfunky: half of the libraries want app.js and the others want server.js
[21:47] TheDahv: But when I started writing things, I think my "template for hooking up mongo to express" used a lot of app.set()
[21:47] gzmask has joined the channel
[21:47] arnorhs: i find that scary.. mostly because i don't know if the framework will introduce settings there that might collide with what i've done
[21:47] arnorhs: imo
[21:47] tlack: i think this is one of those things where im too concerned about style and should just focus on getting the job done, even if it means abusing app.set or w/e
[21:48] TheDahv: topfunky: if you create your "app" variable without the var keyword, it becomes global and you can define things on it from other modules
[21:48] TheDahv: tlack: yeah
[21:48] AviMarcus has joined the channel
[21:48] TheDahv: arnorhs: what is it specifically you find scary?
[21:48] caioketo: mongodb is good database comparing to mysql ?
[21:48] jgaui has joined the channel
[21:48] tlack: you could also pass it into your socketio's init function and then do app.set in there
[21:48] topfunky: TheDahv: ah, good point. Thanks
[21:48] ag4ve: heh, i was thinking of using locomotive, but then i thought about and there's not really anything it adds (imo).
[21:49] tlack: caioketo: they're very very different.. mysql is structured into tables and rows and columns, mongodb is more free form
[21:49] topfunky: tlack: yeah, that's what I'm doing
[21:49] topfunky: tlack: It just felt like app.settings should be configuration, not live objects and servers
[21:49] topfunky: tlack: but maybe that's ok
[21:49] RLa: caioketo, unless you need queries, http://howfuckedismydatabase.com/nosql/

[21:49] bshelton has left the channel
[21:50] kbhit has joined the channel
[21:50] SiGe: caioketo: doesn't really matter
[21:50] ag4ve: for a game, i'd use postgres
[21:50] tlack: caioketo: nosql databases are usually much faster at the expense of taking longer to write queries for (since you do it basically manually, compared to the simplicity and flexibility of sql)
[21:51] hh__: for a game, i'd imagine whatever is low latency/fast writes?
[21:51] RLa: it depends what kind of data you keep in it
[21:51] ag4ve: mainly because i'm thinking that you could geo fense an object and wouldn't have to deal with colisions in code.
[21:51] SiGe: hh__: worst, you implement a redis + sql, so again I believe it doesn't matter whic one you use.
[21:52] thetony: tlack: do people not write sql manually anymore?
[21:52] jacobolu_ has joined the channel
[21:52] pgte has joined the channel
[21:53] tlack: thetony: i meant at a higher level. for instance, with redis, you'd have to iterate over every 'person' to sum up their ages. with sql you would do select sum(age) from people
[21:53] warz: tlack, that makes no sense.
[21:53] SiGe: that's typically what I call a troll question : "whats the best for let me see, a game?" no offense caioketo

[22:19] TheDahv: I haven't gotten a chance to play with it at home yet, but is the point of js-dom to be able to load a DOM into an object? 
[22:19] TheDahv: https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom
[22:19] TheDahv: I think I get what it's trying to do, but it's vague enough that I won't know for sure until I actually download it and try it out
[22:19] TheDahv: Which I can't do at the moment
[22:19] nathanielk: jsdom is awesome.
[22:20] nathanielk: it allows you to do webscraping with jquery in node, for example
[22:20] nathanielk: or unit test browser JS
[22:20] nathanielk: i use it for both of those things, TheDahv 
[22:20] patcito has joined the channel
[22:20] TheDahv: So I could point it at a site and get an object you can investigate in code?

[22:44] topfunky: actually, I just realized that app doesn't set up any data 
[22:45] topfunky: so it's probably not useful without instructions
[22:45] topfunky: but you can run the tests
[22:45] TheDahv: Oh, I think the problem was that Windows was mad about the encryption stuff on the folders and I didn't notice
[22:45] topfunky: do you use node on windows?
[22:46] topfunky: I'm trying now and ran into various problems. No Redis, no libxmljs
[22:46] TheDahv: I do, but in a limited fashion
[22:46] topfunky: express-namespace made weird regexes that it didn't like
[22:46] TheDahv: I don't use npm on node
[22:46] TheDahv: So that really makes things hard
[22:46] topfunky: ok
[22:46] topfunky: I could run a basic app but nothing fancy
[22:46] TheDahv: But that's more a function of how my boss set up the network
[22:46] ryanseddon has joined the channel
[22:46] topfunky: express/socket.io
[22:46] TheDahv: Rather than the fact that is on windows
[22:47] TheDahv: I did get socket.io and express working though
[22:47] TheDahv: Hehehe, it sounds disgusting, but I download the zips and all the dependencies by hand
[22:47] topfunky: Yeah, I just wrote this for someone on Windows https://github.com/topfunky/demo-simplest-socket-io
[22:47] TheDahv: Does npm use git to pull down dependencies?
[22:47] topfunky: no, not git
[22:47] benvie: it uses node only ;)
[22:47] topfunky: npm seems to work well. It installed a bunch of stuff from package.json
[22:47] TheDahv: Oh. Well poop
[22:48] TheDahv: Maybe I should download a version of node with npm installed
[22:48] topfunky: it was the other modules that had problems
[22:48] benvie: it downloads tarballs from npm site
[22:48] topfunky: I just used the Windows installer from nodejs.org
[22:48] TheDahv: thanks for the hotpie code. I'll poke through that
[22:48] benvie: I would recommend using the installer
[22:48] blueadept` has joined the channel
[22:48] benvie: and then using npm
[22:48] TheDahv: Yeah
[22:48] benvie: what's a bigger word than strong
[22:48] TheDahv: I wrote a chat server for my coworkers. They were kind of spooked
[22:49] benvie: I would infinitely recommend
[22:49] thetony: bigger word than strong?
[22:49] benvie: million recommend
[22:49] ag4ve: so, i'm *still* trying to figure out how to connect a web browser to two different dnode or nowjs (don't really care). nowjs is pretty obvious - it connects wherever the file was included from. dnode seems to do the same but has a .connect which might work.
[22:49] benvie: just do it
[22:49] tlack: strongly advise?
[22:49] benvie: but more than strong
[22:49] benvie: like I'd punch you if you don't if I could
[22:49] tlack: emphatically advise
[22:50] ag4ve: however, my bigger issue is namespace in the browser - both of these export their DNode/now variables and don't seem to have a noconflict.
[22:50] TheDahv: We use WatiN and NUnit to do browser automation tests at our company. It's SOOOO slow
[22:50] benvie: http://bbenvie.com/img/htELH.jpg is a similar idea
[22:50] flou has left the channel
[22:50] benvie: I've prepared a thesis in repl. It consists entirely of punching you in the face
[22:50] TheDahv: If I could write tests against an arbitrary site with a node process
[22:50] TheDahv: I'd love to give that a shot
[22:51] recur has joined the channel
[22:52] ag4ve: so, i've got some ideas as to how to get around this (namely just using socket.io and have the browser run string.init() ) but i am hoping for an easier way?
[22:52] ag4ve: (and a better way)
[22:52] topfunky: TheDahv: I thought about that. My tests just use mikeal's request module.

[23:12] yaymukund: it would be nice to write something like iced on top of an async library like Step
[23:12] mehale: ah... is there a default path for modules?? strace shows node looks modules everywhere
[23:12] yaymukund: that would make the JS output cleaner
[23:13] mehale: should I put them at my app´s directory?
[23:13] tlack: yaymukund: hmm..
[23:13] TheDahv: node looks in node_modules in your application directory first
[23:13] TheDahv: And then on up the chain
[23:14] mehale: ok, just added all modules locally! first time using it... sorry!
[23:14] TheDahv: npm should just install things locally by default

[23:18] jaha1 has joined the channel
[23:18] tlack: TheDahv: it seems common for people to package up their node_modules folder when they're moving their stuff around (i.e., from test into production, or to a coworker, etc), even checking node_modules into their version control system
[23:19] tlack: TheDahv: which at first was bizarre to me but now i really appreciate. are you not doing that?
[23:19] TheDahv: Nah. I've read arguments on either side
[23:19] TheDahv: The reason I don't is because I tend to focus on what makes deploying work
[23:19] mehale: TheDahv: moving to another host
[23:19] tlack: well i think its easier to deploy that way as well (one less thing to worry about)
[23:19] TheDahv: Geez. There was an article about this recently too. Dependency management

[23:22] tlack: yeah its definitely a tidier package that way, but still.. i wrote my software to work against a certain version of a module, which means it really is tied to my code; why pretend otherwise just cuz it was written by someone else?
[23:23] bradleymeck has joined the channel
[23:23] TheDahv: In what way does specifying the exact version for each dependency not achieve the same thing?
[23:23] TheDahv: And, to be honest, I'm not really super tied to either method
[23:23] tlack: i guess we have different priorities. i don't think the advantages of your approach are worth the extra effort.
[23:23] TheDahv: I've just always done it the package.json way
[23:24] tlack: fuck it, who cares. :p bigger fish to fry
