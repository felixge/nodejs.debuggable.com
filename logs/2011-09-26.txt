[02:05] elliottcable: well, for my purposes, the isolation doesn’t matter as much; but as I recall, any code *below* a `with()` is maaaassssively slowed down, because it can’t be compiled in the same way
[02:05] elliottcable: and I’m wondering if the same is true of vm’d code
[02:06] micheil: well, if the code running in a VM contains with()'s then I guess it'd have the same affect

[05:58] isaacs: davidbanham: npm ls
[05:58] davidbanham: isaacs++
[05:58] v8bot_:  davidbanham has given a beer to isaacs. isaacs now has 5 beers.
[05:58] isaacs: davidbanham: or `npm ls -g` if it's a global install
[05:58] davidbanham: Thanks, npm ls was exactly what I needed. I'd been beating my head against npm info for a while.
[05:58] isaacs: davidbanham:  you've probably got other questions too, if you're new to this.  check out `npm faq`
[06:00] davidbanham: isaacs: Thanks, very helpful. I've read in the past and forgotten what was in it, then forgotten about it's existence too.

[06:01] Predominant: Is there a way to have node load in all files from a directory, and register the objects as handlers for events?
[06:01] Predominant: Sort of self-registering event handlers.
[06:03] jmoyers: sure, why not.
[06:04] jmoyers: Predominant http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.12/api/fs.html#fs.readdir + EventEmitter + a map to callbacks from the modules
[06:04] Predominant: Hmmm
[06:05] Predominant: I guess if I can read the FS, and require() stuff, then I could have each handler define its event to listen to.
[06:05] jmoyers: could come up with a naming convention that mapped back to events. module.exports['eventName'] = function(e){}
[06:05] Predominant: and then addListener for that event after requiring
[06:05] Deegie has left the channel
[06:05] Predominant: Might be easier to just have a variable in it that I can reference.

[09:25] DrMcKay: a meta and db design question: in mongodb, posts (like on fb wall) should go to separate collection or should they be, like: entity: { wall: [{post}, ...]} ?
[09:25] Industrial: Looking at http://expressjs.com/guide#error-handling, I now have a few error handlers (ApplicationError with children InternalServerError, BadRequestError, UnauthorizedError, NotFoundError). How do I make these globally available in the app?
[09:26] sfoster has joined the channel
[09:26] Industrial: DrMcKay: I'd say stick em in the user collection (erm, entity)
[09:27] DrMcKay: Industrial: we have different entities that can have a wall, so entity is valid here ;)
[09:28] Industrial: DrMcKay: using Mongoose by chance?
[09:28] DrMcKay: Industrial: yup
[09:28] Glenjamin: Industrial: i'd just make an exceptions.js as part of your project
[09:29] Glenjamin: and require it when needed
[09:29] DrMcKay: Industrial: also, to answer your question, app.error is the way, I think
[09:29] rmzg: DrMcKay: If you're expecting large numbers of posts, don't embed them
[09:29] Industrial: Glenjamin: that means doing a require in 20-50 files again
[09:29] DrMcKay: rmzg: that's what we hope for :D
[09:29] Glenjamin: explicit > implicit
[09:29] Glenjamin: also, why does it say to do "NotFound.prototype.__proto__ = Error.prototype;" ?
[09:30] rmzg: DrMcKay: I'd guess the cutoff is somewhere around 1k+, but having embedded arrays kinda sucks for stuff
[09:30] Glenjamin: assert.js in core does that too, you can't do AssertionError.call because of it
[09:30] littlebiged has joined the channel

[09:31] rmzg: And searching is hard and stuff
[09:31] DrMcKay: rmzg: thanks :)

[09:32] Industrial: this however works fine
[09:32] Industrial: a=new Schema({name:String}); b=new Schema({myA: [a]})
[09:32] Industrial: It is thus assumed that relationships are one to many and I can't have a one to one
[09:32] DrMcKay: Industrial: yes, it's a known problem, there's an github issue for it, I think
[09:32] Industrial: DrMcKay: yes, I made it and it got closed. I was told to use DBRef's instead
[09:33] Industrial: but I dont agree with that
[09:33] Industrial: I'm not going to create a collection for every one to one relationship I have
[09:33] DrMcKay: DBRef != embeeded document

[09:34] DrMcKay: I'll look into mongoose and see if it's possible to make it sane

[10:25] Nuck: Instead of require.paths, how about the ability to provid our own resolver?
[10:26] Nuck: (just for the current process)
[10:26] DrMcKay: Nuck: monkey-patch require.resolve?\
[10:26] Nuck: DrMcKay: Is that even possible?
[10:26] Ned_ has joined the channel
[10:26] DrMcKay: Nuck: sure, should be
[10:26] Nuck: And how badly would it break shit?
[10:27] Nuck: https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/1125 oooooh
[10:27] Nuck: I likey
[10:27] augustl: what's the use case?
[10:28] Nuck: augustl: Well, in my case, I keep having to do '../../lib/thing.js'
[10:28] Nuck: And it's getting really irksome
[10:28] augustl: how so?
[10:28] DrMcKay: Nuck: in case it doesn't use it, just monkey-patch require
[10:28] Nuck: I'd like to just to 'lib/thing.js' and set my project root as the current directory
[10:28] Nuck: augustl: Uh, it means I can't move files?
[10:28] DrMcKay: Nuck: but you really don't need it
[10:29] Nuck: How could that *not* be irksome?
[10:29] augustl: do you move files around a lot?
[10:29] Nuck: augustl: Hell yeah
[10:29] augustl: and if you move files you need to alter requires anyway
[10:29] Nuck: augustl: Yes, but I'd rather not have everything relative to the location of file X
[10:29] Nuck: I'd want it relative to the root of my project
[10:29] Nuck: the current directory at startup
[10:30] augustl: how and where would you define that?
[10:30] augustl: perhaps it could traverse up the tree for a package.json
[10:30] Nuck: augustl: That would be ideal, yeah
[10:30] Nuck: Then I wouldn't configure at all
[10:30] Nuck: I was just thinking the ability to replace require's resolver would be the simplest solution
[10:31] Nuck: But looking for package.json would absolutely be the nicest
[10:31] DrMcKay: Nuck: I did monkey-patch require once...
[10:32] DrMcKay: Nuck: https://github.com/mmalecki/dmkbot/blob/master/lib/modules/eval-jail.js
[10:32] Nuck: Somebody add package.json-based resolving and send a pull request :P
[10:32] Nuck: Preferably somebody who signed the paperwork haha
[10:32] augustl: I don't understand why relative requires is a problem though
[10:33] augustl: perhaps a solution is to not move your files around so much (really)

[10:33] DrMcKay: ahh, jheusala :D
[10:33] Nuck: You don't see the problem until you have a bigass project
[10:34] augustl: Nuck: I have a bigass project
[10:34] augustl: Nuck: I could argue that patching require is a workaround
[10:34] Nuck: augustl: Not big enough obviously. ../ does not scale
[10:34] augustl: Nuck: you're missing the point, it's subjective
[10:34] augustl: I have a big project, I don't move files around a lot

[10:34] v8bot_:  DrMcKay has given a beer to augustl. augustl now has 1 beers.
[10:34] Nuck: augustl: patching require would allow subjectivity

[10:36] augustl: subjectively altering a programming environment can cause big pains when it comes to maintainability as well
[10:36] augustl: so it's not just gains
[10:36] augustl: think C++ and Ruby operator overloading etc
[10:36] Nuck: augustl: It can, but if you're gonna remove everything evil, you're doing it wrong
[10:37] augustl: what do you mean?
[10:37] jheusala: DrMcKay: what?
[10:37] Nuck: augustl: Some things can be used for evil

[10:37] Nuck: overloading require's resolve makes it a pain in the ass
[10:37] augustl: my point is simply that given the environment as it is today, the best solution is probably to not move files around as much
[10:38] Nuck: augustl: I don't move around much

[10:39] Nuck: I like that suggestion
[10:39] augustl: if my_requirer is in NODE_PATH, there'll be no relative paths
[10:40] augustl: that's good, because you'll see my_requirer and look for it, instead of wasting time figuring out why 'require' has changed behaviour and where that code lives etc
[10:40] Margle has joined the channel
[10:40] Nuck: augustl: How about not doing require-overloading or wrapping, and just providing pacakge.json resolution?
[10:41] Nuck: face it, Node and NPM are one and the same now
[10:41] Nuck: ACTION points to node_modules
[10:41] Nuck: That's what happens when NPM and Node mate.
[10:41] Nuck: It's not so bad
[10:41] augustl: for the reasons stated above, I would prefer a wrapper to overriding behaviour of existing functions
[10:41] vcm has joined the channel
[10:41] Nuck: augustl: I didn't say overloading, I meant built in to node itself

[10:42] augustl: less shit to misunderstand
[10:42] Nuck: And then when you hit that, try resolving down
[10:42] Nuck: Consider that as the "project root"
[10:43] DrMcKay: Nuck: but why, really?
[10:43] jldbasa has joined the channel
[10:43] Nuck: DrMcKay: Because it means we treat projects a lot better
[10:43] Nuck: And require() can be way cleaner
[10:43] Nuck: And more maintainable
[10:43] Nuck: And because we need to encourage large projects
[10:43] Nuck: We're growing well beyond module-making
[10:44] DrMcKay: Nuck: I have quite a large project. it's all in 3 directories
[10:44] Nuck: The Node community has been making modules and very few actualy full sites for a while
[10:44] Glenjamin: large projects = collection of smaller decoupled modules
[10:44] Glenjamin: in an ideal world
[10:44] DrMcKay: Glenjamin++
[10:44] v8bot_:  DrMcKay has given a beer to Glenjamin. Glenjamin now has 1 beers.
[10:44] Nuck: Glenjamin: Things can't always be decoupled like that
[10:44] Nuck: Sadly
[10:44] Nuck: Plus, all the more reason
[10:44] Nuck: I can't use node_modules like that
[10:44] Nuck: Much less with a thing like heroku
[10:45] er1c_ has joined the channel
[10:45] augustl: Nuck, Glenjamin: collection of smaller and decoupled modules is how I solved the organizational problems of my large project ;)
[10:46] Nuck: Seriously, my big project is well over 20 files, in 5 directories
[10:46] Nuck: And they are all based on modules for interaction
[10:46] Nuck: augustl: Okay, seriously, it rarely works that way
[10:46] Nuck: In an ideal world, everything would be modular
[10:46] Nuck: In the real world, we slap people like you.
[10:46] Nuck: :I
[10:46] augustl: Nuck: I hear ya, but you aren't really saying anything about anything
[10:47] augustl: I can confirm that getting the abstractions right takes lots of hard work though
[10:47] Nuck: A project is not a collection of modules
[10:47] Nuck: At least, not one that was built for the user and not for the programmer
[10:47] Nuck: We want things that are decoupled
[10:47] Glenjamin: a project is some code which ties together a collection of modules
[10:47] augustl: code built for the user and not for the programmer? What does that mean?
[10:47] Nuck: The user wants things that are tied together very tightly
[10:47] Nuck: With a rivvon
[10:47] Nuck: *ribbon
[10:47] Nuck: And a bow
[10:48] augustl: the user doesn't care about the code though..
[10:48] Nuck: augustl: They care about the end result
[10:48] Glenjamin: patterns emerge, refactor and abstract
[10:48] augustl: Nuck: yes they do
[10:48] Glenjamin: improves code quality and maintainability
[10:48] Glenjamin: everyone wins
[10:48] augustl: Nuck: my point is that the end result is not the smae as the code
[10:48] Nuck: And if you program it modularly, the end result will seem detached and in pieces
[10:48] Nuck: I can tell you that from experience.
[10:48] augustl: Nuck: your experience is worthless, then
[10:48] Nuck: I've been on both ends of that
[10:48] augustl: I can tell you otherwise, also based on experience

[10:49] Nuck: Programmers never understand UX
[10:49] augustl: Nuck: easy for you to say
[10:49] Nuck: There's a reason UX experts exist.
[10:49] augustl: also very easy for you to assume that I don't care about UX
[10:49] Nuck: augustl: Yeah, I'm not a programmer by trade.
[10:49] Nuck: Well, I am
[10:49] Nuck: Sorta
[10:49] Nuck: I'm a designer, technically
[10:49] augustl: the code doesn't have to be 1:1 with the UX
[10:49] Nuck: But I do programming more nowadays
[10:49] augustl: the UX and the code are two entirely different things
[10:49] Glenjamin: UX has nothing to do with how you organise code
[10:49] Glenjamin: it should be decoupled!
[10:50] chjj: nuck: is there a reason they make filthy filthy amounts of money?
[10:50] augustl: Nuck: but it's hard, really hard
[10:50] vcm has joined the channel
[10:50] Nuck: Glenjamin: You decouple parts of your site from eachother, they're gonna feel separate
[10:50] augustl: Nuck: abstracting code takes lot of dedication and practice
[10:50] augustl: Nuck: utterly and entirely wrong
[10:50] Nuck: chjj: Designers or UC experts?
[10:50] cnu_ has joined the channel
[10:50] chjj: ux people
[10:50] Glenjamin: Nuck: I don't decouple parts of the site, I abstract shared bits out
[10:50] Nuck: augustl: Not really, it's naturally that way
[10:50] Glenjamin: which leads to decoupling
[10:50] Nuck: chjj: Because UX is something everyone thinks they know, and true UX guys are rare
[10:50] Glenjamin: and DRY
[10:50] Glenjamin: and so on
[10:50] augustl: Nuck: some things are very abstractable. Take databases, for example
[10:51] augustl: Nuck: you abstract them into models etc
[10:51] Nuck: Glenjamin: I share bits too
[10:51] Nuck: augustl: Did I ask about abstractions?
[10:51] Nuck: Didn't think so
[10:51] Glenjamin: decoupling is what emerges from good abstractions
[10:51] Nuck: I mentioned decoupling, abstractions are a whole other thing
[10:51] augustl: Nuck: you made claims and I disagree, hehe
[10:51] DrMcKay: Nuck: decoupling <=> abstraction5~
[10:51] augustl: Nuck: so no you didn't ask about abstractions
[10:51] Nuck: abstractions are used in decoupling, but they are not interchangable
[10:51] Glenjamin: anyway, I have actual work do to
[10:52] Nuck: Seriously, though, all I want is a fucking project-root resolution
[10:52] augustl: Nuck: my message here is that perhaps a better solution would be to decouple and abstract and all that
[10:52] Nuck: Because it's grown to where my chunks (even my reusable modules I've abstracted out) are not good
[10:52] Nuck: augustl: That's the cause of my hell
[10:52] Nuck: I have pulled many pieces out
[10:52] Nuck: And it's modular with shared database and backend
[10:53] augustl: perhaps you could put stuff in separate node packages
[10:53] augustl: and give each one an API
[10:53] augustl: that way all you get is an absolute require with function calls.
[10:53] Nuck: augustl: Doesn't work like that, things rely on shared interfaces through require() caching
[10:53] augustl: there's probably lots of things like that you can do, that solves the problem of having lots of relative requires
[10:54] Nuck: augustl: cool, did you already forget the thing about "workarounds"
[10:54] augustl: Nuck: I got the impression that you're an inexperienced programmer, is that correct?
[10:54] Nuck: I don't want something to monkey-patch this
[10:54] Nuck: augustl: Nope, been doing this for 10 years now
[10:54] augustl: I see
[10:54] augustl: what do you mean about 'did you already forget the thing about "workarounds"'?
[10:55] Nuck: augustl: I mean, I don't want another workaround
[10:55] Nuck: the ../ is the best workaround I've got
[10:55] Nuck: What I want is a project root
[10:55] Nuck: I will not settle for anything less
[10:55] Nuck: And I'm not refactoring my codebase for some bullshit reason
[10:55] augustl: wether or not something is a solution or a workaround is also subjective, I guess
[10:55] augustl: imo, modularizing is not a workaround but a good solution
[10:56] Nuck: Modularizing doesn't work for everything
[10:56] augustl: I realize that
[10:56] Nuck: The Node community needs to recognize the fact that modularity isn't the One True Way.
[10:56] Nuck: Quite often you'll need shared dependencies
[10:56] augustl: Glenjamin and I don't represent the node community ;)

[10:58] Glenjamin: rails 2 was monolithic
[10:58] Glenjamin: rails 3 is modular
[10:58] Nuck: Or will it be a long-term thing, like PHP
[10:58] Glenjamin: eugh
[10:58] Nuck: Will it last us 10 years of steady usage?
[10:58] Glenjamin: do not hold PHP up as shining example of anything
[10:58] Nuck: Glenjamin: Haha, I'm saying it lasted
[10:58] Nuck: It sucks
[10:58] Nuck: But it survived.
[10:59] chjj: pffft, you guys...im waiting for node.dart, whos with me?!
[10:59] augustl: Nuck: I'm not so sure of that
[10:59] Nuck: Because it was Really Fucking Easy™ to use it.
[10:59] chjj: ;p
[10:59] Glenjamin: exactly
[10:59] Glenjamin: really fucking easy = bad thing
[10:59] Nuck: Glenjamin: Not necessarily
[10:59] Glenjamin: minimum entry requirement for writing maintainable code as a decent developer
[10:59] Glenjamin: anyone can hack together a script, then hack stuff over the top of it
[10:59] Nuck: PHP was Really Fucking Easy™ in a way that was detrimental to the code
[11:00] Nuck: Ruby too was beloved for being Really Fcuking Easy™/
[11:00] augustl: this is dangerous. Two or three examples doesn't tell us anything useful.
[11:00] Glenjamin: but the plural of anecdote is data!
[11:00] chjj: ruby had too much of a feminine name i think, everyone knows programmers value manly names
[11:00] augustl: C is fucking hard and is still used a lot, for example.
[11:00] Nuck: The reason Paul Graham touted lisp as amazing?  Because it made things Really Fucking Easy™ to develop.
[11:00] augustl: or C++
[11:01] Nuck: augustl: C is used because relative to Assembly, it's Really Fucking Easy™
[11:01] ph^ has joined the channel
[11:01] Glenjamin: Nuck: i was under the impress that it was also because it was a bit harder to learn, so only smart people did

[11:01] Nuck: augustl: So, yes, it makes perfect sense.
[11:01] augustl: Nuck: what makes perfect sense?
[11:01] Nuck: Glenjamin: Well, that too
[11:01] Nuck: augustl: C is easier than ASM, therefore it gained a lion's share of the market
[11:02] Nuck: And since everyone knows it, it became standard.
[11:02] Nuck: Plus, it's common practice to write code in the language the OS is in
[11:02] medice: mm.. if people like masculine sounding programming languages, i should develop a language called perkele
[11:02] Nuck: Windows programs in C/C++, Mac OS X apps in Obj. C, etc.

[11:04] mdz has joined the channel
[11:04] mdz has joined the channel
[11:05] Nuck: augustl: Well, I have my code modularized, but the modules all depend on eachother, it's a very interlinked system, since most of my modules are chunks of routes for Express, etc.
[11:06] Nuck: However, I have a lib folder that contains my data, and I guess I could modularize some of that stuff out, but other parts rely on things two layers back and two layers in another folder
[11:06] augustl: when is relative requires a problem? Only when you move files?
[11:07] Nuck: It's a problem because I'm havin to do zillions of ../
[11:07] augustl: so is it a typing speed problem?
[11:07] DrMcKay: lol
[11:08] augustl: my curiosity is genuine :)

[11:11] Nuck: Oh god, @philo23 and I are going back and forth making NodeJS + Old Spice Guy jokes on twitter
[11:12] Glenjamin: especially when you make a new module, and c&p from an existing one for the structure
[11:12] augustl: Glenjamin: ah
[11:12] Glenjamin: I find it comes up more often in test suites

[11:17] Nuck: You know what'd be great?  Instead of resolving for package.json, why doesnt' Node just check all paths against the current directory from the launch of the process?
[11:18] Nuck: Simple, obvious, easy.
[11:18] elliottcable: so, I ask for alpha testers for it, and nobody’s interested
[11:18] augustl: Glenjamin: gitorious.org/buster
[11:18] elliottcable: but now we’re talking about the topic again, and everybody wants to weigh in
[11:18] elliottcable: <insert rage comic face>
[11:18] augustl: Glenjamin: it's pretty much finished for the node.js part so you can 'npm instal buster' now actually
[11:18] Nuck: So 'lib/thing.js' resolves to the current directory + 'lib/thing.js'
[11:18] codely: some extremely weird (to me?) behavior -

[11:19] elliottcable: git iteself works with anything, and anywhere

[11:19] codely: I'm using an myArray.search in a chunk of code in a method right. well, if i define Array.prototype.anyNameAtAll … my code borks in my .search
[11:20] Nuck: Github is nice because of Github Issues and Pull Requests.
[11:20] augustl: and I don't care too much for the github community
[11:20] elliottcable: and that *isn’t* distributed, so it’s very important.
[11:20] elliottcable: Issues, pull requests, comments, forks
[11:20] codely: anyone using anything but github = retarddded

[11:21] Nuck: augustl: lol
[11:21] codely: i mean honestly powered with people that think funny like that how can you go wrong?
[11:21] augustl: what I mean is that you have to maintain your own fork on github.com
[11:21] Nuck: augustl: In fact, Github billed them as "async"
[11:21] augustl: and manualyl delete it after the pull request is accepted/rejected
[11:21] codely: i am excited about node **about** to become the #1 watched on github
[11:21] augustl: with a patch in mail you can just clone to your machine and e-mail it, and be done
[11:21] augustl: you don't need to maintain a centralized fork on a website
[11:21] Nuck: augustl: Oh, I agree that's a tad silly on that, but I don't mind it much

[11:24] DrMcKay: Nuck: but still, github ftw
[11:24] Nuck: DrMcKay: When we have more money, chances are we'll be switching to Github

[11:28] pyrotechnick: Nuck: you're missing his point

[11:30] augustl: and that's the point

[14:00] DrMcKay: bradleymeck: obvious one would be to monkey-patch toString
[14:01] DrMcKay: bradleymeck: and seems like it's the only one :(

[14:01] DrMcKay: no, here actually: https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/buffer.js#L408
[14:02] DrMcKay: that one was a SlowBuffer

[14:08] DrMcKay: Glenjamin: proper solution
[14:09] cying has joined the channel
[14:09] DrMcKay: Glenjamin: Buffer would have an array of custom encodings

[14:12] DrMcKay: actually, not `this`, I think...

[14:26] brianc has joined the channel

[17:44] necromancer: what
[17:44] isaacs: necromancer: local installs are the default now.
[17:44] necromancer: lol
[17:44] isaacs: just use "install"
[17:45] necromancer: oh..
[17:45] isaacs: necromancer: also, update to npm 1.0.30
[17:45] necromancer: umm
[17:45] isaacs: ircretary: inst necromancer 
[17:45] ircretary: necromancer: `curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh` (or, if there are permission issues, you can try: `curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh`)
[17:45] necromancer: i'm using homebrew, so is it gonna install the binary to /usr/local/bin?
[17:45] DrMcKay: necromancer: don't.
[17:45] isaacs: necromancer: don't install npm with homebrew
[17:45] necromancer: what

[17:46] isaacs: just make sure to `brew update` a lot
[17:46] isaacs: homebrew doesn't update its index automatically.
[17:46] necromancer: well yeah that's why, because it keeps track of node updating
[17:46] isaacs: since it's all local
[17:46] necromancer: right, the formula maintainer needs to do that
[17:47] robertfw has joined the channel
[17:47] necromancer: so will `npm install` read my package.json?
[17:47] isaacs: nono, even if the formula maintainer pushes a new version, you won't get that by re-running `brew install node1

[17:48] DrMcKay: isaacs: search for express
[17:48] megalomix: isaacs, i tried to search "express"
[17:48] necromancer: thanks isaacs
[17:48] megalomix: there is not express package

[17:52] isaacs: hughfdjackson: either pull npm from github, where the fix is, or use node 0.4, or wait maybe a day or two

[17:53] isaacs: oh, whoops
[17:53] hughfdjackson: oh wow, you'd already responded .. sorry!
[17:53] sdwrage: hughfdjackson: in a browser, the head object is window
[17:53] hughfdjackson: :P you're fast
[17:54] isaacs: fixed
[17:54] sdwrage: meaning you can do var test = "test" and it is added to global scope of window.test
[17:54] isaacs: "head object"?
[17:54] Morkel has joined the channel
[17:54] isaacs: sdwrage: oh, you mean, a global object?
[17:54] hughfdjackson: sdwrage: i think you're mistaking me for someone else
[17:54] sdwrage: isaacs: yes
[17:54] hughfdjackson: i was asking about npm adduser :D
[17:54] isaacs: sdwrage: it's called "global"
[17:54] broofa has joined the channel
[17:54] gregmoreno has joined the channel
[17:55] sdwrage: isaacs: ah.. I read it as head in "Javascript Enlightenment"…. they referred to it as both
[17:55] sdwrage: global and HEAD 
[17:55] hughfdjackson: that one's new to me
[17:55] sdwrage: lemme find a snippet
[17:56] tmilewski: Hey all, I'm having an issue with http.request.  I'm passing options to http.request with an encoded url as a parameter but http.request seems to be decoding the url before making the request and it's causing some issues. What am I missing here? Thanks!
[17:56] tmilewski: Here are the options: var opts = { host: 'api.facebook.com', port: '443', path:   '/restserver.php?method=links.getStats&format=json&urls='+encodeURIComponent(product.canonical_url), method: 'GET' }
[17:56] sdwrage: isaacs: "JavaScript code, itself, must be contained within an object. As an example, when crafting JavaScript code for a web browser environment, JavaScript is contained and executed within the window object. This window object is considered to be the "head object," or sometimes confusingly referred to as "the global object." All implementations of JavaScript require the use of a single head object."
[17:56] CoverSlide: javascript itself is a language independent from the browser. the browser is simply one of the most popular implementations of javascript. outside of the browser, there's no such thing as <head>
[17:56] CoverSlide: i have never heard it referred to as a "head object" before
[17:56] hughfdjackson: why is it confusing to refer it to the global object, i wonder
[17:56] lz: lol
[17:57] hughfdjackson: o.o head object is frakin confusing
[17:57] lz: by that argument all languages must be contained within "objects"
[17:57] hughfdjackson: at least global describes the scoping properties of it
[17:57] sdwrage: hughfdjackson: doesn't really matter. as long as we know what we are talking about here. the object that wraps all of your js logic up into itself
[17:57] sdwrage: basically
[17:57] jesusabdullah: YOU're an object!
[17:58] sdwrage: its true!
[17:58] hughfdjackson: :D totally agreed, sdwrage!

[18:02] sdwrage: seems node.js has a global Object object
[18:02] sdwrage: that wraps up all of the code
[18:02] sdwrage: odd
[18:02] zastaph has joined the channel
[18:02] tilgovi has joined the channel
[18:02] tilgovi has joined the channel
[18:03] sdwrage: go to node, type var = "test", then type this.test 
[18:03] hughfdjackson: Object object is the signature of all objects in js
[18:03] hughfdjackson: if that makes sense
[18:03] sdwrage: hughfdjackson: that is true… but if you type "this" into node, you will get back {}
[18:03] sdwrage: an object literal
[18:03] sdwrage: ;)
[18:03] sdwrage: so, it seems, all code in node.js has a global object that is an object literal
[18:04] sdwrage: that is why this.test works
[18:04] sdwrage: :)
[18:04] tbranyen: well yeah
[18:04] hughfdjackson: curious and curiouser
[18:04] tbranyen: until es6 this is always an object
[18:04] Muvin has joined the channel
[18:04] sdwrage: tbranyen: I was trying to figure out if node.js had a particular user object that they were using
[18:04] sdwrage: thats all 
[18:04] sdwrage: :P
[18:05] tbranyen: just look in the code
[18:05] sdwrage: much like how browsers have window
[18:05] tbranyen: sdwrage: global
[18:06] sdwrage: tbranyen: I just had people arguing in different channels, stating that node.js does not have a global object. I was just trying to make the point that js logic must have at least one global object to wrap it up within
[18:06] tbranyen: global is pretty much a global object
[18:07] navaru: sdwrage:  this does not refer to the 'global' object, this refers to a local object
[18:07] dash has joined the channel
[18:07] Muvin: question about Mongo- Node.js,   let say my node.js server is running and connect to Mongodb.   if I all of the sudden mongo is disconnected (or stop), and I restart mongo. node will not connect to the new MOngo process, unless I restart node server. is there a way to handle it automatically?
[18:08] Muvin: or simply i have to write a script to handle that.
[18:08] navaru: sdwrage: if you create a module and add 'var = 12 ' when you load your module the this.var won't be global is local to that module
[18:08] Nuck: Okay, somebody wanna help me figure out formidable + connect-form? https://gist.github.com/6dca627b6d529290f41a
[18:08] Nuck: Parsing error
[18:08] Nuck: Same result no matter tha upload
[18:08] jmoyers has joined the channel
[18:08] sdwrage: navaru: of course, because this refers to the object that contains it. 
[18:09] sdwrage: navaru: but if you did console.log(var), you would get the var
[18:09] DrMcKay: isaacs: I'm hacking on npm in orded to have something like `npm version v0.1.2 -m 'Commit message'`, but only args that gets passed is version number
[18:09] sdwrage: because that var is now global
[18:09] DrMcKay: isaacs: or hold on, I think I fucked up
[18:09] navaru: sdwrage: only in that module, so basically you don't have a global object in node like 'window' in browsers
[18:09] isaacs: DrMcKay: the -m will be on npm.config.get("m")
[18:10] isaacs: DrMcKay: but it'd be better to add a "--message" config option, then make "-m" a shorthand for "message"
[18:10] sdwrage: navaru: we do have a global object though. It just cannot be referenced is all
[18:10] DrMcKay: isaacs: yeah, I just found out
[18:10] sdwrage: navaru: JavaScript code, itself, must be contained within an object. As an example, when crafting JavaScript code for a web browser environment, JavaScript is contained and executed within the window object. This window object is considered to be the "head object," or sometimes confusingly referred to as "the global object." All implementations of JavaScript require the use of a single head object.
[18:10] stagas_: sdwrage: no in the browser var foo in the outer scope will go to window.foo but in node it doesn't go to global
[18:10] sdwrage: The head object is set up by JavaScript behind the scenes to encapsulate user-defined code and to house the native code with which JavaScript comes prepackaged. User-defined code is placed by JavaScript inside the head object for execution. Let's verify this as it pertains to a web browser.
[18:10] isaacs: DrMcKay: sounds like a good idea.  Configs are defined in lib/utils/config-defs.js, and must be documented in alphabetical order in doc/cli/config.md
[18:10] DrMcKay: isaacs: OK, it'll look like that
[18:11] sdwrage: stagas_: hrm lemme play with that
[18:11] isaacs: DrMcKay: there's a lot of other examples to follow
[18:11] sdwrage: I didn't know node.js modified how js worked at its core
[18:11] vguerra has joined the channel
[18:11] stagas: sdwrage: in node each file is wrapped in a function scope
[18:12] adambeynon has joined the channel
[18:12] sdwrage: stagas: so each file has its own… sort of mini-global per file?
[18:12] TomY has joined the channel
[18:12] navaru: sdwrage: local scope
[18:13] stagas: sdwrage: no there's a global, but you only reference it with global.foo or you omit 'var' and it goes to global
[18:13] DrMcKay: isaacs: but this means that I have to know alphabet.
[18:13] DrMcKay: oh.
[18:13] DrMcKay: not good.
[18:13] sdwrage: stagas: okay see that is what I was making sure of
[18:13] DrMcKay: no, actually, wikipedia <3
[18:13] sdwrage: that nodejs has a global that wraps the code up basically
[18:14] sdwrage: or else that book has a lot of explaining to do
[18:14] sdwrage: :P
[18:14] hughfdjackson has left the channel
[18:14] isaacs: DrMcKay: "M" is between "L" and "N"
[18:14] navaru: sdwrage: what book?
[18:14] sdwrage: navaru: "Javascript Enlightenment"
[18:14] DrMcKay: isaacs: yeah, thanks :)
[18:14] sdwrage: navaru: JavaScript code, itself, must be contained within an object. As an example, when crafting JavaScript code for a web browser environment, JavaScript is contained and executed within the window object.

User-defined code is placed by JavaScript inside the head object for execution. Let's verify this as it pertains to a web browser.
[18:14] sdwrage: that is the snippet from it
[18:14] isaacs: DrMcKay: so, put it between "long" and "node-version"
[18:15] DrMcKay: isaacs: I'll make it false by default
[18:15] Muvin: anyone knows any node module for analyzing log file?  like Splunk?
[18:15] sdwrage: navaru: "All implementations of JavaScript require the use of a single head object" being the kicker
[18:15] DrMcKay: isaacs: or should I use some format string?
[18:15] apoc has joined the channel
[18:15] ippz: anyone have pointers to how to remove GC-runs like this: http://pastie.org/2595374 .. it currently kind of kills my realtime game 
[18:15] stagas: sdwrage: the closure thing happens in js land, it's the way we have module.exports and such stuff so you can imagine it's in a (function () { ... your code ... })()
[18:16] torgeir_ has joined the channel
[18:16] isaacs: DrMcKay: So, the type def should be [null, String], and the default should be null.  then, when you're using it, if it's set to null, use whatever is currently the default.
[18:16] stagas: sdwrage: with some vars passed in like module, require, global, process I think
[18:16] isaacs: DrMcKay: i think a format string is probably going overboard for this feature

[18:19] stagas: sdwrage: this is cool because this way you can have vars in every file of yours but none of these will leak in global, so you don't need an extra closure like you do in the browser

[19:26] DrMcKay: uhm. third lua node?
[19:26] DrMcKay: Nuck: that's understandable
[19:26] DrMcKay: Nuck: we've tried to build our private cloud

[19:27] Nuck: They're a small business, but they've served us well
[19:27] DrMcKay: we're now wondering how should we connect those mainframes to make them a cloud
[19:27] Nuck: DrMcKay: We generally use continuous-feed tape loops
[19:28] DrMcKay: I think we should just put some steam emitter into our server room

[19:48] dylang: tjholowaychuk: Doodle or Die is going well now that we moved mongo off no.de, getting about 2 doodles saved per second right now.  i think we could be faster if we use cluster but in my tests i get "FATAL ERROR: CALL_AND_RETRY_2 Allocation failed - process out of memory" on startup.

[19:49] tjholowaychuk: hmm.. it shouldn't try to compile .css files

[19:49] DrMcKay: Nuck: then hackers would be able to just get all Linux machines at once!
[19:49] dylang: tjholowaychuk: i merge all the styl files together into one file using assettmanager because it handles wildcards.
[19:49] DrMcKay: that's why my company will always stick to IBM Unix
[19:50] isaacs: CoverSlide: yeah, 128
[19:50] isaacs: CoverSlide: they're really not intended for production use
[19:50] tjholowaychuk: dylang hmm, i usually just have one root .styl file so they're already aggregated really
[19:50] Nuck: DrMcKay: Linux!?  Who does he think he is, copying the name from IBM Unix!?
[19:50] dylang: tjholowaychuk: 2/doodles saved per second - each one is then uploaded to amazon s3.
[19:50] isaacs: we have smartmachines up to 40GB of ram for that
[19:50] DrMcKay: Nuck: oh, true... I think I will call IBM tomorrow.
[19:50] Nuck: isaacs: But they can go pretty far, as `3rdEden proved.

[19:58] tjholowaychuk: i haven't tried either haha
[19:58] isaacs: dylang: actually, the port that you ssh into is through an ssh tunnel
[19:58] tjholowaychuk: should work though

[22:24] konobi: tjholowaychuk: connect middleware to do reverse proxying on a per route basis
[22:24] tjholowaychuk: nope
[22:24] tjholowaychuk: you could probably combine connect and node-http-proxy

[22:51] ryanrolds_w: Epeli: node-gd will be able to handle that, but it may have more functionality then you're looking for
[22:52] tjholowaychuk: Epeli check out aheckmann/gm
[22:52] tjholowaychuk: unless you need pixel-level editing or are already using node-canvas you kinda might as well use those libs
