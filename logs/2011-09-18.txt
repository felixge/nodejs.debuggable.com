[00:00] bnoordhuis: oh, in that case make sure the Pointer object points to a memory arena of at least sizeof(Persistent<Value>)
[00:00] navaru1 has joined the channel
[00:00] qbert65536: does node have any general case forums ?
[00:00] TooTallNate: bnoordhuis: good point. do you think unsigned char* is too small?
[00:00] locksfree has joined the channel
[00:00] bnoordhuis: then *reinterpret_cast<Persistent<Value>*)(p->GetPointer()) = new Persistent<Value>(value)
[00:00] bnoordhuis: TooTallNate: quite likely
[00:01] TooTallNate: that's probably it then, cause the code I posted earlier couldn't be too off
[00:02] bnoordhuis: qbert65536: the nodejs mailing list
[00:02] abjorn has joined the channel
[00:02] qbert65536: bnoordhuis, ok I'm going to make a forum then, do you think people would use it if it was not built in node ?
[00:03] bnoordhuis: TooTallNate: sorry, typo: *reinterpret_cast<Persistent<Value>*)(p->GetPointer()) = Persistent<Value>(value); // no need to new
[00:03] JerrySpringer: Just a question, What is a legacy release? 
[00:03] bnoordhuis: TooTallNate: but really, you should turn it into a struct
[00:04] bnoordhuis: qbert65536: why a forum?
[00:04] TooTallNate: bnoordhuis: that's just not possible
[00:04] mynyml has joined the channel
[00:04] smathy has joined the channel
[00:05] qbert65536: bnoordhuis, easieer to search / navigate in my opinion
[00:05] visnup: TooTallNate: oooh, k
[00:05] bnoordhuis: TooTallNate: sorry, typo'd again:  *reinterpret_cast<Persistent<Value>)(p->GetPointer()) = Persistent<Value>(value); or  *reinterpret_cast<Persistent<Value>*)(p->GetPointer()) = new Persistent<Value>(value);
[00:05] visnup: TooTallNate: any hope of a fix in 0.4?
[00:06] chapel: qbert65536: that is debatable
[00:06] chapel: did you even know about the mailing list?
[00:06] bnoordhuis: but constructs like that are a pain to manage and debug, don't say i didn't warn you
[00:06] TooTallNate: visnup: idk you'd have to ask bnoordhuis or one of the other comitters
[00:06] qbert65536: chapel, im on the mailing list yeah
[00:06] chapel: okay
[00:06] chapel: google searches it fine
[00:06] chapel: and there is search built into the group
[00:07] jamescarr has joined the channel
[00:09] TooTallNate: bnoordhuis: is Persistent<Value> a typedef to a pointer though?
[00:09] TooTallNate: sounds like no
[00:10] bnoordhuis: TooTallNate: no, it's an object
[00:10] bnoordhuis: c++ object that is
[00:10] TooTallNate: so then it seems like i'd rather store the &Persistent<Value>(value)
[00:11] TooTallNate: no?
[00:11] maushu__ has joined the channel
[00:11] TooTallNate: and then in getObject() deref that address back to the Persistent<Value> object?
[00:11] bnoordhuis: that construct wouldn't work and besides, you'd be taking the address of a stack based object
[00:12] cody-- has joined the channel
[00:12] bnoordhuis: as soon as you leave the function in which you do that, that object ceases to exist
[00:12] TooTallNate: right
[00:12] bnoordhuis: in a nutshell: you need to allocate storage space somewhere and maintain a pointer to it
[00:12] TooTallNate: ok I was doing it wrong cause I thought that Persistent was the same size as a pointer
[00:12] cody--: does anyone here use heroku to host their node apps
[00:12] TooTallNate: bnoordhuis: that's what the Pointer object DOES
[00:15] bnoordhuis: TooTallNate: yes, but you never did tell if the area m_ptr points to was large enough
[00:15] TooTallNate: indeed, but that's up to the user: new Pointer(1024) alloces 1024 bytes
[00:15] TooTallNate: and that's what m_ptr points to
[00:16] cody--: anyone know if I have to use the redis-url module to connect to the redistogo heroku offers, or can I use node_redis?
[00:17] cadorn_001 has joined the channel
[00:18] TooTallNate: bnoordhuis: the other functions on the object (putDouble(), putInt32()) use memcpy
[00:18] bnoordhuis: TooTallNate: and?
[00:19] TooTallNate: well just what's the proper way to assign the Persistent<Value> to the space that m_ptr points to?
[00:20] scooby has joined the channel
[00:21] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[00:21] scooby: hi, quick question. I have installed node and npm. where should i install my npm modules?
[00:23] bnoordhuis: TooTallNate: *reinterpret_cast<Persistent<Value>*>(self->GetPointer()) = Persistent<Value>::New(value)
[00:23] bnoordhuis: that will create a persistent handle and copy it into the space m_ptr points to
[00:23] TooTallNate: bnoordhuis: perfect that worked :)
[00:25] TooTallNate: bnoordhuis: you rule dude, thanks again!

[03:15] jamescarr: yep
[03:15] jamescarr: are you an attendee?
[03:15] brainproxy: awesome, see you there
[03:15] jamescarr: cool
[03:16] jamescarr: Hopefully it's not too introductory for you :)
[03:16] brainproxy: someone who couldn't make it gave me their ticket
[03:16] jamescarr: ah
[03:16] brainproxy: so I'm now in the Loop!
[03:16] brainproxy: ;)
[03:16] jamescarr: hehehehe
[03:17] brainproxy: well i may have seen a lot of it before, but I'm obviously into node, so it will be fun to participate
[03:17] brainproxy: i could try to help those around me who get stuck too, and I'm interested to see what you show us wrt mongo integration
[03:17] jamescarr: yeah, I hope it's not too lame :)
[03:17] jamescarr: I basically put together a simple express app
[03:17] jamescarr: using an in memory collection
[03:17] chjj: LAME
[03:17] chjj: jk ;p
[03:18] jamescarr: and have the students migrate it to mongoose, then add validation too
[03:18] brainproxy: sounds cool .. i run the STLJS meetup and folks were asking for an intro to express presentation
[03:18] brainproxy: so maybe this will give me some ideas :D
[03:18] jamescarr: yeah, I ran the node.js group in St.Louis last year, but we only had two meetings
[03:18] jamescarr: unfortunately, I had to move back to Columbia after forming it
[03:18] jamescarr: a shame too... we had a good turn out
[03:19] brainproxy: STLJS is getting good numbers
[03:19] brainproxy: enthusiastic group; 75 signed up iirc, and about 30 show up at a time for the meetups
[03:20] jamescarr: nice
[03:20] jamescarr: I have a group in Columbia that gets about 30 members on average

[03:33] jamescarr: cool
[03:33] jamescarr: that's how it starts
[03:33] jamescarr: mostly in the REPL in the beginning
[03:33] brainproxy: back in August I attempted an "intro to node" presentation for stljs and flubbed it up because I spent too much time lecturing and trying to build a foundation for understanding event loop and whatnot
[03:33] brainproxy: the attendees told me later I should have just jumped more into to the examples

[03:34] chjj: bah, people get bored too easily

[04:05] ericmuyser: chjj: i think some stuff i needed was removed in latest 0.5 :)
[04:05] chjj: either 0.5.7 or 0.4.12 would be good

[04:26] bronson: couch or redis?  that's like asking if you want to buy a sports car or a truck.

[04:29] rurufufuss: I guess its more couchdb vs mongodb then?
[04:29] jamescarr: rurufufuss, what about Riak?
[04:29] chjj: if you like terribly ugly query syntax, mongo is for you
[04:29] jamescarr: neo4j? Tokyo Cabinet?
[04:29] rurufufuss: risk reminds me of kopi luwak from the name
[04:30] levi: It's all about mysql. :P
[04:30] rurufufuss: riak*
[04:30] chjj: levi: its all about webscale
[04:30] chjj: levi: /dev/null is webscale
[04:31] levi: Well, I'll use that in my next project then!  It's sure to win.

[04:32] chjj: bronson: did i say any did?
[04:32] skiz: what sql is pretty syntax? heh
[04:32] rurufufuss: I wonder why there's a video of two bears on youtube talking about mongodb vs mysql
[04:32] brainproxy: khmer: regarding hosting options, for *most* general purpose you could just get a linode or some other linux vps
[04:32] chjj: go with couchdb if you want to use a database developed by a person who hates node.js
[04:32] khmer: haha
[04:32] bronson: chjj, no, but I'd hoped there was a point to what you were saying!
[04:32] khmer: i'm not sure what that says about that person
[04:33] chjj: go read damien katz's blog
[04:33] chjj: he criticizes node all the time =/
[04:33] levi: I'm guessing there's not a lot of overlap between erlang fans and node.js fans?
[04:33] mikeal has joined the channel
[04:33] khmer: chjj: right but i'm saying i'm not sure what that says about the software
[04:33] chjj: bronson: i dont make points about databases
[04:33] khmer: i'm doing plain key-value CRUD, really nothing relational at all
[04:34] chjj: khmer: ok
[04:34] chjj: khmer: ...
[04:34] khmer: but this is my first experience using a non-sql db in production, it just seemed like the right fit
[04:34] brainproxy: khmer: does it need to be persistent, i.e. saved to disk ?
[04:34] khmer: yeah definitely
[04:34] chjj: im not saying it says anything about the software, never did
[04:34] chjj: why do people keep putting words in my mouth tonight?
[04:35] bronson: khmer, if all you want is key-value, go Redis.
[04:35] Aphelion: chjj: it's all they can put in there from over the internet.
[04:35] Aphelion: thankfully.
[04:35] chjj: ACTION is scared.
[04:35] khmer: chjj: if i wanted to put words in your mouth, i'd say them in a high, mocking voice, while opening and closing my hand in the manner of a chatty duck
[04:36] khmer: chjj: i was asking about the software, not the creators
[04:36] bronson: if you want more advanced queries, indexing, map/reduce, etc, mongo or couch should work.
[04:36] skiz: (and full text search to boot)
[04:36] bronson: and I been meaning to play with riak one of these days...
[04:36] chjj: khmer: i didnt even see you ask anything, i wasnt necessarily speaking to you when i said that
[04:36] pandark_ has joined the channel
[04:36] levi: Redis is a memory-based store, though, so don't go with it if you have a lot of data and not much RAM in your VPS.
[04:37] chjj: khmer: do whatever you want, i just felt like talking trash about damien katz
[04:37] brainproxy: yeah, if persistence is a high-priority and your available RAM isn't so large, redis probably isn't the answer
[04:37] brainproxy: persistence meaning persistence on disk
[04:38] khmer: ah, so redis isn't persistent. i am clearly unschooled here
[04:38] bronson: yes it is
[04:38] khmer: i just thought it was another competing key-value store
[04:38] brainproxy: well yes, it can save to disk
[04:38] WRAz has joined the channel
[04:38] brainproxy: i mean it does, but you should think of the db as primarily being an in-memory thing
[04:38] khmer: for scale, i am basically modeling toggle switches
[04:38] brainproxy: err db = kv store
[04:38] khmer: string key, boolean value
[04:38] skiz: use a cookie?
[04:39] khmer: but they need to persist globally
[04:39] levi: Redis keeps a backup of your data on disk, so it's fully persistent, but the whole thing is also kept in RAM.
[04:39] skiz: always worth a thought :)
[04:41] khmer: no, thanks
[04:42] khmer: oh all right. yeah i don't know what redis is doing under the hood, but if it's storing efficiently in RAM at all, and not doing some BISON thing, then it seems like an okay fit
[04:43] skiz: just be aware that a complete request doesn't mean committed to disk.
[04:43] binaryjohn has joined the channel
[04:43] levi: Redis has multiple ways of doing persistence, actually.
[04:44] levi: They offer some speed/safety tradeoff.
[04:44] skiz: right, I guess I should have said it needs to be configured to match your needs
[04:48] devaholic: chjj: i can swap out vanilla for express?
[04:49] levi: It actually sounds like a pretty good fit if you're just storing a bunch of boolean values.  You could model it as a set of 'switches that are on' and maybe a set of all switches if you need to check if a switch that is not in the on set is in the set of all switches.
[04:50] sivy has joined the channel
[04:51] chjj: devaholic: well, it has similar functionality, its my personal framework though, i dont guarantee everything will stay the same or be stable 100% of the time
[04:51] levi: Does anyone here have much experience with socket.io?
[04:52] khmer: levi: hmm! yeah, i think i'll try redis. as long as i can run it on whatever node host i pick
[04:52] khmer: i'm not anxious to try doing node on a dreamhost vps
[04:52] chjj: devaholic: oh, you mean in my blog?
[04:53] brainproxy: khmer: what's your concern about using a vps?
[04:53] chjj: devaholic: uh yeah, the api is very similar, it should be possible, thats why it designed it the way i did
[04:53] devaholic: oh okay, im just more familiarwith express
[04:53] ericmuyser: neither 0.5.7 or 0.4.12 wants to build (mac osx). libz link errors. maybe my LD_LIBRARY_PATH is screwed up? http://paste.ubuntu.com/692075/
[04:53] levi: I think a lot of hosts with explicit node support will have redis available as well.
[04:53] brainproxy: ericmuyser: maybe try building/installing on mac w/ nvm .. works for me

[04:54] brainproxy: node version manager
[04:54] chjj: devaholic: well it should work, there are small differences in how routing is done, you might have to add an express middleware that parsed the path and gave you an array containing the path structure on the request object
[04:54] ericmuyser: wtf'ing awesome, thanks
[04:55] brainproxy: nvm install v0.4.12 ... downloads, compiles, installs node, d/l & install npm w/ it

[04:56] brainproxy: khmer: i've had some good experience w/ running node, etc. on linode vps
[04:59] khmer: brainproxy: a linode would be great, but it seems a little pricey
[04:59] toreym has joined the channel
[04:59] brainproxy: khmer: true, could be especially if you're not making good use of the bundled bandwidth allowance
[04:59] brainproxy: rackspace cloud servers (not cloud sites), which are basically the same thing as linode vps, charge for bandwidth a la carte
[05:00] brainproxy: so if you're not using much bandwidth, your monthly cost could be around $10
[05:00] khmer: that's more like it
[05:00] khmer: for a stupid art site i'm making
[05:01] brainproxy: khmer: http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/servers/
[05:01] brainproxy: cheapest option is $10.95/month .. just remember that the b/w charges will be tacked on at the month's end
[05:03] khmer: that IS a good price, but it's clearly aimed at businesses trying to scale
[05:03] khmer: this is more of a hobbyist thing.
[05:03] khmer: or am i being too nitpicky and this is what hobbyists do?
[05:03] brainproxy: i don't see why a hobbyist couldn't use a vps from rackspace
[05:03] brainproxy: but maybe I misunderstood your point
[05:05] jamescarr: khmer, Amazon EC2 has a free option if you're looking to experiment
[05:06] jamescarr: http://aws.amazon.com/free/
[05:06] brainproxy: yeah, that could be a cheaper way to start

[07:44] tmzt: the problem is static returns  function
[07:44] Druid has joined the channel
[07:44] tmzt: middleware is just a function (req, res, next)
[07:45] tmzt: so jus tuse app.get('static/:path', static('fspath/'))

[08:59] shanebo: mape, so I could make the route, '/javascripts/min.js' ?
[09:00] mape: shanebo: yeah, you can enter any regex
[09:00] shanebo: mape I guess I'm confused why you would use a regex if the result is one file :)
[09:00] mape: shanebo: because then you can add a hash in the url and bust caches
[09:01] shanebo: mape also does your module respect import within a stylesheet?

[09:16] lovesh: visionmedia-express-2.4.3-146-gd3937b9.tar
[09:17] lovesh: but why does that fail?
[09:17] shanebo: this is slick mape :) thanks man
[09:17] lovesh: i have the complete source of express
[09:17] DrMcKay: yeah, the problem is that npm needs internet connectivity to fetch dependencies
[09:17] mape: shanebo: :)
[09:18] lovesh: ok
[09:18] lovesh: so is there some way i can install it offline
[09:19] japj: as long as there are no binary modules, you could install everything on an online machine and then copy all the files it installed
[09:19] DrMcKay: what japj says
[09:19] japj: depending on the amount of dependencies, doing things by hand is going to be a pain
[09:19] DrMcKay: npm install express on online machine
[09:20] DrMcKay: and copy the node_modules directory
[09:20] piscisaureus__ has joined the channel
[09:21] DrMcKay: meh, npm *should* support it
[09:21] vguerra has joined the channel
[09:21] DrMcKay: like npm pack --deps 
[09:22] lovesh: i am on windows right now but have curl,wget and git installed can i download the complete source of express here and install on linux?
[09:23] japj: you can also use ryppi to install if npm doesn't work for you on windows
[09:23] Slashbunny has joined the channel
[09:23] japj: although it works slightly different (and is written in python)
[09:23] japj: https://github.com/japj/ryppi
[09:23] lovesh: @japj i dont have node or npm installed on windows
[09:24] lovesh: is there some way i can fetch all dependencies from github?
[09:24] japj: lovesh: ryppi is implemented in python
[09:24] lovesh: ok
[09:24] japj: lovesh: and it will fetch all dependencies
[09:25] tyrion-mx has joined the channel
[09:26] DrMcKay: btw, does `npm pack --deps <package>` packing package together with dependencies sound sane?
[09:26] DrMcKay: ACTION wants to contribute to npm
[09:27] tyrion-mx: is "process.binding" documented somewhere?
[09:27] tmzt: nodejs.org ?
[09:27] tyrion-mx: I can't find anything
[09:27] shanebo: mape since connect doesn't have gzip baked in anymore, what do you use? Ever used this module? https://github.com/nateps/connect-gzip
[09:28] tyrion-mx: I'd like to understand what "var SlowBuffer = process.binding('buffer').SlowBuffer;" does
[09:28] stagas has joined the channel
[09:28] japj: DrMcKay: that looks sane to me ;)
[09:29] DrMcKay: japj: great, thanks :)
[09:29] navaru has joined the channel
[09:29] japj: tyrion-mx: I think process.binding is an internal part of nodejs

[09:29] mape: shanebo: I haven't actually used it, gziping was a pita before
[09:29] tyrion-mx: it says it's something private and should not be used
[09:30] mape: but they landed some nice stuff lately, that isn't in stable though
[09:30] arnee has joined the channel
[09:30] japj: tyrion-mx: I think it is the 'bridge' between the internal stuff that is implemented in C++ and the javascript api for those
[09:31] tyrion-mx: I asked that, because I wanted to understand the buffers.js module, but I couldn't find those this.*Slice methods
[09:32] japj: tyrion-mx: the C++ part for buffers is at https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/src/node_buffer.cc
[09:32] lovesh: @japj if i have a linux box with internet connection can i use ryppi to fetch all dependencies of express or other modules?
[09:32] tyrion-mx: japj, thank you, but I am too noob to read C++ :)
[09:33] HektoR has joined the channel
[09:33] matjaz has joined the channel
[09:33] japj: lovesh: yes, ryppi uses the internet to fetch all dependencies, so as long as you have python you can run ryppi.

[09:53] wee: because if I dont I get npm ERR! Error: EACCES, Permission denied, Please use 'sudo' or log in as root to run this command.
[09:54] japj: wee: is that because the node_modules directory is owned by root?

[10:12] TheJH: HektoR, that's not really how you should do it
[10:12] HektoR: TheJH, so how to do it ?
[10:13] TheJH: HektoR, you COULD use a global for that, but it's kinda ugly
[10:13] japj: or make a function in the module and pass it the variable
[10:13] HektoR: TheJH, yeah, i don't want to use global, that why i'm asking for alternative ways 
[10:14] TheJH: HektoR, japj, or <advertisement>use my cool library: https://github.com/thejh/node-context </advertisement>
[10:14] TheJH: HektoR, have a look at test.js
[10:14] TheJH: HektoR, I am pretty sure it'll work cross-file, too

[10:15] TheJH: true
[10:15] HektoR: japj, you right. but when you have many files which must communicate to each other it's kinda confusive ...
[10:15] TheJH: I should write it
[10:15] HektoR: TheJH, okay ... let me see
[10:16] DrMcKay: is there a possibility for npm -g to install things in user directory?

[10:17] TheJH: DrMcKay, only when your npm install is local to the user, too - well, actually, there's a neat trick with which you can do it

[10:47] onethirtyfive: I'm writing a little express.js app. In one of my route definitions, I'm trying to have jsdom load some markup. I want to include some scripts, so I'm using jsdom.env. However, since it jsdom.env uses an async callback function, the 'connect' middleware sends response headers before the jsdom callback gets called. Has anyone dealt with this kind of problem before?

[10:51] DrMcKay: did someone say 'global'?
[10:52] DrMcKay: I'm pretty sure that someone said global.

[10:53] TheJH: DrMcKay, you can just write "global.foo = 1"...
[10:53] DrMcKay: TheJH: it's bad. I mean, it hurts.
[10:54] DrMcKay: TheJH: and global module is kinda lulzy
[10:54] DrMcKay: it uses module cache and things

[10:56] DrMcKay: btw, yesterday my client got to know I'm 17
[10:56] shanebo: I think the confusion with people (including myself when first learning node) is that required files happen before the server is started… Once you get your head around that, it doesn't feel dirty requiring everything up front...

[11:05] onethirtyfive: TheJH: My gut's telling me that the function returns and the response goes back out the middleware stack, which sets (maybe?) content-length headers or something. And then the callback goes off and... boom. It's modifying a 'sent' response.

[12:31] Tiller: Guys, a performance question : I'm making a "MMO"RPG using socket.io. What's the best : When a player moves or speak, or etc., I broadcast it to everyone on the map, or I cache it, and every x ms, for each player, I send new things that happent ?
[12:32] Tiller: I think that the cache is better for the server, but will add a tiny lag. But I think that the best.
[12:32] NeedHelp_: tiller i think if you're using socket.io and you try to broadcast every moving
[12:32] NeedHelp_: it wouldn't work
[12:32] NeedHelp_: because of performance
[12:32] adnam: Tiller: benchmark and optimize if it's a bottleneck
[12:32] NeedHelp_: if u use the mouse for playing the game
[12:32] Tiller: NeedHelp_: Yes, too much bandwidth used
[12:33] NeedHelp_: i would say
[12:33] NeedHelp_: you broadcast it to every nearby player
[12:33] NeedHelp_: not to all =)
[12:33] NeedHelp_: and every 33ms
[12:33] Tiller: yes yes, it was to players on the map :]
[12:33] Brandon_R: Hello guys i have a noob question
[12:33] NeedHelp_: hi Brandon_R
[12:34] Brandon_R: Can i use multicast to make a chat just for fun? 
[12:34] NeedHelp_: multicast?
[12:34] Brandon_R: multicast udp
[12:34] NeedHelp_: no idea ^^ ask somebody else :D
[12:35] TheJH: Brandon_R, as long as you're ok with corrupt packets just getting thrown away => dropped messages, I guess so
[12:35] Brandon_R: instead of iterating over all connected sockets, i just send one packet to the multicast ip and it gets delivered to all other clients
[12:35] TheJH: Brandon_R, should work
[12:35] Brandon_R: k
[12:35] TheJH: Brandon_R, but don't do it on a WLAN :D
[12:36] meandi2 has joined the channel
[12:36] Brandon_R: i won't lol why not though?
[12:36] TheJH: Brandon_R, because WLANs often drop packets (at least if your connection is bad)
[12:37] mehlah has joined the channel
[12:38] Brandon_R: oh
[12:38] Brandon_R: i don't really care about dropped packets etc i just want to do it for fun to see if i can be done

[12:40] NeedHelp_: a directory is also a path :(
[12:40] Brandon_R: so
[12:40] TomY has joined the channel
[12:40] NeedHelp_: and readFile crashes if its a dir
[12:40] Brandon_R: what tcp/udp projects you guys working on?
[12:41] tmedema: NeedHelp_: require('fs').stat(path, function(err, stats) { if (!err && stats.isFile()) { console.log('we have a file'); } else { console.log('we do not have a file'); });
[12:41] netlemur: TheJH: you can avoid that if you send the whole conversation once in a while. then the client can check if everything is fine. I think that's roughly how a lot of egoshooters deal with lags
[12:41] NeedHelp_: thanks =)
[12:43] Tobbe_: NeedHelp_: It's all in the docs. I've never worked with the filesystem using node, and I found what tmedema said in like 3 minutes ;)

[13:33] jorenl_: chintu: idk, I went to the dir with my .js in it
[13:33] jorenl_: chintu: that worked but you should probably be installing globally or something. anyone?
[13:33] chintu: so libraries have to be in same dir as .js file?
[13:34] NeedHelp_: chintu no
[13:35] chintu: hmm after doing that, now it seems to work
[13:35] NeedHelp_: i think if you use npm you only have to require("package");
[13:35] chintu: testing more
[13:35] jorenl_: chintu: http://howtonode.org/introduction-to-npm: "If you run npm install without any arguments, it tries to install the current folder"
[13:35] chintu: ah i see
[13:35] Brandon_R: hello guys, what is the best practice for install npm modules
[13:35] chintu: i thought it works like yum or php  pear :)
[13:35] Brandon_R: globally or make a package.json and file run npm install -d
[13:35] jorenl_: chintu: then do 'var mysql = require('mysql');'

[13:36] NeedHelp_: @Brandon_R

[13:36] jorenl_: then var db = mysql.createClient({ user: 'username',  password: 'password',});
[13:36] NeedHelp_: is mysql asynchron?
[13:36] Brandon_R: i like how nodejs is making the io name big
[13:36] jorenl_: and after that you can do db.query('stuff') :)
[13:36] Brandon_R: io domain tld
[13:37] chintu: cool i see the mysql records now :)

[13:56] davidbanham: How lazy is nowJS? If I have a bunch of objects defined in everyone.now do they all get synced to all clients all the time or do they only travel over the network when the client tries to access them?
[13:57] khmer: okay, dangit, i must be doing something stupid with no.de
[13:57] DrMcKay: TheJH: I mean, those algorithms node uses have been proven to be good, and since node uses OpenSSL, virtually no changes in implementation have been made

[13:57] khmer: all right, i have uploaded an ssh key and i have a new machine
[13:57] davidbanham: xerox: True, forgot about that.
[13:57] khmer: astropirate: ^

[13:58] khmer: osx
[13:58] khmer: r04r: i have done so
[13:58] khmer: astropirate: osx
[13:58] TheJH: davidbanham, I think nowJS syncs all the time, even if you don't access the stuff on the other side. but the in-browser stuff only syncs every second, it polls the object tree for changes
[13:58] TheJH: davidbanham, I think now.js is ugly
[13:58] khmer: one other thing: in the no.de config panel, the machines list shows my machine as 19 minutes old and "provisioning", but in the machine info screen itself, it says the machine is "RUNNING"
[13:58] astropirate: khmer, wiered.. it let me connect after adding the config to the config file
[13:58] khmer: is this normal?
[13:59] astropirate: yah
[13:59] khmer: if the machine is still provisioning, could that be the reason why

[14:01] khmer: astropirate: ssh <mydomain>.no.de
[14:01] NeedHelp_: why should there be an code limit?
[14:01] khmer: astropirate: ssh: connect to host <mydomain>.no.de port 36822: Connection refused
[14:01] NeedHelp_: it would be terrible^^
[14:02] Brandon_R: i think it's built into unix because nowjs only supports 10000 socket connections then you need multiply machines
[14:02] TheJH: xerox, because the in-browser thing polls an object tree every second and because there's (as far as I know) no way to know when data has been transferred successfully

[14:07] NeedHelp_: whith date().getMinutes(); i will get 7 for the actual time... but i want to get 07
[14:07] NeedHelp_: which function was it?
[14:07] NeedHelp_: i cant find it in selfhtml :(
[14:08] NeedHelp_: netlemur: if the session is destroyed i think you cant send a message ...
[14:08] TheJH: NeedHelp_, write a costum pad function: `function pad(str, n){while(str.length<n)str=" "+str;return str}`
[14:08] TheJH: v8: 1
[14:08] v8bot_: TheJH: 1
[14:08] netlemur: NeedHelp_: yep. but how can I create one without sending a new request?
[14:09] TheJH: v8: function pad(str, n){while(str.length<n)str=" "+str;return str}; pad("7", 2)
[14:09] v8bot_: TheJH: " 7"
[14:09] NeedHelp_: v8: test?
[14:09] v8bot_: NeedHelp_: SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input

[14:20] TheJH: NeedHelp_, you want pad(new Date().getHours()+"", 2)
[14:20] NeedHelp_: it ignores the whole function :/
[14:20] NeedHelp_: i'll try
[14:20] TheJH: v8: function pad(str){  while(str.length<2){   str = "0" + str;  }  return str; }; pad(new Date().getHours()+"", 2)
[14:20] v8bot_: TheJH: "07"
[14:20] _jhs has left the channel
[14:21] NeedHelp_: thanks it works
[14:21] NeedHelp_: can i hide the pad function for other js files?
[14:22] NeedHelp_: because i dont want to acces it from server.js but only from time.js file
[14:22] NeedHelp_: (i think like private function in java)
[14:22] DrMcKay: NeedHelp_: it's hidden until you export it
[14:22] slicky: if you write it in the time.js file and don't export it, it'll be "private"
[14:23] NeedHelp_: ahahh ok

[14:32] DrMcKay: yeah, he said something along this lines
[14:33] NeedHelp_: how can i give node.js the permission to host an :80 http server?
[14:33] DrMcKay: NeedHelp_: sudo node app.js
[14:33] NeedHelp_: ahh
[14:33] NeedHelp_: ty =)
[14:33] xerox: : /
[14:33] freewil: NeedHelp_, be careful with that one, your app will have unlimited access to your system
[14:33] TheJH: NeedHelp_, alternatively, redirect stuff with iptables - running stuff as root might be dangerous
[14:33] DrMcKay: NeedHelp_: but don't do it in production
[14:33] freewil: probably dont want to do that
[14:34] TheJH: :D
[14:34] xerox: TheJH's solution is the best
[14:34] DrMcKay: yes, what TheJH said
[14:34] TheJH: warning storm :D
[14:34] NeedHelp_: iptables?
[14:34] DrMcKay: (or use node-http-proxy)
[14:34] TheJH: NeedHelp_, are you using linux or mac or so?
[14:34] NeedHelp_: ubuntu
[14:34] NeedHelp_: but i use it since 3 days
[14:35] NeedHelp_: because i started node.js dev =)
[14:35] TheJH: NeedHelp_, there's a system component called "iptables", you can use it to redirect incoming stuff that goes to port 80 to port 8080 or so
[14:35] NeedHelp_: and it works with localhost?
[14:35] NeedHelp_: if i go to http://localhost/  i want to get my page
[14:35] NeedHelp_: not localhost:8080 or other ports
[14:36] TheJH: NeedHelp_, yes, should work
[14:36] NeedHelp_: how can iacces iptables?
[14:36] NeedHelp_: * I access
[14:36] TheJH: NeedHelp_, run this as root: `iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080` (but note that this will be reverted on the next reboot)
[14:36] NeedHelp_: wtf dude :D

[14:38] yorick: *or* you could just run nginx or some other reverse proxy on port 80
[14:38] NeedHelp_: bye
[14:38] TheJH: huh?
[14:38] DrMcKay: yeah, well...
[14:38] yorick: and then make node listen on that
[14:38] TheJH: I guess I wasn't clear enough...

[14:43] TheJH: NeedHelp_, "will be reverted on the next reboot"
[14:43] NeedHelp_: this means i dont have to reboot?
[14:44] TheJH: NeedHelp_, the command will have effect immediately, but when you reboot, the effect is gone
[14:44] NeedHelp_: ...
[14:44] NeedHelp_: iFail 4.3 :>
[14:44] yorick: it means you should not reboot if you want it to work
[14:44] yorick: but also, that iptables solution is a bad solution :P
[14:44] TheJH: NeedHelp_, unless you put that command in a file where it gets executed at boot time
[14:44] NeedHelp_: why?
[14:44] navaru has joined the channel
[14:44] NeedHelp_: TheJH idk how to do this :>
[14:45] NeedHelp_: <-- linux user since 3 days
[14:45] yorick: it's probably better to run nginx on port 80 (or some other reverse proxy), or some scgi capable server, and then connect it to node
[14:45] TheJH: NeedHelp_, ask in #ubuntu or so
[14:45] DrMcKay: yorick: node-http-proxy ftw
[14:45] TheJH: yorick, why? only extra overhead+bigger attack surface
[14:45] yorick: TheJH: nginx doesn't have attack surface :P
[14:45] yorick: DrMcKay: except for you're still sudoing node to run on port 80 then
[14:46] dnjaramba_ has joined the channel

[14:47] TheJH: yorick, I read "attack surface" as "when there's a hole in it, it's bad"

[15:28] der|: I'm trying to handle POST data, and it seems a session cookie somehow is not allowing the http.ServerRequest 'data' and 'end' events to fire. This results on not being able to parse the form data... If I delete the cookie it works. Any ideas on why this could happen ?
[15:28] NeedHelp__: somebody want to acces the ../../../../etc/shadow dir
[15:28] NeedHelp__: lol server crashed because of this^
[15:28] TheJH: NeedHelp__, sorry for that :D
[15:28] DrMcKay: lol
[15:28] jamesw: Something I just realized....the Blob object that is defined in the HTML5 spec....does Node even have a clue what this is and is it even possible to turn that into a file in Node?
[15:28] Brandon_R: lol does the etc/passwd show the password in plaintext?
[15:28] TheJH: Brandon_R, no
[15:28] Brandon_R: what does it show it as?
[15:29] der|: heh, a * ?
[15:29] NeedHelp__: how can i search for a string?

[15:30] TheJH: NeedHelp__, read https://github.com/thejh/docs/blob/fs-security/articles/file-system/security/article.md
[15:30] NeedHelp__: my password dont contain an x=)
[15:31] jamesw: User1 picks a file locally, they set it as "ready".  User2 connects to server and requests File.  User1's machine splits it into Blobs and sends them via Socket.IO.  User2 should get them as a stream to their browser (i.e. directly download the file)
[15:31] TheJH: NeedHelp__, yes, it's a placeholder
[15:31] jamesw: that is the intention at least
[15:31] jamesw: yes trying to upload it
[15:31] jamesw: but in pieces
[15:31] TheJH: well, I'm away now
[15:31] DrMcKay: jamesw: sneaky... but why in pieces?
[15:31] NeedHelp__: if (filename.indexOf('\0') !== -1) {   return respond('That was evil.'); }
[15:31] DrMcKay: jamesw: you could make it a simple file upload form
[15:31] jamesw: .........................I had a reason........but that was 3 days ago at 4 am.
[15:31] NeedHelp__: i dont understand this example code :(
[15:32] jamesw: well for one thing I don't want the file saved on the server ever
[15:32] jamesw: so the file isn't uploaded until User2 requests it
[15:32] DrMcKay: jamesw: not a problem, node doesn't automatically save uploaded files
[15:32] TheJH: NeedHelp__, nullbytes can be used for some evil things when dealing with ffilesystem stuff
[15:32] DrMcKay: jamesw: you can send them to some blobstore like gridfs or whatever
[15:32] TheJH: now I'm really away
[15:33] jamesw: you lost me at blobstore and gridfs.  Time to google.
[15:33] DrMcKay: oh, also, I'm writing a libuv-based HTTP server for gridfs

[15:55] khmer: i'm just gonna keep pestering...has anyone used node_redis?
[15:56] jorenl_: DrMcKay, khmer: yes but in this case it's important that the server stores it and not the client :)

[15:59] BigWookie: :) hi
[16:00] jorenl_: khmer: ?
[16:00] khmer: jorenl_: a session is a document--rarely does it need to be related to other sessions. so it's perfect for document-storage, like mongodb or redis
[16:00] khmer: jorenl_: i suggest redis, which as i've just learned lives in memory as much as it can, and so would be perfect for sessions

[16:36] sdwrage: ah… 
[16:36] sdwrage: TheJH:  how do I obtain stable version of npm
[16:37] TheJH: sdwrage, I was talking about node versions
[16:37] TheJH: !@sdwrage mem npm-install
[16:37] jhbot: sdwrage, you can install npm by doing "curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh". If you don't feel comfortable piping data from http in a sudo'ed shell (which really isn't a good idea), you can also download it, look at it and then pipe it in the shell.
[16:38] BigWookie: can i configure it for generic?
[16:38] sdwrage: so you can't just call sh?
[16:38] sdwrage: you must use sudo if calling curl as well?
[16:39] TheJH: sdwrage, the curl doesn't need to be sudoed. the sh does (unless you want to install npm local to your user somehow)

[16:53] cmc: I'm creating a connection with net.createConnection, but after about 10 seconds or so, it closes.  I added listeners to check why, and it seems the "end" event is invoked, but the server isn't closing the socket on its end.
[16:53] cmc: Plus, the "close" event isn't always invoked.
[16:53] TheJH: sdwrage, weird, it should work... what does "echo $PATH" say?

[16:56] TheJH: cmc, filter for `tcp.flags.fin == 1`, I think

[17:09] cmc: sdwrage I really don't like the interface, though...it feels too fake.  And the mice really annoy me.  Actually, everything about them annoys me.  No shortcut keys.
[17:09] sdwrage: fake?
[17:09] eldios has joined the channel
[17:09] sdwrage: cmc, I use the touchpad
[17:10] sdwrage: you can always get a normal mouse
[17:10] sdwrage: cmc, no shortcut keys? what?
[17:10] cmc: sdwrage I mean how the mouse moves in general.  The touchpad just makes it worse.
[17:10] joshthecoder has joined the channel
[17:10] qbert65536: cmc, totally
[17:10] sdwrage: cmc, the touchpad gestures are awesome
[17:10] cmc: sdwrage in windows or linux you can use Alt+key
[17:10] qbert65536: lame, I use the mouse as  little as possible
[17:10] cmc: sdwrage and access all of the menus.
[17:10] cmc: qbert65536 exactly.
[17:11] sdwrage: you can map shortcuts 0_o
[17:11] cmc: sdwrage and that takes time.  and there are only so many keys.
[17:11] sdwrage: TheJH: that was the only folder
[17:11] marcello3d: are there any good node middlewares for getting stats/performance metrics on your page serving?
[17:11] adambeynon has joined the channel

[17:11] sdwrage: yeah
[17:11] sdwrage: should I install from macports?
[17:11] qbert65536: marcello3d, I use google analytics - don't know of anything server side
[17:12] cmc: sdwrage that touchpad gestures make me mad.  they tend to not work when i want them to and work when i don't want them to.
[17:12] sdwrage: cmc, always work for me :P
[17:12] marcello3d: qbert65536: I'm thinking like measuring the time it took to serve the request and simple page stats

[17:12] marcello3d: I did not! *checks it out*
[17:13] marcello3d: nice :)
[17:13] sdwrage: id never run a server on windows or osx, id never make a mac or linux my pure gaming machine, id never do design work in linux and would never do programming in windows
[17:13] cmc: TheJH if node is killing the connection, do you have any idea how to prevent it from doing so?
[17:13] TheJH: cmc, it shouldn't happen at all, it's weird
[17:13] cmc: sdwrage I agree with you up to the last part--windows is sometimes a must for clients.
[17:14] sdwrage: cmc, what do you mean?
[17:14] TheJH: cmc, ae you sure you're not doing any weird stuff with the socket, just writing to it?
[17:14] isaacs has joined the channel
[17:14] sdwrage: TheJH: I am just installing from macports
[17:14] sdwrage: seeing if that helps
[17:14] TheJH: isaacs, sdwrage has problems with installing npm on a mac
[17:15] TheJH: sdwrage, isaacs is npms author
[17:15] sdwrage: gotcha
[17:15] cmc: TheJH searched for socket in the file.  the only places I use it are for creating, writing, and adding listeners.  and using the setKeepAlive.
[17:15] cmc: TheJH I'll try removing the setKeepAlive--maybe it's causing the problem in a different way?
[17:15] TheJH: cmc, hmm, weird - what node version are you using?
[17:15] marcello3d: qbert65536: project sounds cool! is it something you'd run locally or is there a central server?
[17:15] BigWookie: ;_; I just can't find it, how does configure determine the -march flag ( and sets it to atom ) ( 5.7 )
[17:15] cmc: TheJH v0.5.6-pre
[17:16] jmoyers has joined the channel
[17:16] TheJH: cmc, I'd try 0.5.x (but not -pre) for unstable or 0.4.x for stable
[17:16] TheJH: cmc, don't use the git master unless you want stuff to break
[17:16] isaacs: sdwrage: can you gist the output, please?
[17:16] cmc: TheJH I wasn't the one who installed it, so I'll have to contact my sysadmin.  :(
[17:17] TheJH: isaacs, he says that curl|sudo sh worked, but nothing named "npm" was in the file system afterwards
[17:17] cmc: TheJH I retried the code without setKeepAlive.  Exact same results.
[17:17] robotmay has joined the channel
[17:17] isaacs: TheJH: the output will tell you where it was installed
[17:17] sdwrage: isaacs: if I was able to...
[17:18] sdwrage: the curl call doesn't output
[17:18] sdwrage: it runs the download, shows 100%, and hangs for a while.
[17:18] isaacs: sdwrage: why aren't you able to copy and paste the output?  the curl | sh would definitely print *something* to the screen
[17:18] isaacs: i need that something
[17:18] sdwrage: then returns to console
[17:18] TheJH: cmc, then tell your admin that you want a more stable version, either 0.5.7 or 0.4.12
[17:18] isaacs: sdwrage: yeah, that's not working, then
[17:18] sdwrage: hrm
[17:18] isaacs: sdwrage: what's `node -v`?
[17:18] sdwrage: lemme look
[17:18] isaacs: sdwrage: or try:  curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | npm_debug=1 sh
[17:18] sdwrage: 4.11
[17:19] isaacs: ?
[17:19] isaacs: 0.4.11, you mean?
[17:19] sdwrage: yeah

[17:44] jorenl_: Brandon_R: cool projects? Well, not with socket.io kicking users from my app every 30 mins :p that aint cool
[17:44] cmc: deadman87 TheJH suggested I check for FIN packets with wireshark, and it appears node is terminating the connection

[17:55] codely: isaacs: no no i meant someone wrote a module for your, yes your :P npm system.
[17:56] deadman87: definitely.. 0.4.x branch is stable so that should work. Else github needs one more issue :P

[18:08] codely: really?
[18:08] codely: registry site? didn't see it on the nodejs list ..?
[18:08] isaacs: codely: i'd really like to make it super-trivial to run a local registry that does filtered replication from the main one, so all your npm actions are local, and it just hits the public repo only when it needs to, or to replicate

[18:10] codely: nice

[18:20] cmc: deadman87 it's possible.  The server, after the handshake, sends tons of data...
[18:21] deadman87: and is ther any handlers for that data in node?
[18:21] deadman87: there*

[18:22] cmc: deadman87 ok
[18:22] deadman87: and see if the connection still closes
[18:23] deadman87: also, since its a load of data, check your ram/cpu usage
[18:23] `3rdEden: jorenl_ it should just work around the clock, could you report it in https://github.com/learnboost/socket.io?
[18:23] deadman87: if you're running low on ram, that could cause the problem cmc 
[18:24] jorenl_: `3rdEden: ok. But I want to investigate my client a bit more first. Maybe the disconnect is caused by an error in the client? Is that even possible?
[18:25] `3rdEden: jorenl_  socket.io has build in reconnects, so it should not disconnect at all. Maybe for a small period due to fucked up network, but it should always reconnect again
[18:25] liveink has joined the channel
[18:26] jorenl_: `3rdEden: it does reconnect.
[18:26] `3rdEden: oh.
[18:27] jorenl_: instantly. See, it *is* intended behavior. The problem is I'm losing data stored as local variables in the on('connection'...) anonymous function
[18:27] jetienne has joined the channel
[18:27] `3rdEden: yess that is less then ideal.
[18:28] jorenl_: `3rdEden: storing data that way, or the behavior? I asked if data stored with socket.set('value',...) is kept even with those reconnects, but noone replied

[18:30] PuffTheMagic: i didnt see that on the docs which is why i asked
[18:31] jorenl_: `3rdEden: Thanks. So there is no way to store data associated to a client without it disappearing on automatic reconnect?
[18:31] `3rdEden:  it's not something socket.io does for you at this point
[18:31] marcello3d: jorenl_: generate a unique id for the client and have that sent up to ID the connection
[18:31] deadman87: PuffTheMagic, my bad. Assumed .close() would be there.
[18:31] `3rdEden: what marcello3d said,
[18:32] deadman87: could be undocumented.. You can always try it
[18:32] marcello3d: depending on the kind of security you need you can generate that id client-side on page load
[18:32] `3rdEden: And I don't really think it's something that socket.io should do
[18:32] knifed has joined the channel
[18:32] jorenl_: `3rdEden: You're the dev :P But it seems a useful feature to store data associated to a client.
[18:32] marcello3d: `3rdEden: do you work on it?
[18:32] schwab has joined the channel
[18:33] `3rdEden: marcello3d yes I'm one of the socket.io core devs

[18:34] bwinton has joined the channel
[18:34] `3rdEden: jorenl_ socket.set/get is currently designed to make it easier to scale across multiple processes
[18:34] `3rdEden: so you don't save your state in one process
[18:34] `3rdEden: marcello3d secure in what way/
[18:34] marcello3d: 3rd: is it generated by the server, client? does the client ever send it to the server as an identifier, or is it all server-side?

[18:35] anveo has joined the channel
[18:35] r04r: Huh. I think I tried that, too, but hold on. Going to see if it still does that.
[18:36] jorenl_: `3rdEden: Ok, I'm not using .get anyways. Storing local vars to the anonymous on connection function seemed nice. It's sad it wipes after a while.
[18:36] pizthewiz has joined the channel
[18:37] `3rdEden: marcello3d when you connect to socket.io, you start with a handshake. During this handshake you as developer can accept or decline the connection, when it's accepted we generate a sessionid for your, and place it on the server and send it back to the client. The client then uses that session id to establish the realtime connection. The sessionid expires withing 60 seconds (or less).
[18:38] MrTopf has joined the channel
[18:38] jorenl_: `3rdEden: I thought socket.io tried to hide all protocol/technical connection trouble from the programmer, and I think a 'session' is a more useful concept then a 'connection' that resets after a while. That's just me though.
[18:38] `3rdEden: jorenl_ yup, but anon functions are a pain to debug anyways ;o
[18:38] robi42 has joined the channel
[18:38] `3rdEden: jorenl_ we probably shouldn't have named it a `session id` if it was named connection id it would have caused a lot less confusion

[18:39] `3rdEden: r04r yw :)
[18:39] marcello3d: `3rdEden: in the case of jsonp or long polling, is the id used to identify subsequent http requests as part of the same socket io connection? what happens after 60 seconds?
[18:39] `3rdEden: btw we also have a #socket.io channel on freenode
[18:39] mikeal has joined the channel
[18:39] codely: heh, anyone, on enumerating over a functions contents?

[18:40] cmc: deadman87 I'm handling most of the data, but it still dies.
[18:41] `3rdEden: marcello3d yes it's to identify the subsequent requests. And the 60 seconds is not applied for the subsequent requests
[18:41] `3rdEden: it's more that the session id needs to be used to establish a connection on the serverside so we know that the session id is still valid and up to date.
[18:41] ajpiano has joined the channel
[18:41] deadman87: does node throw any errors when it dies?
[18:41] cmc: no, it does not.

[18:49] jeffContext has joined the channel
[18:49] deadman87: cmc.. Here's an idea. Why don't you run an example server/client with net and see if the connection closes.. Just to be sure the problem isn't with node itself or the environment of ur local machine
[18:50] cmc: deadman87 just one connection.
[18:50] cmc: deadman87 i'll try that.

[18:58] deadman87: ^^ +1
[18:58] jeffContext: codely: it seems connect & express are leaders.   It's nice to see that emerge

[19:29] uptownben: I wanted to try to understand something about node, just to clear things up in my head..  if I am build an app that will have a large amount of users, is the "best practice" to have a box running multiple "instances" of my app.js , eachon a different port, and have a node "router" script running on a known port (3000?) that routes requests to on of the other "instances"? is that about right?
[19:29] uptownben: *building
[19:30] tmzt: and something like redis or mongo in cluster acting as a database for sessions and message queue
[19:30] uptownben: yeah, I'm running mongo
[19:31] codely: jeffContext: http://pastebin.com/iXcVh75p
[19:31] uptownben: message queueing would depend on my app, correct?
[19:31] cmc: uptownben to the best of my knowledge, no.  node is event-driven, so it would be more efficient to just use the server as its supposed to be used.
[19:31] tmzt: if I understand it, it only makes sense to have as many instances as cpus or double that

[19:32] uptownben: sounded the oppostie
[19:32] uptownben: *opposite

[19:32] cmc: uptownben hmmm...that was poorly phrased.
[19:32] parshap has joined the channel
[19:32] cmc: uptownben if you're using http, just used http.createServer.  it'll handle all requests just fine.
[19:32] uptownben: http server serving json only
[19:33] markwubben has joined the channel
[19:33] cmc: uptownben even better.  it would be less efficient to have multiple instances of node running
[19:33] uptownben: OK, what about scaling?
[19:33] uptownben: would I just add a new box when I start to see performance issues?
[19:33] uptownben: I would need a router/load balancer then
[19:33] cmc: uptownben if you have a large number of servers/cores, it might be more efficient to have a router, but for server json data, it should be just fine
[19:34] cmc: uptownben you'd need a lot of users before it makes an impact
[19:34] cmc: uptownben what's the ballpark?
[19:34] uptownben: I should hope to have that problem, but I need to know how to prepare for it
[19:34] deadman87: uptownben, you could use node-http-proxy and setup a load-balancing process exposed to the world
[19:35] cmc: uptownben deadman87 that would probably be best.

[20:38] Brandon_R: "binary": This is the "binary string" format mentioned earlier, and is in the process of being deprecated. Avoid its use. 
[20:38] AvianFlu: Brandon_R, probably hex
[20:39] AvianFlu: you can represent base 2 in base 16 with 1/4 the letters on the screen, so to speak, so it often is used in place of binary
[20:39] Brandon_R: yeah hex is my end result

[23:41] thinkjson: sweet. thanks!
[23:41] thinkjson: and I can probably get away with static serve for the read
[23:42] dominictarr: yeah, static uses streams internally I think
[23:42] Brandon_R: what is that next() function in connect about?
[23:42] thinkjson: can I parameterize the route?

[23:48] thinkjson: for sure
[23:49] dominictarr: just do what i showed you before, but pipe the file to the response
