[01:06] aeo: Do you think that could be a memory leak?
[01:06] tuhoojabotti: It's awesome
[01:06] tuhoojabotti: No?
[01:06] aeo: (My app is getting memory errors)
[01:06] tuhoojabotti: GC should handle that.
[01:06] aeo: Yeah, that's what I thought
[01:07] aeo: Although I'm disturbed we need a garbage collector just to get a time.
[01:07] tuhoojabotti: I haven't got any problems with memory, though I do use that.
[01:07] AAA_awright: jaekwon: The documentation specifies how it searches for files to load, if you specify a directory, it'll look for an index.js file to load, which itself could be a symlink to another file
[01:08] AAA_awright: Because generally you want to name your files as your module name, lib/myapp.js, lib/index.js -> myapp.js
[01:09] jaekwon: yay

[03:10] AAA_awright: Especially when we can get rid of the central repository
[03:11] a_meteorite: AAA_awright: npm can clone repos
[03:11] AAA_awright: hi a_meteorite
[03:11] AAA_awright: What's the point of npm duplicating git then?
[03:12] a_meteorite: it's providing dependency tracking for free
[03:12] a_meteorite: and version management
[03:12] aaronblohowiak: AAA_awright: have you used a lot of git submodules?
[03:12] a_meteorite: at least I'm 99% sure you can have it clone from a repo
[03:12] AAA_awright: I swear one day I'm gonna write a better build system and it's going to profile build times and report percentages complete
[03:12] a_meteorite: I can't find out how..

[03:31] Aria: And most people use npm with node. Or a great deal.

[03:35] Emmanuel` has joined the channel
[03:35] AAA_awright: Ruby gems are stupid too, though mostly for the awful name
[03:36] SUBSTACK: that hardly factors into it
[03:36] Aria: Rubygems are also horrible because they have runtime dependencies.
[03:36] AAA_awright: My wrath isn't for npm specifically but is a loathing for package managers and build systems in general
[03:36] SUBSTACK: ruby gems are bad because everything is global and modifies the loading system
[03:36] Aria: npm is the first one I've not had piss me off.
[03:37] SUBSTACK: AAA_awright: you lose a lot of time managing dependencies that the package manager can handle for you
[03:37] deedubs: AAA_awright: doesn't have a problem with a package manager usinf rm -fR /usr to uninstall packages.  It's the idea of the package manager itself
[03:37] WarheadsSE: never had serious problems with CPAN
[03:37] AAA_awright: Actually there is one package manager I like, Portage
[03:38] SUBSTACK: portage is the naturalistic fallacy of package managers

[03:39] AAA_awright: Aria: Really? npm did nothing but cause problems for me... This was back when it installed everything globally, modified require.paths, and so on
[03:39] AAA_awright: What bugged me was the coding
[03:39] AAA_awright: I tried to hook into the API
[03:39] AAA_awright: ... There is no API
[03:39] AAA_awright: It's all runtime code
[03:39] Emmanuel` has joined the channel
[03:39] SUBSTACK: there is an api
[03:40] Aria: Oh, well, yeh. That was the first draft.
[03:40] Aria: npm now that it's all-local is an entirely different beast.

[03:40] SUBSTACK: I can't really take your criticisms seriously since you're complaining about issues that were solved a long time ago.
[03:40] Aria: It's far less clever.
[03:40] AAA_awright: Well there is an API, that's *running the command and providing command line argumetns to it, and parsing the text output*
[03:40] SUBSTACK: AAA_awright: I've written 2 modules that use the npm api

[03:48] deedubs: Did you deploy node.js apps while working in those languages? :)
[03:48] zkirill: deedubs: nope
[03:49] deedubs: there is rumor that node.js isn't very good at working with large data
[03:49] AAA_awright: SUBSTACK: I should be able to run require('npm') anymore without having to set enviornment variables, create config files, or having any text output for any reason, or at the very least not before I call a method
[03:50] deedubs: There aren't that many people that have lots of experience in it. So supplementing your team can be hard/costly
[03:50] AAA_awright: (and if the config file doesn't exist it exit()s on you)
[03:50] Aria: deedubs: V8 has a 1GB heap size limit in older versions. The newest (unstable) node uses the new version.
[03:50] Aria: deedubs: But you need to parallelize anyway ;-)
[03:50] deedubs: Aria: I know
[03:51] AAA_awright: Aria: It's the subtle and undefined different ways that packages compile which is exactly why you compile them
[03:51] AAA_awright: Which in any event there's things like ccache and distcc to handle the fact they're mostly similar
[03:51] Aria: Heh. Repeatability is the essence of build and release management. I'm so not into subtle and undefined difference.
[03:52] zkirill: deedubs: can we just call a C++ program if that becomes a problem?
[03:52] zkirill: how easy is that to do
[03:52] deedubs: zkirill: Those things being said node.js is awesome and I highly recommend at the very least experimenting with it in your stack

[04:42] Tobsn: anyone an idea which API (data) is better - 4sq or yelp?
[04:42] russfrank: Tobsn: they provide different data?
[04:42] Tobsn: yeah of course
[04:43] russfrank: no i mean
[04:43] russfrank: how is one supposed to compare them

[04:43] Tobsn: which system holds in general MORE data is one and then as well which API gives you more data

[04:48] Tobsn: oh
[04:48] Tobsn: nah its just more of a broad question, im trying to offer geo location data to users

[04:48] dmitrig01 has joined the channel
[04:49] ryanfitz has joined the channel

[09:31] dgathright has joined the channel

[09:33] herbySk has joined the channel
[09:33] lyte: I think there's some funk you can pull with asking require to tell what and where it's pulling in, you could also just try requiring mongoose from an interactive node prompt

[09:42] garrensmith has joined the channel
[09:43] ZedPepsi: Hi guys! I am using node.js to run a large script and I have a special scripty requirement. This is not an interactive app. I need to block until an event has actually occurred. Is there a way to do this?
[09:44] garrensm_ has joined the channel
[09:44] lyte: Why can't it just be a callback ?
[09:44] ZedPepsi: it's a requirement of the infrastructure that I'm in
[09:44] lyte: Lies :)
[09:45] ZedPepsi: briefly, I have a large library for web apps that uses certain APIs that are for the web and I am testing it in nodejs
[09:45] lyte: There are many sync calls you can use, but it seems odd to design an app to use them when anything can be done as a callback...
[09:45] ZedPepsi: therefore I need to mock up XMLHttpRequest
[09:45] ZedPepsi: which is synchronous
[09:45] mmalecki: uhm, XMLHttpRequest shouldn't be synchronous
[09:46] lyte: yeh...
[09:46] ZedPepsi: in this case it is
[09:46] ZedPepsi: if you pass the synchronous flag
[09:46] lyte: a) you have to *tell* it to be synchronous with a flag
[09:46] lyte: that ^
[09:46] ZedPepsi: right
[09:46] lyte: b) some browsers ignore the flag
[09:46] lyte: learn to async.
[09:46] mmalecki: you shouldn't do it anyway
[09:46] ZedPepsi: All right guys, I have a simple question: is it possible to wait for an event to complete in nodejs
[09:47] Emmanuel` has joined the channel
[09:47] lyte: c) other's have already probably written XHR mocks
[09:47] lyte: d) just use a callback...
[09:47] ZedPepsi: the ones i tried to do not work
[09:47] lyte: what's wrong with waiting for the data to pass back and firing the event ?
[09:47] ZedPepsi: i don't understand that last sentence
[09:48] ZedPepsi: all right one last try: is it possible to wait until an event has fired?
[09:49] ZedPepsi: "no" is a fine answer

[12:30] blup has joined the channel
[12:31] pele04: Suggestions so far: install Node on Linux in a VM instead, or reinstall openssl. The former is a huge hassle, the latter is very dangerous on OS X

[12:35] dubenstein has joined the channel
[12:36] telemachus: pele04: What about installing a newer version of openssl, but _not_ overwriting osx's built-in one? Use MacPorts or Homebrew and you can put it somewhere else in your PATH

[12:45] Illusioneer has left the channel
[12:45] telemachus: pele04: I'm not sure what you mean? As far as I recall, _some_ versions of openssl on osx caused problems for lots of things - certainly both node and ruby, in my experience.
[12:46] martinciu has joined the channel
[12:46] telemachus: Why would a version >= 1 solve that?
[12:46] pele04: telemachus: good point. I guess I'm just thinking that if a very common openssl version on OS X caused problems, this should be documented all over the place, and this error should have appeared for thousands of people. That doesn't seem to be the case when I google it
[12:47] AAA_awright: Does mscdex hang out here?

[13:09] telemachus: and if you have limited needs, it should work I believe
[13:09] telemachus: but more complex builds fail on it sometimes
[13:09] telemachus: the 4gb is for Apple's idiotic sdk and ide and general crap
[13:10] telemachus: but they don't distribute gcc + the tool chain separately

[13:13] Tobsn: all together its more like 9gb
[13:14] Tobsn: kalisjoshua, just recompile
[13:16] kalisjoshua: well then I guess I should ask what is the current version of node? when I run 'node -v' I am getting 'v0.5.6-pre' is that what it should be?
[13:16] telemachus: Tobsn: ugh - 9GB? I get 6.3. God, what a waste.
[13:17] telemachus: I know disk space is cheap, but still.
[13:17] Tobsn: actualyl youre right
[13:17] Tobsn: 6.3 here
[13:17] Tobsn: maybe they changed something
[13:17] telemachus: kalisjoshua: There is a stable and an unstable branch
[13:17] pele04: AAA_awright: I was indeed joking. Btw, I was looking for you. The reason was that I found an irc log online where you had earlier discussed the exact problem I'm having
[13:17] Tobsn: before i had lion and xcode 4.2 it was 9.6 or something
[13:17] telemachus: 0.4.x is stable, 0.5.x is unstable
[13:18] telemachus: 0.4.12 and 0.5.10, currently
[13:18] kalisjoshua: <telemachus> do I just need to checkout a tag and compile that?
[13:18] telemachus: I think the 0.6 merge is soon-ish though? Not sure about that

[14:21] telemachus: Which is one reason it might be easier to just download the tarball

[14:29] kalisjoshua: true
[14:29] kalisjoshua: that I understand
[14:29] kalisjoshua: and agree with

[22:37] AAA_awright: Does mscdex hang out here?
[22:37] xerox: could Python 3.2.2 be the problem?
[22:38] xerox: seem much newer than "version 2.6 or higher" recommended in Installation
[22:42] paul_k has joined the channel
[22:43] AAA_awright: xerox: Yeah you want 2.7
[22:44] AAA_awright: xerox: I forgot I've had that exact error because Gentoo symlinked python to python-3 and not python-2
[22:44] xerox: urgh
[22:44] AAA_awright: (that was an easy fix, eselect python ...)
[22:44] xerox: is there a way around that? I am not sure I want to ask my sysadmin to install another version of python alongside
[22:45] AAA_awright: xerox: Isn't there also smake or somethinc?
[22:45] AAA_awright: No, cmake
[22:45] xerox: hmm what do you mean?
[22:45] AAA_awright: xerox: But yes, python should die off the face of the earth already

[22:46] AvianFlu: don't know the why of it
[22:46] xerox: can I use --prefix=$HOME/node with cmake? I have no idea how to use cmake.
[22:46] jesusabdullah: maybe?
[22:46] jesusabdullah: I can tell you that cmake sucks
[22:46] jesusabdullah: isn't that right SubStack ?
[22:47] AAA_awright: Not as bad as python
[22:47] jesusabdullah: oh, nononono
[22:47] jesusabdullah: way worse than python
[22:47] AAA_awright: I'll take cmake over your crappy python build system
[22:47] jesusabdullah: oh, a BUILD system?
[22:47] SubStack: it's true
[22:47] AAA_awright: I'll gladly use autotools over python
[22:47] SubStack: all build systems are terrible, but especially cmake
[22:47] jesusabdullah: waf probably sucks
[22:47] jesusabdullah: and gyp as well
[22:47] SubStack: waf is pretty shit but it's not as bad as cmake
[22:47] AAA_awright: Just on principle we shouldn't be using waf anyways
[22:47] jesusabdullah: but python itself, despite its flaws, is still useful. I think it's going to be "the next java" but, y'know
[22:48] jesusabdullah: Obviously we need a javascript-based build system
[22:48] jesusabdullah: except it would probably suck too
[22:48] SubStack: waf doesn't infuriate me by doing everything entirely different and throwing an ncurses interface in my face that I can't easily kill
[22:48] SubStack: fuck everything about cmake
[22:48] AAA_awright: I've never used cmake's ncurses interface, or an GUI
[22:48] jesusabdullah: cmake from a user standpoint is really annoying from what I remember
[22:49] AAA_awright: http://bzfx.net/guru/ <-- Who wants to help me code this?
[22:49] SubStack: xerox: to do prefix it's some bullshit with cmake -D CMAKE_PREFIX=blah .
[22:49] jesusabdullah: I guess it's "more cross platform?" but aside from that...geez
[22:49] SubStack: or something like that
[22:49] SubStack: seriously
[22:49] SubStack: fuck that noise
[22:49] jesusabdullah: I don't understand guru's goals well enough to be useful for that project
[22:49] xerox: SubStack: uhm ok
[22:49] AAA_awright: They're all listed there
[22:49] xerox: I need the admin to install cmake.
[22:49] AAA_awright: kinda
[22:49] AAA_awright: xerox: Even that might not be available...
[22:50] jesusabdullah: build systems from a developer side of things confuse me

[22:50] jesusabdullah: I don't have nearly enough experience working with compiled projects
[22:50] AAA_awright: xerox: python-<tab><tab> doesn't list 2.7?

[23:22] AAA_awright: so 'nice' only begins to start to describe it, I think :)
[23:22] mmalecki: yeah, well, systems we have are all shit
[23:23] mmalecki: I used to like Jam, but lack of documentation killed it
[23:24] mmalecki: AAA_awright: what are you planning to write this in?
[23:24] AAA_awright: Maybe C++, maybe Node.js
[23:24] AAA_awright: It's very similar to my other project in terms of capability: http://magnode.org/
[23:24] mmalecki: I would go for node.js
[23:24] mmalecki: it's one of the projects where you will apprieciate duck-typing
[23:25] AAA_awright: Which is in active development, despite being a CMS it has the same core functionality: It transforms stuff of one arbritary type into stuff of another type that you ask for
[23:25] mmalecki: AAA_awright: bad gateway
[23:25] AAA_awright: Argh
[23:25] AAA_awright: mmalecki: try again... But the better documentation is at http://magnode.org/doc/en/ anyways
[23:25] AAA_awright: for now
[23:26] mmalecki: AAA_awright: works
[23:26] mmalecki: AAA_awright: meh, node.js cms, I don't like them
[23:27] AAA_awright: This is different, really
[23:27] AAA_awright: TRUST MEEEEEEE
[23:27] AAA_awright: Erm. Yeah, it's really designed around the strengths of Node.js, I think
[23:27] AAA_awright: and Javascript
[23:27] AAA_awright: I've had this idea to use Javascript for this even before Node.js so it's not just "Hey we should have a Node.js CMS"
[23:28] AAA_awright: The Node.js came to the CMS, and not the other way around, here
[23:28] AAA_awright: er
[23:28] AAA_awright: I guess yeah

[23:30] jesusabdullah: For some reason, rdf offends my sense of aesthetics
[23:30] jesusabdullah: I'm not sure why
[23:32] AAA_awright: jesusabdullah: What about it? It's just a data model, like the DOM is a data model
[23:33] AAA_awright: Reload the page, I merged "about" and "design" into a single section
[23:34] mikeal has joined the channel
[23:39] jesusabdullah: AAA_awright: I don't know! Maybe I just don't like xml
[23:39] AAA_awright: jesusabdullah: XML uses DOM, RDF is something entirely different
[23:39] jesusabdullah: like, maybe angle-brackets are inherently displeasing
[23:39] AAA_awright: You're complaining about a syntax, and not even one that RDF uses
[23:39] jesusabdullah: idk man it sure LOOKS like xml to me
[23:40] AAA_awright: Where do you see XML?
[23:40] jesusabdullah: project.doap.rdf
[23:40] AAA_awright: force-reload the page
[23:40] svnlto has joined the channel
[23:41] jesusabdullah: ...I'm not sure that's better.
[23:41] AAA_awright: jesusabdullah: That's the XML syntax you're seeing and it needs to die, NO ONE uses it
[23:41] jesusabdullah: That's a relief
[23:41] AAA_awright: Except maybe Mozilla
[23:41] jesusabdullah: Can the namespaces be made less deep?
[23:42] jesusabdullah: I see doap:thing everywhere, so is there a way to just have thing?
[23:42] jesusabdullah: I mean, that's not a deal-breaker or anything but that could be nice
[23:42] jesusabdullah: Anyways
[23:42] jesusabdullah: Good to know there rdf and xml aren't married
[23:43] AAA_awright: Well there's different namespaces you can use
[23:43] AAA_awright: You identify everything with URIs so that's a short way to express a URI
[23:43] jesusabdullah: hmm
[23:44] jesusabdullah: so they probably won't get any deeper hmm?
[23:44] AAA_awright: Unlike XML, which may be contextual (it means something different if the file is in one Git repository versus another), everything in RDF is globally applicable
[23:44] jesusabdullah: just the prefix to connect to a uri?
[23:44] AAA_awright: No, it's just prefix:component part
[23:44] AAA_awright: So in the header I have @prefix doap: <http://usefulinc.com/ns/doap#>
[23:45] AAA_awright: that means doap:Project == <http://usefulinc.com/ns/doap#Project>
[23:45] jesusabdullah: right
[23:45] jesusabdullah: I see now
[23:45] jesusabdullah: That's actually mildly neat!
[23:45] jesusabdullah: Is there a json/js-type syntax for this? That'd be really swell >:3
[23:45] AAA_awright: And anyone can use that URI, anywhere in the world, and it always means the same thing
[23:45] criswell has joined the channel
[23:45] AAA_awright: There is
[23:45] daaku has joined the channel
[23:45] jesusabdullah: example?
[23:46] jesusabdullah: I'd probably use that if I got into semantic web stuff
[23:46] AAA_awright: There's no standard, actually, but I use: {"subject": {"predicate": "object"}}
[23:46] jesusabdullah: but that's cause I'm a fanboi
[23:46] jesusabdullah: ah!
[23:46] jesusabdullah: That sounds like a reasonable approach
[23:46] AAA_awright: If you have more than one object for a predicate, you use: {"subject": {"predicate": ["object"]}
[23:47] mikeal has joined the channel
[23:47] AAA_awright: And actually you can type your objects with URIs, so you can say "this is an integer" or "This is an english-language literal" so there's one last thing: {type:"typeURI",value:"object"}
[23:47] AAA_awright: "object" is for URIs
[23:47] AAA_awright: that's what I use, that seems to be standard
[23:47] rchavik has joined the channel
[23:47] rchavik has joined the channel
[23:48] AAA_awright: you can also just have an Array of {subject:, predicate:, object:} triples too
[23:48] AAA_awright: but that's clunky
[23:48] Dulak has joined the channel
[23:50] jesusabdullah: You can have a hash of subjects, right? { "subject1": [object Object], "subject2": [object Object] }
[23:50] jesusabdullah: like that?
[23:50] jesusabdullah: It sounds like the important part of rdf is encoding sets of these triples
[23:52] Aria: Yeah. Triples being the only universal serialization of a graph.
[23:52] Aria: "this ... connects to ... that"
[23:54] AAA_awright: jesusabdullah: What you do is you create multiple resources and you give them names and values
[23:55] AAA_awright: so if subject1 isn't a URI you would go, { "http://example.com/subject1": { "name": "subject1", "value":[object Object] } }
[23:56] AAA_awright: actually, if subject1 isn't a URI then I can't do that, it would be:
[23:56] AAA_awright: so if subject1 isn't a URI you would go, { "http://example.com/subject1": { "name": {value:"subject1"}, "value":[object Object] } }
[23:56] AAA_awright: to show it's a string literal and not a URI

[23:59] AAA_awright: jesusabdullah: It's trivial to recover a table of name/value pairs, you would query for a pattern like this:
