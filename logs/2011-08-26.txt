[00:00] CoverSlide: but using spawn instead of exec, you can pipe the stdout of each process and do whatever instead of saving it to a buffer and clog up your memory

[00:00] DrMcKay: sechrist: but I've read about no-knock raids and things
[00:00] sechrist: DrMcKay: it is, and I'm having terrible problems with flash (on my mac, of course)
[00:00] sechrist: I shouldn't have upgraded

[01:21] bnoordhuis: we don't use the autoconf system right now
[01:21] cjheath: ahh, ok
[01:21] cjheath: I thought that configuration was faster than autoconf usually is :)
[01:21] bnoordhuis: yeah
[01:22] bnoordhuis: it's mostly because we're porting to windows
[01:22] DrMcKay: well, autoconf is outdated and not so portable
[01:22] bnoordhuis: and autotools doesn't work there (not that anyone has it installed anyway)
[01:22] cjheath: I'm going to need to cross-compile node onto Cortex A8 soo, which I believe has been done, but I'll need to understand how the build system works a bit better
[01:22] cjheath: autotools works on Windows if you build uder cygwin
[01:23] bnoordhuis: cygwin is exactly what we're trying to avoid :)
[01:23] DrMcKay: seriously, cygwin? it's slow!
[01:23] hornairs has joined the channel
[01:23] cjheath: right, good idea
[01:23] bnoordhuis: cjheath: re build system: it's waf + scons for v8 + make for libuv
[01:24] bnoordhuis: or gyp if you use the bleeding edge
[01:24] cjheath: Yeah, Ive seen that, but never used waf or scons before
[01:24] DrMcKay: waf is even nice
[01:24] cjheath: I've just done a git pull :)
[01:24] cjheath: so I assume gyp is in play
[01:24] tjholowaychuk: drudge: could clicking the reconnect thing in linkinus retain the channel selections?
[01:24] DrMcKay: I use it for all my projects lately
[01:25] cjheath: I'm not a python user, so I don't :)
[01:25] bnoordhuis: cjheath: gyp is optional atm
[01:25] bnoordhuis: default is still waf
[01:25] DrMcKay: cjheath: but it's easy and doesn't require any python knowledge

[01:27] mbutubuntu: hello folks, in the method fs.mkdir(path, mode)... what mode is?
[01:27] DrMcKay: bnoordhuis: why?
[01:27] bnoordhuis: DrMcKay: anytime i want to do something more complicated than just compiling files i have to dive into the waf source to find out how
[01:27] cjheath: what's cmake?
[01:28] bnoordhuis: and that's mostly because the documentation says 'do this' and when you do that, it crashes with an obscure error
[01:28] bnoordhuis: cjheath: an alternative build system, mostly used by the webos guys
[01:28] cjheath: too many moving parts :(
[01:28] bnoordhuis: yeah
[01:28] DrMcKay: bnoordhuis: most complicated thing I did in waf was linking libraries, so you're probably right
[01:28] bnoordhuis: that's why we're moving to gyp

[01:59] jesusabdullah: I was thinking, like, "cut out the middle man"
[01:59] jesusabdullah: pure client-side
[01:59] jesusabdullah: could be interesting but I don't think a web browser is equipped to do that without greasemonkey or something.
[01:59] jesusabdullah: That said, there are definitely tuio interfaces that work with greasemonkey or some such, so I'm sure that's possible with raw osc

[02:27] cjheath: They do, but they have more than one stack. Make sure your app is in the right one
[02:28] brainproxy: http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/node-js
[02:29] cjheath: Damn - Express wants {"node":">= 0.4.1 < 0.5.0"} - wont install using trunk node
[02:29] brainproxy: ^^ indicates web sock not supported in "Cedar" stack

[02:57] cjheath: Have you looked at "npm install --help

[02:57] cjheath: ?
[02:57] beezey: io = require ('socket.io').listen 8080
[02:57] Chani: yep
[02:57] Chani: ...oh, I appear to be scrolled up. o.0
[02:57] cjheath: No options at all (hence my request about -g)
[02:58] tjholowaychuk: cjheath yeah that's no good
[02:58] cjheath: ACTION is new to node, not to dev or JS
[02:58] tjholowaychuk: if you dont need to use 0.5.x i would skip that for now though
[02:58] tjholowaychuk: unless you have a reason for using the unstable stuff
[02:58] Chani: I'm also misreading words. damnit. when is someone going to write a debugger for my brain? ;P

[03:05] tjholowaychuk: probably not, i think a few people wrote support libs before last time
[03:05] cjheath: Bash is a mess, b/c is extends the Boure shell which was a mess. Why is that such a surprise?
[03:05] tjholowaychuk: i dont know
[03:05] cjheath: * Bourne
[03:05] tjholowaychuk: cjheath haha i never peeked at the code
[03:06] cjheath: No, I mean the syntax is a mess, so of course the grammar is :)
[03:06] Chani: node knockout? :)
[03:06] tjholowaychuk: yeah, it must be much larger than i know because there's no reason the grammar should be ~7k
[03:06] Nexxy: you just don't do enough psychedelics to understand the syntax
[03:06] tjholowaychuk: LOC
[03:06] tjholowaychuk: haha
[03:06] tjholowaychuk: yeah it's pretty fucked up
[03:07] jamescarr: bash
[03:07] jamescarr: bah
[03:07] tjholowaychuk: some stuff is handy but the substitution stuff etc is retarded
[03:07] jamescarr: I use zsh with oh-my-zsh
[03:07] jamescarr: it really rocks
[03:07] Nexxy: we're talking about something that was written in the 1970's

[03:09] jerrysv: still go back to tcsh for loops sometimes
[03:09] bnoordhuis: i hate it with a passion now
[03:09] jerrysv: i don't mind it. use bash at this point, but no real preference
[03:09] cjheath: I worked with csh for a while, many years ago, when it was the only alternative to bourne shell (there was no ksh nor bash)
[03:09] jerrysv: can also slip in and out of vi/emacs with ease at this point
[03:09] cjheath: switched to ksh in about 1987
[03:10] cjheath: and bash after that
[03:10] jerrysv: but for serious work, i'll use awk/sed
[03:10] bnoordhuis: hah no, i've never grokked emacs
[03:10] jerrysv: ah, yes, way too much time in /sbin/sh and /bin/sh

[03:47] blueadept: jamescarr: how so?
[03:47] jamescarr: difficult debugging because it doesn't give me precise line numbers
[03:47] blueadept: yeah i know what you mean

[10:56] industrial: When are require()'s done? before runtime?
[10:56] H4ns: industrial: no, requre() is just a normal function.
[10:57] industrial: right
[10:57] H4ns: industrial: there is no such thing as "runtime" with javascript.
[10:57] H4ns: industrial: (if you want to contrast it with "compile time")
[10:58] industrial: well i was wondering if it might cache things to prevent unneeded loading
[10:58] H4ns: industrial: it does.
[10:58] industrial: okay, thats fine then
[10:58] industrial: so if I include file A from B and C, file A will only run once?
[10:58] Layke: Does this actually exist? http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.5.0/api/dgram.html
[10:58] H4ns: industrial: no.  caching is per using module.
[10:58] Layke: Iḿ trying to allow PHP to send messages to my node.js server.
[10:59] Layke: Would this be the correct way?
[10:59] SubStack: industrial: correct
[10:59] SubStack: H4ns: what
[10:59] H4ns: SubStack: no?
[10:59] H4ns: SubStack: then i've misinterpreted the documentation, let me check
[10:59] SubStack: ACTION performs an experiment
[10:59] Nexxy: SubStack, it is 4AM young man don't you have school in the morning?!
[10:59] H4ns: SubStack: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.11/api/all.html#require
[11:00] H4ns: SubStack: i thought this was clear, but i'm not a native english speaker, so i might be wrong.
[11:00] Nexxy: H4ns, if it means anything you type english better than many native speakers
[11:00] industrial: "Modules are cached after the first time they are loaded. This means (among other things) that every call to require('foo') will get exactly the same object returned, if it would resolve to the same file."
[11:00] industrial: ACTION should read the docs
[11:00] H4ns: Nexxy: thanks, but still.
[11:00] SubStack: H4ns: I'm confirming my initial claim that A will only run once
[11:00] SubStack: I'll gist it
[11:01] H4ns: SubStack: so you are saying the documentation is misleading when it says that require "is local to each module"?

[11:03] H4ns: industrial: sorry for the false info :/

[11:39] gurleyman has joined the channel
[11:40] anubhaw: Lorentz: I expected node.js to be performing better than java/python particularly in this case
[11:41] chjj: anubhaw: is that a zeromq binding?
[11:41] massivebiz has joined the channel
[11:41] anubhaw: chjj: yes
[11:42] chjj: anubhaw: as far as i know the crossover between js and linked machine code, or "c++ land" is fairly expensive
[11:43] chjj: i have no idea how that binding is written, but judging node based on a third party module doesnt seem to be the best to way go about doing it
[11:43] jzacsh has joined the channel
[11:43] jzacsh has joined the channel
[11:44] chjj: if you were instead judging it by nodes native tcp interface, then i might be concerned
[11:45] Lorentz: And really, does it matter, you're putting the cart before the horse.
[11:45] Lorentz: Write app first. Then compare. There's no point to compare it like that, there's always time for optimisation.
[11:45] Lorentz: That's not even counting how different things are.
[11:46] anubhaw: chjj: zeromq node binding used is pretty common one . but I somewhat agree to your point. looks like I need to do some tetsing with native tcp interface.
[11:47] chjj: anubhaw: that would be better, i would be interested to see that
[11:48] chjj: but a lot of the time, c++ bindings to v8 can be slow, its better to write most things in JS
[11:48] anubhaw: Lorentz: The performance hit claimed in that post is pretty high. Moreover I wanted to do some research/ get others views before I actually make technology decision.
[11:49] anubhaw: chjj: thanks for your input. I'll try out that 
[11:49] andree has joined the channel
[11:49] chjj: anubhaw: i think it might be part of the reason most popular database bindings to node are written in pure JS
[11:49] chjj: not only do people not want to compile things
[11:49] chjj: but it actually has the potential to be faster
[11:49] toki_kanno has joined the channel
[11:50] chjj: i think ry gave a talk about this a while back, when coding the buffer objects for node, he noticed that they were actually *a lot* faster if he wrote most everything in JS as opposed to c++
[11:51] chjj: so he did what he needed to in c++ land, but mostly implemented everything else in JS

[13:36] bnoordhuis: i think that one of the reasons that we don't extend Error in core is that the semantics are icky

[13:38] zilch_ has joined the channel
[13:38] evg: bnoordhuis: probably checking err.name is the way
[13:38] evg: cuz I need to return a different code depending on an error type

[14:10] slip has joined the channel
[14:11] Sembiance: NodeBleed: take a look at the HTTP headers sent/received by using the Firebug or chrome 'net' panels. that can give a good hint. Also examine the nginx logs (both error and access) and also add some console.log() statements in your node.js server to determine if the request is even getting there or not

[15:05] DrMcKay: dingomanatee: so why are you using it?
[15:05] zilch_ has joined the channel
[15:05] dingomanatee: Well, its probably better than MySQL for this purpose - and I think the data is just too big for couch. 
[15:06] Sembiance: dingomanatee: if you want to store more structured data... maybe http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/
[15:06] dingomanatee: someone suggested Redis - that would be my next experiment. 
[15:06] DrMcKay: dingomanatee: well, Redis might fit beter
[15:06] Sembiance: dingomanatee: that was me, but redis only makes sense if your data set fits in RAM and you need blazing fast access to it (and even better if you change the data once in a while)
[15:06] losing has joined the channel

[15:08] zilch_ has joined the channel
[15:08] dingomanatee: I'm making WebGL terrain out of it. but at this point the data is still very coarse - I am likely going to take it and interpolate up to 16 times more data from this binary chunk

[15:08] Sembiance: dingomanatee: got a link? sounds like something neat to look at

[15:08] cjm has joined the channel
[15:09] dingomanatee: https://gist.github.com/1173528 is the raw data dump
[15:09] dingomanatee: I think I just need to put it back in a file buffer and save it in file chunks. 
[15:10] Sembiance: dingomanatee: well with all those integers, mongodb is almost certainly not the correct storage choice.
[15:10] DrMcKay: dingomanatee: it seems like it definitely won't fit right into Mongo
[15:10] dingomanatee: yeah. 
[15:11] dingomanatee: I need it in 2d arrays when I process it but I guess I'll have to unpack it every time I need it

[15:11] burningdog has joined the channel
[15:11] Sembiance: dingomanatee: well if your goal is to output something with WebGL, you should pre-convert this data into whatever format you can most easily work with to display with WebGL. Then just chunk that up and save it, probably as snappy encoded files
[15:12] dingomanatee: Probably. But if the end product is still massively wasteful I might as well just stick to binary blocks of data in files. 
[15:12] ckpcw has left the channel
[15:12] dingomanatee: Snappy will be nice, as there is bound to be a lot of repetition of values.

[16:29] DrMcKay: would it be responsible to propose node.js for Fedora packaging?
[16:29] CoverSlide: with an async function, you have to have a callback, it just doesn't do anything without one
[16:29] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[16:30] zilch_ has joined the channel
[16:30] CoverSlide: so you really shouldn't have a use-case where cbk is undefined

[16:31] rmcastil has joined the channel
[16:31] markdaws has joined the channel
[16:31] CoverSlide: also, if(typeof cbk === 'function') is much better at detecting whether a variable is a function, because it it's a number, you'll have a TypeError
[16:32] eldios: oof
[16:32] jesster7 has joined the channel
[16:32] eldios: you're right
[16:32] eldios: I'll change that now
[16:32] eldios: I upadted the gist meanwhile
[16:32] CoverSlide: so I'd catch that before the call to exec at all

[16:38] eldios: CoverSlide, no.. I don't want to catch it *before* the exec
[16:38] eldios: since if it's a function
[16:38] jergason: hello node friends
[16:38] eldios: then you should exec the cb
[16:38] creationix has joined the channel
[16:38] slip has joined the channel
[16:38] eldios: instead if there's no cb supplied
[16:38] markdaws has joined the channel
[16:38] eldios: the stdout should be simply returned
[16:38] eldios: (and this is the part which is not working)
[16:38] CoverSlide: but if there is no cb supplied, then the function does nothing
[16:39] CoverSlide: because you can't return from an async function
[16:39] CoverSlide: it is just simply impossible
[16:39] anubhaw has joined the channel
[16:39] CoverSlide: that's the nature of async programming
[16:39] nibblebo_ has joined the channel
[16:39] eldios: eh.. that's the "problem" I'm trying to workaround
[16:39] CoverSlide: there is no workaround
[16:39] CoverSlide: whatever you want to do with stdout, you write in the callback
[16:39] hybsch has left the channel
[16:40] CoverSlide: because returning things only works synchronously, not asynchronously

[16:42] dwt: Something like

[16:42] eldios: which would probably be heavier and clumsier but possibly more effective and powerful

[19:17] daan: ok, cool
[19:17] tjholowaychuk: daan not that you cant use express, they are just unrelated
[19:18] daan: I could use express to keep an open connection?

[19:21] daan: tjholowaychuk: I'm not sure if i understood you correctly. Could express do the job? Cause I'd like that. I'm using it for the rest of the installation, so that would keep it nice and simple
[19:21] __sorin__ has joined the channel
[19:22] tjholowaychuk: daan socket.io / express are just totally separate things, you could do long polling etc with express
[19:22] tjholowaychuk: but socketio does a lot more
[19:22] cying has joined the channel
[19:22] tjholowaychuk: daan express is for routing/views/services etc

[19:27] daan: Allright, in that case I need another piece of advice :)

[19:46] tvaldes: Hi! I built a small system in jQuery/PHP which warns an inactive user their session is about to expire, and it gives them a few options (stay logged in, extend for 15 mins, and logout). Since it's purely on the client, there are issues when multiple tabs/windows are open. Does this sound like a great use for node.js? I'm totally new to node, can someone provide me some general direction on how I should go about handling this and man
[19:46] NodeBuddy: Actually, even six will do it
[19:46] caolanm has joined the channel
[19:47] anubhaw has joined the channel
[19:47] context: nodebuddy: most browsers limit the # of requests per host, id ask why you are firing off that many at once to begin with

[19:47] NodeBuddy: context: Sure, but it shouldn't be timing out

[19:49] DTrejo: well, mostly what izs is doing

[19:50] NodeBuddy: context: They might be cutting connections when I open more than five or something
[19:50] DrMcKay: DTrejo: so, you say it's actually useful?
[19:50] antono has joined the channel
[19:50] DrMcKay: DTrejo: and that we should port it to node?
[19:51] slip has joined the channel
[19:51] DTrejo: DrMcKay: well, it seems helpful. it would encourage module authors to write tests, include readme, have a license, etc
[19:51] DTrejo: my team's node knockout project is related to this 
[19:51] context: nodebuddy: a lot of intelligent people will do that for any server
[19:51] NodeBuddy: ACTION is going to try doing requests on the same server.
[19:52] context: nodebuddy: and IF that is so, what you said earlier does NOT hold true.
[19:52] NodeBuddy: context: So maybe it's even Linode?
[19:52] context: nodebuddy: if the firewall is blocking it, you never get to the request let alone response.end()
[19:52] NodeBuddy: What doesn't hold true?
[19:52] mikeal has joined the channel
[19:52] NodeBuddy: context: Well, then the latter doesn't hold true because I tested this.
[19:53] NodeBuddy: context: I do 12 requests, I got 12 response.end()s
[19:53] context: + the initial request ?
[19:53] DrMcKay: DTrejo: so you're writing it? cool
[19:53] NodeBuddy: No, 12 XHRs = 12 response.ends()

[19:56] DTrejo: DrMcKay: I think all the easy and simple ones are the first ones to borrow from what they do
[19:56] DTrejo: "does it contain a test directory, with tests in it"

[20:25] context: stanlysomanly: possibly race condition or code was changed that one time you ran the test
[20:25] context: stanlysomanly: or you have a form of randomness somewhere in the test
[20:25] context: we have an issue here sometimes with tests and Faker and unique constraint validations
[20:26] StanlySoManly: the code i'm testing is very simple. it's just an email validation routine that returns true/false i'd hope there aren't many race conditions possible there. :)

[20:28] StanlySoManly: i know the code didn't change because i didn't fetch new code. oh well, it sounds like all the possibilities are that there's something screwy with my VM. just wanted to make sure that was the right assumption. it didn't sound at all like something that would be in node, but just wanted to make sure there wasn't something that was smarter than me. :)  
[20:28] context: stanlysomanly: maybe you accidently changed the addr it was testing for that one test ?

They added it so that it may reference the same collection every time, but it's advised to use DBRef only if you need a field reference different collections. Wondering if it creates *that* much overhead.

[22:29] bnoordhuis: adamfsh: what do you mean?

[22:29] adamfsh: so I can't end the response until the request was finished

[22:29] adamfsh: so I need to abort the request even before it was finished :D
[22:30] mnutt: bnoordhuis: it's http/1.1, but doesn't have a content-length because the backend continues to send data until the client disconnects.  I assume that makes it invalid?
[22:30] adamfsh: I tried, request.connection.destroy();
[22:30] Sorella has joined the channel

[22:47] AvianFlu: I thought you were asking about aborting outgoing requests, I must have misunderstood
[22:47] vikstrous has joined the channel
[22:47] chovy: in my node script it looks fine, except the one json line is now split to one line for each property. I suspect this is what is breaking my response.write("data: "+value+"\n\n"); back to the client socket.
[22:48] chovy: does that make sense?
[22:48] TheJH: chovy, you're sending newline-delimited JSON fragments?
[22:48] slip_ has joined the channel
[22:49] TheJH: chovy, this is NOT valid JSON: foo: "bar"

[22:51] TheJH: Nuck, that, too, but you also can't just insert newlines where you want to in newline-delimited JSON!
[22:51] chovy: i'm no
[22:51] tuhoojabotti: eww
[22:51] chovy: i'm not inserting.
[22:51] tuhoojabotti: newline-delimited JSON?!?!!?
[22:51] tuhoojabotti: That's just sick.
[22:51] chovy: do i need to JSON.stringify it?
[22:51] TheJH: tuhoojabotti, no, it's how many streaming APIs work
[22:52] TheJH: chovy, response.write("data: "+value+"\n\n"); is wrong
[22:52] tuhoojabotti: Streaming is sick.
[22:52] tuhoojabotti: It's like a stream of vomit!
[22:52] tuhoojabotti: ACTION should go to bed.

[22:53] TheJH: ACTION puts tuhoojabotti on the "trolls" list
[22:53] tuhoojabotti: :(
[22:54] Nuck: TheJH: How about just raw sockets with a JSON object for each tweet, each followed by a \r\n?
[22:54] Nuck: Not a streaming object
[22:54] tmpvar: tuhoojabotti, is it online somewhere?
[22:54] tuhoojabotti: ACTION puts TheJH to the list of people with no sense of humour.
[22:54] TheJH: Nuck, you're taling about newline-delimited JSON
[22:54] Nuck: adamfshh: I use this thing which relies on the HTML5 APIs to deal with shit
[22:54] tuhoojabotti: tmpvar: Yes.
[22:54] Nuck: TheJH: Eh, really?
[22:54] TheJH: *talking
[22:54] Nuck: That's not so bad
[22:55] adamfshh: Nuck what thing?
[22:55] Nuck: adamfshh: Essentially, it just dumps the file in the body of a POST request, which I then pipe to a file using Express middleware
[22:55] Nuck: I forget, lemme see

[22:56] tuhoojabotti: Finland still.
[22:56] chovy: TheJH: Why is response.write("data: "+value+"\n\n"); wrong?
[22:56] TheJH: chovy, because "data": 1 is invalid json
[22:56] Zuardi has joined the channel
[22:56] TheJH: chovy, that needs to be inside an object
[22:56] chovy: TheJH: that's not json.
[22:57] chovy: that is an event stream
[22:57] adamfshh: @Nuck and do you know how to end the file uploading if for example you want just .PNG files? Or the size of the file is too large ?
[22:57] mikeal: sup
[22:57] chovy: the value is the json object, "data: { "foo":"bar"}\n\n" is the event data.
[22:58] Validatorian has joined the channel
[22:58] Nuck: adamfshh: The thing I use is http://valums.com/ajax-upload/, and I implemented it in Node by piping the data events from the body to a file

[22:59] adamfshh: Nuck : but do you check the file types and file size limit in server side?

[23:00] achiu has joined the channel
[23:00] tuhoojabotti: Never judge people!
[23:00] chovy: TheJH: it works. I think hyou are confusing the response sent.
[23:00] Nuck: adamfshh: Not yet, and it can't detect the size of files, but I can check filetype by checking the GET parameter qq uploader uses.
[23:00] chovy: i'm using websockets.
[23:00] Validatorian: I'm getting: Object #<Object> has no method 'bodyParser' -- express 2.4.6, connect 1.6.3, node 0.4.11 -- server.js is here: https://github.com/dgoujard/node-boilerplate/blob/master/server.js
[23:01] cjm has joined the channel
[23:01] Nuck: It shoves the filename in a GET parameter, so you just parse out the extension and immediately fail if it's the wrong type
[23:01] Nuck: I guess if you have a filesize limit you could keep track of the length as it's streamed to you and then if it hits a certain length, just die
[23:02] adamfshh: But Nuck if if fails how to do end the request?
[23:02] Metal3d has joined the channel
[23:02] adamfshh: beacuse the file is uploading, you have to stop it 
[23:02] adamfshh: my problem is here, I don't know how to stop the upload :)
[23:02] Nuck: adamfshh: req.end(false)
[23:02] Nuck: Assuming you want to return false
[23:02] adamfshh: Nuck do you mean res.end() ?
[23:03] Nuck: Yeah, that :P
[23:03] adamfshh: buuut res.end will be sent after the request was finished
[23:03] adamfshh: am I right?
[23:03] Nuck: adamfshh: Req fires end when it's done.
[23:03] Validatorian: I'm getting: Object #<Object> has no method 'bodyParser' -- express 2.4.6, connect 1.6.3, node 0.4.11 -- server.js is here: https://github.com/dgoujard/node-boilerplate/blob/master/server.js -- anyone know why?

[23:13] adamfshh: I have a very dirty and unsafe idea, I could target a the form to an Iframe, and I could long poll for the errors, and If if an error is fired during the upload, then I could delete the iFrame from the DOM. that way the Request would close just like by closing the browser. But this can be figured out by hackers, but at least I could check errors. :S
