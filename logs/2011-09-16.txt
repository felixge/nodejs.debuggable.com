[01:11] devaholic: next your error
[01:12] godsflaw: on the socket.connect call, if the hostname resolves to a CNAME with multiple results, will it cycle through those results on other calls to that function, or does it cache one address.
[01:12] devaholic: app.error(function(err, req, res, next){
[01:12] nuck: Thinking of the best way to handle errors
[01:12] devaholic: and throw that in
[01:12] godsflaw: I am using a connection pool, and I need to know if I have to test all servers, or if I can use one hostname
[01:12] nuck: devaholic: it's app.use with a 4-arg thing
[01:12] nuck: But that doesn't work in async
[01:12] devaholic: what
[01:12] nuck: devaholic: It won't catch async errors
[01:12] nuck: Plain and simple
[01:13] devaholic: express errorHandler =/= app.error
[01:13] nuck: All it does is try catch

[01:16] nuck: But I can't throw
[01:17] devaholic: why are you throwing
[01:17] nuck: I want to be able to asynchronously call on the error handler middleware system in Express
[01:18] devaholic: okay
[01:18] devaholic: so next()
[01:18] nuck: I might just hafta wait until tj gets on, and ask him :/
[01:18] nuck: devaholic: huh?
[01:18] JaKWaC has joined the channel
[01:19] nuck: devaholic: I think you don't understand what I'm doing.  I want to call on the errorHandler functionality (see http://expressjs.com/guide.html#error-handling ) in Express, but do so through async channels
[01:19] nuck: So I'm building a utility that should do this for me
[01:19] devaholic: instead of throw new Error('herp') do next(new Error('derp'))?
[01:20] nuck: And provide something like res.sendError()
[01:20] nuck: devaholic: Where the fuck is next() coming from?
[01:20] nuck: This is in a route
[01:20] devaholic: maybe i dont understand... i just dont see why next'ing your error isnt going to work
[01:20] nuck: devaholic: Because /there is no next/
[01:21] nuck: This is in a route
[01:21] nuck: Not a middleware
[01:21] jacobolus has joined the channel
[01:21] devaholic: thats why you have an additional app.use after app.router

[01:21] nuck: It doesn't catch async errors

[01:22] nuck: If I throw in a callback, it won't
[01:22] devaholic: next it, dont throw..
[01:22] nuck: devaholic: Because, for the 15th time, /there is no next/

[01:23] nuck: devaholic: Last I checked there wasn't

[01:41] godsflaw: the answer to my question earlier sums up to: each call to Socket.connect(), where the hostname maps to multiple addresses, will randomly choose a CNAME on each call.

[01:42] godsflaw: :)
[01:42] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[01:42] ts310 has left the channel
[01:43] godsflaw: the long answer is that this is because the net code just uses the DNS package's lookup routine to resolve an address, which returns the first result (running this in a little test shows that it will return a different result each call because of how DNS presents multiple addresses).

[04:29] nuck: CoverSlide: Doesn't grab 404
[04:29] nuck: I'm using the 4-arg middleware, since tj removed the server.error in the repo
[04:30] nuck: So I assume it'll disappear soon enough
[04:30] CoverSlide: Error throwing doesn't necessarily mean 404
[04:30] nuck: CoverSlide: Well, I know, but I want 404 to direct to my error handlers
[04:31] nuck: CoverSlide: That example really doesn't make it clear that /404 isn't a "magic path" either

[04:34] CoverSlide: you could have var e = new Error(messsage);e.type = 'NotFound';next(e)
[04:34] CoverSlide: and use the `type` property to determine error type
[04:35] nuck: CoverSlide: I copied the code in that example to set up a prototype based on Error
[04:35] nuck: And now I've got 404, 400, 500, and 501
[04:36] nuck: And I added this.code to each
[04:36] nuck: (with the error codes)
[04:38] Lukeas has joined the channel
[04:38] nuck: CoverSlide: It's this snippet that makes me feel icky: `app.get('*', function (req, res, next) { next(new error.NotFound); });
[04:38] nuck: And I think it's pretty easy to see why.
[04:38] nuck: It's a catchall page

[05:59] mil_: i have what should be a simple problem
[05:59] mil_: Schema.pre('save', function (next) {   function () { // set "this.key" variable  } })
[05:59] mil_: how would i set the variable?
[06:00] CoverSlide: !closures
[06:00] CoverSlide: oh, wrong channel
[06:00] trevorgreen: hah.
[06:00] mil_: haha
[06:00] trevorgreen: mil_ I don't know.. 
[06:00] trevorgreen: what are you trying to set. 
[06:01] trevorgreen: this.key?
[06:01] trevorgreen: this.key = next?
[06:01] Aphelion has joined the channel
[06:01] mil_: the "this" has been taken by the other function
[06:01] trevorgreen: so you are passing next in and then running another function.
[06:02] mil_: Its for mongoose. "this" for the Schema is the database collection and i need to change the value
[06:02] trevorgreen: So you have a scope problem.
[06:02] mil_: and i have a function inside it that replaces "this"
[06:02] mil_: yes
[06:02] mil_: scope problem
[06:03] trevorgreen: Can you pass in a reference?
[06:03] trevorgreen: function(next, this)
[06:03] caffine has joined the channel
[06:03] cjheath has joined the channel
[06:04] mil_: no, because it is actually Schema.pre('save', function (next) {   APLUGINFUNCTION(CALLBACK() {})
[06:04] trevorgreen: and it doesn't pass anything to that internal function.
[06:04] trevorgreen: humm..
[06:05] mil_: would var t = this; on the outside work?
[06:06] trevorgreen: Don't know, but you have sent me a reading. need to refresh my understanding of the scope.
[06:06] CoverSlide: mil_:  yes
[06:07] CoverSlide: var self = this; is something you see a lot of
[06:07] CoverSlide: or you can add a `.bind(this)` to the function expression you want to call
[06:07] CoverSlide: but afaik that's a bit slower
[06:07] mil_: and when i modify it it will modify the "this" variable? because i remember trying this before and for some reason running into difficulty
[06:08] trevorgreen: Coverslide, so you can set that global to this in and then just use it in the callback and it will find this.
[06:08] trevorgreen: That sounds right.
[06:09] mil_: to modify it to though?
[06:09] trevorgreen: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3852239/storing-a-mongoose-node-js-orm-query-result
[06:09] CoverSlide: function(next){var self = this; asyncFunction(function callback(){/* self will refer to the `this` of the calling function */})}
[06:10] trevorgreen: That is how they show accessing an external var there.
[06:10] CoverSlide: ^ that should work
[06:10] CoverSlide: and modifying it will modify the `this` in the top scope. asynchronously of course
[06:10] mil_: !ok, thanks

[06:35] tonymilne: (i am actually factoring leap years already, thx)
[06:36] tonymilne: But, then i wasn't sure if doing such in a $where condition meant i had to not write to the collection at the same time.

[13:17] rurufufuss: cheers, I better take a look at what that is then
[13:17] deedubs: yeah then you'll be able to run 'npm install'
[13:17] slicky: rurufufuss, since some of the modules have to be compiled, you shouldn't just copy the node_modules directory over. Do what deedubs said and use the package.json file :)
[13:18] deedubs: rurufufuss: a really simple one looks like this https://gist.github.com/1220708
[13:18] rurufufuss: yeah, I was wondering if there was some way to export the list of installed packages and reinstall it on the deploy site
[13:19] rurufufuss: only my 2nd/3rd attentive day on node.js
[13:20] hernan: rurufufuss: the good thing about using package.json is that most deployment platforms understand it. dotcloud, nodester, heroku, they all can read it and install the dependencies for you.
[13:20] hernan: rurufufuss: it also keep you repo clean and any dev can git clone and run npm install on the root of your project and be ready to go.

[14:36] tomtomaso has joined the channel
[14:37] Glenjamin: DrMcKay: not function wrapping imo
[14:37] Glenjamin: since params can be deprecated
[14:37] Glenjamin: or even certain values
[14:37] Glenjamin: like "UTF-8" for encoding
[14:37] Glenjamin: instead of "utf8"
[14:37] DrMcKay: Glenjamin: still makes sense
[14:38] DrMcKay: Glenjamin: wrappers can take arguments
[14:38] Glenjamin: yeah, but its messier
[14:38] Glenjamin: simply calling util.deprecate("message") insead of console.warn("message") is nicer imo

[14:48] Glenjamin: DrMcKay: in general it's worth having it marked deprecated for one minor version
[14:48] c4milo has joined the channel
[14:48] Glenjamin: so for instance, to remove require.paths in 0.5, it would raise a warning in 0.4.x
[14:49] Glenjamin: but the main reason for that issue is that some things are being deprecated and just printing to stderr, which makes them hard to trap and hard to suppress warnings when you know you dont care
[14:50] Glenjamin: for instance: https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/sys.js
[14:50] DrMcKay: ah, a node --no-deprecated which wouldn't output those would be nic
[14:50] DrMcKay: *nice
[14:50] DrMcKay: and this warning is my fault
[14:51] Glenjamin: having warnings is good, having them forcefully print to stderr is bad imo
[14:51] baudehlo: agreed
[14:51] mc_greeny: in a paper (http://www.usenix.org/event/usenix99/full_papers/banga/banga.pdf) they said that "The select() mechanism works well for small-scale applications, but scales poorly as the number of ﬁle descriptors increases. [...] the traditional implementation of select() can be improved, the poor scalability is inherent in the design".

[15:00] Glenjamin: you could auto-load models easily enough
[15:01] Glenjamin: but explicit is better than implicit usually
[15:01] DrMcKay: Industrial: barista router is a win for REST
[15:01] Glenjamin: and since you don't unload things, you'd only get autoloader gains if you have slow startup
[15:01] Glenjamin: which isn't a problem so much in node

[15:03] avih has joined the channel
[15:03] Renegade001 has joined the channel
[15:03] Industrial: Glenjamin: the gain from an autoloader would be not having to type out the require's and knowing you have access to your app components (eg models). Mongoose already has a loading mechanism though (mongoose.model('MyModel'))
[15:04] colinclark has joined the channel
[15:04] Glenjamin: not having to type out require is a bad thing

[15:05] softdrink has joined the channel
[15:05] Glenjamin: and when you have a running application and you call a method on a class/module, it's actually pretty hard to find out where that method is defined

[15:07] Industrial: doing it via requires*
[15:07] Glenjamin: i like Ruby, but its lack of explicit modules is a bit i dislike
[15:07] Glenjamin: nope
[15:07] Glenjamin: because require points to somewhere
[15:07] Industrial: thats just convention vs configuration
[15:07] Industrial: I _know_ where my models are
[15:07] robi42 has joined the channel
[15:07] shanebo has joined the channel
[15:07] Industrial: you configure it by requiring explicitly, I'd say do it explictly;
[15:07] jetienne: node rocks.
[15:08] Glenjamin: require 'something' adds Something to global
[15:08] Glenjamin: then every other ruby script has access to Something, regardless of whether it required it
[15:08] Venom_X has joined the channel
[15:08] Industrial: It's not very DRY to type out the requires one by one, and since the NodeJS server will be running and using all models in the application anyway (I hope so) you could prettymuch make them globals from the bootup, and have access to them everywhere
[15:08] Glenjamin: while you can technically do that in Node, nothing does
[15:08] Glenjamin: Industrial: one controller should generally use one model
[15:08] markwubben has joined the channel
[15:09] Glenjamin: that model might use a few other models for relations
[15:09] Glenjamin: but no one script should use loads and loads of models
[15:10] fson has joined the channel
[15:10] Industrial: hm.

[16:04] smathy: NeedHelp… not sure about the language in your question about client.html - "local server"?  But re static files you can either use a non-node web server to serve them, like nginx, or use a static file handler to let node serve them for you.

[18:05] TheJH: thisissami, try "utf8"
[18:05] TheJH: thisissami, it depends on the encoding used in the file. for files created on linux, utf8 should work
[18:05] thisissami: ok i was wondering about that. utf8 will essentially mean (for my purposes) string instead of buffer?

[18:07] divoxx: I'm working on a decent way to pack and unpack data into a buffer, so i need more details for reading the buffer and reconstructing the data

[18:08] `3rdEden: pquerna TheJH thanks!

[19:36] JaKWaC: Ya, I was hoping for a RPM that I could use --prefix on.
[19:36] JaKWaC: For me RPMs are nice as we can run builds with jenkins and put them in our repo so we can access the builds anywhere on our network.

[20:47] omni5cience: :P
[20:47] qbert65536: dheenu, and ignore people that say you dont need an IDE
[20:47] jamescarr: qbert65536, really!?
[20:47] tommg: or emacs
[20:47] qbert65536: jamescarr, totally
[20:48] jamescarr: qbert65536, I am guessing IntelliJ supports it to then since PHPStorm is based on it?
[20:48] gkatsev: webstorm supports node?
[20:48] dheenu: @jamescarr the thing is i am not very good at js
[20:48] gkatsev: jamescarr: probably
[20:48] PastorBones: I was able to get node and npm to install under CYGWIN, but now I'm getting the ECONNREFUSED when trying to install packages via npm. I created the /etc/resolve.conf file with the google nameservers and I can ping registry.npmjs.org

[20:48] omni5cience: well to be fair you done _need_ an IDE, but I'm just kidding around
[20:48] gkatsev: jamescarr: intellij is now free if you don't need J2EE.
[20:49] isaacs: it's so bad.
[20:49] isaacs: jamescarr: ^
[20:49] PastorBones: thanx isaacs, I'll give vmware a go then
[20:49] jamescarr: isaacs, not as good as a real unix environment
[20:49] omni5cience: s/done/don't/
[20:49] gkatsev: jamescarr: take a look at Portable Ubuntu
[20:49] Draggor: virtualbox is amazing
[20:49] brianc: yeah virtualbox is the way to go
[20:49] PastorBones: virtualbox better than vmware?
[20:49] isaacs: jamescarr, PastorBones: that's to the help from deanlandolt, we may see a slightly kludged-together version that works with msysutils next weekish
[20:49] jamescarr: gkatsev, if I could use ubuntu I would... it's a *cough* corporate environment ;)
[20:49] Draggor: Easy to use, great performance
[20:49] dheenu: @gkatsev thanks
[20:49] Draggor: runs on everything
[20:49] isaacs: PastorBones: so, if you have git, then you'll already have what you need.
[20:50] gkatsev: jamescarr: "Portable Ubuntu" it's a product. it uses the co-linux architecture to run ubuntu inside of windows
[20:50] brianc: PastorBones: virtual box is free, can host linux or windows on top of windows, linux, or mac
[20:50] Draggor: It's interop with the host OS has gotten pretty dang nice too
[20:50] PastorBones: well, I fell in love with node.js last night and I'm itching to get something written :D
[20:50] Draggor: Just be sure to install the guest additions once you've got the VM installed
[20:50] jamescarr: what's a good description of process.nextTick?
[20:50] jmoyers has joined the channel
[20:50] dheenu: I've just started to play with node
[20:50] brianc: PastorBones: sweet. higly recommend virtual box + ubuntu if you're new to linux
[20:50] jamescarr: updating some training docs and I'm trying to revise my current statements on it
[20:50] dheenu: its is cool
[20:50] gkatsev: or just install a server linux on the vm and ssh into it

[20:51] gkatsev: jamescarr: http://sourceforge.net/projects/portableubuntu/
[20:51] gkatsev: PastorBones: dual boot ftw
[20:51] PastorBones: ACTION <3 ubuntu though
[20:51] astropirate: PastorBones: dual boot
[20:51] astropirate: just do go the appple route :p *shrugs*
[20:51] brianc: PastorBones: just run virtualbox on windows and host ubuntu there...then you can node your heart out without having to deal with the cygwyn madness
[20:52] PastorBones: astropirate, did you just suggest MAC?

[20:53] jamescarr: brianc, thanks... that reads better
[20:54] DrMcKay: well, it can even do a window manager.

[20:54] jamescarr: brianc, do you think it's still a valid statement though to say it's a good way to have something be called asynchronously?
[20:54] astropirate: *apple's 
[20:54] DrMcKay: I'm wondering if do MBPs really get so hot as people say

[20:55] smathy: Only a LAPtop if you have an asbestos lap.
[20:55] brianc: jamescarr: yeah, process.nextTick is the best way to ensure a function gets called async. when you call process.nextTick(function() { ... }) that function will _NOT_ execute until the next event loop cycle
[20:55] DrMcKay: lol, to be more precise: does vim + node.js get them hot?
[20:55] xerox: maybe the Air is different tho
[20:55] smathy: DrMcKay… no.
[20:55] smathy: DrMcKay… video.
[20:55] DrMcKay: smathy: like video in video games or like video in youtube?
[20:56] smathy: Even just in youtube.
[20:56] gkatsev: unless you have like 50000 vim instances and 5000000000 node instances running
[20:56] jamescarr: brianc, hmmm.. what determines the next event loop cycle?
[20:56] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[20:56] brianc: jamescarr: when the current event loop cycle is done. :)
[20:56] JaKWaC: My MacBook was getting crazy hot quick for the past few days.
[20:56] smathy: gkatsev… and all those node instances are responding to an equally high number of events.
[20:56] gkatsev: it's because they dont have any goddamn vents
[20:56] JaKWaC: Turned out I had some random Ruby process in a crazy loop consuming like 80% of my cpu
[20:56] brianc: jamescarr: basically once your function & it's callstack return
[20:57] smathy: DrMcKay… point is that they intentionally use the aluminium case as a heat sink.
[20:57] JaKWaC: It had been running for days.
[20:57] gkatsev: JaKWaC: there's your problem. You were using ruby.
[20:57] DrMcKay: smathy: I actually like that idea
[20:57] perezd has joined the channel
[20:57] smathy: DrMcKay… me too, I love my MBP.
[20:57] smathy: DrMcKay… just that when I want to actually put it on my lap, I bring some insulation.
[20:58] DrMcKay: lol
[20:58] DrMcKay: I'll make sure to carry something with me
[20:58] DrMcKay: oh, but wait
[20:58] DrMcKay: it means that I can't use it in bed?
[20:58] smathy: DrMcKay… sitting cross-legged, so that only the edges of my 17" MBP touch my legs is workable.
[20:58] PastorBones has joined the channel
[20:58] brianc: jamescarr: think of the event loop like a list of queue data structures of instructions for node to execute. when you do process.nextTick it gets pushed into the beginning of the next queue
[20:58] smathy: DrMcKay… I use a Stable Table™ in bed.
[20:58] brianc: jamescarr: i dunno if that makes sense
[20:59] JaKWaC: smathy: Do you carry your 17" MBP around lot? I'm looking at buying a personal MBP but not sure what I want. I currently work on 13"
[20:59] DrMcKay: smathy: I'll check it out, thanks
[20:59] TomY has joined the channel
[20:59] smathy: DrMcKay… the fans aren't positioned well for a soft surface either, so in bed with it on your lap - your lap heats up, on the covers, the fan is blocked and makes things heat up even quicker.
[20:59] jamescarr: brianc, it doesn't. I get the event loop, but I always have trouble describing it adequately
[20:59] arkx has joined the channel

[21:00] jamescarr: I mean, calling process.nextTick with a bunch of functions doesn't really mean you'll run the code in parallel, right?
[21:00] smathy: JaKWaC… I bring it to/from work every day (but I drive) and take it to our offices in TJ on a regular basis (again, driving).  It's too big for an airplane.

[21:00] shanez has left the channel
[21:01] smathy: (at work I have a cinema)
[21:01] brianc: jamescarr: no, it's not parallel it's just "later."  Like "hey, do this as soon as you are bored, but not right this second" and node has ADHD so it gets bored as soon as you stop telling it what to do and checks its list of things you asked it to do as soon as it got bored
[21:01] kimico has joined the channel
[21:01] stagas has joined the channel
[21:01] smathy: "node has ADHD" :)
[21:01] JaKWaC: Ya, I only do coding, so resolution isn't that big of a deal for me.
[21:02] josdehar has joined the channel
[21:02] smathy: JaKWaC… I only do coding, so resolution is really important to me :)
[21:02] brianc: jamescarr: and once it gets bored and has nothing to do it just sits around waiting for I/O to complete. and if there's no pending I/O (which is also in its 'do this when you're bored' list) it gets REALLY bored. so bored it dies.

[21:03] sneakyness_wk has joined the channel
[21:04] smathy: JaKWaC… I just mean that when I look at what I do on a 15, I miss that extra space for laying out my editor, web, and console.
[21:04] smathy: JaKWaC… and the 17 is only slightly heavier than the 15, and only slightly bigger (the 15 is really a 15.4).
[21:05] DrMcKay: I'm used to 11.6", 13" should be OK for me
[21:05] JaKWaC: I went to dropbox the other month and everyone there is on a 13 Air with 30 inch externals lol
[21:05] smathy: Yeah, I wish I could love that 13, or the Air.
[21:05] smathy: I can't do the air, can't live without my 8GB of RAM.
[21:06] Aikar: i cant work with less than 19-20~"
[21:06] Aikar: dual 23" at home is ideal

[21:20] Barakhyahu has joined the channel
[21:20] Aikar: DrMcKay: git-svn isnt a perfect workflow replacement. theres a bit to learn, pitfalls to learn, understanding how to bridge the a git workflow into an svn workflow, then theres the issue of typical git-svn dev with local git branches not commiting work to actual svn branches
[21:20] PastorBones: is there another way to get ubuntu onto vb?
[21:20] brianc: PastorBones: don't import that. just download the ubunut iso 
[21:20] halcyon918 has left the channel

[21:21] brianc: talk about a redundant url
[21:21] JaKWaC: lol
[21:21] PastorBones: lol
[21:21] Aikar: having a perfect git-svn workflow to replace an svn workflow is research and experience on its own outside of git and svn both
[21:21] DrMcKay: Aikar: that's the good thing, I think
[21:21] Aikar: DrMcKay: not when it comes to working as a team...
[21:21] Aikar: if one person works 1 story only, sure
[21:21] Barakhyahu has joined the channel
[21:22] DrMcKay: Aikar: can't you simply push those branches?
[21:22] Aikar: and that was my point, trying to get git-svn to push to a branch, and then merge it back in, its very easy to blow up your working copy

[21:22] Aikar: you cant use a simple git-merge

[21:23] smathy: First thing I did here was move them from svn to git.
[21:23] brianc: smathy: I moved my company from visual source-safe to mercurial

[21:26] Aikar: smathy: as i said above, our downtime comes from our developer environment integrations. all the internal tools, configurations, and such that issue svn commands
[21:26] smathy: Aikar… I started first, with github - still pushing to the old repo with git-svn, and then moved each developer one at a time, then once they were all over, switched off the svn.

[22:18] brianc: gzmask: I did this in a non-open source addon recently.  best thing is read the waf documentation (though node uses an older version of waf, so read the older documentation) and build with verbose: node-waf configure build -vvv so you can see the g++ commands
[22:18] TheJH: diamonds, sounds doable. require('http').createServer(function(req,res){if(req.method=='POST'){... consume the incoming data... require('child_process').spawn('firefox.exe', ['-new-tab', url])};res.writeHead(200);res.end()}).listen(1234)

[23:06] halcyon918: DrMcKay: I was trying to use that lib and noticed it's in coffeescript... well, when I try to inspect the object I get back:  function() { [native code] }
[23:07] halcyon918: the callback shows the node fine, and it returns a "Node" object (coffeescript) but I can't seem to figure out how to extract my data from it
[23:08] DrMcKay: halcyon918: are you sure it's that's more like coffeescript problem
[23:08] halcyon918: I don't really get the callback w/ return object though... the callback has the node's JSON as a string, which is ok... but the object I can't seem to introspect
[23:08] halcyon918: DrMcKay: hah... I don't know what the problem is
[23:09] shipit has joined the channel
[23:09] DrMcKay: to be more precise, coffeescript is a problem ;)
[23:09] hornairs: tjholowaychuk: i'm @harrybrundage
[23:09] halcyon918: so some more context, I'm simply trying to use express to query Neo4j, then return the JSON...
[23:10] netlemur has joined the channel
[23:10] halcyon918: so in my express function, I call the Neo4j lib and that calls my callback... but by that time I'm out of the express context, so I can't seem to get the Node's JSON back to the requestor
[23:11] halcyon918: the source of the Node object says it has a "toString" but even that doesn't seem to work as it's declared in the source... I should get "Node #<number>" but I don't get that... I'm just kinda baffled
[23:12] halcyon918: I'm prepared just make REST calls against Neo4j myself... I just wanna be lazy :P
