[00:13] perezd: 76

[00:14] perezd: could be him being dumb
[00:15] mscdex_: it is a recent commit on that cocoa-websocket, so it could be possible
[00:15] mscdex_: i know a lot of people use socket.io all the time with draft 76 clients
[00:15] mscdex_: like chrome
[00:17] perezd: ugh

[02:00] marcello3d: ACTION is adding more unit tests to mongolian deadbeef (woo hoo!)
[02:00] JimBastard: im still under the impression that npm is suitable for doing application deployments
[02:00] marcello3d: but boy do I sure hate writing unit tests :D
[02:00] ryah_: mine is a bit more than a deployment too
[02:00] JimBastard: id rather see npm pimped out more then a new tool, but shit, please prove me wrong
[02:00] tim_smart: ryah_: Basicially I envisioned something that sits on top of npm, that adds a basic way of writing scripts that runs commands locally and remotely.
[02:01] pquerna: ryah_: is it possible to get more generic doc version links?
[02:02] pquerna: ryah_: like http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4/ is a symlink to the most recent v0.4 version?
[02:02] ryah_: pquerna: sigh
[02:02] pquerna: sorry if this was covered before somewhere
[02:02] ryah_: it's possible but it requires me to update symlinks everytime
[02:02] ryah_: i guess i could come up with a better deploy script...
[02:02] marcello3d: maybe you should write some ajax
[02:03] marcello3d: that loads http://nodejs.org/docs/
[02:03] tim_smart: JimBastard: I'm not sure we would want to see deployment specific stuff sitting in npm code
[02:03] marcello3d: finds the last link

[02:25] marcello3d: just used to indicate private
[02:26] Booths: how would one actually restrict use, besides declaring it inside the actual initialization
[02:26] kkaefer: Booths: it's a convention; there is no mechanic to prevent you from calling them
[02:27] marcello3d: Booths: you could declare it in an isolated scope

[03:02] marcello3d: and when you have multiple threads, you're trying to stuff lots of things into the tubes at once
[03:02] marcello3d: and they all get stuck
[03:03] marcello3d: with node.js you have one tube
[03:03] marcello3d: and everything is pushed into the tube and comes out the other end one at a time
[03:03] seivan: I am waiting for a but
[03:03] seivan: OH
[03:03] seivan: queueing
[03:03] seivan: just like GCD
[03:03] marcello3d: basically
[03:03] marcello3d: so whenever you do an async callback
[03:03] seivan: That's how GCD works, "basically"
[03:03] seivan: It queues it for a worker

[03:03] seivan: Got it
[03:04] Yuffster has joined the channel
[03:04] marcello3d: whatever does the work does it
[03:04] Silks: If I have to periodically poll an external API to grab data, and I wish to push that data through AJAX+Node.js, should I use Node.js to run the scheduling or something else to gather the information to pass along to the user?
[03:04] jsilver: whoa
[03:04] jsilver: js2cs can compile jquery now
[03:04] jsilver: lul
[03:04] seivan: marcello3d: except, in GCD you gotta think of what "queue" you are in
[03:04] seivan: marcello3d: Some stuff need to be in the main "queue" (thread)
[03:04] marcello3d: yes
[03:04] marcello3d: there's only one queue on node.js
[03:05] saschagehlich has joined the channel
[03:05] seivan: Ah got ya
[03:05] seivan: Isn't that bad?
[03:05] marcello3d: to make more you need to use extensions (like web workers)
[03:05] marcello3d: or run multiple instances of node.js
[03:05] seivan: got it.
[03:05] marcello3d: and communicate using whatever mechanism you prefer
[03:05] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[03:05] Aria: You can also nextTick to buffer things for one iteration
[03:05] pquerna: +  if (options.secureProtocol) this.secureProtocol = options.secureProtocol;
[03:05] pquerna:  	799	
[03:05] pquerna: +  if (options.secureOptions) this.secureOptions = options.secureOptions;
[03:05] pquerna: shouldn't that be s/secure//
[03:06] postwait: nope, don't think so.
[03:06] postwait: secureProtocol and secureOptions are the keys passed into credentials
[03:06] postwait: just need to propagate them forward.
[03:07] marcello3d: seivan: it's only bad if you're doing lots of CPU 
[03:07] Croms has joined the channel
[03:07] Silks: does anyone have any ideas for my above question? would really appreciate the insight
[03:07] marcello3d: in the sense that you will freeze the queue if you don't use some kind of multi-node worker system

[03:11] saschagehlich: mornin'! is there a way to get better stack traces on exceptions in low level node.js files? like net.js/http.js?
[03:11] Aria: What's the question, Silks?
[03:11] postwait: pquerna: I can now do this: creds.secureOptions = constants.SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2; https.createServer(creds);
[03:11] Silks: Aria, If I have to periodically poll an external API to grab data, and I wish to push that data through AJAX+Node.js, should I use Node.js to run the scheduling or something else to gather the information to pass along to the user?
[03:12] Aria: node is perfectly capable.
[03:12] pquerna: right, just more a suggestion that the fields on the creds object should be s/secure//
[03:12] pquerna: just creds.options or creds.protocol
[03:12] pquerna: but NBD
[03:12] postwait: the secureProtocol one there predates me ;-)
[03:12] postwait: I was just trying to match style.
[03:12] Aria: IF your AJAX clients are polling, you might have to pass on to them how often to schedule, but the polling the API can be just a setTimeout
[03:12] pquerna: the patch is needed for a production ssl service +1
[03:12] pquerna: there was a thread asking about this in on the user list too
[03:13] pquerna: you can't set ciphers currently either
[03:13] postwait: yeah.. we just deployed the patched version... much fewer complains ;-)
[03:13] postwait: ciphers sounds even easier to add.
[03:13] postwait: As those set as C strings, not constants.
[03:13] postwait: I think.
[03:14] pquerna: yea, node just used the string based api before
[03:14] pquerna: with all the !NULL bullcrap
[03:14] pquerna: ('no really, I wanted a null cipher')
[03:14] Silks: Well, my plan was to implement two "rates" for the scheduler to grab the external data. Say, every 30 minutes when the user is logged off and once a minute when the user is logged on (just an example). Then, when the user is logged on those one minute updates are pushed through Node.js to the end-user with AJAX

[03:15] Aria: Sounds sane.
[03:15] Aria: "push" can be dicey depending on the ajax client, but totally doable.
[03:15] postwait: pquerna: any reason not to add a SecureContext method for: int SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list(SSL_CTX *,const char *str);
[03:15] postwait: and glue it into the credentials passing?
[03:16] pquerna: ecureContext::SetCiphers
[03:16] pquerna: its already there
[03:16] postwait: Oh.
[03:16] postwait: indeed it is.
[03:16] pquerna: it just had the creds not getting passed in problems
[03:16] cloudhead has joined the channel
[03:16] postwait: creds.ciphers

[06:51] ParadoxQuine: and javascript is somewhat like php

[06:57] ParadoxQuine: =D
[06:57] jesusabdullah: I think a good way to do it would be to combine that node library with dnode (or socket.io for those that swing that way) and a nice front-end
[06:58] ivanfi1 has joined the channel
[06:58] jesusabdullah: and, I think, you'd have to create a new irc for each person connected

[07:44] jeffmoss: in that example, i is a reference so it always puts them all at the end of the list
[07:44] ckknight_: use list.push(obj)
[07:44] V1: mAritz: Polling transports might close / destory the connection before you where able to access the client.request object
[07:44] ckknight_: :P

[07:45] seivan_ has joined the channel
[07:45] jeffmoss: am I even going about this the right way?
[07:45] jeffmoss: never done much async programming

[07:45] Polysics: V1: i do use npm
[07:45] jeffmoss: mysql
[07:45] V1: Polysics: But an easier way would just be, cloning the socket.io-node project, edit the transports with a "type" property.. So you can do.. client.type to get the transport
[07:46] ckknight_: jeffmoss: can I see your surrounding code?
[07:46] Polysics: V1: i do not feel confident enugh in node to go hack the library :-)

[07:49] jeffmoss: plus the indexof is looping, and anything else I come up with is looping, is it psosible to use a reference here?
[07:50] shaunau: when i login and then click back button and relogin i get an error about not being able to set immutable headers
[07:50] shaunau: not sure how i should handle this, can anyone offer some advise

[07:54] jeffmoss: this is a legacy dataset
[07:54] ckknight_: what is the ORM library?
[07:54] jeffmoss: just something I wrote, uses the libmysql native async stuff
[07:54] shaunau: hmm actually, ignore that it's not what i thought it was
[07:55] ckknight_: jeffmoss: so when does it call the callback?
[07:55] ajsie: with node.js i can stream data to the client .. but when do i want to use node.js to stream data through HTTP and when do i want to use sockets.io do stream?
[07:56] jeffmoss: ckknight_: when it's done loading, like an onLoaded callback

[10:10] matyr has joined the channel
[10:12] tdmackey: there's wholesale profiling with the --prof tag when you startup node oetherwise you have to resort to something like https://github.com/bnoordhuis/node-profiler i think

[10:13] tdmackey: its been a while since i've looke
[10:13] tdmackey: d
[10:13] tisba: tdmackey: the problem is, I have to start the profiler by hand, since I'm doing some initialization work
[10:13] tisba: --prof --prof_auto works fine
[10:13] tisba: maybe I can get node-profiler to work

[13:50] tbranyen: V1: I work with two core committers, if you find a bug, report it and it will be promptly fixed
[13:50] tbranyen: Chances are the bug is in your code and not in a library used by millions of websites
[13:50] V1: tbranyen: Also the documentation of jQuery is full of bad practices
[13:50] tbranyen: Oh well as for the documentation...
[13:50] tjholowaychuk: jquery IMO isn't very nice if you take away the cross-browser compat
[13:50] tbranyen: Thats pretty much true for all libraries

[14:02] gtramont1na: tjholowaychuk: quick question, dude. Yesterday I added this conf to my app in order to make it compile my coffee scripts: app.use(express.compiler({src: __dirname+'/public', enable: ['coffeescript']}). This works, but once the scripts are compiled, they are never compiled again. So I have to delete the .js files whenever I change the .coffee. Is there a better practice?

[14:26] Booths: I've got some weird problem here and I'm not even sure where to look. I get hit w/ XML Packets from various sources, sometimes they hit me with the same packet 4-5 times, so I check an array for the packet and push it into the array before parsing it. Problem is, some unique packets are failing and saying that there's a duplicate, which doesn't really make any sense to me.
[14:27] shaunau_: interesting read about the comma in js  http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2011/04/04/the-javascript-comma-operator/
[14:28] fadeddata: tjholowaychuk: Where can I learn about app.use? Is that part of express/connect/node? Also how would I know about the ordering issue?
[14:28] tbranyen: shaunau_: yeah the comma operator is very misunderstood
[14:29] tjholowaychuk: fadeddata: it's part of connect. basically the ordering is just logical from the point of request. so the first middleware gets the request, it can choose to respond, if not the next one gets it, and so on

[14:41] bradleymeck: maritz if it is still referenced somewhere it may continue to send out events. delete will never ever destruct anything, it only removes references attached to objects (some funky stuff can happen w/ variables made through eval). So, if you want to stop sending events, use removeAllListeners (which is logical). If you merely want to let it be GC'd just remove any reference / set any variable containing it to something else (null

[16:17] mattrobenolt: I guess I'm just trying to evaluate if it's worth it for our application to be written using Connect directly, or to keep using Express. We don't need anything that I can see specifically using Express. We have 3 main entry points, and all parsing of headers and responses are done by our app.
[16:18] mattrobenolt: And pretty much the only middleware we use is the cookie middleware.
[16:18] tjholowaychuk: gotcha, in that case maybe not, but not like express adds extra overhead
[16:19] tjholowaychuk: if I were to use the router at all I would use express
[16:19] mattrobenolt: I guess that's what I was getting at as well. How much of a performance hit comes with Express added on top. Or even Connect vs a raw http connection.
[16:19] tjholowaychuk: connect vs raw is the difference, express adds no overhead
[16:19] tjholowaychuk: simply extends things

[17:27] pt_tr: Sweet, thanks
[17:28] tbranyen: jquery parsejson just runs the json through a regex and then new Function's it

[17:28] pquerna: tbranyen: ah
[17:28] pquerna: so yes, a million times safer :)
[17:28] tbranyen: yeah crockfords just evals at the end of its test
[17:28] akashiraffee: req.headers['user-agent'] -> nope, this is undefined:

[17:28] akashiraffee: 		console.log(e+": "+req.headers['e']);
[17:28] akashiraffee: 	}   
[17:29] akashiraffee: yields "host: undefined" "user-agent: undefined", etc.
[17:29] tbranyen: akashiraffee: uhhh thats because you're check for the key e in headers
[17:29] pquerna: remove the quotes around 'e'
[17:29] tbranyen: like literally the letter e
[17:29] tbranyen: also don't use + with console.log

[18:18] tjholowaychuk: lukegalea: or you can do master.on('closing', function(){}) and close the connections
[18:18] lukegalea: so.. server.js is the worker?

[18:20] lukegalea: tjholowaychuk: hrm.. so server.js would initialize mongoose.. and you would pass the mongoose var into app somehow?
[18:20] tjholowaychuk: thiessenp: was just a quick hour-ish thing, got sick of looking up urls
[18:20] ji0n has joined the channel
[18:20] bingomanatee: thiessnip: yes, mine: http://www.wonderlandlabs.com/wll_drupal/node/mongoose/index.html
[18:20] fmarceau: but from what I can see... it's always using the same variables (i.e. Browser.doc)
[18:21] tjholowaychuk: lukegalea: just have server.js or w/e export the app, all your connections are fine in there, that file is not executed in anything but the workers
[18:21] jetienne has joined the channel
[18:21] tjholowaychuk: lukegalea: app.js (or whatever you call cluster() in) is executed in both the worker(s) / master
[18:21] thiessenp: bingomanatee: merci buckets - reading now
[18:22] Ezku\: bingomanatee: oh thank god for that link
[18:22] lukegalea: tjholowaychuk: oh.. okay.. so if I follow your docs and have a server.js with the cluster call in it and an app.js.. server.js will only get called once, but app.js will get called for every worker process?
[18:22] bingomanatee: Let me know if you have any other questions and I'll expand - I am talking to a core contributor to mongoose tonight at the Node meetup.
[18:22] Ezku\: I was so lost with mongoose, reading the manual pages over and over again in case I missed some tidbit

[18:22] ZeroCoder has joined the channel
[18:22] lukegalea: aah. perfect. Thanks!
[18:23] tjholowaychuk: lukegalea: it's just confusing when you use the same file, because it plays two different roles, which is fine for simple apps but not for others
[18:23] thiessenp: bingomanatee: wow, I definitely will
[18:23] bingomanatee: no the manual is a pretty sham excuse for docs with all due respect - they cover schema and pretty much expect people to read the API for everything else.

[18:23] mdoan has joined the channel
[18:23] Ezku\: i'm fine with reading an api, really, it just seems to be rather dense as well
[18:23] lukegalea: tjholowaychuk: Ya. I think my confusion came from the fact that the docs talk about worker processes, etc.. but don't make it clear which is which. Makes sense.
[18:24] tjholowaychuk: lukegalea: well the workers are the ones doing the work, the master process doesn't actually even need the server instance
[18:24] tjholowaychuk: it's not used

[18:28] tjholowaychuk: lukegalea: haha yeah man, np
[18:28] tjholowaychuk: just a little weird to use at times since its not a CLI
[18:28] tjholowaychuk: but non-CLI is way more flexible
[18:28] micheil has joined the channel
[18:29] lukegalea: tjholowaychuk: I heard through the grapevine that you had defined some kind of auto git checkout process to use with cluster.. ie: have a production tag checked out automatically on startup, etc. Is that documented anywhere?
[18:29] tjholowaychuk: lukegalea: its just a private plugin we have
[18:29] c4milo: tjholowaychuk: why private!
[18:30] tjholowaychuk: its not very robust
[18:30] tjholowaychuk: haha
[18:30] c4milo: tjholowaychuk: we need it too :P 
[18:30] tjholowaychuk: or polished, but it works
[18:30] c4milo: tjholowaychuk: we can make it robust 
[18:30] tjholowaychuk: and ih ave a mixpanel one, private as well
[18:30] tjholowaychuk: and a cluster irc bot
[18:30] Ezku\: bingomanatee: http://www.wonderlandlabs.com/wll_drupal/node/268 says mongoose.connect is blocking, which is not true
[18:30] c4milo: tjholowaychuk: nice
[18:30] bingomanatee: really? Ever try to run mongoose with mongo off?
[18:30] christophsturm: tjholowaychuk: we couldnt get cluster running on our ubuntu servers. even the test suite does not work there. we get the EINVAL error thats in this ticket: https://github.com/learnboost/cluster/issues#issue/47
[18:30] Ezku\: bingomanatee: yes, plus i've read the manual
[18:30] bingomanatee: I'll show you blocking! freezes your whole app.
[18:31] Ezku\: bingomanatee: what happens is mongoose.connect does not block, but any following queries you do will
[18:31] bingomanatee: I find the distinction a little academic.

[18:32] lukegalea: tjholowaychuk: Do you find you use the cluster REPL the way one would use script/server in a rails app? As a console for working with the app?

[18:34] tjholowaychuk: sorry there is no start
[18:34] tjholowaychuk: haha
[18:34] lukegalea: tjholowaychuk: okay.. answers my question. So if you want to have a REPL for working with DB, utilities, etc.. then you define that seperateely.
[18:34] tjholowaychuk: i lied, $ node app.js restart  etc
[18:34] lukegalea: that's cool. I was thinking of combining them.. but perhaps not best.
[18:34] tjholowaychuk: lukegalea: yeah, cluster.repl.define('function
[18:34] tjholowaychuk: yeah, might not be an easy way to do that, although the context object could be altered
[18:34] tjholowaychuk: not sure I expose that right now, i dont think so
[18:34] lukegalea: yeah... my current pre-cluster config uses node's REPL directly and defines a whole bunch of stuff in the context object.
[18:35] tjholowaychuk: christophsturm: yeah sorry :( not sure exactly whats going on there
[18:35] tjholowaychuk: been to busy to take the time to discover why ubuntu hates me
[18:35] christophsturm: tjholowaychuk: i just commented on the issue, i think the file descriptor is not valid
[18:35] tjholowaychuk: lukegalea: yeah, if I dont expose it we should open an issue and expose it

Once I get a basic hello world going, I'll be rolling :-)

[19:06] Buttons840: does node.js aim to be generally useful (outside of web development)?
[19:06] konobi: yes
[19:06] bradleymeck: i dont use it for web almost at all
[19:06] tjholowaychuk: Buttons840: if anything its less about that, and more about networking

[19:10] Buttons840: my knowledge of js is limited and dated; does js have classes/instances/methods and all that other standard OO stuff?
[19:11] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: i feel like learnboost has technology thats way too cool for what it is
[19:11] bradleymeck: buttons840 it is not class based OO it is prototypical
[19:11] wink_: Buttons840: yes, you'll definitely want to bone up though
[19:11] tjholowaychuk: bradleymeck: just prefer to use things that are easy to contribute back to later

[19:38] baudehlo: bradleymeck: yep no worries. It should nicely deal with attachments too fwiw.
[19:39] baudehlo: you just do: connection.transaction.attachment_hooks(start_cb, data_cb)
[19:39] bradleymeck: yea, i might have some time in next couple of weeks to test it out programatically rather than straight up as a daemon if i can figure it out

[21:46] yozgrahame has joined the channel
[21:46] tjholowaychuk: the overhead of the view system for html, woudl be retarded lol
[21:46] tjholowaychuk: just serve the file
[21:47] brianc has joined the channel
[21:47] gzmask: tjholowaychuk: so that jade should be use if I want to serve html?
[21:47] tjholowaychuk: gzmask: or ejs, or haml, anything you want
[21:48] tjholowaychuk: if it has a variable output, then you need a template engine
[21:48] brianc: tjholowaychuk: any recommendation on a good template engine for use in the browser?
[21:48] gzmask: tjholowaychuk: i see... any preference for those template engines?
[21:48] tjholowaychuk: brianc: for browser stuff I usually just use jade or a little mustache-ish thing I have laying around
[21:49] tjholowaychuk: gzmask: IMO jade
[21:49] KieranYo has joined the channel
[21:49] brianc: tjholowaychuk: didn't know jade worked in browser. so hot.

[21:49] sveimac has joined the channel
[21:49] tjholowaychuk: brianc: kinda, its a little broken since there are a few things still not exactly cross-browser friendly, but you can peek at the compiler, it's at support/compile.js I think
[21:50] stagas: tjholowaychuk: to declare locals to be used everywhere is it app.set('locals', {}) ?
[21:50] tjholowaychuk: stagas: many ways to do that, app.locals({ foo: 'bar' }) for example
[21:50] tjholowaychuk: is probably what you want there
[21:51] tjholowaychuk: each call gets merged
[21:52] kriszyp has joined the channel
[21:53] KieranYo: Hi
[21:53] stagas: tjholowaychuk: merged? basically I want to declare some vars undefined so that if (blah) doesn't break unless I pass it in res.render locals
[21:53] KieranYo: I can't seem to get openssl onto my Mac OS 10.5.6
[21:53] KieranYo: Checking for openssl                     : not found  
[21:53] bcelenza has joined the channel
[21:53] tjholowaychuk: stagas: undefined will break
[21:54] tjholowaychuk: stagas: with(){} doesnt help that
[21:54] tjholowaychuk: js is not very template engine friendly
[21:54] EyePulp: so is there a simple library to chain together a series of async functions cleanly?  I found creationx's Step, which might be enough, but was curious about other options
[21:55] stagas: v8: var foo = { bar: undefined }; with(foo) { bar ? true : false }
[21:55] v8bot: stagas: false
[21:55] tjholowaychuk: stagas: hmm that threw for me in the repl
[21:56] tjholowaychuk: stagas: nvm, you are right, just the repl was messed for some reason
[21:56] stagas: tjholowaychuk: so it's possible! :)
[21:56] tjholowaychuk: stagas: cool. would be nice if we could magically figure out all the vars used and default them
[21:56] tjholowaychuk: learn new things about js every day haha
[21:57] tjholowaychuk: with() is fucked
[21:57] stagas: tjholowaychuk: I don't mind passing in an array of variable names
[21:57] tjholowaychuk: the fact that you can do bar = 'rawr' in there is just wrong
[21:57] zcopley has joined the channel
[21:57] tjholowaychuk: stagas: I bet with proxies it could work for anything
[21:57] tjholowaychuk: maybe
[21:57] tjholowaychuk: but meh
[21:59] mattrobenolt: Hey tjholowaychuk, with Express, is there a nice way to do a raw regex pattern in a request path?
[21:59] tjholowaychuk: mattrobenolt: app.get(/whatever/, fn)
[21:59] mattrobenolt: Instead of doing:  app.get('/something/:id' ..')
[21:59] mattrobenolt: Ahh, that's nice. :)
[21:59] tjholowaychuk: mattrobenolt: yeah just pass a regexp, the capture groups are req.params (array)
[21:59] stagas: tjholowaychuk: but you said with app.locals() they are merged in so will they lose the undefined on the next view? it's confusing
[22:00] mattrobenolt: Yep, was just going to ask about the capture groups then. :)
[22:00] tjholowaychuk: stagas: nope, do app.locals() out of a route
[22:00] Martz^ has joined the channel
[22:00] tjholowaychuk: stagas: they will always be applied
[22:00] tjholowaychuk: stagas: or res.locals({}), res.local(key, val), etc

[22:03] stagas: tjholowaychuk: it worked!

[22:03] tjholowaychuk: haha
[22:03] tjholowaychuk:  </overkill>
[22:03] stagas: tjholowaychuk: no it didn't. it's replaced haha
[22:04] tjholowaychuk: stagas: hmm, it should work, I dont think I do any undefined === checks

[22:24] brianc: well it looks like it has libev inside it, so doubt it's going to replace libev
[22:24] ryah_: brianc: both
[22:24] tjholowaychuk: brianc: probably another layer of abstraction
[22:24] tjholowaychuk: for windows support i dunno
[22:25] brianc: ryah_: sweet
[22:25] tjholowaychuk: ryah_: is windows the main reason? or is there something about libev/io?
[22:25] balaa has joined the channel
[22:26] brianc: tjholowaychuk: Yah I think they been tryin' to make the same API for async socket, fs, tty, and domain socket (named pipes) across all OSs
[22:26] ryah_: tjholowaychuk: windows, yes
[22:26] tjholowaychuk: k cool
[22:26] ryah_: layer above libev/eio since those don't work as well on windows
[22:27] baudehlo: next step node support in Visual Studio?
[22:27] ryah_: eventually. obviously the massive engineering effort is the first thing to overcome before worrying about build systems
[22:28] brianc: next step node works on windows!
[22:28] baudehlo: ACTION couldn't care less about windows support
[22:28] llkazu: +1 baudehlo

[22:28] jeffmoss has left the channel
[22:29] brianc: yeah, i was thinking how enabling it will be for new coders on windows to come to node, download 1 .exe and write some javascript, type "node.exe myserver.js" and have a full blown web server and app framework

[22:44] baudehlo: bradleymeck: yeah I don't think that's the problem - I think it's just PEBCAK.
[22:44] bradleymeck: plus IDE integration w/ JS is terrible pretty much everywhere
[22:44] tjholowaychuk: who needs an IDE for js period
[22:44] bingomanatee_: I like Komodo - it has good JS introspection, formatting, just all around nice. 
[22:44] qbert_: tjholowaychuk, use WebStorm and refactor a bunch of JS and come back and say that
[22:44] bingomanatee_: I wouldn't say I require it - do plenty of naked text editing - but its convenient. 
[22:44] tjholowaychuk: pff
[22:44] qbert_:  /eyeroll
[22:45] bradleymeck: refactoring or renaming?
[22:45] qbert_: refactoring, including the HTML you may or may not call it in
[22:45] tjholowaychuk: i dont find that hard as-is
[22:45] tjholowaychuk: so meh
[22:45] bingomanatee_: JS, Node !== Java/PHP - you won't find intrpspection, refctoring or renaming assistance from your IDE

[23:41] mscdex: ncurses is character based, not pixel based, so you'd have to have a pretty small scale to get good precision
[23:41] JimBastard: any idea on the refresh rates you can get?
[23:41] techwraith: Mikeal: Looks like Louisiana Fried Chicken and Garlic Mash tonight :)
[23:41] mscdex: i'd imagine pretty decent
[23:41] JimBastard: will it flicker?
[23:41] mscdex: mape was going some realtime refreshing stuff awhile back
[23:41] mikeal: techwraith: fuck you man :)
[23:42] JimBastard: with ncurses?
[23:42] mscdex: *doing
[23:42] rfay_afk has joined the channel
[23:42] mscdex: yeah
[23:42] JimBastard: cool
[23:42] sorens3n: aha
[23:42] sorens3n: thanks for testing
[23:42] mikeal: if i wasn't lazy i woul djust ride by bike to the office :)
[23:42] mikeal: techwraith: is it from marlowe again?
[23:42] sam0t has joined the channel
[23:42] mikeal: or somewhere else
[23:42] mscdex: JimBastard: with ncurses you can manipulate a virtual layer and then update to the physical screen
[23:42] sorens3n: techwraith / rubicon
[23:42] techwraith: I think so
[23:43] mscdex: JimBastard: doing that is much more efficient

[23:43] rubicon: hey srry i was afk
[23:43] sorens3n: same, got a phone call as soon as you guys went lol
[23:43] rubicon: oh lol
[23:43] rubicon: dude, your site is awesome
[23:43] sorens3n: ah thanks
[23:43] rubicon: that's kinda what my goal is for learning node.js
[23:43] rubicon: ^_^
[23:43] sorens3n: this is build primarily with dnode / backbone
[23:43] linkmauve has joined the channel
[23:44] sorens3n: using pub/sub through dnode
[23:44] techwraith: sorens3n: Is there any persistance?
[23:44] no-gooder has joined the channel
[23:44] sorens3n: yes, using visionmedia/keys
[23:44] sorens3n: the redis is bugged at the moment
[23:44] rubicon: at the moment, i am too noob to know what those are
[23:44] sorens3n: but its on Memory right now
[23:45] sorens3n: keys is a key storage interface to redis/mongo/memory/nStore/riak
[23:45] tjholowaychuk: is irc-js dude in here?
[23:45] sorens3n: which provides a standard API
[23:45] sorens3n: thank tjholoway for that
[23:45] sorens3n: :)
[23:45] tjholowaychuk: sorens3n: is it? I havent touched it in a while
[23:45] sorens3n: its alllmost the same
[23:45] techwraith: lol, we have to thank tjholowaychuk for almost everything.
[23:45] tjholowaychuk: to be honest i dont use it haha i wanted to use it for a unified session store
[23:45] no-gooder:  i get an error somethin like : xhr -multipart message handle error
[23:46] no-gooder: what is it ?
[23:46] sorens3n: as in, memory returns a buffer, redis doesnt
[23:46] techwraith: (well, for most the modules that I use anyways) :)
[23:46] sorens3n: ah i really like it man, makes it very clean
[23:46] sorens3n: thanks much
[23:46] sorens3n: http://darkteal.org:3000/
[23:46] sorens3n: is running on Keys
[23:46] sorens3n: and express too of course ;)
[23:47] mscdex: tjholowaychuk: gf3 pops in occasionally
[23:47] tjholowaychuk: haha sweet :D
[23:47] tjholowaychuk: mscdex: ah thanks
[23:47] tjholowaychuk: wondering how to disable the logging
[23:47] tjholowaychuk: if possible (hope so)
[23:47] mscdex: out of curiousity, what problem were running into with node-irc?

[23:48] Charuru: tjholowaychuk: just curious and hope you don't mind me asking, but why did learnboost decide to invest so heavily into node?
[23:48] Kholoa has joined the channel
[23:48] tjholowaychuk: just weird api design
[23:48] Charuru: just for funsies?
[23:48] tjholowaychuk: and logging that is enabled by default haha
[23:48] [[zzz]] has joined the channel
[23:48] tjholowaychuk: Charuru: I wasn't around at the beginning so im not 100% sure, but we have a lot of realtime stuff planned
[23:48] tjholowaychuk: so that was obviously most of the motiviation
[23:49] tjholowaychuk: plus hiring js devs that can work on the server / client no problem is great
[23:49] Charuru: ahh ok, cool, yeah me too :)
[23:50] Charuru: that answer was rather more normal than i had thought it might be, i dunno why but i expected something more arcane lol
[23:50] binarypie has joined the channel
[23:51] deedubs: tjholowaychuk: I'm trying to use cluster with capistrano for deploy and the reload plugin seems to disagree with running from a symlinked dir.  Does that seem possible?
[23:51] binarypie has joined the channel
[23:52] tjholowaychuk: deedubs: possibly yeah, not sure how the watchers react to symlinks, I would use reload() for dev though, not production
[23:52] MikhX has joined the channel
[23:52] deedubs: ah okay
[23:52] tjholowaychuk: cluster restarts on its own, reload() is just mainly for development with a hard restart
[23:52] tjholowaychuk: so you dont have to wait
[23:52] tjholowaychuk: for connections to close
[23:52] deedubs: 'cluster restarts on its own'?
[23:53] tjholowaychuk: without the reload() plugin you can still restart
[23:53] tjholowaychuk: SIGUSR2
[23:53] deedubs: yeah
[23:53] tjholowaychuk: or the repl / cli
[23:53] secoif has joined the channel
[23:54] deedubs: I think that running from a symlink'd dir messes up as well
[23:54] graysky has joined the channel
[23:54] deedubs: havent tested extensively, just using upstart commands for now
[23:54] tjholowaychuk: hmm, let me know if you have any debug output that I can see if you get a stack
[23:54] graysky has left the channel
[23:54] deedubs: for sure
[23:56] deedubs: luckily the app restarts very very fast atm
[23:57] tjholowaychuk: ours is huge and its not very bad

[23:58] EyePulp: if I require a module twice, aren't I creating two separate instances of whatever it returns each time?
[23:59] EyePulp: modules are limited to their own scope, except for what they export, no?
