[00:58] Brandon_R: there is something that v8 does that makes it easier to ddos

[00:59] Brandon_R: oh
[00:59] Brandon_R: so it's not something an average user should worry about?
[01:00] CoverSlide: well the querystring module does that, which is kind of the de-facto standard
[01:00] CoverSlide: for node at least
[01:00] CoverSlide: and i think express uses it as well
[01:01] CoverSlide: apparently they're patching v8 to circumvent the issue
[01:01] Brandon_R: is learnboost.com aware?
[01:01] Brandon_R: it uses that
[01:01] CoverSlide: there are other methods

[02:36] Zyclops: hey
[02:37] Zyclops: ok i've never done asyncronous style code without threads before.. and i'm having a hard time wrapping my head around it
[02:37] Zyclops: it seems to make my functions 5 times as big
[02:37] Zyclops: is there anyway to go.. hey run all this code procedurally
[02:37] Zyclops: (the code needs to be procedural within this function)
[02:39] maxogden: Zyclops: make 5 small functions
[02:40] Zyclops: https://gist.github.com/05ea4f932e415196202d << so i've got this code.. this.getDeck is asyncronous.. what should i be doing
[02:41] maxogden: Zyclops: you can pass anonymous functions in as arguments (also known as callbacks)
[02:41] Zyclops: at step e (line 4) i need to run another function that relies on calculateAndSetBonusTime being completed
[02:41] maxogden: or named functions
[02:42] mikeal: you aren't passing callbacks to these functions
[02:42] mikeal: so whoever the caller is doesn't know when they finish
[02:42] Zyclops: ok so my unit test calls
[02:42] Zyclops: reviewNotDue.again();
[02:42] Zyclops: 			expect(reviewNotDue.get('bonus_time')).toEqual(0);
[02:42] maxogden: mikeal: :D
[02:42] Zyclops: what your saying is that i need to go something like reviewNotDue.again(some_callback_function)

[02:43] Zyclops: some_callback_function = function() { expect(reviewNotDue.get('bonus_time')â€¦. }
[02:43] mikeal: then you can decide how many sequential callbacks you do before you resolve it
[02:44] mikeal: and make sure you follow the standard node callback pattern or else you'll hate yourself later

[02:45] VICODAN2: ok
[02:45] VICODAN2: you think you could help some other time?
[02:46] maxogden: VICODAN2: if your thing is cool it will gain attention through npm/github/twitter

[02:46] VICODAN2: maxogden: it is cool. it's just not 100% working yet
[02:46] maxogden: mikeal: oh dude how is the sous vide
[02:46] Zyclops: ok at the moment i'm writing client side codeâ€¦ should I still follow that pattern?
[02:46] mikeal: sous vide!
[02:46] VICODAN2: it's not even my code. it's dreamdust's code.
[02:46] mikeal: maxogden: i'm making everything sous vide

[02:46] maxogden: mikeal: i have some jasonsmith halibut in my freezer
[02:46] mikeal: aaron is coming over for NYE and we're going crazy overboard making "white trash" themed food
[02:47] Zyclops: ahh i came in here yesterday.. and asked whether i should be using node.js for a large "this is the entire business" program.. and the recommendation i got was no
[02:47] Zyclops: because node.js is not stable enough yet
[02:47] maxogden: "white trash" == deep fryer
[02:47] mikeal: i'm gonna sous vide hamburgers :)
[02:47] Zyclops: even though it would allow us to use a single language.. is that your guys opinion as well?

[02:47] maxogden: Zyclops: https://twitter.com/#!/mranney/status/145778414165569536
[02:48] mikeal: Zyclops: depends on your app
[02:48] mikeal: what does your app do?
[02:48] zomg: If real money depends on the success of your project I wouldn't just rush towards node right away
[02:48] VICODAN2: guess not
[02:48] zomg: Although it is proven to be capable of running real production systems, I would still investigate alternatives
[02:48] Zyclops: syncronises stuff between lots of devices
[02:48] zomg: and finally, have a backup plan
[02:49] maxogden: ACTION issues blanket statements in response to broad questions about a specific technology
[02:49] zomg: As with any tech, don't just use it cause it's cool or hip or whatever
[02:49] zomg: imo Before you choose to use node you should know its strengths and weaknesses
[02:49] Zyclops: about 1% of that will be real time (i.e. as fast as possible), the rest is batchâ€¦ does a whole lot of syncing and merging stuff on the server side. persists stuff to a document db
[02:49] Zyclops: oh yeah.. we need to go with a fairly safe option.. but the entire client side is written in js / html5
[02:50] mikeal: Zyclops: node shines when you need to do lots of IO
[02:51] mikeal: like, one http requests causes multiple calls to multiple databases
[02:51] mikeal: and maybe sends some push notificaitons or something
[02:51] Zyclops: right.. thats pretty much all this system does.. is shift information between multiple devices
[02:51] mikeal: yeah, node is good at that
[02:51] Zyclops: and act as a storage engine.. but the thing is
[02:51] mikeal: in fact, it's so good at that it's probably worth dealing with whatever node might be bad at
[02:51] Zyclops: we are intending to have 100's of thousands of users
[02:51] mikeal: use CouchDB for storage
[02:51] Zyclops: I was thinking of using amazon simpledb
[02:51] mikeal: yeah, voxer has over a million users on node
[02:52] zomg: you could probably have a million users on MUMPS but it would still not make it any good
[02:52] zomg: =)
[02:52] Zyclops: don't have to manage servers.. can just pay amazon more money :)
[02:53] Zyclops: also they're opening datacenters in australia and china.. where most of users are going to be
[02:53] mikeal: i don't have a super high opinion of simpledb

[02:53] Zyclops: we've just been writing the client side app

[02:53] Zyclops: so we're still open 
[02:53] mikeal: if you hit a ceiling, rahter
[02:53] Zyclops: maxogden: why :)
[02:54] mikeal: maxogden: HAHAHA
[02:54] Zyclops: i did look at haskell and erlang
[02:54] Zyclops: but the issue is all my guys know javascript and ruby
[02:54] maxogden: Zyclops: web scale etc
[02:54] Zyclops: (and some java)
[02:54] zomg: You probably want js or ruby then =)
[02:54] eviltwin_ has joined the channel
[02:55] mikeal: you need someone who is good at node.js
[02:55] mikeal: it's different enough that you need at least someone who is really comfortable, or else things will go badly
[02:55] Zyclops: ruby would be easy.. but i was worried about what happens when we start doing lots of "live" syncing between devices
[02:55] Zyclops: which ruby isin't great at (it can't maintain open websocket connections)
[02:56] zomg: Why couldn't it do that?
[02:56] maxogden: rainbows and unicorns man
[02:56] zomg: Even PHP can do that
[02:56] zomg: =)
[02:56] Zyclops: no idea.. was chatting to guys in ruby irc.. and they said it would be a pain in the ass
[02:56] maxogden: and sunshowers
[02:56] maxogden: fiburs and eventmachine
[02:56] maxogden: lotsa options
[02:56] zomg: Well I don't know if Ruby has any websockets libs out there
[02:56] Zyclops: yeah.. i like the client side.. so easy to make choices
[02:57] zomg: but I don't see any reason why it would be any more pain in the ass than in most other languages
[02:57] populuxe: ruby and websockets has been a nightmare because of the stack. application servers and proxies that just can't hang.
[02:57] populuxe: websockets kinda breaks http, so.
[02:58] zomg: Well I'm running node behind varnish, with websockets, and it works quite fine
[02:58] zomg: I'm no ruby guy so I don't really know about that though so can't say
[02:58] populuxe: yes, I moved to node and socket.io. happiness.
[02:58] populuxe: for that one service which required it.

[03:18] RLa: i wonder how this all will play with version control
[03:19] populuxe: treat them as external to your project and you'll be a-okay.
[03:19] TheJH: RLa, http://www.mikealrogers.com/posts/nodemodules-in-git.html - always have a package.json with all dependencies, and for applications, put node_modules in git (without npm link or so)
[03:19] TheJH: populuxe, no, as the article says, deps change pretty fast, so they should be in the repo if you make an app
[03:20] TheJH: so when stuff breaks, git bisect can come to the rescue
[03:20] populuxe: hrmph.
[03:20] TheJH: populuxe, ?
[03:20] populuxe: that seems unfortunate. reading the post.
[03:21] RLa: oh, and still using svn here
[03:21] TheJH: RLa, well, you should switch :P
[03:21] isaacs: RLa: don't check in node_modules for libraries/modules that you intend to *publish* on npm, except in very rare cases.
[03:22] RLa: i have been thinking but changing whole infrastructure is too complex at the moment
[03:22] isaacs: RLa: you *should* check in node_modules of dependencies for thingst hat you you *deploy*, like a website on a server.
[03:22] skm has joined the channel
[03:22] RLa: yeah
[03:22] isaacs: RLa: that's the best rule of thumb i've found
[03:22] isaacs: RLa: npm link doesn't play the best with git
[03:22] populuxe: certainly different than in the rails ecosystem. there was a lot of work to avoid that particular requirement for repo churn.
[03:22] isaacs: RLa: you just have a symlink in your repo, not the whole source
[03:23] RLa: populuxe, same for java
[03:24] populuxe: i've actually not checked in node_modules, but have had plenty of dependency pain as a result. this advice makes sense.
[03:24] populuxe: i assume this conventional wisdom will turn at some point.

Itâ€™s not conceivable for most package maintainers to sit down and test their package will all the new updates that ship for their deps. This is why package maintainers should not version lock, and should not check in their deps.

[03:52] nathanielksmith: which seems crazy, and i feel like i must be missing something obvious

[03:56] Nabakin: sure
[03:57] windsurf_: anyone use this ORM module? https://github.com/dresende/node-orm when I load one object I can't seem to get it to load the getFoo properly
[03:57] windsurf_: I've got a Session object that hasOne 'user'
[03:58] windsurf_: getUser is returning null but I think that's because when I search for my Session.find I get an obj containing user_id = 0 (rather than 2 like it should as observed using my MySQL client, browsing the table)

[04:17] jstash has joined the channel
[04:18] aioue: zomg: any chance you can explain to me why the example on this page is not working for me? http://mongoosejs.com/docs/methods-statics.html â€¦ this.find error (non-existent function) from the first code block
[04:18] aioue: *errors
[04:18] zomg: Not sure, should work as far as I can tell
[04:18] aioue: I believe the example is wrong, but I'd like to know what the correct way to do this would be
[04:19] zomg: Are you calling it directly from the schema object?
[04:19] aioue: it works for statics but not for methods
[04:19] aioue: from an instance of the model (I think that's the correct terminology)
[04:19] aioue: exactly copied from the example
[04:19] aioue: the first 2 blocks
[04:20] aioue: obviously an alternative would be to make a static and to pass in the required type
[04:20] aioue: but I'd like to know if it's possibly to perform a find like this starting from an instance
[04:21] zomg: No idea, I've used exactly similar code and it works fine for me

[04:48] itsdman: hmm ok let me try sudo ing
[04:48] chenosaurus: sudo should do it

[11:47] SubStack: they get replaced when two approaches solve the same problem and one of them is much better
[11:47] Nuck: Like when Linux replaced every UNIX distro ever ;D
[11:47] wingie has joined the channel
[11:47] Nuck: From solaris to .*
[11:48] wingie: how could you require() different files in a npm package?
[11:48] wingie: i recall there was a way to do so before: require("mylib/file1")

[11:49] hotroot: Speaking of linux, I'm tempted to switch over to Mint Debian, but I have so much shit installed right now on Fedora =/
[11:49] Nuck: hotroot: Stick to Fedora
[11:49] Nuck: Mint sucks
[11:49] Nuck: It's slow and bloaty
[11:50] hotroot: I like Mint
[11:50] Nuck: And not as good as they try to act
[11:50] hotroot: I've used it before, the regular version
[11:50] wingie: who likes ubuntu?
[11:50] hotroot: The ubuntu core just hates this PC, it refuses to install no matter what I try, so I'm using Fedora, but tempted to use Debian

[11:53] Nuck: SubStack: Why would I use Testling instead of PhantomJS?
[11:53] Nuck: Because it's testing on more browsers?
[11:55] SubStack: Nuck: phantom is only chrome
[11:55] SubStack: well, headless webkit
[11:56] Nuck: SubStack: so the crossbrowserliness?
[11:56] SubStack: yep
[11:56] SubStack: also testling is much easier to use :p
[11:57] Nuck: IDK
[11:57] Nuck: Phantom's pretty damn easy :P

[12:09] martin_sunset: Guys, I am looking for a robust and working cookie based session store for express/connect. Is there a recommended one that people have used in production?
[12:11] hotroot: Cookie sessions? Weren't those deemed insecure like, 10 years ago?
[12:12] lingfei has joined the channel
[12:12] martin_sunset: hotroot: You encrypt them of course
[12:12] hotroot: Still, if you get the cookie you can log in as them
[12:13] hotroot: Doesn't express have regular sessions that you can just extend the time limit to? Seems safer
[12:14] stagas has joined the channel
[12:15] mara has joined the channel
[12:17] martin_sunset: hotroot: Dunno if express sessions are cookie less, if not hen the login point is moot and it just comes down to where to store she session data.
[12:18] hotroot: I suppose it cant be perfect like how TCP sockets do it
[12:18] hotroot: New to the backend web world myself, so my advice probably isn't the best actually =P
[12:19] martin_sunset: hotroot: No worries
[12:19] martin_sunset:  Guess 
[12:19] hotroot: ?

[16:22] AviMarcus has joined the channel

[16:23] aGHz: Line 20 is in the anonymous function you pass to exec_run
[16:23] ryanfitz has joined the channel

[20:55] _jzl: Hi everyone, what's the best way to connect Node.js to a LAMP stack?
[20:56] Lingerance: In what way?
[20:57] Lingerance: Add it to the stack or make it interface with the stack?
[20:57] _jzl: I need two way communication between my PHP scripts and Node.js
[20:57] _jzl: Lingerance, either
[20:57] _jzl: I could use an UNIX socket, but that seems extensive 
[20:57] Lingerance: 1) mod_proxy or put a proxy infron of Apache and node.js
[20:58] Lingerance: 2) there's nothing standard, you could use a Message Queue, or some kind of RPC system, or have a centralized process that both interact with instead of using the DB directly
[20:59] _jzl: Lingerance, hm... how do you recommend I go at making a message queue?
[20:59] russfrank: _jzl: a unix socket!
[20:59] russfrank: unix sockets aren't all that extensive
[20:59] Lingerance: ACTION doesn't use MQs
[21:00] _jzl: I presume it has to be stored somewhere both Node.js and PHP can access 
[21:00] russfrank: you could use a database
[21:00] omenar has joined the channel
[21:00] russfrank: but that's already "bigger than" a unix socket
[21:00] SubStack: http?
[21:01] _jzl: russfrank, I was thinking an mysql mem table
[21:01] _jzl: russfrank, well, is there a standard protocol for PHP <-> Node.js communication?
[21:01] Lingerance: No
[21:01] SubStack: using a database for rpc isn't usually a good idea
[21:02] SubStack: pretty sure mysql doesn't have anything like a _changes feed
[21:02] jstash has joined the channel

[21:30] orospakr: you know, like what ActiveResource does in the rails world.
[21:30] orospakr: xerox, yeah, that's what I'm about to do

[21:36] orospakr: mde, ah, cool.
[21:37] orospakr: mde, mapper/query API from what? From geddy?  Were you trying to make a REST resource connector that sat behind some of Geddy's abstractions?
[21:37] mde: When the model comes out of multiple data-sources, or API calls, trying to write a unified AR-like ORM-layer gets way, way harder.
[21:37] mde: Yes, the query-API for the Geddy model stuff. 
[21:38] mde: Geddy already does normal RESTful routes, content-negotiation, etc., on the server-side.
[21:39] orospakr: mde, oh, interesting. you're directly looking at the problem of a model system that can relate data between multiple sources at once? you've got my attention :)
[21:39] orospakr: mde, oh, you're the *author* of geddy. neat!
[21:40] mde: Yes. 
[21:40] mde: Yes, so v0.1 actually did very basic hasMany, belongsTo, find by id and type.
[21:40] mde: But it was all a hack, because the data-source was assumed to be some sort of document-store.
[21:42] jacobolus has joined the channel
[21:42] orospakr: mde, I've already written my own little resource thing on top of cradle, too.  I'm investigating yours now, though!

[22:21] Brandon_R: checking out the node.js npm registry
[22:21] Brandon_R: the github node.js wiki
[22:22] Brandon_R: what do you mean outdated?

[22:33] euoia: richardr: thanks, I'll check it out
[22:33] euoia: richardr: I wondered this as well. I'm totally comfortable writing plain HTML and am not totally convinced by jade
[22:33] Brandon_R: you get to use function
[22:33] Brandon_R: s
[22:33] Brandon_R: like loop
[22:33] Brandon_R: and auto escape
[22:34] Brandon_R: richard i'm afraid i won't be able to give you the boilerplate code
[22:34] euoia: richardr: if you like you can just use the templating features of jade

[22:36] Brandon_R: what is the fastest templating solution out there
[22:36] Brandon_R: with support for caching etcx
[22:36] richardr: mde: While separation was cool, it slowed development down a lot. Maybe just takes a bit of getting used to 
[22:37] mde: Handlebars is supposed to fix some of that, but at some point you have yet another programming language to learn.

[22:40] mde: I'm a JavaScript programmer, working for Yammer.
[22:41] Brandon_R: how much money do you make?
[22:41] mde: No low-level stuff, but both server and client JS.
[22:41] mde: I make enough to live comfortably out here in SF.
[22:41] mde: Any good developer can, there's tremendous competition for hiring here.
[22:41] martin_sunset: Mde, for someone moving to SF, what neighborhoods would you recommend? 
[22:42] Brandon_R: is a college degree required for jobs or can you get by with "experience"

[22:44] Brandon_R: oh i want to go to college
[22:44] Brandon_R: just not for computer science
[22:44] Brandon_R: physics
[22:44] Brandon_R: ahh
[22:44] mde: Right on. 
[22:44] Brandon_R: english is probably the one thing i cannot learn

[22:45] mde: Yammer is the most diverse I've ever seen -- backgrounds, race, gender. All of it. :)
[22:45] Brandon_R: do you do the hiring?
[22:46] Brandon_R: do you guys ask weird questions? or straight up questions
[22:46] mde: No, but we all have say-so through the process for any prospect for our team.
[22:46] Brandon_R: one company asked "How many concurrent users are online on facebook on tuesday?"
[22:46] mde: We don't ask those silly hypothetical things.
[22:46] mde: Or brain-teasers.
[22:47] Brandon_R: good :)
[22:47] Brandon_R: :)
[22:47] Brandon_R: they test your responce to social situations more than it does to technology

[22:47] mde: I hate that shit. :)
[22:47] Brandon_R: do you get up and leave or bs your way through it
[22:48] mde: We do want people who are social, communicate well.
[22:48] mde: And who understand product. 
[22:48] mde: Because the engineers have so much influence on it.
[22:48] Brandon_R: cool
[22:48] mde: Shit, I gotta go. Having people over soon. Y'all have a great NYE. :)

[22:58] Brandon_R: not taking a new years night off?
[22:58] Brandon_R: i'm all alone here so it doesn't matter
[22:58] eastc: just trying to jazz up the sign up part on the index page
[22:58] richardr: mde: woah, Yammer seems like an awesome app. Never heard of it until just now
[22:59] eastc: i'm actually kind of new to node all together but I've been reading all sorts of stuff
[22:59] richardr: mde: How does it perform as a platform, good APIs?
[22:59] eastc: I wish documentation for express, jade, stylus and node was all centralized
[23:03] mikeal has joined the channel
[23:03] RLa: someone should write book on them
[23:04] eastc: someone should
[23:04] eastc: something that clearly guides new people
[23:05] eastc: but I can understand why there isn't something like this yet
[23:05] RLa: too bad that when book is ready, most of its contents is obsolete already
[23:05] eastc: yea I know right
[23:05] eastc: well
[23:05] eastc: reading the docs will have to do for now
[23:05] eastc: i guess
[23:06] RLa: also, read source
[23:06] RLa: lot of node packages have quite trivial code
[23:06] eastc: source for node?
[23:06] eastc: oh yea
[23:06] eastc: true
[23:06] eastc: i really wish the node modules page would get cleaned up
[23:06] eastc: there are so many extraneous/outdated/replaced modules on there

[23:52] al3xnull: My bad. Forgot that this laptop has an outdated version of node.js. 
[23:53] davidedwardclark: nodes = nodejs
