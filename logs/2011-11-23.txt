[00:09] justmoon: SteveDekorte, can you post the whole error you're getting when compiling my branch on your system?
[00:10] context: i mean why tokyo cabinet, did you start this project with node 0.1 or something
[00:10] justmoon: they stuff you posted is just waf bailing out , the actual errors should be right before that
[00:10] SteveDekorte: context: my project requires a minimal persistent btree API with transactions and cursor support
[00:10] context: tokyo cabinet hasn't been touched in over a year, and there are plenty better options im sure
[00:10] context: sqlite?
[00:10] justmoon: SteveDekorte, then use LevelDB
[00:10] context: or level
[00:10] squeeks: kyoto cabinet?
[00:11] mandric has joined the channel
[00:11] justmoon: SteveDekorte, do you need binary safe or just strings
[00:11] SteveDekorte: justmoon: binary safe values (but not keys), does it support cursors? transactions?
[00:12] SteveDekorte: also, it must be a direct binding API, not networked based
[00:12] justmoon: SteveDekorte, yes, leveldb supports both
[00:12] context: do i wanna know what this is for :x
[00:12] Lingerance: squeeks: buff instanceof Buffer
[00:12] squeeks: ta
[00:12] SteveDekorte: I really don't want to rewrite all my code right now

[02:35] Murvin: req.body is empty..and nowhere in teh req object has "mydata".   hmmm   
[02:36] deoxxa: Murvin: http connections aren't buffered in node
[02:36] Murvin: deoxxa: what do u mean by that?
[02:37] deoxxa: Murvin: you'll want to use something like `request.on("data", function(chunk) { do_something_with_data(chunk); });' - or use something like express that can take care of that for you
[02:37] Murvin: yes.. i m using that.
[02:37] Murvin: i m using express.
[02:38] Murvin: ok..let's put it this way.. my node program send out POST or GET requests without any problem.
[02:38] deoxxa: ah, ok. you didn't mention that at first.
[02:38] Murvin: oh...:D
[02:38] deoxxa: are you using express.bodyParser or anything like that?
[02:38] Murvin: so.. eay..   so,. If I put my data in the url query, e.g. subject=ABCDE     in both GET and POST, it works.
[02:39] dgathright has joined the channel
[02:39] Murvin: but if I want to put the data in the POST body, I use the http.clientRequest   .write('mydata\n');   and it doesn't seems to work.
[02:39] Murvin: yes.. i m using express.bodyParser.
[02:39] harthur has joined the channel
[02:39] deoxxa: ok, bodyParser will take over req.body
[02:40] Murvin: weird thing is.. i have another call., which send out XML data, and no problem...
[02:40] deoxxa: so you have to choose one or the other
[02:40] deoxxa: you either want the body to be parsed, or you don't
[02:40] adwong has joined the channel
[02:40] deoxxa: or you can use it per-url by putting it before your callback
[02:40] Murvin: Hmmm in my POST, i would like to send out the data like that:   http.clientRequest  .write('subject=TEST&message=123131321');
[02:41] deoxxa: i.e. app.post("/something", express.bodyParser, function(req, res) { ... });
[02:41] Murvin: hmm i have tested it already..  I don't see any data in body.. :(  
[02:41] Murvin: I even search for the req boject..

[05:57] blueadept: quick question: what happens if you hash a hash to the nth power?
[05:58] blueadept: in mathematical terms...
[05:58] maxogden: logarithmic diminishing returns
[05:58] blueadept: hm, i see
[05:58] zivester has joined the channel
[05:59] isaacs: blueadept: what do you mean "to the nth power"?
[05:59] isaacs: like, hash it n times?
[05:59] blueadept: well, hash, then hash that hash plus epoch time (perhaps), rinse repeat
[06:00] blueadept: thats a pretty good random number generator, no?
[06:00] isaacs: if you add the epoch time (and you don't save that) then your one-way hash has become a zero-way hash.
[06:00] blueadept: damnit
[06:00] pquerna: mikeal, jebus
[06:00] isaacs: but, if it's a good distributed hash (like, say, sha1 or sha256) then all youve done is created a new hash, which is equivalent, but with increased the computational cost of 
[06:00] isaacs: computing it.
[06:01] blueadept: right
[06:01] isaacs: if it's *not* well distributed (such as md5) then you've created a likely less-distributed hash, which is also more expensive.
[06:01] jbraffoul has joined the channel
[06:01] localhost has joined the channel
[06:02] isaacs: however, that's effectively how bcrypt works.  by arbitrarily setting the computational cost of a hash, you can *force* it to take a certain amount of time, to thwart attacks.
[06:03] Aria: Specifically a brute force attack, especially checking for likely-known plaintexts, in the case of bcrypt.
[06:03] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[06:03] pquerna: well, the other 'nice' thing about bcrypt, is you basicaly store the 'how difficult' part of it like the salt
[06:03] pquerna: so its stored inline with it
[06:03] Lorentz: is it really random if you hash from a known seed?
[06:03] Lorentz: no matter how many times you hash it
[06:04] pquerna: making it easy for it to be incrementally updated
[06:04] jbrokc_ has joined the channel
[06:04] Aria: Yeah. 'tunable'
[06:04] Lorentz: If you wanted to add a random variable to number of times you hash, wouldn't it be easier to just use that random variable.
[06:04] maxogden: tunable? i dont even like fish!
[06:04] Aria: Lorentz: It's not random, that's the thing. It's deep.
[06:04] pquerna: Lorentz: actually, thats.. hash chaining, its what S/Key is built on
[06:04] blueadept: Loretz: well, presumably
[06:04] blueadept: but if you have epoch + miliseconds

[06:09] Aria: Those aren't random letters. It's hexadecimal.
[06:09] blueadept: oh shiz
[06:09] Lorentz: Typical hash.
[06:09] blueadept: Aria: damn i feel dumb
[06:09] Aria: 32-characters, that's 16-byte, or 128-bit.
[06:09] blueadept: you're right

[06:12] blueadept: its longer
[06:13] blueadept: its more intimidating perhaps 
[06:13] pquerna: use bcrypt. its not.
[06:13] Aria: That's not actually the feature you want in a password hash.
[06:13] blueadept: that way if someone breaks in they'll be like "?man fuck this shit"
[06:13] Aria: You want it to be expensive to compute.
[06:13] pquerna: no, they won't, infact your strategy was one that Jira did.

[06:15] SteveDekorte: node-waf did it - thanks :)
[06:15] blueadept: Aria: what's a good way of encrypting the pass then?
[06:15] Aria: bcrypt.
[06:15] blueadept: ahok 
[06:15] Aria: Instead of lengthening the hash, you do more rounds -- more rounds means more computation time.
[06:15] blueadept: ahh
[06:15] Aria: Which means more resources to brute-force.
[06:15] blueadept: ok that makes more sense then
[06:15] Aria: Yeah.
[06:15] blueadept: exponential cryptography
[06:16] Aria: You salt simply -- that just has to be random enough to perturb the hash so you can't use a rainbow table.
[06:16] Aria: Stronger salt buys you little.

[06:30] richardr: Anyone know of good boilerplate / application frameworks for Node.js that are built around Express, for example Expressling alternatives? Preferably something with localization/translations
[06:31] garrensmith has joined the channel
[06:32] blueadept: richardr: if you know or are aware of coffeescript, zappa is an option
[06:32] garrensmith: morning

[06:33] dreamdust: I can't stand how the HTML5 boilerplates call themselves "Rock-solid" when it's anything but.
[06:33] richardr: blueadept: Localization with minimal dependencies and abstraction, using memory storage (mongo, local memory) is something im really looking for.
[06:33] zeade has joined the channel
[06:34] blueadept: well if you need memory storage just hookup redis
[06:34] TheCode has joined the channel
[06:34] dreamdust: Express is built on Connect. To me that is a boilerplate. You already have auth and caching modules for connect and express.
[06:34] blueadept: in fact i think redis is now the defacto standard
[06:34] TheCode: anyone tried railwayjs?

[06:36] blueadept: actually no

[06:52] isaacs: AAA_awright: because that would confound the name portion of the named function declaration
[06:53] isaacs: AAA_awright: what would this be?   (function a.b.c () {}).name
[06:53] Aria: c!
[06:53] isaacs: AAA_awright: "a.b.c"?  or just "c"?
[06:53] isaacs: that's confusing
[06:53] jbrokc_ has joined the channel
[06:53] isaacs: desugared to a.b.c = function c (){} then?
[06:53] isaacs: would it be hoisted?
[06:53] AAA_awright: It must be undefined any other way, so leave it undefined if nothing else
[06:54] isaacs: what about this?   a.b.c.prototype = {...};  function a.b.c () {}
[06:54] isaacs: if it's hoisted, would it be hoisted above the definition of a.b?
[06:55] isaacs: dots in function names would be handy in a few trivial cases, but too hard, i think
[06:55] AAA_awright: You have the same problem without the syntax in question... a.b.c.prototype = {...};   a.b.c = function () {}
[06:55] AAA_awright: a.b.c.prototype is clobbered
[06:55] isaacs: AAA_awright: right
[06:55] isaacs: AAA_awright: but you don't with named function declarations
[06:55] isaacs: a.b.c = c;  c.prototype = { ... }; function c () {}
[06:56] AAA_awright: The issue is named functions come into scope even before they're executed, then
[06:56] AAA_awright: How would that be handled? Good point
[06:56] isaacs: so, you'd have to desugar it to a function expression and assignment, not a function declaration
[06:56] isaacs: function declarations are like var statements: they're hoisted to the top of scope
[06:56] AAA_awright: s/executed/read-or-whatever/
[06:57] richardr: woah, the dialect module for Node.js is pretty awesome
[06:57] isaacs: which is a bit of a misnomer.  i believe the spec describes it as a two-phase parse, where the first phase parses var and decls only
[06:57] p1d has joined the channel
[06:58] AAA_awright: Hoisted to the top of the scope?
[06:58] Marko: so i have maid all my changes to master all the time, but fork host told to merge changes to the other branch. i just dont know how to do it. i cant see any commands from web ui or mac client

[07:19] davidbanham: richardr: It looks like the package you've downloaded doesn't include all the build deps. Not sure what it is you're installing, but can you install it through npm rather than downloading the source yourself?

[16:36] booyaa: marcello3d: i guess the benefit of that way is that you can run different versions of the modules for those projects?
[16:36] brianc: booyaa: I have no global packages except supervisor and npm
[16:37] lamp_: i am trying to connect to a mongodb inside a forked child process and i get a host unreachable error.  i can connect in the parent node process.  any ideas?
[16:37] marcello3d: booyaa: I guess. are global packages even accessible by node by default?
[16:37] brianc: marcello3d: yes. require eventually traverses up into the global package install directory; local packages have precedent 
[16:37] cfq has joined the channel
[16:38] brianc: booyaa: there are a lot of reasons not to use global packages.  i like to keep them all local to the app so the app is entirely contained.  step 1: clone git repo. step 2: npm install. step 3: start app. step 4: profit.

[20:34] snowinferno: Is it generally considered poor form to add an eventlistener to an object from within another event listner for the same event? For example, I want one set of logic to occur the first time the data event for a socket fires but a different set of logic for each subsequent time unless circumstances dictate it should repeat the first-time logic (such as a bad password).
[20:34] DrHeiter23: just keep state

I'm looking again to make sure I'm really acting on my custom object instead of the raw socket but both of them should have the once method
[20:38] DrHeiter23: MooGoo: well not really, "unless circumstances dictate it should repeat the first-time logic "

[22:30] xetorthio: What could cause a "Error: getaddrinfo ENOENT" when doing an http request?
[22:30] EhevuTov has joined the channel
[22:30] TheJH: SteveDekorte, so, did you update node?
[22:30] SteveDekorte: TheJH: I upgraded to node 0.6.2 and now it compiles but the test doesn't run
[22:30] TheJH: xetorthio, I'd say not existing hostname
[22:30] SteveDekorte: I've emailed the author but I guess I should post an issue as well
[22:31] TheJH: SteveDekorte, the author of node-nacl?
[22:31] xetorthio: TheJH, it is weird. it started to happen after moving to node 0.6.2, code hasn't changed, so I guess host is not the cause
[22:31] SteveDekorte: TheJH: yeah

[22:32] Guest9657: At the risk of sounding like the noob that I am what's the deal with make install on 0.6.2?
[22:32] SteveDekorte: oh, sorry, I mixed up the url - I meant node-rsa :)
[22:32] devdazed: anyone have any idea about this? https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/2175
[22:32] SteveDekorte: I can't get node-nacl to compile at all
[22:33] TheJH: SteveDekorte, what's the error?
[22:33] SteveDekorte: no message - it just compiles forever at 100% cpu
[22:33] TheJH: SteveDekorte, not forever
[22:33] SteveDekorte: I think I let it run for 30 minutes
[22:34] TheJH: SteveDekorte, from the readme: "This takes some time because there's a long benchmark that takes place after the actual C++ library got compiled. Didn't measure the time, but it's more than a few minutes."
[22:34] SteveDekorte: no messages or output but my laptop was getting pretty hot
[22:34] TheJH: SteveDekorte, hmm, 30min is long
[22:34] TheJH: SteveDekorte, yes, it doesn't do any output
[22:34] SteveDekorte: ok, I'm trying to compile it again now - it's 2:34pm PST - let's see what happens :)
[22:35] TheJH: SteveDekorte, the author of nacl decided to put a big benchmark into the build process to choose optimal implementations
[22:35] jmar777 has joined the channel
[22:35] TheJH: SteveDekorte, I just wrote bindings and didn't want to mess around with their build process
[22:36] xetorthio: TheJH, yes, just checked and the Host is OK. actually I just curled with the same info and it works.
[22:36] xetorthio: TheJH, but it doesn't happen always. only sometimes. can it have something to do with the new global http agent?
[22:36] TheJH: xetorthio, what are the contents of /etc/resolv.conf?
[22:36] TheJH: xetorthio, what OS/distro are you using?
[22:37] xetorthio: TheJH, nameserver 8.8.8.8

[22:37] TheJH: xetorthio, mhm, sounds good

[22:37] TheJH: xetorthio, does nslookup on the hostname work?
[22:37] creationix has joined the channel
[22:38] xetorthio: TheJH, sure nslookup sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com works just fine. also doing a curl works fine. it is just that sometimes node.js, under heavy load, throws this error
[22:38] SteveDekorte: TheJH: do you know of any other RSA packages for node that you can recommend?
[22:38] johnnywengluu: tjholowaychuk: OMG you did it again!
[22:38] SteveDekorte: TheJH: I'd really like a pure Javascript one that works on node and in the browser
[22:39] johnnywengluu: http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/
[22:39] johnnywengluu: tjholowaychuk: does this mean that expresso is deprecated?
[22:39] tjholowaychuk: johnnywengluu nope, but if you do want to use mocha you can use the exports interface
[22:39] tjholowaychuk: it's pretty much identical
[22:39] tjholowaychuk: just not a sloppy hack like expresso
[22:40] cha0s has joined the channel
[22:40] cha0s has joined the channel
[22:40] TheJH: SteveDekorte, I think node 0.6.2 got RSA in core
[22:40] johnnywengluu: could you say expresso = tdd and mocha = bdd
[22:40] TheJH: SteveDekorte, but I don't know any pure JS implementations
[22:40] tjholowaychuk: johnnywengluu: ex: https://github.com/LearnBoost/tobi/commit/00896798c5c27301763851f00471fe8c6366d39d
[22:41] SteveDekorte: TheJH: the node 0.6.2 doesn't appear to support RSA key gen or encryption, just signing AFAICT

[22:46] tjholowaychuk: just build stuff i want mostly
[22:47] tjholowaychuk: expresso was a quick hack to scratch an itch when i was working on connect/express
[22:47] tjholowaychuk: and it works fine for stuff like that but for testing larger apps it's a bit of a PITA
[22:47] johnnywengluu: this one reminds me about Jasmine

[23:13] ovaillancourt: I know it might be a bit random for a question, but is there any known problem with node concerning base64 encoding? I'm using emailjs which encodes html mails in base64 (using toString) but the encoding seems to break at some point and decoding only returns garbage.
