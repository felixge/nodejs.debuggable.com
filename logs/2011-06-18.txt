[02:32] fatblueduck: and so when you create a new page for your site... you _only_ make a document that expresses the content of the body?

[03:44] chapel: SubStack: would there be an easy way to lets say instead of bundling every jquery plugin as its own module, to have it be an interconnected module that is only called once, all in one folder under node_modules?
[03:44] cconstantine has joined the channel
[03:45] SubStack: what's the difference?
[03:45] chapel: well not having to make a new package file
[03:46] chapel: and wrap each one
[03:46] chapel: idk
[03:46] chapel: Im half tempted to just take jquery out of browserify and and include it old school
[03:46] SubStack: yes you can do that
[03:47] chapel: just happens we are using a lot of jquery plugins, would be easier than having to make modules for each of them

[03:51] jslatts: Old European. Sorensen and I will be there + a few other local hacker types.
[03:52] jslatts: I just moved here about a year ago. trying to meet some other like minded folks. especially noders

[03:54] chapel: I will have to think about it, my gf is staying with me this week, and I would hate to abandon her
[03:54] chapel: carb eating optional?

[04:46] tiglionabbit: stuff that stays around if node goes down
[04:46] tiglionabbit: a database
[04:47] Aria: For filesystem shaped things, the filesystem. For basic-datastructure-shaped things, redis. For web service shaped things, various web services. for versioned filesystem like things, git.
[04:47] Aria: for relational data, postgresql.
[04:48] tiglionabbit: I'm tempted to use pg, but serializing my data into SQL statements is no fun.  I looked at FastLegS, but I'm not sure how I could use that /and/ get arbitrary SQL when i need it...
[04:48] woot130837250593 has joined the channel
[04:48] tiglionabbit: as for redis, isn't that entirely in memory?  What if you run out of memory?
[04:50] Nexxy_ has joined the channel
[04:50] tiglionabbit: oh yeah, node is single threaded -- do people ever run multiple processes of node to compensate?
[04:50] Aria: Sure.
[04:50] jhurliman: yep
[04:50] Aria: That's a GREAT way to do parallel processing.
[04:51] Aria: OSes already optimize it well ;-)
[04:51] Nexxy has joined the channel
[04:51] Aria: And redis, yes, is entirely in memory. It's fine for many workloads.
[04:51] Aria: (and it can be sharded)
[04:51] Aria: Also, mongodb and couchdb are popular.
[04:52] jhurliman: i usually go with mongodb or mysql, depending on the requirements

[04:53] tiglionabbit: doesn't mongodb make it really easy to clobber your data?

[04:54] brettgoulder has joined the channel
[04:54] jhurliman: not sure what you mean. 'DROP mytable;' is a pretty easy way to clobber your data

[04:55] tiglionabbit: well
[04:56] tiglionabbit: how do you model your data in it?
[04:56] tiglionabbit: like, lets say you have a document that represents threaded comments
[04:56] tiglionabbit: what if two agents try to add comments to it at the same time?  You can't really do that atomically
[04:57] jhurliman: http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Atomic+Operations
[04:57] jhurliman: $push
[04:57] Aria: Yeah. Push.
[04:57] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[04:58] Aria: And yes, you want to mapreduce to precompute various things. Have a master copy of your data. But don't store JUST a normalized copy.
[04:59] Aria: No need to rejoin for every query when your queries are all like. Look at what you're asking for, and build it.

[05:23] Marak: jslatts: there is no hook for cleanups after each run no matter what though

[05:23] jslatts: marak: k, just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something obvious
[05:23] jslatts: Marak: seems like asserts don't block execution though, so I can cleanup in the test after a failure

[08:00] NuckingFuts: I'm gonna be coding an algorithm to handle that
[08:00] Skola: for real artists anyway
[08:01] Skola: but you might not be targeting those?
[08:01] vdemedes has joined the channel
[08:01] NuckingFuts: Skola: No, actually, it's a good thing.  It'll help get the better artists publicity.
[08:01] vdemedes has left the channel
[08:02] Skola: how is that?
[08:02] NuckingFuts: Basically, I take the tags on the current image, and apply a search algorithm with them all,  then I have a sorting algorithm based on a mixture of relevance and popularity and such
[08:03] Skola: that's excellent for trendwhore art
[08:03] NuckingFuts: Skola: If it's good artwork, it should stay popular
[08:03] NuckingFuts: It'll also weigh based on the quality of artists who like that art, etc.
[08:04] NuckingFuts: I've got quite a powerful algorithm lined up for all this
[08:04] Skola: just don't have it turn out to be a Miss contest
[08:04] Skola: which is why real artists shun DA
[08:04] NuckingFuts: Skola: Don't worry, it'll be based on your own tastes mostly
[08:04] NuckingFuts: The goal is to show you content that YOU will like.
[08:05] zomgbie has joined the channel
[08:05] NuckingFuts: Not content that is popular in general.
[08:05] Skola: how will you do that?
[08:05] Skola: by genre?
[08:05] Skola: if it's a general algorhythm you run the risk of boxing people in
[08:05] NuckingFuts: Skola: Not genres, it's more like the tags on Danboory
[08:05] NuckingFuts: *danbooru
[08:05] Skola: ok
[08:05] cachemoney has joined the channel
[08:06] NuckingFuts: and it weighs the tags of art you like, fave, comment on, etc. (each one has a different weight to it)
[08:06] NuckingFuts: It's gonna be a living hell to optimize
[08:06] Skola: nah sounds like fun :p
[08:06] NuckingFuts: But I think if anything can handle it, NodeJS can :D
[08:07] NuckingFuts: I mean, I'll keep a cache of the user's tastes in the database
[08:07] NuckingFuts: And whip it out as needed
[08:07] jakeg has joined the channel
[08:08] Skola: do you have a "main idea"
[08:08] NuckingFuts: "main idea"?
[08:08] Skola: a one sentence salespitch
[08:08] Skola: ;p
[08:09] NuckingFuts: Skola: "Our frontpage isn't furries and fanart (unless you like that stuff)"
[08:09] Skola: excellent :D

[08:16] NuckingFuts: Skola: My other sales pitch (to prospective investors) is "I built this site in 2 months.  My team consisted of myself (17), a Kiwi (18), and a designer friend of mine (16) - if we can manage that, we can manage anything."
[08:16] neoesque has joined the channel
[08:17] NuckingFuts: :P
[08:17] asdfsafdsa: a kiwi?
[08:17] NuckingFuts: asdfsafdsa: Yes, a sheepshagger.
[08:17] Skola: lol
[08:18] Skola: yeah I think that'll go down well with investors : D
[08:18] Skola: but it's not a good pitch
[08:18] NuckingFuts: Skola: lol it's true though :P
[08:18] NuckingFuts: No code has been written yet, the database lies empty, but right now, it's at that phase of just staring at the block of marble and visualizing.
[08:19] Skola: stop staring
[08:19] Skola: start writing
[08:19] NuckingFuts: And by that I mean I'm writing copious amounts of markdown to document our API
[08:19] Skola: oh right
[08:19] Skola: that's better
[08:19] NuckingFuts: And then based on those docs, I get to program the API
[08:19] Skola: not a bad approach, if you're experienced : p
[08:19] NuckingFuts: Then I pass the torch to the Kiwi and designer, as they whip up designs and HTML/CSS
[08:20] NuckingFuts: Skola: Never made an API in my life XD
[08:20] NuckingFuts: But I've got my ideas
[08:20] Skola: if you haven't built an API before, I suggest you start implementing some things
[08:20] NuckingFuts: And I know what I want :P
[08:20] NuckingFuts: Skola: It's all using ExpressJS
[08:20] NuckingFuts: The biggest problem I can forsee is the damned authentication
[08:20] NuckingFuts: ESPECIALLY with GET
[08:20] NuckingFuts: I can auth easily on POST, just send a token
[08:21] NuckingFuts: But GET?  I don't even know :/
[08:21] Skola: mongoose-auth and express-auth
[08:21] NuckingFuts: It's hard to keep to REST
[08:21] simenbrekken has joined the channel
[08:21] NuckingFuts: Skola: Not using Mongoose
[08:21] Skola: ah right
[08:21] NuckingFuts: Just regular Mongo
[08:21] Skola: well there's a couple of modules
[08:21] NuckingFuts: Mongoose makes me vomit.
[08:21] Nexxy_ has joined the channel
[08:21] Skola: how come
[08:22] NuckingFuts: I tried it once, it kept giving inexplicable issues and made me do silly shit.
[08:22] NuckingFuts: I just switched to Mongo-native
[08:22] NuckingFuts: And I love it
[08:23] NuckingFuts: I need to find a way to allow either OAuth or regular authentication :V
[08:23] Skola: or both
[08:23] NuckingFuts: Because this API will be used on-site
[08:23] NuckingFuts: And by app developers
[08:23] NuckingFuts: Hmmmm...
[08:23] Skola: y not use express-auth
[08:24] asdf22 has joined the channel
[08:24] Skola: or everyauth
[08:25] NuckingFuts: Skola: express-auth looks outdated
[08:25] NuckingFuts: I mean, no npm
[08:25] Skola: everyauth is very active
[08:25] NuckingFuts: srsly, wtf is kiwi, anyways?
[08:25] NuckingFuts: Skola: Yeah, I was looking at that earlier on NPM's site
[08:25] Skola: https://github.com/bnoguchi/everyauth
[08:27] Yoric has joined the channel
[08:27] NuckingFuts: Skola: It's not quite what I'm looking for.  The main thing I want is a basic skeleton of an auth system, where I can drop in any handlers I want and just call a function to start their session :S

[08:47] NuckingFuts: Skola: I disagree :/
[08:47] NuckingFuts: I memorized jQuery using a cheatsheet
[08:48] Skola: I memorized 3000 unix commands / utilities when I was 13
[08:48] NuckingFuts: Daaaaaaamn
[08:48] Skola: (on a holiday too)
[08:48] NuckingFuts: Skola: I learned BASIC when I was 7
[08:48] Skola: I did Lambda Calculus when I was 3
[08:48] NuckingFuts: Tried Perl when I was 11
[08:48] NuckingFuts: Tried PHP around 12-3
[08:48] NuckingFuts: *13
[08:48] NuckingFuts: And then stopped coding for a few years
[08:49] Skola: no but what I was gonna say: nowadays I use something just once and I remember it
[08:49] NuckingFuts: Skola: I can remember most of the commands on Mongo, just not all the console ones
[08:49] NuckingFuts: I'm still yearning for a visual interface for mongo
[08:50] NuckingFuts: A *Good* one
[08:50] NuckingFuts: Showing it as a tree diagram
[08:50] Skola: write one : P
[08:50] NuckingFuts: Skola: I can make websites in HTML, but I can't make crazy curvy lines :P
[08:50] Skola: use a library
[08:51] Skola: like RaphaelJS
[08:51] NuckingFuts: Or any lines that aren't straight, for that matter :P
[08:51] NuckingFuts: Skola: I might as well just do it using embedded SVG or Canvas
[08:51] NuckingFuts: But still, I've got websites to program :D
[08:51] Skola: sure but small sideprojects are nice to do
[08:52] NuckingFuts: ACTION goes back to stitching ExpressJS's mouth onto the anus of MongoDB
[08:52] NuckingFuts: Skola: Oh you don't even know lol
[08:52] NuckingFuts: I've got at least 5 sideprojects already
[08:52] Skola: yeah that's not so nice generally : P
[08:52] NuckingFuts: For the next two months, however, I'm tunnelvisioning this shit.
[08:53] NuckingFuts: My chance to be awesome has come.
[08:53] NuckingFuts: And I won't give up no matter what.
[08:53] Skola: I know what that's like
[08:53] Skola: remember to STEP BACK once in a while
[08:53] NuckingFuts: Skola: As in?
[08:53] Skola: you'll most likely add features that you didnt think through
[08:53] Skola: which is ok
[08:54] Skola: just make sure you "kill your darlings" when you know you have to

[08:57] Skola: my blog (with small CMS) went from 900 LOC to 1400 to 800
[08:57] Skola: LOC including stylesheets, serverside stuff, templates, forms, clientside jQuery
[08:57] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: Haha
[08:58] NuckingFuts: Skola: In past, I rewrite every time I get better at code.
[08:58] Skola: I do it aggressively
[08:58] Skola: 50% new code 50% refactoring
[08:58] Skola: I don't write bad code to start with
[08:58] NuckingFuts: But now, I feel I'm almost to my limit in JavaScript, so I feel I won't need to recode most of it XD
[08:58] Skola: lol you must be god then
[08:59] junkee[]: Does anyone know if the destructor of a c++ class is called when the v8 javascript object is garbage collected or how to know if the JS reference is lost?

[09:01] Skola: you did mostly client-side I assume?
[09:01] NuckingFuts: :(
[09:01] Skola: bad sentence, but yeah
[09:01] NuckingFuts: Skola: Well, I did PHP and JS
[09:01] Skola: yes but I mean your JS?
[09:02] NuckingFuts: Yeah, though I did dabble a bit in SSJS when Aptana Jaxer came around, and again when I found this Firefox addon that was a server
[09:02] NuckingFuts: But not much
[09:02] NuckingFuts: Most of my work has been in GreaseMonkey
[09:02] Skola: hairy business :D

[09:13] Skola: I usually am suspicious of them
[09:14] NuckingFuts: And then there's me, our API programmer/designer who is mainly doing the initial design mockups which will be fed to our designer for further tweaking
[09:14] NuckingFuts: Skola: Other guy is aaronpearce.com
[09:14] NuckingFuts: As for me, I lack a website still

[09:19] is_null: hi all, i'm trying to do first steps in node.js, but i can't connect to the server: http://dpaste.com/555806/
[09:19] NuckingFuts: ACTION has The Oatmeal's GayRoller image pop into his head
[09:19] is_null: it says "Starting server on port: 8080" but the port is not open according to netstat -a
[09:20] is_null: any idea what could be the probleme ?
[09:20] ekes: NuckingFuts: http://fastcache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/8/2009/08/tkdomain.jpg
[09:20] ekes: just what it says on the side of the van.
[09:20] ekes: (in dutch ;)
[09:20] mscdex: is_null: why are you trying to curl on port 9124 when it's listening on 8080?
[09:20] NuckingFuts: ekes: Wow
[09:21] NuckingFuts: mscdex: Wait, what?  /me goes to see this
[09:21] is_null: mscdex: wrong copy paste, i tried the default port and an arbitrary on, i'll retest properly
[09:22] mscdex: is_null: you're not specifying the port to listen on
[09:22] mscdex: is_null: all you do is print out the port number, not actually use it
[09:22] NuckingFuts: Skola: You know, you don't HAVE to join a local startup, right?

[09:23] Skola: , yet
[09:23] NuckingFuts: Look at me! I'm in a startup with folks in NEW ZEALAND? You know what time it is there?  It's tomorrow-o-clock! lol
[09:23] mscdex: Skola: only 4 months? what did you do before?
[09:23] is_null: mscdex: thanks, this means i must get into app.listen() and figure why it's not openning the port
[09:23] NuckingFuts: Skola: Well, if you need a design gig, we might be needing a designer if ours flakes out on us :P
[09:24] Skola: yes if you pay me
[09:24] is_null: yes, i should pass the port ...
[09:24] NuckingFuts: Skola: lol I can pay you in hugs :P
[09:24] is_null: it works! thanks mscdex 
[09:24] NuckingFuts: Or bitcoins
[09:24] mscdex: is_null: cool :-)

[09:47] Skola: in denial

[10:18] cachemoney: and yes, you should put all your modules under node_modules
[10:18] madsleejensen: when working with the filesystem, some methods takes in a "fd" which you received by opening a file for example, what is "fd" short for ? 
[10:19] cachemoney: shafire: are they modules you have written or modules on npm?
[10:19] cachemoney: madsleejensen: file descriptor
[10:20] shafire: i wrote it
[10:20] madsleejensen: cachemoney: thank you :)
[10:21] cachemoney: shafire: yeah, it's best to keep it under node_modules. i guess you *could* add to require.paths but it is discouraged.
[10:21] dragnl0rd: wy is require.paths discouraged?
[10:21] dragnl0rd: why*
[10:22] cachemoney: dragnl0rd: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.8/api/modules.html#loading_from_the_require.paths_Folders look at "**Note:** Please Avoid Modifying `require.paths`"

[10:29] cachemoney: dragnl0rd: if you're appending absolute paths to require.paths, what's wrong with using the system-wide include dir (e.g. /usr/local/lib/node)

[10:30] cachemoney: which is what npm does when you run it with -g

[11:37] is_null: cachemoney: isn't stitch responsible for package bundling ?
[11:37] Guest66094: CoverSlide: thank you
[11:38] is_null: cachemoney: if the app module is supposed to be exported to the browser, i think stitch is the responsible
[11:38] is_null: but i have 2 hours of experience so don't take it too seriously :)
[11:38] cachemoney: is_null: yup, seems like it. is app not being exported at all? or is it just require failing?
[11:41] is_null: according to the code of require, module name is checked against cache and modules "array" keys, but the debugger demonstrates that modules has no 'app'
[11:41] cachemoney: is_null: wait, is app.coffee even getting compiled into js?
[11:41] is_null: good question
[11:42] is_null: how could i figure ? if it ought to be compiled into js, shouldn't it be compiled into the dynamic /application.js ?
[11:42] is_null: because that's not the case
[11:42] cachemoney: is_null: manually compile it maybe?
[11:42] dragnl0rd: fnando: is the collection very large, or did the command just not return anything
[11:43] is_null: cachemoney: maybe, but the tutorial states "Using Spine.App is great way of structuring your application, managing dependencies and automatically compiling CoffeeScript and LessCSS files. "
[11:43] is_null: "Any CoffeeScript or LessCSS files inside the application will be automatically compiled when requested, you don't need to worry about compiling them manually."
[11:44] is_null: so maybe if i could figure what spine code is supposed to do that then i could move on ...
[11:45] is_null: actually, it might also be the responsability of an express middleware that's supposed to compile coffee into js
[11:46] cachemoney: is_null: how do you compile when the compiler is nowhere to be found?

[13:21] dtan_: and it installed v0.5.0-pre
[13:21] jscheel: dtan_: have you had good experiences with brew, I've always liked macports, because it builds everything independent of the libraries included in osx
[13:21] dtan_: but i couldn't switch to the v.0.4.8 tag and build from there
[13:22] dtan_: jscheel - i've only really used brew and not too much with macports, but brew has been good imo
[13:22] jscheel: dtan_: ah, cool
[13:22] cachemoney: "./configure; make; make install" ftw

[14:02] dragnl0rd: for native modules like http?  no...
[14:06] Epeli: Is npm working correctly for you guys?
[14:06] Epeli: npm install/link just freezes for me 
[14:10] Xenoraze: Well I no longer get the segmentation fault and debug actually works now (thanks cachemoney and jscheel) but there still seems to be some issues with listening on ports
[14:10] Skola: works fine for me Epeli
[14:10] telemachus: Epeli: What version of npm/node
[14:10] jscheel: Xenoraze: is this on your dev server or your production?
[14:11] telemachus: npm 1.0.13 and node 0.4.8 are all good for me
[14:11] jscheel: Xenoraze: if it's production, might be good to see if something else is already listening onthe port
[14:11] jscheel: Xenoraze: for example, if apache is already running and trying to listen on port 8-
[14:11] jscheel: 80
[14:12] Corren has joined the channel
[14:13] Xenoraze: when i node example.js and it's set to listen on a port my cli hangs until i ctrl+c and no response when trying http to that port via browser on desktop (remote) or lynx on the box (localhost)

[14:15] Xenoraze: yes
[14:15] mahna: (ja, post/gist your example)
[14:15] telemachus: Epeli: Huh. What OS? Is there anything unusual about the permissions where you are, maybe?
[14:15] Xenoraze: It's the helloworld example.js from the node website
[14:16] Epeli: telemachus:  Ubuntu Lucid. It is weird. Some times it goes through just fine.
[14:16] Epeli: Maybe it's just crappy internet here...
[14:16] telemachus: Maybe network issues then, if it's sporadic?

[14:19] mahna: Xenoraze: Did you already try a different port (like jscheel mentioned) and are you seeing the console output ("Server running..")?
[14:19] jscheel: Xenoraze: hmm, what happens if you run your app, and then telnet into it? "telnet 127.0.0.1 portnumber"
[14:19] Xenoraze: when i try console.log('hello world'); in a file it outputs fine, but the webserver example makes my cli hang until i ctrl+c
[14:19] jscheel: Xenoraze: yes, that is supposed to happen
[14:20] jscheel: Xenoraze: the http server stays open, so the event loop continues to run
[14:20] bogomips2: someone use a webscoket-server module ? i have a trouble with method "send" if the out data is not much light  nothing go out ! 
[14:20] mahna: jscheel: But I can't tell whether the initial log output is visible (the example outputs "Server running").
[14:23] mynyml has joined the channel
[14:24] jscheel: Xenoraze: just to clarify, you copied and pasted the example from the nodejs.org homepage, ran "node example.js", and tried to go to 127.0.0.1:1337 on your browser?

[14:26] jscheel: Xenoraze: and when you run "node example.js", you do not see "Server running at http://127.0.0.1:1337/" appear?
[14:26] Xenoraze: jscheel yes I see that
[14:26] jscheel: Xenoraze: ok, so, try "telnet 127.0.0.1 1337"
[14:27] jscheel: Xenoraze: then "GET / HTTP/1.1", hit enter, then type "host: 127.0.0.1", then hit enter twice
[14:28] CoverSlide: you did lynx localhost:1337 ?
[14:29] Xenoraze: jscheel that worked
[14:29] boogyman has joined the channel
[14:29] jscheel: Xenoraze: ok, so it's up and working. I think CoverSlide is on to it, are you specifying the port in lynx?
[14:30] jscheel: Xenoraze: browsers will automatically assume port 80, unless told otherwise
[14:31] Xenoraze: Okay now that works via lynx too after going back to 1337... been trying different ports

[15:37] anno^da: Yesterday the same code had been working.

[15:37] devdazed has joined the channel

[21:52] xerox: that seems strange

[21:53] bnoordhuis: t|f: not a nvm user myself but probably - 0.5.0-pre is unstable / master
[21:53] xerox: https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/http.js#L1001
[21:53] xerox: anno^da ^
[21:55] brfelipe: t|f: that link still doesnt say anything about changing the install location of the dependencies :\
[21:56] Skola: could someone goto http://dro.no.de for me real quick and tell me what error firebug spits out?
[21:56] anno^da: xerox: Ok so I should be able to catch the 2 minute timeout the same way I catch the error event ?
[21:56] xerox: exactly
[21:56] xerox: with an addListener/on
[21:57] t|f: Yeah, looks like neither nave nor nvm allow switching to master, just have to build by hand
[21:58] anno^da: xerox: Thank you very much. I will try that one out.
[21:59] hermanjunge: landeiro: check your mailbox
[22:00] Skola: could someone do me a favour and check http://dro.no.de and tell me what error firebug/chrome console gives you?
[22:01] Skola: because weirdly enough it works fine for me, but not for my gf, nor with one of my proxy's
[22:01] t|f: hermanjunge: If you found problem landeiro posted about I'd be interested in where it's throwing that error too
[22:01] _Sorensen: i dont get one
[22:01] Skola: it loads properly?
[22:01] _Sorensen: yes in chrome
[22:01] Skola: I knew it was my gf
[22:01] Skola: such a tart with computers
[22:01] aaronblohowiak: Skola: works for me

[22:02] mt3ck_: works for me but do get an uncaught exception in ff error console for the site
[22:02] Skola: alright
[22:02] mt3ck_: Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Node cannot be inserted at the specified point in the hierarchy"  code: "3" nsresult: "0x80530003 (NS_ERROR_DOM_HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR)"  location: "https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.min.js Line: 18"]
[22:02] t|f: landeiro: I was thinking on the net.createConnection call  @ http.js:1360
[22:02] xerox: anno^da: no problem!
[22:02] Skola: holy shizzle
[22:02] hermanjunge: t|f:  I've found it, native code function channel.getDomain() throws the 'EBADNAME, Misformatted domain name' Error
[22:03] bogomips2_ has joined the channel
[22:03] Skola: thanks mt3ck_ will take a look
[22:03] hermanjunge: t|f: around line 194 of dns.js
[22:03] t|f: hermanjunge: Thanks!
[22:03] hermanjunge: Conclusion, make oneself sure that one's entering a good domain name

[22:05] anno^da: xerox: So this one should work? - https://gist.github.com/f9354e98859064a39bba - I'm not running into a timeout even after more than 2 minutes.
[22:05] Bwen has joined the channel
[22:06] xerox: let's see
[22:06] hermanjunge: Now for the n00b question, Where's the docs of the http module?
[22:07] hermanjunge: I'm trying to learn how to make requests inside my code
[22:07] bnoordhuis: t|f hermanjunge: is this about that thread on the mailing list?
[22:07] xerox: anno^da: you have to add the timeout handler on the request
[22:07] hermanjunge: bnoordhuis: yes
[22:07] xerox: not on the http object
[22:07] bnoordhuis: hermanjunge: http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/all.html
[22:07] t|f: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.8/api/http.html
[22:07] bnoordhuis: t|f hermanjunge: i'm 95% sure it's a bug
[22:08] hermanjunge: bnoordhuis: Depends on how you look at it http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs/browse_thread/thread/8d23735bb6d2bae0?hl=en&pli=1
[22:09] t|f: bnoordhuis: Mine is resolved. My code works with master (0.5.0-pre).
[22:09] anno^da: xerox: doesn't the "https.get(...)" method allow chaining so that I am getting back the request object ?
[22:09] Skola: mt3ck_ one more question if you're still there
[22:09] hermanjunge: You are giving to the method a malformatted domain, the method throws an exception, I think That could be a right behaviour
[22:09] Skola: did it load the content?
[22:09] mt3ck_: sure whats up
[22:09] mt3ck_: yea
[22:09] Skola: with the article etc?
[22:10] xerox: anno^da: yes the wrong object
[22:10] Skola: for my gf it apparantly doesn't load half the time
[22:10] xerox: res is the one you want to chain on
[22:10] mt3ck_: redir to vim for node
[22:10] xerox: on data, on timeout, ...
[22:10] Skola: ye that's supposed to happen

[22:11] Skola: 1 last request
[22:11] Skola: could you reload the page a couple of times?
[22:11] Skola: to see if it consistently loads the page correctly?
[22:11] mt3ck_: if i have too :p
[22:11] Skola: I will write proper tests, but just for now :p
[22:11] telemachus: bogomips2_: I don't think that there's a right or wrong. express gives you a lot of convenience functions that you would have to do yourself with raw http or even connect
[22:12] mt3ck_: yea its looking good
[22:12] Skola: ok cheers
[22:12] Skola: will leave you alone now :D
[22:12] mt3ck_: =p
[22:12] xerox: anno^da: also you want to put the console.log inside the .on('data', ...), not outside

[22:17] dall: hey guys 
[22:17] dall: i'm using socket.io and nodejs
[22:17] telemachus: bogomips2_: Like any other client-side javascript. You can store it locally and require it from there or there's also a CDN somewhere
[22:17] dall: the server seems looping
[22:17] tyler-iphone has joined the channel
[22:17] dall: infinite loop
[22:17] dall: :(
[22:18] anno^da: xerox: Hmm ok. My problem is that I am executing the https.get request and the callback function never gets fired. (which would give me the "res"). So why should the timeout ever get fired. Or am I getting something completely wrong.
[22:18] bogomips2_: telemachus, yes ;) my question is.. the file... where is ? i have installed socket.io via npm in the directory is the file called client.js ?
[22:19] xerox: anno^da: the latter
[22:19] telemachus: Found the CDN: http://cdn.socket.io/stable/socket.io.js
[22:19] bogomips2_: ahh thanks :D

[22:20] rfay has joined the channel
[22:20] anno^da: xerox: Hmpf ok. So what would be the correct way of executing the https.get and receiving a timeout event. (the https.get callback never gets fired)
[22:20] telemachus: Skola: Slowly, but surely. I don't think he'll make it for Father's Day.
[22:20] telemachus: :)
[22:21] philtor has joined the channel
[22:21] xerox: anno^da: that is weird
[22:22] telemachus: bogomips2_: And, no, I think the socket.io client library is distinct from the server lib you have from npm - not 100% sure of it, but I think so
[22:23] bogomips2_: ahh ok thanks i have included your link in my page to do some test
[22:23] anno^da: xerox: Yeah I am executing the request pasted in the gist. Yesterday everything went fine and I got the callback. Today without changing anything the callback doesn't get fired. I assumed that the mtgox api just ignores my request ( I don't really know why).
[22:24] xerox: anno^da: hmmm
[22:25] xerox: brb
[22:25] Emmanuel__ has joined the channel
[22:25] telemachus: bogomips2_: No, I'm wrong, it's the socket.io.js file - you can include that from the npm install. See the examples here: https://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO-node
[22:25] telemachus: But again, the CDN will work, too

[22:29] telemachus: Yup
[22:29] xerox: back
[22:29] telemachus: Take a look here, for example: http://davidwalsh.name/websocket
[22:30] telemachus: (Some of that code may be a bit out of date, but the general idea should be fine.)
[22:30] bogomips2_: david walsh use <script src="http://cdn.socket.io/stable/socket.io.js"></script>
