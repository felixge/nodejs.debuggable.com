[00:00] ixti: as far as I can understand, run... creates new process which runs script, so inside that scope, `Object`'s prototype is not modified, while we can pass some sandbox...
[00:00] bingomanatee: I wouldn't expect your modifications of the global space to spill over into the virgin virtual machine. 
[00:00] brownies: so i'm kind of a noob, but i've managed to install node.js, mongodb, npm, etc
[00:00] rudolfrck has joined the channel
[00:00] ixti: so in fact this just confuses
[00:00] brownies: now i have to pick a framework? so i'm looking at express and geddy? what else should i look at?
[00:00] brownies: and how do i go about picking a framework?
[00:00] timmywil has joined the channel
[00:01] bingomanatee: the thing is vm, short for virtual machine, as far as I can tell, runs another instance of node which has not been infected by your local changes. That is exactly what I WOULD expect. 
[00:02] Nexxy: brownies, express
[00:02] brownies: Nexxy: ok. i was leaning towards that too. but why?
[00:02] mcantelon: brownies: Well-supported, lots of cool add ons.
[00:02] Bwen: bingomanatee: I dont think vm.runInNewContext is node.. its just v8 javascript I think
[00:02] Nexxy: I can't really give you an objective answer, but express seems to be the popular choice... so you're most likely going to be more apt to get help
[00:02] Nexxy: and it's sexy as hell
[00:02] bingomanatee: I would not look past express at least until you have tried it - for the brute force reason that the herd loves it and you can always get help from TJ
[00:02] SubStack: when I think "framework" I think of a bunch of crappy generated code or "scaffolding" like rails does[3~
[00:03] brownies: got it
[00:03] SubStack: express is far more a library than a framework
[00:03] Nexxy: qft
[00:03] brownies: so i can just do "npm install express" right? sorry if these are noob questions... but the express website doesn't have an "install" section =/
[00:03] SubStack: which is a good thingâ„¢, I contend
[00:03] Nexxy: brownies, correct
[00:03] mcantelon: brownies: Yup, that should work. :)
[00:03] brownies: ACTION discovers the "Guide" button on the express site
[00:03] Nexxy: SubStack, oki martha
[00:03] bingomanatee: Someone has a bare-bones starter framework bootstrapper for express with MVC 
[00:03] bingomanatee: as do I, for that matter
[00:03] Nexxy: also brownies don't feel alone if the guide leaves you with a lot of questions
[00:04] Nexxy: documentation is not the author's strong point ;P
[00:04] brownies: and, since i have you guys, which mongodb driver should i install? i've got mongodb running
[00:04] SubStack: the nice thing about express is there's very little to learn
[00:04] Nexxy: I like mongoose, but mongodb native seems to be popular as well
[00:04] bingomanatee: https://github.com/cliftonc/express-mvc-bootstrap looks a little more evolved than my stack 
[00:04] mcantelon: brownies: If you're checking out express a great reference app is https://github.com/visionmedia/finance
[00:04] ixti: bingomanatee: yes. I see this same way
[00:04] ixti: but still, that's not very clean :)) probably there should be _bold_ warning about such thing in documentation.
[00:04] brownies: perfect, thanks, mcantelon... i can usually figure things out if i have a good sample
[00:05] ixti: bingomanatee: yes. I completely understand your point.
[00:05] bingomanatee: Keep in mind that Mongoose will insist on a consistent schema which may be good - depending on what you want to do - but it doesn't give you the polymorphic freedom of raw JSON/BSON. 
[00:05] brownies: the backstory is that i have a shoddy node.js app delivered by a contractor who didn't use a framework... i'm hoping i can rewrite it this afternoon
[00:05] vorlov has left the channel
[00:05] bingomanatee: Native, and my bare bones model which wraps native, won't peg you in like that. 
[00:05] Nexxy: brownies, good luck!
[00:05] Prism has joined the channel
[00:06] Nexxy: also, mongoose does allow you to fall back to unmodeled mongo
[00:06] bingomanatee: brownies - do you have to make a lot of forms?
[00:06] Nexxy: but the emphasis is definitely toward using models
[00:06] brownies: bingomanatee: no, just a login/register form
[00:06] bingomanatee: NM.
[00:06] brownies: let me see what he used as far as writing to the db
[00:06] brownies: i'm hoping i can at least salvage some of this code
[00:06] bingomanatee: then I would look into express-mvc-bootstrap. If for nothing else, the script / ed system should save you some time. 
[00:06] bingomanatee: Or you could use Drupal :D
[00:06] Nexxy: ACTION cringes
[00:06] ixti: but hold on one second :)) we can pass require into this virtual machine. so one can try to "require" his modifications from the script and will fail, as require corresponds to the main process and there's no way to pass normal require which will give ability to require extension inside script
[00:06] brownies: yea he's just writing straight JSON

[00:07] Nexxy: ya kinda like that
[00:08] bingomanatee: Drupal is easy money man. 
[00:09] bingomanatee: You can put up a site in three days, then come back in a month and spend three months scaling the project. 
[00:09] bingomanatee: Its better than meth. 
[00:09] mcantelon: bingomanatee: Yeah, it's like the new Rails.
[00:09] SubStack: damn ixti left
[00:09] SubStack: was about to say that works just fine

[00:10] rworth has joined the channel
[00:11] bingomanatee: Rails has made some positive contributions to coding: it has helped to standardize REST. 
[00:11] bingomanatee: And popularize it. 
[00:11] Nexxy: LOL
[00:11] Nexxy: it has helped to standardize REST-like APIs that really don't adhere to REST at all
[00:11] bingomanatee: But I don't think these guys use Rails anyway. 
[00:12] zzak: id rather work in rails than drupal
[00:12] jesusabdullah: Yeah?
[00:12] SubStack: REST is the atheism of standards anyhow
[00:12] zzak: if i had to choose anyways
[00:12] SubStack: the whole point is to avoid abominations like SOAP
[00:12] bingomanatee: ACTION is planning to implement Drupal in Ruby. 
[00:12] bingomanatee: I'm going to call it d-rails :D
[00:12] jesusabdullah: Hard call for me. XD
[00:13] Nexxy: when you see APIs that require you to post *everything* to the same URI, and make up their own verbs
[00:13] Nexxy: that goes beyond agnosticism
[00:13] jesusabdullah: haha, that sounds awesomely annoying!
[00:13] Nexxy: and sadly quite common place
[00:13] Nexxy: BUT IT LOOKS LIKE REST!
[00:13] SubStack: I hate it when people try to use REST for inherently stateful transactions
[00:14] Nexxy: you can REST anything with enough auth tokens!!
[00:14] Nexxy: ;>
[00:14] SubStack: but you shouldn't...
[00:14] Nexxy: ok but you can ;<
[00:14] bingomanatee: Substack: isn't that the definition of Couch? :D
[00:14] jesusabdullah: SubStack: You just don't have enough auth tokens, I bet >:o
[00:15] brownies: heh. i built my entire API around POST! that makes it REST, right? XD
[00:15] Nexxy: ^ %#@$% this
[00:15] jesusabdullah: AWW YEA
[00:15] jesusabdullah: lol

[00:24] Nexxy: I wish i had a choice
[00:24] jesusabdullah: I hear rails is good for that kinda thing actually!
[00:24] bingomanatee: well yes - bad example - 
[00:24] Nexxy: yeah but good luck finding a rails developer that isn't so full of himself he expects a private yacht

[00:28] jesusabdullah: Nexxy: You're right, of course! But we're all obviously post-pst-ironically acting that way.
[00:28] SubStack: those get in the way of all the stuff I need to build
[00:28] bingomanatee: thought you'd say that. 
[00:28] Nexxy: Tidwell, like the Gtk that renders in HTML?
[00:28] bingomanatee: :D 
[00:28] zzak: nexxy: i think you'd be suprised at how many ruby/python devs have taken to ruby and communitys have sorta merged
[00:28] jesusabdullah: Whereas the rails guys are only doing it post-ironically.

[00:29] jesusabdullah: Marak: Node.js muthafuckaaa
[00:29] Nexxy: jesusabdullah, is it the lack of incessant "end end end end end" ?
[00:29] zzak: bingomanatee: therubyracer
[00:30] jesusabdullah: Nexxy: lol! Actually, I usually like the whitespace thing.
[00:30] Nexxy: ACTION can't stand it
[00:30] jesusabdullah: Sometimes indenting patterns are non-obvious though
[00:30] Nexxy: it always ends up in an argument over tabs or spaces
[00:30] SubStack: bingomanatee: https://github.com/substack/dnode-ruby
[00:30] jesusabdullah: ahah, no, there's a PEP for that
[00:30] bingomanatee: uhhhh... sorry I am too busy adding methods to Object.prototype to look at therubyracer. 
[00:31] zzak: lol
[00:31] SubStack: I don't mind whitespace so much although I do like terminating block tokens
[00:31] Nexxy: my g/f writes a lot of python and she adds commented ends to her blocks
[00:31] SubStack: } or 'end' or whatevs it's not very important what it is
[00:31] Nexxy: I think it's a sensible solution
[00:31] SubStack: well now THAT is a bit silly
[00:31] Nexxy: visually it makes sense
[00:31] Nexxy: I hate seeing code just fall off
[00:32] Nexxy: like it's jumping off a cliff
[00:32] SubStack: hmmm perhaps
[00:32] bingomanatee: I actually like the way that VB forces you to annotate block ends. 
[00:32] bingomanatee: I know it is verbose but it its readable.
[00:32] Nexxy: plus! the comments pad your LOC
[00:32] Nexxy: and make you look more productive!!

[00:53] marcello3d: ACTION goes and finds headphones
[00:53] Nexxy: attaboy
[00:53] mcantelon: marcello3d: Hint: it rhymes with "soups".
[00:53] paul: question for the community from a newbie:
[00:53] marcello3d: oh man
[00:53] marcello3d: is that the rails guy?
[00:53] marcello3d: he has the most obnoxious voice
[00:54] Nexxy: you said it not me
[00:54] paul: i'm looking for a good intro to node for someone who already knows that you can pass functions as data
[00:54] marcello3d: I recognize him from his voice
[00:54] paul: recommendations?
[00:54] brownies: what template rendering engine should i use?
[00:54] Nexxy: paul, nodeguide maybe?
[00:54] Nexxy: brownies, I <3 ejs
[00:54] mcantelon: paul: Have you seen howtonode.org ?
[00:54] SubStack: paul: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.6/api/all.html
[00:54] mcantelon: paul: Some good stuff.
[00:55] brownies: i think my dumb contractor used minimal.render? is that a thing?
[00:55] paul: ok thanks
[00:55] brownies: minimal.template, rather.
[00:55] Nexxy: but jade is popular too if you like haml style templates
[00:55] paul: ive seen howtonode but didn't see a bird's-eye-view doc, which is what i'm looking for
[00:55] brownies: i don't know what haml is... should i learn that too? =/
[00:55] Nexxy: no!
[00:55] zzak: oops i hit the lottery
[00:55] Nexxy: save yourself
[00:55] paul: i'll dig a little deeper...
[00:55] brownies: ok. ejs it is.
[00:55] marcello3d: paul: http://nodejs.org/ has a good birdss eye view :)
[00:55] bingomanatee: brownies: ejs lets you type real HTML - everything else abstracts it. 
[00:55] Nexxy: brownies, specifically tj's implementation
[00:56] Nexxy: if you're using express
[00:56] brownies: npm install ejs?
[00:56] Nexxy: it's compliant and very easy to integrate
[00:56] bingomanatee: (TJS? :D) 
[00:56] Nexxy: ilol'd
[00:56] Nexxy: brownies, ya, then just give your templates .ejs file extension
[00:56] marcello3d: ejs is just php right?
[00:56] hij1nx has joined the channel
[00:56] brownies: cool, i'm (slowly) getting the hang of this
[00:56] brownies: O.O but i hate php!
[00:56] marcello3d: ie terrible templating? :D
[00:56] Nexxy: no
[00:56] Nexxy: it's embedded javascript
[00:57] marcello3d: yea
[00:57] w3dot0 has joined the channel
[00:57] marcello3d: like jsp
[00:57] marcello3d: and php
[00:57] marcello3d: and asp
[00:57] Nexxy: the tags just resemble php's (by default)
[00:57] Nexxy: butyou can override the opener/closers
[00:57] Nexxy: and do mustache style tags if yuo want
[00:57] marcello3d: you can do that on php, too
[00:57] zzak: i like how dhh uses mysql to add new columns, instead of migrations
[00:57] marcello3d: it still has the same fundamental flaws
[00:57] zzak: that videos like the original screencast tho
[00:57] Nexxy: explain?
[00:58] Nexxy: maybe I'm missing a flaw ;o
[00:58] marcello3d: mixing logic and layout
[00:58] Nexxy: well yeah but I just choose not to use it
[00:58] Nexxy: kind of another one of those "just because you can..." situations
[00:58] marcello3d: yea, but it encourages it :)
[00:58] marcello3d: I'm using jade cause it compresses well, and I can do AST manipulations pretty easily
[00:59] marcello3d: it forces you to think about your layout more semantically, rather than as html spew
[00:59] Nexxy: but it looks like haml ;|
[00:59] marcello3d: haml/jade whatever
[01:00] bradleymeck: html spew thats a new one
[01:00] marcello3d: it also ensures legal html
[01:00] brownies: did i start a flame war?
[01:00] Nexxy: yep!
[01:00] brownies: i just need a noob-friendly answer
[01:00] Nexxy: brownies, either or
[01:00] Nexxy: pick something compliant with express and you're fine
[01:00] Nexxy: jade, ejs, or jqtpl?
[01:00] brownies: i just read the view-rendering code my contractor wrote... it's so mind-blowingly stupid.
[01:00] marcello3d: brownies: ejs is probably the easiest to pick up if you're coming from php/static html
[01:01] brownies: i'm coming from django/cheetah fwiw
[01:01] marcello3d: I wouldn't necessarily recommend someone starting with something like haml/jade
[01:01] brownies: yea, ejs sounds the least painful. got it.
[01:01] pr2012: In express, if one wanted a rendered partial as a string, can one do that without the res?
[01:01] brownies: i have enough of a mess cleaning up this guy's backend code. i'd like view-rendering to be straightforward for now. =/
[01:01] marcello3d: they're more suited once you realize you need them
[01:02] bingomanatee: pr2012 - you can use EJS directly
[01:02] bingomanatee: or any other templating language for that matter. 
[01:04] bingomanatee: Hell is other people's codebases
[01:05] bingomanatee: Also if you haven't discovered jQuery templates they are pretty sweet ....

[01:18] marcello3d: brownies: look up "layout"
[01:18] bingomanatee: Yes , well, P A R T I A L S!
[01:18] marcello3d: it lets you define a template that wraps around your pages
[01:18] whozman has joined the channel
[01:18] marcello3d: partials are different, no?
[01:18] bingomanatee: oh yeah esp. if you are using express - layouts will provide consistent structure around your content.
[01:19] bingomanatee: partials are different but layouts are the way to go for sitewide structures. 
[01:19] whozman has joined the channel
[01:19] peterwmwong has joined the channel
[01:19] bingomanatee: Layouts encase your content - partials allow you to embed consistent elements - they are different use cases of the same general activity
[01:20] bingomanatee: thx marcello
[01:20] brownies: ok so i just make a file called layout.ejs in my views folder and it will have access to a body variable which i should render with unescaped HTML?
[01:20] brownies: in the docs he just spontaneously starts talking about layout
[01:21] marcello3d: brownies: the docs are a bit scattered
[01:21] bingomanatee: look at https://github.com/bingomanatee/MVC for one implementation of layouts. 
[01:22] bingomanatee: note that using layouts with express requires some configuration
[01:22] brownies: is this with EJS?
[01:22] brownies: ACTION sighs
[01:23] whozman: anyone know if the stuff that TJ wrote about some time ago about :model jade filter works? I am getting undefined filter.

[01:25] justinTNT: I don't like templates. http://blog.nodejitsu.com/micro-templates-are-dead
[01:27] bingomanatee: Hey Tjholowaychuk - you don't have to do anything other than include layout.html in your views folder for the layout to kick in do you?
[01:28] Nexxy: bingomanatee, tj isn't here...
[01:28] Nexxy: but .html won't work unless you specifically specify the extension
[01:28] Nexxy: it expects your template files to have the extension of the engine you're using
[01:29] Nexxy: .jade, .ejs, etc
[01:30] brownies: Nexxy: YES!!! i rendered a template in response to a URL!!!
[01:30] Nexxy: brownies, high five!!
[01:30] Nexxy: pretty easy, ya?
[01:31] brownies: surprisingly easy, considering i don't actually know javascript and i'm just reading lots of example code to make up for that
[01:31] Nexxy: ;3
[01:31] Nexxy: well you're doing great
[01:31] bingomanatee: nice yeah all I did was (parton the spam)     app.set('views', MVC_ROOT + '/views');
[01:31] bingomanatee:     app.register('.html', require('ejs'));
[01:31] bingomanatee:     app.set('view engine', 'html');
[01:31] bingomanatee: and my layouts kicked in on their own.
[01:31] marcello3d: justinTNT: is that actually easier/faster to develop than templates?
[01:31] Nexxy: ooh neat
[01:32] xiagox has joined the channel
[01:32] justinTNT: marcello: works for me. I'm not using that library, but that philosophy, and I haven't hit a wall yet.
[01:32] marcello3d: which lib?
[01:32] bingomanatee: so layout.html (given the above context) will magically wrap your content in its layoutish goodness.
[01:34] newy_ has joined the channel
[01:34] justinTNT: no lib : I pulled the guts from weld to make it play nicely, and extended it to address element attributes. honestly it just comes down to a few lines of code. one day I'll re-engineer it as an express view ...
[01:35] Nexxy: bingomanatee, don't forget the mysterious & magical <%- body %> in layout.html
[01:35] Nexxy: it took me a while to figure that out
[01:35] bingomanatee: justinTNT you are clotting the internet with JSDOM. jQuery Templates are much more effective than server side templating. 
[01:35] marcello3d: bingomanatee: but then you have to use jquery ;D
[01:35] brownies: \o/ ... just figured out how to route for static files, so i've already recreated all the static stuff
[01:36] Nexxy: brownies, you're a natural
[01:36] brownies: i'm starting to like node.js
[01:36] brownies: i didn't like it before, when my contractor wrote an app that crashed 1000 times/day

[01:39] brownies: what's the right way to go about authentication, sessions/cookies, that whole business?
[01:39] Aria: Depends. Who are you authenticating, and what sort of session?
[01:40] newy_ has joined the channel

[01:41] Aria: Long persistent? high security? casual?

[01:41] Aria: Browser-session? Two-week?
[01:41] brownies: the current version (not done in express) uses sessions, but i'd prefer to do a 2-week cookie or something. it's just a casual web app.

[03:57] davemo has joined the channel
[03:58] Owner_: i mean something like sending code from one to the other to execute
[03:58] mscdex: fakewaffle: it parses fine for me using readFile that way...
[03:58] Nexxy: indeed!
[03:58] Owner_: i guess apart from how to can normally do that using a server in a different language
[03:58] Owner_: something other than just outputing scripts
[03:58] Owner_: lol
[03:58] mscdex: fakewaffle: what does 'data' look like that you're emitting for the 'read' event?

[04:00] isaacs: stagas: need to make the side-friction much greater than the backward-friction
[04:00] mscdex: weird
[04:00] stagas: isaacs: yeah I suck at physics :)
[04:00] fakewaffle: yeah, i'm having a hard time understanding what is going on
[04:00] stagas: isaacs: it's a demo to show how easy it is to create synced physics worlds in maga https://github.com/stagas/maga
[04:01] isaacs: stagas: s/cars.html/spaceships.html/ and you've fixed the bug ;)
[04:01] mscdex: fakewaffle: well, next thing to check is what happens in your 'read' event handler?
[04:01] stagas: they just drift on ice
[04:01] stagas: :P
[04:02] brownies: how should i go about form validation?
[04:02] brownies: i can handle form submission, but i'd like to check if, for example, a field is a valid email address
[04:03] fakewaffle: mscdex: i just did it again and it worked fine?!
[04:03] mscdex: heh
[04:03] fakewaffle: mscdex: i'm glad you said it worked for you lol
[04:03] stagas: I mean you just define your physics objects it's as simple as that and everyone is synced, client rewind/prediction and all that handled automagically
[04:03] iFire has joined the channel

[04:08] Nexxy: that's a tough choice?
[04:09] Draggor: fakewaffle: indeed
[04:09] fakewaffle: what color deck do you play?
[04:09] Nexxy: oh god
[04:09] Draggor: fakewaffle: yes?
[04:09] Nexxy: ACTION walks away
[04:10] Draggor: ACTION uses the no money required cube drafting approach.
[04:11] Owner_: is that like nasar drafting?
[04:11] Owner_: nascar*
[04:12] Draggor: Heh, no.  I actually have a drafting program in node laying in shambles on an old machine, I should dig that up and github it.
[04:12] Draggor: It's where you pick a card from a pack, pass the pack to the next person, keep going until all cards are picked, build deck, play.
[04:12] Owner_: nice
[04:12] Owner_: no one keeps any at the end?
[04:12] halfhalo: ACTION hearts his wither deck
[04:13] Draggor: Well for the cube format, instead of opening booster packs and keeping what you pull, one person provides a hand selected colleciton of 360 cards, shuffle them into packs, and draft that way
[04:13] Draggor: all the cards go back to the cube owner at the end
[04:13] Draggor: You get far more variety and consistency in the packs, and it actually allows for different deck strategies
[04:13] bene has joined the channel
[04:14] Draggor: whereas in boosters, there's rather well defined things you have to do based on the card pool.
[04:14] halfhalo: last time I did a draft I ended up with a planeswalker, but no land to use it
[04:15] Draggor: I greatly dislike constructed, it's only about who has the most money
[04:15] Draggor: and in casual, it's about whoever happens to have the deck that's most resistant and/or pulls off a combo first
[04:15] Draggor: With cube drafting, you actually get at the heart of the game
[04:16] Draggor: What I want is to finish my node proggy to let people play online
[04:16] halfhalo: I generally do casual
[04:16] Draggor: though i was just learning node when I made it, so there's a lot of poor design choices to it
[04:16] halfhalo: Heh, my friends usually do elves and get decimated by wither
[04:17] Draggor: constructed is just a series of "deck x beats y, y beats z, z beats x, hope you get lucky in your matchups"
[04:17] Draggor: EDH is better about it
[04:18] stagas: ok did some docs finally https://github.com/stagas/maga/blob/master/README.md
[04:19] halfhalo: gah, I havent played in months...
[04:19] Draggor: Most of the people I know have gotten over their dominion addiction

[04:54] fakewaffle: haha yeah
[04:55] fakewaffle: res.render('page', { layout: 'mylayout.jade' }); does this use page.jade, and passes that to mylayout.jade?
[04:56] mscdex: i'd guess so
[04:56] mscdex: i haven't had a chance to use express yet
[04:57] fakewaffle: i assume it would wrap page.jade in mylayout.jade?
[04:57] fakewaffle: not sure what i need to put in mylayout.jade to do that?
[04:58] xeodox: How come in my mongo database, the date is displayed as "ISODate("2011-05-01T04:50:06.753Z")"...but when I render it to the template (ejs), it's displayed as Sat Apr 30 2011 21:53:27 GMT-0700 (PDT).
[04:58] xeodox: I want it to be displayed as ISODate("2011-05-01T04:50:06.753Z") ...because then my javascript can parse it and make it "5 hours ago..."

[06:24] mjr_: at least you are detecting it now
[06:25] stagas: it's automatic, all inherited objects have access to this.channel.objects and they you can do collision check in your function
[06:25] stride: clientside?
[06:25] stagas: runs anywhere
[06:25] stagas: pure js

[08:39] chjj: yeah, i think "in" is slower than a regular prop lookup
[08:39] chjj: becuase it has to check the prototype
[08:39] chjj: and you have to create a string literal

[08:42] konobi: autovivivication 
[08:43] mraleph: micheil: usually new Foo() is pretty fast â€” you allocate some space in the new space (directly in special stub), then jump to constructor. if memory allocation in new space fails you have to go through runtime and then back to costructor. this is the main overhead, but it happens rarely.
[08:43] mraleph: micheil: why do you ask?

[08:46] chjj: what did you do this time?
[08:46] konobi: xeodox: sys.inspect(req)

[08:48] xeodox: chjj: works thanks
[08:48] xeodox: so silly
[08:49] chjj: req.params is for the params in the route expression, req.query is for the query string, req.body is for the request body, and req.param() is for all of them
[08:49] xeodox: req.body.blah vs req.param('blah')
[08:49] xeodox: different syntax...
[08:49] xeodox: im gonna use req.param() from now on

[09:09] mraleph: micheil: unless you get gazillion messages it should not be expensive. but of course reusing objects can be a good ideaâ€¦ or premature optimization. :-)
[09:11] raynos has joined the channel
[09:12] aho: micheil, you can create over a million objects per second with v8
[09:12] aho: don't worry about it unless it's some big fat and heavy object
[09:12] TomY has joined the channel
[09:12] aho: (or one which is expensive to setup)
[09:13] chjj: yeah, i would add the worst thing ive ever done was underestimate how performant v8 is
[09:13] aho: you can always make your code uglier at a later point :>
[09:13] deanlandolt has joined the channel
[09:14] aho: v8 also got a generational gc. short-lived objects won't hurt much. they are quickly created and quickly discarded

[09:20] chjj: haha, yeah
[09:20] chjj: i still feel suspicious though, knowing things are happening behind the scenes
[09:21] raynos: chjj: just inject c++ addon to your node so that you have access to malloc and free. Problem solved.
[09:21] chjj: i shouldnt let my paranoia overpower me
[09:21] Apeiron` has joined the channel
[09:22] chjj: and also, like i said above, i shouldnt be underestimating v8
[09:22] jetienne: mraleph: is there a way to be notified when gc is running ? or to profile its usage ? im after something to help me optimize this matter
[09:22] mikl has joined the channel

[09:23] raynos: gbot2: But how does it know about my closures! 
[09:24] chjj: lol
[09:24] raynos: Isn't creating memory leaks with complex closures a really trivial thing to do? or am I underestimating v8 aswell
[09:24] jetienne: relax and code
[09:24] SubStack: ram is cheap
[09:25] chjj: not in some places ;)
[09:25] jetienne: chatting on irc is cheap
[09:25] SubStack: fixing problems after they happen is much easier than before
[09:25] raynos: I'd rather spend a day writing 10 lines of _perfect_ code then hacking a thousand together!
[09:26] Apeiron`: So is here a good place to ask general v8 related questions? Such as what am I doing wrong because I'm an idiot that obviously doesn't understand something? XD
[09:26] mraleph: jetienne: if you want to get notifications you can register a callback through V8::AddGCPrologueCallback
[09:26] jetienne: raynos: beginner mistake
[09:26] chjj: thats actually usually what i do, i spend more time thinking about coding than actually coding sometimes
[09:26] SubStack: Take chances, get messy, make mistakes!
[09:26] mraleph: Apeiron`: yes you ask your v8 related questions here. 
[09:26] raynos: chjj: It's horrible isn't it. You need to hack more.
[09:26] jetienne: mraleph: is that a good metric ? what do you use when you want to check memory isnt going crazy ?
[09:26] chjj: yes
[09:27] chjj: i think im afraid of commitment
[09:27] Xano has joined the channel

[09:27] mraleph: jetienne: generally I am just using â€”trace-gc and â€”trace-gc-nvp. but that is not very useful on long running server
[09:27] jetienne: mraleph: ok thanks
[09:27] raynos: chjj: Have you thought of research/academia instead of coding.
[09:28] SubStack: I like to hack up a bunch of ugly tentative code and then delete most of it
[09:28] chjj: no, i like coding
[09:28] chjj: i just get "coder's block" sometimes :)
[09:28] SubStack: write tests!
[09:28] SubStack: that is a good way to get past being stuck
[09:28] jetienne: about tests, is there a good client/server framework to test ?
[09:29] jetienne: something simple, which works
[09:29] raynos: nodeunit is good enough
[09:29] jetienne: raynos: it works in browser ?
[09:29] raynos: probably.
[09:29] jetienne: ok :)
[09:29] raynos: You can write a tiny test wrapper if you want.
[09:29] Apeiron`: Great, because I've been staring at the screen for the past 10 minutes trying to figure out how a (Handle<ObjectTemplate>)->NewIntance() call is corrupting memory all over the place... http://apeiron.no-ip.org:6112/Apeiron/scripttest.tgz ScriptInterface.cpp:182 is the call in question. Do have a good laugh about the code that I've undoubtedly screwed up rather horribly
[09:29] mraleph: jetienne: if I need to go deeper I just instrument V8 with whatever I need. sometimes built-in profiler might be useful to track live objects. (it will become even more useful as UI revamp will be completed).
[09:29] raynos: I have done. Just implement the CommonJS test api
[09:29] SubStack: jetienne: browserify it!
[09:30] jetienne: SubStack: simple i said :)

[09:31] Apeiron`: Oh, http://apeiron.no-ip.org:6112/Apeiron/scriptest.tgz Brain hit the t twice out of habit
[09:32] raynos: jetienne: node unit claims to work in the browser
[09:32] mohit has joined the channel
[09:32] SubStack: raynos: quite a lot of things work in the browser with browserify
[09:33] mohit: hello. quick starter question.
[09:33] raynos: SubStack: oh that's a code thing rather then a fancy word for hack it to make it work.
[09:33] SubStack: yes
[09:34] mohit: How do i check to see if a file is directly invoked from the command line with node, as opposed to being imported. To selectively run with options when running from command line. 
[09:34] SubStack: it is an automated contraption to turn node modules into browser-compatible bundles of awesome
[09:34] raynos: SubStack: that is neat. But it causes issues. I tend to code to ES5 rather then ES3 in node so most of my node code breaks in old browsers
[09:34] SubStack: raynos: es5 included
[09:34] chjj: mohit: if (!module.parent) should work
[09:34] SubStack: es5-shim that is
[09:34] mraleph: Apeiron`: ot is not Persistent
[09:35] Apeiron`: .. you're joking
[09:35] coreb has joined the channel
[09:35] Apeiron`: ... request permission to swear a lot and get banned for it
[09:35] raynos: SubStack: There's an ES5 shim? It bet it extends Array.prototype though. So my code will break:)
[09:36] SubStack: why would your code break?
[09:36] raynos: Because I like `for..in` on Arrays and just assume no-one extends native prototypes.
[09:37] mohit: chjj: thanks, i was using process.argv array, but knew there had to be a better way. Thanks!
[09:37] chjj: oh, mohit, to look at the command line args you can check `process.argv`
[09:37] chjj: ah
[09:37] Apeiron`: raynos: For arrays, why not make sure the key is an integer and solve that problem entirely?
[09:38] SubStack: raynos: erm, don't do that then?
[09:38] raynos: I tend to have generic functions that use for..in over collections and either pass in objects or arrays as a "collection". I don't do any kind of checking on that. 
[09:38] chjj: raynos: im with you, i use for...in a lot when its safe to assume theres no inherited properties
[09:38] SubStack: xs.forEach() ftw
[09:39] raynos: SubStack: it's perfectly safe! I just can't use any 3rd party libraries that extend natives
[09:39] SubStack: raynos: so then it's not perfectly safe at all
[09:39] raynos: The main issue is generic functions that loop over either arrays or objects and don't care whether the parameter is an array or object
[09:40] Spion_ has joined the channel
[09:40] hackband has joined the channel
[09:40] chjj: yeah, ive used for...in on arrays in certain contexts
[09:40] SubStack: don't do that?
[09:40] SubStack: Object.keys(obj).forEach(fn) works great
[09:41] chjj: slow!
[09:41] chjj: ;p
[09:41] SubStack: or you can require('hashish')
[09:41] SubStack: chjj: premature optimization hogwash
[09:41] raynos: SubStack: the main issue is using for..in on an object but passing in an object that _happens_ to also be an array
[09:41] `3rdEden: mraleph: Are there any performance hits when I dynamically generate the body of a function at runtime? Eg by doing `var parser = new Function('var bla = "stuff"')`
[09:41] chjj: ah, premature optimization, it burns!
[09:41] chjj: hehe
[09:41] chjj: yeah, i know
[09:41] seivan has joined the channel
[09:41] raynos: `3rdEden: yes. and its also eval. it is evil unless your being very clever.
[09:41] chjj: i still use for...in a lot when i dont see a reason not to
[09:42] raynos: I use for in because it's shorter and nicer
[09:42] chjj: yeah
[09:42] chjj: definitely
[09:42] raynos: It's a pain to check for an array and use a manual for loop.
[09:42] `3rdEden: ACTION raynos: I just wonder V8 is optimized for it, I don't care how evil it is.
[09:42] raynos: That's just annoying boilerplate code
[09:42] `3rdEden: oh. irc fail
[09:42] mraleph: `3rdEden: unless you allocate tons of those â€” no. there is basically no difference between normal functions and the ones created with Function constructor
[09:43] raynos: mraleph: doesn't the fact it has to eval the code make it slower? 
[09:43] chjj: well, actually creating the function is slower
[09:43] chjj: but after that
[09:43] chjj: its fine
[09:43] mraleph: raynos: Function constructor is not global eval.
[09:43] raynos: mraleph: and only global eval creates overhead?
[09:43] SubStack: but for...in isn't nicer at all
[09:44] mraleph: raynos: yes. it's because it has this special scoping rules.
[09:44] killfill has joined the channel
[09:44] SubStack: it has obscure error cases
[09:44] `3rdEden: mraleph: Thanks I only need to generate it once when I call the contructor of my function. So it's not called millions of times. I just want to make sure V8 doesn't ditch JIT optimisations
[09:44] SubStack: and it doesn't create a new scope
[09:44] mc_greeny has joined the channel
[09:44] SubStack: which is really annoying if you're writing async node code
[09:44] mraleph: of course you have to pay for allocation and creating function object but after that it's just like any other normal function
[09:45] SubStack: so if you define a listener over a looped parameter the value will be bound to the last loop iteration instead of the present iteration value at the time of binding
[09:45] chjj: if you wrap it in a function it wont
[09:46] mraleph: closure creation is cheaper just because certain objects are preallocated during parse time of the whole script.  
[09:46] SubStack: chjj: but then why not just use forEach() from the start?
[09:46] chjj: i would use forEach in that situation
[09:46] chjj: absolutely
[09:47] chjj: but in places where i can make assumptions about the object, or dont need an array to be iterated over in order, i might not use it
[09:48] chjj: i actually dont really have strong convictions about this
[09:48] chjj: just a minor preference of mine
[09:48] raynos: SubStack: depends on personal preference. if you need a closure use forEach
[09:48] hellp has joined the channel
[09:48] SubStack: also check this, for...in peeps:
[09:49] raynos: Besides most of the time I use _.each anyway.

[09:49] v8bot: SubStack: 58
[09:49] SubStack: for...in: actually slower
[09:49] SubStack: science proves it
[09:49] chjj: let me pull out my old loop benchmark test
[09:50] raynos: for...in is ok if your perfectly aware of the pitfalls. I wouldn't recommend it because the pitfalls are annoying
[09:50] mraleph: well. iterating over Arrays with for in is actually beyond evil
[09:50] chjj: i know >:D
[09:50] Apeiron`: mraleph: Tried making it persistent but it doesn't appear to have helped. Same crash, same place and reason. 0x939588 and 0x939558 are the addresses of the globals map and callbacks multimap up until the call to script->Run() in ScriptInterface::load, however after that, according to the first call out of the script (Console.print()), the addresses are 0x7f7697ade9 and 0x7f7697adb9
[09:50] raynos: Using eval("for (xs in x) { ... }") is even better!
[09:50] SubStack: not that I care especially about saving a few microseconds, just brought that up because somebody mentioned it earlier
[09:51] SubStack: mraleph: yes that's what I'm trying to say
[09:51] SubStack: so many problems
[09:51] SubStack: hell I don't even use for(;;) if I can help it
[09:51] chjj: one thing that actually messed me up once: if you loop over an array using its actual keys, the keys are strings, so if you do key + someString, it might concatenate or it might add
[09:52] chjj: or
[09:52] chjj: other way around
[09:52] chjj: the key might get concatenated with a number =/
[09:53] SubStack: the index is the second parameter to the forEach callback
[09:53] SubStack: if you need it
[09:53] mraleph: Apeiron`: very strange.
[09:53] Apeiron`: You can work around that with a clean parseInt(key)+n or a key - (-n) if you're feeling dirty
[09:53] mraleph: Apeiron`: do you run it with debug version of V8?
[09:53] Apeiron`: Sadly no
[09:54] raynos: or +key + n
[09:54] mraleph: running with debug version might help to find the cause :-)
[09:54] raynos: the + operator converts to a number like that.
[09:54] chjj: yeah, i go with +

[10:03] mraleph: Apeiron`: frankly speaking your code looks overly complicated. for example why do you create so many Contexts? almost in every ScriptInterface's method you do Context::New 
[10:03] mpotra: hello. is there any chance that upon sending client.write( data ), I would receive more than one "data" event on the server (buffer truncating)? What I mean is, does every socket.write equal one "data" event ?
[10:03] mraleph: that's just wasteful
[10:05] nmtmason has joined the channel
[10:06] Apeiron`: Because I'm obviously doing something wrong, mraleph. The idea was that the callbacks would store the handle to their context, but no other contexts were really needed. All of the main setup would be done in createContext() for the load() function to start it off and then just use Context::Callee() after when calls come in from the Javascript side
[10:06] Nexxy: SubStack, where are those microseconds I asked you to save?

[10:07] isaacs has joined the channel
[10:08] SubStack: oh it's isaacs 
[10:08] isaacs: hi
[10:08] Apeiron`: For instance, in the Console.bind() call, the ScriptInterface::setCallback function gets the context from Callee() and saves it with the function handle. When the function is called from C++, that handle is used
[10:08] mraleph: Apeiron`: context does not have Callee method
[10:09] SubStack: hey isaacs it's super annoying that when I list expresso as a devDependency and I `npm link` then npm tries to build the damn thing in ./node_modules
[10:09] Apeiron`: GetCalling()*, sorry
[10:09] SubStack: even though a perfectly good local copy already exists
[10:09] Apeiron`: Long day >_>
[10:09] SubStack: erm, *global copy
[10:09] Apeiron`: Javascript mind, arguments.callee
[10:10] liorkesos has joined the channel
[10:10] mraleph: well GetCalling() and arguments.callee are different things
[10:10] mraleph: GetCalling returns Context of the caller.
[10:10] Apeiron`: I know
[10:10] mraleph: Context is a whole JavaScript world.
[10:10] mraleph: ok
[10:10] isaacs: SubStack: that's a pretty good point.  for the time being, do the cmd with --no-rebuild
[10:11] liorkesos: HiYa, I'm trying to implement a basic proxy parsing some json and returning a limited set of json to the original requester.
[10:11] SubStack: isaacs: npm link --no-rebuild? It still tries to build it
[10:11] isaacs: really?  hm.
[10:11] mraleph: Apeiron`: your code looks self contained. let me try to build and run it
[10:11] SubStack: oh I see why
[10:11] SubStack: the npm upgrade must've nuked expresso
[10:12] isaacs: oh, that could be
[10:12] Apeiron`: I couldn't think of a way to store contexts in an easy way and still be able to just go scriptInterfaceInstance->call('callback name', ...) and it work fine, so I stored a persistent handle to it for every function handle and hoped for the best
[10:12] SubStack: even though I was already running the v1 rc build
[10:12] liorkesos: This is the basic code - http://pastebin.com/fB5taCKL
[10:12] isaacs: SubStack: was express linked in the first place?
[10:12] isaacs: or is it bundled locally?
[10:12] Apeiron`: Yeah, output will be very, very ugly with all the pn %p %p everywhere while I was trying to find where the memory was going wrong
[10:13] liorkesos: trying to do a get on that url and parse the contents.
[10:13] SubStack: isaacs: the expresso binary still works but I can't require('expresso') after the upgrade
[10:13] SubStack: could just be some silly unimportant graceful upgrade issue

[10:51] Apeiron`: Worse than that. In Console::print, c = 0x7fc1a324e091, where it should be 0x1c0faf0 >_<
[10:51] mraleph: Apeiron`: but I can't grok whereâ€¦ because according to some debug printf's you overwrite globals['Console'] in several places. 
[10:51] mraleph: Apeiron`: that's probably address of undefined value
[10:52] mraleph: Apeiron`: if you were using debug v8 it would just catch that.
[10:52] chjj: does npm publish ignore .git by default?
[10:52] Apeiron`: That field is the last thing that's set, so no amount of overwriting from addGlobal should be a problem
[10:52] mraleph: Apeiron`: so my guess would be that your globals mapping and reall globals attached to template come out of sync somewhere
[10:53] mraleph: so you set field on object from globals but from JS you use some different object

[14:52] pyrotechnick2: Sephi-Chan: FYI the fundamental node.js API express utilises to route the requests is request.url
[14:52] MaSch: hi. I'm trying to write a reverse proxy in node. It works great but cloud9 doesn't run behind it. i think thats a issue with websockets. How would you forward/proxy a websocket connection? 
[14:52] pyrotechnick2: Sephi-Chan: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.7/api/http.html#request.url
[14:53] pyrotechnick2: but if you're trying to get things done instead of learn the ins and outs then you're better off with something like express, it will solve many other problems for you
[14:54] Sephi-Chan: pyrotechnick2: Yep i used that but it quickly became a pain to maintain since i want "sexy" URLs
[14:54] justinTNT: masch: what do you mean cloud9 doesnt run behind it? 
[14:54] temp01 has joined the channel
[14:55] mendel_ has joined the channel
[14:55] marcello3d: justinTNT: he probably means when trying to proxy cloud9, it doesn't work
[14:55] MaSch: justinTNT: i use a node process to forward http request to a specific host:port depending on their hostname
[14:56] justinTNT: that process sits on cloud9? what's the failure mode?
[14:57] MaSch: i start a cloud9 instance, listening on port X and start that "proxy" listening on port 80. For "normal" http request everything works fine but cloud9 just answers me this:" Your browser is not supported by ajax.org. Please upgrade your browser to one of these modern browsers."
[14:57] raeb has joined the channel
[14:58] MaSch: in the log of cloud9 there is no "connection from blabla" so i think the problem is that i don't forward the websocket. 
[15:00] mynyml has joined the channel
[15:00] MaSch: so the solution would be to include a socket.io server AND client in the proxy and pipe everything that appears at one of them to the other one

[16:29] Draggor: Bonuspunkt: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.7/api/fs.html#fs.readFile
[16:29] Bonuspunkt: Draggor yes i know but the question was about the easiest way to ensure the result of the sync will be the same as async
[16:30] Draggor: Bonuspunkt: how do you mean?
[16:31] Bonuspunkt: if i just replace the function with function(file) { require('fs').readFile(file, function(err,data) { console.log(data) }); }
[16:31] Bonuspunkt: the order of console.log will not be a,b,c
[16:32] Draggor: Ah, you want to call the next one in the callback of reading "a.txt"
[16:32] Bonuspunkt: no i want to start them "parallel" and give back orderd
[16:32] Draggor: I'm wondering why you need to log them in order if they're not finishing that way?
[16:34] Bonuspunkt: in rl the console.log is ServerResponse.write(fileContext)
[16:34] Draggor: Ahh
[16:34] Draggor: So for this scenario I made a latch function
[16:34] Draggor: right at the top here: https://github.com/draggor/node-ircbot/blob/master/util.js
[16:34] pyrotechnick2 has joined the channel
[16:35] Draggor: So your array would instead have to be functions that will do your async action but be able to take a callback which the latch supplies as each action finishes.  If it's the last one done, your supplied callback will execute
[16:36] Draggor: I guess you could tweak that, and say based on the order, if A is done first, write A, and be and c have to wait if they finish sooner
[16:37] chjj: i just learned the hard way that .removeListener doesnt remove listeners set with .once

[18:15] pyrotechnick2: yes, really
[18:15] tjh: asm doesnt really count either imo
[18:16] pyrotechnick2: people hated writing 1/0 so they decided to bring some of the ENGLISH alphabet in instead

[18:49] ChrisBuchholz: pyrotechnick2: 10.04.1. but with very new npm and node.js (almost newest)
[18:49] pyrotechnick2: you might want to check out upstart
[18:49] pyrotechnick2: we've used it in production before with success

[18:50] tjh: you guys are using three.js right?
[18:51] pyrotechnick2: yes we are

[18:54] tjh: ah
[18:54] pyrotechnick2: now i'm not one for selling out
[18:54] tjh: makes sense, gotta do something you are passionate about too though

[18:56] pyrotechnick2: i think what people need to understand is that you don't have to have a finished gameâ€¦not even ever
[18:56] ChrisBuchholz: anyone using node on ubuntu server? i have ubuntu server 10.04.1 with node 0.4.7 and npm 0.3.18. i wanna use Forever to deploy but it fails in install (actually, daemon, a dependency, fails). anyone using it?
[18:56] pyrotechnick2: take something like minecraft for example, it sucks, it sucked, it still sucks and it always will
[18:56] pyrotechnick2: does that mean it's not successful? god no
[18:56] tjh: haha true

[19:00] pyrotechnick2: im lookin thru them now
[19:01] tjh: I wrote one part for the iphone and realised it's wayyyyy to small
[19:01] tjh: cocos2d is rad though
[19:01] tjh: torque sucks
[19:01] `3rdEden: looks much more do-able for a ipad
[19:01] pyrotechnick2: you can do all this in js now
[19:01] tjh: yeah totally
[19:01] pyrotechnick2: there's plenty of people leading the way
[19:02] tjh: the ipad would have been great for it
[19:02] pyrotechnick2: dont wanna sound too much of a fanboy buy the ngmoco dudes were talking about the engine they wrote for android/iphone that runs pure js
[19:02] pyrotechnick2: backed on the serverside by node and stuff
[19:02] tjh: awesome
[19:02] brownies: hm, so forever is bad to use? what should i use instead of forever?
[19:02] joshontheweb has joined the channel
[19:02] brownies: pyrotechnick2: this is their multiplayer server? they used node for it? that's... insane.
[19:03] pyrotechnick2: he said the only bad thing about node is how many clients they can now get on one server, when it used to go down on ruby or something it was like a few hundred clients, not a big deal, now it's thousands upon thousands, which is quite a big deal
[19:03] onre_ has joined the channel
[19:04] pyrotechnick2: theyre also using erlang and shit though where it makes sense, it's not all pure node but the way he was talking about node and js in general makes me think they want to roll with js/node as much as possible
[19:04] pyrotechnick2: he said the one thing he hates is JS, i was going to suggest CS :p
[19:04] pyrotechnick2: but i have a feeling his quarrel is with the standard library more than anything

[19:10] pyrotechnick2: so we're at the stage now that we're just trying to omit the parts of the game that require 3d physics and go for a more building game than fps/rpg
[19:10] pyrotechnick2: we've kind of established that whilst people enjoy shooting zombies with arrows and riding wolves it's not actually why they keep on playing and paying for minecraft
[19:11] saschagehlich: `3rdEden: haha. :P
[19:11] saschagehlich: come to germany, we have good internetz!

[20:59] n1c: Tried googling around but couldn't really find anything helpful?
[20:59] Bonuspunkt: n1c did u exec ./configure ?

[21:01] mscdex: so you probably have some thing like $HOME/local/node/node now
[21:02] n1c: If I install with apt, will it be rather out of date?
[21:02] jesusabdullah: Yes
[21:03] n1c: :x
[21:03] n1c: ~/local is still empty.
[21:03] mscdex: er wait, nvm

[21:04] jesusabdullah: I just upgraded last night
[21:05] mscdex: n1c: works for me on 10.04
[21:05] mscdex: should be the same on 11.04
[21:05] jesusabdullah: My nodes still work fwiw
[21:05] {aaron}: anybody use the qunit port to node.js?
[21:07] n1c: Yeah I'm on 10.04 locally.
[21:07] n1c: Wouldn't expect that to be a problem.
[21:07] n1c: Yeah jesusabdullah it's the new one.
[21:07] gonsfx: d'oh. my expressjs app redirects to 'localhost:3000' on res.redirect('/') when running live. wth?
[21:07] n1c: What is waf anyway?
[21:08] mscdex: n1c: it's the build system that node uses
[21:08] n1c: Ah.
[21:08] marlun: Which library do you recommend for using sqlite with node?
[21:08] mscdex: n1c: did you check permissions on $HOME/local just to be sure?
[21:09] n1c: Well
[21:09] n1c: afaik, I didn't make the dir myself and it exists
[21:09] mscdex: :S
[21:10] n1c: So I guess the --prefix on configure made it?
[21:10] mscdex: i'd check then
[21:10] mscdex: i dunno if it would or not
[21:10] n1c: What should I check?

[21:14] mscdex: ok
[21:14] mscdex: should be fine then
[21:14] n1c: yeah I figured.
[21:14] n1c: Would it have anything to do with the version of Python installed?
[21:15] n1c: I stumbled onto a stackoverflow post mentioning python version.
[21:15] mscdex: i wouldn't think so, but what version do you have installed?
[21:15] n1c: But it's like 7 months old (the post).
[21:15] n1c: Ah, 2.7.1+

[21:16] {aaron}: is it possible to run non-CommonJS modules in node.js?
[21:17] {aaron}: it looks like globals are not visible
[21:17] Aria: If you wrap them up or edit them to work, yes.
[21:17] {aaron}: :(
[21:17] Aria: Or load them and evaluate them in your context.
[21:17] {aaron}: ah, so require('../path/to/arbitrary.js') ?
[21:17] Aria: That wraps in the node module context.
[21:18] Aria: eval(file.readSync('path/to/arbitrary.js'))
[21:18] Aria: require pastes a function around your code as it's loaded.
[21:18] {aaron}: i see
[21:18] Aria: So true globals work, but things you'd expect to be defined if you loaded with a <script> tag may not be.
[21:18] {aaron}: so would an alternative be using the jsdom package to load an html page? i assume that does the right thing?
[21:19] Aria: Well, yes, ish. 
[21:19] {aaron}: i'll try eval
[21:19] Aria: That loads it in the context of the DOM you create with it.
[21:19] {aaron}: i'm just trying to get started with some trival qunit testing here
[21:19] Aria: But you'll need something like that if your code uses a DOM.
[21:19] ph^ has joined the channel
[21:20] {aaron}: i'm using th equnit package and the cli has this help line: -d, --deps dependency paths - files required before code (space separated)
[21:20] n1c: Ah, mscdex I was being an ass. Think I have it sorted now.
[21:20] {aaron}: since the globals are not visible i'm assuming it's doing something like 'require'
[21:20] mscdex: n1c: what was the problem?
[21:20] CIA-72: node: 03Robert Mustacchi 07master * r9812e31 10/ (6 files in 3 dirs): Add reading/writing of C integers to buffers - http://bit.ly/jGLxTM
[21:20] n1c: With --without-ssl warning?
[21:20] Aria: That would make sense.
[21:20] n1c: I thought it was just a warning. Turns out it halts the configure :)
[21:21] n1c: So I just put in --without-ssl and it seems A.OK now.
[21:21] n1c: Should probably sleep...
[21:21] mscdex: oh yeah
[21:22] mscdex: n1c: you can install libssl-dev to get ssl support :)
[21:22] n1c: Heh, thanks.

[21:25] gonsfx: does anyone know where req.headers.host gets set in expressjs?

[21:25] mscdex: ohio here
[21:26] n1c: Rad
[21:26] eldios: gonsfx, what do you mean?
[21:26] mscdex: a long ways away from node central :P
[21:26] n1c: Hah
[21:26] n1c: I'm from South Africa
[21:26] gonsfx: when redirecting to home by res.redirect('/') on my vhost it redirects to localhost:3000
[21:26] mscdex: even farther!
[21:26] n1c: Yeah I think I'd win the distance prize.
[21:27] gonsfx: and thats because expressjs redirect uses req.headers.host, which is localhost:3000 for whatever reason
[21:27] gonsfx: and now i'm wondering where this property of the req object is set and on what basis
[21:27] demastrie has joined the channel

[21:28] gonsfx: Aria: yep. Could be that.
[21:28] Aria: n1c: Colorado, USA
[21:28] Aria: Yeah. Some proxies keep the original host information intact; some do not.
[21:28] Aria: Apaches does not.
[21:28] bradleymeck has joined the channel
[21:28] Aria: So since you forward to localhost:3000, that's what node thinks it's called.
[21:28] {aaron}: Area, do I need to var file = require('fs'); to use readAsync?
[21:28] gonsfx: Argh. It's apache then.
[21:29] gonsfx: it eats the ip-addresses aswell :)
[21:29] Aria: Yep. Though that's a bit more normal, since proxying is application layer.

[21:38] SubStack: too many failure cases
[21:38] Bonuspunkt: i think node needs something like arbiters at least so they are called at the ccr
[21:38] SubStack: qilf: I hope not.
[21:38] zzak: doesnt hasOwnProperty take care of most of that?
[21:38] SubStack: on the last count at least
[21:38] qilf: I thought Express.js was basically RoR for node.js
[21:39] SubStack: it's more of a sinatra
[21:39] chjj: oh wow, i hope not
[21:39] chjj: yeah, its a sinatra-like framework
[21:39] SubStack: or a werkzeug

[21:41] SubStack: it's not terse anymore
[21:41] chjj: yes, for...in with a hasOwnProperty wrapper
[21:41] chjj: is insanely slow
[21:41] SubStack: doesn't matter
[21:41] SubStack: it looks ugly and it's a lot of typing
[21:41] SubStack: much better reasons
[21:41] SubStack: xs.forEach(), Object.keys(obj).forEach()
[21:41] chjj: that too
[21:42] zzak: hasOwnProperty does seem like it'd be slower because it has to look up the prototype chain for every loop
[21:42] SubStack: or Hash(obj).forEach() with hashish
[21:42] newy_ has joined the channel
[21:42] chjj: yeah, just use Object.keys with a regular for
[21:42] zzak: i dont see how its any more terse than for() that creates many local variables

[21:45] SubStack: much shorter and less ridiculous
[21:46] chjj: i think zzak was talking about the regular for statement with a call to Object.keys?
[21:46] chjj: not forEach
[21:46] stride: that's not enterprise-ready SubStack. needs more abstractions#
[21:46] zzak: whats the forEach implementation?

[21:49] chjj: qilf: thats a shame

[21:50] SubStack: everything is slow for big object
[21:50] markwubben has joined the channel
[21:50] chjj: well, you can do Object.keys(obj).forEach(function(){});
[21:51] zzak: good idea

[21:51] chjj: to get the non-enumerable props

[21:52] zzak: but you could just dup the Object.prototype
[21:52] chjj: its good, short
[21:52] chjj: yeah there were really hesitant about sticking stuff on the prototypes
[21:52] jesusabdullah: I guess there could be cognitive dissonance maybe
[21:53] SubStack: Object !== Object.prototype

[21:54] pandeiro has joined the channel
[21:54] zzak: Object.keys(obj) wouldnt have a problem with the prototype i guess then

[21:54] chjj: yeah it would
[21:55] chjj: wouldve wrecked a lot of scripts
[21:55] chjj: people who were storing "keys" for something else on an object, and checked truth value with if (obj.keys)
[21:55] chjj: that code would just be broken

[21:57] noocx: chjj: thanks
[21:58] zzak: singleton method?
[21:58] chjj: hm?
[21:58] chjj: it returns an array of all the enumerable and non-enumerable property names
[21:58] zzak: how is it not apart of any prototype though?
[21:59] chjj: because its stuck on the Object global object
[21:59] chjj: they were hesistant about putting on Object.prototype
[21:59] chjj: because then every object would appear to have that property
[21:59] chjj: could have caused collisions with legacy code
[22:00] zzak: right, its not an instance method
[22:00] chjj: yes, its a class method or a static method or whatever you want to call it

[22:24] boghog: is there an easy way to encode a string to be passed in the 'path' for a http.get() request?
[22:24] boghog: i.e. spaces get replaced to %20
[22:24] boghog: s/to/with/
[22:24] a|i: why promises were removed from node?
[22:25] mscdex: boghog: encodeURIComponent
[22:25] mscdex: a|i: those were removed a loooong time ago
[22:25] mscdex: over a year ago
[22:25] a|i: mscdex: yes, but why?
[22:26] mscdex: i don't recall the exact reason, but you could probably look back in the mailing list archives
[22:26] a|i: ok.
[22:27] boghog: thanks mscdex, what module is that part of?

[22:36] btipling: I am
[22:36] Sephi-Chan: It's going to drive me crazyâ€¦
[22:36] btipling: I use redis
[22:36] Sephi-Chan: All my command return undefined
[22:37] Sephi-Chan: Any idea ?.
[22:37] btipling: commands are asynchronous
[22:37] btipling: you supply a callback
[22:37] Sephi-Chan: So ?
[22:37] Sephi-Chan: Okk
[22:37] btipling: is there some easy way to track where information was sent to a client with an http server?
[22:37] CarlosEDP has joined the channel
[22:37] Nexxy: node-inspector?
[22:37] btipling: would help with "Can't set headers after they are sent."  errors
[22:38] Sephi-Chan: So it explains why my set actions workâ€¦ (hset for instance)
[22:38] btipling: uh does it return something other than undefined?
[22:38] btipling: it does the action, even the get do the action
[22:38] Sephi-Chan: Hmâ€¦ No xD
[22:39] btipling: just if you want the result supply a callback
[22:39] Sephi-Chan: Yes it's right :p
[22:39] btipling: you're using node_redis yeah?
[22:39] btipling: it's in the readme
[22:39] btipling: https://github.com/mranney/node_redis
[22:39] Sephi-Chan: Yepâ€¦ :/
[22:39] btipling: "Each Redis command is exposed as a function on the client object. All functions take either take either an args Array plus optional callback Function or a variable number of individual arguments followed by an optional callback. Here is an example of passing an array of arguments and a callback:"
[22:40] Sephi-Chan: Really not used to this asyn style ^^
[22:40] btipling: Nexxy: will checkout node-inspector
[22:40] Sephi-Chan: Andâ€¦ need some sleep ^^
[22:40] btipling: Sephi-Chan: get used to it, that's the JavaScript way
[22:40] Sephi-Chan: Thanks a lot btipling ! :)
[22:40] btipling: np
[22:40] Nexxy: ;3 it's very nice
[22:40] Nexxy: one thing I had a little trouble with though
[22:40] hellp has joined the channel
[22:40] Nexxy: make sure you install node-inspector with the -g flag
[22:40] Nexxy: or it will be rather awkward to launch it
[22:40] btipling: can't I just use npm
[22:41] Nexxy: ya
[22:41] Nexxy: npm -g install node-inspector
[22:41] btipling: what does the -g do?
[22:41] Nexxy: installs it globally
[22:41] Nexxy: so you can just run it w/ "node-inspector &"
[22:41] nvidhive has joined the channel
[22:41] Nexxy: otherwise it will end up in your node_modules directory
[22:42] btipling: I use sudo to install npm packages
[22:42] Nexxy: O_o
[22:42] btipling: everything usually ends up in the path
[22:42] Nexxy: don't...
[22:42] Nexxy: lol
[22:42] btipling: uh it's fine
[22:42] Nexxy: it's not necessary
[22:42] btipling: wfm
[22:42] Nexxy: unnecessarily opening up your system to arbitrary scripts
[22:42] kixxauth has joined the channel
[22:42] Nexxy: not a great idea
[22:42] btipling: it's fine
[22:42] btipling: since a recent version
[22:42] boaz has joined the channel
[22:43] Nexxy: I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on that one ;3
[22:43] btipling: you're just wrong though :\
[22:43] Nexxy: care to explain?
[22:43] btipling: it installs packages as non root level user
[22:43] btipling: when you use sudo
[22:43] btipling: or something like that
[22:43] Nexxy: ah huh...
[22:44] btipling: the sudo warning is gone
[22:44] btipling: you should upgrade if you still get it
[22:44] Nexxy: ...
[22:44] Nexxy: I don't get it because I don't use sudo
[22:44] Nexxy: lol
[22:44] Nexxy: that's my point
[22:44] Nexxy: there's no reason to use sudo
[22:45] btipling: like I said wfm
[22:45] stevenj: how does sudo not use root?
[22:46] btipling: there are incorrect assumptions in your question
[22:46] btipling: sudo does use root
[22:46] btipling: the npm installer changes user for packages or someshit
[22:46] btipling: someone explained it to me recently
[22:47] stevenj: to what user
[22:47] btipling: I'm probably not the person to ask for more specifics
[22:47] stevenj: why use sudo in the first place then?
[22:47] Nexxy: ^
[22:47] Nexxy: maybe he's using some fancy package I've never heard of
[22:47] Nexxy: but none of the packages I've installed have needed to run w/ sudo
[22:47] Nexxy: globally or locally
[22:48] Nexxy: so I must just be clueless ;3

[22:48] btipling: that wasn't patronizing

[22:48] btipling: it's just more convenient
[22:48] btipling: I don't have to worry about -g flag for example
[22:48] Nexxy: ...
[22:49] Nexxy: yes, "sudo" is much more convenient than " -g"
[22:49] btipling: you ran into some problem right?
[22:49] stevenj: maybe if you installed node with sudo you might need to install npm with sudo
[22:49] btipling: and you had to spend some time figuring out that you need to install with -g right?
[22:49] Nexxy: btipling, are you speaking to me?
[22:49] btipling: and had you used sudo you wouldn't have to worry about it right? right?
[22:49] btipling: yes
[22:49] Nexxy: lol
[22:49] Nexxy: no
[22:49] Nexxy: you're completely misunderstanding what I'm saying
[22:49] btipling: maybe
[22:49] Nexxy: I was talking about node-inspector
[22:50] btipling: this is a pointless discussion, sudo is fine, it's not any less securre than running as a user and it's convenient
[22:50] Nexxy: ACTION rolls eyes
[22:50] btipling: feel free to do what works for you
[22:50] Nexxy: okay :)
[22:50] btipling: k
[22:50] Nexxy: forgive me for my attempt to help you understand ;3
[22:50] Nexxy: I will know better next time.
[22:51] btipling: Nexxy: I appreciate you letting me know about node-inspector, really
[22:51] Nexxy: I'm glad!
[22:51] btipling: wasn't trying to make anyone angry
[22:51] btipling: :/
[22:51] Nexxy: I'm not angry at all ;3 I am incapable of anger

[22:52] btipling: ok
[22:52] m0rganic has left the channel
[22:52] Nexxy: it's just silly when someone insists that "sudo is fine" when npm's own author specifically reinforces my point with "I strongly encourage you not to do package management with sudo! Packages can run arbitrary scripts, which makes sudoing a package manager command as safe as a chainsaw haircut. Sure, it's fast and definitely going to cut through any obstacles, but you might actually want that obstacle to stay there."
[22:52] btipling: that statement applies to the old version
[22:52] Nexxy: ACTION sighs
[22:52] Nexxy: okay :)
[22:52] btipling: :P
[22:53] btipling: the new one doesn't have the warning anymore
[22:53] Nexxy: apparently the new version of npm modifies the way sudo works!
[22:53] btipling: lol
[22:54] stevenj: apparently taking out an output to stdout makes using sudo safe
[22:56] rmustacc: The main idea is that rather than running npm as a user with elevated privileges the entire time it downgrades privileges such that while aribtrary scripts may still be executed they aren't being down as a user with elevated prvileges.
[22:57] rmustacc: *aren't being run as
[22:57] Nexxy: so we escalate so we can deescalate!
[22:57] Nexxy: sounds logical!
[22:57] btipling: no
[22:58] Nexxy: maybe i'm missing something here... what benefit does it provide to run as sudo? maybe I've just been doing things completely wrong all this time!
[22:58] btipling: your user has more privileges than the one the arbitrary scripts run in, if I understand it correctly
[22:58] btipling: so you actually get more security from using sudo, as long as you trust npm
[22:58] bgould has joined the channel
[22:59] Nexxy: perhaps I don't understand the *nix user system as well as I thought

[22:59] cronopio has joined the channel
[22:59] Aria: Yeah. npm doesn't trust stuff other people provide.
[23:00] Aria: So give it sudo and it will deprivilege it further.
[23:00] rmustacc: You need certain prvileges temporairly (in the apache case opening port 80) and then want to run as a user with privileges.
[23:00] rmustacc: Sorry, run as a user without privilegs

[23:02] stevenj: but what resource does npm need sudo for?
[23:03] stevenj: and what is the user without privileges?
[23:03] mscdex: boghog: it's part of v8/javascript
[23:03] Aria: stevenj: it can install scripts for systemwide use.
[23:04] pquerna: ask ryan anything. hrm.
[23:04] Aria: (and, it can sandbox scripts it runs if it can setuid.)
[23:04] boaz has joined the channel
[23:05] rmustacc: By default it'll run as nobody

[23:15] xiagox has joined the channel
[23:19] rmustacc: sh1mmer: Looks like it's related to the v8 Script object which expects a filename to map the code to.
[23:20] sh1mmer: hm, I'll ask Ry later
[23:20] sh1mmer: I can't figure out what actual difference it makes
[23:21] rmustacc: Yeah, the filename seems to be something v8 is using internally, and if you don't specify it it just makes one up it appears.
[23:21] sh1mmer: String::New("evalmachine.<anonymous>")
[23:21] sh1mmer: if it isn't using the filename

[23:41] eydaimon: mscdex: when I did just a console.log(req) I didn't get the info at all. is there a way I could have gotten it to print. I don't understand how the pipe allows it to print it
[23:42] gonsfx: i want to set an object property in any depths on an object. something along the lines of set(obj, 'prop1.prop2.prop3', 27) with set = function(obj, key, value)
[23:42] mscdex: eydaimon: pipe() just handles all the listening for 'data' events on the readable stream and doing the writing to the writable stream
[23:43] mscdex: and automatically handles any pausing and resuming as necessary
[23:43] gonsfx: because i can't just do obj[key] = value and won't use eval, i need recursion. 
[23:43] gonsfx: anyone done this before?
[23:44] mscdex: gonsfx: so why not do obj.prop1.prop2.prop3 = 27 ?
[23:44] gonsfx: thats what i'm trying to do. problem is that i'm getting 'prop1.prop2.prop3' as a string
[23:44] mscdex: oh
[23:45] gonsfx: and obj as an object and i want set({}, 'prop1.foo', 'bar') to result in {prop1:{foo:'bar'}}
[23:45] mscdex: i think someone wrote a module some time back to do that
[23:47] eydaimon: mscdex: What if I have a bad client which doesn't close the connection properly. Can I set a timeout to close the connection on the server side?
[23:47] mscdex: eydaimon: what do you mean doesn't close it properly?
[23:48] eydaimon: mscdex: i've got some hardware that makes a post, but then doesn't close the connection once the post is made
[23:49] mscdex: eydaimon: huh? it's probably expecting a response
[23:50] eydaimon: mscdex:  the client is broken basically, and there's nothign I can do to fix it
[23:50] mscdex: eydaimon: are you sending a response after you get the request?
