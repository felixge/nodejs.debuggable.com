[02:09] Nuck: elliottcable: It's not like it's more pain on the joiner's part?
[02:09] elliottcable: Nuck ‚Ä∫ it‚Äôs more pain because people kept having to ask me to +I their alt nickames or bots or wtfever
[02:10] elliottcable: it‚Äôs just too much work all around, and Nobody Cares‚Ñ¢
[02:10] Nuck: elliottcable: ah
[02:10] elliottcable: jerrysv ‚Ä∫ I was just doing that for humour, by the way; you‚Äôre welcome if you‚Äôd like to visit, but I guarantee you you‚Äôll be bored.

[02:19] Nuck: elliottcable: I've maanged to stop getting in scary cutthroat arguments with her.
[02:19] elliottcable: but I‚Äôve blood-sworn to my friend, her SO, that I wouldn‚Äôt say anything further bad about Nexxy, so <silence/>
[02:19] Nuck: So that's an improvement.
[02:19] elliottcable: Nuck ‚Ä∫ I thought you just /ignore‚Äôd her forever or something
[02:19] jerrysv: that said, no, i've never met her.  i know a lot of women in tech, but not her.

[05:39] kenperkins: oh well
[05:39] Nuck: I'm starting a company too
[05:39] Nuck: artuous.com
[05:39] Nuck: We're also building on Node.js
[05:39] kenperkins: datastore>
[05:40] Nuck: kenperkins: Mongo for longterm, behind Mongoose
[05:40] Nuck: Redis for caching
[05:41] deoxxa: ooh ooh are we doing show and tell? :D
[05:41] kenperkins: gotcha
[05:41] Nuck: lol
[05:41] Nuck: kenperkins: We have some things which require millisecond responses that Mongo just can't provide
[05:41] kenperkins: I hear ya
[05:42] kenperkins: client code?
[05:43] Nuck: kenperkins: Well, templating with Handlebars, clientside JS through jQuery and some custom libs
[05:44] deoxxa: http://i.imgur.com/PaUOK.png
[05:44] deoxxa: this is what i've built at work with node :3
[05:44] deoxxa: real time event reporting for GPS tracking devices

[05:44] kenperkins: ok tell me more
[05:45] Nuck: tell me more, tell me more, like does he have a car :D
[05:45] Nuck: ACTION breaks into sudden musicals
[05:45] deoxxa: haha
[05:45] Nuck: I hope no VC ever asks me to tell them more ;-;
[05:45] Nuck: For their sake
[05:45] Nuck: They don't wanna hear me sing
[05:46] deoxxa: data comes from the devices in commercial vehicles (mostly mining trucks and stuff) and contains information like engine statistics, speed, location, time, etc
[05:46] kenperkins: i've been so fried from media coverage for 2 days
[05:46] kenperkins: i just want to chat
[05:46] kenperkins: if that means having fun in here relaxing learning about your stuff 
[05:46] kenperkins: that's good by me
[05:46] Nuck: kenperkins: haha
[05:46] deoxxa: hits a "collector" that decodes the various binary protocols (we support about 5 different devices)
[05:46] kenperkins: mining trucks?
[05:46] Nuck: kenperkins: sounds like you had a good launch tho
[05:47] kenperkins: Nuck: it's hard to imagine much more positive coverage than we've had so far (wait's for the shoe to drop)
[05:47] vicapow: and suggestions for removing padding from strings?
[05:47] deoxxa: goes from there to our "data processor" that fetches information like geographic zone, driver information, speed limit, etc
[05:47] Nuck: vicapow: Like, trim()?
[05:47] deoxxa: then ends up inside mongodb in two collections; one capped and one regular
[05:47] deoxxa: kenperkins: basically huuuuge trucks out at mining operations
[05:47] vicapow: Nuck: possible. /me  goes and looks up trim 
[05:48] deoxxa: like, trucks with wheels bigger than your average house
[05:48] deoxxa: crazy stuff
[05:48] kenperkins: wow
[05:48] Nuck: deoxxa: Holy fuck.

[05:48] kenperkins: awesome.
[05:48] kenperkins: why mongo for guys?
[05:48] kenperkins: (I've become a bit of a riak fan)
[05:48] Nuck: deoxxa: How many of these bigass trucks do you guys have?
[05:48] Nuck: kenperkins: It's queryable JSON
[05:49] Nuck: That's all I had to hear and I was sold
[05:49] deoxxa: oh we don't own the trucks, we just sell the GPS devices and monitoring platform to companies that do
[05:49] Nuck: It's if SQL met JSON
[05:49] kenperkins: ah, so you guys like the arbitrary queries :)
[05:49] kenperkins: yea, that's not so critical for me :) but I see the appeal as an old rdbms guhy
[05:49] deoxxa: we're using mongodb because it lets us map the data coming from these units (which is all sorts of random stuff) directly to database records
[05:50] Nuck: kenperkins: yeah.  Mongo isn't the most reliable sadly
[05:50] kenperkins: aware :)
[05:50] deoxxa: the reliability thing was an issue for us as well
[05:50] Nuck: That's one thing I expect my SA to do for me :P
[05:50] Nuck: He gets to learn the tweakings :P
[05:51] deoxxa: we've written all our software to allow us to replay logs of data to reconstruct databases if they become unrecoverable
[05:51] Nuck: deoxxa: The word is "journalled"
[05:51] Nuck: And Mongo has it now too :P
[05:51] deoxxa: that also comes in handy for fixing bugs in the augmentation process as well
[05:51] deoxxa: ah not quite, it's not a log of database operations
[05:51] Nuck: Honestly, most of our data isn't technically critical
[05:51] deoxxa: it's more just a raw log of what comes in off the wire (after being decoded)
[05:52] deoxxa: we have crazy SLAs where we're required to process and store something like 99.999% of data that gets to us
[05:52] deoxxa: we're not responsible for transport problems, thankfully

[05:54] kenperkins: oh contrare, monfrare
[05:54] Nuck: I expect my platform to be dealt with by my SA and whoever he chooses to hire if ever we need more people
[05:54] kenperkins: keeping devs from being productive is the hardest fucking job on earth

[05:55] kenperkins: not that clipboard is huge (5 people incl founder) but we're all just engineers. no dbas. no specialists.
[05:55] deoxxa: only if they're in the same building as the devs
[05:55] deoxxa: ninjapig: in very big operations, they'll generally take care of making sure backups are up to date, databases are tuned correctly, etc, etc
[05:55] deoxxa: along with letting the devs know if something they're doing is making things slow
[05:56] objectiveous has joined the channel
[05:56] deoxxa: well, ideally, anyway
[05:56] Nuck: kenperkins: we have an SA, two website devs and a man who does primarily mobile dev (but also pitches in for the site)
[05:56] Nuck: With something like Mongo, plus a new platform like Node, we need an SA
[05:56] deoxxa: git is our sysadmin
[05:56] deoxxa: haha
[05:57] kenperkins: YAY
[05:57] kenperkins: new BMW 3 is out, and I still like mine better.
[05:57] deoxxa: we have no time at work for SA, so i cooked up a system where all the configs and software versions are kept in git repositories
[05:57] kenperkins: terrified i would have to replace it
[05:58] Nuck: BMW 3?
[05:58] mmalecki: deoxxa: no need to do it by yourself, there are such systems

[09:50] kerx: hi all, i'm a bit curious to know what the practical applications of node.js are (if any) beyond web service development (i.e.: chat servers, and the like for the web)
[09:51] predat0r has joined the channel
[09:51] predat0r has left the channel
[09:52] kerx: for example, could node.js be used to create a SMTP server?
[09:52] Jarda: yes
[09:52] deoxxa: kerx: we use node.js at work to do all sorts of stuff; specifically in the realm of M2M (machine-to-machine) applications
[09:53] kerx: amazing
[09:53] kerx: for me at least
[09:53] deoxxa: kerx: to do that, we have to handle a whole bunch of weird binary protocols, but i've found it's relatively painless
[09:53] deoxxa: especially with node-binary
[09:53] Jarda: https://github.com/aredridel/node-smtp
[09:53] kerx: are there open source things up that i could view?
[09:54] deoxxa: heaps, search github for node under javascript
[09:54] deoxxa: or poke around npmjs.org's search area
[09:54] kerx: also, any suggested references beyond the basics that gear one towards designing more systems level nodejs?
[09:55] deoxxa: the manual is a good place to start (cliched as it may be)
[09:55] kerx: so essentially, one could replace many tasks w/ node.js that one were doing in say C/C++?
[09:55] deoxxa: getting to know how EventEmitter works is a good step as well
[09:55] kerx: what about performance comparisons?
[09:56] kerx: sorry for these weird questions, I'm just very curious
[09:56] deoxxa: it's not so much replacing the low level stuff as augmenting it; we've got a bunch of native code running as modules in node to do heavier processing or stuff we already had code for in c++
[09:56] __doc__ has joined the channel
[09:56] deoxxa: performance comparisons are kind of a hit and miss deal, they'll show different results depending on what you're testing
[09:57] deoxxa: i find it's easier to scale out node.js applications because it's simple to get them deployed and running for the most part
[09:57] deoxxa: whereas with a native application, you've got dependencies and stuff to worry about
[09:57] kerx: not looking for a exact answer, and not trying to make this a huge deal, but let's just say sockets in Perl vs. sockets in node would be?
[09:57] deoxxa: node would win by a long shot, i'd say
[09:58] deoxxa: but it's not really directly comparable
[09:58] abraxas has joined the channel
[09:58] kerx: ok, i get the idea
[09:59] kerx: deoxxa, what are the limitations that node has that you haven't ported everything in C++ ?
[09:59] deoxxa: well, anything involving a lot of bit-twiddling is awkward in javascript
[09:59] markwubben has joined the channel
[10:00] ecthiender has joined the channel
[10:00] deoxxa: and cpu-bound code is just better suited to being kept native

[10:00] herbySk has joined the channel
[10:00] kerx: i've been looking to learn a new dynamic language
[10:00] deoxxa: i like to think of node (for my uses) as an awesome framework for tying together different components
[10:01] kerx: considering erlang recently
[10:01] kerx: but node just caught my attention
[10:01] kerx: i read an article about Mozrepl, and someone mentioned nodejs
[10:01] deoxxa: erlang is definitely cool, but there's a pretty high barrier of entry unless you're familiar with a message passing language already
[10:02] TheJH has joined the channel
[10:02] kerx: would nodejs be comparable to erlang in the sense of it's scalability features?
[10:02] kerx: the OTP framework is what I'm referring to (i believe)
[10:02] kerx: the languages syntax kind of scares me away
[10:02] deoxxa: well, node doesn't really have any features to do that on its own
[10:02] kerx: it's very Lisp-ish, which I've always been scared of
[10:02] deoxxa: but it does encourage you to write your code in a way that makes it easy to do
[10:03] deoxxa: so most node.js code out there lends itself well to clustering
[10:03] kerx: ok, i think it's best i get node running on my vps, and play around with it
[10:03] kerx: any specific projects you would recommend (non web based stuff)
[10:03] kerx: node-smtp is one i'm looking at now
[10:04] kerx: any others?
[10:04] deoxxa: hmm, let's think...
[10:05] deoxxa: https://github.com/nornagon/nodecraft << i always wanted this to go a bit further
[10:06] kerx: awesome, gaming involved

[11:01] thisandagain has joined the channel
[11:04] TheJH: OneOfOne, are you talking about those written in javascript or those written in C++?
[11:05] OneOfOne: TheJH: javascript, https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/console.js for example
[11:05] TheJH: OneOfOne, it just puts the plain javascript into the generated executable :D
[11:06] OneOfOne: TheJH: aaahhh
[11:06] TheJH: OneOfOne, you can grep for the javascript inside the executable :D
[11:07] OneOfOne: TheJH: lol i was hoping it was something complicated and awesome
[11:07] TheJH: OneOfOne, me too some while back :D
[11:07] TheJH: OneOfOne, btw, the compilation of that js code at startup time takes a significant part of the time needed to start up node

[11:09] TheJH: OneOfOne, https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/1538 - "Startup time: Uglify JS included in the node binary: 10% less time needed"
[11:09] OneOfOne: ha 
[11:11] TheJH: we need some kind of AST serialization :D
[11:11] criswell has joined the channel
[11:11] TheJH: but the node core devs also dont want to maintain own patches for v8
[11:11] OneOfOne: i think a compile time option would be pretty good
[11:12] TheJH: nah, makes it hard to trace back errors and really, uglifying isn't such a good idea
[11:12] TheJH: saving the ast would be so much better

[12:12] TheJH: thomaschaaf, what does "whereis node" say?
[12:13] thomaschaaf: node: /usr/bin/node /usr/local/bin/node /usr/local/lib/node /usr/share/man/man1/node.1.gz 
[12:14] thomaschaaf: and /usr/bin/node -v is 0.4.12
[12:14] thomaschaaf: and /usr/local/bin/node is 0.2.0
[12:16] TheJH: thomaschaaf, so, you have /usr/local/bin/node because you compiled it from source and /usr/bin/node because you installed the package. Either run "make uninstall" in the source folder or uninstall the package and reinstall from source
[12:18] thomaschaaf: so I have to download 0.2.0 again and then make uninstall?
[12:19] TheJH: thomaschaaf, should work, I think

[13:39] japj: TheJH: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Audio_Data_API
[13:39] TheJH: japj, no, server side. And I want to analyze the actual audio data. E.g. when there's a noise, I want to see that the volume went up and when and how many oscillations happened and how high the frquency is
[13:40] TheJH: japj, I want to do it in a console application
[13:40] japj: TheJH: so you want to record audio from a connected microphone and analyse it?
[13:40] deoxxa: TheJH: PCM is pretty simple, if you can get your audio in that format
[13:41] hkjels has joined the channel

[13:48] japj: hkjels: maybe it's usefull to use a logging library that can be turned off in testing mode? or overwrite console.log or something ;)

[17:58] AvianFlu: japj: there are a few windows fixes that still need landing there, it was only linux tested at first
[17:58] mmalecki: japj: good point, I'm working on using path.join instead of '/' through whole vows

[18:11] mmalecki: mikola3: nodejitsu is free as well
[18:11] AvianFlu: downtime?
[18:11] mikola3: ok, I will take a look
[18:11] mmalecki: disclaimer: I work for nodejitsu
[18:11] AvianFlu: what is this downtime you speak of?
[18:11] franck34: or, do you know any alternative of "formidable" but working with application/octet-stream file upload ?
[18:11] mikola3: hahaha, ok

[18:15] mikola3: no, there is no three.js
[18:16] mikola3: it is just webgl
[18:16] Iszak: I know, why did you choose not to use three.js is what I'm asking
[18:16] mikola3: what is the point of using it?
[18:16] Iszak: easier interface for working with webgl
[18:16] mikola3: I don't see much advantage over just calling webgl directly...
[18:16] mikola3: not really...
[18:17] mikola3: unless you don't want shaders or anything like that

[18:19] tilgovi has joined the channel
[18:19] Iszak: mikola3, it's calling /socket.io/1/xhr-polling is that to say it's not using web sockets but xhr?

[18:20] Iszak: mikoScript error (http://mmotest.nodester.com/browserify.js:1) -- Uncaught Error: Lost connection to network
[18:20] mikola3: It should be using websocket as the default transport, not sure why it is using xhr polling...
[18:21] Iszak: people do realise that web sockets are a changing API?
[18:21] japj: mikola3: when I move around it resets me to my starting position after a couple of seconds
[18:21] infynyxx_ has joined the channel
[18:21] mikola3: japj that is a connection problem
[18:21] mikola3: if you lag too much it does some position correction
[18:21] mikola3: but only if your round trip ping is >600ms
[18:21] japj: mikola3: and the application has crashed
[18:21] mikola3: probably due to it using xhr polling...
[18:21] Iszak: mikola3, xhr => unplayable, websockets => awesome (FF stable)
[18:21] japj: mikola3: lost connection to network
[18:21] Iszak: yeah just got that
[18:22] mikola3: yeah, same here
[18:22] mikola3: hmm
[18:22] mikola3: for some reason it keeps using xhr polling..  not sure why though
[18:22] robertstuttaford has left the channel
[18:22] Iszak: but from what I saw, some cool stuff.
[18:22] mikola3: I got the latest stable version of socket.io on there too...
[18:22] mikola3: well, I will try to see if I can fix it
[18:22] Iszak: mikola3, maybe the npm package is out of date?
[18:23] mikola3: maybe
[18:23] Iszak: use git instead?
[18:23] mikola3: yeah...
[18:23] mikola3: though configuring that on nodester is a pain in the a**
[18:23] infynyxx has joined the channel
[18:23] Iszak: go with heroku then..

[18:28] mikola3: any success?
[18:28] AvianFlu: Iszak, I've heard it from a number of their users
[18:28] AvianFlu: I was told their scaling infrastructure can't support websockets at present
[18:29] mikola3: AvianFlu: That's awful...
[18:29] CarterL has joined the channel
[18:29] AvianFlu: dealing with the upgrade event properly is non-trivial
[18:29] AvianFlu: and websockets are very recent
[18:29] AvianFlu: it's just how stuff works sometimes
[18:29] mmalecki: yes.
[18:29] mikola3: I almost don't see the point of using something like node.js if you don't have websockets...
[18:30] AvianFlu: It can serve HTML plenty well too (node I mean)
[18:30] AvianFlu: but yeah, websockets are awesome
[18:30] mikola3: of course I would expect that situation will improve over time
[18:30] AvianFlu: yeah, the spec is becoming more stable
[18:30] AvianFlu: down the road a little everyone and their mom will have websockets
[18:30] mikola3: yeah, but websockets are definitely the killer feature for node
[18:30] mikola3: dealing with them in any other web platform right now is such an absolute nightmare
[18:31] mikola3: Iszak:  Did you get a chance to try out the new version?  I took out the xhr transport so it should use only websockets
[18:32] kriszyp has joined the channel
[18:33] mikola3: is there an up-to-date list of all the transports that socket.io supports?
[18:35] AvianFlu: in their docs probably, there are a bunch of transports

[19:37] aroman: TheJH: that's what I figured
[19:37] aroman: TheJH: you'd reccommend node-static?
[19:38] TheJH: aroman, let me check
[19:39] AvianFlu: aroman, you might look at http-server too, it's a simplified wrapper around our vendored fork of node-static
[19:39] gregmoreno has joined the channel
[19:39] AvianFlu: (cloudhead is off writing erlang instead of maintaining his node projects, apparently)
[19:40] aroman: well, the thing is I'm also using socketIO
[19:40] TheJH: AvianFlu, where is that fork?
[19:40] aroman: so it's not like I want purely a static file server.
[19:41] AvianFlu: http-server returns its http server object, which I think you can just pass into io.listen or whatever
[19:41] AvianFlu: unless I'm confused and that was 0.6.x socket.io
[19:41] AvianFlu: not returns, persists
[19:41] AvianFlu: it's this.httpServer once you have the object
[19:41] TheJH: AvianFlu, link?

[19:43] TheJH: aroman, I think node-static is ok

[19:47] TheJH: diogogmt, err, I mean "can't"
[19:47] AvianFlu: do you see the comment on that first commit? it was a bad commit
[19:47] diogogmt: ohh....
[19:47] diogogmt: thats the problem then
[19:47] TheJH: schwab, javascript. but you can use everything that compiled to javascript, too
[19:47] scottschecter has joined the channel
[19:47] TheJH: AvianFlu, yes, and the second one I linked fixed that, I think
[19:47] diogogmt: if I just checkout to antoher node branch would fix it? Or do I ened to resintall?
[19:47] schwab: ok...
[19:47] TheJH: AvianFlu, anyway, you seem to still have the RegExp one
[19:48] schwab: so node.js is pure client side programming?!
[19:48] schwab: or do you code js on the server somehow?
[19:48] AvianFlu: schwab, no, server
[19:48] TheJH: AvianFlu, and the RegExp one might cause security issues
[19:48] AvianFlu: I'll look at it TheJH, thanks
[19:48] TheJH: diogogmt, "checkout 0.4.12; ./configure&&make&&make install"

[19:48] Shoeb: Hi,
[19:49] AvianFlu: schwab, it's javascript that runs in google's v8 VM on top of an async i/o platform called libuv, and we do lots of server-side things with it
[19:49] schwab: o wow
[19:49] Shoeb: I need some help regarding node. I am a newbee and everything is messed up. its not installing jade. 
[19:49] schwab: so dart could replace it
[19:50] AvianFlu: dart may or may not amount to anything yet
[19:50] AvianFlu: and dart won't run in v8, it will have its own vm
[19:50] chjj: node.dart - whos with me?!
[19:50] Shoeb: I need some help regarding node. I am a newbee and everything is messed up. its not installing jade.
[19:50] AvianFlu: but down the road, if someone wanted to, sure
[19:50] cafesofie: chjj: it's called java :P

[19:52] TheJH: Shoeb, could you be more specific?
[19:52] chjj: i hope its not .dart, im going to use my own extension if thats the case
[19:52] cafesofie: it is .darrt
[19:52] chjj: assuming ill even use dart

[19:55] xerox: TheJH is full of anger
[19:55] cafesofie: the hate for dart is pretty funny
[19:56] mikolalysenko: I don't even know why google is bothering with dart, it just seems like a waste of effort to me
[19:56] mikolalysenko: why not just build a vm instead?
[19:56] chjj: why not make a language not inspired by java?
[19:56] cafesofie: eich has talked a lot about how a vm wouldn't solve much
[19:56] `3rdEden has joined the channel
[19:56] mikolalysenko: eich is full of crap on this point imo
[19:57] mikolalysenko: I've seen his arguments and I just don't buy it
[19:57] mikolalysenko: all of the stuff he says applies equally well to dart
[19:57] chjj: i assumed that a long time ago when i heard he liked coffeescript
[19:57] strgzr has joined the channel
[19:57] cafesofie: not that eich likes dart
[19:57] strgzr: gidday
[19:57] mikolalysenko: mainly just that it will be a nightmare to fix the standardization problems posed by a new web language/vm etc.
[19:57] Nuck: Honestly, I like the way Dart expresses certain things, but their compiler is shit, and the language itself I hear is shitty on a deeper level
[19:58] strgzr: I'm brand new. Is there a text editor in Node?
[19:58] MatthewS has joined the channel
[19:58] cafesofie: i don't think the complaint is that dart is a bad language so much that it's bland
[19:58] trotter has joined the channel
[19:59] AvianFlu: strgzr, use any editor you want
[19:59] mikolalysenko: I think the main complaint is that it doesn't really fix anything
[19:59] AvianFlu: there's even a good one on the internet, cloud 9 ide
[19:59] mikolalysenko: you basically swap out one slow, flawed scripting language for another
[19:59] cafesofie: i really wish mozilla would adopt pepper though
[19:59] mikolalysenko: you still have to do stupid crap like minify and obfuscate dart before you can transmit it
[19:59] strgzr: I put a javascript file in every location I could think of, but node can't find it

[19:59] cafesofie: nacl seems like the best idea so far
[19:59] cafesofie: (pnacl anyway)
[19:59] mikolalysenko: yeah, but it has its own issues
[19:59] mikolalysenko: pnacl is good
[20:00] mikolalysenko: but it seems like they are pushing nacl instead (why?  I have no freaking clue...)
[20:00] cafesofie: mozilla has basically told google to go fuck themself over pepper though
[20:00] cafesofie: so i doubt it'll happen for some time
[20:00] mikolalysenko: sad
[20:00] Nuck: I think Dart was not different enough from JS to be worth a full compilation
[20:01] Nuck: Seriously, they did a heavy compiler when all they needed was something lightweight
[20:01] chjj: nacl strikes me as overambitious, and i say this as someone who loves google
[20:01] mikolalysenko: yeah, but pnacl on the other hand could work
[20:01] mikolalysenko: nacl doesn't seem to me like the right solution
[20:01] Nuck: Nacl strikes me as pointless and highly insecure
[20:01] mikolalysenko: it just lacks enough portability and security to be a sensible solution
[20:01] Nuck: Scripting is the way of the world
[20:01] Nuck: Online, that is
[20:01] mikolalysenko: plus, you have to compile/transmit a code object for each ISA you want to support (wtf?)
[20:02] Nuck: Even our servers are scripting languages and have been for a long time
[20:02] mikolalysenko: it is just like an OS X fat binary
[20:02] cafesofie: really i'm just depressed at the whole situation. people are clearly hacking around the entire web stack as best as they can but no one can agree on how to fix things
[20:02] chjj: it also seems kind of pointless, in 10-20 years, when our Vms are so absurdly fast due to hardware improvements, all the work to implement nacl might not have been worth it
[20:02] Nuck: mikolalysenko: Yeah, it'd be better set up like the JVM
[20:02] mikolalysenko: probably
[20:02] mikolalysenko: except the JVM has a terrible interface to the DOM
[20:02] Nuck: mikolalysenko: well duh
[20:02] mikolalysenko: and so applets are slow and broken crap
[20:02] Nuck: But I mean, with the two-step compiling
[20:02] neilk_ has joined the channel
[20:02] Nuck: You have it compiled to a system-independent language
[20:02] Nuck: Then you run that in a VM
[20:02] mikolalysenko: and sun ^h^h^h oracle is not gonna fix that any time soon
[20:02] cafesofie: even as js vms get faster we'll just want more and more, and it's already a shit ton of work to make them work the way they do now
[20:03] TheJH: cafesofie, NaCl? Isn't that a crypto library?
[20:03] TheJH: !nm info nacl
[20:03] mikolalysenko: I think vms can work
[20:03] TheJH: !npm info nacl
[20:03] jhbot: nacl by Jann Horn, version 0.1.1: Networking and Cryptography library bindings - high-speed, high-security, easy-to-use crypto library
[20:03] chjj: huh?
[20:03] Nuck: TheJH: haha
[20:03] mikolalysenko: look at the latest jvms, they approach native C performance in many cases
[20:03] chjj: oh
[20:03] cafesofie: i'm assuming you know what native client is and just want to point out an acronym collision
[20:03] mikolalysenko: a vm makes tons of sense here
[20:03] Nuck: TheJH: NaCl, the Native code language
[20:03] Nuck: Not what I assume is your library :P
[20:04] Nuck: JH = Jann Horn, I'm guessing :P
[20:04] TheJH: Nuck, NaCl, the Networking and Cryptography library. And my package is just a binding.
[20:04] mandric has joined the channel
[20:04] Nuck: TheJH: ah
[20:04] mikolalysenko: nacl is just active x with fat ELFs
[20:04] chjj: lol, TheJH, shameless advertising ;p
[20:04] Nuck: mikolalysenko: yeaaaaaaah
[20:04] mikolalysenko: it doesn't seem to me like a very good idea
[20:04] Nuck: It's ActiveX
[20:04] Nuck: From Google!
[20:04] cafesofie: activex with security
[20:04] mikolalysenko: pnacl on the other hand is a good idea
[20:04] cafesofie: it's not the same thing at all
[20:04] mikolalysenko: it is a jvm without java
[20:04] mikolalysenko: and a fast dom interface
[20:04] mikolalysenko: great!
[20:04] TheJH: ACTION goes on advertising for NaCl
[20:04] TheJH: http://nacl.cr.yp.to/
[20:05] mikolalysenko: but google seems to be less than enthusiastic about pushing it
[20:05] Nuck: I disagree.  I say that JS is the language of the web.  Get over it.
[20:05] mikolalysenko: nuck: today, but it doesn't have to be
[20:05] cafesofie: mikolalysenko: i don't know why you're drawing such a distinction between nacl and pnacl. pnacl just isn't as far developed
[20:05] Nuck: mikolalysenko: I like it this way
[20:05] cafesofie: mikolalysenko: it's not like they've forgotten about pnacl in favor of the other
[20:05] mikolalysenko: you could still do js in a vm
[20:05] stagas has joined the channel
[20:05] Nuck: I'm with Eich: Always bet on JavaScript.
[20:06] Kunda has joined the channel
[20:06] mikolalysenko: plus it could be much smaller
[20:06] Nuck: As the needs change, JS changes
[20:06] cafesofie: and the javascript stockholm syndrome is one of the more depressing things about the web today :P
[20:06] mikolalysenko: sending plaintext source code over a network is crazy
[20:06] mikolalysenko: sure, but that would be even easier to deal with in a vm
[20:06] Nuck: cafesofie: IT's not nearly as bad as people think
[20:06] mikolalysenko: want to upgrade js?
[20:06] mikolalysenko: don't worry about it!  Just update your compiler
[20:06] mikolalysenko: don't have to worry about broken clients with half assed implementations
[20:07] mikolalysenko: as long as they support a simple virtual isa, your code would just work
[20:07] Nuck: mikolalysenko: That's an awful idea
[20:07] mikolalysenko: why?
[20:07] Nuck: Then you hafta transfer the entire compiler
[20:07] Nuck: That's retarded
[20:07] Ang3 has joined the channel
[20:07] mikolalysenko: I bet it would still be smaller than sending a raw javascript file

[20:07] Nuck: mikolalysenko: Not likely
[20:07] Nuck: JS files are *tiny*
[20:07] Ang3: o/
[20:07] mikolalysenko: you just encode and link the run time, it would be about on the order of a .o file
[20:07] Sidnicious has left the channel
[20:08] mikolalysenko: or a normal elf
[20:08] mikolalysenko: you just compile and link it, then send it
[20:08] Nuck: mikolalysenko: Seriously.  Transferring a full VM on each site?  I ought to slap you.
[20:08] mikolalysenko: that's not as big a deal as you would think
[20:08] mikolalysenko: a vm in machine code could be very small
[20:09] mikolalysenko: especially if you write it in a portable byte code
[20:09] mmalecki has joined the channel

[20:09] Nuck: JS > NaCl.
[20:09] xtianw has joined the channel
[20:09] chjj: mikolalysenko is right though, vms can be very small
[20:09] Nuck: Sure, but it's ridiculous to transfer a VM with each request
[20:09] mikolalysenko: you wouldn't though
[20:09] mikolalysenko: you would cache it
[20:09] chjj: cache?
[20:10] mikolalysenko: just like any ordinary web page
[20:10] Nuck: mikolalysenko: Cool, with each new site I visit
[20:10] Nuck: I get another VM
[20:10] Nuck: And another
[20:10] Nuck: And another
[20:10] Nuck: And another
[20:10] Nuck: And another
[20:10] Nuck: And another
[20:10] mikolalysenko: it would be about the size of a small png
[20:10] Nuck: mikolalysenko: And probably not all that fast, and prone to errors
[20:10] mikolalysenko: you don't mind downloading images for each page you go to?
[20:10] fraank000 has joined the channel
[20:10] mikolalysenko: that's speculation
[20:10] Nuck: Getting web devs to update is harder than getting people to update Chrome
[20:10] chjj: Nuck: if it were hosted by google, like googles web fonts which are pretty big themselves, the users might already have it cached
[20:10] mikolalysenko: you can make it as fast and good as you want (up to and beyond what v8 is capable of)
[20:11] Nuck: chjj: We might as well just lodge it in the browser
[20:11] Nuck: The *smart* way
[20:11] Nuck: The *sane* way
[20:11] chjj: Nuck: then you could say the same about jquery, web fonts, etc
[20:11] mikolalysenko: except that updating that way is *insane*
[20:11] Nuck: Because then we don't get incompatible dialects
[20:11] mikolalysenko: what if you need to patch something in the vm?
[20:11] Nuck: Or splintering
[20:11] mikolalysenko: or a new version comes out and you want to use that?
[20:11] Nuck: We have enough splintering as it is
[20:11] chjj: i dont even know what were talking about anymore, or even what side im on, i just wanted to argue against nuck
[20:11] mikolalysenko: yeah, but with a vm you just update to whatever version you want
[20:11] Nuck: chjj: bahaha
[20:12] Nuck: mikolalysenko: Cool, and splinter
[20:12] mikolalysenko: and keep it that way
[20:12] mikolalysenko: then it will just work everywhere
[20:12] Nuck: mikolalysenko: Slowly various VMs will splinter into factions
[20:12] mikolalysenko: if you want a patch *you* get to do it, not the browser writer
[20:12] arcanis: do you know if there is a strerror/perror equivalent in node.js ?
[20:12] Nuck: And JS will be less interoperable
[20:12] mikolalysenko: Nuck: Just like C or Java?
[20:12] Nuck: mikolalysenko: No, worse
[20:12] Nuck: mikolalysenko: In this case, we can't reuse code from one splintered VM to another
[20:12] mikolalysenko: there is an ECMA standard, and it is easier for developers to upgrade than it is for users
[20:12] Nuck: mikolalysenko: Not anymore
[20:13] mikolalysenko: it is the same situation in every other programming language
[20:13] jbpros has joined the channel
[20:13] Nuck: Both Firefox and Chrome are doing silent background updates now, IIRC
[20:13] Nuck: I think Firefox started in a recent Aurora
[20:13] mikolalysenko: gcc gets updated, but no one complains about it "splintering the language".  That argument is a total strawman.
[20:13] Nuck: MAybe into Beta now
[20:13] Nuck: mikolalysenko: No, because GCC is standard
[20:13] mikolalysenko: yeah, and so is javascript
[20:13] Nuck: Try using Windows-based C on Linux
[20:14] mikolalysenko: again a flawed argument...
[20:14] Nuck: Something written for Windows libraries will not compile well on GCC if at all
[20:14] mikolalysenko: yeah, but the point of using the vm is that you write for that one vm
[20:14] Nuck: mikolalysenko: Which is *very* bad.
[20:14] mikolalysenko: how?
[20:14] Nuck: Like, beyond bad, that's *horrible*
[20:14] mikolalysenko: why?
[20:15] Nuck: mikolalysenko: Because now you've got different dialects and can't copy code between them without some pain in your ass
[20:15] mikolalysenko: I'm saying that is unlikely to happen
[20:15] mikolalysenko: any more so than it does already today
[20:15] mikolalysenko: and across other languages
[20:15] Nuck: mikolalysenko: You just said "that you write for that one vm"
[20:15] mikolalysenko: yeah
[20:15] Nuck: That's exactly what that means
[20:15] mikolalysenko: you compile and link against a single standard ISA
[20:16] mikolalysenko: your tools can get updated and be built independent of that
[20:16] Nuck: Cool, and your code will not work on other VMs
[20:16] mikolalysenko: on the client side, it still just works
[20:16] mikolalysenko: no, the point is to make one standard vm
[20:16] Nuck: Because you did some weird mod to your VM
[20:16] mikolalysenko: you wouldn't do that
[20:16] mikolalysenko: the vm would be standard
[20:16] Nuck: Oh, and a modded VM won't be shared in caches
[20:16] Nuck: mikolalysenko: No, no it won't be.
[20:16] Nuck: People will modify it
[20:16] mikolalysenko: all browsers would implement and optimize the vm
[20:16] mikolalysenko: ok, you are confused here
[20:16] Nuck: mikolalysenko: All browsers would share a VM?
[20:16] mikolalysenko: 1.  I propose making a browser independent vm for scripting
[20:17] Nuck: mikolalysenko: Uh, no
[20:17] Nuck: That's bad
[20:17] Nuck: No diversity
[20:17] mikolalysenko: 2.  For javascript (or any other pl for that matter), just make your own tool on top of it
[20:17] Nuck: We like having about 3-5 JS engines
[20:17] mikolalysenko: just like the .net CLR/llvm/jvm/etc.
[20:17] Nuck: mikolalysenko: Sharing VM is bad
[20:17] mikolalysenko: ???
[20:17] Nuck: We need browsers to compete in ideas
[20:17] Nuck: It pushes the cool ideas forward
[20:17] mikolalysenko: Yeah, they still can
[20:17] mikolalysenko: they can offer apis and stuff
[20:17] Nuck: mikolalysenko: Not if they all share a VM
[20:18] mikolalysenko: but the vm would just be a boring old isa
[20:18] Nuck: mikolalysenko: Then there's nonstandard
[20:18] mikolalysenko: they could implement optimizations and stuff on top of that
[20:18] mikolalysenko: and they could add system calls and special hooks
[20:18] mikolalysenko: but the vm would be the same
[20:18] Nuck: I don't want them competing in features
[20:18] Nuck: I want them competing on efficiency, speed, improvements
[20:18] mikolalysenko: ???
[20:18] Nuck: One VM and that ain't happening
[20:18] mikolalysenko: right, but they can still do that in a vm style architecture
[20:18] Nuck: We'll be cemented in our ways
[20:18] mikolalysenko: you can work on optimizing byte code, not js
[20:19] Nuck: mikolalysenko: You know what?  You're a lost cause.  I give up.
[20:19] mikolalysenko: the former is an easier problem than the latter
[20:19] Nuck: ACTION shrugs and goes back to code

[20:20] mikolalysenko: You could still make and optimize your javascript interpreters, like v8 or whatever

[20:21] mikolalysenko: I don't accept "just trust me" as a valid argument
[20:21] Brandon_R: benefit who
[20:21] mikolalysenko: browser base vms instead of javascript
[20:21] Nuck: mikolalysenko: You don't accept a lot of things
[20:21] mikolalysenko: I am open to new ideas, and am willing to be persuaded
[20:22] mikolalysenko: but I am just not hearing anything very convincing other than bland assertions
[20:22] Brandon_R: that wounds awesome
[20:22] mikolalysenko: I think so!
[20:22] Brandon_R: browser based vms like java or erlang vm?
[20:22] Nuck: mikolalysenko: Why abstract another layer on top of JS, for one.  And a shared codebase among all browsers will *absolutely* never happen, mostly because it's bad.
[20:22] mikolalysenko: a browser based low level virtual machine could be really great!
[20:22] mikolalysenko: nuck: That's not what I'm saying
[20:22] Brandon_R: virtual machine for javascript and native graphics for css :)
[20:22] mmalecki: but wait, actually why?
[20:22] mikolalysenko: I'm saying that the VM would be different for each browser
[20:23] Brandon_R: and hardware acceleration for canvas
[20:23] Brandon_R: awesomeness
[20:23] chjj: yeah screw css, lets just use nacl to access opengl api directly
[20:23] mikolalysenko: the reason is that right now javascript is the browser vm, and it has problems
[20:23] Brandon_R: isn't that what dart is trying to solve
[20:23] Brandon_R: witht he dart vm
[20:23] Nuck: Brandon_R: I'm all for hardware-accelerated canvas
[20:23] mikolalysenko: kind of, but it fails
[20:23] mmalecki has joined the channel
[20:23] mikolalysenko: because dart is not really a vm language but rather a scripting replacement for javascript
[20:24] Nuck: mikolalysenko: Uh, JS has a lot fewer problems than people liek to claim
[20:24] Nuck: People diss on JS
[20:24] Nuck: A lot
[20:24] mikolalysenko: but it has some serious issues
[20:24] mikolalysenko: like lack of integers
[20:24] mikolalysenko: or arrays
[20:24] mmalecki: I THINK SOMEONE SAID DART.
[20:24] Nuck: Oh, it's not powerful enough.  Nope!
[20:24] mikolalysenko: or terrible scoping bugs
[20:24] Nuck: mikolalysenko: We have arrays, go learn JS, n00b.
[20:24] Nuck: Scoping isn't buggy, it's lexical
[20:24] mikolalysenko: they don't work like real arrays
[20:24] Brandon_R: i Said dart lol
[20:24] Nuck: mikolalysenko: Yup, they do
[20:24] dart: lol
[20:24] Nuck: mikolalysenko: You really don't understand JS, do you?
[20:24] mikolalysenko: no, you can do stuff like a = []; a['foo'] = 'bar';
[20:25] mikolalysenko: the arrays are all hash maps
[20:25] Nuck: mikolalysenko: And it becomes an Object
[20:25] chjj: dart is in here, lets kick his-- oh
[20:25] mikolalysenko: and lack of typing on the arrays means you pay a major memory overhead
[20:25] Nuck: mikolalysenko: That's because Arrays are simply other objects.  When you add a property to an array, you're actually dealing with the object part
[20:25] mikolalysenko: even if it just filled with pods
[20:25] mikolalysenko: yeah, and that is what I mean by arrays not being proper arrays
[20:25] Nuck: This is how *many* OO languages work
[20:26] mikolalysenko: real arrays in c, java, etc. are just plain old flat lists of memory
[20:26] Nuck: mikolalysenko: If you think that's bad, you shouldn't be doing OOP
[20:26] Nuck: C isn't OO
[20:26] mikolalysenko: this has a huge performance benefit, and not being able to use a flat memory model is a major drawback
[20:26] Brandon_R: c isn't object orented lol
[20:26] Brandon_R: ninjaed
[20:26] mikolalysenko: why does OO have anything to do with this?
[20:26] Sorella has joined the channel
[20:26] murilobr has joined the channel
[20:26] mikolalysenko: I am talking about a missing, performance critical language features
[20:26] mikolalysenko: that just isn't there in JS
[20:26] Nuck: mikolalysenko: In a proper OO language, everything is an Object
[20:26] Brandon_R: This is how *many* OO languages work
[20:27] mikolalysenko: I don't care about it being proper OO or whatever, I just want fast code
[20:27] Nuck: So, yes, Arrays make sense as Objects
[20:27] mikolalysenko: and arrays as objects is a huge performance overhead
[20:27] Nuck: mikolalysenko: Hence why V8 optimizes Arrays into flat lists, last I checked
[20:27] Nuck: mikolalysenko: So moot point.
[20:27] mikolalysenko: *in some cases*
[20:27] aaronmcadam has joined the channel
[20:27] mikolalysenko: but it isn't perfect
[20:27] Nuck: mikolalysenko: In any case that doesn't use an Array as an Object
[20:27] mikolalysenko: and it finicky, and you can't really count on it.
[20:27] `3rdEden has joined the channel
[20:27] Nuck: Why?  Because NOBODY uses an Array as an Object

[20:28] mikolalysenko: arguing pl stuff, always turns into a holy war...
[20:28] elliottcable: are path.exists and path.existsSync() leaving?
[20:28] Brandon_R: if you want fast use c
[20:28] mmalecki: hey, would you guys mind actually checking how this shit is implemented in v8?
[20:28] elliottcable: or more accurately, being moved to the fs module?
[20:28] elliottcable: it seems *really* odd for them to be in the path module.
[20:28] chjj: elliottcable: i think so, ive heard ry talk about it
[20:28] Nuck: elliottcable: Oh, moving to fs?  I hope so, that'd make more sense
[20:28] elliottcable: chjj ‚Ä∫ what did he say, do you remember?
[20:28] mikolalysenko: I'm going on what I've heard from google's talks on the subject
[20:28] Nuck: elliottcable: I never understood why they were in Path from the start
[20:29] elliottcable: well, convenience
[20:29] Nuck: mikolalysenko: Google fundamentally doesn't understand JS
[20:29] chjj: elliottcable: he just said it was a mistake to put them in the path module in the first place
[20:29] elliottcable: but if they *are* moving, I‚Äôm just not going to to touch them
[20:29] elliottcable:   < Nuck> mikolalysenko: Google fundamentally doesn't understand JS
[20:29] Nuck: elliottcable: haha
[20:29] elliottcable: ‚Üë that, a thousand times that
[20:29] mikolalysenko: Nuck:  what are you talking about?
[20:29] elliottcable: chjj ‚Ä∫ agreed 100)%.
[20:29] Nuck: mikolalysenko: Google does not understand JS.
[20:29] elliottcable: yeah, then I‚Äôm not touching them.
[20:29] elliottcable: I‚Äôll stick to my fs.stat, tyvm
[20:29] mikolalysenko: understand JS?  They implement the spec, what else is there to understand?
[20:29] elliottcable: mikolalysenko ‚Ä∫ lol.

[20:30] Brandon_R: help
[20:30] Nuck: elliottcable: lol
[20:30] Brandon_R: people are fighting
[20:30] mikolalysenko: ok, enough of this
[20:30] Brandon_R: i'm scared
[20:30] elliottcable: lol @ Brandon_R
[20:31] elliottcable: I didn‚Äôt see any of the context; but calling it ‚Äúfuzzy crap‚Äù to state that Google doesn‚Äôt remotely grok How To Do JS is objectively true.
[20:31] Nuck: If Google understood JS on a higher level than just "OOF LANGUAGE ME IMPLEMENT" they might have realized that Dart was a piece of shit nobody wanted.
[20:31] mikolalysenko: look, I don't think js is a bad language or anything, but I do believe that it is suboptimal from a performance perspective
[20:31] elliottcable: I mean, just look at the Closure compiler, or the absolutely horrid and disgusting piece of crap that is the GWT.
[20:31] Nuck: Google prefers Java over JS
[20:31] Nuck: elliottcable: I hate GWT
[20:31] elliottcable: mikolalysenko ‚Ä∫ agreed.
[20:31] mikolalysenko: Honestly, I don't care how google thinks about JS, but for me it is just a tool
[20:31] Brandon_R: lol you guys are probably too young to remember this
[20:31] elliottcable: mikolalysenko ‚Ä∫ I don‚Äôt think either of us was speaking to the *quality* of JS, unless it was something Nuck said before I came in.

[20:32] chjj: i give dart shit for the casing, dont they realize no one likes camelcase?
[20:32] `3rdEden has joined the channel
[20:32] mikolalysenko: and my feeling is that I would rather have a fast, portable, standard low level implementation, rather than a slippery scripting language as a performance target
[20:33] Nuck: chjj: camelCase > underscore_style
[20:33] Brandon_R: i like camelcase
[20:33] Nuck: mikolalysenko: Don't worry about speeds
[20:33] Nuck: Let the VM do that
[20:33] mikolalysenko: on the other hand, nuck rightly says that supporting a scripting language in that environment has some real costs associated to it; and that the current situation may be preferrable
[20:33] cafesofie: Nuck: hyphen-master-race
[20:33] diogogmt: hey guys
[20:33] Brandon_R: but i use the convention as depending on the language
[20:33] chjj: i dont care for underscores that much, but i at least like them better than camelcase
[20:33] diogogmt: jsut a quick question about express
[20:33] Nuck: cafesofie: haha
[20:33] Brandon_R: erlang is underscore
[20:33] mmalecki: yeah, like, really

[20:34] Nuck: elliottcable: He suggested that JS VMs be put on NaCl

[20:34] Nuck: Instead of in-browser
[20:34] fzzzy has joined the channel
[20:34] elliottcable: where we need to be headed is NaCl.
[20:34] Nuck: I called him crazy
[20:34] mikolalysenko: yeah, I will stand by that
[20:34] mikolalysenko: eventually I think that is the way to go
[20:34] cafesofie: elliottcable: mozilla has come out pretty strongly against nacl
[20:34] cafesofie: i wish they wouldn't but they are a bg
[20:34] elliottcable: JavaScript is great, and can stay around, but if we were all focused on NaCl instead of CoffeeScript and translation-to-JavaScript, we could have *real* compiled languages, and fast ones, on the web.
[20:34] cafesofie: big barrier to adoption*
[20:35] elliottcable: cafesofie ‚Ä∫ why‚Äôs that? I haven‚Äôt paid attention to the web in a while.
[20:35] mikolalysenko: yeah, I think javascript will always be around at least at some legacy level
[20:35] Nuck: elliottcable: I'd be interested to see a JS-to-NaCl compiler
[20:35] cafesofie: elliottcable: because mozilla has a serious hard on for javascript, and is convinced fast js vms + things like emscripten are the way to go
[20:35] Brandon_R: if you guys want it fast why not load an entire website into memory and only request data to be updated?
[20:35] Nuck: Which could then be expanded to have new features without browser adoption issues
[20:35] mikolalysenko: but moving forward, it makes more sense to look at smaller, tighter, vms with less overhead and more baremetal performance
[20:35] Brandon_R: like programs
[20:36] mmalecki: mikolalysenko: actually, small vms don't have JIT

[20:38] mikolalysenko: I should say that when I said small I meant "small ISA"

[20:54] mikolalysenko: yeah, the argument goes that the cable companies invested in the infrastructure so they should get some limited time monopoly
[20:54] mmalecki: fuck. did anybody get some weird socket errors with child processes on windows?
[20:54] mikolalysenko: of course what this ignores is that those infrastructure costs were heavily subsidized in the first place by tax dollars...
[20:54] Brandon_R: ahhh
[20:54] Brandon_R: that makes some sense mikolalysenko
[20:54] Nuck: mmalecki: Silent death of sockets?

[21:03] chjj: i wonder what all the compiz standalone users are going to do if it becomes coupled with unity
[21:03] Brandon_R: any of u guys married?
[21:03] chjj: Brandon_R: whats with the personal questions?
[21:04] Brandon_R: jw
[21:04] mmalecki: hm. or wait, actually, that might be us. and /dev/null
[21:04] mmalecki: seriously, fuck windows!
[21:04] TheJH: a/s/l questions to the whole channel :D
[21:04] Ang3: oh mai on omegle ? 
[21:04] Ang3: :)
[21:06] Brandon_R: where
[21:06] kurmangazy has joined the channel
[21:06] mmalecki: now, how do I open /dev/null-like stream on this useless piece of shit?
[21:07] chjj: mmalecki: huh?
[21:07] mmalecki: chjj: I need a stream which would behave like /dev/null on a sane operating systems.
[21:07] chjj: mmalecki: oh, you mean windows?
[21:07] chjj: ACTION asks google.
[21:07] mmalecki: chjj: yeah
[21:08] mmalecki: yeah, I know there's that pseudo-device
[21:08] chjj: http://www.google.com/search?q=windows+equivalent+of+%2Fdev%2Fnull
[21:08] mmalecki: but I don't want platform-specific hacks
[21:09] mmalecki: maybe npm has something interesting
[21:09] Brandon_R: newb question
[21:09] Brandon_R: what is the purpose of dev null
[21:09] chjj: its there to eat everything, its a black hole
[21:09] Ang3: LOL
[21:10] Brandon_R: jon skeet to the rescue
[21:10] Brandon_R: is there anything that guy doesn't know lol
[21:10] mmalecki: ok, I'll just fucking write it >.<
[21:10] chjj: mmalecki: what do you need it for?
[21:10] mmalecki: chjj: in vows we need to discard test output, so we send it to /dev/null
[21:11] mmalecki: actually, we bind process.stdout to /dev/null
[21:12] chjj: mmalecki: theres no other hack you could do?
[21:13] mmalecki: chjj: process.stdout.write = function () {};
[21:13] chjj: yeah ;p
[21:13] mmalecki: well, it's already dirty.
[21:13] chjj: i really have no idea what the internals of windows look like
[21:13] mmalecki: so why not try it
[21:14] mmalecki: chjj: well, it basically tries to throw a pile of shit at you when you try doing anything more complicated than copying files
[21:14] chjj: do you remember to duck?
[21:14] mmalecki: that's the trickiest thing when using their API
[21:14] kurmangazy: are you working on the Windows port of node.js?
[21:14] willwhite has joined the channel
[21:14] AvianFlu: the internals of windows are hideous
[21:15] mmalecki: no, I'm working on Windows port of vows
[21:15] kurmangazy: oh
[21:15] AvianFlu: kurmangazy, node.js mostly works on windows, he's working on making a popular test runner work on windows
[21:15] AvianFlu: it will help us move lots of modules
[21:15] kurmangazy: yeah, I ran into vows yesterday
[21:16] kurmangazy: I want to work on a better XML parsing API, but my virtual Linux is unbootable since I tried to upgrade Ubuntu
[21:17] kurmangazy: I had a feeling that doing the Ubuntu upgrade was a bad idea
[21:18] Ang3: that's always a bad idea to upgrade the after the release :)
[21:18] mmalecki: what the fucking fuck?!
[21:18] chjj: ive had ubuntu just completely die on my machine, from a fresh install, it can be avoided by not installing ubuntu i think
[21:18] cody-- has joined the channel
[21:19] mmalecki: no, idiot, it's not a socket!
[21:19] mmalecki: actually, it is
[21:19] mmalecki: but why the fuck would writing to it result in an error?
[21:19] kurmangazy: heh.. chjj.. I'm running it in VirtualBox, and last time I tried to change kernels it wouldn't boot. I didn't know Ubuntu would forceably change kernels on me
[21:19] mmalecki: I'm done for today. gotta do some real porting.
[21:20] chjj: thats what usually happens after a dist-upgrade

[21:22] chjj: kurmangazy: you would love arch linux or gentoo then ;p
[21:22] paulwe has joined the channel
[21:24] kurmangazy: I was pretty good with it 10 years or so ago, but that was with LILO. now it's GRUB, which looks way more complex. and I don't know anything about how VirtualBox works internally.
[21:24] kurmangazy: chjj: is arch or gentoo easier? or are you being facetious?
[21:25] mmalecki has joined the channel
[21:25] chjj: kurmangazy: i was joking, arch and gentoo are a bit more lowlevel than ubuntu ;)
[21:25] kurmangazy: ah. well, at least they probably ask you before blowing away your kernel. or whatever Ubuntu did.

[21:31] kurmangazy: I actually like building my own computer from parts. Apple is hostile to that.
[21:31] singintime: hello world
[21:32] |sWORDs|: ryanrolds: Node 0.5.9. In the old express.js there is a exports.createServer, which isn't in the 3.0 there is a function createApplication() but that's making connect 2.0 crash
[21:32] kurmangazy: chjj: forks and execs in Cygwin are *really* slow. I mean *really*. which really limits your ability to write shell scripts.
[21:32] ryanrolds: 0.5.x isn't supported
[21:32] jhbot: singintime, hello human :)
[21:33] ryanrolds: Express only supports 0.4.x atm.
[21:33] chjj: kurmangazy: eh, its still good for what it does, its a good project

[21:35] ryanrolds: The master branch currently is a work in progress.
[21:35] singintime: has anybody aleady done that?
[21:35] kurmangazy: chjj: it's the only game in town for what it does. but the speed boost when I switched to virtual linux was phenomenal.
[21:35] kurmangazy: chjj: I think the problems are with Windows. they are not CygWin's fault.

[21:36] |sWORDs|: ryanrolds: I've used github. visionmedia authored October 06, 2011 "node":">= 0.5.0 < 0.7.0"
[21:36] |sWORDs|: so I'm to early
[21:36] ryanrolds: Yes, but that is basically a nightly, no guarantee it will work.
[21:36] chjj: kurmangazy: all im saying is, if i were using windows, i would use cygwin, theres no point to me running a linux distro in a vm when i can just boot up linux on a real machine
[21:36] matyr has joined the channel
[21:36] ryanrolds: What happens when you run the tests tests for express?
[21:37] ryanrolds: I bet money a lot of them fail. ;)
[21:37] chjj: kurmangazy: id rather have something minimal
[21:37] |sWORDs|: It's kind of weird, because the old version works on 0.5.9 if change the package.json file and install it with npm locally
[21:37] ryanrolds: Um, if you worked you were exceptionally lucky.
[21:38] ryanrolds: *if it worked

[21:38] ryanrolds: The express archive should have a test/ dir.

[21:39] tlynn has joined the channel
[21:39] |sWORDs|: Maybe I should switch to cygwin then
[21:39] ryanrolds: Have you run npm install in the untared archive?

[21:39] ryanrolds: Or linux.
[21:39] ryanrolds: Linux would probably be the best route ;)
[21:40] kurmangazy: chjj: I like to tune my shell. Getting interesting kinds of bash completion to work fast in Cygwin, you had to avoid doing any kind of forks. You can do a lot in bash without forking, but it's really difficult.
[21:40] |sWORDs|: ryanrolds: The server will be linux, it's just the other dev that has never ever done anything with linnux
[21:40] ryanrolds: Fire that dev.

[21:42] ryanrolds: Did you use npm to install express from the tar or just extract it?
[21:42] |sWORDs|: but yes I've used npm
[21:42] javier_: hey ppl, just a little question: are node modules supported on windows? I see no note on the documentation against that. I successfully build my addon but it fails to load it
[21:42] kurmangazy: chjj: that said, even when you can use the completion scripts that come with Ubuntu, it doesn't work all that well. I kind of just gave up on getting decent completion.
[21:42] |sWORDs|: javier_: Most seem to work ok
[21:43] javier_: how? I get the error: TypeError: Object #<EventEmitter> has no method 'dlopen'
[21:43] javier_: when trying to require my addon module
[21:43] ryanrolds: You should beable to find express in the node_modules dir.
[21:43] kurmangazy: chjj: if you want to see slow, try using the full set of bash completion scripts
[21:43] ryanrolds: If you run npm install -d and run make test you should see the tests run.
[21:43] |sWORDs|: ryanrolds: Yes it's there, but there are no test files
[21:44] ryanrolds: My have been a bad download.
[21:45] |sWORDs|: express folder contains bin, lib and node_modules (which contains commander, connect, mime, mkdirp and qs)
[21:46] |sWORDs|: hmmm, it's npm that does not copy the test files in to node_modules, the zip has them
[21:48] shepherdsam has joined the channel
[21:48] |sWORDs|: express.test.js: Error: Cannot find module 'should'
[21:49] ryanrolds: You're right. In node_modules/express run npm install
[21:49] ryanrolds: May have to do do npm install -d
[21:49] ryanrolds: Er, if you had tests to run you would want to do -d.
[21:49] |sWORDs|: -d is development?
[21:50] ryanrolds: It installs the dev dependencies.
[21:50] |sWORDs|: So that's where the development deps are for, seen them in the package.json

[21:55] javier_: well the answer is no, C/C++ addon modules are not supported in windows, since dlopen() is not included in node heh, it will rock to add that information to the documentation
[21:55] ryanrolds: I'm trying the connect and express tests now.
[21:56] ryanrolds: Connect failed (I plan putting some work in to that this weekend), about to test express.
[21:56] ryanrolds: *plan on
[21:57] markdaws: is there any reliable way for JavaScript to know it is running in node?  An object/property that won't disappear at some point?  I have JS shared between the client and node and want  a way to know.  I was just checking for the existance of a global variable called exports, but that clashes with some object used in YUI toolkit
[21:57] ryanrolds: Until earlier this week expresso didn't even run on 0.5.9, so couldn't even run the tests. ;)
[21:57] kurmangazy: javier_: DLLs in windows work a bit different than so files in *nix
[21:58] javier_: sure, now i see in node.cc that process.dlopen is being included only under #ifdef __POSIX__
[21:58] mmalecki: Bradley Meck was working on node addons for windows
[21:59] mmalecki: he isn't around now, but checkout his fork
[21:59] ryanrolds: markdaws: Check 'process.versions.node'
[21:59] javier_: tnx, I will
[21:59] |sWORDs|: really hard to install -d, most dependencies also have node < 5.0
[21:59] markdaws: ryanrolds: Thanks, that looks pretty stable.
[22:00] ryanrolds: If it's not node, don't expect process or process.version to exist.
[22:01] ryanrolds: markdaws: Also process.version per http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.3.1/api/process.html#process.version
[22:02] kurmangazy: does javascript have any inherent limitations that are going to mess you up in node? I noticed that util.print() is really slow.
[22:02] kurmangazy: maybe it is unbuffered?

[22:03] DualDetroit: There is a *bug* in response.write(), I swear
[22:03] Brandon_R: has that problem been solved in any programming language?
[22:03] kurmangazy: Brandon_R: of computer books?
[22:03] Brandon_R: yep
[22:03] DualDetroit: Why the fuck does response.write() return FALSE?
[22:03] Brandon_R: or do u guys don't care about publishers and just buy a book that interests you?
[22:03] DualDetroit: Is node.js that buggy?
[22:03] Brandon_R: calm down
[22:04] DualDetroit: And of course, write NOTHING to the HTTP client
[22:04] Brandon_R: how is that a bug?
[22:04] kurmangazy: Brandon_R: obviously o'reilly and apress have a lot of good stuff, but I found that the authors are much more important
[22:04] javier_: that's a minimal response
[22:04] DualDetroit: Brandon_R: Because it doesn't work and I'm about to get yelled at for going over the deadline and now the whole project is *ffffcked*
[22:04] Brandon_R: ahh
[22:04] Brandon_R: maybe i can help
[22:04] Brandon_R: what is your problem?
[22:04] kurmangazy: Brandon_R: I look at the reviews a book has gotten on amazon
[22:05] Brandon_R: oreilly books has gotten bad
[22:05] Brandon_R: i mean 50-60 page books?
[22:05] SubStack: if write() returns false that means it's buffering
[22:05] AvianFlu: DualDetroit, what substack said
[22:05] SubStack: it has to do with backpressure from putting too much data through the connection
[22:06] AvianFlu: you need to wait for the 'drain' event on the connection to resume it
[22:06] SubStack: DualDetroit: if you use .pipe() then it will take care of all of the backpressure pause/resume logic

[22:09] |sWORDs|: ryanrolds: expresso, connect and jade still fail with npm, I'll try to do them manually
[22:09] Brandon_R_: the new books
[22:09] Brandon_R_: html5
[22:09] Brandon_R_: nodejs
[22:09] Brandon_R_: maybe its because they are new technologies
[22:10] Brandon_R_: in a couple months i expect they would be coming out with 300 page books
[22:10] kurmangazy: Brandon_R_: what are the titles?

[22:15] Brandon_R_: no
[22:15] Brandon_R_: you create it in flash

[22:15] Brandon_R_: http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/wallaby/
[22:15] JmZ: why would adobe make an app to convert flash to html?
[22:16] kurmangazy: oh. why would you use Flash at all, then?
[22:16] JmZ: isn't that like making their own product obsolete

[22:26] javier_: so, I've downloaded a copy of the branch "windowsdll" of the bmeck's node fork... someone with experience building node on windows??
[22:26] ryanolds_wrap: <- Work account
[22:26] |sWORDs|: just sended it you: express.test.js gives no errors, only that sys is now called util. But my code still gives: TypeError: Object function createApplication() {} has no method 'createServer'

[22:28] |sWORDs|: the same file worked with the old version, didn't change a line
[22:28] kurmangazy: javier_: I tried using gawk native-code extensions under cygwin, and building the extensions themselves gets tricky. the DLL can't have undefined symbols.
[22:28] javier_: yes
[22:28] DualDetroit: Sorry, got disconnected.
[22:28] javier_:   File "tools\gyp_node", line 20     print 'Error running GYP'        SyntaxError: invalid syntax             Failed to create vc project files.
[22:28] DualDetroit: Brandon_R_: Here is a test case: http://paste.scsys.co.uk/150515
[22:28] javier_: kurmangazy: sure, my dll is just the one in the documentation, has no underfined symbols
[22:28] ryanolds_wrap: Looks like Express doesn't support 0.5.9 yet.
[22:29] DualDetroit: request.write() is never working on line 17 there.
[22:29] Bonuspunkt: hmm i installed python and added it to the path variable
[22:29] kurmangazy: javier_: so the extension has already been built properly?
[22:29] javier_: I'm not a python coder heh
[22:29] DualDetroit: Err, response.write() is not working on line 17
[22:29] ryanolds_wrap: I know that TJ is working on updating his modules to 0.5.9, he commented it was going to take him 3 weeks to get all of them updated.
[22:29] javier_: sure, I compiled it fine
[22:30] DualDetroit: http://paste.scsys.co.uk/150515 -- Can someone please tell me what the hell is going on with response.write() to not work on the second time?
[22:30] DualDetroit: Is it a scope issue?
[22:30] kurmangazy: when I was trying to do it with gawk, I just gave up and started using virtual Linux. too much trouble for too little gain.
[22:30] javier_: with g++, the problem comes with the node binary (0.5.9), it says it doesn't contain the function dlopen() when I try to require my addon module, which makes sense since in the node.cc the dlopen function is defined under __POSIX__ define
[22:31] kurmangazy: javier_: what version of g++? cygwin, mingw? something else?
[22:31] javier_: sure, it's a simple problem really, but I'm stuck now trying to compile the node fork with dll support
[22:31] |sWORDs|: ryanolds_wrap: It does use zlib which wasn't in 0.5.7
[22:32] javier_: g++ 4.5.0
[22:32] kurmangazy: doesn't it have to be something like mingw?
[22:33] DualDetroit: ACTION should have never used node.js for a production project :<
[22:33] |sWORDs|: ryanolds_wrap: Anyway thanks for thinking with me, I'll go back to the "old" version and check again when 0.5.x is final and supported by express and connect

[22:33] ryanolds_wrap: |sWORDs|: Report the error you're getting: https://github.com/visionmedia/express/issues?sort=updated&direction=desc&state=open
[22:34] kurmangazy: DualDetroit: that's why it's the "bleeding edge"
[22:34] DualDetroit: |sWORDs|: See http://paste.scsys.co.uk/150515
[22:34] DualDetroit: Please help a noder :(
[22:34] javier_: oh can't tell about that, I compiled with "g++ -g -DEV_MULTIPLICITY=0 hello.cc -c -o hello.node"
[22:34] ryanolds_wrap: DualDetroit: Are you trying to run 0.5.x on production?
[22:35] javier_: in any case as soon as I get compiled the node with DLL support I will know if the addon is generated ok or not heh
[22:35] bnoordhuis: DualDetroit: you're doing a .write() in the 'end' listener, that won't work
[22:35] matyr has joined the channel

[22:36] DualDetroit: Nah, http
[22:37] bnoordhuis: DualDetroit: by the time you get the 'end' event, the connection's been closed
[22:37] ryanolds_wrap: Hum, does it have the same issue on 0.4.12/
[22:37] |sWORDs|: End is on closure
[22:37] pct has joined the channel
[22:37] JmZ: hmm
[22:38] javier_: I'm reinstalling VC++ 2010 Express just in case
[22:38] DualDetroit: bnoordhuis: So what's the correct event to check for to know when all the form data from the POST has been read in?
[22:38] bnoordhuis: DualDetroit: oh, and it's on the request object - i don't think request ever emits 'end'
[22:38] wbednarski has joined the channel
[22:38] DualDetroit: hmm
[22:38] bnoordhuis: DualDetroit: 'response'
[22:38] JmZ: im downloading a file via http.get, then on the data event, writing the chunks out to the client. so, in short, using the server as a sort of proxy to download a file. after testing it though, its clear that the memory usage increases by the size of the file, is there no way to only store the current chunk in memory?
[22:38] avih has joined the channel
[22:39] ryanolds_wrap: DualDetroit: bnoordhuis, is very likely right.
[22:40] DualDetroit: bnoordhuis: I am using request.addListener('end' so I know when it is done reading in the request body's form data.

[22:44] Industrial: JmZ: I can't mind read your problem :(
[22:44] Industrial: JmZ: try explaining.
[22:44] JmZ: try explaining? i wrote a huge paragraph up above

[22:46] |sWORDs|: JmZ: I did read it, I just don't have a clue
[22:46] JmZ: that's nice to know
[22:47] DualDetroit: Say I am doing the follow to read in POSTed form data: req.addListener("data", function(chunk) { 		req.content += chunk; 	});
[22:48] bnoordhuis: DualDetroit: sorry, i thought your example was a client
[22:48] DualDetroit: How do I know when I've read in everything?
[22:48] bnoordhuis: yes, request emits 'end'
[22:48] DualDetroit: bnoordhuis: Sorry, I should have been more clear :p
[22:48] avih has joined the channel
[22:49] mmalecki: ah. Server.prototype._doListen got removed, right?
[22:49] DualDetroit: bnoordhuis: So it's really weird that anything output from response.write() inside my 'end' listener function is not seen in the browser :-/
[22:49] bnoordhuis: DualDetroit: does it work with curl?
[22:50] JmZ: i think i get it, my problem
[22:50] DualDetroit: bnoordhuis: Trying...
[22:50] djbell has joined the channel
[22:50] bnoordhuis: DualDetroit: you never call response.writeHead() btw
[22:50] JmZ: it will download it faster than the client receives it, so the slower a client is, the more it has to store in memory until it is served
[22:50] DualDetroit: bnoordhuis: Why not?
[22:50] JmZ: however, if this is the case then im not sure of a way to avoid it
[22:50] ryanolds_wrap: JmZ: I would need to see the code to see if some odd assignment is happening. Have you tried piping the data between the streams?
[22:51] JmZ: what do you think of what i just said
[22:51] bnoordhuis: DualDetroit: i don't know why you don't call it :)
[22:52] amiller has joined the channel
[22:52] DualDetroit: bnoordhuis: Argh, I don't even have curl on my system :-/
[22:52] kurmangazy: JmZ: can't you refuse to accept the packets? say, pause the stream
[22:52] ryanolds_wrap: That would require some buffering, if you use .pipe() it should handle all of that for you, but I haven't check the memory footprint while piping data around.
[22:52] japj: mmalecki: you have a problem with node on windows using vows? (is there an issue in node that you are hitting?)
[22:52] DualDetroit: bnoordhuis: Oh, could that be why?
[22:52] mmalecki: JmZ: pipe the stream to client
[22:52] bnoordhuis: DualDetroit: probably
[22:52] JmZ: ryanolds_wrap: i originally wanted to use pipe() but i wasn't sure how
[22:52] DualDetroit: hmm
[22:52] JmZ: mmalecki too
[22:52] mmalecki: japj: yeah. some weird socket stuff when writing to console (?)
[22:53] mmalecki: japj: I will look into it later
[22:53] mmalecki: windows makes me unhappy
[22:53] AvianFlu: japj: there's no /dev/null on windows, that's ultimately the problem
[22:53] japj: mmalecki: atleast submit the issue to github if it's not already known
[22:53] JmZ: download_response.pipe(client_response) or something?
[22:53] mmalecki: no, that was quite easy to figure out actually
[22:53] AvianFlu: oh, what's the problem now?
[22:54] mmalecki: I just set stdout.write to noop
[22:54] mmalecki: not sure
[22:54] AvianFlu: I figured you'd do that
[22:54] AvianFlu: okay, I'll start testing it myself in a little
[22:54] tauren has joined the channel
[22:54] mmalecki: I'll look into it tomorrow, windows is slow on my laptop
[22:54] DualDetroit: bnoordhuis: Didn't help :-/
[22:54] AvianFlu: japj this is high on our priorities list, cause getting the test runner ported willl help port other things
[22:54] japj: AvianFlu: I thought windows had a NUL device
[22:54] mmalecki: so it makes me 2x unhappy
[22:54] AvianFlu: japj he solved that problem, I'm just a little behind
[22:54] mmalecki: japj: still, that's a hac
[22:54] mmalecki: *hack
[22:55] mmalecki: I will write a npm module to emulate all sort of /dev/* thingies, I think
[22:55] JmZ: ahh
[22:55] JmZ: this is better
[22:55] DualDetroit: Still not working: http://paste.scsys.co.uk/150517
[22:55] avih has joined the channel
[22:55] ryanolds_wrap: JmZ: It's unintuitively easy. readableStream.pipe(writableStream);
[22:56] JmZ: mmalecki, ryanolds_wrap: pipe seems to have resolved the problem
[22:56] DualDetroit: Could there be a bug with node.js?
[22:56] javier_: damn, reinstalling VC++ 2010 Express didn't help, seems a problem with that GYP crap
[22:56] japj: mmalecki AvianFlu isn't it something that should be in node or libuv eventually?
[22:56] JmZ: yeah i know ryanolds_wrap i noticed above
[22:56] mmalecki: is there some direct equivalent of net.Server.prototype._doListen in 0.6?
[22:56] mmalecki: japj: well, maybe...
[22:56] ryanolds_wrap: ^_^
[22:56] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: ^ ?
[22:57] bnoordhuis: mmalecki: what do you need it for?
[22:57] javier_: seems to be a python version problem, it says "invalid syntax" into what seems to be valid python code
[22:57] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: piping my stuff to black hole
[22:57] japj: javier_: what version of python are you using?
[22:58] bnoordhuis: DualDetroit: can you gist your full script?
[22:58] javier_: python 3.1.2
[22:58] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: like, child's stdout and things.
[22:58] tauren: If I want to execute the following command from within a node script, how would I do it using spawn?  
[22:58] DualDetroit: bnoordhuis: okay
[22:58] tauren: jade < myfile.jade > myfile.html
[22:58] markwubben has joined the channel
[22:58] mmalecki: tauren: don't. jade has an api.
[22:59] tauren: mmalecki: sure, but i'm using it as an example. other scripts don't have an api.
[22:59] bnoordhuis: mmalecki: i don't understand why you need to bind for that
[22:59] bnoordhuis: mmalecki: but there's ._listen2
[23:00] bnoordhuis: that's for server sockets btw
[23:00] javier_: now, it seems there are 2 different pythons out there, the 2.x and the 3.x ... a little rant: having to be a python hacker to build node sucks

[23:02] DualDetroit: bnoordhuis: Here it is: https://gist.github.com/1290287
[23:02] tauren: mmalecki: thanks, i've been looking at the 0.4.12 docs, but I'm not understanding how to "pipe child's stdout to file stream"
[23:02] AvianFlu: child.stdout.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(filename))
[23:02] tauren: AvianFlu: ah, cool. thanks!
[23:02] AvianFlu: yeah, stream.pipe() is gangster
[23:03] AvianFlu: most of the time, you want to be using it
[23:03] DualDetroit: bnoordhuis: There's some ugly code, but the relevant part starts at line 128
[23:03] mmalecki: SubStack wrote a stoppable one
[23:03] AvianFlu: or, you wish you didn't have to do complicated thing X so that you could just .pipe() it
[23:03] SubStack: mmalecki: haha I just took the lib/stream.js out of node and put a return cleanup at the end
[23:03] mmalecki: would be cool if pipe had a filter or something
[23:04] tauren: great, thanks for the help guys
[23:04] mmalecki: SubStack: still, that's cool :)
[23:04] AvianFlu: I think mikeal's streams2 had something like that

[23:05] japj:   print 'Error running GYP'?
[23:05] DualDetroit: bnoordhuis: Okay
[23:05] javier_: japj: yes
[23:06] DualDetroit: bnoordhuis: I will look at that on github :)
[23:06] japj: javier_: that is because python 3.x changed print to a function
[23:07] javier_: I see
[23:08] cafesofie has joined the channel
[23:09] javier_: I installed Python 2.7.2 now and I'm trying to get it working
[23:09] kurmangazy: has anyone played with XML parsing?
[23:10] AvianFlu: I wrote an XML parser in perl 5 years ago XD
[23:10] kurgangazy_ has joined the channel
[23:11] kurmangazy: AvianFlu: from scratch?
[23:11] AvianFlu: yeah
[23:11] AvianFlu: I was using one with a really, really, really shitty api
[23:11] kurgangazy_: what was it like?
[23:11] AvianFlu: so eventually I said "fuck that"
[23:11] catb0t has joined the channel
[23:11] AvianFlu: well here's the thing
[23:12] AvianFlu: if you just need to parse a straightforward tag structure, it's easy
[23:12] AvianFlu: but there's a lot to xml if you start trying to rfc yourself
[23:12] japj: javier_: apparently gyp python3 support has been a long known issue already http://code.google.com/p/gyp/issues/detail?id=36&q=python (from 2009)
[23:12] stagas has joined the channel
[23:12] kurmangazy: yeah, the devil's in the details
[23:12] AvianFlu: so I basically read the RFC and gave up
[23:12] japj: javier_: so far for python3 being used with gyp much
[23:12] AvianFlu: but the use case I built it for - easy parsing of simple xml structures another script was making - it was easy
[23:13] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[23:14] kurmangazy: AvianFlu: I have been trying to make XML parsing easy. I started writing an extension to gawk that would let you parse XML in a sane way. I didn't start from scratch, though. I was using libxml2
[23:14] AvianFlu: polotek was trying to port that to node
[23:14] AvianFlu: it was apparently a moderate nightmare, if I remember correctly
[23:14] kurmangazy: port what, libxml2?
[23:14] AvianFlu: bind it, not port it, really
[23:14] AvianFlu: i.e. wrap it in a c++ extension
[23:15] ag4ve_ has joined the channel
[23:15] kurmangazy: I am using the libxmljs extension. is that polotek's? it seems to work
[23:15] AvianFlu: he put a lot of work into it, I'd imagine it's pretty solid
[23:15] ryanolds_wrap: I may just be crazy, and maybe it already does this, but it would be nifty if you could pipe, but still consume the data event and manipulate the data before it gets written out.
[23:15] AvianFlu: I just know it presented a lot of complications
[23:16] kurmangazy: AvianFlu: I am only using the SAX part. the other stuff is too heavy and unnecessary.
[23:17] ryanolds_wrap: I end up getting data from a socket and piping it out an response and it would be nice if I could streaming gzip the incoming data before it's written out to the client.
[23:18] vincentmac has joined the channel
[23:18] ryanolds_wrap: *out an HTTP response
[23:18] kurmangazy: AvianFlu: for my gawk extension, first I implemented the tree. then I realized it was reading the whole document into memory, so I reimplemented it with the reader. Then I realized that it was going to make memory management really difficult. So I was getting ready to reimplement a third time using SAX.
[23:18] brianc has joined the channel
[23:18] AvianFlu: yeah, welcome to the problem
[23:19] AvianFlu: a universally useful parser is severely non-trivial
[23:19] AvianFlu: one use case, easy problem
[23:20] javier_: ok, I got the node.exe finally built with Python 2.7.2 installed
[23:20] kurmangazy: AvianFlu: I am trying to make the problem better. I'm creating an API for node on top of SAX.
[23:20] javier_: and when trying to load the hello.node it says it's not a valid win32 app which is true by what I see in a hex editor heh
[23:21] javier_: so my building attempt with g++ was wrong
[23:21] Guest2282 has joined the channel
[23:21] japj: javier_: are you trying to build a c++ addon for windows?
[23:22] javier_: yap
[23:22] japj: piscisaureus: do you know if it is possible to build c++ addons for node on windows yet?
[23:23] kurmangazy: AvianFlu: there are already a number of choices for what to build on, though. different flavors of expat, libxmljs, others...
[23:23] javier_: I guess it should, what I was compiling was the node's fork of bmeck (branch windowsdll), that by what I see in the source code, is calling LoadLibrary in the process.dlopen() which is correct
[23:24] javier_: the error that I'm getting now, suggest it is working ok (it failed to load a non valid w32 dll)
[23:25] kurmangazy: javier_: like I said, building the DLL is not trivial
[23:26] skm has joined the channel
[23:26] javier_: sure, now that I reinstalled VS I will try using that
[23:27] trotter has joined the channel
[23:27] AvianFlu: kurmangazy, you can, and you should, for sure
[23:27] AvianFlu: I'm just sharing my experience of the problem
[23:27] AvianFlu: five years ago in perl, I didn't have incentive to finish solving it
[23:27] AvianFlu: you, now, may
[23:28] piscisaureus: japj: it itsn't - yet
[23:28] kurmangazy: AvianFlu: what I'm doing is different. I'm using an existing SAX parser.
[23:28] piscisaureus: addons are a special kind of problem
[23:28] kurmangazy: AvianFlu: I'm just trying to give it a better API.
[23:28] AvianFlu: oh.
[23:29] AvianFlu: well that you should definitely be able to do
[23:29] kurmangazy: someone wrote a parser in pure javascript, but it used a lot of memory and was slow
[23:29] AvianFlu: not surprising
[23:30] kurmangazy: there's no point in reinventing the wheel.
[23:30] kurmangazy: if you can't do it better.
[23:30] AvianFlu: true

[23:31] Brandon_R_: hi
[23:32] Brandon_R_: anyone got an example of how to build a c++ addon on node
[23:32] Brandon_R_: or libev
[23:32] Brandon_R_: using libuv
[23:32] Brandon_R_: or libeio
[23:32] Brandon_R_: so many libs
[23:32] AvianFlu: how's your c?
[23:33] AvianFlu: the first advice given on the subject at node camp was "Don't."

[23:40] smtlaissezfaire has joined the channel
[23:42] hotch has joined the channel
[23:43] AvianFlu: no, but there are some examples floating around
[23:44] AvianFlu: there was a big conversation about them at node conf summer camp a month or so ago
[23:44] AvianFlu: there are a lot of complications involved
[23:44] AvianFlu: and crossing from JS to C is an expensive thing to do
[23:44] AvianFlu: C/C++ I should say
[23:44] AvianFlu: the v8 API is where you really need to start
[23:44] AvianFlu: it's a lot of templatey C++
[23:45] AvianFlu: overloaded -> and *
[23:45] AvianFlu: stuff like that
[23:46] stagas has joined the channel
[23:46] kurmangazy: I'd much rather deal with a competently-designed interface in C over C++

[23:50] DennisRasmussen has joined the channel
[23:51] AvianFlu: yeah, C++ has its uses, but I really like C as well kurmangazy 
[23:52] AvianFlu: the stuff they do with templates, though, would probably be more complicated in C
[23:52] AvianFlu: they being v8
[23:52] AvianFlu: v8 does a lot of crazy shit that's beyond my pay grade
[23:53] kurmangazy: when I'm trying to code something in an OOP language, I find myself spending time trying to come up with some sort of beautiful class architecture, instead of trying to solve actual problems.
[23:53] tmzt: kurmangazy: be nice to have a choice, I would probably have written a few native things if it allowed them to be written in c as well as c++
[23:54] tmzt: there's already libffi though
[23:54] AvianFlu: I like prototypes in JS for that reason, kurmangazy 
[23:54] AvianFlu: also... I *think* you could write C and then only write your glue in C++
[23:54] AvianFlu: for a node extension
[23:55] Brandon_R_: so
[23:55] Brandon_R_: any of those examples floating around u can point me too
[23:55] Brandon_R_: tried googling
[23:55] Brandon_R_: just hello world examples and no libuv
[23:56] kurmangazy: AvianFlu: I haven't made up my mind on whether prototypes make the situation better
[23:56] AvianFlu: https://github.com/joyent/libuv readme Brandon_R_ ?
[23:56] Brandon_R_: woah
[23:56] AvianFlu: kurmangazy, less thinking than classes if you need instances of something
[23:56] Brandon_R_: why is my name Brandon_R_
[23:56] AvianFlu: you probably disconnected
[23:56] AvianFlu: and your other name hadn't timed out yet
[23:57] kurmangazy: I haven't written lots of js, but getting rid of classes and interfaces has got to be a big improvement
[23:57] AvianFlu: old-school, lamentable IRC problem
[23:57] AvianFlu: kurmangazy, prototypical inheritance is simpler
[23:57] AvianFlu: you have your "constructor", basically just a function that gives you a new whatever, and then prototype properties and methods
[23:57] AvianFlu: make a new one, it has them already
[23:57] AvianFlu: don't expose what you don't want to expose
[23:58] AvianFlu: still an object, less thinking
[23:58] Tprice: when i post multipart/form-data from node to php what encode should my files be?
[23:58] AvianFlu: application/json?
[23:58] kurmangazy: but is that an improvement over a weakly-typed procedural language, like PHP (without classes)
[23:58] Tprice: should it be base64?
[23:58] AvianFlu: I'd rather write JS than PHP, any day
[23:58] AvianFlu: JS is much more functional
[23:59] AvianFlu: prototypes in particular might not give you much over php, but JS, I think, does
[23:59] kurmangazy: that's true. PHP doesn't have much functional features.
[23:59] AvianFlu: functions as first class objects is one of the big wins
[23:59] AvianFlu: really, really cheap recursion among other things, compared to some other languages/vms
