[00:00] Clex: devaholic: sure, but this error is likely a version mismatch or some shit according to Google.
[00:00] neorab: ok, I might give this a shot for him... I think where I expect that there will be issues is with modules that install needing things like waf
[00:01] Pathin has joined the channel
[00:03] neorab: we've got a good 10ish modules that our app depends on, plus all of their dependancies... I am sure he'd have no problem logging issues against them if something doesn't work, but in the mean time he's gonna use a VM, already got it running there

[02:07] Marak: without inferring that indices of numerical values are arrays?
[02:07] Marak: i think impossible perhaps
[02:07] insin: depends how you're putting them on there in the first place. I use forms which allow me to prefix multiple instances with something unique, then each form knows exactly which params it needs to look at to grab its input
[02:08] Marak: huh?

[03:41] swilson06: blueadept: btw, if you look at the node.js there are only like 8 modules and only 2 or 3 with any documentation and that look decent. that should trim down your question a bit

[03:44] blueadept: yeah that's my thought as well

[03:45] MetaMucil has joined the channel

[03:46] blueadept: yeah i use mongo a lot, using mongoose and mongolian
[03:46] swilson06: well, maybe mongoose will beat node and mongo because mongoose is a smaller project, but...
[03:46] blueadept: but the next app i'm working on involves inventory and transactions
[03:47] blueadept: there are ways of doing it with mongo
[03:47] blueadept: but it takes writing more app logic to ensure consistency and rollbacks
[03:48] Peniar has joined the channel
[03:48] blueadept: where as that type of logic is built into sql dbs
[03:49] blueadept: i found this article on two-phase commits in mongo though, http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/two-phase+commit
[03:49] blueadept: so maybe i'll try it out
[03:55] swilson06: hey, nice article, thanks for the heads up :)

[04:37] jesusabdullah: ABI?

[06:07] swilson06: just preference. i like ejs because it is more like perl's template toolkit
[06:07] Nexxy: there is no structure
[06:08] swilson06: it forces a style on you. don't like that
[06:09] devaholic: ejs ++
[06:09] swilson06: same reason i don't like python
[06:09] devaholic: -1 jade
[06:09] jesusabdullah: YOU're a structure!
[06:09] devaholic: writing native html is superior
[06:09] devaholic: writing native javascript inline is superior
[06:09] Nexxy: lol...
[06:09] jesusabdullah: swilson06: I assume you're talking about the whitespace.
[06:09] swilson06: ACTION is a stiff structure
[06:09] devaholic: i wish HTML was indent-aware
[06:09] jesusabdullah: The whitespace thing I think effects structure very little.

[06:09] Nexxy: devaholic, take that back
[06:10] devaholic: and thats just how it is
[06:10] Nexxy: you take that back right now
[06:10] jesusabdullah: That's right devaholic html is irritating enough to deal with and now you have to throw in crap like that :(
[06:10] jesusabdullah: ;)
[06:10] devaholic: i understand the intentions of jade
[06:10] devaholic: and ive used it (a lot)
[06:10] jesusabdullah: I'm not nearly as big a python fan as I used to be, but I dislike it mostly for reasons unrelated to TWT
[06:11] swilson06: twt?
[06:12] jesusabdullah: the whitespace thing
[06:13] swilson06: btw, most people that have worked with code like python because other devs can't fuck it up - it forces you to do sane code. i think i write sane code anyway and can deal with python (and probably jade) but i don't like style being enforced
[06:13] jesusabdullah: Ugh, that's so untrue
[06:13] jesusabdullah: python's fine if you are only working within "nice" domains
[06:13] jesusabdullah: but as soon as you want to do something interesting you have to hack at it to make it do whatever it is
[06:14] jesusabdullah: They make it hard to do interesting things
[06:14] jesusabdullah: and when you complain about that, they tell you to be less ambitious.
[06:14] swilson06: well, i don't do python so i don't know :)
[06:14] jbpros has joined the channel
[06:14] swilson06: though, that is probably a good reason they don't seem to have an event handler

[06:15] jesusabdullah: What do you mean, no event handler?
[06:16] swilson06: heh, nevermind. quick google turns out pyev...
[06:16] jesusabdullah: There are a lot of event loops and/or async tools for python
[06:16] jesusabdullah: the problem is that they mostly suck

[10:26] fille: need to addEventlistener
[10:28] jasonhulme: I am using a method that expects an instream (e.g. fs.createReadStream('foo.txt')) but my file does not exist on disc, how do I convert a string to an instream?
[10:30] t4nk441: I played with node.js for a couple of minutes of found a blocker for me. You really need fast and well-behaving callbacks. If one callback isn't fast enough, or takes to long, or is even in a non-terminating loop, the server is blocked and new requests aren't handled. With a complex and big site this can easily happen and finding it might take a long time. Am I missing something here?
[10:30] markwubben has joined the channel
[10:31] fille: t4nk441 did u use the express.js?
[10:31] kmox83 has joined the channel
[10:31] t4nk441: i guess that make no difference since the server is blocked running a callback
[10:32] fille: well the server will be blocked until reaching  res.end()
[10:32] t4nk441: exactly
[10:32] robi42 has joined the channel
[10:33] fille: if u whant to make a webchat
[10:33] t4nk441: and if the callback screws thing up the server is bloked
[10:33] fille: you should use the socket.io
[10:33] t4nk441: i just play with it. no project in mind
[10:33] fille: i guess u trying an infinte loop inside your callback
[10:33] t4nk441: yes
[10:34] t4nk441: can happen
[10:34] fille: well u are making a webserver statefull
[10:34] t4nk441: or a long calculation at the wrong spot
[10:34] t4nk441: no
[10:34] t4nk441: just think of a sql query
[10:35] fille: u have to consult the pros
[10:35] t4nk441: and you try to do something with the result before you deliver it
[10:35] cognominal_ has joined the channel
[10:35] fille: i dont think the server will be blocked for everyone only the user
[10:36] t4nk441: no, tried it, blocked completely
[10:36] fille: the sql query?
[10:36] t4nk441: actually, what I expected
[10:36] t4nk441: not with a query
[10:36] fille: with your loop then?
[10:36] t4nk441: just a simple loop that takes long in the callback but terminates
[10:37] t4nk441: and the server does not answer for that period
[10:37] fille: yes the loop is not ascyn
[10:37] t4nk441: exactly
[10:37] t4nk441: but this actually kills it
[10:37] t4nk441: because a simple bug, somewhere, and you have it

[10:40] t4nk441: I am working with an application that is doing something similar. Select loop with timeout. And we have exactly that situation sometimes.

[21:25] TheEmpath: so contet delivery in node.js
[21:25] TheEmpath: a solved problem yet?
[21:26] TheEmpath: some context!
[21:26] TheEmpath: lets say i have an html5 graphic engine and a node.js server that allows people to sync in real time whatever they are doing in the engine
[21:26] TheEmpath: it uses a heavy amount of sprite sheets which can update at any time
[21:27] TheEmpath: there are three philosophical roads i've discovered when addressing this issue: all at once, on demand, or priority packaging
[21:27] TheEmpath: all at once gives the player everything, but initilaization times are awful
[21:27] killfill: there could be a little middleware that catch the file.html been served, read it, detect loaded javascript, and uglyfy the output to file.html.js or something and modify the .html file to load the uglyfied js.. :P
[21:28] TheEmpath: on demand allows players to get whatever they want when they need it, but you run the risk of having content inaccessible while the sprites are downloading
[21:28] TheEmpath: priority packaging gets specifically what is needed when the player enters a certain part, then silently downloads everything else over time

[21:28] captain_morgan has joined the channel
[21:28] TheEmpath: the problem with that is art people and programmers will have problems maintaining packages
[21:29] TheEmpath: and all of this might be moot given how cache.manifest works... where if the manifest updates, everything gets downloaded again
[21:29] dreamdust: You just need to package all your resources up into a single resource prior to delivering your response.

[23:20] Aria: It's an interactive UI pattern, not something you can do on a server.

[23:21] Aria: And in the handle part, people try to keep web logic apart from business logic. Which is smart, but doesn't make it MVC.

[23:49] sorensen: >.<
[23:49] rhdoenges: put it in your home dir
[23:50] rhdoenges: but do `./configure`
[23:50] rhdoenges: err ./configure --prefix=/usr
[23:50] rhdoenges: then make
[23:50] rhdoenges: and make install
[23:50] rhdoenges: and everything will be where it should be.

[23:52] arlolra: isaacs: a few weeks ago, you and mjr were discussing a weird problem with osx 10.6.8 and fstat ... did that ever get resolved?
[23:53] isaacs: arlolra: the answer was to rebuild node.
[23:53] isaacs: arlolra: not sure how it gets into that state.
[23:53] arlolra: i did that bunch of times on v0.5.1 and it never fixed ... i reverted to v0.4.9 and worked
[23:55] arlolra: i guess i can't move forward? :(
