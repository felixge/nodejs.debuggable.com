[00:00] davidbanham has joined the channel
[00:00] rob16299: and thats what they support, we dont do linux dev at my company
[00:00] mmalecki: node.js has a native windows build now. please use it.
[00:00] rob16299: i tried it
[00:01] rob16299: doesnt work on my engine, and they wont provide support for windows
[00:01] alejandromg: OH! 
[00:01] defunctzombie: who won't provide support?
[00:01] Sorella has joined the channel
[00:01] rob16299: the sdk company that we're using to write apps for
[00:01] mmalecki: hahahahahaha
[00:01] defunctzombie: what sdk for what engine? it sound to me like your are trying to use technologies that are not meant for the platforms
[00:01] mmalecki: tell them to gtfo
[00:02] mmalecki: that's what a sane company would do
[00:02] mmalecki: or get a linux
[00:02] marcello3d: so you have to use windows, but you can't use windows?
[00:02] defunctzombie: in which case I think you will find it very hard to find anyone to support you
[00:02] marcello3d: that sounds confusing
[00:02] rob16299: i know it all sounds weird, but thats where Im at, not the boss
[00:02] defunctzombie: why do you want to use node?
[00:02] mmalecki: that's called vendor lockin.
[00:02] defunctzombie: and what were you using before?
[00:02] marcello3d: it sounds like whatever library you're using isn't designed for windows?
[00:03] rob16299: have to, thats how development is done on their platform, then its pushed to their servers
[00:03] marcello3d: since it's using exec to check for root privileges (poorly designed?)
[00:03] defunctzombie: without more details there isn't much help we can give
[00:03] rob16299: i can give you all the details of what its trying to do
[00:03] cainus: hey all... can anyone recommend a hosting company where I can deploy via some method other than version control?
[00:03] rob16299: utils.info("Server running at http://localhost:" + gServerPort + "/" );
[00:03] defunctzombie: and sticking to node 0.4x isn't smart as no one will really support that now
[00:03] alejandromg: *Show the details*
[00:03] defunctzombie: cainus: depends how you want to deploy
[00:04] rob16299: Create Flash socket policy file server if running as root.
[00:04] rob16299: exec('id -G | sed -E "s/ .*//g"', function(serror, stdout, stderr)
[00:04] mmalecki: cainus: nodejitsu
[00:04] alejandromg: nodejitsu +1
[00:04] defunctzombie: rob16299 these are not details
[00:04] cainus: defunctzombie: ftp or scp?  can't really think of anything else
[00:04] rob16299: what do you need?
[00:04] defunctzombie: rsync :)
[00:05] defunctzombie: rob16299: what is it that you are trying to use?
[00:05] cainus: rsync is a little bit troublesome in this scenario
[00:05] defunctzombie: and why are you trying to make it work on cygwin instead of a linux system?
[00:05] MooGoo: all that exec does is go out of its way to check if you are root
[00:05] MooGoo: just dont check on windows
[00:05] defunctzombie: I know you said your company doesn't do windows
[00:05] cainus: isn't nodejitsu under private beta?
[00:06] rob16299: i am using node to host a local server to debug and develop a mobage application https://developer.mobage.com/
[00:06] mmalecki: cainus: yeah, but we can get you in in no time
[00:06] alejandromg: cainus: join the irc channel of nodejitsu and ask #nodejitsu
[00:06] mmalecki: dislaimer: I work for nodejitsu
[00:06] alejandromg: LOL
[00:06] rob16299: so work around it and not call exec?
[00:07] rob16299: ill give it a shot
[00:08] alejandromg: Yeah! BTW what sdk features do you need to write code?
[00:08] alejandromg: *js code
[00:08] rob16299: they have helpers for physics, touch handling, sprites, etc
[00:08] marcello3d: is it safe on node master to just copy the built exec to /usr/local/bin/node, or do I need to do more to mimick the old 'make install' ?
[00:08] rob16299: our company is helping them make applications for their sdk
[00:09] marcello3d: rob: tell them node 0.6.x is out with windows compatibility and they should support windows now
[00:09] marcello3d: without cygwin
[00:10] alejandromg: what marcello said,,,
[00:10] marcello3d: their docs say "Windows users must install a shell environment (e.g., Cygwin). We do not support Windows, because node.js is still unstable on Windows. "
[00:10] marcello3d: which isn't true anymore

[03:30] Aria: And found one bug in either the html5lib test data or the spec.
[03:30] ryah: Aria: 500? dang
[03:31] Aria: Yeah. The HTML5 parser has a huge test suite (thanks, HTML5lib!), and there's all kinds of crazy edge cases.
[03:31] Aria: I'm in the pile where it's stuff like "what happens if you have a < at the end of file inside an unclosed <script> tag"
[03:31] ryah: :)
[03:32] ryah: btw is html5 working on node v0.6?
[03:32] Aria: It is!
[03:32] ryah: excellent
[03:32] ryah: was porting it any trouble?
[03:32] Aria: And tmpvar just fixed the "sys is now util" name change that made it throw warnings.
[03:32] Aria: None. I don't touch any of the layers you changed.
[03:32] ryah: good - glad to hear.
[03:32] Aria: The parser is almost pure javascript goodness, the only nodiness is two event emitters.
[03:33] Aria: (well, and require)
[03:33] defunctzombie: how is html5 speed these days?
[03:33] Aria: Getting slowly better.
[03:33] defunctzombie: I tried it a month ago and libxml out performed it by a lot
[03:33] Aria: Well, yeah. XML parsing is far easier than HTML parsing ;-)
[03:33] defunctzombie: well, libxml does html as well ;)
[03:33] Aria: Kinda.
[03:33] defunctzombie: it is what I use to scrape webpages
[03:34] Aria: I'd be curious to know what it does in some of these edge cases.
[03:34] defunctzombie: http://xmlsoft.org/
[03:34] defunctzombie: it is complex tech, but you can certainly try it and see what the toString on the document produces
[03:34] defunctzombie: that is a fixed up version
[03:34] defunctzombie: what edge case do you have in mind?
[03:35] defunctzombie: I can run a quick test on one
[03:35] Aria: Oh, ones like < at EOF inside <script>
[03:35] Aria: I have hundreds to choose from.
[03:35] Aria: (Literally. 2400 assertions in the test suite and growing.)
[03:35] defunctzombie: can you paste a full example of the < at EOF?

[03:37] dilvie has joined the channel
[03:37] cainus: just wondering if people are really rendering on both the client and server (in the same app)
[03:38] defunctzombie: so after parsing that, I can tostring the document and get <html><head><script/></head></html>
[03:38] defunctzombie: while not valid html as a string (obviously cause of the script)
[03:38] defunctzombie: it is parsed properly
[03:38] defunctzombie: which means I can then do xpath lookups and the same just fine
[03:39] defunctzombie: Aria, ignore what I just said
[03:39] defunctzombie: I forgot a > before the last <
[03:39] defunctzombie: libxml2 does indeed give me the result you expected

[03:39] Aria: Aha. So it's not HTML5 parsing, but it's doing a sane tag soup.
[03:39] defunctzombie: it has been battle tested for a long time
[03:40] Aria: Yeah, it's really good software. I've used it for years.
[03:40] kurtzhong_ has joined the channel
[03:40] Aria: I have some ideas on how to speed the HTML5 parser up. Some is accounting for the ways in which V8 hates being abused as compared to others.
[03:40] defunctzombie: heh
[03:40] Aria: I suspect I'm triggering a recompile when I switch states.
[03:41] defunctzombie: speedup would be quite nice
[03:41] defunctzombie: I ported some of my stuff I had to html5 to try it
[03:41] defunctzombie: but had to switch back to libxml wrapper
[03:41] defunctzombie: for the speed
[03:41] defunctzombie: cause I do a lot of parsing on the fly
[03:41] t0mmyvyo has joined the channel
[03:41] defunctzombie: and can't really justify blocking for too long
[03:41] Aria: Yeah. I'm going to finish stomping a few of these correctness bugs, and then go for speed. I also need to see if using some of the weaker DOM modes speeds parsing. And then see if I can get private APIs that are fast.
[03:41] Aria: Yeah, my initial use case for this needs speed too.
[03:42] Aria: (haven't gotten there yet, obviously)
[03:42] defunctzombie: no worries, I am sure you will
[03:42] defunctzombie: the testcases will help keep you honest ;)
[03:42] Aria: Yes they do.
[03:42] Aria: I just want to squish the EOF misparsing errors before I go for speed.
[03:43] Aria: I found a way to get an exception thrown at the critical code points, so I'm tracking those down now.
[03:43] sdwrage has joined the channel
[03:43] Aria: ... Actually, I think I just nailed the last one unless the test suite is lying to me.

[04:05] defunctzombie: yea.. that kinda isn't useful for an end user :)
[04:05] defunctzombie: I know it may be a cool intermediate format, but that isn't the goal with documentation
[04:06] alejandromg: I was thinking about install a previous version, so you can get the .html output, i guess

[04:34] Pritchard: Hello.  Can someone explain to me or provide a link as to how server-side javascript gets executed?
[04:34] rob16299: worked with ubuntu, everyone have a nice night
[04:34] Pritchard: I want to know what processes my code, where and how information is being stored, and how communication with the system is accomplished.
[04:35] Pritchard: Because what I hear about node.js defies what I (currently) know about JavaScript - where I can't touch anything outside of the browser.  Obviously, I've only ever done client-side programming with JavaScript...
[04:35] Aria: Pritchard: node is a single binary program, linking in v8 -- it's the entry point that loads the script and runs it.
[04:36] dgathright has joined the channel
[04:36] kriszyp has joined the channel
[04:36] Aria: Pritchard: So it acts like almost any unix scripting engine. It runs the script, and sets up globals that let it load other modules that can do things like talk to the file system. So it's javascript language, but unbolted from the DOM and bolted onto a very efficient network stack instead.
[04:36] marcello3d: Pritchard: server-side javascript has almost nothing to do with client side javascript, other than the language itself
[04:36] gkatsev: and the js engine
[04:36] Pritchard: Thanks for the clarification.
[04:37] bradleymeck has joined the channel
[04:37] Aria: Pritchard: then, for serving web pages, people either have their browsers talk to the node script running an http server itself, or proxy that behind another web server.
[04:37] cure_ has joined the channel
[04:37] Pritchard: I have a professor who thinks there's no such thing as server-side javascript.  Us both using it on the client-side, the concept is admittedly a little intimidating.
[04:37] Aria: (that's a key point: you start the server first, it's not initiated by the client.)
[04:37] instafire has joined the channel
[04:37] Pritchard: Aria:  Thanks a ton.
[04:38] Aria: Oh dear. Your professor could have checked that with a quick google search. Server side javascript has existed since the days of netscape 3.
[04:38] Aria: (not that it was any good until recently.)
[04:38] Pritchard: :)
[04:38] Pritchard: I'm going to build an example and shove it in his cocky face.
[04:38] Pritchard: >_>...
[04:38] Aria: Excellent. Some of the realtime chat demos are both impressive and simple.
[04:38] Aria: "And look! It's javascript at both ends!"

[04:49] josephg: haha

[04:52] Pritchard: lol
[04:52] Pritchard: The world of business programming scares me a bit!
[04:53] josephg: we were a java shop, and my boss was scared of adding functions to any of the shared libraries (We'll have to re-test all our sites!)

[04:58] maxogden: Pritchard: your best bet is to build up your github account. you will get job offers like crazy
[04:58] changbeer: Pritchard, there is no shame in lying to a recruiter, as long as when you have the interview with you are honest, recruiter = stupid scum

[04:59] josephg: lduros: can you just use the builtin url.parse? http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.12/api/url.html
[04:59] changbeer: a recruiter will lie lie if there is a possibility you will earn him a commission, but he will put many candidates to increase his odds, even if it means you taking a day off work and travelling 2 hundreds mile to find that this super position is really maintaining an app in VB6
[05:00] changbeer: a recruiter skill is being so slimey so you feel you owe him, even to point of taking a job you're not 100% sold on, the lesson are learnt quickly, you owe them nothing, they are not your friends, they are market expoliters and nowadays they do so little work that the industry is a joke
[05:01] marcello3d: can't say I've ever interacted with a recruiter like you describe...
[05:01] Aria: YES
[05:01] lduros: josephg: thanks, looking into it :-)
[05:01] josephg: lduros:  :)
[05:01] changbeer: have you turned down a job after a 2nd interview? 
[05:01] marcello3d: but most of the recruiters I've talked to worked for whatever company was recruiting
[05:01] Aria: Oh, that's different.
[05:01] Aria: Third party recruiters are terrible.
[05:01] changbeer: yes very different
[05:01] josephg: I just don't see the point of 3rd party recruiters. There's so many jobs around at the moment that you may as well apply directly
[05:02] marcello3d: I read a good article about those guys
[05:02] Aria: Yeah. And you can take the time to really write a great cover letter and resume that aims at THEM
[05:03] marcello3d: hmmm, what dist should I run on rackspace cloud...
[05:03] Pritchard: josephg:  Well, I'm currently a student.  Even though I've been programming since forever, companies don't understand this.  Trying to build my portfolio as we speak...
[05:03] Pritchard: Also:  I'm in Ohio.
[05:03] changbeer: sites like github jobs, stackoverflow jobs, are worth watching, dont tie yourself to a language or framework (even node.js etc..) if something interesting/challenging comes up then you'll adapt 
[05:04] marcello3d: they have {arch, centos, debian, fedora, gentoo, oracle, redhat, ubuntu}
[05:04] defunctzombie: marcello3d: debian :)
[05:04] defunctzombie: unstable!
[05:04] marcello3d: I've used gentoo, centos, and currently using debian
[05:05] josephg: marcello3d: unless there's a good reason, I usually go for ubuntu
[05:05] marcello3d: ubuntu is just debian with extra shit, right?
[05:05] nicholasf: Pritchard: to be fair, a lot of programmers use that argument but generally have a lot to learn in their first few roles
[05:05] josephg: yep, and more frequently updated packages.
[05:05] defunctzombie: ubuntu is just debian without any updated packages
[05:05] Pritchard: nicholasf:  Hah.  I'm sure I do.  Specific things that industry programmers do.
[05:05] marcello3d: defunctzombie: debian 6 ok?
[05:05] defunctzombie: other way around, debian unstable will get you the latest :)
[05:05] defunctzombie: you can install 6 which is the latest stable
[05:05] marcello3d: ok
[05:06] defunctzombie: and then upgrade to unstable if you want
[05:06] Pritchard: Maybe it's that I feel like a good investment more than anything else :-/
[05:06] defunctzombie: that is what I usually do
[05:06] marcello3d: do I want? I don't think I want.
[05:06] josephg: defunctzombie: really? huh - must have changed since I used debian
[05:06] marcello3d: not for production server?
[05:06] changbeer: nicholas, correct, when i got first real job id rate my programming skills at 8/10, now after 10 years experience i'd settle at 6
[05:06] nicholasf: Pritchard: I have 12 years of commercial experience. Ive met some coders out of uni who just got it, and some who didnt
[05:06] defunctzombie: you should be fine with 6
[05:06] josephg: I found the unstable releases â€¦ unstable, and the stable releases way too out of date
[05:06] marcello3d: josephg: how is the security on ubuntu though?
[05:06] defunctzombie: it is fine
[05:06] defunctzombie: I have run servers in both
[05:06] defunctzombie: it is the same system
[05:07] Pritchard: nicholasf:  As a comparison, my classes bore me after the first week.  I tested out of three programming classes last term by finishing their final projects over the weekend.
[05:07] defunctzombie: ubuntu is a good choice too imho
[05:07] Lorentz: How does one define if a system is secure anyway
[05:07] nicholasf: Pritchard: yes, but that's not a measurement of being a good commercial programmer
[05:07] defunctzombie: I just went with debian cause I don't care about the upgrade every 6 months
[05:07] Lorentz: How long since last breach?
[05:07] nicholasf: Pritchard: that'sjust being clever
[05:07] Pritchard: nicholasf:  Heh.  I guess I'll take your word for it.
[05:07] marcello3d: Lorentz: that and attitude
[05:07] changbeer: Lorentz, how do you know you've been breached?
[05:07] nicholasf: Pritchard: but it's a damn good start :)
[05:07] defunctzombie: so with debian unstable I just choose when I want to upgrade
[05:07] defunctzombie: and do it then
[05:08] defunctzombie: one cool thing you can do with debian
[05:08] defunctzombie: is install the 6 version
[05:08] defunctzombie: then add the unstable repo
[05:08] marcello3d: I'll go with debian. I'm using it on my other server, and I'm familiar with it enough
[05:08] Pritchard: Thanks :)  I guess I'll continue building my portfolio.  I'm back in school this week, but if I can get this site up and running before the weekend I can start adding projects to it.
[05:08] defunctzombie: and only install the updated packages of what you need
[05:08] marcello3d: sounds like it's still a reasonable choice
[05:08] nicholasf: Pritchard: I think the best way to skill up for commercial work is to just jump into an open source project and become a contributor
[05:08] defunctzombie: it will not install all the unstable packages
[05:08] defunctzombie: only the ones you request
[05:08] marcello3d: nicholasf++
[05:08] catb0t: nicholasf now has 1 beer
[05:08] defunctzombie: and you can pin them with apt pinning
[05:08] defunctzombie: I do this and I like it
[05:08] russfrank: yeah, then you also build a reputation for yourself on the internets.
[05:08] marcello3d: man
[05:09] defunctzombie: best of both world imho
[05:09] Pritchard: nicholasf:  And by that, you mean OSS that people are using commercially?
[05:09] marcello3d: I really hate sysadmin
[05:09] russfrank: sure
[05:09] defunctzombie: hahaha
[05:09] nicholasf: Pritchard: no, just a project that interests you for some reason

[05:11] josephg: .- I'd say its the network effect, but I don't know why it would be that important on a code hosting site
[05:11] changbeer: josephg bitbucket have only recently added git iirc
[05:12] josephg: changbeer: hg is the same as git
[05:12] Lorentz: changbeer: Usually it's decent enough if you follow the software that's exposed and any known bugs/0-day exploits around and patch accordingly, if it's a publically used software like databases and web servers
[05:12] changbeer: err.. no it aint
[05:12] marcello3d: josephg: I read an interesting article about how bitbucket shamelessly copied github's ui/design layout

[05:17] pksunkara: Need to up my game by contributing to node.js core
[05:17] marcello3d: pksunkara: it sounds like you're already contributing to node, what are you trying to get out of it?
[05:18] marcello3d: I think this is a situation of "if you have to ask, ..."
[05:18] smathy has joined the channel
[05:18] defunctzombie: why node.js core? I am with marcello3d on this one.. seems like there is no clear reason
[05:18] defunctzombie: I mean.. why stop at node.js core? why not the v8 engine ;)
[05:18] SubStack: pksunkara: you should solve your own problems
[05:18] defunctzombie: or the kernel
[05:18] pksunkara: I am a students, I don't encounter many problems
[05:18] SubStack: "contributing" for the sake of it doesn't help anybody
[05:19] pksunkara: that is why I am asking on the irc for problems
[05:19] SubStack: because the quality of the contributions don't have any soul
[05:19] pquerna: https://github.com/joyent/node/pulls
[05:19] marcello3d: pksunkara: make a web site
[05:19] pquerna: review pull requests
[05:19] josephg: SubStack: +1
[05:19] marcello3d: make your own problems
[05:19] SubStack: scratch some itches
[05:19] defunctzombie: fix some bugs
[05:19] josephg: pkrumins: when I was at school, I wrote games
[05:19] josephg: that was way fun, expecially if you have some friends to help out
[05:19] defunctzombie: look at a todo list for a project and do it
[05:19] Aria: Write tools to program better.
[05:19] defunctzombie: that is how I started with ubuntu contributing back in the day
[05:20] defunctzombie: it is easy
[05:20] Aria: Then write tools to fix those tools ;-)
[05:20] pksunkara: defunctzombie: Thanks, that is what I am searching for
[05:20] ceej has joined the channel
[05:21] pksunkara: but joyent/node doesn't seem to have a TODO list
[05:21] changbeer: bugs = todo
[05:21] Pritchard: Yeah, I'd rather contribute out of interest.
[05:21] Aria: node is also pretty low-level. Most of what people are doing with node are outside of node proper.
[05:21] rchavik has joined the channel
[05:21] Pritchard: but digging around TODOs might peak my interest :)
[05:22] Pritchard: Since I'm entirely new to the scene, I'll have to see how github, community contributions, and the tools themselves all work before diving in fully.
[05:22] defunctzombie: there are different types of contributions
[05:23] defunctzombie: scratching an itch is a common one and many people just ever do that
[05:23] josephg: yeah
[05:23] defunctzombie: if you just want to see what there is to do
[05:23] defunctzombie: the issues on github
[05:23] defunctzombie: is a good place
[05:23] defunctzombie: I would check out older issues
[05:23] defunctzombie: and see why they have not been fixed
[05:23] defunctzombie: or maybe ping them to see if the people still have the issue
[05:23] defunctzombie: closing outstanding issues is a very valiant effort
[05:24] defunctzombie: that will win you many thanks
[05:24] pksunkara: Is this fixed? https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/965
[05:24] marcello3d: anyone here use chef/knife?
[05:24] defunctzombie: if it says open then it is not fixed
[05:24] defunctzombie: so submit a patch for it and start from there :)
[05:24] pksunkara: :)
[05:25] defunctzombie: marcello3d, puppet :/
[05:25] marcello3d: puppet's website is really confusing. all I could find was the enterprise bullshit
[05:25] defunctzombie: hahahaha
[05:26] marcello3d: I found this article, but it started talking about <?php?> and was freaking the crap out of me http://evolvingweb.ca/story/controlling-your-cloud-puppet
[05:26] konobi: cherf/knife seem pretty reasonable
[05:26] konobi: though i've only used chef-solo
[05:26] defunctzombie: http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/techniques.html
[05:26] josephg: pksunkara, Pritchard: I would seriously recommend just trying to make something cool. yesterday a friend came over and we started making this for fun
[05:26] josephg: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2494815/space/space.html
[05:26] josephg: (click to shoot)
[05:26] defunctzombie: that is decent cause it has examples
[05:26] stonebranch has joined the channel
[05:26] josephg: we might expand it out, or we migth abandon it - but either way its fun to make stuff.
[05:27] defunctzombie: http://docs.puppetlabs.com/#installing-and-configuring
[05:27] defunctzombie: I do find their website has gotten more complex
[05:27] Pritchard: josephg:  Right now I'm working on my personal website, solved an NP-hard problem in JavaScript today, too.
[05:27] defunctzombie: I guess cause I know what to call the various things i know exactly where to go
[05:27] josephg: Pritchard: cool.
[05:27] defunctzombie: but for a new user it would be a nightmare
[05:28] defunctzombie: I hope that was a joke
[05:28] Pritchard: josephg:  The page you linked me to doesn't do anything.  The source is just script tags?
[05:28] marcello3d: seems reasonable... http://bitfieldconsulting.com/puppet-vs-chef
[05:28] pksunkara: josephg: I wrote online collaborative code editor using socket.io for hackathon
[05:28] josephg: Pritchard: you'll need chrome
[05:28] josephg: pksunkara: haha cool - you should help me write sharejs
[05:28] Pritchard: That's the only browser I use for real >_>
[05:28] pksunkara: I can
[05:28] pksunkara: can you post a link ?
[05:29] Pritchard: defunctzombie:  You hope what was a joke?
[05:29] marcello3d: chef is ruby, screw that ;D
[05:29] josephg: pksunkara: http://sharejs.org/
[05:29] defunctzombie: marcello3d last I heard google uses puppet for their desktop deployments
[05:29] defunctzombie: dunno if it is still true
[05:29] josephg: pksunkara: code: https://github.com/josephg/ShareJS
[05:29] defunctzombie: puppet is ruby too
[05:29] defunctzombie: btw :)
[05:29] marcello3d: fffffffff
[05:30] pksunkara: damn, when did you write that?
[05:30] defunctzombie: I would use puppet
[05:30] marcello3d: yea that's fine
[05:30] defunctzombie: chef is a case of .. we didn't want to learn puppet so we made our own
[05:30] marcello3d: I just needed to find docs
[05:30] marcello3d: guides whatever
[05:30] marcello3d: so much text
[05:30] Pritchard: josephg:  Yeah, I'm sorry.  I'm on chrome and all that's in the .html file is <canvas></canvas> then three script tags.  Nothing is displaying on the web page.
[05:30] josephg: Pritchard: hm - do the script tags load?
[05:30] josephg: like, are they 404ing or anything?
[05:31] defunctzombie: heh
[05:31] defunctzombie: documentors be documenting
[05:31] Pritchard: josephg:  The javascript console gives me "cannot call method 'viewport' of null' at atom.js:134
[05:31] Pritchard: Oh!  Yeah, I don't have a graphics card that supports shading.
[05:31] josephg: oh, that'd do it.
[05:31] Pritchard: Now it makes sense.
[05:32] Pritchard: Mind giving me a screenshot of what it looks like?  I'm interested.
[05:32] josephg: pksunkara: I wrote it months ago - still working on it.
[05:32] marcello3d: defunctzombie: so would I install puppet on my laptop to manage a cloud server?
[05:32] josephg: I'm cleaning up the client at the moment, and then I'm going to add cursors
[05:33] pksunkara: You should check the serialization algorigthm in http://github.com/pkumar/codecollab
[05:33] josephg: Pritchard: it looks a bit like this:
[05:33] josephg: http://glimr.rubyforge.org/cake/missile_fleet.html
[05:33] marcello3d: basically I just want an easy way to non-interactively setup a cloud server, install mongo, npm, and node---then I'll figure out the rest
[05:33] pksunkara: It's not complete in the UI
[05:34] Pritchard: Oh neat :)
[05:34] konobi: marcello3d: i'd give chef a try
[05:35] defunctzombie: marcello3d: no, you would install puppet on one of your servers
[05:35] defunctzombie: that server will be the puppet master
[05:35] sdwrage has joined the channel
[05:35] defunctzombie: and the other puppets will talk to it
[05:35] marcello3d: oh. but I just want one server (for now)
[05:35] defunctzombie: that is fine
[05:35] defunctzombie: the puppet master can also have a puppet client on the same box :)
[05:36] defunctzombie: and manage itself
[05:36] defunctzombie: it is very meta
[05:36] marcello3d: o_O
[05:36] josephg: pksunkara: you should learn coffeescript :D
[05:36] defunctzombie: no you should not
[05:36] pksunkara: joshephg: Why ?
[05:36] marcello3d: it's raining
[05:36] josephg: because its awesome
[05:36] marcello3d: ok, puppet docs are overwhelming me :D
[05:37] pksunkara: I know coffee
[05:37] pksunkara: I wrote that before my coffee days
[05:37] pksunkara: :D
[05:37] defunctzombie: learning coffescript is like learning c preprocessor for all your work, it may seem nice at first, but really you should have just learned the real language to start
[05:37] defunctzombie: ;)
[05:37] josephg: defunctzombie: it looks like he knows JS already
[05:37] defunctzombie: marcello3d: you just gotta battle through it
[05:38] josephg: also, codecollab looks cool - though I suspect with lag its possible for the text to go out of sync
[05:38] josephg: though if you're working locally it'd be fine
[05:38] pksunkara: don't know, it still has bugs, had no time to work on it
[05:38] kazupon has joined the channel
[05:38] josephg: yep, for sure
[05:38] josephg: sharejs is basically that, but with more code and things
[05:39] defunctzombie: if you haven't given up on it I can show you next time there is a meetup :)
[05:39] pksunkara: but the algorithm to serialize the events is good
[05:39] josephg: pksunkara: what did you base it on?
[05:39] pksunkara: algorithm ?
[05:39] josephg: yeah
[05:40] defunctzombie: for one server tho, you will probly be better off just hand installing anyway
[05:40] pksunkara: each event generates a version and we store the version in memory
[05:40] konobi: generally i'll not use a library written in coffee... lots of folks are the same
[05:40] marcello3d: defunctzombie: I think I get the general idea, just seems more complicated than it needs to be for my situation---maybe I should just start with some ssh scripts :)
[05:40] defunctzombie: yea
[05:40] defunctzombie: that sounds easier :)
[05:40] pksunkara: and every event will be broadcasted back
[05:41] josephg: konobi: really? Why?
[05:41] defunctzombie: josephg, cause it adds more dependencies
[05:41] defunctzombie: and things to debug when stuff breaks
[05:41] marcello3d: less is more.
[05:41] konobi: i don't want to be debuging coffee shit when stuff breaks
[05:41] defunctzombie: an if you don't know coffeescript then it is useless cause you can't debug it
[05:41] josephg: less code is more too though
[05:42] defunctzombie: it isn't that much less code tho
[05:42] konobi: it's all about stack traces and call sites
[05:42] pksunkara: konobi: a lib written in coffee can generate js before publishing to npm
[05:42] marcello3d: yea, that's the main problem with coffeescript, it's only very incrementally better 
[05:42] defunctzombie: that is the thing, it is really just a bit of syntax sugar, not crazy shifting in how you write anything
[05:42] pksunkara: so, no extra dependencies while using it
[05:42] konobi: pksunkara: so?
[05:42] defunctzombie: I argue that it is worse
[05:42] josephg: ACTION blinks
[05:42] marcello3d: have you ever tried to read generated coffeescript?
[05:42] defunctzombie: cause you still have to understand how js works
[05:42] marcello3d: it's terrible :)
[05:43] pksunkara: why do you wanna read generated coffeescript?
[05:43] konobi: pksunkara: so the module author will accept my changesets to their generated JS code?
[05:43] rchavik has joined the channel
[05:43] marcello3d: trying to figure out how a module works?
[05:43] pksunkara: If you want to understand the module, read coffeescript
[05:43] Pritchard: IDK.  I'd rather stick with javascript.  I'm a fan of curly braces :(
[05:43] defunctzombie: I am too :)
[05:43] pksunkara: if you want to use it, use generated js
[05:43] josephg: bah
[05:43] marcello3d: that assumes you know coffeescript
[05:43] josephg: â€¦. cretins!
[05:43] Pritchard: That's my solution.
[05:44] josephg: I guess i've come from a ruby background
[05:44] marcello3d: and that the cs compiler is perfect
[05:44] Pritchard: Generated CoffeeScript -> Generated JavaScript -> I will read it.
[05:44] josephg: but yeah, coffeescript isn't hard to read
[05:44] Pritchard: ACTION is just kidding
[05:44] defunctzombie: coffeescript is just for ruby people that don't want to read c style code ;P
[05:44] pksunkara: :D
[05:44] josephg: if you know javascript + ruby, its about an hour of learning to know the language
[05:44] Aria: s/ruby/python/
[05:44] marcello3d: ruby is a bizarre looking language. they should fix that shit up, add some curly braces and parentheses
[05:45] pksunkara: I didn't even try to learn ruby
[05:45] Aria: ... Ruby is full of those.
[05:45] josephg: ACTION winces
[05:45] marcello3d: never could have been stuffed to learn ruby. never saw a point
[05:45] pksunkara: I directly started using rails for the first time this summer
[05:45] lyte_ has joined the channel
[05:45] Lorentz: Should be more like perl
[05:45] Aria: Heh. Oy.
[05:45] Aria: Ruby's great. Rails ruined it.
[05:45] Aria: So much sparkly fairy dust everywhere.
[05:45] defunctzombie: someday people will realize development is more than knowing the language
[05:45] marcello3d: lots of languages are great
[05:45] konobi: i suppose you also monkey patch built in object/function prototype
[05:45] Aria: You sneeze and the magic blows away.
[05:45] defunctzombie: it is knowing the idioms of the platform
[05:45] pksunkara: In OOP, ruby is definitely the best
[05:46] marcello3d: java is the best
[05:46] marcello3d: and with that, I go back to coding.
[05:46] Aria: ooc-lang is best lang!
[05:46] konobi: OCaml is the best
[05:46] josephg: nah
[05:46] josephg: I do everything in ASM
[05:46] defunctzombie: don't feed the trolls
[05:46] SubStack: Aria: agree @ rails
[05:46] konobi: =0P
[05:46] josephg: everything else is just a bit of syntax sugar
[05:46] SubStack: ruby is neat, except the module system is annoying
[05:46] pksunkara: I write in binary
[05:46] pksunkara: :D
[05:46] Aria: Yeah. I wish Ruby had node-style modules, using closures.
[05:46] SubStack: rails ruined ruby a lot but rubygems also ruined ruby a little bit
[05:47] k1ttty has joined the channel
[05:47] josephg: pksunkara: pah! binary isn't even strongly typed!
[05:47] SubStack: yes!
[05:47] Aria: Yeah. Rubygems is right in there.
[05:47] SubStack: I hate having to look into the rdocs of a project to just see what it exports
[05:47] SubStack: in node I can just require('modulename') on the repl and it's super obvious
[05:47] marcello3d: defunctzombie: do you have any insight here? https://github.com/marcello3d/node-mongolian/issues/61
[05:47] Aria: Yeah.
[05:47] Lorentz: As if actually code, just grab a bunch of resistors, caps and transistors and get at soldering
[05:47] Aria: Aright. Off to bed with me. Something about killing 450 assertions makes me a sleepy girl.
[05:48] SubStack: more hacking for me tonight
[05:48] josephg: do people seriously avoid libraries written in coffeescript?
[05:48] josephg: that makes me sad
[05:48] marcello3d: josephg: I do
[05:48] Aria: josephg: I avoid them unless they seem perfect already.
[05:48] pksunkara: uber sad :(
[05:48] SubStack: I've been bouncing between projects all night.
[05:48] nicholasf: josephg: well, the only reason Im here is because of coffeescript
[05:48] SubStack: I should probably finish at least one of them.
[05:49] marcello3d: josephg: especially if all the examples are in coffeescript.
[05:49] defunctzombie: josephg: I do as well
[05:49] Aria: josephg: I really don't want to have to deal with the syntax to contribute or understand the code. So unless it's already really good, I get the old NIH symptoms.
[05:49] defunctzombie: marcello3d: they seem to have responded
[05:49] defunctzombie: and the lowercase thing was the problem
[05:49] Aria: Aright. Night!
[05:50] marcello3d: defunctzombie: yea, but the docs are inconsistent, and I never had a problem with the current spelling on 1.8...
[05:50] marcello3d: it's a bit worrisome that some random implementation is failing because of the case...
[05:50] defunctzombie: wow, well, if the docs are inconsistent that would be a mongo issue
[05:50] defunctzombie: yea.. welcome to mongo :)
[05:51] josephg: Hm. Well, I'm sad people might avoid my libraries because I write them in coffeescript
[05:51] defunctzombie: maybe it is gridfs specific?
[05:51] josephg: but I'm not sad enough to use javascript, because after using coffeecript, javascript seems unnecessarily awful
[05:51] marcello3d: defunctzombie: naw, gridfs is app-level
[05:51] MatthewS has joined the channel
[05:51] pksunkara: joseph: link your best coffee lib here
[05:51] pksunkara: josephg: link your best coffee lib here
[05:52] defunctzombie: ah
[05:52] defunctzombie: I did not know that
[05:52] defunctzombie: never used gridfs
[05:52] marcello3d: yea, it's just two collections, an index/metadata
[05:52] marcello3d: and then a collection of blocks
[05:52] josephg: pksunkara: 'best' is hard
[05:52] defunctzombie: wait..so what was the problem here... their install wants all lower case?
[05:52] marcello3d: yes
[05:53] defunctzombie: does all lower case work with other versions?
[05:53] josephg: pksunkara: http://josephg.github.com/node-browserchannel/docs/server.html
[05:53] marcello3d: let's see...
[05:53] defunctzombie: maybe 1.8 onward changed to lowercase?
[05:53] defunctzombie: or 1.8.x
[05:53] defunctzombie: cause they did not specify the point release
[05:53] jldbasa has joined the channel
[05:53] marcello3d: well I'm running 2.0
[05:53] marcello3d: and it works with getLastError
[05:54] marcello3d: seems to work with getlasterror, too
[05:54] marcello3d: let me look at the java driver
[05:54] marcello3d: they do lowercase
[05:54] defunctzombie: josephg: so the issue is that by writing it in coffeescript you did not save much space
[05:55] pksunkara: josephg: What you should do is, compile coffee to js before publishing and change coffee in readme to js
[05:55] defunctzombie: and just made it much harder for people to read who don't know cs
[05:55] defunctzombie: marcello3d: guess they required all lowercase before
[05:55] marcello3d: yea, that must be it
[05:55] marcello3d: I'll just switch it
[05:56] defunctzombie: josephg: I mean you basically just save the function keyword and the { } .. is it really worth it?
[05:56] defunctzombie: marcello3d: sounds right to me
[05:57] hij1nx has joined the channel
[05:57] josephg: pksunkara, defunctzombie: I don't program in coffeescript just to make the code terser
[05:57] josephg: though that certainly helps
[05:57] wolftankk has joined the channel
[05:57] marcello3d: defunctzombie: now I'm wondering which other methods might be other cases...
[05:57] marcello3d: like isMaster...
[05:57] pksunkara: then, what is your motivation to program in coffee ?
[05:57] defunctzombie: I would post a jira with 10gen
[05:57] boltR has joined the channel
[05:57] defunctzombie: and ask for clarification on the docs
[05:57] josephg: code like this: https://github.com/josephg/ShareJS/blob/master/src/server/model.coffee#L240-289 would be much longer in JS
[05:57] josephg: - and harder to read imo
[05:57] pksunkara: I do it because, it's easy to read, document and less code to write
[05:57] marcello3d: defunctzombie: lazy :D
[05:58] marcello3d: github really needs code search on the repo you're looking at
[05:58] pksunkara: it has but only in private repos
[05:58] josephg: pksunkara: would it make much difference publishing compiled JS?
[05:58] defunctzombie: josephg: that code is nested too much anyway and could probly be reformated to make less painful in normal js
[05:59] marcello3d: josephg: that code is pretty hard to read already
[05:59] josephg: defunctzombie: I disagree, actually.
[05:59] josephg: the code is pretty compilcated, already
[05:59] marcello3d: yea
[05:59] pksunkara: josephg: yes, the user using your module doesn't need coffeescript and time will be reduced to load the module
[05:59] defunctzombie: the reason it is "painful" is because it nests like 6 levels or more
[05:59] marcello3d: so clean up your code
[05:59] josephg: making it take more space wouldn't reduce its complexity
[05:59] ioNull has joined the channel
[05:59] marcello3d: it's already too complicated
[05:59] josephg: its all essential complexity
[05:59] josephg: I can spread it around
[05:59] josephg: but then it would just take up more space
[05:59] defunctzombie: space is free
[06:00] marcello3d: no it's not
[06:00] pksunkara: marcello3d: the code intended is complicated
[06:00] marcello3d: bytes are expensive
[06:00] defunctzombie: breaking into smaller functions makes it clearer what is going on
[06:00] josephg: scrolling is expensive.
[06:00] defunctzombie: and what each thing is supposed to do
[06:00] defunctzombie: and you can test each component if you need to
[06:00] marcello3d: does coffeescript have good IDE support yet?
[06:00] josephg: marcello3d: no
[06:00] r04r has joined the channel
[06:00] josephg: defunctzombie: â€¦ maybe, in this case.
[06:01] defunctzombie: also, everthing in your else statements
[06:01] josephg: but I'm not convinced thats true in general.
[06:01] defunctzombie: could be unindented
[06:01] defunctzombie: if your first if just returned
[06:01] marcello3d: well... you asked why we would be less likely to use a CS module
[06:01] defunctzombie: that will save you an indentation level (which I think is your "complexity" here
[06:01] josephg: defunctzombie: thats a good point.
[06:01] secoif has joined the channel
[06:01] marcello3d: are you satisfied with the reasoning?
[06:01] localhost has joined the channel
[06:01] Marko has joined the channel
[06:02] defunctzombie: also... I hate things like return blah blah unless
[06:02] defunctzombie: seems nice at first but just makes me read the line twice
[06:02] defunctzombie: since I first think it returns
[06:02] russfrank: it kinda confuses the control flow.
[06:02] josephg: defunctzombie: heh - I hate having a if (error) { callback(error); return; } everywhere
[06:02] defunctzombie: then only realize it returns on a specific case
[06:02] russfrank: things like that only make code less clear..
[06:02] zomg: defunctzombie: I recall there was some study which actually proved that in Perl it was unclear
[06:02] marcello3d: josephg: yea, that's why I made the safetynet function in mongolian
[06:03] zomg: Guess people will never learn
[06:03] zomg: =)
[06:03] brokenjames has joined the channel
[06:03] defunctzombie: josephg: make a control flow handler ;)
[06:03] josephg: if a line starts with 'return', and there is code underneath it, its obvious that the return is conditional
[06:03] marcello3d: coffeescript with fibers
[06:03] defunctzombie: zomg: haha
[06:03] pksunkara: josephg: compiling into js before publishing is good cuz the user using your module doesn't need coffeescript as dependency and the time needed to load the module will be reduced
[06:03] defunctzombie: josephg: or an error
[06:03] defunctzombie: "obvious" is relative
[06:04] marcello3d: josephg: wasn't obvious to me until defunctzombie explained it...but I wasn't looking that closely
[06:04] defunctzombie: I can just as easily assume that to be unreachable code and question it
[06:04] josephg: defunctzombie: â€¦ um, I suppose - that pattern is extremely common in all the javascript I write
[06:04] dilvie has joined the channel
[06:04] josephg:  / coffeescript
[06:04] josephg: maybe I should try a safety net function like marcello3d suggests though
[06:05] josephg: - thats quite clever.
[06:05] russfrank: hence why i don't use coffeescript :]
[06:05] marcello3d: I don't know if it's a good idea, it's just what I ended up with....
[06:05] defunctzombie: also, the last line with add docName, error, data, etc
[06:05] josephg: I think there are two issues here - one is that I have long, twisty functions, and the other is coffeescript
[06:05] marcello3d: https://github.com/marcello3d/node-mongolian/blob/master/lib/util.js
[06:05] defunctzombie: is very strange to me
[06:05] defunctzombie: looks too much like a variable definition
[06:05] defunctzombie: is it a function call?
[06:05] defunctzombie: or a return statement?
[06:06] Advant: Anyone know what good/acceptable hit ratio with memcached is?
[06:06] r04r has joined the channel
[06:06] josephg: defunctzombie: its a function call.
[06:06] josephg: - its obviously not a variable definition
[06:06] defunctzombie: but isn't the last line of any function in cs also the return?
[06:06] josephg: yes, but that code is in a callback
[06:06] russfrank: yeah coffee is one of those we don't need parens for anything! languages
[06:06] josephg: so returning there is kinda meaningless (unless getOpsInternal does something special with the callback's return value, which you never do)
[06:07] defunctzombie: right.. so I am saying it is not clear from the source what is intended
[06:07] marcello3d: russfrank: probably abused by lisp as a child
[06:07] defunctzombie: hahaha
[06:07] russfrank: ACTION laughs
[06:07] slifty_corsair has joined the channel
[06:07] josephg: I think its pretty clear that its not a variable definition
[06:07] marcello3d: child abuse is nothing to laugh about
[06:07] defunctzombie: the syntax should not have uncertainty imho
[06:07] russfrank: josephg: you write lots of coffee :]
[06:07] russfrank: of course you think it's clear
[06:07] russfrank: i don't at all, though!
[06:08] josephg: russfrank: yes. and I expect anyone reading my code to know coffeescript
[06:08] josephg: which is perhaps arrogant of me, but thats my perogative
[06:08] marcello3d: that's fine, you're more than welcome to expect that
[06:08] confoocious has joined the channel
[06:08] confoocious has joined the channel
[06:08] marcello3d: but that's also why non-coffeescript developers are less likely to use the module
[06:08] josephg: yep.
[06:09] russfrank: its hard for me to verify your program for correctness if it uses some pretty weird looking syntax..
[06:09] Draco_ has joined the channel
[06:09] josephg: hah - I have more tests than code
[06:09] maxogden: i wrote a big js patch for josephg's project a while back and received back a bunch of coffeescript propaganda :P
[06:09] marcello3d: russfrank: now that's just being languagist ;D
[06:09] defunctzombie: hahaha
[06:09] josephg: maxogden: :D - though I accepted the patch without changing it to coffeescript
[06:09] lazyshot has joined the channel
[06:10] marcello3d: does CS let you inline JS?
[06:10] josephg: yep
[06:10] josephg: you can put it in backticks ``
[06:10] r04r has joined the channel
[06:10] r04r has joined the channel
[06:10] josephg: anyway, I'll consider building it and publishing a compiled module (to remove the coffeescript dependancy)
[06:11] josephg: and I think defunctzombie's point about a lot of the complexity coming from indentation is spot on
[06:11] josephg: - I think unindenting my else blocks is a good idea
[06:11] josephg: (well, refactoring it so there's a return at the end of the if)
[06:11] josephg: my examples are all already in javascript
[06:11] marcello3d: josephg: I think if you want to attract JS developers to use a CS module you'll need to appeal to them in the docs "you can use this with JS, too. here's an example/how to use:"
[06:12] josephg: marcello3d: Scroll down:
[06:12] josephg: https://github.com/josephg/ShareJS/blob/master/README.md
[06:12] josephg: all the examples are already in JS
[06:13] marcello3d: josephg: I saw that, actually, wasn't sure if that module was cs
[06:13] josephg: marcello3d: to me, its not important. coffeescript is learnable in about 2 hours
[06:13] marcello3d: you're not going to learn it unless you want to, though
[06:14] Pritchard: Ho'kay.  Now officially stalking a friend on github :)
[06:14] Pritchard: It feels good to have friends in AUTHOR files...
[06:14] josephg: Yes. I'll scare off potential developers who don't want to learn it
[06:14] marcello3d: being aware of the syntax, and crafting elegant code in a language are very different
[06:14] marcello3d: I would say you haven't learned a language until you fall in the latter end of the spectrum
[06:15] Pritchard: ACTION loves OSS for that bragging right, among many other reasons.
[06:15] marcello3d: I might be able to read and possibly even hobble together some coffeescript, but I've hardly learned it
[06:15] josephg: marcello3d: yeah, true - though you're still dangerous in coffeescript long before then
[06:15] r04r has joined the channel
[06:15] josephg: ACTION nods
[06:15] josephg: its true that the way I've written my coffeescript has changed a fair bit since learning the language
[06:16] josephg: in any case, thankyou guys for all the comments (marcello3d, Pritchard, defunctzombie, pksunkara)
[06:16] Pritchard: ACTION forks Node.js
[06:16] josephg: â€¦ and maxogden

[07:59] shanebo: zomg, usually something like this works but it's null: http://jsfiddle.net/mWA8n/
[07:59] runvnc: I guess I just have to wipe the server and start over
[07:59] runvnc: unless I can find something that must be fooling it into thinking that node is installed. its like its not completely uninstalled I think
[07:59] zomg: runvnc: try make clean or make purge or whatever it is
[07:59] braoru has joined the channel
[07:59] zomg: and then run configure again from the root of the dir where you cloned the git repo
[07:59] shanebo: zomg, that worked. thanks!
[08:00] zomg: shanebo: on a second thought, you might want .+ instead of .* since otherwise it will match $()
[08:00] runvnc: ok good idea zomg
[08:00] runvnc: Nothing to clean (project not configured)
[08:00] zomg: also it probably will screw up if you have something like $foo(bar())

[08:03] zomg: shanebo: np
[08:03] jesusabdullah: I was looking at programming jobs back in ol' AK, and I guess a lot of places are windows shops

[08:04] jesusabdullah: the clr is comparable to the jvm right?

[08:04] runvnc: I think v8 is more lightweight though
[08:04] zomg: well C#'s "advanced" stuff is mostly the .NET framework I think
[08:04] jesusabdullah: I was gonna see what there was for numerical things
[08:04] zomg: And I guess it gives you certain things in a more familiar style, but you can emulate most of its features in JS as well
[08:05] zomg: So I guess you could in a way consider it as such
[08:05] runvnc: I'm not saying we are really missing those features
[08:05] runvnc: because the dynamic stuff in js trumps most of it
[08:05] runvnc: I mean, not really missing _most_ of them

[08:28] Nuck: Pritchard: Is that XHR2?
[08:29] sorensen: heres a relevant question: at what point do you kill a project

[08:29] Pritchard: I'm making the server request using the standard XMLHttpRequest object.
[08:29] Nuck: Pritchard: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XMLHttpRequest this might help a bit
[08:30] Nuck: Pritchard: The problem appears not to be Node.js, but in your client-side JS :)
[08:30] Pritchard: I use XMLHttpRequest all the time :-/

[08:32] Nuck: Pritchard: Really?
[08:32] Pritchard: ASP.NET, yeah.
[08:32] Pritchard: We're not talking classic ASP.
[08:32] Nuck: Most jobs in web dev seem to be rails or PHP nowadays
[08:33] Pritchard: That's entirely different.
[08:33] Nuck: I know
[08:33] Pritchard: Okay.
[08:33] Nuck: MS is killing off .NET nowadays
[08:33] Nuck: Slowly abandoning it
[08:33] Pritchard: Shame.  That's what they're teaching us in school.
[08:33] Nuck: Pritchard: They still teach Java in many schools
[08:33] `10`: i'm using socket.io for a variety of things, and the one pattern that comes up all the time is request->response.  any suggestions for a library that provides this?  socket.io doesn't seem to have the concept of middleware in any docs
[08:33] Pritchard: They're ASP.NET/SQL Server fans here.
[08:33] bergie has joined the channel
[08:33] Nuck: Doesn't mean it's realistic
[08:33] Nuck: Pritchard: They teach Java and Visual Basic at my college
[08:33] Pritchard: They're placing jobs.  I think one program in particular has a near 100% job placement rate...
[08:33] Nuck: Neither of which is really applicable
[08:34] `10`: right now i'm duplicating and fragmenting functionality across rest and socket.io when it doesn't really make sense
[08:34] Pritchard: IDK.  Last I checked for jobs in my area, there were tons of PHP and jQuery jobs, but tons of ASP.NET/C# jobs as well.
[08:34] Pritchard: Tbh, I think Ohio is behind.
[08:34] Nuck: Pritchard: I don't think any big companies use PHP or ASP.NET anymore
[08:34] Nuck: Pritchard: Most big companies are on Rails these days
[08:34] Nuck: Though
[08:34] Nuck: Facebook still uses PHP
[08:35] Pritchard: A lot of sites still use PHP, just like a lot of sites still use .NET.
[08:35] Pritchard: It's expensive to change infrastructures.
[08:35] igl: never seen a company use rails for a "big" website
[08:35] Nuck: `10`: If you're doing request-response, maybe Socket.io isn't the thing you're looking for?
[08:35] Nuck: igl: Github?
[08:35] Nuck: igl: Twitter?
[08:35] Nuck: IIRC, Twitter originally used Rails

[08:37] Nuck: (Which is actually harder than it sounds)
[08:37] Pritchard: Yeah, they're working hard to place me in VB.NET/C# jobs here.
[08:37] `10`: Nuck: for example, server->client request->response
[08:38] Pritchard: I like .NET, really.  Not a big fan of PHP.  I like JavaScript a lot.
[08:38] twist_ has joined the channel
[08:38] `10`: Nuck: though there are a variety of other possibilities, and cases where i want more complex patterns than request->response
[08:38] Pritchard: So I have ASP.NET webservices, but I don't use any builtin ASP.NET tools on the client-side.  Just JavaScript.
[08:38] Pritchard: SQL Server is nice, too.
[08:38] Pritchard: I custom-built the javascript to talk to ASP.NET webservices.
[08:38] svenlito has joined the channel
[08:39] Pritchard: It's reflective and allows for both synchronous and asynchronous calls.
[08:39] `10`: Nuck: rather than deal with the peculiarities of rest for these (and more standard) scenarios, using an inherently bidirectional transport makes sense
[08:39] Nuck: `10`: Honestly, for request-response, I'd strongly advise you to just use a basic RESTful API?
[08:39] Nuck: `10`: Use bidirectional where it's needed, use REST where it's best :P
[08:40] `10`: Nuck: rest doesn't allow you to do a request->response pattern initiated by the server ;)
[08:40] Nuck: `10`: That's not request-response then ;)
[08:40] Nuck: `10`: That's a bidirectional communication you're looking for
[08:40] Nuck: :P
[08:40] `10`: Nuck: sure it is; the server is making a request, and the client is responding; it's not the identities of the endpoints that make the pattern
[08:41] konobi: socket.io?
[08:41] `3rdEden: socket.io all the things
[08:42] `10`: konobi, `3rdEden: the original question: i'm using socket.io for a variety of things, and the one pattern that comes up all the time is request->response.  any suggestions for a library that provides this?  socket.io doesn't seem to have the concept of middleware in any docs
[08:42] Nuck: `3rdEden: Socket.IO FTW
[08:43] Nuck: `10`: We're young, sometimes you gotta make your own tools :D
[08:43] Nuck: And sometimes you gotta be SubStack and just invent ALL the tools.

[08:43] sorensen: lol
[08:43] sorensen: all of the tools!
[08:43] Nuck: ALL THE TOOLS!

[08:44] SubStack: I fix existing tools sometimes too.
[08:45] Nuck: laiz
[08:45] konobi: `10`: that's what http is for
[08:45] SubStack: Like this: https://github.com/jesusabdullah/node-ecstatic/pull/2
[08:45] `10`: that's fine, but before i patch or extend socket.io, i'd like to know if anyone has code for this hiding somewhere
[08:45] arcatan: "rewrote everything"
[08:45] Nuck: Holy shit 15 commits
[08:45] Nuck: SubStack: What arcatan said
[08:46] konobi: `10`: like http.js?
[08:46] Nuck: `10`: Try wrapping socket.io instead?
[08:46] Nuck: konobi: He wants bidirectional request-response
[08:46] `10`: konobi: yes, and that is basically what is going on now for some things, but socket.io is a bit more general and lightweight.  the example i used where http just doesn't fit correctly is request->response initiated by the server
[08:46] [AD]Turbo has joined the channel
[08:47] SubStack: arcatan: well it was just a stub doing fs.readFileSync when I got to it
[08:47] arcatan: :)
[08:47] `10`: Nuck: or all of the above; it'll depend on what makes sense having had a close look at the code
[08:47] kazupon has joined the channel
[08:47] Nuck: `10`: I strongly advise just working around it and listing socket.io as a dependency
[08:47] konobi: `10`: you can attach socket.io to a http server in the same app and key it off a namespace

[08:48] Nuck: Pritchard: I know all the things.
[08:48] davidbanham has joined the channel
[08:48] Pritchard: Configuring the XMLHttpRequest as synchronous led to the error.
[08:48] `10`: konobi: yep, i'm doing that, but not sure how it solves, e.g. server initiated requests
[08:49] Pritchard: Performing an async request doesn't throw one any more.
[08:49] Nuck: Pritchard: Well good, because sync should rot in hell anyways
[08:49] dannyamey has joined the channel
[08:49] `10`: konobi: socket.io is great but it'd be nice to have a layer on the socket that lets me do other patterns, e.g. expecting a response to an emit()
[08:50] Pritchard: Nuck:  It has its uses.
[08:50] Nuck: Pritchard: NEVAR
[08:50] `10`: yes, i can just wrap socket.io and include an extra _id property or similar to use for matching replies to requests
[08:50] Pritchard: Let's say you wanted to execute JavaScript before the page finishes loading.
[08:50] konobi: `10`: send the client an event telling it to download something?
[08:50] Nuck: `10`: Actually might be easier, if socket.io follows FIFO
[08:50] uchuff has joined the channel
[08:50] DennisRasmussen has joined the channel
[08:51] ecin has joined the channel
[08:51] Nuck: Pritchard: You shouldn't.  You should execute whenever the browser has a chance :V
[08:51] `10`: konobi: yeah, but that usage of socket.io isn't necessary for new applications
[08:51] Nuck: Pritchard: Blocking the page from loading is actually a great way to lose visitors
[08:52] Pritchard: Nuck:  It's not "blocking the page from loading" it's "ensuring the presence of all content".
[08:52] konobi: `10`: eh?
[08:52] Nuck: Pritchard: Content shouldn't be handled in JS
[08:52] [AD]Turbo: holq
[08:52] Pritchard: If this happens within a fairly short period of time (less than a second) it's really not an issue.
[08:52] Nuck: Pritchard: HTML is content, CSS is formatting, JS is interactivity
[08:52] Pritchard: Nuck:  Content is generated from JS all the time.
[08:52] Pritchard: That's what AJAX is, Nuck.
[08:53] Nuck: Pritchard: Not at all.  As I recall, Amazon shaved 100ms off pageloads and cut 30% off their bounce rate
[08:53] Nuck: Pritchard: AJAX shouldn't block pageloads
[08:53] Nuck: That's the entire PURPOSE of AJAX
[08:53] `10`: konobi: what i'm saying is, there's no need to use socket.io as just a backup solution that gives you the ability to notify the client, when you could just use it as a true bidirectional transport as you would a socket in desktop application development
[08:53] konobi: there are multiple books on the subject
[08:53] Pritchard: Nuck:  That's its most common use.  But there are possible exceptions.
[08:54] Nuck: Pritchard: That's the purpose of AJAX.  If you're still blocking page rendering, then you're Doing it Wrong.
[08:54] Pritchard: Anything that serves pages to the user blocks the page load until the serve is completes.
[08:54] konobi: `10`: so from the server, you want the client to "magically" know that it needs to download something from the server?
[08:54] `3rdEden: if you are using request response why don't you just use the events api?
[08:54] Nuck: Pritchard: Yes, but the question is whether you're showing them something pretty or just a blank screen
[08:54] `3rdEden: socket.emit('do this') socket.on('on this response', function () { alert('pew pew') })
[08:54] Nuck: Pritchard: You want to make it look like you're doing something even for those 100 milliseconds
[08:54] chjj: lasers!
[08:54] Nuck: Hence why you don't block page rendering
[08:55] Nuck: You show a blank page if you must
[08:55] Nuck: But by god it's got the menu bar!
[08:55] `10`: konobi: clearly not.  e.g. i needn't tell the client "you should go get this data using an http request" when i could just tell it "here's some data"
[08:55] Nuck: And the logo's there too!
[08:55] amigojapan has joined the channel
[08:55] Pritchard: Heh.

[08:56] Nuck: I'm working to start a company :D
[08:56] Nuck: Pritchard: You should render the entire page except that frame, then use JSON and render on the clientside :P
[08:56] `10`: konobi: that's just an event, yes; as is what you were talking about, so far as i can tell.  clearly, socket.io does this.  what i'm saying is, consider e.g. rpc where the server calls a method in the client and the client is expected to return a value
[08:56] beevits has joined the channel
[08:56] Pritchard: :)
[08:56] Pritchard: I might take that advice.
[08:57] Nuck: I wanted to use REST for my entire startup'
[08:57] Nuck: But... Well, it would've been a pain in the ass
[08:57] konobi: `10`: ah... so RPC
[08:57] konobi: there's rpc stuff that sits atop socket.io, iirc
[08:57] Nuck: So we're just doing a basic site with Handlebars templates, then we'll probably use something like those cool pushState-using client-side Express-ish frameworks
[08:58] Nuck: When we have more time, of course

[12:06] Garo_: I tried to start profiling remotely by listening for SIGUSR2 and executing require("profiler").resume(); in it. It kind of works: the node writes about 18 kilobytes to v8.log, but stops appending the profiling data after that. Is the profiler resume() function somehow local to the calling scope? I need to enable the profiling for the entire application for the rest of the program execution. any ideas?

[12:29] plutoniix has joined the channel
[12:30] Garo_: and they'll all end with this as the last line: heap-sample-end,"Heap","allocated"
[12:30] bnoordhuis: Garo_: with what version of node are you testing it?
[12:30] Garo_: 0.4.11. we haven't yet converted to 0.6
[12:30] Garo_: if I do .resume() again on the running instance, the same happens: about 16kb is appended and the last line is heap-sample-end,"Heap","allocated"

[12:45] Garo_: bnoordhuis: hmm, hard to say. maybe there's something under the hood which I haven't learned. To me it looks just that the default setting for profiler.resume() is to have profiler.HEAP_STATS as the default flag
[12:46] dnjaramba has joined the channel
[12:46] bnoordhuis: Garo_: that's correct
[12:46] bnoordhuis: the thing is that v8 added some code that turns off the profiler after some time

[16:07] tomlion has joined the channel
[16:09] plutoniix has joined the channel
[16:09] ph^ has joined the channel
[16:09] felixge: hoodoos: you could use setInterval() to detect event loop freezes > interval timeout 
[16:10] Glenjamin: surely interval would only run *after* the blocking call finishes
[16:10] Glenjamin: by which point its too late
[16:10] russfrank: Glenjamin: right, so you have a watchdog waiting for a message from the setinterval
[16:10] felixge: hoodoos: basically by looking by how much time has passed between the last interval and if its's > your defined interval, something blocked
[16:10] Glenjamin: ah yes, that would work
[16:10] felixge: Glenjamin: what do you mean by too late?
[16:10] russfrank: setinterval pings over a socket to the watchdog, if it takes > 3 secs you page everybody
[16:11] felixge: Glenjamin: you can certainly only detect this after it happened
[16:11] felixge: not during
[16:11] MooGoo: .. while(1){}
[16:11] catb0t: Timeout Error
[16:11] Glenjamin: russfrank's approach would work
[16:11] vkandy has joined the channel
[16:11] felixge: yes
[16:11] felixge: but it's going to be hard to analyze this
[16:11] russfrank: >3 secs between pings I mean
[16:11] felixge: GC will naturally cause freezes here and there
[16:11] russfrank: or something of that nature
[16:12] hoodoos: yeah, no way to findout what actually freeze :)
[16:12] felixge: and by the time a GC takes 3 sec you've already been deep into shit for a while
[16:12] neurodrone has joined the channel

[16:13] mxp: how can i make default ca certificates fine for nodejs?
[16:13] mxp: oauth provides no way to pass in certificate options
[16:14] Glenjamin: yeah, we have all our processes expose an HTTP server with statistics. Then some stuff collects them all and pushes to graphite
[16:14] felixge: <3 graphite
[16:14] stantona has joined the channel
[16:14] hoodoos: thanks for suggestions guys, to look after code which is being developed by 3 programmers and has a lot of lines of code is quite hard :) i was hoping to automaticly detect slow blocking code and point to in right in production, because it test enviroment it's quite hard to find those.
[16:14] Glenjamin: we just expose raw numbers from the application, and let the monitoring stuff do the maths
[16:15] felixge: Glenjamin: are you doing histograms?
[16:15] Glenjamin: mostly line graphs showing throughput
[16:15] felixge: those are hard if you don't aggregate them in a smart way 
[16:15] Glenjamin: since its a message processing pipeline, not an HTTP server
[16:16] Glenjamin: we mainly track queue size, throughput and lifetime of a message from when we got it to when we finished processing
[16:17] felixge: Glenjamin: lifetime of a message seems like something you'd want a histogram for
[16:17] felixge: to be able to say: 95% of our messages have a lifetime < 1sec
[16:17] felixge: 99.9% < 10sec
[16:17] felixge: etc.
[16:17] Glenjamin: perhaps, but we have to process sequentially
[16:17] felixge: because mean/median really suck if you can't assume a normal distribution
[16:17] felixge: which you can't
[16:17] Glenjamin: so we mostly care about how far behind we are right now
[16:17] felixge: oh
[16:18] Glenjamin: or how far behind we were at a particular peak time
[16:18] felixge: now processing sequentially sucks :)

[18:46] fairwinds: isaacs: have just seen your node-tar implementation. I am looking to combine it with gzip for a tar.gz. Have you already done with node's new gzip in 0.6.x ?
[18:46] isaacs: yes
[18:46] maushu has joined the channel
[18:47] isaacs: fairwinds: here's where npm is doing that in the soon-to-be-released 1.1 version: https://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/tar-js/lib/utils/tar.js#L75-94

[18:48] isaacs: fairwinds: i'd like to make the Extract class detect a gzip file from the first few bytes of the header, but haven't gotten to thatyet.
[18:48] isaacs: so, for now, you have to know what it is
[18:49] fairwinds: right. This will be a big help. Was curious to see the steaming and piping implementation to get both
[18:49] isaacs: fairwinds: i still need to document the fstream lib
[18:49] isaacs: it's very very brand new
[18:49] isaacs: (read: "probably has bugs")
[18:50] isaacs: node-tar is designed to work hand-in-hand with it, so you can add a directory, and have it also add teh children, etc.

[19:30] shanebo: jerrysv, yeah me too, mootools pseudo classes function as a class in other languages would. So in my framework if you use sessions middleware it creates one instance of a sessions handler per app, and then a session instance per request if one doesn't exist

[21:38] innociv_: context, my script runs fine.
[21:38] context: innociv_: as in, type in "gdb --args node script.js"
[21:38] wankdanker: bnoordhuis: yeah, i've tried some. what would help get that moving? do you guys need tests?
[21:38] innociv_: Then after a while it either crashes, or is using 100% cpu and doesn't respond.
[21:38] context: then you will see a gdb> prompt
[21:38] context: THEN you type in the break ....
[21:38] bnoordhuis: wankdanker: yes

[21:41] innociv_: alright
[21:41] bnoordhuis: i kind of expect it's bitly returning different output
[21:41] innociv_: I did that, and node is running. It'll take a while for it to hit an error though. Usually it's a few hours.
[21:41] bnoordhuis: innociv_: i'm in no rush
[21:42] bnoordhuis: it's not as is we're all out of bugs :/

[21:42] innociv_: Not that I'm some amazing programmer that could develope something like it myself.

[21:43] innociv_: It was working perfectly fine, just about, until I put minecraft on my server.
[21:43] innociv_: And minecraft is the most resource hogging thing I've ever seen.
[21:45] innociv_: I've seen other programs that go derp when something else uses up the cpu and ram.

[21:45] bnoordhuis: tanepiper: did you switch the files around? the 0.6.2 output looks okay, doesn't it?
[21:46] bnoordhuis: btw, what's the url that you query?
[21:46] tanepiper: switch files around?  Yes, I said earlier my code is working on 0.6.2 fine since i released a fix testing it (on 0.6.1 anyway).  Someone reported a bug that it wasn't working on 0.4.12 and i was able to confirm it
[21:47] bnoordhuis: tanepiper: url?

[21:56] joshsmith: what's the practice for developing with BDD (with vows, for example)?
[21:56] bnoordhuis: tanepiper: the url module has changed between 0.4 and 0.6 - url_object.path is a 0.6 addition
[21:56] ekryski has joined the channel
[21:56] joshsmith: is it still red, green, refactor?
[21:56] tanepiper: bnoordhuis: ahh!
[21:58] tanepiper: so for compatibility i'm going to be better manually building the request url :/
[21:58] smathy has joined the channel
[21:59] tanepiper: hmm bnoordhuis actually, i don't use url.path though? I use pathname in the object, which in docs is in 0.4.12: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.12/api/url.html
[21:59] p1d has joined the channel
[21:59] tanepiper: (unless you're talking about some underlying thing?)
[22:01] bnoordhuis: tanepiper: your code works accidentally with 0.6 :)
[22:01] fangel has joined the channel
[22:02] bnoordhuis: you're passing the url object as an options object to http.get() which expects a .path property
[22:02] tanepiper: ahh i see it now in the result of the url.parse
[22:02] tanepiper: so, it's a bug in 0.6 then rather than 0.4?

[23:09] wankdanker: bnoordhuis: ok. the one thing i noticed is that it tests binding multiple listeners within the same process. imo it should be done with children.
[23:09] wankdanker: bnoordhuis: i see. 
[23:10] bnoordhuis: wankdanker: if that makes it a better test, i'm all for it
[23:10] wankdanker: bnoordhuis: ok. I'll see what I can do. thanks for your input.
