[00:51] llkazu: implement it!
[00:51] techwraith: llkazu: What sucks about it?
[00:52] llkazu: techwraith, depending on which worker the cluster master decides to throw the request at, it either works or doesn't work
[00:52] llkazu: my theory is that only one of 2 workers has the session info for the connection
[00:52] techwraith: Ah, that does suck
[00:52] llkazu: ya :-/
[00:53] techwraith: Seems like you need to to keep session info in some external db (redis or something)
[00:53] tjholowaychuk: llkazu: I think guillermo is working on the scalability issues for socket.io
[00:53] llkazu: whew.
[00:54] tjholowaychuk: AFAIK it will support drivers for whatever persistance you want
[00:54] tjholowaychuk: not sure what will be supported out of the box

[00:59] chrisdickinson: aw.
[00:59] llkazu: pwn't.
[00:59] chrisdickinson: setTimeout does exist in node, though.
[00:59] chrisdickinson: (or ``process.nextTick``)
[00:59] llkazu: v8: var meh = function() { process.nextTick('meh()'); }; meh()

[01:00] v8bot: llkazu: ReferenceError: require is not defined
[01:00] Gotham: what is nextTick? Why is it called tick?
[01:00] techwraith: process is only available in node, I'm pretty sure v8bot is just v8
[01:00] llkazu: gotham, just like a real processor, the JS VM has a clock that ticks.
[01:00] llkazu: every tick some chunk of byte code is run.
[01:00] tyler-iphone: tick is the next firing of the event loop
[01:01] techwraith: with a few things removed of course :)
[01:01] chrisdickinson: llkazu: I'm pretty sure process.nextTick will wait until the current stack is exhausted.
[01:01] Gotham: Are there any counterpoints to building a SaaS project on node.js?
[01:01] llkazu: chrisdickinson, hmm, it might. I'm not actually sure.
[01:01] tyler-iphone: thats kinda cool though

[01:14] chrisdickinson: I mean, don't get me wrong, I hate writing docs using sphinx. readthedocs.org helps a bit
[01:14] llkazu: its just… sphinx requires that you have a masters degree in sphinxology to use properly.
[01:14] jesusabdullah: I've never tried django, so they may be the exception
[01:14] themarmot: how do i tell where node is looking for modules?
[01:14] prettyrobots: piscisaureus_: So...
[01:14] chrisdickinson: llkazu: agreed
[01:14] jesusabdullah: and I think python's are relatively complete, just poorly organized.
[01:14] jesusabdullah: Hard to find what you're looking for a lot of the time.
[01:15] jesusabdullah: Matplotlib's are terrible
[01:15] jesusabdullah: Scipy/Numpy's are *okay*.
[01:15] prettyrobots: piscisaureus_: My thought is to build a Makefile to build on Windows, then run test in cygwin using something like...
[01:15] llkazu: jesusabdullah, the secret to python's documentation is: the module index.
[01:15] llkazu: that all you need :-p
[01:15] chrisdickinson: until recently, JavaScript's docs have been... well, of an interestingly varied quality
[01:15] jesusabdullah: I always have to look up basic shit
[01:15] prettyrobots: http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov-Intro.html#Gcov-Intro
[01:15] llkazu: chrisdickinson, yaaaa, node's docs make me cry, for example.
[01:15] prettyrobots: http://covtool.sourceforge.net/
[01:15] jesusabdullah: Oh, yeah, I have to give that to python--better than the Javascript status quo!
[01:15] llkazu: "sooo fix it"
[01:16] llkazu: http://jsdocs.org/
[01:16] jesusabdullah: That reminds me, I have to tweet to ddg/yegg about how w3schools pages are the top results for my javascript searches.
[01:16] llkazu: this is a good reference.
[01:16] steveklabnik: jesusabdullah: ouch.
[01:16] chrisdickinson: llkazu++
[01:16] v8bot:  chrisdickinson has given a beer to llkazu. llkazu now has 1 beers.
[01:16] steveklabnik: when i first found out that w3schools wasn't associated with w3c, i was kinda shocked. then i realized how bad they were, and it made sense.
[01:16] NuckingFuts: Speaking of Twitter, who's seen http://yes.thatcan.be/my/next/tweet/ <-- this?
[01:16] llkazu: mmm, beer.
[01:16] piscisaureus_: prettyrobots: did ryah tell you to do code coverage?
[01:16] NuckingFuts: cB
[01:17] chrisdickinson: I usually troll MDC for docs.

[01:22] NuckingFuts: (and it has an EXTREMELY sexy design)
[01:22] prettyrobots: Whatever it takes to generate the report, but the report is the goal, not Cygwin.
[01:22] chrisdickinson: the only thing MDC doesn't do is talk about compatibility (which it shouldn't, really!)
[01:22] NuckingFuts: YAY! I got my NodeJS deviantART Chat Server past the handshake and on to the chatroom joining 8D
[01:23] jesusabdullah: Oh snap, this jsdoc site is in sphinx! >:O
[01:23] chrisdickinson: but I think there's a space for a site that covers browser eccentricities exclusively
[01:23] jesusabdullah: I feel like JS docs should be in node.js
[01:23] jesusabdullah: lol :3
[01:23] NuckingFuts: chrisdickinson: I generally use jQuery for browser JS, so I don't worry much there, and I generally assume both V8 and JaegerMonkey are gonna be highly similar (seeing as they're both pretty much standards-compliant)
[01:24] chrisdickinson: jesusabdullah: http://readthedocs.org/docs/fabric/en/1.0.1/ see? sphinx docs can be pretty!

[01:24] chrisdickinson: NuckingFuts: jQuery (mostly, jQuery-isms and plugins, not the actual library) are an almost constant thorn in my side when in-browser
[01:24] jesusabdullah: Certain hallmarks
[01:24] NuckingFuts: For the browser JS that jQuery doesn't handle, I code & test in V8 & Firefox, then when I'm finishing up, I test it on IE7+

[01:26] blkcat: two beers and substack gets drunk?
[01:26] blkcat: what a lightweight ;)
[01:26] jesusabdullah: Yeah, Browserling runs in node.js and lets you interact with the pages directly. Also, it's free if all you need is a few minutes.
[01:26] pyrotechnick: hes cadbury
[01:26] SubStack: pretty much!
[01:26] SubStack: actually it's more like 3 or 4
[01:26] jesusabdullah: Y'know, one more minute to hack into the mainframe
[01:26] ryah: browsershots?
[01:26] SubStack: 2 doesn't usually phase me
[01:26] pyrotechnick: then you're in his pants
[01:26] blkcat: haha.
[01:26] NuckingFuts: To be fair, browsershots has a HUGE selection of browser/os combos
[01:26] jesusabdullah: ^_~
[01:27] chrisdickinson: but yeah, jQuery glosses over too much, and the plugin libraries usually are written in a particularly barf-worthy way :\
[01:27] SubStack: so yeah I just got screenshots working on our admin panel last night in fact
[01:27] jesusabdullah: Yeah, that's fair NuckingFuts 
[01:27] pyrotechnick: he'll show you his module

[01:28] SubStack: sounds like hard work
[01:28] jesusabdullah: Even though I'm emotionally invested in browserling, if that's what you're looking for I would seriously recommend at least checking it out NuckingFuts 
[01:28] NuckingFuts: And install a bunch of versions of the top few browsers on all those.
[01:28] jesusabdullah: Give it a looksee and all that
[01:29] NuckingFuts: Then script it all so I could send a link to my computer and it'd handle it from there...
[01:29] chrisdickinson: NuckingFuts: bonus points if you set it up so you can point all the browsers at one, node-hosted URL and trigger tests on those clients from your work computer

[01:39] pyrotechnick: techwraith: i dont use any so i cant tell you which is the best but i know step is okay
[01:40] pyrotechnick: can anyone help techwraith out with a sequential flow library
[01:40] jesusabdullah: NuckingFuts: They pivoted. Originally there were a lot of ideas for using virtual machines, but web testing ended up being the focus, at least to start with. Also, the original prototype for StackVM (the precursor to Browserling, probably over a year ago by now) was actually written in Haskell!
[01:40] jesusabdullah: techwraith, pyrotechnick: I believe the common ones are async.js and node-seq
[01:41] NuckingFuts: jesusabdullah: lolrly?
[01:41] jesusabdullah: Indeedy.
[01:41] jesusabdullah: SubStack is a big Haskell fan.
[01:41] jesusabdullah: Actually, I believe parts of browserling are written in Haskell, on the windows side of things

[02:00] llkazu: Jckf, why not just borrow a shell on a friend's machine or something?
[02:01] piscisaureus: prettyrobots: allright
[02:01] llkazu: (or use cloud9ide)
[02:01] Jckf: I have a Linux box, but I want to be able to run the code on this machine
[02:01] Booths: I'd go with the ditch windows as well, I had sooo many problems with code on windows that went away when I finally got a linux box
[02:01] llkazu: Jckf, ah. well, i do know that nodes has some weird issues on windows.
[02:01] llkazu: its "not supported"

[02:28] llkazu: …do you mean if you're bound ONLY to localhost?
[02:28] llkazu: look at your listen()
[02:28] llkazu: observe an IP given as the first argument
[02:28] llkazu: if that IP is 0.0.0.0, then you're bound to ALL IPs available to your machine
[02:28] llkazu: if its 127.0.0.1, then its only localhost
[02:28] zakabird: im using     server.listen(port);
[02:29] llkazu: hmm, maybe host is the second arg
[02:29] llkazu: you're probably bound to 127.0.0.1
[02:29] zakabird: this is working for me on both localhost and no.de
[02:29] zakabird: but there are some things i want to deactivate if not on local host
[02:30] llkazu: i /believe/ no.de puts a load balancer in front of you, and the app itself is only bound to localhost:port.
[02:30] zakabird: i guess im looking for a function that gives me the ip the server is using
[02:30] llkazu: the lb on the machine you run on then proxies from the external interface to your machine on the internal.
[02:30] llkazu: anyway, check the HOST header on the incoming http request.
[02:30] zakabird: hmm interesting
[02:30] indutny: ryah: can I give you an advice on ciphers selection?
[02:30] llkazu: and remote_addr
[02:30] indutny: ryah: in tls.js
[02:30] llkazu: and if there's an x-forwarded-for header
[02:31] llkazu: remote_addr = 127.0.0.1 and host is 127.0.0.1 or localhost, and there's no x-forwarded-for header, then the traffic is probably coming from localhost
[02:31] zakabird: thanks llkazu - i'll need to look into that. it's more complex than I realized. thanks for the info!

[03:14] llkazu: tbranyen, hmm, I'm wondering if perhaps the module I'm using to implement web workers for some reason shoves the subprocess to some different working directory
[03:15] tbranyen: i dunno
[03:15] indutny: ryah: that should work, but IMHO we need to emit drain (I'm building patche version...)

[04:49] tbranyen: so it def can
[04:50] ryah: indutny: if you're interested there is a large refactor that needs to be done
[04:50] bnoguchi: trolzies: depends on your use case
[04:50] ryah: indutny: basically servers need to use SSL_new instead of SSL_CTX_new
[04:50] indutny: ryah: interesting
[04:51] trolzies: bnoguchi: I've used mysql before, and I know it'd work here, but what are some example use cases that make a difference?
[04:51] bnoguchi: trolzies: mysql is fully acid. the other 2 are not. mongodb comes with auto-sharding; the other 2 do not. redis is great for subfeatures of your site but not for the whole site
[04:51] ryah: indutny: so that each server-side connection inherits the ca_store from the SSL_CTX associated with the server object
[04:51] indutny: ryah: wow, got it
[04:52] indutny: ryah: cool :)
[04:52] bnoguchi: trolzies: these observations only touch the surface. but there's a lot more nuance
[04:52] trolzies: bnoguchi: ty, i'll think on that
[04:52] indutny: ryah: actually, it's already using SSL_new, but context is created on every connection, right?
[04:53] bnoguchi: trolzies: you might find this useful - http://kkovacs.eu/cassandra-vs-mongodb-vs-couchdb-vs-redis
[04:53] indutny: ryah: so how can I help you?
[04:53] ryah: indutny: yes
[04:53] ryah: there needs to be a single context per server

[06:24] SubStack: jeffmoss: when you use a for loop the variables you declare are in the same scope
[06:25] SubStack: so when you for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {} or whichever, inside that block `i` is the same `i` for every iteration
[06:25] seivan has joined the channel
[06:25] bnoguchi: jeffmoss: a function defines a new scope
[06:25] SubStack: when you do something like [1,2,3].forEach(function (i) { ... }), `i` is bound at a new function scope so it's in a sense a new `i` every time the callback runs
[06:26] bnoguchi: jeffmoss: so the i in function (i) {...} is bound to that new scope
[06:26] bnoguchi: jeffmoss: Exactly what SubStack said
[06:26] soulofpeace_ has joined the channel
[06:26] jeffmoss: yeah is that just the nature of the language?  it's not "pass by reference" ?
[06:27] bnoguchi: jeffmoss: It's pass by reference for most types
[06:27] SubStack: it's more a consequence of how `for` works
[06:27] yenz: it's a byproduct of JS's scoping system
[06:27] bnoguchi: jeffmoss: Just not for Number
[06:27] bnoguchi: jeffmoss: and others
[06:27] yenz: namely, function-only scope
[06:27] yenz: which is what confuses /everybody/ when they start out w/ JS
[06:27] ollie has joined the channel
[06:27] bnoguchi: jeffmoss: So e.g., Number and Boolean are not passed by reference; Objects are passed by reference

[06:39] tbranyen: chapel: the point would be quickly getting the contents of a gist by id
[06:39] jesusabdullah: tbranyen: disable script execution where?
[06:39] tbranyen: pulling down a repo isn't efficient
[06:39] jesusabdullah: In jsdom?

[06:39] tbranyen: yea

[06:42] chapel: :(
[06:42] tbranyen: started a rewrite
[06:42] tbranyen: well rewrite is harsh, a clean up
[06:42] chapel: I made ngist, for creating gists, was the first cli and module for gists on node
[06:43] mscdex: it's impossible trying to implement a protocol that can have both plain text and binary, without giving you the byte count for binary data ahead of time
[06:43] mscdex: :/
[06:43] chapel: didn't have any code for getting gists
[06:43] tbranyen: oh nice
[06:43] chapel: but it wouldn't be hard since there is an api

[08:21] V1: Anyways, we have started to do some proxy block testing of our own. As we want to run socket.io on port 4000 so it doesn't mess with our current deployment stack
[08:21] V1: and we measure that about 5% of all our traffic is using a proxy that blocks that port
[08:21] mjr_: sad, but you pretty much need to use port 80 or 443 for everything
[08:22] saschagehlich: V1: did some cool configuration with haproxy + nginx + node
[08:22] V1: mjr_: yup, but our whole apache stack runs on 80 already, and we are not in the position of moving that, or adding a proxy to that
[08:22] mjr_: need another IP, unfortunately
[08:23] mjr_: We went through this a while back.  We ended up just getting a bunch of IPs.
[08:23] mjr_: Unfortunately the only way to really handle it.
[08:23] mjr_: And boy, the proxy issues are CRAZY
[08:23] V1: mjr_: yup, we considered that, but that would mean that we would have to run Socket.IO in a cross domain fasion.. which causes some high quality transports to be disabled
[08:23] mjr_: Did you know: many companies are still behind a proxy that does not support chunked encoding?
[08:23] mjr_: Sad, but true.
[08:24] mjr_: If you make a POST through this proxy with chunked specified, you'll get a 501 back.
[08:24] V1: So at this point we consider adding a port check, and if users pass they will connect to port :4000 for real time data streaming, and if they fail, they will connecting to a different subdomain on port 80..

[08:25] V1: which would mean that about 5% of our users will be forced to use less ideal transports, but so be it
[08:25] mjr_: whole serious pile, that is
[08:25] mjr_: As far as I can tell, the only real way around all of these proxy issues is to use HTTPS.
[08:25] V1: saschagehlich: but if you find out what the issue was for the connect_fails in the first place, do share it :p
[08:26] V1: mjr_: yeah, I considered that.. But before we do that I want high quality HTTPS support in node.js =p
[08:27] mjr_: sigh, yeah, me too
[08:27] mjr_: We are using it anyway though
[08:28] V1: mjr_: Yup, but I rather avoid it if i have the option
[08:28] mjr_: for a lot of captive portals and proxies, HTTPS is the only way to go for streaming.
[08:28] saschagehlich: V1: sure, I definitely will
[08:28] mjr_: Plus, then it's HTTPS, which is where everything needs to go anyway.
[08:28] V1: Id rather see everything go SPDY :)
[08:28] mjr_: sure
[08:28] mjr_: I would also like a pony
[08:29] mjr_: Actually, my daughter would.  I would like a Ferrari.

[10:41] augustl: tmedema: promises are nice, if I understand you correctly
[10:41] augustl: in general, I use them when I have to track state of multiple callbacks, or when I have to nest callbacks and I can't abstract away the nesting in a sensible way.
[10:42] tmedema: augustl: if I need to do something simple like, insert something to a database and wait for the callback, would I benefit from such library?
[10:43] augustl: not imo
[10:43] ryankirkman has joined the channel
[10:43] augustl: but if you were to execute two sql queries and do something when both finish, I'd use promises
[10:43] augustl: rather than manually tracking callCount == 2 or whatever
[10:44] tmedema: augustl: ah I get it, I actually do need such logic, will look into promises
[10:44] tmedema: there is also a library called "Step" 
[10:45] augustl: promises is a generic pattern that's in (or suggested at least) for the commonjs spec
[10:45] Ezku\: which promise implementation are you guys using btw?
[10:45] tmedema: wondering the same
[10:45] augustl: Ezku\: I'm currently working on a larger project where we have our own implementation
[10:46] augustl: I've used https://github.com/kriszyp/node-promise as well
[10:48] tmedema: augustl: I don't understand how such libary can know when all callbacks have fired
[10:48] tmedema: can they?
[10:48] augustl: it's not drop-in like that
[10:49] augustl: you have to wrap the mysql bindings, or use a mysql lib that already supports promises
[10:49] augustl: a common pattern is to have i.e. foo(function () {}); or var promise = foo();
[10:49] augustl: i.e. the same function returns a promise if no callback is given
[10:49] tmedema: augustl: alright
[10:50] augustl: then you can do promise.all([promiseA, promiseB, promiseC]).then(function () {});
[10:50] augustl: the then function will be called when all the promises are "resolved", i.e. called

[10:56] augustl: there are also ways to do actual error handling with promises by not resolving them but doing something else
[10:57] TomsB has joined the channel
[10:58] augustl: by calling reject instead of resolve
[10:58] tmedema: augustl: well that's an easy one though, I am calling one function with a callback which then gets called multiple times until all clients have responded
[10:58] tmedema: also, after initiating the function, it is possible that more clients connect
[10:58] tmedema: thus the count is dynamic
[10:59] augustl: sure, promises aren't the end of all ;)
[11:00] tmedema: augustl: so I guess I should just do a if (counter == getMaxClients()) finalCallback();
[11:00] tmedema: inside that callback that is called multiple times
[11:00] TomsB:  Error: Socket.end() called already; cannot write.

[16:08] tbranyen: clean looking

[16:09] tjholowaychuk: and relay the event/data

[16:32] JimBastard: i have no fucking idea why wheat is doing that, its 100% in the blog app

[16:33] intel_ix: Just converts it into a number
[16:34] JimBastard: pquerna: i have literally no idea why that happened, do you think its possible that after your first connection it somehow fixes itself? a couple of people reported same issue

[17:19] A_Nub: Aikar: bookmark google?

[17:20] Aikar: yarp!
[17:20] Aikar: i meant that lib
[17:20] bingomanatee: I'm sure when I get the basics working I will do precalcuations  for the whole grid and bake them in mingo
[17:20] Aikar: still got a while before i would need that for my project, but even if i dont use it its good research :P

[17:59] beriberikix: indutny: ya, that works if I run them on diff ports. Is there a way to run them from the same win? A trailing '&' doesn't seem to do the trick
[18:00] andi5: Doesn't it?
[18:00] indutny: beriberikix: are you trying to run them on same port?
[18:00] ElDios: andi5 it ignores what you told him
[18:00] ElDios: s/him/it
[18:00] V1: tjholowaychuk: Yeh I totally understand that, I'm just gonna do a quick and dirty hack, adding "quit.test.js" to my test suite that cleans the servers. If I have time I'll see if i can add a "finish" hook to express
[18:01] tjholowaychuk: V1: I started a rewrite so that its not all shoved in expresso(1)
[18:01] tjholowaychuk: but
[18:01] tjholowaychuk: yeah got bored of that too
[18:01] tjholowaychuk: haha
[18:01] tjholowaychuk: might finish it some time
[18:01] beriberikix: indutny: nope. trust trying to run them from the same console. When the server launches, it takes over the stdin

[18:10] felixge: ryah: cleanup will only remove the event listeners, it won't called end() on the destination stream
[18:10] felixge: ryah: I had problems pumping to files where the files never got closed
[18:10] ryah: indutny: msotly in tls.js - i think you need a new binding to "inherit" a new SSL* from a SSL_CTX
[18:11] felixge: and it's because the connection doesn't emit "end" but only "close" instead sometimes
[18:11] felixge: and pipe() doesn't handle that
[18:11] indutny: ryah: k, I'll think more
[18:11] andi5: ElDios: Thanks
[18:11] ryah: felixge: ah, yeah - i guess
[18:11] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: hey.  any idea what might be necessary to get jscoverage to compile on solaris?
[18:11] ElDios: andi5 you're welcome ;) is it workin now?
[18:11] MacDiva_ has joined the channel
[18:11] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: no clue
[18:11] felixge: ryah: what's the proper way to fix? Listen to "end" and "close", but only call end() on the destination once?
[18:11] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: it seems like it's failing at the part where it's compiling spidermonkey, but we've got a spidermonkey already on the system.
[18:12] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: the thing that's lame is that it means that no packages that depend on expresso can be installed on no.de
[18:12] felixge: ryah: I think I know how to patch this, I'll go ahead
[18:12] ElDios: felixge something like --> on('end',function(){ if (object.stillOpen) object.close() } ;
[18:12] sechrist: felixge: do you still do php work?
[18:13] ryah: felixge: have a flag to see if end()'s been called
[18:13] ElDios: or the other way round :)
[18:13] felixge: sechrist: hardly
[18:13] andi5: ElDIos: Yes, as expected, just 1 line change. 
[18:13] ElDios: andi5 neat! :)

[18:14] tjholowaychuk: havent tried node-canvas on their either
[18:15] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: that's strange about SM. they shouldn't depend on expresso anyway
[18:15] tjholowaychuk: it takes way to long
[18:15] tjholowaychuk: and its just a dev dep
[18:15] kmwallio has joined the channel
[18:15] jgv has joined the channel
[18:15] tjholowaychuk: but I do think a few put it in "dependencies" for some reason

[18:15] pyrotechnick1 has joined the channel
[18:15] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: also, if you do `npm set npat`, then you get dev deps as well
[18:15] isaacs: since it runs tests on installation
[18:16] tjholowaychuk: gotcha
[18:16] pifantastic has joined the channel
[18:16] isaacs: is there a way to tell it to use the system-installed SM?
[18:16] isaacs: (ideally, we'd do jscoverage using v8, rather than installing another interpreter)
[18:16] tjholowaychuk: yeah ideally ditch the c all together
[18:16] tjholowaychuk: not really a reason for it
[18:17] piscisaureus: felixge: when does that happen (a socket not emitting end)?
[18:17] pquerna has joined the channel
[18:17] felixge: piscisaureus: I have a http server where I listen to 'connection' and 'request' events
[18:17] V1: I'm an idiot.. I have been debugging a non issue for 40 mins now, just because I'm blind and missed 1 single char -_-'
[18:17] felixge: piscisaureus: each incoming request I respond to with: res.writeHead(200, {connection: 'close'})
[18:18] felixge: piscisaureus: the client honors that and closes the connection
[18:18] mape: V1: ; is important! just as isaacs ;D
[18:18] felixge: piscisaureus: but the connection object only emits a "close" event, no "end"

[18:19] isaacs: V1: put the meaningful delimiters at the beginning of lines, so that you can see them.
[18:19] mape: V1: What about it?
[18:20] isaacs: qbert: yes.
[18:20] isaacs: qbert: install your require()-able dependencies into your project
[18:20] V1: isaacs: to bad the jslint doesn't like that preference
[18:20] TomsB has joined the channel
[18:20] V1: mape: it's still a secret! :D
[18:20] isaacs: qbert: install cli apps using --global (or -g)
[18:20] felixge: piscisaureus: does that make sense?
[18:20] isaacs: V1: when you use a style that is easy to visually verify, linters become less necessary.
[18:20] piscisaureus: felixge: my gut feeling is saying no, but I'm still figuring it out
[18:21] felixge: piscisaureus: I can provide a test case
[18:21] piscisaureus: felixge: let me think a bit
[18:21] isaacs: V1: but if you're using a linter, how did it take you 40 minutes to find a single missing char? ;P

[18:22] qbert: isaacs, kk thx, this is to remove global dependencies when installing on other servers ?
[18:23] piscisaureus: felixge: I would think node only implicitly closes the socket after either a graceful disconnect *or* a socket error.
[18:23] felixge: piscisaureus: I think there is a graceful disconnection when sending {Connection: "close"} to a client, no?
[18:23] piscisaureus: felixge: So you should see either a 'end' or a 'error' event prior to  the socket being closed
[18:23] felixge: piscisaureus: even if I call destroy() or end() on the socket, I still get no end event
[18:23] felixge: no error event
[18:23] felixge: that would blow up
[18:24] felixge: I'd have noticed it
[18:24] TomsB: Why I am getting this error?
[18:24] TomsB: Error: Socket.end() called already; cannot write.
[18:24] V1: isaacs: I'm not using a linter because they always complain about my personal coding preferences :p
[18:25] TomsB: I am checking for socket.writable...
[18:25] piscisaureus: felixge: does the close event give you hadError = true?
[18:25] isaacs: qbert: this is to make a lot of things simpler, but that's one use-case thatis better served by this new architecture, yes
[18:25] isaacs: V1: you're tellin me!!
[18:25] felixge: piscisaureus: good question, let me check
[18:27] felixge: piscisaureus: nope, it's false
[18:27] felixge: piscisaureus: let me know if you want an isolated test for this

[18:29] intel_ix: or is it suposed to do that.
[18:29] felixge: btw. I just found another flaw in pipe()
[18:30] intel_ix: like something to do with registers or w/e
[18:30] felixge: if multiple readable streams are piped to the same writeable stream
[18:30] felixge: the pipe will call end() on the destination, effectively breaking all remaining pipes
[18:30] felixge: not sure if that's desirable
[18:31] hornairs has joined the channel
[18:31] hij1nx has joined the channel

[18:36] A_Nub1: V1
[18:36] A_Nub1: well I havent logged it
[18:36] A_Nub1: I would just hit refresh
[18:36] A_Nub1: and the error would go away
[18:36] A_Nub1: it only happens occasionally.
[18:36] A_Nub1: next time ill be sure to log it
[18:37] A_Nub1: im using port 8080 right now
[18:37] intel_ix: A_Nub1: Use the raw library, it's better ._.
[18:37] A_Nub1: intel_ix: websockets dont support raw connections.
[18:37] CiRlE has joined the channel
[18:37] intel_ix: I mean, socket io has an abstraction layer
[18:37] V1: A_Nub1: I have done some testing on my own, with port 4000. And about 4.50% of all our users are unable to connect to that port due to proxies
[18:37] intel_ix: It has fallbacks and stuff
[18:37] intel_ix: Not fully websocket
[18:37] V1: Port 80 is not point what so ever
[18:37] intel_ix: it also has random stuff like logging

[18:43] shoebat: i am..
[18:43] A_Nub1: then whats the problem??
[18:44] shoebat: i guess im unsure which is the MAIN one..
[18:44] A_Nub1: Well I think you are looking at it wrong then
[18:44] shoebat: say i have http://localhost/blah.php
[18:44] A_Nub1: it seems you have php generating the client.
[18:44] shoebat: which parses some php stuff.. and i want a node chatroom IN THERE
[18:44] A_Nub1: and node is just handling message dispersion.

[19:24] synkro: is Math.random() good enough for crypto?
[19:24] blueadept: tjholowaychuk: do you contribute to mongoose?
[19:25] aho: synkro, it's initialized with the current time
[19:25] aho: so eh... bad choice :>
[19:25] V1: Hmzz when I send Buffer.toString() over a memcached TCP connection, and receive it, i will be missing 5 bytes :!
[19:25] tyler-iphone: fibonacci = function(n){
[19:25] tyler-iphone: 	return Math.round(Math.pow((Math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2, Math.abs(n)) / Math.sqrt(5)) * (n < 0 && n % 2 ? -1 : 1);
[19:25] tyler-iphone: };
[19:25] A_Nub1: synkro: there are crypto modules.
[19:25] andi5: tjholowaychuk: Is there a way to create Array instances, if the object only has integer keys?
[19:26] Billbad has joined the channel
[19:26] synkro: aho(); could be worse
[19:26] A_Nub1: synkro: and writing a simple crypto algo wouldnt be hard
[19:26] saschagehlich: did anyone ever get a "Parse Error" causing connections staying in FIN_WAIT2 which causes an EMFILE (too many files open)?
[19:26] sdecastelberg has joined the channel
[19:26] A_Nub1: synkro: Math.random isnt good it doesnt have a seed or a way to reverse
[19:26] synkro: A_Nub1(); there is no random function in the crypto module
[19:26] tjholowaychuk: andi5: you can iterate them and set the array
[19:26] adulteratedjedi has joined the channel
[19:26] aho: my prng of choice is xorshift (even if it's kinda awful with js)
[19:26] tjholowaychuk: andi5: nothing fancy
[19:26] A_Nub1: synkro: why do you want random?
[19:27] A_Nub1: how would you decode it?
[19:27] synkro: as salt for my hashes
[19:27] A_Nub1: I repeat
[19:27] A_Nub1: How do you replicate.
[19:27] A_Nub1: salt is something known
[19:27] A_Nub1: only by the server.
[19:27] jacobolus has joined the channel
[19:27] A_Nub1: if its random
[19:28] synkro: yes but the salt should be sufficent random
[19:28] A_Nub1: you could never compare.
[19:28] tyler-iphone: aho: https://github.com/maxogden/node-prng-server
[19:28] aho: synkro, cat + keyboard
[19:28] A_Nub1: salt needs to be static or able to be regenerated.
[19:28] A_Nub1: salt can't be random.
[19:29] A_Nub1: otherwise it just will make useless hashes.
[19:29] synkro: huh? it should be another salt for every hash
[19:29] aho: tyler-iphone, i just use that prng for games ;)
[19:29] A_Nub1: synkro: why?
[19:29] aho: it's comparable to the mersenne twister
[19:29] andi5: tjholowaychuk: No big deal, but should work automatically
[19:29] doki_pen: maybe he means the initial creation of salt should be random?
[19:29] tjholowaychuk: andi5: nah
[19:29] synkro: A_Nub1(); an attack then will need a rainbow table for every salt
[19:30] tjholowaychuk: this aint ruby man
[19:30] tjholowaychuk: dont expect magic
[19:30] tjholowaychuk: embrace the non-magic :D
[19:30] A_Nub1: synkro: write a simple algo to jumble your hashes ;)
[19:30] synkro: what does "jumble hashes" mean?
[19:30] A_Nub1: a hash is a string
[19:31] tfe_ has joined the channel
[19:31] tfe_ has joined the channel
[19:31] A_Nub1: use the hash to manipulate itself
[19:31] A_Nub1: or be manipulated by a pattern
[19:31] A_Nub1: and only have that code on the server
[19:31] A_Nub1: or run a series of hashes
[19:31] A_Nub1: no one will be able to reverse those.
[19:31] A_Nub1: its nonsense
[19:32] synkro: hmm... I'll think about it
[19:32] A_Nub1: sha1("saltysalt"+md5("saltedcrackers"+value))
[19:32] A_Nub1: that should be enough
[19:32] A_Nub1: to avoid any reversal
[19:32] arpegius has joined the channel
[19:32] dve has joined the channel
[19:32] synkro: A_Nub1(); I agree
[19:33] blueadept: what about using a 512 hash?
[19:33] A_Nub1: my point is
[19:33] A_Nub1: as long as it stays serverside, the algo used
[19:33] A_Nub1: its secure.
[19:33] A_Nub1: just make it nonsense
[19:33] stisti has joined the channel
[19:33] A_Nub1: it doesnt have to make alot of sense
[19:34] A_Nub1: to how it works
[19:34] A_Nub1: the less sense the algo makes
[19:34] A_Nub1: the more it works
[19:34] A_Nub1: Now if you are wanting to encrypt data
[19:34] A_Nub1: you have to change the technique a bit
[19:35] A_Nub1: the idea is to jumble the data based on a key
[19:35] A_Nub1: how you do it doesnt matter
[19:35] Sbioko has joined the channel
[19:35] Sbioko: hello guys
[19:35] A_Nub1: just so long as its reversable using the key
[19:35] Sbioko: how to get the content of remote file?
[19:35] aho: md5(value + ' dfxGTRGSFCXV4t$%&SXfd')
[19:35] Sbioko: this is .txt file
[19:35] aho: is good enough
[19:35] Sbioko: Node.js v0.4.x
[19:35] doki_pen: Sbioko: with http?
[19:35] Sbioko: doki_pen: yeah
[19:36] Epeli: how does one render plain html with Jade templates? eg. google analytics code
[19:36] doki_pen: Sbioko: google http.createClient
[19:36] tjholowaychuk: Epeli: one sec
[19:36] mscdex: it's http.request now
[19:36] mscdex: :)
[19:37] A_Nub1: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.5/api/http.html#http.ServerRequest
[19:37] doki_pen: mscdex: oh man!
[19:37] doki_pen: everything changes so fast!
[19:37] Sbioko: so ServerRequest?
[19:37] mscdex: Sbioko: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.6/api/http.html#http.request
[19:37] tjholowaychuk: Epeli: https://gist.github.com/a60257ff40525f87f23d
[19:37] A_Nub1: Epeli: http://jade-lang.com/
[19:37] blueadept: tjholowaychuk: would you happen to know why this timestamp is being created as null, when it works for non-nested fields? http://pastie.org/private/hfrpcuzvkptt3qew3cfdg is this a bug, or am i doing it wrong?
[19:37] Sbioko: thx all
[19:38] A_Nub1: Epeli: https://github.com/visionmedia/jade heres the source to it
[19:38] tjholowaychuk: Epeli: you can add raw html to any text block, so trailing "." means it's text-only, or use pipes etc
[19:38] tjholowaychuk: Epeli: or just convert it to jade instead
[19:38] tjholowaychuk: blueadept: dunno
[19:38] doki_pen: mscdex: but createRequest still works, right?
[19:39] doki_pen: *createClient
[19:40] mscdex: doki_pen: yes, but it's recommended that people use http.request now, since 0.4.x
[19:40] sdecastelberg has joined the channel
[19:40] doki_pen: mscdex: what do people do about libraries that are used accross versions?
[19:40] Sbioko: maybe there are other solutions?
[19:41] Sbioko: simplier?
[19:41] piscisaureus has left the channel
[19:41] Sbioko: simpler
[19:41] doki_pen: Sbioko: sorry, it's going to be async, it's node!
[19:41] Sbioko: like file_get_contents('http://remote/text.txt');
[19:41] Sbioko: in PHP
[19:41] Sbioko: yeah, I know
[19:41] box2 has joined the channel
[19:41] Sbioko: no modules for that?
[19:41] doki_pen: Sbioko: what are you doing that you wouldn't want async?
[19:41] Sbioko: yeah, I want async :-D
[19:41] mscdex: doki_pen: depends on the module author. some put more effort into keeping compatibility than others
[19:42] NuckingFuts has joined the channel
[19:42] mscdex: Sbioko: yes, look at the http.request example in the docs
[19:42] tbranyen: doki_pen: shell script? might be easier to just do synchronous
[19:42] Sbioko: mscdex: ok, how to get the whole response? not just chunk as in the example
[19:42] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[19:42] mscdex: Sbioko: buffer the chunks if you need to then
[19:43] doki_pen: Sbioko: here is an example: https://github.com/embedly/embedly-node/blob/master/lib/embedly.js#L97
[19:43] hij1nx_ has joined the channel
[19:43] mscdex: Sbioko: if it's text, just have a blank text variable that you append each chunk to
[19:43] doki_pen: Sbioko: just look at the data collection part
[19:43] mscdex: Sbioko: then when the response's 'end' event fires, do something with the contents of your buffer variable
[19:43] Sbioko: yeah I got it
[19:43] Sbioko: thanks!

[19:44] stisti: Hi! I'm a javascript and node newbie. I wrote a script and have been trying to make it faster than a perl script that does the same. Could someone give me some tips on what I could improve? Most of time seems to be spent in utf8 string allocation, which is strange because I'm using Buffers. Please comment at https://github.com/stisti/nodestuff/blob/master/sha256.js

[19:45] box2: stisti: he was talking to NuckingFuts 
[19:46] stisti: oh, sorry
[19:46] NuckingFuts: mscdex: I meant it's supposed to be faster to use an array then .join() it
[19:46] NuckingFuts: Isn't it?
[19:46] Sbioko: http://pastie.org/1795528
[19:46] chrisdickinson: stisti: taking a look
[19:46] Sbioko: what am I doing wrong?
[19:46] Sbioko: Nothing in console and in browser

[19:50] Sbioko: nope
[19:50] Sbioko: NuckingFuts: why?
[19:51] doki_pen: probably string concat
[19:51] V1: Sbioko: you sure your res.send() is called?
[19:51] Sbioko: V1: nope
[19:51] mscdex: Sbioko: https://gist.github.com/b548869e172dee905ea7

[19:54] mscdex: whether you do it explicitly or v8 does it
[19:54] Sbioko: u are awsm
[19:54] doki_pen: mscdex: but each time a new string is alloc'd
[19:54] mscdex: meh
[19:54] doki_pen: mscdex: causes gc, no?
[19:54] alexgordon has joined the channel
[19:54] doki_pen: mscdex: try it with 1kk strings and see the diff
[19:55] NuckingFuts: Yeah, I figure it's best to just .join() whenever feasible :B
[19:55] mscdex: i think you'd probably have more serious bottlenecks before string concatenation becomes a major issue
[19:55] doki_pen: Sbioko: if you have big files, then append data to and array and then do .join('') in 'end' event
[19:55] doki_pen: mscdex: it's not the concat
[19:55] Sbioko: doki_pen: ok, thanks :-)

[20:08] tedsuo has joined the channel
[20:08] a|i: V1: any other libs comparable to now.js? I'm trying to make a chat-room-like app, wanted to evaluate available libs.
[20:09] A_Nub1 has left the channel
[20:09] V1: Well you can just use socket.io for chat, you don't really need now.js for that..
[20:09] techwraith: a|i: DNode is there
[20:09] V1: You also have dnode that is build on top of socket.io as well
[20:09] techwraith: but yeah, socket.io is really what you're looking for
[20:09] a|i: thanks.
[20:09] techwraith: unless you need a persistant namespace between the server and client for storing variables and functions...
[20:10] V1: nowjs and dnode are basiclly frameworks that allows your server to call clientside functions or the other way around
[20:10] V1: + state syncing
[20:10] a|i: why now.js says beta suppoert for ie < 9? doesn't socket.io fallback to flash or something?
[20:10] jonaslund has joined the channel
[20:10] techwraith: Yeah, it works just fine
[20:11] V1: a|i: because nowjs also ships with a HUGE now.js file, that mmight not be compatible with older browser versions
[20:11] V1: Socket.IO is compatible for IE 5.5 > IE 9 etc <insert your fav browser here>
[20:11] techwraith: Oh, nowjs, nevermind
[20:11] a|i: you mean the clientside .js file has a big file size, or the lib is too big?
[20:12] cloudhead2 has joined the channel
[20:12] V1: client
[20:12] a|i: any performance measurements, benchmarking, any stats at all for nowjs or dnode performance, eg how many concurrent connections they can handle?
[20:13] V1: thousands 
[20:13] gxblast_ has joined the channel
[20:14] RusAlex has left the channel
[20:14] V1: but it always depends on the application you are building on top of the frameworks
[20:15] a|i: flash media server (which is basically js + c++ like node) can handle thousands per decent server instance, but it also pushes video images too. I would expect nodejs to be faster than fms?
[20:15] creationix has joined the channel

[20:19] a|i: any real-world real-time apps built on top of nodejs which has many many users?
[20:19] a|i: bradleymeck: you mean rtmp is more effcient than http for data pushing?

[20:25] iFire has joined the channel
[20:25] V1: cloudhead: you are using a polling transport

[20:26] V1: cloudhead: you will probably notice, if you are using a websocket connection, that you do have access to the client.request object
[20:26] cloudhead: V1: yea, it's just when it drops to xhr that I have this problem
[20:26] cloudhead: V1: but I need to check the cookies to authenticate the user
[20:26] V1: let me guess, you are trying to read out cookies 
[20:27] V1: ha! I'm a mind reader
[20:27] cloudhead: yes ^.^
[20:27] jimt has joined the channel
[20:27] V1: I would say, there is no way to do that reliable at this point. Without making some considerable hack to the code

[20:31] bradleymeck: ... odd person
[20:31] box2: yes... odd
[20:31] cloudhead: V1: so basicaly, when an xhr client reconnects, it might not send headers?
[20:32] V1: cloudhead, when a user connects to socket.io for the first time, socket.io will send back a response, with the session id
[20:32] V1: cloudhead: and because it sends a message the browser will just close the connection and your request would be gone.

[20:42] cloudhead: I think a simpler way to specify what events you want to listen to would be nice though, like the ability to maybe just pass an array as the 2nd param, which would be equivalent to `{info:only: [...]}`
[20:42] konobi has joined the channel
[20:43] cloudhead: or better, have it intelligently know 'error' should be logged as an error, and 'success' as `info` and 'data' as `debug`
[20:44] dmcquay has joined the channel
[20:44] cloudhead: that could be customizable at the module level
[20:44] devdazed: i can set that in the defaults.  it already automatically logs error and error and everything else as info.  making it do data as debug would be trivial
[20:44] cloudhead: eventful.configure({ error: 'error', data: 'debug', ...})
[20:44] devdazed: when you create a new instance of Eventful, you can pass in the defaults. that will be applied to all attaches
[20:44] cloudhead: cool
[20:44] cloudhead: that's good
[20:46] devdazed: it does it the correct way too, by using non-enumerable properties so if you happen to enumerate your emitter, it wont break existing code
[20:46] devdazed: also, it doesnt use listeners, so you wont get any unnecessary warnings or issues 
[20:47] a|i: when hosting node and a web app, eg rails, on the same host, does node has to use a port other than 80?
[20:47] rsms has joined the channel
[20:47] tbranyen: a|i: not if you proxy it
[20:48] a|i: tbranyen: how about performance?
[20:48] tbranyen: i have no idea you'd have to test it
[20:48] devdazed: nginx is great for proxying
[20:48] a|i: putting nginx in the middle just to support port 80
[20:48] tbranyen: you don't have to run it on port 80
[20:48] devdazed: i have an app that (on a high cpu xlrg on amazon) can do 15k/secong with nginx load balancing
[20:48] tbranyen: thats complete a cosmetic reason
[20:48] a|i: hat I meanis, is it ok for node to use port 81 or something, and the js client has to communicate through port 81?
[20:48] tbranyen: completely*
[20:49] tbranyen: a|i: sure use websockets or jsonp
[20:49] geoffeg has joined the channel
[20:49] tbranyen: or something that isn't affected by the SOP
[20:49] devdazed: a|i: be careful about using non-standard ports though.  your users could be behind a firewall
[20:50] a|i: devdazed: taht's exactly why I asked this question.
[20:51] devdazed: if you want to run it beside rails or somehting then run it on a different port and use a reverse proxy like nginx to forward the correct requests to node or rails
[20:51] a|i: devdazed: sure, just wondering if the extra step of nginx could be avoided
[20:52] devdazed: not really, but nginx is so lightweight that you wont see a performance hit, especially when using rails
[20:52] JeffWillden_ has joined the channel
[20:52] doki_pen: is there a decent websocket client lib for node?
[20:52] a|i: devdazed: how would a request to node , or rails can be serapated from each other? based on path or what?
[20:52] tbranyen: a|i: how could two servers serve on the same port?
[20:52] devdazed: liek i said, i use it on a machine that does 15k per second
[20:52] a|i: tbranyen: I wish they could share a port :)
[20:53] tbranyen: doki_pen: no there are no decent libraries none might as well not even google...
[20:53] clee: you could split it by virtualhost, instead of path
[20:53] a|i: devdazed: so how is it possible to distinguish betweeh webapp request and node requests?
[20:54] devdazed: nginx can do it by path
[20:54] ewdafa has joined the channel
[20:54] a|i: okay.
[20:54] devdazed: so you put in the config /node goes to node app running on port 8000 and /everything else goes to rails app on 3000
[20:54] a|i: devdazed: I see.
[20:54] doki_pen: tbranyen: of course, I found some googling, I want opinion
[20:55] a|i: is there something like appengine for node?

[20:57] techwraith: It's great for developing on, but it's not super powerful
[20:57] techwraith: for a production type app, it would be best to upgrade to a smartmachine

[21:01] devdazed: my bash script pulls from git, and just does everything else via ssh

[21:02] devdazed: yeah, i looked at wayne sequins BDSM
[21:02] devdazed: but the lack of documentation makes it difficult
[21:02] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: heh it sucks when my no.de reload fails because of something wrong on the server and i need to do whitespace commit to restart

[21:18] tbranyen: something like that maybe?

[21:18] devdazed: like this maybe: function process(ary){ if (ary.length){ process(ary.pop) } }

[21:56] mtsl: well, the name of dreamweaver is cool, but it creates nightmares instead :)
[21:56] Jckf: But back to the topic: I use Notepad++
[21:56] devdazed: tjholowaychuk: i guess you can polish a turd
[21:56] devdazed: haha

[21:56] tjholowaychuk: you can put spoilers on a turd
[21:56] tjholowaychuk: and stickers
[21:56] devdazed: dreamweaver is great for designer who dont know how to write html
[21:57] devdazed: that is all
[21:57] tjholowaychuk: hardly even great at that
[21:57] devdazed: hahaah
[21:57] cognominal: my hunch is that dreamweaver catters to a population very different from nojs people. See the previous cat/dogs analogy
[21:57] mtsl: devdazed, I agree. So they shouldn't think of using node at all ;)

[21:58] Nexxy: dreamweaver caters to the influx of "professional web designers" that have come about since the dot com bubble
[21:59] Nexxy: as in, "I took a VC course @ my local community college! I am now a web designer!"
[21:59] devdazed: and high school kids that refer to themselves as "ninja" or "rockstar"

[22:02] Nexxy: devdazed; I don't think getting to know other devs a little better is called 'hooking up' per se
[22:02] Twelve-60: so uh.. anyone wnat to get the official way to append a string to a filee?
[22:02] devdazed: Nexxy: it was in jest
[22:03] devdazed: Twelve-60: how is that?
[22:03] devdazed: i was just asking about this ealier btw
[22:03] Nexxy: just making sure ;3 sorry if I responded too seriously, i'm  just used to the ruby community
[22:03] Twelve-60: devdazed: fs.write(fd, "test", null, null, null, callback) ?

[22:04] devdazed: Twelve-60: that required a file descriptor.  i was actually looking for a convienience method to do it all at once
[22:04] Twelve-60: i dont understand why there isn't a fs.puts(string, callback) :/
[22:04] Twelve-60: well im using fs.open
[22:04] Twelve-60: to get the fd
[22:04] devdazed: similiar to rubys 1 line file append
[22:04] Twelve-60: but the callback is never calling from fs.write
[22:04] Twelve-60: so i gueess im doing it wrong or the callback doesnt work for strings
[22:04] Twelve-60: :/
[22:05] Nexxy: use an array!
[22:06] devdazed: Twelve-60: are you trying to write a buffer?
[22:06] devdazed: fs.write takes a buffer
[22:06] Twelve-60: devdazed: no a string :P
[22:07] Twelve-60: i dont see any other methods
[22:07] Twelve-60: O_o
[22:07] devdazed: Twelve-60: also make not that the first argument of the callback is an error, then the number of bytes written
[22:07] saikat has joined the channel
[22:08] Twelve-60: devdazed: yeah i do

[22:19] Twelve-60: im on*
[22:19] devdazed: ryah: and idea why WriteStream open is returning an int and not a filedescriptor?
[22:20] mjr_: cloudhead: hmm, sounds like a bug
[22:20] mjr_: I haven't tested unsubscribe much
[22:20] Twelve-60: no changelog for 0.4.6 ?
[22:20] ryah: devdazed: ?
[22:20] cloudhead: mjr_: ok, I just do `sub.unsubscribe(); sub.quit()` and I get that
[22:21] rsms has left the channel
[22:21] devdazed: ryah: according to the docs, the open event for WriteStream returnd the fd

[22:22] tjholowaychuk: devdazed: whenever you see "fd", it's an int

[22:24] doubletap has left the channel
[22:24] piscisaureus: 01devdazed: it is not 100% correct still. you must not call close on the stream immediately after write.
[22:24] tbranyen: http://jsfiddle.net/YJzFC/4/ techwraith or something like that to feed in the arrays from an outside source

[22:25] devdazed: piscisaureus: nevermind, i see i should have used the callback
[22:25] devdazed: or that
[22:26] cloudhead: mjr_: so it quits on its own when you unsub?
