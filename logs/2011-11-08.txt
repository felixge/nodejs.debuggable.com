[00:09] mrshogun: chilts you are completely right :)
[00:09] mrshogun: so
[00:09] mrshogun: from the people that had some experience with vows, what is your opinion about it? is it a good framework to test a server application?
[00:09] mrshogun: :)
[00:10] chilts: funny thing is, I'm about to pick vows for testing a webapp ... though I currently don't know much about using it
[00:10] chilts: I've use tap for testing libraries, but not tried doing web apps yet :)

[00:12] mrshogun: hmm
[00:12] mrshogun: im going to start using it soon
[00:12] sarlalian: seems like a lot of projects are using vows
[00:12] mrshogun: yeap
[00:12] sarlalian: but it could be because I'm mostly using projects from the same group of people and they use vows
[00:13] mrshogun: thats why im thinking about choosing it to mine
[00:13] rektide: isaacs: point of interest, this is a VPN system running 2.6.26... just a thought that maybe that old kernel version might be why node isn't doing spawn??
[00:13] mrshogun: sarlalian did you manage to do some sort of continuous integration with vows?
[00:14] isaacs: rektide: what's 2.6.26?
[00:14] rektide: spawn doesn't seem like it'd be an advanced requirement, but i dunno
[00:14] rektide: isaacs: linux 2.6.26
[00:14] isaacs: rektide: oh, ok

[00:47] fzzzy has joined the channel
[00:47] RORgasm: ok
[00:47] mrshogun: a example is when you make a request and while the server is processing that request it crashes

[00:48] mrshogun: i dont have any idea about what you are doing
[00:48] mrshogun: or what you are using :)
[00:48] RORgasm: basically what's going on this
[00:48] mrshogun: it happens to me every time i make a request from one of my servers to the other
[00:48] mrshogun: and the second one crashes
[00:48] RORgasm: mrshogun: how are u dealing with it?
[00:49] jesusabdullah: Hey everybody, I'm trying to interact with google's oauth2 api and I'm doing it wrong:

[00:53] RORgasm: every now and then i'm getting that socket hang up error
[00:54] RORgasm: i have a global exception hadnelr
[00:54] RORgasm: but i feel like eventually
[00:54] mrshogun: hmm
[00:54] RORgasm: mongoose stops updating the db
[00:54] RORgasm: but when i restart the server
[00:54] mrshogun: did you try to debug it and check where is it getting the rror?
[00:54] mrshogun: ah
[00:54] RORgasm: the importing of FB friends works again
[00:54] mrshogun: mogoose crashes
[00:54] RORgasm: i'm not sure if the problem wish with the Facebook api or mongoose
[00:54] RORgasm: since in my method, i'm using both
[00:54] RORgasm: and can't quite tell from teh trace
[00:54] mrshogun: hmmm
[00:55] mrshogun: try to use node-inspector to debug
[00:55] mrshogun: maybe ull see sth that is not obvious
[00:55] mrshogun: but i could bet that the problem is in mongoose if it stops working after you get a socket hang up
[00:56] mrshogun: btw try to handle the exceptions in the context of the operations
[00:56] RORgasm: i know
[00:56] RORgasm: i know
[00:56] mrshogun: is not good to have a general handler :/

[00:59] RORgasm: the query is fine
[00:59] RORgasm: it makes the query fine
[01:00] RORgasm: its in teh callback function
[01:00] domino141: i'm using socket.io and i have it set to try 10 times when it disconnects, on the client side, to reconnect again. it's easy to simulate this by turning off the node server and restarting it, and  i get the correct behavior.  but now i want to do the same on the client side
[01:00] RORgasm: where it takes the result of the query and update/screates records where i think this is happening
[01:00] RORgasm: yeah
[01:00] domino141: if i shut off my laptop for like 10 minutes and turn it back on, what happens? will the server try to keep reconnecting?
[01:00] RORgasm: at that point i feel that i've already gotten the info from facebook
[01:00] domino141: rather i'd like to reconnect from the client, but how do i get the state of the socket after 10 mins?
[01:00] RORgasm: mrshogun: so feeling more andmore liek its something up with the create or update part of the process
[01:01] mrshogun: RORgasm really try to debug with node-inspector
[01:01] mrshogun: i feel ull find the problem in 5m
[01:01] RORgasm: mrshogun: you think so?
[01:01] mrshogun: y
[01:01] RORgasm: hmm
[01:01] gregpascale has joined the channel
[01:02] mrshogun: i dont believe a database as Mongo might have such a problem in uptading or creating registers
[01:02] RORgasm: no i don't think that's the problem either
[01:02] mrshogun: i think the problem is in ur code
[01:02] RORgasm: but i'm not sure if its the connection to the db
[01:02] RORgasm: from either mongolab's side or mine
[01:02] RORgasm: hmm
[01:02] RORgasm: mrshogun: u know i noticed one thing
[01:02] mrshogun: ull just know after debugging :D
[01:02] mrshogun: what?
[01:03] domino141: lots of mongo fud out there
[01:03] RORgasm: so i wrote a sepereat node script where i jsut did the creat or update part for each account
[01:03] RORgasm: and i kept on seein gthe socket on hang error
[01:03] RORgasm: but then i saw it one more time..after it ran for a while
[01:03] RORgasm: and then i feel like mongoose or something stopped responding
[01:03] mrshogun: hmm
[01:03] RORgasm: but i'm gonna run the node-inspector with the update node script
[01:03] RORgasm: i need to get some food
[01:04] RORgasm: :)
[01:04] RORgasm: i'll be back in a bit

[03:19] alejandromg: multi:true

[04:08] alejandromg: 2.4.6 I think, let me check
[04:09] alejandromg: paul___: You mean, have a schema that has another schema?

[08:10] DennisRasmussen has joined the channel
[08:11] eddyb: AFAIK, anyone can monkey-patch (I think that's how it's called) the module module to support more extensions (possibly by passing them thru compilers)
[08:12] AAA_awright: monkey-patch is literally changing the logic at runtime, require just uses an Object of functions to handle various extensions
[08:13] itsmeoverhere: Hiya all, noob on node.js trying to use jQuery. I seem to need an node-waf, how do I get it on my windows machine?

[08:14] Pbaba: Hello Everyone.
[08:14] Marko__: so how would you actually do it?
[08:14] AAA_awright: But I still wouldn't advise using coffeescript. Ever.

[08:15] Pbaba: Hi Marko__ 
[08:16] captain_morgan has joined the channel
[08:16] Marko__: its easy to convert to normal js thou, and that can be used in node.js normally i guess

[08:23] Pbaba: So, node.js is something that works on the server end.
[08:24] Pbaba: Well, can I make use of it to create webapps and cloud networks?
[08:24] dexter_e: And "Integrated load balancing over multiple processes."  woohooo
[08:25] shedinja: What do you guys think about coffeescript? I've been making my modules in coffeescript and someone just opened and issue saying they would open a pull request but they don't know coffeescript. That made me reconsider making future modules in javascript again.

[16:19] TheJH: GarfTop, remember the last result of writing. if your write didn't succeed immediately, listen for the drain event or so
[16:19] GarfTop: will listening to the drain actually force the flush?
[16:20] TheJH: GarfTop, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7954394/node-js-stdout-flush/7956360#7956360
[16:20] TheJH: GarfTop, no, it will just wait for the flush to happen

[16:20] scottschecter has joined the channel
[16:20] GarfTop: right, so how do I force the flush?
[16:20] GarfTop: this was possible in 0.4.x
[16:21] TheJH: GarfTop, what do you mean, "force" it? It will enebtually flush itself
[16:21] TheJH: *eventually
[16:21] GarfTop: I want it to flush *now*, not sit around
[16:21] BillyBreen has joined the channel
[16:21] TheJH: GarfTop, it'll do it as soon as possible
[16:21] TheJH: GarfTop, you can't speed it up
[16:22] GarfTop: is that last behavior documented/explained anywhere?
[16:22] GarfTop: stdout can get flushed as late as program exit if you're not careful
[16:22] GarfTop: the documentation says this is enforced for tty and files, but *not* for pipes
[16:23] GarfTop: I have pipes, so I'm suddenly SOL?

[16:47] Aikar: I have a system I wrote in node for work that lets me drop "criteria" in a folder and automatically adds them to the app stack, and the app runs everyone in parrallel. One main fear was if the callback to "finish" was ever forgotten on any criteria, the entire logic would be stalled. with streamline, it enforces that the callback will always be called (soon as the function returns), so gives me alot of safety

[17:01] joshkehn has left the channel
[17:01] paul___: Aikar: can you help me understand the node streamline instructions?
[17:01] paul___: You can run the module with node-streamline myModule or require it as require('myModule') from a program that you launch with node-streamline. If you choose this option, you have to create an empty myModule.js
[17:02] paul___: i'm not really sure exactly what to do here
[17:02] tisba_ has joined the channel
[17:02] dgathright has joined the channel
[17:02] Aikar: paul___: node-streamline overloads require so require auto compiles each file. aurora does same but in a cleaner way imo.
[17:02] devaholic: trose: you could use nodeQuery but its not ready for productio https://github.com/tblobaum/nodeQuery
[17:02] aaronj1335_ has joined the channel
[17:03] Aikar: paul___: what i do is make my _.js files, then aurora <nameofentry.js> instead of node, and then it compiles any file thats needed to be compiled
[17:03] arcanis has joined the channel
[17:03] Aikar: or, just type 'aurora' in root of folder, and it compiles every file in project
[17:03] paul___: Aikar: my main problem is how i can get it working with nodemon or forever to run streamline again
[17:04] Aikar: paul___: main difference is aurora lets you specify what folders have streamlined files, and give diff options
[17:04] paul___: ic
[17:04] Aikar: paul___: just 'aurora' to compile outside of runtime, then run with nodemon/forever
[17:04] Aikar: using those commands should be limited to development only
[17:04] trose: devaholic, oh that's rad
[17:04] Aikar: deployed code shouldnt need the streamline module at all
[17:04] paul___: right
[17:04] k1ttty has joined the channel
[17:05] eb4890 has joined the channel
[17:05] Aikar: (well, in a branch of SL im working on an improved 'runtime' that will be a node_module module, so that will ship as the barebones. removes the code duplication in every files header)
[17:05] paul___: so i run nodemon/forever on the js files… and aurora will auto compile when node is restarted by nodemon/forever ?
[17:05] Aikar: do you 'develop' with forever/nodemon?
[17:05] Aikar: the aurora binary/autocompile is only used when developing
[17:05] paul___: yes, i've been using nodemon lately but for dev
[17:06] Aikar: well, youll need to not use the auto compile on use feature and simply run aurora before running your app
[17:06] devaholic: paull__ did you get setup on 0.6.0?
[17:06] Aikar: ie: aurora && nodemon myapp.js
[17:07] devaholic: paul__ i didnt reply to that issue but the code works, i mean its just the example code
[17:07] Aikar: startup time will be close to the same, just running 'aurora myapp.js' saves you the need to run 2 commands
[17:07] paul___: devaholic yep i was able to upgrade to 0.6.0 when you recommended it but couldn't get node query to work

[18:31] TheJH: winterpk, no
[18:31] TheJH: winterpk, readFile handles closing the file for you
[18:32] winterpk: TheJH: ahh ok, that makes sense now.

[18:41] eddyb: winterpk: you're using a loop?
[18:41] Glenjamin_: i suspect the control flow isn't doing what you think it is
[18:41] eddyb: fs.readFile doesn't block
