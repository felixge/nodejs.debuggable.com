[00:19] aaronblohowiak: beejeebus1: you are not compiling a stable version
[00:19] hij1nx has joined the channel
[00:20] aaronblohowiak: beejeebus1: use 0.4.8
[00:20] beejeebus1: aaronblohowiak: ok, so its not "unstable as in buggy" but "unstable as in it doesn't always compile"
[00:20] beejeebus1: aaronblohowiak: no problem
[00:20] aaronblohowiak: beejeebus1: ^.^ i do not know, but i wouldn't spend any time on it
[00:21] aaronblohowiak: beejeebus1: ryah: may want to know that master doesn't compile on ubuntu natty.
[00:21] beejeebus1: aaronblohowiak: i'm not much of a C++ hacker, but i'd be willing to help bring the error up to ./configure time, rather than during make
[00:22] aaronblohowiak: beejeebus1: see if 0.4.8 compiles cleanly first
[00:23] beejeebus1: aaronblohowiak: yep, it does. this is not about getting a working node.js for production, i'm all set there with 0.4.8
[00:23] aaronblohowiak: beejeebus1: ah, okie dokie.

[01:49] MrNibbles: Tobsn: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601

[01:50] Tobsn: yeah hmm
[01:50] Tobsn: no timezone
[01:51] tuhoojabotti: utc
[01:51] Tobsn: you think?
[01:51] jhurliman: this is more of a general javascript question, but if i have a base url (like http://mysite.com/some/path/page.html) and a relative url (../../another/path/page2.html) is there a handy function lying around that can spit out the combined url?
[01:51] tuhoojabotti: Tobsn: according to m.wikipedia
[01:51] Tobsn: now someone give me an example how to turn that timezone into time passed since that timestamp and local browser time
[01:51] Tobsn: ;)
[01:51] Tobsn: k tuhoojabotti, that helps actually a lot
[01:51] tuhoojabotti: :D

[01:55] MrNibbles: or perhaps too long in the car without a bathroom break
[01:55] Tobsn: NuckingFuts, for what?
[01:55] NuckingFuts: I cannot stand having to use Ruby for this shit.
[01:55] tuhoojabotti: playing I didn't even notice my legs
[01:55] Tobsn: use the console
[01:55] NuckingFuts: Tobsn: I like the Mongo-Web-Admin because it's like console, but it has some useful additions
[01:56] NuckingFuts: Mostly data display stuff
[01:56] NuckingFuts: mongly.com
[01:56] Tobsn: i work with mongodb as database
[01:56] MrNibbles: mongols
[01:56] Tobsn: no other database anymore
[01:56] Tobsn: and i never used any admin

[01:56] MrNibbles: ACTION is a mongol
[01:57] tuhoojabotti: Nice view!
[01:57] Tobsn: if you figure our how to use the console, its all you need
[01:57] NuckingFuts: But I am quite fond of the "enhanced console" that Mongo-Web-Admin provides
[01:57] tuhoojabotti: Too bad I'm too lazy to shoot it
[01:57] NuckingFuts: Tobsn: I know the console well enough.  It's just nice to have the enhancements it provides.
[01:57] tuhoojabotti: g'night
[01:58] Tobsn: n8
[01:58] MrNibbles: tuhoojabotti: nn

[01:59] mscdex: Calvin: node.js rules
[01:59] Calvin: nodejs and npm on mac than on rules
[01:59] MrNibbles: Tobsn: i often find that, i seem to remember tearing bits out of it at some point
[01:59] Tobsn: yeah
[01:59] Tobsn: i mean just looking at .parse()
[01:59] Tobsn: htats
[02:00] Tobsn: .parse( 't + 5 d' ) => today + 5 days

[02:11] NuckingFuts: We're the new hipster language.
[02:11] Tobsn: why one would use ruby
[02:11] NuckingFuts: So suckit.
[02:11] NuckingFuts: Tobsn: It's the masochists.
[02:11] Determinist: NuckingFuts: javascript < ruby, nodejs is just a runtime.
[02:11] NuckingFuts: Determinist: I disagree, JavaScript forever.
[02:11] NuckingFuts: Ruby is sloooooooooooooooooow.
[02:12] Tobsn: like why would i start using a language that is slow from the start
[02:12] NuckingFuts: ESPECIALLY compared to the V8
[02:12] NuckingFuts: But it's also slower than PHP
[02:12] Determinist: NuckingFuts: compared to a screaming fast runtime like node it is, true.
[02:12] NuckingFuts: Which is pathetic.
[02:12] NuckingFuts: Plus the code is fucking ugly.
[02:12] Determinist: ruyb ain't slower than php
[02:12] NuckingFuts: Determinist: Actually, it is.
[02:12] Tobsn: ruby is a lot slower than php
[02:12] Determinist: unless you're talking about that bloatware rails
[02:12] NuckingFuts: Every benchmark I've seen shows it's slower than PHP
[02:12] NuckingFuts: Ruby 1.9 is slower than PHP 5.x
[02:12] Tobsn: every benchmark i DID shows its slower hehe
[02:13] Determinist: really? most benchmarks i've seen show the opposites
[02:13] Tobsn: those are ruby lovers
[02:13] Determinist: i've seen ruby 1.9 kick python 2.x's ass...
[02:13] Tobsn: who dont know how to use php
[02:13] NuckingFuts: Tobsn: Benchmarking Ruby implies you actually programmed some shit in Ruby.
[02:13] Tobsn: :P
[02:13] Tobsn: nope
[02:13] Tobsn: coworker used to code ruby when we hired him
[02:13] MrNibbles: Determinist: i seem to recall the way they did map was neat
[02:13] NuckingFuts: Determinist: Only if you're an amazing programmer.
[02:13] MrNibbles: there were a few things now
[02:13] Tobsn: took me 6 month to get him to speed
[02:14] MrNibbles: it was how map related to block functions
[02:14] NuckingFuts: Ruby is great... If you're a 13-year-old trying to get into programming.
[02:14] MrNibbles: but i cant quite remember why it was awesome
[02:14] Determinist: lets be honest tho, guys... if you're building a web app and the difference in performance comes down to your choice of language, you're either: 1. a damned good programmer. 2. an idiot.
[02:14] Tobsn: we hired him and his company, they tried to get their ruby code up to speed, didnt work out, we converted it to python and php.
[02:14] NuckingFuts: Determinist: I call #1.
[02:14] Tobsn: and i really tried everything
[02:14] Determinist: the bottleneck is always the DB.
[02:14] NuckingFuts: Tobsn: Ewwwww Python?
[02:14] NuckingFuts: ACTION gags

[02:16] Determinist: regardless, i do like JS and Node, but i find it lacking in a lot of ways.
[02:16] NuckingFuts: Because I have very little open-source shit I've worked on
[02:16] Tobsn: but i dont doubt that changed within the last 3 years
[02:16] NuckingFuts: Determinist: We lack the fluff that slowed down Ruby
[02:16] NuckingFuts: Shit that makes it easier, but is hard to optimize automatically
[02:17] NuckingFuts: I still do recommend Ruby as a language for 13-year-olds who wanna learn programming :P
[02:17] NuckingFuts: Because of the work that _why did to make it really easy to learn.
[02:17] Determinist: NuckingFuts: dude, encapsulation, proper package management, proper inheritance (and not that abomination called prototype based inheritance, which i've learned to get along with, but still hate).

[02:17] Tobsn: *sucks
[02:18] mscdex: hey, you can do some nifty things with it
[02:18] Determinist: logo? do people still remember that?
[02:18] MrNibbles: ACTION doesnt
[02:18] NuckingFuts: Determinist: (1) encapsulation?  Explain. (2) NPM, beat that.(3) prototype-based inheritance isn't *that* bad.  Hell, I've never had to bother much with inheritance, and when I HAVE, it's never caused me trouble.
[02:18] Tobsn: at the university we learned java and (yes) erlang
[02:18] Determinist: i was like... 10 the last time i've played with logo
[02:18] Tobsn: thats 7 years ago
[02:18] mscdex: i had a math game that played music and got an A+ after the teacher heard the music play
[02:18] mscdex: :P
[02:18] NuckingFuts: Tobsn: I'm 100% self-educated
[02:18] Tobsn: and suddenly people started using erlang... i was like wtf?
[02:19] Determinist: NuckingFuts: package management != npm, i'm talking about package management in the Java package sense, not in the rubygems sense.
[02:19] NuckingFuts: Determinist: Java package?
[02:19] NuckingFuts: lolwat?
[02:19] Determinist: nm
[02:19] Determinist: noob
[02:19] Determinist: :P
[02:19] Tobsn: i bet in 6 years someone wraps fortran with a new engine
[02:19] mscdex: fortran.net
[02:19] NuckingFuts: Determinist: Hold on, do you mean like the way you can zip up a Java app into a jar?
[02:20] NuckingFuts: Because NPM can be used to autoinstall dependencies for Node applications.
[02:20] NuckingFuts: It's not just for modules.
[02:20] Determinist: NuckingFuts: no, i mean in the way you can prevent collisions, break your imports up and serve your code in a modular, platform agonistic way
[02:20] NuckingFuts: Trust me, everyone here has been pounding that into my brain consistently for weeks. :S
[02:20] Tobsn: java is nice, esp for webapps with JSP but ONLY IF you run it on a risc CPU solaris SUN machine

[02:20] mscdex: Calvin: java is not nice
[02:20] Calvin: java servers
[02:20] mscdex: heh
[02:21] Determinist: Tobsn: dude, java's more than nice. it's a pain to write stuff in sometimes and so i use high level stuff like node, but it's definitely a lot faster in most cases.
[02:21] Tobsn: buddy of mine started coding java
[02:21] Tobsn: out of nowhere
[02:21] Tobsn: 4 month ago
[02:21] Tobsn: to make android apps
[02:21] Determinist: yeah
[02:22] NuckingFuts: Determinist: Prevent collisions?  Include your dependencies.  platform-agnostic?  They're working on a MinGW build.  Until then, they've got Cygwin for windows.  Native on *nix.
[02:22] Determinist: gotta love it how everybody and their sister keep rushing to the current money-making platforms.
[02:22] Tobsn: he is now down to the GPU process stuff... built an app like instagram that calculates the filters in real time 100 times per second over the GPU
[02:22] Tobsn: that stuff is really impressive
[02:22] Determinist: a month ago it was objc on iOS, 2 years ago it was C# and .net, now it's java and dalvik on android.
[02:22] Tobsn: yeah
[02:22] NuckingFuts: lol @ "a month ago"
[02:22] Tobsn: i juse use titanium :P
[02:22] Tobsn: cause im lazy
[02:22] NuckingFuts: titanium?

[02:22] Determinist: Tobsn: www.particlecode.com
[02:23] Tobsn: actionscript + java?
[02:23] Tobsn: lol
[02:23] Tobsn: thats like vbasic + erlang
[02:23] Tobsn: wtf?
[02:23] NuckingFuts: I just do shit like JS and PHP, because I'm too lazy to deal with low-level bullshit.
[02:23] NuckingFuts: Tobsn: AS3 + Java = vomit
[02:23] Determinist: Tobsn: it's not aimed for you guys
[02:23] Tobsn: nah def. not
[02:23] Tobsn: why would you mix as with java?!
[02:24] Determinist: i'm not?
[02:24] Tobsn: i mean in general
[02:24] Tobsn: why would someone use as mixed with java
[02:24] Determinist: again, i'm not
[02:24] Tobsn: only nice projects i saw was titanium and corona
[02:24] Determinist: as3 is one source language, java's another and C# is yet another
[02:24] Tobsn: for making cross platform mobile apps
[02:24] NuckingFuts: Tobsn: Who the fuck said "HEY LETS SHOVE THE TWO UGLIEST LANGUAGES ON THE WEB TOGETHER"
[02:24] Tobsn: well java is actually very pretty
[02:24] Determinist: NuckingFuts: that would be me
[02:25] Tobsn: because it defines a lot very specific
[02:25] Tobsn: its just a pain in the ass to code it
[02:25] Intel_iX: What's the most up-to-date node compress module for gzip atm?
[02:25] Determinist: Tobsn: +1
[02:25] Tobsn: like i know how to code in it but i dont because its just soooo much pain
[02:25] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[02:25] Determinist: Tobsn: it has the performance, mature VM and with the upcoming JDKs even some dynamic features, but the strong statically typed nature of it makes it a pain
[02:25] Tobsn: compare an app that does the same coded in lets say php to java... java will be 20 times more code
[02:26] Tobsn: yeah, its really a pain, takes so much time, you cant make mistakes etc.
[02:26] Tobsn: i saw it with my buddy
[02:26] Determinist: Tobsn: ever had a nested type for declaring a variable that took 80 characters? :D
[02:26] Tobsn: he has to handle memory, the raw memory, its nuts
[02:26] Tobsn: hehe
[02:26] NuckingFuts: Java is an ugly beast
[02:27] Tobsn: im already doing some high level stuff php with reflections and abstracts and shit for the most simple shit... but java... holy crap.
[02:27] Determinist: HashMap<String, HashMap<String, HashMap<String, Object>>> foo = new HashMap<String, HashMap<String, HashMap<String, Object>>>(); :D
[02:27] NuckingFuts: It's like a pregnant woman times 10 :S
[02:27] caiges has joined the channel
[02:27] NuckingFuts: Only thing worse than it is Obj-C. and that's more because of the fucking Syntax
[02:27] Tobsn: hehe you really never actually used them nuckingfuts
[02:27] Tobsn: obj-c is actually pretty damn nice
[02:28] Tobsn: esp for mac with xcode
[02:28] Determinist: Tobsn: dude, php needs to die. it's a fucking abomination and it's good at nothing in particular. it has a very moderate learning curve and it pretty much copies everything around it, but it's just fucking disgusting at this point.
[02:28] Tobsn: its like java but with less pain
[02:28] NuckingFuts: Tobsn: I've read through plenty of Obj-C
[02:28] NuckingFuts: But it's hideous.
[02:28] Determinist: Tobsn: C++ > ObjC
[02:28] NuckingFuts: The square-bracket shit is horrifying.
[02:28] Determinist: yeah, i agree
[02:28] Tobsn: yeah of course cpp is above all, but obj-c is not partically bad
[02:28] NuckingFuts: And I hear the array functions are a pain
[02:28] NuckingFuts: Tobsn: Oh, it sounds great
[02:28] Determinist: the frameworks are lovely, but the language itself, ughh
[02:28] NuckingFuts: But I can't stand the syntax
[02:28] Tobsn: hehe
[02:29] NuckingFuts: It gives me headaches
[02:29] NuckingFuts: brb laundering
[02:29] AvianFlu: x86 ASM OR GTFO
[02:29] Determinist: :D
[02:29] Determinist: C FTW
[02:29] Tobsn: btw. same buddy who got into java looked at scala and said its nice, so i looked into it and scala is actually worth a try
[02:29] Determinist: Tobsn: fugly.
[02:29] Tobsn: first ever language i learned was basic, second was TCL
[02:30] Tobsn: i coded a couple irc bot plugins in tcl
[02:30] Tobsn: was fun.
[02:30] Determinist: Tobsn: eggbot
[02:30] Tobsn: yep
[02:30] Determinist: those were the days
[02:30] Tobsn: hehe
[02:30] Determinist: eggdrop?
[02:30] Determinist: wtf
[02:30] Tobsn: i coded the first version of the #uptime channel bot for ircnet
[02:30] Determinist: i can't remember the name
[02:30] Tobsn: yeah something like that
[02:30] Tobsn: that was in 1998 or so
[02:30] Determinist: yeah
[02:31] Determinist: sounds about right
[02:31] Tobsn: a year later everyone just used psybnc
[02:31] Tobsn: funny side story, i know psychoid
[02:31] Determinist: before everybody and their sister started doing disgusting shit like MySpace and Facebook
[02:31] Determinist: IRC was/is pure
[02:31] Tobsn: and my old nickname is actually in the stacheldraht code
[02:31] Tobsn: oh yeah, long before
[02:31] Tobsn: and than came quakenet and it got mainstream
[02:31] Determinist: oi
[02:32] Tobsn: i still dont know why
[02:32] Tobsn: but i think they put a irc client into that one app
[02:32] Tobsn: erm
[02:32] Determinist: dude, do you remember the dalnet days and mIRC scripting? seems like everybody i knew was into that shit back then

[02:32] Determinist: ACTION goes misty eyed
[02:32] Tobsn: hehe
[02:32] Tobsn: so lame.
[02:33] Determinist: i fucking hate the web these days
[02:33] Tobsn: i was op in the biggest warez channel on ircnet, man das was funny
[02:33] Determinist: social networking, social gaming, social-yo-mamma
[02:33] Tobsn: yeah
[02:33] Determinist: and a couple of years ago it was all about widgets
[02:34] Determinist: and fuck knows what lame ass crap we'll have in a couple of years
[02:34] Tobsn: back in the day we hung out in #ircfreaks with all the network ops and some of the linux freaks who now control the web hehe.
[02:34] Determinist: hehe
[02:34] Determinist: yeah
[02:34] Tobsn: its really crazy were they all went
[02:34] Determinist: and then the greedy lamers came in and made the web what it is today.
[02:34] Tobsn: oh it sure will get worse
[02:35] Determinist: yeah, i wonder what's next after everybody gets tired growing cows and poking each other on facebook.
[02:35] Determinist: did you ever catch that movie "The Social Network"?

[02:36] Tobsn: zuckerberg is actually a nice guy, but the whole hype is retarded
[02:36] Tobsn: when that started and everyone went apeshit somewhen in 2009 i just told them "remember myspace?"
[02:36] Tobsn: hehe

[02:36] AvianFlu: any time a company is valued at 48 times its annual revenue, somebody somewhere got overenthusiastic
[02:36] Tobsn: oh yeah, that too
[02:37] Tobsn: that shit is nuts
[02:37] Determinist: dude, bill gates is also a nice guy and he made technology go into the "midevil" times thoughout the late 90s and early 2000's. nice means nothing.
[02:37] Tobsn: look at facebook
[02:37] Tobsn: they make 100-200 million in profit the last 3 years
[02:37] Tobsn: and are valued at like 50 billion
[02:37] Tobsn: how is that even possible?
[02:37] AvianFlu: that's what I'm saying Tobsn
[02:37] AvianFlu: it's the data they hold
[02:37] Determinist: i guess.
[02:37] Tobsn: like how in the world is facebook worth more than groupon
[02:37] Determinist: that's worth billions
[02:37] Tobsn: those fuckers make the same money every other month
[02:38] Determinist: they know my dead grandmas underwear size at this point...
[02:38] AvianFlu: we should start a facebook fake data campaign
[02:38] AvianFlu: like, everybody say they're from timbuktu

[02:38] JakeyChan: how to get OS version and type ? 
[02:38] JakeyChan: with node.js
[02:39] Tobsn: the crazy thing about FB is that everyone is using it... my mom stalks me on FB
[02:39] Tobsn: i mean... wtf.
[02:39] Tobsn: she posts pictures daily on fb
[02:39] Determinist: woah, can you imagine what kind of stock price hikes the midget porn industry would see if Wall Street got a hold of that data? :D
[02:39] Tobsn: and talks to her coworkers from her hospital
[02:39] Tobsn: like i post "man this day sucks..." and 10 minutes later my mom calls me
[02:39] Tobsn: shits not funny anymore.
[02:39] Determinist: Tobsn: it made the web accessible to noobs. it's not hard to understand.
[02:40] Tobsn: yeah but myspace did that too
[02:40] Tobsn: and you didnt see your mom on myspace
[02:40] Tobsn: esp what i dont like is the name of the site
[02:40] AvianFlu: myspace had a lot more in the way of whores and xss
[02:40] Tobsn: its "facebook"...
[02:40] Determinist: Tobsn: yeah, but there's a bigger chance of you ending up watching some guy's balls on myspace than on FB
[02:40] Tobsn: yeah but who started that?
[02:41] maushu has joined the channel
[02:41] Tobsn: like im still in the mode of "its the internet get used to it"
[02:41] AvianFlu: totally that guy Tom
[02:41] Determinist: Tobsn: some dude who figured his balls look pretty?
[02:41] Tobsn: i had people ban me on facebook for making sarcastic comments - you know why? "cause my mom reads my feed"
[02:41] Tobsn: wtf
[02:41] Determinist: yeah, it happens.
[02:41] Tobsn: Determinist, nah i mean who started this facebook is clean attitude
[02:41] Determinist: when mom went into the picture, everything had to get a lot cleaner
[02:42] Tobsn: oh and what i hate the most, all those midaged american wifes posting bible quotes on FB
[02:42] Tobsn: wtf?
[02:42] Tobsn: i started replying quotes from the koran a couple month ago
[02:42] coleGillespie has joined the channel
[02:42] AvianFlu: Tobsn: many of those are actually bots
[02:42] Determinist: i mean, moms are like self-regulating entities. you wouldn't behave like a jerk in front of yours, and suddently everybody's moms are online
[02:42] Tobsn: half of them unfriended me after they found out its the koran, the other half still thinks im quoting the bible too because tehy dont know the difference

[02:43] AvianFlu: Tobsn: I'm sorry
[02:43] Tobsn: hehe
[02:43] Tobsn: the best is if i post something about coding and my mom replys on my status with "?" - thats all - just "?"
[02:43] Determinist: anyways, the point is, since FB is "iPadizing" the web for people and Facebook is like the #1 homepage out there, most people will view the web through FB's prism. this is why google is scared shitless at this point and why FB's valuation has nothing to do with their revenue.
[02:44] cindy: hello room!
[02:44] Tobsn: yeah true
[02:44] Determinist: cindy: howdy
[02:44] AvianFlu: like I said, fake data campaign
[02:44] Tobsn: hehe
[02:44] cindy: hi determinist! hru!
[02:44] AvianFlu: gotta kick 'em in the shins while we can still reach their shins
[02:44] Determinist: and i repeat, midget porn ftw.
[02:44] Tobsn: oh i loved to read that FBs numbers are going down now
[02:45] Tobsn: you guys saw that? market is saturated, they lose users in the hundred thousands a day
[02:45] Determinist: AvianFlu: dude, their shins are padded with dollar bills
[02:45] NuckingFuts: Tobsn: Actually
[02:45] NuckingFuts: That data was later found false
[02:45] Tobsn: really?
[02:45] NuckingFuts: That data excluded their mobile hits
[02:45] NuckingFuts: Since ads don't show up there
[02:45] isaacs has joined the channel
[02:45] Tobsn: oh they made that up from ads?
[02:45] NuckingFuts: And their mobile use is up quite a lot
[02:46] Determinist: regardless, they will start losing users at some point. it's inevitable unless humans find a new intelligent civilization on mars
[02:46] Tobsn: i thought thats from FB itself
[02:46] NuckingFuts: Tobsn: The info was released by FB
[02:46] Tobsn: i see
[02:46] NuckingFuts: FOR ADVERTISZER
[02:46] NuckingFuts: That's the catch
[02:46] Tobsn: ah
[02:46] Tobsn: damnit
[02:46] NuckingFuts: They didn't intend for it to end up public
[02:46] Tobsn: i dont want them to hit 1 billion users
[02:46] Tobsn: that would be just disgusting
[02:46] Determinist: no shit
[02:46] Determinist: it'll happen tho
[02:46] Tobsn: you think?
[02:46] Determinist: yeah
[02:46] Tobsn: how much is the pop on earth right now?
[02:47] Determinist: 7+?
[02:47] Tobsn: 7. something billion?
[02:47] Tobsn: yeah i guess
[02:47] NuckingFuts: Tobsn: Apparently they still have somewhere around 70% of the US population visiting EVERY DAY
[02:47] Tobsn: thats crazy
[02:47] Determinist: it is
[02:47] NuckingFuts: And their mobile usage is up 30% or so from last month
[02:47] Determinist: and that leads to that crazy valuation, again.
[02:47] NuckingFuts: That's normal for their sumers though
[02:47] Tobsn: well, im happy i go into that market again
[02:47] NuckingFuts: When summer hits, all the students are out and on their smartphones
[02:47] Tobsn: i started doing facebook apps late 2008
[02:47] Tobsn: and we had an overnight hit
[02:48] Tobsn: 40 million installs within 3 month
[02:48] Determinist: if google has crazy control over search, FB has crazy control over EVERYTHING for every mom and pops out there
[02:48] NuckingFuts: Tobsn: Do you do Android apps?
[02:48] Tobsn: after that hte app died out pretty quickly but we managed to make 20k+ a day in profit for a couple month
[02:48] Tobsn: NuckingFuts, nah
[02:48] NuckingFuts: Damn
[02:48] Determinist: Tobsn: what app was that?
[02:48] NuckingFuts: Because I'm doing a site which is gonna need an Android app later one :P
[02:48] Tobsn: you ever saw socialbots? like marriagebot, friendbot, etc.
[02:48] Determinist: Tobsn: and yeah, that was easy during the wild wild west days of the platform
[02:48] NuckingFuts: We've got an iPhone app developers.
[02:49] Tobsn: yeah we actually owned the company that ran all the social banner ads
[02:49] Tobsn: generating 80 million in profit within 9 month
[02:49] NuckingFuts: Tobsn: Damn
[02:49] Determinist: Tobsn: and then the Zyngas and Play* companies took over
[02:49] NuckingFuts: lolZynga
[02:49] Tobsn: than facebook shut them down because their CEO was an idiot telling the head of facebook to go fuck himself
[02:49] Tobsn: exactly
[02:49] Tobsn: right after zynga got HUGE
[02:49] Determinist: the fact that Zynga exists annoys me all by itself.
[02:50] NuckingFuts: Tobsn: Mike Zuckerberg is a pretty huge prick :/
[02:50] Tobsn: mark ;)
[02:50] NuckingFuts: Whatever
[02:50] Tobsn: hehe
[02:50] Tobsn: sugarhill
[02:50] Tobsn: yeah hes kinda a prick but nice to talk to
[02:50] NuckingFuts: Tobsn: Still a prick either way :P
[02:50] Determinist: who fucking cares about mark zuckerberg tho? he's just a geek who knows PHP, fucking hooray
[02:50] Tobsn: hehe
[02:50] NuckingFuts: Determinist: And he knows how to wget :P
[02:50] Tobsn: well he got it started... i just dont like how they present him, as this genius
[02:51] Determinist: i hate it how every successful fucker who ends up with an idea that hits off suddenly becomes a "genius"
[02:51] Tobsn: he just put something on the web people actually liked because they wanted to do "something cool"
[02:51] NuckingFuts: I did like The Social Network, it was a cool movie.  Just not all that accurate.
[02:51] Tobsn: its not like he had this masterplan of making something crazy addictiv
[02:51] Tobsn: that just happened
[02:51] Determinist: yeah
[02:51] Determinist: could have gone the other way
[02:51] Determinist: and nobody would have heard about him
[02:51] Tobsn: exactly
[02:51] Tobsn: look at all the other stuff
[02:51] NuckingFuts: If anyone was a genius, it was the fucker who wrote the algorithm on the window :P
[02:51] Determinist: but nooo, he's a "genius"
[02:52] Tobsn: yeah
[02:52] Determinist: dude, algorithm my ass
[02:52] NuckingFuts: And Facebook has a horrible backend.
[02:52] NuckingFuts: The frontend is fucking AMAZING.
[02:52] Determinist: they use PHP for the love of god
[02:52] Tobsn: like larry page and the other guy, those fuckers are actually smart
[02:52] NuckingFuts: Their frontend devs are INCREDIBLE.
[02:52] Tobsn: they are hardcore nerds but they are actually smart fuckes
[02:52] Determinist: actually, their JS code is kinda ugly
[02:52] NuckingFuts: But the backend developers?  They're hideous/
[02:52] Tobsn: hehe
[02:52] NuckingFuts: Determinist: beauty isn't everything
[02:53] Determinist: beauty is everything
[02:53] Determinist: elegance is everything
[02:53] NuckingFuts: Not at all
[02:53] Determinist: money is nothing
[02:53] Tobsn: i think all guys in specific positions are actually smart as shit
[02:53] Determinist: we're not fucking cows
[02:53] NuckingFuts: Elegance doesn't mean shit.
[02:53] Tobsn: try to handle a couple million requests a second and stay sane ;)
[02:53] NuckingFuts: I mean, it means very little
[02:53] Determinist: and we don't have 1 litre of brain matter to be doing social networks
[02:53] Tobsn: when we had that social ad company, their office was close to the first big datacenter of facebook
[02:53] Tobsn: they said they have 2 guys for the databases
[02:53] Tobsn: for all database servers
[02:54] Tobsn: they were switching nightshifts every day
[02:54] NuckingFuts: I'm hoping to code a social network in 2 months :P
[02:54] Tobsn: oh and they told me, every day at 4pm PT they shut down all their memcache servers at the same time
[02:54] Tobsn: 500 at a time or so
[02:54] Tobsn: and rebooted them
[02:54] Tobsn: 10000 servers or something
[02:54] Tobsn: he said you could feel it in the air and see lights flickering
[02:55] Tobsn: hehe
[02:55] NuckingFuts: Tobsn: Holy fuck.
[02:55] NuckingFuts: Why would they do that?
[02:55] Tobsn: that was their way of garbage collection
[02:55] Determinist: NuckingFuts: functionality is nice, but that's a given. what makes things tick in the long term and what drives to progress is elegance. e=mc^2 is elegant. it takes a genius to phrase something that complicated in a simple and elegant way, but that's true genius and we're not exactly bumping into people like that on the street every day.
[02:55] NuckingFuts: If you're gonna restart daily, at least do it in phases :S
[02:55] NuckingFuts: I'm no server admin but I know that much.
[02:55] Tobsn: yeah they did
[02:55] Tobsn: 500 servers at a time
[02:55] NuckingFuts: Tobsn: Step it out like 100 servers at a time every 30 minutes or so :/
[02:56] Tobsn: why?
[02:56] NuckingFuts: I'd set up cronjobs for it too
[02:56] Tobsn: no need to
[02:56] Tobsn: lol cronjobs?
[02:56] Tobsn: with 10k+ servers?
[02:56] NuckingFuts: Tobsn: Don't take out yur entire network at once.
[02:56] NuckingFuts: Duh?
[02:56] Determinist: heh
[02:56] Determinist: fucking idiots.
[02:56] Tobsn: you just plug a switch hehe
[02:56] NuckingFuts: That's a horrible idea, you NEVER kill any significant part of your network simultaneously.
[02:56] Determinist: and those 2 guys are like... millionaires now, right? :D
[02:56] Tobsn: pretty sure
[02:57] Determinist: the DB guys, that is
[02:57] Tobsn: yeah
[02:57] NuckingFuts: Dear god I would NEVER let Facebook do cloud hosting for me :V
[02:57] Determinist: i feel like killing something pretty now
[02:57] NuckingFuts: Google?  Fucking yes.
[02:57] NuckingFuts: Amazing?  MAYBE.
[02:57] NuckingFuts: *MAYBE*
[02:57] Determinist: amazon?
[02:57] NuckingFuts: Yeah, Amazon
[02:57] Tobsn: oh hehe btw. at the same time google did their IPO
[02:57] Tobsn: a bit earlier
[02:57] Tobsn: we heard crazy shit about that
[02:57] NuckingFuts: I would totally use Google Cloud.
[02:58] Tobsn: like everyone working there at the moment who wasnt in support or something went from good salary to at least 10 million in real stocks
[02:58] Determinist: oh, this whole cloud computing shit is just one big scam. another crap idea by martketing and business people.
[02:58] NuckingFuts: If there's one network that will remain online for 10 years after the apocalypse, it's Google's.
[02:58] Determinist: this is true
[02:59] Determinist: it's like fucking skynet
[02:59] NuckingFuts: Determinist: The ability to elastically scale applications is the biggest draw for me.
[02:59] Tobsn: people who worked around their google plex told me that people just didnt came to work or just didnt do anything at all... one of my friends actually talked to one of their support people and he said that they just do nothing now... took them like 6-7 month to "restart" the company hehe
[02:59] Tobsn: i bet the same will happen to FB if they ever go public
[02:59] Determinist: and on a humorous note, it would probably be google's network who would initiate the apocalypse :D

[03:00] Tobsn: like the guy who invested adsense and adwords, i think he got 500 million out of that and left already 2 years ago

[03:08] kbni: Cluster detected over 20 worker deaths in the first
[03:08] kbni: 20 seconds of life, there is most likely
[03:08] Tobsn: displaying specific symbols is "illegal"
[03:08] kbni: a serious issue with your server.
[03:08] kbni: Don't judge me, bro!
[03:08] Tobsn: and racism is as illegal as here
[03:08] NuckingFuts: Tobsn: I've always heard that the Nazi Party was banned from elections
[03:09] Tobsn: oh of course
[03:09] Tobsn: its an illegal party
[03:09] NuckingFuts: And the swastika is banned too, right?

[03:11] tmpvar: socket.io and cluster have a few issues working together ;)
[03:11] Tobsn: a few ;)
[03:12] Tobsn: you still havent fixed it?
[03:12] Tobsn: wtf
[03:12] Tobsn: ;)
[03:12] tmzt: socket.io is in general too random
[03:12] kbni: tmpvar: cluster is yours?
[03:12] tmzt: I'm thinking of just doing websockets
[03:12] tmpvar: kbni, nah
[03:12] tmzt: SubStack: what variable passed to a middleware function in dnode is persistent?
[03:13] Tobsn: tmzt, there are some workarounds

[03:13] Tobsn: reloaded?
[03:14] tmzt: so I tried exporting the dnode object and calling listen outside
[03:14] tmzt: I mean each worker runs the whole .js file

[03:43] Benny_: ah
[03:45] Benny_: I'm thinking to use Redis with this.  Feels right, since you can store JSON in Redis
[03:46] al3xnull: Benny_: Just a note, you can store JSON in about anything as long as you are able to serialize it.
[03:49] JakeyChan: can you write regex express for me ? xxxx xxx  :  xxxxx \n xxxx : xxxxx \n , I want to get the xxxx that on the left of ':' and xxx that on the right of ':' but end of \n

[03:57] al3xnull: Is anyone familiar with Faye or Juggernaut?
[04:01] tmzt: used Faye a while ago
[04:01] tmzt: what are you trying to do?

[04:02] smtlaissezfaire has joined the channel
[04:03] al3xnull: To be honest, I rather understand the concepts, but looking through what is out there, I end up with just questions it seems.
[04:03] al3xnull: Is Faye simply doing long-polling or does it make use of web sockets where possible now?
[04:03] tmzt: if you want all that use socket.io or dnode
[04:03] Benny_: ya
[04:03] tmzt: faye is pretty basic but it works
[04:04] al3xnull: Socket.io doesn't handle pub/sub by nature though does it? It's simply a transport abstraction right?
[04:04] SubStack: tmzt: I haven't actually used dnode middlewares as much as I should

[04:07] tmzt: I'm looking at the backbone example
[04:09] al3xnull: t|f: Not going to lie, hook.io looks rather vague without concise documentation / examples. Any place I should be looking in particular. I'm hoping not to role my own pubsub if possible.

[07:30] dominictarr: NuckingFuts: I heard of someone who built some enter-captcha-to-view-porn game, but it was actually real captchas from other sites, and it was signing up bots. 
[07:30] SubStack: tlrobinson: fs.createReadStream() can take a start and end
[07:30] SubStack: might be close enough
[07:30] NuckingFuts: dominictarr: There's always that possibility :P

[07:52] NuckingFuts: cachemoney: But the API powers the site too

[07:52] NuckingFuts: :/
[07:52] cachemoney: you could exchange username/password for an auth token
[07:52] NuckingFuts: Can I just generate an auth token?
[07:52] smtlaissezfaire has joined the channel
[07:53] Skola: were you a good boy and checked out my suggestion on everyauth?
[07:53] cachemoney: you should really read up on oauth
[07:53] NuckingFuts: That's my biggst problem :/
[07:53] NuckingFuts: cachemoney: I have, but it's a complex protocol :V
[07:53] cachemoney: i read oauth spec in a couple hours
[07:53] NuckingFuts: cachemoney: how big is it?
[07:54] NuckingFuts: ACTION is driving to the coast tomorrow. Some big pirate thing, IIRC
[07:54] dall: guys someone use socket.io ?
[07:54] NuckingFuts: Might as well get some reading material for the drive :P
[07:54] Skola: pirates!?
[07:55] cachemoney: NuckingFuts: not too long: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-16
[07:55] NuckingFuts: Skola: EveryAuth solves EveryProblem, except mine.
[07:55] dall: someone could help me? https://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO-node/issues/249

[07:55] McMAGIC--Copy has joined the channel
[07:56] cachemoney: NuckingFuts: you could also read facebook/twitter api docs to get an idea of how they do it
[07:58] NuckingFuts: cachemoney: Isn't the facebook site using a eparate system form the facebook APIs?
[07:58] NuckingFuts: If not, I ought to read their docs
[07:58] cachemoney: NuckingFuts: yes, but not twitter
[07:59] NuckingFuts: cachemoney: Is that why xauth is?
[07:59] cachemoney: NuckingFuts: twitter.com uses their own API
[07:59] NuckingFuts: IS xauth compatible with OAuth 2?
[07:59] csser has joined the channel
[07:59] cachemoney: i'm not exactly sure how they handle auth to the api on twitter.com. might be just normal session id's + csrf tokens
[07:59] msucan has joined the channel
[08:00] cachemoney: not sure if xauth is in the oauth spec, doubt it though
[08:00] NuckingFuts: cachemoney: So they probably have 2 authentication shits?
[08:00] NuckingFuts: It can accept one of either method?
[08:00] NuckingFuts: cachemoney: Either way, I don't want people to h4xx0r my site.
[08:00] NuckingFuts: I want my users to be secure.
[08:01] NuckingFuts: I'm not Mark Zuckerberg.
[08:01] Tobsn: hmm seconds into human readable time
[08:01] Tobsn: x days x hours x minutes etc.
[08:01] Tobsn: it seems like all examples online just devide by days and minutes
[08:01] Tobsn: wouldnt that be wrong?
[08:01] Tobsn: shouldnt they extract downwards?
[08:02] cachemoney: NuckingFuts: twitter.com loads an iframe to api.twitter.com/receiver.html and does all the ajax api requests from there. looks like it uses normal session id's and csrf tokens for POST data
[08:03] dall: ??
[08:03] Tobsn: days = seconds / ( 60 * 60 * 24 ); hours = ( seconds - ( days * 24 * 60 * 60 ) ) / ( 60 * 60 )
[08:03] NuckingFuts: Tobsn: I use modulo in mine
[08:03] Tobsn: yeah but isnt that wrong?
[08:03] Tobsn: dont you have to substract what you already know?
[08:04] NuckingFuts: Tobsn: 26 hours % 24 hours = 2 hours
[08:04] Tobsn: well yes
[08:04] NuckingFuts: floor( 26 hours / 24 hours ) = 1
[08:04] Tobsn: but now you have to substract those two hours
[08:04] Tobsn: form the original timestamp to get the minutes and seconds
[08:05] NuckingFuts: Tobsn: Yeah  prolly could do that lol
[08:05] Tobsn: dont you HAVE to?
[08:05] Tobsn: otherwise you get just the same time in different formats

[08:09] Lorentz: Tobsn: You're trying to convert seconds in readable form?
[08:09] Tobsn: yep
[08:09] Lorentz: If you're dividing right, all you need is the whole number part.
[08:09] CStumph has joined the channel
[08:09] Lorentz: On the same seconds.
[08:10] Tobsn: but dont you have on substracting?
[08:10] Lorentz: Why would you?
[08:10] Tobsn: well because if you got the days you need to take the day seconds out of the whole sum?
[08:10] Lorentz: What's 119 seconds in minutes?
[08:10] cachemoney: dall: what's wrong with socket.io?
[08:11] Tobsn: (sum % 60) minutes and sum - (60 * (sum % 60)) seconds
[08:11] herbySk has joined the channel
[08:12] dominictarr: lorentz: 2 minutes
[08:13] dall: cachemoney, no works :)
[08:13] cachemoney: what's the problem?
[08:13] dall: cachemoney, using one browser i have an infinite loop (chrome) using firefox the messages are not sent...
[08:14] dall: cachemoney, https://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO-node/issues/249
[08:14] Lorentz: Tobsn: Thinking again, you probably do want to subtract after calculating
[08:14] Tobsn: see!
[08:14] cachemoney: ah, 0.7
[08:14] Tobsn: either im going nuts or all those examples online are complete bullshit
[08:14] Lorentz: 119 seconds is 1.98~ minutes, so just figure out how many seconds is in 1 minute, the whole number part of that
[08:14] dall: cachemoney, yes
[08:14] Lorentz: % would work too
[08:15] dall: cachemoney, download 0.7 yesterday night

[08:18] dall: cachemoney, they will release 0.7 this weekend so i think it's ready

[08:31] jakeg: what *should* work? i can't even find that atm
[08:31] jakeg: am on 1.0.10
[08:32] isaacs: jakeg: curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
[08:32] isaacs: jakeg: like a fresh install
[08:32] jakeg: ahh cool, thanks isaacs :) just wanting to try out the new --save you added ;)
[08:33] isaacs: jakeg: it's not released yet
[08:33] isaacs: jakeg: but you can get the source and make install
[08:33] jakeg: shoudl probably update the main readme.md file to explain the correct way to upgrade. really isn't obvious atm
[08:33] jakeg: k
[08:33] isaacs: jakeg: mostly, just been too busy to run tests and review docs
[08:33] isaacs: jakeg: well, post about 1.0.11, npm update -g *should* work fine
[08:33] jakeg: thought about having --save work even if there isn't an existing package.json file or not?
[08:34] isaacs: jakeg: yeah.. it'll fail if there isn't one.
[08:34] jakeg: ahh right
[08:34] isaacs: jakeg: maybe it should print a message about creating one, or doing `npm init`?
[08:34] isaacs: feedback on that is great.  please post issues :)
[08:34] jakeg: that'd be great. anything to save someone manually having to write json would be a benefit
[08:34] isaacs: sure
[08:35] jakeg: would be particularly useful in combination with https://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues/914
[08:35] isaacs: jakeg: yeah, agreed
[08:36] jakeg: cool. thanks for making npm amazing, such a time saver generally :D
[08:36] isaacs: thanks
[08:39] jakeg: woah, hadn't heard of/tried npm init before. that's perfect!
[08:41] isaacs: jakeg: have you tried `npm version 1.2.3`
[08:41] CStumph has joined the channel

[09:21] Tobsn: like 2 hours ago, yesterday, 3 hours ago etc.
[09:21] Skola: the show fancy part
[09:21] Skola: is something you don't want to write yourself

[09:22] Tobsn: its frontend anyway
[09:22] Tobsn: so who cares
[09:22] Tobsn: let it be the clients problem :P
[09:22] Tobsn: im not even sure if that thing always works
[09:22] Tobsn: oh and what confuses me the most i have to / by 10000 to get seconds
[09:22] Tobsn: which i thought is 1000
[09:22] Tobsn: but if i devide by 1000 i get weeks instead of days
[09:23] JakeyChan: I use Ctrl + C to stop node.js but When I restart the script, it tell me address in use .

[09:26] Tobsn: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1656816/Screenshots/rw66.png
[09:26] Tobsn: JakeyChan, killall -9 node
[09:26] saschagehlich: works quite well but I'm confused about facebooks way of directly accessing my app out of facebook
[09:26] saschagehlich: it tries to access / via POST
[09:27] saschagehlich: do you know what I have to do to get it working and to authorize the user?
[09:27] JakeyChan: Tobsn: thanks 
[09:27] Tobsn: har
[09:27] Tobsn: be careful with that
[09:27] Tobsn: that kills all processes with executable "node"
[09:27] Tobsn: and it kills it hard
[09:27] Tobsn: -9 <-
[09:28] Tobsn: saschagehlich, is that even possible?
[09:28] Tobsn: all new apps are iframed
[09:29] saschagehlich: hm dunno what facebook does there but when I try to open up my application via the facebook bookmarks it tells me "Cannot POST /?ref=bookmarks"
[09:29] Tobsn: hmm
[09:29] Tobsn: you sure you configed it right?
[09:30] saschagehlich: mmmh what could have gone wrong?
[09:30] Tobsn: a sec
[09:30] Tobsn: opening my last one
[09:30] Tobsn: bookmark url has to be the whole facebook app path
[09:31] Tobsn: http://apps.facebook.com/yourcanvaspagename/?ref=bookmarks
[09:32] saschagehlich: http://apps.facebook.com/beatquest/?ref=bookmarks

[09:32] asdfsafdsa: what's a good html reader module? i have to do some data mining
[09:33] Tobsn: saschagehlich, facebook doesnt GET your stuff
[09:33] Tobsn: it does POST
[09:33] Tobsn: for each request
[09:33] saschagehlich: well yea sure, but why is it doing a POST request and how does it want me to handle it?
[09:33] Tobsn: in the POST vars you'll find session vars etc.
[09:33] Tobsn: it wants you to handle it like a GET request
[09:33] saschagehlich: can i use those session vars to authenticate the user?
[09:33] saschagehlich: hm okay
[09:33] Tobsn: but in the POST it sends tokens and session data etc.
[09:33] Tobsn: yes
[09:33] Tobsn: thats what they are for
[09:34] Tobsn: but if you use the client side javascript sdk you can just ignore that
[09:34] saschagehlich: will the client side sdk handle that automatically?
[09:34] Tobsn: if you want to handle it server side you need the POST vars they send you for auth
[09:34] Tobsn: should yeah
[09:34] saschagehlich: hmmm
[09:34] saschagehlich: okay I'll try that
[09:34] saschagehlich: thanks!
[09:34] Tobsn: np
[09:35] Tobsn: like if you use the php sdk, the php sdk handles that all for you
[09:35] Tobsn: idk if there is a node.js sdk ;)

[11:59] Tobsn: it like actually sorts them by size
[11:59] xerox: it decides them arbitrarily
[11:59] davidbanham has joined the channel
[12:00] Tobsn: if you look into the source, each image has a width
[12:00] Tobsn: and it sorts them so they fit in columns making up a fully filled line
[12:00] cachemoney has joined the channel
[12:00] xerox: that can't always happen
[12:00] Tobsn: try it
[12:00] xerox: no
[12:00] Tobsn: i think they use also different margins around the images
[12:00] stagas_ has joined the channel
[12:00] Tobsn: to make it always end at a full width
[12:00] xerox: either that or setting the widths
[12:01] Tobsn: idk
[12:01] Tobsn: but its done pretty damn well
[12:01] xerox: maybe they use a text justification algorithm
[12:01] xerox: like the TeX one
[12:01] Tobsn: if you resize the window you see they reload the whole set
[12:01] xerox: where the text boxes are replaced with image boxes
[12:01] Tobsn: i tried to do the same with masonry and its not working at all
[12:01] fairwinds has joined the channel
[12:02] jonasen has joined the channel
[12:03] Tobsn: it definitly sorts them somehow

[12:03] Tobsn: evenly per line
[12:03] Tobsn: but it looks like the images are also in some sort of column
[12:03] Tobsn: problem is you cant really read their js code
[12:03] xerox: not even with the latest chromne
[12:03] Tobsn: its just complete obfuscated into their code
[12:03] xerox: who has got a un-obfuscator built in?=

[12:04] Tobsn: trust me, i did that once

[12:04] Tobsn: they have this sort of framework
[12:04] Tobsn: and their code is mixed into it
[12:04] Tobsn: its a pain in the ass
[12:05] Tobsn: you know whats really interesting?
[12:05] Tobsn: if you click an image
[12:05] Tobsn: it loads the page in the background
[12:05] Tobsn: and overlays somehow a layer of the image in fullsize and the right sidebar

[12:46] liar has joined the channel
[12:46] alessio_alex: what is it then?
[12:46] thejh: alessio_alex: that's the automatic proxy checker of freenode that scans your computer when you connect - it makes sure that you aren't an open proxy
[12:47] thejh: alessio_alex: so it talks to your webserver as if it was a proxy
[12:47] alessio_alex: ah lol
[12:47] kurtsymanzik has left the channel
[12:48] thejh: alessio_alex: well, that explains it - when it's a normal http connection, the querystring looks like "/foo/bar", but when you talk to a proxy, you send a qs like "http://example.com/foo/bar"

[13:50] xerox: you have a 0 padding

[13:57] bingomanatee: If you are NOT in such a folder it will put your module into your user's (global) folder.
[13:57] xerox: not quite
[13:58] xerox: it will always put it in ./node_modules unless you specify -g
[13:58] mynyml has joined the channel
[13:59] xerox: with -g (global) it will use process.installPrefix to figure out what global means to you
[14:02] anno^da: xerox: I know that the missing user agent is causing the API not to respond. Is there a way of setting the user agent for http(s).get / http(s).request calls ? I can't find a possibility in the docs for node.js 0.4.8
[14:03] xerox: anno^da: that seems utterly strange
[14:03] xerox: it has an options object
[14:03] xerox: as first parameter!
[14:04] anno^da: yeah I know that but the options mentioned in the docs do not include the user-agent

[15:08] al3xnull_: Our business started Facebook apps for companies not long ago. Although they are on Node, it's still not using Node for anything interesting. Namely that we didn't want to setup another architecture.
[15:09] seawise: I'm using node.js + mongodb stack in my playground stuff, I think node.js projects can be very nice to high-traffic Facebook apps, adding real-time experience and fun to the process
[15:09] al3xnull_: We still support legacy ColdFusion applications though. Those are the worse things I have to work on. 
[15:10] al3xnull_: seawise: Agree completely =]

[15:43] al3xnull_: Benny_: Socket.io probably make it easy, but I imagine it could be done with a number of messaging schemes.
[15:43] slickplaid: Do TCP sockets in node.js have any sort of timeout? Or is it connect and it'll stay connected for as long as possible?
[15:43] Benny_: Yeah, I mean its probably better to just make dedicated socket servers in C/C++
[15:43] Benny_: oh thats another option, just making the users connect by TCP
[15:44] Max-Might has joined the channel
[15:46] al3xnull_: slickplaid: I'm not entirely sure. Would have to read the docs closer.
[15:46] al3xnull_: slickplaid: I want to say that there is most likely a default timeout value which can be changed.

[15:49] Benny_: I'm looking at the TCP/IP now and I don't see broadcasting... looking...
[15:49] seawise: what is the benefits of using Faye/Juggernaught for messaging? my messages run simple using just Socket.io
[15:50] alessio_alex: well I believe you can use multiple channels with Faye
[15:50] alessio_alex: and you don't have to create multiple socket servers
[15:50] alessio_alex: though it's been a while since I've used Faye
[15:50] al3xnull_: seawise: Aye. Channels.
[15:51] seawise: can you explain in detail?
[15:51] alessio_alex: so for example you can make 2 channels
[15:51] alessio_alex: 1: "/clients/chat"
[15:51] alessio_alex: 2: "/clients/support"
[15:52] tmpvar has joined the channel
[15:52] alessio_alex: and you can send/receive messages for these 2 channels
[15:52] alessio_alex: without having to create 2 servers
[15:52] alessio_alex: one for each channel
[15:52] alessio_alex: (as far as I remember)
[15:52] al3xnull_: Correct.
[15:52] alessio_alex: And I can tell you that Faye is really used and actively developed
[15:53] alessio_alex: I'm subscribed to their google group
[15:53] al3xnull_: Allows you to separate communication between clients, perform authentication, and avoid many open sockets & related servers.
[15:53] alessio_alex: yup
[15:53] alessio_alex: If you encounter problems, you can make a post on the group, J.Couglan (the dev) is really active
[15:54] al3xnull_: alessio_alex: Question for you then because I'm trying to decide -- Is Faye using websockets or is it still just using polling (I think I read that on their docs)
[15:54] alessio_alex: al3xnull_ both Faye and Socket.io use different stuff, depending on the browser
[15:54] alessio_alex: on Chrome they'll use WebSockets
[15:54] al3xnull_: Aye, just that the options exists.
[15:54] al3xnull_: Okay
[15:54] alessio_alex: on Firefox 3.something they'll use Flash for ex
[15:54] slickplaid: Faye is pretty neat, I've gotta admit. Played with it for a while on a previous project but decided to go with dnode and something simpler (didn't really need pubsub for it)
[15:55] slloyd has joined the channel
[15:55] al3xnull_: alessio_alex: Thanks. I wondered about that. Doesn't mention sockets in the docs (might have missed it), but figured it was rather feature parity to Juggernaut.
[15:56] alessio_alex: Erm, it's surely mentioned in the docs.
[15:56] alessio_alex: Let me check
[15:56] al3xnull_: slickplaid: To be honest, I wish I could just use Socket.io for this. My diagrams are rather involved between the client & server =P
[15:56] al3xnull_: (With the need for different channels as pub/sub)
[15:56] thejh: I recently switched to another linux installation on my PC, and to regain publish access to npm, I tried to copy ~/.npmrc to my new installation, but npm doesn't publish anyway. Is _authCrypt system-specific?
[15:57] thejh: the error message is: "Error: Cannot insert data into the registry without authorization"
[15:58] alessio_alex: al3xnull_ I cannot find that in the docs, but I have seen a post about all comunication methods in the group, so 100% it uses websockets, flash websockets, long pooling etc... depending on the browser
[15:58] automatist has joined the channel
[15:59] al3xnull_: alessio_alex: Okay. =] Sweet. Believe you ;)

[15:59] al3xnull_: slickplaid: Sproutcore backend to provide realtime updates for the client
[15:59] alessio_alex: cool
[16:00] automatist has left the channel
[16:00] al3xnull_: Although I spoke to #sproutcore guys and Thoth is actively developed for it, for now, I need to be able to get something up and running. Thoth makes my head hurt too much for a side project.

[16:36] tbranyen: make something new
[16:36] Swizec: yeah, but what
[16:36] Swizec: everything I come up with already exists :D
[16:36] tbranyen: do better then
[16:36] AvianFlu: there's no Tor wrapper last I checked
[16:36] tbranyen: AvianFlu: interesting idea
[16:36] AvianFlu: I've put a little thought into doing that one myself, but I'm busy and not completely aware what's involved
[16:37] tbranyen: Creating a tor exit node with Node would be amazing
[16:37] AvianFlu: bridges, too
[16:37] tbranyen: yea
[16:37] AvianFlu: make a lightweight bridge that could be run on any crap hardware
[16:37] Swizec: bridge?
[16:38] slloyd has joined the channel
[16:38] AvianFlu: a bridge is a small, non-advertised tor entry point
[16:38] AvianFlu: the idea being that somebody like the chinese gov't will block the public relay list, so smaller 'secret' relays are needed 
[16:38] AvianFlu: to help people get around stuff like that
[16:38] tbranyen: oh hahaha thats awesome
[16:39] tbranyen: i figured a bridge was a middle point in the tor network
[16:39] AvianFlu: no, it's a term they use for the non-advertised server thing
[16:39] AvianFlu: it's like, "Want to help?  Please run a bridge or relay."
[16:39] tbranyen: How would a bridge help anyone but yourself?
[16:39] Swizec: hmm, pretty certain I don't know anything about tor :)
[16:40] tbranyen: Its non-advertised
[16:40] AvianFlu: it's not completely non-advertised
[16:40] AvianFlu: it's just not on the public entry points list or whatever
[16:40] AvianFlu: there are ways to get the address of someone else's bridge quietly
[16:40] AvianFlu: I don't remember the details, but at one point I was on a US ISP that blocked tor connections, and I found a few bridge IPs
[16:40] tbranyen: hmmm i guess i have no idea how that would be possible
[16:40] devsundar has joined the channel
[16:41] tbranyen: why have any public listed tor entry points if you don't have to?
[16:41] AvianFlu: I think they do have to
[16:41] AvianFlu: cause the main relays are the ones that can handle more traffic
[16:42] AvianFlu: bridges are small and distributed
[16:42] AvianFlu: hard to p2p the whole thing right off the bat
[16:42] AvianFlu: I've assumed that if I got started on this project, I'd have to go find some devs involved in the main Tor project and talk to them about what i'd need to do
[16:42] AvianFlu: but alas, real work
[16:44] al3xnull has joined the channel
[16:45] devsundar has joined the channel
[16:46] Swizec: yeah I don't think I'd be able to pull off tor support
[16:46] Swizec: idea: is there anything like a lazy sequence in node or javascript in general?
[16:46] AvianFlu: yeah that's gonna be a team effort at some point lol
[16:47] Swizec: I meant, I don't even know where to start :)
[16:47] Benny_: If someone's going to add stuff to node.., more fully featured chat servers, or game servers would be very nice :)
[16:48] Benny_: or maybe a way to play a game using only peer to peer messaging within a browser (possible?)
[16:48] Benny_: like a client side nodejs?
[16:48] AvianFlu: Benny_ : I bet you could do that with dnode
[16:48] Swizec: hmm, or p2p websites
[16:48] Benny_: ya a p2p hosted site
[16:49] unomi has joined the channel
[16:49] AvianFlu: problematic, how do you determine who has the real version of the site
[16:49] AvianFlu: in a ring of peers
[16:49] Swizec: how do you determine who has the real version of a movie?
[16:49] Benny_: lol
[16:49] AvianFlu: well that's what I'm saying, if we p2p host a page, what stops me from abusing the p2p and making a fake version full of xss or whatever
[16:49] Swizec: I think the idea would have to be load sharing with your visitors
[16:50] Swizec: where somebody is still in control of the validation hashes of some sort
[16:50] Benny_: first person to change the checksum gets booted/banned lol
[16:50] AvianFlu: makes sense

[16:51] AvianFlu: Swizec, have you looked at http://github.com/Marak/hook.io yet?

[16:56] tbranyen: they aren't doing the same thing
[16:56] ntr0py has joined the channel
[16:56] Swizec: really?
[16:56] Swizec: a brief glance at dnode told me that it does client-side function calling from the server
[16:56] tbranyen: AvianFlu: didn't realize substrack wrote implementations of dnode in perl, ruby, and java
[16:56] tbranyen: thats pretty sick
[16:56] AvianFlu: yeah, substack is the man like that
[16:57] tbranyen: Might bring it up to a client we just got who wants to do some cross language pubsub for the api
[16:57] AvianFlu: Swizec: it's always bidirectional, so you can always method-call in both directions if I'm not mistaken
[16:57] tbranyen: i was thinking of zeromq
[16:57] AvianFlu: it's often referred to as "staring into the mirror" cause it's easy to get confused about which direction you want to be talking in
[16:58] gazumps has joined the channel
[16:58] Benny_: so you can have clients pretending they're servers, effectively?
[16:59] AvianFlu: not pretending they're servers, exposing method calls to servers
[16:59] AvianFlu: and to other clients if you wanted to get fancy
[16:59] AvianFlu: it's basically a trick that lets you put method calls in JSON, instead of having to send JSON to the method call URI like with REST
[17:00] klovadis: the cool thing about dnode is that you have a server on which multiple clients can connect to. by pretending that you can actually call methods on the other side it makes transferring messages really easy

[17:01] klovadis: there are a few tools that do that
[17:02] thejh: Swizec: now.js does more
[17:02] klovadis: if you hang out here you will have heard marak talking about hook.io which sort of does the same
[17:02] thejh: but now.js is also uglier, for example, it scans the whole exported js every few seconds if it's in the browser
[17:03] klovadis: i wouldn't want to use too much of that code in the browser anyway
[17:03] _Sorensen: dnode is the better tool imo
[17:03] klovadis: i'd be very wary of injections
[17:03] Swizec: interesting, I'll have to give dnode a try
[17:03] Swizec: nowjs has seemed somewhat slow at times
[17:03] _Sorensen: ive used both
[17:04] AvianFlu: what I've heard is that dnode is smarter and more efficient
[17:04] _Sorensen: i would agree
[17:04] AvianFlu: but I haven't used nowjs, so it's all hearsay
[17:04] _Sorensen: now.js also seems to be geared towards being a solution
[17:04] _Sorensen: and not just a tool
[17:04] AvianFlu: right
[17:04] Swizec: you think a websocket connection can be established client-to-client?
[17:04] Swizec: or does it have to be client-server?
[17:05] Benny_: thats what im interested in
[17:05] _Sorensen: i've heard there are specs for client-to-client in the works
[17:05] _Sorensen: from the w3
[17:05] Benny_: have someone start a flash game, then use this to create games, host, join, etc.
[17:05] _Sorensen: but as of now, i don't believe its possible
[17:05] Swizec: hmm
[17:06] _Sorensen: no browser supports it
[17:06] Swizec: flash can connect to other flash right?
[17:06] Swizec: without a server in between?
[17:07] _Sorensen: yes, but thats more or less the same thing
[17:07] Benny_: nowjs reminds me of Erlang, correct me if I'm wrong.  you can add new code on the fly to server and client, in realtime.  and it will work
[17:07] _Sorensen: as client-server
[17:08] _Sorensen: benny: the mechanics behind that are extremely different
[17:08] Swizec: oh well
[17:08] Swizec: I think I'll go implement lazy sequences in javascript/node
[17:08] Swizec: does anythign like that exist already?
[17:08] _Sorensen: https://github.com/substack/node-seq
[17:09] Swizec: god damn it
[17:09] Swizec: the node community is just too vibrant and lively
[17:09] _Sorensen: from the maker of dnode :)
[17:09] kylefox has joined the channel
[17:09] Swizec: or I'm being sooper uncreative lately
[17:10] thejh: today, I wrote something that didn't yet exist: https://github.com/thejh/node-assertvanish - assert that an object will be gone and if it isn't after a specified amount of time, print the reason
[17:10] _Sorensen: i dont think you can ever be too vibrant :P
[17:10] Swizec: it's just bumming me out that I've been itching to make a node module all weekend
[17:10] Swizec: and anythign I come up with already exists
[17:10] _Sorensen: https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js doesnt do that?
[17:11] thejh: if I have nothing to do, I invent crazy features for coffeescript, implement them and put them in their issue tracker
[17:11] _Sorensen: i resort to making backbone.js extentions
[17:12] _Sorensen: and apparently failing at getting docco to run
[17:12] Swizec: with my luck everything for that exists already as well
[17:12] _Sorensen: >.<
[17:12] telemachus: thejh: Is that a problem you often run into or just having fun?
[17:12] tmzt: Benny_: is nowjs layered over socketio?
[17:13] thejh: telemachus: not one I often run into, but I already saw people on the mailinglist speculating about where memory leaks could be at least one time
[17:13] Max-Might has left the channel
[17:13] thejh: telemachus: so, more like "just having fun", I think

[17:34] thejh: _Sorensen: minimal installation? Isn't that "npm install -g docco; docco test.coffee"?
[17:35] _Sorensen: after installing mecurial and pygments, then npm installing coffee-script
[17:37] _Sorensen: this is what i get: /usr/bin/env: node: No such file or directory

[18:37] indutny: rpj8: oh
[18:37] indutny: rpj8: callback(--seconds, callback, next); => callback.call(self, --seconds, etc)
[18:37] rpj8: indutny: ftw. link please?
[18:37] indutny: rpj8: you're running callback in a global context
[18:37] rpj8: am I?
[18:38] indutny: rpj8: can you change that line?
[18:38] indutny: rpj8: and try
[18:38] indutny: rpj8: ;)
[18:38] rpj8: indutny: surely. It's a shame; I just read about this stuff 2 days ago
[18:38] rpj8: and the concept is already fuzzy again.
[18:38] indutny: rpj8: or you can do that: client.game.timer(3, client.game.timer, ...) => client.game.timer(3, client.game.timer.bind(client.game), ...)
[18:39] indutny: you're picking client.game.timer method and running it without context
[18:39] indutny: so you should call it with context (via .call() method) or bind it to context before passing it
[18:39] indutny: rpj8: is that clear?
[18:40] rpj8: indutny: I mean, I understand what you mean when you say it's out of context. I'm just confused as to how it loses context in the first place. what line does it lose its context?
[18:40] indutny: rpj8: it should work for first time, but when you'll call `callback` variable it will loose it
[18:41] rpj8: :/
[18:41] indutny: rpj8: still not clear?
[18:41] rpj8: I understand the fix and the concept
[18:41] rpj8: no it's clear.
[18:41] indutny: rpj8: ok :)
[18:41] rpj8: I just don't understand _how_ it loses it
[18:41] rpj8: I don't know

[18:43] S1kx has joined the channel
[18:43] indutny: rpj8: ok, let me explain. when you're calling any method like that: methodName() - it runs in global context, when you run it like that: object.methodName() - it runs in context of object, so this === object inside it. So what are you doing is: var a = obj.b; a();
[18:44] indutny: rpj8: that's why you need to specify context manually, by calling .call() or .bind()

[18:51] RC1140: hey guys sorry to bother , im looking for an example that can explain non blocking in node , can anyone point me to something
[18:52] AvianFlu: RC1140 in what sense?
[18:52] rpj8: indutny: is it because it uses the setTimeout function?
[18:53] rpj8: that it loses context?
[18:53] RC1140: im basically at a loss for words on how to explain it to co workers i.e. why everything is async
[18:53] RC1140: when comparing it to say python or php
[18:53] indutny: RC1140: https://gist.github.com/ed4a54bbedf0572c9c4c
[18:53] rpj8: RC1140: example php blocks because it waits at ever line until it's done. JavaScript fires and forgets
[18:54] rpj8: er, I guess apache blocks
[18:54] rpj8: is what i meant
[18:54] RC1140: sweet thanks for the example indutny 
[18:54] TheFuzzball has joined the channel
[18:54] AvianFlu: RC1140: in a synchronous language, your lines will execute one after another in sequence
[18:54] indutny: rpj8: not really, but when passing function directly as setTimeout argument - yes
[18:54] AvianFlu: in the likes of javascript, it will start each line but not wait for them to finish
[18:54] indutny: rpj8: in your example you're passing object's method as argument to other function
[18:55] RC1140: so in that example the 'done writing' would only fire when the file is finished writing
[18:55] rpj8: indutny: ohhhh oh oh
[18:55] gde33 has joined the channel
[18:55] indutny: rpj8: after that you're calling that argument and expecting that it'll run as you're running it in a context of object
[18:55] indutny: RC1140: yes
[18:55] rpj8: indutny: I gotcha. so it just pases the function() part without any context at all.
[18:55] rpj8: indutny: i think i'm starting to understand
[18:55] indutny: rpj8: yeah
[18:55] indutny: rpj8: you got it
[18:56] rpj8: indutny: woof.
[18:56] rpj8: indutny: is it like that in every language that uses functions as first class objects?
[18:56] indutny: rpj8: I don't really know, but probably answer is yes
[18:57] indutny: ah, sorry - I meant no :D
[18:57] indutny: b/c languages are often passing context along with a function
[18:57] indutny: so you can't really detach method from object

[19:07] cafesofie has joined the channel
[19:07] roka: but i like my site to be accessable without port declaration..
[19:08] bnoordhuis: roka: google for `iptables redirect`
[19:08] Skola: why over 9000?
[19:08] konobi: process.setuid()
[19:09] bnoordhuis: Skola: know your internet memes
[19:09] frewsxcv: roka: what you're looking for is a 'reverse proxy' (like nginx)
[19:09] roka: to set node behind nginx?
[19:09] Skola: xkcd?
[19:10] frewsxcv: make run nginx run on 80, have node run on port X. tell nginx to forward all traffic to your web server (or a certain directory, like myserver.com/node) to go to port X
[19:10] v0idless- has joined the channel
[19:11] frewsxcv: roka: do you have anything else running on port 80?
[19:11] shinuza has joined the channel
[19:11] pifantastic has joined the channel
[19:11] roka: at the moment there just node installed
[19:12] frewsxcv: why not just run that on 80 then?
[19:12] bnoordhuis: Skola: more like 4chan
[19:12] Skola: ;p
[19:12] frewsxcv: Skola: if you had multiple things on port 80 you wanted to run, like tomcat, apache, and node, then you'd want to use a reverse proxy
[19:13] roka: i tried running ode o port 80, but theres the problem :)
[19:14] frewsxcv: roka: what's the error?
[19:14] roka: i try install nginx and redirect that
[19:14] frewsxcv: roka: most likely it's because you are not root
[19:14] tbranyen: yeah pretty much
[19:14] thejh: +1
[19:14] roka:  throw e; // process.nextTick error, or 'error' event on first tick 
[19:14] frewsxcv: if you want to bind an application to anything below port 1024, you need to be root
[19:14] roka: okay
[19:15] tbranyen: roka: try running it with root privs to see if it helps, if that fixes it, install and configure authbind
[19:15] newy_ has joined the channel
[19:15] tbranyen: and run it with that as a non-root user
[19:16] Skola: anyone here familiar with compiling coffeescript at app runtime? (Express)
[19:16] frewsxcv: tbranyen: does that allow a user to bind to <1024?
[19:16] tbranyen: frewsxcv: yea
[19:16] roka: do you run node as root or sudo or as user?
[19:16] insin has joined the channel
[19:17] tbranyen: roka: in a production environment you probably want to run it as a non-root user, in development sudo/root works fine

[19:30] Swizec: question: when calling a callback in a function, is it automagically called at next tick, or immediately?
[19:30] frewsxcv: Swizec: i too am wondering that
[19:32] McMAGIC--Copy has joined the channel
[19:32] philtor has joined the channel
[19:32] Swizec: any idea how to find out?
[19:33] bnoordhuis: Swizec: what do you mean exactly?
[19:34] brimster has joined the channel
[19:34] Swizec: bnoordhuis say I'm doing this: something(arg1, function (result) { // do something with result })
[19:34] kkaefer: Swizec: immediately
[19:34] Swizec: basic "asynchronous" code, with callbacks
[19:34] Swizec: is it automagically asynchronous, or not?
[19:34] kkaefer: Swizec: if you want to call it at the next tick, you have to use process.nextTick ;)
[19:35] Swizec: so all the asynchronous code I've been writing isn't really asynchronous at all?
[19:35] Swizec: that seems ... harsh
[19:35] piscisaureus_: Node core modules do schedule the callback for the next tick. User modules might not.
[19:35] kkaefer: it's async in some sense
[19:35] kkaefer: but it /will/ block the event loop
[19:36] kkaefer: e.g. if you have a long running loop in javascript
[19:36] fairwinds has joined the channel
[19:36] kkaefer: other event callbacks won't be called unless that loop ends
[19:36] kkaefer: s/unless/until/
[19:36] Swizec: that sucks
[19:36] kkaefer: why?
[19:37] Swizec: well because you usually want to call the callback asynchronously
[19:37] kkaefer: not always
[19:37] Swizec: oh?
[19:37] kkaefer: when you use process.nextTick(), you lose all stack trace information for example
[19:37] kkaefer: there's process.nextTick() if you want to defer the call
[19:38] kkaefer: so it really depends on what you're doing
[19:38] Swizec: yeah, I guess
[19:38] Skola: is it ok in Express to put models/routes in your /public?
[19:38] Skola: or is public generally reserved for client-side code?
[19:39] kkaefer: Skola: that's totally up to you
[19:39] kkaefer: express doesn't force anything upon you
[19:39] aurynn has joined the channel

[19:41] frewsxcv: so if i have "something(arg1, function () { console.log('meow') })" and "something2(arg2, function() { console.log('woof') })", do i have a guarantee that meow is going to run before something2?
[19:41] bazookatooth: ++
[19:42] bnoordhuis: frewsxcv: entirely depends on what something and something2 do
[19:42] frewsxcv: exapmle?
[19:42] bazookatooth: so, no?
[19:42] bnoordhuis: frewsxcv: if those functions defer callback invocation, there are no guarantees what callback will run first
[19:43] frewsxcv: bnoordhuis: how would i know?
[19:43] frewsxcv: in my case, i have a callback create a database
[19:43] bnoordhuis: frewsxcv: look at the source or the documentation

[20:21] isaacs: espressive: if you install it locally, you'll get it via require()"
[20:22] espressive: thought the latest nodejs version might contain a fix that will resolve the path issue
[20:22] isaacs: espressive: npm help folders
[20:22] isaacs: espressive: there is no issue.  it works how it works on purpose.
[20:22] espressive: ah ok
[20:22] isaacs: espressive: cd into your project, npm install whatever, and then you'll be able to require("whatever")
[20:22] isaacs: espressive: if you installed it globally, and want to use the global one, then `npm link whatever` to create a symlink, but that's really just a dev tool
[20:22] espressive: cool, let me try this

[21:23] justinw312: Oh, I see. 
[21:23] marcello3d: looks like 0.5.x, so couldn't tell you, it could be a completely broken state

[21:23] justinw312: I see why thats failing

[21:27] marcello3d: christkv_: around?
[21:27] darshanshankar: i assumed it was just on 2.no.de
[21:28] marcello3d: darshanshankar: well, I'll admit I spent very little time trying to get it running in a production-style environment — the node part runs fine, but the mongodb server randomly shuts down on no.de
[21:28] darshanshankar: ah gotcha
[21:29] marcello3d: but it's great that someone is actually interested enough to miss it :)
[21:29] darshanshankar: ive been missing it man!
[21:29] marcello3d: well
[21:30] marcello3d: it can only run 60 github hits a minute
[21:30] marcello3d: so it'll probably take an hour to update everything, assuming duostack doesn't shut it down again
[21:30] marcello3d: half an hour

[21:40] sstephenson: length is a property, not a function

[21:52] Marak: think about that
[21:52] Marak: i dunno how else we could fix this

[21:53] TooTallNate: modules can just use (str.originalLength || str.length) of they want to be color.js-aware
[21:53] TooTallNate: Marak: I agree
[21:53] Marak: TooTallNate: could i just add the destyle method right before padding is calculated?
[21:53] Marak: its like 3 lines
[21:53] TooTallNate: or ('destyle' in str ? str.destyle.length : str.length)
[21:53] TooTallNate: like that
[21:54] Marak: var code = /\u001b\[\d+m/g; function destyle (s){   return ("" + s).replace(code,''); }

[22:05] christkv_: @mraleph I have a feeling I can get the bson.js parser speed up by following some of your tips. It's about 50% of the speed of the C++ version. I'm hoping to narrow the window so it becomes a production worth parser
[22:05] christkv_: @marcello3d the profiling tools
[22:05] marcello3d: ah
[22:06] marcello3d: I'm working on a js bson parser, as well

[22:13] Marak: interesting 
[22:13] Marak: very interesting 
[22:13] TooTallNate: that might work
[22:13] TooTallNate: it's breaking though
[22:13] Marak: TooTallNate: how so?
[22:13] TooTallNate: v8: var obj = { length : 555, toString : function () { return 'y!!!!!' } }; typeof obj
[22:13] v8bot: TooTallNate: "object"
[22:13] TooTallNate: pretty minor though
[22:13] Marak: do you do typeof string?
[22:13] SubStack: if you don't check for that it'll work
[22:13] TooTallNate: oh yes!
[22:13] Marak: that is kinda heinous still
[22:14] TooTallNate: as opposed to 'instanceof String' that is
[22:14] Marak: yeah
[22:14] TooTallNate: it would be sweet if this FakeString had all the regular functions too
[22:15] TooTallNate: and like .substring returned a colored string like you'd expect it to

[22:17] TooTallNate: fuck yeah
[22:17] SubStack: typeof still won't work

[22:56] marcello3d: nope
[22:56] coreb: would be interesting
[22:56] marcello3d: yep
[22:56] marcello3d: I'm focusing on developer ease-of-use
[22:57] marcello3d: and simplicity
[22:57] bazookatooth has joined the channel
[22:57] coreb: 10gen should support an official driver soon though
[22:57] xerox: SubStack: maybe nodejs has got a lexer hidden somewhere
[22:57] xerox: and I can just leverage it for my purposes
[22:57] marcello3d: coreb: yea, probably

[22:58] ggg: anyone knows a good link to explain the callback principles in node.js, it seems to be something worth knowing to develop node modules, and im not sure to quite understand what it does
[22:59] xerox: ggg: it's called continuation passing style
[22:59] xastey: if its async add a callback, and maybe an "scope"
[22:59] coreb: marcello3d: and did they bring news?
[22:59] xerox: loooooooooots of resources on the web
[22:59] hassox has joined the channel
[22:59] marcello3d: coreb: I haven't talked to them lately, this was before I was doing much with node.js
[22:59] xastey: dont bash me.. but I find it funny that javascript is just not getting into event base coding
[23:00] coreb: marcello3d: what's your main platform?
[23:00] ggg: thank you
[23:00] marcello3d: coreb: what do you mean?
[23:01] bazookatooth has joined the channel
[23:01] coreb: what language do you usually develop in, as you're referring to your time previous to node.js
[23:01] marcello3d: oh, I was messing with scala before then switched to ndoe
[23:01] marcello3d: *node
[23:02] coreb: ah, the jvm
[23:02] coreb: the play! framework for scala and java looks nice though
[23:02] marcello3d: yea, that's what I was using
[23:02] marcello3d: but I just got tired of scala's annoyances
[23:02] marcello3d: and the node.js community is way cooler :)
[23:02] coreb: good framework though
[23:03] ggg: did you try java ee? i found it annoying
[23:03] coreb: the node.js community probably has a lot more momentum
[23:03] coreb: done business with java ee, yeah
[23:03] marcello3d: coreb: bit too much black magic for my tastes
[23:03] coreb: marcello3d: what, the play! fw?
[23:03] marcello3d: is there a node.js function for knowing the utf-8 length of a string without serializing it?
[23:04] mwhooker has joined the channel
[23:04] coreb: why not just serialize it
[23:05] coreb: every characted needs to be checked
[23:05] coreb: character
[23:05] marcello3d: yea
[23:05] marcello3d: I think I'll make an array of buffers and just join them at the end
[23:05] SubStack: xerox: what are you doing parsing for?
[23:05] xerox: SubStack: irc bot, to feed the arguments of a command to the corresponding arguments of the function
[23:06] hellp2 has joined the channel
[23:08] xerox: SubStack: I just got an idea
[23:08] xerox: string.split(/\s{2,}/)
[23:08] xerox: :))))
[23:08] Marak: there we go, https://github.com/Marak/cli-table/commit/18b8c3e2fe79c6726362ee19c003fe444a6cbaf5
[23:08] Marak: pull requested, moves on you now!
[23:08] Marak: THERE WILL BE COLORS
[23:08] ggg: so the concept of non-blocking, isnt in node itself, but its more in the way the developer codes, making there isnt any blocking possibility?
[23:09] Charuru has joined the channel
[23:09] coreb: ggg: io is done async
[23:10] bosphorus has joined the channel
[23:10] coreb: but sure, the developer must make sure not to do blocking
[23:11] ggg: so, I have a http server, and a fonction that checks the url paramters via req.url and from this it sends an hardcoded json, is this non-blocking?
[23:12] tschundeee has joined the channel
[23:12] coreb: your server side logic with checking the url params and getting the hardcoded json does block, but only for a very short time
[23:12] coreb: the writing of the response does not block
[23:13] bosphorus: hello
[23:13] bosphorus: how can i make custom async calls in node.js
[23:13] supster has joined the channel
[23:13] bosphorus: i'm having something like this: http://pastebin.com/98mjv3c0
[23:14] bosphorus: each foo.bar is just socket.write 'foo N'
[23:14] bosphorus: and they are always in the same order (1,2,3)
[23:14] ggg: so, how would I make it non-blocking ?
[23:14] AvianFlu has joined the channel
[23:14] coreb: ggg: not possible, the point is to make sure your code blocks only for a very short time
[23:15] coreb: ggg: the io is usually what matters, and that's non blocking in node.js
[23:15] coreb: your algorithms will block
[23:16] TheCoreh has joined the channel
[23:16] mpoz2 has joined the channel
[23:16] ggg: so, the sockets.io is non blocking, or by io you mean input output under the hood of node.js that the coder doesnt touch ?

[23:18] TheCoreh: just wondering, what's currently the prefered way of parsing XML in node.js?
[23:18] telemachus: by making it json?
[23:18] telemachus: :)
[23:19] TheCoreh: haha
[23:19] TheCoreh: i wish SVN would export commit logs as JSON
[23:19] TheCoreh: i need to mine some data from SVN commit logs
[23:20] TheCoreh: and the XML files it generates are like, 3-4MB in size for the repos i'm working with
[23:20] skm has joined the channel
[23:20] coreb: ggg: yes, it's taken care of under the hood with os specific handling of socket
[23:20] coreb: s
[23:20] xerox: http://code.google.com/p/xml2json-xslt/
[23:20] xerox: :x
[23:23] telemachus: TheCoreh: Maybe useful? http://blog.lagentz.com/nodejs/nodejs-parsing-and-transforming-large-xml-documents/
[23:23] ggg: good. thanks for the clarification
[23:24] coreb: ggg: node operates with one process and one thread

[23:24] Marak: coreb: maybe your nodes do! :-D
[23:25] coreb: Marak: what's that, because you're using cluster?
[23:25] ggg: reading about thread vs processes (school is far in my memory)
[23:25] telemachus: TheCoreh: The only other thing a quick look around came up with is this, but it looks like it hasn't been updated for a bit (may not matter, but node itself changes quickly): https://github.com/polotek/libxmljs
[23:25] Marak: coreb: hook.io
