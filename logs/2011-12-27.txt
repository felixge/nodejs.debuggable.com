[00:06] zomg: I have some objects which stay in memory to do various things, but their configuration is stored in mongo... now they just go out of sync whenever I forget to have the in memory ones be updated when saving changes to the configuration

[00:11] zomg: RLa: Sure but I keep forgetting to do it whenever I add some new code which changes stuff :D
[00:12] zomg: Perhaps I'll just change it so that the configuration object is referenced to from the in-memory object, that way I wouldn't need to copy values all over the place

[00:53] orospakr: So, node's FS module seems to assume that all filesystem pathnames are in UTF8.
[00:53] orospakr: This is both broken and sad. :(
[00:54] orospakr: It should use buffers by default.
[00:54] orospakr: I realized this when I got strings back from readdir() with bogus character in them, that if subimitted to open/stat/whatever, will fail with ENOENT.
[00:54] orospakr: and then I said, "wait, shit, those are JS strings I'm getting back as filenames. well crap."
[00:55] [[zzz]] has joined the channel
[00:55] orospakr: it should be returning Buffers, while supporting the input of strings for convenience.
[00:55] orospakr: POSIX pathnames are octet strings, *not* UTF8.
[00:55] RLa: i think this has something to do with v8 encodings support
[00:56] orospakr: RLa, yeah, but encodings are kind of out of scope for filenames.  I mean, I may want to render them to an encoded string at some point, but when I'm still using them at the FS level, UTF-8 or any other encoding is out of scope.

[01:50] zodiak: this is perhaps a bit of a 'duh' question/statement.. but.. I normally use scheme and have gotten into clojure, and I have been trying to write node.js in an OO style.. is node/js more fp ?
[01:50] zodiak: I notice my node methods all being about 5-6 lines long.. and it reminds me of clojure a fair bit.. am I mad ?
[01:50] zomg: I guess it depends
[01:51] zomg: When you have state and methods which act on the state you can use OO, when you have lists and such you can map/filter/reduce over them etc.
[01:51] zodiak: zomg, so (in your mind) it's sort of a hybrid of the two ?
[01:51] zomg: Something like that yeah
[01:51] Charuru has joined the channel
[01:52] zodiak: zomg, interesting. I am wondering, which is the way you (personally) write node/js .. more OO or FP ?
[01:53] zodiak: I think I may have been doing js all wrong these years :)
[01:53] jesusabdullah: You really want both.
[01:53] mandric has joined the channel
[01:53] jesusabdullah: Keep in mind, OO doesn't mean classes
[01:54] zodiak: jesusabdullah, no, I understand OO != only classes (encapsuation, extension, etc) 
[01:54] jesusabdullah: right
[01:54] jesusabdullah: but you're not mad for seeing fp in js

[01:56] zodiak: HAH! lisp in c's clothing.. interesting :D
[01:56] jesusabdullah: Like, the lisp-like features are intentional
[01:56] jesusabdullah: yeah
[01:56] jesusabdullah: it's fairly well-known
[01:56] zomg: I use map and filter a lot when working with arrays if I need to get a subset or some specific data out (say ID's of all objects)
[01:56] zodiak: zomg, right! I found a library called Udon the other day. Lots of map/foldl etc
[01:56] zomg: but I also use "classes" when it seems reasonable
[01:56] zodiak: jesusabdullah, *phew* :D

[01:57] zodiak: thanks for the heads up .. and confirming I am not (that) mad ;)

[01:57] insin: JavaScript's tagline should be "yeah, well, that's just like your opinion, or something"
[01:57] zomg: Although I don't really consider JS that functional... say compare to Haskell it's nothing like that =)
[01:58] zodiak: zomg, well, no. it's not =that= level of crazy ;)
[01:58] zomg: It just has the convenient fp-ish ability to pass functions around and anonymous funcs etc.
[01:58] zodiak: then again, I loathe how scala is trying to blend oo and fp .. that language.. bothers me. it .. jst feels .. 'wrong'
[01:58] zomg: Yeah I've heard that comment about Scala before
[01:58] zodiak: hard to explain. personal bias I reckon.
[01:58] jesusabdullah: insin: That's just, like your opinion, man.

[02:03] Dmitrijus: zodiak: well, having pure functions is much more important imo :) 
[02:04] zodiak: Dmitrijus, agreed. I *heart* clojure for it's purity, but I also *heart* node for it's "get stuff done' ;>
[02:04] Dmitrijus: zodiak: i mean, hey, you can even pass functions in c! :)

[02:07] Dmitrijus: oh dude
[02:07] Dmitrijus: c++ is the crap++
[02:07] Dmitrijus: c++ IS NO WAY EASIER
[02:07] Shaunzie: O.O
[02:08] tjfontaine: blame gnu, clang+llvm is better
[02:08] Shaunzie: STL isn't that bad :-/
[02:10] tjfontaine: also re: c++ webapp an interesting framework is http://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt it didn't make me want to completely tear out my eyes
[02:10] jesusabdullah: I suspect that c++'s biggest problem is just its size, and that if you stick to a manageable subset you're okay
[02:10] jesusabdullah: my understanding are that a lot of projects end up choosing some manageable subset of c++ to focus on, often dictated by their choices in libraries
[02:10] jesusabdullah: but idk that much about it truth be told
[02:10] jesusabdullah: I just read wikipedia sometimes :)

[02:12] jesusabdullah: Dmitrijus: Maybe you like some of c++'s features but not all of them
[02:13] jesusabdullah: for example, I believe v8 uses templates like crazy
[02:13] jesusabdullah: At least, this is what I've heard
[02:13] jesusabdullah: maybe templates are really cool or something XD
[02:13] Shaunzie: TroyMG: not that I know of , but I stopped looking. I ended up making better use of partials, helpers and node-validator+express-validator
[02:13] jesusabdullah: tjfontaine: have you heard of the gobject system?
[02:13] Aria: V8 uses templates, but not in crazy ways.
[02:13] tjfontaine: jesusabdullah: have you *looked* at that awful copypaste mess?
[02:13] Aria: Actually, it's a reasonably good problem space for templates.
[02:13] TroyMG: thanks Shaunzie. thats too bad, but I guess I'll go down the same path
[02:13] jesusabdullah: Aria: But to a significant capacity right? That's what I meant
[02:14] Aria: (Since it's managing another language's resources, templates are a reasonable fit.)
[02:14] Aria: ("Typenameonourside<ObjectTypeFromTheOtherSide>")
[02:14] pointlessjon has joined the channel
[02:14] Dmitrijus: Aria: hm, cool :)
[02:14] tjfontaine: also you dont' get to argue the weight of c++ and suggest gobject in the same conversation
[02:14] Shaunzie: Templates are actually kinda cool when used well. Really cool, scary as hell, but still really cool :3
[02:15] Aria: V8 doesn't exercise templates in ways that make the size balloon -- STL, on the other hand, does. Watch compilation time go through the roof as the compiler makes specializations for each instance of a type when it's used pervasively.
[02:15] jesusabdullah: tjfontaine: I haven't! I just think it's interesting that they would develop this gobject thing instead of using c++
[02:15] jesusabdullah: I wonder why they did it
[02:15] Aria: V8 keeps the number of combinations down.
[02:15] Dmitrijus: Shaunzie: well, complex, harder to debug and so on. :)
[02:15] Aria: Hehe. gobject is actually also really excellent. It's pretty much OOP done in C as well as you can do OOP in C. It's clean, extensible, understandable.
[02:16] Dmitrijus: Aria: yep
[02:16] Aria: Also, closer to the metal than most uses of C++
[02:16] Aria: You can really see what it's doing.
[02:16] tjfontaine: gobject has its use cases, but it's not a swiss army knife to be sure
[02:16] Shaunzie: Dmitrijus: yah more or less. but sometimes the benefits out way the risks :3

[03:47] Lingerance: What's so bad about their runtime?

[06:07] Lingerance: My code is plenty colorful enough

[06:08] benvie: yeah the color can be turned off
[06:08] TroyMG: out of curiosity, does console.log(o) pass through to util.inspect if o is not a string?
[06:08] benvie: yeah all the console stuff does
[06:09] benvie: er
[06:09] benvie: if you inspect an object
[06:09] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[06:09] Dmitrijus: benvie: sure sure :)
[06:09] benvie: if it's formatted it's util.inspect
[06:09] TroyMG: k, thats what I thought
[06:09] TroyMG: I stopped using util.inspect because console.log seemed to do the same thing if passed an object rather than a string
[06:10] benvie: util.inspect just let's you set the options manually
[06:10] benvie: like if you want more depth
[06:10] benvie: I have another project for adding a lot more stuff to the repl too
[06:10] TroyMG: ah, k thanks
[06:10] benvie: like .depth 4
[06:10] benvie: .hiddens
[06:10] benvie: .colors

[06:10] benvie: toggles for that stuff
[06:10] davetayls has joined the channel
[06:11] TroyMG: nice. looking fwd to the colors :-)
[06:11] benvie: also fixed contexts, the ability to generate more contexts and cycle through them

[06:11] benvie: it's awesome
[06:11] windsurf_ has joined the channel

[06:14] benvie: it quotes strings with the quote that would result in the least amount of backslashes to escape the string so most of the time quotes don't need to be escaped

[06:14] cyborg: b
[06:14] TroyMG: thats clever
[06:15] benvie: the test cases for that are funny
[06:15] benvie: assert.equal(util.inspect("''\""), '"\'\'\\""');
[06:15] Shaunzie: https://github.com/tblobaum/express-subdomains === love
[06:17] TroyMG: Shaunzie: thats slick. watched
[06:19] benvie: also an addition to the repl so that if you type a builtin libraries name as a command it auto requires it for you
[06:19] benvie: fs
[06:19] benvie: and adds it to the context
[06:20] Lingerance: Huzzah!
[06:20] Lingerance: That'll be in 0.6.7?
[06:21] benvie: no, that one I'm waiting for feedback on the pull request
[06:21] benvie: submitted it during the christmas exodus
[06:21] benvie: the more complicated context stuff I'm going to make as a module for now
[06:22] benvie: that completely redoes the way things are set up in new VM contexts because the way node does it now is broken. But having fixed it with some javascript magic, it's friggen awesome
[06:22] benvie: I set it up so pageup, pagedown cycles the contexts
[06:22] benvie: and they're all isolated contexts with their own stuff and inspect works
[06:23] notifybot2 has joined the channel
[06:23] benvie: you can add new ones with ctrl+insert and delete them with ctrl+delete
[06:23] harthur has joined the channel

[15:54] tuhoojabotti: niloy_: Apparently, it is possible to get mac address from the router with an iframe exploit.
[15:54] tuhoojabotti: :D
[15:54] mongrelion: lol
[15:54] niloy_: tuhoojabotti: really? but I am talking about node here?
[15:55] tuhoojabotti: niloy_: Sure, but yeah the point is you can't
[15:55] tuhoojabotti: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ctRfWnisSk it's funny though
[15:55] slickplaid: s/cant/shouldnt/
[15:56] slickplaid: if you really want their mac address, you can probably get it somehow
[15:56] tuhoojabotti: True
[15:56] slickplaid: but the question is, do you /really/ need it?
[15:56] slickplaid: kind of a privacy thing, I would think
[15:56] niloy_: i made a nodejs server for use in our office, I want to be able to display names instead of IP, but everyone has dynamic IP, so mac address would help
[15:57] c4milo has joined the channel
[15:57] Pilate: or you could just implement some sort of auth
[15:57] slickplaid: niloy_, if you network is set up properly, you can probably get it... but why use a MAC address for that? why not auth or ip?
[15:57] tuhoojabotti: set up static ips
[15:57] matejv has joined the channel
[15:57] niloy_: everyone has dynamic IP, auth is overkill
[15:58] Pilate: 'enter your name' is more overkill than trying to get mac addresses via a router exploit?
[15:58] slickplaid: cookies? sessions? trivial to implement
[15:58] niloy_: 'enter your name' is simple but can be faked too easily
[15:58] slickplaid: ahh you guys are killing me... I'm suppose to be working :D
[15:58] RLa: display names instead of IP <- what names? human or dns?
[15:58] Pilate: youre using it for your office
[15:58] niloy_: RLa: human names
[15:59] tuhoojabotti: Some one kick slickplaid 
[15:59] niloy_: Pilate: yes
[15:59] Pilate: how much of a problem will 'faking' be? and if faking is an issue, you can fake mac addresses
[15:59] Pilate: in which case your whole system is garbage
[15:59] slickplaid: tuhoojabotti, don't tempt them, I've been kicked out of here before :D
[15:59] niloy_: Pilate: I know, but they aint that tech savvy
[15:59] tuhoojabotti: lol
[15:59] RLa: is there central ldap in office, mybe you can use that?
[16:00] christophsturm has joined the channel
[16:00] slickplaid: how big of an office? how many segments? Just rig the dhcp to hand out static ip's for each mac
[16:00] slickplaid: then you have an IP tied to the mac address
[16:01] slickplaid: then use the IP
[16:01] niloy_: slickplaid: that is possible, but thats not my job!

[16:03] _unary has joined the channel
[16:03] slickplaid: there is probably a hundered and one ways you can go about this, but every one we've suggested you don't want to do... why are you so hung up on the mac address solution and *only* using a mac address?
[16:03] tuhoojabotti: niloy_: It's actually in the beginning of this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJtmZZGcR54
[16:04] niloy_: because its transparent to the end user, appears like a magic :D
[16:04] niloy_: tujoojabotti: lemme check it out
[16:05] tjfontaine: you could use the node pcap stuff and get the mac address that way

[17:48] slloyd_air has joined the channel
[17:49] mattgifford has joined the channel
[17:49] Naked: AndreasMadsen: the plain EventEmitter doesn't catch exceptions, so calling emit() on it will just propagate the exception to the caller if some listener throws an exception
[17:49] Naked: AndreasMadsen: however, this doesn't seem to be the case for TCP connections, where if a 'data' event listener throws an exception, an 'error' event is emitted and the stream closed
[17:50] Naked: AndreasMadsen: and I'm trying to find out the lines in the code where this behaviour is implemented...
[17:50] AndreasMadsen: Naked: I have seen that code line - standby
[17:50] Naked: AndreasMadsen: for 'connect' event this is obvious: try { this.emit('connect'); } catch (e) { this.destroy(e); return; }
[17:51] Naked: AndreasMadsen: but I can't find out which part of code does it for 'data'

[17:53] AndreasMadsen: Naked: I know, just wanted to be sure will look intro the exact issue :)

[20:41] orospakr: what's the best way to schedule something onto the next mainloop iteration, rather than setTimeout(cb, 0)?
[20:41] tbranyen: orospakr: nextTick
[20:41] orospakr: aha!
[20:41] orospakr: I suspected I would recognize it the minute I heard it
[20:41] josephmoniz: nextTick makes me cringe
[20:41] orospakr: thanks.
[20:42] bemson: josephmoniz: is it bad form? - I'm a node-newb...
[20:42] josephmoniz: you should never use nextTick to do work that should be shipped to a worker node instead
[20:42] asc_: hi, i have a build problem with node-v0.6.6 on osx.5.8 (Leopard). Anybody still using node on 10.5.8 ?
[20:42] orospakr: josephmoniz, I'm recursing through callbacks of readdir, and I think that I need to break out of the callback from readdir, otherwise I leak the directory stream descriptors.
[20:42] josephmoniz: if you have nodes serving clients then you want their event loops spinning as fast as possible
[20:42] josephmoniz: anything that will take time should be shipped off to worker nodes
[20:43] FiveLemon has left the channel
[20:43] josephmoniz: using request/response patterns with message brokers should suffice
[20:43] orospakr: feh. it didn't work.
[20:43] bemson: josephmoniz: taking time is the criteria then? A delayed server response should not use nextTick but setTimout
[20:43] devongovett has joined the channel
[20:43] josephmoniz: IE: RabbitMQ, redis message passing, Postgres NOTIFY/SUBSCRIBE
[20:43] orospakr: josephmoniz, oh, ah, that's a different class of problem that's out of scope for this.
[20:44] josephmoniz: bemson: nope
[20:44] josephmoniz: anything thats going to take time shouldn't take place in the client serving node process
[20:44] orospakr: I only use things like nextTick if I want to continue my current scope, and and push something out, not to deal with time-consuming stuff.
[20:44] josephmoniz: in a perfect world the client serving node process should have it's event loops spinning as fast as possible
[20:45] GrizzLyCRO has joined the channel
[20:45] bemson: josephmoniz: I understand about "going to take time", but what if I want the server to take it's time, even though it's not doing anything rigorous - like delaying a server response
[20:45] josephmoniz: bemson: you can delay response with a timeout
[20:45] bemson: josephmoniz: is that not the same as setTimeout?
[20:45] Cromulent has joined the channel
[20:45] josephmoniz: bemson: yes that is
[20:46] josephmoniz: time delays caused by computation is what i was referring to

[20:46] bemson: josephmoniz: thx for clarifying things for me
[20:46] josephmoniz: IE: anything that gets in the way of the event loop spinning as fast as it can

[21:47] PureRumble: In MyError constructor I do MyError.super_.call(this, "some error-msg")
[21:47] bradleymeck: inheriting errors will not give you stack traces
[21:48] PureRumble: That's not my question/problem
[21:48] PureRumble: But then when I do throw new MyError(), I don't get the error-message "some error-msg"
[21:49] PureRumble: However, if I go this.message="some error-msg" instead of the MyError.super_ call, then the message gets properly set
[21:49] LeMike has joined the channel
[21:50] PureRumble: But I'm trying to understand, what am I doing wrong here? Aint MyError.super_.call the proper way to invoke the superconstructor from a constructor? Why won't it properly set attributes?

[21:52] PureRumble: sorry for being so java/c++-ish :)
[21:52] bradleymeck: use error, set properties, is there a reason you need to classify your errors using instanceof or prototype out methods unique to them?
[21:53] jacobolus has joined the channel
[21:54] PureRumble: I'm mainly concerned with using try/catch - blocks with instanceof in the latter. This way I can in relevant scenarios keep track of what type of error has occured and act on it
[21:55] FG_ has joined the channel
[21:55] PureRumble: You know, just like the "old-school" way of doing in other languages: try/catch(a)/catch(b)/catch(c)... and so on
[21:55] josephmoniz: you shouldn't use exceptions in node.js
[21:55] josephmoniz: node.js has a great error passing paradigm
[21:55] josephmoniz: in haskell it's called the Either data type
[21:56] josephmoniz: http://josephmoniz.github.com/blog/2011/12/14/js-pass-pattern/ << how i deal with errors in node
[21:56] orospakr: how do I build a node module in place? I've manually checked something out into my project's node_modules.
[21:56] bradleymeck: you should use errors if you call things with bad arguments and/or need stack traces but thats besides the point.
[21:57] josephmoniz: errors good, exceptions bad
[21:57] josephmoniz: thow + exceptions are great for crashing programs
[21:57] bradleymeck: purerumble don't deal with errors as types, check values relating to how to deal with the error (a common step is to give err.code equal to the kind of http code it should reply with)
[21:57] josephmoniz: and i'm not being sarcastic when i say that, you should use them like asserts

[22:02] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[22:03] PureRumble: bradleymeck, so to distinguish among various scenarios when some Error occurs, you suggest to use an ordinary Error-obj and to piggy-back it with some attributes?
[22:03] dubenstein has joined the channel
[22:04] PureRumble: Like say for instance you access some DB from your code, and for some bizarre reason you need to know if it was an insert or delete that went wrong in the case of an error. How would you do it? :)
[22:04] bradleymeck: PureRumble, correct, piggy back it with relevant info to how to deal with the error, not with what the error is (error inspection is something that should be logged and dealt with when you don't know what to do with an error programatically (generally a restart)).
[22:04] bradleymeck: so for your example
[22:05] JaKWaC has joined the channel
[22:05] dubenstein has joined the channel
[22:06] bradleymeck: I would say that the current request flat out failed, then reboot the server, if this is a transaction with multiple steps things get interesting
[22:06] bradleymeck: if you can deal with the transaction failing return something with .code of 500 or so
[22:07] bradleymeck: multistep transactions will need to have an ORM or something keep track of steps for rollback

[22:11] cognominal_ has joined the channel
[22:12] Naked: those have stacktraces and follow the correct "error" behavior in everything
[22:12] bradleymeck: Naked, the only thing you get with custom errors is the instanceof operator :/

[22:12] ben_alman: (bug reported to npm)
[22:14] martndemus has joined the channel
[22:14] Naked: bradleymeck: ...and actual prototypal class behaviour of custom errors, if you have custom methods or override something etc.
[22:15] bradleymeck: Naked, if your errors are taking action instead of the actor that caused the error :(
[22:15] ben_alman: when i'm dealing with simple internal errors i'll often just throw {name: "SomeError", message: "This is the rror message"};
[22:15] ben_alman: it doesn't log as pretty but it's just as functional if errors will always be consumed by code
[22:16] Naked: ben_alman: which fails even the isError test...
[22:16] ben_alman: again, simple internal errors
[22:16] ben_alman: what is "the isError test" ?
[22:16] pquerna: Marak: nice post :)

[22:17] ben_alman: ah. i wasn't thinking node-specific js
[22:17] ben_alman: just generic js
[22:18] tbranyen: why would you want to know if you had an error object or not?
[22:18] Naked: bradleymeck: yes, you can structure all your classes so that no values have any functionality, only static class method
[22:18] bradleymeck: tbranyen, you generally don't care but you might want a stack trace (i know we log a ton of errors even if they never reach top scope)
[22:19] ben_alman: yeah {} error object won't log pretty-like
[22:19] Naked: tbranyen: the common use case for that (for me) is to promote thrown strings and other stuff in to actual error objects so they have the usual toString() behavior and have .stack etc.
[22:19] tbranyen: thats fair enough, wonder if node.js uses that function internally
[22:20] bradleymeck: Naked you don't have to have everything static, but an error value taking action is eventually going to cause the problem of the caller wanting to know the problem and deal with it (or not deal with it for that matter)
[22:20] ben_alman: throw {name: "SomeError", message: "This is the rror message", toString: Error.prototype.toString};

[22:27] martndemus has joined the channel

[22:27] NHQ: yes
[22:28] PureRumble: NHQ, what difference does it make how big the integers are?
[22:29] PureRumble: a file = stream of bits. A buffer = stream of bits. Doesnt matter how the buff represents the bits internally. Or am I missing something here?
[22:29] NHQ: Its just that I tested sending an .rtf document as an array buffer. When I packed it up as 8bit unsigned, node transcoded it accurately. When I sent it as a 16 bit unsigned array, it did not "turn out"

[22:33] bemson: the first plugin is called "core", and wondered if I should name it's npm module "Flow-core"
[22:33] zwiep: question, example on stream documentation to emulate cat: first it resumes process.stdin, next it sets up the pipe to process.stdout. i would expect the other way around since a readable stream could start emitting the moment you resume it?

[22:35] bradleymeck: bemson sounds fine, if you need a plugin system you might also want to look to broadway as a way to manage plugins in the future
[22:35] chapel: any news on nodeconf?
[22:35] bemson: I recall viewing that repo a while backâ€¦ have you used it?
[22:36] bradleymeck: zwiep, events happen on the next tick you have until the stack unwinds to set everything up
[22:36] bemson: bradleymeck: sorry, that question about broadway was to you - have you used it?
[22:37] bradleymeck: bemson, yep, we use it quite a bit since we made it XP, have made several plugins for haibu/haibu-carapace for internal use as well as some public ones

[22:38] Morkel has joined the channel
[22:38] zwiep: bradleymeck, trying to wrap my head around your answer.. err..
[22:39] bradleymeck: zwiep since node is a single thread no events will be queued up and fired until the stack unwinds since they must be added to the event loop
[22:39] BrianE has joined the channel
[22:39] bradleymeck: similar to how setTimeout in a browser will not fire until the stack unwinds
[22:40] styol has joined the channel
[22:41] jsurfer has joined the channel
[22:41] bradleymeck: by stack unwinding i mean all current functions have completed and returned (or thrown,... or yielded when v8 gets that...)
[22:41] zwiep: bradleymeck, i build a simple readable stream that emits data immediately after resuming; when i do that before setting up the pipe, nothing happens
[22:42] zwiep: so after your response i would not expect that to happen
[22:43] bradleymeck: if you manually emit data on a custom readable stream it will happen ASAP (before the stack unwinds) node avoids this by using process.nextTick

[22:50] zwiep: works in a pipe, but guess that's not the way to do it

[23:47] Industrial: This is my problem with adopting functional programming: I don't know how to program parts of the application if I'm not using OO things like Controllers, Models, Views for e.g. a HTTP app.
[23:47] Industrial: I could use a map instead of an each or a for in a model method :P
[23:47] Industrial: That's about my use of functional programming right now :\
[23:48] Industrial: Not sure how to improve this or say build the whole system in

[23:51] Industrial: What I don't understand is how it can replace my thinking of objects as collections of properties to pass around and modify
[23:51] Industrial: e.g. side-effect free
[23:51] Industrial: because that's how I think about data :p
