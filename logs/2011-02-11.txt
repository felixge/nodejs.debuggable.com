[00:00] isaacs: mnot: yeah
[00:00] isaacs: mnot: use main
[00:00] isaacs: mnot: don't use lib
[00:00] mnot: isaacs: what if I don't have a main?
[00:00] isaacs: mnot: then make one :)
[00:00] rauchg_: isaacs: 
[00:00] rauchg_: did you release `private` support yet ?
[00:00] Lorentz: Is there something like "pdo" for nodejs?
[00:00] Lorentz: Basically a lightweight db abstraction
[00:00] aurynn: Not really
[00:00] Lorentz: Or is everything still a bit too new for something like that to surface?
[00:01] isaacs: rauchg_: oh, i did, but right before the big 0.3.0 merge.
[00:01] isaacs: rauchg_: if you need it urgently, i can do a patch release
[00:01] aurynn: The major DB driver maintainers haven't sat down and agreed on dbi.js yet :)
[00:01] rauchg_: that'd be cool
[00:01] mnot: isaacs: the weird bit was that things worked fine when installing locally (npm install .) but fail utterly when doing it remotely. Makes debugging hard.
[00:01] Lorentz: aurynn: Thanks, not yet, huh
[00:01] aurynn: Lorentz, not yet.
[00:01] aurynn: Lorentz, but if you bug me, brianc, felixg and some other guy enough, it'll happen
[00:01] mnot: maybe npm should warn if there isn't a main, if it's effectively required?
[00:02] isaacs: mnot: good idea
[00:02] kris_ has joined the channel
[00:02] Lorentz: aurynn: Might bug you by starting up the project myself or something
[00:02] Lorentz: Too bad my plate's kinda full right now
[00:02] sholmes: hmm. I could have just pulled from the git repo if I already had a clone of it huh?
[00:02] aurynn: :)
[00:03] aurynn: Lorentz, I've got a decent amount of free time right now, and I've been wanting to champion dbi.js
[00:03] sholmes: I'm new to git/bash/node/CLI, but I'm loving it! :D
[00:04] Lorentz: aurynn: Please do, I'm starting up a store management application (at design phase now), and was wondering which db to use, and having something like dbi.js would give stores a choice.
[00:04] aurynn: Lorentz, I advise PG, but I'm weird like that :)
[00:04] isaacs: rauchg_: pushed
[00:04] isaacs: rauchg_: 0.2.18
[00:04] Lorentz: aurynn: I would indeed just keep with PG, but I don't like locking people into things.
[00:04] Lorentz: Sometimes you just don't get a choice.
[00:05] aurynn: Lorentz, a large problem comes in with the varying SQL compliance.
[00:05] aurynn: so even with a consistent API, your queries don't work. And the non-relational DBs have a lot of traction with noders.
[00:07] Lorentz: aurynn: My last store management project was in php and used PDO, and it handled it fine somehow (it really doesn't need anything complicated). I understand the technical variations in different DBs well enough though, at least to know how difficult it can get.
[00:07] mnot: isaacs: I think what's happening is that when I install locally, the directories are still getting copied to .node_libraries; however, when it's remote, they don't
[00:07] Lorentz: Typical crud, with a transaction here and there.
[00:07] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: you guys should have removed [[field, val]] for writeHead() in 0.4.0 :(
[00:08] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: i had nothing to do with the writeHead stuff
[00:08] Lorentz: aurynn: I looked at mongodb for a while, but seemed like it lacked transactions. At best it had isolation, but that's not really it.
[00:08] Lorentz: Other nosql-types are probably in similar situations, is my guess. Maybe couchdb has transactions?
[00:09] charlenopires has joined the channel
[00:09] Lorentz: Maybe I just have to change my way of thinking to do the traditional transactions and still keep it same functionally.
[00:09] aurynn: Lorentz, I'm not overly familiar with the noSQL stuff.
[00:10] aurynn: Lorentz, I'm going to be working with Cassandra, soon, though
[00:10] Lorentz: Hmm, cassandra. Haven't looked at it myself, no.
[00:11] quabner has joined the channel
[00:11] quabner: anyone here?
[00:11] aurynn: Lorentz, right now I maintain one of the PG drivers, and brianc one of the other ones
[00:11] quabner: when i try to run an nginx server on my ec2 instance it works
[00:12] quabner: when i run the script from the node.js front page
[00:12] quabner: it doesnt server anything to outside computers
[00:12] Lorentz: aurynn: I really think there should be only one driver.
[00:12] quabner: its only accessible from loclahost 
[00:12] quabner: how can i fix this?
[00:12] c4milo1 has joined the channel
[00:12] Lorentz: It's fragmenting things to have multiple options just for db drivers.
[00:12] aurynn: Lorentz, there's multiple drivers for most languages
[00:12] sholmes: I'm getting an error when making the build Build failed:  -> task failed (err #2):
[00:12] sholmes:         {task: libv8.a SConstruct -> libv8.a}

[00:13] quabner: http://ec2-184-73-68-139.compute-1.amazonaws.com/
[00:13] quabner: node running on port 80
[00:13] quabner: but nothing
[00:13] quabner: and nginx on 80 works
[00:13] Lorentz: aurynn: And I just think it's generally a bad idea. Well, there are benefits though. But still.

[00:16] sholmes: jonaslund: which comments?
[00:17] jotaru: Hello~
[00:17] sholmes: ah, found it.
[00:17] isaacs: mnot: a main module
[00:17] mnot: isaacs: and if you have additional modules? 
[00:17] isaacs: mnot: in 1.0, it will be possibleto do require("foo/lib/bar") to get at the lib folder.
[00:17] alek_br has joined the channel
[00:18] sholmes: when I echo $SHELL I get /bin/bash.
[00:18] isaacs: because the package will just be unpacked right there in ./node_modules
[00:18] sholmes: not C:\bin\bash
[00:18] isaacs: mnot: for the time being, export them off a main module.

[00:19] sholmes: still getting the same error even when I follow the instructions here: https://github.com/ry/node/wiki/Building-node.js-on-Cygwin-(Windows)
[00:21] sholmes: is node 0.4 compatible with cygwin?
[00:21] tanepiper: so isaacs with the new thing, if i have a folder call 'foobar' and put a package.json in there with a main pointing to './bar/baz/index.js' then i can just do require('foobar') ?
[00:21] dylan-awa: sholmes: it worked for me but i had to add an extra line break to the end of the file it was complaining about

[00:24] isaacs: i've been pronouncing it "rip" mentally, though i started out thinking of it as "ryp"
[00:24] isaacs: tanepiper: yeah
[00:24] jotaru: Hello guys, I see node has been upped to 0.4.. Is updating as simple as replaceing the old folder and installing (not using a pkg manager)
[00:24] isaacs: and then it installs the latest versions of everything.
[00:24] sholmes: I think it's working now. Thanks dylan-awa! :D
[00:24] isaacs: tanepiper: it doesn't mess around with "versions" and all that fancy crap
[00:25] tanepiper: cool, but lets us see where >= 0.5 is going i suppose

[00:30] tjholowaychuk: ryah / isaacs: https://gist.github.com/821692
[00:30] jonaslund: sholmes: looked at the comments at the bottom of that cygwin description file ?
[00:31] jonaslund: file/wikipage

[00:33] tjholowaychuk: no clue why we still support arrays
[00:33] tanepiper: hopfully it'll land, will help me with cookie-based auth for couchdb
[00:33] tjholowaychuk: just slows things down and clutters it up a lottt
[00:33] tjholowaychuk: if it doesnt land that api is useless
[00:33] tanepiper: yea

[00:34] tanepiper: this gets rid of my issues around storing couchdb auth information in the session, i can just log in and get an auth cookie and pass it in the heads of my requests
[00:35] sholmes: jonaslund: yes, I had to add a new-line to the end of /home/Holmes/node_v0.4.0/node/deps/v8/src/platform-cygwin.cc
[00:36] sholmes: maybe this newline should be in the next release?
[00:39] tanepiper: sholmes: yes, i suspect 0.4.1 will include a few cleanups and fixes, and better windows build stuff

[00:40] jonaslund: wonder why i didn't get that
[00:40] piscisaureus: I didn't need it :-)
[00:40] jonaslund: sholmes: gcc --version
[00:40] sholmes: idk why that's a big deal for cygwin, but that's what it was fussing about.
[00:40] Sebmaster: quabner: Youre just listening on 127.0.0.1, which is your local ip
[00:40] Sebmaster: quabner: Omit the IP parameter to listen on every interface

[00:41] quabner: ya ya
[00:41] jonaslund: hmm could be that
[00:41] quabner: i saw that now
[00:41] jonaslund: i have gcc 4
[00:41] quabner: im a complete idiot
[00:41] quabner: its also 2;41 here
[00:41] quabner: ty anyways
[00:41] sholmes: hmm, I wonder how to update gcc
[00:41] aurynn: apt-get upgrade gcc ?
[00:41] Sebmaster: i already submitted a pull request to ryah for the newline fix
[00:42] sholmes: no apt-get
[00:42] sholmes: it's a command not found.

[00:47] sholmes: how about libgcc1?
[00:47] jonaslund: hmm ?
[00:47] Sebmaster: sholmes: just gcc4 will do

[02:14] atmos: isaacs: around ?
[02:14] isaacs: yo
[02:14] isaacs: for about 15 more minutes, what's up?
[02:14] atmos: should i just be calling 'npm build' in a project to build my package ?
[02:15] isaacs: atmos: no!
[02:15] isaacs: atmos: what are you trying to do, exactly?
[02:15] atmos: package up a lib for the first time
[02:15] atmos: i've created my package.json file
[02:15] isaacs: atmos: ok
[02:15] isaacs: atmos: great.  it's a package.  you're done.
[02:15] isaacs: :)
[02:15] isaacs: what do you want to do with this package?
[02:15] isaacs: publish it?  install it?
[02:15] atmos: how do i test it ?
[02:15] atmos: both
[02:15] isaacs: npm install
[02:15] isaacs: make sure that works
[02:15] isaacs: does it have a test script?
[02:16] atmos: nah, it has tests but you need to export environmental variables
[02:16] atmos: it has an executable though so i can try that
[02:16] isaacs: atmos: you can write your test as a shell script, and just set the envs there.
[02:16] isaacs: atmos: FOO=bar node my-script.js
[02:16] isaacs: atmos: then process.env.FOO === "bar" in my-script.js

[02:17] Sebmaster: isaacs: does npm offer a nice way of executing tests?
[02:17] johnnywengluu: how do i make expressjs bound to my public ip?
[02:17] jotaru: Can someone help me understand why mongo closes my connection after connecting to it and attempting to write something to it ;x?
[02:17] isaacs: anyway, if you set some command in { "scripts" : { "test" : "./run-my-tests.sh" } } then it'll do that when you do `npm test` in the dir, or `npm test <name>` from anywhere if it's installed.
[02:17] tjholowaychuk: johnnywengluu: listen() takes the same arguments as http.Server#listen()
[02:17] isaacs: Sebmaster: ^
[02:18] Sebmaster: isaacs: Thanks, Sounds good
[02:18] jotaru: (I was able to do it with memcahce, however I presume these servers might be more complex to talk to.)

[02:21] atmos: thanks isaacs
[02:21] Sebmaster: piscisaureus: Even better, if the bugs fix each other
[02:22] johnnywengluu: tjholowaychuk: thanks it worked
[02:22] isaacs: atmos: :D
[02:22] piscisaureus: erm, yah but then you won't run into :-)
[02:22] Sebmaster: piscisaureus: Nah, i meant they fix each other just in edge cases :/
[02:23] piscisaureus: yeah
[02:23] piscisaureus: Sebmaster: actually, that was what happened when the cygwin build didn't work on the 0.3 branch
[02:23] Sebmaster: huh?
[02:23] piscisaureus: erm well, it was the reason that it actually sometimes did work
[02:23] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: any reason why in 0.4.0 when a server says its listening, then a request is issued right away I still get ECONNREFUSED ?
[02:23] tjholowaychuk: all sorts of things that were fine in 0.2.6 are breaking now
[02:24] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: hot sure
[02:24] isaacs: *not sure
[02:24] tjholowaychuk: I even had to change a setTimeout() in a test from 200ms to 1500ms for it to work haha
[02:24] Sebmaster: piscisaureus: Which bugs?
[02:24] tjholowaychuk: breakkkkkage
[02:24] piscisaureus: Sebmaster: v8 internally used the wrong calling convention when it optimized api calls
[02:24] piscisaureus: e.g. calls into c++ space
[02:25] johnnywengluu: tjholowaychuk: hmm wait it didnt work
[02:25] piscisaureus: but when the first guy did the cygwin port he ripped out so many random stuff that v8 wouldn't attempt to optimize any more
[02:25] johnnywengluu: app.listen(4000); will bind to my public ip too?
[02:25] pkrumins: node4 guys!

[02:28] SubStack: you don't make friends with salad
[02:28] piscisaureus: well if you add enough sugar
[02:29] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: that was seriously how much I had to change it to work haha https://github.com/visionmedia/expresso/commit/2c8759f147831c5ab018f764e433748f632702fc
[02:29] tjholowaychuk: something got muuuch slower

[02:30] skm has joined the channel
[02:30] piscisaureus: tjholowaychuk: where are these perf regressions? http?
[02:30] tjholowaychuk: piscisaureus: hello world was about 4000rps slower than 0.2.6 on my machine
[02:31] tjholowaychuk: and all my tests that are http heavy are 10x slower
[02:31] hobodave has joined the channel
[02:31] piscisaureus: so probably it's http ... hmm
[02:31] johnnywengluu: tjholowaychuk: sorry but im noob at networking .. what does hostname mean and what should I type in
[02:31] Ratty_: :/
[02:32] perlmonkey2: Why would it be slowed down this much?  Doesn't 'stable' mean well tested?
[02:32] tjholowaychuk: piscisaureus: and i get the listening event, then do some requests against it and get ECONNREFUSED haha
[02:32] tjholowaychuk: ill try and get a stand-alone reproduction
[02:32] tjholowaychuk: basically everything ive tried so far doesnt work
[02:33] piscisaureus: ouch
[02:33] tjholowaychuk: ACTION was stoked to get going on 0.4.0 :(
[02:33] Sebmaster: isaacs: is there a command line parameter for npm, to change the name of node-executeable?
[02:33] isaacs: Sebmaster: no
[02:33] Sebmaster: hmm
[02:33] isaacs: Sebmaster: that would be very difficult to do in a robust wa.
[02:33] isaacs: *way
[02:34] isaacs: node should be named "node"
[02:34] slickplaid: ls
[02:34] piscisaureus: tjholowaychuk: so there's also problems with raw sockets?
[02:34] piscisaureus: I don't think much has changed
[02:34] techwraith has joined the channel
[02:34] Sebmaster: it is actually named node, but it has a prefix
[02:34] tjholowaychuk: piscisaureus: im just writing a small example, ill see if it fails
[02:34] piscisaureus: ok
[02:34] isaacs: Sebmaster: any reason why you can't put it in your PATH?
[02:35] isaacs: Sebmaster: npm uses whichever node it's started with, and sets up executables to be run with `/usr/bin/env node`
[02:35] isaacs: i gotta run
[02:35] Sebmaster: isaacs: Thansk
[02:35] piscisaureus: don;t slip
[02:35] Sebmaster: isaacs: PATH sounds good :p
[02:35] isaacs: Sebmaster: kewl
[02:36] johnnywengluu: if i type in a port name : server.listen(4000) doesnt that mean that it will listen on 4000 on my 127.0.0.1?
[02:37] piscisaureus: yeah
[02:37] piscisaureus: that's what it means
[02:37] xandrews has joined the channel
[02:37] johnnywengluu: i have a router that is forwarding incoming requests to port 4000 to my computer where i have the above run
[02:37] johnnywengluu: but i get nothing
[02:38] johnnywengluu: i dont know what is wrong
[02:38] piscisaureus: can you access it at localhost:4000 on the computer itself
[02:38] johnnywengluu: yeah
[02:39] piscisaureus: well then apparently it listens on 127.0.0.1 :-)
[02:39] piscisaureus: firewall?
[02:39] tjholowaychuk: piscisaureus: stand-alone it seems fine, good to know haha
[02:39] tjholowaychuk: fewf
[02:39] jakehow has joined the channel
[02:39] piscisaureus: ok
[02:39] piscisaureus: maybe not
[02:39] piscisaureus: harder to track down the bug
[02:39] tjholowaychuk: i prefer it to be connect's fault
[02:39] tjholowaychuk: haha
[02:40] piscisaureus: yeah, me too :-)
[02:40] johnnywengluu: piscisaureus: i just have the time capsule router
[02:40] piscisaureus: i have no experience with those
[02:40] johnnywengluu: piscisaureus: how do I make it listen on the public ip?
[02:40] piscisaureus: but you may be running a firewall on the machine that node runs on?
[02:40] piscisaureus: server.listen(4000) should listen on any ip
[02:41] kris_ has joined the channel
[02:41] piscisaureus: otherwise server.listen(4000, "the.public.i.p")
[02:41] johnnywengluu: weird..i have forwarded all incoming for port 4000 to 4000 on my computer
[02:41] tjholowaychuk: piscisaureus: nvm it was some old test crap connect was doing
[02:41] tjholowaychuk: ACTION rages for nothing
[02:41] drudge: woo
[02:41] mscdex: or use 0.0.0.0 for all addresses
[02:41] tjholowaychuk: back to progress
[02:42] perlmonkey2: yay, express is magically fixed :D
[02:42] piscisaureus: tjholowaychuk: phew. I would have been surprised if node really got much slower without ab noticing
[02:42] tjholowaychuk: piscisaureus: the ab slowness was still just node
[02:42] tjholowaychuk: but my tests breaking was just old connect stuff
[02:42] piscisaureus: yeah but ab is okay now right?
[02:42] tjholowaychuk: still the same
[02:42] piscisaureus: oh tj, you know who runs ab?
[02:42] tjholowaychuk: about 4k slower
[02:43] tjholowaychuk: what?

[02:49] NickP: tjholowaychuk: will you be maintaining connect under visionmedia rather than senchalabs? Noticed your fork
[02:49] jonaslund: mainly things just working.. networking,etc without having to dive into man pages and mucking about with wpa-supplicant manually,etc
[02:49] tjholowaychuk: NickP: sure will
[02:49] tjholowaychuk: once 1.0 is out that is
[02:49] jonaslund: and preferably having power-management stuff working aswell
[02:49] tjholowaychuk: NickP: it was getting annoying, i never get notifictions for the sencha stuff
[02:49] jonaslund: and preferably a sane UI and non-ancient packages if possible
[02:50] piscisaureus: I just use ubuntu when I need to use linux
[02:51] piscisaureus: I'm sure now hell breaks loose and ppl will tell me NOOO fedora/debian/foobarware
[02:51] johnnywengluu: i didnt know that a browser could redirect to a POST url
[02:51] piscisaureus: etc.etc. 
[02:51] NickP: tjholowaychuk: What kind of notifications? I can probably get it turned on
[02:51] tjholowaychuk: NickP: just github notifications in general
[02:52] tjholowaychuk: i go to the issues sometimes and there are like 10 more that dont show up in my notifications
[02:52] tjholowaychuk: and frankly they have done nothing for the project at all in soooooooo long
[02:52] tjholowaychuk: im the only one who has touched it
[02:52] tjholowaychuk: and they have that stupid CLA
[02:52] tjholowaychuk: so fuck it

[02:55] piscisaureus: jonaslund: ubuntu was pretty much a warm bath for a linux noob. Last time I tried before was SuSe (does that even exist still) but way too much time to learn.
[02:55] jonaslund: hmm ok
[02:55] piscisaureus: (despite I really don't like the concept of a *brown* gui)
[02:55] jonaslund: i only tried ubuntu with a desktop for my ps3 but it felt a bit underwhelming
[02:55] jonaslund: oh and it was x-ubuntu
[02:56] piscisaureus: jonaslund: well I think I am the worst advisor here

[03:04] jonaslund: or just put in XP to get things working
[03:05] jonaslund: (it's a 6 years old laptop with a bit odd hardware)
[03:05] jonaslund: First time i tried running X i ended up producing a patch for Xwindows.. and just my luck it was during the Xfree/Xorg split
[03:05] Sebmaster: :/ i guess i got another bug report for isaacs...
[03:05] arpegius has joined the channel
[03:05] jonaslund: took over a year for that patch to get into Xorg
[03:06] Sebmaster: kinda long reaction time^^
[03:06] jonaslund: then it's been so-and-so with wifi
[03:06] jonaslund: Xfree86 was much quicker at the time
[03:06] jonaslund: on the other hand they didn't clean up the patch in Xfree but did so with Xorg
[03:07] jonaslund: (It wasn't 100% proper patch by spec but good enough to work.. the problem was that the driver didn't follow the spec at all)
[03:07] jonaslund: ohwell

[04:48] fission6: i am getting an error to the console like "10 Feb 23:34:37 - The onerror handler" is that from something specific ?
[04:48] JimBastard: SubStack: so use that instead of gitolite or gitosis?

[04:53] marcello3d: ok well then, guess chrome/safari are bugged out :)
[04:54] mscdex: fission6: grepping the source shows an 'onerror' handler in tls.js
[04:54] fission6: hmmm well i mean it could be coming from another module i am using 3rd party
[04:55] tfe_: is there another channel for npm questions, or can I ask hee?

[04:58] johnnywengluu: where can i read about how to use app.use(express.session()); ?
[04:58] johnnywengluu: i have to set a secret value it says
[04:59] tjholowaychuk: johnnywengluu: express.session({ secret: 'whatever' })
[04:59] johnnywengluu: tjholowaychuk: is there an API doc?
[04:59] tjholowaychuk: in the source yeah
[04:59] tjholowaychuk: :)
[04:59] tjholowaychuk: docs will come with my rewrite of connect
[04:59] softdrink1 has joined the channel
[04:59] tjholowaychuk: updated / less shitty docs that is

[05:01] amerine has joined the channel
[05:02] dthompson has joined the channel
[05:03] SubStack: why does express's session module need a secret?
[05:04] aurynn: Encryption
[05:04] johnnywengluu: i dont get how to use it http://senchalabs.github.com/connect/session.html
[05:04] SubStack: yes but
[05:04] aurynn: it's a salt value
[05:04] razvandimescu has joined the channel
[05:04] SubStack: why do you need a salt to do sessions?
[05:04] johnnywengluu: how do i create a session ?
[05:05] aurynn: So that the cookie stores can't be decrypted?
[05:05] SubStack: um what
[05:05] aurynn: You can store stuff in the cookie in base64
[05:05] SubStack: in the database?
[05:05] aurynn: if you like
[05:05] SubStack: client side?
[05:05] SubStack: that seems a silly way to do it
[05:05] aurynn: PArt of a session involves the client holding a bit of data
[05:05] aurynn: I'd rather not have the client be able to manipulate that data at all
[05:05] SubStack: in sesame I just generate a random id and associate that with data on the server side
[05:05] lukegalea_ has joined the channel
[05:06] fission6: mscdex: you there?
[05:06] mscdex: fission6: kinda
[05:06] aurynn: johnnywengluu, what's complex about it?
[05:07] aurynn: It's a middleware, you plug it in above your app and it shows up in the request
[05:07] johnnywengluu: aurynn: i just dont get how to create a session
[05:07] johnnywengluu: i have these lines: app.use(express.cookieDecoder());  app.use(express.session({secret: "123"}));
[05:07] fission6: nm i think i may be on to something
[05:07] aurynn: Okay..
[05:07] johnnywengluu: but then how do i create a session?
[05:07] SubStack: johnnywengluu: it's a bit messed up
[05:07] aurynn: It's created automatically by a request
[05:08] SubStack: johnnywengluu: that's why I wrote sesame! http://substack.net/posts/f5680b/Sesame-sessions 
[05:08] SubStack: aurynn: if only it were so simple!
[05:08] johnnywengluu: aurynn: so how do i set session info?
[05:08] aurynn: johnnywengluu, req.session['key name here'] = whatever;
[05:09] aurynn: in your route methods
[05:09] aurynn: well, .get and .set
[05:09] SubStack: there's all of this .regenerate/.generate noise in connect's session lib
[05:10] SubStack: and unless tj fixed it recently you have to .generate() each session explicitly
[05:10] aurynn: I've never had to generate sessions explicitly..
[05:10] SubStack: oh?
[05:11] SubStack: are you using a data store too for persistent sessions?
[05:11] aurynn: I'm using MemoryStore
[05:11] aurynn: though I won't discount that I'm Doin' It Rong
[05:11] SubStack: well if it works then you must be doing something right
[05:14] mjijackson has joined the channel
[05:15] aurynn: Yeah, seems to work for me
[05:15] hosh_work has joined the channel
[05:15] SubStack: just whipped up a quick app and it works with the in-memory store
[05:16] SubStack: except I don't understand
[05:16] SubStack: it demands a secret, presumably to store info in the cookie
[05:16] johnnywengluu: aurynn: TypeError: Cannot set property 'token' of undefined
[05:16] SubStack: but then when you restart it all the data goes away
[05:16] johnnywengluu: req.session["token"] = token;
[05:16] SubStack: doesn't make sense!
[05:16] johnnywengluu: it says that "session" is not defined in "req"
[05:16] aurynn: SubStack, a memorystore throws the data away on shutdown?
[05:16] SubStack: aurynn: seems so
[05:17] SubStack: https://gist.github.com/821960 
[05:17] marcello3d: are there any stateless web frameworks built on node.js?
[05:17] marcello3d: stateless-focused, that is
[05:18] aurynn: Any one that you don't plug a session store into, really
[05:18] SubStack: why would you go out of your way to get a stateless one?
[05:18] WRA: marcello: all of them?
[05:18] marcello3d: is there a good list or discussion of various node frameworks?
[05:18] marcello3d: substack: scalability
[05:18] aurynn: given a session store is optional..
[05:19] WRA: look, the china man is not the issue.
[05:19] johnnywengluu: anyone knows why i get "undefined" in req.session: http://pastie.org/1551559
[05:19] WRA: - The big Lebowski
[05:20] WRA: I think it applies here marcello

[05:20] aurynn: marcello3d, what scaling issue are you seeing?
[05:21] chrischris has joined the channel
[05:21] SubStack: johnnywengluu: really puzzling
[05:21] marcello3d: not an issue, just wondering what people use...perhaps I'm asking the wrong questions :)
[05:21] marcello3d: it's harder to scale stateful servers
[05:21] SubStack: johnnywengluu: npm install sesame :D
[05:22] WRA: depends on the service
[05:22] WRA: anyhow, we're just giving you shit marcello, there are a bunch out there
[05:22] johnnywengluu: SubStack: haha if i cant get it to work in 2 days!
[05:22] WRA: have you taken a look at http?
[05:22] SubStack: johnnywengluu: check this out too https://github.com/substack/node-sesame/blob/master/examples/memory-express.js
[05:23] SubStack: sessions should not be this much work
[05:23] marcello3d: someone made a framework called http?
[05:23] marcello3d: or you mean the built-in module?
[05:23] WRA: its a pretty bad ass web server
[05:23] WRA: ;)
[05:23] SubStack: marcello3d: http is in core
[05:23] marcello3d: yea, I got that far ;)
[05:23] WRA: the others are just convience built on top of that
[05:23] marcello3d: yea, that's what I gathered
[05:24] marcello3d: what do you guys use?
[05:24] marcello3d: if any
[05:24] SubStack: here, I'll whip up an express example app-style
[05:24] WRA: express is super popular
[05:24] SubStack: I really do like express the connect way better though
[05:24] lukegalea_ has joined the channel
[05:24] WRA: I've seen it in alot of programs
[05:24] SubStack: less boilerplate
[05:25] WRA: is there a decent CMS yet?
[05:25] marcello3d: I browsed through express' site a bit

[05:26] SubStack: yay that was easy
[05:26] hosh_work_ has joined the channel
[05:26] WRA: yeah, nothign on the wiki about any CMS
[05:26] WRA: I will keep my LAMP+Drupal website for now ;)
[05:27] andrewfff has joined the channel
[05:27] Lorentz: I'm soooorta designing one, but it's more a store management thing than a full cms
[05:27] SubStack: johnnywengluu: https://github.com/substack/node-sesame/blob/master/examples/memory-express-app.js 
[05:27] WRA: haha yeah, I sorta have one too but its more a generic game server than a cms
[05:27] SubStack: just hacked that up!
[05:27] SamuraiJack has joined the channel
[05:27] SubStack: SamuraiJack: I know you from npmtop!
[05:28] WRA: but you could use it as a cms... since the game objects can surface web pages

[05:28] SamuraiJack: SubStack: hey, cool :)
[05:28] MikhX has joined the channel
[05:28] WRA: CMS or game server framework ?
[05:28] johnnywengluu: SubStack: but that should work with Express too
[05:28] AAA_awright: Idk what counts as a CMS but it exposes statements made about resources as HTML pages
[05:28] johnnywengluu: req.session 
[05:28] WRA: haha\
[05:29] marcello3d: so connect wraps http
[05:29] WRA: I like how we all offer web pages for our apps since its so damn easy to
[05:29] marcello3d: to add stuff
[05:29] marcello3d: and express wraps connext to add routing and views?
[05:29] marcello3d: *connect
[05:29] AAA_awright: WRA: I thought Drupal had a somewhat decent data model but I realized it's no good after all, had to un-learn how to do things to do them better
[05:30] WRA: I'm not a fan but it works and is proven
[05:30] WRA: like I wouldn't dare use a production node.js CMS
[05:30] WRA: maybe in another year ;)
[05:30] AAA_awright: Which part production?
[05:31] SamuraiJack: I guess I already crossed tholowachuk (might be misspelling the name), but some distros are on early stage - w/o docs
[05:31] WRA: as in live/something I have to support for my job ;)
[05:31] AAA_awright: WRA: That's the last consern, PHP at least gracefully kills your server, a bad Node.js process will go *really* bad
[05:31] WRA: that provided some vital service
[05:31] WRA: yeah
[05:31] AAA_awright: Even if it is more efficent when it does work
[05:31] AAA_awright: Being threadless
[05:31] SubStack: johnnywengluu: yes except that it doesn't!
[05:31] WRA: a bad node.js server could also do some terrible security things ;)
[05:32] WRA: if you aren't running it in a sandbox
[05:32] AAA_awright: But that's no different for any Node.js app so...
[05:32] Prometheus: speaking of which, how do you handle things like that? =)
[05:32] Prometheus: how do you usually*
[05:32] Prometheus: chroot or something?
[05:32] WRA: yeah, just something to be mindful of new technology

[05:33] Prometheus: ChrisPartridge: what kind of a container? :)
[05:33] Prometheus: WRA: that works I suppose :)

[05:33] Lorentz: chroot, jail, run it as a harmless user, etc
[05:33] ChrisPartridge: Prometheus: I use lxc
[05:33] WRA: so they can go hog wild 
[05:33] marcello3d: wra: what are you running?

[06:26] Ratty_: Damn troll 2. They're not even trolls, they're goblins.
[06:26] iszak: tbh I don't really mind debian, only problem is lack of updates - but thats fair enough, I mean stability is one of it's aim
[06:26] iszak: in fact I'm using Ubuntu on my production server.
[06:27] Lorentz: iszak: What you can do is either add backports to your sources.list, or wait until testing freeze and then start using that.
[06:27] slickplaid: yeah i sometimes prefer to use ubuntu over debian for that specific fact
[06:27] Lorentz: It's not too unstable if you do that, since testing still is somewhat filtered.
[06:27] iszak: Lorentz, back ports aren't the same.
[06:27] Ratty_: Ubuntu only do an LTS release every 2 years too.
[06:27] iszak: Lorentz, they don't include new features, only fixes.
[06:28] Lorentz: iszak: Didn't mention new features, so
[06:28] Lorentz: Just updates
[06:28] iszak: well that's what I want.
[06:28] iszak: features.
[06:28] iszak: isn't that why anyone upgrade minor versions, major versions?
[06:29] Lorentz: Generally if I really really really want a specific feature, I can compile it myself and made a deb out of it or something.

[07:15] johnnywengluu: instead of having app.get(), app.put(), app.del() and app.post() with all the same function body

[07:17] Aria: Functions are values too. You can set the references how you like.
[07:17] johnnywengluu: i still need them to be separate for other handlers
[07:17] Aria: Ah. I don't know express quite well enough, but I think you can set it just for that one handler with something like handler.get = handler.post = function() { ..... }
[07:18] johnnywengluu: ok 
[07:19] johnnywengluu: i declared a function that i use in all 4 methods
[07:19] johnnywengluu: by passing that function in as argument .. keeping it DRY .. works too i guess

[10:18] adambeynon has joined the channel
[10:20] lukes: adulteratedjedi: awesome. how long did it take to get accepted to joyent?

[10:22] lukes: heroku were also running a beta right? did they kill that?
[10:23] jimt has joined the channel
[10:23] adulteratedjedi: lukes: no probs :-) killer feature of nodester at the moment is their cli, which is very heroku-esque. Although wouldn't be too hard to convert it to joyent, which I may experiment with
[10:24] adulteratedjedi: heroku are still running the node beta for old beta customers, just not accepting new ones any more
[10:25] m64253_ has joined the channel
[10:25] lukes: cool. i never used heroku or anything like that. someone was telling me that it's basically a case of 'git push' and then deployments just magically happen.

[10:26] chapel: started out using a similar name to nodejitsu
[10:27] adulteratedjedi: lukes: yeah its the same, heroku is obviously more feature-full
[10:27] chapel: and using parts of nodejitsu's open sourced code
[10:27] adulteratedjedi: lukes: joyent is just a git push as well ;-)
[10:27] chapel: then they got their db hacked
[10:27] lukes: adulteratedjedi: sweet
[10:27] lukes: chapel: nodester did? doh.
[10:27] chapel: yeah
[10:27] adulteratedjedi: lukes: but as I say nodester has a cli, so I can issue a command to install an npm package, instead of having to SSH in
[10:28] konobi: no.de also does service management, restart on push, etc.
[10:28] konobi: ssh++
[10:28] v8bot:  konobi has given a beer to ssh. ssh now has 1 beers.
[10:28] lukes: :)
[10:28] chapel: the most worrysome thing about it is that it seems so rushed
[10:29] lukes: i would like to go eith joyent i think, just a case of getting to the front of the queue in time.
[10:29] konobi: and websockets and long polling on no.de _just_ works
[10:29] lukes: s/eith/with/
[10:29] chapel: as someone said, node hosting is the new hello world
[10:30] chapel: no.de has joyent, ie ryah and konobi
[10:30] lukes: bonus
[10:30] chapel: nodejitsu has JimBastard (marak) tmpvar indexzero around as well
[10:30] chapel: those are the only two hosting platforms with active members on irc
[10:30] chapel: and the mailing list
[10:31] adulteratedjedi: yeah i'm liking joyent so far, just seeing if I can upgrade node konobi?

[10:40] Jaye: node.js = short attention span? :P
[10:40] tanepiper: but i totally agree with you on 2,4,6,8 and 9
[10:40] JimBastard: i learned from zed that you say inflammatory stuff at the top, then ease into it at the bottom. 
[10:40] tanepiper: i know someone working on 2
[10:40] adulteratedjedi: JimBastard: they will be on github yes, still in the early planning stages so not much there. the IM/Chat Application is at adulteratedjedi/palaver .. reminds me I need to push to it though
[10:41] JimBastard: adulteratedjedi: ajaxim is pretty sweet, why build another one?
[10:41] tanepiper: and 6 would be the killer to bring people in.  8 could totally be done as a couchapp with nodejs backend
[10:41] JimBastard: my only regret is not having 5 developers under my employee
[10:41] JimBastard: does anyone wanna cut us a check for 400k?
[10:41] JimBastard: :-D
[10:42] qFox: does it go directly to the developer?
[10:42] tanepiper: JimBastard: money or lack of skilled developers?
[10:42] JimBastard: money
[10:42] JimBastard: we are trying to secure some of it

[10:47] tanepiper: adulteratedjedi: yea, this stuff should be easy (in functionality, not time) to do in nodejs

[10:47] clarkfischer: oh wow
[10:47] clarkfischer: i wrote a facebook-style chat app in node
[10:47] adulteratedjedi: tanepiper: I agree
[10:47] tanepiper: socket-based CMS's, integrated javascript-based editors, etc
[10:48] clarkfischer: it's not deployable in one line, though.
[10:48] jonaslund: tanepiper: why socket based ?
[10:48] jonaslund: hmmm

[10:49] adulteratedjedi: tanepiper: create a github repo and lets get started :-p lol

[10:51] adulteratedjedi: jonaslund: and that is why you have a "CMS" .. so the client can write the text..
[10:51] jonaslund: adulteratedjedi: for me it fits with my theme that if you are doing non-cms applications you often need a CMS to handle alot of "soft" data
[10:51] JimBastard: clarkfischer: if you building a javascript based im , if its not one js file requirable, its prob built wrong
[10:52] clarkfischer: it is
[10:52] Jaye: substack: i am using browserify on a new project, in its current state it is already very very useful, saves a lot of fiddling
[10:52] JimBastard: :p
[10:52] clarkfischer: wellt
[10:52] JimBastard: i had to build one in php
[10:52] JimBastard: its terrible
[10:52] SubStack: tanepiper: yes, considering every piece of our code uses dnode
[10:52] clarkfischer: the one i wrote isn't Open Source
[10:52] JimBastard: and still in production
[10:52] clarkfischer: and it depends upon Drupal
[10:52] SubStack: Jaye: awesome!
[10:52] clarkfischer: (for a client *rolls eyes*)
[10:53] jonaslund: SubStack: cool product
[10:53] SubStack: Jaye: which feature do you want to see land next? recursive dependency fetching? a nice non-middleware way to bundle source?
[10:53] jonaslund: personally i have a pc and a mac so i don't think it's that useful for me
[10:54] Jaye: probably a non-middleware way to deploy so i can run it through a compressor or what have you
[10:54] fly-away has joined the channel
[10:54] bartt has joined the channel
[10:54] SubStack: ah yeah makes sense
[10:55] SubStack: also perhaps I can have a compressor option
[10:55] jonaslund: SubStack: gonna support iOS browsers and/or Android ?
[10:56] Jaye: it wasnt too hard to put uglifyjs into it, but it uglify breaks some of my code, and connect didnt like an async call to yui before returning the handler
[10:56] SubStack: that's the plan
[10:56] SubStack: android is easier so we'll have that sooner
[10:56] jonaslund: hmm
[10:56] jonaslund: SubStack: looked at phonegap ? it's an "browser-embedding-framework" for webapps on phones
[10:57] floby has joined the channel
[10:57] SubStack: yes I'm familiar
[10:57] jonaslund: cool
[10:57] konobi: jonaslund: phonegap's pretty fun
[10:57] torvalamo has joined the channel
[10:57] jonaslund: yeah obj-C is a bit of a stepping stone
[10:57] SubStack: oh wait this is something else
[10:57] tanepiper: phonegap looks like it has this new awesome online build system
[10:57] floby has left the channel
[10:57] konobi: yup
[10:57] tanepiper: basically, write your app, upload, it'll build and deploy
[10:58] konobi: build.phonegap.com
[10:58] jonaslund: SubStack: it's opensource so you can prolly nick a bit of the source for the initial browser embedding
[10:58] tanepiper: konobi: yea, i've signed up but waiting to hear back

[10:59] tanepiper: wait, is phonegap obj-j or plain js?

[11:01] konobi: tanepiper: it's _just_ JS for development space
[11:02] konobi: the code to get you a sane browser/JS environment is written in a bunch of things depending on the platform you're aiming for
[11:02] tanepiper: SubStack: you're insane you know that ;)  ssh-servers in nodejs indeed!
[11:02] bartt has joined the channel

[11:14] kelt: u can see that its 'loading'
[11:14] kelt: im using 0.4 
[11:16] JimBastard: kelt: add an error handler for the request
[11:16] JimBastard: its prob bombing out
[11:19] chapel: well
[11:19] chapel: does the scope of where a function is defined or called matter to what variables it uses?
[11:19] chapel: since the server has a res object
[11:19] kristsk has joined the channel
[11:19] chapel: and the client has a res object
[11:19] JimBastard: i think the scope is OK, not good pratice
[11:19] JimBastard: but it looks ok
[11:19] chapel: he defines the function in the server
[11:20] chapel: but calls it in the client
[11:20] chapel: I know he wants to use the servers res
[11:20] chapel: but he might need to pass it

[11:22] bartt has joined the channel
[11:23] JimBastard: kelt: did you add an error handler to the request?
[11:23] kelt: no ive decided to downgrade to 0.3.6
[11:24] JimBastard: you should be trapping errors on requests that interact with third party services
[11:24] JimBastard: regardless
[11:24] bartt has joined the channel
[11:25] chapel: yep, and dropping to 0.3.6 isn't going to help, you will need to move to 0.4.0 anyways
[11:25] beawesomeinstead has joined the channel
[11:26] kelt: ill go to 0.3.6 and when 1.0 comes out ill upgrade
[11:26] kelt: this guy changes the api to much
[11:26] Jaye: 0.4.0 is "stable
[11:26] springify has joined the channel
[11:26] Jaye: *"stable", 0.3 isnt
[11:26] Jaye: or wasnt
[11:27] kelt: but im sure that for 0.4.5 there will be lots of new api changes
[11:27] kelt: it worked fine
[11:28] chapel: kelt, in 0.4.x there wont be any api changes
[11:28] chapel: or there shouldn't be
[11:28] chapel: and kelt, if you are gonna wait until 1.0 to upgrade, expect waiting a year or more

[11:50] bartt has joined the channel
[11:50] bartt1 has joined the channel
[11:51] mscdex: yeah but i noticed an issue with cygwin with networking so i'm trying to get the mingw build working to see if it's actually a cygwin problem or related to virtualbox or something else
[11:51] ukev has joined the channel
[11:52] Sebmaster: i think cygwin is like a billion times slower with networking stuff than a real system...
[11:52] Sebmaster: at least id like to think so
[11:53] Sebmaster: since im getting really bad results when i call send many times and wait for a result
[11:53] mscdex: well, it's not bad all the time, just certain situations i think

[11:54] Sebmaster: as soon as i tested this network part on a native linux machine and it works, ill happilly continue to use cygwin
[11:54] mscdex: specifically i'm using node_pcap and i get results instantly when sniffing traffic originating from the local machine, but listening for incoming traffic from say the internet, it takes a full minute for the traffic to become available it seems
[11:55] sriley has joined the channel

[11:58] jonaslund: or more of a nat
[11:58] jonaslund: could do normal routing with it aswell i think
[11:58] mscdex: yeah, so i'm not sure what the deal is
[11:58] mscdex: :\
[11:58] jonaslund: basically the program sat upon a couple of network interfaces and acted as it's own host
[11:58] mscdex: or maybe it's just nt4
[11:58] bartt has joined the channel
[11:58] mscdex: heh
[11:59] jonaslund: so the windows network IF that was facing the net had no protocols configured
[11:59] bartt1 has joined the channel
[11:59] jonaslund: and then the machine had 2 ip's facing inwards (one from the app and one from windows itself)
[11:59] jonaslund: it was a funny excercise

[11:59] jonaslund: why are you running NT4? :)
[12:00] jonaslund: i have only bad experiences.. although i later found out that the hardware on that machine was dodgy

[14:42] mxp: if your server supports u can take it higher

[14:43] stagas: mxp: cool. one notice only, the Reston object should be reston with a lowercase. instead make the file constructor like reston.File so you can tell what needs a 'new' or not

[15:39] mxp: :P
[15:39] keeto: cool.
[15:39] sooli: mxp: here my code : http://pastie.org/1553048 only one get seems to work
[15:39] sooli: weird
[15:39] sooli: it display me only MSG(iPad) or only MSG(google)
[15:41] mxp: sooli lemme see 
[15:41] mxp: wats ur node version sooli?
[15:42] sooli: does I have to do Reston = require ... and Reston2 = require ? 
[15:42] sooli: 0.2.6
[15:42] sooli: let me install 0.4
[15:42] mxp: sooli no no  every Reston.get is new instance
[15:42] mxp: remember the fact that NodeJS is single threaded
[15:44] Aikar: what does single threaded have to do with instances
[15:44] mxp: Aikar nothing really should work
[15:44] namelessnotion_ has joined the channel
[15:45] pifantastic has joined the channel
[15:45] Aikar: mxp: lib looks nice, did you figure out how to get it on npm? just type npm publish inside of the folder on your end and itll be uploaded to npm
[15:45] Aikar: then you can 'npm install reston'
[15:46] sooli: that's will be nice :)
[15:46] broofa has joined the channel
[15:46] Aikar: youll need to regisiter an account with npm first

[15:46] mxp: Aikar:  did that
[15:46] mxp: Aikar: any limit on number of requests to same url by node?
[15:47] mxp: like in browser's XHR?
[15:47] Aikar: mxp: are you using the new http.request/get in node?
[15:47] mxp: yep
[15:47] Aikar: if so, that uses its own agent which will maintain a few connections to server
[15:48] Aikar: should be no 'limit'
[15:48] mxp:  var cl = http.createClient( port || 80, hostname);     var req = cl.request( method, (pathname || '/') + (query_string || ''), headers || {});
[15:48] astoon has joined the channel

[15:49] mxp: yep works on 0.4.0 as well
[15:49] sooli: same behavior with node 0.4
[15:49] Aikar: theres a new http.request interface in .3.6+ (.4 is now the stable branch), should use that
[15:50] zachsmith has joined the channel
[15:50] sooli: only one req is working
[15:50] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[15:50] mxp: Aikar:  so .2.x is limited?
[15:50] lukegalea_ has joined the channel
[15:50] Aikar: i dunno what you mean limited, but i dunno if the createClient method will stay around. i think ry would want people to use the new http.request method
[15:51] ceej has joined the channel
[15:51] mxp: sooli if its a .2.x limitation i would be pushing out fix in no time
[15:51] sooli: ok finaly i did help with my tests :)

[19:22] piscisaureus: umm, dunno, sunday ?
[19:22] spaceinvader: and how come npm says don't run as root, yet you have to run it under sudo to install anything?
[19:22] piscisaureus: why?
[19:23] tiemonster has joined the channel
[19:23] tiemonster: piscisaureus: so can I, apparently
[19:23] piscisaureus: what's the matter?
[19:23] heavysixer has joined the channel
[19:24] jchris has joined the channel
[19:24] tiemonster: piscisaureus: anyways, I wanted to talk to you about setenv
[19:24] lukegalea_ has joined the channel
[19:25] piscisaureus: what's the problem with it?
[19:25] tiemonster: you said you wanted us to use the unicode version - SetEnvironmentVariableW
[19:25] piscisaureus: yeah
[19:25] tiemonster: problem being, the key is passed to the EnvSetter as a char*, not a char_w* or WCHAR*
[19:25] Aikar: spaceinvader: because npm can run commands on your PC that the package owner specifies, so running as root if you installed a malicious package, it could run commands as root. but newer npm is going to fix that by dropping privs
[19:26] piscisaureus: the key huh
[19:26] tiemonster: so should we be converting the bytecode into a wide char and then setting?
[19:26] piscisaureus: let me check that
[19:26] tiemonster: well, the value is the same deal
[19:26] piscisaureus: could do that
[19:26] tiemonster: everything works fine with SetEnvironmentVariable because it uses char*
[19:27] piscisaureus: but I guess you can get wchars straight from v8
[19:27] Aikar: spaceinvader: the dcommands portion is for binary modules, it has to run the compile script. so a malicious person could put rm -rf / into the build script, publish, and when you install the module using root, bam your files are gone
[19:27] hunterloftis: Anybody else getting errors after pulling/installing the latest npm? (cannot find module'constants')
[19:27] matyr has joined the channel
[19:28] piscisaureus: tiemonster:
[19:28] piscisaureus: it's much easier
[19:28] piscisaureus: on windows use "String::Value key(property);"
[19:28] tiemonster: I'll try that
[19:28] piscisaureus: Notice the Utf8 portion gone
[19:28] tiemonster: piscisaureus: also, when I generate a patch file, it included the entire history. Is there a way to create a patch file with just our changes?
[19:28] piscisaureus: not directly
[19:29] piscisaureus: you'd need to rebase and squash everything
[19:29] tiemonster: OK. I'll make another fork, put our changes there, and then generate a patch file
[19:29] piscisaureus: tiemonster: first you need to rebase on top of ryah's master
[19:30] piscisaureus: because you have merged with it
[19:30] piscisaureus: so you do git rebase origin/master

[20:10] devdazed: i know of eval, but i need to be safe about it
[20:10] tjholowaychuk: devdazed: foo.bar.baz
[20:10] ceej: anyone use connect-redis ?
[20:10] tjholowaychuk: lol
[20:10] tjholowaychuk: its a property
[20:10] tjholowaychuk: ceej: broken? what redis-server --version ?
[20:10] devdazed: tjholowaychuk: but i get a string of 'foo.bar.baz'
[20:10] tjholowaychuk: has to be above 1.3.(10?)
[20:10] ceej: tjholowaychuk:  hey :)
[20:10] devdazed: i know i can do eval('foo.bar.baz')
[20:10] tjholowaychuk: devdazed: split on '.' and walk it
[20:11] wadey: devdazed: split the string, then it is foo['bar']['baz']
[20:11] devdazed: but I dont always know the string coming in
[20:11] tjholowaychuk: definitely do not eval
[20:11] devdazed: wadley, tjholowaychuk : thanks
[20:11] ceej: tjholowaychuk: if I've already done https://gist.github.com/43915af94ce20bf157a7 can I use that as my connect-redis connection?
[20:11] alcuadrado has joined the channel
[20:12] tjholowaychuk: ceej: only if you assign that client to the connect-redis .client
[20:12] tjholowaychuk: but typically no
[20:12] mjr_: Redis can handle a lot of connections though, so there's not much cost in having 2.

[20:13] mxp: npm install Reston yayyy it finally works :D
[20:13] tjholowaychuk: ceej: it uses SETEX though so make sure you have that

[20:13] tjholowaychuk: some people seem to have really old versions installed by homebrew or something

[20:34] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[20:34] alcuadrado: it seems to by outdated, as the node's github wiki recommends installing both node nad npm as a normal user, so sudo node and sudo npm won't work

[20:59] ceej: so I'm running all the latest express stuff and I still get session() middleware requires the "secret" option string for security all the conversations about that are for < 0.5.9
[20:59] ceej: and I'm running 0.5.9
[21:00] mnot has joined the channel
[21:00] tanepiper: it's from connect, not express
[21:00] tanepiper: express just wraps connect stuff

[21:00] tjholowaychuk: ceej: session({ secret: 'foo bar' })
[21:00] tanepiper: what tjholowaychuk said
[21:00] tjholowaychuk: people get really confused by that change :(
[21:00] tjholowaychuk: blah
[21:00] tjholowaychuk: lol
[21:00] tjholowaychuk: BUT makes it obvious no one was using it before
[21:00] tjholowaychuk: as they should have been
[21:00] tanepiper: also, now your awake read up tjholowaychuk :p

[21:01] ceej: tjholowaychuk: you mean like https://gist.github.com/0d1140764975a999fbd6
[21:01] tjholowaychuk: what did i miss
[21:01] tjholowaychuk: ceej: yeah
[21:01] ceej: still get that error
[21:01] tanepiper:  < tanepiper> tjholowaychuk: is knox still in active dev (i.e. will be updated to new http client), if not I'll take a punt at it because looks like we'll be using it
[21:01] tjholowaychuk: ohh
[21:01] tjholowaychuk: yes
[21:01] tjholowaychuk: but its low on my list of 0.4.0 stuf
[21:01] tjholowaychuk: plus the old client should still work
[21:01] tjholowaychuk: that api is still there
[21:02] tanepiper: it does
[21:02] tanepiper: was just wondering since this client is going to be using s3 a lot
[21:02] tjholowaychuk: ah
[21:02] tjholowaychuk: yeah

[21:50] tjholowaychuk: well the cookie stores the SID
[21:50] tjholowaychuk: and that talks to whatever your session store is..
[21:50] johnnywengluu: so even if i close the web browser the session cookie is there?
[21:51] tjholowaychuk: depending on how you set the cookie yeah
[21:51] johnnywengluu: ok
[21:51] johnnywengluu: sessions are better than cookies?

[21:55] kriskowal: anyone got a moment to talk about the "vm" module?
[21:56] isaacs: kriskowal: what's up?
[21:56] kriskowal: i'm trying to get SES5-Init to work, which involves transitively freezing the global object and whatever object rests at the base of the scope chain
[21:56] kriskowal: which does not appear to be accessible
[21:56] isaacs: what's SES5-Init?
[21:56] BGerrissen: @mscdex righto, http://pastie.org/1554236 (sorry, took a while)...
[21:56] kriskowal: looking at the code, it looks like the context is obscured by copying entries from the context's normal global object into a per-call global
[21:56] kriskowal: not sure tho
[21:57] ceej: tjholowaychuk: would you be able to help me a second, https://gist.github.com/4f7f162d3a7b21b80c7b the session on socket connect doesn't appear to be the current session at all as moo never gets added
[21:57] tjholowaychuk: ceej: just use 2 connections man
[21:57] kriskowal: SES5 is a script that the Caja team put together while writing the ES5 spec so that they could run a Caja VM on top of it without having to do as much preprocessing on the source
[21:58] ceej: tjholowaychuk: I want to share the session with socket.io
[21:58] tjholowaychuk: ceej: and I cant read that stuff
[21:58] tjholowaychuk: lol
[21:58] tjholowaychuk: so
[21:58] tjholowaychuk: i cant help
[21:58] kriskowal: basically, it's intended to deep freeze a context so it can be used by mutually suspicious scripts
[21:58] tjholowaychuk: and i dont have much time right now sorry dude
[21:58] Astro has joined the channel
[21:58] ceej: no problem
[21:59] kriskowal: isaacs, so it needs to enumerate and freeze the global, which appears to not be "this" and to not be the thing that gets assigned to when a free variable is written.
[22:00] mraleph: kriskowal: every module source is wrapped into an anonymous closure behind the scenes.
[22:00] isaacs: kriskowal: "this" refers to exports inside a module (i know, i know...), but global === (function(){return this})(), no?
[22:01] kriskowal: suffice it to say, i'm using VM, not a module
[22:01] kriskowal: i'll give the old closure trick a shot, but that won't work in strict mode
[22:01] isaacs: right
[22:01] isaacs: so, are you creating a new context, and then using runInContext, or just doing runInNewContext?
[22:02] kriskowal: i'm trying both
[22:02] isaacs: i think that if you pass in an object as the context, you can freeze that object first, right?
[22:02] kriskowal: i just need some way to lock down a context
[22:02] isaacs: (just tossing out ideas, i'm not sure exactly)
[22:02] kriskowal: preferably the current context, but i'll buy a new one if i have to
[22:02] kriskowal: instead of a wrapped context?
[22:02] kriskowal: haven't tried that
[22:03] kriskowal: the wrapped context does not appear to have an API for getting the contained global yet
[22:03] kriskowal: which might be helpful
[22:04] kriskowal: yeh, the function() (this)() trick doesn't work
[22:04] aguynamedben has joined the channel
[22:04] kriskowal: var VM = require("vm"); console.log(VM.runInThisContext("a = 10; (function() {return this})()"));
[22:04] kriskowal: that should produce {a:10}
[22:05] jano has joined the channel
[22:05] kriskowal: so i suspect VM is trying to hard to be clever
[22:05] tfe_ has joined the channel
[22:05] jesusabdullah: What is this vm package?

[22:06] jesusabdullah: Interesting.
[22:06] adambeynon has joined the channel
[22:08] kriskowal: i'm guessing that it is designed to alter the javascript semantics of script execution such that free variable assignment doesn't pollute subsequent calls to run*.
[22:08] kriskowal: which has the unintended side-effect of making it impossible to freeze the top of the scope chain, which would do the job even better.
[22:09] kriskowal: since a frozen top-scope would throw errors whenever a free variable is assigned, instead of silently capturing them in an inaccessible object
[22:09] tfe_ has joined the channel
[22:10] tfe_ has joined the channel
[22:10] mraleph: kriskowal: var VM = require("vm"); v = VM.runInThisContext("a = 10; (function() {return this})()"); v == global; 
[22:10] mraleph: kriskowal: prints true :-)
[22:10] kriskowal: which is to say that the top-scope inside the runner is not the global
[22:10] tfe_ has joined the channel
[22:10] mraleph: kriskowal: var VM = require("vm"); console.log(VM.runInThisContext("a = 10; (function() {return this})().a")); prints 10.
[22:11] kriskowal: does that strike you as odd?
[22:11] tfe_ has joined the channel
[22:12] kriskowal: hmmm.  var VM = require("vm"); console.log(VM.runInThisContext("a = 10; (function() {return this})()").a) does print 10 too, which is expected
[22:12] kriskowal: but without .a it prints {}
[22:12] tfe_ has joined the channel
[22:12] mraleph: a bit. somewhere between returning from script and passing it's result we loose a. 
[22:13] mraleph: kriskowal: not in REPL
[22:13] kriskowal: well, REPL is funky.
[22:13] mraleph: in repl adding .a to runInThisContext does not output anything.
[22:13] kriskowal: it generates a fresh context for each line
[22:13] Ezku\: trololololoo
[22:13] matyr_ has joined the channel
[22:14] kriskowal: which is not a good use of contexts, i might add.
[22:14] mraleph: the source of funkiness probably nests in V8's global object duality but I can't clearly see how :-)
[22:14] mikeal has joined the channel
[22:14] kriskowal: huh. is v8's global duality weirder than most engines?
[22:15] kriskowal: it's normal for the global to also be the top of the scope chain and also "this" at the top of the scope chain
[22:15] mraleph: this is not duality I am talking about. this is just JavaScript crap :-)
[22:15] mraleph: in V8 global object actually consists of two object
[22:15] mraleph: s
[22:15] mraleph: one is called global proxy
[22:16] janm has joined the channel
[22:16] kriskowal: which i presume is a copy-on-write structure
[22:16] kriskowal: so that it can harness the snapshot of the first primordials
[22:16] isaacs: kriskowal: it doesn't create a new context for each line
[22:16] mraleph: no. I don't think it is copy on write. I think it just collects all written values.
[22:17] isaacs: kriskowal: it just creates one for the repl session, and then a new one any time you do .clear
[22:17] kriskowal: huh, read on the mailing list that it did, must have changed.
[22:17] kriskowal: but that makes good sense.
[22:17] isaacs: the confusing issue is just that it uses one at all, which is unlike most js envs :)
[22:18] nivoc has joined the channel
[22:18] kriskowal: yes, which implies that trickery is being done behind the scenes to avoid type-mistmatches between node's core and each new context.

[23:42] symbolics: any advice on load testing socket.io on node.js? aimed at finding a good number for max concurrent connections.

[23:55] SubStack: alkavan: npm ls
[23:55] SubStack: oh
[23:55] SubStack: files >_<
[23:55] alkavan: ya
[23:55] SubStack: you can `npm explore pkgname` if you have the package installed
[23:56] isaacs: SubStack: npm explore is gonna be so much easier in the future
[23:56] isaacs: basically just cd ./node_modules/pkgname
[23:56] isaacs: in fact, it'll be silly to even have the cmd there
[23:56] SubStack: oh yeah?
[23:56] isaacs: yeah
[23:56] SubStack: rock
[23:57] balaa has joined the channel
[23:57] isaacs: might still be some complexity in some cases.
[23:57] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: if you clone a repo into ./node_modules (if it has index.js) it should work right?
[23:57] isaacs: like if you've linked it or globally installed it or whatever.
[23:57] tjholowaychuk: havent tried, just curious
[23:57] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: yeah
[23:57] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: or if it has a package.json with a "main" field.
[23:57] ceej: is there a reason why in express going to a different url the req.session is different?  is it not store across the entire app?
[23:57] tjholowaychuk: ok cool, because ive been telling people to do that haha
[23:57] tjholowaychuk: awesome
[23:57] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: we took a look at how you and rauchg were structuring things
[23:57] balaa has joined the channel
[23:58] SubStack: speaking of which!
[23:58] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: the new approach is basically that, but more optimized and less manual --> less room for human error
[23:58] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: i try to always have index.js at the root for cloning before

[23:58] ramsey_: hey guys i have a simple question about mongoose, im not sure where to ask
[23:58] SubStack: after node-ssh-server works I'll get socket.io working with browserify
[23:58] ramsey_: I hope someone from here will be able to help me?
[23:59] Guest94524: hi
[23:59] SubStack: isaacs: what if I don't like looking at node_modules when I type ls?
