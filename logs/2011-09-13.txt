[00:00] beriberikix: vicapow: So I have initialization code that needs to fetch something first before anything else can run
[00:00] vicapow: beriberikix: so pass it a callback
[00:00] brainproxy: beriberikix: i created a gist last night for someone who is asking about something similar
[00:01] brainproxy: https://gist.github.com/1210750
[00:01] brainproxy: the same principle could be used in your case, slightly adjusted of course
[00:01] brainproxy: or even just a simple callback might be enough
[00:01] davidbanham has joined the channel
[00:03] beriberikix: brainproxy: vicapow: I'm not sure I follow. What if many subsequent calls come in, a single callback won't be sufficient.

[00:03] beriberikix: Or I'm missing the mark
[00:04] KyleReese301: maybe i should start here: I currently have windows with apache running ( WAMP ) and i want to have Node.js running on apache as well, is this possible?
[00:04] brainproxy: beriberikix: then you may need to setup an evented flow with the help of EventEmitter
[00:04] ritch: brainproxy: nice gist… I like how the same concept could work for parallel operations
[00:05] brainproxy: ritch: thanks, maybe take a look at creationix's Step or TameJS
[00:05] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[00:05] brainproxy: http://tamejs.org/

[00:06] ritch: just keep it simple, ie your gist

[00:08] beriberikix: brainproxy: gracias :), I'll bbiab with more questions
[00:08] Vertice has joined the channel
[00:09] ritch: i wish express worked more like that.. instead of calling next() emitting a done event so that middleware that do not depend on each other can process at the same time
[00:09] joshkehn has joined the channel
[00:09] tjholowaychuk: ritch that's not always ideal..
[00:10] tjholowaychuk: it would easily be possible to support serial/parallel but configuration would be much more complex
[00:10] tjholowaychuk: certainly something to think about though
[00:10] Martz has joined the channel
[00:10] ritch: connect is awesome because its so simple
[00:10] yept has joined the channel
[00:10] tjholowaychuk: connect does the same thing
[00:10] ritch: ya i know
[00:11] ritch: but doesnt that model fall apart if you want to stream a response?
[00:11] ritch: and request
[00:11] tjholowaychuk: not really no
[00:11] tjholowaychuk: to some degree
[00:12] pandark_ has joined the channel
[00:12] tjholowaychuk: ideally we would have some way to define a state machine in which certain things must happen before others, some parallel, some serial blah blah
[00:12] matyr_ has joined the channel
[00:13] ritch: 3.0?
[00:13] tjholowaychuk: serial is not ideal but it works, parallel would be a huge fail, a mixture would work but be more confusing etc
[00:13] tjholowaychuk: and then you need explicit end-points
[00:13] KyleReese301: when i surf to my localhost running Node.js ( in IIS ) i get HTTP error 500.19 - Internal Server Error

[00:13] KyleReese301: anyone knows what i'm doing wrong?
[00:14] jchris1 has joined the channel
[00:14] ritch: what about opt-in parallel, leave app.use() the way it is
[00:15] tjholowaychuk: ritch yup it could be done
[00:15] tjholowaychuk: obviously it gets more confusing when you want to inject logic in there to say check if a user is authenticated etc
[00:16] tjholowaychuk: not a trivial thing to keep abstract

[00:19] qbert_: if not, just abandon it and use node directly, I setup node to work with apache its trivial, but only because it's on a server with a bunch of other stuff
[00:19] tjholowaychuk: ritch to some degree it's the choice of a) having an app that makes sense b) having an app that is slightly more responsive
[00:19] Marak has joined the channel
[00:20] qbert_: I side with "makes sense" every time
[00:20] tjholowaychuk: but like i said it's worth taking a better look into, i just dont have time right now, i've prototyped a few things though
[00:20] ritch: are they on github?
[00:21] tmzt: middleware that could match routes would be cool
[00:21] bogomips has joined the channel
[00:22] tmzt: like saying /admin/(.*) is all protected by this callback
[00:22] tjholowaychuk: protected?
[00:22] tmzt: authentication
[00:22] tjholowaychuk: app.get('/admin/*', callback)?
[00:22] MarkMenard has joined the channel
[00:22] tmzt: like that, but then you would just define the content as normal
[00:22] tjholowaychuk: or app.all('/admin/*', callback)
[00:23] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[00:23] tjholowaychuk: you can do that
[00:23] tjholowaychuk: just next() in there
[00:23] tmzt: ah
[00:23] tmzt: so what are they asking for
[00:23] tmzt: why parallel
[00:23] tzmartin has joined the channel
[00:23] tjholowaychuk: better latency in some cases
[00:24] tjholowaychuk: it would be great for some cases
[00:24] tjholowaychuk: ex uploads
[00:24] ritch: less memory if we can stream a req/res
[00:24] tmzt: just use raw for uploads :)
[00:24] tjholowaychuk: to be able to say i dont care about this data until the route
[00:24] tjholowaychuk: so run middleware and then dont exec the route until uploads are complete etc
[00:24] tmzt: and a subdomain
[00:24] dshaw_ has joined the channel
[00:24] tjholowaychuk: but they are all leaky abstractions

[00:51] Murvin: lol
[00:51] Murvin: sure let take a look too
[00:51] dreamdust: Agreed with AAA_awright. Choose the technology stack to fit your project, not the other way around.
[00:51] Nuck|mobile: dreamdust: Pssssssh
[00:52] aho: but node is fun D:
[00:52] Murvin: because the technology fit  on all other sides
[00:52] AvianFlu_: and if someone is doing it for fun, the rest doesn't matter
[00:52] AvianFlu_: I can build a lot of funky stuff if I'm just trying to explore node
[00:52] dreamdust: What's wrong with Calipso?
[00:52] AAA_awright: Take it from someone literally writing a CMS for Node (which is far more advanced than you want, if calip.so is)
[00:53] AAA_awright: Also, Nuck|mobile, also writing a website/framework with user content
[00:54] AAA_awright: Wait but I guess you disagree
[00:54] Murvin: well.. what i need are not complicated.    a server & db (mongo) store page information.   the page is html template.  so depending on the parameters, i just display the proper content from mongo. that's so easy with express.
[00:54] AAA_awright: Also, http://magnode.org/ <== Shameless plug
[00:54] Murvin: just that, i need a nice interface for the admin to update the content.
[00:55] brainproxy: cool AAA_awright, thanks for the link
[00:56] AAA_awright: brainproxy: It's nowhere near completion and still doesn't manage to sell itself well, on why this new idea is so much better than existing systems

[01:16] KyleReese301: yeah i got a PHP website with ajax and stuff and i was looking for a way to build a chat room with sockets, and then i found out about Node.js and i want to mix Node.js with PHP somehow, but there are not many resources available about that on the internet, yet

[01:57] cordoval: I am setting on my bashrc NODE_PATH="/usr/local/bin/node"
[01:57] cordoval: but still saying it did not find the path
[01:58] cordoval: can someone help me please? just trying to install zombie, I installed on ubuntu latest node (git) and npm with sudo, and now trying to do sudo npm install -g zombie

[02:03] airportyh: just the latter

[03:46] JakeyChan: function Server() {this.prototype = new customobject(); } can it work: (new Server()).send(); the send method come from custom object :)
[03:47] maxogden: ruby-n-company: can you elaborate on what you mean by 'a process'?
[03:47] ruby-n-company: Such as top (parsed for important information) or responding to messages in a message queue and passing information along.
[03:48] ruby-n-company: I'm 85% sure that it does the second quite well, but I'm not sure about running child or forked processes and getting data back from them at intervals (doesn't have to be exact, but close enough_

[04:29] Qbix1: hey guys
[04:29] Qbix1: we shouldn't modify require.paths ??
[04:29] Qbix1: how do we set the include path then? what is the convention
[04:31] mjijackson: Qbix1: don't mess with the include path.
[04:31] random123: I think he would like to know why
[04:31] mjijackson: you only have a single point of entry into your lib
[04:32] Qbix1: and so?
[04:32] Qbix1: Basically my entire framework relies on having require.paths at the moment
[04:32] Qbix1: I suppose I can write my own "require" function
[04:33] mjijackson: Qbix1: require.paths is gone in 0.5
[04:33] Qbix1: yeah probably a good idea
[04:33] mjijackson: Qbix1: why do you need to modify the include path?
[04:33] Qbix1: oh it is, huh
[04:33] mjijackson: what are you trying to accomplish? there is probably a better way.
[04:33] Qbix1: mjijackson: because of the way my framework structured its files
[04:33] Qbix1: yeah, I will just write my own Q.reqiure( ) function
[04:34] Qbix1: crap it's already gone eh
[04:34] Qbix1: but require.paths can still be set, no?
[04:34] mjijackson: a pattern that i've seen lately is to just implement a bunch of getters on your main module
[04:34] Qbix1: it just won't be used?
[04:34] mjijackson: that use lazy relative requires as needed.
[04:35] mjijackson: Qbix1: not sure if you can still set it or not. will probably emit some kind of a warning.
[04:36] Qbix1: Q.require = function (what) {
[04:36] Qbix1: 	var realPath = Q.realPath(what);
[04:36] Qbix1: 	if (!realPath) return;
[04:36] Qbix1: 	return require(realPath); };
[04:36] Qbix1: how's that
[04:36] mjijackson: Qbix1: there was a thread on the mailing list about this a while ago.
[04:36] mjijackson: http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs/browse_thread/thread/7d9f4c9e3ae4ca33/bc27fc13e26099db?lnk=gst&q=require.paths#bc27fc13e26099db
[04:36] Qbix1: I never set it. I just did this:
[04:36] Qbix1: require.paths.unshift(Q.CLASSES_DIR);
[04:36] Qbix1: require.paths.unshift(Q.app.CLASSES_DIR);
[04:36] mjijackson: you could respond to that thread if you need further clarification.
[04:36] Qbix1: ok
[04:36] Qbix1: next question:
[04:37] Qbix1: what is the "request" module in Node.js ?
[04:37] Qbix1: how come I can't find any docs on it
[04:37] Qbix1: require('request') is a function
[04:38] random123: Qbix1: If require.path remains as it was and becomes a convention, filenames will collide eventually
[04:38] random123: Qbix1: So just like PHP's include, you have to use relativity, ../file.js ./file.js to load them
[04:38] mjijackson: Qbix1: the request module is not part of core.
[04:38] random123: Qbix1: Or you can just set root = /path/to/file and do require(root + file);
[04:38] skm has joined the channel
[04:39] mjijackson: Qbix1: you probably installed something else that depends on it so that's why you have it installed.
[04:39] mjijackson: See https://github.com/mikeal/request
[04:39] mjijackson: that's the module you're looking for.
[04:39] mikeal: npm install request
[04:40] mjijackson: mikeal: i think he already has it installed. he's just wondering how to use it.
[04:40] Qbix1: mjijackson what odo u mean
[04:40] Qbix1: 'request' module is not part of the core?
[04:41] Qbix1: aha ok
[04:41] mjijackson: Qbix1: the core node distribution comes with several modules. the "request" module is not one of them.

[04:46] Qbix1: var Q = require('Q')
[04:46] mjijackson: yes you will.
[04:46] Qbix1: how?
[04:46] Qbix1: dependents?
[04:46] mjijackson: npm install -g mypackage
[04:46] mjijackson: that will install it in a "global" location that is part of your $NODE_PATH
[04:46] brainproxy: Qbix1: make sure to read the modules related sections of node's API
[04:46] brainproxy: mjijackson: no, I don't think that's correct
[04:46] mjijackson: +1 to what brainproxy said.
[04:47] Qbix1: When is this version of node coming out, which deprecates require.paths ?
[04:47] mjijackson: brainproxy: how so?
[04:47] Qbix1: this: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.5.5/api/modules.html#loading_from_node_modules_Folders ?
[04:47] mjijackson: Qbix1: it's the next release.
[04:47] brainproxy: Qbix1: require.paths is deprecated as of the 0.5 branch
[04:47] stelcheck has joined the channel
[04:48] brainproxy: mjijackson: globally install packages won't be picked up automatically with require()
[04:48] mjijackson: brainproxy: ah, yes. i got it backwards.
[04:48] mjijackson: globally installed packages make any binaries they include available at your command prompt. locally installed packages are available for requiring.
[04:49] dreamdust has joined the channel
[04:49] freeformz has joined the channel
[04:50] mjijackson: Qbix1: in any case, you just `npm install mypackage` and then you can do a `require("mypackage")` from any file in that directory or a subdirectory.
[04:50] jacobolus has joined the channel
[04:50] isaacs: brainproxy: actually, it was deprecated in 0.4, and throws an error in 0.5
[04:51] Qbix1: oh nice okay
[04:51] brainproxy: isaacs: cool, thanks for clarifying
[04:52] brainproxy: the 0.4 docs were a little confusing for awhile because on the one hand they suggested you could unshift on require.paths and on the other hand they said you shouldn't do that
[04:52] djMax has joined the channel
[04:52] sebastia_ has joined the channel
[04:52] djMax: how does one require query string params in express/node.js routing?
[04:54] random123: What would be nice is if you could define packages in a file or before you use it, like: mymod: /path/to/module then people can do require('mymod') because the whole controversy I think is wanting them to look uniform
[04:54] random123: So you can define the module name, and file location, somewhere else, will throw and error if there are duplicate names
[04:55] random123: so no collisions
[04:56] random123: or you can just push the modules onto an array like before, require.module(object that has mod name + file location), will throw error if the mod name is taken
[04:56] temp02 has joined the channel
[04:56] random123: then you can just do require('mod name')

[05:05] ruby-n-company: maxogden was helping me earlier, but I was trying to create something which spawns a child process and then runs it at an interval and then outputting to the client.
[05:05] ruby-n-company: https://gist.github.com/1213151
[05:05] ruby-n-company: I have this currently, but I only will receive one message. What am I missing to get this to run at an interval?
[05:07] mjijackson: ruby-n-company: you're trying to update a web page with the result of your system call on the interval?
[05:07] JSManiacs has joined the channel
[05:07] ruby-n-company: For now, yes.
[05:08] mjijackson: ruby-n-company: you need to poll your server.
[05:08] ruby-n-company: Well, currently it's just using ServerSent Events
[05:09] tmcw has joined the channel
[05:09] ruby-n-company: I updated the gist with the client-side code.
[05:10] ruby-n-company: I just can't get the spawned process to repeat at this point.

[05:11] ruby-n-company: Little brother to WebSockets.
[05:11] mjijackson: i see.
[05:11] mjijackson: interesting.
[05:11] ruby-n-company: http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/
[05:11] Qbix1: is "require" a keyword in node ?

[05:11] JSManiacs1 has joined the channel
[05:11] ruby-n-company: Also called EventSource

[05:11] mjijackson: Qbix1: that's fine.
[05:12] zemanel has joined the channel
[05:12] mjijackson: just don't overwrite the global require, or we'll have to take you out back...

[05:12] mjijackson: ruby-n-company: are you pretty sure the whole SSE is working properly?

[05:12] mjijackson: k
[05:12] ruby-n-company: Console on Chrome is showing the connection open and then one MessageEvent
[05:13] ruby-n-company: And if I feed it multiple events by hand, they will all show up. Am I just missing the lesson on the whole async idea? =/

[05:14] Qbix1: what do u think of my workaround
[05:14] Qbix1: http://pastie.org/2524677
[05:14] ruby-n-company: And just running an exec instead of a spawn?
[05:14] mjijackson: so you're creating a new object, `sar` every 2 seconds.
[05:14] SamuraiJack has joined the channel
[05:14] mjijackson: yeah.
[05:14] JaKWaC has joined the channel
[05:14] ruby-n-company: Okay. Thanks mjijackson. I'll try that
[05:15] mjijackson: the thing is, those listeners aren't automatically going to be set up on the new object that you create every 2 seconds.
[05:15] thalll has joined the channel
[05:16] petrjanda_ has joined the channel
[05:17] ruby-n-company: mjijackson: I guess that makes sense. If I bring it back to like jQuery DOM stuff, dynamically created elements obviously aren't going to inhierit the events created on document.ready (unless live or delegate obviously).
[05:17] mjijackson: ruby-n-company: right. that callback executes out of scope. so the listeners get set up on the first object you create but not on subsequent ones.
[05:17] mjijackson: Qbix1: it might work.
[05:18] mjijackson: how big is your framework? i think you might be better off figuring out how to use node_modules instead of trying to preserve require.paths.
[05:18] mjijackson: but if it's a ton of work to refactor...
[05:19] mjijackson: Qbix1: wait a second. is that a default argument i spy?
[05:20] mjijackson: that's not going to work how you want it to...
[05:20] mjijackson: well, on second thought, in this example it actually might.
[05:20] mjijackson: haha

[05:28] mjijackson: ritch: you could distribute your app with a node_modules directory in the root.
[05:29] mjijackson: this could contain the modules that you want to have available to modules within the plugins directory.
[05:29] mjijackson: since require traverses up the directory tree looking for node_modules directories, it will find them.
[05:29] ritch: good call
[05:29] mjijackson: i'm not sure if require will work properly with symlinks.
[05:29] ritch: it does
[05:29] mjijackson: but if it does, that would be the way to go.
[05:29] ritch: my whole ~/node_modules dir is symlinked to dropbox
[05:30] mjijackson: just symlink the useful modules from your lib directory into node_modules.
[05:30] mjijackson: ah, right on.
[05:30] Qbix1: okay guys so
[05:31] ritch: any idea how i can git ignore other packages besides my lib
[05:31] Qbix1: now I preserved require.paths and it works again
[05:31] Qbix1: but now I have a question
[05:31] cordoval has left the channel
[05:31] Qbix1: will I get deprecation warnings when I try to do this:
[05:31] Qbix1: if (!require.paths) 	require.paths = [];
[05:31] Qbix1: and then proceed to use require.paths
[05:32] mjijackson: ritch: you can use ! to whitelist files in your .gitignore
[05:32] mjijackson: kind of a useful feature.
[05:32] ritch: awesome
[05:32] ritch: exactly what i need
[05:32] mjijackson: so you could have in your .gitignore something like !node_modules/mymod
[05:32] mjijackson: but before it have a node_modules
[05:32] mjijackson: so it ignores all others
[05:33] ruby-n-company: mjijackson: https://gist.github.com/1213151 -- That did the trick. =]

[06:26] isaacs: mjijackson: thanks.
[06:26] mjijackson: you sir, are my new favorite.
[06:26] isaacs: mjijackson: it doesn't preserve the file info in the gzip headers, but meh.  you don't need that.
[06:27] isaacs: i'd be surprised if anyone actually needs that.
[06:27] mjijackson: right. most expect the file to unzip to the same name as the .gz anyway.
[06:27] chjj: mmm, gzip in core
[06:27] isaacs: mjijackson: well, if we give you a stream interface, you can always set all the info's on the target file if you know them anyway
[06:28] mjijackson: let's see, what other info is there? permissions and stuff.

[06:29] isaacs: oh, i guess it doesn't have *everythign* in stat
[06:29] mjijackson: next you'll be rewriting git in javascript
[06:30] mjijackson: and putting that in core.
[06:30] isaacs: mjijackson: hahah

[06:35] isaacs: Tobbe_: oh, probably not, then
[06:35] aho: i just put zeros there... well, basically... i was using zip tools to produce better compressed gzip files (there are hardcore zip tools but no hardcore gzip tools) at the end i just took that deflate stream and made a new file with it. couldnt be bothered to figure mtime and that other crap out. since it didn't matter i just used zeros to fill up the space
[06:35] mjijackson: aho: just figured out how to do it from the command line
[06:35] mjijackson: gzip -n myfile.txt
[06:36] mjijackson: omits the header info
[06:36] tmzt: colinux is essentially a raw kernel but using an interrupt/timer driven from a driver in the nt kernel, it can even access real hardware as long as windows isn't using it

[13:21] Glenjamin: doesn't seem unreasonable to have some sort of warning level, so things can be quiet by default, but you can turn up warning level

[13:21] Dmitrijus: even so, you cannot actually force a particular standard onto teh programmers :)
[13:22] Glenjamin: you can provide a standard, and ask people to use it
[13:22] Glenjamin: such as making require.paths immutable in master
[13:22] Glenjamin: silently immutable
[13:22] baudehlo: to be fair this is for core deprecations, so yes it can be forced.

[13:33] `3rdEden: also

[17:27] Aikar: JaKWaC: we run a CI process here, but spawning up a CI instance can take upwards to 30+ minutes... and each is tied to the branch it was created on, and a branch is based on a Jira Story. so we have 2 options, do multiple stories in 1 branch, then cherry pick commits when 1 story passes QA, or wait 30+ min per story and have syseng complain about resource usage.
[17:27] jchris has joined the channel
[17:28] Aikar: so im trying to do git-svn, checkout the branch of the CI env, then do a local git branch for each story topic, then merge into the CI branch and deploy to test, then when a story passes QA, merge from the local git branch instead of the CI branch
[17:28] Aikar: and then leave a CI branch up and running so the CI is ready to use
[17:28] Aikar: if i can get this process flourished, im sure many other teams will be interested
[17:28] Aikar: and will be a great start towards moving to git
[17:29] Aikar: syseng ran a top and was like "ugh are checking out the entire svn repo with git?" and im like "yep, ill let you guys know my findings ;)"
[17:29] JaKWaC: Yes indeed. That would be awesome.

[17:34] Aikar: it is a bit harder than it sounds :P

[17:35] jesusabdullah: that, or they wouldn't know version control if it smacked them in the face3

[17:37] patcito has joined the channel
[17:37] Aikar: DrMcKay: when you cant deploy cause syseng is in the middle of transitioning to git, it kills the process
[17:38] Aikar: therefor developer downtime

[18:09] billlazar: my bad
[18:09] jesusabdullah: It's cool :P
[18:09] jesusabdullah: billlazar: You might want to just look at undascore's implementation of pluck, if it sounds like it'll do what you want. Most of _'s functions are only a few lines
[18:10] billlazar: cool, will do

[18:15] Tobbe_: I added "app.use(express.logger());" to app.configure, but nothing shows up on stdout. What am I missing?
[18:15] tjholowaychuk: DrMcKay what are you doing? iterating the exports to define routes?
[18:15] tjholowaychuk: that wont work, but app.get() etc will

[18:16] esteth: Hi folks. I'm writing a fairly sizeable desktop-distributable program, and I'm wondering what the best option is for development. I do no network stuff at present, so this is mainly just a project to learn modern JS. Should I forgo node, and just use backbone.js and a bunch of <script> tags on a html page, or should I be using backbone in tandem with stitch or browserify? What if I want coffee script? Is this a framework I'

[18:28] guy: esteth: Ok. So, if I have a lot of experience with JS, developing web stuff. How quick would I be able to start building stuff with Node.JS
[18:28] esteth: it's a library on top of JS, along with a binary that executes the V8 javascript engine, loads node in, and runs your code

[18:30] guy: esteth: I see.

[18:33] guy: esteth: I did try Node.JS once, though I got lost in all the server side stuff. Then I started to study a lot a new programming language & Node.JS got out of my mind. The thing I didn't like too much about Node.JS that everyone kept pestering me about using different frameworks, when I wanted to learn simple stuff. It's like telling someone to use jQuery for someone who wants to learn javascript.
[18:34] quijote has joined the channel
[18:34] jesusabdullah: guy: What do you want to do, then?
[18:34] esteth: guy: The issue is that node.js is awful for writing websites in. by itself

[18:35] Jalava: 99% of time your web js code doesn't involve effiecient use of prototype rewiting, unittests, continuous integration, projects with hundreds of javascript files et al
[18:35] jesusabdullah: Use the shit out of libraries.
[18:35] jesusabdullah: If that means using express, then go for it.

[18:36] Jalava: but when you work with server code, you get into such projects really fast
[18:36] jesusabdullah: express is easy and nice

[18:36] Jalava: which itself is really simple
[18:36] jesusabdullah: guy: node.js is a javascript runtime with a module system and a small standard library aimed towards making IO (particularly network IO) easy and reasonable to do
[18:37] jesusabdullah: That means there is a nice http library, for example, that's easy to use but doesn't really do a lot *for* you

[18:38] esteth: anyone have any experience with browserify? I'd like to write a sizeable client-side app, but I'd like to have sane modules and do my testing with vows. Is browserify the best tool for the job here?
[18:38] jesusabdullah: It depends on how you roll esteth
[18:38] guy: anyway, that put aside. I will start reading tomorrow, so all the concepts will get clearer in time. Now, GBP 450 per day is pretty sick rate, isn't?
[18:38] jesusabdullah: browserify is great for code reuse and integrates well with express
[18:38] captain_morgan has joined the channel
[18:38] jesusabdullah: That said, some people like the alternatives better
[18:39] jesusabdullah: or prefer to cache their browserified code into static files
[18:39] esteth: jesusabdullah: Do you have a concise list of alternatives? I've seen stitch, which might be more up my street, but it lacks a command-line runner

[18:40] kiffness has joined the channel
[18:40] jesusabdullah: The one "downside" to browserify is that it absolutely does not support AMD
[18:40] joshkehn:  qbert_: vows
[18:40] Jalava: for me: nodeunit
[18:40] Jalava: and then connect
[18:40] jesusabdullah: because the author hates amd >:P
[18:40] jesusabdullah: fave libraries?
[18:40] joshkehn: AMD?
[18:40] jesusabdullah: node-irc honestly
[18:40] jesusabdullah: async module definition
[18:40] qbert_: yeah AMD sucks
[18:40] jesusabdullah: it's an alternative syntax to require
[18:40] joshkehn: Ah
[18:41] jesusabdullah: its api is shittier but it lets you load modules asyncronously, is my understanding
[18:41] esteth: jesusabdullah: I don't care about AMD. I'm shipping my software over an intranet, so I can afford to just download a massive file and then start the app
[18:41] jesusabdullah: browser-side people are convinced that they have to be able to start running shit right away so async module loading is a big demand

[18:44] Jalava: we were so deep in TDD we thought we had implemented the middleware already :D
[18:44] jesusabdullah: esteth: There are also a few npm modules for hosting exclusively client-side code through browserify, such as jquery-browserify

[18:46] baudehlo: I might just do it all in perl.

[18:58] jhurliman has joined the channel
[18:58] mikola: maxogden: Yep!  Here you go: https://github.com/mikolalysenko/JSGameShell
[18:58] mikola: One neat thing that I am proud of so far:  It does automatic object replication and persistence!
[18:59] mikola: by computing patches for entity state when it replicates it to the client
[18:59] mikola: which makes it possible to write the game code without worrying about how to synchronize it for the most part
[18:59] SubStack: handy for games
[18:59] mikola: (though clients are not necessarily all consistent, but this is IMO not such a big deal)
[19:00] mikola: plus they are eventually consistent given enough time
[19:00] mikola: SubStack:  It uses dnode :)
[19:00] rmzg: SUBSTACK
[19:01] SubStack: ARE EMM ZEE GEE
[19:01] rmzg: Long time no see
[19:01] kiffness has joined the channel
[19:01] SubStack: mikola: a general purpose pluggable replication lib on top of dnode would be super great I think
[19:02] mikola: yeah, I've been thinking about that
[19:02] SubStack: once you figure out the specifics of how those work best in practice with that framework
[19:02] mikola: it would solve a lot of problems not just in gaming
[19:02] mikola: right, I think at this stage I don't quite know how best to generate it
[19:03] mikola: though it handles both server-client replication and server-db persistence automatically
[19:03] qbert_: how do I change the content type with express,  res.set('Content-Type') ?

[19:08] mikola: I am also planning on doing some optimizations later on, like saving common strings on both the server and client
[19:08] mikola: so for example, if you have a field which changes a lot, you could replace it with a numeric constant that would only get transmitted once

[19:32] maxogden: as long as there is javascript source too :)
[19:32] isaacs: hornairs: list `coffee-script` as a devDependency, and your test harness program, and add a scripts.test command to run your tests.

[19:58] isaacs: jmar777: note the "versions" list

[19:59] isaacs: jmar777: maybe because your pacakge.json doesn't allow any other version?

[20:45] TheJH: rmzg, that checks for truthyness
[20:46] rmzg: Yup
[20:46] TheJH: rmzg, if you're sure it's an object, it should be fine
[20:46] rmzg: If the api is returning '0' instead of an object, I have bigger problems and want to abort anyway
[20:46] TheJH: rmzg, but if it could be a string or so, don't do it

[20:50] TheJH: cconstantine_, no. use an async library or so for that which can count completed callbacks or so
[20:51] CarterL: DrMcKay: huh
[20:52] cconstantine_: TheJH, any recommendations?

[21:42] isaacs: [diecast]: i'm sure tjholowaychuk would love patches, but you're gonna have to use 0.4.11 for now
[21:42] isaacs: [diecast]: that is, express actually doesn't work with node 0.5
[21:42] devaholic: denom: looks like you are inadvertantly chaining your calls?

[21:43] [diecast]: ok, so im going to havee to redo my installation method
[21:43] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: but you should relaly look into what's preventing 0.5 support.
[21:43] isaacs: 0.4 is getting kind of crusty.
[21:43] isaacs: 0.5 is starting to look pretty nice.

[22:39] isaacs: denom: you can also check out the source and run `make install` in it
[22:39] isaacs: denom: i recommend not running on master, though.  you can check out a tag.
[22:39] isaacs: denom: or you can download the tarball, crack it open, cd into it, and run `make install` in there.
[22:39] isaacs: denom: or you can take it and put it soemwhere, and run `node cli.js some npm command` in that folder.

[22:57] davidbanham: wibby: You can install them globally if you like, but it's neater to have a local installation for each app. That way you can keep different versions, etc.

[22:59] tjholowaychuk: not positive if i set it

[23:05] tjholowaychuk: davidbanham no it's not being set
[23:05] tjholowaychuk: im fixing it
[23:06] davidbanham: tjholowaychuk: Champion, thankyou. Let me know if there's anything I can assist with.
[23:06] tjholowaychuk: i wont be able to release for a day or two but you can merge the patches over if you want
[23:06] denom: tjholowaychuk, ahh, I see. I'm using the var Foo =  {} as my object and then using underscore to extend that
[23:06] tjholowaychuk: denom ah.. yeah dont do that
[23:06] denom: you are suggesting that I use a var foo = function(){} as the object
[23:07] tjholowaychuk: constructors are kinda lame but v8 is optimized for all this stuff
[23:07] denom: tjholowaychuk, how come?
[23:07] denom: how can I extend the constructor in my child class?

B is the child... when A calls b.send(...) and I inspect "this" from B's process.on('message', ...) it says "this" equates to A.  I would expect it to be B.  It's the same for when B calls process.send(...), then A's event handler see's "this" as being B.  That doesn't seem right to me, but maybe I'm just not thinking about this proper

[23:48] tjholowaychuk: halcyon918 you're probably confusing the pid with the pgid
