[00:00] cmr: barraponto: in the future you might check out nave or nvm
[00:00] SubStack: MrBig: just pretend that node doesn't use javascript at all
[00:00] cmr: barraponto: but that will get you going
[00:00] SubStack: MrBig: and think of it like python or ruby on the backend
[00:00] barraponto: cmr: nvm is equivalent of rvm?

[00:01] MrBig: let me give you an example, i used SuperAgent, for some ajax magic, i was sharing it with a friend, but he does not use node js, i was looking at the libraries and it seems like it is too much "tied to" node js
[00:01] cmr: barraponto: well, kinda
[00:01] ePirat: how do i get a file on the web using node? tried http.get and concating data until receiving 'end' but then i have newlines where before weren't ones...
[00:01] cmr: barraponto: nave is closer to rvm, most directly equivalent to python's virtualenv
[00:01] jesusabdullah: who wrote nave again?
[00:02] jesusabdullah: isaac?
[00:02] SubStack: MrBig: I don't know what that is but it's an issue with that library and not node
[00:02] cmr: Yeah
[00:02] barraponto: i'm used to both rvm and virtualenv
[00:02] jesusabdullah: I'm using nvm right now but I want to get nave rollin' instead
[00:02] barraponto: didnt get the difference between nave and nvm
[00:03] isaacs: jesusabdullah: yes?
[00:03] isaacs: jesusabdullah: oh, right, yes.  i did.

[00:03] xbayrockx has joined the channel
[00:03] xbayrockx: hey
[00:04] xbayrockx: So socket.io is a library for node.js? 
[00:04] jesusabdullah: isaacs: I agree, shit's whack
[00:04] jesusabdullah: xbayrockx: Yes
[00:04] jesusabdullah: xbayrockx: There's also a client-side library that's part of socket.io
[00:04] MrBig: SubStack: yah off, i was just asking, because, well, super agent does the same that jquery does, but its much more clean, it doesn't look like it would need a node js backend, however looking at the libs it seems it requires it, i am messing up somewhere, its at github.com/visionmedia/superagent its by the same guy that made express framework 
[00:04] jesusabdullah: like, it's two parts
[00:05] xbayrockx: Ok I see, I'm looking at Heroku for free web hosting, however it says that Websockets aren't supported. This website was suppose to support node.js, I don't get it?
[00:05] MrBig: damn autocompletion lol, messing up all my text 
[00:05] jesusabdullah: What's not to get? They support node but not websockets
[00:05] cmr: isaacs: Does it alert "here"?
[00:05] xbayrockx: Hmm
[00:05] xbayrockx: If I'm using Socket.IO I'll be using websockets, right ?
[00:05] `3rdEden: no
[00:06] `3rdEden: heroku is using a proxy infront of node.js
[00:06] cmr: xbayrockx: socket.io has multiple transports.
[00:06] `3rdEden: which kills te websockets
[00:06] jesusabdullah: I think it returns "returning: there"
[00:06] `3rdEden: so it will indeed use different transports there like cmr says
[00:06] cmr: Ah, yes.
[00:06] cmr: jesusabdullah: bad reading on my part
[00:06] xbayrockx: Ok, I'm wanting to create a game in javascript, it needs to be realtime
[00:06] jesusabdullah: http://wsping.jit.su just sayin' ;)
[00:06] xbayrockx: Should I be using websockets?
[00:06] ePirat: can anyone help me please?
[00:06] `3rdEden: xbayrockx then get a other hosting
[00:06] `3rdEden: go with nodejitsu.com
[00:06] cmr: xbayrockx: If you want to
[00:07] `3rdEden: or something else
[00:07] cmr: xbayrockx: It's fine to use socket.io, it will fall back if websockets aren't available.
[00:07] xbayrockx: fall back to what?
[00:07] xbayrockx: I'm failing to understand the different transports I think
[00:07] jesusabdullah: long polling, flash-based sockets, stuff like that
[00:07] `3rdEden: http://socket.io will tell you everything
[00:07] jesusabdullah: there are four or five of them in order
[00:07] cmr: xbayrockx: it's like a polyfill
[00:08] xbayrockx: So Websockets are the most desirable ?
[00:08] `3rdEden: websockets, flashsocket, htmlfile, xhr-polling, jsonp-polling to be exact ;)
[00:08] cmr: For realtime, of course
[00:08] jesusabdullah: well, they're the most fastest yeah
[00:08] xbayrockx: And that stuff is is behind the scenes?
[00:08] cmr: Yes
[00:08] xbayrockx: It just chooses, seamlessly, for me?
[00:08] cmr: socket.io exports a single interface.
[00:08] cmr: Yes
[00:08] jesusabdullah: xbayrockx: shit yeah dude
[00:08] mehlah has joined the channel
[00:08] `3rdEden: abstract all the things
[00:08] xbayrockx: I see, what's the difference in performance between Websocket and Adobe Flash Socket ?
[00:08] isaacs: cmr: just commented, refresh the gist
[00:08] xbayrockx: For realtime games
[00:09] `3rdEden: flash sucks
[00:09] `3rdEden: thats the difference
[00:09] subbyyy has joined the channel
[00:09] `3rdEden: + it takes time to initialize the plugin and flash connection
[00:09] cmr: xbayrockx: never seen any profiling but I can't imagine more overhead than the network itself.
[00:09] `3rdEden: so it's slower than other transports
[00:09] cognominal_ has joined the channel
[00:09] xbayrockx: Ok
[00:09] cmr: (after initialization, of course)
[00:09] xbayrockx: Are you talking, initial delay, higher pings, less bandwidth
[00:09] xbayrockx: or what
[00:09] `3rdEden: after it's initialized, there isn't a big difference anymore
[00:09] sdwrage has joined the channel
[00:10] xbayrockx: Cool, so initialization takes how long ?
[00:10] cmr: Can't imagine it'd take more than a few seconds
[00:10] `3rdEden: several seconds
[00:10] xbayrockx: I also noticed nodejitsu is private beta,
[00:10] `3rdEden: just go to #nodejitsu and ask for activation
[00:11] cmr: isaacs: that is very broken.
[00:11] cmr: ACTION goes to read the spec after finishing his food
[00:11] xbayrockx: So actually, I could just use any webhost provider, because it would just end up using AJAZ long polling ?
[00:12] callen: jazz hands?
[00:12] callen: ACTION waves hands wildly
[00:12] `3rdEden: xbayrockx no...
[00:13] `3rdEden: just pick a hosting that doesn't use a proxy infront of their node applications that kills the websocket connections
[00:13] `3rdEden: normal and decent web hosting services don't do that
[00:13] xbayrockx: I see
[00:13] jesusabdullah: xbayrockx: Didn't you see my sweet websocket demo? XD
[00:13] sdwrage has joined the channel
[00:13] xbayrockx: But the webhosting provider must support node.js, correct?
[00:13] xbayrockx: No, please show
[00:13] `3rdEden: yes.
[00:13] jesusabdullah: http://wsping.jit.su
[00:14] xbayrockx: Can I ask the purpose of putting a proxy infront of the node app
[00:14] maletor has joined the channel
[00:14] jesusabdullah: Well, think of it like this
[00:14] jesusabdullah: suppose you have 1000 servers just chillin' on AWS
[00:14] adrianmg has joined the channel
[00:14] jesusabdullah: with numerical ip addresses
[00:14] adrianmg has left the channel
[00:14] jesusabdullah: and you want to be able to take a bunch of urls like
[00:15] jesusabdullah: mySweetApp.heroku.com
[00:15] jesusabdullah: and make it so that when people visit x.heroku.com it forwards to the right server
[00:15] xbayrockx: oh i see
[00:15] FIQ has joined the channel
[00:15] jesusabdullah: hence, you put an http server in front that routes based on headers
[00:15] jesusabdullah: at least, this is one way to do it
[00:16] jesusabdullah: it's a common one at least
[00:16] xbayrockx: I see
[00:16] xbayrockx: So that means, without the proxy, what is the downfall ?
[00:16] jesusabdullah: no nice url
[00:17] xbayrockx: mk
[00:17] IrishGringo has joined the channel
[00:17] xbayrockx: can you give me an exampole
[00:17] xbayrockx: example
[00:17] jesusabdullah: well, like, when you go and deploy an app, you get back its url right? But if you don't have any way of connecting that url to the right app, you're kinda hosed right?
[00:17] mattgifford has joined the channel
[00:18] xbayrockx: Im new
[00:18] jesusabdullah: unless all the server IPs are external, but then you're still gonna have to connect to 172.some.annoying.number
[00:18] xbayrockx: So you mean
[00:18] level09 has joined the channel
[00:18] xbayrockx: I host a game, there are many game servers, say 10
[00:18] jesusabdullah: You have one server, but heroku probably has thousands
[00:18] xbayrockx: 1.gameserver.webhost.com 2.gameserver.webhost.com
[00:18] jesusabdullah: each with someone else's app on it
[00:18] xbayrockx: yah ?
[00:19] jesusabdullah: What happens is that *.webhost.com is on an external ip
[00:19] jesusabdullah: hooked into the dns system
[00:19] mattgifford has joined the channel
[00:19] jesusabdullah: or maybe a few ip's, you can have multiple balancers
[00:19] jesusabdullah: anyways
[00:19] xbayrockx: Ok, but that kills the websocket
[00:19] jesusabdullah: no
[00:19] jesusabdullah: only if your proxy sucks
[00:19] xbayrockx: oh
[00:19] jesusabdullah: some proxies don't kill websockets
[00:19] sdwrage has joined the channel
[00:19] jesusabdullah: like the one nodejitsu users
[00:19] jesusabdullah: works with websockets
[00:20] jesusabdullah: which is why that demo said "websockets" and didn't have 200+ms pingtimes
[00:20] jesusabdullah: other proxies just don't support websockets cause they're kinda new
[00:20] jesusabdullah: anyways
[00:21] xbayrockx: I see
[00:21] xbayrockx: Cool
[00:21] xbayrockx: Your websocket
[00:21] xbayrockx: Has 280ms
[00:21] xbayrockx: Is that to me?
[00:21] xbayrockx: im from aus so
[00:22] jesusabdullah: yeah, that would make sense
[00:22] jesusabdullah: if you're farther from the servers
[00:22] jesusabdullah: I'm on US west coast so probably pretty close physically
[00:22] jesusabdullah: My linode is in Fremont, just a few tens of miles away
[00:22] xbayrockx: is there source for your example
[00:22] shanebo: jesusabdullah, a friend and I are using the nodejitsu proxy and are wondering what latency, in general, it adds?
[00:23] shanebo: jesusabdullah on some occasions we're seeing it quadruple response times.
[00:23] disappearedng: Hey I wrote a game that involves multiple users on node. I am done writing the logic part and I am writing the front end code on the front end now (which will be rendered by rails). Aside from having multiple windows to simulate an actual game environment, what other strategies can I do? (Bots? Fake users?) Any advise? 
[00:23] jesusabdullah: xbayrockx: Not for that particular one, as it's just a proof that websockets work
[00:23] hackband has joined the channel
[00:23] jesusabdullah: xbayrockx: but I do have a deployable socket.io example kicking around
[00:23] xbayrockx: Can I see your source?
[00:24] xbayrockx: by the way, how does that prove websockets work
[00:24] jesusabdullah: shanebo: I haven't heard of it adding ridiculous latency times. I mean, my impression is that it's pretty fast
[00:24] xbayrockx: couldnt it just be using like AJAX long polling ?>
[00:24] xbayrockx: that node.js fell back on to ?
[00:24] jesusabdullah: xbayrockx: If they didn't work it would say "xhr longpolling"
[00:24] jesusabdullah: I actually check the transport
[00:24] rurufufuss has joined the channel
[00:24] xbayrockx: ok

[00:30] mightym: i reload doesn't have any effect, just login out an reaccess the page
[00:31] jesusabdullah: mightym: that's express behavior. Look into convincing it to work in "development" mode instead of in "production" mode
[00:31] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[00:31] jesusabdullah: That's my suggestion
[00:31] cmr: xbayrockx: If you make a game server, it means if you are running multiple nodes, you need to connect to an individual node instead of thrwoing a load balancer in front of it.
[00:32] cmr: (Which would be your most common use case, I'd think)
[00:34] michaelhartau has joined the channel
[00:34] mightym: jesusabdullah: you mean it doesn't matter deploying on production oder development?
[00:35] flipen has joined the channel
[00:35] jesusabdullah: no, what I'm saying is that it *does* matter. Production mode includes a bunch of caching for perf reasons while dev mode doesn't cache so you can see changes right away

[01:01] jesusabdullah: mikl: You have, var spawn = require('child_process').spawn();

[01:02] jesusabdullah: callen: callback?
[01:02] callen: checking
[01:02] ryanrolds: But, you can still solve the problem with out. You need to count the requests going out and count them coming in and wait until you get them all back or they timeout.
[01:02] callen: the callback is what's executing
[01:02] callen: it's not that simple
[01:03] callen: I need code to execute after the HTTP requests are all done.
[01:03] jesusabdullah: yeah, so another callback

[01:03] ryanrolds: Yup.
[01:03] callen: timing out and counting which ones have completed

[01:03] ryanrolds: This isn't a new problem. This is how it's always been with multiple XHR requests.
[01:04] callen: so am I just invoking another function that runs a while loop and checks proposed tweets?
[01:04] cmr: callen: No, use setTimeout
[01:04] cmr: setInterval, sorry
[01:04] cmr: while loop blocks

[01:13] cmr: I don't think there is any better code hosts out there.
[01:13] cmr: s/is/are/
[01:14] jesusabdullah: Yeah, I don't think so either
[01:14] jesusabdullah: bitbucket looks nice
[01:14] insin: ACTION switched to git pretty much just because of GitHub
[01:14] cmr: I'd definitely pay money for it if they started charging.
[01:14] cmr: ... don't tell them that ;
[01:14] cmr: )
[01:14] jesusabdullah: I *do* pay money for a few closed source repos
[01:14] jesusabdullah: only a few though
[01:14] jesusabdullah: and their limits are way soft so
[01:14] callen: cmr: they won't though, they're pretty dedicated to their public/closed charging model.
[01:14] jesusabdullah: you can fudge it a bit
[01:14] xbayrockx: so jesusabdullah, wheres your source code?
[01:15] jesusabdullah: well xbayrockx, click a project
[01:15] cmr: xbayrockx: click on any of the project tiles
[01:15] napperjabber has joined the channel
[01:15] xbayrockx: ah i see
[01:15] jesusabdullah: Yeah, neat huh?
[01:15] jesusabdullah: the most important thing github did right imo was making it so that the file tree and readme are the first things you see
[01:15] xbayrockx: so i guess i need ot make a free web host account that supports node.js
[01:15] jesusabdullah: virtually everyone else fucks this up
[01:15] xbayrockx: can you recommend one
[01:16] xbayrockx: i also need mysql, php
[01:16] jesusabdullah: uhhh
[01:16] jesusabdullah: you either want a vps from a place like linode, rackspace, whatever
[01:16] jesusabdullah: or you want a PaaS or two
[01:16] xbayrockx: cant have one already set up ?
[01:16] jesusabdullah: and which one of THOSE you pick depends on what you need
[01:16] cmr: xbayrockx: Nope.
[01:16] cmr: xbayrockx: 
[01:16] cmr: (sorry)
[01:16] xbayrockx: why not
[01:17] jesusabdullah: dotcloud and heroku are doing the polyglot thing
[01:17] xbayrockx: what is polyglot
[01:17] jesusabdullah: >1 language
[01:17] xbayrockx: such as?
[01:17] jesusabdullah: like, I work for nodejitsu, and we specialize in node
[01:17] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[01:17] xbayrockx: heroku dont support websockets
[01:17] cmr: So?
[01:17] jesusabdullah: whereas heroku does rails and node and probably other languages as well
[01:17] jesusabdullah: and dotcloud does like a dozen different platforms
[01:17] cmr: Most browsers don't support websockets.
[01:18] gkatsev: not true.
[01:18] gkatsev: stable chrome and firefox support websockets
[01:18] xbayrockx: I see, what do they mostly support then?
[01:18] cmr: gkatsev: far from most
[01:18] gkatsev: safari and opera support it but have it turned off
[01:18] jesusabdullah: xbayrockx: not sure, I work for nodejitsu not for heroku
[01:18] gkatsev: IE>9 support websockets, probably
[01:19] cmr: Just because they are available doesn't mean people use them (though that situation is getting much better)
[01:20] gkatsev: you can't use excuse that most browsers dont suppor them.
[01:20] gkatsev: I mean, marketshare wise, possibly
[01:20] gkatsev: but not browser number
[01:20] xbayrockx: so jesusabdullah, what does nodejitsu do ?
[01:21] xbayrockx: its web hosting that supports node.js right? what else, ?
[01:21] indexzero has joined the channel
[01:21] jesusabdullah: that's it!
[01:21] jesusabdullah: We specialize in node.js
[01:21] xbayrockx: what if you need database
[01:21] xbayrockx: like mysql
[01:21] jesusabdullah: get one from elsewhere, connect from outside
[01:22] xbayrockx: isnt that slow ?
[01:22] jesusabdullah: We have a built-in api for requisitioning nosql databases
[01:22] jesusabdullah: that makes it way easy
[01:22] jesusabdullah: not necessarily slow
[01:22] jesusabdullah: depends on what kind of latency you need
[01:22] cmr: gkatsev: market shares are the only thing that matter :). If you consider each version number a different browser (which they essentially are, just common codebase and branding) then far more don't support websockets (But that's a technicality)
[01:22] jesusabdullah: irl systems use remote DBs all the time
[01:22] xbayrockx: for a real time game
[01:22] xbayrockx: that would be bas
[01:22] xbayrockx: bad
[01:22] gkatsev: cmr: firefox and chrome together are about half of the world browser marketshare.
[01:22] jesusabdullah: not necessarily xbayrockx 
[01:23] jesusabdullah: I mean, is the distance between your servers *really* your bottleneck?
[01:23] jesusabdullah: or rather, between your servers and your redis?
[01:23] cmr: gkatsev: Chrome sure, has something like 20% I think. But firefox, which version? My mother was still using 3.6 until I educated her.
[01:23] jesusabdullah: Plus, if you're smart about it you can get them pretty close physically
[01:23] jesusabdullah: but yeah, welcome to the cloud
[01:23] gkatsev: cmr: chrome and ff have like 25% each.

[01:23] gkatsev: let me find the stats
[01:24] cmr: xbayrockx: "Free web hosting" as you think of it (Cpanel and all that) really, really sucks. For what you want, you definitely want a VPS.
[01:24] Aliv3_: hey so I do fs.syncFileRead(file) how do i convert that into text
[01:24] jesusabdullah: What's cpanel?
[01:24] cmr: jesusabdullah: crappy frontend to bunches of tools, lets you do configuring of things from a web interface.
[01:24] jesusabdullah: I never really wasted any time with the free web hosting after the geocites era
[01:24] gsmcwhirter: Aliv3_: fs.syncFileRead(file, "utf8") will give you a utf8 encoded string of the contents
[01:25] Aliv3_: thanks
[01:25] gsmcwhirter: Aliv3_: and it is fs.readFileSync

[01:25] Aliv3_: yeah sorry i was using right function in my console just not irc, and thanks for extra utf8 param.
[01:26] xbayrockx: i see
[01:26] xbayrockx: does that mean you can put whatever you want on it ?
[01:26] cmr: Of course.
[01:26] blueadept has joined the channel
[01:26] gsmcwhirter: Aliv3_: np. You can also use 'ascii' and some other values there to specify the encoding. when you don't specify it, you get a buffer

[01:27] gkatsev: prgmr.com is cheap and so is 2host
[01:27] Aliv3_: you know how if i do FileRead i use a function for a second parameter, and it gives error for first and data for second, how do I catch errors with that? try{}catch(ex){} ?

[01:35] Aliv3_: 64* thanks

[01:35] cmr: You can just use application/octet-stream

[02:35] zomg: clutchski: There is no such thing as ORM for mongo. Mongo is not a relational DB, thus you don't need object-relational mapping ;)
[02:36] zomg: I've used Mongoose myself which has worked pretty well and has convenient features
[02:36] shanebo: zomg, you can relate objects in mongo

[02:42] crickeys has joined the channel
[02:43] crickeys: If I have a function that I created in node, when would node consider it to be asynchronous and when would it just return right away?
[02:44] cmr: It is only asynchronous if you use setTimeout, setInterval, or any of the built-in async functions (AFAIK)
[02:44] cmr: It returns normally when you tell it to
[02:45] crickeys: cmr: are you familiar with socket.io?
[02:45] cmr: crickeys: On a surface level
[02:45] crickeys: so, on socket.io they have a Memory data store where you can do things like this:
[02:45] soapyillusions has joined the channel
[02:46] crickeys: socket.get("my_variable", function(err, my_variable){ // do whatever })
[02:46] khrome has joined the channel
[02:46] cmr: Right.
[02:46] crickeys: so, if I call 4 of those one after the other
[02:47] crickeys: are they guaranteed to run in sequential order?
[02:47] crickeys: because socket.get doesn't RETURN anything, it just executes a callback
[02:48] brngardner has joined the channel
[02:48] cmr: Looking at socket.io, it's synchronous
[02:49] cmr: But don't trust me on that ;)
[02:49] cmr: I think they present the async API for thins like the redis store.

[02:50] cmr: crickeys: Callback doesn't always mean asynchronous you know
[02:50] blup has joined the channel

[02:51] crickeys: okay, must be a different bug then :)
[02:52] cmr: crickeys: Don't rely on them be run sequentially though

[02:56] foobazr: cmr: Here is the code http://pastebin.com/DjpbsPWJ
[02:56] clutchski: crickeys: i think some promise libraries like Q, will always resolve their deferreds that are actually synchronous (like the memory store API that you're talking about) in a setTimeout(…, 0) so that you can't write code that accidentally works because the callback is synchronous and breaks if you swap in a async API.

[03:04] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[03:05] barraponto: cmr: virtualenv creates environments, with variables, paths, packages
[03:05] cmr: Right
[03:05] cmr: rvm versions ruby itself?
[03:05] barraponto: cmr: rvm creates gemsets (and changes the binary).
[03:06] barraponto: rvm is like "let's see if my project works with this alternative set of packages"
[03:06] barraponto: while virtualenv is "i'm going to work with project conquertheworld, let's setup the environment properly"
[03:07] cmr: Nice
[03:07] barraponto: using both (which is only possible with npm + nave) means you can setup your environment, then pick your packages.
[03:07] isaacs: nave supports named envs now, too
[03:07] barraponto: you can have a 'dev' package that exists only for project X.
[03:08] isaacs: nave use someproject
[03:08] isaacs: then pick the version of node to use, and it'll set up a separate global env for just that project.
[03:08] barraponto: isaacs: do you recommend using npm with nave? or is it just double rainbows?
[03:08] isaacs: barraponto: "JUST" double rainbows!??
[03:08] isaacs: what does that even MEAN?

[04:12] Registered: do you have a template with the name 404 ?

[06:56] dingomanatee: I have a question - its kind of verbose but
[06:57] dingomanatee: I want to create a web app framework wherein there is an arbitrary deep hash of parameters
[06:57] dingomanatee: The running framework has a  set; controllers have a set, but they inherit the frameworks. 
[06:58] dingomanatee: actions also have specific parameters, but they inherit from the controller and indirectly from the framework. 
[06:58] dingomanatee: lastly individual requests also get parameters, both fom the request/body/et all and from their execution cycle. 
[06:59] dingomanatee: Parameters can be rewritten as part of the execution cycle by writing into the request objects' params
[06:59] JarrodBell has left the channel
[07:00] dingomanatee: but my main concern is that I don't want activity in any given request to potentially alter parameters that may have links back to actions, controllers or the framework.

[07:53] alyx_: andrew12: what's the difference between a key/value store and a database?
[07:53] alyx_: they both store data.
[07:53] medice: how would i know what they have heard
[07:53] andrew12: alyx_: well, it depends how you define 'database'
[07:54] mdel: any AWS experts here? /OT
[07:54] andrew12: if a database is anything that stores data, then sure, redis is a database. so is a text file. csv, yaml, json, etc
[07:54] systemfault: Well..
[07:55] systemfault: Database usually means RDBMS
[07:55] andrew12: no
[07:55] andrew12: couchdb and mongodb aren't relational databases

[08:02] Lingerance: Note line 64
[08:02] Lingerance: The callback always gets an array
[08:03] Lingerance: Only from line 66&75 does it get an empty array all the time.
[08:03] hortinstein: Lingerance: ok, but why does he add something that does nothing...than is cleared out after 30 seconds
[08:04] hortinstein: oh wait
[08:04] hortinstein: Lingerance: oh wait, is it for callbacks that dont nessecarilly have messages?

[08:49] misza222: hi folks
[08:49] Shaunzie: herro
[08:49] misza222: what are the best practices in storing config stuff for servers in node.js?
[08:50] Shaunzie: json?
[08:50] misza222: ok, so how would it work?
[08:50] misza222: I am sorry, I am new to node
[08:50] Shaunzie: config data is kinda trivial, so do can do what ever you want.
[08:50] EndangeredMassa: json file, require it in your app. Some people set it to a global variable as well.
[08:50] Shaunzie: be creative
[08:51] misza222: I want to separate code from config
[08:51] misza222: that's the point, I don't want to store passwords in the vc
[08:51] RLa: put config.json into ignore and put config.example.json into vcs, that's how config file is kept
[08:51] misza222: sure, make sense
[08:51] RLa: example should not contain real passwords
[08:52] cognominal_ has joined the channel
[08:52] misza222: thx, pretty obvious
[08:52] RLa: btw, if possible, replace passwords with certs and api keys

[08:57] redwinter: In app.js, I have require('./models') -- my models/ directory has a number of files. However, node says: "Cannot find module './models'". Thoughts?
[08:59] EndangeredMassa: If you want to require a whole directory, you have to create an index.js file in that directory. In that module, you can require the other modules in the directory and bundle into your index.js module.
[09:00] mattgiff_ has joined the channel
[09:00] redwinter: EndangeredMassa: Within index.js, is there a way to require all of the files in the directory without specifying them explicitly?
[09:00] Shaunzie: redwinter: require('./models') is expecting a models.js file in your cwd

[09:17] Shaunzie: rohanrhu: mmm can't really tell you how to do that. that's not really a node.js specific problem, so I won't be of any help :-/. I would suggest referring to the Adobe docs or googling.
[09:17] Bonuspunkt has joined the channel
[09:18] level09 has joined the channel
[09:18] rohanrhu: Shaunzie: thanks
[09:18] Shaunzie: CoolGuy_: node comes with a built in REPL. so you can run "node" from the command line to play with javascript.
[09:19] CoolGuy_: hmm ok
[09:19] CoolGuy_: what im trying to do is
[09:19] CoolGuy_: i have a file with all my js functions...and i want to call them from node command line
[09:19] Shaunzie: CoolGuy_: you can use the -e, --eval option if you want to execute a command from without entering REPL
[09:20] Shaunzie: CoolGuy_: you'd need to export the function and the use require('__FILE__').__FUNCTION_NAME_HERE_() to call it
[09:20] CoolGuy_: ahhh
[09:21] EndangeredMassa: redwinter: Not sure. I imagine a lot of people use express on its own, creating their own MVC setup. Railway is cool, but I ran into issues with it pretty quickly.
[09:21] CoolGuy_: but i have to use require? i cant just go testingFunction() in command line, for example?
[09:21] jimt_ has joined the channel
[09:22] Shaunzie: CoolGuy_:  no because the function does not exist with in the global scope. 
[09:22] martin_sunset has joined the channel
[09:23] Shaunzie: CoolGuy_: you can do var stuff = require('__FILE__HERE__
[09:23] CoolGuy_: hrmm ok
[09:23] jesusabdullah: copy and paste also works
[09:24] EndangeredMassa: CoolGuy: You could also change your js file to add functions to the global object. Then, when you require that file, you can simply type `testingFunction` in the node repl and it should work.
[09:24] redwinter: EndangeredMassa: What kind of issues did you find?
[09:25] CoolGuy_: yeah, i think thats what im trying to do actually...i made all my functions already, just trying to do that pretty much
[09:25] CoolGuy_: how do i add to the global object tho?
[09:25] jesusabdullah: whoa whoa whoa
[09:25] agnat_ has joined the channel
[09:25] jesusabdullah: no adding crap to the global object
[09:26] jesusabdullah: because your end goal is to write a reusable module here
[09:26] EndangeredMassa: haha, yeah, it's generally a bad idea, but it does what the guy wants to do. 
[09:26] cognominal has joined the channel
[09:26] EndangeredMassa: global.testingFunction = function(){ /};
[09:26] jesusabdullah: but you want to look a step ahead here
[09:26] EndangeredMassa: woopse:   global.testingFunction = function(){ /* code here */ };
[09:26] jesusabdullah: you're not just "testing some function", you're testing a full module
[09:27] jesusabdullah: it's better to write it right the first time
[09:27] CoolGuy_: hmmm ok
[09:27] CoolGuy_: so this concept of modules
[09:27] EndangeredMassa: redwinter: I'm trying to remember. It was a bit ago.
[09:28] SubStack: `global` had better go away soon
[09:28] jesusabdullah: alright
[09:28] redwinter: EndangeredMassa: Oh okay, gotcha.
[09:28] SubStack: the only time I ever use it is on the repl
[09:28] SubStack: and that is really rare
[09:28] jesusabdullah: SubStack: you keep an eye on these foos, I'm hitting the hay
[09:28] EndangeredMassa: redwinter: I do remember that the coffeescript support was incomplete with the generators available. (Not a huge deal, obviously, but annoying.) 
[09:29] EndangeredMassa: redwinter: I still intend to go back to it and give it another go. I wanted to play with it and possibly add some stuff. Are you a contributer or the creator?
[09:29] SubStack: EndangeredMassa: if you want to write clean tests check out some of the testing harnesses on npm
[09:29] SubStack: my favorite right now is tap
[09:29] redwinter: EndangeredMassa: None of the above. Just trying to choose a node.js-based platform for development. Might roll my own express/MVC mashup.
[09:30] EndangeredMassa: SubStack: I think you meant to @ that to someone else. =P
[09:30] EndangeredMassa: I am enjoying jasmine right now.
[09:30] SubStack: oh seems so
[09:30] SubStack: enjoying? jasmine?
[09:30] SubStack: sounds impossible
[09:30] EndangeredMassa: hah, why's that?
[09:30] EndangeredMassa: redwinter: Ah. Definitely check it out. It is a cool system, especially if you know some Ruby on Rails. Also, take a look at flatiron from the nodejitsu guys.
[09:31] EndangeredMassa: redwinter: But, building your own on top of express isn't hard. 
[09:32] redwinter: EndangeredMassa: I do have a Rails background, so I'll give it a try. I'll check out flatiron too, thanks!
[09:32] jondot: anyone doing boilerplate removal with node.js (and not using node-readability) ?
[09:33] jondot: hello SubStack :)
[09:34] EndangeredMassa: SubStack: Why the jasmine hate? I've not used tap.

[09:35] tokka has joined the channel
[09:35] Heisenmink has joined the channel
[09:36] EndangeredMassa: Well, using rspec certainly makes it easier to switch contexts to jasmine, even though the assertions are different.
[09:36] SubStack: ewww
[09:37] SubStack: describe() it() and expect() everywhere makes me cringe
[09:37] SubStack: global exports, super lame
[09:38] SubStack: I much prefer modules that take the node assert module style and add some helpers around it
[09:39] EndangeredMassa: I don't mind the globals because I'm in a testing context.

[14:37] riojj: I have this methods which should load modules first from a special directory, if the module is not found there it should fallback to the original require way. 
[14:37] chuckyorg has joined the channel
[14:37] deoxxa: that's nice
[14:37] riojj: which is the better way, try catching the require.resolve and see if the error is cannot find module, or using fs.stat to see if the file exists?
[14:37] riojj: or another way?
[14:39] deoxxa: riojj: you can try using NODE_PATH (the environment variable)
[14:40] deoxxa: then it'll take care of itself
[14:40] deoxxa: but the best way is just to put them in node_modules tbh
[14:41] riojj: I don't want to force people to add stuff to their NODE_PATH just to run this application
[14:42] deoxxa: can you explain why you're putting the modules in a special place?
[14:42] riojj: and the reason I rather have another directory is to separate "plugins" to the application from modules that the application itself uses
[14:43] shinuza has joined the channel
[14:43] deoxxa: we had a similar system at work - it ended up much nicer to put them in node_modules
[14:44] deoxxa: you could, however, specify the location explicitly
[14:44] LarsSmit has joined the channel
[14:44] deoxxa: i.e. require("./my_plugin_directory/my_plugin_name")
[14:44] deoxxa: or __dirname + "./my_plugin..."

[14:45] qsobad has joined the channel
[14:46] tytsim_ has joined the channel
[14:46] riojj: ye ofc, that's basically what the method should do. Theres a config in which you set what plugins to be loaded on application startup. and then it just loops those and does the require method I was talking about on each
[14:46] riojj: and in that config I could force people to use the whole path
[14:46] qsobad has joined the channel
[14:46] riojj: but that doesnt seem as user friendly
[14:48] deoxxa: really it seems you're complicating things more than you need to be - what's the difference between putting something in ./plugins and ./node_modules?
[14:48] hackband has joined the channel
[14:49] riojj: nothing other than structural, not having dependencies for the application and the users own plugins in the same folder
[14:49] riojj: It's not that complicated tbh =)
[14:51] deoxxa: well no, it's not
[14:51] deoxxa: but it seems like you're working around a problem that doesn't exist
[14:52] deoxxa: don't get me wrong, i did the same thing
[14:52] riojj: maybe you're right, maybe I should just use node_modules folder. But to me it feels cleaner in having it's own directory
[14:53] deoxxa: we had pretty much exactly the same system at work (we have a plugin architecture for our data processing system), but it was more trouble than it was worth
[14:53] deoxxa: basically if someone's up to the task of downloading, extracting and putting in place a plugin, they don't care what the directory name is
[14:53] deoxxa: if they're not, the name of the directory isn't going to matter anyway
[14:55] deoxxa: also if you leave intact the way the module loading works, they'll get meaningful answers when they google any loading-related errors

[15:32] RLa: huh, people still use jsp?
[15:32] deoxxa: apparently!
[15:32] noobie25_1776: RLa:   haha...yea.. i'm hoping to slowly change everythign to node.js.  I followed some examples and love it.
[15:34] RLa: jsp is one of those languages that was made to look like xml to confuse editors
[15:34] noobie25_1776: deoxxa:  i'm considering the webservice option you mentioned and create something simple in node.js to take a url as input and it will output back the html for that page.
[15:34] RLa: other than that, it's not so bad in my opinion
[15:35] RLa: you could move some html generating to client side as well
[15:35] deoxxa: allow me to whore my project: https://github.com/deoxxa/node-ginger (templating engine for javascript)
[15:35] noobie25_1776: deoxxa: basically, i'd like nodejs to be able to webscrape certain parts from a webpage.  I guess I can make a http webservice all from within java.
[15:36] noobie25_1776: deoxxa: RLa  how can i do this on client side?  You mean jquery + ajax as one solution?
[15:36] RLa: yes
[15:37] deoxxa: that'd be one way to do it
[15:37] marcello3d has joined the channel
[15:37] RLa: for some reasons i like to generate markup on client side, seems more natural
[15:37] deoxxa: i do both when i can
[15:37] mansoor: noobie25_1776: you can actually do your scraping on node too, you can run a headless browser and jquery on it
[15:38] TheJH: deoxxa, have a look at mine - https://github.com/thejh/node-vacuum - it has streaming and stuff :)
[15:38] deoxxa: i serve the initial page as HTML, then everything after as JSON
[15:38] noobie25_1776: mansoor: ?
[15:38] webben: noobie25_1776: What's the goal of moving from your existing stack to node?
[15:39] deoxxa: TheJH: looks like it has some shared goals with mine
[15:40] deoxxa: TheJH: what's the benefit over something like EJS?
[15:40] deoxxa: seems pretty similar
[15:40] noobie25_1776: webben: easier development with async calls being made.  also, i'm unsure how I will scale using tomcat, but seems like there are some good approaches using node.
[15:41] deoxxa: aside from the syntax, of course
[15:42] webben: noobie25_1776: Don't really see why your Java setup wouldn't scale where Node would. Particularly if you're proposing to hybridise your stack.
[15:42] jaequery has joined the channel
[15:43] noobie25_1776: what are some good approaches implementing how facebook (scraps titie & photo when posting a url) when you make a post.
[15:43] TheJH: deoxxa, does ejs have streaming rendering?
[15:43] deoxxa: i'm not sure, i think so
[15:43] TheJH: deoxxa, can you use arbitrary functions inside of templates?
[15:43] webben: noobie25_1776: Add to the URL to a queue with scraper workers that update your data storage.
[15:44] deoxxa: i'm pretty sure you can...
[15:44] deoxxa: i've actually not used it too much
[15:44] deoxxa: it just looks like it'd feel very much like JS using it
[15:44] mansoor: noobie25_1776: Use the  "request" module and make your request to the URL and use a a headless browser like "zombie" for the actual scraping 
[15:45] mansoor: node-jquery   not zombie
[15:45] noobie25_1776: headless browser..i've never used before.
[15:46] webben: phantom.js might be worth a look here
[15:46] webben: as it uses a real web engine
[15:46] mansoor: noobie25_1776: https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom is what i'd go with

[15:47] mansoor: DOM is the devil :(
[15:47] deoxxa: indeed it is
[15:48] noobie25_1776: so whether i'm using php or jsp ... i'd just make a webservice call to node to scrap the info i need?
[15:48] torvalamo: i prefer DOM over parsing the page myself though

[15:49] webben: noobie25_1776: What do you mean?

[15:49] deoxxa: you could just do it in jsp/php as well
[15:49] mansoor: noobie25_1776: If you are making the webservice just to use node then yes, otherwise it would be much faster to just implement it in your existing platform
[15:50] mansoor: *on

[15:51] mansoor: Now, I shall do something very bad.. Sync IO!!!

[15:53] webben: Seems just as likely you'd end up stuck with a hybrid stack forever.
[15:54] noobie25_1776: I feel like it is faster development.  Isn't it pretty quick to install node.js, have it do a few tasks (post some data into db) and return a response code.  
[15:56] webben: That's all additional development to your existing stack.
[15:56] webben: And getting something installed and doing something simple is simple with most stacks.

[16:03] mansoor: Making a game :D
[16:04] t1l7: RLa: it's quite hard to set the specs right when you plan to deploy 2 or 3 years in the future
[16:04] RLa: tho most of other tech was used for generating and processing various files for the main system
[16:04] deoxxa: wow RLa, 2 years with no release?

[16:05] RLa: deoxxa, that's correct approach
[16:05] t1l7: mansoor: unfortunately my time is somehow limited
[16:05] deoxxa: that's part of the reason we use node, it lets us get stuff to a working state so fast
[16:05] RLa: this project has been always in working condition but not yet released
[16:05] deoxxa: ah
[16:05] RLa: because of the client
[16:05] t1l7: mansoor: or I would offer to partner 
[16:05] deoxxa: mmm, i hear that
[16:06] RLa: and money that flows into development
[16:06] deoxxa: we pretty much have to hold our clients' hands while we're developing stuff
[16:06] mansoor: t1l7: tnx, no biggie 
[16:06] RLa: should money stop flowing it would urge to release it faster
[16:06] deoxxa: we have the freedom to tell them they're wrong, though

[16:08] mansoor: RLa: dude.. if you figure that out you'd be my hero

[16:10] RLa: it's very similar to node
[16:10] RLa: uses evented io
[16:10] RLa: but there are some parts we would like to develop not in c++
[16:11] RLa: node js would serve as glue between http and the app
[16:11] RLa: and would allow to write some functionality, like authentication, on node side
[16:11] djcoin has joined the channel
[16:12] yeysus_ has joined the channel
[16:12] mansoor: RLa: you can write them in JS (using qtWebkit) and connect it to the C++ functions   but i haven't figured out node.js
[16:12] slaskis has joined the channel
[16:12] yeysus_: hi
[16:12] RLa: i already prototyped similar system using java frontend (jetty) which would communicate with the app instances though std in/out
[16:13] RLa: using single-line json protocol
[16:13] t1l7: RLa: do you realize that's somehow dificult to make sense out of your problem without understating a little bit about the app and the stack?
[16:13] t1l7: RLa: put simply, I got lost some sentences ago
[16:13] mansoor: He's prolly making something to do with trading :p
[16:13] RLa: it's not :)
[16:14] yeysus_: the option configure with cpu 64: Is it something you would recommend? Or is it the default option in Linux?
[16:14] RLa: t1l7, it's currently desktop app which contains lot of logics, the idea is to reuse the code as web backend
[16:14] t1l7: RLa: ok, quite a good idea
[16:15] RLa: t1l7, the code was already designed for it and is decoupled from gui
[16:15] t1l7: RLa: so you want to write the logic in Node
[16:15] RLa: t1l7, no, i want to reuse old code
[16:15] t1l7: RLa: and run Node locally when user starts the app
[16:15] RLa: t1l7, no, run it as traditional web app
[16:16] t1l7: so that the qt app would become a thin client?
[16:16] Sir_Rai has joined the channel
[16:16] RLa: no, quite opposite, it would become server
[16:16] RLa: through node
[16:16] _unary has joined the channel
[16:16] t1l7: mind blow time
[16:17] t1l7: so every qt app would act as a server and you would have a distributed server network?
[16:18] RLa: dataflow: browser -> [node -> app instance -> database -> app instance -> node] -> browser <- everything between [] is on server
[16:18] t1l7: ok
[16:18] fomatin has joined the channel
[16:19] t1l7: and {app - databate - app} is what you're calling old code?
[16:19] RLa: node would be something like dispatcher or middleware
[16:19] tjfontaine: so it's like the gdk broadway backend
[16:19] RLa: yes
[16:19] RLa: tjfontaine, it does not have to use old gui code
[16:19] RLa: tho that would be very nice
[16:19] RLa: and probably even possible
[16:20] mattgifford has joined the channel
[16:20] t1l7: and app stands for {gui over business}
[16:20] t1l7: really loose coupled?
[16:21] RLa: in qt you can traverse object tree and map it easily into html
[16:21] RLa: that would make nice idea
[16:21] RLa: but that's not the goal
[16:21] RLa: the goal is to reuse processing logics written in c++ and make it available as web app
[16:21] RLa: or service
[16:21] t1l7: ok
[16:22] t1l7: it seems to me
[16:22] t1l7: that you should replace the GUI with a proper service interface
[16:22] lperrin has joined the channel
[16:22] RLa: yes, and node should help me in that
[16:22] t1l7: providing rpc-like functionality that would be agnostic to the next layer
[16:23] t1l7: the question is that you want a javascript wrapper for QT
[16:23] firebalrog: i would take the javascript
[16:23] RLa: or use it through std io
[16:23] t1l7: am I getting this correctly?
[16:23] RLa: yes
[16:25] t1l7: and, like myself, you fear that this wrapper isn't reaaly available right now
[16:25] t1l7: quite a problem ... 
[16:25] RLa: the ideal would be to use direct linkage (no rpc between qt and node) and qt event loop integrated with node even loop
[16:25] t1l7: couldn't you write a qt based rpc that you could call from JS code
[16:26] t1l7: trough UDP or tcp sockets?
[16:26] RLa: i meant linking object files directly or creating a native extension
[16:27] t1l7: RLa: Yep, that would be great.... but you would need something like pyqt in javascript
[16:27] blueadept has joined the channel
[16:27] t1l7: RLa: and I'm not even sure if the challenge is worth
[16:27] RLa: another possibility are manually written bindings
[16:28] RLa: can you use native pointers in v8/node?
[16:28] t1l7: RLa: that would take a lot of work and won't be reusable at all
[16:29] t1l7: RLa: now you got a question out of my zone of expertise 
[16:29] t1l7: :D
[16:30] mattgifford has joined the channel
[16:31] RLa: if anything else fails then std io communication is still available

[16:36] augustl: are there APIs for force closing a HTTP server, and by that I mean closing it even if there are connections active?
[16:37] t1l7:  kill it?
[16:37] augustl: alternatively, an API to get the connections so I can manually close them. Can only see an API to get the number of connections, not the actual connection objects.
[16:37] augustl: t1l7: that's what I'm asking, how do I kill it
[16:38] augustl: guess I could listen to the "connection" event
[16:38] t1l7: augustl: I believe there isn't
[16:38] RLa: you must also listen disconnect even to remove already disconnected connections
[16:38] t1l7: augustl: killing the http server should be delegated to the supervisor
[16:39] t1l7: augustl: otherwise it could mean suicide :) ba dum tss

[16:49] t1l7: augustl: let's just dive deepper into code and docs

[21:27] astropirate: upstream, what kind of server?
[21:28] upstream: so I want to basically have some form of server push but instead of pushing to a browser from the server I want to push to another server
[21:28] upstream: I figure I could have that other server connect with a http streaming connection to keep it alive...?
[21:29] TheJH: upstream, you can also just use a plain old TCP connection

[21:39] napperjabber_ has joined the channel
[21:39] CarterL has joined the channel
[21:40] upstream: I'd like Server B to connect to Server A and then at some later point have message(s) sent to Server B... is that possible then? without having opened ports on Server B. As far as I know to do RPC or similar you need to have a port open on both servers? sorry if i'm not making any sense!
[21:40] upstream: btw Thanks TheJH for attempting to reason with me, I didn't get any sleep last night so i'm likely out of it :P
[21:41] coolblade: upstream: if no ports open on server b, then server b would have no choice then to poll
[21:41] saesh has joined the channel
[21:41] upstream: coolblade: yeah I thought of that but it's not a good option for me... I was looking at doing like WebSocket if it was Node to Node rather than Node to Browser.
[21:42] coolblade: web sockets still require a socket to be open
[21:43] upstream: coolblade: really? for the main server yeah, but for the client too?
[21:44] coolblade: yeah, as far as I know. what is it your trying to accomplish?
[21:45] redwinter has joined the channel
[21:45] IrishGringo has joined the channel
[21:45] crickeys: I'm using socket.io for some real time visitor stats. When a visitor connects I log the visitor into a mySQL table so that I can query the table and sort things like what page each user is on, etc. When a visitor disconnects, I delete the row from the mySQL table. The problem is, a user can disconnect BEFORE the mySQL table is even updated because the mySQL call is asynch. How would one go about keeping the internally connected so
[21:45] upstream: I want Server A to be able to expose a list of connected "client" servers (Server B as on example) allowing to send messages to each "client" server in an RPC / Push style
[21:46] upstream: but the "client" servers aren't able to expose themselves online through any port
[21:46] wookiehangover: crickeys: google analytics real time (beta) or chartbeat does all of that for you
[21:46] upstream: they are online via IP
[21:46] wookiehangover: and you don't have to re-invent any wheels
[21:47] crickeys: thanks wookie, but that doesn't help :)

[21:48] mattly_ has joined the channel
[21:48] upstream: crickeys: can you use a different DB? CouchDB or Mongo perhaps?

[21:49] upstream: Redis?
[21:49] crickeys: the calls to redis are still asynch though?
[21:49] coolblade: upstream, if they can't expose themselves then you have to poll. theres no way to allow in-bound traffic to a client that has all ports closed, imagine the security holes
[21:49] context: everything is async.
[21:49] Registered: in redis you can set an expiration 
[21:49] Registered: on a value
[21:49] Wizek has joined the channel
[21:49] crickeys: hmm
[21:50] context: crickeys: and whats your point? the mysql table is ALWAYS going to be updated AFTER the client disconnects
[21:50] upstream: coolblade: thanks, that's the problem I was trying to figure out... I was hoping I could use Socket.io to do this, or just plain http streaming

[21:51] Registered: or something 
[21:51] crickeys: 1. client connects, 2. insert beings to insert but doesn't finish, 3. client disconnects and mysql DELETE is fired but INSERT never finished, 4. client RECONNECTS and gets duplicate insert id, etc..
[21:51] crickeys: 2. Insert *begins*...
[21:51] ioparadigm has joined the channel
[21:52] upstream: coolblade: i'm not 100% sure about long polling, my understanding is that you're client just pings a server on a timer and when something is different it grabs it? ... is that about right or way off :)
[21:52] upstream: I should just wikipedia this shit
[21:53] coolblade: upstream: no its more like a hack to force a single http request open to keep pushing packets down to the client for a long time
[21:53] upstream: with HTTP 1.1 can't I just use the keep-alive and never close the connection on the server for that client?
[21:53] redwinter: If I do "var db = require('./models')", which includes ./models/index.js, which includes a series of other files in the dir, how do I get the exports to work so I can do db.Model1?
