[01:29] niftylettuce: ctide: nice :)
[01:29] niftylettuce: ctide: yeah I'm integrating play.js
[01:29] niftylettuce: ctide: (so we can have audio)
[01:30] niftylettuce: ctide: the infinite loop prob is not needed since we need it to run for 3 min 30 seconds
[01:30] ctide: ah, yeah, i just saw your comment about wanting it to run forever so i made it run forever
[01:30] niftylettuce: ctide++
[01:30] v8bot:  niftylettuce has given a beer to ctide. ctide now has 1 beers.
[01:30] niftylettuce: let me see how u did it
[01:30] niftylettuce: why'd you use console.err?
[01:30] ctide: it blocks
[01:31] ctide: you want your output to block so that the process.nexttick isn't called before it's all done
[01:32] abraham has joined the channel
[01:32] gtramont1na: niftylettuce: So you'd like to run the loop once, see how much it took to run and set this value to setInterval?
[01:32] ctide: all the stdout functions are nonblocking
[01:33] ctide: i'd probably just start a timer for 3:30 when you start playing the audio
[01:33] ctide: and then just have that timer display the logo and process.exit

[03:15] WhyNoSocket: Only calling socket.connect once

[03:18] mikeal has joined the channel
[03:19] jbroman: WhyNoSocket: If you're making multiple connections, why not create a net socket each time?

[03:21] xeodox has joined the channel
[03:22] xeodox: How do I get a list of files in a certain directory?
[03:22] WhyNoSocket: Basically, the application is sending data to another node process over TCP. INstead of creating and socket and keeping it open, while the process is running, I would like the connection to be created, then wait until data needs to be sent, connect, and close.
[03:22] Nuck: ACTION goes to program a testkit for his API
[03:23] WhyNoSocket: No need to keep a persistant socket. Does that make sense?
[03:23] jbroman: xeodox: fs.readdir or fs.readdirSync
[03:23] WhyNoSocket: So instead of having a single socket, do I just need to create NEW sockets every data
[03:23] jbroman: WhyNoSocket: Yeah, I would just go ahead and create a new socket each time you want to open a new connection.
[03:24] xeodox: jbroman: how can I get the current directory?
[03:24] jbroman: xeodox: As in, a directory listing of the current directory, or the path to the current directory?
[03:24] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[03:24] xeodox: path to the current directory

[03:26] xeodox: jbroman:  thanks
[03:29] WhyNoSocket: If I call socket.end() in the callback of socket.write() taht will close it right. Do I need to set socket = null to have it ceared out
[03:31] jbroman: WhyNoSocket: Yeah, socket.end() should close the connection. I don't think it will be garbage collected until you remove your reference to it (e.g. by setting the variable to null, or having it go out of scope), but that is likely not a big deal.

[10:06] t4nk458: n00b here: i'm trying to run a node server on port 80 by using http-proxy to proxy port 80 to my node server on port 9000. (just like the first example here: https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy) it worked for a few minutes, then i restarted by server and now i'm told that node can't bind to port 80 without running as root.
[10:07] t4nk458: (i'm almost positive i had this working a few minutes ago, just can't figure out why it won't work now)
[10:07] indutny: t4nk458: you can't run server on low ports on most of linux systems
[10:08] jomoho has joined the channel
[10:09] t4nk458: indutny: right, but i'm somewhat under the impression that node-http-proxy could make this work. if it can't, i'm guessing i have to set the proxy up with nginx outside of my node app?
[10:09] Mrfloyd has joined the channel
[10:10] indutny: t4nk458: nope, you should run "sudo -E node yourapp.js"

[12:27] `3rdEden: klovadis io returns a socket.io instance
[12:28] piscisaureus: DaTa_: you probably don't get the error on the first connection
[12:28] `3rdEden: so either do io = require('socket.io').listen(app);
[12:28] `3rdEden: or instancename = io.listen(app);
[12:28] `3rdEden: and than a instancename.sockets.on
[12:28] DaTa_: yeah, error is on line 49
[12:28] piscisaureus: DaTa_: you are overwriting tcpSocket every time a new connection comes in
[12:28] klovadis: 3rdEden: Thank you very much! facepalming myself : )
[12:29] `3rdEden: klovadis also, there is a dedicated #socket.io channel :)

[12:37] DaTa_: it really works under windows...

[14:14] christkv: @member:bnoordhuis weird that it returns a SlowBuffer as default with v8 3.4.6
[14:15] bnoordhuis: christkv: there is an explanation for that but it's involved and rather boring
[14:16] bnoordhuis: christkv: the gist of it is that fast buffers are linked to a parent buffer and slow buffers aren't

[15:33] systemfault: fumanchu182: It helps, you can't deny it.. PHP became that popular because of how easy you could run it on Windows.
[15:34] t|f: Posix support yes, full posix compatibility (ie all the functions) no. At least as far as it was explained to me.
[15:34] Nuck: systemfault: And I'd love it, since it's getting annoying having to keep WinSCP open all the time

[15:40] bradleymeck_: Ramosa, the article is ancient, and im not sure what you mean
[15:41] tjholowaychuk: Nuck I have one for abstract multipart parsing
[15:41] Nuck: Because the current one is very low quality for the current stuff
[15:41] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: connect-form?

[15:44] Nuck: It's not multipart-encoded
[15:44] Nuck: It's just the raw data lodged in the HTTP body
[15:45] Nuck: It's using the HTML5 File APIs

[15:45] Nuck: taf2: That's what it uses
[15:46] Nuck: It's the RECIEVING that's problematic
[15:46] Nuck: Because it's not x-multipart
[15:46] Nuck: I need to find a way to take the raw body and write it to a file
[15:46] taf2: ACTION thought FormData's whole point was to be multipart...
[15:47] Nuck: taf2: Maybe so, but I've settled on my client-side library :P
[15:47] Nuck: This one provides the lightweight, narrowly-focused purpose I want, plus it has graceful degredation
[15:47] Nuck: (and the JSON response is PERFECT for my API)
[15:47] taf2: cool
[15:48] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: So is there any way to get the RAW body in Express?  I'm thinking the best thing would be to add another type handler for the bodyParser middleware
[15:48] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[15:49] tjholowaychuk: same way as you would with node
[15:49] Nuck: And even if I *do* get teh raw body, I'm not sure how I would go about piping it into a file :/
[15:49] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: Is the body the raw data it recieves?
[15:49] tjholowaychuk: nope
[15:49] Nuck: :/

[16:10] dall: but can i use sessions......cookie without a framework like Express ?
[16:10] tjholowaychuk: podman it's just a shell script

[16:11] podman: tjholowaychuk: works for me if it does what i want :)

[16:11] anno^da has joined the channel
[16:11] isaacs: dall: but express does make a lot of things easier.
[16:11] Nuck: dall: Trust me, things aren't as easy as in PHP :P

[16:12] softdrink: socket.io is brainlessly easy to use. i love it
[16:13] Nuck: isaacs: I'm facing one of the fun lacks that Node has right now.  It's called "file uploads" :P
[16:13] taf2: guys i think this line is wrong, https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/http.js#L697
[16:13] pibi: isaacs: I try to port fuse on nodejs using node-ffi. i see your repo, could you explain where you are blocked?
[16:13] taf2: it shhould be if (this.output.length === 0 && this.connection && this.connection._httpMessage === this) {
[16:13] isaacs: pibi: i'm blocked on not enough time
[16:13] dall: ok, so ejs is good, fasten :P ?
[16:13] taf2: look above in that function how hot is defined
[16:13] isaacs: pibi: i should really write up the next steps for that repo... maybe file issues or something.
[16:13] taf2: this.connection can be null
[16:14] isaacs: pibi: basically, the best way to go is not using node-ffi, but talking directly to the fuse lowlevel utils
[16:14] tjholowaychuk: dall if you like that kind of syntax sure
[16:14] isaacs: pibi: and then, take the stuff that's done in the fuse_loop function, and do it in an ev loop instead.
[16:14] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: Beats the living hell out of HAML and Jade
[16:14] tjholowaychuk: haha
[16:15] pibi: yep, i tried this but i'm too newbie to understand when i can use ev_asyn_send to callback my main thread
[16:15] isaacs: pibi: when you set up the ev loop, also pass in a struct with pointers to methods that get called for each of the fuse functions.  there's a bit of translation that has to be done, because everything isn't named the same, but the goal is to have an object that exactly models the fs util, but in reverse.
[16:15] pibi: with node-ffi it just work
[16:15] dall: tjholowaychuk, yes i used php
[16:15] isaacs: pibi: sure.  but it's gonna be crazy slow.
[16:15] dall: but i heard that mustache is very good
[16:15] dall: (very fast)
[16:15] tjholowaychuk: not the js ones
[16:15] tjholowaychuk: they are pretty slow
[16:16] tjholowaychuk: well, "slow", template engines are rarely an issue

[16:17] pjacobs: can someone help me translate this : {"_id": {$lt : ObjectId("4e07a8762921a15d18000017")}} into a proper mongoose query? 
[16:17] tjholowaychuk: rendering a chunk of html will not be your bottleneck
[16:17] dall: tjholowaychuk, http://jsperf.com/dom-vs-innerhtml-based-templating/111
[16:17] dall: i see mustache is fasten the other
[16:17] tjholowaychuk: you're wasting your time
[16:17] tjholowaychuk: the fastest, is not using a template engine at all :P
[16:17] Nuck: Just pick whatever looks best to you and go
[16:18] tjholowaychuk: enjoy those concats :o
[16:18] pjacobs: I'm thinking the issue is getting an ObjectId.. I've tried DocumentObjectId.fromString(), like I've seen in the mongoose tests, but not luck...
[16:18] podman: tjholowaychuk: does deploy require one to tag each release?
[16:18] dall: tjholowaychuk, i know....but i mean........if we have to use a "template engine" what is the faster?
[16:18] dall: :)
[16:18] tjholowaychuk: podman the tag can be any git ref so a commit sha etc
[16:19] Nuck: dall: Dont' bother
[16:19] tjholowaychuk: but yeah
[16:19] Nuck: The speeds will be minutely different
[16:19] podman: tjholowaychuk: gotcha
[16:19] tjholowaychuk: dall: wasting your time
[16:19] pjacobs: rauchg, didn't you write a good portion of mongoose? Can you help me out?
[16:19] tjholowaychuk: dall it will all be faster than php lol so dont worry about it
[16:19] Nuck: dall: They're  all 10ms.  Now which one looks best.

[17:22] jakeg: Murvin what kind of tech issues?
[17:22] Nuck: Murvin: Me too.  Big technical issue is file uploads, though part of that isn't Node, it's also submitting the file
[17:22] jakeg: we've also had big file upload headaches here
[17:22] Murvin: jakeg:  socket leak.    i have many posts and issues about it already.  
[17:23] lukstr: perl is a nice language... D:

[17:38] Murvin: mhooks: hangup is usually caused by 1) timeout - system socket timeout is 2 minutes   and 2) not enough socket available.      
[17:39] mange has joined the channel
[17:39] AAA_awright: Murvin: base CMS?
[17:39] Murvin: mhooks:  for changing timeout, you have to change it in lib/net.js  and look for socket.setTimeout    change it and the redo the "Make" and "Make install"

[17:40] tuhoojabotti: Nuck: IS IT CAPSLOCK DAY AGAIN?
[17:40] Murvin: mhooks:  for issue 2) - not enough socket available --      in your code, you have to set maxSocket to a larger number.  by default, only 5
[17:41] jakeg: Nuck: did my advice help or another way?
[17:41] mhooks: Murvin: Thank you!
[17:41] AAA_awright: Is it just me or does node-inspector not work on Node.js master?
[17:41] Nuck: jakeg: Yours did, I was using fs.open, I didn't realize I had to fs.opneWritableStream
[17:42] jakeg: woot!
[17:42] Murvin: mhooks, and the maxium sockets in Linux is 1024.   if you want to have a larger number, you have to increase the socket in your OS first.  Then, set the http.agent.maxSocket to a huge number.     There is a leak in socket.  so I suggest you to set it to a large number
[17:42] Murvin: AAA_awright: yes.. any CMS built in node.js?  :)

[18:11] RVS: Murvin: the same. The more function, the more time of call.
[18:12] jslatts has joined the channel
[18:12] RVS: Node.js is async, but not parallel? So, if the one function calculate something in 50 ms, next function will perform only after previous - say 4ms and then 10. Total row of timing will be: 50 54 64.
[18:12] Draggor: Nuck: that doesn't depend on an internal counter? :3
[18:12] Nuck: Maybe just take the first 100 bytes, concatenate with a timestamp and a random number (to prevent problems in images that differ only further down) and MD5 that?
[18:12] Nuck: Draggor: Aye
[18:12] Nuck: Because this is for my temporary storage
[18:13] Nuck: Once it's into permanent storage, it'll be stored that way
[18:13] bradleymeck_: RVS correct, CPU tasks are done serially, IO is async

[18:27] mandric_ has joined the channel
[18:27] Nuck: But the thing is, I don't like the syntax
[18:27] chrisdickinson: only thing i don't like is that now instead of python folks complaining about me using javascript, i've got javascript folks and python folks complaining about my use of javascript and coffeescript, respectively.
[18:28] taf2: that's the pro
[18:28] chrisdickinson: sirganya: ultimately, it speeds you up once you get the hang of it.
[18:28] Nuck: Some people like the syntax, others don't
[18:28] Nuck: chrisdickinson: I disagree, I've got things that speed C-style languages more
[18:28] chrisdickinson: there's a lot of boilerplate in vanilla javascript -- not that i don't like javascript! -- but you don't notice it until you don't have to write it.
[18:29] mandric_ has joined the channel
[18:29] Nuck: chrisdickinson: Why did they repalce the language as a whole?
[18:29] Nuck: Why not just, ya know, extend it?
[18:29] chrisdickinson: Nuck: they didn't.
[18:29] chrisdickinson: there are a few syntactic changes, but it's sugar on top of js. and it feels like JS, writing it.
[18:30] tjholowaychuk: ACTION just wants regexp offset
[18:30] taf2: ACTION use the force luke
[18:30] Nuck: chrisdickinson: I disagree.  There's NOTHING but syntactical changes

[18:30] Nuck: Lack of braces
[18:30] Nuck: There's nothing for me to like there
[18:30] dgathright has joined the channel
[18:30] chrisdickinson: Nuck: shorter functions are good -- 8 letters for "function" is a little silly -- braceless is contentious, ultimately it didn't end up bothering me (though it started out doing so)
[18:31] Nuck: However, the support for default argument values and the inheritance could be nice
[18:31] mandric has joined the channel
[18:31] taf2: ACTION code is all about the texture... pets code
[18:31] chrisdickinson: see, i don't like the inheritance :)
[18:31] sirganya: but no problems with it compiling into something that doesn;t work?
[18:31] chrisdickinson: the iteration is better (much, much better).
[18:31] AAA_awright: I'm getting really bizarre results for util.inspect within Jade... I get either null, undefined, NaN, and key Object.keys() shows the correct properties
[18:31] bradleymeck_: tjholowaychuk, there are many regexp stuff we all want /cry
[18:31] mendel_ has joined the channel
[18:31] chrisdickinson: sirganya: you will run into issues occasionally as you learn how coffeescript works

[18:31] tjholowaychuk: so weird
[18:32] Nuck: Typing "function" doesn't bother me
[18:32] chrisdickinson: but nothing show-stopping. and the code maps fairly cleanly to coffeescript
[18:32] Nuck: The arrows do
[18:32] chrisdickinson: Nuck: why?
[18:32] tjholowaychuk: yeah i prefer function over ->
[18:32] Nuck: chrisdickinson: It's fucking ugly, that's why.

[18:39] AAA_awright: util.inspect is useless
[18:39] Nuck: With a TINY bit of magic
[18:39] chrisdickinson: sirganya: wellll. there's paren-less invocation of functions.
[18:40] caolanm has joined the channel
[18:40] Nuck: Which could very well be implemented without changing the syntax entirely.
[18:40] tjholowaychuk: AAA_awright is that express? what's the render() call look like?
[18:40] chrisdickinson: And then there's nesting those paren-less invocations.
[18:40] Nuck: In fact, I'm tempted to fork CS and tear out the syntax lol
[18:40] Nuck: I should do that some time XD
[18:40] tjholowaychuk: visual ambiguity sucks
[18:40] chrisdickinson: And then there's passing object literals to paren-less invocations -- which just looks like the function on one line, then an indented block of key:val

[18:53] jesusabdullah: Well, you shouldn't necessarily ignore performance if you can *see* something will be a problem later
[18:53] jesusabdullah: but much more important than performance, in a lot of cases, is just being able to understand wth you're doing
[18:53] Illusioneer: jesusabdullah: well if it was only me i'd agree but i'm gonna have other people working with me too
[18:54] jerrysv: premature optimization is the root of all evil
[18:54] Illusioneer: I'd rather code to a preferred style than have to go back and change it should that become an issue

[18:56] jesusabdullah: Bwen: No, the whole point of understanding what you're doing is to be able to do what you *actually* want to do instead of doing something that's kinda like what you want to do but turns out to be buggy

[18:57] jesusabdullah: Illusioneer: express, for example, does have some preconceived notions---I believe it expects a views/ folder, but it's been a while since I've express'd

[18:57] Illusioneer: yes! LOL
[18:57] sirganya: he said:  dont like the JS it compiles down to, it creates a lot of contexts, fragments the JS community into coffeescript modules vs pure JS modules. t would be a differnet story if browsers just exported a bytecode interface that e.g. JS and CS could compile down to
[18:57] softdrink has joined the channel
[18:57] Illusioneer: so basically it's a free-for-all
[18:58] jesusabdullah: indeed
[18:58] Illusioneer: doesn't jibe with my inner-anal-retentive
[18:58] jesusabdullah: One of the strengths of a lightweight system such as express is that you can organize things however you like
[18:58] EyePulp: his fragmentation point has some validity.
[18:58] jesusabdullah: the weakness, of course, being that you have to think about such things
[18:58] jesusabdullah: with great hackerliness comes great responsibility?

[19:03] hydrozen: Hi there. I am *still* trying to get a Flash to connect a node.js socket using XMLSocket. The socket is running on port 9000. I have a flash policy server running on 843 to serve the policy file. Yet, when the Flash is embedded in an HTML document, I always get a #2048 error....   but on my localhost if I had the file to the security exceptions and open the swf file directly in the browser, it does connect to the socket. Anyone has any idea how I could 
[19:03] hydrozen: troubleshoot this? I have NO idea why Flash doesn't want to connect.

[19:39] baudehlo: it's not pretty, but it works.
[19:39] warreng: as a first step, was thinking about building a node.js as the master dns server and then setting up two named/bind servers as slaves... where the named/bind would be the public ones and would just do zone transfers and cache the results

Is it likely they use HTML5 web storage, then just sync every minute or so? And what type of database is the text stored in? I can't think of a database paradigm that fits large blocks or text well, is it likely to be stored on the FS? Thanks for any advice you guys

[21:01] Mook_as: does building master w/ mingw/gcc seem like something that would give me a useful binary? I got something that runs, but can't seem to use npm (due to require('net') failing in net_legacy.js, problems with process.binding('net') - it looks like node_net.cc wasn't built)
[21:01] jerrysv: seanrucker: ouch, but i guess it works
[21:01] dall has joined the channel
[21:01] dall: hello
[21:01] Murvin: tjholowaychuk:  hmmm I wanna do simple authentication (with session).   and my server is running with expressjs.   but just don't know how it works with connect-auth. or if there is simpler way.:)
[21:02] svnlto_ has joined the channel
[21:02] isaacs: Mook_as: no, mingw build doesn't work at the moment for many things.  Use cygwin until you get too rageful, then switch to virtualbox or vmware.
[21:02] dall: guys, how can i update NPM ?
[21:02] isaacs: dall: curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
[21:02] tjholowaychuk: Murvin: I just write my own auth stuff, so I'm not sure what is good as far as "out of the box" type modules
[21:02] Murvin: sudo npm update
[21:02] tjholowaychuk: I know there are a few
[21:02] puffpio_ has joined the channel
[21:02] dall: i have 1.0.9-1
[21:02] isaacs: dall: or, post 1.0.14, `npm update npm -g`
[21:02] isaacs: dall: yeah, do the curl thing
[21:02] Mook_as: isaacs: hah, thanks. I guess I'll stick with running things remotely for a bit, then.
[21:03] isaacs: Mook_as: native windows coming soon-ish (like, this year)
[21:03] dall: but it will replace the previous version?
[21:03] Murvin: tjholowaychuk:  :)  i thought u wrote connect stuff ,  ^^
[21:03] robi42 has joined the channel
[21:03] isaacs: dall: yes.
[21:03] tjholowaychuk: Murvin i did
[21:03] tjholowaychuk: but not that module
[21:03] Murvin: oh
[21:03] dall: isaacs, i can do the command in every directory?
[21:03] dall: it will put npm in the correct dir?
[21:03] tjholowaychuk: a side from stuff like oauth etc I dont find authentication logic is very modular
[21:03] Murvin: tjholowaychuk: let me try. if it works, i let you know. :D
[21:03] isaacs: dall: what do you want to do?
[21:03] isaacs: dall: npm installs itself globally, because it's a cli program
[21:03] isaacs: .
[21:03] dall: globally
[21:04] dall: ok perfect
[21:04] Murvin: dall: it will update everything
[21:04] dall: hmmm
[21:04] dall: It failed
[21:04] Murvin: dall:  if u run ubuntu, i also recommend you to update apt-get   from time to time. :)
[21:04] Murvin: suo
[21:04] Murvin: sudo
[21:05] dall: apt-get ?
[21:05] dall: do i have to isntall npm from there?
[21:05] Murvin: yes
[21:05] Murvin: non
[21:05] Murvin: nono
[21:05] isaacs: dall: if you want to update npm, just install it again.  it's the same process.
[21:05] Murvin: npmjs.org
[21:05] isaacs: dall: it'll update the global one.
[21:05] dall: it failed...
[21:05] dall: i'm reading the log

[21:06] dall: i run it with sudo
[21:06] isaacs: did you really?
[21:06] dall: sudo wget
[21:06] isaacs: or did you just sudo curl | non-sudo sh?
[21:07] dall: *curl
[21:07] isaacs: wget http://npmjs.org/install.sh ; sudo sh install.sh
[21:07] isaacs: or curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh
[21:07] dall: ok
[21:07] Murvin: yeah..   that will work.  especially if you running on ec2.
[21:07] isaacs: the script running bit is that part that has to be sudone

[21:08] zemanel has joined the channel
[21:08] isaacs: npm update is like npm install, but only for things that are out of date.
[21:08] dall: what does mean "-g"
[21:08] isaacs: if you give it a package name, it'll also restrict itself to packages by that name
[21:09] dall: ?
[21:09] isaacs: -g means global
[21:09] dall: ok
[21:09] isaacs: npm help global
[21:09] Murvin: and better to do npm update at least every week. :)
[21:09] eyesUnclouded has joined the channel
[21:09] dall: good
[21:09] dall: npm update
[21:09] dall: but i would like to use it for each project...
[21:09] dall: so i have to do npm update in each project's directory
[21:09] dall: right?
[21:10] dall: it has to update the local /node_modules/
[21:10] jerrysv: isaacs: did you ever fix that semver ~v0.4.8 bug?
[21:11] dall: no?
[21:11] Prometheus: dall: yes
[21:11] isaacs: jerrysv: nope, guess not

[21:11] Prometheus: dall: also, nvm is nice :)
[21:11] jerrysv: heh, ok
[21:11] dall: nvm ?
[21:11] isaacs: dall: yes
[21:11] isaacs: dall: you'd have to update in each project.
[21:12] dall: ok
[21:12] isaacs: dall: or, you can use npm link, and then global updates will affect the projects that link in those packages.
[21:12] dall: so npm update on the project's dir will update the packages locally....if i run npm update -g will update the packages globally
[21:12] dall: ah ok
[21:12] isaacs: dall: "global" ==> "in /usr/local/"
[21:13] isaacs: but otherwise the global space is basically the same sort of thing as the local space.
[21:13] isaacs: except that executables end up in your PATH
[21:13] dall: good

[21:16] tjholowaychuk: ah well i wrote cluster but i have no clue what connect-cluster is

[21:21] Murvin: expressjs.com, click "guide" button

[21:25] dall: guys i have installed socket.io and express.... not to install EJS i have to go to myproject/node_modules/express/ and do nom install ejs ?
[21:25] Murvin: tjholowaychuk:  ok.. let me try.. because i used another package now, but it will throw socket error if there are still requests not done.  
[21:25] dall: or i can do it on the main dir?
[21:26] tjholowaychuk: dall main dir should be fine
[21:27] rpj8 has joined the channel
[21:27] dall: tjholowaychuk, i told you that because i see another /node_modules/ inside myproj/node_modules/express/
[21:27] dall: why?
[21:28] tjholowaychuk: because that's how npm works
[21:28] isaacs: dall: dependencies are nested
[21:28] isaacs: dall: npm ls
[21:28] smcguinness has joined the channel
[21:29] dall: isaacs, yes.....so now i have to install ejs i will use it with express so in the main dir or inside /express/node_modules/ ?
[21:30] Murvin: can i do that:   express.createServer(connect.router( myRouter) );  or   there is express.router( ... ) ?
[21:30] tjholowaychuk: Murvin best to use app.get() etc directly
[21:30] tjholowaychuk: connect's router will be gone (or greatly simplified) in the future

[21:50] Murvin: hmmm isn't that app.get already do the routing?
[21:51] tjholowaychuk: yeah, but the router is implemented as middleware
[21:51] tjholowaychuk: so you can position it above/below other middleware in your config
[21:51] tjholowaychuk: if you want
[21:51] Murvin: oh
[21:51] tjholowaychuk: if you leave it out then it will auto-use() the router
[21:52] Murvin: so, if i leave it , then app.get will be used in top level.  and i can't catch error by express.errorHandler?
[21:52] Murvin: OOOO
[21:52] Murvin: get it

[22:48] felixge: mikeal: http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/ -> An origin server is the location of the definitive version of your object. This could be another Amazon Web Service – Amazon S3 bucket, Amazon EC2 instance – or this could be your own origin server.
[22:48] bnoordhuis: voodootikigod: what kind of fd are you passing it?
[22:49] felixge: mikeal: they only supported S3 in the beginning IIRC, but AFAIK that is no longer the case
[22:49] voodootikigod: bnoorduis: https://github.com/voodootikigod/node-serialport/blob/master/serialport_native/serialport_native.cc#L90
[22:49] mikeal: right, there are no docs on custom origin server that i can find

[22:51] bnoordhuis: that's always been a problem with linux drivers :-/
[22:52] voodootikigod: i would believe
[22:52] voodootikigod: except
[22:52] voodootikigod: it was working on my machine
[22:52] sh1mmer: hello
[22:52] voodootikigod: i recompiled
[22:52] voodootikigod: same system
[22:52] voodootikigod: same version
[22:52] voodootikigod: and it worked
[22:52] voodootikigod: so its not the driver
[22:52] voodootikigod: recompiled again
[22:52] voodootikigod: and doesnt work
[22:52] voodootikigod: so its somehting funky

[23:05] isaacs: lady gaga is awesome for coding
[23:06] Murvin: Code this way.. lol
[23:06] isaacs: Nuck: gogol bordello?
[23:06] jesusabdullah: gogol bordello is fun
[23:06] Nuck: isaacs: Of course :P
[23:06] jerrysv: code like an egyptian?
[23:06] Nuck: ACTION <3 Gogol Bordello
[23:07] dall: guys if i do: res.render('index', { test: "Text Text Text Text Text" });     it will load index.ejs and render the page with that object.....but, if i have a big object (many properties) how can i get it from a file ? or do i have to put the obhect on the index.ejs ? (but i think in the manner it will not cached
[23:07] dall: what is the better manner?
[23:07] iffy|x200 has joined the channel
[23:07] Nuck: If I wanted to represent an array of objects in x-form-encoded, how would I do this?
[23:08] Murvin: what is your concern of not passign the big object?
[23:08] Corren has joined the channel
[23:08] isaacs: Nuck: my favorite coding mix lately is gogol bordello and of montreal on random
[23:09] dall: Murvin, if i have a lot of pages the main js file (app.js) will be too big...i would like to create index.ejs (html) and something like index.obj (if i have a big object)
[23:09] Murvin: gogol bordello.  :)  
[23:09] dall: wrong?
[23:09] Nuck: isaacs: I mostly blast Gogol Bordello mid-day
[23:09] drudge: mape: ping
[23:09] Nuck: It's good to keep you going :P
[23:10] Nuck: I just scroll around my iPod, looking for upbeat shit, and Gogol Bordello is one of the things I choose a lot.
[23:10] Murvin: dall:  the problem isn't the html, is that you have many app.get('/ ') and you need to organize it, right?
[23:11] drudge: https://github.com/mape/node-scraper do the examples work for anyone?
[23:11] dall: Murvin, yes surelly...i have to organize them.....sure
[23:11] c4milo1 has joined the channel
[23:12] dall: but the question is can i load the object from another file if this object is too big?
[23:12] dall: and if it possible then if i load the object it will be cached ?
[23:12] tjholowaychuk: dall what is it that you are trying to display?...  what are these big chunks of text?
[23:12] mikeal has joined the channel
[23:13] dall: tjholowaychuk, i don't have it at the moment i only would like to know how can i manage this kind of necessity
[23:13] tjholowaychuk: doing something without motivation
[23:13] tjholowaychuk: doesnt make sense
[23:13] tjholowaychuk: and makes it hard to answer your questions
[23:14] dall: tjholowaychuk, because i think if the object is too long it makes the code unredable
[23:14] tjholowaychuk: yes but in practice you wouldnt do that
[23:14] tjholowaychuk: static content would be in a template, dynamic would be from a database query
[23:15] Murvin: dall:  sorry... can't really see the problem of the relationship between the object u gonna load, and the code readibility. hmm
[23:15] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: I can't do an object in x-form-encoded, can I?
[23:16] Nuck: :/
[23:16] dall: if i do it:   res.render('index', { test: "Text Text Text Text Text" });
[23:16] sely has joined the channel
[23:16] dall: will it be cached?
[23:16] tjholowaychuk: Nuck yeah, user[name]=tj&user[email]=whatever
[23:16] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: Can I embed an object in an array?
[23:16] dall: i think it will be "unredable"
[23:16] tjholowaychuk: dall you're asking about issues that dont exist lol work on your app first and come up with issues
[23:17] dall: issues ?
[23:17] dall: ok no problem tjholowaychuk 
[23:17] Murvin: dall: usually, in this case, your text will be from DB.. instead of hard coding it. right?
[23:17] Nuck: dall: Stop worrying, tjholowaychuk already did that for you when he developed Express.
[23:17] Murvin: dall:  and for caching.  I am not 100% sure but i guess it will be cached.
[23:17] dall: Murvin, yes
[23:18] tjholowaychuk: coming up with a problem before you actually encounter it, is really weird
[23:18] jeroen| has joined the channel
[23:18] dall: ok guys, thank you...i know i asked a lot of questions...sorry about that, you are very available :)
[23:18] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: It's that old form of development, what's it called?  The thing before agile.
[23:18] Nuck: :P
[23:19] Nuck: Can this be turned into x-form-encoded, and if so, how?
[23:19] Nuck: {'artists' : [ { 'name' : 'Nuck', 'role' : 'Programmer' }, { 'name' : 'tlejeck', 'role' : 'Artist' } ] }
[23:20] Wizek_ has joined the channel
[23:20] Nuck: Essentially, I want "artists[][name]=Nuck" kidna thing
[23:20] xerox: there's a programmer inside your artists
[23:20] tjholowaychuk: Nuck why not use json?
[23:20] Nuck: xerox: I know, I just threw a couple of roles, the first two that popped into my head :P
[23:20] Murvin: tjholowaychuk:  in the express auth/app.js example  there is res.redirect('back')   is the 'back' actually saying that go back to where it is from?
[23:20] Murvin: or a page called "back".
[23:20] tjholowaychuk: Murvin yeah back will check for Referrer/Referer
[23:21] tjholowaychuk: you can map custom redirection strings
[23:21] tjholowaychuk: but back/home are defaults
[23:21] Murvin: ok.  that's useful.
[23:21] dall: guys, thank you all! you help is very appreciable...........i have to go too late 01:21 am, thank you see you soon
[23:21] tjholowaychuk: i dont think anyone uses them but me haha
[23:21] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: Meh, that's a valid point... I just dunno how good support for json-form-encoding is...
[23:21] Nuck: On other clients, that is
[23:21] Nuck: In XHR, it's easy
[23:22] Nuck: But IDK about Obj-C and such

[23:23] tjholowaychuk: there's quite a few small things i dont think anyone really uses/knows, because people often glance through the docs and when they come across a new problem they dont look back
[23:23] tjholowaychuk: they just rebuild it or do something else
[23:24] tjholowaychuk: and some things i just dont even have documented well at all
[23:24] Murvin: haha..  I'm looking at every single word in the doc. lol   no spelling error yet. :P
