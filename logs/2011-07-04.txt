[01:19] tbranyen: steveklabnik: nope
[01:19] tbranyen: steveklabnik: nodejs is in community now :)
[01:19] steveklabnik: hmmm
[01:19] steveklabnik: why doesnt pacman see it then?
[01:19] tbranyen: sudo pacman -S nodejs
[01:19] tim_smart: steveklabnik: compile from source is recommended in most situations
[01:19] tbranyen: do you have the community repo added and sync'd?
[01:20] tbranyen: tim_smart: not in arch

[01:21] tbranyen: yeah its great that its there

[01:25] tbranyen: did you forget sudo?
[01:25] steveklabnik: i think so.
[01:26] steveklabnik: let's put it this way, i didnt type sudo, i just copy/pasted the shell script.
[01:26] tbranyen: yeah it installs to directories that you shouldn't have perms to, by default
[01:26] tbranyen: do curl ... | sudo sh

[02:02] te-brian: SubStack: files and results
[02:05] Nican: I would like to know more about that too.
[02:05] SubStack: interesting
[02:05] te-brian: If I had apache installed I'd toss that in there
[02:05] te-brian: but i dont
[02:06] te-brian: I suppose I can.. not hard lol
[02:07] SubStack: where node really shines is if you've got some i/o operation that takes ages and a lot of concurrent connections
[02:07] te-brian: heres my first guess ... nginx multi-threads better?
[02:07] te-brian: So as you say.. with 100% utilization it is prob faster... but toss in some db connections as such and then the results shoudl tip?
[02:07] AvianFlu: are you testing node behind nginx?
[02:07] te-brian: AvianFlu: No (asfaik) just hitting the port directly
[02:08] AvianFlu: hmmm
[02:08] Lorentz: devrim: It should tip, yes.
[02:08] Lorentz: I'd serve static files over nginx anyway.
[02:08] te-brian: Because.. for example I have 5 nginx workers in ps aux right now... 
[02:08] SubStack: I would guess that it would tip but results trump what I would suppose :p
[02:08] te-brian: Where as only one node thread.. right?
[02:09] SubStack: te-brian: node has 1 javascript thread but lots of threads behind the scenes in c++ land
[02:09] te-brian: SubStack: Ahhh.. that part has always been a mystery to me.
[02:10] anatoo has joined the channel
[02:10] SubStack: since some c apis are just blocking and there's no way around it
[02:10] bnoordhuis: what SubStack said and this:
[02:10] bnoordhuis: file i/o can't be done reliably in an async manner
[02:10] bnoordhuis: so it's delegated to the thread pool
[02:10] te-brian: Intersting.. with -c 1  the results look quite different
[02:11] te-brian: straight html still wins with 2216 req/sec
[02:11] te-brian: Then node with 1300 req/sec
[02:11] te-brian: and php is last with 900 req/sec
[02:12] SubStack: php is plenty fast
[02:12] SubStack: but it's php
[02:12] SubStack: so there's thtat
[02:12] AvianFlu: php will always have that funny smell to it regardless
[02:12] te-brian: Heh
[02:13] SubStack: of course javascript has its warts too but I can look past those more easily
[02:13] AvianFlu: warts are one thing
[02:13] te-brian: I'm finally learning proper php OOP ... though I already knew prototypes pretty well .. but it will be sad to leave true Classes behind
[02:13] AvianFlu: a permanent stench is quite another
[02:13] SubStack: ACTION doesn't care much for classes
[02:13] te-brian: Though I guess things like backbone can help in that regard
[02:14] SubStack: of course I learned javascript first when I was 11
[02:14] AvianFlu: functional programming FTW
[02:14] te-brian: I'm easily swayed by public opinion lol .. and most of my circle likes objects

[02:36] jesusabdullah: and, I mean, I do want to help
[02:36] jesusabdullah: Oh, I see what you mean
[02:37] jesusabdullah: You have something like, for(i=0;i<10;i++) { cb(); } right?
[02:37] jesusabdullah: Try something like, for(i=0;i<10;i++) { (function(i) { cb(); })(i); }
[02:38] jesusabdullah: What you basically do is trap your particular i into a closure, inside which your callback can access from outside its own scope. Make sense?
[02:39] jesusabdullah: Kinda-sorta?
[02:41] yoav1: yes, but what if the callback function already expects an object from the event like an http response it's {options}, function(res) {})
[02:43] jesusabdullah: a) I don't know how that changes anything. b) You still haven't showed me your particular piece of code.
[02:43] jesusabdullah: Please, just go to gist.github.com and paste your particular piece of code so I can stop speaking in generalities

[04:03] tbranyen: i have a setup script that npm install's everything in my package.json dependancies
[04:03] muk_mb: tbranyen: so they're per-project, but git-ignored?
[04:03] tbranyen: yup
[04:03] rhdoenges: or just add the projects as submodules
[04:03] tbranyen: why bother, when npm works fine?
[04:04] tbranyen: and npm will handle dependancies and all that snazzy jazz
[04:04] rhdoenges: speaking of snazzy jazz, there is now an `npm submodule` command in the npm git
[04:04] rhdoenges: it installs your dependencies as git submodules in node_modules/
[04:05] rhdoenges: but it's really new, so it's kinda flakey atm.
[04:05] tbranyen: seems like you would have a specific use case to need something like that
[04:05] tbranyen: i dunno what that would be
[04:05] rhdoenges: I like it, just cuz.

[14:10] cryptix: sigh... why cant i get the crypto module to place nice with files encrypted by the openssl cli tool?
[14:10] marcello3d: yea. sadly
[14:10] marcello3d: duostack sucks :)
[14:10] marcello3d: http://2.no.de/ here's the no.de version, but they suck to, so it goes down a lot
[14:10] marcello3d: *too
[14:10] marcello3d: (just restarted it now, so all the data is outdated)
[14:11] jetienne: i think stagas wrote something like that
[14:11] jetienne: stagas: are you around ? you had a github + score stuff no ?
[14:11] marcello3d: eirikb: you seem to be missing some modules, thoguh?
[14:11] maushu has joined the channel
[14:11] marcello3d: oh, it's just sorted differently
[14:11] eirikb: marcello3d: No idea. I had 2400 when I used require('npm')... but then I used registry instead and god 1800
[14:12] eirikb: got*
[14:12] marcello3d: shrug
[14:12] marcello3d: 2 day hack :)
[14:13] eirikb: Nipster, or yours?
[14:13] marcello3d: mine
[14:13] marcello3d: feel free to rip out anything useful: https://github.com/marcello3d/nithub
[14:13] eirikb: Oh
[14:14] jetienne: http://hwknd.com/ from stagas but it appears offline
[14:14] marcello3d: what's with node servers not being able to stay up? :)
[14:14] jetienne: https://github.com/stagas/hwknd.com on github too :)
[14:14] eirikb: I can probably host anywhere, don't need node really
[14:15] jetienne: eirikb: how do you query github ? no need of auth ?
[14:15] eirikb: jetienne: No need for auth
[14:15] eirikb: First I used v2, but now I use v3
[14:16] eirikb: jetienne: This does the job: https://github.com/eirikb/nipster/blob/master/node_modules/rated.js
[14:16] jetienne: i like pure browser stuff, it is so easy to host
[14:16] marcello3d: ah, you don't use a database?
[14:16] eirikb: Well I render with jade now, but using pure JSON should do the exact same result
[14:16] eirikb: marcello3d: No need for that
[14:17] marcello3d: I was tired of waiting 20 minutes every time I started the app for it to be useful :)
[14:17] eirikb: It uses 1 second to start
[14:17] marcello3d: you query registry and github in 1 second?
[14:18] eirikb: No, I query registry in 1 second. Then I load the packages from packages.json and compare
[14:18] marcello3d: oh I see, you save/load a big json file
[14:19] eirikb: Yep. Good old serialization. Don't need anything more fancy. I can without any issues store everything in RAM, and I never need any querys
[14:19] marcello3d: yea
[14:19] Vladimir1 has joined the channel
[14:20] eirikb: So if I want to host this statically I could just load the .json with ajax and load it into the datatables-plugin as pure JSON
[14:20] devrim has joined the channel
[14:20] marcello3d: right
[14:20] eirikb: Hell, then I could even throw it out on a github-pages. And it would be even smaller to load (if I strip away unwanted properties)
[14:21] marcello3d: how would you keep it up to date?
[14:21] robi42 has joined the channel
[14:21] eirikb: How would you keep it up to date in any other case?
[14:22] eirikb: I could have a cron that updates against the github API once every second day or so, then automatically push to gh-pages

[14:26] eirikb: But having it statically on github would probably be nice
[14:26] marcello3d: probably why my site is down ;)
[14:26] eirikb: :D
[14:26] marcello3d: they sent me an email about it a few months back but I couldn't be bothered, ya know?
[14:26] eirikb: Well I have to go now. Awesome coming here to figure out my idea have been done long ago :/   Oh well. Bye 
[14:26] marcello3d: sorry :)
[14:26] marcello3d: it's a good idea
[14:26] eirikb: Haha it's ok.
[14:26] marcello3d: there is at least one other implementation, too

[17:43] Kingdutch: I've never seen irssi tbh
[17:43] jesusabdullah: even though it SHOULD be because it's obviously the best irc client
[17:43] Kingdutch: Used to use mIRC
[17:43] Kingdutch: Now on x-caht
[17:43] Kingdutch: x-chat*
[17:43] Kingdutch: which takes up a lot less screen space
[17:43] sechrist: I like the entire concept of irssi, except I actually like more color depth than terminals provide.. and thumbnails.
[17:43] jesusabdullah: Give it a shot, Kingdutch. It's nifty.
[17:43] systemfault: irssi alone is meh at best.
[17:43] jesusabdullah: sechrist: BLOAT

[17:44] Kingdutch: woa irssi actually calls itself the client of the future
[17:44] Kingdutch: lol
[17:44] sechrist: can I have something to where I can click a link in irssi and an x-forwarded window of the image pops up?
[17:44] Kingdutch: I should write an IRC client in node.js

[17:44] Kingdutch: just for shiz ń giggle
[17:44] systemfault: jesusabdullah: irssi shines with screen and ssh imho

[17:44] jesusabdullah: Oh, yeah, that's true
[17:44] systemfault: jesusabdullah: Alone.. it's.. just a console client, no real advantage to xchat.
[17:44] sechrist: Wait, is anybody doing graphical enhancements of irssi with x-forwarding?
[17:44] jesusabdullah: well, except that it's more awesome

[17:55] Kingdutch: With PHP at the moment we're moving to frameworks that implement OOP patterns and ways of working (think codeigniter, kohana etc.)
[17:56] Kingdutch: Then we're using Javascript for the interactivity trying to cater to both search engines and people using htel atest browsers
[17:56] chjj: ok, well php is wrong, and php does oo wrong

[17:57] seivan has joined the channel
[17:57] Kingdutch: Anyway, euh we shouldn't be having to use nifty tricks to seperate logic from views and to be able to use OOP

[17:57] tjholowaychuk: \php\is\sweet
[17:57] Kingdutch: I think it's time for something new that by default enforces the separation of view and controller
[17:58] sechrist: (a simple reference sweep GC, but a GC nonetheless!)
[17:58] Kingdutch: And lets us use OOP to easily extend and overwrite certain functions
[17:58] sechrist: Kingdutch: express

[18:01] hij1nx has joined the channel
[18:01] Kingdutch: Well, jesusabdullah My problem with express is the fact that I need to be concerned with routes etc.
[18:01] Kingdutch: I think 
[18:01] jesusabdullah: How else are you going to do that sort of thing?
[18:01] tjholowaychuk: Drupal
[18:01] chjj: concerned with routes?
[18:01] towski has joined the channel
[18:02] tjholowaychuk: Kingdutch if you want routes to be more like rails as far as config goes, you can abstract and do: app.get('/user/:id', user.show)
[18:02] tjholowaychuk: etc
[18:02] jesusabdullah: Also: Express has these features, but you can use it just like connect really, without invoking any of the extra toys, if you wish
[18:02] Kingdutch: http://pastebin.com/NHgjGdkQ
[18:02] Kingdutch: I want that to be possible
[18:02] Kingdutch: Or something along those lines
[18:03] Kingdutch: Where the default JS function alert would be called
[18:03] tjholowaychuk: rails tried that
[18:03] sivy has joined the channel
[18:03] tjholowaychuk: and it failed
[18:03] tjholowaychuk: let js be js
[18:03] Kingdutch: And if not available a page would be loaded with the alert displayed in some other way
[18:04] Kingdutch: Which means I just concern myself with the behaviour and the program (or server if you will) concerns itself with whether or not the client has JS and how to deliver that functionality
[18:05] robertfw has joined the channel
[18:05] jesusabdullah: I don't think that's quite the right way to do something like that, though I understand some of the motivations
[18:06] Kingdutch: Well that's my biggest problem at the moment
[18:06] tbassetto has joined the channel
[18:06] Kingdutch: I know what I want
[18:06] Kingdutch: Just not how to formulate it
[18:06] jesusabdullah: You *may* find browserify interesting, then. It lets you use npm modules in the browser
[18:06] Kingdutch: Plus, it doesn't quite work with html
[18:06] AvianFlu: browserify ftw
[18:07] tjholowaychuk: reality is css+html+js are _very_ coupled, so for now you have to live with that
[18:07] jesusabdullah: You could probably *build* something like that with, say, dnode, browserify and/or harmony proxies
[18:07] jesusabdullah: It's true, you can't really get around the fact that they're kinda entangled
[18:07] Kingdutch: well thatd mess up search engines that dont support js

[18:09] alessio_alex has joined the channel
[18:09] jesusabdullah: I'd worry more about the features that make it "what you want" first, especially with regards to API, and then try to take care of issues like automatic noscript fallbacks, etc.
[18:09] adambeynon has joined the channel
[18:09] Kingdutch: That'd be a good approach
[18:09] tjholowaychuk: Kingdutch that's a lot of work, even 8 year old frameworks like drupal still struggle with that
[18:09] Kingdutch: But the write once deploy for everyone is pretty much a core feature
[18:09] Kingdutch: tjholowaychuk: That's because frameworks like drupal try to do stuff like that using PHP
[18:10] Kingdutch: which was never designed for the stuff they're trying to pull-off
[18:10] tjholowaychuk: im not sure php was ever designed
[18:10] Aria: It really wasn't. Totally organic, and it shows.
[18:10] Kingdutch: My point exactly
[18:10] chjj: php wasnt designed, things were just added, and added, and added
[18:10] AvianFlu: it was originally a language for hobbyists, hence many problems making it THE LANGUAGE
[18:11] jesusabdullah: Even if the language sucks, though, I feel like a "good" coder comfortable with the language should be able to work around these problems
[18:11] jesusabdullah: in the case of php at least
[18:11] Kingdutch: Anyway if you'd write more abstract code like the little hello world I pasted
[18:11] stepheneb has joined the channel

[18:18] jesusabdullah: Squax: I'm no socket.io expert, but I can suggest this: What kinda errors are you seeing in the javascript console?
[18:18] jesusabdullah: Actually, I saw newer versions of IE have a pretty nice js console
[18:18] jesusabdullah: shitty js, nice console
[18:19] chjj: ie doesnt give errors or stack traces, they jsut say, "cannot access property of null, or undefined, or zero, or..string? were not really sure"

[18:28] yhahn has joined the channel
[18:28] chjj: so is `this` a pointer or is `->` how you access any member?
[18:28] jesusabdullah: I do wonder, though, if you could write a similar edsl in js instead of having to write a new language
[18:28] chjj: because if its the latter, i dont like!
[18:28] Squax: ugh, turns out, it can connect using the public dns alright, but not by the same ip as the proxy
[18:29] jesusabdullah: chjj: I assumed it was the latter.
[18:29] chjj: yeah me too
[18:29] jesusabdullah: Have you ever looked at R code?
[18:29] Kingdutch: I assumed the same
[18:29] jesusabdullah: I think R uses -> to access members
[18:29] Kingdutch: but seeing as I'm pretty much just looking int owhat syntax should be used
[18:29] Kingdutch: That's subject to change
[18:29] Kingdutch: Hence why I asked for comments
[18:29] jesusabdullah: but it gets crazier because in R, variable.names.look.like.this
[18:30] Kingdutch: I don't like HTML too much, I want HBOX and VBOX with an OOP way to define behaviour
[18:30] jesusabdullah: Kingdutch: Mine would be to try and write an edsl before you went all out with a totally new syntax
[18:30] Kingdutch: Which is what I want to accomplish with this 'new' 'language'

[18:32] jesusabdullah: Kingdutch: dsl is "domain specific language," meaning it's built with a specific purpose in mind
[18:32] jesusabdullah: For example, R is a DSL for statistical computation
[18:32] jesusabdullah: matlab is a DSL for linear algebra
[18:32] jesusabdullah: and so on
[18:32] Kingdutch: Right
[18:33] Kingdutch: but in order to know what it should look like wouldn't you need like a sample program?
[18:33] jtsnow has joined the channel
[18:33] jesusabdullah: an EDSL is an "embedded DSL" meaning that it's implemented using the tools in a given general purpose language instead of inventing its own parser
[18:33] jesusabdullah: and is "embedded" in another language runtime
[18:33] Kingdutch: Ah
[18:33] jesusabdullah: Often, these DSLs use method chains to do what they want, as an example

[18:34] jesusabdullah: More like, write some javascript until you have some js constructs that more or less do what you want
[18:35] jesusabdullah: You're limited by valid javascript syntax, but I think js's syntax is flexible enough that you can do interesting things

[18:38] Kingdutch: C++ is cool
[18:38] Kingdutch: I'm no fan of boost
[18:38] jesusabdullah: That's what the C stands for right?? "cool"?
[18:38] systemfault: A lot of the good things in boost were brought to C++0x
[18:38] Kingdutch: One of the causes of my library trauma
[18:38] jesusabdullah: So, c++ is cool++
[18:39] jesusabdullah: I'd imagine that boost is both good and bad
[18:39] Kingdutch: If I ned 1 thing from boost you usually need more
[18:39] Kingdutch: =|
[18:39] Kingdutch: It does have some nice shortcuts in there though
[18:39] Kingdutch: To avoid all the platform dependant socket stuff e.g.
[18:39] systemfault: ASIO.. right
[18:39] jesusabdullah: My impression is that c++ is the sort of thing where with some of these libraries, you end up having to embrace the whole thing because of how it "wrangles in" the underlying language
[18:40] jesusabdullah: Like, you just want the sweet boots but end up with the whole cowboy
[18:40] systemfault: :P
[18:40] Kingdutch: Ghehe
[18:40] Kingdutch: That's not C++ though

[18:43] chjj: lol
[18:43] tjholowaychuk: yeah i'll be pissed if/when we get that

[18:46] chjj: i tried to write some dom traversal methods like that once: el['>']('footer')[' ']('a'), then i dropped it 2 seconds later cause it looked like shit
[18:46] jesusabdullah: XD
[18:46] jesusabdullah: yeah
[18:46] jesusabdullah: Maybe write another function: traverse(el,'>','footer',' ','a')
[18:47] jesusabdullah: Not sure if that's better ;)
[18:47] chjj: well at that point ill just write a selector engine

[18:48] jesusabdullah: Yeah, that stuff's annoying

[18:51] systemfault: Mine was.. basic on a TRS-80 :P
[18:51] jesusabdullah: nobody in the class was ready for everything in java
[18:51] jesusabdullah: so we learned the bare basics
[18:51] robertfw: qbasic on some 386 dos

[18:52] AvianFlu: yeah, I found a book on the BASIC interpreter before I turned on the comp, my first code ever was totally an infinite loop :P
[18:52] jesusabdullah: Using something like ruby, python, javascript, or, well, anything you can just write console.log('hiworld') and have it run
[18:52] jesusabdullah: would've been a lot better
[18:53] AvianFlu: even C has easier IO than java
[18:53] blkcat: java, eugh.
[18:53] chjj: it would be interesting to see cs courses start at the lowest level and work their way up
[18:53] chjj: start with raw op codes, move up to assembly, then c, etc
[18:53] systemfault: Java has a million way to do IO..
[18:53] AvianFlu: my favorite 'hello world' is definitely x86 asm, I think it was ten lines XD
[18:54] jesusabdullah: Ugh
[18:54] jesusabdullah: that'd be painful
[18:54] GicBash: i'm agree with you, AvianFlu, but java is crossplatform
[18:54] jesusabdullah: So's javascript
[18:54] jesusabdullah: and python
[18:54] jesusabdullah: and ruby
[18:54] muk_mb1: crossplatform = meh
[18:54] GicBash: everything has good and bad side
[18:54] AvianFlu: oh yeah, VM magic is always cool
[18:54] systemfault: GicBash: In reality, it has never really been an advantage.
[18:54] systemfault: Even Sun/Oracle stopped marketing Java for being crossplatform..
[18:55] GicBash: systemfault: what do you mean
[18:55] leonh has joined the channel
[18:55] jesusabdullah: I think it's an advantage, just not as big of one as people thought
[18:55] systemfault: GicBash: I mean that being crossplatform is not really a selling point for Java.
[18:55] jesusabdullah: because it's very difficult to make something truly "write once, run everywhere"
[18:55] lukstr: C is crossplatform too :)
[18:55] jesusabdullah: also, that^^ Most languages are "crossplatform" to a degree
[18:56] systemfault: lukstr: You can't do anything interesting with C alone though :/
[18:56] GicBash: systemfault: yeah i'm agree with you but Java is a better than nothing
[18:56] lukstr: systemfault: wat
[18:56] jesusabdullah: I think java's VM/crossplatformness was more novel when it came out
[18:56] systemfault: lukstr: To do anything interesting, you need to interact with the OS.

[18:57] balaa has joined the channel

[18:59] lukstr: there are standard implementations for many things in C like there are in the JVM for each platform.

[19:00] GicBash: now it's time for web 2.0 army: HTML5&CSS3&Javascript@server
[19:00] systemfault: GicBash: Never said that java is not useful, Java(The JVM) is super fast.

[19:01] systemfault: GicBash: The only thing that makes me cry about Java is how they literally fucked it with how they implemented generics.
[19:01] systemfault: Type erasure was the worst idea EVER.
[19:01] GicBash: systemfault:so do i
[19:01] bnoordhuis: backwards compatibility
[19:02] bnoordhuis: can't break all that wonderful 1.3. and 1.4 code
[19:02] systemfault: bnoordhuis: Of course, we understand that :(
[19:02] jesusabdullah: generics?

[19:08] lukstr: it is definitely a swiss army knife of languages, but that comes with many costs
[19:08] jesusabdullah: from what I know
[19:08] systemfault: Java has the tooling.. seriously.
[19:09] bnoordhuis: jesusabdullah: you'd be amazed at the amount of python code out there
[19:09] systemfault: Tons of refactoring tools, IDEs that actually works... etc.
[19:09] jesusabdullah: bnoordhuis: Oh, I know about the python code. It's how I got into python!
[19:09] lukstr: and I don't think there exists an area of application that it dominates in. There will always be a better more specific tool
[19:09] GicBash: what do you mean under "science code"
[19:09] jesusabdullah: bnoordhuis: but the python code usually does the less intense stuff

[19:30] marcello3d: it was a distraction! ambush!

[19:34] tjholowaychuk: indutny runs your production configuration, but the only core changes is the template caching
[19:34] indutny: tjholowaychuk: ah
[19:34] pquerna: right, and maybe template caching is what is slowing him down... but... 320 does seem low.
[19:34] te-brian: pquerna: So production jumps it up to 1156 .. still notably slower ..but... understandably so I think
[19:34] indutny: thanks
[19:34] te-brian: pquerna: I assume the main slow-down in dev is logging?
[19:34] pquerna: still seems low, but honestly i've not tried to optimize my own express app
[19:34] chjj: pquerna, if template caching isnt enabled, yeah, expect it to be slow

[19:35] indutny: NODE_ENV=production?
[19:35] pquerna: (most of mine are talking to a cassandra cluster across 5 regions..so... express... anyways)
[19:35] te-brian: pquerna: I should note that my "Hello World" app is using cluster.   I assume with express's pids dir that it is multi-threaded?
[19:35] chjj: that means the template engine is parsing and compiling templates every request, very slow
[19:36] marcello3d: is NODE_ENV a convention deal, or does it affect node itself?

[19:37] tjholowaychuk: beats setting like 15 env vars
[19:37] tjholowaychuk: per project
[19:38] te-brian: tjholowaychuk: Just getting into node .. so I figured why not mess around and siege various simple apps.  Noticed that a simple hello world running via cluster was super fast (4200 reqs/sec) whereas the default app.js of express was really slow (300).  Going into production jumped it up to 1156.  Just trying to figure out where the overhead is coming from.  Most likely I just need to dive into what the default app is doing a
[19:38] te-brian: nd understand express a lot better.
[19:38] tjholowaychuk: 4200 ? I get that for one process
[19:38] indutny:  160 reqs/sec on rackspace 256 mb ram /cc pquerna tjholowaychuk

[19:39] te-brian: tjholowaychuk: I am on linode's smallest vps
[19:39] te-brian: tjholowaychuk: 512 ram etc.
[19:39] tjholowaychuk: te-brian in production express will cache the compiled templates
[19:39] tjholowaychuk: in dev they will "reload"
[19:39] tjholowaychuk: that's the only perf change express makes by default in production
[19:39] te-brian: tjholowaychuk: Right.. whereas my hello world is literally just res.write('hello world');.... apples to oranges I expect.

[19:40] tjholowaychuk: i remember drupal with aggressive cache was still only like 600rps
[19:41] te-brian: tjholowaychuk: If you have only anonymous traffic its fine... varnish ftw... but.. we have a lot of 'social' sites now and we need to move on to new technology :)
[19:41] tjholowaychuk: yeah, we can't really cache anything in our app
[19:41] indutny: hehe :)
[19:42] te-brian: tjholowaychuk: We have a reasonably active site where we are jumping through 100s of hoops just to get page load under 2 seconds hah.... caching fully loaded objects and whanot .... getting a little rediculous... so we are going to refactor and node looks hot.

[20:09] Skola: so stop driving your goddamn hummers
[20:09] AvianFlu: there have been at least half a dozen days where it's been 55 and drizzling here, and then when I get to the lower haight it's bright, sunny, and hot
[20:09] Skola: or I'll be swimming ina couple of decades
[20:10] foober: Skola: waterproof computers?  A skuba-gear for the laptop?
[20:10] AvianFlu: Skola: it won't be my fault, I ride a skateboard to work :-P

[20:17] foober: You can if you want...I'm dreaming of something like this: http://www.privateislandsonline.com/europe.htm
[20:17] AvianFlu: I'm only half joking, some guy actually drew up a plan to do that
[20:17] foober: Avian: at least it would serve a purpose...and would keep getting bigger.
[20:18] Skola: got a link on that plastic "island" handy?
[20:18] Skola: else I'll google it
[20:18] AvianFlu: no but it should be easily googled

[20:30] fille: loosing position and downtime on google :(
[20:31] unomi: kkaefer: Thanks :) - currently I am just windowshopping tbh
[20:31] unomi: kkaefer: I was going to ask if you had any 'full' demos?

[20:32] CyberLemon: Hello, is anybody known how to handle "Socket hang up" when remove server don't respond? In some requests (like increasing page view) I really do not need response - but Node.js quit with Socket hang up error (
[20:33] kkaefer: unomi: to test, copy ./test/fixtures/tiles/control_room.mbtiles into ./tiles
[20:33] unomi: kkaefer: great - huge fan of json-schema models
[20:33] necrodearia has joined the channel
[20:33] unomi: been digging persevere2.0 but somewhat difficult to dance with in some scenarios
[20:33] CyberLemon: *remote server, not remove ))
[20:34] kkaefer: unomi: there are some other sites, but the repos aren't public
[20:34] kkaefer: unomi: e.g. http://febp.newamerica.net/
[20:34] kkaefer: due to bones' architecture, most of the code is public anyway though
[20:34] unomi: bones feels like a more 'agile' persevere2.0 contender - same niceties of json-schema + automagic REST
[20:35] kkaefer: unomi: oh wait... that site isn't bones
[20:35] kkaefer: unomi: to be fair, there are still a lot of issues, e.g. it currently loads all code on startup
[20:36] unomi: I noticed that for the plugins commentary
[20:36] unomi: still, these servers are all about being thin, so it is unlikely to amount to much
[20:37] unomi: kkaefer: curious about the inline comments style - Dojo Docs?
[20:38] kkaefer: unomi: we generally use docco
[20:38] kkaefer: but the comments don't follow a particular style
[20:40] unomi: mighty nice presentation you manage of your shop - too bad about the whole DC / on-location constraints
[20:40] systemfault: Seems that twitters uses less and less rails every year

[20:43] fille: when the forEach is don
[20:43] systemfault: fille: forEach is sync...
[20:43] chjj: you need to do that yourself, write your own parallel foreach function
[20:43] unomi: kkaefer: that may be, but I have a nice view of rice paddies from my shack in the middle of nowhere Thailand. 
[20:43] chjj: or do it by hand
[20:43] kkaefer: heh
[20:43] kkaefer: that's pretty hard to beat I guess
[20:43] pquerna: indutny: the slides.io is neat.
[20:43] fille: okej, reed that on stackowerflow
[20:44] fille: i hoped that i could ignore it
[20:44] indutny: pquerna: hehe
[20:44] indutny: thanks
[20:44] pquerna: indutny: not sure about the only interface being to double click on things to edit/turn off the editor
[20:44] pquerna: i'd be okay wth a little chrome while in 'edit' mode
[20:44] chjj: fille: var a = [1,2,3], i = a.length; a.forEach(function() { process.nextTick(function() { --i || done(); }); });
[20:44] chjj: where done is the callback
[20:44] pquerna: but its a neat minimlistic experience :)
[20:44] indutny: heh, let discuss that tomorrow

[22:09] greenWhite: e.g. I am getting { '{"firstName":"tomory","lastName":"","email":"","reEmail":"","password":""}': '' }  when I log which is in wrong json format. All I am doing is calling JSON.stringify(obj) using jquery ajax to post and trying to JSON.parse(req.body)

[22:11] greenWhite: when I log in chrome the JSON is being converted correctly I think {"firstName":"tomory","lastName":"","email":"","reEmail":"","password":""} (passes validation) . just on node side it comes back in the former weird format

[22:36] chapel: yeah
[22:36] chapel: we talked the other day about it a bit
[22:36] chapel: and what we would do
