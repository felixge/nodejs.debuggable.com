[00:31] zachsmith: Persistent handles have a makeWeak function
[00:32] sh1mmer: drunknbass: although you could just make an http server and then kill it at will too

[00:34] beejeebus: socket.io question: how to determine if a websocket connection is 'ws' or 'wss' in the websocket.js transport code?

[00:43] isaacs: like: npm start foo some params?

[00:43] isaacs: kkaefer: i'm not sure.  why do you need that?
[00:44] kkaefer: npm start --config settings.json
[00:44] kkaefer: or npm start --verbose
[00:44] kkaefer: etc.
[00:44] isaacs: kkaefer: what about: npm config set my-package:settings settings.json ; and then readSettings(process.env.npm_package_config_settings)
[00:45] timcosgrove has left the channel
[00:45] isaacs: npm config set my-package:port 8080, {"scripts":{"start":"node server.js"}} and in server.js: server.listen(process.env.npm_config_port)
[00:45] kkaefer: not sure about that
[00:46] kkaefer: is there anything wrong with passing through the arguments?
[00:46] techwraith: is there an event I can listen to on an http server response that will fire off right before the response is sent?
[00:46] isaacs: kkaefer: well, it gets a bit hairy
[00:46] isaacs: since npm start is a one-line module, and it's actualy just calling run-script, which is also used in other places.
[00:46] kkaefer: hm, you basically can't accept any more parameters?
[00:46] kkaefer: yes
[00:46] kkaefer: like, any parameters that should remain in npm
[00:46] isaacs: right
[00:47] isaacs: which you can already do because npm's option parser stops parsing at --
[00:47] isaacs: but, still, it'd have to know in run-script.js that anything trailing gets passed on
[00:47] isaacs: also, it's actually calling sh, not your program directly
[00:47] isaacs: so it'd have to sanitize the args and append them to the -c string
[00:47] kkaefer: yeah
[00:48] kkaefer: "start": "PATH=\"node_modules/.bin:$PATH\" node index"

[00:49] kkaefer: but when I remove it, it starts my system-wide node interpreter
[00:49] kkaefer: not the alias in node_modules/.bin
[00:50] thrashaholic: what im doing is essentially parsing the cookie and loading the session from the store manually, but unfortunately with xhr-polling the request and response objects are destroyed before i can read the cookies...

[01:08] kkaefer: you can do both, but if you're building a web site, you must be willing to experiment
[01:08] kkaefer: it's not a turnkey solution like rails, or some php cms
[01:09] hvgotcodes: kkaefer: what do you mean by experiment?
[01:09] hvgotcodes: is there a module for authorization/authentication?

[01:10] hvgotcodes: techwraith: yeah i saw that
[01:10] broofa: Anyone here implemented an http proxy that uses the CONNECT method to tunnel https?
[01:11] hvgotcodes: but not an authentication/authorization module managing users
[01:11] broofa: 'Wondering if that's possible/feasible with the http/https modules.
[01:12] kkaefer: hvgotcodes: that's where it begins; there are lots of ways to do that
[01:12] hvgotcodes: kkaefer: so how
[01:13] kkaefer: well, it depends on how you want to do it
[01:13] kkaefer: that's what I mean with "experiment"
[01:13] hvgotcodes: im talking standard roles for users, with different services locked down in different ways
[01:13] hvgotcodes: so there is no standard
[01:13] hvgotcodes: ?

[01:25] thrashaholic: techwraith: you can pass file descriptors for std's iirc
[01:26] techwraith: so just use the same fd for each writeableStream and it will work?
[01:26] spuddleziz: if i can get linux-tick-processor.py to work i think im sorted
[01:26] isaacs: techwraith: yeah, but you don't want to use fs file descriptors as stdouts
[01:26] isaacs: thrashaholic: ^
[01:27] isaacs: techwraith: log = fs.createWriteStream("file.log"); cp1.on("data", log.write.bind(log)); cp2.stdout.on("data", log.write.bind(log)) ...
[01:27] isaacs: techwraith: then when all three are closed, you can close the write stream
[01:28] isaacs: techwraith: and your child procs should just spew to stdout

[01:29] davidascher has joined the channel

[01:42] broofa: mscdex actually, I think you can do parseInt(s, 36) to parse as base 36 with a-z... not that anyone would want to do that.
[01:42] draginx1: O_o not sure

[03:13] abraxas: Okay
[03:13] abraxas: mscdex: Ever had any trouble at all with node-mysql?
[03:14] mscdex: abraxas: the only problem i've have is the lack of proper blob field support, although i have a patch that adds that

[03:16] bingomanatee: Honestly do not look forward to getting back to mysql but thats how the world rolls nowadays.
[03:16] mscdex: abraxas: well, blob fields are really the only binary fields, the rest are string (or auto converted to the proper js datatype if you specify so in the config)
[03:16] deepthawt has joined the channel
[03:16] galaxywatcher has joined the channel
[03:17] abraxas: mscdex: well, in mysql you can make any string type binary. the problem you mention is that not ending up in binary buffers?
[03:17] abraxas: mscdex: or is there a problem when it comes to storing large chunks of data?
[03:18] mscdex: abraxas: iirc any non-blob field is at least converted to string in node-mysql currently
[03:19] abraxas: mscdex: alright
[03:19] mscdex: well, blobs are converted to string too
[03:19] mscdex: unless you apply my patch
[03:19] mscdex: :\
[03:19] abraxas: :) ok
[03:19] abraxas: I don't think I'll be dealing with binary data in this project, so it's not really a concern at the moment.
[03:19] mscdex: abraxas: but apprently node-mysql doesn't play nice with stored procedures either
[03:20] abraxas: Not using those either luckily.
[03:20] mscdex: me either, but thought it's worth mentioning
[03:20] abraxas: mscdex: but it makes one wonder if it doesn't then makes more sense to use libmysqlclient instead?

[04:20] draginx: DTrejo: parseInt(str, 16) just makes them into integers O_o
[04:21] DTrejo: right, that's the goal right?
[04:21] draginx: no
[04:21] draginx: i want hex into ascii
[04:21] DTrejo: oh, then do num + ''
[04:21] DTrejo: or num.toString()
[04:21] DTrejo: I think
[04:21] tbranyen: 0xff .toString(10)
[04:21] tbranyen: heh
[04:21] isaacs: draginx: you're not on node master, right?
[04:21] DTrejo: oh
[04:21] draginx: O_o im on 04.4.
[04:21] isaacs: draginx: if so, you can do new Buffer(hexStr, "hex").toString("utf8")
[04:22] draginx: DTrejo: still confused let me try th .toString?
[04:22] DTrejo: draginx: yeah, I didn't understand well what you wanted
[04:22] draginx: isaacs: ive been picking @ master though :P getting osme hex functions =x
[04:22] DTrejo: apologies for any confusion I might have caused
[04:22] draginx: toString() did not work :(
[04:22] draginx: uhhhh isaacs I knooooow but im not on it
[04:22] draginx: and i dont think 0.5 is coming out anytime soon
[04:23] tbranyen: draginx: heh toString(10) would just convert from hex to base 10
[04:23] isaacs: draginx: you can also read through your string 2 chars at a time, joining each together, and then doing parseInt(twoChars, 16), create an array of those, and then do new Buffer(theArray).toString("utf8")
[04:23] DTrejo: to toString(16) ?
[04:23] Draggor: I'm half tempted to comment on that post with something like "You must be an (emacs|vim) user"
[04:24] tbranyen: DTrejo: toString(16) would do nothing to a hex value
[04:24] draginx: toString(16) doesnt change anything nor (10)
[04:24] draginx: i think i have to go with isaac's solution
[04:24] DTrejo: yeah, ignore me hehe :)
[04:24] tbranyen: draginx: yeah toString( 10 ) wouldn't give you an ascii conversion i assumed you meant base 10
[04:24] DTrejo: how many noders does it take to answer a hex--> string question?
[04:25] isaacs: draginx: new Buffer('68656c6c6f'.match(/../g).map(function (n) { return parseInt(n, 16) })).toString("utf8")
[04:25] draginx: lmao a gazllion :P

[05:44] mscdex: if i'm using it globally, i stick it in ~/.node_modules

[05:44] ajsie: what are the advantages of this instead of using npm?
[05:45] mscdex: less bugs and less hassle? :p
[05:45] mscdex: npm stores dependencies though
[05:46] mscdex: so i guess you'd have to track those down manually too if you don't have those already
[05:46] ajsie: eg. expressjs is dependent on connect
[05:46] ajsie: how do i fix this with git repos?
[05:46] mscdex: ajsie: you can probably just extract the tarball from the repo into the directory where npm is currently storing express

[06:08] Aria: Assuming you trust that github will always be there ;-)
[06:12] ajsie: isaacs: feature request: i do "npm dev-install express" and npm should fork the repo from the github to my own one (i enter my credentials) and then it clones it and use that one in ~/npm/repos (or whatever known folder) .. then do "git remote add source <source repo>" so i can fetch latest changes ... now i could change the code easily to learn, fix bugs, code new features and do pull requests

[06:12] isaacs: that sounds like a job for git..
[06:13] ajsie: isaacs: but i cant mess with it if it has a lot of dependencies
[06:13] ajsie: cause its using npm
[06:13] isaacs: ajsie: ok, so cd into it, and bundle/install the deps
[06:13] isaacs: or just cd into it, and do `npm link`
[06:14] isaacs: npm will (hopefully!) never be a github client
[06:14] ajsie: why is that
[06:14] ajsie: github not good enough for hosting packages?

[06:19] isaacs: r
[06:19] ajsie: since source codes === our apps .. and most of them lie on github .. why not use github as _the_ repo (aka package) central .. if your repo is dependent on another repo you just have that repo location and tag in the package.json

[06:20] jy0ung has joined the channel
[06:20] ajsie: isaacs: why?
[06:21] ajsie: maybe im wrong then .. it sounded like a good solution
[06:21] isaacs: 1. the package metadata is much harder to manage and juggle.  for things like searching and listing packages, this is a Big Deal.
[06:21] tbranyen: jquery is in the process of hosting all its plugins in git
[06:21] tbranyen: will be interesting to see how that works out
[06:22] skm has joined the channel
[06:22] isaacs: 2. you run into issues where there's a bunch of forks of stuff, and now you have to be concerned with whose copy of foo you'e installed, instead of just which version
[06:22] isaacs: 3. now you have to go through git to view the data, or github's json api, instead of couch's native awesomeness
[06:22] isaacs: 4. forking the *entire registry* is a lot harder, whereas with couch you can replicate it anywhere.
[06:23] isaacs: 5. ownership of a given name is not as clear.
[06:23] isaacs: 6. instead of just validating a tarball, shasums become THE way to address things.  That is a fail.
[06:25] isaacs: don't get me wrong, git is a *damn near perfect* tool for source control tracking.
[06:25] AAA_awright: isaacs: That's a feature not a fail
[06:25] mike_miller has joined the channel
[06:25] isaacs: where you want very low level granularity of tracking every byte of content.
[06:25] AAA_awright: And who cares about "ownership" what you are looking for is specific functionality
[06:26] AAA_awright: I don't install a package because xyz made it, I might select a package for that reason, but I use it because it offers some functionality that my program depends on
[06:26] ph^ has joined the channel
[06:26] isaacs: AAA_awright: `npm install express`.  which version?  becomes whose?  what branch? what commit?
[06:26] AAA_awright: isaacs: You just listed off everything wrong with `npm install`
[06:27] isaacs: AAA_awright: I KNOW!!! and using git for thatwould make it worse, not better.
[06:27] isaacs: that's why git-based package managers generally suck.
[06:27] tbranyen: does brew count?
[06:27] tbranyen: i think just the recipes are stored in git
[06:27] AAA_awright: You can't just use git, that's about equally as useless
[06:28] isaacs: tbranyen: this is most of my frustration with brew, yes
[06:28] AAA_awright: Why would you need a "git-based" package manager when you have submodules
[06:28] isaacs: `brew install node` <-- what version does that install?
[06:28] ajsie: main reason why im thinking in these circles is that now its divided between git repos and npm packages .. often there is no API doc (or one that sucks) and some bug fixes a developer almost want to look at the source code and bug fix, debug, code new features etc. "install" things are for users only .. developers _need_ to look at the source code.. make changes .. that is part of the everyday life ..  so im really pleased with npm li
[06:28] ajsie: just clone and do npm link to "install" it locally and use it
[06:28] isaacs: AAA_awright: right, and you can do that, easily, just using git, if you want that level of granularity.  I do.
[06:28] isaacs: AAA_awright: i don't use npm to install npm's dependencies.
[06:28] AAA_awright: What does version matter? I'm looking for functionality
[06:28] tbranyen: AAA_awright: heh in the case of node
[06:28] tbranyen: version matters a hella lot
[06:28] isaacs: AAA_awright: because funcrtionality changes between versions.
[06:29] tbranyen: big diff between .2, .3, .4, .4.*
[06:29] AAA_awright: That's different functionality, who cares about that
[06:29] isaacs: AAA_awright: a version is a promise on the part of the developer that a certain set of functionality is present, and that the version will change when the functionality does.
[06:29] isaacs: AAA_awright: why not just copy and paste their code then?
[06:29] isaacs: you don't care about files, just functionality.
[06:29] AAA_awright: Specifically, versioning is semantic in some sense
[06:29] AAA_awright: isaacs: Also, NIH syndrome that's why
[06:30] isaacs: AAA_awright: yes.  commit shas are not semantic in the same way.
[06:30] muhqu has joined the channel
[06:30] AAA_awright: They identify a perticular library
[06:30] AAA_awright: A particular revision of a particular library
[06:30] isaacs: AAA_awright: no, they identify a specific set of blo bs.
[06:31] isaacs: or a sepcific blob. or a specific commit, or a tree, or any other object that git cares about.
[06:31] isaacs: they're as "semantic" as your DNA
[06:31] AAA_awright: In general yes, but as it relates to installing libraries
[06:31] isaacs: i'd prefer to refer to you as "AAA_awright" rather than GCTCATCAGATCGATAGCATTGATCGACTAGCTGCAGATACG...
[06:32] AAA_awright: That's for convienence, not because it's useful in some way/shape/form
[06:32] AAA_awright: *otherwise useful
[06:32] AAA_awright: That's why tags exist
[06:33] isaacs: AAA_awright: you're right.  convenience is somehow different from "usefulness"

[06:42] AAA_awright: isaacs: I'm referring to a particular type/subset of convienence, as in conversation.
[06:42] AAA_awright: With package managers particularly ones like apt that have no concept of revisions, it's just a way to download and install things in a pre-determined way. There's no concept of functionality or features, or at least the most it does have if any is "Hey let the man package know that I'm installed"
[06:42] AAA_awright: *convenience
[06:43] raphdg has joined the channel
[06:43] isaacs: sure
[06:43] AAA_awright: One of the reasons Git is so much better than other revision control systems is because it tracks _content_ not _files_
[06:43] springify has joined the channel
[06:43] isaacs: AAA_awright: when i'm using a package manager, i don't even want to track files
[06:43] isaacs: i don't really care what teh files are.
[06:44] isaacs: i want to know that when i do "blah" on teh comand line, it'll work like it says it does
[06:44] isaacs: or when i do require("blah"), it'll return an object that looks like the docs say it does
[06:44] atiti has joined the channel
[06:45] AAA_awright: Package managers have yet to catch up on that concept, to track _functionality_ not _libraries_. Git can track a line as it moves across a file in a repository, why can't my package manager track the library with the "parse_date_string" definition or whatever as it travels across packages

[09:21] tmzt_: using local storage for sql, and having one ORM (like rails does) with the power of mongoose, backbone, sequalous, etc.

[09:56] abraxas: Is NodeJS at a point where, if a serious bug is discovered, an update will be released within days?
[09:58] JimBastard: abraxas: If it could be fixed within a few days and warranted an immediate fix, sure?

[10:39] SubStack: and there, now comprehensive integration testing with connect and express over each of the supported persistent backends
[10:39] tmzt_: abraxas: it also shares code with v8, so if the bug was in the v8 side it could be fixed there as it also probably affects chrome
[10:40] abraxas: Right
[10:40] tmzt_: SubStack: do you think a unified ORM could work, with extensions for things like mongo that need their own query syntax?
[10:40] abraxas: mape: not yet, just been pondering hosting at Joyent if they host in Japan (latency is crucial for us).
[10:41] SubStack: tmzt_: probably not without sucking an awful lot
[10:41] SubStack: databases are too fundamentally dissimilar
[10:42] SubStack: couch versus redis versus mongo versus postgres
[10:42] tmzt_: sequolous and mongoose actaully look pretty simialr
[10:42] SubStack: requires different ways of tackling the problem
[10:42] SubStack: probably you can find some common subset for specific problems like what sesame does for session management
[10:43] gmanika: I want to have node.js and python talk. Is there any RPC scheme that is preferred/"more standard" on the node.js side?
[10:43] SubStack: but I'm not so sure the databases are similar enough to have a nice ORM that abstracts over all of them in a reasonable way
[10:43] tmzt_: yes, but session management in all those cases doesn't really need an ORM
[10:43] tmzt_: there are dnode bindings for python aren't there?
[10:43] jesusabdullah: Not yet
[10:43] SubStack: they don't work yet
[10:43] jesusabdullah: I half-started them
[10:43] jesusabdullah: I'm gonna tackle them in May sometime
[10:44] jesusabdullah: probably
[10:44] gmanika: heh I was looking at jesusabdullah's github repo right now :)
[10:44] SubStack: it should be easier now that I split up the protocol logic into dnode-protocol
[10:44] jesusabdullah: In the meantime, both should be able to use json-rpc
[10:44] jesusabdullah: Yeah, that's my thinking as well
[10:45] jesusabdullah: I also want to take a look at twisted. I think it may work well for this
[10:45] tmzt_: anybody tried redis keyed on mongo's ObjectID?
[10:45] jesusabdullah: I'd talk some more, but sleep calls
[10:46] dsirijus has joined the channel
[10:46] tmzt_: gmanika: easiest would be REST really, not the best
[10:46] tmzt_: also, possibly one of the message queues? (rabbit or ampq)
[10:46] SubStack: I've built REST interfaces in python
[10:46] SubStack: harder than it should have been really
[10:46] tmzt_: not bad with cherrypy
[10:46] SubStack: I guess that is partly my disdain for databases seeping through
[10:47] tmzt_: maybe the solution isn't ORM, but to have a query syntax that supports joins and nosql stuff, as well as just primary keys
[10:48] tmzt_: then build the ORM on top of that
[10:48] romcok has joined the channel
[10:48] misterncw has joined the channel
[10:48] tmzt_: so you have both a unified query builder api, and a unified ORM api, but different implmentations for different DBs (using DB-specific features where appropriate)
[10:50] unomi has joined the channel
[10:50] SubStack: you could get really mischievous and transform the AST of cb.toString()
[10:50] SubStack: to generate queries

[10:54] romcok: ajsie: jake?
[10:54] ajsie: jake is more like rake
[10:54] ajsie: not Thor
[10:54] ajsie: for system wide operations
[10:56] tmzt_: system wide really means directory wide now doesn't it?
[10:56] tmzt_: SubStack: cb.toString()?
[10:56] ajsie: yeah
[10:57] SubStack: v8: (function (x) { return 4 < x < 10 }).toString()
[10:57] v8bot: SubStack: "function (x) { return 4 < x < 10 }"
[10:57] SubStack: parsing that AST
[10:57] SubStack: to generate queries
[10:57] ajsie: or am i forced to write my own
[10:57] SubStack: would be so awesomely hackish
[10:57] tmzt_: ah
[10:57] tmzt_: what is cb though
[10:58] SubStack: a query callback
[10:58] tmzt_: ah
[10:58] tmzt_: yeah that would be awesome
[10:58] stagas: did a really stupid module https://github.com/stagas/jsontry
[10:58] tmzt_: does reduce do something like ethat?
[10:58] tmzt_: also, for mongo/couch, push the js to the db
[10:58] tmzt_: after sanatizing it
[10:58] SubStack: yep!
[10:58] SubStack: well sanatizing and passing in parameters
[10:59] SubStack: which you could do with the AST transform and some eval() hackery
[10:59] tmzt_: I think that sequolous, mongo-native, zend use about the same json jquery syntax though
[10:59] tmzt_: it's not bad
[10:59] romcok: hey, i get this error: Error: Cannot find module 'cradle', but i have cradle package already installed :( , someone can tell me where is the problem?
[11:00] littke has joined the channel
[11:00] SubStack: but imagine how awesome it would be to just write pure javascript
[11:00] tmzt_: I guess what's really needed is a libdrizzle-native with localstorage based sqlite binding
[11:00] SubStack: without having to bend your problem around a direct query DSL
[11:00] tmzt_: {$js : (function(params..){})}
[11:01] tmzt_: of just typeof to function, but I don't know if that collides
[11:01] chapel: stagas: whats the point of that?
[11:02] benmonty has joined the channel
[11:02] tmzt_: what I really want is to be able to write some ORM-dependent code and deply on fcgi/mysql, browserify/localstorage (or remoted ORM) and mongo
[11:02] tmzt_: with redis-based cache
[11:03] stagas: chapel: JSON.parse will throw if it's not proper json, and I was tired of rewriting that function in almost every project :P
[11:04] chapel: uhh, well send it proper json
[11:04] chapel: :P
[11:04] stagas: why not try catch it
[11:04] tmzt_: and return null?
[11:05] chapel: idk, I just dont see the reason, the whole point of parsing json, is to parse json
[11:05] tmzt_: sounds like the c# I was writting last year
[11:05] tmzt_: everything was try{parseSomething}catch{return null}
[11:05] stagas: of course, but why not get the original value back instead of throwing and do something with that?
[11:05] tmzt_: (no LINQ-to-sql on that version of vs)
[11:06] tmzt_: how hard would a regex to clean up js-valid syntax to json be?
[11:06] chapel: eh, or why not write it to work with a callback and send an error up the stack
[11:06] chapel: or stagas why not run it through JSON.stringify if it fails :P
[11:06] chapel: then parse it
[11:07] tmzt_: how do you run a string through stringify?
[11:07] tmzt_: if you can parse it why do you need stringify?
[11:07] stagas: it will return the same object
[11:07] chapel: v8: JSON.stringify({test: 'test'});
[11:07] v8bot: chapel: "{\"test\":\"test\"}"
[11:07] tmzt_: you might also want to put your code in lib :)

[11:09] chapel: odd
[11:10] stagas: a string is a valid json object

[11:10] tmzt_: yeah function(o, cb) { try ( var o = JSON.parse(o); cb(null, o); } catch{ cb('error', o); }};
[11:10] Nexxy: I needs opinion: best mongdb ORM for node?
[11:10] tmzt_: yes it is, but it's still a string when it comes out
[11:11] chapel: tmzt_: I think that would be more valuable
[11:11] chapel: then you could throw it up the stack and not get a hard throw
[11:11] Nexxy: I liek mongoose. Is good?
[11:12] tmzt_: but if you want a sync version, just return null and test for null
[11:12] tmzt_: but, null is valid json as well
[11:12] tmzt_: v8: JSON.stringify(null)
[11:12] v8bot: tmzt_: "null"

[11:49] eirikurn: yes, it's a lot of fun
[11:49] tmzt_: benmonty: there's also a way to trap the :id earlier than the individual route
[11:49] tmzt_: you could just validate it there
[11:50] benmonty: tmzt_: it's cool. i'm just playing around and don't really need to do validation on anything. 
[11:51] benmonty: tmzt_: i'll just go submit a but report or request that the guide stays in sync with the project :P
[11:51] nivoc has joined the channel
[11:51] benmonty: btw, did you guys try to reproduce the issue?
[11:52] tmzt_: do params callbacks work in experss?
[11:53] benmonty: mm, not exactly sure what that means
[11:53] benmonty: you can do app.param('my_custom_param', function () ... );
[11:53] nonnikcam has joined the channel
[11:54] benmonty: and then use '/my/route/:my_custom_param'
[11:54] tmzt_: oh, you can just use params[]
[11:54] tmzt_: like params[0]
[11:54] benmonty: yeah, that too

[12:13] ajsie: why does node have readFileSync
[12:13] ajsie: who not readFile(..., false) to specify sync
[12:13] ajsie: looks so stupid with Sync after the method names
[12:14] ajsie: ryah: reconsider!
[12:14] mscdex: ajsie: because async functions always use callback as the last parameter
[12:14] mscdex: and the Sync prefixes makes it clear that it's the sync version
[12:14] mscdex: er postfix
[12:14] SubStack: because if you really shouldn't be using it very often then it should look a little bit stupid
[12:14] ajsie: SubStack: =)
[12:15] ajsie: maybe .. if i dont pass a callback then its synced
[12:16] ajsie: or if i pass false then its synced
[12:16] ajsie: will look neater
[12:16] ajsie: reconsider!
[12:17] eirikurn: a single sync call will stall the event loop. 
[12:17] eirikurn: which is BAD, for scaling
[12:17] eirikurn:  so it should be very obvious for the only few ways that allow that to happen
[12:17] eb4890 has joined the channel
[12:17] ElDios has joined the channel
[12:18] ajsie: eirikurn: still not a good excuse imo to have an ugly API =)
[12:19] ajsie: false is false .. if you set false you know its synced .. if you don't understand you dont get node.js and shouldn't use it in the first place or learn it right?
[12:20] matyr has joined the channel
[12:21] eirikurn: funny, cuz in .Net Framework, all api's are by default sync, and include an alias with a Async postfix :)
[12:23] eirikurn: but I see what you mean. I just doubt it will change since node's fundamental mantra is to frown upon all things sync
[12:24] mscdex: ajsie: the thing is you can leave off callbacks for async functions and have it work just fine
[12:25] mscdex: for things that you don't care when they finish
[12:25] mscdex: it's probably not a good idea, since errors can happen, but still
[12:25] tyler_boyd has joined the channel
[12:25] ajsie: mscdex: yeah but a false could set that to sync 
[12:25] mscdex: meh
[12:25] ajsie: anyway =)
[12:26] shaunau: ajsie: i'd prefer it the way it is because it's clear explicit
[12:26] mscdex: i personally like the *Sync, it's more clearer
[12:26] mscdex: as to what you're doing
[12:26] shaunau: yap
[12:26] eyesUnclouded has joined the channel
[12:26] shaunau: s/a/e

[12:27] DoNaLd`: i'm here ! :)
[12:27] framlin: ajsie: its much mor ugly to pass two diffrent types of param at the same param and that the two types change semantics, than to have two functions for that
[12:27] shaunau: ajsie: you can always wrap it in your own modeule

[12:29] shaunau: ajsie: just because you can, doesnt mean you should..

[12:29] ajsie: then its a flaw on all dynamically typed langs
[12:30] shaunau: no its not
[12:30] ajsie: its should be static
[12:30] mikegerwitz: I happen to think dynamic typing is a design flaw.
[12:30] framlin: I know that its possible, but one should avoid such signatures, because its heavy to debug
[12:30] ajsie: yeah i know
[12:30] ajsie: just want to know what it the point of having dynamically typed langs then
[12:31] framlin: ajsie: you do not have such crsy things like c++-templates or (I do not know, whats the name for Java)

[14:13] lukegalea: janos: If you just try and open 1000 requests, it'll max out at the max agents..
[14:13] lukegalea: which by default is 5
[14:13] lukegalea: I think..
[14:13] lukegalea: but you can increase to 10.

[14:16] BigWookie: baudehlo: nope without a database in the backend
[14:16] ajsie: http://pastie.org/1739539
[14:16] baudehlo: BigWookie: so you want a database without a database?
[14:17] ocrampal has joined the channel
[14:17] BigWookie: I want something like a database (sorry msisphrased that)
[14:17] baudehlo: yes but you want it persistent to disk?
[14:17] BigWookie: from the usage just a js object that is automatically synced to a file on the harddrive
[14:17] baudehlo: right.
[14:17] baudehlo: which seems to be what ormnomnom does
[14:17] baudehlo: if you use sqlite as the backend, that's just a file on the harddrive.
[14:18] lukegalea: lukegalea: one sec
[14:18] lukegalea: taking a look
[14:18] lukegalea: I meant: jano ;)
[14:18] eyesUnclouded has joined the channel
[14:18] BigWookie: baudehlo: you have to define a database connection and models in order to use it, it dosn't seam like the right thing
[14:19] lukegalea: jano: there's an agent.maxSockets which says how many sockets each agent can open.. (default 5). and I believe there is one agent per host & port. 
[14:19] baudehlo: ok to be fair it might not be... But what you want is an ORM of some sort.
[14:19] lukegalea: So you if just make a whole bunch of requests it should run 5 in parallel.
[14:19] baudehlo: and use SQLite as the backend.
[14:20] ajsie: i feel that this way im doing it is more clean and leveraging the basic operations of event on node.js and sproutcore
[14:20] lukegalea: jano: I've played around with it for stress testing and never had problems.
[14:20] eyesUnclouded_ has joined the channel
[14:20] lukegalea: Want to post a gist?
[14:20] baudehlo: otherwise you're hoping that someone else can code as well as the SQLite guys can in terms of data safety, which is VERY unlikely.
[14:21] jano: lukegalea: i will, one sec
[14:21] ajsie: framlin: i do name my functions and pass them as callbacks .. but the async lib is forcing me to code in a certain way: https://github.com/caolan/async
[14:23] BigWookie: baudehlo: what I was searching for was permafrost

[14:24] ddollar has joined the channel
[14:24] baudehlo: BigWookie: sure, if you want: "This thing is still quite buggy. I wouldn't use it for anything important yet."
[14:24] framlin: ajsie: but IMHO you does not have to pass anonymous ("inline") functions. I think, that is only an example, only one code style
[14:25] jimt has joined the channel
[14:25] no-gooder has joined the channel
[14:25] BigWookie: baudehlo: I don't need it for important work
[14:26] baudehlo: FWIW permafrost uses supermarket which uses sqlite.
[14:26] no-gooder has left the channel
[14:26] framlin: there is no reason,not to define any function named function and pass it. And if you need clousures, you can develop a function that returns the callback and takes the clousure-variables as parameters

[14:27] lukegalea: jano:  I need to step away from my machine for a sec, but just paste it in or email me at luke@almlabs.com and I'll take a look. I wrote something very very similar so I'm sure I can help.
[14:27] BigWookie: baudehlo: i never said i don't want to use sqlite, i don't want to use a an extra service , but a one file db 
[14:27] framlin: ajsie: but I do not know this async.js lib
[14:27] jano: lukegalea: great, i'm removing the noise from my code so as not to distract too much from the main issue. thanks a lot

[14:28] ajsie: kinda messy
[14:28] Me1000 has joined the channel
[14:28] ajsie: but that could be that im using it wrong though
[14:28] baudehlo: esp. since node.js has no file locking (grrrr!)

[14:29] ddollar has joined the channel
[14:30] k1ttty has joined the channel
[14:30] ajsie: but since node.js is event based .. i thought why not leverage that in your code .. that is what its all about
[14:30] ajsie: and sproutcore the same
[14:30] c4milo has joined the channel
[14:31] ajsie: and its pretty simple too .. after a while it becomes your new "return" style in the synced coding

[14:38] sivy has joined the channel
[14:38] hvgotcodes: how do i tell where  a module got installed to using nvm?

[14:38] ajsie: man .. then you are really lost

[14:42] heythisisdave has joined the channel
[14:42] ajsie: coming from sync coding i code 1000 lines all in order .. 1 before 2, 2 before 3 etc .. now i found myself needing to nest 1000 times .. because the later one has to be a callback to the previous one .. and if the dependecy depth is 1000 .. then you get very confused .. i stopped when the depth was around 5-10
[14:43] framlin: ajsie: maybe ;) I code async-communicating apps since 5 years at my dayly work, so I do not see the things you do any more ;)
[14:43] ajsie: better to just return a result immediately that is an eventemitter .. just like what node is already doing

[14:44] Rob_ has joined the channel
[14:44] ajsie: i mean you clearly must have a way of coding it .. what is your secret?
[14:44] framlin: mostly I use a object, that is handling this for me in the background
[14:44] ajsie: but that is using eventEmitter?
[14:44] ajsie: its either callback or eventEmitter
[14:44] javaanse_jongens has joined the channel
[14:45] vladikoff has joined the channel
[14:45] framlin: I can add finalizers and successors and "direct"-callbacks to some function calls

[14:46] arpegius_ has joined the channel
[14:46] framlin: you define functions, that are cqlled, if siomething happens
[14:46] ajsie: but you have to use an eventEmitter .. cause a callback that needs a callback that needs a callback is unmaintainable
[14:46] BigWookie: SubStack: :/ I'm sorry to bug you but is it possible that permafrost can't find nStore (both installed via npm)?
[14:46] framlin: if you pass this functions as arguments to other functions or if you asign them to object-properties is no diffrence
[14:46] pifantastic has joined the channel
[14:47] aheckmann has joined the channel
[14:47] mikegerwitz: ajsie: They have different uses. EventEmitter is not always the answer. Do not nest too deeply. Reference another function.
[14:47] SubStack: BigWookie: nstore != nStore
[14:48] ajsie: mikegerwitz: but if every function is ascyned .. then i have to use callbacks
[14:48] BigWookie: :O 
[14:48] BigWookie: SubStack: thanks, that was the probelm , i would add it to the package.js
[14:48] BigWookie: *json
[14:48] mikegerwitz: ajsie: Split the logic out into different functions/methods the same way you would other code. You don't want a 1000 line function. You'd factor that into many separate functions. Using that same logic, make those separate functions. But rather than calling them one after another, put the references as the callbacks.
[14:49] framlin: ajsie: this is only unmaintainable, if you pass all this callbacks as nested anonymous functions, but you do not have to ....
[14:50] mikegerwitz: so maybe foo.readFile( 'bar', processFile ); rather than foo.readFile( 'bar', function() { /* 100 more lines */ } );
[14:50] ajsie: mikegerwitz: but what im trying to say is that if im using 10 asynched functions in a row .. the first one returning result to the other one .. then i have to pass callbacks to callbacks and so on ..
[14:50] mikegerwitz: ajsie: Yes, you do. But they don't need to be nested functions
[14:50] akahn has left the channel
[14:50] ajsie: hmm ok
[14:51] SubStack: ajsie: there are flow control libs for that
[14:51] SubStack: if you want anonymous functions without the nesting

[14:52] SubStack: BigWookie: oh keep in mind that supermarket has some concurrency problems on account of sqlite

[15:54] isaacs: brolin: can you update that to gnu tar 1.24?
[15:54] johnnywengluu: framlin: yeah i get you
[15:54] isaacs: brolin: also, what command are you running?
[15:54] johnnywengluu: framlin: here is my current style : https://gist.github.com/896631
[15:55] arpegius has joined the channel
[15:55] brolin: i will try
[15:55] johnnywengluu: its working for me cause i get this kind of code better =)
[15:55] johnnywengluu: not that mathematical .. just simple logic
[15:55] jdalton has left the channel
[15:56] johnnywengluu: is it something bad with my kind of coding?
[15:57] johnnywengluu: https://gist.github.com/896634
[15:57] johnnywengluu: with highligting =)
[15:58] johnnywengluu: but it feels kinda powerful .. multiple functions can listen on funA .. or funB .. can hook up but i don't have to change anything in the functions
[15:58] johnnywengluu: kinda very modular
[15:58] Horofox has joined the channel
[15:58] framlin: johnnywengluu: seem to be a bit more nested-syle ;)
[15:59] johnnywengluu: yeah but not that kinda hard looking nesting style like the code i had with callbacks 
[15:59] Booths has joined the channel
[15:59] brolin: isaacs: the last package of tar is 1.23, for the 1.24 i need to build it
[15:59] isaacs: brolin: oh, ok, well 1.23 should work, too
[16:00] framlin: did you compare my code-snippet with yours and think my callback-style is more nested?
[16:00] aho has joined the channel
[16:00] johnnywengluu: i didnt mean your style
[16:00] johnnywengluu: i meant mine

[16:00] framlin: ahh, ok, I see ;)
[16:00] nate2 has joined the channel

[16:08] kmiyashiro: so
[16:08] johnnywengluu: everything is possible if the core functions return an event emitter..i love this style =)
[16:09] brolin: isaacs: with tar zxvf npm-x-x.tgz works, but with the script not
[16:09] brolin: what could be the reason
[16:09] Nomon has joined the channel
[16:10] daniellindsley has joined the channel
[16:11] johnnywengluu: and the best part is that it's jquery/sproutcore "compliant" .. you work with this some time and you really get asynched way of doing things
[16:12] kmiyashiro: if I have a server  instance and it's set to return results using an event emitter in the global scope, why is it that if two people request stuff at the same time, the response can go to either person?
[16:12] brolin: is for the gzip! node ./cli.js install -g output https://gist.github.com/896669

[16:13] johnnywengluu: but that is kinda my "glue" callback .. not a real implemented one

[16:13] blueadept has joined the channel
[16:13] jscheel: hey guys, quick express question: I have a block of content that can be passed straight into my layout, without needing it's own view. Should I just make a "blank" view, or is there a way to pass content right into the layout? 
[16:13] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[16:13] droops has joined the channel
[16:13] johnnywengluu: =)
[16:13] johnnywengluu: you have suggestions?
[16:14] johnnywengluu: still trying to figure out a good style of doing async coding
[16:14] tjholowaychuk: jscheel: a layout is just a regular view, so if needed you can do res.render('layout', { body: html });
[16:14] tjholowaychuk: johnnywengluu: callbacks
[16:14] johnnywengluu: eventEmitter was the easiest for me
[16:14] jscheel: tjholowaychuk: hah, thanks.

[16:29] orch has joined the channel

[16:30] orch has left the channel
[16:31] johnnywengluu: making me wanna choose one of these 2 ways of doing async coding

[16:31] tjholowaychuk: they have different purposes
[16:31] johnnywengluu: yeah .. i know
[16:31] johnnywengluu: eventemitter sounds more like for events

[16:34] unomi: heresy!
[16:34] tjholowaychuk: sometimes bash is far superior, sometimes c, sometimes c++ etc
[16:34] johnnywengluu: i just take time / learning / costs into account too
[16:35] johnnywengluu: cant afford to learn iphone sdk, android sdk, java, obj c, c++ etc etc
[16:35] tjholowaychuk: just saying you might want to re-think what you are trying to do :p
[16:35] Draggor: unomi: What other things were you looking for?  For this first release it'll just be nick/chan allow/deny, and only on plugin load.  Next release is modifying the listeners while the plugin is loaded, and then dealing with irc statuses, such as being identified, having voice, etc
[16:35] johnnywengluu: tjholowaychuk: what am i trying to do?
[16:35] tjholowaychuk: use event emitters everywhere
[16:35] johnnywengluu: yeah

[17:06] tbranyen: hvgotcodes: using the commonjs assertion shiz?
[17:06] Tobsn: hvgotcodes if( myfunction() ) { works }
[17:06] Tobsn: ;)
[17:06] baudehlo: mraleph: to be honest it's just an ease of debugging thing. Finding a line number is a lot easier than a string.
[17:06] johnnywengluu: hvgotcodes: why dont you want to use testing libraries?
[17:06] dans has joined the channel
[17:06] mraleph: that is true
[17:07] hvgotcodes: johnnywengluu: just trying to get simple validation for now
[17:07] tbranyen: hvgotcodes: check out the commonjs module for assertions its very easy to understand
[17:07] tbranyen: and is built into node
[17:07] hvgotcodes: the real question is how do i set up a running server that always returns the same thing, and then use that in a test
[17:07] baudehlo: mraleph: also I've used it in code which gets called from multiple places, and providing two levels of line numbers is useful there too.
[17:07] johnnywengluu: hvgotcodes: with testing frameworks=)
[17:08] johnnywengluu: that supports teardown
[17:08] SubStack: hvgotcodes: express is pretty simple to hack something up with

[17:09] SubStack: hvgotcodes: here's an example of an expresso test https://github.com/substack/node-ent/blob/master/test/codes.js 
[17:09] johnnywengluu: and assertion is assertion
[17:09] hvgotcodes: SubStack: i dont need another dependency.  i just need a server that returns some json
[17:09] SubStack: it is pretty much the same as using the vanilla assert module except it runs your exports
[17:09] baudehlo: mnbvasd: do you have an example usage?
[17:09] johnnywengluu: bdd just tries to make it all more understandable rather than just providing assertion functions

[17:30] jscheel: tjholowaychuk: finally got to test rendering the layout directly. One thing I found, is that you have to define layout: false, or it res.render() will try to render the layout inside of the layout :P
[17:31] Fullmoon has joined the channel
[17:31] jscheel: tjholowaychuk: I wonder, would it be more intuitive to have to option to just pass an object to res.render(), in which case it will use the layout automatically?

[17:32] jmhnilbog has joined the channel
[17:32] jscheel: tjholowaychuk: so, res.render('viewname', {data: 'blah'}); for regular views
[17:33] jscheel: tjholowaychuk: but, to just use the layout:
[17:33] draginx has joined the channel
[17:33] jscheel: res.render({body: 'blah'});
[17:33] jscheel: so, if the first argument is not a string, but is an object, automatically default to the layout

[17:37] tjholowaychuk: for example you are not bound to a single layout
[17:37] tjholowaychuk: so it doesn't make much sense to assume just "layout"
[17:37] meandi has joined the channel
[17:37] jscheel: tjholowaychuk: ah, true

[17:40] Tobsn: does anyone know why i cant data.trim() the addlistener "data" event in a server?
[17:42] findchris has joined the channel
[17:43] mscdex: Tobsn: it's probably a Buffer
[17:43] mscdex: convert it to string first
[17:43] Tobsn: yeah... it tells me its a object
[17:43] mscdex: (''+data).trim()
[17:43] Tobsn: oh
[17:43] Tobsn: oooooh...
[17:43] ricklon: Anyone worked with node-serial? I'm finding that it stops listening on the port after about 8 reads or the buffer empties.
[17:44] mscdex: Tobsn: otherwise you can have it automatically convert to string using setEncoding on the request or socket
[17:44] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[17:45] emattias has joined the channel
[17:45] Tobsn: mscdex, but net.createServer(function(socket){socket.addListener('data',function(data){ sys.puts(data); });}).listen(123);
[17:45] Tobsn: thats still a correct socket server waiting for data coming, right?
[17:46] Tobsn: im getting confused with .on() and onRead() and whatnot
[17:46] mscdex: on is the new way to do addListener
[17:46] Tobsn: oh
[17:46] Tobsn: thats actually the new way
[17:46] mscdex: what version of node are you using?
[17:46] Tobsn: now
[17:46] Tobsn: 0.5.0
[17:47] mscdex: ok
[17:47] mscdex: sys is now util also
[17:47] arpegius_ has joined the channel
[17:48] mscdex: but you could do something like this: net.createServer(function(socket){socket.setEncoding('utf8'); socket.on('data', function(data){console.log(data); });}).listen(123);
[17:48] ricklon: Tobsn: Good question node-serial uses on, other examples I saw used listen
[17:48] timcosgrove has joined the channel
[17:48] wirehead has joined the channel
[17:48] Tobsn: yeah i just put in the setencoding
[17:48] mscdex: Tobsn: setEncoding will make the 'data' event always emit a string instead of Buffer
[17:48] timcosgrove has left the channel
[17:48] mscdex: ok :)
[17:48] Tobsn: lets see if i can change that on the client and see if it works

[17:49] mytrile has joined the channel
[17:49] Tobsn: client side i do write('blah1'); -> blah6

[17:59] mscdex: baudehlo: libxmljs has a push parser that's quite nice
[17:59] Tobsn: is on( 'data' ) the correct event?
[17:59] eventi: isaacs: I do have a problem on one machine not being able to find something npm says is there - where should I start troubleshooting?
[17:59] mscdex: baudehlo: also, TLS would not be difficult to implement really for SMTP
[17:59] isaacs: eventi: where does npm say it is?

[18:09] isaacs: eventi: that is correct.
[18:09] unomi: what I am after would likely be more suitable as a plugin anyway. But to answer your question, I am after either a socket or port that I can pass a string in a suitable format and it would pass that along into irc-space
[18:09] Tobsn: mscdex, the debug output of titanium right now, as the code is in the gist:
[18:09] Tobsn: [INFO] reading: "blah1 - 1"
[18:09] Tobsn: [INFO] reading: "blah2blah3blah4blah5 - 1"
[18:10] eventi: ok - thanks again 
[18:10] Tobsn: (coming from the addlistener "read" event)
[18:10] isaacs: eventi: npm install npm -g;  npm rm redis; curl ... =rc sh
[18:10] isaacs: eventi: npm 1.0 is blissfully unaware of the symlink mess that is npm 0x
[18:11] Tobsn: mscdex, if you put a Ti.API.info() right where the socket.write() is it putputs each string by itself - and not jumpled up as the client receives it

[18:29] edw: Can I depend on the Node.js redis library converting a list to a string in HMSET calls where I supply a hash as an argument?
[18:29] pquerna: hmm
[18:29] edw: E.g. client.hmset('foo', {a: [1, 2, 3]}); client.hget('foo', a',
[18:29] edw: function(e,o) { console.log(typeof o); })

[19:10] s0urce: i did a realtime sync flashgame with it, is nice, but a bit unstable
[19:10] isaacs: yeah, it seemed a bit flaky
[19:11] isaacs: the thing i liked more about node is that it started with a solid IO story, and then chose js just because it happened to be a good fit.
[19:11] s0urce: after the memory leak fix, its ok, but not what i will stay at :)
[19:11] s0urce: thats why i am here ^^
[19:11] isaacs: i felt like some of the other ssjs platforms went the other direction.
[19:11] isaacs: ie, first pick js, and then try to find the platform that fits it
[19:12] s0urce: the most funny thing at node is, there a some tutorial vids out there, spoken from a german guy in english, but no german vid or tutorial anywhere -.-
[19:13] s0urce: back to fs, now i know how to watch file changes, but how can i reload my express file?
[19:13] s0urce: just re-exec app.get(...)?
[19:14] iFire has joined the channel
[19:14] tjholowaychuk: s0urce: that's the issue with reloading.. you basically have to reload everything
[19:15] s0urce: ...
[19:15] tjholowaychuk: IMO it's more or less useless not to
[19:15] s0urce: restart on command line each change is more annoying
[19:15] ChrisCi: Hi there, I have a problem with https.request that seem to cut the request data/
[19:15] tjholowaychuk: s0urce: no, but something like cluster can do it for you
[19:16] rboyd has joined the channel
[19:16] s0urce: but should i rly use cluster just for reload function?
[19:16] tjholowaychuk: im just saying in general that you should reload the entire thing
[19:16] tjholowaychuk: not just try and hack reloading of modules

[19:17] tjholowaychuk: you just have issues like you are right now

[19:18] tjholowaychuk: when it takes < 1 second to spawn the new process who cares
[19:18] arpegius_ has joined the channel
[19:18] s0urce: and what does cluster do?
[19:19] s0urce: oh
[19:19] tjholowaychuk: re-spawns the process
[19:19] s0urce: <-- silly :)
[19:19] s0urce: ejs changes also works without fs ^
[19:19] tjholowaychuk: express only caches the templates in production
[19:19] voodootikigod: ricklon: see if you have anything else installed
[19:20] ricklon: Nothing else is connected serially. I'm doing a system restart just in case.
[19:20] s0urce: looks like i have many to learn ;/

[19:21] eazyigz: I am trying to erase a file's contents by doing: fs.writeFile('/cache.manifest', '').  However, that doesn't do anything.
[19:21] eazyigz: any ideas?
[19:21] draginx1: haml/jade changes also respawn (but im not sure with cluster)
[19:21] s0urce: so i need to do the reload inside the main app.js and not inside the project one, right?
[19:21] draginx1: eazyigz: doesnt the second param need to be "w"? 
[19:21] draginx1: for write O_o
[19:21] draginx1: wait nvm
[19:21] draginx1: doesnt make sense
[19:22] s0urce: writeFile(xxx,"read") would be a bit strange ;)

[19:22] dguttman has joined the channel
[19:22] draginx1: right but there has to be a way
[19:22] draginx1: for nodejs to know whether u want to file_append
[19:22] draginx1: or not
[19:23] draginx1: eazyigz: try creating a callback and see if u get an error..
[19:23] eazyigz: When you do fs.open('/cache.manifest', 'a', 666, function(e, id) {....
[19:23] draginx1: coul dbe writing permissions
[19:23] eazyigz: that opens it for appending
[19:23] eazyigz: but I just want to overwrite all contents in the file
[19:23] eazyigz: so...

[19:33] drudge: ah yeah

[19:34] drudge: Chill Pill is very nice, but Fever isn't worth 30 bucks
[19:34] drudge: Chill Pill 2.0 is going to support GR
[19:34] tjholowaychuk: awesome
[19:35] drudge: tjholowaychuk: have you tried Reeder for Mac?
[19:35] tjholowaychuk: drudge: yeah, it's missing all the management stuff though
[19:35] tjholowaychuk: and my GR is a massive mess
[19:35] tjholowaychuk: so that is what I need the most, google's UI is to painful
[19:35] drudge: ah
[19:35] tjholowaychuk: beyond painful
[19:36] tjholowaychuk: my blind cat could design something better
[19:36] V1: You can always try socialite app tjholowaychuk

[19:53] kmiyashiro: tjholowaychuk: node sass doesn't support scss format?
[19:53] ChrisCi: There is not a lot of documentation on how to use https.request.
[19:53] tjholowaychuk: kmiyashiro: no, it's really old, and doesn't support a lot of things
[19:53] tjholowaychuk: use stylus
[19:53] kmiyashiro: haha...
[19:54] kmiyashiro: I see how it is
[19:54] ChrisCi: Everythign works when I do a call at the time but when I start having different tequest at the same time there are problems.

[19:54] icebox has joined the channel

[19:57] Spion__: oh wait, now it works perfectly here.
[19:57] mikegerwitz: Spion__: if you `chmod +x` a file, then attempt to execute it, the shell will attempt to execute it regardless of extension. So it should work, yes.

[20:08] Gigawatt: use length ?
[20:08] mikegerwitz: var len = arr.length; for ( var i = 0; i < len; i++ )   , yeah.
[20:08] beawesomeinstead has joined the channel
[20:08] Gigawatt: and that should return intergers ?
[20:09] baudehlo: you can initialise both locally: for (var i=0,len=arr.length; i < len; i++ )
[20:09] mikegerwitz: Gigawatt: i will always be an integer in that case, yes

[20:41] Tobsn: thanks ;)
[20:41] mikegerwitz: Tobsn: well not necessarily ;) any time you call a function, you invoke it
[20:41] Tobsn: btw. is there some hipster tutorial how to build a class module, the correct way
[20:42] Tobsn: well i want a class with a constructor but i want to write it like a object
[20:42] Tobsn: im wondering if thats possible

[21:07] Gigawatt: how bigwould you say i should set the chunk size ?
[21:07] mscdex: pipe them
[21:08] Gigawatt: hmm, does piping do when the data is ready ?
[21:08] AAA_awright: Yeah let the OS deal with that

[21:41] mscdex: monokrome: which issue?
[21:42] isaacs: jcody: compare: `npm root` vs `npm root -g` 
[21:42] Tobsn: or first find out if im right

[21:43] isaacs: jcody: where did you look?  (actually curious about where this info should be spelled out)
[21:43] Tobsn: its probably about where you build your node
[21:43] jcody: https://github.com/isaacs/npm#readme
[21:43] isaacs: ok
[21:44] isaacs: thanks.
[21:44] Tobsn: yeah, i had to forum search it too
[21:44] isaacs: still working out technical issues, haven't really given the docs the love they deserve yet
[21:44] Tobsn: shouldnt that be inverted btw?

[21:45] Tobsn: #lighttpd crazy people showed me why...
[21:45] isaacs: Poetro: cygwin is a ghetto

[21:46] mattrobenolt has joined the channel
[21:46] Tobsn: its a socket, so there is no termination signal... its literally a stream. the first write() always gets separated and than afterwards "concatted" cause its a stream...
[21:46] isaacs: it's just, i don't know.  it seems like the type of software that's been on life support for so long, even though we all know what the compassionate thing is.
[21:46] Tobsn: and the 50ms timeout worked only cause the kernel assumes the stream ended
[21:46] Tobsn: so i had do implement my own temrination string and split() on it
[21:46] Tobsn: *fixed

[21:48] baudehlo: the "sqlite3" driver works nicely, returns SQLITE_BUSY appropriately, but crashes node...
[21:48] baudehlo: the "sqlite" driver doesn't return SQLITE_BUSY, so you get database locks.

[22:54] RusAlex: http://pastebin.com/vRFdDaWx this is my  code. so next one is my jade template http://pastebin.com/Rcr0ZyF0
[22:54] jscheel has joined the channel
[22:54] RusAlex: temlate renders only one LI element. i didn't uderstand why
[22:54] RusAlex: but in my console i see 3 docs
[22:54] jscheel: tjholowaychuk: any idea why a try catch block around res.render() would not catch when the view is missing in express 2.2.0?
[22:55] RusAlex: any idea ?
[22:55] tjholowaychuk: jscheel: it's not supposed to, it's there to unwind the stack
[22:55] tjholowaychuk: jscheel: and then next(err)
[22:56] carnivore has joined the channel
[22:56] tjholowaychuk: RusAlex: what version of express?
[22:56] jscheel: tjholowaychuk: really? I wonder if I have an older version of express on my work computer, because it would catch the error there, but the same code here doesn't catch it
[22:56] tjholowaychuk: RusAlex: and with jade, try - each offer in offers + offer.title
[22:56] tjholowaychuk: instead
[22:56] RusAlex: express 2.0.0beta3   and node 0.5.0pre
[22:56] tjholowaychuk: jscheel it ends up in the callback or next(err)
[22:57] tjholowaychuk: it's not supposed to be silent
[22:57] jscheel: tjholowaychuk: hmm, so, if sub is defined it will throw an exception though, right
[22:57] tjholowaychuk: RusAlex: also you can remove "locals: " the object passed IS the locals now
[22:57] tjholowaychuk: but that will still work
[22:57] tjholowaychuk: jscheel: yup
[22:58] tjholowaychuk: if it's a sub template, it throws, unwinding the stack to prevent several next() calls

[22:59] RusAlex: tjholowaychuk: oh, now i see elements but they blank. thanks
[22:59] jscheel: tjholowaychuk: ahh, it looks like it changed between 2.0.0 and 2.2.0
[22:59] RusAlex: will continue to develop my small app
[22:59] tjholowaychuk: jscheel: yeah there was a recent fix
[22:59] jscheel: <--- needs to run npm umpdate more
[23:00] xandrews has joined the channel
[23:00] jscheel: tjholowaychuk: cool, I'll just throw it in the callback, thanks
[23:00] tjholowaychuk: jscheel: you can check err.view specifically if you are just looking to target a missing view
[23:00] tjholowaychuk: err.view.path etc are available
[23:01] RusAlex: tjholowaychuk: also one small question, why res.render used in callback? early it used in express ofter all models finded?
[23:01] RusAlex: s/ofter/after/g
[23:01] jscheel: tjholowaychuk: ok, thanks. What I'm doing is checking for an existing view first, then, if it doesn't exist, use the url to pull the content from a different site (either new or cached) and display it
[23:01] tjholowaychuk: the callback is optional
[23:01] jscheel: basically a fallback
[23:02] galaxywatcher has joined the channel
[23:02] tjholowaychuk: jscheel: ah, then yeah you will want to if (err.view)  whatever else next(err)
[23:02] RusAlex: tjholowaychuk: let me see, is callback will be more fast and less memory usage ?
[23:02] jscheel: tjholowaychuk: next step is res.send(404)  :)

[23:03] carnivore: Is NODE_ENV a global variable or something?
[23:04] carnivore: where can I find a list of such variables?
[23:04] tjholowaychuk: it's just an env var
[23:04] jscheel: carnivore: console.dir(process.env)
[23:04] tjholowaychuk: nothing specific to node
[23:04] tjholowaychuk: it's just what I use for configuration with express

[23:26] MatthewS has joined the channel
[23:26] techwraith: It would be super useful for logging if I could listen for the 'end' event for an http response, and ideas on how to implement this?
[23:26] ryah: mjr_: I would like to reproduce that memleak
[23:27] ryah: mjr_: my primative tests are nto doing it
[23:27] tjholowaychuk: techwraith: proxy the method
[23:27] mjr_: ryah: I'm starting to think it's not actually a leak.  It looks like each connection that is active actually consumes a lot of memory, like 1MB.
[23:28] tjholowaychuk: techwraith: var end = res.end; res.end = function(){ call end() here };
[23:28] techwraith: tjholowaychuk: wut?
[23:28] tjholowaychuk: "wrap" it
[23:28] tjholowaychuk: with your functionality, that's what connect does
[23:28] tjholowaychuk: for logging
[23:28] techwraith: Interesting, that makes sense
[23:29] ryah: mjr_: i thought it was growing?
[23:29] wirehead has joined the channel
[23:29] mjr_: Yeah, I thought i twas too, but it looks like it directly relates to the number of active connections.
[23:30] mjr_: When the numbers were lower, I just didn't notice.  As we got more popular, each process started taking on over 200 connections, which seems to burn at least 200MB.
[23:30] ryah: okay...
[23:30] mjr_: I *think* that's what is happening.
[23:30] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: i don't think so
[23:30] isaacs: (re adding mroe core modules)
[23:30] pquerna: mjr_: well, there are openssl issues in general with tls contexts
[23:30] tjholowaychuk: k cool :)
[23:31] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: is crypto already gone in 0.5.x?
[23:31] mjr_: pquerna: 1MB+ per context?
[23:31] pquerna: mjr_: http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~nagendra/openssl-patches/trunk/revision/2
[23:31] xandrews has joined the channel
[23:32] mjr_: huh.  What's that do?  Make records "smaller"?
[23:33] mjr_: That patch is from 2009, surely here in the glaringly bright future world of 2011 this or something like it has been merged into openssl mainline, no?
[23:33] ryah: if that's the case i wonder why stunnel is so small
[23:33] pquerna: mjr_: mjr_ http://journal.paul.querna.org/articles/2010/07/10/overclocking-mod_ssl/
[23:33] pquerna: Adam mentions a patch reducing OpenSSL’s default buffer allocations from 50kb to 5kb, and suggests the Tor project has a similar patch. I have been unable to find it.
[23:33] pquerna: thats the patch I was linked to in the comments
[23:34] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: the word from the room seems to be "Let's not remove it, just remove the sucky bits, and make the api consistent"
[23:34] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: ah good to hear
[23:34] rolando__ has joined the channel
[23:34] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: are you using ciphers?
[23:34] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: because that's the sucky bits.
[23:34] k1ttty has joined the channel
[23:34] isaacs: hashing is pretty important, though.  checksums are important.
[23:34] isaacs: but they should be a stream interface.
[23:35] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: I mostly just use the hashing
[23:35] tjholowaychuk: it might be nice to have js equivalents for people who dont have openssl
[23:35] mjr_: pquerna: 50KB vs. 9KB is totally ignorable for the issue I'm seeing.  My node processes are at 500MB RSS when holding open about 250 https connections.  V8 says that heap is about 200MB.
[23:35] tjholowaychuk: but maybe not
[23:35] ryah: mjr_: we're discussing verbally
[23:35] ryah: you should call in
[23:35] tjholowaychuk: since that's slow haha
[23:35] mjr_: somebody there surely has Voxer.  :)
[23:36] isaacs: var file = fs.createReadStream("foo"); var hasher = crypto.createHashStream("sha1"); file.pipe(hasher);  hash.on("data", function (hash) { ... })
[23:36] ryah: mjr_: hold a sec - we're going to get a conf line 
[23:36] isaacs: ACTION would love that^
[23:36] isaacs: (the crypto thing, not the conf line)
[23:36] mjr_: But seriously, I can call a PSTN number.

[23:38] mjr_: I know, seriously.
[23:38] mjr_: Lemme go find my land line thing.

[23:41] tim_smart: ecamscript engine in C - heh
[23:41] jonaslund: is there a V8 C dump backend? :)
[23:41] ryah: carnivore: you can disassmeble it 
[23:41] vckt has joined the channel
[23:42] jonaslund: tim_smart: I actually made a Ecmascript-C translator prototype
[23:42] jonaslund: very small subset
[23:42] Remoun has joined the channel
[23:42] carnivore: i thought nodejs is written in c
[23:42] ckknight: jonaslund: fun
[23:43] carnivore: (I have very little knowledge of this, so my comments/questions are pretty stupid)
[23:43] carnivore: so how does V8 work? does it take ecmascript and compile it right to bytecode?
[23:43] ryah: carnivore: node is written in c++
[23:44] ryah: carnivore: it generates machine code directly
[23:44] jonaslund: ckknight: it was interesting.. got performance within a factor of V8 (before the crankshaft update)
[23:44] carnivore: ryah: ohhh
[23:44] carnivore: ryah: gotcha
[23:44] carnivore: ryah: thanks
[23:44] Andi5: jonaslund: How fast is this?
[23:45] jonaslund: Andi5: maybe half the speed for the small prototype

[23:45] mjr_: jonaslund: 250 median number of connections, 500MB RSS is after a while.
[23:45] jonaslund: Andi5: very very small subset just to see what kind of performance i would get
[23:46] dgathright has joined the channel
[23:46] piscisaureus: @ryah: what do you mean when you say you hate writing main functions?
[23:47] jonaslund: mjr_: the V8 GC gets info from the bindings (see buffer) about their memory usage, if the SSL bindings don't report every piece of memory it uses then it's obvious that the V8 heap is 200 mb and don't trigger GC's
[23:47] Andi5: jonaslund: Would be cool (but surely impossible) to transform your blueprint server JS jobs into C(++)
[23:47] Andi5: I think of MongoDB
[23:47] jonaslund: Andi5: My main interest was/is to transform the code to use with iPhone,etc
[23:48] jonaslund: on the server side V8 will with a pretty big certainty always be faster
[23:48] pquerna: isaacs: hey, so.. do you know much about couchdb replication?
[23:48] jonaslund: lots of optimizations you really can't do with pre-compilation compared to a jit

[23:51] jonaslund: oscarkilhed: I doubt anyone really feels that it's a good idea to maintain a separate fork
[23:52] ryah: tmzt_: c++ bindings are possible
[23:53] ryah: piscisaureus: i just feel writing a whole program for a simple test is too much
[23:53] tmzt_: ryah: so you have to have a c++ layer to call a c library?

[23:55] ryah: tmzt_: it's all c++
