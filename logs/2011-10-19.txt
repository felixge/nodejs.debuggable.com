[00:01] SubStack: meh
[00:02] SubStack: I have no desire to be like those

[00:13] isaacs: oh, shoot.  it's behind a config flag now.
[00:13] jhurliman: you can go to that page and see it's a simple nodejs app that logs a string into redis when you make a request and prints out the 20 most recent requests
[00:13] isaacs: just a sec.

[00:21] isaacs: no, wait, it should be true by default....

[00:23] thalll has joined the channel
[00:27] isaacs: jhurliman: figured it out
[00:27] isaacs: req.connection is set, but req.connection.socket isn't
[00:27] isaacs: and it's testing for both.
[00:27] jhurliman: aha
[00:28] jhurliman: req.socket is the same as req.connection.socket, or no?
[00:28] isaacs: no
[00:28] isaacs: er, yes, but req.socket isn't set on the version of node that we're using, and nether is req.connection.socket
[00:29] jhurliman: ahh
[00:29] jhurliman: this seems kind of tricky to write secure code for. right now i'm using the line:
[00:29] jhurliman: var remoteAddress = req.headers['x-real-ip'] || req.headers['x-forwarded-for'] || req.socket.remoteAddress;
[00:29] eignerchris has joined the channel
[00:29] isaacs: jhurliman: you should have it now
[00:29] jhurliman: which is fine if you know for sure that there is a proxy sitting in front of you that is setting one of those two headers. but if that's not the case, an attacker could send one of those headers to spoof their identity
[00:29] jhurliman: checking
[00:30] jhurliman: success! ty isaacs
[00:30] isaacs: jhurliman: yes, that is correct.
[00:30] jhurliman: going to ignore the potential hole for now and assume there is going to be a proxy sitting in front of me on ur.no.de
[00:30] isaacs: there will be.
[00:30] jhurliman: cool
[00:31] isaacs: jhurliman: but, in general, you should never rely on any particular header any more than you should rely on query string or anything else the user sends you
[00:31] elliottcable: isaacs:  All set! Tests running now.
[00:31] elliottcable: isaacs:  do you think a “contributing to Node” guide would be well-received? I’d love to save others the quantity of time I spent figuring a lot of this out.
[00:31] isaacs: elliottcable: we have one, if you wanna add to it, that'd be good

[00:34] astropirate has joined the channel
[00:34] jhurliman: isaacs, understood, but the ip address of the requesting client is one of those things that *should* be 99.9% verifiable (ignoring more complex tcp attacks). but if you're in a scenario where you aren't sure about your server setup (there may or may not be machines in between you and the client) that's no longer the case. either way this is just a silly sandbox for me, not a big deal
[00:35] kickingvegas has left the channel
[00:35] isaacs: jhurliman: the req.connection.remoteAddress is reliable.  the x-forwarded-for header is not, necessarily
[00:35] jocafa has joined the channel
[00:36] isaacs: jhurliman: a more comprehensive test would be to make sure that req.connection.remoteAddress is the address of the proxy (or just some non-public 10.*.*.* address) and then trust the x-forwarded if so
[00:36] jhurliman: that's a good idea
[00:37] jhurliman: if (isPrivateIP(req.connection.remoteAddress)) { req.connection.remoteAddress = req.headers['x-forwarded-for']; } or something like that
[00:37] isaacs: when i was at yahoo, our hacked apache build had a list of all the ip patterns that were "internal" and if the x-real-ip wasn't set, and the remote address was something external, it'd set x-real-ip to that, and then internally you'd just *always* look at that header.
[00:38] isaacs: jhurliman: you might break something setting that field, though ;)
[00:38] jhurliman: ah yeah

[00:40] isaacs: elliottcable: this on a branch or something?
[00:41] elliottcable: isaacs:  nope, the new ready-for-Node-master commits are in my master
[00:41] isaacs: oh, right with the ` things
[00:41] elliottcable: I just put the correct commit IDs right in that command
[00:41] elliottcable: should be all golden for copy-paste as long as you have a clean working tree / nothing to lose by jumping around branches
[00:41] elliottcable: also, you need a fairly recent `git` for `git cherry-pick a..b` to work correctly; it would silently fail in older `git`s.
[00:42] isaacs: i've got my own shorthands and stuff.  thanks, though :)
[00:42] elliottcable: hahaha okay
[00:42] elliottcable: I wasn’t sure how git-savvy you were. No offense intended if you know your shit ^‿^

[00:43] Squeese has joined the channel
[00:43] elliottcable: @herby (I think?) brought up an interesting possibility; of actually patching `v8` to understand “SetGlobal” or similar
[00:43] elliottcable: then we wouldn’t need any prototype hackery *and* we would receive all changes dynamically.
[00:44] elliottcable: I’m not familiar enough with the internals of `v8` yet to be sure that’s possible; they could be doing some optimizations to the relationship between their odd global_proxy and the global-object they create

[00:50] DTrejo: question about memory usage in node: if I make an event emitter, and then it emits the complete event, and never will emit another event, does it get gc'd and all that? or does it stick around. I'd think it would get gc'd?
[00:50] isaacs: DTrejo: do youhave any references to it?
[00:50] DTrejo: I don't think so

[01:09] elliottcable: isaacs:  it doesn’t *directly* check if it’s set as the prototype, though. It should continue passing if you decided to switch things over to using a proxy or similar.
[01:09] isaacs: but you didn't add a test for getter/setters on the context?  i mean, i'm seeing that it works now, but the ratchet is nice.

[01:09] scott_gonzalez: SubStack: thanks, I'll test it out

[01:10] Daegalus: Can anyone here help me with some jquery? its not related to Node though.

[06:40] AAA_awright: eddyb: Node.js really isn't the right type of framework for a traditional CMS, I should know, I'm writing one
[06:40] herbySk has joined the channel
[06:40] eddyb: AAA_awright: what are you writing?
[06:41] AAA_awright: Actually more of a framework, that happens to come with an application that serves HTTP webpages (though it could very well serve other things)
[06:41] AAA_awright: http://magnode.org/
[06:41] smathy: AAA_awright… by putting the word "traditional" in there, you've automatically validated your own argument.
[06:42] AAA_awright: Not in that sense, then, I mean in the sense that you can make a database query, send it to a template engine, generate a webpage and spit it out
[06:42] eddyb: AAA_awright: ok, so yours is nice
[06:42] eddyb: and somewhat more developed
[06:42] eddyb: can I suggest adding a theme :P ?
[06:42] AAA_awright: You _can_ like calipso seems to be doing but I don't think it's _wise_
[06:43] SubStack: frameworks are like when somebody hands you an unfinished project and says "here, finish this for me"
[06:43] AAA_awright: It's barely developed at all actually, ha
[06:43] SubStack: frameworks are really weird
[06:43] T-Co: AAA_awright, A pointer. If you're marketing a CMS for Web 3.0 you should really make an effort to look more like it too :) The website is *krhm* how would I put it... A little 90s style :D
[06:44] AAA_awright: My idea is create a framework that you can use to take inputs like database resources, an HTTP request object, a database row that describes a Blog entry, and so on, and produce a particular type of output that the browser asks for (usually text/html)
[06:44] ph^ has joined the channel
[06:44] AAA_awright: Web 3.0 seems to mean different things to different people, I mean the semantic web.
[06:44] AAA_awright: There's no theming that comes with it really... But I'm open to suggestions!
[06:44] T-Co: AAA_awright, Those two are not mutually exclusive, though

[06:46] tokuzfunpi has joined the channel
[06:47] SubStack: I want there to be so many libraries at so many different levels of abstraction that frameworks are entirely irrelevant
[06:47] Frippe has joined the channel
[06:47] AAA_awright: Oh, and once you have the framework, use it to create a simple, maybe hundred-line app/executible that works by default for HTTP
[06:47] AvianFlu: SubStack++
[06:47] v8bot_:  AvianFlu has given a beer to SubStack. SubStack now has 11 beers.
[06:47] SubStack: I'll call it the "npm framework"
[06:47] SubStack: just type npm init to get started
[06:47] zilch_: I am looking for job based on my experience with node.js and mongodb - with expectation that I will be able to devote my time ( 10 hr/week ) for my reasearch work !!
[06:47] k1ttty has joined the channel
[06:47] zilch_: what are the right places to search for 
[06:47] T-Co: AAA_awright, I like the synergy you have!
[06:48] zilch_: any suggestions from community
[06:48] Frippe has joined the channel
[06:49] AAA_awright: SubStack: You have to have the libraries first, which I'm finding out don't really exist for what I'm doing. Not for my transform idea I've developed, not for RDF or triple stores
[06:49] T-Co: zilch_, I would like that kind of a job too!
[06:49] SubStack: then build them?
[06:49] SubStack: then everybody can benefit
[06:49] AAA_awright: Exactly
[06:49] SubStack: not just the users of a framework
[06:49] AAA_awright: I have two libraries as submodules for that purpose
[06:49] SubStack: submodules -_-
[06:49] T-Co: zilch_, I actually sent email to &yet, not heard from those guys, though. Propably won't either because I'm from Finland :)
[06:50] SubStack: oh unless you mean in the non-git sense
[06:50] AAA_awright: Well hey, it lets you publish a package without the rest of the framework
[06:50] AAA_awright: No, in the GIt sense
[06:50] SubStack: -_-
[06:50] guybrush: SubStack: using the same style/libs project after project is like a framework somehow - others would call it boilerplate or sth
[06:50] AAA_awright: They're pretty awesome I think
[06:50] SubStack: why not package.json dependencies?
[06:50] SubStack: those are so much better in every way
[06:50] AAA_awright: That's npm-specific
[06:50] AAA_awright: Not everyone uses npm remember?
[06:50] joeyang has joined the channel
[06:51] guybrush: what? who doesnt?
[06:51] AAA_awright: At least I don't
[06:51] guybrush: you should :D
[06:51] zilch_: AAA_awright, using npm is highly recommended , right?
[06:51] SubStack: yes
[06:51] AAA_awright: I've been there before.
[06:51] AAA_awright: No
[06:51] AAA_awright: Noooooo
[06:51] SubStack: concurrent versioning
[06:51] SubStack: do eeeet
[06:51] zilch_: AAA_awright, what are your reason not to use it ?
[06:52] SubStack: use npm so your software doesn't break
[06:52] SubStack: and so others can use it
[06:52] AAA_awright: Git clone works just fine, especially since node_modules
[06:52] SubStack: if I can't `npm install` your thing I am not even going to care what it does
[06:53] guybrush: well its all about nodes awesome module-system, npm just makes handling it _very_ easy and thus fun
[06:53] AAA_awright: My reason is mostly historical, back when npm was a useless peice of crap that installed dozens of files to system directories that just appended values to "require.paths".
[06:53] ultramagnus has joined the channel
[06:53] AAA_awright: npm still can't figure out how to use symlinks in any beneficial way so I'm happy to do that by hand instead
[06:54] SubStack: npm link
[06:54] guybrush: symlinks inside modules?
[06:54] Morkel has joined the channel
[06:55] AAA_awright: No, symlinking module -> module.src/lib/ and module.src/lib/index.js -> (mainwhatever.js)
[06:55] groom has joined the channel
[06:55] AAA_awright: If people weren't already doing that
[06:55] AAA_awright: (Which you really should be using index.js)
[06:55] jacobolus has joined the channel
[06:55] AAA_awright: That lets you call require('module/subfile') too
[06:56] guybrush: right i like index.js - though its not an argument against npm :p
[06:56] SubStack: why would you even want to do that
[06:56] AvianFlu: that sounds like linking in a circle to require something you can already see

[06:58] T-Co: zilch_, I just figure that an US based company propably will hire native first...
[06:59] guybrush: it would be cool to have only very tiny modules (like 140byt.es) which depend on each other :D
[06:59] zilch_: T-Co, ah ... but they do sponsor visas with work permits , right ?
[07:00] T-Co: zilch_, Ah, but I won't be moving anywhere :)
[07:00] TomY has joined the channel
[07:00] konobi: AAA_awright: npm has a way of specifying the "main" file in package.json
[07:00] AAA_awright: Which is now a part of Node.js core, in the require() code
[07:01] AAA_awright: Isn't that just fantastic?
[07:01] JSManiacs: zilch_: Companies in the US tend to not sponsor visas unless they know the person being hired
[07:01] JSManiacs: zilch_: as in they know it will be a slam dunk
[07:02] konobi: *shrug* patches welcome =0)
[07:04] AAA_awright: The two big current issues I have (1) A single global namespace, (2) It has some notion of "engines" which aren't "packages" even though it's semantically exactly the same thing 
[07:05] SubStack: the engine field is just to signify what versions of node your package works in
[07:05] AAA_awright: (2) is just an oversight, that's fine, but (1) I can't tolerate for reasons relating to growing an ecosystem of packages specific to my mine
[07:05] zilch_: JSManiacs, guess if you have strong coding displayed on github ( hanging on the rim ) and created few popular modules ( broke the glassses ) ... you are slamdunk !!
[07:05] fangel has joined the channel
[07:05] AAA_awright: Oh, what I was trying to do is integrate a package manager into an interface
[07:06] garrensmith: is anyone else getting these errors with npm async@0.1.12 package.json: bugs['web'] should probably be bugs['url']
[07:06] T-Co: AAA_awright, You propably know. Is it possible to proxy socket connections trough nginx?
[07:07] konobi: _maybe_ there was a version released recently that has keep-alive support to backends
[07:07] AAA_awright: But without any way to say "Depends on https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql as 'mysql'" there's very little ways for me to go
[07:07] zilch_ has joined the channel
[07:07] AAA_awright: T-Co: Yeah, I use that, I have four instances of Magnode running behind Nginx to serve that
[07:07] AAA_awright: Which is way overkill but I have to make sure it works

[10:51] eddict: this can depend on the apache listening on a explicit interface 
[10:51] eddict: save bet is to go with the ip its listening on 
[10:52] eddict: but on a default setup with one network interface localhost should be fine

[12:55] zilch_: but any js shim is good i guess

[13:39] trose: okay....
[13:39] trose: >npm view n version
[13:39] trose: > 0.5.2
[13:39] trose: aikar n != node???
[13:39] Aikar: trose: no
[13:40] Aikar: its a utility to help install node
[13:40] Aikar: now type n 0.4.12
[13:40] trose: ah
[13:40] Aikar: and itll install 0.4.12 as your active node
[13:41] Aikar: tuhoojabotti: never really looked at nvm till now, just decided to use n since it was easy to install and by tj so i knew it was good, but nvm looks more annoying to use. npm install n -g once is rather simple, vs sourcing nvm files lol
[13:41] grekko has joined the channel
[13:41] trose: kk
[13:41] Aikar: and nvm is modifying PATH
[13:41] tuhoojabotti: huh
[13:42] tuhoojabotti: Aikar: You're mixing installing and using?
[13:42] tuhoojabotti: I don't get it.
[13:42] trose: aikar: thanks for all your help. I think i'm finally starting to understand the nodejs universe :D
[13:42] Aikar: tuhoojabotti: i meant you gotta source the nvm file everytime you open shell (which can be automated)
[13:43] trose: this shit is so powerful
[13:43] Aikar: where as n is a binary in PATH so it doesnt need that
[13:43] tuhoojabotti: Hmm
[13:43] tuhoojabotti: I do not remember such problem.

[14:55] Hammel: i'm a bloody noob at node and try to figure a out a nice structure for my project. my question is:  in what kind of way should the folders designed? i got a client/frontend and a server/backend (node)
[14:56] Hammel: and i tried to seperate it in a client and a server folder
[14:56] Hammel: server folder contianing node_modules etc.
[14:57] seqastian: also struggeling with that bigger picture design thing :]
[14:57] trose: So I'm trying to setup an express server with socket.io following this blog: http://www.danielbaulig.de/socket-ioexpress/ I'm not sure what I need to do on the client end to connect to this? The typical socket.io method of io.connect() doesn't seem to produce any response from the server

[15:04] ryanseddon has joined the channel
[15:05] Hammel: ok, there ends my knowledge :F im also new at node. i guess connection works fine but there is an error on server-side cause it should return the value (or did you replace ist with [hash-string]?

[15:07] gigawatt: and then get x on the server
[15:08] gxdssoft has joined the channel
[15:08] trose: Hammel, I think *maybe* i need to make the express server spit out the index.html page and then when that page tries to connect it'll be in the same session/ have a cookie? i'm not sure

[15:09] trose: gigawatt, hahaha I think we're having the same problem

[15:10] trose: gigawatt, are you using express with socket.io?
[15:10] gigawatt: but don't work, i tried getting the information on the authorization and the connection event
[15:10] gigawatt: no, im using socket.io alone
[15:10] gigawatt: deebus, im in both rooms
[15:10] Hammel: trose, i dont know sry :(
[15:11] Hosh has joined the channel
[15:11] trose: gigawatt, yeah we're on the exact same problem. What I'm going to try to do is server my index.html from the server itself and see if that sets the cookie/ auth info correctly
[15:12] trose: gigawatt, my intuition makes me feel like you shouldn't have to manually set that stuff
[15:12] Corren has joined the channel
[15:12] gigawatt: you should not need to go to that length, the client should be able to send connection based info at the start, especially for the authorisation part

[16:47] balaa has joined the channel
[16:47] Aikar: thats the beauty of copytruncate, doesnt need to close the file handle
[16:48] Aikar: it makes a copy of the file 'as-is' as the rotate, then empties out the current file
[16:48] Aikar: so all open file handles will be reset to the start of the empty file
[16:48] mattrobenolt: Gotcha.

[18:22] Aikar: runvnc: use same pem for both
[18:22] Aikar: pem = both of those keys combined into 1 file
[18:23] manouch: hi.. sorry for the probably noobish question... but when i access this script http://pastebin.com/kBR3cdUQ ... via chrome, it seems to handle two requests... the first one with the working given parameter... the second one fails: Cannot read property '0' of undefined

[18:27] Aikar: runvnc: a cert has multiple parts. a .crt file is the certificate itself, a .key file usually is the private key to sign the data that you dont want anyone to ever get ahold of. if you combine the key+crt file into one its then a .pem file which makes it easier to configure SSL for servers. then the CA who "signs" your certificate also has a certificate (godaddy in your case) which is what the ca: property is for
[18:27] heavysixer has joined the channel
[18:28] runvnc: aikar thanks
[18:28] runvnc: so could I just give the cert and key properties the actual .crt and .key files instead of both pems?
[18:28] Aikar: yes
[18:28] runvnc: I think what I was missing was the ca: property
[18:28] Aikar: a pem is just those 2 combined together
[18:28] runvnc: thanks guys
[18:29] Aikar: make sure you use YOUR .crt for the Cert field and godaddys .crt for the ca: field, dont mix them up.

[20:12] EyePulp: if I'm using node-redis, is there a smart way to handle getting several hashes in a synchronous fashion?   i.e. I need a value stored in one of two different hashes, so I'm trying to avoid a ton of nested calls to get the value, e.g. look through this list of hashes, and grab the value, then do something with it.

[20:18] ben_alman: they are different
[20:18] tjholowaychuk: jellosea x || 'default' is usually fine depending on what you want
[20:18] tjholowaychuk: obviously it'll fail if you pass 0 etc
[20:18] ben_alman: if x is not undefined, but still falsy (0, empty string, NaN, null, false) the former will revert to the default
[20:18] tjholowaychuk: but for example options = options || {}
[20:18] tjholowaychuk: is fine
[20:19] ben_alman: x || default is adequate when you are passing a boolean or object

[20:27] jgornick has joined the channel
[20:27] kurmangazy: someone tell me if there is a solution to this problem in node, because if not, I think it needs one:
[20:28] kurmangazy: if you are reading data from one stream and sending it right out another, you have to handle the fact that either side can be slow -- requiring you to pause() the fast one. this is taken care of by pipe()
[20:29] kurmangazy: but what if you are reading data from a stream, then translating it in some way, then writing the translated version out another stream
[20:29] kurmangazy: you can't use pipe() to handle pausing the fast stream for you
[20:31] kurmangazy: is there some equivalent of pipe() that handles this on your behalf?
[20:31] context: kurmangazy: you might be able to with event 'pipe'
[20:31] kurmangazy: context: what's that?
[20:31] context: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.12/api/streams.html#event_pipe_
[20:32] jsurfer_ has joined the channel
[20:32] context: i dont know if that lets you modify/'translate' though
[20:32] context: quick way to test it htough of course
[20:32] kurmangazy: I don't think that event helps
[20:33] kurmangazy: a simple solution that I can see would be if you can tell node that the streams are linked, so that if one underflows, it will pause the other automatically

The version we are using is probably 2 months old.  Thanks.
[20:34] Jho_: fastStream => pipe() => buffer() => translate => slowStream ?
[20:34] kurmangazy: like outputStream.link(inputStream) // <-- works just like pipe() but doesn't shovel the data for you

[20:35] tjholowaychuk: markdaws sounds like you're maybe not responding at times
[20:35] CarterL has joined the channel
[20:35] Jho_: just an idea to use pipe() functionality to connect to a third "buffer" stream, which you would then translate and stream out to the slower connection as fast as it can handle it
[20:35] kurmangazy: Jho_: so there's a memory buffer that acts as the endpoint for pipe(), and if it fills up, node pauses the input for you?
[20:36] Jho_: i don't know for sure, just thinking out loud
[20:36] kurmangazy: Jho_: oh so that's not something that exists, it's just a proposition?
