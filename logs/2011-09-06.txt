[03:28] crescendo|laptop: chilts, what are the delineations? 
[03:29] chilts: generally, if it's outside a function, it'll persist, if it's inside it won't - but this is a simple view, you should learn about variable scoping in JavaScript
[03:30] chilts: it'll depend on what you want to do and also why you want to do it, will presumably then make you figure out how to do it :)

[04:45] tbranyen: its one of those things thats like, sure its cool to read live from a repo everytime someone hits your site, but its so wasteful, i need to def build a cache tier

[04:45] Hodgestar has left the channel

[05:47] jiggliemon: Got's me a File-system question....
[05:47] jiggliemon: http://pastebin.com/bgsQDZHH
[05:47] jiggliemon: Does it make sense to do this?
[05:48] jiggliemon: I mean, If I want the files to be available to use after they're all parsed...
[05:48] jiggliemon: via some callback.
[05:48] jiggliemon: I was thinking it makes more sense to read the files recursively. 
[05:50] boaz has joined the channel
[05:50] tmzt: what's the problem?
[05:52] jiggliemon: Since it's asynchronous, there's no telling when all the files are read.
[05:52] jiggliemon: So it would make more sense to chain the file reading with some sort of recursive function.
[05:54] noodlehaus has joined the channel
[05:55] jamescarr: jiggliemon, heh.. I've hit this problem several times actually
[05:55] jamescarr: jiggliemon, each time I always copped out
[05:55] jiggliemon: went sync?
[05:56] jamescarr: nah... other ways of doing it that fit each individual situation
[05:56] jamescarr: versus coming up with a good generic solution
[05:56] jiggliemon: I don't really want to do a chain of loaded files (although that might save me some IO).  Cause it would be faster to load them all at the same time.
[05:57] jiggliemon: So I was thinking about setting a switch, and firing an event when they were all loaded.
[05:57] jamescarr: jiggliemon, one second, one of my solutions might've helped you
[05:57] jiggliemon: if(files.length == files.loaded)...
[05:58] jamescarr: yeah, track the lengths, 
[05:58] jamescarr: and count away
[05:58] shanebo: jiggliemon, what are you trying to do?
[05:58] jamescarr: jiggliemon, sorry, my situation was an async operation that, well, needed to happen synchronously ;)
[05:58] noodlehaus: you can try using one of the sync modules out there
[05:59] jamescarr: I was operation on a collection of 90,000 records and each save operation was making a new http request 
[05:59] jiggliemon: shanebo: re-writing the packager-node project to remove this "step"
[05:59] noodlehaus: then chain the operations
[05:59] shanebo: jamescarr, you ever run into a situation where two node projects on localhost kill each other's sessions?
[05:59] jamescarr: shanebo, no. You using redisStore?
[05:59] shanebo: I'm using connect
[05:59] shanebo: http://senchalabs.github.com/connect/middleware-session.html

[06:00] shanebo: nope
[06:00] jamescarr: you should
[06:00] jamescarr: :-P
[06:00] jamescarr: otherwise you will lose sessions on each restart
[06:01] jamescarr: if you're using nodemon this means you will always lose em
[06:01] shanebo: I already came up with a hack for that in dev

[06:02] sivy has joined the channel
[06:02] shanebo: for example if app A has a sessions with data and I go refresh app B, app A's session gets killed

[06:02] jetienne_ has joined the channel
[06:02] noodlehaus: something like /item/<mongodb id here>
[06:02] jetienne_: hi

[06:04] jamescarr: SpringJS
[06:04] noodlehaus: ok, thanks shane
[06:04] shanebo: yw
[06:04] shanebo: jamescarr, do you think my sessions getting killed is due to both apps being on localhost?

[06:14] jamescarr: the default is in memory
[06:14] jamescarr: so there's no reason for them to intefere
[06:16] shanebo: jamescarr, are sessions between computers handled dynamically or do you handle that?
[06:16] tmzt: are you just running on two different ports?
[06:16] shanebo: tmzt, yes

[06:17] tmzt: I could be wrong though

[08:21] Nexxy: I've seen as high as CS3 working in wine
[08:22] Nuck: Wow
[08:22] chjj: Nuck: i agree, ive never liked the UI, it should be fixed with the next version
[08:22] Nuck: I wonder if I could get CS5 in Wine
[08:22] Nuck: chjj: Orly?
[08:22] radiodario: what do you need CS5 for?
[08:22] Nuck: Full redesign?
[08:22] Nuck: Design work
[08:22] chjj: Nuck: yeah, theres a single-window mode for the next version
[08:22] radiodario: i mean over CS3
[08:22] Creap: So I found a module which supplies the functions I want, but it doesn't export to the global scope, so I have to do maddy = require 'maddy' / maddy.forEach(arr, do)
[08:22] Nuck: chjj: But is the UI as awful
[08:22] Nuck: radiodario: hardware acceleration, primarily
[08:22] chjj: ok
[08:23] radiodario: ok ok
[08:23] Creap: Just "require 'maddy'" didn't do anything really. Can I get it to the "global" scope somehow..?
[08:23] Nuck: I was debating doing a hackintosh for a while
[08:23] sfoster has joined the channel

[08:24] chjj: ;)
[08:24] Nuck: Not in this case
[08:24] Nuck: It's disagraceful to put ANYTHING on this
[08:24] Nuck: It's a broken piece of shit HP
[08:24] Creap: H4ns: yeah, lots of functions though. I could modify the module, I just thought if there was maybe a way when requiring stuff
[08:25] sriley: osx would suit it perfectly then ;)

[08:25] Nuck: OS X is a beautiful OS
[08:25] H4ns: Creap: you can also loop over the module object and import everything into your own scope.
[08:25] chjj: ACTION vomits
[08:25] Nuck: The designs are so elegant
[08:25] H4ns: Creap: in general, i'd not do that.
[08:25] Nexxy: lol
[08:25] sriley: im not so convinced at that
[08:25] Nuck: Only thin that irks me about OS X is the switching of Command and Control
[08:25] Nuck: It confuses me so much
[08:26] chjj: "design" "elegant" and "os x" do not belong in the same train of thought
[08:26] sorensen: eh?
[08:26] Nuck: I would probably map those to eachother if I got a Mac
[08:26] Nuck: I'm sure there's ways of doing that
[08:26] raj has joined the channel
[08:26] Creap: H4ns: The module checks if the functions are already defined, but I guess it could still be considered bad practice
[08:26] sorensen: i switched command and control the first day i got my macbook
[08:26] Nuck: chjj: Have you ever used a Mac?  They're the best -designed OS.
[08:26] Nuck: sorensen: haha, I will too

[12:28] jetienne_ has joined the channel
[12:28] socketio\test\99 has joined the channel
[12:29] chjj: sfoster: the connect static middleware works in such a way that if it doesnt find a request file, it will keep travelling down the stack, until it reaches the end, and then it will respond with a 404
[12:29] chjj: sfoster: it does it that way so you can put the static middleware at the top of your stack if you want
[12:30] chjj: a requested file*
[12:30] chjj: sfoster: but if the static middleware doesnt find anything, it pretends everything is okay for the time being, until you hit the end of the stack
[12:31] sfoster: ok, that makes sense
[12:31] sfoster: so I can put a simple middleware after it to resolve the request to a path and send back 404 my way if it doesn't exist
[12:33] adambeynon has joined the channel
[12:33] sfoster: I see it doing a stat on the file path, but it doesn't seem to emit anything. Seems a waste to do the whole thing all over again
[12:33] chjj: sfoster: what are you doing exactly?
[12:33] scott_gonzalez has joined the channel
[12:34] chjj: sfoster: yes, it stats to see if the file exists, which is why its usually recommended to put the static middleware at the bottom of your stack

[15:00] PS86K: what is the best port to use for webSocket? the problem is when i use 3g connection is not work, i don't now why, normally I use server.listen(8015);
[15:00] erock: Speaking of Auth, has anyone in here implemented an oAuth Provider using node.js? My team is going to use Rails to do it, but I'm thinking we should use Node.
[15:00] mwu: I'm attempting to run a process from a node.js script using child_process.spawn. I am getting exit code 127 with means 'command not found' -- I have checked my path and the binary does exist on my path and I can run it from the command line. Any ideas why this might happen?
[15:00] bnoordhuis: PS86K: there's a fair chance your 3g provider is blocking non-http traffic

[15:01] sivy_ has joined the channel
[15:01] bnoordhuis: PS86K: websockets don't work well with proxies and firewalls and that's what most 3g networks sit behind

[15:02] PS86K: hmmm :/ ok
[15:02] TheJH: mwu, use its full path
[15:02] PS86K: tks ;)
[15:02] erock: cronopio: i've done a bit of research on github and google in general. It seems possible enough, but I'm wondering if we will need to build the flow ourselves for the provider. Everyauth seems very mature as an oAuth client, but does it also act as a Provider?

[15:46] drack0: hello all have a good day, i just wanted to know what is the best setup for node.. i had a look to nvm (like an incomplete rvm for ruby) and  nave, so what you think is the best setup?
[15:46] brainproxy: drack0: I've had good experiences with nvm, which installs not only node but also npm
[15:47] dmkbot has joined the channel
[15:47] DrMcKay: this instance should be more stable ^

[15:47] drack0: on nvm you can create a similar file to the .rvmrc file in rvm ?

[15:48] Illusioneer has joined the channel
[15:49] brainproxy: no, I don't think so, at least I never have; but the way npm and the node_modules lookup work, I don't think too much customization is needed

[15:53] slloyd has joined the channel
[15:54] drack0: for example to run on one app a different set of npm packages, or node versions
[15:54] brainproxy: well, npm favors localized module installation
[15:54] dgathright has joined the channel
[15:54] brainproxy: e.g. suppose you have ~/myapp
[15:55] brainproxy: then in ~/myapp you would `npm install` whatever you need

[15:55] TheJH: brainproxy, "favors"? I don't think there's another way.
[15:56] brainproxy: TheJH: true enough, though some people will still setenv NODE_PATH before invoking the node runtime
[15:56] TheJH: brainproxy, uargh, ugly!
[15:56] TheJH: brainproxy, but you have a point, yes :D
[15:56] brainproxy: TheJH: yah, I'm not defending it :)

[18:00] kenperkins: is there an elegant way to have node listen on the same port for multiple servers
[18:01] mattrobenolt: kenperkins: Not possible with anything. That's where vhosts come into play.
[18:01] kenperkins: vhosts meaning a second, third, etc virtualized os?
[18:01] mattrobenolt: No, similar to vhosts in Apache or nginx, whichever.
[18:01] lapfrog: kenperkins: no, it means you read the Host: field from the http header
[18:01] kenperkins: got it
[18:01] lapfrog: kenperkins: and serve files based on that
[18:02] kenperkins: that's what I was looking fo
[18:02] mattrobenolt: Here's a node.js implementation: http://coolaj86.info/articles/vhosts-with-nodejs.html
[18:02] mattrobenolt: I'm not sure if there is a better one or not.
[18:04] tylerstalder has joined the channel
[18:05] context: there is an addon for pow to handle node vhosts as well
[18:06] mattrobenolt: What I do is use Nginx as a proxy into my node app, and I handle the vhosts there. Then spawn each Node app on it's own port.
[18:06] ckpcw has left the channel

[18:07] lapfrog: you could just run shell scripts then
[18:07] lapfrog: what's the point of async?
[18:07] context: lapfrog: that question is extremely vague

[18:08] lapfrog: that means nginx is listening on the socket
[18:08] lapfrog: doing the async stuff itself

[18:09] lapfrog: well yeah but in this case it does it before node, and why would node need to do it anymore?
[18:09] context: lapfrog: he is saying he uses nginx cause handling vhosts in nginx is easier than maintaining some 'hack' node app to handle all his other apps
[18:09] context: most node apps are standalone to begin with.
[18:09] mattrobenolt: If you've ever worked with wsgi, node works almost exactly the same way.
[18:09] dshaw_ has joined the channel
[18:09] lapfrog: wsgi -> never heard of, sorry :)

[18:09] JaKWaC has joined the channel
[18:10] lapfrog: meh
[18:10] context: lapfrog: just cause nginx is in front of it doesn't mean nginx wont give node multiple requests at a time
[18:10] lapfrog: on the same port?
[18:10] mattrobenolt: Node just spawns a very simple http server. Typically another actual web server is sitting in front proxying back to the node instance.
[18:10] context: lapfrog: sure?
[18:10] mattrobenolt: So nginx or Apache, or Lighttpd is running on port 80, and your node app maybe on 8000.
[18:11] lapfrog: sorry, i just got into node, but have been doing async in C and libevent for a while :)
[18:11] mattrobenolt: Nginx will proxy the call back to port 8000 if you tell it to.
[18:11] context: lapfrog: i imagine most if not all people have nginx or other web server in front of node for any production environment.
[18:11] Daegalus: Can anyone look over this and tell me if there is a better way of doing this. I don't like the fact that I am still doing Mongo specific things in my main file: https://gist.github.com/0975b92f7a09d23aa0cf

[18:11] stagas has joined the channel
[18:11] gerad has joined the channel
[18:12] context: lapfrog: there is no reason nginx cant give node multiple requests at once if it gets multiple requests for it...
[18:12] mattrobenolt: Node doesn't come with all of the securities that something like nginx or Apache has.
[18:12] lapfrog: i guess i don't know how nginx works
[18:12] jhurliman has joined the channel
[18:13] mattrobenolt: Nginx can be looked at as a load balancer or proxy.
[18:13] context: nginx works like apache, it gets web requests and handles them....
[18:13] sivy has joined the channel
[18:13] mattrobenolt: It is meant to proxy into another running instance. Whether it's PHP running on fcgi, a Python app in wsgi, node, or serving static files, or any number of things.
[18:13] lapfrog: oh i see
[18:14] lapfrog: sounds useful for complex stuff
[18:14] mattrobenolt: Unlike Apache, nginx doesn't do any app processing.
[18:14] mattrobenolt: Apache can embed applications that run within it's processing space. Like a PHP app. That's why Apache uses a ton of RAM.
[18:15] context: lapfrog: nginx will handle any static requests faster than ANY app required to handle dynamic requests... why waste node's time serving css/js/image files when nginx/apache will do it better, and keep node available for handling requests its really needed for.
[18:15] mattrobenolt: Nginx requires your app to be running in some other fashion and expects to delegate requests into your app. Which node is geared for perfectly.
[18:15] mattrobenolt: That too. Let nginx take over the static files. :)
[18:15] hij1nx has joined the channel
[18:15] flou has joined the channel
[18:16] `3rdEden has joined the channel
[18:16] jhurliman: context, because you can do really cool things with static files served up from node, like pre-processing your css/js/images to minify, embed images as base64, convert all your js files into a single resource, etc
[18:16] context: lapfrog: and there is a good chance apache/nginx might notice requests as hostile/incorrect and reject them as well without wasting your apps time.
[18:17] jhurliman: but otherwise, nginx is a better file server
[18:17] context: jhurliman: yeah, but what retard is minifying css/js for every request.
[18:17] lapfrog: jhurliman: you can cache those on deployment
[18:17] jhurliman: context, no one? i didn't suggest that
[18:17] context: you minify it and write the damn file to disk
[18:17] context: and.... let nginx handle it
[18:17] mattrobenolt: jhurliman: You really think applications are constantly minifying things on the fly? That's why we have build scripts.
[18:17] jhurliman: mattrobenolt, no
[18:18] lapfrog: you probably think: generated images
[18:18] mattrobenolt: Generated images are one thing, but those can still get proxied past nginx into your app.
[18:18] zeiris has joined the channel
[18:18] context: lapfrog: you are still wasting nodes time on something nginx does better... and thats one less request at that time that node could better be spent doing something useful, like letting someone login, or post a comment, or submit a ticket, etc etc etc
[18:19] lapfrog: nginx can generate images dynamically?
[18:19] context: </troll>
[18:19] mattrobenolt: lapfrog: Technically, yes. Practically, no.
[18:20] lapfrog: anyway i'm not interested in making high-load http apps right now
[18:20] context: depending on this 'image' i would probably use an html5 canvas and not have the server do shit.

[18:21] lapfrog: all i want to do is a cube2 server with the new enet-js module for node, and with a bunch of features like http console, sql logging and retrieval, irc bot and maybe RPC

[18:23] mattrobenolt: Seriously, look into Redis. It's made for that shit.
[18:24] micheil: like irc and gaming are totally different, in many ways
[18:24] khmer: crap, it really looks like it doesn't. :(
[18:24] lapfrog: i don't really worry about that flooding thing
[18:24] context: subpub or just a queue table in any SQL server or a message delivery server
[18:24] khmer: i'm going about this completely the wrong way, aren't i
[18:24] context: lapfrog: there is a reason people split things up.

[18:24] cronopio has joined the channel
[18:24] micheil: unless of course your game is played via irc, in which case it'd make sense to do the two in the same process.\
[18:24] lapfrog: no, no :)
[18:25] context: lapfrog: ok still, you are being closed minded on purpose. stop trolling the room, or use your head... there is a bug in your irc code, "oh sorry everyone gotta take down the game and the website, and the irc bot to fix one small issue in the irc bot"
[18:25] context: lapfrog: its a game, who cares about that irc bot.
[18:25] lapfrog: well the admins for one
[18:25] lapfrog: besides
[18:25] micheil: admins are not your users.
[18:25] lapfrog: hm
[18:25] mattrobenolt: You want separate services.
[18:25] cconstantine_ has joined the channel
[18:26] lapfrog: the only thing i can think of is perhaps having the irc bot talk through a pipe with the rest of the app
[18:26] context: lapfrog: and any intelligent admin (i have quite a few years admin experience managing >dozen servers) you dont smash that much crap into one process. you break them up, so IF someone does hack one of them, they didn't just destroy EVERYTHING
[18:26] micheil: ACTION works for pusher, and we regularly do deploys to our administration site, but it's incredibly hard for us to restart / take down websocket servers as that'd mean disconnecting all connected clients and stopping them from getting their messages.
[18:26] micheil: ie, separation makes sense.
[18:27] context: lapfrog: you just gave your irc bot access to ALL your game data, someone find a big in your irc bot code, question, give them access to next to no data (what already gets posted to irc) ... or access to everything....
[18:27] micheil: lapfrog: what's the irc bot actually got to do?
[18:27] slyphon has joined the channel
[18:27] lapfrog: it basically prints out in-game chat and some in-game events
[18:27] lapfrog: and allows irc people to talk to in-game people
[18:27] varrg has joined the channel
[18:27] micheil: okay
[18:27] lapfrog: and irc people with a password to login to the bot and run some commands
[18:28] context: lapfrog: there is a reason even your os and desktop games are sometimes ran in multiple processes.. any game iD has created in the last 12+ years, even for single player runs a server and client process.
[18:28] bartt has joined the channel
[18:28] micheil: so, you would probably want to have the irc component just passing messages to a shared message broker for the game
[18:28] lapfrog: hm
[18:28] lapfrog: perhaps you're right
[18:28] lapfrog: i remember something about remote console from darkplaces
[18:28] mattrobenolt: Again, Redis. :)
[18:28] lapfrog: the irc bot basically connected to the remote console as a client
[18:28] micheil: mattrobenolt: redis isn't a magic bullet.
[18:28] context: lapfrog: thats a totally different subject
[18:29] context: anyways
[18:29] context: lapfrog: how young are you?
[18:29] lapfrog: right. that matters why?
[18:29] micheil: context: irrelevant
[18:29] lapfrog: i'm irrelevant years old lol

[18:29] context: micheil: it would define if he is in fact just young, or infact a troll.
[18:29] lapfrog: "how old are ya son? lemme show you how REAL javascript is done"
[18:29] mattrobenolt: micheil: I'm aware, but it is one of the tools that is fast enough to act as a transport of messages between processes without bloat.
[18:30] micheil: context: perhaps take a step back.
[18:30] sudsey has joined the channel
[18:30] lapfrog: I think I'll have some sort of control socket that reads and writes json
[18:30] micheil: mattrobenolt: yeah, I'm not saying it's not good, hell no, we use it extensively at pusher, but it's not the be-all and end-all.
[18:30] context: micheil: just his amazing way of jumping topics and spouting off comments that have nothing to do with what he is talking about and having 5 people talk about it for 10 more minutes is enough for me
[18:31] lapfrog: and the irc bot can just connect to that socket and read the chat json
[18:31] mattrobenolt: Right, but if these questions are being asked, Redis is a great start until you understand the needs better of your app.
[18:31] lapfrog: maybe i can make a protocol and an event mask, so that when a client connects to that socket, it only sends selected events
[18:31] context: we went from 'whats the point of async?' to 'whats nginx' to 'run everything in one process' to 'remote console'
[18:31] sudsey: hey anyone free to help a node.js noob?
[18:31] micheil: context: bringing age into this discussion is a very very bad idea, I know for a fact that the contibutors to node.js core have ranged in age from anywhere between 17 and probably 60
[18:31] lapfrog: im 26 if you must know
[18:31] Wa has joined the channel
[18:32] lapfrog: i do php development
[18:32] context: micheil: kk, you're probably right on that.
[18:32] varrg has left the channel
[18:32] micheil: which is why you may not know about certain technologies in certain fields.
[18:32] lapfrog: and i've been doing libevent development for this game server. currently it is written in C, C++, php, MySQL, html, js, css, and cubescript (lisp-like)
[18:32] lapfrog: and i figured i'd reduce it to js, mysql, html, css :)
[18:32] lapfrog: oh and irc
[18:32] micheil: ie, when I did php development, I certainly didn't know much about nginx.
[18:32] lapfrog: if that's a language >_>
[18:32] context: so you already have multiple process hitting you data at once... and you question it cause you're writing it in node
[18:33] lapfrog: i questioned nothing, i just told you my story, bro
[18:33] lapfrog: :)
[18:33] cronopio: sudsey: Im a n00b too, maybe we could help each other
[18:33] lapfrog: what about you guys? a/s/l pls?
[18:34] context: 3:22    lapfrog| but they have to access the same data
[18:34] context: 13:22    lapfrog| the irc bot, the http console
[18:34] context: sorry, you assumed.
[18:34] sudsey: hey crono
[18:34] lapfrog: i assume this low-use server will run fine with everything in one process :P
[18:35] lapfrog: but i'll try the control socket thing
[18:35] micheil: lapfrog: I'd probably say that it'd be a good idea to split the two apart, being a client and server in one can get really confusing (in all languages)
[18:35] context: sudsey, cronopio: you generally get better results if you skip the 'can i ask a question?' part
[18:36] zomgbie has joined the channel
[18:36] micheil: sudsey: cronopio, could you repeat your questions?
[18:36] sudsey: ok, well anyone here know how to populate a drop down list with a file in nodejs, scraped the web and found nothing
[18:36] lapfrog: that's what i'm doing - the core will be the game server, and the control socket server. the control socket will be a JSON pipe-thing
[18:36] context: lapfrog: it may be low-use. what happens in the future if it gets really busy? whats easier, having it be seperate processes to begin with, or attempting to split it into multiple processes later?
[18:36] sudsey: I remember doing it with js before with html...but that was a long time ago
[18:36] lapfrog: it won't, this is a lame game :))

[18:37] micheil: *question
[18:37] mattrobenolt: lapfrog: context: haha
[18:37] julien51: hey, is there any managed host for node.js that allows for more than port 80?
[18:37] context: lets talk about going on vacation to the bahamas for half a day, even though neither of us have the money.
[18:37] julien51: We would love to find a place where we can easily deploy our XMPP servers in nodes!
[18:37] lapfrog: i'm going on vacation friday to monday if everything goes well :)
[18:37] lapfrog: seaside
[18:38] micheil: julien51: hmm, not sure, I don't think so, unless joyent allow that some how.
[18:38] context: ... anyways
[18:38] sudsey: well say in nodejs u can write a body of htl txt, I went thro an example creating a text field, then being able to upload a picture
[18:38] julien51: micheil : thx buddy… this makes me sad.
[18:38] micheil: julien51: oh, right, it's you; hi hi.

[18:38] julien51: micheil: it's me, indeed :) 
[18:38] sudsey: well now I want a dropdown list instead, but instead of hard coding the options, I want to populate the options that are contained in a file
[18:39] julien51: context: well, these are not managed host
[18:39] context: julien51: or email whereever you are considering, i imagine they are willing to modify rules.

[18:39] micheil: sudsey: are you using anything like a templating language for node.js?
[18:39] deedubs_ has joined the channel
[18:39] julien51: context: they don't, but as a matter of fact, none of them exposes a port that is not 80 anyway
[18:40] sudsey: micheil: no, just plain node.js
[18:40] context: julien51: how do you know that?
[18:40] micheil: sudsey: you'd have to give me more.
[18:40] patcito has joined the channel

[18:40] context: julien51: you realize it may appear blocked cause nothing is listening on it?
[18:40] julien51: micheil : not sure I get the " probably safer to keep them close to your application servers" ?
[18:40] context: julien51: doesn't hurt to ask.
[18:40] micheil: julien51: yeah, as both need to punch holes in various load balancers and stuff
[18:41] Skola has joined the channel
[18:41] sudsey: micheil: http://www.nodebeginner.org/#head8 this is the tutorial I used
[18:41] julien51: context: I do realize, and I have tested and I can safely connect "locally" from the server, to the server on port 5222 (which is what I need), but I can't access it from here (anywhere outside).
[18:41] micheil: julien51: okay, maybe I'm interpreting the question differently based on my prior knowledge?
[18:42] harthur has joined the channel
[18:42] sudsey: micheil: So, you end up with a basic httpserver, that allows u to upload a picture and then it echos it back (shows it again), I want to change it so you can selet options from a dropdown list on what country u r from
[18:42] vampi-the-frog has joined the channel
[18:42] vampi-the-frog has joined the channel
[18:42] julien51: micheil: to be honest, I'm not sure why they have to enforce a different behavior for port 80
[18:42] micheil: julien51: like I said, it's due to load balancer configurations
[18:43] DrMcKay has joined the channel
[18:43] julien51: micheil: yeah, I guess....
[18:43] micheil: your application actually runs on some sort of randomly assigned port, and then the load balancer is the thing that listens on port 80
[18:43] sudsey: Micheil: but I want the dropdown list (from which country you select your from) to be populated by a file
[18:43] zeade has joined the channel
[18:43] mehlah has joined the channel
[18:43] arthurdebert has joined the channel
[18:43] julien51: micheil: but I guess they could do the same for 5222 :)
[18:44] micheil: sudsey: ah, right. So, I'd actually store that file as an extra module that you require()
[18:44] micheil: then you load it up initially and then it's just like working with an array of items
[18:44] micheil: julien51: it's a lot harder.
[18:45] sudsey: micheil: you can assign the contents of a file to a var...but don't know what to do after that
[18:45] julien51: micheil; why is that?
[18:45] micheil: julien51: because of the way that the load balancers would more than likely work.
[18:45] sudsey: micheil: like assign the data to the options of a dropdown list?
[18:45] micheil: julien51: I think a couple of people to talk to would be people like the folks at nodejitsu, or joyent.
[18:45] losing has joined the channel
[18:45] micheil: julien51: as in, open a support request with them

[18:46] cronopio: sudsey: you have some code all ready?
[18:46] micheil: julien51: personally, I'd go joyent over nodejitsu, but ey'
[18:46] kmiyashiro: joyent is free?
[18:46] julien51: micheil : tried joyent, but there is no one in their support irc and no answer to email :/
[18:46] micheil: sudsey: uhh, more then likely some form of string concatenation.
[18:47] micheil: julien51: hmm, when was this? they've been quite busy with node knockout of late, I'd say try again.
[18:47] [Null] has joined the channel
[18:47] sudsey: micheil: hmm ok, I'm just surprised there isn't some help on the net

[18:55] khmer: any given example could probably be achieved in another language or framework, but the callback pattern in JS is especially easy
[18:55] bartt has joined the channel
[18:56] mattrobenolt: You can get away with the same functionality in other languages like Python or Ruby, it's just not as intuitive for some as Javascript. Plus, Javascript from the beginning is based on callbacks and being event driven, unlike Python or Ruby or PHP for that matter.

[18:58] mattrobenolt: joeytwiddle: The argument is a difficult one in general. It has been going back and forth for years. I prefer to just stay out of it. :)
[18:59] hermanjunge: but python is configured to do two tabspaces i autoindent
[18:59] hermanjunge: and I have to press <del> everytime I press <enter>... sucks
[18:59] hermanjunge: I'm in python.vim in the vim72/indent directory, but to be honest... I can't understand the script
[18:59] softdrink: here's part of my .vimrc  https://gist.github.com/c4cddb1c4f4b8646bfff

[19:34] cconstantine_: is there anyway to have node timeout callbacks that take too long?
[19:36] dshaw_1 has joined the channel
[19:39] Raynos: cconstantine: not really, you can hack the C++ layer though
[19:39] Raynos: I mean for HTTP there is a timeout build in, the same for TCP
[19:39] Raynos: but not for generic callbacks
[19:40] edude03 has joined the channel
[19:40] cconstantine_: Raynos, hmm, I've got few active callbacks and one of them is getting into an infinite loop
[19:40] m00p has joined the channel
[19:40] cconstantine_: Raynos, effectivly stopping the whole server
[19:41] Raynos: infinite loop?
[19:41] Raynos: Your talking about recursion
[19:41] cconstantine_: Raynos, and I'm not sure the best way to figure out where this infinite loop is (the callbacks interact with with each other so I can't just disable all but one)
[19:41] Raynos: Oh, one of your callbacks has a while(true) loop
[19:41] cconstantine_: Raynos, nothing like a while(true), but I do iterate over various datastructures
[19:41] Raynos: Well time to debug it ;)
[19:42] Raynos: and write unit tests
[19:42] Raynos: that _finish_ ;)
[19:42] cconstantine_: oh, I've got unittests
[19:42] cconstantine_: rather complete ones
[19:42] Raynos: Unless you want to run arbitary code you shouldnt have infinite loops
[19:42] Raynos: I did look into running arbitary source code on a server and dealing with code taking too long and being infinite
[19:42] cconstantine_: I have no while(true) type infinate loops
[19:42] Raynos: The way to handle that is either process.fork or run it in a REPL
[19:42] _kud has joined the channel
[19:43] cconstantine_: but if I somehow managed to create a cycle in some of my datastructues it would result in an infinate loop

[20:48] ryah has joined the channel
[20:50] halcyon918: Raynos: correct me if I'm wrong, but REPL will create a separate process and the parent and child process won't be able to communicate between them, right?
[20:50] halcyon918: I'd like the child to emit events the parent process can listen for, which I can do with the VM
[20:51] Raynos: Last time I read the source it didnt create a process but just a VM

[20:52] Raynos: pipe code in, output of code comes out ;)

[20:53] halcyon918: rule = run
[20:55] halcyon918: I can send a message to the long-running code to tell it to shutdown, but that assumes it's listening ;)

[21:33] abjorn has joined the channel
[21:33] mrdoodles: Daegalus: yeah, mongoose uses mongo native driver.

[22:01] Sidnicious: I don't think toArray takes any arguments other than the callback
[22:02] Daegalus: Then i guess i ma back to my original problem ofhow to pass additional parameters into the callback from ToArray so i can send stuff out
[22:02] Daegalus: i am *
[22:04] Sidnicious: In JavaScript, every function has access to the scope where it was created (i.e. where the word "function" is). See jerrysv's gist.
[22:04] elijah|home has joined the channel
[22:05] Daegalus: Sidnicious: the problem is its not working, when it finally gets to the callback function, and calls the renderer, the renderer has null req/res
[22:05] Sidnicious: Daegalus: could you post an example?
[22:05] Daegalus: Sidnicious: once sec let me get it in gist

[22:22] Daegalus: what the best Mongo admin UI? for Windows preferably? I need something to edit my mongo so I can create the database structure.
[22:22] odyniec has joined the channel
[22:22] mrryanjohnston: Daegalus: that's kind of unnecessary
[22:23] Daegalus: yes, I know I can use the shell, but I want something graphical, especially since I dont know all of mongo's commands yet
[22:23] greg__ has joined the channel
[22:23] mrryanjohnston: Daegalus: I mean, you don't really need to do that. You could just use mongoose or a similar module
[22:24] mrryanjohnston: Daegalus: you don't need to define any models via the cli
[22:24] Daegalus: mrryanjohnston: oh I can use my current module. I jsut like to graphically set it up and then write the necessary code to create it.

[22:24] mrryanjohnston: Daegalus: hm. just seems a little unnecessary to me ;)
[22:25] Daegalus: Ya, I know I can create it using the actual modules, but I want to get a nice structure and see what I can do with it graphically. Like setitng up references between stuff
[22:26] mrryanjohnston: Daegalus: this isn't a relational database; it's document oriented
[22:26] bicranial has joined the channel
[22:27] Daegalus: I know it is. I have 3 collections. Forums, Threads, and Posts. I want each Forum document to have teh references for all the threads in the Threads collection that are in it. and same with Posts. I want the Threads to have References to all the posts in them.
[22:27] bluesmoon: what is the default keep-alive timeout for node's http module?
[22:27] thinkt4nk has joined the channel
[22:27] brainproxy: Daegalus: if you need to create and query complex relationships between documents in the db, you might want to look at a graph database
[22:27] Daegalus: its nothing complex, its a simple tree setup
[22:28] brainproxy: OrientDB for example; haven't used it yet myself, but have been fascinated by the discussions around it
[22:28] mrryanjohnston: Daegalus: i understand. you don't need to do the relations though, and it'd really work better in a document-oriented database structure to do embedded documents
[22:28] mrryanjohnston: Daegalus: http://mongoosejs.com/docs/embedded-documents.html
[22:29] Daegalus: mrryanjohnston: i was asctually thinking that. But then if I query for a Forum for say the forum index. and say it has 1000s of threads, and 1000s of posts, would that return be massive?
[22:29] jerrysv: Daegalus: there is mongohub
[22:29] mrryanjohnston: Daegalus: potentially, but document oriented dbs are meant to be quite fast.
[22:29] jerrysv: dunno if it works in windows
[22:30] jerrysv: mrryanjohnston: you'd be shocked the performance i get out of a well tuned postgres implementation with partitioned tables and partial indexes
[22:30] Daegalus: jerrysv: mongohub is mac only. I have it on my laptop, i just didnt feel like going to go get it, and rebooting it into the mac partition to use it
[22:30] jerrysv: Daegalus: sorry, i'm mac and linux only, don't follow these weird platforms :)
[22:30] mrryanjohnston: jerrysv: I might not be too shocked ;) he was asking about document-oriented dbs, though; don't make it do something it's not meant to do

[22:31] jerrysv: mrryanjohnston: indeed, i was just referring to your general comment about how document oriented dbs are meant to be quite fast :)
[22:31] jerrysv: mrryanjohnston: and they are, for certain things
[22:32] jerrysv: mrryanjohnston: for instance, dynamic views in couchdb -- not so fast usually
[22:32] Daegalus: mrryanjohnston: yes i know its fast, but why have document referencing implemented in mongodb at all then? I mean it has built in Referene type to reference another object in the DB be it in the same collection or a different one. Also If i say have a ton o fusers logged in, and all of them are querrying a forum with lots of data, thats a huge bandwidth sink. Why load an entire forum worth of threads and posts for 1 thread? or even 1 
[22:32] Daegalus: post?

[22:34] Daegalus: eh, I understand what you are saying, but this is a Forum, it can potentially have massive datasets, its why I want to use referencing, to keep it streamlined

[22:38] NuckingFuts|Away: References are far slower than embedding, since embedded objects are colocated
