[00:01] broofa: Anyone here familiar with Nodes DNS lookup code?  I've got an HTTP load test tool I'm writing that starts spitting "ECONNREFUSED, Could not contact DNS servers" after the 250th http.Client I create.  Any idea what might be causing this?

[00:05] pquerna: broofa: what os, what dns server?
[00:05] EyePulp: is there a proper/elegant way to implement something akin to a jquery style $.extend() in node?
[00:05] broofa: pyrotechnick: macosx.  weird thing is this was working earlier. had 1,000 connections open. :P
[00:06] pyrotechnick: EyePulp: i think there's an exten in util
[00:07] pyrotechnick: EyePulp: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.3.4/api/util.html#util.inherits
[00:07] pyrotechnick: EyePulp: you can just include jquery in node though
[00:07] pyrotechnick: google it
[00:08] pyrotechnick: there's also underscore etc which have extension and inherits helpers
[00:08] EyePulp: pyrotechnick: I'll look at inherits - I'm hoping to avoid any big inclusions for this somewhat minor need  =)   thanks for the pointer
[00:09] pyrotechnick: just rip it out of jquery then

[02:21] kriskowal: i wasn't aware that the style you're using or __defineSetter__ were implemented in v8.
[02:21] bitdrift: so what's the deal with query string parsing in v0.2 to v0.3 ...it looks like v0.2 parses full paths inferred from dots (.) and v0.3 doesn't?  was that intentional, or is it just a work in progress?
[02:21] kriskowal: they're both in spidermonkey though.
[02:22] jmcneese: it says that all ecma5 setter/getter methods (including set()/get()) are in v8

[04:08] pyrotechnick: it's not what it is
[04:08] pyrotechnick: it's what it can be
[04:08] pyrotechnick: that's why people buy stuff like heroku

[04:18] SubStack: ah
[04:18] echosystm: eg. TypeMismatchError

[06:25] Figaroo: I'm thinking of just quiting PHP cold turkey and going with Node.js. What do you think, and can Node.js replace all everything I can do with PHP?
[06:25] Aria: Yes. They're both turing complete.

[06:51] bitdrift: ok so the query string parsing strategy in v0.2 makes it impossible to parse some openid requests
[06:52] bitdrift: for instance, i can have both openid.ns=foo and openid.ns.ext1=bar in the same query string
[06:53] SubStack: it's not too hard to write a parser for that
[06:53] bitdrift: SubStack: correct, in fact it's already done in the v0.3 branch
[06:53] bitdrift: BUT
[06:54] bitdrift: i imagine the v0.2 branch can't be changed without breaking a bunch of code out there
[06:55] bitdrift: so I'm wondering if it makes sense to have some sort of option to override the default parser?
[06:57] SubStack: just throw up a module oldquerystring on npm
[06:57] Figaroo: Is there a framework for Node that is similar to codeigniter in that it's view files are just HTML pages and you basically load them while passing data to them?
[06:58] isaacs: bitdrift: yeah, i agree.
[06:58] isaacs: bitdrift: the dot-separating stuff should never have landed, imo
[06:58] isaacs: no other system does that
[06:58] isaacs: the [] stuff is pretty cool, but not worth the complexity cost.
[06:58] SubStack: you could fix it with proxies >:D
[06:58] shaver: haha
[06:59] isaacs: actually, openid chose . *because* no platforms mess with it
[06:59] isaacs: pretty much all other punctuation is somehow relevant
[06:59] SubStack: or rather, hoxies, as I'm now calling them
[06:59] bitdrift: haha
[06:59] SubStack: everyone should call harmony proxies hoxies now, I've decided
[07:01] bitdrift: SubStack: what's this about proxies?
[07:01] bitdrift: is that like a plugin/module thing?
[07:01] SubStack: but I'm just guessing that v0.3 splits on dots to build a nested structure?
[07:01] SubStack: bitdrift: harmony proxies
[07:01] tylerstalder has joined the channel
[07:02] bitdrift: nope, actually v0.3 just keeps the strings whole
[07:02] SubStack: bitdrift: they're like operator[] and operator[]=

[07:23] perezd has joined the channel
[07:23] echosystm: the issue was getting the stacktrace to happen properly too... ive worked it out now
[07:24] herbySk: echosystm: Yes, util.inherits is fine, plus do not forget to put Error.apply(this, arguments) as the first statement in the constructor of subclass itself (or something other than Error, if you do nested subclasses)
[07:24] cadrlife has joined the channel
[07:24] echosystm: var MyError = function() { Error.captureStackTrace(this, MyError); }; MyError.prototype.__proto__ = Error.prototype;

[07:25] echosystm: thanks
[07:26] herbySk: echosystm: __proto__ is not standard :-), plus, util.inherits probably sets constructor right (but if you does not bother about constructor, what you've done is ok).
[07:28] echosystm: cool
[07:28] echosystm: thanks
[07:28] herbySk: echosystm: The 'canonical' way is to do MyError.prototype = Object.create(Error.prototype)

[07:29] echosystm: i'm just going to use inherits
[07:29] echosystm: :P
[07:29] echosystm: i had a question earlier though, perhaps you can shed some light on that too...
[07:30] echosystm: why does inherits add super_ ? whats the significance of the underscore?
[07:30] echosystm: sorry that was worded bad haha, i just want to know what the underscore is for
[07:30] echosystm: (just curious if it is some convention that i should be using myself)
[07:32] whyme: echosystm: nothing special, i believe
[07:32] herbySk: echosystm: It adds it for convenience for those who are used to have some accessor named "super" or "inherited" for the superclass, the underscore is used to denote "internal", "private" things -- here it was probably done mainly not to cause nameclash should someone use the "normal-looking" property super
[07:32] echosystm: ah
[07:32] echosystm: ok
[07:32] echosystm: shouldnt the underscore be at the beginning ? :P
[07:32] echosystm: _hidden seems to be the usual
[07:33] shaver: in C, underscore-leading is reserved
[07:33] shaver: so v8 code uses trailing
[07:33] echosystm: ok
[07:35] echosystm: so the inherits function runs in c, not javascript?
[07:38] whyme: echosystm: see: https://github.com/ry/node/blob/v0.3.4/lib/util.js#L390
[07:42] echosystm: so... just looking at those lib files
[07:42] echosystm: it seems modules that just export functions have their names_like_this
[07:42] echosystm: but modules that export 'classes' have nameslikethis
[07:42] echosystm: correct?

[11:10] ron_frown: eg, I want to have a couple 'url handlers" that an app can do http posts to, in addition to the socket send/recieve stuff
[11:10] sveisvei: e.g. a router?
[11:10] ron_frown: uhh I dont know
[11:10] ron_frown: is that what its called in node.js?
[11:11] sveisvei: expressjs does it like this. app.post("/url/to/post/to", function(req, res){//Return something})

[11:13] ron_frown: so I could have express in place with a couple urls defined
[11:14] ron_frown: and then have socket.io included and do io.listen and handle the events and not step on eachothers toes?

[12:28] ron_frown: I heard cygwin works but that there was a mingw version in the works or already there
[12:31] piscisaureus: ron_frown: cygwin build is usable, tho it's 0.2 branch only
[12:31] piscisaureus: mingw branch is in the works really
[12:31] ron_frown: that means progress but not usable at all
[12:31] DH1JC: I ddi build it today.
[12:31] ron_frown: ?
[12:31] piscisaureus: ron_fown: well, I can use it :-)
[12:31] DH1JC: so the 0.2.6 works fine... the 0.3.4 compiles (after applying a patch) but then segfaulted...
[12:32] DH1JC: sure useable... but not latest version...
[12:32] ron_frown: piscisaureus:  are you ry?
[12:32] ron_frown: 2.6 would work for me
[12:32] ron_frown: but running on cygwin sounds... highly undesirable
[12:32] piscisaureus: ron_frown: no. ry is ryah. But he should be asleep right now.

[13:28] booths: 0.3.1
[13:28] booths: It was running 0.2.6 as well, doing the same thing

[13:33] booths_: seems to have none at this time
[13:33] piscisaureus: hmm
[13:34] piscisaureus: I have seen problems where ENOBUFS on windows was caused by having too many sockets open
[13:35] piscisaureus: event if in node the socket was closed, windows keeps the socket in TIME_WAIT state for a long time
[13:35] booths_: The program basically is parsing XML that is posted to it and turning it into data, so there's a lot of regular HTTP POST connections happening, it just seems as soon as a regular browser connection happens
[13:36] booths_: And past socket.io, because it handles the initial connection, as socket.io connects
[13:36] dnolen has joined the channel
[13:39] piscisaureus: booths_: don't understand what you're just saying
[13:39] booths_: The regular http post requests don't connect to socket.io, is the only difference I can think of. I left the server running over night and those continued to work overnight.
[13:39] booths_: But when I connected this morning it died immediately.
[13:41] piscisaureus: I don't think that's it
[13:42] piscisaureus: The ENOBUFS originates here: https://github.com/ry/node/blob/v0.3.1/src/node_net.cc#L369
[13:42] ron_frown: if I wanted to include an external js file in node.js app
[13:42] ron_frown: do I just use require and plop the js file in the same dir?
[13:42] piscisaureus: apparently your program is trying to connect to some other something
[13:42] piscisaureus: that's where it crashes
[13:43] booths_: An outgoing connection from the server? Hmm...

[13:58] mape: Anyone here used spark to spawn multiple instances along with socket.io?
[13:58] piscisaureus: Can you also reproduce the crash?
[13:58] piscisaureus: Unfortunately there's not much you can do about the time_wait trouble with node itself
[13:58] piscisaureus: however you can change the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\TCPIP\Parameters\TcpTimedWaitDelay to a lower valye
[14:00] booths_: Haven't reproduced the crash yet
[14:00] m0rganic has joined the channel
[14:00] booths_: They sit in time_wait for a while, and there's multiple. They do fall off, but once I reconnect w/ the same client they all come back and sit in established
[14:00] piscisaureus: hmm
[14:01] piscisaureus: how many connections?
[14:01] booths_: 9 right now, I've refreshed a few times to get it that high
[14:01] piscisaureus: 9 is not much. that shouldn't hurt
[14:02] booths_: Hmm
[14:02] aelaguiz: hey what debugger do you guys use? I've tried to get eclipse & google remote debugger working and failed - is that the current best way?
[14:02] piscisaureus: how busy is that server normally, in terms of reqs per hour/sec/day?
[14:03] booths_: It'd in dev right now, but in production it'd probably be about 100-200 people using it constantly during business hours, and taper down to about 50 people over night.

[16:09] joemccann: brianc:  right...im using express and it doesn't pick it up by default
[16:09] brianc: joemccann: I believe it's still suggested to run with an nginx reverse proxy for better security anyway

I ask cause you know windows isnt that friendly with the idea of symlinks, and trying to put the

[18:52] Aikar: ;(
[18:52] isaacs: Aikar: that is, not likely, not any time soon.
[18:52] isaacs: Aikar: also, you can't put relative dirs in require.paths
[18:53] isaacs: Aikar: doesn't windows have some kind of symlink function?  /cc piscisaureus 
[18:53] Aikar: i tried writing a script that exported the copy of /active/package/ of each library to my folder but stuff like express expects the require('connect/middleware/router') to be there which wasnt in the package folder

[19:48] clarkfischer has joined the channel
[19:49] dthompson has joined the channel
[19:51] isaacs: jimmyjazz14: did you remove the iterators package and clean the cache before re-installing?
[19:51] jimmyjazz14: isaacs, yeah
[19:51] isaacs: hm...
[19:51] jimmyjazz14: pretty weird stuff
[19:51] isaacs: npm rm iterators ; npm cache clean ; npm install
[19:51] c4milo: isaacs: can I just added a new package source to npm?
[19:52] c4milo: isaacs: just like I can do with apt-get 
[19:52] c4milo: s/added/add/
[19:52] Aikar: hmm, whats syntax for a hot require, i thought it was require.hot ?
[19:52] bebbo has joined the channel
[19:52] isaacs: c4milo: i dont' understand teh question
[19:53] c4milo: isaacs: do you know apt-get?
[19:53] isaacs: c4milo: you want to publish something?  or install something?
[19:53] mikeal-iPhone has joined the channel
[19:53] isaacs: c4milo: a little yeah
[19:53] isaacs: oh, you want a new registry
[19:53] isaacs: c4milo: it only talks to one registry at a time.
[19:53] c4milo: isaacs: ohh I see 
[19:53] c4milo: isaacs: that would be a cool feature
[19:53] isaacs: c4milo: the registry is a couchapp.  you can replicate it if you want, or selectively replicate it.
[19:53] isaacs: c4milo: yeah, but it's very not easy.
[19:53] c4milo: isaacs: yes, I understand
[19:54] isaacs: c4milo: imagine writing a proxy server that gets requests and then routes them to the appropriate registry.
[19:54] isaacs: you'll get a request like /foo/1.2.3
[19:54] c4milo: isaacs: yeah, that could be a workaround 
[19:55] isaacs: c4milo: ok, now you get a PUT request.
[19:55] DewBoy3d has joined the channel
[19:55] isaacs: where do you write it?
[19:55] c4milo: isaacs: I wanted a similar behavior to gem —source 
[19:55] isaacs: if someone wants to go through the effort to explicitly detail how each edge case would work, i have no philosophical objection.
[19:55] isaacs: it's just not nearly as easy as it seems once you really dig into it
[19:55] jimmyjazz14: isaacs, having multiple repos would be nice
[19:56] isaacs: jimmyjazz14: yeah, sure.  the hard part is all the writing stuff.
[19:56] isaacs: and the reading is kinda tricky a lot of time,s too
[19:56] isaacs: you basically lose the referential consistency of the dependent relationships, and end up having to deal with conflicts, where before there were none.
[19:56] bebbo has left the channel
[19:57] jimmyjazz14: isaacs, could it not just ask you which repo you want to publish to?
[19:57] isaacs: jimmyjazz14: right.  perhaps you could specify that with the "registry" config ;{
[19:57] isaacs: ;P
[19:57] jimmyjazz14: ?
[19:57] isaacs: it means making all the registry stuff twice as complicated.
[19:57] isaacs: right now, it's like "what's the registry url?  great!  that's where i read from and write to!"
[19:58] mjr_ has joined the channel
[19:58] isaacs: it'd have to be "what are my registry urls?  which one do you want to write to?  what order should i try to read from them in?"
[19:58] isaacs: caching gets an extra layer of complexity, too
[19:58] isaacs: has to cache per-server rahter than just per-uri
[19:58] jimmyjazz14: isaacs, you just treat them all as one big repo
[19:58] isaacs: jimmyjazz14: that's not really an answer.
[19:58] jimmyjazz14: when reading
[19:59] isaacs: jimmyjazz14: i mean, i don't currently read from "one big repo".  i read from "one" repo
[19:59] jimmyjazz14: thats how most package managers do it
[19:59] isaacs: again, not saying it's impossible.  just that it's a lot harder than it looks.
[19:59] pdelgallego has joined the channel
[19:59] isaacs: npm does a lot ofthings that most package managers don't do.
[19:59] jimmyjazz14: they just get a manifest from all the repos and combine them locally into a kinda single repo
[20:00] isaacs: and referential integrity of dependency links is important.
[20:01] isaacs: jimmyjazz14: so, just as a very light first step, the smallest possible way to move in that direction:
[20:01] xla has joined the channel
[20:01] isaacs: supply a list of registry-read urls, right?
[20:01] jpld has joined the channel
[20:01] isaacs: when you try to look up something, if it's not in the first, try the second, etc.
[20:01] isaacs: 1. now needs to handle 404 responses differently.
[20:02] isaacs: 2. caching will be weird.  but i guess presuming that they're couchapps that replicate some or all of their data, ETag caching could still work, and you could still use one big cache.
[20:02] femtooo has joined the channel
[20:02] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[20:02] isaacs: 3. registry.GET("/") will *never* 404, and has to be smart enough to fetch from all of them and collate.
[20:03] isaacs: 4. registryA might have /foo, but not /foo/1.2.3.  registryB might have /foo but not /foo/1.2.4
[20:03] jimmyjazz14: isaacs, most package managers use some sort of 'update' like command to download the latest package manifest from the server then store the repo data locally
[20:03] isaacs: so, if bar->foo@>=1.2.4, and you request /foo to see what verions are available, again, you have to be smart enough to fetch from all of them and collate.
[20:03] isaacs: jimmyjazz14: right.  npm doesn't.
[20:03] isaacs: jimmyjazz14: it fetches the data as needed, and caches it by etag and date.
[20:04] jimmyjazz14: isaacs, perhaps it should though
[20:04] isaacs: i have a problem with invalid data :)
[20:04] isaacs: i also have a problem with storing more data than you need.
[20:05] isaacs: downloading a monolithic list of several thousand modules from multiple different places is stupid.
[20:05] isaacs: yes, yes, i know apt-get does it.
[20:05] isaacs: it's stupid when apt-get does it, too.
[20:05] creationix has joined the channel
[20:05] jimmyjazz14: isaacs, why?
[20:05] mikeal-iPhone: Where is creationix?
[20:05] isaacs: jimmyjazz14: it's slow.
[20:05] creationix: mikeal-iPhone: hey
[20:06] isaacs: jimmyjazz14: slow to read, slow to generate on teh server, slow to download, slow to store
[20:06] mikeal-iPhone: Creationix: I'm at the fairy building
[20:06] possibilities: anyone know... is there a guide for rates per hour for programming based on the area?
[20:06] possibilities: some database of average rate based on language and location, etc
[20:06] jimmyjazz14: isaacs, speed has never been a problem for me with apt
[20:06] creationix: ok, mikeal-iPhone do you have my phone number
[20:07] isaacs: jimmyjazz14: apt packages only have one version each.
[20:07] isaacs: jimmyjazz14: that is, you usually just download the "debian-stable" or whatever.
[20:07] jimmyjazz14: isaacs, one installed version maybe
[20:08] walkah has joined the channel
[20:08] walkah has joined the channel
[20:08] jimmyjazz14: but many versions are available in the repos
[20:08] isaacs: anyway, here's my point: npm's not gonna do it like apt.  different conceptual model, doesn't fit.  multiple registries are fine, but hard to implement.  if you wanna implement it, that's great, do it.

[20:09] isaacs: in teh meantime, there are bigger fish to fry
[20:09] isaacs: everyone who really cares a lot about this is already running their own registry, and it's easy to talk to any registry you want with the client, you just can only do one at a time.

[20:12] tjholowaychuk: FML
[20:12] tjholowaychuk: fuck lint crap man
[20:12] tjholowaychuk: wtf
[20:12] stride: hm. should node-utils/request do https requests on node 0.3.2 successfully?
[20:12] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: you are so far behind the times, man
[20:13] tjholowaychuk: lint is newbish lol its cool for detecting "real" issues
[20:13] tjholowaychuk: but thats about it
[20:14] russ_nyc: hi all, does anyone have experiance with http://caolanmcmahon.com/async.html
[20:14] qnt4b: where we looking here? node source?
[20:14] mgutz: russy_sync: i started using it
[20:15] russ_nyc: i am having trouble with the way it works. here is have my function http://pastie.org/1449679
[20:15] russ_nyc: and for some reason it just hangs.  it never makes to to the return statement
[20:15] qnt4b: the commas, I mean, and the putting of where...
[20:16] russ_nyc: im sure i am just doing something wrong here but i cant find any great documentation on how to set run the functions
[20:18] eee_c has joined the channel
[20:19] mgutz: the code looks right as far as i can tail. h
[20:19] mgutz: The code looks right as far as i can tell. 
[20:19] jimmyjazz14: isaacs, just tried it on another machine and I got the same problem
[20:19] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: so you guys changed all of node, just to support this closure thing?
[20:19] tjholowaychuk: :s
[20:19] bradleymeck: tjholowaychuk, just wait on a linter that includes parsing for "bad practices" on the ast level
[20:19] jimmyjazz14: isaacs, fyi they are both linux boxes if that matters
[20:20] tjholowaychuk: bradleymeck: well yeah I mean catching globals n shit is all good, but it doesnt take a genious to realise "a = b" should not be "a=b" if the rest of project is following the first style
[20:20] dsirijus has joined the channel
[20:20] tjholowaychuk: insanely overrated
[20:21] mgutz: however, the value of `return fails` is not likely valid since since the filter is an async operation 
[20:21] bradleymeck: hey, some projects i have submitted patches to delete them cause I forget to strip whitespace at end of line
[20:21] russ_nyc: well it never makes it to return fails
[20:21] gf3 has joined the channel
[20:22] russ_nyc: i just want to run all the engines in parrallel and if one fails then the entire function returns fail
[20:23] stride: \o/ [analytics] undefined (undefined Status: undefined Created: undefined): undefined
[20:23] tjholowaychuk: bradleymeck: yeah, its not like node maintains a graceful codebase though
[20:23] russ_nyc: but it gets to fails = results.length > 0 
[20:23] tjholowaychuk: it still looks like ass
[20:23] russ_nyc: and it hangs there
[20:23] qnt4b: oh I see, stripped commas from variable declarations, one-per now...
[20:23] qnt4b: bummer
[20:24] russ_nyc: it never makes it out of the loop
[20:26] bradleymeck: id rather have an ass looking codebase that follows sane design than some java stuff
[20:26] brianc: need moar singletonz
[20:27] tjholowaychuk: bradleymeck: yeah, but how is this linting any different than before, I dont see much of a benefit
[20:27] bartt has joined the channel
[20:27] tjholowaychuk: just me I guess
[20:27] pedrobelo has joined the channel
[20:27] tjholowaychuk: IMO that effort should go to cleaning up what we have now

[20:28] bradleymeck: tjholowaychuk, its not. its dumb, but meh. If someone wanted to hook up a pretty printer to it I think it would make more sense

[20:29] dsirijus has joined the channel
[20:30] mgutz: russ_nyc: here's a simple example of filter https://gist.github.com/775066

[20:37] russ_nyc: it isnt caliing itself, theres another object with the method of decide
[20:37] dsirijus has joined the channel
[20:37] russ_nyc: mgutz: do you think there is a better way that this to run each in parralel and return false if any of the return false?
[20:38] milar: Hello. is there anyone here that can help me with the following error that i get when i run cloud9. Tried using both provided bin and own build from stable version of node. everything fires up ok. but when i try to open up a folder this message shows in my terminal where i run cloud9.

[21:00] ben_alman: i've seen both a python script and bash script called "Diff2html"

[21:01] Prometheus: well surely there are scripts available in just about any language
[21:01] Prometheus: but pygments would make things easy
[21:01] ben_alman: i don't see one in javascript :)

[21:03] Prometheus: (and javascript, obviously)
[21:03] ben_alman: i don't
[21:03] ben_alman: never used python
[21:03] ben_alman: mostly js
[21:03] ben_alman: some php

[21:04] derferman_ has joined the channel
[21:04] tjholowaychuk: but .replace() with a function, then map the ansi escape codes to some classes on the tags you generate
[21:04] ben_alman: sorry, i'm talking about so many things at once
[21:05] ben_alman: yeah i thought about that too, the ansi codes aren't crazy by any means
[21:05] tjholowaychuk: its really easy if you only have to target a few codes
[21:05] ben_alman: yeah, git diffs aren't too crazy

[21:37] piscisaureus: ah, good
[21:37] piscisaureus: 1. you want patches floating on top of deps committed
[21:37] piscisaureus: i can do that for libev because it's a simple patch
[21:37] EGreg: hey
[21:37] EGreg: what's node.js up to these days, what's the roadmap?
[21:38] piscisaureus: but for libev it will be hard because there is so much
[21:38] piscisaureus: also freebsd and mac fixes - those aren't committed either
[21:38] piscisaureus: maintaining those patches in the repository will be a crime
[21:39] ryah: why?
[21:39] piscisaureus: why not do deps upgrades on a separate branch?
[21:39] ryah: piscisaureus: i don't know how to do that
[21:39] Anti-X has joined the channel
[21:39] ryah: how would that work?

[21:42] Remoun has joined the channel
[21:44] piscisaureus: A -B - C -D -E - M
[21:44] piscisaureus:       \ - C' ------ /
[21:44] piscisaureus: suppose B = the last time libeio was unpatched
[21:44] piscisaureus: C-E are commits on master, that may also affect libeio
[21:44] piscisaureus: now you do a libeio upgrade in C', then merge that commit in M'
[21:44] piscisaureus: Now if you want to upgrade libeio again, some time later, the next upgrade gets C' as its parent, and it is merged again, so it looks like this:
[21:45] piscisaureus: A -B - C -D -E - M - F - G - N
[21:45] piscisaureus:       \ - C' ------- / - D' -----/
[21:45] piscisaureus: Where D' is the new libeio upgrade and F,G are commits to master that may change libeio
[21:45] ben_alman: creationix: your node-git example shows Git.exists and Git.getTags .. but those methods don't even exist!
[21:45] ben_alman: do you have them in a branch or something?

[21:50] tjholowaychuk: bradleymeck: nope
[21:50] tjholowaychuk: no personal need for it
[21:50] piscisaureus: to bootstrap it, branch master before changes
[21:50] piscisaureus: then upgrade in that branch
[21:51] piscisaureus: now we have an upgrade commit X where the dep is upgraded but without node-specific patches
[21:51] charlenopires has joined the channel
[21:51] piscisaureus: this branch gets merged into master
[21:51] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[21:51] piscisaureus: now if you want to upgrade the same dep some other time, you switch back to X
[21:51] piscisaureus: there you do the upgrade
[21:51] bradleymeck: k that answers my questions then
[21:51] piscisaureus: then the upgrade branch gets merged to master, again
[21:52] piscisaureus: the node merge logic will make sure that you don't lose your node-specific patches
[21:52] piscisaureus: it's simple really
[21:52] piscisaureus: ehm node merge logic = git merge logic

[22:19] piscisaureus: ryah: If you need to do another libev upgrade, apply it on top of the `vanilla` branch, then merge that branch again
[22:20] piscisaureus: ryah: and to inspect everything that we're floating on top of libeio, just `git diff vanilla-libeio..master -- deps/libeio` does the trick

[23:00] mikeal: that one isn't the worst current thread tho

[23:01] mikeal: which is like
[23:01] bradleymeck: yep :), which is fine by me, as I can now link it

[23:01] bradleymeck: shhhh
[23:01] thedjinn has joined the channel

[23:03] mikeal: but if you think it's a blocker for the whole world, go ahead and build it
[23:03] stride: and we should rethink that <?node ?> approach

[23:47] piscisaureus: ryah: what should it do (defined in a platform-independent manner)
[23:48] mayfield: node.js is amazing!
[23:48] ryah: for example '\n' coming in will not print a line in the output
[23:48] echosystm: now, a pet hate of mine is the sort of thing that goes on in the CPAN world, where every cowboy does things 'their way'^tm
[23:48] ryah: \t rather
[23:48] piscisaureus: oh so disable echo?
[23:48] mayfield: the cloud server bindings are nice as well!
[23:48] ryah: so there are various options - right now we just have raw and normal
[23:48] pquerna: can someone else make a wsdl to node generator for me.
[23:49] pquerna: kthxbye
[23:49] echosystm: so i'm trying to get a better grasp of the node.js best practices and intend to write some kind of style guide from my findings

[23:49] mayfield: of course.

[23:49] piscisaureus: well we could define raw as 'no echo + ... ' but I need to know what exactly

[23:50] softdrink: damn.  can't seem to do generated css content around input placeholders
[23:51] piscisaureus: relevant ones:
[23:51] piscisaureus: * echo 
[23:52] piscisaureus: * line input (as opposed to char input)
[23:52] ryah: yes, yes
[23:52] ryah: (raw = char input)
[23:53] [[zzz]] has joined the channel
[23:53] piscisaureus: * insert mode (in line edit mode only)
[23:53] piscisaureus: * (mouse event)
[23:53] piscisaureus: * ctrl+c raw
[23:53] piscisaureus: * (select text with mouse)
[23:53] piscisaureus: * capture buffer size changes
[23:54] piscisaureus: for output
[23:54] ryah: capture buffer size changes?
[23:54] piscisaureus: * interpret backspace, tab, BELL, CR, LF on/off
[23:54] piscisaureus: * wrap at eol
[23:54] piscisaureus: is like sigwinch
[23:55] ryah: piscisaureus: anyway - just set some we'll need to play with them to get readline working
[23:55] piscisaureus: but it triggers if the buffer size changes (so not the console window but the underlying text buffer)
[23:55] ryah: but raw is basically no echo, char input
[23:55] Country has joined the channel
[23:55] ryah: wnat the ctrl+c too
[23:56] piscisaureus: yeah ok
[23:56] piscisaureus: should distinguish between output raw mode and input raw mode
[23:56] echosystm: ryah: quick question - what is your convention for package names? i noticed some are like 'some_name', while others use 'somename'. also, what do double leading underscores (eg. __somevar) and a single trailing underscore (eg. super_) signify?
[23:56] piscisaureus: but I don't think there is anything raw about output atm
[23:57] echosystm: i want to write my code in as similar way to the standard library as possible
