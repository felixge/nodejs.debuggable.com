[00:00] Dmitrijus: nicholasf: hehe, i would so want to have a local group here in amsterdam :(
[00:00] nicholasf: :)
[00:00] nicholasf: Im becoming addicted to node and want to invite some locals
[00:00] Brandon_R: :)
[00:00] Brandon_R: Hey dmitrijus
[00:00] Brandon_R: do you know how to use libuv?
[00:00] bingomanatee_: Dimitrijus: if you are going to start a group in Amsterdam you will be responsible with supplying the other international Node troops with "Inspiration"
[00:00] Brandon_R: or know of a project that uses it?
[00:01] mmalecki: Dmitrijus: there's a plan for European user groups
[00:01] mmalecki: if you want to, I can contact you with jvduf, he's there

[00:04] cmr: It's called "nodejs"
[00:04] Dmitrijus: bingomanatee_: i'm okay with making "inspiration", but generally i think it would just nice to have a beer once in a while with other node developers :)
[00:05] Brandon_R: :) i mean without the cryptic v8 stuff in it
[00:05] bingomanatee_: it does make a difference - thats why life in SF is zo fun. 
[00:05] booo has joined the channel
[00:05] Brandon_R: why don't you move to the us dmitrijus?
[00:05] bingomanatee_: Node camps are cool. You could organize those and get people from the larger region in. 
[00:06] bingomanatee_: << was not trying to imply people should all move to where he lives

[00:08] txdv: europe is good, because the crazies are not as crazy as in the us
[00:08] Brandon_R: the united states is the richest and most powerful country in the world
[00:08] Brandon_R: what's wrong with that?
[00:08] Dmitrijus: Brandon_R: the arrogance?
[00:09] cmr: Dmitrijus++

[00:09] Brandon_R: dmitrijus++
[00:09] catb0t: seriously , i can't ates against away
[00:09] catb0t: Dmitrijus now has 1 beer
[00:09] bingomanatee_: So you are saying the middle class in the US has a better lifestyle than the middle class of every other country? or that we have a fair number of people with a huge spike in income that drives the mean up. 
[00:09] nicholasf: so if anyone is in Oz I've created the nodejs.au google group
[00:10] Brandon_R: i'm not talking about classes etc
[00:10] Dmitrijus: bingomanatee_: for starters, i don't think we even have middle class separation here 
[00:10] bingomanatee_: Because there are a fair number of countries in Europe where the lifestyle of the middle class is quite better than it is in the US. 
[00:10] warz: it has been a few months since ive used nodejs and npm. i see that a simple 'npm install foo' does not appear to make that module available to a node app anywhere, anymore.
[00:10] Brandon_R: innovation and entrepreneurship is buzzing here 
[00:10] txdv: You know when they should how dentists went to africa and treated people for free? They do it in the US too now xD
[00:10] warz: has something changed?
[00:11] cmr: warz: are you looking for the -g switch of npm install:
[00:11] isaacs: warz: npm install foo <-- do this in your node program folder.
[00:11] cmr: ?
[00:11] bingomanatee_: then there
[00:11] isaacs: warz: then you can require() it
[00:11] bingomanatee_: 's that...
[00:11] Brandon_R: doctors without borders
[00:11] bingomanatee_: sorry - diverting. 
[00:11] isaacs: warz: npm faq <-- run this, and read it.
[00:11] isaacs: warz: use --global for command line apps.
[00:11] isaacs: warz: or local installs for require() things
[00:12] Brandon_R: i have a question
[00:12] Brandon_R: how is gcc compiled?
[00:12] cmr: './configure; make'
[00:13] Dmitrijus: Brandon_R: you mean, bootstrapping? :)
[00:13] Brandon_R: i mean how was the first version of gcc compiled?
[00:13] Brandon_R: like the src
[00:13] cmr: Brandon_R: you need a C compiler on the host system to start with.
[00:13] Brandon_R: there wasn't a gcc to compile it before
[00:13] Brandon_R: paradox
[00:13] cmr: The first ever C compiler was either in assembly or another language.
[00:13] cmr: It's called bootstrapping.
[00:13] warz: isaacs, alright, so it's suggested to install modules locally for each app?
[00:13] cmr: And the first assembler was probably written by hand.
[00:13] Brandon_R: punch cards

[00:21] isaacs: ggg: what kind of smart machine?
[00:21] isaacs: ggg: a no.de thing?
[00:22] isaacs: mc: write streams only emit "drain" if they've returned false from a write() call.
[00:22] txdv: sloccount says that node is 41$ mln worth (including the v8 engine, mostly the v8 engine)
[00:22] mc: i can confirm it's returning false from a write(), but it doesn't appear 'drain' is ever being emitted
[00:22] isaacs: mc: if every write could be flushed, no, there might never be a drain.
[00:22] isaacs: mc: well, then that's a bug :)

[00:43] isaacs: ggg: if you require() something, it's *your* dependency.  you must declare it.

[00:44] samBiotic has joined the channel
[00:44] MooGoo: sorry i had to

[00:44] ggg: if i require mongoose
[00:44] ggg: not mongodb
[00:45] isaacs: then put mongoose in your package.json
[00:45] ggg: even if I want to use global modules on my smart machine?
[00:45] ggg: i npm install'ed threw sshg
[00:45] isaacs: ggg: "use global modules" <-- what does that mean?
[00:46] isaacs: ggg: no.de machines will install with --link, so if something is already global, it'll pick up the global one.
[00:46] isaacs: if it's a match
[00:46] ggg: ok
[00:46] isaacs: so you'd have to ssh in and `npm install -g mongoose`
[00:46] ggg: because i have modules in node/lib/node_modules
[00:47] ggg: thats what i mean by global modules
[00:47] ggg: what would be the proper term?
[00:47] isaacs: ggg: yeah, tha'ts correct
[00:47] mc: ..oh
[00:47] mc: the write stream just doesn't emit drain until you stop putting stuff in it
[00:47] towski has joined the channel
[00:48] isaacs: mc: yeah
[00:48] mc: i was trying to block from writing to it until it's drained
[00:48] isaacs: mc: returning false from write() means "please stop writing until i drain. i'll let you know when it's ok again"
[00:48] mc: but apparently that's not working
[00:48] isaacs: mc: it'll buffer in memory if you don't respect it, though
[00:48] isaacs: but tha'ts just not ideal, is all
[00:49] mc: so i've got a function that writes a buffer
[00:49] mc: in the start of that function i check to see if it's already busy
[00:50] mc: set it to busy.. call .write()
[00:50] Brandon_R: hey guys
[00:50] mc: if .write() returns true then i go ahead and set my flag to not busy
[00:50] isaacs: hey, Brandon_R 
[00:50] Brandon_R: what do you think is the most important equation in physics?
[00:50] isaacs: mc: sure
[00:50] mc: otherwise it's in the 'drain' event
[00:50] mc: so the 'drain' event triggers and it sets the flag to not busy
[00:50] mc: allegedly
[00:50] mc: but it never triggers..
[00:50] isaacs: mc: you could just implement your thing as a stream, and then pipe to the target
[00:51] isaacs: mc: that's what i usually do
[00:51] mc: that's a thought.. write to my own in-memory stream and pipe it
[00:51] isaacs: mc: if it's busy, do you not write?
[00:51] mc: right
[00:51] isaacs: mc: or do you go ahead and write anyway?
[00:51] mc: if (busy) return;
[00:51] isaacs: also: does the tick end before you call it again?
[00:51] cmr: Brandon_R: why don't you stop asking off-topic questions
[00:51] mc: that, i do not know
[00:51] isaacs: ie, you're not like, while (haveStuffToWrite) writeIfNotBusy()
[00:52] mc: i'm using events
[00:52] isaacs: because that will just get you into a while true loop
[00:52] mc: basically i emit an event with some data
[00:52] Brandon_R: ok
[00:52] EyePulp has joined the channel
[00:52] Brandon_R: why are events better than threads?
[00:52] mc: when i get that event i queue that data to an array and emit the commit event
[00:52] isaacs: Brandon_R: you can ask off topic questions in here.
[00:52] stantona has joined the channel
[00:52] mc: the commit event is what's supposed to write, but only if i'm not busy
[00:52] isaacs: cmr may /ignore you, though
[00:52] isaacs: ;)
[00:52] mc: it does do a ton of emitting though
[00:53] isaacs: mc: it sounds like you're in the process of re-inventing backpressure ;)
[00:53] isaacs: mc: i'd recommend using a stream abstraction.  it's a good pattern.
[00:53] mc: yeah.. i'm definitely doing it wrong
[00:53] cmr: Brandon_R: threads and event loops aren't exclusive
[00:53] tomlion has joined the channel
[00:53] mc: i'm going to change my set event to write to an in memory stream
[00:53] JasonSmith: hey isaacs That reminds me, is it acceptable for streams to emit data events with non-string, non-Buffer content?
[00:53] mc: and pipe that stream to my file
[00:53] mc: i hadn't thought of that
[00:53] Brandon_R: is an event + callback just a mini thread if you really look at it
[00:54] cmr: Brandon_R: inefficient use of threads but it could be implemented like that. python's twisted has deferToThread, for example
[00:54] Dmitrijus: Brandon_R: events are better than threading, because generally task switching between processes are quite costly
[00:54] adrianF has joined the channel
[00:55] willwhite has joined the channel
[00:55] JasonSmith: I need backpressure in my Follow package so I want to make it a stream API but it emits objects, not strings

[00:56] Me1000 has joined the channel
[00:57] jimt_ has joined the channel
[00:57] cmr: Dmitrijus: you can have events and threads, just needs some management overhead
[00:57] isaacs: JasonSmith: i've done that a few times.
[00:57] isaacs: JasonSmith: node-tap works that way
[00:57] JasonSmith: huh
[00:57] isaacs: JasonSmith: the TapConsumer class takes string/buffer in, and emits data events with result objects.
[00:57] Dmitrijus: cmr: sure you can :) but generally it's quite messy if you do
[00:57] isaacs: JasonSmith: the TapProducer is the reverse.
[00:57] JasonSmith: Usually I'd ask mikeal about streams but he seems to have gotten a real job
[00:57] isaacs: JasonSmith: honestly?  it's kind of shitty.
[00:57] jmar777 has joined the channel
[00:57] cmr: Dmitrijus: for example one can spawn a thread to do an operation that needs to be async and have it notify the parent..

[00:58] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[00:58] JasonSmith: emitting objects as data is shitty?
[00:58] isaacs: JasonSmith: it'd be better to have a different event, other than "data", update .pipe() to handle that
[00:58] isaacs: JasonSmith: yeah
[00:58] isaacs: JasonSmith: wiht fstream, for example, I did a different thing
[00:58] isaacs: s
[00:58] JasonSmith: Well what I really want is .pause(), drain events, all that
[00:58] Dmitrijus: cmr: well, i do like purity :)

[00:59] isaacs: JasonSmith: right
[00:59] isaacs: yeah, reading it now
[00:59] isaacs: JasonSmith: hey, re: _update as _show
[01:00] isaacs: JasonSmith: so, are you suggesting that we can do the inbox db thing, and then just have the _update function expose the data, if needed?
[01:00] isaacs: JasonSmith: so, for example, I could hit /_users/_design/blah/_update/showme?user=jhs and then have it spit out everything abotu you except your password/hash if i'm not you?
[01:00] isaacs: JasonSmith: in an inbox-db world?
[01:02] JasonSmith: firstly, it's slightly more RESTful: /_users/_design/npmjs/_update/showme/jhs
[01:02] nicholasf has joined the channel
[01:02] JasonSmith: And I'm thinking, if(req.userCtx.name == doc.name) return [null, JSON.stringify(doc)]
[01:03] JasonSmith: right? That is, no change to the doc, and the response is basically exactly as if you had hit /_users/jhs

[01:16] Morgawr: guys, I have a question... I took someone's code (a starting structure for an express.js webserver) and there's this line in the app.configure(): app.set('secret', 'your secret'); 
[01:16] pancake: cmr: thanks
[01:16] Morgawr: and later on it does "app.use(express.cookieParser(app.settings.secret));"
[01:16] Morgawr: I know what .use(express.cookieParser()) does
[01:16] Morgawr: but what does that secret thing mean?
[01:17] Morgawr: is it some default pre-set cookie/environment variable or something?
[01:17] Morgawr: so I can store magic numbers and stuff in the application itself?
[01:17] Morgawr: (for password hashes for example... or stuff like that)
[01:18] CoverSlide: cookieparser doesn't take an argument
[01:18] CoverSlide: they are confusing it with express.session
[01:18] Morgawr: CoverSlide: apparently this does
[01:18] Morgawr: and it works
[01:19] Morgawr: https://github.com/stagas/yet-another-express-boilerplate/blob/master/app/server.js this is the code, someone from here gave it to me as a startup for an express.js application

[01:20] Morgawr: anyhow, could you please (or someone else) explain me the point of that? I have some difficulties understanding the differences between cookies and sessions...
[01:20] CoverSlide: connect.session uses the secret, not cookieParser
[01:20] neurodrone_ has joined the channel
[01:20] CoverSlide: a session is a collection of settings for a specific user
[01:21] CoverSlide: sessions are stored on the server
[01:21] CoverSlide: cookies are settings stored on a browser
[01:21] CoverSlide: in order for the server to know what session to use, it needs a cookie
[01:21] CoverSlide: which is why cookieparser comes before session
[01:21] CoverSlide: this is required
[01:21] mehlah has joined the channel
[01:22] Morgawr: ah I see.. so basically I can store somekind of "local variable" (or local data) inside a session to be permanent between HTTP request from the user (recognized through a cookie)?
[01:22] CoverSlide: yes
[01:22] Morgawr: http://senchalabs.github.com/connect/middleware-session.html I'm reading this now, apparently secret is calculated for hashes... well, that explains a bit
[01:22] Morgawr: so I take I can just add random values (if I need to store them) to be sure they remain accessible for subsequient requests
[01:22] Morgawr: (by the same user)
[01:23] CoverSlide: yeah
[01:23] Morgawr: ok, that helps a lot, thanks.. :)

[01:26] state_: When I console.log req.session I always get undefined.
[01:27] Morgawr: cmr: weirdly enough, I'm not a newbie with "web development" (the amateur way), I've done web courses in university (CS university) and I pretty much know how the HTTP protocol works and all that yadda yadda
[01:27] Morgawr: but I had never used sessions before 
[01:27] Morgawr: and I always thought sessions and cookies were pretty much the same thing
[01:28] cmr: Ah
[01:28] Morgawr: I worked at a project in ruby with sinatra and just used cookies without paying too much attention to "session", however express.js uses both so I was kind of curious

[01:42] CoverSlide: where are you console.log ing?
[01:43] state_: in an app.get 
[01:44] state_: it's so weird. it works in another app on the same machine
[01:44] warz: hmm. would anyone happen to know why my second express.js route is not accessible via browser? the root url is visible, but the '/soon' url responds with an "cannot get /soon" message.
[01:44] state_: implemented the same way
[01:44] warz: my code is here, and its was mostly generated by the express application itself, http://dpaste.com/679134/
[01:44] skm has joined the channel
[01:44] state_: warz: put the /soon route above the / route
[01:45] warz: state_, i tried that and it didn't appear to make a difference
[01:45] state_: warz: yeah, i realized that right after i said it
[01:46] mc: what in the hell.. seriously? is the documentation for fs.write wrong?
[01:46] warz: im running this behind nginx, so maybe that has something to do with it.
[01:46] mc: it says i should be able to add a callback
[01:46] mc: but the callback never triggers
[01:46] state_: warz: you're sure that the routes model you've got going is loading?
[01:46] state_: if you make those console.logs do they fire properly?
[01:47] state_: model = module, sorry
[01:47] DTrejo has joined the channel
[01:48] warz: hm, perhaps thats the problem. express just creates a directory called 'routes', with a single 'index.js' inside of it, which appears to be for a single route. so, i just created a second files called 'soon.js', with the other function in it.
[01:48] warz: i'd imagine it's not loading. i'll test.
[01:49] state_: warz: i'm not familiar with that. sounds like you might want to get a sense of the commonjs pattern for loading modules
[01:49] warz: yea, looks like it. it's not loading the other one. to the docs i go.
[01:50] warz: obviously i could put both route functions in the same file, but then all routes would have to go in there. its best i figure out the correct way of doing this, heh.
[01:52] chjj: mc: what is the problem?
[01:52] chjj: mc: you can have a callback for fs.write
[01:54] state_: warz: where you put the routes is up to you. sort of depends on the complexity of the application

[02:06] Morgawr: guys, how do I effectively delete a cookie with node.js? I know in ruby I used to just set it to null..but if I set it to "null" or "undefined" in express.js it just gives me the cookie as "null" instead of deleting it...
[02:06] JasonSmith: isaacs: I've got it! I will implement a ChangesStream which sticks to strings. All it will do is chop up the data so you are guaranteed well-formed JSON expressions (and support backpressure)
[02:06] cmr: Morgawr: note that express != node
[02:07] Morgawr: cmr: I figured it would be pretty much the same if I asked in here..
[02:07] aioue has joined the channel
[02:08] cmr: Morgawr: oh sure, but you aren't deleting a cookie with node's http, you want to do it with express, right?
[02:08] Morgawr: cmr: I guess so
[02:08] cmr: Morgawr: you are looking for res.clearCookie
[02:09] Morgawr: cmr: thanks! I guess I should lurk more around...

[03:49] isaacs: (most of it)
[03:49] sh1mmer: let me run my benchmarks again
[03:49] sh1mmer: hm
[03:49] sh1mmer: how much overhead is indexOf?
[03:49] isaacs: according to the profiling, most of it
[03:49] isaacs: i do a lot of checking whether a given char is in a specific set of chars
[03:49] sh1mmer: ah
[03:49] isaacs: and was doing that by having a big string, and checking if class.indexOf(char) === -1
[03:50] isaacs: i changed it to build up the classes and then do class = class.split("").reduce(function (set, c) { set[c] = true; return set }, {}) so that now i can just test class[char] rather than using indexOf
[03:50] sh1mmer: updates on npm?

[03:57] isaacs: if you're running a test from start to finish over and over again, then it won't improve.  but if yor'e doing enough parsing to make startup negligible, then it should be an improvement.
[03:57] isaacs: the startup time will be a little bit longer now
[03:57] sh1mmer: I read seconds as req/sec
[03:57] sh1mmer: because I'm silly
[03:57] isaacs: ah
[03:57] isaacs: so it got 50% slower?

[06:06] rohitcolinrao: sup dudes, happy friday
[06:07] Shaunzie: O.o wtf… how is it friday already ._.
[06:07] rohitcolinrao: so i implemented a connection via socket.io/node/express today, and successfully sent some messages back n forth from the client to server and vice versa… 
[06:07] rohitcolinrao: however
[06:07] pquerna: friday, friday, friday
[06:07] rohitcolinrao: i'm not finding much on security for working with sockets
[06:07] Shaunzie: rohitcolinrao: security?
[06:07] rohitcolinrao: i.e. anyone know how i would validate a client on the server?
[06:08] Shaunzie: rohitcolinrao: what do you mean by "validate"?
[06:08] sh1mmer: pquerna: do you know when the destructor on an object wrapped with ObjectWrap is called? When it's out of scope?
[06:08] rohitcolinrao: also, how i would protect my server against potential security vulnerabilities.. for example, whats to stop someone from creating a client and connecting to my server socket directly?
[06:09] rohitcolinrao: sorry by validate i mean authenticate
[06:09] pquerna: sh1mmer: when v8 decides to GC it
[06:09] sh1mmer: pquerna: right, but when it's out of scope?
[06:09] vnguyen has joined the channel
[06:09] pquerna: well
[06:09] pquerna: it depends on the gc
[06:09] pquerna: but in concept, yes
[06:09] cmr: rohitcolinrao: you need to implement your own protocol, or find a library that does it for you.
[06:09] sh1mmer: Is there a penalty in releasing managed memory early?
[06:10] pquerna: there have been various issues in the past with these type ofobjects getting into the old gen or such when they shouldn't so it wouldn't always aggressively GC them
[06:10] sh1mmer: I'm working on the expat binding
[06:10] rohitcolinrao: ah i see
[06:10] sh1mmer: and it seems like I can destroy the expat parser when end() is caled
[06:10] pquerna: yes
[06:10] pquerna: its probally fine to do that
[06:10] pquerna: destroy it, set it null
[06:10] pquerna: if ~ is called
[06:10] pquerna: and not null, also kill it
[06:11] sh1mmer: that's a good call
[06:13] sh1mmer: rohitcolinrao: are you using any frameworks
[06:13] fangel has joined the channel
[06:13] sh1mmer: rohitcolinrao: express for example has a number of plugins to do various kinds of authentication
[06:14] rohitcolinrao: ok, that being said, anyone have any idea on what a design for implementing socket security would be?  for example:  if i open a socket.io connection via client script, what's a good way to protect against malicious clients?  tokens could be readable by anyone so can't send a token or something from the client/browser?  set a session on the server and connect it to the logged on client?  i'm still trying to wrap my head around it
[06:14] rohitcolinrao: yes i'm using express for now
[06:14] level09 has joined the channel
[06:14] rohitcolinrao: but i'm not looking to do standard authentication from a browser to the server
[06:14] Shaunzie: rohitcolinrao: SSL?
[06:15] sh1mmer: SSL seems like an obvious start
[06:15] rohitcolinrao: i'm looking to make sure my socket.io connection has some type of auth
[06:15] sh1mmer: along with some kind of authentication token on the page
[06:15] rohitcolinrao: yes i thought about ssl and yes i think it's a start
[06:15] rohitcolinrao: that's encryption tho
[06:15] rohitcolinrao: right, 
[06:15] rohitcolinrao: ok
[06:16] rohitcolinrao: ok, so an encrypted auth token of some sort is what you're suggesting
[06:16] rohitcolinrao: a client-side token that autos against the server on connection of the socket
[06:16] rohitcolinrao: autos = auths
[06:17] sh1mmer: yep
[06:17] sh1mmer: print something in the web page when it loads
[06:17] fomatin has left the channel
[06:18] sh1mmer: and then have the javascript use that to start the socket session
[06:18] rohitcolinrao: yeah, i'm trying to think of if there would be a way to xss something like that
[06:18] jhurliman has joined the channel
[06:18] rohitcolinrao: even through ssl
[06:18] sh1mmer: you can't XSS it unless there is already an XSS on the site
[06:19] sh1mmer: XSS often involves tricking a browser into making a request in which cookies authenticate
[06:19] sh1mmer: which is why another factor is important
[06:19] rohitcolinrao: not necessarily
[06:19] rohitcolinrao: i mean
[06:19] sh1mmer: because cookies are sent automagically
[06:19] wedtm has joined the channel
[06:19] rohitcolinrao: if a hacker gets access to my auth token, they can successfully authenticate to my socket server
[06:20] rohitcolinrao: they don't need a cookie
[06:20] sh1mmer: these are one time tokens
[06:20] sh1mmer: per user
[06:20] sh1mmer: or rather per page hit
[06:20] rohitcolinrao: ok
[06:20] rohitcolinrao: how could they be validated then?
[06:20] rohitcolinrao: as authentic
[06:20] sh1mmer: how do you authenticate your uses normally?
[06:21] rohitcolinrao: well i don't have to deal with an open socket normally… usually it's a standard user/pass type thing
[06:21] sh1mmer: and then you set a session token
[06:21] rohitcolinrao: sure 
[06:21] sh1mmer: so hash and salt or hmac or whatever the session token with a timestamp
[06:21] sh1mmer: send the timestamp and the hash
[06:21] rohitcolinrao: right
[06:21] sh1mmer: and the you can validate it on the server by looking in the cookie jar and recomputing
[06:21] rohitcolinrao: ok… alright

[06:22] sh1mmer: this is really very standard

[06:22] sh1mmer: that kind of stuff
[06:22] rohitcolinrao: yeah
[06:22] sh1mmer: ACTION used to work for Yahoo
[06:23] rohitcolinrao: well… the issue tho is when that happens normally, the data isn't sent or placed in client script (like the connection information for my socket)
[06:23] rohitcolinrao: it's generally a post
[06:23] rohitcolinrao: couple of course with ssl
[06:23] sh1mmer: doesn't matter
[06:23] sh1mmer: you just need to print the information in the page that's going to post
[06:23] sh1mmer: or drop it in a stand-alone script
[06:23] rohitcolinrao: yeah i can dig i
[06:23] rohitcolinrao: it
[06:24] sh1mmer: like <script type="text/javascript">var token='foo';var timestamp='1234567890'</script>
[06:24] sh1mmer: and now I'm going back to my C++
[06:24] sh1mmer: enjoy :)
[06:24] rohitcolinrao: ok so that's really where my issue exists
[06:25] rohitcolinrao: that's client side script
[06:25] willwhite has joined the channel
[06:25] rohitcolinrao: ssl doesn't encrypt that unless you're on port 443
[06:25] rohitcolinrao: what's to stop anyone from just viewing it and getting the token?
[06:25] nicholasf has joined the channel
[06:27] sh1mmer: ugh
[06:27] sh1mmer: they can get their own token
[06:27] sh1mmer: but unless you have some other XSS bug on your pages
[06:27] sh1mmer: the contents of the page is inaccessible
[06:27] rohitcolinrao: no man
[06:27] rohitcolinrao: if they get the token they can get the content
[06:28] sh1mmer: *sigh*
[06:28] sh1mmer: look, sorry
[06:28] sh1mmer: if someone authenticates
[06:28] sh1mmer: with user/pass
[06:28] sh1mmer: only they can view those pages correct?
[06:28] sh1mmer: then if you print a token on those pages it's secure
[06:29] sh1mmer: because you don't have any other XSS bugs that would allow an attack vector to steal it
[06:29] sh1mmer: and then use it to break the socket connection
[06:29] rohitcolinrao: well yes, but that will work ONLY for user authentication sessions
[06:29] sh1mmer: no
[06:29] rohitcolinrao: that means that i can't open a socket unless a user actually sends a user/pass
[06:29] sh1mmer: that was just an example
[06:30] sh1mmer: if you don't have an XSS bug on your site in general this technique works fine

[06:37] tseNkiN has left the channel
[06:40] rohitcolinrao: ok, thought it through a bit more and the issue is still there:  here is why:  1.  even with ssl, all client side code is readable by anyone.  2.  a socket connection is opened via client side code.  3.  we can't send the server sensitive auth information because it would be stored in client side code, readable by anyone, and thus making the entire connection vulnerable.  where is the disconnect here?

[08:54] Shaunzie: devices i sundefined
[08:54] eliasp: Shaunzie: sure, but why? isn't it exported together with PulseAudio?
[08:54] duffman has joined the channel

[08:56] Shaunzie: a.devices()
[08:57] igl: try http://pastie.org/3094856
[08:58] Shaunzie: igl: same problem. needs to create a new PulseAudio object in order to access the devices function
[08:58] eliasp: igl: doesn't work...
[08:58] igl: ah he uses proto
[08:58] igl: ^^
[08:58] Shaunzie: yesir :3
[08:58] eliasp: Shaunzie: hmm, you mean my problem lies within my testnode.js ... hmm
[08:59] Shaunzie: eliasp: yes. instantiate PulseAudio ad then you can call the devices function

[09:02] eliasp: ah, right ;)
[09:02] Shaunzie: eliasp: you also don't need the .js extension :3
[09:02] eliasp: ok
[09:03] cmr: I must say, I prefer the prototype way though it does take some getting used to.
[09:03] Shaunzie: new require('./pulseaudio')
[09:04] igl: or Obj.creat and remove the new again http://pastie.org/3094877

[09:07] igl: well keep in mind object create uses defined properties
[09:07] igl: see: value:"", enumberable:true
[09:08] eliasp: I see... instead of this.foobar but what (dis)advantages does this have?
[09:08] eliasp: these properties are still accessible from within the module methods, right?
[09:09] igl: yes but now you can choose if they are
[09:09] martndemus has joined the channel
[09:09] eliasp: igl: ah, great... something I was looking for previously
[09:09] igl: enumerable: True if and only if this property shows up during enumeration of the properties on the corresponding object. Defaults to false.
[09:10] igl: false, and it wont come up in a for in

[09:46] Shaunzie: richardr: mm the structure out of the box is pretty much solid. It's lightweight, so it allows for as much flexibility as needed.

[09:47] Shaunzie: many of the examples are pretty usefull

[14:35] AAA_awright: ranza_: You're not doing anything with the data
[14:36] AAA_awright: ranza_: You should also be using 'end'
[14:37] ranza_: AAA_awright: no the musicmetadata module takes a stream as input

[14:37] cognominal___ has joined the channel
[14:37] AAA_awright: You're going to end up calling it several times for each data event, with the same stream
[14:39] AAA_awright: If it really takes a stream as an argument then you should be calling parse(reader) right after you create the reader stream
[14:39] ranza_: AAA_awright: because i want to ensure that i have data before passing the file?
[14:39] Salam has joined the channel

[14:43] ranza_: AAA_awright: now im parsing the stream directly and only hooking in on the error

[16:55] Morgawr: hello everybody, I have a very simple/stupid question.. I'm using express.js (it's a general javascript/node.js question though) and I have a lot of lines of code just for routing management (stuff like app.get('/whatever'), etc etc) and I want all that code to go into another file (separated form my app.configure or app.use parts) just to have it more tidy and easier to read
[16:55] Morgawr: how would I do that? I was thinking of doing somekind of "include" but apparently it doesn't work like this in javascript...
[16:55] luke` has joined the channel
[16:56] Morgawr: what's the suggested way of doing it?
[16:57] AndreasM_: Hey there is a module allowing one to run a server function from a client browser in javascript, what is it called?
[16:57] mattgifford has joined the channel
[16:57] tbranyen: AndreasM_: nowjs?
[16:58] tbranyen: AndreasM_: seen a few modules that do that
[16:58] Morgawr: nobody can help me? :(
[16:59] AndreasM_: Properly ryan told me yesterday that the next generation cluster modules should do something like [missingLetter]node, it was totally clear but now well it gone :)
[16:59] tbranyen: Morgawr: make a new express server in each file and require that into an app.use("/prefix", require("./subroutes"))
[16:59] TooTallNate has joined the channel
[17:00] Morgawr: tbranyen: so basically you're telling me I have to make another server just to handle the routing?
[17:00] tbranyen: its an object
[17:01] tbranyen: and don't bind to a port
[17:01] tbranyen: i dunno why that sounds so outlandish
[17:01] Morgawr: ok.. let's backpedal a second.. I just need a way to call functions from another file in javascript, how do I achieve that? (I know it's a very basic question.. but I tried looking around and didn't find anything)
[17:01] deeprogram has joined the channel
[17:01] tbranyen: might be a better way, but thats how i've done it
[17:01] tbranyen: attach them to the exports object
[17:01] NothingMan65 has joined the channel
[17:01] __doc__ has joined the channel
[17:01] tbranyen: require that file
[17:01] tbranyen: and call them
[17:01] Morgawr: ah ok
[17:02] tbranyen: exports.something = function() { }; require("./some-module").something()
[17:02] Morgawr: but I need to add those functions to exports, right?
[17:02] Morgawr: ok perfect
[17:02] Morgawr: I will do that instead I guess
[17:02] Morgawr: makes more sense
[17:02] tbranyen: sounds messier and harder to maintain tho
[17:02] Morgawr: why?
[17:02] jlank:  app.use(app.router);
[17:02] tbranyen: because you're editting one file then need to change another 
[17:02] tbranyen: instead of working in just one
[17:02] Morgawr: all I have is a bunch of routing in file#1 and file#2..file#N handles each the specific case for the routing
[17:02] Morgawr: so I can just do
[17:02] jlank: then in routes/index.js put your functions
[17:02] gavin_huang has joined the channel
[17:02] Morgawr: app.get('/login',login.handler);
[17:03] MrMaksimize has joined the channel
[17:03] Morgawr: login = require('./file_login');
[17:03] Morgawr: someting like that
[17:03] Morgawr: it sounds much more cleaner and easier to read imo
[17:03] Morgawr: rather than having thousands of line in one single file
[17:03] Morgawr: every file has its specific functions and code
[17:03] tbranyen: wat
[17:03] tbranyen: when did i say to do that
[17:04] davetayls has joined the channel
[17:04] jlank: in your routes/index.js just include the files you need on a per export basis

Like a function I want to be able to call in both files? do I just make a third file and require that file into both of them? (is that

[18:02] tuhoojabotti: yeah
[18:02] tuhoojabotti: or something like that
[18:02] HardP: yea

[18:20] pendlepants: hey all, is there some standard best practice for deploying node apps behind a load balancer? everything I've seen online (express, etc) has hard-coded port numbers but that doesn't seem particularly scaleable.
[18:23] Shaunzie: pendlepants: from what I've seen, most people run node on a high port then stick nginx or some other proxy in front of it, and proxy off of port 80
[18:23] aliem has joined the channel
[18:23] HardP: if I export like this: module.exports = new Something
[18:24] HardP: does it mean every time I include the module a new instance will be created?

[18:33] zomg: Mongodb speicfically, any good libs for this or do you just write a bunch of updates in the shell? =)
[18:33] brl0: i'm munging my first scripts, and I'm curious how to set a value in my server.js that can be used in the require('files.js') before they're executed 
[18:33] zomg: and hope for the best..
[18:33] zomg: =)
[18:33] zomg: brl0: I'm not sure if I follow? You want the code in files.js use some value in server.js, but you're requiring files.js in server.js and not the other way around?
[18:34] brl0: basically, there is one file that does something like require('events.js') and events.js has inline Events.client = redis.createClient().. and I would like to pass parameters to that redis.createClient
[18:34] zomg: You probably should move it into a function and call that with the parameters you want passed along
[18:35] brl0: i have the parameters as argv.redishost argv.redisport when starting node..
[18:35] zomg: Generally it's recommended that just requiring a module does not have any side effects like that
[18:35] simpleton: Hi guys, new to the land of node.js - when I try to run app.js I get this https://gist.github.com/1540943 I don't understand it. The stack trace, unlike Ruby's, doesn't show anything specific
[18:36] brl0: ok, I did move it into a function, but I'm worried I'm polluting the modules design by chaining initClient() calls and passing the args
[18:36] zomg: brl0: well you could make it export something like Events.init or whatever, then just call Events.init(argv.redishost, argv.redisport)
[18:36] brl0: it works
[18:36] simpleton: or is that stack trace telling me that the app can't connect to mongo server?
[18:36] metalball2 has joined the channel
[18:37] zomg: simpleton: undefined is not a function generally means that you're trying to call undefined
[18:37] zomg: as in, you have something like hello(); in your code, where 'hello' is undefined
[18:37] simpleton: zomg call as in database call?
[18:38] simpleton: can I gist contents of app.js? It's 50 simple lines...
[18:38] zomg: It does look like the error is coming from the mongodb library so I'm not quite sure why it would do that

[18:40] ajpiano: ACTION must be missing something obvious
[18:40] zomg: simpleton: it does, the line where it's caused is mongodb/db.js 173
[18:41] simpleton: zomg indeed, but I mean doesn't specify which line of the 50 of app.js are calling that undefined function
[18:41] zomg: Ah
[18:41] zomg: Most likely it's because it was caused by some event
[18:41] simpleton: did you see anything wrong with the gist?
[18:41] zomg: Thus it would not be an immediate result of your app.js code
[18:41] zomg: Nope, that looked okay as far as I can tell
[18:41] zomg: Try commenting out everything else in app.js except the part which connects to the database

[18:46] zomg: ajpiano: Well the fact node isn't working from cmd would indicate that to me.
[18:47] zomg: ajpiano: considering the msi most likely changed some system-wide environmental variables (namely PATH), for which to take effect tends to require a reboot
[18:47] tuhoojabotti: jaequery: http get, parse, find links?
[18:47] ajpiano: yeah, but i restatrted cmd.exe a few times --- i'm restarting now anyway

[18:47] benvie: type "env" into run

[21:20] AndreasMadsen: Fine, thanks
[21:21] jacobrask: I'm looking for a good way to easily share views/templates between Node.js and the browser. I want to initially render a list with a bunch of items, but then render the list items again through the same template
[21:21] marcello3d: quiet morning
[21:21] marcello3d: jacobrask: I think there's a browser version of jade
[21:21] jacobrask: I've gotten closest so far with CoffeeKup
[21:22] AndreasMadsen: Use jade to pre compile a parser
[21:22] jacobrask: there seems to be some way with Jade yes, I was just thinking.. isn't _everyone_ hitting this problem?
[21:22] marcello3d: currently I'm generating everything server-side, so, no
[21:22] Shaunzie: what he said ^
[21:23] marcello3d: for the ajaxy stuff the dom is so simple I just generate it in dom-land
[21:23] AndreasMadsen: I'm in the progress of writing an isomofic webframework, but it is hard work.
[21:23] marcello3d: or I just send down html fragments
[21:24] jacobrask: I'm using socket.io, doesn't feel right to send html with that even though I could
[21:24] marcello3d: why not?
[21:24] `3rdEden: as long you don't send any XSS, you will be fine
[21:24] marcello3d: if you have a lot of html, sure, do client-side templating
[21:25] marcello3d: (or rethink your css)
[21:25] jacobrask: AndreasMadsen: Zappa has done some work on that, but not with views yet
[21:25] marcello3d: at the end of the day a template is just function(datastruct) -> string
[21:26] AndreasMadsen: Link?
[21:26] jacobrask: http://zappajs.org/
[21:27] briancra_ has joined the channel
[21:27] jacobrask: you do client 'index': -> (client side code here) and it automatically serves the files, if you define something with helper 'foo': ->  it's accessible in both server and client
[21:27] mattgifford has joined the channel
[21:27] jacobrask: I don't link the weird DSL:ish stuff though, too different from vanilla express/node.js when it comes to open source projects I want participants on
[21:27] marcello3d: what does @ mean?
[21:27] marcello3d: in cs?
[21:27] jacobrask: 'this'
[21:27] CoverSlide: @ means this.
[21:28] marcello3d: how about require('zappa') ->
[21:28] level09 has joined the channel
[21:28] AndreasMadsen: Zappa dose not seams like isomofic just output streaming.
[21:29] jacobrask: I was thinking of this: http://zappajs.org/docs/0.3-gumbo/reference/#shared  but maybe I've got the terminology wrong

[21:31] eignerchris has joined the channel
[21:32] vol4ok has joined the channel
[21:32] jacobrask: yeah. I did a test with Zappa and I really liked the work flow of being in one file and just doing on/emit in client/server code that looked basically the same, like they were in the same environment. Doesn't have to be in the same file, but just to make it feel integrated is really nice when developing
[21:32] AndreasMadsen: My goal is to pull ressource from server to client, and fallback on server if javascript is not active or a old browser is used.
[21:32] jacobrask: ok
[21:32] marcello3d: andreas: pjax? :D
[21:33] CoverSlide: the problem is how do you detect lack of javascript on the client if the client is not scriptable?
[21:33] jacobrask: One approach could be to just do all rendering client side, but on the first request and if javascript is not available render it on the server side with jsdom?
[21:33] marcello3d: CoverSlide: assuming the majority of your users wouldn't be in that situation you could use a splash page + cookie to figure it out
[21:34] AndreasMadsen: CoverSlide: I have solved that withou cookies

[22:27] mmalecki: but it's retarded
[22:27] wankdanker: fwg: thanks; i will probably end up doing that. Do you know if date.getTimezoneOffset() is daylight savings time aware?
[22:27] jredville: I wrap in anon function's for the sake of closure, never just for "use strict"
[22:28] fwg: wankdanker㇀ yes it is
[22:29] wankdanker: fwg: this is just for date comparison. i have a promotion that ends at end of day on 12/31/2011 (eastern time). is there a better way to do this?
[22:31] fwg: ah, alright. it would only be a problem if you had an api that returned that value or if the user would come in contact with it
[22:32] fwg: but you could always compute the UTC timestamp of the eastern time first, and then use that for comparison

I just hate when I can't wrap my head around the basics like this.

[23:08] marcello3d: loucal: you'd have to do building up yourself

[23:12] loucal: maxogden: ok, checking that out
[23:12] marcello3d: loucal: (I didn't see your gist till now) it is building it up, but it happens asynchronously, so it's built up after your call to console.log('itunesJson:' + itunesJson);
[23:12] marcello3d: so you're making a string "", logging it, then adding stuff to it
[23:13] loucal: ahhh, marcello3d thank you, I kind of figured that, but wasn't getting it because i was logging it first
[23:14] jredville has joined the channel
[23:14] loucal: so before I check out request, is there any simple way I could just wait to insert into mongo?  If you see the commented out lines give me an error because JSON.parse() doesn't seem to be getting a whole object

[23:25] hughfdjackson: is worlize's websocket implementation 'the one'?
[23:25] benvie: latest canary has it in about:flags at the bottom
[23:25] hughfdjackson: as in the defacto implementation
[23:26] benvie: yeah I see Set, Map, WeakMap, Proxy, let and const work
[23:26] iRoj has joined the channel
[23:27] benvie: well let only works in strict mode functions

[23:28] benvie: http://erik.eae.net/ has been writing this week about it
[23:28] richardr: Are there any very new, modern open-source examples of Node.js in action? (activity within last week) ... e.g. cms, blogs, etc that have *good* application structures
[23:28] chunhao_ has joined the channel
[23:28] benvie: hah, typeof null === 'null'
[23:29] benvie: wonder how much stuff that'll break
[23:29] redir_ has joined the channel
[23:30] vol4ok has joined the channel
[23:30] xSmurf: benvie: why would it break? that's standard JS
[23:31] benvie: typeof null === 'object' up to ES6
[23:31] hughfdjackson: <3 oh js
[23:31] benvie: lol
[23:31] hughfdjackson: you fickle beast you
[23:31] vicapow has joined the channel
[23:32] benvie: Proxy is fun to use in browsers, proxying DOM elements is fun
[23:32] benvie: kind of breaks things
[23:32] xSmurf: benvie: ah right
[23:34] richardr: Anyone using RailwayJS?
[23:34] chjj: typeof null === 'null' isnt as harmful as you think
[23:34] ph^_ has joined the channel
[23:34] martin_sunset has joined the channel
[23:35] chjj: a lot of people test for null just by doing `a === null`, not `typeof a === 'object' && !a`
[23:35] Cromulent has joined the channel
[23:36] benvie: no you're right
[23:36] benvie: I was thinking more of the
[23:36] benvie: switch (typeof x) situation
[23:37] benvie: although i guess that's fine still anyway
[23:37] benvie: since it explicitly tests for null at the end

[23:38] tiglionabbit has joined the channel
[23:38] alcuadrado: I'm having trouble with Ejs and undefined variables
[23:38] alcuadrado: I have a template which may have or not a variable defined
[23:39] zomg: I think it might be best to just define then as null or undefined in the object you pass to ejs
[23:39] DTrejo: what was that client side ajax api library that isaac was praising the other day on twitter?
[23:39] zomg: but if for whatever reason you can't do that, using if(typeof whatever == 'undefined') should work
[23:39] LeMike has joined the channel
[23:40] alcuadrado: yep, I think I'm gonna do the former one
[23:40] alcuadrado: it's the correct way in js
