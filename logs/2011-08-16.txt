[02:12] ecin has joined the channel
[02:13] Zebra12_: bradleymeck: that looks like what i want. the idea is that in the future I will be changing these app to return JSON instead of html like they are doing now, and then slowly rewrite the tempting layer in node
[02:14] Zebra12_: that makes sense right?

[09:30] hekkwan: Hi all, Im building a SMS gateway on Node, and one of the requirements is to create filters that detect abuse of the service before processing inbound SMS. I have built a object that represents the message, and I want to chain functions together that get called on the object before it gets processed. The trick is that the Sequalize node module uses callbacks (obviously) for non-blocking IO, so I think there wont be a way to control the flow
[09:30] hekkwan:  of the chain. Is my idea just not the right way to approach this kind of problem in Node?

I'm running into an issue where I have a method which gives out auto-incrementing ID's but I'm finding that I'm getting giving duplicate ID's if I ask for a few at once. I sort of understand why it is happening but not sure what to do about it.

[10:05] japj: I think currently there is a 1Gb max v8 limit

[10:20] Abacab: async socket handling ? 
[10:20] zilch has joined the channel
[10:20] Abacab: I am missing something probable.
[10:20] Abacab: probably.
[10:21] blueadept: it's actually not a bad function language
[10:21] Abacab: SURE is a lot of interesting.
[10:21] Abacab: er, interest in it.
[10:21] blueadept: closures
[10:21] Abacab: how is it used, and where ?

[10:23] Abacab: just trying to get my arms around what it's about
[10:23] Abacab: or why it's so attractive- and it seems to be
[10:23] blueadept: it's just a programming language
[10:23] Abacab: something about async io
[10:23] blueadept: i would try to make something 
[10:23] Abacab: oh, it's a language ok - 
[10:23] Abacab: I thought it was a javascript library
[10:23] Abacab: for async io
[10:23] blakmatrix has joined the channel
[10:23] jetienne: Abacab: code it for a day, this will give you a better answer
[10:23] Abacab: for js
[10:24] Abacab: primarily wbe based.
[10:24] iivvoo: it's like twisted for javascript, sorta, am I right?
[10:24] framlin: Abacab: if you want to use the same prog-language for web-client and web-server .... -> NODEJS
[10:24] iivvoo: if that means anything to you
[10:24] blueadept: well
[10:24] zilch has joined the channel
[10:24] garrensmith: sebastianedwards: no idea it should just work. How are you running that code
[10:24] blueadept: ok, it's javascript
[10:24] blueadept: thats the language
[10:24] blueadept: but it's server side
[10:24] Abacab: well still though
[10:24] Abacab: what does it do in a real world server scenario ? 
[10:24] jetienne: no real world
[10:24] framlin: Abacab: Jav
[10:24] Abacab: and again - ALL respect- just asking... to understand better.
[10:24] iivvoo: right, and that's special - you can do js on client and server
[10:25] framlin: JavaScript ... for both
[10:25] blueadept: you can make a lighweight servers very easily
[10:25] garrensmith: Abacab: probably best to try it and then see
[10:25] jetienne: Abacab: real world is php
[10:25] Abacab: I'm not getting an answer yet - but that's okay
[10:25] Abacab: real world is NOT php
[10:25] Abacab: I will not- and do not use php
[10:25] jetienne: Abacab: go out and check
[10:25] Abacab: I want freedom FROM php
[10:25] Abacab: php to me is a hack
[10:25] jetienne: Abacab: or better go code something
[10:25] iivvoo: javascript is a hack :)
[10:25] jetienne: iivvoo: this is true :) http://wtfjs.org
[10:26] Abacab: but - is node.js something that I could use OTHER than php ? or say- asp ? or asp.net ?
[10:26] framlin: Abacab: If you highliy distributed system with diffrent kinds of "server" tcp, socket, http, telnet ....  -> nodejs
[10:26] Abacab: or some cgi solution ? PERL based etc? 
[10:26] jetienne: Abacab: not really
[10:26] Abacab: framlin - you are closest perhaps - that's kind of what I thought.
[10:26] blueadept: Abacab: http://www.quora.com/Node-js/What-companies-are-using-Node-js-in-production
[10:26] Abacab: was just looking to nail what it is and what it isn't
[10:26] framlin: Abacab: nodejs is optimized fpr networking
[10:26] Abacab: thank you blue
[10:26] blueadept: thats a decent list of some companies using node exclusively

[10:27] mike5w3c has joined the channel

[10:27] Abacab: I WOULD love a real world example though
[10:27] Abacab: of when someone would say- ah- node.js is what we want OVER X, Y or Z
[10:27] jetienne: Abacab: what is the real world you keep talking about 
[10:27] framlin: http may be called a "first class prototcoll" for nodejs, but netrworking in general and passing/piping data from net-node to net-node ist THE node-feature .... if you like JavaScript ... ;)
[10:27] Abacab: jet- lol
[10:28] jetienne: Abacab: i was serious
[10:28] blueadept: Abacab: here's a cool realtime aution dashboard written all in node: http://labs.metamx.com/
[10:28] Abacab: no lol Jet- I mean production environment
[10:28] Abacab: if you didn't make that jump
[10:28] blueadept: i'm working on something like this
[10:28] Abacab: least I didn't say unreal world
[10:28] Abacab: but I suppose I didn imply - and introduce a polarity
[10:28] arpunk has joined the channel
[10:28] jetienne: Abacab: node == super hard to find good dev + bad doc + very few libraries
[10:28] blueadept: anyone here using postgres for node, i have a question about inserting huge statements for schema creation
[10:29] framlin: Abacab: and with node comes a "new paradigm" non-blocking-async-evet-driven-architcture
[10:29] Abacab: I mean, you EXPLICITLY say 'real world' you IMPLY - some unreal world exists.
[10:29] jetienne: Abacab: my advice is dont use it :)
[10:29] jetienne: much easier to find dev in ruby/php than javascript. 
[10:29] blueadept: well here's the thing, with other languages, it's hard to find libs that are written in a non-blocking fashion
[10:29] Abacab: framlin - I DO get the event driven aspect - inherited from js
[10:29] Abacab: thanks for sharing that insight though
[10:29] jetienne: so not production ready
[10:29] blueadept: with node, everything is non-blocking
[10:29] zilch has joined the channel
[10:30] jetienne has left the channel
[10:30] Abacab: so, node is heavily connected to 'non blocking' 
[10:30] blueadept: well yeah
[10:30] Abacab: I DID see Ryan's google tech talk
[10:30] bicranial has joined the channel
[10:30] Abacab: was neat to see someone use the term 'asshole' in a public conference.
[10:30] framlin: Abacab: yes, so you know it from the browser - or maybe, from other systems like Delphi was in earlier days;
[10:30] blueadept: you dont have to wait for operations to finish to go on to the next piece of code
[10:30] Abacab: but it worked- all geek in Ryal aside.
[10:30] blueadept: which is create for lots of highly concurrent connections and such
[10:30] blueadept: create*great
[10:31] framlin: Abacab: but with node, you may take this architecture/pardigm and move it to the server
[10:31] Abacab: so's0rs- asynch is a critical piece of node. ok
[10:31] Abacab: real world - er, production environment
[10:31] Abacab: when might I use that ? 
[10:31] Abacab: simple page requests ? 
[10:31] blueadept: its the style of how you write the code
[10:31] Abacab: SOUNDS like node can help me skip php
[10:31] Abacab: and go server side js
[10:31] framlin: you may build a system of nodes, that solve problems in a distributed way and communicate over tcp/ip to "syncronize" their async tasks vie events
[10:31] blueadept: its the nature of a functional language like javascript
[10:32] Abacab: framlin - thanks
[10:32] Abacab: that helped
[10:32] blueadept: yeah it's event driven programming
[10:32] Abacab: so, it's event oriented programming
[10:32] Abacab: er, oh - blueadept already said that
[10:32] Abacab: ok
[10:32] Abacab: but the focus is server side
[10:32] Abacab: now, what about node.js on client side ? 
[10:32] zilch has joined the channel
[10:32] Abacab: or is not much making sense ?
[10:33] Abacab:  when I see .js I think - package or library - is node 'just' that ? a library ? 
[10:33] Abacab: sounds like in essence- it's some async wrapper
[10:33] Abacab: but for what types of i/o ? 
[10:33] framlin: event-driven object-functional oriented programming ...
[10:33] blueadept: ^
[10:33] Abacab: or does node is essence provide some framework for event handling ? 
[10:33] Abacab: to make it easier
[10:34] framlin: nodejs on the client would be like using chrome without any sandbox ;)
[10:34] Abacab: kind like - say JQuery does for GUI 
[10:34] blueadept: yeah people write npm's, or node libs, that deal with specific types of events you want to do
[10:34] blueadept: like express helps with http requesting
[10:34] Abacab: I have to digest that one framlin - it will stick with me for weeks
[10:34] Abacab: well thank you
[10:34] Abacab: for insights - I'm closer

[10:34] Abacab: here
[10:35] blueadept: Abacab: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules
[10:35] Abacab: I'd say framlin and blue put it well
[10:35] blueadept: that list of modules contains all the popular libs that people use in conjuction with node
[10:35] zilch has joined the channel
[10:35] dfsfdf: i'd like to see a browser written in js :)
[10:36] SubStack: more comprehensive node modules list: http://search.npmjs.org
[10:36] blueadept: ^ that too
[10:36] Abacab: blue- that's the answer
[10:36] Abacab: thanks
[10:36] Abacab: I'm scouring that page- 
[10:36] Abacab: under SMTP - I see 'full server' etc - ok ok 
[10:36] Abacab: that link shows enough real world uses
[10:37] blueadept: there just like ruby gems more or less
[10:37] framlin: dfsfdf: what I would like to see is a text-oriented browser (like lynx) that is able to eval JavaScript to be able to let "modern" sites runing via console. that should be possible with nodejs
[10:37] Abacab: I'm STILL a little blury on what's 'node' centric'
[10:37] Abacab: I guess it uses a piece of code that's 'node.js' ? 
[10:37] Abacab: and that core piece ? 
[10:37] Abacab: is code that wraps async event handling ?

[10:38] blueadept: like whatever it might be
[10:39] blueadept: i like node because of the programming style
[10:39] Abacab: hmm- I came into the www with lynx from VMS
[10:39] blueadept: some people dont like that, and use ruby or python
[10:39] Abacab: reading framlin's comment
[10:39] blueadept: i'm just glad there's a way to program on the server side using a function type language with as much as support as node has right now
[10:39] zilch has joined the channel
[10:39] Abacab: ah
[10:39] Abacab: I see
[10:39] Abacab: so bye bye php- bye bye asp / asp.net  perl cgi
[10:40] Abacab: hello server side js
[10:40] Abacab: why does node seem to have cornered that ? 
[10:40] blueadept: yeah i think windows just got support actually
[10:40] Abacab: why isn't it just called server side js ? 
[10:40] blueadept: so we're going to start to see more former asp programmingers moving to node perhaps
[10:40] Abacab: OI
[10:40] blueadept: there's been other server side javascript
[10:40] blueadept: but they never did really well
[10:40] Abacab: I'm a former asp developer - lol
[10:40] Abacab: I WAS happy with the five base objects I had to work with
[10:41] blueadept: node.js is the first servier side javascript language to catch on
[10:41] Abacab: I WAS happy with ISAPI mapping.
[10:41] Abacab: blue- that's just it though
[10:41] Abacab: I am not sure to call it a language
[10:41] Abacab: just a package
[10:41] Abacab: or library
[10:41] Abacab: seems it USES js
[10:42] dfsfdf: so what's the single most important advance that led to node? v8? libevent? a new philosophy?
[10:42] Abacab: but -is a base class library for asycn i/o
[10:42] blueadept: v8 was huge i think
[10:42] blueadept: plus more and more people are writing real-time applications
[10:42] Abacab: I don't see how v8 comes into node
[10:42] Abacab: v8 is v8
[10:42] Abacab: and v8 was in of itself - a great success I think
[10:42] Abacab: but I'm not sure how node inherits any glamour from v8
[10:43] Abacab: would be to short the functionality of node
[10:43] Abacab: and that brings me BACK to my original questions
[10:43] Abacab: what IS IT about node
[10:43] blueadept: i know but it's javascript -> machine code
[10:43] Abacab: that makes it so attractive ?
[10:43] Abacab: that wasn't out there already ? 
[10:43] Abacab: oh, I don't want to get into v8 JIT etc.
[10:43] dfsfdf: imo it's a compelling combination of ideas that were out there already
[10:43] Abacab: but - I just am curious about what it IS about node
[10:43] Abacab: that makes it
[10:44] Abacab: quite literally- that makes it
[10:44] blueadept: like i said, make some stuff and see how you like it. i've found myself building most of all my new projects in node
[10:44] Abacab: I COULD predicate with 'makes it what it is'
[10:44] iivvoo: abacab: first of all, its the hype in general, that cannot be always explained. I think
[10:44] Abacab: blue- so - you're saying - node will provide me with a framework
[10:44] iivvoo: also, serverside async javascript. It's something new but also well known
[10:44] Abacab: LIKE ASP
[10:44] iivvoo: people already know javascript
[10:44] Abacab: that I can accomplish server side issues

[10:44] Abacab: all with node ? 
[10:44] blueadept: abacab: people have built lightweight frameworks for all sorts of things using node.js
[10:44] benvds has joined the channel
[10:45] iivvoo: node.js can't do anything other systems can't either - it's all turing complete systems
[10:45] Abacab: I may have just passed the 80% mark !
[10:45] iivvoo: it's just the way how to do it
[10:45] zilch has joined the channel
[10:45] blueadept: ^
[10:45] Abacab: how 'alive' is node ?
[10:45] Abacab: does the framework grow ? 
[10:45] Abacab: will it 'be' ? 
[10:45] Abacab: or is it a fluke that will die ? 
[10:45] blueadept: there's a lot of people in this channel as you can see
[10:46] Abacab: SOUNDS like it will or can replace php
[10:46] blueadept: 600 is the average per day, everyday
[10:46] Abacab: good point there - 619 lol
[10:46] SubStack: every language dies eventually
[10:46] blueadept: and there are a lot of prolific contributors
[10:46] Abacab: SubStack - well- true
[10:46] Abacab: that's something Crockford would say lol
[10:46] SubStack: every corporation, every person, every great work of literature
[10:46] blueadept: i'm sure in 5 or 10 years another language will come along. but right now javascript is getting a lot of support
[10:47] blueadept: abacab: http://expressjs.com/
[10:47] blueadept: take a look at that framework for http functions
[10:47] zilch has joined the channel
[10:47] blueadept: its something i use a lot in most of all my projects, but its a lightweight way of building http servers for instance
[10:48] framlin: Abacab: I can only tell it for me. I code JS as my daily languange on large FAt-Clients (XUL/JS). Now there is a simple to use "application-server" that runs on linux and gives me access to the whole system using my alldays favourite language JavaScript

[10:50] blueadept: which is a great way of doing remote functions from client to server
[10:50] framlin: before nodejs I used a mix of awk, sed, perl php scripts to do that thnings, now I use nodejs becaus it gives me acces to the system and JavaScript
[10:50] maushu: I have news!

[10:55] noder1: formidable gets the file uploads nicely, but nodemailer expects Buffer in attachment list
[10:55] noder1: and formidable only gives a File with a WritableStream attached..
[10:56] maushu: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=7gGyL77d
[10:56] maushu: ahahahahaha
[10:56] noder1: what's the easiest way to solve this? (thought of hacking formidable to open a ReadableStream at the same time, but then need to convert the Stream into Buffer)

[11:03] Abacab: and it's similar ? 
[11:03] Abacab: I can start to handle requests and responses ? 
[11:03] Abacab: using node.js ? is that a big part of it ? 
[11:03] Abacab: that it's a server side 'handling' solution for a web server ? 
[11:03] Abacab: I am guessing I'm 90% on that one
[11:04] Abacab: but just asking that general question 
[11:04] Abacab: and btw- Substack- very neat you chimed in there- I consider you to be one of the ones that gets many things !

[11:06] Abacab: I JUST made that youtube video my start page.
[11:06] Abacab: why do you say that about Linus ?

[11:06] Abacab: so community oriented.
[11:07] AAA_awright: Or even human.
[11:07] Abacab: I never did get far in that text adventure
[11:07] Abacab: I managed to put the fish in the slot

[11:09] Abacab: I did actually code in COBOL once and have it compile first time- lol - SCARY SPUD there- 
[11:09] AAA_awright: Abacab: HTTP is just one protocol that Node.js implements because it's so widely used, the essence of Node.js is also it's motto: Evented I/O
[11:09] Abacab: I'm amazing there is ALWAYS human error involved.  My case - it's USUALLY syntactically - not logic.
[11:09] Abacab: but those logic errors are harder to track indeed.

[12:03] astropirate: TheJH, Node uses V8. V8 uses a Just In Time compiler. my knowlage in this area is limited. But it examines the code and compiles the code the most efficient way depending on how its being used
[12:03] astropirate: so I don't think precompiled code would work the way it works with PHP
[12:04] TheJH: Astro, I think that v8 will first compile the code and then apply optimizations later (but I could well be wrong, I don't know how it actually works)

[12:23] tbranyen: callable in presto and v8, not in spidermonkey from my testing
[12:23] chjj: yeah, i figured
[12:23] misterm: chjj: I think maybe a script attribute, or maybe something similar to strict mode
[12:23] chjj: if theyre going to break backward compat like that
[12:23] chjj: they have to

[12:31] misterm: chjj: yea either mime type or perhaps a new script type etc
[12:32] DennisRas: I've been using node and npm for a LONG time and that basically meant I had old versions. Now I want to update them and that failed badly so I decided to reinstall. Got node installed now but npm just wont install. getting errors every single time :/ any help here with npm or should I look elsewhere? (yes I did google for about 5 hours now)
[12:32] chjj: well, if theyre doing that, i want them to get it right, i want them to go all the way and break backward compat like crazy
[12:32] TheJH: DennisRas, gist your errors, please

[12:43] DennisRas: TheJH: Actually found a similar issue (didn't last time I checked). hopefully getting a response soon
[12:44] DennisRas: NPM just makes it easier to install modules aye? how do I install them manually?
[12:44] DennisRas: just place them in node_modules?
[12:45] chjj: bnoordhuis: did ArrayBuffers land in 0.5.4?
[12:45] bnoordhuis: chjj: typed arrays? yes
[12:45] TheJH: DennisRas, yes. but if the module has dependencies, you have to download them in node_modules/someModule/node_modules
[12:45] DennisRas: uhm
[12:46] DennisRas: any alternative to npm?

[14:15] Sembiance: I first discovered mongoose but upon learning that it forces you to make a schema, I was disgusted that I needed a schema to use a schemaless database. I eventually realized the mongoose is NOT a mongodb client, but a whole ORM layer. Since I just wanted a mongodb client, I started using node-mongolian, and I've recently ditched that for the pure native mongodb module
[14:16] dkris has joined the channel

[14:18] zilch has joined the channel
[14:18] nibblebot: there's no ORM
[14:18] nibblebot: mongo is not a relational database

[14:29] Sembiance: Like 'for example' if I had to model rooms of a role playing game, and each room was connected to other rooms, and each room had a bunch of objects that may be in the room, or players that may be in the room, a graph database is a perfect fit for that data

[14:40] baudehlo: no, fair enough. How often does it flush to disk?
[14:42] Sembiance: baudehlo: you can configure that. You specific how many minutes must pass and how many operations must have taken place.  So you could save every minute if at least 1,000 transactions took place. You can specificy multiple criteria, so you could also say save every 15 minutes if at least 1 transaction took place, etc.
[14:42] Sembiance: baudehlo: I'm currently saving every 15 minutes.
[14:42] baudehlo: and can you force a write?
[14:42] Sembiance: baudehlo: yup
[14:42] baudehlo: presumably some sort of safe shutdown also writes to disk?
[14:42] Sembiance: baudehlo: writes are background processes, they don't block the server, so they are pretty painless to do
[14:43] zilch has joined the channel
[14:43] Sembiance: baudehlo: yup, 'SHUTDOWN' will flush to disk then close the server
[14:43] baudehlo: cool.
[14:43] baudehlo: sorry for all the Q's. I'm curious about redis but a bit scared to think about using an in-memory database for anything I wouldn't want to lose.
[14:44] Sembiance: yah, if it's important that no data be lost, then don't store it in redis. but I think for many websites, there is a lot of data that isn't critical.

[15:11] GottZ: its just that require.path doesnt work anymore
[15:11] bradleymeck: yellowbean no, windows' loader does not function the same so support for C++ addons in windows is not done (might be done in 0.6.x?)
[15:12] GottZ: the chat example of socket.io has this line: require.paths.unshift(__dirname + '/../../lib/');

[15:14] jonaslund: yellowbean: It was quite recently that they started making proper project files for MSVC, but how to handle modules was not defined at that point
[15:14] yellowbean: So the only way of extending node functions on the windows side is by compiling it in to the source?

[15:17] butu5: I would like to dump some mustache template code in <script> tag in jade template
[15:17] GottZ: check out google closure compiler
[15:17] JacobSingh: I know of jake, but it seems like a whole "thing" to setup.  I remember something else similar, but can't remember the name
[15:17] GottZ: for minifiing
[15:17] butu5: any idea?
[15:17] jonaslund: bnoordhuis: not impossible with one way to do things... however making something orthogonal with *nix and then cygwin/mingw/msvc on win32... *shudder*
[15:18] tbranyen: JacobSingh: its very simple to do with cat and uglifyjs
[15:18] Sembiance: JacobSingh: I just wrote my own. It 'cat's all the files together than runs YUICompressor on them. I do remember reading about some tools to help do this for you

[15:18] tbranyen: to maintain copyrights
[15:18] tbranyen: if you use 3rd party shit
[15:18] yellowbean: bradleymeck: Okay that helps, normally I would use linux based OS but  we have some c++ extentions developed for windows and nodeJs looks very promissing to wrap this functions inside of some native extentions
[15:19] kenperkins has joined the channel
[15:19] jonaslund: bnoordhuis: A reason i think it would be good to get "something" out there is that people are continually writing node bindings for libs on other platforms and the longer it's postponed the bigger mess (or larger amount of complaints) is gonna be the result the day it's finally decided

[15:19] GottZ: cygwin kinda sux. recently i refreshed my install and put node v0.4.10 on it.. well.. something went wrong with cygwin and i got a file locked out. was no longer able to delete that file though i do know how to manipulate acl tables in ntfs
[15:20] Sembiance: tbranyen: nah, I'd rather have all my javascript super tiny, copyright notices be damned. I always have an 'about' section on the site that mentions the stuff I use and their licenses and when you view-source I have a HTML comment above the minified script include that points to /index-dev.html  where you can see all the original source files included, un-minified
[15:20] GottZ: then i booted into linux, mounted my ntfs partition and deleted it.. but ya.. cygwin kinda scared me now.
[15:20] jonaslund: GottZ: ahh it was a file with a weird name?
[15:20] GottZ: na
[15:20] tbranyen: Sembiance: i guess as someone who respects other developers efforts, i would consider that incredibly selfish and misguided
[15:20] tktiddle: :) node is alright you know
[15:20] GottZ: it was just a usual file
[15:20] GottZ: on one of my windows test servers there it locked out cygwin.ico
[15:20] bradleymeck: jonaslund, on the other hand like 90% of the C++ modules would have to be ported, and dll inclusion for windows for things that arent built into the system would be painful
[15:20] tbranyen: Sembiance: those copyrights are meant to be in the source
[15:20] GottZ: wich is just the icon of cygwin stored in the root directory of cygwin
[15:20] jonaslund: GottZ: I remember having something like what you describe and googling some turned up that you needed to delete it via a "unc" path
[15:20] Bogh has joined the channel
[15:20] tbranyen: thats why they were placed there in the first place
[15:21] GottZ: well i deleted it through linux
[15:21] Sembiance: tbranyen: They are still there when you go to the /index-dev.html page which I point people too.
[15:21] GottZ: but ya. i was not even able to claim ownership of that file

[15:24] bradleymeck: jonaslund including things like libmysql or libsfml or libsndfile, which would be rather odd to have to run build scripts for
[15:24] Sembiance: tbranyen: even putting the copy-right notices in the obfuscated/minified versions, there is no way anyone would ever see it. One massive line, 40,000 characters long or something and somewhere hidden in there is a comment that would say /* Copyright so and so 2006 none@none.net */   I view my technique of both mentioning what I use in the UI itself AND providing the full, un-obfuscated source with complete in-tact copyright notices as plenty re

[15:58] bradleymeck: duko : 1. name your functions and dont use anonymous callbacks that dont need a closure 2. if you need a closure ask if this task is independant of what it is nested inside and put it into a generator function 3. Keep your tasks small and combine them

[17:44] creationix: you probably want the return, but that's just for local control-flow

[17:44] tjholowaychuk: nothing fancy
[17:44] tjholowaychuk: the retval doesn't matter
[17:45] kevwil: tjholowaychuk: ok ... but I want the retval, I want to pass a message back to the main app

[17:49] tjholowaychuk: you cant really return it to the app like you want
[17:49] kevwil: tjholowaychuk: nothing I try to do works well with node apps :~P
[17:49] tjholowaychuk: haha
[17:49] tjholowaychuk: it's just different, just need to get used to it
[17:49] creationix: kevwil: the return value of next is always "undefined'
[17:49] tjholowaychuk: in many ways it's nicer because you HAVE to consider error handling

[18:05] teadict: aw
[18:06] bradleymeck: GrooveJuiced, it is slow in everything, and always will be (has to tokenize and parse and analyze and code gen and run), compared to say... a normal function which only does the last (which is generally fairly cheap by comparison)

[19:23] leeda: TheJH: haha yeah
[19:24] TheJH: leeda, I think that omitting "lib/" worked some time ago, but it was eventually removed from node core

[19:48] mikeal has joined the channel
[19:48] GottZ: well
[19:48] GottZ: wait
[19:48] TheJH: garrensmith, "most downloaded" would require inspecting the server logs, and as npms db is running on a couch-specific service, I doubt that it's possible
[19:48] tjholowaychuk: for windows?
[19:48] TheJH: GottZ, the native path module has some related stuff
[19:48] TheJH: GottZ, have a look at the path docs
[19:48] GottZ: https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus/blob/master/lib/utils.js#L31
[19:49] GottZ: this was the problem in stylus wich made it impossible to work in windows

[19:50] jhurliman: thanks
[19:50] TheJH: jhurliman, for 0.x, reinstall
[19:51] jhurliman: npm ERR! TypeError: Cannot call method 'filter' of undefined (https://gist.github.com/1149986)
[19:52] mscdex: seems like a bug in stylus, not in node

[19:54] isaacs: ircretary: inst jhurliman 
[19:54] ircretary: jhurliman: `curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh` (or, if there are permission issues, you can try: `curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh`)
[19:54] isaacs: jhurliman: 1.0.10 and before didnt' self-update properly
[19:54] jhurliman: thanks
[19:54] TheJH: isaacs, is that a usual error message?
[19:55] TheJH: isaacs, and is the "npm ERR! TypeError: Cannot call method 'filter' of undefined" specific to it?
[19:55] DennisRasmussen: Tidwell, which module? node-mysql or another?
[19:55] jhurliman: ack! it is threatening to uninstall all of my packages. i'll do this again later when i can shutdown a few things first
[19:56] jhurliman: thanks for the tips
[19:56] isaacs: jhurliman: it tries to clean up all 0.x-installed things
[19:56] DennisRasmussen: Tidwell, node-mysql gives me an error: unknown and wont connect while node-db-mysql just gives this: http://i.imgur.com/blmxI.png -.-
[19:56] isaacs: jhurliman: because npm 0.x is an abomination
[19:57] isaacs: jhurliman: you can `curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | clean=no sh` to skip the clean process
[19:57] jhurliman: ah. i thought everything was installed with the current npm (1.0.6) but maybe i had an older version previously
[19:57] jhurliman: either way, it looks like there have been 19 releases since 1.0.6 and the current version
[19:58] chrisdickinson: isaacs: out of curiosity, you mentioned wanting to integrate npm with git.js a while back -- what exactly did you need git.js to do?

[19:59] tbranyen: oh hey chrisdickinson 
[19:59] chrisdickinson: tbranyen: hey!
[19:59] tbranyen: yeah i think you're right about the deflate stuff
[19:59] isaacs: chrisdickinson: well, i have this thing where i parse dependency urls and do a git checkout.  also, there's a `npm submodule` thing that checks out the repo url as a submodule into ./node_modules/pkgname
[19:59] tbranyen: i finally got a chance last night to mess with git.js a bit
[19:59] chrisdickinson: tbranyen: you should check out my fork -- I've got the commonjs modules in place, and i've web-workerized the zlib stuff
[19:59] tbranyen: chrisdickinson: holy crap nice
[20:00] isaacs: chrisdickinson: mostly, i need it to do all the stuff it already does (which looks really really good), but do it without munging require.paths or leaking globals.
[20:00] chrisdickinson: tbranyen: it's all on feature/commonjs branch
[20:00] dreamdust has joined the channel
[20:00] chrisdickinson: isaacs: cool. I've got fixes for the global leakage and the require.paths munging.
[20:00] isaacs: chrisdickinson: ..."zlib stuff"?
[20:01] edude03 has joined the channel
[20:01] chrisdickinson: isaacs: git relies pretty heavily on rawinflate/rawdeflate. git.js has a native javascript copy of each of those
[20:01] isaacs: chrisdickinson: should i be excited about that?
[20:01] isaacs: chrisdickinson: because that sounds like i should be excited about it.
[20:01] jasonmog has left the channel
[20:01] TheJH: isaacs, does that issue only appear for self-updating or also for installing/updating normal stuff?
[20:01] guillermo has joined the channel
[20:01] isaacs: chrisdickinson: can that be used to un/pack gzip?
[20:01] tbranyen: where is the webworker stuff?
[20:01] chrisdickinson: isaacs: haha. I've been in contact with danlucraft and he seems receptive to the changes thus far
[20:02] fly-away has joined the channel
[20:02] isaacs: TheJH: only for self-updating.  the issue is that it deletes a file it needs before it needs it.
[20:02] chrisdickinson: isaacs: I'm not sure if it does gzip -- actually, I'm 90% sure it doesn't.
[20:02] tbranyen: ah found it
[20:02] isaacs: ACTION gets less excited.
[20:02] TheJH: isaacs, ok, I'll add that to my bots brain
[20:02] chrisdickinson: isaacs: but, it will do raw inflate and deflate, even in browser.
[20:02] isaacs: chrisdickinson: i'd like to free npm from any dependencies on external unix programs.  gzip, tar, and git, to be specific
[20:03] arthurdebert has joined the channel
[20:03] jesusabdullah: How close are you now, isaacs ?
[20:03] chrisdickinson: isaacs: totally. I'm not sure how far you'd have to go to add in gzip support to rawdeflate. it might be a case of adding the missing block types
[20:03] jhbot has joined the channel
[20:04] TheJH: ok... this is a test, please ignore, https://gist.github.com/1149986
[20:04] jhbot: TheJH, that version of npm doesn't cleanly self-update, use `curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh`
[20:04] TheJH: :)
[20:04] neilk_ has joined the channel
[20:04] chrisdickinson: tbranyen: yeah: https://github.com/chrisdickinson/git.js/blob/feature%2Fcommonjs/lib/git/zlib.js p.s., holy crap, webworkers + blobbuilder = awesome.
[20:04] isaacs: jesusabdullah: well, i'm hoping git.js gets to the point where it can do all the git stuff that npm does, and i've got a start of a tar parser (can parse anything, but the writer is broken), and i think the plan is to get gzip support into core at some point
[20:04] mscdex: here's something that parses tarballs in the browser: https://gist.github.com/408333
[20:05] isaacs: mscdex: doesn't handle extended pax headers
[20:05] mscdex: eh, i haven't delved into the format, so i don't know about any of that :-)
[20:05] jesusabdullah: Interesting!
[20:05] chrisdickinson: isaacs: also, the smart http remotes in git.js work now -- and i do believe they speak the same wire protocol as git://, so that might be easy to add as well.
[20:05] isaacs: mscdex: the tar format has embedded within it the history of the file system.
[20:05] tbranyen: did workers never make it into node
[20:05] tbranyen: thought i read before there was experimental support
[20:05] tbranyen: ?
[20:06] MooGoo: child process has built in message passing in .5
[20:06] chrisdickinson: the big issue is that it's dog slow at the moment. I just got done writing a little instrumentation lib that hooks on to require.extensions and I'll be using that to see where improvements can be made.
[20:06] MooGoo: or whatever the version is
[20:06] igl: node has child processes
[20:06] isaacs: tbranyen: var child = process.fork("child.js"); child.send({a: "message}); child.on("message", function (m) { console.log("got a message", m) })
[20:06] MooGoo: pretty recent tho
[20:06] chrisdickinson: isaacs: it would be really cool to enable a blob-builder style for forking a process.
[20:06] isaacs: tbranyen: then, in child.js:  process.on("message", ...0
[20:06] MooGoo: had to roll your own interface for awhile
[20:07] isaacs: chrisdickinson: blob-builder style?
[20:07] tbranyen: chrisdickinson: isn't that close to what a buffer is?

[20:07] Kochpfanne has joined the channel
[20:07] ryankee has left the channel
[20:07] chrisdickinson: isaacs: tbranyen: yeah. the gist is that in browser, you use a blob builder to construct a blob of javascript, then you can get an object url and pass it to web workers.
[20:08] chrisdickinson: well, to the Worker function itself, and it'll treat it like "new Worker(url)"
[20:08] Kochpfanne: How I can install that thing on Windows: ../build/default/binding ?
[20:08] NodeDance: How can I best convert an array into XML?
[20:08] ryankee has joined the channel
[20:08] NodeDance: Other than something like array.join()
[20:08] chrisdickinson: so instead of having to rely on an actual, physical file being present (or available on the web, in the case of web workers), you can dynamically create a file and create a worker out of it.
[20:09] TheJH: chrisdickinson, wow, didn't know that "gist" actually is an english word... :D
[20:09] micheil: chrisdickinson: hey, btw, your REPL thing you wrote, thanks for teaching me how to interact with node via a REPL
[20:09] TheJH: NodeDance, depends on what you want the array to look like
[20:09] chrisdickinson: micheil: no prob!
[20:10] tbranyen: chrisdickinson: holy shit i had no idea about that either
[20:10] tbranyen: xD

[20:10] frodenius: w000t

[20:11] NodeDance: Wow, awesome

[20:11] Nexxy: ACTION cringes
[20:11] igl: ACTION runs
[20:12] Nexxy: by choice?
[20:12] NodeDance: The old SOAP web service is written in Python and it is *slooooooooooow*
[20:12] amerine has joined the channel
[20:12] Nexxy: ok but
[20:12] Nexxy: why soap
[20:12] NodeDance: Like, eight seconds to give 12 results
[20:12] Nexxy: are you forced to work with some sadistic vendor?
[20:12] TheJH: I wish we had kohai here...
[20:12] Nexxy: soap is the epitome of reinventing the wheel
[20:12] Nexxy: it'd ridiculous
[20:12] NodeDance: Nexxy: Management is serious about SOAP
[20:12] TheJH: AvianFlu, I need kohai!!! "!insult XML"
[20:12] Nexxy: NodeDance, find new management
[20:12] wink_: if only soap were as well designed as a wheel
[20:12] Nexxy: rofl
[20:13] wink_: its more like inventing a brick while trying to invent the wheel
[20:13] MooGoo: .insult XML
[20:13] catb0t: XML does not understand the glory of getting ssh to work in fullscreen on your phonr
[20:13] Kochpfanne: Download for require('../build/default/binding'); ?
[20:13] TheJH: MooGoo, :)
[20:13] MooGoo: it really doesnt
[20:14] TheJH: we need a huge insult database everyone can integrate into his bot :D
[20:14] Nexxy: NodeDance, fwiw i'd just use .join('') or something ;3
[20:14] chrisdickinson: isaacs: anyway, in summary: I've been chatting with danlucraft, and he seems really amenable to landing the aforementioned changes, so you should be able to use git.js within the next week or so (hopefully.)
[20:14] isaacs: chrisdickinson: that's way sooner than i need it, so that rocks :)
[20:14] bradleymeck: nodedance : https://github.com/hij1nx/JUP
[20:14] isaacs: chrisdickinson: really, though, tar and gzip are sooo much more painful to lack than git, since they're needed for every install, and are much less portable
[20:15] MooGoo: can always use .insultadd
[20:15] TheJH: MooGoo, wow! :)
[20:15] MooGoo: it's not that exciting
[20:15] TheJH: MooGoo, what's the syntax? Some placeholder or so?
[20:15] MooGoo: most of the insults are from some chan of freaks on some other irc network

Born in Bay City, Michigan, she moved to New York City in 1977 to pursue a career in modern dance. After performing in the music groups Breakfast Club and Emmy, she released her debut album in 1983. She followed it with a series of albums by which she found immense popularity by pushing the boundaries of lyrical content in mainstream po

[21:18] Taai: chrisdickinson: So, that means that if I use http server class and, for example, I make the callback function to run for ~ 5 seconds   while (Date.now() < endTime) {}   , the other requests to the webserver would wait?
[21:18] micheil: (tangentially, websockets draft-10 no longer needs it)
[21:18] bluesmoon: TheJH: I've submitted a few patches for cradle to make it work in 0.5.x
[21:18] chrisdickinson: Taai: yep.
[21:18] TheJH: bluesmoon, ah, ok
[21:18] blueadept2: anyone use this async lib? https://github.com/fjakobs/async.js
[21:18] bluesmoon: TheJH: in particular, require.paths and http.getAgent
[21:18] micheil: ryah: so, you'd have:   server.on('upgrade', function(req, socket) {})
[21:19] micheil: in all honesty it should have never been a third arguement.
[21:19] micheil: it should have been hanging off the request object

[21:50] ryah: i'll do v0.4.11 this week but i doubt we'll make it to .12

[21:51] martypdx: @AvianFlu yes, will try w/o -g. should it be fine on both .4.10 and .5.x?

[21:51] AvianFlu: and you should use 0.4.x
[21:51] AvianFlu: what kind of error do you get?
[21:52] martypdx: node-waf-configure build
[21:52] micheil: ryah: I can't commit time to do it, as I need to get v2.0.00 of node-websocket-server out by monday.
[21:52] micheil: `3rdEden: could you backport that?

[21:55] `3rdEden: sorry
[21:55] singkong: Hello, anybody knows how to build node.js for android?
[21:55] AvianFlu: oh, martypdx, you need to be root or sudo'd to do a -g install
[21:55] AvianFlu: sudo npm install forever -g
[21:55] AvianFlu: or use su and just do it as root
[21:55] AvianFlu: or whatever you might need to do on your machine
[21:57] martypdx: yeah, i just realized that. usually I have been doing npm set unsafe-perm true. I'm a unix/linux n00b, so I'm not sure about root. I ssh'd in as root@IP, so not sure why i would not be? sudo is not recognized as command, do I need to do something for that?
[21:57] micheil: ryah: I would do it, but it needs testing to check that it doesn't have any side-effects, and I can't do that testing right now
[21:57] micheil: ryah: is there anyone else who knows that code and uses that could do it?
[21:57] ryah: micheil: me :)
[21:58] AvianFlu: martypdx do you see a # at the end of your prompt?
[21:58] martypdx: yes
[21:58] micheil: ryah: but you probably don't have time to do it either.
[21:58] AvianFlu: so you're root, but you're getting permission denied
[21:58] TheJH: complex search for npm with &|() done :) https://github.com/isaacs/npm/pull/1275
[21:59] TheJH: meh, why is isaacs offline now?
[21:59] AvianFlu: can you do a ls -al on that path and see if you own the stuff?

[22:02] guidocalvano: I'd like to be able to do something like this: Object.prototype.accessProperty = function( name ) { console.log( name ) ; return 5 ; } ;
[22:02] AvianFlu: martypdx: if something was set non-writable, you'd see the same error message
[22:03] AvianFlu: so that's one thing to look for
[22:03] guidocalvano: such that if I do this: var o = new Object() ; o.bla ;
[22:03] soapyillusions has joined the channel
[22:03] guidocalvano: it will print bla to the command line
[22:03] guidocalvano: and it will return 5

[22:04] softdrink: guidocalvano:  you can only do it for specific properties. there's no generic property manipulation hook that i know of
[22:04] AvianFlu: you can paste me the list if it's nothing sensitive, I can read those fast

[22:04] micheil: ryah: ah, okay. I didn't know about that; I'm only just getting back into contributing to node.js stuff

[23:04] AvianFlu: "worth the effort" is impossible to quantify, really
[23:04] AvianFlu: vim is sweet, but so are a few graphical IDEs
[23:04] AvianFlu: I use sublime text 2, which is pretty cool
[23:04] TruPpp: okay
[23:05] AvianFlu: there's also GEdit for gnome and Kate/Kdevelop for KDE
[23:05] tjholowaychuk: TruPpp dont worry about it too much unless navigating files / typing is really a bottleneck
[23:05] TruPpp: basically i dont need more than notepad++ provides
[23:05] iammerrick: TruPpp: The natural port from notepad++ is gedit I thouygh
[23:05] AvianFlu: or there's nano, the regular man's text editor
