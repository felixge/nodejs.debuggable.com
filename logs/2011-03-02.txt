[00:41] nivoc has joined the channel
[00:42] ryah: piscisaureus: what kind of object?
[00:42] piscisaureus: pquerna: I need to use a "overlapped" structure for every read / write. I'm thinking about encapsulating that in a more generic "async operation" object that is created for every async action performed. 
[00:42] piscisaureus: (this is in the context of iocp, so you tell windows to do something, it then tells you when your read/write/connect etc is done)
[00:42] piscisaureus: I know that ryah wants a different implementation too so when a node user is wondering why his app won't exit he can somehow tell which async operations are "in progress".
[00:42] piscisaureus: just a class of some kind or a struct maybe
[00:43] ryah: piscisaureus: it might be okay but it probably shouldn't be a ObjectWrap
[00:43] piscisaureus: could be an objectwrap so we could expose this object to JS land
[00:43] piscisaureus: oh. 
[00:43] piscisaureus: is that expensive?
[00:43] ryah: allocating and collecting ObjectWraps has proven expensive
[00:44] ryah: what about just a pointer?
[00:44] piscisaureus: pointer to what?
[00:45] piscisaureus: ryah: we could not use an objectwrap but maintain a linked list of operations in progress
[00:45] piscisaureus: ryah: then we expose a process.something getter that collects all operations and transforms them in JS objects
[00:46] piscisaureus: For windows that would be really convenient but I don't know how it would work out on linux

[01:11] EyePulp: var io = require('socket.io');
[01:11] EyePulp:     socket = io.listen(server);
[01:12] tmzt: you aren't using nginx either?
[01:13] EyePulp: not at the moment.  maybe eventually, we're not in production yet
[01:13] EyePulp: I believe it would still work the same way on the socket side to attach to the server.
[01:13] fly-away has joined the channel
[01:13] tmzt: so maybe nginx is the problem, I guess I could run the socket.io on a different port, do browsers care if the origin is the same?
[01:14] cainus: hey all... can anyone help me with a sanity check?  I've got a working server, but it won't respond when I run it as root on a different machine.  I can even run two copies on the same port (80) without an error.   Can anyone think of what might be wrong?
[01:15] EyePulp: socket.io requests come through just like any http request, except under foo.com/socket.io/  I doubt nginx is the problem, but eliminating it might make finding the issue easier.

[01:27] brianc: piscisaureus: I know in the .NET framework they have a class you can use to do async socket operations without allocating a new object every time
[01:28] brianc: piscisaureus: it's called "AsyncEventArgs."  You're supposed to allocate a set number of them & reuse them for each operation...they're for "high performance networking applications"
[01:28] piscisaureus: brianc: we're not using .NET. And do you know what the runtime does under the hood?
[01:28] brianc: piscisaureus: I know you're not using .NET. :) I am not sure, but I could try and dig something up for you
[01:29] brianc: piscisaureus: you still have to allocate "n" where "n" is the number of expected simultaneous, outstanding async operations
[01:30] piscisaureus: ah so it is some kind of freelist prolly
[01:30] piscisaureus: can use that

[01:31] themiddleman_itv has joined the channel
[01:32] brianc: piscisaureus: yah only reason I brought it up is because in .NET 3.5 they had "beginasync" and "endasync" for each socket operation, and eacho socket operation resulted in allocating a new object returned from the "begin" method.  That proved to be unreasonably expensive for high-performance networking, so they came up w/ a new API.  I was just reading it and thought maybe knowing about it would help you out.  I know
[01:32] brianc:  the runtime is way, way different than .NET but I figure the doods writing .NET know a thing or two about windows networking
[01:33] brianc: I, on the other hand, do not. :(

[05:10] Steven__: i'm doing JSON.stringify(obj).length as the Content-Length
[05:10] wadey: yeah, you need Buffer.byteLength
[05:10] Steven__: on the string right?
[05:10] Steven__: yeah
[05:10] Steven__: lemme try..
[05:10] Tprice has joined the channel
[05:11] wadey: yeah, on the string

[05:32] ncb000gt: you're setting fname in a callback for the redis client
[05:33] ncb000gt: this maybe (and should almost always be) slower than the next statement of execution
[05:33] somebody: it says fname is not defined
[05:33] ncb000gt: somebody: right
[05:33] ncb000gt: that's because it isn't
[05:34] ncb000gt: when the code is executed fname doesn't exist
[05:34] ncb000gt: this is what happens

[05:34] ncb000gt: oh god
[05:34] ncb000gt: lol
[05:35] ncb000gt: ok, you setup a callback for the 'connect' event on the redis client
[05:35] somebody: yeah
[05:35] ncb000gt: then the next code to execute is the res.writehead
[05:35] ncb000gt: and then res.write
[05:35] ncb000gt: and then res.end
[05:36] somebody: so fname is only valid withing the client.on(....
[05:36] ncb000gt: somewhere there may be a connect event that fires, but it's never going to fire before your res.write function evaluates
[05:36] ncb000gt: somebody: no, but it only gets set _after_ the res.*'s execute
[05:36] somebody: hmm
[05:36] ncb000gt: here, take a look
[05:37] jashkenas has joined the channel
[05:37] somebody: what if i move the client.on block above the http.createServer
[05:37] ncb000gt: somebody: http://pastebin.com/T0tD1Vbr
[05:37] somebody: or does it not work like that?
[05:37] ncb000gt: that is an option
[05:37] somebody: hmm i see i think
[05:38] ncb000gt: somebody: keep in mind that you are dealing with highly asynchronous systems here
[05:38] ncb000gt: some are not, but many of the libraries and functions you'll be calling will use the asynchronous model to do things
[05:39] ncb000gt: which means that you can't assume that one thing will happen before the other, hence why the callbacks are so important
[05:39] abrahamwilliams has joined the channel
[05:39] ncb000gt: because they guarantee that your method has executed the way you expected
[05:39] somebody: im not 100% sure what you mean by by call backs...
[05:39] ncb000gt: somebody: when you do client.on('event', function() {});
[05:40] ncb000gt: the function() {} part of that is a callback
[05:40] ncb000gt: aka a function pointer
[05:40] somebody: but how does that make it go in order?
[05:40] ncb000gt: you are passing a function pointer along to the 'on' method, and when the 'on' method is ready to it will callback to your function point
[05:40] ncb000gt: er
[05:41] somebody: hmm
[05:41] rfay has joined the channel
[05:41] ncb000gt: somebody: by using the libraries you're assuming that someone has taken care of making sure that the function executed
[05:41] ncb000gt: in the order you wanted
[05:41] dnolen has joined the channel
[05:41] ncb000gt: i may be explaining this poorly too

[05:41] somebody: kinda makes sense.
[05:41] dominictarr__: ah. I should have POSTed it. that worked.
[05:41] ncb000gt: somebody: in theory, having a good understanding of the underlying system is important to using node properly
[05:42] ncb000gt: but you don't need to know all the intricacies
[05:42] somebody: heh, i definately dont have that
[05:42] kriszyp2 has joined the channel
[05:42] ncb000gt: somebody: use it long enough and it'll click

[05:45] somebody: hmm that doesn't seem to work either, i just get a blank page (doesn't crash, though!)
[05:45] ncb000gt: somebody: i suspect it has to do with the client.on('connect' piece

[05:46] marcello3d: we put a http server inside your http server

[05:48] garrensmith has joined the channel
[05:48] garrensmith: morning all
[05:48] ncb000gt: marcello3d: an abstraction layer like mongoose or just a few convenience things?
[05:49] ncb000gt: garrensmith: night! :)
[05:49] marcello3d: I started by abstracting their cursor class, then got fed up with it, and accessed their collection class directly, then got fed up with that and started accessing the db class directly, and got fed up with that and started accessing their connection class directly
[05:49] garrensmith: ncb000gt: :-)
[05:49] marcello3d: ncb000gt: low level
[05:49] garrensmith: How do I set the NODE_ENV in code?
[05:49] marcello3d: think mongodb shell
[05:49] marcello3d: which I think is way easier to use than mongodb-native
[05:50] ncb000gt: marcello3d: gotcha
[05:50] marcello3d: but the mongodb-native code is kind of terrible :(
[05:50] marcello3d: I found several bugs in my journeys
[05:50] ncb000gt: garrensmith: i didn't think there was a point for doing that
[05:50] marcello3d: but now I'm using pretty low level pieces of mongodb-native
[05:51] siculars has joined the channel
[05:51] ncb000gt: you'd set it before you runthe node app

[05:51] marcello3d: so it's a lot cleaner/simpler
[05:51] marcello3d: my whole lib is under 400 lines
[05:51] garrensmith: ncb000gt: When I run my test framework I want the NODE_ENV to be set to test
[05:51] ncb000gt: garrensmith: hmm
[05:52] ncb000gt: garrensmith: i'm not sure if you can set it with `process.env = 'blah'`

[06:02] jacobolu_ has joined the channel
[06:02] ncb000gt: somebody: there is no data returned from get explicitly
[06:02] ncb000gt: it is passed to the callback function you specify
[06:03] ncb000gt: and res.write requires some data, a string, array, or buffer (as the error said)
[06:03] ncb000gt: so when you tried to use fname, it failed since there was no data
[06:03] somebody: yay works :)
[06:03] ncb000gt: :)
[06:03] ncb000gt: cool
[06:03] ncb000gt: somebody: do you understand why?
[06:03] somebody: just reading what you wrote now, gimme a sec ;p
[06:04] ncb000gt: somebody: sure :)
[06:04] somebody: so
[06:04] somebody: you are creating a new function with function (err, fname);
[06:05] somebody: or something
[06:05] jetienne_ has joined the channel
[06:05] ncb000gt: somebody: yes, that is the callback
[06:06] somebody: what does err stand for?
[06:06] ncb000gt: err stands for error
[06:06] ncb000gt: a "convention" that many apps use with node is to pass an error parameter as the first parameter if something goes wrong
[06:06] ncb000gt: there are a couple reasons for doing this
[06:07] ncb000gt: try/catch and error creation and quite slow in V*
[06:07] ncb000gt: erm V8
[06:07] ncb000gt: and, this is a slightly less "break my f*ing app" approach
[06:07] ncb000gt: rather than throwing errors for control flow, you pass them around to callbacks s othat people can do what they want with them
[06:07] somebody: so if there was an error, but it still returned my data, i'd get an error in fname instead of data?
[06:08] ncb000gt: somebody: not necessarily
[06:08] ncb000gt: it depends on the library
[06:08] somebody: ok
[06:08] ncb000gt: and it depends on what you're doing
[06:08] void_ has joined the channel
[06:08] somebody: but if i just did function (fname); i'd get no errors?
[06:08] ncb000gt: with some of the db libraries they will tell you the error details in the first param, and pass the results of whatever was passed back along
[06:08] Yuffster has joined the channel
[06:09] ncb000gt: somebody: no, if you did just function(fname) you'd either get an error or undefined/null
[06:09] ncb000gt: the library requires that your callback have those two parameters set up
[06:09] ncb000gt: i actually looked at the lib to make sure for the example
[06:10] somebody: ok
[06:10] somebody: what about the function(req, res); in the http.createServer?
[06:10] somebody: requet, response i assume?
[06:10] ncb000gt: somebody: yes
[06:11] somebody: so thats saying, get a request, then respond to it
[06:11] rfay has joined the channel
[06:11] ncb000gt: somebody: it provides you with the request, from the browser, and then provides you with a response so that you can send data back to the browser

[08:45] EyePulp: is there a way to start node and pass in a path for it to use (or add) to it's module paths?  or a programatic way to add a directory to the module paths within an app itself?

[08:48] pyrotechnick: EyePulp: yes there is
[08:49] EyePulp: require.paths.unshift('some/path');
[08:49] pyrotechnick: yes
[08:49] mscdex: i think there's an environment variable too
[08:49] pyrotechnick: unshifting it onto require.paths will add it as the top priority
[08:49] pyrotechnick: node will look in that path first
[08:50] EyePulp: Do I need to pass that to every sub-module?
[08:50] pyrotechnick: pushing it will add it to the lowest priority, node will look there last
[08:50] pyrotechnick: umm
[08:50] pyrotechnick: i was wondering this today
[08:50] pyrotechnick: never got around to checking it sorry, i just made it work
[08:50] pyrotechnick: im going to guess yes
[08:50] EyePulp: or does it become available to everything unerneath...
[08:50] pyrotechnick: youd have to check sorry
[08:50] pyrotechnick: im going to guess it's shared/global
[08:50] EyePulp: checking...
[08:50] pyrotechnick: but they did make some big changes to that a short time ago
[08:50] pyrotechnick: that broke alot of those assumptions
[08:51] pyrotechnick: let me know what you find out
[08:52] EyePulp: locally it looks like it's passed around, but it's on the public server it wasn't there, so let me push up...

[09:34] venom00ut has joined the channel
[09:38] mape: stagas: it just toStrings the functions and sends to a worker?
[09:39] stagas: mape: yeap but takes all the hassle out, should be good for most use cases
[09:39] muhqu_ has joined the channel
[09:39] stagas: mape: you just don't have access to your app's context
[09:39] mape: stagas: yeah, thought of using something like that for scraper, but yeah.. exactly
[09:39] mape: didn't like that
[09:40] mape: Not obvious to someone using it
[09:40] stagas: mape: I was using your scraper but I was doing like a lot of scrapes and my app was blocking a lot, so I came up with this
[09:41] mape: Yeah, it isn't really optimal now, to slow
[09:41] Level1 has joined the channel
[09:42] stagas: mape: the first argument is passed to the new jsdom.env that also fetches if it's an uri
[09:42] stagas: mape: so no need for request
[09:43] mape: yeah, I probly don't need req
[09:43] stagas: but you can pass it a body as well
[09:44] stagas: I like the first example in there, where you can pass an object with keys and get back an object with the keys+results bound together
[09:47] stagas: makes the app tidy having the scraper functions together and you can iterate immediately, res.thumbs.forEach etc.
[09:49] stagas: I only hope the worker passes messages in the correct order :) didn't test too much

[10:24] dominictarr_ has joined the channel
[10:25] stagas: jetienne: it just wraps them with brequire code on the fly. let me find it
[10:25] tmzt: jetienne: SubStack is working on that
[10:25] tmzt: part of browserify I think
[10:25] seivan: Hmm
[10:25] stagas: browserify is good also
[10:25] saschagehlich has joined the channel
[10:25] seivan: What's the best way to create some form of a queue for sockets?
[10:25] seivan: I don't want to spam the client Phones with loads of data at once...
[10:26] seivan: Right now I am simulating a queue by having a sleep (yes yes stupid)
[10:26] seivan: any ideas?
[10:26] jetienne: i wait to see what browserify is :)
[10:27] jetienne: but i would like something simple well defined. like brequire but with the missing js in the client :)
[10:28] SubStack: jetienne: bundling you mean? instead of synchronous xhr
[10:28] jetienne: seivan: you pick a maxrate, and stop sending msg when it has reach this rate. nothing magic
[10:29] seivan: jetienne: is this maxrate final? When it reaches 50, does it stop or does it start counting down?
[10:29] jetienne: SubStack: im in a browser, i do require('slota.js');, if not loaded, load it in sync. then do the eval to simulate require()
[10:30] jetienne: SubStack: the eval to simulate require() is already in brequire
[10:30] jetienne: SubStack: it should be possible to do a simple polyfill
[10:30] jetienne: seivan: this is a possibility. queue management is fun. start simple and improve when needed
[10:30] nmtmason has joined the channel
[10:31] seivan: haha
[10:31] seivan: true, but I am gonna look at  redis based solution

[10:33] masahiroh has joined the channel
[10:34] SubStack: jetienne: I don't like locking up the browser just to load a file
[10:34] augustl: is it common to connect to MySQL on i.e. every HTTP request? Or is it better to keep a connection open and reuse it across requests?
[10:35] jetienne: SubStack: this is the commonjs spec. i do understand it is not optimal
[10:35] saschagehlich: augustl: usually you just open up one connection
[10:35] saschagehlich: since everything on node is asynchronous you won't have any load problems there I guess
[10:35] saschagehlich: (at least that's the way I'm doing it)
[10:36] augustl: I'm used to connections being dropped for long running requests in Rails and other frameworks.
[10:36] saikat has joined the channel
[10:36] augustl: guess that's just a setting or something
[10:37] SubStack: jetienne: fuck commonjs then :p
[10:37] SubStack: I only care about loading node modules in the browser
[10:38] masahiroh has joined the channel
[10:38] xla has joined the channel
[10:38] jetienne: i care about being able to share code between client and server :)
[10:39] jetienne: SubStack: beyond blocking the browser, do you think to implement this is possible ? like any big blocker ?
[10:40] jetienne: stagas: about scrapping on server, have you looked at phantomjs ? it run all the usual stuff from a browser, just no ui
[10:40] SubStack: eh? I already do this all the right way in browserify
[10:40] SubStack: or you can use other modules if you want the commonjs way that sucks
[10:40] jetienne: SubStack: cool :)
[10:41] jetienne: SubStack: but if one try to implement this blocking version, despite perf, anything would make it impossible ?
[10:41] jetienne: like "is it possible to code it ?" and not "is it good/smart to code it" :)
[10:42] pascalopitz has left the channel
[10:44] SubStack: jetienne: well you can already do that with other modules
[10:44] pascalopitz has joined the channel
[10:44] jetienne: SubStack: so i guess it is possible :)
[10:45] Emmanuel__: YEAH \o/
[10:45] jetienne: a dropin replacement of require
[10:45] stagas: jetienne: not ideal, I wanted simple selectors within my node app, afaik phantom isn't a module
[10:45] Emmanuel__: after weeks on working on node.js, without prior knowledge on js
[10:45] SubStack: I just have no plans to implement synchronous xhr require because I don't want it.
[10:45] Emmanuel__: I managed to build a small yet working IRC-like server  \o/
[10:45] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[10:45] jetienne: stagas: ah yep, just another alternative. i have tried much phantomjs
[10:46] jetienne: SubStack: yep clearly async is more efficient
[10:46] Juan77 has joined the channel
[10:46] __tosh has joined the channel
[10:46] jetienne: oh another possibility would be to have node to support async require
[10:47] jetienne: ok after all that i will go the brequire route. https://github.com/weepy/brequire
[10:48] stagas: but brequire still needs you to preload everything with <script> prior to require()
[10:49] jetienne: stagas: yep, and to preprocess them. brequire is small, clean and nice but not perfect
[10:49] jetienne: in anycase a sync require in a browser can be said perfect either :)
[10:49] jetienne: canT
[10:50] stagas: so why not browserify, it bundles everything for you and no need to preprocess anything
[10:50] jetienne: stagas: nothing against it
[10:50] SubStack: jetienne: wait what
[10:51] SubStack: jetienne: browserify just bundles everything up into a single script
[10:51] SubStack: no xhr whatsoever
[10:51] jetienne: SubStack: commonjs got async loading too. but not supported by node for now
[10:51] SubStack: because that's silly
[10:51] jetienne: ah ok

[10:55] tmzt: getting count():  undefined
[10:55] tmzt: with dnode, putting together a gst
[10:56] SubStack: tmzt: dnode doesn't do replication
[10:56] EyePulp has joined the channel
[10:56] tmzt: what does that mean? I'm just calling the count() function not trying to use a getter
[10:56] SubStack: what does count() call?
[10:56] tmzt: return this._count
[10:57] SubStack: return values are ignored in dnode
[10:57] msch has joined the channel
[10:57] tmzt: I knew that
[10:57] SubStack: have to use continuation passing style

[11:01] kristsk has joined the channel
[11:02] SubStack: you can do this.UnreadClippings = { count : models.UnreadClippings.count.bind(models.UnreadClippings), ... }
[11:02] tmzt: well I'm getting the callback now but it's parameter is null
[11:02] tmzt: ok
[11:03] tmzt: or models.UnreadClippings.count = models.UnreadClippings.count.bind(models.UnreadClippings) ?
[11:04] tmzt: do that in app.js ?
[11:05] jpstrikesback has joined the channel
[11:06] tmzt: okay, that seems to work
[11:06] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[11:06] tmzt: but how do I make UnreadClippings an event emitter and subscribe to them from the client?
[11:08] sveimac has joined the channel
[11:08] SubStack: it seems to work best to create an EventEmitter on the client and then pass in the bound emitter's emit function to the server
[11:08] masahiroh has joined the channel
[11:15] Fullmoon has joined the channel
[11:19] SubStack: tmzt: that pubsub article I wrote goes over a good way that I found to do event emitters over dnode
[11:22] tmzt: well, I've got another problem, models.client is undefined
[11:23] tmzt: which leads me to think I should just add a queue to my model and do the xhr polling in express
[11:23] tmzt: because it seems that dnode isn't initializing quickly enough and I want the values synced as soon as it does, hmm
[11:24] tmzt: obviously synced manually as it doesn't do replication

[11:36] tanepiper: augustl: thought so :|
[11:36] augustl: tanepiper: in apache, you would most likely have a http server on port 80 and https on 443
[11:37] augustl: the "real" answer is that you can't connect to a TLS socket without a certificate
[11:37] tanepiper: yea, looks like i'll have to run two express servers, and have one just redirect to https
[11:38] augustl: you don't need to use express or any other wrapper to run a http server that redirects ;)

[13:06] Muon: SubStack: actually, it dies with an error in the error handler

[13:14] Muon: SubStack: how is Amazon's service working out for you?
[13:14] jpstrikesback: SubStack: out of curiousity…on b-ling why don't you use the real IE's for <9?
[13:14] SubStack: Muon: when it's not locking up entirely it's ok

[13:18] ziro` has joined the channel
[13:19] SubStack: tmzt: you can try var self = this
[13:19] tmzt: SubStack: the goal is to call either this.clientmodel.update(count) or this.clientupdate(count)
[13:19] Muon: SubStack: great effing service
[13:19] SubStack: tmzt: and then inside your functions use self instead of this
[13:19] Muon: SubStack: :P
[13:19] jpstrikesback: SubStack: huh, that's why, nice to know. I love b-ling… I can't (but will) wait for it to work a little better :)

[13:22] Muon: I think I just locked up the other one
[13:22] SubStack: jpstrikesback: no we ran a pilot server on rackspace for a while
[13:22] SubStack: it's just more expensive
[13:22] SubStack: and we only recently got some funding
[13:22] jpstrikesback: was it more reliable?

[13:26] lukegalea: SubStack: you mean micro instances?

[13:26] jpstrikesback: what would it take to make the free experience nice?
[13:26] SubStack: Muon: yeah IE9 is actually pretty good at rendering stuff
[13:26] jpstrikesback: aaaah
[13:27] SubStack: it's about where firefox was 4 or 5 years ago
[13:27] jpstrikesback: micro instances throttle so hardcore

[13:28] SubStack: but we're in the process of closing a funding round so things will start to get much better this month I expect
[13:28] lukegalea: jpstrikesback: I guess the question is, what runs more reliably? 4 micro instances behind an ELB?? Or 1 small instance?
[13:28] SubStack: pkrumins has hacked up some ec2 automation with the node lib for that
[13:29] SubStack: lukegalea: I don't actually know much about the ec2 stuff, pkrumins manages all of that
[13:29] Muon: what's the ETA on IE9?
[13:29] lukegalea: SubStack: cool. It was kinda a rhetorical questions anyway ;) 
[13:30] kenbolton has joined the channel
[13:30] jpstrikesback: lukegalea: 1 small I think, cause it doesn't throttle after a few seconds of high cpu

[17:17] Aikar: trotter: jetienne its linked on the node homepage for 3rd party modules
[17:17] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: you can still use it as long as it serializes to JSON, so req.session.foo = { bar: 'baz' } is fine

[18:46] tjholowaychuk: req.session is the Session and the data
[18:46] tjholowaychuk: its magical
[18:47] tmzt: .save() didn't seem to be defined

[18:59] paulrobinson has joined the channel
[18:59] lukegalea: Hi mape. I'm just looking at node-notifo. At first glance it doesn't look like it handles Service credentials, just user. Is that correct?
[18:59] mape: lukegalea: Yeah
[19:00] mape: I mostly use it for notifications to myself for server errors and the like
[19:00] lukegalea: I'm guessing it should be easy to add that functionality in, eh? I think I'll give that a go and send you a pull request if I pull it off.
[19:01] tmzt: it's a race
[19:01] tmzt: I'm queueing things to send which is calling .end which is overwritting the session

[19:22] JimBastard: isaacs: do you have a moment to look at an npm error log? i'm not entirely sure why this failed, trying to help out a noob http://fpaste.org/uFOE/
[19:22] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: it should grab 0.5.7 or something, connect 1.0.0 is for express 2.0 only (not released yet)
[19:22] JimBastard: the JSONloops install is still not working 100%
[19:22] isaacs: JimBastard: /usr/local/lib/node/.npm/irrklang/0.0.1/package/deps/irrKlang/bin/macosx-gcc/libirrklang.dylib: file not recognized: File format not recognized
[19:23] isaacs: collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
[19:23] tanepiper: tjholowaychuk: nahh, clean express still installs connect 1.0.0
[19:23] tjholowaychuk: tanepiper: it shouldnt :(
[19:23] JimBastard: isaacs: i dont really know what that error indicates
[19:23] isaacs: JimBastard: the node-waf build is failing
[19:23] JimBastard: ok
[19:23] isaacs: JimBastard: it means that that file is broken
[19:23] tanepiper: you need to manually npm install the express-2.0 pre, or manually install connect 0,5,7 and activate
[19:23] isaacs: JimBastard: the irrklang thing is failing to build
[19:23] JimBastard: ok
[19:23] JimBastard: where would i want to go trouble shoot that?
[19:24] isaacs: get the irrklang source code.  run `node-waf configure build`
[19:24] tjholowaychuk: tanepiper: damnit, I added the connect dep as something like ">= 0.5.0 < 1.0.0"
[19:24] tjholowaychuk: thought npm supported that
[19:24] JimBastard: okay, makes sense
[19:24] JimBastard: doing that now
[19:24] isaacs: maybe send an email to $(npm owner ls irrklang)
[19:24] jpstrikesback: ha I'm making lotsa stackoverflow cash on this express/connect mismatch :)
[19:24] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: it does
[19:24] tjholowaychuk: tanepiper: ^ should work then
[19:25] JimBastard: Shrink: can you try installing https://github.com/tmpvar/node-irrklang as a stand-alone ?
[19:25] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: but express does require() after the first tick, which is flaky before 0.3
[19:25] JimBastard: Shrink: and run build from the instructions there
[19:25] Shrink: JimBastard, http://fpaste.org/2eh4/
[19:25] Shrink: is what I get with npm install irrklang
[19:25] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: it requires connect the first tick
[19:25] isaacs: Shrink: what os is this?
[19:25] JimBastard: # /usr/local/lib/node/.npm/irrklang/0.0.1/package/deps/irrKlang/bin/macosx-gcc/libirrklang.dylib: file not recognized: File format not recognized # collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
[19:25] JimBastard: same thing
[19:25] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: oh, ok

[19:25] JimBastard: ohhh heh
[19:25] isaacs: and fedora 14 is not macosx
[19:26] JimBastard: i bet its hard-coded
[19:26] tjholowaychuk: tanepiper: works for me, i get connect 0.5.10
[19:26] JimBastard: !
[19:26] Shrink: JimBastard, I'll do that

[19:27] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: ah thought so, just wanted to be safe haha
[19:27] tanepiper: but nvm, i've moved to express 2.0-pre anyway
[19:27] JimBastard: Shrink: isaacs https://github.com/tmpvar/node-irrklang/blob/master/wscript#L34
[19:27] JimBastard: thats it!
[19:27] JimBastard: hard coded!
[19:27] mape: best module for couchdb?
[19:28] JimBastard: im not entirely sure how you are suppose to un-hardcode that, i fail at build
[19:28] JimBastard: and life
[19:28] stagas: mape: cradle is kinda nice
[19:28] Shrink: JimBastard, So what do i Do?
[19:28] isaacs: JimBastard: python has some OS things
[19:28] isaacs: JimBastard: you can see where you're at.
[19:29] JimBastard: isaacs: sample code anywhere?
[19:29] isaacs: i think maybe even something like bld.platform or something
[19:29] isaacs: node's wscript is very informative.
[19:29] JimBastard: Shrink: that line i linked you, is hard-coded to the macos path, we need to change that for the linux path
[19:29] isaacs: lots of examples, since it does a bunch of stuff.
[19:30] Shrink: JimBastard, hell
[19:30] JimBastard: Shrink: lets see if we can figure out what string goes in there, should be easy
[19:30] mape: JimBastard: thanks
[19:30] JimBastard: then ill get tmpvar to look at the wscript later and we'll update it proper
[19:30] JimBastard: mape: ?

[19:39] tmzt: still 0.5.10
[19:39] tmzt: just did npm update
[19:40] isaacs: tmzt: what's the issue?
[19:40] tmzt: isaacs: installing connect installs 1.0.1, but installing express switches it back to 0.5.10
[19:40] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: that is correct
[19:40] tjholowaychuk: i thought you meant it was NOT installing 0.5.10
[19:40] eyesUnclouded has joined the channel
[19:41] tjholowaychuk: express 1.0.8 only supports 0.5.10, connect 1.0 is for the upcoming express 2.0
[19:41] tjholowaychuk: and supports node 0.4.x only
[19:41] andrewfff has joined the channel
[19:42] zzak: wait, express 1.0.8 supports node 0.4.x?
[19:42] tjholowaychuk: no
[19:42] tjholowaychuk: lol
[19:42] tmzt: okay, so what did you mean by upgrade to 1.0.1 to get req.session.save() working?
[19:42] zzak: haha
[19:42] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: I thought you were working with 2.0.0-pre
[19:42] tmzt: I can, I'm on node 0.4
[19:43] tmzt: install that from git?
[19:44] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: have to right now, isaac added a way for me to expose 2.0.0-pre but I havent tried it yet
[19:44] tmzt: then install connect from git as well? is there a newer connect-redis because I have that as a standalone file
[19:45] Bloudermilk has joined the channel
[19:45] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: yup connect-redis 1.0.0

[19:58] mikegerwitz: Oh, excuse me
[19:58] mikegerwitz: http may not.
[19:58] mikegerwitz: Bloudermilk: Looks like it's just JS. Someone else please correct me if I'm wrong. Was thinking of the wrong file :)

[20:07] fmarceau: haha I like that
[20:07] fmarceau: we are using a lot of JS (yui3) for the front-end here
[20:07] fmarceau: and I would like to get rid of php eventually
[20:08] fmarceau: in order to have an end-to-end JS code
[20:09] ncb000gt: fmarceau: sure
[20:09] ncb000gt: i'm trying to figure out what you're looking for, maturity level is fairly ambiguous
[20:09] EyePulp: fmarceau: node itself seems pretty stable, but things feel pretty fluid when it comes to web frameworks on top of node.  definitely less maturity/docs/contributors that you'll find in the php/ruby/python world.

[20:14] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: { locals: {} } is now just {}, so res.render(path, { foo: 'bar' }) etc

[20:28] FND: (ideally, something that focuses on "web frameworks" - my long-term goal is to convince colleagues to ditch Rails)

[20:35] Horofox: So if i get a book and get good into syntax, the way it deals with objects and stuff... would it be a good investment of time?
[20:36] ncb000gt: Horofox: the really big hurdle for most seems to be the asynchronous piece
[20:36] ncb000gt: but if you're used to events with front end libraries, then you should be fine

[21:15] mjr_: tjholowaychuk: is your connect-redis still working well with recent versions of node_redis?  I added a couple of things recently.
[21:15] tjholowaychuk: mjr_: hmm i think so, havent tried in the last little bit
[21:15] tjholowaychuk: or i might have locked it to a specific version
[21:16] mjr_: Probably best to lock yours to a specific version
[21:16] tjholowaychuk: ah nope i have >= 0.0.1
[21:16] tjholowaychuk: what did you change?
[21:16] mjr_: So you don't get surprised
[21:16] tjholowaychuk: will keep that in mind :)
[21:16] mjr_: A pretty serious bug with new redis servers on startup
[21:16] mjr_: While Redis is loading the database, it'll accept connections, but then send back errors for everything
[21:16] mjr_: EVERYTHING
[21:16] tjholowaychuk: oh shit haha
[21:16] mjr_: Except info
[21:17] mjr_: Info will tell you that it is loading the database
[21:17] mjr_: So now, on all new connections, I first send an info command to see if the db is ready for real commands
[21:17] maushu has joined the channel
[21:17] mjr_: And I don't emit "connected" until that check passes.
[21:17] mjr_: Should be fine for most things.
[21:18] mjr_: But if your redis server requires auth, like the Redis To Go service does, then it gets trickier
[21:18] mjr_: Because you need to auth before you can info
[21:18] maushu: I'm using socket.io, it makes me twitch.
[21:19] mavin has joined the channel
[21:19] mjr_: So I made it remember auth, and that command will jump in front of any other commands, and be re-sent on any reconnect.

[21:44] kkaefer: brianc: hey
[21:44] brianc: kkaefer: I think so, yeah...I'm pretty happy with the prepared statement api
[21:44] brianc: kkaefer: got suggestions?
[21:45] kkaefer: oh, I was referring to https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki/Query
[21:45] brianc: kkaefer: yeah I need to document that
[21:46] kkaefer: maybe you can help me; I'm trying to do batch inserts
[21:46] kkaefer: and it's pretty slow :/
[21:46] brianc: kkaefer: basically when you send in parameters to a query it uses the 'prepared statement' internally. 
[21:46] kkaefer: it's already wrapped in a translation
[21:46] brianc: kkaefer: what operating system & version of postgres are you running?
[21:46] kkaefer: 9.0.3 and 10.6
[21:46] brianc: 9.0.0 what?

[21:47] kkaefer: postgres 9.0.3
[21:47] gizmomogwai1 has left the channel
[21:47] brianc: okay. how slow is it going for you?
[21:47] kkaefer: about 10 seconds for 20k rows
[21:47] kkaefer: wrapped in a transaction
[21:47] brianc: 20k inserts in a transaction?
[21:47] kkaefer: yeah?
[21:48] brianc: I'm not sure I'd consider that 'slow' really, but do you get way better performance using a different library?
[21:48] brianc: like with php or ruby or c or anything?
[21:48] kkaefer: I didn't try that
[21:49] kkaefer: but COPY FROM is less than a second
[21:49] brianc: do you have node-postgres cloned?
[21:49] kkaefer: no
[21:49] brianc: yeah the COPY api is way way faster
[21:49] augustl: JimBastard: can't find it in the fs docs :S
[21:49] brianc: I haven't implemented the COPY stuff yet. :/
[21:49] augustl: wohey, "readdir". Was looking for "list"
[21:49] kkaefer: brianc: well, I'm just executing that as a plain query
[21:50] kkaefer: anyway, so you're saying 10 seconds for 20k rows is not slow?
[21:50] brianc: yeah, as a plain query you're going to be doing 20k inserts 1 at a time with a full request/response to the postgres server. with COPY FROM you pipe data directly in. 
[21:50] kkaefer: yeah
[21:50] JimBastard: augustl: https://github.com/substack/node-findit
[21:50] kkaefer: hm, I've managed 100k inserts in < 1 second with sqlite
[21:52] eee_c has joined the channel
[21:52] brianc: kkaefer: the tricky thing is it depends on a lot of factors other than just node, or node-postgres. could be the table structure you're inserting into, indexs, the way postgres is configured, or, it could be node-postgres
[21:52] brianc: kkaefer: I think it takes about .4 milliseconds to do a select query on a small table when I tested it on my mac
[21:53] kkaefer: yeah, I'm not worried about select performance
[21:54] brianc: if you're always going to be doing 20,000 inserts at once, COPY FROM is the way to go
[21:54] kkaefer: I'm using that to do the initial import
[21:54] kkaefer: what I'm doing now is retrieve the data, then manipulate it and write it in a different table
[21:54] kkaefer: and I'm wondering if I can get faster doing that with node than directly in psql
[21:55] kkaefer: since the code is splitting up strings with regular expressions
[21:55] kkaefer: which apparently isn't very fast in postgres
[21:55] kkaefer: so I'm doing it in node, which is only a fraction of the time postgres needs
[21:55] kkaefer: but the problem is getting the new data back into the db
[21:55] jakehow has joined the channel
[21:56] brianc: kkaefer: yeah, I'm reading this now: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2927017/slow-insert-speed-in-postgresql-memory-tablespace
[21:56] brianc: try committing the transaction every 1k or so rows
[21:57] brianc: kkaefer: can also used a 'named' query which will cache the execution plan after the first run
[21:58] brianc: search this for "named prepared statement reuse" https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki/Client
[21:59] kkaefer: found it
[21:59] kkaefer: thanks, trying that
[21:59] brianc: kkaefer: I've also done some _very_ initial benchmarks on node-postgres using pure JS versus the libpq bindings I'm working on within node-postgres, and the pure JS doesn't seem much slower so far, though I'll know much more in a week or two

[22:34] tmzt: didn't copy the text for shaver maybe it was an artifact
[22:34] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: you might be catching master at weird shas
[22:34] tjholowaychuk: its not garanteed to be stable or anything

[22:35] tmzt: understand, the api changes are for 2.0 though?
[22:35] tjholowaychuk: yup
[22:35] ncb000gt: tanepiper: why do you ask?
[22:36] bwlang: i have a file containing some javascript with a namespace... i'd like to execute some methods in there, do i need to convert it to a commonjs module?
[22:36] bradleymeck: ACTION ponders a postscript to node-canvas bridge
[22:37] eb4890 has joined the channel
[22:37] maushu: bwinton, huh
[22:37] maushu: exports?
[22:37] bradleymeck: bwlang, export it w/ the exports object and since you namespaced it just for(var k in namespace) exports[k] = namespace[k]
[22:37] kkaefer: brianc: I quickly implemented it in php and it's only half the time there
[22:37] tanepiper: ncb000gt: looking at how to do our structure - basically looking to seperate out the client from the server, so the client itself is it's own server - serves up static content and take requests from the browser client
[22:37] maushu: I remember a way to turn a namespace into exports... I think.
[22:38] tanepiper: then use dnode to pass them to available machines that do that task
[22:38] tanepiper: so for example have a CouchDB server, or a report generator server - but they should be able to fire up and handshake the client server to say it's available
[22:39] ncb000gt: tanepiper: i see, what we're looking at is the monitoring side of things
[22:39] kkaefer: brianc: actually, it's more like 15.5s vs. 3.5s
[22:39] ncb000gt: as in, server is down, mem hit x, cpu load is y, and that sort of thing (those are just examples though)
[22:39] ncb000gt: tanepiper: yea
[22:40] tmzt: tjholowaychuk: new errorr :) Error: Can't use mutable header APIs after sent.
[22:40] ncb000gt: we're using xmpp to do that notification
[22:40] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: what's your code?
[22:40] samcday: Hey all, anyone know the best way to pass a proper Buffer back from a C++ extension? 
[22:41] samcday: That is, I want to instantiate a proper Buffer (not a SlowBuffer) from a C++ addon and give it back to JS
[22:41] ncb000gt: samcday: return the buffer handle
[22:41] ncb000gt: buf->handle_
[22:41] tmzt: tjholowaychuk: nothing special, nothing touching headers
[22:41] trentm has joined the channel
[22:41] samcday: That's a SlowBuffer.
[22:42] dyer_ has joined the channel
[22:42] jimt_ has joined the channel
[22:42] samcday: The proper JS buffer wraps a SlowBuffer so slices etc are much faster
[22:42] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: well a res.send() or what?
[22:42] samcday: assert.instanceOf(myObjFromC.data, Buffer); is failing.
[22:42] tjholowaychuk: something i can use to reproduce
[22:42] tmzt: res.render
[22:42] ncb000gt: samcday: hmm
[22:43] KRBssa has joined the channel
[22:43] tmzt: I'll gist the error
[22:43] tjholowaychuk: k
[22:43] samcday: I'm thinking I need to grab a handle to the global context from V8, then get the Buffer FunctionTemplate from there
[22:43] bwlang has left the channel
[22:43] samcday: Just not 100% on how I go about that ;D
[22:43] tmzt: https://gist.github.com/851925
[22:44] tmzt: I wouldn't need to upgrade jade too would I?
[22:44] ncb000gt: samcday: not sure, i'm still in the process of converting merlin over to the 0.4.x conventions
[22:45] ncb000gt: that said, i need to head out, bbl
[22:45] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: nah jade should be fine if you have a somewhat recent version, can you gist that chunk of code though?
[22:46] tjholowaychuk: i have TONS of res.render()s that pass in my tests
[22:46] tjholowaychuk: something called writeHead() first

[22:46] piscisaureu_ has joined the channel
[22:47] tmzt: tjholowaychuk: yeah, but it's probably more involved then that
[22:48] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: make sure you are not res.send() res.send() or something, ive seen people call it multiple times
[22:48] tjholowaychuk: might be some funky bug in res.render() but it should be exposed with my 100s of tests
[22:50] tmzt: it might be that, I only use res.end on an error message, these are all regressions though to pre 1.0 unless it's intended behavior
[22:50] tmzt: https://gist.github.com/851925
[22:50] tmzt: same, I just updated it
[22:51] tmzt: same url I mean

[22:51] tmzt: this is 560
[22:51] tmzt: 					res.render('public/'+p, options);									
[22:52] tmzt: so it's not the .writeHead, end at the bottom
[22:52] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: res.writeHead(404, 'User not found')
[22:52] tjholowaychuk: you cant pass a string to that method
[22:52] tjholowaychuk: that is supposed to be header fields
[22:53] tjholowaychuk: res.writeHead(status, { k: v })
[22:53] tmzt: okay, I was just trying to set the http text status
[22:53] tmzt: you can just res.send(404) then?
[22:54] tjholowaychuk: yup

[23:53] tjholowaychuk: this matrix of npm / express / connect / node versions is realllly fucking people up haha
[23:53] Sebmaster: yea, i guess its that connect / express incopatibility or smth
[23:54] Sebmaster: so i just commented it out
[23:54] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: yeah, it's tricky
[23:54] Sebmaster: i can wait
[23:54] isaacs: you know, you can set a max npm version in the "engines" hash?
[23:55] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: i have express 1.0.8 locked to node 0.2.x now, should help people out but seems to still be having issues haha
[23:55] tjholowaychuk: gahh
[23:55] jpstrikesback: weird thing is I had it working and then it just seemed to stop…I must have updated something but I am reverting everything and no go
[23:56] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: hm... will that just make them get 1.0.7 instead?
[23:56] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: ah, shit, yeah probably
[23:56] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: you might want to unpublish (or republish with -f) anything that isn't locked to a specific node version
[23:56] tjholowaychuk: fuck
[23:56] tjholowaychuk: haha
[23:57] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: also, isn't there a 2.0 or something that's for node 0.4.x?

[23:58] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: might be cookie related then

[23:59] tmzt: otherwise nothing has changed, same browser, same client js
[23:59] jpstrikesback: tmzt: I hadn't started tracking it down yet but that is exactly what i suspected cause my 302s happen after checks for session…except I'm using connect-mongodb
