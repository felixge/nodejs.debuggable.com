[01:02] Tobsn: i dont see the benefits either way ;)
[01:03] tjholowaychuk: deedubs that might help, it's not even remotely finished and the output only looks good when you have a single request via curl etc but looks nasty with assets etc
[01:03] Tobsn: of coffeescript
[01:04] deedubs: tjholowaychuk: ahh so that'll show me how a request traverses express.  Problem is I don't know if the nested route is being set properly and don't know the url to hit :D

[02:02] SubStack: niftylettuce: I'm not sure why you'd want to do that
[02:02] jesusabdullah: niftylettuce: I haven't had a chance to try browserify yet.
[02:02] niftylettuce: SubStack: in HTML5 boilerplate, you include modernizr and respond at the top, and then the rest of the JS like jquery etc. at the bottom  below </body>
[02:02] SubStack: niftylettuce: just use http redirects
[02:03] niftylettuce: SubStack: what do u mean?
[02:03] SubStack: niftylettuce: not sure what that is
[02:03] heavysixer has joined the channel
[02:03] SubStack: browserify generates one file. That's not going to change any time soon

[02:05] gavin_huang has joined the channel
[02:06] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: ideally you could just pass "skip preamble"  to bundle
[02:07] bad_at_math has joined the channel
[02:07] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: this way you could use the publicly supported bundle interface multiple times.  additionally, you'd probably want to have a "preample" function that would return the string of just the shim and require definition stuff.
[02:07] isaacs has joined the channel
[02:07] aaronblohowiak: this wouldn't avoid duplication in the strings that bundle() calls produce but it would let you have some finer-grained control of the output

[02:09] niftylettuce: so basically a check if var is true or false and if its true then dont include preamble
[02:09] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: right now, using browserify to share *application code* is really tricky.
[02:10] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: it would basically be putting this in an if(){} block: https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/blob/master/index.js#L57-60
[02:10] SubStack: aaronblohowiak: what is tricky about it?
[02:11] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: I'd have to create package.json files for my application code
[02:11] SubStack: wha?
[02:12] mikeal has joined the channel
[02:12] SubStack: you can just browserify.bundle(__dirname + '/code'), no package.jsons required
[02:12] SubStack: or likewise with browserify() if you want a middleware
[02:12] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: that only works if i *just* want the code in one directory
[02:13] galaxywatcher has joined the channel
[02:13] SubStack: well it's a recursive traversal
[02:13] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: no multiple root directories
[02:13] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: also, sometimes i want a dependency to vary between server and client contexts.. like data_store.js =)
[02:13] SubStack: ah well you can use base : { foo : 'somedir', bar : 'someotherdir' } now
[02:13] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: i know this might be out of scope of browserify
[02:14] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: yes, which is why i thanked you so hard =)
[02:14] SubStack: it also supports node_modules
[02:14] colinsullivan has joined the channel

[03:30] Emmanuel: anybody knows a convenient way to load javascript in the fly with Node ? Say you have a running node server (that you don't want to stop), according to a request, the server should load some external JS
[03:30] Emmanuel: (so, without restarting the server, we can change it's behaviour)
[03:30] Aria: Read and eval? use the Script object?
[03:31] Emmanuel: I'll take a look at that
[03:31] Emmanuel: (the Script object)
[03:31] Emmanuel: hm. What do you mean by script object actually :)
[03:31] Dinosaurus: is it possible to use sessions in a mongoid scope
[03:31] Dinosaurus: like scope :mine, where(user_id: session[:user][:_id])
[03:32] chjj: Emmanuel, what are you trying to do exactly?
[03:32] Emmanuel: we have a product with basic features
[03:32] superjudge has joined the channel
[03:32] Emmanuel: and we want to extend it "on the fly", without restarting the server
[03:33] Emmanuel: that means typically adding some new JS script and ask the server to load them depending on the request
[03:33] Emmanuel: say, if client requires page X, we load the associated script for page X, that tells the server how to process it
[03:33] Dinosaurus: write everything in assembly and maintain your stack by hand
[03:33] chjj: Emmanuel: it sounds like you might be going about things the wrong way
[03:33] Emmanuel: maybe read and eval is good enough actually
[03:34] vikstrous: Emmanuel: what's the problem with just using requre?
[03:34] Dinosaurus has left the channel
[03:34] Emmanuel: require should do it too
[03:34] chjj: why not have everything loaded in a module to begin with?
[03:34] Emmanuel: (that's a new idea, I'm thinking it out, asking for suggestion)
[03:35] vikstrous: Emmanuel: chjj is right... there's rarely any point of loading only a part of the application
[03:35] vikstrous: maybe if you had different servers that had different purposes and you wanted them to only load what's necessary for their job... but then you might as well have different apps
[03:36] Emmanuel: the app is a proxy server
[03:36] Emmanuel: a user get the page through the server, the server make some change (or provide a brand newly generated page)
[03:36] Emmanuel: and we want to be able to add more features in the feature
[03:36] Emmanuel: future *
[03:37] Emmanuel: like, we have that specific case that require the page to be process in a new way, we didn't expected before
[03:37] Emmanuel: so we had the associated script for that
[03:37] Emmanuel: but maybe just require'ing the associated script according to the request should do it
[03:38] vikstrous: hmm... so you have some kind of a node app hosting platform and don't want to restart the server when you make modifications to the apps hosted?
[03:40] dguttman has joined the channel
[03:40] justinTNT: Emmanuel : I've got some ideas about how you should do that.
[03:41] Emmanuel: vikstrous: yes
[03:41] justinTNT: I reckon for the kind of functionality you're describing, the way to go ahead is to setup a handler on a config port.
[03:41] Emmanuel: because we /know/ we will have more features, or more exceptions, or more hacky stuff to add in the future
[03:41] justinTNT: listen on that config port for connections from a utility, that sends various runtime config commands and settings to the main app.
[03:41] Emmanuel: we just can't think of everything ahead
[03:41] justinTNT: including one to load new modules from a preconfigured path.

[04:22] jmoyers: its good for data heavy real-time stuff

[04:48] alcuadrado: afaik
[04:48] mscdex: right
[04:48] mscdex: well, you can get the list of network adapters on the machine from node and their addresses and if they are internal or not
[04:48] mscdex: maybe you can just parse that list for internal addresses and then just compare them on connection
[04:49] mscdex: oh wait, nevermind that's only available in the master branch
[04:49] mscdex: sorry ><
[04:49] alcuadrado: I think making a generic ipv6 compare algorithm would be more useful
[04:49] alcuadrado: oh :( haha
[04:49] alcuadrado: I'm with 4.7
[04:50] mscdex: it'll be in 0.6 though! ;)
[04:50] alcuadrado: v0.5.0-pre sorry
[04:50] mscdex: oh
[04:50] alcuadrado: strange, I thought I was in 4.7 :s
[04:50] mscdex: if you're on v0.5.0-pre then you may have that capability
[04:52] mscdex: alcuadrado: see here: https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/doc/api/os.markdown
[04:52] alcuadrado: but 0.4.7 on the server :p
[04:52] mscdex: ah ok
[04:52] alcuadrado: I'd have to learn about the alternative ways to write ipv6 ips and make a generic algorithm
[04:52] alcuadrado: that would be cool :)
[04:53] alcuadrado: it's a shame my deadline is.. tomorrow haha
[04:53] mscdex: i don't think you can really write an algorithm
[04:54] mscdex: because you can multiple ipv6 loopback addresses
[04:54] mscdex: s/can/can have/
[04:55] mscdex: i think so anyway...

[05:06] vikstrous: guys i'm writing a module and in this module there's a function which is asynch and it can have optional parameters... so i need to decide what order i should put the parameters in. should i put the callback first? i've always seen the callback being last but i need space for my optional parameters... maybe i should pass all parameters as a single object?
[05:06] amaudy has joined the channel
[05:06] mischief has joined the channel
[05:07] jmoyers: options hash, callback last imo
[05:07] SubStack: vikstrous: var args = [].slice.call(arguments)
[05:07] SubStack: var cb = args.slice(-1)[0]
[05:07] SubStack: or even:
[05:08] SubStack: var cb = args.filter(function (arg) { return typeof arg === 'function' })[0]
[05:08] SubStack: any order
[05:08] vikstrous: so having both optional arguments and callback last is good?
[05:08] flippyhead has joined the channel
[05:08] jmoyers: Sub's method allows you to have any number of optional parameters.
[05:09] vikstrous: yeah i just wasn't sure if that's a good way of doing it or something that people would expect
[05:09] jmoyers: lots of modules have variable method signatures
[05:09] jmoyers: i like the options hash because you can use _.defaults to populate it
[05:09] SubStack: vikstrous: you can get pretty fancy https://github.com/substack/dnode-protocol/blob/master/index.js#L221-L264
[05:09] jmoyers: rather than doing a bunch of arguments object slicing
[05:10] jmoyers: also SubStack, do you know if accessing arguments is 'slow'? I overheard something of the sort
[05:10] temp01 has joined the channel
[05:11] vikstrous: i think i'll go with the object with parameters in any case because it's easier to read what's what... better than having like 3 parameters +3 optional ones
[05:11] SubStack: jmoyers: I don't listen to those people.
[05:11] SubStack: optimize the pieces that are measurably slow and only after you've written it the nice way first
[05:12] dguttman has joined the channel

[05:46] fbzhong: how to set window as global scope in the new context?
[05:46] fbzhong: I think the sandbox.__proto__ = window, the sandbox is global scope, the window is included as well.

[06:02] indutny: fbzhong: why are you using Context bindings?
[06:02] indutny: fbzhong: why not just a regular object

[07:38] fbzhong: indutny: there is someone reply this issue on github. He said the __proto__ property does not copy proper in runInNewContext code.  https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/1105#issuecomment-1233739
[07:38] indutny: fbzhong: great
[07:38] indutny: fbzhong: as I said
[07:38] indutny: fbzhong: so does my workaround with constructor.prototype works?
[07:39] fbzhong: indutny: and he said that the getter/setter property does not copied either. Later I will write some code to test it.
[07:39] indutny: k
[07:39] fbzhong: indutny: sorry that I didn't test it yet... :(

[07:44] igl has joined the channel
[07:44] indutny: fbzhong: constructor and __proto__ ain't in properties list
[07:45] fbzhong: indutny: so you means the sandbox->GetPropertyNames will return all keys without the __proto__ and setter/getter propery, right?
[07:45] indutny: yep
[07:45] jhurliman: does anyone else have issues with the line numbers in node-inspector drifting (becoming incorrect) while stepping through many methods?
[07:46] indutny: V8EXPORT Local<Array> v8::Object::GetPropertyNames( ) Returns an array containing the names of the enumerable properties of this object, including properties from prototype objects.

[16:26] context: socket is the listening socket. it has no remote ip
[16:26] Tobsn: im not sure about the scope and session data here... is connection triggered by each remote connection so each client obj is specific to its connection?
[16:26] FireFly|n900 has joined the channel
[16:26] jmoyers: yes
[16:27] context: tobsn: each connection is its own socket.
[16:27] eliziario has joined the channel
[16:27] Tobsn: k so socket.on('connection',func(client){}) the client is always unique to its socket at the moment handled

[16:28] xsyn has joined the channel

[16:29] context: listening socket has no 'other end'
[16:29] Tobsn: its what client holds

[16:30] Tobsn: k
[16:30] context: oh no wait
[16:30] Tobsn: hehe
[16:30] context: are you getting connections or connecting to something
[16:30] context: there is no 'connect' event on net.Server
[16:31] jmoyers: this is socket.io
[16:31] context: tobsn: is this coming from createServer or createConnection
[16:31] context: oh.
[16:31] jmoyers: presumably
[16:31] jmoyers: looking at the syntax
[16:31] Tobsn: its server side, socket = io.listen(); socket.on('connection', function( client ) { client.on( 'message', function(msg){ console.log(client); })} )

[16:39] Tobsn: that was easy
[16:39] drudge: there is also client.sessionId which maps to server.clients[sessionId]
[16:39] Tobsn: would be socket.clients right?
[16:39] context: tobsn: you want client.connection
[16:39] context: not listener
[16:39] Tobsn: if you initiate with socket = io.listen
[16:40] Tobsn: k

[16:41] context: but if you're just needing to send, what they said
[16:41] Tobsn: btw. does anyone use socket.io-cluster?

[17:27] orospakr: aside from the "main" field, how does npm set up require() paths for the contents of a given package? what do I do if I want to require() some specific module inside a package I depend on?
[17:27] tjholowaychuk: TheJH in v8
[17:27] context: in trunk/tools
[17:28] TheJH: tjholowaychuk, context, thank you
[17:28] context: orospakr: then you require('package').Module ?
[17:28] orospakr: context, assume for the moment that "main" is not set in that package's package.json.
[17:29] orospakr: (I tried that, and it require() complained that the package could not be found)
[17:29] andycc_ has joined the channel
[17:29] orospakr: (well, module could not be found.)
[17:30] context: is it installed ?
[17:30] context: what package.
[17:30] `3rdEden has joined the channel
[17:30] orospakr: context, should be.  `npm install persistencejs` in the cwd, ran node as  REPL and attempted to require().
[17:31] orospakr: that particular package's doc says you can load it with: "var persistence = require('persistencejs/persistence').persistence;"
[17:31] orospakr: however, that fails for me.
[17:31] orospakr: It's worth noting that other packages in ~/node_modules load fine.
[17:31] lukstr: TheJH: isn't it a shell script?

[17:33] context: orospakr: msg the dude and tell him to fix his crap
[17:33] context: or just require("persistencejs")
[17:33] orospakr: persistencejs does not have a main: in its package.json, so it looks like that require() relies on some implicit path behaviour (perhaps NPM sets node_modules as part of the node.js library path?)
[17:33] orospakr: neither works.
[17:33] context: orospakr: that package is showing usage of node 0.2.0
[17:33] orospakr: although, I'm going to try something...
[17:33] orospakr: context, ah, yeah.

[17:35] orospakr: drudge, is current lore suggesting that one as a good option? part of the problem is that there are TONS of libraries out there, and clear winners haven't really shaken out yet, afaik.
[17:35] orospakr: context, yeah, that's pretty much my feeling on that one now.
[17:35] killfill has joined the channel
[17:35] drudge: orospakr: i think its one of the better ones
[17:36] drudge: orospakr: depends on what database you are targeting
[17:36] orospakr: not even sure if I want to use a rdbms or a nosql, but I'm leaning towards rdbms.
[17:36] orospakr: if I use an rdbms, I very much prefer postgres.
[17:37] lukstr: node-orm does postrgres
[17:37] orospakr: Draggor, lukstr, it's readme looks a little... spartan.  probably why I passed over it already.

But it seems like npm doesnt know where they are. If i do "npm ls", it just says "/Users/cb (empty)", and if i try to require some module in node environment, it cant find it. Do i have to do something special something to let npm know where it installs stuff to?

[20:46] baudehlo: well I have a reason...
[20:46] Cheery: this thing is majorly advertised with server twist, but does it support filesystem access or C-bindings?
[20:46] baudehlo: is that most load testing tools use threads themselves, so don't scale up to tens of thousands of connections well.
[20:46] Cheery: (foreign function interfaces)
[20:46] Cheery: opengl?

[20:47] freakazoid: hey there jhurliman 
[20:47] freakazoid: you must be following me

[20:47] jhurliman: freakazoid, other way around i'm afraid! :p
[20:47] mjr_: using multiple processes with cluster or something
[20:47] freakazoid: haha
[20:47] devaholic: freakazoid: ive talked about it a lot but i dont know of any work done
[20:47] freakazoid: well we clearly have similar interests
[20:48] mjr_: Except you'll quickly run into the fact that node's http client/agent is still pretty slow in a lot of cases.
[20:48] pandeiro: mjr_: compared to what, just out of curiosity?
[20:48] freakazoid: I'm just trying to avoid having a user have to install anything else except the browser extension - mostly I'm interested in the browser as a container without requiring some internet-based resource to do the privileged stuff
[20:48] jhurliman: freakazoid, i haven't heard of such an extension. what specific parts are you looking for?
[20:48] devaholic: freakazoid: did you see JSlinux?
[20:48] baudehlo: mjr_: yeah quite possibly. I was hoping to find one using libev or libevent, but couldn't find one.
[20:49] baudehlo: actually I think I did find one. But couldn't get it to work.
[20:49] freakazoid: devaholic: I've seen it but it's still stuck inside JS's security model
[20:49] freakazoid: jhurliman: mostly I'm interested in the ability to use UDP to arbitrary locations so I can do in-browser p2p
[20:49] mjr_: pandeiro: well, a single node process as a client can't seem to load up a single node process as a server.  I find it takes 2-3 client processes for every server.
[20:49] jhurliman: ahh got it

[20:50] devaholic: freakazoid: yea i had come up with very similar ideas
[20:50] devaholic: not sure on the implementation
[20:51] freakazoid: I've heard of people using flash for something along these lines

[20:52] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[20:52] freakazoid: you'd still need a set of bootstrap IPs for first-time users
[20:53] freakazoid: another option for bootsrapping would be XMPP, but I don't think XMPP has enough penetration to assume the user already has an account, and if you have to run your own XMPP server then you might as well just use a web server for bootstrap
[20:53] freakazoid: I'm not quite as concerned about bootstrap though because that's the easy part

[21:57] EyePulp: pixel13: I'm not famaliar with node-static - but if it's bound to your server instance, and your server is bound to something other than localhost, then node-static probably is unaware of or doesn't need to handle host/port issues

[22:10] context: level09_: thats how npm 1.0 works.
[22:10] level09_: I mean it seems like it creates a node_modules dir within the same dir

[22:14] context: cheery: use sqlite for embedded applications and development if you want. 
[22:14] jonaslund: Cheery: If you hail NoSQL and think Sqlite has anything to do with salvation you need to get some things straight
[22:14] CoverSlide: sqlite is good and quick way to get up and running for small applications
[22:15] Cheery: EyePulp: like postgresql, but it's complex to configure and I've never liked the idea of generating SQL statements to make database access.

[22:19] justinw312: Anyone socket.io experts online? When my client reconnects, it fires both connecting and reconnecting events. When it reconnects, it fires both connect and reconnect. 
[22:19] justinw312: This doesn't seem like the intended behavior
[22:19] kkaefer: CoverSlide: I saw someone writing a "native js" implementatin by creating a child process of the sqlite3 client binary and reading its stdout/stdin
[22:19] secoif has joined the channel
[22:20] justinw312: So I end up having to test if(socket.reconnecting) in my functions. 
[22:21] Cheery: I just wonder which database systems there are though. You can argue with each other about how sqlX is better than sqlY.
[22:21] Cheery: need to look into it myself. bah.
[22:21] CoverSlide: by the way, when the windows port is complete, does anyone have any idea how native modules will be compiled?
[22:22] Cheery: never had anything really huge so maybe looking for those is waste of time.
[22:22] CoverSlide: would they need mingw in their toolchain?
[22:22] EyePulp: Cheery: for real world use of reasonable complexity and speed, there are viable options in both the SQL and noSQL world.  Anyone who claims otherwise is probably not a very good advisor.
[22:22] Cheery: most ppl can go with sql even if it was layered into twenty 'helper' layers.

[22:23] fakewaffle: is there a good tutorial on setting up the chrome debugger with node?
[22:23] context: err kind of
[22:24] context: it looks like reconnect might lamost fire before actually connecting
[22:24] Cheery: EyePulp: for me the speed is just one useful property, but real thing I want is multi-process access, okayish API and atomicity of some chain of operations so they don't mess the whole system when they fail.
[22:24] justinw312: context: So if I have to test socket.reconnecting inside of my connecting function, and branch accordingly, why even have a reconnecting event? 
[22:24] CoverSlide: on the one hand, I agree that generating human code (SQL) as an intermediary to connect to another computer-run application (SQL Database) doesn't make the most sense, but I think that the NoSQL way isn't exactly the best route either
[22:24] context: cheery: then use a real server and stop complaining.
[22:24] justinw312: context: Thank you for the info though
[22:24] EyePulp: heh
[22:25] Cheery: where do I get such real server?

[22:25] jonaslund: CoverSlide: compiling on windows isn't set in stone yet
[22:26] Cheery: they're cool because it's relatively cheap and maintenance easy to go on with them.
[22:26] context: i imagine most of htem came with mysql or postgresqm. pick one. there are a few dozen sql and nosql options for you
[22:26] context: depending on what you are doing
[22:26] jonaslund: CoverSlide: I know there's been work towards porting to MSVC aswell as running on Mingw (mingw works with later 4.x atleast)
[22:26] justinw312: I can't seem to get reconnecting to work either, but I think thats probably my fault. The client tries to reconnect, but the server gives it a new session (instead of resuming the disconnected session)
[22:26] EyePulp: Cheery: context has a point - sitting in the node channel singing praises to nosql doesn't say much about your expectaiotns of stability and performance.
[22:26] justinw312: I probably have a setting wrong
[22:27] EyePulp: *expectations
[22:28] Cheery: EyePulp: reading about these things all the time. I haven't yet found out which one I would pick. but then it seems even you know that I don't find what I need here.
[22:28] justinw312: I'm having a lot of fun with socket/nods/redis for a chat/rpg hybrid project I'm working on
[22:29] Cheery: going to still look around for solutions for node.js since it seems to gain more momentum than python, and is noticeably nicer than php.
[22:29] EyePulp: Cheery:  honestly I've seen no evidence that you understand what you're asking for.  I think you need to build some things, handle some traffic, and see some actual production loads before these broad assertions you're making are anything more than simply talking to be heard.

[22:38] justinw312: If my understanding is correct, nothing special needs to be done on the server side to support reconnects in socket.io. The server just buffers the output and sends it upon reconnect. Can anyone confirm if this is correct of if I'm wrong?

[23:34] jonaslund: or correctly.. V8
[23:35] jonaslund: AAA_awright: If V8 supports something you should be able to replace the V8 tree (or use a separate install) and get the benefits

[23:37] chjj: jesusabdullah: did you look at mozilla docs?
[23:37] jesusabdullah: chjj: I haven't! I always just use The Google and get disappointing links to w3schools
[23:37] chjj: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Gecko_DOM_Reference
[23:37] AAA_awright: jesusabdullah: The Mozilla DOM reference, or the W3C Recommendations themselves
[23:38] jonaslund: hrrrm
[23:38] jesusabdullah: I've had really good luck with mozilla docs in the past :) and I usually find w3c stuff pretty dry

[23:43] hansschmucker: Hi everybody.... I'M having a slight problem building node.js on Windows... it bails early with a Geman (my system locale) message that seems to suggest that tools/wafadmin/Utils.py/exec_command accidently uses cmd.exe instead of bash to run its code.... which of course doesn't work. Has anybody else come across this issue?

[23:45] hansschmucker: Gee, I'm the creator of a new language ;) But seriously, has anybody else experienced this problem?
[23:45] jesusabdullah: More seriously: I haven't heard of anyone coming across this issue, but I'm not here all the time either.
[23:45] jesusabdullah: Either way, it *is* a problem
[23:46] jesusabdullah: -heh-

[23:47] jonaslund: hansschmucker: hrrm
[23:47] jesusabdullah: If nobody in here has any ideas, I'd suggest filing a github issue. They'll see it eventually!
[23:47] hansschmucker: I'm a newbie.... so is there a particular protocol on when and how people should be contacted?
[23:47] jesusabdullah: Oh, also, check the github issues to make sure nobody's had the issue also
[23:47] hansschmucker: Allright I'll do that.... and stick arond here, maybe someone comes to visit
[23:47] jesusabdullah: hansschmucker: People here are pretty chill. :)
[23:47] jonaslund: hansschmucker: what compiler are you using ?
[23:47] hansschmucker: Normal MinGW
[23:48] hansschmucker: but it doesn't really get that far
[23:48] jonaslund: are you building the 4.x release from the homepage or from git ?
[23:48] jonaslund: (Also do you have MSVC installed ?)
[23:48] hansschmucker: it bails on cp -r c:\node\deps\uv/* c:\node\build\default\/deps/uv &&  if [[ -z "$NODE_MAKE" ]]; then NODE_MAKE=make; fi; $NODE_MAKE -C c:\node\build\default\/deps/uv
[23:49] hansschmucker: I have C# Express installed, but I changed the compiler order
[23:49] hansschmucker: so that shouldn't be the problem

[23:49] hansschmucker: I get a "-z not valid here" message
[23:49] hansschmucker: in *Geman* of course
[23:49] hansschmucker: Which is what cmd.exe would say
[23:49] jonaslund: It was a while i built it
[23:50] jesusabdullah: ^__^
[23:50] jonaslund: while ago
[23:50] jonaslund: damn i've lost all my spelling in the last few days
[23:50] hansschmucker: I'm not entirely clear what uses what, which makes things even more difficult to track
[23:50] hansschmucker: I have MinGW installed, but I'm not sure how much the GIT commandline installed itself
[23:51] hansschmucker: it's probably using it's own local copy
[23:51] hansschmucker: gcc version 4.4.0 (TDM-1 mingw32)
[23:51] jonaslund: you only use git manually
[23:51] jerrysv: jesusabdullah: maple, arm, but arduino compatible
[23:51] jonaslund: what i was wondering if you were using the downloaded package or if you checked out the git code yourself
[23:51] jesusabdullah: jerrysv: What's up? Maple?
[23:51] AAA_awright: Git isn't an acronym
[23:51] hansschmucker: Checked it out myself
[23:51] hansschmucker: sorry, AAA_awright
[23:51] AAA_awright: :p
[23:52] hansschmucker: I'm a bit oldfashioned.... only ever worked with CVS and SVN
[23:52] jesusabdullah: Now we have to backronym is
[23:52] jerrysv: jesusabdullah: yeah, conversation from saturday night: http://leaflabs.com/devices/maple/
[23:53] jesusabdullah: *geekgasm*
[23:53] hansschmucker: Anyway, I basically followed the instructions... Installed Python, Installed Git installer, which loads its own MinGW and compiles Git, then checked out source via Git-included bash and configure/make
[23:53] mscdex: heh
[23:53] jesusabdullah: That is smexy!
[23:53] jonaslund: hansschmucker: if you've checked out node from git yourself you should make sure to use the 4.x branch
[23:53] mscdex: i got a pandaboard on the way!
[23:53] mscdex: :-D
[23:53] jonaslund: hansschmucker: or download the prepared source package from the homepage
[23:53] jonaslund: hansschmucker: apperantly there is alot of development going on right now
[23:53] hansschmucker: Followed the howto, let me check waht I checked out :)
[23:53] jerrysv: jesusabdullah: and only like $45
[23:54] jesusabdullah: Yeah
[23:54] jesusabdullah: Lookit all those channels
[23:54] jesusabdullah: I love me some channels
[23:54] hansschmucker: Guess I should just use the binaries.... it just seemed so simple and straight-forward
[23:54] jonaslund: source is good if you wanna use or do extensions
[23:54] jerrysv: jesusabdullah: and compatible with most arduino addons

[23:56] hansschmucker: 0.4.7
[23:56] jonaslund: hansschmucker: replace the git clone stage with extracting http://nodejs.org/dist/node-v0.4.8.tar.gz
[23:56] hansschmucker: My background is Javascript....
[23:56] jonaslund: and try building again
[23:56] mscdex: is the mingw port even complete yet?
[23:57] jonaslund: mscdex: It works for the limited stuff i've done

[23:57] jesusabdullah: Word.

[23:57] mscdex: Excel.
[23:57] mscdex: :D
[23:57] jonaslund: Should be mostly ok for development
[23:57] hansschmucker: C, C++, BASIC is you want to go that far bar
[23:58] jonaslund: deployment.. njah :)
