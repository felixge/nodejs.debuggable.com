[00:00] Charuru: wafflesburger: if you cache templates on the serverside then speed doesn't matter at all :)
[00:00] wafflesburger: i mean clientside templating charuru :D
[00:01] wafflesburger: i only ask in here because it's more active than jquery or other relevant channels :d
[00:01] Charuru: oh
[00:01] Charuru: well yeah on the client i do use doT
[00:01] Charuru: ACTION shrugs
[00:01] wafflesburger: is that benchmark i linked to broken
[00:01] wafflesburger: templat generated in 1.7 nanoseconds? :D
[00:03] Charuru: i write my serverside templates in jade
[00:03] wafflesburger: same
[00:03] Charuru: and that is compiled into more regular html with dot interpolation
[00:04] wafflesburger: whats the difference in doT and doU
[00:05] syskk: do you guys use underscores or camelCase in JS?
[00:06] wafflesburger: camcel
[00:06] wafflesburger: camel*
[00:06] ion-: is there a recommended way of setting extra fields for a new Error object?
[00:06] aaronblohowiak: syskk: camel
[00:07] aaronblohowiak: ion-: you dont have to throw an error, you know.
[00:07] aaronblohowiak: ion-: you can throw anything.  a function, even.
[00:07] syskk: I usually camelCase properties/methods and under_score local variables , anyone else does this?
[00:07] aaronblohowiak: syskk: madness!
[00:07] wafflesburger: nein
[00:08] ion-: aaronblohowiak: im going to emit, not throw. i feel like i should follow what ive seen in node core and use a real Error object
[00:08] aaronblohowiak: ion-: okie dokie
[00:10] syskk: it just feels weird to camelCase local variables :p
[00:11] Twisol: syskk: that's my convention too.
[00:16] ion-: ECMA specification is only available in PDF?
[00:16] ion-: ha
[00:16] syskk: how do you list installed npm packages ?
[00:16] ion-: npm list works for me
[00:17] syskk: thought it listed all available packages
[00:17] ion-: it might have pre 1.0
[00:17] syskk: npm list | grep installed I guess
[00:17] ion-: npm -v

[00:21] a|i: does it make sense to wrap redis in orm?
[00:21] a|i: why do people do that?
[00:21] syskk: maybe to switch from redis to a rdbms but that would be weird
[00:23] a|i: seriously, am I missing something here
[00:23] quackslike: a|i - do you have an example i can see?
[00:24] a|i: quackslike: http://ohm.keyvalue.org/
[00:24] quackslike: cheers
[00:24] ion-: i think the proper way to make customized Error objects is to create a new class that inherits from Error
[00:24] a|i: quackslike: or http://maritz.github.com/nohm/, if you prefer it in js.
[00:25] Gelegrodan: Hm, ive made a simple tcp socket client, problem it it will linebreak the data it recieves, if i connect with putty it seems fine
[00:25] Gelegrodan: buffersize is the key?

[00:27] kriszyp has joined the channel
[00:28] aaronblohowiak: i dont understand ORMs
[00:28] quackslike: a|i - it seems reasonable, but i thought redis stored data structures anyway, seems just like a convenience to use an orm like that
[00:28] aaronblohowiak: quackslike++
[00:28] v8bot:  aaronblohowiak has given a beer to quackslike. quackslike now has 1 beers.
[00:29] quackslike: aaronblohowiak: what do you mean, that you dont understand them? You mean why someone would use one?
[00:29] luigi_fanatiker: node.js 0.6
[00:29] a|i: quackslike: I think people who are against it claim that wrapping nosql with orm loses its atomicity.
[00:29] syskk: ORMs make more sense with RDBMS.
[00:29] aaronblohowiak: quackslike: so, the abstract relational algebra is complex and makes sense to have a set of convienences, but nosql already throws normalization out the window so what is the ORM going to do for you?
[00:30] aaronblohowiak: :-)
[00:30] syskk: a|i: doesn't have to though...
[00:30] syskk: not much...
[00:30] wafflesburger: if you use ORM you won't have to use sql anyways its like a better NOSQL! :D
[00:30] aaronblohowiak: quackslike: sorry i missed your message last night.  i tried working on an alternate set of documentation: http://transitive.io/design/compare.html is that easier than the socratic method one?
[00:31] a|i: quackslike: redis has some data structure, but doesn't do queries, or does it? how do you do queries like find by blabla value in redis?
[00:31] syskk: I always thought Redis and company were simply ORMs on top of RDBMS -_-
[00:31] aaronblohowiak: a|i: redis has no query by value (though you can get a subset of the values stored at a given key for some key types)
[00:31] quackslike: aaronblohowiak: Ok. i see your point. A good orm will give you the ability to use any datastore without changing code, as well as the convenience of persisting Objects - it provides the programmer with a more natural (to  them) view of the data.
[00:32] quackslike: most orms that i see are tied to a specific store, mongo, redis whatever.
[00:32] syskk: right
[00:32] aaronblohowiak: quackslike: plugging in any data store means that you don't fully leverage what makes your data store unique. 
[00:32] quackslike: aaronblohowiak: well, it can if the ORM is clever.
[00:33] aaronblohowiak: quackslike: i prefer simple to clever.
[00:33] quackslike: aaronblohowiak: fair enough. i'm not cheerleading for orms, i think they are handy, but have downsides too.
[00:33] syskk: not using assembly language doesn't fully leverage what makes your CPU unique :)
[00:33] quackslike: syskk: lol
[00:34] syskk: and if you're going to say that good compilers optimize for a given cpu than the same can be said about good ORMs
[00:34] baudehlo1 has joined the channel
[00:34] aaronblohowiak: syskk: actually, it frequently does.  we just prefer portability and sameness in CPU architecture

[00:34] aaronblohowiak: a|i: redis is *NOT* a wrapper for a relational model.
[00:34] wafflesburger: seperate components for each query
[00:34] quackslike: wafflesburger: :)
[00:34] a|i: aaronblohowiak: I was referring to ohm, not redis.
[00:34] aaronblohowiak: a|i: ah, nvm
[00:35] KirinDave has joined the channel
[00:35] a|i: if you cannot do querying by value, then what's the point of a datastore that doesn't let you retrieve the data?

[00:59] halfhalo: only 50 eh?
[00:59] Gelegrodan: yepp
[00:59] Gelegrodan: well 5 now
[01:00] syskk: mmm npm now creates a npm_module directory
[01:00] mscdex: "640 ssh windows is enough for anybody" -- b.g.

[01:00] aaronblohowiak: pkrumins: can you explain .join() in lazy?
[01:01] mscdex: syskk: npm_modules or node_modules ?
[01:01] wafflesburger: or just concatenates strings

[13:46] floby: I'm manipulating the filesystem using the fs module. I need to remove a directory, there is only rmdir available which requires the directory to be empty. How do I go about removing a directory and all its files?
[13:47] copongcopong has joined the channel
[13:47] gonsfx has joined the channel
[13:47] chjj: floby: you have to recursively walk the directory and delete everything
[13:48] matyr has joined the channel
[13:48] liquidproof: floby: fs.readdir -> fs.unlink -> fs.rmdir
[13:48] floby: well that's a pain. thanks
[13:49] floby: is there any module doing this or easing this?
[13:49] chjj: a directory walk is actually a rather small function
[13:49] chjj: ill gist a directory walk function for you

[13:53] swick: what does assertion failed "handle->InternalFieldCount() > 0" mean?
[13:54] floby: swick: v8 C++ stuff. Javascript objects can embed C++ fields (usually pointer) in an array. The size of the array has to be specified before construction.
[13:56] swick: floby: and how do i know how many fields i need :s
[13:57] floby: swick: if you need more than one or two, you're probably doing it wrong. internalfield are used to link a javascript object to its C++ counterpart. so you should need only one where you store the pointer to your C++ object.
[13:58] swick: floby: i believe i have set it to 1 (InstanceTemplate()->SetInternalFieldCount(1))

[14:14] chjj: eguest309: what do you need help with?
[14:14] eguest309: i wanted to know if  socket.io can try reconnecting if it   tries connecting to a server and it cant get a connection.i tried it with the reconnct option but that doesnt seem to do the  trick
[14:15] Renegade001: chjj: Thanks
[14:15] `3rdEden: eguest309 the current npm build doesn't include the reconnection support yet
[14:15] `3rdEden: we forgot to update the client in the npm release
[14:16] `3rdEden: we will be creating another socket.io maintance release this weekend
[14:16] `3rdEden: which will included reconnection support
[14:16] chjj: i wish npm publishes could just point to github repos :(
[14:17] `3rdEden: chjj it can :)
[14:17] chjj: oh?
[14:17] chjj: enlighten me sir
[14:17] chjj: !
[14:17] `3rdEden: you can specify the tarball location of the repo if i'm not mistaken
[14:17] mynyml has joined the channel
[14:17] eguest309: okay.so if i were to want to check for lost connections, i may have to do a javascript timer of sorts which  runs and always checks  whether a socekt has been disconnected
[14:17] chjj: just in the package.json?
[14:18] `3rdEden: chjj if i remember correctly yup, but it might just have been for depencencies .. ._.
[14:18] chjj: ah
[14:18] `3rdEden: eguest309 yes about that
[14:19] Renegade001: I know this isn't really the place, but is there a way to clone previous version of a repository like for instance clone 0.4.7 of Node?
[14:19] `3rdEden: Renegade001 most repo's are tagged
[14:19] `3rdEden: so in git you can just do `git checkout` with the branch name or tag
[14:20] chjj: git checkout v0.4..5
[14:20] chjj: minus the .
[14:20] Renegade001: 3rdEden, chjj, Ah thanks :D
[14:29] Renegade001: chjj: Sorry, I'm not the best with git yet but how do I actually specify the node repository to checkout that tag
[14:29] chjj: it will go by your cwd's .git repo
[14:30] Gelegrodan: `3rdEden: you should change the readme of socket.io-node on github.. it says "npm install socket.io-node"
[14:30] Gelegrodan: but that just gives a 404 error
[14:31] Renegade001: chjj: so clone node first, then checkout a previous version?
[14:31] chjj: so cd node or wherever you originally cloned node to, and type git checkout x.x.x
[14:31] Renegade001: I see, thanks
[14:31] chjj: yes, that works

[15:39] Postmodernist: I have a perl script that sets up a base Ubuntu or Debian box with everything needed, including configuring/installing Postgresql and nginx.
[15:39] simplesoon: but isn't that node 2.6 or something

[15:40] Postmodernist: (or whatever the current version is)
[15:40] secoif: or use brew
[15:40] secoif: brew good.
[15:41] secoif: you can then do a brew install npm to get the npm install instructions

[16:20] secoif: my understanding is that is' so a library can depend on specific versions
[16:20] simplesoon: notice how you have stitch as a part of spine and as a top level module
[16:20] secoif: yep

[17:39] justinw312: secoif: It's such a different way of thinking, it's taking me a while to wrap my head around it and do things the right way.
[17:39] secoif: probably the easiest way to do it is to initialize everything in a create() that takes a function callback and execute the callback once it's done initialising
[17:40] secoif: eg
[17:40] secoif: DB.initialize(function() { // do this stuff once the DB is initialized});
[17:41] FredFred has joined the channel
[17:41] secoif: doing a command buffer is probably a bit extreme, just use a callback

[19:49] eldar: chjj, that's exactly what I'm doing, but data returned isn't a string, but rather a <buffer>
[19:49] chjj: or you could do data.toString('utf-8'), that works too, but not necessarily a good habit though because if the data is streaming you need a stringdecoder
[19:49] chjj: eldar: that should work
[19:50] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: so your lib would have a .err() function that would accept an error handler ?
[19:50] chjj: its a buffer by default, when you dont set an encoding
[19:51] eldar: chjj, yeah just tried data.toString("utf8") and it worked
[19:51] eldar: thanks
[19:51] eldar: I should have looked in the buffer api
[19:51] chjj: the other way should work, and i recommend that more
[19:52] chjj: just remember if data is streaming in, you cant simply do str += data.toString('utf-8');

[20:22] Wizek: Anyone knows what EPERM error (http://prntscr.com/1vrg0) means and why I cannot catch it?
[20:23] sikker: chjj, what I'm thinking is, as an excersise, porting my favourite PHP framework to Node. For purely educational purposes. So I'd like a ready-made webserver I can just code against
[20:23] stisti: You are trying to open a socket?
[20:23] stisti: A unix domain socket?
[20:25] stisti: Wizek: Did you try to add an 'error' event handler?
[20:27] Wizek: stisti, it's the internals of node-mysql, whereas the client.connect() triggers this error. If I take a look inside, maybe I find that errors aren't handled, but I tought it would bouble out. Why doesn't it?
[20:28] andrewfff has joined the channel
[20:29] stisti: I'm guessing you are trying to open a unix domain socket to mysql server but you do not have permission to connect to the socket the mysqld is listening

[20:44] smlefo: oh
[20:44] smlefo: beats me... use lighttp for that stuff... is node really ready for production stuff anyways?
[20:44] NuckingFuts: smlefo: I would personally say yes.
[20:45] NuckingFuts: Because Node *is* stable, though it's still changing a lot
[20:45] NuckingFuts: It is highly reliable
[20:45] smlefo: not sure that sentence makes sense
[20:45] chjj: i would also say yes for the most part, unless your life depends on your server
[20:46] NuckingFuts: smlefo: things are changing still, but node is reliable enough to work in production.
[20:46] smlefo: *shrug* so then use it for a file server if it's ready for production?

[20:49] NuckingFuts: chjj: lol
[20:49] chjj: i still cant get over that article
[20:49] chjj: :(
[20:49] tim_smart: NuckingFuts: If you are using the sendfile stuff with node, it is not too bad. But still doesn't compare with nginx unless you cache all the buffers in memory
[20:49] NuckingFuts: chjj: I tried to read it, but I was about to go shoot up IBM's HQ after the first paragraph, and the "spawning a process" thing
[20:50] chjj: i think that mightve been the worst part of the article
[20:51] NuckingFuts: I'm seriously wondering what made the guy think that.
[20:51] chjj: the worst part was when i read that guy is a programmer
[20:51] NuckingFuts: There is NO WAY you can mix up "managing a threadpool for async I/O" with "spawns a process for each connection"

I've tried reading up but no wheres got a great deal on application logic. I watched Ryans video on the home page, that was pretty good.

[22:45] jet18: @mscdex: Its really easy to use, dont get me wrong. But twilio is cheaper by a few cents and thats where it counts. If I had a us billing id deffinitley use them.

[22:47] jet18: no bother, ever worked with any phone services before? Tropo has 24/7-ish support. If your hight scale you can go directly to voxeo who are the parent of tropo but your looking at $500+ monthly costs.
[22:47] jet18: @aaronblohowiak: Thanks a bunch for the help!

[23:14] linnk: ryah: hey :) I was wondering if you ever thought about labelling issues on GitHub that "beginners" can help out with? like, code that has to be moved around or modified slightly, copy/paste stuff, renaming, small fixes and such.. I really want to contribute more, but my C++ is weak (I'm learning quickly though), and I think others might be in the same situation

[23:16] mscdex: dekz: you saw node-oscar right?
[23:16] NuckingFuts: Or if anyone could suggest ideas of how to do JSON without constant %-encoding in the URL's JSON payload
[23:16] deedubs: sherod: what about uuid?
[23:17] linnk: ryah: that sounds very sensible. Is it the libuv rewrite?

[23:21] a|i: mscdex: any quick fix?
[23:21] Postmodernist: Look at line 75
[23:21] sherod: deedbus: ah. well that was simple... or would be if it could find a c++ compiler on my mac.  I shall google.
