[00:14] cbobo: How do we install modules for node.js ?
[00:14] dynacker: npm
[00:14] cbobo: https://github.com/ncr/node.ws.js
[00:14] cbobo: i want that one though...
[00:15] AphelionZ: Check this out
[00:15] cbobo: and it says it is not in the npm 
[00:15] isaacs: jerrysv, chase: That shouldn't even be a question.
[00:15] cbobo: npm ERR! 404 'ws' is not in the npm registry.
[00:15] AphelionZ: they say all work no play
[00:15] AphelionZ: but what about like.. no work, no play
[00:15] isaacs: cbobo: looks pretty out of date.
[00:15] markdaws: chase: http.request is pretty simple to use to do a POST
[00:15] isaacs: cbobo: doesn't have a package.json, advertises compatibility with node 0.1.91
[00:16] cbobo: http://zackhobson.com/2010/03/28/node-js-and-web-sockets.html
[00:16] cbobo: ya okay, i was reading that and trying to set up some websockets and what not
[00:16] cbobo: so that I can interact with a socket on the backend
[00:16] isaacs: cbobo: try running this:  npm search websocket server
[00:17] cbobo: okay cool, i will try one of them
[00:17] cbobo: NAME                  DESCRIPTION                                                   AUTHOR        KEYWORDS

[00:18] isaacs: cbobo: good idea.
[00:18] isaacs: cbobo: can you post an issue for it?
[00:18] chase: isaacs, jerrsv: just wanted ot make sure I took the best route
[00:18] chase: using express
[00:18] chase: tried using it
[00:18] chase: but cant seem to make it work right
[00:19] chase: probably ID10T error
[00:19] cbobo: isaacs: not sure how to post issues and I only have 3hrs left till my gf comes home
[00:19] jp323_ has joined the channel
[00:19] jerrysv: chase: sorry, i don't use express, i use bricks :)
[00:19] cbobo: and wanted to do some node.js today =]
[00:19] chase: you recommend over express?
[00:20] jerrysv: chase: i do - i wrote it. but check out the docs, go through the slides, and make your own decision
[00:20] Archen has joined the channel

[00:23] jesusabdullah: chase: express is kind of a de facto standard when it comes to node frameworks---it's either that or the basic http api
[00:24] jesusabdullah: which isn't really that hard or anything, but middleware has its advantages!
[00:24] jerrysv: jesusabdullah: i disagree with your "either"
[00:24] chase: jerrysv: oh i see your bias ;), checking it out though now
[00:24] jerrysv: chase: and i'm happy to point out my bias :)
[00:24] jesusabdullah: well, not that you have no choice
[00:24] chase: jerrsv: I'm already more of a fan of your routing setup
[00:24] jp323 has joined the channel
[00:24] jesusabdullah: just that those are probably the most common tools people are using for this kinda thing
[00:24] jerrysv: chase: yeah, that and the events is why i wrote it
[00:25] jesusabdullah: Obviously you could use bricks instead of express
[00:25] skm has joined the channel
[00:25] jesusabdullah: One time I made a half-assed framework on accident
[00:25] jesusabdullah: I was just writing a webapp and before I knew it I had routes and templates
[00:25] chase: jesusabdullah: yea i tend to stray where the most documentation and examples can be found
[00:25] jerrysv: jesusabdullah: same here, then a more fully baked one, then another one, and then another one, then spent a lot of time in express, then went back and rebuilt mine
[00:25] jesusabdullah: Yeah, that seems reasonable
[00:26] jesusabdullah: though, old projects tend to have a larger body of documentation
[00:26] jesusabdullah: s/old/crusty/
[00:26] jesusabdullah: well
[00:26] jerrysv: as much as i hate apache, there were some aspects of its pattern that i really like
[00:26] jesusabdullah: old and crusty
[00:27] chase: with that said .. another noob question,, if express has http as a dependency, do i still need to require http as its own entity to use it as http.request?
[00:27] davidsklar has joined the channel
[00:27] jesusabdullah: yes
[00:27] tjholowaychuk: chase http is for the server
[00:27] jerrysv: you need to require any module any time you need it and it is not in scope
[00:27] jesusabdullah: You can use express without requiring http, but if you want to use something that's in http directly you'll have to require the http module explicitly
[00:27] jesusabdullah: express doesn't expose it for you
[00:29] digman543 has joined the channel
[00:30] chase: awesome thank you, another first timer question ... whos to say someone can't just setup a socket on their client socket.io and connect to my server? whats the best way of securing that?
[00:31] postwait has joined the channel
[00:31] localhost has joined the channel
[00:31] hasenj has joined the channel
[00:31] dynacker: good question
[00:31] jerrysv: chase: what would be an example of not wanting to allow that?
[00:31] jesusabdullah: chase_farmer: I think you just have to either have your websocket-exposed api be public, or add an auth step
[00:32] dynacker: how would the auth step work jesusabdullah 
[00:32] dynacker: guess you would need to validate that the client IP got the socket files within the last x time
[00:32] chase_farmer: jerrysv: someone passing malicious code back to my socket. I guess its on me to make sure the socket functions passed back are sanitized to make sure that doesn't happen
[00:32] dynacker: not really stopping, just slowing them down
[00:32] dynacker: what you said chase_farmer 
[00:33] dynacker: just like any other API you need to secure the server side
[00:33] dynacker: and assume peopel will try fuck with it
[00:33] jesusabdullah: dynacker: It's a persistent connection, you just have to make sure the client has the right credentials and just re-auth if the connection closes
[00:33] chase_farmer: definitely do, just curious if there was a de facto standard
[00:33] jesusabdullah: I'm speaking conceptually---I've never had to do this with socket.io
[00:33] jerrysv: chase_farmer: exactly, just assume someone will get through, and sanitize/check everything
[00:34] dynacker: validate everything that comes in
[00:34] dynacker: etc.
[00:34] jerrysv: reminds me of that tv chat app for the node competition
[00:34] jerrysv: and dom injection attacks
[00:34] chase_farmer: anyone know of a good NPM for sanitizing form data?
[00:35] jesusabdullah: idk if there's more than one npm yo ;)
[00:35] chase_farmer: npm module

[01:27] diogogmt: hey guys
[01:27] diogogmt: I' m trying to implement an application
[01:27] diogogmt: that from the php will call the node.js server
[01:27] diogogmt: send some data
[01:27] diogogmt: and in the node.js server will connect with other webservices
[01:28] shimondoodkin has joined the channel
[01:28] diogogmt: especificaly with the google calendar api
[01:28] diogogmt: I' m not sure if that is posible
[01:28] diogogmt: to connect with node via php
[01:28] diogogmt: ?
[01:29] lepht has joined the channel
[01:30] AvianFlu: diogogmt, I've seen articles about integrating node with drupal

[01:32] diogogmt: AvianFlu: actually the php script will be run as a cron job
[01:32] diogogmt: and the calendar api offer some extra features when connectin with javascript
[01:33] diogogmt: so I wanted to manage all the interaction with js using node instead of using php
[01:33] AvianFlu: how big is the php?  is it something you could do all node?
[01:34] AvianFlu: if you're running the php with cron, it seems like you could substitute several languages, unless you specifically need php
[01:35] diogogmt: the application started using php, I'm gettin involved in the middle of the development
[01:35] diogogmt: the only thing php is doing
[01:35] diogogmt: is connecting to the db
[01:35] diogogmt: mssql
[01:35] diogogmt: to fecth the data
[01:36] diogogmt: but I saw that node doesn't offer support for mssql yet, only mysql

[01:39] diogogmt: igl: but is it stable? anybody ever tried before?
[01:39] diogogmt: the website is already in production
[01:39] AvianFlu: yeah I'd use your existing db stuff then
[01:39] kurtzhong has joined the channel
[01:39] AvianFlu: you could start the node as a child process, that would probably take the least work
[01:40] AvianFlu: I haven't had to do that in php before though
[01:41] AvianFlu: pick an easy way to get node the data - a file, argv[], a tcp connection, a unix socket - and just pass it along
[01:41] AvianFlu: I'm no php master, though
[01:42] diogogmt: Is deff an option, for now I'll probably use the php api, but keep testing in parallel using node
[01:44] CarterL has joined the channel
[01:44] inpho has joined the channel
[01:45] AvianFlu: diogogmt, that actually sounds like a great opportunity to learn node
[01:45] AvianFlu: developing something in php and node at the same time - since you already know php
[01:47] diogogmt: Even if they don't decide to use node in the main project, I'll keep developing on the side. It takes a while to people accept new ideas
[01:47] diogogmt: specially in the software programming field

[03:10] dmsuperman: Yeah
[03:10] AvianFlu: type java at your prompt
[03:10] AvianFlu: what happens
[03:10] dmsuperman: java no found
[03:10] mdunn: does node ned java?

[03:11] indexzero has joined the channel
[03:11] mdunn: my command is just node app.js
[03:11] dmsuperman: something is running a shell scrip which is trying to run java

[03:14] AvianFlu: can you gist this code?

[03:14] AvianFlu: none of those should be spawning java as a child process, as far as I know
[03:14] mdunn: exactly. seems odd
[03:15] AvianFlu: it's also calling /bin/sh
[03:15] AvianFlu: I would expect bash
[03:16] mdunn: ahh.. I wonder if its smtpc perhaps
[03:16] mdunn: im requireing smptc on another page this ties to
[03:16] digiwano: the stacktrace that didnt get fully pasted should tell you
[03:16] mdunn: *smtpc
[03:16] digiwano: your paste cut off at " at Array.<anonymous> ("
[03:17] digiwano: a few more lines down probably tells you exactly whats trying to call java
[03:17] mdunn: at Array.<anonymous> (net.js:831:12)     at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:126:26)
[03:18] AvianFlu: stack traces go the opposite way
[03:18] AvianFlu: something is bombing because there's a cp call with no exit handler and a 127 is coming back
[03:18] AvianFlu: that's my guess
[03:18] AvianFlu: it's not smtpc, I just read the code

[03:31] ryanrolds: I'm curious when he gets the error.
[03:32] Sly__: isaacs, ping.

[03:47] mdunn: anyone recommend a mongolian alternative? already tried mongous and a few others
[03:48] chance-: you mean mongoose?
[03:48] ryanrolds: Using java in a node app is a bit odd, but if you like the module and are ok with having java installed, use it.
[03:48] mdunn: tried mongoose as well
[03:48] chance-: ah
[03:48] chance-: hadnt heard of mongous

[03:52] Nuck: AAA_awright: >_>
[03:52] Sly__: There aren't any options being passed in it. Options are passed in an object.
[03:53] Sly__: If it's a string, it's returned as a URL in .get()..
[03:53] ryanrolds: Oh, gotcha.
[03:53] ryanrolds: I should have looked at the docs for .get()
[03:53] jesusabdullah: Holy shit, mixu gut nwm running well enough to be his primary window manager
[03:53] jesusabdullah: https://github.com/mixu/nwm
[03:54] Sly__: .get({host: 'google.com', path: '/'}, function (res) { console.log(res); });
[03:54] Sly__: That would be a normal .get().
[03:54] Sly__: Mine would change it to..
[03:54] Sly__: .get('www.google.com',function (res) { console.log(res); });
[03:54] Sly__: Etc.

[04:01] ryanrolds: Sly__: May want to check if options is string to avoid running and obj through valid. Also put braces in that if else.

[04:02] paulwe has joined the channel
[04:02] dgathright has joined the channel
[04:02] Sly__: ryanrolds, options is validated as a string in lib/url.js.
[04:02] Sly__: If it's not a string when .valid() is ran, it returns false.
[04:03] ryanrolds: Right, but why try to run an object through a regex when it's easy to check if before hand.
[04:04] Sly__: It's not ran through regex if it's not an object.
[04:04] Sly__: The typeof is before the regex.

[04:05] reid has joined the channel
[04:06] ryanrolds: It looks like if a string is is passed in the first param is run through .valid() and if valid isn't false it packages up the string in to a valid options obj.

[04:07] gxdssoft has joined the channel
[04:07] Sly__: Okay. What exactly are you asking about?
[04:07] ryanrolds: And that most def runs what optins is, object or string, through a regex.
[04:08] ryanrolds: *runs whatever options
[04:08] Sly__: When it's ran through .valid(), the typeof is before the regex.
[04:09] Sly__: If it's not a string, it will instantly return false.

[04:15] Nuck: AAA_awright: Hey broski, you dead?
[04:15] Sly__: It was dropping objects because of that else.
[04:15] Sly__: Was using it to test .valid() earlier, and never removed it.
[04:15] ryanrolds: Ok, I was looking at the first cut of lib/url.js. That updated one is better. I'm being nit picky, but avoiding hitting the require on an obj would be cool. Other then that nigling issue the only other issue I see is style issues, like not having braces on an if else.
[04:16] Sly__: I'm not one for using braces on an "else if".
[04:16] ryanrolds: The Google JS style rules also uses the C++ style rules: Short conditional statements may be written on one line if this enhances readability. You may use this only when the line is brief and the statement does not use the else clause.
[04:16] Sly__: Should be fairly simple to follow it, with the way that I code.
[04:17] Sly__: if { } else if { } else if { } else { }
[04:18] ryanrolds: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Contributing: "Javascript code style should follow Google’s JavaScript style guide and be run through the linter. `make jslint` to validate."
[04:18] ryanrolds: I'm pedantic, I know.
[04:19] Sly__: `make jslint` shows 'Found 1596 errors, including 447 new errors, in 181 files (244 files OK).'

[07:30] chrisvtx: well, im trying to create an efficient architecture for a web app where the frontend layer could pass js objects to the server and have node do some server heavy lifting instead of having the front end pass js ajax calls to php/server and wait for a response...

[07:48] icebox: lz: for the error handling there are always the same questions (however async doesn't add any complexity): how to handle a backend error, how to notice it to the user and what to do.
[07:49] icebox: lz: scaling issue is an overrated issue. if the app is well designed, a standard hw should handle many requests.
[07:50] k1ttty has joined the channel
[07:51] lz: icebox, gotcha, thanks for the insight.
[07:52] icebox: lz: about bottlenecks... yes... when the app connects to legacy system, it is a pain... a sort of solution is creating a virtual layer, synced offline with the legacy
[07:53] lz: icebox, ic, sorta creating a cache for legacy systems?
[07:53] icebox: lz: yes... but it depends on the features of the app
[07:53] aaronmcadam has joined the channel
[07:54] icebox: lz: if the app needs a balance of a customer now, I cannot save the balance of previous day... so there is always a tradeoff
[07:55] lz: icebox, ic, I guess theoretically you could cache higher frequencies for on-demand data, like every minute or second.. but that might kill a legacy system :)
[07:56] icebox: lz: yes... tried... exactly the legacy dies in five minutes :)
[07:57] tylerstalder has joined the channel
[07:57] lz: icebox, don't you love doing that?

[12:55] Glenjamin: the changelog will have details. If you don't allow an core APIs to change you end up with PHP
[12:55] iszak: Glenjamin, I'm just finding out dated libraries for node.js which are no longer maintained / supported and it's kind of frustrating.

[12:56] Glenjamin: iszak: mm, that is a problem - what libs are you after?
[12:57] chany: glenjamin: does that supply intellisense for node.js and all its plugins eg.socket.io I just find intellisense more helpful than having to trawl through documentation

[15:14] bnoordhuis: luxigo: btw, don't pass an encoding to res.write() if b is a buffer - it doesn't hurt but it doesn't help either
[15:15] bnoordhuis: and you should probably specify "Transfer-Encoding: chunked"
[15:15] luxigo: bnoordhuis: for a file you must use a readStream and call res.write() from the on 'data' listeneer, because res.end(fs.readFileSync) just doesnt works  ...  im ok with it as long it works, but i cant figure how to use response.write() to send a png from a buffer object instead of a file..

[19:49] r04r: though it starts and ends with a linebreak. Is it supposed to be like that?
[19:49] isaacs: r04r: maybe you have an outdated version of curl?  or, you can edit the script to just accept self-signed certs instead
[19:49] catshirt: ty!
[19:49] isaacs: r04r: yeah, that should be fine
[19:50] neilk_ has joined the channel
[19:50] r04r: Curl should be the latest in the debian repo I'm using :/ But yeah, I'll edit the script to do that
[19:50] isaacs: r04r: or you could add my CA cert to your system's keychain, however that's done
[19:51] isaacs: r04r: then you can also go to urls like https://registry.npmjs.org/-/fields and see a green lock instead of a red x

[19:55] TheJH: uah, I'm really bad at this. How to make a Handle out of/for a Buffer so that I can attach it to an array and return it?
[19:55] colinclark has joined the channel
[19:55] TheJH: cc bnoordhuis
[19:56] isaacs: TheJH: you mean my_buffer_obj->handle_?
[19:56] bnoordhuis: TheJH: you mean a->Set(0, buf->handle_)?
[19:56] isaacs: like that?
[19:56] bnoordhuis: heh, great minds
[19:56] TheJH: thanks :)
[19:56] isaacs: r04r: that's odd.  you shouldn't be able to get a SSL auth failure without a reason.
[19:56] isaacs: r04r: maybe try setting `strict-ssl = false` in your ~/.npmrc file
[19:57] isaacs: r04r: though, that meanst hat you won't be validating ssl certs, which is inherently insecure
[19:57] randylien has joined the channel
[19:57] isaacs: r04r: you'll get crypto, but not validation
[19:57] TheJH: translated error message: »class node::Buffer« has no member named »_handle«
[19:58] isaacs: TheJH: handle_ not _handle
[19:58] Sly__: lol.
[19:58] TheJH: oops
[19:58] Sly__: throw { name: 'MyCustomError', message: 'This is a custom message' };
[19:58] Sly__: When I take the semicolon off, jslint says it needs it.
[19:58] isaacs: :)
[19:58] Sly__: When I add it, it says it doesn't need it.
[19:58] TheJH: it compiles :)
[19:58] Sly__: Pretty funny. :x
[19:58] isaacs: Sly__: why are you throwing a non-Error object?
[19:58] isaacs: where is that?
[19:58] r04r: isaacs: Will try. That's mostly fine because I just need a few npm packages and once I'm done npm will go again. FYI I just tested my own quick server setup and it seems the nodejs ssl implementation is working atleast
[19:58] vicapow: as anyone considered the possibility of collisions with duplicate sessions and session data using connect?
[19:58] Sly__: That's in test/message/throw_custom_error.js
[19:58] jocafa: throw "fit";
[19:58] isaacs: oh, right :)

[20:00] neekers has joined the channel
[20:00] Sly__: Added it in, isaacs. Testing with jslint now.
[20:00] isaacs: so, as long as you trust that *I'M* not evil, you can trust that https://registry.npmjs.org/ is legit
[20:00] isaacs: and if i'm evil, you shouldn't use npm at all :)
[20:00] vicapow: isaacs: damn
[20:01] r04r: isaacs: But it's convenient
[20:01] fly-away has joined the channel
[20:01] isaacs: to be fair, you also have to trust that mikeal and JasonSmith aren't evil, since they both have admin access to the npm couchdb
[20:01] neekers: i've been googling for tutorials for node.js and websockets and there are so many different libraries. can someone tell me what the latest or best practice library is for working with websockets?
[20:01] isaacs: and can thus inject bad things int here.
[20:01] r04r: uh oh
[20:02] vicapow: neekers: socket.io
[20:02] isaacs: and you have to trust the author of whatever packages you install.
[20:02] isaacs: neekers: if you think you want websockets, you probably actually want socket.io
[20:02] neekers: vicapow: thanks

[20:02] TheJH: isaacs, do you maybe also know what could case a require-time error "undefined symbol: ev_default_loop_ptr"?
[20:02] chilts: at least the good thing is that you can read their code before installing it :)
[20:02] TheJH: *cause
[20:02] chilts: which means if you've read it, you can trust it :D
[20:03] TheJH: chilts, nah, you can hide backdoors in source code
[20:03] eldios: if you wanted to create a crossplatfom *desktop* graphical application with a systray and some simple windows.. what would you use? ruby? python? java? since there's no nodejs out atm =)
[20:03] TheJH: chilts, do you know the winner of that "make an area black but don't really delete the information in a PPM image" competition?
[20:04] Sly__: No dice, isaacs. That method didn't work.
[20:04] TheJH: eldios, apart from the systray, wouldn't chromium in application mode work?
[20:04] r04r: Hm. Installing the certificate doesn't seem to help, and `strict-ssl = false` is now giving another error. `socket hang up` 
[20:04] isaacs: r04r: weird
[20:04] r04r: ...And now it works.
[20:05] isaacs: r04r: maybe the https client is just acting up?  try registry = http://registry.npmjs.org/ maybe?
[20:05] isaacs: oh, ok
[20:05] isaacs: great :)
[20:05] eldios: TheJH, I'll go check it =)
[20:05] eldios: thanks for the hint.. any other hint would be appreciated

[20:06] DrMcKay: r04r: ^
[20:06] DrMcKay: r04r: I believe that it's a simple tar gz, it contains npm
[20:06] DrMcKay: r04r: you should be able to install it from this tarball, using npm in this tarball

[20:10] DrMcKay: TheJH: yes
[20:10] DrMcKay: TheJH: you're using module compiled for a different version
[20:10] JasonSmith: The point of CouchDB (just like Git) is not to be a trust silver bullet but to make digital trust work like *real-world* trust, that is, p2p and tacit
[20:10] DrMcKay: most probably you're using module compiled for 0.5 with 04
[20:10] MooGoo: I dont trust shit in the real world
[20:10] TheJH: DrMcKay, well, I just compiled it myself... gonna re-make and install node

[20:15] __sorin__ has joined the channel
[20:15] bnoordhuis: right, that's what i gathered
[20:15] dmsuperman: How can I do Buffer.copy while simultaneously telling the target buffer that the source data is a base64 string
[20:16] bnoordhuis: as to what it does, libev supports multiple event loops but node compiles without that
[20:16] bnoordhuis: so if your add-on compiles with multi-loop support enabled, bad things will happen
[20:16] TheJH: bnoordhuis, yaaay, I can require it :)
[20:16] TheJH: dmsuperman, there's no encoding between buffers
[20:17] dmsuperman: TheJH: What I mean to say is that I have a string buffer containing base64 encoded data in ascii format
[20:17] dmsuperman: It's something like this: derpderp&a8sjdklfj2l389fgf+23jk23489xsf/892345jwer==
[20:17] dmsuperman: I need to extract that base64 code off the end, which I'm currently doing using buffer.copy
[20:18] Renegade001 has joined the channel
[20:18] dmsuperman: And also tell the new buffer that it's stored in that the string is base64 and not just text
[20:18] TheJH: dmsuperman, I think you'll have to do new Buffer(source.toString('ascii'), 'base64')
[20:18] dmsuperman: TheJH: That misses the copy step though
[20:19] dmsuperman: Which I need because I'm not copying the entire buffer

[21:47] djazz: how does the zlib module work? how can I uncompress data?
[21:48] djazz: is it in _buffer?
[21:48] robi42 has joined the channel
[21:48] r04r: Is there any reason why the data event would be fired before the connected event on a tls socket?
[21:49] bnoordhuis: r04r: how / where are you seeing that?
[21:50] perezd has joined the channel
[21:50] smathy: djazz… are you aware of the docs here: https://github.com/kkaefer/node-zlib
[21:51] r04r: bnoordhuis: Connection callback and a listener on the data event I get data->connected->data->data->etc. The connected is like 3 seconds after the first data.
[21:51] djazz: smathy, no, the native zlib module
[21:51] djazz: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.5.8/api/zlib.html
[21:51] CoverSlide: native zlib?
[21:51] dominicbarnes has left the channel
[21:52] bnoordhuis: djazz: you'll have to read the source from now
[21:52] djazz: i have a string of binary data that i want to decompress
[21:52] djazz: ok
[21:52] bnoordhuis: CoverSlide: we ship zlib + bindings in master
[21:52] djazz: :P
[21:52] smathy: djazz… oh, in 0.5
[21:52] bnoordhuis: r04r: can you turn that into a test case?

[21:54] r04r: bnoordhuis: I'm not sure how to do that, to be honest.
[21:54] bnoordhuis: r04r: a standalone script that demonstrates the behaviour, with no dependencies on third-party modules
[21:55] r04r: bnoordhuis: Ah, sure. I'll get to that tomorrow if I haven't figured it out by then

[22:19] Tobbe: I have "res.local('error', 'some error'); return exports.edit(req, res);" in one of my route paths. Then in exports.edit I do "console.log(res.locals.error)" and that gives me "undefined". Why? I was expecting "some error"
[22:19] Tobbe: (this is expressjs)
[22:20] darshanshankar has joined the channel
[22:21] tjholowaychuk: Tobbe 2.x uses res._locals internally, res.locals({ object of locals }) merges into that
[22:21] sfoster has joined the channel
[22:21] tjholowaychuk: but in 3.x res.locals is a function, but the props will be stored on the function
[22:21] tjholowaychuk: locals are for the template though
[22:22] tjholowaychuk: there's usually no need to access them other than in a template
[22:22] dreamdust has joined the channel
[22:23] Tobbe: tjholowaychuk: I'm using 2.4.6
[22:23] tjholowaychuk: yeah, 3.0 is not done
[22:23] djazz has left the channel
[22:24] Tobbe: so how should I access my locals? (for debug printouts)
[22:24] tjholowaychuk: in a template you could just do (with ejs for example) <% console.log(locals) %>
[22:24] tjholowaychuk: jade: - console.log(locals)
[22:27] Tobbe: can I automatically make the locals "globals" instead? so I can use foobar instead of locals.foobar?
[22:27] EvRide has joined the channel
[22:27] CoverSlide: just stick it on the req object
[22:27] janne has joined the channel
[22:27] tjholowaychuk: Tobbe that's what they are
[22:27] CoverSlide: it gets passed down through your middleware like normal
[22:27] tjholowaychuk: Tobbe you dont need to do locals.foo
[22:29] gut4 has joined the channel
[22:29] AvianFlu has joined the channel
[22:29] neilk_ has joined the channel
[22:31] Tobbe: tjholowaychuk: not working. console.log(res._locals) prints { error: 'some error' }. p= locals gives me [Object object] in my view, p= error and p= locals.error are both blank
[22:31] erichynds has joined the channel
[22:32] tjholowaychuk: Tobbe error should certainly be there then
[22:32] tjholowaychuk: not much i can do without seeing code
[22:32] Tobbe: I'll paste it up for you, how much do you need?
[22:32] CoverSlide: try p=error
[22:33] CoverSlide: oh
[22:33] CoverSlide: wtf
[22:33] sonnym has joined the channel
[22:33] brion has joined the channel
[22:33] tjholowaychuk: Tobbe sounds like they're not merging with res.render() locals for some reason, might be worth doing a quick step through with the debugger
[22:33] CoverSlide: i need to actually read more than one line before I respond
[22:33] tjholowaychuk: perhaps some plugin you're using
[22:33] tjholowaychuk: is messing with it
[22:33] tjholowaychuk: i dont have time to look at it right now but ping me later
[22:34] jocafa: https://github.com/dannycoates/node-inspector
[22:35] Tobbe: tjholowaychuk: looking at - console.log(locals) tells me that it is merging, i.e. error is in there, but it's value is "undefined"
[22:35] tjholowaychuk: right

[22:36] innociv: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.3.1/api/url.html There is nothing that gets the path name but not the file name?

[22:40] bingomanatee_: levi: controversial question - has a lot to do with use case. 
[22:41] enmand_ has joined the channel
[22:43] bingomanatee_: as a very very shallow rule, couch is probably better for strongly rest-centric work, mongo has more flexible system of queries, and for logging - but there are so many other variables that its really not easy to declare either system to be universally better or worse - they share some of the same strengths. 
[22:43] levi: No, I mean do you prefer the things you sit on or the people from Mongolia?  It was a silly attempt at a joke.
[22:43] joshkehn has joined the channel
[22:43] CoverSlide: :o
[22:43] innociv: CoverSlide, a little wonky but got me what I needed. Thanks.
[22:43] bingomanatee_: I like CoverSlide's joke better. 
[22:44] CoverSlide: if i make a library for mongo, I must call it candygram
[22:44] bingomanatee_: That would be a good name for a REST broker for Mongo.
[22:44] innociv: to get the hostname+dir i used "nodeUrl.parse(socket.handshake.headers.referer).hostname + nodePath.dirname( nodeUrl.parse(socket.handshake.headers.referer).pathname )"
[22:44] levi: I admit I am not much of a comedian.
[22:44] bingomanatee_: yes you are bad at it
[22:45] levi: Thanks for pointing that out.  You're a swell guy.

[23:07] halcyon918: hey folks, anyone have any experience with amqp? I'm seeing the exchange created in RabbitMQ (although the callback doesn't get triggered), but the Queue isn't created.  I have debugged through the code with the profile and I can see each call being executed (create exchange, create queue, subscribe to queue, etc), but after creating the exchange, nothing else seems to take...

[23:22] franksalim_: halcyon918: i have experience with amqp (but not with the node package). can you run rabbitmqctl list_queues? can you see the wire traffic (with wireshark, for instance)?
[23:22] joshkehn has joined the channel
[23:23] halcyon918: franksalim_ I'm looking at the rabbitmq management console (web) and it shows only the default queues
[23:23] joshkehn has left the channel
[23:23] halcyon918: franksalim: I haven't tested to see if the call to create the queues is being made, but the call to create the exchange goes through
[23:24] franksalim: halcyon918: i would look at the wire traffic to make sure the create queue command is coming out of your client
[23:24] franksalim: or just assume that it isn't
[23:24] nibblebot has joined the channel
[23:24] Druide has joined the channel
[23:24] franksalim: and try to create the queue from another client to see that work
[23:25] halcyon918: well, it'a all localhost... I can try manually creating the queue through the web admin, I suppose
[23:25] Dmitrijus: franksalim: actually, just try to create it from teh management console
[23:25] Dmitrijus: franksalim: may be a permission problem
[23:26] brianseeders has joined the channel
[23:26] halcyon918: franksalim: making it through the console works, apparently
[23:26] franksalim: Dmitrijus: it could be a permission problem, but i wouldn't expect that with default configuration
[23:27] franksalim: Dmitrijus: so i expect it is an API usage problem
[23:27] Dmitrijus: franksalim: oh, sorry, it's halcyon918 :)
[23:27] halcyon918: Dmitrijus: np :)
[23:27] halcyon918: I just took the examples from https://github.com/postwait/node-amqp
[23:28] halcyon918: strangely, the callback functions don't fire, even for the exchange call, which does get created successfully
[23:28] errordeveloper: isaacs: hm .. I can see that not all packages have a repo entry, e.g. http://search.npmjs.org/#/qs
[23:28] isaacs: errordeveloper: that's true
[23:29] errordeveloper: isaacs: hence not all can be installed as submodules, can't this be fixed ?
[23:29] franksalim: Dmitrijus: that's ok :)
[23:29] isaacs: errordeveloper: send the author a pull request and bug them to publish it

[23:30] Dmitrijus: franksalim: also, try retasting rabbitmq, it's actually quite buggy
[23:30] Dmitrijus: again, halcyon918 :)
[23:30] halcyon918: heh... ok
[23:30] Dmitrijus: restarting
[23:30] indexzero has joined the channel
[23:30] Dmitrijus: halcyon918: and if you just need simple messaging, zeromq might be a lot better choice :)
[23:31] franksalim: Dmitrijus: I'll restart my rabbit instance for solidarity
[23:31] tjd has left the channel
[23:31] errordeveloper: isaacs: another thing .. I keep getting errors like this - https://gist.github.com/1263151
[23:31] halcyon918: Dmitrijus: well, simply for a prototype would be ok, but I need to do a load test with some business rules
[23:33] AphelionZ has joined the channel
[23:34] halcyon918: Dmitrijus: restarting didn't help... I'll have to do like franksalim suggested and make sure the actual call is being made
[23:36] errordeveloper: isaacs: ok, yeah .. I should complain to GH perhaps, if I were to maintain the npm registry I would just `sed 's:https\://github.com/:http\://github.com/'`
