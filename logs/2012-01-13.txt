[02:26] JasonSmith: isaacs: tap question? "The plan cannot appear in the middle of the output, nor can it appear more than once." http://testanything.org/wiki/index.php/TAP_specification#The_plan
[02:26] nerdfiles1 has left the channel
[02:26] JasonSmith: I've been planning willy-nilly without too many problems. What gives?
[02:26] isaacs: JasonSmith: node-tap i think does the right thing
[02:27] isaacs: JasonSmith: it doesn't output a plan line in the middle of tests.
[02:27] JasonSmith: I got the impression that you may only plan() once per *file*
[02:27] meso has joined the channel
[02:27] isaacs: JasonSmith: node-tap lets you call .plan() on any test anywhere.  nested tests can also have plans.
[02:27] isaacs: this is fine:
[02:28] isaacs: tap.plan(1); tap.test("parent", function (t) { t.plan(2); t.pass("ok"); t.test("child", function (t) { t.plan(1); t.pass("kid's alright.") }) })
[02:28] JasonSmith: right, that's what I do. But that's my point. Isn't that nonstandard because you are outputing multiple 1..N lines per test file?
[02:28] isaacs: a t.test() is treated as one "thing" for the purpose of the plan
[02:28] isaacs: no, i still only output a single 1..N at the top level.
[02:29] r04r has joined the channel
[02:29] isaacs: i just juggle it all internally
[02:29] tilgovi has joined the channel
[02:29] isaacs: and adjust the numbers as needed.
[02:29] JasonSmith: isaacs: Awesome, love it. I am acutally using node-tap's runner to run the couch tests these days
[02:29] isaacs: so, in that result, the actual tap output will be 1..2
[02:29] JasonSmith: right
[02:29] isaacs: oh, nice
[02:30] isaacs: JasonSmith: if you throw a text stream at TapConsumer, and it does 1..N more than once, then it'll bark at you.
[02:30] JasonSmith: I am also literally using node-tap's runner
[02:30] isaacs: (well, it'll emit a failing test for that)
[02:30] JasonSmith: right
[02:30] isaacs: or if you do a plan in the middle of tests
[02:31] isaacs: but other than that, and a few other little things, it's remarkably forgiving.
[02:31] cmr: isaacs: Do you have any comments about my most recent commits in the pull request for checking executability of a script before running it?
[02:31] isaacs: you can emit no tests or tap output, and just exit 0, and it'll call that a success
[02:31] isaacs: cmr: didn't get to that yet.
[02:31] JasonSmith: isaacs: yeah that's what it does on my harness files :)

[02:32] isaacs: JasonSmith: i detect a facetious air.

[02:33] brngardner has joined the channel
[02:33] cmr: I also considered adding a test for existence of shebangs.
[02:33] isaacs: cmr: that's not correct.
[02:33] isaacs: cmr: it has to be one big conditional.
[02:33] isaacs: cmr: because, 0650 is a valid mode.
[02:34] isaacs: ie, not user executable, but it is group-executable.
[02:34] jacobolus has joined the channel
[02:34] isaacs: if you're the owner, you can't execute it, but if you are in the group, well, then you CAN execute it.
[02:34] isaacs: your code will abort there.
[02:34] JasonSmith: I just want .tapignore
[02:34] cmr: Or just not using else-if
[02:34] JasonSmith: or tap --ignore
[02:35] isaacs: cmr: also, if it masks against 0100, and you don't have process.getuid, then assume that it is executable.
[02:35] isaacs: (ie, windows)
[02:36] cmr: isaacs: Alright, I'll refactor that.
[02:36] cmr: Thanks for the feedback, much appreciated.
[02:36] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[02:36] cmr: isaacs: how do you propose I add tests for that?

[02:37] isaacs: cmr: meh.
[02:37] isaacs: i dunno.
[02:37] isaacs: i guess just put a non-executable file in the tests/ folder?
[02:37] isaacs: that doesn't end in .js
[02:37] cmr: Well I've already done that, but that doesn't test the permissions very well.

[02:38] Sir_Rai: Hi guys, im a bit confuse about the managing  modules with npm,it is supossed to be installed all of them globally or locally for each project?

[02:48] ZohoGorganzola: after about an hour pulling my hair out and frantically googling, i just realize that you have to run npm install in the root of your home directory (~/) in order for it to work, everywhere else it throws errors about not being able to find package.json and then it can't resolve any dependencies when you actually run node
[02:48] khrome has joined the channel
[02:48] cmr: ZohoGorganzola: Huh? For what?
[02:48] ZohoGorganzola: for anything to work
[02:48] cmr: You should run npm install in the root of a project.
[02:49] ZohoGorganzola: i tried that
[02:49] cmr: Not your home directory.
[02:49] ZohoGorganzola: and i kept getting errors
[02:49] cmr: Then your node is broken.

[04:49] cmr: Reuse the socket, of course.
[04:49] cainus: anyone happen to know a nice way to get the request body in express?  I wrote a middleware to do it, but that seems more complicated than it should be...

[05:20] jesusabdullah: and then there's the "slow" ones that for whatever reason do something that javascript doesn't like. Maybe it has a lot of features, or maybe it uses the dom.

[05:21] jesusabdullah: and on the server, well, you need to have a dom too and jsdom is not that fast
[05:21] cmr: Why is the DOM so fast. Is it because it just is, or is it because the implementations suck?

[06:08] jesusabdullah: It's one of those sort of no-longer-indie kinda things
[06:08] pquerna: perhaps.
[06:08] jesusabdullah: is why I think people rag on it
[06:08] torvalamo: is it no longer hip to be indie?
[06:08] jesusabdullah: like, if you're in PNW there are soo many undaground microbrews
[06:09] pquerna: :-/
[06:09] jesusabdullah: Yeah, I don't care, I think it's a fine beer
[06:09] jesusabdullah: but you know how beer people are
[06:09] martin_sunset has joined the channel
[06:09] torvalamo: drunk?
[06:09] jesusabdullah: yes
[06:09] pquerna: this is like my tweet this weekend, javascript is too popular, switching to lua, but aplied to beer
[06:09] pquerna: some people thought i was serious
[06:09] jesusabdullah: js is mainstream now
[06:10] torvalamo: it's dash next?
[06:10] torvalamo: whatever it is
[06:10] jesusabdullah: naw dude, lua
[06:10] pquerna: but the trick was, i actually was serious, https://github.com/luvit/luvit
[06:10] pquerna: its a double mind trick :|
[06:10] jesusabdullah: sure, sure
[06:11] zivester has joined the channel
[06:11] torvalamo: so you tricked both them AND yourself?
[06:11] satyr has joined the channel

[06:12] Tiger_: Sorry, Where Can I download the source code of this site? and i want to study Node.js
[06:12] jesusabdullah: what site?
[06:12] polotek: I'm actually surprised luvit hasn't gained a little following
[06:12] isaacs: polotek: "engines": { "node": "0.4 || 0.6" }
[06:13] isaacs: polotek: npm help semver <-- helpful stuff in there
[06:13] pquerna: polotek: it has a tiny following, and on classes, luvit is kinda establishing a set of prototype-like classes / util.inherits
[06:13] Tiger_: This website
[06:13] jesusabdullah: http://love2d.org/ That plus luvit = ?
[06:13] jesusabdullah: what website?
[06:13] torvalamo: Tiger_, github.com/joyent/node
[06:13] Tiger_: oh,my
[06:13] cmr: Tiger_: there is no website here, this is IRC
[06:13] jesusabdullah: irc is not a web site
[06:13] torvalamo: maybe he's using a webchat of sorts
[06:13] jesusabdullah: probably
[06:13] polotek: pquerna: yeah the class thing was sarcasm
[06:14] polotek: isaacs: I've read it. still managed to screw it up
[06:14] isaacs: heh

[06:15] real_mjr has joined the channel
[06:16] Xenadi: anyone able to help with issues on here?
[06:16] airandfingers: what are the most commonly-used methods of linking a node application to a database?
[06:16] airandfingers: i see couchdb a lot
[06:16] deoxxa: Xenadi: not if you don't tell us what they are :)
[06:16] abraxas: airandfingers: mongo seems pretty popular
[06:16] deoxxa: airandfingers: i find myself using mongodb pretty often
[06:16] airandfingers: hm, 2 for mongo
[06:16] Xenadi: i cant run the example http server on my windows 7 box, but my old as all hell windows xp laptop works fine
[06:16] airandfingers: i saw that on nodetuts, haven't seen the video though
[06:16] cmr: I've been sniffing around redis.
[06:16] cmr: Seems, alright
[06:16] airandfingers: http://nodetuts.com/tutorials/21-nodejs-mongodb-and-mongoose-11.html#video
[06:16] abraxas: airandfingers: i use membase a lot
[06:16] catshirt has joined the channel
[06:17] cmr: Xenadi: What code are you using, what version of node?
[06:17] airandfingers: hmm, what are their relative advantages? (or how can i find that out myself)
[06:17] abraxas: cmr: I love the redis api.. but very concerned (don't know enough about this yet) about the data persistence
[06:17] Xenadi: 0.6.7 and the example from the main page http://nodejs.org
[06:18] abraxas: airandfingers: membase is a key/value store based on the memcached api, so scaling is insanely easy, but query abilities are limited
[06:18] cmr: Xenadi: from the msi installer?
[06:18] Xenadi: i can log to the console without any issues, but my browser doesnt connect
[06:18] Xenadi: yes
[06:18] Xenadi: same installer worked fine on my laptop and on my mates win 7 box
[06:18] deoxxa: airandfingers: mongoose adds a lot of functionality on top of mongodb, functionality that you may or may not need - personally i just use the regular old mongodb api
[06:19] airandfingers: @deoxxa how is mongodb in terms of query expressibility and ease-of-use?
[06:19] Tiger_: I am come in through the website(http://webchat.freenode.net),what about you ?
[06:20] Xenadi: i should also mention im running win 7 x64
[06:20] airandfingers: @abraxas hm, sounds pretty simple.. maybe membase would be a good place to start, how does it compare to couchdb?
[06:20] deoxxa: airandfingers: pretty good, the queries are just regular JSON so they map directly to javascript objects
[06:20] airandfingers: hm sorry, i'm using the wrong syntax for replying ^^
[06:20] cmr: Tiger_: I'm using weechat. freenode's webchat uses qwebirc, the source is at http://hg.qwebirc.org/qwebirc/src
[06:20] abraxas: airandfingers: membase is no more than simple key/value, so you can't do any scans
[06:21] abraxas: airandfingers: if you don't need scans, just key/value, membase is wonderful
[06:21] abraxas: airandfingers: although admittedly, redis has a much more powerful api
[06:21] airandfingers: abraxas: so why use membase over redis, then?
[06:22] abraxas: airandfingers: redis has not yet convined me of safe and realtime persistent storage
[06:22] Tiger_: ook!thanks! i get it! sorry ,my english is poor~ :)
[06:22] abraxas: airandfingers: but i'm not informed enough about redis, i need to learn more about it
[06:22] nickdc has left the channel
[06:23] airandfingers: abraxas: i see.. i recognize redis from the 
[06:23] airandfingers: abraxas: "most depended on" list of npm packages
[06:23] mattgifford has joined the channel
[06:24] abraxas: airandfingers: it's very popular
[06:24] airandfingers: deoxxa: sounds good.. what does mongo interface with? do you have to install a database or ubuntu package like couchdb?
[06:24] cmr: airandfingers: mongodb IS a database
[06:24] deoxxa: yep, it's a database server
[06:25] airandfingers: so the npm package actually installs the database server, or the package is just an interface to it, and you have to install it with aptitude (or something)?
[06:25] deoxxa: the latter
[06:25] cmr: airandfingers: yes, you need mongodb installed and running
[06:25] airandfingers: got it.. so similar to couchdb
[06:25] maletor has joined the channel
[06:25] jesusabdullah: sort of
[06:25] deoxxa: mongodb is a database server, just like couchdb, mysql, etc etc
[06:25] cmr: Similar to most databases.
[06:25] airandfingers: couchdb gave me all kinds of trouble though @@ aptitude kept installing version 0.11
[06:26] jesusabdullah: couchdb has an http interface
[06:26] airandfingers: but not similar to redis and/or membase?
[06:26] cmr: Similar to redis, yes.
[06:26] cmr: I don't know about membase.
[06:26] deoxxa: they fall under the "etc"
[06:26] jesusabdullah: well, there are families of these kind of
[06:27] airandfingers: hm, how about mongodb vs redis? sounds like mongo is more fully-featured, redis is simpler?
[06:27] jesusabdullah: Here's my impression of nosql databases:
[06:27] hdms_o has joined the channel
[06:27] deoxxa: they both have different uses
[06:27] jesusabdullah: First, there are the group of them that were like, "man sql kinda sucks let's do something better"
[06:27] jesusabdullah: I think couchdb falls in that bucket, for example
[06:27] Yooman has left the channel
[06:27] airandfingers: deoxxa: can you describe those different uses, if you wouldn't mind? O:)
[06:28] jesusabdullah: it's a document datastore with an http/json api, pretty wild
[06:28] hdms_o has left the channel
[06:28] airandfingers: yeah that was something different, and quite a ride
[06:28] jesusabdullah: Then, there are the guys that were like, "I love sql brah but it jist doesn't scale"
[06:28] Xenadi: anyone with windows + node experience? - having issues with the http example
[06:28] jesusabdullah: just*
[06:28] total_ has joined the channel
[06:28] jesusabdullah: and mongodb and other databases are kinda like this
[06:28] jesusabdullah: hbase?
[06:29] jesusabdullah: the point is that they have these sort of sql-influenced dsl's (in mongo's case an edsl with javascript) for doing queries
[06:29] jesusabdullah: but use mapreduce techniques, etc. underneath for mad scaling yo
[06:29] jesusabdullah: couch's concept of scaling is great but I don't think it was really written with this in mind
[06:30] jesusabdullah: not in the same way as some of these others
[06:30] Yooman has joined the channel
[06:30] airandfingers: mkay, so i'll check out mongo and redis, maybe others, but what are your impressions of those two, as compared to the others?
[06:30] jjd has joined the channel
[06:30] airandfingers: (already tried and gave up on couchdb)
[06:30] cmr: airandfingers: Is your data relational?
[06:30] jesusabdullah: there are others too that were basically just like, "let's implement this bigtable stuff and make it fast and awesome"
[06:30] airandfingers: yes
[06:30] cmr: Then use a relational database.
[06:30] jesusabdullah: and like, redis and riak and stuff like that is like that
[06:31] jesusabdullah: airandfingers: I like couch a lot actually
[06:31] cmr: Don't bother with mongo, redis, etc. Go with postgres or sqlite.
[06:31] jesusabdullah: mongo's also popular amongst noders
[06:31] Druide_ has joined the channel
[06:31] jesusabdullah: I think if you think mongo sounds more pleasant to work with than sql then you should do that, personally
[06:31] jesusabdullah: same with couch
[06:32] jesusabdullah: but if sql fits you might as well
[06:32] airandfingers: hm, well maybe i should ask what you mean by "relational".. i interpreted that as "composed of different objects that are related to each other" (typical sql database style)
[06:32] jesusabdullah: yeah, that's what that means
[06:32] jesusabdullah: with mapreduce you don't have to have a schema in the same way
[06:32] airandfingers: well i have sql experience, and i'm frustrated with all the new things i'm having to learn to use node (express, jade, node itself, etc)
[06:32] jesusabdullah: usually you just have keys and values
[06:33] jesusabdullah: well, it's a new stack yo, of course it'll take some time and effort
[06:33] airandfingers: i mean you could structure data any way you like.. but maybe my mind is inclined to think in relational terms
[06:33] jesusabdullah: You don't have to learn jade if you don't want to fwiw
[06:33] JackNorris has joined the channel
[06:33] jesusabdullah: and you certainly don't *have* to jump into the nosql pool
[06:33] airandfingers: yeah that's true, i thought i did because of the nodetuts i watched
[06:33] airandfingers: ^^
[06:33] cmr: ACTION dislikes jade
[06:33] jesusabdullah: look around for some sql libraries and call it a day ;)
[06:33] airandfingers: ^^
[06:34] airandfingers: i'll save the nosql jump for later on, i guess
[06:34] jesusabdullah: Honestly, *my* problem is that I can never figure out how to get an sql server running and configured
[06:34] jesusabdullah: Yeah dude
[06:34] yogig has joined the channel
[06:34] jesusabdullah: mapreduce is a way cool thing
[06:34] airandfingers: i see
[06:34] jesusabdullah: as is being able to treat your database as a webserver (couch does this)
[06:35] polotek: airandfingers: the pg module for postgres is nice
[06:35] jesusabdullah: Oh, is it? Good to hear :)
[06:35] Hanspolo has joined the channel
[06:36] Tiger_: Excuse me,Is there any way can make the Node.js support sleep() ? To unload the cpu?
[06:36] Margle has joined the channel
[06:36] RLa: Tiger_, use setTimeout and callbacks
[06:36] polotek: Tiger_: no
[06:36] polotek: :)
[06:36] githogori has joined the channel
[06:37] polotek: You don't want to sleep, you want to use a callback
[06:37] cmr: Tiger_: Node doesn't busy loop so don't sorry about it.
[06:37] airandfingers: i mean, if you _really_ wanted to, you _could_ make it busy loop
[06:37] airandfingers: but it's better to learn to think in terms of callbacks
[06:37] torvalamo: if you're a sadist
[06:38] Tiger_: but i can't unload the cpu
[06:38] airandfingers: yep, sleeps are a bad idea
[06:38] cmr: Tiger_: Don't worry about it, the OS will do it for you
[06:38] Tiger_: i mean use the "busy loop"
[06:38] jesusabdullah: Tiger_: it happens implicitly
[06:38] jesusabdullah: What you probably want to do is something like,
[06:38] torvalamo: it won't just loop when nothing happens
[06:38] torvalamo: well, it will, but it doesn't cost anything
[06:39] zivester has joined the channel
[06:39] airandfingers: bleh.. so, recommendations for sql npm packages? ^^
[06:39] airandfingers: i heard your pg, polotek
[06:39] cmr: Postgres is very nice.
[06:39] jesusabdullah: (function doThingEveryFewSeconds() { setTimeout(function () { doThing(); doThingEveryFewSeconds(); }, 2000); })()
[06:39] jesusabdullah: Like that
[06:39] polotek: node-mysql is pretty standard
[06:39] airandfingers: sounds about right
[06:39] airandfingers: how about sqlite?
[06:40] torvalamo: node-sqlite3
[06:40] torvalamo: or something
[06:40] cmr: I like sqlite because I don't need to setup a server.
[06:40] jesusabdullah: I don't think they ever made it non-blocking though
[06:40] polotek: yes, use sqlite3
[06:40] cmr: jesusabdullah: they did
[06:40] jesusabdullah: oh?
[06:40] polotek: there are some other ones, but they're not so good in my experience
[06:40] jesusabdullah: Awesome!
[06:40] cmr: I don't know about node-sqlite3 in specific but there is a non-blocking version available.
[06:40] Tiger_: just want to do  Ajax long-pulling
[06:40] cmr: Yeah, it's async.
[06:41] airandfingers: i don't see node-mysql, but i see references to it in other packages..mysql-helperSimple wrapper for felixge's node-mysql
[06:41] polotek: Tiger_: actually you wanna use socket.io :)
[06:41] satyr has joined the channel
[06:41] torvalamo: sqlite is like any sql, except it doesn't give a shit about types
[06:41] torvalamo: :P
[06:41] torvalamo: is the short story
[06:41] jesusabdullah: also, file system
[06:41] torvalamo: and it stores in a local file
[06:41] torvalamo: yeah
[06:42] deoxxa: ha, gistdb is pretty cool
[06:42] mikeal has joined the channel
[06:42] airandfingers: should i be searching for packages at http://search.npmjs.org/ ?

[06:43] airandfingers: right, pretty much the same thing?
[06:43] polotek: airandfingers: http://toolbox.no.de/
[06:43] cmr: Also see http://toolbox.no.de/
[06:43] airandfingers: thanks!
[06:43] Tiger_: polotek: socket.io? but Browser support socket? i just know the html5 suport browser can do
[06:44] cmr: Tiger_: socket.io falls back to other transports besides websockets.
[06:44] deoxxa: if only there was a website for socket.io that explained this
[06:44] deoxxa: something like maybe http://socket.io/
[06:44] polotek: socket.io even works in your mom's web browser

[10:10] spolu: Hi all, I have a proxy server which I use to connect to an nginx http server and retrieve html.

Anybody would have any clue on how to avoid that?

[10:17] deoxxa: so preq times out, somehow?
[10:17] spolu: deoxxa: that's my guess
[10:17] spolu: deoxxa: or the underlying pooled connection
[10:18] deoxxa: sounds like the req#data event might not be firing
[10:18] deoxxa: or req#end
[10:18] deoxxa: that'd be what i'd look at first, anyway
[10:18] shinuza has joined the channel
[10:19] mara has joined the channel
[10:19] spolu: deoxxa: req.data is never fired (I do only GET in that use case)

[10:19] deoxxa: but req#end is?
[10:19] niloy has joined the channel
[10:19] cmr: I see that syntax everywhere. What does req#end mean, exactly?
[10:19] cmr: Well, "everywhere" as in docs mostly.
[10:20] mara has joined the channel
[10:20] deoxxa: object#event
[10:20] cmr: Ahhhhh.
[10:20] cmr: That's really convenient.
[10:20] spolu: deoxxa: well that might not be the case but that would mean that all request would hang up, only here it happens only once very minute for 50 different incoming request
[10:20] TimTim has joined the channel
[10:20] deoxxa: var req = http.request(config); req.on("data", cb); << req#data
[10:21] deoxxa: spolu: does it happen for all requests? or only some? and if it's only some, is it always the same ones?
[10:21] disappea_ has joined the channel
[10:21] spolu: deoxxa: I do a req.end() on the proxy client side
[10:21] deoxxa: and if it's always the same ones, is it also the same ones if you change the order of the requests?
[10:21] spolu: deoxxa: one every 50-60 request
[10:22] yolin has joined the channel
[10:22] spolu: deoxxa: each request is unique 
[10:22] deoxxa: ah
[10:22] spolu: deoxxa: one request every second
[10:22] spolu: deoxxa: always happen on the Xth
[10:22] deoxxa: oh that's interesting
[10:23] spolu: deoxxa: the underlying connection is probably kept alive right?
[10:23] spolu: deoxxa: if nginx timeout that keep alive connection every minute or so
[10:23] deoxxa: hmm iirc the default node http client doesn't support pipelining, so there'd be no reason to have it stay open
[10:23] spolu: deoxxa: ok
[10:24] deoxxa: that was a while ago i heard that though, it may have changed
[10:24] deoxxa: ah, no, it does do keep-alive now
[10:24] spolu: deoxxa: right
[10:24] tytsim has joined the channel
[10:25] spolu: deoxxa: so I guess the nginx server just decide to close it after some time (as it's kind of unusual to have such a long keep-alived connection)
[10:25] deoxxa: yeah
[10:25] spolu: deoxxa: so I'd like to force my agent to recycle connection every 30s
[10:26] spolu: deoxxa: maybe I can set the req.connection.timeout
[10:26] spolu: or the request.timeout
[10:27] spolu: or maybe try a setKeepAlive(true)
[10:27] disappearedng has joined the channel
[10:27] spolu: since the timeout is enforced only when the connection is inactive...

[12:47] Industrial: there has to be a code pattern for the easiest solution for this
[12:47] robde has joined the channel
[12:47] Industrial: because I'm working on a big project and can't just introduce another lib

[12:47] deoxxa: you keep track of the number of callbacks
[12:47] deoxxa: you decrement that number at the end of each operation
[12:48] deoxxa: once it reaches zero, you call the final callback

[13:25] Xenadi: so u want me to try something like http://127.0.0.1:1337/blah?blah=true
[13:25] Xenadi: that doesnt work either, just says connecting
[13:26] icebox: Xenadi: no... I was wondering if the server is  started correctly
[13:26] texinwien: Xenadi: When you started the server, did you see the 'server running' message?
[13:26] Xenadi: yes
[13:26] Xenadi: server running at http://127.0.0.1:1337/
[13:26] texinwien: huh. worked flawlessly for me. wish I could help.
[13:26] Xenadi: its a copy paste of the example scrpt on the main page

[13:27] Xenadi: xampp works fine on the same box
[13:27] icebox: Xenadi: here w7 
[13:27] Xenadi: even the same port
[13:27] icebox: Xenadi: w7 64 bit
[13:27] Xenadi: yes 64bit
[13:28] icebox: Xenadi: Chaneg the port, as a try
[13:28] texinwien: am thinking some kind of security - where you had to 'allow' xampp when you installed it, and will have to allow node, as well.
[13:28] Xenadi: done, same thing
[13:28] Xenadi: well windows firewall is disabled, UAC disabled, no other firewalls on the system
[13:29] Xenadi: i do have windows security essentials installed, but my laptop has that too, and no issues

[13:38] icebox: texinwien: you need to know the path... as myobj.myobj2.mynesteddobj.name
[13:39] thurmda: Does anyone know how I would start multiple node processes via `npm start`
[13:39] Xenadi: hmm the telnet session is behaving very strangely
[13:39] gbatcisco has joined the channel
[13:39] texinwien: ok, so if mynestedobj is in an array, I'd just need to loop through the array and find the one with obj.name="name I'm looking for"?
[13:40] kuhrt has joined the channel
[13:40] thurmda: What would my package.json scripts.start value be?
[13:40] Xenadi: so i connect and get a blinking cursor, but when i type in GET / i dont see the characters and nothing happens even after i press enter
[13:40] icebox: texinwien: for instance myobj.myobj2.mynesteddobj[2].name
[13:40] cmr: thurmda: you want to start them serially?
[13:41] cmr: thurmda: or all at once?
[13:41] texinwien: yes, but that assumes I know which index in the array has the object I want
[13:41] cmr: texinwien: If you don't know, yes you need to loop
[13:41] texinwien: I'm going the other way - I have an array of objects, and I want to find the one that has a specific name value.

[13:44] texinwien: icebox: OK, thanks. That confirms my 'suspicion'.  The 'standard' way is to loop through.
[13:44] thurmda: but not what I thought
[13:44] texinwien: am using underscore.js for dealing with collections, mostly.
[13:44] texinwien: will probably continue to just rely on that.
[13:44] kuhrt: cmr: ah ok of course, thanks!
[13:44] cmr: thurmda: "node bin/uploadService.js &; ..."
[13:44] Xenadi: also very strange, if i start the script with node debug example.js it looks fine, but my browser gets a message to say remote debugging session already exists

[15:25] myndzi: just looking at the list of templating systems on the nodejs site was like D:
[15:25] cmr: .. for (x in [1, 2, 3]) { print(x); }

[15:25] deoxxa: i really need a live demo thing for ginger
[15:26] myndzi: i gots me sql, nodejs will let me avoid rewriting a bunch of code for validation, if i wind up needing some sort of templating i have a good range to pick from depending on the case
[15:26] myndzi: now i just have to uhh.. write some code, haha
[15:26] cmr: Am I confused about for-in on arrays?
[15:26] myndzi: i was all gung ho about an hour ago, then i woke up i guess
[15:26] joshfinnie has joined the channel
[15:26] AAA_awright: deoxxa: It's the nature of mixing template code and other code that makes it ugly, and slightly-more-difficult to preparse into a DOM structure
[15:27] pauls1: cmr: i had some doubts about for ( i in .. ) when I used it on a few lines some months back but found it worked unexpectedly there. lucky to have stuck to my gut feeling and used an int counter in most other places. thanks for clarifying
[15:27] cmr: pauls1: I'm not certain that I'm right
[15:27] lperrin: pauls1: you can also use forEach
[15:27] pauls1: lperrin: ah yes i use forEach a lot, and async (<3)
[15:28] sriley: well with the index you can then access the value of the array
[15:28] AAA_awright: pauls1: And in any event, you NEED to use for(var i in ...) in regular Javascript. Note "var".
[15:28] pauls1: cmr: well it seems to be working! I actually found this bug appear in two different places over the last few days in unexpected places, so it was kinda boggling at first
[15:28] pauls1: AAA_awright: yep that's what i tend to do in my clientside code
[15:28] ritch has joined the channel
[15:28] sriley: the var doesnt have to appear there, just as long as its scoped correctly (not in global scope)

[15:29] AAA_awright: Normally that doesn't happen, but yeah
[15:29] AAA_awright: pauls1: You especially don't want to be defining a global in server side
[15:30] cmr: Am I wrong about for-in iterating over keys in arrays?
[15:30] deoxxa: AAA_awright: i agree, it breaks html pretty badly. i'm not just using it for html though, it's also going to be used for email templates and some config file templates for stuff at work. it's not an html specific solution, pretty much, so there's probably better options for html-only composition.
[15:30] Neil: Can I specify the name of an npm when publishing?
[15:30] AAA_awright: That would be a better use
[15:30] myndzi: a little side-question that has more to do with js programming in general: would it be obnoxious to "unroll" a number of objects on load (<10) so that the methods all perform very specific, short pieces of code (rather than looping/varying the parameters each time a method is called)?
[15:30] deoxxa: cmr: it does iterate over keys
[15:31] garrensmith has joined the channel
[15:32] insin: things are fiddly in different ways for element-level templates, though

[15:38] MooGoo: tetris isn't exactly the spaziest game out there
[15:39] MooGoo: people have been making tetris clones in JS for like 10 years, they run fine even in IE6
[15:39] myndzi: sure, but it's hard to explain to people who aren't really into tetris what matters and why
[15:39] myndzi: yeah, people have been making TERRIBLE tetris clones in js for years :P
[15:39] MooGoo: all tetris clones are terrible
[15:39] myndzi: 99% of tetris clones fail hard on at least one point, frequently more than that
[15:39] cmr: ACTION still plays the original
[15:39] AAA_awright: deoxxa: Here's a better way to do packages for Node.js and FAR simpler:
[15:39] AAA_awright: $ cat .gitmodules
[15:39] AAA_awright: [submodule "node_modules/jade"]/path = node_modules/jade/url = git://github.com/visionmedia/jade.git/npmname = jade/version = master
[15:40] MooGoo: why no one will make a tetris attack clone is beyond me
[15:40] AAA_awright: Use git submodules, define compatible versions there.
[15:40] myndzi: ha, nintendo already made like four

[15:40] myndzi: they keep rebranding it

[15:40] joshkehn has left the channel
[15:40] MooGoo: considering I've basiclly lost my DS long ago
[15:40] deoxxa: AAA_awright: we use git submodules at work for our in-house code - it's painful
[15:40] myndzi: i took a js/canvas tetris game and fixed it so it didn't sock on most counts, then experimented with the input for extra finesse
[15:41] triptec has joined the channel
[15:41] AAA_awright: cmr: Portage is the best package manager I've used, I use Gentoo on my desktop and four servers
[15:41] napperjabber has joined the channel
[15:41] deoxxa: ACTION understands now
[15:41] myndzi: when i saw how fairly simple the code wound up, i'm more interested now in making canvas/js interface for king of stackers (which is a turn-based tetris game i've done work on)
[15:41] cmr: AAA_awright: I knew that was coming
[15:41] cmr: AAA_awright: Used paludis?
[15:41] myndzi: one of the annoying things about KoS is that it's php in back and js in front, so you have to write most of the code twice or trust the client
[15:41] myndzi: thus, node.js :D
[15:41] AAA_awright: deoxxa: I can't imagine you're using them right... submodules works FAR better than npm, there's absolutely zero configuration
[15:42] myndzi: extra bonus that not only is the code the same, it can be literally inherited from the same file
[15:42] AAA_awright: cmr: Haven't heard of it
[15:42] myndzi: anyway. i know browsers aren't the ideal gaming platform, but i want to do everything within my power...
[15:42] fangel has joined the channel
[15:42] deoxxa: submodules require you to go into each dependent project and update the commit they're pinned to every time you update a depended-on library or module
[15:42] MooGoo: I spent a lot of time optimizing some functions for this canvas demo I was working on, including using new Function to pre compile appropriate functions, as to get rid of needless conditional checks every step of the animation
[15:42] deoxxa: that gets really old, really quick
[15:42] MooGoo: and used bitwise trickiness to speed some things up in some cases
[15:43] deoxxa: so they're definitely not zero configuration
[15:43] myndzi: the most important concern to tetris players is timing accuracy
[15:43] MooGoo: but these days js implamentations do a pretty damn good job on their own
[15:43] myndzi: if you hold down the button for the same amount of time, it needs to be reflected in the game with minimum variance
[15:43] shanebo has joined the channel
[15:43] MooGoo: you should be able to get 60 fps easily, which would be very responsive
[15:43] myndzi: so all the drawing code isn't as important, but the less it runs, the more time there is for the cpu to get other stuff out of the way and respond to a keypress
[15:43] cmr: AAA_awright: it's inspired by portage (is even compatible with ebuilds) but is faster and tons more extensible. Instead of having overlays, repositories are something you can install. Same with system users, instead of having the exheres (equivalent of ebuild) make them itself, it installs it via the normal package manager methods.
[15:44] AAA_awright: deoxxa: That wouldn't be configuration, but even considering it so, I don't EVER have to go into child modules and handle their dependencies
[15:44] myndzi: yeah, i may have said it a bit wrong; consistency is king
[15:44] myndzi: players can deal with 3 frames' lag
[15:44] trotter has joined the channel
[15:44] cmr: AAA_awright: exherbo uses it exclusively
[15:44] cmr: (also available on gentoo)
[15:44] myndzi: but if the DAS varies between 4 and 8 frames, it'll piss em right off
[15:44] myndzi: erm. auto-shift; the "repeat delay" like when you hold a key on your keyboard
[15:44] AAA_awright: deoxxa: It's trivial to work out dependencies automatically without having to do it by hand, thats what Node.js SHOULD be doing
[15:45] myndzi: it's important to fast play :)
[15:45] mlin has joined the channel
[15:45] deoxxa: AAA_awright: say you're using express (or anything else). they update the library, what happens when you next do a build of your dependant project?
[15:45] MooGoo: 3 frame lag at 60fps ~= 48ms ... I'd notice
[15:45] AAA_awright: And then you don't run into the awful global namespace issues
[15:45] MooGoo: but that's just the snes gamer in me..

[15:48] deoxxa: well, the version number is meant to reflect whether or not changes will break compatibility

[15:49] deoxxa: can you do that with submodules? really?
[15:49] AAA_awright: Yeah, it's an extra line in .gitmodules
[15:49] AAA_awright: Now, you have to have the script to resolve those version stuff
[15:49] deoxxa: to check out any tag that matches a certain pattern?

[15:54] cmr: I can't use git submodules then.
[15:54] cmr: And now I suddenly have no way to pull in dependencies but manually.
[15:54] SirFunk: Question: I have a project using nodejs, socket.io and amberjs (client). There are some things that i need to handle asyncroniously from server->client (updating items on bills) and some things that need to be done syncroniously (making sure a payment goes through before moving on to the next 'page'). How would you handle this. A.) use ajax calls from the client to express or something on the server for the syncronious calls? Or B.) pipe
[15:54] SirFunk:  everything through socket.io and have the server send a message back to the client when payment processes successfully and then the client will listen for that and continue?
[15:54] AAA_awright: That's no argument, what if I'm not using npm? I can't use npm tarballs then
[15:55] AAA_awright: You can't argue "Well what if I don't want to adopt the proposed solution" as a reason against the solution :p
[15:55] c4milo: isaacs: yt? I'm having a weird behavior with npm and wanted to double check it with you 
[15:55] cmr: AAA_awright: using git submodules isn't portable across any of the other SCM's somebody might want to use. npm is.
[15:56] AAA_awright: cmr: npm isn't portable against any of the other package managers people might want to use, your argument is invalud
[15:56] cmr: AAA_awright: How so?
[15:56] cmr: All it needs is a package.json
[15:56] AAA_awright: If you don't want to use git as revision control, again, --shallow=1
[15:56] richardr has joined the channel
[15:56] AAA_awright: You can certainly use some other revision control too

[15:58] deoxxa: how exactly is package.json not portable anyway? you could pretty simply publish an npm module to another service...
[15:58] cmr: AAA_awright: Git isn't a package manager, that's the thing.

[16:12] isaacs: AAA_awright: is it open source? on github somewhere?
[16:13] AAA_awright: isaacs: It's a script of mine
[16:15] AAA_awright: That's the one I end up using but I have a number of rewrites with various amounts of semver and npm compatibility disorganized across my systems... If we really want semver support for git submodules I'd imagine it needs ~300 lines plus support libraries for semver, running git commands, and parsing config files
[16:16] AAA_awright: That script is also piped through xargs so it's a bit of a hack
[16:16] isaacs: AAA_awright: semver is already supported by node-semver

[16:18] isaacs: i use them in npm itself, and they're pretty bad, actualy
[16:18] isaacs: the only nice thing is that i can do `npm explore request -- git pull origin master` to update it
[16:18] warz: draginx, it uses the middleware in the order that theyre specified
[16:18] warz: so make sure its prior to the router.

[16:22] cmr: Ohhh
[16:22] AAA_awright: Oh how much did you miss... isaacs: Submodules gives you all your first-level dependencies right there, the only thing needed for Node.js is consolidating submodules to the root path and specify compatible future versions, which I do in .gitmodules, module.package.version=4 or whatnot
[16:22] c4milo: isaacs: we have that in our task list but it isn't something that we can do overnight sadly :/ 
[16:22] cmr: isaacs: Any major new things (or should I see git log)

[16:23] isaacs: c4milo: npm 1.1 has a lot of fixes and good stuff.  mostly driven by windows support, but also this is now free of system tar utilities and their oddnesses.
[16:24] c4milo: isaacs: I see 
[16:24] isaacs: it uses node-tar, so i control the oddness directly :)
[16:24] isaacs: but this requires having a zlib binding.  so, no 0.4 support.
[16:24] isaacs: AAA_awright: that's a nice approach, if you control the world.  if you're trying to push a community to do your work for you, it's often suboptimal, and adds frictional agreement.
[16:25] tjholowaychuk has joined the channel
[16:25] isaacs: AAA_awright: but i still dont' grok why submodules are preferred to just checking your stuff into git.
[16:25] isaacs: AAA_awright: having managed projects for several months that do both, i can say with confidence, submodules are bullshit.
[16:25] isaacs: they ruin pretty much everything that makes git awesome.
[16:25] c4milo: isaacs: yeah I understand node 0.6.x has a lot of improvements but you know, it's hard to move a big code base of a working system overnight, it's a cost that can't happen fast, it has to be something gradual. 
[16:25] c4milo: isaacs: I think I have a workaround 
[16:25] isaacs: c4milo: totally understnad.
[16:25] AAA_awright: isaacs: How does this involve "controlling the world"... Then you run into cmr's problem, how do you keep up-to-date? submodules define a place to look for updates
[16:25] c4milo: in the mean time 
[16:26] pquerna: yes, we are just about to do the 0.6 jump now, hurrah :)
[16:26] isaacs: AAA_awright: easy.  use npm.  nest your deps as necessary to handle cycles and conflicts.  check your node_modules folder into git.
[16:27] AAA_awright: That eliminates everything that's good and right with Git
[16:27] isaacs: AAA_awright: then you have a clear place to look for updates, you have a simpler deploy process, you can float patches if necessary, etc.
[16:27] isaacs: AAA_awright: you get bisect, diffs, etc.  you can see exactly what changed and when.
[16:27] isaacs: there's a reason node bundles v8 and statically links to it.  because it's a downloadable application.
[16:27] isaacs: same with npm's releases.
[16:27] isaacs: ACTION goes off to strip out npm's submodules and put his code where his mouth is...
[16:28] AAA_awright: It's practically forking v8, I can deal with that (barely... the build system I can't)
[16:28] AAA_awright: But also because Google is stupid and doesn't use Git for whatever reason

[16:36] c4milo: that's a fucking virus 
[16:36] isaacs: ohhhh, ok
[16:36] isaacs: no shit.
[16:36] isaacs: you know node-tap has coverage now?
[16:36] c4milo: I'm not using code coverage! 
[16:36] isaacs: it's kind of wonky and experimental, but mostly works.
[16:36] isaacs: oh, then gah!!
[16:36] isaacs: wth?
[16:36] c4milo: and all my tests are now in mocha 
[16:37] boltR has joined the channel
[16:37] isaacs: c4milo: you can also exclude it with a .gitignore

[16:43] isaacs: c4milo: compile on install is kind of awful.
[16:43] c4milo: indeed 
[16:44] isaacs: opens the door for a lot of bad decisions like including spidermonkey in a node test harness.
[16:44] isaacs: if you had to do the compilation up front, you'd never choose to do that.
[16:44] c4milo: isaacs: well, the 193M is mostly normal dependencies, as devdependecies we have only like 5 or 6 modules 
[16:44] deoxxa: wait what
[16:44] deoxxa: spidermonkey?
[16:44] isaacs: c4milo: right, but if a bunch of them use expresso, then you'll have multiple copies.
[16:44] isaacs: deoxxa: YEAH!
[16:44] isaacs: deoxxa: how stupid si that??
[16:44] deoxxa: i'm...
[16:44] deoxxa: what?
[16:45] isaacs: deoxxa: jscoverage uses spidermonkey
[16:45] isaacs: expresso uses jscoverage.
[16:45] isaacs: most expresso users don't use coverage anyway
[16:45] deoxxa: i can't rightly imagine what sequence of decisions led to this outcome

[16:45] c4milo: isaacs: exactly

[16:47] deoxxa: Kiryaka: using socket.io-client on node?
[16:48] isaacs: AvianFlu: OMG I AM SO CLOSE TO FINISHING THIS AMAZINGLY.
[16:48] AvianFlu: well sweet!
[16:48] Kiryaka: deoxxa: using socket.io, not socket.io-client
[16:48] isaacs: AvianFlu: so, if you want to do this, ok, but we should have a conversation about the approach.
[16:48] deoxxa: Kiryaka: so you're accessing it via a browser?
[16:48] AvianFlu: isaacs, people put their main start scripts in their .gitignore sometimes, I'd love to stop them for good!
[16:48] Kiryaka: deoxxa: yup
[16:48] isaacs: AvianFlu: ie, i'd be happy to delegate, but a patch coming out of nowhere has a low likelihood of being acceptable.
[16:49] einaros has joined the channel
[16:49] isaacs: AvianFlu: yeah, the latest npm 1.1 should prevent that.
[16:49] Kiryaka: using socket.io js that's served by socket.io
[16:49] AvianFlu: isaacs, well if you're actually in the middle of it, then carry on
[16:49] isaacs: AvianFlu: since their .gitignore will turn into a .npmignore, and their package will stop working if they don't fix that.

[16:49] AvianFlu: nice
[16:49] deoxxa: ah, can't offer any help then :( Kiryaka - i had a similar problem but it was socket.io-client being incompatible with > 0.4.x node
[16:49] isaacs: AvianFlu: it's been a long ride.
[16:49] Kiryaka: deoxxa: it is compatible
[16:49] Kiryaka: it works with the same install procedure
[16:49] deoxxa: it wasn't before
[16:49] Kiryaka: but on different machines
[16:49] isaacs: AvianFlu: but the pure-js glob impl is just about done now (just need to add a sync version, really) and then the ignorefile module will use that.
[16:49] Kiryaka: can't get what makes it work
[16:50] AvianFlu: isaacs, yeah, I saw you bump 1.1.0 yesterday, congrats

[16:50] AvianFlu: isaacs, cool
[16:50] JarrodBell has left the channel
[16:50] isaacs: AvianFlu: then i'm going to update fstream's dir walker to be ignorefile aware, so you can say "respect the globs in files named 'blah' and skip them"
[16:50] deoxxa: Kiryaka: https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io-client/issues/290 << see
[16:50] isaacs: AvianFlu: the exact api is still somewhat fuzzy.
[16:50] tdegrunt has joined the channel
[16:51] isaacs: AvianFlu: but the target is, "if you have a thing that does things with files, you can use this to ignore certain ones very easily"
[16:51] AvianFlu: isaacs, that's a pretty cool idea
[16:51] isaacs: AvianFlu: i also want to have a .tapignore support for node-tap, so you can exclude tests easily.
[16:51] isaacs: AvianFlu: ti's kind of annoying for me in a few places to have to do this manually.
[16:51] Kiryaka: deoxxa: thank you, but version does not correspond at all :/
[16:51] deoxxa: exactly
[16:51] deoxxa: this is what i was saying ._.
[16:51] AvianFlu: isaacs, yeah, that could be very useful

[16:52] davetayls has joined the channel

[20:19] torvalamo: if socket.io uses xmlhttprequest then they act like normal http requests
[20:19] torvalamo: and go through express
[20:19] torvalamo: no matter what their purpose is
[20:20] torvalamo: as long as the host and port is the same
[20:20] Sembiance: Anyone here do any JSON schema validation with node?
[20:20] draginx: but it shouldnt be using xhr with chrome.... shoukld it?
[20:21] torvalamo: it might
[20:21] torvalamo: i've had it randomly go to long polling on opera 10+
[20:21] torvalamo: for no reason
[20:21] `3rdEden: draginx it depends on many things
[20:21] draginx: ...wow so hmm
[20:21] `3rdEden: maybe you have firewall that blocks websockets
[20:22] torvalamo: should be mentioned that that pc had been on for 4 months straight
[20:22] torvalamo: and was getting rather slow
[20:22] augustl: do most people on OS X use the installer? Or do they compile by hand?
[20:22] `3rdEden: torvalamo also, opera doesn't support websockets, so it indeed falls back to long polling
[20:22] torvalamo: not long polling, i mean script polling
[20:22] `3rdEden: oh
[20:22] torvalamo: like loading script tags
[20:22] `3rdEden: JSONP polling
[20:22] torvalamo: yeah that
[20:22] jbpros has joined the channel
[20:22] draginx: so basically express cant work with socketio l-o-l
[20:23] torvalamo: it can
[20:23] draginx: like... it cant receive information from the client
[20:23] torvalamo: see the article
[20:23] zomg: `3rdEden: Opera supports websockets
[20:23] draginx: if its just an ajax request
[20:23] draginx: ur artticle only sends from server
[20:23] torvalamo: you need to intercept the request
[20:23] draginx: not from client
[20:23] zomg: It's just disabled by default in it due to the security issues present in the older spec
[20:23] zomg: Not sure if they even were addressed though
[20:23] torvalamo: the client is the same
[20:23] `3rdEden: zomg aka, they don't support it
[20:23] jhooks has joined the channel
[20:23] zomg: No, they do...
[20:23] zomg: =)
[20:23] `3rdEden: but the latest opera's do ;P
[20:24] torvalamo: the not yet released one
[20:24] torvalamo: betaish
[20:24] zomg: They could've just implemented Server Sent Events in socketio
[20:24] torvalamo: but they are so weird
[20:25] `3rdEden: zomg I already did that
[20:25] zomg: Did what?
[20:25] torvalamo: it's like "hey you know this web thing?" "yeah" "we've flipped it around"
[20:25] `3rdEden: Server send events
[20:25] zomg: Right, well Opera has supported those pretty long already. Could just have it fall back to that rather than long polling

[20:41] teadict: tuhoojabotti: it isn't for those who don't know...
[20:41] tuhoojabotti: Hehe.
[20:41] torvalamo: did you get redirected?
[20:41] teadict: no, it keeps waiting
[20:41] tuhoojabotti: teadict: It redirects, but tells you that it's not permanent?
[20:41] hotchkiss has left the channel
[20:41] tuhoojabotti: or should redirect
[20:41] torvalamo: does the response have a location header?
[20:41] astropirate has joined the channel
[20:41] stride: teadict: check if the location header is present
[20:41] teadict: I have a redirect in the response, yes
[20:41] teadict: it's a login, redirects to / when done
[20:42] torvalamo: don't use 302
[20:42] teadict: http://paste.ubuntu.com/803389/
[20:42] teadict: (express)
[20:42] teadict: torvalamo: did I?
[20:42] torvalamo: if it says 302 and you did the redirect then yes
[20:43] torvalamo: hm
[20:43] teadict: how do I avoid that?
[20:43] torvalamo: does it actually set 302 as default?
[20:43] torvalamo: that's completely ridiculous
[20:43] teadict: the heck if I know
[20:44] torvalamo: redirect('/', 303)
[20:44] torvalamo: try that
[20:44] broofa has joined the channel
[20:45] torvalamo: 303 is for redirects after an upload, login, or anything else POST-related... it then tells it to send a new request with that location as a GET
[20:45] AndreasMadsen has joined the channel
[20:45] teadict: the afterwards GET ('/') stays pending

[20:46] torvalamo: teadict, can you do a clean GET / ?
[20:47] Aikar: some redirects that try to redirect POST data pops browser confirming to redirect the POST output
[20:47] davetayls has joined the channel
[20:47] torvalamo: no, you deal with the post data first
[20:47] torvalamo: then 303 to whatever page is next
[20:47] torvalamo: which is then a GET page
[20:47] teadict: how would I do that in that code?
[20:48] teadict: instead of res.redirect('/') what?
[20:48] torvalamo: redirect should take a second argument...
[20:48] torvalamo: let me check
[20:49] torvalamo: yeah it does
[20:49] teadict: the http code.. which already tried
[20:49] CrawfordComeaux: my npm-debug.log from "npm install -g socket.io"
[20:49] CrawfordComeaux: my npm-debug.log from "npm install -g socket.io": http://pastebin.com/1VQK3Xq8
[20:50] torvalamo: does it terminate the original request?
[20:50] torvalamo: or response
[20:50] torvalamo: so that it starts clean with a get
[20:50] torvalamo: because if it does then it shouldn't be an issue
[20:50] teadict: in chromes network tab, the post becomes 302 and the afterwards get, the redirect, stays (pending)
[20:51] torvalamo: try redirecting to a different website
[20:51] torvalamo: to test
[20:51] teadict: works

[21:21] SirFunk: I have a project using nodejs, socket.io and amberjs (client). There are some things that i need to handle asyncroniously from server-> client (updating items on bills) and some things that need to be done syncroniously (making sure a payment goes through before moving on to the next 'page'). How would you handle this. A.) use ajax calls from the client to express or something on the server for the syncronious calls? Or B.) pipe  everyth
[21:21] SirFunk: ing through socket.io and have the server send a message back to the client when payment processes successfully and then the client will listen for that before continuing?
[21:22] fermion has joined the channel
[21:22] aheckmann has joined the channel
[21:22] benvie: even the things which require confirmation won't be synchronous
[21:22] benvie: synchronous means the client would be frozen entirely
[21:22] SirFunk: ok, true
[21:22] norviller has joined the channel
[21:23] SirFunk: benvie: but you understand the issue though? what way would you recommend?
[21:24] cole_gillespie has joined the channel
[21:24] benvie: well the one thing I would factor
[21:24] benvie: is the socket connection going through ssl?
[21:24] colinclark has joined the channel
[21:25] benvie: the payment details will need to
[21:25] benvie: I'm guessing you'll just want a standard ajax call for that
[21:25] SirFunk: oh.. i hadn't really thought of that in this case. This is a closed system (non-internet) but that would probably be wise to use just in case
[21:26] benvie: I would separate the payment out probably just because it's a kind of special thing and often requires different treatment
[21:26] benvie: especially security
[21:26] mikeal has joined the channel
[21:27] SirFunk: is it any faster to use socket.io over a rest type http connection ? since the connection is already made?
[21:27] benvie: probably slightly because you're not initiating a new connection
[21:27] SirFunk: hmm
[21:27] benvie: er you would be if not using the socket
[21:28] SirFunk: I'm thinking maybe all of the commands from the client to the server should be resty and the socket.io should just be used to update the clients
[21:28] torvalamo: the cost of initializing a new connection is minimal, a few ms at best, a few tens of ms at worst
[21:28] torvalamo: over local networks, even less
[21:28] SirFunk: yeah, it's local
[21:29] torvalamo: essentially the delay is in your routers
[21:29] benvie: the benefit of the socket is more in being able to control things from the server
[21:29] benvie: like send server-side events
[21:29] SirFunk: yeah
[21:29] benvie: not as much in user initiated events
[21:31] SirFunk: maybe i'll move all the user stuff to ajax.. i think that makes the program logic simpler using jquery's $.ajax with the callbacks right where the request is initiated instead of sending hte socket.io message somehwere and having listeners elsewhere for the response
[21:31] zomg: Adding statistics tracking stuff to my node app... this'll be interesting, I wonder how well will it scale, it is already writing a lot to mongo =)
[21:32] torvalamo: if you just want a one-page webapp (possibly with hash navigation) you might as well just go plain xhr through jquery or angular or ember (if it has it)
[21:32] torvalamo: no need for socket.io
[21:32] torvalamo: socket.io is sweet and all, but it's a bit overkill for some things
[21:33] SirFunk: torvalamo: you talking to me? I'm using ember.. but i need to push updated to the client
[21:33] SirFunk: i need to keep multiple clients in sync
[21:33] torvalamo: oh ok
[21:33] SirFunk: ... what about dnode in the browser.. how does that work? does it use socket underneath?
[21:33] eignerchris_ has joined the channel
[21:33] polotek has joined the channel
[21:34] jesusabdullah: it uses socket.io underneath, yes
[21:34] SirFunk: ahh ok.. might as well just socket then
[21:34] polotek: in node 0.4 are socket errors generally forwarded up to the server instance?
[21:35] polotek: is it best to have error handlers on both the socket and the server?
[21:35] isufy has joined the channel
[21:35] polotek: for net and http servers

[23:06] jbrokc_ has joined the channel
[23:07] jondot2: broofa, had a question i've been wanting to ask you about your uuid implementation
[23:07] jbrokc_ has joined the channel
[23:07] jondot2: you've mentioned that it might be wise to persist the machine id - why?
[23:09] broofa: jondot2 well, I didn't say it would be "wise".  I just state that it's only constant for the lifetime of the JS context, and that future versions may make it more persistent.
[23:09] context has joined the channel
[23:09] jondot2: broofa, excuse for the ignorance but why does it matter?
[23:10] dharmesh has joined the channel
[23:11] broofa: jondot2 From RFC4122, "For UUID version 1, the node field consists of an IEEE 802 MAC
[23:11] broofa:    address" … which means it's really intended to be a constant property of the hardware running the uuid generator.
[23:12] broofa: … but node-uuid doesn't have access to that, so we just generate it randomly.
[23:12] FireFly has joined the channel
[23:13] jondot2: aha. i see, well i'm kinda having a trouble understanding why mac is even needed in this case - or perhaps the spec is referring to a special hardware generating id for crypto or such
[23:13] broofa: (which is allowed for in the spec, but the intent is pretty clear.)
[23:14] broofa: MAC addresses are useful in this context because they are designed to be unique, and controlled by a governing authority.  This means if you have one, you *know* you only have to worry about generating ids unique in the scope of that MAC address… which simplifies the uniqueness problem.
