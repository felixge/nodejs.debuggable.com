[00:00] cmr: Hm
[00:00] cmr: SirFunk: one think you might try, and this may be buggy I don't know, is to "module.exports = new events.EventEmitter()"
[00:00] SirFunk: yeah it seems like the model is bound to being an instance of mongoose.model i don't really know how to 'mixin' EventEmitter
[00:01] cmr: And then copy over all the keys from mongoose.model('Bill') into module.exports
[00:01] cmr: That's the most obvious solution to me. It might not be the cleanest or most correct
[00:01] SirFunk: hmm
[00:02] SirFunk: yeah the model object is pretty big/speciffic . that would be kinda scary :-P
[00:02] cmr: Or you could do it the other way around.
[00:02] SirFunk: that's what i was wondering
[00:03] cmr: You could probably iterate over the object tooo.
[00:03] cmr: However I'm not familiar enough with javascript to know if this is a 'good' thing to do.
[00:03] dubenstein has joined the channel
[00:04] SirFunk: whoa!
[00:04] SirFunk: wait a minute
[00:04] SirFunk: it looks like it may already be an EventEmitter :-P
[00:04] SirFunk: it has .on and .emit functions
[00:04] cmr: Well there you go.
[00:05] SirFunk: haha, let me go test that out
[00:05] eastc: am I correct in stating that mongoose extends mongodb's functionality?
[00:05] cmr: eastc: wraps, not extends, I am pretty sure.
[00:05] cmr: Not positibve
[00:05] SirFunk: eastc: yeah it's an "orm"
[00:06] SirFunk: or.. i guess according to them an ODM
[00:06] salva has left the channel
[00:06] cmr: Document?
[00:06] SirFunk: yup
[00:06] cmr: Mmm
[00:06] SirFunk: it actually does relations TERRIBLY
[00:07] cmr: Makes sense, it wasn't made for that
[00:07] SirFunk: yeah i know.. but it attempts to do relations and does it poorly
[00:07] SirFunk: you can load a model with the related models.. and then if you .remove() one of the relations.. it will remove the related object from the DB but leave it's ID in the list of relations on the original model
[00:08] SirFunk: so like
[00:08] SirFunk: People.Bills[1].remove() .. removes the bill but People still thinks it exists
[00:08] cmr: Yech
[00:09] SirFunk: yup
[00:09] SirFunk: i'm debating why i'm even using it instead of using mongo directly

[00:17] SirFunk: the event never makes it out of the model.. I think that's because i'm listening on the class that makes up the Document but the emit is being emited on the document itself
[00:17] eastc: is mongodb appropriate for user/password login data?
[00:18] flip_digits has joined the channel
[00:18] SirFunk: eastc: i do use it to hold that, no reason why not

[01:45] ZenPSycho has joined the channel
[01:46] ZenPSycho: Okay so some server architecture guy just told me that Node.JS can't scale because of something about a Global Mutex, and queuing theory
[01:46] ZenPSycho: do any of you know what he could have possibly been talking about?
[01:47] ZenPSycho: I tried pressing him for details but he kept dodging and changing the subject
[01:47] MatthewS has joined the channel
[01:48] Aria: Heh. Node doesn't have a global mutex. It's single-threaded.
[01:48] Aria: I think this person was full of it.
[01:49] ZenPSycho: that's what I thought. 
[01:49] Aria: If they had a clue, they'd pick on V8 heap sizes and things like that.
[01:49] Aria: But it's not a matter of 'not scaling' it's a matter of how /to/ scale.
[01:49] Aria: With node? Distribute work.
[01:49] QaDeS has joined the channel
[01:49] Aria: And there's lots of ways to do that. Pass file descriptors to other processes. Load balance across multiple backends.

[01:55] eastc: I'm curious on how to load balance between different node processes...can I use JSON over TCP or is redis a better option? I'm confused
[01:56] torvalamo: you mean how the processes communicate between each other once the load has been balanced? (that sounds dirty
[01:57] brianloveswords has joined the channel
[01:57] eastc: no. just to load balance
[01:57] eastc: I don't know how to connect multiple node processes
[01:57] eastc: basically
[01:57] eastc: or the best way
[01:58] torvalamo: connect them to what?
[01:58] torvalamo: each other?
[01:58] eastc: yea
[01:58] torvalamo: so what i said then
[01:58] eastc: to scale
[01:58] torvalamo: :P
[01:59] eastc: yea i guess lol
[02:00] torvalamo: you can open file descriptors that they share between each other
[02:00] torvalamo: where one writes and one reads continuously
[02:00] torvalamo: and vice versa
[02:01] eastc: so piping between processes
[02:01] eastc: essentially
[02:01] torvalamo: or you can have just one, where every process throws out something it wants someone else to deal with (and a callback address, or something), and then any process that is next in line to read from it, reads that thing and does it and calls back
[02:01] torvalamo: or whatever
[02:02] torvalamo: been a while
[02:03] torvalamo: you can also have a single node process which all other processes connect to, and that one process handles distribution of work
[02:03] torvalamo: that may be the safest way
[02:03] eastc: how can I do that?
[02:03] eastc: ^
[02:03] eastc: last option
[02:04] eastc: like modules running on different processes
[02:04] eastc: and distribute it manually from one process
[02:04] torvalamo: open file descriptors between a process and that one central one
[02:04] torvalamo: that way it's less streams than if every process connected to every other one
[02:04] eastc: ah
[02:04] torvalamo: it's just n processes, instead of n^2
[02:05] eastc: yeah
[02:05] torvalamo: pipes i mean
[02:05] torvalamo: not processes

[02:22] rmoriz: i've updated the gist to show the returned result
[02:22] rmoriz: i need some wrapper around the json that's smart enough to add "," if there are more than one objects 
[02:23] saschagehlich: create an array, called "files"
[02:23] saschagehlich: as soon as file.save is done do files.push(file)

[04:55] bradleymeck: adding a CLI flag will make some things harder since you cannot batch set cli flags (like open up a new shell that is purely for doing stuff in development)

[06:05] benvie: it'll be platform specific and I don't think node has a builtin method for it
[06:05] benvie: on windows you would replace ~ with process.env.HOMEPATH or some such
[06:05] mattkime: hm, platform specific means its different on windows

[06:11] scriptle: Aria, I tried removing db-mysql from node_modules.. ... through npm remove... Still I have the same problem
[06:12] RLa: scriptle, check for another native extensions
[06:12] kmurph79 has joined the channel
[06:12] Aria: Yeah, for sure. Look for .node files
[06:12] Aria: And if not, sounds like you might have a bug in node, or a broken compile of it.
[06:13] scriptle: Oh.. I'm using arch... installed node through pacman .... ! I did not compile it .. ! pacman took care of it
[06:14] stagas has joined the channel
[06:14] RLa: just a guess, but v8::HandleScope seems to be meant for using with automatic memory management
[06:15] RLa: its destructor will be run non-deterministically (not always at the end of scope) if it's not used as variable in method scope
[06:16] RLa: that could cause such bug
[06:16] Aria: Not quite. This is the other end of the use of such a thing: The scope's being closed twice, which means that an extension is passing or getting passed an already-closed scope.

[06:18] scriptle: Hey. One more thing. I tried writing a cpp-module for Nodejs. So compiled a sample helloworld program .. But this folder is not under node_modules folder
[06:18] RLa: hm, can you check such things with some sort of debugger (gdb)?
[06:19] scriptle: I removed the node-cppmodule ... and tried again. Still I get the same error
[06:19] scriptle: gdb ??
[06:20] RLa: i haven't really seriously debugged c++ apps before but i guess you could do it
[06:20] RLa: it might need special build of node tho
[06:21] RLa: with debug info compiled in
[06:23] RLa: you should first try to figure out which extension or node itself causes that error
[06:24] mattgifford has joined the channel
[06:26] scriptle: How do I do that ? I have only one error message that's not even throwing the line number at which the error occured... 
[06:27] Aria: That's where a backtrace comes in handy. gdb would get you one of those
[06:27] Aria: The other trick is trying to make a minimal test case.

[06:34] k1ttty has joined the channel
[06:34] scriptle: whats printfs 
[06:35] Aria: Oh. Derp. "printf debugging" is the general practice of putting your language's output statements in places until you can see what goes wrong.
[06:35] Aria: In node, that's console.log.
[06:35] fangel has joined the channel
[06:35] Aria: So you sprinkle console.log lines in, see if any of them run. Repeat until you find your buggy spot.
[06:35] Aria: Then delve deeper if the cause isn't obvious.
[06:35] scriptle: Ah...
[06:38] cjus has joined the channel
[06:40] scriptle: Will there be a problem importing a module multiple times? Have read that node handles that well .. 
[06:41] RLa: it caches modules
[06:41] RLa: so require('module') will always return same object
[06:41] cjm has joined the channel
[06:42] p3rsist has joined the channel
[06:43] Aria: Unless you muck with the cache yourself.
[06:43] Aria: Like I do in route-watcher
[06:44] RLa: btw, i think caching is also needed for cyclic require
[06:44] RLa: otherwise it would go into loop with that
[06:44] Aria: Yes.
[06:45] RLa: tho with cyclic require you will have more problems, i.e which module should execute first
[06:45] Aria: The one that loads first.
[06:46] Aria: If you have cyclic dependency on the actual execution, things get dicier and you have to invent your own lazy loading techniques.
[06:46] Aria: (like an onReady callback)
[06:46] Aria: but that's rare. Mostly you just need a function exported by the other one at some point later.

[11:44] tuhoojabotti: hz: I suggest node-inspector, it's pretty awsome.
[11:44] martin_sunset: Hz sys was moved to util in node 0.6 (or vice versa) and check out node-inspector

[16:33] pors: bnoordhuis: ah yes, how did I get there? :) Thx
[16:33] zaxx: hi here
[16:33] AndreasMadsen: mmalecki: Also you guys are trying to do terminal isomorfisme (good thinking in general) but I'm not trying to do that, hopeful it will allow me to do more :) 
[16:33] mmalecki: AndreasMadsen: :). we didn't aim at creating a full web framework - you can glue it however you like. but it'd be cool to see something like that created
[16:34] zaxx: anyone has some exp with webworker module? I am totally stuck
[16:34] AndreasMadsen: mmalecki: exactly
[16:34] p1d has joined the channel
[16:34] cmr: zaxx: I recall using a worker module that was broken for node 0.6 and needed some minor patching
[16:34] cmr: But another member of my team was working with it, not me.
[16:35] mmalecki: AndreasMadsen: terminal isomorphism is kind of hard so it's not a major feature
[16:35] LeMike has joined the channel
[16:35] zaxx: cmr: ye i was able to patch it all the way to worker-util.js and now I can't move further, keep getting error around some non-legit object (protocol type) length...

[16:37] zaxx: mmalecki: but that one just runs the child process, i need to pass messages back and forth and I tend to avoid TCP connection, don't want it to get out of kernel to the networking and then back even if thats only on loopb
[16:39] mmalecki: zaxx: hm, I'd go with child_process.fork if spawning child processes is what you need

[16:49] BrianE: How am I *supposed* to handle an exception in a web app in production?
[16:49] hackband has joined the channel
[16:50] bnoordhuis: BrianE: depends on the type of exception
[16:50] jredville has joined the channel
[16:50] BrianE: http://debuggable.com/posts/node-js-dealing-with-uncaught-exceptions:4c933d54-1428-443c-928d-4e1ecbdd56cb
[16:50] BrianE: ^ That is quite worrying :/
[16:51] bradleymeck: BrianE, hard question, depends. generally let it die and restart. By definition uncaughtException means state is out of whack or something unexpected occurs
[16:51] Rushing: looking for suggestions on syncing folders/files on mac...anyone?
[16:52] bnoordhuis: BrianE: so what kind of exceptions are you seeing?
[16:52] BrianE: I'm not
[16:52] BrianE: Just something I'm thinking about before writing web apps in Node, heh
[16:52] BrianE: Trying to pre-empt it, I've heard it's an issue
[16:53] bnoordhuis: not if you catch exceptions at the proper level
[16:53] BrianE: Well, what is the proper level?
[16:53] BrianE: I'm talking about programmer mistakes, here
[16:53] BrianE: Not expecting null to be passed to a function somewhere, whatever
[16:53] bnoordhuis: programmer mistakes = don't make them
[16:53] BrianE: Stuff like that *will* happen
[16:53] m00g00: I'd disagree compleatly with that...don't restart your node app less you have a good reason to do it
[16:53] BrianE: It simply will, and it's all good to strive not to make mistakes
[16:54] m00g00: not every time you catch an uncaught exception
[16:54] BrianE: So when it does, how do we recover in production?
[16:54] bnoordhuis: again, it depends
[16:54] BrianE: Dying without a cleanup isn't acceptable as we may be in the middle of some DB transaction or whatever
[16:54] m00g00: that's the DB's job to maintain its own consistency
[16:54] bnoordhuis: if all your logic is tied to the http request, just abort the request
[16:54] BrianE: And a cleanup doesn't seem possible without state etc
[16:54] m00g00: you could have a power outage too
[16:54] stride: that's like complaining that C stuff can segfault..

[21:01] tbranyen: bitbit: eventually =)
[21:01] tbranyen: bitbit: you know what you should look at it, is tim caswells wrapper for the git binary
[21:01] tbranyen: https://github.com/creationix/node-git
[21:02] cmr: Rushing: my favorite svn gui is git-svn
[21:02] cmr: s/gui/interface/
[21:03] bitbit: tbranyen: that was the first implementation I found, but I'm a bit confused as to what require('git') does. Kind of new to node.js (:
[21:03] eastc: where's the best place to instanciate a database connection? typically i just open a connection and use that throughout my applications, but i wasnt sure if thats recommended or not with something like nodejs.
[21:04] tbranyen: it requires the module after you've installedit
[21:04] bitbit: tbranyen: I mean, I know what require() is for, but it's not pointing to a specific file
[21:04] tbranyen: right its a module installed to node_modules

[21:17] bnoordhuis: that's what i mean :)
[21:17] Aria: CrawfordComeaux: So you're dealing with a system that doesn't maintain state -- there's no such thing as a 'persistent login'
[21:17] Aria: CrawfordComeaux: So what many (most) web systems do is trade the username and password for a time-limited token, a session ID.
[21:18] Aria: You'll have to pass that to everywhere it needs to be. Another option is a signed cookie. 
[21:18] Aria: CrawfordComeaux: So you put a timestamp and whatever other authorization into a cookie and sign it (or attach a hash), and then you can validate it anywhere you have the key.
[21:18] Aria: That variety distributes nicely, no shared state needed except what the client provides.

[21:19] bradleymeck: then again anything more than most ttl based solutions revolve around paranoia
[21:19] wingie: what is the best way for node.js to talk to a java (clojure) app?
[21:19] Aria: bitbit: Where did you install it to? You want to install it into the project that uses it, not your home directory.

[21:20] bitbit: Aria: How do I uninstall it from where I did? just delete the folder?
[21:20] wingie: bradleymeck: yeah perhaps that's the best way
[21:20] Aria: Yep.
[21:21] bradleymeck: wingie http://nodeup.com/nine has some insights as to why you should use http unless you are in a resource crunch
[21:21] Aria: (in fact, remove the entire node_modules -- you don't want that in a parent folder to your apps)

[21:22] CrawfordComeaux: Aria*
[21:22] wingie: bradleymeck: cool i'll check that out
[21:22] cmr: CrawfordComeaux: For websockets, you don't need to pass cookies like that.

[21:23] bradleymeck: HardP if something is GC'ed yes
[21:23] Aria: CrawfordComeaux: To initialize the socket, yes -- but websockets build on HTTP, so they can inherit cookies.

[21:23] cmr: Right
[21:23] bradleymeck: HardP, garbage collected

[21:34] TheFuzzball: Ah
[21:34] TheFuzzball: I might try that. I'm getting tired of the mixins :D

[21:35] HardP: then i can refer to config everywhere in my app
[21:35] bitbit: Aria: I did that. And then I run "node myproject/myprojectfile.js" that has "var Git = require('git')". Is the the correct folder structure?
[21:36] TheFuzzball: HardP I've never see global before..

[21:38] bitbit: Aria: Heh. simple... I'm starting to get it (: Thanks that worked
[21:39] Aria: Sure thing!
[21:39] Aria: Welcome to the new world order. Now make your own package.json in myproject/ -- and put a "dependencies": { "git-fs": "*" } key in there
[21:39] HardP: TheFuzzball: don't pollute the globals though

[22:48] megalomix: do i need to import a module to use json.stringify() ??
[22:48] saschagehlich: JSON.stringify
[22:48] saschagehlich: not json.stringify
[22:48] saschagehlich: :)
[22:48] megalomix: :)
[22:48] saschagehlich: sry
[22:49] megalomix: saschagehlich, when i store JSON.stringify
[22:49] megalomix: do i have to "convert" it again when i want the object ?
[22:49] saschagehlich: yup
[22:49] josh-k has joined the channel
[22:49] saschagehlich: using JSON.parse(redis_response);
[22:49] bosphorus has joined the channel
[22:49] megalomix: because in this manner i always get "string"
[22:49] megalomix: perfect
[22:49] megalomix: i try
[22:49] saschagehlich: where redis_response would be "obj"
[22:49] megalomix: ok
[22:50] megalomix: saschagehlich, yeaaaah now it works!!!
[22:50] megalomix:  :D
[22:50] saschagehlich: :)
[22:50] megalomix: very good, thank you
[22:50] saschagehlich: you're welcome

[22:53] saschagehlich: i dont think so
[22:53] tab1293: when i say download i mean one where the browser will save the file being pushed locally to the clients computer
[22:54] tab1293: saschagehlich, do you know of anyway of doing this with a push?
[22:54] TheJH: tab1293, maybe if you change the location of an iframe to a data-URL
[22:54] CarterL has joined the channel
[22:54] saschagehlich: what TheJH said would be possible, yeah
[22:55] tab1293: TheJH, could you explain that?

[22:55] saschagehlich: yup
[22:55] TheJH: tab1293, myIframesWindow.document.location = dataurl

[22:56] megalomix: i tried but it does work
[22:56] megalomix: maybe the / at the start

[23:01] HardP: can I emit an object instead of string?
[23:01] HardP: or an array?
[23:01] tab1293: TheJH, giving you a little more background idk if this method would work for what i am trying to do. my webserver is downloading a file from another server. i would like a client to be able to download this file as my webserver is getting it. i was thinking that maybe if node.js streams the file as it comes in the browser could pick up on this stream. but could you send pieces of the file in a data uri?
[23:01] TheJH: tab1293, if it's a huge file, data URI is a bad idea
[23:02] HardP: like emitter.emit({a:'b', c:'d'}, 'something')
[23:02] tab1293: TheJH yes they will mostly be large files
[23:02] TheJH: tab1293, if it's a huge file, let the browser connect to your server like in a normal download, then your server fetches the file and streams it back
[23:02] megalomix: see you soon guys! goodbye
[23:03] tab1293: ok, how would i set up this type of stream?
[23:03] EuroNerd has joined the channel
[23:03] tab1293: TheJH i dont know if you ever worked with tornado before but does this look like what i would use? http://www.tornadoweb.org/documentation/iostream.html
[23:04] tab1293: the example uses a client, but you can use that class with its webserver as well
[23:04] ekryski has joined the channel

[23:23] EuroNerd: [When I tried to apt-get install openssl, it said that I already have the latest version.]
[23:23] brainproxy: EuroNerd: maybe try nvm, you might like it :)
[23:23] EuroNerd: what's that?
[23:23] mde: EuroNerd: You need the dev library. 
[23:23] brainproxy: EuroNerd: try sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
[23:23] mde: Yes. :)
[23:23] brainproxy: EuroNerd: https://github.com/creationix/nvm
[23:24] joshontheweb has joined the channel
[23:24] brainproxy: nvm downloads, compiles and manages the installation of node and npm for you
[23:24] brainproxy: then you can switch versions easily
[23:24] brainproxy: e.g. `nvm use v0.6.6` or `nvm use v0.4.12`
[23:24] EuroNerd: hmmm... then I should have started with that.  :)  Instead, I've already launched the compiler and god only knows how it will end.
[23:25] brainproxy: it will probably be fine; nvm is just a convenience
[23:25] mde: Just kill the compile with Ctrl+c.
[23:25] EuroNerd: Not only am I new to node.js, I'm very much a Linux newbie too. :]
[23:25] brainproxy: ah
[23:25] Sorella has joined the channel
[23:25] mde: Then install the libssl-dev package.
[23:26] mde: The do the ./configure, etc. dance.
[23:26] brainproxy: EuroNerd: linode has a helpful library for working with linux servers
[23:26] brainproxy: document library, i mean
[23:26] EuroNerd: can't I just run compile again later?  I'm afraid an abrupt termination will break something
[23:26] brainproxy: nah, won't break anything
[23:26] sh1mmer: mde: I thought we shipped ssl with now
[23:27] mde: sh1mmer: He's compiling, so I imagine it still needs the headers in the dev lib. 
[23:27] sh1mmer: ah, yes

[23:28] mde: Ah, okay.
[23:29] mde: Nice. :)
[23:29] EuroNerd: thanks!  I've heard good words about Linode docs before, but I didn't go there yet, since I don't really know where to start. There's so much stuff on the web. ;)
[23:29] sh1mmer: Dion, Ben and Eran convinced me
[23:29] sh1mmer: but they are doing really good stuff here
[23:29] mde: They're solid dudes, yes. 
[23:29] sh1mmer: So I'm happy to get the chance to work with thjem
[23:29] mde: And of course WM has huge tech, so the range of problems must be really fucking interesting.
[23:30] EuroNerd: I assume the fact that I'm running my own Ubuntu in VirtualBox on my laptop doesn't make much difference when using Linode docs?
[23:30] brainproxy: EuroNerd: shouldn't make too much of a difference
[23:30] sh1mmer: mde: sure there is a ton of stuff going on, but I'm glad to be 100% Node focused. 
[23:30] mde: EuroNerd: The Ubuntu docs are pretty good too. They do a good job of making things clear for new people.
[23:30] brainproxy: I have a very basic writeup for setting up a linux vm for use w/ node
[23:30] brainproxy: https://github.com/michaelsbradleyjr/vps-setup
[23:31] brainproxy: haven't updated it in awhile, but should still be fine
[23:31] EuroNerd: thanks
[23:31] mde: sh1mmer: Hell, yes. I'm still splitting my time between browser and server. Gets a little frustrating sometimes.
[23:31] bradw2k: hello, I'm trying to build node on Windows, but vcbuild.bat complains "File tools\gyp_node, line 20, print 'Error running GYP' ... SyntaxError: invalid syntax", any ideas?
[23:31] mde: And Yammer isn't quite at that scale ... yet. :)

[23:32] mde: Pretty exciting to see.
[23:32] EuroNerd: brainproxy, I don't even know which one I'm getting, I was just following this tut: http://nodenode.com/post/1197688151/installing-node-js-on-ubuntu-screencast-tutorial

[23:37] EuroNerd: very weird, apt-get install libssl-dev also yielded response that I already have the newest ver, and yet ./configure claims that openssl is not found.
[23:37] EuroNerd: maybe I really should get nvm and it would solve that problem for me ;)
[23:37] mde: It might, but I reckon it will still have to compile Node.
[23:38] bnoordhuis: EuroNerd: make sure you have pkg-config installed
[23:38] mde: bnoordhuis: Is that not part of build-essential?
[23:39] EuroNerd: bnoordhuis, you're right!  now with pkg-config it suddenly sees openssl  :)
[23:39] bnoordhuis: mde: don't think so, build-essential is system headers, a compiler and make
[23:40] mde: Hm, I've never had to install anything other than build-essential and libssl-dev to compile Node.
[23:41] EuroNerd: bnoordhuis, mde, it's worth noting that I'm actually running two VMs, one with Ubuntu Desktop and one with Ubuntu Server. And Desktop didn't have this problem with openssl, while Server did.
[23:42] r04r has joined the channel
[23:42] EuroNerd: this is my insurance policy, you see, since something will probably go wrong at some point and I'll have a fallback with a slightly different config  :]
[23:43] EuroNerd: (both Ubuntus are latest LTS)
[23:43] mde: EuroNerd: so probably something with the minimal server install. Maybe a missing package, yes.
[23:43] mde: Oh, I missed your post up there.
[23:43] mde: Weird that it would be missing something so basic.
[23:44] EuroNerd: Is there still a point for me to get nvm, now that I'm almost done with compilation?
[23:45] EuroNerd: perhaps for managing npm? 
[23:46] mde: EuroNerd: Unless you're needing to run the old stable version and the new stable version side-by-side, it might not be worth the effort.
