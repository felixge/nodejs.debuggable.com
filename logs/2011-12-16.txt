[00:04] Vespakoen: Say I want to be able to do the things you see below, getting a new instance of NI via NI.app() and, load a model for that instance
[00:04] Vespakoen: var NI = require('./NI/core');
[00:04] Vespakoen: var App = NI.app() // new NI object
[00:04] Vespakoen: App.load.model('modelname'); // Load a model

[00:16] Vespakoen: actually, NI.load.prototype.model = function() {}; is probably super-stupid, i guess i need something like function model() { loadModel code in here }  NI.prototype.load = function() { return {'model': model}; }  ?

[00:19] seejohnrun: Vespakoen: yes, you'll want a method that returns a Model with whatever you'd like set up

[00:20] cody-- has joined the channel
[00:20] Vespakoen: i see, but i dont want , when calling App.load , that i loads the Model function already, i guess with my aprroach it will, do i need an anonymous function to do this?
[00:21] juli has joined the channel
[00:22] salva has joined the channel
[00:22] seejohnrun: Vespakoen: I'd think of it like loadModel, just getting rid of the second prototype, or implement a Loader that gets returned from load - otherwise you won't be accessing the prototype
[00:22] Vespakoen: ahh, i must sound vague, im really sorry for that, what i am trying to say, the .load object will have a lot of prototype functions, i am affraid that if i dont do the "return {model: ?, somethingelse: ?} " part at the ? right, it will load everything before i actually need it
[00:23] mansoor has joined the channel
[00:23] Vespakoen: "implementing a loader" would be NI.prototype.load = function(whatdoyouwant) { whatdoyouwant loader code } ?
[00:24] seejohnrun: Vespakoen: more like load = function() { return new Loader(this); };
[00:24] eknuth has left the channel
[00:24] Vespakoen: ahh i see
[00:24] seejohnrun: Vespakoen: so just like you were doing, but making it work, since before it wouldn't with the double prototype like you had it
[00:24] Vespakoen: i see, i think that will fix my problem! thanks a lot mate!
[00:24] seejohnrun: Vespakoen: and probably only want to make a new one once, so may as well have it be a property on App when it loads

[02:39] jxson has joined the channel
[02:39] wslh: do you have a quick example? I think it's not more than five lines.
[02:39] wslh: but the documentation is horrible.
[02:40] moogoo: eh...not sure what you mean
[02:40] moogoo: read-eval-print-loop
[02:41] wslh: I want to do: require('repl').start('> ', process.stdin, eval)
[02:41] wslh: and it doesn't work
[02:41] mikzz has joined the channel
[02:41] marcello3d has joined the channel

[02:41] wslh: first, the documentation give the example about process.stdin, but if you pass process.stdin an exception occurs
[02:41] a_suenami has joined the channel
[02:41] wslh: so I finally pass undefined, and that works
[02:42] wslh: but the issue is that you need to pass an eval function with this signature:
[02:42] wslh: function eval(cmd, callback) {   callback(null, result); }
[02:42] wslh: I can't understand what it means.
[02:43] moogoo: hm...is this something new to .6?

[02:57] jesusabdullah: This is the eval function in the repl?

[02:58] jesusabdullah: I don't think it has a sync version
[02:59] wslh: Lingerance, it doesn't work that way.
[02:59] wslh: jesusabdullah: yes.
[03:00] jesusabdullah: wslh: So what's the problem?
[03:00] munichlinux: is there any app that manages sessions with couchdb? I mean relate session with user, encode, decode
[03:00] maxogden: munichlinux: wat
[03:00] wslh: the problem is: I just want to start a repl with my own eval
[03:00] jesusabdullah: Okay
[03:00] jesusabdullah: so do that
[03:00] maxogden: munichlinux: couch has its own cookie based auth api that handles sessions
[03:00] munichlinux: maxogden, what?
[03:00] maxogden: munichlinux: i dont understand your question
[03:01] jesusabdullah: Keep in mind, the "read" part has a bunch of js validation stuff in it, so you can't like, throw a brainfuck interpreter in there and expect it to work
[03:01] wslh: I can tell you what I want to achieve.
[03:02] jesusabdullah: Yeah, do that
[03:03] wslh: at this stage, just use the repl with the same eval function of the original repl.
[03:03] wslh: then, I want to use fibers around that eval
[03:03] wslh: but, this is another topic
[03:04] Aria has joined the channel
[03:04] wslh: so, if you have a simple example of using my own eval function that will be great

[03:04] crescendo has joined the channel
[03:04] munichlinux: maxogden, no i wanted nodejs to store sessions in couchdb and when request comes I want relate user from the session. 
[03:04] jesusabdullah: That's the function it uses.
[03:05] wslh: so, it's different from what it say in the documentation?
[03:05] jesusabdullah: https://github.com/jesusabdullah/node-ripple/blob/master/bin/ripple is an example of everything else you can do with it, basically
[03:05] theycallmeswift has joined the channel
[03:05] jesusabdullah: wslh: No, it has the same signature
[03:06] maxogden: munichlinux: ah i see. i dont know an out of the box module for that
[03:06] wslh: ok, I am starting to understand... thanks, I'll try to just copy that first
[03:07] jesusabdullah: munichlinux: It's not particularly tough to treat users like any other resource
[03:07] brianseeders has joined the channel
[03:08] jesusabdullah: I mean, you don't need special stuff for that really
[03:08] munichlinux: jesusabdullah, right. I need to write all that code. I was looking for a session manager. Its not a couple of functions 
[03:08] jesusabdullah: ah
[03:08] munichlinux: jesusabdullah, you would 
[03:08] jesusabdullah: yeah, a full session manager
[03:09] munichlinux: its not just storing session id and {"user": "foo", password: "bar"}
[03:09] jesusabdullah: Oh! Check out https://github.com/substack/node-sesame
[03:09] jesusabdullah: idk if that's quite what you're looking for, but it *says* it does session-y things
[03:10] munichlinux: i am saying its not just that 
[03:10] munichlinux: session manager does lot more stuff
[03:10] munichlinux: ACTION from django :p
[03:10] StanlySoManly1 has joined the channel
[03:11] jesusabdullah: Here, show me an example of what you're looking for
[03:12] BiCarb_ has joined the channel
[03:12] wedtm has joined the channel
[03:12] malkomalko has joined the channel
[03:13] munichlinux: ok, these are functionalities what i would expect a session manager to do. when i authenticate a user, create sessions store and related user. Encode user/ decode user data with secret. Have middleware which checks sessions on every request and have user object available on the request object.
[03:14] mikeal has joined the channel
[03:14] Aria: Question about that though: Would you expect to do anything while waiting on the session storage to respond?
[03:14] jesusabdullah: It looks like sesame does all that
[03:15] jesusabdullah: except maybe without a couch backend
[03:15] jesusabdullah: but you could build one pretty easy

[03:18] juske_ has joined the channel
[03:18] jesusabdullah: You can probably find modules that let you talk to couch easy, and modules that handle cookies for you, but they're probably gonna be separated and you might have to write some wiring
[03:19] munichlinux: ya 
[03:19] nerdfiles1 has joined the channel
[03:19] nerdfiles1 has left the channel
[03:19] wilmoore has joined the channel
[03:20] jesusabdullah: Maybe look for a cookies middleware and wire it to something like flatiron/resourceful, or some other backend engine
[03:20] ryanallenbobcat has joined the channel
[03:20] jesusabdullah: but yeah, I can't think of an all-in-one deal
[03:21] Aria: munichlinux: Ah. I'd be doing all sorts of preemptive fetching in that time.
[03:21] Aria: (Assume it'll work, bail before sending if it fails.)
[03:22] munichlinux: Aria, what do you mean preemptive fetches? 
[03:22] tingham_ has joined the channel
[03:22] jesusabdullah: Start doing api calls and prepare the return payload before auth is complete
[03:22] jesusabdullah: and then wait for a "yea" or "nay" on sending it
[03:23] jesusabdullah: (if necessary)
[03:23] jesusabdullah: which sounds like a cool idea
[03:24] joshsmith: heh fun waste of the past hour: http://forrst.com/posts/Happy_and_sad_command_line_customization-J0w
[03:24] Aria: This is why one size fits all APIs often don't fit all. (And why I prefer good building blocks to transparent middleware)
[03:25] jesusabdullah: I think middlewares are a useful abstraction, but a middleware also shouldn't try to do too much, at least not without config and defaults
[03:25] Aria: Indeed.
[03:25] Aria: I like it when it is one of those building blocks.
[03:26] jocafa has joined the channel
[03:28] jlank: for an express app, is there a project convention as far as where to write middleware?
[03:28] m00p has joined the channel
[03:28] jesusabdullah: jlank: What do you mean?
[03:28] yuwang has joined the channel
[03:29] jesusabdullah: You usually write middlewares as separate modules, then require them
[03:29] jesusabdullah: something like,
[03:29] munichlinux: jlank, ahhh welcome to the jungle 
[03:29] jesusabdullah: var middleware = require("middleware");
[03:29] hydrogenesis has joined the channel
[03:29] jesusabdullah: or,
[03:29] jlank: ok, because I was watching the screen casts and tjholowaychuk was doing most stuff in the app.js or routes/index.js
[03:30] jesusabdullah: var middleware = require("middleware")(opts); // <-- that too
[03:30] jlank: i know it was just an example, but I wrote some stuff and made modules and required them
[03:30] munichlinux: simple i am cribbing about for quite some time. There is conventions not proper way to layouting code base. I follow mine.
[03:30] jesusabdullah: jlank: oh, yeah, tj has this whole directory structure for express. I suppose he may have a convention for where to put internal libraries
[03:30] jesusabdullah: but really, there's no canonical convention for this sort of thing
[03:31] jlank: because there is node_modules when you just express newproj the boilerplate
[03:31] jlank: i'm new at frameworks in general so I want to try to keep things as tidy as possible
[03:31] jesusabdullah: Yeah, that's where npm installed things go

[03:32] munichlinux: jlank, i was about to put a MVC boilerplate on the express js. I will send to the mailing list once i have it on the git hub.
[03:32] aar0ntw has joined the channel
[03:32] jlank: munichlinux: awesome thanks for the heads up
[03:32] jesusabdullah: What I usually do is have my main entry point in ./lib/thing.js
[03:32] jesusabdullah: and then arrange things into some folders that make sense from there
[03:32] jesusabdullah: A lot of Nodejitsu projects put the rest of the stuff in ./lib/thing/
[03:33] mikeal has joined the channel
[03:33] jesusabdullah: but yeah, not really a convention outside of our projects but we're somewhat consistent about it (and trying to be more so)
[03:33] jlank: sounds like a reasonable place to put things
[03:33] torm3nt has joined the channel
[03:33] jesusabdullah: Yeah, just come up with a convention and roll with it I say
[03:34] jlank: ya, I really just want to be consistent, and in the off chance someone else looks at a project I would like for them to at least look in the 'right' place 
[03:34] jesusabdullah: Yeah
[03:34] jlank: i could also just note it in the readme
[03:34] jesusabdullah: Yeah, or keep the project small enough that people can sort it out without too much help
[03:34] jesusabdullah: either way
[03:35] jlank: sound advice, much appreciated

[05:18] wang: if its an academic thing... i guess the basic idea is, receive the video from the publisher in a format your viewers will understand.. if flash can output it like that, maybe all you have to do is relay it
[05:19] kishoreyekkanti has joined the channel
[05:20] qard: From what I understand, Flash has to communicate through Flash Media Server because of some proprietary encoding stuff or something. Then I guess node would collect it from there and stream it back out over rtmp or something. Lots of stuff I'd need to research though.

[05:22] boltR has joined the channel
[05:23] qard: Not sure if there are any special limitations in mobile.
[05:23] qard: My thought was streaming mp4, so non html5 browsers can fallback to flash.

[07:01] jesusabdullah: long-polling is a technique where send a request and then and keep the connection open waiting for a response
[07:01] jesusabdullah: where you send a request, I mean
[07:02] jesusabdullah: websockets are this new thing that lets you open a new streaming connection for real-time stuffs
[07:02] jesusabdullah: socket.io is an abstraction over websockets and four other transports that let you do this sort of thing
[07:02] jesusabdullah: and dnode is an rpc layer on top of that
[07:03] jesusabdullah: I'd say use socket.io or something similar to get all fallbacks and stuff. Doing that real-time kinda thing by-hand is a pain
[07:03] jesusabdullah: and dnode runs on top of socket.io so...
[07:03] blueadept has joined the channel
[07:03] willwhite has joined the channel
[07:03] jesusabdullah: fwiw, nowjs also runs on top of socket.io
[07:03] jesusabdullah: I personally like the dnode api best, but ymmv
[07:05] Sample: gotcha, thanks
[07:05] shiawuen has joined the channel
[07:05] Sample: im kind of the "reinvent the wheel" type person when it comes to new stuff
[07:05] Sample: ive been very purposefully avoiding express for now and working directly with node
[07:05] Sample: in the same fashion i avoided jquery until i really had a super solid grasp on javascript
[07:06] Sample: but trying to wedge open my http request and do the long-polling thing would probably just end up in a clunky end-result anyways
[07:06] ph^ has joined the channel
[07:07] jesusabdullah: Yeah
[07:07] jesusabdullah: If that's the case
[07:07] jesusabdullah: I'd say go with socket.io

[07:08] mansoor: but then I took an arrow on the wrist :(
[07:09] jesusabdullah: I try not to have to write that rate of code XD
[07:09] jetienne_: to code at more than 1 word per min and you are the smartest i ever seen
[07:09] Sample: jetienne: it wouldnt be that im trying to write socket.io from the ground up, but rather know the history of where socket.io came from (with long polling, which was what everyone did successfully prior to this newfangled websockets). and i think having that kind of knowledge is beneficial

[17:05] jergason: ah
[17:05] jergason: didn't know about request.abort
[17:05] mmalecki: not sure about the api for aborting requests
[17:06] devaholic: cb.call in that case would assue that `this` is undefined in cb
[17:06] jergason: ok, will look in to it
[17:06] devaholic: assure rather
[17:06] mmalecki: yeah, not sure if it works like that, but I'm sure there's something like that
[17:06] jergason: mmalecki: you are a smart man.
[17:06] jergason: request.abort() it is
[17:07] mmalecki: haha

[18:05] lietu: I only add the $ if it's wrapped in something that you normally don't expect, e.g. $element if it's a jquery element etc.
[18:05] xerox: also you can .bind(this) the callbacks
[18:05] lietu: also, endsub, you could probably just pass this.setData.bind(this)

[18:15] megalomix: because i can use ONE time res.render
[18:15] megalomix: but if the res.redirect will be executed i don't know how to write it
[18:15] megalomix: model. <---- are async functions
[18:15] lietu: I'm not quite following
[18:16] megalomix: lietu, i mean that i can put res.render at the end of init() 
[18:16] pandora17 has joined the channel
[18:16] megalomix: i add err in the object and then i render all
[18:16] megalomix: the problem is the redirect....because if i put the res.render at the end

[18:16] megalomix: i will have
[18:16] megalomix: res.redirect() and then res.render()

[18:19] megalomix: *i can't
[18:19] ShinyDarkness has joined the channel
[18:20] lietu: var showPage = true; ... else { res.redirect(...); showPage = false } ... put the if( showPage ) { res.render(...); } in a function that you call at the end of the model.frmContact() - callback, and at the else {} at the end ?
[18:20] lietu: or something
[18:20] megalomix: lietu, i can't do it
[18:20] megalomix: because it is async
[18:20] megalomix: maybe if(showPage) {}
[18:21] megalomix: should be executed before the res.redirect
[18:21] JakubRacek has joined the channel
[18:21] lietu: as I said, put it at the end of the callback, inside it, so it's called after the async operation is done, AND at the else it goes to if the async call is not done

[18:21] lzskiss: lietu, +1

It presents an error regarding invalid json, and fails.  I can replicate my other test dbs around though, so I'm pretty sure I'm couchdb operational.  Any thoughts?
