[01:04] ryah_: nat + ipv4

[01:09] postwait: for TCP and UDP there isn't much internals more.
[01:09] postwait: It's all the f'in apps that expect and IP and only resolve to A instead of both A and AAAA records.
[01:09] ryah_: i'm sure the URL library breaks on ipv6 addresses, for example
[01:09] postwait: but... that's not so much a core node problem at all.

[01:09] postwait: Have you thought about pulling in the urlparser from code.google.com?

[03:08] xthsky has joined the channel
[03:08] pyrotechnick: from ascii to unicode i imagine

[03:09] pyrotechnick: yeah
[03:09] piscisaureus: but iso 8859_1 isnt
[03:09] pyrotechnick: i just want to not use that method

[03:12] piscisaureus: i don't know where dthe data comes from
[03:12] pyrotechnick: it comes from geoip, theyre csv and or dat files
[03:13] pyrotechnick: encoded with 8859-1 which is just ascii + some latin characters
[03:13] pyrotechnick: do you think i could use https://github.com/bnoordhuis/node-iconv
[03:13] piscisaureus: but if you have like "vlädivóstoçk" encoded in 8859, then String::New will fail or result in invalid characters
[03:13] pyrotechnick: instead of that method?
[03:15] piscisaureus: well these are iconv buildings so you can use them in javascript
[03:15] piscisaureus: in C-land you would just use iconv proper
[03:15] pyrotechnick: libiconv?

[04:31] piscisaureus: isaacs: are you here anyway? :=)
[04:31] isaacs: hey, kinda
[04:31] isaacs: what's up?
[04:31] isaacs: piscisaureus: npm help folders
[04:32] piscisaureus: isaacs: I'm trying to figure out what it takes to make it run on windows :-)
[04:32] isaacs: piscisaureus: yeah, i've been kinda thinking about that, as well
[04:32] piscisaureus: isaacs: apparently you use symlinks that are not supported on windows yet
[04:32] isaacs: yeah
[04:33] isaacs: it is a major undertaking to move away from symlinks.
[04:33] hij1nx: pkrumins: Rene's licence calls to include the whole header comment, not just the url. not that i really care, but his website did help me understand the source code a little better.
[04:33] piscisaureus: isaacs: hmmm. it is not necessarily needed to move away from them
[04:33] ryah_: piscisaureus: your line endings became screwed in your last commits
[04:33] visionik has joined the channel
[04:34] isaacs: piscisaureus: oh?
[04:34] piscisaureus: isaacs: well, we will only support XP and up
[04:34] c4milo1 has joined the channel
[04:34] ryah_: piscisaureus: can you set your git to change those automatically?
[04:34] isaacs: piscisaureus: xp has symlinks!?
[04:34] piscisaureus: ryah_: ok. will look into that
[04:34] isaacs: piscisaureus: i thought symlinks weren't until win7
[04:34] piscisaureus: isaacs: yeah. directory symlinks only. but they are kinda dangerous 
[04:34] tmzt: there's some good test cases for wine and reactos that might help quantify what windows versions support symlinks and to what degree
[04:35] piscisaureus: isaacs: but the thing is
[04:35] piscisaureus: explorer doesn't get it
[04:35] isaacs: i see
[04:35] piscisaureus: if you delete a symlinked folder from explorer, it will delete the contents of the target folder
[04:35] isaacs: already there are some issues with some IDE plugins and stuff that try to map out folders without grokking lstat
[04:36] piscisaureus: isaacs: stat is another problem, but that can be worked around. stat(/foo/bar/symlink) does lstat, actually
[04:36] hosh_work has joined the channel
[04:36] isaacs: piscisaureus: i'd be curious to know what actually fails.
[04:37] isaacs: m.
[04:37] ryah_: piscisaureus: git config --global core.autocrlf true
[04:37] ryah_: piscisaureus: i think that's what you need...
[04:37] isaacs: piscisaureus: i'd be curious to know what actually fails.  i only actually use symlinks to dirs, except if youhave a bin that isnt' a node program.
[04:37] konobi: piscisaureus: the symlinks are NTFS only thing, right?
[04:38] piscisaureus: isaacs: there's no support in node for symlinks currently but it will fail anyway
[04:38] piscisaureus: isaacs: yep
[04:38] isaacs: piscisaureus: you mean there's no fs.symlink or fs.readlink in node-on-windows?
[04:38] piscisaureus: no
[04:38] piscisaureus: not currently
[04:38] piscisaureus: because libc has no support for it, so I have to call the windows api itself
[04:38] konobi: they're different from NTFS junction points too?
[04:39] piscisaureus: a junction point is like a directory symlink, supported from win2k and up
[04:39] isaacs: i see
[04:39] piscisaureus: there are also 'real' symlinks from vista and up
[04:39] piscisaureus: but it makes a distinction between file and directory symlinks
[04:39] konobi: junction points were in win 2k as well, you just needed to download a client app to actually set them, iirc
[04:40] isaacs: so, we could have: win2k+, "junctions" at fs.symlink/readlink, which only work on dirs, and then proper symlinks in vista+?
[04:40] piscisaureus: isaacs: kinda
[04:40] piscisaureus: yeah
[04:40] isaacs: piscisaureus: oh, i also do symlinks for man and bin files to activate them.
[04:41] piscisaureus: that wouldn't work on xp
[04:41] piscisaureus: but hey, man files on windows?
[04:41] isaacs: so you might have: /usr/local/bin/foo@1.2.3, foo@2.3.4, foo->foo@1.2.23
[04:41] ezmobius has joined the channel
[04:41] isaacs: yeah, but bins are a bigger deal
[04:41] isaacs: anyway, i could part with that.  it's just a convenience
[04:41] piscisaureus: hmm ( ... thinking ... )
[04:42] ajpiano has joined the channel
[04:42] piscisaureus: isaacs: maybe for bins etc you could use hard links?
[04:42] piscisaureus: you would just need to make sure the target exists
[04:42] piscisaureus: before creating the link
[04:43] isaacs: yeah
[04:43] isaacs: i don't love hard links
[04:43] piscisaureus: me neither
[04:43] isaacs: in fact, i kind of hate them
[04:43] piscisaureus: it would only apply to xp tho, for anything later symlinks are the way to go anyway
[04:43] ShizWeaK_: ACTION waits for the pitchforks to come out
[04:43] isaacs: they're magical, and not obvious
[04:44] isaacs: ew ew ew ew, no, oh god no.
[04:44] isaacs: idon't want to do version-sniffing
[04:44] piscisaureus: what kind of bins are you talking about anyway
[04:44] isaacs: $(which npm)
[04:44] isaacs: ls -laF $(which npm)
[04:44] isaacs: you'll see what i'm talking about
[04:44] piscisaureus: ouch yeah
[04:44] piscisaureus: maybe create a .bat file that points to the bin?
[04:44] isaacs: i mean, i could use a different sort of shim, or a bat file, or whatever.
[04:45] isaacs: yeah
[04:45] isaacs: it could be done.
[04:45] piscisaureus: it sucks I know
[04:45] isaacs: i already wrap the fs module, though, i mean, patching one more function isn't SO bad.
[04:45] isaacs: i could just change fs.readlink and fs.symlink to do different things, write a batch file and read it, or somethign
[04:46] konobi: bad isaacs, bad!
[04:46] konobi: ACTION slaps wrist
[04:46] isaacs: konobi: I KNOW!!
[04:46] isaacs: but it's windows, what are you going to do?
[04:46] isaacs: it's the MSIE of operating systems
[04:46] konobi: shoot anyone who says they care about it... make the world a safer and saner place
[04:46] piscisaureus: If I completely agreed with that statement, I wouldn't be working on windows heh...
[04:46] isaacs: konobi: yeah, but then i'd have ot shoot ryah_ and piscisaureus and they're such nice chaps
[04:47] piscisaureus: but some stuff is broken I agree
[04:47] isaacs: konobi: your heart is in the right place, though.
[04:47] konobi: isaacs: sometimes someone has to take something for the team
[04:47] konobi: =0P
[04:48] piscisaureus: ryah: setting done. sorry about that :-(
[04:48] isaacs: konobi: it actually should'nt require *that* much patching to make npm work on windows, if node builds there.
[04:48] isaacs: but this symlink thing, it's a real pita
[04:48] isaacs: i really <3 symlinks.
[04:48] konobi: isaacs: I'd rather have the functions work in node core and hide the abstraction
[04:48] piscisaureus: isaacs: I think there will be 3 issues:
[04:48] aaronblohowiak: isaacs++ ++ ++
[04:48] aaronblohowiak: (for the MSIE of operating systems comment)
[04:48] isaacs: aaronblohowiak: thanks :)
[04:48] piscisaureus: - where does node look for stuff? like in %HOME%/somewhere ?
[04:49] piscisaureus: - symlink
[04:49] piscisaureus: - a nice way to install npm on windows
[04:49] isaacs: piscisaureus: 1. that's a bigger topic.  the module system path may go away completely in favor of something that's more deterministic and less flaky.
[04:49] isaacs: 2. that's sad.  but i think we can make it work.
[04:49] tmzt: cygwin symlinks don't work?
[04:50] tmzt: (the emulated ones)
[04:50] piscisaureus: I don't want them
[04:50] isaacs: 3. i can write a batch file to mimic the install.sh
[04:50] bingomanatee_: Substack is showing off his browser emulator
[04:50] isaacs: tmzt: npm already runs on cygwin
[04:50] richcollins has joined the channel
[04:50] isaacs: but cygwin is a pain
[04:50] piscisaureus: cygwin is a pain and it is really slow 
[04:50] isaacs: windows users don't wanna use cygwin.  they want a native program.
[04:51] isaacs: they want unix, really, they just don't know it.

[04:51] shaver: msys is a little better than cygwin
[04:51] piscisaureus: well, everyday there are several ppl here asking 'hey I tried cygwin but this and that went wrong'
[04:51] shaver: but very very little
[04:51] piscisaureus: I don't want msys either
[04:51] piscisaureus: just using it as a build environment
[04:52] piscisaureus: and I want to switch to msvc badly bit it's hard to get node to compile there
[04:52] tmzt: sure
[04:52] shaver: oh
[04:52] shaver: we use msys to drive the build system, which calls msvc
[04:52] isaacs: msvc is a nice idea
[04:52] isaacs: *ide
[04:52] isaacs: i do kinda miss visual studio
[04:52] shaver: the windows debugging tools are pretty amazing
[04:53] tmzt: what's wrong with mingw and native win32 (without msys)?
[04:53] isaacs: other than that, though, windows can go out behind the shed and die.
[04:53] piscisaureus: tmzt: gcc on windows is a bad compiler. msvc produces better programs
[04:54] piscisaureus: isaacs: yeah I don't think I really need to convice you but ... there are just too many ppl that want to use windows
[04:54] langworthy has joined the channel
[04:54] tmzt: I guess since node is c++ you would have api issues mixing the two
[04:54] piscisaureus: isaacs: and for node to become really big you must cater those people

[04:55] shaver: ACTION knows too
[04:55] isaacs: piscisaureus: expect various stages of grief.
[04:55] isaacs: denial, anger, bargaining, etc.
[04:55] piscisaureus: isaacs: hehe
[04:55] piscisaureus: i don't want to be the windows evangelist here :-(
[04:55] tmzt: piscisaureus: no, just followed the project
[04:55] tmzt: for years :)
[04:56] isaacs: piscisaureus: the great thing about using windows is you're uniquely qualified to hate it thoroughly

[04:57] tmzt: posix compatibility meant programs that didn't do anything worked
[04:57] tmzt: anything that wanted to do something (like graphics output) failed
[04:57] piscisaureus: isaacs: but I don't really hate windows programming in general
[04:57] piscisaureus: only the ways things are done are sooo different
[04:58] piscisaureus: but if node would drop posix support, libev and libeio could just go away
[04:58] piscisaureus: because windows provides the stuff that it does natively in a pretty consistent way
[04:58] tmzt: drop posix support?
[04:58] isaacs: piscisaureus: if node dropped posix support, it'd lose everything that makes it awesome
[04:58] tmzt: you mean just have native support for linux and windows?
[04:59] isaacs: ok, gotta run
[04:59] piscisaureus: tmzt: obviously we don't do that

[05:00] shaver: piscisaureus: rarely
[05:00] piscisaureus: isaacs: do that. warn me if ryah_ starts to look psycho. I'm afraid I pissed off ryah_ a little with the tty stuff
[05:01] piscisaureus: shaver: well, you're just a manager right :-)
[05:01] piscisaureus: you're doing pretty well for a manager 
[05:01] shaver: I've actually written code every day for the past week

[05:02] piscisaureus: sounds fun
[05:02] shaver: travels over familiar terrain, etc.
[05:03] piscisaureus: shaver: well, time for a change then. wanna do some node coding? :p
[05:05] shaver: I'm writing some stuff in node, actually

[05:06] tmzt: okay, I'm thinking of all the review tags
[05:07] shaver: I mean, I harbour some lust for spidermonkey's generators and function expressions and destructuring in node
[05:07] tmzt: I need to read brendens blog post
[05:07] shaver: but if I really wanted I could probably find people to prototype nodemonkey (really a V8 API veneer over spidermonkey)
[05:07] konobi: generators are funky... I just haven't found a good use for them
[05:07] shaver: (because V8's API is way nicer)
[05:08] konobi: yes... spidermonkey API is shockily nasty
[05:08] shaver: it is...elderly
[05:08] konobi: =0)
[05:08] ryah_: shaver: doesn't v8 have a shim to jscore so that it fits into webkit?
[05:08] ryah_: shaver: why not target that api - then you'd get both 
[05:09] ryah_: (i'm just assuming - i haven't looked at the code)
[05:09] tmzt: ryah_: how much of node is new code and how much is v8?
[05:09] shaver: ryah_: there's a shim, yeah
[05:09] ryah_: tmzt: ?
[05:09] shaver: ryah_: not a bad idea
[05:09] ryah_: tmzt: all the non-js stuff is node :)
[05:09] tmzt: I mean how does it break down
[05:09] shaver: know anyone who wants to work on it? :-)
[05:10] mjr___: tmzt: check out the repo, the directories are organized very cleanly.
[05:10] konobi: shaver, you need to hire claes jakkobsen for that =0)
[05:10] mjr___: tmzt: JS goes in lib, and C++ goes in src.

[05:11] ryah_: tmzt: v8.h is the only documentation, but it's good
[05:12] piscisaureus: ryah_: oh really? I should check it out ...
[05:12] ryah_: piscisaureus: yeah, lots of helpful comments
[05:12] piscisaureus: because that embedders guide covers only the basic stuff
[05:12] piscisaureus: and it is still really a mystery to me what that magic ObjectWrap class exactly does
[05:12] konobi: there's the C++ way of doing things... then there's the V8 way... then there's the mix between the two
[05:13] piscisaureus: and cb_persist and that kind of stuff
[05:13] tmzt: shaver: have you guys got xpcom mostly out of firefox 4 or what's up with that?
[05:13] tmzt: haven't read pmo in months, too busy on other stuff
[05:14] shaver: we use it less, I'm sure it'll always be there in some form
[05:14] tmzt: this one might sound crazy, but could html ever replace xul in the ui?

[05:58] jimt_ has joined the channel
[05:58] micheil: orientDB does look interesting
[05:59] Stephen_: at first with the Javascript API which is over the rest api so its integration shouldnt be that hard... but the model should be designed in such a way that later when then OrientDB C API is complete that it can be compiled in as a node.js module connector and the model easily switched to it
[05:59] micheil: minds you though, I can't subscribe to using java for my database... 
[05:59] Stephen_: its pretty nice as it has high speed graph traversals, document store and SQL syntax
[05:59] aaronblohowiak: Stephen_: one of the issues with what you want is that there isn't a common MVC framework, Express comes closest but it just does the V and C
[06:00] Stephen_: Name another Graph database that isnt built on java and doesnt cost a fortune
[06:00] aaronblohowiak: Stephen_: so the "Model" for OrientDB would either be orient-specific or a whole new project
[06:00] Stephen_: Geddy is an MVC
[06:00] micheil: Stephen_: have you looked at neo4j or blueprint?
[06:00] micheil: (admittedly neo4j is java as well)
[06:00] Stephen_: it has models and connectors that I speak of for other db's
[06:01] Stephen_: neo4j isnt as nice as OrientDB for a number of reasons
[06:01] aaronblohowiak: Oh wow, how have I not heard of geddy before?
[06:02] ShizWeaK_: ditto
[06:02] konobi: Stephen_: there's always Kioku
[06:02] konobi: there's KiokuJS too... you'd just need to implement an OrientDB backend
[06:03] Stephen_: @aaronblohowiak when looking through the examples in Geddy's models, it seemed the model handled all the database's api commands
[06:03] andrewfff has joined the channel

[06:18] Stephen_: which is why we think it is up for the job more than node.js

[06:35] rudyl313: any wisdom out there?
[06:37] Aria: Your postgres is set to require ident authentication in pg_hba.conf
[06:37] Aria: Might want to set it to trust, or run the code as a user with privilege to create databases.

[06:39] rudyl313: Aria: ok... hmm I actually do remember someone saying to use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost
[06:39] rudyl313: I wanna try that real quick
[06:40] langworthy has joined the channel
[06:40] RushPL: http://wklej.org/id/460522/ - what does it mean?
[06:41] jdalton has joined the channel
[06:41] RushPL: why does it leak? can I block this message if it is harmless or is it a real memory leak?
[06:41] rudyl313: Aria: https://gist.github.com/787504
[06:41] Aria: How many listeners are you adding, RushPL?
[06:42] rudyl313: Aria: looks like 127.0.0.1 is supposed to use MD5
[06:42] RushPL: well .. I am creating a http server and then starting to listen at 8081. I am using the simplest of API methods.
[06:42] Aria: rudyl313: So if it uses unix domain socket to connect, it'll use ident auth. If not, it'll use the password hashed with md5. So whatever you're doing isn't using the hostname, and is going unix instead.
[06:42] RushPL: if by adding listeners you mean creating some custom listeners objects, I am not doing it. ;)
[06:43] rudyl313: hmmm
[06:43] Aria: (with postgresql, "localhost" and "127.0.0.1" do the same thing, as is sane, unlike mysql.)
[06:43] Aria: (No magic "use unix domain sockets when we see the hostname "localhost"")
[06:43] RushPL: and I don't get it what's the emitter.setMaxListeners
[06:43] konobi: rails might be using a domain socket
[06:44] Aria: RushPL: Whatever you're calling 'on' on, that's an emitter. It's just got a warning on it if you add a lot of listeners, since that's usually a bug. IF not, you can raise the limit.
[06:44] carter-thaxton has joined the channel
[06:45] Aria: (are you perhaps adding a listener in a loop or event?)
[06:46] RushPL: Aria: but what exactly is a listener anyway?
[06:46] RushPL: there is only one thread and one port :)
[06:46] Aria: Well, it's node, so of course there's only one thread ;-)
[06:46] rudyl313: Aria: tried using 192.168.10.34 and getting the same error... my next tactic is to just use the same username as my system username
[06:46] konobi: RushPL: if the connection info you can use just "host=''" and it will use a domain socket
[06:46] Aria: rudyl313: Sounds like it's ignoring the host info.
[06:47] Aria: konobi: I think the problem is that it /is/ using unix domain.
[06:47] RushPL: I have: server.listen(8081); var io = io.listen(server);
[06:47] rudyl313: Aria: well that worked at least
[06:47] RushPL: so io.setMaxListeners ?
[06:47] Aria: (or you could change "ident" to "md5", so it always uses a password.)
[06:47] konobi: Aria: in that case it would need to be "host='localhost'"
[06:48] RushPL: konobi: I don't think this answers my question :P
[06:48] Aria: konobi: Or fix the actual problem ;-)
[06:48] Aria: RushPL: Sure. If you do need to increase the number of listeners. What's "io" there?
[06:48] Aria: (that looks suspect, RushPL.)
[06:48] konobi: http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/postgresql/vol2/DatabaseConnectionControlFunctions.html
[06:48] konobi: PQconnectdb
[06:49] konobi: same string is passed through by the node_postgres C bindingd
[06:49] RushPL: Aria: io = require('../node-bin') where there is an index.js with "module.exports = require('./lib/socket.io');"
[06:49] admc has joined the channel
[06:49] RushPL: (I don't quite get how this including works and paths but it works for now :P)
[06:50] Aria: Heh, odd to chain requires like that, but I suppose that works. So 'io' is socket.io. I see.
[06:50] teddy_ has joined the channel
[06:51] Aria: I doubt that's what's triggering that warning, then.
[06:51] Aria: What event handlers do you have? (foo.on stuff)
[06:51] carter-thaxton has left the channel
[06:52] rudyl313: Aria: I appreciate the help, I'm really just fooling around with geddy to check it out, so the solution of using the system username is fine with me :)
[06:52] Aria: Sweet!
[06:52] Aria: Glad to help.
[06:52] RushPL: Aria: is there a readup I can do how the includes work? I tried copying lib/socket.io to my dir and doing a require'./lib/socket.io) but it didn't work
[06:52] RushPL: Aria: on message, connection, disconnection
[06:52] RushPL: so pretty straightforward :)
[06:53] Aria: Hm. And no "on" inside the function passed to another "on" ?
[06:53] RushPL: the warning shows only on xhr-polling
[06:53] RushPL: Aria: that's a good question, sec
[06:53] Aria: Hm. And xhr-polling calls event handlers more often.
[06:53] Aria: So more likely to trigger it.
[06:53] konobi: why is it loading client.js in node?
[06:54] Aria: requires are pretty simple -- search the path; given foo, look for foo/index.js and foo.js for each entry in node path. Then wrap the contents in a function (so they can have local variables) and run it.
[06:55] RushPL: Aria: http://wklej.org/id/460524/ - so you might be right ... is this bad design then? is it better to have a single message handler on io? (never mind the mockup-quality code)
[06:55] Aria: Now, if you get npm involved, the .js files you find most obviously load other more hidden .js files.
[06:55] RushPL: I intend to have hundreds of connections
[06:55] shinmei has joined the channel
[06:55] Aria: Hm. That doesn't look too crazy -- but is "client" a persistent thing, where the same event might get a prior client?
[06:56] Aria: Or is the client created anew each time? (I don't know socket.io offhand.)
[06:56] Aria: If that 'client' you're given is possibly re-used for each connection, it'd make sense that you overflow the listener list.
[06:57] RushPL: client is persistent for each connection afaik.
[06:57] RushPL: if that's what you're asking.
[06:57] blaines has joined the channel
[06:57] RushPL: so I am adding number_of_clients * 3 listeners?
[06:58] Aria: No, not if that's true -- only 3 to each client object, if it's only passed one by socket.io.
[06:58] amerine has joined the channel
[06:58] Aria: No overflow there.

[07:07] Aria: socket.io's example code on their front page seems to indicate you're doing it right, and the recent warnings added to node just caught them doing sneaky things.

[08:08] desaiu: without the user seeing www.foobar.com:8080 in the address bar
[08:14] kawaz_air has joined the channel
[08:15] fangel: desaiu: well, then you need something that forwards (proxies) your port 80 to whatever port you run node on (like NginX)..

[08:17] devdrinker has joined the channel
[08:17] andrewfff has joined the channel
[08:18] desaiu: fangel: won't that slow down requests?
[08:19] fangel: well, for a long time (might still be the case) it was recommended to run Node behind NginX
[08:19] desaiu: i mean, will it slow down node.js, wouldn't it be faster for the user to communicate directly to node.js 
[08:19] desaiu: hmm
[08:19] ttpva has joined the channel
[08:20] fangel: anyways, the obvious answer is "run node on port 80, be happy".. but since you asked on how to run it on a non-80 port with the user using port 80, proxy it..
[08:21] jakehow has joined the channel
[08:21] kristsk: use nginx and "backends"
[08:22] mytrile has joined the channel
[08:22] kristsk: multiple instances of same process (if applicable for your business logic) gives better fault tolerance
[08:22] desaiu: fangel: i would love to run it on port 80 and be happy, but there are permission errors
[08:23] kristsk: port 80 requires root permissions on all unices, afaik
[08:23] desaiu: and node is installed to one specific user, me, and not globally installed
[08:23] fangel: well, you always need super-user permissions to bind to any port lower than 1024.. same applies to nginx/apache/whatever
[08:25] andrewfff has joined the channel
[08:25] desaiu: oh well, i will be happy with running it as root i suppose
[08:25] desaiu: that just doesn't seem safe 
[08:26] jesusabdullah: You can proxy that stuff, I think
[08:26] kristsk: why not front it with nginx ?
[08:26] desaiu: what's the advantage of using nginx as a proxy?
[08:27] kristsk: i belive you will run out of other resources long before nginx-node communication penalty becomes an issue
[08:27] kristsk: well, does that server have nginx ?
[08:27] desaiu: yes
[08:28] kristsk: does it run on port 80, as you require?
[08:28] desaiu: it does
[08:28] admc: any node ninjas have a second to help me out
[08:28] desaiu: but i don't have it running right now
[08:28] desaiu: i'm not being stubborn, just don't understand what the point of a proxy is
[08:28] kristsk: does your business logic (in node.js app) allow simultanous requests?
[08:29] jesusabdullah: I believe many people don't proxy, though
[08:29] desaiu: yes
[08:29] kristsk: point is that it allows you to route/multiplex node processes 
[08:29] desaiu: why would you need multiple node processes?
[08:29] jesusabdullah: The point of proxcying is that you can have a "trusted" app accept port 80 requests and pass them to a not-so-trusted node instance
[08:29] jesusabdullah: if that's what you want
[08:30] kristsk: if that server has more than 1 core then there would be performance gain from more than 1 node proces at same time
[08:30] jesusabdullah: You MAY want more node instances to parallelize code
[08:30] jesusabdullah: Many projects use node itself to procxy requests, in one way or another
[08:30] desaiu: so you are looking at performance boosts by running multiple node instances
[08:30] kristsk: + nginx gives free load balancing 
[08:31] kristsk: you even can have node processes on different boxes.
[08:31] desaiu: alright, i'll give it a shot
[08:31] jesusabdullah: desaiu: I would argue that nginx may not be right for you.
[08:31] desaiu: oh jesus, why is that?
[08:31] pkrumins: i personally prefer lighttpd
[08:32] desaiu: (pun intended)
[08:32] kristsk: i prefer nginx, and i doubt it does matter right now.
[08:33] jesusabdullah: I guess I feel like it 's a lot of hullaballoo for just one node app
[08:33] andrewfff has joined the channel
[08:33] jesusabdullah: then again, running something you wrote as root? Yecch
[08:33] kristsk: yeah, thats probably not a good idea.
[08:35] jesusabdullah: lighttpd or nginx are good proxying solutions, but I hope you think for yourself. :)
[08:35] jesusabdullah: As silly as that sounds for something like that <_>

[09:05] felixge: but that's just me
[09:06] andrewfff has joined the channel

[09:16] pkrumins: felixge: coming along good, we're now raising money
[09:16] pkrumins: so doing all kinds of things that are related to money raising process.
[09:16] felixge: pkrumins: ah, that will keep you busy for a while

[09:17] pkrumins: so we got to close a round by then
[09:17] felixge: pkrumins: btw. how do you guys handle deployment? Do you kill all active connections?
[09:17] felixge: pkrumins: should be doable, what you do is really hot
[09:17] pkrumins: yeah
[09:17] pkrumins: i am currently implementing a demployment system
[09:17] razvandimescu has joined the channel
[09:17] pkrumins: sorry, deployment system.
[09:18] pkrumins: just started working on that
[09:18] felixge: pkrumins: we have the same problem : )
[09:18] felixge: pkrumins: our plan is to use a master->worker setup with socketpair()
[09:18] pkrumins: but until now i just killed the servers when the queue was empty
[09:18] felixge: pkrumins: so deployment just means new workers and old workers shutting down
[09:18] pkrumins: or sometimes just kill with active users. depends on what the changes were.
[09:18] pkrumins: felixge: we have an easier situation
[09:19] pkrumins: felixge: (i think)
[09:19] felixge: pkrumins: tell me!
[09:19] felixge: : )
[09:19] blaines has joined the channel
[09:19] pkrumins: felixge: we know when a server becomes "free"

[09:19] xla has joined the channel
[09:19] felixge: pkrumins: we have uploads running for 8 hours, we'll soon reach the point where our server is *never* free
[09:19] pkrumins: oh no!
[09:20] felixge: but yeah, that is an easier solution if you can do it
[09:20] felixge: : )
[09:20] felixge: but it's ok, we also want to isolate each upload in it's own process
[09:20] felixge: since exceptions shouldn't take down other uploads
[09:20] felixge: the people waiting 8 hours won't like it
[09:20] felixge: :)
[09:20] pkrumins: right!
[09:21] felixge: pkrumins: but yeah, I suspect we're one of the few node services that have this problem. Most people don't need to deal with those long sessions
[09:21] felixge: or at least they can easily offload theirs to a storage
[09:21] felixge: which we can't do with active connections
[09:22] pkrumins: yep
[09:22] pkrumins: i'll try to generalize this problem and make it a separate github project
[09:23] hellp has joined the channel
[09:23] felixge: pkrumins: cool. I looked into that for our solution as well, but I think our requirements are fairly unique, it'd be a huge headache to generalize

[09:30] clarkfischer has joined the channel

[10:50] felixge: interesting
[10:50] ryah_: but basically the new api will be http.request({ host: 'google.com', port: 80, path: '/'}, cb)
[10:50] felixge: no support for url: "..." ?

[10:51] ryah_: yeah we can probably put the url in

[10:56] tanepiper: Edinburgh
[10:56] pyrotechnick: do it yourself
[10:56] pyrotechnick: it doesnt take much
[10:56] pyrotechnick: just a free room at a library or uni or something
[10:56] pyrotechnick: some pizza
[10:56] pyrotechnick: done.
[10:56] tanepiper: i am, but it's trying to drum up intererest - we have a tool here: bloop.co
[10:57] tanepiper: developed by some local people for getting these things organised
[10:57] pyrotechnick: meetup.com is what we use in AUS
[10:57] pyrotechnick: ill check that out though
[10:57] tanepiper: yea, today it's getting a new release as well
[10:57] pyrotechnick: .co's are so cool
[10:57] tanepiper: I was with the devs last night
[10:57] pyrotechnick: i hate columbia but their domains are just so damn cool
[10:57] tanepiper: should be going out today
[10:57] pyrotechnick: we got feisty.co
[10:58] altamic has joined the channel
[10:58] mnbvasd: ACTION likes cook islands domains.
[10:58] tanepiper: youlovetheco.ck
[10:58] squeeky: reminds me, I need to invest in some swiss domains.
[10:59] mnbvasd: ACTION snickers like a 3 year old.

[11:01] pyrotechnick: why do oath implementations even have deny buttons
[11:01] pyrotechnick: can i get an invite to bloop.co?
[11:01] pyrotechnick: tanepiper: ^^
[11:02] tanepiper: don't have any invites, but ping them on twitter and they will throw one over - say @tanepiper sent you to check it out and you want to organise some tech meets
[11:03] tanepiper: you know what domains would be cool, .js
[11:03] pyrotechnick: yeah
[11:03] pyrotechnick: or .coffee
[11:03] pyrotechnick: :p
[11:03] tanepiper: then you could do <script src="jquery.js">
[11:03] tanepiper: and it would be the jQuery script in a domain
[11:03] pyrotechnick: oh man
[11:04] pyrotechnick: that's a fucking sick idea
[11:04] pyrotechnick: although
[11:04] pyrotechnick: ud need the http://
[11:04] pyrotechnick: but still
[11:04] tanepiper: true
[11:04] mnbvasd: and need to create a new country.
[11:04] pyrotechnick: u know there
[11:04] tanepiper: mnbvasd: no need, with ICANN changes there will soon be more non-geo domains
[11:05] pyrotechnick: there's almost twice as many .net's as .com's
[11:05] tanepiper: there is already a bunch like .biz, .mobi, .tel, etc
[11:05] mnbvasd: tanepiper: are they freeing up 2 letter lds?

[11:05] pyrotechnick: wow look how many australian ones there are
[11:05] pyrotechnick: we must like the internet
[11:05] tanepiper: mnbvasd: possibly, it's not 100% may only be 3 or more
[11:06] tanepiper: but then you can have .twitter domains, so instead of twitter.com/tanepiper you would have tanepiper.twitter
[11:06] pyrotechnick: im not sure i agree with that one
[11:06] pyrotechnick: it's cool
[11:06] pyrotechnick: but i think it goes into a place we dont want to go

[11:07] bzinger: anyone have experience develop mobile sites?
[11:07] pyrotechnick: just to have a cool name
[11:07] tanepiper: yea, i just make it that it's technically feasible
[11:07] pyrotechnick: ja bzinger
[11:07] tanepiper: not that it's a good idea
[11:07] devdrinker has joined the channel
[11:07] bzinger: pyrotechnick: how do you do the debugging ?
[11:07] pyrotechnick: on what platform
[11:08] pyrotechnick: with iphone you have a few options
[11:08] pyrotechnick: you can turn on the console in the settings of mobile safari
[11:08] pyrotechnick: or you can tether it to xcode and use the console there
[11:08] bzinger: i trying not to be depend on platform, so thinking to do a site
[11:08] pyrotechnick: yeah but i mean what device
[11:08] pyrotechnick: it depends on the device and browser
[11:08] bzinger: iphone and android
[11:08] pyrotechnick: ok android i cant help you with i imagine it's similar
[11:09] pyrotechnick: there'll be a console and you'll be able to tether it to an IDE or some kind of SDK
[11:09] bzinger: what about iphone?
[11:09] TurboAWAY has joined the channel
[11:09] pyrotechnick: same thing
[11:09] pyrotechnick: you can enable the dev console in settings (google it)
[11:09] pyrotechnick: and you can tether to dashcode and xcode
[11:09] bzinger: how do you actually tether mobile safari's console output to xcode 
[11:09] pyrotechnick: there's like a list of devices
[11:10] bzinger: i know how to turn on dev console in iphone, but don't know how to get it back to xcode
[11:10] pyrotechnick: not sure on the specifics i'm just aware it can be done
[11:10] pyrotechnick: let me have a look matey
[11:10] bzinger: also how can you do inspect elements stuff in mobiile safari :) 
[11:10] pyrotechnick: u cant lol

[11:11] zomgbie has joined the channel
[11:11] pyrotechnick: so it must be somewhat useful
[11:12] bzinger: yeah, i really want some kind of webkit inspector in mobile safari 
[11:12] pyrotechnick: mmm
[11:12] d0k has joined the channel
[11:12] mape: firebug lite won't worK?
[11:12] pyrotechnick: it would be too small to be usable
[11:12] pyrotechnick: wouldnt it
[11:12] chapel: couldn
[11:12] pyrotechnick: i dunno that seems difficult
[11:12] chapel: couldn't you use the ipad
[11:13] chapel: its the same safari version no?
[11:13] pyrotechnick: yep
[11:13] chapel: larger screen
[11:13] pyrotechnick: depends how much of his code relys on size that kind of thing
[11:13] chapel: yeah
[11:13] Lorentz: I want that noteslate already
[11:13] chapel: other than that, jailbreak the iphone
[11:13] pyrotechnick: but yeahj thats a good point
[11:13] chapel: should have more options then
[11:13] pyrotechnick: yeah
[11:13] pyrotechnick: i have seen it done though mate
[11:13] bzinger: i guess i just need to debug mobile site on my desktop 
[11:13] pyrotechnick: from dashcode
[11:13] pyrotechnick: bzinger: your best bet is to get webkit
[11:14] altamic has joined the channel
[11:14] pyrotechnick: resize it to the same size as iphone
[11:14] chapel: chrome and safari
[11:14] pyrotechnick: and spoof the user agent
[11:14] chapel: since they are birthed from the same code base, but have their own quirks
[11:14] pyrotechnick: in case ur doing any iphone specific stuff on the server
[11:14] bzinger: yeah spoof  user agent is i'm looking atm
[11:14] kiddphunk_ has joined the channel
[11:14] pyrotechnick: i dunno about safari
[11:14] bzinger: there is plugin for chrome 
[11:14] pyrotechnick: but theres plugins for chrome and ff
[11:14] squeeky: use Safari, enable debug mode in the preferences, change the UA (iphone/ipad/ipod touch UAs are in by default)
[11:14] chapel: so what are you trying to do bzinger ?
[11:14] chapel: just design stuff, or server side stuff
[11:15] bzinger: chapel: mainly design stuff, i can debug server side stuff pretty easily 
[11:15] chapel: okay
[11:15] chapel: well have you thought of flexible designs?
[11:15] bzinger: i just want the same webkit debug inspector or firebug for mobile 
[11:15] chapel: http://lessframework.com/
[11:16] bzinger: chapel: yeah, flexible designs is what we using, but i want  to be able to inspect element and check out css and js etc 
[11:16] booo has joined the channel
[11:16] chapel: that should take a lot of the hard work out of making a design for big and small screens
[11:16] chapel: sure
[11:16] chapel: well your main issue is how it looks, so matching screensize is possible on desktop
[11:17] chapel: the specific issues involved with either platform, is something different
[11:17] bzinger: chapel: true
[11:18] rjrodger: bzinger: I use desktop safari -> emulator -> device
[11:18] rjrodger: you can get about 95% done on desktop safari
[11:18] rjrodger: there are diffs but in practice you're ok
[11:18] pyrotechnick: wow
[11:18] pyrotechnick: that framework is sick
[11:19] bzinger: rjrodger: what emulator?
[11:19] chapel: I know the iphone emulator runs fast
[11:19] chapel: so as long as you aren't concerned about 1:1 speed, it its an up to date ios emulator
[11:20] chapel: so that is one way to test
[11:20] davidsklar has joined the channel
[11:20] bzinger: yeah iphone emulator is pretty fast, android emulator take ages to start up :( 
[11:20] chapel: of course, it wont make using firebug or whatever easier
[11:20] chapel: but its on a desktop
[11:20] chapel: heh yeah
[11:20] chapel: the android emulator takes time because it is actually emulating the hardware
[11:20] davidsklar has joined the channel
[11:20] chapel: very slow hardware
[11:21] davidsklar1 has joined the channel
[11:21] pyrotechnick: hey im jew for an upgrade, iphone 4 or desire HD?

[11:22] pyrotechnick: thanks mate
[11:22] chapel: pyrotechnick: umm
[11:22] chapel: what do you want from your phone?
[11:22] chapel: tanepiper: invite to what?
[11:22] rjrodger: bzinger: iphone emulator that comes with xcode or the android emulator with eclipse
[11:22] tanepiper: pyrotechnick: depends what you want out of the device
[11:22] davidsklar has joined the channel
[11:22] pyrotechnick: chapel: umm
[11:22] pyrotechnick: chapel: webgl
[11:22] rjrodger: for web apps you just create a home screen bookmark - nifty!
[11:22] chapel: android would get it faster
[11:22] bzinger: rjrodger: actually you can run your android emulator seperately 
[11:22] chapel: since google is pushing it
[11:22] JRowe: webgl = teh secks
[11:23] tanepiper: iPhone 4 is a nice device but i personally have issues with the way Apple run their app store and developer programs
[11:23] rjrodger: emulator ~ simulator...
[11:23] chapel: but I dont think its in there yet
[11:23] pyrotechnick: JRowe: elaborate
[11:23] chapel: wouldn't be hard to build a browser with it though
[11:23] tanepiper: and i like that i can install my own version of Android on my Desire
[11:23] JRowe: copperlicht for webgl
[11:23] davidsklar has joined the channel
[11:23] pyrotechnick: copperlicht sucks arse
[11:23] JRowe: pure awesomeness
[11:23] chapel: tanepiper: same
[11:23] pyrotechnick: but copperlicht != webgl
[11:23] pyrotechnick: three.js rapes copperlicht
[11:23] pyrotechnick: in all holes
[11:24] JRowe: webgl capabilities, the implication of the whole deal

[11:24] chapel: tanepiper: I just put on cyanogenmod 7 nightly, so awesome
[11:24] pyrotechnick: it's a bit too late now
[11:24] pyrotechnick: webgl will be final soon

[11:24] davidsklar has joined the channel
[11:24] tanepiper: chapel: on, is 7 based on 2.3?  I've got 6.1 or 6.2 on there
[11:24] chapel: cool tanepiper
[11:24] rjrodger: bzinger:must try that. In any case, as a dev cycle it's quite workable, even with the small wierd differences
[11:24] JRowe: been trying to get it on my tablet, no luck so far
[11:25] chapel: yeah gingerbread
[11:25] davidsklar has joined the channel
[11:25] pyrotechnick: JRowe: i've run it on iphones and androids
[11:25] bzinger: rjrodger: yeah, android doesn't try to tie you down to specific IDE 
[11:25] JRowe: webgl?
[11:25] pyrotechnick: ja
[11:25] pyrotechnick: not in safari though
[11:25] tanepiper: I saw the new NDK release for 2.3 and I'm wondering if it'll make it possible to compile nodejs for android easier
[11:25] pyrotechnick: fennec
[11:25] JRowe: ahh, cool - got a link to making it work?
[11:25] davidsklar has joined the channel
[11:25] pyrotechnick: fennec pretty much compiles without a problem
[11:25] pyrotechnick: it looks shitty
[11:26] chapel: tanepiper: well I would think so, since its easier to use
[11:26] JRowe: i can get a nightly build np
[11:26] pyrotechnick: like its not a cocoa app
[11:26] chapel: though I dont know the specifics
[11:26] tanepiper: so you could write applications in javascript rather than java, and use webkit as the interface
[11:26] chapel: as far as 2.3, it is so nice, it is actually faster on my n1

[11:26] JimBastard: Yesterday we sent a very nice email to Marak Squires literally asking him what we could to do make things right. He has not responded. Perhaps he's lawyering up, deleting his Facebook account, and hitting the gym.
[11:26] JimBastard: wtf ?!?
[11:26] tanepiper: pyrotechnick: yea i looked into it before and it's nice, but it still not pure js

[11:32] pyrotechnick: julienXX: npm install redis?
[11:32] pyrotechnick: is that the one?
[11:32] JRowe: you can use scripting layer for android, theRhino interpreter, and run everything out of a webview

[11:32] julienXX: pyrotechnick: yeah but I would like to kinda bundle it with my app

[11:33] pyrotechnick: yep
[11:33] pyrotechnick: npm can do it
[11:33] JRowe: http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/
[11:33] julienXX: pyrotechnick: ah ok thanks!
[11:33] chapel: JimBastard: I see node.js more like a new neighborhood, there are a lot of people coming, some have taken lots and are building houses, a few companies are setting up shop, most are coming in watching to see how it goes, and even more come in, and leave, come in and leave
[11:33] chapel: so if that is a ghetto then sure
[11:33] davidsklar has joined the channel
[11:33] JRowe: there's a bit of discussion, but Rhino's got complete access to all the java API
[11:33] pyrotechnick: julienXX: http://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/doc/install.mdbundle

[11:35] tanepiper: JRowe: why should I need to think about Java at all, in a perfect world I'd compile nodejs nativly for android, the binary would be included in the APK and I should be able to call it directly and itself do stuff in C++ land
[11:35] davidsklar has joined the channel
[11:35] tanepiper: since the NDK lives in C++ land
[11:35] JRowe: because in android, everything is sitting in Java land

[11:37] chapel: but ultimately, ndk has full device access
[11:37] davidsklar has joined the channel
[11:37] tanepiper: not everything, but file and network access are - and that's mainly what nodejs needs
[11:37] chapel: minus some things
[11:37] davidsklar1 has joined the channel
[11:37] Kingdutch has joined the channel
[11:38] chapel: honestly, if you want to use node.js on android for gui apps, someone is going to have to build a c++ plugin or something for those gui bindings, and then it should be cake
[11:39] JRowe: node.js should work ootb with sl4a, compiling a v8 interpreter would be trivial
[11:39] pyrotechnick: http://nodefu.com/ <-> http://www.nodejitsu.com/.
[11:39] pyrotechnick: is that what they're bitching about
[11:39] pyrotechnick: the names...
[11:39] pyrotechnick: which one is called nodefu
[11:39] pyrotechnick: yours JimBastard?
[11:39] chapel: no
[11:39] JRowe: not particularly
[11:39] chapel: his is nodejitsu
[11:40] mraleph: JRowe: v8 is _not_ an interpreter.
[11:40] chapel: and his has been around for a year
[11:40] JRowe: ahh.
[11:40] chapel: also pyrotechnick the guy behind nodefu used some open source code from nodejitsu
[11:40] chapel: not that using the code is an issue
[11:41] JRowe: jit compiler?
[11:41] JRowe: whats the correct thing to call it?
[11:41] mraleph: yes or just a VM :-)
[11:41] JRowe: kk
[11:41] chapel: but that having a name similar like that when you obviously knew it existed, seems disingenuous
[11:41] JRowe: yeah, i usually have vm in mind when i say interpreter
[11:41] sriley: isnt it just that he signed up to a few but didnt get a response back so made his own? im assumeing jitsu was in the list of ones he tried?
[11:42] sriley: (no idea if jitsu has a waiting list)
[11:42] JimBastard: sriley: we do, it has almost 2k people on it
[11:42] chapel: sriley: he did say I guess that nodejitsu was one that he was waiting on
[11:42] chapel: good on him for making one
[11:43] JimBastard: sriley: we arent opening up to the public until we know the service will be "good". nodefu has already gone down several times in the past few days. i read through the code for nodefu, and its a joke
[11:43] chapel: but its not that hard to come up with a name that isn't similar, in this case isn't about letters, and more about how it sounds
[11:43] JimBastard: its some of the better node.js libraries wrapped up in some horrible spaghetti code
[11:43] JimBastard: i gotta go do some real work before this gets me all upset

[11:52] JRowe: depends on how deep into android you get, tho - lots of limits just from the browser level
[11:52] chapel: stagas: I might have to load that up for my forum

[11:58] stagas: chapel: yeah I know usually it falls back to xhr polling
[11:59] stagas: chapel: but in your case you may be having a js error so socket.io never gets the chance
[11:59] chapel: yeah idk
[11:59] chapel: doesn't work on dolphin either
[12:00] sriley: some android phones have a flash lite sort of thing that socket.io may pick up and use but doesnt really work
[12:00] chapel: sriley: I have a nexus one with 2.3 and full flash

[12:03] chapel: yeah

[12:27] chapel: I was using sammy.js
[12:27] chapel: love the ease of sammy.js
[12:28] chapel: but for a couchapp, you would have to build two versions of your app, one client, one serverside
[12:28] tanepiper: i mean i'm using ExtJS at the moment, but the app itself you need to log in anyway, there is no public face of it except for a drupal website that will be going up
[12:28] chapel: with kanso, you can build it once and it works clientside ajaxy and serverside sans js
[12:29] chapel: I am building a forum as a couchapp

[14:00] pagameba: fairwinds: caveat, I'm pretty sure I used it with a php backend, not express, so mileage will vary :)
[14:01] tanepiper: Express > any PHP backend that ever existed at any time

[14:26] Aikar: yeah thats what im asking for help with

[14:29] tiemonster: I'm looking for a reasonable starting point to begin contributing. Any ideas on where to look?
[14:30] jimt has joined the channel
[14:31] Aikar: tiemonster: like im doing too, need to learn git lol. but id say think of something you yourself need for your own stuff, as imo the quality of something is affected wether or not you are writing it for yourself to use (ie if you dont intend to use it, you are likely not to give it as much attention), then simply release it to public
[14:31] guybrush: Aikar imho the better solution is to just add multiple remotes, one for github, one for your gitosisserver, ...
[14:31] guybrush: this is so much clearer
[14:31] Aikar: guybrush: yeah i know but that requires me to do 2 pushes which i know im gonna end up forgetting to do 1 lol
[14:32] tiemonster: we're building a real-time application that will utilize geospatial data
[14:32] tiemonster: I had considered writing a node wrapper for geos
[14:32] guybrush: Aikar: you will need your ssh-key on the gitosis-server to push from your gitosis-server to your repo
[14:33] Aikar: so build the data set gathering and reporting as a library itself, and then release that, and can put an application use case example as part of the lib
[14:33] guybrush: if that key is passworded you got your first problem :)
[14:33] heavysixer has joined the channel
[14:33] Aikar: guybrush: well its really a 1 person server (me), so i dont password my keys
[14:33] Aikar: my usb drive i keep it on for work is encrypted :P
[14:33] Aikar: i keep my keys secure
[14:33] guybrush: right, but MY key is on MY computer and nowhere else
[14:34] tiemonster: I was looking for something less niche to do first, but node.js has a surprisingly large ecosystem already
[14:34] guybrush: even not on any machine which is only accessable by me
[14:34] Aikar: lol
[14:34] guybrush: you will end up with having your private-key spreaded arround on multiple machines you cant even remember :p
[14:34] guybrush: that's not cool
[14:35] Aikar: guybrush: well if i was worried about my main key i could gen a new one and add it to my git account :P
[14:36] Kingdutch has joined the channel
[14:36] guybrush: right, you would have to update the public keys everywhere
[14:36] Aikar: gitosis does a fairly good job at locking down the ssh account.
[14:36] Aikar: no, only for github
[14:36] guybrush: anyway, it is my opinion may not be the best
[14:36] Aikar: i mean to only use this is for my git repo -> github for my public repos
[14:36] Aikar: as id like to keep a copy of my own source code on my own server too since i have my own git server
[14:37] guybrush: that is good, i like that
[14:37] guybrush: dont rely on github
[14:38] Aikar: is a lil silly to say 'yeah i have a git server but that X project isnt on it' lol
[14:38] guybrush: right, i am doing it with multiple remotes
[14:38] guybrush: you can do it with hooks
[14:38] guybrush: it is very simple
[14:38] guybrush: just make an executable file
[14:38] Aikar: which is fine and is what im doing for now, im just lazy and trying to see if i can make it do the work for me :P
[14:38] claudiu__ has joined the channel
[14:39] Aikar: im lil confused on what dir would i use the git push github command in on the bare repo tho

[14:39] Aikar: making a line like so
[14:39] Aikar: ../../../pushto nova git@github.com:Aikar/node-nova.git
[14:40] Aikar: which will cd to the nova.git repo on my server then push it to github at that url
[14:41] guybrush: in the repo-folder on your gitosis-server there is a dir called hooks
[14:41] guybrush: there are already some example hooks in it
[14:41] guybrush: you just have to make em executable
[14:41] chrischr_ has joined the channel
[14:42] Aikar: yeah i know but im trying to figure out what dir would i run 'git push github'
[14:42] Aikar: or would it be fine to run that directly in the post-receive?
[14:43] guybrush: first you have to add your ssh-key to the user who is executing the hook
[14:44] Me1000 has joined the channel
[14:44] pagameba: tiemonster: I started some geospatial modules for node.js - https://github.com/pagameba/node-mapserver and I've got some code written for ogr too but i didn't get it into github yet
[14:45] tiemonster: pagameba: js or C++?
[14:45] pagameba: tiemonster either would perhaps be a good starting point for wrapping geos

[14:45] pagameba: tiemonster: C++ node extension wrapping the underlying libraries
[14:46] blacktron has joined the channel
[14:46] guybrush: then you will want to add github as remote on your gitosis-server-repo

[14:47] tiemonster: yeah - if I wrote a node library, it would be to expose the utility functions exposed in geos: distance calcs, coordinates class, geospatial geometry, etc.
[14:47] guybrush: anyway, i recommend asking this in #git since it is slightly offtopic here :p

[15:47] tiemonster: Our software engineering class has been tasked with contributing to an open source project by Feb 4
[15:47] tiemonster: in C++
[15:47] tiemonster: a very vague assignment...
[15:48] tanepiper: well i'm sure there is C++ level stuff in nodejs that can be improved
[15:48] piscisaureus: tiemonster: is 'contribute' really all you need to do? You could fix a spelling bug :-)
[15:49] tanepiper: maybe look at typed arrays in v8 :)
[15:49] squeeky: tanepiper: needs more coroutines!
[15:49] tiemonster: he's going to arbitrarily let us know when we're "done"
[15:49] piscisaureus: ah
[15:49] tiemonster: we have 7 people in the class, so 7 bug fixes would be acceptable
[15:49] tiemonster: or one new wicked cool feature
[15:50] piscisaureus: squeeky: coroutines will never be accepted
[15:50] tiemonster: doesn't have to be accepted ;-)
[15:50] tiemonster: just submitted
[15:50] piscisaureus: :-/
[15:50] tiemonster: lol
[15:50] piscisaureus: why add tetris() to libc
[15:50] piscisaureus: then
[15:51] squeeky: piscisaureus: I know. That's the joke.
[15:51] tiemonster: isn't 0.3.5 latest stable? a lot of these issues seem related to 0.1.x
[15:51] piscisaureus: 0.3 is not stable, and it will never be
[15:51] tanepiper: 0.3.x is never stable
[15:51] squeeky: odds/evens here?
[15:51] isaacs has joined the channel
[15:51] piscisaureus: yup
[15:51] tiemonster: ah
[15:51] tiemonster: 0.2.x
[15:51] tiemonster: still
[15:51] saschagehlich: oops: https://github.com/translate?to=/
[15:52] bradleymeck: tiemonster, get us a simple gmp wrapper so we have bignums, wouldn't be too hard even
[15:52] tanepiper: tiemonster: i'm sure you can ask isaacs if there is anything needs done :)  or ryah_ when he's around later
[15:52] piscisaureus: tiemonster: you can work on the windows porting project
[15:52] tiemonster: I'm here all day. I really need to find *something* by the end of the day.
[15:53] tiemonster: piscisaureus: what are the barriers?
[15:53] tjholowaychuk: bradleymeck: aaron was toying around with that: https://github.com/aheckmann/node-gmp
[15:53] tanepiper: tbh that might be out of your scope - unless you get all 7 of you on it
[15:53] tiemonster: which would be fine
[15:53] tanepiper: there is a lot to be done for windows native port
[15:53] tiemonster: but we only have 2 weeks
[15:54] piscisaureus: tiemonster doesn't need to do it all
[15:54] tiemonster: we're building a real-time geospatial app after that
[15:54] piscisaureus: you could make udp fork work windows, or fix some tests
[15:54] CrazyGoogle: will be https client code that works with 0.2.6 work with feature stable 0.4.x ?
[15:54] tiemonster: so if we build something related to that, there's more motivation to use node for the second project
[15:54] tanepiper: but if you do good work, you shall be known as the magnificant 7 :D
[15:54] rpflo has joined the channel
[15:54] CrazyGoogle: actualy https client looks not working for me with 0.3.x
[15:54] tiemonster: fixing tests is definitely in-scope
[15:55] tiemonster: tanepiper: don't hold your breath
[15:55] Aikar: 'stable' refers to the API to a degree. if you install .3.5 and never update then its 'api stable' but i think some things could be non functioning like https client. but any time you update .3.x ryan could of changed an api name / method / etc
[15:55] bradleymeck: i did not know gmp forced aborts @_@
[15:55] piscisaureus: tiemonster: it depends on what your teacher wants
[15:55] MikhX has joined the channel
[15:55] piscisaureus: fixing tests would be easy
[15:55] Aikar: where as .2.x ryan is not changing the current api, only fixing bugs/security
[15:55] piscisaureus: I reckon fixing upd would eb as well
[15:55] tiemonster: he'd want us to do something else alongside that
[15:56] tiemonster: 7 fixed tests and some code documentation would probably do it
[15:56] tiemonster: we were originally looking at LibreOffice, but that thing is behemoth
[15:56] noahcampbell has joined the channel
[15:56] piscisaureus: process.getenv and process.unsetenv you could do

[15:56] isaacs: no thanks.
[15:57] squeeky: isaacs: oh hey, there you are.
[15:57] isaacs: it'd be a bit rude, i think, for me to go to a php meetup and be like, "Hey, you know what's great? Not-your-language!"
[15:57] isaacs: gotta run :)
[15:57] piscisaureus: sounds kinda fun :-)
[15:57] bingomanatee_: oh poo - they'd be cool. 
[15:57] bingomanatee_: the mootools stuff was a hit. 
[15:58] bingomanatee_: Anyway I'm reaching out to Mike T. to see what he says. 
[15:58] bingomanatee_: I don't think the PHP people are under any illusions about where the platform falls short. 
[15:59] bradleymeck: tjholowaychuck, yea... but that doesn't do enough checks to prevent aborts :( and i dont know what causes all the aborts
[15:59] piscisaureus: "I have some suggestions to improve php 1. drop the $ prefix to vars. 2. var hoisting ftw. " 
[15:59] cronopio has joined the channel
[15:59] tiemonster: bingomanatee_: yes, they are
[15:59] piscisaureus: "3 prototypical inheritance" 
[15:59] tiemonster: don't start that list
[16:00] bradleymeck: piscisaureus, i think those are less important than the simple "import encapsulation" problem
[16:00] bradleymeck: but then again browser js has similar issues
[16:00] tjholowaychuk: bradleymeck: dunno, never looked into it
[16:00] piscisaureus: bradleymeck: I don't really like var hoisting :-)
[16:01] bradleymeck: most compilers hoist vars but just throw errors due to parse trees XD
[16:01] tiemonster: piscisaureus: taking one or the other of those might be a good idea
[16:01] piscisaureus: yeah but then you at least have block scope
[16:01] tiemonster: (back to process.*)
[16:01] piscisaureus: tiemonster: go ahead :-)
[16:02] bradleymeck: pfff block scope, non-block multiple hoist resolution is hilarious
[16:02] tanepiper: man, us geeks talk funny sometimes :)
[16:03] saschagehlich: is there some kind of default user agent that HttpClient is using?
[16:03] tjholowaychuk: saschagehlich: I dont think so (AFAIK)
[16:03] tjholowaychuk: saschagehlich: unless you are using some higher level module
[16:03] tiemonster: piscisaureus: how would process.getenv differ from process.env?
[16:04] saschagehlich: hmm okay

[16:07] romainhuet has joined the channel
[16:08] tiemonster: ah - you meant set and unset
[16:08] piscisaureus: you need to use the windows API directly (SetEnvironmentVariableW). Different from setenv, it uses UCS-16 instead of UTF-8
[16:08] piscisaureus: yeah sorry
[16:08] piscisaureus: had to look it up
[16:08] piscisaureus: did'n remember precisely
[16:08] tiemonster: so those are windows port problems
[16:08] piscisaureus: yeah
[16:09] tiemonster: I get it now
[16:09] piscisaureus: that is the only thing I know about
[16:09] tiemonster: might be doable
[16:09] piscisaureus: tiemonster: see for yourself
[16:09] tiemonster: will do
[16:11] tiemonster: piscisaureus: is there a separate project page for the windows port?
[16:11] piscisaureus: nope
[16:11] tiemonster: are these issues documented as issues, or should I just grep for NO_IMPL_MSG ?
[16:12] tiemonster: in github, that is
[16:12] piscisaureus: NO_IMPL_MSG does nothing but say "hey, this is not implemented"
[16:12] piscisaureus: it should be dropped as soon as it works
[16:12] piscisaureus: tiemonster: https://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/TODO.win32 is a todo list
[16:13] tiemonster: perfect. that's what I meant.
[16:13] piscisaureus: but it may be above your head a little bit
[16:13] kristsk: Y_U_NO_IMPLEMENTED?

[16:14] piscisaureus: there's no win equivalent

[16:14] piscisaureus: need to discuss it with ryah tho
[16:14] charlenopires_ has joined the channel
[16:15] piscisaureus: kill would probably overload TerminateProcess but you need to think what to do with the signal
[16:16] tiemonster: we could also tackle some of the "Skip/fix tests that can never pass on windows"
[16:16] piscisaureus: tiemonster: if you can do it in an elegant way, sure
[16:17] briznad has joined the channel
[16:17] tiemonster: well, skip at least
[16:17] davidascher has joined the channel
[16:17] piscisaureus: tiemonster: but I think it is hard, actually, because you need to *know* what could and what couldn't be done on windows
[16:17] tiemonster: granted
[16:18] tiemonster: I'll talk to him about the set/unset and see what his reaction is
[16:18] piscisaureus: tiemonster: yeah but I don't want you to skip tests that currently fail because node needs to be fixed
[16:18] jamund has joined the channel
[16:18] piscisaureus: ok
[16:18] tiemonster: wrapping geos is also another option on the table
[16:18] tiemonster: some basic geospatial support in node.js wouldn't hurt anyone
[16:19] piscisaureus: tiemonster: you will not get it into core
[16:19] tiemonster: oh no
[16:19] tiemonster: I'm not proposing that
[16:19] lumino: lol
[16:19] tiemonster: third-party library
[16:19] piscisaureus: yeah, you could do that
[16:19] tiemonster: the whole .node method

[16:43] tiemonster: I'm saying that only a small subset of IMAP's functionality has been standardized
[16:43] tiemonster: the rest is vendor-specific
[16:43] squeeky: ^ that is exactly right.
[16:43] tiemonster: and what standards do exist are not followed by Exchange server

[16:43] squeeky: a0001 CAPABILITY is a good place to start.
[16:43] JiMBastard: is it possible to put a try / catch around a method.apply call? it seems to be squashing the error. try{   mm[m].apply(this, args); } catch(err){   console.log(err); }
[16:44] aklt: Eh!  Is there no decent way to get some data of a mail server?
[16:44] tiemonster: depends on the service
[16:44] tiemonster: are you looking to connect to a specific vendor?
[16:45] tiemonster: there are node.js Gmail apps out there, but they use Gmail's atom feed
[16:46] squeeky: also IMAP, unless using the IDLE capability is pull only - so for event based stuff could have pain.
[16:46] tiemonster: true

[17:18] pyrotechnick: nathel: what OS?
[17:18] nathel: windows 7
[17:18] Wszerad: Win 7 
[17:18] pyrotechnick: im not sure what node builds with on windows
[17:18] pyrotechnick: probably gcc
[17:18] pyrotechnick: meaning you do not have it
[17:19] pyrotechnick: it may be MSVC though
[17:19] pyrotechnick: let me look
[17:19] nathel: i build it with cygwin
[17:19] pyrotechnick: gcc then
[17:19] sriley: i think youll be stuck with cygwin or install a virtual machine
[17:19] pyrotechnick: i really do not know much about cygwin or node on windows i am afraid
[17:20] pyrotechnick: TBH i'd just use a headless OS in a VM
[17:20] pyrotechnick: it's essentially the same as cygwin but you won't have any "windows" problems
[17:20] pyrotechnick: plus it's nice to have snapshots, be able to move it around etc
[17:21] pyrotechnick: it's not a solution to your problem, but it is a fix i think you should both consider

[17:22] nathel: i read a tut' to build  node.js with cygwin and he said :"Tested with node 0.2.5 on Windows 7" i have no luck
[17:22] pyrotechnick: i usually go virtualbox + ubuntu server

[17:29] Aikar: ok im an "up to date and somewhat bleeding edge guy" :P

[17:30] pyrotechnick: generally arrays are smaller than objects
[17:30] pyrotechnick: as well as faster
[17:30] pyrotechnick: generally
[17:30] pyrotechnick: generally * infinity
[17:30] tiemonster: just make sure they're destroyed when you're done with them
[17:30] pyrotechnick: as for less big objects vs more small objects i have NFI

[17:31] tiemonster: lol

[17:31] nsswb has joined the channel
[17:31] tjholowaychuk: pair: for example [50, 100] and point[0] will be much faster than { x: 50, y: 100 } point.x

[17:31] tiemonster: so it occurs to me that node is less of a web application tool and more of a web services tool
[17:31] nsswb has left the channel
[17:32] pyrotechnick: especially things like jeagermonkey and crankshaft the objects will be faster than arrays
[17:32] squeeky: tiemonster: it's beyond "the web" and more towards anything to do with a socket, I think.

[17:34] tjholowaychuk: tiemonster: i think we already have like 5 of each
[17:34] tiemonster: I'm making a monolithic AJAX application at the moment, though, and javascript does not feel us to the task
[17:34] kristsk: twisted is for python that is somewhat like node
[17:34] tiemonster: tjholowaychuk: not nearly as robust, though
[17:34] pyrotechnick: tiemonster: try coffeescript ;)
[17:35] pyrotechnick: #coffeescript
[17:35] tjholowaychuk: tiemonster: meh
[17:35] tiemonster: kristsk: but not as fast
[17:35] squeeky: aklt: imagine the use case scenario where you would want to connect to the server and be told when an email arrives, and have a callback when one does. because IMAP by itself without the IDLE capability doesn't receive notification, it's a pull operation, you couldn't implement a callback on a mail server event - you'd have to poll at interval.
[17:35] marcab: ugh -- coffeescript
[17:35] tjholowaychuk: django seemed kinda lame from what I played with
[17:35] tjholowaychuk: rails slightly less so

[17:37] pyrotechnick: Aikar: write a command?
[17:37] pyrotechnick: to test coffee?
[17:37] tiemonster: kristsk: it's called Trails
[17:37] Aikar: instead of node myfile.js you gotta run coffeescript to compile it then run the .js
[17:37] squeeky: kristsk: struts. enough said.
[17:37] pyrotechnick: please, elaborate
[17:37] pyrotechnick: Aikar: coffee my_file.coffee
[17:37] aklt: squeeky: Although I have seen that in rfc5550 something called IMAP-NOTIFY exists.  I guess that could remedy this isssue.
[17:37] kristsk: struts no dear lord pls.
[17:37] tjholowaychuk: Aikar: you can register the .coffee ext to auto-compile
[17:37] tjholowaychuk: doesnt make it less lame though

[17:38] pyrotechnick: you guys
[17:38] pyrotechnick: you guys are so cool
[17:38] pyrotechnick: i wish i could still write raw js
[17:38] squeeky: aklt: NOTIFY is also an extension of capability, like IDLE, so it might not be everywhere.

[17:38] pyrotechnick: but evertime i try i want to stab my eyes out and cut my hands off
[17:38] bingomanatee: I presonnally think we need a coffe^2 language to write coffee script in

[17:38] tjholowaychuk: hahha

[17:39] squeeky: aklt: the reality is that if you were to talk IMAP with node, you would have to assume that until you receive the response from a CAPABILITY request, it's interval polling. If you get IDLE/NOTIFY, then you can handle eventing over IMAP shenanigans.

[17:53] jesusabdullah: I think there's a draw to trying to somehow make templating less obnoxious, but often the goals of flexibility/features and "cleanliness" fight each other. Even cleanliness fights itself---After all, how do you deal with indentation? Do you strip out the first 4n spaces? Or what?

[18:58] russ_nyc has joined the channel
[18:58] mnbvasd: there's evil involved in passing on listeners... so I just ditch them.
[18:58] konobi: mnbvasd: setting up tls would be blocking though, right?
[18:58] mnbvasd: ryah_: when you're a server you have to wait for the client to start the handshake, and you want to pass in your key/cert.

[18:59] russ_nyc: hi all, i am using caolan's async.  I am trying to nest async.parralel inside async.map
[18:59] russ_nyc: but I dont know how to get the map to return after the parralel has finished
[18:59] dgathright_ has joined the channel
[18:59] konobi: mnbvasd: or at least you would start running into race conditions
[18:59] mnbvasd: konobi: kinda, you'd add a listener to for a signal to of socket secured...
[19:00] SvenDowideit has joined the channel
[19:00] ryah_: konobi: tls is non-blocking
[19:00] mnbvasd: it returns the clear text socket, so you can use that and the data gets buffered.

[19:02] stepheneb has joined the channel
[19:03] mnbvasd: https://gist.github.com/788400
[19:03] mnbvasd: konobi: nothing yet but the current tls stuff.. it's just a minor patch.
[19:04] mnbvasd: konobi: it just uses the current tls code but lets you pass in an existing socket.
[19:04] broofa has joined the channel
[19:04] konobi: mnbvasd: ah... i see
[19:05] coffee has joined the channel
[19:05] konobi: so it will kill the socket entirely if the handshake fails
[19:05] mnbvasd: konobi: I'll hack more as I get more of a test base.

[19:06] brianleroux has joined the channel
[19:06] mnbvasd: konobi: I believe so at the moment, which really isn't good for me, as I need to deal with handshake errors.
[19:07] konobi: yeah, there's a few use cases there... fail and bail, fail and continue in plaintest, fail and retry with a new cypher, fail and retry with another cert, etc.
[19:07] tilgovi has joined the channel
[19:08] ryah_: mnbvasd: i think .upgrade() should also be used for server-side sockets
[19:08] perlmonkey2: If I wanted to have several host names off the same server, would writing a short proxy server in node be a good idea?  Seems like it would be easy, and it would be weird to fire up Apache just for that.
[19:08] mnbvasd: ryah_: from net.js, or starting with a plain text tls socket?

[19:34] perlmonkey2: konobi: I haven't found any libs that do proxying or virtual hosts.  But I did find several people asking the same question and the answer seems to be a node.js proxy on 80 redirecting based on the hostname.  I even found a simple exmple app for doing this.  Do you have any libs you can remember?

[20:03] caolanm: isaacs[away]: thanks for your help, I think I may have to give up for a while, I'd like to actually write some code tonight ;)
[20:03] piscisaureus: ACTION hi
[20:03] caolanm: russ_nyc: parseKeywords etc don't accept a callback
[20:03] caolanm: that probably means they are synchronous
[20:03] hunterloftis: By default, express serves everything as a 200 - do you guys use a caching middleware or something to get the browser to only request new shit?
[20:04] caolanm: russ_nyc: if they are synchronous you don't need to use the async library to do what you are doing
[20:04] hunterloftis: like connect.cache? Just looking for the common solutions
[20:04] russ_nyc: yeah, i assumed that it would run each of those at the same time and when they all returned it would move on?
[20:04] wink_ has joined the channel
[20:04] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: I would not recommend connect.cache
[20:04] caolanm: russ_nyc: it would do that if those functions were capable of running asynchronously
[20:04] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: what would you recommend for caching & gzipping?
[20:04] caolanm: russ_nyc: I'm afraid it won't make them run async
[20:04] konobi: russ_nyc: parsing keywords doesn't sound blocking
[20:05] konobi: sounds like it's on-cpu only
[20:05] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: nothing in connect lol, we ship our stuff off to a CDN after we pipe it through gzip
[20:05] femtoo has joined the channel
[20:05] russ_nyc: im not sure i usnderstand.  parallel wont run  these in parallel if they dont accept a callback?
[20:06] RichardJ has joined the channel
[20:06] russ_nyc: would you happen to have an example of how i should set it up?
[20:06] konobi: russ_nyc: is parsekeywords doing any IO communication via a socket or disk access?
[20:06] russ_nyc: no
[20:06] montylounge has joined the channel
[20:06] konobi: then it's not blocking
[20:06] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: what about just adding expires headers & stuff?
[20:06] pieterv has joined the channel
[20:07] broofa: How does one run node in a mode where you don't have to "make ; make install" every time you edit one of the node/lib/*.js files to get your changes to take affect?
[20:07] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: just add some middleware or do it in the route, depends what you need
[20:07] konobi: you only need a callback when you have something that you block on and when that's finished you do a callback
[20:07] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: I dont think it is logical to use something like connect.cache and apply it to every response
[20:07] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: k, wanted to see if something like that (tested, etc) was already out there before I wrote some expires middleware
[20:08] russ_nyc: so, since parseWhatever isnt blocking, using async.parallel wont speed it up?
[20:08] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: I want to remove .cache haha
[20:08] tjholowaychuk: and a few others
[20:08] mscdex: broofa: there isn't a way at the moment afaik
[20:09] mscdex: broofa: possibly short of copying the libs elsewhere and using an absolute or relative include path
[20:10] mscdex: broofa: and doing a require that way
[20:11] dguttman has joined the channel
[20:13] stephank has joined the channel
[20:14] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: what about connect.gzip?
[20:14] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: I wouldnt personally use it, more costly than anything else
[20:15] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: hmm, what do you use personally for gzipping then?
[20:16] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: we dont use middleware, we have a compiler for jade that we use to grab the css/js etc, minify, aggregate, gzip, and ship off to s3
[20:17] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: gotcha, considering that in the future, but want a temporary / easier solution atm. May do some tests with gzip middleware in C
[20:18] tjholowaychuk: yeah the c one might be ok
[20:18] tjholowaychuk: but with how slow the one is im not sure you really gain anything.. sure it is gzipped but you waste more time compressing than you save in transfer haha
[20:18] tjholowaychuk: i havent benched lately thoguh so hard to say
[20:18] hunterloftis: Yeah I noticed that connect.gzip branches to two
[20:19] mark___ has joined the channel

[21:13] tanepiper: well you will have response.headers

[21:14] djanowski: tanepiper: it's not that i want only the headers. i want to see exactly what i'm getting, because i suspect that the server may be replying with non-standard things
[21:15] tanepiper: oh so you want the non-object response, before it is made a nice object?

[21:28] bingomanatee: so isaacs - the PHP meetup guy is stoked - sure I can't change your mind?
[21:28] ryah_: djanowski: hi
[21:28] ryah_: piscisaureus: hi
[21:28] isaacs: bingomanatee: i'll meet anyone you want.  especially if there's free food and/or beer.  but does it really make sense to give a talk about node or npm or something at a php meetup?
[21:28] bingomanatee: Yea,
[21:29] djanowski: ryah_: hey, sorry to ping you directly. i'm pretty sure i'm confirming my issue. do you know if multiple Set-Cookie headers will be correctly exposed in the ClientResponse?
[21:29] caolanm: isaacs: if you take a look at http://github.com/caolan/kanso there is a directory list there, I want the commonjs and static directories to be included in the install so I can reference them from the command line tool
[21:29] bingomanatee: In fact I want to have a 2 hour hands on and get them behind the wheel of express. 
[21:29] isaacs: i mean, maybe i could give a talk on "Why I Stopped Using PHP and Fell In Love With JavaScript"
[21:29] bingomanatee: Trust me - I'm as obnoxious in the php community as iI am here. brb. -of  too lunch
[21:29] piscisaureus: ryah_: that node performance test that you are doing? what is it and where can I find it?

[21:31] sveimac has joined the channel
[21:31] djanowski: ryah_: oh, interesting. is there any interest in fixing it for 0.2.x?
[21:32] isaacs: caolanm: or just don't have a files list, and everything will get installed.
[21:32] isaacs: caolanm: use relative paths.
[21:32] ryah_: piscisaureus: i don't think it's online
[21:32] isaacs: caolanm: it'll Just Work.
[21:32] ryah_: djanowski: upgrade to 0.3
[21:32] ryah_: djanowski: it would be an API change in 0.2 - so we can't backport that change
[21:32] caolanm: isaacs: hmmm, I'm using relative paths already, and it doesn't seem to work... I'll investigate further
[21:32] Kingdutch: Nightnight
[21:32] ryah_: iirc v0.2 concats set-cookie headers with ', '
[21:33] isaacs: caolanm: if you can define "doesn't work" more precisely, i'd be happy to take a look.

[21:35] djanowski: 0.3 is not on homebrew right?
[21:35] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: In jade, one of my guys' most frequent questions is, how to set properties inline if it's a boolean property like "checked", eg:
[21:35] hunterloftis: input(type="checkbox", value=someVar ? "yes" : "no") works fine, but what about setting "checked" or not based on someVar?
[21:36] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: it's documented. input(type='checkbox', checked)
[21:36] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: it's documented. input(type='checkbox', checked: true)
[21:36] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: it's documented. input(type='checkbox', checked: false)
[21:36] tjholowaychuk: etc
[21:36] ryah_: djanowski: advice: don't use homebrew :)
[21:36] tjholowaychuk: or checked='checked' of course
[21:36] technoweenie has joined the channel
[21:36] djanowski: ryah_: you mean don't use homebrew to install node, or at all?
[21:36] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: ah! Great, thanks. I must have missed that in the docs
[21:36] ryah_: djanowski: at all
[21:36] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: if someVar is truthy then it should work
[21:36] djanowski: ryah_: i'd love to hear more on that :)
[21:37] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: actually it has to be a boolean
[21:37] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: Yep, just saw that it needs to be !!bool
[21:37] ryah_: djanowski: takes too long to explain. but - no one actually uses homebrew.
[21:37] tjholowaychuk: homebrew sucks
[21:38] djanowski: ryah_: well i do and i know a bunch of people who use it too. and from my limited understanding, it works way better than macports. unless you guys have something else to recommend?
[21:38] tjholowaychuk: my recommendation is using nothing
[21:38] tjholowaychuk: lol
[21:38] ryah_: djanowski: install stuff from source

[21:44] djanowski: tjholowaychuk: definitely crappy, yes

[22:00] iFire has joined the channel
[22:00] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: yes, let's replace homebrew.
[22:00] tanepiper: I stand by my earlier statement
[22:00] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: we should combine forces.
[22:00] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: I would love that haha
[22:00] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: use node in place of ruby.  make it not crappy.
[22:00] tjholowaychuk: time is not my friend, but it would be awesome
[22:00] isaacs: same here
[22:01] isaacs: and i really need to finish a few things with npm before taking on the next package management hurdle.
[22:01] SubStack: don't combine forces you'll kill us all!
[22:01] isaacs: but like, all this shit with locating openssl, and compiling modules that don't have the right headers and stuff.  gah.  it's awful.
[22:01] SubStack: plus I'll have to redraw the contributors
[22:01] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: yeah all that jazz is pretty painful sometimes
[22:01] isaacs: how hard can that really be? i mean, it's just bytes on the disk, files in folders.  figure it out, you know?
[22:01] isaacs: you can tell gcc and ld where to find stuff.
[22:01] desaiu has joined the channel
[22:01] isaacs: it can't be that difficult.
[22:01] bradleymeck: isaacs does npm support having multiple repositories (multiverse/universe stuff?)
[22:02] TomsB: Inline flash socket policy file serving just does not work.
[22:02] isaacs: bradleymeck: you can have one registry per command.  but you can spin up your own registry pretty easily
[22:02] klaytonix has joined the channel
[22:02] isaacs: bradleymeck: multi-reg is harder than it seems.
[22:02] isaacs: especially since npm is a publishing agent as well as a read-client
[22:02] bradleymeck: i have no doubt
[22:02] isaacs: it'd mean un-DRYing a lot of code to pull that apart.

[22:03] bmavity has joined the channel
[22:03] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: also, i think the package.json model is totally something that could be extended easily
[22:04] TooTallNate: TomB: Are you sure that you're receiving the request properly? Put a `console.log` inside the 'if' statement, to make sure...
[22:04] pquerna: cloud analytics eh
[22:04] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: like, in 2012, i want to do this.  maybe before.
[22:04] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: yeah that would be cool. my quick and dirty proof-of-concept is using similar
[22:04] stepheneb_ has joined the channel
[22:04] tjholowaychuk: but obviously right now I have to have them in the repo
[22:05] tjholowaychuk: instead of distributed
[22:05] isaacs: right
[22:05] TomsB: bradleymeck I tried everything.. XML is serverd but client seems to ignore it.
[22:05] isaacs: no, you need a registry
[22:05] micheil has joined the channel
[22:05] isaacs: so, here's the social problem that homebrew and aptitude have (and, to a lesser extent, kiwi as well): you can't have a single cabal of people managing the repo.  you need the community to have unfettered access for authors to put stuff into it.
[22:05] isaacs: and manage it , and bump versions, etc.
[22:06] isaacs: if you take that as a given, of course, it raises a bunch of problems (which npm has)
[22:06] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: yeah i agree, just saying they need to be supplied for the first while by users other than the devs themselves
[22:06] tjholowaychuk: since most wont care at all
[22:06] tjholowaychuk: haha
[22:06] isaacs: permissions/trust issues, most importantly
[22:06] TomsB: bradleymeck, I can show you sample code. It's small.
[22:06] isaacs: sure, exactly
[22:06] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: that's why i've written so many package.json files for so many node programs :)
[22:07] tjholowaychuk: haha ya there you go

[22:07] TomsB: TooTallNate, Yes I'm sure.
[22:07] tjholowaychuk: these are all in-repo right now
[22:07] tjholowaychuk: because im lazy
[22:07] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: neat.
[22:07] warz: hrm. async.js looks pretty useful.
[22:07] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: i wanna see `npm install openssl` and `npm install vim`
[22:07] warz: i should try it out.
[22:07] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: that would be nice
[22:07] bmavity: is anyone working on a bundler type thing for node? or is there a way to do it that i am missing?
[22:08] bradleymeck: i want to see npm install node@0.3.5, sigh a man can dream
[22:08] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: and {"name":"node", "dependencies":{"v8":"some-version", "openssl":"etc ...
[22:08] isaacs: bradleymeck: you can do npm install nave, and then nave use 0.3.5
[22:08] bradleymeck: bmavity, its been in discussion, there are some issues though
[22:08] isaacs: bradleymeck: or s/ave//
[22:08] isaacs: or s/ave/vm/
[22:08] mscdex: tjholowaychuk: what's that gist for?
[22:09] bradleymeck: yea, but I was thinking more dumping an npm down w/o node even being installed before hand i guess, hehe
[22:09] bmavity: bradleymeck: ok thanks :)
[22:09] tjholowaychuk: mscdex: started kiwi as a general system PM
[22:09] mscdex: ah
[22:09] TooTallNate: TomB: Hard to say then without seeing your code. Possible the XML isn't proper? Possible the socket connection isn't being closed after?
[22:09] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: oh, kiwi lives again?
[22:09] tjholowaychuk: haha yup
[22:09] TomsB: I'll show ya
[22:09] tjholowaychuk: I havent pushed anything
[22:09] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: http://screenr.com/5Oq (boring, haha was just showing someone)
[22:10] tanepiper: isaacs: agreed, one thing i notice from @nodemodules is people mess up their package.json files all the time
[22:10] isaacs: tanepiper: right, which is why npm does a *lot* of data correction/validation
[22:10] tanepiper: usually they put the wrong url in 
[22:10] isaacs: but i mean, these are the problems of distributed authorship, right?  there are huge benefits, as well.
[22:10] isaacs: look at how easy it is to get a program published and into use with npm.
[22:11] isaacs: and *i* don't have to do anything.
[22:11] isaacs: if i go on vacation, or get hit by a truck, or win the lotto, npm lives on
[22:11] tjholowaychuk: haha or win the lotto
[22:11] tjholowaychuk: truth
[22:11] bradleymeck: sweet heavens no birt this time
[22:11] tanepiper: yup, but if I can download, correct, version bump and upload again that could be handy - but i can see it being abused as well
[22:11] isaacs: tanepiper: sure.  i do that sometimes.

[22:12] TomsB: From line 22.

[22:14] tanepiper: maybe something like this: npm blame - then it allows me to blame an author about an error in their package, and next time they interact with npm they get a message?
[22:14] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: wow, kiwi's code is *old*.  archeological stuff
[22:14] isaacs: tanepiper: that's a cool idea.
[22:14] isaacs: tanepiper: or you could just email them.
[22:14] TomsB: console says: writeing policy file but client just does nothing.
[22:15] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: in the repo?
[22:15] TooTallNate: TomB: I think your XML is too much, try this: "var xml = '<cross-domain-policy><allow-access-from domain="*" to-ports="*"/></cross-domain-policy>'"
[22:15] tanepiper: isaacs: there is that as well :)
[22:15] isaacs: tanepiper: `npm author ls <pkg>` gives you their info
[22:15] tjholowaychuk: yeah a good year or so now maybe
[22:15] TomsB: If i run policy server on port 843 then it's fine. Clinet working as expected.
[22:15] TooTallNate: TomB: I think it might be the newlines
[22:15] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: that's like, skeletons and fossils and mummys and stuff, in node-years
[22:15] tjholowaychuk: hahaha
[22:15] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: 2009 was like neolithic era
[22:15] bradleymeck: lol npm email npm "feature request? your package manager cant email people via cli"
[22:15] mscdex: TomsB: I have the same XML except no newlines and i have adobe.com instead of macromedia.com for the dtd url

[22:16] mscdex: TomsB: and i know that works with flash
[22:16] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: parsing yaml with bash is still one of the weirdest things ive done hhaha
[22:16] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: i don't know you that well.  but yeah, if you've done anything weirder, you probably shouldn't talk abotu it in public.

[22:25] drtyhbo: is there a way to see what command has executed after a call to spawn()?
[22:26] bradleymeck: drtyhbo can you clarify?
[22:28] rjrodger has joined the channel
[22:28] drtyhbo: bradleymeck: totally! I'm using spawn to launch a mysql process, passing in the -u and -p command line arguments through the args=[] parameter.
[22:28] drtyhbo: however mysql is acting like it's not receiving the parameters or it's receiving incorrect parameters
[22:29] piscisaureus: ryah_: does sendmsg work with unix sockets only?
[22:29] drtyhbo: so i've been looking for a way to see what is actually being passed in to help debug the issue
[22:29] konobi: there's an in production PS3 game that uses node as it's server backend... kinda awesome

[22:30] tjholowaychuk: konobi: flower is already out
[22:30] ryah_: piscisaureus: yes
[22:30] mscdex: drtyhbo: if you're specifying the username and password on the commandline in one go you need to use --username=foo --password=foo
[22:30] ryah_: piscisaureus: well - it's only used with unix sockets in node
[22:30] mscdex: drtyhbo: i think -p always prompts for a password
[22:31] konobi: yes... in production... as in, it's already running in a production environment
[22:31] konobi: (stupid IT vs gaming terminology)
[22:31] tjholowaychuk: oh
[22:31] tjholowaychuk: i see
[22:31] piscisaureus: ryah_: ok. so no we need win support then. as long as we can't do named pipes on windows, that is
[22:32] drtyhbo: ahh that makes sense
[22:32] drtyhbo: rather than using -u -p
[22:32] drtyhbo: awesome, thanks for your help!
[22:32] mscdex: no problem
[22:32] masahiroh has joined the channel
[22:32] ryah_: piscisaureus: yeah - when people request unix sockets you should give them tcp ones
[22:32] ryah_: piscisaureus: well - maybe that's not good...
[22:32] piscisaureus: ryah_: currently I'm just telling them to piss off
[22:32] mscdex: drtyhbo: are you executing sql using the mysql commandline tool?
[22:33] ryah_: piscisaureus: i guess that's okay for nwo
[22:33] riven` has joined the channel
[22:33] ryah_: piscisaureus: it might be good to open a TCP server on some random port and write the port into the specified file
[22:33] unomi has joined the channel
[22:33] ryah_: or something...
[22:33] unomi has joined the channel
[22:33] ryah_: then the person connecting to the "unix" socket would read the port 
[22:34] drtyhbo: mscdex: not at the moment. i'm adding a command that will drop the user into mysql with her username/password.
[22:34] piscisaureus: ryah_: could be a good temporary solution. but I want stuff to work just as on linux, not create some sort of crazy emulation layer :-/
[22:34] mscdex: drtyhbo: ah ok, well if you ever go down that road: https://github.com/mscdex/node-poormansmysql :p
[22:35] ryah_: piscisaureus: i agree - crazy emulation layers are not good
[22:35] drtyhbo: mscdex: lol, that's an awesome name
[22:35] ryah_: but that doesnt sound totally bad
[22:35] piscisaureus: ryah_: id rather use named pipes for it on windows for that, these behave just like unix sockets
[22:35] mscdex: drtyhbo: just know that came out well before node-mysql heh ;-)
[22:35] ryah_: piscisaureus: oh, you have named pipes?
[22:35] piscisaureus: ryah_: yeah
[22:36] ryah_: they are located in the file system?
[22:36] piscisaureus: ryah_: kinda
[22:36] drtyhbo: this is cool, thanks for the share
[22:36] piscisaureus: in paths like \\?\pipe\name
[22:36] mscdex: that was my first node module, so it could probably use some work
[22:37] ryah_: piscisaureus: we should probably have some x-platform tmp dir

[22:38] piscisaureus: ryah_: or use the winapi GetTemporaryFileName or something like that
[22:38] ryah_: piscisaureus: oh we definitely need that
[22:39] piscisaureus: ryah_: as for pipes, they could be used when I aio in node_net.cc
[22:39] piscisaureus: but I'm afraid that requires some serious refactoring which I am afraid of
[22:39] ryah_: aio?
[22:40] ryah_: iocp?
[22:40] piscisaureus: yeah
[22:40] Dreamer3 has joined the channel
[22:40] ryah_: yeah. im pretty good with net refactors (having done it like 10 times) so maybe we should just mock out the interface
[22:40] ryah_: and i'll try to do it
[22:41] ryah_: but i've got other stuff to finish before i can do that - it'd be like a week-long project
[22:41] piscisaureus: ryah_: I don't really care about the interface. I think you have a strong opinion on that :-)
[22:41] ryah_: well internal socket interface
[22:42] piscisaureus: ryah_: but the bottom line is that instead of reporting "hey, write can't be done now" back to JS it should be "hey, write didn't complete yet, will get back to you when it's done"
[22:42] nejucomo has joined the channel
[22:42] piscisaureus: like node_file works
[22:42] ryah_: basically i think we should make an ObjectWrap c++ socket
[22:43] ryah_: and trash most of the js in net.js
[22:43] ryah_: then just wrap it up to make it pretty
[22:43] piscisaureus: ryah_: sounds like a good idea
[22:44] piscisaureus: ryah_: the pro would be that then I could drop libev on windows and build a very lightweight shim that doesn't support the IO watcher
[22:44] BrianTheCoder has joined the channel
[22:44] piscisaureus: as windows does almost anything that libev and libeio does natively already
[22:44] ryah_: i guess - not sure how c-ares is going to work without libev
[22:44] brianleroux has joined the channel
[22:44] piscisaureus: is c-ares tied to libev?
[22:44] piscisaureus: c-ares was the only thing that worked out of the box :-)
[22:44] ryah_: well, it's currently integrated into the node event loop with an ev_io
[22:45] ryah_: presumably you can integrate it into your event loop too...
[22:45] piscisaureus: ACTION looking into that
[22:45] ryah_: i also wouldn't be against trashing c-ares and using the system resolver

[22:47] ryah_: piscisaureus: i'd use libeio to do it async
[22:47] JimBastard has joined the channel
[22:47] ryah_: unix systems generally don't have async dns
[22:47] piscisaureus: ryah_: yeah
[22:47] piscisaureus: ryah_: I want libeio gone too, on windows
[22:47] piscisaureus: ryah_: everything it does can be done with QueueUserWorkItem() on windows
[22:48] ryah_: well - i'd rather have one interface
[22:48] ryah_: so many we can put libeio behind a windows-like api
[22:48] ryah_: or the other way around
[22:49] piscisaureus: ryah_: sure. the other way around would work as well I guess :-)
[22:49] piscisaureus: ryah_: I need some decent shimming anyway because I need to work areound the 512 fd limit
[22:49] ryah_: :)
[22:50] piscisaureus: ryah_: so if you feel like implementing libc one day, or a 4-heap, be my guest :-)
[22:50] bradleymeck: ACTION ponders how you would get around the filename limit on windows
[22:50] piscisaureus: filename limit?
[22:50] danyork: ryah_: Thanks for commenting on my article about Node and IPv6... that's a *doh!* kind of thing!  
[22:51] piscisaureus: it is not the issue
[22:51] piscisaureus: fd limit it is

[22:54] piscisaureus: ryah_: btw, does posix have the concept of APCs?

[22:54] piscisaureus: asynchronous procedure call? Like queuing a callback to a thread?
[22:56] ryah_: no, not that i know of
[22:57] ryah_: but mac has something called "grand central station" or something - which is a worker queue
[22:57] piscisaureus: ryah_: ok. I was thinking of reimplementing libev around that
[22:57] ryah_: it'd be nice to take advantage of that
[22:57] bradleymeck: piscisaureus, you can only have a filename of a certain size on windows, its a bug I had to fix in our ASP app today, past 246 character filename some stuff goes bonkers in the win32 api
[22:58] piscisaureus: bradleymeck: the win32 api is not the issue, it supports 32K filenames unless you're using windows 95...
