[06:25] samcday: tmzt_, Yeah, a FCGI/CGI response is simply just a whole HTTP response sans the HTTP/1.1 header line
[06:25] samcday: But that's just sent out verbatim
[06:25] samcday: I dunno about putting some of that stuff in process.env though
[06:25] samcday: Don't forget that you can have multiple requests happening in one instant
[06:26] met_ has joined the channel
[06:26] tmzt_: true
[06:26] tmzt_: so process.env wouldn't work, req.fastcgi.records would be better
[06:26] tmzt_: or whatever you want to call it
[06:29] samcday: Yeah that sounds like a great idea actually
[06:29] samcday: Then again, writing stuff specifically for fastcgi is kinda pointless
[06:30] tmzt_: okay, but there aren't really any cgi implmentations for node either
[06:30] tmzt_: so there isn't a precedent for that stuff passed as env vars
[06:30] samcday: I kinda envision this fcgi proxy as being completely transparent. Other than changing the app.listen() line, nothing else should change to make your server "just work" inside an FCGI process manager
[06:30] tmzt_: though if uri going ot be parsed later you don't need request_uri or script_name
[06:30] tmzt_: right
[06:30] samcday: Yeah exactly
[06:31] samcday: And don't really need that middleware I was talking about anyway
[06:31] tmzt_: although script name is useful for figuring out what script your running as, like $0
[06:31] tmzt_: but not really in node
[06:31] zakabird has joined the channel
[06:31] samcday: Since if your server has mod_fcgid, it's guaranteed to have mod_rewrite
[06:31] tmzt_: what middleware?
[06:31] samcday: The one I thought might be cool, that uses pathinfo to generate request.url;
[06:32] tmzt_: ah
[06:32] tmzt_: well, now I get to suffer the pain of wsdl in node
[06:33] samcday: Oh jesus :p
[06:33] tmzt_: on there theory that writing a proxy in node will be faster than making magento work with rest in the php
[06:33] tmzt_: and using rewrite to ensure that requests go to the right place

[06:57] marlun: In https://gist.github.com/891911 I feel that I'm starting to get deep into callback nesting now (after the compiled line I want to write it back to a file which will ad even more depth) but if I change the anonymous functions to function pointers I loose access to the variables files, compiled and name. How should I solve this? 
[06:59] SubStack: marlun: named functions or flow control libs are useful for that sort of problem
[07:00] beawesomeinstead has joined the channel
[07:00] mhooker: marlun: are you using hard tabs? if you are, you might find it easier to read the code with soft tabs of 2-4 spaces
[07:01] SubStack: marlun: lots to choose from! https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Modules#async-flow
[07:01] SubStack: you might try starting with step

[07:01] mhooker: for example, https://gist.github.com/891920

[07:09] marlun: SubStack: With named functions you mean just adding names which will make it easier to debug or do you mean moving the function away from the current code into it's own function below?

[07:12] SubStack: in your case it seems like a flow control lib would be more useful however

[10:53] EmmaCroix: but still i get nodejs 0.3.8 when i type node in console
[10:53] EmmaCroix: I'm using ubuntu 10.10. What am I doing wrong?
[10:56] shaunau: Emma, i dont use linux anymore, but i would have thought it would be apt-get update nodejs
[10:57] EmmaCroix: i think there is a problem with two versions of nodejs running beside eachother
[10:58] shaunau: peronally, i just always start fresh and install locally ~/local using a script that pulls from nodejs.org i think the script was on npm.prg
[10:58] mzx has joined the channel
[10:58] shaunau: oh, you're installing it seperatly - not upgrading.
[10:58] EmmaCroix: ok
[10:58] shaunau: maybe it's just your path that needs to chnage
[10:59] stagas: yay javascript world of soccer https://github.com/stagas/jwos
[10:59] EmmaCroix: yeah i think that will solve it, how to change the path?
[10:59] shaunau: which node
[10:59] nivoc has joined the channel
[10:59] shaunau: if you type that command it will tell you where node is in your path
[10:59] EmmaCroix: great! thnx :)
[11:00] EmmaCroix: "/home/ubuntu/local/node/bin/node "
[11:00] shaunau: then, you need to change your path, possibly the file ~/.bashrc (if your're using bash)
[11:00] EmmaCroix: Win!
[11:00] EmmaCroix: :D
[11:00] shaunau: ok so thats where its running the node binary
[11:00] EmmaCroix: That was the thing I forgot
[11:00] okuryu has joined the channel
[11:01] EmmaCroix: Now I remember that i setup that bashrc thing way back during 0.3.8, I'll change it to the correct path

[11:03] shaunau: cool
[11:03] EmmaCroix: yeah
[11:03] shaunau: i think there is something to actually manage that for you..

[11:18] EmmaCroix: jetienne: same respone, nodejs is already the newest version.

[12:36] Sembiance: vilhonen_: the PHP scripts were very simple before, they basically just responded to AJAX requests and either saved or retrieved data from postgres. Very little actual back end logic. So converting to node.js was very simple, didn't have to change much of the front end at all, just re-implemented each ajax end point in node.js instead
[12:36] piscisaureus: mraleph: what I need is a way to iterate over SIMPLE_OPTIONS in guaranteed order
[12:36] Sembiance: vilhonen_: also converted the postgres tables into redis objects (as it made sense, the data model changed a bit of course)
[12:36] piscisaureus: mraleph: but I couldn't find out how to do that on python or if it was even supported
[12:36] kal-EL_ has joined the channel
[12:37] mraleph: piscisaureus: if you split it into two parts and iterate first part first then you'll get guaranteed order :-))
[12:37] piscisaureus: mraleph: yes but we need to split in three parts then
[12:37] mraleph: piscisaureus: why?
[12:39] Sembiance: About a week ago I updated from node v0.2.5 to v0.4.3  I was a bit worried about making such a huge jump, but things have turned out just great, no problems at all :)

[12:40] piscisaureus: mraleph: heh. oh no, I'm thinking about an earlier version where toolchain dependend on OS, but that is no more
[12:40] piscisaureus: mraleph: so, ok, I'll split it in two parts
[12:41] piscisaureus: mraleph: you happen to know how isolates breaks cygwin? is that something trivial?

[12:56] piscisaureus: no-gooder: there are maybe a few that are not php-specific (strnatcmp, htmlentities, md5). Yes, you can use the php.js implementation if you need a quick fix. But be careful, I've seen examples where the php.js implementation was actually wrong. And often the php.js implementation relies on _other_ php.js function so you end up copying a lot of them.

[14:21] kuya: micheil: that prints undefined

[14:22] micheil: ralphholzmann: there's no such thing as toString('binary')

[14:22] mikegerwitz: ralphholzmann: You can simply write the buffer to the stream. Make sure you specify binary encoding when writing. e.g. write( buffer, 'binary' )
[14:22] kuya: bradleymeck: is there any way around it?
[14:23] ralphholzmann: mikegerwitz: thanks, I'll give it a try

[14:39] aho: (shorty)
[14:39] XakBooT: but i want to node understand that http packets come with different hostname and i want to node understand and handle and answer it
[14:39] ralphholzmann: mikegerwitz: haha, sorry, just been working on this for quite a long time and its been a blocker for, well, basically the entire app
[14:39] piscisaureus: jonaslund: well erm, no very concrete results. Ryan and I are refactoring parts of the event loop to support iocp on windows

[14:40] XakBooT: bradleymeck: but i want to node understand that http packets come with different hostname and i want to node understand and handle and answer it
[14:40] bradleymeck: xakboot, just check the host header
[14:40] jonaslund: piscisaureus: ah cool

[14:40] aho: *everything* is drawn via opengl
[14:40] mikegerwitz: ralphholzmann: haha, nah you woke me up :)
[14:40] XakBooT: bradleymeck: it is like ports.conf in apache or what ??
[14:40] aho: 2d canvas included
[14:40] aho: it's bloody fast
[14:40] mwdev: It is looking like that worked guys!  Thanks for pointing me to it.
[14:40] MrTopf has joined the channel
[14:40] sirkitree has joined the channel
[14:40] piscisaureus: jonaslund: but we're still working on that. But since two weeks I get paid by cloudkick/rackspace so that might help to speed things up
[14:41] XakBooT: bradleymeck, are you pro programmer on node.js
[14:41] bradleymeck: xakboot not exactly, it is a header sent by clients saying the hostname they want to connect to
[14:41] bradleymeck: perhaps, but i tend to stay busy
[14:41] jonaslund: piscisaureus: that's awesome!
[14:41] XakBooT: bradleymeck, yes i understand it and i want to make node recognize it
[14:41] ralphholzmann: mikegerwitz: in case you're interested, it seems that both the buffer and the request needed to be written in binary. e.g. while building the "post body" I needed to do buffer.toString('binary') as well as request.write(postBody, 'binary')
[14:42] XakBooT: bradleymeck, what extension do i need
[14:42] mwdev: has anyone here deployed node to an ec2 instance?
[14:42] markc_ has joined the channel
[14:42] bradleymeck: it will be included in requests, ie. function(req,res) {req.headers.host//this is the value you want}
[14:42] pdelgallego has joined the channel
[14:42] jonaslund: piscisaureus: i think i'm gonna try to take a stab at learning git properly since my msvc work is prolly really outdated by now so i need to try to rescue as much work as possible :)
[14:43] paulrobinson has joined the channel
[14:43] paulrobinson has left the channel
[14:43] ralphholzmann: although, now im worried about the fact that 'binary' is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of node :/
[14:43] piscisaureus: jonaslund: awesome! I still want this msvc stuff (finally got my MSDN ultimate subscription, yay) but atm I cannot really wrap my head about so much projects at once. So I'm going to finish iocp first before working on msvc.
[14:43] jonaslund: piscisaureus: so is mingw on par with cygwin now ?
[14:44] piscisaureus: not really
[14:44] piscisaureus: well it depends
[14:44] jonaslund: i mean FUNCTIONALLY.. not in regards to performance
[14:44] bradleymeck: do you have a donation point for your mingw work?
[14:44] jonaslund: bradleymeck: well rackspace pays him so well :D
[14:45] dyer has joined the channel
[14:45] piscisaureus: jonaslund: well most stuff works but cygwin nicely overloads signals, kill, ansi coloring, symlinks etc and we didn;t really finish that yet
[14:45] jonaslund: piscisaureus: or do we have unix:isms and win:isms mucking up mingw functionally compared to cygwin ?
[14:46] jonaslund: hmmm.. feels like details or like things that are trouble enough on windows as:is
[14:46] piscisaureus: jonaslund: yes, that's true
[14:46] jonaslund: hmmm
[14:46] jonaslund: does multi-node work with cygwin and/or mingw ?
[14:47] jonaslund: (do you binarify the pipes?)
[14:47] piscisaureus: jonaslund: quite some stuff is also fairly easy to implement but just isn't so far
[14:47] piscisaureus: yes pipes are binarified
[14:47] jonaslund: nice
[14:47] piscisaureus: they're sockets atm actually, will be named pipes
[14:47] piscisaureus: in the future
[14:47] dguttman has joined the channel
[14:47] jonaslund: not std pipes ?
[14:48] jonaslund: or maybe they're not std pipes on *nix either ?
[14:48] piscisaureus: jonaslund: I think on *nix they're ususally domain sockets
[14:48] jonaslund: oh ok
[14:49] gozala has joined the channel
[14:49] ralphholzmann: Does anyone know why Buffer.toString('binary') is being deprecated?
[14:49] piscisaureus: jonaslund: should not matter, the only thing that matters is that whatever you stuff in there comes out unaltered at the other end :-)
[14:49] mscdex: ralphholzmann: because most core functions can deal with Buffers directly now
[14:49] jonaslund: ralphholzmann: the point is that you can write the bytes manually to a buffer ie: aBuffer[0]=byteOne
[14:50] ralphholzmann: gotcha. So what if I app depends on that functionality
[14:50] ralphholzmann: am I stuck on v0.4 ?
[14:50] piscisaureus: bradleymeck: I have no donation point, and money is not really an issue atm. But if you can donate me some time that'd be awesome, I feel 168 hours a week is quite tight
[14:50] ralphholzmann: or is there a way I'll be able to get data in that format in the future?

[14:52] jonaslund: bradleymeck: last i worked on it was around the release of 4.0 , been busy with other stuff since then
[14:53] jonaslund: so i need to track alot of changes
[14:53] jonaslund: i should begin with some separate commits with regards to small compiling fixes
[14:53] jonaslund: because i have a faint memory of me doing something like 30 small changes in c++ files just to get msvc compilation
[14:54] jonaslund: what git clients do you guys use btw ?

[16:15] micheil: RushPL: simply because things like websockets generally work best in an asynchronous style environment, also, to scale them you can hit issues, better to let others solve them for you.
[16:15] ilya: bradleymeck: I'd prefer to use node's defaul libs, though. And thanks, I'll check out RFC.

[16:57] tjholowaychuk: its not a proxy

[16:59] pquerna: tjholowaychuk: oh?
[17:00] tjholowaychuk: pquerna: but the problem is that node keeps emitting "data" events

[17:02] tjholowaychuk: pquerna: looks fine, or is it not working?
[17:02] pquerna: tjholowaychuk: the only other option i could think of, is to buffer it to disk, and don't call next() until you know its smaller than your limit
[17:03] pquerna: tjholowaychuk: well, it calls next() before parsing the body, so whatever else is running will keep running

[17:04] pquerna: well, a pause that worked
[17:04] tjholowaychuk: I have a utility in connect
[17:04] tjholowaychuk: it works fine, I should probably be actually pause()ing in there too though
[17:04] tjholowaychuk: as well as the memory buffer
[17:05] tjholowaychuk: I'm using that for session() and a few others I think
[17:05] tjholowaychuk: might just be session

[19:05] tiemonster: wink_: theoretically
[19:05] bingomanatee: there you go. thanks wink_
[19:05] tjholowaychuk: chrisdickinson: would be tough then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[19:05] tjholowaychuk: woah
[19:05] tjholowaychuk: haha
[19:05] bingomanatee: you can always pre-film the demo of the actual game and show the admin layer on skype.

[19:06] tiemonster: Booths: never seen that. weird as heck.
[19:06] tschundeee: tjholowaychuk: I am coming from rails... and I want to build a site similar to stackoverflow for an instead of an internal wiki... could you recommend nodejs for this purpose?
[19:06] tjholowaychuk: chrisdickinson: currently it's not setup to be async, and doing so would slow express down a bit since we would need to complicate the logic massively to allow for async views
[19:06] tschundeee: tjholowaychuk: plus express of course...
[19:06] bingomanatee: tschundee: I have an MVC "Starter kit" using mongoose on git. 
[19:06] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: that was what I thought :P it's actually called "plate": (http://github.com/chrisdickinson/plate), and it's designed so that you can pass callback functions into the context and have them evaluate inside the template render cycle
[19:06] tiemonster: bingomanatee: we would prefilm no matter what. you don't want it to go down during a presentation like that. ;-)
[19:06] tjholowaychuk: chrisdickinson: the argument is in this issue https://github.com/visionmedia/express/issues#issue/512
[19:07] bingomanatee: its essentially a fork of the express demo with a form and model suite added 
[19:07] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: cool, I'll follow that topic :) thanks
[19:07] V1 has left the channel
[19:07] tschundeee: bingomanatee: that sounds interesting... you have the link?
[19:07] tjholowaychuk: chrisdickinson: yeah, we do that with mongoose queries, but we just override render()
[19:07] Booths: tiemonster: It's weird because some go through fine and the others don't. On the receiving end all it does is res.writeHead(200);res.end();console.log(req.url);
[19:07] swaj: anyone having issues building node 0.4.4?  I've got a strange compilation error on my Debian 6.0 system
[19:08] tjholowaychuk: tschundeee: it really depends
[19:08] tjholowaychuk: on if you want to spend the time
[19:08] tjholowaychuk: for something like that you might be better off with rails/drupal
[19:08] Booths: tiemonster: I'm lead to believe it's the sending side because when I send from another server bypassing the front end they get thruogh and the packet is much longer.
[19:08] tjholowaychuk: if you are not familiar with node at all
[19:09] perlmonkey2 has joined the channel
[19:09] tschundeee: tjholowaychuk: I read the both apis (node.js and express.js) and I played around a bit
[19:09] tjholowaychuk: tschundeee: personally I would use node for just about anything these days, because I enjoy it more, but time-wise for a intranet project you might be better off with something else
[19:09] Bonuspunkt: swaj gcc version?
[19:09] Booths: tiemonster: also, as promised, this is totally me: http://webmarketingxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Web-Feb-hot-chick.jpg
[19:09] bingomanatee: https://github.com/bingomanatee/MVC
[19:09] chrisdickinson: what I'd really like to get towards is an event emitting template language (versus a callback one), so you could just do: "render = template.render(context); render.on('data', resp.write.bind(resp)); render.on('end', resp.end.bind(resp));"
[19:09] swaj: Bonuspunkt: gcc version 4.4.5 (Debian 4.4.5-8)
[19:10] bingomanatee: tschundee: its stil pretty rough - and its MongoDB based so you need to toss that in to use it - but I've been developing a private label game on the back of MVC and its been pretty reliable.
[19:10] tjholowaychuk: chrisdickinson: yeah it will surely evolve in the future
[19:10] tjholowaychuk: it will take some time though

[19:10] tschundeee: bingomanatee: thx mate
[19:10] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: cool. I'll probably be adding that to a branch of plate, soon -- once the itch gets bad enough.
[19:10] tjholowaychuk: chrisdickinson: it would be cool to do event based stuff, and support rendering the same templates via the SS / socket.io
[19:10] bingomanatee: Let me know if you run into any issues/questions. 
[19:11] rfay has joined the channel
[19:11] vckt has joined the channel
[19:11] tschundeee: bingomanatee: thx :) I already installed mongodb and mongoose and I was about to start something like this :)
[19:11] tiemonster: tjholowaychuk: it's high time for a high-level framework for node.js
[19:12] tjholowaychuk: chrisdickinson: my issue with the async stuff in views, is that I dont want views to become a form of flow control
[19:12] tjholowaychuk: tiemonster: haha yeah
[19:12] tjholowaychuk: issue is you can't really solve everyones problems with a high level framework
[19:12] tschundeee: http://geddyjs.org/ looked promising
[19:12] tjholowaychuk: IMO they render themselves relatively useless
[19:12] bingomanatee: Yeah - its kind of the natural "Next step thing" - not as sexy as mobile but it needs to get done. 
[19:12] tschundeee: but somehow these guys stopped developing
[19:12] tiemonster: tjholowaychuk: I'm totally willing to contribute, as long I can find a superstar willing to collaborate
[19:13] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: understandable. I'm mostly of the mind that for view logic, the asynchronous bits either have to move up or down a layer -- either up into middleware, or down into the template language
[19:13] tiemonster: you don't have to solve every use case, just the common ones
[19:13] tiemonster: Django strikes a good balance there
[19:13] Bonuspunkt: swaj link to error messages and hope mscdex sees it :) he helped some guys the last few days ^^
[19:13] chrisdickinson: I like moving them into the template language, personally, since that's (usually) where the data is going to be needed
[19:13] bingomanatee: Plan "B" is to use Backbone and develop around that. It has a bigger user base. 
[19:13] tiemonster: provides lots of batteries included, and an awesome plugin architecture
[19:13] chrisdickinson: tiemonster: (+1 on django)
[19:13] bingomanatee: But I do very much like express and mongoose and so thats where I'm going. 
[19:14] tschundeee: bingomanatee: I also read the backbone.js api
[19:14] swaj: my build errors are here: http://www.pastie.org/1732179
[19:14] tbranyen: having used django on two large projects i can say without hesitation, never again
[19:14] tjholowaychuk: haha
[19:14] tiemonster: the raw materials are all there
[19:14] tjholowaychuk: ya i didnt like django at all
[19:14] Gigawattz has joined the channel
[19:14] tschundeee: backbone seems to be interesting and it should be somehow married with express.js
[19:14] chrisdickinson: django's very opinionated on where things go, and until you put things where django wants them, it'll be a pain.
[19:14] Gigawattz: is ncb000gt about ?
[19:14] tiemonster: chrisdickinson: how so?
[19:14] bingomanatee: I do like Backbone but I also like the idea of tying all the leading independant projects like mongoose, express, socket et all into a larger suite for developers. 
[19:15] insin: models.py and templatetags/, isn't that it?
[19:15] davidascher has joined the channel
[19:15] chrisdickinson: tiemonster: it starts to be second nature in decision making in django: "I want something available to all my templates" -> "ContextProcessor", I want something to happen on all of my views, "Middleware", etc
[19:15] tiemonster: right - saves a lot of time
[19:16] chrisdickinson: definitely. but until you grok how those bits work, it can be painful to get things done
[19:16] chrisdickinson: the big win of django is that they've got great documentation.
[19:16] tschundeee: anyone knows what happened to the geddy.js guys? were they killed or did they just suddenly loose interest??
[19:16] tiemonster: the jargon isn't that different from most other full-feature frameworks
[19:16] tbranyen: chrisdickinson: i especially like how if you want to use email addresses as usernames in django it becomes a nightmare from hell... want to subclass User good luck!
[19:16] bingomanatee: I mean - really, Rails "Solved" MVC, bluntly speaking. 
[19:17] F1LT3R has joined the channel
[19:17] chrisdickinson: tbranyen: yeah, the contrib.auth set of models can be a pain.
[19:17] bingomanatee: But node is about scaling and a more open architecture. 
[19:17] tiemonster: Rails is very rigid, IMHO
[19:17] tbranyen: bingomanatee: bingo
[19:17] chrisdickinson: of course, you could also solve it by adding an auth backend that checks email instead of username.
[19:17] tbranyen: I like options
[19:17] javaanse_jongens has joined the channel
[19:17] tiemonster: if it's too open, though, it turns into PHP
[19:17] tbranyen: chrisdickinson: thats like 1% of the problem
[19:17] tiemonster: that ecosystem is a nightmare
[19:17] tbranyen: auth backend is a piece of cake
[19:18] tbranyen: but username is a primary key
[19:18] tjholowaychuk: I like that node is just a pick your parts and go kinda env
[19:18] tbranyen: so something needs to be stored there
[19:18] tbranyen: and its limited to like 16 characters
[19:18] bingomanatee: Thats kind of the point. I mean - who picks up a framework named "Rails" and then complains about how rigid it is? They warn you in the name! 
[19:18] tjholowaychuk: haha
[19:18] tiemonster: tjholowaychuk: but that makes it hard to build non-trivial applications
[19:18] bingomanatee: When you think of a system that gives you flexibility does a locomotive on iron tracks come to mind?
[19:18] swaj: Rails' rigidity is part of why it's so good.  Convention is a good thing.
[19:18] tjholowaychuk: tiemonster: no way
[19:18] tbranyen: tiemonster: it does? shouldn't that be the opposite?
[19:19] vckt has joined the channel
[19:19] tjholowaychuk: it makes it harder to write trivial things
[19:19] tjholowaychuk: but that is what drupal is for
[19:19] chrisdickinson: tbranyen: yeah -- I think it's 40 or so; just have the backend shove a hash of the email into the username. but yeah, generally I agree -- contrib.auth is kind of a pain in the ass
[19:19] tiemonster: drupal isn't for anything
[19:19] bingomanatee: Sure. However convention doesn't have to be exclusive. 
[19:19] tjholowaychuk: if you are writting something trivial it shouldn't really be on node
[19:19] tiemonster: but not to get off-topic
[19:19] tjholowaychuk: you dont need a node powered blog etc lol
[19:19] bingomanatee: Drupal is for application prototyping. 
[19:19] tbranyen: chrisdickinson: yeah thats what i did, our client was pissed because they were seeing hashes
[19:19] frieza_ has joined the channel
[19:19] tbranyen: so i rewrote the admin
[19:19] icebox has joined the channel
[19:19] tbranyen: and that was a pain in the ass too
[19:19] bingomanatee: You can develop a site, get funding, and run with it for months before you have to build the whole thing up again from scratch. 
[19:19] chrisdickinson: tbranyen: oof. yeah. ):
[19:19] swaj: tjholowaychuk: I want to write a blog in node just as a learning exercise though.  I think it would be fun and easy.
[19:20] bingomanatee: Or weeks if you're "lucky"
[19:20] tjholowaychuk: swaj: for sure, for fun is totally different
[19:20] tiemonster: my point is that if you are developing a lot of applications, there is a lot of shared functionality that must be rewritten
[19:20] swaj: but first I need it to build :(
[19:20] tbranyen: unless you write it to be modular in the first place
[19:20] tiemonster: I think a blog is a perfect use case for Node.js
[19:20] tiemonster: if you think about it, they are I/O-bound applications
[19:20] tjholowaychuk: not unless you are uber famous
[19:20] icebox: tjholowaychuk: with 2.1.1 npm update and I get tar "-mvxpf" "-" "-C" "/usr/local/lib/node/.npm/express/2.1.1" tar: Unexpected EOF in archive
[19:21] tjholowaychuk: icebox: woah
[19:21] tiemonster: or any content-driven web site
[19:21] bingomanatee: its a perfect use case for learning node.js :D
[19:21] tjholowaychuk: icebox: works for me
[19:21] tiemonster: twitter clone, etc etc
[19:21] bingomanatee: I think games are the best use cases for node.js  at this point. And moile. 
[19:21] bingomanatee: mobile. 
[19:21] chrisdickinson: and file uploads!
[19:21] icebox: tjholowaychuk: ok :) any idea? on cygwin and node 0.4.3
[19:21] bingomanatee: Oh and it is a great platform for DDOS attacks 
[19:21] bingomanatee: IMHO
[19:22] bingomanatee: uh ... in theory ....
[19:22] chrisdickinson: haha
[19:23] tbranyen: bingomanatee: its a good general purpose scripting language too
[19:23] bingomanatee: But it is also probably a lot more DDOS resistant than anything else out there. 
[19:23] tiemonster: bandwidth is bandwidth
[19:23] bingomanatee: Yeah you could do fun bash stuff with it. 
[19:23] tbranyen: we need to create opengl bindings in node
[19:23] tbranyen: start doing native apps
[19:24] mikegerwitz: tbranyen: I think that's the goal of the web browser
[19:24] bingomanatee: I think there is more momentum for client slide 3D in the community. But that sort of thing is more likely to be backed by a game company

[19:24] ryah: udp in the web browser would be pretty hot
[19:24] tbranyen: so when you're stuck with tcp websockets
[19:25] tiemonster: node is great for chatty servers: smtp, irc, etc
[19:25] tiemonster: jabber
[19:25] wao: hm udp in browser :]
[19:25] tbranyen: ryah: tell me about it would <3 udp multicast for html5 video streaming
[19:25] dominictarr has joined the channel
[19:26] ryah: would be good for games
[19:26] tiemonster: tjholowaychuk: I guess I don't want to risk getting hoards of PHP script kiddies on board with Node.js
[19:26] tiemonster: I just think there is a better way to do common sorts of things
[19:26] tjholowaychuk: tiemonster: it's already begun lol look at all the ruby -> coffeescript ppl
[19:26] tjholowaychuk: for sure
[19:26] tjholowaychuk: it will evolve
[19:26] tbranyen: yeah i've been having issues with sending wiimote data to the client via websockets
[19:26] tjholowaychuk: when people agree on which common things should be added
[19:26] micheil: the problem with UDP in the browser is that the browser would have to open up a port
[19:27] tiemonster: perhaps a framework centered on web services instead of content-driven web sites
[19:27] tbranyen: end up having to throttle it
[19:27] softdrink: mmm. new imac at work
[19:27] tiemonster: micheil: flash does...
[19:27] tbranyen: micheil: there has been dicussion on adding in udp support in the past, just nobody has done it
[19:28] micheil: then you have to do a bunch of other things as well, like NAT traversal and shit
[19:28] tbranyen: http://www.jnext.org/
[19:28] tbranyen: ^^ saw that yesterday
[19:28] tschundeee: how should an express.js webapp be hostet? just by executing "node app.js" ?
[19:28] tbranyen: udp plugin basically
[19:28] tschundeee: hosted
[19:28] prettyrobots: tjholowaychuk: I should write a blog post on how I write web applications.
[19:28] tjholowaychuk: tschundeee: usually people use something like upstart + (cluster|multi-node|fugue)
[19:28] tschundeee: sry for my bad english... germany is playing football against australia :)
[19:28] tjholowaychuk: + monit
[19:28] tiemonster: tschundeee: for production or development?
[19:28] swaj: hmm
[19:28] prettyrobots: Because its basically connect for handling, and eco for templates.
[19:29] swaj: so it's building just fine on my OSX install, but Debian cries :(
[19:29] tschundeee: tiemonster: production
[19:29] tiemonster: yeah - I let Joyent handle that ;-D
[19:29] prettyrobots: The frameworky bits are three functions, sendObject, sendTemplate, sendText.
[19:29] prettyrobots: And that's about it.
[19:29] frieza_ has joined the channel
[19:29] tiemonster: I've been thinking about an app that creates upstart scripts for Node.js applications
[19:30] prettyrobots: Far less code than Rails, and no framework beyond "connect".
[19:30] tiemonster: prettyrobots: authentication is the first thing I thought of
[19:30] tiemonster: HTTP basic auth, HTTP digest auth, OAuth2
[19:30] prettyrobots: tiemonster: But, there are things that do that.
[19:30] prettyrobots: tiemonster: There is an oauth library out there.
[19:30] tiemonster: not plugable
[19:30] shafire has joined the channel
[19:30] shafire: hi
[19:30] prettyrobots: And if you use it, you don't need the other two.
[19:30] tiemonster: library != express.js middleware
[19:30] prettyrobots: Why does it need to be pluggable?
[19:31] tiemonster: so you don't have to rewrite that middleware every time
[19:31] prettyrobots: When are you going to unplug oauth and plugin in basic auth.
[19:31] tiemonster: you're missing the point
[19:31] tjholowaychuk: then make connect-oauth or w/e
[19:31] bingomanatee: Even though I do like MVC for backend personally I think you can probably do a fine app with everything in the public folder and a singluar web service gateway. 
[19:31] shafire: http://pastie.org/private/jjixqcn52h6sqamdh2w4a <-- what i am doing wrong? :(
[19:31] tjholowaychuk: or send a pullrequest and have require('oauth').middleware etc
[19:31] tiemonster: what about a cross-database ORM?
[19:31] prettyrobots: tiemonster: Yeah, well, my point is that rewriting the middleware is under ~100 lines of code.
[19:32] icebox: tjholowaychuk: I updated npm, connect and, at last, express. It is ok.
[19:32] tjholowaychuk: icebox: interesting
[19:32] tiemonster: prettyrobots: it all adds up
[19:32] prettyrobots: tiemonster: No, it doesn't.
[19:32] bingomanatee: tiemonster: I am going to bring that up in the noSQL meetup on the fifth. 
[19:32] tiemonster: an abstracted cache layer would be great (redis, memcached, database, fs, etc)
[19:33] tiemonster: an abstracted messaging layer (AMQP)
[19:33] marlun: Where can I find documentation about writing connect middleware? :)
[19:33] prettyrobots: I'm writing SQL again. It is so much more effective than Hibernate / ActiveRecord, to simply use a DSL to express queries, an mature DSL at that.
[19:33] tiemonster: I should have to reinvent authentication every time I sit down to write an application
[19:33] bingomanatee: I think the problem is that it is very simple to abstract get/put
[19:33] tjholowaychuk: marlun: it's a function that accepts (req, res, next){} you call next() with an optional exception
[19:33] tjholowaychuk: that's all there is to it
[19:34] bingomanatee: however searches and finds are very custom to the repo system. 
[19:34] tjholowaychuk: next() will pass control to the next "layer"
[19:34] bingomanatee: For instance Mongo is a freewheeling system that lets you search dynamically. 
[19:34] prettyrobots: tiemonster: You don't have to reinvent it, but it doesn't need to be "pluggable".
[19:34] bingomanatee: Couch requires your views be predefined. 
[19:34] prettyrobots: I can't unplug "eco" and plug in "mustache".
[19:35] f1lt3r_bocoup has joined the channel
[19:35] tiemonster: most frameworks don't support NoSQL because they are so "freewheeling"
[19:35] tiemonster: there is no shared api
[19:35] prettyrobots: I just use "eco", and I write a ~10 line function to do it, and it usually has some specialization for the application, and ~10 lines of code is about as complicated as ~10 lines of pluggable configuration files.
[19:35] bingomanatee: Doctrine is the only exception I can think of. 
[19:36] m00p has joined the channel
[19:36] bingomanatee: Honestly I like the idea in practice - I think however that the reality is that you would discover fairly soon that the net result is a system that doesn't respect the unique strengths of the system
[19:36] tjholowaychuk: yeah I agree
[19:37] prettyrobots: So, get an "oauth" library I'm sure you can use it with connect with about as much complexity as a "pluggable" framework (less complexity, probably an order of magnitude, it's just that the complexity is buried in the framework.)
[19:37] bingomanatee: For instance the Couch guys would be saying, "why do you need an ORM for a system that is 100% REST based?" 
[19:37] mraleph has joined the channel
[19:37] tjholowaychuk: bingomanatee: it's like trying to get every template engine to behave the same haha, it totally defeats the purpose
[19:37] bingomanatee: so then you make an ORM that is REST based and the Mongo guys bitch that "You lose all the efficiency of Mongo if you don't use binary bindings"
[19:38] bingomanatee: And I'll tell you what the other guys would bitch about after the 5th :D
[19:38] tiemonster: but what if six months into a project, I find that MongoDB is going to meet my needs better than Couch - I have rewrite
[19:39] bingomanatee: Mongoose takes a bout 3 days to "get" 
[19:39] bingomanatee: (if yoiu read my missing manual anyway) 
[19:39] bingomanatee: If you get that deep into a project and find out that your repo's fucked you are basically some degree of fucked. 
[19:39] tjholowaychuk: tiemonster: you would most likely have to if you are going to actually utilize the features anyway
[19:39] tiemonster: but Mongoose is only for MongoDB. What if I jump head-long into Mongoose and code it all up, then decide that Redis is going to work better because of how my data looks?

[19:42] bingomanatee: Honestly - before I even started trusting Mongoose I had a lightweight ORM working in mongo native that was reasonably good. 
[19:42] tjholowaychuk: shafire: hmm seems like npm might be doing something wrong

[19:45] bingomanatee: if you have a node_modules folder in your project, do npm install express FROM INSIDE YOUR PROJECT FOLDER and it will stick express (and co. ) in your node_modules folder. 
[19:46] bingomanatee: Which is pretty neat. 
[19:46] bingomanatee: then you have your stuff "bundled" in your project.

[19:57] tiemonster: tjholowaychuk: if a route exists in express, but not a handler for a defined method, shouldn't it return 405 Not Implemented instead of 404 Not Found ?
[19:57] kuhrt: how do I direct nodejs to listen to locahost instead of a specific port? for instance I have my domain name work like this `http://thievishfilms.ca:8000/` but not this http://thievishfilms.ca/
[19:58] tjholowaychuk: tiemonster: the 404 is from connect
[19:58] tjholowaychuk: if it has nothing left to do it's 404, but yeah we could possibly use something else
[19:58] tiemonster: tjholowaychuk: patches welcome? ;-)
[19:58] tjholowaychuk: tiemonster: maybe 400
[19:59] dominictarr has joined the channel
[19:59] tjholowaychuk: tiemonster: for what you are saying 405 sounds good, but they are all treated the same ATM
[19:59] tiemonster: If I have app.get('/test', ... and I PUT to /test I should get 405
[19:59] tjholowaychuk: we dont check and say "oh hey this route is defined but not for this method"
[19:59] tjholowaychuk: connect just says "oh shit, I've not been handled, do something"
[19:59] tjholowaychuk: haha
[20:00] tiemonster: so does this need to be altered in connect or express?
[20:00] tjholowaychuk: to do otherwise would consider end-points "special"
[20:00] tjholowaychuk: not just regular middleware
[20:00] tjholowaychuk: you would have to couple connect to the router middleware
[20:00] tjholowaychuk: which I'd rather not do
[20:00] tiemonster: hmm. I have an idea.
[20:01] tjholowaychuk: you could do it yourself, just add a middleware at the bottom that catches anything unhandled
[20:01] vckt has joined the channel
[20:01] tjholowaychuk: i want to refactor the router sometime to make it easier to do stuff like app.get('/foo') to grab the handler for that

[20:10] tjholowaychuk: tiemonster: cant remember, i dont think so, it will just pass through like anything else in express
[20:10] tjholowaychuk: which has benefits
[20:11] alessio_alex: tjholowaychuk hello, this code doesn't work anymore: var MemStore = require('connect/middleware/session/memory');
[20:11] tjholowaychuk: alessio_alex: require('connect').session.MemoryStore
[20:11] alessio_alex: thanks!
[20:11] tiemonster: tjholowaychuk: I'll just make a generic method for returning not implemented, and plugin it in where it makes sense

[20:23] Gigawatt: http://pastebin.com/fwAxyjrK
[20:23] Gigawatt: it says that the HttpServer has no method start !
[20:23] MatthewS: well, getting to the point of having the equivalent of a few features i use in apache logging would be a start
[20:23] tjholowaychuk: MatthewS: what I do is have // debug: foo etc within my files, and with those you can strip the "// debug :" portion conditionally using node's extension registration api
[20:23] tiemonster: MatthewS: it's pretty trivial to implement as a middleware
[20:23] tjholowaychuk: but
[20:23] tjholowaychuk: something built-in as a middlware would be nice

[20:30] tbranyen: the api has changed quite a bit
[20:30] tbranyen: Gigawatt: you can't just make a reload function and overwrite the variable with a new require?
[20:30] springify has joined the channel
[20:31] Gigawatt: no because the new require fetches the data from the cache right
[20:31] Gigawatt: meaning it does not get updated
[20:31] tbranyen: oh it does?
[20:31] Gigawatt: console.log(require.cache)
[20:31] tbranyen: interesting
[20:31] tbranyen: Gigawatt: hmmm probably not advisable to alter that cache in the reload function either?
[20:31] techwraith has joined the channel
[20:32] Gigawatt: i would like to soo something like: require.cache.reload('custom_config')

[20:33] Gigawatt: well yea, but only use defined files, all native modules such as util,http,https etc would not get reloaded
[20:33] tbranyen: Gigawatt: from what i see they don't get stored in the cache anyways
[20:34] Gigawatt: yup, i have tested the other day, you can remove them by getting the full path to your module and doing:

[20:47] ChrisOnNode: ?
[20:47] Gigawatt: ChrisOnNode: are you talking about a callback ?
[20:48] jonaslund: Gigawatt: node still works best on *nix systems and probably will work as well there. most of the recent changes are just to make it "sane" on windows aswell
[20:48] ryah: Gigawatt: discussing windows currently
[20:48] ryah: privately
[20:49] Sean_Colombo: ChrisOnNode: redis probably isn't the best place to hold a queue
[20:49] Gigawatt: ryah, yea i think it was in a lecture you was giving, its not a problem just interested in the roadmap
[20:49] Sean_Colombo: ChrisOnNode: *to hold an event queue
[20:49] ChrisOnNode: I am talking about having a process written in anothe language (ex: PHP or C++) that passa task to NODE.js and node execute when there is work to do.
[20:50] Sean_Colombo: ChrisOnNode: maybe rabbitMQ or something would be better suited if you have a lot of data going through

[20:50] ryah: Gigawatt: in a few months windows support should be very good

[20:51] Gigawatt: ryah: that's great (that your not leaving *windows* users out)
[20:52] ChrisOnNode: Not too much data... I am using redis for other things and I though that brpop and blpop where designed for this purpouse.

[20:56] mjr_: ChrisOnNode: you can use redis blocking pop for that, sure
[20:57] Gigawatt: ryah: have you thought about the management of the require.cache? it would be helpful if we can require a fresh copy of a js config for, and specify the update_cache with the 2nd param on require
[20:57] ChrisOnNode: mjr_: How does it work?
[20:57] ChrisOnNode: in node.js
[20:57] ryah: Gigawatt: i think you can just clear require.cache, then it will load a fresh one.
[20:58] Gigawatt: new_copy = require('./configs/dynamic_config' [, update_cache = true])
[20:58] mjr_: ChrisOnNode: you get a callback when an item is ready.  It works the way you'd want and expect.
[20:58] Gigawatt: ryah, yea but that requires the full path, meaning that we have to use several other lines to get the full URI Path etc, i thought it would be nice if we could just specify the update of cache
[21:00] ChrisOnNode: mjr_: it does not seem to work for me. This is my code:
[21:00] ChrisOnNode: 	client.brpop("tasks", 0, function(err, res){ 		if (err) 		if (res =="null") 		{ 			mylog("The task is "+res); 		} 		else 		{ 			mylog("null task: do nothing"); 		}

[21:25] Poetro: isaacs: I update npm to 0.3.18, but the cygwin issue still stands... when i want to update multiple modules, it errors, when i do individual it succeeds https://gist.github.com/893343
[21:25] isaacs: Poetro: yeah, i made it a bit better on 1.0.1rc1
[21:25] isaacs: Poetro: but the 0.3 family will probably continue to suck on cygwin a lot forever.

[21:31] mscdex: thegreatape: unless you manually apply the fix in that issue thread

[23:16] brianc: http://explodemy.com:3001/grid.html
[23:17] tjholowaychuk: brianc: in your opinion should "50 + 50% == 75"
[23:17] tjholowaychuk: or 100
[23:17] tjholowaychuk: it currently disregards the %, but I might change it

[23:18] bradleymeck: 75
[23:18] tjholowaychuk: k, cool
[23:18] bradleymeck: lol im not brianc tj but thanks
[23:19] brianc: haha, the addition might make sense
[23:19] tjholowaychuk: haha
[23:19] brianc: but might start getting crazy w/ multiplication
[23:19] tjholowaychuk: yeah i know, just wanted an opinion
[23:19] tjholowaychuk: yeah + / - might be the only ones making sense there
[23:19] brianc: 50% * 2
[23:19] jacobolus has joined the channel
[23:19] brianc: what that be? 1? 100%?
[23:19] tjholowaychuk: 50% * 2 would be 100%
[23:19] tjholowaychuk: 2 * 50% would be 3
[23:20] brianc: sweetness 
[23:20] brianc: i must leave office now
[23:20] tjholowaychuk: but 50 > 50% etc should probably disregard the %
[23:20] brianc: yea
[23:20] ParadoxQuine has joined the channel
[23:21] brianc: "greater than 50%.....of what? I accidentally the whole 50%"
[23:21] gazumps has joined the channel

[23:24] ckknight: do people recommend any particular testing frameworks for node.js?
[23:25] markwubben has joined the channel
[23:25] atmos: ckknight: i've had the most success with vows
[23:25] jesusabdullah: ckknight: In my experience, people seem to either like expresso or vows
[23:25] jesusabdullah: I've used expresso for some things, it's nice and lightweight
[23:26] jesusabdullah: I'd look at both and choose the one that makes you most happy
[23:26] tjholowaychuk: ckknight: vows == better looking, nodeunit == easy / slower, expresso == ugly / faster
[23:26] tjholowaychuk: most people use one of those three
[23:26] jesusabdullah: orite, nodeunit too
[23:26] jesusabdullah: idk much about nodeunit
[23:26] ckknight: good tips
[23:27] tjholowaychuk: ckknight: what are you testing?
[23:27] tjholowaychuk: expresso is better suited for testing frameworks etc, not really apps, but it depends
[23:27] ckknight: I haven't started yet, still assessing, but it'll be a facebook game running on top of node.js
[23:27] Me1000 has joined the channel
[23:27] ckknight: (if I decide to go with node.js)
[23:28] sprout has joined the channel
[23:29] sveisvei has joined the channel
[23:29] jimt_ has joined the channel
[23:30] ckknight: so for such an app, vows would be better than expresso, tjholowaychuk?
[23:30] tjholowaychuk: ckknight: expresso would probably be fine for that
[23:31] tjholowaychuk: though call, they all have pros/cons
[23:31] atmos: best bet for unbiased answers, ask the author of one of them
[23:31] tjholowaychuk: haha
[23:31] jesusabdullah: ckknight: You should definitely go with node.js.
[23:31] atmos: :)
[23:31] jesusabdullah: ;)
[23:31] tjholowaychuk: im not pushing expresso :p
[23:31] matyr_ has joined the channel
[23:31] ckknight: tjholowaychuk: but are you the author? :P
[23:32] tjholowaychuk: just saying vows looks better, expresso has potential to be faster but less managable (depending on what you are testing)
[23:32] ckknight: jesusabdullah: why do you say that? ;-) // flame war commence
[23:32] tjholowaychuk: and nodeunit is kind of a combination, but runs serially so its slower
[23:32] jesusabdullah: v8: function steve() {return "DEVELOPERS" + steve()' }

[23:32] jesusabdullah: tssch
[23:32] ckknight: extra ' there
[23:32] jesusabdullah: oh, that's right
[23:33] jesusabdullah: Also, can you add strings? I've been doing a lot of python lately
[23:33] jesusabdullah: v8: function steve() {return "DEVELOPERS" + steve() }
[23:33] v8bot: jesusabdullah: undefined
[23:33] jesusabdullah: v8: function steve() {return "DEVELOPERS" + steve() }; steve()

[23:33] jesusabdullah: There we go
[23:33] jesusabdullah: I'm cool with a broken stack size ;)
[23:33] jesusabdullah: Man I really need to play with node-lazy

[23:36] c4milo has joined the channel
[23:36] jesusabdullah: Oh, umm, but ckknight, you asked why node? Personally, I like that it's javascript (and with facebook, I believe their javascript API is one of the more complete ones), and that it's fast
[23:36] jesusabdullah: It also has some really cool modules, and npm is awesomely lightweight.
[23:36] ckknight: "fast" is relative
[23:37] ckknight: also, the concept of going to a non-RDBMS solution after using them (RDBMSes) for so long is slightly frightening to wrap my head around
[23:37] jesusabdullah: Well
[23:37] jesusabdullah: sure it's relative
[23:37] techwraith has joined the channel
[23:37] jesusabdullah: but relative to a lot of your other likely choices. I mean, are you considering java? >_<
[23:37] jesusabdullah: Anyways
[23:37] ChrisOnNode: Quick questio: Do I need to require somethign to use JSON.Stringfy... and what is the opposite? I cannot find in the documentation
[23:38] jesusabdullah: What do you mean by a RDBMS solution?
[23:38] atmos: ChrisOnNode: nope they're there by default
[23:38] isaacs: ckknight: your choice of tool should depend on the job you have.
[23:38] atmos: JSON.stringify and JSON.parse
[23:38] ckknight: my dayjob is working in C#, jesusabdullah, and I've been able to get 10k pages served per second off a single development box :P
[23:38] jesusabdullah: Ah
[23:38] isaacs: ckknight: the biggest things about node, why you'd choose it, imo, come down to the community, the language, and the way that it handles IO.
[23:38] ChrisOnNode: Thanks
[23:38] ckknight: I doubt node.js could match that, but I accept that
[23:38] jesusabdullah: Yeah, sure
[23:39] isaacs: ckknight: i've seen node do more than double that on my macbook
[23:39] tjholowaychuk: god damn coffeescript man
[23:39] ckknight: isaacs: my job in this case will be a hobby project where I made a facebook game for fun.
[23:39] tjholowaychuk: its everywhere
[23:39] isaacs: ckknight: but i mean, that's a hello world thing
[23:39] jesusabdullah: isaacs is someone good to listen to here.
[23:39] ckknight: isaacs: not a hello world thing, a full app that varies from user-to-user.
[23:39] ChrisOnNode: Is there a way to find the current function name ?
[23:39] atmos: hello world performance metrics ftw!
[23:39] isaacs: ckknight: in real life, you're usually bound by something that *isn't* going to be able to manage 10k rps
[23:39] ckknight: too true.
[23:39] isaacs: node makes it easy to have a lightweight app server in front of multiple things, and not be blocked by them
[23:40] jesusabdullah: I guess my confusion re: RDBMS is that you can use databases from node without too much hassle, but maybe I misunderstand what you mean by rdbms
[23:40] ckknight: my ultimate goal will be to support 100k users per month doing around 1 request every 10 seconds for a total of 15 minutes each per day or so
[23:40] isaacs: the single-threaded evented approach to asynchronous IO is pretty easy to wrap your brain around, compared with threads or coroutines (MY OPINION! omg get the fire extinguishers out...)
[23:40] jesusabdullah: I agree.
[23:41] ckknight: jesusabdullah: traditional SQL servers are RDBMS if used properly, e.g. PostgreSQL, SQL Server, or *shudder* MySQL
[23:41] isaacs: ckknight: so, what you have is:  a primarily javascript frontend, and a bunch of data flying around the place?
[23:41] johnnywengluu: anyone knows how this type of documentation is generated? https://github.com/cloudhead/vows
[23:41] isaacs: ckknight: and you're doing it for fun.
[23:41] atmos: roflscale discussion imminent
[23:41] jesusabdullah: It actually makes me go "wtf" inside when I see python people decry callbacks
[23:41] isaacs: ckknight: i dunno, seems like a really good fit for node.
[23:41] ckknight: isaacs: yep, one-page app, all JSON-driven data
[23:41] johnnywengluu: actually i meant this one: http://vowsjs.org/
[23:41] johnnywengluu: and htis one: http://lesscss.org/
[23:41] scrogson has joined the channel
[23:41] ckknight: and I'd horizontally scale it by having multiple node.js nodes communicating through a load balancer (if I reach that point of traffic)
[23:42] isaacs: ckknight: (for fun) you want a good community that's active, (js frontend) so having a js backend is a nice win, native JSON parsing, etc., and (lotta data) that's sorta what node is *for*
[23:42] johnnywengluu: is it a template engine that is converting a markup lang (markdown, textile) into html?
[23:42] altamic has joined the channel
[23:42] isaacs: ckknight: there are very few load balancers that can keep node servers maxed out
[23:42] ckknight: isaacs: well, the "for fun" thing basically means that I won't be doing it for pay, but if it becomes successful, I'd totally sell out.
[23:42] willwhite has joined the channel
[23:42] isaacs: ckknight: you'd be better off writing a load balancer in node.
[23:42] jesusabdullah: cloudhead: How did you make vowsjs.org and lesscss.org look so pretty? johnnywengluu wants to know.
[23:43] isaacs: ckknight: :) won't we all
[23:43] ckknight: isaacs: perhaps, or maybe nginx with port redirection or something
[23:43] johnnywengluu: jesusabdullah: good initiative =)
[23:43] ckknight: I dunno
[23:43] ckknight: far off.
[23:43] jesusabdullah: johnnywengluu: He may have done it by hand
[23:43] altamic has left the channel
[23:43] isaacs: ckknight: also, while there's only one thread per server process, you can easily have multiple processes that share a file descriptor, and then the kernel does your load balancing for you.  what's what cluster does.
[23:43] isaacs: ckknight: and, incidentally, it's also part of how nginx gets such good performance.
[23:44] isaacs: ckknight: nginx is a good file server, but not a great proxy.  no web sockets, no streaming data, etc.
[23:44] jesusabdullah: The truth is, I just think node.js is *fun*.
[23:44] jesusabdullah: Oddly enough
[23:44] isaacs: ckknight: if you absolutely must use a proxy, i'd go with haproxy, varnish, or squid
[23:44] jesusabdullah: for some reason, I find it fun to work with
[23:44] ckknight: well, ideally, I'd want the same user (or even IP) to hit the same process over and over
[23:44] isaacs: you could put the sessions and such in redis
[23:44] ckknight: rather than round-robining
[23:44] isaacs: then it wouldn't matter which 'server" process they hit
[23:44] dgathright has joined the channel
[23:44] jesusabdullah: I don't really care much about performance and shit, with what I do, so that's seriously all it comes down to. Fun. *shrug*
[23:44] ckknight: yeah, potentially
[23:44] isaacs: they'd get the first one to read() from the socket
[23:45] ckknight: I'm currently only in the design stages, trying to research as much before diving in head-first
[23:45] jesusabdullah: Hmm
[23:45] jesusabdullah: I think it's hometime
[23:46] ckknight: any recommendations for short-term caching with node.js?
[23:46] ckknight: I've used memcached in the past when I did python and ruby work
[23:46] ryah: redis
[23:47] ryah: has a nice cache-warmer too
[23:50] ckknight: What IDE do people recommend using if I were to do development on OS X? I've pretty much just used TextMate in the past.
[23:50] Sorens3n: cloud9 :D
[23:50] eyesUnclouded has joined the channel
[23:51] ckknight: ooh, creepy
[23:51] johnnywengluu: ckknight: but its not fully qualified yet
[23:51] atmos: ckknight: i think that most people just use vim, emacs or textmate
[23:51] johnnywengluu: imho .. give it 6 months more
[23:51] Sorens3n: yeah i'm half teasing, i dont have a mac
[23:51] ckknight: johnnywengluu: referring to cloud9?
[23:51] johnnywengluu: ckknight: yeah
[23:51] johnnywengluu: use WebStorm in the mean time
[23:51] Sorens3n: im running around with n++
[23:51] johnnywengluu: i mean meanwhile
[23:52] st-17178 has joined the channel
[23:52] isaacs: ckknight: I used TextMate until switching to Vim a few months ago
[23:52] eee_c has joined the channel
[23:52] ckknight: WebStorm looks pretty snazzy
[23:52] isaacs: if cloud9 gets vim bindings, i'll take a closer look ;)
[23:52] johnnywengluu: cause you will need more cloud9 support of details like running ruby (a lot of gems i use in development)
[23:53] isaacs: ckknight: i think there's some plugin love for Eclipse, too
[23:53] isaacs: can do debugging and stuff in it
[23:53] isaacs: but it's no visual studio
[23:53] tjholowaychuk: ckknight: I use textmate as well, but plan on switching to vim when I have time to learn it better
[23:53] johnnywengluu: ckknight: its the best ide on the dsktop
[23:53] tjholowaychuk: and if my eyes dont explode from staring at black all day
[23:53] johnnywengluu: with its auto indexing .. so hot .. you just click on a method or class it'll jump to that one
[23:53] ckknight: Vim seems great if this were still the 90s
[23:53] ckknight: flamewar, commence!
[23:53] johnnywengluu: also great auto formatting
[23:53] useware: johnnywengluu: you can install cloud9 locally and run ruby
[23:54] johnnywengluu: useware: yeah that is one option
[23:54] johnnywengluu: but still they dont have indexing like webstorm
[23:54] johnnywengluu: why i said give it some couple of months if not 1 year =)
[23:54] useware: johnnywengluu: sure
[23:54] johnnywengluu: since webstorm has been in the market a looooooong time they have almost every feature you can think of
[23:55] ckknight: what database do people normally use when running node? mongodb or something else?
[23:55] johnnywengluu: indexing is a real time saver ... you dont get it til you use it .. just fucking click =)
[23:55] Sorens3n: has anyone tested dnode + browserify lately?
[23:56] johnnywengluu: ckknight: couchdb is pretty awesome
[23:56] ChrisOnNode: Hi
[23:56] johnnywengluu: json, http restful api, javascript, map reduce
[23:56] ChrisOnNode: Other quick question
[23:56] isaacs: ckknight: depends on your needs.
[23:56] ChrisOnNode: I am trying to use http.request
[23:56] johnnywengluu: also web gui
[23:56] ChrisOnNode: And I get : node.js:134         throw e; // process.nextTick error, or 'error' event on first tick         ^ Error: socket hang up     at Socket.<anonymous> (http.js:1265:45)     at Socket.emit (events.js:64:17)     at Array.<anonymous> (net.js:825:12)     at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:126:26)
[23:56] isaacs: ckknight: if you need your all of your data, then you probably want something other than mongodb
[23:56] isaacs: ;)
[23:57] ChrisOnNode: What does it mean ?
[23:57] johnnywengluu: isaacs: =)
[23:57] ckknight: isaacs: what do you mean need all of my data?
[23:57] dominictarr has joined the channel
[23:57] isaacs: ckknight: i mean, if you want to know that every write succeeded, and be able to recover in the event of a crash, even at scale.
[23:57] johnnywengluu: ckknight: mongodb is kinda good for logging stuff
[23:57] isaacs: ckknight: there are very many use cases where that is not the case, i'm not being facetious
[23:57] ckknight: isaacs: I know about eventual consistency and all that :P
[23:57] isaacs: well... that's the thing...
[23:58] isaacs: "eventual consistency" is only an actual guarantee if it's a guarantee.
[23:58] ckknight: if some writes don't go through, I plan on accomodating for it, not breaking because of it
[23:58] [[zzz]] has joined the channel
[23:58] isaacs: ckknight: right, just be careful.  don't pull a 4square
[23:58] ckknight: so I realize that downfall to the typical NoSQL implementations
[23:58] ckknight: oh, what happened with them?
[23:58] isaacs: ckknight: they had a node go down, then all their nodes went down as a result

[23:59] ckknight: sounds like poor architecting
[23:59] isaacs: ckknight: if you actually need all your data, and especially if you are doing more reads than writes, then couchdb is pretty much perfect.
[23:59] st-17217 has joined the channel
[23:59] ckknight: mine will be pretty write-heavy
[23:59] isaacs: riak is also quite nice, if you have gaziggabytes of data that needs to be super available always everywhere
