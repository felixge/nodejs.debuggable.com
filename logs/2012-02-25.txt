[00:08] tjholowaychuk: krebipeti you dont have to..
[00:08] tenthfloor: can anyone give me a hint here
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: move them into more files
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: structure is on you the developer, but you dont have to put them in one file

[00:49] timoxley: batousai as in, access a node server?
[00:50] isao has left the channel
[00:50] timoxley: batousai make your node server listen on some port, then access localhost:3000 where 3000 is the port your specified
[00:50] satyr has joined the channel
[00:51] batousai: timoxley, the script isnt a server
[00:51] timoxley: batousai what is it
[00:51] batousai: timoxley, it is a scraper
[00:52] Skaag has joined the channel
[00:52] timoxley: batousai node doesn't -run in the browser-. you can get it to serve static files to the browser though.
[00:52] batousai: timoxley, static files. i see
[00:52] timoxley: but it sounds like you've just written some kind of runnable script. you can run it with `node myscript.js`
[00:53] hipsterslapfight has joined the channel
[00:53] timoxley: batousai but if all your app is doing is serving a static file, then you probably don't need ndoe
[00:53] batousai: timoxley, yes but now i need to use a function/object that is only available in my browser
[00:53] VladGh has joined the channel
[00:53] timoxley: batousai what function
[00:53] batousai: timoxley, location
[00:54] batousai: timoxley, like location.href
[00:54] slaskis has joined the channel
[00:54] timoxley: batousai I don't get it.
[00:54] batousai: timoxley, http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_location.asp
[00:55] timoxley: batousai no, but why does your serverside script need that
[00:56] batousai: timoxley, i was initially looking for a javascript scraper. it was only a coincidence that it was written in nodejs
[00:56] ningu: if it's written for nodejs it doesn't need to access location
[00:56] slaskis has joined the channel
[00:57] iangreenleaf has joined the channel
[00:57] timoxley: batousai ok, you can't run nodejs code in the browser. your scraper will run serverside, and you can pass it a url via commandline or something. 
[00:57] batousai: it cant handle <meta http-equiv="refresh"
[00:57] timoxley: batousai wat
[00:58] ohtogo has joined the channel
[00:58] timoxley: node can't handle http-equiv="refresh"?
[00:58] batousai: the meta tag has an attribute called content
[00:58] batousai: i need to go to the url inside that attribute but the module i am using cant handle that
[00:59] timoxley: batousai what module are you using
[00:59] batousai: node.io
[00:59] batousai: node.io integrates request.js which cant handle it either
[00:59] jesusabdullah: what is node.io ?
[01:00] timoxley: oh man. are you trying to load the node.io files in your browser?
[01:00] batousai: node.io is a scraper
[01:00] StanlySoManly has joined the channel
[01:00] batousai: timoxley, yes when i heard that "location" is in my browser
[01:01] kvey: batousai: are you running node from the command line or are you attempting to use node.io from your web browser?
[01:01] jesusabdullah: I always just made my own danged jsdom
[01:01] jesusabdullah: with some jqueries
[01:01] jesusabdullah: g2g
[01:01] batousai: kvey, i am running it from the commandline right now
[01:01] rwaldron has joined the channel
[01:01] batousai: node.io integrated jsdom too
[01:02] ningu: I've been using cheerio since someone told me about it
[01:02] ningu: works better than jsdom for my purposes
[01:02] timoxley: batousai yeah, you will need to always use it from the commandline. it doesn't just work out of the box in the browser
[01:02] batousai_ has joined the channel
[01:02] batousai_: i got disconnected....
[01:03] bradleyg has joined the channel
[01:03] batousai_: <ningu>	works better than jsdom for my purposes
[01:03] batousai_: last thing i saw
[01:03] timoxley: batousai_ ok yeah, so node.io will only work as a commandline app. 
[01:04] timoxley: batousai_ you cant (typically) just dump node code into a browser and have it work.
[01:04] timoxley: batousai_ unless the library has been specifically designed to allow that
[01:05] batousai_: timoxley, so how will i redirect if the page uses the refresh attribute from the meta tag?
[01:05] timoxley: batousai_ there is no such thing as 'redirect' on the serverside
[01:05] maxogden: 302 doggy
[01:05] timoxley: batousai_ the script just runs.
[01:06] huggies has joined the channel
[01:06] timoxley: batousai so you're saying, the scraper doesn't take into account meta tags like refresh
[01:06] batousai: right
[01:07] batousai: it cant handle this <meta http-equiv=refresh content="1;URL='/blah/blah/blah.do?blahblah=1330131945192-437'"/>
[01:07] timoxley: batousai perhaps use jquery (on the serverside) to manually implement that
[01:07] dwarfy has joined the channel
[01:08] batousai: timoxley, if jquery has a similar location object i would be happy to do so

[01:09] timoxley: batousai your serverside script surely knows what domain it's accessing? just do a path.join(domainImOn, stuffInRefreshURL)
[01:09] timoxley: batousai you might need to do some regex to extract the url
[01:10] Joeysomo has joined the channel

[06:56] Emmanuel`: Is there a best-practice to modify something on a node server without restarting it ? With "classical" framework, one can change a PHP script (or whatever), since the PHP script is executed on request, if it is changed, the change will take effect on the next request
[06:56] Emmanuel`: in the case of node, mostly everything is loaded at once
[06:56] Emmanuel`: therefore, how can I notify the server of a change without restarting it ?
[06:57] Emmanuel`: that's probably a trivial thing to do, as there are quite a few framework written with node
[06:57] Emmanuel`: but I coulnd't find any leads so far
[06:57] westg: nodemon ^
[06:57] westg: nodemon app.js
[06:57] westg: or forever -w app.js
[06:58] Emmanuel`: yeah but it still reloads the server, no ?
[06:58] gigafied has joined the channel
[06:58] westg: you have to restart the server
[06:58] westg: that's just how it is
[06:58] westg: if you directly alter the js file
[06:58] Emmanuel`: typically, I'm building an application to be hit by my regular, PHP CMS
[06:58] ekryski has joined the channel
[06:59] Emmanuel`: I have a node interface to the DB server, that node interface performs some background tasks.
[06:59] Emmanuel`: then push them back to the PHP CMS
[06:59] Emmanuel`: (as I don't want the PHP CMS to hung until that task is performed, as it can take a bit of time)
[07:00] Nuck: Emmanuel`: Most restart systems are pretty well-designed for Node, they'll start a second instance of hte server, and then wait for the connections on the old one to stop before killing it
[07:00] Nuck: So it's pretty much seamless
[07:00] Emmanuel`: oic
[07:00] Emmanuel`: that sounds cool
[07:00] Nuck: At least, that's how forever works, IIRC
[07:00] Nuck: Or was that haibu... It was something
[07:01] Nuck: Maybe that was cluster?
[07:01] Nuck: ACTION shrugs
[07:01] Nuck: Who knows.
[07:01] Emmanuel`: haha
[07:01] Emmanuel`: haibu seems to do that
[07:01] Emmanuel`: but basically, that means I have several instance
[07:02] Emmanuel`: some kind of a connector that receives the request
[07:02] Emmanuel`: and pass them to active node instance
[07:02] Emmanuel`: if I perform some code I just activate a new instance and instruct the connector to hit the new one while the old one runs until it dies
[07:03] Emmanuel`: a ibt like a load balancer would do (except that I don't use it to balance the load)
[07:03] Emmanuel`: I guess that answers my question, thanks !

[08:20] jesusabdullah: yes.
[08:21] devaholic: ... oh an email
[08:21] jesusabdullah: though, writing a vows macro ("macro") that asserts some jshints could be handy
[08:21] graeme_f has joined the channel
[08:21] jesusabdullah: but only given a relatively liberal threshhold
[08:22] jesusabdullah: keep in mind, of course, that I tend to use vows a lot due to the code bases I work with
[08:22] jesusabdullah: and other testing frameworks not as much
[08:22] devaholic: vows is alright, i like tap
[08:22] padd173 has joined the channel

[08:22] maxogden: hay guys whats up its 12:22 am and im blasting http://escism.net/omfgdogs
[08:23] jesusabdullah: like, there was definitely a time where tap would've been my first choice

[08:24] jesusabdullah: yeah
[08:24] devaholic: i dont follow jitsu too closely
[08:24] tuhoojabotti: ACTION has no tests
[08:24] devaholic: because you guys can do that :)
[08:24] jesusabdullah: I mean, to be fair, jitsu has a lot of equivalent cases
[08:25] AvianFlu: the new test suite is waaaaaay better than the old one
[08:25] devaholic: maxogden, why cant i close it?
[08:25] AvianFlu: the old one was like that car you had to push downhill with somebody in the driver's seat to pop the clutch
[08:25] jesusabdullah: like, 'jitsu deploy' and 'jitsu apps deploy' are equivalent, and 'jitsu apps start myApp' and 'jitsu apps start myUsername/myApp' are equivalent as well
[08:25] jesusabdullah: It's true
[08:25] devaholic: nice
[08:25] graeme_f: as a newbie I have to say I found vows quite confusing
[08:25] jesusabdullah: oh, yeah, and we're using nock right now
[08:26] AvianFlu: graeme_f, it's wordy, but it works well when you get used to it
[08:26] jesusabdullah: graeme_f: I'll grant you that one.
[08:26] AvianFlu: the abstraction is a little dense
[08:26] devaholic: i would like to see some kind of git push equivalent where i dont have to interact with anything
[08:26] jesusabdullah: graeme_f: My chief complaint about vows is that barriers of entry are too high
[08:26] graeme_f: trying to get my head around how the async stuff at the same time as learning vows made it much harder
[08:26] illourr has joined the channel
[08:26] illourr: whatsup
[08:27] jesusabdullah: graeme_f: You've seen node-tap? it's pretty easy to wrap your head around
[08:27] jesusabdullah: I do wonder, though, if better docs for vows would make it more straightforward
[08:27] devaholic: graeme_f, tap is pretty much the opposite of vows
[08:27] graeme_f: jesusabdullah: no, i switched to mocha
[08:27] jesusabdullah: mocha??!
[08:27] jesusabdullah: Doesn't mocha have like 30 keywords?
[08:28] jesusabdullah: vows reminds me of rspec, if anyone's used that
[08:28] graeme_f: i've used jasmine before so mocha is easy to pick up from there :)
[08:28] jesusabdullah: oh, sure
[08:28] jesusabdullah: my second choice after vows is still tap, definitely
[08:29] jesusabdullah: I have some issues with tap but I'm still trying to figure out how to properly articulate them
[08:29] graeme_f: devaholic jesusabdullah i'll have a look at tap then, although at some point i need to stop messing with stuff and build something ;)
[08:29] jesusabdullah: and even if I could I'd probably still chalk it up to "diffr'nt strokes"
[08:29] graeme_f: won't be today, got lots of work work (C#) to do :(
[08:30] jesusabdullah: c#? Sad?
[08:30] jesusabdullah: heh
[08:30] graeme_f: it's not fun like node! ;)
[08:30] tuhoojabotti: hey hoo
[08:30] tuhoojabotti: github now supports file editing online?
[08:30] tuhoojabotti: not only readme
[08:30] jesusabdullah: I read about c# sometimes on my time off
[08:30] jesusabdullah: particularly wrt mono
[08:30] graeme_f: oh yeah?
[08:31] jesusabdullah: and, like, 50% of me thinks, "hey this looks almost nice" and the other half is like, "waitaminute this is xml and all the tooling expects you to use visual studio FUCK THIS"
[08:31] jesusabdullah: and I haven't figured out which side wins yet
[08:31] graeme_f: i've never actaully tried mono, i've been on windows since '95 and although i've messed with ubuntu and stuff i've only just switched to OS X :)
[08:31] graeme_f: lol
[08:32] jesusabdullah: like, I feel like you could end up with a pretty sweet gig if you got nuget.exe integrated into monodevelop alright
[08:32] graeme_f: vs2010 + resharper + ncrunch is very very productive imo
[08:32] jesusabdullah: and, like, just
[08:32] jesusabdullah: stopped worrying and learned to love the auto-generated code
[08:32] graeme_f: i really miss ncrunch when working in javascript
[08:32] jesusabdullah: not familiar with ncrunch
[08:32] jesusabdullah: like I said I just read about it
[08:32] jesusabdullah: I haven't actually, y'know, written anything in c# XD
[08:33] graeme_f: jesusabdullah check out the video http://www.ncrunch.net/ and let me know if i can get something similar in node :)
[08:34] graeme_f: basically it runs tests as you type and shows line by line code coverage in real time
[08:34] benvie: I'm still iterating on this
[08:34] jesusabdullah: okay these dots are confusing the shit out of me
[08:34] jesusabdullah: graeme_f: looks like some weirdo ide stuff
[08:34] benvie: this is the first time it parsed the whole thing and spat out a file
[08:34] benvie: and it looks mostly good
[08:34] jesusabdullah: graeme_f: I use the most basic text editor out there aside from nano
[08:35] benvie: but I'll need to get it cleaned up to be usable and fix the enums
[08:35] benvie: like 30k lines of code
[08:35] benvie: exploded out of my console
[08:35] devaholic: lol :D

[08:37] jesusabdullah: but I'm sure you could write something that fs.watchfiles, runs tests and reports on changes

[08:39] jesusabdullah: oh, y'know what's awesome though? Travis CI
[08:39] graeme_f: it's close but nowhere near as good :/
[08:39] jesusabdullah: because as soon as you commit it runs the tests
[08:39] devaholic: gedit ftw
[08:39] graeme_f: yeah i've been using travis too - amazing stuff :)
[08:39] jesusabdullah: and if you have both the travis-ci bot and the github bot running in your irc room
[08:39] graeme_f: ooh

[08:43] jesusabdullah: hahaha, nice
[08:44] jesusabdullah: I wouldn't mind tab-complete
[08:44] jesusabdullah: but that's about it
[08:44] graeme_f: ooh, tap does look nice
[08:44] devaholic: i usually meander between st2 and gedit
[08:44] jesusabdullah: yeah, tap is relatively straightforward which is nice
[08:44] graeme_f: hehe you must be a faster typist than me :)
[08:45] jesusabdullah: well, I've had a lot of practice
[08:45] jesusabdullah: been using irc since high school

[08:46] jesusabdullah: alternate theory: I think more slowly, so my typing doesn't have difficulty keeping up with my thoughts
[08:46] jesusabdullah: ;)
[08:46] graeme_f: hehe
[08:47] graeme_f: irc was invented while i was at high school, but we didn't have the internet back then :/
[08:47] jesusabdullah: ah
[08:47] graeme_f: interesting thought - maybe autocomplete has had a detremental effect on my typing speed :S
[08:48] jesusabdullah: irc and I are probably about the same age
[08:48] jesusabdullah: truth be told
[08:48] graeme_f: and possibly spelling ;)
[08:48] graeme_f: 1988
[08:48] jesusabdullah: Yeah
[08:48] jesusabdullah: I was born mid-87 so
[08:48] jesusabdullah: not much older n' irc
[08:49] graeme_f: :O
[08:49] graeme_f: right, better get to work :/
[08:50] jesusabdullah: haha
[08:50] graeme_f: well, better switch to visual studio,  not actually going to the office
[08:50] jesusabdullah: graeme_f: You're in Europe/England?

[10:07] tuhoojabotti: darrenlooby: I use mod_rewrite to proxy http to node.

[10:10] SubStack: I used passenger for that years ago
[10:10] c0smikdebris has joined the channel
[10:10] SubStack: but there's also https://github.com/substack/bouncy
[10:10] SubStack: super easy to set one of these proxies up
[10:10] tuhoojabotti: darrenlooby: RewriteRule ^(.*)$  http://server:port/$1 [P]
[10:11] tuhoojabotti: SubStack: I use bouncy too, when I need websockets.
[10:12] SubStack: tuhoojabotti: does that work when server:port isn't directly accessible to remote hosts?
[10:12] dilvie: what's cool about bouncy?
[10:13] dilvie: meaning: why would I want to use bouncy instead of other websocket libs?
[10:13] dilvie: btw, hi substack. =)
[10:13] tuhoojabotti: SubStack: Umm, yes, you can't access my node from the outside
[10:13] dilvie: <-- eric from RootMusic
[10:13] tuhoojabotti: except with that proxy
[10:13] SubStack: hoy
[10:13] SubStack: dilvie: bouncy is an http router, not a websocket lib
[10:14] SubStack: it's just not written so poorly that websockets don't work by default
[10:14] tuhoojabotti: ;)
[10:14] SubStack: as is the case with most proxies
[10:14] dilvie: I see. =)
[10:15] arnorhs has joined the channel
[10:15] darrenlooby: So, would it be a good idea to use bouncy - and not RewriteRule? Or, would I need both?

[13:05] yawNO: thought like "it cant be"

[13:08] arduix has joined the channel
[13:08] mAritz: :D
[13:08] aismail_ has left the channel
[13:09] mAritz: yeah, to be honest i actually read your mind and implemented it before you had any chance to do it
[13:09] yawNO: btw nice job
[13:09] mAritz: sadly then my time machine broke and i wasn't able to kill hitler
[13:09] mAritz: should've done it on the first run, as was suggested
[13:09] yawNO: to be honest i find its syntax a bit verbose
[13:09] mAritz: damnit
[13:09] yawNO: but apart from that.. i like it
[13:10] mAritz: yawNO: yeah, i know. i opted to not use getters/setters because they are (were?) pretty slow in v8
[13:10] yawNO: mAritz: how bout rewriting everything using proxies? they're implemented in C++ so should be pretty fast 
[13:10] mAritz: the whole relation mechanics isn't ideal either and i'm thinking about changing it for v1.0
[13:11] MartinCleaver: Any thoughts on the various node boilerplate choices on github? I see expressling, node-express-boilerplate & node-boilerplate - and that's without looking very hard
[13:11] unomi: mAritz: this looks pretty sexy
[13:11] mAritz: unomi: what does?
[13:11] mAritz: me? not right now. haven't showered yet.
[13:11] unomi: quick question though, the model schema definition, is that inherited from somewhere or?
[13:11] unomi: nohm
[13:11] unomi: om nohm nohm
[13:11] mAritz: oh, thanks :)
[13:12] crutex has joined the channel
[13:12] yawNO: okay i'll write my own Redis ORM
[13:12] yawNO: FLAME WAR FLAME WAR
[13:12] yawNO: just kidding :|
[13:12] mAritz: there's no inheritance of model schemas built in. but it should be trivial to do that on your end, i think
[13:13] mAritz: yawNO: there actually are a few
[13:13] unomi: I mean the syntax itself
[13:13] mAritz: yawNO: even tj had one at some point
[13:13] unomi: as in, why didn't you just use json-schema
[13:13] yawNO: i'm actually trying to find an alternative to Mongoos
[13:13] mAritz: unomi: you basically do pass json to nohm.model()?!
[13:13] yawNO: (i don't really care sticking to MongoDB.. eve though i like it a lot)
[13:13] yawNO: Mongoose is cool but there's some broken stuff in there
[13:14] yawNO: eg: not calling user-defined getters/setters on update
[13:14] unomi: mAritz: I am talking about the definition of the model
[13:14] mAritz: i'm gonna guess there is some broken stuff in nohm too. although i do have a lot of unit tests (sth like 400 assertions), it hasn't had a lot use real world use afaik.
[13:15] unomi: mAritz: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-03
[13:15] mAritz: unomi: hm, sorry, don't understand what you mean exactly. but i'm tired and have a hangover, so i'd go through as semi-retarded right now

[13:17] MartinCleaver: And then there is https://github.com/mauricemach/zappa
[13:17] zastaph: do I need to do sudo curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh ?
[13:17] unomi: zastaph: I would suggest going via nvm

[13:17] margle has joined the channel
[13:17] zastaph: ahh right
[13:17] yawNO: quick question
[13:17] yawNO: camelcase syntax or what?
[13:18] yawNO: i just cant choose.. but it would be cool if i could stick to the standard
[13:18] robi42 has joined the channel
[13:18] mAritz: yawNO: standard for what?
[13:18] Twelve-60 has joined the channel
[13:19] unomi: can't say that I am aware of a "standard" but I tend to use camelCase myself
[13:19] mAritz: zastaph: node v0.6.x upwards has npm included
[13:19] yawNO: mAritz: for node
[13:19] yawNO: what people usually choose?
[13:19] yawNO: camelcase or _ ?
[13:19] unomi: which people?
[13:19] yawNO: node community
[13:19] mmalecki: camelCase
[13:20] yawNO: good
[13:20] yawNO: let's stick with Perl then
[13:20] yawNO: :trollface:
[13:20] yawNO: i've got such a bad humor lol
[13:20] Industrial: yes.
[13:20] zastaph: maritz, I see.. but just typing npm doesn't launch it
[13:20] nibblebot has joined the channel
[13:21] unomi: yawNO: a good number of any given population do "it" wrong
[13:21] mAritz: i use camelCase for functions, CamelCase for constructors and normal_underscore for normal variables. although i'm not 100% strict, sadly xD
[13:21] unomi: and a good number of other people assume that they are probably doing it right and copy their behavior
[13:21] yawNO: unomi: so life sucks huh?
[13:21] sandfox has joined the channel
[13:22] unomi: yawNO: no, life is pretty interesting, if you are aware of it
[13:22] mAritz: zastaph: do you have v0.6.x? either way, using nvm should be fine. but if you're not using sudo to install it you'll have to somehow add npm/node to your PATH
[13:22] yawNO: well i'll just stick w/ camelcase.. but only because functions look better
[13:22] stef__ has joined the channel
[13:22] yawNO: but the ruby guys are pretty strict with that.. i got criticized because i used camelcase on class methods
[13:22] zastaph: maritz, I did the ubuntu part of github.com/node/wiki/installing-Node.js-via-package-manager
[13:23] mAritz: yawNO: i think there's a page on coding standards on github.com/joyent/node/wiki

[13:23] yawNO: unomi: i used to code Ruby.. before i found out i could use SSJS
[13:23] yawNO: :P
[13:24] yawNO: ruby is still a damn cool programming language, but i find js far more fun to work with
[13:24] unomi: Ruby was the first language I really fell in love with
[13:25] yawNO: yeah me too
[13:25] yawNO: then came javascript
[13:25] yawNO: and clojure
[13:25] yawNO: :3
[13:25] unomi: Still a bit miffed about how the Python vs Ruby ecosystem / popularity contest panned out

[13:29] yawNO: but nvm this is #nodejs
[13:29] unomi: I used to build desktop apps in Ruby and FOX
[13:29] mAritz: unomi: well, the main reason i didn't use that was obviously because i didn't know about it. not sure if there were prior versions, but if not i startet nohm 5 months before that spec was made public. :D
[13:29] yawNO: i don't really like desktop stuff
[13:30] yawNO: i'm more into web
[13:30] unomi: well, its rev3, my first exposure to it predates node.js
[13:31] mAritz: oh, ok
[13:31] unomi: yawNO: yeah, sure, this was a fairly long time ago
[13:31] yawNO: let's see how many things i broke

[13:36] arko_ has joined the channel

[15:42] Eruadan: with backbone, underscore. For the visual, jquery for menus and paper for some cool vector animation for the background, that's it
[15:43] unomi: I would also suggest, unless you already have something you can build on re backbone + underscore + jquery, something a bit more cohesive, like http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/app/app-todo.html

[15:46] mansoor has joined the channel
[15:46] unomi: you would probably also want to include socket.io in that mix
[15:46] unomi: and some localStorage functionality
[15:46] Eruadan: what socket.io would do?
[15:47] Eruadan: would make the magic of the products browsing?
[15:48] unomi: well, as I see it the next-gen apps will be all about the realtime web
[15:48] Eruadan: I've seen socket io example of chat, but i'm not quite confortable of what it can do
[15:48] Eruadan: all right
[15:49] Eruadan: bingo, so it's kinda of ajax
[15:49] unomi: you want to know who is on the same page as you, you want to give the store owner the ability to track behaviors with fine granularity, and perhaps even interact with them
[15:49] `3rdEden has joined the channel
[15:49] unomi: yeah, its kinda like ajax like ajax is kinda like loading a new page
[15:49] Eruadan: i see
[15:50] Eruadan: yeap, got it. So socket.io would make my idea to browse come true
[15:50] unomi: and more

[16:05] unomi: mansoor: because it is not worth doing?
[16:05] mansoor: unomi, explain
[16:05] mansoor: would you rather use something like nginx?
[16:06] unomi: what kind of file server are you talking about? just passing on static public files?
[16:06] mansoor: static file server
[16:06] unomi: I think most people do just that, yeah
[16:07] mansoor: Thats what I was thinking of... but then, I thought I didn't want to do the sys-admin stuff and go with nodejitsu platform... which is a pretty much node.js only platform unless i am deeply mistaken
[16:07] mansoor: (for hosting my app)
[16:07] unomi: there is also express  app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
[16:07] MartinCleaver: ^ true

[16:08] unomi: are you trying to serve static files?
[16:09] mansoor: I'm getting to that stage now, but yes
[16:09] justicefries: actually speaking of nginx and passing through static public files, is there a way to write out a sockfile and proxy_passing to that instead of the port?
[16:09] justicefries: well I'm sure there's a way
[16:09] justicefries: but in existence. :"D
[16:09] justicefries: s/"//
[16:10] unomi: mansoor: well, you could look at what express is doing under the hood for that
[16:10] mansoor: hmm  I was really hoping to avoid writing one myself
[16:11] unomi: mansoor: is your framework private and intended to not be OSS encumbered?
[16:11] justicefries: "designed my own framework" and "avoid writing one myself" I'd imagine are more exclusive than not.
[16:11] mansoor: unomi, it is opensource, but doesn't have tests :p
[16:11] ningu: I thought express was using connect.static
[16:11] mansoor: ningu, it does
[16:12] unomi: mansoor: then I don't really see the issue, express is released under MIT
[16:12] unomi: most likely that bit of functionality is not far from a drop-in
[16:12] mansoor: unomi, file server comes with connect, and even then its heavily  bound to the rest of connect
[16:13] mansoor: i mean... I can write one.. no problem i'd rather not :D

[18:55] TooTallNate: arturadib: are you trying to do 64-bit?
[18:55] arturadib: TooTallNate: not sure! how do I know that?
[18:56] arturadib: I just installed Node via the Nodejs.org installer, then MSVC++ express from the link you offer on the Node-Gyp page, then node-gyp configure, node-gyp build

[19:07] arkoi: Well, sorry for my dumb question but there is one thing I don't understand right now. We have this lovely event loop and one execution stack. Why is not possible to block the event loop while executing a callback?
[19:09] TooTallNate: arturadib: i just had to do that since 0.6.10 was the first version where i made isaacs upload the node.lib file

[22:03] arturadib: TooTallNate: had a question about .lib/.dll... apparently you build with the former, then deploy the latter (right?). anyway, node-gyp builds node-qt like a charm on windows!
[22:04] arturadib: (assuming non-static linking)
[22:04] arturadib: I'll just have to bundle both .libs and .dlls
[22:05] TooTallNate: arturadib: glad to hear it works :)
[22:05] TooTallNate: usually you would static link any dependencies
[22:05] TooTallNate: but that's really up to you
[22:05] TooTallNate: i haven't tried linking to any dlls though
[22:05] TooTallNate: but the resulting .node file is essentialy a .dll file
[22:06] TooTallNate: but what now about bundling both lib and dll?
[22:06] TooTallNate: when i statically compile libffi into node-ffi's .node file, i only need to distribute that
[22:07] merlin83 has joined the channel
[22:07] arturadib: yeah, it's really tough to statically compile against Qt, starting with the several hours it takes to build Qt itself statically
[22:08] TooTallNate: ya so you might be better off distributing the compiled .dll file along with the .node file
[22:08] TooTallNate: just like OS X

[22:35] zastaph: and i get the same error with cannot find module

[22:40] TooTallNate: i think
[22:40] zastaph: TooTallNate, that's the thing.. this specific purpose (of creating a html out of only a css) i've googled 100 times and only came up with this
