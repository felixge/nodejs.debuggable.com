[00:01] freewil: ill try to return the favor
[00:02] hermanjunge has joined the channel
[00:02] hermanjunge: Hi, Mongo hackers, anywhere?
[00:03] hermanjunge: just one question: How do I dump all data?
[00:03] shanebo: freewil, since my app code is consistent but my requests are unique, I'm looking for a way to access app level code without passing the entire app into each controller instance
[00:03] hermanjunge: first, is a fresh database
[00:03] hermanjunge: second, A command to show me everything I have in the database at the moment
[00:03] saikat has joined the channel
[00:03] hermanjunge: like mysqldump >db.txt; but in mongo
[00:03] hermanjunge: ...
[00:04] Dmitrijus: hermanjunge: there is a mongodump utility
[00:05] Dmitrijus: hermanjunge: just read the docs, they are, quite awesome
[00:05] shanebo: freewil, does my question make sense?
[00:05] freewil: shanebo, so you're trying to avoid something like new Controller(app); ?
[00:05] shanebo: exactly
[00:05] freewil: are you using express?
[00:06] shanebo: because i don't want to store all that code in each request
[00:06] shanebo: i'm using connect
[00:06] eirikb: shanebo: But if you use require from that module it should go back to the app anyway?
[00:06] shanebo: and rolled my own MVC-ish framework
[00:06] hermanjunge: yep
[00:06] hermanjunge: I've just saw the documents
[00:06] mynyml has joined the channel
[00:06] hermanjunge: they're "project-manager" proof
[00:06] hermanjunge: :D
[00:06] hermanjunge: Thanks Dmitrijus
[00:06] davidascher has joined the channel
[00:07] shanebo: eirikb, I'm not understanding your point
[00:07] eirikb: shanebo: If you run require('./app.js') from whereever (with correct path) it should reach the app
[00:07] Dmitrijus: hermanjunge: np, mongodb and node is the killer combination anyway ;)
[00:08] hermanjunge: Dmitrijus, I just made a dump, how can I JSON-fy-it?
[00:08] hermanjunge: say take myFile.bson and JSON-it
[00:08] shanebo: eirikb, right but not the instance of the app
[00:08] eirikb: shanebo: Yes
[00:08] freewil: shanebo, why not just pass the object in to the controller?
[00:09] Dmitrijus: hermanjunge: why would you want to do this? bson and json are not _very_ compatable
[00:09] DTrejo has joined the channel
[00:09] hermanjunge: to read my dump
[00:09] shanebo: because I'm loading all views, layouts, and partials and storing them in the app object
[00:09] hermanjunge: to see what have I been writing into the db
[00:09] shanebo: it doesn't feel DRY passing all that into every single request
[00:09] eirikb: shanebo: Why wouldn't require give you the instance?
[00:11] freewil: i believe it would give you access to the class
[00:11] Dmitrijus: hermanjunge: okay, so, i would just do the find() in the shell instead of dumping, but there is bsondump utility
[00:11] freewil: but not the instance of the class
[00:11] shanebo: right, that's what I'm thinking freewil
[00:11] Dmitrijus: hermanjunge: it dump bson to json :)
[00:11] eirikb: shanebo: tias
[00:11] freewil: eirikb, who?
[00:12] eirikb: Try it and see
[00:12] Dmitrijus: hermanjunge: dumps*
[00:12] freewil: yeah im not exactly sure because i dont think you explicitly use new() with connect
[00:13] hermanjunge: ok!
[00:13] skm has joined the channel
[00:13] shanebo: i'm using mootools pseudo classes, so I am using new on my framework, but not on connect itself

[00:15] brianseeders has joined the channel
[00:15] freewil: shanebo, i dont see any other way to do it but pass it to app object to the controller
[00:15] freewil: and i dont see anything wrong with that either
[00:15] shanebo: i presume node's garbage collection is good
[00:16] freewil: shanebo, passing an objects around in js are done by ref
[00:16] freewil: so it shouldnt take up anymore memory
[00:17] shanebo: rreally?
[00:18] shanebo: so if I pass my object into my controller and assign the views, layouts and partials in my controller, that's not adding anything, only referencing?
[00:18] freewil: well you'll be adding that to the app object
[00:18] freewil: but you wont be making a copy of the app object
[00:19] freewil: but why assign all that to the app object?
[00:19] shanebo: maybe explaining how my framework works, would help :D

[00:24] shanebo: does node know what file is requiring the instance?
[00:25] shanebo: in other words, is there node magic know what instance belongs to the file that is requiring?
[00:26] freewil: shanebo, in that gist example i is defined globally within the module
[00:26] freewil: so the i would be shared across all code that requires test.js

[04:53] chovy: xerox: that didn't upgrade it, it still says 1.0.247

[04:53] chovy: but github has 1.0.30 as the latest.
[04:54] xerox: â”œâ”€â”¬ npm@1.0.30 
[04:54] xerox: gives me 1.0.30

[05:04] Daegalus: thats what I've used for my other projects, and I like it too. Just wanting to see various opinions on this. I like hearing opinions of other devs to help me with my choice
[05:04] chovy: npm update npm -g does nothing.
[05:04] Daegalus: chovy: I was looking at mongoose, at first it seemed simple, but as I scrolled down the page for examples, it seemed to get overly complicated fast
[05:04] fangel has joined the channel
[05:05] xerox: I hit a lot of walls in mongoose but well it might work for some things
[05:05] chovy: Daegalus: from what I read it was supposed to provide an easy interface over mongodb-native.
[05:05] xerox: one of the hugest problems for me was that validation of unrelated fields kicked in when I was updating a subset of the object properties that did not require validation
[05:06] Daegalus: Hmm, that could be a bummer, i dont need validation. I just need to manipulate lots of data, quickly, easily, but with a tight structure
[05:07] Daegalus: though I am going to be using mongos GeoSpatial tools to filter data size
[05:07] chovy: xerox: https://gist.github.com/b998dedf0b345b9ad865
[05:09] xerox: chovy: since you have nothing else

[05:13] Daegalus: IM just scoping things because Node is developing so fast, tis hard to keep up with all the libraries popping up
[05:13] chovy: Daegalus: i don't like jade. ejs is better imo.
[05:13] tmzt_: jade is awesome, that is all

[05:14] v8bot_:  Daegalus has given a beer to chjj. chjj now has 6 beers.
[05:14] tmzt_: but I mostly just hand translate it to jade when i can, I find a few find/replace and delets does the trick
[05:14] Bonuspunkt has joined the channel
[05:14] Daegalus: tmzt_: isnt there a HTML2Jade converter i saw somwehere?
[05:14] tmzt_: never looked
[05:14] tmzt_: never had that much to translate
[05:15] Jabbers: https://github.com/donpark/html2jade
[05:15] tmzt_: jade lets' you think about the selectors and the structure of the page, doing it by hand is better
[05:15] Daegalus: chovy: because I am tired of writing HTML, CSS is fine, i can write that, but I really am getting tired of the SGML languages. Like XML, HTML, etc. Tired of the tags and such
[05:15] tmzt_: you find things you didn't need or were there solely for presentation
[05:15] dreamdust has joined the channel
[05:16] Daegalus: ill stick to jade then
[05:16] xerox: I like jade a lot because it's super light weight
[05:16] Daegalus: maybe even hop on some Stylus or LESS
[05:16] xerox: different people expect different things from a tempting language though, soâ€¦
[05:17] Jabbers: jade + stylus = :cheese:
[05:17] tmzt_: best part of jade is the conditionals and built in js is so clean
[05:17] Daegalus: no, Jade is great, im just making sure im keeping up on all the good libraries atm.
[05:18] chovy: Daegalus: i like html.
[05:19] Daegalus: chovy: too cubersome, ive been spoiled by programming languages being clean, and JSON, so now I look at XML and HTML and want to barf
[05:20] chovy: i hear ya. I just figure why abstract it.
[05:20] chovy: html5 doesn't need quotes.
[05:20] lynxnathan: if you ask me, html seems cleaner than javascript ("by the looks")
[05:20] chjj: both points are valid, but just be happy xhtml died
[05:21] chovy: heh
[05:21] Navarr: xhtml isn't dead :(
[05:21] chjj: we would be using xml on the web, and that would not be fun
[05:21] chovy: the best thing about html5 is the doctype.
[05:21] chjj: yes, its dead
[05:21] Navarr: chjj: xhtml lives on in the HTML5 spec
[05:21] chjj: thoroughly dead
[05:21] chjj: ha!
[05:21] Daegalus: omg yes, HTML5 doctype so much cleaner
[05:21] chjj: not even close
[05:21] Daegalus: <!DOCTYPE html>
[05:21] Daegalus: done!
[05:22] Navarr: chjj: how can you call it dead? D:
[05:22] chovy: and you can code like this: <p class=foo>
[05:22] chjj: Navarr: because it is dead
[05:22] Navarr: chjj: Ohhh, you must be the president of the tautology club
[05:22] chovy: nobody uses xhtml anymore, except on existing sites.
[05:22] chjj: Navarr: how can you call it alive?
[05:22] Navarr: chovy: I use XHTML =p
[05:22] chjj: Navarr: show me one person who actually uses xhtml, theres only a handful of them
[05:23] chovy: i meant for newer sites, they should be using html5.
[05:23] Navarr: whats wrong with XHTML5?
[05:23] Daegalus: it doesnt exist?
[05:23] chjj: very very very very few people use xhtml
[05:23] xerox: haha
[05:23] Navarr: Last i checked, HTML5 allows for XHTML5 in the spec
[05:23] chjj: a lot of people *think* theyre using xhtml, but dont bother serving it with the proper mime type
[05:23] chjj: so its not xhtml
[05:24] chjj: its just bad html
[05:24] jedahan has joined the channel
[05:24] chovy: well, when i used xhtml, i usually used an html4 doctype.
[05:24] Navarr: chjj: True.  But at least they're trying to write stricter code
[05:24] chjj: Navarr: that has nothing to do with whether xhtml is alive or not, its funny you reference html5, which is essentially the thing that picked up the pieces after the monumental failure of xhtml
[05:24] chovy: that was a good thing about xhtml, it taught people to write valid and well-formed html.
[05:25] Navarr: chjj: The monumental failure being that nobody wanted the vast changes coming in XHTML2?
[05:25] chjj: Navarr: ask yourself, why is strict good? its only strict in terms of xml, why is xml good? why isnt writing good html enough?
[05:26] Navarr: chjj: Why should you use braces and semicolons in JavaScript?
[05:26] chjj: first of all, its conceivable to not use semicolons at all
[05:26] Navarr: chjj: Its horrible coding to do so
[05:26] chovy: Navarr: agreed.
[05:26] chjj: and my response was, "why is writing *good* html not enough?"
[05:26] Daegalus: Unless you use Python
[05:26] Navarr: XHTML brought sanity to the mess that HTML-soup is
[05:26] chjj: Navarr: alright, dont bother using npm then
[05:26] Daegalus: <3 python, no wated time typing braces, semicolons, and other crap
[05:27] chjj: Navarr: written entirely without semicolons
[05:27] Navarr: chjj: In JavaScript?
[05:27] chjj: Navarr: yessir
[05:27] Navarr: chjj: Crazy author.
[05:27] Navarr: One who must've fully understood how JavaScript works
[05:27] chjj: Navarr: maybe you should learn to think for yourself instead of blindly listening to crockford
[05:27] Navarr: who is crockford?
[05:27] chovy: in my experience, at companies where lots of people work on the code, the tabbing requirements would be a nightmare if the code didn't run properly if tabs were f--d up.
[05:27] chjj: possibly read the ecma spec, learn what a js statement is while youre at it
[05:28] chovy: nobody can agree on spaces or tabs, and so you get blocks that are all messed up.
[05:28] Daegalus: https://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/npm.js no semicolons
[05:28] chjj: thats an entirely different issue though
[05:28] dingomanatee: <-- a big fan of the spab
[05:28] Daegalus: spab?
[05:28] cognominal___ has joined the channel
[05:29] dingomanatee: a four character wide space.
[05:29] chjj: Navarr: the fact is, xhtml was completely backwards, it didnt spec graceful error handling, it relied on a *stupid* xml parser, it didnt support incremental rendering, it muddied up the entire situation with horribly designed namespaces
[05:29] chjj: Navarr: it had no place on the web, im glad its dead
[05:29] Navarr: Aww, I'm hurt.  I liked XML namespaces.  
[05:29] Navarr: the idea of being able to integrate different technologies in your HTML was an interesting one
[05:30] chjj: Navarr: furthermore, xhtml2 broke backward compatibility so damn bad, it basically sealed its own fate
[05:30] Daegalus: i personally hate XML with a passion, and hope JSON soon kills it for most general uses
[05:30] chjj: xml is terrible, its useful for very few things
[05:30] dingomanatee: a noble ambition but there is still a lot of legacy web service work and APIs that lean on XML
[05:30] chjj: Navarr: why isnt that possible with html?
[05:30] Navarr: xml shouldn't be used as a data-transfer language.  It was designed as a markup language.  Comparing it to JSON is comparing apples and oranges, to be true
[05:30] dingomanatee: for instance, HTML
[05:30] chjj: Navarr: inline svg was ported to html for example
[05:31] Navarr: chjj: It was ported, yes.  As all technologies have to be.  XML just allows for them
[05:31] dmkbot: joyent/libuv: 03erickt: start unifying windows and unix bind and connect code - https://github.com/joyent/libuv/issues/205
[05:31] chjj: Navarr: it only allows for them if the clients implement it
[05:31] dingomanatee: I never had a problem comparing apples to oranges. 
[05:31] chjj: Navarr: simply saying it allows it doesnt make it so in the real world
[05:31] dingomanatee: They are quite similar. 
[05:31] Navarr: nor does HTML, chjj.  Video is an easy example
[05:32] chjj: Navarr: also, xbl2/whatever-its-renamed-to was also ported to html

[05:32] chjj: yes
[05:32] chjj: read the spec
[05:32] Daegalus: Navarr: im comparing it because it IS used as a data-transfer language and it bugs me. 
[05:32] Navarr: chjj: In my defense its a very long spec =p
[05:32] Navarr: Daegalus: Trufax.
[05:33] chjj: Navarr: i used to spend a lot of time with this stuff before i got permanently distracted by the world of node
[05:33] chjj: i went from an xhtml advocate, to an xhtml hater, to an xml hater
[05:34] Navarr: I can see the appeal of HTML5, but not a reason to hate XML.
[05:34] chjj: i hate xml for other reasons
[05:34] chjj: not in comparison to something else

[05:35] Daegalus: hmmm, I havnet been paying too much attention, but does HTML5 allow for custom fonts that render properly even if the clients system doesnt have it?
[05:35] cognominal___ has joined the channel
[05:35] chjj: its just xhtml made me see the real problem, xml - what a horrible little language
[05:35] dreamdust has joined the channel
[05:35] Navarr: Daegalus: CSS does
[05:35] chjj: and it actually necesitates the *dumbest* parser
[05:35] dingomanatee: you like tit then as what, an abstract art form?
[05:35] chjj: the most unsophisticated parser you could imagine
[05:35] Daegalus: Navarr: CSS3?
[05:36] Navarr: Daegalus: Possibly CSS2
[05:36] user1_: where can i get a simple login authentication with db like mongodb for nodejs
[05:36] Daegalus: now, Ive never see CSS2 custom fonts. and i just googled it, its a CSS3 @font-face directive
[05:36] dingomanatee: Everything done for the first time ends up with unpleasant consequences. 
[05:36] chjj: Daegalus: font-face has been supported in IE since IE4
[05:37] chjj: it was a proposal a long time back, its just no one wanted to implement it
[05:37] cognominal___ has joined the channel
[05:37] wookiehangover has left the channel
[05:37] dingomanatee: I think its fair to say that the impulse behind XML was a good one - human readable annotated hierarchical data. 
[05:37] Daegalus: chjj: Not exactly a feature which is new to CSS3, @font-face was first proposed for CSS2 and has been implemented in Internet Explorer since version 5! However, their implementation relied on the proprietary Embedded Open Type (.eot) format, and no other browsers decided to use this format. With the release of Safari 3.1, however, website makers can use any licensed TrueType (.ttf) or OpenType (.otf) font in their pages.
[05:37] chjj: version 5, roger

[05:40] chovy: https://github.com/bnoguchi/everyauth
[05:40] chjj: anyway, googles free web fonts are pretty nice to use, they probably have a ton more since the last time i looked at them
[05:41] Navarr: chjj: SO MANY FONTS
[05:41] Daegalus: chjj: ill just use something like Corbel, Candara, or something. Until I get a C&D from Microsoft, Ill use them on my site
[05:42] chjj: Navarr: on the semicolon thing, personally, i use semicolons because i like js to look more like c
[05:42] chjj: Navarr: but theres nothing wrong with not using semicolons
[05:42] user1_: chovy : links with simple examples of authentication?
[05:43] chjj: Navarr: as long as you understand the implications
[05:43] chovy: http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface
[05:43] Navarr: chjj: chjj: I can't argue with that
[05:44] Daegalus: chovy: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corbel_(typeface) ill jus tuse that :P
[05:44] Daegalus: the other fonts in teh family/pack are good too
[05:45] sdwrage has left the channel
[05:45] chovy: the problem with custom fonts is they are large, and take time to d/l
[05:46] Daegalus: Corbel & Candara for Sans-serif, Constantina for Serif, and Consolas for Monospace
[05:46] Daegalus: chovy: eh, Ill find a way to compress them or something
[05:46] chovy: they are still large. 
[05:47] Navarr: Especially one's not made for embedding
[05:47] Daegalus: ehhhh, Constantia, 400kb for regular, bold, italic, and whatever Z stands for
[05:48] Daegalus: bold italic
[05:48] chovy: they're cool, but it can kill the experience with the font-flash.
[05:48] Daegalus: font-flash/
[05:48] Daegalus: ?
[05:48] Navarr: when its one font and then changes to another upon download
[05:49] chovy: Daegalus: it can block text from rendering in some browsers, and at times it will flash unstyled text first, then re-render it once the file is downloaded.
[05:50] zeade has joined the channel
[05:50] Daegalus: eh I guess, but with how heavy sites are now, with insane amounts of images, and other junk, im still not too worried. Plus, I can always make JS pre-load the file before rendering the text
[05:50] Navarr: chovy: I wonder if a SPDY hack would allow the download of used fonts first? :p
[05:51] chovy: Daegalus: there's also mobile. Slower connections, not as many simultaneous requests.
[05:51] Daegalus: chovy: for mobile, I will make a mobile template and use proper fonting.
[05:52] chovy: Navarr: the other problem is it downloads all fonts defined in the css, not just the ones you use on the page.
[05:53] chovy: We ended up removing custom fonts from our homepage.
[05:54] Wa has joined the channel
[05:54] Daegalus: chovy: wouldn after the first load, it would cache them?
[05:55] chovy: Daegalus: yes
[05:55] Daegalus: sooo unless its the first load, font-flash wont happen?
[05:56] chovy: the css is still loaded on the homepage, but we didn't want to block things like autosuggest (it was unusable until the font loaded) and avoid the font-flash on the homepage.
[05:59] Daegalus: chovy: have you guys tried compression? there are a bunch of ways to do it through Apache or .htaccess to compress the fonts
[05:59] ticean_ has joined the channel
[05:59] dshaw_ has joined the channel
[05:59] chovy: Daegalus: that's one thing I just did.
[05:59] chovy: gave us a 45% savings.
[06:00] Daegalus: whats hte size of teh fonts you are using?
[06:00] chovy: I have not yet tested the homepage w/ compression enabled. I'm pretty sure it'll still be too many bytes though.
[06:00] Daegalus: wow typos
[06:00] meso has joined the channel
[06:00] Daegalus: well i mean the original size of your font
[06:01] chovy: we had one font-face, but several fonts for it. italic, bold, varying sizes, etc.
[06:01] chovy: i forget the amount.
[06:01] tmzt_: remove unused glyphs
[06:01] tmzt_: right

[06:05] jocafa has left the channel
[06:05] chovy: tmzt_: yeah. we thought of that too.
[06:06] chovy: total was about 200k i think.
[06:06] tmzt_: anybody seen/used/heard about cufon.js for adapting fonts for older browsers?
[06:06] chovy: the best is to limit to 1 custom font, compress it, and removed unused glyphs.
[06:07] chovy: tmzt_: how old?
[06:07] chovy: there is a method for IE i think.

[06:09] Daegalus: seems TTF/OTF are the best bet
[06:09] Daegalus: with WOFF coming in second
[06:10] dreamdust has joined the channel
[06:11] chovy: TTF - Works in most browsers except IE and iPhone.
[06:11] chovy: EOT - IE only.
[06:11] chovy: WOFF - Compressed, emerging standard.
[06:11] chovy: SVG - iPhone/iPad.
[06:11] Daegalus: chovy: iphone/ipad support TTF/OTF in 4.2+
[06:11] tmzt_: https://github.com/sorccu/cufon/wiki/about

[06:12] tmzt_: json to canvas rendering of text for every individual glyph???
[06:12] nerdy has joined the channel
[06:13] tmzt_: and it starts as otf, so they could just embed the otf for browsers that need it (pretty sure the font is standard in windows anyway)

[11:47] DennisRasmussen has joined the channel
[11:48] Brandon_R: i have a question
[11:48] Brandon_R: is it possible to have node.js events on the browser
[11:48] Brandon_R: is there like an event emitter or something
[11:48] SubStack: Brandon_R: there is if you use browserify
[11:48] akter has joined the channel
[11:49] ixti has joined the channel
[11:49] SubStack: then you can just var EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter
[11:49] Brandon_R: is it recommended to write evented code on the browser?
[11:49] Brandon_R: like one would do in node.js
[11:49] SubStack: I do it all the time
[11:50] xerox: the dom does make you write event based code anyway :)
[11:50] Brandon_R: oh
[11:51] Brandon_R: so no need for an addon to write evented code?
[11:51] djko: Javascript is already even oriented
[11:51] Brandon_R: any examples? like how to iterate over each li list and capatilize all the entires asyncronously or evented.
[11:52] akter has joined the channel
[11:52] djko: probably some wrapper will be needed to use same way node/browser
[11:52] Brandon_R: i think async does it
[11:52] igl1: there is jsdom
[11:52] Brandon_R: have you tried it?
[11:52] igl1: but its silly
[11:52] igl1: why would you want a dom?
[11:52] igl1: use json
[11:52] igl1: not html strings
[11:53] DrMcKay: Brandon_R: or EventEmitter2, it's already compatible with browser
[11:53] DrMcKay: btw, just wondering
[11:53] Brandon_R: i'll check it out
[11:54] DrMcKay: how faster would it be for a browser to fetch things like stylesheets, scripts, etc. if they came in HTTP headers?
[11:54] DrMcKay: we could have, say, a cache server analysing dependencies
[11:55] DrMcKay: and setting some header, like X-Preload: /static/stylesheet.css
[11:55] clabrie has joined the channel

[12:01] Brandon_R: are you familar with caolan async drmckay?
[12:01] DrMcKay: Brandon_R: yup
[12:01] DrMcKay: it's pretty kickass
[12:01] Brandon_R: kool i have a question about nextick
[12:01] Brandon_R: in the browser environment
[12:02] DrMcKay: I don't think that browser provides nextTick
[12:02] DrMcKay: SubStack: does browserify...?
[12:02] Brandon_R: async works on the browser by using settimeout(callback, 0) or process.nexttick in node
[12:03] Ginlock has joined the channel
[12:03] Brandon_R: how different are the two?
[12:03] DrMcKay: ah, I see
[12:03] SubStack: DrMcKay: you can just do a setTimeout(fn, 0) and it's pretty close
[12:03] DrMcKay: I didn't read async code
[12:03] DrMcKay: yeah, I see it here: https://github.com/caolan/async/blob/master/lib/async.js#L82
[12:04] andrewfff has joined the channel
[12:04] Ned_ has joined the channel
[12:04] DrMcKay: Brandon_R: in node, process.nextTick is faster than setTimeout(fn, 0)
[12:04] zastaph has joined the channel
[12:04] Brandon_R: i see
[12:05] DrMcKay: Brandon_R: but in browser, only thing you have is setTimeout(fn, 0)
[12:05] DrMcKay: ACTION goes to benchmark it in node
[12:05] zakuni has joined the channel
[12:05] Brandon_R: lemme know how the benchmark goes
[12:06] xerox: you also have https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Creating_and_triggering_events
[12:06] djko: process.nextick is emulation. It is created on base of c++ open source library
[12:06] xerox: not just setTimeout
[12:06] djko: it's just infinite loop
[12:07] felixge has joined the channel
[12:07] felixge has joined the channel
[12:07] Brandon_R: oh cool, so i don't need a library to have events on the browser
[12:07] Brandon_R: nice
[12:07] xerox: indeed
[12:08] DrMcKay: haha
[12:08] neurodrone has joined the channel
[12:08] DrMcKay: yeah, nextTick is way faster
[12:08] Brandon_R: is it advisible to code in events like i do on node in the browser though?
[12:08] djko: if you want to make those crossbrowser - you need
[12:09] Brandon_R: is createevent cross browser?
[12:10] Brandon_R: ewe no     if (document.createEventObject){     // dispatch for IE     var evt = document.createEventObject();     return element.fireEvent('on'+event,evt)     }     else{     // dispatch for firefox + others 
[12:11] zakuni_ has joined the channel
[12:11] xerox: if browsers really suck one could use http://api.jquery.com/trigger/ I guess
[12:12] xerox: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOM_events#Event_object  :(
[12:13] djko: yeah, for custom event use one of libraries
[12:13] DrMcKay: https://gist.github.com/1257394
[12:14] DrMcKay: those are the results ^
[12:14] djko: jQuery, YUI, Ext.js etc
[12:15] djko: DrMcKay: i am not sure about node but in browser setTimout minimum timeout is ~15ms
[12:16] djko: i.e. even if you place 0 that would be 15ms
[12:16] level09 has joined the channel
[12:16] DrMcKay: djko: yeah, possibly. I just wanted to show Brandon_R what's the difference

[13:51] japj: DrMcKay: and after 1.0, there will be a 1.2 at some point aswell

[13:54] chance-: so that's a tradeoff
[13:54] olivvv:  git pull  git://github.com/joyent/node.git
[13:54] japj: DrMcKay: anyway, in a way 1.0 is important from a 'marketing p.o.v.', as it will probably increase interest
[13:54] olivvv: >> You asked to pull from the remote 'git://github.com/joyent/node.git', but did not specify
[13:54] olivvv: a branch. Because this is not the default configured remote
[13:54] olivvv: for your current branch, you must specify a branch on the command line.

[14:38] d-snp: hi, http://pastie.org/2626992 <-- for some reason, after the first call to configure, this.shards becomes undefined
[14:38] d-snp: oh wait.. 
[14:38] d-snp: lol, why do I think about it for half an hour and think of nothing
[14:38] d-snp: and then I finally decide to paste it here, and realize it might be because this gets bound to something random because configure is called by fsWatchFile..
[14:40] japj: d-snp: is shardsChanged called when you call configure?
[14:40] d-snp: yes
[14:41] d-snp: the very first time I call it from initialize of the object
[14:41] d-snp: but after that it gets called by the file watcher

[14:49] AvianFlu: japj ===
[14:49] AvianFlu: here's the difference
[14:49] AvianFlu: == will do type coercion
[14:49] AvianFlu: so 3 == '3'
[14:49] AvianFlu: but 3 === '3' is false
[14:49] AvianFlu: because === is "equal in value and type"

[15:24] olivvv: well I have updated to the latest i think
[15:25] japj: 0.5.x is the current development version of node, it could be that socket.io is not updated to work with it yet (require.paths was removed in 0.5.2 I think)

[15:30] cafesofie has joined the channel
[15:30] japj: you need a stable (even == 0.4.x) version if you depend on (certain) other modules. some of the modules are not ported to 0.5.x yet, so to have the least amount of 'problems' it is probably better to use the latest 0.4.x
[15:31] AvianFlu: olivvv, 0.4.12 is latest stable
[15:32] AvianFlu: olivvv, if nobody has told you, node uses UNIX versioning - when the biggest number is even, it's stable, and when it's odd, it's a development/unstable version
[15:32] AvianFlu: that will probably hold for minor versions in general, now that I think about it
[15:32] japj: olivvv: if you want to try out node itself, it is better to use 0.4.12. if you want to work on node itself then you might want to use the current 'development' version
[15:32] AvianFlu: so in x.y.z, I'm talking about y
[15:33] olivvv: how to get the right branch ?  git pull  git://github.com/joyent/node.git v0.4

[16:43] AvianFlu: does curl support oauth?
[16:43] AvianFlu: cause that might just be an old example
[16:44] Trisox[work] has joined the channel
[16:44] skript: no, but the example works
[16:44] skript: which i found quite odd
[16:44] skript: i just had to sign in with my username and password
[16:44] skript: they are using a file called location, but that is not idea in my situation. is there a way to just include those boundaries in my filter call
[16:44] AvianFlu: I *thought* that they'd turned off all their basic auth
[16:44] skript: try it
[16:44] skript: i just did
[16:44] AvianFlu: skript there is, but I think it will take a patch

[16:46] skript: are you talking about for trying to use a file with bounding boxes inside of it?
[16:47] skript: the streaming api's documentation is less than ideal
[16:47] AvianFlu: skript: you can add that stuff as a string literal in your options, I think
[16:47] skript: that would be the best
[16:47] AvianFlu: {track: [], location: 'that location stuff as a string'}
[16:48] AvianFlu: that *should* work
[16:48] AvianFlu: if not, I'll need to patch it
[16:48] AvianFlu: you can leave off the track part, I just put it there for reference

[17:20] luke` has joined the channel
[17:20] TheJH: Brandon_R, pong
[17:20] japj: ping
[17:21] Brandon_R: one quick question about nginx again. Should all traffic pass through it or just traffic for static files?
[17:21] TheJH: japj, you didn't specify a ping target
[17:21] Brandon_R: like socket.io requests or websockets etc
[17:22] TheJH: Brandon_R, it'd be good if only static file trafic would go to nginx, I think - as far as I know, nginx can't forward websockets
[17:22] japj: does a target come before or after the pong?
[17:22] TheJH: japj, :D
[17:22] Brandon_R: that would be the logical conclusion. Thanks Bud

[19:13] tbranyen: quick cpu computations and defering long running operations to a separate thread that calls back to the event loop?
[19:13] pvgrif: so say my application takes very long in fetching data from urls
[19:13] pvgrif: but the request is limited to 30 seconds
[19:13] pvgrif: so the client has to poll the server for updates and i need kind of a background job to do the fetching

[20:08] chance-: but then again, maybe not
[20:08] levi: They've got various maturity levels, but postgres has been the core storage for LOTS of big systems for many years, which is the sort of maturity he's talking about.  People know how it behaves.

[20:46] pquerna: correct, android doens't use glibc
[20:46] levi: You should be able to copy the libs over with it, though.
[20:46] pquerna: this is really a path of pain

[20:48] eboyjr: I get ReferenceError: require is not defined
[20:48] eboyjr: It doesn't make sense
[20:50] TheJH: pquerna, thanks
[20:51] eboyjr: Oh the problem is process.argv[1] is the current file :/

[20:54] DrMcKay: TheJH: mine compiled without any problem
[20:54] TheJH: DrMcKay, I want it to work on my android phone, and that is a ARM, not a x86
[20:55] DrMcKay: yes.
[20:55] DrMcKay: I've compiled mine on my phone, under Fedora chroot

[20:56] yacoob: ACTION has a naive question. Why would I want to use node.js?
[20:57] TheJH: DrMcKay, is your phone an android?
[20:57] DrMcKay: TheJH: yes
[20:57] DrMcKay: TheJH: HTC Desire HD
[20:57] DrMcKay: yacoob: non-blocking I/O?
[20:57] DrMcKay: yacoob: or maybe: what do you want to use node for?
[20:58] levi: yacoob: Because you want to write server-side software with javascript in the same callback style with which you write browser-side javascript?
[20:58] levi: And you want it to be easy to deploy and relatively fast?
[20:58] TheJH: DrMcKay, "but I doubt it would work outside this chroot" => so you're using chroot on the android?
[20:58] yacoob: DrMcKay, I don't think I have a particular need, I just wanted to look at what it is - and I found it perplexing.
[20:59] DrMcKay: yacoob: why?
[20:59] DrMcKay: TheJH: yes
[20:59] DrMcKay: TheJH: there's a nice blog post about it, I'll look it up in a sec
[20:59] TheJH: DrMcKay, oh, cool, busybox has chroot... can you give me a link to a tarball with your chroot?
[21:00] yacoob: DrMcKay, probably because I'm not a fan of JS. And I'd rather see the oposite, js getting eradicated in favor of something else. And I can understand how people who like JS would like to see it being used away from the browser.
[21:00] levi: yacoob: If you don't like JS, you probably don't want node.js.
[21:00] TheJH: yacoob, but you can't force other stuff on the browser. however, you can use JS on the server
[21:00] elpinguino has joined the channel
[21:01] yacoob: levi, I doubt I'd use it, yes. But I wanted to know what is it good for, and why is it a popular topic.
[21:02] levi: It's popular because a whole lot of people know and kind of like javascript, and it lets you easily whip together a little web app with it.
[21:02] yacoob: probably :)
[21:02] levi: And also it got picked up by the 'cool' web dev crowd.
[21:02] TheJH: and now it has a bunch of cool people working on it
[21:03] TheJH: s/on/on and with/

[21:03] rburhum has joined the channel
[21:03] levi: I'm not crazy about javascript (though I don't dislike it particularly) but node.js hit a sweet spot with ease of development, ease of deploying, a nice package management system, and a lot of nice support libraries you can easily grab.
[21:04] yacoob: levi, so see, for me 'bottle.py' is the optimum for your function. :)
[21:04] socketio\test\14 has joined the channel
[21:04] softdrink has joined the channel
[21:05] levi: yacoob: Are you interested in learning about node.js, or just trying to get people to accept your dislike of it?
[21:06] TomY has joined the channel
[21:07] skript: AvianFlu: ping
[21:07] yacoob: levi, I'm genuinely interested in seeing why is it popular. I think I know now. I'm not sure whether I want to learn more about it.
[21:07] yacoob: I'd most certainly like to see that networking api in browser implementations of JS, but that's not happening.
[21:07] yacoob: (well - not in short term)
[21:07] levi: bottle.py looks pretty nice, but it's not exactly on topic here.
[21:08] FIQ has joined the channel
[21:08] yacoob: hence, I'm not mentioning it any more.
[21:08] DrMcKay: yacoob: probably because of fragmentation in other projects of asynchronous frameworks
[21:08] DrMcKay: yacoob: for example, Tornado
[21:08] DrMcKay: yacoob: it's a very tiny subpart of Python community
[21:09] levi: I don't actually like the 'everything uses callbacks' api, but it's what node.js is, and the ecosystem generally makes up for it.
[21:09] AvianFlu: skript: try ntwitter@0.2.5
[21:09] rburhum has left the channel
[21:09] DrMcKay: yacoob: so, when you want a library to do *something* in Tornado, you likely won't find it
[21:09] skript: awesome, i will do that in a few, was just reviewing your commits
[21:10] DrMcKay: yacoob: and node.js managed to become what Python is for Tornado
[21:10] chrisvtx has joined the channel
[21:10] DrMcKay: yacoob: so, we have a lot of libraries, because it's a whole ecosystem
[21:10] AvianFlu: really huge open source community
[21:10] DrMcKay: we have awesome people, and so on
[21:11] levi: Yeah, node.js is not just a library, it's a language distribution + core libraries + package managment
[21:11] DrMcKay: levi++
[21:11] v8bot_:  DrMcKay has given a beer to levi. levi now has 1 beers.
[21:12] yacoob: I've written some javascript, and I was hoplessly lost untill reading that thin book, about its good parts.

[22:43] PastorBones: use child and send it as an argument?
[22:43] DPG: hmm
[22:43] PastorBones: or socket.io and send it over the net
[22:43] xerox: or dnode
[22:43] xerox: which can use a unix socket
[22:43] DPG: but i dont want to send it over net
[22:43] PastorBones: or aggregate it through couchdb or redis...couchdb has a _changes thing
[22:44] DPG: because i think its not performant
[22:44] Jabbers: socket.io < dnode < hook.io
[22:44] DPG: okey problem:
[22:44] DPG: 2 servers
[22:44] DPG: (websocket)
[22:44] DPG: and login to one server
[22:44] PastorBones: you can send it over a localhost socket so it's not really going 'out on the net'
[22:44] ggg: xerox, thanks, this oesnt work
[22:44] DPG: then you get an id for logging in
[22:44] ggg: it send an empty document all time
[22:44] DPG: and then you can connect to the second server
[22:45] TheJH: DrMcKay, thinking... if I replace the 2gb microsd card of my android with 16 or 32 gb...
[22:45] TheJH: DrMcKay, I could do anything!
[22:45] TheJH: ACTION is in heaven
[22:45] DPG: i should use the net module?
[22:45] davidascher has joined the channel
[22:45] DPG: and a server in both processes?
[22:46] DPG: and then push JSON-data via the tunnel?
[22:46] xerox: ggg: sorry?
[22:46] DPG: right?
[22:46] skiz has joined the channel
[22:46] ggg: I get an empty document in my broswer
[22:46] DPG: ggg whats your problem?
[22:46] ggg: the get works, but i doesnt send my stringified json
[22:46] ggg: it*
[22:47] ggg: but en empty document
[22:47] DPG: try to log the server output
[22:47] ggg: its like my res.send is executed even if my JSON,stringified isnt done
[22:47] DPG: before sending it
[22:47] DPG: ggg :;
[22:47] knifed has joined the channel
[22:48] DPG: res.send(JSON.stringify(var));
[22:48] DPG: try this... then it must be execc
[22:48] DPG: and try to log the output data
[22:48] DPG: before sending it
[22:48] ggg: I did log it
[22:48] ggg: I can see it
[22:48] DPG: and its all right?
[22:48] TheJH: good night
[22:49] DPG: gn
[22:49] ggg: but I cant log it, if i put the stringify in the .send
[22:49] DPG: yes that's right
[22:49] DPG: then try setTimeout
[22:49] DPG: only to debug not for the solution =)
[22:50] ggg: setTimout ?
[22:50] DPG: setTimeout(function(){something();},1000);
[22:50] DPG: delay of 1second to do something();
[22:51] ggg: oh ok
[22:51] DPG: if its the problem of sending before exec then it should send if you delay it
[22:51] DPG: =)
[22:51] ggg: is this in milliseconds?
[22:51] DPG: yes
[22:51] DPG: and clearTimeout(var); clears it
[22:52] DPG: this means it dont run
[22:52] DPG: if you set var = setTimeout()...;
[22:52] DPG: useful function =)

[22:54] PastorBones: how do I add ?group=true to a cradle view query?
[22:54] ggg: kinda confused
[22:54] ggg: when to use clearTimeout
[22:54] DPG_ has joined the channel
[22:54] DPG: if you dont want to run the code
[22:55] DPG_: but in this case you dont have to use it

[22:56] xerox: ggg: 
[22:56] xerox: my connection dropped sorry
[22:56] xerox: have you read the link I gave you?
[22:56] xerox: links even
[22:57] ggg:  TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON
[22:57] DPG_: wtf
[22:57] ggg: I hVE
[22:57] xerox: that is not the answer to my question, but I guess not
[22:57] ggg: I have
[22:57] xerox: app.get('/', function(req, res){
[22:57] xerox:   res.json({'ggg':{'boop':23}})
[22:57] xerox: });
[22:57] ggg: i tried this xeror
[22:57] ggg: if i put a value in .json it works
[22:58] ggg: but if i put a json.Stringgify it sends an empty content
[22:58] xerox: then you haven't read the second link
[22:58] xerox: https://github.com/visionmedia/express/blob/master/lib/response.js#L97
[22:58] xerox: see what res.json does?
[22:59] ggg: ohh....my bad, thought it was the link for res.json from the express website
[22:59] ggg: so I thought i had seen it
[22:59] xerox: that was the first one
[22:59] ggg: ill give it a shot
[22:59] xerox: which has examples
[22:59] xerox: the same examples in the comments there
[23:00] gkmngrgn has joined the channel
[23:01] ggg: it still sends a 204 No Content to my browser
[23:02] xerox: console.log the object you're passing to res.json
[23:02] xerox: maybe it's empty

[23:08] neurodrone: any reason why process.ENOTFOUND might be showing as 'undefined'?
[23:08] neurodrone: v0.4.4 btw
[23:09] zmbmartin has joined the channel
[23:09] ggg: so my function return undefined all the time
[23:09] ggg: when i request it in another module
[23:09] ggg: but if i console.log the result in te module, its fine
[23:11] xerox: you got some debugging to do :)

[23:11] lynxnathan has joined the channel
[23:11] kerigan: cool thanks rick
[23:15] ggg: why would return result.parcours;   returns undefined
[23:15] ggg: while a line over, it gets printed in the console??

[23:25] ggg: thanks for your help man
[23:25] DrMcKay: Nuck: MIT
[23:26] neurodrone: Is there a reason why ENOTFOUND is not included when constants were moved away from process.*?

[23:28] DPG_: which modules do you use?
[23:29] chrisvtx1 has joined the channel
[23:29] neurodrone: require('constants') seems to have everything else but ENOTFOUND.
[23:31] DPG_: ggg?
[23:31] DPG_: i think i have a idea what's wrong
[23:31] DPG_: but not sure
[23:31] codely has joined the channel
[23:32] ggg: go ahead :P
[23:32] DPG_: could it be that you stringify it twice?
[23:32] yacoob has left the channel
[23:32] Nuck: MIT you say?
[23:32] ggg: dont think so
[23:32] DPG_: hmmm
[23:32] DPG_: :(
[23:32] ggg: mongodb returns me and array of objects
[23:32] ggg: then I res.json it
[23:33] DPG_: and res.json does?
[23:33] DPG_: res.send(JSON.stringify) - like?
[23:33] ggg: its like my app res.send/res.json and console.log the value of my var before its actually found in the database
[23:33] ggg: yah its like that DPG
[23:33] Nuck: ggg: Ghe problem is simple
[23:34] Nuck: Yore returning in an async function
[23:34] Nuck: Use a callback function
[23:34] Nuck: Async means no more return
[23:34] ggg: that what I thought... but how, they are in differen modules...?
[23:34] DPG_: ahh nuck is right i think
[23:35] DPG_: but i dont use mongodb so i cant help much :/
[23:35] Nuck: Add cb as the last argument and call it when things are done
[23:35] ggg: cb?
[23:35] ggg: callback..sorry
[23:35] Nuck: ggg: Yeah lol
[23:36] DPG_: ggg nucks solution should work^^
[23:36] Nuck: :) I use mongo for good reason
[23:36] DPG_: which is it?
[23:37] ryanrolds: I, too, hate my data and referential integrity. 
[23:37] Nuck: ryanrolds: Was that a jab at mongo?
[23:37] Nuck: :P
[23:37] ryanrolds: ^_^
[23:38] Nuck: ryanrolds: It only has problems if you set it up wrong ;)
[23:39] ryanrolds: Are you running two duplicate mongodb servers?
[23:39] Nuck: ryanrolds: No, but I've got mine configured well and I plan to add more
[23:39] ryanrolds: If you don't have two setup with replication, you hate your data and want it to die.
[23:40] Nuck: ryanrolds: We will for production 
[23:40] ggg: ok, so the variable in my callback function should be what is returned ?
[23:40] DPG_: i think so
[23:40] DPG_: and i think there should be an error variable
[23:40] DPG_: but unsure because of mongodb^^
[23:41] Nuck: Huh?
[23:41] Nuck: ggg: You never return
[23:41] Nuck: Eve
[23:41] Nuck: Ever
[23:41] ggg: how do i get the value from my function that queries in the database?
[23:42] Nuck: ggg: You pass the value as an argument to the callback
[23:43] ggg: how?
[23:43] Nuck: ggg: Like you would with any function
[23:43] ggg: my function basically is if(err) console else return the value
[23:44] Nuck: ggg: Else cb(Val)
[23:44] ggg: is there a good link that explains this concept6
[23:44] ggg: ?
[23:45] ggg: no offense, but i dont want to waste your time
[23:45] ggg: with stuff that is probably really basic
