[01:32] dnunes: malkomalko: What you mean?
[01:32] dnunes: malkomalko: "require" is a function that usually returns an object.
[01:33] malkomalko: require('foo') && require.paths && require.resolve('foo')
[01:33] dnunes: malkomalko: You can "chain" the calls like "require('some_lib').PROPERTY_OR_METHOD" because the "require" call will return an object.

[01:35] dnunes: malkomalko: I'm not sure if you could use some "default" method in JS. I can't think of a way right now, but I'm pretty sure there must be something like "toString" or something.

[01:36] sshaginyan_: :)
[01:36] rauchg: the data is not there
[01:36] sshaginyan_: I know

[01:39] dnunes: rauchg: Hey there. I'm trying to understand exactly what it takes to make the Flash Socket to work in socket.io. Any tips on how to debug the problem that might be happening (the error message or stack trace, or timeout...) inside the SWF will be welcome as well.
[01:39] dnunes: rauchg: I currently know that the Flash Socket is not working and it's giving me the message "[WebSocket] Error: Error calling method on NPObject!" on Firefox.
[01:40] dnunes: rauchg: But it gives me no error message on IE, so I don't know if it would maybe work with a longer timeout or if it actually crashed or was limited by my current config.
[01:40] dnunes: I mean... The socket.io tried it and it "didn't work", but why?
[01:41] sveimac has joined the channel

[01:42] rauchg: oh i see
[01:42] rauchg: please try
[01:42] rauchg: same-host
[01:42] rauchg: my guess is that it's a cross-domain issue
[01:42] dnunes: Currently Firefox is working over xhr-streaming and IE over json-polling.
[01:42] rauchg: oh yeahc
[01:42] rauchg: cross-domain
[01:42] rauchg: can you file a ticket
[01:42] dnunes: I'm using cross domain. Is that a blocking problem for Flash Sockets?
[01:42] rauchg: i'll look at it shortly
[01:43] rauchg: shouldn't be, but i guess that slipped through testing
[01:43] dnunes: Ok. I'll post a bug on github with all the info I can gather.

[01:51] rauchg: oh sorry about that
[01:51] rauchg: then
[01:51] rauchg: the problem is

[01:51] dgathright has joined the channel
[01:51] rauchg: to WebSocketInsecure.swf
[01:51] rauchg: to work over the cross domain

[01:51] dnunes: rauchg: I tried that to the insecure. But I can only host the insecure.swf in my Apache server, not on the node.js.
[01:52] dnunes: rauchg: Maybe it's a no-go as well?
[01:53] dnunes: rauchg: I don't control the Node.JS server, so I must use only the default config with no messing around. Pointing the SWFLocation to my Insecure.swf on Apache Server removes the error, but still don't work.
[01:53] dnunes: *doesn't

[01:53] dnunes: rauchg: As far as I know, by default the Insecure.swf is in a zip, inacessible by default on Node.JS server, right?

[01:54] sshaginyan_: rauchg: I'm sorry rauchg can you check if this is correct http://pastie.org/2104300
[01:54] dnunes: rauchg: I got the file on my machine and hosted on a Apache server, but it doesn't work still. And unziping it inside the Node.JS server is not an option for me.
[01:54] rauchg: where's the .end event
[01:54] rauchg: sshaginyan_

[04:12] chapel: rpj8: it has always worked in chrome

[04:14] rpj8: chapel: a few weeks ago it was failing me pretty hard.
[04:14] rpj8: perhaps it was firefox
[04:14] rpj8: i can't remember
[04:14] masom: rpj8: Chrome had WebSocket for a while now
[04:14] rpj8: yes it wasn't that

[04:15] yenz: </rant>
[04:16] yenz: masom: shooting elephants in the face?
[04:16] abraxas: Is it true that socket.io's retry timings cannot really be overridden? The way it behaves is disastrous for mobile devices.
[04:16] yenz: abraxas: how so?
[04:16] dguttman has joined the channel
[04:17] abraxas: If it fails to connect, it starts falling back to other methods, and the retry time increases again, and again and again.
[04:17] abraxas: I don't want retry time to increase.
[04:17] abraxas: If I enter a tunnel, and I leave it 2 minutes later, the retry time may already have been increased to over a minute.
[04:18] abraxas: "The amount of milliseconds before we try to connect to the server again. We are using a exponential back off algorithm for the following reconnections, on each reconnect attempt this value will get multiplied (500 > 1000 > 2000 > 4000 > 8000)."
[04:19] context-: yenz: yeah. my work uses godaddy. i told them i wont touch the account.  cant stand the administration.  regfly is even worse
[04:20] wookiehangover has joined the channel
[04:20] context-: 2 minute tunnel you may hit the 128 second timeout. wait a whole nother two minutes
[04:20] abraxas: Yeah, that's disastrous.
[04:20] abraxas: I live in Tokyo, people take subways here. This is a common pattern.
[04:21] abraxas: It would render the entire app useless.
[04:21] brolin has joined the channel
[04:21] abraxas: In the subway, there's only 3G at the stations. So 90% of the time, there is no connection.
[04:21] abraxas: But at those stops, I want to be able to use that connection.
[04:22] Lorentz: I'm not aware of direct api for altering reconnection timing
[04:22] Aria: Yeah, exponential backoff needs to be capped.
[04:22] abraxas: Exactly.
[04:22] joshthecoder has joined the channel
[04:22] abraxas: I think exponential is simply a bad idea.
[04:22] Lorentz: Worst comes to worst, fork and change code in it :S
[04:22] Destos has joined the channel
[04:23] abraxas: Perhaps the API could simply offer users to provide an array: [500, 1000, 1000, 1000, 5000] (and it will keep retrying with 5000 after that)
[04:23] yenz: heh.. exponential backoff is "standard" for retry algorithms.  just isn't well-suited to the Tokyo Subway use case :/
[04:23] abraxas: or any other cellphone use case :)
[04:24] abraxas: where bad reception is just part of life.
[04:24] Aria: It's meant for keeping client floods from taking down a server.
[04:24] Aria: It's not meant as a general purpose "always do this", there's a reason it's used.
[04:24] abraxas: Sure.
[04:24] abraxas: Would be great if developers could have a choice though
[04:24] Aria: So in this case, I think it's terribly suited. It just happens to work when good connectivity is the norm.
[04:25] abraxas: You have a point.
[04:25] yenz: abraxas: Lorentz already suggested the solution ;)
[04:25] abraxas: forking... great.
[04:25] Lorentz: Remember to write your change well, and request for a pull
[04:25] abraxas: My situation is not that unique :)

[07:24] Nuck: Oh noes

[07:25] Tobsn: keyvan, with node.js mongodb is super easy to handle - also #mongodb is a lot of help for mongodb related questions, you have all the main developers of 10gen in there
[07:25] Tobsn: very very helpful

[07:27] Tobsn: mekwall, i still stick with openvz does something mongodb doesnt recognize
[07:27] Tobsn: ;)
[07:27] Tobsn: so its probably a 50:50 issue
[07:27] mekwall: probably
[07:27] Tobsn: know what i mean?
[07:27] mekwall: yes
[07:27] Tobsn: openvz probably assigns the vmemory in a weird way
[07:27] Tobsn: and mongodb expects it in a the "real" way
[07:28] Tobsn: and bam
[07:28] mekwall: but couchdb works and nearly all other software ;)

[07:31] polotek: mongodb uses memory mapped files. and it also uses a ton of RAM by design

[07:31] Tobsn: well

[07:32] [AD]Turbo: hi there
[07:32] Tobsn: you know, unused ram is unused ram
[07:32] Lorentz: Might as well use it
[07:32] romanb has joined the channel
[07:32] polotek: exactly, so if a virtual environment doesn't implement memory mapped files in a robust way, there will be problems

[07:36] thalll has joined the channel
[07:36] Nuck: Lorentz: I use Linux for my servers i dunno what YOU'RE talking about :P
[07:36] Lorentz: Probably never will do it properly. There's never really any situation where you really have unlimited memory.
[07:36] halfhalo has joined the channel
[07:36] Lorentz: So why write code that does assume unlimited memory.
[07:37] polotek: Lorentz: it doesn't assume unlimited memory
[07:37] Nuck: Lorentz: Because it scales well?
[07:37] polotek: maybe the user code does, but that's different
[07:37] polotek: the mmap you just use it like a file
[07:37] Nuck: Better than tj's Memory SessionStore in Express
[07:37] polotek: and if there's no memory it should surface as a "could not write file" type of error
[07:38] polotek: I'm sure I'm dumbing it down
[07:38] polotek: possible even getting it completely wrong
[07:38] polotek: but it certainly has a mechanism to tell you when you're out of RAM

[08:19] Tobsn: https://github.com/zzdhidden/mongoq
[08:19] jakeg: ta. is this better than mongoose?
[08:19] Tobsn: depends on what you need
[08:19] Tobsn: mongoose is a different type of lib for mongodb
[08:19] Tobsn: mongoq is very simple
[08:20] Tobsn: where mongoose is active record i think

[08:20] Tobsn: see examples, they compare
[08:21] Tobsn: see with mongoose you can create models
[08:21] Tobsn: the stuff i do is very crude so mongoq is good enough for me
[08:22] Tobsn: my frontend is php and for that i actually use activemongo which is an activerecord class

[08:34] Charuru: that was a dumb statment
[08:34] Charuru: i mean
[08:34] Tobsn: looks almost the same to me
[08:34] Charuru: io.sockets.on('connection', instead of io.on('connection',
[08:34] `3rdEden: notice the 7 in the logo ;)?

[08:48] Nuck: bogomips2__: Should still work, but never use window.
[08:48] Nuck: Not even in the browser
[08:48] Tobsn: bogomips2__, the same way

[13:17] sioked has joined the channel
[13:17] squeese has joined the channel
[13:19] ablomen: aslakhellesoy, you might want to put it on a git/svn/whatever server and pull it wherever you need it
[13:19] ablomen: i don't think you can (easily) set up an npm server (can be very wrong though) and use that, so this is the next best way to handle versions, updates etc
[13:20] aslakhellesoy: ablomen: I'll just put it on an internal web server, and other apps can refer to it with a full url in their package.json
[13:20] aslakhellesoy: My question is not about uploading, but *packaging*
[13:20] aslakhellesoy: How do I turn my lib into a tgz basically
[13:21] aslakhellesoy: I think npm does that as part of "npm publish")
[13:21] brolin has joined the channel
[13:22] ablomen: that's what i am saying, putting it in a tar might not be the best way, using something like git will give you the option to update stuff, fork it for different cases etc, if you just extract a tar every time keeping track of your changes etc will become a huge hassle
[13:23] ablomen: and that way, it would be "packaged" in a git branch

[14:04] shinuza: vpereira: hum, too bad it's pre 0.5 based
[14:04] jbroman has joined the channel
[14:04] bingomanatee: or for that matter the names of the scoped variables in node.js  in general?
[14:04] Roelven has left the channel
[14:04] Tobsn: i like that the suggestion stuff is bbq too
[14:04] vpereira: shinuza: is that a problem?
[14:04] shinuza: vpereira: it's not stable, and wont be before long
[14:05] shinuza: I think Ryan talked about ~5 months
[14:05] vpereira: shinuza: but how unstable are the things with node.js?
[14:05] bingomanatee: PHP is not stable :D
[14:06] vpereira: bingomanatee: ?
[14:06] bingomanatee: It has memory leaks

[14:08] tuhoojabotti: v8: "lol".toString(2)
[14:08] v8bot: tuhoojabotti: "lol"

[14:14] bingomanatee: The modules which interpret requests and send responses work quite well
[14:15] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[14:15] bingomanatee: I think when people talk about instability in node, they mean that  Ryan & co reserve the right to change apis into their modules
[14:15] bingomanatee: but in my experience most of the core modules have been through several iterations already
[14:15] bingomanatee: and what few changes they are likely to make will be very well documented. 
[14:16] pandeiro has joined the channel
[14:16] bingomanatee: and you will have the opportunity to freeze the version of node for a particular project and get in front of said changes very managebly. 
[14:17] kawaz_air has joined the channel
[14:17] bingomanatee: express.js, which (in a VERY sloppy way) could be said to be the Rails of node, changes a little more aggressively and on its own sechedule
[14:17] jonaslund has joined the channel
[14:17] bingomanatee: however again: proper use of NPM will freeze you to to the version of express that you want fo a given project.

[14:20] dtan: member:bingomanatee - installing express via npm, you can still update your express version
[14:20] dtan: meh, drag and drop
[14:21] dtan: tj explained to me yesterday you'd have to update your package.json file of express to the newer version
[14:21] dtan: and then do a npm install , i think

[14:22] MarkMenard_ has joined the channel
[14:22] bingomanatee: dtan, yes - but you aren't FORCED to use a more current version of express than the one you start with by the local version of express that someone (else?) set up on a given deployment server.
[14:23] bingomanatee: Your desired version of express (or anything else) is carried with your git repo'd code base wherever it deploys. 
[14:23] dtan: ooh, i must have missed the previous part of the convo
[14:23] bingomanatee: It was the usual "Is node stable" blather. 
[14:23] dtan: right, you guys were discussing local v global express installs then i take it?
[14:23] Swimming_bird has joined the channel
[14:24] bingomanatee: my point being, node is not unstable - it is evolving - but you don't have to evolve at its pace if it isn't useful in the context of a specific project :D
[14:24] dtan: right
[14:25] dtan: just to get it straight, you can also have local installs of node per project if you wished, is that correct or am i mistaken?

[14:31] bolgovr has joined the channel
[14:31] bingomanatee: DTrejoAFKarchive, that is not EXACTLY true. Node is a binary so you can launch a project from a specific build of node, and you can store node in multiple folders
[14:32] bingomanatee: or use nvm (Node VERSION manager, as distinct from npm, node PACKAGE MANAGER) to switch to a "default" version of node. 
[14:33] bingomanatee: As wiith ruby, you have to be careful if you rely on globally installed modules AND use nvm; you may have to reinstall global modules after you switch versions of node in nvm. 
[14:33] bingomanatee: (which is why I would not in general rely on globally installed modules for any project :D) ) 
[14:34] vpereira: nvm, that's nice.. i was thinking about it yesterday :-)

[15:58] tjholowaychuk: = foo  will buffer the value of the js var "foo"
[15:58] tjholowaychuk: but it escapes html
[15:58] tjholowaychuk: != doesn't
[15:59] dtan: ooh so i need to do something like div!= partial....
[15:59] tjholowaychuk: yup
[15:59] dtan: hmmm getting this error: 500 SyntaxError: Jade:14 12| - } 13| - } > 14| div!= partial('./partials/fields.jade') 15| Unexpected identifier
[15:59] tjholowaychuk: and - is js code that does not buffer at all
[16:00] dtan: tj - not sure what you mean when you say "buffer'" 
[16:01] tjholowaychuk: dtan output
[16:01] meatmanek_ has joined the channel
[16:01] dtan: ok easy enough to understand
[16:01] CoverSlide: tjholowaychuk: any way of making a block of js code without repetitive `-`'s?
[16:01] bpierre has joined the channel
[16:01] tjholowaychuk: CoverSlide not currently
[16:01] tjholowaychuk: though thats a good indication you need to use more helpers
[16:01] CoverSlide: in the works?
[16:01] tjholowaychuk: to have less js
[16:02] tjholowaychuk: we do it in some of our templates too but we shouldnt
[16:02] CoverSlide: yeah i do most of my logic pre-rendering

[16:03] _Sorensen has joined the channel
[16:03] tjholowaychuk: haven't had much time to work on it lately but it's fun
[16:03] pyrotechnick: yeah man just looking at it seems like alot of fun and im really not that kind of excitable coder
[16:03] tjholowaychuk: tempted to go with a different concurrency model, passing around errors is a huge PITA
[16:04] pyrotechnick: is that reactor?
[16:04] topaxi has joined the channel
[16:04] tjholowaychuk: nothing is actually implement yet but that was the plan yup
[16:04] pyrotechnick: so would like haskell and stuff be non-reactor?
[16:05] tjholowaychuk: i like the event loop, but sometimes it's just a piss off haha
[16:05] pickels: Anybody got maybe a good blog post or info on how to write testable code with lots of callbacks? Could use some tips and techniques on that topic.
[16:05] pyrotechnick: yeah i get that feeling too
[16:05] tjholowaychuk: trying to build something reliable with errors coming from 25 different places is not fun
[16:05] pyrotechnick: i think sometimes it's just too much of a trade-off
[16:06] tjholowaychuk: might go with actors but I need to see what fits the language better once it's more complete
[16:06] pyrotechnick: thats basically where i'm headed with the game
[16:07] pyrotechnick: the actors
[16:07] swilson06: is there a good reason they use const instead of var here when new'ing up the modules? http://www.silassewell.com/blog/2010/06/03/node-js-https-ssl-server-example/
[16:08] charleyd has joined the channel
[16:08] bnoordhuis: swilson06: prevents accidental reassigning of the module object
[16:08] pyrotechnick: well assuming node actually enforces const
[16:08] pyrotechnick: then yeah
[16:08] pyrotechnick: ^^
[16:08] pyrotechnick: i think const is generally discouraged though, dont get used to writing it
[16:08] CoverSlide: does it?
[16:08] pyrotechnick: and if you're thinking about using your code in the browser i'd avoid it

[16:09] markwubben has joined the channel
[16:10] pyrotechnick: but yeah i'd avoid const
[16:10] swilson06: so, is there a security reason for it or just to prevent me from doing something stupid?
[16:10] bnoordhuis: swilson06: the latter
[16:10] pyrotechnick: if you've got variables being overwritten
[16:10] butu5 has joined the channel
[16:10] pyrotechnick: then you have much much larger security issues
[16:11] swilson06: right :)
[16:11] pyrotechnick: in the right circumstance i think const could perhaps be used to enhance the security of maybe a sandbox or something
[16:11] pyrotechnick: but as far as using it blindly just for the peace of mine it's probably not worth the effor
[16:11] pyrotechnick: effort*
[16:12] pyrotechnick: man my spelling is terrible tonight
[16:12] swilson06: ok, yeah, i just thought it was odd, so i'd ask.

[16:13] swilson06: ah, so it won't be used in the future...?

[16:14] swilson06: yeah, so i don't think i'll use it.
[16:14] BigWookie: Hey, got a question, i use node-irc and it seems there is improper handling of escape sequences
[16:14] swilson06: ACTION forgets about const
[16:15] heavysixer has joined the channel
[16:15] BigWookie: particular everything crashes from it ^^
[16:15] CoverSlide: really?
[16:16] CoverSlide: what error are you getting?
[16:16] bnoordhuis: CoverSlide: one could argue that mozilla's implementation is what all other impls are derived from
[16:16] patrickarlt has joined the channel

[16:25] madsleejensen has joined the channel
[16:25] mxp: nodejs vs nginx for comet which one is better?
[16:26] Aria: You still have to supply code to actually do "comet" or other long-poll techniques with nginx.
[16:26] Aria: node's a little closer to ready to go.
[16:26] CoverSlide: comet's pretty broad a term
[16:28] butu5: BigWookie: ur IRCNode working?
[16:28] Aria: Yeah. There's several more specific techniques. Long-polling, BOSH, WebSockets..
[16:28] hojberg has joined the channel
[16:29] CoverSlide: and the fact that nginx doesn't implement any of them ootb
[16:29] CoverSlide: it really depends on what you got going on doing the logic
[16:30] Aria: Yeah. They're not quite equivalent at all.
[16:30] BigWookie: butu5: partly, but I wrote much code for I2X and I would concider porting it to sencha touch ( mobile interfaces ) if there would be interrest
[16:30] adrianmg has joined the channel
[16:30] BigWookie: I2X is a jabber and irc bot that works as a bridge between the two
[16:31] mxp: I am looking for speed on a 2GB physical memory machine (Quad core) will nodejs help
[16:31] mxp: ?
[16:31] BigWookie: (because many mobile jabber implementations lack MUC ) 
[16:31] sioked1 has joined the channel
[16:31] seawise: guys, why we are chatting in IRC chat, but not Node.js backed chat? anybody have an answer?
[16:31] mxp: Aria, em focusing on BOSH
[16:31] BigWookie: seawise: yeah because its a standard
[16:31] Aria: seawise: Network effect.
[16:32] seawise: but it's outdated you don't think so?
[16:32] Aria: There's a node-based chat up. It's .. okay. But I much prefer my choice of tools to access the chat, rather than the web interface it presents.
[16:32] pt_tr has joined the channel
[16:32] CoverSlide: it is really just a demo
[16:32] seawise: also we may to promote Node.js with somewhat of NodeHub
[16:32] seawise: also
[16:32] Aria: It sends adequately sized chunks of text to people. Do you need more in a chat protocol?
[16:33] saschagehlich has joined the channel
[16:33] seawise: I'm caching this chat and find it a great source of knowledge
[16:33] CoverSlide: it isn't supposed to be for actual conversations
[16:33] seawise: but it's unindexed
[16:33] BigWookie: irc is not outdated as long as there is nothing that fits better
[16:33] CoverSlide: and doesn't have 1/1000th the features of IRC
[16:33] seawise: no one can search our talks by Google/Yahoo
[16:33] mxp: Aira I will be wrapping a XMPP server with NodeJS
[16:33] seawise: in our company we use Flowdock as group chat
[16:34] seawise: it have tags, search
[16:34] mxp: this will allow me to have auth in NodeJS and use async to feed data
[16:34] mxp: to browser
[16:34] seawise: it will be very useful to have real-time Node wiki as chat
[16:34] seawise: searchable and indexable?

[18:14] swilson06: what database do you guys generally use with node? i ask because i use mysql but most of the text i've seen use nosql engines and i'm curious if i should consider this instead of mysql?
[18:14] Aria: It depends on the sort of data you're storing.
[18:14] BillyBreen has joined the channel
[18:15] Aria: relational databases are good at stuff where you're asking relatively complex, relational questions.
[18:15] Aria: They're terrible as load-store systems.

[18:17] CoverSlide: go with one, try it out
[18:17] Aria: I'd probably go NoSQL for that.
[18:17] Aria: Or even the filesystem.
[18:18] swilson06: not complex queries but maybe complex fields...
[18:18] quackquack has joined the channel
[18:18] davidwalsh has joined the channel
[18:18] Aria: Complex fields? Mongo rocks at that -- since the store is a big object.
[18:18] Aria: If you want to, say, generate a table comparing two groups of stuff, SQL's your answer. It's GREAT at that.
[18:18] swilson06: ok, thanks
[18:19] Aria: If you want to load a pile of userdata for display, Mongo's gonna rock.
[18:19] bene1 has joined the channel
[18:19] Aria: "Give me user X's stuff" "Okay, here you go"
[18:19] MooGoo: are there any NoSQL's that are any good at full text search?
[18:19] pickels: What would you use for nested trees Aria?
[18:19] Aria: pickels: Depends on how you want to traverse that tree. An object stored in mongo is a nested tree itself, so...
[18:19] swilson06: Aria: thanks, i guess i'll have to read up on nosql :)
[18:20] Aria: Hehe. Just remember that each NoSQL has its own purpose. It's not SQL or Not, it's "what's the best database for this kind of data"
[18:20] Aria: I also love Redis -- but it's another beast entirely.
[18:20] jerrysv: swilson06: postgres, couchdb, and redis
[18:20] jerrysv: are what i've used with node
[18:20] pickels: swilson06, Mongoose was easy for me to get started with MongoDB
[18:21] pickels: The docs pretty okay also.

[18:22] SkyRocknRoll has joined the channel
[18:22] jerrysv: moogoo: depends? couchdb maybe depending on how you create your views?
[18:22] Aria: I'm not sure MooGoo. I've not looked.

[18:23] Aria: Sphinx could be called "a nosql database" ;-)
[18:23] jerrysv: moogoo: http://legitimatesounding.com/blog/NoSQL_meet_SQL.html
[18:23] jerrysv: :)
[18:23] Aria: swilson06: mongo's much more than just "an array or hash" -- it's got some very reasonable query facilities.
[18:23] MooGoo: say I have a large table full of IRC log data
[18:23] Aria: And you can mapreduce to cache fancier stuff.
[18:24] swilson06: yeah, i've heard that sphinx is pretty much *it* for full text (but i couldn't remember it before Aria said the name)

[18:51] framlin: couchdb is available for android, too ... it has the concept of couchapp, that are webablications stored within the db itself and implemented with HTML/CSS/JS where JS is the "query-language", combined with node there could be a lot of possibilities for JS-coders ...

[18:53] hkjels: CoverSlide: Nope. I'm using stdout.on and write out to stdout
[18:53] CoverSlide: err process1.stdout.pipe(grepProcess.stdin)

[19:04] MooGoo: those are key stores arent they
[19:04] bradley: key stores are valid dbs if used properly, im not sure what you are wanting?
[19:04] CoverSlide: is eventvat persistent?
[19:04] MooGoo: I'm just curious
[19:05] MooGoo: I dont think a key store would be apropriate for a general irc log table
[19:05] bradley: coverslide it can write out to a file, but i dont think it has writethrough and i wouldnt use it until its got an RC
[19:05] Aria: What do you want to do with these logs?
[19:05] MooGoo: take over the world
[19:06] Aria: That's the real question. a kv store is a good start for an inverted index to search by content.

[19:21] mape: felixge: ;;;;;;;;;; ?
[19:22] Murvin: bnoordhuis: That's what I think what happened about stale socket causing no more new request being taken:   let say my max socket is 1000.   and i run a concurrent test with 1000req/sec
[19:22] MooGoo: what?
[19:22] felixge: mape: http://ironjs.wordpress.com/2011/06/22/my-gripes-with-javascript/ is hotlinking a photo I took, I intend to replace it with something els e;)

[19:23] felixge: MooGoo: I also should be writing code right now, it all works out ;)
[19:23] bnoordhuis: Murvin: the thing is that net.js is being overhauled in the switch to libuv
[19:23] MooGoo: no u should be trolling on irc
[19:23] Murvin: bnoordhuis: in the lib/http.js    socket has a fix  timeout of 2 minutes.   If, during this 2 minutes, i have more than 1000 fail requests, then no more socket for new requests.

[19:24] Murvin: bnoordhuis:  and when all available sockets are not released, it seems that it won't be fixed until server restart.
[19:25] fwg: huh, is HEAD building on osx for anyone?
[19:26] Murvin: bnoordhuis: to fix that, either incrase the maxSocket or reduce the timeout in lib/http.js   that will do. but not the perfect fix.
[19:26] bnoordhuis: Murvin: can you check how man open file descriptors `lsof` reports?
[19:26] Murvin: bnoodhuis: the other way is to manually write a timeout routine, and issue http.clientRequest.abort();  
[19:26] bnoordhuis: Murvin: if it only increases, never decreases, there must be a leak

[19:27] tjholowaychuk: i did 2k requests, which made 2k calls to (async) fs.close() in node and it would leak roughly 5 per 2k requests

[19:30] bnoordhuis: Murvin: or `lsof -i 4 -p PID` if you only want sockets

[19:31] Murvin: bnoordhuis: how to know if there is a leak by reading the output ? :)
[19:32] bnoordhuis: Murvin: at the number of sockets listed, e.g. `lsof -i 4 -p PID | wc -l`
[19:32] tjholowaychuk: tauren table.grid(class=whatever)
[19:32] tjholowaychuk: will combine both
[19:32] chapel: fwg: most times osx wont build head
[19:32] tauren: tjholowaychuk: thanks!
[19:32] taf2: too bad it's not a gif...
[19:32] bnoordhuis: Murvin: or even better `watch 'lsof -i 4 -p PID | wc -l'` - if the number keeps steadily growing, you probably have a leak
[19:32] mape: felixge: if you find a better one let me know and I'll put it in there
[19:32] Murvin: bnoordhuis:  ok.  cool. i will do the test soon.

[20:56] isaacs: bronson: hey, you around?
[20:56] bronson: isaacs, yep, good observation!
[20:57] isaacs: malkomalko: have your functions call their cb with an error as the first arg.  it is the Node Way.
[20:57] isaacs: malkomalko: then handle that error.
[20:57] isaacs: bronson: hey, so, that . <(npm completion) thingie..
[20:57] isaacs: really super weird
[20:57] adambeynon has joined the channel
[20:57] darnold has joined the channel
[20:57] isaacs: bronson: it seems like "." actually closes its argument.
[20:57] bronson: yeah, I mean good observation that it might be writing to stderr.
[20:57] fairwinds has joined the channel
[20:57] isaacs: nono, it's not that
[20:57] isaacs: writing to stderr is actually fine.
[20:57] bronson: oh, interesting.
[20:57] isaacs: the problem is that when it tries to write to stdout, it gets an epipe
[20:58] malkomalko: I'm writing a testing library and trying to think of the best way to handle writing my function bodies, and having assertions return with an error if there is a deeply nested async call within my test body
[20:58] isaacs: which normally would indicate that the pipe has been closed
[20:58] isaacs: bronson: note that `cat <(npm completion)` *doesn't* have any problem.
[20:58] bronson: isaacs, agreed, I noticed that too.
[20:58] mscdex: jas_a: there's this at least: https://github.com/wadey/node-thrift
[20:58] bronson: I assume you're using bash?  Wonder if zsh is less twitchy.
[20:59] isaacs: bronson: i am.  bash is the standard.
[20:59] isaacs: bronson: this is also fine: head -n 10 <(npm completion)
[21:00] isaacs: so, it seems like the way to make this work is definitely going to involve handling teh EPIPE, somehow.
[21:00] mape: isaacs: Thanks for the awsome swag! qr-code works fine :D
[21:00] figital has joined the channel
[21:01] bronson: isaacs, w. t. f.
[21:01] bronson: why would it even get an EPIPE?
[21:01] isaacs: mape: hooray!!
[21:01] jas_a: mscdex: well, i'm open to other architectures as well. we are just in teh 'talking' phase. basically mobile phoen app to server to DB/storage of some kind. 
[21:01] isaacs: mape: thanks for making the logo
[21:01] mscdex: jas_a: also: https://github.com/racker/node-cassandra-client
[21:01] jas_a: mscdex: are there some case studies of something similar using node.js that i can look at?
[21:01] mape: isaacs: for the greater good!
[21:02] isaacs: bronson: inorite?
[21:04] AvianFlu has joined the channel
[21:04] isaacs: bronson: yeah, so... i'm gonna just set it to ignore the stupid EPIPE and keep on chugging.
[21:04] bronson: Is there anything weird with the way npm/node starts up?
[21:04] robertfw has joined the channel
[21:04] bronson: isaacs, right on.
[21:04] Poetro has joined the channel
[21:04] isaacs: the only reason i'm a bit concerned is that i don't want to just ignore possible errors in node.
[21:04] Poetro has joined the channel
[21:04] bronson: agreed.
[21:04] isaacs: that being said, EPIPE is a pretty common signal, and should really be handled in app-specific ways, i suppose.
[21:05] isaacs: so, if `source` actually is giving us an epipe, the right thing for node to do would be to raise it in my app
[21:05] bronson: wait, what's giving EPIPE?
[21:05] isaacs: either ".", or the process substitution itself.
[21:05] rpflo has joined the channel

[21:05] jas_a: is anyone using node.js in the mobile app (eg iphone) space?
[21:05] bronson: can't be stdout, bash still exists and wouldn't have closed it.  right?
[21:05] bronson: playing for a sec.
[21:06] isaacs: bronson: well, in a <() proc sub situation, "stdout" is actually pretending to be a file descriptor for another program.
[21:06] Nuck: Is there a Node.js app in the cydia stuff?
[21:06] isaacs: it's a bit like doing:  npm completion | some-program <&1
[21:07] jas_a: sorry, i meant having an iphone app communicate to a node.js server to push/pull data (images, authentication, etc.)
[21:07] Nuck: ACTION is so proud of his ability to read what isaacs says
[21:07] Nuck: jas_a: Just use normal HTTP PUT, PUSH, GET, etc.
[21:08] Nuck: As long as you use standards, you'll be find :D

[21:09] Nuck: jas_a: No, but Node.js can handle the loads VERY well.

[21:10] Nuck: jas_a: Just create an API in Express, it's what I'm doing.

[21:10] isaacs: bronson: i can write to stderr all over the place, though, and it has no effect.
[21:11] isaacs: bronson: i mean, are you sure it's working, or is it just hiding the error?
[21:11] jas_a: Nuck: can you send me a link?

[21:22] phpnode: jerrysv: if i take the request out, i get 400 requests / second
[21:23] jerrysv: phpnode: and when you run ab against _search from the same host node is running on, you get ~200/second ?
[21:23] isaacs: bronson: it's definitely closing npm's stdout, but it seems like it closes it just in time for the first write()
[21:24] phpnode: jerrysv: yeah

[22:02] isaacs: jhurliman: npm link ../my-private-thing
[22:03] bnoordhuis: tyler-iphone: that's a linker error, how are you linking to clucene?
[22:03] isaacs: jhurliman: you should also put "private":true in the package.json in your private thing
[22:03] isaacs: jhurliman: and probably all the thigns that use it
[22:03] tyler-iphone: bnoordhuis: #include <CLucene.h>
[22:04] jhurliman: isaacs, what is the npm link part?
[22:04] bnoordhuis: tyler-iphone: you need to add `-lclucene` in your makefile / wscript / whatever
[22:04] bnoordhuis: tyler-iphone: provided you want to link to the dynamic library

[22:06] bnoordhuis: tyler-iphone: you might need to wrap the #include in an extern "C" { #include <...> }
[22:06] jhurliman: isaacs, our current workflow for a new developer to checkout the code and start working is to git clone the private repo and then run "npm install" to grab all of the depenencies. would npm link be a third step that devs need to do?
[22:06] tyler-iphone: i686-apple-darwin11-llvm-g++-4.2: -lclucene: linker input file unused because linking not done

[22:06] dall: Guys, I'm developing a very very very small web framework (only to understand how node could be good for me website) ... I have a question about fs module.... if i read a file and then send the response... the client will receive all the code obviously, my questions is: how can I do to let node interprets a piace of this file? is it possible? do I have to use special "tags" or do i have to write a module myself that under
[22:06] dall: stand which tags to interpret and then send back the response? (I will understand you if you don't understand my question) :-D
[22:06] isaacs: jhurliman: actually, it'd be a 1.5th step ;)
[22:06] davidbanham has joined the channel
[22:06] jerrysv: get rid of the -lclucene you added, add the extern "C" {}
[22:06] isaacs: jhurliman: do it before the `npm install`
[22:07] jhurliman: ah ok
[22:07] bnoordhuis: tyler-iphone jerrysv: clucence is a c++ project, i think? but is its api c or c++?
[22:07] jerrysv: dall: maybe use a templating system, like mustache, or handlebars?
[22:07] Skola: is there a good js lib for primes and other number theory related functions?
[22:08] tyler-iphone: bnoordhuis: the demo files included in distrp are .cpp
[22:08] tyler-iphone: distro*
[22:08] jhurliman: it would be nice if there was some way to specify that step in the base project's package.json. so when running npm install it knew to link to the module at ../my_cool_module
[22:08] dall: jerrysv, mustache... hmmm I see how it works
[22:08] Bwen: jhurliman: but what if the module is not cool? :(
[22:09] jerrysv: dall: personally i prefer handlebars though :)

[22:14] tyler-iphone: bnoordhuis: i have #include <CLucene.h> im not so good at c++ so i don't know if thats an included dependency
[22:14] bnoordhuis: Murvin: thanks for the gist
[22:14] isaacs: jhurliman: yeah, a few times folks have asked for that.  i dunno, though.  it's kinda brittle, and would be hard to prevent un-resolvable stuff from going into the registry.
[22:15] bnoordhuis: Murvin: i think i know what / where it's going wrong
[22:15] isaacs: jhurliman: maybe it could be allowed iff "private":true is in the package.json file, or could imply private:true or something.
[22:15] jhurliman: yeah
[22:15] isaacs: jhurliman: your best bet, really, would be to set up your own registry.
[22:15] jhurliman: for now i'm just copy pasting ~200 lines of code between the projects to avoid the extra setup step
[22:15] jhurliman: hmm
[22:16] isaacs: jhurliman: and then just `npm install` and it'll pull the deps from your private reg
[22:16] jhurliman: that's an idea
[22:16] isaacs: jhurliman: also, you can put: "publishConfig":{"registry":"http://my-internal-thing"} in your package.json, so you don't accidentally publish to the public reg

[22:22] bnoordhuis: tyler-iphone: ah... don't take offense but you might be in over your head
[22:22] tyler-iphone: bnoordhuis: im getting that feeling :) oh well sink or swim ;)

[22:24] tyler-iphone: jerrysv: cool
[22:24] Murvin: bnoordhuis:  I've just updated it.   I will keep update it when I have new discovery.   I update in gist.github.com.  is that the right place?
[22:24] bitwise_: hey whats best way to store data with node. just need to persist some simple lat/lon values
[22:24] tyler-iphone: the reason why im doing it in the first place is too learn about c++ and making wrappers
[22:24] tyler-iphone: to*
[22:25] bnoordhuis: Murvin: yes, that's fine
[22:25] Murvin: bnoordhuis:  :-)
[22:26] jerrysv: tyler-iphone: noble goal :)
[22:26] tyler-iphone: i know ruby/node/php/scala and go fairly decent but i suck in the c/c++ category

[22:56] wilfred: I think I've found a (trivial and unexciting) npm bug
[22:56] wilfred: is there a npm-specific channel?
[22:56] isaacs: wilfred: you're in the right place.
[22:56] isaacs: wilfred: and all npm bugs are exciting :)

[23:00] sh1mmer: I don't believe all NPM bugs are interesting to even you
[23:00] sh1mmer: but I'm sure not looking for one which is that dull
[23:00] wilfred: ah, I misread something. I'm afraid I can't even give you an unexciting bug :)
[23:00] isaacs: heh :)
[23:00] isaacs: wilfred: documentation wtfs are bugs, as well.
[23:01] sh1mmer: isaacs: see my last tweet btw. I'm sure it's an architectural thing, but it is interesting
[23:01] sh1mmer: I excepted to return false
[23:01] isaacs: wilfred: perhaps unfixable, but ideally, you wouldn't run into that "wait, what?" experience when using npm.
[23:01] TooTallNate has joined the channel
[23:02] jerrysv: speaking of npm bugs, just commented more on the semver bug i opened. hopefully as a reminder :)
[23:02] thoolihan has joined the channel
[23:03] wilfred: isaacs: so, I'm a complete novice. I did "$ npm search jshint", and only one line had an additional description so I thought it was a second package on the same line
[23:03] wilfred: perhaps a ps style header would help?
[23:03] isaacs: wilfred: hm, yeah, that'd be handy
[23:04] jacobolu_ has joined the channel
[23:04] isaacs: also, i really gotta get that server-side searching stuff from mbrevoort in there..
[23:04] isaacs: npm search has gotten godawful slow
[23:04] TooTallNate has joined the channel
[23:04] isaacs: wilfred: yeah, a header for npm search would be winful, and easy to do.  good idea. wanna post an issue?
[23:04] wilfred: will do
[23:05] isaacs: i'm thinking something simple like "name         description         keywords" or something

[23:07] tmpvar: it is definitely a dom though
[23:07] tmpvar: hey there jerrysv 
[23:07] jerrysv: must have a keyword finder on jsdom :)

[23:08] tmpvar: wow!, htmlparser even
[23:08] wilfred: done. https://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues/1068
[23:08] tmpvar: you can use aria's parser if you jump through some hoops (will be solved soon)
[23:09] isaacs: oh, no, html5 uses jsdom...
[23:09] isaacs: apaprently?
[23:09] isaacs: wilfred: thanks :)

[23:30] sh1mmer: niftylettuce: you don't need permission
[23:30] sh1mmer: niftylettuce: you can just do that
[23:30] Murvin: bnoordhuis: yes. i expect that too.. but there are some other behaviors that I don't expect from that.. and that causing slow down and crash 
[23:30] Murvin: bnoordhuis:  i will update in the gist later. 
[23:30] Murvin: :)
[23:31] niftylettuce: sh1mmer: i thought it was trademarked

[23:31] niftylettuce: sh1mmer: o_O maybe was thinking of something else

[23:31] niftylettuce: sh1mmer: ty :)
[23:31] Murvin: bnoordhuis: not a easy test.. took me hours. :)
[23:31] sh1mmer: The trademark means you have to get permission if you do something that implies a relationship with Joyent
[23:32] sh1mmer: For example, lots of stores sell Coca Cola, but they don't each need permission from Coke
[23:32] bnoordhuis: Murvin: well, good work :)
[23:32] sh1mmer: But you couldn't create the Coca Cola Distribution company
