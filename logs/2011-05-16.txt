[00:03] azend: and therefore how many users
[00:04] AvianFlu has joined the channel
[00:04] Jalava: azend: depends a lot on what node process has to do
[00:04] azend: alright
[00:04] Jalava: it can range anywhere between 10 requests / s to 300 req / s
[00:05] killfill: hey guys.. when using nStore and saving a document with key K, and after, save another document with the same key K, i see two registry on the db file
[00:05] killfill: is this normall?..
[00:05] azend: just trying to see how scaleable it is
[00:05] azend: if I use it for some higher traffic projects
[00:05] Jalava: well, scalability comes from adding more processes
[00:05] killfill: after some duplicate data, i get targetStart out of bounds
[00:06] Jalava: we use node for processing around 700 req / s for targeted ad distribution, not sure if that counts as higher traffic
[00:06] chjj: killfill: its append-only
[00:06] darshanshankar: has anyone been using cloudfoundry?
[00:07] chjj: killfill: could always try my in-process db ;)  https://github.com/chjj/node-tiny
[00:07] killfill: chjj, i guess that means users should vacuum it regulall
[00:07] chjj: its like nstore, but easier on memory with regards to querying
[00:08] chjj: yeah, compacting might get necessary at some point
[00:08] chjj: append-only is usually the way to go with dbs though, its safer, more resilient to crashes
[00:09] quackslike: lol someone put my mobile number on a car sales web site.. friggin bogans ringing me all the time.
[00:09] killfill: i guess im doing something wrong then.. its 'crashing' with not a too big db file..
[00:10] chjj: whats the error message?
[00:10] chjj: does it crash on load?

[00:35] Yuffster: This is a ridiculously edge-case scenario, but is there a way to get console.log to not replace %s with undefined?

[00:35] Postmodernist: What's the easiest way to save a really big array to disc?
[00:35] Yuffster: \%s works in Chome but not in node.
[00:36] Postmodernist: \\%s maybe
[00:36] Yuffster: Also doesn't work.
[00:36] Yuffster: (Messing in the console now.)
[00:36] Postmodernist: =(
[00:36] mscdex: killfill: try: https://gist.github.com/26091491f9caaf7d4b03
[00:36] Yuffster: It's not a huge deal, it's just that I made my test framework use console.log and these particular tests actually do replacement on %s, which means the test descriptions are messed up.
[00:37] Yuffster: It seems like it'd be silly to change the framework to use sys.puts just because of this one edge case.
[00:37] mscdex: Yuffster: that's because console.log applies formatting like printf
[00:37] Yuffster: Yeah, I know *why* it does it. :)
[00:37] mscdex: so then don't use console.log
[00:37] Yuffster: In Chrome it doesn't do it if I escape the \%s, though.
[00:37] mscdex: or monkey patch it locally
[00:38] Yuffster: Yeah, I can do that, I was just wondering if there was a way to escape it.
[00:38] mscdex: Chrome shouldn't do the printf formatting
[00:38] mscdex: afaik
[00:38] Yuffster: It does.

[00:38] mscdex: it doesn't matter if you try escaping it, because it looks for %
[00:39] Yuffster: (FYI, console.log("Put your hands up for %s.", "Detroit") in Chrome.)
[00:39] mscdex: Chrome uses some other formatting implementation
[00:39] mscdex: killfill: i dunno then, might have to bug creationix about it

[00:51] ryah: arturadib: i think the cwd 
[00:54] arturadib: ryah: makes sense, thanks.
[00:55] arturadib: ryah: I guess other than cwd, there's no other directory with precedence over ~/node_modules then?
[00:55] ryah: arturadib: $NODE_PATH
[00:56] arturadib: ryah: tried that. ~/node_modules comes first
[00:56] ryah: huh
[00:56] ryah: *shrug*
[00:56] quackquack has joined the channel
[00:57] Druide_: ahah http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhCdlygmSJ4&feature=player_embedded
[00:57] chjj: arturadib, i think you could put your modules in a node_modules dir higher up in the directory structure, but still ancestral to the requiring file
[00:57] chjj: that should take precedence if my understanding is right
[00:57] arturadib: ryah: npm now installs everything in ~/node_modules ... it makes it really tough to override an installed package with a dev version
[00:57] arturadib: :(
[00:58] chjj: so ~/dir/node_modules takes precedence over ~/node_modules for ~/dir/my/module.js
[00:58] dgathright has joined the channel
[00:59] ryah: arturadib: which version?
[01:00] stepheneb has joined the channel
[01:02] ryah2 has joined the channel
[01:02] arturadib: ryah: I mean, a new version of an arbitrary package.  say I have npm-installed several packages in ~/node_modules, but some of them are buggy.  ideally, I'd have a separate directory, say ~/node_modules-dev, where I could install more recent versions of the buggy packages
[01:03] astropirate has joined the channel
[01:03] arturadib: ryah: when the packages are fixed on npm I could just update them and remove that dev directory altogether
[01:05] ryah: arturadib: ask isaac when he's around
[01:05] arturadib: ryah: but maybe there's a more elegant solution to this problem... how do you deal with this?
[01:05] arturadib: ryah: ok
[01:05] arturadib: :)_
[01:05] arturadib: ryah: thanks
[01:05] ryah: well - node_modules is a special name
[01:05] ryah: i suspect your project is inside ~ somewhere
[01:05] k1ttty has joined the channel
[01:05] arturadib: yep.
[01:05] ryah: and require() is walking up the tree and finding node_modules
[01:06] ryah: you can get dev modules in there by putting them closer to where your code is
[01:06] ryah: e.g. ~/projects/node_modules
[01:06] arturadib: ha
[01:07] gavin_huang has joined the channel
[01:08] darshanshankar has joined the channel
[01:08] arturadib: that's probably going to do the trick, I just have to move all my Node projects to a single directory like that
[01:09] ChrisPartridge: arturadib: you have a seperate node_modules for each project
[01:09] ArtistConk has joined the channel
[01:10] arturadib: ChrisPartridge: I think I get it now. it would be nice to have a global node_modules of my choice with precedence over ~/node_modules though... at first I thought that's what require.paths was there for, so I could choose my own precedence scheme
[01:10] ryah: arturadib: we're explicitly trying to keep people from having global modules
[01:11] ryah: we consider it dangerous practice
[01:11] arturadib: ryah: got it. one set per project...
[01:11] ChrisPartridge: so you can have version X of package Z on project A and version z of package Z on project B, if required
[01:11] ChrisPartridge: s/version z/version Y/
[01:12] boogyman has joined the channel
[01:12] ChrisPartridge: arturadib: Just use npm link
[01:12] ChrisPartridge: if you have a module installed globally, and you want all projects to use it, just npm link <package>

[02:36] mikegerwitz: bobba: Consider exporting a single function (e.g. create()), which will perform your asynchronous procedure and return a new instance of a constructor, or even a basic object, via a callback. That ctor/object can contain the data you're exporting.

[02:36] bobba: mikegerwitz: Great suggestion! Thanks!!!
[02:37] mikegerwitz: bobba: Performing complex logic on require() may give the user a false sense of what's actually going on. Most don't expect require() to do much besides load exports

[03:02] Postmodernist: I'm installing five different instances of the same module
[03:03] Postmodernist: Okay, I'll have to shuffle files it around with mv then
[03:03] a|i: current dir? again?
[03:03] a|i: why is that npm changes so drastically
[03:03] Postmodernist: a|i: The changes to npm/node.js make my boss yell at me.
[03:03] a|i: package manager should install globally by default
[03:04] a|i: like any other package managers
[03:04] Postmodernist: The cute little change to current directory in npm got me fucked with executive management
[03:04] Aria: why? So apps can conflict?
[03:04] Aria: And so you can not play nice with the system's package management in addition?
[03:05] Postmodernist: Aria: If it is not global, I should be able to at least specify the directory as an option.
[03:05] a|i: you don't want many copies of many versions polluing your disk
[03:05] Postmodernist: Aria: And software won't conflict -- we're in the cloud era. Every application gets its own virtual machine.

[04:06] mikegerwitz: http://easejs.org is a nearly complete OO impl, if you need proper encapsulation (protected/private members) and such. Started creating it to make my life easier at work then it grew into its own thing. Been used in production for 6 months. Got frustrated with incomplete implementations.
[04:06] quackslike: tonymilne: cant you just if(useGetter){..} else {..}
[04:08] quackslike: mikegerwitz: holy cow! documentation! :)
[04:09] mikegerwitz: quackslike: Poor documention is a huge pet peeve of mine.
[04:09] SubStack: gross
[04:10] quackslike: mikegerwitz:i find it frustrating
[04:10] mercer has left the channel
[04:10] prettyrobots: SubStack: What's gross?
[04:11] SubStack: classical OO
[04:11] mikegerwitz: SubStack: If that's at me, OO in JS is a love or hate kind of thing ;) I personally find the prototypal model very poor for managing very large projects. Thus this library.
[04:11] mikegerwitz: classical OO*
[04:12] quackslike: mikegerwitz: i think a lot of people will like that, and the docs will make it so most people can use it fairly easily.
[04:12] quackslike: mikegerwitz: nice job all round.
[04:12] SubStack: I like tiny little libraries all doing their own thing and completely separated
[04:12] mikegerwitz: quackslike: Hopefully. I expect a lot of lashback too from people who hate classes in JS :)
[04:12] ericnakagawa has joined the channel
[04:13] quackslike: mikegerwitz: yep you'll prob get that. But noone is forcing them to use it, they will need to grow up a little bit.
[04:13] prettyrobots has joined the channel
[04:13] tiglionabbit_ has joined the channel
[04:13] prettyrobots: I use CoffeeScript to get classical OO.
[04:13] SubStack: oh I don't care that stuff like this exists, I just don't see the use of classical OO in javascript
[04:13] prettyrobots: Or Node.js sort of OO.
[04:13] SubStack: I barely use prototype-style OO
[04:14] prettyrobots: I find it useful still, to have classes.
[04:14] SubStack: using callbacks for custom behavior instead of classical inheritance is where it's at
[04:14] mikegerwitz: SubStack: Just another way of structuring your software. I find it very useful for large software.
[04:14] prettyrobots: But, I have a new way of doing things.
[04:14] mikegerwitz: SubStack: Oh, I definatly agree. I use OO in JS much like Scala uses it
[04:15] mikegerwitz: SubStack: combination of functional and classical OO
[04:15] SubStack: yeah classical OO style is occasionally useful when you want objects like Buffers that seem to pretty obviously be "things"
[04:16] SubStack: but most of the time I like to just return a hash of functions closed over some internal private state
[04:16] mikegerwitz: SubStack: OOP is excellent for separating projects into many managable pieces. Prototypes can be used to the same extend, but lack proper encapulation. When working on projects more than a few thousand lines of code, OOP greatly reduces maintetnance and development costs.
[04:16] SubStack: which is far different from how private/protected/public inheritence works in classical OO
[04:17] tiglionabbit_: SubStack: that is hard to distinguish from a class on the outside though
[04:17] mikegerwitz: extent*
[04:17] NuckingFuts: Ugh
[04:17] tiglionabbit_: mikegerwitz: if you want encapsulation, use your closure
[04:17] mikegerwitz: tiglionabbit_: that's a hack ;)
[04:17] tiglionabbit_: how is that a hack?
[04:18] SubStack: tiglionabbit_: it's pretty different because you can nest the closures arbitrarily which gives you a lot more control over the little bits of state that you need to get shit done
[04:18] SubStack: in classical OO like java or c++ those are stuck at the class root namespace
[04:18] NuckingFuts: I wish I could use ExpressJS's definition syntax for subdomains
[04:18] tiglionabbit_: mikegerwitz: I think using closures to control access is a much more elegant way to do things that designating things as "private"
[04:18] mikegerwitz: tiglionabbit_: Well, firstly, protected members cannot exist in that manner. As far as private members go, that works, but it becomes very difficult and hacky when working with multiple instances.
[04:19] SubStack: tiglionabbit_: exactly what I was getting at
[04:19] NuckingFuts: I'd kill for the ability to do ':user.example.com/'
[04:19] mikegerwitz: tiglionabbit_: If using closures, your options are to (a) declare it outside the constructor/prototype or (b) redeclare the method for each instance, within the ctor
[04:19] mikegerwitz: tiglionabbit_: Nethier are clean, or ideal.
[04:19] SubStack: mikegerwitz: but you can turn the OO model on its head and have functions that accept callbacks in order to do custom things to the internal state
[04:20] SubStack: I'm pretty uncomfortable exposing internal state to "friendly" classes
[04:20] tiglionabbit_: mikegerwitz: The way I do "classes", I make a function that returns an object.
[04:20] SubStack: because if I want to change how the internal state works those "friendly" classes need updated too
[04:20] mikegerwitz: SubStack: Classical OO simply has a different approach to the same issues.
[04:20] tiglionabbit_: if you want to do inheritance, just call another function and mess with the object it returned
[04:20] SubStack: whereas if I've got nice hooks instead I can mix up the internals all I like so long as the external interface is the same
[04:21] NuckingFuts: Any ideas of how I can lodge myself into ExpressJS such that I can modify the resource name parsing?
[04:21] SubStack: mikegerwitz: you can do much fancier footwork when you've got lambdas at your disposal
[04:21] mikegerwitz: tiglionabbit_: Yes - I'm not doing any magic with my library. That's what I have to do in the background. But after years of doing that, I found that there are better ways to organize code.

[04:21] mikegerwitz: SubStack: Classical OO doesn't prevent that ;)
[04:21] SubStack: mikegerwitz: but it gets in the way :p

[04:22] admc has joined the channel
[04:23] mikegerwitz: SubStack: Classical OO is meant to get in the way. All it does is define a set of rules that *restrict* the developer and the users.
[04:23] dgreensp: I'm using Connect -- what's this "helper" called "simpleBody" that I see in examples?  I tried calling res.simpleBody in a handler, and it doesn't exist
[04:24] NuckingFuts: dgreensp: that's a piece of MiddleWare, that parses the body of POSTed data
[04:24] NuckingFuts: And I dunno how to use it in Connect, jsut Express
[04:24] mikegerwitz: SubStack: There are many scenerios where a pure OO solution is inappropriate. I don't argue that ;) I prefer functional style myself. Different approaches.
[04:26] Nican has joined the channel
[04:26] SubStack: if you want a functional approach, all you need is functions!
[04:26] tiglionabbit_: it sure takes a while to compile nodejs

[04:26] rubydiamond has joined the channel
[04:26] dgreensp: maybe simpleBody was removed or renamed
[04:26] SubStack: to support classical oo you need all manners of additional machinery
[04:27] NuckingFuts: dgreensp: I think it's now bodyParser middleware
[04:27] SubStack: which sometimes are useful but I never really felt any of the classical oo tools were aesthetically satisfying

[04:31] pquerna: yes
[04:32] ryah: good man
[04:32] pquerna: rough profiling says 12% time in http-parser, most of it seems to be crossing the boundry/scopes
[04:32] pquerna: but if i have a little c app that goes 20x faster than node...
[04:32] ryah: how do you tell the cross boundry scopes?

[05:35] Votaguz: Aria: Let me see... the code is a sample that i get from internet... 
[05:35] Aria: It may only serve files -- if it's expecting to just open() something and send it, I'd expect it to do just what it's doing if you tell it to look at a directory.

[05:38] mscdex: node.js rules!
[05:38] Votaguz: Aria: theres no have any access to files in disk... The app only read the stream from twitter an show in a page https://github.com/yiwang/node-tweet/blob/master/tweet.js
[05:38] Aria: What are you actually running?
[05:39] Aria: What commandline?
[05:39] matyr has joined the channel
[05:39] Votaguz: In my commandline i put the following node tweet.js 
[05:40] Votaguz: And its responds " Server running at port 8000 "
[05:40] Votaguz: So i access from the browser to 127.0.0.1:8000 and get the messsage  Error: EISDIR, Is a directory
[05:40] Aria: Ah, okay. So you're running tweet.js, not one of the others.
[05:41] Votaguz: yes Aria 
[05:41] Aria: Look at the bottom there: if you request /stream, it does the twitter stuff. Otherwise it falls back to static fules.
[05:41] Aria: So if you're hitting http://127.0.0.1:8000/, not http://127.0.0.1:8000/stream, you'll get the static file handler.
[05:42] Aria: Which, you can see looks in the current directory + the uri added in the request:
[05:42] Aria: 	var filename = path.join(process.cwd(), uri);
[05:42] Aria: And it's a dumb handler: open, read, send.
[05:43] Aria: (in fact, it's really dumb, and reads the whole file into RAM to send it, rather than pumping it.)
[05:43] marknel has joined the channel
[05:43] Aria: So it's trying to read the current directory ... as a file.
[05:43] Aria: So you get that error, as you should.
[05:44] Votaguz: Aria: you are right, when i access to http://127.0.0.1:8000/stream get the following console error

[06:30] Aria: Takes a while to get used to async error passing vs exceptions.
[06:32] JackeyChan: another question, how to throw a exceptions in nodejs ?
[06:33] JackeyChan: ok i can get the answer with google
[06:33] JackeyChan: thanks 
[06:33] Aria: Sure thing. (throw exception ;-))
[06:33] sirdancealot has joined the channel
[06:33] Aria: But generally, if you're in async code, you want to pass an exception to a callback, not throw.
[06:34] JackeyChan: yes.. i think so. i can get the exception in my callback and handle it
[06:35] brettgoulder has joined the channel
[06:35] Aria: ACTION nods.
[06:35] Aria: It's that exact pattern why node hands you error as the first argument. 
[06:35] Aria: Since by the time the exception's thrown, node's code is calling your callback, and you've escaped your handler.

[07:11] AAA_awright: mscdex: XML is useful for what it was designed for
[07:11] Sidnicious: mscdex: I think it's in node-mongodb-native. When a few requests come in on top of each other (a live search field), node sometimes gets stuck and eats RAM until it segfaults.

[07:13] Sidnicious: eval for the win

[07:14] mscdex: stonevo: it does use nodejs, but the version it uses is very very old
[07:14] mscdex: stonevo: contact the author of ajaxim and tell them to update it to work with the latest stable version of node instead
[07:14] AAA_awright: mscdex: Well the XML I have on that page is just how DOAP works, but you could go with another friendlier format like Turtle or JSON-RDF

[13:10] mscdex: what's the problem?
[13:10] Visualiza: i'm a bit out of my depth though

[13:17] quackslike: i use the first way, or somethng close(node-and-npm-in-30-seconds.sh) to install on OSX (up to date though)
[13:18] Visualiza: ok i'll let you know if i get it working
[13:18] quackslike: Visualiza: i'd give the way mscdex just described a shot first..
[13:18] quackslike: Visualiza: cant you just updte your mac?
[13:18] Visualiza: installing Git was enough of a pain, but worth it in the end
[13:19] Visualiza: it's a PPC so i'd need a new one. i have an iMac running snow leapord too, but i'd like to get it working on this. as much just to help me understand Unix better

[13:22] augustl: it's pretty bad that some beginners get the impression that plain JavaScript sucks ass, and CoffeeScript is the only way to write JavaScript.
[13:22] chjj: yeah, that is a shame
[13:22] quackslike: i think for me, i just like JS - the main reason i wanted to learn node..
[13:22] augustl: other than that, I don't mind that people want to use processors
[13:22] quackslike: augustl: one thing that pisses me off is when modules i want to use are CoffeeScript - i refuse.
[13:22] chjj: js is better than people think, it just has some stupid idiosyncracies you need to get used to
[13:22] quackslike: lol
[13:23] Visualiza: well, i refactored my WebApp by changing all the JS to CS. i liked it, cut down on the LOC and made it easier for me to focus on the real problems, not little details
[13:23] adambeynon has joined the channel
[13:23] augustl: quackslike: hmm true, that haven't happened to me yet
[13:23] quackslike: chjj: yeah i'm no JS expert.. but i think it's well worth becoming one.
[13:23] chjj: quakslike, i know what you mean, i usually end up porting them to js by hand

[13:24] quackslike: ironic isnt it..
[13:24] chjj: yes
[13:24] chjj: but thats the only way i could justify learning it
[13:24] quackslike: fair enough, i guess i will learn it one day... but i wont like it ;)
[13:24] Visualiza: performance seems the same, haven't benchmarked or anything though. i'm not getting the browser to compile it for me, of course, i'm converting the code then putting the generated javascript in. i don't see why performance would change
[13:24] Mrfloyd has joined the channel
[13:25] chjj: i just dont see why people are attracted to it, if it were its own language fine, but youre compiling to a high level language
[13:25] quackslike: Visualiza: it's pretty popular.. so i guess it must have something going for it.
[13:25] Visualiza: the main attraction is high level loops

[13:39] squeeks: might be an idea to put 2.6.1 in with pythonbrew or so
[13:40] mscdex: i'd use at least 2.6

[14:30] Visualiza: meh, tried changing default python to 2.6.5 still get an error upon trying to install Node (on Mac OS 10.4). if i type node into terminal i get command not found. however, it's just possible that Node did install sufficiently and i've just not got it in my PATH or whatever. the question is, what exactly should you put in your path -- is there a specific file somewhere that launches node?

[15:55] planetic: http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/AsynchronousDefinition, has anyone used such modules from normal node modules? Such sigtanure comes from the require.js. It is a way to use them in reverse direction: I can require a "normal" module from AMD via r.js script but I can't figure out how to do it in oposite direction.

[16:51] Skola: in terms of web dev? how do you mean?

[16:52] tjholowaychuk: generalized auth usually kinda sucks but yeah there are a few connect middleware
[16:53] squeeks: draginx: I would use the best tool for the job.
[16:53] c4milo: tjholowaychuk: ++

[16:54] TroyMG: tjholowaychuk: generally agree re auth fxs, but I'm really digging everyauth
[16:54] squeeks: that way, I can just build doc/ in my npm dists from code comments
[16:54] draginx: tjholowaychuk: right but i mena like in terms of performance and scalability which would be favored?
[16:55] Skola: draginx for what?
[16:55] tjholowaychuk: squeeks: yeah totally, I'll try and make sure to add that to the next one
[16:55] TroyMG: (and specifically mongoose-auth: https://github.com/bnoguchi/mongoose-auth)

[17:01] TroyMG: pick the right tool for the job

[17:03] draginx: deedubs: https://github.com/bnoguchi/everyauth this?
[17:03] draginx: ahh yer
[17:03] TroyMG: (and if you're using MongoDB Brian's mongoose-auth is super duper)
[17:03] chjj: mongoose is a monster
[17:03] TroyMG: draginx: basicauth is the shitty auth you get popup dialogs for to enter your username/pwd
[17:03] MGT has left the channel
[17:03] deedubs: draginx TroyMG yeah that's the one.  I'm working on adding google openid+oauth hybrid in as well
[17:03] sreuter: ryah: ahh, sounds great.. at least to me :-) you have any ideas about somebody using crypto.createDecipher for binary stream decoding? like described in this post? http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs/browse_thread/thread/a1cac854f7ff319a# .. 
[17:03] draginx: deedubs: this is ur app?
[17:04] deedubs: draginx: no its not
[17:04] TroyMG: chjj: meh, mongoose isn't that bad. the author of everyauth just added adhoc schemas to mongoose a few days ago
[17:04] TroyMG: that was my big beef with it until then
[17:05] TroyMG: (besides the fact that the NPM published version - 1.3.3 - is horribly broken)
[17:05] chjj: mongoose just seems so heavyweight, id rather just use mongo-db-native if i were using mongo
[17:05] draginx: deedubs: it seems like it *has* to use mongoos? O_o cant use mysq
[17:05] deedubs: ACTION runs to check mongoose version
[17:05] deedubs: draginx: wrong
[17:05] deedubs: It doesn't care how the user objects are stored and returned
[17:05] chjj: draginx: whered you get that idea?
[17:06] deedubs: draginx: you write your own findOrCreateUser
[17:06] draginx: express helpers on the wiki
[17:06] TroyMG: draginx: mongoose-auth is an implementation of everyauth using mongoose
[17:06] draginx: right
[17:06] TroyMG: you could use everyauth with whatever
[17:06] deedubs: which could use pigeons if you use promises and not sync
[17:06] TroyMG: mysql, flatfile
[17:06] chjj: flat files for life
[17:06] chjj: whos with me!
[17:06] chjj: ...
[17:06] TroyMG: chjj: the problem with mongo-db-native is how do you add functionality to your models?
[17:06] bruce has joined the channel
[17:06] TroyMG: you end up rebuilding half of mongoose
[17:07] nadirvardar has joined the channel
[17:07] chjj: exactly, half
[17:07] TroyMG: when you want methods on your model
[17:07] indutny has joined the channel
[17:07] chjj: that means that at least half of mongoose is useless bloat, by your own concession
[17:07] deedubs: ...
[17:07] deedubs: 1/2 is adding functionality to your models
[17:08] deedubs: 1/64 is validations
[17:08] TroyMG: it wasn't exactly a scientific measurement, but yes, I'll concede that when using a library you often pull down stuff you don't need
[17:08] deedubs: 1/256 is callbacks
[17:08] deedubs: 1/1024 might be plugins
[17:08] deedubs: I'm sure we can add this up to 
[17:08] deedubs: 1
[17:08] matbee: Also, on Webos their apps don't support websockets--- but the new webos 2.x include node.js... Is it possible to connect to another node websocket via node?
[17:08] TroyMG: deedubs: what in mongoose is it that you never ever need?
[17:08] TroyMG: virtuals? static methods?
[17:08] deedubs: TroyMG: I'm agreeing with you, sorry
[17:09] deedubs: I quite enjoy mongoose
[17:09] TroyMG: ah
[17:09] TroyMG: I should've addressed that at chjj then :-)
[17:09] TroyMG: mongoose is mostly a wrapper around mongodb-native now anyway

[18:35] tbranyen: mozilla treats their engines like a personal sandbox

[18:39] tbranyen: although some stuff like mozilla object proxying looks so fucking amazing i wish v8 had it right now

[19:42] syskk: why is global bad? seriously
[19:42] Aikar: Nodemonster: your boss should be HAPPY tho, globals are harder to deploy
[19:43] Nodemonster: The IT goons tried to deploy with the new version of npm and we ended up with a S.O. compliance system that silently failed.
[19:43] Aikar: because when you checkout your project, you shouldnt then have to npm install dependencies, and then worry bout versioning
[19:43] Aikar: and you shouldnt need npm to deploy your code either
[19:43] Aikar: code for your project should be in your SCM
[19:44] Nodemonster: Aikar: I always use a different VPS guest for each node app anyway, but local is find now that I can expect it.
[19:44] syskk: right. what about native extensions with a build script? should the binary be versioned?
[19:45] Aikar: syskk: modules with helper binaries are able to be installed globally,
[19:45] addisonj: this is the weirdest thing, bash is freaking out on my about a relative path, don't have any symlinks to mess it up, bash just doesn't like it apparently
[19:45] Aikar: or install locally and reference its local bin
[19:46] Nodemonster: Why did the developers choose to go local dependencies -> global dependencies -> then back to local?
[19:46] Aikar: because anyone who works profesionally as a developer should know local is the right way
[19:47] Aikar: your code should be tied to SCM
[19:47] c4milo: hey does npm have support to specify the url in some dependencies? 
[19:47] killing-joke has joined the channel
[19:47] c4milo: like rubygems
[19:48] Nodemonster: Aikar: Absolutely, but why did they go global in the first place?
[19:48] Aikar: Nodemonster: idunno, prolly due to stuff like rubygems who do it that way
[19:48] Aikar: but im glad ry didnt take node down the path to be like gems
[19:49] Nodemonster: :)
[19:49] Aikar: "to use our software you need to install node, and <lists 30 modules> from npm, then you can run it"
[19:49] Aikar: that design is lame for deployment and management
[19:49] Aikar: simply having all your code in SCM "just works great"
[19:50] killing-joke: hi. is there a tool i can use at the command line to load an entire page (all assets), execute all js, and give me timestamps for each asset?
[19:50] Nodemonster: Aikar: npm does software configuration management?
[19:50] drudge: Aikar: that's what a package.json and dependencies are for
[19:50] killing-joke: i have tried phantomjs, and maybe i could write something for it that would be close.
[19:50] Aikar: want to update a ver of your dep? checkout branch, run the upgrade locally, test it, commit it, integration test it, merge
[19:51] Nodemonster: You're all in the past. Software deployment isn't done that way anymore. We're in the cloud era.

[19:56] MrNibbles: anyone here from poland? Im heading to falsyvalues on wed, need a bit of advice
[19:57] Aikar: npm module installs should be treated just like a git submodule (except that its better to a degree that its not a submodule so your not relying on an external repo being up. npm install foo && git add node_modules/foo && git commit. then when its time to update, git branch, npm update foo, test, git add node_modules/foo && git commit

[20:17] baudehlo: a|i: seems to be a few using message queues.
[20:18] a|i: baudehlo: message queues replacing pubsub?
[20:18] mraleph: ryah: I have an interesting observation for you about that infamous and sad comparison with erlang. If I throttle accept (i.e. accept return after 50 accepted connections from https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/net.js#L907 then response rate seems to improve by 20-30% and number of errors drops. 
[20:18] baudehlo: haven't they always?
[20:18] baudehlo: a|i: https://github.com/squaremo/rabbit.js
[20:19] ryah: mraleph: interesting
[20:19] mjr_: mraleph: I figured it was something like that
[20:19] ryah: do you think we're blocked on accepting?
[20:19] kersny has joined the channel
[20:19] ryah: that's an easy fix
[20:19] a|i: baudehlo: any ideas which approach is more efficient?
[20:19] AsDfGh1231 has joined the channel
[20:19] mjr_: Every time I've looked at node performance, it always goes into some kind of concurrency explosion and needs some kind of throttling.
[20:19] baudehlo: in qpsmtpd I had the accept queue automatically ramp up and down.
[20:20] mraleph: well connections arrive in batches like 100 − 200 connections per call to that function.
[20:20] baudehlo: might be worth stealing.
[20:20] mraleph: sometimes it takes upto 30ms to process all of them
[20:20] onar has joined the channel
[20:20] ryah: i wonder if there's a smart way to choose when to stop

[20:20] dnyy has joined the channel
[20:21] ryah: mraleph: yeah, that's interesting
[20:21] baudehlo: ryah: here's what I do in qpsmtpd: https://github.com/smtpd/qpsmtpd/blob/master/qpsmtpd-async#L375
[20:21] dnyy: is this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4871932/using-npm-to-install-or-update-required-packages-just-like-bundler-for-rubygems (first answer) the standard way of doing it?
[20:21] chapel: those brute force testers aren't very realistic either
[20:22] baudehlo: ryah: the basic idea is that we want to balance getting back to the main loop with accepting as much as we can.
[20:22] chapel: has anyone thought of using node to build a reddit/digg simulator?
[20:22] mraleph: I am curious what will happen if you put more meat into request handler.
[20:22] ryah: baudehlo: i'd think the timer would be unnecessary
[20:22] chapel: where it could span over multiple servers and hit one target?
[20:22] mjr_: baudehlo: that's interesting.  How do you know when to slow it down?
[20:23] ryah: baudehlo: you just want to get back to processing other sockets and not stuck in a accept loop
[20:23] mraleph: like fetching file or image or something from fs, or rendering a template, etc.

[20:23] tdegrunt has joined the channel
[20:23] baudehlo: mjr_: it's imperfect.
[20:24] baudehlo: it needs down-throttling as well as up-throttling.
[20:24] mjr_: I see.  Tricky problem.
[20:24] baudehlo: right now if there's no more connections in 30 seconds it resets it back to 20.
[20:24] perezd: anyone in here using RQueue?
[20:24] ryah: i wonder if libev priorities could be used here...
[20:25] baudehlo: I tried a bunch of different methods and that just seemed to work without too much hassle.
[20:25] ryah: like give accept fd high priority but decrement it each time you accept a connection in a loop
[20:25] ryah: or something..
[20:25] tjholowaychuk: quackquack: nope
[20:25] quackquack: tjholowaychuk: k, thx
[20:26] mjr_: Honestly, I think node performance is "fine" for now.  
[20:26] tjholowaychuk: dont have a express logo either
[20:26] tjholowaychuk: some day
[20:26] baudehlo: ryah: I think just have a maximum number of accept() calls is a good first step
[20:26] mjr_: Lots of bugs out there that are more important IMO than beating Erlang.
[20:26] baudehlo: agreed.
[20:26] mraleph: ryah: I also still see that V8 goes to runtime for some properties like 'emit', '_headers' and some others pretty often. but that does not seem to be the bottleneck. it tried fighting it by changing code here and there, but it had no effect. so I think the main overhead is in something else
[20:26] ryah: mjr_ definitely
[20:26] chapel: mjr_: I don't think its to beat erlang, but ryah has always wanted node to be fast
[20:27] mraleph: bugs are always important more than anything else
[20:27] baudehlo: For Haraka which is entirely unoptimised it's already as fast as a competitor's C smtp server (that using async i/o).
[20:27] ryah: especially since im in the middle of  the network rewrite from hell

[21:11] v8bot: andi5: substack/node-browserify - GitHub - https://github.com/substack/node-browserify
[21:11] andi5: chapel: I have created a stable branch of Yabble
[21:12] chapel: just saying, since browserify allows you to use commonjs modules in the browser
[21:12] andi5: chapel: How does load modules. I prefer script tags, no eval()
[21:13] andi5: My workflow is even creazier
[21:13] tbranyen: no mine is crayzeeer
[21:13] andi5: One codebase, but strip out the serverside code etc.
[21:13] mscdex: no mine is!
[21:13] tbranyen: andi5: i don't get the point of that stuff
[21:14] tbranyen: unified codebase seems kind of dumb
[21:14] tbranyen: sharing stuff liek templates and contexts around thats cool
[21:14] andi5: tbranyen: It works very well
[21:14] andi5: I don't want to miss it
[21:14] chapel: andi5: well browserify just takes your commonjs module and includes it in the browser side js file
[21:14] robhawkes has joined the channel
[21:14] chapel: and has code that makes require work
[21:14] tbranyen: andi5: i doubt it, its hard enough to share stuff like templates correctly between the browser and the client, i can't imagine sharing an entire codebase
[21:14] tbranyen: server and client are so different
[21:14] chapel: tbranyen: browserify :P
[21:14] chapel: works great
[21:14] andi5: Let's take a look i browserifiy support require.ensure()
[21:14] mscdex: dnode!
[21:14] tbranyen: chapel: i mean philosophically
[21:15] tbranyen: they do different things
[21:15] andi5: tbranyen: It works
[21:15] chapel: yeah tbranyen
[21:15] andi5: Believe me, it's slick
[21:15] chapel: I think it is case by case
[21:15] chapel: sometimes its just right
[21:15] chapel: sometimes its not worth forcing it
[21:15] andi5: A client-side controller is in the smae way a module like node module
[21:15] andi5: chapel: I would suggest ir for more complex projects
[21:16] andi5: dnode is great
[21:16] tbranyen: andi5: well i look forward to you changing the world and me sulking for being a laggard
[21:16] andi5: tbranyen: They are not that different. But you should NEVER expect that you can share the code
[21:17] tbranyen: but as of right now i reserve my doubts
[21:17] chapel: but stuff like browserify makes it much easier
[21:17] tbranyen: since i've done a shit load of work on sharing templates and object contexts between the client and the server and already thats ridiculously hard to get right
[21:17] tbranyen: especially trying to keep it not a waste of time
[21:17] tbranyen: chapel: yea i can agree with that
[21:17] andi5: It's just because of node's awesomeness
[21:17] chapel: tbranyen: depending on what templating engine you use, it doesn't have to be hard
[21:17] tbranyen: chapel: how do you deal with partials?
[21:17] chapel: specially when they can be precompiled
[21:17] tbranyen: do you ajax them every single time?
[21:17] fakewaffle: How do I see the message in req.flash(...) in express?
[21:17] chapel: eh, I haven't done much of it
[21:17] chapel: tbh
[21:18] tbranyen: andi5: i was working with spine.js and thought it would be cool to share the codebase for no-script fall backs
[21:18] chapel: fakewaffle: add it in your template
[21:18] tbranyen: but as i was working with it, i realzied it just wasn't worth it
[21:18] chapel: fakewaffle: http://japhr.blogspot.com/2010/08/expressjs-flash.html
[21:18] hij1nx: anyone know how to combine a passphrase and a cert for the options passed to https.createServer?
[21:18] andi5: Probably I will release the package soon, strips server code, packs modules into one file, but you can load modules independently as well
[21:19] fakewaffle: chapel: thanks man!

[21:20] andi5: See requireJS, this is too big
[21:20] nrajlich: ACTION want's to know my nickname...
[21:20] chapel: well browserify is more than a loader
[21:21] andi5: I see, I like the idea to reuse node functionality
[21:22] yozgrahame: does anyone have code examples of the same code running on client and/or server? Where the code itself makes the decision where to run.
[21:22] yozgrahame: I mean, something substantial.
[21:23] yozgrahame: or maybe I'm misunderstanding.
[21:23] chapel: I think you are
[21:23] andi5: yozgrahame: Code never decides where it runs
[21:23] chapel: its very rare that you could use the exact same code on server and browser
[21:23] chjj: agree^
[21:23] chapel: just because they have different things involved
[21:23] yozgrahame: andi5: I mean, there's some control code that decides where the templating and such are run
[21:23] chjj: two different ballparks

[21:36] chapel: its only transferable if people will take it

[21:38] chapel: well, sure ryah, but that is the deathknel
[21:38] tjholowaychuk: kkaefer: just add a middleware at the bottom
[21:38] tjholowaychuk: and implement your own 404
[21:38] tjholowaychuk: or throw within there
[21:38] tjholowaychuk: well next(err) would be better but yeah
[21:38] robotarmy has joined the channel
[21:38] kkaefer: that's what I have, but I kind of feel like a 404 should end up in an error

[21:38] tjholowaychuk: there are no more middlware (including error handling middleware) to handle it

[21:39] tjholowaychuk: unless we special-case 404s / 500s etc
[21:39] tjholowaychuk: but im not interested in that

[21:41] tjholowaychuk: just do app.use(function(res, res){ res.send({ message: 'oh noes 404!' }); })

[21:42] kkaefer: thanks, tjholowaychuk
[21:42] tjholowaychuk: np let me know if it doesnt work out the way you want
[21:43] kkaefer: ah, erroHandler always returns 500
[21:43] kkaefer: basically what I'm doing is to channel all errors (>= 400) through next(err)
[21:44] kkaefer: and then send the error with the status code if the object has a "status" property
[21:44] mamund: fwiw, i need to have 4xx and 5xx status codes return XML or JSON bodies, too.
[21:44] kkaefer: https://github.com/developmentseed/bones/blob/master/server/middleware.js#L32-52
[21:44] tjholowaychuk: kkaefer: the thing is that
[21:44] tjholowaychuk: app.error() etc
[21:44] tjholowaychuk: are really just middleware
[21:44] tjholowaychuk: might be a bit confusing i guess since they appear to be special-cased
[21:44] tjholowaychuk: which might be an argument to remove them
[21:44] jet18 has joined the channel
[21:45] kkaefer: app.error callbacks take err as the first parameter though
[21:45] kkaefer: so they /are/ kind of special
[21:45] kkaefer: and they always seem to run last
[21:45] tjholowaychuk: nope
[21:45] tjholowaychuk: app.use(function(err, req, res, next){})
[21:45] tjholowaychuk: is the error handling sig
[21:45] kkaefer: oh, it introspects the function it gets passed?
[21:45] tjholowaychuk: when there is an error *only* those with an arity of 4
[21:45] tjholowaychuk: are executed
[21:46] tjholowaychuk: but still in order of definition
[21:46] tjholowaychuk: app.error() basically just wraps with a closure so that the arity can be < 4
[21:46] tjholowaychuk: and express does a bit of fiddling to make sure they are at the bottom
[21:47] tjholowaychuk: I believe what I have right now is that the error handlers via app.error() are not even added to the app until "listening" is emitted
[21:47] tjholowaychuk: to ensure they are last
[21:47] kkaefer: will it keep the middleware at the bottom?

[21:51] ryah: question. what should be the behavior here:

[21:52] ryah: true
[21:52] ryah: what about b[1] ?
[21:52] kkaefer: b[1] should be undefined
[21:52] ryah: ACTION agrees
[21:52] kkaefer: undefined not as in JS' undefined but as in non-defined behavior
[21:52] kkaefer: or rather
[21:53] kkaefer: whatever the buffer had in it before the b.write()
[21:53] ryah: binary encoding is one byte per character

[22:35] Guest75743 has joined the channel
[22:35] chjj: if its a regular synchronous loop doing some regular synchronous stuff, it will always block until its done

[22:37] mikeal has joined the channel
[22:38] mcmx5: its just counting at the moment just as a test.
[22:38] chjj: well if youre doing for (var i = 0xfffffffffff; i--;); that might block for a while
[22:38] chjj: but normally you wouldnt have gigantic loops like that in production
[22:39] chjj: the synchronous stuff you do in node should ideally be minimal
[22:39] mcmx5: what i really want is x amount of clients to connect to /, and wait until another client goes /send and then they all print out some content
[22:40] mcmx5: i can't seem to find a straight forward enough example

[22:42] chjj: it just abstracts them all away

[22:46] ryah: and say that there is a maximum connections per agent
[22:46] sreuter1: no, xhr-longpoll doesnt work great trough reverse-proxies.. at least, thats what i learned from my last experience.. ended up with a special ha-proxy configuration, very special / long timeouts… and stunnel, because ha-proxy doesnt support ssl……. after all, i throw everything away and build my own lib with basically just polls a resource on the server every 5 seconds... 
[22:46] mcmx5: to be honest, i am a bit worried about the concurrency issue. From what i gather, callbacks are kind of concurrent?
[22:47] zeade has joined the channel
[22:48] tmzt has joined the channel
[22:50] chjj: mcmx5: i dont know what kind of concurrent means, node/libeio/libuv manages a thread pool to make normally blocking calls asynchronous, so all you have to do is give a callback - node is one thread, but one thread can serve you well when it doesnt have to wait on io
