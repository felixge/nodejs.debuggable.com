If I do, though, and in 6 months I don't have the time to hack in feature X for them, am I dooming them to not being able to find someone else to work on it?

[00:40] warz: hi all. how do i see which path node is using for node_path? the path that npm is installing to, and the path that node is looking in are not the same.
[00:40] warz: its probably because of an older version, or something.

[08:18] bosphorus has joined the channel

[08:22] kazupon has joined the channel

[10:53] guybrush: mmalecki: i think this issue is related https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/2254

[10:55] guybrush: forking a fork of the forked fork?
[10:55] konobi: mmalecki: generally you need to dup(2) open file handles during a fork anyway
[10:55] eldios: guybrush, you do have the right nickname XD
[10:56] mmalecki: konobi: right, the problem is that the forked process seems totally fucked

[10:56] konobi: mmalecki: you're telling libev/uv that you've forked?

[11:35] JasonSmith: The day after I wrote a traceback module, I immediately used it to track down setTimeout leaks
[11:37] JasonSmith: Now I'm thinking of moving that to a "valgrind for setTimeout" module. It tells you all your timeouts in-flight, what function/file:line-no number set it, and what function/file:line-no cleared it
[11:37] JasonSmith: Y'all think that would be a worthwhile module? Or does it exist?

[11:39] JasonSmith: Do you know offhand if I replace global.setTimeout, would that affect all calls from any other code in the process (subsequently)?
[11:40] josephg: I think I tried that at one point, and it didn't
[11:40] josephg: but that sounds pretty easy to test
[11:40] JasonSmith: Like, how can I $LD_PRELOAD, you know? To make sure all my timeouts and intervals are accounted for
[11:40] Lingerance: It'd affect any modules, but not REPL (which has a seperate global)
[11:41] josephg: aah that old chestnut
[11:41] JasonSmith: Of course if you are willing to run <blah tester> mycode.js then there may be an AST rewriter already doing this
[11:41] JasonSmith: AST rewriters can do anything. At Zombocom.

[13:10] dominiques has joined the channel
[13:10] Bioxyde: how can I stop node from running it
[13:10] Bioxyde: without closing terminal?
[13:10] dominiques: hello everybody
[13:11] Lingerance: CTRL+C
[13:11] dominiques: has anyone experiences with proxying ndoe servers behind apache?
[13:11] Bioxyde: Ah
[13:11] Bioxyde: Thanks
[13:11] Bioxyde: :P
[13:11] Lingerance: Why Apache?
[13:11] dominiques: Because i have an apache server running
[13:11] mhauri has joined the channel
[13:11] dominiques: and my clients sit behind a firewall, that doesn't allow other ports than 80 
[13:11] Lingerance: Eitherway, it'd be the same as any other httpd.
[13:12] augustl: haproxy is better for proxying node since it's more generic
[13:12] augustl: haproxy can be TCP instead of http for example
[13:12] dominiques: i only need http
[13:13] augustl: yeah but apache has conventions for how it handles connections etc that might not match what your node app expects
[13:13] dominiques: uffa, haproxy seems like a boeing 747
[13:13] ph^ has joined the channel
[13:13] dominiques: can you be more precise?
[13:13] garrensmith has joined the channel
[13:13] augustl: dominiques: both apache and node will try to handle connection reuse across requests for example
[13:14] zomg: dominiques: I'm using varnish to run node/apache in port 80
[13:14] zomg: seems to work pretty nicely
[13:14] augustl: dominiques: these are just things to be aware of though, it may work just fine to have apache talk to your node app
[13:14] zmbmartin has joined the channel
[13:15] vkareh has joined the channel
[13:15] dominiques: augustl: ok thanks
[13:15] dominiques: zomg: i'll try that!
[13:15] zomg: Basically what I'm doing is varnish sits on port 80
[13:16] zomg: Apache runs on another port, and node runs on another port as well.
[13:16] zomg: Varnish then just forwards any connections to the respective servers based on the domain name
[13:16] dominiques: oh damn... ok, can't do this change right now. Is there no possibility to do with apache rewrites?
[13:16] zomg: It might work if you use the proxy thing in mod_rewrite
[13:16] zomg: you also need mod_proxy I think
[13:16] Lingerance: You can't do it with rewrites, you have to use mod_proxy.
[13:16] zomg: I haven't used that specific feature myself though
[13:17] dominiques: Lingerance: Ok, no prob mod_proxy is already there (doing the same thing with couchdb already)
[13:18] Brandon_R: what is node proxy good for
[13:18] Brandon_R: i see nowjs uses it
[13:19] TheJH: Brandon_R, make objects that look like ordinary object but that don't have real JS objects behind them
[13:19] augustl: dominiques: mod_proxy indeed
[13:19] Brandon_R: kool
[13:19] TheJH: Brandon_R, nowjs uses one big in-RAM object or so to represent all the stuff in the "magic box"
[13:20] Juan77 has joined the channel
[13:20] TheJH: Brandon_R, of course, this doesn't work on the client
[13:20] Brandon_R: do you use nowjs?
[13:20] Brandon_R: i can see some pretty useful applications for this
[13:20] Brandon_R: like multiplayer games
[13:20] fe: has anyone tries to run node.js on IIS ? (or maybe not even try..)
[13:20] TheJH: Brandon_R, so while changes on the server get pushed immediately, changes on the client need ~0.5s to be discovered by some ugly polling logic
[13:20] augustl: fe: IIS can proxy
[13:20] TheJH: Brandon_R, I prefer dnode
[13:20] augustl: it's called "rewrite" on IIS just to fuck you up
[13:21] fe: heh
[13:22] fe: thnx
[13:22] TheJH: Brandon_R, because of that polling stuff and because afaik dnode has the better callback garbage collection stuff if you use my patch
[13:22] Brandon_R: which patch?
[13:22] CarterL has joined the channel
[13:22] TheJH: Brandon_R, https://github.com/substack/dnode/pull/75 and https://github.com/substack/dnode-protocol/pull/8

[13:24] dominiques: hei good news! using mod_proxy works FANTASTIC!
[13:24] fe: augustl: can you refer me to documentation about node.js on IIS ?
[13:24] zomg: Cool
[13:24] TheJH: Brandon_R, both nowjs and dnode use socket.io
[13:24] derpeter: hi. can somebody tell me how to set the working dir in the option argument for spawn a new process. couldnt find the syntax in the documentation
[13:24] zomg: Had to fiddle with varnish a bit in order to get socketio working properly w/ it
[13:25] Brandon_R: oh so it's just another layer on the socket.io stack
[13:25] Brandon_R: i will have to check this out
[13:25] Brandon_R: socket.io is my all time favorite module

[14:35] alFReD-NSH: the image sucks :P
[14:35] alFReD-NSH: n no tests
[14:35] Aikar: thats not necessarirly true, someone  could write bad tests and still be buggy!
[14:35] alFReD-NSH: well at least there are some tests
[14:35] Aikar: and they checked in only .coffee files for examples
[14:35] Aikar: wheres the .js?
[14:35] alFReD-NSH: no js
[14:36] alFReD-NSH: u have to compile it urself!

[14:36] augustl: Aikar: what are you saying? I don't believe you

[17:16] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: that's pretty much what we do with our ghetto solution. however, to daemonize (push process to the background) we'd have to kill current process. with regular fork we can continue from where we left off.

[18:24] isaacs: gzmask: i'm not sure i get what you're saying.  npm already does that for you.

[18:39] Aikar: if foo depends on bar, and a minor update to bar breaks foo, and foo author is away, now the user has to track down what ver of bar works and manually install it?
[18:40] isaacs: Aikar: it's best to use reasonable dependency ranges.
[18:40] isaacs: ~ is usually good.
[18:40] isaacs: it is a measure of trust in the dependency author
[18:40] zheneva has joined the channel
[18:40] isaacs: Aikar: how many times has that happened to you?
[18:40] Aikar: isaacs: yes but even a minor update may pass all tests of your own, but could still break other peoples code who depend on it
[18:40] isaacs: Aikar: sure
[18:40] dennisjbell has joined the channel
[18:40] isaacs: Aikar: how many times has that ever happened, though?  i mean, really?
[18:40] Aikar: isaacs: none :P but your boss isnt going to care 'this never happened before!' when it does bite you
[18:41] Aikar: and also, one of your deps could have deps that they put too wide of a range of versioning
[18:41] toopay has joined the channel
[18:41] isaacs: compared wiht the number of times that people have "fake" failures, where something refuses to install, or updating to fix a bug is impossible, which happens all the time.
[18:41] Aikar: and their module could be broken by their dependencies, which in turn breaks yours
[18:41] neilk_ has joined the channel

[18:43] maikomjames: I am starting with Node.js Would you like a simple example of connecting to mysql. Would anyone help me?
[18:43] isaacs: Aikar: because distribution is to humans, not machines.
[18:44] isaacs: Aikar: they can figure it out.  machines are much stupider.
[18:44] Aikar: isaacs: depends on the human :P

[18:45] bingomanatee: <-- has watched "The Terminator" too many times.
[18:45] prettyrobots has joined the channel
[18:45] Aikar: user prolly can work it out, but why should they need to? 
[18:45] Aikar: if foo just distributes the tested version of bar, it removes the possibility
[18:45] patrickgamer has left the channel
[18:46] Aikar: what gain do you really get from making bar a loose dep
[18:46] isaacs: Aikar: because fixing edge cases that never happens instead of fixing the 99% use case is not what npm is about.
[18:46] isaacs: Aikar: here's an example:  let's say your app depends on semver.
[18:47] maikomjames: I am starting with Node.js Would you like a simple example of connecting to mysql. Would anyone help me?
[18:47] isaacs: and you depend on ~1.0.11, because that's the version that you dev against.
[18:47] isaacs: that means, give me at least 1.0.11, but less than 1.1.0

[18:50] jaha has joined the channel
[18:50] isaacs: Aikar: and your user posts a bug to you, saying "Why isn't the '1' version range satisfied by 1.0.0-beta?  and why is ~v1.2.3 an invalid version range?"
[18:50] isaacs: Aikar: but you'er away.
[18:51] isaacs: Aikar: yes, they *could* work out that it's a semver bug, and then update semver, except your app *still* won't use that one, because you told npm not to let it.
[18:51] mehlah has joined the channel
[18:51] isaacs: Aikar: basically, you're saying, "No, I *specifically need that bug to be there*"

[18:52] Aikar: ok yeah things like that can be resolved
[18:52] isaacs: Aikar: but the point is, for any "ALWAYS DO X!!"  type rule regarding software dependency management (including this one) it's not very hard to find an exception.
[18:52] Aikar: but that scenario could go in reverse

[19:32] TimTimTim: thanks, just wanted to make sure i wasn't overlooking something
[19:32] JustinCampbell: can someone maybe help me with refactoring some code?
[19:32] JustinCampbell: i'm writing a daemon
[19:32] Raynos: When navigating the node lib source code how do you track require's like https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/module.js#L22 ?
[19:32] JustinCampbell: and its just squashed on the global namespace
[19:32] JustinCampbell: and id like to learn how to do it properly
[19:32] Raynos: I cant find native_module.js
[19:33] TimTimTim: oh one more question... should i use readFileSync or readFile for the JSON.parse?
[19:33] tbranyen: depends if you read only on the start of the app
[19:33] Raynos: always readFile 
[19:33] tbranyen: might as well just make it sync
[19:34] TimTimTim: readFileSync if i expect the file to possibly be changed at any time right?
[19:34] Raynos: readFile if you expect the file to change
[19:34] Raynos: you must not use sync methods when the server is running
[19:34] tbranyen: wat...
[19:34] tbranyen: oh you mean to reload it later

[19:39] Toin3: Do you have a sample and basic webserver made with libuv which can parse a html page ? 
[19:40] ryah: parsing html is hard
[19:40] mmalecki: hah!
[19:40] ryah: Toin3: you should use node
[19:40] ryah: Toin3: there's a few modules to parse html

[19:42] caolanm: isaacs: thanks for your stdin fixes in node 0.6.6, it fixed some issues for me, but I still have a problem if I call my getPassword function twice, can you see any glaring errors in the way I'm doing this? https://github.com/kanso/kanso/blob/master/src/kanso/utils.js#L425-455

The Mongoose documentation says, "Mongoose interacts with your embedded documents in arrays atomically, out of the box." But what does this really mean? If two clients both try pulling entries from the queue at the same time, does Mongoose do something to handle that? Is a find(...) ... save() pair somehow guaranteed to be atomic?

[22:05] djbell has joined the channel
[22:06] megalomix: secoif, https://gist.github.com/1483122
[22:07] secoif: megalomix you should be using npm install -g n for starters
[22:07] secoif: see if that changes the error
[22:07] isaacs: megalomix: whoa, what kind of node is that?
[22:07] megalomix: no
[22:07] isaacs: that error should not happen
[22:07] megalomix: same error
[22:08] isaacs: megalomix: nono, that's a libuv thing.  that's deep magic.
[22:08] isaacs: megalomix: how'd you install node?

[22:08] megalomix: with n
[22:08] pquerna: on twitter i always want to us #node.js, but then twitter never links it right, so then i write #nodejs, but it feels all funny.
[22:08] isaacs: megalomix: can you *un*install it with n, and then install it normally somewhere?
[22:08] megalomix: ok i do one thing
[22:08] lduros has left the channel
[22:08] isaacs: pquerna: use @nodejs
[22:08] megalomix: format c:
[22:08] isaacs: on twitter.
[22:08] megalomix: ahahahah
[22:08] megalomix: :)
[22:08] megalomix: i remove all
[22:08] megalomix: node and n
[22:08] isaacs: pquerna: @nodejs is the actual thing.
[22:08] megalomix: and npm
[22:09] megalomix: and i reinstall all again
[22:09] secoif: megalomix good idea
[22:09] isaacs: megalomix: that should work.
[22:09] isaacs: megalomix: if you install node 0.6.5, you'll get a recent npm along with it
[22:09] isaacs: latest and greatest, in fact

[22:09] megalomix: one moment isaacs 
[22:10] megalomix: i have to install N
[22:10] secoif: TimTimTim what do you want to access? most of the time if you'd normally do connect.X then do express.X
[22:10] megalomix: then the last node version
[22:10] megalomix: and i will get npm automatically ?
[22:10] TimTimTim: i'm trying to access sessions from within sockets
[22:10] secoif: megalomix I'd install node before I installed n
[22:10] isaacs: megalomix: you don't have to install n, but that's optional

[22:10] reid has joined the channel
[22:11] megalomix: isaacs, i know...i use n for comodity
[22:11] isaacs: megalomix: personally? i use nave for subshells with specific versions, then keep the latest and greatest node in the default location /usr/local
[22:11] TimTimTim: i need the user's session id to pull the session data from redis
[22:11] sven-s has left the channel
[22:11] megalomix: ok so what are the steps ?

[22:11] kenperkins: just noticed that we were seeing asserts in what we thought was the retail build
[22:11] isaacs: megalomix: what operating system?
[22:11] kenperkins: how should i check that
[22:12] secoif: TimTimTim you'd do that from within a request wouldn't you? It's probably just req.session
[22:12] megalomix: ubuntu 11.10
[22:12] megalomix: isaacs, ubuntu 11.10
[22:12] TimTimTim: i'm trying to do it from within a socket connection, not a request
[22:12] petrjanda has joined the channel

[22:13] StanlySoManly has joined the channel
[22:14] dgathright has joined the channel
[22:14] TimTimTim: well the socket id's change on reconnect, which is why i need to get the user's "connect.sid" cookie
[22:15] megalomix: isaacs, ?
[22:15] TimTimTim: i don't have connect installed but i do have express installed... and i know express is built on top of connect so it would seem silly to install connect too just to parse the cookies
[22:15] dgathright_ has joined the channel
[22:15] TimTimTim: maybe i should look into express's source code or something lol :|
[22:16] isaacs: megalomix: ok, get the source from here, then: http://nodejs.org/#download
[22:16] franciscallo has joined the channel
[22:16] isaacs: megalomix: download the tarball, crack it open, ./configure && make && sudo make install
[22:16] isaacs: megalomix: that'll give you node and npm
[22:16] secoif: TimTimTim when you say sockets, are you talking about socketio or net.Socket
[22:16] megalomix: isaacs, but n, nave and nvm are not good to install node ?
[22:16] isaacs: megalomix: then, `sudo npm install nave -g` or `sudo npm install n -g`, or whatever.
[22:16] megalomix: isaacs, why after ?
[22:16] isaacs: megalomix: well, you used n, and that died.  i don't support n :)
[22:17] isaacs: megalomix: because it's best to have some node available all the time, even outside of a nave subshell
[22:17] isaacs: megalomix: but, you CAN get the nave script, drop it in the PATH somewhere, and just use that always
[22:17] megalomix: ok
[22:17] megalomix: i will do that

[22:38] wiwillia: substack want you to sign off on this reduced color version of your art
[22:38] secoif: ryah make sure you include the #mejorandola tag so it appears in that feed in his stream
[22:39] megalomix: isaacs, now how can i use 0.6.6 for each new shell ?
[22:39] megalomix: i can set my default version ?
[22:39] megalomix: *can i set....
[22:40] isaacs: megalomix: you have to type `nave use <version>` to enter that env
[22:40] isaacs: megalomix: you can use `nave usemain <version>` to install it globally, but that'll  require sudo.  you'll need to configure sudo to preserve the environment.
[22:40] isaacs: megalomix: man sudo; man visudo

[22:44] mnutt has joined the channel
[22:44] joshsmith: I'm not fully sure I understand how the two work together
[22:45] shapeshed_: backbone doesn't care about the backend
[22:45] joshsmith: my main concerns right now are: 1) cleaning up client-side code organization, and 2) reducing the amount of HTML markup used
[22:46] joshsmith: i.e. no more .append('<some complex html>' + randomVar + '</some complex html>')
[22:46] shapeshed_: there are a few example projects on GH I think

[22:48] brianc1: joshsmith: I don't think backbone will help much with the 2nd concern directly, but it will help you integrate with a client-side templating library of your choice 
[22:49] isaacs: megalomix: that's weird.  try this:  nave clean 0.6.6; nave usemain 0.6.6
[22:49] colinclark has joined the channel
[22:49] joshsmith: brianc1: hmm, I thought that was one of the primary concerns of Backbone
[22:50] megalomix: > damiano@damiano-P5K-VM:/usr/local$ nave clean 0.6.6; nave usemain 0.6.6
[22:50] megalomix: Can't usemain inside a nave subshell. Exit to main shell.
[22:50] romain__ has joined the channel
[22:50] brianc1: joshsmith: it doesn't include it's own templating library
[22:50] megalomix: isaacs, Can't usemain inside a nave subshell. Exit to main shell.
[22:50] insin: Backbone leaves the rendering entirely up to you - you can continue to write it like crap if you like :)
[22:50] isaacs: megalomix: yeah, type `exit`

[22:53] megalomix: hmmm
[22:53] megalomix: i don't understand the problem
[22:53] devaholic: alcuadrado, if its an npm module, gitignore it
[22:53] devaholic: alcuadrado, if its an application, commit it
[22:53] megalomix: isaacs, i have to use nave use 0.6.6 again ?
[22:53] brianc1: alcuadrado: if it's production deployed, you _might_ want to add node_modules/ to the git repo. that's up to you (I personally do not)
[22:53] bingomanatee: boy I wish my ruby-centric company would let me use Node for streaming output - the task I am set on REALLY screams "Use node for me!"
[22:53] prettyrobots has joined the channel
[22:53] nrstott has joined the channel
[22:53] devaholic: commit it
[22:53] isaacs: megalomix: if you did usemain, then it's installed in your main path.
[22:53] isaacs: megalomix: in /usr/local/bin/node
[22:53] insin: branch and do both :)
[22:53] alcuadrado: it's an app I'm development at the moment, but would then be deployed in a server
[22:53] brianc1: bingomanatee: if you're stuck with ruby, what about event_machine?
[22:54] devaholic: alcuadrado, commit :P
[22:54] megalomix: there is not
[22:54] isaacs: megalomix: please gist the entire output of `nave usemain 0.6.6`
[22:54] isaacs: megalomix: and this:  /usr/local/bin/node -v
[22:54] alcuadrado: but I would be commiting a link to a folder :s which can be different in the production server :s
[22:54] jbpros_ has joined the channel
[22:54] devaholic: fix that
[22:54] alcuadrado: shouldn't I document which modules one should link with npm?
[22:55] shapeshed_: use branches
[22:55] megalomix: isaacs, https://gist.github.com/1483349
[22:55] CrypticSwarm has joined the channel
[22:55] brianc1: alcuadrado: I suggest first ignoring the folder. once you get a solid production deployment set up and you're dependencies need to be locked in place, you might want to add the node_modules/ folder, but don't add it full of symlinks. actually install the dependencies into the folder
[22:55] devaholic: alcuadrado, yes, however, you dont know that module owners will be strict with their versioning, and if they make a minor update which includes changes of another module's major update and breaks your code, its really a PITA to fix
[22:56] devaholic: if its a npm module dont commit, if its an app do so
[22:56] alcuadrado: so I should install de modules locally?
[22:56] devaholic: http://www.mikealrogers.com/posts/nodemodules-in-git.html
[22:56] devaholic: and fix the symlinking stuff before you do
[22:57] isaacs: megalomix: nave usemain has a bug.
[22:57] devaholic: like brianc1 said
[22:57] albertosh has joined the channel
[22:57] isaacs: megalomix: just get the code, install it with ./configure && make && sudo make install if you want it in all envs.
[22:57] isaacs: megalomix: nave is for subshells.
[22:57] isaacs: usemain is an awful hack
[22:57] alcuadrado: ok, thanks for your advice guys :D
[22:58] megalomix: ok
[22:58] megalomix: btw installing node directly
[22:58] megalomix: i will get npm

[23:09] guybrush: isaacs: is there any chance that node&npm will work with package.js anytime in the future? xD
[23:10] isaacs: guybrush: we work with package.json.  (ie, close to zero)

[23:11] brianc1: joshsmith: if you've not yet formed an opinion, i recommend hating it. 
[23:11] brianc1: joshsmith: for client side templating I use mustache.js
[23:11] funkya has joined the channel
[23:11] shapeshed_: see :-) love / hate
[23:11] brianc1: joshsmith: I use mustache.js on the server with node as well actually
[23:11] joshsmith: brianc1: why the hate? and what do you use server-side?
[23:12] joshsmith: ACTION scratches q #2
[23:12] seanh510: joshsmith: fwiw, there are people who enjoy using it
[23:12] brianc1: joshsmith: because writing code and _translating it_ to another language is fucking ridiculous
[23:13] seanh510: so I'd form your own opinion as opposed to taking the advice of "just hate it"
[23:13] guybrush: isaacs: just some ideas in my head going wild, like dynamically scripts-fields or something
[23:13] seanh510: and people have been writing code in one language and "translating" it to another language for years
[23:13] brianc1: joshsmith: the amount of additional mental overhead introduced (you have to understand both what you're writing and how it will translate) and introducing a compile step into otherwise uncompiled code...it makes me sad in my pants
[23:13] jaitaiwan has joined the channel
[23:13] seanh510: brianc1: you must hate Lisp macros then
[23:14] shapeshed_: if you don't know the crap parts of JavaScript CoffeeScript abstracts many of them away
[23:14] isaacs: seanh510: lisp macros are not code generation, though
[23:14] brianc1: seanh510: you're comparing apples to oranges. 
[23:14] joshsmith: in my gut I feel kind of the same way
[23:14] isaacs: seanh510: they're wildly different.
[23:14] ChrisPartridge: mmalecki: ping
[23:14] brianc1: seanh510: getting into a coffee-script debate wasn't my intention. i'll shut up about it
[23:14] seanh510: sorry i dont need to argue about it either
[23:14] isaacs: seanh510: the closest thing to lisp macros that we have in js is substack's burrito stuff
[23:14] joshsmith: I think I got to avoid many of the bad parts simply because I started developing so recently, and learned from pretty decent material
[23:14] Sorella: brianc1, hm, so you mean stuff like Lisp, C, etc?
[23:14] devaholic: compiling to a scripting language?
[23:15] seanh510: but i mean, isn't it ironic to dislike coffee to java script when javascript gets interpreted to bytecode?
[23:15] devaholic: compiling to a scripting language?
[23:15] seanh510: c turns to assembly, etc?
[23:15] devaholic: lol sorry
[23:15] shapeshed_: If you've already gone through learning JS in depth it can seem pointless
[23:16] devaholic: i do not prefer cs
[23:16] Sorella: The only problem with CoffeeScript, right now (besides the parser quirks), is that you don't have any real debugging tool that works on CoffeeScript land, and that renders it quite unusable for some projects/devs.
[23:16] shapeshed_: plus hipster fad factor
[23:16] joshsmith: I was turned off by it simply because I had seen it in some dude's project
[23:16] seanh510: shapeshed_: i hated it in theory because of the "hipster fad factor" until I started writing in it realized it felt nicer
[23:17] joshsmith: and was pissed because I couldn't understand a thing it was saying
[23:17] Sorella: Though languages that provide a better interface to achieve a certain goal, while still maintaining a layer of compatibility with the target language, are certainly delicious. Gotta love 'em DSLs.
[23:17] seanh510: shapeshed_: and it made me more productive
[23:17] tingham_ has joined the channel
[23:17] joshsmith: seanh510: +1 for some productivity increases
[23:18] seanh510: i'm writing serverside though so, perhaps people working in the browser more have wildly different opinions
[23:18] shapeshed_: seanh510: I had a similar experience with scss when it came out
[23:18] seanh510: which i'd respect
[23:18] brianc1: My biggest gripe really is it just introduces another layer. something else to learn before I can get shit done. and it introduces that for _everyone_.  So I can learn it, cool. use it in my own stuff. but I write a module in it. then anyone who wants to contribute has to learn all the stuff needed to contribute to a javascript node.js module and THEN learn coffee-script.  
[23:18] seanh510: brianc1: web coding is so many layers upon layers by now, what's the diff?
[23:18] seanh510: active record over sql over btrees :P
[23:19] seanh510: brianc1: that same argument could be made about any more advanced feature, be it a language, or paradigm, etc
[23:19] joshsmith: that's also my problem brianc1. I would hate to have to make my entire team learn something else
[23:19] Vespakoen has joined the channel
[23:20] seanh510: brianc1: for instance, if you decide to write templated c++ code, all people who want to fork and contribute to your project need to understand templates
[23:20] brianc1: seanh510: and it should be made. introducing layers, complexity, more "noise" should always be weighed against it's benefit 
[23:20] Sorella: brianc1, usually, maintaining an overtly large code base is a much larger issue than having several parts written in one specific language to handle the job.
[23:20] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[23:21] seanh510: brianc1: to each their own, but not embracing something because it's "one more thing to learn" seems like it would keep you in the past/dark more than anything
[23:21] Sorella: not saying CS fits the role of "specific language", but it has its use-cases. For example, writing DSLs in CoffeeScript is much nicer than in JS, so you could use CS for build scripts, for example.
[23:22] joshsmith: btw, I'm also curious as to why I should use something like Backbone over just Require.js for modularizing code
[23:22] joshsmith: is it because something that's doing UI changes shouldn't also be talking to the server in-line?
[23:22] mmalecki: ChrisPartridge: yo
[23:22] Vespakoen: Hi noders! I have a little question, i am building my own framework on top of express (just as a get to know / fun thingy) now i am wondering, i have var myframework = require('./myframework'); when i would have a situation where a "controller" wants to call another "controller" function, can i make a new instance of "myframework" my doing something like myframework2 = require('./myframework'), or should i have the index.js in myframew
[23:22] Vespakoen: ork return a function and then make multiple objects of that ?
[23:22] joshsmith: in which case, why not just abstract out server-specific functions? (or is that exactly the point of Backbone?)
[23:22] seanh510: joshsmith: because look at the number of big name logos in the Backbone.js users list :P

[23:23] josh-k has joined the channel
[23:23] Sorella: One of the things I like the most about Alan Kay's new project is that the team is creating several specific languages to handle each part of the system. So they plan on making an entire usable SO in under 20k lines of code. If you weight the cost of maintaining a 20k code base to the cost of maintaining a 1mil code base...

[23:25] brianc1: joshsmith: think of backbone as kind of guide-rails to help you avoid writing a giant spaghetti code monster in the browser.  it's one way of doing what you said.  it's not the only way, but it's a pretty good way and it helps a lot of people stay within the "clean code lines" more often. 
[23:27] joshsmith: I have a copy of the O'Reilly JS Web Apps book; I'm not sure if I should read that or just take what I know with Express/Node, learn Mocha and Backbone from the docs/source, and just dive in that way

[23:35] hoodow has joined the channel

[23:35] Vespakoen: nrstott, what if i want to use prototype for say, loadModel, will i do something like exports.myframework.prototype.loadModel = function() { ? } ?
[23:35] isaacs: secoif: that can happen if you've installed it once upon a time with some other copy of npm, or from a different global prefix
[23:35] isaacs: secoif: you an either remove the file, or install with --force to clobber what's in the way
[23:35] bartt has joined the channel
[23:36] nrstott: Vespakoen, you should do it like this: function MyFramework() { ... }  MyFramework.prototype.......; module.exports = MyFramework
