[00:45] kesor: can i run something like "node app.js" but with app.coffee instead, without compiling it and so that server reloads each time I change app.coffee ?
[00:45] kvda: How do you use partials with Underscore/Hogan with Node? Can't seem to figure it out
[00:45] tomasm-: hi, is there any way with socket.io long-polling (not web sockets) to utilize a single connection for both server pushing and client pulling? I noticed once I switched from websockets to long polling that any polling on my clients ended up being a separate connection each and every call.... I want to avoid excessive sockets opening/closing every 5 seconds as that slows the browser down significantly
[00:46] kvda: kesor, I think you'll need an auto-reloading package
[00:46] kesor: kvda: oh, think I just figured it out. I'll run "coffee -w app.coffee" and "node app.js" at the same time ...
[00:47] tomasm-: or a way to have multiple commands use the same network request? it seems to open a new request every time I call it, even if it's every 5 seconds
[00:47] sammmy: How can I debug bouncy to figure out what's going wrong?

[00:50] k1ttty has joined the channel
[00:51] ajpiano has joined the channel
[00:53] tomasm-: is the very nature of 'long-polling' that one task be handled per request and a new socket be opened afterwards, rather than keeping it open and somehow streaming data as long as possible?
[00:53] ziro` has joined the channel
[00:53] tomasm-: and is there a way to keep the socket open for multiple requests?
[00:54] kesor: no, you seem to be missing the point a bit.
[00:55] kesor: there are several methods to implement long-polling techniques, one of them is closing the connection after "some" data was sent. but other methods like websockets for example are all about keeping an open tcp connection.
[00:55] tomasm-: yes, well websockets arent an option given that I cant count on browser support... so I have XHR and JSONP to count on
[00:55] andrehjr_ has joined the channel
[00:56] kesor: something interesting I hear about jsonp a while ago, is that because jsonp callbacks are variable, its much harder to cache … thought it an interesting point.
[00:56] tomasm-: what is the 'htmlfile' transport option for socket.io? I see the list of transports but no explanation
[00:56] tomasm-: ie the difference between XHR and JSONP
[00:57] lsdafjklsd has joined the channel
[00:57] thinkt4nk has joined the channel
[00:57] chjj has joined the channel
[00:57] kesor: jsonp is mostly needed for cross-domain access anyway, with same-domain it can be safely avoided altogether.

[00:58] tomasm-: I also see something about xhr-multipart
[01:00] kvda: What's the most powerful tempting engine for Node?
[01:00] kesor: depends on what you mean by power
[01:01] zomg: I'd guess EJS because you can just embed any JS code in your templates :P
[01:01] benvie: and tempting
[01:01] benvie: some things are less sexy than others
[01:01] kvda: zomg that about sounds what i'm looking for
[01:01] deoxxa: allow me to whore out https://github.com/deoxxa/node-ginger
[01:01] kesor: looks like jade is quite popular, its a kind of haml. and mustache/hogan are more minimalistic.
[01:01] deoxxa: (my templating language thingy)
[01:01] kvda: kesor, actually all i really want at this point is simple if/else and include funcs
[01:02] tomasm-: is there a way to minimize browser slowdown from excessive socket opening/closing (while keeping things pretty active, ie 5 second intervals)  without using websockets? Or do I need to move to a server-push model instead of a client-pull model?
[01:02] kesor: kvda: jade does that.
[01:02] kvda: I don't like the Jade syntax
[01:02] kvda: it seems so unnecessary
[01:02] chjj has joined the channel
[01:02] kesor: i like it. it enforces clean code.
[01:03] deoxxa: it also enforces HTML
[01:03] superlou has joined the channel
[01:03] deoxxa: ._.
[01:03] kvda: yeah and HTML is already HTML, don't see the need to abstract it
[01:03] zomg: Mustache is nice but sometimes it makes you jump through extra hoops
[01:03] zomg: When you just want to do something simple but it won't let you
[01:04] kvda: with hogan.js, the docs are not there, and partials are weird, you have to pass it on the view func
[01:04] kvda: ie you cant just have partials call in the template
[01:04] kvda: yeah exactly zomg
[01:04] warz: yea, i bailed on mustache templates.
[01:04] kvda: might have to go with python/jinja2 on this build
[01:04] tomasm-: I have to worry about long polling performance, without websockets as an option, and am trying to see if there's a way to do so using pure client pulling every 5 seconds... or if it's better/easier to design a push+pull architecture of the system to keep performance better (though this adds tremendous complexity to the system)
[01:04] deoxxa: https://github.com/deoxxa/node-ginger << based on jinja2 syntax
[01:05] warz: i've been using swig, which is a jinja clone basically.
[01:05] deoxxa: (note the name)
[01:05] warz: https://github.com/paularmstrong/swig
[01:05] kesor: i always hated jinja2. it allows too much power where it should be really forbidden.
[01:05] kvda: I haven't looked up Ginger and Swig yet, thanks guys
[01:05] r04r has joined the channel
[01:05] kvda: power is good
[01:05] kesor: not where it should be avoided.
[01:06] kesor: too much power makes you write code that you cant maintain two weeks after you wrote it.
[01:06] kvda: I haven't had that experience, and jinja2 walks that tight rope quite nicely
[01:07] lakkris has joined the channel
[01:07] kesor: had my share of projects that had loops in django models.py, then again on the same things loops in views.py, and then again several loops in the jinja2 templates ...
[01:07] kvda: Ah
[01:07] chjj has joined the channel
[01:07] kvda: I see what you mean
[01:07] kesor: and people were wondering why the system was so slow … when the main page did 10k sql hits on the db.
[01:08] deoxxa: that's a bit silly
[01:08] zomg: Should've used MongoDB!
[01:08] warz: doesnt sound like a jinja problem. :p
[01:08] kvda: Haha!
[01:08] zomg: Because MongoDB is web scale, 10k hits, pffft
[01:08] kesor: i worked on trying to fix it for half a year, and then I just quit.
[01:08] sammmy: How could I debug bouncy?
[01:08] sammmy: I'm using the command-line tool from bouncy, not the app.
[01:09] kesor: yeah, i'm working on a mongodb system right now … don't get me started on the atrocities that are still used in this system.
[01:09] kvda: Swig looks hotness
[01:10] r04r has joined the channel
[01:11] deoxxa: the parser is a bit :x
[01:11] warz: yea, the parser code is a little fugly. heh.
[01:12] kvda: what are the maturity levels of Swig vs Ginger?
[01:12] kvda: hardest thing with node is choosing the packages
[01:12] warz: but, having tried to fit mustache templates into my work flow for a few months, i finally just said fuck it and picked a different engine
[01:12] chjj has joined the channel
[01:13] zomg: I'm using Mustache in some PHP stuff
[01:13] zomg: We can use same template on both PHP and JS ends
[01:13] zomg: That's the only reason really :P
[01:13] deoxxa: kvda: i'm biassed, obviously, and i've only seen swig for the first time today, but i'm using ginger in production at work and it seems pretty stable. i started it about 4 months ago.
[01:13] warz: what does the mean, though? in nodejs land, pretty much all the popular choices can run on both browser and server.
[01:14] igl1 has joined the channel
[01:14] warz: i guess mustache is a pretty widely portable format though, or whatever.

[05:40] joaojeronimo: sammmy: why would you use it for production ?
[05:40] Zebra12: shouldn't really be useful in production
[05:40] Zebra12: probably other problems if it is
[05:40] sammmy: joaojeronimo: if there's an error it doesn't crash the entire site.
[05:41] joaojeronimo: sammmy: Take a look at the up module
[05:42] sammmy: joaojeronimo: cannot find it in npm
[05:42] joaojeronimo: sammmy: well if there's an error you'll have to step in and correct your code so it can restart again... I think that in production your code should be bullet proof
[05:42] sammmy: joaojeronimo: but how do you ever know if your code is full proof?
[05:43] joaojeronimo: sammmy: https://github.com/LearnBoost/up

[05:45] level09 has joined the channel
[05:45] sammmy: I suppose that throws aren't such a good idea then..because everytime you throw it bubbles up to the console?
[05:45] joaojeronimo: sammmy: take a look at this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash-only_software it's more or less the following: your software should handle a lot of situations, but at a user generated fault it simply restarts
[05:46] zackattack has joined the channel
[05:47] alex_burke has left the channel
[05:47] cainus: sammmy: throws are a great idea.  you have to catch them though.
[05:47] joaojeronimo: catch them and log them
[05:48] cainus: or just recover from them if possible
[05:48] sammmy: cainus: How do you catch them though if you have these insanely nested callbacks, hopping around in your code?
[05:48] kPb_in has joined the channel
[05:48] sammmy: joaojeronimo: That's what I need to set up, a logger. I'm using Express.
[05:48] insanoid has joined the channel
[05:49] cainus: well with callbacks it's different... usually your callbacks will take an error as the first param... obviously you need to check if that's non-null
[05:49] kvda has joined the channel
[05:49] cainus: all the time :\
[05:49] joaojeronimo: sammmy: I use loggly with everything, some files for rare things
[05:49] sammmy: is up like nodemon?
[05:49] kPb_in_ has joined the channel
[05:50] joaojeronimo: sammy: up is very different from nodemon. It's designed to keep your application up, nodemon is for development
[05:51] sammmy: joaojeronimo: how is up different from nodemon?
[05:51] joaojeronimo: sammmy: nodemon is to keep you from having to restart your application everytime you edit something, up created a cluster of servers from your application, if one of these servers goes down you still have the others up, and the one that went down is restarted. Also, when you edit the file, it will make a graceful restart
[05:52] sammmy: so the only thing up and nodemon have in common is that up restarts on working directory changes?
[05:52] joaojeronimo: a graceful restart means not stopping the "old code", start running your "new code", then when all the clients that you were serving with the "old code" go away, the "old code" goes away too and you have your server running 100% the "new code"
[05:53] joaojeronimo: sammmy: up ->gracefully<- restarts... It does not leave anyone hanging, it's perfect for production
[05:53] sammmy: joaojeronimo: I see. So what constitutes a client being served, or a client going away?
[05:53] sammmy: and HTTP connection?
[05:53] sammmy: an*
[05:53] briancra_ has joined the channel
[05:53] joaojeronimo: sammmy: nodemon makes your app actually restart, meaning all the requests you were serving is stopped and your clients are left hanging
[05:54] joaojeronimo: sammmy: yes
[05:54] sammmy: So does it proxy all client http requests to separate instances of my app?
[05:54] joaojeronimo: I'm sorry I meant that a client being served is in fact someone with a client app such as a browser making an HTTP request to your website based on express
[05:55] joaojeronimo: sammmy: yes it does
[05:56] sammmy: But aren't HTTP requests short lived, does this mean that these "graceful" restarts can happen fairly quickly (depending on how much traffic my site gets)?

[05:57] sammmy: Is there any information lost by using a proxy?
[05:58] westg: information lost?
[05:58] joaojeronimo: sammmy: I'm not 100% sure but from what I read I think that these graceful restarts happen when your "old code" finished serving the requests it was serving when you put in your "old code"
[05:58] sammmy: westg: Yes, like request information.
[05:58] kirbysayshi has joined the channel
[05:58] westg: up helps node "up"
[05:58] westg: that's the point
[05:58] sammmy: westg: sounds good to me. :)
[05:58] joaojeronimo: sammy: in the up github page it says "Works at the HTTP request level. It never drops requests or destroys Keep-Alive sockets while reloading."
[05:59] westg: a proxy doesn't have anything to do with creating worker processes to transparently hand over control when the new processess are ready
[05:59] kejun has joined the channel
[05:59] niloy has joined the channel
[05:59] sammmy: So, I can basically just use up with the & flag and be done with it?
[05:59] westg: basically yes
[06:00] westg: for more advanced stuff, no
[06:00] sammmy: What about socket connections?
[06:00] joaojeronimo: westg: actually I think that you have a proxy on top of those workers
[06:00] take_cheeze has joined the channel
[06:00] westg: and I would not use &
[06:00] westg: nohup is BAD
[06:00] westg: use forever if you wan to do that
[06:00] westg: want*
[06:00] sammmy: forever?
[06:00] sammmy: & is called nohup?
[06:01] westg: forever is a "&" replacement and can also be used to watch file changes
[06:01] westg: forever + up is the best production combo imo
[06:01] westg: or you can just have up running in a screen session
[06:01] westg: that's what I'm doing ^
[06:02] westg: idk how any linux user works over ssh without screen
[06:02] westg: or even locally on the terminal
[06:02] sammmy: what's a screen session?
[06:02] westg: it's like having windows open on Windows
[06:03] westg: you can "minimize" and "maximize" them at will
[06:03] saimukesh has joined the channel
[06:03] westg: so it allows you to have a bunch of virtual terminal sessions essentially
[06:03] westg: and you can easily switch between them with a few key commands
[06:03] westg: really cool stuff
[06:04] sammmy: is it all cmd line based?
[06:04] westg: it's for the terminal
[06:04] westg: bash
[06:04] westg: I'm talking about unix
[06:05] Morkel has joined the channel
[06:05] sammmy: command-line based I mean (not to be confused with cmd.exe, sorry for that little confuzzle)
[06:05] westg: yea
[06:05] westg: no gui
[06:05] sammmy: I see.
[06:05] westg: that's why it's awesome
[06:05] westg: because it's seamless
[06:06] westg: no switching to a "gui-like" interface
[06:06] sammmy: However, I don't _need_ this at the moment. Maybe I can watch a demo of it on youtube or something, but for now I'm keeping it simple.
[06:07] sammmy: So why is nohup bad?
[06:07] sammmy: Is it okay to use nohup with bouncy?
[06:08] westg: for example: I have two screen sessions running right now. one for my two database programs: redis on "window" 1, mongod on "window" 2. then in another session I have my node app running with up in window 1, htop running in window 2, and a blank terminal on window 3
[06:08] westg: isk what bouncy is
[06:08] westg: idk*
[06:08] westg: nohup isn't that reliable I think
[06:09] westg: and I think the process to kill a nohup process isn't that clean
[06:09] westg: forever does a better job for the specific use with node
[06:10] owen1: I have User.updatePrices(user) that calls Scrapper.run for each product of user.  my goal is to save the user in the db with the results of the scraping. I need some sort of a hash that is shared between all those callbacks, and i need to know when the last callback was called. how do i achieve that?
[06:13] sammmy: westg: kill <pid> is pretty simple/clean?
[06:13] sammmy: bouncy is a proxying module for node js
[06:14] sammmy: Are screens persistent; to they continue to run even after you exist out of your ssh session?
[06:15] vikstrous has joined the channel
[06:16] westg: screens are persistant
[06:16] westg: yes
[06:16] westg: you can try nohup with up
[06:16] westg: it might actually not make a difference
[06:16] westg: but I used to use forever before since it watched files as well
[06:19] trivol has joined the channel
[06:19] sammmy: screen seems pretty cool, and not too complicated to use (I'm guesssing)
[06:19] sammmy: I like how they terminal windows in screen are persistent. So I can log into my VPS at any time, fireup screen, and view any error logs and what not.
[06:21] sammmy: Though, how do you continue a screen session?

[06:54] MerlinDMC: owen1, buffering before doing time consuming io ... makes sense

[06:54] owen1: MerlinDMC: i appologize. i didn't understand the global.xx, or the singletone or the buffring...
[06:55] owen1: MerlinDMC: so u'r saying i can store the scraping as jobs in some sort of queuing solution.

[16:49] M28: but once it hits a certain size, doing everything in C++ is faster

[16:50] shen-ninja has joined the channel
[16:50] saml: creationix, really?
[16:50] enjalot has joined the channel
[16:51] saml: so C++ is slower than javascript?
[16:51] pandeiro has joined the channel
[16:51] saml: for v8
[16:51] Venom_X: M28: you can use messagepack. Have you looked into that?
[16:51] M28: I need it to be json
[16:51] wavded: nm figured out my issue, wasn't including the C++ object in my build, dooh!
[16:51] M28: lots of dependencies on json already
[16:52] whaley has joined the channel
[16:52] M28: and the library I'm using only supports json
[16:52] EhevuTov has joined the channel
[16:52] jscheel has joined the channel
[16:52] creationix: no, C++ isn't slower than javascript
[16:52] creationix: but calling into C++ from JS is slower than calling into JS from JS
[16:53] creationix: it has to put up barriers in the vm, convert types and all sorts of other stuff
[16:53] baudehlo: or more accurately, converting objects.
[16:53] akshayms_ has joined the channel
[16:53] M28: the overhead is only big for small functions, like < 10 statements
[16:53] dodo has joined the channel
[16:53] M28: json serialization is a little bigger than that
[16:53] creationix: perhaps
[16:53] creationix: I just know it's quite expensive
[16:54] creationix: besides the overhead, the jit can't optimize C functions
[16:54] baudehlo: I'm sure the google guys knew what they were doing when they decided to keep it in JS.
[16:54] creationix: they are black boxes
[16:54] creationix: it has to assume anything can happen in there
[16:54] creationix: so any code calling native C functions can't use many kinds of optimizations
[16:54] M28: But JIT wouldn't be that good anyway for serialization, it's much better for mathematical operations, etc
[16:54] M28: since the new instructions codes only deal with that
[16:54] benvie: is there a more direct way to accomplush this
[16:55] benvie: new Buffer(new Int8Array(10).buffer, 0, 10)
[16:55] benvie: if I try with an ArrayBuffer directly it fails
[16:55] benvie: like crashes node
[16:55] chjj: i thought only the json stringifier was written in js ... ?
[16:55] chjj: if i remember right, the parser is actually c++
[16:55] M28: I remember the stringifier is in javascript, let me see the parser
[16:55] lambda_x: when I run npm update, connect downgrades from 2.0.2 to 1.8.6, how can I find out the reason?
[16:56] sadjow has joined the channel
[16:56] baudehlo: benvie: what are you trying to achieve there?
[16:56] M28: Here it is: http://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/json.js
[16:56] benvie: trying to get a node Buffer that's using any ArrayBuffer for a parent
[16:56] saml: can you jit data marshalling?
[16:57] benvie: it works
[16:57] M28: seems like only the serializer is in javascript
[16:57] M28: the parser is in C++
[16:57] saml: so that it'll be fast next time you marshall js data to c++ and vice versa
[16:57] slajax has joined the channel
[16:57] M28: but I mostly use the serializer
[16:57] baudehlo: benvie: oh guess it's not something that is documented.

[16:58] benvie: so I can make my struct thing work in browsers and node without a bunch of extra code
[16:58] chjj: it was probably just more practical to write the stringifier in js, its really easy to write a stringifier
[16:58] ag4ve: (or if there are holes in that model)

[18:00] drostie has joined the channel

[18:19] baudehlo: sure. But it'll likely barely blip onto the radar if you profile.
[18:20] baudehlo: and if it does, it's easy to move it to nginx

[19:43] isaacs: erichocean: but really, you should not be doing manual things with paths and \

[21:19] `3rdEden: isaacs but that's already case as symlinks don't work properly on windows
[21:19] monokrome: Windows has symbolic links
[21:20] isaacs: arturadib: probably.  install -g isn't really for require() anyhow.  nvm may be doing magic.

[21:20] isaacs: monokrome: you don't get to say it "has symbolic links" unless it also has readlink and all the other symlink-related semantics, available to non-admin users, in all versions of windows that node supports.  until then, we cannot rely on them.
[21:21] isaacs: monokrome: or rather, even though it has mklink /L or whatever, that doesn't help npm.
[21:21] monokrome: isaacs: Windows has them. I never said Windows ME did :)
[21:21] isaacs: arturadib: yeah, strictly for that.
[21:21] isaacs: arturadib: npm faq
[21:21] isaacs: `3rdEden: it's not that they "don't work properly".  it's that they cause unpredictable behavior when tar tries to unpack packages containing them.
[21:23] isaacs: `3rdEden: and, i can easily create a situation where things work portably, by simply not unpacking symlinks.
[21:24] arturadib: isaacs: so just to double-check, the recommended practice for a module that has both executables and libraries is to do both a global and a local install?
[21:25] isaacs: arturadib: or npm link (which is not supported on windows, for reasons very recently discussed ;)
