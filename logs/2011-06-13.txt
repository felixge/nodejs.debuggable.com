[00:03] SubStack: here's what tests look like: https://github.com/substack/testling/blob/master/test/a.js https://github.com/substack/testling/blob/master/test/b.js
[00:04] SubStack: they run in your browser
[00:04] Chani: my assignment has to have "concurrency"
[00:04] tmpvar: JoseCabo, what happens when you run test/sanity.js?
[00:04] JoseCabo: where do you what i paste it?
[00:04] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: noice
[00:04] SubStack: Chani: concurrency is not the same as multithread
[00:05] JoseCabo: tmm1, where do you want i paste it?
[00:05] JoseCabo: tmpvar, where do you want i paste it?
[00:05] JoseCabo: (fuck xD)
[00:05] Chani: SubStack: yes... but I'm not sure what exactly is going on inside fs when I get io callbacks...
[00:05] SubStack: Chani: also node has lots of threads behind the scenes

[00:05] rchavik has joined the channel
[00:05] Chani: SubStack: oh, okies
[00:06] Chani: I'm hping that node will pass whatever tests the TA runs to verify concurrency...
[00:06] level09: SubStack: what in the world is that ?
[00:06] SubStack: level09: in-browser test suite
[00:07] level09: looks cool although I dont get it :D
[00:07] SubStack: and it will have buttons for running your tests in different browsers using browserling
[00:07] Chani: hmmm, testling isn't loading for me
[00:07] SubStack: level09: unit tests in your browser
[00:07] level09: aha
[00:07] SubStack: Chani: it's super slow is all :p
[00:07] Chani: ok :)
[00:07] SubStack: since the browserify bundle isn't minified and I'm on crappy cheap comcast
[00:07] level09: what are the percentages on the right ?
[00:08] SubStack: percent complete of the tests

[00:18] SubStack: bakert: yes and it's horrible
[00:18] tmpvar: JoseCabo, ok.. so it works for the most part.  I'm seeing undefineds as well.. but it doesn't use a ton of memory
[00:19] bakert: SubStack: horrible as in jade's support is bad or horrible as in doing something else makes more sense?
[00:19] brownies has joined the channel
[00:19] SubStack: actually partials are built into express not jade
[00:19] SubStack: I think that is the horrible part
[00:19] bakert: yeah, i found the express partials
[00:19] JoseCabo: tmpvar, examples doesn't use a ton of memory neither hehe
[00:19] bakert: but that's not where i want to tell the program to use a parital :)
[00:19] tmpvar: JoseCabo, can you try changing setInterval to setTimeout in lesson3.js ?
[00:19] tmpvar: JoseCabo, so it works now?
[00:19] JoseCabo: Yes, i can, wait a moment.
[00:20] paul_k has joined the channel
[00:20] bakert: i am trying !=partial which google says might work and might not

[00:20] JoseCabo: tmpvar, the actual examples are with setTimeout function...
[00:20] KingJamool has joined the channel
[00:21] JoseCabo: anyway with setTimeout or setInterval doesn't works

[00:21] JoseCabo: Violaci�n de segmento
[00:21] JoseCabo: this i mena
[00:21] JoseCabo: segment fault*
[00:21] JoseCabo: after execute the "second function".
[00:22] tmpvar: odd
[00:22] JoseCabo: hehe
[00:22] tmpvar: you have the latest mesa-gl1-dev package installed?
[00:22] JoseCabo: the default packages in my distro
[00:22] tmpvar: ok, how about video drivers?
[00:23] JoseCabo: defualt nvidia drivers with compiz activated
[00:23] JoseCabo: mesa-gl1-dev package isn't in my repos, the name is correctly?
[00:23] tmpvar: hrm

[00:43] _beau: as in 2 seperate redis clients assigned to each var/object
[00:43] edude03 has joined the channel
[00:43] _beau: is there a reason to use more than one redis client vs. just 1 to rule them all?
[00:44] Bradleymeck has joined the channel
[00:44] _beau: kinda seemed like a waste, just for variable name simplification, but i thought there might be something else i was missing
[00:45] _beau: for example: https://gist.github.com/935463
[00:45] _beau: 1 for storage, 1 for publish, 1 for subscribing
[00:45] _beau: i dont see the benefits

[00:49] aaronblohowiak: remembering which redis response goes with which request
[00:49] _beau: hmm
[00:50] aaronblohowiak: _beau: also, clients that are subscribed to events cant do anything else =)
[00:50] _beau: ah, theres a good use case
[00:50] _beau: i'm only using it for pub/sub
[00:50] aaronblohowiak: _beau: (except subscribe to more)
[00:50] _beau: not storage
[00:50] aaronblohowiak: you'd still need 2
[00:50] aaronblohowiak: one for pub one for sub
[00:50] _beau: i've always just used 1
[00:51] kruckenb has joined the channel
[00:51] aaronblohowiak: _beau: well your redis client library may automatically create another connection

[00:52] _beau: im familiar with the methods
[00:52] _beau: just never saw 2 clients used

[00:55] _beau: though i love using your libs
[00:55] _beau: and btw: thanks for the nodjitsu invite
[00:55] Marak: _beau: this is the best one i've ever done, by leaps and bounds
[00:55] Marak: would not be possible without like 5 other developers
[00:55] _beau: :D
[00:55] Marak: dnode, forever eventemitter2
[00:55] Marak: socket.io
[00:55] Marak: all of these
[00:55] _beau: my favorites
[00:56] _beau: :D
[00:56] _beau: i just dont know if i have a ready use-case for it yet
[00:56] _beau: im still most interested in the JSONloops
[00:56] aaronblohowiak: Marak: how are you fanning out socket.io ?
[00:56] Marak: aaronblohowiak: i have to release https://github.com/marak/hook.io-webserver
[00:57] Marak: then you require Hook.js file on browser
[00:57] Marak: and its the same command
[00:57] Marak: so linking up multiple socket.io servers is trivial
[00:57] Marak: bitches
[00:57] Marak: :-
[00:57] Marak: :-)
[00:57] Marak: linking up multiple anythings is easy
[00:57] Marak: this shit is the new rails
[00:57] Marak: bet on it
[00:57] Marak: :-D
[00:57] _beau: lol
[00:57] JoseCabo: tmpvar, i have more odd news xD. I tested with "my server" PC. it have and ATI... and a +- nice version, clean version?, of Ubuntu. it have an ATI... it works! With free and privative drivers :S But, why in my computer not? why in my bf two computers it doesn't work?? :(
[00:58] Marak: its the iopocalypse
[00:58] Marak: you are witnessing it happen!
[00:58] aaronblohowiak: Marak: i dont understand.. socket.io uses in-memory storage to keep track of which client is subscribed to which channel and the outbound messages for clients
[00:58] DTrejo: new kind of ios device Marak ?
[00:58] xerox: hahaha
[00:58] Marak: aaronblohowiak: why not rebroadcast the messages somewhere else?
[00:58] Marak: aaronblohowiak: then bounce them back
[00:59] Marak: hook.io doesnt rebroadcast duplicate messages
[00:59] Marak: id setup server hook.io-webservers and have them all report to a master server
[00:59] Marak: that master server would be super beefy
[00:59] Marak: and handle message channel diffs
[01:00] Marak: boom
[01:00] Marak: setup *several
[01:00] Marak: sorry
[01:00] sudhirjonathan has joined the channel
[01:00] _beau: does this replace the use of any other current libs out there?
[01:02] Marak: _beau: its meant to wrap 80% of current node libs in hooks
[01:02] Marak: independent ones 
[01:02] Marak: anything that does i/o
[01:03] Marak: i gotta go take a break, gonna go do a docs run after that
[01:03] Marak: havent eatten all day
[01:03] Marak: oops
[01:03] aaronblohowiak: Marak: the problem is that socket.io keeps state between requests.
[01:03] aaronblohowiak: whoops indeed!
[01:03] DTrejo: Marak: YOUR FOOD IS YOUR BRAIN
[01:04] _beau: lol
[01:04] Marak: aaronblohowiak: hook.io will be able to scale and cluster socket.io 100%, its not a priority for me right now, at all
[01:04] Marak: aaronblohowiak: it will get done though, bet on it
[01:04] _beau: im about to implement Cluster
[01:04] aaronblohowiak: okay
[01:04] Marak: ill bet you 100 bitcoins! :-D
[01:04] aaronblohowiak: no, thank you.
[01:04] _beau: is this to be used with or instead of cluster
[01:04] abraxas has joined the channel
[01:04] Marak: _beau: you could use it with if you wanted to
[01:05] Marak: _beau: you can wrap any server with hook.io if you want to broadcast events to the hook.io cloud
[01:05] _beau: recommended?
[01:05] _beau: hmmmm
[01:05] Marak: just user cluster

[03:20] hermanjunge: I was looking for TJ

[03:27] Marak: hermanjunge: its built on shoulder of giants lol
[03:27] Marak: now just spin up multiple hookio-helloworld
[03:27] Marak: they will all talk to each other
[03:27] Marak: then you can startup, hookio-logger and it will start logging
[03:27] Marak: you can even startup the logger first, and it will act as server
[03:28] Marak: most hooks can act as both server and client seamlessly
[03:28] Marak: i might allow the ability to restrict that though, it can get a little minding for certain hooks
[03:29] hermanjunge: I got three helloworld's greeting each other
[03:30] hermanjunge: have you thought on an enqueuer yet?
[03:30] hermanjunge: example, some hook is sending you files
[03:30] hermanjunge: that's the next step
[03:31] hermanjunge: the other is a property on every hook: a hook could be a "receiving hook", a "sending hook" or a "sending-receiving" hook

[03:38] Marak: maybe its built in now, ask tj
[03:38] Marak: or read the docs
[03:38] dwasp: Marak: didn't see anything specific in the docs, seems like it
[03:39] dwasp: 's built in for GETs, but I have app.use(express.bodyParser()) and have tried a post as well
[03:40] dwasp: I must be doing something dumb, because it's a simple use case
[03:40] Marak: dwasp: i think you should read the docs again, express can totally do that
[03:40] dwasp: is there something besides http://expressjs.com/guide.html ?
[03:41] dwasp: Marak: nevermind, thanks. I need to use req.param('param_name') instead of req.params.param_name
[03:42] tc444: Marak: i'm interested in what OS node developers are developing on vs. what they deploy it on.
[03:42] dwasp: which I was confused about, apparently req.params only contains the route params
[03:42] Marak: tc444: we develop on mac os machines and ubuntu machines
[03:42] Marak: tc444: deploy to ubuntu
[03:42] Marak: tc444: www.nodejitsu.com

[03:46] Marak: dwasp: its REALLY important to me that we don't leave a negative experience with anyone, so we need to reach a certain level of quality before i can spam accounts out

[03:49] Marak: tc444: our node.js application server is open-source, so if you want to start hosting on your own hardware or locally you can, https://github.com/nodejitsu/haibu
[03:50] tc444: once i do there will be at least 100 more production sites using node
[03:50] Marak: tc444: we run 1000s of those haibu servers on our cloud
[03:50] Marak: tc444: yeah check out haibu 
[03:50] tc444: already checking it out ;x

[05:50] Chani: if Buffer.length does not reflect the size of the contents, then what does?
[05:50] Chani: I need to know how many bytes of the incoming data I actually ought to save
[05:50] Chani: or else when the next chunk of data comes in and I somehow find a way to append it, I'll get garbage between the two chunks of data.
[05:51] Aria: Track what you put into the buffer.
[05:51] Chani: Aria: the buffer is incoming data from a socket.
[05:51] Chani: I don't control what comes in
[05:52] Chani: I need to reassemble it and parse it
[05:52] Chani: buffer.length is 120, but I know that the data my test script sent was 94 bytes.
[05:53] Chani: this seems like a pretty basic problem...
[05:53] tim_smart: JakeyChan: var file_content = fs.readFileSync('filename', 'utf8')
[05:54] tim_smart: Only do it on app/script initiation phase.
[05:54] Chani: how the crap do I find out the real size of an incoming chunk of data?

[05:55] tim_smart: Chani: ^
[05:56] Chani: wha?
[05:56] Chani: nonono, buffer.length is evil
[05:56] Chani: it returns nonsense
[05:56] tim_smart: data.length sorry
[05:56] Chani: lenght is evil.
[05:56] tim_smart: data.length returns the size of the buffer
[05:56] tim_smart: in bytes
[05:56] Chani: which is not the size of the contents
[05:56] tim_smart: So you want character length?
[05:57] Chani: I get 120, when I know my test client sent only 94 bytes
[05:57] Chani: I want to know exactly how many bytes were actually read from the socket
[05:57] Chani: not the size of the buffer node decided to allocate to hold those bytes

[06:00] Aria: Woot. Minor rev to node-smtp
[06:00] Chani: I should test this with the client that intentionally chops up messages, actually.
[06:00] kohai: @aredridel: Woot! I just made a minor revision to node-smtp. Yay polishing #nodejs projects!
[06:01] Chani: if the message all comes in one blob hten I get the header and can extract the length from that; the problem is if I don't get the whole header in the first data event.

[06:12] Chani: tim_smart: I tested some more, and it's behaving better with the client that sends plain text split up into lots of little packets... the buffer is always equal to the amount that's added to the string, at least
[06:12] Chani: tim_smart: one dd thing I notice is that this other client is sending one more byte than its claimed message length.
[06:12] Chani: so... maybe there's just garbage at hte end of the message sometimes, for some inexplicable reason
[06:13] Chani: but having it at the end is tolerable; so long as it's not in the middle :)

[09:26] mscdex: pdf is about as ridiculous as binary msoffice formats
[09:26] mscdex: :p
[09:26] Marak: mscdex: what do you call a hook that can boh act as a client (input) and server (output) by default 
[09:26] ngs has joined the channel
[09:26] Marak: like hook.io-helloworld
[09:27] mscdex: no idea
[09:27] Marak: dual-sided it is
[09:27] stride: full duplex? :)
[09:27] mscdex: yeah maybe something like that too
[09:27] Marak: stride: it would be quad-duplex
[09:28] Marak: stride: each channel is bi-directional
[09:28] mscdex: :o
[09:28] Marak: you guys know how ill hook.io is right
[09:28] Marak: npm install hook.io-helloworld -g
[09:28] Marak: npm install hook.io-logger -g
[09:28] Marak: then start up: hookio-helloworld, hookio-logger
[09:28] Marak: as many as you want
[09:28] Marak: in whatever order you want
[09:28] Marak: they know what to do
[09:29] Marak: first hook will be server, all subsequent hooks will connect as clients
[09:29] Marak: both helloworld and logger can act as server and client
[09:29] Marak: wrap your mind around that and smoke it
[09:30] stride: yah, I saw what you did there when you first talked about it here, looks nice

[09:51] Marak: pquerna: ive built something amazing here. bringing many ideas from erlang to node. with hook.io you can easily build custom i/o strategies for any type of i/o....
[09:51] Skola: Calvin's back, amazing
[09:51] Calvin: Calvin's a schizo amazing
[09:51] Skola: :D

[09:54] pquerna: i think re-using the EventEmitter interface will basically conqueor the universe
[09:54] Marak: pquerna: obviously not great for most applications if you go full retard like that, but you see the power? you can structure your i/o in a tree, so depending on how many levels down the tree you are, the less important that i/o is to your main business logic
[09:54] Marak: pquerna: i can also take any piece of sync or async code, throw it on a new process with a callback
[09:54] Marak: pquerna: so like memory leak in jsdom? no problem, use https://github.com/tmpvar/hook.io-jsdom

[09:55] Marak: pquerna approves of hook.io?
[09:55] pquerna: weight.
[09:55] Marak: lol
[09:56] Marak: we'll see where it goes, gonna rebuild kohai in it first
[09:56] Marak: as the first "real" app i think
[09:56] Marak: !insult kohai 
[09:56] Calvin: kohai doesn't have a love instructor
[09:56] pquerna: i think the conceptual thing is spot on, that message passing architectures are the key to long term scalability and and currently node doesn't have a standard method of doing this.
[09:56] pquerna: i think ryan also wants something 'like' this in the long run
[09:56] pquerna: he has been... playing with some p2p ideas
[09:57] Marak: pquerna: yeah, if you see my hook.io talk from jsconf 2010, you see im all about IPO
[09:57] Marak: input, process, output
[09:57] Marak: me and ryah see pretty eye to eye on this
[09:57] Marak: ive been wanting to do this for years

[09:59] Marak: pquerna: i got a way better idea

[09:59] Marak: pquerna: distributed persistence

[10:22] level09: yeah
[10:22] Marak: level09: hook.io is for creating a mesh / cloud of i/o hooks
[10:22] Marak: level09: much different scopes

[10:50] level09: viz: it seems to work with cluster, and scales to some extent, but I think a lot of session Ids are lost

[11:57] eirikb: Marak: It's still a cool concept I think... But nevertheless, do you know how I can get proper error messages?
[11:58] eirikb: Maybe browserify might magically correct this, since dnode like to work with it. But I don't feel like using browserify
[11:58] Marak: eirikb: its a stupid concept built poorly. if you want a shared namespace on an object you dont sacrifice durability for it. 
[11:59] Marak: eirikb: i have no idea wtf your problem could be, did you post code?
[11:59] Marak: what error message?
[11:59] Marak: where? what library?
[11:59] Marak: ohh i see
[11:59] eirikb: :)
[11:59] Marak: eirikb: you could wrap in a try catch prob
[12:00] eirikb: I thought that was exactly what dnode did, so I would wrap a warp to prevent dnode from wrapping it?
[12:00] Marak: you should be able to catch the error
[12:00] Marak: id have to see the whole code
[12:00] eirikb: Let me try to create something for you to see

[12:05] sharkbone: @ Marak this is the question just as i asked on stack http://stackoverflow.com/posts/6330115/revisions
[12:05] eirikb: Something like that. It would basically throw out this in browser console: "Uncaught ReferenceError: omg is not defined", which is all well, but not the line number: dnode.js:1505
[12:05] Marak: eirikb: wrap that fail() in a try catch ?

[12:08] sharkbone: @ Marak
[12:08] eirikb: Marak: Wouldn't the browser refer to the catch in that case? So then it would depend on how 'far out' I put my catch?
[12:08] sharkbone: you are right
[12:08] sharkbone: i take another look at it
[12:09] Marak: eirikb: put try catch around fail() call
[12:09] Marak: eirikb: what else you want to know?
[12:09] eirikb: Marak: The exact line number where it fails
[12:09] Marak: eirikb: did you put try catch around call? did it not return line number?
[12:10] eirikb: If fail was a larger function, calling other functions, I would never know where in the stacktrace it failed
[12:10] mendel_: not node related: which icon set (or website) do you guys use? (free/opensource)

[17:09] bitwise_: ok i will take a look. do the req, res objects factor in there?
[17:09] bitwise_: in the object/function the module exports that is
[17:09] CoverSlide: also, you can set module.exports to an object, then require() will return the object itself
[17:10] bnoordhuis: bitwise_: no, if i understand what you mean - req and res are artifacts from the api exported by http.js
[17:10] tbranyen: making exports an object imo was a bad idea

[17:10] bitwise_: thats what im trying to do. i built a test around it and its says object is not a function at Object.CALL_NON_FUNCTION (native)

[18:51] bnoordhuis: Murvin_: the network-related stuff
[18:51] Murvin_: hm  everything?
[18:51] Murvin_: is there any sensitive network information I shouldn't show in the post?

[18:52] Murvin_: whT?
[18:52] Murvin_: I m still here...
[18:52] bnoordhuis: Murvin_: the sysctl is all pretty benign
[18:53] kohai: @deremer: @danshipper Thanks. More of an experiment than anything else. First thing I've made with Node.js + Heroku, so good to cut my teeth on those
[18:53] Murvin_: bnoorduis:  done. in my issues now.

[18:56] mscdex: hah.
[18:56] tbranyen: woot another bot to ignore
[18:56] Murvin_: so, in the beginning, when I load test, the http.request will throw socket hang up error few minutes after the load test is done.   Then i solved it by having the request. abort() when timeout.   But now, it seems to have another problem when leaving the program for long time.  Not sure it is related or separated problem as the http.request
[18:56] mscdex: Calvin: node.js rules!

[18:57] blueadept: anyone know how you can fetch collection stats with mongoose?
[18:58] Murvin_: Bnoordhuis:  I can reproduce the problem in pure node for throwing socket hang up  wihtout request.abort() under load testing.   I can test the pure node.js for the new problem. but I will only get back to you after a day or few days.
[18:58] eldar has joined the channel
[18:58] eguest309 has left the channel
[18:58] Murvin_: because that problem is about running a load testing, and then leave the server running for days without activity.   so, i don't think I can get back to you on that today.
[18:59] bnoordhuis: Murvin_: no problem, but a pure-node test would help
[18:59] Murvin_: I'm just wondering.. if http.request and http.server use the same socket connection pool.
[18:59] bnoordhuis: easier to reproduce, less stuff in the equation
[19:00] kohai: @maraksquires: http://t.co/t8ByXvK is a distributed #nodejs EventEmitter that works cross process / cross machine / cross environment. (link: https://github.com/marak/hook.io)
[19:00] charleyd: is there a flag for —debug which switches the port the debugger is listening on?
[19:00] Murvin_: sure.   i will run few servers at the same time. One is just a hellow world and leave it running for days.  The other will send http.request.  
[19:02] kohai: @wbyoung: @cgiffard let me know if you get the node.js bindings worked out. It looks really cool!

[19:20] jscheel: afternoon folks! Got a quick question about npm. I have forked a project, and want to include it in my project's package.json dependencies. Does my fork need to have a unique package.json, or should it have the same name, and then just point to the forked repo in my project package.json?
[19:21] isaacs: kriskowal: yeah, that's why i wrote "or suggested"
[19:21] kriskowal: ah
[19:21] TheFuzzball has joined the channel
[19:21] kriskowal: alright, same page.
[19:21] isaacs: kriskowal: you definitely suggest that modules are less-good if they don't do that.
[19:22] isaacs: kriskowal: i'm not prepared to say that :)
[19:22] kriskowal: meh. similar page
[19:22] isaacs: kriskowal: but yeah, i dig that added language there.
[19:22] isaacs: kriskowal: if you want to run in not-node, and not-browserify, yeah, you probably need to be just a define() function and put your module guts in the cb
[19:23] kohai: @samklr: Node.js From the Enterprise Java Perspective http://t.co/KP1HttK (link: http://blog.shinetech.com/?p=394)

[19:27] isaacs: jscheel: hey
[19:27] jscheel: isaacs: hola
[19:27] isaacs: jscheel: so, you have a few options:
[19:27] Bradleymeck_ has joined the channel
[19:27] isaacs: a) get the author to pull the change upstream
[19:28] isaacs: b) bundle your version
[19:28] isaacs: c) give it some different name.
[19:28] isaacs: generally, a is a good choice, followed closely by "b" if "a" is too slow or impractical.  "c" shoudl only be done if it's clear that you are going in different directions.
[19:29] Bradleymeck_ has joined the channel
[19:29] jscheel: isaacs: yeah, I think I will need to go with B
[19:29] jscheel: isaacs: but I'm a little unclear on it
[19:29] isaacs: jscheel: so, what you wanna do is get your version into your node_modules folder (somehow -- use npm link, install the folder/tarball, etc)_
[19:29] jbpros has joined the channel
[19:29] Bradleymeck_ has joined the channel
[19:30] isaacs: jscheel: then in your package.json, do this:  { "dependencies": { "thing" : "version" }, "bundledDependencies" : ["thing"] }
[19:30] kristian-l: what's the best way of implementing a form based authentication in node? Tried several modules but they all seem pretty crude
[19:30] replore_ has joined the channel
[19:30] isaacs: jscheel: then your bundled version will be included in your project when you publish
[19:30] jscheel: isaacs: ahh, cool, lemme give it a whack. Thanks!
[19:30] isaacs: jscheel: you can also do this:   { "dependencies" : { "thing" : "http://github.com/jscheel/node-thing/tarball/tag" }}
[19:31] jscheel: isaacs: ah, that's what I did
[19:31] isaacs: jscheel: then when you do `npm install`, it'll pull from there
[19:31] isaacs: yeah, that's pretty ok
[19:31] jscheel: isaacs: but I wasn't sure what I should do with the package.json
[19:31] isaacs: jscheel: i mean, instead of a version, you can put a url in there.
[19:32] jscheel: isaacs: sorry, I mean the package.json of my forked module
[19:32] isaacs: jscheel: oh, ok
[19:32] davidascher has joined the channel
[19:32] isaacs: jscheel: well, you don't really need to do anything, really

[19:33] jscheel: {"private": true}
[19:33] jscheel: isaacs: cool, thanks

[19:34] ben_alman: i already had my opts and whatnot in a separate object
[19:34] jscheel: isaacs: thanks again!

[19:52] tyrrvk: the docs say $HOME/usr/  
[19:53] Cover|work: /usr/local/ ?
[19:53] tyrrvk: that's what I was wondering
[19:53] tyrrvk: cause if I am logged in as a regular user, and install to ~/$HOME/usr
[19:53] tyrrvk: that'll make it tough for others to log in and run node.js
[19:53] Cover|work: I'd say $HOME/node

[20:33] bnoordhuis: gzmask: it hangs on the cout? that's unlikely
[20:34] gzmask: bnoordhuis: I know, but it does. I comment out the code line by line and it hangs right there. almost feels like a unhandled overflow 
[20:35] gzmask: bnoordhuis: and I separate the code from nodejs/libeio and it works like a charm

[20:44] alessio_alex: thank you bnoordhuis

[22:38] Dinosaurus: 1 min
[22:38] Dinosaurus: i am using
[22:38] Dinosaurus: node_pcap
[22:38] jerrysv: dinosaurus: i dunno, my server has 256 ip's
[22:38] Dinosaurus: you can get src and destination from the tcp packets
[22:39] Dinosaurus: but i want to find the device ip that it listens on

[22:41] jerrysv: dinosaurus: it looks like node pcap tells you the ip address of each interface? http://howtonode.org/capturing-packets-in-javascript
[22:41] jerrysv: dinosaurus: a machine can have any number of interfaces, each interface can have one ip address
[22:41] Dinosaurus: devicename is like wlan0
[22:41] Dinosaurus: not the ip
[22:41] Dinosaurus: packet.link.ip.saddr
[22:41] Dinosaurus: is from the packet
[22:41] Dinosaurus: can't tell which is in and which is out
[22:41] jerrysv: dinosaurus: so wlan0 can have 10.1.1.1 and wlan0:1 can have 10.1.1.2, and wlan0:2 can have 10.1.1.3, etc
[22:42] Dinosaurus: right
[22:42] Dinosaurus: so instead of doing regex on the tcp data, i want to get device ip :X
[22:42] jerrysv: it looks like, from the output of node_pcap, according to the link i just sent, that it is telling you what ip's are bound to each interface
[22:42] Dinosaurus: ?
[22:43] jerrysv: http://howtonode.org/capturing-packets-in-javascript
[22:43] Dinosaurus: packet.link.ip.tcp.etc?

[22:43] jerrysv: yes
[22:43] Dinosaurus: this has source and destination addresses, but it is indeterminate which is the local device
[22:44] kohai: @MaartenJJ: @jakeg82 Nice to meet you too today. We can always talk node.js online, because I'm back in Belgium for a while saturday, sadly.

[22:48] gtramont1na has joined the channel
[22:48] xeodox: Before, everything was working, but I moved the function to another file.
[22:48] xeodox: And exported it out
[22:49] jerrysv: dinosaurus: the problem is that you're not guaranteed to only have one ip
[22:49] jerrysv: so, you'll need a filter list
[22:49] jerrysv: that should be enough to construct one
[22:49] Dinosaurus: the session is created for a device
[22:49] Dinosaurus: ala pcap_session = pcap.createSession("", "tcp and (src port 4000 or dst port 4000)");
[22:49] Dinosaurus: "" means default device
[22:50] jerrysv: then they should all have a length on 1
[22:50] jerrysv: er, of 1
[22:50] Dinosaurus: which should have a length of 1?
[22:51] Luke_: @xedox You are invoking the .prep function inline, not passing it as a reference

[23:15] Marak: isaacs: pquerna says i am going very erlang like with the hook.io
[23:15] jmoyers: clearly node is different
[23:16] isaacs: Marak: yeah, kinda
[23:16] Marak: isaacs: going to add persistance to each hook with nconf, then get global state of i/o 
[23:16] beta_ has joined the channel
[23:16] Marak: isaacs: no central persistance 
[23:16] Marak: global state of i/o tree*
[23:16] Marak: each node combines together to create state
[23:16] Marak: or you get state of node
[23:16] Marak: or its children, etc
[23:17] jmoyers: anyway, most nodejs shit talkers and people who dont know shit about shit

[23:17] jmoyers: knowing shit is like...
[23:17] jmoyers: a lifelong journey and.. shit :-)
[23:19] kohai: @v3ronique: Sitting on a #NodeJS session. I don't know people. Flash has been doing this for years on all browsers.
[23:19] jmoyers: hahaha
[23:19] jmoyers: see what i mean?
[23:19] jmoyers: people who dont know shit about shit
[23:19] jerrysv: hahahahaha
[23:19] jerrysv: silverlight: the next node.js ?
[23:19] jmoyers: i know
[23:19] jmoyers: we should build a vm based on flash
[23:19] jmoyers: that runs on the server
[23:19] jmoyers: AS IN THE CLOUD

[23:23] kohai: @dscape: Good article on node.js vs. erlang. Refreshing seeing someone take a different take on this. "NODE.JS IS BACKWARDS" at http://t.co/pcJBhhN (link: http://blog.ankurgoyal.com/post/6433642218/node-js-is-backwards)

[23:23] jerrysv: marak: is it possible to put a cap on the number of times kohai reposts the same link, just in case something goes viral?
[23:25] kohai: @redhotpenguin: @codeslinger thanks for that link, I've been looking at some node.js code recently.
[23:25] Astro: hi
[23:25] Astro: can anyone tell me the proper podcast feed url for nodetuts.com?
[23:26] Astro: http://feeds.feedburner.com/NodeTuts does not have enclosures

[23:27] Marak: jerrysv: is it spamming?
[23:28] Marak: jerrysv: there is levenstien distance algo for all twitter feeds
[23:28] Marak: !config get plugins:twitter:filter
[23:28] kohai: plugins:twitter:filter is 25
[23:28] Marak: jerrysv: i can increase or decrease the distance
[23:28] Marak: so, take that ;-p
[23:29] Marak: jerrysv: also, i am told in #Node.js room bot wont tweet more then 5 times in 10 minutes.
[23:29] Marak: jerrysv: unless dead silence or @mentions of kohai
[23:29] jerrysv: marak: not quite spamming, since the distance may not be very close in some of these
[23:29] radicality: hi, i'm using express… why won't the following RegExp '/^\/getUsernames\?term\=(\w+)/'  mathc something like '/getUsernames?term=hello'  … express keeps saying 'cannot get ….'
[23:29] jerrysv: marak: it's that damned erlang vs node.js post

[23:31] tjholowaychuk: radicality: req.query contains the querystring obj
[23:31] Marak: !config add plugins:alias:whitelist jerrysv
[23:31] kohai: jerrysv was added to plugins:alias:whitelist.
[23:31] Marak: !config save
[23:31] kohai: Config saved.
[23:31] Marak: its your problem now jerrysv 
[23:31] Marak: :-D
[23:31] Marak: you can set the lev distance all you want
[23:31] tjholowaychuk: radicality: app.get('/getUsernames', fn), and req.query in there
[23:31] Marak: type !help for commands
[23:32] jerrysv: heh, thanks, i think
[23:32] radicality: tjholowaychuk: thanks a lot,…. i was reading the documentaiton and couldn't find it :D
[23:32] Marak: jerrysv: :p
[23:32] jerrysv: if i get time, i'll check out kohai and see if i can add more than just distance checking
[23:32] AvianFlu: !insult jerrysv
[23:32] Calvin: jerrysv tried to steal Cassie's legs.
[23:32] kohai: jerrysv is an unsightly trouser stain!
[23:33] jerrysv: !insult AvianFLu
[23:33] kohai: AvianFLu smells of elderberry wine!
[23:33] Calvin: AvianFLu liked BSG, even after the first two seasons.
[23:33] Marak: jerrysv: we are doing refactor of kohai to use hook.io. if you want to improve a kohai plugin, that is good you can do that. if you want to create new plugin or make changes to core kohai, you should be doing that in hook.io
[23:33] kohai: @twitinsin: I like that there's a node.js bot which funnels the tweets of haters, fanboys, hipsters and get-off-my-lawners alike into the IRC channel.
[23:33] jerrysv: marak: will do. checked out hook.io last night, in concept it sounded like something i had done a while back, but in practice it is much more
[23:34] Marak: !tweet @twitinsin It can also talk shit back to you.
[23:34] kohai: @NodeKohai: @twitinsin It can also talk shit back to you.

[23:34] insin: Welcome... to the desert of the real O_o
[23:35] Dinosaurus: Marak is your goal to spam in every corner of the interbutt
[23:35] insin: ACTION just wishes he had an interesting project to play with something like hook.io in
