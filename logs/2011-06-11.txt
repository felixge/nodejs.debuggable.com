[00:02] blaenk: mape: sorry?
[00:02] mape: blaenk: don't worry, coffeescript isn't that bad
[00:02] blaenk: mape: I'm wondering how I can run the coffeescript interpreter
[00:03] blaenk: with node.js in the environment, that is, run the coffeescript interpreter and use node.js in it
[00:03] varioust has joined the channel
[00:03] jble has joined the channel
[00:03] slickplaid: blaenk, what I do is install it globally using `npm install -g coffeescript`
[00:03] Corren has joined the channel
[00:03] slickplaid: then just run any .coffee file like `coffee server.coffee`
[00:03] slickplaid: and it works(tm)
[00:04] blaenk: ohhhh sorry guys, the coffee script interpreter already has access to node, the problem I was having is requiring a file in the directory
[00:04] blaenk: so like I run the coffee repl in a directory with the source files and I want to require them
[00:04] blaenk: yeah that's the problem
[00:04] blaenk: I think if I go back one directory it'll work
[00:04] blaenk: nope doesn't
[00:05] blaenk: so, when I run coffee thefile.coffee it works just fine
[00:05] blaenk: but what I'm trying to do is run coffee REPL and do require calls etc. myself
[00:05] blaenk: like one would test things really quickly in irb
[00:05] AvianFlu: slickplaid: I like the works(tm)
[00:05] bitwise_: maybe try putting them in ./node_modules?
[00:05] blaenk: it works with require 'http', but not with my own files
[00:05] slickplaid: :)
[00:05] jble has joined the channel
[00:06] blaenk: well I didn't have to put them in node_modules when I ran with coffee
[00:06] bitwise_: ah. just in the cs repl?
[00:06] blaenk: require just automatically seemed to find the files in the same directory
[00:06] blaenk: yeah exactly
[00:06] blaenk: so I have a /coffee dir with my coffee files, and I want to test files
[00:06] blaenk: in the repl just on the fly you know

[00:08] blaenk: cannot find module rather
[00:08] blaenk: and I'm in /, I even tried it within /coffee by doing require './foo' and same
[00:08] bitwise_: this was happening to me before when i was using the node repl using sudo
[00:08] blaenk: is it because somehow my current directory is changed when I run the coffee repl?
[00:08] leed0 has left the channel
[00:08] cl0udy has joined the channel
[00:08] blaenk: yeah something like that? except I'm not running it with sudo, though I did install it globally

[00:11] blaenk: https://gist.github.com/1020065
[00:11] blaenk: that's most likely the reason

[00:13] paul_k has joined the channel

[00:14] blaenk: thanks. NODE_PATH env var might help I think, time to search
[00:17] mwhooker has joined the channel
[00:17] blaenk: yeah it's a problem with coffeescript because when I run node directly it works

[00:35] isaacs: npm ls -g

[00:35] blaenk: right -g
[00:35] isaacs: npm explore coffee-script -g would explore the global one

[00:56] kmiyashiro: wtf is design by contract
[00:56] _Beau: i think its something like, if i dont like your design i wont pay you?
[00:56] _Beau: :D
[00:56] Aria: Say what it does. Then do that. Checks at the entrance and exit of every method.
[00:57] Aria: "this method's contract says that if you give it two integers, it'll give you one back, and won't throw any exceptions"
[00:57] stepheneb has joined the channel
[00:57] kmiyashiro: isn't that just a test?
[00:58] dominictarr: it is like a test.
[00:58] dominictarr: but it runs everytime you call a function.
[00:58] dominictarr: so it's like user defined static types.

[01:01] jmoyers: not that i don't know what static typing is
[01:01] jmoyers: but im confused why i would ever do that in js
[01:01] kmiyashiro: so it tests your entire codebase with the tests you write for each function?
[01:02] kmiyashiro: not sure I understand completely
[01:02] asobrasil has joined the channel
[01:03] dominictarr: well, I mean that it checking all your objects are corect, at run time, like static typing would.
[01:03] dominictarr: normally it means defining pre and post conditions for each method call.
[01:04] Aria: Yeah. Or more, documenting the conditions everything expects and what it will or won't do in response.
[01:04] dominictarr: yeah. 
[01:04] Aria: It can be as code or as documentation, but the contract is essentially a more detailed API spec.
[01:04] jmoyers: documentation = fine
[01:04] jmoyers: code = go get a statically typed language
[01:04] jmoyers: imo
[01:05] dominictarr: it's too late, already doing js.

[01:06] jmoyers: thats fine -- im just not doing it. i don't prescribe what others need to do :-) seems like a lot of overhead
[01:06] tauren: i'm curious, what types of modules do people install globally vs locally? When does it make sense to do one over the other?
[01:06] jmoyers: tauren only modules with cli utilities in global generally
[01:06] jmoyers: coffeescript, express if you use that, etc
[01:07] _Beau: and also if you are providing hosting environments or something
[01:07] azend has joined the channel
[01:07] steffan has joined the channel
[01:07] tauren: so in general, install most of your modules locally?
[01:07] _Beau: yes, jmoyers has it
[01:07] _Beau: i do.
[01:07] themiddleman has joined the channel
[01:07] jmoyers: tauren yes
[01:07] jmoyers: always
[01:07] _Beau: since theres no reason not to, and im the only one on my server
[01:07] jmoyers: if you're doing development
[01:07] _Beau: esp. since you can now
[01:07] jmoyers: actively on another library (ie one of your dependencies)
[01:07] _Beau: didnt used to be able to if i'm not mistaken, even 3 months ago
[01:07] jmoyers: it can be nice to use npm link
[01:07] tauren: ok. but things like express would be global then?
[01:07] jmoyers: which is pseudo global
[01:08] tauren: npm install express
[01:08] jmoyers: tauren only if you're using the cli part of express
[01:08] _Beau: tauren: i would install all things to a local place
[01:08] xerox: SubStack: where is .map(..) from ?
[01:08] _Beau: as to prevent conflicts with other projects/users
[01:08] tauren: does that automatically install globally, as that's how they recommend installing it? I thought I had to add a -g to install globally.
[01:08] _Beau: and not necessarly in your project folder
[01:08] _Beau: but like your /home/tauren/ dir
[01:08] _Beau: is what i do
[01:09] SubStack: xerox: traverse has a .amp()
[01:09] tauren: ok, thanks
[01:09] SubStack: *map
[01:09] _Beau: it can help you keep track of what the packages are easier, as well as preserve dependancies
[01:09] erictj has joined the channel
[01:09] tauren: so you just install them once for all your projects and use npm link to reference them?
[01:09] _Beau: well, whatever location your at when you npm install package
[01:09] _Beau: is where it goes
[01:09] _Beau: you dont need to link/reference
[01:09] davidbanham: I think global installation definitely has a place for things like nodemon
[01:09] _Beau: its auto
[01:10] SubStack: design by contract is silly
[01:10] _Beau: david: why?
[01:10] SubStack: just avoid side effects except where appropriate
[01:10] SubStack: problem solved
[01:10] Aria: Agreed.
[01:10] xerox: SubStack: ah I see
[01:10] davidbanham: _Beau: Because it's something I want access to in pretty much every project during development, but I may not want to use it in production.
[01:11] xerox: I think I saw a functional programming inspired package sometime
[01:11] SubStack: xerox: it's because uglify's ast walker is crap
[01:11] xerox: but I can't find it anymore
[01:11] SubStack: so I'm using my awesome one that is for any kind of data structure
[01:11] xerox: hehe
[01:11] tauren: _Beau: jmoyers: thanks for the help. I've been installing locally, but just wondered if I should be installing anything globally. now i know.
[01:11] jmoyers: and knowing is half the battle

[01:13] SubStack: isaacs: well I can do in 5 lines with traverse what it takes dozens of lines with uglify's walker
[01:13] isaacs: yeah
[01:13] isaacs: traverse is pretty nice, too

[01:15] tjholowaychuk: no prob

[01:44] Matt111 has joined the channel
[01:44] chjj: yes
[01:44] davidbanham: Danish: Yes. Depending on what you want it to do, it may or may not be the best choice, but yes.
[01:44] chjj: i like my answer better
[01:44] Danish: well I wanted to make a multiplayer game
[01:45] davidbanham: chjj: I've been hanging out with too many lawyers.
[01:45] Danish: a small mmo
[01:45] Danish: so you have a map and you walk around and see other players
[01:46] edude03 has joined the channel
[01:46] davidbanham: Danish: Pretty real-time, so yeah nodejs would probably be a good choice in my reasonably uneducated opinion.
[01:46] Matt111: Danish - make it interesting.. everyone is a server, P2P based..  The only way in is to connect to another player.
[01:46] Matt111: no central repo, it would make for an epic RPG :)
[01:46] Danish: hmmm
[01:47] Danish: how would I go about doing that?
[01:47] Matt111: Thats my nerdy idea though, not the best if you have non-techies playing
[01:47] jmoyers: not viable
[01:47] jmoyers: unless cheating is okay
[01:47] Matt111: good point
[01:47] Danish: well not many players would be cheating since its a smart phone game
[01:47] davidbanham: jmoyers: Make cheating an integral part of the game. Whomever can hack their local server in the most interesting ways is the winner.
[01:48] Danish: plus i just want to do this to learn some client-server programming
[01:48] Matt111: lol
[01:48] blaenk: I've been reading up on something related to Danish' question, but mine isn't as complicated, it's just a turn-based multiplayer game (10 players or less per game), the thing I'm looking into is what protocol, like, just straight up tcp and make up my own or something like socket.io
[01:48] jmoyers: uh
[01:48] blaenk: I'm also new to that stuff
[01:48] jmoyers: is it browser based?
[01:48] blaenk: it'll be an iOS app
[01:48] jmoyers: if so, socket.io
[01:48] Danish: well
[01:48] ebryn has joined the channel
[01:48] Danish: the idea is to make the game available to different platforms
[01:49] Danish: so write 1 server
[01:49] Matt111: Danish - everyone launches a server, and the server speaks to the node it joined from.  From there it asks that server for nodes its connected to.. slowly polling all the servers to ensure the web of connections is always growing.
[01:49] Danish: and 2 different clients
[01:49] Danish: one for the web
[01:49] jmoyers: then you abstract the transport
[01:49] Danish: and 1 for the app
[01:49] davidbanham: Danish: Considered doing it in Javascript nose to tail and then deploying with PhoneGap?
[01:49] jmoyers: use the same data types (json, whatever), and abstract the to-network/from-network
[01:49] blaenk: I found this for iOS https://github.com/fpotter/socketio-cocoa
[01:49] blaenk: it's an interface between cocoa and socket.io
[01:50] jmoyers: our product uses udp, tcp/http/bayeaux depending on the circumstances
[01:52] asobrasil has joined the channel
[01:52] jmoyers: careful about dependencies
[01:52] jmoyers: especially non-so-well-known libraries dealing with network voodoo
[01:52] jmoyers: unless you're prepared to debug, in which case its fine
[01:53] jmoyers: i just question the need to use socket.io in that context
[01:53] Danish: i just looked at phoneGap
[01:53] Danish: looks pretty cool
[01:54] blaenk: yeah I'm currently looking at plain old tcp
[01:54] Danish: well if I use phonegap and a p2p network i wouldnt need to even touch node js, right?
[01:55] blaenk: I'm new to network programming I just thought socket.io might ease things, but it seems like plain tcp is more direct
[01:55] SubStack: those do different things
[01:55] blaenk: hahaha I know, not what I meant :/
[01:55] blaenk: I meant building on top of a tcp stream or just using socket.io
[01:56] blaenk: and this is not related to a web app
[01:56] SubStack: you only use socket.io for browser<->server code
[01:56] chjj: youre making very confusing statements
[01:56] blaenk: I know that's why I dropped it
[01:56] blaenk: though I did find that cocoa/ios bridge to socket.io
[01:57] jmoyers: SubStack well
[01:57] davidbanham: Danish: True, a P2P system will not require nodejs. I'd say the technical challenge of a P2P system will be greater than that of a server-client system though.
[01:57] jmoyers: i guess some would argue that
[01:57] blaenk: but like I'm saying, socket.io didn't seem to fit
[01:57] jmoyers: its just a protocol
[01:57] jmoyers: ~j~ etc
[01:58] jmoyers: blaenk i'd look directly at http://code.google.com/p/cocoaasyncsocket/
[01:58] jmoyers: if i were you
[01:58] blaenk: yeah I had that up too
[01:58] blaenk: that + a tcp server? (again I'm noob)
[01:59] blaenk: so I mean that on the ios app, and a tcp server on node.js

[02:01] cafesofie has joined the channel
[02:01] jmoyers: yes, you can choose json
[02:01] jmoyers: on the iOS device though
[02:01] renatoi has joined the channel
[02:01] jmoyers: you need a library to deserialize
[02:01] jmoyers: with node
[02:01] blaenk: a json library, yeah
[02:01] jmoyers: you just use JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse()
[02:01] blaenk: sweet
[02:02] renatoi: hey, can anyone help me with http headers in node.js?
[02:02] jmoyers: shoot
[02:02] blaenk: yeah I am thinking I will need channels (to represent separate games, each which have different players). so i'd have to implement that myself if I use a net server, I found this which might help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4445883/node-websocket-server-possible-to-have-multiple-separate-broadcasts-for-a-sin
[02:03] blaenk: to give me an idea
[02:03] jmoyers: erm
[02:03] catshirt has joined the channel
[02:03] jmoyers: not to cap on PushIt
[02:04] jmoyers: but you don't necessarily need this
[02:04] _Beau: no
[02:04] blaenk: oh that answer suggests pushit but I was refering mainly to the sample code
[02:04] blaenk: on how one might implement channels
[02:04] jmoyers: if you need channels, you might check out modules that do 'namespaced events'
[02:04] jmoyers: for pub sub
[02:04] _Beau: i use DNode for pub/sub
[02:04] jmoyers: for instance https://github.com/hij1nx/EventEmitter2
[02:04] _Beau: https://github.com/sorensen/aebleskiver
[02:04] _Beau: is pub/sub channel chat app
[02:05] _Beau: the source code might help you figure things out
[02:05] blaenk: thanks, opened both of those up
[02:05] _Beau: it wont be multi-threaded until the subscriptions/channels are moved to a persistant DB though
[02:05] _Beau: as an FYI
[02:05] jmoyers: not true
[02:05] jmoyers: you don't need persistence to make a multi server message queue
[02:06] _Beau: its really just an FYI that something needs to change
[02:06] _Beau: in order to communicate between node processes
[02:06] renatoi: http.request: I have more than one "Link" header in my http response header and nodejs is returning me just the first "LINK" header in response.headers. Is this a known bug? Any idea?
[02:06] _Beau: the method on how it is done is somewhat subjective
[02:07] jmoyers: but anyway -- dnode isn't ported to ios natively yet
[02:07] jmoyers: its got an open protocol
[02:07] ap3mantus has joined the channel
[02:07] _Beau: while we are on the subject
[02:07] _Beau: my solution was just going to be using visionmedia/Keys to share subs/channels
[02:08] _Beau: is using a MQ a better solution?
[02:08] _Beau: as i want to use cluster in the near future
[02:08] jmoyers: there are a bunch of domain specific mq technologies
[02:08] jmoyers: rabbit, redis pub/sub, etc
[02:08] _Beau: Keys can use redis/mongodb/riak
[02:08] cole has joined the channel
[02:09] _Beau: and as i want to make it incorporated into a backbone-dnode package, i feel Keys might be a more versitile solution to the end user of the package
[02:09] jmoyers: does Keys support redis pub sub out of the box?
[02:09] _Beau: not the native pub/sub of redis
[02:09] jmoyers: im not really sure i understand going to riak or mongo or some such for a message queue
[02:09] jmoyers: so write events into the database and poll?
[02:10] _Beau: im currently storing Clients/Channels/Subscriptions in thread-memory
[02:10] jmoyers: the benefit of redis pub/sub or rabbit etc is that they're push, and optionally have persistence
[02:10] _Beau: i just figured moving to Keys would solve that regardless of what i use, so long as its not Memory
[02:10] _Beau: i dont have any experience using MQ's
[02:11] fljitovak has joined the channel
[02:11] jmoyers: well
[02:11] cl0udy has joined the channel
[02:11] jmoyers: unless you use somethin akin to mysql triggers
[02:11] _Beau: not at all
[02:11] jmoyers: im not sure how you can make a generic datastore into a pub sub without polling
[02:12] _Beau: why poll?
[02:12] dshaw_ has joined the channel
[02:12] blaenk: hey quick noob question. I'm wondering how something like redis pub/sub fits into a net server (nodejs), like, I would have thought redis would help to add persistence for example, but what does the pub/sub element of redis help with? I'm just wondering if it'll help with what I'm trying to do
[02:13] blaenk: oh you guys are saying, message queue, right
[02:13] _Beau: redis has a native publish/subscribe method that will do the job
[02:13] _Beau: in which, you arent sending EVERY message to EVERYONE
[02:13] jmoyers: you dont need a dedicated message queue unless you have multiple servers that are interested in events
[02:14] blaenk: ohhh, so instead of implementing it myself in a net server, a client would just connect to the redis server? or would a nodejs app mediate the connection?
[02:14] jmoyers: no no
[02:14] jmoyers: like
[02:14] _Beau: jmoyers: i will butcher this explanation
[02:14] dshaw_1 has joined the channel
[02:15] jmoyers: in short
[02:15] jmoyers: you probably don't need a message queue
[02:15] blaenk: I'll give a quick run down of what I want to do and maybe you can tell me
[02:15] SubStack: quit thinking, start hacking
[02:15] blaenk: haha I'd rather not get deep into something only to find out I'm doing it wrong
[02:16] SubStack: if you find out you're doing it wrong then you throw it away
[02:16] SubStack: and you learned something!
[02:16] blaenk: lol, yeah I don't mind that but I might as well ask people who know
[02:16] SubStack: much faster I find to just start building something
[02:17] blaenk: I already have started writing a lot but this pub/sub thing caught my attention
[02:17] rpj8 has joined the channel
[02:17] blaenk: its a turn based multiplayer game. chatting is part of the game mechanic (the players have to be able to chat with each other to discuss the events, cooperate etc.)
[02:17] SubStack: that sounds hard. use dnode
[02:17] blaenk: hahaha
[02:18] mqsack_ has joined the channel
[02:18] _Beau: :D
[02:18] _Beau: and backbone!
[02:18] _Beau: and while your at it, backbone-dnode!
[02:18] SubStack: sure
[02:18] _Beau: somewhat joking about the last part, but DNode for sure
[02:19] blaenk: to give a very quick rundown. the server will manage the game state. players each have different roles, and the server announces new 'phases' in which players can choose to use their abilities. so during a certain phase, players might choose to use their abilities. the actions will be gathered by the server, and then at the start of the next phase they will be run, and their effects will alter the game state
[02:19] rpj8: Is the solution posted by shripad generally the best way to go about this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4753957/socket-io-authentication/4782933
[02:19] rpj8: ?
[02:19] mqsack_: anyone have time for a noob failed install error question?
[02:19] rpj8: AUGH I HAVE NO TIME
[02:19] rpj8: ACTION sits in irc chatroom
[02:20] sechrist has joined the channel
[02:20] blaenk: so for example during the day people may chat, then during the night, bad people might choose to kill someone, etc., the server will gather those actions (kill someone), and then evaluate them at the end of the night
[02:20] blaenk: I'm guessing I don't need an mq then haha
[02:20] _Beau: rpj8: yes
[02:20] rpj8: blaenk: lol are you remaking epic mafia?
[02:20] _Beau: its what i am currently doing with connect-mongodb
[02:20] rpj8: _Beau: alright, cool.
[02:20] blaenk: rpj8: sure something like mafia
[02:21] rpj8: _Beau: I am going to look into dnode next to see if it offers another solution
[02:21] _Beau: it doesnt
[02:21] _Beau: to my knowledge
[02:21] rpj8: ah
[02:21] rpj8: I see
[02:21] _Beau: you will need to send the client the session ID sent by express, since it is hashed+salted
[02:21] SubStack: auth is hard
[02:21] SubStack: (not really)
[02:21] unlink has joined the channel
[02:21] _Beau: and after that, you can use socket.io to query the SessionStore with that SID
[02:22] _Beau: there is more to it than that, but that will get you started in a big way towards your goal
[02:22] SubStack: rpj8: you can write a unique token in some javascript
[02:22] rpj8: _Beau: I see. I've never worked directly with the sessionstore yet
[02:22] rpj8: _Beau: I've always just done req.session.name = 'body.name' 
[02:22] rpj8: set it and forget it.
[02:22] _Beau: its not too hard, yes same here
[02:22] SubStack: <script>var token = !{JSON.stringify(token)}</script>
[02:22] SubStack: then send that to the server over socket.io
[02:23] _Beau: exactly
[02:23] _Beau: did i say it wrong substack?
[02:23] SubStack: much easier than connect-redis
[02:23] _Beau: well, if your working with express isnt it all the same idea?
[02:23] _Beau: connect-redis/connect-mongodb/native express sessions
[02:23] rpj8: SubStack: what significance is the ! in that line
[02:23] _Beau: express sets the hashed SID
[02:23] SubStack: you don't necessarily need the session id
[02:24] SubStack: rpj8: interpolation
[02:24] rpj8: oh with jade
[02:24] _Beau: which will allow you to keep the same token for later use in express routes
[02:24] SubStack: yes except the <script> parts obviously aren't jade
[02:24] SubStack: but it's just the idea of it
[02:24] _Beau: i have a jade demo
[02:24] _Beau: if u want
[02:25] rpj8: you konw
[02:25] rpj8: i'd only ever heard of interpolation before in GIS
[02:25] zomgbie has joined the channel
[02:25] rpj8: and then I heard it suddenly when tj mentioned it in using it in jade templates
[02:25] _Beau: https://github.com/sorensen/aebleskiver/blob/master/views/index.jade
[02:25] rpj8: which was kind of weird
[02:25] _Beau: loc 445
[02:25] _Beau: is where i set it
[02:25] okuryu has joined the channel
[02:25] _Beau: and then just grab it on the client and use it at will
[02:25] rpj8: _Beau: thank you
[02:26] _Beau: check the server.js file for how i'm sending it to jade, but its pretty straightforward
[02:26] rpj8: ok cool
[02:26] rpj8: thank you so much
[02:26] rpj8: afk a little
[02:26] _beau: fo sho

[02:30] _beau: i've come across a chuck of change or so
[02:30] _beau: never owned anything apple
[02:31] mikegerwitz: You pay out the ass for vendor lock, imo
[02:31] _beau: i guess in reference to hardware/performance
[02:31] _beau: not too concerned with the company ethics
[02:31] mikegerwitz: That I can't say ;)
[02:32] _beau: since Acer has terrible customer service
[02:32] SubStack: I don't like macbooks

[02:32] jmoyers: i <3 my macbook
[02:32] SubStack: such big touchpads
[02:32] SubStack: I hate touchpads
[02:32] chjj: this^
[02:32] SubStack: ACTION has a thinkpad
[02:32] _beau: i kind of like the big touchpads, i hate touchpads as well, but it might be because they are so small?
[02:32] SubStack: clitmouse ftw
[02:32] _beau: LOL
[02:33] _beau: i dev on a thinkpad at work
[02:33] jmoyers: ha
[02:33] jmoyers: gestures ftw
[02:33] jmoyers: more like
[02:33] _beau: ^^
[02:33] chjj: ill die before i use a touchpad
[02:33] _beau: my manager does VIM / touchpad and is crazy fast
[02:33] SubStack: also I don't get the appeal of osx's interface
[02:33] mikegerwitz: For the price of the hardware, you can get the same performance for much cheaper. I'd take the extra money and invest in an external monitor :) Increase productivity. That's my main gripe with laptops. One screen.
[02:33] SubStack: every time I try to use it I end up very frustrated
[02:33] jmoyers: heh
[02:33] SubStack: same with smartphones
[02:33] _beau: i always have a second moniter plugged in
[02:33] jmoyers: well it certainly takes a few to get used to
[02:34] jmoyers: but i'll never go back to main dev on windows
[02:34] _beau: i am just sick of windows i guess
[02:34] SubStack: ACTION runs xmonad on linux
[02:34] _beau: and still hate apple for no reason
[02:34] mikegerwitz: SubStack++ ;)
[02:34] jmoyers: parse fail
[02:34] _beau: since i've never used an apple product since i was in the 5th grade
[02:34] mikegerwitz: guess so.
[02:35] _beau: i've been told it is a superior hardware
[02:35] jmoyers: there is no reason to hate apple
[02:35] _beau: vs. my Acer for example
[02:35] chjj: jmoyers: yes there is
[02:35] _beau: ^^
[02:35] jmoyers: nah
[02:35] mikegerwitz: There's countless reasons to hate apple. But more for business ethics than hardware.
[02:35] blaenk: I like apple but I like to troll apple fanboys and apple haters both, it's too easy
[02:35] _beau: hehe
[02:35] jmoyers: i use both
[02:35] SubStack: I like apple but I don't like their interfaces
[02:35] blaenk: people make that shit their religion, taking one stance about the issue
[02:35] _beau: i just hate the unknown
[02:35] SubStack: or their hardware
[02:35] chjj: refusing to support webm like a stubborn child = failure in my eyes

[02:37] blaenk: I usually use windows but when it comes to dev, I boot into mac
[02:38] _beau: i've been on windows since 3.1
[02:38] chjj: jmoyers: yeah, google is the bad guy, youre right
[02:38] blaenk: no need to buy overpriced mac hardware (though I do have various apple products including a macbook), and I get the os (I did buy it :)
[02:38] mikegerwitz: _beau: all went downhill since 3.1 :(
[02:38] jmoyers: nah, they aren't -- im just saying, thrusting those standards out without feedback from the major players
[02:38] jmoyers: that was risky

[02:41] rpj8: it's making more sense today though
[02:41] _beau: the project? i forgot what i told you yesterday
[02:41] rpj8: it was about the same thing
[02:41] rpj8: how to 'tie' sessions to socket.io connections
[02:42] mikegerwitz: _beau: Well, what's your interest in a Mac? The interface? The brand? All the cool kids have it? It's not Windows?
[02:42] _beau: not windows mainly
[02:42] rpj8: i did a _lot_ more reading on the subject and I understand it a bit better now.
[02:42] _beau: i dont give a fuck about 'cool'
[02:42] rpj8: _beau: you should run linux
[02:42] rpj8: like all the uncool not-windows kids
[02:42] mikegerwitz: _beau: Experiment with gnu/linux then before you blow all your money :)
[02:42] _beau: quality of hardware?
[02:42] mikegerwitz: _beau: if you don't like that, then try a mac
[02:42] _beau: i can afford 2 macbooks a week
[02:43] _beau: so im kinda not worried about the $$
[02:43] _beau: maybe even just having different platforms to know the differences

[04:24] Aria: 0.x vs 1.x, kinda.
[04:25] saschagehlich has joined the channel
[04:26] zodiak: Aria: ah, sorry, let me clarify. I mean when doing a npm install, I want sqlite3 to load on dev, but if missing the --dev flag, then get npm install to install pg
[04:27] Aria: No, there's not.
[04:28] Aria: You could script that, though, instead -- generate your package.json, or script the npm install itself.
[04:28] zodiak: true
[04:28] Aria: node install.js # runs npm install && npm install sqlite3 if dev, else npm install pg
[04:28] zodiak: I was merely wondering if there was a 'typical' way that I was missing. 
[04:29] Aria: Yeah. Nope.
[04:29] zodiak: alrighty. danke :)
[04:29] Aria: Myself, I'd install both every time.
[04:29] Aria: And then choose which to _use_ at runtime.
[04:30] zodiak: Aria: yeah, true, problem comes with sqlite3 borks on heroku (which I am playing with rather than joyent … mea culpa ;)
[04:30] dgathright has joined the channel
[04:30] Aria: Ah, sad!
[04:30] zodiak: meh.. I am jst glad that work has allowed me time to play with node, even if it is 'use heroku' :)

[04:30] SubStack: what is that

[04:35] Aria: In most states, work at the company or on company projects or company equipment, it's company time.
[04:35] Aria: Otherwise not.
[04:35] Aria: But in new york, it's all company time.

[04:54] nonoders: what's the best way to clean out that install entirely?
[04:55] nonoders: Or I suppose what's just the best way to uninstall node completely
[04:55] nonoders: in preparation for installing the lastes
[04:55] nonoders: *latest
[04:56] Aria: sudo make uninstall?
[04:56] nonoders: I don't have the original makefile
[04:56] nonoders: (or at least i cannot locate it) (Aria)
[04:56] Aria: Delete all the files?
[04:56] Aria: Or just install over the top?
[04:56] Aria: node isn't complex. There's not much to it.
[04:57] nonoders: Aria: do you know where all the files node drops are?
[04:58] Aria: Where'd you tell it to install to? It's mostly just the node binary and libdir/node/libraries
[04:58] Aria: (and in my case, a shared library, but I had to work to make that happen in the first place.)
[04:59] nonoders: Aria: this was about 8 months ago
[05:00] nonoders: I just read that installing as root was dangerous
[05:00] Aria: It's not.
[05:00] Matt111: bring an idiot as root is dangerous.
[05:01] Matt111: installing programs that are safe is not.
[05:01] Aria: No more than doing anything as root is.
[05:01] Aria: I mean, on my workstation, I own /usr/local, so I don't have to. But my server, I install as root.
[05:01] Aria: now npm, since it's been reworked as 1.0, you don't tend to install things as root (but it has features to make that safe -- running mostly as nobody) since they're project-local.
[05:02] Matt111: ahh, I run my macbook, I've never had a reason to use root at home.  on servers root is useful for initial config though.
[05:03] nonoders: Well, I thought it was dangerous to install npm as root because of untrusted npm packages
[05:03] nonoders: that made sense tome
[05:04] Matt111: hmm, that does make sense if its an untrusted package - I joined in the convo late.
[05:06] nonoders: It looks like I did some hacky stuff. I think I installed as me:
[05:06] nonoders: but /usr/local is owned by my username
[05:06] nonoders: not root
[05:06] perezd has joined the channel
[05:06] nonoders: normally it's root
[05:06] thinkt4nk has joined the channel
[05:06] nonoders: Must have just been trying to make sure it wasn't owned by root and made that entire dir owned by me. I wonder if I screwed anything up
[05:06] nonoders: (probably only if someone else tries to use my personal computer)
[05:08] nonoders: So I took the "take ownership" approach it looks like
[05:08] nonoders: Why the heck aren't there just binaries of node for every platform?

[05:18] SubStack: Marak: I feel pretty likewise today
[05:18] OMGIMANERD: has anyone used node with any ruby on rails applications?
[05:18] SubStack: had 4 mugs of coffee and I'm not any less sleepy than when I woke up
[05:18] SubStack: that said I still got plenty done today
[05:18] Aria: Time to give up caffeine for a couple weeks so it works again.
[05:19] Marak: SubStack: :-) i just woke up and sechrist and avianflu were here
[05:19] SubStack: maybe
[05:19] SubStack: or I accidentally bought decaf mebs
[05:19] nonoders: OMGIMANERD: One time I wrote a nodejs script that deleted every single ruby file on my hard drive.
[05:19] nonoders: And I was glad
[05:19] SubStack: nope
[05:20] mt3ck_: haha
[05:20] OMGIMANERD: damn...
[05:20] nonoders: Seriously.. why?
[05:20] nonoders: If you're starting from scratch, why choose to use ruby?
[05:20] OMGIMANERD: does it not work well with ruby?
[05:21] OMGIMANERD: whats your suggestion
[05:21] SubStack: OMGIMANERD: seems a bit silly to use node and ruby in the same app unless you have a specific reason to
[05:21] ebryn_ has joined the channel
[05:21] SubStack: when you could just as well write everything in either language entirely
[05:22] OMGIMANERD: haha
[05:22] OMGIMANERD: what about real time pushes?
[05:22] SubStack: is there anything in particular that you need ruby for or is it just familiarity?
[05:23] ebryn_ has joined the channel
[05:24] OMGIMANERD: i already have a web app built with RoR
[05:24] nonoders: OMGIMANERD Either language can be used to do real time pushes
[05:24] nonoders: Even java could be used to do it
[05:24] SubStack: realtime pushups
[05:24] nonoders: Do what you like, but don't use ruby out of familiarity
[05:25] nonoders: SubStack: oh in that case, yes use ruby for real time pushups
[05:25] OMGIMANERD: say i started from scratch
[05:25] nonoders: then node
[05:25] brainproxy: OMGIMANERD: there are lots of fun options for "real time" push libs in node.js
[05:25] nonoders: node node node all the way
[05:25] brainproxy: faye, socket.io
[05:25] nonoders: :)
[05:25] brainproxy: SubStack: has dnode, iirc
[05:25] SubStack: dnode can speak ruby
[05:25] Aria: ACTION submits a pull request to homebrew to update nodejs
[05:25] SubStack: although I haven't put too much work into it
[05:25] nonoders: dnode the rpc framework?
[05:25] nonoders: what?
[05:25] SubStack: yes
[05:26] nonoders: You mean you can use dnode to connect ruby and node?
[05:26] brainproxy: faye as well
[05:26] brainproxy: can connect ruby and node
[05:26] brainproxy: through pub/sub mechanism
[05:27] nonoders: Hey SubStack/brainproxy have you guys heard of any good ways of seamlessly sharing code from the client and server?
[05:27] brainproxy: nonoders: well I have my preference :)
[05:27] brainproxy: which is to build cross-environment libs with Joose
[05:27] sudhirjonathan has joined the channel
[05:27] nonoders: what are your thoughts brainproxy ?
[05:27] brainproxy: ^^
[05:27] nonoders: Okay
[05:28] brainproxy: but Joose makes some folks scratch their heads, so ymmv
[05:28] OMGIMANERD: nonoders how long have you been using node
[05:28] nonoders: But what about modeling dependencies with npm 
[05:28] nonoders: OMGIMANERD: not much
[05:28] SubStack: nonoders: have I...
[05:28] isaacs: OMGIMANERD: since 2009
[05:28] nonoders: I just know that the more languages in your stack the worse
[05:28] brainproxy: nonoders: well with Joose you use a mechanism called JooseX.Namespace.Depended
[05:28] OMGIMANERD: LOL and why is that
[05:28] SubStack: nonoders: http://github.com/substack/node-browserify
[05:28] brainproxy: ^^

[05:29] isaacs: you'll type "require('jewsex')" some day, i promose.
[05:30] Marak: lol
[05:30] nonoders: OMGIMANERD: You will end up writing the same code twice
[05:30] nonoders: someway some where
[05:30] nonoders: and you will struggle with bugs when they get out of sync
[05:30] nonoders: SubStack: what about requirejs?
[05:31] brainproxy: seriously, though, the orthogonality provided by Roles in Joose and the flexibility of JooseX.Namaespace.Depended make it possible to break your code down into little chunks
[05:31] brainproxy: which really appeals to me
[05:31] sechrist has joined the channel
[05:32] nonoders: brainproxy: you know what else allows you to break code into small chunks? javascript
[05:32] nonoders: json objects
[05:32] nonoders: nothing more is needed in my opinion unless you wish to do inheritane
[05:32] nonoders: *inheritance
[05:33] brainproxy: i'm talking more about class compisition

[05:34] nonoders: with proto inheri
[05:35] jmoyers: classical inheritance can be useful
[05:35] brainproxy: well something things can still get messy w/ proto inheritance .. but I've learned to not evangelize Joose too hard in js community, tends to elicit strong reactions :)

[06:20] SubStack: you can get tremendously fancy
[06:20] Marak: function () {                     self.request(id, [].slice.apply(arguments));                 } 
[06:20] SubStack: just return statements don't work
[06:20] SubStack: by design
[06:20] Marak: im expecting what i pasted to be my fn
[06:21] SubStack: oh yes that
[06:21] SubStack: functions only execute on the side they are defined on
[06:21] Marak: SubStack: so i literally want to pass a FN as the argument
[06:21] SubStack: dnode makes shim functions that are actually rpc calls back to the other side
[06:21] Marak: like, i need the FN in tact on the side to manipulate it
[06:21] Marak: not dnode magic it
[06:21] Marak: it should be considered data here
[06:22] SubStack: you can fn.toString() it
[06:22] Marak: yeah, thats what i was thinking
[06:22] SubStack: then Function(fnString) on the other end
[06:22] Marak: wanted to confirm with you first
[06:22] Marak: yeah, thats kinda lame for my api
[06:22] Marak: but acceptable
[06:22] SubStack: why do you need to do such things?
[06:23] chjj: [].slice.call is evil!
[06:23] SubStack: chjj: pfft whatevs
[06:23] chjj: :)
[06:24] chjj: i used to use it all the time, now i just put `var slice = [].slice` at the top of every file
[06:24] SubStack: I'm not going to cry over the lost nanoseconds here
[06:24] chjj: hehe
[06:24] SubStack: hah
[06:24] chjj: i think slice.call() looks better than [].slice.call anyway
[06:24] SubStack: that is somebody at google's job to fix
[06:24] SubStack: not mine
[06:25] SubStack: v8 optimizations I mean
[06:25] chjj: yeah i figured
[06:25] Marak: SubStack: im writing asyncify
[06:25] Marak: SubStack: its almost done
[06:25] SubStack: Marak: rawk
[06:25] qhead has joined the channel
[06:25] SubStack: and who am I to deny those poor googlers their 20% time projects
[06:26] chjj: sometimes i wonder what obscure optimizations they make, i wonder if they optimized the hash table lookups for Array.prototype.slice.call
[06:26] SubStack: there's probably a whole team of them working on writing a [].slice.call() optimization as we speak
[06:26] chjj: haha

[06:35] Marak: i just feel icky doing a toString, but i guess dnode would have to do that anyway internally
[06:35] Marak: how else you gonna serialize a method

[06:35] Xano has joined the channel
[06:37] Marak: chapel: im making hook.io-asyncify

[06:37] SubStack: Marak: toString works well for that I think
[06:37] Marak: SubStack: yeah, ill just wrap it up in another layer on my end
[06:37] Marak: so the toString() is transparent
[06:38] SubStack: toString doesn't work for any method because you could have passwords and what-not in your server-side code
[06:38] SubStack: and the client doesn't need to care what code the server is running anyhow

[06:44] nonoders: I was wondering if you knew how to connect dnode
[06:44] nonoders: to "connect"
[06:45] nonoders: Not sure where it would fit in there, if I wanted to use dnode to serve the rpcs
[06:45] nonoders: yet use standard "connect" to serve static files 
[06:46] SubStack: pow
[06:47] nonoders: right in the kisser?
[06:47] SubStack: exactly
[06:47] AvianFlu has joined the channel
[06:47] nonoders: lolz
[06:47] SubStack: nonoders: just do dnode(whatevs).listen(app)
[06:47] SubStack: for some connect app `app`
[06:47] SubStack: it's like... crazy easy
[06:47] nonoders: SubStack:  i see the example has an express app not sure if that was the same as connect
[06:47] nonoders: I see.
[06:47] SubStack: yep it's the same
[06:47] nonoders: Right on!
[06:47] SubStack: it works for raw http servers even
[06:48] nonoders: what do you mean raw?
[06:48] SubStack: var app = http.createServer()
[06:48] SubStack: that kind
[06:48] nonoders: not speaking rpc protocol?
[06:48] nonoders: oh cool
[06:48] nonoders: that's the idea
[06:48] nonoders: how does it know which requests are for rpc
[06:48] SubStack: it uses socket.io for all of that
[06:48] nonoders: and which are for other resources?
[06:48] SubStack: and mounts /dnode.js
[06:48] SubStack: that is all
[06:49] nonoders: right, but I'm pretending to be the browser
[06:49] nonoders: sending requests to server
[06:49] nonoders: how does the server know i'm talking to dnode
[06:49] nonoders: and not making some other request?
[06:49] nonoders: for static resource for example
[06:49] nonoders: Traditionally, I've used a special endpoint
[06:50] nonoders: for rpc
[06:50] nonoders: like host:/dnodeEndpoint
[06:50] nonoders: so it knows all traffic there needs to go to dnode
[06:50] kohai: @roidrage: Node.js @nodecampeu hackage commences at the train station.
[06:51] SubStack: nonoders: you don't need to care about any of that
[06:51] SubStack: I only vaguely know how it works
[06:51] nonoders: I was just curious SubStack 
[06:51] nonoders: I've built my own before, and that's how I did it
[06:51] nonoders: so was just curious
[06:52] nonoders: didn't see any special endpoint
[06:52] SubStack: if you want you can pass the socket.io mountpoint options through the io param
[06:52] SubStack: dnode only mounts /dnode.js and uses socket.io for everything else
[06:53] nonoders: in my case, there are no standalone sockets, just https
[06:53] nonoders: *http
[06:53] nonoders: so it doesn't use socket.io does it?
[06:53] nonoders: browser -> server that's it
[06:53] SubStack: eh?

[07:45] Matt111: lol ;)  But on a serious note, any interesting startups by guests are always cool for presentations.  And open source stuff.
[07:46] brainproxy: yeah, i'm torn as to whether for our very first meeting I should have a presentation ready in case it turns into a dud; others have said leave the first meeting social, so folks can talk about expectations for the group
[07:47] Matt111: It depends on the group...  Some groups will be social people, others will need osme guidance and something to talk about
[07:48] Matt111: but as far as I'd be concerned, even if the 1st meeting is a total flop if you network with the people you will be able to find out what would make it successful, and re-invite them to a better organized 2nd meet
[07:49] brainproxy: well right now the meetup.com info for the 1st meeting says "let's talk about what we want.."
[07:49] brainproxy: so I think the expectations are fairly low as to content
[07:49] brainproxy: I guess I should be a good boy scout and prep a little talk anyway
[07:49] Matt111: lol

[07:50] Marak: SubStack: brainproxy done: https://github.com/Marak/hook.io-asyncify
[07:50] Marak: at least the prototype, its working
[07:51] brainproxy: should people that use braceless ifs and whiles be executed
[07:51] Marak: turn any block of sync code into an async block with a callback run on a new process

[07:53] brainproxy: but I'm getting excited
[07:53] Marak: brainproxy: hook.io core is < 120 lines atm
[07:53] Marak: and even that is bloated for what it does
[07:54] Marak: there are some underlying issues with the implementation to, but its functional ,which is good enough for now
[07:54] brainproxy: you going to reg hook.io?
[07:54] Marak: brainproxy: already did
[07:54] Marak: i had it awhile ago, just bought again
[07:54] brainproxy: cool
[07:54] Marak: brainproxy: i gave a talk at jsconf 2010 about hook.io
[07:54] brainproxy: man, wanted to come, couldn't make it this year
[07:55] Marak: i had the right idea, but my implementation was fucked
[07:55] brainproxy: maybe next
[07:55] Marak: brainproxy: this was 1.5 years ago
[07:55] brainproxy: oh, right, you said 2010
[07:55] Marak: been working on this idea in my head since before node.js even
[07:58] brainproxy: okay looked, i guess i need to also get my head around ee2 and dnode
[07:58] brainproxy: i have a notion of what they do just haven't thought about them deeply yet
[07:59] Marak: brainproxy: i would not even think about them lol
[07:59] Marak: brainproxy: thats what i try to do

[08:10] chapel: its only used for the browser
[08:10] Marak: chapel: do you know how to capture that event?
[08:10] chapel: it uses a socket for direct process connections
[08:10] Marak: as it should
[08:10] Marak: i thought socket.io did that, didnt know it was dnode
[08:10] chapel: which event, the error?
[08:10] Marak: i thought socket.io defaulted to tcp sockets when node to node

[10:38] Marak: i gotta release it tonight
[10:38] Marak: sorting out some jsdom things first
[10:40] xerox: ACTION clickes
[10:40] xerox: ooh
[10:42] xerox: so asyncify is the ""plugin""
[10:42] xerox: and test- is the client
[10:42] Marak: xerox: yeah, im about to refactor that though
[10:43] Marak: xerox: the new way it works is that the first hook you start up is a server
[10:43] kohai: @NodeJSAtSO: Node.js and piping a ConnectionListener http://bit.ly/jtKxhT (link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6315388/node-js-and-piping-a-connectionlistener?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed)
[10:43] Marak: and after that they all connect
[10:43] Marak: so instead of .connect()
[10:43] Marak: it will be .start()
[10:43] Marak: and .start() may listen or connect depending on what it should do
[10:43] Marak: .connect() and .listen() will be the explicit api
[10:43] xerox: gotcha
[10:43] Marak: so all my hooks will be .start() by default for the most part
[10:44] Marak: but if you are building an app, you'll want to bind to specific places
[10:44] Marak: but for dev, it will be magic
[10:44] Marak: the work flow is to npm install the hook and then run it
[10:44] Marak: boom
[10:44] Marak: thats it
[10:44] xerox: how is this different from json-rpc
[10:44] xerox: exactly
[10:44] Marak: xerox: json-rpc is a protocol for transmitting json data
[10:45] Marak: xerox: hook.io is a node.js i/o framework with a high level api
[10:45] Marak: exactly.
[10:45] xerox: hmm the implementation I saw queries the server for its methods, and created corresponding wrapping methods on the client
[10:46] Marak: you are looking at a very specific hook for doing a very specific purpose
[10:46] xerox: ah
[10:46] Marak: check out
[10:46] Marak: https://github.com/Marak/hook.io-logger/blob/master/logger
[10:46] xerox: what does a more general hook do, if not call some method on the server
[10:47] Marak: xerox: asyncify is for taking high cost sync code and shipping it to another process with a callback
[10:48] Marak: https://github.com/Marak/hook.io-twitter/blob/master/lib/twitter.js
[10:48] Marak: im still cleaning these all up
[10:48] xerox: ok
[10:48] Marak: i should write a docs on basic i / o
[10:49] xerox: do you also have the other part of code sketched down
[10:49] xerox: the one that uses the twitter hook defined there?
[10:50] Marak: xerox: its just a message, so you listen to the name
[10:50] Marak: xerox: there is no "other" part
[10:50] xerox: ah wow
[10:50] Marak: xerox: for testing i piped it to the logger
[10:50] Marak: which is just connecting the logger to it as a sibling
[10:50] Marak: its complicated internally i guess
[10:50] Marak: ill write some easy docs
[10:51] xerox: so you just require Hook and create handlers
[10:51] Marak: yep
[10:51] xerox: :o
[10:51] Marak: and they all magically network up
[10:51] xerox: love magic
[10:51] Marak: core is < 120 lines atm
[10:51] xerox: how long is each line xD
[10:51] Marak: its a little sloppy, but pretty concise 
[10:52] Marak: needs some cleanup
[10:52] xerox: j/k : )

[11:07] xerox: something to map, reduce, filter, first, last, etc...
[11:07] Marak: xerox: underscore

[11:13] xerox: Marak: just a thought, you could draw a picture, to understand why communications to clients go up and to servers go down
[11:13] twix: just want to send clients basic jquery commands like insertAfter from the server
[11:13] xerox: (I'm stupid, but I don't understand the wording)
[11:15] Marak: xerox: communication is bi-directional
[11:15] Marak: up and down is not meant to indicate that
[11:15] abaddon has left the channel
[11:15] Marak: up and down is meant to indicate the level of the i/o tree
[11:15] Marak: im trying to figure out how to make that not confusing
[11:15] Marak: i was calling it in and out before
[11:15] xerox: so your program at the top, and the "slaves" underneath, who can have more "slaves" and so on
[11:15] Marak: xerox: no top
[11:16] xerox: uh
[11:16] Marak: xerox: in most cases, you will have one
[11:16] Marak: xerox: but it could be circular
[11:16] Marak: you always need at least one server
[11:16] xerox: so a graph of programs communicating
[11:16] twix: do any of you guys know how to make firebug watch the incomming data from node.js ?
[11:16] Marak: yep
[11:16] kohai: @RobAshton: @theouteredge If it didn't have opinion, then it wouldn't fit the abstract - I actually wanted to do a node.js talk rather than MVC

[11:22] xerox: yeah
[11:23] xerox: would be alright for a tree, but there is no tree in general
[11:23] xerox: (also typo: withs)
[11:23] xerox: what does this mean, in particular the "re" of "rebroadcasted":   // "upstream" messages are always rebroadcasted to all siblings
[11:24] Shinuza: Marak: how are you "personal" projects related to nodejitsu
[11:24] Shinuza: I'm thinking hooks right know
[11:25] chunhao: does anybody here use nodeunit?

[11:25] Shinuza: chunhao: question?
[11:25] chunhao: I'm using nodeunit for testing, and I want to be able to use process.argv
[11:25] Marak: Shinuza: You'll have to be more specific 
[11:25] chunhao: but I can't pass any args to the nodeunit command
[11:25] Shinuza: xerox: the more I use it the more it slows down
[11:26] chunhao: if I use nodeunit test.js args, then it will try to find the args.js test
[11:26] xerox: I gave up on adium a year ago :/
[11:26] chunhao: is there any workaround for that? :/
[11:26] Shinuza: Marak: will the hooks project be part of nodejitsu's stack?
[11:27] Marak: Shinuza: i would hope so soon
[11:27] chunhao: or is there an alternative unit testing frameowkr for nodejs that supports process.argv?
[11:27] Marak: Shinuza: but we are a planned development route, we arent going to switch it up overnight
[11:27] Shinuza: chunhao: hum, can you try `nodeunit test.js - args`?
[11:27] Marak: chunhao: use vowsjs
[11:27] chunhao: Shinuza: nope, it tries to find "-.js"
[11:28] Shinuza: chunhao: use vowsjs > + 1
[11:28] chunhao: ok, thanks, I'll look into it

[11:30] Marak: davro: i believe its a DAG
[11:30] Marak: with default rules that are over-writeable per node
[11:30] Shinuza: Marak: balsamic mockups
[11:31] Marak: davro: I am not a computer scientist. 
[11:31] Marak: but its an i/o graph, for sure
[11:31] Marak: hook.io is gamechanging
[11:31] rchavik has joined the channel
[11:31] Shinuza: chunhao: I mean mock the args, use an object to test different configuration

[11:32] Shinuza: and keeps your tests self contained

[11:32] xerox: Marak: i... hmm
[11:32] xerox: Marak: on which OS ?
[11:33] Marak: davro: cool! if you come up with ANY ideas of a hook that are compelling ill build it
[11:33] Marak: davro: we built asyncify tonight, that takes any block of sync js code, ships it to a new process, and then returns the results asyncly
[11:33] xerox: (also tha

[11:49] cryptix1: hey nodesters
[11:51] butu5: Marak: I m new to nodejs.. (couple of month).. can u tell me a simple use case where I can use hook
[11:51] Marak: butu5: if you need to parse data from a real-time data source, like twitter or irc
[11:52] butu5: using twitter api or scraping twitter website data
[11:53] tahu has joined the channel
[11:53] Marak: butu5: both
[11:53] Marak: butu5: any i/o
[11:53] Marak: butu5: or scraping log files

[11:56] butu5: I looked at twitter hook from github... it's kind of polling the data right (or streaming)...

[11:59] xerox: Marak: cycles can be longer than 1
[11:59] Marak: butu5: not really, kinda
[11:59] xerox: so no, still not acyclic

[12:03] Marak: but you just do

[14:30] Marak: its just sugar syntax
[14:31] kbni: well, my idea is to have the same node instance that is serving web pages periodically do this

[15:26] zmbmartin: if that is the case I can just use connect-form and ditch bodyParser right?

[17:16] alessio_alex: hello guys
[17:16] alessio_alex: I have a theoretical question
[17:16] thalll has joined the channel
[17:17] alessio_alex: what's better in an MVC app: loading all the modules, controllers and helpers when the app starts OR loading each module, controller etc when needed (with each page render) ?
[17:17] boogyman: latter
[17:17] MooGoo: as long as you only need to load them once
[17:18] Marak: alessio_alex: probably better in theory to keep it simple and have the least amount of moving pieces, start the app, its started, thats it
[17:18] alessio_alex: I guess it would be better to load them all just once, but that would result in the app needing at least X RAM all the time no?
[17:19] Xano has joined the channel
[17:19] MooGoo: eh
[17:19] MooGoo: it probably makes no difference
[17:19] Marak: alessio_alex: node apps dont take up too much memory for that reason
[17:19] masylum: require caches
[17:19] Marak: alessio_alex: its gonna be like 8 mbs
[17:19] MooGoo: but require works this way automaticly
[17:19] MooGoo: just call require whenever you need to
[17:19] Marak: yeah
[17:19] MooGoo: it caches stuff
[17:20] alessio_alex: hmmmm
[17:20] kris_will has joined the channel
[17:20] alessio_alex: MooGoo I'm not refearring to that 
[17:20] alessio_alex: As a practical example
[17:20] alessio_alex: Situation A: The server loads all files at the start.
[17:20] tauren has joined the channel
[17:20] alessio_alex: When the user sees 10 pages, it won't load anything since it already has the modules, controllers etc
[17:21] alessio_alex: Situation B: the app doesn't load anything when it starts, but just when the rendering happens.
[17:21] Multiply has joined the channel
[17:21] masylum: loading a module is not THAT expensive
[17:21] MooGoo: best advice, dont worry about it, code your app in the most natural way
[17:21] masylum: it doesnt really matter
[17:21] alessio_alex: oh
[17:21] masylum: since it will happen only once
[17:21] alessio_alex: oh
[17:21] MooGoo: to me it seems more complex to preload everything
[17:21] alessio_alex: okey then
[17:21] alessio_alex: btw
[17:22] alessio_alex: thanks guys
[17:22] alessio_alex: and thanks Marak for the beautiful components and the enthusiasm of coding in node

[18:40] V1: No Derk  it does not

[18:56] _beau: still trying to track it down
[18:56] MooGoo: I've never seen that message
[18:56] MooGoo: and I'm sure I've attached more than 11 listeners at times
[18:56] _beau: my listeners arent getting removed is what i think it is
[18:56] Derk: when i start mongo.exe it show a window, then closes it after <1 sec. what goes wrong?
[18:56] MooGoo: so
[18:56] MooGoo: seems like a strange message
[18:56] AvianFlu: _beau: yes, pretty much
[18:56] MooGoo: is that node itself or some module

[18:57] AvianFlu: moogoo: it's something you see when you make a mistake
[18:57] MooGoo: what kind of mistake exactly
[18:57] AvianFlu: if you add a listener, but don't remove it
[18:57] AvianFlu: and then add another
[18:58] AvianFlu: you'll potentially end up with way too many listeners firing at a time
[18:58] MooGoo: same event and function
[18:58] AvianFlu: which can cause that message
[18:58] MooGoo: ?
[18:58] AvianFlu: yes
[18:58] alloc: AvianFlu: I think it's from socket.io library
[18:58] AvianFlu: alloc: likely a known error then
[18:58] MooGoo: hmm...
[18:59] alloc: AvianFlu: setSocketIO and xpress, but rather something to do with xhr-pooling?
[18:59] alloc: seems also npm had issue with this
[18:59] AvianFlu: yeah, check the githubs

[21:28] mahalie: sorry, i am new to all this…so i need to do some homework. tx
[21:28] tmpvar: JoseCabo, which version of ubuntu and node are you using?
[21:28] dall: in that directory (/home/dall/node) I see "node" application
[21:28] Cybrix: Ok, I'll go with my question then. I would like to know what event I must bind to detect when a client disconnect in a net.createServer ?
[21:28] dall: do i have to use this or do i have to find "node" in other directories ?
[21:29] vyvea: Node.js team don't have plan to add WebSocket support in Core?

[21:32] tmpvar: so args[index].toObject() ?
[21:32] dall: mt3ck_, yes i know i can save my program in other directories....i mean.....i have done ./configure make and make install on /home/dall/node    the question is...do i have to use the "node" on that directory (/home/dall/node/node) or do i have to find the correct application to another directory?
[21:32] JoseCabo: yes

[22:40] broofa: what's the recommended way of specifying 'mode' values in the fs api?  I'm used to providing octal values on the command line, but ES5 has deprecated the "0XXX" notation for octal literals. 
[22:40] broofa: So I'm currently doing "parseInt('755', 8)", but that's a bit clunky.

[22:41] rpj8: SubStack: I'm just gonna leave this here... http://jsfiddle.net/9Qd8B/
[22:42] SubStack: broofa: just use octal
[22:42] SubStack: it still works fine
[22:42] SubStack: and will continue to do so for years to come

[22:44] broofa: SubStack sorry, but I've got jshint wired to run on save in vim, which is really convenient the other 98% of the time.
[22:44] SubStack: rpj8: throwing is pesky, it's usually much better to send the error as the first parameter to the callback
[22:45] SubStack: rpj8: so if (err) callback(err) else callback(null, 'waiting for partner')
[22:45] rpj8: SubStack: I see. I'm a newbie if you couldn't tell :P so that helps me
[22:46] SubStack: seems fine otherwise

[22:49] mahalie has joined the channel
[22:49] SubStack: I should write jsmint to analyze your code
[22:49] broofa: SubStack: it's not crockford that's the boss, but the pre-commit hooks that we've got guarding the Facebook codebase that are the ones being bossy.  All JS gets lint'ed on commit.
[22:49] SubStack: except instead of that it just checks for syntax errors and bitches if you don't have any tests

[23:29] Dinosaurus: how can i find the size of a variable in bytes?
[23:29] mikegerwitz: JCP|2: Just use REPL. Type `node`, require() something then take a look at require.cache
[23:30] JCP|2: I found something on Stack Overflow: delete require.cache['./dynamic.js']; but does that work if I have included the file using include(filename) ?
[23:30] DTrejo: not really possible Dinosaurus, unless a string or something. or im misunderstanding ur question
[23:30] MooGoo: Dinosaurus ask v8
[23:30] mikegerwitz: JCP|2: Removing it from require.cache should cause it to reload. Note that it uses absolute paths (at least in my version)
[23:30] Dinosaurus: how do i ask v8
[23:30] mikegerwitz: JCP|2: even if you require relative
[23:30] MooGoo: no clue
[23:30] MooGoo: but would javascript know the size in bytes of an object or function
[23:30] Dinosaurus: why not?
[23:31] MooGoo: cause it depends on how the implementation stores it
[23:31] dgathright has joined the channel
[23:31] MooGoo: an object could take up more or less room in spider monkey than in v8
[23:31] MooGoo: who knows
[23:31] Aria has joined the channel
[23:32] Dinosaurus: why shouldn't you be ale to get the size of it O-o
[23:32] MooGoo: what use would itbe
[23:32] MooGoo: in a GC'd language
[23:32] Dinosaurus: to determine the length of a tcp packet
[23:32] Dinosaurus: data 
[23:32] mikegerwitz: Dinosaurus: Perhaps a profiling tool can, but I'm not familiar with v8's API.
[23:32] MooGoo: are you asking just about strings
[23:32] MooGoo: or buffers
[23:32] Dinosaurus: no
[23:32] Dinosaurus: a value from pcap
[23:32] MooGoo: eh?
[23:32] rpj8: SubStack: the alert that should, in my mind, say 'Test' (nor the other alert) are showing
[23:33] tcurdt has joined the channel
[23:33] mikegerwitz: Dinosaurus: what is typeof the var?
[23:33] Dinosaurus: object
[23:33] __sorin__ has joined the channel
[23:34] mikegerwitz: Dinosaurus: then you cannot from JS unless a profiling tool can expose that to you.
[23:34] MooGoo: is it a Buffer?
[23:34] mahalie has joined the channel
[23:34] mikegerwitz: ^ unless that
[23:34] MooGoo: var instanceof Buffer
[23:35] JCP|2: mikegerwitz: delete( require.cache[ require.resolve( './dynamic.js' ) ] ); actually did it!
[23:35] JCP|2: thank you!
[23:35] sirdancealot has joined the channel
[23:35] Dinosaurus: how do i do that
[23:35] MooGoo: does that force node to reload a module source from disk?
[23:35] mikegerwitz: JCP|2: np. note that delete is also an operator, not a function. The parenthesis there are fine, but deceptive
[23:36] JCP|2: allright I'll remove em
[23:36] mikegerwitz: MooGoo: It should, yes. But it won't magically replace objects in memory
[23:36] JCP|2: Thanks again you rock!
[23:36] MooGoo: clearly
[23:36] MooGoo: still handy
[23:36] sechrist has joined the channel
[23:38] mikegerwitz: JCP|2: The v8 guys also recommend against using delete unless it's necessary, since it slows down property lookups on the object. Setting it to undefined may be sufficient.
[23:38] MrNibbles: mikegerwitz: interesting
[23:39] tuhoojabotti: :O
[23:39] tuhoojabotti: But doesn't it fill up memory?
[23:39] JCP|2: mikegerwitz: Does that mean that using: var dynLibrary = require("dynamic.js"); and inside my watchFile's callback I should just do: dynLibrary = undefined?
[23:40] tuhoojabotti: or is the garbage collector so smart?
[23:40] JCP|2: and reaload it back
[23:40] mikegerwitz: tuhoojabotti: in JCP|2's case it won't matter since the property is being re-used. I suppose so, yes, though it'd be minimal.
[23:40] MrNibbles: im looking forward to the method jit analysis tools
[23:40] carpeliam has joined the channel
[23:40] mikegerwitz: tuhoojabotti: GC can't clear it, no.
[23:40] tuhoojabotti: yeah
[23:40] mikegerwitz: JCP|2: no - require.cache[ require.resolve( './dynamic.js' ) ] = undefined
[23:41] rpj8: SubStack: infact, console log doesn't say anything about a client connecting in any way.
[23:41] tuhoojabotti: so it's better to delete my cache entries :P
[23:41] JCP|2: mikegerwitz: Oh unstead to use delete. Got it
[23:41] mikegerwitz: tuhoojabotti: depends. seeing it to undefined will remove the reference to whatever was there previously, which will allow it to be GC'd if nothing else references it. So the amount of memory is equivalent to the value of undefined (however v8 represents that)
[23:42] mikegerwitz: tuhoojabotti: (sorry if that's what you were asking before. I thought you were talking about GC'ing the property itself, which would then contain undefined)
[23:43] tuhoojabotti: I didn't get it
[23:43] tuhoojabotti: my dad is installing a new laptop, and he's drunk
[23:43] matjas has joined the channel
[23:44] JCP|2: Another quick question: Should I use this.foo = require("file.js"); with file.js: this.foo = "bar"; or I could use global.foo = "bar"; in my .js file and do a normal require("file.js") in my main? 
[23:44] tuhoojabotti: He chose IE!
[23:44] JCP|2: maybe it's not clear what I'm saying
[23:44] mikegerwitz: tuhoojabotti: he must be very drunk, then!
[23:45] mikegerwitz: JCP|2: what are you trying to accomplish?
[23:45] mikegerwitz: JCP|2: globals are never a good idea
[23:45] mynyml has joined the channel
[23:46] JCP|2: I would like to define my program's logic in an object and reload it when the file has changed
[23:46] JCP|2: I must say I was using the global
[23:46] JCP|2: should I rely on this. instead?
[23:47] JCP|2: the dynamic.js is just a big object containing my program's configuration
[23:47] mikegerwitz: I'd just add the value to exports (I think the docs said this === exports, but I'm not certain), then after you require() it, do whatever you need to with that new value
[23:47] JCP|2: this is the object I'm trying to overwrite when dynamic.js is modified
[23:48] iammerrick has joined the channel
[23:49] JCP|2: Allright!
[23:51] carpeliam: looking to choose a web socket library to use in my node project, and from what research i've done so far, socket.io is more forward-compatible, but faye has more features. does that sound about right?
[23:52] addisonj_: carpeliam, they are different, faye is a pub sub library, socket.io is just for sockets
[23:52] addisonj_: juggernaught is a pub sub library built on socket.io
[23:52] addisonj_: pub sub can be overkill for a lot of apps
[23:53] SubStack: "pubsub" is like event emitters, but less useful
[23:53] SubStack: transport libraries shouldn't be rolling their own event abstractions
[23:54] carpeliam: my app is a 2 player game, so i want to make sure that only the people playing or watching a particular game will get the messages for that game
[23:54] addisonj_: you can roll your own pretty easily with socket.io, or juggernaught would do that pretty easily
[23:55] SubStack: carpeliam: check out dnode
[23:55] SubStack: ACTION wrote it
[23:55] addisonj_: or dnode ;)
[23:56] carpeliam: addisonj_: from what i've read, juggernaut is its own node app- do i set up a separate juggernaut server that talks to my node server, or does juggernaut play well in other apps?
[23:56] addisonj_: trust substack, he is quite smart
[23:56] carpeliam: SubStack: i'll take a look :)
[23:57] SubStack: in fact: http://substack.net/posts/9bac3e
[23:57] SubStack: step-by-step guide on how to roll your own pubsub with dnode
[23:59] OneBraveHog: yeah I saw your github substack - you've created a lot of things !
