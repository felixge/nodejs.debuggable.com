[01:06] alibapcyk: Quick question if anyone can help
[01:06] alibapcyk: when doing an http.request, you get a res.on('data')

[01:08] alibapcyk: ah I see
[01:08] navaru: res.on('data') <-- shouldn't be request
[01:09] alibapcyk: so it's .on('end') ?

[01:12] deedubs has joined the channel
[01:13] julioj: that pattern can be used on other things too, like fs.createReadStream and process.stdin.
[01:15] alibapcyk: hm, on end never appears to get called
[01:18] cha0s: alibapcyk, I wonder if that has to do with a persistent connection (just guessing)
[01:19] cha0s: Is there an .on('close' ?

[01:21] alibapcyk: Doesn't look like there is an .on('close')
[01:21] alibapcyk: from the docs
[01:21] cha0s: I was backwards, end is the request end, close is the connection close =)
[01:21] cha0s: Is there any way your remote HTTP response is never terminating?
[01:21] jonaslund_ has joined the channel
[01:21] alibapcyk: I don't think so
[01:21] cha0s: There is http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.5.6/api/http.html#event_close_ but it's not the right event for your case
[01:21] alibapcyk: it's a basic google search
[01:21] jvdev has joined the channel
[01:21] alibapcyk: I get response 200
[01:22] cha0s: Well, that's interesting. I remember learning about using 'transfer-encoding: chunked' to allow dynamic body lengths
[01:22] cha0s: Is google setting that header? Might make sense with all their new G+ stuff
[01:23] alibapcyk: Um, yes I guess so
[01:23] cha0s: I'm not sure what the 'right' way is to handle that. I'd guess you could parse the response as you get it, and just close it yourself when you get what you need?
[01:23] jobin88 has joined the channel
[01:24] alibapcyk: Maybe, seems a bit hacky though, I'd rather figure out what's actually preventing on end from getting called
[01:24] julioj has joined the channel
[01:24] cha0s: alibapcyk, if Google's setting chunked that means the connection isn't actually ending... that is, at any time it can send more down the pipe
[01:25] alibapcyk: cha0s, sure, but the result is complete, so
[01:25] enhydra has joined the channel
[01:26] cha0s: alibapcyk, like I said, my best guess is it has to do with the new G+ stuff. When I load google.com now, it sits there and a couple seconds later you can see it transfer a small amount more data for the bar on top. My guess would be that.

[01:38] workit: @ShonM it still has issues. i changed the server host to 127.0.0.1 and it tried to work, but wen i accessed it localhost:31411 it crashed
[01:38] ShonM: workit: OS issue?
[01:38] workit: with a TypeError: Object #<IncomingMessage> has no method 'setBodyEncoding'

[01:39] workit: i hope not. Win764, using Cygwin. i;ve been able to run the node chat though
[01:39] bnoordhuis: cha0s: so for node that means all supported platforms except windows
[01:39] cha0s: bnoordhuis, Thanks!
[01:39] ShonM: workit: imo install ubuntu, try it there.
[01:39] bnoordhuis: workit: are you mixing express and plain node?
[01:40] bnoordhuis: setBodyEncoding is not a method in the core node api
[01:40] cha0s: I basically really like the idea of binary addons in a game engine and I'm curious how node did it. Kind of sucky that it doesn't work on Windows, *but* if I got that route, I'll probably learn enough to get it working in node, too =)
[01:40] workit: as we speak,. vmware is doing that ^^
[01:40] workit: i think it is plain
[01:40] bnoordhuis: cha0s: if you really want you can link in your add-ons statically
[01:41] bnoordhuis: workit: in that case you probably want setEncoding (sans Body)
[01:41] cha0s: bnoordhuis, I don't like that though. The whole point of using V8 in general is so things can be nice and dynamic
[01:41] workit: let me try. thanks
[01:41] cha0s: but, noted. =)
[01:42] JaKWaC has joined the channel
[01:43] cha0s: I haven't touched it in a looong time but the freebasic source code has a cross-platform method for dynamic library loading. I'm wondering how much I can cannibalize.

[01:43] JaKWaC has joined the channel
[01:43] workit: you suggest i make it, request.setBodyEncoding('sans Body');
[01:44] bnoordhuis: workit: read what i said again
[01:44] bnoordhuis: and for the french language-challenged, 'sans' in this context means 'without'
[01:45] cha0s: workit, he means setEncoding, not setBodyEncoding
[01:45] JakeyChan has joined the channel
[01:45] workit: hehe well what i did was change the setBodyEncoding to setEncoding and the new error i got was TypeError: Object #<ServerResponse> has no method 'sendHeader'
[01:46] workit: forgive my slowness bnoordhuis
[01:46] cha0s: Well, it doesn't make sense to send a header to a response...
[01:46] workit: bnoorduis: i think it is a DNS issue though. wat is yo take?
[01:47] bnoordhuis: workit: my take is that you misspelled 'setHeader'

[09:23] mjr_: monokrome: Riak is not a relational database, so an ORM would be an odd fit.
[09:23] TheJH: elliottcable, you can, but it's a lot of pain if it has dependencies
[09:23] monokrome: mjr_: Riak represents relations via link walking
[09:24] mjr_: Yeah, kinda.
[09:24] mjr_: But it's more like a secondary index than an actual relation
[09:24] mjr_: You can't do "joins"
[09:24] monokrome: meh
[09:24] monokrome: It might not be a constraint, but it's a relation.
[09:25] mjr_: But what's to map? You can store your actual objects in there, just JSON.stringify them, boom.
[09:25] monokrome: Either way, there's got to be someone out there implementing an interface to make that easier.

[09:25] elliottcable: in the middle of some intense debugging, and I don’t want to lose my train of thought
[09:26] mjr_: Riak is hard to use at the moment.  It's getting better with 1.0, but it still lags behind Mongo in terms of usability.
[09:26] mjr_: That said, I'm a fan of Riak, and I think it's worth suffering through the initial learning curve.
[09:26] elliottcable: how do I ensure I have the latest npm?
[09:26] monokrome: Too bad mongo sucks at everything else
[09:26] TheJH: elliottcable, what package is it? I could just install it here, make a tarball and give you the tarball, I think
[09:26] TheJH: elliottcable, depends on your current npm version?

[09:28] hermanjunge: elliotcable
[09:28] elliottcable: sure, but I have no desire to litter stuff all over my system.
[09:28] hermanjunge: what version of node.js are you using?
[09:28] TheJH: elliottcable, git clone, configure, make, make install
[09:28] DrMcKay: I mean, use brew, but not for node
[09:28] hermanjunge: no
[09:28] hermanjunge: git clone.... etc etc
[09:28] hermanjunge: better
[09:28] elliottcable: DrMcKay › again, I don’t want to leave any stuff *outside* of homebrew’s control. Makes it more difficult to manage/remove.
[09:28] TheJH: ah, I forgot "checkout"

[09:29] elliottcable: yeah, that’s exactly the dist it’s trying to use
[09:29] elliottcable: let me wipe my entire brew and start over.
[09:29] elliottcable: Maybe something’s messing with it.
[09:30] TheJH: !remember head If you're using the git HEAD version of something, expect stuff to break. Period. Use a version the author declared as "stable" or at least one he released as a seperate version.
[09:30] jhbot: saved definition of 'head'
[09:30] hermanjunge: yep
[09:30] hermanjunge: the HEAD version is unstable
[09:30] elliottcable: TheJH › For every single one of my hundreds of projets, the HEAD *is* the declared-stable.
[09:30] hermanjunge: the last week at last

[09:35] hermanjunge: I declare myself totally n00b. Don't bite me :D
[09:35] elliottcable: not quite
[09:35] elliottcable: I know a ‘couple of things’ about working on *my* repositories
[09:36] elliottcable: but they’re by no means standard; I have zero knowledge of the requirements or tactics required on a project like Node.js or NPM.
[09:36] elliottcable: my code is all public because I want people to be able to learn from it and use it freely; not because I accept much in the way of contributions.
[09:37] hermanjunge: what is your repo?
[09:37] elliottcable: so, I was expressing a reasoning for my surprise at the fact that HEAD was unstable; not a judgement of the Node.js team for taking the old-school way of “releasing” code outside of the repository, and using the repository solely for unstable development ^‿^
[09:37] hermanjunge: cool
[09:37] elliottcable: it worked!
[09:37] hermanjunge: with 4.12?
[09:37] elliottcable: for some odd reason, it took several minutes to run before spitting anything out, but it worked eventually
[09:37] elliottcable: so, happyiottcable.
[09:38] elliottcable: thanks for calling out my idiocy with --HEAD, y’all.
[09:38] TheJH: elliottcable, npm often works that way, you have to stare at a blank screen until it has nearly finished its work

[09:45] DrMcKay: sure you can
[09:45] megalomix: k but i remember there was problem with lass privileges using Express.js
[09:46] megalomix: (to listen 80 port)
[09:47] DrMcKay: only root can listen on port 80
[09:47] DrMcKay: and that's not node's fault, that's how Unices are designed
[09:48] megalomix: hmm ok

[09:49] konobi: no.de, you can can bind to port 80 as a normal user

[10:12] DrMcKay: btw, if anyone was looking for an awesome vim javascript plugin, here it is: https://github.com/pangloss/vim-javascript
[10:13] ron_frown: anyone recommend any connection/session management plugins
[10:13] DrMcKay: ron_frown: plugins for what?
[10:13] ron_frown: I've got raw websockets and socket.io connections that I'd like to kinda lump together and enable something like socket.io's chatrooms functionality
[10:14] ron_frown: so I'd like to be able ot have groups of people lumped together
[10:14] ron_frown: almost like a hybrid of pubsub
[10:14] DrMcKay: ron_frown: why not use socket.io, then?
[10:14] ron_frown: apparently it doesnt talk the draft the clients do so I have to use websocket-server
[10:15] DrMcKay: ron_frown: (works with Chrome 15)

[10:21] megalomix: but
[10:21] megalomix: how to always get the latest version ?
[10:21] DrMcKay: megalomix: "redis": "*"
[10:21] megalomix: because if i use it i always will have 0.6.7 version
[10:21] megalomix: DrMcKay, Perfect! it gets the lastest?
[10:22] DrMcKay: megalomix: yup
[10:22] megalomix: goo
[10:22] megalomix: d
[10:23] megalomix: now i'm thinking maybe is not safe to do that, because if i test with a version does not mean that it will work forever....hmmm
[10:23] megalomix: better to specify the version :)
[10:24] megalomix: lasti thing...how can i see the versions of a package?
[10:24] TheJH: megalomix, "npm ls"?
[10:24] megalomix: i mean...at the moment express.js is 3.0.0alpha1 so i don't thing is already good to use
[10:24] megalomix: npm express ls
[10:25] megalomix: ?
[10:25] TheJH: megalomix, no, just "npm ls"
[10:25] megalomix: i would get the last stable version
[10:25] jbpros has joined the channel
[10:26] TheJH: megalomix, 2.4.6 is the latest express version on npm
[10:26] megalomix: how did you see it
[10:26] megalomix: ?
[10:26] TheJH: err, wait. what is express.js?
[10:26] megalomix: yes
[10:26] megalomix: express.js
[10:27] megalomix: web framework
[10:27] TheJH: megalomix, is that even on npm?
[10:28] megalomix: sure
[10:28] megalomix: i'm searching at: http://search.npmjs.org/
[10:28] megalomix: but i don't find that
[10:28] augustl: it's just called "express"
[10:28] augustl: packages are discouraged from having the .js suffix in npm
[10:28] megalomix: augustl, yes
[10:29] megalomix: i searched "express"
[10:29] megalomix: but there is not
[10:29] megalomix: https://github.com/visionmedia/express <--- this package i mean
[10:29] TheJH: megalomix, go to http://search.npmjs.org/#/express directly
[10:30] megalomix: strange...the search is not working goo
[10:30] megalomix: good

[10:32] TheJH: megalomix, ah, yes - it's up to the package owner whether he published beta stuff on npm, most don't
[10:33] megalomix: ah ok
[10:33] megalomix: perfect
[10:33] megalomix: btw we have to tell to isaacs that the search is not working good
[10:36] augustl: what's wrong with the search?
[10:39] TheJH: augustl, it orders alphabetically. so all the express-addon-stuff that comes before express in the alphabet shows up on the search results page, and express isn't shown because of the result count limit
[10:40] augustl: ah

[11:31] guidocalvano: is it possible to get a pointer value out of an object?

[12:17] DrMcKay: Acolyte: huh?
[12:17] TheJH: Acolyte, huh? What would a "website bootloader" do?
[12:17] Acolyte: I suppose its the way I see it, but here it is
[12:18] Acolyte: You treat the server as raw data "server", i.e. mongodb, rest or odata service and also as static file server
[12:19] Acolyte: composition of pages happen through client side templates that are pulled statically from the server
[12:19] Acolyte: which are populated by data
[12:19] cooter has joined the channel
[12:19] mAritz: Acolyte: sure, a lot of pages do that. especially single page apps.
[12:20] Acolyte: so, "bootloader", in a sense, would be a very small piece of code that gives certain info so that everything else can be loaded after if necessary
[12:21] Acolyte: mAritz: can you give me an example?
[12:21] mAritz: backbone.js is for example used a lot for doing mvc in the browser and there are numerous templating solutions (jquery itself even has one)

[13:21] yogesh: how many concurrent user can a single node server instance can handle 
[13:22] japj: shripad: the memory limit is currently still in place in v8, but there is an experimental new garbage collector being developed for v8 that should solve that

[15:04] alibapcyk: Hey - Have a quick question if anyone is willing to help, not quite sure how to approach this
[15:04] alibapcyk: I have a collection of 8 urls that I want to visit, scrape the text from and combine into a single string 
[15:05] alibapcyk: so I need some way of using http.get on my server, to visit each in turn, with a lowish timeout, so if the site doesn't respond I just move on
[15:05] alibapcyk: and combine all at the end,
[15:05] alibapcyk: what's the best way of managing that sort of thing?
[15:07] alibapcyk: I guess just http.get in a loop and then call out to some management function on each onend? is there a cleaner way?

[15:53] Lingerance: Just ask the question guy.

[15:55] Lingerance: Fabryz: I don't see where you're using var in that gist.
[15:55] Fabryz: Lingerance not in the gist, was just thinking about it
[15:56] brokenjames has joined the channel
[15:56] Fabryz: I guess the that = this scope trick is "ok"?
[15:56] Fabryz: in the view of code conventions
[15:58] Lingerance: You can .bind(), .call() and .apply() to force this to be that value you want.  But normally it's just easier to do var self = this;
[15:58] Fabryz: ok
[15:59] ron_frown has joined the channel
[15:59] nickf: so, any ideas on how to pass in some markdown to be parsed by jade?

[16:00] simenbrekken: I've got an iPhone app API backend running and I'd like to collect and visualize some statistics, any recommendations?

[16:02] Lingerance: Not sure
[16:02] fread2281: how would i get node.js working on a powerpc?
[16:02] Lingerance: Port v8 to it.

[16:09] marcello3d: but that won't start it if the server restarts, right?
[16:09] MooGoo: yea...scripts running from init.d are not gaurenteed to stay running
[16:09] MooGoo: you want node to start before any user logins?

[17:37] borior: hi all, I'm new to this lark. If i want to read binary data from a URL, I end up receiving it in chunks -- a stream of Buffers. If I want to assemble these into one big buffer, what's the best way to do so?

[17:41] AvianFlu: have an empty string 'total' and have each time be `total += data.toString()`
[17:42] rbriggin has joined the channel
[17:42] borior: AvianFlu: yeah, so that would work if it weren't binary data...
[17:42] Morkel has joined the channel
[17:42] borior: I'm guessing i just accumulate the buffers in a list
[17:42] AvianFlu: oh, I misread you
[17:42] AvianFlu: there's buffer concat stuff
[17:42] borior: and then do bufList.reduce(function (x) { return x.length })
[17:42] AvianFlu: the Buffer prototype has some array-esque stuff that would probably help you
[17:43] borior: AvianFlu: I can concat buffers?
[17:43] borior: that doesn't look to be documented...
[17:43] AvianFlu: give me a second
[17:43] borior: hmm, no, I can't concat buffers
[17:43] borior: it's alright, I think I've worked it out anyay
[17:43] Swizec has joined the channel
[17:44] AvianFlu: you get .copy and .slice

[17:54] devaholic: what is your plan for return function
[17:54] devaholic: ...
[17:54] harthur has joined the channel
[17:55] alibapcyk: How do you mean? The reason that's there is to break the url being bound to the last one in the loop, so I can get at the correct url
[17:55] alibapcyk: but if I just return that function
[17:55] alibapcyk: it's not actually getting executed when I call async.parallel
[17:55] alibapcyk: I haven't added it yet, but I will soon do http.get requests and ideally have them execute in parallel
[17:56] devaholic: result = examineUrl(currentUrl)(); ??
[17:56] alibapcyk: Doesn't work, all the urls end up being the same
[17:57] guidocalvano has joined the channel
[17:57] stagas: alibapcyk: in 21 you need: var result = ...
[17:57] Swizec has joined the channel
[17:57] stagas: alibapcyk: to make 'result' be local in that closure, otherwise you're just overwriting the same variable
[17:58] stagas: alibapcyk: goes to the top scope by default
[17:58] alibapcyk: stagas - Thanks, but I still don't think that solves the problem
[17:59] alibapcyk: Just checked, it doesn't
[17:59] alibapcyk: Although that was a bug ;)
[18:00] stagas: alibapcyk: ok also in examineUrl you return a function, not the url
[18:01] AAA_awright: Yeah always use "var" even inside for loops
[18:01] Swizec has joined the channel
[18:01] alibapcyk: stagas, yeah, because if I just return the url, it ends up just binding to the last one from the loop
[18:01] AAA_awright: Where's the "async" object come from?
[18:02] alibapcyk: AAA_awright: var async = require('async') - it's a node module
[18:02] alibapcyk: https://github.com/caolan/async#parallel
[18:04] AAA_awright: I would think currentUrl is a new reference each time since it's a local scope
[18:04] AAA_awright: But that's probably not good enough
[18:04] stagas: alibapcyk: ok, what you're doing is weird. the anon function you create in 20, doesn't keep the currentUrl in closure since it executes in another context below
[18:05] alibapcyk: stagas: Okay, I don't know how to fix :(
[18:05] AAA_awright: alibapcyk: http://pastebin.com/rSqGCfgk
[18:06] AAA_awright: That *should* work
[18:06] alibapcyk: AAA_awright - Sweet thanks, I'll try it out
[18:06] AAA_awright: If there's a better way to do it I'm unaware of how
[18:07] AAA_awright: It's very non-intuitive, you would think a locally scoped var in Javascript would do the same thing
[18:07] metellus has joined the channel
[18:08] Brandon_R has joined the channel
[18:09] AAA_awright: alibapcyk: Also, try using "let" instead of "var", maybe that's what that is for
[18:09] alibapcyk: AAA_awright - Your example worked! Thank you! But jesus I'm struggling to follow it ;P
[18:09] alibapcyk: You're some sort of magic man 
[18:10] AAA_awright: It's because it's using the variable inside a function, and the reference in the old function doesn't change when a new function is called
[18:10] AAA_awright: s/variable/argument/
[18:10] AAA_awright: If that makes any sense
[18:11] alibapcyk: AAA_awright - Yeah I follow why it was failing before, your solution blows my mind though
[18:11] AAA_awright: You would expect the same thing to happen when you use var i=...; inside a loop, because it's declaring a new "i" each time that shouldn't override the old variable "i" but I guess not (likewise, I would expect it to happen if I used var i=...; outside the for loop, but redefined the value inside it)

[18:15] stagas: alibapcyk: here's a simple solution http://pastebin.com/kRTc0hNn
[18:15] stagas: alibapcyk: you shouldn't use async modules if you don't understand javascript well
[18:15] AAA_awright: I don't think that's the same thing, isn't phantomjs literally a web browser so you can take screenshots?
[18:16] stagas: leads to many problems

[18:48] AvianFlu: unresolved, but largely in key
[18:50] augustl: how safe is it to rely on the contents of the message property of the exception you get when you require a none-existing file?
[18:50] augustl: rely on it to detect that the error we got was that a module was missing, that is
[18:50] AvianFlu: augustl: error.message is pretty consistent in that case
[18:50] augustl: I hope so :)
[18:51] AvianFlu: I check for it here https://github.com/nodejitsu/require-analyzer/blob/master/bin/find-dependencies#L33 and use it for the node-detective fallback

[19:01] TheJH: AvianFlu, no, I have a cool programming language to create :/
[19:01] AvianFlu: on what platform
[19:01] TheJH: AvianFlu, one that compiles to JS
[19:01] AvianFlu: nice
[19:01] AvianFlu: make it better than coffeescript and I'll give you a dollar
[19:02] AvianFlu: XD
[19:02] TheJH: AvianFlu, this already works: https://github.com/thejh/moronspeak/blob/master/example/simple.moron
[19:02] augustl: give me a programming language with an asynchronous stdlib and line based async instead of callback based async!
[19:02] TheJH: AvianFlu, but it's in a very early stage, no conditionals or loops or anything like that yet
[19:02] AvianFlu: augustl, you should keep in mind that JS is a functional programming language... it really helped me to get down with callbacks
[19:02] Lingerance: line-based async?
[19:03] TheJH: augustl, line based async? you mean, non-indented callbacks? coco has those
[19:03] Lingerance: How would that look?
[19:03] AvianFlu: it's all math

[19:03] AvianFlu: line-based async, I don't know
[19:03] topaxi_ has joined the channel
[19:03] AvianFlu: I think he means the futures / promises approach
[19:03] AvianFlu: where it looks like it's returning
[19:03] DrMcKay: like in adisp: a = yield asyncFunction()
[19:03] AvianFlu: and you still get to write sync code
[19:03] DrMcKay: (adisp is for python tornado)
[19:04] augustl: http://pastie.org/2590424
[19:04] augustl: db.getStuff would not block the process
[19:04] augustl: but  that particular execution flow would still not continue to the next line until getStuff has finished
[19:04] TheJH: augustl, coco has something like that
[19:04] augustl: what's coco?
[19:05] augustl: AvianFlu: not futures/promises.
[19:05] AvianFlu: augustl, my bad, I misunderstood
[19:05] TheJH: augustl, https://github.com/satyr/coco/wiki/additions#wiki-backcall
[19:05] augustl: apology accepted :)
[19:06] Lingerance: That looks like an actual future.
[19:06] TheJH: augustl, coco is a coffeescript fork
[19:06] AvianFlu: you can make a function that does that in js, though... you'd just still have to have async inside it XD
[19:06] Lingerance: As in a variable that doesn't have a value until the async is done.

[22:11] DrMcKay: jorenl_: Chrome 14 is fundamentally broken with websockets
[22:11] jorenl_: so I should just force it to use some other protocol
[22:11] jorenl_: and since chrome is like the only websocket supporting browser, disable websockets completely?

[23:41] stoplights: when pasting and running it in node console, it works
[23:41] stoplights: but when calling  "node example.js" from command line
[23:41] jonnytran: yeah, this is my first time here, and it just seemed a little odd that there's hundreds of people here and it's completely silent
[23:41] stoplights: it gives a process.nextTick error
[23:41] tbranyen: jonnytran: welcome to irc...
[23:41] jonnytran: thanks
[23:42] stoplights: SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[23:42] tbranyen: hundreds of people connected, doesn't mean 100 people are reading everything you say
[23:42] jonnytran: as you may have guessed, i'm new to node and trying to install it on snow leopard
[23:42] stoplights: thought i'd ask here before i boot up VMWare or look in the source  ;)
[23:42] jonnytran: getting this error running make

[23:45] stoplights: anybody run into this problem with "01SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL01"?
[23:45] DrMcKay: jonnytran: nothing bad, just remove node from your build directory and rebuild
[23:46] tbranyen: or just make clean?
[23:46] jmoyers: stoplights what example?
[23:46] jmoyers: stoplights code?
[23:46] Acolyte: stoplights: yes, it means that your ejs, jade or jqtpl runs into unexpected character when compiling the template
[23:47] stoplights: from googling, it seems like a common error thrown in node
[23:47] ecin has joined the channel
[23:47] jonnytran: DrMcKay: thanks, that worked
[23:47] stoplights: i installed the windows binary and just ran the first sample code from http://nodejs.org/
[23:48] stoplights: do i need to add node to path or some other environment tweak?  it works fine from node console, but not from invoking the script as an argument
[23:48] jonnytran: tbranyen: make clean did not remove out/ and node symlink for some reason
[23:50] tbranyen: weird
[23:50] tbranyen: good to know

[23:51] quackquack: What should I use insead of `require.path` so that my code isnt full of `require("../../../bla")`?
[23:51] jmoyers: stoplights its almost certainly a copy paste error
[23:51] Acolyte: __dirname
[23:51] jmoyers: whats the stack trace? it should be highlighting a particular line
