[00:01] Bwen: you know you dont have to, to learn node though right?
[00:01] derick_skibotn: how do I implement persistent fields in express?
[00:01] Bwen: whats express?
[00:01] ptimothyp: Yep... 
[00:01] derick_skibotn: rails/sinatra-like framework
[00:01] ptimothyp: It is a web framework sitting on top of node
[00:02] Bwen: derick_skibotn: ohhh... ic... do they have a channel?
[00:02] ptimothyp: I am new to express @derick don't have a clue what you are talking about
[00:02] derick_skibotn: When I render a form how can I repopulate the fields?
[00:02] gwm__ has joined the channel
[00:02] derick_skibotn: pimothyp: maybe someone else here does?
[00:02] ptimothyp: Yep... maybe
[00:02] Bwen: we'll find out :>
[00:02] insin: derick_skibotn: as in redisplaying with errors?
[00:02] derick_skibotn: Let's say a user has to fill out an address form
[00:02] ptimothyp: @Bwen not too sure if they have one for express
[00:02] avalanche123 has joined the channel
[00:02] derick_skibotn: and they botch one of the fields
[00:03] derick_skibotn: I'd like to render that form back, with all fields but the botched one containing the known data
[00:03] kmiyashiro: persistent?
[00:03] kmiyashiro: oh
[00:03] derick_skibotn: By persistent I mean they don't have to type all the fields in again
[00:03] kmiyashiro: just send the data back
[00:03] kmiyashiro: in the render
[00:03] derick_skibotn: Yes, there would be a flash with error messages at the top, with the layout
[00:03] insin: I ported Django's forms library for that purpose: https://github.com/insin/newforms
[00:04] derick_skibotn: kmiyashiro: dumb question -- how do I send the data back?
[00:04] insin: (Still need to go back and make the whole thing async for validation which needs I/O, though)
[00:04] derick_skibotn: Do I need to use it in the template explicitly?
[00:04] kmiyashiro: I don't know, I barely know how to program
[00:04] kmiyashiro: haha
[00:04] kmiyashiro: but
[00:04] derick_skibotn: In Rails this was all automatic
[00:04] kmiyashiro: I've used express for one prototype
[00:04] kmiyashiro: from what I gather
[00:04] kmiyashiro: you can do your validation on submit
[00:04] kmiyashiro: and then if invalid, respond with an error and the data that was submitted
[00:05] kmiyashiro: and have a handler on the frontend that just re-populates it
[00:05] kmiyashiro: or
[00:05] derick_skibotn: what's the code for that?
[00:05] kmiyashiro: why not just do an ajax submit?
[00:05] kmiyashiro: so the data is never wiped
[00:05] ptimothyp: Can't you just populate the html form manually ?
[00:05] ptimothyp: from the server ?
[00:05] kmiyashiro: you can
[00:05] kmiyashiro: but that's so much work!
[00:05] kmiyashiro: are you using jquery or some other library?
[00:06] derick_skibotn: no, I'm just starting out
[00:06] derick_skibotn: express + nodejs
[00:06] flippyhead_ has joined the channel
[00:06] kmiyashiro: ah
[00:06] kmiyashiro: I'd use jquery on the frontend
[00:06] kmiyashiro: and just do an AJAX submit
[00:06] ptimothyp: Yep that would make things a lot easier
[00:07] derick_skibotn: Sometimes I need to change pages
[00:07] ryah: fight stupidity with shame
[00:07] kmiyashiro: I see
[00:07] kmiyashiro: well then in the render, you have to populate the local variables
[00:07] kmiyashiro: are you using a db?
[00:07] derick_skibotn: just sqlite3 right now
[00:07] kmiyashiro: do a get for the form data
[00:07] kmiyashiro: then pass it to the view

[00:49] brendanjerwin: ok, up to date now, but it never creates a directory when I run npm install module
[00:50] isaacs: brendanjerwin: to get 1.0, you can follow the instructions on the npm github readme

Lame!", until after actually learning how they work and what they do I find them absolutely invaluable! So here I am now again saying "node.js?! Why does anyone need this?" and the FAQ doesn't seem to be helping much, or the wiki or the api documentation... Could I use this to make a upnp server ?
[02:54] tmpvar: Xedecimal, sure
[02:54] Xedecimal: it also says "evented i/o for v8 javascript" does this mean that node.js works on nothing but chrome ?
[02:54] tmpvar: its a server side platform
[02:55] konobi: v8 is a vm
[02:55] tmpvar: right
[02:55] konobi: it's not tied to chrome

[02:55] Xedecimal: so this thing isn't actually meant to run inside a web browser on the client side ?

[02:56] konobi: Xedecimal: node is being used (on the serverside) to generate all the tarball downloads on github, for example
[02:57] konobi: Xedecimal: s/php|ruby/javascript/
[02:57] konobi: that's what node is
[02:57] tmpvar: heh
[02:57] tmpvar: there is truth in that
[02:57] konobi: well, more than that... but that's the basic way to look at it
[02:57] Xedecimal: I run a nix in a vm, but primarily a windows user
[02:58] tmpvar: Xedecimal, we are working on a native windows port.. right now you have to use cygwin
[02:58] Xedecimal: I use virtualbox for nix
[02:58] mbrevoort has joined the channel
[02:58] tmpvar: nice, I'd recommend trying it out
[02:58] Xedecimal: which seems to work much better than cygwin, lol
[02:58] tmpvar: yes. no jokes ;)
[02:59] Xedecimal: so, node.js is actually more like an application development platform, rather than a web-based server integration right ?
[02:59] tmpvar: it is a platform, yes
[02:59] konobi: it's great for writing network servers
[03:00] konobi: it's a server-side javascript runtime
[03:00] konobi: (with a bunch of useful core libraries)
[03:00] Xedecimal: you say that node.js is what github uses to compress and send tar compressed packages on github, you mean when it says "hardcore computing action" or whatever when you're attempting to download an git repo ?
[03:00] konobi: yup
[03:00] ngs has joined the channel
[03:01] tmpvar: Xedecimal, for example: https://nodeload.github.com/creationix/nstore/zipball/v0.3.0
[03:01] tmpvar: that will give you a tarball :)
[03:01] tmpvar: zipball, sorry
[03:01] tmpvar: nodeload is an awesome name btw
[03:02] Xedecimal: but this wouldn't be such a good idea for designing a desktop application as much as it's more designated to creating servers and portions of servers ?
[03:02] Xedecimal: like say someone ports gtk over to a node.js module and then could be used for a gui application I mean
[03:03] Xedecimal: why not just design an application in java that is portable and pre-compiled and nice and fast ?
[03:03] tmpvar: because its java :(
[03:03] intel_ix has joined the channel
[03:04] tmpvar: but yes, there are things in progress in the desktop app realm 
[03:04] Xedecimal: java always sucked the balls when sun was running things, now that oracle is around I've found that netbeans and java are really getting pretty nice, I even ported a game from .net over to lwjgl and it ran better with less code on java than it's C# predecessor
[03:04] Xedecimal: so then java out, what about python ?
[03:05] Xedecimal: what about perl ? What about ruby on the application side? I can package up a php binary to execute php code as an application including gtk support
[03:05] konobi: Xedecimal: there's always prism
[03:05] Xedecimal: *looks up prism*
[03:05] litropy has joined the channel
[03:06] Xedecimal: gotcha, this thing basically generates a lightweight browser meant to run just a single page, whereas you have multiple browser options to run any page you want, kinda like google gears, allowing you to run a few things on the go but they eventually decided that was actually a bad idea
[03:07] Corren has joined the channel
[03:07] brettgoulder has joined the channel
[03:07] konobi: there's also a chrome equivalent
[03:08] Xedecimal: my current passion is development of a media library interface for indexing media on all drives across a network, in comparison of tools like xmbc I've never been able to compete on the server side, because this all runs on php in a web browser and on a web server, I couldn't actually create a server or run something consistently, just per-request does execution happen
[03:08] Xedecimal: when I first saw node.js I immediately thought (and this is why I previously asked if I could create a upnp server with it), "I wonder if I could use this node.js to create a upnp server and finally start bridging the gap over there"
[03:09] litropy: Hmm
[03:09] Xedecimal: but if I were to do something like that, I'd end up having to package up another dependency in my application right ?
[03:10] konobi: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-upnp-client
[03:10] litropy: When I "$ node" on my first computer, it enters me into the node cli. When I "$ node" on my second computer, it tells me node isn't installed. Yet I just sudo aptitude install nodejs'ed. Ideas?
[03:11] uho has joined the channel
[03:11] tbranyen: litropy: is it nodejs on that box?
[03:11] litropy: tbranyen, yes
[03:11] tbranyen: i mean is the binary called nodejs
[03:11] Xedecimal: litropy: if you installed node from a parent console, like su'ing and it may have altered a path or such, then you exited that and attempted to run it, it'd still not be availble because the old console was not aware of the new available executable
[03:11] tbranyen: instead of node
[03:11] litropy: adam@Quorra:~$ nodejs -v
[03:11] litropy: 0.1.97

[03:23] litropy: U'm looking for something-dev and something-build-essentials

[04:31] A_Nub: Yes and no
[04:32] A_Nub: Its hard when you don't get specific.
[04:32] systemfault: It is.
[04:32] A_Nub: if you decided to code to something specific then it becomes easier
[04:32] A_Nub: A lot of libraries try to be too general which is what can cause the crazy things

[04:34] A_Nub: So far, OBJ-C and its NextStep library is my favorite.

[04:37] A_Nub: I hated it at first
[04:37] A_Nub: it grows on you.

[04:37] systemfault: Basically, you suffer from the stockholm syndrome for ObjC? :)
[04:37] A_Nub: maybe
[04:37] A_Nub: But it follows a callback model
[04:37] A_Nub: which is nice
[04:37] systemfault: I think I do... for JS :/

[04:38] A_Nub: great language.

[05:01] dhasenan: ryah, thanks.
[05:02] mdaisuke has joined the channel
[05:04] mdwright: systemfault: true enough. I suppose I just haven't used those features enough to run into a case where strict is necessary
[05:04] n2liquid has joined the channel
[05:04] systemfault: mdwright: Just write a test, create an object, freeze it then try to modify it
[05:05] systemfault: Without strict mode, it simply doesn't make any sense :/
[05:05] MikhX has joined the channel
[05:05] mdwright: systemfault: oh, no, I understood the argument and agree. I just didn't realize that was the case / haven't used those features enough.
[05:05] systemfault: Ahhh, pardon
[05:09] rmustacc: ryah: I think I would problably end up doing it differently. I didn't have select in mind. Let me sketch it out a bit more in my head.
[05:09] rmustacc: Not sure if it's cleaner though.

[05:10] n2liquid: is NodeJS good enough on Cygwin?
[05:10] secoif has left the channel
[05:11] ryah: n2liquid: good enough for what?
[05:11] n2liquid: ryah: how does it compare to the Linux native?
[05:11] timmywil has joined the channel
[05:11] ryah: sucks
[05:11] puffpio: lol
[05:12] n2liquid: ryah: why?
[05:12] puffpio: is it faster to run a linux VM and run node inside
[05:12] n2liquid: lol
[05:12] n2liquid: probably not
[05:12] systemfault: n2liquid: Don't mind ryah, he doesn't know what he's talking about
[05:12] systemfault: </troll>
[05:12] bingomanatee has joined the channel
[05:12] n2liquid: systemfault: lolololol
[05:12] Aria: Because cygwin is a pretty heavy layer and fakes a lot.
[05:13] n2liquid: ah
[05:13] n2liquid: ok, but
[05:13] systemfault: I'd use a VM if I were you
[05:13] n2liquid: systemfault, Aria: is it good enough for a client application, though?
[05:13] Aria: What sort of client application?
[05:14] n2liquid: Aria: the non-mathematical part of a game
[05:14] n2liquid: and a simple game, at that
[05:14] Aria: Probably, then!
[05:14] Aria: It runs. 
[05:14] n2liquid: hm
[05:14] n2liquid: Aria, ryah: is the purpose of libev destroyed by Cygwin?
[05:15] n2liquid: (I mean, does it make it a slow waste?)
[05:15] tbranyen: n2liquid: cygwin destroys all it touches
[05:15] onre has joined the channel
[05:16] systemfault: I would install it by default on every Windows then ;)
[05:16] n2liquid: tbranyen: didn't know it was that bad
[05:16] n2liquid: aren't you guys overdoing it?
[05:16] rmustacc: The Win32 APIs and the POSIX ones are quite different in a lot of areas. Cygwin tries hard, but it's not the best. The question of getting good io is why liboio is being worked on.
[05:17] n2liquid: rmustacc: libev isn't hit by the polling stuff?
[05:17] n2liquid: on Cygwin, that is
[05:18] rmustacc: Unlikely. While I'm not the most familiar with that code base you have to keep in mind the notion of a file descriptor doesn't exist in the standard Windows APIs
[05:19] rmustacc: Select for example exists nominally but is capped at either 32/64 fds.
[05:19] rmustacc: Instead Windows uses something called I/O completion ports.
[05:19] systemfault: Win32 Overlapped IO?
[05:19] n2liquid: yeah, I know Windows has its own answers to IO and everything, but I'd guess Cygwin doesn't use all that?
[05:19] ryah: n2liquid: no cygwin has select
[05:20] ryah: n2liquid: so libev uses select there
[05:20] ryah: poll actually
[05:20] n2liquid: ryah: and does it work well?
[05:20] ryah: there's no overhead from libev
[05:20] systemfault: Something like cygwin must be conservative.. Not sure that performance is the goal
[05:20] n2liquid: hm, sure
[05:20] ryah: it sucks because cygwin sucks
[05:20] n2liquid: lol
[05:21] systemfault: ryah: Totally offtopic question... Do you speak french?
[05:21] ryah: no

[05:24] A_Nub: n2liquid: or try to get a server on no.de
[05:24] n2liquid: ryah: ah, that's perfect
[05:24] A_Nub: and test from there
[05:24] systemfault: ryah: It will be possible to compile it with nmake/cl.exe? :P
[05:24] A_Nub: its only 128mb ram
[05:24] A_Nub: but should be more than enough for testing
[05:24] systemfault: ryah: Or we'll need msys/mingw
[05:24] ryah: systemfault: no, but with mingw probably
[05:24] systemfault: Ah ok :)
[05:25] rmustacc: ryah: Do you remember off hand if you can be cancelled while in wait(2)?
[05:25] n2liquid: ryah: I know you hate Windows and I know you have good reasons to, and I wouldn't be on Windows if I weren't on games, but I'd like to thank you for working on a Windows port even when you hate it
[05:26] ryah: rmustacc: you can recv signals - so, i think so
[05:26] n2liquid: I have my reasons to dislike OpenGL too, so even though I hate Windows, I want to use Direct3D
[05:26] onre_ has joined the channel
[05:26] ryah: n2liquid: i dont hate windows
[05:26] n2liquid: so it's good you'll make that possible
[05:26] n2liquid: oh, you don't?
[05:26] A_Nub: OpenGL <3
[05:26] mjr_: ryah doesn't hate Windows, just JavaScript.
[05:26] A_Nub: Direct X </3
[05:26] systemfault: n2liquid: Yeah, D3D is definitely superior
[05:26] ryah: n2liquid: http://tinyclouds.org/iocp-links.html
[05:26] systemfault: But OGL is portable..
[05:27] n2liquid: systemfault: yeah, that's why I abstract both away
[05:27] A_Nub: D3D will be outdated soon, its a never ending tug-o-war
[05:27] n2liquid: I may support OpenGL, but I can't drop D3D right now
[05:27] m64253 has joined the channel
[05:27] systemfault: A_Nub: It won't be, the worst that could happen is that D3D becomes a XBOX-only API if Windows Dies (Which is unlikely)
[05:28] A_Nub: What I mean is IF OGL ever moves into its new api
[05:28] A_Nub: it should be superior
[05:28] A_Nub: But im not counting on it
[05:28] A_Nub: haha
[05:28] systemfault: A_Nub: Ah... well, lobbying killed OGL
[05:28] systemfault: Big companies don't like changes.
[05:28] n2liquid: ryah: I was pretty sure you asked Windows users why did they eat shit all day, so how come you don't hate Windows? are you being ironic?

[05:53] hoopi2: okay
[05:53] A_Nub: if you are following that link
[05:53] A_Nub: on the wiki
[05:53] A_Nub: it installs to a user folder
[05:54] A_Nub: and sudo is uneccessary
[05:54] hoopi2: yeah i know
[05:54] hoopi2: oh?
[05:54] A_Nub: I suggest not using sudo
[05:54] hoopi2: so i ca just do make install?
[05:54] A_Nub: it just is a hassle with permissions.

[07:41] ckknight: for your actual issue, the issue is that you're returning from the inner callback, not from the outer function
[07:41] ckknight: so what you need to do is instead of returning, call some callback
[07:41] ckknight: callback(body);
[07:41] ckknight: and that does other stuff.

[09:27] mjr_: even tens of thousands, and it's often OK
[09:28] mjr_: But in my experience, somewhere past 100,000, things start to get really slow.

[09:28] mjr_: Obviously not the right answer for many applications

[09:29] mjr_: But the V8 GC tax comes into play when dealing with a large heap that often accompanies a large object.

[11:31] Heath_Carruthers: AND faster

[11:44] Heath_Carruthers: IPC - Basically I want the data to come into the primary socket, from the clients, and then sent to the secondary socket for processing like db requests etc
[11:44] Heath_Carruthers: I need full real time, not polling or comet
[11:45] TheDeveloper: polling/comet is more cross-network RPC, IPC involves net sockets
[11:45] TheDeveloper: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.7/api/net.html
[11:48] Heath_Carruthers: yeah
[11:48] Heath_Carruthers: dragged my eyes over that but I cant seem to fathom what Im missing
[11:48] TheDeveloper: so you have two processes
[11:48] TheDeveloper: flow is
[11:48] V1: Heath_Carruthers: Just because a dnode requires socket.io in the NPM package, it doesn't mean that it will also use it.. as it also has a TCP abstraction
[11:49] TheDeveloper: remote client -> process a -> socket -> process b
[11:49] TheDeveloper: you open a socket server in process b and write to it from process a
[11:50] TheDeveloper: if you want full real time between client and process a, client -> socket.io (or other websocket server) -> socket -> process b
[11:51] Heath_Carruthers: http://pastebin.com/tS6HppFk

[12:55] unomi: socket.io has a number of fallbacks if websockets aren't available
[12:56] unomi: Socky is in Ruby. 
[12:56] __tomb: Would anyone be able to help me understand how I can create a ReadStream on a file that acts like tail -f? I am using createReadStream with the default options at the moment.
[12:57] unomi: Ruby is a nice language, but it seems very close to EOL for web based apps in the medium - long term
[12:57] moshe: i actually have used dnode, it's uses socket.io tho
[12:57] moshe: 'but it seems very close to EOL for web based apps in the medium - long term' what do you mean by that?
[12:58] unomi: if you are waffling between using nodejs or a Ruby backend, I think you need to give more thought to what you actually want to do
[12:59] unomi: I mean that it seems to lack a compelling reason to use it.  
[12:59] zivester: ACTION test
[12:59] moshe: well i know what imactully want to do, the problem is that im not sure how i should be doing it 
[12:59] unomi: the browser performance wars are on, nodejs will only get faster
[13:00] moshe: yeah i managed to understand that
[13:00] moshe: looks like websockets is the big thing now isnt it
[13:01] unomi: Ruby doesn't have a sponsor, many of the nice parts of the language have been co-opted by other languages such as Scala or even coffee-script
[13:01] unomi: the only upgrade path is to throw memory at it in JRuby or implement core in C
[13:01] unomi: and neither of those are particularly compelling

[13:45] jonaslund: jamey-uk: you need to structure your code slightly differently when using node
[13:45] jonaslund: jamey-uk: with java you can f.ex. start opening a file, read it and then just return it in one method and it's no problem since everything is threaded
[13:46] jamey-uk: jonaslund: so you have to think about not blocking anything all the time? how would you structure that same bit of code in node?
[13:46] jonaslund: jamey-uk: with node, you need to rewrite this to event processing, so when you get a request you rewrite it to a file opening event that's chained to reading, sending,etc
[13:46] jonaslund: exactly, don't block :)

[16:18] fairwinds: tjholowaychuk: heh. I think the value is not necessarily backbone itself but more that you have some decent model and collection objects, and that you have a way to interact with object state in a browser or some type of ui (that is not on the server side) 
[16:18] eazyigz_: tjholowaychuk: that is exactly what I'm doing, but no dice!
[16:19] tjholowaychuk: fairwinds yeah totally

[16:21] Aria: MVC makes sense in a GUI, where you maintain an abstract model and then concrete displays of those abstract things.
[16:22] fairwinds: tjholowaychuk: some of the ideas in backbone are good so being objective when I see that I don't need to throw away anything I am doing, but possibly just assimilate what is valuable there.

Like the server offers the client to pass a callback, how can I restrict to only a few func (ok - i should not have enable him to pass a cb - )? Or, even if i do not offer him to pass a cb, are they some parameters/functions, 
[16:31] djcoin: whatever, that may threat my server, and how to avoid this case ?

[17:52] ruquay: have you looked at the http part of the documentation?
[17:52] brez__ has joined the channel
[17:52] ruquay: when you get a request, you can access request.url on the request object
[17:53] ruquay: if you need to parse it, you can use the querystring library which is included.
[17:53] cm|tmp: I tried using url.parse

[17:56] Aikar: hmm, if an update makes something run twice as fast, would that be a 100% performance gain or would you say 200%?
[17:56] chrislorenz has joined the channel
[17:56] mattly_ has joined the channel
[17:56] ruquay: i would have to go with 100%.
[17:57] techwraith: 100%
[17:57] tjholowaychuk: 100% if you are saying "gain"
[17:57] ruquay: because if you choose 200%, then you would be saying that a 100% gain is going once as fast, which would make no sense at all
[17:57] Aikar: yeah
[17:57] Aikar: thats what i thought
[17:57] guireisc has joined the channel
[17:57] techwraith: you can say it's a 100% increase in performance, or you can say it's 200% of the current performance
[17:58] ruquay: or, you can wait until you make it three times as fast, and then say that it's a 200% performance gain ;-)

[18:16] tjholowaychuk: either the css/js are used uncompressed, then compressed, then cloudfront
[18:16] tjholowaychuk: whichever is available at the time
[18:16] Tobsn: save the metadata of the upload in redis, check against the file every once in a while, if local is newer you initiate a new version

[18:42] mraleph: mjr_: latest trunk should be fine
[18:42] mraleph: just checkout it
[18:43] mraleph: mjr_: does it fail with debug version of node?
[18:43] mjr_: not sure, but it happens under very heavy load.  node_g is so slow that I'm sure it'd be testing different conditions

[18:47] mscdex: ;-)
[18:47] saschagehlich: *at
[18:47] mraleph: mjr_: well it's not very odd. I recall pretty nasty bug in one of the nodejs packages I helped to debug once. Somebody was passing a pointer to int into some library which inside casted it to (void**) and then treated it as a pointer to a pointer   
[18:47] Bonuspunkt: css @ nodecamp? :D
[18:47] saschagehlich: sure, why not
[18:48] V1: Why not, there are geeks, with laptops + internet == free lan party
[18:48] mraleph: mjr_: so it was causing memory corruption on x64 but worked just fine on ia32
[18:48] jonaslund: ptrdiff_t for the win
[18:48] saschagehlich: just give me some time to do a css server in node... just to make it kind of topic-related
[18:48] mraleph: mjr_: and of course V8 has differences on ia32 and x64 so it might be an actual bug in V8
[18:48] jonaslund: (most reliable pointer sized integer if i'm not misstaken)
[18:48] mjr_: mraleph: hmm, we are using one C++ module, but I can try it without
[18:49] Bonuspunkt: wouldn't Q3 be easier do the fact the source is available?
[18:49] mscdex: heh
[18:49] V1: saschagehlich: If you have a working node-driven css server by the time node camp starts, i'll buy you a beer ;D

[19:17] tjholowaychuk: tbranyen: they use with()

[19:18] roman_ has joined the channel
[19:18] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: huh most of them use eval

[19:18] jonaslund: mraleph: when we were doing our games we usually validated "once per frame".. and once we found out when bugs happened we started adding manual validations to narrow down the scope until we found it

[19:18] mjr_: mraleph: want me to run it again under node_g, or try the latest V8?
[19:18] mjr_: Takes a while grinding along in node_g to repro
[19:18] jonaslund: mraleph: slow as shit but got things done one you knew how to crash things
[19:18] tbranyen: there was a templating framework you mentioned before tho
[19:19] tbranyen: wasn't in JS
[19:19] tbranyen: mindmelt
[19:19] tjholowaychuk: tbranyen: not sure what you are referencing haha. I dont know any that eval though, jade doesnt, ejs doesnt
[19:19] mraleph: mjr_: yeah, try the latest V8, I'll try to mediate on this stacktrace
[19:20] mraleph: jonaslund: well there is --verify-heap do verify the heap and there are some things to cause GC more often.
[19:20] mraleph: usually it's enough
[19:20] V1: I don't think jq templ eval as well, they use Function() to generate the code, not eval tbranyen
[19:21] mraleph: mjr_: ah, oh. this does not look very good.
[19:21] mjr_: it's just all corrupted, right?
[19:21] mraleph: mjr_: no. it's zapped with kFromSpaceZapValue
[19:21] jonaslund: mraleph: ah ok.. the node --v8-options flag didn't list it
[19:21] tbranyen: V1: its basically the same thing, very subtle difference
[19:21] mraleph: mjr_: that means that GC forgot to update some pointer
[19:22] mjr_: oh shit
[19:22] mraleph: mjr_: after collection
[19:22] tbranyen: its like saying the difference between new Function and eval for JSON->Object

[19:37] mscdex: and if i really wanted to be nitpicky like some are, i'd say don't do concatenation in the 'data' event. use an array and push to that and then join on 'end'

[21:17] sh1mmer: right
[21:17] wink_: DrDoom: you're not going to be able to do that solely in node
[21:17] stride: DrDoom: is that even possible in userspace?
[21:18] bradleymeck: drdoom you are looking at some OS level stuff, that generally cant be done in true userspace (though you might get same effect w/ something like iptables)
[21:18] akavlie: bradleymeck, https://gist.github.com/943173
[21:18] akavlie: that's the index.html
[21:18] DrDoom: Sure, I know about iptables, I was wondering if it is feasible, to write a simply clone in node
[21:18] wink_: your options are to shell out to iptables/ipf/etc or write a driver
[21:18] akavlie: take away the DOCTYPE and it works fine.
[21:19] bradleymeck: akavlie node side too
[21:19] akavlie: bradleymeck, server JS?
[21:19] bradleymeck: ya if you are serving it.
[21:20] akavlie: bradleymeck, https://gist.github.com/943181
[21:20] DrDoom: So it is even possible to write node code that simply blocks all traffic on all interfaces? That would be the first step.
[21:20] eazyigz_: if I run node with nohup, i do not see stdout
[21:20] akavlie: bradleymeck, looks a bit messy as it's compiled from CoffeeScript.
[21:20] eazyigz_: I'm not sure what is the proper way to run node with nohup...
[21:21] wink_: DrDoom: not stock, no.
[21:21] wink_: DrDoom: you could write a binding to libnetfilter_queue that could probably do it
[21:21] wink_: but you'd need a binding for it
[21:21] lessthanzero has joined the channel
[21:22] stride: akavlie: ".css".substr(-4) != "css", your mime types might be wrong which might cause issues outside of quirks mode
[21:22] DrDoom: Right, bummer. Yeah iptables is a headache, was thinking of making a simple alternative in node, with a built in RESTful API
[21:22] stride: try if a -3 down there helps
[21:22] wink_: DrDoom: the right way to go is to bind up libnetfilter and run with that

[21:28] davida has joined the channel

[21:42] jonaslund: Postmodernist: there is a scheme to JS compiler written by the "hop" guys
[21:43] Postmodernist: And it works with node.js inline?
[21:43] gonsfx: when im accessing a mongoose model inside an express-app controller function (say, a user by email) and no result is found, i want to pass control by using next()
[21:43] gonsfx: i can't do if (!user.length) next(); res.render('user.jade'); but need to use if/else so i dont get "can't set headers after they are sent" error. can someone explain why?
[21:43] piscisaureus: mraleph: So calling SetIndexedProperties.. does not make crankshaft recompile buffer accesses?
[21:43] piscisaureus: mraleph: And is it also not possible to map a range that does not start with 0, e.g. map a[1000] ... a[2000] to a buffer?
[21:43] piscisaureus: 
[21:44] mraleph: yes it is not possible
[21:44] piscisaureus: mraleph: :'-(
[21:44] mraleph: though it is obviously possible to map 1000 into 0 and 2000 into 1000
[21:45] piscisaureus: mraleph: yes obviously
[21:45] mraleph: why?
[21:45] mraleph: why do you need such a strange features?
[21:45] piscisaureus: mraleph: suppose I want to join two buffers together without reallocating and copying both to a new memory space
[21:46] piscisaureus: mraleph: the obvious trick would be to tell v8 about both of them
[21:46] brownies has joined the channel
[21:46] Venom_X_ has joined the channel
[21:46] piscisaureus: but if that can't be done
[21:46] piscisaureus: I could map just one of them, then if the user makes an out of bound access map the other one
[21:47] piscisaureus: since in most situations buffers would be accessed linearly that wouldn't be so bad
[21:47] piscisaureus: The other thing is
[21:47] piscisaureus: That I want to make external data arrays (or even worse: parts of them) read-only
[21:48] jonaslund: piscisaureus: what are you up to really ?
[21:50] KillerX has joined the channel
[21:50] piscisaureus: jonaslund: https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/628
[21:50] KillerX: anyone know of a quick way to tell which platform you are running on?
[21:51] KillerX: i.e. I would like to execute some conditional code if my node.js script was invoked in a mac environment as opposed to Linux
[21:51] mscdex: KillerX: process.platform
[21:51] ukev has joined the channel
[21:51] KillerX: mscdex: many thanks!
[21:52] jonaslund: piscisaureus: yeah but why that buffer-magic-merging thing ?
[21:52] pquerna: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2487331 <- cast is written in node.js :)
[21:53] piscisaureus: jonaslund: it's kinda the same. Suppose that you want to make a part of a buffer read-only. That is not unlikely because multiple buffer objects can reference the same memory by slicing them.
[21:54] jonaslund: piscisaureus: ahh right that thing
[21:54] jonaslund: piscisaureus: it would give some orthogonality yeah
[21:54] jonaslund: piscisaureus: the question is if the price is worth it ?
[21:54] piscisaureus: jonaslund: sure but I don't even know what the price is
[21:55] piscisaureus: jonaslund: I was bugging mraleph to find out :-)
[21:55] eee_c has joined the channel
[21:56] jonaslund: piscisaureus: personally i think the sane thing would not to have a slice function mapping into another array.. but now it's there and people have to do with it i guess
[21:59] sveimac has joined the channel
[21:59] piscisaureus: jonaslund: that would make some stuff very difficult -- like efficiently managing read buffers. Currently every time node reads from a socket it reads into a "big" buffer. Then if that buffer isn't used entirely that a sliced reference is returned to the user and the rest of the buffer can be used for a subsequent read.
[22:02] jonaslund: piscisaureus: well i'm off the old school "allocate your own damn buffers" philosophy :)
[22:02] jonaslund: but it's just an opinion :)
[22:02] piscisaureus: jonaslund: for 0.6 this will be even more important because iocp requires you to preallocate read buffers for all your sockets. So if you open 10K may need to preallocate 640 MB of memory
[22:03] amerine has joined the channel
[22:03] piscisaureus: *open 10K sockets
[22:04] jonaslund: piscisaureus: auch
[22:05] pcardune_ has joined the channel
[22:05] jonaslund: piscisaureus: tricky that.. 64k is a pretty big amount of memory in those situations.. but then again you'd prolly loose performance if you're doing high bandwidth stuff with few connections
[22:06] jonaslund: piscisaureus: I'm not entirely sure about the buffer-merging still ?
[22:07] MikhX has joined the channel
[22:07] piscisaureus: jonaslund: yes we would need to do some auto-scaling of the read buffer size I think. I'm not really sure how atm./
[22:08] christophsturm has joined the channel
[22:08] gonsfx: i'll try to reformulate: is there any difference between calling next() and returning next() in express besides stopping execution of current middleware?

[22:08] jonaslund: piscisaureus: sounds like a "tuneable" to me.. however dirty it feels :)
[22:08] piscisaureus: jonaslund: about the buffer merging: I'd like to allocate buffers the size of page
[22:08] mischief has joined the channel
[22:09] piscisaureus: send multiple buffers to readv or WSARecv
[22:09] tjholowaychuk: gonsfx: no difference
[22:09] gonsfx: tjholowaychuk: thanks :)
[22:09] tjholowaychuk: gonsfx: just beats having a bunch of elses all over some times
[22:09] piscisaureus: then when bytes_read > page_size string combine expose all used pages as one buffer object
[22:09] gonsfx: couldn't find one from a quick view over the connect source, but wasn't sure about it
[22:10] gonsfx: yeah, that was exactly why i was asking. too many cascading if/else :)
[22:10] piscisaureus: jonaslund: let me rephrase that... 01when bytes_read > page_size expose all pages that contain read data as one buffer object01
[22:11] jonaslund: piscisaureus: hmm.. why not fire multiple data events instead ?
[22:11] piscisaureus: jonaslund: yes that's an alternative I think

[22:11] broofa has joined the channel
[22:12] jonaslund: piscisaureus: it might feel "smooth" to be able to catch big stuff in one go.. but if at some point your code will need to handle big requests then it's far better if you get a chance to debug that code
[22:12] boaz has joined the channel
[22:12] jonaslund: piscisaureus: oh and if people do alot of string decoding,etc they'd get huge objects that's prolly not that nice to the GC if you pump big buffers onto them
[22:12] mdaisuke has joined the channel
[22:13] piscisaureus: jonaslund: I guess the gc would like that better actually, though it could be less memory-efficient
[22:13] piscisaureus: well maybe not the huge strings
[22:14] jonaslund: piscisaureus: if people process their data instead of hanging around that'd be more efficient :)
[22:15] jonaslund: piscisaureus: as for 10k memory consumption.... http.createServer(reqListener,{readBufferSize:4096}); or something alike that for people to be able to tune stuff

[23:17] mikeal: line 1193
[23:17] mikeal: what is that all about?
[23:17] mikeal: we're emitting an error and a request that hasn't even been assigned to this socket
[23:17] mikeal: we assing a request to a socket before it's even finished connecting?

[23:23] techwraith: unless they have debug support somehow
[23:24] mikeal: and in that handler, the pool is empty, because it was removed by another error handler when it shouldn't have been
[23:24] mikeal: and the original socket that got an error was removed on close or something
[23:24] bingomanatee:  /me likes it in the basement.
[23:24] mikeal: mjr_: does that make sense?

[23:31] mjr_: sure
[23:32] mikeal: remove that ifelse on line 1193
[23:32] mikeal: remove the else as well
[23:32] mikeal: move the req.emit('error') to the if statement
[23:32] zzak: elliotcable: haters gonna hate
[23:32] mikeal: do nothing with a request if that if doesn't work
[23:32] cloudhea1: is there anything special I need to do to receive stdout from a child_process without calling end()?
[23:33] mikeal: that won't work for core
[23:33] mikeal: but it should work for you

[23:34] mjr_: mikeal: so like:  https://gist.github.com/2c74c3c0522f1f8829dd
[23:34] elliottcable: zzak: I always thought that meme was a little unfair to us haters. We *do* have human discretion, you know; we can electively LOVE instead of HATE when we so please! #surprise #sarcasm
[23:35] amerine has joined the channel
[23:35] mikeal: the reason it won't work in core is that it means that you'll never get a request error on the first request you create if you can't connect

[23:35] mjr_: oh, that's bad.  I want to be able to detect if a host is down.  I have a pool of addresses that I round robin through
[23:36] dandean has left the channel
[23:36] zzak: haters are just emotionally extreme, its either love or hate
[23:36] mikeal: so
[23:36] mikeal: the *real* fix, is to assign a request object to a socket when it's created
[23:37] mikeal: and if i errors it's already referenced
[23:37] mikeal: instead of this crazy dance between the queue and the connection creation
[23:37] mikeal: but that's a sizable refactor
[23:37] mjr_: what if you don't have enough sockets?  That req has to go somewhere
[23:38] konobi: anyone aware of any expect libraries for node?
[23:39] konobi: hopefully well maintained

[23:40] kristofferh has joined the channel
[23:40] zzak: expect as in bdd?
[23:40] zzak: konobi ^
[23:40] jmorris: i have a dumb question, on os x, when i, say npm supervisor, how do i then just be able to type supervisor -p app.js?

[23:42] konobi: zzak: as in TCL expect

[23:43] piscisaureus: cloudhea1: the program you are calling is probably buffering up its output
[23:44] mikeal: mjr_: no no no, the req is in queue
[23:44] mikeal: when a socket is closed/freed
[23:44] mikeal: a req is popped off the queue, assigned to a socket that is probably not even open yet
[23:44] zzak: konobi: none that i know of :/
[23:45] mikeal: why is Tim not in here?
[23:45] zzak: there might be some tcl/tk bindings floating around

[23:46] tbranyen: mikeal: he hasn't been for a while, said he was busy busy busy
[23:46] cloudhea1: piscisaureus: that's what I thought, but running it in the console works as expected
[23:46] rchavik has joined the channel
[23:46] cloudhea1: piscisaureus: ie on every \n it outputs something
[23:46] mikeal: he can't go releasing new libraries and not be on irc to discuss them with me

[23:47] jesusabdullah: who wrote a library?
[23:47] cloudhea1: piscisaureus: however doing proc.stdin.write('foo\n') yeilds nothing in the stdout channel
[23:48] piscisaureus: cloudhea1: hmm. maybe your child detects the type of stream?
[23:48] piscisaureus: cloudhea1: what are you calling?
[23:49] cloudhea1: piscisaureus: would the type of stream be non-standard?
[23:49] cloudhea1: piscisaureus: it's a wrapper around the pandoc library
[23:50] piscisaureus: cloudhea1: hmm, doesn't ring a bell. The type of stream is tty when you call it from a terminal. If you're running it from node it's gonna be a pipe.
[23:51] piscisaureus: cloudhea1: try to write a lot of lines to it, see if you get a data event eventually
[23:51] cloudhea1: oh I see
[23:53] dandean has joined the channel
[23:53] cloudhea1: piscisaureus: running `echo foo | pandocd` gives me some output
[23:54] cloudhea1: ie with a pipe, not sure if it's the same kind node uses though
[23:54] piscisaureus: cloudhea1: you're still not giving it a pipe for stdout.
[23:54] cloudhea1: ah yes
[23:54] piscisaureus: cloudhea1: plus its stdin gets closed, most programs will terminate after that
[23:55] piscisaureus: cloudhea1: probably if you call child.stdin.end() you'll get output within node too.
[23:55] kylefox has joined the channel
[23:55] piscisaureus: cloudhea1: try `pandocd | cat` to find out :-)
[23:56] cloudhea1: piscisaureus: yea that seems to work too
[23:56] cloudhea1: piscisaureus: the problem is I can't end() it, I need to keep the process open
[23:57] kylefox has left the channel
[23:57] piscisaureus: hmm. does writing a lot help?
[23:57] cloudhea1: doesn't seem like it
[23:57] cloudhea1: gonna try from node directly
[23:58] piscisaureus: maybe it outputs to stderr?
[23:59] cloudhea1: got a watcher on that thoo : /
[23:59] cloudhea1: too*
