[00:00] mikeal: but it's all async
[00:00] rchavik has joined the channel
[00:00] mikeal: and it has a lot of semantics about killing and closing transactions on the browser equivolent of nextTick()
[00:00] mikeal: and i hit this weird bug with doing ajax calls while my transaction was in a closure
[00:00] bingomanatee has joined the channel
[00:00] mikeal: and after i fixed it I thought "coding in the browser is like coding in node now"
[00:01] mikeal: makes me really skeptical about all this stuff people are doing trying to make node more like the browser
[00:01] tjholowaychuk: i try to make my CS stuff more like node
[00:01] tjholowaychuk: .on instead of addEventListener n shit
[00:01] tk has joined the channel
[00:02] mikeal: for a second i thought you mean CS == CoffeeScript
[00:02] bingomanatee: ACTION wants a dom based file system
[00:02] tjholowaychuk: haha

[00:02] tjholowaychuk: tm
[00:02] tiglionabbit: Marak: ok I read the weld readme, but I don't quite understand -- If you're on the client side, and you want to template something and add it to the page, where do you get your template from?
[00:02] tjholowaychuk: i like jison
[00:02] tjholowaychuk: coffeescript uses that
[00:02] tjholowaychuk: lol
[00:03] dcampano has joined the channel
[00:03] briznad has joined the channel
[00:04] mikeal: the talk jashkenas did at JSConf he encouraged everyone to write their own language instead of just using coffeescript
[00:04] tjholowaychuk: i wouldnt really call outputting js writing a language
[00:04] tjholowaychuk: it's like writing a lexer, using someone elses parser
[00:04] tjholowaychuk: and outputing some strings
[00:04] tiglionabbit: tjholowaychuk: that's what all compilers do
[00:05] tjholowaychuk: compilers are far more complex
[00:05] tiglionabbit: by that measure, C is not a language.  It just outputs assembly.
[00:05] mikeal: compilers do a lot more than that dude
[00:05] mikeal: read the dragon book
[00:05] tiglionabbit: a compiler is just a translater
[00:05] tiglionabbit: it translates one language into another
[00:05] tjholowaychuk: comparing something like gcc to CS, makes no sense
[00:05] tjholowaychuk: lol
[00:05] mikeal: the kinds of optimizations compiles and vms make are far greater than what a toJavaScript compiler does
[00:05] sechrist has joined the channel
[00:06] mikeal: tiglionabbit: not any modern compiler or vm
[00:06] tiglionabbit: you don't have to have optimizations to be called a compiler
[00:06] mikeal: sure, in the abstract you are correct
[00:06] mikeal: but in the abstract, template systems are compilers
[00:06] tiglionabbit: this is like saying scripting languages are not the same as programming languages
[00:06] Twelve-60 has joined the channel
[00:06] mikeal: and we don't call them that, cause that would be stupid
[00:06] tjholowaychuk: all im saying, is it's not hard to translate a parse tree to an existing language
[00:06] mikegerwitz: A compiler, by definition, transforms source code into a target language. The target langauge does not have to be machine code.
[00:07] tiglionabbit: mikeal: well, we don't consider templates to be languages in the same way that programming languages are.  They are usually not turing complete
[00:07] mikeal: i've seen templates that are as far from js as coffeescript is and compile down to it
[00:07] tjholowaychuk: and they are super basic because they have no runtime
[00:07] tiglionabbit: tjholowaychuk: assembly is an existing language
[00:07] tjholowaychuk: you just output some crap
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: tiglionabbit yes i get it
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: good job
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: lol
[00:08] tiglionabbit: hehe, sorry
[00:08] mikeal: here is the difference i think tj is trying to make
[00:08] mikeal: take a block of coffeescript
[00:08] mikeal: stick it anywhere in any coffeescript file
[00:08] tiglionabbit: you could have just said "coffeescript isn't as impressive as most compilers" :P
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: sure
[00:09] tjholowaychuk: i'll phrase it like that next time lol
[00:09] mikeal: when you find that block in the compile target, it always looks the same
[00:09] tjholowaychuk: "it's super basic"
[00:09] mikeal: but if you did that to a block of C code, it would be drastically different depending on where it existed in the program
[00:10] tiglionabbit: mikeal: why should it?  If you change the order in which two functions are defined in a C file, I don't see why the output should be different
[00:10] mikeal: for something that simplistic, *maybe*
[00:11] tjholowaychuk: you're right, CS is totally as complicated as gcc
[00:11] tjholowaychuk: haha
[00:11] tjholowaychuk: totally
[00:11] tiglionabbit: I didn't say that :P
[00:11] mikeal: but compilers do a lot more to optimize instructions based on the context they appear in
[00:11] mikeal: maybe not gcc, but at least llvm :P
[00:11] ryanallenbobcat has joined the channel
[00:12] mikeal: but seriously, llvm is fuckin hot
[00:13] tiglionabbit: mikeal: coffeescript actually does care about context in some ways.  Write a function that defines a local variable, then define that variable outside the function too.  The function reacts to the context.  This is actually a scary thing to me though, because it means coffeescript brings some ruby gotchas to javascript (shadowing variables is not allowed)
[00:13] Marak: tiglionabbit: the html is the template
[00:13] mikeal: i think in like 10 years only really old projecst will be using standard gcc
[00:13] mikeal: tiglionabbit: that's called a closure
[00:13] mikeal: :P
[00:13] Marak: tiglionabbit: check out https://github.com/hij1nx/weld/tree/master/demo/public
[00:13] tiglionabbit: mikeal: no
[00:13] tiglionabbit: I am talking about shadowing here
[00:14] mikeal: oh, that's because it hacks in lexical scoping
[00:14] cagdas: hi guys, anyone successful to compile nodejs in Amazon micro instance?
[00:14] Marak: tiglionabbit: https://github.com/hij1nx/weld/blob/master/demo/public/js/index.js
[00:14] mikeal: which is the single most useful things it does
[00:14] Marak: cagdas: im sure yeah
[00:14] cagdas: by default settings it fails when I try
[00:14] maushu: CANDY? WHERE?!

[00:16] squaretone: jade is removing all the whitespace from my html. when i view source it is all run together. nice for production; annoying for dev. any way to turn it off?
[00:16] ChrisPartridge: cagdas: got all the build deps?
[00:16] tiglionabbit: Marak: how do I make it add something to the page that wasn't there before, in response to a user action?
[00:16] cagdas: yes
[00:16] davidbanham has joined the channel
[00:17] cagdas: it works with small instance
[00:17] ChrisPartridge: cagdas: well what error are you getting?
[00:17] cagdas: but fails with micro instance
[00:17] tiglionabbit: mikeal: my favorite thing about coffeescript is ->
[00:17] mikeal: i don't care about syntax
[00:18] tiglionabbit: mikeal: if I could rename the 'function' keyword in javascript to something short like -> I would be happy.
[00:18] cagdas: ChrisPartridge: let me try
[00:18] tjholowaychuk: tiglionabbit then dont type it
[00:18] aberry has left the channel
[00:18] tjholowaychuk: type "f" and have your editor complete it
[00:18] mikeal: just type function, move along, write an app, get over it :)
[00:18] zitchie has joined the channel
[00:18] tjholowaychuk: yeah haha typing is not your bottleneck
[00:19] Marak: tiglionabbit: you gotta RTFM, weld is an anti-templating engine, its prob much diffirent from anything you've done
[00:19] Marak: tiglionabbit: its pretty gangster actually, i gotta start using it
[00:19] tiglionabbit: oh also, I really like how, if you make an object on multiple lines, you don't have to put commas.  No more IE "you can't have an extra comma" error.  Oh and it does === by default, which is what you pretty much always really mean.  etc.
[00:19] Marak: tiglionabbit: if you join #nodejitsu , hijinx is there everyday, he can help you get a demo going
[00:19] tiglionabbit: Marak: I read the manual, but there is no demonstration of doing this at runtime
[00:20] tiglionabbit: so I don't get it
[00:20] alex___ has joined the channel
[00:20] Marak: tiglionabbit: what is runtime?
[00:20] tiglionabbit: also i still don't see how I'm supposed to get access to the same templates on the client side and the server side
[00:20] tiglionabbit: Marak: in response to users doing stuff
[00:20] Marak: tiglionabbit: what is "users doing stuff"
[00:20] tiglionabbit: Marak: Idk, maybe they clicked on something and I want to add a block of html to the page
[00:21] Marak: tiglionabbit: weld(document.querySelector('.templateRow'), data.games); 
[00:21] tiglionabbit: in mustache I'd use a partial template and insert it
[00:21] Marak: $('button').click(function(){weld(document.querySelector('.templateRow'), data.games); });
[00:21] tiglionabbit: where am I getting that templateRow from?
[00:21] tiglionabbit: is it a hidden node in the document somewhere?
[00:21] Marak: its a html fragment in your document
[00:21] Marak: maybe hidden, maybe not
[00:21] Marak: should prob not be hidden
[00:22] Marak: since the parent dom node you start with should be visible
[00:22] tiglionabbit: why would I have a visible template in the page? :P
[00:22] alex___: hey all - does anyone know a good way to make their calls go AJAX when using the express framework ?  I'm trying to set  -  app.set('view options', {layout: false});  but that seems to affect subsequent requests as well  
[00:22] Marak: tiglionabbit: stop thinking about templates
[00:22] Marak: tiglionabbit: weld is template anti-matter
[00:22] tiglionabbit: Marak: I don't see how this is usable
[00:22] Marak: tiglionabbit: think about the actual problem you are trying to solve, not what templates do
[00:22] tjholowaychuk: alex___: res.partial(), or res.render(view, { layout: false })
[00:22] tiglionabbit: alek___: pretty sure you can pass it in
[00:22] Marak: tiglionabbit: well, thats because you dont understand it, traditional templating is a hard paradigm to break from
[00:22] tiglionabbit: what he said
[00:23] Marak: tiglionabbit: weld takes your dom and welds data to it
[00:23] tokumine has joined the channel
[00:23] tiglionabbit: Marak: ok.  I have a list of things.  Maybe there are no things in the list yet.  A user clicks a button.  Now I want to add a thing to the list.  Normally, I'd have a template for that thing.
[00:23] Marak: so you have a <ul>
[00:23] alex___: oh - yes - I think i might have a way I can do that elegantly then
[00:23] alex___: i' try it 
[00:24] Marak: and you have one <li> inside of it that is your "template"
[00:24] newy_ has joined the channel
[00:24] Marak: you weld your data on the the <ul><li>
[00:24] Marak: ill get some better examples up on there in the next few days
[00:24] tiglionabbit: Marak: lets add a requirement here.  Each item in the list is full of fiddly bits that the user can mess around with.  When I add a new thing to the list, I don't wanna mess up any of the existing things.
[00:24] jeromegn has joined the channel
[00:25] Marak: tiglionabbit: weld should be really smart about that, and do diffirential updates that wont affect anything they shouldnt
[00:25] Marak: tiglionabbit: i wish i could give you some better concrete examples but i havent had a chance to build anything with it yet, just been around for most of the projects planning and discussing how it works with creators
[00:26] Marak: the concept is super solid though, and the authors are solid too
[00:26] Marak: has tests and the api looks about right
[00:26] tiglionabbit: Marak: after you render things the first time, wouldn't it obliterate your template?  How can you render again after that?
[00:26] Marak: tiglionabbit: it should take care of all that for you, its not a templating engine
[00:26] Marak: its template anti-matter
[00:26] tiglionabbit: Marak: you'll have to show me a proof of concept then
[00:27] tjholowaychuk: tiglionabbit i assume you could leave an untouched hidden element
[00:27] tiglionabbit: anyway, this all sort of dances around my real problem: how do I put templates somewhere that both the client and server can see them
[00:27] tjholowaychuk: for your template
[00:27] Marak: tiglionabbit: i dont have to show you anything, weld is fucking awesome
[00:27] jtsnow has joined the channel
[00:27] jmoyers: haha
[00:27] Marak: tiglionabbit: ill add better examples to the project, but its up to you to figure it out
[00:27] Marak: :-)
[00:27] tiglionabbit: Marak: sorry :P I'm just not convinced
[00:27] jmoyers: marak: do you know how weld handles discrete data getting added?
[00:27] Marak: fair enough
[00:27] jmoyers: meaning your model is a collection
[00:27] jmoyers: a collection of todo items lets say
[00:27] Marak: jmoyers: one sec
[00:28] jmoyers: so in theory you have to add an item to the dom, not just replace content
[00:28] fljitovak has joined the channel
[00:29] Marak: jmoyers: the tests seem pretty literate to read https://github.com/hij1nx/weld/blob/master/test/test.js
[00:29] tiglionabbit: so, do any of you guys actually use the same templates on the server side and the client side?
[00:29] jmoyers: k let me check this out
[00:30] jmoyers: oh
[00:30] jmoyers: its using templating
[00:30] jmoyers: got it
[00:30] jmoyers: but its just jquery
[00:30] Marak: im going to summon hijinx if i can
[00:30] Marak: jmoyers: i dont think jquery is a requirement
[00:30] jmoyers: no its not, i get that
[00:30] jerrysv: marak: it was in the beginning
[00:30] jmoyers: its loosely coupled
[00:30] jmoyers: with this callback
[00:30] jmoyers: https://github.com/hij1nx/weld/blob/master/test/test.js#L11-13
[00:31] jmoyers: you can put whatever you want in there

[00:35] sorens3n: ah gotcha

[00:36] Mrfloyd has joined the channel
[00:36] tjholowaychuk: best to start with the low level apis

[00:36] Marak: tjholowaychuk: ill be honest, early versions of express made me very wary
[00:36] itsTodd: different Todd
[00:36] Marak: tjholowaychuk: but i hear its mountains better now
[00:36] Marak: tjholowaychuk: all new shit
[00:36] tjholowaychuk: Marak: early versions of anything node sucked
[00:36] tjholowaychuk: including node
[00:36] tjholowaychuk: lol
[00:37] tjholowaychuk: hense funky weird non-node abstractions
[00:37] Marak: tjholowaychuk: you dont like 3 nested async calls to read a file into memory? what are you stupid?
[00:37] zebra has left the channel
[00:37] Marak: i think the express use to not use require() since it was soo early
[00:38] Marak: tjholowaychuk: that was a joke btw >.<, of course 3 nested async calls suck
[00:38] tjholowaychuk: yeah i started express with like... node v0.0.3 or something stupid
[00:38] tjholowaychuk: keeping up with api changes was a bitch
[00:38] tjholowaychuk: so i abstracted a lot
[00:38] tjholowaychuk: which ended up being bad of course
[00:38] tjholowaychuk: in the long run
[00:38] Marak: makes sense

[00:39] justinw312: jerrysv: I guess the biggest problem is there would be a lot of events that would have to complete in a given order. So node.js might not be the ideal solution. You can't return the value on someone's something before the DB lookup returns. I was thinking a task queue where some callbacks (db lookups) would cause the queue to wait. 
[00:40] Marak: justinw312: have you seen async.js ?
[00:40] Marak: justinw312: https://github.com/caolan/async
[00:41] justinw312: Also, I sort of hate to do something that websockets would be so perfect for, without websockets, this close to them becoming a reality
[00:41] jerrysv: justinw312: "back in the day" we had a giant event loop, just fired off events when things were ready, equivalent of a setTimeout()
[00:41] justinw312: marak: No, I haven't. Let me look at it.

[06:22] mikeal has joined the channel
[06:22] kiyoto: Hey I have a question about scoping of 'this' in node.js
[06:23] kiyoto: this.a = 10; var f = function(){console.log(this.a);};
[06:23] kiyoto: what should f() print?
[06:24] cloudhead2: kiyoto: functions introduce new scopes
[06:24] broofa has joined the channel
[06:26] kiyoto: cloudhead2: I thought 'this' was bound to the object if it is a field, to whatever object if invoked through call/apply, and to the function itself if it is called with 'new', and else it is the global scope.
[06:26] kiyoto: at least that's how it is on the client side JS...
[06:26] cloudhead2: pretty much, yea
[06:27] ardcore has joined the channel
[06:27] cloudhead2: javascript is still javascript in node
[06:27] Draggor has joined the channel
[06:27] kiyoto: cloudhead2: if that's the case, why does f() print 'undefined' in node.js in the previous example
[06:28] kiyoto: shouldn't it print '10'?
[06:28] cloudhead2: no you'd have to do this.f = function(){} for that
[06:29] criswell has joined the channel
[06:29] kiyoto: cloudhead2: why? 'this' is not a global scope?
[06:30] kiyoto: cloudhead2: you agree that in the browser, the same code would return '10' as opposed to 'undefined', right?
[06:30] seivan has joined the channel
[06:30] cloudhead2: kiyoto: yea, I think the difference is the evaluation context
[06:31] cloudhead2: in the browser it's "window"
[06:31] matjas has joined the channel
[06:31] kiyoto: cloudhead2: and in node...?
[06:32] cloudhead2: well, it depends
[06:32] cloudhead2: if you're in a module, it's module.exports
[06:32] `3rdEden has joined the channel
[06:32] ivanfi has joined the channel
[06:32] briznad has joined the channel
[06:32] cloudhead2: if you're not in a module, I'm not sure
[06:33] kiyoto: cloudhead2: is this documented in the docs?
[06:33] cloudhead2: I think it's also module.exports actually
[06:33] cloudhead2: some of it
[06:33] cloudhead2: not in great detail
[06:34] kiyoto: okay
[06:34] kiyoto: so in a file, if i type this.f = function(){}; var f = function(){}; are the two f's different?
[06:35] kiyoto: oh i see i see
[06:35] kiyoto: finally seeing the difference...
[06:35] cloudhead2: yes
[06:36] kiyoto: so only the stuff in 'this' namespace gets exported
[06:36] springify has joined the channel
[06:36] cloudhead2: because `this.a` is module.exports.a, and `a` is just a local var
[06:36] cloudhead2: yea
[06:37] kiyoto: alright i got mega confused reading Socket.IO source code because i come from client side JS...
[06:37] cloudhead2: because code in node gets wrapped in an anonymous function
[06:37] kiyoto: cloudehead2: can you elaborate on that?
[06:37] cloudhead2: when you require a module
[06:37] cloudhead2: it wraps it in a closure
[06:37] cloudhead2: it doesnt evaluate it in the global scope
[06:38] kiyoto: and just returns 'this'
[06:38] cloudhead2: it does (function(require, module, ...) { ... your code...  })()
[06:38] `3rdEden: No, this is still global
[06:39] cloudhead2: it returns whatever you attached on `this`
[06:40] kiyoto: cloudhead2:thx for clarifying that
[06:40] cloudhead2: you should never be using or seeing `this` used inside a function assigned to a local var, though
[06:41] cloudhead2: cause that's just confusing
[06:41] kiyoto: cloudhead2: yea that was just playing around 
[06:41] cloudhead2: ok

[07:13] creationix: then I'll have a single module with three classes in in
[07:13] chapel: yeah
[07:13] chapel: that help?
[07:14] creationix: so, there will be a lot of wrapping and unwrapping going on
[07:14] creationix: in my case, there is one main class, the the other two are types that are sometimes used as return types or arguments
[07:15] creationix: so, for example ClassA has method foo that returns an instance of ClassB which is an argument to Class.bar
[07:15] creationix: I also have pquerna's article on async.  https://www.cloudkick.com/blog/2010/aug/23/writing-nodejs-native-extensions/
[07:15] creationix: hopefully it's still up to date
[07:16] chapel: its fairly accurate
[07:16] chapel: there is also isaacs example
[07:16] `3rdEden: notasysadmin thats a bit relative to the server you are hosting it on..
[07:17] chapel: creationix: its not class based, but its async https://github.com/isaacs/node-async-simple/blob/master/nas.cc
[07:17] `3rdEden: as 128mb server will accept allot less connections than a 64gb server
[07:18] creationix: I guess it doesn't matter how the underlying C++ library is written since you're wrapping it
[07:18] notasysadmin: `3rdEden: Let's say a 4GB server then. I'm concerned it'd (at some point) be limited by open TCP port numbers... to 64k or some such
[07:18] creationix: now if only I can get my wscript to work right

[08:04] foobarfighter: imo*

[08:04] justinTNT: I think, when it suits, it looks tidy.
[08:04] foobarfighter: right on
[08:04] creationix: actually, mine aren't usually classes, but often just a function
[08:05] creationix: like Stack or Step

[08:19] chapel: awesome
[08:19] chapel: glad you made progress

[08:19] chapel: I mean, what is good about it?
[08:19] pyrony has joined the channel
[08:20] uchuff has joined the channel
[08:20] creationix: It's a great base for implementing databases
[08:20] XYXing: hey, guys, in javascript, there is no 'hash', even Array can use object as keys, but Array methods can not support this kind of element
[08:20] creationix: on it's own it's a pretty good persistent key/value store
[08:20] chapel: cool
[08:20] XYXing: for browsers, there is Prototype.js to provide Hash class
[08:20] XYXing: how about nodeJS ???
[08:21] creationix: chapel: it was written as the underpinnings for indexdb in chrome
[08:21] jesusabdullah: XYXing: try https://github.com/substack/node-hashish
[08:21] chapel: oh cool
[08:21] creationix: XYXing: what would the hash do that normal Objects can't do?
[08:21] criswell has joined the channel
[08:21] chapel: someone wanted an indexdb thing in node
[08:21] vikstrous has joined the channel
[08:21] XYXing: for example
[08:22] XYXing: the length
[08:22] creationix: XYXing: I see, that's not hard to add at all
[08:22] creationix: Object.keys(obj).length is the length of obj
[08:22] XYXing: and
[08:22] vikstrous: guys, is there something for node that takes a bunch of images in a folder and compiles them into sprites with the associated css?
[08:22] creationix: you could easily monkey patch Object.prototype or replace obj__proto__ with a sub-object of Object.prototype
[08:22] XYXing: if  u wnat  to 'pop' thing form the 'end''
[08:23] XYXing: where is the 'end '
[08:23] XYXing: i mean, objects has no index right
[08:23] creationix: well, there is the keys array
[08:23] XYXing: and Object.keys(obj).length
[08:23] XYXing: will contain
[08:23] jesusabdullah: creationix: I know that hashish basically just wrapps regular objects and adds functionality and convenience stuffs
[08:23] XYXing: some framwork defined propertis
[08:23] jesusabdullah: creationix: Just because you *can* do something with something doesn't mean you can't make it easier
[08:23] nanicoar has joined the channel

[08:24] jesusabdullah: That said, I suspect I would hate prototype
[08:24] vlapan has joined the channel
[08:24] creationix: XYXing: no it won't, Object.keys only grabs own properties and only enumerable ones
[08:24] creationix: XYXing: Object.getOwnPropertyNames will get all the own props enumerable or not
[08:24] q_no has joined the channel
[08:24] creationix: jesusabdullah: not arguing, I've written and published a couple hash libraries
[08:25] XYXing: ok, so how do we perform 'dequeue' from object ?
[08:25] creationix: https://github.com/creationix/pattern/blob/master/lib/pattern/hash.js is my latest
[08:25] creationix: XYXing: get the last key in Object.keys and delete it from the object
[08:25] XYXing: so
[08:25] XYXing: Hashish is useless ?
[08:25] creationix: useless, no
[08:26] creationix: any library isn't required if you're willing to do the work by hand
[08:26] creationix: and a good library could do nice things like cache the Object.keys lookups to increase performance or something
[08:26] XYXing: yes, i agree
[08:26] creationix: though it is pretty fast in V8
[08:27] creationix: Object.keys in particular is *really* fast
[08:27] __tosh has joined the channel
[08:27] XYXing: ok, thank u ~
[08:27] jesusabdullah: hashish is handy, in my experience. But, if it's trivial to do it with regular objects you might as well
[08:27] jesusabdullah: Listen to creationix.
[08:27] jesusabdullah: He knows what's up.
[08:27] creationix: I also have NIH syndrome
[08:27] jesusabdullah: Speaking of: creationix you bastard where've you been??
[08:27] jesusabdullah: ^5
[08:28] creationix: jesusabdullah: working on webOS
[08:28] creationix: we have a big release very soon
[08:28] jesusabdullah: Cool!
[08:28] jesusabdullah: Sweet
[08:28] creationix: node on tablets
[08:28] pyrotechnick: since when isnt node on tablets
[08:28] jesusabdullah: since forever obviously
[08:28] jesusabdullah: well
[08:28] chapel: lol
[08:28] jesusabdullah: this would be webOS tablets
[08:29] chapel: I like the idea of webos, but prefer android
[08:29] creationix: http://www.palm.com/us/products/pads/touchpad/index.html
[08:29] jesusabdullah: I haven't had a chance to play with either one(s) really
[08:29] chapel: even node can't make me switch
[08:29] creationix: I played with the new Samsung 10" tablet yesterday
[08:29] creationix: the hardware is really nice, but the interface felt clunky
[08:29] XYXing: but what if
[08:29] jesusabdullah: I wouldn't pick a phone (or tablet) based on the development environment, but I *would* pick one based on the available apps
[08:29] chapel: ACTION isn't into tablets either
[08:29] creationix: and anything web-based was really slow
[08:30] tobiassjosten has joined the channel
[08:30] XYXing: I augment some properties to Array
[08:30] chapel: I love my nexus one
[08:30] creationix: jesusabdullah: well a good dev environment means better apps eventually
[08:30] XYXing: and then i have an Array object
[08:30] creationix: it's just still too new
[08:30] XYXing: and I put some items in it as key-value pairs
[08:30] jesusabdullah: creationix: indeed. Moreover, I know enough node.js that I could probably finagle an app together if I wanted it
[08:30] jesusabdullah: At least, for smaller ones
[08:30] XYXing: then Object.keys( obj ).length
[08:30] jesusabdullah: tbh games aren't a big deal to me
[08:31] XYXing: the extra length appears
[08:31] creationix: XYXing: code?
[08:31] XYXing: of course, because there are some slef-defined properties
[08:31] creationix: XYXing: I promise that Object.keys only grabs own enumarable keys
[08:31] chapel: yeah, idk, I guess I will just have to keep looking, and if its super awesome in webos land, I do like to hack up my own toys/tools
[08:32] creationix: webOS isn't there yet, but it's getting better real fast
[08:32] creationix: and HP is pumping out the new hardware soon
[08:33] jesusabdullah: I'll keep my eyes out. I'll actually probably want to get a smartphone sometime in the next few months if I can afford it

[08:34] chapel: damn
[08:34] chapel: that sucks
[08:34] XYXing: here there are some self-defined methods to augment the Array type
[08:34] jesusabdullah: Yeah
[08:34] XYXing: title:question 1
[08:34] XYXing: and then
[08:34] chapel: hey creationix, could the way webos makes apps be done on other platforms, or at least android?
[08:34] chapel: as far as node.js
[08:35] bzinger has joined the channel
[08:35] chapel: so then you could make one app, and have work at least partially elsewhere?
[08:35] creationix: chapel: the front-end can be done with phonegap
[08:35] creationix: the node stuff is pretty webos specific
[08:35] ardcore has left the channel
[08:35] chapel: like the whole api?

[08:37] creationix: jesusabdullah: for what? node or webOS
[08:37] jesusabdullah: webOS
[08:37] jesusabdullah: in particular
[08:37] creationix: there is dropbear and openssh for webOS
[08:38] creationix: it's just linux and you get root access
[08:38] creationix: there is even X11 and xterm
[08:38] creationix: just not in the normal catalog
[08:38] jesusabdullah: hmmmm
[08:38] slaskis: i want to play with a webos device, anyone knows if they work in europe?
[08:38] chapel: jesusabdullah: android is linux too
[08:38] jesusabdullah: I know that, in node, ssh bindings are an open problem
[08:39] jesusabdullah: chapel: Yeah, I know. I remember the ssh client I used with android being sub-par though

[08:39] JackeyChan: the code like that :

[08:39] chapel: listen to podcasts

[08:39] JackeyChan:   this.action = {};

[08:40] creationix: android may be linux, but it's locked down
[08:40] jesusabdullah: JackeyChan: THEN link us to the gist/pastie/whatev and ask "wtf"

[08:40] jesusabdullah: orly?
[08:40] jesusabdullah: Man, this might be an HP device I actually like!
[08:41] chapel: well I have google android phone, so I just change a setting and I have root
[08:41] creationix: you just install the sdk on your laptop and enable developer mode on the phone
[08:41] chapel: the way its meant to be
[08:41] creationix: and you can og right in
[08:41] JackeyChan: ok. thanks your suggestion
[08:41] chapel: creationix: its locked down by 3rd parties
[08:41] chapel: hp owns webos and hp phones
[08:41] chapel: :P
[08:41] creationix: chapel: really? I have a stock nexus one
[08:41] creationix: chapel: how do I get root?
[08:42] chapel: hook it up to a computer, use the android sdk, and type a command
[08:42] creationix: fair enough
[08:42] chapel: might be harder than webos
[08:43] chapel: but its not blocked on nexus one
[08:43] chapel: not sure about nexus s
[08:43] chapel: I believe its open as well, but I could be wrong
[08:43] creationix: anyway, back to node-leveldb.  Once I go to bed, it's back to working on webos in the morning

[08:45] chapel: are you guys keeping up with node's api changes?
[08:45] creationix: but leveldb could make a cool base for a service
[08:46] chapel: yeah
[08:46] creationix: chapel: we're still chipping node v0.2.x, but all the code works on 0.4.x as well.
[08:46] creationix: *shipping
[08:46] chapel: cool
[08:46] chapel: though too bad
[08:47] jesusabdullah: I'm totally running express on my phone
[08:47] jesusabdullah: ^__^
[08:47] creationix: chapel: let's face it. it's amazing that carriers are letting us put something like node on a phone in the first place
[08:47] creationix: qa cycles will make it constantly a little behind
[08:47] JackeyChan: https://gist.github.com/980417. this the issue code that i made. the method of on() and emit()can not work. can you help me ??

[09:08] pyrotechnick: last time i checked it was 4
[09:08] pyrotechnick: but its been steadily increasing
[09:09] jesusabdullah: It's gone up ridiculously this last week
[09:09] jesusabdullah: I know that
[09:09] LacKac: JackeyChan: as I've seen so far most libraries write their own implementation for this
[09:09] pyrotechnick: yeah because of a difficulty increase
[09:09] mscdex: JackeyChan: like util.inherits() ?
[09:09] LacKac: JackeyChan: but you could use underscore if you want this and other cool functional programming helpers
[09:09] mscdex: oh wait extends

[09:14] chapel: 10k machines at 100%, yeah, not worth it
[09:15] prettyrobots: BitCoin: What is the opposite of green?
[09:15] chapel: 10k machines = like 40Gh/s
[09:15] prettyrobots: A great way to convert our energy dependency back into currency.
[09:15] chapel: if you get like 4kh/s per machine
[09:15] Marak: lol
[09:15] nexxy: bitcoins!
[09:16] nexxy: the currency that's created from thin air by wasting electricity!!
[09:16] nexxy: how exciting
[09:16] chapel: Marak: one gpu can get 300Mh/s
[09:16] prettyrobots: Seriously, how did this become a thing?
[09:16] gqlewis has joined the channel
[09:17] pyrotechnick: it's not really about generating them from thin air it's about POW, they could have folded proteins or SETI instead
[09:17] chapel: so one gpu is worth like 75 of your machines
[09:17] prettyrobots: Can anyone here say, oh, I love them because of X.
[09:17] mscdex: they could have folded aliens
[09:17] pyrotechnick: they could have
[09:17] prettyrobots: pyrotechnick: What does POW stand for?
[09:17] pyrotechnick: i love them because they're not at the mercy of central banks
[09:17] pyrotechnick: proof of work
[09:17] pomodoro has joined the channel
[09:18] prettyrobots: Ah.
[09:18] pyrotechnick: im working on a proposal that will fold proteins instead
[09:18] mscdex: but bitcoin isn't backed by a bank that guarantees your money?
[09:18] prettyrobots: Ah.
[09:18] prettyrobots: pyrotechnick: That would be awesome.
[09:18] pyrotechnick: it would also give alot more incentive to mine
[09:18] prettyrobots: I'd suddenly really like the idea.
[09:18] pyrotechnick: especially for academics/nice people
[09:19] pyrotechnick: its not just a money-grab then
[09:19] mscdex: seems like your collection of bitcoins could becoming worthless just like that
[09:19] mscdex: s/becoming/become/
[09:19] pyrotechnick: yeah it could
[09:19] prettyrobots: Yeah, the whole thing is so sleezy.
[09:19] nexxy: once bitcoin becomes popular enough
[09:19] mscdex: that's not very reassuring :p
[09:19] chapel: pyrotechnick: the problem is difficulty
[09:19] prettyrobots: Without really appearing to be valuable.
[09:19] nexxy: it will be seized and manipulated
[09:19] nexxy: like every other currency
[09:20] chapel: the reason bitcoins work (in principle) is that it becomes harder to mine them
[09:20] pyrotechnick: most people think the value of bitcoins is backed by floating point operations
[09:20] pyrotechnick: that's not the case
[09:20] nexxy: chapel, is that why fossil fuels work? ;3
[09:20] prettyrobots: Wow. You all are really thinking about this.
[09:20] Swizec has joined the channel
[09:20] nexxy: oh wait
[09:20] chapel: the value of bitcoin is very much based on trade
[09:20] pyrotechnick: kinda
[09:20] chapel: lol nexxy
[09:20] nexxy: and then
[09:20] pyrotechnick: the value of bitcoins is backed by how much more incentive people have to use bitcoins than the contending virtual currencies
[09:20] chjj: deep economic discussion on bit coins
[09:20] nexxy: a few people that were in it from the beginning
[09:20] nexxy: will realize
[09:20] nexxy: that they can collude w/ each other
[09:21] nexxy: and modify their consensus together
[09:21] mscdex: i wonder if bitcoins will catch on as a currency just like swatch time caught on as a popular measure of time
[09:21] nexxy: just liek the federal reserve!
[09:21] mscdex: :p
[09:21] thalll has joined the channel
[09:22] chapel: pyrotechnick: but Im not talking about value entirely, talking about long term, making it more difficult simulated scarcity, without scarcity, there is no inherent value down the line, if you can keep printing money indefinitely, money becomes worthless
[09:22] pyrotechnick: chapel: correct, for now
[09:22] prettyrobots: mscdex: I can't tell who's joking here and you're not helping.
[09:22] chapel: bitcoin isn't the first virtual currency
[09:22] chapel: and it wont be the last
[09:22] mscdex: heh
[09:22] nexxy: money doesn't become worthless by printing more indefinitely
[09:22] Murugaratham has joined the channel
[09:22] pyrotechnick: until there's a currency that provides more incentive to use, at which point bitcoins begin their decent towards being worth nothing
[09:22] nexxy: money becomes worthless when we all realize it ;o
[09:22] nexxy: we will never realize it
[09:23] mscdex: node.js rules!
[09:23] chapel: nexxy: yes it does, but the goverment can enforce the value artificually
[09:23] chapel: bah at typos
[09:23] chjj: ACTION needs more webscale
[09:23] pyrotechnick: i think if you can back the currency by something that does more than just consume electricity
[09:23] nexxy: mhmm

[09:23] mscdex: ACTION needs more hours of sleep

[09:23] nexxy: pyrotechnick, yeah! like something... something that adds flavor to food?
[09:24] nexxy: I know!!
[09:24] nexxy: salt!
[09:24] pyrotechnick: MSG
[09:24] prettyrobots: Folded proteins as POW gets me excited about it.
[09:24] nexxy: wow
[09:24] nexxy: apparently msg gets pyrotechnick excitd
[09:24] mscdex: make sure you fold your protiens neatly
[09:24] chapel: pyrotechnick: the scarcity is what makes people want to trade in it, because they know that eventually, only people with huge investment in mining them will be able to make them, the rest of the market will just be what is out there
[09:25] chapel: if you can make folding proteins more difficult
[09:25] nexxy: spray starch?
[09:25] chapel: or make it so the payout is less

[09:26] chjj: exactly
[09:26] mscdex: so who wrote the multiplayer scorched earth game in node?
[09:26] asabil has joined the channel
[09:26] pyrotechnick: there are many, relatively, predictable "tiers" of proteins in terms of the computation needed to fold them
[09:27] prettyrobots: chapel: I don't mean that you're not critical, but that you're giving it your consideration.
[09:27] prettyrobots: Generally, when people talk about Internet currencies, I tune them out.
[09:27] chapel: ah
[09:27] chapel: Im just curious how legitimate it can become
[09:27] nexxy: prettyrobots, you know you're crazy for linden
[09:28] chapel: and I always enjoyed folding at home
[09:28] prettyrobots: Because, in the last 15 years, whenever anyone walked up to me in the coffee shop and said, hey, you look like you know about computers, I've got this idea...
[09:28] chjj: lets start our own internet currency, measured in units of webscale
[09:28] chjj: ACTION needs 3 more webscale
[09:28] prettyrobots: Their idea was always micro-payments.
[09:28] chapel: micropayments !== digital currency
[09:29] nexxy: can we just start using the tabs from soda cans as a currency?
[09:29] nexxy: I'd be rich ;3
[09:29] prettyrobots: chapel: Same vein.
[09:29] chapel: sure
[09:30] prettyrobots: Same sort of.... I mean, captures the imagination of those that don't know better.
[09:30] chapel: pyrotechnick: why scarcity is important, almost all currency used to be based on something valuable and rare already, like gold
[09:30] prettyrobots: nexxy: Yeah, Linden was the last incarnation of this that got press.
[09:30] nexxy: ACTION devises a currency based on love
[09:30] chapel: but now, at least the usd, it is based on the word of our government
[09:30] nexxy: it's both valuable... and rare!

[09:31] nexxy: lol
[09:31] nexxy: they will show you
[09:31] chapel: nexxy: well, its the us gov that backs it, its the fed reserve that prints it
[09:31] chjj: no imean, if love is currency, you cant sell love for love, doesnt work
[09:31] pyrotechnick: the us government IS the federal reserve
[09:31] nexxy: no john, you are the demons
[09:31] prettyrobots: chjj: Ask Cole Porter.
[09:31] pyrotechnick: havent you seen zeitgeist 
[09:32] chapel: pyrotechnick: nope
[09:32] pyrotechnick: i suggest not seeing it
[09:32] prettyrobots: chjj: Also, you can't convert it to other currencies, according to the Beatles.
[09:32] nexxy: chjj, there are different kinds of love
[09:32] nexxy: you could trade one kind for another

[12:18] `3rdEden: LacKac yes we used it in production in our prev. deployment
[12:18] `3rdEden: LacKac just because the version number is low doesn't directly indicate it's unstable ;)
[12:19] MrTopf has joined the channel
[12:19] LacKac: `3rdEden: that was my experience as well
[12:19] `3rdEden: That it was unstable?
[12:19] LacKac: no

[12:20] LacKac: i started integrating it but then I switched to another one (elbart/node-memcache)
[12:21] `3rdEden: If you don't me asking, why did you switch?
[12:21] LacKac: it feeled simpler but still doing everything we needed
[12:21] `3rdEden: ah
[12:21] LacKac: but now I have some problems with that one
[12:21] `3rdEden: Yeh it's simpler, but that because it only supports one server
[12:21] LacKac: namely: it keeps the connection open and that hangs our processes
[12:21] `3rdEden: and the whole deal with memcached is that yhou can use memory from multiple servers :)
[12:21] LacKac: one server is enough for us
[12:22] `3rdEden: Untill you hit the front-page of digg :p
[12:22] LacKac: we're using membase with moxi in front of it
[12:22] `3rdEden: ah
[12:23] matjas has joined the channel
[12:23] jano has joined the channel
[12:24] LacKac: anyway, I think I'll switch back :)

[12:28] `3rdEden: there 2 in npm

[13:42] ryankirkman has joined the channel
[13:43] sorens3n: the way you put this code just doesn't make much sence imo

[13:46] sorens3n: and might be wrong
[13:47] F1LT3R has joined the channel
[13:47] sorens3n: it seems to me that you would have a higher level order of things that includes both r1 and r2 and then uses them

[13:48] sorens3n: i might be retarded
[13:48] sorens3n: :D

[13:51] Corren has joined the channel
[13:52] seemann: If I require script 1, it will give me an empty object
[13:52] sorens3n: theres no reason not to require it, but why export it directly
[13:52] seemann: say that again?
[13:52] sorens3n: well, what exactly are you exporting
[13:52] sorens3n: if r1 is already exported, why is r2 re-exporting it
[13:53] seemann: no no, they are not exporting the same thing
[13:53] sorens3n: and if they both require each other, it seems you are making a dependancy issue
[13:53] sorens3n: a needs b, but b needs a?
[13:53] seemann: a needs a function from b and b needs a function from a
[13:53] sorens3n: how would they ever figure out which is what, which is probably why only one actually outputs what you expect

[13:54] sorens3n: with C!
[13:54] seemann: didnt work
[13:54] sorens3n: c for 'common
[13:55] seemann: hehehe
[13:55] seemann: u know a crazy thing?
[13:55] sorens3n: most packages dont rely on a package that relies on the package including it
[13:55] seemann: if i dont use module.exports
[13:55] seemann: but simply exports.r1 and exports r2
[13:55] seemann: things work fine
[13:56] sorens3n: yeah i do have some strange troubles with module.exports now and then, i've seen it done a few different ways, and generally defer to the code at the top of backbone.js 
[13:56] sorens3n: since i use it so much
[13:56] nibblebot has joined the channel
[13:56] sorens3n: which is a slightly different paradigm, of using it on server / client

[13:58] sorens3n: in which case both classes and students should be defined, and a controller decides what to do with them

[13:59] sorens3n: not that a class decides what to do with a student that also decides what to do with a class
[13:59] sorens3n: its an infinate loop 
[13:59] seemann: i'll redifine those things then, tyvm

[14:38] sorens3n: we're not to the point of bringing in DB's in this case though
[14:38] bingomanatee: You can have any number of nondeterministic joins with a join constrct that has typeA: string, idA: int, typeB: string, joinB: int, but you'll end up with Drupal and your logic gets tortured. 
[14:38] sorens3n: you are going beyond the paradigm
[14:38] bingomanatee: I tend to
[14:38] bingomanatee: what is the use case?
[14:38] sorens3n: exactly
[14:38] sorens3n: his use case was that a function A required B which required A
[14:39] sorens3n: and nothing more
[14:39] sorens3n: which is the flaw
[14:39] bingomanatee: ah. 
[14:39] sorens3n: of course it can be solved with a third party 
[14:39] sorens3n: which is why i suggested to bring in the abstract, C
[14:39] sorens3n: to control both A and B
[14:39] xandrews has joined the channel
[14:39] sorens3n: involving problems / solutions beyond that is just not relevant to his problem
[14:40] sorens3n: not that your not absolutely right in what you said
[14:40] bingomanatee: not really , module foo = module.exports = function(a, b, c){ var barred =  require('bar')(a, b, c); } .... and the converse 
[14:40] bingomanatee: You just have to figure out yourself how to avoid recursion. 
[14:41] robhawkes has joined the channel
[14:41] sorens3n: yep
[14:41] sorens3n: but you go further than the given problem
[14:41] bingomanatee: It is convention to require all modules in the global context - however it is not required and in this case, not useful.

[15:46] tjholowaychuk: you could, but that's not what it is
[15:46] tjholowaychuk: so it doesnt make any sense to me haha
[15:46] chjj: which is what real css variables are going to do anyway
[15:46] tjholowaychuk: other than having a little preview text editor
[15:46] tjholowaychuk: with css generating from less
[15:47] chjj: its not particularly useful, i just like theorycrafting about that

[15:48] supjeff: anybody know if css3 has a more comprehensible way of containing floated children?
[15:49] chjj: what do you mean?
[15:49] supjeff: overflow: hidden; makes no sense to me
[15:49] chjj: "containing"
[15:49] chjj: overflow: hidden creates a new block formatting context
[15:49] supjeff: and clearfix is a hack
[15:49] chjj: so margins actually bounce off the edge of the containg block
[15:49] supjeff: when you float all of an element's children, the element collapses completely
[15:50] chjj: yes, because the float element is still relative to the most ancestor BFC
[15:50] supjeff: that's almost never the desired outcome
[15:50] chjj: floated*
[15:50] supjeff: yeah, it makes sense
[15:50] chjj: "clearfix" is a horrible term
[15:50] seyz has joined the channel
[15:50] chjj: not even accurate

[15:51] tjholowaychuk: though i think it breaks in Ie
[15:51] tjholowaychuk: IE*
[15:51] chjj: overflow: hidden to create a new bfc, or i just dont use float to position everything
[15:51] tjholowaychuk: right now
[15:51] supjeff: what does bfc mean
[15:51] hsttlrjeff has left the channel
[15:51] zmbmartin: tjholowaychuk: is there something else I can use?
[15:52] chjj: absolute positioning is an amazingly underrated method of positioning, and its the only method that allows you to dynamically change the containing block of a box currently
[15:52] supjeff: lol
[15:52] chjj: try not to use float as the only way to position something, there might be a better way
[15:52] tjholowaychuk: i use absolute all the time
[15:52] tjholowaychuk: most the time actually

[15:53] tjholowaychuk: "absolute: top left"

[16:00] chjj: zmbmartin: the more elegant solution: dont support IE

[16:00] bingomanatee: I don't think you can do it in real time
[16:01] bingomanatee: but you can probably assign them after the fact.

[16:01] bingomanatee: https://github.com/bingomanatee/farmsworth-paradox
[16:02] zmbmartin: tjholowaychuk: yeah in jade when I try using mustache it complains about {{}}
[16:02] chjj: then your clients are the problem, the people using ie are the problem, the people using the horribly written intranet systems that depend on ie on the problem, the people writing those terrible systems are the problem, you might be able to keep tracing it back

[16:06] supjeff: ie6 was like 9 years

[16:06] AvianFlu: no pressure to improve your product
[16:06] halfhalo: nah, it finally clicked in MS's head that they need a web browser that was up to date/leading the pack with ie8, they pushed out ie9, and are already on ie10

[16:11] zmbmartin: tjholowaychuk: sorry I meant I am using handlebars and I was adding the template script to my jade template. I thought that was how I was suppose to do it. is add a script with type x-handlebars-tempalte

[16:11] tjholowaychuk: but things might conflict with jade's logic

[16:12] supjeff: I can code a site with no Handlebars
[16:12] supjeff: no handlebars
[16:12] tjholowaychuk: that's just what happens when people try to nest templates, to some degree the syntax will get in the way of the other

[17:38] chjj: ryankirkman: abstractions arent a good thing if you dont know whats happening beneath the surface
[17:38] deedubs has joined the channel
[17:39] chjj: MarkusT, the simplest way to do that by hand would be to nest the callbacks, and continue your code from there
[17:39] astropirate: ryankirkman: Excellent!
[17:39] chjj: not necessarily the fastest way though
[17:39] deedubs: This is a pretty funny ruby scalling tip https://twitter.com/rbates/status/71265407541051392
[17:39] ryankirkman: chjj: If I'm wrong, by all means correct me
[17:39] wadey: MarkusT: there is a library called "async" which provides helpers for doing what you asked
[17:39] chjj: youre not wrong, i just dont think thats good advice to someone who is new to node
[17:40] q_no has joined the channel
[17:40] chjj: to recommend immediately start using an abstraction without learning the basics first
[17:40] ryankirkman: Nesting callbacks is synchronous though, so doesn't that defeat the purpose of node?
[17:40] MarkusT: chjj: That would mean (in my understanding) that both request would be server after each other (synchronously). I'd love to avoid that, since I'm reading a lot more files than two and would like to do it async.
[17:40] drudge: i love vim
[17:40] ryankirkman: Additionally, it could make for some good reading
[17:40] chjj: its not synchronous, are you kidding?
[17:40] chjj: its serial
[17:40] rauchg has joined the channel
[17:40] baudehlo: tsesame_: yes, but it seems fs.watchFile fires every second after it has been fired once, with curr=prev
[17:40] chjj: like i said, its not the fastest way, but the simplest way to do by hand
[17:41] chjj: and no, its not synchronous
[17:41] ryankirkman: lol, my apologies (it is 4am)
[17:41] ryankirkman: I did mean serial
[17:41] chjj: yes, i made it clear that its not the fastest
[17:41] MarkusT: ryankirman: There's async and async.js. I guess you're referring to the first one?
[17:41] chjj: MarkusT: what you want is a paralell loop
[17:41] ryankirkman: MarkusT: As chjj said, it might be a good idea to understand what it is doing first
[17:42] ryankirkman: MarkusT: But I am specifically referring to https://github.com/caolan/async which is an  npm install -g async away
[17:42] mehsiu has joined the channel
[17:42] tsesame_: baudehlo: My understanding was that the check was done every second, and the callback is fired only if the file has been accessed since the last check.
[17:42] MarkusT: chjj: Sorry, meant serial. As I said: noob :-)
[17:42] Dandan has joined the channel
[17:42] baudehlo: well that's what happened when I tested it. YMMV?

[17:43] MarkusT: ryankirman: Thanks, will look into it. Very much appreciated.
[17:43] Dandan: is "Error: EACCES, Permission denied" a common error?
[17:43] Dandan: I installed on Ubuntu 10.x, using the copy in git
[17:43] Dandan: and make/make install
[17:44] telemachus: Dandan: if you're installing to /usr/local, you probably need make but  sudo make install
[17:44] MarkusT: ryankirman: Aah, now I get it. Found another async module first (after you hinted to "async" in general), which didn't have a parallel function. No it all makes sense. Thanks :-)
[17:44] telemachus: but maybe don't install to /usr/local?
[17:45] Dandan: telemachus: thanks, I forgot to mention I did use sudo make install
[17:45] chjj: MarkusT: yeah if youre reading big files, a serial loop could serve you better because you dont have to read everything into memory at once
[17:45] telemachus: See here http://blog.nodejs.org/2011/04/04/development-environment/
[17:45] Dandan: telemachus: if I run it with sudo it works fine
[17:45] telemachus: ah, whoops
[17:45] telemachus: nvm
[17:45] Dandan: telemachus: but that seems messed up.  If I install with sudo apt-get install nodejs, that works fine
[17:45] telemachus: which around here isn't clearly nevermind, lol
[17:45] Dandan: telemachus: but it seems to be an older version, and console.log won't work
[17:46] chjj: MarkusT: it all depends on what youre doing, always try to use parallel loops when they make sense, because theyre faster, but some situations will specifically call for a serial loop
[17:46] telemachus: Dandan: Right, APT tools will install a precompiled version of whatever is in your repos (which may be old - very old even)

[19:27] phil_: But at that point there's no connection.
[19:27] phil_: And it looks like the first event I have is "response", which is already too late.
[19:28] indutny: ryah: let me see
[19:28] indutny: ryah: yep, give me a 2 minutes
[19:29] indutny: ryah: rebase to what?
[19:29] indutny: 0.4 or master
[19:29] ryah: v0.4
[19:29] indutny: k
[19:29] chjj: phil_: that sets a timeout on the socket, what you could do is listen for the first data event, and set some closure variable to true, and then having a setTimeout that checks for the closured variables verity
[19:29] chjj: and destroy the request otherwise
[19:30] phil_: That's what I have been doing actually. I thought there was possibly a better way. haha
[19:30] phil_: Okay, well, thanks for the help!

[19:55] chjj: mraleph: not yet, going to release it soon, just want to make sure its faster than sizzle for the right reasons
[19:56] mraleph: try catch should not affect the perf of the callee much. 
[19:56] chjj: its just the function for the entire thing wrapped in a trycatch, i wrap it in a trycatch, and if somebody inputs something stupid, i just return an empty array

[19:59] mraleph: chjj: it might be that try catch affects the timing of the gc, cause entering function with try catch usually causes allocation of local context, this might cause gc that was otherwise happening in some other place. or something like that… or stack alignment, but stack alignment should not affect perf much.

[20:20] matbee: tsesame, same
[20:20] mikeal: i wrote python for a long time, there is plenty to dislike about it :)
[20:20] jmoyers: line numbers are indeed a pain
[20:20] jmoyers: def need to look at the 'compiled' code a bunch
[20:20] supjeff: mikeal: ... like what.
[20:20] ksmith: hey guys … I've just installed a few packages via npm and wondered why there's a folder ~/node_modules … is it safe to make it ~/.node_modules or even move it to /usr/local/... ?
[20:20] jmoyers: which luckily is not hard
[20:21] kersny has joined the channel
[20:21] supjeff: ksmith: you'd have to explicitly use the paths to your installed modules in your app
[20:21] jmoyers: ksmith: its supposed to install locall, so your packages are project specific
[20:21] jmoyers: you can use -g to install globally
[20:21] mikeal: threading is horrible, multiprocess is a joke, GIL, they broke that language and made the vm twice as slow so that print could be a function
[20:21] tprice has joined the channel
[20:21] mikeal: but mostly
[20:21] ksmith: well, I don't like them to be inside my home folder though
[20:22] ksmith: at least not as a visible folder
[20:22] mikeal: the python core community is not interested in what you are doing
[20:22] mikeal: they are working on a perfect syntax

[20:22] wadey: ksmith: you aren't support to run "npm install" from your home folder
[20:22] tsesame_: I don't know python that well, but I had thought they got multithreading right
[20:22] jmoyers: node is aware of the folder for require()
[20:22] mikeal: that's their concern, not you, not your app
[20:22] wadey: ksmith: you are supposed to run it from the project you want the packages for
[20:22] ksmith: well, where should I run npm install then to install coffee-script?
[20:22] supjeff: mikeal: hmm
[20:22] wadey: ksmith: do "npm install -g"
[20:22] wadey: to install globally
[20:22] supjeff: mikeal: but what do you think of the syntax?
[20:22] tprice: what would the install folder of nodejs on debian 5?
[20:22] supjeff: :p
[20:22] wadey: the default is to install "locally"
[20:22] chjj: i wish the python syntax were less ugly
[20:23] mikeal: the syntax is beautiful, i'm just over it :)
[20:23] chjj: the colons throw me off
[20:23] supjeff: chjj: whoa, what?
[20:23] ksmith: wadey: ah, ok. is there a way to make it global by default?
[20:23] stalled has joined the channel
[20:23] mikeal: syntax doesn't protect me from side effects and not block me from writing my app
[20:23] chjj: a colon after a right paranthesis by itself just looks ugly to me
[20:23] mikeal: there are more important things than syntax
[20:23] wadey: ksmith: read the FAQ here: https://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/doc/faq.md
[20:23] Bonuspunkt has joined the channel
[20:24] tsesame_: a colon after a right parens makes me feel sad for some reason
[20:24] chjj: it does!
[20:24] supjeff: chjj: do you prefer the staches?
[20:24] ksmith: hmm and why ain't it recommended?
[20:24] chjj: dont know why, but that language was never aesthetically pleasing to my eye
[20:24] nlco: why is this occuring? https://gist.github.com/981638
[20:24] wadey: ksmith: because you will run into dependency hell :)
[20:24] mikeal: i actually hate { }
[20:25] mikeal: but i'm over it
[20:25] chjj: everyone hates curly braces
[20:25] chjj: why?
[20:25] supjeff: ksmith: so you can run multiple projects that are completely sealed off from each other
[20:25] jmoyers: object.__RIDICULOUS__
[20:25] chjj: i like them, i actually like them more than significant whitespace
[20:25] mikeal: that's the thing about syntax, even when you don't like it, you get over it pretty quick
[20:25] tjholowaychuk: braces are nice, nothing worse than 100 lines of crap
[20:25] tjholowaychuk: that you cant tell where it ends
[20:25] chjj: significant whitespace just looks so fragile to me
[20:25] tjholowaychuk: because it's indented
[20:25] tjholowaychuk: i've had tons of people show me CS for express config
[20:26] tjholowaychuk: and it's broken
[20:26] tjholowaychuk: because they indented shit wrong
[20:26] skiz has joined the channel
[20:26] supjeff: yeah, but if they had the braces and indented shit wrong, their code would look stupid
[20:26] tsesame_: IMO significant whitespace only belongs to the realm of declarative langs
[20:27] chjj: tsesame_: agreed
[20:27] supjeff: I don't know, I like significant whitespace
[20:27] chjj: in a declarative language it looks nice and declaritive languages are usually more concise
[20:27] supjeff: I write my code that way anyway
[20:27] supjeff: saves me having to type {s
[20:27] tjholowaychuk: it only looks good when it's your code
[20:27] xtianw has joined the channel
[20:27] tjholowaychuk: and if you're not an idiot
[20:28] tjholowaychuk: writing massive methods
[20:28] tjholowaychuk: and tons of nesting
[20:28] ksmith: thanks guys :) it was just a couple of packages anyway … I guess if I'll ever get serious about node programming I'll appreciate the ability to install packages locally
[20:28] supjeff: huge, swinging methods
[20:28] ksmith: ls
[20:28] supjeff: ksmith
[20:29] supjeff: if you're just doing it casually, stick to local. Make a dir for your test project, cd in there and npm install your stuff
[20:29] supjeff: then when youre done, just delete the dir
[20:29] supjeff: no mess
[20:30] supjeff: or if you want to make a few test projects, make a dir called 'node_projects'
[20:30] supjeff: cd in there, npm install your shit, then make subdirectories for each throwaway project
[20:31] ksmith: well, I really can't see the benefit of doing that vs. installing the packages globally, as long as I'm just playing around
[20:31] supjeff: node.js will crawl your directory tree looking for node_modules
[20:31] supjeff: when you're done playing around, you'll have a bunch of node packages installed somewhere in /var/opt or whatever
[20:31] Renegade001 has joined the channel
[20:31] ksmith: it's basically what I'm used to from other package managers
[20:31] supjeff: ACTION doesn't know where npm installs stuff with -g
[20:32] supjeff: oh, in that case
[20:32] ksmith: it's /usr/local/lib
[20:32] supjeff: mm
[20:33] supjeff: tjholowaychuk: you can set textmate to show invisible characters. It would show you indentation levels.
[20:33] supjeff: just sayin
[20:33] chjj: a parallel universe
[20:33] tjholowaychuk: haha
[20:33] jbpros has joined the channel

[20:35] supjeff: it's just a little mark for a tab, and a mark for a line break
[20:35] wookiehangover has joined the channel

[20:35] jmoyers: dont get me wrong, i've written some coffeescript for small projects
[20:35] jmoyers: i like it
[20:35] chjj: ksmith: we dont like it, were just here for the lively conversation
[20:35] supjeff: I like that node is small, simple and fast
[20:36] tsesame_: node is trendy yo
[20:36] supjeff: the evented paradigm is appealling to me
[20:36] rbranson: i like how it V8 a garbage collector not designed for server applications
[20:36] tilgovi has joined the channel
[20:36] tilgovi has joined the channel
[20:36] rbranson: and how I have poor grammar skills
[20:36] supjeff: all these other server packages are trying to figure out how to do more than one thing at the same time efficiently
[20:36] andi5: The API correlates best with what webservers are today.
[20:37] supjeff: and javascript was built that way
[20:37] chjj: i like its simplicity yeah, it just gives you v8 with a unified, consistent io api
[20:37] supjeff: yeah
[20:37] chjj: it doesnt assume youre writing a webserver, or what youre doing with it
[20:37] ksmith: I'm just asking as I'm only exposed to JS in frontend dev and I never thought of actually doing something else with it until recently.
[20:37] chjj: it doesnt make assumptions
[20:37] chjj: omg
[20:37] supjeff: and there are factors that compete with each other to make javascript run faster and faster
[20:38] chjj: a real live clientside javascripter!
[20:38] supjeff: lol
[20:38] chjj: i love my bias againt clientside only JSers, sorry ;p
[20:38] supjeff: does js run on the clientside?
[20:38] chjj: haha
[20:38] chjj: apparently
[20:39] supjeff: can I get the github for client-side js?
[20:39] supjeff: that would be crazy
[20:39] tsesame_: so then was is vbscript?
[20:39] jiggliemon has joined the channel
[20:39] supjeff: ksmith: I think nodejs is the future of web servers
[20:40] taf2: i think you're the future of webservers :P
[20:40] tbranyen: different kind of coding, i see so many mistakes and misunderstandings in a lot of node.js projects

[20:40] Opaque has joined the channel
[20:40] burg has joined the channel
[20:40] tbranyen: chjj: shouldn't be a competition between client and server, but the competency of the coder
[20:40] jmoyers: i see a lot of mistakes and misunderstandings in every programming language
[20:40] supjeff: ksmith: imagine you make a form on a site, you write some scripts to validate the user input. You could use the same exact validation on the server.
[20:40] yozgrahame has joined the channel
[20:40] tbranyen: jmoyers: exactly
[20:40] chjj: tbranyen: i didnt say it was a competition
[20:41] tbranyen: thanks for assisting with my point :D
[20:41] tjholowaychuk:  a few days ago i saw /&/.test(str) in defunkt's code
[20:41] tsesame_: the problem I think is that server code tends to be more complex, and the callback styling of coding doesn't really scale well, at least for beginners
[20:41] tjholowaychuk: fail
[20:41] chjj: haha
[20:41] skiz has joined the channel
[20:41] tbranyen: tsesame_: thats what i don't get, jquery the most popular js lib does just fine with loads of nested callbacks
[20:41] tjholowaychuk: but at least all the ruby ppl are using CS
[20:41] tjholowaychuk: so i know not to use it
[20:42] tbranyen: and its very noob friendly
[20:42] supjeff: tsesame_: that's event driven programming
[20:42] chjj: tsesame_: wait, you said there was a problem somewhere?
[20:42] jmoyers: every single day
[20:42] supjeff: it's the documentation
[20:42] jmoyers: callbacks are hard
[20:42] skiz: tbranyen: you can easily use the events also
[20:42] jmoyers: every single day
[20:42] jmoyers: mailing list
[20:42] tsesame_: tbranyen:  But I don't think you approach the complexity on a clientthat you would on a full-blown server app
[20:42] skiz: all jquery methods generally also fire events
[20:42] jmoyers: some new library for COMPILING callbacks out of the code
[20:42] jmoyers: thats insane
[20:42] tbranyen: skiz: all events have callbacks...
[20:42] chjj: tsesame_: i completely agree
[20:42] jmoyers: it takes like 20 minutes to research a flow control library and move on
[20:43] chjj: i dont even think you can use JS to its full potential on the client
[20:43] ksmith: tjholowaychuk: is there any reason for you to not like it?
[20:43] tsesame_: express and other frameworks seem to mitigate a lot of that
[20:43] tbranyen: chjj: yeah nobody is writing awesome client side web apps
[20:43] jmoyers: oh yeah
[20:43] Samot: anyone tried node.js clustering on linode?
[20:43] jmoyers: ajax.org isn't doing shit
[20:43] jmoyers: really
[20:43] supjeff: I understand the difficulty in thinking about everything evented
[20:43] jmoyers: when you think about it
[20:43] ksmith: tjholowaychuk: I mean … have you actually tried it or is it just … well, I don't know, you don't like the concept?
[20:43] chjj: no, i mean, client side js simply doesnt give you the opportunity to really *USE* javascript
[20:43] gazumps has joined the channel
[20:43] tjholowaychuk: ksmith yeah i've tried it
[20:43] tjholowaychuk: i'm not getting started
[20:44] Lorentz has joined the channel
[20:44] supjeff: chjj: what are you talking about
[20:44] mikegerwitz: chjj: I disagree. I've written some fairly large cleint-side apps that have taken advantage of JS far more than my server app.
[20:44] Samot: could you elaborate chjj?
[20:45] supjeff: yeah really
[20:45] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[20:45] chjj: lol
[20:45] supjeff: WTF chjj 
[20:45] mikegerwitz: (if by "taking advantage of JS", you mean features of the language itself)
[20:45] chjj: im surprised at so many disagreements
[20:45] Samot: not disagreeing 
[20:45] Samot: just don't understand what you mean by USE
[20:45] supjeff: ^
[20:45] tsesame_: mikegerwitz:  Large isn't always more complex, just saying..  when you start talking about DB calls and other forms of I/O...
[20:46] chjj: i mean use to its fullest potential, for lack of a better phrase
[20:46] Samot: hrm?
[20:46] tsesame_: I mean I guess you could be doing a lot of crazy AJAX
[20:46] ksmith: good night :)
[20:46] ksmith has left the channel
[20:46] supjeff: tsesame_: it only got weird for me when I made this big pyramid of callbacks with redis
[20:46] chjj: client side js, doesnt have anything *terribly* complex going on
[20:46] taf2: client side js is the shit
[20:46] Samot: I am working on something which uses intense js lol http://protosal.com
[20:46] rbranson: lol
[20:46] rbranson: "<chjj> client side js, doesnt have anything *terribly* complex going on"
[20:47] mikegerwitz: tsesame_: I personally find client-side logic more complex, beacuse I deal less with GUIs. Whereas I've dealt with low-level stuff my entire career.
[20:47] supjeff: chjj: what if you write an email client or other nutty web app
[20:48] mikegerwitz: I'm not going to argue tha server-side software can be more complex, though. I generally agree with that.
[20:48] chjj: how many streaming parsers do you have to write on the client side, why did all the async tools almost exclusive get created because of node?
[20:48] chjj: etc
[20:48] mikegerwitz: argue the point that*
[20:48] chjj: exclusively*
[20:48] supjeff: chjj: why do opposites attract?

[20:50] Samot: I haven't ever used in node.js though only as a client framework

[20:50] supjeff: cI can't wait to try backbone
[20:50] tsesame_: Backbone looks cool I just don't know how to use it yet
[20:50] Samot: follow my tutorials lol
[20:50] supjeff: but I don't feel like I have a strong enough grasp of oop and evented stuff yet
[20:51] chjj: so im confused, people really think client side code is as complex as serverside code?
[20:51] Samot: client side code can be pretty complex
[20:51] tsesame_: Samot: Will def check them out when the time comes
[20:51] syskk has joined the channel
[20:51] chjj: confused and surprised*
[20:51] supjeff: clientside can be crazy
[20:51] supjeff: but let's agree
[20:52] Samot: i have asynchronous working code on the client
[20:52] tsesame_: chjj: I think it has the potential to be, but on average I think server code is usually more complex
[20:52] supjeff: the burden of the web experience can be shifted between client and server fairly equally
[20:52] tsesame_: It all comes down to the application you're writing right
[20:52] chjj: i used to be more of a client side guy
[20:53] supjeff: look at it this way, a back-end that did nothing but return database records in JSON could still be a damn-good back end.
[20:53] tsesame_: I think the server code of a simple chat server using something like now.js will have more complex client code
[20:53] tsesame_: er I mean will be simpler than the client code
[20:53] Samot: Try writing a single page app
[20:54] supjeff: I can't say which is generally more complex, it's all about how you divide up the labour
[20:56] chjj: a lot of it is my personal bias: before i came to node, any coder's js for the browser made me want to vomit, it was all horrible, it was only once i came to node that i saw real programmers writing good code in js
[20:56] supjeff: yeah, I do my best not to look at my colleagues front-end code
[20:56] rbranson: heh
[20:56] Samot: writing js for the browser is not easy though
[20:57] hij1nx has joined the channel
[20:57] tsesame_: Is it safe to say that if you write bad node.js code you'll pay a heavier price than writing bad client code?
[20:57] supjeff: I'm finding myself more repulsed by front-end dev every day
[20:57] chjj: tsesame_: i was about to bring that up actually, hehe
[20:57] supjeff: tsesame_: but why would you say that
[20:58] fakewaffle: is there a module for image resizing?
[20:58] tsesame_: more things can go wrong and for worse at the server
[20:58] chjj: bad serverside code will segfault and drop your entire server, bad code in the browser may only effect one person
[20:58] rbranson: eh
[20:58] supjeff: eh
[20:58] rbranson: segfault?
[20:58] supjeff: stacktrace and whatnot

[20:59] chjj: no, i havent, i havent...tried...

[21:11] pquerna: is there some way to get at what stderr is using?
[21:12] tjholowaychuk: pquerna process.binding('stdio').stderrFD maybe
[21:12] jerrysv: pquerna: that and posix defines stderr as 2
[21:13] pquerna: well right, I was trying to avoid just hard coding 2 :)

[21:37] olalonde: you're mistaking cause and effect ;)

[21:47] Marak: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2565377 there we go

[21:48] draginx: bitcoins is unhackable
[21:48] nlco: nlco
[21:48] AAA_awright:  olalonde: It has various frontends, but only one can be attached to the backend at a time, one of them is HTTP yeah
[21:48] draginx: Marak: funny
[21:48] draginx: you know why i asked about that graph project?
[21:48] AAA_awright: My problem with it is that it's not flexible enough
[21:48] tjgillies: you can hack bitcoins. lose faith in them. their value will drop
[21:48] draginx: its because im making a real time bitcoin thing xD
[21:48] draginx: u cannot hack btc lol

[21:48] chjj: how long have bit coins been around anyway>?
[21:49] AAA_awright: draginx: Hey I'm thinking about that too
[21:49] sechrist: so I have a computing cluster that isn't being used
[21:49] Marak: tjgillies: no need to hack the tech, hacking the economy is way more fun
[21:49] draginx: chjj 1+ years at least
[21:49] sechrist: is it beneficial to generate these things
[21:49] draginx: AAA_awright: awesome :D you'll probably do it better and faster than me since Im a newb at node :(
[21:49] Marak: tjgillies: no central authority means i can do whatever the fuck i want, try to stop me :-)
[21:49] draginx: sechrist: atm no the difficulty is way to high imo

[21:58] AAA_awright: socket.io
[21:58] draginx: yup i know what that is :D lol
[21:58] jhurliman: dumb question, but what is the difference between socket.io and dnode?
[21:59] chjj: dnode is rpc
[21:59] jhurliman: ah
[21:59] chjj: socket.io abstracts away things like xhr, websockets, etc
[21:59] chjj: into one api
[22:00] gm___ has joined the channel
[22:00] jhurliman: dnode is also bidirectional and operates on top of xhr, websockets, etc, correct? so it's one layer higher in the stack than socket.io, so to speak?

[22:02] jmoyers: not totally sure about that
[22:02] chjj: jmoyers: yeah, i explained that to him, he was asking if dnode could sit on top of socket.io
[22:02] jmoyers: it.. does
[22:02] jmoyers: by default
[22:02] jmoyers: pretty sure
[22:02] jhurliman: got it, thanks

[22:22] Tobsn: anyone a suggestion how to best fetch multiple http requests at the same time and work through them when its done?
[22:23] aaronblohowiak: Tobsn: seq might make that easy
[22:23] aaronblohowiak: or async or any of those
[22:23] Tobsn: im looking at step right now
[22:24] Tobsn: you think seq would give me any benefits?
[22:24] chjj: Tobsn: you should use a parallel loop if you want to buffer them all and look at them as one collection
[22:24] Tobsn: so step and this.parallel() ?
[22:24] chjj: push them onto an array
[22:24] chjj: yeah, that would work in step
[22:24] Tobsn: k
[22:24] Tobsn: still trying to understand step haha
[22:24] Tobsn: its so simple its hard to understand :P
[22:25] Tobsn: i basically need to read 3-4 different xml feeds and mix them up based on a single field within each feed
[22:26] chjj: in step you would do step(function() { request('..', this.parallel()); request('..', this.parallel()); }, function() { // and one big collection here });
[22:27] Tobsn: yeah
[22:27] Tobsn: hmm
[22:27] Tobsn: last function would have function( result1, result2, result3 ) or would you somehow push the result in an array and if so, where do you specify that with this.parallel() ?
[22:28] chjj: or at least i think, i dont really use step
[22:28] Lorentz has joined the channel
[22:28] Tobsn: yeah it somehow works like that
[22:28] chjj: i think it just gives you a big array of the results
[22:28] tjholowaychuk: pquerna: i'll have a module soon, i've wanted a tracer as well
[22:28] chjj: not sure, i usually just include my own little step function if i need one
[22:28] chjj: its easy to write a really simple one in a couple lines
[22:29] Tobsn: the example with two read files shows step( function load(){ fs.read( file1, this.parallel() ); fs.read( file2, this.parallel(); );}, function show( err, file1, file2 ){ ... })
[22:30] Tobsn: but i dont see how i would push the read() output into an array
[22:30] chjj: i think it does that for you, it concatenates the arguments into a big array i think
[22:31] pibi_home has joined the channel
[22:31] chjj: not sure though, lemme look
[22:31] edude03 has joined the channel
[22:31] Tobsn: maybe there is something in the this object but i cant see it
[22:32] chjj: yeah it does
[22:32] chjj: it will give you a `results` array
[22:32] chjj: oh, it actually does .apply
[22:32] chjj: so it will be multiple arguments
[22:33] Tobsn: ah, i see, maybe just Step( function() { req(..., this.parallel(); ) req( ...same.. ); }, function( err, result ){} );
[22:33] Tobsn: ah okay
[22:33] aaronblohowiak: chjj: Why was the Priest tough on the orphan functions?
[22:33] chjj: Tobsn, thats what im telling you
[22:33] Tobsn: i just gonna try it
[22:33] chjj: hehe
[22:33] Tobsn: yep
[22:33] Tobsn: hehe
[22:33] aaronblohowiak: chjj:  they didn't .apply themselves
[22:33] Tobsn: i was stuck in different function name() blah with one receiving end function that needs arguments
[22:33] Tobsn: lemme just try it
[22:33] Tobsn: :P
[22:34] chjj: arronblohowiak: oh i see what you did ther
[22:34] liar has joined the channel
[22:36] Tobsn: would be http.request( {options}, this.parallel() ); right?
[22:37] piscisaureus__ has joined the channel
[22:38] chjj: http.request by itself is evented
[22:38] chjj: you cant just give a callback
[22:38] Tobsn: what you mean?
[22:38] pquerna: tjholowaychuk: sweet, thanks
[22:38] Tobsn: i actually never requested anything external over http so i have no clue
[22:39] tjholowaychuk: pquerna pretty much done just going to polish it up a bit
[22:39] chjj: youll need to do var req = http.request(options, function(res) { res.on('data', function() { ... } }); req.end();
[22:40] chjj: so youll have to write your own little function that abstracts that into a simpler interface first
[22:40] chjj: and buffer the response data
[22:40] Tobsn: oh jezz

[22:51] jmoyers: why have a flat namespace
[22:52] jmoyers: but in theory, if you want to expose everything as /, then can't you recurse through your public directory and set more static handlers?

[22:52] tjholowaychuk: that doesnt sound right

[22:53] skm has joined the channel
[22:53] tjholowaychuk: that's kinda wrong
[22:53] tjholowaychuk: haha
[22:53] jmoyers: seems whacky
[22:53] fakewaffle: why?
[22:53] chjj: Tobsn: no problem, you might want to tailor it to your needs a little bit, but its a good template
[22:53] jmoyers: why have them in directories
[22:54] jmoyers: if you are going to want to serve them out of one 'directory'
[22:54] jmoyers: generally static file servers respect the file system
[22:54] jmoyers: for a reason
[22:54] fakewaffle: organization?
[22:54] jmoyers: you organize things thematically or functionally
[22:54] jmoyers: javascript, css, etc
[22:54] fakewaffle: yes
[22:54] fakewaffle: and if i want to use jquery, other things, those go into /javascrip/jquery/...
[22:54] jmoyers: so why is serving different?
[22:55] fakewaffle: im confused on the routing?
[22:55] tjholowaychuk: so do GET /javascripts/jquery/whatever.js
[22:55] jmoyers: ^^
[22:55] fakewaffle: this isnt just for one app though, sorry
[22:55] fakewaffle: i guess i didnt make that clear
[22:55] skm has joined the channel
[22:55] jmoyers: two apps doesn't preclude respecting the directory structure for serving
[22:56] jmoyers: or three or four
[22:56] jmoyers: look at CDNs
[22:56] jmoyers: they usually still have some directory
[22:56] jmoyers: what if two different directories both hae a lib.js? or a util.js
[22:56] jmoyers: just seems like trouble to me
[22:56] tjholowaychuk: yeah you could iterate and set up static()s per "app"
[22:56] tjholowaychuk: but
[22:56] fakewaffle: im not following, it doesnt sound like what i want
[22:56] tjholowaychuk: i wouldnt do it that way
[22:57] jmoyers: my guess is, you just want one static()
[22:57] jtsnow has joined the channel
[22:57] jmoyers: it treats what you pass in to static() as the document root
[22:57] jmoyers: in apache speak
[22:58] fakewaffle: im more confused now...
[22:58] fakewaffle: haha

[22:59] jmoyers: what do folks use to simulate a socket.io *client* for testing server side code?
[22:59] jmoyers: is there a simple module that simulates server side?
[23:00] tbranyen: jmoyers: simulate client or server side
[23:00] jmoyers: simulate client side
[23:00] mcantelon has joined the channel
[23:00] jmoyers: like i have a test suite im writing
[23:00] jmoyers: that needs to simulate 3-4 clients connecting and sending updates to the server handlers

[23:27] vikstrous: What do you guys think of stylus sprite? https://github.com/andris9/stylus-sprite
[23:27] vikstrous: I want to make something similar but better
[23:28] tjholowaychuk: vikstrous haven't seen it
[23:28] tjholowaychuk: until now
[23:28] tjholowaychuk: haha
[23:28] eee_c has joined the channel
[23:28] vikstrous: oh hi tjholowaychuk, just the right person to talk to about this :P
[23:28] tjholowaychuk: i would use node-canvas
[23:28] iori has joined the channel
[23:28] maqr has joined the channel
[23:29] vikstrous: the point of this is to combine icons into sprites to reduce bandwidth and improve load times
[23:30] tjholowaychuk: totally
[23:30] skiz has joined the channel
[23:30] tjholowaychuk: I'm aware of spriting no worries
[23:30] vikstrous: so how would canvas do the same thing?
[23:30] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[23:30] tjholowaychuk: oh
[23:30] tjholowaychuk: how
[23:30] tjholowaychuk: haha
[23:30] chjj: screw sprites, use base64'd images in your stylesheet ;)
[23:30] vikstrous: isn't canvas the html5 canvas??
[23:30] tjholowaychuk: well it's the canvas api you can manipulate images however you like
[23:30] tjholowaychuk: chjj yeah that's what we do
[23:31] chjj: yeah, its amazing
[23:31] chjj: its amazing how great things are when you ignore IE

[23:32] tjholowaychuk: vikstrous stylus has it built in
[23:32] chjj: i guess i dont pay attention to ie so i wouldnt know ;)
[23:32] chjj: i dont pay attention anymore at least
[23:32] vikstrous: the base64 images?
[23:32] chjj: freed myself from being a slave to that terrible browser
[23:32] tjholowaychuk: $ cat lib/functions/url.js
[23:33] BillyBreen has joined the channel
[23:33] vikstrous: ok well in any case it doesn't sound like any of these things are actual sprites...

[23:34] tjholowaychuk: jk
[23:34] duncanbeevers: Seems a little niche. I haven't actually benchmarked the performance of inlining fonts.
[23:34] jmoyers: noooo, don't remind me of the black hole that is reddit rage comics
[23:35] duncanbeevers: I've been moving to two stylesheets per page with inlined assets in the 2nd one, referenced at the bottom of the page.
[23:35] jmoyers: i will go there and emerge hours later, haggard and spent
[23:35] shimondoodkin has joined the channel
[23:35] vikstrous: tjholowaychuk: well, do you have any ideas of what i should make? i want to make something for node, but it seems like everything cool is already being done
[23:36] tjholowaychuk: vikstrous i kinda want node-canvas stuff
[23:36] tjholowaychuk: for stylus
[23:36] tjholowaychuk: to draw shapes
[23:36] tjholowaychuk: and data-uri those
[23:36] tjholowaychuk: for common shapes like tip nipples
[23:36] tjholowaychuk: haha
[23:36] tjholowaychuk: because i hate photoshop
[23:36] vikstrous: can you explain a bit more?
[23:36] chapel: for nipples
[23:37] chapel: wow tjholowaychuk

[23:38] hermanjunge: Marak, did you recover anything?
[23:38] tjholowaychuk: vikstrous http://onehackoranother.com/projects/jquery/tipsy/
[23:38] tjholowaychuk: for example
[23:38] tjholowaychuk: if those tooltip arrows
[23:38] Marak: all is lost
[23:38] tjholowaychuk: are little images
[23:38] tjholowaychuk: but
[23:38] hermanjunge: Damned, I'm sorry man
[23:38] Marak: my only hope now is to write more node.js code
[23:38] tjholowaychuk: canvas could easily generate those
[23:38] tjholowaychuk: and color them
[23:38] Marak: hermanjunge: :-p 
[23:38] vikstrous: ahh interesting
[23:38] tjholowaychuk: so if you want to change the tip color
[23:38] hermanjunge: you really spent 6k on bitcoins?
[23:38] tjholowaychuk: you dont have to do photoshop work
[23:39] hermanjunge: I almost start to invest
[23:39] Marak: hermanjunge: lol fuck no
[23:39] Marak: :-D
[23:39] vikstrous: sounds good. what was that about data uris?
[23:39] hermanjunge: HA! how many money did you spent?
[23:39] abraham has joined the channel
[23:39] tjholowaychuk: vikstrous: thats how you inline the image data in the css
[23:39] tjholowaychuk: so you don't have external files
[23:39] tjholowaychuk: since they are tiny
[23:39] Marak: hermanjunge: $0.00
[23:40] hermanjunge: I don't get it. I thought you were spending like crazy on those bitcoins
[23:40] hermanjunge: :P
[23:40] vikstrous: tjholowaychuk:  oh i've never done that. i'll have to look into it
[23:40] tjholowaychuk: should be on wikipedia
[23:40] jTNT has joined the channel
[23:40] vikstrous: would this be a part of stylus or a separate module?
[23:40] tjholowaychuk: separate
[23:41] vikstrous: and what kind of things other than tooltips would it draw?
[23:41] tjholowaychuk: hmMmm
[23:41] tjholowaychuk: good question haha that was the obvious one that i wanted before
[23:41] vikstrous: pretty list bullets?
[23:41] tjholowaychuk: hmm
[23:41] tjholowaychuk: yeah maybe
[23:41] vikstrous: navigation triangle thingies...
[23:41] hermanjunge: Marak: I've read one article of yours where you talked about the 10 apps TODO on nodejs,
[23:42] Marak: hermanjunge: aye, a bit outdated, but still good
[23:42] hermanjunge: marak: Question: Has someone started to code a CMS on nodejs?
[23:42] tjholowaychuk: vikstrous i guess maybe just look around at designer sites n whatnot
[23:42] Marak: hermanjunge: im sure many initiatives, there are listings on the node.js wiki 
[23:42] tjholowaychuk: see what can be generalized
[23:42] vikstrous: tjholowaychuk: alright. I'll do some research and i'll see what i come up with
[23:43] tjholowaychuk: cool man
[23:43] tjholowaychuk: im sure you could use svg for icons or something too
[23:43] tjholowaychuk: but i guess icons
[23:43] tjholowaychuk: are already made
[23:43] tjholowaychuk: so i dont have to open photoshop anyway
[23:44] vikstrous: hmm i've never used svg icons on a site
[23:44] vikstrous: do you normally render them as png for compatibility anyways?
[23:44] vikstrous: or do you keep them as svg?
[23:44] tjholowaychuk: there's a font called iconic or something with little icons
[23:44] tjholowaychuk: pretty cool idea
[23:44] tjholowaychuk: i have it in nib
[23:45] jTNT: hermanjunge: I'm working on a cms. I've spoken to others who are too.
[23:45] AaronMT has joined the channel
[23:45] vikstrous: oh interesting. if we take a font with icons and then use it to build an appropriate image we can use that for bullets

[23:47] broofa has joined the channel
[23:47] AAA_awright: I'm in my third redesign because the old paradigms of coding just don't translate well
[23:48] AAA_awright: And that's been the dying reason for existing blog systems/content management systems
[23:48] hermanjunge: Lol, I've had some trouble getting the event-oriented paradigm. I'm hardwired to OOP
[23:49] AAA_awright: It's not just OOP
[23:49] Marak: hermanjunge: EventEmitter is a fun place to start
[23:49] AAA_awright: It's templates more than anything else
[23:49] jTNT: hermanjunge: sorry, no name. nothing to share yet. but I'm happy to discuss approaches and share snippets if you're gonna have a go at it too.
