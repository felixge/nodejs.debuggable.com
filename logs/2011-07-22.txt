[00:01] AvianFlu: JSON.parse() is the only thing you should ever try-catch
[00:01] AvianFlu: nothing else in core uses throw
[00:01] jameson: haha this is awesome
[00:02] jameson: but where is charlie lulo
[00:02] TheJH: AvianFlu, how about parseInt?
[00:02] AvianFlu: is that another one?
[00:02] AvianFlu: I'd love a big list of all those
[00:02] TheJH: .. parseInt("foo")
[00:02] catb0t: 13NaN
[00:03] TheJH: oh, I thought that it would throw...
[00:03] jameson: NaN
[00:03] jameson: :( I want purple
[00:03] jhurliman: the downside of asynchronous programming is sometimes useless stack traces :-\
[00:03] jhurliman: Error: ENOTFOUND, Domain name not found
[00:03] jhurliman:    at IOWatcher.callback (dns.js:74:15)
[00:03] AvianFlu: ENOTFOUND isn't the kind of thing you want a stack trace for, though
[00:03] TheJH: jhurliman, there's ane xperimental branch that has back-tracking stack traces
[00:04] TheJH: dunno how experimental it is
[00:04] jhurliman: AvianFlu, it's not?
[00:04] AvianFlu: I take that back, I guess you might
[00:04] AvianFlu: I was thinking that "domain name not found" was more of an external problem
[00:04] tjholowaychuk: jhurliman haha yeah it is kinda annoying. i had to bust out strace today just to see where a socket related error was even coming from
[00:04] AvianFlu: but I guess if you were doing a bunch of DNS resolves you might want to know which one was which
[00:05] AvianFlu: yeah, that makes sense
[00:05] jhurliman: i'm pretty sure i got that stack trace e-mailed to me by the part of my app that catches unhandled exceptions, right before it takes down the whole node app and brings it up again. because it failed to resolve a domain name
[00:05] Sam_K: If I don't try/ctach around http.listen(), and the port cannot be opened, then the script will bomb out without giving me a chance to do anything afterwards
[00:05] TheJH: can a core dev or so say something about this branch? https://github.com/joyent/node/tree/eventsource
[00:05] AvianFlu: jhurliman: yeah that would drive me nuts, you're definitely right on that
[00:06] jhurliman: TheJH, that's cool someone is working on that
[00:08] TheJH: jhurliman, can you estimate how usable it is at the moment?
[00:08] jellosea: has anybody here used node-fiberize? i need some help understand how it works
[00:08] Sam_K: AvianFlu: so http.listen will throw if port cannot be bound
[00:08] jhurliman: TheJH, this is the first time i've heard of that branch. no idea, sorry
[00:08] jerrysv: sync fs calls use throw if memory serves

[05:22] jordo: If something at a high level rearranges the structure.

[06:18] blkcat: peregrine81: you might want to hit up #express and find tj, sounds like it could be a bug
[06:18] peregrine81: blkcat: all crickets over there :S

[06:19] peregrine81: devaholic: I'm not mocking it. put is a standard HTTP verb and I should be able to PUT to it. 
[06:19] devaholic: i need a beer
[06:19] jordo: no luck there.
[06:19] blkcat: devaholic: the methodOverride hack is for clients that don't support the full http vocabulary natively

[06:43] jordo: It seems like if burrito allowed updating as traversing, it's a 'complete' parsing library, but without that there are some problems it can't solve
[06:43] jordo: (just my intuition at this point)

[07:26] camel_: ah i see 
[07:27] dexter_e: Is it necessary to use 2 different templating schemes if you would like to include a bunch of templates for in-Browser use into the html file?
[07:28] jetienne: dexter_e: no, many template engine work on both
[07:28] dexter_e: right I'm using EJS on the server, but it won't ignore my templates being sent to browser
[07:29] ivan has joined the channel
[07:29] dexter_e: I use <%-  values  %>     but if I want to include a bunch of templates in script tags for in-browser use , the render method throws errors on the templates. 
[07:30] seivan has joined the channel
[07:30] jborst has joined the channel
[07:31] dexter_e: I was under the impression that templates for in-browser rendering should be included in <script> tags   right?
[07:32] jensn has joined the channel
[07:32] jetienne: dexter_e: the <script> with custom type is just a candy
[07:33] dexter_e: So..     how do we make the render() method ignore the <%%> of our browser-only templates ?
[07:33] jetienne: dexter_e: this is a way to make them easily editable by the user. not at all a requirement
[07:33] jetienne: i dunno... you can escape those characteres if you need to 
[07:33] devaholic: use mustache for your client side, ejs for server side
[07:33] devaholic: thats what i do
[07:34] dexter_e: How do we ship templates to browser ?
[07:34] [AD]Turbo has joined the channel
[07:34] dexter_e: In script tags? 
[07:34] devaholic: i do,yes
[07:34] jetienne: dexter_e: or simply in a request
[07:34] dexter_e: In other words we DO need two different templating schemes 
[07:34] dexter_e: otherwise they collide during render ..
[07:34] jetienne: dexter_e: i mean dont interpret the template server side
[07:34] devaholic: its useful, but i dont think you *have* to
[07:35] [AD]Turbo: hi there
[07:35] seivan_ has joined the channel
[07:35] jetienne: dexter_e: nope, just dont use express render() when sending the template, if you dont want to interpret it server side
[07:35] jetienne: res.send(templatetext)
[07:35] dexter_e: but then how do we inject the dynamic dependencies n stuff ?
[07:36] jetienne: what do you mean
[07:36] dexter_e: different users will have different modules enabled and loaded, so they must get different packages shipped to them
[07:36] mscdex: jetienne: no, just the json
[07:36] jetienne: mscdex: and from the json, you generate the html ?
[07:37] devaholic: imo, its better to just use ejs/mustache
[07:37] jetienne: dexter_e: how does this relate to template ?
[07:37] mscdex: from the json you can do whatever you want with it
[07:37] mscdex: :-)
[07:37] jetienne: mscdex: ok :)
[07:37] mscdex: i've put that project on hold for a bit though
[07:37] mscdex: i do have a decent start on it though
[07:37] dexter_e: the templates are modified depending on the user
[07:38] dexter_e: isn't this how any database app works ?
[07:38] dexter_e: request analysed :  response sent: we can't just send a static file to every user
[07:38] ggg has joined the channel
[07:38] ggg: hi 
[07:38] dexter_e: jetienne: are you suggesting sending static files to every user?
[07:38] ggg: someone can explain me how to import modules in cloud9 ??
[07:38] jetienne: dexter_e: right now im not sure i understand what you want
[07:39] jetienne: dexter_e: you started on a template escaping issue, then you talk about multi user, and now database
[07:39] jetienne: maybe this is me, early morning, not enougth sleep
[07:39] jetienne: 9:40 am... but i started coding at 6am... due to jetlag
[07:40] ggg: i cant sleep, so decided to code
[07:40] dexter_e: jetienne: Do we need two templating schemes to run in-browser templates 
[07:40] dexter_e: its just one issue
[07:40] jetienne: dexter_e: as i said previously, no :)
[07:41] dexter_e: jetienne: but the solution you're suggesting is turn off interpretation on server right?
[07:41] dexter_e: in other words send static files to all users
[07:41] dexter_e: devaholic: It sounds like you're using two schemes eh ?
[07:41] jetienne: dexter_e: yes. if you want to interpret a template server side *AND* then client side, you need to escape the clientside template *before* interpreting it server side
[07:42] jetienne: with ejs, you can change the delimiter if escaping is an issue
[07:42] devaholic: dexter_e: you dont *need* two schemes but its obviously going to make things easier in some aspects
[07:42] jetienne: on client use <% %> and on server use <? ?> ... it is a possibility at least
[07:43] dexter_e: but those are two schemes
[07:43] jetienne: dexter_e: yep, or you do the escaping
[07:43] devaholic: mustache already works with underscore, backbone.js, etc, and ejs is the most natural server side template, so i go with those
[07:43] jetienne: dexter_e: no other choise
[07:43] dexter_e: you mean escaping the <% %> ?
[07:43] jetienne: yes
[07:44] devaholic: dexter_e: you got your answer 30 lines up
[07:44] jetienne: thus the serverside wont interpret them before sending them
[07:44] jetienne: but generating template with template will be messy
[07:45] jetienne: you can do without
[07:45] jetienne: canT
[07:45] dexter_e: devaholic: it went right past me like a chinese road sign 
[07:46] dexter_e: how does escaping the <% %> look in the final template ?
[07:46] ggg: anyone uses cloud9 around here?
[07:46] dexter_e: \<\%   ?
[07:46] devaholic: whatever you want it to look like
[07:46] devaholic: oh
[07:46] devaholic: i'd just change it to {{ }} before i did that

[07:58] ProLoser|Mobile: is there like a general .profile?
[07:58] jetienne: ProLoser|Mobile: oh got it /usr/bin/vim /home/proloser/.profile
[07:58] ProLoser|Mobile: ?
[07:58] jetienne: ProLoser|Mobile: i think the ~/ fails because your conf is borked
[07:58] jetienne: so /home/proloser/.profile may find it
[07:59] jetienne: i hope for you at least
[07:59] AvianFlu: yeah ~ is probably an alias for $HOME
[07:59] tuhoojabotti: Yes.

[09:52] industrial: req.body is undefined and I dont see why :S it works fine on other urls
[09:53] industrial: is there any clear case when it doesnt set req.body for some reason?

[10:36] ThomK: Ok, I'll try here. :P I'm using Node.js + Socket.io. Idea is simple. Node.js is listening on TCP and redirects JSON to Socket.io. Here is my code: http://dpaste.com/574182/. And here comes the pain. After 20 minutes, memory usage is on 200 mb level, and growing, growing until it's killed by kernel. Can somebody look at my code and tell if there is something that can cause memory leak?
[10:37] xerox: ThomK: node has the tools to let you find the leak

[10:39] ThomK: xerox: can you give some details? readings or something?

[10:39] xerox: but first I have to find it : )
[10:39] micheil: ThomK: you may not be moving data around efficiently
[10:39] ThomK: Ok :) I'll wait :)
[10:40] guidocalvano: I get this strange seg fault when I try to bind a function
[10:40] micheil: so, for instance, the length of strJSON is probably massive.
[10:40] guidocalvano: I just want to bind a simple C++ function to the object that I'm exposing in my module
[10:40] guidocalvano: I don't even want to bind a whole class
[10:40] guidocalvano: but it just won't work
[10:42] xerox: ThomK: the slides I'm trying to find are from a recent conference, where someone gave examples of how to use those tools to benchmark/optimize your programs
[10:43] ThomK: micheil: i'm connecting to TCP server send simple JSON (from few bytes to maybe 1-2 kilobytes) then disconnects
[10:43] micheil: ThomK: probably just monitor the lengths of data that your storing
[10:43] micheil: that would be my first port of call.

[11:11] `3rdEden: ThomK it would be great if you could have a small reproducible test case where you see these leaks

[11:12] ThomK: AFAIK none disk IO. But profiler writes v8.log :P

[11:18] ThomK: So here is code again: http://dpaste.com/574182/ + on website: http://dpaste.com/574228/
[11:20] `3rdEden: ThomK just make it the test case as small as possible without depending on external code etc, so we are sure it's reproducible and cause by socket.io
[11:23] SamuraiJack: how one can run the the tests for /lib/*.js in fork of node?
[11:24] SamuraiJack: make test?

[11:31] TheJH: Is there a disconnect listener in socket.io? I need that for my "assert vanish" test

[11:31] `3rdEden: TheJH disconnect as in a user disconnect?
[11:31] TheJH: `3rdEden, yes

[11:48] FireFly|n900: It complains that your HTML isn't valid javascript

[11:51] sfoster: zokko: what do you expect to happen? node.js is not a browser environent, it doesn't give you a document object

[11:52] zokko: FireFly|n900: is there any way to make it right?
[11:52] sfoster: zokko: if you look at the ga.js tha google returns, IIRC, that too needs a DOM. 
[11:53] bnoordhuis has joined the channel
[11:53] zokko: sfoster: what is it? i'm new to this
[11:53] FireFly|n900: Well, you *could* have node impersonate a browser environment
[11:53] sfoster: What is a DOM? I think you need to read around a little and come back to this problem
[11:53] FireFly|n900: but a better question is, why do you want to run google analytics on node?
[11:54] zokko: cause someone told me that i can do it, FireFly|n900 
[11:54] sfoster: Right? Do you want to log when your server starts? Or when visitors hit some page you create?

[11:55] `3rdEden: That thing is designed for a browser, not a pure javascript env
[11:55] zokko: TheJH: i need to tell google that payment was made, and i need to do it via their script from google.analytics
[11:55] jresig: make jquery in node.js?

[11:58] akiva: anyone here using express-form?
[11:58] xerox: line 30 is the first of your problems, there is no document object because there is no document
[11:58] akiva: I am having some issues with it from within express....Cannot call method 'replace' of undefined
[11:59] akiva: I am wondering if it does not work with bodyParser()
[11:59] sfoster: zokko: I think what you want is for node.js to serve that page to a browser/http-client that requests it. node.js doesn't need to run the ga script, the browser does. So you are looking for how to have node.js serve an HTML document. You'll find that on page 1 of any node.js tutorial
[11:59] xerox: so you can't use it in the next two lines to fetch the js, you need to fetch it with node's api
[11:59] pastak has joined the channel
[12:00] xerox: and then evaluate it.  at the end you can just change document.write to console.log
[12:00] zokko: sfoster: i need to launch like like a webbrowser does. nothing more!
[12:00] xerox: just look up how to fetch stuff from the web and evaluate code in the node documentation, is very easy
[12:00] sfoster: zokko: you are asking for a server to emulate a browser. "Nothing more" doesn't quite fit. 
[12:01] sfoster: sure you could do it, I'm still not convinced you know what you are asking though. 
[12:01] sfoster: maybe start at google analytics, perhaps they have a different API you can hit, rather than the ga.js which is expressly written for browser usage
[12:02] zokko: they dont have
[12:02] TheJH: akiva, could you post your code?

[12:06] akiva: It just keeps returning me the error, and so I have tried to refer to the form string in a few ways, but bodyParser handles it fine as message[sender][email], etc.
[12:07] `3rdEden: ThomK ok
[12:07] `3rdEden: I only need get a snapshot of the log output :p
[12:08] akiva: TheJH: It only works with using [] in the name values
[12:08] akiva: So it's as though it's not compatible with the bodyParser() features. Odd, considering the example on github mentions using bodyParser()

[12:39] ThomK: http://pastie.org/2253827 something like that
[12:40] aabt has joined the channel
[12:41] TheJH: ThomK, so the reason is that the socket namespace still holds a reference to it

[12:43] kriszyp has joined the channel
[12:43] TheJH: ThomK, I think that it's a socket.io bug. could you try to manually keep tracks of which groups you join() and manually leave() them on disconnect?
[12:43] edude03 has joined the channel
[12:44] `3rdEden: TheJH he doesn't leave them on disconnect
[12:45] TheJH: `3rdEden, is it supposed to be tis way (that you have to manually leave() all groups)?
[12:45] TheJH: *this way
[12:45] ThomK: How can I "leave" them on disconnect?
[12:45] `3rdEden: use the disconnect event on the socket
[12:46] `3rdEden: and remove them from all the rooms you subscribed them to
[12:46] TheJH: ThomK, socket.on('disconnect', function() { for (var i=0; i<myRooms.length; i++) { socket.leave(myRooms[i]); }}
[12:47] TheJH: `3rdEden, it isn't supposed to be that way, is it?

[12:47] ThomK: How can I get myRooms? :>

[12:48] TheJH: ThomK, you have to manually create that list, I think. so add rooms to the list when you call join() and remove them when you call leave()
[12:48] anubhaw: does http.request requires that path to be url encoded ?
[12:49] ThomK: But that it's socket.io bug, isn't it? Why user have to deal with that? :P Socket.io should! :P

[12:50] TheJH: `3rdEden, look at http://pastie.org/pastes/2253827
[12:51] TheJH: `3rdEden, the only remaining reference is from the group
[12:52] akiva has joined the channel
[12:52] anubhaw: Shouldn't http.request take care of space separated uri params values ? or we should always pass url encoded 'path' to http.request ?
[12:53] TheJH: anubhaw, it should already be encoded. you can use the querystring module for that.

[13:09] tommyvyo has joined the channel
[13:09] ThomK: Ok, i'll try
[13:09] TheJH: rasmusbergpalm, see http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/http.html , there are various events listed
[13:10] kofno has joined the channel
[13:10] pandeiro has joined the channel
[13:10] rasmusbergpalm: TheJH: Thanks, but it does not seem to be complete. For example the req object emits an 'error' as well which is not described there
[13:11] ThomK: I'm not git guy, so it will be better to ask...
[13:11] ThomK: ranch memleak-fix set up to track remote branch memleak-fix from origin.
[13:11] ThomK: Switched to a new branch 'memleak-fix'
[13:11] ThomK: It's that ok? :P
[13:12] TheJH: rasmusbergpalm, look at the example code, there's also an error handler. If you want to be totally sure, you'll have to look at the source code.
[13:12] TheJH: ThomK, yes
[13:12] rasmusbergpalm: Ok. Cool. Thanks

[13:24] TheJH: ThomK, so that isn't the problem... hmm...
[13:24] pandeiro: but i can't find anything using the address
[13:24] TheJH: pandeiro, try/catch?
[13:24] pandeiro: so as a quick fix i'd like to just be able to code an if... statement
[13:24] pandeiro: yes or try catch
[13:25] pandeiro: so i would put the server listen statement in the body of the try?
[13:25] pandeiro: and then?
[13:25] vikstrous has joined the channel
[13:26] TheJH: pandeiro, maybe try/catch is wrong. are you calling listen() with a callback?

[15:17] gxdssoft has joined the channel
[15:17] Esteth: really? for a logout link? Thanks for the suggestion, but I don't fancy delving into jquery or nasty javascript just to let users log out. Looks like I'm just going to have to use a GET to delete the session :(

[15:23] Esteth: maybe, but that leaves me with the same problem. There's no decent way to get a client to PUT
[15:24] Esteth: The problem isn't really the tech. I can use rewriter to get DELETE/PUT forms, but users aren't going to expect a button to logout, they want a link, like every other site.
[15:24] mjr_ has joined the channel
[15:25] dpritchett: I'm afraid I don't understand, then.  What happens when you just give them a POST button to logout.  Why wouldn't that work with express like any other framework?
[15:26] Esteth: It'll work, but it screws with the user experience. Most users want to press a link that says logout. A button makes them feel like they're creating something in a form. I don't know why I asked the question now, since it's really unrelated to node.

Sometimes prepending the module name with "./node_modules/" works and sometimes modules don't need it.  Does node remember paths to calls with require and then searches in there as necessary?

[17:17] Aikar: jeromegn: it really depends on making sure your code is written in a way to support different environments with ease, then setup a deployment system that can push the code to diff environments (maybe auto generate configs if needed). i personally prefer to never rely on a full path in configs (always relative from a base install) which is a good first step, but stuff like domains for diff 'branch environments' etc really relies down to a sys admin level of work.
[17:17] othiym23 has joined the channel
[17:18] qbert_ has joined the channel
[17:19] Aikar: the way we do it at work (although PHP) is VM's spawn up from a base, then we install debian packages to them, then run a postinstall script to determine what the domains should be for the configs and paths, then start it up.
[17:19] sonnym has joined the channel
[17:20] jeromegn: Aikar: yea, I get that. Currently reading this: http://blog.clock.co.uk/2011/04/11/deploying-node-js-apps/ looks like a decent deployment solution
[17:20] qbert_: question for the room, do you guys like node's package system / require ?  
[17:20] xandrews has joined the channel
[17:22] xtianw: qbert_:  Yep.
[17:22] jeromegn: zer0-: chekc this out: http://blog.clock.co.uk/2011/04/11/deploying-node-js-apps/
[17:23] qbert_: xtianw, you like that require returns something, rather than just including a file for referening the classes / functions in that file ?
[17:23] fille: a soap implementation 
[17:23] fille: soap-client 
[17:23] Aikar: jeromegn: ah, well most of the work is really outside of node.js itself. making sure the environment creation process is easy (if you go with the idea of environment for the branch for working with multiple teams/stories at once). but then getting code to the server, a way to generate configs with varying ports if your talking bout multiple apps o nsame box, and starting it
[17:25] jeromegn: Aikar: yea I guess I'm just looking for a reliable way to push to production effortlessly (git push origin master). needs to be able to npm install stuff, stop the old instance, start the new one ("without" downtime) and possibly start other services (node.js worker instance and stuff like that)
[17:25] qbert_: oh its a commonjs thing
[17:25] Aikar: we have like 5 teams at work with multiple devs on each, so we have an environment per branch.
[17:25] explodes: Should I use http.Client for an HTTP Client... or is it deprecated/broken etc. It isn't in the documentation: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.9/api/all.html

[17:26] fattytuna has joined the channel

[17:26] Aikar: jeromegn: i really recommend building a 'package' that includes all dependencies, and that package should just be droppable in destination server (production) and then update link to latest ver. so install all dependencies and generate configs on the 'deployment' server, then just push it to production and restart the node process

[18:01] Country has joined the channel

[18:03] japj: isaacs: if you see ryah, can you ask him to tag the 0.5.2 release and update node_version.h in master? ;)
[18:03] tjholowaychuk: libraries should definitely namespace appropriately but as far as your own app stuff goes, go nuts

[18:03] onar has joined the channel
[18:03] isaacs: japj: sure.
[18:03] isaacs: qbert_: one *could* implement something like python's "from blah import bloo" (but in JS syntax of course) using NODE_MODULE_CONTEXTS and global pollution.
[18:04] isaacs: since then the "global" would just be for that one module anyway
[18:04] isaacs_ has joined the channel
[18:05] jakehow has joined the channel
[18:05] qbert_: Ill grep for that :)
[18:05] isaacs_: but that gets complicated.  "if (er instanceof Error)" will fail, "global" is no longer "really" global, etc.
[18:05] qbert_: wait I lost you
[18:05] isaacs_: qbert_: set NODE_MODULE_CONTEXTS=1 in the environment, and node will spin up a separate JS context for every module.
[18:05] isaacs_: qbert_: but now my "Array" isn't the same object as your "Array"
[18:06] isaacs_: qbert_: /*a.js*/ exports.a = [];  /* b.js */  assert(require("a.js").a instanceof Array) // fail
[18:06] qbert_: I see :/
[18:06] dgathright has joined the channel
[18:06] isaacs_: Array in particular has the Array.isArray() function, but there's no Error.isError().  if you're walking up a prototype chain looking for Object.prototype, it's going to fail, and so on
[18:07] tjholowaychuk: ACTION hates instanceof
[18:07] isaacs_: the JS language has grown up with a shared consistent global context throughout a process, and breaking it causes odd gotchas.

[18:40] tjholowaychuk: ggg: app.use(connect.static(__dirname + '/public'))
[18:41] mscdex: ekryski: you mean database modules?
[18:41] ekryski: nope. The actual db. ie. I would like to specify that I am using mongodb: 1.8.x
[18:41] ggg: if im using the routeur module... 
[18:41] altamic has joined the channel
[18:42] tjholowaychuk: ggg router is being removed
[18:42] tjholowaychuk: but that doesnt matter
[18:42] mscdex: ekryski: there's no way to define system package dependencies like that in npm
[18:42] tjholowaychuk: that's how you would serve statics
[18:42] rex_fernando has joined the channel
[18:42] mscdex: ekryski: you just have to include those kind of requirements in the readme or somewhere similar
[18:42] mscdex: ekryski: or the package description
[18:43] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[18:43] ggg: how will I route my urls ?
[18:43] ekryski: mscdex: ya I did mean the package.json file
[18:43] tjholowaychuk: using a third-party routing middleware or something like express
[18:43] ggg: I want to follow RESTful prinicples, and use connect
[18:43] vikstrous has joined the channel
[18:44] tbranyen: is there anything other than express?
[18:44] mscdex: tbranyen: there can be only one!
[18:44] ggg: what is the alternative to router tj ?
[18:44] ekryski: but I guess npm won't actually do anything with it.  It'll just be like "Hey we are using mongo 1.8.x"
[18:44] tjholowaychuk: ggg: I've seen a few around, not sure if theyare in the wiki
[18:44] tbranyen: mscdex: that's basically what i figured :-p
[18:44] tjholowaychuk: tbranyen i think most peopel just build on express
[18:44] tjholowaychuk: there's almost no reason not to
[18:45] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: yeah i was being *insert word where you are being intentionally dumb to be funny*
[18:45] ggg: i think illl give express a shot then
[18:45] mscdex: ekryski: yeah you'd have something like that in your module's package.json's description field, that it uses mongo 1.8.x
[18:46] ekryski: mscdex: so in package.json would I just use "db": "mongodb"?
[18:46] tjholowaychuk: ggg: if you try it and have questions we are in #express
[18:46] ggg: ok, thank you tj
[18:46] mscdex: ekryski: maybe there is a way to have a bash script that checks for the presence of mongo on the system and checks the version first

[18:46] mikl has joined the channel
[18:47] ekryski: hmm that's not a bad idea
[18:47] mscdex: ekryski: either way, i'd at least have a blurb about it in your package's description field
[18:47] dpritchett: ekryski, here's a python project that aborts if it doesnt detect the proper mongo version: http://www.tnrglobal.com/blog/2010/05/how-to-get-the-mongodb-server-version-using-pymongo/
[18:48] dpritchett: does your mongo library give you a version check from within node?
[18:48] namelessnotion has joined the channel
[18:48] ekryski: I'm using mongoose but I'm not too sure actually
[18:50] jacobolus has joined the channel
[18:50] mscdex: if there's a command-line tool that comes with mongo that you can use to check the version, you could add a script that checks that version and fails to install the package if it's not at least 1.8.x
[18:50] peol: Hey, does anyone know of a simple way to circumvent "error: variable 'receiver' set but not used [-Werror=unused-but-set-variable]" when building with gcc 4.6.*, or can I disable that flag for the V8 build somehow?
[18:50] mscdex: you can do that with the 'scripts' section of package.json: https://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/doc/scripts.md

[20:49] guidocalvano: cocoa requires objective c

[20:53] mikeal has joined the channel
[20:53] guidocalvano: because I have to link v8 into any code that uses v8
[20:54] guidocalvano: and if I do use waf, then it complains that it can't compile objective c
[20:54] guidocalvano: so how do I get waf to compile objective c?
[20:54] kartmetal: guidocalvano, any hope you could compile your ogre code as a dll without hooking into node?
[20:54] guidocalvano: objective c isn't mentioned in waf-book 1.5
[20:54] shanebo: jerrysv, all seems to be installed fine without errors, however when I try to run a js file via node test.js, I get a "command not found" error
[20:55] kartmetal: then build a tiny module that can compile with node-waf that dynamically links into your big DLL?
[20:55] jerkelens: @tjholowaychuk Good Afternoon. We have been using tobi for a while now. We just wiped out our node_modules folder to refresh everything and now we are getting an error from htmlparser inside of jsdom. We were wondering if you had seen this.
[20:55] guidocalvano: kartmetal: I did that, and then linked it to a node module
[20:55] guidocalvano: kartmetal: but then that required linking v8 into node
[20:55] tjholowaychuk: jerkelens: hmmm no I haven't had that
[20:56] kartmetal: weird. v8 is already in node.
[20:56] guidocalvano: kartmetal: and then when I finally linked the dylib into node and ran my app I got segfaults
[20:56] jerrysv: shanebo: and you did a sudo make install?
[20:56] shanebo: jerrysv yes
[20:57] guidocalvano: kartmetal: if I want to create a dylib without node-waf, then it needs to link to v8
[20:57] m0s has joined the channel
[20:57] jerrysv: shanebo: i see, you're installing in your local path
[20:57] jerrysv: shanebo: try echo $PATH
[20:57] motaro has joined the channel
[20:57] jerrysv: shanebo: and see if that is actually in your current path
[20:57] guidocalvano: kartmetal: and if i then link that dylib to my node module, then i get segfaults when I call GetFuntion in v8
[20:58] guidocalvano: kartmetal: if I on the other hand use node-waf to build, then I can't get it to compile objective c
[20:58] kartmetal: I'd think you'd need to keep v8 out of your ogre DLLs..
[20:58] rauchg has joined the channel
[20:59] kartmetal: basically have an ogre/objective C- only DLL
[20:59] guidocalvano: kartmetal: but how do I create a dylib that uses v8 then? 
[20:59] kartmetal: then have your node extension link into that.
[20:59] kartmetal: only the node extension would do v8 calls

[21:00] kartmetal: mind you, I'm not entirely sure that'd work.. but on paper, it seems reasonable.
[21:00] shanebo: jerrysv, I'm not sure what you mean by "current path"
[21:00] guidocalvano: kartmetal: that is perhaps an option, but it would create a build system that will be *hell* to work with
[21:00] BennyBorn: hey guys, is it possible that the dgram module is still missing in the latest windows binary?
[21:01] kartmetal: well.. two steps to build instead of one, yes.
[21:01] kysmith has joined the channel
[21:01] kartmetal: and probably more recompile than ideal.
[21:01] guidocalvano: kartmetal: and most importantly more cr$p to manage
[21:01] kartmetal: there might be a smarter way to do this I don't know about.
[21:02] guidocalvano: bottomline is; why can't I tell node-waf to use gcc-4.2
[21:03] jerrysv: shanebo: if all of that went well, it should be in ~/local/bin
[21:03] jerrysv: shanebo: what does ls ~/local/bin tell you?

[22:53] TheJH: !mem greet TooTallNate
[22:53] jhbot: Hello TooTallNate!
[22:53] Marak: "
[22:53] Marak: but that added an extra empty key pair
[22:54] Marak: tjholowaychuk: thats not an object though
[22:54] Marak: tjholowaychuk: its pretty important for what im doing to maintain those types
[22:54] tjholowaychuk: yeah i know. that's just kinda the nature of the semantics everyone has placed on the querystring
[22:54] Marak: tjholowaychuk: i cant even imagine would it "should" look like anyway
[22:54] Marak: regardless of the qs parsing code
[22:54] Marak: i dont even know how you'd represent it
[22:55] tjholowaychuk: yeah no clue anything you wanted i guess
[22:55] tjholowaychuk: hell a querystring could just be "foo:bar,bar:baz" if you wanted

[22:58] shanebo: jerrysv, do you know if brew install node will be bleeding edge or stable release?
[22:58] mikey_p: should be stable
[22:59] shanebo: if http://nodejs.org/dist/node-v0.4.10.tar.gz is the stable one, then yes it does
[23:00] mikey_p: pretty sure that brew only includes stable anything, unless you're using a fork
[23:00] shanebo: good to know, thanks mikey_p
[23:01] Murvin: TheJH: Regarding the decryption problem.  I am still unable to repo it with a simple example.   (which is about decryption affect the httpserver).  however, in my simple sample, I get another problem.  decryption doesn't decrypt everything.  the last characters become funny characters.
[23:02] Murvin: TheJH:  I will post the code up in the issue.
[23:02] TheJH: Murvin, link to the isue?

[23:08] kasper: shanebo:  scroll down to the part about 'Installing npm' 
[23:08] shanebo: k thanks
[23:09] TheJH: Murvin, I think that this line is wrong:
[23:09] TheJH: encryptedText =  new Buffer(encryptOutput1, 'binary').toString('base64') + new Buffer(encryptOutput2, 'binary').toString('base64');
[23:10] TheJH: Murvin, first concat the buffers, then create the base64 string
[23:11] Murvin: TheJH: let me try.. i did that before new Buffer(encryptOutput1+encryptOutpu2);  let me use that one

[23:12] esteth: Does anyone have any experience with jasmine as a test framework? my test appears to be passing, but I've somehow not understood how to use asyncSpecWait / asyncSpecDone, and I get a timeout error so my spec fails.
[23:12] Murvin: TheJH: you are right.  
[23:12] TheJH: Murvin, try this: https://gist.github.com/1f3ea69ebde10602ec23
[23:12] TheJH: Murvin, ah, ok
[23:13] shanebo: kasper, all good thanks!
[23:13] Murvin: TheJH:  that fix.  however still trying to figure out how come in my real app, which use encrypt1+encrypt2.. will hang when doing decryption with calling teh final() function.  but work with dont call that function
[23:13] kasper: shanebo: great! :)
[23:15] Murvin: TheJH:  should I do what the post said.. or just do this:  new Buffer( encrypt1 + encrypt2)  will do the same thing?
[23:16] TheJH: Murvin, I think that you need the code in my gist
[23:17] kasper: when doing this: var exec = require('child_process').exec; exec("ping -c 2 -W 30 localhost", clearping); is it possible to send additional arguments to the callback to when the callback gets executed?
[23:17] shanebo: kasper, this may be a stupid question, but is there a way to setup a local vhost to serve up local urls without starting the server (shanebo ducks)

[23:18] kasper: shanebo: I am not sure i understand, but you can open up your /etc/hosts and add your vhosts and point them to 127.0.0.1
[23:20] shanebo: kasper so if I'm listening at .listen(8124, "127.0.0.1"), what could I add in /etc/hosts to hit the site at say foo.local?
[23:21] Xeon06_ has joined the channel
[23:22] kasper: shanebo: 127.0.0.1 foo.local

[23:24] DrPizza: oh c'mon, who checks binaries into version control.
[23:24] Murvin: TheJH: ok.
[23:25] TheJH: Murvin, I think that your "+" will implicitly convert the buffers into strings or so

[23:34] shanebo: kasper, re: 127.0.0.1 foo.local, what would the middle man be to point to the directory/files – since apache configs aren't used?
[23:35] kasper: Oh.. You are using node with apache? I don't how that works, sorry
[23:35] shanebo: oh no, not using apache with node. that would defeat the purpose :D
[23:36] shanebo: however usually I setup vhosts for local projects

[23:37] shanebo: kasper so your workflow is to start the site every time you want to hit it locally?
[23:38] aaroninfidel: Hi there, I'm trying to get express working in node.js, I've installed node via brew, and installed express via npm, and then when I try to run an express project in node, it says it cannot find the express module.
[23:38] jerrysv: shanebo: back again, you up and running? (and sorry, i don't use brew)
[23:38] eee_c has joined the channel
[23:38] shanebo: jerrysv, I'm running now!
[23:38] kasper: shanebo: i start the node process everytime i need to test yes
[23:38] jerrysv: shanebo: awesome!
[23:38] TheJH: aaroninfidel, did you run the npm install command in which your script is?
[23:39] jerrysv: mikey_p: i hear there's a group of folks in town - you going to make it anywhere this weekend?
[23:39] TheJH: aaroninfidel, npm install does NOT install globally
[23:39] shanebo: jerrysv but I'm trying to figure out if there's an equivalent in node to setup local urls so that I can avoid starting the server in terminal every time.
[23:39] kasper: but i have looked at something like this http://fgnass.posterous.com/nodejs-supervisor which restarts the process when the files changes
[23:39] aaroninfidel: TheJH: even when using sudo?
[23:39] Murvin: TheJH: I think the initial problem is how the encrypt text are base64...   actually new Buffer (encrypt1+encrypt2) works.  but not buffer + buffer nor the way you post..
[23:39] mikey_p: maybe, I'm caught up with family coming in middle of the week, running a booth at oscon, and a couple of sprints
[23:39] TheJH: aaroninfidel, yes
[23:39] mikey_p: jerrysv: almost all drupal related stuff :(
[23:39] jerrysv: mikey_p: possibility of a small hackathon tonight
[23:40] jerrysv: mikey_p: sorry man, saw those drupal oscon posts come through -- i take it you volunteered?
[23:40] mikey_p: actually i'm helping coordinate part of it
[23:40] jerrysv: mikey_p: even worse :)
[23:41] mikey_p: jerrysv: I wish I could find a way to make it work, may not even make it to the meetup next week
[23:42] jerrysv: doh
[23:42] aaroninfidel: TheJH: So, I've just run npm install express with sudo, inside of the directory I want, then ran express, and then ran node app.js and still getting the same error.

[23:48] beriberikix: How do you check NODE_PATHS in 0.5.2 since require.paths is deprecated?
[23:48] isaacs: beriberikix: you can look at require("module").globalPaths (but changing it does nothing)
[23:48] aaroninfidel: TheJH: npm doesn't have that command.
[23:48] Murvin: ooo
[23:48] Murvin: hahah
[23:49] Murvin: but. take a look, if my point is valid too.
[23:49] isaacs: beriberikix: or you can check process.env.NODE_PATH directly, of course

[23:51] TheJH: aaroninfidel, that version of npm is ancient
[23:51] beriberikix: thanks for that fix :)
[23:52] aaroninfidel: TheJH: ok, so... how should I update it? I've only been using brew to update it.
[23:52] TheJH: !mem npm-install
