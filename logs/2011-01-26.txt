[00:00] pr2012: tjholowaychuk- a issue with express-contrib 0.3.3, Cannot call method 'concat' of undefined
[00:00] pr2012:     at Object.<anonymous> (/usr/local/lib/node/.npm/express-contrib/0.3.3/package/lib/express-contrib/namespace.js:48:24)
[00:00] pr2012: looks like versioning from what I read in a forum
[00:01] tjholowaychuk: what version of express are you using?
[00:01] tjholowaychuk: it relies on a newer connect
[00:02] tjholowaychuk: well that one specific module does

[00:06] Ikaros: Hey - is there a way to get sub-millisecond timing in node? I'm trying to optimise something but console.time just reports 0ms
[00:07] mscdex: that's some optimization
[00:07] softdrink: can you do the operation many more times and average it?
[00:07] Ikaros: Well its in a loop and I need it to run as many times as possible
[00:07] Ikaros: That might work
[00:08] Evet_ has joined the channel
[00:08] riven has joined the channel
[00:09] Ikaros: But the short answer is node doesn't support sub-millisecond timing?
[00:09] pr2012: tjholowaychuk im using 1.0.3
[00:09] tjholowaychuk: pr2012: try updating connect
[00:09] softdrink: not that i'm aware of

[00:18] torvalamo: i could use someone to proof read for me
[00:18] softdrink: hehe
[00:18] gkatsev: ACTION heads home
[00:19] softdrink: i have a 3 year old boy and twin 2 year old girls… none of which talk… but damn you should see one of them play angry birds.
[00:20] tmzt: they read?
[00:20] softdrink: tmzt:  not that i'm aware of
[00:20] softdrink: doubt it though
[00:21] softdrink: they all really really love to flip through books that have animals in them though
[00:21] tmzt: so, I'm looking for an infrastructure that makes building a new site as easy as possible
[00:21] fairwinds: mscdex: found that I can use api. An going to do a lookup of countries using http://api.geonames.org/countryInfoJSON?username=demo. An use geonameId for country selected to provide list of subdivisions using query like http://api.geonames.org/childrenJSON?formatted=true&geonameId=6251999&username=demo
[00:21] tmzt: but is clean and fun to work with once it's built the scaffold
[00:21] tmzt: using node.js
[00:21] mscdex: fairwinds: cool
[00:21] ceej has joined the channel
[00:21] softdrink: tmzt:  site or app?
[00:21] torvalamo: sammy.js client side
[00:22] tmzt: app which is also a site
[00:22] tmzt: I'm using sammy but parts of it don't work very well so I'm back to serving static pages
[00:22] torvalamo: hm i wonder if angular.js has come along
[00:22] tmzt: now I'm looking at backend which seems to have a nice way of handling collections
[00:22] softdrink: i've been hacking out a 100% client-side app for usability testing, built with ActiveJS and MooTools
[00:23] tmzt: but I want to use something like jeditable for editing but with grid support without limited the flexibility of the html (so not dojo)
[00:23] softdrink: I've been using ActiveRoutes and ActiveRecord from ActiveJS… pretty easy to use
[00:24] softdrink: i'm not 100% sold on either one though, but they're handy

[00:56] phed__: hi
[00:56] jesusabdullah: k04n: You can probably find the pieces in different areas, though. For instance, there's a few chat room examples you could probably glean some useful information from
[00:56] phed__: is there any problems with using "ajax" against any other port than the source html?
[00:56] jesusabdullah: You may also find socket.io and dnode useful for communication between things
[00:57] desaiu: what is this session({ secret: 'foo' }) and where does it go?

[00:59] jesusabdullah: phed__: Yeah, I think so? I just got confuzzled by your question. Tbh, I probably don't know the answer, though.
[00:59] jesusabdullah: Oddly enough, I usually don't do web programming with node!
[00:59] arpegius has joined the channel
[01:00] phed__: jesusabdullah: well, i have had issues when deploying such things earlier
[01:00] phed__: but that was, ehm, ages ago
[01:00] phed__: before node.js; using twisted
[01:00] bingomanatee: okay - I'm having problems getting the noogle to keep running after I close my terminal window. 
[01:01] bingomanatee: I type node index.js & 
[01:01] phed__: now i want to go node.js + twisted; but still want the app to talk to the twisted install on another port
[01:01] bingomanatee: but when I close the terminal it goes down.

[01:01] jesusabdullah: The only thing I know about ajax is that you can't do ye standard ajax with a server other than the one that the page came from. Idk about ports, though.
[01:01] phed__: jesusabdullah: ok, that's the big question i guess
[01:02] phed__: jesusabdullah: ports, i mean
[01:02] tim_smart: ryah: https://gist.github.com/405862927250d966b31a
[01:02] tim_smart: This is after a `make distclean && ./configure && make && sudo make install`
[01:02] phed__: jesusabdullah: it might be that in the deployment sitaution where ports _seemed_ to make a difference it was a complex frontend apache install
[01:02] tim_smart: Latest master using GCC
[01:03] phed__: jesusabdullah: but i'd love a definite answer - any idea where i can ask?
[01:03] phed__: jesusabdullah: i read through tons of spec without a definitive answer :\
[01:04] jesusabdullah: phed__: #node.js is actually a pretty good place to ask, usually; Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like the smart people are here. ;) Like I said, I'm not much of a web guy.
[01:04] jesusabdullah: phed__: Maybe try asking again in a few hours?

[01:05] phed__: errrr that's sorta too funny

[01:06] phed__: (for the sake of question, when i tried to ask apache to do it, it failed miserably)
[01:06] jesusabdullah: What do you mean by _proper_?
[01:07] jesusabdullah: You can proxy with node
[01:07] jesusabdullah: A lot of people use nginx for proxying, though
[01:07] jesusabdullah: they throw nginx on the front and proxy requests to multiple node instances
[01:07] jesusabdullah: At least, that's one way to do it
[01:07] phed__: basically, what apache did was to wait for the webpage to end its feed (in case of, eh, not-done-yet-feeds), before it proxied it forward
[01:07] phed__: making it useless for longrunning connections
[01:08] jesusabdullah: It's also possible with apache. There was an article in either /r/node or /r/javascript about it, should still be in the first few pages
[01:08] phed__: yeah, i guess the term is streaming proxy
[01:08] jashkenas has joined the channel
[01:08] phed__: ok, cool
[01:08] duomark has left the channel
[01:09] phed__: point is that the endless amount of proxyconfigs i tried would block in the most unixy way possible
[01:09] phed__: but cool, then i can at least try some different configs - but it will add some overhead :\
[01:10] phed__: I guess I could somehow config a twisted-web to handle out stuff to node.js in a transparent manner
[01:13] phed__: OR if I deem the twisted server to require low-latency to communicate with the node.js through UNIX-ports (if that's possible) or any other RPC mechanism 
[01:15] phed__: jesusabdullah: does nginx really handle streaming sockets?
[01:15] phed__: ie websockets

[01:15] jesusabdullah: phed__: I can't tell you from experience, unfortunately, but given its popularity I would imagine so

[02:43] tim_smart: Hm
[02:43] slickplaid: hrm... redis_node or node-redis, which to choose...
[02:43] ryah: the big function that wraps each module is apparently throwing node into the bad case
[02:43] tim_smart: slickplaid: node-redis if you don't need pub sub (I haven't implemented it yet) and want something super fast. Otherwise redis_node.
[02:44] tmzt: yeah, what is that used for? there's no way to create a new context in v8 api?
[02:44] tokumine has joined the channel
[02:44] slickplaid: I went with redis_node last time, so I'll go with node-redis this time... Thanks tim_smart :D
[02:44] tim_smart: tmzt: You just have to pass a flag and it will switch to using contexts.

[04:19] chapel: SubStack

[04:20] bingomanatee: I'm self-studying ruby - maybe I can RoR Fishbook.net
[04:20] SubStack: chapel: you can pass your own stream to dnode
[04:21] chapel: yeah I know
[04:21] SubStack: it can be udp or whatever
[04:21] keks: bingomanatee: or, like, snailbook
[04:21] bingomanatee: "Fishbook.net: over 1,200,000,000 users, most of them plankton.

[04:24] slickplaid: bingomanatee: https://github.com/robrighter/node-boilerplate/blob/master/server.js after line 71, add another variable && on https://github.com/robrighter/node-boilerplate/blob/master/views/index.ejs try to use that new variable... any idea why it won't work?
[04:24] chapel: SubStack: I was thinking, how you have /dnode.js for the browser, how hard would it be to use a similar technique to send ajax view code to the browser that mirrors your servers views like in express/connect?

[04:30] fangel has joined the channel
[04:31] chapel: well my initial thought would be just to use dnode and something like sammy.js or backbone.js and just override their view logic so that it does an ajax call first and is returned the data to render

[04:36] SubStack: chapel: depends mostly on how hard it is to hack around the view rendering I suspect
[04:36] chapel: yeah SubStack
[04:37] chapel: pyrotechnick: sammy is fairly simple in comparison to backbone
[04:37] chapel: mvc versus basically just views
[04:37] chapel: just an idea SubStack
[04:38] chapel: I mean, if it were simpler to handle ajax views, and also have standard non-js views supported out of the box
[04:38] chapel: that would be pretty slick
[04:38] chapel: not have to write two sets of code
[04:38] chapel: of course you can simplify the ends depending on how you do things

[05:36] hij1nx has joined the channel

[05:40] creationix: that would be a browser bug right?
[05:40] creationix: I mean, content-length is for the unencrypted data
[05:40] creationix: you can't even read the content-length without decrypting the stream
[05:41] cloudhead: that's true
[05:41] creationix: unless node uses your user-specified content length to do something funny
[05:41] cloudhead: and chunked doesnt have a length
[05:41] cloudhead: are you using chunked?
[05:41] creationix: but I'm pretty sure node ignores most the headers
[05:41] creationix: the only way to do chunked is to not set a content-length
[05:41] creationix: I thought so at least
[05:41] cloudhead: yea
[05:42] ericnakagawa has joined the channel
[05:42] cloudhead: are you setting the content-length?

[05:43] creationix: I can try that

[05:50] zzak: gzip maybe?
[05:50] creationix: no, no gzipping
[05:51] creationix: bingomanatee: it's my twitter stream from a while back
[05:51] creationix: fed the rss into the wordle generator
[05:51] mechanate has joined the channel
[05:51] zzak: are you using the updated https node?
[05:51] creationix: zzak, yeah, it's node v0.3.6
[05:51] micheil: maybe try at @head
[05:52] sechrist has joined the channel
[05:52] creationix: I was supposedly working somewhere around 0.3.4, so should be plenty new enough
[05:52] ROBOTARMY has joined the channel
[05:52] pyrotechnick: what's with the new v8
[05:53] Matt__ has joined the channel
[05:53] pyrotechnick: it doesn't like continues and returns in certain structs
[05:53] pyrotechnick: mongoose fails on it because of continues and returns
[05:53] chapel: creationix: I haven't tried it since 0.3.3 but https client wasn't working, would only send 60k of data before just dying
[05:53] creationix: pyrotechnick: see the changelog
[05:53] pyrotechnick: has anyone actually looked at the code for mongoose?
[05:53] pyrotechnick: it's bizaar
[05:53] creationix: they added a check to refuse invalid continues and returns
[05:53] fangel has joined the channel
[05:54] creationix: yeah, the client was just now finished, but the server should have been working for some time
[05:54] mjr_: Has anybody tested the https server in 0.3 lately?
[05:54] sechrist has joined the channel
[05:54] mjr_: ryah thinks that it works.
[05:54] creationix: mjr_: I'm trying
[05:54] creationix: cloudhead says it works for him
[05:54] mjr_: But I've not heard of anybody doing rigorous testing.
[05:54] mjr_: Cool.
[05:54] rburhum has joined the channel

[05:55] zzak: odd
[05:56] sechrist has joined the channel
[05:56] mjr_: creationix: still?
[05:56] creationix: yep, here is my server http://creationix.com/server.js
[05:56] creationix: exact same request handler, works fine for http, gets stuck for https
[05:57] sechrist has joined the channel
[05:57] ryah: creationix: good to know
[05:57] creationix: ok, trying with HEAD now...
[05:57] ryah: hm, i would really like to get a way to repeat that....
[05:58] ryah: shoul di just try serving a big file?
[05:58] micheil: test/pummel
[05:58] creationix: same problem still https://creationix.com:8433/wordle.jpg
[05:58] creationix: it pauses with both fs.readFile buffering all the content and with piping a readStream
[06:00] patrickarlt has joined the channel
[06:00] Utkarsh_ has joined the channel
[06:00] zzak: creationix: does it have to be synchronous readFile?
[06:01] creationix: zzak: the sync readfile is just to get my cert
[06:01] creationix: the actual jpg is normal async reading
[06:01] zzak: ahh
[06:01] pyrotechnick has joined the channel
[06:02] skm has joined the channel
[06:02] zzak: gotcha, see that in simple/test-htps-simple.js too
[06:02] cloudhead: creationix: I tried with pipe, seems to work fine here
[06:02] cloudhead: but my images aren't that big
[06:02] cloudhead: gonna try with something bigger
[06:02] creationix: try with my wordle
[06:02] cloudhead: ok
[06:03] creationix: get it from port 80 or 433, those work fine
[06:03] cloudhead: yar
[06:03] creationix: (433 is behind an stunnel)

[06:08] Coal has joined the channel
[06:08] zzak: ahh
[06:08] creationix: looks like readStream chunks are 64kb
[06:09] creationix: tmzt: sorry, I don't support wheat much, did you install with npm?
[06:10] tmzt: no, submodule I can install with npm though
[06:10] creationix: also I think it only works with node 0.2.x
[06:10] creationix: it just works for me and I don't mess with it

[06:11] dgathright has joined the channel
[06:11] creationix: ryah, cloudhead: did either of you reproduce my http problem?
[06:11] tmzt: hmm, the how to node checkout worked fine
[06:12] creationix: tmzt: yeah, it has some pretty terrible error handling
[06:12] tmzt: yeah like it does nothing if there's an error
[06:12] creationix: a single typo in a markdown file will cause flat out errors with no message
[06:12] tmzt: I'll look into what it's doing
[06:12] creationix: tmzt: sorry about that
[06:12] tmzt: it's cool, it looks awesome
[06:12] tmzt: most of my site is jade though not haml
[06:12] creationix: I really wish I had time to rewrite wheat
[06:12] creationix: clean up the code, make it a modular framework
[06:13] tmzt: the git-fs stuff is cool, using git directly like that
[06:13] tmzt: sure, I'm might just plug renderers.js into an express routing setup instead
[06:13] creationix: that could be neat
[06:14] creationix: feel free to torture the code, it's meant to be an example, not a framework
[06:14] tmzt: certainly, I just was trying to get the blog. portion of my site up quickly ;)
[06:15] creationix: tmzt: supposedly, the entire wheat module can be used as an express module
[06:15] creationix: I've never tried though
[06:15] cloudhead: creationix: yea
[06:15] cloudhead: creationix: so I think it has to do with pipe
[06:15] zzak: yah eventually ill think of something to do with my no.de haha, already have a blog :/
[06:15] creationix: cloudhead: yay, I'm not going crazy
[06:15] cloudhead: cause I can't get any images to show up when I use pipe
[06:16] creationix: cloudhead: then why did it crap out when I used fs.readFile?
[06:16] creationix: or was my browser caching the bad result? hmm...
[06:16] cloudhead: yea
[06:16] cloudhead: make sure you shift+refresh
[06:16] ROBOTARMY has joined the channel
[06:16] creationix: I was using curl too

[06:16] creationix: doubt that caches much
[06:16] cloudhead: yea
[06:16] cloudhead: hmm
[06:17] creationix: interesting, the browser is making range requests for the jpg
[06:18] creationix: I didn't know they could do that
[06:18] creationix: I guess it's trying to resume the download
[06:18] zzak: https://github.com/ry/node/blob/master/test/simple/test-fs-read-stream.js#L89
[06:18] creationix: zzak: nice, 1 byte chunks
[06:19] sechrist has joined the channel
[06:20] tim_smart has joined the channel
[06:22] creationix: cloudhead: yep, I can confirm that with fs.readFile, I'm calling res.end(data) with 117865 bytes and the curl client is only getting 16384 bytes
[06:22] creationix: and the Content-Length header is correct at 117865
[06:23] creationix: hence the hanging client
[06:23] creationix: I don't think pump is to blame
[06:25] mdoan has left the channel
[06:25] sechrist has joined the channel
[06:26] creationix: interestingly, I get farther when using pipe than readFile
[06:26] creationix: the clients gets to 26627 bytes before pausing
[06:27] creationix: and if I request the file from localhost on my server, it gets all 115k
[06:27] creationix: ryah: ^^^
[06:27] creationix: that's going to make it harder to test
[06:28] creationix: you have to overload the client before it will get confused and stop sending data
[06:28] nejucomo has joined the channel
[06:28] zzak: can you just do a regular ssl request?
[06:28] creationix: zzak: telnet over ssl?

[06:29] sechrist has joined the channel

[06:30] dekz has joined the channel
[06:30] dekz: anyone know how well the audio tags work with a local file that is still being written to?

[06:30] creationix: my server is in Texas, I'm in California
[06:31] shiawuen has joined the channel
[06:31] zzak: even an empty request?
[06:31] creationix: what do you mean empty request?
[06:31] creationix: I'm doing a plain HTTP GET
[06:31] sechrist has joined the channel
[06:31] zzak: sorry, meant response
[06:32] zzak: without the wordle
[06:32] creationix: yeah, that works fine
[06:32] creationix: it only gets stuck on large bodies
[06:32] zzak: just to confirm the ssl is working properly

[06:33] creationix: zzak: the exact same code (even the same instance of the request handler in memory) works fine for http, but not for https
[06:33] creationix: so it's not the server logic
[06:35] zzak: hmm, just for fun im gonna try to run the HEAD tests with a larger buffersize
[06:36] shiawuen: how about response.end with big chunk of text? maybe it's something to do with serving images?
[06:36] creationix: shiawuen: doubt it, it's all just bits at this layer

[06:52] creationix: cloudhead: no, havePending was set before the loop

[07:29] creationix: cygwin
[07:30] creationix: bnitica: note especially the /etc and /tmp folders on the ajaxorg repo, those are required for some things to work on windows
[07:30] pkrumins: soon there will be native
[07:30] creationix: pkrumins: that will be awesome
[07:30] pkrumins: at least ryah said so!
[07:31] pkrumins: i will use it for my awesome new world changing windows app framework
[07:31] bnitica: ok, thank you, I'll try it
[07:31] SubStack: still a long slog getting stuff to compile in windows for npm packages
[07:32] pkrumins: could do it like strawberry perl does!
[07:32] pkrumins: ships with mingw
[07:32] pkrumins: oh could be troublesome still
[07:32] pkrumins: yes trouble.
[07:32] creationix: yeah, I'm using node with cygwin dlls
[07:32] creationix: it works, but not well
[07:33] creationix: and paths are wonky
[07:33] pkrumins: so how is it in general
[07:33] pkrumins: can be used in practice?
[07:33] SubStack: maybe some add-on for npm for binary dll blobs
[07:33] pkrumins: or just to play around?
[07:33] creationix: I don't to native extensions, so that's not  a problem for me
[07:33] SubStack: and a build server and a pony
[07:33] pkrumins: SubStack: almost impossible
[07:34] pkrumins: SubStack: disregard that. 
[07:34] evanmeagher: can anyone suggest any code to check out for learning how to "properly" use streams for file downloading?
[07:34] evanmeagher: i'm wanting to add stream support for my dropbox api wrapper
[07:34] pkrumins: evanmeagher: how do you do it now?
[07:35] evanmeagher: hit the dropbox API directly and return file contents in a callback
[07:35] evanmeagher: would suck for huge files
[07:35] pkrumins: well doesn't it call 'data' event repeatedly?
[07:36] sechrist has joined the channel
[07:37] sechrist has joined the channel
[07:37] evanmeagher: well, to be more precise, it's using a get request through node-oauth
[07:38] evanmeagher: pkrumins: the way I have it now works, as far as I know. I had a feature req for stream support though, so I'm looking into it
[07:38] sechrist has joined the channel
[07:38] pkrumins: well you just have to listen on 'data' events somehow and save chunks that you get to file, that's it./2

[07:49] mscdex: heh
[07:49] pkrumins: chapel: emm, not sure how to explain
[07:49] Fenda: mscdex: SubStack: my system structure would be: browser requests page from apache server, apache requests related data from nodejs and uses this to build the page returned to the user
[07:50] AAA_awright has joined the channel
[07:50] pkrumins: chapel: you'd have a http.ClientResponse, which is a Stream
[07:50] micheil: mscdex: those adobe guys must love recursion
[07:50] chapel: yes
[07:50] pkrumins: chapel: and you'd .on('data', function (chunk) { ... })
[07:50] chapel: response was the word
[07:50] chapel: yeah
[07:50] pkrumins: chapel: write that chunk to disk.
[07:50] chapel: and each chunk is a buffer
[07:50] pkrumins: yep
[07:50] chapel: I know that bit
[07:50] chapel: done that many gaimes
[07:50] Matt___ has joined the channel
[07:50] chapel: but the response is a stream
[07:50] pkrumins: so what is the bit you dont know?
[07:51] mscdex: i'm determined to learn the spec so i can write a much more complete pdf module
[07:51] sechrist has joined the channel
[07:51] pkrumins: it's a readonly stream, yes.
[07:51] MikhX has joined the channel
[07:51] chapel: well you shouldn't have to write to disk if response is a stream, and your function you want to send it to is a stream as well
[07:51] Fenda: mscdex: SubStack: a second scenario: browser sends post ajax to apache webserver, apache then forwards this data to nodejs + also a mysql db for storage
[07:51] mscdex: it's my new distraction away from distractions
[07:51] mscdex: :p
[07:51] chapel: concerning the guy with the dropbox api wrapper
[07:51] LouiseCiccone: mscdex: pdf module you say?
[07:52] mscdex: LouiseCiccone: yeah
[07:52] pkrumins: so he'd have to either hack that code to export a stream in easy way or find if they do it already
[07:52] pkrumins: the other way around
[07:52] SubStack: Fenda: any reason to keep the node.js side from directly talking to the browser?
[07:52] pkrumins: mscdex: you crayzy!

[07:52] chapel: if he is just downloading the file
[07:52] chapel: then its super simple
[07:52] mscdex: i've dealt with crazy binary protocol/format stuff before, so this isn't much different :)
[07:53] mscdex: it's just a little more complex

[07:53] pkrumins: like 600 pages more of spec ;)
[07:53] micheil: mscdex: pdf's in node == hawt.
[07:53] SubStack: this module is pretty meta
[07:53] mscdex: 756 pages actually
[07:53] mscdex: :p
[07:53] pkrumins: SubStack: i heard you liked meta
[07:53] SubStack: "dnode middleware for processing web middleware stacks for socket.io"
[07:53] pkrumins: " ... over dnode"
[07:53] SubStack: I need it, I swear!
[07:54] pkrumins: make it recursive too
[07:54] SubStack: nah it doesn't actually depend on anything except seq
[07:54] pkrumins: which depends on chainsaw!
[07:54] sechrist has joined the channel
[07:54] SubStack: it does!
[07:54] mscdex: i'm still struggling to come up with a clever name for the module though
[07:55] mscdex: that's the important first step
[07:55] micheil: node-pdf would do.
[07:55] pkrumins: mscdex: node-pdf.
[07:55] SubStack: pkrumins: and chainsaw depends on traverse
[07:55] micheil: or, needyef
[07:55] qFox has joined the channel
[07:55] pkrumins: wat you say!
[07:55] SubStack: I am all about the long dependency chains
[07:55] pkrumins: your stack is deep
[07:55] Fenda: SubStack: in that case; browser requests page from apache server which returns that, then requests information from nodejs which returns that. i see that as 2 client->server calls.
[07:55] svenlito has joined the channel
[07:56] Fenda: SubStack: the apache svr and nodejs are running on 2 boxes right next to eachother so if the apache + nodejs talk to eachother, there is only 1 needed client->server call
[07:56] mscdex: a lot of people complain about the "node-xxxx" module naming convention, that's why i was trying to come up with something else
[07:56] pkrumins: why do they complain!
[07:56] sechrist has joined the channel
[07:56] mscdex: i'm not the one to ask :p
[07:56] Fenda: SubStack: also, i'd rather not setup mysql access from my nodejs to keep it simple
[07:56] pkrumins: ignore them ;)
[07:57] sechrist has joined the channel
[07:57] mscdex: Fenda: why not just do it in PHP or something then? it sounds like you're not really going to be doing much with node
[07:57] mscdex: ACTION dodges the flames
[07:57] mscdex: :>
[07:58] mscdex: i mean you're already going through apache
[07:58] Fenda: mscdex: well my scenario above is only the initial page load. i'm using node with socket.io after this to process instant chat
[07:58] slaskis: mscdex: pdf.js
[07:58] slaskis: ?
[07:58] mscdex: slaskis: taken
[07:58] pkrumins: no 
[07:58] pkrumins: node-pdf
[07:58] SubStack: yeah it seems a bit backwards to use php for the proxying
[07:58] mscdex: Fenda: why for the initial page load?
[07:59] SubStack: Fenda: well then you're already connecting to the node server
[07:59] ivanfi has joined the channel
[07:59] SubStack: from the browser
[07:59] sechrist has joined the channel
[07:59] SubStack: just do that
[07:59] SubStack: browsers can connect to multiple servers
[08:00] SubStack: no need to add a needless layer of slow like php
[08:00] mscdex: or apache
[08:00] mscdex: :-D
[08:00] SubStack: yeah mostly apache
[08:00] Fenda: SubStack: mscdex: perhaps its easier to explain this way, check out facebook chat architecture google doc pg 19: http://tinyurl.com/24wjt6v
[08:00] muhqu has joined the channel
[08:01] Fenda: i'm using this to 'some extent'. channel clusters + presence will be done all in nodejs, chatlogger = mysql, web tier = apache
[08:02] mscdex: that's fine, but like SubStack said, you don't need to proxy the connection
[08:02] SubStack: Fenda: do you have facebook-scale problems?
[08:02] TomY has joined the channel
[08:02] Fenda: SubStack: hell no :D
[08:02] SubStack: if not, you're not solving the same kinds of problems as facebook
[08:02] SubStack: and their solutions won't be terribly applicable
[08:03] mraleph has joined the channel
[08:03] mscdex: yeah, they even resulted to mutating PHP
[08:03] mscdex: heh
[08:04] SubStack: automated AST php transforms
[08:04] SubStack: props for that
[08:04] Fenda: ok for now lets ignore my first scenario. the second scneario (message sends). if i want to stay clear of nodejs->mysql direct access
[08:04] springmeyer has joined the channel
[08:04] mscdex: what's the reasoning behind that restriction?
[08:05] Fenda: browser to apache ajax post the message, apache writes it to mysql, sends it to nodejs for broadcasting to relative sessions
[08:05] Fenda: mscdex: the mysql database runs on the apache machine
[08:05] SubStack: erm
[08:05] SubStack: socket.io is bidirectional
[08:05] mscdex: yikes
[08:05] lumino has joined the channel
[08:05] SubStack: you don't need any of that
[08:05] mscdex: yeah
[08:05] gaYak: Sounds like overengineering and problems.
[08:06] mscdex: fo realz yo
[08:06] Fenda: :P
[08:06] Fenda: SubStack: bidirectional?
[08:06] SubStack: Fenda: it sends and receives
[08:06] Fenda: SubStack: yes. but if i send to nodejs, then nodejs must take responsibility for DB writes yeah?
[08:07] mscdex: Fenda: only if you want persistence of what's going on
[08:07] shiawuen has joined the channel
[08:07] mscdex: like permanently
[08:07] SubStack: there are other ways to strap a database onto what you're building too
[08:08] SubStack: node does have database libs itself
[08:08] Fenda: SubStack: ill look into them thanks
[08:08] SubStack: but if you don't like those you can whip up a quick perl script or something that keeps open a connection to your node process and proxies the db stuff
[08:08] seemann has joined the channel
[08:08] SubStack: but that would be worse I think
[08:09] mscdex: yeah there's a plethora of database modules, mostly nosql though
[08:09] mjr_: Sometimes, there are multiple modules for a given nosql database.
[08:09] mjr_: That is how much we hate sql
[08:10] mscdex: but fwiw node-mysql exists and is async and generally works well
[08:10] mscdex: and is in active development
[08:10] Fenda: thanks
[08:10] sechrist has joined the channel
[08:10] mscdex: and the author, felixge, frequents here
[08:10] Fenda: mscdex: i guess a persistency in the current node instant would be ok
[08:11] mscdex: i mean for short term stuff, you could easily keep an in-memory buffer or whatever
[08:11] mscdex: depending on your needs
[08:11] Fenda: yea

[08:53] bingomanatee: most of that is going to be regex - centric and regular expressions can be found across the internet in various forms. 
[08:53] slickplaid: I'm using https://github.com/chriso/node-validator but the code i'm writing seems really... drawn out and not very optimized

[08:54] SubStack: I just make sure there's an @

[12:24] SubStack: Does it work? If so, you're doing it right.

[13:16] torvalamo: foo-bar-, what
[13:16] torvalamo: which version
[13:16] foo-bar-: the error is "Task Failed  (err #2): {task: libv8.a SConstruct -> libv8.a}"
[13:16] foo-bar-: v0.3.6
[13:16] foo-bar-: I've tried export SHELL=/bin/bash
[13:16] torvalamo: 0.3.x doesn't build on cygwin
[13:16] foo-bar-: ahh
[13:16] foo-bar-: ok
[13:17] foo-bar-: does it build on windows at all?

[13:18] torvalamo: make a list
[13:18] SubStack: on it!
[13:19] torvalamo: and then realize there's no way you can do all that, because as you're doing them you add 5 new things for every other line of code

[13:55] micheil: it's up on npm (or should be)
[13:56] micheil: we also have facebook-realtime-graph, for interacting with facebook's realtime Graph API
[13:56] Nomon: I just used the httpClient 
[13:57] Nomon: and if you need authentication throw in one of the oauth consumers for node :)

[13:57] EGreg_: micheil! Great!
[13:57] EGreg_: let's see
[13:58] micheil: EGreg_: let me know if you need any help with it
[13:58] EGreg_: I have a question then
[13:58] micheil: okay
[13:58] EGreg_: I have an access token, can I issue POST requests to facebook's graph api?
[13:58] EGreg_: how do I post on a person's wall for example
[13:58] chrischris has joined the channel
[13:59] micheil: yes
[13:59] micheil: oh, wait, read that wrong
[13:59] micheil: you need to use the connection on the facebook graph.
[13:59] micheil: one moment
[14:00] micheil: see the publishing section here: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/post/

[14:03] EGreg_: but I am not sure, what is "id" in Client.prototype.postObject ?
[14:03] micheil: https://gist.github.com/91a4aa4f5854b798da48
[14:04] micheil: yeah, I saw each, but none implemented it in a way that I liked
[14:04] micheil: id is the user id
[14:04] jlecker has joined the channel
[14:04] sechrist has joined the channel
[14:04] EGreg_: so how do I post on a user's wall
[14:04] micheil: it can either be a facebook user id, or, it can be "me"
[14:04] EGreg_: ah
[14:04] EGreg_: https://gist.github.com/91a4aa4f5854b798da48
[14:05] EGreg_: easy! thanks
[14:05] EGreg_: I don't suppose we can upload pictures with graph api yet, right
[14:05] EGreg_: (you may not know this)
[14:05] micheil: actually...
[14:05] micheil: whoops.
[14:05] Lorentz: Wooo facebook api in node
[14:05] torvalamo has joined the channel
[14:05] sivy has joined the channel
[14:05] EGreg_: it should say .postConnection btw, not post_connection
[14:05] micheil: hmm, did the api change?
[14:06] EGreg_: can you explain what is this getObject vs getConnection ? What is the "conection of an object on the graph"
[14:06] EGreg_: why don't you just let me specify the path of the url
[14:06] micheil: okay, getConnection retrieves a specific connection on the graph
[14:06] micheil: where as getObject retrieves a specific object from the graph
[14:06] EGreg_: what if later, facebook will have a/b/c ?
[14:06] micheil: a connection belongs to an object
[14:06] EGreg_: 2/commonFriends/3
[14:06] EGreg_: for example
[14:07] micheil: if facebook's api changes later, I'll change the client.
[14:07] micheil: simple.
[14:07] sechrist has joined the channel
[14:07] EGreg_: I think I will just use .request :)
[14:07] micheil: damn. I've gotta re-publish to npm.
[14:07] EGreg_: oh, you expose .request :) which is nice
[14:07] micheil: watch out there..
[14:07] EGreg_: okay, I'm sold
[14:07] Kingdutch: JS exposes everything
[14:08] micheil: I'd highly recommend using the actual methods, not just doing it with .request
[14:08] sechrist has joined the channel
[14:08] EGreg_: client.request('post', 'me/post', args, callback)
[14:08] EGreg_: right?
[14:08] EGreg_: why is that?
[14:09] micheil: EGreg_: this is an early version of the module, so things might change as I start to use it more
[14:09] EGreg_: what is the license btw
[14:09] EGreg_: of the file
[14:09] micheil: well, simply because .request is just in there
[14:09] backthatzachup_ has joined the channel
[14:09] micheil: the license is in /LICENSE.md
[14:09] micheil: it's a MIT style license.
[14:09] EGreg_: does it allow commercial use?
[14:09] micheil: yes
[14:10] EGreg_: deal in the Software without restriction, ok
[14:10] EGreg_: Sounds good
[14:10] micheil: (although, really, if you sell just our work, we'd be kinda pissed, to tell you the truth)
[14:10] EGreg_: so how do I insall it? npm what
[14:10] micheil: but it can be solid within other projects
[14:10] EGreg_: nah I wouldn't sell your work lol, but I'd incorporate it in a program I am making
[14:10] EGreg_: which I might charge my client for
[14:10] micheil: that's fine then
[14:10] EGreg_: cool :)
[14:10] EGreg_: this is awesome, I can now implement my "broadcasting" app
[14:11] EGreg_: someone asked me to make an app for them where people will sign up on their website, that they can post on their wall
[14:11] micheil: you can either add it into a package.json as a dependency or you can do `npm install facebook-graph-client`
[14:11] EGreg_: and when they post, it gets syndicated on everyone's wall who opted in
[14:11] EGreg_: I want to use Node.js for the background process that actually posts
[14:11] Kingdutch: That's sooo annoying
[14:11] Kingdutch: If I find a service that does that I opt-out within 10 min.
[14:11] micheil: you'll probably need to use node-oauth and connect-auth for that as well
[14:11] backthatzachup_ has left the channel
[14:11] EGreg_: well some people want it I guess
[14:12] Kingdutch: No offense to you :) Just my .2$ 
[14:12] Kingdutch: .02$*
[14:12] EGreg_: maybe a club would post something on all promoters' walls
[14:12] EGreg_: or an organization
[14:12] micheil: EGreg_: if you get paid to make it, why not.?
[14:12] mnbvasd: ACTION sickers
[14:12] Kingdutch: Yeh agreed with Micheil
[14:12] EGreg_: micheil: why is that
[14:12] Kingdutch: If you can get paid for something, just do it
[14:12] EGreg_: micheil: I have a PHP facebook client, it already has the access token, I just have to pass it to Node
[14:12] mnbvasd: 2¢?
[14:12] sechrist has joined the channel
[14:12] Kingdutch: Don't have that char

[14:13] EGreg_: that's my project
[14:13] micheil: EGreg_: oh, I thought you were going to implement it all in node
[14:13] EGreg_: long-term I mean
[14:13] sechrist has joined the channel
[14:13] micheil: if you already have the tokens, that's fine then.
[14:13] EGreg_: micheil: oh, no I use PHP for request serving, and Node.js for backend and socket.io
[14:13] EGreg_: I mean for services and socket.io
[14:13] micheil: as for being able to publish anytime, you'll need to request offline_access
[14:13] EGreg_: I communicate with Node usig simple POSTs
[14:13] EGreg_: on a firewalled port
[14:14] EGreg_: yep I am already doing that on the browser side
[14:14] micheil: good good
[14:14] sechrist has joined the channel
[14:14] mnbvasd: Kingdutch: you don't have <alt gr>c ?
[14:14] EGreg_: wait, offline_access? or stream_post ?
[14:14] EGreg_: I thought stream_post encompasses offline_access
[14:14] mnbvasd: must be a damn foreign dutch keyboard? ;)
[14:14] micheil: offline_access
[14:14] EGreg_: let me check quickly
[14:15] Kingdutch: �
[14:15] Kingdutch: Copyright icon! :D
[14:15] EGreg_: woo hoo!
[14:15] mnbvasd: ok that's more relevant... how about with a c?
[14:15] mnbvasd: ermn shift
[14:15] Kingdutch: �
[14:15] Kingdutch: Oh there u are
[14:15] EGreg_: publish_stream	Enables your application to post content, comments, and likes to a user's stream and to the streams of the user's friends. With this permission, you can publish content to a user's feed at any time, without requiring offline_access. However, please note that Facebook recommends a user-initiated sharing model.
[14:15] micheil: EGreg_: let me just republish to npm..
[14:15] EGreg_: Aha, memory serves me well! :)
[14:15] Kingdutch: And it's the Logitech G11 Bought in the NL correct, but mapped to American English
[14:15] micheil: oh, well, there you go.
[14:16] micheil: I'm just used to having to need offline_access
[14:16] EGreg_: I doubt ha offline_access lets you publish the stream though
[14:16] EGreg_: also I wish fcacebook supported push for comments or something
[14:16] EGreg_: so when someone posts a comment to an xid, I get a ping about it
[14:16] EGreg_: I hate pulling comments
[14:16] micheil: EGreg_: multiple permissions
[14:16] EGreg_: because I have 10000000 xids
[14:17] EGreg_: but anyway, cool!
[14:17] micheil: EGreg_: check out the realtime graph for that. that's all I'll say there :)
[14:17] EGreg_: what is the npm id
[14:17] EGreg_: of your thing
[14:17] EGreg_: wait, really? realtimegraph?
[14:17] micheil: npm install facebook-graph-client
[14:17] EGreg_: can you link me?
[14:17] EGreg_: sweet! I like your client! Nice and simple.
[14:17] EGreg_: and what do I require?

[14:19] micheil: yeah, http://developers.facebook.com/docs/api/realtime

[14:29] davidsklar has joined the channel
[14:29] micheil: as to having that in node core? it'd be vetoed
[14:30] micheil: Kingdutch: try looking at other class systems too. eg, Class.js
[14:30] Kingdutch: I'm doubting, cause I read somewhere it was a performance hit, but it would increase development time
[14:30] sechrist has joined the channel
[14:30] Kingdutch: Nah it'd be for client side mostly
[14:30] micheil: well, Class.js works for client side too.
[14:30] Kingdutch: Ruby style =/ never did ruby
[14:30] micheil: and doesn't extend the prototype object.
[14:30] micheil: well, prototype.js was originally from ruby too.

[15:12] piscisaureus: tiemonster: but I'm not so sure that they will do something about it
[15:12] tiemonster: so Node runs without error, but all unit tests still fail as far as I can tell.
[15:12] piscisaureus: well, not all should fail
[15:12] piscisaureus: for me ~40 fail and the rest passes
[15:12] skampler has joined the channel
[15:13] piscisaureus: if all fail, then there must be something wrong with the test runner
[15:13] tiemonster: Path: message/hello_world
[15:13] tiemonster: The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.
[15:13] tiemonster: Command: c:\node\build\default\node.exe c:\node\test\message\hello_world.js

[15:14] piscisaureus: running from mingw console?
[15:14] torvalamo: you may need double backslash
[15:14] torvalamo: depending on the console

[15:15] bradleymeck: does anyone know of a lazy sort in js (sorts as w/e it returns iterates rather than doing a full on sort for some performance on long lived and big objects)?
[15:16] piscisaureus: tiemonster: so *all* tests failed?
[15:16] tiemonster: piscisaureus: anyways, now that we have a somewhat stable build, we'll see what we can do about the setenv/unsetenv stuff for Win32
[15:16] piscisaureus: ok. if you get it done, I will give you a more challenging job :-)
[15:16] piscisaureus: heh
[15:17] sechrist has joined the channel
[15:17] torvalamo: took you two days to get it to compile in mingw?
[15:17] tiemonster: piscisaureus: [00:07|% 100|+   0|- 167]: Done
[15:17] piscisaureus: tiemonster: clearly a test runner issue. It doesn't even start node or it wouldn't be done in 7 seconds
[15:18] russ_nyc: tjholowaychuk: any ideas on issue 68? https://github.com/visionmedia/expresso/issues#issue/68
[15:18] sechrist has joined the channel
[15:18] piscisaureus: tiemonster: u need SetEnvironmentVariableW (so the unicode version)
[15:18] tiemonster: what does that mean?
[15:18] tiemonster: oh - Win32 API calls?
[15:18] piscisaureus: yup
[15:18] tjholowaychuk: russ_nyc: hmm not sure off hand
[15:18] tiemonster: gotcha
[15:18] tjholowaychuk: russ_nyc: it does try to run them as soon as any are available
[15:18] tiemonster: ACTION runs to get something to take notes
[15:19] piscisaureus: tiemonster: there are logs too, heh.
[15:19] tjholowaychuk: russ_nyc: that feature is kinda half-assed
[15:19] tjholowaychuk: hell expresso in general is kinda half-assed haha I should be rewritting it sometime in the next few months

[15:21] russ_nyc: tjholowaychuk: are there any other node testing frameworks that will work until you get expresso rewritten?

[15:23] tiemonster: piscisaureus: are there any unit tests written for process.setenv and process.unsetenv?
[15:23] russ_nyc: im not knowcking it
[15:23] russ_nyc: i love how its set up, its just the async part
[15:23] tjholowaychuk: micheil: its just not feature complete, it was a big hack haha
[15:23] Sembiance: russ_nyc: in which way did you split upi your data between mongo/redis? What data are you storing in redis vs mongo? Just curious :)
[15:23] micheil: oh. what's missing?
[15:23] tjholowaychuk: the exports bite you as well for the issue russ is having
[15:23] tjholowaychuk: but ive never personally had that issue
[15:24] piscisaureus: tiemonster: test-process-env mayble
[15:24] skampler_ has joined the channel
[15:24] tjholowaychuk: vows is lame, expresso is lame
[15:24] tjholowaychuk: much better ideas in mind haha
[15:24] tjholowaychuk: just need time
[15:24] russ_nyc: Sembiance: i use redis for queueing and for quick access, it is much faster than mongo for puts
[15:24] micheil: ohh.. async exports in tests
[15:24] bradleymeck: tj just needs clones
[15:24] russ_nyc: tjholowaychuk: id love to contribute
[15:25] piscisaureus: tiemonster: though that test may fail due to child process issues too atm
[15:25] tjholowaychuk: i like the simplicity of using the exports but it does kinda suck for that
[15:25] tjholowaychuk: most libraries queue commands internally though so it ends up not being a problem
[15:25] djanowski: tjholowaychuk: i'd like to know why you don't like vows
[15:26] tiemonster: piscisaureus: thanks for your help setting things up. I hope we're able to make a decent contribution.
[15:26] tjholowaychuk: djanowski: because i dont like one key, and one callback per assertion
[15:26] tjholowaychuk: it does nothing that i actually want lol
[15:26] djanowski: tjholowaychuk: agreed, that kinda sucks

[15:43] sechrist has joined the channel
[15:43] Anti-X: you need to return from that also

[15:53] bradleymeck: define blank and what filetype you want
[15:54] devdazed: png and invisible
[15:54] tiemonster: devdazed: make it, then store the binary equivalent wherever you want
[15:54] devdazed: gif will work also
[15:55] devdazed: tiemonster: how would I store the binary equivalent in a .js file?
[15:55] tiemonster: as a string?
[15:55] Anti-X: the most reasonable way would be to make a 1x1px file and then access it on startup and put it in memory
[15:55] bradleymeck: buffer is better due to possible f ups in utf
[15:55] Anti-X: and serve it from there
[15:56] devdazed: ok
[15:56] bradleymeck: agree anti-x
[15:56] Anti-X: you could store it as base64
[15:56] Anti-X: actually that can be made from within a browser
[15:56] Anti-X: make a 1x1 canvas
[15:56] Anti-X: and toData it
[15:56] Anti-X: or something
[15:57] sechrist has joined the channel
[15:57] Anti-X: afaik that's png format
[15:58] devdazed: hmm, thanks for your help all. I think that reading it from disk on startup might be the way to go. this way it might avoid any potential problems
[16:01] tiemonster: devdazed: pixel = 'R0lGODdhAQABAIAAAP///////ywAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=';
[16:01] pjackson has joined the channel
[16:02] devdazed: tiemonster: how would i send that across in the http send mthod?
[16:02] tiemonster: just base64 decode it before you chuck it at the browser, and make sure you set the right mimetype
[16:02] devdazed: nice

[16:05] piscisaureus: Anti-X: does not work with IE
[16:05] tiemonster: Anti-X: the whole point is that he's catching impressions on the Node side
[16:05] Anti-X: it's hypothetical
[16:05] Anti-X: i thought we solved his problem ages ago
[16:05] Anti-X: on irc, we first solve problems, then we optimize
[16:06] Anti-X: piscisaureus, not ie9 either?

[16:07] strmpnk has joined the channel
[16:07] piscisaureus: IE 9 does not exist
[16:07] Anti-X: the plus side of this approach though is that it reduces the amount of requests to the server
[16:07] Anti-X: by 1 per page view, sans caching
[16:08] devdazed: Anti-X: 'R0lGODdhAQABAIAAAP///////ywAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=' does decode as a 1x1px gif

[17:21] podman: everything else is not
[17:21] podman: weird
[17:22] micheil: podman: /usr/local can easily be owned by your user
[17:22] micheil: which is what npm suggests, iirc.

[17:52] tanepiper: starting to look like proper docs :)
[17:52] gkatsev: tjholowaychuk: btw, I saw your tweet about android and java. Well, you can use jython or scala or a lot of other jvm languages. Possibly even rhino :)
[17:52] tjholowaychuk: gkatsev: i forgot about phonegap :) haha
[17:52] tjholowaychuk: havent tried it out yet
[17:52] gkatsev: that also exists
[17:52] gkatsev: there are a few such things
[17:52] sechrist has joined the channel
[17:53] gkatsev: but yeah, no need to dirty yourself with java to make android games :)
[17:53] tanepiper: tjholowaychuk: what you doing with android?
[17:53] tjholowaychuk: tanepiper: probably a github app
[17:54] micheil: ryah: some how though, I don't think I'll force documentation writers to have to write markdown tables.. *shudders*
[17:54] micheil: I think I'll use jsdoc style argument definitions

[17:55] tjholowaychuk: oh cool :)

[17:57] tanepiper: mscdex: what are you using to gen the docs?  I need to doc my code and get some docs out
[17:57] tanepiper: eh, micheil 
[17:57] micheil: then I can have the doctool convert them to html tables.
[17:57] mscdex: heh :)
[17:57] ryah: micheil: that's fine. how about Param: instead of @param
[17:57] micheil: (we already use the @ symbol else where in the doctool, for the includes
[17:57] ryah: ah, ok
[17:57] micheil: both of which can be changed
[17:58] gnrfan has joined the channel
[17:58] micheil: although, your less likely to write /^@param/ then /^Param:/
[17:58] micheil: I think.
[17:58] liar has joined the channel
[17:58] micheil: but both work.
[17:58] ryah: we could also just change back to asciidoc :)
[17:58] mscdex: @return !
[17:58] mscdex: :p
[17:58] micheil: I think I'll switch to /^Param:/
[17:58] micheil: mscdex: returns should be described in the body of the function.
[17:59] micheil: body of the documentation.
[17:59] micheil: erm, description of the method.
[17:59] mscdex: well, the parameters could also
[17:59] mscdex: but they're separate

[18:13] dstufft: if NVM_DIR exists

[18:26] mscdex: real developers don't need tab completion!

[18:35] micheil: crypto module is some nasty stuff.. way too big imho.
[18:36] ryah: yes
[18:36] ryah: also we need to start giving some love to modules
[18:36] aklt: ryah: The crypto stuff seems somewhat broken, would be grat to have it debugged or somehow made sane!
[18:36] micheil: ryah: you'll possibly love what I've just discussed with isaac
[18:36] tjholowaychuk: it wont be less broken as a module
[18:36] tjholowaychuk: and if anyone wants a decent implementation we will force people to compile more stuff
[18:37] tjholowaychuk: which is kinda lame
[18:37] sechrist has joined the channel
[18:37] ryah: aklt: debugging your issue is what made me decide to take it out
[18:37] micheil: ryah: how about you do: tls from crypto into a new node core module
[18:37] micheil: and then remove crypto?
[18:37] micheil: if that makes sense.
[18:37] micheil: so, process.binding('tls')
[18:38] aklt: ryah: Cool!  I also gave it a couple of hours, but I ended up producing other problems,...  I am no openssl expert to say the least...
[18:38] ryah: im removing it because the code is horrible
[18:38] ryah: and it's not related to networking
[18:38] ryah: and i dont need it
[18:38] micheil: +1 to removing it.
[18:38] micheil: but also +1 to having someone maintain it.
[18:39] aklt: +1 for that!
[18:39] romanb has joined the channel
[18:39] tjholowaychuk: +1 bASLDFASDf
[18:39] Kingdutch: +2 for some kind of working ssl though
[18:40] micheil: Kingdutch: you obviously haven't really been following node@head
[18:40] aklt: Probably something decent could be made if one keeps half an eye on an existing openssl binding, python, Lua, or whatever
[18:40] Kingdutch: micheil: I havent
[18:40] micheil: well, it has some very good / awesome leaps closer towards working ssl
[18:40] Kingdutch: Oh ok
[18:40] Kingdutch: :D
[18:41] isaacs: ryah: aww, it's super handy having hashing in node.
[18:41] devdazed: tjholowaychuk: to get around the issue of the async tests not running properly, i have the following solution
[18:41] isaacs: ryah: but i get it, you're on the warpath ;)
[18:41] devdazed: tjholowaychuk: have 1 test per file 
[18:41] svenlito has joined the channel
[18:41] devdazed: tjholowaychuk: then i wrote this wrapper: https://gist.github.com/797182
[18:42] aklt: I would also *love* to have hashing as I need it to decrypt cookies in an application I am writing
[18:42] tjholowaychuk: devdazed: i dont know what libraries you are using, i've never needed it
[18:42] tjholowaychuk: for mongodb, redis, etc
[18:42] mscdex: well, base64 is related to HTTP
[18:42] devdazed: so just run node expresso_suite_runner.js and it will run all tests asynchronously and report back when it is done
[18:42] mscdex: for auth
[18:42] mscdex: :p
[18:42] tjholowaychuk: most of them queue commands until connected
[18:42] aklt: ...But maybe this is a good path towards a better implementation?
[18:43] matti has joined the channel
[18:43] devdazed: right but when i have 2 tests, one inside a mongodb connection and one in a redis connectio, the first gets run but the second doesnt
[18:43] matti: Hey guys.
[18:43] tjholowaychuk: devdazed: yeah but im saying I dont use async exports at all
[18:43] devdazed: theres also an issue where it give the wrong test name if the one passes and the other doesnt
[18:44] devdazed: oh, i know i was putting it out here in case anyone could use it
[18:44] matti: I have a problem with when I use sys.pump in 0.2.6 -- node seem to not close the read stream ... I was trying few things I was able to find in Google.
[18:44] matti: But it still keeps it open.
[18:44] aklt: ryah: What came out of your debugging? Did you conclude that it is not worth keeping the code for a possible module?

[18:56] dgathright has joined the channel
[18:56] Aikar: well a lib exposes a function, binding it to node simply requires C/C++ knowledge on importing a shared lib, writing a wrapper function thats exported to node, and pass args correctly.
[18:57] aklt: Yea.  I would attempt it, or at least a module that covers my needs, but it would be great to have some advice on openssl.
[18:58] aklt: I say that because I think correct use of openssl was the most difficult part

[19:06] devdazed: let me rephrase: if it is possible, how do you chekc if a port is available from node?
[19:07] mnbvasd: devdazed: netstat lna | grep :<portno> , or just try to bind to it and see if it fails.
[19:07] tiemonster: I can think of lots of reasons why you shouldn't even try to check from Node
[19:07] langworthy has joined the channel
[19:07] tiemonster: and a couple why you might want to
[19:07] mnbvasd: erm add a - to that.
[19:08] devdazed: well, during the tests im running multiple instances of expresso to run my tests faster. but expresso bind to port 5555 for the http server part
[19:08] devdazed: so i want to modify expresso to check the port first then bind if it is available otherwise use a different port
[19:09] MrWarGames1 has joined the channel
[19:09] springmeyer has joined the channel

[20:43] tjholowaychuk: require() was (is still?) slow
[20:43] tjholowaychuk: doing the stats or whatever
[20:43] tjholowaychuk: not sure if that was fixed for cached modules
[20:43] herbySk: JimBastard: javascript's is value, index, container
[20:43] tjholowaychuk: IMO do your best not to lazy require

[20:57] brianc: eazyigz: no worries what so ever

[20:57] eazyigz: i gotta read up on how v8 does GC
[20:58] bradleymeck: well the global is never gc'ed so you cant gc its properties ;)
[20:58] eazyigz: can't i manually gc?  I mean like in C/C++?

[21:07] eazyigz: bradleymeck: you mean index.js in node-memcached folder?  Or in its parent folder?

[21:08] eazyigz: what the heck?  Why can't an index.js be in there automatically, I mean if these packages have that requirement....
[21:08] fission6: okay one last time, any reason why npm is installing my package as some_module -> ./some_module@9999.0.0-LINK-a4755c50

[21:09] isaacs: fission6: and the 9999.0.0-LINK-a4755c50 version (linked version) is active
[21:09] isaacs: fission6: link packages get a fakey version.
[21:09] tim_smart: isaacs: Fun little tool that uses npm https://github.com/Tim-Smart/npm-deploy
[21:09] V1: eazyigz: as for a stable memcached client, I suggest https://github.com/3rd-Eden/node-memcached :)
[21:09] isaacs: fission6: otherwise it breaks in Bad Ways when you touch the package.json file
[21:10] fission6: damn how do i change that because i have a dependancy on that package
[21:10] isaacs: though i think i could maybe yank out that stuff and it might work now
[21:10] eazyigz: bradeymeck: I looked at redis-node-client package and it also doesn't have index.js.  Are people unaware of this requirement?  I know I wasn't.
[21:10] isaacs: fission6: change what?
[21:10] eazyigz: bradleymeck:... sorry
[21:10] isaacs: fission6: how do you make npm not do that with link packages, or how do you not use a link package?
[21:10] Aikar: eazyigz: what package?
[21:10] sechrist has joined the channel
[21:10] bradleymeck: eazyigz, most use the main field in package.json and just use npm
[21:10] Aikar: if you tell it require('dir/') it has to load some file
[21:10] fission6: how do i specify "some_package" as a dependancy for another package if its version is "fakey"
[21:10] V1: Packages don't need an index.js if they link to the correct package name 
[21:11] eazyigz: Aikar: https://github.com/fictorial/redis-node-client
[21:11] Aikar: eazyigz: yeah that author didnt make it 'non npm' friendly
[21:11] isaacs: fission6: {"dependencies":{"some_package":"*"}} would match it
[21:11] tim_smart: eazyigz: You don't need a index.js
[21:11] V1: eazyigz: Read the description, it's deprecated
[21:11] Aikar: actually he did, he just expects you to reference to the lib folder
[21:11] isaacs: fission6: you could also do "1.2.3 || 9999"
[21:11] tim_smart: It just makes it easier for deployment
[21:11] eazyigz: ahhh...
[21:11] fission6: i think i have it now, nice thanks!
[21:12] isaacs: eazyigz: why not use `npm install redis`?
[21:12] eazyigz: V1: node-memcached from 3rd-Eden doesn't have index.js either
[21:12] isaacs: eazyigz: https://github.com/mranney/node_redis#readme
[21:12] V1: eazyigz: it has main: "main": "./nMemcached",
[21:12] sechrist has joined the channel
[21:13] eazyigz: V1: so you're right, index.js is not an absolute requirement

[21:13] Aikar: eazyigz: i said it is for you to do require('directory/');
[21:13] isaacs: also, index.js is kinda weird in the debugger and stack traces.  you end up with a lot of index.js files.
[21:13] isaacs: it'd be cooler if it loaded foo/foo.js when you do require("foo")
[21:13] Aikar: if you require straight to that github repo, it doesnt have an index so node doesnt know what to load
[21:14] Aikar: isaacs: ill add support for that if ryans cool with it
[21:14] isaacs: Aikar: sure, should be pretty trivial, though it will increase the number of stats, which is unfortuante.
[21:14] isaacs: but then we could deprecate index.js
[21:14] isaacs: (maybe, eventually, some day)
[21:14] Aikar: isaacs: well i plan to fix the stat thing tonight/now
[21:14] bradleymeck: lol require("git@github.com:...") would be terrible

[21:15] tim_smart: bradleymeck: I'm playing with a deploy tool the reads a deploy.js file in your project https://github.com/Tim-Smart/npm-deploy/blob/master/test/mixture/deploy.js
[21:15] Aikar: what change he make? ive been messing in modules and i didnt see any cache stuff
[21:16] tim_smart: bradleymeck: It then also reads the package.json and installs listed dependencies there.
[21:16] sechrist has joined the channel
[21:16] bradleymeck: ah github deploy hooks, i vaguely remember making one
[21:16] isaacs: Aikar: check out the code in lib/module.js, starting around like 84
[21:16] isaacs: *line 84
[21:16] Aikar: oh nvm
[21:16] sechrist has joined the channel
[21:16] Aikar: it is there
[21:17] isaacs: Aikar: it's cached based on the request and the state of require.paths
[21:17] Aikar: although it needs a reference to parent
[21:17] isaacs: the "request" thing is already glommed onto the parent's path
[21:17] isaacs: if it's relativ
[21:17] isaacs: e
[21:18] mgutz has joined the channel
[21:18] Aikar: i was going to implement it right at the top of Module._load with almost same thing but cacheKey = json.stringify({filename,parent.id,paths}) or so
[21:19] isaacs: Aikar: unnecessary
[21:19] sechrist has joined the channel
[21:19] isaacs: check out the _resolveLookupPaths function
[21:19] isaacs: your suggestion ^^ will result in require("foo") being different based on different parents
[21:19] isaacs: but if bar.js does require("foo"), and baz.js does require("foo"), and require.paths hasn't changed, then it shoudl hit the cache
[21:20] Aikar: hmm true
[21:20] sechrist has joined the channel
[21:20] Aikar: i guess its good then :)
[21:21] isaacs: Aikar: yeah, what's there is good

[21:34] Qbix1: (EGreg and I are the same person)
[21:34] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: does that do that, too?  don't you have to wrap something to save the stack when you jump into the event loop?
[21:34] Qbix1: who do I post as? Can I post as this user on their own wall, by storing their access_token and using it later?
[21:35] Qbix1: Since every user has a limit of 15 posts on walls a day
[21:35] micheil: you would need those 1000 users' access_tokens and you would need to fire them in a loop.
[21:35] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: it's not just about setting the limit longer, it's about having the -------- and then the calling scope
[21:35] Qbix1: I am just worried that their access_tokens expire when they log out
[21:35] micheil: access_tokens expire.

[22:33] bingomanatee: I just got a client on the hook for a noSql transform of real estate listings; the nature of his dataset - the need for instrospection into the history of a record - suggest to me CouchDB over MongoDB, my current standard noSql solution. 
[22:33] bingomanatee: Two things I want to know about couchDB - 
[22:33] maushu: It's evil.
[22:33] bingomanatee: 1) how is sharding/partitioning handled
[22:33] maushu: Worship mongodb till the end of days.
[22:34] chapel: lol
[22:34] chapel: bingomanatee: couchdb doesn't do sharding
[22:34] chapel: master <-> master
[22:34] sechrist has joined the channel
[22:34] maushu: When I look at this http://couchdb.apache.org/img/sketch.png it makes me twitch.
[22:35] bingomanatee: m. thtas a problem. I'm looking into couchdb-lounge a superset product to see if it meets my needs. 
[22:35] chapel: there is bigcouch which gives a more distributed approach
[22:35] bingomanatee: yeah that is a problem. 
[22:35] tilgovi: problem?
[22:35] chapel: why does it make you twitch?
[22:35] bradleymeck has joined the channel
[22:35] bingomanatee: I'm really not eager to become an erlang programmer - I am hopign that stuff stays under the hood where it belongs. 
[22:35] chapel: uhh
[22:35] chapel: you can use erland
[22:35] tilgovi: bingomanatee: I can tell you that while I'm committed to improving lounge for another iteration or so, my long term strategy is to move to bigcouch.
[22:35] chapel: erlang, but everything can be done with js
[22:36] tilgovi: And I'm the only developer actively contributing to couchdb-lounge.
[22:36] bingomanatee: I'm probably going to dual test couch against mongo for this particular client to see which product meets their needs the best
[22:36] chapel: mapreduce/views/designs
[22:36] bingomanatee: Since I already rock with Mongo 
[22:36] skot has joined the channel
[22:36] bingomanatee: what are the discriminatory features between bigcouch and lounge?
[22:36] ShizWeaK_ has joined the channel
[22:36] sechrist has joined the channel
[22:36] chapel: well bingomanatee couchdb is great for dealing with a lot of data
[22:36] bingomanatee: The client is in the realty space and wants to metacrawl the real estate listings. 
[22:37] chapel: honestly I would choose couchdb for something like realty
[22:37] bingomanatee: So we can be guaranteed that the datbase will never be bigger than the number of houses in the planet
[22:37] tilgovi: bingomanatee: lounge has asynchronous replication whereas bigcouch lets you specify the consistency level. bigcouch is probably more efficient since it operates at the erlang layer and avoids more JSON round trip encodings
[22:37] bingomanatee: times the number of times said houses are sold. 
[22:37] chapel: because it would be super simple to make nice mapreduce views to handle all types of data, and it incrementally updates
[22:37] tilgovi: from a client perspective they're both just couches
[22:38] Me1000 has joined the channel
[22:38] chapel: I dont know enough about mongo to really speak, but I was under the impression it doesn't actually store mapreduce results and runs them each time?
[22:38] bingomanatee: So the sharding is subsumed by bigcouch/lounge?
[22:38] bingomanatee: hey youre the same guy... :D
[22:39] tilgovi: if by subsumed you mean hidden from the application, yeah.
[22:39] bingomanatee: thats ideal. 
[22:39] kriszyp has joined the channel
[22:39] bingomanatee: so maushu - what is your issue with couch?
[22:39] tilgovi: yeah. bigcouch and lounge are actually very similar from the outside and I talk constantly with the cloudant people so I can move to make that even *more* true.
[22:39] bingomanatee: I'd like to hear both sides of the story. 
[22:39] techwraith: Does anyone have any ideas for how to implement an accurate file upload progress bar with js on the front end and node on the back?
[22:40] maushu: bingomanatee, erlang.
[22:40] tilgovi: like I said... I'm trying to move lounge toward bigcouch until they converge enough that I can flip my production cluster over as much as possible "in place"
[22:40] maushu: Everyone knows erlang was created using the blood of sacrificed virgins to the dark gods at moonlight.
[22:40] bingomanatee: maushu - yes - but is it exposed? or are you concernd about performance?
[22:41] bingomanatee: yeah - can't really take that to my client. 
[22:41] bingomanatee: Give me the power point version if you can. 
[22:41] tilgovi: maushu: but that keeps the children away. it's like having a spooky sign outside your mansion production studio so you don't get interrupted while churning out chart-topping beats.
[22:41] maushu: ...
[22:41] maushu: CONSPIRANCY!
[22:42] maushu: bingomanatee, just see that image. Apache usually focus on proper development instead of performance.
[22:42] bingomanatee: I'm seeing massive job security. If I can hook my clients on an erlang based product I can jerk up my rates big time and they'll have to pay :D
[22:42] maushu: Then do it.
[22:42] hornairs has joined the channel
[22:42] bingomanatee: I dunno. I do plan to run the couch system head to head with MongoDB to see what the experiential difference is. 
[22:42] chapel: but you see, you dont touch erland
[22:42] chapel: erlang
[22:43] chapel: its json/js as far as interfacing with it
[22:43] maushu: The reason I don't use it, it's because of erlang, the need to run a erlang vm just to run couch.
[22:43] bingomanatee: thats what I'm thinking. I mean, what is MongoDB written in, C? who cares really?
[22:43] tilgovi: bingomanatee: ooh, yay. everyone loves comparing apples to oranges ;)
[22:43] maushu: And sharding, I need sharding.
[22:43] bingomanatee: They are both round fruit and about the same size and weight. 
[22:43] bingomanatee: ha.
[22:43] tilgovi: about the same until you bite into them.
[22:43] tilgovi: it's a pretty good analogy really
[22:43] bingomanatee: Yeah. 
[22:43] chapel: mongodb is like mysql of nosql
[22:43] bingomanatee: They both keep you alive. 
[22:43] bingomanatee: Oranges cure scurvy. 
[22:44] chapel: couchdb is something different
[22:44] bingomanatee: Apples are good for your theeth. 
[22:44] maushu: sql server?
[22:44] bradleymeck: sharding is the secret sause
[22:44] bingomanatee: Reall - since when was comparing an orange to an apple a formidable deliverable. 
[22:44] maushu: bingomanatee, and then there is the banana: redis.
[22:44] bingomanatee: Now - comprare an orange to a buick - thats a challenge. 
[22:44] maushu: Very tasty but can stab you in the eye.
[22:45] bingomanatee: so can your own thumb. 
[22:45] bingomanatee: gonna cut that off for safety?
[22:45] tilgovi: maushu: how can you get stabbed in the eye with a buick?
[22:45] bingomanatee: You got two eyes 
[22:45] bingomanatee: hes talking about the banana
[22:45] maushu: I meant the banana.
[22:46] maushu: I wonder how you didn't care about "tasty".
[22:46] zorzar has joined the channel
[22:46] flukes1 has joined the channel
[22:47] jimt_ has joined the channel
[22:47] bingomanatee: okay so my take away is this - both Mongo and Couch have partitioning solutions. Mongo might be a little faster with itst straight binary feed, but Couch has built-in archives. 
[22:47] bingomanatee: Is that a fair summary?
[22:47] flukes1: test-tls-securepair-client test fails on latest git - is this a known / platform specific thing?
[22:47] tilgovi: bingomanatee: no built in archives. false.
[22:47] tilgovi: MVCC != history.
[22:47] chapel: bingomanatee: you can build a simple archive system though
[22:48] maushu: bingomanatee, archives?
[22:48] tilgovi: you can build it, but it's not provided.
[22:48] chapel: yeah
[22:48] bingomanatee: Okay so that is not a discriminatory feature.
[22:48] chapel: people assume _rev = archives
[22:48] chapel: but those are purged on a compaction
[22:48] maushu: You mean versioning?
[22:48] bingomanatee: okay - so the archive system in couch is a temporary conceit. 
[22:48] bingomanatee: yeah. 
[22:48] maushu: Like mongodb has for gridfs?
[22:48] bingomanatee: So in both cases I have to implement versioning by hand.
[22:48] chapel: but bingomanatee its really easy to just store past revisions as an attachment
[22:49] bingomanatee: I figured. 
[22:49] chapel: http://blog.couchone.com/post/632718824/simple-document-versioning-with-couchdb << bingomanatee
[22:49] bingomanatee: Obviously versioning is not the biggest obstacle here. 
[22:49] tilgovi: mongo *is* a lot faster if your dataset fits in RAM (some of this is illusory and a difference in the sync/flush and write guarantees). Once you overflow RAM I imagine they're quite similar.
[22:49] maushu: Have you seen this? http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Comparing+Mongo+DB+and+Couch+DB
[22:50] zorzar has joined the channel
[22:50] chapel: well I prefer couchdb's way of doing mapreduce
[22:50] tilgovi: chapel: I prefer writing erlang to writing C++ and I'm hot for internals, not use cases, so I'm gonna duck out of this discussion.
[22:51] bingomanatee: Okay - how about text searches? can you search for text inside a field in couch?
[22:51] maushu: bingomanatee, for versioning in mongodb just create a multiple key with id and date/version and then limit(1) while searching for the id and order by date/version.
[22:51] tilgovi: bingomanatee: couchdb-lucene
[22:51] bingomanatee: sweet. 
[22:51] maushu: Or solr?
[22:51] bingomanatee: see thats a win. 
[22:51] bbttxu has joined the channel
[22:51] bingomanatee: yeah I figured I'd eventually have to roll in solr.

[22:52] bingomanatee: the couchdb-lucene developer?
[22:52] tilgovi: yeah
[22:52] bingomanatee: well - is it stable?
[22:52] bingomanatee: Because you have squat in that area for Mongo - its pretty much DIY. 
[22:52] chapel: yeah its stable as far as I know
[22:52] bingomanatee: maushu - yes
[22:52] chapel: check out cloudants implementation
[22:53] bingomanatee: Interesting. 
[22:53] bingomanatee: How thorough/accurate do you guys find nosql.com?
[22:53] sechrist has joined the channel
[22:54] tilgovi: ACTION never actually looked at it.
[22:54] tilgovi: twitter/irc is my nosql.com
[22:54] bingomanatee: no - thats not the site. 
[22:54] chapel: Couch uses a clever index building scheme to generate indexes which support particular queries.  There is an elegance to the approach, although one must predeclare these structures for each query one wants to execute.  One can think of them as materialized views. << thats the key imo
[22:54] tilgovi: chapel's got it right.
[22:54] bingomanatee: Is there a good nondenominational nosql news site?
[22:55] tilgovi: hehe. nondenominational. we're not that zealous are we?
[22:55] bingomanatee: I'm not trying to personalize the question. I have wanted to do a site like that and was wondering if there was a player in the space already. 
[22:55] chapel: tilgovi: and their saying that its a downside because mongo does it all dynamic, but you can send temporary views or even save them for further use
[22:56] sudoer has joined the channel
[22:56] deepthawtz has joined the channel
[22:56] chapel: Both CouchDB and MongoDB support map/reduce operations.  For CouchDB map/reduce is inherent to the building of all views.  With MongoDB, map/reduce is only for data processing jobs but not for traditional queries.

[22:57] chapel: couchapps are like making an app directly on the db
[22:57] amirpc has joined the channel
[22:57] amirpc: using socket.io websockets does it somehow disable timer events when socket data is pending?
[22:57] chapel: instead of using something like ruby
[22:57] amirpc: I'm seeing my render loop stays interrupted while data is being processed from the server on my websocket client
[22:58] chapel: because with couchdb you can render your data as any format you want basically
[22:58] chapel: like html, xml, custom uml
[22:58] chapel: has binary attachment support
[22:58] bingomanatee: interesting. 
[22:59] tilgovi: yeah. couchdb is an html5/js application server as well as a database.
[22:59] bingomanatee: sounds nodey. 
[22:59] chapel: if you want to see what is awesome about couchapps, this is the next step http://kansojs.org/
[22:59] tilgovi: that's one of the things that makes it more interesting to me and makes me not care nearly as much about performance.
[22:59] replz_ has joined the channel
[22:59] bingomanatee: That would kind of blow my clients mind but it would be a fun tool. 
[22:59] replz_: wow these captachs are hard to solve..
[23:00] Lorentz: replz_: It wouldn't be hard if you weren't a robot
[23:00] Lorentz: Robot
[23:00] tilgovi: chapel: kansojs looks cool. I hadn't seen it. Thanks.
[23:00] chapel: yeah its new
[23:00] chapel: caolanm made it
[23:00] replz_: Lorentz: are you calling me a robot?
[23:00] chapel: still wip
[23:00] chapel: but if you want to do a couchapp, it just makes sense
[23:00] Lorentz: replz_: We're all robots here
[23:01] chapel: since one issue with couchapps is having to write views in two places
[23:01] chapel: as _shows and on the client
[23:01] saschagehlich: does fs.readSync(fd, length, position, encoding) really return the amount of bytes that have been read? where does the data go then?
[23:01] replz_: Lorentz: I am a human
[23:02] replz_: Lorentz: and i have a question
[23:02] bingomanatee: Just another replicant poser. 
[23:02] BillyBreen has joined the channel
[23:02] Lorentz: replz_: I will assume thing question is for me
[23:03] bingomanatee: Kansjs.org looks cool - I think I want to hold out on that til I get the basic model comfortable. 
[23:03] bingomanatee: But I like the flat stack approach. 
[23:03] mikeal: there is also node.couchapp.js
[23:03] replz_: how would you go about running a file (that creates a server) from a repl, and would that allow me to re-evaluate functions that would affect server behaviour at runtime?
[23:03] mikeal: it's less abstract, really close to the exact design doc structure with a sync tool
[23:04] chapel: yeah mikeal
[23:04] chapel: btw I told caolanm what you said
[23:04] chapel: he was going to look into what could be shared
[23:04] mikeal: yeah, i'd like to know what he said
[23:04] replz_: Lorentz: no, questions are for all the rob.. uuuh.. humans
[23:04] bingomanatee: I do want to ease in to the nodejs/kansjs approach - gotta hook them on the repo before I go obliterating their crappy PHP stack. 
[23:04] mikeal: like, if node.couchapp.js is doing something that prevents him from using it over the hood
[23:04] chapel: he did say that he doesn't do it exactly the same
[23:04] Lorentz: replz_: Good, because I don't know the answer
[23:04] mikeal: then i would consider than a bug
[23:04] mikeal: s/than/that
[23:04] chapel: yeah
[23:05] chapel: he comes on here often, caolanm on here
[23:05] mikeal: the goal is to get is less opinionated and really low level so you can build stuff like kanso without writing sync tools
[23:05] flukes1: how do I get node tests to output debug stuff
[23:05] bingomanatee: console.log?
[23:05] mikeal: flukes1: console.log :)
[23:05] bingomanatee: or file system log writing.
[23:05] flukes1: doesn't seem to be getting out to the console
[23:05] mikeal: or console.err will block
[23:05] bingomanatee: sys.out
[23:05] sechrist has joined the channel
[23:05] mikeal: which is good fro debugging
[23:05] bingomanatee: or like I said - traditional result file logging.
[23:06] bingomanatee: the old ways are the best. 
[23:06] chapel: but yeah bingomanatee couchdb really is awesome, it isn't going to work for everything
[23:06] chapel: but once you get a hang of it, its really awesome
[23:06] flukes1: test-tls-server-verify seems to output nothing
[23:06] bingomanatee: Well my main concerns is I have a client with two develoers - one of whom he hates - and partitioning and scaling concerns. 
[23:06] flukes1: even if I manually insert a console.log at the top
[23:07] bingomanatee: I kind of need a package that takes care of that - I don't discriminate between a single package or a suite 
[23:07] masahiroh has joined the channel
[23:07] flukes1: does it do that if the test succeeds?
[23:07] bingomanatee: I just don't want to play DBA to a small house and just chop up their SQL tables becuase that is old and weak and lame. 
[23:08] chapel: bingomanatee: well you could potentially do the full stack as a couchapp
[23:08] chapel: oh bingomanatee
[23:08] chapel: _changes
[23:08] chapel: you really should look into _changes
[23:08] chapel: :)
[23:08] bingomanatee: I do like the integrated couch app stack and do want to downstream a node/nodesque scheme but I can't see dumping all of that new tech in one revision. 
[23:09] bingomanatee: that is cool. 
[23:09] psema4_ has joined the channel
[23:09] bingomanatee: Keep in mind for rev. 1 I am sure that sql will stay the system of record - I am basically using noSQL to slide out memcache and moving on from there.

[23:29] mscdex: :S

[23:39] nolan_d: Let me rm my repo and try again.
[23:39] nooder: nolan_d, no problem for me on master

[23:53] micheil: erm, let me explain by write buffers, /I mean, write the data to a buffer (read array) first, then write out to disk
[23:53] ryah: well it's going to the thread pool for each write
[23:53] sechrist has joined the channel
[23:53] ryah: it has it all buffered
[23:53] ryah: it should be able to do it in one or two
[23:53] micheil: like writing to http

[23:54] micheil: or something.

[23:54] slickplaid: split the file into 2-4 parts, writing to each async then merge it into one file? heh i dunno
[23:54] flukes1: test-tls-securepair-client seems to fail because server.stdout.on('data', ... doesn't get the "ACCEPT" which openssl sends to stdout
[23:55] micheil: either setTimeout or process.nextTick it.
[23:55] flukes1: on my machine at least. does anyone have this test working?
[23:55] slickplaid: Can someone help me understand how to render *only* the partial and not include the layout in Express? https://gist.github.com/96c110a0aba02e4a8424
[23:55] micheil: ryah: read: eventual write to disk.
[23:56] warz has joined the channel
[23:56] micheil: add an option to WriteStream delay, if set to 0, automatically flushes to disk, otherwise, it sets a timeout to call flush after.
[23:56] tjholowaychuk: slickplaid: render(path, { layout: false })
[23:56] tjholowaychuk: might do the trick
[23:57] micheil: if another write call happens before then, clear the old timeout and set a new one

[23:58] ryah: yes
[23:58] sechrist has joined the channel
[23:58] tjholowaychuk: slickplaid: it should work, partials are still just regular templates

[23:59] slickplaid: Awesome. works great, thanks tjholowaychuk. :D
[23:59] flukes1: running it manually from terminal, it does print ACCEPT
[23:59] ryah: flukes1: openssl s_server has a bug prior to 1.0.0 which does not flush the "ACCEPT" 
[23:59] ryah: flukes1: but only on pipes
[23:59] ryah: flukes1: pipe it to cat
[23:59] micheil: ryah: okay, I'll have a to you soon, I think.
[23:59] flukes1: wow, that's one specific bug. ok thanks
