[00:03] isaacs: TooTallNate: that's odd.
[00:03] isaacs: TooTallNate: can you download http://registry.npmjs.org/npm/-/npm-1.0.13.tgz?
[00:04] TooTallNate: yes, very odd. and 'tar xzvf' extracts the file fine
[00:04] TooTallNate: cloning, and 'make install' worked, however...

[00:06] zeade: TooTallNate: the one-liner npm install didn't work for me on OSX either, I ended up using the MacPorts version
[00:06] bajeczka has joined the channel
[00:07] TooTallNate: zeade: thanks, yes very strange. Hopefully isaacs can figure it out
[00:07] TooTallNate: I thought you used a mac though, isaacs?
[00:07] tauren: anyone here using jade? I know how to precompile jade templates into javascript functions. But how can I save these compiled functions to a file so that I load them into a browser? I'd rather do that then run jade client-side.
[00:07] Cover|Work: joyent is a solaris shop
[00:07] zeade: whoa...
[00:07] Cover|Work: might also depend on osx version
[00:08] TooTallNate: tauren: usually, you'd execute the jade template repeadedly
[00:08] TooTallNate: *repeatedly
[00:08] quackquack: tjholowaychuk: could I see an example model using mongodb w/o mongoose?
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: quackquack i dont touch that stuff
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: mongodb doesn't have models
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: it's just documents
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: there's no restriction in form, that's up to you
[00:08] quackquack: so you dont use a model in your code?
[00:08] Marak has joined the channel
[00:09] ichilton has joined the channel
[00:09] tjholowaychuk: we use mongoose
[00:09] Marak: tbranyen: https://github.com/nodejitsu/http-server
[00:09] tauren: TooTallNate: right -- so wouldn't it make sense to precompile them into javascript and serve them as javascript functions to the client?
[00:09] Marak: tbranyen: npm install http-server -g
[00:09] quackquack: isnt mongoose for building models?
[00:09] ParadoxQuine: tjholowaychuk: is there a way to get more verbose (or just more) errors out of express configuration? i often try to use a compiler (say, for coffeescript) and it silently does nothing
[00:09] sudhirjonathan has joined the channel
[00:10] TooTallNate: quackquack: Schema's is the wording
[00:10] TooTallNate: and just look at the mongoose examples in the repo
[00:10] brianseeders has joined the channel
[00:10] TooTallNate: it's really straightforward
[00:10] ParadoxQuine: anyone know the name of the project that lets you edit CSS and refreshes it in your browser automatically. it used node for the serverside watching..
[00:11] quackquack: TooTallNate: I am looking at it but their arent any validation examples
[00:11] tbranyen: Marak: tht wasn't three hours bro
[00:11] tbranyen: felt like an eternity
[00:11] TooTallNate: what do you mean validation? that's what defining the types is for?

[00:12] TooTallNate: then use schema.path('prop').set(function() {...})
[00:12] TooTallNate: quackquack:
[00:12] severla: tjholowaychuk: script(src:"path") --> this syntax not yet supported? i mean : instead of = for attrs
[00:12] TooTallNate: ^
[00:13] tjholowaychuk: severla it was removed
[00:13] xerox: where does one put the form inputs names and values in a POST request with this? https://github.com/mikeal/request
[00:13] severla: :S
[00:13] tjholowaychuk: : is gets in the way of namespacing
[00:13] Cover|Work: too haml like
[00:13] severla: yeah
[00:13] xerox: beats me
[00:13] quackquack: TooTallNate: sorry, i'm confused, what does the path method do
[00:13] severla: cool change anyway ... thou i've got to change dozens of files
[00:13] bitwise_: xerox: in the body parameter
[00:14] tjholowaychuk: severla i might end up adding an option, we have lots using : as well
[00:14] xerox: bitwise_: and how does one encode it?

[00:15] bitwise_: and the callback at the end
[00:15] quackquack: okay, so once you validate it and get an error, how do you identify which validation threw the error
[00:15] xerox: and other not url-friendly symbols as well
[00:15] bitwise_: good q
[00:15] xerox: mmm
[00:15] Murvin: isaacs:  I'm still working on the sample and testing it (for socket issue).  I will post the code tmr.

[00:16] jscheel has joined the channel
[00:16] quackquack: TooTallNate: is there any way to identify the failing validation on a save?
[00:17] TooTallNate: quackquack:  If an error happens, your Model#save callback receives it.
[00:17] johnnywengluu: could someone explain what fs and buffer is: fs.writeSync(fd, buffer, offset, length, position)
[00:17] quackquack: right, but how do I know which field the error was on
[00:17] johnnywengluu: cant get it by reading the doc
[00:17] Murvin: isaacs:  because not only there is one major issue I mentioned, but some other things I observed.  I will also write it up in details. :)
[00:17] TooTallNate: there's probably some property on the error object, I'm not sure to be honest
[00:18] tbranyen: woot making stuffed shells
[00:18] tjholowaychuk: stuffed shells?
[00:18] quackquack: TooTallNate: this is the output http://www.pastie.org/2080287
[00:19] ngs has joined the channel
[00:19] TooTallNate: quackquack: so the `errors` property then
[00:19] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: egg whites and ricotta mixed with asiago and romano stuffed into shell pasta and baked with red sauce and mozzarella
[00:19] TooTallNate: anything in that object had failed validation
[00:19] tjholowaychuk: haha
[00:19] quackquack: but how do I know which validation it fails if there are more than one?
[00:20] TooTallNate: tbranyen: sounds good!
[00:20] quackquack: w/o regex matching the message, cause thats sort of a hack :P
[00:20] tbranyen: another stuffed shell is cat /dev/urandom
[00:20] TooTallNate: the message only says 'Validation failed'
[00:20] TooTallNate: there's nothing useful there :p
[00:20] TooTallNate: How about doing : "Object.keys(err.errors)"
[00:21] TooTallNate: That'll give you an array of the properties that failed validation
[00:21] quackquack: how do I know if the error on the username was because it was too short or it had a space in it?
[00:22] TooTallNate: I guess passing a _useful_ err string to the validate() function (3rd arg)
[00:22] quackquack: ! i didnt know their was a 3rd arg. can you point me to some docs on that?
[00:24] pyrony has joined the channel

[00:25] Roelven has joined the channel

[00:25] ParadoxQuine: anyone here use vogue and express (with stylus) together?
[00:25] TooTallNate: quackquack: oh yeah, well it's the second arg then
[00:25] ParadoxQuine: i'm having trouble getting vogue to work with stylus
[00:25] tjholowaychuk: what's vogue
[00:26] quackquack: but I would have to parse the second arg out, it is embedded in the message in Validator...failed for path email
[00:26] ParadoxQuine: tjholowaychuk: it auto-reloads css changes without a refresh
[00:27] TooTallNate: quackquack: hhmmm, idk if there's a way to do that short of parsing the string, unfortunately
[00:27] zeade: are there persuasive marketecture (marketing numbers blah blah + architecture design) on competitive advantages of node.js vs other platforms?  for instance if i was sold on using JS as a language why not use spidermonkey guts?
[00:28] tjholowaychuk: ParadoxQuine hmm i've seen smaller solutions that should be better
[00:28] tjholowaychuk: can't remember the names though

[00:29] TooTallNate: http://david.dojotoolkit.org/recss.html
[00:29] SubStack: zeade: but starting with the conclusion and then working backwards to arrive at an argument taints the whole endeavor anyways
[00:30] quackquack: tjholowaychuk, ParadoxQuine: there otta be a chrome plugin to do the css reload, though I dont know its name
[00:30] igl has joined the channel
[00:30] zeade: SubStack: not sure I understand what you mean by that
[00:30] tjholowaychuk: you can just reload on a timeout, unless you are super fast or super slow at editing it's fine IMO
[00:30] tjholowaychuk: and it's like 3 lines

[00:33] hermanjunge: for other rooms, there are not logs available from freenode.net doing some commands?
[00:33] TooTallNate: quackquack: you should open a Mongoose Issue describing your situation. That functionality should be there IMO
[00:34] chapel: tjholowaychuk: what is your canvas image crop/resizer?
[00:34] quackquack: TooTallNate: alright, I will. im afraid I will have a rough time explaining it though :P
[00:34] tjholowaychuk: chapel not sure what you mean
[00:34] chapel: was it you?
[00:34] ParadoxQuine: quackquack, tjholowaychuk: true, though if i could have it update the css without reloading the page it makes it much easier to edit popups and overlays, etc
[00:34] tjholowaychuk: chapel we use GM in LearnBoost
[00:34] tjholowaychuk: for right now
[00:34] chapel: gm?
[00:35] tjholowaychuk: but we could use node-canvas
[00:35] TooTallNate: you could use node-canvas for simple image resizing though, easy
[00:35] chapel: what about cropping?
[00:35] tjholowaychuk: ParadoxQuine: yeah, you can do that with an interval as well
[00:35] quackquack: TooTallNate: oh! someone beat me to it: https://github.com/LearnBoost/mongoose/issues/368

[00:43] MooGoo: or I could spend time learning a useless language that does nothing really

[00:43] tjholowaychuk: -> is lame
[00:43] bitwise_: and my curl: curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/post-logger -d "foo=fa"
[00:44] ParadoxQuine: tjholowaychuk: do you use snippets and such then instead?

[02:19] chbrown: Question about websites with http.createServer: as far as I can tell, you have to start listening to request.on('data', ...) on the very first event that createServer starts; if you start listening in some callback down the line, you'll probably not get any data. But what if I check for the authority of the requesting user within a callback-calling database lookup, and don't want to start listening for data until I have certified th
[02:19] chbrown: is logged in? 
[02:20] Tobsn: hu?
[02:21] Tobsn: the further down is probably a scope issue
[02:21] Tobsn: authority is what? http auth?
[02:21] Tobsn: you still have to accept the request to know what was sent
[02:21] chbrown: Tobsn: no, a mongodb lookup.
[02:21] Tobsn: still a scope issue
[02:21] chbrown: Right, and I'm fine accepting the request.
[02:22] Tobsn: but?
[02:22] chbrown: But— it seems like a security hole if I start listening for posted data from just any connection. Somebody could launch a lot of streams of data, megabytes each, and since my server has to capture it all, it'd be trivial to max out the memory allotted to my server instance.
[02:22] chbrown: Easiest DDoS ever.

[02:25] skm has joined the channel
[02:26] chbrown: The best solution I've been able to think up so far is to have my req.on('data', ...) listening function periodically check that the request has not yet been refused authentication.
[02:27] chbrown: Once the request has failed authentication, it would set request.stop = true, and my listening function would stop as soon as it saw that field had been set.

[02:29] Tobsn: for a stream

[02:29] Tobsn: but for plain HTTP... well thats how the intertubes work.
[02:29] Tobsn: you cant tell how big it is before its uploaded
[02:29] Tobsn: or requested etc.
[02:30] Tobsn: but for a GET request, browsers only support up to around 1000 chars, if you try that over curl... no clue.
[02:30] Tobsn: also if your RAM is full it will start swapping
[02:31] Tobsn: if you have 250GB in your server someone needs to send you POST data worth the space on your disk to really freeze up the system
[02:31] Tobsn: and i rather believe that the requests will just get dropped

[02:35] chbrown: True. I could set client_max_body_size in my nginx server setting to something reasonable, like 10MB. But if I'm running on a little 500MB RAM linode, it'd only take a pretty stout uplink from one client to curl-POST me 10MB streams at a concurrency of 50 to use up all that RAM.

[03:37] rpj8: tonymilne: I'm creating a timer whose values will be send over a websocket to the client. And yes I do need setTimeout
[03:38] rpj8: chbrown: ohhhhhhh
[03:38] rpj8: oh oh
[03:38] gkatsev: :)
[03:38] rpj8: is that because it gets set to the this.time function?

[03:40] rpj8: tonymilne: mmmm I don't think so, really.
[03:40] tonymilne: lol. ok.
[03:41] rpj8: I mean, maybe, but it intuitively makes sense for my script.
[03:41] rpj8: since i'm sending data back to the client every 1 second anyway as a timer.
[03:41] rpj8: it's meant to be in a game sort-of format
[03:42] tonymilne: yep, so, my point is - if you're doing it at a set interval, e.g. 1 second... then use setInterval.. vs if the seconds timeout is arbitrarily changing, then use setTimeout.

[04:32] mawkor2: see the danger now?
[04:32] mawkor2: i mean, if you are careful on the server side you should be fine
[04:33] mawkor2: just don't run any functions that are passed from the client
[04:33] rabidewok: or if you trust the client ;)
[04:33] mawkor2: however then it's not really bi-directional
[04:33] mawkor2: yeah...
[04:33] rabidewok: so...basically if you're writing an application for yourself
[04:33] tonymilne: i dont trust myself!

[04:46] jamescarr__: at my workplace... it's to help prep for the half day workshop I'm doing at uberconf next month
[04:46] jerrysv: or set up a copy of npm locally, publish to it
[04:47] jcummins: jesusabdullah: Yeah, I was afraid you were going to say that.  `node link` seems like a hack.  I wish I could list a git repo as a dependency.  That'd be awesome.

[07:43] niftylettuce: SubStack: we have plugins like jWYSIWYG, jquery-color, and a jquery color picker etc etc
[07:44] niftylettuce: SubStack: up until jwysiwyg, each plugin was in its own js file, but jwysiwyg has several sub-plugins for things like including links, file manager, image uploader, inside the wysiwyg
[07:44] niftylettuce: https://raw.github.com/akzhan/jwysiwyg see /controls folder
[07:45] niftylettuce: heres my package.json file http://pastie.org/private/h35ruxazqzkkl4jdky39ta
[07:46] niftylettuce: the browserify.js is just the "main" wrapped with what I said at 03:41 EST
[07:46] SubStack: you can specify a base in your browserify field in your package.json
[07:46] SubStack: so you can require('module/submodule')

[09:17] tuhoojabotti: :P

[09:18] tuhoojabotti: the server stalls again

[09:22] indutny: jamey-uk: it's couchdb, actually
[09:22] jamey-uk: tuhoojabotti: your server redirects me to /index/ but then it gives no response...
[09:23] tuhoojabotti: jamey-uk: Yes well I know.
[09:23] jamey-uk: indutny: what needs to be restarted?
[09:23] tuhoojabotti: The redirect is apache ;D
[09:23] jamey-uk: is it a forever redirect or something?
[09:23] indutny: jamey-uk: Probably, couchdb.
[09:23] tuhoojabotti: jamey-uk: It's like I don't visit the site for a day then I visit it and it works and soon after that boom

[09:24] jamey-uk: What's it hosted on?
[09:24] tuhoojabotti: jamey-uk: A servr
[09:24] tuhoojabotti: server*
[09:24] jamey-uk: …what kind of server, what sort of software aside from Apache
[09:24] tuhoojabotti: Well lot's of software
[09:24] tuhoojabotti: it's not my own

[10:09] blackpawn_: thanks Marak  i'll try that!

[10:10] jamey-uk: ACTION is pretty happy npm is back up
[10:10] stonebranch has joined the channel
[10:10] Marak: blackpawn_: you need to increase ulimit, also you might benefit from a rate limiter on your control flow, as to not saturate the machine with too many file i/o at once
[10:10] blackpawn_: oh are you kidding npm is back? haha if only 4 hours ago
[10:11] blackpawn_: marak i haven't been able to figure out how to rate limit since there's no sleep API or anything like that
[10:11] blackpawn_: it's all async input feeding async output...
[10:11] Marak: blackpawn_: its not hard, i think there are some libs that do this, i cant remember
[10:11] rjack: Marak: thanks
[10:11] meso_ has joined the channel
[10:11] Marak: blackpawn_: if you cant dynamically scale up your processes, you need to rate limit 
[10:12] Marak: blackpawn_: but just up your ulimit, i bet it will hold
[10:12] blackpawn_: yeah running again with 1024 instead of 256 ulimit
[10:12] Marak: blackpawn_: and TRIPLE check you are closing FDs ( both file i/o and http requests...)
[10:12] Marak: req.end() will kill you
[10:12] Marak: if i remember right, its been a while since ive seen that error in our stack

[10:34] Skola: I mean, within a 79 char limit of course
[10:35] Skola: but even if something can be written on one line, is it desirable to always give certain code it's own line?

[10:45] tuhoojabotti: hoi
[10:46] Skola: there are some cases where I have my doubts though
[10:46] Skola: like:
[10:46] Skola: _(string.replace /[^a-zA-Z0-9| ]/g, '').words().join('_')
[10:46] Skola: I mean, it does exactly what it should, but maybe it's not so readable
[10:46] gustavowt has joined the channel
[10:47] jonaslund: is _ a magic token like in perl ?
[10:48] Skola: no it's underscore.js
[10:48] Skola: should have mentioned
[10:48] tuhoojabotti: What does that do? :o
[10:49] Skola: it changes "Some#*@&@*#&__ fucked up String" to "Some_fucked_up_String"

[10:49] fcambus has joined the channel
[10:49] Skola: but the fact that you need to ask makes me wonder whether it's readable enough
[10:49] tuhoojabotti: ok.
[10:50] Skola: I use it to get url-friendly titles in this case
[10:50] tuhoojabotti: That's useful!
[10:50] tuhoojabotti: though I use -

[10:55] tuhoojabotti: quite common phrase
[10:55] Skola: nub? :D
[10:56] tuhoojabotti: no it's english

[11:09] leonh: jonaslund: I remember there was a plugin for irssi to hide join/parts of users idle for an amount of time so that you only see join/parts of people actually talking.
[11:09] Skola: must find this

[11:10] leonh: I find irssi a pain to use
[11:10] leonh: but yeah, it's got a plugin or script for everything

[12:18] lukegalea: morning all. Does anyone know of a Node.js tool to inline CSS for sending emails? (ie: The Node equivelent of this ruby project: https://github.com/alexdunae/premailer)
[12:20] Bwen: inline CSS for sending emails? that just didnt compute, to me...
[12:20] tojochacko has joined the channel
[12:20] lukegalea: Bwen: If you just toss a style tag at the top of an html email, gmail, etc will ignore.
[12:20] lukegalea: probably because you could mess up their page.
[12:21] ph^ has joined the channel
[12:21] lukegalea: but if you put all your styles in each element's style=xxx then it's fine.

[12:21] lukegalea: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4894081/compile-css-into-html-as-inline-styles
[12:21] Bwen: so basicly you want a tool to modify your well sorted CSS and put it inline your HTML email tags
[12:22] Bwen: that could be done in any language...
[12:22] bnoordhuis has joined the channel
[12:22] nphase-work has joined the channel
[12:22] Bwen: once you have your Email HTML in a file, just have node send it and parse the markers
[12:23] Bwen: and if its so important, why not just create your Email HTML with inline styles in the first place ...
[12:23] lukegalea: I'm rendering the emails using express... and the email content itself is dynamic, so the template could have inline styles but the I would have to put ugly raw styles into the dynamic templates themselves to do that..
[12:23] lukegalea: bu

[12:24] lukegalea: Bwen: thanks for talking it through with me.
[12:24] Bwen: lukegalea: why create so much Overhead just to be "proper" ... 
[12:24] Bwen: create your HTML with inline styles... that HOW you want it anyway...
[12:25] hkjels_: That probably involves changing your workflow. I'm pretty sure I've seen a solution for your issue lukegalea, but no address comes to mind
[12:25] lukegalea: Bwen: Not so much about being proper as being maintainable.

[15:52] cyberian2: tbranyen: thanks... i'll check it out
[15:52] kuya: anyone know when pubsub.io is being released? i want to see it!
[15:52] tbranyen: cyberian2: once its set up you can do authbind node server.js
[15:52] rendez: mscdex: hey
[15:52] tuhoojabotti: Wohoo
[15:52] tuhoojabotti: Finally at home!
[15:52] tuhoojabotti: Time to get to real work (tm)
[15:52] mscdex: rendez: yep?
[15:53] dtan_: does Express recognize changes to js files or do you need to restart the server per each change?
[15:53] cyberian2: tbranyen: i saw two prominent solutions....proxying with nginx, and start as root and change user
[15:53] tbranyen: cyberian2: authbind is easier than both
[15:53] tbranyen: imo
[15:53] cyberian2: tbranyen: cool it sounds like it
[15:53] cyberian2: tbranyen: from the name it sounds like the latter
[15:54] rendez: mscdex: I got it working! https://gist.github.com/4f05f9f681eddd074d52
[15:54] rendez: basically is one-time stream write, with EOF
[15:54] ekryski: dtan_: express usually recognizes it but if you make changes to app itself you need to restart the server.  I usually just restart it anyway or test all my changes on another server and then move to my production one.
[15:54] rendez: seems to trigger the right events

[15:59] rendez: but it will timeout when clock > 50000 ms
[16:00] rendez: so that's the biggest you can PUT in the ftp server as a user
[16:00] chunhao: is there something like sprintf in nodejs?
[16:00] rendez: nodejs timeout is 50000ms isn't it?
[16:00] rendez: chunhao, not natively
[16:00] Cover|Work: chunhao: no, you have to concatenate with +
[16:00] ekryski: Does anyone know how require nested modules without making the module directory structure use symlinks?
[16:00] jamey-uk: dtan_: use node-dev (npm install node-dev)

[16:07] qbert: devinus, huh ?
[16:07] jamey-uk: ekryski: yeah, there's quite a bit of old or conflicting documentation on the web for it :/
[16:08] ekryski: jamey-uk: Ya I've started to notice that about a few of the modules out there.
[16:08] jamey-uk: Yeah, most infurating… and then npm was down for yesterday and today, so happy it's back
[16:09] ekryski: the best thing you can do to help the community though is when you figure it out do a quick readme writeup and submit it as a pull request on github.

[16:30] gustavowt: i needo to execute system calls on node server script, someone can indicate a tool?
[16:31] xerox: gustavowt: system calls that are not already covered by node?
[16:31] Bwen: qbert: I think I know why... 2mins
[16:31] Cover|Work: xerox: should be ok, as long as you don't keep references to it alive outside scope
[16:31] cyberian2: tbranyen: I've installed authbind and created the file /etc/authbind/byport/80 and chmodded it to have executable permission by my user but it still gives me ENOENT
[16:31] Cover|Work: it depends on what's in require
[16:32] gustavowt: xerox, idont konw, how i use this?
[16:32] qbert: Bwen, good please share
[16:32] bogomips2_: qbert, i used npm install websocket-server@latest i don't know the real path .. i think /usr/local/...

[16:32] adrianmg has joined the channel
[16:32] prettyrobots has joined the channel
[16:33] qbert: bogomips2_, the NPM installs dependencies at the project level so I would check where it actually is
[16:33] qbert: the new npm rather
[16:33] qbert: what version are you using ?
[16:33] Cover|Work: for example, express does a require() inside the functions to load the template engines
[16:34] broofa has joined the channel
[16:34] Cover|Work: but it also caches it so it doesn't need to re-require it
[16:35] DTrejo has joined the channel
[16:35] xerox: Cover|Work: sounds good
[16:36] sub_pop has joined the channel
[16:36] tuhoojabotti: Doesn't require have internal cache?
[16:36] dtan_: does express have a mongodb connection by default or is that something that needs to be built after installation?
[16:37] bogomips2_: node v0.4.8, npm 1.0.13
[16:37] Cover|Work: tuhoojabotti: it does, but i think it runs the required module each time and returns the result
[16:37] Bwen: qbert: I was testing... its not what I though.. hmmm.. this is bugging me :@
[16:37] tuhoojabotti: Dunno
[16:37] Cover|Work: a = require("a"); b = require("b") should become two separate objects
[16:37] bergie has joined the channel
[16:37] Cover|Work: if the module needs that
[16:37] topaxi has joined the channel
[16:37] qbert: bogomips, yeah that installs at the project level unless you specify --global , I'd make sure that it gets installed at your project root dir
[16:38] qbert: dtan_, no you need the native driver, mongoose , mongolian, theres a lot of wrappers
[16:38] Cover|Work: but in the case of the template engines like jade, etc. they work fine as a singleton, so there is no need to instantiate a new object and take up more memory
[16:38] DTrejo has joined the channel
[16:38] matyr_ has joined the channel
[16:38] dtan_: qbert: which would you recommend?
[16:38] qbert: Cover|Work, tuhoojabotti , Id be interested to no if require does any caching, please share if you find out :)
[16:39] tuhoojabotti: qbert: Well I read the api docs and it says it does
[16:39] qbert: dtan_, I use mongolian because its the closes to the mongo shell, but if you need ORM stuff you might want Mongoose, as far as I know its the most mature
[16:39] tuhoojabotti: That's all I know.
[16:39] Cover|Work: i know for a fact that it does cache
[16:39] qbert: tuhoojabotti, lol ok thanks
[16:39] qbert: <-- needs to rtfm
[16:40] ekryski: dtan_: I'm with qbert on that one.  There are some syntactical quirks in mongoose that don't line up with the mongo shell syntax but it is the most mature
[16:40] Cover|Work: if you require a file, and while that process is running, change the file and re-require it to another object, it won't load the changed file, and simply re-require the old object
[16:41] dtan_: ekryski, qbert: so you guys are saying that mongolian uses similar syntax to the default mongodb shell and that is why you guys mainly like it over mongoose?
[16:42] willwhite has joined the channel
[16:43] ekryski: dtan_: I personally use mongoose (and that's what I would recommend) because it is the most mature.  I haven't really used mongolian but I know that some of mongoose's syntax is slightly different.  For the most part it follows the mongo shell conventions.
[16:43] Tidwell_: I'm getting an "Unterminated String Constant" error in ie8 when using socket.io - anyone experienced this before?
[16:44] dtan_: gotcha
[16:44] Cover|Work: Tidwell_: usually get that error if you have a newline in a string
[16:44] gustavowt: someone already used child_proccess
[16:44] gustavowt: ?
[16:45] Cover|Work: String constants (when evaluated from source) cannot have literal newlines
[16:45] Cover|Work: they must be escaped newline characters

[16:53] Cover|Work: if you're converting it to a string to be output, then utf-8 will add some extra characters for invalid values

[17:55] dtan_: i would imagine that you wouldn't want all your app.get's to be in that one app.js file, right?
[17:56] tjholowaychuk: dtan_ lots of different techniques you can use
[17:56] tjholowaychuk: check out some of the examples
[17:56] qbert: dtan_, if you dont specify a path to get() it will just read from the filesystem, so you dont have to specify a path for everything

[18:01] jamey-uk: does anyone know how to limit the file upload size using connect-form or node-formidable?
[18:02] Fodi69: hi, socket.io has a new version (v0.7) on its master branch, and it has two examples, had anyone tried these examples? are they working?
[18:04] Skola: this might be a stupid question, but there must be an "alias" or better way of removing a substring besides string.replace("something", "") ?
[18:05] confoocious has joined the channel
[18:05] context: anyone here running fbsd? whats the config file pkg_add / ports looks at for packages/updating etc
[18:05] Fodi69: Skola: you can write a regexp :D
[18:06] Skola: ja but for basic substring removal it's a bit overkill
[18:07] Fodi69: Skola: if you want, you can write a function for yourself
[18:07] dgathright has joined the channel
[18:07] Skola: sure
[18:07] Skola: rmStr = (string, substring) -> string.replace(substring, '')
[18:07] Fodi69: yeah.
[18:07] Fodi69: thats the answer
[18:07] jamey-uk: how do I cancel or abort a file upload?
[18:07] Skola: but it's so basic
[18:07] Skola: feels a bit silly
[18:07] Cover|Work: is .replace really that difficult to use?
[18:08] Skola: no but why REPLACE something when one wants to REMOVE something
[18:08] uchuff has joined the channel
[18:08] Skola: it's just not elegant
[18:08] Skola: I don't mind that much, but just surprised
[18:08] Fodi69: Skola: you name your function remove, and atach it to the String object.
[18:08] Cover|Work: it's multi-functional
[18:08] Cover|Work: just like splice() is used to remove stuff, but also insert too
[18:09] Skola: ja it's just bad design

[18:11] Fodi69: Skola: you can always write your own function for that and you can name it anything

[19:18] tjholowaychuk: you can curl that url, and it will show you what middleware/routes it goes through
[19:19] tjholowaychuk: or at very worst you can use node's debugger to step through
[19:20] rfay has joined the channel
[19:20] bitwise_: ok, thx. when i node debug app.js, I type run but it stops at the first line of my app. is that expected? step commands seem to go deeper into node's internal workings
[19:21] tjholowaychuk: you can use the debugger keyword
[19:21] tjholowaychuk: and continue to that point
[19:21] tjholowaychuk: not sure if node's can set break points while running, haven't tried
[19:21] tjholowaychuk: im sure it can
[19:21] bitwise_: i didnt set any breakpoints though and its still stopping in some arbitrary lines
[19:22] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: was messing with using the lastIndex property of the regex object and doesn't seem to be any way to use that in a parser, since all regexes need to be global and cannot use ^
[19:22] dtan_: does nodejs support all the console methods you can use in the browser?
[19:22] tjholowaychuk: tbranyen yeah i came across that quickly
[19:22] tjholowaychuk: and realized itwas not at all what i wanted
[19:22] jakeg: dtan_: http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/all.html
[19:22] tjholowaychuk: dtan_ most
[19:22] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: well i mean if it could work with ^ then it would be perfect
[19:23] tjholowaychuk: yeah exactly
[19:23] jakeg: http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/all.html#console
[19:23] tjholowaychuk: we need that offst
[19:23] tjholowaychuk: offset*
[19:23] tbranyen: yep
[19:23] dtan_: cool thanks guys
[19:23] tbranyen: urgh
[19:23] tbranyen: so much for that
[19:23] tjholowaychuk: cant be hard to get that in the spec
[19:23] tjholowaychuk: not like it's a breaking change
[19:23] tjholowaychuk: and it would be a few lines to implement
[19:23] martyziff has joined the channel
[19:23] tbranyen: heh yeah but that would start a tangent about some weird ass ruby syntax to do the same thing
[19:23] tjholowaychuk: just check bounds and increment the damn pointer
[19:24] tjholowaychuk: huh?
[19:24] tbranyen: i'm scared to bring anything up to es.next
[19:24] brfelipe: ive been trying to create a chat app using node and socket.io. The chat detects someone is online, but if i send a message, the message is not broadcasted. I wonder what i am doing wrong: http://pastebin.com/2LTtVTwd
[19:24] tjholowaychuk: just have /^re/.exec(str, offset)
[19:24] tbranyen: oh shit yeah that'd be even nicer
[19:24] patcito has joined the channel
[19:24] jakeg: brfelipe: probabably socket.io version problem

[19:27] eazyigz: what am I doing wrong? 
[19:27] bitwise_: ok so the 404 only seems to appear when i POST. GET req's work fine
[19:27] eazyigz: Seq()             .seq(function() {                 console.log("first");             })             .seq(function() {                 console.log("second");             })           ;
[19:27] tbranyen: using tabs?
[19:28] jakeg: bitwise_: d'oh! app.get() is for get app.post() is for post!!!

[19:34] springmeyer has joined the channel
[19:34] jakeg: brfelipe: "npm rm socket.io && git clone https://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO-node.git socket_07
[19:34] jakeg: you can't npm install 0.7 yet at all, thus the git clone
[19:35] bitwise_: brfelipe: you can cd to your cloned dir and do npm install
[19:35] jamey-uk has left the channel
[19:35] jakeg: bitwise_: to install socket.io-client yeah, not socket.io
[19:35] jakeg: afaik
[19:35] bitwise_: anything with a package.json i think
[19:36] jakeg: yeah, but socket.io 0.7 isn't tagged on npm yet
[19:36] jakeg: so only way to install it is via git clone
[19:36] `3rdEden: ^ it's not released yet thats why :p
[19:36] `3rdEden: HOWEVER
[19:36] `3rdEden: socket.io-client is in npm, with version 0.7 :$
[19:36] `3rdEden: we like to mess with your mind.
[19:37] brfelipe: jakeg: cloned it. so now i just have to fix the require line, right?
[19:37] jakeg: yup so "git clone https://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO-node.git socket_07 && cd socket_07 && npm install ." then require('./socket_07') until 0.7 is on npm

[19:54] fs_: Good evening, I am new to node so I hope it's okay that I ask some newbie questions. I am trying to setup a test environment and found something called jessie which uses jasmine.js. The guides tell me to use the jessie [options] command to run the specs. But now npm installed jessie inside node_modules so if I do jessie in the root of my project my shell doesn't know about it.
[19:54] fs_: So I was wondering how can I tell my shell about jessie?
[19:54] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[19:55] dtan_: fs_ are there any install instructions for jessie?
[19:55] kersny: fs_: one option is to `npm install jessie -g` which will install it globally and put it in your path
[19:55] blueadept: how do you cache views with express?
[19:56] fs_: Is there some option to install them into a virtual environment the way Python does it?

[21:30] T0bsn: https://gist.github.com/953219

[21:32] techwraith: Thanks
[21:32] T0bsn: np
[21:32] xerox: what is that?

[21:33] xerox: what does one know about the chunks
[21:34] xerox: coming in to the callback
[21:34] hellp has joined the channel
[21:35] T0bsn: i pipe the access log to that script - the script gets invoked by lighttpd once on start and stays running awaiting chunks over stdin. everytime there is something coming in i parse it and save the accesslog data to localhost mongodb db logs collection access, where localhost port is a mongos daemon connected with the 9 node mongodb "cluster" i have running
[21:35] T0bsn: the chunk is the text
[21:35] T0bsn: echo "lala" | ./script.js
[21:35] T0bsn: "lala" would be the chunk
[21:35] themiddleman_itv has joined the channel
[21:36] T0bsn: its pretty sweet.
[21:36] T0bsn: ;)
[21:37] xerox: T0bsn it is always all the text?
[21:37] xerox: so it is not a chunk xD
[21:37] T0bsn: sortof
[21:37] T0bsn: if the line is longer than some number it will chunk it i think
[21:37] T0bsn: not sure
[21:38] T0bsn: i think it only says "chunk" cause its from an example
[21:38] xerox: the number is pretty large I guess
[21:38] T0bsn: and im kinda sure it will break it up if its longer
[21:38] T0bsn: yeah should be like 4kb
[21:38] xerox: good to know
[21:38] T0bsn: i think 4kb is the normal EOL limit or something

[22:56] tbranyen: xerox: the cache is only used with the function require... if its in there it returns that object, if its not it loads it from the fs

[23:16] Tobsn: little jquery question... lets say i execute a .get() within a method in a class, kinda like var x = { exec:function(){ $.get( url, function(data){ blah } ); } } is it possible to use this. within the .get callback?
[23:16] qbert: I do it on both
[23:16] Tobsn: or rather javascript question
[23:16] llrcombs: 2 part thing:
[23:16] ArvinJA: qbert, yeah, but it seems like a hassle to get node.io working on wiundows
[23:17] ArvinJA: I don't even know where to begin
[23:17] ArvinJA: Since I am not familiar with how any of this works
[23:17] qbert: Tobsn, depends on what this you want, usually do var self = this; , somewhere and call self.blah();
[23:17] jmoyers: Tobsn not usually by default
[23:17] ArvinJA: There are straightforward guidelines for linux though
[23:17] llrcombs: 1. I'm working on a Node.js HTTP server, is there any way to get the stats of all files in a directory?
[23:17] qbert: ArvinJA, yes def easier on nux
[23:17] llrcombs: 2. CREEPY IMAGES using the script this'll be used in: http://wzom.tk/images/Makeup/
[23:17] qbert: *nix
[23:17] tbranyen: Tobsn: so much wrong terminology in there, but you'd need to assign this to another variable
[23:17] jmoyers: Tobsn var me = this, as qbert said, the other way is to use Function.bind
[23:18] Tobsn: hmm
[23:18] qbert: jmoyers, I see var me = this;  alot, is that the convention ?
[23:18] qbert: naming it me I mean
[23:18] tbranyen: var that = this; is probably more convention
[23:18] jmoyers: self is reserved i think
[23:18] tbranyen: jmoyers: nah its not
[23:18] jmoyers: that = this also
[23:18] tbranyen: its just used in firefox to refer to teh current window
[23:18] tbranyen: but its def overridable
[23:18] tbranyen: and def not reserved in v8
[23:19] Tobsn: var x = { exec:function(){ var t = this; $.get( url, function(data){ t.parse( data ); } ); }, parse:function(data){} }
[23:19] Tobsn: like that?
[23:19] jmoyers: well right
[23:19] jmoyers: self being window
[23:19] tbranyen: Tobsn: t would equal teh function
[23:19] Tobsn: im never sure about this within callbacks
[23:19] jmoyers: seems like something you'd want to avoid
[23:19] tbranyen: jmoyers: why? its just a circular reference
[23:19] sonnym has joined the channel
[23:19] tbranyen: and if you aren't leaking globally
[23:19] tbranyen: no biggie
[23:19] Tobsn: so the only way to get to parse() within the exec is to call it from outside?
[23:19] Tobsn: x.parse() ?
[23:20] tbranyen: Tobsn: or this.parse()
[23:20] jmoyers: i suppose
[23:20] Tobsn: tbranyen, how?
[23:20] Tobsn: this wouldnt exist within the callback?
[23:20] tbranyen: if you call a function off an obj like obj.function `this` inside the function will be the object
[23:20] nibblebot has joined the channel
[23:20] jmoyers: nah
[23:20] jmoyers: not in the case of jquery .get
[23:20] Tobsn: yeah i dont think so either
[23:20] jmoyers: he's talking about nested functions
[23:20] Tobsn: this would be just undefined
[23:20] tbranyen: jmoyers: we already went over that
[23:20] jmoyers: you'd have to bind
[23:21] tbranyen: you don't need bind
[23:21] Tobsn: var x = { exec:function(){ var t = this; $.get( url, function(data){ this.parse( data ); } ); }, parse:function(data){} }
[23:21] Tobsn: i already know that would break
[23:21] Tobsn: this is undefined
[23:21] tbranyen: Tobsn: thats not what you asked
[23:21] Tobsn: hu?
[23:21] tbranyen: t.parse
[23:21] Tobsn: oh
[23:21] Tobsn: i see
[23:21] tbranyen: you assigned this to t

[23:22] Tobsn: var x = { exec:function(){ $.get( url, function(data){ ???.parse( data ); } ); }, parse:function(data){} }

[23:22] tbranyen: Tobsn: are you trolling me
[23:22] Tobsn: at least thats how im normally doing it
[23:22] tbranyen: I just told you
[23:22] tbranyen: t.parse
[23:22] tbranyen: ...
[23:22] tbranyen: i hate talking to walls
[23:22] jmoyers: you can do that.. or bind.
[23:22] Tobsn: you just said that relates to the function
[23:22] jmoyers: if you want this to refer to the right thing
[23:23] Tobsn: any benefits with bind?
[23:23] jmoyers: $.get( url, _.bind(function(data){ this.parse(data); }, this); );
[23:23] jmoyers: other than it not looking like horses ass?
[23:23] jmoyers: not really
[23:23] Tobsn: hmm
[23:23] Tobsn: _ ?
[23:24] zivester_ has joined the channel
[23:24] jmoyers: thats just from underscore, Function.bind is in the latest versions of ecma, no?
[23:24] tbranyen: Yea
[23:24] tbranyen: not x-browser yet
[23:24] jmoyers: underscore wraps it for compat
[23:24] Tobsn: hmm
[23:24] jmoyers: so does, for instance, prototype
[23:24] tbranyen: seems bad to bring in underscore unnecessarily
[23:24] tbranyen: just for bind
[23:24] Tobsn: yeah
[23:24] jmoyers: isn't it in jquery directly yet?
[23:24] Tobsn: dont think so

[23:25] jmoyers: such a weird example

[23:25] Tobsn: yeah that example is weird
[23:25] tauren: req.params.name seems to be truncated by one character when this runs: https://gist.github.com/1032582
[23:25] techwraith: Yes, very weird
[23:26] tauren: request of http://localhost:4000/site/index.html results in name = 'index.htm'
[23:26] tjholowaychuk: tauren that's a weird combo
[23:26] Tobsn: so proxy does binding like underscore does?
[23:26] tjholowaychuk: tauren just use *
[23:26] tbranyen: whats weird about the example?
[23:26] tjholowaychuk: or use :name(*)
[23:27] tauren: tjholowaychuk: how do I get the value of * ?
[23:27] tjholowaychuk: *:name is a soak and a :name
[23:27] jmoyers: its using an object literal
[23:27] tjholowaychuk: not * named "name"
[23:27] niftylettuce has joined the channel
[23:27] tjholowaychuk: req.params[0]
[23:27] tjholowaychuk: or with :name(*) req.params.name
[23:27] jmoyers: then reapplying this, essentially using it like .call
[23:27] tjholowaychuk: :whatever(some regexp here)
[23:27] jmoyers: when the real example is to do something with .get, for instance -- its not a way i'd use it in the real world
[23:27] tauren: tjholowaychuk: so I want to get the whole path, not just one parameter. so using :name(*) will do that?
[23:28] tjholowaychuk: yup
[23:28] tbranyen: jmoyers: the point is binding context, not using call
[23:28] tauren: ok, thanks
[23:28] tjholowaychuk: more or less a named capture group
[23:28] tbranyen: call invokes a function
[23:28] tbranyen: they are not invoking anything
[23:28] Tobsn: how would proxy pass on args?
[23:28] tbranyen: Tobsn: you know there is a jQuery support channel right?
[23:28] tbranyen: #jquery
[23:28] tbranyen: its very good

[23:30] Tobsn: hate it when people are so anal about topics in channels...
[23:31] techwraith: Tobsn: I don't think you can pass args into a proxy, it just gets whatever args are passed to it.

[23:36] jmoyers: for instance, backbone or spine or some such, they use event delegation or something, and have a controller which proxies events off whatever view (jquery etc)
