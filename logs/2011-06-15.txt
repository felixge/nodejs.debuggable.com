[09:45] tuhoojabotti: but 1000,00 beats that :P
[09:45] tuhoojabotti: or 1000.00

[10:18] mendel_: the concept of multiplexing a http connection is  a great one right? or am I missing something
[10:19] tuhoojabotti: "Require node.js version - at least 0.5.0-pre"
[10:19] tuhoojabotti: there's your problem
[10:19] indutny: mendel_: it currently runs only on 0.5.0-pre branch and with latest openssl library
[10:19] indutny: tuhoojabotti: right

[10:30] tuhoojabotti: NuckingFuts: Why?
[10:30] tuhoojabotti: Why would you do that :O
[10:30] NuckingFuts: tuhoojabotti: Because NodeJS is fucking great, because deviantART needs replacing, and because we want to launch in time for deviantART to release v8.
[10:30] NuckingFuts: We expect user outrage at v8
[10:31] NuckingFuts: So we plan to milk it.
[10:31] NuckingFuts: V8 is predicted to launch in Auguest
[10:31] tuhoojabotti: Why deviant art needs replacing? :3
[10:31] NuckingFuts: *August
[10:31] NuckingFuts: tuhoojabotti: Because it's badly managed, falling apart, and social networks cosntantly need a turnover.

[10:40] indutny: NuckingFuts: yes
[10:40] tuhoojabotti: monokrome: That's bad css.

[10:43] monokrome: I know that I can use this: ul(id='music-album-'+album.name)
[10:43] `3rdEden: NuckingFuts it's not a replacement
[10:43] monokrome: But I'd rather use the # syntax if applicable
[10:43] `3rdEden: it's an extension
[10:43] `3rdEden: and it can speed your browsing experiance with more 50%
[10:43] indutny: NuckingFuts: hm... while SPDY itself can have some cons, having NPN inside node.js will be quite interesting for implementing your own protocols
[10:43] AAA_awright: Well it should be the same on both sides right?

[10:48] AAA_awright: With what, exactly?
[10:48] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: So I'
[10:48] AAA_awright: bah
[10:48] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: I call it "fakooda"
[10:48] NuckingFuts: An art site with a state-of-the-art suggestion algorithm
[10:48] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: So I'm writing a Node.js IRC client, that you can access at any time with your web browser, it stays connected
[10:48] NuckingFuts: And a tagging system that doesn't suck ass
[10:49] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: You're doing a DA clone?
[10:49] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: Not clone
[10:49] NuckingFuts: Not at all
[10:49] dipser has joined the channel
[10:49] AAA_awright: Well of course... When you start with a goal of cloning crap, you have no where else to go
[10:49] NuckingFuts: More an improvement.  Looking at dA and saying "what went wrong"
[10:50] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: How about adding some semantics to it, say, with RDF?
[10:50] NuckingFuts: tuhoojabotti: HOLY SHIT.  I shat myself at the ending.
[10:50] tuhoojabotti: Good for you!
[10:50] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: Might do Semantic HTML :S
[10:50] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: well, actually
[10:50] NuckingFuts: Doesn't matter much on the AJAX'ed pages
[10:51] tuhoojabotti: My site is ajaxed
[10:51] tuhoojabotti: also works 100% with js off
[10:51] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: Well, it does
[10:51] tuhoojabotti: http://dev.tuhoojabotti.com/index/#hello-world ;)
[10:51] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: I'm building it on NodeJS with RESTify for the API, jQuery-based frontend, and ExpressJS for static pages
[10:51] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: Contemplate storing data as RDF
[10:51] jonasen has joined the channel
[10:51] AAA_awright: It sounds really well suited for that application
[10:52] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: What's RDF?
[10:52] AAA_awright: If you have lots of relationships to make
[10:52] tuhoojabotti: Rich Data Format!
[10:52] AAA_awright: Ha no
[10:52] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: Data storage is gonna be in MongodDB
[10:52] tuhoojabotti: it's like RTF right?
[10:52] tuhoojabotti: :P
[10:52] AAA_awright: Resource Description Framework
[10:52] tuhoojabotti: Ok.
[10:52] AAA_awright: It's a data model that makes statements about resources
[10:52] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: Can you toss me an example?
[10:52] AAA_awright: So I can say, http://example.com/art licensed-under public-domain
[10:53] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: And how does this interact with HTML?
[10:53] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: So RDF is the data model, and RDFa is one way of embedding RDF data inside HTML
[10:53] NuckingFuts: ah cool
[10:53] NuckingFuts: Yeah, I'll look into that
[10:53] AAA_awright: See http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/ and
[10:53] bkozal has joined the channel
[10:53] AAA_awright: And this http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/
[10:54] aurynn has left the channel
[10:54] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: Actually, start with http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/ that's more relevant to you
[10:54] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: Perhaps is there some way to do a meta-tag for it?
[10:54] jamey-uk: What do I have put on line 157 to get saveToDatabase() to actually run? I've just started using prototypes and am trying to get my head around closures, scope etc: http://pastebin.com/usAdKR9A
[10:54] AAA_awright: If I understand, that's what RDFa is
[10:54] tuhoojabotti: yeah
[10:55] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: I was worried you might've meant it was a data storage mechanism.  So I can pull from MongoDB and convert into RDFa?
[10:55] tuhoojabotti: didn't html5 introduce some micro-data format?
[10:55] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: Yep
[10:55] NuckingFuts: tuhoojabotti: I'm thinking I'm gonna provide it in every format possible
[10:55] AAA_awright: Microformats are inferior to RDFa, RDFa allows for a wider variety of statements
[10:55] AAA_awright: Microformats is pretty much limited to common things like addresses and telephone numbers and whatnot
[10:55] NuckingFuts: Is there some way to use OAuth and REST?
[10:56] AAA_awright: But they both can be extracted into RDF
[10:56] tuhoojabotti: yeah
[10:56] AAA_awright: For Node.js? Of course
[10:56] NuckingFuts: I'm building on Restify
[10:56] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: Have you started on this project at all?
[10:56] andrewfff has joined the channel
[10:56] tuhoojabotti: AAA_awright: Didn't microdata allowed to add custom data too?
[10:56] AAA_awright: tuhoojabotti: Maybe it does but I'm not familiar... I just know within the semantic web community, RDFa is king
[10:56] tuhoojabotti: :P
[10:57] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: I've got two other people on this project with me, and they're doing the client design and HTML which I then get to tie in with an API (which I also make)
[10:57] NuckingFuts: We've got mockups
[10:57] NuckingFuts: And we've got research and figured out our data structures for what the API will spit out for most apges
[10:57] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: I would encourage you to look at my CMS project that constructs webpages about RDF resources, http://magnode.org/
[10:57] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: Replacing DA is something I've been interested in too
[10:58] dgathright has joined the channel
[10:58] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: RDF will probably end up coming in my first update

[10:58] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: Yeah this isn't going to do all that within 2 months, but I'll follow you
[10:59] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: Do you have a mailing list or something?

[10:59] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: Here subscribe to http://groups.google.com/group/magnode to know when I make a stable release
[10:59] NuckingFuts: We've got a host lined up :P
[10:59] NuckingFuts: Call me crazy, but I think it might be possible.  I once programmed a whole site in a day.
[10:59] NuckingFuts: And I had never touched Wordpress before.
[10:59] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: Also, think people can spell that name?
[11:00] NuckingFuts: And I hadn't touched PHP in years
[11:00] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: I like to think it's about as good as deviantart :P
[11:00] AAA_awright: Me too, but that doesn't mean there's still room for improvement
[11:00] NuckingFuts: We haven't completely settled on it, it's sorta just a project name with its roots in "Fuck you, dA"
[11:00] NuckingFuts: ;)

[11:02] NuckingFuts: They've been ignoring the dev community for a while
[11:02] kohai: @rem: @codepo8 aye, as was #jquery, and is today #nodejs and many, many others. IRC is good, and having web access: even better.
[11:02] NuckingFuts: And we recently found out that it's a disconnect between deviantTech and the middle management
[11:02] NuckingFuts: So programmers aren't happy with their managers

[11:03] AAA_awright: NuckingFuts: And what's with their servers too? Something like 1/15 pages fails to load
[11:03] AAA_awright: And it's seemingly random too
[11:03] NuckingFuts: AAA_awright: inorite.  I hope NodeJS can solve that :D

[11:09] AAA_awright: tuhoojabotti: I'm writing a Node.js IRC client that stays connected in the background, and uses a web browser as a UI
[11:09] NuckingFuts: indutny: I've got a better url.  peterlejeck.tk :D
[11:09] AAA_awright: For now
[11:10] NuckingFuts: Yay for free domains
[11:10] tuhoojabotti: I has tuhoojabotti.com :D

[11:10] AAA_awright: But now I just want to get socket.io working >:( actually maybe it's my backend...

[11:11] indutny: mendel_: of course, can you donate 10-20 $ so I'll be able to run server for at least 1 -2 months
[11:11] AAA_awright: `3rdEden: And it's my problem I'm sure
[11:11] NuckingFuts: But nope, .ck only registeres under .co.ck
[11:11] NuckingFuts: le sigh
[11:11] `3rdEden: AAA_awright cutting edge will probably cutting your wrists as well :D
[11:11] AAA_awright: I have seperate processes for the web browser and the IRC client

[11:25] AAA_awright: `3rdEden: Yeah appearently it's Socket.io on the browser side which is send()ing the very messages sent to it
[11:26] AAA_awright: It send()s back the message for some reason
[11:26] AAA_awright: Which is wildly confusing to my server

[11:29] AAA_awright: <Buffer 00 00>
[11:30] crayzee: AAA_awright, I thought so too
[11:30] AAA_awright: Buffer() appears to consume the trailing \0
[11:30] crayzee: AAA_awright, particularly interesting it's only the terminating \0 that is ignored

[11:32] roidrage: jamey-uk: because you called the method savetoDatabase in line 174
[11:32] crayzee: You're missing a captial T

[11:35] bnoordhuis: Shinuza: no, node is single-threaded - but you can defer callbacks
[11:35] AAA_awright: bnoordhuis: See crayzee's plea and run Buffer("\0") in the REPL

[13:10] level09: i see many modules, trying to find the best one
[13:10] shinuza: I'm not geek enough to use this
[13:10] shinuza: I'm trying hard tho
[13:10] shinuza: level09: read the api, read the code (optionnal)
[13:10] shinuza: enjoy
[13:10] tuhoojabotti: shinuza: What's so geek about it?
[13:10] level09: shinuza: you mean I dont need an extra module ?
[13:11] razvandme: how can i get the host name of a http server in node?!

[13:14] shinuza: oh
[13:15] eldar: hi! I'm trying to understand a bit more on concurrency in node. Given this piece of code http://pastebin.com/5ecUVDY7 my question is: Is it always guaranteed that first callback will be executed before the second one?
[13:15] mauritslamers_ has joined the channel
[13:15] shinuza: eldar: no
[13:15] Ezku\: eldar: of course not
[13:15] mauritslamers_: Question: I am trying to find a memory leak in my node app, but when using the profiler I don't see my own objects anywhere
[13:16] shinuza: It depends on how much time each I/O request would take
[13:16] mbrevoort has joined the channel
[13:16] mauritslamers_: anyone an idea?
[13:16] shinuza: if callback2 opens a 10kb file, and callback1 a 10tb file, obviously...
[13:16] eldar: shinuza, Ezku\  thanks, so there are no synchronisation built into that
[13:16] shinuza: eldar: no, but you can create a "continuation"

[13:17] brianseeders has joined the channel
[13:18] shinuza: basically you say, I'll open these two files, and when they both return values I want to do this other thing
[13:18] mauritslamers_: the profiler info contains lots of (closure) stuff, which seems to be a self-referencing thing
[13:18] shinuza: mauritslamers_: what kind of app
[13:18] thomblake has joined the channel
[13:18] shinuza: do you have C++ node modules?
[13:18] mauritslamers_: server app
[13:19] mauritslamers_: shinuza: no

[13:19] saimon__ has joined the channel
[13:19] shinuza: your javascript is not supposed to leak
[13:19] tim_smart: tuhoojabotti: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/396394/screenshots/irssi.png
[13:19] mauritslamers_: I would expect so.... but still my server app ran out of memory after a week...
[13:20] shinuza: tim_smart: awesome :)
[13:20] shinuza: have you tried xmonad :->
[13:20] mauritslamers_: so now I am trying to find where I might have missed cleaning up properly... but the profiler doesn't help me a bit... 
[13:20] shinuza: mauritslamers_: what is the stack
[13:20] shinuza: what modules are you depending on?

[13:21] mauritslamers_: shinuza: http://github.com/mauritslamers/Thoth -> only depending on node-mysql atm
[13:21] shinuza: Lua is weird tho, a lot less than Haskell too
[13:21] tuhoojabotti: tim_smart: eww, that's just a sacrilege
[13:22] tuhoojabotti: The default theme should never be touched!

[13:23] tim_smart: davidbanham: Yeah
[13:23] shinuza: eldar: try to see if there are some modules to do that
[13:24] shinuza: mauritslamers_: I'd run a lot of queries in a controlled environment, I'm pretty sure node-mysql is the culprit
[13:24] asobrasil has joined the channel
[13:24] shinuza: also, level09 don't chose node-mysql ahah
[13:24] eldar: shinuza, yeah, I'll have a look, thanks

[13:24] level09: shinuza: what do you mean ?

[13:25] mauritslamers_: shinuza: thanks for the hint :)

[13:27] shinuza: mauritslamers_: that's my assumption, but I didn't see node leaking in a ~month of intensive usage (at least the latest version)
[13:27] shinuza: so I'd say node-mysql is leaking

[13:44] Clex: Know a bunch of stuff about "crazy frenchies".
[13:44] shinuza: You see, Mozilla made it very clear that they will devert from ECMA 262 and thus released different versions of their API with extended features
[13:45] shinuza: which should later be implemented in ECMA 5/Harmony
[13:45] shinuza: but Google never did that

[15:02] Corren: how/if are you guys monitoring node with munin?
[15:02] `3rdEden: they have a _onDisconnect

[15:02] `3rdEden: saschagehlich some people are already toying with 0.7
[15:02] `3rdEden: saschagehlich not really
[15:02] saschagehlich: `3rdEden: maybe just close the client socket?
[15:02] `3rdEden: saschagehlich: you should send a kill message to the client and have the client kill it
[15:02] saschagehlich: `3rdEden: alright
[15:02] `3rdEden: saschagehlich polling transports ftw
[15:02] `3rdEden: ;D
[15:02] `3rdEden: + auto reconnect
[15:03] `3rdEden: so that wouldn't help that much

[18:53] mkultra329 has joined the channel
[18:53] mraleph: non independent handles die only on major (full) collections

[18:53] BigWookie has left the channel

[18:54] mraleph: independent handles can't participate in Object Groups
[18:54] iammerrick has joined the channel
[18:54] mraleph: but node does not use object groups API 
[18:54] piscisaureus: ... which is a feature that I've never heard of ...

[18:55] mraleph: this is for the best that you've not heard about this evil API

[18:56] piscisaureus: mraleph: for ObjectWrap we are not using that api at all any more. We kill them explicitly.

[18:57] Skipants has joined the channel
[18:58] bradleymeck__: isaacs you about?
[18:58] piscisaureus: mraleph: is it possible to have a really efficient callback type (e.g. it does make gc to run twice etc) at the expense of not allowing heap access from the callback?
[18:58] piscisaureus: I mean, just call the callback whenever the heap slot gets freed or something like that?
[18:59] dmcquay_ has joined the channel
[18:59] mraleph: you mean weak callback?
[18:59] mraleph: yes
[18:59] mraleph: but that would require API rework.

[19:00] 64MAAPMB2 has joined the channel
[19:00] adambeynon has joined the channel
[19:00] mraleph: well basically someone needs to introduce a weak callback that can't touch V8 at all.
[19:00] mraleph: it's not a rework but rather an extension.
[19:01] piscisaureus: mraleph: well you can't really prevent the user from touching v8. You just need to specify that it is not allowed.
[19:01] mraleph: yep that's what I meant

[19:02] piscisaureus: If I wanted to do that, where would I start?
[19:04] piscisaureus: Hooking into the code where heap slots are juggled seems to be rather invasive

[19:05] gkmngrgn has joined the channel
[19:05] mraleph: it's pretty hairy
[19:05] piscisaureus: mraleph: I thought about having a separate list of "sparse" handles that do count as a gc root
[19:05] piscisaureus: after the mark phace we iterate over all the sparse handles and check whether they reference an unmarked object
[19:05] sinke has joined the channel
[19:06] mraleph: yep
[19:06] piscisaureus: if that's the case, dispose and call the callback

[19:06] bibabot: AAA_awright: great .. anywhere i can see it?
[19:06] piscisaureus: mraleph: well

[19:08] tbranyen: sinke: i hate that word
[19:08] sinke: question is about node, not about os
[19:08] piscisaureus: mraleph: these hooks are all after the GC is completely done. So adding this fast-weak logic there would be no good, I want to have these callbacks made halfway in the gc, so we don't require two rounds
[19:08] tbranyen: well see... thats where you're wrong
[19:09] tbranyen: sinke: i dunno try out the latest node build that has libuv
[19:09] mraleph: piscisaureus: I understand that
[19:09] Skola: he's not on win08 voluntarily I'm guessing
[19:09] tbranyen: Skola: well yeah, but i'm assuming node would be used volunatarily
[19:09] Murvin: monokrome: what is "forever"?  do u have the website that I can take a look?
[19:09] tbranyen: since nobody would demand to run node on windows
[19:09] sinke: i have to figure out how to do it on win08.. thats all :)
[19:09] tbranyen: i'd hope
[19:09] sinke: node works just fine on windows
[19:10] tbranyen: "just fine"
[19:10] tbranyen: it worked like shit last time i tried it in cygwin

[19:10] Skola: jaja I'm messing around :p
[19:10] sinke: i dont try it in cygwin.. is installed as win service
[19:10] mraleph: piscisaureus: basically what you want to do is to IdentifyWeakHandles and call callbacks immediately without doing additional round of processing to preserve weakly reachable objects

[19:14] darshanshankar has joined the channel
[19:14] Murvin: I use jqtpl
[19:14] jhurliman: eazyigz, my vote is with jade
[19:14] gf3: Jade
[19:14] Murvin: eazyigz: I use jqtpl
[19:14] coreb has joined the channel

[19:15] eazyigz: Murvin: jqtpl doesn't have great documentation and examples
[19:15] eazyigz: jade does look very straightforward for a one-page thing I am building...
[19:16] piscisaureus: mraleph: what do you mean by "corrupted headers" -- what is corrupted exactly?
[19:16] Skola: Jade rox0rs jawohl
[19:16] slaskis: eazyigz: this one: https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs not the clunky embeddedjs.com one
[19:16] bloodsucker_ has joined the channel
[19:16] Skola: for a one page-something I'd def. go with jade
[19:16] Murvin: eazyigz: I agree. but the syntax is simplier than Jade.     i feel...

[19:17] Skola has joined the channel
[19:17] Murvin: so, anyone know how to limit the % of CPU node can use?
[19:17] bloodsucker_: Murvin, 100%??
[19:18] bbrn has joined the channel
[19:18] JoseCabo: Murvin, 100% should could use.
[19:18] slaskis: Murvin: like http://cpulimit.sourceforge.net/ ?
[19:18] Lagnus has joined the channel
[19:18] JoseCabo: Murvin, ah, sorry, slaskis 
[19:18] JoseCabo: Murvin, you should use cpulimit, yes.
[19:18] gozala has joined the channel
[19:19] Murvin: bloodsucker_: well.  for massive requests, it will go up to 95% or something like that. I want to limit it to only take upto 80%.  I don't mind the request processing time being a bit slow.  
[19:19] jbergstroem: Murvin: use renice ?
[19:19] Murvin: JoseCabo:  cpulimit?
[19:19] Murvin: let me take a look now
[19:19] mraleph: piscisaureus: well. the first words of the objects is a tagged pointer to a Map (aka hidden class) during normal execution
[19:19] mraleph: piscisaureus: but during marksweep gc we remove tag to indicate marked object
[19:19] JoseCabo: yes, Murvin cpulimut, you can adjust how many % of cpu could use a process.
[19:20] JoseCabo: sudo apt-get install cpulimit :P
[19:20] mraleph: piscisaureus: so everything goes BADABOOM if you use getters/setters that rely on properly tagged map pointer
[19:20] JoseCabo: and then man cpulimit or directly cpulimit without args for help.

[19:23] Murvin: jbergstroem: I onlly run node.js on my server. However, my manager will freak out if I show him that node will take 95% CPU.  although I know there is no problem at all. lol
[19:24] piscisaureus: mraleph: the discussions we had on sunday night made me realized how fucked up it is that not a single note contributor understands what's going on in the VM.
[19:24] piscisaureus: mraleph: so I'm going to spend time with it and make sure I get to know.
[19:24] Murvin: jberstroem: in fact, for production, if my program goes over 90% cpu, everyone will get email alert. lol  i don't want this happen. :)  but thanks for the advice ^^
[19:25] mraleph: piscisaureus: :-)
[19:25] jbergstroem: Murvin: 95% cpu for how long? a "ls -al" can just as well grab those 100% if conditions are met
[19:25] mraleph: piscisaureus: don't hesitate to ask :-)
[19:25] mendel_: Murvin: what are you using for that notification? monit?

[19:39] tjholowaychuk: not something im interested in
[19:39] idefine: c4milo: yes, while that that will prevent the app from crashing i'm no longer in the context of the request that just came in..so I wouldn't be able to send some kind of failed response to the server would I? Also, there isn't must detail about the error at that point is there?

[19:55] idefine: c4milo: well, all i want is to make sure my entire app doesn't fail, just because one request went wrong, currently i'm using mongoose, and if the conneciton to my db is lost, the entire app dies

[20:15] isaacs: dans: npm install -g for cli scripts
[20:16] mendel_: dans: npm install expresso -g
[20:16] c4milo: xerox: basically, a) calling the super constructor (EventEmitter.call(this)) and b) copying over EventEmitter properties into your object (util.inherits.blabla) 
[20:16] dans: thanks
[20:16] dans: why does it not say that in the docs then?
[20:16] mendel_: older npm
[20:16] xerox: c4milo: why does the code I was looking at do it at the end of the constructor function definition?
[20:17] isaacs: dans: npm 0.x was global-by-default
[20:17] dans: ah ok
[20:17] c4milo: xerox: what code?

[20:35] jscheel: hey guys, I'm having an issue with my express install on my production server. So, on my dev env, everything is fine, but as soon as I push to production, only the first level of static files are served. If any static file is in a subdir, it doesn't get treated as static

[20:36] c4milo: idefine: no that I know, what version of mongoose are you using? 
[20:36] idefine: c4milo: 1.4.0, but this would have to be done in the native mongodb drivers
[20:37] c4milo: idefine: strange, i am using that version and I don't have that issue 
[20:37] c4milo: idefine: do you have the link pointing to the issue? 
[20:37] idefine: c4milo: you can survive a lost connection without process.on 'uncaughtexception' ?

[20:47] Keni: any suggestions on econnrefused at dns.js:74:15?
[20:47] quackquack: yeah

[20:48] idefine: c4milo: ok, we are on the same page :), would it make sense for it to throw an error that you can catch? 'notConnected' ?

[20:49] c4milo: idefine: I'm not sure, I would have to look at this issue carefully 
[20:49] Keni: npm-debug.log worked fine up to dns.js
[20:50] c4milo: idefine: since mongoose is the layer on top of the driver it would be possible as well that mongoose handles the reconnections
[20:50] c4milo: idefine: I mean, it makes sense 
[20:50] idefine: c4milo: hmm, it seems like the latest native mongodb driver actually pushes this error to the callback properly
[20:51] Keni: Oh. Wrong. was merely analyzing. verbose url resolving [ 'http://registry.npmjs.org/', './vogue' ]
[20:51] idefine: c4milo: so it can be caught :)
[20:51] Keni: I've tried putting nameserver in resolve.config. What else to do?
[20:52] blup has joined the channel
[20:53] Keni: I've also put an exception in windows firewall for node, but can't figure out how to do that for npm
[20:53] c4milo: idefine: wait, the driver comes with mongoose, are you using a different version that the one that comes by default in mongoose? 
[20:53] philippkueng has joined the channel
[20:53] idefine: c4milo: i think the one that ships with mongoose might be a little outdated, but checking that now
[20:54] jscheel: tjholowaychuk: huh, weird... apparently monit wasn't restarting processes, even thought it was saying that it was, so node was never restarting
[20:54] jscheel: tjholowaychuk: problem fixed
[20:54] tjholowaychuk: ah
[20:55] jscheel: tjholowaychuk: monit is the biggest load of crap, ugh

[21:03] tiglionabbit: hi.  I'm working on a simple node app and I need to use a database.  I looked at node-postgres and FastLegS -- I like the features in FastLegS that convert a dict into values to be inserted or updated, but I'm not sure how to do any complex queries with it, like a many-to-many
[21:04] OhMeadhbh has joined the channel
[21:04] adambeynon has left the channel
[21:04] tiglionabbit: also looked briefly at redis -- is there any convenient way to store a dict of data in redis?  Do you have to expand it into individual fields?
[21:05] spaceinv1der: or encode into json
[21:05] perezd has joined the channel
[21:05] tiglionabbit: oh yeah I guess I could do that

[21:05] S1kx: i have an express server that accesses my mongodb with the node-mongodb package, there are about 200-300 requests per second that all need to check for records in the database. would it make sense to expose a db object to the entire process or should i keep reopening connections on each request?
[21:06] tiglionabbit: I'm using backbone.js.  It'd be pretty bad-ass to use it on the server-side too and have the urls coincide with redis records.  Can you have slashes in redis keys?
[21:06] OhMeadhbh: @S1kx... in theory, a single db object could be used since node is single threaded.
[21:07] OhMeadhbh: s/could be used/is probably okay/
[21:07] tiglionabbit: depends what mongo is densigned for, and I think that is the way it's supposed to work yes
[21:08] tiglionabbit: do you guys actually find it more convenient to use redis and maintain many lists instead of using sql and making join tables?
[21:08] S1kx: OhMeadhbh: yep I was just wondering if the driver can properly handle a queue of queries, since I've had problems before with async postgres drivers since i had to wait until one command on the connection is completed before issueing another
[21:09] OhMeadhbh: hey nodesters.. anyone here using node-inspector? i really, really, really want to love it, but it seems to have a problem with node apps started with --debug-brk. anyone else run into this? (or better yet, find a solution?)
[21:09] tiglionabbit: anyone here use FastLegS?
[21:10] bronson has joined the channel
[21:11] erictj: @OhMeadhbh  I use node-inspector with —debug-brk, seems to work okay
[21:11] OhMeadhbh: @S1kx - i would think it would, though i haven't looked too closely at it. i'm using the native driver (node-mongodb-native???) and there are definitely some limitations in terms of throughput, but so far it hasn't been that big of a deal for me.
[21:11] xerox: tjholowaychuk: is the chapter Inheriting from EventEmitter from your book relevant to today's node.js?
[21:11] tjholowaychuk: xerox cant remember
[21:11] OhMeadhbh: erictj - hmm. yeah. i was afraid of that.
[21:11] erictj: @Ohmeadhbh what's your specific problem?
[21:12] OhMeadhbh: fwiw... what my instance of node-inspector does is
[21:12] xerox: tjholowaychuk: it does exactly what you do in log.js let me find a link I am reading the epub version

[21:12] riven has joined the channel
[21:12] S1kx: OhMeadhbh: what kind of limitations have you run into?
[21:12] tjholowaychuk: xerox does what
[21:12] philippkueng has joined the channel
[21:12] OhMeadhbh: it works fine, but only lets you see the standard node libraries and the single file you started with
[21:12] xerox: tjholowaychuk: http://visionmedia.github.com/masteringnode/book.html
[21:12] OhMeadhbh: so if you do node --debug-brk app.js
[21:12] erictj: ahh, right.
[21:12] jj0hns0n has joined the channel
[21:12] OhMeadhbh: and app.js imports a bunch of modules, you can't see them until you step into them
[21:12] erictj: you need to find the calls to your specific library, break on those, then step into them
[21:13] erictj: right
[21:13] xerox: tjholowaychuk: those four lines of code in that paragraph (Inherithing From EventEmitter)
[21:13] OhMeadhbh: which basically means i can't use it to debug some of my constructors (*sad face*)
[21:13] xerox: well, 5
[21:13] tjholowaychuk: xerox: EventEmitter.call(this);?
[21:13] erictj: even when you step into their instantation lines?
[21:13] OhMeadhbh: @erictj - yeah. that's not going to work for my app
[21:13] xerox: tjholowaychuk: no
[21:13] erictj: suck
[21:14] erictj: yeah, that's an annoyance of mine as well for sure
[21:14] xerox: oh that line is not in the epub version
[21:14] xerox: so yes
[21:14] tjholowaychuk: xerox just tell me the code
[21:14] tjholowaychuk: lol
[21:14] tjholowaychuk: EventEmitter.call(this); is not needed anymore
[21:14] tjholowaychuk: though it should be IMO
[21:15] tjholowaychuk: the methods just do a check for ._events
[21:15] tjholowaychuk: or populate it to {}
[21:15] tjholowaychuk: each call
[21:15] OhMeadhbh: so.. blargh. i think i'm going to soon find myself digging into the v8 debugger code and/or node-inspector.
[21:15] xerox: the epub version is var EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter; function Dog(name) { this.name = name; } together with Dog.prototype.__proto__ = EventEmitter.prototype;
[21:15] OhMeadhbh: which is not how i wanted to spend my week
[21:15] xerox: the html version has got the EventEmitter.call(this); call right after the this.name = name 
[21:15] tjholowaychuk: xerox: k?
[21:15] tjholowaychuk: nope you dont need that anymore
[21:15] huhlig has joined the channel
[21:15] tjholowaychuk: people were not inheriting correctly i guess

[21:17] huhlig: can anyone tell me why I am getting this error? http://pastebin.com/TQ2tZZCR from this code http://pastebin.com/3YD1aqVn
[21:17] tjholowaychuk: xerox EventEmitter.call(this); would be "correct"
[21:17] tjholowaychuk: but doesn't do anything anymore
[21:17] tmm1: is there a way to install npm to a specific prefix.. something like node cli.js install -g --prefix /opt
[21:18] xerox: tjholowaychuk: I guess I'll keep it there then
[21:18] tjholowaychuk: xerox nah nah
[21:18] tjholowaychuk: you dont need it, but i think node does it in a weird way
[21:18] tjholowaychuk: but i guess if it's easier for people then it's fine
[21:19] xerox: I have been unable to find where it says how to inherit properly from EE or whatever
[21:19] tjholowaychuk: just like how you would with anything else
[21:19] tjholowaychuk: typically you call the constructor function in context of "this"
[21:19] tjholowaychuk: to set up state
[21:19] tjholowaychuk: but that's not the case for EventEmitter because it handles that stuff on each method call
[21:20] huhlig: anyone?
[21:20] xerox: ok
[21:20] xerox: another thing is that some people get their EventEmitter object from require('event').EventEmitter, others from process.EventEmitter
[21:20] xerox: is there any difference?

[21:25] arpegius has joined the channel

[21:27] llrcombs: hey, check this out: http://search.npmjs.org/#/nttpd
[21:27] llrcombs: it runs like apache, but it works with NJS files
[21:27] llrcombs: USEFUL!

[21:30] chad_burt: question - seems like most libraries I've seen using node don't worry about private/privileged vars on objects, just assigning everything to `this`. Is that becoming a best practice as opposed to protecting with closures?

[21:31] dmcquay_ has joined the channel

[21:33] miccolis: chrisdickinson: for what it's worth we (developmentseed) are actively support ours
[21:33] bnoordhuis: huhlig: probably by hooking uncaughtException and pretending your nose bleeds
[21:33] SubStack: kmiyashiro: because they live at the top-level scope and you can't nest them closed over variables

[21:35] bnoordhuis: huhlig: it's a global exception catcher
[21:36] chrisdickinson: chad_burt: from what i've seen (and maybe from unabashed hope a bit), i'd say that python and javascript both subscribe to the "we're all adults here" idiom as regards private/protected variables
[21:36] Poetro has joined the channel
[21:36] chrisdickinson: it's possible to create private and protected variables, but i've rarely seen that it helps an api, personally.
[21:37] chad_burt: the difference I'm seeing is that in python there is a convention (supported by the tooling) for marking methods/attributes as not part of the public api
[21:37] chad_burt: _protected
[21:37] chrisdickinson: chad_burt: yeah -- i personally try to follow that convention in my javascript, too.
[21:38] chad_burt: I'm more concerned about making my code easy to use as opposed to preventing behavior
[21:38] llrcombs: chrisdickinson: plus, if you want access to a private variable in either language, you can modify the library
[21:39] chrisdickinson: llrcombs: yep. i've had this come up while writing unit tests a lot.
[21:39] SubStack: that is a silly convention
[21:39] llrcombs: chrisdickinson: hey, wanna try a bit of code?
[21:39] chrisdickinson: llrcombs: sure?
[21:39] chad_burt: Substack - better suggestion?
[21:39] llrcombs: http://search.npmjs.org/#/nttpd
[21:39] SubStack: if you start having to have _members just turn your api into a closure-based one instead of prototype
[21:39] llrcombs: I haven't written a readme yet, but I will
[21:39] llrcombs: basically, go to a dir and type nttpd
[21:40] chrisdickinson: SubStack: i don't like private variables. even if they do clean up my object as presented to Object.keys
[21:40] SubStack: why not?
[21:40] RC1140 has joined the channel
[21:40] huhlig: ok so why do all requests except the first time out
[21:40] SubStack: they're not "private" as such
[21:40] SubStack: they're scoped
[21:41] SubStack: and as a bonus, you get a new scope for each function you declare
[21:41] llrcombs: if you want, put https://github.com/11rcombs/nttpd/blob/master/test.njs somewhere in the dir

[21:48] bnoordhuis: JoseCabo: you got it working?
[21:48] JoseCabo: so i did it... with the +- newer version. And... it worked! :D
[21:48] JoseCabo: seems to be a bug with 0.4.8 version
[21:49] bnoordhuis: well, glad you got it resolved
[21:49] JoseCabo: my code worked but not node-ogl code so i will continue "porting" my code to node-ogl orignal code
[21:49] llrcombs: zmbmartin: this.send(data);

[22:12] quackquack: no, no. C#. its like java but without the cross-platform-ness
[22:13] MooGoo: but Java is a proper as a language cna get
[22:13] tactical: so you "createServer()", but what if that code has bugs?

[22:15] frodenius: let's be realistic, if you cannot understand other peoples' code, why the heck are you writing a web server anyway
[22:15] jscheel: tactical: gonna take you for your word. You catch any exceptions that may be thrown. If all else fails and your server crashes, you should be monitoring it with something like monit, which will notice that it is down and restart the service

[22:27] AvianFlu: MooGoo: s/in/on/ , don't front :D
[22:27] jscheel: xerox: throw err just says "there's been a problem". If that throw doesn't bubble up to a try catch statement somewhere, then process.on('UncaughtException'... will catch it.

[22:47] metadaddy has joined the channel
[22:47] tjholowaychuk: form, sessions, etc
[22:47] zmbmartin: tjholowaychuk: is there a callback that I can use for when the req.form is finished?
[22:47] NuckingFuts: tjholowaychuk: Aye, how do I handle sessions though?
[22:47] tjholowaychuk: zmbmartin it's all in the docs/tests/source
[22:47] NuckingFuts: As in cookie-session shit
[22:47] tjholowaychuk: with the session middleware
[22:47] NuckingFuts: ACTION has the urge to eat cookies >_>
[22:47] tjholowaychuk: look at the auth example
[22:48] NuckingFuts: tjholowaychuk: Can I drop in my own auth system?
[22:48] xerox: jscheel: what do you mean? I think that if you add a setInterval the process would not finish since now you are catching anything
[22:48] tjholowaychuk: NuckingFuts of course
[22:48] fakewaffle: is there an app that can extract my documentation for api?

[22:51] davidbanham: NuckingFuts: It's easier than you may think. Here's a code dump from my current app showing the guts of the login, logout, authentication, user creation and password change system.
[22:51] davidbanham: http://pastebin.com/JLUenV2r
[22:51] NuckingFuts: I'm using MongoDB for my database shit, should I use Mongo or add Redis to handle session stores?
[22:52] addisonj: fakewaffle, you take a look at this? https://github.com/visionmedia/dox
[22:52] davidbanham: NuckingFuts: That's a question I can't really answer. Don't know enough about Mongo. Redis is awesome and simple as hell, though.
[22:52] NuckingFuts: davidbanham: MongoDB is a great store system for long-term storage
[22:52] addisonj: NuckingFuts, mongo works jsut fine too
[22:53] addisonj: and you aren't going to loose much on performance honestly
[22:53] addisonj: if anything at all
[22:53] carpeliam: hey, is anybody using juggernaut? i was wondering if i can run juggernaut as part of my existing node app, do i really need to run juggernaut in a separate node instance?
[22:53] NuckingFuts: Things like user passwords and shit are great in it
[22:53] fakewaffle: addisonj: thanks man
[22:53] NuckingFuts: addisonj: Okay, that was my biggest fear.
[22:53] NuckingFuts: Thanks for that :D
[22:53] addisonj: NuckingFuts, for sessions stores, connect-mongodb
[22:53] davidbanham: NuckingFuts: Yeah I could identify it at 100m, but I don't know the ins and outs of it. Using Mongo for everything will probably make it simpler when you want to scale horizontally.
[22:53] addisonj: is the package you will want
[22:53] metadaddy has joined the channel
[22:54] tahu has joined the channel
[22:54] NuckingFuts: addisonj: I assume that's a middleware session store system built on mongo?
[22:54] addisonj: yep
[22:54] davidbanham: Incidentally, if anyone wants to take a look at that code I posted and tell me if I've done anything monumentally stupid with my crypto I'd appreciate it. http://pastebin.com/JLUenV2r
[22:55] NuckingFuts: I do SHA-256 hashes for my password stores
[22:55] NuckingFuts: Salted by the username
[22:55] brownies has joined the channel
[22:55] NuckingFuts: Thinking of adding another salt though too >_>
[22:55] addisonj: salts probably shouldn't be by username... use something semi random
[22:55] NuckingFuts: addisonj: Per-user or global?
[22:56] Sorella has joined the channel
[22:56] addisonj: NuckingFuts, here is a good technique, look at the way he does his user class, and it uses mongoose
[22:56] addisonj: https://github.com/alexyoung/nodepad/blob/master/models.js
[22:56] NuckingFuts: ewwwwwww mongoose
[22:57] NuckingFuts: ACTION vomits all over addisonj's shoes
[22:57] temp01 has joined the channel
[22:57] addisonj: well, however, you can take that technique and apply it elsewhere
[22:57] NuckingFuts: mongo-native :D
[22:57] addisonj: mongoose is nice... but API changes are sort of bugging me

[22:59] NuckingFuts: addisonj: To me, it's too clunky, and not many people seem to actually have used it.  The part that originally scared me about Mongo-native was the nested callbacks, but once I finally grasped scope back in Feburary, it wasn't nearly as bad.
