[05:00] meso_ has joined the channel
[05:01] vptr: given the c10k premise of node i figured ye olde garbage collection would be a problem for it
[05:01] vptr: i.e. since it handles high load most frameworks tend to experience problems when the garbage collector runs out of idle time and just blocks the app in order to clean
[05:02] NuckingFuts: vptr: As I understand, the load isn't actually that heavy in msot cases.
[05:03] NuckingFuts: NodeJS threads I/O, but beyond that is primarily single-threaded.
[05:03] NuckingFuts: So the main process is designed to run fast and then stya idle.
[05:04] yozgrahame has joined the channel
[05:04] NuckingFuts: And since it's based on v8, I'd assume when it "runs fast", it does so with style.

[05:04] NuckingFuts: :P
[05:05] chrisdickinson: NuckingFuts: one thing to note is that it's also relying on library authors to do whatever they have to do as fast as they can, and barring that, splitting the work up into iterations that release back to the event loop when possible

[06:56] dtan_: hey guys, i got a question about reading in a directory with files in it
[06:56] grandy: i thought they were too... so you're saying it's either that jade is enforcing the spec or that it's a bug?
[06:56] Skola: yes grandy
[06:56] Skola: I'll try to find what the spec says
[06:57] grandy: Skola: wow ok
[06:57] cachemoney: grandy: is this html5
[06:57] grandy: cachemoney: yes
[06:57] Skola: the thing is: lists are block elements

[06:57] NuckingFuts|mobi has joined the channel
[06:57] dtan_: i've been able to get the list with require('fs')  and going through the directory, but i can only get the list to show up when my "findFiles" method is within whichever file I am running my site on
[06:57] TomY has joined the channel
[06:58] grandy: Skola: strange, i would still think it could go inside p
[06:58] saurabhverma has joined the channel

[06:58] dtan_: if i try to offload the "findFiles" functionality into a separate file and do a require('./lib/findFiles')
[06:58] dtan_: i don't get the list showing up after that
[06:58] Skola: but remember, browsers let you get away with a lot of bullshit html
[06:58] NuckingFuts|mobi: Ugh I need to go get "nuck" deregistered :P

[07:00] grandy: that's wild
[07:00] Skola: semantically it's not correct to put a list inside a paragraph, depending how you look at it
[07:00] cachemoney: end the paragraph, put the list, then start another paragraph
[07:00] grandy: Skola: yeah at first i thought it wasn't correct then i thought that i might write: today i'll go to the store, the restaurant and the club
[07:00] NuckingFuts|mobi: I could be sending a picture with text/html, and it'd try to parse it as tag soup lol
[07:01] grandy: one could feasibly mark that up in a list and color each destination differently or something
[07:01] isaqual has joined the channel

[07:02] NuckingFuts|mobi: Fuck <p>, use <span> or <div> :P

[07:03] Skola: I'm not even being ironic

[07:05] NuckingFuts|mobi: Freudian slip ;)
[07:05] grandy: Skola: i keep being tempted to use section everywhere
[07:05] grandy: it's the new div

[07:32] Skola: grandy I agree though that it starts to look ugly real fast

[07:33] isaacs: aww, thanks
[07:33] isaacs: srsly, though, in oakland you really don't have to worry about any serious violence, unless you talk shit to a bart cop.

[07:40] isaacs: NuckingFuts: there's flesh eating bacteria in the bart seats.  (not exaggerating)
[07:40] NuckingFuts: The frist time they rode a bus, a man was fondling his nutsack on the bus.  The other time, my friend Brittnie was on the bus, and suddenly the man next to her whipped it out
[07:40] NuckingFuts: isaacs: lolwat?
[07:40] Skola: lol
[07:40] isaacs: SubStack: yeah, the original pitch was that it had "as many seats as a 747" or some shit

[07:42] isaacs: my only other complaint about hte bart, besides the humans and their flesh eating bacterias, is that they hate bikes at rush hour.

[07:43] SubStack: yeah I wish bart had dedicated bike racks like MAX

[12:32] swistak: kollapse, depending on usage
[12:32] kollapse: swistak: Well I'm trying to code a website in node.js (been hearing good thing about it) as opposed to PHP.
[12:32] swistak: either use guide for nginx + mongrel (with nginx as upstream proxy) setup is basically the same
[12:33] swistak: what you need nginx for basically?
[12:33] chjj: real men use node.js without nginx
[12:33] chjj: !
[12:34] vpereira: wtf
[12:34] kollapse: swistak: Well static content of course ....
[12:34] kollapse: Images, htmls, CSS, fonts etc.

[12:35] lukegalea: kollapse: I'll post my config.
[12:36] lukegalea: kollapse: there's no one guide that I know of.
[12:36] xerox: chjj: it's easy
[12:36] chjj: easy?
[12:36] xerox: there is an example on node-request I think
[12:36] xerox: read, pump
[12:37] chjj: im talking about sendfile, no reads, no writes, just sendfile
[12:37] Bwen: chjj: how do you send a file if you dont want to read it? O.o
[12:37] lukegalea: kollapse: Are you comfortable setting up cluster to host the node stuff?
[12:37] swistak: kollapse, it's not really obvious - it's much easier to use connect/express middleware
[12:37] lukegalea: If so: let's assume you've got cluster up and running on port 3000
[12:38] ngs has joined the channel
[12:38] chjj: ...sendfile
[12:38] kollapse: lukegalea: Hmm. Well for this particular case I'm just using one single server.
[12:38] lukegalea: how many processors?
[12:38] hellp has joined the channel
[12:38] Sembiance: :)
[12:38] Bwen: chjj: what do you think that method does? it actualy opens the file and send its content ...
[12:38] swistak: kollapse, then don't bother wih nginx
[12:39] kollapse: swistak: I have PHP sites as well... need it to redirect to PHP-fpm
[12:39] chjj: yeah, but theres no userspace reads to my understanding
[12:39] lukegalea: kollapse: ya, I'm only using nginx so it will work as a load balancer.. and while I'm at it I have it do GZIP and server static..
[12:39] swistak: Bwen, chjj: it does this on much lower level, content of file is streamed through DMA straight to the socket
[12:39] chjj: yes, thats what im saying
[12:39] chjj: it does it at the kernel level
[12:39] chjj: its more efficient
[12:39] xerox: o
[12:39] swistak: kollapse, the simply add upstream server on domain, - you can use nginx + mongrel example on nginx website
[12:40] kollapse: Understood, I'll look into it. Thanks
[12:40] duckspeaker has joined the channel
[12:40] chjj: the thing is, if you used sendfile over http, data would get written directly to the sockets file descriptor, and it would bypass all the node sugar, node wouldnt know when to send the headers, it would know to emit a drain event, etc
[12:41] chjj: wouldnt know to end the response, you would have to do it all by hand
[12:41] lukegalea: kollapse: https://gist.github.com/1035547
[12:42] kollapse: Thanks lukegalea.
[12:42] lukegalea: kollapse: but seriously: use cluster even for one server. You want to run as many node instances as you have processors.
[12:42] lukegalea: and cluster will do that for you by default

[14:37] shinuza: should have :p
[14:37] dtan: i just saw it worked for someone else 
[14:37] mid9commander: why is npm such a piece of shit
[14:38] dtan: you say tomato, i say potato =P
[14:38] dtan: i've had good luck with npm
[14:38] mid9commander: it works intermittenly
[14:38] mid9commander: without giving any proper explanation of why 
[14:38] dtan: as i've heard the over the past week or so
[14:38] dtan: but i have yet to experience that *knock on wood*
[14:38] mid9commander: oh boy
[14:39] mid9commander: you should upgrade to the latest and "greatest"
[14:39] mid9commander: on one terminal it works "ok"
[14:39] mid9commander: and then I open another

[14:40] mid9commander: http://pastebin.com/QcsDEYcM
[14:40] mid9commander: sorry about that
[14:41] dtan: hmm ya not sure, and you don't need to sudo when you install npm stuff?
[14:41] mid9commander: and even when it is working, meaning when it installs mongodb native driver properly
[14:41] mid9commander: I did sudo
[14:41] dtan: oh
[14:41] mid9commander: does that cause problem?
[14:41] dtan: which versino of npm?
[14:41] mid9commander: 1.0.13
[14:42] dtan: na should make it work better, depending on how locked down your machine is
[14:42] mid9commander: I probably should downgrade
[14:42] dtan: maybe
[14:42] dtan: i have 1.0.10
[14:42] mid9commander: cool, I will downgrade
[14:42] dtan: is 1.0.13 a pre release?
[14:42] shinuza: mid9commander: you should try `sudo npm config set loglevel info`  if you want more output
[14:42] mid9commander: not really
[14:42] shinuza: dtan:  no
[14:42] mid9commander: it is a stable
[14:42] dtan: ok
[14:42] dtan: might want to report that as a bug then
[14:42] mid9commander: ok, and that is just one of the problem
[14:42] llrcombs: I'm having trouble with child_process.spawn with customFds
[14:43] mid9commander: even when it was working and installs mongodb native driver properly
[14:43] mid9commander: the require('mongodb') doesn't even work
[14:43] llrcombs: I'm trying to redirect stdout to an HTTP ServerResponse
[14:43] mid9commander: so seems to me downgrade is the way to go
[14:43] llrcombs: and stdin to an HTTP ServerRequest
[14:43] dtan: mid9commander: npm install mongodb?
[14:43] llrcombs: I just get stdout to console and stdin from... I dunno where, haven't tested
[14:43] mid9commander: I did
[14:43] dtan: hmmm 
[14:43] mid9commander: yes npm install mongodb
[14:44] mid9commander: and npm ls shows the proper mongodb package installed
[14:44] dtan: you try using a middleware like connect-mongodb?
[14:44] mid9commander: nope
[14:44] mid9commander: I don't think that is necessary
[14:44] dtan: that *might* be better, but i'm not sure
[14:44] bradleymeck__ has joined the channel
[14:44] mid9commander: anyway, I think the latest version of npm is just whacked, seriously, no offense meant
[14:45] dtan: i just started getting into nodejs earlier this month, so my knowledge base is limited but i've used connect-mongodb and it seemed to work ok
[14:45] llrcombs: any suggestions?

[14:49] llrcombs: I'm adding CGI support for the next version, and  it's not done yet
[14:49] dtan: k looking at it
[14:50] llrcombs: but I'm still getting stdout to... stdout, rather than the ServerResponse
[14:50] dtan: and are you getting some sort of error? or just a blank output?
[14:50] llrcombs: I'm getting lines to the console and the request never gets any data or terminates
[14:50] jonaslund: anyone here speaking portugeese ?
[14:50] llrcombs: here, lemme pastebin my test .cgi
[14:50] jonaslund: maybe it's portugese ..?
[14:51] llrcombs: http://pastebin.com/3WYprtNK

[14:53] dtan: gotcha
[14:53] llrcombs: I'm not sure if anything ends up in process at all
[14:53] llrcombs: lemme check
[14:54] dtan: you try the examples int eh docs?

[14:55] dtan: but process is in teh global namespace
[14:55] llrcombs: oh yeah, process gets an object with loads of stuffs
[14:55] llrcombs: oh, yeah
[14:55] dtan: so that could be an issue
[14:55] llrcombs: there might be something to that

[14:56] dtan: ok
[14:56] llrcombs: but nice catch, I don't like polluting global
[14:56] dtan: well, try keeping it as a different name
[14:56] dtan: then try this
[14:56] llrcombs: but I think the var statement kept that from happening
[14:56] llrcombs: .pipe?
[14:56] dtan: var newProcess = spawn(...);
[14:56] dtan: newProcess.stdout.on('data', function (data) {

[14:58] jonaslund: slaskis: the guy is reading a paper named "hora"

[14:58] jonaslund: apperantly means time in portugese
[14:58] dtan: k oops
[14:58] llrcombs: 2. I did something similar, I used .pipe()
[14:58] ts__: does socket.io have a irc channel?
[14:58] slaskis: jonaslund: haha, yeah it does
[14:58] llrcombs: it works!
[14:59] dtan: with which? .pipe()? or what i pointed to?
[14:59] Tidwell: tbranyen: im running into an issue where I'm putting a node process behind netscalar and need to open ports for websocket/flash socket - any way i can figure out what ports it is using?

[15:24] jamey-uk: addisonj: I just tried putting those below bodyParser(), it didn't work, then below the connect-form call, that didn't work either :( would methodOverride() be affecting it? I'm not sure how this works

[15:56] isaacs: jamescarr: you may, but really, you should probably either: a) list coffee-script as a dep, and have a main js file that does require("coffee-script"); require("./my-main-file.coffee")
[15:57] isaacs: jamescarr: or b) list coffee-script as a devDependency, and have a prepublish script that does `cake build` and converts all your .coffee files to js

[16:06] dtan: afternoon over here, cachemoney
[16:06] tuhoojabotti: They obviously caused it.
[16:06] tjholowaychuk: jamey-uk yeah if req.body is defined connect-form will ignore it
[16:06] tjholowaychuk: so you can use both
[16:06] jamey-uk: eh, sorry I don't follow… as soon as I removed the bodyParser() my faulty .post() route worked… how does that mean they will work together?

[16:09] jamey-uk: tjholowaychuk: yeah, I tried console.log()'ing req.body and req.form and both are undefined for that POST. It works for the file upload POST, but as soon I remove the .bodyParser() line that undefined POST works as expected… so I don't understand how bodyParser() is going to be compatible with connect-form here...?
[16:09] tjholowaychuk: hmm
[16:09] tjholowaychuk: if bodyParser was below
[16:09] DarylM has joined the channel
[16:09] ctide: ah, i was trying ot figure this out on friday actually

[16:09] cachemoney: is bodyParser even documented
[16:09] tjholowaychuk: hmm not sure
[16:09] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[16:10] ctide: using oauth2-server which expected connect-form
[16:10] ctide: and it was just empty always
[16:10] tjholowaychuk: cachemoney it's in connect
[16:10] cachemoney: tjholowaychuk: ah
[16:10] jamey-uk: yeah I tried to read that documentation, can anyone find anything that documents thsi?
[16:10] jamey-uk: this*

[16:11] ch009861: So I've asked this question out on the Google Group before: How many concurrent, outbound HTTP requests (e.g. to an API) are too many?  Is there a good benchmark or tool to figure out the best number?

[16:11] jamey-uk: okie doke :P i'm not very experienced with writing docs, I'm not exactly sure programmatically how it works ;)
[16:11] tjholowaychuk: slaskis you can inherit from the compiler and pass { compiler: whatever }
[16:12] tjholowaychuk: slaskis so if you're using express and want that compiler all the time app.set('view options

[17:24] mraleph: junkee[]: there are two types of handles in V8: Local handles and Persistent.
[17:24] junkee[]: mraleph: mhh.. why I need the presistent?
[17:24] mraleph: junkee[]: Local handles basically live on the stack and a valid only while their parent HandleScope is alive.
[17:24] junkee[]: mraleph: okay. I understand
[17:25] mraleph: junkee[]: as soon as you leave that HandleScope all Local handles are garbage
[17:25] mraleph: junkee[]: you should put weak persistent handles into your map

[17:25] markwubben has joined the channel
[17:27] mraleph: junkee[]: well maybe you don't want weak but you should consider using them :-) if you have some object O and you have Persistent handle that refers to it then O will not die while that handle is alive.

[17:28] junkee[]: mraleph: you're right. but how do I convert a handle to a weak persistent?
[17:28] dve: is  there anything built into node for rounding numbers to specified deciaml palces?
[17:28] mraleph: weak persistent handles are different. if V8 sees that only weak persistent handles refer to object that object will be GCed and you weak persistent handle will get a callback notifing you about it

[17:28] indutny: mraleph: oh, you're here too?
[17:28] tbranyen: dve: nope but there is in v8/javascript
[17:28] tbranyen: dve: toFixed
[17:28] dve: does that round or just trim?
[17:28] tbranyen: dve: try it and see
[17:28] dmcquay has joined the channel
[17:29] mraleph: junkee[]: see methods of Persistent class. You can make new pers. handle with Persistent::New and make it weak with MakeWeak.
[17:29] mraleph: indutny: yep.
[17:29] junkee[]: mraleph: thank you veeery much :)

[17:30] mraleph: indutny: is there something strange about the profile you get yourself?

[17:30] MonsieurLu has joined the channel
[17:30] tbranyen: dve: no worries
[17:30] indutny: mraleph: nothing strange, but probably I'm missing something
[17:30] MonsieurLu has left the channel
[17:30] mraleph: indutny: well I see some graphs on project's page.
[17:31] indutny: mraleph: I think that it can work better
[17:31] indutny: mraleph: 600 writes per second isn't to much for it
[17:31] indutny: mraleph: probably GC is killing it
[17:32] mraleph: indutny: oh you said a magic word, let me just take a quick look :-) 
[17:32] indutny: mraleph: hahaha :) yeah, GC is a black magic
[17:32] tauren has joined the channel
[17:32] indutny: mraleph: it's intentionally working with Buffers
[17:32] indutny: mraleph: so probably they're getting GC too often
[17:33] mraleph: indutny: is it on npm or I have to clone your repo?
[17:33] indutny: mraleph: or I can't understand that pikes on benchmark plot
[17:33] indutny: mraleph: better clone
[17:33] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[17:33] indutny: mraleph: and you can run node test/fs-basic-benchmark.js
[17:34] indutny: mraleph: but you'll need to install vows and etc locally, `npm install` in node-index folder should be enough

[17:37] bpierre: taf2: require() paths do not seem to be updated? https://github.com/taf2/fork.node/blob/master/lib/tiamat.js

[17:38] indutny: jerrysv: hehe, you're good at promoting yourself. First - asking questions, then answering them ;)
[17:38] junkee[]: mraleph: What are the parameters in Persistent::MakeWeak for?
[17:39] indutny: jerrysv: I'm not sure about that, but you can write your module for it
[17:39] STUPIDWIFI has joined the channel
[17:39] mraleph: junkee[]: documentation should be pretty comprehensive. one is callback the other is arbitrary data that will be passed to callback 
[17:39] indutny: jerrysv: because I don't want native dependency for node-index
[17:40] mraleph: junkee[]: callback is invoked when V8's GC determines that object became weakly reachable and is about to die
[17:40] jerrysv: indutny: not really trying to promote, but was curious -- it helps solve the gc slow-downs, which is where a lot of the gain came from

[17:44] zmbmartin: tjholowaychuk: if I set a app.error page for 500 isn't that supposed to be showed? I am getting the standard express 500 error?
[17:45] dtan: zmbmartin: what does the error say exactly?
[17:45] Skola: well the standard error has a stacktrace
[17:45] bpierre: taf2: tiamat/config.js does not exists? (sorry if I am wrong, I’m quite a noob)
[17:45] dtan: eazigz: try doing app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'))
[17:46] bpierre: taf2: anyway, if I require('tiamat'), I get an error: Cannot find module 'tiamat/server.js'
[17:47] dtan: bpierre, do you have your package.json file defined in your module?
[17:47] taf2: bpierre, i've been using it as the tiamat command... installing as npm install -g tiamat
[17:47] eazyigz: dtan: that didn't work either
[17:47] zmbmartin: dtan: I am expecting the error I just want to use a custom 500 page
[17:47] taf2: i'm checking now about requiring it like that
[17:48] dtan: right zmbmartin, but like skola said, did you get a stack trace?
[17:48] bpierre: taf2: Oh ok, I tried to run it from my start.js script
[17:48] indutny: mraleph: hehe :)
[17:48] dtan: zmbmartin: if so, can you put that in a pastie for us to look at?

[17:49] bpierre: I call the require() from /scripts/start.js
[17:49] indutny: mraleph: what about GC time?
[17:49] indutny: mraleph: is it high?
[17:49] bpierre: And the node modules are in /
[17:49] mraleph: does not seem to be
[17:49] dtan: bpierre, ok, so is your public folder in the scripts folder?
[17:50] indutny: hm...
[17:50] indutny: so it's slow only because of JSON.parse? :)
[17:50] bpierre: dtan: My application folder?
[17:50] zmbmartin: dtan: Skola https://gist.github.com/1036114
[17:50] junkee[]: mraleph: sorry that I bother you buuut, in the v8 docs it says the callback is "typedef void(* v8::WeakReferenceCallback)(Persistent< Value > object, void *parameter)". Why is this "void Base::deleteRef(Persistent< Value > object, void *obj)" not working then?
[17:51] tjholowaychuk: zmbmartin are you throwing
[17:51] mraleph: there might be other reasons. unfortunately profile is vague because of the inability to deal with VDSO
[17:51] romainhuet has joined the channel
[17:51] mraleph: junkee[]: is your method static?
[17:51] Calvin has joined the channel
[17:51] zmbmartin: tjholowaychuk: yes next(new Error())
[17:51] tjholowaychuk: should be fine
[17:51] tjholowaychuk: unless you have errorHandler() etc
[17:51] junkee[]: mraleph: It cant. I have to change the private map?!
[17:51] dtan: bpierre, i think that where you are setting your static folder is usually relative to where it is being called from
[17:51] tjholowaychuk: that will take precedence
[17:52] tjholowaychuk: because it's defined first
[17:52] dtan: so if you don't have "scripts/public" it won't work
[17:52] junkee[]: mraleph: sry, it can. I can pass this as void*
[17:52] mraleph: junkee[]: well you can't pass a pointer to a non-static member as a pointer to a function. yep you should use void* to pass your object
[17:53] bpierre: dtan: Oh ok sorry, static() works fine when I do not use daemon, so it’s not the problem
[17:53] zmbmartin: tjholowaychuk: ok that was it. I didn't remove errorHandler() thanks
[17:53] ceej has joined the channel
[17:53] bpierre: dtan: It’s the callback on the readFile() in the static middleware which is never called

[17:54] dtan: do you get any sort of stack trace error ?

[17:54] dtan: not even in  your cli?
[17:55] bpierre: It’s really weird, I can resolve the problem by removing the static() middleware, or removing the fillText() in the canvas module…
[17:55] indutny: mraleph: yeah, after reverting that I got 1000 writes per second! :)
[17:56] bpierre: Nope, stdout is logged in a file, and I got nothing, just CPU 100%

[18:00] bpierre: dtan: I tried a setTimeout() just before calling daemon.daemonize(), and it works, until this function is called

[18:04] dtan: so if you have public/css, public/js

[18:23] jbroman: The docs suggest that vm.runInNewContext is dangerous for untrusted code (which makes some sense), but it's vague about what exactly this untrusted code would be able to do. Where can I find out what the problems with it actually are, and how I could run untrusted JavaScript (ideally in-process, though if necessary I could obviously just spawn a separate process running node or v8).
[18:24] sh1mmer: Those all give me a stack trace, but what I actually want is the entire current context enumerated
[18:24] sh1mmer: all the variables

[18:25] swistak: jbroman, are you sure it's about runInNewContext?
[18:26] swistak: AFAIK this is safest method to eval code in node.js 
[18:26] jbroman: swistak: "To prevent accidental global variable leakage, vm.runInNewContext is quite useful, but safely running untrusted code requires a separate process."
[18:26] jbroman: I'm sure it's much much safer than "eval", but this sentence alludes to other problems with it.
[18:27] theycallmeswift: mscdex: sure. Thanks for the help
[18:27] swistak: jbroman, I've played around with different means of running code in node.js and it generally have great isolation
[18:27] jakeg has joined the channel
[18:28] swistak: this is probably something we call 'reinforcing your ass with steel plating' (very bad translation), basically if there should be any bug in vm itself
[18:28] puffpio has joined the channel
[18:28] swistak: running it using vm.runInNewContext will give the mailcious code the same priviledges the server running it has
[18:29] jbroman: swistak: My hope was that by not exposing require and other dangerous things, the untrusted code could not touch that stuff. :P
[18:29] swistak: so to add additional safety it's usually recommended to run such code in separate process with owner set to user without any rights 
[18:29] jbroman: (Also, it would be nice to be able to enforce a time limit on subscripts.)
[18:29] CoverSlide: what's the filename attribute in the vm.* functions do?

[19:07] gustavowt: var jq = requir(jquery)
[19:07] gustavowt: jq.each(object,function)
[19:07] CoverSlide: on object you would have to do for(var i in obj){}
[19:09] gustavowt: CoverSlide, could even use this way, the problem is I have a code in the middle of child_process.exec

[20:14] zmbmartin: my session user or csrf is not
[20:15] tjholowaychuk: yeah, but I meant the http header, I bet it's creating a new session per ajax request (for whatever reason)

[21:34] eazyigz: Hi, I am having a hard time wrapping my head around Node's async style.  When I call a function, it returns right away!  How can I make it return ONLY AFTER it completes some logic??
[21:35] jbroman: eazyigz: The idea is that you try to avoid doing that.
[21:35] CoverSlide:   don't call the function
[21:35] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[21:35] CoverSlide: just pass the function name as a parameter
[21:35] CoverSlide: argument sorry
[21:35] eazyigz: CoverSlide: argument to what?  Another function?
[21:35] CoverSlide: functions are variables too
[21:35] EyePulp: eazyigz: can you paste an example someplace?
[21:35] jbroman: Look at the underlying *reason* you're trying to use synchronous logic – in many cases, you can simply do that in your callback.
[21:36] eazyigz: jbroman: the biggest challenge for me is to understand how to return a value from a function - ONLY AFTER it is computed by the function...
[21:36] jbroman: For example, if you want to read some data and then print it, rather than reading it to a variable and then printing it, you ask for it to be read and provide a function which will be called once the data is available (and in that function, your print it).

[21:51] jbroman: It "returns" by calling the callback.
[21:51] zmbmartin: tjholowaychuk: can I query the session myself? 
[21:51] jbroman: It doesn't have anything meaningful to return when it is initially called. Any logic that would use the return value should be placed in the callback or something called from the callback.
[21:52] EyePulp: eazyigz: getImpressions shouldn't "return" anything - it simply calls a function when it's done with it's results.
[21:52] ezmobius has joined the channel
[21:52] mahna has joined the channel
[21:52] CoverSlide: eazyigz: look at like 2
[21:52] eazyigz: EyePulp: should the callback itself return anything??  Or do I have to resort to just setting global variables?
[21:52] CoverSlide: er 13
[21:52] EyePulp: the function you call is the next step or code to run with the "return"
[21:52] EyePulp: nothing returns anything
[21:52] EyePulp: (that sounds weird)
[21:53] eazyigz: EyePulp: so return statements in Node.js aren't needed?
[21:53] wlkh has joined the channel
[21:53] eazyigz: I mean, I just need to set values that I can use in a different function
[21:53] CoverSlide: the second argument of getImpressions, `cb` gets run on line 13 with the output of client.collection.
[21:53] jbroman: eazyigz: They're less common than in many languages. Certainly not non-existent, though.
[21:53] EyePulp: eazyigz: sure they are, but they aren't needed in some async situations.
[21:53] tchype: anyone in the room use TextMate with node.js?  i wasn't really satisfied with what i saw with Dr. Nic's original bundle, so i made some modifications this weekend.  anyone wanna try it out?
[21:53] EyePulp: tchype: I use that combo
[21:53] tchype: it gives you a fully formatted Run window, like the Ruby run command
[21:54] eazyigz: EyePulp:  I can resort to setting a global variable, but I thought that is bad practice....   Maybe its good practice?
[21:54] CoverSlide: eazyigz: and on line 22 is were you tell it what to do with the `impressions` variable
[21:54] CoverSlide: eazyigz: you don't need global variables with closures
[21:54] CoverSlide: this isn't C
[21:54] EyePulp: eazyigz: No one ever said that was good.  You haven't explained what you're trying to do.
[21:54] jbroman: eazyigz: Your program may need to be refactored if you feel compelled to use global variables. What the best approach is depends on your situation. Closure variables are often one, function parameters are often one, etc.

[21:56] tchype: EyePulp: especially try it out with a syntax error...thanks again!
[21:56] eazyigz: EyePulp: what I am trying to do is have a main function that sets values to be passed to an ejs template.  So each one of those values is determined by a different function.  That is the approach I wanted to tak.

[21:59] Aria: ESB?
[22:00] dall: jbroman, you are right...but without websocket a long polling communication will create a lot of http request, i think it not really improve the load of the server

[22:00] Bwen has joined the channel
[22:00] eazyigz: mkrecny_: yeah, I thought of resorting to EventEmitters.  But being that I'm just passing values to an EJS template, maybe I should just set property values on a global object

[22:00] Nuck: Mornin' forks.
[22:00] jbroman: dall: Web Sockets are useful for some things, but I don't expect them to completely replace XHR. They will just become progressively more supported (and thus more useful) over time.

[22:02] EyePulp: eazyigz: that's an option, but there are better ways.   A lot of times it depends on what sort of structure and data re-use you're shooting for.  It might be worthwhile for you to write some small parts first to get comfortable with the callback style.
[22:02] Aria: (also: separate processes!)
[22:02] dall: Aria, sure, are not heavy but, to send a message i have to open a new tcp connection, and then again and again...it's not very good for me

[22:04] slickplaid: hmm
[22:04] EyePulp: eazyigz: be aware that using in-memory globals is a bad choice if you want to do higher traffic loads, as the memory isn't shared if you use something like "cluster" to run multiple workers.  consider storing to a redis/mongo DB backend.

[22:05] Nuck: It asbolutely does NOT cause cancer.
[22:05] beriberikix: Aria: Agreed V8 is unhorrible, ESB typically transforms huge XML files with lots of Nesting and transformation rules
[22:05] CStumph has joined the channel
[22:05] Aria: Yeah, it's reasonable. It's a linear factor of expense.  Not as good as pure TCP, but if it's not available, there's no point in throwing up one's hands.
[22:05] beriberikix: I could see writing the mediation piece in C++
[22:06] Aria: beriberikix: So offload that into separate processes. Why have it all in core at once anyway?
[22:06] eazyigz: EyePulp:  I will if I end up working with a lot of data.  But this is a simple analytics dashboard, and the data won't change frequently

[23:09] zmbmartin: the docs say something about function compile but I just use this line --> app.use(require('stylus').middleware({ src: __dirname + '/public' }));
[23:09] zmbmartin: how do I add nib to that?
[23:10] isaacs: llrcombs: if you set the content-length it won't do that.  also, if you set the transfer-encoding yourself, it won't
[23:10] wadey has joined the channel
[23:10] isaacs: llrcombs: it *has* to do that in order to stream data, though, because otherwise the receiving end won't know when it's through or how to separate chunks.
[23:10] isaacs: llrcombs: the status code is set when you do writeHead(200)

[23:11] tjholowaychuk: the "use()" method
[23:11] llrcombs: it sends its own response codes and headers
[23:11] isaacs: llrcombs: ok
[23:11] llrcombs: most requests are regular HTTP, and I use node's methods
[23:11] isaacs: llrcombs: well, you know, http and cgi are not the same protocol, exactly
[23:11] isaacs: afaik

[23:12] isaacs: llrcombs: right.  so, are you writing cgi scripts, or node programs?
[23:12] isaacs: or a node program that has to talk to cgi scripts?

[23:12] isaacs: ok
[23:13] jacobolus has joined the channel
[23:13] devrim has joined the channel
[23:13] llrcombs: oh, wait
[23:13] llrcombs: it looks like the server still has to send the status code (usually 200)
[23:14] llrcombs: but the script sends the headers (though the server can add to them)
[23:14] llrcombs: so what I really need is for node not to stick \r\n\r\n after its own headers
[23:15] jerrysv: llrcombs: or better yet. parse the response from the cgi script, grab the headers, and add them correctly with node, then return the rest of the body
[23:15] isaacs: llrcombs: isn't there a node-cgi program floating around that can do this?
[23:15] isaacs: llrcombs: yeah, what jerrysv said
[23:15] sridatta has joined the channel
[23:16] llrcombs: jerrysv: I considered that, but parsing headers out is painful!
[23:16] isaacs: llrcombs: yep.
[23:16] jerrysv: how is it painful? search for the first \r\n\r\n, anything before that is headers. split on ':'
[23:16] isaacs: llrcombs: also, node's writeHead does some fancy stuff based on what the client can handle.
[23:16] isaacs: jerrysv: there are a few more edge cases.
[23:16] llrcombs: what isaacs said
[23:17] jerrysv: llrcombs: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-cgi
[23:17] llrcombs: already there
[23:17] jerrysv: isaacs: yeah, edge cases, but unless llrcombs has an unlimited number of scripts to run, those edge cases can be known and worked around

[23:27] tjholowaychuk: Nuck because u inherit some methods from it's proto
[23:27] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: I do?
[23:27] Nuck: Which ones?
[23:28] tjholowaychuk: there's Store#regenerate() and Store#createSession() right now
[23:28] tjholowaychuk: nothing huge

[23:34] Nuck: Ugh I'm gonna hafta use a LOT of curry to make this work with Mongo
[23:34] tjholowaychuk: there used to be one that worked just fine
[23:34] tjholowaychuk: it's basic GET/SET stuff
[23:35] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: I know, but using it with async stuff and using a single connection, etc.
[23:35] tjholowaychuk: connect-redis is async
[23:35] Nuck: All my get and set stuff would hafta be nested a few callbacks deep.
[23:35] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: Yeah, and async with this is pretty easy (since it's using callbacks), but the using a single connection is a bit harder
[23:36] Nuck: Since Mongo-native uses callbacks to make connections async and such
[23:36] tjholowaychuk: i dont get the problem :s
[23:36] tjholowaychuk: just have one connection open
[23:36] tjholowaychuk: leave it open
