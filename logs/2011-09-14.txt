[00:25] vIkSiT: I have a node.js based server (using socket.io) that reads a file and outputs it line by line
[00:25] vIkSiT: however, this only works with a single client.
[00:25] vIkSiT: I was wondering - what are some examples of multi-client node.js code that deals with something like this?

[00:29] vIkSiT: CraigMaslowski, https://gist.github.com/efa628e4c63af208df0b
[00:29] nuck has joined the channel
[00:29] vIkSiT: this is an example of what i'm doing. by one client i mean - if I use one browser tab to connect to the server, it works fine. But that particular process is now only serving the one browser.
[00:29] vIkSiT: another tab would require some sort of handler - be it another process or thread, or something
[00:30] vIkSiT: my question was - since each client is basically blocked on this file, is it possible for me to build something that just "broadcasts" whatever state the file tailer is in to any client which connects?
[00:30] JaKWaC has joined the channel
[00:31] vIkSiT: CraigMaslowski, (does that help understand my question at all?)
[00:31] CraigMaslowski: @vlkSiT never seen lazy before, so not really.
[00:32] vIkSiT: CraigMaslowski, what if I was using a pure readstream then?
[00:32] CornflakesForTea has joined the channel
[00:32] vIkSiT: I'm guessing the issue isn't with the way I read the file, as it is in creating a way for any client to latch on to whatever is being broadcast by the file tailer..
[00:33] CraigMaslowski: have you tried using a pure readstream?
[00:33] vIkSiT: not yet
[00:33] Nexxy: pubsub the output of the tailing method?
[00:34] joe-f2 has joined the channel
[00:34] CraigMaslowski: i dunno if lazy is the problem (probably not if you're sure of it's usage), but i'd try a normal readstream and see if it works.
[00:34] joe-f2: node_redis is constantly sending error events, and not liking key's with values of JSON.. any workarounds?
[00:35] CraigMaslowski: if i understand what lazy is doing though, it looks like you're emitting the message in the right place though
[00:36] criswell has joined the channel
[00:36] CraigMaslowski: and that should send it to all connected clients
[00:36] vIkSiT: CraigMaslowski, hmm
[00:38] cjheath has joined the channel
[00:39] vIkSiT: CraigMaslowski, question about multiple clients here.
[00:40] vIkSiT: If I have one node.js server running like this, won't multiple clients get blocked on such an IO process?
[00:40] tilgovi has joined the channel
[00:40] tilgovi has joined the channel
[00:41] CraigMaslowski: well this is where i'm assuming what lazy does. you should be reading your file asynchronously and sending on the data event
[00:42] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[00:42] vIkSiT: i see.
[00:42] vIkSiT: could you also point me to the non lazy way of doing it in node?

[00:43] CraigMaslowski: http://docs.nodejitsu.com/articles/file-system/how-to-read-files-in-nodejs
[00:44] vIkSiT: freewil, I do
[00:44] slifty has joined the channel
[00:44] vIkSiT: freewil, what I'm trying to figure out is - how to read a very large file aysnchronously, and broadcast that using socket.io

[00:46] Nexxy: + on data event
[00:46] stepheneb has joined the channel

[00:48] devaholic: did you enjoy yourself
[00:48] Nexxy: it was ok
[00:48] Nexxy: but still, for what vIkSiT is describing
[00:48] Nexxy: nowjs sounds spot-on
[00:48] Nexxy: unless I missed something
[00:49] devaholic: oh okay
[00:49] devaholic: i havent used nowjs
[00:49] Nexxy: it's like
[00:49] CraigMaslowski: socketstream > nowjs as far as realtime frameworks go, imo
[00:49] devaholic: but i read about it back right after they got into or out of yc or whatever
[00:49] Nexxy: a toy version of RMI
[00:49] jtsnow has joined the channel
[00:49] devaholic: i couldnt into it

[00:50] Nexxy: that's kind of like "Hey I need to cut a piece of cake..." "USE THIS MACHETE!!!"
[00:50] vIkSiT: hmm, how do you define a real time framework here? :)
[00:51] devaholic: you want to relay a stream that is being uploaded to a bunch of browsers?
[00:51] CraigMaslowski: yeah, probably not. SS doesn't quite implement the "magic pocket" like nowjs does. 
[00:51] mynyml has joined the channel
[00:52] dinarcon has joined the channel
[00:52] vIkSiT: devaholic, yeap. 
[00:52] vIkSiT: this could be used to tail a particualr log file, for instance
[00:53] Nexxy: or as a node.js shoutcast relay!
[00:53] devaholic: you can use hook.io
[00:53] vIkSiT: hrm. couchdb based system~
[00:56] k1ttty has joined the channel
[00:56] vIkSiT: hmm. CraigMaslowski, freewil , Nexxy - so what I have now uses the default read stream
[00:56] vIkSiT: and still no dice on two browsers being able to get the streamed output of that file
[00:57] CraigMaslowski: i was just looking at your gist again. have you tried client.emit('message', 'your json string') ?
[00:57] CraigMaslowski: instead of client.json.send
[00:57] vIkSiT: hmmm
[00:58] DTrejo has joined the channel
[00:58] vIkSiT: CraigMaslowski, whats the difference there?
[00:58] CraigMaslowski: actually, i'm not sure what client.json is. i'm still getting familiar with socket.io myself.
[00:59] zackattack has joined the channel
[00:59] CraigMaslowski: when i tried to console.log(client.json) in some of my code, i got json is undefined

[01:00] dshaw_1 has joined the channel
[01:00] ericmuyser has joined the channel
[01:01] vIkSiT: emit is actually a custom Event
[01:01] vIkSiT: rather than a message
[01:01] vIkSiT: send emits the "Message" event and then the content to go with it..

[02:22] chapel: why do you want to emit lines of a file?
[02:22] djMax: and is that a perf problem at all?
[02:23] vIkSiT: chapel, a log file tailer accessible over a network
[02:23] neoesque has joined the channel
[02:23] chapel: so it will only read lines as long as someone is connected
[02:23] chapel: otherwise it stops tailing?
[02:24] vIkSiT: chapel, for that, I can store total number of "connect" events and when it drops to 0, stop tailing

[02:25] chapel: vIkSiT: simply put I would on the start of the server, open the file, get it ready to tail, then when someone connects it starts a loop (or a watch) which fires off an event or callback that sends the data to any connected sockets
[02:26] chapel: and yeah, you can watch connected sockets too
[02:26] vIkSiT: hmm makes sense
[02:27] chapel: using a file watcher might be better for this too
[02:27] vIkSiT: I was using a file watcher earlier
[02:27] vIkSiT: except - this particular use case involves streaming data from the first line of a file till the end
[02:27] vIkSiT: so it has to be "read"
[02:28] chapel: well sure
[02:28] chapel: just saying, there is a point where you just want to only watch for changes
[02:28] vIkSiT: right
[02:28] vIkSiT: and fswatcher would serve admirably there..

[02:40] astropirate: its connects pretty much as the page loads when i run it locally but on their platform it takes a good 15 seconds
[02:40] SubStack: astropirate: could be on account of the proxying
[02:40] astropirate: after page load

[02:42] astropirate: SubStack, i will try that but that doesnt' account for why its fast locally and slow on joyant

[02:45] githogori has joined the channel
[02:45] SubStack: if you have to re-require all the same stuff there's probably a better way to organize your code
[02:46] SubStack: by passing around database handles and app instances as parameters for instance
[02:46] djMax: yeah, so if in app.js I require mongodb, rabbitmq, validation, etc that seems rough
[02:46] djMax: and if I do that, my functions will have a bazillion parameters
[02:46] vIkSiT: btw, does anyone have a working example of client.broadcast in socket.io?
[02:46] SubStack: why would you require mongodb twice?
[02:46] djMax: might as well make them globals if everybody uses them.
[02:46] SubStack: no
[02:46] SubStack: NEVER DO THAT
[02:46] vIkSiT:  client.broadcast({ tail: "abc" }); - TypeError: Property 'broadcast' of object #<Socket> is not a function
[02:46] djMax: don't I have to require it twice?
[02:47] djMax: once in app.js and once in "other place that uses it"?
[02:47] SubStack: I mean
[02:47] SubStack: no
[02:47] JSManiacs: curl http://mocker.no.de/socket.io/socket.io.js
[02:47] SubStack: why would you?
[02:47] SubStack: that's really silly
[02:47] SubStack: just pass around db as a parameter
[02:47] SubStack: set up the db in one place, pass it to where it needs to go
[02:47] djMax: to every method?
[02:47] SubStack: that's encapsulation 101
[02:47] JSManiacs: ops, sorry- that wasn't supposed to be copied there
[02:47] JSManiacs: ha
[02:47] SubStack: djMax: 'every' method?
[02:48] djMax: well no, encapsulation in this case would be passing some context around, but that's essentially just global-ish.
[02:48] SubStack: djMax: ah have you seen how app.use() works?
[02:48] djMax: haven't seen app.use.
[02:48] djMax: will rtfm on that

[07:05] isaacs: acrolith: what's tar ---version report?
[07:05] vee: I just successfully installed node on Linux using standard installation howto. However when I do whereis node command nothing comes up. Any ideas?

[07:06] mendel__ has joined the channel
[07:06] isaacs: acrolith: that's too ancient.  get a newer tar.

[07:07] isaacs: might come with xcode, though, who knows

[07:08] mikey_p: not sure what I did, but I've got bsdtar at /usr/bin/tar on Lion with xcode

[07:09] djcoin has joined the channel
[07:09] acrolith: @mikey_p yeah.. i've had older versions installed on snow leopard, just not since lion. Guess I'll play video games until it's installed... #lame

[07:35] nuck: Marak » haha very true, but when you're being told by folks like SubStack that it's a bad idea, you start to second-guess your choices. Hence why I'm second-guessing using globals for globals.
[07:35] Ezku: nuck: riiight. Way to go with missing the point as well, then. _b
[07:36] Marak: nuck: there is no guess involved

[07:36] nuck: That means 12 connections to my db for one server :S

[07:40] chapel: nuck: you said you didn't want to have to pass them around, even though its really not that much to do so
[07:40] nuck: chapel » I have a require b which requires c
[07:40] stride: nuck: you want database access in.. your templates, loggin module, every external module you include in your project?
[07:40] stride: s/loggin/logging/
[07:40] ablomen: nuck, btw, i don't think it would make 12 connections
[07:40] nuck: And b is async
[07:40] Marak: this is like a bad practice staircase fall
[07:40] nuck: stride » I have more than just "templates"
[07:41] ablomen: it should only run whatever is required once, then be used for future requires
[07:41] stride: nuck: it's a webapp, right?
[07:41] Marak: if you find yourself at the bottom of the stairwell with broken legs, you shouldn't be considering trying to crawl back up
[07:41] nuck: Yeah, I have too many templates to have them in one file
[07:41] Marak: just walk up each step surely and with firm footing
[07:41] ivan` has joined the channel
[07:41] ablomen: (a simple test case shows this to be true btw, just try requiring a file that does console.log("foo"); in it in multiple files, you will only see foo once)
[07:41] nuck: Marak » haha, well, it's early on, I'm about to decide if I wanna fall or not ;)
[07:42] eddyb has joined the channel
[07:42] nuck: ablomen » But if I make a variable in that module, then require it in 5 things I require() in another file
[07:42] nuck: Will that variable be the same in all 5?
[07:42] ablomen: should be, try it
[07:42] nuck: If so, problem is fucking solved.
[07:42] Marak: best to start with best practice. instead of technical debt, you will gain improvements over time.

[07:43] Marak: eboyjr: did you try http://jsperf.com/

[07:43] nuck: And then when that got rather unwieldy (which I think is to be expected), I switched to globals
[07:43] Marak: eddyb http://jsperf.com/
[07:43] eddyb: thanks, gonna check it out
[07:44] nuck: ablomen » I'll test that, it's a very good question
[07:44] Marak: nuck: give your app an init state
[07:44] chapel: nuck: how did it get unwieldy, still don't understand how it was a problem
[07:44] Marak: nuck: that is run once on start, and the callback is when all your connections are setup
[07:44] nuck: Marak » I'm gonna try ablomen's concept, that it's all shared, because that's an interesting thought
[07:44] Marak: nuck: then after that, pass your db connection to all your models.....or maybe controllers....
[07:44] nuck: And if it truly works that way, it'll mean things are easy
[07:44] hackband has joined the channel
[07:44] nuck: Marak » I'm not a strict MVC

[07:45] eddyb: Marak: that's a cool app, I like it :)
[07:45] nuck: chapel » That's what I thought, but if it's all one instance if I load the same file multiple times in one process
[07:46] jbpros has joined the channel
[07:46] chapel: well the required file is cached
[07:46] nuck: Which may be the case (if it is, that's fucking useful)
[07:46] chapel: thats for sure
[07:46] ablomen: chapel, like i said earlier, if you require something that console.log's something over multiple files, it only console.logs ones
[07:46] Marak: nuck: we require the top level module in every module it requires
[07:46] nuck: That leads me to wonder if it'll work if I try to share variables that way
[07:46] Marak: nuck: so that is a circular dep
[07:46] Marak: nuck: and node is totally cool with it
[07:46] ablomen: so if it only does console.log once, it should work with a db connection too, no?
[07:46] whitman has joined the channel
[07:47] burningdog has joined the channel

[07:48] Marak: nuck: i mean, sounds like a personal question, look at how nodejitsu sets up its projects

[07:48] Marak: if you have destructive calls in your app.js, its not gonna work, that is why i told you to make init method
[07:49] nuck: Marak » all those required versions of the original file, do they all access the same instance?
[07:49] Marak: whats a destructive call? anything that is run that does stuff in the global module scope
[07:49] Marak: nuck: yep, its cached
[07:49] nuck: Marak » That's the big thing I needed to hear!
[07:49] chapel: nuck: have you tested it?
[07:49] nuck: That means I jsut require('./db.js');
[07:49] Marak: we should really do a blog post about this
[07:49] nuck: chapel » I'm working on that

We want to create a LED Matrix with included Switches, so you can push an LED and it switches it's state. As an addition to this we want to create a Web Gui where you can controll the LED's too. The Idea is that alle the panels wheter physical or only in the web are synchonous. The Web UI should send

[08:32] uchuff has joined the channel
[08:32] isaacs: ullrich: you should still check the keys, if you know what they'll be

[08:33] ullrich: true. it's always a bad idea to trust everybody
[08:33] ullrich: but i'll add this as an option
[08:34] pfried_: the physical clients can get the state from the server and submit it to the server. We have two Prototypes communicating by TCP/IP based on an AVR Microcontroller. The node server should manage the state of the LEDs. It would be cool if the Client be up to date without a browser refresh

[09:07] nuck: You know what'd be nice in Node?  Some way to set the root folder for a project
[09:08] bzinger has joined the channel
[09:08] nuck: So I could stop doing relative paths in require()
[09:08] maqr has joined the channel
[09:08] xerox: do you really need to
[09:09] nuck: Well, in a project with subfolders which require from other subfolders, it gets ugly to keep doing "../../../thing/foo/bar.js"
[09:09] xerox: maybe you could break it into different node_modules
[09:09] xerox: so that you can just require 'thing' ?
[09:09] nuck: I'd like to be able to just set something and have Node add the top of my project to the require() automatically
[09:09] Orion-: you could unshift the search paths
[09:09] nuck: xerox » Sadly, not really :/
[09:09] nuck: Orion- » Gone in 0.5.x
[09:10] nuck: require.paths is dead
[09:10] nuck: And for good reason
[09:10] Orion-: but 0.5 is not stable
[09:10] nuck: It's too much power, it was abused
[09:10] nuck: Orion- » Aye, but 0.6.x will be
[09:10] nuck: And it too will lack that
[09:10] Orion-: w8'n'c
[09:10] nuck: oh dear god
[09:11] nuck: I thought you'd let a cat step on your keyboard
[09:11] nuck: Before I realized it was "wait and see"
[09:11] Orion-: :D
[09:11] nuck: But no, it's completely gone for good.
[09:11] Orion-: I too was amazed by the result :)
[09:11] nuck: They've made it quite clear it's dead.
[09:11] nuck: xerox » Something like that, yeah
[09:12] nuck: If I could set my project root for a process, I could make much better code
[09:12] nuck: Well, *cleaner* code

[09:14] biom: I use node in a project, I need to read JSON files, and add the JSON file in mongodb. I read the file, that fine, but I can't add the content of each JSON in the db. That the code for the insertion: db.insert(jsonData)
[09:15] skratool has joined the channel
[09:15] nuck: biom » Well, obviously that's not your problem, try posting your code on gist.github.com
[09:15] nuck: And I'm sure somebody will help you
[09:15] nuck: Maybe not me, since I may or may not be going to bed soon.  Haven't decided yet.

[09:17] biom: xerox > I will take a look on that, thanks!
[09:17] webben has joined the channel
[09:17] xerox: that's for the npm module 'mongodb'
[09:17] xerox: not 'mongoskin'

[09:17] xerox: which does have examples too

[09:31] tauren: OT question, but maybe someone has some suggestions. Does everyone just use curl to experiment with REST apis? if not, what?
[09:31] Croms has joined the channel
[09:31] robinduckett: tauren: i just use request :P
[09:31] nuck: tauren » I'd use cURL yeah
[09:31] dnjaramba has joined the channel
[09:32] nuck: I also build a form on the client side sometimes
[09:32] nuck: And then read the response in the browser
[09:32] tauren: robinduckett: that's certainly an option! :)
[09:32] nuck: No need for AJAX when there's no need to make shit pretty :D
[09:32] tauren: nuck: that's just the thing. if i want to post stuff with lots of auth headers and crap, i'm just wondering if there is a more gui based tool to do it.
[09:33] KyleReese301: Is it possible to run PHP on a Node.js server?
[09:33] pen has joined the channel
[09:33] robinduckett: request({uri: 'resturl'}, function(err, res, body) {JSON.parse(body)});

[09:34] nuck: tauren » Sadly, no :)
[09:34] nuck: Er, :(
[09:34] nuck: tauren » However, if you find one, tell me, because I could really use it :P
[09:35] tauren: robinduckett: yeah, for get's that's not bad. but posting with extra headers and such gets messier. still, that might still be better than curl.
[09:35] tauren: nuck: sure will!

[14:11] nuck: rurufufuss » Why not hook into the storage mechanism?
[14:12] nuck: Or are you not using a database?
[14:12] nuck: If not, you might be risking scalability beyond a few people :/

[14:12] rurufufuss: to, say, the top 50
[14:13] nuck: rurufufuss » Well, for modules, they're generally separate C++ things, but I'm sure you can find some way to overcome that
[14:13] rurufufuss: where can I read more about V8 engine module?

[16:09] felixge_ has joined the channel
[16:09] pandeiro: looks like weird bash escape codes or something
[16:09] joshkehn: Those look like bash escape codes.
[16:09] joshkehn: The question I have is where are you using the repl in emacs? 
[16:09] joshkehn: Admitted vim user here.
[16:09] joshkehn: :)
[16:09] pandeiro: in shell
[16:09] pandeiro: M-x shell
[16:09] joshkehn: Ah
[16:10] jerrysv: pandeiro: maybe try: ^Z followed by node
[16:10] smtlaissezfaire has joined the channel
[16:10] joshkehn: I do C-z out of vim.
[16:10] felixge has joined the channel
[16:10] joshkehn: Then I do whatever I need and `fg` back.
[16:10] jerrysv: yup
[16:10] unomi has joined the channel
[16:10] jerrysv: or fire up another terminal
[16:11] pandeiro: hunh now how do I un-C-z? lol lost my emacs
[16:11] mbrevoort has joined the channel
[16:11] joshkehn: fg
[16:11] Margle has joined the channel
[16:12] joshkehn: foreground 
[16:12] joshkehn: You can also do things like
[16:12] joshkehn: tail -f /var/log/somelogfile.log
[16:12] joshkehn: C-z
[16:12] joshkehn: Then bg to throw it into the background.
[16:12] pandeiro: ah ok
[16:12] mrkishi has joined the channel
[16:13] joshkehn: fg / bg are [fore | back]ground commands related to process stopping (C-z)
[16:13] jerrysv: ACTION spent 15 years as an emacs user, but still can't understand why people try to use it as their whole OS
[16:13] pandeiro: so obviously using node in another process works but the advantage of using it inside emacs is i can randomly eval code from inside my programs while editing
[16:13] gazumps has joined the channel
[16:13] joshkehn: Um
[16:13] joshkehn: I guess.
[16:13] joshkehn: I wouldn't really call that a big advantage when the escaping jacks up.

[16:19] djMax has joined the channel
[16:19] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[16:20] djMax: So with the async programming model of node, if you have some work that is only done in some cases (i.e. inside an if), do you just make a separate fn and call it from both sides of the if?
[16:21] DougReeder: What happened to path.normalizeArray in v0.4?  Is it just gone without replacement?
[16:21] joshkehn: You try to avoid that kind of logic branching. ;)
[16:21] hij1nx has joined the channel
[16:21] tbranyen: djMax: make a function that takes in a callback, and do everything inside that other function conditionally and always call the callback when everything is done?
[16:21] zhware has joined the channel
[16:21] djMax: don't see how I could. In one case I have to put a record in mongo because I don't have it yet, and in one case I don't
[16:22] djMax: yeah, tbranyen I think that's what I meant, as in "if (something) { doAsyncStuff(afterIt); } else { afterIt(); }"
[16:22] tbranyen: djMax: function updateOrCreate(cb) { if (create) { return asyncMongo(function() { cb(); }) } asyncMongoUpdate(function() { cb(); });  }
[16:22] tbranyen: something like that
[16:22] tbranyen: only not on one line
[16:23] joshkehn: djMax: What tbranyen is saying. 
[16:23] djMax: I guess I'm doing the inside out version of that, but it makes my head hurt a lot less.
[16:24] tbranyen: the inside out version doesn't read nearly as well and breaks the flow of anyone trying to read your code
[16:24] joshkehn: You mean you have the control structures outside of the function? 
[16:24] djMax: in node.js, when I do something to the response, like say redirect, do I still get to execute code after it?
[16:24] joshkehn: I don't see why not, you're only passing information to the response.
[16:24] joshkehn: You can say something like.
[16:24] djMax: I just mean that after either the async function completes or if the condition isn't satisfied, I call the rest of the process in a separate fn.
[16:24] joshkehn: res.send() and then continue after
[16:25] djMax: but I think maybe I see the other option - make the whole lookup/insertion logic a separate fn and pass it the callback.
[16:25] djMax: which I assume is what you guys are saying

[16:25] djMax: seems generally six of one half dozen of the other, but I get it.
[16:26] DougReeder has left the channel
[16:26] djMax: Just trying to make sure I never find myself 3 callbacks deep because that's a sign of doom
[16:26] freeformz has joined the channel
[16:27] Glenjamin: being a few callbacks deep is fine
[16:27] djMax: In a single fn I find that it makes it basically unreadable.
[16:27] Glenjamin: you can structure your code so that when reading it you a) don't really know how deep you are and b) don't care
[16:27] Glenjamin: ah, yes
[16:27] Glenjamin: 3 deep in one place is bad
[16:27] djMax: When your indents start at charpos like 40, it's hell.
[16:27] Glenjamin: use a control flow lib to abstract that stuff out
[16:27] djMax: Is there a well traveled one?
[16:28] Glenjamin: https://github.com/caolan/async
[16:28] Glenjamin: is my favourite

[16:29] djMax: the thing I don't quite get about libs like that... In series() for example, how would I know WHERE the error occurred?
[16:29] DrMcKay: btw, is there a flow library returning functions instead of calling them?
[16:29] Circlefusion has joined the channel
[16:29] djMax: some closure variable?
[16:30] Glenjamin: djMax: the (err) argument will be an exception, with a stack trace
[16:30] tmcw has joined the channel
[16:30] djMax: but working with stack traces in code is not a workable solution
[16:31] Glenjamin: can you give an example of where you think this is a problem?
[16:31] alvaro_o has joined the channel
[16:32] Glenjamin: either you get a recoverable exception, which you know by its type - or you dont. And if you dont you log a stack trace and die
[16:32] Glenjamin: DrMcKay: how do you mean?
[16:32] Glenjamin: async.series(..) vs async.series(..).run() ?
[16:33] Glenjamin: i think seq works like that

[21:53] CoverSlide: just like everything on debian
[21:54] _baton__: bnoordhuis, so the right way is to install it from source ?
[21:54] nuck: In Mongoose, is the callback for .save() called no matter what or just if there's an error?
[21:54] creationix: mage, that's the magical build system
[21:54] bnoordhuis: _baton__: i don't want to use the terms right or wrong
[21:54] CoverSlide: it's unix; source is always the right way
[21:54] _baton__: bnoordhuis, I see
[21:55] bnoordhuis: _baton__: but if you want the newest features, bug fixes, etc. then yes, you'll have to build from source
[21:55] creationix: _baton__: use https://github.com/creationix/nvm to install from source, but not clobber your system
[21:55] Tobbe_: tjholowaychuk: thanks, but how is one supposed to know those things? can't find it in the readme... :)
[21:55] nuck: I'm not a bit Unixperson, but it's true
[21:55] creationix: TooTallNate: you here?

[22:04] level09: but I want to stay away from php
[22:04] nuck: level09 » Define "web service"?
[22:04] creationix: It would be neat if http_parser has a third mode that's not "request" or "response"
[22:04] creationix: just parsed the headers and body
[22:04] level09: nuck: basically, I have some devs working on iOS / mobile apps 
[22:04] level09: and I want to give them access to my news website through some form
[22:04] level09: nuck: I am thinking of building a json server
[22:05] level09: using express
[22:05] level09: but I'm still not sure about how to implement authentication
[22:05] nuck: level09 » You would probably hook Node directly into the database backend
[22:05] level09: nuck: exactly
[22:05] nuck: As for authentication, use whatever's already in place
[22:05] nuck: level09 » That's a setup where Node is *beside* PHP
[22:05] nuck: It wouldn't be "on top", so to speak
[22:06] mikeal: how do i *not* compile with libuv?
[22:06] tjholowaychuk: level09 res.json(obj), doesn't get much simpler than that
[22:06] creationix: hmm, that's not so easy, the http_parser code assumes there are only two modes and is optimized for that case
[22:06] level09: I tested mysql module and it seems to work fine
[22:06] level09: nuck: what do you recommend for authentication ?
[22:06] level09: I'm a a bit not sure how to implement that
[22:06] level09: does express have anything by default ?
[22:06] level09: there will be no public access, so perhaps there is no need for API keys etc … 
[22:06] nuck: tjholowaychuk » Or res.send(obj)
[22:07] tjholowaychuk: level09 nope express doesnt couple with any db
[22:07] level09: tjholowaychuk: yes, that part is very easy, but what do you recommend for authentication ?
[22:07] level09: should I do it at the JS level ? or the http headers level 
[22:07] nuck: Hopefully I'll have an oAuth2 server as express middleware eventually, but until then, you decide
[22:07] level09: I haven't worked much with web services before
[22:07] nuck: level09 » Try HTTP Basic Auth?
[22:08] tjholowaychuk: really depends, there are many many ways you could handle that

[22:28] jesusabdullah: isaacs: Yeah, after reading your article, the only conclusion is that the concept is innately flawed
[22:28] jesusabdullah: Sometimes I think bytecode would be a good idea, but then I remember how much people hate java
[22:28] dreamdust: I think comparing languages like this to begin with is just apples to oranges. It never really seems to make sense to draw metaphors using programming languages.
[22:28] jesusabdullah: ;)
[22:29] StanlySoManly: dreamdust: here's an example that i hope better explains what i'm trying to do. it's simplified, so it doesn't answer the "why" very well.  http://pastebin.com/19DjvUZD
[22:29] isaacs: jesusabdullah: well, "all" that someone would have to do is write a to-js language that is an order of magnitude more expressive
[22:29] jesusabdullah: Well, drawing metaphors and making analogies is very powerful
[22:29] isaacs: jesusabdullah: that would make it worthwhile to add the tooling and whatnot that makes C so great.
[22:29] jesusabdullah: The problem is that most metaphors break down pretty quick
[22:29] isaacs: jesusabdullah: the proper metaphor really is C++ to C
[22:29] jesusabdullah: Coffeescript is totally js's c++ in a lot of ways
[22:29] tjholowaychuk: i'll take c over c++ any day
[22:30] jesusabdullah: s/a lot/some amusing/

[23:06] bnoordhuis: TheDahv: no, but i get a lot of people asking me if node is "enterprise ready"
[23:07] softdrink: basically i've got an EventEmitter subclass that fires an arbitrary event, and i want to make sure that event is fired appropriately… i'm not sure how to write the vow for it
[23:07] softdrink: 'cause it's not going to emit 'success'...
[23:07] levi501d has joined the channel
[23:07] TheDahv: bnoordhuis: interesting
[23:07] CoverSlide: enterprise people who want only enterprise ready stuff should uninstall java from their servers
[23:07] jesusabdullah: softdrink: I'd use a .on() with a callback
[23:07] jesusabdullah: what's that, this.callback?
[23:08] bnoordhuis: TheDahv: my canned reply is "i can give you a 50K annual support contract without actually giving support, would that help?"

[23:08] nuck: haha for a simple "The variable {foo} is set to {bar}", my script won by a HUGE margin
[23:08] TheDahv: The whole auth thing still prevents me from building things people would put their information into

[23:09] TheDahv: Personally, I really enjoy making quick sites with express. I actually prefer javascript to ruby
[23:09] bnoordhuis: TheDahv: what auth thing?

[23:09] TheDahv: But, I guess a lot of people feel weird about that

[23:09] schwab_ has joined the channel
[23:09] TheDahv: Um, that I don't know a really solid, convincing auth pattern that is generally accepted as "good"
[23:10] softdrink: jesusabdullah:  do you have a good example? the vows docs just sort of brush by it
[23:10] CoverSlide: if you want uber-fast, just code in c
[23:10] tjholowaychuk: nuck compilation time is irrelevant
[23:10] jesusabdullah: softdrink: unfortunately, not really
[23:10] nuck: That's tj's EJS vs. Janl's mustache JS vs. my own script
[23:10] TheDahv: For example, I'm rebuilding http://seattle.beerandcode.org and I decided to use node/express
[23:10] jesusabdullah: If Dominic was here I'd try pinging him. He's a smart guy, knows a lot about testing, really smart about that sort of thing
[23:10] nuck: tjholowaychuk » I just did it for the global, I'll add a testcase for that?
[23:10] jesusabdullah: AND uses vows a lot
[23:11] TheDahv: and I'm building up profiles people can create...I'm kind of in a holding pattern until I decide how I want people to log in to see their stuff
[23:11] tjholowaychuk: nuck (not saying ejs will execute faster either due to with(){}) but yea
[23:11] tjholowaychuk: compile-time doesnt matter
[23:11] bronson: TheDahv, agreed.  All auth libs that I know of are massive overkill.
[23:11] bronson: I'd like to see one that underkills like Node.
[23:11] TheDahv: There is actually not much stuff going on in Seattle with regards to Node.js. I thought this would be a cool chance to maybe generate some excitement

[23:12] secoif has joined the channel
[23:12] nuck: tjholowaychuk » Added a precompiled EJS
[23:12] nuck: Okay, precompiled EJS is definitely the best

[23:12] tbranyen: oh jerrysv nuck i did wiimote stuff in node
[23:13] jerrysv: tbranyen: sorry, was away - node and wii controller
[23:13] SubStack: bnoordhuis: multipart uploads with Expect: 100-continue

[23:14] tjholowaychuk: haha
[23:14] tbranyen: Nexxy: it worked really well with websockets to make a shooter
[23:14] tbranyen: i should finish that demo some day
[23:14] tjholowaychuk: anything with a more restricted syntax can be faster than ejs
[23:14] nuck: If I can split on a Regex, I can make it compile.
[23:14] tjholowaychuk: mustache *should* be much faster
[23:14] Nexxy: tbranyen, that sounds awesome :)
[23:14] nuck: tjholowaychuk » True, but EJS *does* compile to pure JS.
[23:14] tjholowaychuk: and by much, i mean not enough to really care
[23:14] jmoyers has joined the channel
[23:14] nuck: So it makes sense it'd be fast
[23:14] tjholowaychuk: yeah but we also use with(){} to expose locals
[23:14] tjholowaychuk: mustache etc dont need to
[23:15] tbranyen: combyne doesn't need to either 
[23:15] tbranyen: :3
[23:15] nuck: tjholowaychuk » is with slow?  I thought it was just bad practice?
[23:15] tjholowaychuk: both
[23:15] tjholowaychuk: it's great for templates
[23:15] CoverSlide: with is slow
[23:15] tjholowaychuk: haha
[23:15] tjholowaychuk: but that's about it
[23:15] CoverSlide: it's gotta check each variable
[23:16] nuck: ah
[23:16] tjholowaychuk: reality is if you render something enough to warrant a "faster" template engine
[23:16] tjholowaychuk: dont use a template engine
[23:16] nuck: haha true
[23:16] CoverSlide: tjholowaychuk: ever thought of trying to remove the `with`
[23:16] CoverSlide: ?
[23:16] tjholowaychuk: not for ejs but jade has a self: true option
[23:16] nuck: I jsut had an idea for how to make my Parse.js better, and now I wanna see if that's possible
[23:16] tjholowaychuk: to reference self instead
[23:17] tjholowaychuk: looks stupid
[23:17] tjholowaychuk: but hey
[23:17] SubStack: bnoordhuis: when you do a multipart HTTP PUT upload with curl -T "{a,b}.txt" I can only seem to get the contents of a.txt

[23:21] CoverSlide: multipart PUT fails, but multipart POST is ok?
[23:21] nuck: There's no such thing as "fast enough"
[23:21] maushu: That is kind of weird.

[23:37] DrMcKay: AvianFlu: Ruby itself isn't *that* bad, but still, node.js > Python > C > Ruby. put Perl somewhere in there.
[23:38] Daegalus: for me its Node.js > C# > Python > Java > PHP (is this even considered a language?

[23:45] DrMcKay: maxogden: there is a Git implementation in JS
[23:45] addroid-brian: http://www.giantflyingsaucer.com/blog/?p=1688

[23:47] TheDahv: I read this: Note: You need to sudo the sh, not the curl. Fetching stuff from the internet typically doesn't require elevated permissions. Running it might.
[23:47] TheDahv: But I haven't installed in a while
[23:47] nuck: Can somebody explain to me why the fuck Model.save()'s callback isn't being called for me?
[23:47] maxogden: DrMcKay: ooh cool
[23:47] mil_: ?
[23:47] nuck: (note: I'm using Mongoose)
[23:47] TheDahv: mil_: I'm out of practice, but I did as well
[23:47] mil_: you are doing it wrong
[23:48] mil_: k i have what should be a fairly simple question
[23:48] boaz: why should I not, or why should I use homebrew to manage my node.js
[23:48] boaz: (on mac osx lion)
[23:49] nuck: I have a better question: Why is Mongoose so shittily documented?
[23:49] DrMcKay: maxogden: but generally, how does that idea sound?
[23:49] maxogden: boaz: git clone joyent/node is sooooo easy, no need for homebro
[23:49] addroid-brian: TheDahv: Still just hangs
[23:49] mil_: how do you cancel a save from inside the middleware
[23:49] DrMcKay: nuck: it isn't, Cradle is way worse
[23:49] mil_: like
[23:49] mil_: Schema.pre('save', function (next) {   function () { // cancel save })
[23:49] boaz: but homebro helps me keep track of everything, maxogden 
[23:49] DrMcKay: mil_: don't call next
[23:49] maxogden: DrMcKay: its be cool to hvae better node and git hooks. doing pull request tests would be neat if it posted it back to IRC or twitter or something
[23:49] Nexxy: homebro, ilol'd
[23:50] DrMcKay: DID SOMEONE SAY HOOKS?

[23:53] boaz: maxogden: any down side to using homebro other than the fact that compiling on my own is so easy iyho?
[23:53] AvianFlu: DrMcKay, just set up a post-receive hook that sends valid JSON-RPC to hook.io-couch
[23:53] Nexxy has left the channel
[23:53] AvianFlu: make a POST or whatever
[23:53] devaholic: nuck: iirc it does
[23:53] nuck: AvianFlu » Make me a setup for forever

[23:55] DrMcKay: nuck: but you need a non-bare repo anyway
[23:56] DrMcKay: nuck: set up a non-bare repo and add a bare repo as a remote. write a post-receive that cds into non-bare repo and pulls from bare one. then restart your forever daemons from cli
[23:57] dreamdust: You can write a node script to do it with fs.watchFile
