[05:48] davidbanham: I'm trying to emit an event with a variable name, but it never seems to be matched. Is there something obviously wrong with: server.emit(clientId64); ?
[05:49] SubStack: davidbanham: are you sure you're listening for the right name with .on()?
[05:50] davidbanham: If I replace it with server.emit('76561198030707283'); it works like a champion, and I know that the content of clientId64 is 76561198030707283 because I'm console.logging it.
[05:50] SubStack: why not server.emit('id', clientId64) and then server.on('id', function (id) { /* ... */ }) ?
[05:50] SubStack: davidbanham: try server.emit(clientId64.toString())
[05:51] davidbanham: Because, rightly or wrongly, I intend on having many (probably thousands) of listeners on the server object at any one time. In my mind, calling each listener every time and having them evaluate an argument seems like it would blow up.
[05:51] davidbanham: SubStack: Yep, I tried toString, didn't help unfortunately.

[06:32] chjj: the `exports` property, you can replace the entire default object that sits there

[08:10] pigmej: what's currently the best solution to make multiprocess node.js ?
[08:10] riven has joined the channel
[08:10] samyak: pigmej,  what are the purposes ?
[08:10] aurojit: pigmej: what do you mean by multiprocess node.js?
[08:11] pigmej: i have a strong multicore machine
[08:11] pigmej: so it would be nice to be able to use those cores:)
[08:11] pigmej: without 3rd party server at front
[08:11] pigmej: ;-)
[08:13] `3rdEden: just start mulple node processes
[08:13] aurojit: sure but what are you using the cores for
[08:13] aurojit: if it is just to serve different requests
[08:13] Marak: pigmej: use cluster for httpServer
[08:14] aurojit: marak's answer is a decent one
[08:14] pigmej: aurojit: mostly i want to get more requests for one server ;-)
[08:15] aurojit: ok
[08:15] pigmej: without 3rd party server at front:)
[08:15] aurojit: use cluster as marak says

[09:01] chjj: thats what i passed
[09:01] DelvarWorld: that's why I asked about "Number"
[09:01] DelvarWorld: ok
[09:01] chjj: that is a Number
[09:02] DelvarWorld: wouldn't that be a primitive, or maybe int
[09:02] DelvarWorld: a "Number" would be var a = Number(3)
[09:03] chjj: var a = 5; -- that is the literal notation for a Number
[09:03] DelvarWorld: big N Number is a confusing way to say it in this case because big N Number implies the object
[09:03] mehlah has joined the channel
[09:04] chjj: by the way Number(3) doesnt create an 'object' in the typeof sense i dont think, it has to be invoked with the `new` operator to do that

[09:05] chjj: v8: typeof Number(3)

[09:05] chjj: v8: typeof new Number(3)

[10:26] pigmej: exports exports it to use in other 'files'
[10:26] dall: pigmej, ok
[10:26] dall: i have ths "structure"
[10:26] samyak: anybody to tell me which framework to use for testing ?
[10:26] dall:  /index.js        /lib/index.js      /lib/server.js
[10:27] dall: i have put another index.js inside /lib/
[10:27] dall: because if i would like to have more then one .js file inside the /lib
[10:27] dall: i could "index" them with this file
[10:27] neaf: samyak, no good answer here.  if you're going after something to aid with BDD, that'd be vows.
[10:27] dall: in the first index.js i put  ---->   module.exports = require('./lib');
[10:28] pigmej: dall: why ?
[10:28] pigmej: it's a bit 'stupid'
[10:28] neaf: They don't work for me though because of no good async support. (you can exec async code only in topics)
[10:28] samyak: neaf, how about nodeunit ?
[10:28] dall: pigmej because i have read that i have to use an index.js file
[10:28] dall: also socket.io has the same...
[10:29] pigmej: ok but module.exports = require('./lib');
[10:29] pigmej: generally you should read about require()
[10:29] samyak: neaf, it seems they have support for async code
[10:29] pigmej: and exports:)
[10:29] neaf: samyak: One test per file would be pita for me. If I wanted to test each of 10 methods of one class I'd have to create 10 files.
[10:29] dall: https://github.com/learnboost/socket.io
[10:29] dall: ops wrong
[10:29] dall: https://github.com/learnboost/socket.io-node
[10:30] dall: module.exports = require('./lib/socket.io');   <---- is not the same?
[10:30] neaf: samyak, yes, if you are strictly following their 'way' to test.
[10:30] dall: i only put /lib   because i don't have another directory inside it
[10:30] pigmej: dall: ok but everything 'depends'
[10:30] pigmej: so if youre talking about packages ok
[10:30] pigmej: it's ok
[10:30] herbySk has joined the channel
[10:30] dall: i would like to know the good manner to organize my scrips
[10:30] neaf: which is usage of topics in each test.
[10:32] samyak: neaf, k
[10:32] dall: pigmej, how cna i import another js file inside node.js script ? is not require() required :-)
[10:32] eldios has joined the channel
[10:32] neaf: samyak, didn't work out for me, let's say I have addEvent() method on my class, and I want to test if it adds something to variable and returns something, I have to create two topics for one action, one: MyClass.addEvent() and then assert(myClass.events.include, something), and then topic: MyClass, and test like: assert.equal(MyClass.addEvent(), 'somethng')
[10:32] pigmej: var something = require('something');
[10:33] neaf: samyak, expresso is almost perfect, but I can't get it to kill my database connection after finishing all tests.
[10:33] neaf: so I use --serial, and put 'db.disconnect()' 'test' at the bottom of each test series.
[10:33] samyak: neaf, I am using mongodb .. which one you are using?
[10:33] neaf: and it works fine
[10:33] neaf: mongo with mongoose
[10:34] samyak: so you are basically relyingon expresso ?
[10:34] neaf: samyak, yes
[10:34] dall: pigmej, can i not include the .js file and nothing else?
[10:34] pigmej: ?

[10:46] dall: i'm reading the index of the first book i wrote you
[10:46] dall: yes
[10:46] brainproxy: Flanagan's Def Guid really is quite exhaustive as a lan reference

[10:47] brainproxy: it's really important to master the "gotchas" covered on that site
[10:48] dall: "gotchas" ?
[10:48] zhami: dall: be sure to get straight differences between "classical" OOP and Javascripts's prototypal mechanism

[10:52] dall: or http://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-JavaScript-Modern-Introduction-Programming/dp/1593272820
[10:52] dall: the second surelly is good.......but i think the first
[10:52] dall: you?
[10:53] brainproxy: i've been using latest ed. of the Def Guide
[10:53] brainproxy: and had the 5th ed. too
[10:53] brainproxy: i recommend it highly, but the other may be good
[10:53] brainproxy: also, once you've got your feet wet, start drilling on the javascriptgarden.info site
[10:54] brainproxy: and really learn the node.js API well .. read the whole thing a couple of times
[10:54] brainproxy: once you can read the API and know intuitively what those methods do for you, you'll be fine

[10:59] hojberg has joined the channel
[11:00] brainproxy: it's important to learn how prototypal inheritance works, don't skip on that, but if you have a strong desire to do classical OOP in a single inheritance pattern, Joose is your friend
[11:00] dall: brainproxy, ok
[11:01] micheil has joined the channel

[11:02] brainproxy: Shinuza: in what sense do you find it obscure, just curious?
[11:02] Shinuza: it's very different from what you'd do in native javascript
[11:02] Shinuza: the concept is interesting tho
[11:02] meso_ has joined the channel
[11:02] brainproxy: fair enough; it favors classical concepts like "isa", "has" ...
[11:02] Shinuza: but there's a lot of magic in it as well
[11:03] Mrfloyd has joined the channel
[11:03] brainproxy: but you can get orthogonal inheritance patterns too with "does"
[11:03] Shinuza: not sure you'd like this when you start to learn a language
[11:03] brainproxy: yeah, for some folks it could confuse the issue
[11:03] zhami: "Javascript Patterns" book by Stefanov has very good coverage of various inheritance patterns, including both classical and prototypal
[11:04] Shinuza: In my opinion, if you have basic knowledge of inheritance in any other language, you should first see Douglas' talks
[11:05] Shinuza: then move on to something that will abstract this for you
[11:05] Shinuza: and ditch any attempt to implement or use properties visibility

[11:10] Shinuza: it's not meant to store a lot of things

[13:16] swaj: I heard some talk last week though that 0.5.0 really wasn't ready for testing yet
[13:16] swaj: which is why I said it wasn't recommended atm
[13:17] swaj: I tend to stick with the stable builds myself.

[13:24] brainproxy: dall, nvm is a helpful tool, not sure if you've tried it
[13:24] dall: nvm hmm, no...what is?
[13:25] brainproxy: https://github.com/creationix/nvm
[13:25] brainproxy: it compiles and installs node, and npm, for you
[13:25] dall: i have installed node........... now i should install NPM
[13:25] dall: really?
[13:25] dall: wow
[13:25] brainproxy: yep
[13:26] jetienne: dall: do you 
[13:26] jetienne: dall: if you run ubuntu, you can simply do "sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jerome-etienne/neoip && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nodejs"
[13:26] davemo has joined the channel
[13:26] Lorentz: gf3: Just implemented pizza timer on my bot
[13:26] mikegerwitz: dall: npm isn't necessary to use node, if that's what you're asking. It's just like aptitude for node modules.
[13:26] Lorentz: Oh man, hotloading is awesome
[13:27] Misao-chan has joined the channel
[13:27] mhauri has joined the channel
[13:27] dall: hmm one moment guys
[13:27] dall: a bit confused....i would like to use node with socket.io
[13:27] dall: i tried to search socket.io using apt-get
[13:27] dall: but i didn't find it
[13:27] `3rdEden: you need to use the node package manager for that
[13:27] ryah: dall: npm install socket.io
[13:27] dall: so NPM i think is mandatory no?
[13:28] quijote has joined the channel
[13:28] dall: ryah, yes i done it
[13:28] brainproxy: dall: not strictly mandatory
[13:28] `3rdEden: it's not a mandatory
[13:28] brainproxy: but it makes life easier
[13:28] `3rdEden: you can also download the code from github for example
[13:28] davidbanham: dall: You could also install socket.io from source if you wanted, it's just a pain.
[13:28] dall: hmm ok...
[13:28] mbrevoor_ has joined the channel
[13:28] dall: but...so now.....amput NVM
[13:29] bnoordhuis: hah, don't overload him with information, guys
[13:29] dall: if i install it....it will install node and npm
[13:29] bbttxu has joined the channel
[13:29] brainproxy: yes, nvm is a way to do it in one fell swoop
[13:29] brainproxy: the instructions in the github repo for nvm are accurate and easy, if you're using linux
[13:29] dall: ook, so if i install NVM it will install node and NPM and the i will use NPM to add new modules...right ?
[13:30] dall: or do i have to use nvm to install new modules ?
[13:30] brainproxy: nope, just install node v0.4.8
[13:30] brainproxy: w/ nvm
[13:30] brainproxy: then install whatever modules with npm

[13:31] dall: ok
[13:32] mikegerwitz: brainproxy: he had already installed node
[13:32] dall: so now NPM...
[13:32] dall: yes already installed

[13:32] dall: 0.5.0 (btw not important...it's local)

[13:32] mikegerwitz: dall: http://npmjs.org/ if you just want a quick install
[13:32] mikegerwitz: brainproxy: ah alright
[13:33] dall: curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh     where? on the node directory....or outside?

[13:38] dall: jetienne, no i want to learn how to install also :-D before i was using  windows 7.....so i change the OS few days ago
[13:39] d0k has joined the channel
[13:39] d0k_ has joined the channel
[13:39] jetienne: dall: so apt is the normal way to install on ubuntu
[13:39] davidbanham: dall: Configuring it with that prefix means it's only available to you on the system. Leaving it off means it's available to all users, but you need to use root access to install it.
[13:39] d0k has joined the channel
[13:39] brainproxy: I think I should do a "install node in 5 min" screencast

[13:39] brainproxy: featuring my hero, nvm :)
[13:40] jetienne: i should do a install node in 10sec :)
[13:40] jetienne: featuring apt :)
[13:40] brainproxy: hehe
[13:40] davidbanham: Also, don't feel like apt is always the lesser option. It's part of what makes Ubuntu/Debian/*nix easier to use than Windows.
[13:40] dall: jetienne, yes i know...i tried with apt-get also but there is not NPM on apt repositories...right ?
[13:40] jetienne: dall: true, but i rarely use it. i prefere nmod
[13:41] dall: is nmod on apt ?
[13:41] jetienne: https://github.com/jeromeetienne/nmod <- but im seriously biased
[13:41] jetienne: dall: nope but it is a single js file, using npm database to install in node_modules. so not too hard ot install
[13:42] jetienne: i could do a npm .deb... but i dont understand npm options
[13:42] dall: k
[13:42] dall: one moment... :-D nmod ---> use ---> npm ----> to install ---> node modules ? :D
[13:42] strmpnk has joined the channel
[13:43] jetienne: yep
[13:43] Shinuza: jetienne: I don't see a -g option
[13:43] jetienne: nmod is compatible but easier to install 
[13:43] dall: i think     --> npm install module
[13:43] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[13:43] dall: is simple...why nmod is good? (curiosity)
[13:43] jetienne: Shinuza: this is on purpose i wrote nmod to avoid global installation, it tends to create conflict between projects
[13:44] jetienne: dall: my goal was easier to install + node_modules only
[13:44] Shinuza: well, sometimes global installation is ok
[13:44] Shinuza: for tools mainly
[13:44] eyesUnclouded has joined the channel
[13:44] Shinuza: like uglifyjs and the likes
[13:44] dall: k
[13:44] jetienne: Shinuza: i havnt yet seen such a case tho
[13:44] Shinuza: otherwise I totally agree with installing packages "locally"
[13:44] jetienne: Shinuza: but i agree if the tools are stable, global install is ok
[13:45] dall: btw i'm tring npm........i just installed it 
[13:45] Shinuza: although one could install packages in a folder in the path
[13:45] dall: and installed socket.io
[13:45] dall: /usr/local/lib/node_modules      <----- all here
[13:45] dall: wow!
[13:45] stepheneb has joined the channel
[13:46] Shinuza: dall: not recommended
[13:46] dall: ?
[13:46] Shinuza: you should keep your modules in the same folder as your project
[13:46] Shinuza: that way you keep a strong hand on your dependencies
[13:47] Shinuza: so you won't end up deploying a project with an incorrect set of dependencies 
[13:47] sharkbone: I have built a socket reader server for game play clients and will need advises on how to add a game simulator to this . The game server was built with socket.io and node.js any thoughts?
[13:47] Shinuza: dall: have you ever use python?
[13:47] jetienne: btw anybody with an example of mongoose model methods ? 
[13:48] dall: Shinuza, yes
[13:48] Shinuza: you know virtualenv then
[13:48] dall: y
[13:48] dall: ok
[13:49] Shinuza: it's the reverse of what npm does :)
[13:50] dall: ok
[13:50] dall: i will remove npm

[13:50] dall: ahahaha
[13:50] Shinuza: wait what
[13:52] jtsnow has joined the channel

[13:53] sharkbone: I have built a socket reader server for game play clients and will need advises on how to add a game simulator to this . The game server was built with socket.io and node.js any thoughts?
[13:53] neaf: dall, it's better to install the modules in your project directory using npm.
[13:53] neaf: dall, package.json + npm install I suppose
[13:54] ceej has joined the channel
[13:54] Shinuza: dall: npm does that for you
[13:54] jetienne: neaf: hehe excelent

[13:54] jetienne: neaf: i was trying the schema.methods stuff for 30 min :)

[13:56] dall: guys i'm going to be crazy........... i do a little recap
[13:56] dall: we have NODE............................ok.......installed
[13:56] dall: then
[13:56] dall: NPM.....................ok.................installed
[13:56] dall: then example we have a project /home/dall/job/app
[13:56] dall: here i have to put a package.json and put all the dependances
[13:56] dall: AND
[13:57] dall: i have to install these dep INSIDE the project
[13:57] dall: not globally
[13:57] dall: right?
[13:57] dall: correct? any advices? :-D
[13:57] neaf: jetienne, hmm, Didn't know there's some special functionality for methods for mongoose models. It might be the case that my methods won't work with pre/after filters (haven't checked it yet)
[13:57] neaf: dall
[13:58] neaf: dall, that's right, when you get your package.json you just use 'npm install'
[13:58] neaf: without specific module argument
[13:58] dall: neaf without spcific argument....it will install in /usr/lcaol/lib/node_modules
[13:59] neaf: dall, I strongly believe that when using package.json it will install all dependencies to the project dir.
[13:59] korfo has joined the channel
[14:00] dall: i put package.json on the project dir
[14:00] jetienne: neaf: yep i guess this is why mongoose provide those static/methods feature i guess
[14:00] jetienne: i guessed twice... so im not sure :)
[14:00] dall: neaf..... only "npm install" ?

[14:04] dan_manges has joined the channel
[14:04] dall: how npm can know the dependances of my application ?
[14:04] neaf: dall, it doesn't matter where npm itself is installed.
[14:04] neaf: dall, they are in package.json
[14:04] tbranyen: thats a file you need to manually craft
[14:05] dall: ok in package.json i have  a list

[14:06] Shinuza: meh, that's weird
[14:06] Shinuza: shouldn't installed globally as of version 1.0
[14:07] neaf: dall, yes you have to run 'npm install' from the directory where package.json is placed

[15:02] Venom_X has joined the channel
[15:03] Ralle: bnoordhuis: Am i right in my assumption that all such functions that can block on IO are implemented in nodejs directly and require a callback?

[15:03] syskk: yep
[15:04] zmbmartin: syskk: I don't see it in the headers

[15:18] tjholowaychuk: very boring
[15:19] neaf: tjholowaychuk, I tried everything there is for node. expresso is the closest to being perfect. If only it was based on done() in async tests…
[15:20] neaf: that gives much control but without limitations on async testing
[15:20] tjholowaychuk: neaf i had a rewrite started since it's just a quick messy hack right now

[15:21] neaf: uncomfortable*
[15:22] tjholowaychuk: nah it's just the test frameworks that bug me
[15:22] tjholowaychuk: even template engines are more interesting, and people shit those out like no tomorrow
[15:22] Nexxy: neaf, keep in mind that tjholowaychuk is available any time to answer any and all of your questions in regards to his libraries.
[15:22] drudge: don't get me started on tjholowaychuk
[15:22] Nexxy: I hope that helps you feel confident in your choice!
[15:22] neaf: the thing is… I have no idea how can you support all of these releases
[15:23] tjholowaychuk: i just try not to open-source something unless it's reasonably solid, so I have less maintinance
[15:23] neaf: tjholowaychuk, fair enough

[15:25] neaf: It's not that I'm afraid of using your code… it's a combination of admiration and doubt.
[15:25] tjholowaychuk: you take that gamble with any OS project
[15:25] CoverSlide: linus' law
[15:25] tjholowaychuk: what if the redis guy gets bored and wants to work on something else
[15:25] tjholowaychuk: well then you have to learn the lib better
[15:25] tjholowaychuk: and work on it yourself
[15:25] b_erb has left the channel
[15:25] tbranyen: lol i have no admiration and incredible doubt with most proprietary code projects
[15:25] drudge: but being lazy is fun
[15:25] CoverSlide: just add a shitload of people to your project and turn off your email for a few months
[15:26] tjholowaychuk: I'm just not looking forward to going on holidays for a week or two lol 40+ notifications a day, it's going to be hell
[15:27] neaf: tjholowaychuk, here's a good aspect of having no time for OS.
[15:27] tjholowaychuk: totally haha
[15:28] neaf: but working on projects for clients only sucks bad.
[15:28] baudehlo1: so here's a question - how do you deal with totally basic questions about your projects, that show a complete lack of understanding of what they're even about? (like say it was express - it would be a question about how to put lines into paragraphs in your output or something).

[15:30] tjholowaychuk: it's really helpful

[15:31] baudehlo: what do you use for mailing list? I have ezmlm installed on sergeant.org - but I'm hesitant to use it - I kinda prefer outsourcing these days.
[15:31] tjholowaychuk: google :s
[15:32] tjholowaychuk: unfortunately
[15:32] baudehlo: yeah.
[15:32] baudehlo: there's no good free options left for mailing list hosting.
[15:32] baudehlo: ACTION was thinking of writing one.
[15:32] tjholowaychuk: what about zeds?

[16:10] hojberg has joined the channel
[16:10] tjholowaychuk: slickplaid you could do app.get('/:path(*)'
[16:11] lukstr: slickplaid: I would probably use nginx :P
[16:11] tjholowaychuk: and just check req.params.path if it has the trailing /
[16:11] saschagehlich has joined the channel
[16:11] tjholowaychuk: or as regular middleware
[16:11] harth has joined the channel
[16:11] tjholowaychuk: lukstr nginx??
[16:11] slickplaid: so :path(*) will catch multiple whatever/here/there/goes/ in the params?
[16:11] tjholowaychuk: for a redirect? that's a little overkill
[16:11] lukstr: tjholowaychuk: Is there a recommended way to setup an express app where the root path isn't / but something like /somewebapp/blah/ ?
[16:11] slickplaid: nginx as a proxy is fail :D
[16:11] tjholowaychuk: slickplaid yup
[16:11] tjholowaychuk: :foo() just names it
[16:11] tjholowaychuk: otherwise it's req.params[0]
[16:12] gsmcwhirter: is there something like "onuse" for an express app that will run after the app is mounted via a "use" call?
[16:12] lukstr: tjholowaychuk: :)
[16:12] patcoll has joined the channel
[16:13] tjholowaychuk: lukstr you could do connect().use('/whatever', app).listen()
[16:13] tjholowaychuk: at that point the app basically becomes a middleware
[16:13] tjholowaychuk: at that mount-point
[16:13] tjholowaychuk: so GET /whatever/user/1 will look like GET /user/1 to the app itself
[16:13] lukstr: ah okay I didn't know you could do that

[16:14] tjholowaychuk: lukstr or alternatively
[16:14] tjholowaychuk: app.use('/mount-point/here', app.router)
[16:15] tjholowaychuk: all other middleware would see /mount-point/here, but the routes themselves would not
[16:15] gsmcwhirter: tjholowaychuk, thanks. i have nested mounts, and redirects on the innermost ones don't currently work right. going to try to set the routes after the "use" has been called
[16:15] tjholowaychuk: gsmcwhirter res.redirect() ?
[16:16] gsmcwhirter: tjholowaychuk, yeah. 
[16:16] tjholowaychuk: hmm\
[16:16] lukstr: tjholowaychuk: is that in the connect/express documentation anywhere?
[16:16] tjholowaychuk: lukstr not sure to be honest, maybe not
[16:16] gsmcwhirter: i think the issue is the order that the .use mounting is happening
[16:16] lukstr: tjholowaychuk: it was very unobvious to me, I may be missing something though
[16:16] jgv has joined the channel
[16:16] slickplaid: I don't see any examples in the expressjs.com docs for the :path(whatgoeshere) ... any explaination? Is it just a wildcard match? Oooh... nevermind it's in there

[16:17] tjholowaychuk: and has been for ages but the documentation blows
[16:17] CoverSlide: seriously
[16:17] tjholowaychuk: slickplaid just a named capture group

[18:21] djcoin has joined the channel
[18:21] baudehlo: consider more how much traffic you're pushing to each and how often, not the number of connections.
[18:21] baudehlo: epoll can easily handle about 300k+ idle concurrent connections.
[18:22] raZer: How many are you expecting? I wanted around 500 which worked well with node with database activity and some processing

[18:25] eyesUnclouded has joined the channel
[18:26] mjr_: Tidwell: a single node process CAN hold open pretty large numbers of connections.  However, if you want to service those connections with low latency, you'll probably want some more processes.
[18:26] mjr_: If you don't care as much about latency, then perhaps it is fine.
[18:27] kohai: @mrryanjohnston: The most important thing I've realized about node.js is that I have to completely forget about understanding why procedural code won't work

[18:28] isaacs: sh1mmer: c-ares does

[18:30] Tidwell: mjr_: yea, i'm using forever to restart it, and if there is minimal data loss due to crash, its not too important - have to wait and see i guess - but the fact that it *can* support a metric-shit-ton-load of connections takes a bit of worry off me...

[18:30] hij1nx: isaacs: re npm: am i doing something wrong with my npm auth? it says im not authed, but i can publish, and i see my changes pub'd
[18:30] sh1mmer: tbranyen: so that's an actual issue then?
[18:30] zmbmartin: tjholowaychuk: in this example https://gist.github.com/1010780 can have the requireLogin middleware only when it is not req.accepts('json')?
[18:31] isaacs: hij1nx: update to 1.0.10
[18:31] Tidwell: slickplaid: ooo no, have to check that out!
[18:31] isaacs: hij1nx: that's fixed.
[18:31] isaacs: hij1nx: you may need to `npm adduser` again
[18:31] isaacs: (just use the same un/pw/email)
[18:31] pkrumins: It worked
[18:31] isaacs: sweet
[18:31] mjr_: Tidwell: it can.  At some point, you'll need to consider how you'll add more processes, but one node process gets you a long way in most cases.
[18:31] tjholowaychuk: zmbmartin: what?
[18:31] tbranyen: sh1mmer: i recall seeing it recently yeah
[18:31] hij1nx: isaacs: ah excellent!!
[18:32] tjholowaychuk: you could add that to the middleware
[18:32] sh1mmer: tbranyen: thanks
[18:32] pkrumins: isaacs: what is this about "npm WARN prefer global npm@1.0.10 should be installed with -g"
[18:32] pkrumins: getting this now after upgrade
[18:32] isaacs: pkrumins: how are you installing npm?
[18:32] Tidwell: mjr_: yea, it'll be my first deployment of a non-trivial node app with decent traffic, so I'm just trying to cover my bases before I get a middle-of-the-night call from some random exec
[18:32] pkrumins: isaacs: i just ran the `curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh`
[18:32] tjholowaychuk: or you could have a middleware that checks for Accept: with json, if present allow the route, otherwise next('route')
[18:32] tjholowaychuk: for the html one
[18:33] hij1nx: isaacs: works now!! you're killin it man ;)
[18:33] zmbmartin: tjholowaychuk: ok
[18:33] isaacs: pkrumins: um... that's odd, then?
[18:33] isaacs: pkrumins: that would imply that it's trying to install it into ./node_modules instead of globally
[18:34] isaacs: pkrumins: but the make script explicitly sets --force
[18:34] isaacs: pkrumins: er, --global
[18:34] pkrumins: that's actualy what i need

[18:50] level09_: or I dont know how to 
[18:50] level09_: :)
[18:50] `3rdEden: level09_ use socket.io
[18:50] level09_: I'm using socket.io
[18:50] level09_: here is the scenario
[18:50] hunterloftis: level09: If you use an abstraciton library (like socket.io) it will automatically fallback
[18:50] isaacs: rpj8: or just load the same template, and read the defaults off the post body
[18:50] tjholowaychuk: rpj8 nah sessions are a really trivial way to share that sort of state
[18:51] level09_: I'm trying , but still missing something
[18:51] tjholowaychuk: yeah you dont necessarily need to redirect
[18:51] level09_: here is my scenario
[18:51] level09_: craete the connection
[18:51] rpj8: hm
[18:51] rpj8: alright.
[18:51] tjholowaychuk: many options :D
[18:51] rpj8: haha yes.
[18:51] level09_: and i want to push a message on connection
[18:51] rpj8: so hard to chose which is best >>
[18:52] level09_: problem is, if websocket fails, the on('connection') fails

[18:53] `3rdEden: level09_ do you have all transports enabled?
[18:53] level09_: I dont know, how do I check ?
[18:53] `3rdEden: as it should fallback to flashsocket, than xhr-polling
[18:53] level09_: I think it falls back to xhr-multipart
[18:53] rpj8: what i'm doing currently is havea  /login template, which posts to a /register, which uses middleware to see if the name is already taken. if it is, it redirects back to the /login page

[19:01] tjholowaychuk: zmbmartin express doesn't touch and html you write to the socket

[19:34] zmbmartin: tjholowaychuk: thanks for the accepts gist that cleaned up what I did quite a bit.
[19:34] alessio_alex: What's the global namespace for Node.js ?
[19:34] alessio_alex: Like window is in the browser...?
[19:35] meat_popsicle: global

[19:36] alessio_alex: I read it was global too, but when I say global.test() for example it gives me an error
[19:36] alessio_alex: where test is defined in the same file :)
[19:36] meat_popsicle: so
[19:37] zmbmartin: rpj8: are you using sessions to keep for fields intact? 
[19:37] meat_popsicle: alex: try this.test()
[19:37] rpj8: zmbmartin: I'm attempting to :P I'm still fumbling around with it currently.
[19:37] mikegerwitz: alessio_alex: Because stuff defined in the file is in the module scope, not global
[19:37] rpj8: zmbmartin: trying to figure out how to dislpay it out ina  conditional in jade currently
[19:37] alessio_alex: oh
[19:37] mikegerwitz: alessio_alex: unless you do `foo = function()`, without the var prefix
[19:38] alessio_alex: can't I call foo with an object before?
[19:38] CoverSlide: coreb: https://github.com/creationix/step
[19:38] meat_popsicle: an easier way to get it on to the global is use a closure
[19:38] gonsfx has joined the channel
[19:38] alessio_alex: the thing is I am using the jQuery aop plugin adapted for node
[19:38] alessio_alex: and I must pass an object
[19:38] meat_popsicle: (function() { /** do you defines in here as this.foo = xxxxxx */ })();
[19:38] alessio_alex: in the browser you could do window.function
[19:39] alessio_alex: that's why I'm searching for something similar to do here
[19:39] mikegerwitz: meat_popsicle: Beware, that will break in strict mode. Whenever v8 gets around to it.
[19:39] meat_popsicle: true
[19:39] meat_popsicle: though strict mode is only ES5
[19:40] mikegerwitz: meat_popsicle: well, so will globals, actually. 
[19:40] CoverSlide: omgwtfbbq!
[19:40] meat_popsicle: technically and all
[19:40] zmbmartin: rpj8: got a gist of your server side code. I haven't messed with sessions to much yet?
[19:40] mikegerwitz: meat_popsicle: unless you do an explicit global.foo
[19:40] meat_popsicle: true
[19:40] CoverSlide: no (function(){})() in strict mode?
[19:40] mikegerwitz: CoverSlide: Closures work fine. But the function won't reference the global scope when using 'this'
[19:40] mikeal has joined the channel

[19:40] aphelion has joined the channel
[19:41] mikegerwitz: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Strict_mode
[19:41] alessio_alex: so if I have the function test() in a file, can I do something.test() ?
[19:41] jmoyers: browser i assume it'd be bind(function(){}, window);
[19:41] rpj8: zmbmartin: basically what i'm doing is this:       req.session.sticky = req.body
[19:41] eyesUnclouded has joined the channel
[19:41] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[19:41] mikegerwitz: The problem was with constructors. If someone would forget the 'new' keyword, then 'this' would reference the global scope and introduce all sorts of problems.
[19:41] rpj8: Then what i'd like to do is redirect to the login page, then fill in the input boxes by passing locals to the view
[19:42] rpj8: zmbmartin: then in the view, conditionally put the `value=' attribute it

[19:43] xeodox has joined the channel
[19:43] alessio_alex: ok
[19:44] alessio_alex: Anyway throwing a function in a global namespace is a bad practice, so it's not that important 
[19:44] mikegerwitz: :) yep
[19:44] meat_popsicle: it's useful though
[19:44] meat_popsicle: for classes etc
[19:44] meat_popsicle: or defining your own namespace
[19:44] jmoyers: v8: !function(){console.log('nom nom nom')}
[19:44] v8bot: jmoyers: false
[19:44] alessio_alex: I have another question
[19:44] alessio_alex: about web workers
[19:45] jmoyers: yeah, but then you end up with a rad YUI like thing
[19:45] jmoyers: YUI.silly
[19:45] mikegerwitz: I don't see namespacing as an antipattern. Any other global, yes
[19:45] meat_popsicle: YUI.awesome.more.less.what.confused();
[19:45] alessio_alex: If I use for example Cluster or something like that, will I get a "copy" of a server 4 times for example
[19:45] alessio_alex: ?
[19:45] jmoyers: ACTION doesn't like namespacing patterns
[19:45] alessio_alex: I mean, I have 4 web workers for a server
[19:45] tjholowaychuk:  alessio_alex essentially yes
[19:45] alessio_alex: hello Tj
[19:46] alessio_alex: So the web workers are something like threads no?
[19:46] alessio_alex: So that a process won't consume the 512 limit of MB?
[19:46] alessio_alex: That's their usefulness?
[19:46] tjholowaychuk: processes
[19:46] rpj8: tjholowaychuk: how could you check for the existance of a local variable in jade? - if (name) comes back and says name is underfined

[19:47] rpj8: or would you not want to do this with jade
[19:47] ip5432 has joined the channel
[19:47] tjholowaychuk: rpj8 it's just js so
[19:47] CoverSlide: processes are heavier than threads

[19:47] tjholowaychuk: rpj8 or if (locals.foo)
[19:47] rpj8: tjholowaychuk: ah, you must have locals.
[19:47] rpj8: i missed the `locals.' bit
[19:47] alessio_alex: So having multiple web workers will help my app scale, using multiple processes and multiple processors no?
[19:47] rpj8: was doing if (name)
[19:48] CoverSlide: it just a matter that you limit the number of processes so you only use what you need on your server

[19:49] context: alessio_alex: ease of management
[19:49] tjholowaychuk: zero-downtime restarts etc
[19:49] tjholowaychuk: lots of features
[19:49] alessio_alex: oh
[19:50] context: tjholowaychuk: cluster intelligently restarts one worker at a time? nice
[19:51] tjholowaychuk: context it spawns a second master, the previous one sticks around until it's workers finish up with remaining connections
[19:51] tjholowaychuk: which is then killed, meanwhile the new master has been accepting with your new code
[19:51] tjholowaychuk: so at times, you will have double the workers
[19:51] alessio_alex: In the cluster example, there is cluster(app), where app is the normal http server from node. Can I use cluster with Express.js too?
[19:51] tjholowaychuk: alessio_alex yes
[19:51] alessio_alex: great
[19:51] tjholowaychuk: you can use cluster with any node http or tcp server
[19:52] tjholowaychuk: or stand-alone for job queues etc

[20:06] samuelkadolph: hydoskee: HTTPS doesn't change the actual HTTP request. An HTTP supports basic auth in the url username:password@host
[20:06] Stephen: the typical approach is to pass the parameter, but it does tend to get messy if you're not careful
[20:06] hydoskee: Stephen: the https I need is to send a POST with a data body and http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.3.7/api/https.html#hTTPS https.request is lacking a spot to put in a user/pass combination as an auth
[20:06] alessio_alex: yup, I'm feeling messy
[20:06] hydoskee: I need something similar to the curl -u interface

[20:07] samuelkadolph: True, the client does it
[20:07] eldar has joined the channel
[20:07] hydoskee: Stephen - haven't seen an example that emulates curl's '-u' parameter - any ideas on that?
[20:07] hydoskee: or what to search for
[20:07] hydoskee: I would settle for "what to search for"
[20:07] bnoordhuis: isaacs: that's only basic auth
[20:08] isaacs: To make such a request in node, parse the url with url.parse(), and then if there's an "auth" member, do headers: { authorization: "Basic " + (new Buffer(auth)).toString("base64") }
[20:08] springify has joined the channel
[20:08] isaacs: bnoordhuis: yeah, but thats' what clients do with http://user:pass@host.com/
[20:08] bnoordhuis: isaacs: no, it depends on the www-authenticate the server returns
[20:09] isaacs: yeah, but isn't that just if the server responds with a 401?
[20:09] samuelkadolph: Yes
[20:09] isaacs: i thought just setting the un/pw in the url sends Basic for the first GET
[20:10] bnoordhuis: that's correct - but it won't work if the server uses e.g. digest
[20:10] isaacs: right
[20:10] cognominal has joined the channel
[20:10] isaacs: so it'll ignore the Authorization: Basic, and kick back a 401, and then you get to dance
[20:10] bnoordhuis: yep - but sending basic auth headers unrequested is a bad idea
[20:10] samuelkadolph: curl -u send basic authentication
[20:11] Stephen: bnoordhuis: Good point
[20:11] isaacs: meh.  if you've got an account on the server, presumably you know how to log into it
[20:11] isaacs: go over https if you can :)
[20:11] samuelkadolph: That's a fairly bad assumption
[20:11] tomtomaso has joined the channel
[20:11] isaacs: haha
[20:11] samuelkadolph: To never send auth without be challeneged
[20:12] coyo|2 has joined the channel
[20:12] Oooska has left the channel
[20:12] isaacs: npm sends basic auth without a challenge.
[20:12] samuelkadolph: Especially over https and especially if you it requires it
[20:12] hydoskee: isaacs: is there an example running around of using https auth in a request in nodejs?  that's exactly what I'm trying to do
[20:12] isaacs: hydoskee: are you the server or the client?
[20:12] hydoskee: I am the client
[20:13] samuelkadolph: combine https.request with the snippet he gave you for base64 encoding
[20:13] context: http basic auth ?
[20:13] EyePulp has joined the channel
[20:13] isaacs: hydoskee: ok, so on the request config object, you can specify headers.  do that.
[20:13] context: or cert auth
[20:13] jetienne: q. with expressjs, is there a way to launch a method *after* each app.get/post/etc... ?
[20:13] hydoskee: isaacs: so I set the authorization in the options?
[20:13] isaacs: hydoskee: https.request({ host, path, etc, headers: { <auth headers go in here> } }
[20:14] Stephen: coo(walrus, coo.apply(cachoo));
[20:14] isaacs: hydoskee: depends on the type of authentication
[20:14] context: jetienne: doesn't express/connect of an event for the end of each conenction
[20:14] isaacs: hydoskee: for basic auth, the header looks like:  authorization: Basic <base64>
[20:14] hydoskee: isaacs: curl wise it's curl -X POST -u "<application key>:<master secret>"
[20:14] zmbmartin: tjholowaychuk: is their a app.env that I can check so when in production I can have different settings from some of my plugins?
[20:14] isaacs: hydoskee: where <base64> is the base64-encoded "username:password"
[20:14] isaacs: hydoskee: yeah, that's basic auth
[20:14] hydoskee: ok, wonderful
[20:14] jetienne: context: i dunno, does it ?
[20:14] hydoskee: thank you
[20:14] tjholowaychuk: zmbmartin yeah read the docs for app.configure
[20:14] bnoordhuis: pedantic correction: curl checks the www-authenticate header
[20:15] tjholowaychuk: jetienne node has events
[20:15] tjholowaychuk: for that sort of thing
[20:15] isaacs: hydoskee: to base64 encode something, you can do: new Buffer(myString).toString("base64")
[20:15] samuelkadolph: bnoordhuis: Only if the server spits back a 401
[20:15] isaacs: hydoskee: note!! that's sent in the clear!!
[20:15] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[20:15] tjholowaychuk: jetienne so you could add a middleware before app.router
[20:15] isaacs: hydoskee: if it's over https, that's fine.
[20:15] level09_ has joined the channel
[20:15] tjholowaychuk: hooking into those events
[20:15] isaacs: hydoskee: or if it's not super secret.
[20:15] hydoskee: not super secret
[20:16] zmbmartin: tjholowaychuk: I tried setting them in app.configure('development' and app.configure('production but development setting were still being used
[20:16] jetienne: tjholowaychuk: before ? i want the function to be called after app.router
[20:16] jetienne: tjholowaychuk: this is to save a dirty object in the database after the request
[20:17] dve: hmm.. im still not quite getting this waiting for aync callbacks thing... my code looks like this https://gist.github.com/1009145
[20:17] dve: any tips?
[20:17] bnoordhuis: isaacs: on a related topic: https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/1083
[20:18] tjholowaychuk: zmbmartin NODE_ENV=production
[20:19] tjholowaychuk: jetienne but if you listen on events, you want the middleware before
[20:19] tjholowaychuk: so it can register them
[20:19] tjholowaychuk: much like logger()
[20:19] walkingeyerobot: dve: I'd like to help, but I don't quite know what coffeescript looks like after it compiles.
[20:19] tjholowaychuk: is typically the first middleware
[20:19] tjholowaychuk: so it can wrap the entire thing
[20:19] tjholowaychuk: for :response-time
[20:19] CoverSlide: process.env as well
[20:19] zmbmartin: tjholowaychuk: sorry I am an idiot. It was something else.
[20:19] zmbmartin: thanks
[20:19] zmbmartin: again
[20:20] zomgbie has joined the channel
[20:20] jetienne: tjholowaychuk: ok i will look at logger
[20:20] tjholowaychuk: jetienne logger actually wraps res.end(), but it could have been done with the "finish" event (I think that's the one)
[20:20] tjholowaychuk: i dont think it's documented
[20:20] tjholowaychuk: or maybe it's not publish
[20:20] tjholowaychuk: public*
[20:20] podman has joined the channel
[20:21] eyesUnclouded has joined the channel
[20:21] isaacs: bnoordhuis: yeah, looks like www-authenticate needs to be added to the list of stackable headers?
[20:21] dve: walkingeyerobot ... converting
[20:21] isaacs: bnoordhuis: is it acceptable to get "WWW-Authenticate: Basic, Digest"?
[20:21] isaacs: bnoordhuis: (ie, is comma-joining ok)
[20:21] rodasc has joined the channel
[20:22] bnoordhuis: isaacs: yes, that would work
[20:23] bnoordhuis: a raw list of header name/value tuples would be even better perhaps
[20:23] isaacs: ok, then that's a pretty straightforward bug.  wanna patch?  i'm not sure off-hand whether it should be in v0.4 or if this counts as "new api"
[20:23] zmbmartin: How do I set NODE_ENV=production with forever?
[20:23] isaacs: yeah, let's not open that door
[20:23] stagas: jetienne: function after(fn) { return function(req, res, next) { var end = res.end; res.end = function() { end.apply(this, arguments); fn() } } }
[20:23] bnoordhuis: isaacs: you did notice that it's a pull request, right? :)
[20:23] isaacs: bnoordhuis: http headers are a weird and ugly data format.
[20:23] isaacs: oh, hah
[20:23] samuelkadolph: isaacs: HTTP rfc says comma split list of methods unless there is more than 1 www-authenticate header then it is comma split list of arugments
[20:23] isaacs: just thought it was an issue :)
[20:23] isaacs: aw, jeez.
[20:23] isaacs: that's fugly
[20:23] stagas: jetienne: use like this: app.get('/foo', after(function() { ... }), function(req, res) { ... })
[20:24] isaacs: so, if there's more than one www-auth header, then commas change meaning.  great.
[20:24] samuelkadolph: Indeed

[20:30] isaacs: walkingeyerobot: heh, "pyramid code", that's cute.
[20:30] dve: walkingeyerobot ... thanks, but I actually want to wait until all the callbacks in the forEach loop are completed
[20:31] dve: not callback each time
[20:31] walkingeyerobot: dve: ah I see
[20:31] tswicegood has joined the channel
[20:31] walkingeyerobot: dve: one way to do this is to figure out how many times the forEach is going to be called before calling it (such as replies.length)
[20:32] walkingeyerobot: dve: then have the forEach callback check to see how many times it's already been called
[20:32] walkingeyerobot: dve: and on the last one, call your callback
[20:32] mikl: any recommendation on what MySQL-library to use with Node? There are countless and its hard to compare :(

PHP is a more traditional object oriented language (has extends, implements, private / public, etc) while javascript is all prototypal inheritence based. Node.js gives you commands to interact with the file system and network streams at a low, non-blocking level. PHP is a collection of loosely related commands with no common naming conventions

[21:06] cl0udy: You use your web browser to make a request for "/about.html" on a Node.js web server.
[21:06] cl0udy: The Node server accepts your request and calls a function to retrieve that file from disk.
[21:06] cl0udy: While the Node server is waiting for the file to be retrieved, it services the next web request.
[21:06] cl0udy: When the file is retrieved, there is a callback function that is inserted in the Node servers queue.
[21:06] cl0udy: The Node server executes that function which in this case would render the "/about.html" page and send it back to your web browser.

[21:06] MooGoo: php isnt a webserver

[21:08] cl0udy: i see
[21:08] MooGoo: so it would be more like
[21:08] cl0udy: pls explain
[21:09] MooGoo: browser sends request to php, php sends IO request for file and waits, another browser request comes in, but PHP does nothing with it, PHP gets file, sends it back to client, then services the next clients request
[21:09] cl0udy: oh ok
[21:09] MooGoo: that is if PHP was acting as the webserver too

[21:09] samuelkadolph: That's not a 1:1 comparison
[21:09] MooGoo: but it could
[21:09] cl0udy: how does node.js prevent this from happening?
[21:10] samuelkadolph: cl0udy: The OS tells node when things are ready
[21:10] MooGoo: nodejs is built using libeio, a C library for async I/O

[21:17] zmbmartin: MooGoo: I want to create from scratch
[21:17] Marak: zmbmartin: from html or postscript?
[21:17] tjholowaychuk: slickplaid yup
[21:17] tjholowaychuk: i plan on adding pdf support to node-canvas
[21:18] slickplaid: tjholowaychuk: Awesome. :)
[21:18] MooGoo: and...TeX is not an easy language to figure out
[21:18] CoverSlide: didnt marak make a pdf module?

[21:18] MooGoo: whatever
[21:18] jerrysv: moogoo: call a spade a spade. language.
[21:18] zmbmartin: Marak: I just want to create pdf's from text and photo from my database. Listing's of houses basically that users will enter info and upload photos. then I want to generate pdf's
[21:19] MooGoo: jerrysv it's pretty ugly whatever it is
[21:19] MooGoo: still it works
[21:19] Marak: CoverSlide: its requires you build it up using post script
[21:19] zmbmartin: tjholowaychuk: when are you adding that to node-cavas?
[21:19] tjholowaychuk: zmbmartin not positive
[21:20] tjholowaychuk: within the next 2 or 3 months I would suspect
[21:20] tjholowaychuk: we have big plans for that feature
[21:20] Marak: zmbmartin: pdf.js will work for basic pdfs, https://github.com/Marak/pdf.js/blob/master/node-demo.js

[21:40] justinw312: Okay, I know it's doing it wrong, not the node way, etc, (and I'm not even planning to do this). But from a theory perspective: is there a generic way to wrap any given non-blocking function to make it block without busy waiting? Is settimeout polling the only option?
[21:40] justinw312: as in I don't want to do it, but I got to thinking how it would be possible
[21:40] SubStack: justinw312: there is no way without using the thread pool

[21:42] tjholowaychuk: zmbmartin yup
[21:42] tjholowaychuk: very easy
[21:42] tjholowaychuk: with the canvas api
[21:42] tjholowaychuk: and flexible, looking forward to it
[21:42] slickplaid: Yeah, it looks pretty sexy and relatively easy to implement.
[21:43] zmbmartin: tjholowaychuk: very easy to add? or will be easy to make pdf's?
[21:43] tjholowaychuk: very easy to build pdfs
[21:43] justinw312: SubStack: Thanks
[21:43] Marak: zmbmartin: the idea is you can take html output and transform it into a pdf document

[22:44] bnoordhuis: jerrysv: typedef void (*free_callback)(char *data, void *hint)
[22:44] jerrysv: aha, so that gets fired when it gets garbage collected away?

[23:07] Marak: kryl: we use node.js in production, there are a few caveats 
[23:08] Determinist has joined the channel
[23:08] jmoyers: kryl as for benchmarks -- front runners are seeing good results i think. google 'http benchmarks nodejs' -- you'll find things like this: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1088699
[23:08] jmoyers: not sure what the latest greatest looks like
[23:09] Determinist: how do you guys run your node servers under unprivileges users while binding to ports lower than 1024?
[23:09] Determinist: i'm having a real argument with my silly admin over this right now
[23:09] bnoordhuis: Determinist: iptables REDIRECT
[23:10] jmoyers: Determinist iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
[23:10] jmoyers: something like that
[23:10] jmoyers: i've got it running like that, anyway
[23:10] kryl: yes for example, or more official forums perhaps ?
[23:10] jmoyers: or you run ngnix in front of it, serve static files off of it, and forward other requests onto node
[23:10] kryl: or any advice from users  here
[23:10] kryl: I found different closure on the net so I'm share between using it or not in production ...
[23:10] igl has joined the channel
[23:10] Determinist: bnoordhuis: all fine and dandy, but what happens when you need to do http callbacks? no way to know in the application what public port it is actually mapped to, especially if internally it is running on a different port
[23:11] Determinist: jmoyers: socket.io doesn't work very well with nginx :)
[23:11] jmoyers: HAproxy?
[23:11] jmoyers: something like that
[23:12] bnoordhuis: Determinist: you can start as root, bind to a privileged port, then drop privileges with setuid() / setgid()
[23:12] jmoyers: what do you mean by 'http callbacks'
[23:12] Determinist: jmoyers: we're using dns round robin with ip addresses instead
[23:12] jmoyers: so a load balancer?
[23:12] jmoyers: so you're talking about session binding?
[23:12] jmoyers: or what?
[23:12] Marak: jmoyers: node-http-proxy supports websocket proxying btw
[23:13] Determinist: jmoyers: yeah, essentially it's a load ballancer using DNS
[23:13] Determinist: nm that, it's not the issue tho
[23:13] jmoyers: Marak yup, have seen it and used it isolated
[23:13] jmoyers: just never wanted to run node as root

[23:13] Determinist: jmoyers: you asked about http callback... lets assume you have some async thing where you call a url and give them as one of the parameters the url to make a request to when it's done doing whatever it is that your request was about
[23:13] kryl: well
[23:14] jmoyers: okay
[23:14] jmoyers: so a postback?
[23:14] jmoyers: server to server?
[23:14] Determinist: lowering priv is fine, cept my admin is throwing a fit over running the node server as root initially

[23:15] swaj: well it has to unless you don't care about running port 80 :P
[23:15] Determinist: it's a web server, what's the point running it on non-standard ports? not to mention proxies and firewalls in the middle
[23:15] jmoyers: you hand off url xx to the server, lets say a post commit hook in hithub for instance, why does it matter what port you are running on?
[23:16] bnoordhuis: Determinist: the external world doesn't care that you run on port 8080, it only sees port 80

[23:16] jmoyers: but
[23:16] swaj: Determinist: run HAProxy or something similar on port 80 and have it direct to your app based on hostname
[23:16] jmoyers: does prerouting in iptables work for originating outbound also?
[23:17] Determinist: his brilliant idea was having 2 configuration options in the server's config file to specify that port node is binding to and what public port is actually available. this sounds silly to me, but he claims this is common and practical.
[23:17] Determinist: sounds dumb to me.
[23:17] Determinist: what do you guys think?
[23:17] jmoyers: as with the postback case, its not a client -> server interaction
[23:17] jmoyers: i dont understand why you need reference to the public port at all
[23:17] MikeMakesIt has joined the channel
[23:17] bnoordhuis: Determinist: configured internal and external addresses? common practice
[23:17] kryl: thank you for "reports" :)
[23:17] Determinist: s/is actually available/the filewall is redirecting from
[23:17] swaj: Determinist: what I've seen most commonly is a proxy (like nginx, HAProxy, varnish) running on port 80 and then delegating to localhost:8000 or whatever each individual app is running on.
[23:18] swaj: Determinist: then your app just runs on 127.0.0.1, with your proxy handling all internet traffic and passing it along to the appropriate backend.
[23:18] jmoyers: thats right swaj, but why cant you get away with just iptables if you are running host specific iptables anyway?
[23:18] jmoyers: at least thats been my experience -- im not sure about posting to another server, originating from that web server, though
[23:18] swaj: jmoyers: you probably could, but it would only work for a single app.  If you're running 20 node apps on that webserver, you need a proxy to check host headers
[23:19] jmoyers: swaj actually
[23:19] jmoyers: i use connect.vhost for that
[23:19] swaj: jmoyers: sure, that would work.. but then connect.vhost is basically a proxy :)
[23:19] jmoyers: i've got 4 different sites running off one clustered express app
[23:19] jmoyers: but i go iptables -> express vhost -> express app
[23:19] MrNibbles: evening gents
[23:20] jmoyers: sup sucka
[23:20] Xano has joined the channel
[23:20] jmoyers: ACTION is 'gangsta'
[23:20] swaj: right so iptables is redirecting port 80 to your connect.vhost, which then proxies to whatever express apps you have running :P
[23:20] jmoyers: yes
[23:20] swaj: same idea
[23:20] jmoyers: well,
[23:20] jmoyers: the nice part is
[23:20] jmoyers: thats 4 lines of code
[23:20] swaj: but instead of needing iptables, you can just run a proxy on port 80 :P
[23:20] jmoyers: thats true
[23:20] jmoyers: they are both totally valid, i would imagine
[23:21] swaj: aye
[23:21] jmoyers: i just didn't want to learn ngnix config shit ;P
[23:21] swaj: all I'm saying is that if your bofh doesn't want node running as root, then use a proxy of some sort :P
[23:21] jmoyers: using ngnix or something has the benefit of server static files like a boss
[23:21] swaj: nginx is a bad idea with websockets... again because of the lack of support for HTTP 1.1/chunked encoding
[23:21] jmoyers: i.. dont run node as root ;-)
[23:21] Determinist: not considering a proxy tho. HA/nginx/whatever. so i guess the public port + private port solution will have to do for now.
[23:22] dguttman_ has joined the channel
[23:22] swaj: Determinist: yeah if he wants to use iptables, let him.  It's no big deal :P
[23:22] jmoyers: Determinist i still don't get how you're going to bind the public port
[23:22] jmoyers: without root, or at least starting at root
[23:22] Determinist: bnoordhuis: btw, i've never seen public + private ports being specified for any server software before
[23:22] jmoyers: Determinist done much apache config?
[23:22] swaj: Determinist: your BOFH has a proxy running on that public IP :P
[23:22] swaj: Determinist: or he's using iptables
[23:22] Determinist: jmoyers: iptables redirects from port 80 to the internally bound node js listening on 8080, for example
[23:22] bnoordhuis: Determinist: do more enterprise programming and you soon will :)
[23:22] Determinist: jmoyers: actually, yeah, i have...
[23:23] jmoyers: Determinist its pretty common to bind to more than one interface
[23:23] jmoyers: in apache
[23:23] jmoyers: or a specific interface
[23:23] jmoyers: we run some java servers
[23:23] jmoyers: and we've got them jailed up too
[23:23] jmoyers: 80 -> 8080
[23:23] Determinist: jmoyers: nooo, i'm talking about port forwarding
[23:23] swaj: Determinist: so your operator sounds like a smart guy.  He knows you don't need a proxy for a single app, and he doesn't want your app binding directly to port 80 because it requires root privs.  Seems like a reasonable compromise.
[23:24] _jdalton has left the channel
[23:24] Determinist: swaj: smart, maybe. not an elegant solution.
[23:24] jmoyers: our main it architect is a symantec badass, and he has a very similar outlook
[23:24] jmoyers: ACTION puts on his tin foil hat
[23:24] swaj: Determinist: I guess I disagree.  it's a single iptables rule.  Pretty elegant, and avoids security issues.
[23:24] jmoyers: swaj++
[23:24] v8bot:  jmoyers has given a beer to swaj. swaj now has 1 beers.
[23:25] Determinist: swaj: yeah, but to the guy configuring the node app's config... how is that guy supposed to know what iptables rules the admin has set up? what about simplifying things?
[23:25] hecticjeff has joined the channel
[23:25] jmoyers: in short, you dont
[23:25] jmoyers: why does your app care?
[23:25] Determinist: postbacks, you called those?
[23:26] jmoyers: yes?
[23:26] Determinist: the app has to know what public port to tell clients to connect to
[23:26] gavin_huang has joined the channel
[23:26] jmoyers: 80!
[23:26] jmoyers: its default for http
[23:26] Determinist: sweet jesus
[23:26] Determinist: i know...
[23:26] jmoyers: ACTION must be thick
[23:27] swaj: Determinist: why does the node guy need to know what public ports are being used?  your operator tells you the private port to use and your node app binds to only that port on 127.0.0.1.  iptables handles the rest.  node guy doesn't need to know or care :/
[23:27] Determinist: ACTION must be thicker for not being able to explain
[23:27] jmoyers: he's supposing that if the server needs to call out to some other server over http, there might be issues?
[23:27] cl0udy has joined the channel
[23:27] jmoyers: for instance -- githubs http post commit hooks
[23:27] jmoyers: something like that
[23:28] bnoordhuis: your http callbacks use port 80 too
[23:28] jmoyers: in my mind, im imagining it all works out magically, though
[23:28] jmoyers: ^
[23:28] bnoordhuis: those REDIRECT iptables rules also work for local traffic
[23:28] swaj: meh, that shouldn't matter.  it should just work.  remote apps can call in over the public port, and the node app can call out to whatever it wants.
[23:28] Determinist: swaj: again, with postbacks the node guy does care... if i need to tell another server, programatically that it needs to send me http requests to an address and i need to take the address and port from the config, then it means the config needs to contain both the public port and the internal port.
[23:28] jmoyers: ACTION thought so, but didn't know for sure
[23:28] Determinist: jmoyers: yeah, it could work very well, but i hate this magic thing. it's not obvious.
[23:28] swaj: Determinist: right, sure.  But iptables handles that.
[23:29] jmoyers: well
[23:29] Determinist: swaj: how so, sire?
[23:29] jmoyers: look
[23:29] jmoyers: its analogous to anything in the network stack
[23:29] swaj: Determinist: because iptables forwards everything it gets on that port to your app.  Your app doesn't have to care where it came from really.
[23:29] jmoyers: you don't have to know shit about tcp to use nodes http stack
[23:30] jmoyers: similarly, you don't have to know shit about the firewall rules to run your application
[23:30] bnoordhuis: 'transparent' is the keyword here
[23:30] jmoyers: ^
[23:30] Determinist: swaj: node app makes a request to server X, puts in a GET parameter where server X should make a request to once it's done processing something that got initiated by the request. node app needs to know where it is located (hostname, port) publicly so it can tell server X where to make the request to. getting me?
[23:31] swaj: Determinist: I understand exactly what you're saying, but how is that any different if your node app were listening directly on port 80?
[23:31] swaj: Determinist: you'd still need to know the public URL for your site.
[23:31] swaj: Determinist: the private one doesn't matter.
[23:31] ajpiaNOU has joined the channel
[23:32] Determinist: swaj: single configuration. right now i have 2 parameters in my config that tell the node app what hostname it is on and what port to bind the http server to.
[23:32] jmoyers: Determinist does your firewall explicitly drop http over 8080?
[23:32] jmoyers: or whatever port
[23:32] jmoyers: oh, nm -- its not that big of a deal
[23:32] jmoyers: its just standard practice
[23:33] jmoyers: otherwise you'll have to convince your sysadmin to run bleeding edge software as root
[23:33] jmoyers: and by the way -- they wont even LET me use node for external tasks
[23:33] jmoyers: ACTION thinks you should feel lucky
[23:33] swaj: Determinist: man that's pretty OCD.  Honestly it's standard procedure to run a proxy (or some sort of port forwarding) on port 80 and then have your various node/whatever apps listening on private ports :/
[23:34] Determinist: jmoyers: irrelevant. i'm an app developer, i shouldn't care about the firewall settings. i should be given a port and hostname and be able to know where my app is running according to that combination. anything else mixes up between the admin's duties and the developer's duties, complicating matters and creating things that could break in the future when some dumb admin decides to remove iptable rules that seem not to be in use according to the

[23:34] Determinist: yeah yeah, i'm not the one making this distinction, btw. the admin guy is.
[23:35] swaj: Determinist: so your sysadmin has given you that.  a private ip/port and a public hostname.  Standard operating procedure :)
[23:35] jmoyers: also im curious
[23:35] Determinist: :P
[23:35] Determinist: well fine.
[23:35] jmoyers: you cant just use the http headers?
[23:35] jmoyers: or whatever

[23:55] MooGoo: wikipedia is written in php
[23:55] halfhalo: those bastards
[23:55] jmoyers: all im saying is, you can use whatever technology you want, frankly
[23:55] swaj: so is Facebook :P
[23:55] jmoyers: it all mostly works :-P
[23:55] MooGoo: facebook is trash, never used it
[23:55] Determinist: mostly
[23:56] Determinist: just... almost :P
[23:56] swaj: except the best part is where Facebook wrote a PHP -> C compiler :P
[23:56] Marak: mediawiki is the biggest POS software 
[23:56] jmoyers: C++
[23:56] v8bot:  jmoyers has given a beer to C. C now has 13 beers.
[23:56] jmoyers: and also
[23:56] MooGoo: mediawiki markup is also horrendus
[23:56] jmoyers: according to some recent meetup i went to
[23:56] Marak: fuck mediawiki hard, never again
[23:56] jmoyers: hiphop only gives them like a 1%ish boost?

[23:56] jerrysv: hahaha
[23:56] Marak: jmoyers: thats the idea, something like that
[23:56] Determinist: frankly, i guess MS products are decent, if you're into BSDM. and besides, stackoverflow is stable because they have damned good programmers, not because of their platform choices
[23:56] jerrysv: C wins again
[23:56] Marak: jmoyers: that extra 1% is a lot for facebook
[23:57] jmoyers: well shit yes

[23:57] jensn: jmoyers: That's pretty silly... I have heard higher numbers, but it wasn't lol-impressive either.
[23:57] MooGoo: they just cost money
[23:57] MooGoo: technicly
[23:57] jmoyers: all im saying is, php with apc isn't all that terrible
[23:57] jmoyers: its awful to look at
[23:57] jmoyers: but thats about it
[23:57] MooGoo: windows 7 still beats the pants off of any linux desktop
[23:57] Marak: jmoyers: i know people who swear by that shit 
[23:57] mikey_p: i got to watch rasmus and the hiphop guy argue about PHP and performance at a meetup once, that was pretty funny

[23:57] Marak: and namespaces guys!
[23:57] Marak: we finally got namespaces!
[23:57] mikey_p: summary: rasmus to facebook: you're doing it wrong
[23:57] swaj: I run a wordpress blog with nginx + php-fpm... it's pretty good.
[23:57] jmoyers: fuck, they even have a sinatra clone!
[23:57] MooGoo: and "closures"

[23:58] MooGoo: it's still an ugly as fuck language
[23:58] jensn: mikey_p: I am pretty sure they know that they are doing it wrong.
[23:58] Determinist: MooGoo: OS X ftw on the desktop, as for the server... ubuntu/debian or redhat/centos rock my world.
[23:58] jensn: mikey_p: I also think they think that doing it the wrong way is worth it.
[23:58] MooGoo: I used to be partial to gentoo

[23:59] Determinist: php is an abomination that will slowly die and the sooner the better.
