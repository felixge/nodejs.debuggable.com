[00:33] xandy: that's why v8/node stops at 1gb atm

[01:35] dhasenan: There is a symlink in /proc/self/fd/1.

[02:10] Gigawattz: process.title

[02:11] mscdex: when you change process.title, you will set the process title that shows up when you do `ps`
[02:11] Gigawattz: so this is not the window title
[02:11] mscdex: or `top`
[02:11] mscdex: if you want to change the window title, you have to use some escape characters to set that

[07:22] eydaimon: is there any way to run system calls?
[07:22] chapel: e6nian: do you know how callbacks and scope works?
[07:22] e6nian: chapel: by the way, is this style of coding non-block?
[07:22] e6nian: chapel: not actually.
[07:23] chapel: non-block? you mean asynchronous ?
[07:23] chapel: or non-blocking
[07:23] e6nian: chapel: non-blocking
[07:23] eydaimon: chapel: any idea?
[07:23] chapel: using callbacks doesn't necessarily mean its non-blocking, you can still block the main process, but using callbacks is key, and most if not all node code is based around callbacks
[07:24] chapel: eydaimon: what kind of system calls?
[07:24] eydaimon: chapel: like I want to just run a traceroute and print the stdout to a socket or some such

[08:25] chapel: var progress = (stream.bytesReceived / stream.bytesTotal * 100).toFixed(2);
[08:25] indexzero: chapel: yeah, but I'm trying to output this progress on the client-side

[08:26] chapel: browser or cli?

[08:26] indexzero: chapel: yes https://github.com/nodejitsu/jitsu/blob/master/lib/jitsu/api/client.js#L91

[08:54] chapel: hmm maybe not jwl
[08:54] jwl: chapel: yeah
[08:55] jwl: i think i could just check if it starts with /
[08:55] JacobSingh has joined the channel

[08:55] zkirill has joined the channel

[08:56] chapel:  /Users/chapel/../chapel/ will = /Users/chapel/
[08:56] jwl: if its not starting with / then its not an absolute one
[08:57] jwl: yeah but that is not the ase
[08:57] jwl: case
[08:57] jwl: i want to check is a path absolute or relative
[08:57] chapel: yeah
[08:57] chapel: well just check for /
[08:57] chapel: or
[08:57] chapel: use path.resolve
[08:58] chapel: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.7/api/path.html#path.resolve
[08:58] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[08:58] chapel: if you feed it relative paths, it will give you an absolute path
[08:59] jwl: chapel: okay
[08:59] chapel: var test = path.resolve('./test.js'); // '/full/dir/to/test.js'
[08:59] jwl: the problem is that i am calling a function to pass a relative path
[08:59] chapel: ?
[08:59] jwl: eg. createDir('new');
[09:00] jwl: no this
[09:00] jwl: createDir('new/dir');
[09:00] jwl: and that function is in another file .. so it will create new/dir from its location
[09:00] jwl: not from the file i called it
[09:00] jwl: you get me=
[09:00] jwl: ?
[09:00] chapel: oh
[09:00] jwl: i dont know how to solve this 
[09:01] jwl: so i thought .. you can only pass an absolute path into the function .. if you throw relative then it will throw an error
[09:01] chapel: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.7/api/fs.html#fs.mkdir
[09:01] chapel: not using that?
[09:01] tobmaster has joined the channel
[09:01] jwl: that function was just a dummy function
[09:01] jwl: the concept is the same
[09:02] jwl: createApp("windows") .. then i want it to create from that location .. not from the location where the function is
[09:02] jwl: maybe there is a way to get the calling file?
[09:02] jwl: it should work somehow
[09:02] chapel: mkdir works with relative paths
[09:03] chapel: I just tested it using node repl
[09:03] jwl: yeah but im not talking about the built in functions .. im creating my own functions
[09:03] niftylettuce: anyone here want a few hours of work tomorrow (Monday) to help me finish a node.js project?
[09:03] chapel: when using mkdir, it makes it relative to where the shell is currently at

I think cb can be offcourse so powerful, yet for defining a protocol, and checking that the clients (maybe there are no checks in this case, or that the cb with the bounded variable does the check itself) seems a bit obscure to me. But i will give a try

[14:53] brianc: I got a few questions about DNS w/ node...
[14:53] brianc: and DNS in general
[14:53] chapel: shoot
[14:54] brianc: does connecting to "localhost" require a dns lookup? (at least looking up the host file)?
[14:54] mscdex: it shouldn't
[14:55] brianc: Reason I'm asking is I'd like node-postgres to connect to any hostname but the libpq bindings do a blocking dns lookup...so I was thinking I could do the DNS lookup before creating the connection in libpq if a hostname was passed, and wanted to known if I should skip the node async dns lookup for localhost as well as ip addresses
[14:55] sirkitre_ has joined the channel
[14:55] pig has joined the channel
[14:55] chapel: I wouldn't think so
[14:56] brianc: basically: you want to connect to postgres? using 'localhost' or an ip address? go right ahead.  Not using localhost or an ip address?  Hold on one second while I use node to do the dns lookup on your host name so libpq doesn't block yer node process.
[14:56] brianc: libpq supports async operation but it looks like much of the initial socket initialization and connection is blocking, so...trying to cut down on that

[14:57] niftylettuce: chapel: this RPC (e.g. the browserling example) would be more efficient than simply node/express??
[14:57] SubStack: niftylettuce: express is another niche entirely
[14:57] niftylettuce: chapel: I guess we could have a server running the game and another running the front-end of the site/registration/etc.
[14:57] SubStack: niftylettuce: dnode plays nicely with express
[14:58] chapel: what SubStack said
[14:58] coreb: with jade, how do I do a default value for a non submitted locals variable?
[14:58] EyePulp has joined the channel
[14:58] niftylettuce: SubStack: the key component of dnode is that the client calls all the connections to server versus the server automatically doing it itself?
[14:58] chapel: dnode is not mutually exclusive to express/connect
[14:58] SubStack: niftylettuce: select express from the drop-down: http://browserling.com:9900/
[14:58] niftylettuce: e.g. on page load, the index file has DNode.connect, assuming that the client is the one dependent on connections???
[14:59] lessthanzero has joined the channel
[14:59] Guest92586 has joined the channel
[14:59] SubStack: niftylettuce: dnode.connect() just opens up a bidirectional channel on top of socket.io
[14:59] niftylettuce: SubStack: meaning?
[14:59] chapel: niftylettuce: the client connects to the server requesting the website, the server sends it html and js files, the js files have a bunch of functions including dnode that tell it to connect to the server, and then at that point, there can be a direct connection between server and browser that doesn't actually reload the page, like ajax, but much more robust and easier to code
[15:00] SubStack: from which you can pass json data and functions which get wrapped transparently in order to respond intelligently to asynchronous events without having to roll your own dispatch system
[15:00] niftylettuce: dispatch system?

[15:02] niftylettuce: SubStack: this is very interesting, please explain further if possible
[15:02] SubStack: niftylettuce: usually when you start passing bidirectional data around you've got to route that data to where it needs to go in your program
[15:03] SubStack: that's what I mean by dispatch system
[15:03] SubStack: in dnode you just call functions instead of passing data around directly

[15:24] EyePulp: vier: no - it's server based
[15:24] vier: EyePulp: thanks, i thought so, but was hopeful, as i would like some way of allowing people to connect to clients via html/Ajax etc
[15:25] EyePulp: vier: though maybe you could write a java applet that makes a VM to run node under it.  There might be some performance impact however.  *might*.
[15:26] vier: EyePulp: ahuh, sounds pretty complex though
[15:26] EyePulp: heh - it would be a tremendous waste of time.  it's like asking if you can run apache in a browser.
[15:27] baudehlo: wait, isn't connecting to node.js via Ajax exactly what most people do with it?
[15:27] baudehlo: they just run it on the server not on the client.

[15:28] chapel: seyz: again no word if this works, but conceptually it should http://paste.pocoo.org/show/377921/
[15:28] baudehlo: vier: what's wrong with Ajax to the server (which would be node)?
[15:28] EyePulp: vier: node is a server.  your browser is a client.  Your client can connect to a server, and node can be that server.

I am attempting to use the module with a loader that doesn't understand 'module' so revising code to use 'exports' only so will work everywhere.  In cases such as this I have typically done (function() { exports.something = function() {blah blah}).call(this) which has worked quite well but this module is giving me grief. It is quite a small piece

[16:26] isaacs: aphelion: here's a technique to try out, it's not always best, but it is illuminating: Don't use anonymous functions.
[16:28] addisonj: no example?
[16:28] techwraith: isaacs, that's some pretty good advice :)
[16:28] isaacs: aphelion: https://gist.github.com/940752
[16:28] EyePulp: sitting in #node.js isn't nearly as instructional as coming up with a very basic data storage example and seeing how it maps to the different options.  But it *is* is easier to just wiat for someone to tell you "no, do this" in here...
[16:28] aphelion: EyePulp: i'm currently using mongoose, i'm just curious about how people feel about other options. :)

[16:29] EyePulp: aphelion: I didn't see, but did you mention a particular use-case you're having trouble with?
[16:29] isaacs: aphelion: once you see how you can *chain* callbacks rather than *nest* callbacks, it opens up a lot of doors for flow control that are simply not available in the sync-world
[16:30] aphelion: i'm personally pretty interested in couch's N-master P2P replication strategy, so might end up switching from mongo to couch
[16:30] aphelion: EyePulp: nope. pretty open ended. just asked what people enjoy using. :)
[16:30] isaacs: aphelion: the popular complaint that CPS requires unreasonable indentation is a strawman.
[16:30] isaacs: aphelion: i like couch a lot
[16:30] isaacs: aphelion: the npm registry is a couchapp
[16:31] aphelion: isaacs: hmm. nice
[16:31] aphelion: that's definitely interesting to know
[16:31] DennisRasmussen has joined the channel
[16:31] addisonj: speaking of doing something, i am curious about anything any body is doing with socket.io and express. It seems like if want to use the two together, you end up with a nice amount of redundancy between the socket.io stuff and express stuff, am I wrong in that?
[16:31] aphelion: might take a look at the npm search site repo to learn best practices there
[16:32] aphelion: isaacs: thankyou for that 
[16:32] themiddleman_itv has joined the channel
[16:32] addisonj: but mongo is faster than couch ;)
[16:32] isaacs: addisonj: is it really?
[16:33] moshe: i cant run nodejs make, it says project not configured (run 'waf configure' first)
[16:33] isaacs: aphelion: http://github.com/isaacs/npmjs.org
[16:33] chapel: addisonj: re: socketio/express, they are different; re: mongo/couch, that isn't true
[16:33] isaacs: aphelion: the search was written by mikeal, who knows a thing or two about couchdb
[16:33] moshe: i cant run nodejs make, it says project not configured (run 'waf configure' first), anyone please?
[16:33] addisonj: for my use cases it is, but I am not trying to start a flame war... just being a bit cheeky i guess
[16:33] isaacs: moshe: ./configure
[16:34] isaacs: moshe: this is also covered in the readme
[16:34] chapel: addisonj: what is your use case?
[16:34] aphelion: i'm not particularly concerned about "fast" for this, as i'm using it as a backing store for scraping results, and most of my time will be spent waiting for responses and downloading those. processing the responses and saving some metadata is going to be a small chunk of that time.
[16:34] SubStack: http://browserling.com:9900/
[16:34] pdelgallego has joined the channel
[16:35] isaacs: since node doesn't block your app for the IO, couch and mongo are often comparable.
[16:35] Aikar: isaacs: what about latency?
[16:35] Aikar: the idea of http call per query seems to open gate for a latency diff
[16:36] isaacs: Aikar: if your couch is on localhost, it's probably not relevant
[16:36] Aikar: does it keep alive?
[16:36] isaacs: Aikar: also, you can write views to do a lot of the processing on the backend.
[16:36] isaacs: in node 0.4, yes, if you re-use agents, i believe so

[16:38] a|i: what's a good architecture for share authentication between node and rails?
[16:38] aphelion: what i AM concerned about is deploying to the cloud and having unreliable virtual hardware... if i'm on EC2 and an EBS store dies on me, i don't want to -accidentally- crawl a site over and over... possibly bringing it down and then getting blocked. so yeah, couch's N-master P2P replication is VERY interesting to me.
[16:38] addisonj: with lots of updates, and from what I read and a few basic tests, mongo wins out over couch
[16:38] JacobSingh has joined the channel
[16:38] context: aphelion: you should take a look at Riak also
[16:38] aphelion: having nodes go down wouldn't really effect me for my use, so i'm not worried about that as long as it doesn't result in over-crawling a site and making the owner grumpy. :)

[16:47] ilya: jetienne: correct
[16:47] ilya: anybody could help me with Express app?
[16:47] aphelion: EyePulp: aren't there two flavors of fsync though? ensure sync to backing store, and then another that additionally attempts to ensure that the disk itself has flushed its' own buffers? i know that OSX has both and that they're different.
[16:47] ilya: specifically, Express app error handling
[16:48] blueadept has joined the channel

[16:49] aphelion: EyePulp: ah. it does seem that mysql only uses fullfsync on darwin, despite it being available on other platforms. that could certainly contribute to the problem. 
[16:50] balaa: why use node of twisted?
[16:50] balaa: over*
[16:50] broofa__ has joined the channel
[16:50] balaa: is it because web developers don't know python?
[16:51] aphelion: balaa: hey hey... some of us get paid pretty well to write python
[16:51] tiemonster: balaa: that's a silly and naive question/statement
[16:52] EyePulp: balaa: I've heard mixed reviews of twisted docs as well as design philosophy.  I'm a python dev the majority of the time, but I find JS syntax maps better to the async callback idiom common for evented programming.
[16:52] balaa: aphelion: as do i..
[16:52] tiemonster: as a python developer, I can honestly say that event-driven programming is way easier in javascript
[16:52] balaa: anyone here actually used twisted?

[16:53] EyePulp: ACTION built a simple test system out of it a year or so ago to see it in action
[16:53] aphelion: balaa: you could rephrase your question as "why use node over eventmachine? is it because web developers don't know ruby?". yet fair portions of github's production architecture is in node, rather than ruby.

[17:28] tbranyen: getting higher and higher
[17:28] tjholowaychuk: ndistro would be great if compiling the binaries all the time was not so annoying
[17:29] fairwinds: tjholowaychuk: yeah, there is fork on git. I agree.
[17:31] ilya: tiemonster: already did. However, I can't reproduce it anymore, higher or not.
[17:31] fairwinds: tjholowaychuck: it is just an option from what I saw. I just encountered it yesteday. Not bad to have a choice

[17:31] ilya: tiemonster: yup, I'm sure I'll see it in production :))
[17:32] tjholowaychuk: fairwinds: we could also switch to using node_modules so that ./bin/node is not necessary
[17:32] isaacs: hunterloftis: if you're using 1.0, you don't need bundle
[17:32] tjholowaychuk: well not required at least
[17:32] isaacs: hunterloftis: it bundles whenever you don't set the -g flag for --global

[17:32] isaacs: cc: fairwinds ^
[17:33] hunterloftis: isaacs: cool feature, thanks - I'll look into that later on, right now I just need to get something externally visible ;)
[17:33] tjholowaychuk: fairwinds: but without precompiled binaries the new npm is basically what ndistro was built for
[17:33] ilya: tjholowaychuk: am I correct that using express.errorHandler will prevent app.error from error handling?
[17:33] tjholowaychuk: though for deployment the precompiled bins would be a big win
[17:33] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: just wait.  npm 1.0 does precompiled binaries :)
[17:33] isaacs: it doesn't *quite* work as robustly as i'd like atm
[17:33] tjholowaychuk: ilya: yeah, you dont need both
[17:33] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: does it? sweet :D
[17:34] fairwinds: wow. npm 1.0 is sounding awesome :-)
[17:34] techwraith: :)
[17:34] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: yeah, when you publish with 1.0, it'll pre-build and upload a prebuilt tarball with no install scrit
[17:34] ilya: tjholowaychuk: would express.errorHandler give a more detail error info?
[17:34] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: ohhh, I meant node binaries
[17:35] isaacs: oh, yeah, there's no npm package for node
[17:35] isaacs: but we've talked about using that same mechanism for distributing/testing/building node
[17:35] tjholowaychuk: ilya: errorHandler is usually the one you want during development so you can expose the stack trace etc
[17:35] fairwinds: isaacs: this would be great
[17:35] isaacs: once we get binary add-on distribution solid, doing the same thing for node isn't *that* much harder.

[18:05] hunterloftis: c4milo: thank you sir

[18:06] sh1mmer: Qwepoi: also using try/catch is fine to stop exception propagation which is annoying

[18:16] c4milo: hunterloftis: you know how to deal with upstart right?
[18:17] hunterloftis: c4milo: yep - I've been using it at my webbynode.com host for a while, but their scripts are old, crufty, and brittle (and needlessly complex)
[18:17] hunterloftis: So I'm replacing their complex rapp, upstart, upload hook, etc stuff with just a basic git push + upstart script
[18:19] jdp has joined the channel

[18:20] dmcquay has joined the channel
[18:20] hunterloftis: c4milo: and your upstart script is way simpler than the one I inherited ;)
[18:20] niftylettuce: how do i only show installed packages

[18:50] Allin has joined the channel
[18:51] mdwright_laptop: Essentially I'm trying to login, but if I send the message too early, the server responds with a "not registered" message (if I wait and send it after a couple seconds it works, but I don't want to rely on arbitrary waiting"
[18:51] jesusabdullah: hmm
[18:51] eee_c has joined the channel
[18:51] mdwright_laptop: I'd wait for the registered event, but it seems to fire before I can even setup a listener
[18:51] jesusabdullah: I think what you want to do is wait for the 'motd' event
[18:51] teemow has joined the channel
[18:51] jesusabdullah: Once you get that, you *know* you're connected
[18:52] jesusabdullah: so you can treat it like a "ready" event
[18:52] mdwright_laptop: Yeah. I'm worried that for some reason I won't get the listener added in time. I wish I could add listeners before I actually connect =/
[18:52] jesusabdullah: It should be okay
[18:52] jesusabdullah: I've never had any issues
[18:52] mdwright_laptop: Haha, yeah. The Should be is what worries me :-)
[18:53] jesusabdullah: I bet it's more robust than you'd think intuitively
[18:53] mdwright_laptop: Yeah, probably. Thanks!
[18:53] jesusabdullah: At any rate, it usually takes *seconds* to get connected to a network, so
[18:53] jesusabdullah: Yeah, have fun! :D
[18:54] baudehlo: remember that node is single threaded, so although it looks like there might be race conditions, there aren't.
[18:54] mdwright_laptop: baudehlo: this is a good point. on the other hand, are there any plans to make node multithreaded? I'd hate to rely on behavior like that. It feels terribly wrong.
[18:55] baudehlo: not in that sense, no.
[18:55] baudehlo: (no, there are no plans)
[18:55] mdwright_laptop: Alright
[18:55] baudehlo: I keep pushing for some sort of facility to have another thread do "work" but it won't break anything we've talked about here.
[18:55] mdwright_laptop: jesusabdullah: Just so you know, waiting on motd works for me
[18:56] mdwright_laptop: baudehlo: webworks for node?
[18:56] jesusabdullah: Awesome :)
[18:56] baudehlo: web sockets works already, but to transfer data back and forth requires serialisation
[18:56] TheDeveloper: what do you guys think of the npm plugin cluster as a way to spawn multiple node processes
[18:57] baudehlo: we all use it and love it.
[18:57] mdwright_laptop: My metaphor would have to be extended then. "node has a worker thread which is like a webworker for node, which in turn is like a process on the web". At some point we've come full circle, no? :-) 
[18:57] V1: cluster is awesome, it's like startup porn for node
[18:57] tjholowaychuk: V1 bahaha
[18:57] TheDeveloper: ha good to hear, planning on using it in production
[18:57] baudehlo: TheDeveloper: the author of cluster (tjholowaychuk) is on the channel so we have to say this or he'd kill us.
[18:58] mdwright_laptop: Ooh, thanks. That looks pretty awesome.
[18:58] EyePulp: tjholowaychuk == ron jeremy of the node world?  interesting.

[18:58] V1: Got a better way to describe it ;)?

[18:58] pdelgallego has joined the channel
[18:59] tjholowaychuk: the new cluster supports server-less support too which is cool
[18:59] tjholowaychuk: for any of you guys processing jobs etc

[19:18] jacobolus has joined the channel
[19:18] tjholowaychuk: coreb: each command that references the key checks if it's expired
[19:18] tjholowaychuk: there are no timers or anything
[19:19] tjholowaychuk: if you do GET foo and it's expired, it still exists, until you issue that GET
[19:19] tjholowaychuk: but SETEX is the command connect-redis uses
[19:20] coreb: I mean, if a user fills his shopping cart with data, but just abandons his session - how will that data eventualle disappear from redis?
[19:21] coreb: eventually*
[19:22] TheDeveloper: coreb: set an expire on the redis key
[19:22] tjholowaychuk: coreb: if the user leaves for a while, comes back, redis tries to GET that sid, finds that it's expired
[19:22] TheDeveloper: http://redis.io/commands/expire
[19:22] tjholowaychuk: and turfs it
[19:23] aroop has joined the channel

[19:30] jacksonmills has joined the channel

[19:34] MikeW: tjholowaychuk: Oh I was just wondering why the files were .CC and I thought that might be what they were?
[19:34] isaacs: (ahem.) ;)
[19:34] tjholowaychuk: coreb: yeah but AFAIK it could still be a problem, pretty sure redis doesnt reap those
[19:34] tjholowaychuk: unless accessed
[19:34] tjholowaychuk: not positive
[19:34] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: hey!  did i show you this?https://gist.github.com/939799

[19:34] fyskij has joined the channel
[19:34] tjholowaychuk: MikeW: cpp, cc, meh
[19:34] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: i'm gonna convince you to stop using jscoverage by writing a much better coverage library ;)
[19:35] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: haha cool. no need to convince me, the only reason im using it is because it works haha
[19:35] isaacs: and then expresso will compile on solaris
[19:35] tjholowaychuk: so anything else that works
[19:35] tjholowaychuk: is fine by me
[19:35] sriprasanna has joined the channel
[19:35] coreb: tjholowaychuk: if it's possible to limit how much memory redis can use, maybe it will get rid of timed out entries when that cap is reached
[19:36] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: where exactly in expresso are you using it?  i'll see if i can have my thing just mimic the same API if it makes sense, or at least send you a pull req to use mine
[19:36] brianmario has joined the channel
[19:36] tjholowaychuk: coreb: yeah not sure, would be nice to know
[19:37] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: there is a sloppy exec() I believe, that invokes node-jscoverage creating lib-cov
[19:37] tjholowaychuk: with our register extension api
[19:37] isaacs: ok, cool
[19:37] tjholowaychuk: i think you could do it without the mirrored dir
[19:37] sriprasanna has left the channel
[19:37] tjholowaychuk: but i havent tried
[19:37] icebox has joined the channel
[19:37] isaacs: i'm definitely gonna have the coverage thing use registerExtension
[19:38] nciagra has joined the channel
[19:38] isaacs: but maybe have it be as simple as:  coverage.add( "lib/**.js" ); require("lib/foo.js"); coverage.report("lib/foo.js")
[19:39] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[19:39] sveimac has joined the channel
[19:39] isaacs: but it might have to use a mirrored dir, especially since expresso runs tests in parallel, and sometimes you want to run every test as a separate child proc
[19:39] sveimac has joined the channel
[19:40] tjholowaychuk: yeah it might not work out to well
[19:40] tjholowaychuk: for everyone at least
[19:40] isaacs: maybe just have some sort of var foo = cov.require("./lib/foo.js"); and then later, get a single report with every filename
[19:40] isaacs: that'd be simpler.
[19:41] zzak has joined the channel
[19:41] zzak has joined the channel
[19:41] isaacs: i dunno. still at the very experimental stages anyhow
[19:41] isaacs: writing out a specially instrumented mirrored dir is easy
[19:42] isaacs: really, what i want to do is: add coverage, run tests, print out pretty html with code highlighted in red and green or something
[19:42] tjholowaychuk: yup
[19:42] isaacs: and also get heat-reports, so you can see where it's worthwhile to micro-optimize
[19:42] coreb: tjholowaychuk: some info on the subject here; http://apps.ycombinator.com/item?id=1350958
[19:42] isaacs: that is SUPER handy
[19:42] tjholowaychuk: if we had a higher level introspection api like the spidermonkey stuff we could easily come up with mutation based cov as well
[19:43] coreb: weird algorithm with the three random keys
[19:43] konobi: isaacs: you should have a look at Devel::NYTProf and Devel::Cover
[19:43] _nick__ has joined the channel
[19:43] konobi: some nice output there
[19:43] tjholowaychuk: but even just statement based is better than nothing but some people assume that means they have "full" coverage

[19:43] isaacs: ;)
[19:43] hosh_work has joined the channel
[19:44] isaacs: konobi: there's some tools i've used in php-land that do stuff like this.  really handy

[19:45] konobi: isaacs: heh
[19:45] mscdex: baudehlo: meh i don't even know what they use for javascript <-> i/o
[19:45] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: did you use heckle at all?
[19:45] dambalah: I wrote a test suite to test one of my node.js application and when I run it, after it is done testing, the process does not get killed. I'm using vows. I'm wondering how to actually get the process to die after my test suite is done running
[19:45] tjholowaychuk: pretty cool stuff
[19:45] dambalah: o
[19:45] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: what' sheckle?
[19:45] tjholowaychuk: js seems to be lacking with those kinds of tools
[19:45] baudehlo: mscdex: yeah I don't know what they are really planning either.
[19:46] isaacs: oh, a ruby thing
[19:46] dambalah: i've tried app.close() (where app is my express app) and I've tried process.kill()
[19:46] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: it keeps mutating your source and if it doesnt fail
[19:46] tjholowaychuk: you failed
[19:46] tjholowaychuk: haha
[19:46] mscdex: baudehlo: the api i saw for the last spidermonkey-based thing awhile ago looked less than desirable to work with
[19:46] baudehlo: dambalah: did you try process.exit()?
[19:47] onre_ has joined the channel
[19:47] konobi: the base level spidermonkey api is less than nice
[19:47] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: rad
[19:47] konobi: it _works_, just a pita
[19:47] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: you could do stuff like this with uglify's ast really easily
[19:47] tjholowaychuk: konobi: beats a bunch of arrays
[19:47] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: yeah
[19:47] isaacs: meh.  arrays are fine.  feels like lisp :)
[19:47] isaacs: i actually really like it
[19:47] tjholowaychuk: i think uglify is really sloppy
[19:47] tjholowaychuk: but
[19:47] tjholowaychuk: we dont have much else
[19:47] isaacs: it'd be nice if JS had a non-array list type
[19:48] jesusabdullah: What do you have in mind? >:P
[19:48] nailer has joined the channel
[19:48] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: you mentioned its sloppiness before.  how do you mean?
[19:48] jesusabdullah: Like, linked lists?
[19:48] tjholowaychuk: just sloppy implementation
[19:48] mscdex: i forget what framework it was, but the only reason i was looking at it in the first place was because someone had written an ncurses binding for it
[19:48] isaacs: jesusabdullah: like s-exprs
[19:48] tjholowaychuk: having rich ast nodes would be nice
[19:48] tjholowaychuk: but i guess you could generate those
[19:48] tjholowaychuk: from the array
[19:48] jesusabdullah: ah, sexpressions
[19:48] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: just turn on tracing
[19:48] mscdex: and the ncurses binding was so ridiculously all over the place
[19:49] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: then that first item in the array is something like {name:"stat", start: {line:1, col:0}, end:{line:2, col:12}} and some other debuggery
[19:49] konobi: mscdex: oh... nice!
[19:49] konobi: been thinking about doing some ncurses stuff in node at some point
[19:49] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: ah yeah i dont really mean that i mean more like https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SpiderMonkey/Parser_API
[19:49] tjholowaychuk: with protos per node type etc
[19:50] mscdex: yeah i didn't even bother trying to use that binding for the basis of my node ncurses binding
[19:50] mscdex: heh
[19:50] konobi: mscdex: anyone written any UI abstractions atop?
[19:50] tjholowaychuk: like jade / stylus
[19:50] isaacs: oh, i guess.
[19:50] isaacs: there's not really anything in there that isn't in the trace+ast though
[19:50] mscdex: konobi: well, i wrote some basic ui widgets that uses node-ncurses
[19:50] _fat has joined the channel
[19:50] konobi: ah, the spidermonkey reflector
[19:50] tjholowaychuk: yeah im sure you could generate the rich nodes from that
[19:50] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: there is a bit of "implied knowledge" of how each sort of list is structured.
[19:51] konobi: mscdex: window, menu, etc?
[19:51] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: eg, ["block", [list, of, nodes]] vs ["seq", list, of, nodes]
[19:51] mscdex: no menu yet unfortunately
[19:51] mscdex: but window is already there
[19:51] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: yeah that's pretty typical
[19:51] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: but i mean, it's a port of a lisp program.  that's how lisp is annoying.
[19:52] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: s-exprs are flexible enough to be anything.  unfortunately, that means that they're flexible enough to be anything.
[19:52] jesusabdullah: :)
[19:52] isaacs: it doesn't help that the JS syntax is absurdly complicated.
[19:52] mscdex: konobi: thus far, i've got message box, input box, calendar, text viewer, listbox, and marquee
[19:52] mscdex: and there's a file viewer example that uses the text viewer
[19:52] mscdex: :)
[19:52] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: haha have you seen the ruby grammar visualization?
[19:52] tjholowaychuk: it'll make you cry
[19:52] creationix: isaacs: really? try writing a coffeescript or ruby parser
[19:52] tjholowaychuk: such a hack
[19:52] creationix: javascript is simple
[19:52] isaacs: no, but ruby usually makes me cry anyway
[19:53] isaacs: creationix: i'll bet
[19:53] dambalah: baudehlo: thx. vows should exit by itself when the test suite is finished. I found the issue, I had a batch defined without any callbacks so it wouldn't exit
[19:53] dambalah: adding an empty callback method fixed it.
[19:54] tjholowaychuk: creationix: writing the parser generator, takes far more talent than the language grammar IMO
[19:54] tjholowaychuk: as far as coffeescript etc goes
[19:54] mscdex: konobi: fwiw, a command-line script that lets you test out the different widgets: https://github.com/mscdex/node-ncurses/blob/master/examples/widget.js
[19:54] baudehlo: dambalah: yeah finding where things are still "lost in node" is tough :)

[19:55] isaacs: one day, when i decide to stop being useful or productive, i'm going to retire with a pile of cash to a small island, and write a scheme-ish langauge that compiles to JS.
[19:55] konobi: isaacs: any idea how complete narcissus is these days?
[19:56] icebox: what if on joyent machine node --version is v0.4.6 and npm update says node@v0.4.5?
[19:56] isaacs: konobi: i believe it's very complete.  it's be's test bed for stuff
[19:56] isaacs: icebox: maybe npm is using a different node?
[19:56] tjholowaychuk: konobi: some parts dont run on node
[19:56] konobi: oh... mozilla-isms?
[19:56] isaacs: konobi: that being said, it has *every feature ever imagined*
[19:56] tjholowaychuk: konobi: but the parser is fine I believe
[19:56] tjholowaychuk: konobi: yup
[19:56] icebox: isaacs: I didn't touch that
[19:56] tjholowaychuk: catch gaurds n shit
[19:56] isaacs: konobi: it has mozilla-isms that are too crazy for firefox
[19:57] icebox: isaacs: it should be "latest"
[19:57] isaacs: konobi: paren-free and stuff
[19:57] isaacs: icebox: dunno.  what's `npm config get node-version`?
[19:57] isaacs: icebox: oh, on a joyent machine.  sorry, missed that

[19:57] isaacs: icebox: npm is "frozen" at a specific node version on current no.de machines.

[20:01] sridatta: stdout is not working
[20:01] isaacs: djcoin: just copy the file into your project.
[20:01] creationix: tjholowaychuk: what do you use for jade and your css thing?
[20:01] jesusabdullah: djcoin: Alternately, I wrote a prompt module that may do what you like

[20:01] ryah: mraleph: why does v8 suck?
[20:02] djcoin: Oups Im so sorry !!!
[20:02] Aikar: v8 is great
[20:02] tjholowaychuk: creationix: nothing just hand-coded. it's not necessary for jade, but stylus is not context free so highly unlikely that any parser generator could deal with it

[21:28] isaacs: Darshan-NowJS: "Checking for node path                  : not found" isn't an error
[21:28] isaacs: Darshan-NowJS: it's just that there's no NODE_PATH env.  but that's not necessary
[21:29] Darshan-NowJS: isaacs: gotchca
[21:29] Darshan-NowJS: in that case, moshe everything should work just fine..?
[21:29] kuya: chapel: thanks
[21:29] pengwynn has joined the channel
[21:29] Darshan-NowJS: chapel: i dont want to get into a dnode/nowjs war since they both accomplish similar things
[21:30] indexzero has joined the channel
[21:30] chapel: Darshan-NowJS: thats fine, just wasn't too keen on the "if you haven't used NowJS i wouldn't be recommending other things" statement
[21:30] jbpros has joined the channel
[21:30] moshe: yeah, im trying the examples now
[21:30] Darshan-NowJS: well i mean you're supporting dnode without using nowjs
[21:30] Darshan-NowJS: and saying dnode is better, without using nowjs
[21:30] chapel: how do you know I haven't used it?
[21:31] Darshan-NowJS: oh wait
[21:31] Darshan-NowJS: i think i mixed up you and context
[21:31] moshe: its context who didnt 
[21:31] moshe: :)
[21:31] chapel: no worries
[21:31] Darshan-NowJS: whoopsies yeah context, not you :P hehe
[21:31] chapel: I haven't used nowjs much, but then again I have been using dnode for much longer
[21:31] chapel: and as far as being yc, that is awesome, I hope your company does well, in whatever it does
[21:32] Darshan-NowJS: ^_^
[21:32] chapel: I am genuinely happy for anything node.js being successful
[21:32] Darshan-NowJS: ya same
[21:32] chapel: except for a spidermonkey port of node.js
[21:32] chapel: :P
[21:32] jacksonmills has joined the channel
[21:32] Darshan-NowJS: which is also why i like stackvm and SubStack :P
[21:32] tbranyen: chapel: its cool and all, but not really practical
[21:32] Darshan-NowJS: node <3
[21:33] chapel: tbranyen: about spidermonkey?
[21:33] Darshan-NowJS: its funny, while dnode and nowjs are competitive technologies, we're not competitive startups. we're going down completely different routes
[21:33] tbranyen: chapel: v8monkey yeah
[21:33] chapel: my main concern about porting node to another js vm is 3rd party code functionality and compatibility
[21:33] chapel: Darshan-NowJS: yep
[21:33] tbranyen: well just think about every single native module
[21:33] V1: haters gonna hate
[21:34] tbranyen: kaboom
[21:34] chapel: yeah
[21:34] chapel: or the c++ modules
[21:34] tbranyen: right thats what i meant by native :D
[21:34] chapel: oh :P
[21:34] tbranyen: unless they can emulate even the v8 header
[21:34] chapel: I think that would really cripple node.js expansion
[21:34] tbranyen: and everything that comes along with it
[21:34] jbpros has joined the channel
[21:34] stride: chapel: aren't they doing a complete interface for v8 with their v8monkey thing?
[21:34] chapel: if they can do it with no impact to 3rd party code, then maybe
[21:35] tbranyen: just seems wrong tho
[21:35] chapel: I agree
[21:35] tbranyen: exposing a v8 namespace when its not v8
[21:35] chapel: I am not for it
[21:35] jbpros has joined the channel
[21:35] jbpros has joined the channel
[21:35] tbranyen: taking all that effort into decoupling node efficiently would probably be time better spent
[21:36] tbranyen: but what do i know, i'm just a girl
[21:36] kuya: wasnt someone just saying competition is a good thing? :)
[21:36] Darshan-NowJS: lol
[21:37] tbranyen: kuya: its not really competition tho, when they have nothing to compete with other than maybe weird architecture support

[21:38] chapel: idk
[21:39] chapel: Chrome user since version 1 :)
[21:39] Darshan-NowJS: it took me a full month to switch from Firebug to Chrome web inspector
[21:39] EvanCarroll: firefox needs vimperator
[21:39] jamesarosen has joined the channel
[21:39] EvanCarroll: I've made the conversion, but I'm not sure the stability or speed makes up for the inept interface wo/ vimperator
[21:39] mikeal: chrome beta broke really badly for me last week
[21:39] mikeal: all css caching fails
[21:40] mikeal: so i'm back on firefox and severely annoyed by the in page search compared to chrome
[21:40] mikeal: firebug has gotten better tho
[21:40] EvanCarroll: I think firefox does that batter.
[21:40] EvanCarroll: better*
[21:40] mikeal: no way
[21:40] EvanCarroll: firefox in page search/vimperator/firebug/web dev toolbar
[21:40] djktno has joined the channel
[21:40] EvanCarroll: all of that stuff i think chrome needs to improve
[21:40] mikeal: in page search is much nicer in chrome, it tells you how many are found and highlights them all, not just the current one
[21:41] EvanCarroll: and the download manager
[21:41] mikeal: safari does a great job too
[21:41] mikeal: the download manager in chrome is better than firefox
[21:41] EvanCarroll: that's not a feature I need.
[21:41] mikeal: firefox had a new download manager that didn't make it in to the last release
[21:41] mikeal: but it was much nicer
[21:41] mikeal: but
[21:41] mikeal: Firefox location bar
[21:41] mikeal: soooooooooooooooooo much better
[21:42] mikeal: the search across history and bookmarks is really fast and quite accurate
[21:42] arunagw has joined the channel
[21:42] chapel: well I like googles url bar
[21:42] chapel: not having to use a separate search bar just to search google is nice
[21:42] Darshan-NowJS: the biggest benefit that firefox still doesn't have is the sandboxing
[21:43] EvanCarroll: security isn't the end all for me.
[21:43] Darshan-NowJS: its so annoying when divx (or something) crashes, but at least it only brings down on tab
[21:43] EvanCarroll: I'll sacrafice it to get back my vimperator
[21:43] jamesaro_ has joined the channel
[21:43] chapel: it isn't about scurity
[21:43] chapel: security
[21:43] chapel: for me
[21:43] chapel: its about stability
[21:43] chapel: rarely does chrome crash completely
[21:43] chapel: I run dev, have been for years now
[21:43] newy has joined the channel
[21:44] tbranyen: chome has been giving me shit on my new linux box at work with google maps
[21:44] tbranyen: i think i have some funky acceleration issues
[21:44] EvanCarroll: I have to wonder if chrome could sandbox adobe better
[21:44] EvanCarroll: why does a crash in one tabs flash affect the other flashes
[21:44] EvanCarroll: can you compiel to spawn seperate plugins per tab?
[21:44] bradleymeck: EvanCarroll the way npn protocol works
[21:44] chapel: EvanCarroll: flash is sandboxed now
[21:45] chapel: or last I heard
[21:45] fljitovak has joined the channel
[21:45] tbranyen: oh ha i had some 2d bs enabled in about:flags
[21:45] EvanCarroll: right, but "sandboxed" there means from the browser
[21:45] tbranyen: disabled that and all is good
[21:45] EvanCarroll: not per tab/process
[21:45] EvanCarroll: crashing it, crashes it for every tab.
[21:46] bradleymeck: basically the "pepper" extension helps, but doesnt fix how NPAPI browser plugins work, they are single processes in the background (or at least masquerade as)
[21:46] chapel: oh, well maybe, I haven't had that issue in a while
[21:46] chapel: would need a faulty flash app to test
[21:47] chapel: would be annoying to run flash for every process, would increase the memory usage
[21:47] bradleymeck: tootallnate about?
[21:47] EvanCarroll: chapel: you could make that arguement about anything sandboxed.
[21:47] TooTallNate: howdy
[21:48] chapel: EvanCarroll: sure, but 64mb+ added to each process/tab would be hefty
[21:48] EvanCarroll: chapel: flash player doesn't take 64mb
[21:48] echong has joined the channel
[21:48] chapel: well the process does
[21:48] bradleymeck: heya tootall, im using your tls starttls wrapper, and was wondering about timeouts and failed negotiations, cant really see if just forwarding the timeout event would be enough, and cant tell if there is a way to see that authentication failed but the connection is still open
[21:49] duncanbeevers: I thought the Flash VM gets a sandbox shared between the various browser processes.
[21:49] chapel: my idle flash process in activity monitor shows 64.8MB
[21:49] duncanbeevers: So when Flash dies in one tab, it dies in all tabs.
[21:50] EvanCarroll: duncanbeevers: it does
[21:50] TooTallNate: bradleymeck: not quite sure. I've never actually used the code myself, lol.
[21:50] bradleymeck: ACTION falls over
[21:51] alexandere has joined the channel
[21:51] boghog: does that 65MB include shared libs etc?
[21:51] chapel: boghog: I don't know, could be a lot of stuff
[21:52] chapel: it is conjecture at this point
[21:52] EvanCarroll: where did you get that number?
[21:52] boghog: the usage chapel reported but rounded up for no apparant reason
[21:53] chapel: well it is at 64.9 now :P
[21:53] chapel: and this is osx, so its base 10 not 2, I think I have that right
[21:54] nrbafna has joined the channel
[21:54] mscdex: bradleymeck: you've seen the starttls example in the tls docs right?
