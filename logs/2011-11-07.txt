[01:55] quackquack: SubStack: is browserify a good fit even if I dont want to use node modules client side, just the module.exports/require style of packages, or is it overkill?
[01:55] isaacs: maybe try `npm cache clean`
[01:55] chilts: (oh, and I just updated to v0.6.0 and npm version 1.0.104)

[05:12] te-brian2: wookiehangover: What do you use to debug ... node-inspector rendered useless?
[05:12] wookiehangover: MooGoo: cause you don't assume that you write perfect code the first time, all the time?
[05:12] MooGoo: what does perfect have to do with anal
[05:13] wookiehangover: te-brian2: debugging is the same
[05:13] te-brian2: wookiehangover: Except you are not debuggin your own source, correct?
[05:13] wookiehangover: MooGoo: cause its a programming language, not a letter to your grandmother
[05:13] MooGoo: I try to make my code look less ridiciules where possible
[05:14] wookiehangover: te-brian2: `debugger` works the same
[05:14] wookiehangover: you get used to debugging through compiled output
[05:14] wookiehangover: i mean, its not like its writing it in arabic or something
[05:14] HeikoR has joined the channel
[05:14] wookiehangover: its just js
[05:14] wookiehangover: MooGoo: that's what jshint is for
[05:14] te-brian2: wookiehangover: I assume you are gonna be dealing with all these added closures and whatnot
[05:15] wookiehangover: it has a more modern take, better configurations too
[05:15] Emmanuel` has joined the channel
[05:15] wookiehangover: te-brian2: I've never found that to be a problem
[05:15] wookiehangover: and you can turn off the global closure with --compile-bare
[05:15] MooGoo: actully I'm fairly certain I write "perfect" code 99% of the time
[05:16] MooGoo: if perfect means not leaking global vars
[05:16] wookiehangover: srsly, just take something you've already written and re-write it in cs
[05:16] HeikoR: Hi - anybody use node_buffer in windows c++ addon ?
[05:16] te-brian2: wookiehangover: I will give it a try

[05:16] HeikoR: Can't link Buffer::New in my windows C++ addon (node0.6.0)
[05:16] wookiehangover: MooGoo: that could happen to you, Mr RockStar
[05:17] te-brian2: wookiehangover:  Yeah... I've read that ...  but its not like they 'missed a var' ... they had scope issues.  (it just so happens that adding a var might have fixed it)
[05:17] MooGoo: ok lets see..

[05:21] AAA_awright: If I wanted to write ECMAScript, I would write to ECMAScript, not some other thing
[05:21] wookiehangover: the vim plugins for jshint and jslint are great

[05:21] AAA_awright: s/to /

[05:21] wookiehangover: no, for all people
[05:22] te-brian2: wookiehangover: dont get trolled .. not worth your time.

[05:29] wookiehangover: Lingerance: or use it as a bundle with pathogen
[05:29] wookiehangover: that's what I recommend
[05:29] Lingerance: What does it do?
[05:29] wookiehangover: it makes all plugins indenpendently installable
[05:29] wookiehangover: https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen
[05:29] Lingerance: I meant yours, how does it activate?
[05:30] wookiehangover: read the docs for https://github.com/hallettj/jslint.vim
[05:30] wookiehangover: its literally the same lib with different js
[05:31] dgathright has joined the channel
[05:31] wookiehangover: but once you install it will start working the next time you restart vim
[05:31] wookiehangover: it will highlight broken js, and respect config options in c-style comments at the top of files
[05:32] wookiehangover: as well as any globals set in ~/.jshintrc

[05:50] Advant: bit of a cluster
[05:50] Aria: ... That's a bit out of scope for both this channel and my experience. Sounds like you're not in node at all where you're having the problem.

[07:09] benvie: some others
[07:09] Aria: What about the headers?
[07:10] benvie: just making sure he's linking the right stuff. Simple fix
[07:10] kawaz_home has joined the channel
[07:10] Aria: Ah. Right.
[07:11] benvie: opinion question
[07:11] p1d has joined the channel
[07:12] benvie: well context
[07:13] benvie: it looks like this serialize to json and then remotely reconstruct the whole structure thing I've been working on is pretty much done
[07:13] benvie: in terms of, prototype chains
[07:13] HeikoR: hi benie - your advice got me far yesterday ... communicating to our legacy server using ctype (tcp/ip packet protocol)
[07:13] benvie: object properties and all that
[07:14] cosmincx has joined the channel
[07:14] HeikoR: but got stuck for last couple of hours trying to return binary encrypted data from node plugin 
[07:14] benvie: yeah heikor definetely! the best 12 hour oh shit its on fire solution is making the basic commdand line transport do something useful
[07:15] benvie: ok back up
[07:15] benvie: define
[07:15] HeikoR: was considering returning as a UTF8 string and then convert to binary in JS, but would like to get addon to work right - see node::Buffer::new being used, but I can't link to it ? and doesn't seem like its exported for plugins
[07:15] benvie: "return", "encrypted", "data from node", and "plugin"
[07:15] benvie: all of which can mean a lot of things
[07:15] benvie: short answer
[07:16] benvie: I've been using websockets to communicate betweem localhost
[07:16] benvie: find a transport that works
[07:16] benvie: any transport that works for ou
[07:16] benvie: it really doesn't matter for the prototype implementation so don't let that be the defining factor
[07:17] amigojapan has joined the channel
[07:17] HeikoR: * 1) I've got a addon called "customCrypt" or similar
[07:17] benvie: just get the data moving and different stuff talking as easily and quickly as possible
[07:17] HeikoR: * 2) want to call function "encrypt(...)" and get back binary encrypted data
[07:18] benvie: ok
[07:18] HeikoR: *3) how do I get binary data back to JS (using latest node 0.6.0 release)
[07:18] HeikoR: :)
[07:18] benvie: do you know where the specific failure point is
[07:18] benvie: well in js it'd involve a stream and setting the stream to encoding: "binary"
[07:18] HeikoR: *4) can return string from my addon New::String(...), but how do I return binary buffer ?
[07:19] AAA_awright: Anyone else getting an SSL error for GitHub?
[07:19] benvie: and you specifically need to set the writable stream to the desired encoding (in js)
[07:19] benvie: so
[07:19] benvie: streams in Node are defined in JS I believe, now
[07:19] HeikoR: yup but how do I do it in C+=? 
[07:20] asher^ has joined the channel
[07:20] benvie: your simplest/quickest bet is to make a simple version work in JS first
[07:20] HeikoR: What function/class do I use 
[07:20] benvie: them going back to C++
[07:20] benvie: couple things
[07:20] benvie: if you haven't done so already you probably need to read node-pipe-wrap from top to bottom
[07:21] jamiep_ has joined the channel
[07:21] HeikoR: good more reference ! :) - thanx - any reading is good - there's not much info out there 
[07:21] HeikoR: can't find a single windows C++ addon (source code)
[07:21] benvie: and then second, I'm not exactly sure. Quite recently an implementation of conversion from javascript typed array buffers was committed to node
[07:21] svnlto has joined the channel

[07:22] HeikoR: (gotta leave for work in a mo)
[07:23] benvie: tell them there's probably less than the total fingers on your hand of people who've even tried
[07:23] Garo_: is there a summary about the new features in 0.6 when compared to 0.4.12?
[07:23] benvie: it's new
[07:23] benvie: very new

[07:23] jbrokc_ has joined the channel
[07:23] benvie: but yeah quick holy shit my pants are on fire answer
[07:23] benvie: do as much as you can in javascript
[07:24] asher^: hello all
[07:24] benvie: if you'll notice, the majority of node's source is javascript, and this isn't arbitrary
[07:24] HeikoR: @benvie - do you have a webpage ? github ? 
[07:24] HeikoR: And JakeSays ?
[07:25] HeikoR: :)
[07:25] benvie: my glorious site: bbenvie.com (needs to be updated, https://github.com/Benvie, and most of my actual published effort is http://stackoverflow.com/users/748221/brandon-benvie
[07:25] benvie: I have a lot of stuff local I need to publish
[07:26] benvie: I've been working on this chromium/node project for so long
[07:26] HeikoR: yup - I was trying to do the encrypt decrypt in JS (prob possible) but don't wanna go wrong there - and in C++ its a couple of lines and some lib files
[07:26] benvie: and none of it's up anywhere
[07:26] HeikoR: ... and ... its fun (sweat!) to write a C++ addon ;)

[07:28] benvie: that's useful
[07:28] benvie: https://gist.github.com/1337098
[07:28] HeikoR: and JakeSays ?
[07:29] benvie: problem is I keep shooting for perfection instead of "this would be really useful"
[07:29] HeikoR: (so when you planning to release :) )
[07:29] HeikoR: I can relate to perfection
[07:29] benvie: well as you know the windows native stuff is new. I'm going to spend a few days seeing how feasible it is to hit the ideal goal witht hat new toolset
[07:30] benvie: and failing that i'll flal back on what I've been working on, which is useful regardless
[07:30] benvie: as its what you'd use for any sort of remote environment
[07:30] benvie: being able to JSONify the entire javascript context off the bat, and then use @refs from there
[07:31] benvie: so I can do like
[07:31] benvie: gui.send(process)
[07:31] benvie: and it sends the entire structure, cyclic structures, prototypes, and all, with the minimum transport cost
[07:31] benvie: which is instant if you're doing it locally
[07:31] HeikoR:  - like piping display in unix ?
[07:32] asher^: hi guys, im brand new to nodejs. im trying to set it up to run code purely on the server side. do i treat it like a cli program?
[07:32] benvie: or in Chromium, socket.send(window)
[07:32] benvie: no
[07:32] benvie: this is piping a Javascript context
[07:32] hackband has joined the channel
[07:32] cognominal_ has joined the channel
[07:32] benvie: for the goal are having a mirrored structure that puts up a facade of direct access

[07:33] AAA_awright: Are there any good docs for christkv/node-mongodb-native?
[07:33] benvie: and having it late binded to the GUI process behind the scenes
[07:33] HeikoR: ahh 
[07:33] zomg: asher^: you can, yes
[07:33] benvie: but "late" is a relative term when it's local and you've already mirrored the entire context and prototype chain
[07:33] HeikoR: will that improve security ?
[07:33] benvie: absolutely not
[07:33] asher^: zomg cool, at least im looking in the right place :)
[07:34] benvie: everything I do is a security travesty if it were to go remote

[08:02] domino14: i have a question about nodejs and same origin policy. My django server is at beta.example.com. i have a nodejs server at node.example.com. i connect to the node server just through socket.io and it seems to be fine
[08:03] domino14: well, in my case, i'm running locally, my django server is 127.0.0.1:8000 and my node server is some AWS IP at port 3000
[08:03] domino14: i'm not getting any errors and it seems im connected to the socket. is this normal? can i do this in production?
[08:03] benvie: subomdains run afould of the same origin policy while ports do not

[08:04] domino14: and it seems the websocket is open and everything is fine?
[08:05] benvie: oh I saw SOP and thought browsers
[08:05] benvie: that doesn't apply out of browsers (in node) so that's something unrelated
[08:05] bnoordhuis: benvie: i'm pretty sure that the same origin policy also applies to ports
[08:05] domino14: so i can connect to a socket.io server on node.example.com just fine?
[08:05] domino14: that makes me so happy! i cnat get this nginx crap to work
[08:06] benvie: nnnoon the client you're using is the determining factor
[08:06] domino14: firefox?
[08:06] benvie: although socket.io uses various types of transports, some of which like flash which don't abide by the same rles
[08:07] benvie: so
[08:07] domino14: i seem to have no problem with chrome or firefox
[08:07] domino14: those are like 90+% of our users
[08:07] benvie: all browsers that are current abide by same origin policy, but there's a newer protocol for cross-origin sharing which all the new browsers also implement
[08:07] benvie: but it requires server-side cooperation
[08:07] ultramagnus has joined the channel
[08:07] benvie: cross origin resource sharing whatever
[08:08] domino14: my domains are completley different though as i stated. the django server is on localhost, node server is on some aws server, and it's doing fine?
[08:08] benvie: it's a handshake process over http that requires the browser to ask, and then the server to authhorize
[08:09] benvie: yeah the domain doesn't matter, it's whether the servers are configured to accept CORS requests
[08:09] benvie: and whether the browser isn't old IE
[08:09] domino14: i didnt set up any CORS things

[08:10] domino14: i just want it purely for socket.io
[08:10] domino14: can it be lorised/etc
[08:10] benvie: node will handle anything that gets to it
[08:10] benvie: so if you reverse proxy a port to it, it doesn't care
[08:10] benvie: just make sure its getting there

[08:11] benvie: node is close to the metal
[08:11] benvie: you give it a port, it listens, it does its things
[08:12] benvie: it's not like apache or IIS or other stuff that has 18 levels of voodoo magic between the config and reality
[08:13] benvie: so the first assumption in multi-server environments is that the other thing is broken

[16:32] TheJH: lulzilla, in stack traces, it's shown as the files name. doesn't have to be real.
[16:32] MooGoo: does it
[16:32] lulzilla: ok, something like a virtual file name for that virtual code

[17:46] kkaefer: ah, so it doesn't handle back pressure well
[17:46] kenperkins: morning
[17:46] kkaefer: can readstream handle pause/resume?
[17:47] isaacs: willwhite: the fs.ReadStream doesn't put a limit on how much it reads.
[17:47] mmalecki: isaacs: replicetion still fails :(
[17:47] kkaefer: hmm, yeah, doesn't have a pause method it seems
[17:47] isaacs: willwhite: so, if the fs will give it to node in one chunk, then you get one chunk.
[17:47] isaacs: kkaefer: it handles backpressure

[17:48] isaacs: actually, i'm wrong, you can set the buffersize

[17:51] RORgasm: node server kept crashing coz one of the APIs we're using they were having load issues, so i had to resort to this:
[17:51] RORgasm:   process.on("uncaughtException", function(err) {
[17:51] RORgasm:     return console.log("**** UNCaught exception: ***" + JSON.stringify(err));
[17:51] RORgasm:   });
[17:51] RORgasm: oops
[17:51] RORgasm: sorry meant to pastie :)
[17:51] ekryski: isaacs:  I'll look into it. just checking to see if I can manually open it.
[17:51] RORgasm: but yeah i know that's not good practice
[17:52] RORgasm: wonder what everyone is using for monitoring their node apps are running
[17:52] RORgasm: i'm using monit currently
[17:52] mmalecki: isaacs: any ideas about this replications problems?
[17:52] isaacs: mmalecki: nope, sorry
[17:53] willwhite: isaacs: my guess is that a 4 GB file isn't being read in one chunk :)
[17:53] devdazed: RORgasm: why did you let it get to "uncaughtException"?  why couldn't you catch it on the response object?
[17:54] mmalecki: isaacs: thanks anyway :). I will just use replicate and deal with it
[17:54] RORgasm: devdazed: hey...long time no see :)
[17:54] devdazed: RORgasm: yeah, I was in SF for a couple months

[17:55] devdazed: RORgasm: because at that point the server could be in an unstable satte
[17:55] isaacs: what happened to it?
[17:56] isaacs: did it have any outstanding requests to other servers that should be closed or cleaned up?
[17:56] isaacs: was its callback trapping any global state that will now never be cleaned up?
[17:56] devdazed: and by not letting it crash, it could be in some sort of limbo where the process exists but its not accepting connections

[17:56] RORgasm: i mean i'm not really using any global vairables to store anything

[17:57] RORgasm: if that's the concern
[17:57] isaacs: RORgasm: sure, but you'll almost always end up leaking memory
[17:57] RORgasm: oh
[17:57] devdazed: isaacs: yeah, i guess so.
[17:57] RORgasm: really
[17:57] RORgasm: hmm
[17:57] isaacs: not 100% of the time

I'm using a node.js server to execute a subprocess using child_process.exec, but I'm getting permission errors even though the user the node server is running under is a member of a group that should have permission to do read and write the file.  The only thing I can think of is either the subprocess is getting executed as a different

[18:07] broofa: ^^^ this in a little command line utility that's doing basic text stream processing.
[18:07] isaacs: ekryski: what kind of filesystem is it?  are you just on a normal mac or something, or is this on some kind of vm or mounted thingie?
[18:08] ekryski: isaacs: totally vanilla OSX lion

[21:03] coreb: MooGoo: how's that
[21:05] MooGoo: correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure EOF is a state associated with a stream

[21:07] swaj: EOF/EOT is ascii character 4 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-file).  I'm wondering if he did something like client.end("\004", "ascii"); if that would work.
[21:07] swaj: child.end*
[21:08] swaj: if what he's writing to is specifically looking for that control code
[21:08] josephg: sounds easy to try.
[21:09] MooGoo: control characters are non-printing

[21:15] DrHeiter23: trying to scrape a page using nodejs + jsdom, want to scrape paeg after javascript execution is done but I have a feeling it's failing and read on google groups that it could be because the page includes scripts with relative url's so the jsdom env is failing to load them.  Is there a fix to this or better way to approach the issue?
[21:16] EyePulp has joined the channel

[21:20] DrHeiter23: there are some issues with phantomjs
[21:20] MooGoo: dunno if things have changed, but jsdom was unuseably slow last time I tried it
[21:20] DrHeiter23: in a nodejs project needed to do some scraping and was trying to keep it all in nodejs
[21:20] maletor: How can I parse XML in Node.js from an external API call?
[21:20] DrHeiter23: it seems fast, just having this issue
[21:21] MooGoo: just dig into the page a bit
[21:21] swaj: MooGoo: libxmljs isn't going to load up the dom and do the AJAX stuff like a browser would.
[21:21] MooGoo: you should be able to get the data more directly
[21:21] DrHeiter23: yeah im doing that now, it's a bit complicated.. going to try including the absolute src's manually
[21:21] MooGoo: no...but monitoring XHR activity on a web page is easy, so you can just directly request whatever XHR call gets the data you need
[21:22] DrHeiter23: hmm yeah

[22:11] TheJH: mmalecki, what then?
[22:12] mmalecki: TheJH: but I guess everything in German sounds like a war declaration
[22:12] swaj: man, just reading ryah's post on windows node performance... I'm really impressed.  It's damn close to Linux.
[22:12] jbrokc: mmalecki: also found your vim plugin today for digging out node shebangs after I ran into the issue myself. thanks
[22:12] swaj: (and in one case faster)
[22:12] mmalecki: jbrokc: :)
[22:12] TheJH: isaacs, mhm, sounds weird, but sounds like it might be good for coding
[22:12] jbrokc: mmalecki: (i thought you were cheating in the plugin but turns out that's how you're supposed to do it). have you written anything else in VimL?

[22:13] jbrokc: mmalecki: how so?
[22:14] broofa has joined the channel
[22:14] mmalecki: jbrokc: detecting usage of built-in modules and requiring them at the top of the file
[22:14] mmalecki: but that's silly

[22:14] mmalecki: too many edge cases

[22:19] mmalecki: jbrokc: link?
[22:19] jbrokc: mmalecki: so there's a couple of ways to go about it (anyone here who uses javascript in Vim would get benefit from this if they don't know of it already)
[22:20] jbrokc: mmalecki: make sure syntax omnicompletion is turned on by default. type :h ft-syntax-omni    for more details. then just use <C-o> in a javascript (or, now coffeescript with vim-coffeescript) file
[22:20] JKarsrud: what kind of folder structure would you guys recommend for an application that will reuse some of the code for frontend and backend? put it in src or something? 
[22:20] JKarsrud: (using express)
[22:20] tbranyen: i use common
[22:20] mmalecki: jbrokc: does it contain all node.js core methods?
[22:20] jbrokc: mmalecki: for auto-code completion (like, showing you the autocomplete popup automatically) try a plugin link neocomplcache or something. I find them distracting
[22:20] tbranyen: to share between the two
[22:20] jbrokc: sorry, that should have been <C-x> <C-o>
[22:20] jbrokc: mmalecki: oh, no, sorry.
[22:20] mmalecki: jbrokc: yeah, I mean, I know how to do autocomplete
[22:21] jbrokc: mmalecki: whoops ;_;
[22:21] mmalecki: I just want node.js completion :D
[22:21] mmalecki: jbrokc: it's ok :)
[22:21] jbrokc: mmalecki: if you take a look at :e $VIMRUNTIME/autoload/javascriptcomplete.vim and poke around there it shouldn't been too difficult
[22:22] quackquack: SubStack: what does this error mean (from browserify): "Error: Can only load non-root modules in a node_modules directory for file"?

[22:23] tjh: hmm
[22:24] tjh: the recent release shouldn't use it at all
[22:24] swaj: yeah I couldn't find it
[22:24] swaj: I'm wondering if it's one of my requires 
[22:24] tjh: we could easily add filenames/linenos

[22:25] tjh: I'll ask the guys
[22:26] SubStack: jesusabdullah: yep
[22:26] swaj: tjh: yeah it seems to be one of my requires... I just did a fresh express app and it's not showing that warning anymore.  I'll have to dig around.
[22:26] TheJH: ryah, https://github.com/joyent/libuv/issues/206 maybe?
[22:26] SubStack: quackquack: the path rebase step to map to targets really needs moved to when the bundle() happens
[22:26] SubStack: known problem
[22:26] TheJH: ryah, random crashes because of an untranslated error code
[22:26] ryah: ok

[22:32] jerrysv: should see what pull request 239 gets resolved as
[22:32] swaj: express devs, how do you do validation?  I'm using mongoose's validation right now, though I'm getting a bit snagged up on the fact that you can't push multiple custom validators on a schema.  Also, I'd like to write something that can work client-side, but fallback gracefully to server side if the user uses something lame like noscript.

[22:58] tjh: JakeSays just Buffers / data uris / local files
[22:58] JakeSays: ah ok
[22:58] isaacs: rektide: ok.  the problem is that `make install` is failing.
[22:59] isaacs: rektide: it's having problems fetching ronnjs, which it needs to build the docs, which it needs to do since you're installing from the dev source rather than from a release.
[22:59] isaacs: rektide: try this:
[22:59] rektide: isaacs: and it looks like dns is failing to resolve the library
[22:59] rektide: rather, failing to resolve some kind of hostname
[22:59] isaacs: ./configure --prefix=/opt/npm && sudo make latest
[23:00] isaacs: rektide: or, better yet, rather than fetch the source from github, fetch it from the registry.
[23:00] isaacs: ie, http://registry.npmjs.org/npm/-/npm-1.0.104.tgz
[23:01] isaacs: download that, crack it open, and `node cli.js install -gf .
[23:01] isaacs: which is what the install script does
[23:01] rektide: isaacs: http://pastebin.com/v8Fv8FrR was the sudo make latest result
