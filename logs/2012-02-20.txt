[02:24] zackattack: how do you guys like to handle login / user registration?
[02:24] jesusabdullah: and maybe they have some good ideas re: "combine-to-form"
[02:24] jesusabdullah: but that doesn't mean couch is bad, it just means they have some good ideas.
[02:25] stelcheck: actually, all their projects are named couchbase now
[02:25] stelcheck: its just that, for actual couchdb features
[02:25] stelcheck: you still have to wait until 2.0 is out
[02:25] SubStack: zackattack: I like to make an auth server
[02:25] SubStack: and then connect to it from the other services
[02:25] zackattack: an auth server? written in node?
[02:25] SubStack: yep
[02:25] SubStack: just a simple thing that talks to a db
[02:26] SubStack: I use dnode+upnode typically but http requests work fine too
[02:26] SubStack: it keeps your application logic from getting too complicated and makes it easier to tie into your auth db with subsystems you build out later
[02:26] pizthewiz has joined the channel
[02:27] zackattack: hey... that's a pretty cool idea
[02:28] zackattack: loose coupling
[02:28] ohtogo has left the channel
[02:28] zackattack: at what point would i need to use upnode?
[02:29] warz has joined the channel
[02:29] warz has joined the channel
[02:29] SubStack: you can prototype everything with dnode first and it's trivial to add upnode to the mix later
[02:29] SubStack: upnode is great for re-establishing the connections when they go down and it pings the remote end and tries to reconnect regularly
[02:29] r04r has joined the channel
[02:29] kainosnoema has joined the channel
[02:30] zackattack: SubStack:  cool
[02:30] SubStack: and pending transactions get queued while it's reconnecting so your services just hang briefly and then go through again
[02:30] SubStack: a bit like a message queue in that respect, but only for the initial connection
[02:30] cleric: when i put jsdom code in a node.io script why doesnt it work?
[02:30] SubStack: since the transactions are more stateful than message queue topologies tend to be
[02:31] SubStack: zackattack: also if you want to authenticate your services later that is really easy to do with upnode
[02:31] zackattack: how often do the connections go down?
[02:31] zackattack: what do you mean by authenticate my services later?
[02:31] SubStack: zackattack: with our production servers probably a few each day on rackspace
[02:31] SubStack: due to network hiccups
[02:31] zackattack: ohh...
[02:31] zackattack: even if the dnode server is on your local box?
[02:32] SubStack: if everything is local it should be fine
[02:32] zackattack: cool
[02:32] zackattack: yeah i like this idea of decoupling it.  i'll see if i can whip up an experimental app.
[02:32] SubStack: but I mean before I wrote dnode our services would die sporadically and we'd have to restart them
[02:32] ohtogo has joined the channel
[02:32] samuelgoodwin: so I need some sort of storage, I have users who have a list of rss feeds they can add/remove and a list of rss-items that will change status frequently in big batches. What would handle that well?
[02:32] SubStack: *before I wrote upnode
[02:32] zackattack: i guess it would be straightforward to integrate it as middleware later
[02:32] SubStack: but now everything just reconnects as necessary and has been really robust
[02:33] zackattack: how hard would it be to integrate with a session store?
[02:33] SubStack: one benefit of using upnode that you get even when running locally is that you can bring down servers and bring them back up without disrupting service
[02:33] SubStack: since the connections just get queued until the service pops back
[02:35] cleric: how do i run multiple modules in one script?
[02:35] samuelgoodwin: I was thinking redis
[02:35] draginx: what does everyone use for mail? node-pony?

[02:35] SubStack: was using mailer before but it has some bugs and has 0 tests

[02:36] warz: does the github mac client annoy anybody else when it resizes itself while switching between the different tabs?
[02:36] SubStack: draginx: it can be a bit slow on some connections yeah
[02:37] SubStack: we have some other higher priority things in the queue though
[02:37] draginx: rawr
[02:37] zackattack: SubStack:  how hard is it to integrate dnode with a session store?  for example, for persistent auth?
[02:37] zackattack: like a logged-in user..
[02:37] SubStack: draginx: have you tried testling yet?
[02:37] draginx: nope
[02:37] SubStack: you should, super fun times!
[02:38] SubStack: zackattack: there's https://github.com/tblobaum/dnode-session

[02:40] SubStack: zackattack: it uses anything that works with the express session store
[02:40] Revernd has joined the channel
[02:40] SubStack: but also keep in mind that there's dnode that works server to server and dnode for server to browser
[02:41] zackattack: dnode for server to browser?

[02:41] Emmanuel` has joined the channel
[02:41] SubStack: server to browser is what dnode-session addresses
[02:42] SubStack: using websockets
[02:42] zackattack: insane..
[02:42] SubStack: zackattack: also if you want more crazy related tech to play with check out seaport and airport
[02:42] SubStack: service registries for your clusters!
[02:43] SubStack: and airport is just a more convenient api for connecting and serving upnode services through seaport
[02:43] SubStack: I blogged about it here http://substack.net/posts/7a1c42/semver-your-services-with-seaport
[02:43] zackattack: jeez wow
[02:44] SubStack: the crazy part is that you can spin up new services with particular versions and only connect to certain semvered ranges
[02:44] SubStack: just like the dependencies field in package.json, but for network services!

[04:25] timoxley: need to make a function 'block' while it completes an atomic sequence of async operations. I'm thinking the best way to handle this is to queue any incoming requests. Is that how people normally handle this?
[04:26] SubStack: zackattack: and make sure too that if you run that in production then random IPs can't connect to it and start monkeying about
[04:26] jkridner_ has joined the channel
[04:26] SubStack: you can bolt that on later pretty easily with upnode however
[04:27] maxogden: timoxley: just callback the response once the async operations are finished. you dont need to queue other requests, the node can handle many concurrent connections
[04:27] SubStack: just check out the upnode authenticated example from the readme for a simple approach

[04:29] SubStack: yeah you can with dnode but it's much easier to connect to an authenticated server with upnode since it takes care of the initialization

[05:21] davidbanham: aashay: Blergh. I use bcrypt in a production app. I guess I'd better avoid deleting my local installation
[05:22] aashay: davidbanham: yeah don't touch it, I made the mistake of upgrading my local npm modules today and I've been hosed ever since
[05:23] davidbanham: aashay: Just installed it in a local directory to test and it seems to have gone okay. Deprecation warnings, but waf exited successfully.
[05:23] maxogden: davidbanham: i use request for rest all the time

[05:26] maxogden: davidbanham: if you are talking about html form submissions yes but that doesnt have anything to do with POST specifically, body is just a string

[05:54] zackattack: oh, i wasn't using .listen(app), since my dnode server is a separate application.
[05:54] Xtrivity: Hey all, I am just about to start playing around with JS. As i plan on buying a dedi after I have developed it locally I am wondering what flavor of linux most people are using to run the nodejs server on
[05:54] SubStack: well there you go
[05:54] SubStack: zackattack: so here's how it works
[05:54] Octayn: Xtrivity: I've used everything from LFS to Debian Stable
[05:54] SubStack: you .listen(port) to listen on a port over tcp to other node processes
[05:54] SubStack: you .listen(app) to listen on an http server to connect to browser clients
[05:54] SubStack: different things
[05:55] Xtrivity: Octayn is ubuntu alright? I have been using centos on a few of my dedicateds, but deems to be a bit of a pain to install on the latest centos 6.2
[05:55] Octayn: Xtrivity: ubuntu server is just fine
[05:55] zackattack: so... to make the browser talk to a node process on tcp port 5050... ?
[05:56] SubStack: zackattack: you can't do that directly
[05:56] SubStack: browsers are stupid
[05:56] zackattack: right
[05:56] zackattack: how do i route the request inside my app then?
[05:56] SubStack: you've got to .listen(app)
[05:56] zackattack: done.
[05:56] Xtrivity: Octayn: ubuntu desktop work? Just noticed that the server flavor costs a bit of coin
[05:56] zackattack: then?
[05:56] Octayn: Xtrivity: No it doesn't, ubuntu server is free
[05:56] zackattack: or i guess i could put my server in an external file and just export it
[05:56] zackattack: and then listen that way, so i'm only running one server?
[05:56] SubStack: yes that's a good approach
[05:57] SubStack: you can also .listen() using the same instance on an app and a port
[05:57] Octayn: Xtrivity: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server/download
[05:57] SubStack: .listen(app).listen(port)
[05:57] zackattack: ah, ok
[05:57] SubStack: if you want tcp connections to have the same access as browser connections
[05:57] Octayn: Xtrivity: you'll probably want the LTS, you can compile node easily

[06:20] SubStack: I made a gist
[06:20] mikeal: a TON of code got ripped apart on master
[06:20] mikeal: can you link me to the gist

[06:22] mappum: Does node always slowly rise in memory usage (is it the v8 gc?) or do I have a leak?
[06:22] mikeal: you know what that is, it's me being fucking stupid and thinking i didn't already do something i already did
[06:22] mikeal: when  i did the refactor i implemented a write chunk in end and forgot i was already using .apply on end

[06:23] SubStack: aha
[06:23] mikeal: SubStack: fixed
[06:23] SubStack: sweet
[06:24] zackattack: SubStack:  is it standard for it to take 11 seconds for the DNode.connect() event to fire?
[06:24] r04r has joined the channel
[06:25] SubStack: zackattack: negatory, usually it's pretty fast
[06:25] SubStack: but it could be socket.io being ridiculous?
[06:25] zackattack: that's totally possible..
[06:25] SubStack: socket.io is kind of ridiculous
[06:26] zackattack: it hooks in to socket.io, eh?
[06:26] SubStack: I need to swap it out for engine.io and/or socksjs
[06:27] zackattack: uh oh
[06:27] zackattack: plan on doing it in the near future?
[06:28] SubStack: zackattack: what about when you run the example, is it still as slow?
[06:28] SubStack: when I run the example/web-express it fires pretty much immediately
[06:28] SubStack: on chrome

[06:31] zackattack: SubStack:  augh, i can't install 'dnode' inside the dnode (git proj) directory?
[06:31] zackattack: "npm install dnode" does nothing
[06:31] SubStack: zackattack: just require('../../')
[06:31] SubStack: or mkdir node_modules in examples/ or examples/web-express
[06:31] SubStack: then npm install dnode
[06:32] SubStack: or make a symlink to the parent or however

[06:36] SubStack: node bin/bundle.js
[06:37] zackattack: ah
[06:37] zackattack: i got it working, but it doesn't fire immediately...
[06:38] zackattack: so since it's a window.onload, it doesn't fire at all.
[06:38] zackattack: err

[06:38] SubStack: maybe the readyState is already 'complete'?
[06:38] zackattack: yeah, SubStack , the DNode.connect() event takes about 10 seconds to fire... even in your example.
[06:39] SubStack: you could use $(document).ready() if you throw jquery in there

[06:41] SubStack: crap, that probably means it's some node version of library range issue
[06:42] SubStack: I guess that's better than it being some browser bug

[06:52] SubStack: and I tested against 0.4.12 and 0.6.10
[06:52] SubStack: and they both fire right away
[06:52] SubStack: I could build 0.5.0-pre with give but it might take away
[06:52] SubStack: *take awhile
[06:52] SubStack: I'm on ubuntu here too
[06:52] SubStack: 64 bit

[06:57] SubStack: if you npm install -g nave
[06:57] SubStack: you can just nave install $version
[06:57] SubStack: https://github.com/isaacs/nave

[07:41] xeodox: thanks.
[07:41] Octayn: Xtrivity: How did you install them?
[07:42] xeodox: Does anyone know the performance of Large vs Small for Node.js?
[07:42] Xtrivity: Octayn npm install socket.io (in the node folder)
[07:42] Xtrivity: same with express as well.
[07:42] Octayn: xeodox: the obvious performance increases you'd expect from having more cpu and memory
[07:43] Octayn: Xtrivity: you need to run 'npm install' from the directory you will be running your program from

[07:43] xeodox: Octayn: thanks. right now I have mysql, web (node.js), and image-resizing (node.js) server on 3 different Smalls.  Do you know if I would get better performance with 1 large that does all 3 of those things?
[07:43] Octayn: Xtrivity: so for example, I would 'cd ~/hacking/miniblog; npm install express'
[07:43] Xtrivity: Octayn ill give it a shot

[07:44] xeodox: Octayn:  I have everything indexed correctly in Mysql. I also utilized Redis for caching correctly. I'm basically fetching from memory all the time, and it's still slow. 
[07:44] xeodox: Octayn: how do I profile? I installed node-profile but it didn't work. Is that the only way?

[07:51] xeodox: In general, what does profiling tell me anyway? (How long each function takes? or what? )
[07:51] Xtrivity: Octayn: if i go off of: http://socket.io/#how-to-use the second layer down where it shows server (app.js) and client (index.html).. and i am running the server in my vm.. am i not using index.html to connect locally (outside of the vm)
[07:51] Octayn: xeodox: Yes, exactly that
[07:51] wink_ has joined the channel
[07:51] Octayn: xeodox: so you know which functions are slowest, so you know what needs improving
[07:52] Morkel has joined the channel
[07:52] Octayn: Xtrivity: not sure I understand your question
[07:52] Xtrivity: on the link sent there's both a server side and client side file.. app.js is server (running in my vm) and client (i am assumign runs outside of the vm to connect)
[07:53] r04r has joined the channel
[07:53] Octayn: The client would be served by an httpd to be used by the browser
[07:53] Hanspolo has joined the channel
[07:53] Xtrivity: so it requires something like xampp or apache as opposed to .html file
[07:54] Octayn: node has an http server
[07:54] Octayn: you're running it by using express
[07:54] Xtrivity: Octayn im gonna pm so i dont get booted, i need to copy and paste to make sense of what im saying
[07:54] Octayn: Xtrivity: use a pastebin, I have PM's disabled on the server
[07:54] Xtrivity: sure
[07:55] tonist has joined the channel
[07:55] Xtrivity: Octayn: http://pastebin.com/zTCAPR4K so it says <script> and asks for the socket.io.js... a) where do i get that from if that is being run client side (assumign outside of my vm)
[07:55] xeodox: Octayn:  Thanks. I'm going to profile it later tonight. Off the top of your head, do you know if switching from my 3 small servers to 1 large would make any difference in speed?
[07:55] Octayn: Xtrivity: you don't "get" it from anywhere, it comes with socket.io
[07:56] Octayn: xeodox: It really depends on a lot of things. If inter-server communication is slowing things down a lot, then probably.
[07:57] Octayn: Xtrivity: put that in an index.html
[07:57] niloy has joined the channel
[07:57] Xtrivity: Octayn: Where. When i try the example node app.js, it runs but where do i edit the index.html file 
[07:58] xeodox: Oh I forgot to mention I have an API server . The web server hits the API server like 20 times (via REST) using the internal EC2 IP for each request .  So thats actually 4 small servers :)

[07:58] Xtrivity: Octayn I have a feeling i'm not understanding this all the way i should be, it's frustrating. By the looks of it, app.js is what runs server side.. the index.html runs clientside... but you're saying that socket.io.js and the index.html file is generated by socket.io but where and how ?
[07:59] Octayn: Xtrivity: That's the magic of it :)
[07:59] Octayn: Xtrivity: express is a server framework
[07:59] Octayn: Xtrivity: socket.io uses it to serve the files

[08:00] Xtrivity: Is index.html client or server side?
[08:00] Wizek has joined the channel
[08:00] Octayn: It is stored on the server. The browser loads and runs it.
[08:00] Xtrivity: if it's client side.. where the **** do i get the socket/socket.io/js client file (as there's no showing of it in on the server being generated by node

[08:21] eddyb: Xtrivity: can you run the web server with node?

[08:22] Xtrivity: Well right now i'll take for example ANY example to do with socket.io and when i try to connect to it via browser direct web address (the ip of the VM) it just says "welcome to socket.io"

[08:23] eddyb: it should be a js file
[08:24] Xtrivity: Correct, I am able to open that.
[08:24] eddyb: Xtrivity: the question is, do you want to have the web server ran from the same node process that runs your socket.io server?
[08:25] izepstan has joined the channel
[08:25] Xtrivity: I'm not entirely sure. I have a dedicated web server that runs apache... i am just wanting to use socket.io and node to build a chat like system. If it requires a webserver in itself to do that, then yes i want to run from the socket.io server
[08:26] eddyb: if you do, you can have an web server and a socket.io server on the same port

[08:28] Xtrivity: eddyb I am running node on a completely different server than the apache server I run as it would be too many resources on one machine.
[08:29] Xtrivity: So on that note: should I should keep express as the webserver should I not? 
[08:29] eddyb: it doesn't make much sense, a node webserver would be quite cheap, but anyway
[08:29] eddyb: all you need is to load http://192.168.216.130:1337/socket.io/socket.io.js
[08:29] eddyb: in the client html
[08:29] Xtrivity: Also after going to that link you gave me and ran it... when i go to the browser it says: "cannot get/"
[08:30] eddyb: you don't have the client, index.html

[08:42] SubStack: :(
[08:42] zackattack: =(
[08:42] SubStack: maybe this is a bug that socket.io fixes in a newer build
[08:42] zackattack: hopefully.
[08:42] SubStack: I can't replicate it though
[08:42] zackattack: well, i decided to stop using it
[08:43] zackattack: i'm just using socket.io now
[08:43] zackattack: but i still had it abstracted to a "server"
[08:43] zackattack: so, :)
[08:43] SubStack: you can still use dnode for server to server communication
[08:43] zackattack: totally
[08:44] zackattack: definitely a great piece of plumbing

[08:45] Xtrivity: eddyb: Thanks! Last quick question. If i already have an apache server running my website, All i should need is a socket.io server should i not? This is where I get a bit confused
[08:46] eddyb: yes
[08:46] eddyb: unless you want a full node.js webserver
[08:46] Xtrivity: Okay, on that note: i can't seem to get connectivity to the socket.io connection (current test setup: node.js / socket.io server on vm + non VM with apache web server installed)

[09:08] Xtrivity: eddyb: v0.5.11-pre

[09:21] Xtrivity: timoxley: i'm running npm version: 1.0.106. What would be the best way to update node or how do i install nvm

[09:21] eddyb: Xtrivity: ubuntu 11.10?
[09:22] Xtrivity: ubutn 10.04 server
[09:22] eddyb: 10.04 is quite old, too
[09:22] timoxley: Xtrivity I'd just do: `npm install -g n && n 0.6.11`
[09:23] Xtrivity: yeah but it's recommended.

[09:26] Xtrivity: but trying to get the technology to work for dev deems to be a challenge in itself
[09:26] eddyb: why don't you use your dedi
[09:27] Xtrivity: eddyb my dedi is a webserver.
[09:27] Xtrivity: I have to buy a secondary dedi.

[09:28] hipsterslapfight: *nginx
[09:28] eddyb: node.js uses a few MBs of RAM
[09:28] Xtrivity: hipsters1apfight, my company would never allow me to run both on one server.

[09:29] rendar: this lightness of node.js is made by google v8?
[09:30] eddyb: rendar: yeah
[09:30] rendar: cool..
[09:30] timoxley: Xtrivity they would never let you run nginx + node at the some time?

[09:30] Xtrivity: eddyb development.
[09:31] eddyb: I haven't been able to properly develop anything on windows
[09:31] Xtrivity: I dont have a secondary dedi yet, and the first dedi is used for mainstream applications, can't be tampered.
[09:31] Xtrivity: eddyb, when it's web languages and web apps, it's pretty simple on windows.

[09:49] eddyb: then there's no point in changing to express unless you want to recode all that PHP
[09:50] Benin: eddyb:does any app use C#.

[09:51] Benin: thanks all.
[09:51] ningu: C# seems preferable to C++ to me, but I guess on *nix there isn't much point
[09:51] Xtrivity: eddyb, but index.html is stil client side. I wouldn't essentially have to re-write any of the php code at all, i'd just be connecting to that solely for chat

[09:54] Xtrivity: eddyb: If I had an application like facebook running on an apache/php server and i were to create a chat system. I know that the express webserver is directly connected to socket.io/node js server. Would connecting to express using a client index.html be faster or would be it be faster to jsut connect directly to the websocket server using socket.io ?
[09:54] eddyb: lol
[09:54] Xtrivity: Do you get what I mean?
[09:54] eddyb: express just serves the client stuff

[10:50] ToTheInternet: Hi. I don't know an awful lot about node.js, other than reading about it every now and then. From what I know so far, it seems it may be perfect for the application I am planning. I was hoping I could get some oppinions here, if it is indeed suited for my app and if it is worth digging into
[10:50] mansoor has joined the channel
[10:50] ToTheInternet: The application is a browser based poker client that interacts with a server. People can join tables and play against each other.
[10:51] ToTheInternet: There are 6-10 players at each table, and there are many tables. Players can sit at more than one table.

[10:52] ToTheInternet: It would seem, that an event driven architecture is very well suited for this. On top, from what I understand, it is possible to write distributed MVC applications with javascript and node.js, where the View and Controller reside in the client, and the model resides on the server
[10:52] chjj: ToTheInternet: you probably wont find many unbiased opinions here
[10:52] ToTheInternet: Seems like a perfect fit
[10:52] chjj: ToTheInternet: but it sounds like you need a healthy dose of socket.io
[10:53] snuggl: ToTheInternet: any language will do fine
[10:53] Octayn: Yep
[10:53] snuggl: ToTheInternet: event-driven is nice, but node isnt the only event driven serverframework
[10:53] chjj: ToTheInternet: use node if you like the language and the api
[10:54] ToTheInternet: not sure if i like the language. i haven't looked into other event driven frameworks, this is all kind of new to me
[10:55] ToTheInternet: coming from the php world, so i have naturally written some javascript 
[10:56] braoru has joined the channel
[10:56] r04r has joined the channel
[10:57] ToTheInternet: what seems so nice to me is the fact that javascript runs directly in the clients browser, and i assume since node.js uses server side javascript, communication will be very clean and easy
[10:57] Octayn: ToTheInternet: another things to consider would be Python with twisted or tornado
[10:57] snuggl: or gevent
[10:57] Octayn: Isn't that the one that uses greenlets?
[10:58] Octayn: yeah, I didn't like that one
[10:58] snuggl: ToTheInternet: it will be cleaner and nicer for the developer, it will be invisible to the actual users

[16:05] bradleymeck: .pipe*
[16:05] Gloorian: timoxley: yes, but what is the other function to get it back ?

[16:06] timoxley: Gloorian then JSON.parse
[16:07] Gloorian: oh, thank  you :D

[17:37] CrisO: vdemedes: cool, thanks
[17:37] RLa: jgautier, can't find anything about it in node, but you can execute mkfifo command yourself
[17:37] RLa: other than that, the file should work as usual file
[17:37] jgautier: gotchya
[17:37] sigurding: vdemedes: I am also fine
[17:38] vdemedes: sigurding: great! :-)
[17:38] jgautier: would there be an advantage of doing the named pipe or just doing a file watch?
[17:38] paulwe has joined the channel
[17:38] jgautier: i would just be using this for unit tests
[17:38] sigurding: started using formaline and got some stuff running, though I do not understand some things

[17:39] vdemedes: sigurding: progress bar problem?
[17:39] tmcw_ has joined the channel
[17:39] RLa: jgautier, not sure how you could do it with file watch
[17:40] sigurding: vdemedes: exactly yes. As I see, I need to open a socket, right? But what would be the appropriate client side? JQuery-UI with progress bar?
[17:40] vdemedes: sigurding: nope, jQuery's UI has nothing to do with that
[17:40] vdemedes: sigurding: this is just UI element
[17:40] johnhamelink: timoxley, if you could write a response on my stackoverflow, I'd love you forever and ever ^_^ I need to go to some crappy meeting now!
[17:41] jgautier: i see that they added support for FIFOs but i dont see any docs http://blog.nodejs.org/2011/07/22/node-v0-5-2/
[17:41] vdemedes: sigurding: I'm having such dirty idea: when upload comes, listen to the progress event(on the server) and keep progress values in the separate array
[17:41] joshkehn has joined the channel
[17:41] timoxley: johnhamelink response up.
[17:41] vdemedes: sigurding: you know what? Socket.io would be perfect for that

[17:41] sigurding: vdemedes: thought of that too
[17:41] joshkehn has left the channel
[17:42] vdemedes: sigurding: just connect to the channel, and emit progress event
[17:42] sigurding: I think i found something like that
[17:42] vdemedes: sigurding: that will be hassle-free
[17:42] sigurding: one sec.
[17:42] vdemedes: sigurding: yep, sure
[17:42] jamescarr: this might sound silly, but is there anyway to have express set default locals?
[17:42] sigurding: vdemedes: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5323291/node-formidable-and-a-simple-progress-bar
[17:43] jamescarr: for example, i want every page to have the title set if  it isn't already
[17:43] RLa: jgautier, they work as normal files
[17:43] RLa: no special support is needed
[17:43] RLa: i think there stats.isFIFO() method, that might be all support it needs :)
[17:44] vdemedes: sigurding: yep, exactly what I'm saying. And what is the problem?
[17:44] vdemedes: sigurding: Socket.io + formidable/formaline
[17:44] sigurding: vdemedes: the client side. how do I connect to exactly this socket and no other?
[17:45] EhevuTov has joined the channel
[17:45] vdemedes: sigurding: there should be only one socket server, you connect to it, and server sends events to the client using session's id
[17:45] vdemedes: sigurding: however, I've worked with socket.io long time ago, don't know how things go now

[20:03] maxogden: axscode: the syntax is "git checkout TAGNAME", where TAGNAME comes from https://github.com/joyent/node/tags
[20:03] maxogden: wereHamster: its called learning, people do it sometimes

[20:04] Aria: Yes.
[20:04] khrome has joined the channel
[20:04] Aria: HEAD in git is just a pointer to the 'current' commit.
[20:04] axscode: clever
[20:04] maxogden: axscode: yeah well maintained repositories use tags to manage releases
[20:04] Aria: When you check something out, it moves the pointer to it, and then updates your working tree to match.
[20:05] maxogden: axscode: so you can just jump around to different tags from inside your repo
[20:05] axscode: ic, but basically you downloaded already all sources?
[20:05] Aria: tags are named references to certain commits.
[20:05] Aria: Yes.
[20:05] axscode: ahh, a total clone..
[20:05] Aria: You can be a little selective, but in git, downloading a commit implies getting at least all of its ancestor commits too.
[20:05] axscode: thats sharing...
[20:05] Aria: So most of the time, that's everything not experimental.

[22:28] Phoenixz: jaw187: forever also can daemonize?
[22:28] jaw187: phoenixz: forever runs as a deamon

[22:31] qbit_: anyone have any recommendations for documenation stuff? ( like beautiful-docs )
[22:31] caolanm: it's not important if it's 5 or 25 other than IE taking longer than the interval to process it

[22:53] mmalecki: nickdc: that warning means that it works
[22:53] nickdc: oh weird. I wonder why it would be doing this then.

[23:07] attilagyorffy: oh i think i know what you mean there
[23:07] attilagyorffy: let me have a try
[23:07] attilagyorffy: so essentially i am going to export User as a whole, right?
[23:07] attilagyorffy: rather than just its methods as an object
[23:08] mmalecki: attilagyorffy: yeah, and then do User.find = function () ...
[23:08] attilagyorffy: great
