[00:01] context: wizek: ahh. so is he saying manually calling a request and expresso calling a request gives different output
[00:01] context: wizek: id imagine there has to be something different in the request
[00:01] Vertice: give me a proper for loop without having to massage your builtins, ffs. =)
[00:01] aaronblohowiak: isaacs: i have gathered a several MB dump of _changes feed data over a few days to help me do some testing on npm alerts
[00:01] isaacs: oh, nice!!
[00:01] Vertice: also, the project i was on had weird issues with hbs installed via ndistro
[00:01] gmonnerat has left the channel
[00:02] Vertice: it would lose parts of the handlebars api
[00:02] aaronblohowiak: isaacs: i have not found any password or account data, but i want to verify that it should be "safe" to share that with the world
[00:02] isaacs: aaronblohowiak: if you got it off the _changes feed, it's already public :)
[00:02] Vertice: if and for are different things, yet have the same syntax
[00:02] Vertice: wtf
[00:02] aaronblohowiak: isaacs: right, so it *should* be good, just wanted to be a good netizen and double-check
[00:02] Vertice: basically, handlebars == do not want.
[00:02] isaacs: thanks :)

[00:05] aaronblohowiak: isaacs: to make npm alerts more generally useful, I am thinking about conceptualizing each package as an EventEmitter that can emit semver-approved major/minor/point/patch events... this should let us add "build_failed"
[00:05] aaronblohowiak: then, users can subscribe via HTTP postback, email, or email_digest to these events

[00:14] tbranyen: Vertice: whats your beef with handlebars?
[00:14] tbranyen: been using mustache for a long time
[00:14] tbranyen: was thinking of switching to handlebars
[00:14] Vertice: my beef is with moustache too
[00:14] Vertice: it required too much pre-processing of data.
[00:15] tbranyen: well some would argue thats how it should be
[00:15] tbranyen: templates should be as simplistic as possible
[00:15] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[00:15] tbranyen: little to no logic
[00:15] Vertice: not buying it
[00:15] Vertice: but it also pissed me off that it didnt know the difference between if and for
[00:16] Vertice: i couldnt easily do 'if (array not empty) {' <markup> 'foreach (items) { ' <li>blah</li> '} </markup> '  } '
[00:17] Vertice: because the {{{#var}}} isnt smart enough to realize the difference
[00:17] Vertice: handlebars DID add the if and each
[00:17] Vertice: block helpers
[00:17] Vertice: but on the project i was on they mysteriously stopped working
[00:18] Vertice: and the fact that it doesnt put the index of what you are iterating through into the scope 
[00:18] JoshC1 has joined the channel
[00:18] Vertice: and the fact that it has byzantine requirements for calling functions (or helpers as it calls them)
[00:19] Vertice: so it doesnt like iterating through hashes, and i have to reconfigure everything from { key: value } to [ {key: key, value: value} ]
[00:19] Vertice: you know what, those arrays i generate, they are from iterating over hashes in the first place
[00:19] andi5 has left the channel
[00:20] andi5 has joined the channel
[00:20] Vertice: so it really just caused endless additional wasted iterations over the data to make it get to a point where it might be able to render things how i want to

[00:21] aaronblohowiak: lol
[00:21] Vertice: yeah. i ended up taking 2 days to rewrite the bulk of the site in jade
[00:21] tmpvar: lol
[00:21] Vertice: i have plenty of hate
[00:21] Vertice: =)
[00:21] tbranyen: Vertice: i'd love to see a template engine that is fast, extendable, but out of the box basic as shit
[00:21] jerrysv: so do i :) i like weld
[00:21] Vertice: anyway. i removed about 1000 lines of code 
[00:22] tbranyen: jerrysv: weld is that?
[00:22] Vertice: because we had attempted to write a generic 'table theme function'
[00:22] Bonuspunkt has joined the channel
[00:22] Vertice: which involved massaging data to work with our crazy straw contraption meant to massage data into what handlebars wanted

[00:22] tmpvar: weld!
[00:22] tmpvar: example page coming tomorrow
[00:22] jerrysv: just not as performant as i'd like
[00:22] brownies has joined the channel
[00:22] Vertice: i'm still hesitant bout weld
[00:23] tbranyen: jerrysv: i'd rather not have a jsdom dependancy
[00:23] tbranyen: also i don't like tying content to selectors
[00:23] tbranyen:  /dom elements
[00:23] tbranyen: especially if i want to use the template engine for code generation
[00:24] Vertice: they may be cheap and dirty, but hell underscore's templates have helped me out of a pinch a few times
[00:24] tbranyen: yeah with a dependancy on underscore
[00:24] Vertice: i already have it anyway
[00:24] tbranyen: hard to find solid stand alone template engines
[00:24] tmpvar: use resigs microtemplating thing
[00:24] Vertice: it's already built in
[00:24] jerrysv: tbranyen: write one?
[00:25] jerrysv: ACTION is actually being serious this time
[00:25] tbranyen: jerrysv: was thinking about writing one that matches mustache syntax but is extendable
[00:25] tbranyen: i hate <%= %> syntax
[00:25] tbranyen: reminds me of php too much
[00:25] jerrysv: or jsp
[00:25] tmpvar: asp
[00:25] jerrysv: yech
[00:25] Vertice: yeah
[00:25] tbranyen: django templates are cool, but not resuable at all, i want something written in JS that is portable
[00:25] Vertice: it's kind of like the work horse of templating

[00:26] willwhit_ has joined the channel
[00:27] Vertice: i did enjoy jade, and i still find it really easy to maintain those
[00:27] Vertice: but i'm doing more client side work these days
[00:28] Vertice: so the need for a universal solution is there
[00:28] tbranyen: yeah mustache is the most portable solution i know of
[00:29] tbranyen: also i'm liking the idea of {={something}=} to differeniate between a legit {{ and the start of an actual template tag
[00:29] Vertice: i've also used underscore with mustache style identifiers

[00:34] Vertice: it's not readily available, and feels hackish
[00:34] Vertice: plus, the rest of the team arent fond of it
[00:35] Vertice: they are threatening to go with dust - http://akdubya.github.com/dustjs/
[00:36] mikey_p: they're all still handlebars?
[00:36] mikey_p: I wish I had time to talk to them about stuff at nodeconf
[00:36] tbranyen: handlebars are great
[00:36] tbranyen: any brackets are good at denoting
[00:36] tbranyen: handlebars just seem to be more ubiquitous and relatable
[00:36] Vertice: we're using underscore.js these days
[00:37] Vertice: i just feel like we're doomed to re-invent smarty
[00:37] tbranyen: Vertice: wish you could define functions to be called for dynamic properties
[00:37] tbranyen: doesn't seem possible in dust
[00:37] mikey_p: i really want to play with bones more but i'm not really into couch or handlebars, and it seems hard to use without those
[00:38] Vertice: i really fail to see how {{#blah}} is supposed to be more understandable than {{ if (blah) : }}
[00:38] Vertice: especially to the supposed 'non programmer designers' who are going to edit your scripts

[00:38] tbranyen: {%if blah%} ... {%endif%}
[00:38] tbranyen: i think django has it right
[00:38] tbranyen: in that regard
[00:38] Vertice: one is almost english, the other is rapidly expanding magic syntax
[00:39] SubStack: I would rather not have a special language embedded inside of templates
[00:39] tbranyen: Vertice: https://gist.github.com/994418
[00:39] Vertice: yeah, i also recommended people use <? if (blah) : ?> <? endif; ?> in their phptemplate templates for drupal
[00:39] tbranyen: slowly fleshing out my wishlist
[00:39] SubStack: just use javascript, everybody already knows it and it's powerful and fully featured
[00:39] SubStack: fuck these mythical "designers"
[00:39] SubStack: they can learn javascript too
[00:39] tbranyen: I don't believe in mythical designers, i believe in the separation of concerns
[00:40] rick_h_: exactly, why I <3 mako in python land
[00:40] SubStack: probably easier to teach them javascript than to teach them an entirely new custom language
[00:40] tbranyen: and it concerns me that someone would pick javascript syntax which is incredibly non portable to languages like python or ruby and breaks the conventions
[00:40] adnam: SubStack: rather, they should not be editing code
[00:40] SubStack: yeah that too
[00:40] jaw6 has joined the channel
[00:40] Vertice: i liked json-template from google
[00:40] Vertice: http://json-template.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/Introducing-JSON-Template.html
[00:41] adnam: and if you have a front end dev that does mostly html/css then you should expect him to grasp at least conditionals and loops in any language
[00:41] Vertice: yeah
[00:42] Vertice: apparently they figured out what the novice drupal themers were having trouble with was data structures, not conditionals
[00:42] adnam: and that's helpful even if the programmer writes both app code and view code, what's exposed in the view should be dead simple to use
[00:42] jmoyers: endlessly reinventing template languages
[00:42] Vertice: they didnt understand arrays and objects
[00:42] mikey_p: one of the big feedbacks that i've been hearing from designers lately is that data structures in templates is waay more confusing that logic
[00:42] yukihr has joined the channel
[00:42] Vertice: yah
[00:42] Vertice: that
[00:42] mikey_p: yeah that
[00:42] mikey_p: ;)(
[00:42] adnam: hmm
[00:43] Vertice: but really. i find myself in a situation where the only people who will be editing these templates are other developers in our company
[00:43] tbranyen: jmoyers: well if i could find one that works outside of html, has simplistic semantics, is portable outside of JS, is incredibly basic out of the box, and has the ability to extend with what i need programmatically
[00:43] tbranyen: ^^ if that could be found, i wouldn't even consider writing something that does all that
[00:43] Vertice: why the hell should we need to limit our tools to the lowest common denominator
[00:44] tbranyen: because its not a programming language, its a template
[00:44] tbranyen: it represents data, it doesn't create it
[00:44] reid has joined the channel
[00:44] jerrysv: out of here for now, nice to see the templating discussion still going :)
[00:44] tbranyen: :D
[00:44] jmoyers: tbranyen: whats wrong with mustache for instance?
[00:44] tbranyen: jmoyers: well the issue i had with that was its not extendable
[00:44] jmoyers: its got an implementation in every language anyone cares about
[00:44] adnam: Vertice: sure, but you still have all the expressive power you need in the app, it's just simplified before being shown in the view
[00:44] tbranyen: i can't create filters
[00:44] tbranyen: to add to its limitations
[00:44] adnam: if you're doing complicated stuff in the view you haven't separated correctly
[00:44] Vertice: i didnt want to spend my life bowing to it's whims
[00:45] jmoyers: the point IS that its limited
[00:45] tbranyen: adnam: exactly, but sometimes you absolutely could use a filter in the template
[00:45] tbranyen: jmoyers: correct
[00:45] adnam: tbranyen: "filter"?
[00:45] jmoyers: meaning
[00:45] tbranyen: adnam: check out django templates and any other implementations that have filters
[00:45] jmoyers: :sass (some sass goes here)
[00:45] JustCute has joined the channel
[00:45] tbranyen: its a common templating term
[00:45] boogyman has joined the channel
[00:45] adnam: like a HOF?
[00:45] jmoyers: like a filter
[00:45] jmoyers: see jade
[00:45] tbranyen: jmoyers: there are times when i need to iterate an object and have access to keys and values
[00:45] jmoyers: same concept
[00:45] adnam: :_(
[00:45] Vertice: yeah
[00:46] Vertice: i was using json-schema
[00:46] Vertice: so i'd have the objects, and the schema
[00:46] jmoyers: i dont know man
[00:46] jmoyers: loops are one things
[00:46] jmoyers: iterating over an 'object'
[00:46] tbranyen: jmoyers: i agree with you thats why i want one that *is* barebones like mustache
[00:46] Vertice: which would require me to iterate over all of them to generate fucking classes.
[00:46] tbranyen: i just want the extendability
[00:46] Vertice: and odd  / even for rows
[00:46] tbranyen: and not having ridiculous syntax like Vertice was saying
[00:46] tbranyen: {#means nothing}
[00:46] tbranyen: to anyone
[00:47] jmoyers: thats ruby string interpolation
[00:47] Vertice: i added a very simple 'filter' helper, that i could pass the field type in from the schema on printing
[00:47] jmoyers: its familiar to those cats
[00:47] adnam: okay, yeah, i see the use of filters
[00:47] jmoyers: you know
[00:47] jmoyers: _.template
[00:47] jmoyers: you define the interpolation syntax
[00:47] jmoyers: i like that feature
[00:47] Vertice: so filter (fieldvalue, schema.properties[fieldname]) 
[00:48] jmoyers: _.templateSettings = {
[00:48] jmoyers:     interpolate : /\{(.+?)\}/g
[00:48] jmoyers: };
[00:48] Vertice: instead of having to do that hundreds of times before you even print the field once, just to massage the data
[00:48] jmoyers: or whatnot
[00:48] Vertice: yeah
[00:48] tbranyen: jmoyers: that could be really awesome, the ability to extend the templating engine is awesome
[00:48] Vertice: i used that to make it look like handlebars
[00:48] jmoyers: beyond that
[00:48] Vertice: so the simple templates were portable
[00:48] jmoyers: if you get into heavy data structures
[00:48] jmoyers: i think it starts sucking huge ass
[00:48] tbranyen: well thats when filters come to play
[00:48] jmoyers: and just use the language, like php's short forms, if you like that
[00:49] quackslike has joined the channel
[00:49] jmoyers: for me, i dont use deeply nested data structures. in fact, i make a point of keeping it flat and using functional style to map data structures *onto* the templates
[00:49] jmoyers: that way its dirt simple
[00:50] adnam: dto's baby
[00:50] jmoyers: i dont think it helps designers though
[00:50] jmoyers: one way or another
[00:50] tbranyen: harder to think about, especially if you're using JSON from a 3rd party source
[00:50] Vertice: this wasnt deeply nested. it was record.field = {2004: 123, 2005: 234}

[00:51] jmoyers: i dont think so personally

[00:51] c4milo1 has joined the channel
[00:51] tbranyen: twitter is an example i was going to bring up until i remembered the api is mostly flat key, vals
[00:52] tbranyen: not much nesting iirc
[00:52] tbranyen: at least not for getting the message, link and author
[00:52] Vertice: hell. even with something like backbone's model.attributes, you get a hash back. 
[00:52] jmoyers: or get sat, whats easier, {author} or posts[0].author.name
[00:52] jmoyers: anyway, this is small stuff i guess
[00:52] yhahn has joined the channel
[00:52] tbranyen: well ideally it'd be {%using post%}{%author.name%} or something
[00:53] jmoyers: doesn't really matter that much. the reason mustache seemed interesting is because of all the client libraries
[00:53] tbranyen: yeah thats why i have a hardon for it atm
[00:53] Vertice: you know what the great thing about jade or things other than mustache is though, you dont have the choose betwenen the 2
[00:53] tbranyen: just hate its shortcomings
[00:53] jmoyers: you do though imo
[00:53] jmoyers: you build a bunch of views up in some transformative template language
[00:54] jmoyers: and then you are like HMMM, to migrate i have to write some script that compiles it back to html or whatever, and then transfer it to some other template language
[00:54] jmoyers: just seems hokie.
[00:54] jmoyers: keep it as close to the source language as possible
[00:54] tbranyen: right which is why portability and markup agnostic templating is what is so great
[00:54] brianloveswords has joined the channel
[00:55] tbranyen: only working in DOM/HTML stuff is lame

[00:57] tbranyen: pretty much yeah
[00:57] jmoyers: sometimes its okay to use a very specific tool for a very specific job
[00:58] Vertice: it does also feel frustrating to limit yourself because you might need to use somethng else at some point
[00:58] tbranyen: right, glad there is competition to help narrow down the most specific tool

[01:58] jerrysv: is = are, wow, my brain is already on vacation
[01:58] tauren: mscdex: see the bottom for the error and notice the "o" command not found all over the output. any ideas?
[01:58] wano: haha
[01:59] jerrysv: tauren: were you at the js admirers group?
[01:59] tauren: nope, didn't make it.
[02:00] tauren: daughter had soccer practice from 5:30 to 7 and her mom couldn't take her...
[02:00] tauren: did you go?
[02:00] ckknight: tbranyen: I think one thing that'd be handy is having a safe output of a variable and an unsafe output, so that if you're doing an HTML template, you can define the safe function, which would be different if you were outputting to a different format
[02:00] miccolis has joined the channel
[02:00] jerrysv: yeah, it was pretty good
[02:00] tauren: what topics?
[02:00] tbranyen: ckknight: wouldn't that be a filter in this case?
[02:00] tbranyen: {%filter output|safe%}
[02:01] tbranyen: and then you can define your own definition of safe
[02:01] ckknight: tbranyen: I wouldn't use that system unless it was safe by default.
[02:01] caseywstark has joined the channel
[02:01] jerrysv: jsconf and nodeconf, specifically we covered the future of js, transcompilers, node addons, and a lot of theoretical discussion that was fun

[02:01] tbranyen: it is very well suited for html
[02:01] yozgrahame has joined the channel
[02:02] tauren: jerrysv: sounds good. i was going to check out the webex, assuming they made it public
[02:02] ckknight: tbranyen: and other formats have different definitions of safe, and some might have safe be the same as unsafe. I'd still want a way to define the safe filter and have it auto-apply
[02:02] jerrysv: tauren: it was last night
[02:02] jerrysv: duncanbeevers: you around?
[02:02] tbranyen: ckknight: definitely can accomodate that, the idea would be to make the template engine extensible, not black box
[02:02] tauren: jerrysv: i mean, i think they recorded it with webex.
[02:03] tbranyen: so maybe hooks
[02:03] davidcoallier has joined the channel
[02:03] jerrysv: tauren: that was the plan, but not sure how much was picked up on the computer mic
[02:03] ckknight: tbranyen: oh yeah, no doubt about that
[02:03] jerrysv: wano: still on the fb app, or moving back to node tonight?
[02:04] tauren: jerrysv: yeah, maybe it woudn't be worth it. i'll try to make it next month. what was the turnout?
[02:04] jerrysv: tauren: if memory serves, about 20-22?
[02:05] tauren: nice, more than i thought there would be then
[02:05] wano: jerrysv: my hope is a little of both
[02:06] jerrysv: i'm planning on moving on to my judy arrays, end up staying up late maybe
[02:07] tmpvar: judy arrays/

[02:08] jerrysv: and some benchmarks here: http://legitimatesounding.com/blog/Faster_sometimes_Associative_Arrays_with_Node_js.html
[02:08] jerrysv: my c++ is a tiny bit rusty though
[02:09] wano: i might swerve into something more browser-sidey though.. it'd be hella refreshing
[02:09] jerrysv: have you cracked open that js from that app yet?
[02:09] wano: kinda wanna see how far i can push Hype
[02:09] jerrysv: because i didn't in my code review
[02:10] wano: bits of it, not enough to analyze though i was just fixing the asset path stuff that was on the js side
[02:11] jerrysv: hype looks fun
[02:11] pluginbaby: what's hype
[02:11] wano: just browsed through a few of them though and they honestly dont seem nearly as bad as the php side

[02:33] jerrysv: wano: ?
[02:34] digiwano: jerrysv: the plugin-y part of my lib
[02:34] mscdex: italic: well, if you catch the error, you should be able to reset back to cooked mode with nc.reset() or something
[02:34] mscdex: i'd have to look again
[02:34] jslatts_ has joined the channel
[02:35] plutoniix has joined the channel
[02:35] digiwano: i want people to be able to extend my library in a plugin style, so they'd define something and tell me its filename or the dir its in, and i read that plugin and extend my lib to have their functionality defined
[02:35] mscdex: i was close, it's nc.cleanup()
[02:35] digiwano: i havent been able to find anything else in node-land that does something like that, so im unsure of how it should be done
[02:36] mscdex: digiwano: just have each plugin use the same interface and be a regular module
[02:36] italic: mscdex: thanks, i'll work with that. is there an option to compile your ncurses with 256 color support?
[02:36] digiwano: mscdex: how do you mean 'use the same interface'?
[02:37] mscdex: italic: it's automatically compiled in with that support iirc, you just have to set your TERM env var appropriately
[02:37] digiwano: right now what im doing is, letting them define module.exports.MyLibName object that has k/v pairs of name/function, and reading those key/values and adding them
[02:37] mscdex: digiwano: uses the same function names, parameters, etc
[02:37] digiwano: well, myLibNamePlugins
[02:38] digiwano: mscdex: well basically any plugin is more or less an async.js-compatible function that just takes a next parameter
[02:39] tauren: mscdex: unfortunately, working with v0.4.8 has same compile problems
[02:39] matias has joined the channel
[02:39] mscdex: digiwano: something like: var Foo = module.exports = function(pluginOpts) { }; Foo.prototype.pluginMethod = function(){};

[02:39] italic: mscdex: hmm, i can see 256 colors when i test outside of node, but inside i'm just seeing 8

[02:43] sorens3n: i have a few people asking me
[02:43] mscdex: polling is no good
[02:43] mscdex: :p
[02:44] darshanshankar: ^ LOL
[02:44] sorens3n: well, then just general comments / suggestions
[02:44] slicky: at this point I prefer dnode :)
[02:44] sorens3n: i already have a bias, but i wont say since i think it will sway the convo
[02:44] digiwano: mscdex: hrm, i was trying to be a bit more magic than that, this is basically just a css/js resource compiler, and any given plugin is just a set of functions that does something like 'minify this css file', so i'd like to make it so that any css minifier could define one little function to their api to make their lib itself work as a plugin for my library
[02:44] darshanshankar: same, but id love to hear the reasonings for both sides
[02:44] mscdex: sorens3n: well, with dnode you get live tech support from SubStack in here :-D
[02:45] digiwano: maybe im trying to be too magic
[02:45] tbranyen: yeah you never get live node.js help in here
[02:45] digiwano: i am quite often guilty of that
[02:45] tbranyen: ever
[02:45] sorens3n: as a refrence, i used now.js when it was new
[02:45] sorens3n: before the 'group' feature shit
[02:45] slicky: wait this is node.js channel? shit, i thought I was in #ruby
[02:45] italic: mscdex: screen in xfce term, but i've tried others. if set up my term to run that script 256colors2.pl fine, but nc.numColors still returns 8
[02:46] digiwano: but i thought it'd be cool if any random node library that's involved in processing css or js could just build in support for my lib
[02:46] keeth has joined the channel
[02:46] jerrysv: digiwano: keep it simple
[02:46] mscdex: italic: i've only tested with the 256 color xterm TERM value
[02:46] darshanshankar: sorens3n: nowjs still needs stuff like addressing individual clients and excluding clients
[02:47] sorens3n: ah, good to know
[02:47] sorens3n: <-- dnode 
[02:47] sorens3n: mad love
[02:47] sorens3n: i hate now.js for... no particular reason other than it asumming what i want to do with it
[02:47] sorens3n: imho
[02:47] DelvarWorld has joined the channel
[02:47] mscdex: italic: try: export TERM=xterm-256color
[02:47] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[02:47] mscdex: italic: then try running the color test in the examples/ dir
[02:48] darshanshankar: could you expand on that sorens3n ? (im just trying to learn, you wont hurt my feelings lol)
[02:48] digiwano: jerrysv: yeah, honestly the thing that keeps tripping me up is that i'd like to have this 100% configurable by just a .json file and not requiring you to make a custom compiler.js that adds your plugins for you... wondering if i should abandon that
[02:49] digiwano: it's cute but i feel like trying to implement that is just causing me to have to solve even bigger problems
[02:49] jerrysv: digiwano: ever expanding scope, gotta cut your losses somewhere
[02:49] jerrysv: go back and refactor later
[02:49] digiwano: yeah but i really like the idea and its hard to let go of
[02:50] rchavik has joined the channel
[02:50] omni5cience_ has joined the channel
[02:50] italic: mscdex: yup, that did it. evidently screen was supporting 256, but the term wasn't. 'tput colors' was still returning 8. thanks!
[02:51] digiwano: and the only deadline this thing has is that i want to use it both at work and in side projects
[02:51] mscdex: cool :)
[02:51] DelvarWorld: ;(x || y).doSomething()
[02:51] jerrysv: then come up with a simple solution for now, find another reason to get the plugin system built?
[02:51] DelvarWorld: isaacs you crazy
[02:51] sorens3n: darsh: now.js worked for me when i first staretd using it, but when i tried to expand upon it i found ti very difficult
[02:51] isaacs: DelvarWorld: :)
[02:51] jmoyers: sorens3n: i spoke to one of the nowjs guys last weekend
[02:51] sorens3n: dnode had a higher learning curve imo, but i found it very more versitile and expandable
[02:51] jmoyers: they were saying the main thing is clustering/commercial support
[02:51] digiwano: jerrysv: yeah im leaning towards that... of course, at this point, that's only more work before i feel like its good enough for other people to look at
[02:52] darshanshankar: interesting, i haven't heard that before
[02:52] jmoyers: dnode and now do almost identical things -- dnode is cross platform though (the protocol that is), which is great
[02:52] pluginbaby has left the channel
[02:52] sorens3n: i can roll my own pub/sub in dnode with no limitations, now.js seems to assume that i need them to do it for me
[02:52] darshanshankar: ya thats the biggest benefit dnode has, imho
[02:52] mykul has joined the channel
[02:52] jmoyers: i know substack has been trying to get them to just use the dnode over the wire protocol with no success
[02:52] darshanshankar: jmoyers: i think its just too late to rewrite everything with dnode protocol
[02:53] jmoyers: im sure they have investment in what they've written, yes
[02:53] digiwano: but i think that simplifying it as, "if you want to define a plugin, you need to just call Auton.addPlugin('name', plugin_function)" and just leave it at that
[02:54] digiwano: is probably the best plan of action
[02:54] digiwano: regardless of how much code i'll have to rip out to do that
[02:54] gavin_huang has joined the channel
[02:54] digiwano: which honestly is not that much
[02:55] ngs has joined the channel
[02:55] darshanshankar: sorens3n: but isn't pub/sub just one use case?
[02:56] darshanshankar: sorens3n: and i think pub/sub works better now, especially with groups
[02:56] jerrysv: why even call Auton.addPlugin() ?
[02:56] abraham has joined the channel
[02:56] jerrysv: just have a plugins directory
[02:56] guybrush: darshanshankar: nowjs based upon dnode-protocol would be sweet :D (i really like the middlware-concept -- dnode.use() ftw)
[02:56] sorens3n: hmmm
[02:57] _jgr has joined the channel
[02:57] jerrysv: each plugin uses something like module.exports.pluginSetup = function (...)
[02:57] sorens3n: darsh: yes, it is, but node.js seems to assume what/how i should do it
[02:57] jerrysv: and have each plugin register itself -- only plugins in the plugins directory get loaded
[02:57] sorens3n: express.js doesnt assume how i should make a blog...
[02:57] sorens3n: as a comparison
[02:57] jmoyers: rpc != pubsub
[02:57] sorens3n: most true
[02:57] digiwano: jerrysv: well obviously i'd still have a function for both adding a dir and a file, and automagically adding functions exported from those
[02:58] sorens3n: pubsub is just an example use case
[02:58] sorens3n: and the reason i bring it up is that its a now.js 'feature'
[02:58] jerrysv: set plugin directory paths via an env
[02:58] digiwano: but if you're just defining one plugin that's just  4 line function, requiring you to have a plugins dir sounds cruel when its something you could do inline in your script
[02:58] darshanshankar: hmm i need to think about this
[02:58] darshanshankar: brb!
[02:58] sorens3n: as a background, i was looking to do backbone.js integration with CRUD and pub/sub support
[02:58] jerrysv: export AUTON_DIR=~/plugins:/usr/local/auton/plugins
[02:59] sorens3n: i went from now.js to juggernaut to dnode
[02:59] sorens3n: and have had nothing but ease of use with dnode above all
[02:59] sorens3n: no limitations other than the current IE problem
[02:59] sorens3n: which... besides the 'fuck IE' i'm sure it can be fixed just like it was before
[03:00] digiwano: jerrysv: heh ok, i will also do that
[03:00] jmoyers: out of curiosity, which use rpc style at all?
[03:00] sorens3n: which / why?
[03:00] slicky: sorens3n, any of it OSS and viewable? I'm curious to see what you've come up with :)
[03:00] jmoyers: its pretty easy to use socket.io and re-emit custom events etc
[03:00] guybrush: jmoyers: true
[03:00] jmoyers: or 0.7 with builtin custom events/channels
[03:00] sorens3n: https://github.com/sorensen/backbone-redis
[03:00] tauren: sorens3n: i've been looking for resources on doing backbone.js using dnode. are you sharing any thoughts or code somewhere?
[03:00] sorens3n: that was my first integration modeling the juggernaut library
[03:01] sorens3n: https://github.com/sorensen/backbone-dnode was the second attempt
[03:01] sorens3n: i have an app up at http://sorensen.no.de
[03:01] guybrush: jmoyers: i use dnode not because it makes using socketio easier
[03:01] sorens3n: which is backbone.js/mongoose/dnode
[03:01] jerrysv: digiwano: and have an argument you can pass in with --plugin-directory= or whatever
[03:01] sorens3n: but im undecided as to make it OSS or not
[03:01] digiwano: oh, yeah good call
[03:01] sorens3n: tauren, i would love to 
[03:01] guybrush: jmoyers: it is just a "standard" way to do things - like passing callbacks through rpc
[03:01] sorens3n: i will update my backbone-dnode repo right now
[03:02] jmoyers: guybrush: ah
[03:02] sorens3n: to the current project 
[03:02] jmoyers: i prefer state over the wire
[03:02] jmoyers: and looser coupling wrt how state changes are handled i guess
[03:02] jerrysv: digiwano: i use optimist
[03:02] guybrush: jmoyers: with dnode you can implement rpc between server/client (must not be browser) very easy!
[03:02] tauren: sorens3n: so backbone-dnode is your latest experiments with this?
[03:02] jmoyers: right, i get that -- there are use cases for rpc
[03:03] jmoyers: but for a single page app, i don't get the benefits
[03:03] guybrush: yes
[03:03] digiwano: jerrysv: i'll look into that i havent done that part at all yet
[03:03] guybrush: well.. the benefit is, i can write everything against a protocol
[03:03] guybrush: so it will stick together fine with other stuff written the same way
[03:03] sorens3n: well... the latest is not OSS anymore
[03:03] sorens3n: i
[03:04] sorens3n: i'm considering making something commercial out of it, so i removed it from public
[03:04] jmoyers: json as state over the wire sticks together with things also
[03:04] sorens3n: but idk
[03:04] jmoyers: and i can stick it directly into a message queue
[03:04] jmoyers: like rabbit etc
[03:04] sorens3n: if you want to see it i will public it
[03:04] tauren: sorens3n: understood, just wanting some examples to look at
[03:04] slicky: sorens3n, I'd love to see it :)
[03:04] guybrush: i do everything the dnode way -> results in very "stack"able modules (note the wordplay :D)
[03:04] sorens3n: yep, i will public it
[03:04] slicky: tauren: same :D
[03:04] tauren: sorens3n: sweet
[03:04] sorens3n: just dont make any money or i'll be jelly
[03:04] sorens3n: :D
[03:04] DelvarWorld: isaacs: dammit man, tell me where I should put my bundleddepenecy folder, could I put it in node_modules, or is that npm only territory? if not, would   "bundledDependencies": ["node-couchdb"] mean that it loads it from ./node-couchdb relative to the root of your project?

[03:05] sorens3n: https://github.com/sorensen/aebleskiver

[03:06] sorens3n: the lib/protocol-* methods are the serverside dnodes
[03:06] sorens3n: and public/rpc/* are the client 
[03:06] sorens3n: its integrated into backbone.js like woa
[03:06] sorens3n: feel free to use any of those
[03:06] sorens3n: i'm only worried about the model/views
[03:06] sorens3n: which are the actual business logic
[03:07] sorens3n: but obviously underdeveloped to the point i'm not severely concerened
[03:07] digiwano: jerrysv: ok, looked into and decided on, that lib is cool as heck
[03:07] Emmanuel has joined the channel
[03:07] sorens3n: i will leave it public for 24 hours
[03:07] sorens3n: i'm worried about the marketing type just grabbing the repo that i might turn into a business, which is my own problem really
[03:07] sorens3n: for not making something happen with it already
[03:07] tauren: sorens3n: aebleskiver is your latest, surpasses backbone-dnode? i see it uses mongo for persistence, great!
[03:08] sorens3n: :D i need to update backbone-ddnode
[03:08] sorens3n: with everything there
[03:08] sorens3n: the protocols and rpc folder will all be OSS
[03:08] slicky: sorens3n: cool, thanks... I basically want to see how you implemented the backbone/socketio and datastorage aspects
[03:08] sorens3n: i just havn't ripped them again lately
[03:08] sorens3n: i develop utilities based on projects
[03:08] tauren: sorens3n: same here, i'm with slicky . no plans to rip you off! :)
[03:09] sorens3n: no worries, or i wouldn't have showed you
[03:09] sorens3n: just felt the need to explain myself to a fellow hacker
[03:09] sorens3n: tthat i'm not a douche
[03:09] sorens3n: :D
[03:10] sorens3n: if i can do anything to help the community, i'm happy
[03:10] sorens3n: since i've taken so much from it
[03:10] sorens3n: express/mongoose/keys/dnode/connect/socket.io ect...
[03:10] slicky: sorens3n: very commendable of you, sir :)
[03:11] tauren: sorens3n: been looking into 0mq lately. any thoughts on if it would be useful in your stack?
[03:11] guybrush: sorens3n++ :)
[03:11] guybrush: sorens3n++
[03:11] v8bot:  guybrush has given a beer to sorens3n. sorens3n now has 1 beers.
[03:11] guybrush: it doesnt work with smilies :/
[03:11] jmoyers: thats a feature
[03:11] sorens3n: not familiar with 0mq
[03:12] jerrysv: digiwano: exactly how i felt
[03:12] slicky: sorens3n: your project makes me hungry for some reason, not sure why
[03:12] sorens3n: hehehe
[03:12] sorens3n: im very danish
[03:12] sorens3n: i will be eating those saturday
[03:12] jmoyers: 0mq is not useful in this particular context
[03:12] sorens3n: at tivolifest
[03:12] sorens3n: can someone explain it to me in a sentance?
[03:12] sorens3n: google gave too many results
[03:13] tauren: jmoyers: care to elaborate?
[03:13] sorens3n: 0 message queue?
[03:13] jmoyers: damn decent for things that have client libraries for it
[03:13] jmoyers: sure
[03:13] slicky: https://github.com/zeromq/zeromq2
[03:13] tauren: sorens3n: http://www.zeromq.org/
[03:13] jmoyers: its a brokerless message queue -- a way of creating exchanges (topic/fanout/whatever) based on no central server node
[03:13] sorens3n: i will say as a forewarning, that these packages use thread-memory
[03:13] jmoyers: its got client libraries in many languages
[03:13] jmoyers: but as far as i know, it has no use case for server -> browser
[03:13] sorens3n: my next step is moving the thread-memory things to redis storage
[03:13] jmoyers: server -> server, or server -> desktop client, yes
[03:13] sorens3n: like the clients / subscriptions
[03:13] xandrews has joined the channel
[03:14] sorens3n: which i could use natively in redis, but i prefer not to since it seems limiting to me, even though it might be better perfomance
[03:15] jmoyers: well
[03:15] sorens3n: i started using redis-pubsub, but i dont want to be stuck using redis
[03:15] sorens3n: so0z
[03:15] jmoyers: it supports more complex channel structures than reg pubsub from redis
[03:15] jmoyers: also, redis has a server node involved
[03:15] tauren: jmoyers: but would using 0mq or similar help to scale the app on the server? so server-server communication?
[03:15] jmoyers: this is brokerless
[03:15] sorens3n: ah, i'd just assume try to do that in dnode, just even ffor the learning if nothing else
[03:15] jmoyers: its a general purpose networking library
[03:16] sorens3n: though, would that help me solve a video sharing problem?
[03:16] Corren has joined the channel
[03:16] sorens3n: i wanted to stream webcams
[03:16] jakehow has joined the channel
[03:16] jmoyers: it doesn't have built in persistence and things that are features of other message queue like technologies, but its made to be fast and distributed
[03:16] sorens3n: node-canvas n such, but thats not possible
[03:16] sorens3n: too slow
[03:16] jtsnow: Anyone use node-http-proxy? I'm looking for a way to alter the proxied response before it's sent to the browser
[03:16] sorens3n: figured i'd have to use adobe cirrus 
[03:17] jmoyers: tauren: 'scale an app on the server' is too broad
[03:17] slicky: jtsnow: Have you tried Hoxy?
[03:17] slicky: jtsnow: https://github.com/greim/hoxy
[03:17] jtsnow: slicky: I haven't, I'll take a look
[03:18] sorens3n: mmm, not sure of the benefits of http-proxy
[03:18] sorens3n: i know i need to use something like Cluster...
[03:18] sorens3n: but beyond that... bleh
[03:18] sorens3n: i went from PHP to node.js
[03:19] sorens3n: so forgive me if i say some nub shit
[03:19] rictic has joined the channel
[03:19] jmoyers: cluster is multi-process

[03:20] polvero has joined the channel

[04:26] jmoyers: nope, san francisco
[04:26] chjj: sometimes i cant decide whether to use a 400 or a 500, i think i like 400 more, so i can blame the user

[04:27] mertonium has joined the channel
[04:27] jerrysv: hm. all of this is interesting, but i'm finding myself in a conundrum
[04:27] sorens3n: 500 is when the server fucks up and there is no 400
[04:27] zeunix: jmoyers: maybe I was spoiled in nebraska, maybe they aren't "more respectable" maybe just different.
[04:27] sorens3n: 400 is when the server cant even try to 500 cuz you didn't give it enough
[04:27] sorens3n: unless we talking about marriage still
[04:27] chjj: i know, but sometimes i want to do 400, just so i dont have to admit error
[04:27] jerrysv: i'm storing data via a c++ add-on
[04:27] chjj: and blame the user instead
[04:27] sorens3n: hehehe
[04:27] chjj: ;)
[04:27] sorens3n: i like it

[04:29] chjj: haha, i was joking, calm down

[05:14] jesusabdullah: THERE
[05:14] jesusabdullah: But yes: Why are those both the same? D:
[05:14] jesusabdullah: Why does a.sort() also sort b? Moreover, how can I fix this?
[05:14] jerrysv: b is assigning a reference to a? and once a gets sorted, b is as well?
[05:15] jerrysv: er, is assigned a reference to
[05:15] jslatts: so, my thought was to not use libev and just try and map the callback to javascript function
[05:15] jesusabdullah: How do I make it copy then, instead of just referencing? >_<
[05:15] SubStack: sort() updates in-place
[05:15] SubStack: jesusabdullah: you can toss in a .slice() in there
[05:16] jerrysv: a = [1, 3, 5, 4, 2]; b = a.slice(); a.sort();
[05:16] jesusabdullah: hmm!
[05:16] jesusabdullah: Man that's tricky
[05:16] jesusabdullah: idk if I'll be able to get this thing <140 chars >_<
[05:16] jesusabdullah: I thought I was done!

[05:18] jesusabdullah: and this one's supposed to generate sparktweets so

[05:32] jerrysv: jslatts: but in general, writing a lot of tests, gdb/valgrind when it crashes, and at worst case outputting what i expect vs what i am getting

[05:57] sorens3n: you got me to move from PHP
[05:58] MooGoo: I dont get it

[05:58] MooGoo: I only see the sample file

[05:58] MooGoo: dont worry sorens3n 
[05:58] dgathright has joined the channel
[05:58] ryah: sorens3n: you're with friends here - those who love the async blades of pain 
[05:59] jesusabdullah: I used php like once
[05:59] MooGoo: you can rightly feel above anyone who makes fun of you for not coding in PHP
[05:59] Lorentz: I'm doing php right now
[05:59] sorens3n: hehe, glad to hear
[05:59] jesusabdullah: it was back when the built-in templating was a big deal
[05:59] sorens3n: thanks MooGoo
[05:59] jesusabdullah: all people talked about were lamp servers
[05:59] jesusabdullah: and online help sucked
[05:59] deebo: php is a recursive acronym, and that pretty much says it all
[05:59] jesusabdullah: and I wrote a really crappy, probably insecure, thing.
[05:59] jesusabdullah: pretty horrendous poop?
[06:00] sorens3n: my latest thing was Kohana before node.js
[06:00] MooGoo: I forked this 140byte thing but all I got was the sample
[06:00] jesusabdullah: what's Kohana?
[06:00] jmoyers: a framework
[06:00] jesusabdullah: MooGoo: So you edit it to be what you want it to be
[06:00] jmoyers: its..
[06:00] sorens3n: and in respects to tjholloway, i learned node.js via Express.js
[06:00] deebo: php = PHP hypertext processor = PHP hypertext processor hypertext processor = ...
[06:00] MooGoo: so I can make shit up
[06:00] MooGoo: what is the point of this
[06:00] sorens3n: PHP is like CodeIgniter
[06:00] sorens3n: errr
[06:00] yhahn has joined the channel
[06:00] sorens3n: Kohana is like CodeIgniter
[06:00] jesusabdullah: MooGoo: Showing off, basically
[06:00] sorens3n: direct fork
[06:00] jesusabdullah: The fun thing is you can make the code a twitter status
[06:00] MooGoo: so I have to find some function that actully can be reduced to 140bytes
[06:01] MooGoo: then do it
[06:01] MooGoo: no requests or challeneges
[06:01] sorens3n: do it if it can be done, putting yourself in that kind of restraints can be very inspiring, but also just as limiting
[06:01] amaudy has joined the channel
[06:02] HornyiPadHumper has joined the channel
[06:02] MooGoo: yes but...if someone just showed me the code I could do it
[06:02] MooGoo: but having to bring my own function to the party
[06:02] MooGoo: I dunno
[06:02] hassox has joined the channel
[06:05] sorens3n: i look at 140bytes as something that, i keep it in the back of my head, and if something comes about that i can reduce to that, i will, otherwise, its just kinda trendy
[06:05] sorens3n: because most i've found in it, i have available in backbone.js and underscore.js 
[06:05] jesusabdullah: Yeah, definitely just trendy/fun
[06:06] jesusabdullah: the one thing I can think of is bookmarklets
[06:06] sorens3n: yes, and by all means, i love and respect it
[06:06] sorens3n: YES!
[06:06] jesusabdullah: I wrote a bookmarklet yesterday
[06:06] jesusabdullah: It was something special
[06:06] H2S04 has joined the channel
[06:06] jesusabdullah: I sorely missed method chaining with my dom-building
[06:07] MooGoo: well I have no ideas
[06:07] MooGoo: I was looking foward to new js code golf
[06:07] MooGoo: all my js is too dependent on other js to be useful in isolation
[06:08] samsonjs has joined the channel
[06:08] jesusabdullah: Write me a 140 byte chainable DOM tool
[06:08] jesusabdullah: right now!
[06:08] MooGoo: ok
[06:08] MooGoo: I think id use up all my bytes just writing out DOM method names
[06:08] jesusabdullah: Well
[06:08] jesusabdullah: You might not *have* to write out all the names
[06:09] MooGoo: give me an example of the usage of this
[06:10] jesusabdullah: Well, you've used jquery right?
[06:10] jesusabdullah: You know how with jquery, everything returns "this" ?
[06:10] MooGoo: I think I've heard of that at some point somewhere
[06:10] AdmGre has joined the channel
[06:10] MooGoo: yes
[06:10] MooGoo: why restrict it to chaining DOM then
[06:10] MooGoo: it could chain anything
[06:11] jesusabdullah: Sure
[06:11] jesusabdullah: I just want something short that lets me chain my shit instead of having to create temporary vars to create, add things, and THEN append to body
[06:11] jesusabdullah: or whatever
[06:11] sorens3n: i try to always return 'this'
[06:11] sorens3n: since i love chaining
[06:12] sorens3n: but, that seems to me an OCD for code cleanliness than anything
[06:12] jesusabdullah: https://github.com/jesusabdullah/browserling_bookmarklets/blob/master/bookmarklet.js is what I want to avoid
[06:12] sorens3n: since i dont use it much
[06:12] jesusabdullah: c1.style.x('whatever') should return c1, not the text "whatever"
[06:12] jesusabdullah: >_<
[06:13] MooGoo: I wrote a generic chainer in some SO answer awhile ago
[06:14] jesusabdullah: I wouldn't mind seeing that actually
[06:14] MooGoo: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3314162/html5-canvas-challenge/3314444#3314444
[06:14] jesusabdullah: It doesn't have to be 140 chars to be useful :)
[06:14] MooGoo: I dunno if that is useful
[06:14] MooGoo: or what you want
[06:14] MooGoo: I was being a bit snarky
[06:14] skm has joined the channel
[06:14] jesusabdullah: You can use `with` that way?
[06:15] MooGoo: yes
[06:16] jesusabdullah: Huh!
[06:16] jesusabdullah: SCREW BEST PRACTICES
[06:16] MooGoo: INDEED
[06:16] MooGoo: with can be useful
[06:16] sorens3n: MooGoo: its like the router / template functions in 140 bytes
[06:16] MooGoo: like
[06:16] sorens3n: id still rather use _underscore
[06:16] MooGoo: with (element.style) { etc }
[06:16] __jgr has joined the channel
[06:16] sorens3n: and spend the extra bytes

[06:28] HornyiPadHumper: Now that we have a good server-side JS platform, has anyone made an attempt to tie client-side (browser) coding with server-side JS in some way (like in an IDE or framework)?
[06:28] briznad has joined the channel
[06:28] cpolis has joined the channel
[06:29] sorens3n: backbone.js
[06:29] sorens3n: which can be used on client/server side
[06:29] HornyiPadHumper: What does it do mainly?
[06:29] MooGoo: that's just a library
[06:30] sorens3n: he asked for framework, i suggested a framework
[06:30] MooGoo: I think he's talking about some kinda setup where client+server code is transparently combined
[06:30] MooGoo: maybe like with GWT for example
[06:30] sorens3n: i dont use backbone on the server
[06:30] sorens3n: its for organizing the DOM and jQuery 
[06:30] ChrisPartridge: HornyiPadHumper: check out dnode and nowjs
[06:30] sorens3n: in an MVC way
[06:31] sorens3n: dnode and now.js are hardly the answer to his question
[06:31] MooGoo: backbone is mostly utility functions
[06:31] MooGoo: isnt it
[06:31] sorens3n: he wasn't asking about sockets
[06:31] sorens3n: no, thats underscore.js
[06:31] sorens3n: backbone is an MVC framework which is more or less underscore + jquery
[06:31] sorens3n: meant for the client side
[06:31] shimondoodkin: i try to do one it is in a very early stage http://vot.me:2222
[06:31] sorens3n: but can be used on the server, which makes it versitile
[06:32] MooGoo: man I was so spoiled only having to code for mozilla for so long
[06:32] MooGoo: made me not want to waste my time with libraries
[06:32] mikeal has joined the channel
[06:32] sorens3n: that doesnt make much sense
[06:32] sorens3n: i dont get what your saying
[06:32] rahul_ has joined the channel
[06:32] MooGoo: im saying
[06:32] mertonium_ has joined the channel
[06:32] sorens3n: underscore is like the Irvine library for assembly language
[06:32] MooGoo: the usefulness of libraries like jquery goes way down when writing code that only needs to work in a mozilla browser
[06:33] sorens3n: even still, the usefullness is still there
[06:33] MooGoo: more is built in, plus document.evaluate
[06:33] sorens3n: i write 2 lines of code, you write 10
[06:33] sorens3n: case in point
[06:33] MooGoo: easy to write a wrapper function around it
[06:33] davidcoallier has joined the channel
[06:33] sorens3n: which jquery is
[06:33] sorens3n: ?
[06:33] HornyiPadHumper: Yes, I do mean transparently combining client-side and server-side JS (not sure if that is even a good idea).
[06:34] MooGoo: nah
[06:34] rahul_: Hi. I am node.js n00b (just started out a day ago) - a very basic Question - if node.js leverages Google's V8 engine - why can't node.js run on windows straight of the bat?
[06:34] MooGoo: evaluate works on xpath
[06:34] shimondoodkin: do you have an opinion about fibers ?
[06:34] MooGoo: I prefer xpath for webscraping at least
[06:34] sorens3n: MooGoo, its really a debate about API's then is it not? or frameworks in general?
[06:34] Bonuspunkt has joined the channel
[06:34] MooGoo: it's not a debate
[06:34] MooGoo: libraries are good
[06:34] sorens3n: sorry, bad word to use
[06:35] MooGoo: but without having to worry about browser compatibility
[06:35] sorens3n: question*
[06:35] shimondoodkin: there are jsdom scapers witch work well enough
[06:35] MooGoo: and being able to rely on the more extensive built in functions of modern JS
[06:35] sorens3n: i dont think of jquery as browser compatibility when i use it, its just getting more done faster and easier
[06:35] MooGoo: and in the context of me writing this code 5+ years ago
[06:35] sorens3n: and if your only coding for mozilla, well, luck you
[06:35] sorens3n: lucky*
[06:36] jmoyers: rahul_: it runs on v8, but introduces a bunch of api's that have nothing to do with v8 (file system, http, net, etc)
[06:36] jmoyers: rahul_: native windows compatibility is a major goal of the project, though -- its being worked on actively
[06:36] sorens3n: i have never had the good fortune of only using one browser, and imho, thats not the power of the internet, which is why i became a web-dev
[06:36] MooGoo: well
[06:37] MooGoo: in an internal enviornment
[06:37] sorens3n: the world can see ur program, if not, just make a windows app
[06:37] HornyiPadHumper: jmoyers: I would focus more on the cloud.
[06:37] MooGoo: it makes developing so much easier
[06:37] rahul_: jmoyers, thanks - good to hear that.
[06:37] sorens3n: or a native OS app
[06:37] shimondoodkin: HornyiPadHumper: people try to use socket.io with backbone and RestDAtaStores with dojo
[06:37] jmoyers: HornyiPadHumper: i have no idea what that means
[06:37] MooGoo: and this was back in a time when IE6 compatibility was still expected
[06:37] MooGoo: things are much better now
[06:37] sorens3n: before i say something dumb though, be aware, i've had a few drinks
[06:37] MooGoo: than they were

[06:40] sorens3n: yeah nice going
[06:40] Aria: Sweet! What's the next target? 10,000?
[06:40] sorens3n: hehe
[06:40] MooGoo: since I never delete code, I just comment things out, I often hit that number and above
[06:40] rahul_:  Can I also get a perspective on whether node.js would suit an application which has a fairly heavy middle tier with lot of application logic?
[06:40] sorens3n: i have a habbit of constantly deleting, since i started using Git
[06:41] HornyiPadHumper: Versioning is good
[06:41] MooGoo: nodejs really doesnt compare with something like PHP...
[06:41] MooGoo: it's much more low level
[06:41] sorens3n: well....
[06:41] sorens3n: thats arguable
[06:41] MooGoo: if you want to use a module
[06:41] sorens3n: i went from PHP to this
[06:41] Aria: rahul_: Sure. It's a little verbose in places, but I find it makes great, modular software.
[06:41] MooGoo: but raw nodejs is like writing apache and mod_php before getting to work on the website
[06:42] sorens3n: its a strange comparison
[06:42] Aria: Where "apache" is 6 lines and "mod_php" is 12.
[06:42] sorens3n: since PHP is really NPM packages just 'build in'

[06:43] SubStack: or so jesusabdullah says
[06:43] MooGoo: the built in HTTP server functions in node are pretty raw
[06:43] sorens3n: PHP does not
[06:43] sorens3n: i disagree
[06:43] rahul_: Aria, I'd like to spike a census app using Node.js - any recommendations on what stack of libs I might looks at (I have a java, ruby background)

[06:43] `3rdEden has joined the channel
[06:43] Aria: level09: daemontools, forever
[06:43] MooGoo: it doesnt serve files, or content types, it just serves headers and data
[06:43] HornyiPadHumper: sorens3n: I mean, it lets you embed code inside HTML
[06:43] Aria: rahul_: express.
[06:43] chjj: php does whats called, shitting all over your markup
[06:43] sorens3n: like... JS does
[06:43] level09: Aria: like monit , and upstart ?
[06:43] sorens3n: its a hard comparison
[06:43] HornyiPadHumper: sorens3n: With what?
[06:44] Aria: rahul_: It's a bit like Sinatra, and it's a remarkably small layer on top of connect, which is delightful middleware on top of node's http lib.
[06:44] sorens3n: PHP was meant to do that from its origins
[06:44] Aria: level09: Sure, or those.

[06:46] MooGoo: how do you selectivly "require" modules in PHP
[06:46] k1ttty has joined the channel
[06:46] chjj: why are we discussing inferior platforms in the node.js channel?
[06:46] MooGoo: I dont even know
[06:46] sorens3n: require 'shit.php'
[06:46] MooGoo: sigh
[06:46] sorens3n: oops, require 'shit.php';
[06:46] sorens3n: i know what u mean
[06:46] sorens3n: im being a dick
[06:46] sorens3n: sorry
[06:46] HornyiPadHumper: JSP > PHP
[06:46] sorens3n: few drinks in me
[06:47] sorens3n: and i hate php since moving to an elegant language like JS
[06:47] MooGoo: I CRY
[06:47] sorens3n: but PHP has paid the bills
[06:47] MooGoo: JS could be more elegent
[06:47] sorens3n: so i give it respect
[06:47] supster: There is no feature to display line numbers.  You can go to a line
[06:47] supster: with Edit / Go to Line.There is no feature to display line numbers.  You can go to a line
[06:47] MooGoo: PHP gets the fucking job done man
[06:47] supster: yikes, sorry for paste :<
[06:47] sorens3n: MooGoo: agreed
[06:47] chjj: the first time i used node.js, i immediately realized everything else was obsolete 
[06:47] sorens3n: like i said
[06:47] Aria: Assuming the job is one PHP is okay at.
[06:47] chjj: so, no sense talking about it anymore really
[06:48] sorens3n: i hacked a Kohana PHP application
[06:48] gozala has joined the channel
[06:48] sorens3n: and made a custom admin / CMS / CRM solution
[06:48] level09: but node cant still replace php , no ?
[06:48] sorens3n: then moved to node.js
[06:48] sorens3n: i was so sad
[06:48] Opaque has joined the channel
[06:48] sorens3n: to not use it
[06:48] chjj: level09: what does that mean?
[06:48] supster: sorens3n: kohana is quite nice
[06:48] MooGoo: chjj: I might agree of Nodejs supported continuations
[06:48] chjj: replace it in what regard?
[06:48] Aria: level09: No, node interprets javascript, not php ;-)
[06:48] jesusabdullah: Some of those other languages have nice libs though
[06:48] sorens3n: supster: agreed, i love it
[06:48] jesusabdullah: idk about php, but
[06:48] level09: Aria: as a backend language
[06:48] jesusabdullah: python still has some solid libs
[06:49] Aria: node can do everything php can. They're both turing complete and can talk to other things.
[06:49] level09: but one thing I dont get
[06:49] MooGoo: node does async better
[06:49] shimondoodkin: level09: but for large production you want to base it on some multi-threaded somthing like https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules cluster Spark or https://github.com/nodejitsu/haibu and put it on  https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vcap but i dont know how vcap works
[06:49] Aria: But whether you want to is another matter. That's a much more complicated conversation.
[06:49] MooGoo: that's the point
[06:49] jesusabdullah: I much like node on the backend, so to speak
[06:49] level09: there is a node-mysql module, how can you do non-blocking asynchronous transactions on mysql ?
[06:49] jesusabdullah: I'm actually not a web guy at all by training XD
[06:49] MooGoo: child process level09
[06:49] brownies has joined the channel
[06:49] Yoric has joined the channel
[06:49] chjj: level09: felixge's node-mysql
[06:50] Aria: Yeah, just do it.
[06:50] HornyiPadHumper: sorens3n: There are commercial web apps out there that are coded in both node.js and PHP for view/controller stuff
[06:50] level09: yes, but what I meant, we actually need mysql transactions to be blocking
[06:50] MooGoo: last time I looked all the node mysql modules were broken
[06:50] Aria: Why?
[06:50] felixge: chjj: transactions are not supported yet
[06:50] MooGoo: but they are probably good now
[06:50] Yoric has left the channel
[06:50] nivoc has joined the channel
[06:50] chjj: oh, i see
[06:50] felixge: level09: that doesn't make sense
[06:50] rahul__ has joined the channel
[06:50] level09: data integrity
[06:50] Aria: Huh?
[06:50] MooGoo: so
[06:50] level09: for example, two admin editing same content
[06:50] Aria: how does blocking on a call ensure data integrity?
[06:50] MooGoo: there's no blocking mysql modules for node?
[06:50] level09: you need to block updating the record
[06:50] MooGoo: I'm using a blocking sqlite module
[06:51] HornyiPadHumper: There are commercial web apps out there that are coded in both node.js and PHP for view/controller stuff
[06:51] level09: aha
[06:51] level09: so it is a blocking module ?
[06:51] Aria: I think what you want is called 'locking', not 'blocking'
[06:51] felixge: level09: you don't need non-blocking I/O for that
[06:51] level09: aah
[06:51] rahul__: Aria, thanks, appreciate it. (i should get back and get my hands dirty with some node-fu) 
[06:51] level09: :)
[06:51] MooGoo: it's just a direct link to the C++ libs
[06:51] level09: yes that was the right term 
[06:51] MooGoo: pretty much
[06:51] OneBraveHog: right, blocking as to network, locking as to shared access DB wise
[06:51] Aria: And you ... just lock. There's no magic. When the first one goes, you lock, when the second one gets there, you say no way.
[06:51] Aria: No need for blocking IO
[06:51] davidcoallier has joined the channel
[06:51] sorens3n: Horni: whats the point of using two server-side frameworks?
[06:52] level09: so it is non-blocking, but locking 
[06:52] Aria: sorens3n: To let each do what they're good at?
[06:52] level09: that makes sense now :)
[06:52] Aria: level09: Yeah. Completely different concepts.
[06:52] sorens3n: Aria: i lost your point of reference
[06:52] Aria: "blocking" means "waiting". "locking" means "excluding"
[06:52] shimondoodkin: does any body has an opinion about node-fibers ?
[06:52] MooGoo: are we
[06:52] HornyiPadHumper: felixge: Why use blocking to update a record? You can use an anonymous callback function to continue.
[06:52] MooGoo: talking about
[06:52] MooGoo: table locking
[06:52] Aria: sorens3n: What's the point of two server-side frameworks? To let each do what they're good at.
[06:52] OneBraveHog: also row locking
[06:52] MooGoo: shimondoodkin: good idea but couldnt get it to work when I downloaded
[06:52] Aria: MooGoo: That's one possible interpretation.
[06:53] sorens3n: ah, i see, what can PHP do then that isn't better served with node.js?
[06:53] Aria: If the node app is the only access point to the database, you could also use a locking variable.
[06:53] sorens3n: comming from a PHP background
[06:53] Aria: sorens3n: run PHP code.
[06:53] k1ttty has joined the channel
[06:53] level09: so when many people are writing to a record, it will not block it, but will still lock it ?
[06:53] MooGoo: and PHP libs
[06:53] sorens3n: i went form PHP to node.js
[06:53] sorens3n: so i feel like i know what i'm talking about
[06:53] MooGoo: that depends on mysql level09
[06:53] HornyiPadHumper: sorens3n: So you can hire minimum wage PHP monkeys for the simple parts of the app (view/controller) and code the core in node.js
[06:53] sorens3n: and i have found nothing that node.js can't do that PHP can do
[06:53] AAA_awright: What's that?
[06:53] OneBraveHog: I'm skipping php and starting with node.js (used to use ASP though)
[06:53] sorens3n: in that case, shame on you
[06:53] Aria: level09: Sure. If you want to serialize, use a queue; if you want to exclude and have the first win, use a pessimistic lock; if you want to be more complicated, you might go with oplocks or something.
[06:53] MooGoo: have you found that in any other language
[06:54] MooGoo: it's just a language
[06:54] sorens3n: Horny: SHAME ON YOU
[06:54] iori has joined the channel

[06:55] sorens3n: minimum wage you say

[06:55] felixge: `3rdEden: thanks. Now I can add much more bacon to the core ;)

[06:55] `3rdEden: felixge \o/ free codebloat
[06:55] sorens3n: hire shit workers and i promise you are going to fail
[06:56] HornyiPadHumper: sorens3n: The important stuff is coded by core programmers in node.js, C++, and Perl. They are paid $150/hour
[06:56] sorens3n: pay them nothing and i promise you they will give you nothing
[06:56] felixge: `3rdEden: nah, I guess you didn't see my bacon commit :)
[06:56] MooGoo: c++ and perl
[06:56] HornyiPadHumper: MooGoo: Only for a few things
[06:56] `3rdEden: felixge hook me up
[06:56] felixge: `3rdEden: anyway, I'm really only allowed to fix typos & stuff. Everything else goes through the BDFL
[06:56] `3rdEden: with the url :P
[06:56] shimondoodkin: level09: ther eis also http://cast-project.org/
[06:56] sorens3n: dont try to sugar coat it
[06:56] MooGoo: all my important code is written in malbolge
[06:56] sorens3n: i hope you pay your PHP devs 20+
[06:57] sorens3n: as 'minimum wage'
[06:57] sorens3n: and thats low imho
[06:57] level09: shimondoodkin: whats that for ?
[06:57] `3rdEden: felixge: BDFL is good thing
[06:57] MooGoo: companies are cheap
[06:57] HornyiPadHumper: sorens3n: We can't pay people $150/hour to put together basic stuff.

[06:59] HornyiPadHumper: sorens3n: Please understand that I have some node.js guys and a talented woman (UX) that I am paying well over $100 an hour where it counts

[07:20] MooGoo: ?
[07:21] digiwano: this one: https://github.com/ajaxorg/async.js/
[07:21] digiwano: its very functional composition-y, which
[07:21] digiwano: <3
[07:21] MooGoo: it just chains functions
[07:21] MooGoo: er
[07:21] MooGoo: you just list them or something
[07:21] MooGoo: instead of nesting them
[07:21] rahul_ has joined the channel
[07:21] digiwano: you get much more nerd street cred if you say function composition 
[07:21] MooGoo: wat
[07:21] jesusabdullah: It's true!
[07:22] MooGoo: wtf is a function composition
[07:22] jesusabdullah: f(g(x))
[07:22] jesusabdullah: CHUCKLES
[07:22] digiwano: in functional programming, its composing a nested chain of functions into a single funtion
[07:22] MooGoo: how bout
[07:22] smcq has joined the channel
[07:22] MooGoo: I just say functions
[07:23] jesusabdullah: Here's a function composition: function(x) { return f(g(x)); } That makes a new function "composed" of f and g
[07:23] MooGoo: problem
[07:23] jesusabdullah: It's a powerful idea, especially in a language like haskell where you can just write something like, f . g
[07:23] MooGoo: well my function is composed of a random alert() statement
[07:23] jesusabdullah: BAM
[07:23] MooGoo: so that's a composition
[07:23] jesusabdullah: Well, not necessarily
[07:23] MooGoo: all my functions are composed of some shit
[07:23] MooGoo: I mean they really gotta be
[07:23] rahul_ has joined the channel
[07:24] MooGoo: else their just empty
[07:24] MooGoo: they're
[07:24] jesusabdullah: A composition is a technical term for the idea of taking pre-existing functions and mashing them together to make new functions
[07:24] MooGoo: so its like
[07:24] MooGoo: taking instructions
[07:24] jesusabdullah: That is, there is a subtle difference between function fog (x) { return f(g(x)); }
[07:24] MooGoo: and putting them together
[07:24] digiwano: ya i fell in love with scala a while back, except for the fact that it runs on the jvm which is pretty much a major dealkiller for me
[07:24] MooGoo: to make programs
[07:24] supster: no. it's passing the result of one function to another!
[07:24] jesusabdullah: and f(g(x)) itself
[07:25] MooGoo: anyway
[07:25] MooGoo: it's still unnatural
[07:25] MooGoo: without real support for continuations
[07:25] MooGoo: like yield
[07:25] jesusabdullah: ugh
[07:25] jesusabdullah: no
[07:25] MooGoo: yes
[07:25] digiwano: but i suggest the scala book to any programmer writing code in any language, i think the concepts and thinking it introduces to you can make you a better programmer in general even if you never write a line of scala code
[07:25] jesusabdullah: no no no
[07:25] MooGoo: yes
[07:25] jesusabdullah: yield is disgusting
[07:25] Bj_o_rn has joined the channel
[07:25] MooGoo: as a word I find it fairly neutral
[07:25] jesusabdullah: yield is only useful if you can't write multi-line lambdas imo

[07:25] hassox has joined the channel
[07:26] MooGoo: first off
[07:26] digiwano: seriously, amazing book, everyone go buy it 8)
[07:26] MooGoo: js needs function literal short hand
[07:26] digiwano: the pdf version has syntax coloring too, which is awesome
[07:26] MooGoo: then a lot of this stuff becomes more natural

[07:26] sechrist_ has joined the channel
[07:26] digiwano: i've been doin a lot in coffee lately for just that reason
[07:26] jesusabdullah: js definitely could use a nice function shorthand
[07:27] MooGoo: coffee goes too far
[07:27] rahul__ has joined the channel
[07:27] jesusabdullah: Why do you say that?
[07:27] digiwano: at jsconf brendan said he was going to propose coffee's ->/=> at the next js.next meeting
[07:27] MooGoo: it just...does
[07:27] MooGoo: it's a total different language
[07:27] jesusabdullah: NO GUT
[07:27] MooGoo: I just want one thing
[07:27] jesusabdullah: No gut feelings
[07:27] jesusabdullah: This is MAN STUFF, Dee!
[07:27] mscdex: no more flying solo!
[07:27] jesusabdullah: It *is* a different language
[07:27] Jalava: i wonder if there is any way to escape try / catch block so that if callback inside try catch is no longer catched if there is error
[07:27] MooGoo: nah functions should just be blocks
[07:27] MooGoo: no extra symbol
[07:27] jesusabdullah: Besides *that* (and, I mean, it's significant), I think the way coffeescript does things is reasonable
[07:28] MooGoo: var hello = { alert('hai') }
[07:28] MooGoo: that should be a function
[07:28] Jalava: because if i got try / catch for example db connection open, and it's callback continues by calling outer callback (pretty regular, right), then the outer callback is still inside try / catch block that is meant just for inner callback
[07:28] MooGoo: var hello = (arg){ alert(arg) }
[07:29] MooGoo: or that
[07:29] digiwano: MooGoo: tbh i think THAT's taking it too far
[07:29] digiwano: second one not so much
[07:29] MooGoo: why not
[07:29] DelvarWorld:  does anyone know offhandedly in node if it's faster to do string concatenation in a loop with str += or arr.push() then after loop arr.join()
[07:29] MooGoo: I guess you could require
[07:29] Aria: Awful hard to parse unambiguously there.
[07:29] MooGoo: params
[07:29] MooGoo: there's always issues like that
[07:29] sorens3n: alright, out for the night
[07:29] MooGoo: js is complex
[07:29] sorens3n: Aria: sorry if i offended you
[07:29] MooGoo: it can be done
[07:29] sorens3n: got a little heated earlier
[07:30] Aria: DelvarWorld: Don't know offhand, I'd not be surprised if it depends on the size of the strings. Internally, v8 stores them as chords, so it keeps them in medium-size pieces.
[07:30] MooGoo: you shall not be forgiven
[07:30] Jalava: such as function(cb) { try { db.open('foo', function(err) { if(err) { throw err} else return cb(null); }) }catch(err){ cb(err, null) }}
[07:30] digiwano: MooGoo: either way, i think we'll end up seeing () -> { return foo; }
[07:30] Druide_ has joined the channel
[07:30] MooGoo: I guess I'll live
[07:30] Jalava: problem is that if anything after cb(null) has exception, it's catched by try/catch block ;)
[07:30] MooGoo: no implicit return?
[07:30] digiwano: which is entirely better than function(){}
[07:30] digiwano: all over the goddamned place
[07:32] MooGoo: ok
[07:32] MooGoo: but why not have a keyword like
[07:32] MooGoo: var html = wait get(url)
[07:32] MooGoo: or something
[07:32] [AD]Turbo has joined the channel
[07:32] Aria: Because then you're maintaining a whole stack.

[07:33] MooGoo: it'd stay non blocking
[07:33] Aria: Anyway. Night, all!
[07:33] Aria: Yeah, but non-blocking doesn't imply stack-unwinding either. node does both.
[07:33] Aria: For better or worse. Nice on the memory use front though.
[07:33] MooGoo: ill think about this
[07:33] Aria: Night!

[08:06] jesusabdullah: pandark_: If you link it to me I can take a looksee and let you know if I can figure out how to run the tests

[08:06] MooGoo: someone give me a code challenge
[08:07] digiwano: jesusabdullah: yeah its totally that, slc itself is about 50/50 normon/non-mormon, thats why i gave that figure
[08:07] ParadoxQuine: is there a quick command i could use to move all of my plugins to the npm -g location? i installed everything after updating and its in my home folder...
[08:07] digiwano: outside of slc its much more mormony than that
[08:07] digiwano: but it's weird, it's the closest the west has got to a bible belt
[08:08] jesusabdullah: heh
[08:08] jesusabdullah: I bet
[08:08] jesusabdullah: I had the feeling that SLC was too metropolitan for most of the fundies
[08:09] digiwano: well most of the super mormon types live in fancy ass carbon copy houses suburbia
[08:09] jesusabdullah: pandark_: I don't recognize any obvious test harness here. The test file is written in ruby, oddly enough!
[08:10] digiwano: nearer to downtown tends to be more liberal-ish, but theres still the heavy mormon presence even there
[08:10] digiwano: most people get along but

[08:32] jesusabdullah: Actually, the first time bot-writing actually Made Sense to me was with node
[08:32] jesusabdullah: it's perfect for writing bots
[08:32] MooGoo: on punch cards, just to be sure
[08:32] jesusabdullah: because so much of IRC is event-based
[08:32] MooGoo: yes
[08:32] MooGoo: like this one guy
[08:32] digiwano: yeah i really need to switch my robot
[08:32] MooGoo: talking about how his eggdrop bot was so great
[08:33] jesusabdullah: I looked into eggdrop
[08:33] MooGoo: and every time it tried to scrape data off of twitter
[08:33] jesusabdullah: It's in tcl :(
[08:33] jesusabdullah: and, also
[08:33] jesusabdullah: also
[08:33] digiwano: and seriously just git rid of most of that atrocious perl codebase
[08:33] MooGoo: it would stall up for 15 min while twitter broke
[08:33] jesusabdullah: its config is ridiculous
[08:33] digiwano: but i like Hailo too much to completely abandon it
[08:33] jesusabdullah: digiwano: Why you hatin' on perl? ;)
[08:33] jesusabdullah: hah
[08:33] `3rdEden: mjr_ NIH syndrome :(
[08:33] jesusabdullah: While I don't know much perl, I've seen some awesome shit done with it
[08:33] MooGoo: nodejs seems faster even when the network response is quick
[08:33] jesusabdullah: I want to learn it someday
[08:33] digiwano: i've written awesome shit in it
[08:34] digiwano: just not this robot

[08:35] digiwano: got unmanageable and i hate most of the code
[08:35] jesusabdullah: MooGoo: Yeah well the bot I have to work with exposes the relevant parts of node-irc over dnode, so
[08:35] jesusabdullah: that's how I'm rollin'
[08:35] jesusabdullah: unless I wanna gut the entire corporate bawt
[08:35] jesusabdullah: and that's not how I roll!
[08:35] digiwano: wanna just set up the multi-brain backend in perl, connect to it via node and do all of the actual irc/twitter/aim in node
[08:35] MooGoo: your bot needs to reload modules without restarting
[08:35] jesusabdullah: Also, dnode rox
[08:35] MooGoo: and be resistent to exceptions and syntax errors
[08:35] `3rdEden: Y use moose in perl all the cool kids use anyevent ;D

[08:38] jesusabdullah: AvianFlu: Yeah? Where are you guys at with that?
[08:39] AvianFlu: #kohai, lol
[08:39] slicky: I think I might write some plugins for kohai

[08:39] slicky: the project has definitely got me interested
[08:39] jesusabdullah: AvianFlu: I'm moving/road tripping over the course of this month, but I'd be happy to keep an eye

[08:41] mscdex: not me!
[08:42] MooGoo: everybody who counts loves ned flanders
[08:42] slicky: Twitter users are robots, so I thought for a while we could trust them. Unfortunately, I forgot that skynet came online a while ago.
[08:42] mscdex: like counts lines of code or what?
[08:43] digiwano: when i was first testing my grammar engine i tried feeding it twitter's raw trending topics
[08:43] digiwano: most of the time i couldnt tell the robot-generated sentences from the twitter ones
[08:43] mscdex: skynet.js

[10:34] Jalava: problem with try / catch is that if i use callbacks, all exceptions are catched by previous try / catch block :)

[13:04] jonaslund: lukstr: cygwin uses /cygdrive/... paths
[13:04] jonaslund: lukstr: but has all the cygwin bullshit
[13:04] lukstr: sriley: one sec
[13:05] jonaslund: mingw has bla\bla\ paths
[13:05] jonaslund: so that might confuse code for people
[13:05] lukstr: sriley: from the installation wiki: There are two ways of building Node on Windows. One is over the Cygwin emulation layer the other is using MinGW (GNU toolchain for windows). See the Cygwin and MinGW pages.

[13:06] sriley: you can, doesnt mean its a good idea though imo
[13:06] lukstr: it USED to be that Cygwin was better supported but I was under the impression MinGW had become better, and so I asked so that I can know, so that I can recommend. I don't really care if it's a good idea or not

[13:07] lukstr: you can use mingw and pretend you're in a unix environment and it works just fine

[14:10] captain_morgan has joined the channel
[14:11] justinw312: Soon it'll support webworkers, which will give you a non-blocking way of doing time consuming operations
[14:11] miccolis: razvandme: https://gist.github.com/995320
[14:11] justinw312: matias: which is why almost none of the functionality in node is blocking
[14:12] Matias: I know but the question is if you block absolutely everything for all users all around the World or just the part of the server handling your requests
[14:12] justinw312: matias: Node is single-threaded, you would block everyone connect

[14:14] justinw312: matias: There is planned support for webworkers, so you can launch a new thread with that once it is supported, which would call a callback when complete wihtout blocking your node process

[14:15] razvandme: miccolis: thanks!
[14:15] justinw312: "The fundamentals of scalable systems are fast networking and non-blocking design—the rest is message passing. In future versions, Node will be able to fork new processes (using the http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-workers/current-work/) which fits well into the current design."

[14:18] pandeiro: i guess i could store the element in a variable and then output it unescaped but that is kind of an ugly workaround...
[14:18] baudehlo: in favour of: https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/child_process.js#L62
[14:19] justinw312: Well you could always launch another instance of node, sent it serialized function, and have it send back the result. 
[14:19] justinw312: send
[14:19] bingomanatee: Web Workers is Digital Exploitation!
[14:19] baudehlo: combine fork() with dnode (http://substack.net/posts/85e1bd/DNode-Asynchronous-Remote-Method-Invocation-for-Node-js-and-the-Browser) and you've got everything you need.

[14:21] justinw312: I'm betting exec()ing a string really ruins the VM performance and adds a lot of overhead. Having to parse and compile the string.
[14:22] Matias: I guess you always can use webservice instead of webworkers to do specific tasks with Node.js
[14:22] Matias: can always*
[14:22] justinw312: So it would probably make more sense to have the functinons already in the worker rather than trying to serialize them
[14:22] baudehlo: right. You pass in commands not functions.
[14:23] baudehlo: see dnode.

[14:23] justinw312: Buuuut, I still think the fact you could send arbitrary functions is awesome.

[14:45] tbranyen: yeah 100,000 users hitting a single value in the process is going to scale hella better than pulling from some datasource elsewhere requiring i/o

[14:46] baudehlo: tbranyen: no I mean it doesn't "scale" at all. You're talking about performance.
[14:46] Matias: I mean, a problem there*
[14:47] Matias: what happens if two users wants to change the value of a variable at the same time?
[14:47] Matias: I guess they are not blocked until the other one has finished
[14:47] tbranyen: baudehlo: i guess i don't understand how thousands of users hitting a service doesn't deal with scalability
[14:47] baudehlo: it doesn't scale to cluster. It doesn't scale to multiple servers.
[14:47] tbranyen: we're talking about different things and its :-p
[14:47] baudehlo: Matias: there is no "at the same time" in node.
[14:47] Matias: no?

[16:30] merlinm: its not
[16:30] lukstr: "I'm increasingly convinced this asynchronous callback style of programming is too difficult for most developers to manage," Robinson said. "Without extreme discipline it can easily lead to 'callback hell,' with deeply nested callbacks and complex code to implement logic that would be simple on a synchronous platform."

[16:31] KirinDave: Man this article is schizophrenic.
[16:31] Bradleymeck: lighter in which aspect, in terms of memory, almost guaranteed. in terms of io, sometimes, concurrency, depends.

[16:42] lukstr: rbranson: that would make sense as they are mainstream typed languages
[16:42] rbranson: except they are shit languages
[16:43] merlinm: my experience in with C, that has gone from kinda sorta weakly typed language to kinda sorta strongly typed language (via compiler tech) is that it has been for the better 
[16:43] lukstr: well, I like C
[16:43] rbranson: C is weakly typed
[16:43] joshthecoder: huh?
[16:43] rbranson: I've never been like "damn the C type system is really getting me down"
[16:43] merlinm: rbranson: depends -- with warings and -Wall not so much

[16:43] merlinm: *warnings 
[16:43] rbranson: more like shit I just spend 3 hours valgrinding this code for a mem leak
[16:44] merlinm: yup
[16:44] Bradleymeck: if you have static typing, i dont want type coersion (strings with toString).  sensible type system can go either way , just dont be hypocritical, predicatability is best (that does not mean knowing the type though)
[16:44] lukstr: I'm not saying strong typing is bad, I just don't miss it in this instance :)
[16:44] tjholowaychuk: c > c++
[16:45] lukstr: tjholowaychuk: though I do like templates :P
[16:45] Bradleymeck: tjholowaychuk, you dont like templated generics in macros with RIIA
[16:45] Bradleymeck: ?
[16:45] rbranson: C++ is a seductive temptress on the path to destruction
[16:45] lukstr: rbranson: but that's what makes it so fun
[16:45] merlinm: lukstr: agree 100% -- c++ is bloated mess, but stl is cool
[16:45] joshthecoder: C++ = C with templates
[16:45] tjholowaychuk: cpp macros could be a lot nicer but i dont really like anything else about c++
[16:45] lukstr: merlinm: stepanov would like you
[16:46] tim_smart: V8 is pretty nice C++
[16:46] rbranson: V8 is probably the best C++ code I have ever seen
[16:46] rbranson: unless you are that good, just use C or Java
[16:46] scm_ has joined the channel
[16:46] lukstr: rbranson: you mean, unless you are that good just don't talk to me? :P
[16:47] tjholowaychuk: c is brutal too if you just suck at writing clean code

[16:47] merlinm: the other thing i miss with c++ is raii 
[16:47] rbranson: lukstr: I am not that good :D
[16:47] jetienne: C is less scalable due to its lack of object stuf
[16:47] jtillmann has joined the channel
[16:47] lukstr: tjholowaychuk: but it gives you plenty of room to breath and set things up a way you like, I like that about it
[16:47] joshthecoder: jetienne not sure I entirely agree
[16:47] merlinm: C's biggest failing (to me) is horribale concurrency models 
[16:47] rbranson: tjholowaychuk: that's a lot easier than the kind of mental model required to deal with with multiply inheriting templated classes
[16:47] joshthecoder: harder to scale maybe
[16:47] jetienne: you end up with sillyLongNAme
[16:48] tjholowaychuk: rbranson yeah
[16:48] lukstr: rbranson: you don't like the curiously recurring template?
[16:48] tjholowaychuk: i dont appreciate magic
[16:48] jetienne: tjholowaychuk: c++ is like js, may be abused, but not that bad when you know the good parts
[16:48] rbranson: hahaha
[16:48] rbranson: JS is abused by morons, C++ is abused by smart people
[16:48] tjholowaychuk: overloading for statically typed stuff is kinda nice but not for operators
[16:48] lukstr: I've always said C++ gives you a lot of firepower to shoot yourself in the foot with
[16:49] jetienne: i wrote 350 000 lines of c++ in a single project, but i wont do it again :)
[16:49] merlinm: the big issue with c++ is the oo inspiration for the language was highly flawed IMO (also but java and C# in that bucket)
[16:50] jetienne: i wrote 350 000 lines of c+https://github.com/jeromeetienne/neoip/tree/master/src <- for the p2p monster of mine :)
[16:50] jslatts: hey all you c++ wizards: how can i pass a function pointer to a member of an instance of a class?
[16:50] jbpros has joined the channel
[16:50] Bradleymeck: typedef it
[16:50] jetienne: silly cutpaste
[16:50] lukstr: jslatts: I have a few classes which do that with templates
[16:50] jslatts: i am trying to do &(myClassInstance->*.someMember)
[16:50] jetienne: Bradleymeck: +1
[16:51] jetienne: ->*. ?
[16:51] jslatts: but i get: cannot be used as a member pointer, since it is of type ‘<unresolved overloaded function type>’
[16:51] rbranson: !)_$!(
[16:51] jslatts: err, no.
[16:51] lukstr: jslatts: you need the instance and the class method
[16:51] jbpros has joined the channel
[16:51] lukstr: in a functor
[16:51] rbranson: jesus that is some fucked syntax
[16:51] context: does anyone have the google cache /url for that ibm article
[16:51] rbranson: is there even a way to call a function like that in C++?
[16:51] jetienne: jslatts:  *.someMember is unreal
[16:51] lukstr: rbranson: ?
[16:51] jslatts: lukstr: the . is not right
[16:51] rbranson: a function pointer bound to an instance?
[16:52] lukstr: rbranson: yes
[16:52] merlinm: unless its static 
[16:52] jslatts: yes, i have an external library that takes a func ptr for a callback
[16:52] rbranson: don't you need a trampoline to setup the calling convention properly?
[16:52] lukstr: yes-ish
[16:52] jslatts: and I want to pass it an instance member so I can access the object state when it calls back
[16:52] rbranson: just make it static then
[16:52] lukstr: you need a framework to set it up and make it pretty
[16:53] rbranson: yeah you'd have to generate per-instance stub code to call it
[16:53] jslatts: rbranson: then i don't get the state around the object when it assigned it
[16:53] rbranson: sux
[16:53] lukstr: it's nice to say x = callThisLater(someObject, SomeType::someFunction, someParameters);
[16:53] jslatts: unless i am missing something
[16:53] merlinm: i am very skeptical about this kind of language acrobatisc 
[16:53] jslatts: lukstr: by framework you mean some additional library that handles that for me?
[16:54] rbranson: the external library should give you a way to pass a "cookie" pointer that it'll pass back to your callback function
[16:54] lukstr: jslatts: yes
[16:54] rbranson: otherwise it is a piece of shit library
[16:54] jslatts: lukstr: like a pseudo-closure type of deal?
[16:54] lukstr: haha yeah I guess? very pseudo
[16:54] jslatts: rbranson: yes. i think you are dead on
[16:54] Bradleymeck: context : http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:4rp2x5ldS2oJ:www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/javascript-conquers-the-server-969+%22javascript+conquers+the+server%22&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&source=www.google.com ?
[16:54] lukstr: rbranson: that's pretty much how I do it
[16:54] rbranson: so in that case you can just use a static function
[16:54] rbranson: that's how node-ffi does it
[16:54] KirinDave: Okay we need to stop linking this shit.
[16:54] lukstr: you could but it's nice if you can use _any_ class
[16:55] jslatts: but I don't see why I can't pass a function pointer from my class instance?
[16:55] Bradleymeck: kirindave, someone asked this time
[16:55] KirinDave: Every time you link that article god rips the ears off a puppy.
[16:55] eyesUnclouded has joined the channel

[18:32] chrischris has joined the channel
[18:32] `3rdEden: c4milo depends on the service, as your clients need to be able to connect to your server with a socket.io compatible client as Socket.IO uses its own protocol specification, and send heartbeats across the stream

[21:42] jmoyers: async version immediately yields the execution context and then calls the callback when io is ready
[21:42] jiggliemon: yeah, I was trying to write to a buffer etc - and form a callback based on the buffer's state.

[21:47] jmoyers: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.8/api/fs.html#fs.readFile
[21:48] jmoyers: line by line and such you can create a readStream

[21:48] jiggliemon: jmoyers: I was reading the contents of a directory - and parsing them.
[21:48] jmoyers: ah
[21:49] jiggliemon: then saving the rendered content to a buffer to write to a cache file.

[21:57] SubStack: browserify >= 0.4.6 now takes a hash argument for require so you can map names like this: { jquery : 'jquery-browserify' }
[21:58] SubStack: and it's now intelligent about aliasing too so if you depend on hashish elsewhere and then alias hashish to h it won't inline the source twice

[21:59] SubStack: devaholic: you're ALREADY using dnode with browserify
[21:59] SubStack: dnode uses browserify internally
[21:59] devaholic: yeah i know, thats why i ask
[22:00] devaholic: seems like i cannot also use browserify in the standard way, if im using dnode
[22:00] SubStack: if you include dnode in the require param then you can just require('dnode') browser-side
[22:00] SubStack: then instead of <script src="/dnode.js"> you just <script src="/browserify.js">
[22:00] devaholic: ah, thats the ticket

[22:17] tjholowaychuk: our app is huge
[22:17] tjholowaychuk: and its still less than a second to reboot
[22:17] tjholowaychuk: IMO it's stupid to try and do it any other way
[22:17] tjholowaychuk: pointless effort
[22:17] matias: it's just not comfortable, I'm not talking about time :P
[22:18] tjholowaychuk: k, so just use something that reloads, you dont need to reload one module specifically
[22:18] matias: sure it doesn't make sense to implement anything to do that but I asked in case there was something, just to be sure
[22:18] tjholowaychuk: there are at least 5 or 6 modules that do it in different ways
[22:18] telemachus: tjholowaychuk: Can I ask you about a weird glitch with flash/sessions in Express?
[22:18] tjholowaychuk: telemachus sure
[22:18] telemachus: I think it's related to this: https://github.com/visionmedia/express/issues/656
[22:19] slickplaid: Anyone know of a project that uses nodejs to stream flash video to a client?
[22:19] matias: really? I just knew require! (I started today to learn about node.js)
[22:19] telemachus: This is a very silly, trivial app, but I'm essentially playing with Express/Node right now: https://gist.github.com/996249
[22:19] slickplaid: trying to think of the best way to stream flash after html5 fallback, not using red5 if possible.
[22:19] telemachus: I get frequent errors in the logs (though the app works) for the req.flash on line 89
[22:19] tjholowaychuk: matias: http://learnboost.github.com/cluster/
[22:19] tjholowaychuk: reload() plugin
[22:19] telemachus: not sure why, frankly - even before that route is hit
[22:19] tjholowaychuk: is what we use
[22:19] tjholowaychuk: since we use cluster anyway
[22:19] jmoyers: noduels is another, right
[22:20] jmoyers: all seems a little hairy to me.
[22:20] tjholowaychuk: cluster just restarts, nothing fancy, but it's more than fast enough
[22:20] jmoyers: restart is fine

[22:22] tjholowaychuk: np
[22:22] tjholowaychuk: not an obvious one no worries
[22:22] niftylettuce: tjholowaychuk: what is difference between mixin(n) and mixin_(n) naming convention for stylus? I noticed that I get a compilation n is null on mixin(n) if the mixin is not being used
[22:23] itissid has left the channel
[22:23] tjholowaychuk: niftylettuce which ones have a trailing underscore?
[22:23] tjholowaychuk: no difference but private stuff for me at least usually starts with -
[22:23] niftylettuce: tjholowaychuk: also the parser should convert \t to a space character so that noobs can mix tabs with spaces in their stylesheets
[22:24] tjholowaychuk: haha well you can use tabs or spaces, otherwise it wont work well
[22:24] niftylettuce: lol
[22:24] tjholowaychuk: because you have to decide how many spaces a tab is
[22:24] tjholowaychuk: visually it might not line up as expected
[22:24] niftylettuce: hehe :) yea i noticed when i used someone elses mixin and they had \t
[22:24] niftylettuce: tjholowaychuk: I built my own grid system for Stylus and tried using prepend(n) for # cols to prepend col with, and i didnt use prepend(n) in any of my actuak styles
[22:24] niftylettuce: actual *
[22:25] niftylettuce: then i changed it to prepend_(n) and it compiled with the middleware just fine
[22:25] tjholowaychuk: hm :s
[22:25] tjholowaychuk: that's odd
[22:25] niftylettuce: so it must be the "_" after var name lets it compile
[22:25] matias: by the way, the documentation says "In particular module.exports is the same as the exports object.", the problem is I tried to replace module.exports for exports in my code and it doesn't work the same way. I bet there's a subtle difference at least
[22:25] niftylettuce: try to duplicate issue perhaps

[22:37] isaacs: olalonde: in whatever package you want to require() it from

[23:12] jmoyers: well look at macos
[23:12] jmoyers: for the longest time
[23:12] jmoyers: 'there are no viruses for mac! ha! stupid windows!'
[23:12] jmoyers: then like what
[23:12] jmoyers: less than a month ago, a crimeware kit got released
[23:12] hermanjunge: All We have to do is posting on the 133t crews until we find one with interest on trying to break nodejs apps...
[23:12] LowValueTarget has joined the channel
[23:12] systemfault: shrug..
[23:13] tbranyen: hermanjunge: most people won't break bullshit apps, they want cred
[23:13] systemfault: Windows is secure... I hate it but it's the truth.
[23:13] saschagehlich has joined the channel
[23:13] jmoyers: systemfault ha
[23:13] jmoyers: you crazy
[23:13] addisonj: secure is relative
[23:13] tjholowaychuk: haha oh god
[23:13] tjholowaychuk: windows...
[23:13] jmoyers: pwn2own anyone?
[23:13] jmoyers: how about drive by complete control
[23:13] systemfault: I don't like it, I don't use it... but heh..
[23:13] tbranyen: i would love to pwn to own some open source
[23:14] jmoyers: shit, somebody even released a zero day for chrome on windows the other day
[23:14] hermanjunge: systemfault: I agree, they don't spend millions and millions for nothing. what happens is that when someone finds a vuln, he/she got a lot of media attention, and everybody starts crying Wolf
[23:14] davidbanham has joined the channel
[23:14] addisonj: pwn2own would probably be sort of a joke on node at this point
[23:14] DelvarWorld: i'm looking into making my own template language - is it likely that I will need to build a lexer and a parser, or can I get away with some regex approach? the template language will include things like for loops
[23:14] tbranyen: lol why do i have systemfault on ignore
[23:14] jmoyers: my pwn2own comment was wrt windows, not node
[23:15] systemfault: tbranyen: Can't remember
[23:15] jiggliemon has left the channel
[23:15] addisonj: jmoyers, yeah, got that, but was just thinking it might be interesting to see how node would perform under vulnerability testing
[23:15] jmoyers: addisonj++
[23:15] v8bot:  jmoyers has given a beer to addisonj. addisonj now has 1 beers.
[23:15] jmoyers: its quite early and all
[23:15] jmoyers: not even 1.0
[23:16] hermanjunge: metasloit on popular nodejs apps... anyone? L O L
[23:16] hermanjunge: metasploit*
[23:16] jmoyers: but still interesting since 'so many' (relatively small number) are using in production
[23:16] tbranyen: jmoyers: github is the largest site i know of using it
[23:16] systemfault: I'm glad there's better than Windows :)
[23:16] tbranyen: i'm sure other ones are
[23:16] jmoyers: github... what part of github?
[23:16] devaholic: what does github use node for
[23:16] jmoyers: github was a ruby shop
[23:16] hermanjunge: why everybody hates windows?

[23:17] nivoc has joined the channel
[23:17] addisonj: honestly though, if you are not running as root and have an up to date OS, probably not a huge risk, i bet there are buffer overflows to get the server to run code, but finding eselation vulnerabilities ain't no easy thing these days
[23:17] hermanjunge: what I do is setting a vmware ubuntu to node
[23:17] robmason has joined the channel
[23:17] mek||malloc: Hi folks, is there a way to get the window.location.href from jsdom.env? It keeps returning the path of my server side script.
[23:17] hermanjunge: the problem is everybody (in my env al least) uses at some point some windows stuff
[23:18] systemfault: hermanjunge: Example?
[23:18] hermanjunge: and Is hard to find linux equivalents on the run
[23:18] tbranyen: addisonj: shit is exploited every day... especially something as new and fragile as nodejs
[23:18] _aron has joined the channel
[23:18] tbranyen: who cares how up to date your os is, if you have unpatched software running on it
[23:18] addisonj: tbranyen, of course, but if your server is set up to mitigate that risk, its not as a big a deal
[23:19] hermanjunge: I tried a lot of times to arrive at work with a linux box, and end havin to read this CAD file, this PSD, this office thing that openOffice can't open, etc
[23:19] jmoyers: tbranyen interesting
[23:19] jmoyers: i read this, forgot about it
[23:19] tbranyen: yea
[23:19] systemfault: hermanjunge: Photoshop... yeah, it's unavoidable
[23:19] jmoyers: my questions were around whether this was getting proxied though
[23:19] tbranyen: hermanjunge: i use linux full time
[23:19] jmoyers: like an internal api call
[23:19] systemfault: hermanjunge: And linux doesn't have a real alternative.
[23:19] jmoyers: where its not exposed to the outside world at all
[23:19] tbranyen: if i need to open office files i use google docs
[23:19] hermanjunge: systemfault: I know there are good substitutes, but lack of time is cruel
[23:19] tbranyen: or openoffice
[23:19] jmoyers: made me think so, since he said he exposed it as a rest api
[23:20] tbranyen: psds open ... not well ... in gimp
[23:20] systemfault: hermanjunge: Nothing as mature, unfortunately.. For example, last time I checked, GIMP's CMYK's support was non existant
[23:20] hermanjunge: systemfault: at least in LA people are all on windows (Excepting of course, geeks)
[23:20] hermanjunge: LA = LatinAmerica
[23:20] systemfault: Ah ok
[23:20] systemfault: Canada here :P

[23:23] hermanjunge: systemfault: I was about to tell you that, Incomes are a half or a quarter, the equivalent to say, Canada, US
[23:23] brownies has joined the channel
[23:24] hermanjunge: So imported things seem expensive
[23:24] systemfault: Yeah, makes sense
[23:24] LowValueTarget has joined the channel
[23:24] systemfault: My wife's from Tunisia.. and everything imported cost about 25-30% more there.
[23:24] hermanjunge: A fine developer makes $US 12 an hour
[23:25] systemfault: Depends on the price of the food/rent
[23:25] hermanjunge: yes, food and rent are cheaper in a relative way
[23:25] systemfault: I mean, I wouldn't mind doing 10$/hour if I could buy a meal for 3$
[23:25] hermanjunge: 3$
[23:25] systemfault: Random number..
[23:25] hermanjunge: no, Lunch is about $7
[23:26] hermanjunge: well, I diverged (again)
[23:27] hermanjunge: So, It would be interesting, I think it would be a good idea to set up some "H4ck3rz " Team to try to test nodejs
[23:27] systemfault: :)
