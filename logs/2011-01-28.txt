[02:24] micheil: so, what I'd recommend is using a queue plus worker processes
[02:24] langworthy has joined the channel
[02:24] Fuld: Yes, that sounds right
[02:24] Fuld: To keep it simple now, it's just going to be one worker
[02:24] micheil: or, use webworkers, which do pretty much that in app.
[02:24] Fuld: *for now
[02:24] Fuld: No one has written a text serializer for js have they?
[02:24] micheil: yeah, so, the main process should be being talked to from python.
[02:25] micheil: then the worker should get feed the data from the main process
[02:26] ChrisPartridge: ryah: Thanks, I'll send something through today
[02:26] micheil: Fuld: someone probably has.
[02:26] Fuld: micheil: It basically needs to detect punctuation and spacing to chop up a bunch of text into a one-dimensionsal array of words
[02:26] micheil: oh, right.

[02:29] cloudhead: it's telling me unauthorized name or invalid password
[02:30] ryah: it should be fast most of the time
[02:30] micheil: split would probably use similar to boyer-moer or something?
[02:30] ryah: i guess they use it for the substring search
[02:30] micheil: in which case it would be possible to write an async one. but yeah, it should normally be fast

[04:20] ChrisPartridge: nooder: look at async.js
[04:21] ChrisPartridge: or any other flow control lib for that matter

[04:22] SubStack: Seq.ap(xs).mapEach(function (x) { moo(x, this) }).seq(function (xs) { console.dir(xs) })
[04:22] SubStack: like that?
[04:22] jesusabdullah: JSON.parse doesn't take a callback, does it?
[04:22] SubStack: oh wait, s/mapEach/parMap/ >_<
[04:22] SubStack: ACTION wrote seq, he should know these things
[04:22] jesusabdullah: Hah
[04:23] ChrisPartridge: SubStack: ah, Seq is more than what I thought
[04:24] slickplaid: one of the reasons it's a good idea to ask i suppose... that is going to save me a lot of time i think
[04:24] slickplaid: thank you ChrisPartridge, SubStack :D
[04:24] SubStack: ChrisPartridge: you can sneak a limit in too!
[04:24] SubStack: if you don't want too many async ops firing at once

[04:25] SubStack: oh goodness seq is so ugly inside

[04:26] ChrisPartridge: haha that's it
[04:26] jesusabdullah: Cute

[04:52] Fuld: ACTION doesn't want modules
[04:52] Fuld: (not for this small thing anyway)
[04:52] skm has joined the channel
[04:53] SubStack: Fuld: that seems a very silly way to do it!
[04:53] SubStack: just module.exports = ... or export.baz = ... and require() it!
[04:53] SubStack: modules in node are super simple
[04:53] SubStack: it's more work to eval() them yourself
[04:54] ChrisPartridge: eval is only 2 vowels away from evil!
[04:54] bingomanatee: 2?
[04:54] bingomanatee: whats the second on?
[04:54] bingomanatee: e?
[04:54] SubStack: aeiou

[04:58] creationix: when did setTImeout change?
[04:58] creationix: if you omit the second argument, it never fires
[04:59] onar_ has joined the channel
[05:00] ryah: creationix: hm...
[05:00] creationix: not sure what the spec says, but it is changed behavior
[05:00] creationix: I have some really old code that used setTimeout without a time to simulate nextTicks
[05:01] ryah: there have been several small changes to it. i'd need to git-bisect to find the cause
[05:01] creationix: it's not a big deal, I'm not sure what the desired behavior would be
[05:01] creationix: ACTION goes to read the spec
[05:02] ryah: well, however it works in the browser
[05:02] ryah: which i assume is "very short timeout"
[05:02] creationix: right, I assume it was the same as a 0 length
[05:02] shiawuen1 has joined the channel
[05:02] creationix: which is really about 10ms in most browsers
[05:03] creationix: hah, it's not part of the spec, it's a browser thing.  I knew that...
[05:03] sivy has joined the channel
[05:04] maod has joined the channel
[05:05] creationix: yeah, the second argument isn't optional, it doesn't say what the behavior should be in that case
[05:06] maod: anyone know how one can reset auth privileges for npm?  having publishing issues
[05:06] creationix: maod: if the problem is local, delete your .npmrc file and start over
[05:07] creationix: if it's on the server, you might have to bug isaacs
[05:07] bronson_ has joined the channel
[05:07] ChrisPartridge: maod: there are currently issues afaik
[05:07] maod: creationix: it would be on the server -- i published a package long time ago, and now i can't update it

[05:08] ChrisPartridge: maod: https://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues/issue/534
[05:08] maod: ChrisPartridge: oh, well i guess it must have been related.  I deleted my .npmrc so I probably have to recreate my account
[05:08] ryah: creationix: https://github.com/ry/node/issues/issue/593
[05:09] creationix: ryah: sounds good.  It's a tough call, but I think defaulting to 0 timeout is better than never fireing the timeout
[05:09] creationix: either way people shouldn't be doing it
[05:11] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[05:11] slickplaid: Has anyone written or know of a redis/express user auth system that is available for use?
[05:11] creationix: ryah: also while updating my unit tests I noticed that assert.deepEqual doesn't check the type
[05:11] creationix: it thinks {} and [] are equal
[05:12] creationix: an easy check is to do a === on the __proto__ of both objects

[05:18] creationix: ryah: does this mean that you're going to start using the issue tracker more?
[05:18] losing has joined the channel
[05:19] ryah: creationix: yes
[05:19] creationix: cool
[05:20] creationix: ryah: did we ever find out what was causing my https server to hang as soon as there was back-pressure from the client?
[05:20] creationix: or should I file a ticket?
[05:21] ryah: creationix: no - i sent you an email
[05:21] admc has joined the channel
[05:21] ryah: i added a test trying to find it
[05:22] ryah: but i couldn't get it to blow up
[05:22] SubStack: Fuld: hooray! \o/
[05:22] creationix: cool
[05:22] creationix: ryah: fwiw, I couldn't reproduce it over localhost, only when the client was across the internet
[05:23] creationix: and the point at which it hung changed every time
[05:23] micheil: creationix: a bit more then website clean-up day.. I think :)
[05:23] creationix: but strangely in sawtooth patterns
[05:23] creationix: just like tcp backoff patterns
[05:23] shiawuen has joined the channel
[05:24] micheil: ryah: Revert "Use html5 spec stylesheet for docs" 
[05:24] micheil: ?
[05:25] micheil: ryah: is that to-do with the code blocks?
[05:25] creationix: I'm not sure how to reproduce the problem in a unit test.  It requires the client to not accept the packets right away
[05:26] creationix: or cause backpressure somehow
[05:27] micheil: client.pause?
[05:27] creationix: what does that do exactly?
[05:28] micheil: stops reading on the socket, iirc.
[05:28] ryanfitz has joined the channel

[05:32] creationix: ACTION wishes he had dtrace
[05:33] creationix: is there a dtrace capable os that runs on netbooks
[05:33] creationix: hackintosh or some open solaris distro?
[05:35] micheil: doesn't dtrace run on ubuntu or solaris?
[05:36] creationix: not linux
[05:36] creationix: and if you ever want a good laugh, ask bcantrell about dtrace on linux
[05:37] creationix: and ubuntu is the only thing I can reliably get running on random laptops
[05:38] killfill has joined the channel

[05:42] creationix: what are the chances that will run?
[05:43] creationix: but I bet it will have dtrace
[05:43] Aria: About the same as OpenSolaris running ;-)
[05:43] Aria: What with the same kernel and all.
[05:44] Aria: That said, if you want access to a solaris shell, I'd be happy to give you a login.
[05:44] Aria: s/solaris/OpenIndiana/
[05:44] Lorentz: Could always VM it, no?
[05:44] creationix: no, my home machine is a netbook
[05:44] creationix: VMs are too heavy
[05:45] Lorentz: Hrm
[05:45] creationix: if only Joyent made a laptop distro
[05:45] Lorentz: Well, mine isn't exactly a supercomputer either. Just an ordinary thinkpad.
[05:45] Lorentz: It's not that bad running virtualbox, just needs some more RAM than usual.

[06:03] creationix: I submitted three
[06:03] Aria: (the good part.) ... the bad parts were written in a doctor's waiting room.

[06:32] mjr_: well then, sure.  That fires off a bunch of queries without waiting for the previous one to finish.
[06:33] nooder: mjr_, but then i need results from all of them. how i can do it without globals?
[06:34] butu5: hmm I downloaded the http://nodejs.org/dist/node-v0.2.6.tar.gz looks like it is configuring
[06:34] butu5: from github something is broken

[06:34] curtischambers has joined the channel
[06:34] curtischambers has left the channel
[06:34] Aria: Or you wrap the thing in a closure and use a variable inside the closure to keep it from being global.
[06:34] mjr_: Basically your callback either closes over some var where you stash teh results, or else you stash them in some global var.
[06:35] mscdex: ugh... cygwin on a netbook is so slow
[06:35] mscdex: hah
[06:35] butu5: configure went successfully :)

[10:30] mape: stagas: k
[10:30] SubStack: awesome, node-graphviz exists
[10:30] piscisaureus: ryah: junction points are the most practical I think, and they should be useful for e.g. npm
[10:31] ryah: what's the differnce between all these?
[10:31] ryah: does socket.io work on the new https server?
[10:31] ryah: i can't get it to run
[10:31] piscisaureus: erm. Well a directory symlink and a junction point can only point to a directory, and a file link can only point to a file
[10:32] piscisaureus: Junction points require the target to exist at time of creation
[10:32] stagas: mape: maybe wrapping the process.stdout.write method? :)
[10:32] piscisaureus: the other types require elevation under default configuration (that is soooo lame btw)
[10:32] piscisaureus: (to create them, that is)
[10:33] piscisaureus: to create a junction point u need to use a very lame API

[10:46] |sWORDs|: I'm building a controller (gateway for all domotica capable devices) which will have TCPClients (tcpclient.js) a Server (gateway.js) and ofcourse the main (controller.js). So I probably could wrap them.
[10:46] slaskis: JSON.parse() keeps telling me syntaxerror on this: https://gist.github.com/334047d8393e0441d5b2 but i can't see what's wrong in it, anyone else with a keen eye?
[10:47] slaskis: i wish it was a little bit more helpful
[10:47] slaskis: jsonlint.com says its valid as well..
[10:48] |sWORDs|: slaskis it's valid javascript
[10:48] RushPL: is there in easy way to introduce constant artificial lag for node.js?
[10:48] slaskis: does it run in repl for you?
[10:48] RushPL: maybe with also adding some random jitter
[10:49] slaskis: i just run JSON.parse('the string in the gist') in node repl
[10:49] |sWORDs|: but why did you put it in as an array? you could try to remove the brackets
[10:49] RushPL: |sWORDs|: that's quite easy.
[10:50] RushPL: hm, but you have to modify that target file a bit
[10:50] slaskis: sometimes it's more than one entry
[10:50] |sWORDs|: maybe the parse doesn't like an array with only one item?
[10:51] slaskis: same thing without the []
[10:51] RushPL: for example if it has "var SomeClass = function() {  classBody }; " it has to have "module.exports = SomeClass and later you can do "global.SomeClass = SomeClass" which will get exported to all files
[10:51] RushPL: and with all the other symbols you can set them in global as well
[10:51] |sWORDs|: RushPL I'll have a go withit.

[10:52] |sWORDs|: mape, you're to fast
[10:53] |sWORDs|: just figured that out aswell ;)
[10:53] |sWORDs|: It worked without the body
[10:53] RushPL: |sWORDs|: I'm sharing some .js files with the browser client-side js and thus I have something like function globalInclude(className)  {var something = require(className); global[className] = something; } - but I would imagine it could be made much more universal
[10:54] |sWORDs|: RushPL: Where did you put it? I'd love a peak.
[10:55] RushPL: actually it's almost literally this function since I only have a need to globally include my classes.
[10:55] |sWORDs|: Ok, tnx!
[10:55] slaskis: mape: |sWORDs| yeah, jsonlint complained about body first. it seems it didn't fix it though

[10:56] slaskis: mape: no :(
[10:56] |sWORDs|: But slaskis, it works without the body for you aswell?
[10:56] mape: did you try doing it to the gist in repl?
[10:57] slaskis: |sWORDs|: well yes, but that's where the good stuff is ;)
[10:57] |sWORDs|: I know, but simply put a small thing in there and keep adding things until it breaks
[10:58] |sWORDs|: You might have to escape even more
[10:58] slaskis: it worked in repl as you said mape, but running it from the tumblr api didn't. sorry, i wasn't very clear
[10:58] mape: k
[10:59] slaskis: and i don't dare to do a whitelist regexp to clean stuff up, it'll be international characters in there eventually
[10:59] slaskis: strange that JSON.stringify on that string doesn't fix it
[10:59] slaskis: it should make it JSON parsable 
[10:59] mape: Probly better of telling tumblr to fix their JSON output if there is something wrong with it
[11:00] slaskis: actually, parsing their json works. but it's when i convert it into the format i want and save it back it fails
[11:00] mape: Oh k
[11:00] slaskis: mape: good point though, it must be i doing something wrong then
[11:01] slaskis: i'm cleaning it by converting it to/from markdown, might be something from there

[12:09] Evet: ryah: why dont you use nginx as event-loop and networking base?
[12:09] jetienne: :)
[12:10] chapel: why use nginx?
[12:10] chapel: what does it provide that something node specific couldn't?
[12:11] Evet: chapel: stability, performance?
[12:11] chapel: but wouldn't it behoove node to develop its own best of breed solutions for that?
[12:12] chapel: instead of adopting something like nginx that has a lot of problems
[12:12] Evet: chapel: could you rephrase?
[12:13] chapel: well nginx has its own problems and limitations
[12:13] unomi has joined the channel
[12:13] Evet: chapel: what kinda?
[12:13] chapel: if node adopted it as a foundation, then node would have those limitations
[12:13] chapel: http 1.0 instead of 1.1
[12:13] chapel: ie no websockets
[12:13] jetienne: ?
[12:14] jetienne: node as no websocket either
[12:14] chapel: node does websockets
[12:14] jetienne: but it is irrelevant
[12:14] Evet: chapel: http server is just a module of nginx
[12:14] chapel: socket.io
[12:14] chapel: eh
[12:14] Evet: and yeah, it sucks
[12:14] jetienne: chapel: look socket.io and look node. and see how they are != projects :)
[12:14] chapel: if node were just being started, maybe you could ask for something like that
[12:14] jetienne: nginx is a webserver. node.js is a script langauge
[12:15] jetienne: just nothing related
[12:15] Evet: nginx isnt a webserver at all
[12:15] jetienne: Evet: ok you win

[12:17] Evet: chapel: what makes nodejs instable?
[12:17] SubStack: jetienne: https://github.com/substack/npmdep 
[12:17] chapel: node isn't unstable
[12:17] chapel: the reason 0.3.x is 'unstable' is because its changing
[12:18] chapel: not because it will crash (though it could, as with anything)
[12:18] chapel: but there are plenty of examples where good code has had insane up times
[12:18] Evet: dont people use nginx front of node?
[12:18] garrensmith has joined the channel
[12:19] chapel: so dont take the term unstable to mean it crashes all the time
[12:19] chapel: Evet: some people do
[12:19] chapel: some dont
[12:19] chapel: you dont need to
[12:19] chapel: you could run a node proxy in front just as easily
[12:19] chapel: or run your own solution that is specific to your app
[12:20] ErikCorry: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#Development_model <-- I think this is where the 'unstable' tag comes from.

[12:23] chapel: why use spidermonkey instead of google v8?
[12:23] jetienne: Evet: are you doing a homework or something ?
[12:24] Evet: because spidermonkey is worse than v8
[12:24] SubStack: why use v8 instead of netscape 3's javascript engine?
[12:24] SubStack: why use vi instead of emacs?
[12:25] Evet: im asking you
[12:25] jetienne: maybe this is it. Evet is trying to trigger a troll
[12:25] Evet: there is a reason to use v8, right?
[12:25] jetienne: Evet: yes
[12:26] shiawuen has joined the channel
[12:26] Evet: so, why use ryah's libev implementation instead of nginx?
[12:26] jetienne: Evet: because
[12:27] jetienne: mysql instead of v8 has never been considered either
[12:27] Evet: it makes some people use nginx front of node
[12:27] Evet: its funny like, we're using another javascript engine front of node
[12:28] chapel: Evet: if you were to throw the js logic you put in node into nginx, it would need a proxy in front of it as well
[12:28] chapel: and the reason people put nginx in front of node is not because node can't handle load, its because they want to load balance between multiple node processes
[12:28] chapel: but you can use node to do that
[12:29] chapel: or apache if you like to torture yourself
[12:29] jetienne: or mysql
[12:29] jetienne: or any other software
[12:29] eikke: ACTION would use nginx in front of node to serve static media as well
[12:30] chapel: well there is that
[12:30] chapel: but I am sure node could handle static files as good or better than nginx eventually
[12:30] Evet: nginx has a in-memory database to balance load
[12:30] jetienne: Evet: mysql too
[12:30] chapel: Evet: node could do the same thing
[12:31] jetienne: Evet: photoshop too!!!
[12:31] Evet: chapel: so, would you use ryah's javascript parser instead of v8?
[12:31] jetienne: hehe this guy is strange
[12:31] jetienne: Evet: seriously read more
[12:31] chapel: I think ryah knows what he is doing, and I trust where he is taking node
[12:31] chapel: if you dont like node
[12:31] chapel: go use something else
[12:31] Evet: fanboy alert.
[12:32] jetienne: and ryah hasnt written a js parser :)
[12:32] chapel: Evet: you're in #node.js

[12:33] mnbvasd: argument or discussion?
[12:33] jetienne: i think it is a bot
[12:35] Evet: nodejs uses v8 because its better than spidermonkey? is there a reason to use ryah's implementation instead of nginx (a better solution)?
[12:35] chapel: you say its a better solution
[12:35] chapel: but that doesn't mean you are right
[12:36] Evet: what makes nodejs' networking and event-loop stuff better than nginx'

[14:28] CrazyGoogle: cpu is on one core at 100%
[14:28] ErikCorry: I wonder if export "CCFLAGS=-fno-strict-aliasing" helps you
[14:28] booths_: Iskren: Your best bet might be to send a message to the client to call disconnect from their side. I looked through real quick and didn't see a disconnect method.
[14:29] Evet_ has joined the channel
[14:29] jimt has joined the channel
[14:29] ErikCorry: Sorry the export is part of the command
[14:29] ErikCorry: The quotes are not
[14:29] CrazyGoogle: looks like that
[14:30] iskren: booths_, ok, the reason I'm asking is because if I call disconnect from the client my last message gets dropped
[14:30] CrazyGoogle: ErikCorry: yeah, i know how to pass Flags to compiler :D
[14:30] iskren: booths_, so I decided to send a message to the server to disconnect me, so now I should return it back ... omfg :)
[14:31] booths_: iskren: So you want to force disconnect IE to stop them from receiving messages?
[14:31] CrazyGoogle: ErikCorry: is that something wrong on my side, or in build system ?
[14:31] booths_: iskren: I'm not sure if this will fuck something up, but theoretically you could remove the sessionid from socket.clients. I believe that will leave it out of any messages.
[14:31] iskren: I want to send a message from the client, and then disconnect, but if I : "socket.send(), socket.disconnect()", then that last message gets dropped (FF)
[14:32] CrazyGoogle: ErikCorry: with CCFLAGS=-fno-strict-aliasing compilation done nicely
[14:32] ErikCorry: You have a very new gcc.
[14:32] ErikCorry: Every
[14:33] ErikCorry: time gcc gets smarter we have to get more careful with the strict aliasing analysis.
[14:33] ErikCorry: It inlines more and makes wrong assumptions.

[14:38] |sWORDs|: I'm using sys.puts from an example but get Cannot call method 'puts' of undefined. Did it change in later versions of Node.js?
[14:38] CrazyGoogle: ErikCorry: not that node.js leak memory where it isnt suspected

[14:41] kristsk: do you have a 'var util = require("util");'
[14:42] CrazyGoogle: var util = require('util');
[14:42] booths_: till_: You can send messages without having received. You should be able to just do socket.broadcast(message, [except])
[14:42] CrazyGoogle: util.puts("hallo world");
[14:42] |sWORDs|: yes, I've got that line
[14:42] Gruni has joined the channel
[14:42] kristsk: require("util").puts("Hallow world");
[14:42] kristsk: how about this.
[14:45] |sWORDs|: that line works, but not with require('util') in a var
[14:45] |sWORDs|: really strange, I do it with all other requires aswell
[14:47] kristsk: somthing wierd is going on there
[14:47] kristsk: it does not work even if you do require exacltly before puts() ?
[14:48] till_: booths_: thanks, i'll check that out
[14:49] |sWORDs|: no it does work with require on the same line
[14:50] |sWORDs|: just not when the require('util') is in a variable, but 'net' does work 
[14:50] kristsk: umm.
[14:50] kristsk: which version of node are you using?
[14:50] kristsk: 0.3.x or 0.2.x ?
[14:51] |sWORDs|: 0.3.1
[14:51] saschagehlich: hm try var util = require("util"); console.log(util);
[14:52] jetienne: > var util = require("util"); console.log(util);
[14:52] jetienne: 2

[14:53] |sWORDs|: var util = require("util"); console.log(util); gives no output
[14:53] saschagehlich: jetienne: okay, util is not available in 0.2 I guess
[14:53] gflarity has joined the channel
[14:53] saschagehlich: but maybe there has been a util module anyway, dunno realle
[14:53] saschagehlich: *really

[14:54] jetienne: > require("util")
[14:54] jetienne: 2
[14:54] jetienne: what is the npm command to know the locally installed package ?
[14:54] tiemonster: piscisaureus: ping
[14:55] till_: booths_: awesome, that did the trick. any suggestion on how to figure out the socket.io api? :) i've been looking at the code and it's not too documented.
[14:55] jetienne: npm list installed

[14:57] kristsk: 2 means "not found" afaik
[14:58] kristsk: ENOTFOUND or what was its name
[14:58] CrazyGoogle: does 0.3.1 already hat util ?
[14:58] CrazyGoogle: require('sys') ?
[14:58] jetienne: kristsk: i guess a exception would be more suitable than a errno :)
[14:58] kristsk: well in repl this kinda makes sense

[15:33] jeromegn: bradleymeck: this represents the twitter account model

[15:37] losing has joined the channel
[15:38] bradleymeck: crazygoogle thats not it, the question is why does tweet.text become undefined

[15:38] gflarity has joined the channel
[15:39] CrazyGoogle: bradleymeck: i dont understand you, gist shows that tweet.text is an array
[15:39] jeromegn: bradleymeck: Yes exactly. Actually it's pretty darn weird that the console.log returns the right thing, but then it throws me an error in that same console.log? How can that be?
[15:39] akahn has left the channel
[15:40] bradleymeck: crazygoogle shows the result of match is an array
[15:40] bradleymeck: jeromegn it dies before the 2nd log

[15:40] jeromegn: bradleymeck: there's no second log
[15:40] jeromegn: :(
[15:41] jeromegn: Does it help if I give you more of the code? it's running through a _.each loop
[15:41] bradleymeck: exactly its not dying in the console.log its dying because prior to the log being invoked and prior to match being invoked, tweet.text is set to undefined or simply not defined
[15:41] bradleymeck: it helps a lot
[15:41] CrazyGoogle: jeromegn: i tryed your code with 0.3.6 and it works without exception

[15:50] ROBOTARMY has joined the channel
[15:51] CrazyGoogle: jeromegn: if (tweet.text.match(urlRegex)) this.tweets.push(tweet); should go in to the if for hasOwnProperty

[15:53] brianc: augustl: I started toying with one last night...going to be a few weeks before it's not a heap of trash though. :)
[15:53] jeromegn: CrazyGoogle: there will always be a tweet.text property.
[15:53] softdrink has joined the channel
[15:53] CrazyGoogle: jeromegn: as i understand _.each gives you also null tweets
[15:54] killfill: ah i could use the content length.. :^P
[15:54] CrazyGoogle: jeromegn: you have to ignore null objects from .each
[15:54] jeromegn: woah
[15:54] CrazyGoogle: jeromegn: best way not to null empty tweets but delete them
[15:54] jeromegn: ok, let me try that out
[15:56] CrazyGoogle: jeromegn: best way you also can use splice
[15:56] CrazyGoogle: so you never has null values in array
[15:58] augustl: brianc: looking forward to see what people come up with
[15:58] augustl: since JavaScript is different from most other languages that have ORMs, with Object.create etc.
[15:58] bradleymeck: Object.create(null) == win
[15:59] augustl: bradleymeck: is that the same as {}?
[15:59] jeromegn: CrazyGoogle: Still getting the same issue :( that really boggles me... https://gist.github.com/64c01c709183c76e4d9a

[16:09] brianc: no worries
[16:10] jdrannbauer: brianc: Let's say I have an object that I want to reuse the same client on. How would you do that?
[16:10] CrazyGoogle: jeromegn: even if your code works it doesnt makes much sense :D You do want filter tweet based on some url in the text ? You double tweets that have it at the moment with current code.
[16:11] gflarity has joined the channel
[16:12] hwinkel has joined the channel
[16:13] brianc: jdrannbauer: reuse the same client?
[16:13] jdrannbauer: yes.
[16:13] brianc: jdrannbauer: you can create clients w/ the constructor: new Client("pg://user:password@host:port/databaseName")
[16:14] jeromegn: CrazyGoogle: Hmm, really? How so? Looping through them once, if the tweet's text matches the url I push it as an embedded object in my mongodb model, else I do nothing. How would it double it? Btw, thanks so much for your help!
[16:14] langworthy has joined the channel
[16:14] bshumate has joined the channel
[16:14] brianc: then you have a reference to the client and you can do anything you please with it
[16:14] CrazyGoogle: you looping thow whis.tweets and than do this.tweets.push(tweet)
[16:14] brianc: jdrannbauer: is this in reference to usually gaining access to clients via the callback passed to pg.connect()?
[16:15] jdrannbauer: Right. That's the part that I've figured out. I'm having difficulty using the 'drain' event with it. 
[16:15] Christopher_Bisc has joined the channel
[16:15] jdrannbauer: not using pg.connect()
[16:15] CrazyGoogle: jeromegn: isnt it simpliert to cut unneded tweets from existing array, than build new one ?
[16:15] flippyhead has joined the channel
[16:15] brianc: jdrannbauer: 'drain' fires once all the queued queries in the client have finished executing
[16:15] CrazyGoogle: jeromegn: no idea, do my new if statement worked ?
[16:15] syntheze has joined the channel
[16:15] jeromegn: CrazyGoogle: Probably :D I'll check it out! splice you said? perhaps _.filter! anyway, this.homeTimeline actually fetches it from Twitter, not from his own tweets, I know, confusing ;)
[16:15] brianc: jdrannbauer: mostly good for disconnecting the client at the end of using it, returning it to a pool, or doing something else with it. basically it is the client saying "hey, I'm sitting idle now."
[16:16] jeromegn: CrazyGoogle: yes, but there's another issue I'll be able to fix though!
[16:17] jdrannbauer: That's identified by an empty QueryQueue, right? But there are times when my client's queryqueue will be empty but I want it to hang around anyway.
[16:17] bradleymeck: does the dns module support MX record support?
[16:17] brianc: jdrannbauer: sure, you don't have to disconnect the client when drain fires

[16:18] Christopher_Bisc: torgeir:  Are you in here? I've got an eventedsocket question
[16:19] brianc: jdrannbauer: the main reason to disconnect the client is so your node process can eventually exit.  If you never disconnect the client node keeps running because the socket to postgres is still open.
[16:21] jdrannbauer: That leads me to what I think my real question is... Right, So how might I allow my object to stay connected and then disconnect when I want it to? Safely?

[16:24] lukegalea has joined the channel
[16:24] brianc: jdrannbauer: so you want to tell the client to disconnect and have it only disconnect after it's finished running it's queries. but then if the client is already finished the 'drain' event wont fire, huh?

[16:47] brianc: jdrannbauer: cool, maybe I can put an overload on the 'connection.end()' method that takes a boolean. if you pass it 'connection.end(true)' it'll wait for all active queries and or end immediately if the queue is already empty

[16:52] siculars has joined the channel
[16:52] brianc: jdrannbauer: yeah, that's cool. technically queryQueue shouldn't be on the public api of Client but is no big deal
[16:53] brianc: jdrannbauer: also would recommend if you're planning on using this on a website you work up some kind of pooling because if you create a new Base for each request you will overload the number of connections your PostgreSQL server can withstand
[16:53] jdrannbauer: Right. It would be nice to wrap that whole function into the api like suggested.
[16:53] q_no has joined the channel
[16:53] jdrannbauer: It's not for a website. At least not yet.
[16:54] brianc: jdrannbauer: and if you only use a single client instance ever it might bottlkneck the app since it will only execute 1 query at a time regardless of the number of queries issued to the client
[16:54] jdrannbauer: Oh... good point on the one at a time thing.

[17:28] booths: I'm doing something that's pretty heavy process wise, but the frequency for the requests can be 2-3 minutes between or 2-3ms between. So, I clearTimeout(timeout) and then timeout = setTimeout(..., 100); and do the actual thing in the timeout, and clear before setting. It seems to work oaky most of the time, but it seems when they're really quick, like back to back, it's not finishing the timeout ever.

[18:27] tiemonster: I compiled it myself yesterday
[18:27] jeromegn: mscdex: Yea. I'm using it on the response from Twitter... it's an array of tweets in json! should work...

[18:35] killfill: mayne missing a linker component or something..
[18:35] Bosmon2: I don't see a tag for 0.3.7... even though I see messages it was committed
[18:35] Bosmon2: killfill: To my knowledge no version since 0.3.2 has compiled on Cygwin, although I haven't tested versions later than 0.3.5

[18:37] jeromegn: mscdex: it's basically just an alias that uses getHomeTimeline from node-twitter and returns the user's home timeline
[18:37] Bosmon2: It doesn't compile
[18:37] booths: Not higher than 3.2
[18:38] Bosmon2: The last version I managed to build was v0.3.1

[18:43] killfill: hm.. http://node-js.prcn.co.cc/
[18:43] tiemonster: killfill: oh yeah - if you aren't actively developing the Windows port, I'd grab binaries
[18:44] tiemonster: I think there are more reputable binaries than that
[18:44] Bosmon2: That one worked for me too
[18:44] Bosmon2: I still get the "SConstruct" issue

[18:47] tiemonster: beat me to it
[18:47] killfill: Bosmon2: faster?
[18:48] mscdex: jeromegn: if that's the case, it's sending an actual json object, not an array
[18:48] Bosmon2: BSD has async disk IO in the kernel, which is something I believe Node can take advantage of
[18:48] mscdex: er js object rather

[19:20] ryah: shaver: oh, great
[19:20] tjholowaychuk: just like nesting in anything really
[19:20] ryah: shaver: yeah, it's okay. i wish i could fucking select text though.
[19:20] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: sass / lesscss etc, it will bite you in the ass if you nest to much
[19:20] gflarity has left the channel
[19:20] tjholowaychuk: or have to much in the same file
[19:21] hunterloftis: Well it's the markup that's nesting wrong
[19:21] hunterloftis: Two partials at the same level, are being nested with the 2nd inside the 1st
[19:21] ryah: shaver, piscisaureus: sorry for the windows support questions. how do i install console2 ?
[19:21] ryah: do i put it into program files?
[19:22] piscisaureus: use the installer :-)
[19:22] shaver: ryah: yeah
[19:22] piscisaureus: yeah, whereevery you like
[19:22] shaver: no
[19:22] shaver: the installer isn't...existing

[19:25] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: keep in mind you can always - var bar = 'foo,bar,baz'; div(foo: bar)

[19:26] shaver: piscisaureus: almost certainly -- that stuff hasn't changed in ages
[19:26] piscisaureus: sigh *hober
[19:26] piscisaureus: shaver: yeah but UAC tends to break that kind of stuff
[19:26] piscisaureus: because of registry virtualization

[19:52] shaver: piscisaureus: you can get the express edition for free
[19:52] shaver: piscisaureus: read the firefox build instructions, it points you to all the pieces

[19:52] piscisaureus: that's not the point
[19:52] piscisaureus: but it takes a day to install
[19:52] shaver: does setTimeout(func, 0) mean what I hope it means in node? (namely, "queue this in the event loop")
[19:53] shaver: yeah, express isn't too bad

[20:04] Qbix1: "Researching this issue led me to an HackerNews thread and related blog post that made me theorize the issue may be related to garbage collection, JSON.parse and the decoding of the JSON."
[20:04] ryah: that benchmark is horribly flawed

[20:05] Qbix1: I want to make sure to not do that

[20:06] mAritz: :*(
[20:06] Qbix1: are you sure that's what happened or it's your guess

[20:24] JimBastard: would that be better built with backbone + dnode instead?
[20:24] Qbix1: it makes everything symmetric
[20:25] tanepiper: it's callbacks all the way down
[20:25] Qbix1: makes you feel like there is a giant machine of nodes and browser javascript clients

[20:25] SubStack: because shipping a lib with sensible socket.io client source deps is hard :p
[20:25] pgte: anyone having trouble with npm publish?
[20:25] tanepiper: pgte: yes
[20:25] isaacs: pgte: what's the problem?
[20:25] Qbix1: SubStack: what does that mean
[20:25] JimBastard: pgte: there has been a mention of that on the mailing list, not me
[20:25] tanepiper: it's a known issue
[20:25] isaacs: it should be working now
[20:25] pgte: I get Error: unauthorized Name or password is incorrect: <package name>
[20:26] isaacs: grr...

[20:28] isaacs: pgte: can you try now?
[20:29] aaronblohowiak: chapel: what about authentication ?

[20:30] aaronblohowiak: chapel: i'd like to better understand the dnode security story, i suppose
[20:30] aaronblohowiak: Fuld: why not github?
[20:30] softdrink: anyone know if there's something like -moz-element() for webkit?
[20:30] chapel: umm, you mean like security between client and server with dnode?
[20:30] Fuld: Maybe that will be useful to someone, or you can suggest how I can make it better (I'm learning JS)
[20:31] aaronblohowiak: chapel: or like, who is the person that has this client connection
[20:31] Fuld: aaronblohowiak, github is a wonderful tool and I will be moving to it soon.
[20:31] chapel: umm the client = browser, so whoever
[20:31] aaronblohowiak: Fuld: this seems to just split on words and punctuation
[20:32] Fuld: aaronblohowiak, it's just small function yes.
[20:32] aaronblohowiak: chapel: i suppose the overall "security story" of dnode is confusing to me
[20:32] chapel: well you write functions on one side, and call them on the other
[20:33] tanepiper: SubStack is looking into auth at the moment
[20:33] piscisaureus: ryah: just reapply a61066
[20:33] chapel: can be done bi-directionally
[20:33] chapel: so it is only as secure as your code is
[20:33] Anti-X: or the code of "those"
[20:33] SubStack: aaronblohowiak: check out https://github.com/substack/dnode/tree/master/examples/auth 
[20:33] chapel: Anti-X: sure
[20:33] Fuld: aaronblohowiak: I am not happy with the opensource solutions right now, which are GATE and rapidMiner (Java)
[20:33] Anti-X: that is, if you're letting them execute things
[20:33] aaronblohowiak: Fuld: ah, cool then. you might want to test the indexOf calls against a simple regex for your canonical_penc stuff
[20:34] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: cool!
[20:34] SubStack: you can just close over the methods you want to protect and only give them up when the client delivers the magic words
[20:34] SubStack: but yeah, I'm working on a middleware for this
[20:34] piscisaureus: tiemonster: I don't know about getuid. There is no point in implementing that if there's nothing sensible at all that you can do with the result
[20:34] Anti-X: canonical_punc... variable name of the day?
[20:34] Fuld: aaronblohowiak, thank you for the feedback. Will do. :)
[20:34] tiemonster: piscisaureus: meh
[20:34] BrianTheCoder has joined the channel
[20:35] aaronblohowiak: Anti-X: it has a mohawk
[20:35] chapel: SubStack: how would you recommend doing model/collection integration in backbone with dnode?
[20:35] SubStack: oh goodness, I (or better, JimBastard) could write a dnode data replication middleware now
[20:35] Fuld: My variable names could be shorter ;p
[20:35] SubStack: because dnode 0.5 has .use()
[20:35] chapel: heh
[20:35] Anti-X: no descriptive is good
[20:35] tiemonster: piscisaureus: have something better in mind?
[20:35] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: with my experiments with Push-It, i generate a nonce and put it in a browser-readable cookie, then when the socket.io connection is made, pass that to the server. the server then ties the socket.io cid to the express session
[20:36] techwraith: Fuld: Definitely keep things descriptive :) (though I would take out those underscores and camel case 'em - then again, that's personal preference...)
[20:36] Fuld: In the future, I think programming language variables will be semantic. They'll have a short name, and a description that pops up in vim.
[20:36] Anti-X: Fuld, speaking of indexOf.. use !~indexOf() to test for no match
[20:36] Fuld: techwraith, yup
[20:37] piscisaureus: tiemonster: make the nonproficient ppl do the env stuf.. That's really a no-brainer.
[20:37] piscisaureus: The good guys should do something more challenging, like fixing getAddrInfo 
[20:37] piscisaureus: still too easy I'd say :-)
[20:37] Anti-X: ACTION is preaching squiggleoperatorism
[20:38] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: this gets around the question of "how does the socket.io transport become aware of user auth without exposing a huge XSS vulnerability"
[20:38] tiemonster: piscisaureus: I'll look into it
[20:38] SubStack: aaronblohowiak: in socket.io you can get at the middlewarified request object using some tricks
[20:38] piscisaureus: ok.
[20:38] piscisaureus: well, whatever
[20:38] tiemonster: maybe we'll do getuid and see how much time we have left
[20:38] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: does that support all transports?
[20:38] piscisaureus: yeah thats okay
[20:38] SubStack: aaronblohowiak: not sure, but it seems to work in websockets and xhr multipart at least
[20:38] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: i've tried using bnoguchi's socket.io-connect, but it had a couple hang-ups
[20:39] Anti-X: Fuld, sorry... in your case it's ~indexOf for match.. not !~ for no match
[20:39] Anti-X: i misread the code for a sec
[20:39] piscisaureus: tiemonster: but if your teacher wants you to actually land something maybe its better to do something else
[20:39] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: do you have a good link for those tricks?
[20:39] Fuld: Anti-X, np. :)
[20:39] tiemonster: piscisaureus: if the env guys finish early, we'll go from there
[20:39] Fuld: Okay so now I need to get libaspell working in node.js

[20:39] piscisaureus: ok
[20:40] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: ah, so you're just getting the raw socketio.request
[20:40] tanepiper: aaronblohowiak: any of the push-it code with auth open source?
[20:40] pgte: isaacs: publish got through, thanks

[20:41] mnbvasd: piscisaureus: how about 9:39pm?
[20:41] Fuld: How would one go about using a C library from node.js? Write a C extension with v8.h and node.h?
[20:41] tanepiper: aaronblohowiak: that would be cool, auth is something i really need to bolt up
[20:41] Fuld: A libaspell module for node.js would rock

[20:47] SubStack: this module is generic enough for you to bring your own arguments
[20:48] mnbvasd: cool.. you should implement all the common auth mechs then :D
[20:48] aaronblohowiak: mAritz: ah.  i wrote some code which will go through a directory, run all the *.haml files through Haml() to get the function source and then put this in a single javascript file to a) pre-compile templates for the browser and b) make it so that templates have the same path
[20:49] tjholowaychuk: mAritz: if you did that you could use jade i'd think
[20:49] mAritz: aaronblohowiak: not a bad idea. :)
[20:49] tjholowaychuk: anything really
[20:49] mAritz: does jade pre-compile into js functions that are browser-usable?

[21:14] bingomanatee: I'm pretty comfortable with express to date - and a little less so with mongo-native - but I think there is a missing metamodel of component driven code that would make node a little more adaptible.

[21:15] edw: bingomanatee: 1) It's often smart to acquire code debt. You need to use judgement. 2) If you're trying to learn something, simply re-typing what you see on a page is a hell of a lot more effective than copy and paste. 3.) To equate copy and paste coding with building atop the abstractions of others is bold, boldly wrong.
[21:15] bingomanatee: Well, and please I know there are a lot of mockable points to what I'm about to say but, Drupal has given peope tools to do a fantastic amount of work by creating modules with an API that interrelates said modules in a working fashion.

[21:16] miccolis: bingomanatee: it's hard to hold back the mocking...
[21:16] bingomanatee: Node's modules interoperate at the code level - I would like to see a higher level of compoent based design where a certain amount of assumed standards allow for a wealth of RAD sites that retain the strengths of node's performance while allowing for a richer community driven development rrain.

[21:17] Lorentz: Just gonna go at it with straight-up native mongodb.
[21:17] bingomanatee: I realize full well Drupal has a dark side - a community built on ingnorance and a codebase that is just simply painful. 
[21:17] mnbvasd: flukes1: look for the real socket attached to the secure one.
[21:17] bingomanatee: But the fact is its been a commercial success because it has answered the needs of developers AND their downstream clients. 
[21:18] mnbvasd: bingomanatee: then look for the ip on that.

[21:18] flukes1: mnbvasd: ok thanks
[21:18] bingomanatee: And Ruby does to some extent - it forces you to program which is a good thing and has component models in the gem system which is also a good thing. 
[21:18] pr2012: why do these things always have to be on the west coast.
[21:19] bingomanatee: What I am saying is that if node doesn't exist at a healthy point on the ease of deployment, ease of use, and wealth of customer centric feature scale than its not going to persist. 
[21:19] mandric has joined the channel
[21:19] pr2012: Its not that hard to deploy
[21:20] edw: bingomanatee: Drupal all but forces its developers into acquiring an unsupportable level of code debt. And it's so easy to do. And your typical Drupal developer (graphic designer who thinks HTML is programming) is in no place to understand how grave their situation is.
[21:20] Bosmon2: It will persist...
[21:20] Bosmon2: It answers a need that nothing else meets
[21:20] edw: Bosmon2: I don't disagree.
[21:21] zzak: apples and oranges
[21:21] Bosmon2: All of those other extrinsic values will come, in time
[21:21] bingomanatee: Oh yeah - Drupal lets you dig yourself into a hole big time.

[21:21] Me1000 has joined the channel
[21:21] bingomanatee: I'm not saying Drupal does everything right - I am pointing to the one thing that it does do right and saying, that is a thing that other apps would do well to emulate. 
[21:22] Lorentz: I don't care about drupal in and of itself, but it would be good to see a nodejs version.
[21:22] Lorentz: Possibly leveraging npm for having modules available.
[21:22] bingomanatee: I am not completely convinced that we need more swiss-army knives - I think a series of specialist apps built on a shared higher level series of libraries would be fine. 
[21:22] zzak: lorentz: there is a node cms
[21:22] Bosmon2: Organic growth of a library and community is the only way to achieve those things
[21:23] Bosmon2: It's no good setting out by saying "we need all these customer-centric features or else we will fail" :P
[21:23] mnbvasd: node just needs some good apps.
[21:23] bingomanatee: I think its defensible to say that node needs customers or it will fail. 
[21:23] Lorentz: zzak: There is?
[21:23] nooder has joined the channel
[21:23] zzak: https://github.com/robrighter/node-cms
[21:24] edw: I think a Drupal-atop-Nodejs would suck as badly as Drupal-atop-PHP. My take on it is that nontrivial Drupal projects are trying to do things that are more complex than your typical Drupal "author" is capable of understanding, and it therefore results in an unsupportable pile of hundreds of modules.
[21:24] bingomanatee: I'm not saying which set of customer centric features it needs, though I think its fair to say that it needs SOME. 
[21:24] Lorentz: zzak: Looks pretty early in the works
[21:24] zzak: there might be others, just look around
[21:24] bingomanatee: And Drupal and RoR have succeeded because they have customer centric features. 
[21:24] tanepiper: bingomanatee: agreed, i think what node does need is a bunch of high level libraries with well written API's.
[21:24] tanepiper: I mean express already does a pretty good job of being a routing + view engine
[21:24] edw: There are three sorts of CMS-like projects: 1) projects that are simple enough for WordPress, 2) projects that are simple enough for Drupal, and 3) projects that you should use Django or Rails or whatever for.
[21:24] Bosmon2: Well, node "in itself" isn't going to solve the problem of composition of libraries any more than any other environment did
[21:25] bingomanatee: So if you don't like the customer centric features of Drupal and you don't like the customer centric features of RoR, then you better find some customer centric features to like. 
[21:25] Bosmon2: That is a problem for our entire community :P
[21:25] tanepiper: and i like it doesn't make assumptions about the database you want to use

[21:27] SubStack: this one will be a little bit different for sure
[21:27] tjholowaychuk: id like to all the cookie stuff controllable at the session level etc
[21:27] AAA_awright: edw: I think I've found the "correct" model for working with data where the same framework could power a very simple blog, or a complex site with lots of different content types, or a massively complex data analysis project
[21:27] tanepiper: if Connect + Dnode work together even nicer, that would be awesome guys :)

[21:28] SubStack: where everybody gets a session no matter what
[21:29] SubStack: and you can just req.session.whatever = 555
[21:29] tjholowaychuk: connect's should always give you a session
[21:29] SubStack: even if you use a persistent store
[21:29] tjholowaychuk: unless its broken
[21:29] tjholowaychuk: lol

[21:29] tjholowaychuk: fuck

[21:30] bingomanatee: For instance if your project is a fairly straightforward app with users, blog pages, and a simple layout, I think you have a right to expect a framework to be able to give you a decent scaffolding app with a simple configuration file. 
[21:30] AAA_awright: zzak: Is that your project?
[21:30] zzak: negative
[21:30] SubStack: I hate scaffolding. :/
[21:30] SubStack: code generation!
[21:30] SubStack: makes me queasy
[21:31] edw: AAA_awright: It's about finding the right level of abstraction. I've seen people do things like use ontology systems eg Protege to model problems that should be solved with RDBMSes, and then use an RDBMS as the backing store for the Protege model. They just could have used Erwin for God's sake. Similarly, I have seen people doing stuff in Drupal that would take three lines of Python code using Django but take hours with Drupal.
[21:31] pr2012: its good for prototyping
[21:31] tjholowaychuk: SubStack: I'll see if i can fix that in a few days if i have time
[21:31] SubStack: scaffolding shouldn't be necessary in a language with lambdas
[21:31] tjholowaychuk: probably something really dumb
[21:31] SubStack: tjholowaychuk: awesome
[21:31] bingomanatee: I'm not saying every project should be like that - but to me that is a basic benchmark of a mature framework. 
[21:32] bingomanatee: You should be able to assemble a working prototype then deviate and optimize where deviation and optimization are appropriate. 
[21:32] AAA_awright: edw: No system is the fastest for any given project, but in terms of the data model I'm using RDF to represent data, in such a way you can manipulate it in a great number of ways
[21:32] Lorentz: Is there a standard document for coding standard for packages going up into npm?
[21:32] Lorentz: Or is it free for all as it is?
[21:32] SubStack: bingomanatee: I definitely prefer incrementalism over scaffolding
[21:33] montylounge has joined the channel
[21:33] edw: AAA_awright: And RDF makes sense for a subset of problems. But to then think it's the Universal Solution to All Problems is misguided.
[21:33] SubStack: of course, I'm not writing boring crud apps
[21:33] adambeynon has joined the channel
[21:34] edw: AAA_awright: Similarly, to not see that eg Drupal is much easier to use than RoR if you're just putting together a blog++ is stupid.
[21:34] SubStack: but most business apps are just a boring database frontend :/
[21:35] SubStack: the middleware approach is much more composable than scaffolds, so it's easier to tie in a bunch of disparate libs
[21:35] SubStack: but then it requires a bit more research to figure out which middlewares your app will need
[21:35] edw: I flip the bozo bit on people when they start to think of every web site as a CMS (as in the example of Drupal), because, duh, yeah you CAN think of everything as a CMS (nail) waiting to be built (hit) with Drupal (hammer), but it's not smart.

[21:36] pgte has left the channel
[21:37] ryah: getaddrinfo works in windows out of the bo
[21:37] Lorentz: So there's no coding standard for all packages going up on npm?
[21:38] Lorentz: Other than that it works.
[21:38] ossareh_ has joined the channel

[21:38] AAA_awright: edw: There's things that a CMS wouldn't be useful but with what I'm thinking of there's not much it wouldn't be useful for
[21:38] SubStack: if a package works, it doesn't matter how it's coded
[21:38] Lorentz: isaacs: Coding standard, not about package.json.
[21:38] isaacs: Lorentz: it's considered Good Form to describe your package in that document as accurately as possible, provide docs, a "main" module, a test script, etc.
[21:39] isaacs: Lorentz: there are some emerging conventions.
[21:39] isaacs: but nothing like the FHS or anything
[21:39] Lorentz: Righto then
[21:39] isaacs: I guess the main thing is, don't do stuff like "make install" into /usr/local/bin when you can just "make" and then tell npm to put it where it goes.

[21:41] isaacs: SubStack: well put.
[21:41] aaronblohowiak: isaacs: the answer to my question yesterday about using package.json to track deps without worrying about accidentally deploying the closed-source code has a trivial solution: put it in a subfolder in the application source
[21:41] SubStack: by which I mean, json is not turing computable
[21:41] tjholowaychuk: SubStack: just so i know when im checking out the session thing, was there anything specific causing the issue? or just seemed at random?
[21:41] isaacs: aaronblohowiak: how do you mean?
[21:41] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: neither are folder structures
[21:41] edw: AAA_awright: Then I think you're barking up the wrong tree. Because you're going to need to introduce so much flexibility that there's little value in the abstractions you're producing. "Specifically targeted at...everybody and everything" makes no sense.
[21:41] isaacs: aaronblohowiak: oh, you mean, you have project/packagedeps/package.json?
[21:41] aaronblohowiak: isaacs: APPLICATION_ROOT/package/package.json
[21:42] aaronblohowiak: yea
[21:42] isaacs: and then npm install ./package instead of npm install .
[21:42] aaronblohowiak: yup!!!
[21:42] isaacs: you could still do `npm publish ./package`, but then it'd not include your stuff.  very clever!
[21:42] aaronblohowiak: or maybe ./dependencies or so, which would then also lend itself for bundler-esque things
[21:42] SubStack: I don't like too many directories at first
[21:42] isaacs: you could even (cd package ; npm bundle), and then require("./package/node_modules/foo")
[21:43] SubStack: actually, I don't like too many directories at all
[21:43] aaronblohowiak: isaacs: that, i'd have to experiment with
[21:43] AAA_awright: edw: Put it this way It's a matter of making it modular enough to build up the system as high as you need it and no higher. Drupal comes with a notion of "users" and generates HTML, but no notion of data types or HTTP or other data protocols like IMAP
[21:43] isaacs: aaronblohowiak: re: generating a package.json, that's what `npm init` does.  i don't use it personally, but i'm happy to accept patches if you want to make it fancier.
[21:43] AAA_awright: So if you want it, it goes in the wrong direction for many things, likely
[21:43] aaronblohowiak: isaacs: npm init does exactly what i want it to

No drag-and-drool programming system has ever succeeded, in large part because of this problem.
[21:47] bingomanatee: Node doesn't rely on Apache which is an immediate reason for best practices developers to question it.

[21:49] AAA_awright: edw: My idea is provide enough car for a flying tank with flamethrowers that can travel 1000mi/hr, but modular enough you can buy just a working chassis and engine, say

[21:49] Bosmon2: It just needs to be sustaintable
[21:49] Bosmon2: Which IMO it is already

[21:52] isaacs: bingomanatee: unless you want to actually use it :)
[21:52] Bosmon2: No point worrying about it, let's just get on with making node better :P
[21:52] bingomanatee: you ask: "Can I drive it through a wall? Can it kill anything in front of it?"
[21:52] Lorentz: A retailer I worked for used to push a million dollars in sales a day, minimum.
[21:52] pr2012: Really AWS has been awful for us. No one worries about code performance anymore. Just throw more servers at it. Which of course rarely works out.
[21:52] tanepiper: ^5 Bosmon2 
[21:52] Lorentz: That's a lot of money lost if even one minute is down.
[21:52] Lorentz: And really bad downtimes rarely are just only one minute long.
[21:53] tanepiper: A) Lets get SSL fixed B) Lets make debugging better c) Lets get some higher level frameworks to make approaching common problems easier

[21:53] bingomanatee: I used to work in Currenex. They trade currency in the units of millions of dollars. Let me repeat: EVERY transaction on Currenex is a trade of millions of Dollars (or other currency units.)
[21:53] isaacs: bingomanatee: i get what your'e saying, but your analogy is flawed.
[21:53] tanepiper: and by frameworks i really mean libraries
[21:53] Lorentz: SSL definitely needs to work flawlessly.
[21:53] bingomanatee: Anyone care to write a proposal for wny Currenex should be using Node?
[21:53] isaacs: bingomanatee: when it comes to tanks, getting there on time is worth a lot
[21:54] Lorentz: I can't imagine businesses doing business without ssl.
[21:54] bingomanatee: Thats why you get planes to drop your tanks out of :D
[21:54] Lorentz: In fact, I probably can't deploy business sites in korea, it's illegal to not have ssl on transactions.
[21:54] bingomanatee: Big fucking planes. 
[21:54] lukegalea: Hey, is anyone using master(1.0) of Mongoose?

[21:55] pr2012: I use slicehost on my own projects, but it hasn't been much better
[21:55] isaacs: bingomanatee: right, so, the point is, *knowing* your resource usage and limitations is half the battle.  the other half is showing up and killing a substantial number of your enemies forces, or convincing their leadership to back down in some other fashion.
[21:55] vilsonvieira has joined the channel
[21:55] bingomanatee: By the way Currenex DID have down time problems :D
[21:55] tanepiper: aaronblohowiak: easier to use, maybe it just needs better docs
[21:56] bingomanatee: I'm not tring to make an absolute argument: I'm here - obviously I like node, and where it is going. 
[21:56] aaronblohowiak: tanepiper: have you seen the youtube videos?
[21:56] tanepiper: aaronblohowiak: no
[21:56] flukes1: What would be the best way in node to avoid processing socket data until I have n bytes
[21:56] bingomanatee: I just think that you have to respect the world as it is and realize that reasonable people are going to look at node and often make reasonable and defensible decisions not to use it 
[21:57] bingomanatee: until node has established itself on par with some very intrenched and mature players .
[21:57] tanepiper: flukes1: pipe into a buffer and check the lenght, then when you have the amount of bytes pass it to another event?
[21:57] lukegalea: tjholowaychuk: Are you involved in maintaining mongoose at all? Can I bug you? Or should I wait until Guillermo is around? 
[21:57] aaronblohowiak: bingomanatee: yes, node is not going to replace all programming environments.
[21:57] tjholowaychuk: lukegalea: i was involved, not anymore tho, working on other stuff
[21:58] tjholowaychuk: lukegalea: Guillermo has been rewritting it
[21:58] lukegalea: Thanks anyway :) I'm using his rewrite.
[21:58] lukegalea: Or rather, I am *trying* to use his rewrite.
[21:58] tjholowaychuk: :)
[21:58] bingomanatee: I'm trying to establish - being flip about the other frameworks that have succeeded blinds you to the lessons you can take away from their success. 
[21:58] lukegalea: It's perhaps not fully rewritten yet. 
[21:58] aaronblohowiak: lukegalea: Monday, that will be easier
[21:59] aaronblohowiak: bingomanatee: i would not say that drupal has succeeded in any way that I care about
[21:59] lukegalea: aaronblohowiak: hehe. Sure. Well at the very least I can help test it. I can feed some issues into github if it's not just going to be: "ya ya, we know it doesn't work"
[21:59] bingomanatee: You can choose your market and vector but you are not going to be able to invent a marketplace for applications that doesn't have a player - know and respect them.
[21:59] tanepiper: aaronblohowiak: cool found the videos, i'll run through it tomorrow
[21:59] aaronblohowiak: lukegalea: ah, okay
[21:59] bingomanatee: aaronblohowiak: then you must never have heard of a job board or talked to a recruiter.

[22:00] tanepiper: bingomanatee: talk to micheil
[22:01] bingomanatee: I will - think he is coming to my node meet. 
[22:01] JohnnyL: http://pastie.org/1507174  does anyone here know why I get that error. I'm new to node.js
[22:02] shaver: aaronblohowiak: modelling of desired behaviour
[22:02] aaronblohowiak: JohnnyL: you close the response, not the request.. the client closes the request
[22:03] aaronblohowiak: shaver: i wish that were enough, and it can be if the community grows slowly enough
[22:03] JohnnyL: aaronblohowiak: thanks, it's sample code of the net.
[22:03] shaver: it's worked for me
[22:03] aaronblohowiak: JohnnyL: link to that?
[22:04] JohnnyL: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/learning-serverside-javascript-with-node-js/
[22:04] bingomanatee: pr2012: you can do both :D
[22:04] aaronblohowiak: JohnnyL: ooooh, i didnt read that well.  whoops i thought it was an httpServer clientRequest
[22:05] aaronblohowiak: JohnnyL: that is based on an old version of node =/  you want to change close() to end()

[22:11] flukes1: I mean, it reads the maximum amount possible and automatically allocates memory to store it, right?

[22:12] mikeal has joined the channel
[22:12] aaronblohowiak: flukes1: that is what pause() does, it will stop sending tcp ack's
[22:12] flukes1: hm, okay
[22:12] flukes1: thanks
[22:13] aaronblohowiak: flukes1: the operating system itself has a fixed-size buffer for network traffic, when that buffer starts to get too full it basically won't accept any more
[22:13] tim_smart: flukes1: 'data' event emits a network chunk.
[22:13] flukes1: yeah, makes sense, sorry was just being slightly dim
[22:13] aaronblohowiak: flukes1: you run into trouble in lesser libraries that just keep on consuming the os buffer no matter what your application does
[22:13] tim_smart: Which is around 80kb or something.
[22:13] mjr_ has joined the channel
[22:14] aaronblohowiak: flukes1: no worries, node is the lowest-level high-level i/o lib

[22:15] flukes1: not particularly ;p

[22:20] isaacs: felixge: and the src/node.js refactor.
[22:20] felixge: isaacs: thanks :)
[22:20] bingomanatee: isaacs: not ignoring your point by the way - 
[22:20] Fuld: What should I call my node.js extension that adds the spell checking library that Openoffice and Chrome use to node.js?
[22:21] felixge: isaacs: well, I actually decided I'll not use the cache for injecting test doubles
[22:21] Fuld: It's libhunspell. Maybe call it nodehazspell :p
[22:21] felixge: isaacs: Instead I'll execute my test code in a sandbox
[22:21] isaacs: felixge: that's one way to do it
[22:21] felixge: isaacs: much more flexible, and it will also allow me to easily test client-side code
[22:21] ossareh_ has joined the channel
[22:21] isaacs: felixge: you can even give it a require function
[22:21] isaacs: that does different stuff

[22:23] felixge: tanepiper: I'm pretty close to working code now, so maybe already this weekend
[22:24] tanepiper: felixge: cool, i need to implement some proper tests over asserts
[22:24] fission6: whats the advatage of using sys.puts vs console.log
[22:24] tanepiper: assert is fine for basic stuff
[22:24] tilgovi has joined the channel
[22:24] tanepiper: fission6: console is global, sys needs import
[22:25] fission6: is one better than another
[22:25] felixge: tanepiper: this effort is orthogonal to the assert module
[22:25] mraleph: piscisaureus: great. I just greped the log for my name and found that you had some problems with windows...
[22:25] felixge: tanepiper: but maybe I'll ship an enhanced assert library with it, not sure :)
[22:26] tanepiper: fission6: console.log is fine, and you can use it with util.inspect as well
[22:26] tanepiper: and do string replacement
[22:26] fission6: ok cool
[22:26] perlmonkey2 has joined the channel
[22:26] tanepiper: like console.log("result %j", jsonObject);  console.log("value %d", value)

[22:27] mraleph: *sigh*
[22:28] tanepiper: but anything that helps with testing will be good
[22:28] felixge: tanepiper: are you coming to nodeconf?
[22:28] slickplaid: when you're dealing with callbacks in functions... is it std practice to include 'return true/false;' after the callback is given depending on if it was successful or not (even if you're giving the callback errors,results?
[22:28] tanepiper: felixge: nahh, can't afford it
[22:28] tanepiper: slickplaid: i only do if i return an error at some point
[22:29] tanepiper: like
[22:29] tanepiper: if (error) { cb(error); return } // code continues here
[22:29] slickplaid: yeah okay
[22:29] slickplaid: but you don't on a positive result?
[22:29] SubStack: slickplaid: you very rarely know by the time the function returns whether an error happened if that's what you mean
[22:30] perlmonkey2 has joined the channel
[22:30] slickplaid: i'm using return false; after the error callback to stop the function from continuing

[23:05] slickplaid: I am extremely interested in finding something for that or at least some place to point me in the right direction
[23:05] tjholowaychuk: the express repo has a session example
[23:05] tjholowaychuk: but its nothing amazing
[23:05] tjholowaychuk:  i need some larger examples
[23:05] slickplaid: Is there code/information on what you're working on SubStack?
[23:05] piscisaureus: ryah: getaddrinfo might work but you need to be aware of unicode issues
[23:05] slickplaid: Yeah, I'm looking at that now tjholowaychuk :)
[23:05] Ond: I'd like that, tjholowachuk 
[23:05] Ond: Love examples
[23:06] elbod has joined the channel
[23:06] SubStack: slickplaid: nah, probably a few more hours to go
[23:06] Ond: And the express examples are more thorough than any other module I've played with :thumbsup:
[23:06] tjholowaychuk: :)
[23:06] tjholowaychuk: its hard to keep them focused
[23:06] tjholowaychuk: but ill take the auth one and add sessions to it for a larger example
[23:06] elbod has left the channel
[23:06] JohnnyL: found a bug. The program worked the first time is ran. Now I get: http://pastie.org/1507483 Aparently the ctrl-c to stop the server left it in a funny state (or more likely found a deprecrated object-function in a conditional path).
[23:07] slickplaid: SubStack, just ping you later tonight or is there somewhere I could be looking for updates for it? :D
[23:07] SubStack: slickplaid: sure, or just follow me on github and you'll see it in your timeline
[23:07] SubStack: tjholowaychuk: consider wrapping the http.ServerRequest so it's actually useful for a change :p
[23:08] slickplaid: Okay, thanks... username is substack?
[23:08] sechrist has joined the channel
[23:08] SubStack: tjholowaychuk: like this https://github.com/substack/node-resware 
[23:08] SubStack: slickplaid: yep
[23:08] tjholowaychuk: SubStack: for what?
[23:08] slickplaid: Done and done.
[23:09] SubStack: tjholowaychuk: so middleware can do stuff like set cookies cleanly
[23:09] ossareh_ has joined the channel
[23:09] SubStack: if that is already possible then it's not obvious without wrapping around the response object
[23:09] tjholowaychuk: SubStack: i'd like to keep that stuff at the express level (mostly)
[23:09] tjholowaychuk: it's easy..
[23:09] tjholowaychuk: we do it in lots of connect modules
[23:09] tjholowaychuk: in fact most of them
[23:10] SubStack: how?
[23:10] tjholowaychuk: replacing the method and calling the old one within it
[23:10] mdoan has joined the channel
[23:11] SubStack: aha, I see res.cookie() neat
[23:12] tanepiper: hmm, sounds like i'll need to plug express into my app then, i'm just using connect just now
[23:12] tjholowaychuk: SubStack: https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/master/lib/connect/middleware/logger.js#L102-113
[23:12] tjholowaychuk: is that what you mean?
[23:12] tjholowaychuk: we proxy like that all over
[23:12] tjholowaychuk: tanepiper: why?
[23:12] tanepiper: < tjholowaychuk> SubStack: i'd like to keep that stuff at the express level (mostly)
[23:12] tjholowaychuk: oh
[23:12] tjholowaychuk: yes
[23:12] tjholowaychuk: higher level stuff will stay in express
[23:13] bingomanatee: tjholowaychuk: do you ever get "Stream is not writable" in mongodb?
[23:13] brianmario has joined the channel
[23:13] tjholowaychuk: bingomanatee: nope
[23:13] SubStack: it seems a bit clunky for every module to implement that stuff itself
[23:13] bingomanatee: hm. 
[23:14] tjholowaychuk: SubStack:  you could say that about anything
[23:14] dmcquay has joined the channel
[23:14] tjholowaychuk: cookies are possibly the one exception
[23:14] SubStack: in the sense specifically of duplicated functionality
[23:15] SubStack: although it seems stable in practice with multiple middlewares patching the same objects
[23:15] iFire has joined the channel
[23:15] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[23:15] tjholowaychuk: i wouldnt want it on the response, maybe a util or something
[23:15] Fuld: How do you compile a node.js C++ extension with gcc?
[23:15] benburkert has joined the channel
[23:15] Fuld: Do I make this an object for node.js to load?
[23:16] SubStack: the real problem is that http should have setHeader()
[23:16] SubStack: that would negate all of this
[23:16] Fuld: ACTION is trying to make a boilerplate for libhunspell for node.js
[23:17] tjholowaychuk: SubStack: yeah I do all that stuff at the express level right now, that and a cookie util would be ok in connect
[23:17] tjholowaychuk: i just have res.headers buffer up until res.send()
[23:17] tjholowaychuk: or res.writeHead(200, res.headers) etc
[23:17] tjholowaychuk: but if node would handle that it would be way nicer

[23:21] Fuld: Anyone know how to fix this? Checking for node path                   : not found
[23:21] tanepiper: tjholowaychuk: is it something that could be put in pre-0.4 with the new http stuff or would it break too much?
[23:21] Fuld: How do you tell node-waf the node path? Is that the node source code?
[23:22] tanepiper: ACTION really needs to take a weekend to dive into node internals
[23:22] mscdex: Fuld: where is that from?
[23:22] tjholowaychuk: tanepiper: should be able to change connect's http.Server inheritance to use https.Server and then do connect.createServer(...).setOptions(....).listen()
[23:22] Fuld: mscdex, I'm making a node module for spelling and I'm new to this :)
[23:23] mscdex: what do you need the node path for?
[23:23] Fuld: Here's more detail: http://codepad.org/AMJLBJdN
[23:24] Fuld: Hopefully that will give you an idea of what I'm trying to accomplish :)

[23:26] tjholowaychuk: but i thought it was generally accepted
[23:26] Fuld: http://codepad.org/AMJLBJdN Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?

[23:27] ezmobius: and i live in portland
[23:27] ezmobius: maybe ill just come lurk
[23:27] tanepiper: tjholowaychuk: https://groups.google.com/d/topic/nodejs-dev/06rzrC5JBo4/discussion ?
[23:28] tjholowaychuk: yeah i think that would be the one
[23:28] moneal: ezmobius: general is sold out?
[23:28] podman1 has joined the channel
[23:29] ezmobius: sold out in 2 minutes aparently
[23:29] moneal: Node conf should sell virtual tickets. Allow you to stream the talks or something
[23:29] ezmobius: people must have had botgs ready to buy tickets or something
[23:29] mscdex: they streamed it last time
[23:29] ezmobius: bots*
[23:29] ryah: mikeal: how many earlybird tickets were there?
[23:30] Fuld: I don't have node_libraries anywhere on my machine. Where can you grab them?
[23:30] mikeal: i don't remember 
[23:30] mikeal: we sold over a hundred total
[23:30] curtischambers has joined the channel
[23:30] mscdex: Fuld: it's just a user-created directory
[23:30] mscdex: but it shouldn't matter if you have it or not
[23:31] flukes1: if you call stream.pipe() will subsequent 'data' events continue to be emitted
[23:31] moneal: I dig that portland is getting more conferences.
[23:31] tanepiper: tjholowaychuk: infact reading it yea i think it's talking about the exact same thing as SubStack is
[23:31] Fuld: Checking for node path                   : not found is a fatal error isn't it?
[23:31] tanepiper: "Different middlewares may need to set different cookies and these middleware(s) may have no knowledge of each other (since they have no need to from a modularity / separation-of-concerns standpoint). An immutable 'Set-Cookie' header would prevent this scenario."
[23:31] mscdex: Fuld: evidentally not
[23:32] Fuld: This is in red: Cannot guess how to process src:///opt/prodigylink/open/nodejs_spell/hunspell.c (got mappings ['.C', '.cc', '.cpp', '.c++', '.cxx'] in <class 'cxx.cxx_taskgen'>) -> try conf.check_tool(..)?

[23:53] keks: Rixius: crypto was espacially nice because it used openssl, which made it really fast. if you implement all this in js, i guess you'll have to wait. a lot.
[23:53] yozgrahame: followed by another one on doing better OO in JS
[23:53] Fuld: mscdex, do you mean hunspell.cc?

[23:53] Rixius: anyone else building on top of Openssl?
[23:53] yozgrahame: SubStack: sorry, just lining up the joke
[23:53] shaver: so for client-initiated stuff it seems like HTTP is better than socket.io's flashsocket transport
[23:54] shaver: that's unexpected
[23:54] SubStack: ah right
[23:54] keks: Rixius: I don't think so, since using c(++)-libs is a pretty new to do in js...

[23:58] Rixius: So it is stable to build on in 0.2.6? and can be translated into the npm dependencie when that happens?
[23:58] Rixius: AFAIK I'm only encrypting/decrypting things in memory
