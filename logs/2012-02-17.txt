[00:00] isaacs: tarkus: not for the command line, no, there isn't
[00:01] isaacs: tarkus: you have to cd to where the actual file is to run it
[00:01] isaacs: tarkus: same as php, ruby, python, etc.

[00:02] bnoordhuis: `3rdEden: the conversion is pretty slow
[00:02] `3rdEden: Good to know :)
[00:02] bnoordhuis: but if your data is a string to start with it won't matter
[00:02] dunder-mifflin: can octets only be represented in 0xNN format or it's the same thing if i pass a number? this is re node.js' new Buffer(array-of-octets)
[00:03] isaacs: tarkus: that's because that folder is in your PATH
[00:03] `3rdEden: bnoordhuis iknow but when you write big chunks of data, 100kb+ You don't really want to have that in V8's heap
[00:03] isaacs: tarkus: but node doesnt' look at the PATH to find command line arguments.
[00:03] isaacs: tarkus: it just does path.resolve() on them
[00:03] bnoordhuis: dunder-mifflin: you can do `new Buffer([32, 64, 255, 0])`
[00:03] Bonuspunkt: tarkus you could make a module place in the package.js some entries at bin and install the module with -g

[00:35] isaacs: tarkus: however, it looks like requirejs is doing some weird stuff.
[00:35] isaacs: tarkus: npm sets up a .cmd batch file for packages, and puts those in the PATH for global installs.
[00:35] bnoordhuis: dunder-mifflin: there's node-profiler and node-inspector
[00:35] isaacs: tarkus: but something about requirejs's is confusing windows.  not sure why

[01:23] chrisinajar: either way, what i needed was an api to kill it

[04:56] airandfingers: is a reverse proxy server a better long-term solution than hosting public apps with node on port 80?
[04:57] airandfingers: hm okay, i'll look into reverse proxy servers
[04:57] EhevuTov: airandfingers, I think there's an apache module for web sockets, but maybe not for reverse proxy
[04:57] porco has joined the channel
[04:57] Draggor: airandfingers: it's more about being flexible for using non node things.
[04:57] Planet_EN: is it better to use nginx for forwarding and routing from a performance perspective?
[04:57] Draggor: reverse proxy is built in to apache
[04:57] Draggor: I can dig up a config, I haven't enabled it in a while
[04:58] airandfingers: hm, so maybe not something i need now, since i'm not intent on using apache for some things
[04:58] airandfingers: but in the future, a logical step to take if i want to host with both node and some other server

[04:59] airandfingers: (sudo on those others too)
[04:59] EhevuTov: that's a lot
[05:00] airandfingers: last command might be overkill?
[05:00] airandfingers: it's a VPS from dreamhost so i didn't want apache coming back if they decide to upgrade my server

[12:58] benvie: I had a single central emitter and had an initializer for components that plugged onto it. That prototype for a subcomponent had an emit event that added that submodules name to the event name and emitted it out of the central emitter
[12:58] devaholic has joined the channel
[12:58] benvie: so each one would do like this.emit('whatever') and it'd come out of the center as 'submodule.whatever'
[12:59] shariffy: ah I see
[12:59] benvie: and you could list for 'submodule.*' or 'whatever' and it'd hit listeners for both

[13:00] wink_ has joined the channel

[13:10] diegoviola: as root i can run fine on port 80
[13:10] diegoviola: it seems like a permission issue
[13:11] Sly__: diegoviola, anything under port 1024 on *NIX requires elevated privileges.
[13:11] benvie: you can't return a value determined ascynchronously
[13:11] diegoviola: Sly__: ok ty
[13:11] TimTimTim: it seems like it would be inefficient to set an interval or a while loop or something to wait until the value is ready
[13:12] benvie: it won't be executed until at least another turn of the event loop which requires the call stack to be cleared and execution completed

[13:22] AndreasMadsen: Sly__: hi
[13:22] Sly__: diegoviola, you need to spawn a child process with the "setsid" option set to "true".
[13:22] diegoviola: Sly__: thanks
[13:22] diegoviola: cool
[13:22] Sly__: diegoviola, this will cause it to spawn a child process in a new session separate from the parent.
[13:23] Sly__: diegoviola, then you can kill the parent and the child will still run.
[13:23] diegoviola: Sly__: ty
[13:23] Sly__: diegoviola, thank AndreasMadsen. He's the one that tipped me off. I usually just use `node script.js &`.

[13:59] thinkjson: Glenjamin: so you have some kind of timer or something holding up the loop?
[13:59] jamund has joined the channel
[13:59] thinkjson: pleaz: depends on what you're doing. if you `npm install [package]` in the directory where the script is, you can just do `require ('[package]');`
[14:00] Glenjamin: thinkjson: i'm not sure, while it was running it had an http server, 2 queue server connections, a bunch of http requests and some setTimeouts
[14:00] Glenjamin: and some open log files
[14:00] r04r has joined the channel
[14:00] Glenjamin: i'm trying to make it shut down without using process.exit
[14:00] thinkjson: Glenjamin: I would start with debugging the setTimeouts
[14:00] thinkjson: understood
[14:00] Glenjamin: so i added a clearTimeout as part of my shutdown() call
[14:00] Glenjamin: and the event never fires again, so pretty sure thats down
[14:01] thinkjson: but if you don't know what's holding up the event loop, you might have some deeper structural issues in your program
[14:01] Glenjamin: well i closed everything i thought it might be
[14:01] Glenjamin: assuming what i think keeps it open is accurate
[14:01] thinkjson: if I were you, I would comment out functionality until it closes cleanly on its own

[14:05] Glenjamin: like, the handle to stdout doesn't, but what if i open a file
[14:05] thinkjson: Glenjamin: I don't believe so. At least not available to the program at run time. You can debug with V8's dev tools.
[14:05] r04r has joined the channel
[14:05] jmar777: teslan: node.js is basically a container for v8 with a nice set of core libraries. so it hardly even counts as a new runtime in that regard
[14:05] thinkjson: teslan: you think I'm a n00b?
[14:06] teslan: then, inside a function should this.varName not work where varName works?
[14:06] pleaz: maybe anything in this: var path = require('path'),
[14:06] pleaz: 	config = module.exports = {};
[14:07] thinkjson: teslan: depends on the code

[14:08] diegoviola: wow, node.js feels pretty fast

[14:09] zivester has joined the channel
[14:09] jmar777: it's definitely up there with the best of the interpreted language runtimes
[14:09] teslan: say i start up 'node app.js' whose main body contains var myVar = {..} then should this.myVar not be valid from within any (non callback) function?
[14:09] diegoviola: i mean, running a simple ruby/sinatra script vs a node.js/express script, it takes longer for the sinatra script to run than the express one

[14:12] diegoviola: thinkjson: node/express: real    0m0.417s
[14:12] thinkjson: startup means nothing
[14:12] diegoviola: yeah ok
[14:12] jmar777: thinkjson: if you're doing a significant amount of CPU-bound tasks, then a naive implementation in node will bog down your event loop and you'll start refusing connections
[14:13] urlisse has joined the channel
[14:13] diegoviola: thinkjson: but still, node feels faster
[14:13] thinkjson: compared to 120s for tomcat ;-)
[14:13] jmar777: but rails will just spin up more threads - may not be especially "fast", but it'll handle requests
[14:13] thinkjson: diegoviola: that's because it scales down better
[14:13] thinkjson: so in development, it feels faster
[14:13] diegoviola: ok

[14:14] CarterL has joined the channel
[14:14] jmar777: but if you are, for example, just running a bunch of queries against a database or fielding stuff from an API, node will be able to scale better in terms of overall throughput per cpu
[14:14] thinkjson: the nice thing about Node.js is that you can serve the same reqs/sec as Rails with much less expensive hardware because it runs really lean
[14:14] diegoviola: i've started with php, then went with rails, then with ramaze/sinatra/rack, and now i'm checking out node
[14:14] diegoviola: thinkjson: nice

[14:15] diegoviola: i've grown tired of rails

[14:15] thinkjson: I can serve 5000 reqs/sec in production on an m1.small (minus the overhead of I/O)
[14:15] thinkjson: it's definitely a different way to go about things
[14:15] jmar777: thinkjson: we ran some fairly extensive tests between node and some jetty servlets. for in-memory responses, they were on par with each other, provided we had at least one node process per cpu
[14:15] diva has joined the channel
[14:15] jmar777: thinkjson: but the moment there was IO involved, node killed jetty
[14:15] thinkjson: jmar777: true - I/O should be on par

[14:16] diegoviola: thinkjson: yep they have many pros too
[14:16] thinkjson: some people are more productive in SQL, some with ORMs
[14:16] diegoviola: thinkjson: right
[14:16] jmar777: thinkjson: exactly - which is why i said node can edge out some compiled runtimes because of architectural reasons. if you're running non-blocking IO on a compiled language, you should be able to beat node
[14:17] thinkjson: it doesn't matter how you get to production as long as you ship
[14:17] r04r has joined the channel
[14:17] jmar777: thinkjson: assuming you're doing it smart (i.e., not spinning up a new thread per request anyway)
[14:17] thinkjson: jmar777: right. but NIO on Java is a PITA
[14:17] Glenjamin: jmar777: if you hand optimise your code, you should always beat node. if you don't then the JIT may beat you
[14:17] teslan: so, why does this output ... undefined 'marry' ...
[14:17] teslan: var name = 'joe';
[14:17] teslan: func();
[14:17] teslan: function func() {
[14:17] teslan: var name = 'marry';
[14:17] teslan: console.log (this.name, name);
[14:17] teslan: }
[14:17] thinkjson: right - thread pools, which most servlet engines do for you
[14:17] rwaldron has joined the channel
[14:17] jmar777: thinkjson: no argument there :)
[14:17] diegoviola: thinkjson: the problem is not really ORMs per se, I like Sequel a lot (in Ruby), the problem that I have/had is when dealing with complex (long) SQL queries with multiples JOINs and such.
[14:18] thinkjson: teslan: yeah, no. just name
[14:18] thinkjson: name is global in the module
[14:18] diegoviola: thinkjson: or when dealing with a custom database that has not been desigend with the ORM in mind
[14:18] Glenjamin: teslan: because you dont understand how context binding of this works?
[14:18] diegoviola: thinkjson: ActiveRecord used to get in my way there
[14:18] thinkt4nk has joined the channel
[14:18] Glenjamin: remove the "var" from name = 'joe';
[14:18] thinkjson: teslan: so you are creating a local name in the function. you're muddling with your namespaces.
[14:18] Glenjamin: and it'll do joe, marry
[14:18] teslan: Glenjamin: you mean to tell me 'this' only works when a function is applied to an object and since none of that is here then i get undefined?
[14:19] Glenjamin: no, this refers to global when not called on an object or set
[14:19] RyanD has joined the channel
[14:19] thinkjson: teslan: javascript 101. do some research on js namespaces.
[14:19] thinkjson: but in node, this !== global
[14:20] thinkjson: so name won't be in this
[14:20] jerkelens has joined the channel
[14:20] thinkjson: in your code, this refers to the function
[14:20] thinkjson: so this.name is undefined
[14:20] thinkjson: if you want to use the name at the top in your function, don't redefine it
[14:20] pleaz: require.paths.unshift(__dirname + '/lib'); -> var async = require('async'); ->  Error: require.paths is removed. Use node_modules folders, or the NODE_PATH environment variable instead.
[14:21] Glenjamin: pleaz: so do what it says?
[14:21] jmar777: teslan: in the browser, `this` refers to the window (unless otherwise bound), which is also the global scope. the scopes are a little different in node
[14:21] Glenjamin: don't attempt to modify require.paths
[14:21] thinkjson: Glenjamin: lol
[14:21] thinkjson: jmar777: s/different/better/
[14:21] teslan: thinkjson: if inside function we rename name to name2 we get same thing ... now, is what i wrote not work in browser?
[14:22] teslan: jmar777: thanks
[14:22] jmar777: teslan: what you wrote will work in the browser...
[14:22] thinkjson: this.name in the browser would be the same as name because you've declared it in the global scope
[14:22] thinkjson: but the inner name will be different than this.name
[14:22] pleaz: i don't modify him

[14:22] teslan: thinkjson: who can they be the same when one name is main body and the other is inside a function ?
[14:23] jmar777: teslan: inside of func(), if you wrote `console.log(window.name, this.name);`, you'd see that they're both 'joe'
[14:23] teslan: who=how*

[14:24] jmar777: too much baggage carried over from other languages, but just my opinion.
[14:24] thinkjson: you're welcome to it, but that's what they are
[14:25] jmar777: javascript doesn't really have "namespace". it has scopes, and you can quasi-namespace your stuff by using objects - but that's not really the same thing
[14:25] thinkjson: fair enough
[14:25] Glenjamin: modules are sort-of-sandboxed
[14:25] jmar777: the only thing javascript has that actually mimics traditional namespace behavior was the `with` keyword, which is definitely not in the "Good Parts" ;P
[14:25] briancray has joined the channel
[14:25] markwubben has joined the channel
[14:25] Glenjamin: which is the key difference here

[14:26] dodo has joined the channel
[14:26] Glenjamin: those are scopes imo
[14:26] thinkjson: so if you define "name" in both, you'll only get the one defined in the function

[14:28] ningu: hey, I have a question about mongoose. I have a schema with an ObjectId field. let's say I have a Book schema and each book has an ObjectId to the Author collection. basically I want to be able to set a Book's author by passing in the author's name, and have mongoose automatically look up the id (assume author names are unique).
[14:28] c4milo has joined the channel
[14:29] r04r has joined the channel
[14:29] ningu: I've tried a few ways of doing this with hooks, virtuals, etc. but I can't find a good way to do it. the type is checked before hooks are called, so an error is thrown that it's an invalid ObjectId.
[14:29] ningu: and with virtuals, I can't do an async call.
[14:29] piscisaureus__ has joined the channel
[14:29] josh-k has joined the channel
[14:30] ningu: so I'm wondering if there is really any clean way to do it.
[14:30] jmar777: ningu: ya, i couldn't find a workaround for that either. i just have some static "fromAPIObject()" methods defined on my schemas
[14:30] ningu: jmar777: yeah, that's the only way I could think of. seems a bit ugly but it would work.
[14:30] swhit has joined the channel
[14:30] jmar777: ningu: they provide an asynchronous interface, so i can just pass in the data exactly as i get it from a client, it gets sanitized, hydrated, etc.
[14:31] ningu: what I would want for this case is not a static method -- I'd rather do book.setAuthor(...)
[14:31] colinclark has joined the channel
[14:32] ashishg has joined the channel
[14:32] ningu: well, actually, either static or dynamic could work depending on what I want to do. both are slightly more complicated than I'd like, but apparently that's the only option. oh well.
[14:32] jmar777: ningu: if that makes more sense in your case, then go for it. BookSchema.methods.setAuthor = function(author, cb) {};
[14:33] Glenjamin: ningu: have some sort of BookFactory which makes a book instance with the looked-up author?
[14:33] davidsklar has joined the channel
[14:34] jmar777: ningu: i don't know if it's a good idea or not, but an asynchronous setter could be handy. basically just hold off validation and write operations until the setter invokes a callback
[14:34] r04r has joined the channel
[14:34] r04r has joined the channel

[16:23] joshthecoder has joined the channel
[16:23] TimTimTim: probably a dumb question but... if i use a synchonous function, it only blocks the thread(s) for current process/connection right?  so if a few clients query node at once and a sync function is called, only one of the clients is blocked?
[16:23] bj0rn2 has joined the channel
[16:24] bbbb: TimTimTim it blocks everything in the current process JS wise

[16:24] aranw has joined the channel
[16:24] dscape: bbbb: how would you do it generically ? Like, is this a Datatype or a function ?
[16:24] bj0rn2: say, in a http server type node application, if a request handler callback gets stuck in a loop will this mean the whole application will be stuck? any good way to handle this?

[16:25] Glenjamin: don't loop
[16:25] dob_: Never heard about zeromq, isn't it possible to distribute tasks via hook.io?
[16:25] Glenjamin: well, don't loop synchronously
[16:25] AvianFlu: bj0rn2, a request handler is a bad place for a big loop
[16:25] Glenjamin: or farm out to other processes
[16:25] bj0rn2: AvianFlu: sure it is, but bugs are known to be coded.. :)
[16:25] davehamptonusa has left the channel
[16:26] TimTimTim: bbbb, by process you mean the process induced by a connection/client's query? or the overall node app process?
[16:26] AvianFlu: bj0rn2, I had a great one happen like that with our irc bot a few months back
[16:26] AvianFlu: the twitter connection would just time out, endlessly
[16:26] SamWhited has joined the channel
[16:26] AvianFlu: but it was in its own process, so it was cool
[16:26] ts__: dob_: i think hook.io can be used to distribute task yeah
[16:27] bbbb: TimTimTim the overall app process if you do not use cluster, or a single worker otherwise
[16:27] AvianFlu: then I checked... and saw someone trying to use a `while(true)` to parse data chunks in a request handler

[16:27] bbbb: dscape that is a generic solution, you are checking something where both are typeof 'function' but want to see if one is Function constructor
[16:28] TimTimTim: sorry for the newbie questions, i'm a newb O:)
[16:28] ts__: TimTimTim: nop you need to use the cluster module to take advantage of multiple core
[16:28] dob_: That's okay. I just want to upload videos and push encoding tasks to subscribed servers. New tasks should be blocked until the encoding on this machine is completed.
[16:28] TimTimTim: hmmm ok i'll look into that when i get the chance, thanks!
[16:28] bbbb: TimTimTim it will in C++ land but JS will still be tied to a single thread without workers

[16:34] ts__: zeromq is just a more advanced socket lib . It will handle reconnections, buffering sent and received message and guarantee that each message is sent and received in a single piece
[16:34] teslan: bbbb: i am doing a bit of url "rewriting" to the effect of "/you/want/this" becoming "/get/it/here"

[20:39] EhevuTov: coredump, I think maybe it's something to do with the serverside
[20:39] Kevlar_: coredump: just to clarify, it seems here you are setting the hostname for each.. and identifying each socket by its hostname in the clients variable, is that correct?
[20:39] coredump: @kevlar yes
[20:39] coredump: Kevlar_, each clients emits a 'set hostname', hostname on the 'connected' event
[20:40] Kevlar_: coredump: so then when sendign to all the clients.. would i loop through the clients variable and send to all.. or do I just broadcast on the clients var
[20:40] EhevuTov: coredump, I think the high level difference between your app and mine, is that I broadcast, while I think you probably try to make a connection to a previous connection
[20:40] spolu has joined the channel
[20:40] coredump: EhevuTov, I try yo make a brand new connection
[20:40] coredump: I expected a error really
[20:41] coredump: because the port cant be reached
[20:41] coredump: Kevlar_, I would use socket.emit
[20:41] coredump: if you emit on the socket.io object, instead of the callback socket object, you send to all clients connected

[20:45] EhevuTov: coredump, you could answer this question then: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9334360/why-is-my-socket-io-express-app-just-sending-to-the-senders-client

[21:27] db42: if i write npm install express somewhere, where does it put it ?
[21:27] isaacs: db42: npm faq <-- run that, read the first few entries
[21:27] isaacs: it's kinda like bundler.
[21:28] isaacs: db42: it puts it in ./node_modules
[21:28] daniel`: this has got to be one of the most fucked-up things in Javascript: "foo" instanceof String === false && 123 instanceof Number === false
[21:28] isaacs: it tells you when you install it
[21:28] maxogden: clockwize: a) block is improper terminology b) you want to use a callback
[21:28] db42: ohh, thanks, will check
[21:28] maxogden: daniel`: http://wtfjs.com has worse
[21:28] isaacs: db42: srsly, though, read `npm faq`

[21:30] db42: any mac users here ? any idea why ~/.bashrc isn't being read ?
[21:31] mc: db42: you want ~/.bash_profile
[21:31] daniel`: maxogden: or (if it existed) Math.sum() === 0 && Math.product() === 1
[21:31] db42: ohh, thanks :)
[21:31] context: or just ~/.profile
[21:31] clockwize: i think if you have an .profile or .bash_profile they get called instead
[21:31] db42: context export is bash ?
[21:31] context: what
[21:31] db42: export won't work in other shells, but nm, worked
[21:32] mc: .bash_profile is for login shells, .bashrc is for non-login shells

[21:41] sauerbraten: ramitos, maybe this: http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/all.html#fs.Stats
[21:41] sauerbraten: I guess it is access time, modify time and creation time
[21:42] ramitos: sauerbraten I will test, but I think it's --change time--, --access time-- and --modify time--
[21:42] ramitos: http://www.brandonhutchinson.com/ctime_atime_mtime.html
[21:44] TheJH: I think I'm really convinced now: I want a small, energy-efficient thing here that can run bots and little servers and stuff. maybe with 512MB or 1GB RAM, and under 5W energy consumption. What are good devices for that?
[21:44] sauerbraten: ramitos, what is the difference between change time and modify time? just that changetime gets reset when permissions change but contents stay the same?
[21:44] sauerbraten: TheJH, pandaboard?

[23:06] megalomix: so i need to use nginx <---> wordpress
[23:06] jaha: lohkey: yea, ive been looking into dnode as well, but having problems finding some answers, dont suppose you would know how to access a client's methods from outside dnode? cant get my head around how that would work after i store the connected clients in an object
[23:06] megalomix: but i also would like to develop a website in node (i already have this website) so i don't want to write in in PHP
[23:06] megalomix: can i use NGINX and NODE togheter ?

[23:06] iain_: megalomix: nginx infront of node shouldn't be a problem

[23:10] iain_: having nginx in the way isn't going to have a performance impact, though I'm not sure how fast node is with ssl processing
[23:10] megalomix: iain_, slower for the user because the request makes ONE more step
[23:10] iain_: if ngnix is better at ssl than node, then nginx reverse proxy is a damn good idea
[23:10] iain_: the user won't notice
[23:10] megalomix: ok
[23:11] iain_: I could name several big websites that have a much more complex setup than what you've described
[23:11] iain_: and no one notices
[23:11] iain_: the extra time
[23:11] megalomix: iain_, what do you mean with this setup? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5009324/node-js-nginx-and-now
[23:11] megalomix: ah perfect
[23:11] megalomix: *what do you think

[23:30] isaacs: sauerbraten: change time refers to flags on the file.
[23:31] sauerbraten: isaacs, but on the content as well right? means: when mtime changes, ctime changes, too. but when ctimes changes, mtime does not change necessarily?

[23:37] isaacs: sauerbraten: but, if you change the owner, or explicitly set the mtime/atime using utimes, or update the mode, then ctime updates.
