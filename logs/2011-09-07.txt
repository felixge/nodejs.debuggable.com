[01:13] zhujo01 has joined the channel
[01:14] random123: The categorization of thr Node wiki modules page was nice, the only thing comparable in the npm is Tags, which are really disorganized
[01:14] zhujo01 has joined the channel
[01:15] random123: I think it would be nice if the npm counted downloads and you can see most popular
[01:15] random123: And it has some real categorization with oversight
[01:15] random123: as a way to navigate
[01:15] Utkarsh has joined the channel
[01:16] random123: the tags would work with oversight as well, or even oversight by user participation instead of individual authors
[01:17] Daegalus has joined the channel
[01:18] random123: but the only way of usefully navigating the npm currently is either, searching up a specific package or seeing Depended On ranking, Most popular by downloads would be better than that particular case though
[01:20] Daegalus has joined the channel
[01:24] tjholowaychuk: abravo evaaa

[01:31] daleharvey: im kinda hoping it already exists, but if not sounds like a fun yak to shave
[01:32] tjholowaychuk: random123  maybe it's hard/not possible with couch unless you have some layer in front

[01:37] luke`_ has joined the channel
[01:37] random123: Nexxy: Thats the point of finding what is most popular though, it sort of implies an opinion of the populous of people looking for packages
[01:37] drudge: TooTallNate: which version did you grab, direct or app store?
[01:37] random123: Nexxy: ie What people are using
[01:37] TooTallNate: drudge: direct
[01:38] Nexxy: random123, all I'm saying is that an endorsement/vote is more reliable than d/l count
[01:38] Nexxy: :)
[01:38] random123: Nexxy: Well they could put a voting feature in the NPM as well
[01:38] Nexxy: do I hear a pull request?
[01:39] tjholowaychuk: Nexxy not really though, because the downloads initially are most likely going to be from word of mouth as well
[01:39] tjholowaychuk: votes could be worse in some ways
[01:40] neoesque has joined the channel
[01:40] Nexxy: clearly this calls for some sort of scoring algorithm!
[01:40] tjholowaychuk: boom!
[01:40] random123: It seems GitHub "Watches" are the relative equivalent for instance, interestingly they don't actually count downloads either. But many people use something they do not Watch, download count is something that is an accurate and happens gracefully and consistent
[01:40] ayo has joined the channel
[01:41] cognominal_ has joined the channel
[01:42] tjholowaychuk: random123 i guess it would suck if you have someone deploying 100s of times a week etc causing the downloads to go up
[01:43] Nexxy: the only reason I mentioned votes is that I could foresee great libs being passed up for others that have more downloads
[01:43] Nexxy: simply because they have broader uses
[01:43] tjholowaychuk: Nexxy sure
[01:43] tjholowaychuk: but can you not see marak bitching about every lib?

[01:43] Nexxy: what's he bitching about? ;o
[01:43] tjholowaychuk: it'll be skewed regardless
[01:44] Nexxy: I think this calls for a board certified peer reviewed NPM ranking system

[01:47] random123: inflating the count
[01:47] Nexxy: that just seems unnecessarily resource intensive
[01:48] tjholowaychuk: npm is already slow
[01:48] tjholowaychuk: dont want to slow it down
[01:48] tjholowaychuk: more
[01:48] tjholowaychuk: i guess
[01:48] random123: It shouldn't be slow, unless bandwidth is the issue
[01:48] tjholowaychuk: some kind of quality thing would be nice though but i guess people should just review libs before using them on github
[01:48] jheusala: is this kind of library done already? Express-style middleware SQL framework: https://gist.github.com/1199537

[01:50] broofa has joined the channel
[01:50] random123: I would guess if there was a restful API, it just curls it on download, passing package_id, mac_address, on the other end, if that mac_address has already downloaded then do not up count
[01:51] random123: maybe take 40ms
[01:51] Nexxy: but who's responsible for that giant sack of MAC addresses?
[01:51] Nexxy: just think of the liability!
[01:52] steffan_ has joined the channel
[01:52] random123: I don't think mac address really allows you to know anything important
[01:52] random123: Its just a hardware signature on the nic

[01:54] Nexxy: I was speaking more to the aspect of upkeep
[01:54] daleharvey: is Matt Ranney / mrannry around these parts?

[02:47] piscisaureus: agoole: if you have problems with express use node 0.4.11
[02:47] piscisaureus: agoole: the 0.5 branch is unstable

[02:48] piscisaureus: agoole: and if you have problems with git, just grab the tarball from http://nodejs.org/#download

[02:59] agoole: piscisaureus: thank you, I checked out a previous version and got express working,
[02:59] agoole: piscisaureus: but thanks for the heads up about the branch being unstable,
[02:59] agoole: piscisaureus: good to know when we're about to build a server on it
[02:59] agoole: hahah
[03:00] piscisaureus: agoole: that's fine, but don't be surprised if node 0.5/master blows up in your face :-)
[03:00] agoole: haha
[03:00] piscisaureus: agoole: the rule is that 0.odd versions are unstable and 0.even versions are stable
[03:00] agoole: I think we'll downgrade to a stable version, we are running a linode machine for it, 
[03:00] agoole: so we'd rather use git
[03:01] agoole: but thanks for the heads up
[03:02] brainproxy: agoole: you might want to look into nvm
[03:02] brainproxy: makes installing/switching between different versions of node a breeze
[03:05] CarterA: What are the other options for node version managers? I seem to remember them being a ton of them.
[03:05] brainproxy: i think there are mainly two now, could be mistaken though
[03:05] Daegalus has joined the channel
[03:05] brainproxy: Caswell's nvm
[03:05] CarterA: nvm and ...?
[03:06] brainproxy: and isaacs' tool, trying to remember the name

[03:06] CarterA: ah, nave

[03:06] brainproxy: ah, that's right

[04:22] Nexxy: I would take opera over IE
[04:22] caffine has joined the channel
[04:22] tbranyen: Opera is like in between Chrome and a browser that hasn't been invented yet that is better than everything else
[04:22] Nuck: It's powerful, but it reminds me of the era of the Application Suite
[04:22] blkcat: mmm, chrome.
[04:23] Nuck: Probably because even years after Application Suites died, Opera remains
[04:23] Nexxy: O mouse gestures were amazing
[04:23] tbranyen: i paid damn good money for opera back in the day
[04:23] Nuck: And then it wnet free and you raged?
[04:23] tbranyen: i intend on getting my monies worth
[04:24] Nexxy: no, I commended them for that
[04:24] Nuck: Opera is a VERY good browser
[04:24] Nuck: I'll admit that
[04:24] Nexxy: oh that was to tbranyen ;P
[04:24] Nuck: It's the most standards-compliant
[04:24] Aiden_ has joined the channel

[04:24] Nexxy: are you talking about presto?
[04:24] Nuck: And it's pioneering in UI
[04:25] Nuck: However, Opera is not exactly cutting-edge when it comes to CSS3 or HTML5
[04:25] tbranyen: its not?
[04:25] tbranyen: say whaaaat
[04:25] Nexxy: it has all the -o- variants I've needed
[04:26] StanlySoManly has joined the channel
[04:26] Nuck: By the time every modern browser had 90% of the CSS3 stuff built (webkit was at 99%), they were just starting
[04:26] tbranyen: so what? thats old
[04:26] Nuck: Webkit is always cutting-edge on that
[04:26] tbranyen: modern opera is what you should be commenting on
[04:26] Nuck: Mostly because they *invent* everything
[04:26] tbranyen: shit changes every month
[04:26] Nuck: tbranyen: They showed they lagged
[04:26] tbranyen: and?
[04:26] tbranyen: so did mozilla
[04:26] tbranyen: they are working on catching up as well
[04:26] Nuck: Yeah, and I no longer use Firefox either
[04:26] tbranyen: and safari is even worse
[04:27] Nuck: But Firefox was at least partaking in the standards

[06:01] JoeCA: they use V8 with Gwan, and they talk about comparing it to node, ... and it is 2- 9 times faster than NodeJS
[06:01] Nexxy: where have I heard that before

[06:06] Nexxy: I learned of DMT on something like erowid many moons ago
[06:06] brainproxy: if you could build some discovery/routing mechanisms into it, the principle could be used to build out a mesh network on the fly which could, say, link phones behind an otherwise firewalled network into the open Internet
[06:06] JoeCA: yes, 
[06:06] joshkehn: Looks like V8 doesn't run on PPC so Node won't either.

[14:10] Nuck: CS is horrible
[14:10] Raynos: eazyigz: guess you'll have to learn it, its not that bad
[14:10] Nuck: Hideous language
[14:11] industrial: sticks and stones, your opinion, etc
[14:11] Nuck: Not nearly as elegant as JavaScript
[14:11] Raynos: CS isn't that bad. It's like comparing VB & C#
[14:11] Raynos: Sure C# is better but VB is not that bad
[14:11] Nuck: Raynos: Yeah, you'd never use VB for anything SERIOUS, though
[14:11] Nuck: That's the difference
[14:11] industrial: Nuck: guess you dont like python and ruby either then
[14:11] Nuck: People are using CS for serious projects
[14:11] Raynos: Nuck: VB.NET and C#.NET are feature equivelant
[14:11] Raynos: it's just personal preference

[14:12] Raynos: CS and JS are feature complete, its personal preference

[14:12] shiawuen has joined the channel
[14:12] Nuck: Raynos: CS and JS are not the same features

[14:12] Nuck: There's an obvious divide there
[14:12] Glenjamin: eugh, why are people always trying to do classical in JS
[14:12] Raynos: Nuck: lies.
[14:12] Raynos: You dont have to use classical OO in CS
[14:12] Raynos: although I also hate classical OO emulation
[14:12] Glenjamin: util.inherits is all you need
[14:12] Nuck: Glenjamin: My sentiments exactly
[14:12] industrial: lies indeed, CS compiled TO js so it is always prototypal inheritance
[14:13] Raynos: ew util.inherits :(
[14:13] Nuck: industrial: Nope, CS has classical emulation
[14:13] Raynos: Use object.create
[14:13] Raynos: Nuck: you dont have to use it
[14:13] Raynos: Avoid `class` like its poison
[14:13] Glenjamin: util.inherits uses object.create
[14:13] industrial: I'd rather have a proper OO implemented in JS
[14:13] Glenjamin: but also sets constructor
[14:13] topaxi has joined the channel
[14:13] Nuck: Raynos: Sure, but it's a language feature, so people will use it
[14:13] Nuck: And that's bad
[14:13] aaronmcadam: CS does lotsa crazy stuff with __super__
[14:14] Raynos: Nuck: I agree. CS is silly

[14:15] industrial: rejoice, Raynos.
[14:15] Nuck: Raynos: I'm not a fan of Harmony.  Never have been, never will be
[14:15] Nuck: JS is prototypical
[14:15] Nuck: It's built around that
[14:15] Nuck: You can't just add classes
[14:15] aaronmcadam: i don't think harmony will come to fruition for a long time
[14:15] Nuck: It really doesn't work like that
[14:15] Raynos: Well harmony has some nice things, just classical OO is an abomination
[14:15] aaronmcadam: yeah, that's silly
[14:15] Raynos: I also dont like util.inherits
[14:15] Glenjamin: why not?
[14:15] Nuck: I do yearn for classical OO
[14:16] Nuck: But JS is prototypical and I accept that
[14:16] Raynos: I use object.create directly : http://raynos.github.com/vows-fluent/docs/vows-fluent.html
[14:16] aaronmcadam: hehe prototypical :)
[14:16] Raynos: And I like inheriting from objects not functions.
[14:16] Glenjamin: Raynos: i could take or leave .super_, but setting constructor properly is great
[14:16] industrial: I prefer Lua's OO model (metatables)
[14:16] Raynos: `new` and `.prototype` are evil aswell
[14:16] industrial: to JS
[14:16] Raynos: Glenjamin I dont need the constructor property, I dont use constructors
[14:16] Glenjamin: it's crockford in disguise!
[14:16] Nuck: Raynos: new *is* evil
[14:16] Glenjamin: why?
[14:16] Nuck: But prototypes are faster in V8
[14:17] Raynos: You dont need it
[14:17] Nuck: By a HUGE margin
[14:17] Nuck: Something like 10x faster
[14:17] Raynos: Ugh micro optimisation
[14:17] Nuck: With lower memory footprint
[14:17] aaronmcadam: yeah new is awful
[14:17] aaronmcadam: literals ftw
[14:17] Nuck: So for something with many instances, I'm gonna use prototypes
[14:17] davve: um
[14:17] davve: just be sure to delete
[14:17] Glenjamin: i dont *need* higher order functions, but i still use them
[14:17] davve: if you use new
[14:17] dnjaramba has joined the channel
[14:17] Sorella: Nuck, how is `new' evil? It's just a keyword, it does no evilness.
[14:17] Nuck: However, I'll use a function for something that'll have a few things
[14:17] Glenjamin: why would i not use new and prototype?
[14:17] Sorella: s/keyword/operator/
[14:17] davve: if you
[14:18] davve: re worried about gc
[14:18] Raynos: Sorella: it has a java API
[14:18] Raynos: you don't need the new keyword
[14:18] Nuck: Sorella: It misbehaves a lot, like it breaks with natives
[14:18] herbySk has joined the channel
[14:18] Raynos: You should be using Object.create instead
[14:18] Sorella: that is true, you could just use Object.create
[14:18] Sorella: I like new with constructors though, they look nice :3
[14:18] Raynos: new encourages classical OO
[14:18] Raynos: I dont use constructors, I use factories.
[14:18] Sorella: Raynos, heh, it doesn't.

[14:20] Sorella: Though I don't go with long prototypical chains, just use traits instead.
[14:21] Nuck: I just wish I had the *syntax* of class-based setups, even if we remained with prototypical inheritance
[14:21] Glenjamin: you can only do traits with copying though, no?
[14:21] Nuck: It's just that prototypes are so fucking wordy
[14:21] dylang has joined the channel
[14:21] Sorella: Glenjamin, yeah. Traits on the prototype directly though, not on a per-instance basis.

[14:22] Nuck: I want a block that acts as a closure, mostly
[14:22] Nuck: Sorella: Yeah, but it's not nearly as efficient
[14:22] Sorella: Object.create is what's awful. defineProperties should use a friendlier syntax.
[14:22] Glenjamin: https://github.com/glenjamin/nodespec/blob/master/lib/example-group.js is my preferred method of defining "classes"

[14:25] Raynos: Use one or the other
[14:26] jrbran_ has joined the channel

[14:28] Sorella: pd does look nice though.
[14:28] Sorella: Raynos, yep, just style preference.
[14:28] Sorella: It lets me organise my code the way I see fit, rather than the way the parser will read it.
[14:28] Glenjamin: Sorella: which part do you consider verbose?
[14:28] hackband has joined the channel
[14:28] Raynos: Glenjamin propertydescriptors are verbose as hell
[14:29] Glenjamin: can't disagree there
[14:29] Raynos: Oh the code was verbose not pd
[14:29] Sorella: Glenjamin, most of it, I'd say.
[14:29] Glenjamin: you prefer assigning an object literal to the prototype?
[14:29] Raynos: I prefer object literals myself
[14:29] Raynos: but then again I have small objects and mix them together
[14:30] Raynos: My object literals dont tend to get larger then the screen height so its manageable
[14:30] Sorella: Glenjamin, yep. I also prefer functions over getters/setters.
[14:30] Sorella: but eh, that's a matter of personal styles, methinks.
[14:30] Glenjamin: mm
[14:31] Glenjamin: When its an API thats going to be used a fair bit, i'd rather the API code be a bit more verbose than the caller be more verbose
[14:31] Sorella: Glenjamin, you can have conciseness in both sides, though :3
[14:31] Raynos: Also ew jsdoc ;)
[14:31] Raynos: or whatever that is
[14:31] Glenjamin: it's natural docs
[14:32] Glenjamin: because i couldn't find anything better
[14:32] Glenjamin: and i'd like to keep my docs next to my methods

[14:32] aaronmcadam: isn't it easier to get docs out of sync if u hand write em
[14:32] Sorella: Like not being able to define custom blocks.

[14:33] Glenjamin: i'm not really on board with docco, reading code and reading docs are two separate use cases
[14:33] Illusioneer has left the channel
[14:33] Raynos: Glenjamin but that depends what docs is
[14:34] Sorella: Glenjamin, I like literate programming, only I think it should describe WHY the code does something, people usually describe what the code does =/
[14:34] Raynos: there is the code and there is the high level API overview
[14:34] Raynos: You need both
[14:34] Glenjamin: this lib has a public API, which has the docs - the implementation details are just that, and are free to change wildly
[14:34] Raynos: docco just annotates the code so its more readable
[14:34] Vertice has joined the channel
[14:35] Raynos: I agree we need an API documentation solution
[14:35] Glenjamin: be more verbose, then you wont need so much annotation :p
[14:35] Raynos: but natural docs & jsdoc dont work
[14:35] Raynos: Glenjamin: I dont need documentation, other people do ;)
[14:35] Glenjamin: we were brainstorming some ideas with DrMcKay the other day
[14:35] Raynos: Like for example,
[14:35] Raynos: the connect, express & npm source code is a pain to grok
[14:35] Raynos: If that was annotated it would be easier
[14:35] Glenjamin: then it's bad code :p
[14:35] Sorella: I found natural docs actually interesting.
[14:36] dguttman has joined the channel
[14:36] Glenjamin: naturaldocs was the best solution i found
[14:36] Raynos: I hate API definitions in my code, is all
[14:36] Sorella: but I'd prefer much something written in javascript, so I could freely extend it to my likings.
[14:36] Raynos: The best solution is hand made documentation
[14:36] Glenjamin: because it didn't attempt to parse the source too much
[14:36] cjroebuck has joined the channel
[14:36] Glenjamin: except as you already said
[14:36] Glenjamin: its out of sync

[14:45] Sorella: Glenjamin, I've started a documentation toolkit in JavaScript that's something between docco and Natural Docs. Really early stages though, and I'm more worried in integrating it all in Emacs' org-mode.
[14:46] Glenjamin: fn(target, method, dfn) = Object.defineProperty(target, method, { get: dfn }) - not sure what i'd call the module though
[14:46] Glenjamin: Sorella: any WIP i can look at?
[14:46] Sorella: Glenjamin, it would be interesting having a pre-processor for some of the stuff coming in ES6. The new property descriptor literal is better iirc
[14:47] Glenjamin: I'm thinking that because there's such a wide array of definition styles (as we just demonstrated), declaring the signature in the docblock is going to be better than trying to parse it

[14:49] Glenjamin: not a huge fan of the ///////, but i like the general approach :)
[14:51] Sorella: Glenjamin, well, the slashes after the heading text are optional. The starting ones define the heading nesting.

[15:00] Sorella: Raynos, well, I do agree with you, but when I'm reading source, I also want the code to contain basic pieces of information like: "why that code is there? Is a function pure? Is it dependant on anything else besides the apparent things, like the time it's called?"; 2. I dislike reading comments that go directly inside the function. I think it really deviates from the reading of how something is being performed.
[15:00] Glenjamin: which is the bit you don't like about mine
[15:00] dylang: anybody try hosting images from mongodb via express?  I want to make sure i get caching (client and server) right.
[15:00] Raynos: I guess so
[15:00] Raynos: But I know my code, so its cool

[15:00] Raynos: we need documentation for other people

[15:42] Sorella: (and yes, I don't use git)
[15:42] kmiyashiro: why is setting foo.prototype = new bar(); wrong?
[15:42] kmiyashiro: something about the constructor
[15:43] CoverSlide: what's wrong with that?
[15:43] FireFly|n900 has joined the channel
[15:43] Glenjamin: if the constructor does something or takes args, it might error
[15:45] Sorella: kmiyashiro, you're executing the constructor, and you *REALLY* don't want that.
[15:45] CoverSlide: it would have to depend on what bar() is. I personally use `foo.prototype = Object.create(bar.prototype)` when I can
[15:45] Glenjamin: util.inherits for me :)
[15:45] kmiyashiro: right, Object.create doesn't execute the constructor
[15:45] kmiyashiro: but all the answers on stack overflow and most of the internet say to do that
[15:46] CoverSlide: if you're not on ES5 you don't have much choice
[15:46] Glenjamin: they're generally from before Object.create, and they have to worry about browser compat
[15:46] kmiyashiro: but there's a polyfill for Object.create, isn't there?
[15:47] caolanm has joined the channel
[15:47] CoverSlide: the polyfill executes the constructor anyway
[15:47] Glenjamin: Object.create = function(src) { var f = function(){}; f.prototype = src; return new f() };
[15:47] Raynos: kmiyashiro its wrong because :(. Use object.create
[15:47] Glenjamin: CoverSlide: doens't have to
[15:48] kmiyashiro: Glenjamin: but isn't that executing the constructor?
[15:48] Raynos: Really you want var foo = Object.create(bar, { ... })
[15:48] CoverSlide: oh right
[15:48] CoverSlide: personally haven't used the polyfill myself
[15:48] vikstrous__ has joined the channel
[15:48] Glenjamin: kmiyashiro: nope, it creates a new empty constructor and steals the prototype of the original
[15:48] Raynos: using `.prototype` and constructors is also iffy
[15:48] Sorella: kmiyashiro, if you're in Node.js, you don't need to worry about ES5 support. If you need to support shitty IE browsers, just include es5-shim.js and save your sanity.
[15:48] CoverSlide: Raynos: we're talking about foo being the `class`, not the `instance`
[15:49] socialhack has joined the channel
[15:49] CoverSlide: so that from there you can do `var baz = Object.create(foo.prototype)`
[15:49] kmiyashiro: ic

[15:51] Glenjamin: new > __proto__
[15:51] kmiyashiro: what?
[15:51] Raynos: ES3 you do var foo = {}; foo.__proto__ = bar
[15:51] softdrink has joined the channel
[15:51] ph^ has joined the channel
[15:51] Raynos: Same thing, there is no class-instance relationship. But this is noise
[15:51] Sorella: var foo = {__proto__: bar}
[15:51] Sorella: but meh Python
[15:51] Glenjamin: __proto__ is evil
[15:51] Glenjamin: for example: https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit/blob/master/lib/assert.js#L96
[15:52] Raynos: Glenjamin: it's bloody evil, don't use it :P
[15:52] Glenjamin: breaks AssertionError.call
[15:52] Raynos: kmiyashiro: http://raynos.org/blog/4/Doing-Object-Oriented-JavaScript
[15:52] Glenjamin: even if i agreed that new was evil, which I don't - i'd still use new over __proto__
[15:52] Spion_ has joined the channel
[15:52] CoverSlide: well in ES6 we'll have true classes
[15:53] Raynos: Glenjamin: I agree
[15:53] Raynos: CoverSlide: no :(
[15:53] Raynos: We don't want true classes, we want prototypical OO
[15:53] Raynos: and a better API, because Object.create & Object.defineProperties are a pain in the ass
[15:53] sub_pop has joined the channel
[15:54] Draggor: Class based OO is evil

[15:54] Raynos: Pick a related thing, complain there
[15:55] softdrink: sooooooo what does everyone think of Ender?
[15:55] CoverSlide: Ender is meh
[15:55] kmiyashiro: Raynos: why would you define properties of your new object with Object.create?
[15:55] softdrink: valid opinion
[15:55] softdrink: why meH?
[15:55] Glenjamin: it's the github file show page =/
[15:55] softdrink: hehe
[15:56] kmiyashiro: instead of afterward with foo.prototype.bar =
[15:56] Raynos: Why use ender when you have browserify
[15:56] Raynos: They both solve the same problem, browserify just does it better
[15:56] Sorella: ES6 won't have classes, it'll have classical sugar for prototypical OO.
[15:56] CoverSlide: i dunno, don't have time to tweak little micro frameworks. I'd rather just add jquery and be done with it
[15:56] Sorella: which is still bad eh
[15:56] Raynos: Sorella: evil. 
[15:56] softdrink: jquery is way too much for my current project
[15:57] Sorella: the Prototypes as "Classes" proposal looked good, but apparently they're not going with it =/
[15:57] Sorella: because "we need to support people who think JS has classical OO. It's easier for them."
[15:57] Raynos: kmiyashiro: because you have objects and you inherit from objects, also style
[15:57] socialhack has joined the channel
[15:57] eignerchris has joined the channel
[15:57] softdrink: ಠ_ಠ 
[15:57] Raynos: Sorella: thats murderous rage. We dont want people who think JS has classical OO
[15:58] Raynos: We will suffer for it
[15:58] Glenjamin: people who don't know javascript should learn it before writing it
[15:58] kmiyashiro: Raynos: I get the style part, but doesn't foo.prototype.bar = x still allow other objects to inherit bar from foo?
[15:58] tjholowaychuk: they already suffer and ignore the language as it is
[15:58] softdrink: that's like saying "We want to crap all over C so that Java developers feel more at home."
[15:58] Glenjamin: just like *every other programming language ever*
[15:58] CoverSlide: I think 75% of web devs do think that JS has classical OO
[15:58] Sorella: Glenjamin, my feelings exactly.
[15:59] DrMcKay: *ekhm* Python *ekhm*
[15:59] aaronmcadam: i wouldn't say that
[15:59] japj has joined the channel
[15:59] Glenjamin: what about python?
[15:59] Sorella: Which is why I like Racket better, they don't need to include shit directly in the language because you can just write your own on top of it.
[15:59] CoverSlide: no language is abused nearly as much as js though
[16:00] DrMcKay: Glenjamin: it doesn't fit into all other languages
[16:00] DrMcKay: it's OO is quite similar to JS one, I think
[16:00] bwinton: CoverSlide: Well, perl gives it a run for its money in that department…
[16:00] joshkehn: CoverSlide: PHP abused pretty hard.
[16:00] Sorella: CoverSlide, I also think PHP and Perl lead the way there.
[16:00] DrMcKay: joshkehn: he said "language". PHP, well...
[16:00] Glenjamin: nah, python has classical OO but with no private/protected
[16:00] onre: i tend to abuse JS but i know i'm doing it
[16:01] onre: does that make it any better :p
[16:01] joshkehn: JavaScript is abused insofar as the browser is concerned.
[16:01] Sorella: And CoffeeScript, a little.
[16:01] Glenjamin: plus python has well defined multiple inheritance semantics
[16:01] DrMcKay: Glenjamin: but you still get that power you have in JS, but not in other languages
[16:01] joshkehn: Maybe it's the Java in me, but I've never found a need for multiple inheritance. 
[16:01] tjholowaychuk: Glenjamin multiple inheritance would be sweet
[16:02] tjholowaychuk: everyone is too focused on js being more trendy though
[16:02] tjholowaychuk: instead of adding useful features
[16:02] Sorella: joshkehn, I've always found mixins/traits are far better than multiple inheritance.
[16:02] Sorella: s/are//
[16:02] joshkehn: Sorella: I agree with you there.
[16:02] aaronmcadam: hmm yeah mixins are nice
[16:02] joshkehn: tjholowaychuk: You mean add useful features to the language?
[16:02] Glenjamin: there's no real difference in python's case
[16:02] aaronmcadam: what do u think of decorators in py?
[16:02] tjholowaychuk: joshkehn yeah, brendan & friends are extremely unfocused, the language is going to shit
[16:02] DrMcKay: aaronmcadam: decorators <3
[16:02] Sorella: aaronmcadam, decorators are nice. You can almost mimic them in JS.
[16:02] tjholowaychuk: with stupid things like proxies
[16:02] aaronmcadam: :D
[16:03] aaronmcadam: yeah I read a post about how to implement em
[16:03] butu5 has joined the channel
[16:03] DrMcKay: tjholowaychuk: proxies?
[16:03] Glenjamin: they're probably not needed in JS because you have proper anonymous functions
[16:03] joshkehn: I think one of the most beautiful things about JavaScript is it's flexibility. I was not impressed with the harmony project's goals at all or Brendan's projections for the language development.
[16:04] tjholowaychuk: joshkehn 100% agree
[16:04] socialhack_ has joined the channel
[16:04] tjholowaychuk: almost none of it is necessary, we should be scaling back the garbage not adding more of it
[16:04] Sorella: joshkehn, yeah. the only think I still miss in JS are macros though. But I don't think they quite work with the C syntax.
[16:04] dpritchett has joined the channel
[16:04] CoverSlide: js just needs simple additions
[16:04] TheJH: Sorella, I built macros :)
[16:04] joshkehn: tjholowaychuk: I'm with you there. 
[16:04] Sorella: TheJH, for JS?
[16:04] CoverSlide: block scoping and destructuring assignment would be nice additions
[16:05] nevir has joined the channel
[16:05] havenn has joined the channel
[16:05] butu5 has joined the channel
[16:05] Sorella: CoverSlide, agreed. Destructuring assignment is specially nice for require calls.
[16:05] joshkehn: CoverSlide: I like the destructuring, but block scoping would wreck it. 
[16:05] Glenjamin: destructuring assignment = splat operator?
[16:05] joshkehn: I prefer the functional scoping.
[16:05] Glenjamin: or a, b = [1,2]
[16:05] TheJH: Sorella, macros file example: https://github.com/thejh/node-cempl8/blob/master/macros , source example: https://github.com/thejh/node-cempl8/blob/master/test.js+ , compilation: https://github.com/thejh/node-cempl8/blob/master/test.js

[16:06] indutny: It would be nice to hear feedback from you!
[16:06] indutny: tl;dr : new debugger API
[16:06] CoverSlide: well there are cases where block scoping would be useful
[16:06] Glenjamin: is this something that should be in core?
[16:07] Sorella: joshthecoder, I think he meant just including `let', not changing the semantics.
[16:07] nevir has left the channel
[16:07] Sorella: which I see no problem.
[16:07] indutny: Glenjamin: I hope so
[16:07] CoverSlide: yes, `let` not wrecking `var`
[16:07] joshkehn: CoverSlide: There are cases where everything would be useful. The problem is making rampant core language changes without fixing what is already broken.
[16:07] indutny: Glenjamin: That's not high-level

[16:26] halcyon918: Hey folks, I was playing with the VM module yesterday and something I noticed was that the object created in the parent context to represent the VM doesn't seem to be an EventEmitter so I can't attach listeners to it from within the VM (this.on(...))... I'd like to be able to pass messages into the VM by emitting events that the code within the VM can act on... what would be a good alternative?

[19:54] Raynos: Dont write dialects
[19:54] tjholowaychuk: i dont want Cakefiles and god damn jakefiles and coffeescript compilers
[19:54] Draggor: tjholowaychuk: a JS dialect, not a CS one
[19:54] Raynos: Write libraries and utilities
[19:54] TheJH: DrMcKay, `=` is assign, `->` is like `function(){`
[19:55] joshkehn: Don't write dialects.
[19:55] DrMcKay: I will make a COBOL to JavaScript compiler
[19:55] Raynos: If you want to write anything, write me my ES6 -> ES5 transpiler

[19:55] Draggor: JS is missing destructuring, macros, and shorthand for function(){}
[19:55] CoverSlide: Raynos: you mean traceur?
[19:55] Raynos: I can tolerate that
[19:55] joshkehn: Why do you need a shorthand for function () {} ?
[19:55] joshkehn: What's wrong with it? 
[19:55] Raynos: CoverSlide: traceur is google's toy. It's not neutral
[19:55] `3rdEden: I'm so gonna port Coldfusion to Node, so I can write my code in XML!

[19:55] tjholowaychuk: haha
[19:55] TheJH: joshkehn, it's so damned long.
[19:55] joshkehn: Dead god. Typing. The horror!
[19:55] guybrush: the thing with all those compilers and dialects and stuff is, that the community gets splitted
[19:55] Draggor: I like coffeescript's shorthand for function
[19:55] guybrush: imho
[19:56] joshkehn: Imagine typing 15 characters. That must really suck.
[19:56] Raynos: joshkehn I want to write something terser, function() is verbose
[19:56] Daegalus: Imma port Assembly to JS, then write a C compiler for it in XML, and then write a Node dialect ontop of this in C#

[19:56] Raynos: Needing a terser function is all about one line functions
[19:56] sdolard: Hi, is console.log() async?
[19:56] CoverSlide: "You've got a problem with JavaScript's syntax, so you added a compiler step. Now you've got two problems"

[19:57] Raynos: I mean DrMcKay: LIES
[19:57] CoverSlide: console.log is async
[19:57] tjholowaychuk: if programmers cant get passed syntax

[20:08] Raynos: Meh you dont need to _use_ all of his stuff
[20:08] `3rdEden: tjholowaychuk not alot people cared when we changed socket.io's repo names. What you could do after the move is re-register than account and create `dummy` repositories with README files
[20:08] `3rdEden: like https://github.com/learnboost/socket.io-node does

[20:28] ydef: i'm open to hacks. it's just so ugly :(
[20:28] tjholowaychuk: ydef dont write js
[20:28] joshkehn: What's ugly about app.get?
[20:28] tjholowaychuk: if you think it's ugly
[20:28] ydef: ( to me; I know it doesn't matter )
[20:28] tbranyen: joshkehn: there is a time and place for everything
[20:28] joshkehn: You could say
[20:28] tjholowaychuk: IMO unifiying the beginning of a line looks good
[20:28] joshkehn: (function () { this.get(…);}.bind(app)())
[20:28] tbranyen: for(var i in app) { this[i] = app[i]; }
[20:28] tbranyen: woot
[20:29] CoverSlide: except that this is more characters than app
[20:29] Sorella: Raynos, true. Though people don't have that much problems with globals in Common Lisp =/
[20:29] joshkehn: But then you still have `this` hanging off the front.
[20:29] CoverSlide: go the jquery route
[20:29] joshkehn: CoverSlide: Chaining?
[20:29] CoverSlide: (function($){$.get()})(app)
[20:30] joshkehn: Meh.
[20:30] tjholowaychuk: you could do app\n\n.get()\n\n.get() etc
[20:30] tjholowaychuk: but yeah, dont do that
[20:30] joshkehn: Still more characters then app.get
[20:30] Sorella: var get = app.get, post = app.post, ...
[20:31] ydef: sorella -- yeah, for everything in exports
[20:31] Raynos: tbranyen you get shot for recommending with
[20:31] Sorella: or... wait, I guess you need to call it in the right object? Not familiar with express.
[20:31] Draggor: I take it with is not like a let in lisp
[20:31] tbranyen: Raynos: sorry i'm not scared of language concepts :)
[20:31] CoverSlide: var get = app.get.binf(app)

[20:31] Sorella: Draggor, no.
[20:32] Draggor: That's unfortunate
[20:32] tbranyen: its like saying its too confusing to put () on the outside of (function() { }) instead of (function(){}());
[20:32] Raynos: tbranyen: never use ==
[20:32] Raynos: Seriously. Dont do it
[20:32] CoverSlide: some weird people like to use void function(){}
[20:32] tbranyen: Raynos: sounds like you've been brainwashed and don't know why :-p
[20:32] Raynos: I do know why
[20:32] CoverSlide: `void function(){}()`
[20:32] Raynos: I hate type coercion
[20:32] tbranyen: there are perfectly valid reasons to use ==
[20:32] Raynos: In the browser yes
[20:33] Raynos: in node, no

[20:33] hydrozen has joined the channel
[20:33] Raynos: with is bad for readability, end of. It's also murders the JIT
[20:33] tbranyen: (obj == null) will test for undefined/null, (typeof obj == "whatever")
[20:33] tbranyen: in both cases
[20:33] Raynos: joshkehn: I dont know all the rules of by heart
[20:33] tbranyen: == is fine
[20:33] tbranyen: typeof will ALWAYS return a string
[20:33] tbranyen: it can't not
[20:33] CoverSlide: == is fine if you do want to catch all falsy values
[20:33] Sorella: type coercion is awesome. It's also faster than === for objects of same type, according to jsperf.
[20:33] ydef: heh ... so you could write a little utility function, abusing eval, to accomplish var n = require(thing)[n] for all of exports. 
[20:33] tbranyen: speed is a non concern to me
[20:33] Raynos: tbranyen: but why not use === in the latter case?
[20:34] joshkehn: Sorella: On which JS engines?
[20:34] tjholowaychuk: tbranyen haha yeah i always laugh a little when i see typeof + ===
[20:34] Raynos: === is slightly faster, its more readable, its less ambigious
[20:34] joshkehn: tbranyen: Speed is always a concern.
[20:34] Sorella: joshkehn, dunno, it was posted on ##javascript a while ago. I think v8 or SM
[20:34] tbranyen: lol
[20:34] Sorella: but meh, microoptimisations.
[20:34] tbranyen: yes i am going to care about == over ===
[20:34] tbranyen: i have no life
[20:34] xiagox has joined the channel
[20:34] joshkehn: If I'm comparing to something I will use ===, even with typeof
[20:34] joshkehn: If I'm checking truth I'll use if (foo) and if (!foo)
[20:35] Raynos: I just dont see a reason to prefer ==
[20:35] tbranyen: thats fine, its just dumb to tell other people to not do what youre insecure about
[20:35] tbranyen: you sound like crockford :-p
[20:35] joshkehn: If I'm coding with others I'll be explicit on truth if (typeof foo === 'undefined' || foo === null) 
[20:35] Sorella: If I'm comparing values, I'll use ==. If I'm comparing data structures, I'll use ===. Everyone wins that way.
[20:35] tbranyen: joshkehn: thats excessive
[20:35] tbranyen: and unecessary
[20:35] joshkehn: tbranyen: Sure is!
[20:35] Sorella: foo == null
[20:35] tjholowaychuk: [] == false and !![] == true ftw
[20:35] Raynos: I agree that == null is the only exception
[20:35] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: ha i love that one
[20:35] Sorella: no need for typeof if you know the variable exists.
[20:36] Raynos: But you should avoid allowing input that can be both null & undefined
[20:36] Raynos: that's just bad API design
[20:36] joshkehn: But when you're writing code that is being read by other people who have no clue what is true or false it makes sense to be as verbose as possible.
[20:36] Sorella: Raynos, well, blame it on the guys who wrote ECMAScript specs.
[20:36] Raynos: eich: why do you do this?
[20:36] Sorella: there was no need for both null and undefined in the first place.
[20:36] Sorella: just nil would be fine.

[20:40] Sorella: like coercing a function declaration to function expression, so you can call it.
[20:40] CoverSlide: <a href="javascript:void(SOMEFUNCTION())">Click</a> <-- use for void

[20:40] Raynos: joshkehn: do you think JS was not written in 3 weeks?
[20:40] joshkehn: Sorry about that. Machine kernal panic'ed
[20:40] Sorella: CoverSlide, javascript:SOMEFUNCTION(),0
[20:41] Sorella: optimised!
[20:41] CoverSlide: yay!
[20:41] Sorella: I'm not sure 0 works though.
[20:41] joshkehn: I know it was written in 3 weeks. I'm saying what was the purpose of including it.
[20:41] TheJH: Sorella, how about !1 ?
[20:41] Raynos: Some other language has a void operator?
[20:41] Sorella: Raynos, C
[20:41] CoverSlide: Java
[20:41] joshkehn: “What does void do in JavaScript?”
[20:41] joshkehn: Better question.
[20:42] Sorella: joshkehn, evaluates an expression, then returns undefined.
[20:42] CoverSlide: evaluates to undefined
[20:42] Sorella: so, void ::= "void" <expression> → undefined

[20:50] Insekticid: DrMcKay: yap
[20:50] DrMcKay: so, we have a node.php

[20:50] DrMcKay: some weird ass port to Rhino
[20:50] Insekticid: DrMcKay: Node ported to Ruby

[20:51] joshkehn: https://github.com/davidcoallier/node-php
[20:51] Sorella: The world is really beyond salvation =/
[20:51] DrMcKay: Sorella: because of bnoordhuis 
[20:51] joshkehn: “Be worried, be very worried. The name NodePHP takes its name from the fact that we are effectively turning a nice Node.js server into a FastCGI interface that interacts with PHP-FPM.”
[20:51] joshkehn: “Yes this goes against all ideas and concepts of Node.js”
[20:51] DrMcKay: I meant: https://github.com/bnoordhuis/phode
[20:51] bnoordhuis: we renamed it :)
[20:51] bnoordhuis: node.php is too much typing
[20:52] Insekticid: DrMcKay: I just saw Noderb on my friend's twitter. He is the creator :-) I mean, I like the idea :-)
[20:52] DrMcKay: bnoordhuis: it's still PHP, you won't hide it.

[20:52] tbranyen: node.net
[20:52] DrMcKay: Insekticid: I'll check it out later :)
[20:52] bnoordhuis: joshkehn: a gyp file
[20:52] bnoordhuis: joshkehn: before you ask, gyp is a build system :)

[20:52] DrMcKay: I will make one!

[20:52] joshkehn: bnoordhuis: …. Okay.
[20:53] DrMcKay: no, there is something like that

[21:21] CoverSlide: i love it when you hit those switches
[21:21] bnoordhuis: tmedema: no idea, the closest thing is --prof
[21:21] CoverSlide: a curveball is what my pitch is
[21:21] upstream has left the channel
[21:22] Sorella: dilvie, true, but not as low level as for/while. Plus they're easier to read and don't need break/continue statements :3
[21:22] tmedema: bnoordhuis: hmm right. Did you play around with node inspector? It does seem to need such flag in order to make the console work as mine doesn't. I got the flags from http://howtonode.org/debugging-with-node-inspector and they're not inspector flags either
[21:23] dilvie: true, but I rarely used break/continue statements anyway. IMO, you can usually do better by filtering the list before you get to the point where you might want to use break/continue.
[21:23] dilvie: and what do you know, one of those functional dealies is .filter()
[21:24] bnoordhuis: tmedema: maybe that blog post is outdated - node has --debug-break, maybe it was called --start-brk in older versions
[21:24] bnoordhuis: but don't quote me on that
[21:24] tmedema: bnoordhuis: sure, but I doubt the flags have been removed 
[21:25] tmedema: I cannot even find --debug-break though when I do a node --help
[21:26] bnoordhuis: tmedema: it's what gets called when you run `node debug script.js`
[21:26] bnoordhuis: s/called/passed to child process/
[21:27] tmedema: bnoordhuis: yeah, I am running it like that. Shame the node inspector console does not work.
[21:27] tmedema: Likely is related to the missing --fwd-io flag

[21:34] Sorella: there are only a handful of proposals that are actually worth having. Like let, yield and the destructuring assignment.
[21:35] Sorella: but those are already in JS 1.7 (or was it 1.8?)
[21:35] ydef: let especially

[21:38] Raynos: The only thing I dont want is `class`
[21:38] Sorella: because, really, who thought var x = `x$foo` would be a good addition?
[21:38] joshkehn: Class is pointless
[21:38] ydef: ah, tail call ... hmmm. okay, tail call, destructuring, and let.
[21:38] joshkehn: There shouldn't be classes.
[21:38] joshkehn: If you want classes use one of the existing patterns the pretend to be classes.

[21:39] Raynos: Agreed
[21:39] Sorella: joshkehn, they are still pointless if you do that :3
[21:39] ydef: yeah, especially preprocessor stuff like quasiquote. man, you could implement that on top of burrito; it doesn't need to be in the language.
[21:39] Raynos: baking classes into the language is going to lead to annoying conversations like "But its in the language, please use _this_ oo structure in your code"
[21:39] tjholowaychuk: accessors should go too
[21:39] Sorella: short function syntax would be nice to have.
[21:39] joshkehn: They are pointless but they don't mess with everyone else who doesn't want that cruft
[21:39] Raynos: #() { } please

[21:40] joshkehn: You're more then welcome to as long as you don't impair the core language.
[21:40] Sorella: Raynos, I proposed using the lambda symbol, but Eich said valid identifiers and unicode was out.
[21:40] joshkehn: Gotta run, I'll be on later.
[21:40] Raynos: Sorella: thats a pain to type
[21:40] Raynos: What I need is a better bind
[21:41] DrMcKay: make it COBOL!
[21:41] ydef: Draggor: yeah, macros. Maybe I'm confusing them with quasiquote, but what would they be used for?

[21:41] ydef: I don't see what besides macros u use quasiq for
[21:41] Draggor: ydef: same way I use them in lisp, where functions just don't quite cut it, and where a small little DSL is nice.

[21:42] ydef: Draggor -- absolutely. And it's awesome. But it doesn't need to be in the language, because it can be implemented via Burrito or some other code-walking preprocesser

[22:25] tbranyen: ACTION waits till he gets kicked for self promotion
[22:25] cconstantine_: skython, express appears to be the popular framework.  I have no idea how good/better the other templating engines are
[22:25] Daegalus: tbranyen: its a CSS templating, along with Jade which is HTML templating, combine the 2 and you got an all around templater
[22:26] Raynos: skython: express
[22:26] `3rdEden: Stylus is not a template language its a css pre-processor not css templating
[22:27] skython: what about this 'geddy' framework ? should be pylons like but i haven't seen many commits there over the last months
[22:27] Daegalus: to me its kind of the same. Jade Template -> Compiled to HTML, Stylus Template -> Compiled to CSS. For this specific context I treat it black and white
[22:29] Raynos: skython: Its not being actively worked on.

[22:33] context: it doesn't replace 'A' if you dont want it to
[22:33] skython: Jade looks funny but it makes sense, i'm often too lazy to write all this xml-like html stuff and close all the tags. looks like a very good solution to that problem ^^
[22:33] amid_hasan: Nuck: I have hosting through godaddy, you think I can install node there?

[22:33] Daegalus: Nuck: I still dont see how Stylus is that much different from Jade. Im looking at examples and such right now> its even setup in a similar style/syntax
[22:33] Raynos: Ew apache in front of node
[22:34] Raynos: dont do it
[22:34] Nuck: I agree with raydeo
[22:34] tjholowaychuk: Daegalus yeah i agree
[22:34] Nuck: Errr Raynos
[22:34] amid_hasan: am i missing something, but is nosql relational?
[22:34] tjholowaychuk: CS is basically just a glorified template engine too, in a sense, but i guess they should all be just called compilers not template engines

[22:36] Sorella: Yeah, template engines are something you insert inside another language, and it doesn't care about the surrounding language. Or at least, that's how I see them.
[22:36] Nuck: But instead of SQL, it's a JSON object to query with
[22:36] Daegalus: tjholowaychuk:  Though, Stylus looks great. I was wondering how I would do the CSS with my Jade Templates, but now that I found stylus, I'll just generate it just like I do the Jade templates.

[22:59] AvianFlu: it should be streams and not a passed callback like that
[22:59] Nuck: Make it based on Connect :D
[22:59] Nuck: ACTION <3 Connect
[22:59] jesusabdullah: Connect has some Actual Problems, though
[22:59] hybsch has joined the channel
[22:59] joshkehn has joined the channel
[22:59] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Like?
[22:59] jesusabdullah: Like, I'm not dissing connect
[23:00] jesusabdullah: and honestly, I don't follow connect that closely, so you'd have to ask someone else
[23:00] Nuck: Yeah, that is a problem
[23:00] Nuck: That you're not dissing it
[23:00] jesusabdullah: but I *do* know that there are specific examples
[23:00] tjholowaychuk: :s
[23:00] tjholowaychuk: that's very vague lol
[23:00] jesusabdullah: Well yeah, i don't remember anything else
[23:00] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: That's what I was thinking
[23:01] Nuck: With something as widely-used as Connect, I'd imagine the bugs will be worked out in record time
[23:01] DTrejo has joined the channel
[23:01] jesusabdullah: Like I said, I think connect is pretty nice
[23:01] Nuck: And tj's OCD will kick in.
[23:01] Nuck: And he'll probably fix it so everything is perfect
[23:01] tjholowaychuk: the main issue is that people next() when they shouldn't because they dont know what they're doing
[23:01] tjholowaychuk: that's the #1 issue
[23:01] AvianFlu: +10
[23:01] jesusabdullah: Nuck: It's not bugs, it's patterns that introduce limitations, and finding that given what we know now we can make a nicer interface
[23:02] AvianFlu: that style doesn't play that nice with streams, is the only thing I'd say
[23:02] roidrage has joined the channel

[23:02] Nuck: Use promises :P
[23:02] Nuck: lol
[23:02] tjholowaychuk: though that's more an issue of node not having a core way to define "filters" etc
[23:03] jesusabdullah: Well like I was kinda trying to get at, I don't dislike express or connect, I think they're solid, useful pieces of software
[23:03] tjholowaychuk: and not much to do with connect

[23:04] bnoordhuis: that takes care of the plumbing?
[23:04] Nuck: bnoordhuis: Huh?
[23:05] Nuck: require('streams')
[23:05] Nuck: It's done
[23:05] jesusabdullah: Nuck: Why don't you build it?
[23:05] bnoordhuis: Nuck: streams.Stream does next to nothing

[23:09] abcdxyz: v8 does not say shit
[23:09] Nuck: "undefined_fkin_object"

[23:10] abcdxyz: the ting is that is undefined, and v8 does not say sg like "hey man you didnt even defined that object" it just returns from the function and nish nil nada
[23:10] Nuck: Oh god from streetspeak to irish
[23:10] abcdxyz: :S
[23:10] _sorensen_: i know of /prog, jsut never heard world4ch term before
[23:10] Sorella: sleepsort was suggested there, though, iirc.
[23:10] _sorensen_: saw that 
[23:10] Sorella: oh
[23:10] AvianFlu: abcdxyz: First advice: ignore Nuck.
[23:10] _sorensen_: sleep sort was a fun thread
[23:10] Sorella: well, I don't know much about world4ch either :3

[23:11] abcdxyz: yes

[23:16] slickplaid: step one: put quotes around the keys. step two: ... step three: profit.
[23:16] Nexxy: amid_hasan, http://www.json.org/ is a good start
[23:16] Sorella: The specs are fairly straightforward and easy to follow.
[23:16] Daegalus: I persoanlly want XML to die, I will give it a nice memorial service, but it needs to die
[23:16] Nuck: Nexxy: I assumed we were misunderstanding him.  Turned out I was right

[23:17] AvianFlu: Nuck is about the trolliest we have... and that's really not doing so badly
[23:17] Nuck: abcdxyz: But yeah, json-san's github repo is pretty simple.
[23:17] amid_hasan: Sorella: after reading specs, i'd love to see code samples of how jSon is applied to web services. any ideas where to look for code?
[23:17] Nuck: Err
[23:17] AvianFlu: we could have 40 of him
[23:17] Nuck: Sorry, trains collided
[23:17] Nexxy: like #ruby
[23:17] No9: www.jsonviewer.com is handy too when it goes breasts up
[23:17] AvianFlu: Nexxy, yes.
[23:17] Sorella: amid_hasan, there's no code. JSON is a markup-language, not a programming language.
[23:17] abcdxyz: Nexxy :-D he seems entertaining though
[23:17] Nexxy: abcdxyz, give it a few weeks.
[23:17] Sorella: similar to XML, YAML, CSV and such.

[23:18] Nuck: abcdxyz: Nexxy has a severe distaste for me.
[23:18] Nuck: She's a humorless annoyance.
[23:18] Nexxy: don't flatter yourself
[23:18] Daegalus: locks: i know, i just hate it, its overly complex for no reason. At my internship I had to implement XML Entity Expansion protections so if someone every managed to hack into the servers, they couldnt' launch a billion laughs attack. You cant really do that with json
[23:18] abcdxyz: You can program FPGAs and embedded devices in JSON but that's an EASTER EGG
[23:18] abcdxyz: :-D
[23:18] locks: I've had my fair share of XML nightmare
[23:18] Nexxy: I barely tolerate you out of hopes that you will get your head out of your ass at some point and start being a productive member of the community :)
[23:18] locks: like, WSDL SOAP *gag*
[23:18] AvianFlu: it's pretty funny that I just saw Nuck call somebody else a humorless annoyance. XD
[23:18] Nexxy: instead of mocking everyone at every turn
[23:18] Nuck: https://github.com/jesusabdullah/json-san down at Examples
[23:19] AvianFlu: that, however, is a great lib to learn JSON with
[23:19] Nuck: Nexxy: Well, I've yet to see you contribute a single module
[23:19] AvianFlu: so Nuck++ in this case
[23:19] Nuck: AvianFlu: They asked about json-san
[23:19] AvianFlu: Nuck++
[23:19] v8bot_:  AvianFlu has given a beer to Nuck. Nuck now has 2 beers.
[23:19] No9: Its a matter of perspective SOAP was a shite load better than DCOM over http 
[23:19] Nuck: So I gave them JSON-san
[23:19] Nexxy: I'm talking specifically about your conduct in #node.js 
[23:19] Nuck: Am I the *only* person who realized they were asking about JSON-San specifically?
[23:19] Nexxy: I have no doubts that you're good @ programming
[23:19] Sorella: http://chocolatapp.com/blog/self-ml Is more interesting than XML, but lacks a JS implementation =/
[23:19] jerrysv: amid_hasan: most api's i've seen recently have offered responses in both XML and JSON
[23:19] Nexxy: you're just decidedly bad at interacting with people
[23:20] jerrysv: amid_hasan: if you want specifics, just ask
[23:20] amid_hasan: jerrysv: thank you.

[23:36] kiffness has joined the channel
[23:36] abcdxyz: chapel You wanna get ontopic? :-D Every used the Step flow control lib?
[23:36] carlocci: as soon as the line expands to the new line, backspace moves the cursor to  the bottom right and the line is repeated every keypress
[23:36] carlocci: what did I write??
[23:36] abcdxyz: *ever
[23:36] jokil: I see that node has a 'vm' feature that allows you to run sandboxed code (http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.6/api/all.html#executing_JavaScript). Does this also prevent access to OS APIs like 'fs' and 'child_process' ?
[23:36] chapel: abcdxyz: not personally, but Ive heard good things, Ive used async and seq
[23:37] chapel: jokil: it only allows what you pass into it, otherwise it is sandboxed
[23:37] abcdxyz: chapel cause it swallows all exceptions. is that normal?
[23:37] abcdxyz: chapel documentation is a bit sparse tbh
[23:37] abcdxyz: chapel anyway forget it im gonna check the source
[23:37] carlocci: as soon as the line is long enough to start a new line, backspace does that
[23:37] chapel: abcdxyz: you can pass exceptions if you want
[23:37] chapel: standard is err, res
[23:37] chapel: error being the first
[23:38] chapel: other flow control libraries have an error catchall usually at the end of the flow
[23:38] abcdxyz: i see
[23:38] carlocci: I really think it's readline's fault, as starting the repl with NODE_NO_READLINE works
[23:38] abcdxyz: ty

[23:44] TooTallNate: Prisons are designed to keep dangerous criminals. Sandboxes are for children to not get lost or hurt while playing. There are several ways to break out of the sandbox... DON'T!

[23:45] jokil: bnoordhuis TooTallNate: Are you familiar with this? Is it a better abstraction? https://github.com/gf3/sandbox
[23:45] carlocci: well, if anyone've ever had problems with readline repeating the input when pressing backspace when the input is more than a line long, let me know
[23:45] brianseeders has joined the channel
[23:45] TooTallNate: carlocci: I know what you're talking about
[23:45] TooTallNate: I've experienced it
[23:45] kmiyashiro: I thought sandboxes were to keep the sand in.

[23:46] TooTallNate: what are you trying to sandbox?
[23:46] carlocci: TooTallNate: if you were able to solve it, do you have any hint?
[23:46] Sorella: carlocci, happens here as well. Not sure what the problem is though.
[23:47] TooTallNate: jokil: that module fires up a node child process, so it safer in that regard
[23:47] TooTallNate: it's also async, so if you needed sync then there's that
[23:47] TooTallNate: carlocci: never fixed it, just live with it
[23:47] jokil: TooTallNate: basically I'm trying to make a node.js developer challenge. I select set of modules are provided and contestants write code that uses these modules to solve the challenge.
[23:47] TooTallNate: jokil: you probably want a module like the one you linked
[23:48] carlocci: Sorella: it drives me mad. To the point I have to use ecmabot when fiddling withoneliners
[23:48] TooTallNate: running untrused code, I think the `vm` module is unsatisfactory
[23:48] TooTallNate: carlocci: you can use rlwrap
[23:48] TooTallNate: with NODE_NO_READLINE
[23:48] TooTallNate: worked nicely last I remember
[23:48] TooTallNate: but I don't use it
[23:48] carlocci: I think it's due to some mismatch in the line length as perceived by readline (just like when you use unwrapped color codes in your prompt)
[23:49] carlocci: TooTallNate: I might as well try that; it's even in the repo
[23:50] carlocci: or, maybe try to fix the bug
[23:50] Malar has joined the channel
[23:51] TooTallNate: carlocci: fixing it would be ideal, that way people like me who don't do rlwrap will be saved :D
[23:51] TooTallNate: carlocci: another part about rlwrap though is that it keeps your history
[23:52] TooTallNate: through subsequent processes
