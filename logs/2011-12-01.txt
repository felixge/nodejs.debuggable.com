[00:09] ircdearia has joined the channel
[00:09] robertj: brianc1, but you gotta have some way to abort the context
[00:09] brianc1: robertj: good point. 
[00:09] robertj: brianc1, plus you got memory leaking issues
[00:10] robertj: and not even leaking issues, you got just memory rationing
[00:10] cjm has joined the channel
[00:10] robertj: I tried giving it a proxy as a context to try to compute the memory requirement objects put in the context's global scope even...

[00:52] isaacs: which is unfortnuate.
[00:52] seebees: that's about it.  I'll poke around...
[00:52] isaacs: gotta figure that one out.
[00:53] isaacs: also, the msi needs to set up prefix = %APPDATA%\npm and add %APPDATA\npm to the %Path%
[00:54] joshsmith: anyone know when Mongoose is going to add in insertAll?
[00:55] seebees: you're moving "Program Files\node_modules" to %APPDATA%
[00:55] seebees: or just npm?
[00:55] aioue has joined the channel
[00:56] isaacs: seebees: npm itself will still live there, with node.
[00:56] isaacs: seebees: but, the global installs that npm installs will go into %APPDATA%
[00:56] isaacs: that is, into %APPDATA%\npm\node_modules\blah
[00:56] isaacs: and i think we can make `npm link` work on windows soonish, maybe
[00:57] isaacs: probably not in xp, though
[00:57] seebees: hum.  junctions?
[00:57] seebees: they should work
[00:58] mmalecki: on windows should has extremely low value
[00:59] mikeric has joined the channel
[00:59] isaacs: seebees: they totally should work.

[01:00] nex3: How does one debug a stack overflow in node?

[01:00] chjj: nex3: you look for the recursive function that is going haywire
[01:01] mmalecki: isaacs: welcome to Windows. enjoy your stay. in case of problems, please consult Ctrl+Alt+Del.
[01:01] nex3: I'd really like a backtrace so I'd know where to start looking

[01:03] AvianFlu: mmalecki, in case of problems, please consult your nearest linux distro install disc
[01:03] mmalecki: AvianFlu++
[01:03] v8bot_:  mmalecki has given a beer to AvianFlu. AvianFlu now has 1 beers.
[01:03] isaacs: seebees: well, you can't create junctions to files, the paths need ot be absolute, and there are slightly different semantics around creating and deleting them
[01:04] aioue has joined the channel
[01:04] mmalecki: I actually ditched discs quite a long time ago
[01:04] mmalecki: usb boot ftw
[01:04] mmalecki: I still have no idea how to do full network install tho
[01:05] AvianFlu: tftp is a bitch
[01:05] seebees: isaacs: that is all true.  I suppose I was thinking that for simple cases it should just work.
[01:07] mmalecki: AvianFlu: yeah, it is. there's no easy solution for this, unfortunately
[01:07] mmalecki: so I guess Linux isn't enterprise-ready

[01:08] nicholasf has joined the channel
[01:08] AvianFlu: or did you see a segfault
[01:08] nex3: AvianFlu: neither, it just said "Stack Overflow"
[01:08] nex3: I'll gist the entire output
[01:08] CoverSlide: wow
[01:08] CoverSlide: that's a new one
[01:08] nex3: [https://gist.github.com/1412449
[01:08] seebees: isaacs: "There is a limit of 31 reparse points on any given path."  you win… again.
[01:09] Dmitrijus: nex3: well, enable teh core dumps, wait for it, gdb it!
[01:09] AvianFlu: nex3: it looks like somebody wrote `throw 'Stack Overflow'`
[01:10] AvianFlu: which is just lulz
[01:10] rwasielewski has joined the channel
[01:10] AvianFlu: but yeah, that's new to me too
[01:10] chjj: nex3: stack overflows dont usually look like that in node, you wouldnt get the throw e; junk at the top
[01:10] chjj: and it wouldnt say stack overflow
[01:10] deadmau5: fuck i hate when people throw strings
[01:10] deadmau5: or callback(string)
[01:10] AvianFlu: yeah
[01:11] mmalecki: ahahahaha
[01:11] AvianFlu: I had a lib that I forked because every error was either callback(data) or callback(err)
[01:11] nex3: Ah, I see... we are wrapping exceptions in a potentially weird way
[01:11] AvianFlu: so you'd have to check every object afterwards to see what it was
[01:11] deadmau5: i see that soooo often
[01:11] deadmau5: unfortunately
[01:11] caolanm has joined the channel

[01:12] AvianFlu: chjj: YEAH.
[01:12] chjj: that would drive me insane
[01:12] deadmau5: ahahaha
[01:12] deadmau5: do it
[01:12] deadmau5: all over core
[01:12] AvianFlu: yeah, I was waiting on some other small pull request for two weeks
[01:12] deadmau5: no descriptive error message either
[01:12] AvianFlu: and then one day I just stopped and re-wrote every callback in 600 lines of code
[01:12] deadmau5: just stack overflow for everything
[01:13] bradleyg has joined the channel
[01:13] mmalecki: also, make it happen after some random interval
[01:14] deadmau5: yeah
[01:14] deadmau5: and write it with that weird []+whatever hack
[01:14] matin has joined the channel
[01:14] deadmau5: so you can never find it
[01:14] mmalecki: oh yes
[01:14] matin has left the channel
[01:14] mmalecki: that would make me a very bad human being, right?
[01:15] jesusabdullah: Not sure
[01:15] AvianFlu: that would make a funny troll pull request... "Error messages too descriptive, too friendly to beginners.'
[01:15] mmalecki: lol
[01:15] deadmau5: make them work for it
[01:15] nex3: Okay, so, I've got the actual exception object
[01:15] stantona has joined the channel
[01:15] nex3: But it still has no stack information attached to it
[01:15] AvianFlu: nex3: gist it
[01:16] deadmau5: :s
[01:16] deadmau5: maybe some failed attempt to inherit from Error
[01:16] nex3: https://gist.github.com/1412449
[01:16] AvianFlu: OKAY. that makes sense.
[01:16] chjj: okay, so someone was wrapping that error?
[01:16] AvianFlu: something, somewhere, is recursing in an infinite loop
[01:16] mmalecki: ok, now I'm gonna write my first line of coffeescript in my entire life
[01:17] jesusabdullah: Godspeed, sir
[01:17] jesusabdullah: I wrote cs once
[01:17] chjj: nex3: this should be easy, search for the code that wraps that error
[01:17] AvianFlu: nex3: try to find recursion and throw the recursive call into a process.nextTick()
[01:17] jerrysv: mmalecki: sucker
[01:17] jesusabdullah: but then I learned js better and now I, well
[01:17] jesusabdullah: I'm happy with what I got
[01:17] mmalecki: I need it for forever testing :(
[01:17] mmalecki: actually, I need any command
[01:17] deadmau5: i LOVE adding separate coffeescript support

[01:18] marcello3d: weeee
[01:18] jerrysv: i bought a book on it, during an agile week sale for pragprog, still haven't read it
[01:19] chjj: a book on what?
[01:19] jesusabdullah: Why were you thinking of writing cs?
[01:19] deadmau5: the best is
[01:19] deadmau5: http://cl.ly/CEGy
[01:19] jesusabdullah: cs support for a project?
[01:19] deadmau5: that's because, it's not a language
[01:19] deadmau5: it's a parser
[01:19] chjj: ...theres books on coffeescript? ...

[01:21] pksunkara: which is the best mock?

[01:21] chjj: "CoffeeScript is JavaScript done right."
[01:21] chjj: hahahahahahahahahhaha
[01:21] jerrysv: chjj: having watched a friend write a book for pragprog, that's a hellofa lot of work to "cash out"
[01:21] jerrysv: pksunkara: what are you mocking?
[01:22] pksunkara: github api
[01:22] pksunkara: github.com/pkumar/octonode
[01:23] nex3: So I'm still in the position where I have this exception object that has no stack information
[01:23] jesusabdullah: s/right/like ruby/
[01:23] jesusabdullah: which is fine, but we should call it what it is
[01:23] nex3: Whether or not that exception is wrapped
[01:23] jerrysv: nex3: when i force a stack overflow, that's not even the error i'm getting
[01:24] pksunkara: I don't know, I like coffeescript just cuz it redcues the code I have to write
[01:24] pksunkara: I convert it into js before publishing
[01:24] nex3: jerrysv: you're not getting RangeError?
[01:24] deadmau5: and increases what you have to debug
[01:24] jerrysv: nex3: so, that error could be coming from the OS - maybe compile in debug mode and run inside of gdb
[01:24] chjj: i think someone is messing with nex3's code to try to make him slowly go insane or something
[01:24] deadmau5: who writes code
[01:24] nex3: It's not impossible
[01:24] deadmau5: automate that shit
[01:24] jerrysv: nex3: yes, getting range error, not the other gist you posted though
[01:25] nex3: yeah, that was weird wrapping
[01:25] nex3: But getting rid of it still doesn't get me a stack
[01:25] jerrysv: nex3: RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded 
[01:25] marcello3d: github.com/pkumar/octonode: the c-style method names are very un-javascript
[01:25] nex3: jerrysv: yes, that's what I'm getting now

[01:26] kiilo has joined the channel
[01:26] marcello3d: just saying :)
[01:26] jesusabdullah: pksunkara: octonode should use camelCase methods
[01:26] jesusabdullah: pksunkara: cause camelCase rocks
[01:26] pksunkara: jesusabdullah: definitely
[01:26] chjj: no it doesnt
[01:26] chjj: i hate camelcase
[01:26] marcello3d: it's not a matter of rocking
[01:26] pksunkara: camelCase ++
[01:27] marcello3d: it's a matter of consistency
[01:27] chjj: camelcase is such a failure i refuse to type it in camelcase
[01:27] jesusabdullah: Yeah, it's the consistency really
[01:27] jesusabdullah: in python i_use_undascores
[01:27] chjj: yeah, i use it, but i dont like it

[01:27] CrabDude has joined the channel
[01:27] pksunkara: let's talk about what mocking framework should I use?
[01:27] chjj: :(
[01:27] jesusabdullah: hehe
[01:27] pksunkara: I haven't got an answer yet
[01:27] marcello3d: someone should write a javascript preparser that replaces camelcase with underscores
[01:27] chjj: i would prefer lowercase + underscores
[01:27] marcello3d: call it java_script
[01:27] jesusabdullah: pksunkara: nock sounded nice, but you should camelcase those methods first
[01:28] chjj: javascript is just a bad name all around
[01:28] marcello3d: and the commandline would be j_s
[01:28] chjj: and ecmascript is worse
[01:28] pksunkara: jesusabdullah: those are not even written yet, they are a todo list
[01:28] chjj: i vote we just call it "js"
[01:28] jesusabdullah: ah
[01:28] jesusabdullah: in that case
[01:28] chjj: the j and the s dont stand for anything
[01:28] jesusabdullah: DONT FORGET
[01:28] pksunkara: jesusabdullah: copied from someone else's abandoned project
[01:28] jesusabdullah: oh, I see
[01:28] jesusabdullah: YOU ARE FORGIVEN
[01:28] jocafa: except that all of the standard interfaces in js are camel case
[01:29] chjj: i want to fork v8 and make that not the case ^
[01:29] pksunkara: jesusabdullah: If you want to see the functions until now, see the "usage" seciton
[01:29] jocafa: parseInt, toString...
[01:29] chjj: get it? "not the case"? get it?
[01:29] jocafa: lawls
[01:31] pksunkara: marcello3d: what use would j_s be?
[01:31] marcello3d: so chjj doesn't have to use camelCase
[01:31] pksunkara: lol
[01:31] marcello3d: we could also replace . with ->
[01:31] marcello3d: and require $ in front of variable names
[01:31] deadmau5:  and \
[01:32] deadmau5:  Awesome\Namespacing\FTW
[01:32] pksunkara: I think the name should be php instead of j_s

[01:45] tonymilne: Ok, well basically i have node-http-proxy that will balance between multiple app servers (on different VPS), i will have something that posts a request (basically a remote command) to it, and i want each of the app servers to know about the request, so that they can all respond accordingly. Any ideas on this deadmau5?
[01:45] marcello3d: what's devop?
[01:46] jocafa: could someone write a badass operational transformation library that works on arbitrary objects for me so i don't have to?
[01:46] deadmau5: tonymilne you wouldnt use message passing for that
[01:46] deadmau5: not really suited for streaming requests
[01:46] deadmau5: that's what a load balancer is for
[01:46] pksunkara: Are there any nodejs conferences in India?
[01:46] sente: marcello3d: half developer half sys-admin
[01:46] marcello3d: ah
[01:47] tonymilne: deadmau5 how so? I feel like i need to do it the way i described, unless you can explain why - otherwise?
[01:47] deadmau5: you could hack it together im sure but messaging is not really designed for that
[01:48] deadmau5: that's what streaming is for
[01:48] deadmau5: streaming things
[01:48] chjj: streaming is webscale
[01:48] chjj: lots of webscale
[01:48] tonymilne: i can't stream from the 3rd party that makes the request into my stack.
[01:48] tonymilne: thats some Java app ;)
[01:48] tonymilne: i have load balanced app + socket.io servers using a load balancer  + cluster.
[01:49] tonymilne: i need all of them to act upon the incoming request from said 3rd party,
[01:49] tonymilne: by pushing to their connected sockets, etc.

[01:50] tonymilne: I'm thinking i can use redis store for socket.io , but i still feel like the app instances will need to all know that the 3rd party has made a request.
[01:50] jocafa: java is a 4-letter-word
[01:51] deadmau5: your network design should be pretty opaque
[01:51] deadmau5: so
[01:51] ryan_stevens: tonymline: https://github.com/dshaw/socket.io-redis is a good project for that
[01:51] deadmau5: either you need some nodes to get that data
[01:51] deadmau5: or you dont
[01:51] ryan_stevens: uses redis as a bus to pub to all node instances listening 
[01:51] deadmau5: and if you do, then proxy to them or whatever
[01:51] Samuel_Roldan: Hi everyone, I am trying to run a jellyfish script and the following error occurs. (I wonder if it is related to some missing module)
[01:51] Samuel_Roldan: node.js:201
[01:51] Samuel_Roldan:         throw e; // process.nextTick error, or 'error' event on first tick
[01:51] Samuel_Roldan:               ^
[01:51] Samuel_Roldan: Error: Cannot find module '../../build/default/window_context'
[01:51] deadmau5: still you dont pub a whole request
[01:51] tonymilne: no, 
[01:51] deadmau5: massive uploads n shit
[01:51] tonymilne: im not pubbing a request!
[01:51] tonymilne: lol.
[01:51] deadmau5: oh
[01:51] deadmau5: well fuck
[01:51] deadmau5: haha
[01:52] deadmau5: say that
[01:52] tonymilne: I'm pebbling what the request is essentially telling my stack
[01:52] tonymilne: imaging this.
[01:52] TN has joined the channel
[01:52] tonymilne: 3rd party tells me its now 4th period
[01:52] tonymilne: i tell all connected socket.io clients, its now 4th period (…)
[01:52] tonymilne: and some logic, etc.
[01:52] devongovett has joined the channel
[01:52] tonymilne: or i get my apps to re-load the data from mongoose, after the receiving app updated my model/document.
[01:53] Samuel_Roldan: does this ring a bell to anyone: Error: Cannot find module '../../build/default/window_context'
[01:53] tonymilne: so just pub/subbing a command to my apps, more than the request iteself.
[01:53] deadmau5: ah
[01:53] tonymilne: (it's for a sporting app)
[01:53] deadmau5: yes then zmq would be perfect
[01:53] deadmau5: for that
[01:53] tonymilne: so 3rd party tells me score event happened
[01:53] tonymilne: but it will come into my load balanced stack
[01:53] tonymilne: and i need "everyone" to know about it.
[01:54] tonymilne: kk, cool :)
[01:54] tonymilne: thanks for being a sounding board!
[01:55] tonymilne: Lastly, um, zeromq - it's just a lib, right? (no need to start it up / keep it running?)
[01:55] tonymilne: it will "just work"?
[01:55] deadmau5: just a lib
[01:55] pksunkara: When will nodejs support __noSuchMethod__ ?

[02:09] jamescarr has joined the channel

[02:13] heavysixer has joined the channel
[02:13] isaacs: JasonSmith: oh?
[02:13] JasonSmith: I used to fear and loathe semicolon insertion. Then when I joined CouchOne, mikeal said, "nah, it's never a problem"
[02:13] SubStack: and then browserling has a lot of deps too but they're spread out among several package.jsons so they're harder to count
[02:13] JasonSmith: then I noticed your code using less and less of them at all
[02:13] JasonSmith: Over about 2 years, I've moved that way
[02:13] isaacs: JasonSmith: oh, i pretty much only use semicolons where they're relevant, and in node.
[02:14] isaacs: ie, node-core
[02:14] SubStack: I like semicolons is all
[02:14] marcello3d: yea, I don't use semi colons at all
[02:14] SubStack: they fit my style pretty well
[02:14] JasonSmith: And then just today, I was reading my own code and I realized, not only does Javascript get it right when you terminate statements with newline, IT ALSO GETS IT RIGHT when you continue statements on new lines!
[02:14] benvie: there's only like one or two ways it can fuck you up and you have to already be writing your code in a weird way to trigger that
[02:14] dgathright has joined the channel
[02:14] isaacs: JasonSmith: awesome, rihgt?
[02:14] isaacs: JasonSmith: the only tricky thing is *starting* lines with ( and [
[02:14] marcello3d: I only have one place in my codebase that I need a semicolon I think
[02:15] benvie: yeah
[02:15] isaacs: JasonSmith: which is why i prefix those with ; so that they'll work whether the line above has a ; or not
[02:15] JasonSmith: oh yeah, I've been prefixing that with semicolon for a while
[02:15] JasonSmith: ; ['stuff'].forEach(...
[02:15] isaacs: right
[02:15] SubStack: I especially like trailing semicolons on their own line flush with the opening column of some complicated multi-line expression
[02:15] isaacs: that's just safer
[02:15] jacobolus has joined the channel
[02:15] benvie: starting with parens is the only place I can imagine it ever happening when you weren't doing something completely dumb
[02:15] isaacs: i'd like to start indenting with semicolons
[02:15] benvie: as there's a few places it makes sense to do that and it could end up running a function from the line before
[02:15] marcello3d: yea, it's exactly like jason's example
[02:15] briancray has joined the channel
[02:15] isaacs: also, newlines?  not safe. you can't trust newlines.  Just use semicolons until your editor word-wraps
[02:15] JasonSmith: SubStack: Well, I noticed a couple weeks ago isaacs stopped terminating his `var` stanzas and I was like, yeah that's it, I'm all in
[02:16] benvie: hahahaha
[02:16] marcello3d: I have var foo = { ... } [...].forEach
[02:16] marcello3d: basically
[02:16] SubStack: I rarely do multiple vars at once
[02:16] isaacs: "oh, mehhh, it's too much visual clutter, all those semicolons, wahhha, i like whitespace, mwehhh"
[02:16] isaacs: babies.
[02:16] benvie: yeah it starts with the var blocks, it irks you because of the asymmetry
[02:16] SubStack: and only if it fits on the same like like var x = 0, y = 0
[02:16] benvie: and then it's the one line functions
[02:16] isaacs: use semicolons, just configure your editor to not show them
[02:16] joemccann has joined the channel
[02:16] SubStack: much easier to reorganize var blocks when each line has its own var
[02:17] benvie: pretty soon you're out walking the streets doing nasty things for new lines
[02:17] JasonSmith: Also, I can finally use the conditional syntax I have been missing since Perl! https://github.com/iriscouch/erlang.js/blob/master/lib.js#L62-64
[02:17] JasonSmith: Both Ruby and Python screw up what IMO is the most aesthetic way to do that expression. (It looks LISPy)
[02:17] JasonSmith: Although I still like Python's: return foo if expression else bar;

[02:19] SubStack: because I can just require('somemodule')
[02:19] isaacs: i saw when i patched mkdirp that you use 4 space indents
[02:19] benvie: yeah I was looking for a lib to translate javascript into LOLCODE. All the implmenetations I've found go the other way and it's disappointing
[02:19] SubStack: and it works no matter how many spaces they used
[02:20] marcello3d: SubStack: nice article btw
[02:20] isaacs: SubStack: what's up with that, man?
[02:20] JasonSmith: isaacs: Yeah, recently in my code I have a "var block" with like all my imports. Then no semicolon. Then another "var block" for like actual variables
[02:20] stantona has joined the channel
[02:20] isaacs: SubStack: do we need an intervention or something?
[02:20] isaacs: 4 is too many
[02:20] maxogden: "i use three space tabs because fuck you"
[02:20] SubStack: 4 is awesome
[02:20] benvie: CAN HAZ UTIL?
[02:20] marcello3d: 4 is awesome
[02:20] SubStack: marcello3d: hahaha
[02:20] russfrank: there's nothing wrong with 4!
[02:20] russfrank: i use 3 though.
[02:20] russfrank: 2 is too little. if you use 2, you're lame
[02:20] isaacs: i used to use tabs at yahoo, and it was great.  i configured my editor to show them as 8 spaces when writing, then as 1 space when debugging
[02:20] SubStack: 3 is the compromiser
[02:20] marcello3d: especially if your ide does it for you
[02:20] asoltys has joined the channel
[02:20] benvie: I use 2 now and I'm feeling like 1 is growing on me
[02:20] isaacs: 3 is odd.
[02:21] isaacs: only odd people use it
[02:21] isaacs: indents should be multiples of 2 spaces.
[02:21] isaacs: 8, 4, 2, 1
[02:21] isaacs: 1/2
[02:21] isaacs: etc.
[02:21] benvie: binary
[02:21] SubStack: I like 4 with a hard wrap at 80 cols
[02:21] marcello3d: now you're just trolling
[02:21] SubStack: keeps me honest
[02:21] marcello3d: what about floating point tabs?
[02:21] russfrank: i'm odd? :(
[02:21] isaacs: marcello3d: srsly!
[02:21] JakeyChan has joined the channel
[02:21] marcello3d: SubStack: I'm all about the 120 cols
[02:21] russfrank: yeah I do hard wrap at 80 too, that's hot.
[02:21] maxogden: 4 space prevents you from coding like an rtard
[02:21] isaacs: marcello3d: SciTE could do it
[02:21] benvie: well like for doing var blocks, I indent the 4 spaces just so it's symmetrical
[02:21] russfrank: I'd switch to 4 but then I'd have to reindent _everything_
[02:21] benvie: I need a better solution
[02:22] josephg has joined the channel
[02:22] benvie: thinking like just var one a line by itself
[02:22] isaacs: marcello3d: you could use non-mono fonts, and so spaces were les than a standard character
[02:22] marcello3d: isaacs: coding in zapfino is really how you get down it
[02:22] robertj: is there any way to cancel a running context?
[02:22] marcello3d: *down to it
[02:22] SubStack: if you use 4 spaces at 80 cols then you pretty much have to factor everything out into reusable modules
[02:22] JasonSmith: SubStack: Yeah nice article. A small addition: Not only can you tell exactly where all those modules came from; but you can also tell exactly where your own code calls into those modules. That's crucial when refactoring or debugging
[02:22] isaacs: SubStack: that's why bmc prefers 8
[02:22] marcello3d: I mean, you really get a feel for the code
[02:22] JasonSmith: I search for "foo\." all the time in Vim
[02:22] isaacs: you basically only get 3 indents befor eyou're out of space
[02:22] marcello3d: its curves and movements
[02:23] pauls1 has joined the channel
[02:23] zachsmith: 8?! that's gross
[02:23] marcello3d: you know what's nuts
[02:23] isaacs: JasonSmith: you know, that conditional style…. you can write it something like an inline switch that way
[02:23] marcello3d: java's source code
[02:23] marcello3d: it uses 8-space tabs
[02:23] marcello3d: er
[02:23] marcello3d: it uses real tabs, as if they were 8-space
[02:23] marcello3d: but everything is 4-space indented
[02:23] marcello3d: so lines are mixed with real tabs and spaces
[02:24] JasonSmith: isaacs: you mean like chaining the "false" expression as this cascade of conditional expressions? That's awesome
[02:24] lorfds: ummm...what does this mean

[02:25] isaacs: if it's too wide for me to show two files side by side in 16pt font on my 13" macbook screen, it's too wide.
[02:25] isaacs: effectively, that's like 50-something chars
[02:25] SubStack: maxogden: they had better be dying for the right kind of whitespace then
[02:26] zachsmith: JasonSmith: We need backwards compatability with 1980's terminals
[02:26] JasonSmith: The only decent argument for 80 columns is if you do 3-way merges all day long
[02:26] JasonSmith: zachsmith: Totally!
[02:26] maxogden: SubStack: the only space they have is in their empty stomachs
[02:26] SubStack: so like
[02:26] isaacs: JasonSmith: you must have excellent vision
[02:26] isaacs: $ echo "$COLUMNS"
[02:26] isaacs: 99
[02:26] SubStack: 2 spaces?
[02:26] JasonSmith: It's okay if it's a three-way. Merge.
[02:26] russfrank: marcello3d: why would it idscourage written out variable names
[02:26] JasonSmith: It's not gay if it's in a three-way. Merge.
[02:26] marcello3d: just cause
[02:26] isaacs: oh, wait, that wasn't fs
[02:26] isaacs: $ echo "$COLUMNS"
[02:26] isaacs: 141
[02:26] russfrank: it discourages lots of indentation, but so do all of the Big Guys, if you know what I mean
[02:27] russfrank: ie those who are more experienced than me and are often right about such things
[02:27] isaacs: 80 char width is the *maximum*.  not the goal.
[02:27] JasonSmith: Linus Torvalds enforces 8 space indent (for good reason, in C), and 80 columns. Because he merges all day long.

[02:28] marcello3d: benvie: I totally don't get that java code
[02:28] SubStack: no wait, the other one
[02:28] jocafa: tabs to indent, spaces to align
[02:29] maxogden: JasonSmith: no that was true actually
[02:29] benvie: the challenge was to come up with something that java could do in less code than any other language
[02:29] maxogden: JasonSmith: but my political stance on the whitespace issue is neutral
[02:29] marcello3d: benvie: where is a value assigned to x?
[02:29] benvie: the only answer was someone outputting a java division by zero stack trace
[02:30] benvie: and even that was verbose
[02:30] JasonSmith: maxogden: Yeah that is why Linus wants 8 space
[02:30] maxogden: benvie: how about a script that script that parses html without significant memory leaks
[02:30] maxogden: benvie: or convert an XLS to a CSV
[02:30] stantona has joined the channel
[02:30] JasonSmith: (In C) if you are 3 indentations deep, that spells trouble
[02:30] benvie: I don't know if java can do that sorry
[02:31] maxogden: benvie: it can, my point is that javas strength is in the amount of man-hours dumped into its libraries over the last 15 years
[02:31] jamescarr: SubStack, doh... JSON Stream handle http basic auth?
[02:31] SubStack: jamescarr: what are you trying to do?
[02:32] SubStack: JSONStream just takes a stream and returns another stream which is also json
[02:32] jamescarr: I have some JSON based services on another site that use http basic auth to authenticate
[02:32] jamescarr: ah I see
[02:32] benvie: my experience with java and people who spend their time doing things in it is that an inordinate amount of time is spent on the journey going somewhere and not being there
[02:32] jamescarr: nvm... I can make the request myself and pass the stream off
[02:32] SubStack: jamescarr: just pipe it through mikeal's request lib

[02:33] jamescarr: benvie, heh, I blogged about this recently, and my disappointment at some devs in my workplace essentially writing wordpress. In java.
[02:33] benvie: it has its place but I do not like it
[02:34] SubStack: maxogden: yep it's super great if you want to build reliable and performant software
[02:34] SubStack: good thing I just want to build silly programs
[02:34] benvie: yeah that's another thing I see constantly
[02:34] benvie: that's a mentality community thing
[02:34] jamescarr: benvie, my take is I don't mind java, I like JVM langauges like groovy, scala, and clojure. But use the right tool for the right job
[02:34] SubStack: like, ponies
[02:34] jamescarr: I really like Enterprise Integration Pattern type stuff in java
[02:34] SubStack: PONIES I SAY
[02:34] benvie: like node and ruby and python are heavily invested in the whole module reuse public thing
[02:35] SubStack: enterprise ponies
[02:35] ajpiano has joined the channel
[02:35] benvie: and in other community I see everyone basically redoing everything over and over for varioud reasons
[02:35] maxogden: benvie: agreed. cant we all just get along?
[02:35] benvie: yeah enterprise is the worst too and that's java land or .net land. .net is way preferable though
[02:35] benvie: we can indeed
[02:36] zachsmith: I only trust code I myself have written
[02:36] benvie: java people don't seem to want to hang out with us here much and the feeling is mutual
[02:36] SubStack: benvie: not sure, I see plenty of NIH and feature duplication in node
[02:36] alexcheninfo has joined the channel
[02:36] SubStack: much of which I am personally responsible for
[02:36] benvie: oh absolutely
[02:36] benvie: I was just looking at the module list today thinking
[02:36] zachsmith: How do I know that open source stuff hasn't been written by some 15 year old kid
[02:36] zachsmith: I trust enterprises
[02:36] benvie: there's 800 modules for converting xml into json and zero for going the other way as far as I could see
[02:37] benvie: but at least in this case it's reproducing things that are 100 lines of code and not 100,000
[02:37] SubStack: zachsmith: I only use modules written by programmers under 18
[02:37] SubStack: they spoil pretty quickly
[02:37] zachsmith: lol
[02:38] SubStack: real jobs ruin a lot of programmers
[02:38] benvie: yeah that's why I try not to have one

[02:39] marcello3d: so opinionated :)
[02:39] shoobat: noob here, i have an easy question
[02:39] benvie: I'm a huge fan of syntax highlighting and colors and I was making a thing to make it easy to edit tmTheme and tmLanguage files and just found it funny how many ways the node community has come up with to convert xml into anything else
[02:39] marcello3d: only reason to use xml in node is legacy ;)
[02:39] shoobat: i installed node on my vps, server is running and everything.. now how do i connect to it?
[02:39] benvie: and not the reverse
[02:40] marcello3d: or dealing with some API that doesn't support json
[02:40] marcello3d: (also legacy)
[02:40] sunnyx has joined the channel
[02:40] benvie: the tm formats seem to have had staying power

[02:40] jamescarr: I'm sure I'm being stupid somewhere here: https://gist.github.com/1412981
[02:40] marcello3d: shoobat: open http://serverip:port in your browser?
[02:40] jamescarr: npm globally install package doesnt resolve from node console :S
[02:40] isaacs: jamescarr: npm faq
[02:41] isaacs: jamescarr: global installs are not for require()
[02:41] isaacs: they're for cli apps
[02:41] isaacs: and for npm link
[02:41] shoobat: marcello3d sure sure, that works! but.. i want to grab the content and put it onto a site
[02:41] marcello3d: shoobat: not sure what that means...
[02:41] jamescarr: isaacs, man, I think I just need to read all of npms docs each time you have a new release
[02:41] jamescarr: top to bottom :)
[02:41] shoobat: ummm like on a webpage i put <script>connect.to.node.server</script> or something?
[02:41] isaacs: jamescarr: just the faq, really :)
[02:41] marcello3d: jamescarr: it's been that way since 1.0 I think
[02:42] shoobat: some way to interact with the server with JS?
[02:42] shoobat: on client side
[02:42] marcello3d: shoobat: that's not really a node question
[02:43] tonymilne: unless of course he mis understands the link between front end js and server side js.

[02:46] maxogden: d_low: hehe just kidding. JSON.parse
[02:46] d_low: maxogden: will that protect against malicious stuff in the json?

[02:47] maxogden: d_low: pretty sure, its what everyone uses
[02:47] isaacs: d_low: i've got a web service that'll let you post a json string, and it'll return you an object.
[02:47] isaacs: in json
[02:47] maxogden: lol
[02:47] benvie: util.pump

[02:48] isaacs: benvie: oh, that's great.  then you can get it in xml, so you can parse it
[02:48] jamescarr: we have web services in "EX M EL"
[02:49] jamescarr: :)
[02:49] d_low: lol. OK. I'll keep using json.parse. I just thought i read somewhere that this was dangerous
[02:49] chrisvwebdev has joined the channel
[02:49] SubStack: function toXml (json) { return '<xml data=' + json + '></xml>' }
[02:49] marcello3d: d_low: the JSON shims can be dangerous if you don't trust the source
[02:49] d_low: marcello3d: i can't. It's a 3rd party site.
[02:49] marcello3d: but most modern browsers have a proper JSON implementation
[02:50] marcello3d: including v8
[02:50] jamescarr: SubStack, sadly, I HAVE SEEN IT
[02:50] benvie: here's one where the IIS guys win. Goddamn SOAP, embedding JSON in xml cdata
[02:50] benvie: is a winning idea
[02:50] TN has joined the channel
[02:50] jamescarr: <historyItems><!CDATA[[{"some":"json"}]]></historyItems> :)
[02:51] benvie: don't forget that you have to encode all the XML entities and then reparse that before you can parse the json
[02:51] jamescarr: SubStack, I guess to be fair though, the team was migrating some legacy hand woven DOM based XML generation to JSON and it was only like that during the transitional phase
[02:51] benvie: and if it's soap you are as likely to have JSON embedded in XML embedded in other XML
[02:52] benvie: the embedded xml being properly escaped of course
[02:52] jamescarr: seen it
[02:53] benvie: last project I got duped into doing in fact, pulling that shit down to an ipad no less to parse a meg of it at a time
[02:54] Venom_X has joined the channel
[02:54] benvie: I made a quick thing to do the conversion through node first but it couldn't go live, had to pull right from the SOAP service
[02:55] jamescarr: benvie, If you're dealing with SOAP I'd suggest this setup I've done with a SOAP service with several megs of responses:

[03:07] tonymilne: node is good for both.
[03:07] itsme1: okay
[03:07] itsme1: and how is the speed of development in javascript, compared to Python?
[03:07] tonymilne: some people just use express for their web server, and focus on building the web app.
[03:07] tonymilne: for me, much faster. i don't know python. ;)
[03:07] itsme1: okay
[03:08] itsme1: JavaScript is my first prog. language and I want to make good use of it
[03:08] itsme1: I am learning JS atm
[03:08] AndroUser2: How about the speed of development compared to rails?
[03:08] itsme1: sure,go ahead
[03:08] AndroUser2: (Ruby)
[03:09] itsme1: yes? faster or too slow?
[03:09] tonymilne: lol, these are personal preference questions for the large part.
[03:09] tonymilne: I'm much faster with JS (node) than ruby+rails.
[03:09] tonymilne: whats your favourite colour?
[03:09] AndroUser2: Why is that?
[03:09] itsme1: right, got it
[03:09] chjj: *the* favorite color you mean

[03:11] chjj: why do people like that stupid twitter thing

[03:14] chrisvwebdev has left the channel
[03:14] AndroUser2: But you customize the buttons etc right?
[03:15] CaesarC: yes.
[03:15] Dulak: The twitter thing is an epidemic of people that dislike reading.  If you are a reader, twitter's popularity will baffle you.
[03:15] AndroUser2: Because if you don't it will look too twitterish

[03:15] CaesarC: boostrap is one of my css theme.

[03:16] AndroUser2: So node coders are against bootstrap
[03:16] robertj: is it possible to hand-crank the event loop for a context one tick at a time?
[03:16] CaesarC: why?
[03:16] CaesarC: bootstrap is only for css.
[03:16] CaesarC: and js.
[03:17] chjj: because its the same thing as twitter: hype at things that have existed for more than a decade and undeserved popularity
[03:17] skm has joined the channel
[03:17] CaesarC: Of course.

[03:19] pauls1 has joined the channel
[03:19] chjj: its fine, i have no problem with it existing, its just not good, why is it gaining in watchers so steadily?
[03:19] chjj: i dont see anything exceptional there to justify 11k watchers
[03:20] AndroUser2: Bootstrap and rails have the same number of watches
[03:20] chjj: ive seen much better stuff elsewhere, all over github, that has shit and dick for watchers
[03:20] AndroUser2: Right now I wonder if it is going to beat node
[03:22] dgathright has joined the channel
[03:23] Aria: Bootstrap is just likely to serve as common language and infrastructure.
[03:23] Aria: Network benefit, not code benefit.
[03:24] suzuken has joined the channel
[03:24] chjj: Aria: so if i were to put up something better and advertise it, would i get 11k watchers?

[03:26] chjj: obviously not
[03:26] chjj: thats my point exactly
[03:26] chjj: theres pointless hype around it
[03:26] chjj: because the clueless twitter guys use it
[03:26] Aria: And I'm saying that doesn't matter. Because it's good enough, and if a bunch of people know and understand it, _that itself_ is a benefit.

[07:45] brainproxy: JakeyChan: it's like setTimeout(..., 0)
[07:45] JakeyChan: but 
[07:45] JakeyChan: node says it more effection
[07:45] JakeyChan: n
[07:45] brainproxy: except its guaranteed to run on the next trip around the event loop
[07:45] JakeyChan: what's the event loop ?
[07:45] JakeyChan: where ?
[07:45] JakeyChan: who create the event loop ?
[07:46] benvie: node does in C++ land
[07:46] brainproxy: it's a conceptual thing, maintained by the javascript implementation
[07:46] benvie: javascript runs in an event loop
[07:46] benvie: javascript lives in a kind of artificial world
[07:46] jackbean_ has joined the channel
[07:47] JakeyChan: I don't understand  "javascript runs in an event loop"
[07:47] benvie: so
[07:47] benvie: like an operating system has a scheduler
[07:47] benvie: your cpu
[07:47] robotmay has joined the channel
[07:48] benvie: and it continually goes through each program and gives it a slice of CPU time
[07:48] brainproxy: JakeyChan: let me think how to explain, doing so is a good exercise
[07:48] benvie: C++ does something similar for javascript code
[07:48] brainproxy: but don't worry, coming to understand the event loop is just part of maturing in js knowledge
[07:48] benvie: when the event loop is stopped, and doesn't tick over
[07:48] benvie: that's blocking/synchronous
[07:48] brainproxy: that is, don't feel bad you don't know already
[07:48] benvie: everything comes to a standstill
[07:49] JakeyChan: I feel good, you are trying explain for me :D
[07:49] benvie: it's like us humans
[07:49] brainproxy: let's take a browser example
[07:49] JakeyChan: let me read you 
[07:49] chilts: where standstill = idles (ie. doesn't nothing)
[07:49] groom has joined the channel
[07:49] brainproxy: suppose you have a script that does a few things, but is waiting for a mouse click
[07:49] benvie: we sense time as a fluid thing, but our brain actually works in like 10millisecond ticks
[07:49] benvie: that's our brain's event loop
[07:49] shedinja has joined the channel
[07:49] chilts: also, I'd generally steer clear of nextTick() ... it's useful to know about it but I'd generally say you should do it another way :)
[07:50] brainproxy: when the script is finished running whatever the script says to do, the js process goes idle, basically
[07:50] benvie: various things in javascript are scheduled around the event loop
[07:50] benvie: like V8 garbage collects in between ticks
[07:50] brainproxy: but when the hosting environment of the js engine indicates a click event
[07:50] benvie: at that point your code is frozen
[07:50] benvie: for a fraction of a second
[07:51] brainproxy: then whatever "listener" function/logic is attached to the mouse click event will be executed by the js engine
[07:51] brainproxy: that listener logic being supplied somewhere in your script
[07:51] benvie: yeah most of the time it just sits there idle
[07:51] benvie: which is why it can be very responsive when something does happen
[07:51] brainproxy: now, in addition to external event sources, like clicks and key presses
[07:52] brainproxy: the js engine supplies an internal event source, namely a timer
[07:52] brainproxy: when you write a setTimeout, your basically telling the js engine to fire an event after the specified amount of time
[07:52] brainproxy: and the function supplied to settimeout gets runs when that event fires
[07:52] JakeyChan: you confused me 
[07:53] matejv has joined the channel
[07:53] brainproxy: which part, i will try to do better
[07:53] JakeyChan: let me search some document 
[07:53] brainproxy: okay
[07:53] benvie: you could just think of it like
[07:53] JakeyChan: brainproxy: thanks a lot :D
[07:54] brainproxy: you're welcome ... i remember strugglingn with this about 2 years ago
[07:54] brainproxy: then finally had the "aha moment"
[07:54] benvie: every millisecond node/v8 check to see if something new has come up, or a timer has run out. If so it wakes up yuor javascript code and relays the message
[07:54] benvie: otherwise it sleeps
[07:54] benvie: on that continuous cycle
[07:54] chilts: yeah, I think doing JS always requires an 'aha' moment :)
[07:54] chilts: same with Git ... I remember when I 'got' that :D
[07:55] rendar has joined the channel
[07:55] chilts: benvie: I don't think node/v8 checks, I think the OS wakes it up when an event has occured
[07:55] benvie: most of the hard work is handed off to other process, native C and C++ code. Javascript is lazy and sleeps and just gives directions
[07:55] simenbrekken has joined the channel
[07:56] benvie: er yeah I meant
[07:56] benvie: the os pings back to uv technically
[07:56] brainproxy: benvie: was reading about the weak maps, interesting stuff
[07:56] benvie: and then uv relays to v8
[07:57] benvie: yeah weak maps confused me at first, I didn't understand the purpose or benefit
[07:58] benvie: but it makes sense now that I understand better how memory and references work in javascript engines
[07:58] benvie: v8 and spidermonkey anyway
[07:58] benvie: it's a thing that you don't see in js but the performance would affect you
[07:58] benvie: also there's the ability (with proxies) give revokable access to objects
[07:58] benvie: which is neato
[07:59] brainproxy: i'm actually got something similar in a library i'm writing, but my "weaklyHeld" logic and cleanup works a bit differently owing to how objects get chained together

[07:59] monokrom_ has joined the channel
[07:59] brainproxy: basically i've got my own little garbage collector thing ... but when harmony stuff gets finalized, i may detect for environment support and use the native facility
[08:00] Wa has joined the channel
[08:00] benvie: well I think once the new v8 is in node you'll want to use WeakMaps
[08:00] brainproxy: well my lib is designed for cross-platform work
[08:00] JakeyChan: hey, about event loop and process.nextTick, I still have questions 
[08:00] JakeyChan: :)
[08:00] JakeyChan: sorry for my stupid
[08:00] benvie: oh as in not all in node? browser or non js?
[08:00] brainproxy: so node support isn't enough to warrant dropping the pre-harmony implementation
[08:00] JakeyChan: node
[08:00] benvie: yeah
[08:01] JakeyChan: node create event loop ? or v8 ?
[08:01] benvie: long time before it's usable in a browser
[08:01] benvie: libuv does
[08:01] JakeyChan: ok
[08:01] Morkel has joined the channel
[08:01] benvie: v8 needs an event loop one way or another
[08:01] JakeyChan: so when the event loop begin to process next tick ?
[08:01] benvie: in Chrome the event loop ties into webkit
[08:02] benvie: the event loop goes well before V8 ever even starts
[08:02] benvie: it's used for everything, not just javascript
[08:02] chilts: JakeyChan: your program goes into the event loop once it has reached the end of your script
[08:02] benvie: yeah V8 initializes on it
[08:02] abraxas has joined the channel
[08:02] benvie: but it's being used prior to that for internal C++ land stuff too
[08:03] benvie: in node there's not much difference
[08:03] benvie: much bigger in Chromium
[08:03] benvie: a lot more stuff living outside of javascript's reach
[08:03] benvie: but it still makes use of event loops for a everything
[08:03] Margle has joined the channel
[08:03] benvie: event loops are how GUIs work
[08:04] JakeyChan: var MyConstructor = function() {
[08:04] JakeyChan:   ...
[08:04] JakeyChan:   process.nextTick(function() {
[08:04] JakeyChan:     self._continue();
[08:04] JakeyChan:   });
[08:04] JakeyChan: };
[08:04] JakeyChan: MyConstructor.prototype.__proto__ = EventEmitter.prototype;
[08:04] JakeyChan: MyConstructor.prototype._continue = function() {
[08:04] JakeyChan:   // without the process.nextTick
[08:04] JakeyChan:   // these events would be emitted immediately
[08:04] JakeyChan:   // with no listeners. they would be lost.
[08:04] JakeyChan:   this.emit('data', 'hello');
[08:04] JakeyChan:   this.emit('data', 'world');
[08:04] JakeyChan:   this.emit('end');
[08:04] brainproxy: JakeyChan: the event loop is an abstract idea which you don't need to understand in terms of its implementation in most cases
[08:04] JakeyChan: this's example I found from google
[08:05] chilts: JakeyChan: try not to paste code into the channel, use a paste service like pastebin or gist.github.com
[08:05] brainproxy: JakeyChan: might want to use gist or pastie or something :p
[08:05] petrjanda has joined the channel
[08:05] JakeyChan: :)
[08:05] JakeyChan: yeah yeah , sorry for that 
[08:05] brainproxy: it's considered rude to paste multi-line stuff in irc
[08:05] benvie: libuv actually has a specific thing to always keep the event loop alive for one extra tick before it goes away
[08:05] benvie: so you get that last notification
[08:05] benvie: like in browsers where you can listen for the page close event, same idea

[10:02] wereHamster: no, don't ever test or use myReadFile. Just test myProcessData and pass it the data you want to test
[10:03] wereHamster: I mean, don't test or use myReadFIle in tests
[10:03] kmox83 has joined the channel
[10:03] wereHamster: like, do this in your tests:  assert.equals(myProcessData(null, "your json string"), "...")
[10:03] jacobrask: ok, I guess I could make another wrapper function which wraps those two together so I don't have to mess upp my main code narrative with more function calls and callbacks

[12:39] Industrial: Why are call stacks only 10 lines long? Can I see the whole call chain?
[12:39] Industrial: most of them end in some Promise object somewhere and I dont know where its coming from
[12:39] eddyb: augustl: V8 was created with ARM support in mind
[12:40] augustl: eddyb: hmm neat
[12:40] eddyb: "May 31st 2011: The instructions on this page don't work anymore!" heh
[12:41] augustl: so linux itself works fine on ARM? I thought that was work in progress.
[12:42] eddyb: wtf?

[12:49] tuhoojabotti: linux 1.0
[12:50] eddyb: augustl: well, in openSUSE you can choose
[12:50] zomg: "stable stuff that has few bugs"
[12:50] augustl: old software as in the newest and hopefully recent version of old software ;)

[12:52] eddyb: I guess you haven't used a newer-than-2010 version
[12:53] Industrial: augustl: https://gist.github.com/7e123c0a269b18aae1c5
[12:53] augustl: eddyb: I used the most recent version available on arch linux
[12:53] eddyb: like, the past two openSUSE versions (or the past three) came with a kde4 theme for gtk
[12:53] augustl: eddyb: which is probably the most recent version :)
[12:53] Industrial: augustl: it doesnt end at model.<anonymous>
[12:53] eddyb: augustl: can you do a quick version test?
[12:53] Industrial: augustl: it should be going on way back to when I run my unit test to the unit test JS file etc
[12:53] Industrial: but it caps at 10 lines
[12:53] Industrial: always.
[12:53] Industrial: why is that?
[12:54] eddyb: because v8
[12:54] Industrial: so v8 doesnt give full stack traces, that's it? :p
[12:54] tuhoojabotti: It's as full as it can be
[12:55] alexcheninfo: I'm not sure if this is a myth but are most node developers vim users?
[12:55] augustl: eddyb: ugh, packages.archlinux.org doesn't list it since "kde" is a meta package
[12:55] mc_greeny has joined the channel
[12:55] Industrial: tuhoojabotti: it ends somewhere in the mongoose library. Some code is making that query so it's definately not as full as it can be.
[12:55] augustl: eddyb: http://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/kde-meta-kdebase/ seems like 4.7
[12:56] Industrial: tuhoojabotti: it should end with the first function, no? :P
[12:56] tuhoojabotti: Industrial: It's the negative side of using the event-loop?
[12:56] anaio has joined the channel
[12:56] augustl: eddyb: Arch's packages are pretty bare bone though. No extra integration etc, just a pure install.
[12:56] Industrial: tuhoojabotti: explain, I don't understand that.
[12:56] eddyb: augustl:http://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/oxygen-gtk/
[12:56] augustl: eddyb: so I guess it's possible/easy to make gtk apps pretty in kde too
[12:56] eddyb: you want that
[12:57] augustl: eddyb: I do find KDE and especially QT interesting.. I'll give it another go

[14:38] v8bot_: augustl: Don't cheat!  You can't give a beer to yourself.
[14:38] catb0t: augustl now has 1 beer
[14:38] augustl: I like catb0t
[14:38] catb0t: like PUT and DEL I
[14:38] lmatteis: so why is libuv actually called libuv, instead of just "node"? :)
[14:38] augustl: lmatteis: because node is not libuv I guess
[14:38] joemccann has joined the channel
[14:38] creationix: Rust uses libuv too
[14:38] augustl: node is v8 and all that jazz
[14:38] creationix: (the mozilla language)
[14:38] DRMacIver has joined the channel
[14:39] lmatteis: augustl: but libuv is implemented using v8
[14:39] lmatteis: or not?
[14:39] augustl: no it's stand alone
[14:39] creationix: lmatteis: it's straight C
[14:39] lmatteis: ah ok
[14:39] augustl: lmatteis: node uses v8 to execute javascript, and libuv to do asynchronous disk and network
[14:39] creationix: which is great, because Luajit is also C
[14:39] lmatteis: so it's just a cross-platform libevent
[14:39] creationix: so luvit doesn't have to use any C++
[14:40] augustl: lmatteis: no it's implementations of none blocking IO afaik
[14:40] creationix: lmatteis: it does more than libevent
[14:40] lmatteis: ok

[14:53] bogomips2_ has joined the channel
[14:54] JakeyChan has joined the channel
[14:55] lmatteis: Scala_: to work asynchronously Node doesn't spawn a new thread
[14:55] galaxywatcher has joined the channel
[14:55] Scala_: lmatteis: How does it achieve concurrency?
[14:55] lmatteis: depends what your script is doing
[14:55] Scala_: Lets say I want to read from a database
[14:56] lmatteis: if it does I/O, like communicates with a db somewhere, the piece of code will just "idle" in the main thread without blocking other operations
[14:56] lmatteis: so while your code is reading from a database, the same thread can do other stuff
[14:57] Scala_: How does it idle without blocking if it doesn't use threads?
[14:57] lmatteis: and when your db has finished reading, the code that was idling will finish what's it doing by usually calling the "callback"
[14:57] lmatteis: Scala_: things can idle without blocking
[14:58] lmatteis: that's how the event loop works
[14:58] Scala_: Let me make sure of one thing before I keep asking questions
[14:58] Scala_: Does the javascript event loop run in one thread or a process?
[14:58] lmatteis: you must understand that the processing required to read from the database, is handled by the database itself, so no processing is done in the main thread of your node program
[14:59] lmatteis: just one thread
[14:59] cha0s has joined the channel
[14:59] rurufufuss has joined the channel
[15:00] Scala_: I think the thing that confuses me is that if you had code written in a serial manner (not necessarily node), that runs in one thread, and when you make a query to a database, it'll block until it receives data back
[15:00] lmatteis: i'm not sure how the idling is achieved, it's a low-level OS functionality
[15:00] idl3 has joined the channel
[15:01] lmatteis: Scala_: right, but that's the whole idea behind Node, that it's not like that
[15:01] lmatteis: in the regular approach imagine you had to do 4 different database queries
[15:01] lmatteis: so you make 4 db.query() calls, ok?
[15:01] lmatteis: they each block, so each one of those has to wait until the other finishes
[15:02] Scala_: The picture I get is this: I have my event loop running, and then I make a query to a database.  The query to the database idles for data and the event loop keeps going.  When the data comes back, now there's two code execution flows going, the event loop and the callback to handle data from the database.  Can one thread handle two code execution flows?
[15:02] Lingerance: select() and poll() are used to make the OS tell the application when an FD is ready for reading, node uses one of the two or an equivolent to function.
[15:02] Lingerance: Those existed long before threading.

[15:02] stagas has joined the channel

[15:03] lmatteis: Scala_: no, there's never 2 things running at the same time
[15:03] lmatteis: in 1 thread
[15:04] Scala_: Oh, so the event loop will get a signal to query the database.  The database does it's own thing and the event loop keeps running, and then the event loop will get a signal that the database is done reading, so it jumps into code execution for the callback with the data?
[15:04] lmatteis: so after the callback is executed, the regular event loop continues
[15:04] jstash has joined the channel
[15:04] JakeyChan_ has joined the channel
[15:04] lmatteis: right
[15:04] Scala_: Oh, makes sense
[15:05] swestcott_ has joined the channel
[15:05] lmatteis: so now you have 4 queries that no longer take the sum of the amount that each one takes
[15:05] lmatteis: but it only takes the amount the "longest" query takes
[15:05] Scala_: It works because it doesn't keep checking if the database is done doing its thing, the database makes its queries and tells the event loop "Hey, I'm done! Here's what I have"
[15:05] lmatteis: (sorry about my broken english :-))

[15:07] lmatteis: i'd also like to understand how select() and poll() work at a lower level
[15:07] lmatteis: seems interesting
[15:07] lmatteis: but the global concept is what you said, yes
[15:08] booyaa: right let's play around with ntlm and auth. i hate iis
[15:08] Scala_: Lingerance: Thanks for the select() and poll() info.  I'll look into those, and I might poke into the Node source to see how they do that.
[15:08] bradleyg has joined the channel
[15:09] lmatteis: all i know is that select() simply blocks until the file descriptor status changes to "read"... or something like that
[15:09] lmatteis: i mean, one of the file descriptors
[15:09] Scala_: But it can't block, or else it would hold up the event loop?
[15:10] lmatteis: but haven't used it in many years, and frankly now that Node abstracts it very nicely, i don't really have to understand it :)

[15:39] baudehlo: rachet: I wouldn't use SpamAssassin for the filtering though - it's trained for email spam.
[15:39] bnoordhuis: lmatteis: you had a question about event loops?
[15:39] rachet: baudehlo: what would you use? something custom?
[15:39] lmatteis: bnoordhuis: yes, just how the low-levels work. how does the main event loop communicate with, say, the database where it spawned a query
[15:40] bnoordhuis: lmatteis: through file descriptors (on unices)
[15:40] baudehlo: If I was starting from scratch? To be honest probably just strict moderation of first N posts for each submitter.
[15:40] diminoten: even if I change the require lines to point to where the folders actuall are, it still doesn't find the modules listed, even though they're there
[15:40] rachet: I'm trying to get something automated :/
[15:41] bnoordhuis: lmatteis: connections / sockets are file descriptors on unix systems, you can pool them and watch them for changes with syscalls like select, poll, kqueue, etc.
[15:41] baudehlo: I'd also use surbl, uribl and dbl on any URLs posted in comments.

[15:42] cgray has joined the channel
[15:42] rachet: surbl?
[15:42] lmatteis: bnoordhuis: ok, a little more than that? so in my node program i call db.query(function(){..}); and i suppose it tells the DB to run that stuff and then continues the regular event loop execution... but when it tells it to run the query it also sets up this file descriptor that the DB uses to "signal" when the query has been done?
[15:42] baudehlo: rachet: those three are dns blocklists for domain names used in spam.
[15:42] rachet: awesome.
[15:43] baudehlo: lmatteis: it depends on the database driver.
[15:43] lmatteis: bnoordhuis: ok, but to "watch" the file descriptor whether it has changed (the DB has written it or something), the main event loop must use something like select(), right? and select() blocks
[15:43] baudehlo: yes select blocks. But only until it has something to do.
[15:43] lmatteis: baudehlo: right, and where does it block? it cant block in the main event loop
[15:43] baudehlo: remember it's not just listening on that one file descriptor, it's listening on all of them.
[15:44] lmatteis: yes sure
[15:44] baudehlo: yes it "blocks" in the main event loop
[15:44] rachet: so far, it looks like I can combine URL blacklists with activity filters, and some sort of word naturalizer to help check the content
[15:44] r04r has joined the channel
[15:44] baudehlo: that's what an event loop is.
[15:44] rachet: basically prevent someone from just putting "cocks" a million times
[15:44] lmatteis: so how is the rest of my node code going to be executed if it's stuck on select()?
[15:44] davemo has joined the channel
[15:45] bnoordhuis: lmatteis: you can pass a timeout parameter to select()
[15:45] bnoordhuis: so if nothing interesting happens in say 500 ms, select() will return and you continue with whatever you were doing
[15:45] joshkehn has joined the channel
[15:45] lmatteis: and then go back to select()?
[15:45] joshkehn has left the channel
[15:45] lmatteis: where my callback is then executed?
[15:45] bnoordhuis: between the calls to select()
[15:46] lmatteis: yes
[15:46] bnoordhuis: it works like this: there's a set of fds we watch for changes
[15:46] bnoordhuis: and then there's things like timers
[15:46] lmatteis: so how does it know to end the node process, seems like this event loop continues
[15:46] vrs has joined the channel
[15:46] baudehlo: lmatteis: code only needs to run when something is happening on a file descriptor, or a timer event happens.
[15:46] bnoordhuis: so right before we call select(), we look up when the next timer is supposed to run
[15:46] vrs: bnoordhuis: i was told by make to bug you
[15:46] bnoordhuis: if that's in 500 ms, we pass that as the timeout to select()
[15:47] bnoordhuis: vrs: try pasting the exact message :)
[15:47] lmatteis: ok
[15:47] vrs: `make install` is not implemented yet. Bug bnoordhuis about it in #node.js
[15:47] makeInstallBot: vrs: `make install` is not supported on current node.js `master` due to build system refactor. Please use latest stable tag (v0.6.x).
[15:47] bnoordhuis: ^ awesome isn't it :)
[15:47] vrs: :)
[15:47] bnoordhuis: it's good that people bug me about it though, i really should get `make install` fixed
[15:48] bnoordhuis: lmatteis: in a nutshell, we only block in select() if there's nothing else to do
[15:48] lmatteis: bnoordhuis: ok.... so when does the program end?
[15:48] scttnlsn has joined the channel
[15:48] lmatteis: when there's no more file descriptors?
[15:48] Samuel_Roldan has joined the channel

[15:53] bnoordhuis: lmatteis: when the last line of your script has been executed, we enter the event loop proper

[15:57] lmatteis: bnoordhuis: so all the db.query(callback); does is that it writes a file descriptor that the DB driver uses as well?
[15:57] lmatteis: bnoordhuis: what if the DB driver "writes" the file descriptor before the node js program has finished execution?
[15:58] josh_k has joined the channel
[15:58] lmatteis: then it enters the event loop... and the event has already been fired
[15:58] lmatteis: so i guess the timeout fixes this?
[15:58] joshsmith: I'm using gnoguchi's everyauth; is there any way to add custom info to my session?
[15:59] bnoordhuis: lmatteis: a file descriptor is a two-way communication channel between the client (your code) and the server
[15:59] alFReD-NSH has joined the channel
[15:59] bnoordhuis: lmatteis: if you (or the db library) writes to the fd, the server receives a query

[16:00] r04r has joined the channel
[16:00] bnoordhuis: lmatteis: if the server writes to its counterpart, you receive a response
[16:00] lmatteis: bnoordhuis: yes
[16:00] lmatteis: right i understand that
[16:00] eldios: this is more of a best practice than an absolute rule I'd say

[16:03] zomg: alFReD-NSH: you probably should be passing dependencies in constructor or setters to your objects
[16:03] stantona has joined the channel
[16:04] zomg: but besides that you probably won't really need much IoC/DI type stuff
[16:04] alFReD-NSH: @zomg that's what I usually do....
[16:05] alFReD-NSH: But I thought maybe ioc is the cleaner way of it, though I don't know what is.... :D

[16:34] vlucas: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Contributing says to run "make test"

[18:13] GrizzLyCRO: why is syntax for modules "module.exports = item;" instead of "module.exports(item)"
[18:13] tbranyen: because exports is not a function
[18:13] GrizzLyCRO: when i see "exports" i think its function
[18:13] tbranyen: GrizzLyCRO: well thats unfortunate :-/

[18:15] GrizzLyCRO: tbranyen: thanks for explanation, makes sense
[18:15] GrizzLyCRO: diminoten: thats wrong, then it should be exports.add()
[18:16] GrizzLyCRO: because if its cargo, each time you change value, you "replace" old cargo
[18:16] diminoten: you've only got room for one export

[18:18] GrizzLyCRO: not really important though :)

[18:22] GrizzLyCRO: yeah, i see

[21:57] slickplaid: Oh, I'm sure it's possible. But our timeline is way too close for me to start work on that at the moment.

[22:12] joshsmith: why should I use nodejitsu over Heroku?
[22:12] waterhead: slickplaid: i'm implementing a crowd sourced map reduce based system, so i only *need* the end result ASAP. there are two opportunities for streaming (and thus simultaneously using as much cpu and network as possible). first, sending input data in individual kv pairs or in chunks of them out to map workers, which will process one kv pair at a time. second, emitting intermediate/final kv pairs from mappers/reducers. in each case it would be nice to transmit
[22:13] waterhead: computing if possible, but that approach would be bad if socketio doesn't like getting spammed, which it would be when computational requirements are low.

[22:14] mmalecki: we have monkeys?
[22:15] slickplaid: joshsmith: current node version, quick support, open source, and monkeys
[22:15] mmalecki: joshsmith: `jitsu deploy` is all you need. not sure about comparison with heroku tho, that's what I've heard
[22:15] slickplaid: that's at least six reasons
[22:15] slickplaid: cause we all know monkeys come in threes
[22:15] ovaillancourt: isaacs: Is there a way to report faulty modules and stuff like that with npm right now (10 minutes late on your policy idea)

[22:18] isaacs: ovaillancourt: that's the most reliable

[22:19] slickplaid: i don't know why I don't just get two beers when I start drinking. I just sat down and my beer is empty
[22:19] isaacs: i figure what i'd probably do is have some kind of counter, and every day, some automated thing could check every package, and update the counter and email the maintainer, and when it hits 10, unpublish it

[22:44] eeemsi: is git branch v0.6 the stable one?
[22:44] teadict: fair enough
[22:45] brianc: otherwise sometimes watch count is too much a popularity contest. who's coolest doesn't always mean who's module is best
[22:45] teadict: helps though
[22:45] brianc: it does
[22:45] brianc: and the more eyes on something arguably it's more stable
[22:45] teadict: since it's the open source ideology kicking in
[22:45] teadict: kinda
[22:47] brianc: yar
[22:47] diminoten: okay anyone here use express?
[22:47] jerrysv: diminoten: i use bricks :)
[22:47] lazyshot has joined the channel
[22:48] diminoten: I dunno what that is :(
[22:48] diminoten: unless you mean the clay object
[22:48] jerrysv: diminoten: http://bricksjs.com/
[22:48] diminoten: in which case I'm all over that
[22:48] diminoten: oh
[22:48] fly-away has joined the channel
[22:49] brianc: diminoten: plenty of us use express...there's also a #express room 
[22:49] diminoten: oh cool
[22:49] elijahwright has joined the channel
[22:50] tvw has joined the channel
[22:50] teadict: how is bricks preferable to express or others?
[22:51] jerrysv: teadict: different approach - apache hook style routing, events
[22:51] teadict: okey.. another question
[22:51] teadict: in which cases is bricks peferrable?
[22:51] teadict: that r moved
[22:52] diminoten: go answer my question brianc :-P
[22:52] diminoten: haha that's fairly bossy of me, sorry
[22:52] jerrysv: teadict: when you need to operate several operations on a single route -- let's say /admin requires sessions, but nothing else does, or modifications to specific content, or adding a transparent caching layer
[22:53] teadict: ic...
[22:53] devongovett has joined the channel
[22:53] jerrysv: teadict: so set up a route for sessions for /admin/.+ and an acl layer on /admin/.+
[22:53] jerrysv: teadict: and make sure that css or js get cached until a timeout or some other external event happens
[22:53] jerrysv: clean up headers after render, etc
[22:54] jerrysv: teadict: and no connect
[22:54] mehtryx has joined the channel
[22:54] diminoten: since this channel is way more active than #express, I'll ask here too
[22:54] diminoten: nevermind
[22:55] teadict: jerrysv: too complex for my project, I'll stick to express I think
[22:55] jerrysv: teadict: obviously not for everyone :)

[23:06] isaacs: springmeyer: no.
[23:06] springmeyer: I'm running npm 1.1.0-alpha-2
[23:06] isaacs: springmeyer: it's fixed by a different thing :)

[23:06] isaacs: springmeyer: get a newer alpha from http://npmjs.org/dist/
[23:06] isaacs: springmeyer: 5 should not have that bug.
