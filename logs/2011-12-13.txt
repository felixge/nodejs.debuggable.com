[00:48] mikeal: no
[00:48] mikeal: you only use encoding if you're passing a callback
[00:48] mikeal: and you want the "body" option to be encoded
[00:48] mikeal: if you're streaming to a file encoding doesn't matter

[01:00] memcap: Thanks for the info Lingerance: and bnoordhuis: I'm still trying to figure out a solution. I have a Buffer (a JPG) in memory and I would like to convert it to a stream - so that I can pass a readable stream object as a parameter to another module. Any way to do this without reading/writing to the file system? This is likely a gap in my understanding of streams... A pointer to sample code would be great. Regards.

[01:02] maxogden: memcap: how did you get the jpg into a buffer in the first place?
[01:02] memcap: maxogden: It was given to my code via an IMAP module.
[01:03] maxogden: memcap: im guessing the imap module isnt streaming?

[01:04] dgathright_ has joined the channel
[01:04] memcap: maxogden: I believe I get an email message as a stream, including the attachments (the JPG, in this case), and then a mail parser gives me a buffer.
[01:05] maxogden: memcap: ideally you could just accept a stream from the imap client and pass it to your other module but that is dependent on the imap library
[01:05] maxogden: memcap: you might find this useful https://github.com/maxogden/haraka-couchdb/blob/master/plugins/couchdb.js

[02:48] JasonSmith: isaacs: The only question I wanted to ask you is, currently, packages do a lot of require("kanso/foo"), but it sucks to put all the public API at the top-level, because Kanso is a complex project doing many things
[02:49] isaacs: JasonSmith: yeah.  they need to not do that, or do require("kanso/lib/foo")
[02:49] JasonSmith: package.json has a "main" field so I can put my entry point anywhere in the project
[02:49] isaacs: yeah.
[02:49] isaacs: we're not going to ressurrect the "modules" hash or the "lib" directory, if that's where you're going.
[02:49] isaacs: been there.  it is dumb.
[02:49] aroman has joined the channel
[02:49] isaacs: for what?  to save a few ../blah or require("foo/lib/bar"?

[02:50] isaacs: Aria: Github-flavored-markdown, the npm package, is a js thing that the github folks ported from showdown
[02:50] mikeric_ has joined the channel
[02:50] isaacs: and then i ported to npm
[02:51] isaacs: JasonSmith: but, if Kanso can export the thing that all the things hang on, and then do require("kanso").foo, then that's highly flexible and can be lovely.

[02:51] JasonSmith: isaacs: Yeah that is what I will try to encourage
[02:51] JasonSmith: thanks much!
[02:51] isaacs: JasonSmith: np.
[02:52] isaacs: JasonSmith: Here's the thing that was the nail in the coffin, ultimately:
[02:52] isaacs: JasonSmith: it's not that important that you know what your code does.  you wrote it.  you know what it does.  saving an insignificant amount of esthetic pain on your part is of very limited value.
[02:52] isaacs: JasonSmith: on the other hand, this whole magic lib dir, or modules nested, but not nested using the actual paths, makes it much harder for any new contributors to know wth is going on.
[02:52] JasonSmith: yeah, he already merged my fixes for inter-package requires
[02:53] JasonSmith: yeah, also it seems like you could totally confuse node. Baiscally you're talking about doing the same thing as require.paths
[02:53] isaacs: JasonSmith: yeah, sort of
[02:53] isaacs: JasonSmith: in the end, we decided "main" is nice, so you can treat the package as one "thing".  but beyond that?  it's a folder.  you want submodules?  they're files.  have fun.
[02:54] JasonSmith: as-is, kanso sets $NODE_PATH and I'm trying to move it to 100% going with the NPM grain, which I am calling "the Catholic experience"
[02:54] isaacs: this is super duper obvious.

[05:26] RORgasm_: ?
[05:26] RORgasm_: the dgram module seem pretty straightforward to me
[05:26] RORgasm_: i guess i'm not sure what kind of use cases are better suited for UDP communication as opposed to TCP
[05:26] RORgasm_: thoughts?

[05:43] chrisdickinson: RORgasm: UDP does not guarantee delivery (at all, or even in order). TCP does, I do believe.
[05:44] Aria: Kind-of.
[05:44] mikeal has joined the channel
[05:44] meso has joined the channel
[05:44] Aria: tcp rate-limits, windows, streams, and handles retransmits, and generally lets you know within the window size what the other end has received.
[05:44] Aria: UDP gives you checksums and not much else. But that's entirely unrelated to what RORgasm_ asked.
[05:44] RORgasm_: hmm
[05:45] RORgasm_: so for trying to stream a video form some client to a server to another client
[05:45] RORgasm_: would UDP make sense?
[05:45] kejun has joined the channel
[05:45] Aria: Depends on the use case.
[05:46] RORgasm_: well
[05:46] Aria: Your overhead with TCP is going to be minimal in that case, and with modern retransmit algorithms, won't even slow down for a missed packet here and there.
[05:46] Aria: And can your video decoder deal with dropped packets? What sort of interleaving does it need or have?
[05:46] RORgasm_: hmm
[05:47] RORgasm_: Aria:  i haven't done much of this...just a thought experiment
[05:47] RORgasm_: that on an iOS device
[05:47] Aria: Hehe. It really depends on some specifics.
[05:47] Aria: However, Apple uses TCP if that's any indication.
[05:47] Aria: RTSP.
[05:47] RORgasm_: i would grab a video stream from the camera and broadcast it to a UDP nodejs server which then broadcasts it to other clients connected to that server
[05:47] RORgasm_: ah
[05:47] RORgasm_: i see
[05:47] RORgasm_: RTSP is over TCP?
[05:48] RORgasm_: wasn't sure of that
[05:48] Aria: Yeah, it is.
[05:48] RORgasm_: cool
[05:48] RORgasm_: hmm
[05:48] Aria: How important is sync? Is this video compressed?
[05:48] RORgasm_: it would be compressed 
[05:48] chrisdickinson: Aria: (sorry for the foggy/inexact explanation earlier)
[05:48] RORgasm_: but it won't have to be stored anywhere
[05:48] RORgasm_: so if packets are lost...they're lost
[05:48] RORgasm_: no harm done
[05:49] Aria: Big harm done.
[05:49] Aria: Compressed video loses sync easily with single dropped packets.
[05:49] RORgasm_: so i'm thinking then i can just stream the video over websockets to the server then
[05:49] RORgasm_: Aria:  i c
[05:49] Aria: Interesting. Why websockets? (what client software?)
[05:49] RORgasm_: Aria:  purely a thought experiemnt
[05:49] RORgasm_: right now
[05:50] Aria: ACTION nods.
[05:50] RORgasm_: i've deone websocket communiation
[05:50] RORgasm_: from iOS devices to nodejs servers
[05:50] Aria: Websockets is message-oriented, so that's probably a downside in this case.
[05:50] RORgasm_: via faye
[05:50] RORgasm_: i love it :)
[05:50] RORgasm_: i'm not an iOS dev
[05:50] Aria: Not pure streaming.
[05:50] RORgasm_: i usually work with someone
[05:50] RORgasm_: who is
[05:50] RORgasm_: well
[05:50] RORgasm_: we're trying to get streaming i guess
[05:50] RORgasm_: but we don't want to save the video stream as a fiel
[05:51] Aria: ACTION nods.
[05:51] lulzilla has joined the channel
[05:51] RORgasm_: essentially i was wondeirng how hard a video caht thing would be to build via websockets
[05:51] Aria: Probably quite doable.
[05:51] lulzilla: does forever rerun a script after a reboot?
[05:51] RORgasm_: where teh video is not being stored anywhere per se but just transmitted 
[05:51] Aria: Yeah.
[05:51] RORgasm_: Aria:  so you're thinking something like that can be done over websockets without having to drop down to UDP sockets?
[05:52] Aria: Yes, but I'd probably go TCP, not websocket.
[05:52] Aria: (In fact, I'd use RTSP)
[05:52] RORgasm_: websocket is over TCP though
[05:52] bminer has joined the channel
[05:52] RORgasm_: isn't it?
[05:52] bminer: hi
[05:52] Aria: Yes, but it's a message-oriented layer on TOP of TCP.
[05:52] Aria: And video is streamy, not message-oriented.
[05:52] RORgasm_: i see
[05:53] chrisdickinson: so, a message sent from a client to a server via a websocket is guaranteed to arrive eventually, right?
[05:53] RORgasm_: so back to my original question
[05:53] RORgasm_: where do UDP sockets come in handy?
[05:53] bminer: quick question for anyone out there... any good node static asset deployment libraries?
[05:53] Aria: chrisdickinson: Transmit half message. Cut wire. Logic says no.
[05:53] RORgasm_: when would one want to use them instead
[05:53] RORgasm_: ?
[05:53] chrisdickinson: haha.
[05:53] Aria: chrisdickinson: If you figure out how to guarantee delviery in a network, let someone know.
[05:53] Aria: RORgasm_: Chat is naturally messagey. Web page updates, game packets .. .all message-like.
[05:53] chrisdickinson: well, guaranteed inasmuch as TCP guarantees delivery.
[05:54] Aria: And great for when the client is a web browser, since browsers don't expose pure TCP sockets to pages.
[05:54] brokenjames has joined the channel
[05:54] RORgasm_: right
[05:54] RORgasm_: and UDP sockets?
[05:54] bminer: UDP comes in handy when you are broadcasting a lot of packets and don't care as much if they make it
[05:54] Aria: TCP doesn't guarantee delivery. It guarantees that an ACK must come back at least once per window to keep sending.
[05:55] RORgasm_: bminer: Aria any particular example come to mind where something liek that might be useful?
[05:55] Aria: UDP is good for implementing probey protocols -- things like gossip consensus, multicast transmission, and stuff like that.
[05:55] nmir has joined the channel
[05:55] jjd has joined the channel
[05:55] Aria: Where you tend to have many unreliable, weakly connected nodes.
[05:55] RORgasm_: where does multicast transmission come in handy?
[05:55] bminer: RORgasm_: sure... anything that might be multicast... like older LAN-based video games used UDP
[05:55] Aria: Video streaming on a LAN.
[05:55] bminer: video streaming is good
[05:56] chrisdickinson: re: using UDP for video games: http://vimeo.com/1808631
[05:56] Aria: Also: UDP is perfect for fixed-bandwidth, better-lost-than-late.
[05:56] Aria: Like realtime streaming. Like voice.
[05:56] RORgasm_: ah
[05:56] hoborick has joined the channel
[05:56] RORgasm_: hmm
[05:56] bminer: so like...Skype *could* use UDP... maybe
[05:56] RORgasm_: so...we just were talking about how tcp would be better for video chat then udp earlier :)
[05:57] Aria: VoIP codecs are usually optimized to be able to tolerate any frame getting lost.
[05:57] RORgasm_: Aria:  ^ ?
[05:57] nmir: hey, does anyone know where i can find a proper example of rendering form validation errors back to the user in a node+express site? the req.flash thing seems like it is meant more for messages than field-level error messages (like "invalid email address" next to a form field)
[05:57] Aria: Their coding isn't interdependent.
[05:57] Aria: Video, on the other hand, tends to drop everything until the next I-frame when it loses a chunk.
[05:57] Aria: Which on tightly coded video (I-frames are expensive!) could be a minute or more.
[05:58] hoborick: Is the cluster API that's now part of Node that same one that Learnboost made?
[05:59] Aria: No.
[05:59] RORgasm_: bminer: Aria check this out http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6187456/tcp-vs-udp-on-video-stream
[05:59] Aria: But some similar ideas. Node's is lower-level.
[05:59] RORgasm_: bminer: Aria in my case the video would not be stored...so udp u think?
[05:59] SamuraiJack has joined the channel
[06:00] hoborick: nmir: I seem to remember this doing that (providing validations errors mingled with form HTML): https://github.com/caolan/forms
[06:00] hoborick: Aria: Ah, thanks.
[06:00] Aria: No, I think TCP ;-)
[06:00] kevinswiber has joined the channel
[06:00] Aria: Are your clients local?
[06:00] Aria: Or remote?
[06:00] bminer: RORgasm_: I dunno... maybe see what Flash Media Server does???
[06:01] RORgasm_: Aria: remote
[06:01] Aria: Okay, so you have bandwidth sensitivity too.
[06:01] bminer: RORgasm_: check this out... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Media_Flow_Protocol
[06:01] bminer: Aria:                    ^
[06:01] Aria: So what happens on a client with 290kbps available and a 300kbps stream?
[06:01] RORgasm_: Aria: yeah...honestly i can see the case either way...thought there would be more consensus on the matter :)
[06:02] nmir: hoborick: this seems a bit strange, as it auto-generates form html? i was planning on using express-validator along with some sort of solution for rendering the errors back to the client
[06:02] bminer: Aria: you bump down to a 200kps stream  :)
[06:02] RORgasm_: Aria: i'm assuming that client will miss a few frames?
[06:02] RORgasm_: contributing to the choppiness of the video stream...?
[06:03] Aria: bminer: In realtime? At what changepoint? What does the client do? How do you know to slow down?
[06:03] Aria: RORgasm_: Video isn't transmitted in frames.
[06:03] Aria: RORgasm_: It's transmitted in long runs of b and d-frames that all depend on each other.
[06:03] RORgasm_: Aria:  i understand...i meant from the viewer's perspective
[06:03] bminer: Aria: all excellent questions that someone smarter than me has hopefully figured out and built into the RTMFP
[06:03] RORgasm_: lol
[06:03] Aria: bminer: I doubt it. It's codec-sensitive.
[06:04] Aria: Yeah, that's the thing. You don't miss frames. You miss huge globs of video and sound.
[06:04] bminer: Aria: of course... it's Adobe
[06:04] Aria: So what you probably want to do is buffer, pause, catch up, then resume.
[06:04] bminer: Aria: Unfortunately, Flash video has become a sort of de-facto standard for live video... Amazon CloudFront only seems to work with Flash Media Server... last I checked??
[06:05] HT has joined the channel
[06:05] Aria: bminer: One of many, many options.
[06:05] Aria: MPEG is much more common.
[06:05] RORgasm_: Aria: this is interesting http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP "But VoIP usually uses UDP not TCP because recovering from congestion through retransmission usually entails too much latency.[13] So QoS mechanisms can avoid the undesirable loss of VoIP packets by immediately transmitting them ahead of any queued bulk traffic on the same link, even when that bulk traffic queue is overflowing."
[06:06] RORgasm_: Aria: that's voice, not video...but interesting nonetheless :)
[06:06] Aria: Yes. VoIP is super latency sensitive. Also low enough bandwidth that it can be ignored most of the time.
[06:06] RORgasm_: i c
[06:06] Aria: You want impressive? Skype.
[06:06] chrisdickinson: falling under the category "better lost than late"?
[06:06] Aria: Yeah.
[06:06] RORgasm_: http://protocolinfo.org/wiki/Skype
[06:06] Aria: Its codecs are all adjustable in realtime. It slows, its speeds, it adapts to changing network speeds FAST.
[06:07] Aria: Plus their huge effort at just bypassing firewalls is impressive too.
[06:07] RORgasm_: apparently skype uses both UDP+TCP
[06:07] bminer: neat
[06:07] bminer: yeah Skype is a pretty nice solution to VoIP over the net
[06:08] bminer: I have had good luck with Google Voice, too, though
[06:08] bminer: unfortunately, I dunno how well it handles multicast video broadcasting
[06:08] bminer: (Skype that is)
[06:08] codygray has joined the channel
[06:08] Aria: It doesn't multicast.
[06:08] Aria: Ever.
[06:09] bminer: didn't think so
[06:09] bminer: 1-to-1 only then?
[06:09] Aria: Google Voice isn't VoIP, actually, at least not externally.
[06:09] RORgasm_: so they're probably sticking more to tcp then
[06:09] RORgasm_: more i think of it
[06:09] Aria: Yeah, 1-to-1. Conference, but mediated through a central party.
[06:09] RORgasm_: tcp makes more sense in what i was trying to do
[06:09] bminer: got it
[06:09] RORgasm_: coz i was trying to do a 1-on-1 thing too
[06:09] RORgasm_: wow

[06:18] halfhalo: Eh, for some reason I'm generally hesitant to make a full site out of node.  But I think I am going to use it to fully power a cloudfoundry/git web based management portal.
[06:18] RORgasm_: bminer: a static asset packaging thing? 
[06:19] bminer: Aria: things like Browserify....
[06:19] RORgasm_: Aria: btw i'm @harisamin on twitter...
[06:19] Aria: @aredridel here
[06:19] bminer: anything that will bundle assets nicely... CSS files, client-side JS, ...
[06:19] nmir has left the channel
[06:19] bminer: ideally deploy them to S3, etc.
[06:19] RORgasm_: Aria: hey...i know u...i think
[06:20] Aria: Oh, wow. Full stack stuff. Most node tools will do those sorts of things in parts, I think
[06:20] RORgasm_: Aria:  one sec :)
[06:20] SubStack: bminer: check out http://browserify.nodejitsu.com/
[06:20] halfhalo: mmm.... deploying a site directly from a git tag with integrated uglify-js...
[06:20] Aria: Yeah, I've been around a while, and ruby among other places, RORgasm_
[06:20] ShinyDarkness has joined the channel
[06:20] SubStack: ad-hoc browserify cdn
[06:21] RORgasm_: Aria: oh man
[06:21] SubStack: need to finish this design work so I can finish up stagecoach
[06:21] RORgasm_: Aria: not sure if you rememebr me... i'm @hamin on github... i used your smtp server library for my Kyatchi mail app https://github.com/aredridel
[06:21] SubStack: git deploys will be so nice
[06:21] Aria: Oh yeah!
[06:21] SubStack: Aria: you wrote an smtp server? :o
[06:21] RORgasm_: Aria:  http://hamin.github.com/kyatchi
[06:21] RORgasm_: :)
[06:21] Aria: SubStack: A library for it. Simple stuff.
[06:22] SubStack: I didn't find that in my survey of extant smtp libs
[06:22] halfhalo: stagecoach looks like fancy shit.  i like it.
[06:22] SubStack: so I wrote https://github.com/substack/node-smtp-protocol
[06:22] bminer: SubStack: thanks... I have been using Browserify... but it would be cool to auto-deploy everything, too. For example, I have assets like Stylus .styl files, .css files, client-side JS, Jade views...
[06:22] RORgasm_: Aria:  small world :)
[06:22] SubStack: halfhalo: super alpha though but you get the idea
[06:23] bminer: Maybe I want my pre-compiled Jade views to be available to the client... for use with Backbone.JS or something
[06:23] Aria: Hehe. That API looks pretty familiar, SubStack
[06:23] RORgasm_: bminer: Aria on a different topic... an iOS dev friend of mine and i released this iOS 5 app for iphone/ipad2 that about amonth ago
[06:23] RORgasm_: http://cyborgvisionapp.com
[06:23] RORgasm_: :)
[06:23] Aria: Spiffy!
[06:23] RORgasm_: give it a shot...some good ol' fashion terminator-style fun :)
[06:23] SubStack: Aria: I did get around to doing at least rudementary client sending
[06:23] SubStack: although it's missing some important stuff like tls upgrades
[06:23] RORgasm_: we hacked on it on video hackday and won 1t place and people's choice...and decided to move along and release it
[06:24] Aria: Yeah. Mine too.
[06:24] bminer: that's cool
[06:24] maletor has joined the channel
[06:25] bminer: SubStack: in development environments, I want these assets to have all debugging info and served locally.... in production, I want to serve these files from Amazon S3 with strong and weak caching.... and utilize URL fingerprinting
[06:25] halfhalo: SubStack: i may steal that for a develoment env for my work.  my current plan was just to use github hooks, but that only works for github.
[06:26] SubStack: Aria: yeah this is eerily similar
[06:26] SubStack: even the accept/reject api
[06:27] SubStack: wish I would have found it sooner >_<
[06:27] Aria: Hehe.
[06:27] Aria: Oops!
[06:27] RORgasm_: SubStack: when i wrote the Kyatchi node app, i just needed an smtp server lib...i think i came across yours but Aria's lib worked for my needs perfectly
[06:27] SubStack: Aria: the docs page was a bit hard to get to though
[06:27] SubStack: the one at http://dinhe.net/~aredridel/projects/js/node-smtp/doc/
[06:28] RORgasm_: i also did use someone else'se smtp parsing library
[06:28] Aria: Yeah. I need to revamp all that and just haven't had time.
[06:28] RORgasm_: man finding decent smtp parsing libs in pretty much any language suck
[06:28] RORgasm_: except for ruby
[06:28] halfhalo: cloudfoundry needs to support node 0.6.x and all will be well
[06:28] Aria: SMTP or MIME?
[06:28] bminer: I just use sendmail and nodemailer... am I a loser?
[06:28] RORgasm_: the mail gem in ruby is pretty freaking awesome...covers almost all of teh specifications that matter for mail
[06:28] mikeal has joined the channel
[06:28] RORgasm_: i guess MIME
[06:28] RORgasm_: :)
[06:29] RORgasm_: Aria:  so yeah i've been working on a desktop version of Kyatchi on and off using Macruby
[06:29] RORgasm_: really liking it
[06:29] RORgasm_: using the ruby mail gem for parsing
[06:29] maxogden: i wrote a mail app using haraka a while ago and was impressed by the thoroughness
[06:29] RORgasm_: email = Mail.parse(data) and BAM...i have all the parts that i need :)
[06:29] RORgasm_: maxogden: yeah i rememebr looking at harak
[06:29] RORgasm_: it lookded pretty good
[06:30] RORgasm_: i felt like it was a bit more heavy handed then what i needed as far as an smtp server goes
[06:30] Margle has joined the channel
[06:30] RORgasm_: maxogden:  Aria's lib was light and easy enough for me to grasp
[06:30] maxogden: RORgasm_: if you dont need streaming then node is kind of heavy handed :P cause Mail.parse(data) is way easier to program
[06:30] RORgasm_: lol
[06:31] SamuraiJack has joined the channel
[06:31] RORgasm_: maxogden: i was just inspired by http://mailcatcher.me which is writtein in Ruby/Eventmachine...i thought that node would eb a better impleemetnation...and it was...till i got ot the mime parsing bit :)
[06:31] RORgasm_: but really
[06:31] RORgasm_: i'm more excited about the macruby version that i've been working on
[06:31] RORgasm_: its fun :)
[06:32] RORgasm_: wrote the smtp server in plain on ruby instead of Obj-C...starting to like Obj-C..its atually pretty cool...but by no means am i way comfortable with it
[06:32] RORgasm_: but yeah
[06:32] RORgasm_: fun fun fun...i like me some GUMBO if you will :)

[07:40] Daegalus has joined the channel
[07:41] benvie: but if you compare them directly to each other then strict equals will be used since they're both strings and it won't be true

[07:42] hotroot: That's why I'm using ==

[09:26] booyaa: i'll it install it on my xp box at work
[09:26] booyaa: only briefly looked at it at home in a vm
[09:26] booyaa: just wanted to see if it would run.
[09:26] zomg: booyaa: well one guy does a decent'ish job, but another just does pretty much whatever he pleases and ignores coding standards, writes poor code, code that no one understands...
[09:26] zomg: commit messages which make no sense whatsoever
[09:27] zomg: I doubt our unit tests have passed (or completed for that matter) for months (I wrote like 95% of them in the first place)
[09:27] booyaa: zomg: yeah we had a guy who did that. the entire team suffers.
[09:27] zomg: Yeah it's fun when most of the time you're wondering what this code is really supposed to be doing
[09:27] booyaa: most of his applications are now considered proof of concept and are being rewritten
[09:27] zomg: Or why some line of code is commented out, whether it's supposed or not to... =)

[14:17] xerox: you'd have to put a middleware before the app.use of express.static
[14:17] jmar777: ^^
[14:17] xerox: wait, isn't app.router before that anyway
[14:17] pyparadigm: jmar777, for instance, I have it set to server static files, but there is this one JS file I want to handle manually with an app.get for instance and minify it first

[14:18] jetienne: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/Features/SPDY will be added to firefox 11 ... we *need* spdy support
[14:18] jmar777: pyparadigm: so you want the static file handler to serve the file, but you want another piece of middleware to minify it on the way out?
[14:19] pyparadigm: jmar777, yes
[14:19] pyparadigm: jmar777, I suppose minify it, then static serve it out
[14:20] ChiefWuki has joined the channel
[14:20] whitman has joined the channel
[14:20] jmar777: pyparadigm: so, basically what xerox said, but you'll still want to call `next()`. let me see if i can find a good example
[14:20] ChiefWuki: hey everyone
[14:20] xerox: I think it's much easier to serve the file from your route
[14:21] xerox: you are going to need to read it to minify it anyway!
[14:21] pyparadigm: jmar777, it works, thanks
[14:21] pyparadigm: jmar777, I just put next as parameter and called it after it was wrote to file
[14:21] ChiefWuki: does anyone have any good example of extending event.prototype
[14:21] pyparadigm: xerox, ty too btw
[14:22] VeXii has joined the channel
[14:22] ChiefWuki: sorry i meant EventEmitter
[14:22] lduros has joined the channel
[14:22] jmar777: xerox: can't minifying be done in a streaming way?
[14:23] jmar777: xerox: so you could stack the middleware w/ cache, minify, and then static middleware
[14:23] Rushing: what are the approaches to having multiple sites running on port 80?
[14:24] jmar777: xerox: actually i kind of take that back - i guess you can't minify while streaming, you'd have to buffer it, but having the minified version cached should negate the cost of that
[14:25] xerox: agreed
[14:26] jmar777: Rushing: use 0.8 :p
[14:26] ZeepZop has joined the channel
[14:26] xerox: 0.8 ???
[14:26] xerox: already
[14:26] jmar777: Rushing: right now it might be easiest to reverse proxy w/ nginx or similar. <=0.6 doesn't have great support for that
[14:27] jmar777: xerox: i was just joking - 0.8 will be the first stable branch with domain/isolates
[14:27] xerox: hah
[14:27] xerox: in 0.6 there is cluster
[14:27] kazupon has joined the channel
[14:27] metalball2 has joined the channel
[14:27] xerox: maybe one could hack it on top of that?
[14:28] jmar777: Rushing: in theory you can just bind a single server instance to port 80 (or a cluster, per xerox), and then inspect the host in the headers
[14:29] NetRoY has joined the channel
[14:29] Rushing: jmar777, yeah i thought about that, but then one site crashing would bring all of them down
[14:29] EhevuTov has joined the channel
[14:29] Rushing: ccapndave, so is webstorm just a subset of IDEA, or is webstorm better at the js intellisense?
[14:29] jmar777: Rushing: so i guess you could have several servers running on e.g., 3001, 3002, etc., and then have one instance running on 80 that proxies through to the "real" server
[14:30] jmar777: btw, are domains and isolates actually related? i always see them grouped together, so i've started assuming that different domains will run in their own isolate/context/thing. is that true?
[14:30] Rushing: thanks jmar777, that sounds like a good option
[14:30] ccapndave: Rushing: A subset; there is WebStorm, RubyMine, PhpStorm, etc, and IDEA is the big daddy that can install everything as plugins
[14:31] Rushing: cool, and how do you think it stacks up against aptana?
[14:31] ccapndave: Rushing: So the intellisense is identical
[14:31] ccapndave: Rushing: I gave up on Aptana ages ago :)

[14:42] doki_pen: thanks guys
[14:42] augustl: doki_pen: http://pastie.org/3010565
[14:42] augustl: that's how most promise libraries work
[14:42] doki_pen: wow, lots. any recommendations?
[14:42] augustl: a promise is just an object that lets outsiders observe "success" and "failure"
[14:42] k1ttty has joined the channel
[14:42] augustl: so it's a bit better than a plain callback since there's a standard way of differentiating success and failure
[14:43] doki_pen: augustl: but does doThings() take a callback?
[14:43] augustl: doki_pen: I'll show you, sec
[14:44] swaj: sigh, I hate the GPL.
[14:44] augustl: doki_pen: updated the pastie, http://pastie.org/3010565
[14:45] augustl: doki_pen: doThing can take a callback, that's up to you
[14:45] augustl: doki_pen: the important part is that you create a promise object, and call either resolve or reject on it
[14:45] augustl: when all the promises are ehtier resolved or rejected, myPromiseLib.all will trigger
[14:45] doki_pen: ah, cool
[14:45] augustl: so basically, myPromiseLib.all just listens for reject or resolve to be called
[14:46] swaj: I wish everything was MIT/BSD
[14:46] Poetro has joined the channel
[14:47] thomblake has left the channel

[15:05] Keto: =D
[15:05] Keto: every example i see is sending string
[15:05] tuhoojabotti: turn the array into json?
[15:06] Phlogistique: tuhoojabotti: it's an array of bytes!
[15:06] davidwalsh has joined the channel
[15:07] tuhoojabotti: Well perhaps something like base64 is better 8)

[15:07] tuhoojabotti: sounds like a buffer to me
[15:08] Keto: im tring to send between client/server
[15:08] einaros: right, well I added binary support to socket.io's websocket transports a month or so back

[15:09] einaros: Keto: if you want to do ArrayBuffer / FloatArray / etc sends right now, you could try my 'ws' module (https://github.com/einaros/ws)
[15:09] Skaag has joined the channel
[15:09] einaros: that is, until we bring it properly into socket.io / websocket.io
[15:09] nbaldwin has joined the channel
[15:10] joshkehn has left the channel
[15:10] tuhoojabotti: einaros: I knew your nick sounded familiar.
[15:10] einaros: 'ws' is mainly a websocket client / protocol implementation, but I've also added a server to it, so it should enable you to send arraybuffers to the latest chrome
[15:10] Keto: humm
[15:11] Keto: what about to convert it to a string, and then convert back to a array bytes?
[15:11] Keto: enconding in base64?
[15:12] einaros: sure, you can base64-encode it. it'll be slow as a fudge, though
[15:12] tuhoojabotti: Keto: It's all about speed and effiency
[15:12] tuhoojabotti: Depends on what you're doing
[15:12] Keto: so no encoding
[15:12] Keto: i need the faster solution
[15:12] tuhoojabotti: I'll probably use einaros' ws for my webgl game
[15:13] Keto: a guy in socket.io channel told me I can use socket.emit('test', [0x00, 0x01, 0xFF]);
[15:13] tuhoojabotti: that' will probably convert it to json
[15:13] tuhoojabotti: :P
[15:13] einaros: yep
[15:13] roger_raymond: tuhoojabotti: sorry, i think it's automatic when i'm away... let me check my settings
[15:13] tuhoojabotti: roger_raymond: Using /away is nice and subtle
[15:13] Keto: but will it work? slow?
[15:13] tuhoojabotti: Keto: Depends on what you're doing.
[15:13] tuhoojabotti: "sending data"
[15:13] einaros: it'll work (granted that you convert it back to an arraybuffer / whatever you need), but it'll be slow
[15:14] Keto: humm
[15:14] chia has joined the channel
[15:14] Keto: so, unless I use ws i cant make it fast
[15:15] Squeese has joined the channel

[15:15] einaros: ws was written to be very fast (and can round-trip 100MB of binary data in just over one second), but I haven't had time to expose a widely supported server for it

[16:14] booyaa: i tried to use this directly in a non-node.js related code and it got garbled.

[16:14] booyaa: eventually i found out these use this notation \u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u8a00 which is unicode?
[16:15] booyaa: then tuhoojabotti points out that unicode to html is just a case of replacing some characters i think it's the \uHEX with &#HEX;?
[16:15] tuhoojabotti: well
[16:15] booyaa: yeah to be honest i'm still confused...need to play around with this more
[16:15] augustl: sounds like you should work more with buffers and less with strings
[16:15] chia has joined the channel

[16:46] TimTimTim: quick question: i'm debating on converting everything serverside from php to node+socket.io because i'd like my apps to be realtime... the majority of the functionality/code is clientside, so only roughly 1000 lines of code serverside... i'm curious as to how feasible it would be to rewrite everything in node.js and what kinds of "gotchas" i would need to look out for
[16:46] fzzzy has joined the channel
[16:47] drudge: is anyone using mongoose express on railway?
[16:47] Industrial: well if its only 1000 lines, punch that sucker out and try it? :D
[16:47] TheJH: TimTimTim, you can write your own server code. also, everything is one big process, and currently, one big error makes the whole thing go down
[16:47] TheJH: TimTimTim, so be careful
[16:47] bradleymeck has joined the channel
[16:47] ank has joined the channel
[16:48] Rushing has joined the channel
[16:48] TheJH: TimTimTim, also, make sure not to make any mistakes that open security holes (you have the same problem in PHP, but with different things to watch for)
[16:49] TimTimTim: and i'm also wondering about whether or not i would have to rewrite a hefty portion of php's native functions in node.js, mainly things like array manipulation, string manipulation, file reading/writing, memcached, and mail functions
[16:49] brianthecoder has joined the channel
[16:49] TimTimTim: i'm sure there are some node.js libraries out there but i would prefer to keep everything to a minimum (don't want a bunch of extra fluff)
[16:49] Industrial: that's writing PHP in javascript then, right? :P Aren't you already doing thise things on the front end already with js?
[16:51] TimTimTim: well i'm not doing any file i/o, memcached, and mail client side
[16:52] TimTimTim: i mentioned array/string manip so maybe i can get a feel for where node.js stands with its native functions for all that

[16:54] bradleymeck: TimTimTim, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array
[16:54] Phlogistique: 17:52:21 < TimTimTim> i mentioned array/string manip <- this, you get the same as in the browser, plus underscore.js
[16:54] Phlogistique: (if you want underscore.js)
[16:54] chjj: TimTimTim: what are you asking exactly? what the php -> js conversion table would be?
[16:54] TimTimTim: ah ok, so nothing extra natively?
[16:55] chjj: TimTimTim: javascript is a really lightweight language actually
[16:55] Phlogistique: TimTimTim: yes there is some extra natively
[16:55] Phlogistique: but not on generic string/array stuff
[16:55] chjj: TimTimTim: php probably has a ton of functions more than js
[16:55] chjj: but theres nothing that cant be done
[16:56] bradleymeck: TimTimTim, you get stuff that is more modern than what you will see when you need to use browser cross compat, a lot has changed since IE6 but a lot of non JS gurus think you have to use IE6 style code
[16:56] TimTimTim: yeah php is way overkill for a lot of stuff but that's what makes it easier/quicker to knock out stuff here and there (sometimes)
[16:56] Phlogistique: now TimTimTim you _will_ need an external library for mail and memcached in node.js
[16:56] TimTimTim: Phlogistique: cool good to know thanks :)
[16:56] TimTimTim: i guess what i'm REALLY wondering is whether or not i should go ahead and convert everything to node.js or leave some as PHP and only use node.js for the realtime functionality
[16:57] chjj: yeah, i was specifically referring to string/array manipulation with what i said before
[16:57] zomgbie has joined the channel
[16:57] chjj: TimTimTim: i would say dont do the "node as a side dish" thing, but im biased
[16:57] Phlogistique: TimTimTim: one thing to know if you prolly do _not_ want to run node.js behind a reverse proxying apache
[16:58] TimTimTim: i'm leaning towards full conversion... likely more efficient than php plus easier to maintain, as i won't need to worry about what's what
[16:58] TimTimTim: yeah i'm using nginx
[16:58] TimTimTim: no apache
[16:58] chjj: ive seen a lot of people coming in here asking for help, the worst issues seem to occur when they do node as a side dish
[16:58] chjj: they have to come up with weird solutions to share php sessions with node
[16:58] chjj: etc

[18:47] perezd: excellent
[18:48] perezd: I see there is a way to configure node to ignore the $HOME/.npm 
[18:48] chrisdickinson: perezd: oh, that's one caveat.
[18:48] isaacs: perezd: npm cache clean
[18:48] perezd: yeah, I want it to never write a cache basically
[18:48] isaacs: perezd: you can configure the location of this cahce folde rwith the "cache" config
[18:48] perezd: yeah /dev/null
[18:48] isaacs: perezd: um.. not an option.
[18:48] isaacs: perezd: that's where it unpacks tarballs.
[18:48] isaacs: you cna't not have a cache.
[18:48] perezd: oh okay.

[18:49] franciscallo has joined the channel
[18:49] perezd: thx!
[18:49] chrisdickinson: isaacs: wait, a question: if you ``npm install`` in a dir with a package.json, and the dir above you has a ``node_modules`` dir, does it create a new, local node_modules, or does it install into the one above?
[18:49] chrisdickinson: if you're just typing npm install <somepackage> in that situation, it goes into the one above, but is the behavior different for package.json's?
[18:50] Nuck: Ugh.  Now that I actually want to try writing a unit test, I find that al the unit testing frameworks suck incredibly hard
[18:50] chrisdickinson: (i've never actually run into this problem, just sort of a thought experiment.)

[19:18] mmalecki: there's also iptables method

[19:24] brianc1: trose
[19:25] brianc1: i need to see the code
[19:25] brianc1: trose: usually what causes that is you're storing a reference to a client returned from pg.connect and using it outside the connect function.  
[19:26] chia has joined the channel
[19:26] trose: brianc1, actually.... yeah I think that's what happened
[19:26] Typo has joined the channel
[19:27] brianc1: trose: yeah, the client will "timeout" after a configurable delay. at this point the pool will close the client's socket, and throw it away
[19:27] trose: brianc1, okay so i should just wrap the offending code in a fresh connect callback and all should be well
[19:28] brianc1: trose: the right way is to always use pg.connect(...) for each new set of queries you want to run
[19:28] klatchbaldar: which npm now returns /usr/local/bin/npm
[19:28] pyparadigm: Anyone know of any projects trying to get the DB/Node/JS/DOM in sync with data?
[19:28] socketio\test\10 has joined the channel
[19:28] brianc1: trose: or you can create client instances directly by calling new pg.Client(/*same args as first arg to pg.connect*/)
[19:28] klatchbaldar: but npm returns -bash: /usr/bin/npm: No such file or directory
[19:28] trose: okay
[19:28] brianc1: trose: non pool-managed clients will never timeout & close
[19:28] klatchbaldar: how can I change the search path for npm?
[19:29] trose: brianc1, awesome
[19:29] isaacs: klatchbaldar: hash -r
[19:29] brianc1: trose: sometimes I think adding in connection pooling was a mistake & it should be handled outside the module
[19:29] isaacs: klatchbaldar: you just need to tell bash to reset its cache
[19:29] brianc1: trose: either way the pg.connect & pooling feature is entirely optional
[19:29] mmalecki: I hate bash caching so hard :/
[19:29] klatchbaldar: hash -r worked!
[19:29] trose: brianc1, hmm yeah, it confuses me a bit

[20:15] chrisdickinson: what's up?
[20:16] liamr: i written an https server using node and connect. i noticed it responds to regular http requests (any and all) with 200 and blank response.

[20:18] kickingvegas: liamr: if you're writing the server, you set the response code and whatever message you send back...
[20:19] liamr: tingham: that tutorial doesn't seem to answer my question.
[20:19] liamr: kickingvegas: and i do, for all https requests... but it doesnt seem to hit my routes when http is used instead
[20:19] liamr: perhaps it's something to do with using the connect module?
[20:20] devaholic: you want https/http to resolve to the same place?
[20:21] liamr: devaholic: not exactly - i want to handle http differently than https. currently if i make https requests to my app it works brilliantly, but if i make an http request it returns 200 and a blank response for all routes.
[20:21] liamr: i am trying to figure out how to handle the https requests.
[20:21] liamr: er
[20:21] liamr: the http requests
[20:22] devaholic: what port is the app listening on
[20:22] liamr: 4000
[20:22] devaholic: so what is in front of it

[20:28] devaholic: no one, make a gist that shows it?
[20:28] devaholic: is it in your schema?

[20:36] djMax: I don't really get why clearing would matter since I *think* I'm searching by id
[20:37] devaholic: its because you didnt have multi:true set, and you were using findOne, so you kept finding the first doc in your db which wasnt the one getting r set

[20:40] zomg: Or should this be served/specified preferably by something else
[20:40] zomg: I'm serving a bunch of images which never change so I could just tell the client to cache them forever
[20:40] djMax: I wonder if I have a different problem... Does console.log flush right away?
[20:40] devaholic: zomg: should probably land on a CDN eventually for web scale but i think express is fine for most use cases
[20:40] jesusabdullah: idk how to set cacheing time in connect's static middleware, but the one I wrote has adjustable cache time iirc

[20:41] Brandon: i keep hearing people say node should support amd
[20:41] isaacs: Brandon: asynchronous module definition
[20:41] Brandon: is it the processor?
[20:41] Brandon: oh
[20:41] zomg: devaholic: any idea how to specify the cache-control headers using express though?
[20:41] isaacs: Brandon: (it shouldn't)
[20:41] isaacs: :)
[20:41] devaholic: well you know what i mean... most projects wouldnt need it but eventually a cdn is the logical extreme
[20:41] zomg: Yeah
[20:41] isaacs: Brandon: it's the define("foo", ["bar", "baz"], function (bar, baz, require, exports, module) { … }) style of module definition

[20:42] liamr: devaholic: it still didnt work on 443 :/
[20:42] jesusabdullah: Brandon: No
[20:42] Brandon: other than the xxxsync functions
[20:42] isaacs: Brandon: right
[20:42] devaholic: zomg: search the express.js docs for cache
[20:42] isaacs: Brandon: other than the blahSync functions
[20:42] Brandon: yy
[20:42] jesusabdullah: and console.error is blocking right?
[20:42] devaholic: zomg: its there
[20:42] liamr: devaholic: if i request this with https, it hits my route. if i request http, it does not.
[20:42] isaacs: Brandon: node used to have an async require.  the thing is, it's kind of a pita to set up properly
[20:42] jesusabdullah: and console.log as of 0.6?
[20:42] zomg: devaholic: nothing useful :P I'll search again, perhaps I missed it
[20:43] devaholic: zomg: or use jesusabdullah's static thing 
[20:43] isaacs: and not really worht it, since setup phase is an ok time to do sync file io
[20:43] devaholic: zomg: really its in there though (in express)
[20:43] zomg: devaholic: is there some other docs for express besides the "guide" on expressjs.com? the guide talks only about a view cache
[20:43] devaholic: what about github examples
[20:44] devaholic: those are docs too
[20:44] zomg: Yeah didn't see anything about that either

[21:15] mikeal: SublimeText2 that is
[21:16] sechrist: yeah, 2, with the neat code window thing
[21:16] mikeal: that was my latest attempt to leave TM1
[21:16] devaholic: sublimetext2 is uber decent
[21:16] sechrist: TextMate?
[21:16] mikeal: it was almost there
[21:16] TheJH: mmalecki, tried gvim
[21:16] devaholic: faster than textmate
[21:16] sh1mmer: <3 vim
[21:16] purr: Let it be known that sh1mmer hearts vim.
[21:16] devaholic: you can actually use your mouse

[21:17] hotroot: http://xkcd.com/378/
[21:17] TheJH: mmalecki, do I also have a cursor there?
[21:17] mmalecki: or macvim, if you have a mac
[21:17] sechrist: I saw your tweet this morning.. the console command for it isn't working?
[21:17] sechrist: that's a simple wrapper lol
[21:17] mikeal: nothing was quite good enough
[21:17] mmalecki: TheJH: like, mouse cursor?
[21:17] Phlogistique: mmalecki: how better is it?
[21:17] chia has joined the channel
[21:17] sh1mmer: I have to admit I'm much happier with vim 7.3 in iterm2 than macvim
[21:17] TheJH: mmalecki, yes
[21:17] mikeal: all the little things in TM1 that made my workflow so much smoother
[21:17] hotroot: That xkcd link explains the real best editor =P
[21:17] mikeal: i love iterm2
[21:17] brianc1: can your editor do this: https://github.com/qdot/deldo
[21:17] TheJH: mmalecki, also, I wasn't able to figure out how to copy/paste yet
[21:17] sechrist: butterflies
[21:17] sh1mmer: mikeal: really? I've been feeling that way about vim
[21:17] gkatsev: sh1mmer: can't you use macvim in the terminal?
[21:18] mmalecki: TheJH: if you :set mouse=a
[21:18] devaholic: some things in sublimetext2 are too complicated when they could be simple, like searching
[21:18] devaholic: bit of a turn off
[21:18] sh1mmer: gkatsev: macvim is a windowed implementation of grim 7.3
[21:18] devongovett_ has joined the channel
[21:18] mmalecki: TheJH: hah :). you delete with d and copy with y
[21:18] mikeal: i use vi instinctively in command line, but as an editor it's not optimized for large project editing and writing a lot of code quickly
[21:18] TheJH: also, best editor EVER: http://hackertyper.com/ - unbelivable typing speed :)
[21:18] mmalecki: Phlogistique: how what is better?
[21:18] sh1mmer: gkatsev: I prefer the CLI version with xterm-256
[21:18] TheJH: try it :D
[21:18] mikeal: it's the greatest sys admin editor in the history of the world
[21:18] context: HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA !
[21:18] context: brianc1: holy shit !
[21:18] gkatsev: sh1mmer: ok, I thought that it added apple key support to terminal vim and made the gui for mac.
[21:19] context: brianc1: does emacs have a text editor yet htough?
[21:19] brianc1: context: I know. as if I needed another reason to stop using emacs.
[21:19] sechrist: I like the fact that sublime text 2 is cross platform
[21:19] sh1mmer: gkatsev: nah. but iterm2 makes up a lot of those things pretty well
[21:19] sh1mmer: and then you get consistency on/off machine
[21:19] KBM has left the channel
[21:19] sechrist: but everybody has a mac these days
[21:19] gkatsev: ok, good to know if I ever develop on OSX

[21:19] mikeal: sechrist: that would be important if it was a factor for me, but it's not, i never edit code not on mac
[21:19] TheJH: mmalecki, where can you code faster, vim or http://hackertyper.com/ ? :D
[21:19] mikeal: it's like features in ES5
[21:19] mikeal: i only write node, so i just use them

[21:22] gkatsev: also, it's more mouse friendly since version 3 which came out with ff4
[21:22] sechrist: with terms that support it, you can use a mouse in vim
[21:22] mikeal: and i'll be the happiest person in the world
[21:22] brianc1: mikeal: does the lion "delay" when switching full screen apps bother you? drives me crazy. 
[21:23] sh1mmer: mikeal: I'm addicted to iterm2 fullscreen, split into 3 cols on my thunderbolt display 
[21:23] mikeal: not really
[21:23] sh1mmer: it's hotness
[21:23] mikeal: it's still faster than the context switch my head makes when bringing a window to the foreground
[21:23] isaacs: JasonSmith: hey, is there any way to tell follow to pause for a sec?
[21:23] sechrist: sh1mmer: 3 columns as separate terms?

[21:27] TheJH: isaacs, if you use small screens, you should like coco or so because of the compact syntax :D
[21:27] mikeal: with split view, i trick myself in to thinking i don't need to keep the code in one pane in my head while i read the other
[21:27] isaacs: TheJH: i like javascript, too
[21:27] mikeal: and this is not true, i need to keep that code in my head and use it as context for the code i'm reading
[21:27] mikeal: split view tricks my brain, so i don't use it

[21:28] shawnjan: so I have a Node.js proxy server running, and I had some crazyness where there would be a POST request with a 302 response, and then a GET request. the response for the POST would come back, but the request for the GET would just hang
[21:28] mmalecki: sechrist: http://i.imgur.com/R1949.jpg
[21:28] mmalecki: it's a win/win
[21:28] sechrist: ahhh
[21:28] shawnjan: when I set "close" on the connection header everything was fine
[21:28] shawnjan: any help would be appreciate :)
[21:28] mikeal: shawnjan: were you handling the GET?
[21:28] shawnjan: also may be a bug
[21:29] shawnjan: yep
[21:29] shawnjan: @mikeal yep
[21:29] mikeal: so, in node.js server, the keep alive is transparent
[21:29] mikeal: the parser will emit a new request event
[21:29] mikeal: you won't even really know that it's the same socket
[21:30] mikeal: so my guess is that something else is happening, at the application layer
[21:30] shawnjan: hmmm
[21:30] shawnjan: I mean I would immediately put a console log statement at the beginning of my request handler, and would recieve nothing for that GET

[21:48] joshontheweb: http-proxy rather
[21:48] springmeyer has joined the channel
[21:48] joshontheweb: is bouncy the way to go, maybe I didn't give a fair try

[21:52] mmalecki: joshontheweb: hm, that's possible
[21:53] mmalecki: I can describe the bug we've had if you want to
[21:53] joshontheweb: mmalecki please

[21:53] lduros has left the channel
[21:53] mmalecki: so, basically, new protocol doesn't need any body when client responds to an UPGRADE
[21:54] mmalecki: there's a bug in http.js which loses all empty messages - they simply don't get send out
[21:54] mmalecki: we have a workaround, which forces these messages to be flushed
[21:55] mmalecki: but it may not work now. idk, really
[21:55] joshontheweb: yeah, that fits what I was experiencing
[21:55] mmalecki: I should prolly sit with a tcpdump

[21:55] mmalecki: joshontheweb: I can link you to the issue.
[21:55] mmalecki: TheJH: yes.

[21:55] TheJH: mmalecki, it's that hard to track down?

[22:46] Marak: i take it, pgreiss client is not supported anymore? or it doesnt have latest ws spec?
[22:47] sh1mmer: Marak: I don't think he's worked on that in a year
[22:47] sh1mmer: Marak: afaik he doesn't do any node at FB
[22:47] mmalecki_: if pgreiss client == the one we have in node-http-proxy, then it's outdated as fuck

[22:50] gkatsev: you can shebang it in the script, probably
[22:50] TimTimTim: what do you mean
[22:50] gkatsev: not sure how it changes the semantics of how you do some of the stuff
[22:50] jhurliman: ryah, is isolates2 the branch you were telling me about that helps with enumerating all of the current watchers and getting stack traces for them?
[22:50] gkatsev: TimTimTim: #!/usr/bin/bash  but instead you point to node. something like that
[22:50] timbl has joined the channel
[22:51] caioketo: I tried to instal that ws thing with "npm install ws" but it crashes
[22:51] TimTimTim: oh ok... and that will make it automatically start every time my server restarts?
[22:51] jhurliman: gkatsev, i think he was asking how to keep a node app running all of the time (presumably across reboots)
[22:51] ryah: jhurliman: no - domains
[22:51] jhurliman: ah n/m
[22:51] gkatsev: jhurliman: yeah, probably
[22:51] caioketo: can someone help me with that?
[22:52] gkatsev: TimTimTim: never mind, you want to write an upstart script or something like that that will run your app on restart

[23:50] euforic: sdwrage yes it reads the data fine
[23:51] euforic: sdwrage yes it reads the data fine
[23:51] sdwrage: euforic: so I could store it in a var and use it to do http.write on that data?
[23:51] Sembiance: Anyone have a favorite logger module they want to recommend?
[23:51] shawnjan: the issue was that i created a proxy server in node, we use the proxy server to inject some stuff into our HTML for development purposes. we have one very specific problem where we proxy through a POST request, which returns a 302 to the browser, and the 302 contains a location to some URL, and this request hangs
[23:52] hotroot: Anyone here used sqlite3 in node? Little confused about callbacks
