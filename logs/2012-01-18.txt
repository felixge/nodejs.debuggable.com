[00:14] cmwelsh has joined the channel
[00:15] jowop: basically my issue is that my loadbalancer does not do layer7 checks. i want to make a HTTP request to a server when a new connection is opened to my node.js server. if the HTTP request is successful, i want to accept the connection, if not, reject it. that way my loadbalancer will be able to determine the result of the layer7 request

[00:18] jowop: nginx will continue to accept connections even if HTTP requests are not being served out in a timely manner. so my loadbalancer will return a false positive. so i want to have nodejs make sure that HTTP requests are being served out in a timely manner, if not, do not accept TCP connections
[00:19] jowop: i mean i guess i can have the nodejs server poll my nginx server and close() when needed, but it seems like it would be easier to just check on every TCP connection from the loadbalancer

[00:34] niftylettuce has joined the channel
[00:34] whatadewitt: right now i'm just trying to have users load a page, and each time a user loads the page, i want to emit a message from the server that will just indicate that a new users is visiting the site

[00:36] whatadewitt: that was supposed to be "on" that emit 
[00:36] cmr: Right
[00:36] whatadewitt: so it's pringing out "new user joined"

[02:28] secoif: technel each function you supply to async.parallel needs to fire a callback
[02:29] secoif: technel otherwise how does it know the async function is completed?

[03:29] secoif: bah
[03:29] lwille: your sample works fine here
[03:29] xbayrockx: How did you test it ?
[03:30] secoif: xbayrockx perhaps you're not running latest node, or latest socket.io?
[03:30] westc: */
[03:30] westc: how do you make comments in the irc
[03:30] lwille: xbayrockx just pasted the code from http://socket.io/#how-to-use
[03:30] xbayrockx: v0.6.7
[03:30] apwalk_ has joined the channel
[03:31] xbayrockx: That's my version of Node, and socket came with it
[03:31] lwille: the only thing I changed is the port number
[03:31] westc: xbayrockx: STOP polluting the channel with your immature questions that can be answered via learning the foundations of JS
[03:31] xbayrockx: So how do you know that it worked?
[03:32] westc: the name of the channel is not #spoonfeed.node.js
[03:32] lwille: :D
[03:32] lwille: nice @westc
[03:32] xbayrockx: I commented that there was no single example of basic Socket.IO code that worked
[03:33] lwille: well, you maybe should have done this in #socket.io
[03:33] xbayrockx: I invite you to try and receive a response there
[03:33] lwille: but as I just told you, the samples are working fine
[03:34] westc: xbayrockx: not to be rude but programming in general involves a certain amount of cleverness. without that...you're going to have issues
[03:34] westc: assuming you already have a solid foundation of the language you're working with
[03:34] westc: if you don't even have that then forget it
[03:35] jetienne__ has joined the channel
[03:35] mfunkie: Samples worked fine for me, changed the port is the only thing
[03:35] xbayrockx: I changed to http://localhost/socket.io/socket.io.js and it seems to work
[03:36] xbayrockx: Why would that be?
[03:36] secoif: xbayrockx what did you change it from?>
[03:36] xbayrockx: As in, I thought my code should work as is, given that it came from Socket.IO website
[03:36] xbayrockx: socket.io/socket.io.js
[03:36] secoif: oh
[03:36] secoif: yeah that wasn't going to work
[03:37] lwille: well, at least in your pastie the url was correct :)
[03:37] maletor has joined the channel
[03:37] secoif: xbayrockx I believe the js file contains some smarts as to how to connect to your socket server, isn't just a static js file

[03:38] xbayrockx: oh
[03:38] secoif: xbayrockx so the example WAS working, just not how you intended
[03:39] xbayrockx: so they give me code, but didnt tell me that that i run the "client" code on my pc?
[03:39] lwille: nope, the file is just static, but socket.io only registers a handler for that exact url.
[03:39] xbayrockx: that i dont*
[03:39] secoif: lwille ahh
[03:39] secoif: that makes sense.
[03:39] MrTopf has joined the channel
[03:39] lwille: that's why you give the "app" object to socket.io
[03:40] lwille: you can change the path though, but I'd always rather stick to the conventions

[03:44] westc: where's catb0t

[03:45] secoif: and it's probably just evidence that socketio needs better documentation
[03:45] westc: secoif++
[03:45] alystair: what's the recommended site for pasting stuff, pastebin.ca isn't resolving 50% of time
[03:45] secoif: alystair i use gist so it's easy to track the pastes down again later
[03:46] lwille: well, I think they can assume that the user knows that a) he's using a network protocol b) this protocol is HTTP which is c) normally handled via a browser
[03:47] secoif: alystair perhaps you need to set up local dns

[06:04] LuckySMack: ah ok, thanks Shaunzie 
[06:05] Shaunzie: jas_a: if an instance of Error is being thrown, you'll want to catch and handle it.
[06:05] pradeebv has joined the channel
[06:05] Shakir: how can
[06:08] jas_a: Shaunzie: i'm reading this on stack overflow: "Though these methods mean that you're app is still throwing exceptions, rather than just creating and passing them. Throwing exceptions is considered bad practice."
[06:08] jas_a: Shaunzie: i've read it other places as well, so i'm wondering am i doing something wrong?
[06:08] Shaunzie: yah, you should throw Error because if uncaught, node dies, which is kinda bad for business.
[06:09] Shaunzie: It's much better to pass an error as a parameter in a callback
[06:09] Shaunzie: ie function(err, …)
[06:09] Shaunzie: you can gracefully handle that without worrying about node dying on you.
[06:10] Shakir: I found an error in express cann't not found connect after install express
[06:11] omenar has joined the channel

[06:14] Shaunzie: jas_a: ok, well just because you are passing errors, does not mean that the packages you are using do.

[06:19] Shaunzie: jas_a: yah, it's throwing an error. But that kind of problem can be avoided easily. Before executing that line of code, you need to make sure that your application is providing actual data.
[06:20] jas_a: Shaunzie: ok. just doing input validation

[06:21] duko2: hi im wondering if there is a preferred way of organising a node.js project
[06:21] descipher has joined the channel
[06:21] duko2: one that re-uses the same templates for backend and client-side rendering
[06:22] Shaunzie: duko2: I think express is the defacto framework for node.js, so most people follow the setup that it generates by default.
[06:24] jas_a: Shaunzie: thanks for your help
[06:24] jas_a: got to go
[06:24] Shaunzie: jas_a: np
[06:24] duko2: express does not have a default setup for the sort of application i described

[06:27] shadowshell has joined the channel
[06:27] duko2: there's nothing special about that
[06:28] Shaunzie: makes views, public and routes are why gets created with express. that should be enough
[06:30] duko2: if you are using your view templates on the client
[06:30] duko2: those would go in 'public'
[06:31] Shaunzie: duko2: not necessarily. No reason why you couldn't expose additional directories when you create the server
[06:31] duko2: that's true :|

[06:32] domino14: ugh.. i don't understand how to use "next" in express for error checking
[06:32] domino14: i do return next(new Error("error")) but it seems that if it's in a nested function, it breaks out of the nested function and just ocntinues executing
[06:32] Shakir: Hey, I want Express IDE for windows
[06:33] domino14: how do i like … raise an error and return that error to the user?
[06:33] Shaunzie: Shakir: You'd have to make one.
[06:33] Shaunzie: domino14: you wouldn't raise an error. Error object = bad
[06:34] Shaunzie: domino14: check out http://expressjs.com/guide.html#req.flash()
[06:34] Shaunzie: ehl…. wtf did he put parens in the id…. -.-
[06:34] Shaunzie: if your irc client fails and making a link copy paste ._.
[06:35] Shakir: but on that adderss is express module
[06:37] domino14: Shaunzie: what does that mean .. what's a flash msg?
[06:37] domino14: and why is raising an Error object bad?
[06:37] Shaunzie: domino14: allows you to store a message in session the user's session to be retrieved later.
[06:38] Shaunzie: domino14: uncaught errors will cause node to die.
[06:38] Shaunzie: domino14: accidentally killing your server is bad for business >.>

[12:16] Lingerance: You can make sure it's correct though, with .bind(), .call() or .apply() (all members of Function)

[15:43] baudehlo: why do you want to call myFunc async?
[15:44] meso has joined the channel
[15:45] megalomix: baudehlo, only to understand how to create an async function
[15:45] tjfontaine: megalomix: fwiw there are existing libraries that will let you iterate an array (among other things) asynchronously
[15:45] megalomix: tjfontaine, yes but it is not my scope...i only would like to undersatnd if node CALLs it async
[15:45] tjfontaine: megalomix: no, simply passing a function isn't sufficient enough to count as async
[15:45] megalomix: OR do i have to use process.nextTick() ?
[15:45] dannyamey has joined the channel
[15:45] megalomix: tjfontaine, ah ok understand
[15:45] baudehlo: megalomix: ok. Well async is only important if you're doing I/O, in which case pretty much everything in the node core will take care of that for you.
[15:45] brianloveswords has joined the channel
[15:46] aliem has joined the channel
[15:46] megalomix: ok

[15:47] nibblebot has joined the channel
[15:47] jonbaer has joined the channel
[15:47] baudehlo: process.nextTick() just gives the event loop chance to do something else. But most uses of it are an anti-pattern.
[15:48] megalomix: ah ok
[15:48] bnoordhuis: unless you're calculating fibonacci numbers
[15:48] megalomix: :)
[15:48] Glenjamin: heh
[15:49] Glenjamin: or doing something compuationally expensive in the main loop
[15:49] megalomix: i'm trying to implement a call AFTER the loop is finished....but i'm also using MYSQL module....it is async so i can't know "Perfectly" when all the job is done
[15:49] Glenjamin: which could include normal tasks like producing a CSV file for a large dataset
[15:49] npa has joined the channel
[15:49] baudehlo: even if you're doing something computationally expensive, it's probably *still* an anti-pattern.
[15:50] booo has joined the channel
[15:50] baudehlo: process.nextTick() is just going to cost you more CPU cycles.

[15:50] Glenjamin: my personal favourite is http://github/com/caolan/async

[15:51] kevwil has joined the channel
[15:51] Glenjamin: but sometimes nextTick is the path of least resistance
[15:51] megalomix: wait
[15:51] monk12: I did a console.dir on 'oop' var/function, and seems like its not there. i guess his cold is old on the website. not sure what i need to do to make the example work
[15:51] monk12: his code*
[15:51] pietern has joined the channel
[15:52] megalomix: nextTick gives the possibility to node to do other stuff, why spend more CPU ?
[15:52] baudehlo: monk12: it's in util.
[15:52] tjfontaine: baudehlo: he's using some 3rd party module it seems
[15:53] dannyamey has joined the channel
[15:53] baudehlo: megalomix: because creating a closure for nextTick() to run, and calling nextTick() and getting back into the event loop, none of that is free.

[16:38] ryanrolds: bradleymeck: each of those modules should keep their own dependicies.

[16:38] jaequery has joined the channel
[16:38] bradleymeck: true, but a reference of X from A will not match the catch entry of the reference of X in B
[16:39] bradleymeck: so if you are trying to monkey patch something, or you want to store something (singleton based things like configs / logs) you need to be aware of that
[16:39] turrican_: seems The-M-Project want's to use cygwin
[16:39] ryanrolds: Sucks to be The-M-Project.

[17:12] MadGu1 has joined the channel
[17:12] unomi: How do you guys feel about faye on node?

[17:12] stonebra_ has joined the channel

[17:14] MadGu1: Hi all ! I'm trying to stress test a nodejs/socket.io application, usually I use curl-loader for this task, but this tool didn't yet support web socket load test. 
[17:14] clutchski: bradleymeck: but that's still sort of state no? what happens when a webserver goes down that has a websocket connection? there's work to do to get that user seamlessly connected on a different server no?
[17:14] unomi: bradleymeck: does the bayeux protocol add anything beyond what socket.io achieves?
[17:15] bradleymeck: clutchski, thats the same as ajax?
[17:15] bradleymeck: you shouldnt tie a transaction to an incomplete communication
[17:15] MadGu1: Is there someone already do something like this ?
[17:15] unomi: I picked the wrong day to do research on the interwebs it seems
[17:15] clutchski: well, usually a load balancer will handle that right and ideally you can bring web servers up and down willy nilly. how does that work with web sockets?
[17:15] bradleymeck: clutchski, the connection is killed, like it should be
[17:16] bradleymeck: clutchski, if a websocket dies, just reconnect, if you are not keeping a message queue there are a whole slew of problems that are bigger than unreliable network
[17:16] joshthecoder: if the client is graceful at handling disconnects and auto-reconnecting shouldn't be an issue.
[17:16] bradleymeck: unomi not to my knowledge
[17:16] clutchski: oh ok. so maybe it's not as challenging as i think. do you think there are any extra operational challenges with websockets as opposed to plain old http?
[17:17] MadGu1: yes normally client reconnect after a 10 seconds timeout
[17:17] unomi: clutchski: for the most part, unless you are leveraging something like persevere2, you will need to manage that yourself, ie, a queue / distribution network that your socket.io solution communicates through
[17:17] pdodde has joined the channel
[17:17] MadGu1: no use haproxy for that

[18:45] ouch: AndreasMadsen seriously dont get ya, but im sure its me :S

[19:42] wdbl: it seems like every core js file in node calls array.slice by doing Array.prototype.slice.call(target, n); Does anyone know why that single function is called that way, but other Array functions are called like normal? Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty seems to be another one that is always called like this too...
[19:42] wdbl: there's even this -  Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0).filter(f);
[19:42] jerrysv: wdbl: arguments is "special"
[19:42] litropy_ has joined the channel
[19:43] EhevuTov has joined the channel
[19:43] insin: to call it with the given argument as "this", in the case of slice because you're dealing  with an Array-like which isn't an Array
[19:43] jerrysv: it's not a true array, but can act like one. that just calls Array's slice to convert it into a real array, using "arguments" as "this"
[19:43] wdbl: ok, what about all the calls to Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(target, prop) then?
[19:43] soapyillusions has joined the channel
[19:44] wdbl: (thx btw, I do see that most of those slice.calls are made for "arguments"!)

[19:44] jerrysv: i'm blanking on that one too, sorry
[19:45] igl: in case of a empty proto object from Object.create() probably

[19:51] wdbl: insin: I understand what call and apply do, I was just wondering _why_ they were being used where they were being used since I thought that arguments was a normal array and that all object instances had the "hasOwnProperty" method.

[20:21] janekp: i have some extra setup code before node::Start (and it runs on another thread) + i load my custom module there too
[20:22] wdbl: oh because I'm experimenting with node + GUI on Windows, but linking to node didn't appeal to me.
[20:22] cognominal___ has joined the channel
[20:22] janekp: why?
[20:22] wdbl: I was using it to just run the JS in it's own process and let it control the GUI from there.
[20:22] janekp: on mac/linux static linking is a viable solution too
[20:23] ph^ has joined the channel
[20:23] wdbl: because I'm not doing my GUI stuff in C/C++ on Windows.
[20:23] janekp: im using only 1 process. On mac u cant even run GUI from another thread
[20:24] janekp: so you either have to launch another process or hack node

[20:25] wdbl: *nice 
[20:25] tjfontaine: I can only take credit for pasting the url, the rest is TooTallNate's
[20:25] janekp: well, my use-case is a bandwidth intensive app (large images, videos). Pure web approach isn't still optimal. So the idea is to write it like a web-app, but run it locally
[20:25] wdbl: janekp: same here
[20:26] jerrysv: isaacs: you'd better hope nodesummit has fast net access, and doesn't suffer what nodeconf did :)
[20:26] isaacs: for real
[20:26] wdbl: janekp: so, I wanted to run my JS code in the same process as my GUI code too and since embedding Node wasn't an option for me, I'm sort of emulating node's JS API now instead.
[20:27] xpigeonx: is there a simple thread-pool producer-consumer library for node?

[20:28] janekp: yes!se)
[20:28] janekp: thats my idea
[20:28] wdbl: janekp: To do that, I'm doing it one way on Windows and a different way on Mac
[20:28] context: avianflu: hahaha
[20:28] janekp: i realized that simple nodeJS module is not good enough for that
[20:29] janekp: so thats why i want to use node as a lib
[20:29] wdbl: on Mac, I will use WebView/JSCore to execute the JS
[20:29] wdbl: just because I have code for that already, but I might be interested in your code too
[20:29] janekp: i plan to put it on github after i clean it up
[20:29] wdbl: sweet
[20:30] janekp: current version works like this: node-ui script.js 
[20:30] janekp: and when i run it
[20:30] janekp: from terminal
[20:30] janekp: an icon is created and added to Dock
[20:30] janekp: so it works like a normal app
[20:30] janekp: and like a normal node script too

[20:32] wdbl: I am working on a common JS API to abstract all of that
[20:33] wdbl: then the native implementation can do whatever it has to, in order to emulate that

[20:44] zomg: At least with git, you just checkout the tag for the version you want and compile
[20:44] swaj: what do you mean update?
[20:44] zomg: There is also nvm
[20:45] swaj: or you can download the tgz and compile it yourself: http://nodejs.org/dist/node-v0.4.12.tar.gz

[20:48] xpigeonx: ask again, anyone familiar with process.bind ? I see it occur in various source modules, but can't find it in the api anywhere
[20:48] joshsmith: ergh, I just reinstalled with the package
[20:48] bradleymeck: xpigeonx, there is no process.bind, process.binding is native C++ parts of node
[20:48] joshsmith: it's not in my PATH again
[20:49] xpigeonx: bradleymeck: what does process.binding do then?
[20:49] swaj: I'm digging the cluster api changes in 0.7.0 :)
[20:49] Hebo: swaj: link?
[20:49] isaacs: xpigeonx: process.binding is the function that returns the natively built c++ bits.
[20:50] swaj: Hebo: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.7.0/api/cluster.html
[20:50] isaacs: xpigeonx: ie, the code in node's src/ folder.
[20:50] Hebo: ty
[20:50] isaacs: xpigeonx: you should not use process.binding in your program. ever.
[20:50] isaacs: xpigeonx: it's not documented in the API because you're not supposed to touch it under any circumstances.
[20:51] isaacs: xpigeonx: to learn how it works, you must read the code.  then you must ask node-core devs who will tell you not to do it.  then you must slay no fewer than 3 dragons.
[20:51] bradleymeck: only use it if you are tied to the version number, and even then you will regret it, but sometimes you have to
[20:51] JJMalina has joined the channel
[20:51] isaacs: bradleymeck: no, even then.
[20:51] xpigeonx: I want a pipe, and var Pipe = process.binding('pipe_wrap').Pipe; seems kinda like what i want
[20:52] isaacs: bradleymeck: if you think you need to use process.binding, then you actually need to post a bug.
[20:52] insin: they removed the "complete nethack without eating any food" requirement? When did core go soft?
[20:52] isaacs: xpigeonx: what are you trying to do?
[20:52] bradleymeck: isaacs, i use it to monkey patch things to prevent the "real" binding from being called
[20:52] isaacs: bradleymeck: that is extremely hazardous.
[20:52] alessioalex: how do I debug a segmentation fault in Node.js?
[20:52] isaacs: bradleymeck: i think it voids the warranty.
[20:52] mmalecki: bradleymeck: only in 0.4, right?
[20:52] bradleymeck: isaacs, correct and the only sane way to do it

[20:54] alessioalex: gdb node app.js .. ?
[20:54] isaacs: xpigeonx: why isn't child_process.spawn or child_process.fork acceptable to you?
[20:54] isaacs: xpigeonx: use the documented api.
[20:54] isaacs: xpigeonx: it can do that
[20:54] mmalecki: maybe because .fork is broken :/
[20:54] bnoordhuis: alessioalex: `gdb --args out/Debug/node app.js`, then `run`, then `backtrace full` when it crashes
[20:54] isaacs: mmalecki: it is not broken.
[20:55] joshkehn has joined the channel
[20:55] isaacs: mmalecki: it just requires that you run your program with node, and not some other thing.
[20:55] alessioalex: thanks
[20:55] bnoordhuis: alessioalex: you'll want to compile a debug build, the stack traces from a release build aren't always useful
[20:55] mmalecki: isaacs: it has no features.
[20:55] kuebk has joined the channel
[20:55] isaacs: mmalecki: it has the feature that the children can do work, and communicate with the paretn.

[20:55] praCt: bnoordhuis, im looking at some valve docs (specifically rcon source), and its say "The protocol is based around command/response packets encapsulated in a TCP/IP stream", im not too certain dgram udp would make good fit or am i missing something?
[20:55] isaacs: mmalecki: it lacks *one* feature, which you've decided you can't live without.
[20:56] isaacs: mmalecki: but that's not the same as having "no features"
[20:56] pyrotechnick: STOP SOPA has done more damage than SOPA itself
[20:56] bnoordhuis: praCt: oh, maybe valve games do it over tcp. quake 3's rcon is udp based though
[20:56] xpigeonx: @isaacs: child_process lets you send a message to a child, I'd rather have the children 'wake up' once a condition variable is set to let free ones know theres is more work

[20:57] praCt: bnoordhuis: i see, hmm i guess ill try it, and hopefully get some kind of response. 
[20:58] xpigeonx: @isaacs: is 0.7 stable or still in development, the latest download on the side is 0.6.7
[20:58] bnoordhuis: alessioalex: you'll have to compile it first, of course
[20:58] mmalecki: isaacs: hm, my patch was agains master, iirc
[20:58] isaacs: mmalecki: and even there, you can use the (internal, undocumented) std*Stream stuff
[20:58] isaacs: xpigeonx: 0.7 is unstable.
[20:58] boltR has joined the channel
[20:58] robde_ has joined the channel
[20:58] isaacs: xpigeonx: the stable counterpart will be 0.8
[20:58] isaacs: xpigeonx: which is when the api will be frozen.
[20:58] isaacs: likely in a month or two.
[20:59] xpigeonx: @isaacs: I also couldn't find isolates in 0.7 api
[20:59] isaacs: if you'er in development, and not releasing tomorrow, i'd recommend using 0.7
[20:59] mmalecki: isaacs: frozen forever or just for 0.8, like usual?
[20:59] isaacs: mmalecki: yes, that's the pattern.
[20:59] isaacs: mmalecki: then there'll be 0.8
[20:59] isaacs: er, then there'll be 0.9
[20:59] isaacs: which will freeze in either 1.0 or 0.10, not sure yet.
[20:59] isaacs: that's a ways off.
[21:00] mmalecki: isaacs: ah. I thought you ment like forever

[21:01] harthur has joined the channel
[21:01] isaacs: xpigeonx: using process.binding in your program is perhaps the worst thing you can do.  *at best* it shows that there's something we haven't addressed properly.

[21:04] bnoordhuis: wdbl: yes
[21:04] isaacs: xpigeonx: yeah, so, all overstatement aside.. if you find a process.binding that does what you need, you need to seek further information.  at least, it's a bug or a missing bit of api that we have to add, and we need to know about it.
[21:05] wdbl: ok just making sure my understanding is correct after having dove into the node code for a week or so...thx
[21:05] isaacs: xpigeonx: and there's a good chance that there's some public api that does what you want in a more stable manner.
[21:06] mmalecki: isaacs: so, we have to use it to detect on what port user decided to listen and to override it if there's a collision
[21:06] infynyxx has joined the channel
[21:07] mmalecki: isaacs: hints :) ?
[21:07] isaacs: why do you need to do that?  why not let them get an error?
[21:08] isaacs: mmalecki: if i say i want to listen on port 12356, and then i'm instead listening on 9239, then that's a problem, i think.
[21:08] jesusabdullah: isaacs: It's to spite you
[21:08] mmalecki: isaacs: we'd have to define a port user has to listen on, we don't want to
[21:08] joshwines has joined the channel
[21:09] isaacs: mmalecki: why not?

[21:09] Heisenmink_ has joined the channel
[21:09] isaacs: env.PORT or some such.
[21:09] mmalecki: isaacs: hm, no. that allows for only one port

[21:10] mmalecki: isaacs: so, I was thinking, make net an EventEmitter, maybe?
[21:10] isaacs: env.PORT0 env.PORT1 env.PORT2, ... env.PORT20
[21:11] isaacs: you get to listen on those ones.
[21:11] mmalecki: isaacs: that's ghetto
[21:11] tjfontaine: env.PORT.split(',')
[21:11] isaacs: and hijacking process.binding("net") isn't?

[21:11] isaacs: mmalecki: i don't get wy you need to catch and handle the listen errors anyway.
[21:11] mmalecki: isaacs: and it's actually nice to be able to listen wherever you want
[21:11] bnoordhuis: HardFu: i may have a strange solution
[21:12] HardFu: if i run d=new Date(); d.setHours(0); console.log(d);

[21:13] isaacs: if, somewhere else in my code, i do net.connect("localhost", 12345), what happens?
[21:13] mmalecki: isaacs: usually you are listening on the port you choose
[21:14] mmalecki: isaacs: well, universe will break
[21:14] isaacs: mmalecki: exactly.
[21:14] mmalecki: we encourage people not do to it
[21:14] mmalecki: cause, we like universe
[21:14] isaacs: why not just break the world up front, by having the listen fail?
[21:14] isaacs: then let me handle it.
[21:14] isaacs: otherwise the magical lie becomes a source of *later* failure, instead of failing when you know it's a problem.
[21:14] joshsmith: can someone help me figure out what I'm doing wrong in requiring this module?
[21:14] joshsmith: https://github.com/glesperance/node-kissmetrics/blob/master/lib/kissmetrics.js
[21:15] mmalecki: isaacs: still, it'd be nice to have net.on('listening')
[21:15] mmalecki: isaacs: or... something
[21:15] joshsmith: I'm doing require('kissmetrics')({'key': 'MY_KEY'})
[21:15] isaacs: mmalecki: if necessary, provide some api to reserve the next available port.
[21:15] isaacs: mmalecki: listen takes a cb
[21:15] joshsmith: but it's saying it's undefined
[21:15] isaacs: mmalecki: the server is the object.  net is not the object, it's a namespace.
[21:16] mmalecki: isaacs: net.Server.on('listening') wouldn't work, right?
[21:16] wdbl: I don't know many high level SDKs that let you listen in on every socket opened in the process. You can do it in C or C++, but usually not in the higher level kits.
[21:16] isaacs: mmalecki: no, net.server is not an EE, it's a class.
[21:16] mmalecki: isaacs: exactly :)
[21:16] isaacs: mmalecki: you're trying to solve a problem that you have invented.  just don't invent the problem.
[21:17] isaacs: back up.  unwind the use case further.
[21:17] mmalecki: isaacs: so, well, keeping track of ports you open *would* be cool
[21:17] isaacs: mmalecki: if you let my program fail, then i'll do that.

[21:19] mmalecki: wdbl: https://github.com/nodejitsu/haibu-carapace

[21:19] davidsklar1 has joined the channel
[21:19] boltR has joined the channel
[21:20] tjfontaine: right, so I don't see why this needs to muck with the core, wrap it up in a module and let your consumers decide if they want the functionality
[21:20] dshaw_ has joined the channel
[21:20] mmalecki: tjfontaine: not really, we tell our load balancers to forward traffic to the port you open
[21:21] bradleymeck: isaacs, the main reason for this is to allow multiple drones to think they are listening on port 80 etc. without eaddrinuse, you can just use IPTables on linux or similar to get around the connection stuff, that and not allowing users to open up the real port 80 etc even if they are in a jail is something we would like to keep
[21:21] johnhamelink has joined the channel
[21:21] mmalecki: oh, yeah, that ^
[21:21] bradleymeck: if you want to take the C9 approach or env PORT you are generally limited to N number of ports which we will be unable to deal with when hook.io support comes along
[21:21] isaacs: bradleymeck: or you can use node's built-in cluster support, or zones/jails/vms behind a http router.
[21:21] tjfontaine: plenty of other platform ways to determine what a process is listening on without mucking around with core
[21:22] vguerra has joined the channel
[21:22] bradleymeck: you could do it the heroku way and preconfigure it too
[21:22] isaacs: bradleymeck: or you can just do like heroku, and force them to use a different port, adn put it in the env.
[21:22] praCt: bnoordhuis: do you possibly know if for tcp rcon, net.createServer will do?
[21:22] isufy has joined the channel
[21:22] isaacs: really, there are many many ways around this problem that don't involve hijacking node's net binding.
[21:22] bnoordhuis: praCt: you want to connect to a rcon server right? in that case, you'd use net.createConnection()
[21:22] isaacs: when you assume that the known-unsafe approach is just not an option, other solutions become more visible.
[21:23] isaacs: and really, they're not bad.
[21:23] bradleymeck: isaacs yes, but adding another vm is no less complex, we have plans in the future to avoid the net binding, but even then the IPTables solutions and VM solutions are not things we are too happy with
[21:23] isaacs: well, a vm (or better yet, sunos zone or bsd jail) is a bigger solution.
[21:23] isaacs: if you want apps to be isolated *for real*, then that's how you do it.
[21:23] HardFu: which mongodb library do you prefer, mongooses or mongolia deadbeef?
[21:23] isaacs: you give them each an *actual* network stack, etc.
[21:24] bradleymeck: we have a jail but even then we want to know which they attempted to listen to inside of it
[21:24] bradleymeck: you could do a polling solution but that would have a potential for racing
[21:24] isaacs: bradleymeck: with no.de, we put each app in a zone, and just proxy their hostname on the router to their app's :80
[21:24] mmalecki: isaacs: multiple ports?
[21:25] isaacs: mmalecki: you get 80, and another one for ssh, and that's it.
[21:25] isaacs: mmalecki: if you want more, buy a zone.

[21:25] swaj: are there any providers that sell a freebsd jail piecemeal (sort of like a VPS provider)? or is that idea just silly?
[21:25] bradleymeck: mmalecki, that wouldnt be an issue if we only had limited ports, but we wont end up with that most likely
[21:25] isaacs: swaj: i don't know of any that sell bsd jails, but joyent sells smartos zones.
[21:26] mmalecki: bradleymeck: we should totally discuss how we want to implement it later
[21:27] pifantastic has joined the channel
[21:27] bradleymeck: mmalecki, we know how we do, its just not pretty to do it, almost every solution has a downside when you allow any port dynamically
[21:27] cjroebuck has joined the channel
[21:28] mmalecki: bradleymeck: and how are we going to load balance this traffic?
[21:28] xbayrockx has left the channel
[21:29] bradleymeck: in a way pretty much the same as now, because basically anything above c's bind() is bad for us including our shim, which is a 90% catcher but not ideal

[21:32] bradleymeck: wdbl im not sure how that would work with other IaaS, since we are not tied to any single one
[21:33] wdbl: on the network it should just appear as a different IP address
[21:33] bradleymeck: cant just grab ips willy nilly
[21:33] tjfontaine: you can match by uid/gid in iptables
[21:34] bradleymeck: wdbl but we would need to guarantee we would be assigned the 2nd one, iptables is one thing we have looked at but it takes time for it to be setup after the bind()
