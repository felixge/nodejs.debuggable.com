[00:30] SubStack: illumina: mostly just the docs are different, everything should work pretty much the same
[00:31] SubStack: entries have been in there for months but nobody was using them because the docs didn't emphasize them enough
[00:31] illumina: SubStack: seems the way that the headers are resolved was changed substantially? It's failing to require("") -- looks like something about the default behavior changed
[00:31] illumina: is that a new thing for wrapping the entry point file?
[00:31] SubStack: require("")?
[00:32] hostsamurai has joined the channel
[00:32] illumina: yeah… it's part of the generated file. the last line.
[00:32] SubStack: o_O
[00:32] illumina: it looks like it is wrapping my entry point file in a module named ""
[00:32] illumina: and trying to require it

[00:35] illumina: also I put the command options I'm using at the top of the paste
[00:36] maushu: SubStack, did you grok anything in the ssh protocol after the key exchange?
[00:36] SubStack: illumina: how are you invoking broserify?
[00:36] kriszyp has joined the channel
[00:36] illumina: see the first line of the paste
[00:36] SubStack: maushu: yes ssh is pretty simple after the key exchange
[00:36] SubStack: but the key exchange is nightmarish to get right
[00:36] maushu: ...
[00:37] maushu: Where the heck are the algorithms for the keys?
[00:37] SubStack: maushu: which project are you looking at?
[00:37] SubStack: I had 2 attempts
[00:37] maushu: SubStack, I'm looking at the ref.
[00:37] SubStack: oh
[00:37] maushu: http://www.snailbook.com/protocols.html
[00:38] maushu: I mean, the client and the server exchange the list of algorithms that they have... then what?
[00:38] maushu: Where are the packets with id 30 to 40-something?
[00:38] maushu: It says here that they are specific for the algorithm used...
[00:38] illumina: SubStack: specifically the error I'm getting is on line 44 (in the paste)
[00:38] SubStack: maushu: I don't remember it so well
[00:39] illumina: Uncaught Error: Cannot find module ''
[00:39] SubStack: maushu: but http://github.com/substack/node-ssh-server might be of use
[00:39] SubStack: illumina: yes but how you're invoking browserify matters here so I can duplicate it
[00:40] SubStack: the final output doesn't actually tell me very much
[00:40] illumina: I put the full command line on line 1 in the paste!
[00:40] SubStack: oh, didn't see

[01:43] isaacs: SubStack: the one on california?

[01:52] SubStack: quackquack: depends on what you're doing, they do very different things
[01:53] brianc1: quackquack:  I would guess it adds about .1% performance bottlekneck as compared to the time it takes a message to get from browser to server
[01:53] quackquack: SubStack: the browser would be making calls to manipulate sandboxed file system on the server (read file, move file, etc)
[01:54] jga023 has left the channel

[03:20] kriszyp has joined the channel
[03:22] Aria: You don't run node.js in your browser, you run your browser's js in your browser.
[03:23] bfrederi: I'm mostly just curious on how to run client-side javascript (specifically node.js would be nice) in my browser, just for myself. I've never done that. I've only included it in webpages I've created.
[03:23] OneOfOne: odd question, anyone knows how to access a zebra ZPLII usb printer on windows? (in node or python)
[03:23] Aria: node isn't client side, that's the thing.
[03:24] OneOfOne: or to be more specific, how to open the usb port and wrote to it
[03:24] illumina: bfrederi: you probably can get what you want by writing a browser extension
[03:25] bfrederi: illumina: Ok, I guess I got a little confused by word of mouth. node.js is exclusively server-side, mostly for asynchronous capabilities, correct?
[03:25] Aria: Yes.
[03:26] illumina: brederi: sort of
[03:26] bfrederi: That clears it all up, I was getting pretty confused.
[03:26] illumina: node is a runtime environment for javascript that is outside of the browser
[03:26] illumina: it doesn't have to be "server side" or "client side"
[03:26] illumina: but most people use node to run javascript server-side
[03:27] Aria: Yeah.
[03:27] bfrederi: illumina: Yeah, I'm sure you can use it to create all sorts of web or non-web applications.
[03:27] illumina: but if you wanted to make a script that ran on your computer in javascript, you can run it with node as well
[03:27] bfrederi: Yeah, of course.
[03:27] illumina: yup :-)
[03:27] bfrederi: Just like any scripting language.
[03:27] illumina: exactly
[03:27] bfrederi: Cool.
[03:28] bfrederi: For some reason the bots for turntable have at least one component that is written in node.js.
[03:28] bfrederi: Not sure why.

[03:32] tbranyen: Marak: nice lib
[03:32] tbranyen: :D
[03:32] Marak: check this shit out, http://ohh.io/ANSIdom https://github.com/marak/ANSIdom
[03:33] Marak: DOM implementation in ANSI codes
[03:33] Marak: share templates with the browser...and terminal
[03:33] bfrederi: How does it get access to Turntable.fm though? How does the bot log in, and how does it do anything? Does it do everything through http requests, or a Turntable API?
[03:33] Marak: thanks tbranyen :-) its a total hack, 6 hour project
[03:33] Marak: lol
[03:33] bfrederi: Aria: Sorry, that was a question for you.
[03:34] keyvan: bfrederi: those answers are revealed in code.
[03:34] Aria: ACTION looks at the source to see.
[03:34] Aria: I suspect that the answer is both. I bet their API /is/ http.
[03:34] keyvan: heh Aria is really nice.
[03:34] keyvan: almost /too/ nice... *looks suspiciously at Aria*
[03:35] Aria: Websockets, actually. So a sort-of HTTP, but more like a raw socket connection
[03:35] bfrederi: Aria: keyvan: Yeah, I am really failing to understand their use of node.js. I appreciate the help.
[03:36] Aria: It connects to turntable's server, upgrades from http to websocket protocol, and then starts sending and receiving commands in a ~neverending stream.
[03:36] mAritz has joined the channel
[03:36] bfrederi: Aria: I'm suprised Turntable allows that. It could be crawling with spam users.
[03:36] Aria: You do have to authenticate. So they do know which account to kill if it gets misused.
[03:36] keyvan: bfrederi: all node.js is doing is giving the programmer the ability to use Javascript (and node's built in methods/libraries for async communication). it coudl have been written in ruby or python. Node is, like you said, simply a standalone interpreter for javascript--outside the browser
[03:37] tomlion has joined the channel
[03:37] smathy has joined the channel
[03:37] bfrederi: Aria: keyvan: I understand that. But I guess I wasn't accepting that, because it just seems really trusting on turntables part.
[03:38] Phaaze has joined the channel
[03:38] Aria: Yep. It is.
[03:38] Aria: But then, you deal with problems as you see it. Is there a captcha on their signup?
[03:38] bfrederi: I could create the bot in any language. They aren't blocking referrers that are probably up to no good.
[03:38] bfrederi: No, it's all through Facebook.
[03:38] bfrederi: Right now.
[03:39] bfrederi: You have to have a Facebook account to login, supposedly...
[03:40] bfrederi: But I'm not sure how to use those credentials in any scripting language. I guess you have to use Facebooks API as well? I'm new to all of these "thing talking to each other".
[03:40] keyvan: i havent used Turntable, so i can only speak of node.js. i personally dont care about turntable or facebook *glares at those apps vengefully*
[03:40] Aria: Yeah.
[03:40] Aria: Facebook uses oauth, which is annoyingly complex, but people have done the hard part already in most languages.
[03:41] bfrederi: So, it is built into something they created this app with.
[03:41] bfrederi: Or they wrote it in the app, and I haven't seen it yet.
[03:43] smathy has joined the channel
[03:44] Aria: I think the turntable stuff just expects a username and password -- which I think you can get if you finish signing up for turntable
[03:44] spcshpopr8r has joined the channel
[03:44] bfrederi: Sorry, I'm really bad at reading javascript. And knowing what is Node.js and what is just plain javascript. Like I'm assuming the websocket.js is a common javascript script that they just packaged in with it.
[03:45] Aria: Nope.
[03:45] Aria: It's a node websocket client library.
[03:45] technoweenie has joined the channel
[03:45] Aria: Like does the whole speak-http-and-upgrade-to-websocket dance.
[03:45] Aria: Stuff browsers can't do, since they don't let javascript get so close to the metal.
[03:45] Peniar has joined the channel
[03:46] Aria: That said, some browsers have websockets, so it could be done in the browser on those, though perhaps differently.

[03:47] upgrayeddd: ircretary is ever so helpful.
[03:47] ircretary: upgrayeddd: I'm not sure what to do with that command.  Ask for help in PM.
[03:47] bfrederi: Okay, that's all above my head, unfortunately. I'm usually dealing with stuff at a higher level. And I've never really delved at all into websockets.
[03:47] jtsnow has joined the channel
[03:50] dexter_e has joined the channel
[03:51] bfrederi: So websockets are just like a more efficient, less supported protocol for data transfer.
[03:52] bfrederi: To overgeneralize it.
[03:52] bfrederi: comparing to http.
[03:52] tomlion has joined the channel
[03:52] bfrederi: Am I close?
[03:52] Aria: Yes.
[03:53] Aria: They're more realtime, in that they stay open and allow back-and-forth.
[03:53] Aria: Rather than HTTP's aim to be in-and-out-and-shut-down-again.
[03:53] bfrederi: but even more efficient than a keep-alive request, due to the fact that it piggybacks extra information in the request/response?
[03:54] Aria: Yep.
[03:54] Aria: Also, keep-alive only means the client can send another request; the server can't start it.
[03:54] bfrederi: <-- learning things I should already know :) Thanks
[03:54] Aria: To have it go two-way, you need craziness like long polling, BOSH or stuff like that.
[03:54] keyvan: ya these are good questions bfrederi thanks Aria
[03:55] Aria: Sure thing.

[05:13] technoweenie: is there a decent way to package up multiple npm projects in one project?  i dont want 'hubot' to depend on xmpp/node-expat just because of the xmpp adapter
[05:13] jesusabdullah: Marak: Judge Mathis?
[05:14] technoweenie: is breaking every adapter to a separate lib the only way?  hubot-xmpp or whatever
[05:14] takezawa has joined the channel
[05:17] Marak: technoweenie: for kohai, every plugin is standalone process...
[05:17] secoif: technoweenie use bundledDependencies in your package.json
[05:18] Marak: technoweenie: plugins are hot-swappable
[05:18] Marak: technoweenie: and all separate libs
[05:18] technoweenie: Marak: not quite what i'm asking for, thanks tho
[05:18] Marak: technoweenie: hook.io integration with your bot would give you access to about 30 plugins too
[05:18] Marak: already live
[05:18] Marak: just send some JSON back and forth, super easy
[05:19] Marak: technoweenie: regardless, you will probably want each "adapter" to be a npm pacakge
[05:19] Marak: it will save sanity down the road
[05:19] technoweenie: secoif: it looks like `npm bundle` is deprecated
[05:20] technoweenie: i may just throw the tarballs in the repo and point package.json at it
[05:20] Marak: technoweenie: bundling is for ruby

[05:21] Marak: or npm link
[05:21] eddyb: wtf?
[05:21] secoif: technoweenie I'm not sure if npm bundle being deprecated means you can't use bundledDependencies
[05:21] technoweenie: yea, we do that in our prod apps, but none of the libs are compiled
[05:21] Marak: tarball is okay too
[05:21] eddyb: technoweenie: just make them deps
[05:22] eddyb: in package.json
[05:22] eddyb: npm install .
[05:22] eddyb: or npm install packagename (after publishing)
[05:22] eddyb: will add the deps and compile anything needed
[05:22] eddyb: that's *all*
[05:23] eddyb: or you can do npm install name
[05:23] technoweenie: npm went to hell this morning, and a bunch of users' first exposure to hubot and node.js was some crazy npm errors.  they dont know wtf is going on
[05:23] technoweenie: so i'm trying to get around any external dependencies
[05:23] secoif: what was this 'hell'?
[05:23] eddyb: inside a directory with package.json, to install that module under that directory
[05:24] eddyb: technoweenie: that's nasty
[05:24] technoweenie: secoif: npm lost about a week's worth of packages
[05:24] secoif: ouch
[05:24] secoif: wow
[05:24] eddyb: technoweenie: you can always download from github
[05:24] markmuskardin has joined the channel
[05:24] jesusabdullah: That sounds like what should be an uncommon occurence though
[05:24] jesusabdullah: like, I don't think that's happened before

[05:25] technoweenie: well maybe not for your wimpy little web apps
[05:25] technoweenie: but chat bots are serious business
[05:25] secoif: and additionally, if people are judging your library based on a fuckup by a totally unrelated library… 
[05:25] secoif: I mean
[05:26] technoweenie: i just want their first impression of Hubot to be awesome
[05:27] jesusabdullah: fwiw I've never heard of npm losing packages like that before
[05:27] secoif: it'd be like blaming hubot when my internet connection gets slow cause of some network issue
[05:27] eddyb: technoweenie: use github
[05:27] eddyb: most people put their work there
[05:27] eddyb: you can download from there
[05:28] martin_sunset: eddyb: I think technoweenie works at github:)
[05:28] eddyb: and most of the time, they got node_modules with dependencies filled in already
[05:28] eddyb: ok, wtf?
[05:28] eddyb: I'm confused now
[05:28] eddyb: technoweenie: so, again, what's your problem?
[05:28] technoweenie: its way up there ^
[05:29] eddyb: you want a package.json that give you 2 modules?
[05:29] eddyb: or what?
[05:29] eddyb: I don't get it
[05:29] rklancer: Dear lazyirc, re npm and Bundler. Is there the equivalent of 'bundle update'? (a way to say, "upgrade my dependencies to newer versions, consistent with some rules, then freeze my versions again"?)
[05:30] technoweenie: eddyb: its kind of a weird situation, i understand.  
[05:30] rklancer: (given that I'm just starting with node.js and coffeescript, and only just now realized that npm was more like Bundler than apt-get)
[05:30] secoif: technoweenie btw hubot looks real nice.
[05:30] secoif: :D
[05:30] technoweenie: rklancer: i dont think npm has that

[05:31] rklancer: technoweenie: thanks, that saves me spending a lot of time scouring npm docs before I need to :)
[05:31] technoweenie: rklancer: npm only has the most basic of bundler features, but it should be all you need
[05:32] eddyb: technoweenie: uhm. I can't see how to wrap my head around this
[05:32] technoweenie: the node/npm integration is pretty awesome
[05:32] rklancer: yeah, just curious .... and you know what curiosity does
[05:32] technoweenie: eddyb: then dont worry about it :)
[05:32] eddyb: technoweenie: you know what's awesome?

[09:52] tiglionabbit: bnoordhuis: yeah but lets say my code is in the middle of doing stuff with the buffer data when it realizes more is needed
[09:52] tiglionabbit: it'd need to stop and wait for the next data event before resuming
[09:52] tiglionabbit: how can you implement that?
[09:52] bnoordhuis: tiglionabbit: stuff it into a queue, implement your parser / data consumer as a state machine
[09:52] tiglionabbit: I think I'd want to create a function object to represent the resume point or something...
[09:53] tiglionabbit: a state machine hm
[09:54] tiglionabbit: any guidance on that?  helpful libraries?
[09:56] tiglionabbit: example implementations to look at?
[09:56] jetienne_ has joined the channel
[09:56] tiglionabbit: was hoping I could just put this thing together real quick, but the unpredictability of how much data I'm gonna get is making things difficult
[09:56] facerip has joined the channel
[09:57] Glenjamin: what sort of data is it?
[09:58] Glenjamin: if its XML or JSON then evented parsers already exist
[09:59] tiglionabbit: nah it's some silly protocol I inherited from my co-workers.  It's plain text, then a new line, then binary data.  The plain text describes what's in the binary data portion and tells you how long it is.
[09:59] sylvinus has joined the channel
[09:59] tiglionabbit: so after I parse the plain text bit, I know how much binary data I need before I can continue...
[10:00] augustl: tiglionabbit: but if it tells you know long it is, you already know?
[10:01] tiglionabbit: yes I know, but the problem is the buffer node gives me in a single data event isn't long enough
[10:01] tiglionabbit: there is more data yet to receive
[10:01] augustl: so wait for the next one? :)
[10:01] Glenjamin: on data, append to buffer. Check buffer, if big enough, parse, else do nothing
[10:01] augustl: tiglionabbit: so. Create a buffer with the appropriate size
[10:01] jomoho has joined the channel
[10:02] augustl: copy the data event buffers into that buffer
[10:03] tiglionabbit: it's also possible that it might not give me all of the plain text in one go, so that's another thing I gotta worry about
[10:03] tiglionabbit: two steps here
[10:03] te-brian has joined the channel
[10:03] augustl: tiglionabbit: http://pastie.org/2766880
[10:03] tiglionabbit: and I dunno how long the plain text will be.  It's until you find a newline
[10:03] augustl: tiglionabbit: right, you need a parser that can handle chunked data in any form
[10:03] augustl: all you know is you'll get them in correct order
[10:03] fly-away has joined the channel
[10:03] tiglionabbit: mhm
[10:04] augustl: that code is just for the buffer "concatination" obviously
[10:04] tiglionabbit: this is more complex than I was hoping :P
[10:04] Glenjamin: parsing usually is
[10:04] augustl: you need state to know if you're currently looking at data to concat, etc etc
[10:04] augustl: tiglionabbit: it's pretty managable
[10:04] augustl: unit tests to the rescue ;)
[10:04] augustl: makes it a lot easier to test against a bunch of different cases of chunks etc
[10:05] augustl: what you do know is that the first chunk you'll ever get is the plain text part with the content length etc
[10:05] augustl: so you know your initial state
[10:05] TomY has joined the channel
[10:06] ayaz has joined the channel
[10:06] augustl: so scan the data byte by byte until you find an ASCII newline, then set the state and create a buffer, and so on
[10:07] aaronmcadam has joined the channel
[10:08] daneroo has joined the channel

[10:52] nabax: so wait a minute, /usr/local/bin should contain a file named node-waf?
[10:52] bnoordhuis: yes
[10:52] nabax: ouch so here's the source of the issue I guess
[10:52] nabax: it's not there
[10:53] salavert: anyone know if it's possible to install node.js and npm on site5.com shared hosting?
[10:53] bnoordhuis: there's a node binary in there?
[10:53] maushu: salavert: do you have ssh access?
[10:53] tomb: nabax: do you have a NODE_PATH env var?
[10:53] bnoordhuis: salavert: yes, if you have shell access and there's a compiler toolchain available
[10:54] maushu: ...but I don't think so.
[10:54] salavert: hmm thx bnoordhuis , I will check and try
[10:54] nabax: bnoordhuis, nope, no node binary either
[10:54] salavert: shell access is no problem, and compiler dunno
[10:54] bnoordhuis: nabax: well... where is it?
[10:54] nabax: bnoordhuis, the node binary is in /usr/bin
[10:55] nabax: but no node-waf file there either
[10:55] nabax: tomb, no NODE_PATH either
[10:55] bnoordhuis: did you install the nodejs .deb?
[10:55] nabax: I guess the npm installation didn't work out that well hehe
[10:55] nabax: bnoordhuis, yes
[10:55] bnoordhuis: okay, you need to install the nodejs-dev package too

[15:44] rektide: less thread pools for async io, I would expect, anything else?
[15:44] tjholowaychuk: accept() kinda acts as a load balancer for you
[15:44] deedubs: it has a master process which can detect the death of the child processes and respond accordingly

[15:46] trose: brianc1, I'm using your postgres library. Is it possible to reference the client inside of the client.query callback? ie. I want to run a select command that returns a primary key then do an insert with that primary key. the value of that is only accessible inside the callback so i want to just call client.query again but I'm getting "Error: connection pointer is NULL"
[15:47] trose: brianc1, do i need to open a new connection inside of the first client.query callback?
[15:47] rektide: the traditional means of sharing a port was to fork and use the same fd,
[15:47] EhevuTov has joined the channel
[15:47] rektide: tjholowaychuk: is it possible to share a port with forked instances/not using cluster?
[15:47] tjholowaychuk: rektide that's what it does, but it's in core now because of windows support
[15:48] rektide: deedubs: where can i read about the master process, and how to respond to child death?
[15:48] rektide: tjholowaychuk: i see.
[15:48] deedubs: tjholowaychuk: What was the final API decided for the master process? is that still in flux?
[15:48] tjholowaychuk: still changing
[15:48] rektide: there are no options to cluster to, i dunno, 8 out of my 48 cores, or stuff like that?

[15:53] brianc1: trose: I'm here now
[15:54] rektide: i'm trying to think of advantages for multi-core node
[15:54] brianc1: trose: no, you don't need to.  are you using the native bindings or the pure javascript?
[15:54] trose: brianc1, http://paste2.org/p/1741911
[15:54] trose: native bindings
[15:55] trose: I have no problems when I'm running evaluate scripts on small files. It's throwing this error when i have a script that takes 2min + to work
[15:55] trose: is there some sort of timeout on callbacks?
[15:56] brianc1: trose: that's most likely a bug, though strange it hasn't been seen before.  Please submit OS, node version, postgres version, node-postgres version, and smallets amount of code you can use to reliably reproduce the issue on github and I'll have it figured out within 48 hours
[15:56] blup: ive used async before for parallel processes. however, i was wondering if there's a way to limit the ammount of concurrent processes? (so my machine can survive the day)
[15:56] trose: brianc1, sick I'll write that up right away
[15:57] brianc1: trose: also, try using the non-native bindings
[15:57] trose: kk
[15:58] fzzzy has joined the channel
[15:59] hebot has joined the channel
[16:00] trose: brianc1, yeah it throws a similar error with non-native bindings

[16:00] te-brian has joined the channel
[16:01] brianc1: trose: okay cool just include that info in the github issue.  I will use your failing code to make a failing test-case and then fix it TDD style
[16:01] brianc1: bug-driven-development 
[16:01] trose: brianc1, hellz yeah
[16:02] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: why don't you just use path.extname?
[16:02] tjholowaychuk: that's not my lib
[16:02] isaacs: > require("path").extname("foo.bar")
[16:02] isaacs: '.bar'
[16:03] isaacs: oh, ok
[16:03] rklancer_ has joined the channel
[16:03] isaacs: i guess extname is doing roughly the same thing
[16:04] AphelionZ has joined the channel
[16:04] baudehlo: isaacs: I had a thought - you're probably ideally placed to keep stats on platform users of node, at least from an npm installation point of view... Do you gather those stats at all?
[16:04] baudehlo: like windows/linux/sun/mac etc
[16:05] baudehlo: be interesting to graph over time.

[16:06] deedubs: +1 for that idea!
[16:07] trose: brianc1, real quick in case I have an error http://jsfiddle.net/c2ZpF/ could i be causing a problem by having a query inside of a callback inside of a callback? Maybe the outer callback is closing or something?
[16:07] baudehlo: most http clients send OS info anyway, so it wouldn't be too much of an intrusion.

[16:30] rklancer_: whoops
[16:31] StanlySoManly has joined the channel
[16:32] rklancer_: If I'm just using node for its module handling -- I and my colleagues want to make a pure-JS library (albeit written in Coffeescript) -- that we could repackage in a  node.js environment or send to a browser for client-side execution -- and I want my colleagues to get coffeescript, cake, and other dependencies set up by 'git clone' followed by 'npm install'...
[16:33] rklancer_: is there a standard way to populate the bin/ folder with things like the `coffee` executable ... like I would using rvm & Bundler ("run bundle install, then you can run 'bin/whatever' to do X)
[16:34] rklancer_: I've figured out that I can make symlinks to ./node_modules/.bin/coffee, but I didn't know if npm handles this use case explicitly
[16:34] lightcap has joined the channel
[16:35] martin_sunset: rklancer_: not sure what you want to achieve, why do you need a coffee bin?

[16:35] wadey has joined the channel

[16:36] rklancer_: or 'bin/coffee' in this case

[16:37] martin_sunset: Add coffeescript as a dev dependency. I'll MSG you a sample it hub project link
[16:37] rklancer_: thx
[16:38] context: rklancer_: you still need npm and node and coffee installed first.

[16:38] isaiah_ has joined the channel

[16:41] context: you're going to install node there too ? seems scary

[17:09] brianc1: i used the printf because I was never able to get that event to happen when developing
[17:11] brianc1: if you could get a test case, that would be cool.  I'd like to see if I can get that error to come out of the client#connect callback and not at a 'random' time off of the client.emit('error')

[17:26] saesh_ has joined the channel
[17:27] booo: brianc1, as soon as you have arrays in you postgres database there is a use case and our application makes use of arrays and there are other schema with arrays out there i guess. however... i would like to implement this and we somehow started with the fork from alexander but there were some problems bringing the code upstream

[18:01] isaacs: baudehlo: yep.
[18:01] baudehlo: nice.
[18:01] isaacs: that's how i'll do -z :)
[18:02] isaacs: it won't be nearly as fast as schilly tar, or as complete of a tape archive utility.
[18:02] baudehlo: no, but as long as it does all you need, it's nice to have a pure JS implementatino.

[18:03] ryan0x2 has joined the channel
[18:04] baudehlo: you could always have it try the binary version first.
[18:04] baudehlo: I do like how fast npm is compared to the CPAN shell. Though that's mostly to do with running tests I think.
[18:05] isaacs: baudehlo: the problem is that the binary version *doesn't* do all i need.
[18:05] konobi: baudehlo: you can enable testing by default with npm too though =0)
[18:05] isaacs: since i can't know which version of the binary tar you have.
[18:06] AvianFlu has joined the channel
[18:06] isaacs: konobi: i think if i turned on tests by default in npm, express users would riot

[18:06] eddyb: some keep this in mind: the gyp version doesn't care about shared_v8
[18:06] eddyb: *someone
[18:06] isaacs: once tests pass more of the time, we can make npat default
[18:06] baudehlo: isaacs: yes but there are checks you can do to see if does do what you need, and cache the results of the checks.

[18:07] tjholowaychuk: nice sanity check
[18:07] tjholowaychuk: but still
[18:07] CoverSlide: wow
[18:07] CoverSlide: must be a cpan user
[18:07] isaacs: baudehlo: npm config set npat true;  then add a "scripts": { "test": "./do stuff" }
[18:07] baudehlo: cool
[18:07] baudehlo: and does it check the exit status == 0?
[18:07] fzzzy has joined the channel
[18:07] isaacs: baudehlo: yeah
[18:08] isaacs: if npat=true, then a failed test will be a failed install

[19:02] sh1mmer: isaacs: this is an issue I've run into a bunch of times with node-inspector and other things while running tutorials
[19:02] tiglionabbit: does node actually do non-blocking disk io?
[19:02] tiglionabbit: and if so, how does node implement that?
[19:02] sh1mmer: tiglionabbit: yes
[19:02] CoverSli1e: i like to do `ln -s node_modules/.bin/ ./bin`
[19:03] isaacs: sh1mmer: there's already the "preferGlobal" field
[19:03] isaacs: sh1mmer: authors can do this.
[19:03] creatorbri: @mmalecki: Say, whats with the !npm trick? Where does that come from?
[19:03] tiglionabbit: sh1mmer: I have heard that there is no such thing as asynchronous disk io on unix, without the use of multiple threads/processes
[19:03] sh1mmer: ACTION google npm docs
[19:03] sechrist: node has a thread pool
[19:03] tiglionabbit: what, really?
[19:03] tiglionabbit: I thought node was single threaded
[19:03] sechrist: for blocking syscalls, if I recall correctly

[19:04] jstash: libeio
[19:04] jstash: (or libuv)
[19:04] CoverSli1e: the framework itself is single-threaded
[19:04] CoverSli1e: and javascript itself has no official thread support
[19:04] sh1mmer: tiglionabbit: we use lib-ev, so it polls
[19:04] sh1mmer: tiglionabbit: faked
[19:04] CoverSli1e: but threads are required for doing async disk i/o on *nux
[19:05] sh1mmer: tiglionabbit: the single thread is JavaScript programming model
[19:06] sh1mmer: tiglionabbit: as the programmer of a Node program you only have direct access to a single thread in the JavaScript environment
[19:06] sh1mmer: the APIs allow you to request work from the other threads which it returned into your single thread as callbacks
[19:06] tiglionabbit: what do you mean faked?
[19:06] creatorbri has left the channel
[19:06] sh1mmer: tiglionabbit: we poll. So it's not event driven
[19:06] tiglionabbit: ah
[19:06] sh1mmer: but it's exposed back to JavaScript as events
[19:06] tiglionabbit: but it doesn't block the server thread, and that's the important part

[19:07] tiglionabbit: I'm trying to convince my co-workers that node is viable for this project.  They're trying to use gevent though, but python doesn't seem to have any way of doing asynchronous disk io
[19:07] baudehlo: it doesn't?
[19:08] tiglionabbit: well, unless you do multithreading :P
[19:08] tjholowaychuk: almost every language
[19:08] tjholowaychuk: has something similar to node
[19:08] tjholowaychuk: you just have all the baggage of legacy community stuff
[19:08] baudehlo: mind you the guy who wrote libev originally wrote it for perl.
[19:08] tiglionabbit: tornado and gevent are like node, but I don't know what's like asynchronous disk io for python

[19:09] EyePulp: so I'm using the dns module to lookup domains and where they're pointing - does that module simply use my own local DNS settings to go look?  Is there a way I can make it go back to the authoritative server to verify the most current settings?

[19:10] EyePulp: does that make sense? =)
[19:10] baudehlo: well, cares reads resolv.conf
[19:10] baudehlo: no, you just have to wait. :)

[21:23] maushu_: Who highlighted me?
[21:23] waheedi: i hate and love developers attitude :)
[21:23] mendel_ has joined the channel
[21:23] maushu_: More than 2 hours ago. -_-'
[21:24] jerrysv: waheedi: so what sorts of things are you trying to clean up?  if it's 1000 lines of code in one file, there's problem number 1
[21:24] TheJH: waheedi, if you aren't writing that code for a contract or corporation or whatever, you might want to show it to us so that we can yell at you before you rewrite it :P
[21:24] waheedi: lol :)

[21:24] mendel_: guys is it possible to let vlc --sout a audio file to nodejs, and let let nodejs cut the audio in segments of 10 sec?
[21:24] waheedi: its not in one file jerrysv :)
[21:25] waheedi: TheJH:  thanks man, ill figure it out myself much appreciated
[21:25] TheJH: mendel_, I don't think we have audio processing in node yet
[21:25] heavysixer has joined the channel
[21:25] mendel_: yeah I know.. but maybe it's like a buffer or something..
[21:25] jerrysv: waheedi: good. but kind of curious what parts and pieces are global
[21:25] TheJH: mendel_, feel free to write a module for handling PCM audio or so
[21:26] waheedi: arrays jerrysv

[22:55] xerox: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.12/api/modules.html
[22:55] xerox: yes this
[22:55] illumina: bnoordhuis: I want to move classes into files so I can use them from multiple places, but I *don't* want those files to conceptually be "modules"
[22:55] xerox: it explains how the export object and the module.exports properties work
[22:55] Antaranian has left the channel
[22:56] illumina: xerox: yeah I've read that. actually… it's not what I want. I'd like to get C++ style include behavior, basically
[22:56] xerox: no pre-processor as far as I know
[22:56] illumina: xerox: ah yes. sorry I don't need to preprocess
[22:57] illumina: specifically: "entity_lib = require('entity'); new entity_lib.Entity();"   <-- stupid verbose
[22:57] xerox: but exchanging function Class (..) {..} for var Class = require('./class')
[22:57] xerox: is not very bad is it
[22:57] illumina: well that doesn't work if you have a couple classes in a file, afaik
[22:57] xerox: var FirstClass = require('./classes').FirstClass
[22:58] xerox:   , SecondClass = require('./classes').SecondClass
[22:58] xerox: maybe ?
[22:58] illumina: right! so, maybe I'm looking for a wrapper to require that will automatically pull out those top level classes
[22:58] xerox: I believe that is just overkill
[22:58] illumina: well, I won't judge your beliefs if you don't judge mine ;-)
[22:58] xerox: also note that the second require is cached

[23:51] shimondoodkin: when window is recreated like refresh timers are abandoned

[23:53] Tobsn: i have chrome dev console open and i see the changes on the DOM and its not changing much
[23:53] shimondoodkin: there is an argument i think it is called defer

[23:54] tjholowaychuk: i find those sorts of patterns kinda fragile though personally
[23:54] te-brian: Was looking at railway.js .. but even with that there is only one level of heirarchy
[23:54] Tobsn: doesnt defer just delay?

[23:55] te-brian: tjholowaychuk: I'm coming into node with my infected Drupal mindset .. and in many ways the module structure has worked out for us... but I'm sure there are pitfalls
[23:55] tjholowaychuk: yeah

[23:55] tjholowaychuk: i have a half-finished modular drupal-inspired thing built with express
[23:55] tjholowaychuk: but it's not done
[23:56] te-brian: tjholowaychuk: Anything to look at ?

[23:56] Tobsn: shimondoodkin, it also says its only IE?
[23:56] tjholowaychuk: i dont think modules should style though personally
[23:56] tjholowaychuk: you want something that looks integrated
[23:56] cscotta has left the channel
[23:56] shimondoodkin: i am checking it now
[23:56] tjholowaychuk: not just slap on some completely separate app
[23:56] tjholowaychuk: drupal gets modularity right though
[23:56] mikeric has joined the channel
[23:56] tjholowaychuk: to some degree at least
[23:56] jgallen23 has joined the channel
[23:56] Tobsn: maybe im injecting a javascript
[23:56] te-brian: tjholowaychuk: Agreed on both accounts.... though Drupal can become theme() soup
[23:56] Tobsn: that injects a javascript
[23:56] Tobsn: gonna try that right now
[23:56] Tobsn: just to make sure
[23:57] te-brian: tjholowaychuk: And you end up with 100 levels of divs :)
[23:57] tjholowaychuk: haha yeah that's brutal
[23:57] jerrysv: te-brian: maybe check out bricksjs? http://bricksjs.com/

[23:58] te-brian: tjholowaychuk: Quick google search not helping me clarify what you mean by 'mounting'
[23:58] jerrysv: te-brian: or more specifically: http://bricksjs.com/documentation.html
[23:58] tjholowaychuk: te-brian app.use('/blog', myblogapp)
[23:59] te-brian: tjholowaychuk: Thats middleware correct?
[23:59] tjholowaychuk: yup
[23:59] tjholowaychuk: well
[23:59] tjholowaychuk: myblogapp would be an express app
[23:59] tjholowaychuk: or node http server etc
[23:59] te-brian: tjholowaychuk: Conceptually similar to how cluster is an app.. that mounts an express app ?
