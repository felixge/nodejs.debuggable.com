[00:00] pHcF: tjholowaychuk: connect.sid is changing

[00:01] tjholowaychuk: pHcF: ok, then there is most likely a cookie issues. hmm

[00:01] SubStack: TDD is better suited for some problems than others
[00:01] dominictarr has joined the channel
[00:01] SubStack: it's rubbish for exploratory programming
[00:01] tim_smart: test driven development is hard when you are writing API wrappers.
[00:01] jonaslund: i can't imagine TDD for user interfaces :D
[00:01] ryah: SubStack: yes, obviously :)
[00:01] jonaslund: esp not if you have marketing people calling the shots
[00:01] pHcF: i have a method in my app that i need to get user's id (in session), and i have a infinite loading page (that you scroll and it loads more). the JSON that is downloaded when the user scrolls needs to have the session object (to get user data properly). the first time i scroll to the bottom, it loads nicely, but the second time, the session is reseted
[00:01] jonaslund: *nightmares*
[00:02] dominictarr: whenI imagine TDD for GUI I imagine actual users sitting somewhere
[00:02] tanepiper: jonaslund: Sencha have apparently worked on a headeless TDD app for the next ExtJS, based on reference images
[00:02] tjholowaychuk: tanepiper: they already kinda had that
[00:02] dominictarr: getting a and instruction "put the peg in the hole"
[00:02] dominictarr: and a GUI.
[00:02] SubStack: ryah: flashing your new badge I see!
[00:03] tjholowaychuk: tanepiper: not overly useful IMO though
[00:03] dominictarr: if they can do it, it's passed.
[00:03] tim_smart: @ badges are over rated.
[00:03] tanepiper: tjholowaychuk: ahh you would have seen it :D  yea, i just saw a bit of it in Ed Spencer's video from Senchacon
[00:04] ryah: it took me two years to get it
[00:04] tjholowaychuk: tanepiper: wouldnt be hard to implement
[00:04] Sebmaster: i just noticed, ive no ability to checkout a git
[00:04] Sebmaster: anyone an idea, how to get v8 without svn?
[00:05] pHcF: tjholowaychuk: any idea about the cookies issue?

[00:08] dominictarr: SubStack: how much of your codeing would you call 'exploratory'?
[00:09] tim_smart: NYCNodist: Google brought up https://github.com/jed/cookie-node

[00:10] SubStack: dominictarr: I usually will be hacking something up and it will bug me so then I modularize that part to contain the suck
[00:11] SubStack: I spend most of my time figuring out how the interface should look
[00:11] pHcF: i have a method in my app that i need to get user's id (in session), and i have a infinite loading page (that you scroll and it loads more). the JSON that is downloaded when the user scrolls needs to have the session object (to get user data properly). the first time i scroll to the bottom, it loads nicely, but the second time, the session is reseted
[00:11] SubStack: the api interface I mean, not in the graphical sense
[00:11] mjijackson: How does Node's HTTP parser respond when a request is malformed?
[00:12] dominictarr: yeah, interfaces. sometimes you build this big clever thing, and then discover you use it a different way.
[00:12] dominictarr: ...gave it the wrong interface
[00:12] DTrejo has joined the channel

[00:14] hangomanatee: Sorry about the confusion re: meetups
[00:14] Sebmaster: its the same error again tho
[00:14] SubStack: it's ok
[00:14] ryah: jonaslund: either is fine
[00:14] hangomanatee: I totally boned it, but the reorg of Meetup.com helped.
[00:15] EyePulp: whoa-  Schemas are required now in mongoose?
[00:15] hangomanatee: There's a meetup of the original group on the 15th.
[00:15] jonaslund: ok cool
[00:15] Sebmaster: guess ill look into the script more
[00:15] hangomanatee: At least I gto to hang with the ryah
[00:15] jonaslund: ryah: i'll make a small patch to avoid some dynamic lib linking with mingw that we found yesterday
[00:15] hangomanatee: who by the way is EVEN cooler than I imagined hed be.

[00:16] SubStack: ryah: nah I stayed home since I didn't hear back from hangomanatee
[00:16] SubStack: also I was pretty sleepy
[00:16] hangomanatee: fair enough.
[00:16] hangomanatee: I talked to the Hub today.
[00:16] hangomanatee: They're bookable for $250
[00:16] hangomanatee: but they have a nice space with a big projetor.
[00:17] SubStack: nice!
[00:17] hangomanatee: its not out of the question for me, if I can put a basket and get a little help from the community.
[00:17] hangomanatee: They actually have a gallery space next to the hub
[00:18] hangomanatee: so I won't technically have to put "The Hub" on the meetup invitation.

[00:26] NYCNodist: How do I get the raw cookies header?
[00:26] NYCNodist: request.what?
[00:27] Sebmaster: did you diff them?

[00:28] jonaslund: 10-15 changes in both since then
[00:28] hangomanatee: ryah: and SubStack: I have called the company Matt Humphrey, the Javascript meetup guy, works at to suggest he turn off the "suggest a meetup" feature on his site - thats the best I can do at this point.
[00:28] NYCNodist: Anyone?
[00:29] bingomanatee: NYCNodist - I think express exposes cookies for you easily
[00:29] nejucomo has joined the channel
[00:30] SubStack: hangomanatee: I think just a timely comment on the meetup page would have solved the confusion for me
[00:30] tjholowaychuk: bingomanatee / NYCNodist: yeah req.cookies
[00:30] tjholowaychuk: if you use cookieDecoder()
[00:30] NYCNodist: Ah thanks

[00:32] hangomanatee: At least we have a backup meetup for the Node Community :D
[00:32] Sebmaster: hmm
[00:32] Sebmaster: which version of v8 did v0.3.1 use?

[00:34] hangomanatee: no strings attached.

[00:35] SubStack: meeting with business types saps so much energy
[00:35] chapel: tjholowaychuk: with express/connect, is there a way to add routes into an array and then iterate over the array to do the app.get or whatever?
[00:35] hangomanatee: I doubt anyone will ever be able to beat my terms.
[00:35] SubStack: Everything is so early. Before noon even.
[00:36] tjholowaychuk: chapel: why no do exactly what you just mentioned?
[00:36] sprout has joined the channel
[00:36] NYCNodist: How do you grab a file sync into a variable using fs?
[00:36] chapel: well it doesn't seem to work
[00:36] tjholowaychuk: you can just iterate them and keep calling app.get()
[00:36] hangomanatee: I know two guys I can put your way.
[00:36] tjholowaychuk: hell at runtime you can add more routes dynamically if you wanted to
[00:36] hangomanatee: Gary Kremen for one
[00:36] Sebmaster: jonaslund: this diff could be a good start, will look through 2-3 more diffs tho https://github.com/v8/v8/commit/6beb8ee6222457facb4e868dec3dc4f60240198d#diff-1
[00:37] chapel: when I arr.forEach( function(route) { app.get(route, fn) } it doesn't register it
[00:37] hangomanatee: He founded Clean Power Finance when I was there - hes straight up.
[00:37] SubStack: hangomanatee: that would be excellent!

[00:44] techwraith: What's the best way to stop an error on a single request from taking down the whole node app?
[00:44] ryah: shaver, mnot: you guys might know this. are there any clients which make a http request and go half-duplex (shutdown write) before getting the response
[00:44] ryah: is this allowed?
[00:45] jonaslund: Sebmaster: interesting, that patch seems to be from pisci from this channel
[00:45] shaver: I don't know of any
[00:45] mnot: it's not unknown
[00:45] shaver: browsers, at least
[00:45] mnot: squid has code to deal with it
[00:45] shaver: I'm not sure why you would want to do that
[00:46] ryah: mnot: squid handles it as a server?
[00:46] mnot: yeah, IIRC
[00:46] mnot: sec
[00:46] mnot: http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/half_closed_clients/
[00:46] ryah: node also handles it - but it's creating some problems- and i'd liek to remove that behavior
[00:47] mnot: http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/InnerWorkings#What_is_a_half-closed_filedescriptor.3F
[00:48] NYCNodist: Hmm, how do you sync read a file with node?
[00:48] shaver: readFileSync
[00:48] tanepiper: wait, what? https://github.com/visionmedia/node-querystring  i thought querystring was staying in 0.3.6 > ?
[00:48] NYCNodist: ok
[00:48] ryah: default is that they do not allow it
[00:48] ryah: okay
[00:49] Sebmaster: jonaslund: I'm unable to build it with the commit from October 25, 2010
[00:49] ryah: mnot: thanks for the link
[00:49] richcollins has joined the channel
[00:49] ryah: i'll also make it optional in node
[00:49] mnot: np
[00:49] Sebmaster: but that was wayy before node 0.3.1
[00:49] techwraith: No info on how to catch http server errors so it doesn't take down the whole server?
[00:49] ryah: tanepiper: it is
[00:49] Tom-: Q: if I do a string.indexOf('\n'); is it possible that this will not hit on a carriage return (enter) but on a literal "\n" character combination?
[00:50] Tom-: or are those two the same?
[00:50] jonaslund: Sebmaster: was that version also due to python errors ?
[00:50] tanepiper: ryah: ahh cool, tj must be confused :D
[00:50] Sebmaster: jonaslund: ye
[00:50] jonaslund: hmm
[00:51] Sebmaster: i guess im doing something wrong
[00:51] Sebmaster: because that patch is version 2.5.1
[00:51] brianc: NYCNodist: did you find what you were looking for with the postgres client?
[00:51] Sebmaster: and node 0.3.1 with v8 2.5.3 built fine
[00:52] mnot: ryah: btw, the only time I've found turning that setting on useful in the past is when I need a reverse proxy to continue reading a response into cache even when the client times out before it gets headers.
[00:52] NYCNodist: brianc: I think so
[00:52] booths: Tom- what are you trying to do? Just see if there's one in the string, or replace it, or what?
[00:52] NYCNodist: But can someone link me to node-postgres again?
[00:52] Sebmaster: maybe its a strange coincidence
[00:52] Sebmaster: because im still using node master
[00:52] NYCNodist: like on github
[00:52] brianc: https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres
[00:52] Tom-: booths: I am streaming a file and checking every line by looking for the carriage return
[00:53] brianc: NYCNodist: you can also use google for "node postgres"
[00:53] Sebmaster: ill revert back to 0.3.1 and just upgrade v8 from there
[00:53] alek_br has joined the channel
[00:53] Tom-: booths: if the carriage return is not present, I add the string to the buffer and check back later when I have more data
[00:53] Tom-: booths: but with big files something goes wrong, I think it has to do with the \n search
[00:54] booths: Tom- If someone types "\n" it would match \\n, not \n
[00:54] Tom-: booths: alright, so that cannot be the cause of my problem then
[00:54] dustinwhittle has joined the channel
[00:54] booths: at least in v8 in the browser
[00:55] booths: test it in the repl
[00:55] booths: I think it will depend on where you get the information.
[00:56] booths: If you create a string with "\n" it will match the newline, but if you're pulling from like a textarea, something typed \n will match \\n
[00:56] dominictarr: so you test when you "modularize that part to contain the suck"

[01:01] Tom-: that is interesting though
[01:02] booths: Okay, reading from a text file, \\n is a typed \n, and \n is a physical newline
[01:02] booths: in 3.5
[01:02] ryah: mjr_: 'error' or 'abort' ?
[01:03] Sebmaster: ryah: Did you at deps/v8/src/plattform_cygwin.cc until node v0.3.1 manually?
[01:04] booths: Tom- I created a .txt file with \n typed and a couple regular \n, I can use .split(/\n/)

[01:05] Tom-: booths: yeah, it works for me as well, until I have passed a like 7000 lines it seems to go wrong
[01:05] Tom-: I am trying to pin down the root of the problem
[01:05] ryah: Sebmaster: ?
[01:05] Tom-: but am unsuccesful, maybe it is something else
[01:06] booths: so your strings are terminated by a \n?
[01:06] Sebmaster: Did you at deps/v8/src/plattform_cygwin.cc until node v0.3.1 manually?
[01:06] booths: that's how you know it's done, essentially?
[01:08] Tom-: booths: the fields are yes, it's a comma-separated-file where fields are separated with a \n

[01:50] ncb000gt: dominictarr: ~/.npmrc
[01:50] ncb000gt: dominictarr: or do you mean, it actually processes that file in?
[01:50] dominictarr: the second.
[01:50] qschzt: jonaslund, "actual games"? :-D
[01:51] techwraith: in node, what does 'timer' get set to when: var timer = setTimeout(foo(),3000);  ?
[01:51] qschzt: ncb, SS?
[01:51] techwraith: It seems to be getting set to an object, not a number for me
[01:51] ncb000gt: qschzt: server side
[01:52] techwraith: in which case, how does one clearTimeout() it?
[01:52] ncb000gt: for instance, cheat protection
[01:52] qschzt: ncb, yeah, we used to run most parts of the system in Scala before moving to Node.
[01:52] ncb000gt: dominictarr: not sure but there is a config.js file in lib/
[01:52] ncb000gt: qschzt: gotcha, cool
[01:52] ncb000gt: :)
[01:52] dominictarr: I want my code to know the npm root, is and i figure npm should be able to tell me.

[01:54] rchavik has joined the channel
[01:54] vnguyen has joined the channel
[01:55] ncb000gt: techwraith: first, you shouldn't call foo in there (unless foo returns a function), second, it returns an object

[01:55] siong1987 has joined the channel
[01:55] ncb000gt: techwraith: have you tried clearTimeout(timer)
[01:55] ncb000gt: ?
[01:56] techwraith: Yep, doesn't seem to clear it
[01:56] ncb000gt: techwraith: does for me
[01:56] techwraith: then again, it could be scope issues, I'm setting the timeout in one method of an object and clearing it in a few others
[01:57] ncb000gt: tho, I used setInterval to test it out
[01:57] ncb000gt: techwraith: it also worked for me with setTimeout
[01:58] ncb000gt: techwraith: when i attempted it in a node repl
[01:58] ncb000gt: so i suspect you're right about scoping
[01:58] techwraith: yeah, it's working for me too, it's definitely scoping

[02:06] DTrejo: has anyone seen an intro to a technology that they really loved, that might be a good model?
[02:08] ncb000gt: DTrejo: is this supposed to be a full intro site, book, article?
[02:08] ncb000gt: DTrejo: seems like a lot of information for a single article/post
[02:09] DTrejo: ncb000gt: good question, I'm not totally sure. I think the main point is to have something maintained on nodejs.org that newcomers can read get an intro to node.

[02:11] ncb000gt: DTrejo: cool. outside of those details, try just telling a story

[02:58] harth has joined the channel
[02:59] qschzt: the crash is a node-side issue

[03:07] ncb000gt: qschzt: strange. do you have the same version of node on your mac and on linux?
[03:08] benburkert has joined the channel
[03:08] jonaslund: could be different stdlibs, compilers,etc
[03:08] Tom-: ncb000gt: do you know in what file I can find the source for the resume method?
[03:08] qschzt: ncb, yeah yeah all the same versions, 0.2.6, 1.7.5 mongodb ..
[03:08] ncb000gt: Tom-: Take a look at the net code...I believe that is where Stream is defined.
[03:09] qschzt: jonaslund is probably right, stdlib??
[03:09] jonaslund: btw.. could node become compiled as x64 ?
[03:09] dnyy has joined the channel
[03:09] Tom-: ncb000gt: hmm, cannot find it there
[03:09] qschzt: the same node-mongodb-native version runs on both, the other returns the cursor and can iterate, the other never returns the cursor before crashing with the size of the result set
[03:09] ncb000gt: jonaslund: it wouldn't run if it was compiled for x64 and trying to run on 32bit
[03:10] jonaslund: ncb000gt: what i mean is maybe his mac and linux version are compiled for different targets  and exposes a pointer-size bug somewhere
[03:10] ncb000gt: jonaslund: good call, i thought you meant something else, carry on! :)

[03:32] qschzt: I can say V8's GC is incredible, having ported a Rhino setup to Node - load went way, way below a tenth
[03:34] qschzt: overall what's happened in the last year in Node is incredible, now I'm mainly lacking profiling tools - the Node stack hasn't crashed on me for ages

[03:36] ncb000gt: qschzt: yea, i tend to do some of that myself, but it's still early
[03:37] ncb000gt: qschzt: one of the good and bad things is that the library set wasn't developed

[03:39] ncb000gt: qschzt: there is a migration article on the wiki
[03:40] mscdex: qschzt: you can take snapshots of the heap with node-profiler
[03:40] ryah: qschzt: https://github.com/ry/node/wiki/Migrating-from-v0.2-to-v0.3
[03:40] qschzt: thanks and thanks
[03:41] mikeal: pushed more changes to http://search.npmjs.org/
[03:41] bradleymeck: can i just post a huge amount of "teaching" in the docs to help people understand the how and why of things async. I have em written out
[03:41] ncb000gt: qschzt: there are also dtrace bindings that you can look into
[03:41] mikeal: we've got 1046 modules
[03:41] mikeal: that's crazy
[03:42] ryah: mikeal: crazy
[03:42] ryah: i want someone to run 'make test-all' tests for 0.3.8 on macintosh
[03:42] ryah: please
[03:42] qschzt: will do
[03:42] bradleymeck: do you need any windows tests run?

[03:45] chapel: mikeal: what is the best way to store a date when creating a document in couchdb using node?
[03:45] qschzt: when is the new stable due?
[03:45] chapel: just new Date() ?
[03:46] mikeal: if you pass a new Date() object to JavaScript's JSON.stringify it'll convert it to a UTC string
[03:46] qschzt: 2.5 -> 2.6 solved a huge amount of memory leaks btw in production
[03:46] mikeal: so it's perfect
[03:46] mikeal: other languages you have to be careful tho and do conversions
[03:46] chapel: "datetime":"2011-02-05T03:44:48.070Z"
[03:46] chapel: so thats what should be expected?
[03:46] mikeal: yeah, that's exactly what you want
[03:46] mikeal: that will sort properly
[03:46] mikeal: if you emit it in a view or anything like that
[03:46] chapel: okay cool
[03:46] chapel: just making sure
[03:46] chapel: :)
[03:48] qschzt: we had pretty bad memory leaks in 0.2.3, actually, moving straight to 0.2.6 was painless, and suddenly the GC could run better?

[04:02] qschzt: ryah, core build test-all failed on Mac, big problem IMHO
[04:02] qschzt: and on linux
[04:02] ncb000gt: qschzt: due to the tick issue right?
[04:02] qschzt: yes
[04:03] ncb000gt: er, tick test
[04:03] ryah: qschzt: i could just disable the test - it would still be broken :)
[04:03] ncb000gt: i saw the same behavior here
[04:03] ryah: better to keep it reminding me
[04:03] ncb000gt: lol
[04:03] qschzt: why?
[04:03] ryah: it's a bug
[04:03] qschzt: what bug?
[04:03] ryah: don't worry - there are thousands of bugs in node
[04:04] qschzt: can I RT u?

[04:06] mikeal: i can write a patch
[04:06] qschzt: actually I have no pressing Node bugs in 0.2.6 so I'll step aside
[04:06] mikeal: but i'm wondering how you want to do it
[04:06] ryah: mikeal: that'd be nice
[04:06] mikeal: can we just use http.Agent in https
[04:06] mikeal: or keep them seperate but use a consistent API
[04:06] ryah: mikeal: not exactly - it needs to overload one method
[04:06] mikeal: and if so, which API :)
[04:07] mikeal: ok, i'll use inherits
[04:07] mikeal: do you want to move both to the options style

[04:27] chapel: I am assigning local variables to those methods from the class this.options
[04:27] Mike_Rice: indexzero: link?
[04:27] indexzero: chapel: ok, can you just assign class variables via the constructor that way?
[04:28] indexzero: Mike_Rice: The slides / code are on Github: http://github.com/indexzero/nodejs-intro
[04:28] chapel: yeah indexzero at least that is what it shows in the docs
[04:28] chapel: http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/#classes
[04:28] Mike_Rice: indexzero: sorry, I completely misunderstood you
[04:28] Mike_Rice: indexzero: i thought you were implying a mike rice reviewed your tutorial, LOL
[04:28] chapel: but what I dont understand is why the local options to the method is being sent to the class this.options
[04:29] Mike_Rice: indexzero: I guess it's time for bed for me...
[04:29] chapel: so doing .create and then .update the update is getting the changes from the .create
[04:29] Mike_Rice: Long week...
[04:30] indexzero: Mike_Rice: I hear ya
[04:30] indexzero: chapel: Line 8 is the cause of this
[04:30] indexzero: chapel: options = @options won't clone the @options object, it will just set the reference
[04:30] chapel: I think I am mis understanding something simple, but I want to be able to take this.options and assign it to a local method variable that is only usable in that method
[04:31] chapel: ah
[04:31] Mike_Rice: indexzero: does your http-agent run on 0.2.6?

[04:33] indexzero: Mike_Rice: I'm really happy about default pooling, but if it's not 100% yet that's good to know

[05:55] Ond: Of course the library would be accessible to other JVM languages as they all have access to java libraries. Ideally, Scala or Clojure would be used.
[05:56] charlenopires has joined the channel
[05:56] dominic_: Scala & Clojure are MUCH cooler than java.
[05:56] Ond: And yeah, you could run a .js file much like node
[05:57] Ond: Ringo is CommonJS compliant
[05:57] Ond: I guess. The next version of Java should be alright (probably)
[05:57] shaver: could use rhino
[05:57] Ond: Well, RingoJS uses Rhino.
[05:57] shaver: well then
[05:57] Ond: But Rhino hasn't been modified in quite a while.
[05:57] dominic_: ha! they have been talking about add closures for years!
[05:57] dominic_: (to java that is)
[05:57] Ond: Yeah dominic_
[05:57] Ond: Fingers crossed
[05:58] jimt_ has joined the channel
[05:58] dominic_: it's like php has closures in 5.3 but it's not compatible with 95% of the ecosystem... so no one uses it.
[05:58] sholmes: could Node eventually move on to being a front-end application framework?
[05:58] shaver: it already is in WebOS
[05:59] bradleymeck: until php can GC a fing function its dead to me
[05:59] sholmes: shaver, oh rly?
[05:59] dominic_: you could use one of those naked browsers and it would be great.
[05:59] shaver: sholmes: yeah
[05:59] sholmes: so webOS devices can except HTTP requests?

[06:25] hangomanatee: A friend of mine found a Java exploit that allowed him to rape anyone's browser once they visited his site, and force them to serve any file on their hard drive to the outside world.
[06:26] hangomanatee: (til they shut the browser.)
[06:26] shaver: java is a disaster
[06:26] shaver: biggest security issue we face
[06:26] hangomanatee: That got him an article in the WSJ and he flipped that publicity into an apartment.
[06:26] hangomanatee: Potentially - though I thought client side Java was pretty much dead.

[08:28] Jonasbn_: Hi guys. When starting a node server I'm getting "Your node instance does not have root privileges"
[08:29] Jonasbn_: I obviously don't, if I'm using sudo, but if I do so, socket.io refuses to work.
[08:29] Jonasbn_: Any ideas on how to solve it? :)
[08:29] rot13 has joined the channel
[08:30] dominic_: you can't open port 80 without root.
[08:30] dominic_: thats my guess.
[08:31] sherzod: another guess is that maybe port is already opened and busy
[08:31] sherzod: and that is why socket.io is not working
[08:31] Jonasbn_: Let me check the web server in osx
[08:32] dominic_: hmm. or socket.io doesn't want to run in sudo for security.
[08:32] mscdex: no, it's trying to open port 843 for Flash
[08:32] dominic_: any port under 1000 needs root
[08:32] Jonasbn_: socket.io runs fine, but the client cannot access it

[09:27] mikeal: mscdex: that's harder than you think
[09:27] mscdex: :S
[09:27] mikeal: because it's as you type, and the responses come back async
[09:28] tanepiper: THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID
[09:28] mscdex: wait, she knows about async programming?
[09:28] mikeal: so a response might mean it's done, or it doesn't
[09:28] mikeal: because you already typed more
[09:29] tanepiper: mikeal: open source?  i'd like to see how your handling all the url variations like homepage/url/repo.web/repo.url, etc
[09:29] mikeal: most of what i'm trying to improve is browsing modules
[09:29] mikeal: tanepiper: lots of crazy jquery :)
[09:30] mikeal: tanepiper: https://github.com/mikeal/js-registry/tree/master/ui

[09:50] dominictarr: people who use gmail wonder why other people complain about email stuff.

[13:11] franck34: i'm testing node 0.3 for SSL stuff
[13:11] franck34: i'm using "connect" too
[13:12] franck34: question: how to setup ssl using "connect". I've read http://www.loggly.com/2010/09/node-js-ssl-server-example/, now i'm looking/trying to understand how i can do that using "connect"
[13:12] franck34: https://github.com/senchalabs/connect
[13:12] franck34: any help is welcome, thanks a lot ;)
[13:13] franck34: (got my private key, server key, credential object is ok, now just looking how to setSecure the http server of the objet returned by "connect"
[13:14] franck34: is "visionmedia" from github in the room ?
[13:19] Poetro: franck34: $ npm view connect maintainers
[13:20] franck34: Poetro: thx
[13:24] Remoun has joined the channel
[13:24] Poetro: franck34: as i c from https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/master/lib/connect/index.js it doesnt support SSL atm

[13:33] franck34: can't

[13:34] Poetro: so it is not that easy

[13:34] Poetro: franck34: you'd have to switch larger parts of connect before even initialize the connection

[14:34] Tom-_: franck34: yes, writing works just fine
[14:35] franck34: k
[14:35] Tom-_: franck34: it all works, but the stream.destroy() causes a EBADFD error when the input stream finished and I stopped writing
[14:36] franck34: can you test what append if you move writeStream.removeAllListeners('drain'); AFTER end/destroy
[14:36] franck34: ?
[14:38] Tom-_: franck34: alright, but I cannot see how that would influence anything - it merely removes an element from an array

[14:47] franck34: Tom-_: i don't know, but perhaps .end() is closing the stream AND destroy the stream, so you are trying to destroy an already destroyed stream

[19:25] WatermelonStorm: ...
[19:25] WatermelonStorm: farhadi: You're looking at the client library.
[19:26] WatermelonStorm: Which DOES have a disconnect method. Spacerat_ wants the server to have a disconnect method.
[19:26] WatermelonStorm: So it can force a client to disconnect.

[20:04] stride: :) no problem
[20:04] larsemil: franck34: wonderful.
[20:04] franck34: larsemil: that's what i'm using, it's one of the way
[20:04] franck34: thx maritz :)
[20:05] maritz: franck34: np. ;)
[20:05] larsemil: franck34: do i need to run socket.io on the server then as well?
[20:05] maritz: if you pass a string it's not automagically taken as a regex
[20:05] maritz: larsemil: you don't _need_ to, but it's rather convenient. :D
[20:05] stride: larsemil: or just plain old xmlhttprequests if you don't need to push from the server / want the 'realtime' buzzword for your app :)
[20:06] franck34: larsemil: yes it's better, because socket need some js files, and socket.io already take care of that. But you can make js files loaded yourself too

[20:07] stride: (iirc)
[20:10] larsemil: stride: is Socket.IO-node something else then Socket.IO?
[20:10] maritz: it's the node.js (server) part.
[20:10] larsemil: i dont understand.
[20:10] larsemil: and in that example, what is express?
[20:11] maritz: Socket.IO is for the browser, Socket.IO-node is for the server. (at least afaik)
[20:11] stride: express is a framework for webapps, takes care of request routing etc
[20:11] larsemil: okey.
[20:11] larsemil: well i am not writing a webb app.
[20:11] stride: if you want something smaller, I'd suggest following the code snippets on the socket.io website (they had some serverside stuff there as well) and debugging from there ;)
[20:11] larsemil: i need a tcp server listening and sending some data
[20:11] franck34: hehe. Patched connect.session to update the session only when uri match some regexp

[20:13] tfe_ has joined the channel
[20:13] stride: so, no, not really
[20:14] larsemil: okay.
[20:14] stride: the upside of socket.io is that it offers fallback "transports" (from xmlhttprequest to an embedded flash object) for incapable browsers, as well as the serverside stuff you
[20:15] stride: and then you just use one common interface on both sides, without worrying about the transport
[20:15] larsemil: only thing i need to send are some variables. like one struct from client to server and another one from server to client.
[20:16] stride: multiple times? or just once per page view?
[20:16] larsemil: stride: lots and lots of times
[20:17] stride: hmkay, yeah, socket.io would still be a good choice there imho
[20:18] larsemil: okay. will look into it. rather new to js so its a bumpy road.. :D
[20:18] stride: if you want some more introductory stuff  on socket.io, there should be blogposts on it at howtonode.org and a few video sessions at camp.nodejs.org

[23:20] mikeal: because i have to run adium anyway
[23:20] mape: >_<
[23:20] JohnnyL has joined the channel
[23:20] mape: why not go all bat shit crazy and use the browser?
[23:20] mikeal: the browser is full of productive stuff too
[23:20] mikeal: docs and sites in development
[23:20] mikeal: i have two workspaces
[23:21] mikeal: one has iterm2, textmate, and chrome
[23:21] mape: so in the end you'll end up with irc alongside the shitter? :P
[23:21] mikeal: the other has Postbox, twitter, and adium
[23:22] mape: mikeal: so how does the workspaces matter at all? I assume you get a visual/audio queue if someone hilights you?
[23:22] mikeal: it's a growl notification that i ignore
[23:22] mikeal: if i don't want to be distracted
[23:23] mape: So having a terminal in the background that you never see because there are windows ontop is a pita, but growl notifications is a ok?
[23:23] mikeal: no no no
[23:23] mikeal: i will see it
[23:23] mikeal: because development is a process of cmd+tab between Chrome, iTerm and TextMate
[23:24] mikeal: so if distracting things are behind them I'll see them when i flip through
[23:24] mape: how is that more distacting then a growl notification?=
[23:24] mape: sounds more like something you made up in your head?
[23:24] mikeal: because the top right of the screen never has anything important in it
[23:24] mape: which I guess is as good reason as anything..
[23:24] mikeal: i've had growl for like 5 years
[23:24] mikeal: i'm used to ignoring them when i'm busy
[23:25] mape: the terminal for less?
[23:25] mape: hmm k
[23:25] mikeal: the terminal forever, but I have to look at the terminal
[23:25] mikeal: for important things, like writing code
[23:25] zemanel: doesnt haml-js support internet unexplorer conditionals?
[23:25] mikeal: so i need to keep distractions out of it
[23:25] mape: mikeal: btw why tm if you use terminal for code?
[23:26] mikeal: textmate is great
[23:26] mikeal: for refactoring i want good select and indent support
[23:26] zemanel: TextWrangler
[23:26] mikeal: that shit is annoying in vi
[23:26] mikeal: but, i still edit config files in vi
[23:26] mikeal: without actually thinking about it
[23:26] mape: I just hope kod turns out
[23:26] mikeal: me too
[23:27] mikeal: once it hits feature parity with textmate i'll switch
[23:27] mikeal: or at least has the features i care about
[23:27] mape: as soon as I can select+alt+tab I'll switch
[23:28] mape: waiting 10min for tm to not stay frozen because of a off site search is silly
[23:28] mape: if anything for other project files
[23:30] mikeal: it needs like, a prefs pane
[23:30] bingomanatee has left the channel
[23:30] mikeal: so i can select a font
[23:30] mape: hehe isn't that by design?
[23:30] mape: sane defaults, hackers gonna be hacking so use conf files
[23:30] mikeal: that's dump
[23:30] shaver: nobody wants to type in font names
[23:30] mikeal: just give me a prefs window
[23:31] mape: ACTION gives mikeal a prefs window
[23:31] mikeal: s/dump/dumb
[23:31] shaver: take my prefs window...please!
[23:31] mikeal: if i wanted to spend all my time editing config files by hand
[23:31] mikeal: i'd run linux
[23:31] sudoer has joined the channel
[23:32] mape: but yeah, seems some configuration won't work with pref windows
[23:32] dominictarr has joined the channel
[23:32] mape: but the basics should
[23:32] JohnnyL has left the channel
[23:32] mikeal: i do like the idea of having node be my scripting language for the editor
[23:32] mikeal: editing textmate plugins is aweful
[23:32] richcollins has joined the channel
[23:32] mikeal: it's all bash and ruby
[23:33] shaver: two great tastes that...gaaaaaak

[23:44] aaronblohowiak has joined the channel
[23:44] aaronblohowiak: who has access to nodejs.org? http://nodejs.org/api.html is the top google result for node api and it is neither stable nor latest
[23:45] mikeal: i think only ryah has access
[23:45] dxld has joined the channel
[23:46] aaronblohowiak: mikeal: okie dokie.  i have brought this to his attention in the past, but i know he is crazy busy
[23:47] mikeal: i think the plan is to move over to the new docs at 0.4.0 anyway
[23:47] mikeal: that's probably why it's old
[23:47] aaronblohowiak: mikeal: yea, if it was stable, that'd also be fine
[23:47] aaronblohowiak: but being at 0.3.0 is the worst of both worlds, y aknow
[23:48] mikeal: yeah, the issue is that the new doc system started right after 0.3.0 got released
[23:48] aaronblohowiak: heard.
[23:48] mikeal: and 0.3.0 is actually the exact same API as the latest 0.2
[23:48] aaronblohowiak: mikeal: ah, that i did not figure
[23:49] aaronblohowiak: mikeal: when do you start @ yammer ?
[23:50] lukegalea has joined the channel
[23:50] mikeal: monday
[23:50] aaronblohowiak: oh, v. cool.  i think my friend Dixie starts the week after. she's a radsauce rails developer
[23:51] xonecas has joined the channel
[23:52] mikeal: cool
[23:52] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[23:53] xonecas: might be an odd place to ask, but anyone has worked with the twitter streaming api, the statuses/filter method?
[23:55] aaronblohowiak: Is there a way to mix in the contents of a require()'d module into the global scope more cleanly than this: https://gist.github.com/fa4f9f2ca03591b9de57
[23:56] SubStack: global scope /o\
[23:56] mikeal: xonecas: a little
[23:56] mikeal: i have a library that is out of date
[23:56] mikeal: marcos has a better, newer one
[23:56] mikeal: https://github.com/polotek/evented-twitter
[23:56] xonecas: mikeal: can I use statuses/filter to return only geotagged tweets ?
[23:56] mikeal: there's marco's lib
[23:57] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: good point, perhaps i should use the current module
[23:58] mikeal: aaronblohowiak: no there isn't, and that way might breat
[23:58] mikeal: er break
[23:58] SubStack: aaronblohowiak: maybe just do var assert = require('wrapperthing')(require('assert'))
[23:58] SubStack: or else wrapperthing could do that itself
[23:59] aaronblohowiak: SubStack: oooh, that would be neat.  addObjectContentsToCurrentScope()
[23:59] aaronblohowiak: ;)
[23:59] SubStack: current scope sounds scary!
