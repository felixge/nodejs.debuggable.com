[00:03] qcom: tjholowaychuk: hey, what do I need to add to my express server file to connect stylus to nib?
[00:03] tim_smart: For every line I write, I delete 2 lines ^^
[00:03] quackslike: tim_smart: lol
[00:03] tim_smart: 2.5 lines rather
[00:03] tjholowaychuk: qcom: you'll need the "compile" option for the stylus middleware
[00:03] tjholowaychuk: and within that
[00:03] tjholowaychuk: add stylus(str).use(nib())...otherstuff..
[00:03] qcom: oh ok
[00:04] gf3: tjholowaychuk: parser.js is the prettiest auto-generated code I have ever seen
[00:04] qcom: thanks, and I think I found a good example with your finance app
[00:04] tjholowaychuk: gf3: ahaha thanks
[00:04] tjholowaychuk: beats writing it all by hand

[00:10] tjholowaychuk: its madness
[00:11] doctorm: I'm having some trouble understanding how n is supposed to work. I installed node 0.5.0 and npm, but some of the packages I need are restricted to 0.4.7. After installing n as a user and changing N_PREFIX so it points to a user directory, I  install 0.4.7 successfully. How do I make it so that is the default node binary to use for this user account? Is that built into n or do I do it manually?
[00:12] ji0n has joined the channel
[00:12] tjholowaychuk: gf3: doesn't look like it uses functions for recursion so it's probably faster
[00:12] tjholowaychuk: i'll try it out
[00:12] tjholowaychuk: however does not look fun to debug haha
[00:12] gf3: heh
[00:13] gf3: well thankfully it has pretty good error reporting
[00:13] gf3: also inimino and azatoth are usually around to bug
[00:15] gf3: tjholowaychuk: I kind of like a separate walking phase, because things can get pretty hairy when the grammar rules and parsing logic are mixed
[00:15] gf3: although your example is clean and easy to understand
[00:16] yhahn has left the channel
[00:16] tjholowaychuk: that's the point of a recursive descent parser, it uses recursion to apply the rules
[00:16] tjholowaychuk: nothing wrong with that
[00:16] tjholowaychuk: it's just one of the many alternatives
[00:16] Marak: hey guys
[00:16] Marak: im writing this blog article right now, could someone succintly explain to me how to say this statement is wrong: "node solves the problem by changing how a connection is made to the server. Instead of spawning a new OS thread for each connection (and allocating the accompanying memory with it), each connection creates a process, which doesn't require the memory block to go with it."
[00:16] themiddleman_itv has joined the channel
[00:16] tjholowaychuk: just like you could say mixing the lexer with the parser is "bad"
[00:16] Marak: tjholowaychuk: ?
[00:17] tjholowaychuk: sorry haha talking to gf3
[00:17] Marak: the word "process" there bothers me
[00:17] Marak: tjholowaychuk:  i know, im just harrassing you
[00:17] doctorm: Also, what's the most common practice for mapping domains to node servers? I'm used to apache, but I was just going to use node-http-proxy as a reverse proxy. Is this kosher?
[00:17] Marak: doctorm: dude, use haibu
[00:17] Marak: doctorm: for real
[00:17] Marak: https://github.com/nodejitsu/haibu
[00:18] doctorm: Marak: hadn't heard of that, just getting started exploring node recently, thanks
[00:18] Marak: doctorm: its our application server built on top of httpProxy
[00:18] Marak: doctorm: we working on the CLI tool now, but haibu is super powerful
[00:18] Marak: new release, but we use it in production
[00:18] gf3: tjholowaychuk: of course, just personal preference when it comes to code maintenance
[00:19] doctorm: Marak: Sounds good, might be overkill for just getting a domain mapped on my personal VM ;) But I'll check it out.

[00:45] tjholowaychuk: yup
[00:45] xeodox: tjholowaychuk: Right now for every controller, I copy and paste the middleware to it.  But I don't want to do that. Instead I want to have one line that automatically tells all the controllers to hit that middleware first.
[00:45] tjholowaychuk: xeodox: then yeah just add an app.use(whatever)
[00:45] xeodox: ahh ok. 
[00:46] tjholowaychuk: before app.use(app.router) (if you even have this)

[01:36] chunhao: how can I listen to the 'open' event in mongoosejs?
[01:36] arthur_kalm: hey, quick question. npm pre 1.0 had the npm bundle command that'd pull down your dependencies declared in your package.json locally. That command is gone in 1.0, what do I use instead?
[01:37] pyrotechnick: Marak: use quickmeme next time, but sweet article bro
[01:37] isaacs: arthur_kalm: use "install"
[01:37] LukeGalea_: arthur_kalm: just npm install
[01:37] demastrie has joined the channel
[01:37] LukeGalea_: you have to say -g to be the global(ie. non bundle) version
[01:37] Marak: lol thanks
[01:37] arthur_kalm: is the version required now?
[01:37] Marak: you guys rock
[01:37] Marak: i just couldnt let IBM shit on everyone here

[01:38] LukeGalea_: isaacs: So you saw how many failures I got during my install.  But when I do an npm install, it says very little.. and npm install a third time says nothing at all

[01:39] Marak: ACTION says, "I'm trolling at optimal efficiency" 
[01:39] arthur_kalm: isaacs: sorry, I should make my question a bit more explicit. Does the package.json require a version number for the dependencies now?
[01:39] Marak: :-D
[01:39] arthur_kalm: before you could just leave the version blank and it'd pull down the latest
[01:39] quackslike: Marak: you posted something about writing a new blog entry to the nodejs list.. is that article done? it interested me but i cant remember what it was about..
[01:40] LukeGalea_: isaacs: That shows a whole bunch of "already installed"s, even though the installs had failed horribly.

[01:47] arthur_kalm: tonymilne: lol
[01:47] tonymilne: I don't want to troll them, but I kinda agree with you Marak that IBM is a big deal, and it's not awesome of them to publish mis-informed articles like that one.
[01:47] arthur_kalm: isaacs: ok, perhaps npmjs.org is slow right now?
[01:47] Marak: tonymilne: yeah man...its a community based site though, so IBM isnt directly responsible , but that domain carries serious weight
[01:48] arthur_kalm: tonymilne: unfortunately, a lot of developer works articles aren't very well done

[02:03] jhurliman: Marak, you're lucky ibm doesn't care about node. in my experience, if ibm *does* like your open source project things get a lot worse :)
[02:03] arthur_kalm: does it make sense to use something like jade? if most of the page will be updated using JS and events from socket.io

[03:04] Marak: try forever help
[03:04] draginx: forever help gives me same error lol =x
[03:04] Marak: one sec
[03:04] Marak: reinstalling it from npm to double check
[03:04] draginx: it could be my nodejs version...
[03:05] Marak: draginx: forever --help
[03:05] Marak: ?
[03:05] Marak: forever -h ?
[03:05] draginx: forever -h worked
[03:05] Marak: my local npm is borked on this machine actually, unrelated issue
[03:05] draginx: and there we go :) works good now
[03:05] Marak: draginx: you gotta read the docs, ill make sure we get commits landed to fix that stuff, its a very minor issue
[03:06] gkatsev: Marak: /lastlog topic
[03:06] gkatsev: oops
[03:06] draginx: hmm but its not actually running the file xD lol
[03:06] Marak: draginx: i HIGHLY recommend using github issues. if you file something on our projects, im gonna try to respond in < 5 minutes
[03:06] gkatsev: Marak: sorry :)
[03:06] draginx: Marak: thanks :) will keep in mind if i run into anything else
[03:06] phiggins: is there a tell bot in here?

[03:07] gkatsev: wow, that log is exremely up-to-date
[03:07] tbranyen: yeah lol
[03:07] phiggins: oh marak is no longer jimbastard
[03:07] draginx: is there a way for me to list all of the require('') "commands" that I can do?
[03:07] Marak: phiggins: people love to see a good story about change
[03:07] tbranyen: jimbastard wasn't a very becoming nick anyways
[03:08] Marak: phiggins: you gotta start somewhere and end up somewhere else
[03:08] phiggins: jimbastard: http://blog.nodejitsu.com/ibm-doesnt-care-about-nodejs-people is wrong
[03:08] draginx: just tried npm -g install express but express isn't showing up (when i do require('express')
[03:08] Marak: phiggins: ahahaha sorry
[03:08] phiggins: i don't see a way to comment
[03:08] Marak: phiggins: it might not be IBM's fault, but i can't have that coming up in google search results
[03:08] phiggins: and there's too much negativity in the overall js world right now to make a stink
[03:08] phiggins: but understand a)
[03:08] mertonium has joined the channel
[03:08] phiggins: ibm dev works !== ibm
[03:09] Marak: phiggins: i understand, i wasnt trying to bring negative attention to JS at all
[03:09] phiggins: don't call out ibm as a tech company on some random division that publishes mostly jqueryftw articles
[03:09] Marak: phiggins: i just have little tolerance for crap being published in the name of node. imagine you had never heard of anything before, and that IBM article was the FIRST thing you read
[03:10] willwhite has joined the channel
[03:10] Marak: phiggins: i understand im being harsh on IBM :-( 
[03:10] Marak: phiggins: and im sorry if i made you mad. you are like a js demi-god to me
[03:10] Marak: :-(
[03:10] phiggins: i have little tolerance for crap being published too but that doesn't stop it from happening
[03:11] phiggins: and maybe ubervocal is a way to be but I am against that
[03:11] phiggins: you didn't make me mad
[03:11] phiggins: just know ibm probably cares a lot more about node[cloud]js than you think

[03:12] phiggins: whoever wrote that particular article was some random paid someone
[03:12] Marak: yeah i know
[03:12] phiggins: didn't even find a link right off
[03:12] phiggins: i've bitched at devworks editors directly before, "this is sooooo 2005, plz stop"
[03:12] phiggins: it's just business there. but again devworks !== IBM, inc.

[03:15] phiggins: yes
[03:15] phiggins: it makes me sad. 
[03:15] AAA_awright: Module != npm package, people
[03:15] Marak: phiggins: i kinda disagree, ive seen a lot of awesome stuff coming out
[03:15] tbranyen: phiggins: probably because people are getting butthurt and keeping too much pride
[03:15] Marak: phiggins: lots of new developers too

[03:16] Marak: phiggins: we are working on a lot of really solid tools too, to help people do all sorts of neat node stuff

[03:18] Marak: draginx: did you install with -g ? there are some problems with migrating from old npm to new
[03:19] Marak: draginx: you might have to clear that lib/node_modules folder and reinstall npm
[03:19] Marak: dont listen to me though
[03:19] tbranyen: tsesame: http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.javascript/topics some good stuff in there

[03:20] draginx: Marak: I did clean install on npm and I did -g
[03:20] tbranyen: and you'll be on the right track
[03:20] Marak: draginx: you sure express installed right? worse case scenario, you should be able to clone and link
[03:20] Marak: i gotta go though, sorry :-(
[03:20] Marak: bbl
[03:21] draginx: later, and i mean.. "npm -g install express" dont know how else to do it :P

[03:44] tbranyen: so if you're doing just a hello world

[10:07] pyrotechnick1: have you looked at streaming the audio back to node?
[10:07] stagas: pyrotechnick1: I'm a noob to sc, a buddy has been using it for years and had the idea of making a client
[10:08] stagas: pyrotechnick1: dunno if it's possible. I want to figure out how to create synthdefs on the fly, that would be awesome. right now we are loading them up first in sc and then using them in node-sc
[10:08] pyrotechnick1: everything can be done programatically ;)
[10:08] pyrotechnick1: you cant find it in the docs?
[10:09] stagas: pyrotechnick1: eventually the idea is a browser interface for loading and controlling synthdefs

[10:10] pyrotechnick1: id really like to take another shot at my software reactable idea with node and html5 audio its kind of possible now

[10:14] Casperin has joined the channel
[10:14] stagas: pyrotechnick1: the one thing I want is to create and send synthdefs to sc without touching the sc interface. it is possible but it's difficult, it's not documented very well and it needs some reverse engineering

[10:16] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[10:16] pyrotechnick1: im real rusty with it all these days
[10:16] stagas: pyrotechnick1: or the easier way is to generate files in sc-lang and tell the server to load them from file
[10:16] pyrotechnick1: but im def interested
[10:17] JackeyChan: with php, you can give html class with <div class="<?php print php-give-me?>">php</div>, how to do with Jade template engine ?
[10:18] stagas: pyrotechnick1: sc-lang is quite similar to js so it would be great if everything was ported over to js land haha
[10:19] miloshadzic has joined the channel
[10:19] pyrotechnick1: yeah i was thinking that before
[10:20] stagas: pyrotechnick1: we use this port as a reference also, it's a python client for sc: http://trac2.assembla.com/pkaudio/wiki/SuperCollider
[10:21] stagas: pyrotechnick1: it would allow true sequencers/synths to be written in node which would be fantastic
[10:22] pyrotechnick1: ive seen some simple stuff being done in some custom "html5 audio" builds
[10:22] pyrotechnick1: maybe thats the future
[10:26] chjj: JackeyChan: if you want something similar to how php does that, youd probably be more comfortable with EJS

[10:59] guybrush: as long as it works with other browsers too?
[11:00] guybrush: i mean they build it into chrome?

[11:04] chjj: as long as they dont do something stupid

[11:04] q_no: I've got a php website which utilizes node.js for some features... and inside node.js I need to find out of a user is logged in or not ;)
[11:05] chjj: ok, node has access to the same filesystem right?
[11:05] neoesque has joined the channel
[11:05] q_no: yeah it does

[11:06] fairwinds has joined the channel
[11:06] chapel: Note: This prototype depends on proxy support which is currently only implemented in Firefox 4, so you'll need that to see everything working properly (changes to data objects reflected in the DOM). First-time rendering currently works in Chrome, Safari and IE9 (Opera doesn't work because it doesn't yet fully support ES5)
[11:07] guybrush: right
[11:07] chjj: q_no: its hard to say without understanding the structure of your app better
[11:07] guybrush: so whats the benefit of that over backbone?
[11:07] chapel: nothing, its experimental
[11:07] guybrush: kk
[11:07] chapel: http://code.google.com/p/mdv/
[11:08] chapel: they are looking at building it into chrome for extension and app builders
[11:08] chjj: q_no: if the browser would be sending the same cookie to the node server, it would be easy, i think most browsers disregard port when sending cookies
[11:08] guybrush: ah now i get it
[11:08] djazz has joined the channel
[11:08] q_no: chjj: I was hoping someone already made a tutorial/plugin for this issue
[11:08] q_no: I could pass the sessionID... but I need a way to safely revalidate it
[11:08] chjj: maybe you should just convert your entire app to node ;)
[11:08] chapel: I think the real benefit is that you write the template in html
[11:09] q_no: otherwhise anyone could pass any sessionID and overtake other users sessions
[11:09] chapel: and send it, and it handles that logic right there
[11:09] chjj: q_no: if you can get the session id, you could check the directory php creates session files in
[11:10] awenkhh has joined the channel
[11:10] chjj: the file names are the session id hashes, so you just have to look for that file
[11:10] q_no: yeah, but it wouldn't be safe from overtaking a session (I know it's hard to guess the IDs, but in theory passing any valid sessionID would result in an overtake)
[11:10] chjj: well youre doing something kind of hacky to begin with
[11:11] matwill has joined the channel
[11:11] chjj: there might be a better way but i just dont know how your app is structured
[11:12] q_no: I don't think the structure of my app plays a major role... cause the standard php-session handlers are always the same on any php website 
[11:12] chapel: can someone try to install json-schema via npm
[11:12] q_no: was hopeing someone already tackled this issue before ;)
[11:13] chjj: q_no: no, i mean, how is your app structured, what is the node server doing, what port is it on? etc.
[11:13] q_no: the php code creates the site, and node.js uses socket.io
[11:13] q_no: the website is: http://www.dashed.com ;) and infitie canvas where users can draw
[11:14] q_no: *infinite
[11:14] bergie has joined the channel
[11:18] chjj: i still think the simplest and dirtiest way would be to check the filesystem to verify the session data, however, instead of using the default php sessions, you could use some other php session system that talks to a db, and node could simply open up a connection with that db as well
[11:19] chjj: so you could have 2 session systems that kind of blend together through a common db

[11:44] q_no: I guess there is no cookie inside this function
[11:44] q_no: it's a permanent connection which only transfers the sent data
[11:44] q_no: so you need to pass the cookie values from the client on your own, using socket.io ;)
[11:45] q_no: please correct me, if I'm wrong
[11:45] gnagno: q_no, I thought when the client was opening the connection he was anyway sending the cookie somehow
[11:46] gnagno: I mean, when the client opens the socket.io connection isn't it a normal http request ?
[11:46] q_no: nope.. it can be a websocket, a flash-fallback or an xhr fallback
[11:46] gnagno: uhm.... you're right
[11:46] q_no: as far as I understand socket.io

[13:45] `3rdEden: yup
[13:45] mikegerwitz: Bananapwn: "should". Did you check? ;)
[13:46] Bananapwn: mikegerwitz: Well, at least if there's not a bug in node-oscar, as there are plenty of my contacts online ;)
[13:46] `3rdEden: gnagno still here
[13:47] mikegerwitz: Bananapwn: It's either i.contacts contains no enumerable items, or the write isn't working as expected. Add a console.log or use a debugger to see if res.write is actually being reached and see what i.contacts actually contains.
[13:47] gnagno: I made the sessionid work from my client.on('message'.... , but I get a different value than the one I get from a normal route in my app... is this normal ?

[13:48] drudge: chapel: the proxy has nothing to do with node. it's a regular http proxy that work requires all outbound http traffic go through
[13:49] gnagno: `3rdEden, should client.sessionId return the same value as req.sessionID from my normal express action ?
[13:49] chapel: then http.get shouldn't care as far as I know
[13:49] chapel: is it giving you trouble?
[13:50] drudge: chapel: i'm having trouble getting a post request through the proxy
[13:50] drudge: i changed the options so host = proxy host, port = proxy port, path = full original url
[13:50] `3rdEden: gnagno nope
[13:50] `3rdEden: Socket.IO generates it's own sessions ids
[13:51] chapel: drudge: I remember someone having a solution for that, but I dont remember what it was
[13:51] gnagno: `3rdEden, I am trying to persist the session information on redis, this way I cannot access the same session from socket.io and from express

[13:56] Bananapwn: mikegerwitz: console.log(i.name); prints out undefined, though the documentation states it should have this property: https://github.com/mscdex/node-oscar
[13:56] a|i: I don't really understand this, don't people make big real world websites with node+express? why is that it doesn't come with a standard directory structure, mvc framework etc? why does eveything about node have to be little quick-n-dirty blog-posted or gist-posted examples?
[13:56] mikegerwitz: mscdex: you there? (see Bananapwn)
[13:57] drudge: a|i: this stuff isn't mature at all
[13:57] `3rdEden: gnagno what you can do is store the sessionid of express in the HTML template and send it to Socket.IO when you connect
[13:57] a|i: drudge: so is currently node 0.6 really like rails 0.6?
[13:57] gnagno: `3rdEden, thank you :)
[13:58] jwcooper: a | i: not really a valid comparison.  node isn't a framework.  The frameworks you are looking for are like rails 0.6

[14:00] jwcooper: a|i: building a big MVC framework on top of express doesn't really make sense...it would be like building rails on sinatra
[14:01] a|i: jwcooper: the point is, if you want to make a big application in node, you'll need a lot of boilerplate code, which is not specific to your application at all. I call those common boilerplates the framework, I'm looking for that kind of stuff.

[14:05] a|i: jwcooper: what sort of boilerplate did you have to write yourself in this app? common things like user system?
[14:05] tmedema: At the moment, socket.io clients cannot be stored in redis right?
[14:06] a|i: c4milo: are you implementing ddd in node, or using a lib?

[14:06] `3rdEden: tmedema: nope clients can't be stored in redis as they are HTTP request objects ;)
[14:07] jwcooper: a|i: I wrote the user system, but have a lot of other node modules for validations, time zones, etc
[14:07] `3rdEden: but you can have you clients subscribe to redis channels, and pusblish messages to channel
[14:07] tmedema: `3rdEden: I do not know much about redis, I thought it could accept pretty much any object
[14:07] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[14:07] `3rdEden: It's a NoSQL database with some more fancy features :)
[14:07] a|i: jwcooper: why did you choose node for this app? for the realtime stuff?
[14:07] tmedema: `3rdEden: what about a BSON format of such client in a redis database?
[14:08] c4milo: a|i: no library you don't need libraries to do DDD, just keep your domain clean from specific frameworks (expressjs, mongoosejs, etc) 
[14:08] `3rdEden: tmedema sure you can add all kind of abstractions to the database, for example hostname / ip of your server & session id of the connected client
[14:08] c4milo: or you can tie your domain to mongoosejs if you want 
[14:08] jwcooper: a|i: yea, for the realtime components, socket.io was a nice plus as well.
[14:09] astropirate has joined the channel
[14:09] Druide_ has joined the channel
[14:09] c4milo: a|i: but if you got tired of mongoosejs in some point you will have to rewrite all your domain and validations, although it depends also in how you use mongoose 
[14:09] a|i: jwcooper: why didn't you consider writing the non-realtime parts in, eg, rails and the realtime parts in node? would it be more difficult that way? 
[14:10] tmedema: `3rdEden: so socket.io 0.7 is going to work on that?
[14:10] strmpnk has joined the channel
[14:10] a|i: c4milo: I prefer redis over mongo.

[14:11] jwcooper: a|i: I don't think it would be more difficult to split out the realtime components (except for maybe user management).  I just really like the node stack.
[14:11] a|i: tmedema: why would you want to persist your socket clients?
[14:11] willwhite has joined the channel
[14:12] a|i: jwcooper: I didn't have a problem with rail + node, untill recently, when I found out I need to share some models between the two. any suggestions?
[14:12] jwcooper: a|i: scaleability, to be able to use multiple node processes while using socket.io (reason I want to persist socket.io connections)
[14:12] tahu has joined the channel
[14:13] jwcooper: a|i: you're not a fan of mongo, but I've seen some folks tying together mongoose and mongomapper
[14:14] a|i: jwcooper: I already use redis pubsub, bringing mongo will make the stack a full zoo.
[14:15] jwcooper: a|i: yup, should be fairly simple to use one of the solid redis libraries to tie things together though
[14:15] c4milo: jwcooper: how many people is working in coobro? 
[14:15] jwcooper: a|i: this is from the express author...just released: a|i:

[14:16] jwcooper: c4milo: one developer, and one designer
[14:16] a|i: jwcooper: yes that can be done, but, the problem is that we have to maintain a copy of the same model in node and another one in rails.

[16:19] alcuadrado: and how can I hable errs from callbacks? That's what I quite don't get from node... suppose a receive an error from a Mongoose's save callback, and I just want to log an error, shall I log the object I received as is?

[18:01] tjholowaychuk: jspec is really old
[18:01] drudge: expresso!
[18:01] tjholowaychuk: it's only there for people who used it back in the day
[18:01] drudge: although i kinda like vows, expresso is definitely less fluff
[18:01] tjholowaychuk: they all suck
[18:01] tjholowaychuk: haha
[18:01] secoif: hah
[18:02] secoif: what do you use the most?
[18:02] tjholowaychuk: expresso, but it's not really great for integration tests
[18:02] tjholowaychuk: really depends what you are testing
[18:02] tjholowaychuk: but they are all lacking IMO
[18:03] secoif: vows --spec makes pretty output
[18:03] tjholowaychuk: i want to know if something passed or not haha couldnt care less about the output
[18:03] c4milo: tjholowaychuk: hey, I am using expresso for integration test and it's working great so far :P

[18:12] tauren: just curious, what editors are commonly used by node developers? emacs, vim, etc? or are there development IDEs that are recommended? 
[18:12] c4milo: I am using vim 
[18:13] mikegerwitz: tauren: I use vim for everything.
[18:13] secoif: tjholowaychuk: fine. Sold. I'll stick with expresso
[18:13] tauren: i'm trying to get a handle on what works well for an efficient dev environment. 
[18:13] secoif: it was my first thought but i wanted to know what all the fuss was with vows
[18:13] tauren: c4milo: mikegerwitz : thanks, i read somewhere else that many people use vim.
[18:14] mikegerwitz: tauren: Your most efficient environment will be whatever you're used to (unless you wish to spend the time learning) and what makes sense to you. Some people hate the command line. Others (like me) hate GUIs.
[18:14] secoif: tauren: I use eclipse sometimes, but mostly coda. Sometimes textmate. I'm on the fence
[18:14] secoif: oh and sometimes vim if I just need to change something quick
[18:15] mikegerwitz: tauren: Granted, I firmly believe that, once one conquers the learning curve, vim and command line is the most powerful environment you'll get. Even if you go for a GUI, command line's still a must imo.
[18:15] tauren: mikegerwitz: true, but what I'm used to is eclipse (for java development), but it seems so heavyweight for node dev.
[18:16] secoif: tauren: the only time I boot up eclipse is if I need to step through some code using the debugger
[18:16] mikegerwitz: tauren: What features do you look for in your env?

[18:17] tauren: color coding things would be nice
[18:18] tauren: i have aptana installed with eclipse, but code completion on JS files is crap
[18:18] mikegerwitz: tauren: while vim can do both, I'm not aware of a v8 debugging plugin for vim yet, unfortuantely. I use node-inspector, since I do most of my web development using Chromium. Code completion I rarely use, but there are numerous plugins.
[18:18] tauren: and i have no idea how to step through JS code in the debugger. maybe I need to find a howto.
[18:19] mikegerwitz: tauren: snipmate is useful for blocks of code. omnicomplete is built in
[18:19] tbranyen: snipmate is cool, too bad i never use it :-/
[18:19] tbranyen: i install a bunch of vim plugins that i never end up using

[19:29] draginx: node-orm looks nice though i wonder which works faster that or sequel O-o

[19:31] draginx: tauren: right i just needed an ORM for pgsql/mysql/etc.
[19:31] mscdex: node-orm and persistencejs
[19:32] drudge: for non orm stuff i use mysql-oil

[19:38] draginx: mscdex: which addon? Im assuming people who want to use mysql already have libmysqlclient no O_o
[19:38] drudge: the binding
[19:38] mscdex: draginx: i mean the binding
[19:38] draginx: oooo thats no good
[19:38] mscdex: but that brings up another point, they do have to have libmysqlclient installed

[19:58] doctorm: As someone who just spent two horrid days working with ffmpeg, transloadit seems like a great idea.

[21:10] mscdex: yeah
[21:10] baudehlo: *nod* I don't think it's the best place for it.

[21:13] tjholowaychuk: Charuru: not yet personally, I never use them
[21:14] baudehlo: doctorm: my favourite is just using plain callbacks and dealing with it :)
[21:14] tjholowaychuk: but I would accept a patch for sure
[21:14] Charuru: ok cool
[21:14] dandean has joined the channel
[21:14] doctorm: baudehlo: Even with filesystem stuff? Seems a bit kludgy
[21:14] mscdex: plain callbacks ftw!
[21:14] mscdex: :p
[21:14] baudehlo: doctorm: even with filesystem stuff.
[21:15] doctorm: I will give that a shot then
[21:15] baudehlo: it's not *that* bad.
[21:15] dve: Any suggestions as to where I can start debugging the error is posted ... 'node: ../src/node.cc:1212: ssize_t node::DecodeWrite(char*, size_t, v8::Handle<v8::Value>, node::encoding): Assertion `b[1] == 0' failed'
[21:15] baudehlo: but then I've been doing async programming for nearly 10 years now.
[21:15] mscdex: or write a little work queue thing
[21:15] doctorm: Well, I was looking at some of the async.js examples, and he talks about how all the callbacks mask the intent of the code.
[21:16] doctorm: The loaddir example at https://github.com/fjakobs/async.js kinda made me agree, but I'll give plain callbacks a try for now.
[21:17] xeodox has joined the channel
[21:17] doctorm: That example could probably be whipped into better shape using events anyway.
[21:18] mscdex: well
[21:18] mscdex: you could probably get by without doing that stat call
[21:18] mscdex: because i'm sure readfile does one internally
[21:19] baudehlo: plus it's a mess because it's all in anonymous functions.
[21:19] mscdex: yeah
[21:19] baudehlo: I do a lot of callbacks like function (err, thing) { if (err) { return handle error } self.do_something_with(thing) }
[21:19] dguttman has joined the channel
[21:20] baudehlo: and it makes it a lot cleaner
[21:20] doctorm: So, I'm checking to see if a file is a valid, using the default node stuff, should I just have it emit an event when it's decided whether the file is valid, and then setup a listener for that?
[21:20] doctorm: Or is there a cleaner / more nodeish way
[21:20] baudehlo: node way is to have a cb that takes (err, result)
[21:21] mscdex: or just (err) if you don't have to return anything
[21:21] doctorm: gotcha
[21:22] mscdex: so in your example, if (err) file_not_exists(); else file_exists();

[21:39] tjholowaychuk: which i dont care for anyway
[21:40] tim_smart: tjholowaychuk: Hmm ok. To allow cluster to create multiple apps per process, you will have to map the env variables to the port number
[21:40] doctorm: tj, I think they give people without a system for organizing their client side javascript something they can be familiar with
[21:40] dve: depends what your used to/comfortable writing.... as a c# dev seeing oo makes me feel happy

[21:41] techwraith: Is there any tricks to npm linking to a module that isn't in the registry
[21:41] a|i: tjholowaychuk: your client side code is either some spaghetti, or has a pattern, if that pattern is mvc, then it's very close to backbone.
[21:41] techwraith: we keep getting can't find dir 'blah'
[21:41] a|i: then if you like spaghetti and pasta, well you like spaghetti and pasta.

[22:36] doctorm: SubStack: I guess? I've got a big string and want to go through it line by line.
[22:36] doctorm: SubStack: Maybe I'm barking up the wrong tree
[22:37] SubStack: well if you've already slurped it all up into a string you can just bigString.split(/\n/).forEach(fn)
[22:37] SubStack: or /\r?\n/ if you don't want trailing (\r)s
[22:37] rytas has joined the channel
[22:38] doctorm: SubStack: Ok, that's what I was thinking, wasn't sure if there was some way to automatically detect line endings or something. Probably a dumb question.
[22:39] SubStack: you can create a readable stream too if you don't want to slurp up the whole file at once

[22:41] peerless: (Using ExpressJS/MongoDB) If I have a User model and I want to load the logged in user given session credentials, what is the proper way to do this? Have some global object that maps sessionID to user Object? I can't seem to just store the actual User object in the sessionStore..

[22:46] bronson: anyone running autotest on node?
[22:46] draginx: i guess i would just export.models.ModelName = blahblah in each models/file.js and then make the connection (db) then loop through exports.models? 
[22:46] dingomanatee: Has anyone written a script do split a SQL dump into distinct statements?
[22:46] tim_smart: draginx: You could just create a plugin for each 'controller'

[22:46] tim_smart: app.use(express.User()) or something
