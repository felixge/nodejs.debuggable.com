[00:06] jtsnow has joined the channel
[00:06] mikeal: i'm talking to guillermo about it a bit
[00:07] mikeal: once you upgrade a connection it needs to get removed from pooling
[00:07] beriberikix: isaacs: reviewing the .sh to see what you actually to there...
[00:07] creationix: I need help with the event loop
[00:07] creationix: libev and v8 scare me
[00:07] ryah_: creationix: ok
[00:07] ryah_: what's up?
[00:07] creationix: ryah_: for my node-sdl bindings
[00:08] creationix: SDL expects the app to make their own event loop, but I want to integrate it into node's event loop somehow
[00:08] creationix: so it should be easier than integrating with glib or something that has it's own
[00:08] creationix: but I'm still at a loss

[00:10] ryah_: creationix: have you seen https://github.com/deanm/plask
[00:10] isaacs: beriberikix: the general issue is that bin files are implemented using symlinks in npm right now
[00:10] isaacs: beriberikix: that has to be done with .bat files instead.  bootstrapping is comparatively easy
[00:10] Reginald_T_B has joined the channel
[00:10] beriberikix: isaacs: via mklink?
[00:11] creationix: ryah_: that looks cool. Though I specifically need SDL so it will also work for webOS apps
[00:11] isaacs: beriberikix: no, via fs.symlink
[00:11] isaacs: beriberikix: in node
[00:11] rchavik has joined the channel
[00:11] beriberikix: oh, got it
[00:11] isaacs: beriberikix: npm doesn't work on node 0.5 yet.
[00:11] creationix: ryah_: maybe I can peek at the event loop code there?
[00:11] isaacs: beriberikix: and doesn't work with the native windows port yet.
[00:11] ryah_: creationix: can you point me to the docs?
[00:11] isaacs: beriberikix: that'll come in a few months.

[00:14] rook2pawn has joined the channel
[00:14] Reginald_T_B: lol - okay. here goes:
[00:14] creationix: ryah_: ok, so assuming I have another thread working, how do I send events to v8 in the main thread?
[00:14] Nexxy: THE ANSWER IS NO!
[00:14] ryah_: creationix: actually.. i think we should look at plask
[00:14] ryah_: i think it has the answer
[00:15] Lightdork has joined the channel
[00:15] Reginald_T_B: So I was trying to do an install of wheat and ran into some dependency issues
[00:15] creationix: ryah_: the good news is that I'm learning a lot of C++ in the process :)
[00:15] Reginald_T_B: said i needed the creationix module - I can npm that ?
[00:15] creationix: Reginald_T_B: indeed
[00:16] Nexxy: you can install creationix via npm?
[00:16] bnoordhuis: creationix: you'll have to put the sdl event loop in another thread
[00:16] creationix: Reginald_T_B: you should just be able to npm install wheat and be done
[00:16] Nexxy: that's kinda like javascript transubstantiation
[00:16] bnoordhuis: creationix: you can communicate from that thread with the main thread through a pipe
[00:17] Reginald_T_B: that's what I thought. Which file in wheat serves as "index' ?
[00:17] bnoordhuis: creationix: simple solution is to put your events in a mutex-locked structure
[00:17] bnoordhuis: creationix: then write a byte to the pipe so the main thread wakes up
[00:17] Reginald_T_B: couldn't find an "index.js"
[00:17] bnoordhuis: creationix: then have the main thread pull off the events from said structure

[00:23] creationix: ryah_: not sure what I can use from that plask code, I don't have kqueue 
[00:24] rook2pawn: where the stdout data event kept misfiring for me
[00:24] creationix: bnoordhuis: what if there are events coming in faster than the main thread can consume them?
[00:24] Reginald_T_B_ has joined the channel
[00:24] creationix: bnoordhuis: will the event thread just block on the mutex?
[00:25] bnoordhuis: creationix: pushing and pulling things should be very fast, just work with pointers
[00:25] ryah_: creationix: but it's the same for epol
[00:25] k1ttty has joined the channel
[00:25] bnoordhuis: creationix: if events come in faster than the main thread can consume them... well, drop them
[00:25] ryah_: https://github.com/deanm/plask/blob/master/main.mm#L35-41
[00:25] creationix: bnoordhuis: but I don't want to drop them.  Many of my events are rpc calls
[00:25] creationix: not just mouse coordinate updates
[00:25] bnoordhuis: creationix: then make sure the main thread keeps up :)
[00:26] alnewkirk2 has joined the channel
[00:26] creationix: bnoordhuis: or block the event thread or queue the events
[00:26] bnoordhuis: creationix: yep
[00:26] bnoordhuis: creationix: if you're worried about contention
[00:27] bnoordhuis: creationix: have two lists referenced by pointer
[00:27] Kami_ has joined the channel

[01:05] creationix: bnoordhuis: I just need a way for the sdl polling thread to tell the main thread when there is data to grab
[01:05] creationix: like a custom event source in glib
[01:06] creationix: using a pipe seems overkill within the same process
[01:07] tonymilne has joined the channel
[01:07] creationix: ryah_: ^ do you understand?  I just need a way for another thread to trigger a function to be executed sometime in the main thread.  The multi-threaded equivalent to process.nextTick
[01:07] shanez has joined the channel
[01:08] ryah_: creationix: yeah - ev_async + some mutex locked queue is how i guess i'd do it
[01:08] ryah_: creationix: but in plask they do it all in one thread
[01:08] ryah_: they just let the GUI event loop drive node
[01:09] bnoordhuis: creationix: using a pipe to talk to yourself is an age-old unix trick
[01:09] creationix: ryah_: I see
[01:09] ryah_: doing it in one thread has a lot of benifits
[01:09] creationix: I just need a way to schedule a function to be executed in the main thread

[01:14] creationix: don't worry, I'm sure I can find the man page online
[01:15] samsonjs has joined the channel
[01:15] bnoordhuis: creationix: it's easy - create a mutex, then wrap all access to your fifo in a pthread_mutex_lock() and pthread_mutex_unlock()
[01:15] bnoordhuis: creationix: if you want to go spiffy, you can use a pthread_rwlock_t instead of a pthread_mutex_t
[01:15] bnoordhuis: creationix: but start out simple
[01:16] creationix: I don't have any data to sync between the threads
[01:16] creationix: just the fact that the main thread needs to go and get data
[01:16] bnoordhuis: oh, that's easy
[01:16] bnoordhuis: you don't need pthreads then
[01:16] bnoordhuis: only ev_async
[01:16] creationix: I just need a thread to execute the blocking SDL_WaitEvent() call
[01:17] creationix: and when it comes back, wake up my main thread
[01:17] creationix: so, I can av_async the waitevent call?
[01:18] creationix: while(true) { SDL_WaitEvent(); WAKE_UP_MAIN_THREAD; }
[01:18] bnoordhuis: creationix: yep

[01:28] ryah_: TooTallNate: we have a similar problem with window's run loop

[01:40] tjholowaychuk: creationix: yeah anything you want, void *

[01:50] bnoordhuis: creationix: wrap the handle in a struct that you malloc()
[01:50] jbwiv__: creationix, don't maintain as in abandoned, or just that others maintain?

[01:53] tjholowaychuk: gotta run
[01:53] AvianFlu has joined the channel
[01:53] creationix: so make a struct with a single member that's the persistent function handle?
[01:53] brianseeders has joined the channel
[01:54] creationix: typedef callback { Persistent<Function> fn } ?
[01:54] bnoordhuis: creationix: make that -> typedef struct { Persistent<Function> fn; } callback_t;
[01:54] bnoordhuis: creationix: you could new() the handle directly
[01:55] bnoordhuis: creationix: but this way you're covered if you want to add more properties in the future
[01:55] meso has joined the channel
[01:55] infynyxx has joined the channel
[01:55] creationix: what's callback_t, my new custom type?
[01:55] bnoordhuis: yep
[01:55] TooTallNate: bnoordhuis: but is a struct required in this case? Why wouldn't just passing the Persistent work?
[01:56] creationix: and to malloc it "callback_t *callback = (callback_t*) malloc(sizeof(callback_t));" ?
[01:56] infynyxx has left the channel
[01:56] bnoordhuis: creationix: yep
[01:56] TooTallNate: creationix: yep.
[01:56] creationix: well, I guess the advantage of the struct is that I can add more data later if wanted
[01:57] bnoordhuis: TooTallNate: req->data = (void*) handle is bad style
[01:57] bnoordhuis: TooTallNate: even if it works now because a handle is nothing but a wrapper around a pointer atm
[01:57] bnoordhuis: but that can break if the v8 api changes
[01:58] creationix: ok, now how do I put args[0] into the struct I just malloc'ed
[01:58] bnoordhuis: creationix: what is args[0]?
[01:58] TooTallNate: bnoordhuis: oh ok. I was just assuming that it was a pointer anyways, my bad
[01:58] creationix: const Arguments& args
[01:58] zivester has joined the channel
[01:58] creationix: and that's v8::Arguments
[01:58] TooTallNate: creationix: what data type?
[01:58] bnoordhuis: creationix: right, you wrap it in a Persistent<> and put it in your struct
[01:59] creationix: v8::Function
[01:59] TooTallNate: Persistent<Function> callback = Persistent::New(args[0]->ToFunction())
[01:59] creationix: callback.fn = Persistent<Function>::New(Handle<Function>::Cast(args[0])) ?
[01:59] allanca has joined the channel
[02:00] creationix: or that, if there is a ToFunction(), it didn't seem to work the last time I tried
[02:00] TooTallNate: Ya I think Cast works too
[02:00] allanca has left the channel
[02:00] TooTallNate: creationix: oh you're right, no ToFunction()
[02:01] TooTallNate: creationix: ok, ya I use Cast in my code
[02:01] bnoordhuis: yep, Cast is what you need
[02:01] creationix: getting closer!
[02:01] jslatts has joined the channel
[02:02] creationix: is "ev_ref(EV_DEFAULT_UC);" needed?
[02:02] allanca has joined the channel
[02:02] creationix: saw it in tj's code
[02:02] bnoordhuis: creationix: it stops the event loop from, err.. stopping
[02:02] TooTallNate: creationix: that prevents node from exiting the event loop

[02:34] Lorentz: jbwiv__: There's no standard one as part of nodejs, if that's what you're asking. There are many to choose from.
[02:34] jasong_at_apache: express isn't a full stack like say django

[03:13] chjj: what were you trying to untar?

[03:24] mscdex: keyvan: oh and fwiw that patch made it into node 0.5.1 today just in time ;-)

[03:25] clarkfischer: I understand that a int64 is about twice as long as an int32, and I know that I can write to the buffer directly using buffer[index], but I don't know anything about endian/network ordering or encoding or any of that
[03:26] chjj: clarkfischer: well it would be about 8 lines of code, do you want it big or little endian?
[03:26] clarkfischer: Big endian, I need to write a Uint64 at offset 0, then two Uint32s at 1 and 2
[03:27] chjj: k, so it would be like...
[03:27] caiges_ has joined the channel
[03:27] chjj: buff[i++] = (unit64 >> 56) & 0xFF; buff[i++] = (unit64 >> 48) & 0xFF; etc...
[03:27] chjj: keep decreasing the right shifts
[03:27] chjj: by 8 bits
[03:28] clarkfischer: until 0?
[03:28] chjj: and i is incremented each time
[03:28] chjj: yeah
[03:28] chjj: just to num & 0xFF
[03:28] hermanjunge has joined the channel

[03:29] chjj: its only a couple lines though

[03:30] clarkfischer: Where does the number 56 come from?
[03:30] hermanjunge has joined the channel
[03:30] chjj: 64 - 56 = 8, the "first" byte on the left
[03:30] clarkfischer: ah
[03:31] clarkfischer: and then to write subsequent integers to this buffer
[03:31] fraserkillip has joined the channel
[03:31] clarkfischer: can I just use Buffer.prototype.writeUInt32?
[03:31] mandric has joined the channel
[03:31] chjj: that would write a uint 32, yeah
[03:33] Raisdead has joined the channel
[03:33] clarkfischer: so big endian just means you write to the left-hand side of a buffer?
[03:34] chjj: little endian would start with the right-most byte on the int youre writing, so `int & 0xff`
[03:35] clarkfischer: god, bitwise stuff is complex.

[05:19] rhdoenges: coffeescript is a pain to develop with.
[05:19] rhdoenges: it's all the convenience of a compiled language with the speed of an interpreted one
[05:19] blueadept: well if more and more teams are choosing coffee then i dont want to be the oddman out having to learn it once it starts to get going and becomes more popular
[05:19] rhdoenges: I'm being really harsh.
[05:20] rhdoenges: coffee's easy to learn, don't worry about it.

[13:59] lukegalea: baudehlo: they are, but they aren't using jsdom with it, just raw node-canvas. But a lot of the graphing plugins try and modify the DOM as well, which is where the problem comes in.
[13:59] lukegalea: It's nice and simple for line and bar graphs but pie charts are being a pain. I'd just start hacking the plugins if I didn't clearly see pie charts on learnboost.com, so I know they've got it figured out ;)
[14:00] brianc has joined the channel
[14:00] baudehlo: I guess the trick is to find a pie chart library that doesn't need the dom :)

[14:05] baudehlo: unless you want to right-click and download them
[14:05] jasong_at_apache: maybe baaaaaaack in the day when ppl were writing perl servers and all you had was mosaic..
[14:05] lukegalea: this is primarily a mobile app, so I can't rely on the device to do any heavy work. Pie charts are simple enough that I could break my rule here, but much of the other charts are way too much for a phone to render.
[14:05] kmiyashiro: download an image?
[14:06] lukegalea: ya, that's how it works now.
[14:06] lukegalea: node-canvas renders a png
[14:06] lukegalea: for the exact size of the mobile device.
[14:06] jasong_at_apache: for pie charts d3 will work!!
[14:06] baudehlo: yeah to be fair if I try and render my mail server graphs on my phone it takes forever and often just fails.

[18:21] topaxi has joined the channel

[18:22] systemfault: catphive1: You're right that you don't need to specify the type :)
[18:22] catphive1: which needs a way to specify how to pop arguments off the stack
[18:22] context: and printf does a damn good job at that
[18:22] mjr_: Tobbe: in that exmaple, I forgot to actually do something in the callback.  Just try taking that example, and reformatting it, then add some logging and stuff.
[18:22] catphive1: printf is pretty dangerous in c
[18:22] systemfault: There's only a few safe things in C :P

[18:24] systemfault: Hmm
[18:24] context: :/ ... printf makes sense when you dont replace it with someting similar...
[18:25] systemfault: Does node.js has (n)curses bindings?
[18:25] systemfault: That could be answer.
[18:25] systemfault: Ahhh, you just need printf-style formatting.
[18:25] context: no. that sounds like a lot of work
[18:26] context: systemfault: yeah correct
[18:26] systemfault: You could do it yourself, won't be more than a loop and a few .replace, right?
[18:26] context: printf is pretty complex if you look at all the options it has

[18:27] systemfault: If you need all the options.. yeah :/
[18:27] beriberikix: brainc: require.paths.unshift('C:\\node\\node_modules') works, but obviously doesn't persist. Any ideas?

[18:48] isaacs: chrisdickinson: to the land of Bad Ideas That Seemed Good At The Time
[18:48] chrisdickinson: isaacs: is there going to be any equivalent support for getting / setting paths anywhere?
[18:48] isaacs: chrisdickinson: the NODE_PATH environment var will still be read at startup, but it'll be immutable.

[18:50] chrisdickinson: isaacs: true, but it does pretty much shut the door on any "pure node" virtual environments (a la python's virtualenv.)
[18:50] ryah: isaacs: cool
[18:50] isaacs: chrisdickinson: well, localized modules are already possible with node_modules folders.

[18:52] chrisdickinson: one question, re the nesting of modules -- if your root level installs module X alongside modules A, B, and C, each of which require module X, do they each get their own copy of X, or do they lean on the root-level X?
[18:53] brainproxy: chrisdickinson: that's explained in the npm docs https://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/doc/folders.md
[18:53] justicefries has joined the channel
[18:53] brainproxy: see the "cycles, conflicts..." section toward the bottom
[18:53] isaacs: chrisdickinson: they'll get the root one, unless there's another X installed inside A, B, or C
[18:53] isaacs: chrisdickinson: in which case, they'll get that one
[18:54] mikelietz: I'm running into a problem with modules that can't be found.
[18:54] chrisdickinson: isaacs: cool. so even if they list package X as a requirement in their package.json, if the root X satisfies that requirement, it'll be used.
[18:54] mikelietz: line 25 here: https://gist.github.com/4ac67d446970bcbe4f40
[18:54] isaacs: chrisdickinson: yeah, that's fairly new-ish.
[18:54] isaacs: chrisdickinson: ie, that changed slightly in the yet-to-be-release 1.0.16
[18:55] isaacs: chrisdickinson: in that it'll *always* favor the parent copy, even if there's a newer one.

[19:12] mikelietz: ohhh. Got it.
[19:12] mikelietz: thanks!
[19:12] isaacs: mikelietz: and it's several hundred lines longer than i like those sorts of things to be :)
[19:12] mikelietz: I think the nerdie people are talking about using something simpler, too.
[19:12] isaacs: mikelietz: but i'm fully willing to accept that i'm a luddite in that area.

[19:14] sveisvei has joined the channel
[19:14] context: toto1: im wondering why you'd need it, unless your writing a real-time game?
[19:15] ixti has joined the channel
[19:15] toto1: context, yes real time game, only for chess, with chess lag is big problem
[19:15] context: or.. doing something requiring real time, video/audio , which even then flash uses tcp for video and audio
[19:15] isaacs: beriberikix: it should still work the same as unix, though, right?  $HOME/.node_modules, prefix/lib/node etc.
[19:15] context: toto1: just use a websocket.
[19:16] toto1: context, websocket is to connect web browser to sever, not to anothr bweb browser??
[19:16] context: its chess. not doom 4. you dont need sub 200ms response times (which websockets will still give you)
[19:16] context: toto1: correct ?
[19:16] micheil: hmm?
[19:16] japj: isaacs: do you know an npm package that includes (>1 deep) dependencies? (for testing ryppi)
[19:16] context: you are NOT going to connect a browser to another browser. period.
[19:16] micheil: context: websockets are necessarily about speed but abot data
[19:16] isaacs: japj: express
[19:16] toto1: context, more important for chess because lag must be equal for both players
[19:17] isaacs: japj: it depends on connect, which depends on mime and qs
[19:17] Ramosa: best OS for node.js? hit me
[19:17] beriberikix: isaacs: require.paths is just ../lib/node if I run node.exe, and undefined if I add it to the PATH

[19:17] isaacs: japj: but "tap" is another good one.
[19:17] micheil: context: if you were to use long-polling / short-polling for a chess game, you'd be sending a lot more data than what you would if you used websockets
[19:17] isaacs: japj: lots of deps there.
[19:17] micheil: (like, most of the data usage would be in the headers and timed out connections)
[19:17] brianmario has joined the channel
[19:18] micheil: morning isaacs 
[19:18] japj: isaacs: holy crap, tap has a lot of depencies
[19:18] isaacs: morning :)
[19:18] context: micheil: think you man toto1 
[19:18] isaacs: japj: yeah, every file is its own standalone util
[19:18] context: toto1: its chess. lag doesn't matter.
[19:18] isaacs: context: !!!
[19:18] micheil: isaacs: hey, what's that thing with global variables and leaking variables between modules?
[19:18] context: isaacs: ?
[19:18] isaacs: context: chess without a timer is like a car without an engine.
[19:19] context: oh. timer !
[19:19] toto1: context, what in chess many players play 1 minute game, 50ms player against 200ms player is not fair conditions
[19:19] micheil: toto1: I agree with context on the fact that lag in chess does not matter, however, I'd still recommend you use websockets for bandwidth efficiency
[19:19] isaacs: micheil: all modules have the same global context.  don't pollute it.  also, don't rely on polluting it, because if you run wiht NODE_MODULE_CONTEXTS=1 in the env, then they don't.
[19:19] AvianFlu:  I don't think I've ever once played chess with a clock
[19:19] AvianFlu: I'm aware of them, obviously
[19:20] isaacs: no.  lag in chess matters a lot.
[19:20] isaacs: if you have a timer
[19:20] AvianFlu: I just don't think I've ever played chess that seriously
[19:20] Soapy_Illusions: can anyone help with an http.request() where it's callback is never reached neither is it's on 'error' , as if the request hangs up 
[19:20] micheil: isaacs: eg, `foo = require('blah'); baz = require('baz');`
[19:20] isaacs: micheil: yes, that will pollute the global.
[19:20] micheil: then from within baz you can access foo
[19:20] isaacs: yeah
[19:20] context: toto1: so have the client send a timestamp when it submits, and if its within xxx ms or something accept it.
[19:20] toto1: micheil: but websockets are only between web browser and server? not between two web browser???
[19:20] isaacs: micheil: unless you run with module contexts
[19:20] context: toto1: you're going to have a difference no matter wyat
[19:20] micheil: toto1: that is correct, websockets are server <-> browser
[19:21] jetienne has joined the channel
[19:21] context: toto1: YOU CANNOT CONNECT A BROWSER TO A BROWSER. i said this already
[19:21] micheil: isaacs: okay, this came up recently in a conversation about sharing require's and configuration and stuff
[19:21] toto1: i need a communication between two web browser, how?
[19:21] context: toto1: you HAVE to have a server in the middle. 
[19:21] context: toto1: you also HAVE to have a server to ensure no one cheats.
[19:21] micheil: (particularly in some node.js stuff we're doing at pusher)
[19:21] clyfe: toto1> you cannot do browser to browser directly
[19:21] toto1: when will this be possible? with flash, with java? something is possible no?
[19:22] micheil: toto1: in a game situation, you should never trust the client
[19:22] tuhoojabotti: https://github.com/tuhoojabotti/Chromerly-URL-shortener Translations are welcome! :D
[19:22] context: NEVER !
[19:22] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[19:22] clyfe: toto1> only with native browser extensions
[19:22] jetienne: context: you can, with fflash
[19:22] micheil: toto1: that can also be extended to "never trust the client. STOP"
[19:22] mehtryx: question - I've created a executable as per: https://gist.github.com/1085350  to run my ../lib/somefile.js  if I add the /bin directory of this project to my $PATH variable I can launch that program, but without it doesnt work.  which I can understand…except….why when I install say… coffee-script, is coffee and cake binaries accessible without a path to their bin folder ( local not global) ? I assume I'm missing an option or step?
[19:22] context: jetienne: prove it 
[19:22] jetienne: context: read the doc
[19:23] micheil: toto1: there is a peer-to-peer communication layer coming, but it has to do a bunch of really complicated STUN and TURN traversal
[19:23] toto1: i dont trust the client, both players send server the results, if they are same they are accepted, if not game is not credited, i think this could be correct 
[19:23] clyfe: toto1> you need a central server anyways: http://www.bluesnews.com/abrash/chap70.shtml
[19:23] context: jetienne: vague. 
[19:23] benjaminRRR has joined the channel
[19:23] micheil: so it's much easier to not use client-to-client and just use client-to-server-to-client
[19:23] toto1: both players send udp to each other and to server two during game
[19:23] nerdfiles has joined the channel
[19:23] jetienne: context: no, flash got doc, it is able to do it for years
[19:23] micheil: and even with TURN / STUN you need that central server to work
[19:23] context: jetienne: according to ActionScript docs, flash.net.ServerSocket only exists in AIR
[19:23] context: jetienne: so im still correct.
[19:23] tobmaster has joined the channel
[19:24] jetienne: context: unfortunatly no
[19:24] context: toto1: browser does not have udp. browser does not have server socket. with or without flash unless jetienne can prove the docs im reading wrong
[19:24] micheil: jetienne: you may want to read the pusher blog over the next few days, we're releasing some JS updates that you may want to read about
[19:24] toto1: when game is finished, if udp sent are correct game is credited, if something went wrong game is aborted
[19:24] micheil: context: correction: browsers don't currently have UDP, they will soon.
[19:25] clyfe: toto1> wouldn't that make n*n connection +1*n (server) = a lot of trafic VS 1*n when each only talks with server ?
[19:25] micheil: toto1: also, in a chess game, you want data reliability
[19:25] beriberikix: isaacs: require.paths is also barfing at the colon, NODE_PATH = C:\node\node_modules results in require.paths -> [ 'C', '\\node\\node_modules', 'C:\\Users\\lib\\node' ]
[19:25] context: toto1: udp still has latency... so that hardly fixes your 50ms vs 200ms connections...
[19:25] isaacs: micheil: the best way there is to either use npm for config, or have a config.js module
[19:25] jetienne: context: relax, just considere the possibility exist
[19:25] isaacs: beriberikix: that's awesome.
[19:25] micheil: toto1: you will also need a server to do user assignments, so who plays who
[19:25] isaacs: beriberikix: how do people set the PATH environs and stuff in Windows?
[19:25] isaacs: piscisaureus: ?
[19:26] context: jetienne: irc puts me in rage mode sometimes :/ its not good for my health. and i prefer to not assume. i like docs that prove what i say
[19:26] toto1: context, main problem is latency is shared and equal, that is the case because time is same in both way
[19:26] micheil: isaacs: okay, and with the require system, the first require will be fresh, then everything shared between the mutliple requires, right?
[19:26] piscisaureus: isaacs: !
[19:26] `3rdEden: context yes you can connect a browser to a browser
[19:26] beriberikix: isaacs: I just did PATH c:\node and it works fine. But I think its how node.exe is parsing it
[19:26] isaacs: piscisaureus: how do windows users set the PATH environs and stuff?  Our NODE_PATH is getting borked by the : in C:\

[19:27] toto1: yes server, propse opponents, give ip of opponent so they can send them moves, server register game after
[19:27] micheil: context: like I said before, browser to browser is coming.
[19:27] isaacs: beriberikix: we do a very naive process.env.NODE_PATH.split(":")
[19:27] micheil: WEBRTC, and a few other things are enabling it
[19:27] isaacs: beriberikix: so it's probably just broken.
[19:27] piscisaureus: isaacs: separate by ; not :

[19:27] isaacs: piscisaureus: really?  that's how %PATH% etc is set?
[19:27] toto1: micheil i must follow what to know when it will be possible?
[19:27] jetienne: context: doc = documentation
[19:27] isaacs: piscisaureus: it's separated by ;?
[19:28] micheil: toto1: I'm not sure, maybe the w3c public mailing list?
[19:28] jetienne: context: are you seriously ignoring what "doc" mean ?
[19:28] micheil: or the w3c comms mailing list?
[19:28] piscisaureus: isaacs: yes, semicolon is the separator
[19:28] isaacs: ok.  that's a bug, then
[19:28] context: jetienne: no im ignoring someone that says 'read the doc' and the 'doc' i just read said its only in air.

[19:31] context: battery*

[19:35] isaacs: japj: most are named "package", but that's relatively recent.
[19:36] isaacs: japj: it can be anything.
[19:36] isaacs: japj: but it's always 1 folder.

[19:36] ajsie: i did npm install . -g for a package .. and it's deps were installed but when I run the cli tool it says

[19:36] ajsie: Error: Cannot find module '../deps/async'
[19:36] context: jetienne: appologize but after wasting 10 minutes googling, im gonna stick with what i said.
[19:37] japj: isaacs: yeah, but I'm extracting the tar from python so no strip-components=1 I think
[19:37] isaacs: ajsie: what's ../deps/async?  that's not npm's job.  maybe you need to put something else there?
[19:37] isaacs: beriberikix: it's going away.
[19:37] jetienne: context: no need to apologize, no hard feeling
[19:37] isaacs: beriberikix: actually, that issue pretty much sums it up :)
[19:38] context: jetienne: but for mine and everyone elses sake, can you not say things that you cannot validate in anyway at all
[19:38] ajsie: isaacs: hm its not my lib .. i just trying to use it with npm link .. the weird thing is that it works when i install it with "npm install kanso -g"
[19:38] jetienne: context: relax, you have the right to disagree with me
[19:38] beriberikix: isaacs: Ah, but node_paths is still there :p Wondered how that would work. Should I file a bug for the windows not handling :?
[19:39] isaacs: beriberikix: sure.  it should be delimited by ";", rather than ":"

[19:49] kmiyashiro: ACTION just understood the function
[19:49] ajsie: isaacs: oh i get it now .. because its a symlink .. so a relative path is starting from /usr/local/bin/kanso and not the package's location

[19:49] kmiyashiro: an API I'm calling requires ,

[22:19] isaacs: felixge: no, package.json is nice.
[22:19] tjholowaychuk: quackquack: app.settings.env
[22:19] felixge: isaacs: then we should get rid of index.js ?
[22:19] isaacs: felixge: otherwise npm has to do more work to make it work, and just unpacking modules won't be as trivial.
[22:20] felixge: isaacs: right now they can kinda do the same 
[22:20] isaacs: felixge: i'd be ok with that, but a lot of existing programs depend on it.
[22:20] felixge: isaacs: that's your problem! :)
[22:20] felixge: just kidding
[22:20] isaacs: felixge: hehe
[22:20] tjholowaychuk: deprecate it
[22:20] tjholowaychuk: haha
[22:20] tjholowaychuk: index.js at root makes more sense
[22:20] isaacs: felixge: i *really* don't like npm to be required.  it should be used becuase it's useful.
[22:20] felixge: I actually like index.js more than package.json
[22:20] felixge: so I'll be silent if this turns against me
[22:20] felixge: : )
[22:20] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: the issue there is that you end up wiht a dozen files named "index.js"
[22:20] isaacs: that kinda sucks for debugging
[22:21] isaacs: and the command-t extension in vim.
[22:21] quackquack: tjholowaychuk: thanks!
[22:21] tjholowaychuk: meh kinda depends on the editor i guess
[22:21] felixge: isaacs: I ignore my node_modules folder
[22:21] tjholowaychuk: but i have tons of files named the same anyway
[22:21] mikeal: ok, i feel really good about this branch now
[22:21] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: ui'm talking about hte node built in debugger.
[22:21] felixge: If I find myself editing the local node_modules folder it's a reminder I should be using npm link
[22:21] tjholowaychuk: ah
[22:21] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: it shows you the files in use, and if they're all "index.js" it's useless.
[22:21] isaacs: felixge: good practice :)

[22:22] felixge: :)
[22:22] isaacs: we should change the module system slowly.  i think it's in sort of a good place now.
[22:22] felixge: yeah, I'm happy with it for most parts
[22:22] isaacs: ACTION is the stick in the mud.

[22:23] mikeal: how do i build the docs?
[22:23] tjholowaychuk: everything in js is a hack
[22:23] felixge: my main problem was injecting stuff into the modules I require for unit testing, but I solved that with sandboxed module, and I can make it a lot simpler for 0.5

[22:25] ckknight_: JS does have the problem of having a minimum level of hackiness for nearly anything, though.
[22:26] tjholowaychuk: yeah

[22:57] ryah: tjholowaychuk: we're prob landing mikeal's patch after v0.5.2 so you might want to wait for that
[22:57] tjholowaychuk: will do
[22:57] mikeal: i don't know if i like that
[22:57] theCole has joined the channel
[22:58] mikeal: because as it stands everything is built on OutgoingMessage and IncomingMessage
[22:58] mikeal: whenever you're writing code against ClientRequest/Response and ServerRequest/Response you need to refer to them over and over agian
[22:58] mikeal: it's simpler being in the same file
[22:59] mikeal: you even to to refer to the Server objects when you're doing Client work to figure out why something might be in Outoing/Incoming Message when you want to patch it
[22:59] Murvin: mikeal:  is it recommend to do clientRequest.abort()  when on("error"), or let the http.js to handle it?
[22:59] mikeal: they are entangled with each other to separate them mentally so i don't see why they should be separate files
[22:59] tjholowaychuk: i guess. i didn't really mean just http.js, any that are too large and would make sense to organize
[22:59] mikeal: Murvin: it's unnecessary
[22:59] mikeal: others might lend themselves to it better
[22:59] mikeal: but http.js is very interdependent 
[23:00] mikeal: more than you would think
[23:00] kmurph79 has joined the channel
[23:00] mikeal: honestly tho, that file will get hundreds of lines smaller
[23:00] mikeal: when we remove http.cat and http.Client
[23:00] tjholowaychuk: all i know is when I search for end() etc in any file I get like 5 or more hits
[23:00] Murvin: mikeal: ok.   seems that your http.js solve the socket problem that borther me for so long.
[23:00] mikeal: the whole bottom of the file is just legacy interface
[23:01] bnoordhuis: mikeal tjholowaychuk: as long as it's < ~2000 lines i don't see a need to break it up
[23:01] mikeal: I think there is only one end() method in all of http.js
[23:01] mikeal: it's on OutgoingMessage
[23:01] Murvin: mikeal:    By the way, is there a reason why not exporting socket's timeout ?   :)
[23:01] mikeal: what do you mean?
[23:03] Murvin: the socket timeout is default to 2 minutes.   but, if I want to change the timeout, then the only way is to change it in the http.js and make it again..  
[23:03] Murvin: just think that it would be nice if developer can set the timeout.
[23:03] mikeal: yeah, tjholowaychuk: there is only one end() method in http.js
[23:03] tjholowaychuk: mikeal must be thinking of some other method / file :s haha not sure off hand
[23:04] tjholowaychuk: to me they are too large, but i guess that's just opinion
[23:04] mikeal: Murvin: http.get().setTimeout()
[23:04] mikeal: tjholowaychuk: there are probably more in net and fs
[23:04] Murvin: what about http.request().setTimeout(), same?
[23:05] Murvin: so, it will overwrite the socket one?

[23:11] Murvin: mikeal:  ok.   what is the arguments?   a function?  what if I want to set the timeout be only 30 secons... instead of 2 minutes..
[23:11] mikeal: the arguments are exactly the same as socket.setTimeout
[23:11] mikeal: it literally calls socket.setTimeout.apply(socket, arguments)
[23:12] mikeal: it just waits to do that until a) a socket is assigned for the request and b) it has had a "connect" event

[23:37] bnoordhuis: Murvin: it's a local error, originating from your machine
[23:37] stagas_ has joined the channel
[23:38] bnoordhuis: Murvin: if you get this when making requests to another server, you're trying to bind the client connection to an ip address you don't have
[23:39] Murvin: mikeal: so far, i have run about 500,000 request  by using ab.  except for that EADDR and occasionally socket hang up problem, i don't see the same kind of socket leak as before.   and after the a while, the # of sockets (lsof) will drop down (but not 0).   it is way better than before, in which the number will stay.
[23:40] mikeal: if you stop making requests node should exit

[23:41] Murvin: bnoordhuis:  Hmm..   yes. my node use  http.request to connect another server by IP address.  I run the test on the same IP address.  most of the time, it success.  but after running a while, the EADDR error will occur.  when it happen, it will happen in mass (subsequence calls), instead of just one or two.

[23:42] bnoordhuis: Murvin: you've probably exhausted the bind space when that happens

[23:43] bnoordhuis: Murvin: since you bind to a single address, the only differentiator is the port number and that's quite limited
[23:43] Murvin: hmmm bind space.. how to increase it?
[23:43] Murvin: and I actually connect to one IP address with one port for all requests.

[23:43] Murvin: is it caused by the bind space at my side?

[23:48] bnoordhuis: Murvin: google for TIME_WAIT
[23:49] Murvin: ok
[23:49] Murvin: hahaha.. ok.. i m actually use up 44000 TCP  while running the test.. hmmm
[23:50] mikeal: if you make the requests faster you'll use the same connection because of keep-alive
[23:50] mikeal: queue them all up at once
[23:52] Murvin: by the way, bnoordhuis, mikeal, I think the socket leak problem is not there in the http.js fix.  Thanks.  It really saves my project. :)  and a prove to those who suspect my decision using node. :D
[23:52] Murvin: really thank you.
[23:53] bnoordhuis: no need to thank me, it's all mikael's work
[23:54] justinw312 has joined the channel
[23:54] Murvin: still. u help a lot too. hehehe anyway.    let me dig into the port problem.      oh.. socket hang up still happen but only occassionally.  i think it is just a timeout or broken connection..
[23:55] justinw312: Hey, I was wondering if there's a static web server module for node that has pulled ahead of the pack in terms of project activity and adoption?
[23:55] justinw312: I mean, is one significantly ahead in popularity. 
[23:55] nym: express
[23:55] justinw312: You don't think it's overkill for only serving static files?
[23:55] nym: yes, it's probably overkill
[23:55] Murvin: mikeal: by the way, it seems the new http.js is faster in performance too.    
[23:55] tjholowaychuk: justinw312: if you just want to serve statics use nginx or connect's static() middleware
[23:56] nym: but if you want something that isn't overkill, wouldn't you just step up nginx?
[23:56] mikeal: by default, most definitely
[23:56] mikeal: because it defaults to keep-alive
[23:56] tjholowaychuk: justinw312: connect(connect.static(path)).listen(80) done
[23:56] mikeal: so if you keep the socket pool full (which will happen under concurrent load) you don't have to do a new TCP handshake for every request
[23:56] Murvin: mikeal:  oh.  yeah.  the speed is consistent too.
[23:57] justinw312: Well, express might not be a bad idea. Right now, I plan to only require static files -- but that could always change.

[23:58] tjholowaychuk: justinw312: yeah, if you're not using routes express doesn't add any overhead that connect doesn't already have so that part doesn't matter
[23:59] kartmetal: so... npm and mingw.. got the code from git, did a make install with no error.. any idea where npm was installed? it's not in my PATH.
