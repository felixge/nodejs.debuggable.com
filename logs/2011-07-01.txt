[00:00] maushu: Gigawatt, you can use the variable from the parent scope. Research "javascript closures".
[00:01] Gigawatt: v8: function A(message,callback){message += "ttt"; callback(); } var M = "ABC"; A(M,function(){console.log(M);})
[00:01] v8bot: Gigawatt: "ABC"
[00:01] Gigawatt: I can see that it's passed by value
[00:03] JoshC1 has joined the channel
[00:05] Gigawatt: ok got another issue, whats the best way to loop a list of files async and call a callback only when the list is complete
[00:05] jerrysv: gigawatt: smtp mailer? or smtp server?
[00:06] Gigawatt: mailer
[00:06] tjholowaychuk: a real one? or sendmail?
[00:06] tjholowaychuk: or using node apis?
[00:06] Gigawatt: i real one, that uses sockets to connect to a host and transport the email
[00:07] tjholowaychuk: whoop
[00:07] glimpsenirvana has joined the channel
[00:07] Gigawatt: so yea, i need to read data from a list of files and call the callback only when the all the files have been read
[00:08] Gigawatt: but needs to be async
[00:09] Gigawatt: https://gist.github.com/1057595
[00:10] tjholowaychuk: you just need to iterate and have
[00:10] tjholowaychuk: var pending = attachments.length;
[00:10] tjholowaychuk: --pending || callback()
[00:10] tjholowaychuk: with error handling etc
[00:10] skript_ has joined the channel
[00:11] TooTallNate: simple counters ftw!
[00:11] Gigawatt: hmm, nice
[00:11] Gigawatt: so after each iteration check the length's
[00:11] Gigawatt: if they equal then call the callback and break
[00:11] tjholowaychuk: in each callback do that
[00:12] skript_ has joined the channel
[00:12] tjholowaychuk: then when they are all done
[00:12] tjholowaychuk: it will invoke the main callback

[00:24] t|f: npm is considered best practice for dependency management right, not using git submodules? 
[00:25] tjholowaychuk: correcto
[00:25] isaacs: t|f: you can use git submodules if you prefer that
[00:25] isaacs: t|f: i use git submodules for npm
[00:25] mikey_p: unless you have to patch all your submodules, or are doing development on the submodules, npm is probably easier
[00:26] level09: is it easy to configure git submodules
[00:26] isaacs: i don't use submodules in any *other* packages, just in npm itself.
[00:26] isaacs: also, there's an "npm submodule" command in 1.0.16
[00:27] t|f: :) Thanks :) Actually I really prefer npm right now. Used submodules before with not too much trouble, but I can't get jsdav to work anymore and it seems related to either the async.js submodule or the node-o3-xml-v4 submodule

[01:07] t|f: what is the recommended way of organizing a big project, one that is organized into modules but modules that won't likely be used in other projects? Options seem to be (1) organize in dir tree under lib; (2) break into separate npm packages (possibly prefixed by project name); (3) use git submodulesl (4) something else?
[01:07] isaacs: t|f:  split into multiple modules.

[01:08] isaacs: t|f: whether you use submodules, published npm packages, unpublished npm packages, or private-registry-published npm packages, breaking into multiple small pieces with their own tests etc is almost alwyas the right answer.
[01:08] isaacs: split it up *now*,  before it's big and hard to break up
[01:08] isaacs: it's much easier at this point to start in the right direction.

[01:10] t|f: Cool, thx

[03:03] blueadept: xerox: what's interesting is that i have been lacking on my node testing
[03:03] unvamp: blueadept: i didn;t think they could pull it off, but they stopped that design by commity shit and let one person do his design magic
[03:03] blueadept: so about 1hr of node specific technical discussion on testing in particular is useful
[03:03] blueadept: yes
[03:03] blueadept: this is key
[03:04] blueadept: the design is killer
[03:04] blueadept: and by that i mean that it's just clean and it works and it's got good flow
[03:04] blueadept: this is what happens when you put engineers back in charge

[03:24] jerrysv: anyone have any thoughts about exposing private parts of modules for testing, but not in exports? is there an existing pattern for this?
[03:24] jslatts has joined the channel
[03:24] jesusabdullah: What if you wrapped private parts in submodules?
[03:24] jerrysv: i'm not sure i like that
[03:25] jerrysv: was thinking maybe defining test before the module inclusion
[03:25] mikegerwitz: jerrysv: Don't test your privates. It's testing too close to the implementation. If they must be tested, you need further abstraction.
[03:25] jerrysv: and: var test = test || { }
[03:25] mikegerwitz: Of course, this is pulling heavily from testing with classical OO code. I'm not sure how your code is structured.
[03:26] jerrysv: mikegerwitz: normally i'd agree with you, but i only want to expose one function, and keep the rest private, but since the one function i'm expsosing is "createServer()" i want to be able to either overwrite in the module, or include a mock in the module
[03:26] jerrysv: i don't like either of those
[03:27] jerrysv: or expose more
[03:27] jerrysv: i am planning on using mock request and response objects in the tests
[03:27] mikegerwitz: jerrysv: Well, in a classical OO sense, your solution would be to inject the necessary dependencies so they can be mocked. It's likely that your module is doing too much if you ened to test private members
[03:28] jerrysv: so, in this case, it's not really privates (i mispoke), but more testing parts that i don't want to expose as a public api
[03:28] mikegerwitz: jerrysv: Then create a facade that would glue it all together, and that wouldn't need to be tested in the same sense
[03:28] jerrysv: eg, i don't want to expose that part of the api as a contract
[03:28] howie has joined the channel
[03:28] jerrysv: hm.
[03:29] jerrysv: might complicate things a bit more, but that does give me room for thought
[03:29] mikegerwitz: jerrysv: That's what the facade is for :) to remove that complication and make the interface easy to use. I'm not sure the best way to go about what you're suggesting otherwise...
[03:30] mikegerwitz: jerrysv: You're encountering the same issues that most OOP do. The only difference here is that you're using "modules" instead of "classes"
[03:30] jerrysv: heh, true. and as i said, normally i'd agree
[03:30] howie: I'm having some trouble installing node from source on an ubuntu server.  I've gotten it to work before but am not sure what's different this time... Erroring out on the "make" step
[03:31] howie: anyone seen something like "Build failed:  -> task failed (err #2):  	{task: uv uv.h -> uv.a} "
[03:31] jerrysv: and i don't actually mind conceptually even making the request handler public
[03:31] jerrysv: hm. maybe i'll do that - that would add more flexibility anyways
[03:31] jerrysv: thanks for the sounding board!

[03:34] mikegerwitz: jerrysv: if you can find a copy or excerpts of the book "XUnit Test Patterns", it may have some useful tips in there too. It's been a while since I've looked it over, but you can apply many of the concepts to non-xunit-style testing
[03:35] mikegerwitz: jerrysv: dependency injection isn't the only solution
[03:36] jerrysv: i know, and i've been unit testing for years :) this is just a little bit different - not on the module front, but in what i'm trying to choose to expose
[03:36] mikegerwitz: jerrysv: ahh, alright then :)
[03:37] jerrysv: i'm looking for a tiny bit more freedom in the ability to change my api with very little consequences
[03:37] jerrysv: in short, i'm trying to be very selfish
[03:39] mikegerwitz: jerrysv: Well, if you change the public API, surely your tests will break regardless :)

[08:37] jonaslund: I loved require when i first discovered it.. unfortunally it goes badly with hot-code replacement/reloading
[08:37] jonaslund: (Then again most code does so if you don't think it through)
[08:40] tim_smart: jonaslund: I don't think hot code reloading is a very good idea with the v8 vm
[08:41] tim_smart: It isn't really designed for that
[08:41] tim_smart: Best method is to spin up more than one worker process and reload them one at a time.
[08:42] jonaslund: err,, you do know that you can push code changes at runtime from the eclipse plugin?
[08:42] jonaslund: but it wasn't that i was referring to

[08:45] tkroo has joined the channel
[08:45] tim_smart: But you have to intentionally structure your code differently to do it.
[08:45] tim_smart: It can lead to memory leaks etc.
[08:45] jonaslund: why would that lead to more memory leaks ?
[08:46] tim_smart: Creating aditional references that could get caught up in closures
[08:47] tim_smart: *additional
[08:47] jonaslund: assuming the closures get to live
[08:47] jonaslund: but closures are exactly why require is a bad match for hot code reloading
[08:48] tim_smart: erlang does it well because it was designed to do it well, v8 / node has not.
[08:48] jonaslund: it's more about JS
[08:49] jonaslund: code reloading is simple because you are really forced to behave well

[09:04] jonaslund: erl is pretty dynamic aswell.. but since they force all data to explicit structures and avoid circular refs it helps
[09:05] jonaslund: silly to compare them
[09:05] jonaslund: but since JS is dynamic hot reloading is just a step away
[09:06] jonaslund: the big question is if we should enforce conventions that makes it harder or easier
[09:07] jonaslund: for me atleast the thing that mainly resides in the global namespace is functions and constructors (and their prototypes)
[09:08] jonaslund: now require makes private namespaces.. and that is great for separation of data,etc but it doesn't help if you want to update things on the fly

[12:15] devaholic: i think its 0.4.7, but i could be wrong
[12:15] skript_ has joined the channel

[12:16] devaholic: i'd still give an earlier version of node a try, it's pretty easy to do
[12:16] devaholic: "engine": "node >=0.4.0"
[12:16] devaholic: thats pretty far from 0.4.9
[12:17] paul_uk: isn't he saying it should just be greater or equal to 0.4.0
[12:17] paul_uk: as in if you are 0.2.x then you should upgraed?
[12:17] devaholic: yes
[12:18] devaholic: but if he created it when 0.4.0 came out that was quite a while ago, is all
[12:18] devaholic: not really worth debating about

[12:21] johncarse: The "Path to Node App JS File" is your js that you want to debug
[12:22] johncarse: There is no "type" of project that is write for creating the initial project, from what I can tell.
[12:23] johncarse: You create a run/debug configuration with the path to node and the path to your js file.. you'll have one configuration for each, I guess
[12:23] johncarse: write.. right
[12:23] hash3g: hi there, could somebody help me with installing node.js from git? I have error https://gist.github.com/1055024.
[12:23] johncarse: And, when you click debug, it brings up the browser. 
[12:24] johncarse: ..I'm sorry.. not a browser.. it brings up the debug console.
[12:24] johncarse: You can set breakpoints, etc.. seems to work ok.
[12:24] paul_uk: Anyone here using Fedora (13) and running node-expat ?
[12:26] devaholic: johncarse sounds cool
[12:26] devaholic: is that the one that looks like the chrome debugger?
[12:27] johncarse: No, it doesn't quite look the chrome debugger... 
[12:27] johncarse: I found something called node-inspector that uses chrome to do the debugging.
[12:27] johncarse: I may switch to that.

[17:10] garbagegod: so just take this as a conceptual question, could i in theory use node.js and socket.io to make a web application where say two people would go to a page, and (just using this as an example) you could track their mouse movement or something and have it be sent to the other persons browser to display a little icon of a mouse where the other persons cursor is?
[17:10] garbagegod: the point in all this is just me asking if you can send information from one client through the server to another client 
[17:10] garbagegod: in realtime
[17:11] taf2: i think so

[18:34] kuya: couldnt those be detected as builtins tho?
[18:36] sreeix has joined the channel
[18:36] kuya: i wondered if it might be possible to add a method to objects that if exists signals dnode to use the return object from that function instead of the regular object

[18:38] kuya: maybe im thinking about this wrong

[18:48] kuya: hehe

[18:50] kuya: mydnodefunction: function(x, cb) { cb( {another_function: function() { ... }} ); }
[18:50] kuya: mostly because i cant see how that object can ever be gc'd

[18:51] SubStack: kuya: that works by design

[19:48] jesusabdullah: So, wait, does peanut generate tests, or is it its own test runner?
[19:48] jesusabdullah: or do I completely misunderstand cucumber? ;)
[19:48] malkomalko: it has it's own test runner, but you can use anything you want for assertions

[21:30] Edler: does ram affect how many people can connect to my node.js server
[21:30] Edler: ?
[21:31] chjj: edler: it depends on how much memory you allocate per connection

[21:31] Edler: does network relate to memory ?
[21:31] Prometheus: quad core server with 256mb sounds funky
[21:32] chjj: it depends on what youre doing, if youre sequencing the human genome for every connection, that will use a lot of memory
[21:32] Prometheus: or if you are using TLS :)
[21:32] chjj: on the other hand, if your http server is just a proxy-like server, you might not be using much memory

[21:38] chjj: level09: what is the function?
[21:38] dingomanatee: only methods that are designed to be asynchonous will block - generally speaking those are DB request related or file system related. 
[21:38] level09: chilts: I'm fetching a url 
[21:38] level09: using request

[21:38] level09: then I want to pass the result to express

[21:49] level09: yeah, I was just wondering if this technology attracts specific developers more than others
[21:49] dingomanatee: level09: I've only used node with MongoDB/Couch (hint hint) --- but my prediction is that 
[21:49] mrryanjohnston: level09: PHP 
[21:49] mrryanjohnston: ;)
[21:49] Swizec has joined the channel
[21:49] level09: ah cool 
[21:50] mrryanjohnston: and now I guess .Net
[21:50] level09: found one colleague :D
[21:50] wink_: at this point it seems to be a really wide distribution
[21:50] mrryanjohnston: whattup PHP bro
[21:50] dingomanatee: node might not make mysql faster "per se" but it will make concurrent access to mysql less consumptive of system resources. 
[21:50] level09: mrryanjohnston: have you tried integrating both php / node ?
[21:50] mrryanjohnston: level09: lollll no
[21:50] mrryanjohnston: level09: most I would do is make restful calls.
[21:50] mrryanjohnston: I wouldn't want to mix the two.
[21:50] dingomanatee: That is, you will have less spiking of cpu/memory usage if several processes are waiting for MySQL to complete. 
[21:51] mrryanjohnston: level09: though, tbh I have been keeping a close eye on the node.js module in drupal ;)
[21:51] _1marc has joined the channel
[21:51] level09: mrryanjohnston: saw that, it does nice notifications with sockets
[21:52] level09: dingomanatee: so I would only need to use it if I want some kind of distributed queries
[21:52] mega: yoole: if you call node -v what do you get?
[21:52] mrryanjohnston: level09: it does. but, to be honest, I'd rather make all of my future apps in node, and only use PHP if necessary
[21:52] mrryanjohnston: PHP is becomming the new .Net
[21:52] mrryanjohnston: ;
[21:52] mrryanjohnston: )
[21:52] level09: lol
[21:53] level09: php-fpm was really good though
[21:53] dingomanatee: Node functions well as a web service - so for instance if you wanted to display a data grid in PHP and poll a node web service for populating rows with data that would be a safe first step. 
[21:53] level09: dingomanatee: that seems like a great idea
[21:53] level09: btw
[21:53] level09: have any one did a comparison 
[21:54] level09: between a node server
[21:54] level09: ex : express.js
[21:54] level09: and nginx 
[21:54] flippyhead has joined the channel
[21:54] level09: both are event based
[21:54] level09: and have modules etc ..
[21:54] dingomanatee: The general consensus is that flat file serving is questionably better in node
[21:54] level09: I know some people still run nginx in front of node
[21:54] mrryanjohnston: I heard of some voodoo of people running node in nginx but Idkwtf that was about
[21:55] level09: to be on the safe side
[21:55] yoole: mega: if youre still there, i installed the sqlite module from npm and the program seems to be working now
[21:55] dingomanatee: but the reason most people end up on this channel is that node kicked ass against Ruby or PHP or .NET in terms of performance and concurrent resource usage. 
[21:55] yoole: now to just figure out what its doing :P

[22:01] mrryanjohnston: INTERNET.
[22:01] level09: that now.js must have changed
[22:01] level09: because socket.io has a completely new api
[22:01] dingomanatee: Simplicity is a useful metric, however the complexity of a codebase does not in and of itself drive a businesses sucess. It just changes your personal level of happiness. 
[22:01] level09: now.js is built on top of socket
[22:01] ryah: now.js is pretty cool
[22:01] level09: and socket is still experimental 
[22:01] mrryanjohnston: level09: touche
[22:02] ryah: dnode is pretty hot though:)
[22:02] dingomanatee: '<html><body><h1>Hello, world</h1></body></html>' - one line
[22:02] mrryanjohnston: level09: so you're saying it'd be even less lines now? ;)
[22:02] mrryanjohnston: dingomanatee: REAL TIME!!!
[22:02] davidwalsh has joined the channel
[22:02] mrryanjohnston: ryah: I think I'm too dumb to understand dnode
[22:02] dingomanatee: I can type pretty fast. 
[22:03] level09: yeah probably, but we're just waiting for the stable version to come out

[22:04] dingomanatee: load spikes, too. 
[22:04] chrisdickinson:  mrryanjohnston: you could do that in <5 lines: with(require('now')) { (everyone = initialize(httpServer)).distribute = function(msg) { everyone.now.recieve(this.now.name, message); }; }
[22:04] chrisdickinson: just to prove the argument that there are limits to the "less lines is more better" argument :)
[22:05] chrisdickinson: *s/argument$//g
[22:05] mrryanjohnston: chrisdickinson: Nice
[22:05] mrryanjohnston: though, to be fair, I wasn't saying more better by any stretch ;)
[22:06] mrryanjohnston: I mostly meant it to mean "pretty coo."

[22:07] Prometheus: dingomanatee: couldn't agree more with your statement about simplicity =)
[22:07] Prometheus: been there, felt that
[22:08] perezd has joined the channel
[22:08] dingomanatee: I do like simplicity - I do think it is a long term asset - however I would point out that Microsoft has so far been one of the best providers of simple/RAD systems - they really cater to that market - and it has not played out well because their products have performance issues. 
[22:08] kylefox has left the channel
[22:09] dingomanatee: I mean, Access is by far the "Simplest" database. Or perhaps whatever they are calling Filemaker nowadays.
[22:10] Prometheus: simplistic vs simple =)
[22:11] Edler: Anyone here can really help in coding a Node.JS chat room ?
[22:11] Edler: I'll pay
[22:11] xerox: come on
[22:12] xerox: are your really that unable to google >_>
[22:13] mrryanjohnston: Edler bro
[22:13] mrryanjohnston: imma help you save some money
[22:13] Edler: mrryanjohnston, how ?
[22:13] mrryanjohnston: http://spechal.com/2011/03/19/super-simple-node-js-chatroom/
[22:13] mrryanjohnston: bam
[22:13] Jakwac: char rooms are kind of the "hello world" of nodejs.
[22:13] Edler: xerox: it's an advanced chatroom, not a simple one
[22:13] mrryanjohnston: 50 dollarz plz.
[22:14] xerox: use irc :X
[22:14] Edler: well i need sessions
[22:14] mega: dahl did a presentation where he wrote a simple chat
[22:14] Edler: sql logging
[22:14] Prometheus: :s
[22:14] Edler: private query chats
[22:14] Edler: an irc clone
[22:14] bitwise_: getting an error trying to load howtonode.org. i npm install wheat and cloned the repo for htn, then i see Object has no method 'conditionalGet' in app.js
[22:15] bitwise_: maybe a connectjs question
[22:15] mrryanjohnston: Edler: https://github.com/alexyoung/ircd.js
[22:15] mrryanjohnston: and irc daemon
[22:15] rfay has joined the channel
[22:15] mrryanjohnston: an*
[22:15] mrryanjohnston: that will be 100 dollarz.
[22:15] mrryanjohnston: yew ess dowlars
[22:16] Edler: so i can run my own irc server on node.js ?
[22:16] Jakwac: yep
[22:16] mrryanjohnston: Edler: it would appear that way!
[22:16] Edler: and i can connect and interact with it using html5 websockets ?
[22:16] mrryanjohnston: Edler: I dunno, perhaps you should click the link ;)
[22:16] Edler: and of course i can customize it since it's open source
[22:16] xerox: mrryanjohnston: you're getting rich so fast!
[22:17] mrryanjohnston: xerox: gonna retire early
[22:17] micheil: Edler: you'd need to make a irc server, and connect it together with websockets
[22:17] micheil: or, you can write a proxy service
[22:17] Edler: isn't ircd an irc server ?
[22:17] Edler: or at least one written in node.js
[22:17] micheil: something that connects to an irc server and proxies that to a websocket connection
[22:17] xerox: mrryanjohnston: google a node implementation of jabber daemon, it's on Edler 
[22:18] micheil: Edler: you've just given me a new pusherapp idea. :D
[22:18] Edler: okay guys listen
[22:18] Edler: irc is a good idea since i can have channels
[22:18] Edler: what i'm trying to do is have the visitors on my website
[22:18] micheil: (I work for pusher, hence the reason I say that)
[22:18] Edler: see a mini chatroom
[22:18] Edler: which is real time
[22:18] micheil: Edler: sounds like a perfect use for pusher.com :/
[22:19] Edler: using websockets
[22:19] micheil: exactly.
[22:19] Edler: pusher.com ?
[22:19] micheil: yeah
[22:19] Edler: opening
[22:19] micheil: we do websockets as a service
[22:19] Edler: micheil: explain to me more
[22:19] Edler: what do you provide ?
[22:19] micheil: all you need to do would be to write the connector between an irc client and a pusher connection.
[22:19] niftylettuce has joined the channel
[22:20] micheil: we provide things like a standard channels and events layer on top of websockets (things that you'd normally implement yourself)
[22:20] Edler: but that's way too expensive for me
[22:20] Edler: i prefer managing my own server
[22:20] micheil: not so, for now it's all free.
[22:20] Edler: than subscribing to a server
[22:20] Edler: service
[22:20] Edler: i see 100 connection and 200 000 message per day
[22:20] Edler: 100 connection won't do 
[22:21] xerox: https://github.com/tarnfeld/PusherChat
[22:21] Edler: i need at least 3000
[22:21] micheil: okay, well, just remember, there's no such thing as a free lunch; somewhere along the lines you'll pay for it.
[22:21] Edler: i want to pay
[22:21] Edler: but not for my push usage
[22:21] bergie has joined the channel
[22:22] Edler: i'll pay for my server
[22:22] Edler: which includes rent and bandwidth
[22:22] micheil: Edler: okay then :)
[22:22] Edler: :D
[22:22] Edler: but thanks for the info
[22:22] Edler: however this node.js thingy is still confusing me
[22:22] Edler: i'm used to client side js scripting
[22:22] micheil: but at any rate, you could easily prototype on our service (I'm actually going to do that idea now, just as another proof of concept of a new thing we're working on)
[22:23] Edler: now ?
[22:23] micheil: soon.
[22:23] sechrist: Can I access environment / some kind of global variable inside of the express templates, or do I have to explicitly pass them to render every time?
[22:23] tjholowaychuk: sechrist: look at the docs/examples
[22:23] tjholowaychuk: many ways
[22:23] tjholowaychuk: app.helpers() etc
[22:23] sechrist: I've been looking, I haven't found an example yet
[22:23] micheil: I'm currently working on tests for our javascript library, and as part of that, I'm writing a client-side javascript async testing framework.
[22:23] sechrist: maybe I'm just bad at sifting through docs
[22:26] bitwise_: how do i get the conditionalGet middleware?

[22:27] tjholowaychuk: and wasteful
