[00:18] bingomanatee: what is the best mysql drivers for node?
[00:19] augustl: in my postgres db, I have a primary key with an auto incrementing sequence. Is there a way to get that value from the callback of an INSERT statement, or do I have to do a query?
[00:19] bingomanatee: MatthewMueller: I am pretty sure you can dispense with the routing by simply saying app.all('*', all_handler) with express. 
[00:20] bbttxu has joined the channel
[00:21] bingomanatee: Also if you have a directory pattern that is consistent with your app you can create a generic parser as in app.get(':model/:controller/:whatever*', handler) and get some useful variables up front. You'll want to eyeball the express routing docs/functions closer to make sure thorugh. 
[00:21] admc has joined the channel
[00:21] augustl: brianc: ping, if you can spare a moment (see above)
[00:21] chapel: bingomanatee: app.all the all is for get/put/post/del
[00:21] chapel: or whatever
[00:22] bingomanatee: yeah. I realized I boned the example .
[00:22] pauls: you guys are awesome. i didn't know that
[00:22] bingomanatee: but app.all is the rigth one. 
[00:22] chapel: but app.use, is used for all views
[00:22] piscisaureus: ryah: köln, this year, really?
[00:22] bingomanatee: use??
[00:22] chapel: app.use is like for connect middleware
[00:22] chapel: like a logger
[00:22] chapel: or a prebuilt error handler
[00:22] bingomanatee: okay. 
[00:23] chapel: but you can also add your own code as long as it follows function (req, res, next)

[00:30] chapel: I haven't used it, but look at the things that are used with .use
[00:30] MatthewMueller: It's not clear how to author middleware that's based on connect using express dependencies.
[00:31] MatthewMueller: Yah, I'm trying, but its confusing :-P

[01:19] cainus: hey... anyone have experience hooking connect-auth up to express ?
[01:19] atmos: yup
[01:20] cainus: to use it I need connect.createServer() ?  for express I need express.createServer() ... I'ma bit baffled
[01:20] atmos: i've used the github and twitter auth
[01:21] cainus: not sure how I can use both when that's the api
[01:21] cainus: just trying to get basic http auth
[01:21] atmos: https://github.com/atmos/http-pulse-app/blob/master/lib/app.js
[01:21] sveimac: its just middleware
[01:21] atmos: that app should still work i think
[01:21] atmos: it's from august
[01:22] wdperson has joined the channel
[01:23] cainus: isn't connect-auth the preferred way to do basic http auth?
[01:23] cainus: seems like that example is using something else
[01:24] atmos: https://github.com/atmos/http-pulse-app/blob/master/lib/app.js#L34
[01:24] bingomanatee: Interesting channel trivia - though there are many "aliases", there have been nearly 4,000 discrete logins in the node.js channel. 
[01:24] atmos: that should be using connect auth, i just have it as the Auth constant
[01:24] sveimac: cainus:  http://nodetuts.com/tutorials/13-authentication-in-express-sessions-and-route-middleware.html#video

[01:28] cainus: hmmm that doesn't look like basic http auth
[01:28] cainus: shouldn't need sessions as far as I know
[01:30] sveimac: might remember wrong, but doesnt it use connect-auth?
[01:30] sveimac: via express?
[01:30] cainus: it's express, but I don't see connect-auth used
[01:30] cainus: and it's not basic http auth

[03:53] piscisaureus: thnx all
[03:54] silence has joined the channel
[03:55] mscdex: Lorentz: no draft 76 websockets through any reverse proxy except node
[03:56] mscdex: not sure about the latest version/draft
[03:57] warz: i dont even think websockets work anywhere other than chrome and iphone safari, from what ive seen
[03:58] iszak: nothing wrong with that.
[03:58] iszak: Firefox 4 no doubt supports it too, but not out yet obviously. I would rather have websockets with longpolling fallback.
[03:58] micheil: yeah drafts prior to -05 or -04 won't work through most proxies
[03:58] Lorentz: Thought ff4 dropped websockets due to that security thing.
[03:59] Lorentz: Or did they put it back in?
[03:59] iszak: oh wow
[03:59] iszak: No you're probably right.
[03:59] warz: last i read it was dropped
[03:59] micheil: as for most browsers, they are currently either disabling them or actively working on -04+
[03:59] micheil: firefox and opera have disabled websockets
[03:59] micheil: safari is unconfirmed
[04:00] micheil: chrome is continuing to have websockets, as they can upgrade every user of their browser in about 24 hours supposedly
[04:00] dipser_ has joined the channel
[04:00] iszak: more browsers should take that approach
[04:01] micheil: as far as chrome and google are concerned, that while there is an expliot, it's something that's existed in flash and java for far longer
[04:01] iszak: All browsers should basically be rolling releases.
[04:01] Lorentz: It's really the fault of badly implemented proxies, as far as I could tell.
[04:01] micheil: as it was through flash and java plugins that this hack was possible
[04:01] Lorentz: But nobody wants to fix those.
[04:02] mscdex: iirc firefox 4 has websocket support built-in, it's just disabled by default
[04:02] micheil: actually, Lorentz, having data after the headers in a request, but not declaring that data in Content-Length or transfer-encoding chunked is against spec, iirc
[04:02] micheil: mscdex: right.
[04:02] ReshadN: Success! Running Node.js 0.2.6 on my new mac!

[04:03] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[04:04] Lorentz: micheil: Hmm, I see
[04:05] ReshadN: that sounds like a challenge. Is 0.3.7 or 0.3.8 stable?
[04:06] gkatsev: ff4 does have websocket support, however, it is disabled by default.
[04:08] Twelve-60: the data event on net.Stream(), can i make it wait until newline?
[04:08] Twelve-60: or do i have to keep reading it
[04:08] Twelve-60: until newline
[04:09] iszak: ReshadN, neither are stable, the whole 0.3.x is classified as unstable AFAIK
[04:10] ReshadN: how do i revert back? 
[04:10] amerine has joined the channel
[04:12] mscdex: Twelve-60: just keep buffering the data into a variable until you see a newline
[04:12] ReshadN: 0.2.6 running like a dream
[04:13] fairwinds: am just looking for simple in memory cache for express. what are my options?
[04:14] pauls: @ReshadN as isaacs taught me earlier today, there are a few utils you can use to manage your node version, like nave and nvm. you can install them via npm (node package manager) by doing something like `npm install nave`. if you use nave then you can do something like this, `nave usemain 0.2.6` if you want to revert back to 0.2.6

[04:43] sechrist: Man this is kind of a mess
[04:43] ROBOTARMY has joined the channel
[04:44] Aria: That's one option. Or just install them into node_modules.
[04:44] sstephenson: sechrist: you can `npm link` in the git checkout
[04:44] Aria: (I have ~/Projects and npm links into ~/.node_modules)
[04:44] sechrist: I'd prefer not to use npm
[04:44] sechrist: I have to automate this to be deployed
[04:45] sstephenson: npm bundle helps with deployment
[04:45] sechrist: actually it may just be easier to hack node itself to add more library search paths
[04:45] sechrist: :\
[04:45] beawesomeinstead has joined the channel
[04:45] iszak: sechrist, don't resist, give in to npm
[04:46] sechrist: well I know for a fact I can't even use the npm repo
[04:46] iszak: i mean do you really want to use trunk builds?
[04:46] sechrist: those machines don't have routes to the inet
[04:46] sstephenson: you can depend on urls in package.json - if the git repo is on github, you can use the tarball url from the download button for a specific revision
[04:46] sstephenson: or have a local mirror
[04:46] ReshadN has joined the channel
[04:46] iszak: sechrist, so why not just git clone remove the git directory and put it directly in .node_modules, not like you'd be doing a git pull anytime soon.
[04:47] sstephenson: so you can just give your app a package.json file, then run npm bundle on the server after you deploy
[04:47] zzak: cool, got my nodester invite :)
[04:47] sechrist: the .node_modules is throwing me off
[04:47] Aria: Er. .node_libraries.
[04:47] sechrist: our convention is to have libraries and stuff inside a directory with our app
[04:48] sechrist: so chef doesn't have to screw with user-specific things
[04:48] sstephenson: npm bundle installs all dependencies in node_modules/
[04:48] andrewfff has joined the channel
[04:48] Aria: You can do that, too, you know. (and it's a good practice for publishing and deploying things that need to keep dependencies tight.)
[04:48] sechrist: how can I do that without manually hacking the require paths of every module?
[04:48] sechrist: or is that the minimum level of pain to endure?
[04:49] sechrist: it seems that require.paths.unshift() doesn't seem into included modules.
[04:49] sechrist: seep*
[04:50] Aria: It should. Also, you can set it in the environment.
[04:51] sechrist: ahh that is much better
[04:51] sechrist: that's what we do for LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PYTHONPATH
[04:51] Aria: That's underused, I think.
[04:51] shaver: do we need a virtualenv for node?

[05:00] warz: hrm. im trying to get express.js to handle an "OPTIONS" request. does anyone have any pointers as to how to handle this type? i recall seeing how to do this in the docs, i think, but i cant seem to locate it now.
[05:00] pauls: thanks! i use mongoose, myself, but have been considering looking into the native driver so that i can get support for map reduce 
[05:01] iszak: Is there any ambitions to port console.profile(name) and console.profileEnd(name); to Node.js?
[05:01] bingomanatee: I have got map reduce down - I'll put the docs up tomorrow
[05:02] bingomanatee: its a real ballbuster
[05:02] iszak: Because having the profile methods would be greatly beneficial.
[05:03] pkrumins: Hey, anyone wants to contract hire a talented node.js developer (me)? Looking to making some additional money. I am best at writing C++ bindings for node.js! I am the StackVM / Browserling guy and I run the http://www.catonmat.net blog. Basically if we can't raise money within end of February, I will want to do contract work.
[05:03] micheil: iskren: I think they may already exist
[05:03] micheil: iszak: see console.time and console.timeEnd
[05:04] micheil: iszak: is the console module documented?
[05:04] pauls: @pkrumins you might want to try hacker news.  i've heard people have some succeess there
[05:04] pkrumins: dont want to go that public with that
[05:05] pauls: ic
[05:05] pauls: goodl uck though :)
[05:05] pkrumins: thx
[05:05] iszak: micheil, nay
[05:05] micheil: iszak: could you create an issue on github.com/votizen/node/issues to document it?
[05:05] iszak: the fact that console.time isn't mentioned in the documentation?
[05:06] andrewfff has joined the channel
[05:06] micheil: yeah, if that console module isn't documented, just say "Document "console" module

[05:09] iszak: is there any way to load a module export via a variable? e.g. var require('foo').variable? 
[05:10] Aria: var variable = require('foo') ?
[05:11] iszak: sorry
[05:11] iszak: i meant like var xyz = require('foo').variable;
[05:11] Aria: Sure.
[05:11] Aria: just set exports.variable in the module.
[05:11] micheil: yeah, if 'foo' exports variable
[05:13] iszak: no variable is a variable.

[05:36] Sumit: Can you please (any one) can provide any  guidelines to understand node.js code
[05:36] Aria: The code of the interpreter, or code written to use node.js?
[05:36] Sumit: code written to use node.js
[05:36] micheil: Sumit: I would suggest learning the JavaScript language first, the Mozilla Developer Center has a fairly decent tutorial for doing this
[05:36] atmos has joined the channel
[05:36] Sumit: e.g; http.js
[05:37] Sumit: buffer.js
[05:37] micheil: as for understanding the actual code of node.js, it generally requires a high level of knowledge of JavaScript and some knowledge of C/C++
[05:37] Sumit: I have good knowledge of C/C++
[05:37] Sumit: but for javascript nothing!!
[05:38] Sumit: But basic stuff of javascripts I can understand
[05:38] micheil: I would also suggest that you look at the API documentation: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.2.6/api.html
[05:38] micheil: (that's for the current stable release of Node.js, for the unstable releases, see: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.3.6/api/
[05:39] Sumit: But it uses what -- prototypes, customized objects ,exports etc
[05:39] Sumit: Is there any documentation which tells anything about its code ?
[05:39] micheil: not really.
[05:39] Sumit: All eample just explain *Hello World!*
[05:39] warz: Ah. I see the master version of Express supports app.options()
[05:39] micheil: Node.js follows the CommonJS patterns, but only loosely
[05:39] EyePulp has joined the channel
[05:39] warz: Guess it's time to move to master.
[05:40] micheil: Sumit: if you are just starting to learn JavaScript / Node.js, then I wouldn't really suggest diving straight into the node core code.
[05:40] Sumit: That's what I am going to do on next -- trying to understand CommonJs Stuff
[05:40] stride has joined the channel
[05:40] micheil: Sumit: a popular thing to do is to write API wrapper modules, or database drivers or similar
[05:40] Sumit: Actually as my work assignments  require some changes in code, 
[05:41] Sumit: I suppose to write http-proxy app by using node.js 
[05:41] micheil: the main pieces of CommonJS that node uses are explained in the documentation
[05:41] Sumit: Node.Js documentation ?
[05:41] micheil: Sumit: okay, so you'd need something that is a http.Server and a http.Client
[05:42] Sumit: Yes
[05:42] micheil: see above for the documentation links
[05:42] micheil: they can both also be found on http://nodejs.org
[05:43] Sumit: Yes - Micheil, I have already installed node.js in my system, and I can easily understand node.js http client/server
[05:43] micheil: okay, so you just need to figure out how to connect it all up
[05:43] Sumit: On next - I suppose to write some APIs by using node.js frameworks, and it also require to add some plugins for file transfer etc.

[05:46] Sumit: Thanks Micheil
[05:46] Sumit: You are right , I am doing in similar way
[05:47] iszak: how do I inject variables into a module?
[05:47] Sumit: I have already understood this http.client/server stuff, studied all node.js apis etc !! // thanks I will follow the way you explained just
[05:48] micheil: iszak: as in?
[05:48] iszak: hmm.
[05:49] iszak: dw
[05:49] iszak: for now..
[05:49] micheil: generally information is passed about either as variables or function arguments
[05:49] micheil: myModule.myvar = "foo"
[05:49] micheil: myModule = require("myModule")
[05:50] micheil: (reverse those two lines)
[05:50] iszak: ah, perfect.
[05:50] micheil: and then myModule just needs to know that myvar exists
[05:50] micheil: that assumes that myModule is an instance of myModule
[05:51] micheil: iszak: for example, see the code at http://github.com/votizen/facebook-graph-client

[06:10] micheil: aaronblohowiak: node will never be finished; and when it is, will use it.

[06:11] aaronblohowiak: iszak: i'm going to go to bed then.
[06:11] iszak: my fault, I should've elaborated.
[06:12] iszak: Basically I want to pass a variable to the module I'm loading.
[06:13] wadey: iszak: not sure how well I can explain, but the way I do this is by exporting a function from my module
[06:13] wadey: in the module:
[06:14] wadey: module.exports = function(settings) { return {a: 1, b: 2} }
[06:14] wadey: then, when you want to use it
[06:14] wadey: require('./module')(settings)
[06:14] matyr has joined the channel
[06:14] iszak: is that standard practice?
[06:14] MikhX has joined the channel
[06:15] wadey: i'm not sure, it seems to work pretty well for me
[06:15] aaronblohowiak: iszak: yes. your module should generate new things for the libraries that consume it, it should not be shared across its consumers
[06:15] aaronblohowiak: think of your module like a factory
[06:15] aaronblohowiak: and the things that require() it, the consumers
[06:17] softdrink has joined the channel
[06:18] iszak: still don't understand, but wadey thanks for the module.exports, that helped with something else

[06:18] wadey: no problem!
[06:19] matyr has joined the channel
[06:20] iszak: is it advised to use full paths, relative paths in require?
[06:20] Aria: Depends on what you want. You almost never want full paths.
[06:20] iszak: really?
[06:20] Aria: Yeah. Things get moved and installed and whatnot ;-)
[06:20] iszak: I would've assumed full paths always as otherwise it'll have to resolve.
[06:21] iszak: full path based on __dir that is.
[06:21] Aria: No, don't do that. use ./ for that.
[06:21] Aria: If it's part of the same structure, use ./ or ../whatever. (foo.js and bar.js in the same directory, require('./bar') in foo.js, etc.)
[06:21] iszak: but wouldn't it have to resolve ./ all the time?
[06:21] Aria: All what time?
[06:21] iszak: well it'll have to resolve ./ to a full path
[06:22] Aria: It has to resolve it when you call it, sure. 
[06:22] Aria: What do you think _dir is?
[06:22] Aria: or __dirname, actually.
[06:22] iszak: it's a full path of the current directory the file is in.
[06:22] Aria: It's not a complicated resolution. It's not a critical path either.
[06:22] Aria: That's called resolution ;-)
[06:22] iszak: so what's wrong with using __dirname?
[06:22] Aria: It's complicated.
[06:22] Aria: It's the same thing as ./.
[06:23] wadey: it's key to know that './' is relative to __dirname, not to the current working directoy. So it should always do what you want
[06:23] wadey: you dont have to worry about it
[06:23] iszak: oh wait
[06:24] iszak: so if I do like node /path/to/folder/script.js it'll use the current directory I'm in not /path/to/folder/ ?
[06:24] wadey: require('./file') will use the diretory that the script is in
[06:24] wadey: not the current working directory
[06:24] Aria: Right.
[06:24] wadey: './file' === __dirname + '/file'
[06:24] iszak: I understand what the relative path is.
[06:24] aaronblohowiak: cwd is used by file, but not require.  interesting inconsistency i hadn't noticed before, but matches what i expect
[06:25] iszak: I think I want __dirname.
[06:25] aaronblohowiak: iszak: you are just typing more unnecessarily if you use __dirname
[06:25] Aria: Yeah.

[06:26] aaronblohowiak: Aria: that does not matter

[06:29] aaronblohowiak: iszak: eh?
[06:30] aaronblohowiak: Aria: also, sorry about the gender confusion =/
[06:30] iszak: it's a user defined variable that's being used throughout the application.
[06:30] Aria: Hehe, no worries. I'm rather used to that.
[06:30] iszak: so i'm using like var.path
[06:31] aaronblohowiak: iszak: well, if you really really absolutely must have a global variable... there is a way
[06:31] aaronblohowiak: i heard that it requires a blood sacrifice, though
[06:31] iszak: well it's not global per say.
[06:31] iszak: it's a "module" kinda, which is really just an object.
[06:31] aaronblohowiak: iszak: "per se"
[06:31] Aria: Like a configuration object? 
[06:32] iszak: aaronblohowiak, meh.
[06:32] Aria: A list of settings?
[06:32] iszak: Aria, yes like a config obj.
[06:32] Aria: The kind of thing that /is/ nearly global, eh?
[06:32] iszak: not necessarily.
[06:33] matyr_ has joined the channel
[06:33] aaronblohowiak: if you need to pass its values around as a dependency, use the module-as-factories.. if you need it to be a global, then go that route.. there *is* a way to evaluate a script within a given context, but you probably dont want to do that

[09:18] bingomanatee: Okay I put up an article on map/reduce and Christkov's mongodb native libs here: http://wonderlandlabs.com/wll_drupal/os/node/mongodb/map_reduce.html
[09:18] bingomanatee: enjoy. Hopefully it will save someone the grind I had to go through to get it. 
[09:18] chapel: couchdb
[09:18] chapel: :)
[09:18] bingomanatee: It's on the way. 
[09:19] bingomanatee: Let's just say it will come after Rails. 
[09:19] chapel: well no need for couchdb guide, well maybe useful for some people, but its really straight forward in node
[09:19] chapel: good on you getting stuff out though
[09:19] bingomanatee: Yeah - can't say I've been overjoyed with my MongoDB experience in node. 
[09:20] bingomanatee: Fairly excruciating - not that PHP was much better. 
[09:20] chapel: heh
[09:20] chapel: have you played with couchdb?

[09:20] bingomanatee: Not yet. I was going to crash test it with a client but he finked on me. 
[09:20] skm has joined the channel
[09:20] chapel: you should play with it
[09:21] bingomanatee: I have a pretty tight schedule of private tasks. Couch is definately on the plate but RoR is first. 
[09:21] bingomanatee: I think it would be cool. 
[09:21] chapel: its pretty nice, really simple, but powerful
[09:21] mscdex: SubStack: there is no way to skip an arbitrary number of bytes with node-binary?
[09:21] bingomanatee: I Definately want to do Couch and Redis this year. 
[09:21] chapel: ror, why ror?
[09:21] mscdex: SubStack: i saw node-bufferlist had something like that
[09:21] bingomanatee: Well, its a thing I've not tried yet. 
[09:21] bingomanatee: Want to see what all the fuss is about. 
[09:21] chapel: eh
[09:21] chapel: before node, I would have said try it
[09:22] chapel: but all it will do is show how great node is
[09:22] chapel: so hell, try it
[09:23] bingomanatee: I've noticed that it has set a few industry standards for Rest ET ALL and as I do want to create more industry standard components for Node I think I'll find it at least a little instructive. 
[09:23] dekz: anyone know if it's possible to tunnel a node.js HTTP client using tsocks?
[09:23] bingomanatee: Right now my points of reference for frameworks are Zend Framework, Drupal (leave me alone), XOOPS,  Joomla, and Express. 
[09:24] chapel: heh bingomanatee
[09:24] SubStack: mscdex: there's no skip() in binary but there is buffer()
[09:24] chapel: well express is based on sinatra
[09:24] chapel: which is a ruby framework

[09:27] ajcates: any body willing to help me?

[09:28] bingomanatee: Does it play well with Express or just replace it?
[09:28] lumino has joined the channel
[09:28] SubStack: the heck, some bug slipped into binary, fixing that too
[09:29] mscdex: SubStack: also, what about a method that advances the offset until a certain string of bytes is found?
[09:29] chapel: bingomanatee: doesn't replace it
[09:29] chapel: well, depends on what you are making
[09:29] mscdex: maybe that could be the same method
[09:30] mscdex: .skip() that takes an number or an array
[09:30] bingomanatee: Well I hope to have fun. 
[09:30] SubStack: mscdex: sounds useful
[09:30] bingomanatee: I am actually starting to wish that the industry wasn't so hot right now. 
[09:31] bingomanatee: Getting a HUGE amount of traffic / work - honestly haven't seen demand like this since the mid 90's. 
[09:31] bingomanatee: Feels perverse with so many people on the rocks. 
[09:33] bingomanatee: Night all.

[09:34] ajcates: i think thats the logging module i use

[09:34] ajcates: i really want to figure out how i can load a dir into an object
[09:34] ajcates: it will make working with templates and stuff retardly easy
[09:35] ajcates: also after i have them loaded into an object i have to parse them with the haml module
[09:35] iszak: why would it make it retardly easy?
[09:36] ajcates: becuase
[09:36] ajcates: i could just call templates.common.nav

[10:38] ajcates: this is way above me
[10:38] ajcates: wtf is a new line terminited line
[10:39] mamassiv: yeah, i read out a protocol that runs over tcp
[10:39] mamassiv: a device sends positions to the server
[10:39] mamassiv: and every message is terminated by a new line
[10:40] mamassiv: so carrier helps you so you don't have to parse stuff for new lines, but you just get the message in one chunk

[13:29] okuryu has joined the channel
[13:31] Aikar: jetienne: 3rd party code may be sloppy and not use hasownproperty when doing for (var i in Object); but if your using your own code / good code from others, its not a problem
[13:32] Aikar: jetienne: or always use Object.defineProperty(Object.prototype, 'blah'  as that sets enumerable to false by default so it wont be in for(var i = in obj)
[13:32] jetienne: Aikar: so you think it may be ok for modify Math.* and such ?
[13:32] Aikar: yep, if you use Object.defineProperty its safe in Node world
[13:32] jetienne: Aikar: you are not afraid of the conflict with other libraries ? they may do the same
[13:33] Aikar: jetienne: if you use defineproperty, it wont affect other libs
[13:33] Aikar: in browser world, not all browsers have defineProperty so thats an issue
[13:33] Aikar: but in node, you have it, so your golden
[13:33] jetienne: Aikar: hmmm maybe i dont understand defineProperty then
[13:33] Aikar: its the same thing as doing object.blah but it sets some hidden flags and such
[13:33] Aikar: lets you do getter/setter etc
[13:34] Aikar: its an internal v8 thing
[13:34] Aikar: !google Object.defineProperty
[13:34] jetienne: Aikar: if i create a Math.slota, and you do the same, and both code are running together... this will conflict no ?
[13:34] jetienne: my Math.slota gonna crush yours, or the opposite, no ?
[13:35] Mike_Rice has joined the channel
[13:35] Aikar: well anytime your doing it for code to share, id say its not a good idea to modify core, but for self use its fine. so most likely no lib you load will be doing it
[13:36] Aikar: but yes if 2 ppl tried someones gets erased
[13:36] jetienne: ah ok :)
[13:37] jetienne: one of my code provider is modifying global stuff, so i look for a reference that no it is not "everyone is modyfying global prototypes" :)
[13:37] chrischris has joined the channel

[14:16] Mike_Rice: I'm writing a module that has a namespace wrapper, like.
[14:17] Mike_Rice: exports.Bob = function(jquery) { exports.config = {foo: "bar"};};
[14:17] Mike_Rice: one, am I exporting correctly
[14:17] sveimac: its module.exports
[14:17] Mike_Rice: and two, would I do this to access foo
[14:17] Mike_Rice: bob = require("Bob");
[14:17] Mike_Rice: myvar = bob.foo
[14:18] Mike_Rice: the doc just says exports.
[14:18] Mike_Rice: actually, I meant to say, myvar = bob.config.foo
[14:19] chrisfrog: huys
[14:19] garrensmith: Mike_Rice:  its just exports.foo = "bar"
[14:19] chrisfrog: guys
[14:19] chrisfrog: What is the best way to create a https server?
[14:20] garrensmith: Mike_Rice:  why have function(jquery) ?
[14:20] Mike_Rice: garrensmith, I'll be passing in a jquery object to do DOM manipulation
[14:20] Mike_Rice: from JSDom
[14:21] Mike_Rice: I'm writing a screenscraper and pulling out certain fields from the Dom to store in a DB
[14:21] garrensmith: Mike_Rice:  ok then Exports.Bod = function(jQuery) { return exports.config = {foo: "bar"};};
[14:22] garrensmith: *s/Bod/bob
[14:22] garrensmith: Mike_Rice:  oops sorry remove exports.config and just make it config
[14:22] Mike_Rice: garrensmith, and if I'm defining multiple functions in there?
[14:23] Mike_Rice: won't return end execution
[14:23] Mike_Rice: it's a wrapper class for multiple methods
[14:23] Mike_Rice: I don't know the javascript nomenclature
[14:23] garrensmith: Mike_Rice:  OK, you want to return the object with all the functions from Bob

[14:56] fairwinds: am still quite new to node. am interested in using a couple libs in global scope such as a date lib or lib that provides notion of a class. If I just require these libs without doing anything to wrap them with exports, I am assuming they will be available to node in global scope

[15:55] jeromegn: Anyone has experience with mongoose? specifically unique indexes returning a new model even though that index is not respected and the mongodb database does not create a record...
[15:55] weepy has joined the channel
[15:55] pauls: @jeromegn what do you mean by returning a new model? do you mean that the unique idx already exists in an object in the mongo db?
[15:56] weepy: hiya - is it possible to require specific versions of libraries that have been installed via npm ? 
[15:57] jeromegn: pauls: my "email" field is set to be an index and to be unique. If I create two instances of that model with the same email, the save callback returns a new model with the created_at being different and all, but the email is the same... mongodb does not create a new record in the database though... I'm puzzled. I thought it should throw an error.

[16:00] tmpvar: see mjsunit.runner for runtime args
[16:01] tmpvar: Mike_Rice, use HEAD or wait a few days
[16:01] tmpvar: for 0.1.24
[16:01] jeromegn: pauls: yup. https://github.com/LearnBoost/mongoose/issues/#issue/194 (basically in my mongodb shell if I getIndexes(), I see it there being just fine... so I'm guessing mongoose registers it properly)
[16:01] Mike_Rice: how do I pull HEAD?

[16:02] djanowski: tmpvar: cool, thx
[16:02] tmpvar: Mike_Rice, do you know how to use git?

[16:02] tmpvar: ok
[16:03] Mike_Rice: git pull http://github/tmpvar/jsdom...?
[16:03] tmpvar: so if you go: git clone http://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom.git && cd jsdom && npm link .
[16:03] tmpvar: you should have HEAD installed
[16:03] pauls: @jeromegn not sure i'll be of much help in this case... you've actually got yours set up differently from mine. you might want to check this out http://dailyjs.com/2010/12/06/node-tutorial-5/
[16:04] pauls: @jeromegn i use something like that, where you go "mongoose.model(..." to define the model
[16:04] jeromegn: pauls: Oh yes, I used to use that, but mongoose got updated and the API changed a lot! I like it better for the relationships between my models, but if that bug persists then it doesn't make much sense to use it :(
[16:05] davglass has joined the channel
[16:06] pauls: jeromegn wow it has changed a lot... it's been a while since i looked at the mongoose github page. i've had to write so much code to manage relationships but it sounds like i might be better of not upgrading yet :\

[16:15] pengwynn has joined the channel
[16:15] piscisaureus: suppose you were installing a package with npm on a native-windows nodejs
[16:15] piscisaureus: where would it go?
[16:15] Aikar: hmm
[16:16] piscisaureus: on linux it goes to ~/.node_modules
[16:16] Kingdutch: Good question
[16:16] Aikar: i was going to write my own MongoDB class since mongo was in bad shape before, but looks like 1.0 is looking really good. saves me the trouble that its finally out with documentation!
[16:16] Kingdutch: Is npm windows native or is it run through cygwin?
[16:16] Aikar: since mongoose*
[16:16] Kingdutch: I think it depends on your cygwin config (Seeing as node isn't native windows yet, is it)
[16:16] piscisaureus: on windows it should be either My Documents/.node-modules or users/yourname/appdata/roaming
[16:16] Kingdutch: Otherwise, look in your user folder
[16:16] Aikar: Kingdutch: npm is just js code
[16:16] konobi: piscisaureus: probably under USERDATA in your user account
[16:16] Aikar: Kingdutch: no binary to it
[16:16] Kingdutch: my bad
[16:16] Kingdutch: oh well
[16:17] piscisaureus: npm is not currently currently supported on the native windows build.
[16:17] piscisaureus: but Im working on it
[16:17] piscisaureus: konobi: that sounds sane
[16:17] briznad has joined the channel
[16:17] piscisaureus: but suppose you would want to install a library to be shared between all users
[16:17] BillyBreen has joined the channel
[16:18] piscisaureus: in linux it would be in /lib/node/themodule for as much as I can tell
[16:18] piscisaureus: but where would you want to have it on windows?
[16:18] Aikar: im working on something to compliment npm sort of that isaacs can hopefully use (or plain copy if he wants, id rather see it implemented into npm) for installing modules into a projects folder instead of global libs, and gets rid of all the symlinks
[16:18] Aikar: piscisaureus: in windows if cygwin itll be same place
[16:18] konobi: piscisaureus: how do firefox, etc. do it?
[16:19] Aikar: as for a real windows port, i dunno where it would be. is the windows port running?
[16:19] piscisaureus: konobi: I don't think FF stores anything thats shared between users
[16:19] piscisaureus: Aikar: it works partially
[16:19] konobi: Aikar: piscisaureus is working on a native port... this is just theoretical talk
[16:19] Aikar: ah
[16:20] konobi: piscisaureus: it can do, for addons/extensions, etc.

[16:21] piscisaureus: hmmm..
[16:21] piscisaureus: I'm not excited of the idea creating a lib folder on windows
[16:21] Aikar: or default install to C:/Program Files (x86)?/node.js/bin/node and ../lib/node
[16:21] Aikar: i meant as a base node folder
[16:21] Aikar: user could choose not to use a 'node folder'
[16:22] Aikar: that would likely be the best 'expected' layout
[16:22] konobi: Progam Files/node/{lib,bin,etc,.npm}
[16:22] Aikar: keep the same nix file structure, but with a windows prefix path
[16:22] Aikar: yes
[16:22] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[16:22] Aikar: cept .npm is inside of lib/node
[16:23] Aikar: since thats where node is designed to auto add to paths
[16:23] Aikar: keep it identical to linux but C:/Program Files/node/ instead of /usr/local/
[16:23] c4milo has joined the channel
[16:23] piscisaureus: Aikar. I was thinking of that as well but it still looks like you're trying to the linux bolt on a windows screw
[16:24] Aikar: or id really vote to default it to C:/node/ instead of program files. Spaces are evil and would lower support issues with spaces in file names
[16:24] piscisaureus: maybe c:\program files\node\node.exe and stuff libs in c:\program files\node\lib?
[16:24] Aikar: piscisaureus: nothing wrong with that style, anyone devving for node is going to be familiar with linux style. 
[16:24] Aikar: were not targetting grandma sue here
[16:25] Aikar: we dont have to be super user friendly
[16:25] piscisaureus: Aikar. we do have to be super user friendly!
[16:25] Aikar: take $INSTALLPREFIX/bin/node and add $INSTALLPREFIX/bin to the users PATH
[16:25] konobi: piscisaureus: there's also some way of adding things to PATH
[16:26] aheckmann has joined the channel

[16:30] chapel: does me well
[16:30] pyrotechnic: i think if i cleaned the lense the only probel would be that the wheel slips on the innerwheel
[16:30] Aikar: piscisaureus: modules no, but node adds ../lib/node/ to its require.paths automatically, so keeping same folder structure makes porting easier
[16:30] pyrotechnic: like the rubber slides on the plastic

[16:32] Aikar: such a long path
[16:32] chapel: yeah, surface matters
[16:32] Aikar: piscisaureus: why change it?
[16:32] chapel: pyrotechnic: I was thinking about our db idea (database)
[16:32] pyrotechnic: i think theyre supposed to be used on smooth hard surfaces
[16:32] Aikar: if you just keep same folder structure, all that code is fine
[16:32] pyrotechnic: whereas my desk is quite rough and my mousepad is quite soft
[16:32] pyrotechnic: so it's not nice on either of them
[16:32] pyrotechnic: yeah chapel?
[16:32] chapel: ah, I have a stained wood desk
[16:32] pyrotechnic: wanna pm me
[16:32] pyrotechnic: yeah same but mines taken quite the beating over teh years
[16:32] piscisaureus: Aikar: because I would like node to be in c:\program files\node\node.exe and your solution would imply that libs end up in c:\program files\lib
[16:33] pyrotechnic: about to get new desks and chairs for our office ;)
[16:33] pyrotechnic: check what we're getting
[16:33] piscisaureus: Oh you mean why that code needs to change
[16:33] piscisaureus: well maybe that part can stay, but $HOME is not usable on windows so the module resolution code needs to change
[16:33] Aikar: piscisaureus: why does it need to be program files\node\node.exe? whats wrong with node\bin\node.exe like many other language interpreters (ie Java) do it?
[16:33] konobi: pyrotechnic: just hack something onto the bottom instead?
[16:33] pyrotechnic: yeah i have considered trying to take off the bars and put on proper glider pads
[16:34] pyrotechnic: i do like the 2d scroll, but thats about it
[16:34] pyrotechnic: id rather buttons
[16:34] pyrotechnic: like proper physical buttons
[16:34] pyrotechnic: im becomming quite the fan of tactile feedback again
[16:34] pyrotechnic: especially after using this blackwidow mechanical keyboard
[16:34] Aikar: the user wont really be going into the program files folder and double clicking an exe anyways... the item is simply going to be added to PATH, so having it in a bin folder is harmless
[16:34] piscisaureus: Aikar: seems like java does what you are proposing indeed
[16:34] pyrotechnic: my gf hates it because it's noisy, but it's so nice to type on
[16:35] Aikar: java isnt only one, its a pretty common format for command line based tools to keep it similar to nix path style
[16:36] piscisaureus: Aikar: yeah and it sucks. When you access ~/something from the git shell, do you know where it goes? Certainly different from where it goes when you use cygwin, or mingw, or anything else
[16:36] Aikar: shouldnt it be C:/Users/aikar/ ?
[16:37] piscisaureus: All these apps think they should create their own equivalent to the linux root FS and your stuff ends up scattered everywhere where you don't wnat it
[16:37] piscisaureus: Aikar: that would be great for 'user-specific'  libs, e.g. the equivalent of ~/.node_libraries
[16:38] ph^ has joined the channel
[16:38] Aikar: 'user specific' is already outside of the 'node install path' for linux too
[16:38] Aikar: but were talking about developers here, not grandmas. installing user specific modules to C:/users/user/.node_modules is fine
[16:39] piscisaureus: Yeah. An equivalent for  /lib/node is what troubles me most
[16:39] Aikar: that is the users user folder, accessible by clicking your username on start menu
[16:39] Aikar: the user has the choice on where to install node

[16:55] piscisaureus: running node on cygwin should give you a multibillion fine or captial punishment
[16:56] torvalamo: cygwin can run windows apps
[16:56] torvalamo: that's the difference
[16:56] torvalamo: a huge difference
[16:57] piscisaureus: torvalamo: o yeah? try `start c:\\`  on cygwin :-)
[16:57] amerine has joined the channel
[16:57] torvalamo: not like that
[16:58] torvalamo: you still need to access the right executable
[16:58] piscisaureus: All this crazy path translation that it does breaks a lot of stuff
[17:00] torvalamo: how so? you can still install most the linux utils
[17:00] torvalamo: and access it through bash like normal
[17:00] rsms_ has joined the channel
[17:00] torvalamo: i'm not saying you should, just that you can
[17:01] piscisaureus: yeah. you can
[17:01] torvalamo: i can totally see how windows utils are desirable sometimes
[17:02] piscisaureus: me too. I use msys a lot
[17:02] matjas has joined the channel
[17:02] torvalamo: but then the app would be written with cygwin in mind, so the path translation wouldn't be an issue
[17:02] isaacs has joined the channel
[17:02] torvalamo: know what i mean?
[17:02] piscisaureus: Do we want to tell people that they need to get familiar with msys or linux to be able to use node. I don't like the idea
[17:03] piscisaureus: Ehm
[17:03] piscisaureus: I don't think any app ever was written with cygwin in mind :-)
[17:03] piscisaureus: apart from cygwin itself
[17:03] torvalamo: if the app uses both ms and unix tools for, say, conversion purposes

[17:39] piscisaureus: isaacs: good. do that on the ml
[17:40] micheil: piscisaureus: re: "SF waking up", Australia hasn't slept.
[17:40] piscisaureus: micheil: yeah I have that often :-)
[17:40] isaacs: piscisaureus: headline: instead of figuring out what the module system path should be on windows, let's get rid of the "module system path" concept.
[17:40] tanepiper: tjholowaychuk: cool, i should only need less myself - tbh we don't do much in the way of css in our app, it's all ExtJS's theme stuff
[17:40] tanepiper: this is just for the nice signup and login pages which are standard html
[17:40] tjholowaychuk: tanepiper: fair enough
[17:40] piscisaureus: isaacs: welcome
[17:41] tjholowaychuk: tanepiper: they are all pretty similar though so its easy to contain them in one middleware

[17:41] mjr_ has joined the channel
[17:41] piscisaureus: isaacs: when u are done, can you explain to me what setgid and setuid do. what are the use cases for it? how does it affect child processes and fs operation? Because I need to think about sandboxing on a certain platform as well
[17:42] isaacs: piscisaureus: i think that's the only way that npm is going to work natively on windows.  here's a plan: https://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/doc/future-ideas/new-module-system.md
[17:42] isaacs: piscisaureus: setgid and setuid change the group id or user id of the process.  it's only allowed if you'er root
[17:43] isaacs: piscisaureus: which means, you can only do it once.
[17:43] isaacs: piscisaureus: (since then you're not root afterwards)
[17:43] piscisaureus: okay. that's one thing you can never do on windows :-)
[17:43] isaacs: you can also set a gid/uid on a child process, which runs that child process as the specified user, and requires root access, as well.
[17:44] isaacs: piscisaureus: is there any comparable way to downgrade permissions?  windows does have admin/user/guest, right?
[17:44] isaacs: some kind of levels?

[17:46] lukegalea has joined the channel
[17:47] piscisaureus: isaacs: few things: 
[17:47] piscisaureus: - changing the user is hard. you need to hardcode the password and username. you can't the the user for the current process, even when you are admin (but you could do that for child processes)
[17:47] piscisaureus: - on vista / 7 there is the concept of 'elevated mode'. It's like sudo for windows. You are still the same user but the process gets more privileges.
[17:48] piscisaureus: to effectively run in a sandbox you would need the process to switch to a lower 'integrity level' if you weren't on a low level already

[17:49] piscisaureus: I'm not sure if it is possible to change the level of the current process, but you can do that to child processes for sure

[17:51] aklt: cloudhead: I created a patch to add --xunit to vows, but have some questions... Do you have a minut?
[17:51] piscisaureus: isaacs: no on windows a lot more is possible and the api is like that.
[17:51] piscisaureus: for some fun, look at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa375742%28v=VS.85%29.aspx
[17:51] cloudhead: aklt: sure
[17:51] isaacs: i'd be fine with jsut replacing those functions with a no-op if it's too hard or impossible to do on windows.  ask ry, though
[17:52] isaacs: i'm not sure if it'd be better if process.setuid(7) failed loudly, simply didn't exist, or failed silently.
[17:53] jamesarosen has joined the channel
[17:53] piscisaureus: isaacs: I wouldn't mind, but my almost-employer ...
[17:55] piscisaureus: isaacs: that's why I want to understand what the use case is. If it's just a program thinking 'I'm going to do something dangerous, lets drop some priviledges' or 'I don't trust this to-be child process, run it in a sandbox' we can figure out an api and I know what to support
[17:56] isaacs: yeah, that's basically it
[17:56] isaacs: i'm working on refactoring npm to use that for any scripts that packages run, so that their capacity for malicious/accidental harm is reduced.
[17:57] murz has joined the channel
[17:57] piscisaureus: isaacs: I think the reason that you shouldn't sudo npm on linux applies to windows as well. We need a cross-platform solution for that in the future
[17:58] isaacs: piscisaureus: once this refactor lands, it'll be *better* to sudo npm
[17:58] AAA_awright has joined the channel
[17:58] piscisaureus: much fun
[17:58] isaacs: since the "nobody" user has less privileges than your user account, and i can't switch to nobody if i'm "bert"
[17:58] rachelbutts has joined the channel
[17:59] piscisaureus: ah!
[17:59] isaacs: only root can change their uid
[18:00] piscisaureus: but then we would just need process.impersonateNobody() or process.setTrustLevel('low') to do that in a X-platform way
[18:00] piscisaureus: setuid etc -> move to the os module
[18:01] isaacs: yeah
[18:01] isaacs: that'd be nice
[18:01] isaacs: on *nix systems, it's customary to have a customizable nobody-user for a given program.
[18:01] piscisaureus: like, one for each program?
[18:01] isaacs: so, for instance, all of the things that the Apache process can serve and manage are owned by "www-data"
[18:01] isaacs: sometimes
[18:01] piscisaureus: oh yeah that has bitten me :-)
[18:01] isaacs: mysqld runs as "mysql"
[18:02] isaacs: "nobody" is sort of a catch-all
[18:02] piscisaureus: on windows, normally you run this kind of stuff as a service using 'NetworkService'  and 'LocalService' etc accounds
[18:02] piscisaureus: and to protect folders and files you use ACLs
[18:04] piscisaureus: so you generally don't need file permission bits kind of stuff, it's not even supported

[18:07] piscisaureus: I don't know much about linux, but about Solaris i know Absolutely Nothing® ™
[18:08] piscisaureus: isaacs: I think on windows you can pretty much configure everything per-user as well
[18:09] isaacs: yeah, i don't know much about it either, but i work for a solaris shop, so i have lots of incredibly authoritative experts to ask about these sorts ofthings.
[18:09] isaacs: i personally kind of dig the standard unix way of managing permissions.   it's not featurey, but it's nice and simple, and lets you make things reasonable secure
[18:09] heavysixer has joined the channel
[18:09] isaacs: where it concerns security, more features are usually just more crinkles in the armor.
[18:09] herbySk has joined the channel
[18:09] isaacs: places for things to break or slip through
[18:10] piscisaureus: isaacs: that's true. Room for conceptual error. Plus when it is so complex most admins don't care  to set up anything at all. Or something doesn't work and then they give some user way too many privileges

[18:11] isaacs: yeah

[18:17] isaacs: quite.
[18:17] mnbvasd: haha
[18:17] sechrist: ..solaris? my knee jerk reaction is bsd
[18:18] piscisaureus: faster? 
[18:18] pauls_ has joined the channel
[18:18] isaacs: the virtualization level is a bit higher.
[18:18] mnbvasd: surely that all depends.
[18:18] montylounge has joined the channel
[18:18] isaacs: so, whereas xen virtualizes the hardware, zoneadm virtualizes the OS
[18:18] mnbvasd: isaacs: for zones, over say lxc?
[18:18] sechrist: Oh I see, in the context of VPSes
[18:18] isaacs: that means you can spike and take advantage of un-used CPU and RAM
[18:19] sechrist: Is that comparable to KVM?
[18:19] mnbvasd: zones are more comparable to lxc, or openvz.
[18:19] mnbvasd: or bsd jails.
[18:19] isaacs: but really, i'm not in the hosting business.  my employer is.  i'm in the npm business.
[18:19] isaacs: mnbvasd: yeah, t's comparable to bsd jails
[18:20] isaacs: but with way more management features.
[18:20] isaacs: also: zfs.  holy MOLY zfs.
[18:20] isaacs: it's like the git of file systems.
[18:20] mnbvasd: yeah, zfs gives most people sexual pleasure.
[18:20] isaacs: mnbvasd: never quite heard it put that way, but i think you may be right.
[18:21] jesusabdullah: zfs?
[18:21] mnbvasd: it's like btrfs, but works, now.

[18:58] Nomon: pauls: I have been playing with it for a few days, I have to say I like the 1.0 a lot more than the 0.0.x versions. There are still some bugs and some of them can be quite catastrophic to your data. I also like the new middleware support in it for pre save etc.
[18:58] ryah: mjr_: not large, but throttling in TLS
[18:59] ryah: my task today is to fix that
[18:59] Nomon: pauls: Also a lot less code to write once you get the hang of it.
[18:59] ryah: but yes, there is a known issue.
[18:59] tjholowaychuk: ryah: if you have a WriteStream if you hit it really hard (say 200,000 writes a second) they should eventually flush even if they are slow no?
[18:59] tjholowaychuk: for me they just flat-out fail
[18:59] mjr_: ryah: anyway, great to expose socket.bufferSize.

[19:04] ryah: like 10 minutes to write 1mb of data
[19:04] tjholowaychuk: mjr_: I was just reproducing it with something like 200k writes of n + '\n'

[19:09] micheil: umm.. one sec
[19:10] micheil: https://gist.github.com/797991
[19:10] tjholowaychuk: micheil: would be nice to have a buffering option, defaulting to nothing i guess
[19:10] tjholowaychuk: unless that is what you did
[19:10] tjholowaychuk: lol
[19:10] tjholowaychuk: ill check out the patch
[19:11] mjr_: I did a bunch of tests with different write sizes on Linux, and 4096 bytes seemed to be a sweet spot.
[19:11] ryah: ACTION wonders if he should add a default high-water mark for sockets
[19:11] ryah: and print error messages
[19:11] micheil: mjr_: okay, well, yeah, I just took the number from net.js
[19:11] ryah: ("warning you are queueing up a lot of data")
[19:11] mjr_: Also, I did this test quite a long time ago, so things are probably different now.
[19:12] mjr_: Too bad writev didn't make things any faster.
[19:12] ajcates has joined the channel
[19:12] ryah: writev will be revisited when we do the refactor for iocp
[19:12] Country has joined the channel
[19:13] micheil: isaacs: Okay, I'm going to take the same cache setup from npm future
[19:13] mjr_: It's a bummer that 1 byte fs writes are insanely slow, but for now, users should just not do that.
[19:13] micheil: for deploy
[19:13] tjholowaychuk: mjr_: it was more of surprise to me that they just didnt work haha
[19:13] tjholowaychuk: slowness still sucks but I can deal with it
[19:14] isaacs: micheil: ok
[19:14] mjr_: Yes, failing is really bad.
[19:14] isaacs: micheil: that's actually pretty much the cache setup from npm current.  I didnt' change that aspect of it much.
[19:14] isaacs: just dropped the dot and moved packages into a "packages" folder.
[19:14] isaacs: probably should've done that in the first place, but .cache came later, and i didn't want to change things around.
[19:14] micheil: isaacs: so, it'll load up all the modules into the node_modules path
[19:14] stephank has joined the channel
[19:14] isaacs: but windows hates dot folders

[19:15] micheil: so:
[19:15] micheil: ./deploy.json
[19:15] micheil: ./node_modules
[19:15] micheil: ./package.json
[19:15] isaacs: why do you need the extra json file, again?
[19:15] isaacs: just for the git+path stuff?
[19:16] micheil: it's containing the private modules (git+path)
[19:16] micheil: and it also contains deployment locations and post-deploy/pre-deploy hooks
[19:17] liar has joined the channel
[19:17] micheil: deploy is for getting your code on to your server(s)
[19:17] Coal has joined the channel
[19:17] micheil: isaacs: If foo depends on bar, and bar depends on baz, then there will also be a ./node_modules/foo/node_modules/bar/node_modules/baz, and so on.
[19:18] micheil: watch out with max file-path lengths
[19:18] isaacs: micheil: yes.
[19:18] isaacs: what's the max file-path length?
[19:18] isaacs: (in practice)
[19:18] isaacs: i mean, java gets away with some absurdly long path names.
[19:18] micheil: some os's iirc, have a maximum filename length, although, this also extends down to the absolute paths
[19:18] isaacs: i see.
[19:18] micheil: I think I've hit it a few times, but not often
[19:18] isaacs: so it's not number of path segments, but actual length of the full filename path
[19:19] micheil: yeah
[19:19] isaacs: worth testing.  maybe we could shorten "node_modules" or something.
[19:19] micheil: yeah, if we see that limit being hit
[19:19] isaacs: seems like people prefer using "deps" anyway.
[19:19] micheil: isaacs: is there anything I can do to help?
[19:19] isaacs: just that that's too generic, and it'd be better to use something specific to node.
[19:19] isaacs: micheil: keep thinking up edge cases :)
[19:19] Me1000 has joined the channel
[19:20] micheil: isaacs: nothing code wise?
[19:20] isaacs: micheil: explicitly write out how you think certain features should work.
[19:20] micheil: ACTION would prefer "deps" over node_modules
[19:20] isaacs: not really at teh coding stage yet.
[19:20] micheil: if theres a package.json, it's more then likely for node

[19:20] isaacs: micheil: weeks, maybe.
[19:20] micheil: ryah: I'll have to pull that into votizen/node
[19:21] micheil: isaacs: before NodeConf?
[19:21] isaacs: i dont' really know how to share that kind of core thing very well.
[19:21] isaacs: yeah, definitely pre-nodeconf
[19:21] micheil: good.
[19:21] isaacs: my usual approach for stuff like this in npm is to document the hell out of it, and then write it all in an afternoon or something once the whole image is crystalized in my mind.
[19:21] kris_ has joined the channel
[19:22] isaacs: the coding bit is usually not hte hard part. you start the coding when the hard part is done.
[19:22] micheil: isaacs: okay, well, deploy depends on npm; so, yeah.
[19:22] isaacs: i'll definitely be in constant communication about it :)
[19:22] isaacs: very very soon (once securify lands) i'm going to fork npm, and only do bugfixes on the current implementation, and then go nuts on this new thing
[19:22] deepthawtz has joined the channel
[19:23] micheil: securify?
[19:23] kris_: is there a quote/escape function-- use case escaping part of a command (input filename) that will be run with exec
[19:23] isaacs: kris_: i usually just do child_process.spawn("sh", ["-c", theCommand])
[19:24] isaacs: micheil: securify is the branch where i'm making sudo ok
[19:24] micheil: ah
[19:24] micheil: okay
[19:24] isaacs: right now it works if you use sudo for everything, and fails if you don't.
[19:24] micheil: once again, let me know if there's anything I can do to help.
[19:24] isaacs: i am working on making it work if you're not sudo, for things that shouldnt' require sudo, or if the relevant folders aren't root-owned.
[19:25] lumino has joined the channel
[19:25] isaacs: you shouldn't have to use sudo for `npm ls`, for instance
[19:25] isaacs: but since the .cache folder is root-owned, you kinda do.
[19:26] micheil: "When doing a localized installation, executables are linked (or, on windows, shimmed) to ./node_modules/.bin"

[19:33] micheil: (this is for the new doctool for node.js)
[19:33] tjholowaychuk: micheil: well dox doesnt even count
[19:33] tjholowaychuk: its just a stupid hack
[19:33] micheil: k
[19:34] tjholowaychuk: but all of mine are pretty typical recursive descent parsers
[19:34] tjholowaychuk: with the exception of stylus
[19:34] tjholowaychuk: which is a crazy contextual beast
[19:34] micheil: explain?
[19:34] tjholowaychuk: of crazyness

[20:05] tjholowaychuk: but faster is good
[20:05] mAritz: omfg... tjholowaychuk: do you remember the weird haml problem i had 2 days ago? i fixed it by breaking the indentation in a way it's not supposed to work :D

[20:08] tjholowaychuk: sveimac: they are lexically scoped, but the root-level ones are yup
[20:09] sveimac: tjholowaychuk: then I could probably just keep it all in memory and only recompile the file thats changed, will make the watch-recompile process fast when working with large projects
[20:10] Fuld: Something like Rails Authentication is what node needs
[20:10] tjholowaychuk: sveimac: when im working on a stylesheet I just do `watch --interval=1 stylus < foo > bar` right now
[20:10] sveimac: my current project has 50 files :S, and compass/sass takes 5 -8 seconds to compile atm (alpha)

[20:48] pyrotechnick: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.3.7/api/events.html#emitter.setMaxListeners
[20:48] pyrotechnick: By default EventEmitters will print a warning if more than 10 listeners are added to it. This is a useful default which helps finding memory leaks. Obviously not all Emitters should be limited to 10. This function allows that to be increased. Set to zero for unlimited.

[21:50] severla has joined the channel
[21:51] jimt has joined the channel
[21:51] ryah: we definitely need to separate "executables" from "modules"
[21:51] isaacs: ryah: why?
[21:51] killfill: how do i go to c: with mingw
[21:51] ryah: they are not the same thing, and i don't like "modules" shipping iwth "executables"
[21:51] ryah: they are different things
[21:51] severla: hi, may someone tell me what   args.This()   means? what does that contain? of course, within v8
[21:52] isaacs: ryah: well, yeah, but they're often extremely tightly coupled, and a lot of times an executable has a lot of library bits that others can benefit from using.
[21:52] isaacs: qv npm
[21:52] ryah: we need to adjust people's expectations
[21:52] isaacs: or are you suggesting that we split the npm-lib off from npm-bin?
[21:52] ryah: something like that
[21:52] mikeal: ryah, isaacs: example, couchapp ships with a command line tool for syncing, but your also need to require('couchapp') in the module you wish to push
[21:52] piscisaureus: killfill: cd /c
[21:52] isaacs: yeah, exactly
[21:52] kepheus has left the channel
[21:53] isaacs: you can call htem "different things", but it's sort of an arbitrary place to draw the line.
[21:53] mikeal: i would call it a "package" rather than a module vs executable
[21:53] isaacs: it's just different api's around the same bit of functionality, usually.
[21:53] dekz has joined the channel
[21:53] isaacs: mikeal: i think ry wants to install "modules" without installing "packages"
[21:53] ryah: the "module" installer should not have anythign to do with my $PATH
[21:54] mikeal: so
[21:54] mikeal: i think "installing" a package
[21:54] mikeal: module, executable, whatver
[21:54] mikeal: should shove it somewhere locally
[21:54] isaacs: ryah: well, sure, and you'll be able to get that functionality just fine.  your use case is satisfied.  now we're working on satisfying the other use cases.
[21:54] ryah: the "executable installer", which i won't use - but homebrew user's will need, can drop stuff into /usr/bin
[21:54] mikeal: and "using" that module in a particular package can copy it from where it was installed locally
[21:54] dw_ has joined the channel
[21:54] deepthawtz has joined the channel
[21:54] mikeal: like, if i want to get on a plane and start a new project
[21:55] mikeal: i should be able to easily use all the packages I have locally
[21:55] mikeal: but not like, via sym links or global paths
[21:55] mikeal: it just keeps a cache
[21:55] ryah: i'm fine with modules shipping with .sh files - but the module installer should not attempt to link them into my path
[21:55] ryah: nor have code to do it
[21:55] AAA_awright: Seperation of executables from Javascript libraries (CommonJS modules)
[21:55] mikeal: and that same "install" process can install executables when relevant
[21:56] mikeal: ryah: it's useless if it doesn't
[21:56] mikeal: you should be able to install a module without installing executables, optionally
[21:56] ajcates has joined the channel
[21:56] ryah: only.
[21:56] AAA_awright: I'm assuming "module" means CommonJS modules and Node.js compiled libraries
[21:56] mikeal: but the installer should be usable as a "bin" installer
[21:56] isaacs: ryah: why?
[21:56] isaacs: i mean, what is gained by not having that functionality?
[21:56] ryah: an extra tool can link it into my path
[21:56] isaacs: that's *easy*
[21:56] isaacs: and without it, a lot of things are more difficult to do
[21:56] mikeal: what extra tool?
[21:57] mikeal: npm is already an extra tool :)
[21:57] isaacs: mikeal: ryah wants two tools.
[21:57] ryah: mikeal: apt.js
[21:57] isaacs: one to install modules, and another to install programs.
[21:57] mikeal: oh i see
[21:57] mikeal: here is the problem
[21:57] isaacs: and that's fine, but just saying, "ok, you can't easily deploy node cli programs any more" is not acceptable.
[21:57] lukegalea_ has joined the channel
[21:57] mikeal: when you're developing that tool
[21:57] brapse has joined the channel
[21:57] isaacs: "hold on, we've got another tool coming, eventually, which will put back that functionality we've all grown to depend on"
[21:57] AAA_awright: Any other package manager has libraries/modules and executables in the same type of package
[21:58] mikeal: you need the development link system to apply both to modules and to executables
[21:58] isaacs: it's almost the same exact task, too
[21:58] ryah: we're conflating two ideas: installing a program that im a user of, and installing a module that i'm going to hook into my process
[21:58] isaacs: it just makes sense to have one program that does it
[21:58] isaacs: ryah: no, they're the same idea.
[21:58] mikeal: ryah: here's the thing, and let me finish explaining
[21:58] isaacs: ryah: in both cases, you're "installing a program that i'm a user of" it's just that in the second, you're using the program programmatically
[21:58] mikeal: npm is only going to install executables that are used by developers
[21:58] isaacs: ACTION hands mikeal his talking stick...
[21:59] mikeal: it's not installing end user stuff
[21:59] mikeal: end users are going to use apt-get
[21:59] mikeal: or they will homebrew
[21:59] mikeal: and homebrew will install a big ass bundle package
[21:59] mikeal: that was prebuilt for that package manager
[21:59] mikeal: the excutables npm installs are for developers, and that's why the integration with their existing npm package manger is importnat
[22:00] AAA_awright: Well, then you have to work around package managers. Getting a package for Ubuntu fixed/corrected is insane.
[22:00] isaacs: mikeal: i'd argue that that's a very fuzzy boundary you just drew there.
[22:00] Nomon: A bit like php does with pecl and pear I guess?
[22:00] mikeal: so, i built a python package for semi-normal people
[22:00] ryah: i don't care that it's hard for tjholowaychuk to ship his css-transformation-script into everyone's PATH. this is not the problem we're setting out to solve.
[22:00] mikeal: basically software testers who are not developers
[22:00] tjholowaychuk: woah?
[22:00] tjholowaychuk: what?
[22:00] ryah: distributing software is hard
[22:01] isaacs: ryah: i care about that.  i want to play with his css-transofrmation-script, and i don't want to dick around with a bunch of crap manually to do that.
[22:01] mikeal: and they could not install it with regular packaging tools, it had to be an apt-get packager
[22:01] ryah: then that can be a different tool
[22:01] tjholowaychuk: bins are not installing?
[22:01] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: discussing the future.  don't be alarmed :)
[22:01] mikeal: tjholowaychuk: this is future talk
[22:01] tjholowaychuk: oh haha ok
[22:02] mikeal: ryah: it already is a different tool, it's called apt-get and homebrew
[22:02] tjholowaychuk: I think its important to install the executables if that is what this is about
[22:02] severla: Hi, I'm working on bindings for Node; been studying different bindings code; would like to understand what's in args.This() within v8
[22:02] isaacs: mikeal, ryah: in the https://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/doc/future-ideas/new-module-system.md spec, i think this is adequately handled to everyone's liking.
[22:02] tanepiper: The #node.js debate team
[22:02] mikeal: but when you're a node developer using npm you want integration
[22:02] tanepiper: GO TEAM!
[22:02] ryah: you guys hate simplicity
[22:02] AAA_awright: No I just like semantics
[22:03] isaacs: ryah: no one hates simplicity.
[22:03] tjholowaychuk: simplicity is nice, but being useless is not so nice
[22:03] isaacs: ryah: but i don't think that having to do things manually is simpler than having a tool that does them in a predictable way.
[22:03] Nomon: More tools != simplicity
[22:03] ryah: ^-- thank you
[22:03] ryah: isaacs: do you use eclipse?
[22:03] isaacs: Nomon: depends on what your tools do, and how good a typist you are.
[22:03] tanepiper: isaacs: so what i get from this is npm won't be a distribution tool anymore for apps, but just for libs
[22:04] isaacs: ryah: no.  i use vim.
[22:04] JoeB_ has joined the channel
[22:04] isaacs: tanepiper: no, it'll be for everything still.
[22:04] ryah: but eclipse provides many menu items that do things in predictable ways
[22:04] ryah: like generate massive xml files
[22:04] isaacs: i'm not going to remove bin support, because i use it, a lot, and npm is for me.
[22:04] ryah: it makes it easy
[22:04] AAA_awright: Simplicity isn't the highest good here, it's usability, simplicity necessary for usability but it's not the end-all be-all requirement
[22:04] AAA_awright: *is necessary
[22:04] isaacs: ryah: come on, you know that's a silly comparison.  those xml files have more lines than npm's whole codebase.
[22:04] mikeal: isaacs: in your spec, i don't understand the new "global" install
[22:05] ryah: i'm just saying - less tools = better almost always
[22:05] isaacs: ryah: do you write code with ed?
[22:05] isaacs: or vi?
[22:05] ryah: i choose my tools carefully
[22:05] mikeal: ryah: if people don't want to use npm to install their executables they'll just do a bundle package and push it to apt
[22:06] ryah: i like the module repository, i like being able to get socket.io and its dependencies easily
[22:06] ryah: i want those tools
[22:06] isaacs: ok
[22:06] AAA_awright: Would you like to see all the various package managers consolidated into one, let's say there's a package manager where you could add-on Node.js package semanics so now you can use your OS package manager to install libs and executables and whatnot
[22:06] isaacs: so, in the new version of npm, it'll be easy to do just that if you want, and the end result will be that you'll have it how you like it.
[22:06] AAA_awright: That's certainly simpler and more usable, I would argue, but right now it isn't very economical with the package hell Linux distros have
[22:07] Nomon: isaacs: I do not see it simplify a process having separate tools to install libs and bins vs having 1 tool do them both at the cost of getting a binary or two in your PATH you might never use. I am all for fine grain controll and options to do specific tasks/parts of a process in a tool
[22:07] mikeal: the commonjs guys hate the module repostiory
[22:07] mikeal: they think you should refer to a web API end point in your package.json
[22:07] mikeal: it's totally unusable
[22:07] ryah: i also like forcing my way of doing things on others
[22:07] mikeal: but it's the same logic as not installing executables
[22:07] JoeB_: Hello, I am having a problem installing on W7, can anyone help with resolution of build error

[22:07] markwubben has joined the channel
[22:08] ryah: like forcing people to not use blocking i/o
[22:08] isaacs: ryah: npm config set binroot false ; npm config set global false
[22:08] isaacs: ryah: and then npm will behave how you're wanting it to.
[22:08] mikeal: there we go
[22:08] ryah: default
[22:08] devrim has joined the channel
[22:08] mikeal: hahaha
[22:08] isaacs: ryah: no.  the defautl configs in npm will be the ones that i like.
[22:08] mikeal: ryah isn't happy with an option specifically made just for him
[22:08] mikeal: it MUST BE DEFAULT
[22:08] ncb000gt: lol
[22:08] mikeal: ryah: isaacs also likes forcing his way on to other people :)
[22:09] mikeal: npm style guide FTW!
[22:09] isaacs: i like forcing flexibility on the unflexible.

[22:09] JoeB_: I get a build err#2  libv8.a
[22:09] isaacs: JoeB_: cygwin?
[22:09] JoeB_: yes
[22:09] isaacs: JoeB_: what version of node are you trying to build?  0.3.7 does not build properly.
[22:10] JoeB_: which should i use
[22:10] isaacs: JoeB_: try `git checkout v0.3.6` and then ./configure && make clean install
[22:10] JoeB_: thanks
[22:10] isaacs: or download the 0.3.6 code
[22:10] isaacs: np
[22:10] jimt_ has joined the channel
[22:10] ryah: you guys haven't thought about modules enough. you'll come around.
[22:10] isaacs: ryah: i think this plan is good.
[22:11] severla: please anyone explain me what's in v8::Arguments::This :(
[22:11] mikeal: i think we're all in agreement now about modules
[22:11] Poetro has joined the channel
[22:11] isaacs: ryah: i still am not completely sure about the "squishing the path" stuff, have to flesh out with more use cases.
[22:11] mikeal: just not executables :)
[22:11] isaacs: ryah: but that's an implementation detail
[22:11] AAA_awright: I see everyone thinking about packages and build systems the same old way, "what to do to each resource" instead of "what each resource does"
[22:11] AAA_awright: "what to do to *with each resource" instead of "what each resource does"
[22:12] ryah: isaacs: i think it's an improvement on a system that is already superior to other similar systems.
[22:12] isaacs: i think it's unanimous, though: no NODE_PATH, no require.paths, search in ./node_modules, ../node_modules ../../node_moduoes, ...
[22:12] isaacs: ryah: thanks :)
[22:12] AAA_awright: isaacs: Wait what? Absolutely not
[22:12] isaacs: ryah: it owes a lot to your influence.
[22:12] isaacs: AAA_awright: yes.  it has been Decided by The Decider.
[22:12] Nomon: so its like CPAN style vs gem style :D 
[22:13] mscdex: severla: "The value you get when calling 'This()' is what would have been bound to 
[22:13] mscdex: 'this' if the function had been an ordinary javascript function."
[22:13] AAA_awright: isaacs: The parent directory searching isn't a bad idea, but elimination of the search path... That's a pretty core OS concept, of the search path
[22:13] piscisaureus: isaacs: actually I like require.paths 
[22:13] ryah: isaacs: squishing the path is what i expected to happen last time i did npm bundle install
[22:14] mikeal: i'm even skeptical about working your way up the tree
[22:14] ryah: isaacs: which, btw i couldn't use because i didn't want to store npm metadata in my repo
[22:14] davidascher has joined the channel
[22:14] isaacs: ryah: yeah, bundle is kinda shit.
[22:14] mikeal: just ./node_modules
[22:14] AAA_awright: I would end up symlinking .node_modules to whatever system directory
[22:14] AAA_awright: Is that the idea there?
[22:15] danoyoung has joined the channel
[22:15] isaacs: it has some good aspects, but it's time to fold those in.
[22:15] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: i like bundle, i just splice the require.paths to only include my node_modules
[22:15] ryah: socket.io-node has a large dependency that it uses just for testing. i wonder if we could mark up dependencies as optional
[22:15] tjholowaychuk: conceptually it makes more sense than global stuff IMO
[22:15] jimt has joined the channel
[22:15] isaacs: mikeal: the reason for walking up the path is that it allows cyclic dependencies, nested packages, etc.
[22:15] tjholowaychuk: ryah: development deps should not even be in package.json really
[22:15] isaacs: ryah: testing things should be in devDependencies, not in dependencies
[22:15] mikeal: fuckin cyclic deps
[22:15] tjholowaychuk: subomdules are fine for that
[22:15] mikeal: they make everything harder
[22:15] ryah: tjholowaychuk++
[22:15] v8bot:  ryah has given a beer to tjholowaychuk. tjholowaychuk now has 8 beers.
[22:15] isaacs: mikeal: they are real, and they become painful eventually.
[22:16] mikeal: fuck submodules
[22:16] mikeal: i hate submodules, more than anything in the world
[22:16] AAA_awright: The PATH variable is great because individual users and even programs can append onto it, it's the very core of how I manage my Gentoo system, what would you do in replacement?
[22:16] isaacs: acutally, fuck packages.
[22:16] tjholowaychuk: mikeal :D
[22:16] isaacs: just put code in your file.
[22:16] ryah: not ++ to submodules, to the idea that dev deps are not in package.json
[22:16] isaacs: fuck require()
[22:16] mikeal: who wants to depend on the master of some package
[22:16] mikeal: that's terrible
[22:16] isaacs: copy and paste.
[22:16] mikeal: everyone has a different version
[22:16] isaacs: you wanna provide a lib?  use gist.github.com
[22:16] isaacs: we're javascripters, right?
[22:16] isaacs: concat that shit.
[22:16] mikeal: because they updated their submodules at different times
[22:17] tjholowaychuk: am I the only one that doesnt have issues with submods lol
[22:17] ajcates has joined the channel
[22:17] mikeal: write code that works with a dep, lock that deps code in locally and check it in
[22:17] AAA_awright: isaacs: require() is what makes Node.js better than anything else, I mean, "import" seriously? How many languages use some sort of import syntax and namespace horrors
[22:17] ncb000gt: isaacs: +1
[22:17] isaacs: AAA_awright: ok, let's get rid of import() too
[22:17] isaacs: copy and paste.
[22:17] mikeal: tjholowaychuk: you may not personally, but everyone you're collaborating with now *may* have differing versions
[22:17] isaacs: javascript has closures.  use those if you want to limit scope.
[22:17] tjholowaychuk: mikeal: if they dont update yeah
[22:17] tjholowaychuk: i think they should update automatically
[22:17] isaacs: breaking code into multiple files just makes it more complicated
[22:17] mikeal: again, why are you running master of a dep package instead of a release?
[22:17] aconran_ has joined the channel
[22:17] isaacs: ACTION is being facetious and silly, don't take him seriously.
[22:18] mikeal: no, they shouldn't update automatically
[22:18] tjholowaychuk: mikeal: because they are all mine
[22:18] AAA_awright: I was getting worried there, isaacs
[22:18] mikeal: that just means that yo break whenever the package breaks
[22:18] tjholowaychuk: I know where they are at
[22:18] mikeal: most people don't write all their dependencies 
[22:18] isaacs: mikeal: so, seriously, take a look at https://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/doc/future-ideas/new-module-system.md
[22:18] mikeal: i did
[22:18] tjholowaychuk: and your submod can be any sha.. so i dont think that is an issue really
[22:18] mikeal: i don't understand the globals section
[22:18] isaacs: mikeal: there are some use cases that i mention in there that would be unpossible without walking up the path.
[22:18] tjholowaychuk: i dunno, pointless argument, works fine for me
[22:19] mikeal: walking the path i get now
[22:19] mikeal: cyclic deps, grrr
[22:19] isaacs: mikeal: the global path /usr/local/lib/npm/or/whatever, would be a place to store package metadata and install things outside of a project dir.
[22:19] tim_smart: Git fake submodules <3
[22:19] darvvin has joined the channel
[22:19] tjholowaychuk: tim_smart: agreed :)
[22:20] isaacs: mikeal: yeah, we can probably optimize the lookup somewhat, but that'll be an implementation detail.  effectively, it'll walk up "forever"
[22:20] mikeal: can you keep a cache there so that i can install those packages in to new projects without having a network?
[22:20] tim_smart: Then you just git checkout whatever
[22:20] mikeal: i like fake submodules
[22:20] mikeal: they make way more sense
[22:20] isaacs: mikeal: let's say you install json-command, which drops a cli program into binroot/json
[22:20] mikeal: but i don't like relying on git magic for packaging
[22:20] mikeal: or for deployment
[22:21] isaacs: mikeal: you probably don't want json-command installed in some package folder.  it's a program.  you want to install it so that you can use it anywhere.
[22:21] mikeal: right
[22:21] tim_smart: git fake submodules just appear as static files in a repo.
[22:21] mikeal: but nothing in there is global for require(), right?
[22:21] gggg has joined the channel
[22:21] isaacs: so, --global is for installing stuff that you use in your terminal, and --local is for stuff that you require() or use in your app (like spark2's bin, for instance)
[22:21] isaacs: mikeal: right
[22:21] isaacs: require() won't look there.
[22:21] mikeal: technoweenie told me last night that someone did a 200meg commit message and pushed to github
[22:22] mape: ryah: Am I remembering correctly that there is somekinda standard IPC thingy for node being worked on?

[22:22] ryah: slowly
[22:23] mikeal: i think i have Ryan on tape saying that 0.4 would be out at the beginning on January :)
[22:23] mape: Won't be done for 0.4.0 then?
[22:23] mape: mikeal: or late feb :)
[22:23] tim_smart: mikeal: "Or end of February"
[22:23] ryah: 0.4 will be done next week
[22:23] mape: Neat
[22:23] tim_smart: 'next' is a subjective word.
[22:23] aklt: Cool!
[22:23] tim_smart: :p
[22:23] ryah: the ipc thing won't be included in node, probably
[22:24] mikeal: really?
[22:24] mikeal: i thought it was going to be in core
[22:24] ryah: still debating
[22:24] liquidproof: what's ipc
[22:24] mape: ryah: So what is perks with the IPC you are developing? Just quick and handy? Or a lot of fancy features?
[22:24] tim_smart: What happened about node webworkers? Is pgriess still maintaining it?
[22:24] ryah: inter process communication

[22:25] ryah: mape: fancy features

[22:26] mape: Fancy features like syncinc state or have any examples?
[22:26] ryah: sure
[22:26] CrazyGoogle: tnx :d

[22:27] ryah: htere is a https bug
[22:27] ryah: the debugger could use some work too
[22:27] isaacs: So, if the only major point of contention about the new npm approach is where/if it puts executables, then i think that's pretty rad.
[22:28] mape: ryah: Well, looking forward to taking a look at it :) My current project really could use some need system for keeping processes in sync
[22:28] CrazyGoogle: it would be great release anyway
[22:28] ryah: isaacs: well - that's my major point of contention
[22:28] ryah: isaacs: you should probably open a thread on the ML at some point
[22:28] isaacs: ryah: i'm going to.
[22:28] isaacs: like i said, there's another few use scenarios that i thought of this morning and i'm not sure how it'd handle them.

[22:29] AAA_awright: isaacs: I showed you this but I was wondering if you had any other thoughts, a build system+package manager that does things based on what the package does, instead of what the package manager/build system is told to do. For instance, simply saying "This file is C source that builds a user-level executable, and uses (these) libraries, etc" and it could build the executable, put it in a package maybe (with those semantics attached), or 
[22:29] AAA_awright: install it to the system (where the user has defined user-level binaries to go, probably /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin, maybe /opt/(package)/bin)

[22:32] piscisaureus: isaacs: "Ok, this is where npm lives, I guess." is the right approach I guess
[22:33] piscisaureus: It is far more commong to have data files in a binaries folder than vice versa
[22:33] piscisaureus: $programData is a no go area for real binaries (.exe files)
[22:34] isaacs: piscisaureus: ok.
[22:34] isaacs: piscisaureus: so, if you put npm in ~/my-node-stuff/npm/ let's say, you'd have ~/my-node-stuff/npm/{stuff}
[22:35] clarkfischer: What's the best way to run a script in detached mode?

[22:35] isaacs: clarkfischer: nohup node my-script.js

[22:59] mikeal: but it might be a better fit at JSConf

[23:09] pauls: would have to defer to the experts on that one
[23:09] isaacs: mikeal: so, another thing i forgot to mention, the global location is important for doing `npm link`.
[23:09] isaacs: mikeal: basically, link will be a two-stage thing.  the first links it into the globlal location, and then the second links it into the project that uses it
[23:10] mikeal: right
