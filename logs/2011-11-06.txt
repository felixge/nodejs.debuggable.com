[00:01] AvianFlu has joined the channel
[00:01] benvie: and some version of VC++
[00:01] funktronic: i'm looking at docs and i am wondering why the assumption is made that the alternative to event loops is a thread/connection 
[00:03] fella: Hey, I am trying to install node.js 0.4.8 and as soon as I get to the ./configure step I get "/cygdrive/c/temp/ttbots/node/wscript:232: error: could not configure a cxx compiler!" what can I do?
[00:03] funktronic: fella: you need the compiter.
[00:03] fella: how do I get that?
[00:03] fella: I have Windows 7
[00:03] fella: and Cygwin
[00:04] benvie: I recommend you get node 0.6 and dispense with Cygwin
[00:04] fella: I'll try that.
[00:04] benvie: unless you specifically need to use cygwin for some reason
[00:04] benvie: you can get node.exe for windows, native, nothing special needed
[00:04] benvie: just runs
[00:05] fella: Is there an executable for v0.4.12?
[00:05] mynyml has joined the channel
[00:05] funktronic has left the channel
[00:06] blueadept: hey anyone getting a Segmentation fault if they just enter node command line?
[00:07] blueadept: using v0.6 here, when i just enter node, then type anything i get a set fault
[00:07] blueadept: seg*
[00:07] benvie: node for native windows didn't come around until after 0.5.x
[00:08] fella: no wonder... I'd messed the whole thing up in the first place!
[00:09] benvie: aye the cygwin node was always kind of touchy as it is
[00:09] benvie: and support for it was dropped before 0.6
[00:09] fella: So... will https://github.com/alaingilbert/Turntable-API work with node 5.0.4?
[00:10] fella: It says that it will work with 0.4.8 but not 5.0.8
[00:10] benvie: not sure but I would guess if it's not working with 0.6 it will soon
[00:10] benvie: because that's the new stable version, just came out
[00:10] CrisO has joined the channel
[00:11] benvie: and that repo has been updated within the last few hours so the guy is apparently working on it
[00:11] CrisO has left the channel
[00:11] fella: Has the 0.6 update been pushed to github yet?
[00:11] benvie: node does even/odd stable/unstable releases
[00:11] benvie: so a lot of stuff wasn't updated for 0.5.x due to it being the unstable branch
[00:11] devaholic has joined the channel
[00:12] benvie: and now that 0.6 is out a lot of stuff is being rapidfire updated
[00:12] benvie: yeah 0.6.0 was released within the last day

[00:13] sirdancealot has joined the channel

[00:14] benvie: http://nodejs.org/dist/latest/
[00:14] benvie: for the binary
[00:14] teadict: http://nodejs.org/dist/latest/
[00:14] teadict: oh
[00:14] JakeSays: benvie: python for what?
[00:14] Aria: To build it.
[00:15] Aria: If you have some magical build system that doesn't have hairy dependencies, actually works, and can build V8 too, and doesn't suck in some new and unknown way, speak up.
[00:15] benvie: aye python and vc++ are the build requirements on windows
[00:15] benvie: I think that's it
[00:15] JakeSays: oh. for gyp. right. i build chromium so i already have the deps
[00:15] benvie: if you build chromium then you're good to go
[00:15] benvie: that's way more a pain in the ass
[00:16] Aria: Yeah.
[00:16] JakeSays: to build chromium? nah. piece of cake.
[00:16] JakeSays: i build it weekly.
[00:16] benvie: well comparatively. I mean node is insanely easy to build
[00:16] killfill has joined the channel
[00:16] JakeSays: yes. true.
[00:17] benvie: in that it magically just seems to work for me without fail. Not so with chromium although not an issue now that I have my shit set up
[00:17] benvie: just took a bit of doing to get there
[00:17] fella: Now I'm stuck. I can't seem to install https://github.com/alaingilbert/Turntable-API (I am used to Cygwin---you can call me a fail)
[00:17] JakeSays: hmm. i wonder how hard it'd be to create a Canvas module based on skia instead of cairo
[00:18] benvie: not sure what layer chromium uses in between the two and how tightly woven it is, but I'd guess you'd want whatever that is to do the work for you if you can extract it
[00:18] kersny has joined the channel
[00:18] fella: never mind. got it!

[00:19] jaequery has joined the channel
[00:19] JakeSays: yeah
[00:20] benvie: but there may be some thinner wrapper for canvas or something that's easier to get at
[00:20] isaacs: SubStack: hey
[00:20] isaacs: SubStack: what don't you like about the engines field?
[00:21] TheJH: isaacs, ah, you're here - did you allow node 0.6 yet?
[00:21] isaacs: yeah
[00:21] TheJH: :)
[00:21] benvie: I'd been playing around with chromium embedded frame as a module for node for cross platform gui, so have gotten relatively intimate with the chromium source tree
[00:22] isaacs: i AM thinking about some sort of special-case where "node": "0.5" is shoehorned into "0.5 || 0.6"
[00:22] isaacs: but that's really kind of a weird idea

[00:27] jesusabdullah: <_<;

[00:32] swaj: oh yay, thanks isaacs... thanks also for updating npm :P  I had to hack the package.json earlier
[00:32] isaacs: jesusabdullah: regarding your three suggestions: 1) totally fine.  "node":"*" is acceptable, as is just omitting it.  Like most package.json fields, it's optional.  2) problematic.  can easily result in versions of packages that don't and can never work together properly.  3) nave, nvm, n, etc.
[00:32] akihito_s has joined the channel
[00:32] coreb: when I npm install something, why isn't it added as a dep in package.json?
[00:32] isaacs: coreb: --save or -S
[00:32] isaacs: coreb: -S is shorthand for --save
[00:33] isaacs: coreb: install with --dev --save to save to devDependencies instead
[00:33] isaacs: jesusabdullah: i think perhaps the problem is that the default in npm init is too restrictive.
[00:33] isaacs: jesusabdullah: maybe it'd be better to just not have one, or use >= instead of ~
[00:34] tcurdt has joined the channel
[00:34] coreb: isaacs: great, could've thought you wrote it yourself ;)
[00:34] isaacs: coreb: :)
[00:35] JakeSays: out of curiosity what is npm?
[00:35] coreb: node package manager
[00:35] JakeSays: ah
[00:35] coreb: like apt-get for node.js
[00:35] coreb: or yum if you please
[00:35] isaacs: more like bundler or cpan or pear
[00:35] isaacs: but yeah
[00:36] isaacs: it has some yummy apt qualities as well.
[00:36] jesusabdullah: isaacs: I think that would go a long way
[00:36] Aria: And yet deliciously different.
[00:37] jesusabdullah: I did not like rubygems when I tried it
[00:37] jesusabdullah: everything seemed really broken
[00:38] coreb: pip for python is ok
[00:38] coreb: easy_install has no remove :s
[00:38] killfill has joined the channel
[00:38] isaacs: coreb: i always felt like easy_install makes a promise it can't really keep.
[00:38] Aria: rubygems is horribly broken
[00:38] Aria: Anything that needs that much runtime support is doing it wrong.
[00:38] devongovett has joined the channel
[00:38] isaacs: Aria: what do you mean by "runtime support?"
[00:39] isaacs: Aria: i mean, we did basically rewrite node's module system to support npm's needs ;)
[00:39] Aria: Rubygems has the 'gem' command, and the whole concept of 'activation'
[00:39] Aria: er, not command, but method.
[00:39] isaacs: yeah, it's npm 0.x style
[00:39] Aria: It's not conceptually light. At ALL.
[00:39] isaacs: but you have to require 'rubygems'
[00:39] Aria: Yeah.
[00:39] Aria: They didn't even TRY.
[00:39] Aria: And then bundler takes that and adds more runtime code to override THAT.
[00:40] isaacs: the best car in the world won't get you where you want to go if you point it in the wrong direction.
[00:40] Aria: Yeah.
[00:40] Aria: So now you need to understand ruby's original require, gems and their quirks, AND bundler's hacks.
[00:40] jesusabdullah: Aria: 
[00:40] jesusabdullah: That's what I suspected
[00:40] jesusabdullah: blegh
[00:41] jesusabdullah: pip does its job from the userside
[00:41] Aria: Where npm? It's got such lovely simple rules, and as long as you're not needing things like library A's copy of foo and library B's copy of foo to share objects, it works great.
[00:41] jesusabdullah: but bundling could be better
[00:41] SubStack: isaacs: engines are annoying because they aren't libraries but the semver strings look the same
[00:41] Aria: And even then, only some libraries will be insane, and Javascript lends itself so well to making plain old data objects the norm, it's not a problem in practice.
[00:41] dgathright has joined the channel
[00:41] SubStack: so people tend to needlessly break packages by being overly narrow
[00:42] isaacs: SubStack: yeah, i hear that.
[00:42] tilgovi has joined the channel
[00:42] tilgovi has joined the channel
[00:42] SubStack: and I don't see any way with npm to tell it "fuck you install it anyways"
[00:42] jesusabdullah: It *should* use semvers
[00:42] isaacs: SubStack: no, you have to give npm a version to pretend to be.
[00:42] jesusabdullah: that's what they're for
[00:42] boltR has joined the channel
[00:42] isaacs: SubStack: and the fact that they're semvers, i mean, that's just a version vector.  it's a good pattern.
[00:42] jesusabdullah: agree
[00:42] isaacs: SubStack: maybe npm init should just not provide a default.
[00:42] isaacs: i mean, node's api isn't changing THAT fast, right?
[00:42] SubStack: could you make --force just pretend to be the upper bound?
[00:43] esundahl_ has joined the channel
[00:43] isaacs: SubStack: ok, so, let's say you have two libs, A and B.  Both have a variety of versions available, which work with a variety of deps, and a variety of node versions.
[00:43] jon__ has joined the channel
[00:43] SubStack: or just disable the engine check entirely
[00:43] isaacs: if A@latest works with node@latest, but b@latest doesn't, then you could easily end up in a situation where you have two things that can't work together
[00:43] SubStack: or turn it into a warning
[00:44] jon__: How do I install npm into node 0.6.0 in Windows?
[00:44] Aria: Warnings ++ with force.
[00:44] isaacs: engine is the third dimension of dependency hell
[00:44] SubStack: but you can just as easily run into false positive territory
[00:44] boltR has joined the channel
[00:44] SubStack: in fact that seems to be far more common than a false negative
[00:44] paul__ has joined the channel
[00:44] isaacs: i think making init default to using >= rather than ~ would solve your issue.
[00:44] SubStack: we learn about it whenever the node minor gets bumped
[00:44] jon2: How do I install npm into node 0.6.0 in Windows?
[00:44] coreb: jon2: download the exe-file?
[00:45] SubStack: isaacs: but people still do things like 0.4.x themselves
[00:45] jesusabdullah: npm on windows has an exe now?
[00:45] isaacs: jon2: follow the instructions here: http://npmjs.org/doc/README.html#Installing-on-Windows-Experimental
[00:45] Aria: >= ++
[00:45] isaacs: SubStack: if your thing uses require.paths, then you *should* do that
[00:45] jesusabdullah: SubStack: Then that's their perogative. I think changing the default would go a long way
[00:45] SubStack: what if A does 0.4.x and B does 0.5.x but it doesn't even matter because they will both work
[00:45] jesusabdullah: >= ++
[00:45] isaacs: we did make some seriously breaking changes in 0.5
[00:45] isaacs: things that actually throw and crash your server and shit
[00:45] SubStack: isaacs: yes but a way to switch off engine checking altogether would be ideal here
[00:46] SubStack: consider the user perspective
[00:46] Aria: Yeah. "Fuckit, install it, I'll hand-edit some stuff and see if I can make it work"
[00:46] SubStack: when I install a package I don't care about node versions I just want it to work and it probably does work it was just the author being overly restrictive with engine versions
[00:47] SubStack: there should be a --fucking-install-this-already so people don't have to modify package.jsons by hand
[00:47] TheJH: SubStack++
[00:47] catb0t: SubStack now has 1 beer
[00:47] plutoniix has joined the channel
[00:47] scott_gonzalez has joined the channel
[00:47] dharmesh_ has joined the channel
[00:47] SubStack: that would just disable the engine checking altogether
[00:48] SubStack: because engine checking has way too many false positives
[00:48] TheJH: SubStack, there is a switch to dummy the node version
[00:48] SubStack: TheJH: doesn't always work and why should I have to figure out what node version I need to be?
[00:48] TheJH: SubStack, right
[00:48] SubStack: also that doesn't work for the case of A has 0.4.x and B has 0.5.x
[00:49] SubStack: because there is no version I could pretend to be that satisfies the constraint
[00:49] SubStack: even though they probably just work
[00:49] SubStack: and some author was just being annoying
[00:49] Aria: (I'd be okay with completely disabling all dependency checking if you --force-deps)
[00:49] isaacs: SubStack: how about --node-version null
[00:50] SubStack: could work
[00:50] alexdoom has joined the channel
[00:50] coreb: many node users have migrated from ruby, right?
[00:50] jesusabdullah: Not me
[00:50] jesusabdullah: I came from matlab and python
[00:50] SubStack: isaacs: a shorthand for that would be nice too maybe but that's good
[00:50] killfill has joined the channel
[00:50] Aria: I did. But I was already fickle on Ruby because of Rubygems and rubygems mentality, actually.
[00:50] isaacs: SubStack: --no-node-version also works
[00:51] isaacs: SubStack: or rather, it used to, before it broke.
[00:51] Aria: (and Rails -- "here, let's modify the core" and "let's make everything a soup of dependencies.")
[00:51] isaacs: ACTION fixing it now
[00:51] jesusabdullah: woot
[00:51] SubStack: \o/
[00:52] SubStack: coreb: before node I was mostly doing haskell
[00:52] isaacs: i'm going to try doing that automatically when --force is set, but it's going to be a separate commit, because i fear needing to revert it
[00:52] SubStack: seems prudent
[00:52] coreb: so two exceptions in SubStack and jesusabdullah, everyone else did
[00:52] SubStack: --force seems like the obvious thing you would try when an engine version fails and you're like "well fuck it"
[00:53] AvianFlu: I've never written a line of ruby
[00:53] Aria: Yeah.
[00:53] coreb: neither have I
[00:53] jesusabdullah: coreb: A lot of people came from python and client-side javascript
[00:53] coreb: so four exceptions
[00:53] jesusabdullah: and perl
[00:53] SubStack: coreb: I wrote a lot of ruby too. And python. And perl.
[00:54] SubStack: and client side javascript
[00:54] coreb: why so many similar script languages?
[00:54] SubStack: and some c++ which was horrible
[00:54] AvianFlu: perl ftw!
[00:54] jesusabdullah: What's more interesting is to ask what people were building before and after node I think
[00:54] SubStack: yes
[00:54] jesusabdullah: I was doing numerical modeling
[00:55] jesusabdullah: and measurement/analysis
[00:55] isaacs: SubStack, jesusabdullah: top two are for you guys https://github.com/isaacs/npm/commits
[00:55] SubStack: hooray
[00:55] isaacs: 1.0.105 will have it, if i don't get scared and change my mind.
[00:55] isaacs: :)
[00:55] Aria: I did a lot of perl, php, c, too.

[01:10] broofa has joined the channel

[01:19] JakeSays: lol i get the impression from looking at the waf source that there is no windows support
[01:19] jon2: I opened up npm.cmd, npm_g.cmd and npm-g.cmd yet they closed... odd. And I typed in "npm help install" into node.exe. I am confused.
[01:19] JakeSays: at least no vc support

[01:20] Aria: Yeah. That's the problem.
[01:20] TheJH: JakeSays, there's currently no official way to build native extensions on windows, but I think I read something about that it works with some effort or so
[01:20] Aria: jon2: try using the commandline. Open cmd.exe and type "npm help install"
[01:20] SargoDarya: Aria: It's not a transaction in the traditional sense. I'm building a game where one user can send money to another user (transaction). Depending on the amount the user is sending it takes either more or less time until it's banked on the other users account.
[01:21] Aria: SargoDarya: Okay, and?
[01:21] gavin_huang has joined the channel
[01:21] SargoDarya: I now want to do something like: setTimeout(20000, giveFundsToUser);
[01:21] jon2: But then I get: 'npm' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. 
[01:21] JakeSays: TheJH: maybe i can just build this module directly in to node
[01:22] jon2: wait--
[01:22] isaacs: jon2: npm.cmd and node.exe are sitting in a folder, yes?
[01:22] TheJH: JakeSays, I think I also read about people doing that
[01:22] isaacs: jon2: add that folder to your PATH environment variable.

[01:23] isaacs: This: "If you decide not to update the PATH, and put the node.exe file in C:\node\node.exe, then the npm executable will end up C:\node\npm.cmd, and you'll have to type C:\node\npm <command> to use it."

[01:42] benvie: Re: above convo, pretty sure windows native modules are broken in 0.6.0, still trying to determine if it's something on my end
[01:42] benvie: but it seems to be working with my 0.5.11 binary no problem and not in 0.6.0 so I think it's not me
[01:42] jon2: How do I run a node package, then? (I have used v0.4.8 before but I'm new to 0.6.0)
[01:43] benvie: well most aren't native so it's not an issue

[01:54] benvie: wait what question? the mongo thing?
[01:54] paul__: no, about nodex.exe?
[01:55] benvie: oh, you need to keep node named node.exe if you wish to require a native module
[01:55] benvie: a .node file
[01:55] paul__: oh i see
[01:55] Aria: Oh weird.
[01:55] benvie: or else windows won't be able to resolve it, assuming you originally linked against "node"
[01:55] Aria: Heh. Gah.
[01:55] benvie: it errors out with error 126, unknown module or something
[01:55] benvie: which I thought was referring to my module, but it was referring to node itself
[01:56] benvie: I had node changed to nodex.exe because I have node.cmd which adds some flags
[01:56] benvie: just to make sure it always runs with those flags
[01:56] Aria: Heh. Fun.

[02:53] devaholic: what do you want to use it for?

[02:54] paul__: i've been using now.js in the intervening time 
[02:54] devaholic: btw, here is a little blog post about creating a blog with nodeQuery, though it's a rough draft (e.g. unfinished) the code is good! http://tomblobaum.tumblr.com/post/12362916187/rapid-development-creating-a-blog-with-nodequery

[02:58] devaholic: nQuery.use(app).use(middleware).use(authentiation) etc
[02:59] devaholic: i may add dnode-session to the blog post tonight for an example of auth
[02:59] paul__: what i meant was doing the equivalent of something like this app.get('…', loadUser, function(req, res) { ….. and then loadUser would be able to determine if they can pass or not
[02:59] devaholic: but dont qoute me on that
[02:59] paul__: a dnode-session example would be awesome.. when you get around to it :)

[05:01] paul__: Aria: do you know if it's possible to use a partial (e.g. !=partial(path)) from within a compiled jade string?
[05:01] paul__: I keep getting this ReferenceError: partial is not defined
[05:02] Aria: I think partial's just a function -- you'd have to define it yourself.
[05:02] Aria: But don't quote me on that.

[05:09] Aria: Spiffy.
[05:10] deedubs has joined the channel
[05:12] AAA_awright: paul__: A partial is just a sub-portion of the final output, if you want to do partials rendering just split apart the HTML body from the HTML page
[05:12] aoberoi: has anyone here used everyauth?
[05:12] aoberoi: specifically for password authentication
[05:12] AAA_awright: I forget how to set the render mode without outputting the header
[05:12] paul__: AAA_awright: yeah that occurred to me… might do that for other cases
[05:13] aoberoi: it seems to me that everyauth wants a separate route for the login page and another separate route for the register page, but i'd really like to include those forms on for example my index page
[05:13] AAA_awright: aoberoi: Aren't those two different things?
[05:14] aoberoi: AAA_awright: it handles a bunch of oauth providers as well as password authentication
[05:14] jbrokc_ has joined the channel
[05:14] AAA_awright: aoberoi: I mean, everyauth doesn't use passwords to authenticate
[05:14] AAA_awright: (it shouldn't be at least)
[05:15] aoberoi: AAA_awright: it actually is one of the providers https://github.com/bnoguchi/everyauth
[05:15] devaholic: aoberoi: you can do that
[05:15] JasonSmith: isaacs: Sorry, missed your message. Yeah I am all about parsing that thing. I'll email
[05:16] aoberoi: devaholic: what do i do to configure it like so
[05:16] isaacs: JasonSmith: awesome.
[05:16] JasonSmith: isaacs: BTW, my .npmignore is not behaving like I expect, trying to run `npm pack` to make sure I don't bundle 80MB of Java up with a package. Any hints?
[05:16] isaacs: JasonSmith: i was thinking we could probably have some kind of mapreduce that constructed a bitmap with one of those odometer thingies.
[05:16] devaholic: just put what is on those pages on the index page...
[05:16] isaacs: JasonSmith: maybe a hard hat cartoon animated gif or something.
[05:17] isaacs: JasonSmith: yeah, npmignore is ever so slightly buggy.
[05:17] isaacs: JasonSmith: "dir/" works, but "dir" doesn't
[05:17] JasonSmith: isaacs: Yeah that's the trick. Thanks
[05:17] aoberoi: devaholic: haha wow i feel dumb for not trying that, one sec
[05:18] JasonSmith: I have long wanted to convert log files to log databases; but the thing about the log files is (1) not skipping or duplicating log lines, and (2) dealing with log rotation
[05:18] aoberoi: i dont see the point in the .getLoginPath() and .getRegisterPath() config methods then...
[05:18] JasonSmith: Converting all my packages to Node 0.6, but once I'm done I wanted to run some quick greps to see if and how much usage spiked after the 0.6 releases
[05:18] mikeal has joined the channel
[05:19] Aria: Can you not give the same path to both?
[05:19] devaholic: they might only be need so everyauth knows on which pages to instantiate other variables for those forms, but you can just hardcode those on your home page

[06:36] JasonSmith: SubStack: Just pushed "bigdecimal", a pure-Javascript BigInteger and BigDecimal implementation. It's a little bit country, a little bit rock and roll. And then after all that, I found your bigint :)
[06:37] JasonSmith: ACTION d'ohs
[06:37] eddyb: JasonSmith: too bad there's no operators around :-<
[06:37] SubStack: hah well
[06:37] SubStack: bigint is c though which has its own limitations
[06:37] eddyb: I actually hacked some into my local copy of v8 some time ago
[06:38] isaacs: SubStack: winful
[06:38] JasonSmith: SubStack: This is "pure javascript" but that is stretching that definition pretty far. I used GWT to compile Apache Harmony's BigInteger/BigDecimal Java std lib implementations
[06:39] JasonSmith: because I wanted to do money arithmetic in CouchDB :)
[06:39] eddyb: it's not hard, the operators are defined in JS, you can easily add a check for an operator* function and call it, if it's not doing multiplication on two numbers
[06:40] JasonSmith: Also bigdecimal is a decent reference implementation for how to convert a pure Java library into a pure-Javascript one
[06:40] JasonSmith: ACTION Takes what he wants. JasonSmith don't give a shit.
[06:43] benvie: you referring to arguments.caller on like valueOf checking for ADD?

[06:51] eddyb: benvie: lol, no
[06:51] eddyb: just change the v8 code
[06:51] eddyb: to call x["operator+"](y); in ADD
[06:51] benvie: pft cheating
[06:51] eddyb: for example
[06:51] eddyb: it's not cheating
[06:51] eddyb: it's implementing stuff that should be there already
[06:51] jstash has joined the channel
[06:52] benvie: well it's not portable anyway if that matters, which it seems it didn't in your case
[06:53] eddyb: yeah, was a closed source attempt at a game :)
[06:53] benvie: yeah in which case it's probably better performance and thus important
[06:54] alexdoom has joined the channel
[06:54] eddyb: I'll use Dart next time and make parts of it opensource
[06:55] benvie: var s = { valueOf: function(){ console.dir(arguments.callee.caller.arguments[0]); return 5; } }
[06:55] benvie: that'll give you the other number in a math operation

[07:03] stagas has joined the channel
[07:03] davidbanham has joined the channel
[07:04] benvie: and yeah operator overloading across complex items gets a bit more complicated but you can do it by using the values passed as unique ids with some sort of central lookup and do the translation as a setter or proxy or something on the receiving end
[07:04] benvie: if it's a relatively simple set of values you can just encode it in the number
[07:05] benvie: like say RGB or whatever
[07:05] eddyb: ....
[07:05] eddyb: benvie: I was thinking like that
[07:05] eddyb: but why not cheat?
[07:06] benvie: well when I investigated this originally it was for browser use so that's my angle
[07:06] benvie: jsc/v8 was the easiest due to exposing the math operations like that
[07:07] benvie: just a curiosity more than anything, investiging ways to do operator overloading

[07:41] HeikoR: Busy playing with Windows C++ Addons - not sure if that's the way to go or if I'm re-inventing something already done
[07:43] benvie: TCP sounds like something pretty well covered by node already but I may be mistaken
[07:43] benvie: node core
[07:44] HeikoR: I will be digging around a bit more - spent a day trying to get node windows C++ addon working w/ node 0.6.0 - got "Out of Memory" error when trying to load package
[07:44] konobi: HeikoR: node-ctypes
[07:44] benvie: yeah the errors aren't accurate
[07:45] jbrokc has joined the channel
[07:45] HeikoR: finally figured out that I had to use the SAME name in NODE_MODULE as I use for the DLL (.node) name ... some how I missed that ! :(
[07:46] benvie: yeah I spent a few hours to learn that you can't try and load a native module from a renamed node binary
[07:46] shedinja: HeikoR: this? https://github.com/marcello3d/node-buffalo
[07:46] benvie: if you link against "node" you better be running node.exe
[07:47] benvie: a useful thing
[07:47] konobi: HeikoR: https://github.com/rmustacc/node-ctype
[07:47] HeikoR: @konobi - thanx saw mention of node-ctypes - will follow up 
[07:47] benvie: you can add this to the line right before it returns ThrowException in node.cc: 'SetErrno(err);'
[07:47] benvie: and that'll add the windows error number to global
[07:48] yozgrahame has joined the channel
[07:48] benvie: which you can then look up here http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms681382(v=vs.85).aspx
[07:49] benvie: though you already got it working so moot point now, good for future reference
[07:50] konobi: HeikoR: i've used it with a DNS server to good effect
[07:51] HeikoR: @benvie - thanx - will try that. (SetErrno ..)
[07:52] HeikoR: We have a C++ game server  (and Client written in MFC) - Trying to add a webfront end to the gameserver
[07:52] HeikoR: Considering using NodeServer as middleware.
[07:53] Marko has joined the channel
[07:53] benvie: how much data you looking to pipe?
[07:53] alexdoom has joined the channel
[07:53] benvie: just a bit for reporting/control or like a bunch
[07:53] HeikoR: Could also add protocol mapping to our gameserver (eg to map to JSON or XML etc ..) but would love to get an interface going to existing servers without any server mods
[07:54] benvie: potentially easier route may just be writing a command line app for node to run or talk to over a named pipe
[07:54] HeikoR: well we got a couple of live servers - but each only has about 100 clients connected at a time - maybe max 200
[07:55] benvie: though you already got the native module compiling so that may be the better route
[07:55] HeikoR: and games just send updates every couple of seconds - so minimal data 
[07:55] devrim has joined the channel
[07:55] benvie: it's relatively easy to expose stuff via native modules if you're not trying to do anything crazy
[07:57] devrim: hi guys does anyone know a link to an example where dnode connects to a server other than localhost ?
[07:57] HeikoR: :) I''m noting all suggestions - to be researched later ;) - Will look at pipes - note will prefer to code & run on windows. - Yup got native addon running - yay!
[07:57] SubStack: devrim: just dnode.connect('somehost', someport, fn)
[07:58] benvie: ya the windows module stuff is very new and not really documented so you're ahead of the curve
[07:58] SubStack: any string argument works
[07:58] SubStack: devrim: and make sure the listening server is bound to the right address
[07:58] devrim: thx substack - should i do anything special on server.listen side ?
[08:00] HeikoR: @benvie - no don't think I'm planning to do anything crazy - yet ! - hehe
[08:00] benvie: you will
[08:01] HeikoR: @benvie - tell me about it - windows node addon examples - ZERO .. - most examples are for unix/mac, or windows before DLOpen integration (0.6.0) - just takes a lot longer to figure out things
[08:01] SubStack: devrim: aha by default it listens on 127.0.0.1
[08:01] SubStack: .listen(port, '0.0.0.0')

[08:02] HeikoR: same here
[08:03] benvie: the windows stuff has required all new stuff, hence all of libuv
[08:03] benvie: which also means all the node-waf stuff is outdated and doesn't apply to windows
[08:04] HeikoR: yup got stuck with node-waf aswell 
[08:04] jbrokc_ has joined the channel
[08:04] benvie: node has transitioned to gyp for its build system and node-waf is still there pretty much because it's simple and still works for all the platforms it used to. But it'll be replaced by gyp entirely at some point
[08:04] benvie: which works on everything
[08:05] plutoniix has joined the channel
[08:05] SubStack: devrim: ok now dnode listens on 0.0.0.0 in 0.9.2
[08:05] HeikoR: yeah - had looked at them aswell - though I was missing a setting in my MSVC (windows) Project - meanwhile was just the module name 
[08:05] SubStack: unless otherwise specified
[08:05] benvie: at some point I'll sit down and dig into gyp and make a module build script if an official one isn't done soon
[08:06] benvie: for now I just have a basic visual studio project
[08:06] benvie: yeah I went through all that too, all the C++ and linker settings thinking it was some random thing
[08:07] HeikoR: yup MSVC Project good
[08:07] benvie: pretty sure none of the settings matter in terms of making it work aside from compiling it as a Multi-threaded DLL with the includes and linked against node.lib
[08:07] devrim: @substack trying 0.9.2 now..
[08:07] HeikoR: yeah compare every single setting to see where I was going wrong .... meanwhile somewhere else
[08:08] HeikoR:  the default settings  (MSVC DLL) work fine 
[08:08] benvie: I was even assisted with that error code change so I knew it was error 126, module not found
[08:08] benvie: I just thought that meant my module wasn't being correctly found, not node itself
[08:08] devrim: @substack - works! awesome thanks!
[08:09] HeikoR: ;) - hehe - that would have helped more that "Out of memory" 
[08:09] HeikoR: ok lemme got read up more and try a few things - thanx a lot for the help ! 
[08:09] benvie: yeah, those extra errors were added a couple days and are currently worse for debugging. Prior to that it just did the error number thing I said
[08:10] HeikoR: ps: 1 last thing - do you use web irc client or are the better options  (currently chatting via web interface)
[08:11] benvie: mirc until I finish this basic node-cef bridge and then I'll make my own
[08:12] HeikoR: The "out of memory" bug took me half a day to figure out ! - was looking in all the wrong places and at old examples and not many windows examples - steeper learning curve when you start off with new things 
[08:12] tvw has joined the channel
[08:12] benvie: yeah it probably would have helped you most if you just knew not to bother looking for answers and just to read the source
[08:13] benvie: too new
[08:13] HeikoR: that's how I found it - but looking at the source, the macros, and replacing them with what I passed in .. (in node.h)

[11:10] eddyb: konobi: knowing the difference between Local and Persistent, knowing what MakeWeak does, stuff like that
[11:11] konobi: meh, that stuff has gone out of my head... the v8 developers guide has a bunch of that though... but mostly it's RTFS

[11:15] mmalecki: anyone here using vim? you may like this: https://github.com/mmalecki/vim-node.js
[11:15] eddyb: konobi: that's the basics
[11:15] eddyb: I need someone who I can talk with
[11:15] mmalecki: it detect node.js shebangs like !/usr/bin/env node or !/usr/bin/node
[11:16] H4ns_: eddyb: i missed your original question, but i'm writing node extensions in c++, so maybe repeat it.
[11:17] eddyb: there was no question, just curious if there was someone I could ask the questions I have in mind
[11:17] konobi: eddyb: TIAS... also just read the source to other addons
[11:17] H4ns: eddyb: then fire ahead.
[11:17] eddyb: H4ns: what is the impact on performance if one is using Persistent handles everywhere?
[11:18] eddyb: is it better to reuse a Persistent handle (copy it) instead of using Persistent::New everytime?
[11:18] anoop has joined the channel
[11:18] eddyb: how does MakeWeak act when it's called multiple times for the same Persistent handle?
[11:19] H4ns: eddyb: i can't answer any of these, sorry.
[11:20] eddyb: exactly my reason of not asking them like that without making sure first someone knows the answer :P
[11:20] H4ns: eddyb: how can you be sure that noone knows the answer if you haven't asked the question?
[11:21] galaxywatcher has joined the channel
[11:21] eddyb: well, nobody said "yeah, I've been coding in node and I know my way around v8" :P
[11:22] H4ns: eddyb: i'm doing that :), but i use persistent handles only when i need them to outlive the current scope.
[11:22] hellp has joined the channel
[11:22] eddyb: I'm not using Local handles *at all*
[11:22] konobi: yeah, generally i only use Local handles
[11:22] eddyb: I have a wrapper around a Persistent handle
[11:23] eddyb: and I can move that around as I wish
[11:23] konobi: since they're only used per-context really
[11:34] remysharp: In the new cluster example code, it referes to `process.send` - should this method be on the process API page? http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/process.html
[11:36] mmalecki: remysharp: I would say yes
[11:37] remysharp: do you know if the master can send messages back to the workers?
[11:37] liar has joined the channel
[11:37] mmalecki: remysharp: if workers set up process.on('message'), I think
[11:38] konobi: > console.log(process.send)
[11:38] konobi: undefined
[11:39] remysharp: mmalecki: cheer - yeah that worked.
[11:39] remysharp: *cheers
[11:39] konobi: it's onyl available if you're a child process

[11:41] remysharp: konobi: it is...sorta - there's no method link, but I see it talking about .send in there
[11:41] wbednarski has joined the channel
[11:42] remysharp: should I be using a master to do the heavy/blocking processing, and let the workers deal with regular web requests?
[11:42] remysharp: (and communicate via messages)
[11:42] mehlah has joined the channel
[11:45] remysharp: Did that make sense? or is it just Sunday :)
[11:46] mmalecki: I would use two types of workers, one dealing with web requests and second one to deal with computations/etc.

[15:50] Destos has joined the channel
[15:50] secoif: hrm, what's the go with module.exports = exports, I don't quite get why have both.
[15:51] secoif: as in
[15:51] Aria: exports is the more commonly used, so it's sugared.
[15:51] secoif: module.exports = exports = function() {//etc}
[15:51] Aria: Yeah, you don't have to replace exports that way. Just module.exports.
[15:52] pquerna: tedwing: honestly 10.4 is getting pretty long in the tooth, i've not heard of anyone doing 0.6 on it.
[15:53] secoif: Aria I've just seen tj doing it, so I figured there might be some reason
[15:53] secoif: perhaps backwards compatibility
[15:53] secoif: i'm  looking at a oldish module
[15:53] Aria: Oh. Dear. Tiger is ancient. You will definitely have to hack at it to make it even build.
[15:53] Aria: secoif: I think TJ just likes his sugar consistent. I don't blame him.
[15:54] Aria: (If you later do a normal exports.foo = it stays working)
[15:55] lmatteis: "Without a leading '/' or './' to indicate a file, the module is either a "core module" or is loaded from a node_modules folder."
[15:55] lmatteis: does that mean node will look inside {prefix}/lib/node_modules before looking inside the current directory ./node_modules?
[15:55] Aria: Nope.
[15:55] storrgie has joined the channel
[15:55] Aria: Just the current directory.
[15:56] lmatteis: say I have a module that exists both in my local ./node_modules and in {prefix}/lib/node_modules.. which one will node use?
[15:56] Aria: Local.
[15:56] tedwing: pquerna Aria Yeah, it's an old OS so would make sense that it's not really supported. Was wondering if there was some way I could get it to build here.
[15:56] lmatteis: Aria: ok, so when does node fallback and use the one in {prefix}/lib...
[15:56] kkszysiu has joined the channel
[15:56] Aria: Never.
[15:57] Aria: tedwing: I think the only answer there is "very carefully"
[15:57] pquerna: tedwing: would have to look at that headers it erroring out on, see what it is doing
[15:57] lmatteis: Aria: uh?
[15:57] Aria: lmatteis: Seriously. Never.
[15:57] lmatteis: Aria: but npm (with -g) installs things inside {prefix}/lib/node_modules
[15:57] Aria: Yes, yes it does.
[15:58] lmatteis: so...?
[15:58] Aria: So what?
[15:58] Aria: That's the thing. There's no magic. Don't expect stuff in prefix/lib/node_modules to work.
[15:58] lmatteis: really? and how does it work?
[15:58] Aria: npm with -g is to make globally installed scripts work.
[15:58] Aria: And they do.
[15:58] Aria: Just install things locally.
[15:58] secoif: lmatteis -g is really only for executables
[15:59] tedwing: pquerna: I was afraid of that but looks like the only way. Probably not worth it.
[15:59] lmatteis: secoif: so for the command line?
[15:59] secoif: eg a test runner, coffeescript compiler, etc 
[15:59] secoif: yep
[15:59] secoif: install modules for your app with npm install
[15:59] lmatteis: hrm
[15:59] secoif: install modules with scripts you want to execute with npm install -g
[16:00] lmatteis: so when in code you do require('foo')... it will only look up the chain of node_modules and never inside {prefix}/lib?
[16:00] Aria: Right.
[16:00] lmatteis: fine, thanks for the clarification
[16:00] Aria: "Don't do that, otherwise someone will reinvent Rubygems."
[16:00] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[16:00] secoif: a lot of tutorials do gloss over this, and any pre npm 1.0 tutorials have no concept of npm install -g
[16:00] lmatteis: secoif: i really had a hard time finding any npm tutorials
[16:00] Aria: Yeah. npm is very strange as a package manager goes. In an excellent way.
[16:00] lmatteis: just relying on man pages
[16:01] Aria: There's none of this "which version am I loading?" nonsense that requires a sophisticated loader. npm just installs things into your project, which then uses them.
[16:01] francisl has joined the channel
[16:01] coderdad has joined the channel
[16:01] Aria: Ooh. I should suggest that isaacs have npm throw a warning installing something with no executables with -g
[16:01] secoif: also note, the two most magical switches
[16:01] lmatteis: so for example, ./node_modules/foo/node_modules/bar
[16:01] secoif: npm init
[16:02] secoif: and npm install --save
[16:02] lmatteis: secoif: what about them?
[16:02] Aria: That looks right: the curent module uses foo, which uses bar.
[16:02] secoif: init takes you through setting up your package.json (your Gemfile if you're from ruby)
[16:02] devaholic has joined the channel
[16:02] secoif: --save will update your package.json with the module you're installing
[16:03] secoif: saves you time having to track down version numbers to put in your package.json

[16:04] Aria: Yeah. It's a great workflow.

[16:04] apoc has joined the channel
[16:04] Aria: ACTION tilts her hat at apoc
[16:04] lmatteis: Aria: right, but when you do require('foo'); that code will require('bar').. and the lookup for the 'bar' module will happen inside the ./node_modules/foo directory because that's where require('foo') is, right? so Node is smart enough to figure this stuff out, right?
[16:04] Aria: Yep!
[16:04] Aria: The rules really are that simple.
[16:04] secoif: Aria my ruby mates are always jealous when i show them npm
[16:05] Aria: secoif: I bet.  IT's the good 1% of gems and bundler, without any of the complexity.
[16:05] secoif: spot on.
[16:05] JasonJS has joined the channel
[16:05] Aria: isaacs has done an amazing job of squashing the complexity. It required completely trashing one of the old must-haves of package management.

[16:06] lmatteis: bit how does node know about the ./node_modules/foo path? it only cares about the current working directory? or not
[16:06] lmatteis: i guess not
[16:06] Aria: No. It only cares about the current file's actual location.
[16:06] secoif: Aria of which must-have do you speak?
[16:06] Aria: secoif: "install the package globally"
[16:07] lmatteis: Aria: ok, but when you do require('http')... that stuff is in {prefix}/lib right?
[16:07] Aria: Nope.
[16:07] secoif: yeah. god. I resisted at first, but it definitely makes much more sense.
[16:07] Aria: That's compiled into the node core.
[16:07] lmatteis: Aria: "The core modules are defined in node's source in the lib/ folder."
[16:07] Xano has joined the channel
[16:07] Aria: Yes. _in the source_
[16:07] Aria: But when it's compiled, it includes them.
[16:08] lmatteis: ah right
[16:08] zomg: Anyone know how to silence socket.io's debug output?
[16:08] lmatteis: Aria: so {prefix}/lib is just to have PATH point to somewhere that you can use in the command line?
[16:08] garrensmith: anyone used json-schema for validations?
[16:08] zomg: nvm, of course I found it as soon as I asked
[16:09] zomg: For the record, it probably is io.set('log level', 0) 
[16:10] secoif: garrensmith I did try using it, i found it a little restrictive… good for validating json, but there's a few times that doesn't work real good
[16:10] secoif: eg dates
[16:11] quackquack: Anyone seen this error with Zombiejs? "Timeout: Cannot set property cssText of [object Object] which has only a getter"
[16:11] lmatteis: secoif: but isn't the logic really inside node? i mean npm follows the node_modules logic and that's it basically
[16:12] Aria: quackquack: that's not zombie itself -- that's inside jsdom or cssom. I'm tracking some bugs there, too.
[16:12] lmatteis: Aria: "Second, if the file calling require() is already inside a node_modules hierarchy, then the top-most node_modules folder is treated as the root of the search tree."
[16:12] Aria: lmatteis: Yeah, the prefix/lib is just a good place for npm to stick stuff that commandline scripts work with.

[16:13] garrensmith: secoif: what does it do with dates?
[16:13] secoif: lmatteis I dont get you sorry?
[16:13] quackquack: Aria: k, ill go take a look at those issues. its weird though, yesterday i didnt have any errors, but when I ran my tests this morning w/o changing anything it spewed warnings
[16:13] lmatteis: ok i get it
[16:13] garrensmith: secoif: I like the idea of it but just worried it could be over kill
[16:13] zivester has joined the channel
[16:13] _Blorb has joined the channel
[16:14] secoif: garrensmith it would validate Dates and empty arras as valid objects
[16:14] lmatteis: secoif: no i was just saying that you guys are saying that npm does great job at squishing out the complexity of package management. but isn't the power of it inside Node (and not npm) since Node decides where to lookup the modules and allows you to have a nested tree folder structure with all the dependencies included.
[16:15] Aria: Yeah. That's why it works so well.
[16:15] secoif: I ended up just using node-validator
[16:15] secoif: garrensmith
[16:15] garrensmith: secoif: cool I'll check that out
[16:15] Aria: this is new in node 0.4 -- npm 1.0 and node 0.4 co-evolved, and it's turned out great.
[16:15] Aria: Nothing like getting the logic in the right place.
[16:15] secoif: garrensmith https://github.com/chriso/node-validator
[16:15] Aria: .oO(Imagine how Ruby would have turned out if there wasn't a language barrier around the core?)
[16:16] garrensmith: secoif: thanks, I wrote a couchdb odm and I want to add validation to it. So trying to decide if I should write my own or if I can use another library. 
[16:16] secoif: ha, I'm using it with mongoose atm.

[16:19] mmalecki: shedinja: notice that assert is a function now

[16:21] Aria: This is what you get for modifying core objects.
[16:21] mmalecki: Aria++
[16:22] shedinja: secoif: yes. i did not modify the test. i was testing it again because of node v0.6.0

[17:13] maushu: SargoDarya, its not dedicated, a VPS host is already being used for other stuff.
[17:13] torsd: SargoDarya: what you are trying to say is that have a vps for mongodb alone?
[17:13] SargoDarya: yes
[17:13] maushu: Feel free to use that vps for other stuff.
[17:14] torsd: then you can
[17:14] SargoDarya: maushu: why? I read that mongo can be pretty resource intensive
[17:15] maushu: Unless your mongo process requires more performance (by checking the logs), in that case don't use that vps for other stuff.
[17:15] maushu: Besides that you need a dedicated server.
[17:16] AvianFlu: vps = one virtual piece of a physical host, dedicated = one physical host
[17:16] SargoDarya: maybe later then when my stuff gets out of beta
[17:16] AvianFlu: just to clarify for anybody confused
[17:16] maushu: SargoDarya, what I'm trying to say is that unless your mongo process requires more performance you don't need to "waste" a whole vps on it.
[17:16] ICO_II has left the channel
[17:17] SargoDarya: ok. noted that. Thanks so far guys

[17:20] Aria: If you fit within the feature set, it's excellent, and you have low-level control.
[17:20] Aria: Yeh, it's perfect for sandboxiing.
[17:20] Aria: It's basically BSD Jails done a different way.

[17:35] isaacs: but there should be some errors in the logs from just now
[17:35] cconstantine_: alessioalex, am I wrong that multiple processes (not node specific) can't listen on the same port?
[17:36] mraleph has joined the channel
[17:36] isaacs: cconstantine: the master server listens on the port, then it shares the file descriptor with the children
[17:36] alessioalex: no you're right about that, it's only that Node forked processes (with cluster) can actually listen to the same port
[17:36] jaequery has joined the channel
[17:36] isaacs: cconstantine: so, the fd is opened once, and the actual fd is passed to the children.  so, the port is only opened once, but there are multiple processes calling accept() on the same file descriptor
[17:37] mmalecki: is there a way to achieve daemon-like behaviour with cluster?
[17:37] isaacs: mmalecki: i don't think it's really for that.
[17:37] mmalecki: isaacs: I know it isn't, just wondering
[17:37] cconstantine_: isaacs, ahh, awesome.  So my special nifty socket lib will still work.
[17:37] isaacs: mmalecki: the best way to daemonize would be to use something like upstart, imo
[17:37] JasonSmith: isaacs: You're back on 1.1.0
[17:38] mmalecki: isaacs: daemon.node is a win here
[17:38] isaacs: cconstantine: it should.  so, here's the thing tho: the children don't have any shared global state or memory.
[17:38] JasonSmith: I'll dig in to the logs tomorrow
[17:38] JasonSmith: ACTION notes the time

[17:58] enmand has joined the channel
[17:58] isaacs: JasonSmith: yeah, i was considering even something kinda like the CouchDBX would be awesome.
[17:59] isaacs: JasonSmith: like, wrap up couchdb, replication policies, and even the ability to install stuff into certain folders, all in a gui
[17:59] isaacs: then the local registry mirror is like an offline cache that just updates when it can.
[18:00] mmalecki: also, shameless advertisement: if you're using vim with node.js, you'll probably like my script for detecting node shebangs: https://github.com/mmalecki/vim-node.js / http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3798
[18:00] JasonSmith: isaacs: Yeah one of my fantasy projects is an app in the Mac app store that is just like, voila!
[18:00] ICO_II has joined the channel
[18:00] isaacs: JasonSmith: yeah
[18:00] isaacs: maybe even bundle node in there, too, wth
[18:01] JasonSmith: because I already have a nice, tight, standalone build of CouchDB and all its dependencies and NodeJS and NPM
[18:01] isaacs: while we're blue-skying this ask
[18:01] JasonSmith: As we speak I have a build/ directory that anybody with OS X Lion could rsync from me and have crazy couch and Node
[18:01] isaacs: and you could have just the wrapper around the gui be different, and use exactly the same code for a windows client
[18:01] JasonSmith: but it's like... the app store? Am I crazy? Not while couches are still crashing :)
[18:02] ohtogo has joined the channel

[18:07] swaj: so I've hooked in some custom error handling for my express app.  Is there a good library for sending emails?  I'd like to email myself stack traces and such in production when errors happen.
[18:08] ej__h has joined the channel
[18:08] Aria: That's an addin for 0.4, JakeSays. It has to be ported to libuv for 0.6.
[18:08] Aria: The ports are simple, but not automatable. There's a few semantic differences, and libuv is simplified over libev.
[18:08] JakeSays: Aria: i was afraid you'd say that. 
[18:09] Aria: I know how to do the entire port except eio_custom (I've never used it)
[18:09] Aria: I'd be happy to help if you want to dive into it.
[18:09] JakeSays: Aria: well, there's only two methods that appear to use the old code: EIO_ToBuffer and EIO_AfterToBuffer
[18:09] JakeSays: Aria: i'd greatly appreciate it :)
[18:09] Aria: What's the module?
[18:09] JakeSays: node-canvas

[18:10] Aria: Oh node-canvas. Fun!
[18:10] Aria: ACTION gets the hardcore forking action on

[18:17] Aria: Basically, after the EIO function returns, it converts its results into something node can deal with (a buffer), and vice versa going the other way.
[18:17] JakeSays: hmm. they're actually used in Canvas::ToBuffer

[18:23] mikeal: that's such a terrible argument

[18:23] mikeal: because the authors are C# programmers and because they seeded it by bringing over a huge C# community
[18:24] mikeal: nobody ever claimed that C# was popular there because it was hard, it was always because there were just more damn people
[18:24] JasonSmith: note, that graph is very hard to understand. That is *relative* difference in representation between two totally meaningless measurements
[18:24] isaacs: well, also, javascript is used by a lot of non-javascript programmers

[18:26] JasonSmith: My guess is, this effect (and it has yet to be established that the effect is meaningful) has to do with some halfway-decent and mature C# and Java support communities already out there, but S.O. hit Javascript's second wind just at the right time
[18:27] mikeal: Java lost almost 1% of its popularity in September. If this trend continues, C will be number one again next month.
[18:27] mikeal: fuq ya!
[18:27] isaacs: JakeSays: when i worked with vb full time, a bunch fo people probably thought i had a speech impediment and was just a really bad driver.

[18:28] JasonSmith: The question posed to our generation is this:
[18:28] JasonSmith: Are computers part of the problem?
[18:29] JasonSmith: Or are computers part of the problem and also part of the solution?
[18:29] Aria: I'm poking at getting cairo working so I can compile it, JakeSays. It shouldn't be hard.
[18:29] Aria: (but I'm on a Mac, and so Cairo is being annoying.)
[18:29] JakeSays: Aria: ah ok. cool.
[18:29] mikeal: C is nearly twice as popular as C++ on this chart
[18:29] JakeSays: yeah. cairo was a pain on windows as well
[18:29] Aria: And the coffeeshop just started playing christmas music. That's gonna slow me down

[18:30] JakeSays: JasonSmith: they're really c++ devs who aren't ready to come out of the closet
[18:30] mikeal: 1) lots of people know C
[18:30] Aria: Lots of people call C++ C, most unix people have to touch as much C as C++ if not more, and C is a better binding language, since it's got a one-dimensional ABI.
[18:30] ICO_II has left the channel
[18:30] mikeal: 2) it's tought in any CS school that isn't shit
[18:31] mikeal: 3) by "third party vendors" i think they mean IDEs
[18:31] mikeal: there are lots of C IDEs
[18:31] JasonSmith: I thought a lot of those surveys are what you are *paid* to write, not like what is the lingua franca that everybody halfway remembers
[18:31] JasonSmith: but yeah, all valid points
[18:31] mikeal: lots of people write C
[18:32] JakeSays: and yeah, when it comes to gluing things together, c is just about the best glue around
[18:32] JasonSmith: Now I feel like programming in C is like my old childhood nightmares of running from a monster but I am stuck in tar.

[18:40] eddyb: played some wow and watched videos on youtube all fucking day
[18:40] JakeSays: eddyb: hmm. maybe there's something wrong with your api
[18:40] Aria: Oh, whoa, JakeSays. Looks like the git head version of node-canvas already works on 0.5.x. Try installing that rather than the npm published version
[18:41] JakeSays: Aria: i'm on git head
[18:41] Aria: Really. Huh.

[18:44] JakeSays: eddyb: it will be when i get it working under windows :)
[18:44] Aria: Do you have some old node 0.4.x headers lying around?
[18:44] eddyb: I could have a standalone version of an web-game / web-client
[18:44] JakeSays: Aria: not that i'm aware of.
[18:44] Aria: (did you install node 0.6 over 0.4, or did you clean up, or did you install elsewhere?)
[18:44] Aria: It sounds a lot like you hit node 0.4 headers.
[18:45] JakeSays: Aria: i started totally clean
[18:45] Aria: Never used 0.4 on that box?
[18:45] JakeSays: nope
[18:45] JakeSays: its a windows box
[18:45] Aria: Hrm.
[18:45] JakeSays: but to get it to compile i did have to include eio.h and ev.h from uv-private
[18:45] Aria: Oh, wait, what?!
[18:46] JakeSays: lol yeah
[18:46] Aria: you DON'T want to do that. ev.h is UNIX only.
[18:46] JakeSays: ah

[19:02] lmatteis: what else does it do? how exactly does it resolve dependency conflicts? maybe i need an example of a dependency conflict
[19:02] Aria: Dependencies don't often conflict.
[19:02] Aria: (since each module's dependencies are isolated from other module's dependencies)
[19:03] JakeSays: Aria: ah so uv_ref instead of ev_ref.. those kinds of things
[19:03] Aria: app -> (foo -> lib v 1), (bar -> lib v 2)
[19:03] lmatteis: Aria: right, but an example of a conflict that it would solve?
[19:03] Aria: In rubygems, app -> foo -> lib v1 and bar -> lib v2 would be a conflict "Can't activate lib v1 and v2 at the same time"
[19:03] Aria: fg
[19:04] Aria: JakeSays: Yeah. The EIO_custom is the only part that's hard -- that's basically a wrapper around "do this in a thread and tell me when it's done"

[19:04] JakeSays: ah ok.

[19:07] hkjels: Know of a good indexer / search for node that does not require running an actual db-server?
[19:07] Aria: I think uv_queue_work is more akin to process.nextTick: It does it synchronously, but later.
[19:07] level09: Aria: I'm referring to the async module, it allows writing synchronous and asynchronous tasks 
[19:07] justmoon has joined the channel
[19:07] Aria: level09: what 'async' module?

[19:08] Aria: Oh. So it does, JakeSays
[19:09] Aria: level09: It's ... a thing, sure. But you only use it if it solves a problem you're having. Are you having THAT problem?
[19:09] level09: Aria: kind of, asynchronous code can get really ugly
[19:09] Aria: Anyone who uses a flow control library without having written their own probably doesn't understand it.
[19:09] Aria: level09: Sure, sometimes. What problem are you trying to solve with it?
[19:10] Aria: Sounds a little like you've found a really nice hammer and are looking for things to hit with it.
[19:10] JakeSays: Aria: lol the implementation of uv_queue_work uses eio_custom
[19:10] Aria: Always?

[19:11] Aria: Hm.
[19:11] Aria: level09: Okay. .. why?
[19:11] level09: Aria: if we keep hooking functions to the callback, we will reach a point where the code is completely unreadable
[19:11] perezd has joined the channel
[19:11] level09: even if we split them into separate functions
[19:11] Aria: Sure, sometimes.
[19:11] Aria: But you have to use the right tool to solve your complexity.
[19:12] level09: Aria: do you recommend anything else?
[19:12] Aria: Depends on what problem you're solving!
[19:12] level09: I'm just trying really
[19:12] level09: I used to use http-agent module
[19:12] level09: Aria: okay here is the problem
[19:13] level09: let's say I want to execute tasks A B C in a sequence
[19:13] level09: then within task A I want A1 A2 A3 to be executed in parallel 
[19:13] Aria: JakeSays: in libuv/src/win/threadpool.c, there's uv_queue_work without eio.

[19:23] JakeSays: so how i have my custom node.exe with node-canvas baked in. how does the module get initialized?
[19:23] JakeSays: do i compile in the node-canvas js libs ?
[19:24] Aria: Baked in?
[19:24] Aria: You didn't make a .node file?

[19:25] Aria: Hopefully, you could just require the javascripts and it'll find the bindings.

[19:55] Swizec: mmalecki thanks
[19:55] Swizec: and other than that I just develop normally?
[19:56] benvie: also it's important to note that there's a lot of other stuff that happens in any random C+++ module than may or may not (probably not) be ported to windows yet
[19:56] benvie: so it's not just magically going to work 
[19:56] mmalecki: Swizec: yeah
[19:57] benvie: most of its trivial but does require someone to actuall do some work

[20:44] mrshogun: i understood that Xatter, but even in that case i think it would be a good approach

[20:46] mrshogun: their

[20:56] jerrysv_: will know the error code in a minute
[20:56] jerrysv_: just need to recompile

[22:09] MrNibbles: TheJH: harm :( watch is pretty much useless under osX it seems
[22:09] level09: modules doesn't seem to be supported
[22:09] MrNibbles: hrrm* not harm!
[22:09] level09: can I downgrade it with mac ports ?
[22:09] Aria: I bet ryah'd accept patches to add proper kqueue support on MacOS
[22:10] Aria: level09: I have no idea. Does macports have 0.5 available? (Why macports? Does macports ship unstable versions of things?)
[22:10] MrNibbles: Aria: most likely!

[22:10] level09: macports is just a bit cleaner to manage installs / uninstalls
[22:10] mmalecki: MrNibbles: why is that?
[22:10] JakeSays: so given that node uses v8's debugging support, it seems like it wouldn't take much to be able to debug using chrome's devtools as the debugger client
[22:11] mmalecki: MrNibbles: (that watch thing)
[22:11] level09: I'll just reinstall the 0.5 though
[22:11] MrNibbles: mmalecki: doesn't give you a filename of the files that are modified when watching a folder
[22:11] MrNibbles: and all events seem to be 'rename'
[22:11] mmalecki: MrNibbles: hm. that would explain quite a few issues with my code.
[22:12] level09: hmm on the website there is 0.4 and 0.6 ,  there is no stable 0.5 ?
[22:12] level09: I guess I'll go back to .4 then

[22:38] poseid: i am running 0.5.4 and want to go to 0.6
[22:38] fella: So... are compatibility issues in v0.5.8 fixed in v0.6.0?
[22:38] jerrysv: fella: what sort of compatibility issues?
[22:39] fella: Like this: https://github.com/alaingilbert/Turntable-API
[22:39] fella: it's compatible with v0.4.0 but not v0.5.8
[22:39] jerrysv: fella: you need to bug module authors to update
[22:39] sdwrage has joined the channel
[22:40] jerrysv: and no, if a module isn't compatible with 0.5.10 then it will not work with 0.6

[22:42] jerrysv: dunno, i don't run windows.  though most of the incompatibilities came about during the port to windows. irony.

[22:45] zomg: updated to 0.6.0 from 0.4.6, no compat issue with my app
[22:45] zomg: and the random socket not writable issue is gone :)
[22:45] JakeSays: how much of jquery is usable in node? 
[22:45] zomg: JakeSays: I have a hard time thinking of any reasons why you would want to use jquery in server side javascript

[22:46] TheJH: JakeSays, there's a jquery module for node, do you know it?
[22:46] TheJH: !npm search jquery
[22:46] jhbot: packages (short format, truncated): crawler, node-sizzle, jspp, jkwery, jjw, jquery-mousewheel, query, jqserve, jquery-drive, capt, jqbuild, jquery.effects.blind, jquery.effects.bounce, jquery.effects.clip, jquery.effects.core, jquery.effects.drop, jquery.effects.explode, jquery.effects.fade, jquery.effects.fold, jquery.effects.highlight
[22:46] zomg: fella: I didn't try those
[22:46] TheJH: !npm info jquery
[22:46] jhbot: jquery by John Resig, version 1.6.3: jQuery: The Write Less, Do More, JavaScript Library (packaged for Node.JS)
[22:46] JakeSays: TheJH: i wasnt aware. thanks!

[22:47] JakeSays: correct
[22:47] TheJH: JakeSays, how do you install libraries?
[22:47] zomg: Heh, well the only compat issue so far is npm broke
[22:47] tbranyen: woot 0.6 is in arch repo
[22:47] TheJH: JakeSays, and why not npm?
[22:47] mmalecki: jesusabdullah wrote a sweet npm module for using jquery in the console
[22:47] zomg: but I probably have some very old version of it considering I had 0.4.6 node :P
[22:48] mmalecki: s/npm/node/g
[22:48] JakeSays: TheJH: i'm on windows for one, and i have a custom build of node with node-canvas built in.

[23:36] Stephen: RestMVC seems pretty full-featured, even going so far as to build out files for your project
[23:36] JakeSays: isaacs: since i'm not using npm i need to set this up manually
[23:37] Stephen: Basically, I have a mongodb (mongoose) backend, and I'm just looking for something that will tack on all the simple calls for me, and allow me to add on the custom stuff
[23:37] isaacs: JakeSays: why are you not using npm?
[23:37] isaacs: JakeSays: (just curious)
[23:37] JakeSays: isaacs: well, i have a custom build of node. 
[23:37] JakeSays: so none of the package stuff is set up
[23:37] isaacs: JakeSays: "custom build"?
[23:38] Stephen: So I suppose I'm looking for a good REST router...
[23:38] isaacs: what does that mean?
[23:38] JakeSays: yes. it has node-canvas built in
[23:38] isaacs: k... but that doens't preclude you from installing npm, does it?
[23:38] JakeSays: isaacs: no idea. 
[23:38] isaacs: try this: curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
[23:39] isaacs: or just download the script and run it
[23:39] isaacs: is this on windows, or unix?
[23:39] JakeSays: windows
[23:39] JakeSays: so no sh'ing
[23:39] isaacs: oh, ok, so try this: http://npmjs.org/doc/README.html#Installing-on-Windows-Experimental
[23:40] Stephen: JakeSays: I can say from experience that setting npm up on windows will take a little time, but it's well worth it
[23:40] Stephen: I have it up and running right now

[23:40] Revernd has joined the channel
[23:40] isaacs: JakeSays: but, anyway, if you still can't or for some reason don't want to use npm, all you really have to do is drop the project folder into ./node_modules inside your project to use it
[23:41] isaacs: JakeSays: npm does this, but it also does all the dependencies of those things
[23:41] isaacs: and can run build scripts, etc
[23:41] JakeSays: isaacs: well, i'd kinda like to understand how it all works before using npm
[23:42] mmalecki: isaacs: sometimes I'm getting weird errors like https://gist.github.com/b6863e95aa29323e5053 , any idea why?
