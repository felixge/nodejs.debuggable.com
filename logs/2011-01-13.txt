[01:54] isaacs_ has joined the channel
[01:54] bingomanatee_: oh like mongoos
[01:54] Aikar: express isnt a mongodb driver >_>
[01:54] bingomanatee_: no native is the status quo.
[01:55] bingomanatee_: sorry I misread your question
[01:55] bingomanatee_: And in fact I've had problems with the alternatives. 
[01:55] Aikar: bleh mongoose looks great but its documentation doesnt match its source code :/
[01:55] bingomanatee_: Its pretty much roll your own or use mongoose at this point. 
[01:55] Aikar: mongoose is unusable it seems lol
[01:55] bingomanatee_: yes I would reccommend making personal contacts at LearnBoost to get the long awaited next release or roll your own.

[01:56] Aikar: the noSchema function doesnt exists
[01:56] bingomanatee_: I am not using it myself - I'm not going as far as to call it unusable but I didn't see a lot of worth in using it. 
[01:56] bingomanatee_: If you want to see some examples of native in use I've been using it in my home brew project noogle on git.
[01:57] bingomanatee_: but your initial question (and please someone correct me if I'm missing something) has a short answer: no.

[01:59] bingomanatee_: Native is, er, "bearable" once you use it enough. 
[02:02] bingomanatee_: Aikar: my experience is that node puts you very close to a lot of low level systems and gives you more control at the expense of an "Enterprise" ruby level experience with conventions and schema. Learnboost has been claiming that Mongoose will release since December and state that they are simply testing and refining their ORM and improving test coverage at this point.

[02:59] Figaroo: I don't even know how to do that with PHP
[02:59] Aikar: you dont
[02:59] Aikar: thats an apache config
[02:59] Aikar: but node js does not run under apache
[03:00] Aikar: it replaces apache
[03:00] Figaroo: right
[03:00] Figaroo: I meant, I don't know how to do that with apache
[03:00] Aikar: so to also host multiple domains under node with diff file bases would be messy
[03:00] Lorentz: Virtual host config, ServerName and ServerAlias if you have more
[03:00] Figaroo: frankly, I don't know much about apache as that has been sort of abstracted from me when install things like Wamp/XAMPP

[03:10] Aikar: just make somefile.js
[03:10] Aikar: then do module.exports = {foo: function(){console.log('bar')}}
[03:11] Figaroo: But doing it in js would be limited
[03:11] IRONkyle has joined the channel
[03:11] Ond: Why
[03:11] Aikar: then var somefile =  require('./somefile');
[03:11] Aikar: js is turing complete, not limited, but C would be faster yes
[03:11] Aikar: depends on what you need to do
[03:11] Figaroo: how could I write a email module if Node.js doesn't come with any email API?
[03:11] Aikar: you write an SMTP protocol
[03:11] Aikar: but someones already done that
[03:11] Aikar: just get a module off NPM
[03:12] Figaroo: off topic: I'm not a ruby guy, but is NPM sort of like GEM in ruby?
[03:12] Aikar: i think so, im not a ruby guy either :p
[03:12] Figaroo: okay
[03:12] mgutz: yes, very similar
[03:12] Figaroo: *back on subject*
[03:12] Aikar: its like yum/apt-get
[03:12] Aikar: a package manager
[03:13] Figaroo: exactly what I thought. thanks.
[03:13] Figaroo: however...
[03:13] Figaroo: I suppose email is built on top of SMTP and IMAP?
[03:13] Aikar: IMAP is a retrieval type format mainly
[03:13] Figaroo: And those protocols are built on top of TCP/IP, which Node comes with an API for?
[03:13] Aikar: SMTP is "Send Mail Transfer Protocol"
[03:13] Aikar: yes
[03:14] Aikar: node is designed around writing TCP networking apps
[03:14] Figaroo: So the modules could be built with js in this case.
[03:14] Aikar: they could come with it yes
[03:14] Figaroo: I see
[03:14] Aikar: but node is really more a set of tools to build things, and an smtp client is a more specific application
[03:15] desaiu has joined the channel
[03:15] dingomanatee: I find it amusing when people try to define what node is. 
[03:15] Figaroo: now, NPM is a package manager, but how are these packages registered? Is it like a network, and app store so to speak?
[03:15] dingomanatee: The problem being by implication you are saying what it is not and its a little early in teh game  for that. 
[03:15] Aikar: do you find what i said wrong? :P
[03:15] dingomanatee: Node's a programming language. 
[03:15] sadface: anyone SOO bored that they wanna help me troubleshoot a cygwin ./configure issue? :D
[03:15] dingomanatee: Like all programmiong languages, it has libraries for stuff. 
[03:15] Figaroo: Node is not a language
[03:16] Aikar: Figaroo: isaacs a dev who comes in here wrote it and maintains the registry, authors can register for his registery and submit modules to it
[03:16] dingomanatee: well it is a dialect.
[03:16] dingomanatee: you're right - language is an overstep. 
[03:16] Aikar: i prefer what i called it, "a set of tools to build things" ;)
[03:16] Figaroo: it's not at all a language dialect
[03:16] clarkfischer: sadface: I just built node in cygwin, what's up?
[03:16] Figaroo: it's a framework
[03:16] dingomanatee: my point being: you can say what libraries it has or doesn't have - right now - but that is not really a fair definition of what a young language "is". 
[03:16] Figaroo: like Cocoa or Prototype.
[03:17] Figaroo: It's not a UI framework though
[03:17] dingomanatee: (yet)
[03:17] dingomanatee: fair enough. 
[03:18] Figaroo: If one where to add modules to Node down the road in the future, Node will always remain the same, unless ryan decides to accept those modules natively.
[03:18] Ond: ...node itself is still in development
[03:18] Figaroo: even then, Node would remain a framework, so I suppose it's safe to say Node is a framework now and in the future.
[03:19] Figaroo: Aikar, what if someone else wants to use the same name as another module in the NPM registry?
[03:19] Aikar: Figaroo: then your SOL lol
[03:20] Aikar: choose a diff name :|
[03:20] Lorentz: It can't be that hard, look at debian repository, they still manage without much of name conflicts.
[03:20] Aikar: or if that module is abandoned, i believe isaacs will rename the old and let you claim the name
[03:20] Figaroo: I see, so it depends on whether or not the module in question to be replaced is still maintained.
[03:21] Figaroo: On the other hand, you still have the  ability to go out side of NPM's "network"/registry, correct?
[03:21] Aikar: yes
[03:21] Aikar: npm install http://git/url
[03:22] AAA_awright: Nodejs is giving me a segmentation fault shortly after throwing an error, right before it goes into the stack trace... It's while I'm debugging and trying to decend into a function, maybe it's trying to call a function of undefined but I can't tell for sure
[03:22] jaredstil has joined the channel
[03:24] Figaroo: Aikar, what sort of file should that URL parameter be?
[03:25] Aikar: not sure how that fully works, but mongoose listed it as: https://github.com/learnboost/mongoose/tree/1.0
[03:25] paulrobinson has joined the channel

[03:26] Aikar: https://github.com/LearnBoost/mongoose
[03:26] Aikar: it was on that page

[03:27] Figaroo: notice how it mentions node here https://github.com/LearnBoost/mongoose/blob/master/package.json

[03:50] Aikar: its a javascript implementation
[03:50] piscisaureus: ehm I mean npm
[03:52] piscisaureus: Aikar: npm relies on symlinks
[03:52] piscisaureus: not supported here
[03:52] Lorentz: npm is awesome, I just found out today
[03:52] piscisaureus: yet
[03:52] Lorentz: It was worth moving to
[03:53] dingomanatee: ReshadN: have you looked at expressJS?
[03:53] dingomanatee: Also - at the risk of being mass iggy-sticked - I would consider a hybrid Rails/Node development stack. 
[03:53] dingomanatee: Using Node to do long running business logic, data I/O and client communication and Rails as a basic foundation. 
[03:54] piscisaureus: Aikar: but thanks for the --debug-brk tip
[03:54] piscisaureus: apparently I can start `node debug`  in another console and the two end up connected together
[03:54] dingomanatee: Then as you get better at Node you can start to reduce out elements of Rails with socket/Node based stuff. 
[03:54] dingomanatee: Kind of "reverse fossilization".

[04:35] aaronblohowiak: what do you mean by shutdown?
[04:35] aaronblohowiak: SIGINT ?
[04:36] MikushiMtl: I would guess so

[04:40] iszak: MikushiMtl, shutdown the TCP server or the actual server?
[04:41] MikushiMtl: iszak: the TCP server, not the actual server
[04:42] iszak: this is node.js server, right?
[04:42] MikushiMtl: yep
[04:42] iszak: yeah, should be possible to shut it down.
[04:42] iszak: use get a child process and execute the command to shut it down.
[04:42] iszak: unless there's something in node.js to terminate it.

[04:49] MikushiMtl: iszak: got it, was quite stupid actually (sign i need to go to bed). Instead of doing net.createServer(function(socket) { }).listen(port, host); , i just declare var server; before initializing it with createServer(), then from within it's just server.close().
[04:50] iszak: MikushiMtl, that would work however, i don't think you can take that approach for restarting?

[04:51] MikushiMtl: iszak : good point
[04:52] tmzt: will the debug support listening on a unix socket?
[04:52] iszak: MikushiMtl, I would attempt to be consistent and try using a CLI based approach.
[04:52] jaredstil: does anyone know how to create a crypto.Credentials object given a PEM?  it seems to be deferring to OpenSSL whenever I call crypto.createCredentials()
[04:52] tmzt: also, will node support listening on a unjx socket with http server, for use with nginx proxy?
[04:54] jaredstil: asks for the PEM pass phrase and just blocks endlessly.
[04:56] MikushiMtl: iszak, yeah makes more sense. Then i'll just write an upstart script for it, much easier
[04:57] tmzt: MikushiMtl: you coyld talk to upstart over dbus or a socket or something

As time goes on, I'll need to update my install of Node and update my app with it. But is it not encouraged to decide to depend entirely on Node for a major web service?
[07:05] mikeal: Figaroo: so, here's the deal
[07:05] mikeal: it's going to continue to iterate and take breaking changes
[07:05] mikeal: but if you pull an even release
[07:05] mikeal: 0.2.x or 0.4.x
[07:05] mikeal: it's considered stable, and bugfix releases will continue to roll out until the next even release
[07:05] mikeal: odd releases are unstable
[07:06] mikeal: so don't take them for production
[07:06] mikeal: and only move from one stable release to the next
[07:06] Figaroo: but if say 0.2.6 has made a breaking change from 0.2.5, pulling from 0.3 later will have that same break.
[07:08] Figaroo: But I think what you're saying is, I don't need to update with all the minor releases in between. Only when there is a major release should I update, and update my app.

[07:16] mikeal: yeah, there are breaks between 0.3.1 and 0.3.4

[07:16] mikeal: for instance, 0.3.4 has no HTTPS
[07:16] mikeal: it's just gone
[07:17] mikeal: was there in 0.3.3 :)
[07:17] mikeal: but once it stabalizes and we release 0.4
[07:17] mikeal: 0.4.1 won't break anything in 0.4.0

[07:26] pquerna: Figaroo: 0.3.x is dev. somethings will get better in sub-revisions, others might break completely, there are no guarantees
[07:26] pquerna: Figaroo: in general tracking 0.3.x hasn't been too bad, things get deprecated but generally there are warnings

[07:29] TomsB: I suppose I have design flaw in my code but can't find anything good on google abotu this problem.
[07:30] mikeal: TomsB: that sounds like it's going to leak
[07:30] TomsB: why?
[07:31] mikeal: if you have references to every client you ever create then they are never going to get gc'd
[07:31] muhqu has joined the channel
[07:32] TomsB: But how then to organise all client list so that I can read ones info by e.g. clients[uid].stream ?
[07:32] mikeal: that's fine
[07:32] mikeal: just make sure you delete it on disconnect
[07:32] TomsB: oh, yes!
[07:33] TomsB: No question about that.
[07:33] TomsB: Code is not final yet :)
[07:33] mikeal: clients[uid].stream.on('end', function () { delete clients[uid] })
[07:33] Fullmoon has joined the channel
[07:34] TomsB: ok, I get this.
[07:34] TomsB: But what about this: Client.prototype.broadcast() ?
[07:34] TomsB: I should get to all client list to send info to them...
[07:35] TomsB: but if all clients is on clients[] index (on server.js) than... I can't get my head around this...
[07:35] TomsB: And I have broadcast() function on client.js from where clients[] index is not accessible..
[07:37] Figaroo: couldn't I just use 0.3.1 and update my code with each 0.3.x update? If a function gets depreciated, surely it will have a replacement.
[07:38] TomsB: I'm creating user like this: clients[data.d.uid] = new User(data.d.uid,stream); but I need to access clients[] in User.broadcast() function... grr..

[09:22] Figaroo: so I just run npm get root and that should tell me
[09:22] Pynox: I constantly get the "Build failed: task: libv8.a SConstruct -> libv8.a"
[09:22] isaacs: Figaroo: you should also run `npm help folder` and `npm help config` and read those.

[09:22] Pynox: Yes
[09:22] isaacs: Pynox: rebaseall
[09:22] Pynox: Oh, sorry for that, I should have note that xD
[09:22] isaacs: no, no problem.
[09:22] aklt: The problem is that only part of the string is decrypted.
[09:22] isaacs: it's the only platform where python doesn't work
[09:22] Pynox: Hmm, I already did that once, with a different error
[09:22] Pynox: But Ill try it x3
[09:22] isaacs: Pynox: interesting.
[09:23] isaacs: Pynox: i may be offering solutions before fully understanding the problem.

[09:23] isaacs: beware of that

[09:39] aklt: mnbvasd_: No?  On my ubuntu I see "Decode 32 bytes Here is some dat" when printing the dec1 vaiable
[09:39] mnbvasd_: aklt: oh sorry, yeah I understand.

[09:58] Figaroo: And it
[09:58] Figaroo: And they usually do a dual boot setup?
[09:58] Figaroo: Or do they just use VirtualBox?
[09:59] bzinger has joined the channel
[10:01] altamic has joined the channel
[10:04] mnbvasd_: Figaroo: it depends on the person... I just run linux at work, and linux on my servers, and macos on my home laptop.
[10:05] mnbvasd_: Figaroo: I use virtualbox to avoid having to dual boot when testing different linux distros.
[10:06] Figaroo: Well if I had the money I suppose I'd get OS X. I guess that's similar enough to linux?
[10:06] Kingdutch: Figaroo: Most people get a windows PC at first because it's the best known (either that or a mac), there's stuff linux does for me that windows can't ever do though
[10:06] devdrinker: i run mac os x on laptop for about 3 months now (got spaces/exposes all the utils setup nicely), scared when I get the desktop back next month - its quad core intel box prev 10.04 - will need to tweek it to work like os x
[10:07] Kingdutch: The problem is that Linux is aimed at users that know their way around computers a bit better than windows users, it expects you to do a lot of things yourself. You can make linux look like Win7 or Mac OS though (Although I haven't done it yet, I use the cmd line, hate the default desktop)
[10:07] Figaroo: I want to get myself familiar with linux for development purposes because I'll most likely using linux on servers I develop on.
[10:07] mnbvasd_: the only reason I can really see to run windows is for windows specific software.
[10:07] [AD]Turbo: Figaroo, my setup is windows + cygwin + nodejs + mongodb
[10:07] devdrinker: if doing stuff on CLR or need to use C#, F#, SQL server then windows
[10:08] mnbvasd_: I think it's just best off to use what you prefer.
[10:08] devdrinker: that extends to IronRuby, IronPython etc.. the DLR running on top of CLR is strong on windows than any mono implementation or DLR running on silverlight
[10:08] Kingdutch: Figaroo: What I did a few years back was (((get my parents to))) buy a simple PC (Only 1 gig of ram, boy what a mistake) athlon processor, no gfx card (Although for a desktop I recommend atleast a lower end gfx card) and I installed linux on that
[10:08] Figaroo: atm I'm using cygwin to run nodejs, like [AD]Turbo.
[10:09] Kingdutch: I just have my windows PC to do all my schoolwork etc (School has windows so that works best imo although openoffice is fine too) and I can fuck-up the linux machine in every which way possible without really being afraid of losing anything
[10:09] mnbvasd_: I just develop on my home linux server, or my mac laptop.
[10:09] Kingdutch: (Although I did reinstall two days ago while forgetting my old HD back-up of windows was on there >.>)
[10:09] Kingdutch: HDD*

[10:24] Figaroo: they both follow the FHS right?
[10:24] mnbvasd_: it's not confusing if you understand the logic ;)
[10:25] Figaroo: what is the logic, it seems like programs are scattered around everywhere, and every directory name is abbreviated...
[10:27] mnbvasd_: short dir names are legacy, and locations are standard..
[10:27] mnbvasd_: other platforms just don't have standards for placing random files around your system.
[10:27] Wizek: Hi there! I'm wondering which SQL modul is the best developed for Node, reliable and easy to use. What do you guys use, would recommend?
[10:28] Figaroo: I would think a really good file system would be more organized.
[10:29] Figaroo: Sure linux has legacy to live up to, and I'm not point the figure at linux. It just seems as though linux is still a CLI OS with a little GUI sprinkled on top
[10:31] ttpva has joined the channel
[10:32] Figaroo: anyway do you have some really, extremely good tutorials on explaining the linux file system clearly for beginners? ;P
[10:32] mAritz: Wizek: general SQL or any particular db?
[10:34] zorzar has joined the channel
[10:35] Wizek: mAritz: I also need to pick a DB... If you can recommend a database as well, that'd be fine :) (given it has great node module I can use it with...)

[10:39] naan: nothing happens when i run `node filename.js'
[10:39] Figaroo: I'll just google it then, but any resources you recommend personally to getting up to par with this?
[10:40] Kingdutch: No soryr, never really read into it, usually when I type an error msg into google though I get the answer on some ubuntuforum or another
[10:40] naan: even if i have console.log('aa') as the only line in my file
[10:40] Kingdutch: http://techbu.com/2009/06/28/linux-file-system-explained-for-beginers <-- Figaroo: It has colory pictures, looks good
[10:41] mAritz: Wizek: well, your choice of db entirely depends on your knowledge and requirements. if you want to use sql your node.js options are sqllight, mysql and postgresql (are there modules for others? i don't know)
[10:41] naan: has anybody else seen this issue? dont even know what to google to resolve this issue :)
[10:41] Kingdutch: naan, what if you just run the node interactive console?
[10:41] Figaroo: Kingdutch, thanks, I love colory picture stuff! :D

[10:43] Kingdutch: type 'node'
[10:43] Kingdutch: hit enter
[10:43] naan: newbie totally
[10:43] altamic has joined the channel
[10:44] naan: if i do that i get the error saying "argument must be a string"
[10:44] Kingdutch: What happens?
[10:44] naan: i think it expects a file name .. always
[10:44] Kingdutch: node --version for me
[10:44] Wizek: mAritz: I'm begining with SQL, so assume no knowladge. The Ideal choice for me therefore would be something that's both easy to learn (has good docs) and easy to use (one aspect of which is not to drive me crazy with insane depths of nested callbacks, handle those internaly)
[10:44] mAritz: cygwin = fail... sorry, but it's true
[10:44] naan: v0.3.4
[10:45] Kingdutch: If I type node on my linux box I get an interactive node shell that allows me to run lines of node code
[10:45] mAritz: Wizek: postgresql. if you're just learning, do it right.
[10:45] Kingdutch: such as console.log('hi');
[10:45] zorzar_ has joined the channel
[10:45] Kingdutch: Gonna have to agree with mAritz on cygwin being fail =/
[10:45] mAritz: Wizek: look at some general postgresql tutorials first.
[10:45] naan: okay .. like python and other shells
[10:45] naan: but for me on cygwin it does not do that
[10:45] naan: :(
[10:46] Wizek: mAritz: What does postgresql has to do with my learning being done right? :D
[10:46] mAritz: Wizek: https://github.com/ry/node/wiki/modules has 4 postgre modules as far as i can see
[10:46] naan: yeah .. i know .. but i have to work with this only .. no other option

[10:49] echosystm: mm
[10:50] naan: jquery and plugins provide good variety of modules
[10:50] echosystm: i find jquery ui really lacking
[10:50] naan: same here .. but no other choice ..
[10:50] echosystm: and too many basic jquery plugins just dont work, or are too hard to get working
[10:50] naan: personally i like extjs
[10:50] naan: now sencha
[10:50] echosystm: i like extjs too
[10:51] naan: but they are not commertially free
[10:51] echosystm: but my company wont shell out for licenses
[10:51] naan: :)
[10:51] echosystm: which sucks
[10:51] naan: i meant :(
[10:51] echosystm: extjs is the only library i have used that is good enough
[10:51] naan: bad luck

[10:51] naan: have you tried YUI .. they are in a way decent .. but as extensive as extjs itself

[10:52] echosystm: i looked into YUI a year ago
[10:52] echosystm: might have to give it another try

[10:52] naan: what about dojo?
[10:52] devdrinker has joined the channel
[10:53] naan: have not tried yet .. but have heard good things about it
[10:53] echosystm: dojo doesnt have many widgets in comparison to YUI and ext
[10:53] tmzt: dojos widget support is good if that what you want
[10:53] echosystm: it is a good quality library though
[10:53] tmzt: its jsonrest connected grid is awesome
[10:54] tmzt: but you can actually creat most of the functionality fairly easy in plain jquery
[10:54] echosystm: hey dojo seems to have got a huge facelift!
[10:54] tmzt: with a lot more control over your dom and style
[10:55] echosystm: i think im going to have to give dojo a decent try, it looks like it has improved a lot since i last used it
[10:56] naan: cool .. dont forget to write about it

[11:04] Figaroo: are you in the correct directory?
[11:05] naan: yeah ..i am. otherwise i get file not found error
[11:05] tmzt: no really, linux fhs and unix make sense when you really understand whats going on, for instance, some stuff is under /usr but /usr isnt always mounted so its neccessary for some basic binaries and libraries to be under /bin /sbin /lib etc.
[11:05] naan: command just gets finished .. but no output
[11:06] naan: even though i have console.log statement
[11:06] tmzt: naan: finished? it depends on what the js file does, but it only prints if you have a log statement in it
[11:07] naan: tmzt: finished means .. runs without errors .. i had written a http server .. which used to run on 2.6
[11:07] sriley: had 0.3 running on my windows machine via cygwin, was working, computer is dead atm though

[11:20] Figaroo: tmzt, yeah but for less than the same price I get 10TB
[11:21] unsoughtDesire: The documentation for node-mysql-libmysqlclient seems more organized.
[11:21] Figaroo: actually from the looks of it every one of their options is 10TB, strange.
[11:22] unsoughtDesire: In terms of VPSes, I've been VERY happy with my Linode.
[11:22] Figaroo: I'm not sure how much 10TB could support

[11:55] Kingdutch: Euh, yeh, the matching works fine
[11:55] sveimac has joined the channel
[11:56] Kingdutch: First pair of parenthesis which should be 13.21 should be variable 1 and the 2nd var should be .21

[11:57] ttpva: is it possible to use coffeescript instead of JS for node.js ?
[11:58] Kingdutch: Boo, no, it's the way regexp work, everything in brackets gets assigned to a var
[11:58] mraleph: ttpva: npm install coffee-script
[11:58] Kingdutch: Why can't you just pull 12.333 from the third variable?
[11:58] ttpva: mraleph: but does it replace JS totally ?
[11:58] mraleph: ttpva: what do you mean by totally?
[11:58] Kingdutch: No JS needed
[11:58] Kingdutch: Just write coffeescript
[11:59] Kingdutch: means totally
[11:59] under_: you prob want something like ([\d.]+), ([\d.]+), ([\d.]+), ([\d.]+)  
[11:59] ttpva: can I use coffeescript (ruby) to create a complete node.js software?
[11:59] ttpva: ok
[11:59] under_: you'll have to get escaping corrct
[11:59] mraleph: you can write in pure coffeescript and launch it like coffee app.coffee instead of node app.js
[12:00] mraleph: but of course JS will remain hidden inside :-)
[12:00] Kingdutch: under_: He's probably using something like 'regex here' in which case the escaping is correct because i.e. '\\' = \ and '\\\\' = \\
[12:00] ttpva: ok, nice. thanks
[12:01] Kingdutch: y'd you want coffee instead of javascript?
[12:01] mraleph: cause javascript is too much boilerplate?
[12:03] under_: cause coffeescript is really nice to write.  especially if you are used to python 
[12:04] Kingdutch: http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/ <-- Shit's biased no need for the var decs at the top
[12:04] Kingdutch: number = 42 can just be var number = 42

[12:05] Kingdutch: Also, formatting one size with comments nicely and not the other is just, meh

[12:31] stagas: it should break on another line
[12:31] Kingdutch: stagas it's outputting till line 501 though

[12:33] Kingdutch: Just some random page or is it looping the samep age?
[12:34] Wizek_: stagas: moving caused the same error: cut off at line 500
[12:35] Wizek_: Kingdutch: it's simple HTML. It has some reoccuring elements there which is there because of the nature of the app I'm building
[12:35] stagas: Wizek_: really weird. node --version ?
[12:35] Wizek_: but it is stored in an html file
[12:36] Kingdutch: Wizek_: I mean, when it wraps around at 0, is that a different page? Is it the same page starting at the top again?
[12:36] Wizek_: stagas: v0.3.1
[12:37] Wizek_: Kingdutch: it's the same page, and actually it is served till the end at the second time (line 537)
[12:37] Wizek_: so the sum of 1038 (including line 0) is being served
[12:38] Wizek_: but the wierdest thig is how can the line counter be reset within the middle of the file, as it is calculated client side and not transmitted as I know...
[12:38] Kingdutch: Sounds like a bug in express where it's maybe serving block by block as it reads from disk and then the entire file at once when it's finished

[15:27] shaver: it is always nice when someone has a simple solution to your problmes
[15:27] shaver: and it's very common on IRC, one of my favourite things about it
[15:28] shaver: rn: you know what you should do about your problem? just don't have that problem!
[15:28] brianc: so I think someone yesterday in here was implying it was bad strict mode was being added to v8. was I just misreading or is it bad for some reason?
[15:28] bradleymeck: rn are you trying to work on local fs or just want node to do some random stuff?
[15:28] bradleymeck: brianc I am against strict mode
[15:28] bradleymeck: so you read right
[15:29] bradleymeck: only thing im for in strict mode is removing arguments.callee
[15:29] shaver: what don't you like about strict mode?
[15:29] rn: bradleymeck: random stuff, like zombie.js
[15:29] bradleymeck: it breaks code
[15:29] shaver: (wondering if it's the same stuff I don't like)
[15:29] bradleymeck: as a side effect
[15:29] shaver: well, it breaks code if that code opts in to it
[15:29] bradleymeck: no
[15:29] shaver: how so?
[15:29] bradleymeck: if and strict mode code accesses non-strict code it breaks if rules are broken
[15:29] bradleymeck: any*
[15:30] shaver: can you give an example?
[15:30] brianc: basically if any script turns strict mode "on" all the scripts are checked against strict mode
[15:30] shaver: non-strict functions called from strict ones shouldn't be subject to stricture
[15:30] brianc: ?
[15:30] hobodave has joined the channel
[15:30] shaver: brianc: I don't believe that to be the case at all
[15:30] brianc: my statement was missing the critical piece of punctuation which would change it into a question
[15:30] shaver: ah
[15:30] shaver: yes, in which case a shorter response would have been "no"
[15:31] brianc: haha
[15:31] bradleymeck: function foo(){"use strict";bar()};function bar(){console.log(arguments.callee)}
[15:31] bradleymeck: bar will work outside of foo
[15:31] bradleymeck: bar will die inside of foo
[15:31] shaver: ah, I see
[15:31] shaver: access to strict-mode stuff
[15:31] shaver: but you like the callee removal
[15:31] shaver: so are there other examples?
[15:31] bradleymeck: so if you have a factory function any thing wrapping your stuff, it may just blow up without your knowledge
[15:32] shaver: like, this-coercion isn't there
[15:33] shaver: like
[15:33] bradleymeck: so even "if" you could have a faster more optimal etc non-strict version by using runtime codegen (Function/eval), it will fail, so you must test for strict mode if you want to optimize because strict mode may stop your optimization
[15:33] shaver: function foo() { "use strict"; return [this, bar()] } function bar() { return this; }
[15:33] shaver: gives [undefined, ((Global object))]
[15:34] shaver: direct eval inside a use-strict function is strict, but that's the code in question opting in to it
[15:34] prettyrobots has joined the channel
[15:34] shaver: I think arguments.callee-ectomy is worth the breakage for that specific case
[15:35] bradleymeck: true, but the fact is it is an unknown side effect to the function being called, which is why im against it, so if you prototype something in strict and it is extended w/ non-strict it dies
[15:35] bradleymeck: strict mode encourages strict or die policies
[15:35] shaver: you could have that unknown side-effect from a getter that throws, too
[15:35] shaver: any time you touch an object that you don't know about, you have to be defensive (or just let it break you if that's its intent, which is often just fine)
[15:36] bradleymeck: the question is why are you running code you dont know about
[15:36] shaver: hmm?
[15:36] bradleymeck: thats the point of avoiding eval
[15:36] shaver: you're running a library
[15:36] shaver: jQuery can opt into strict without its clients needing to
[15:36] bradleymeck: if you dont trust the lib why are you running it
[15:36] shaver: and vice versa
[15:37] rn: so i installed scons-1.3.1, ripped out scons-local-1.2.0 and tweaked scons invocations.  make now fails with Build failed: -> missing file: 'C:\\MinGW\\msys\\1.0\\home\\roman\\wc\\node-v0.3.4\\build\\default\\libv8.a'
[15:37] bradleymeck: i see what people want, but i dont see what they get besides restrictions, if you want to get more complicated injection attacks still work in strict mode
[15:37] shaver: I don't think it's an issue of "trust" for arguments.callee (a painful security issue for objcap systems) to disappear
[15:37] bradleymeck: callee wasnt really an issue arguments.caller was
[15:37] rn: and before that: scons: warning: Ignoring missing SConscript 'obj\test\release\SConscript'
[15:37] shaver: oh, sorry
[15:38] shaver: yes, OK, sorry, let me start over
[15:38] rn: File "C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\home\roman\wc\node-v0.3.4\deps\v8\SConstruct", line 1109, in BuildSpecific
[15:38] shaver: I *don't* like .callee being elided
[15:38] bradleymeck: callee is not a security issue* 
[15:38] shaver: it's being done to clear the path for ES6 "this function" sort of construct, I think
[15:38] slaskis: anyone here used fugue? or maybe wrote it?
[15:39] bradleymeck: shaver no, just name your function
[15:39] bradleymeck: thats their goal it seems right now
[15:40] bradleymeck: i mean having a this construct on a function that is already accessible by name would be kinda redundant
[15:41] ehaas has joined the channel
[15:41] shaver: I wonder if TC-39 wrote up anything summarizing the reasons for each stricture
[15:41] shaver: that would be valuable
[15:43] bradleymeck: it probably is somewhere
[15:45] bradleymeck: now if strict mode had affected an entire page rather than the gobbly gook its going to put on figuring out if you are under strict mode, id be ok. cause until that occurs i can make crud do terrible things even in strict mode, just makes me have to write a bit more
[15:45] ringomanatee: Is there any clean way to reduce an array to a unique set? values = strings.
[15:46] bradleymeck: v8: [1,2,3,4,5,5,6,4,3,2,2,2].filter(function(item,index,arr){return arr.indexOf(item)==index})
[15:46] v8bot: bradleymeck: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
[15:46] Yuffster has joined the channel

[15:48] unlink: If I run it with a big file, node seems to hold the whole file in RAM (based on top). However, if I don't hold on to a reference to "fs", that behavior seems to go away, and node has nominal memory usage.
[15:48] bradleymeck: unlink, whats interesting, without cacheing it probably blows up high then down low
[15:49] EyePulp has joined the channel
[15:49] bradleymeck: dont hold a reference to fs?
[15:49] unlink: bradleymeck: actually it stays high (~2x the size of the file)
[15:50] bradleymeck: interesting, *goes to check something*
[15:50] unlink: that's fine for this case, but what if I want to use other things than readFile in my application?
[15:51] bradleymeck: well generally i dont load a whole file into ram like that
[15:51] bradleymeck: so i think thats true for most ppl here, so going to look if something is stuck on an object

[17:13] Kingdutch: Not sure could be
[17:13] Kingdutch: What can we help you with today?
[17:13] tmzt: fille12: if you went to #nodejs it should have told you to come here

[17:14] sepehr has joined the channel
[17:14] fille12: tmzt: and i followed it
[17:14] Kingdutch: I'm thinking of just sending the requested page with some JS that'll take over navigation

[17:17] Kingdutch: I guess it's what most people wanna figure out with node to get pretty nav
[17:18] Kingdutch: Well, # + HTML5 can make forward/back work
[17:18] Kingdutch: It's just what to serve as index

[17:22] fille12: just wondering is it possible to deploy node.js on appache or is it just a seperete socket server
[17:23] fille12: was that a silky question? :D
[17:23] Kingdutch: right I wandered off, you also need to send non-js users the right page without JS
[17:24] Kingdutch: That was a silly question, although I've learned bad questions don't exist, only bad answers so here goes.

[17:24] Kingdutch: node.js can replace apache although they don't really serve the same goal
[17:25] curtisc has joined the channel
[17:25] Kingdutch: node.js is here to run your JavaScript scripts which could be anything you want, a mail server, a web server (like apache), an irc server, etc. or a combination of these things in one node process (that's the power of the event loop)
[17:25] Aria has joined the channel
[17:25] Kingdutch: Apache is just one thing, a thread based webserver which serves web-content (And through modules can also serve things like php), it's a different thing.

[17:42] isaacs: (re: no.de plans to recognize package.json)
[17:43] Kingdutch: gekko27: I'd try a newer version
[17:43] Kingdutch: isaacs: package.json?
[17:43] xSmurf: ACTION is watching the 27C3 nodejs talk
[17:43] isaacs: Kingdutch: yeah
[17:43] Kingdutch: What's package.json
[17:43] isaacs: Kingdutch: package.json is the file you use to tell npm what your package looks like
[17:43] blueadept has joined the channel
[17:43] Kingdutch: xSmurf: Ah, good talk that is :)
[17:43] isaacs: Kingdutch: npm help json
[17:43] Kingdutch: Ah I see
[17:44] isaacs: it's one of the main interfaces to npm, how you get it to do stuff with your codez
[17:44] xSmurf: Kingdutch: sounds like it, just started it
[17:44] isaacs: npm favors configuration over convention.
[17:44] isaacs: because javascript is for anarchists
[17:44] gekko27: brianc: just tried that, same symptoms - node simply does nothing
[17:44] brianc: gekko27: okay...might want to try with the latest 0.2.x tag
[17:45] brianc: gekko27: try building that. i believe it's 0.2.6
[17:45] xSmurf: isaacs: nice imma steal that one :P
[17:45] Kingdutch: brianc: How does reverting to 0.2 help? =/
[17:45] gekko27: brianc: great thanks, I'll give that a shot...
[17:45] isaacs: xSmurf: JUST LIKE A JAVASCRIPTER!
[17:45] xSmurf: lol
[17:45] Kingdutch: isaacs: I'm gonna remember that convention and use it for my project, config over convention seemsn ice
[17:45] isaacs: xSmurf: cuz, ya know, we just scrape the interwebz.  we don't do any *real* coding
[17:45] brianc: Kingdutch: might be a more stable branch? more likey to work under cygwin?
[17:45] isaacs: Kingdutch: the only convention is to use a package.json to define it
[17:45] Kingdutch: Yeh ok, point taken
[17:46] xSmurf: isaacs: of course, copy paste is not how things are programmed? :P
[17:46] brianc: Kingdutch: not sure though, maybe has to do w/ the way cygwin setup. i decided it'd be easier to get a linode & putty rather than go cygwin route so my experience is limited. :)
[17:47] Kingdutch: Yeh I just got a seperate linux box with putty as well

[18:01] xSmurf: Kingdutch: lol
[18:01] mgutz: XRegExp !
[18:01] EyePulp: Kingdutch: I know in django the ORM has a pretty robust method for easily swapping db's but that's a pretty complex bit of tech, and I don't think anyone's made that push in under node yet.
[18:02] halfhalo: or I can call just regex.match which runs through all created regex objects by the master object
[18:03] Kingdutch: EyePulp: All it really requires is for the calls in your project to be agnostic
[18:03] brianc: Kingdutch: I'm not sure of one either, though I tried to loosely base the API of node-postgres on felixge's node-mysql 
[18:03] Kingdutch: Just let a seperate class handle translation to a specific database

[18:04] EyePulp: Ok. =)
[18:04] tmzt: Kingdutch: what Im doing is serving either the full page as a jade template with the normal url
[18:04] Kingdutch: jade?
[18:05] brianc: Kingdutch: which server?
[18:05] tmzt: yeah its a language that compresses html down into tab spaced trees
[18:05] tmzt: and can run javascript inline
[18:05] tmzt: (on the server)

[18:06] brianc: Kingdutch: if I go off of IRC you know you wrecked my shit
[18:06] tmzt: so I'm always serving the same page, but if they use the full url they get the contents of that url put in the div on the server side
[18:06] Kingdutch: tmzt: Oh hmm interesting, but yeh how do you distinguish?
[18:06] Kingdutch: Ooh I see
[18:07] tmzt: if they use the js/sammy client then I internally request /ajax/whatever instead of #whatever
[18:07] Kingdutch: Right
[18:07] tmzt: although I'm considering using client side templates with sammy
[18:07] Kingdutch: so what do oyu do if someone lands on a page at like yoursite.com/#something
[18:07] gekko27: make install

[18:09] tmzt: if they just use / I give them index.jade
[18:09] brianc: gekko27: awesomeness

[18:10] amerine has joined the channel
[18:10] gekko27: brianc: cheers for that, now to learn what this node business is
[18:10] Kingdutch: Since the server will get the yoursite.com/ request, but the user wants #something
[18:10] Kingdutch: brianc: We should report 0.3 fails for cygwin though
[18:11] tmzt: hey syntax sugar question about async, would it be valid syntax to have a series of async calls in sequence but just suspend the whole function, as in could this be tranlated to the evented concept used by node?
[18:11] sandymahalo has joined the channel
[18:11] brianc: gekko27: no worries. would recommend sticking to the v0.2.x branch for cygwin as v0.3.x branch is unstable

[18:13] tmzt: or a hidden iframe
[18:13] Kingdutch: No I mean the last page they visited wasn't your site
[18:13] Kingdutch: Like the user clicked a bookmark to yoursite.com/#something
[18:13] bradleymeck: tmzt continuations are not in v8 or node, but even if we had them they cause some concurrency issues that would probably need semaphores and would mean holding separate stacks in memory

[18:20] Kingdutch: That was actually a copy paste from this morning when I had to generate 2000 lines of output to test something, xchat just delays long pastes to avoid flooding out
[18:21] Kingdutch: Which usually for a 10 line paste that I actually want in here is fine
[18:21] warz: well, for the record, websockets do appear to work cross-domain.
[18:21] mscdex: warz: they always have

[18:26] v8bot:  pquerna has given a beer to twillio. twillio now has 1 beers.
[18:26] mscdex: i spent the last three weeks giving node-ncurses some love. everything is much better now
[18:26] mscdex: :>
[18:27] tmzt: SIP has very little to do with the media interface or whatever
[18:27] brianc: Kingdutch: depends on a large number of factors, but for a 512 meg linode, maybe check it against the same style app using rack or sinatra
[18:27] tmzt: whether a splice() for node would work I don't know
[18:27] tmzt: or something that can handle binary protocols efficiently
[18:27] slaskis: hmm, writing a connect middleware is a bit tricky
[18:27] softdrink: mscdex:  256 colors?
[18:28] slaskis: i'm making a jsonp middleware, but it keeps complaining that i have to call writeHead before write...
[18:28] tmzt: slaskis: blame http

[18:29] piscisaureu_ has joined the channel
[18:30] Kingdutch: brianc That counter you got on there is gonna go up by about a million though
[18:30] tmzt: slaskis: you generally have to send a repsonse line and header before data
[18:30] bradleymeck: is atexit guaranteed even if you kill a process?
[18:30] brianc: Kingdutch: sweet
[18:30] tmzt: bradleymeck: if it gets a signal, so KILL probably not
[18:31] softdrink: mscdex:  does node-ncurses' colorPair support 256 color terminal mode?
[18:31] tmzt: otherwise read the libc info pages
[18:31] Kingdutch: brianc: It's running
[18:31] brianc: here we go!
[18:31] slaskis: tmzt: hah, yeah well i agree with that part, but if i only want to modify the body of the response i'm wrapping the res.write function as i've seen other middlewares do. but then it complains about writeHead, but i havn't even touched it...
[18:31] brianc: like i said if i get kicked off...you defeated me
[18:32] mscdex: softdrink: it should support however many colors the terminal supports
[18:32] Kingdutch: Guys I figured out that any static http server in node will crash if it hits a certain number of user requests at the same time (between 100-1000)
[18:32] Kingdutch: atleast 0.3.5-pre does
[18:32] tmzt: slaskis: not sure is there some other callback you should handle first?
[18:32] Kingdutch: which isn't really a good way to handle DoS attacks
[18:32] mgutz: brianc: node+connect outperforms sinatra by a good margin on small vps

[18:33] tmzt: is there monogoose or another orm with an associated middleware for json get/put/post?
[18:33] brianc: Kingdutch: my web server is also running my irc client & database and other stuff
[18:34] Kingdutch: If something crashes/hangs it should just be node
[18:34] Kingdutch: unless node is also your irc client
[18:34] Kingdutch: you should be ok
[18:34] brianc: Kingdutch: w0rd
[18:34] mscdex: i also started on a spiffier irc client that uses node-ncurses
[18:34] mscdex: :D
[18:34] tmzt: if ab on localhost a good baseline?
[18:34] tmzt: is
[18:34] Kingdutch: Gonna take some time though, not even at 100000 requests 
[18:34] mscdex: this one supports multiple windows and stuff this time
[18:35] Kingdutch: tmzt: Dunnoy, I did it over my lan, it's a good way to test how long the server takes to handle the request
[18:35] Kingdutch: Just factor in a little network latency
[18:35] brianc: Kingdutch: yah maybe could just do 100,000 requests. probably get the same statistics
[18:35] Kingdutch: brianc: Wouldn't be as fun though
[18:35] brianc: Kingdutch: node is takine 1% of the cpu and 3 megs of ram
[18:35] tmzt: Im on a vps and my uplink isnt enough to adequately test
[18:35] perlmonkey2: I thought the node docs say writeHead must be called before res.end, but that you can call write before writeHead?
[18:36] tmzt: also, Im going to have to emulate twilio for some of the test
[18:36] Kingdutch: brianc: That's not too bad, is it?
[18:36] dtrasbo has joined the channel
[18:36] tmzt: that's going to be fun, I think I'll need another instance
[18:36] bradleymeck: perlmonkey2 you shouldnt write before writeHead
[18:37] brianc: Kingdutch: sorry 3% of ram, not 3megs. i have 512megs of ram
[18:37] Kingdutch: If you don't call writehead before res.end for some odd reason it outputs undefined
[18:37] Kingdutch: Which imo is very bad
[18:37] tmzt: outputs undefined?
[18:37] Kingdutch: Try it
[18:37] tmzt: bradleymeck: the http client is basically raw?
[18:37] tmzt: er
[18:37] tmzt: server
[18:37] dguttman has joined the channel
[18:37] bradleymeck: basically
[18:38] Kingdutch: Just close a request after you get it without doing anythign else
[18:38] tmzt: how is Content-Length handled?
[18:38] brianc: Kingdutch: I'll touch base later, gotta do some w0rk
[18:38] bradleymeck: it doesnt buffer it by default so it doesnt get sent?
[18:38] perlmonkey2: Kingdutch: well that makes sense.  you can't send the response without a response header.
[18:38] bradleymeck: its up to you to use a library or something if you want that automated
[18:38] perlmonkey2: and res.end sends the response.
[18:38] ossareh has joined the channel
[18:39] tmzt: I assume I'd be looking at Buffer if I wanted to find out
[18:39] perlmonkey2: and I guess res.write starts writing to the response's stream, so I guess you have to call writeHead to call write.  Would have swore the docs said otherwise though.
[18:39] Kingdutch: perlmonkey2: IMO, if I do res.end() before writing anything to the stream, node shouldn't do anything either, writing "undefined" to the stream is just bad behaviour
[18:39] tmzt: by the way, is there anything lighter than nginx that would work over a unix socket and just handle Host: ?
[18:40] Kingdutch: I'd rather have a blank screen than "undefined"
[18:40] tmzt: Kingdutch: read some rfcs
[18:40] tmzt: and where do you see 'undefined'?
[18:40] Kingdutch: in the client

[18:45] tmzt: thats what happens when you leave out .end()
[18:45] perlmonkey2: otherwise how would the client know to not wait for a response?  it will have to time out.

[20:58] rwhitby: ryah: and the fact that all the webOS internal services will now be even more hackable to our group due to being written in visible source node.js is pretty good too :)
[20:58] aelaguiz: except keys aren't ordered based on insert order
[20:58] EyePulp: object has no sense of order

[22:18] fission6: does anyone run a productionw eb app by simply doing node somewebapp.js or is there more to serving the web app
[22:18] EyePulp: it's a live-chat system for about 10,000 agents to handle an unknown number of customers.
[22:18] tmzt: mayeb with node-canvas? this is getting fun
[22:18] EyePulp: though whether all 10,000 will ever use it is a big unknown
[22:19] fission6: illl load test it for 10,000 dollars
[22:19] EyePulp: heh
[22:19] maushu: EyePulp, they will, and they will call their friends.
[22:19] maushu: All their friends.
[22:19] tmzt: EyePulp: chat being text only?
[22:19] fission6: i assume the front end is web based? or is there a native GUI
[22:19] EyePulp: tmzt: si
[22:19] EyePulp: fission6: web based
[22:19] EyePulp: socket.io 
[22:19] fission6: what are you using for the backend
[22:19] fission6: for accounts and the like
[22:19] tmzt: EyePulp: ive been working on something so freaking cool I cant even put it into words
[22:20] EyePulp: node/mongo

[22:20] tmzt: EyePulp: like, uh why didnt we think of this cool
[22:20] fission6: anyone here in nyc?
[22:21] EyePulp: *but* I'm concerned about socket.io's connection dropping
[22:21] EyePulp: tmzt: what's that?
[22:21] fission6: why wouldnt they drop on this service vs any other software 
[22:21] tmzt: you work with big ecommerce sites?
[22:21] tmzt: companies
[22:21] maushu: EyePulp, what transport is it using by default?
[22:22] EyePulp: fission6: you mean why use this when there's 1,000 other chat solutions out there?
[22:22] MikhX has joined the channel
[22:22] tmzt: EyePulp: my sad experience with netsol over the last few days reminded me why they need this
[22:22] EyePulp: maushu: the rep side connected with the flashsocket, and I think the demo customer side connected with xhr-poling.
[22:22] fission6: no i mean why would socket.io drop out from its node implementation vs any other socket implementation
[22:23] fission6: maushu: ryah - 3.1 works and 3.2 craps out, thats as fine as I can track it
[22:23] fission6: should i report this
[22:23] fission6: and if so how

[22:29] fission6: and its actually there something just stepped on its foot between 3.1 and 3.4
[22:29] maushu: EyePulp, hes talking about client side.
[22:29] fission6: err 3.2
[22:30] maushu: fission6, give some spaces between code, 4 I believe, to put it into a code box.
[22:30] maushu: *before each line of code
[22:30] fission6: maybe i will review at some point and try to fix, how can i get push priv

[22:59] ecto: i kick it out with console.log and res.send
[22:59] ecto: it always shows up in the console but after the 5th view it stops the server stops responding to http traffic

[23:08] kkaefer: is there a way in javascript to use non-standard utf-8 encoding of ascii characters?
[23:08] kkaefer: i.e. multiple bytes to represent something that could be represented as plain ascii?
[23:08] ecto: after the 3rd or 4th pageload it will console.log(String(bookings.length)) but stops replying to http requests
[23:09] kkaefer: like \xC0\xAF is a slash character
[23:09] mjr_: ecto: which redis client are you using?
[23:09] kkaefer: (I understand it's invalid utf-8)
[23:09] creationix has joined the channel
[23:10] mjr_: kkaefer: you could use String.fromCharCode(num) to assemble a new String from bytes.

[23:11] mjr_: That's cool, ryah.

[23:13] Tprice: does the server have "Event: 'data'"
[23:13] Tprice: or just the client?
[23:13] brianc: Tprice: both server and client
[23:14] brianc: Tprice: this info is available in the node documentation as well

[23:16] Tprice: socket would be net.createServer
[23:16] brianc: Tprice: server should raise some sorta "connect" event which will pass you a net.Stream of the incomming connection or something like that. that stream will raise a 'data' event

[23:18] mjr_: ecto: and your try/catch won't actually catch things inside that second query because the stack has unwound by then.  That's why you need to check for err.

[23:47] mjr_: Who better?
[23:47] creationix: how is thrift compared to msgpack?
[23:47] broofa: mjr_:  yeah, specially since Mark Slee sits right behind me.  :P
[23:49] broofa: creationix: I haven't perf-tested msgpack, but I know it's written to be fast.  And my first experiments with node-thrift are turning up less-than-stellar performance.
[23:49] creationix: broofa: cool, thanks
[23:50] broofa: creationix: I'd say unless you need to talk to thrift services, msgpack is probably a better choice for basic object transport.  But bear in mind that it's not an RPC protocol the way thrift or json-rpc is.
[23:50] skm has joined the channel
[23:50] sinisa: creationix.. im just dl your haml.js :)
[23:50] robotarmy has joined the channel
[23:51] creationix: not that I want an rpc, but I thought msgpack had one
[23:51] broofa: ... so if it's rpc you're after, you'll need to add some housekeeping code on top there.
[23:51] creationix: just not in the core protocol
[23:51] creationix: I just want super effecient json over the wire
[23:51] creationix: + buffers
[23:51] broofa: msgpack.
[23:51] skm has joined the channel
[23:51] creationix: the only problem with msgpack is that you can't tell the difference between buffers and strings

[23:52] creationix: no way to specify encoding

[23:54] warz: im new to nodejs in general, and am wondering how well does socket.io scale? from my understanding, it opens a socket for every client session, somehow. how would this scale and handle 100 concurrent users, or 1000, or more?
[23:54] ryah: isaacs: why does there have to be a library for globs?
[23:54] ryah: isaacs: it's probably just part of zsh..
[23:54] isaacs: ryah: that may be
[23:54] creationix: warz, 1000 is nothing
[23:54] paulrobinson has joined the channel
[23:54] mwilliams_ has joined the channel
[23:54] isaacs: ryah: but ruby uses it, i think
[23:55] creationix: but 10,000 starts to matter
[23:55] creationix: depends on hardware and os
[23:55] isaacs: ryah: there's also a perl extension for it
[23:55] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[23:55] sinisa: creationix.. mac mem usage cap will be?
[23:55] warz: creationix, but lets assume the upper boundary is being reached - is there a clear way to scale this horizontally?
[23:55] sinisa: mac=max 
[23:55] pquerna: warz: i'd suggest benchmarking your use case, but 1000s++ is generally fine
[23:55] creationix: sinisa: I think it's either 1gb or 2gb, not sure
[23:55] creationix: sinisa: and node buffers don't count in this limit
[23:55] creationix: I've allocated 16gm of buffers once
[23:56] ryah: isaacs: 
[23:56] creationix: (when load testing my infinite game map engine)
[23:56] ryah: 0 0 ~/src/zsh-4.3.10 : egrep -i "glob\>" configure.ac 
[23:56] ryah: 0 1 ~/src/zsh-4.3.10 : find .  | grep glob
[23:56] ryah: ./Src/glob.c
[23:56] sinisa: so it will "eat" it until reaches 1gb?
[23:56] warz: ok, i dont think ill reach 1000 concurrent users any time soon, or ever. lol. but i just like thinking into the future, i guess.
[23:56] creationix: sinisa: it gc's long before it hits that
[23:56] isaacs: ryah: yeah, downloading now.  gonna see how they do it.
[23:56] sinisa: creationix.. im using it on windows...
[23:56] pquerna: re: scalling horizontally, there isnt a ton of structure in node to help you do that directly, other than it being easy to write networked apps in it -- and it has things like AMQP libraries
[23:57] creationix: warz: yeah, node scales really nice with concurrent connections, they add very little overhead
[23:57] creationix: it's your actual work per user that would make most the difference
[23:58] ryah: warz: doesn't scale beyond one core
[23:58] warz: cool. right now i just have nodejs dedicated to handing socket.io connections. my user facing site is just being served up by nginx.
