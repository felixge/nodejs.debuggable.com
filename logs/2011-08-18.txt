[00:49] _storrgie_ has joined the channel
[00:49] kmiyashiro: so they're just text files?
[00:50] tbranyen: thats actually my preferred method
[00:50] tbranyen: sure
[00:50] tbranyen: some people like to use script tags with illegal type attributes so they are loaded with the page
[00:50] tbranyen: but thats just not my thang
[00:50] kmiyashiro: so you'd do something like _.template(file)

[00:52] tbranyen: yeah its a novel idea, i was working on something similar
[00:52] insin: Mine is Django-derivative too. Can't get enough of those blocks!

[00:58] Xanderby: so, this is going to sound nuts but does anyone know of any tool or package that would allow me to include a PHP or Ruby class (JIT recompilation, glue code, IPC, something) in node.js?
[00:58] tbranyen: Xanderby: you could shell out to it
[00:58] Nuck: Xanderby: Why would you want that?
[00:58] Xanderby: tbranyen: ideally it would be performant 
[00:59] mikeal has joined the channel
[00:59] Xanderby: Nuck: I want to turn my PHP framework into a language agnostic framework 
[00:59] Xanderby: with bootloaders in each language
[00:59] Xanderby: and interoperability between each
[00:59] Xanderby: depending on how a dev wants to deploy
[00:59] Nuck: Xanderby: ... Then rewrite it in Node?
[00:59] Nuck: If you want it to be in all languages, you should probably either make it in all languages
[00:59] tbranyen: Xanderby: noble goal, but i think foolish tbh
[01:00] tbranyen: these languages work very differently
[01:00] Xanderby: Nuck: to clarify, I don't want to port the entire framework 
[01:00] Nuck: Or use a nice "Least Common Denominator" (i.e. use C or C++)
[01:00] tbranyen: :D
[01:00] Xanderby: I want the bootloaders and autoloaders to be interoperable 
[01:00] Xanderby: think .NET
[01:00] dgathright_ has left the channel
[01:00] Nuck: bootloaders?
[01:00] Xanderby: yes

[01:50] int_64: Penentration test results, etc?
[01:50] ryah: int_64: no
[01:50] int_64: okkkk
[01:50] int_64: so what does a person do to get confidence in node.js?
[01:50] int_64: Run his own pentests?
[01:50] ryah: depends on one's expectations :)
[01:50] int_64: heh
[01:50] ryah: hire a security auditor
[01:51] int_64: Well I dont know anything about node.js except it uses a lnaguage that I like to use.
[01:51] int_64: I cant build a site for a client if there are some gaping holes in it
[01:51] int_64: hire a security auditor :p
[01:51] int_64: heh
[01:51] ryah: there are no security holes that we know of
[01:51] ryah: :)
[01:51] tjholowaychuk: int_64 it's more likely that you'll personally expose a whole than node
[01:51] int_64: ok..
[01:51] eboyjr: security is in the hands of the programmer

[01:51] ryah: yes

[01:52] int_64: Servers can be exploited
[01:52] int_64: ryah : ok heh

[01:52] ryah: int_64: bugs are found often
[01:52] int_64: ok
[01:52] eboyjr: okay i spoke too soon

[01:52] int_64: just curious
[01:53] bluesmoon has joined the channel
[01:53] ryah: but as i said - no security bugs that we know of..
[01:53] int_64: ok thanks
[01:53] tbranyen: compared to the other options i wouldn't hesistate to wager that node is the most secure xD
[01:53] int_64: ryah, do any major corporations run node.js?
[01:53] jerrysv: int_64: the interpreter is v8
[01:53] int_64: tbranyen, really? why do you say that?
[01:53] ryah: int_64: some
[01:53] inimino: tbranyen ⋱ Compared to mature software like Apache httpd?
[01:53] tbranyen: int_64: because i have no idea what i'm talking about
[01:53] tmzt: linkedin is running mobile off of it now
[01:54] jerrysv: yahoo is hiring for it
[01:54] tbranyen: inimino: tbh don't those get hammered with exploits since they're so popular?
[01:54] int_64: tmzt, nice!
[01:54] int_64: thats good enough for me
[01:54] tbranyen: makes them a nicer target
[01:54] jerrysv: i hear there's some sort of OS using it, something from a small company called HP
[01:54] int_64: ok ok
[01:54] int_64: I get it :)
[01:54] inimino: tbranyen ⋱ Bugs tend to decline over time, I'd guess node.js has more exploitable holes than software of similar size that is older.
[01:54] tmzt: that isn't exactly exposed to the internet
[01:54] tmzt: as a server
[01:54] tbranyen: inimino: yeah it'd be pretty incredible if it didn't
[01:54] tbranyen: actually i think it was talked about at defcon
[01:55] jerrysv: inimino: but that also depends on how easy it is to do something stupid
[01:55] tbranyen: some xss style attacks or something
[01:55] SubStack: HP is that hot new calculator startup down in palo alto I think
[01:55] zilch has joined the channel
[01:55] jerrysv: eg: php and globals
[01:55] c4milo1: how did mention xss? 
[01:55] jerrysv: substack: i thought they did printers
[01:55] tmzt: but a large amount of code is written in js, hard to get things like formatting string validations issues there
[01:55] SubStack: node makes for a pretty good calculator
[01:55] tbranyen: SubStack: for serious
[01:55] isaacs: inimino: i'm not convinced of any such tendency
[01:56] tbranyen: super+n is node for me and then boom maths
[01:56] isaacs: inimino: in my experience, bugs quite often increase or remain constant over time.
[01:56] ryah: SubStack: unless you go over 53 bits:)
[01:56] tmzt: could node.js work entirly without globals?
[01:56] int_64: ryah, this might be answerabl;e by viewing the web ppage, but Il.l ask you anyway...
[01:56] soapyillusions has joined the channel
[01:56] tmzt: like make the global context read only
[01:56] ryah: int_64: shoot
[01:56] int_64: Is there any deeper server-client connection  by using node.js than some other server lang, except for the fact they share syntax and semantics?
[01:56] jerrysv: substack can answer that one :)
[01:57] int_64: Like are there methodlologies that a node.js coder uses, that simply cant be done in any other  platform?
[01:57] ryah: int_64: no
[01:57] isaacs: int_64: the http boundary is exactly the same for everyone.
[01:57] int_64: gotcha
[01:57] int_64: thanks
[01:57] isaacs: int_64: but having the same syntax and language is huge.
[01:57] SubStack: ryah: but at least we have bigint!
[01:57] isaacs: int_64: there's a library SubStack wrote called "browserify" that can convert your node programs to run client-side
[01:57] SubStack: although I don't think there is an arbitrary precision floating point module on npm yet
[01:57] Emmanuel` has joined the channel
[01:57] SubStack: it can convert /some/ node programs to run client-side
[01:57] int_64: isaccs, oh! interesting
[01:57] bluesmoon: at least in node.js you don't have php generating javascript that generates html using input parameters.  fewer language boundaries == fewer chances of screwing up
[01:58] SubStack: it tries
[01:58] int_64: I can see some value in that
[01:58] int_64: for sopme thing
[01:58] isaacs: int_64: and you can use socket.io to send messages back and forth, or dnode over socket.io to call functions.
[01:58] jerrysv: also, there's dnode -- rpc
[01:58] int_64: that dont use databases I guess
[01:58] int_64: ah ok
[01:58] tjholowaychuk: int_64 i though that too it comes in quite handy even for utils n shit that you dont end up writing twice
[01:58] jerrysv: and you can always expose the REPL
[01:58] isaacs: int_64, SubStack: yeah, not ALL node programs, but a lot of stuff.
[01:58] int_64: right
[01:58] tjholowaychuk: when i first started with node i didn't think i would reuse much
[01:58] jerrysv: .. 1 + 1;
[01:58] catb0t: 2
[01:59] tmzt: SubStack: have you seen this? https://github.com/tristandunn/webkit-server
[01:59] int_64: isaccs, ok
[01:59] steffan_ has joined the channel
[02:00] tmzt: int_64: you can use databases if you want
[02:00] tmzt: most of the libraries are asynchronous, so you wait for the results then it calls acallback
[02:00] pandeiro has joined the channel
[02:01] int_64: tmzt, oh sure, I just meant about what was mentioned of converting server side JS to client side
[02:01] int_64: hmm maybe you also mean that
[02:01] tjholowaychuk: int_64 and you can have APIs like this that are nearly identical for the client/server https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent
[02:01] int_64: That is pretty interesting to be able to atuomatically convert your server side app to the client
[02:01] SubStack: tmzt: not sure what that is for
[02:01] tmzt: you can, for validation for instance
[02:01] tmzt: http://rzrsharp.net/2011/08/16/introducing-vows-bdd.html
[02:01] tmzt: SubStack: they are using it to run tests on client-side html in node.js
[02:02] tmzt: I don't know if it renders pages or not
[02:02] CStumph has joined the channel
[02:02] jerrysv: we test client-side in vows via node
[02:02] jerrysv: need a couple of mocks, but it works fairly well
[02:02] techwraith has left the channel
[02:03] jerrysv: er, client side js
[02:03] SubStack: tmzt: I have something much more capable in the works

[02:26] eee_c: Gonna have to add compatibility layer to send in string or boolean argument depending on the node version :-\
[02:27] mscdex: eee_c: yeah, it's unfortunate that there was a release before the last change was made
[02:28] mscdex: eee_c: but the method names changed, so the booleans shouldn't be confused now
[02:29] eee_c: True, but Buffer.writeUInt32 still exists but with a different signature now.

[04:50] ChrisPartridge: StanlySoManly: node_modules ?

[04:58] Nexxy: the file in local/ should be requiring ../jsdom if it resides in ../

[05:02] Nexxy: put it in node_modules
[05:02] matyr has joined the channel
[05:02] Nexxy: jsdom that is
[05:03] StanlySoManly: Nexxy: it is, I think...   ~/local/node_modules has jsdom -> ../lib/node_modules/jsdom

[05:25] domo1: right?
[05:25] AAA_awright: domo1: I use typeof() too but just know that it isn't a function, typeof is a keyword and it's evaluating the type of "(functions['my_function'])"

[06:24] Nuck: Draggor: Ah.
[06:25] Draggor: though its throttle could probably be better handled
[06:25] Draggor: freenode allows a burst of 5 messages in a second, then 2/second until you open up the window or osme such

[07:00] AAA_awright: davidbanham: When I said "maybe there's a special case" maybe it knows to run the for-loop internally, because generally for(var i=0; i<a.length; a++) is far faster than for(var i in a) for Arrays, and since a String is a special case of an Array, I guess strings too
[07:00] zilch has joined the channel

[07:01] JakeyChan: hi, I have a beginner question. what does do with require function ??
[07:02] JakeyChan: what does do of require function 
[07:02] JakeyChan: not with 
[07:02] DrMcKay: JakeyChan: it loads libraries
[07:02] DrMcKay: in node we call them modules
[07:02] JakeyChan: not the complete answer
[07:02] DrMcKay: they have useful things, like functions and classes
[07:02] JakeyChan: require function is supported by v8 ?
[07:02] al3xnull has joined the channel
[07:03] JakeyChan: or just javascript function ?
[07:03] AAA_awright: It's provided by Node.js
[07:03] DrMcKay: it's something node implements
[07:03] AAA_awright: It's not a part of ECMAScript
[07:03] JakeyChan: ok.
[07:03] davidbanham: AAA_awright: I had no idea there was a difference in speed between the two. I thought it was just different syntax for the same function. Good to know, cheers.
[07:04] JakeyChan: this is why I can not find it in the node js library
[07:04] AAA_awright: davidbanham: Appearently the "for in" syntax has to generate an Array of keys for what it's iterating over, so you're adding an additional Object.keys() call (or something like that)
[07:04] JakeyChan: can i debug the code when require module ?
[07:04] AAA_awright: effectively, not literally
[07:04] cryptic has joined the channel
[07:05] DrMcKay: JakeyChan: it's not written in JS
[07:05] AAA_awright: DrMcKay: Actually it is
[07:05] DrMcKay: AAA_awright: oh, sorry. where?
[07:05] AAA_awright: DrMcKay: lib/module.js
[07:05] butu5: JackeyChan: writing own module is very simple.. u need to use export keyword to publish the function
[07:05] AAA_awright: in the Node source code
[07:06] JakeyChan: DrMcKay: where can I found this code that finish require work ?
[07:06] butu5: JackeyChan: and can put any debug message there like console.log or u can use any debugger

[07:08] AAA_awright: DrMcKay: If you open a file in a debugger, you see it's wrapped with "(function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) { " and "\n});", module.js does that to provide those variables
[07:08] trotter has joined the channel
[07:08] AAA_awright: And an aside, if you want to stop execution of a module you use return; and not process.exit();
[07:09] al3xnull has joined the channel
[07:09] AAA_awright: Otherwise console.log output won't get to the terminal because it's an async function, and process.exit() kills all outstanding writes

[08:49] JakeyChan: AAA_awright: what do you use ?
[08:49] JakeyChan: to install package ?
[08:49] AAA_awright: git clone
[08:49] JakeyChan: and put the folder into ~/node_modules?
[08:49] rhaen: AAA_awright: just cloning them in the right place?
[08:50] AAA_awright: JakeyChan: You clone it into a node_modules directory under where your node.js app is
[08:50] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[08:50] AAA_awright: JakeyChan: Read the Node.js documentation
[08:50] AAA_awright: It explains how it searches for modules
[08:50] AAA_awright: rhaen: Yeah
[08:51] JakeyChan: but I want the modules can be used by another app that I created :)
[08:51] JakeyChan: share module :)
[08:51] rhaen: AAA_awright: that's alot easier to track their progress, true :) 
[08:51] JakeyChan: :D
[08:52] AAA_awright: Somehow npm positioned itself as able to do something new and unique, did it in a horrible way (global install path), even though Node.js could do local modules all along without any need for a package manager
[08:52] mscdex: just so you know, you can do: npm install <url/fs path to tarball>
[08:52] AvianFlu: DrMcKay: +10 for just giving a docs link and not spitting out mad text!
[08:52] AAA_awright: And the only package manager I've ever liked is portage, npm is no exception to my wrath of hatred of package managers and build systems
[08:52] DrMcKay: AvianFlu: thanks :)
[08:52] brainproxy: AAA_awright: tried Dist::Zilla?
[08:53] Nuck: Goddamnit, node_mailer
[08:53] mscdex: what the nuck
[08:53] AAA_awright: brainproxy: Never heard of it
[08:53] AAA_awright: http://bzfx.net/guru/ is my improved build system+package manager
[08:53] rhaen: AAA_awright: I agree partially with you :) But the registry of modules is a nice thing in NPM!
[08:53] brainproxy: AAA_awright: pluggable build system, built in perl/Moose
[08:53] AvianFlu: lol nice mscdex, new catchphrase
[08:54] AAA_awright: rhaen: You don't need it, we have URIs to use for idenyifying packages, and just use package.json to map module names => Git repository/etc
[08:54] AAA_awright: Global namespaces are evil, I've learned, RDF has it right, use URIs to identify resources
[08:54] mscdex: you can also do: npm install <directory>
[08:54] AvianFlu: Nuck: what's up with node mailer
[08:55] rhaen: AAA_awright: ah, right. I just makes it very easy to check for available modules (for me as newbie)
[08:55] DrMcKay: fun fact: config/environment.js has 256 characters
[08:56] AAA_awright: rhaen: Oh I see, as a directory of things, though the Node.js wiki already has something for that

[08:57] Glenjamin: your complaint about npm is that it globally installs?
[08:57] rhaen: mscdex: hm, you are hungry? Just get something to eat :)
[08:58] mscdex: npm install food
[08:58] Nuck: mscdex: It's 2 AM and I ate asstons about an hour ago.
[08:58] mscdex: is that an SI unit?
[08:58] Nuck: isaac should make NPM edible.
[08:58] rhaen: mscdex, try -g if it doesn't work :)
[08:58] Nuck: mscdex: No, that's asskilograms
[08:58] Nuck: ASSGRAMS
[08:58] Nuck: It's like a candygram but... with an ass.

[09:03] AvianFlu: Go do the PHP thing on your own time!
[09:03] DrMcKay: it doesn't
[09:04] Nuck: I like how NPM manages packages.
[09:04] AAA_awright: I thought it did, it has some bizarre naming scheme
[09:04] AvianFlu: I mean, npm isn't actually official, guys
[09:04] Nuck: The handling of dependencies is amazing.
[09:04] AvianFlu: it's just the super popular open source solution
[09:04] Nuck: IMO, it SHOULD be official.
[09:04] AvianFlu: I mean, you know, "official"
[09:04] Nuck: It might as well be at this point :P
[09:04] AvianFlu: it is anyway

[09:05] uchuff: long shot but anyone here know AWS EC2 at all?
[09:05] AvianFlu: a bit
[09:05] DrMcKay: No, seriously, npm is cool, bu there should be a choice
[09:05] AvianFlu: what's the question
[09:05] AvianFlu: ?
[09:05] Nuck: DrMcKay: There is a choice
[09:05] AvianFlu: I find it's always better to ask than to ask if you can ask before you ask
[09:05] AAA_awright: DrMcKay: It's even harder to install a python package because that has to be global, that's like, python is stuck in the state that npm thought Node.js was in (when you had to install stuff globally, before npm became usable by more than 3 people)
[09:05] uchuff: true AvianFlu
[09:05] uchuff: wondering how I know if my EC2 instance is set up to use persistant storage if I stop it (to increase it in size)
[09:06] Nuck: You can use it, or use one of the unmaintained alternatives, or do it yourself.
[09:06] uchuff: "Root Device Type" says "EBS"
[09:06] DrMcKay: AAA_awright: you don't really have to install it globally, you can just set PYTHONPATH
[09:06] Nuck: But trust me, you never want to do that last thing.
[09:06] uchuff: so I think that means it is
[09:06] Nuck: uchuff: EBS is Elastic Block Store
[09:06] DrMcKay: but, I like the idea of local npm_modules thing, really
[09:06] DrMcKay: *node_modules
[09:06] kulor-uk has joined the channel
[09:06] Nuck: DrMcKay: THAT is part of Node.
[09:07] brainproxy: having everything localized definitely promotes portability
[09:07] AAA_awright: DrMcKay: That became a better idea than I thought it was going to be
[09:07] Nuck: You can install to there manually and it'll be recognized by Node.
[09:07] AvianFlu: yeah, node_modules is a part of the require() stuff
[09:07] AvianFlu: as opposed to npm
[09:07] AAA_awright: Error: require.paths is removed. Use node_modules folders, or the NODE_PATH environment variable instead.
[09:07] AAA_awright: This, not so much
[09:07] DrMcKay: Nuck: exactly, that's what I like in it
[09:07] uchuff: any idea AvianFlu

[09:07] AvianFlu: not offhand, but you should do some googling - there have been quite a few blog posts about using EC2
[09:08] brainproxy: prior to running your script
[09:08] DrMcKay: Python needs PYTHONPATH mangling, and node just does it
[09:08] AAA_awright: brainproxy: Which is why that makes no sense at all
[09:08] FireFly|n900 has joined the channel
[09:08] Nuck: DrMcKay: Well, welcome to the post-NPM world.  God, I remember when NPM was just starting to become the standard.
[09:08] Nuck: That was when I was still mucking around blindly with Node 0.2.6
[09:08] uchuff: ya AvianFlu. A lot are outdated and it's not clear which are, then others it tells you what to do but it's not apparent what to check
[09:09] uchuff: I think I may just reboot it and see what happens
[09:09] brainproxy: AAA_awright: well I think it's an escape valve if you just have to be able to get at certain modules
[09:09] uchuff: cross my fingers
[09:09] iivvoo: you don't have to install python packages globally. use virtualenv

[09:14] framlin: AAA_awright: is it possible to change NODE_PATH at runtiime from within my app?
[09:15] AAA_awright: framlin: Things internal to your package should use the "./module" syntax, everything else should be in node_modules and use plain "module" syntax

[09:15] Nuck: AAA_awright: I'm stuck on Windows until I gather $1500 :P
[09:15] framlin: Nuck: maybe, but for me (until now) node_modules is external and other dirs are "internal"

[09:16] framlin: AAA_awright: ./module - syntax??
[09:16] DrMcKay: Nuck: run Linux on VirtualBox or something
[09:16] Nuck: framlin: Then make it internal
[09:16] AAA_awright: framlin: ./module loads a module.(js|node|...) from the same directory
[09:17] Nuck: DrMcKay: No need, I have a home server with Ubuntu 11.04
[09:17] mscdex: DrMcKay: or run Windows on Virtualbox >:-D
[09:17] Nuck: I just prefer being able to edit in my favorite editor and save and alt tab
[09:17] DrMcKay: Nuck: then, OK :).
[09:17] framlin: AAA_awright: but I have more than on dir that hold "internal"-modules
[09:17] AAA_awright: framlin: If you're splitting up an app into multiple files like you should, you use ./module with the leading ./ to indicate you load it from the same directory
[09:18] Raynos has joined the channel
[09:18] DrMcKay: that reminded me of updating my Windows :/. everytime I boot it to play for a while it install > 30 updates
[09:18] AAA_awright: else, without the ./, it goes through the search path where your 3rd party modules are
[09:18] framlin: and I decide at runtime, what from where I load modules, by setting require.paths

[09:20] framlin: ok, I have to try this, but for the moment, I think this will loose a lot of flexability
[09:20] Nuck: I ain't switching to Linux
[09:20] framlin: is ther a reason for that limitiation?
[09:20] Nuck: That fucking piece of shit >:C
[09:20] brainproxy: framlin: yes, the node.js / JS community as a whole is moving away from globalizing dependencies
[09:20] framlin: brainproxy: yes, but why should I buld wrapper, if it has worked so well? ;)

[09:21] Nuck: I like Sexy UIs
[09:21] DrMcKay: Nuck: GNOME3?

[09:21] Nuck: With the console as another feature
[09:21] Nuck: DrMcKay: Too much work to set it up
[09:21] AAA_awright: It doesn't make much of a difference
[09:22] DrMcKay: Nuck: nope, download Fedora 15 and install :)
[09:22] framlin: but I can not recognize, why this will "move away from globalizing dependencies" ..
[09:22] AAA_awright: Nuck: For all the crap it gets, Ubuntu 14 is pretty slick
[09:22] Nuck: AAA_awright: Ubuntu 14?
[09:22] brainproxy: framlin: because hard-wiring your app to a non-relative path is a kind of global dep
[09:22] AAA_awright: The latest one they have
[09:22] Nuck: AAA_awright: AFAIK, Ubuntu's only at 11
[09:22] brainproxy: and isn't immediately portable
[09:22] AAA_awright: What's it called
[09:22] DrMcKay: Ubuntu 11.04, I think
[09:22] Nuck: Which came out like a year ago
[09:22] brainproxy: iow, you would need to recreate the same path and what it contains, if you move the app to another server
[09:23] AAA_awright: Well that's the date it came out
[09:23] Nuck: Ubuntu 11.04 is pretty nice.
[09:23] AAA_awright: 2011-04
[09:23] AAA_awright: It's not a version
[09:23] Nuck: AAA_awright: wat
[09:23] AvianFlu has joined the channel
[09:23] iivvoo: ubuntu 11.04 is ok if you install gnome 2.x :)
[09:23] DrMcKay: AAA_awright: you're counting releases?
[09:23] framlin: brainproxy: I the non-relative-module is coded by myself, it isame dependancy if it is below the same dir as my "main-dir" or if it is beside or it
[09:23] Nuck: 11.04 is the best UI yet IMO
[09:23] Nuck: Still sucks though
[09:24] Nuck: Not like Windows 7 or Mac OS X
[09:24] AAA_awright: Nuck: What I do hate about Ubuntu is it's on a release cycle, They'll gladly hold new features back for up to 6 months and then release them all at once so they can WOW you with all the new features that ONLY THEY can bless onto you
[09:24] AAA_awright: Every 6 months they release a new one
[09:24] Nuck: AAA_awright: Yeah
[09:24] Nuck: Almost time for 11.11
[09:24] AAA_awright: >:(
[09:24] brainproxy: framlin: well if it's relative, then you you can just prepend it in your require statments, or create a wrapper like `myRequire()`
[09:24] brainproxy: which does that for you
[09:25] AAA_awright: That's why I'm a proud Gentoo user, on my desktops and my servers

[09:25] Nuck: Our server runs Debian (simply because we're all Linux noobs lol)
[09:25] Nuck: Well, our SA isn't a noob
[09:25] Nuck: He's just lazy
[09:26] framlin: brainproxy: I dont think that it is a good idea and i do not think that it will reduce any dependency ....
[09:26] DrMcKay: Nuck: like any SA ;)
[09:26] Nuck: Both of us developers are Windows users
[09:26] Nuck: Developing on Cygwin and testing on a Debian VPS with 8 cores
[09:26] Nuck: Just set up Cluster today :D
[09:26] framlin: maybe one need this for windows ...?
[09:26] brainproxy: framlin: but what it will do is make it clear where your modules not conforming to node_modules pattern are stored
[09:26] Nuck: Then I ran apache bench on it :P
[09:26] DrMcKay: Nuck: do a bitcoit mining :D
[09:27] Nuck: DrMcKay: I should suggest that to our SA as a way to harness some unused CPU :P
[09:27] framlin: but I have normal modules, normal commonJS module, that confirm (as I think) to node. But I do not want to have them in a certain directory with a certain name, where I have to put all modules in
[09:28] framlin: that makes no sense to me
[09:28] DrMcKay: AAA_awright: have you tried comparing performance to other distribution which use binaries for package managment?
[09:28] AAA_awright: framlin: It's no different than putting it in ~/node_modules or /var/lib/whatever
[09:28] AAA_awright: DrMcKay: We have it down to a science, and Gentoo kicks ass in that department
[09:29] Nuck: But anyways, I spun up 4 of my API servers
[09:29] framlin: the benefit of nodejs is (so far) its flexability (dynamic). If I have to have a certain dir-structure with restricted names, its like Java-Servlets :(
[09:29] DrMcKay: AAA_awright: that's where -mtune=native makes *real* sense, I suppose :)
[09:30] framlin: AAA_awright: but I want to have the freedom to organize my code as I think it is good for my project
[09:30] AAA_awright: When it's compiled for *your* processor, they aren't kidding, if you swap the processor don't be suprised when you get a kernel panic
[09:30] framlin: I do not want that other people tell me, how I have to organize *my* code
[09:30] DrMcKay: AAA_awright: hint: try clang or icc for compiling computation-heavy apps
[09:31] AAA_awright: DrMcKay: We use icc for compiling nginx and other packages
[09:31] Nuck: Hitting about 70% CPU usage on each server with apache bench at 1000/50,000
[09:31] AAA_awright: mysql, uh
[09:31] Nuck: Don't even hit 5% RAM tho
[09:31] framlin: its ok, if code from "outside" that other people have coded has to be stored at a certain place, but IMHO its not ok for my "internal" modules
[09:31] DrMcKay: AAA_awright: mysql, seriously?
[09:31] AAA_awright: There's a list of about 40 that we use icc for, it gets us an additional 10% over gcc (!)
[09:32] DrMcKay: AAA_awright: I know, I did some benchmarks
[09:32] DrMcKay: AAA_awright: Python gets massive speed-up
[09:32] AAA_awright: Our kernel is 4.5M compressed in /boot

[09:33] DrMcKay: AAA_awright: wow...
[09:33] framlin: is there any documentation about this changed behaviour?
[09:34] DrMcKay: AAA_awright: also, there were some guys trying to compile kernel using ICC
[09:34] brainproxy: framlin: the recursive node_modules pattern is something the designers of node.js (and npm) have settled on to solve some tricky problems, and in a particular way
[09:34] brainproxy: it's here to stay, but again, as needed you can create wrappers to give different behavior
[09:34] framlin: brainproxy: what has the recursive node_modules pattern to do with require.paths?
[09:35] AAA_awright: DrMcKay: Problem is, how do you benchmark that? Can you? And can you guarentee it won't interfere with loadable modules and binary blobs?
[09:35] brainproxy: framlin: it is being promoted over and against require.paths
[09:35] AAA_awright: I know we've looked into that patch or whatever it is (that wasn't me)

[09:36] AAA_awright: framlin: You don't have to use node_modules, but you *are* expected to use the ./ syntax for loading local modules
[09:36] brainproxy: see especially the subsection in the latter titled ""
[09:36] AAA_awright: That's just for good portability

[09:39] DrMcKay: any ideas for features for that bot?
[09:39] framlin: AAA_awright: is something like require('../../other_app/lib/tools') allowed?

[09:41] AAA_awright: framlin: If you know, no matter what system it's on, that a module is going to have the same relative path, then you use "./path/to/module". Otherwise you should place the module in your NODE_PATH or in node_modules and use the global syntax "module"
[09:41] AAA_awright: framlin: It doesn't look like ./../../other_app/lib/tools is going to remain the same, it might be better to have a symlink inside node_modules

[09:46] Nuck: lol apache benche vs. one instance = 100% CPU plus lotsa lag
[09:46] AAA_awright: framlin: Pretty much, if you're referring to another module in the same git repository, you use "./" else you look for it in the standard search path
[09:46] Nuck: apache bench vs. 6 instances = wavering between 20% and 80% CPU for each core, but much faster response times
[09:47] AAA_awright: Nuck: That sounds right
[09:47] Nuck: Pity it won't let me go above 1000 concurrent connections

[09:47] Nuck: Something about maxing out on open files :D
[09:47] AAA_awright: Lolol
[09:47] brainproxy: Nuck: you can fix that if you change the ulimit
[09:47] Nuck: Node can take a load better than apache bench can serve?
[09:47] Nuck: brainproxy: How do?
[09:48] brainproxy: Nuck: depends on the system
[09:48] AAA_awright: ab uses more CPU than Node.js
[09:48] AAA_awright: You're really not supposed to use ab from the same system for anything serious
[09:48] Nuck: I have 8 cores
[09:48] Nuck: And 6 of them are on Node

[11:07] DrMcKay: http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/2011/03/running-nodejs-on-a-rooted-android-phone.php
[11:07] der_lunz: I also tried a native build on ubuntu chroot, which worked, but the binary segfaulted, because of mismatching glibc stuff
[11:07] DrMcKay: more details here: http://d.hatena.ne.jp/forest1040/20110318/1300460817
[11:08] DrMcKay: you may want to follow the procedure there, it seems to be good for cross compiling node
[11:08] micheil has joined the channel
[11:09] der_lunz: thanks, I've tried the chroot road. It failed because the chroot uses some later gcc, and I wasn't able to build a static binary

[11:14] der_lunz: So: Installed arm eabi-chroot using ubuntu maverick. compiled node 0.4.10. the compilation worked. On the openwrt target i got:
[11:14] der_lunz: ./node: /lib/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.9' not found (required by ./node)
[11:14] der_lunz: ./node: /lib/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.7' not found (required by ./node)
[11:14] DrMcKay: Nuck: are you sure you've compiled your timezone with correct internationalization settings :D ?
[11:14] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[11:15] DrMcKay: der_lunz: what version of glibc does openwrt have?
[11:15] der_lunz: copied over glibc from maveric chroot, and ran with LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path-to-maveric-libc> node. which resulted in a segfault
[11:15] Nuck: DrMcKay: You gonna try and shove it on a router now?
[11:16] Nuck: Fuck, that'd be madness
[11:16] der_lunz: openwrt 10.03 uses glibc 2.6.1. 
[11:16] DrMcKay: der_lunz: no way to upgrade it?
[11:16] DrMcKay: der_lunz: you may try to compile compatible glibc from source
[11:17] der_lunz: No it isn't a router, but a imx51 hardware, comparable to some iphone.

[11:17] industrial: I'm not getting ANY console log
[11:17] industrial: and I dont know why :(
[11:18] Nuck: Somebody should port Node to iPhone :P
[11:18] Nuck: Make it a REPL
[11:18] der_lunz: openwrt, does the whole build system. gcc, glibc, and all that stuff. I attached a node.js Makefile, which would compile node in it's own cross build environment, but that resulted, in the v8 sources beeing deleted in the compilation process
[11:18] orbx has joined the channel
[11:18] DrMcKay: industrial: shouldn't async.series be called with array instead of dict?
[11:19] industrial: DrMcKay: according to the docs either is possible, and dicts are used to make it more readable, but I'll try with an array too.
[11:19] DrMcKay: industrial: (you're probably right, I'm just looking at the README)
[11:19] industrial: DrMcKay: I still get nothing if it's an array
[11:20] DrMcKay: der_lunz: try to compile compatible glibc in openwrt chroot, install it and try compiling node again
[11:20] der_lunz: that's worth a try.

[13:39] Glenjamin: depywork: do you already know JS or event-loop style programming?
[13:39] depywork: I know JS pretty well I think
[13:40] depywork: I do quite a lot of browser JS  so async callbacks don't scare me :)
[13:40] tuhoojabotti: depywork: You know closures?!
[13:40] depywork: yes
[13:40] Glenjamin: is there any documentation/tutorials for the node idioms that have emerged?
[13:41] Glenjamin: like single callback as last argument, error as first argument of callback
[13:41] Glenjamin: what to call your local var for which closes this
[13:43] framlin: depywork: the book hands on nodejs tells you a lot about the "standard-libs" of nodejs
[13:43] Glenjamin: because if you already know JS i'd say all you need is the API docs, the list of modules, and an overview of "standard" node idioms
[13:44] garrensmith: depywork: I would start with using expressjs and go from there
[13:44] framlin: but if you know JavaScript well, I think commonJS - modules makes the most diffrence to "normal browser-apps"
[13:45] bradleymeck has joined the channel
[13:45] Glenjamin: but if you've ever done python, using modules should come naturally enough
[13:47] depywork: Never did python actually. But I looked at node and how modules work with export and stuff. It looks pretty straight forward...
[13:47] Glenjamin: it just separates things nicely, and hides "private" functions rather effectively. Somewhat too effectively in some cases
[13:48] depywork: Well I did module in JS so that shouldn't be a problem... :)
[13:48] depywork: So I think I'm ready to give NodeJS a try...

[13:56] misterm: TwoGroomsInNYC: it depends on what you mean by "contains"
[13:56] misterm: TwoGroomsInNYC: you would us hasOwnProperty if you care if the property *exists* rather than it's value, and want it to be an own property rather than a prototype property
[13:57] TwoGroomsInNYC: misterm: Has an object attached to it
[13:57] TwoGroomsInNYC: I want to make sure it exists before running some code.
[13:57] misterm: TwoGroomsInNYC: if you just care if it has a particular value, just use object.property amd check the value
[13:57] TwoGroomsInNYC: I just care that it exists, as it is requisite to the code working.
[13:58] Glenjamin: presumably you only *actually* care that the object has the methods you indend to call
[13:58] misterm: if you just care that a property exists, not what it holds, and you don't care about it being a prototype property or not...then you can use prop in ob
[13:58] vikstrous has joined the channel

[14:03] Glenjamin: no, its more general
[14:03] misterm: TwoGroomsInNYC: no, that's what i was saying
[14:03] Glenjamin: it will look on the object, and up the prototype chain

[14:06] brianc: Raynos: I found vows to be a bit cumbersome, but I haven't looked at it in over 6 months
[14:06] Glenjamin: I'm currently working on something that's similar-ish to Ruby's RSpec - but it's not really ready yet
[14:06] Raynos: vows is a bit cumbersome
[14:06] Raynos: I found espresso a pain
[14:06] Glenjamin: it depends how you want to use it i suppose
[14:06] brianc: Raynos: nodeunit works alright, but it over-rides the 'assert' module and you can't really write your own custom assertions easily
[14:06] brianc: I've found really the best is to just have a bunch of test files
[14:07] brianc: each one being a fully executable "unit" (or functional) test of whatever
[14:07] Glenjamin: feel free to have a go with http://github.com/glenjamin/nodespec

[14:43] gw280: hey I have a question for the buildsystem experts
[14:43] gw280: basically our compiler relies on a set of environment variables being defined or it won't run
[14:44] gw280: and we're using the CMake node.js buildsystem, which invokes SCons on the v8 buildsystem
[14:44] bradleymeck: snk1 you wouldnt, you would make a function before hand
[14:44] gw280: unfortunately SCons doesn't propagate the parent's environment to the invoked CXX/CC
[14:44] gw280: so our compiler bombs with an error saying we need to define those variables

[14:59] malletjo: TwoGroomsInNYC, indeed
[15:00] MadonnasNo1Fan: malletjo: You need to do two queries sequentially?
[15:01] malletjo: MadonnasNo1Fan,  i could use a callback ... but i'm not sure its the best way in my situation

[15:03] malletjo: its' recursif , so i got lot of select in this table before the result come out. ( exist or not ) , and i got lots of duplicate
[15:03] MadonnasNo1Fan: malletjo: A sync operation seems dangerous in node.js because while you're waiting on MySQL, you can't process incoming HTTP requests.
[15:04] malletjo: i'll try to figure out another way
[15:04] MadonnasNo1Fan: I am not a node.js expert, though. Can anyone verify that sync operations lock up node.js?
[15:04] malletjo: it's not a http server anyway ; im using nodejs for cron/parser stuff

[15:07] MadonnasNo1Fan: Twisted has defer to thread
[15:08] malletjo: Glenjamin, the next solution is to do modify table keys and insert .. on duplicate ignore. problem solved.

[15:23] xerox: it's pretty new
[15:23] malletjo: Glenjamin, not really. One select => if not exist insert. The problem is i have this like X run in parr. So i all the select have been done Before the first insert , so i have duplicate. On solution is to know run many in parr. and use a callback 
[15:24] garrensmith: softdrink: EventSource?
[15:24] softdrink: http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/
[15:24] garrensmith: cool thanks
[15:24] Glenjamin: malletjo: well enforcing no duplicates using a unique index makes the most sense, and then apply whatever application logic is necessary to handle the errors you'll get back
[15:25] vikstrous_ has joined the channel
[15:25] malletjo: Glenjamin, yep i add unique index + insert ignore for now , but this is tricky because it change the ids ( replace the old / new )
[15:26] Glenjamin: instead of insert ignore, just check the error code in the mysql callback and handle it node-side
[15:26] sebasti__ has joined the channel
[15:26] malletjo: Right now , i think ill try to "prepare" the table BEFORE processing so i dont have any insert to do , only select. I think it will fix this problem, but maybe not all.

[17:58] kepheus: hi. I'm currently trying to learn node.js and am using node-scraper to play around a bit. I have (so two say) to nested calls to scraper, but the second one gets called only one and after the first iterations. what am I doing wrong here? thanks! example: http://dpaste.com/597499/

[17:58] gf3: tjholowaychuk: useful in many other situations: 24px * 2 → 48px
[17:59] tjholowaychuk: gf3 that should work fine
[17:59] tjholowaychuk: > 24px * 2

[18:52] pizthewiz: is there a good way via connect/express that i could use a prefix to map to a specific set of static assets? like /generated_images/ maps to a specific static location. or perhaps i should just write my own static handler?
[18:53] hunterloftis: pizthewiz are you just looking for a public folder?
[18:53] CoverSlide: yuo can have multiple staic handlers
[18:53] pizthewiz: in addition to public, i have a second set of generated assets that sit elsewhere on the filesystem, i almost wanted something like this: app.get(/\/generated_image\/(.*)/, express.static(eventConfig.projectPath));
[18:53] hunterloftis: pizthewiz: server.use(express.static(server.set('public'))); should do it if I understand your question
[18:53] tjholowaychuk: pizthewiz app.use(express.static('public'))
[18:54] random123 has joined the channel
[18:54] tjholowaychuk: pizthewiz app.use('/public', express.static('public')) if you want to "mount" it at "/public"
[18:54] garrensmith has joined the channel
[18:54] pizthewiz: oh, so i could mount my second static point with a prefix that way, perfect -- thanks!

[18:55] malletjo: DrMcKay, weird , if i remove "sha1sum.update(fileContent).digest('hex')" , the console.log is working and not crash ( seg fault ) , if i put back the sha1sum it crash.
[18:55] DrMcKay: malletjo: oh, interesting
[18:55] versicolor has joined the channel
[18:55] guybrush: pizthewiz: connect.static is just fine - if your want to do something really special there is res.sendfile :D but it has no cache, range and other stuff i think
[18:56] DrMcKay: malletjo: just a little snippet of code, please?
[18:56] pizthewiz: tjholowaychuk: perfect thank you, that is a lot cleaner than poking around with my own arbitrary / bad static handler
[18:56] guybrush: *if you
[18:56] tjholowaychuk: guybrush it uses the same code actually
[18:56] tjholowaychuk: connect.static.send

[18:57] slifty has joined the channel
[18:57] pizthewiz: guybrush: yeah i was thinking i'd have to do something similar as my assets are currently absolute filepaths, but i'll just transform them then set a specific mount point, so i can easily tell which is coming form where
[18:57] malletjo: i'll provide a use case and post it here and maybe file a bug
[18:57] DrMcKay: OK. but generally you should report it with a test case or something
[18:57] malletjo: exactly
[18:57] DrMcKay: malletjo: that'll be greatly appreciated :)

[18:58] pizthewiz: tjholowaychuk: that did the trick thanks again

[20:55] bradleymeck has joined the channel
[20:55] msync: actually, the latest version of NodeJS has windows build "node.exe" so I guess we dont need Cygwin anymore
[20:55] msync: no.. It's example.js.

[20:56] hdon-: msync, i mean is stdout being redirected to a file and not your terminal emulator?

[21:48] sechrist: it even lets you proxy websockets

[21:49] AvianFlu: that proxy looks like it's trying to http connect to an ssh port though
[21:50] AvianFlu: the one you pasted
[21:50] AvianFlu: that doesn't really make sense to me
[21:50] sechrist: if I can pipe your shit to grep, i'll rep
[21:50] Guest35: yeah actually i was trying to implement ssh over http
[21:50] Aikar: ok so I see a connect event fire on client and on server
[21:50] AvianFlu: ssh involves a complex key-exchange mechanism
[21:50] sechrist: Isn't there already a standard for ssh over webtunneling?

[22:34] kepheus: chjj: i see
[22:35] chjj: Raynos: markdown-js is rather slow for some reason, i know my parser can also do things i havent seen either showdown or markdown-js do, like render code blocks in list items
[22:35] admc has joined the channel
[22:35] Raynos: does marked output a tree?
[22:35] Raynos: can I manipulate it through some API
[22:35] kepheus: chjj: node-scraper uses jsdom, and I think that dom generation is blocking. does this sound legit?
[22:35] chjj: kepheus: ill check it out
[22:36] JoshC1 has joined the channel
[22:36] chjj: raynos: it doesnt output a tree for performance reasons, it tokenizes and then parses and compiles directly from the tokens
[22:36] chjj: Raynos: i do expose access to the lexer though, you can have access to the raw tokens
[22:37] chjj: Raynos: before theyre parsed: `var tokens = marked.lexer(str);`
[22:37] Raynos: I got that far ;)
[22:37] chjj: none of the inline stuff has tokens there though, just the block level stuff, also for performance reasons
[22:37] chjj: if you benchmark markdown-js, youll see why i went that route
[22:38] Raynos: Yeah I can see why but I need to manipulate this text somehow
[22:38] chjj: what do you need to do?
[22:38] Raynos: I want to only render the first two paragraphs sometimes
[22:38] Raynos: http://raynos.org/blog the home page renders the first two <p> tags
[22:39] chjj: hmm, okay, you could still do that
[22:39] nerdfiles1 has joined the channel
[22:39] nerdfiles1 has left the channel
[22:39] chjj: when it parses the markdown, you wont find any paragraph tokens, because paragraphs are so implicit in markdown, instead youll find a bunch of "text" tokens
[22:40] Raynos: the lexer contains an array
[22:40] Raynos: can I just take the first two tokens and only render that
[22:40] Raynos: Ugh I have to not remove the links
[22:40] chjj: so basically, iterate over the tokens, until you either find something thats not a `text` token, or until you find two `text` tokens that are two lines apart
[22:40] Raynos: are the links always last?
[22:40] chjj: (check token.line)
[22:41] chjj: all the inline stuff is done from inside the parser unfortunately

[22:45] tjholowaychuk: Darrow: brave: port 80, fast: nginx etc, going all-node: node-http-proxy
[22:45] Raynos: Works for sample case of 2
[22:45] Darrow: AvianFlu, tjholowaychuk: thanks, I'll check out http-proxy
[22:45] AvianFlu: Darrow: as a note, though, it takes some hoop-jumping to get nginx to proxy websockets
[22:46] AvianFlu: possible, and not that hard if you're not afraid to compile stuff yourself
[22:46] devaholic has joined the channel

[22:46] AvianFlu: no websockets, though, no problem
[22:46] AvianFlu: nginx is pretty boss
[22:46] Darrow: Yeah, I remember hearing about that a while back.
[22:46] chjj: Raynos: it would look something like that
[22:46] pixel13 has joined the channel
[22:47] Darrow: Does http-proxy do https too?
[22:47] chjj: Raynos: you should also probably check whether token.type === 'text' or not
[22:47] AvianFlu: yep
[22:47] Darrow: Awesome, sounds perfect.
[22:47] AvianFlu: there are code examples for it if you scroll way the hell down the readme
[22:47] AvianFlu: http -> https, https - > http, https -> https
[22:47] Raynos: chjj: I dont think that will work
[22:48] chjj: Raynos: you might have to mess around with it a bit
[22:48] pixel13 has left the channel
[22:48] Raynos: I have i got it to work by just grabbing the first two array members
[22:48] chjj: Raynos: try looking at the output tokens
[22:49] chjj: Raynos: yeah thats possible if you dont have any line feeds in the paragraphs themselves
[22:49] Raynos: Ah I see. I dont have any of those
[22:49] chjj: Raynos: but it will break otherwise, the problem is, theres no `paragraph` token, theres only individual lines
[22:49] chjj: for other block level things, there are tokens, for lists, code blocks, etc
[22:50] chjj: but not paragraphs, because theyre so implicit, and have different semantics in different places
[22:50] chjj: so each `text` token, represents a line of text that doesnt mean a whole lot
[22:50] Raynos: AHa

[23:06] DrMcKay: nickaugust: ok, will fix that
[23:07] Raynos: chjj: doesn't slicing the tokens remove the .links that lives on your array
[23:07] chjj: Raynos: ah, youre absolutely right

[23:10] EngineerOfPhail: http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/12069 -- Is this async in node.js?
[23:11] DrMcKay: insin: if anything manages to work on Windows, it's pretty sure that it will work somewhere else ;)
[23:11] insin: heh
[23:11] chjj: Raynos: if you absolutely need the "loose" list items as theyre called, you can try cloning from my experimental branch
[23:11] DrMcKay: it's npm module? then rather yes
[23:11] chjj: as far as i know its the only feature i dont support though
[23:11] EngineerOfPhail: Is it a bad idea to run a command from node.js? I need to run a Python script
[23:12] insin: Anyone up for validating that for me by running 4 commands and testing the first working version of an app I'm working on? https://gist.github.com/1155505
[23:12] DrMcKay: EngineerOfPhail: on a website or something else?

[23:13] DrMcKay: insin: give me a moment, I will
[23:13] kepheus: chjj: no I'm stuck since yesterday :)
[23:13] insin: thank you muchly
[23:13] chjj: kepheus: one thing you could do as a solution, would be to try a serial loop instead of a parallel loop, it would be slower, but if the problem lies in making parallel http requests, this would fix it
[23:13] blaenk: hey anyone recommend a good auth module? I've seen everyauth and connect-auth. I want one that is like devise for ruby, in other words, what I see from the aforementioned modules is that they let you login with twitter, facebook, etc. but I want one that basically sets up auth for my site
[23:14] kepheus: chjj: do you know 'step'? I think such a library could be a possible solution (altough I still don't really understand why it does do what i write down :)
[23:15] DrMcKay: insin: damn, my node is too new
[23:15] Raynos: chjj: completely did not work at all
[23:15] DrMcKay: anyway to tell npm to gtfo?
[23:15] Raynos: It did however render everything as one long line
[23:15] isaacs: DrMcKay: oh?
[23:15] insin: sudo gtfo npm
[23:15] isaacs: DrMcKay: --node-version 0.4.10?
[23:15] isaacs: DrMcKay: what is it you want npm to do differently?
[23:16] DrMcKay: isaacs: I want him to pretend that I have different node version
[23:16] Nuck: Weel, shit.
[23:16] isaacs: DrMcKay: --node-version is your tool.

[23:24] chjj: Raynos: i see what youre saying, its grabbing one token too many for you?

[23:24] insin: and doesn't explode your Node

[23:27] creationix: CoverSlide: but it's pretty darn open
[23:27] Nuck: Why the fuck did HP discontinue WebOS?
[23:27] DrMcKay: AvianFlu: package would need something like compileDependencies in packege.json
[23:27] creationix: Nuck: they didn't
[23:27] isaacs: AvianFlu: the problem is that, if you're dynamically linking, it depends on about a million factors
[23:27] isaacs: AvianFlu: os, release, kernel version, gcc version, etc.
[23:27] halfhalo-work: HP discontinued the hardware, not the software, not by a long shot.
[23:27] DrMcKay: s/packege/package/
[23:27] Nuck: Ah
[23:27] Nuck: Well, who the fuck is gonne adopt it?
[23:27] AvianFlu: isaacs: oh I know, I've got an ugly problem here
[23:27] creationix: node on mobile lives on
[23:27] halfhalo-work: it lives on in style
[23:28] softdrink: so they're licensing it to other hardware vendors?
[23:28] CoverSlide: is webos ARM-based?

[23:28] creationix: CoverSlide: yeah
[23:28] Raynos: chjj: That doesn't work for my data. (my data : https://gist.github.com/1155543)
[23:29] CoverSlide: oh ok, so there are compile targets for ARM on node, so it should be portable to other mobile devices
[23:29] creationix: CoverSlide: node is just a small part of webOS
[23:29] creationix: but it is there
[23:29] Nuck: Is this true that HP might be ditching hardware altogether?
[23:30] creationix: Nuck: Not sure about the rest of PSG, but there will be no more HP mobile devices
[23:30] Nuck: creationix: Well, it's what they get for having shitty PCs :S
[23:30] creationix: (rest of PSG = consumer laptops)
[23:30] chjj: Raynos: i dont know what to tell you, it works for me

[23:31] chjj: Raynos: yes, your data
[23:31] chjj: Raynos: i told you before (hopefully) you installed it
[23:31] chjj: i said i was slacking on the npm version and took a second to update it
[23:31] sechrist: creationix: :( I was going to give up my iPhone

[23:32] creationix: I don't care who actually designs the hardware for webOS as long as it's good hardware
[23:33] Nuck: creationix: Well then this might be a good thing.
[23:33] CoverSlide: the question is whether someonw WILL design hardware for webOS
[23:33] Nuck: HP's hardware isn't all that incredible.
[23:33] chjj: Raynos: k, good, you were scaring me for a second
[23:33] creationix: indeed, but it's looking hopeful
[23:33] sechrist: creationix: what is preventing off the shelf android devices from booting webos?
[23:33] sechrist: ignoring modem drivers etc
[23:33] Nuck: CoverSlide: Honestly, I don't think it will.
[23:34] ggg: anyone know the stage of npm for node.js on winows?
[23:34] CoverSlide: weren't they going to ship webOS on their laptops / as an alternate boot?

[23:35] Nuck: Shit works on Cygwin for me
[23:35] DrMcKay: oh, I thought it doesn't work under Cygwin
[23:35] Nuck: Well, mostly
[23:35] Raynos: chjj: I see why it works but I dont really understand your data structure. It's upto you if you want to document what the lexical tokens are.
[23:35] ggg: im tired using cloud IDE, and dont want to use cygwin either.
[23:36] insin: just those random "Failed unpacking" errors, they're killer
[23:36] Nuck: I've been tempted to provide cloud9 IDE instances for my devs.
[23:36] Nuck: insin: Agreed.
[23:36] Nuck: What the fuck is with untar on Cygwin?
[23:36] Nuck: But seriously, can SOMEBODY tell my why Node_mailer is borked for me?
[23:36] Nuck: https://gist.github.com/a6c4e33802a929f478d8
[23:36] insin: my most used key sequence on Cygwin is now easiy up, return, up return ,up return swear
[23:37] ggg: cloud9 is note bad, but i keep getting bugs with the server when i try to use my app
[23:37] Nuck: Seems to be calling SMTPClient as a constructor when it's a native.
[23:37] DrPizza: Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use cygwin.” Now they have two problems.
[23:37] DrMcKay: DrPizza: lol
[23:37] Nuck: DrPizza: That quote... *shakes fist*
[23:37] chjj: Raynos: its simply the most efficient way to do things, theres no lexeme you can have for a paragraph because markdown syntax is stupid
[23:37] DrMcKay: but I actually think that the basic problem is Windows ;)
[23:38] Nuck: Damnit, Regex is Fucking Great(tm)
[23:38] insin: heh, it's still the same problem, just a more detailed one! :)
[23:38] Raynos: chjj: its the .line I dont understand
