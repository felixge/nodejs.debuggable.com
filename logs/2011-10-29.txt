[01:03] isaacs: TooTallNate: what is it you want to force?
[01:03] TooTallNate: the fact that the node version is incompatible

[01:03] TooTallNate: ok that worked
[01:03] TooTallNate: thanks
[01:03] isaacs: TooTallNate: but there's no way to make npm install a 0.4-only lib and a 0.5-only lib at the same time

[01:23] illumina: I'm considering rolling a system that uses setTimeout together with mongo to store start and target times for eventsâ€¦ (it doesn't need to scale beyond 1 app server for now)
[01:23] pandeiro has joined the channel
[01:23] blueadept: you need to create a queue system

[03:24] blueadept: i'm not saying change or anything 
[03:24] blueadept: but, from my experience coffeescript does have its advantages, and it does require changing how you develop 
[03:24] AvianFlu: haha thanks
[03:24] AvianFlu: well yeah, that's how I feel
[03:24] galaxywatcher has joined the channel
[03:24] AvianFlu: I already went through with the pain in the ass that learning good JS was
[03:25] AvianFlu: so... I'll just keep writing it at this point, since it rotted my brain far enough that I understand it well XD
[03:25] blueadept: haha
[03:26] blueadept: well, i think JS has so man good qualities, which i think coffeescript addresses in many ways
[03:26] Asm_Freak: I'm at the point where I can now tolerate JS... but for the last two years, it's been my mantra that any additional line of code adds additional maintenance overhead in the future, thus CoffeeScript helps eliminate noisey lines of code.
[03:26] blueadept: man*many

[03:27] blueadept: coffeescript eliminates code, mostly white space, but it also cuts down on first line characters
[03:28] blueadept: i know that is a small point
[03:28] boehm has joined the channel
[03:28] blueadept: like typing out "function(blah)"
[03:28] blueadept: but it makes a difference 
[03:29] blueadept: again, i think style is a big factor
[03:29] blueadept: and that depends on your own preference 
[03:29] broofa has joined the channel
[03:29] AvianFlu: I've written a fair amount of python in my day, but the rest of my past is C/C++, perl, and JS
[03:29] AvianFlu: so like... braces
[03:29] AvianFlu: I'm used to tehm
[03:29] lyte has joined the channel
[03:30] Gekz: brackets sark
[03:30] daaku has joined the channel
[03:30] blueadept: i don't understand the brackets 
[03:31] blueadept: i think every language can remove them if they wanted
[03:31] AvianFlu: except many languages use them, so many coders learned many or most things using them
[03:31] blueadept: and yet it ands line space and syntactical superfluousness 
[03:32] AvianFlu: and I've heard people hate on indent-based scoping as much as braces over the years
[03:32] blueadept: adds*
[03:32] blueadept: i know
[03:32] blueadept: thats the thing, its like indent v braces
[03:32] blueadept: let's decide 
[03:32] Lingerance: ACTION has seen the following in C: if (...) return; { ... }
[03:32] blueadept: right here, right now
[03:32] CIA-48: libuv: 03Ben Noordhuis 07master * r84bc186 10/ src/unix/core.c : linux: omit superfluous fcntl(F_GETFD) syscall - http://git.io/CDtLjQ
[03:33] AvianFlu: C and perl you can just have blocks, I think, with no keyword per se
[03:33] AvianFlu: ACTION is rusty
[03:33] blueadept: everyone in vote of braces say aye
[03:33] lyte: anyone recommend a particular gzip/bzip2 module? https://github.com/Woodya/node-gzbz2 looks to be the most maintained to me, but there's a whole bunch floating around...
[03:33] lyte: aye :)
[03:33] blueadept: everyone in vote of indents say nah
[03:33] blueadept: 10 seconds
[03:33] AvianFlu: aye!
[03:33] Lingerance: nah
[03:33] AvianFlu: also, blue bikeshed, and scotch on the rocks
[03:33] blueadept: ok that was dumb, we just got 50/50
[03:34] blueadept: thanks #node.js
[03:34] blueadept: you almost decided the history of programming
[03:34] motb: NAH!
[03:34] lyte: two ayes...
[03:34] AvianFlu: I mean, the whole programming world has been voting for 40 years
[03:34] AvianFlu: it's pretty split
[03:34] lyte: now it's 50/50 :p
[03:35] blueadept: fairly split indeed
[03:36] blueadept: but surely, the braces, really?
[03:36] lyte: 4 votes is a snapshot, not even close to significance.
[03:36] blueadept: we have so many indention mechanisms for dealing with break points
[03:36] qmx: blueadept: braces :P
[03:36] blueadept: ^ meh
[03:36] qmx: :D
[03:36] AvianFlu: how many times can I just say "C" as an argument?
[03:36] AvianFlu: XD
[03:37] blueadept: ^
[03:37] blueadept: agreed
[03:37] qmx: AvianFlu: always :)
[03:37] blueadept: lets all go back to C
[03:37] blueadept: C is the future
[03:37] AvianFlu: back to the future!
[03:37] AvianFlu: ACTION gets his delorean
[03:38] qmx: ACTION is reaching flux capacitors
[03:38] blueadept: i think we're on the start of something

[03:39] qmx: you shall not pass!
[03:39] qmx: (nothing against coffeescript, just personal taste)
[03:39] qmx: :P
[03:40] AvianFlu: a lot of us have a lot of various ruby and python experience, I think many of us can read it just fine
[03:40] AvianFlu: I just haven't really bothered learning any yet
[03:40] qmx: it's mostly personal taste imo
[03:41] blueadept: i think ruby is fairly much coffeescript, with some pythonic tributes 
[03:41] blueadept: it can be done

[03:48] AvianFlu: I'm gonna paste a quote, forgive me if it's several lines
[03:48] AvianFlu: A language that doesnï¿½t have everything is 
[03:48] AvianFlu: actually easier to program in than some that do.ï¿½
[03:48] AvianFlu: ï¿½ Dennis Ritchie
[03:48] blueadept: and marak
[03:48] Druid_: hello serverside javascript guys!
[03:48] AvianFlu: stole it from ryah's slide he just pasted, but it fits with what we're talking about here
[03:49] qmx: blueadept: I still think this isn't needed, but if it's optional, go for it :P
[03:50] blueadept: qmx: i've been writing in coffeescript for some time, and compared to pure js, it has huge strengths i think
[03:50] andy_ has joined the channel
[03:50] blueadept: qmx: that doesn't mean pure js isn't any better than coffeescript
[03:50] qmx: yeah, I'm working on mixed-mode (writing both) and for me it boils down to personal taste, IMO
[03:50] blueadept: qmx: but the shortcuts stand out
[03:51] blueadept: really it is taste
[03:51] jsurfer has joined the channel
[03:52] blueadept: and that is the thing, what is your syntactical presence, do you like whitespace (etc), what is your view on how class structure in JS
[03:52] blueadept: preference*
[03:53] qmx: I'm not that fond of coffeescript, even with the shortcuts :P
[03:53] qmx: personal taste :)
[03:53] blueadept: some people like classes in js, and coffeescript is the way, although i'm not necessarily into classes, but i see the point 
[03:53] Lingerance: ACTION does classes just fine in JS
[03:53] qmx: blueadept: for me classes > identation-sensitive code
[03:53] blueadept: i'm beginning to write more of a class structure with coffeescript with backbone.js 
[03:54] qmx: better, for the masses, I don't bother with it
[03:54] blueadept: hehe
[03:54] blueadept: i'm attracted to the prototypical way of doing things
[03:54] qmx: ACTION is a java guy, having prototype-based OO is a bliss for me :P
[03:54] blueadept: i think it has many advantages 
[03:56] blueadept: although, becoming more involved in front-end mvc, i've looked at backbone.js as a solution -- class structure is legit

[11:32] mendel_: not a regexp hero..
[11:33] SargoDarya: Well, afaik as I know express has something to handle static files
[11:33] SargoDarya: app.use(express.static(cwd + '/public', {maxAge: 86400000}));
[11:34] SargoDarya: and     app.set('jsDirectory', '/javascripts/');
[11:34] SargoDarya:     app.set('cssDirectory', '/stylesheets/');
[11:34] mendel_: yeah just need the correct regexp, something like /[^\/javascripts|\/stylesheets|\/images]/
[11:34] SargoDarya: at least I think it was like that >.>
[11:34] mendel_: (everything except /images/* javascripts/* /stylesheets/*)
[11:34] SargoDarya: Why? It's served as static files. I thought express will notice that automatically. At least it does it over here

[11:35] mendel_: yeah, but not if you use a wildcard route
[11:35] mendel_: app.get('*', function() {}); give it a try

[11:35] SargoDarya: why would you do something like that Oo?
[11:35] mendel_: ...
[11:35] mendel_: backbone.js is handling the routing
[11:35] mendel_: client side, not server side
[11:36] SargoDarya: Haven't done anything with backbone. Became a fan of railway.js

[12:17] zomg: Hi, is it possible to get the nodejs shell you get by just running "node" alone, if you run your application? Eg. kind of like having a firebug console like tool to the script you're running using node
[12:17] zomg: Or does something like this need to be done using eval instead?
[12:17] zomg: This is not going to be used by anyone who could break anything by having that =)
