[01:40] bartek: As I sift through obscure errors

[01:55] pz_f: Or should I create a hash table in c++ as a module
[01:58] monokrome: filter?
[01:58] monokrome: or indexOf?
[01:58] monokrome: filter if there might be multiple instances needing removal
[01:59] pz_f: I found arr.splice(arr.indexOf('specific'), 1);
[01:59] monokrome: Otherwise, just get the index of your value with indexO
[01:59] monokrome: f
[01:59] monokrome: Yep.
[01:59] pz_f: Though I need to declare it for ie... stupid dumb s....
[01:59] monokrome: There can't be two instances of the value needing removed, right?

[02:00] pz_f: Although I'd like to create a linked list with pointers in c++ and see if I can use it in js

[02:04] mscdex: pz__: you can also do linked lists in js
[02:04] mscdex: easily
[02:04] pz__: Yes but will they be as fast
[02:05] mscdex: why not?
[02:05] pz__: I don't know, primitives are passed by value?
[02:05] autotron has joined the channel
[02:05] mscdex: objects are passed by ref

[02:05] pz__: Yeah
[02:06] pz__: But I'm not aware of it, I havent really checked it
[02:06] pz__: Would be it possible to template it?
[02:06] pz__: Like make it contain w/e I want?
[02:06] mscdex: var node = function(data) { this.next = null; this.data = data; }
[02:07] mscdex: then create new instances of node and assign .next as necessary
[02:07] pz__: Intersting, I'm new to js I will try to create my own implementation
[02:08] pz__: Right now I need to get an overall functional app haha... then I will focus on optimizing it
[02:08] mscdex: :)
[02:09] mscdex: i've found b+trees work very well too

[02:30] pz__: mscdex: Any module or pure node?
[02:30] mscdex: it's pure javascript
[02:30] mscdex: it's a node module like socket.io
[02:30] pz__: Ok but it isn't socket.io?
[02:31] mscdex: no
[02:31] marcosvm has joined the channel
[02:31] pz__: And why not use socket.io?
[02:32] mscdex: for at least a couple reasons. one of them being i didn't care for the reliance on the url to determine the transport
[02:32] statik has joined the channel
[02:32] mscdex: another one was the transport reliability
[02:32] mscdex: but that may have improved since i initially wrote the module

[02:33] JusticeFries has joined the channel
[02:33] pz__: Well I dunno, I feel like it's a lot of work to do something socket does for free :P
[02:33] mscdex: another difference was i thought about adding support for plain tcp clients
[02:33] pz__: Well seems you have very specific needs
[02:34] mscdex: perhaps
[02:34] mscdex: there's also some design differences too :)
[02:35] pz__: Well I find it convenient, just send objects from one side to the other
[02:35] SubStack: convenience!
[02:35] pz__: Encodes and decodes without me needing to step in
[02:36] SubStack: objects are cool, but you know what's cooler? functions

[10:40] floby: I read about this, what do they do with node at github exactly?
[10:40] V1: But than again, the bigger project running node.js would probably be HP which deploys Node.js in the WebOS platform. Or Joyent with the No.De hosting 
[10:41] V1: When you download tars / zips on github, all of that is handled by node.js floby

[10:48] piscisaureus: pretty awesome, it lets you code & debug in your browser. works very well with node
[10:48] maf: I just got my cloud9ide account
[10:48] maf: I've not used it yet.
[10:48] maf: I didn't know that piscisaureus - that you can code and debug in your browser
[10:49] maf: I better start using it !  
[10:49] gaYak: Does it have autocomplete? ;)
[10:49] gaYak: (does any IDE for javascript..?)
[10:50] floby: gaYak: Eclipse does, but I think eclipse is a pain.
[10:50] maf: funny how such a simple innovation 'autocomplete'  can influence civilization so profoundly.
[10:50] gaYak: floby: Eclipse is always pain ;)
[10:50] maf: I'm back to notepad++ myself.  no autocomplete though.
[10:50] gaYak: maf: It makes bad coders effective! ;)
[10:50] floby: gaYak: thanks for agreeing :D I use vim with snipmate, sometimes the built-in word completion
[10:51] gaYak: snipmate?
[10:51] maf: gay- naw !  There ARE occasions where autocomplete picks something I didn't want.
[10:51] gaYak: (I've used vim as well for all my javascripts for now)
[10:51] maf: is it vim ? that is forever in the war with emacs ? 
[10:51] gaYak: maf: Of course, but it's often handy when there's new library.
[10:51] maf: er, wait, that's vi or something.
[10:51] gaYak: maf: vim = vi.. just a clone
[10:52] floby: gaYak: an equivalent to snippets in textmate. you type a keyword, say 'req' and then TAB. then it expands it to var $name = require('$name'); and ask you to fill in the holes
[10:52] V1: gaYak: Dreamweaver does :)
[10:52] BobFunk has joined the channel
[10:52] maf: I used to use this 'lse' on a vax- I don't use vi/m or emacs, but boy oh boy- people love those tools - again, something so SIMPLE as an editor can influence civilization so profoundly as to productivity.
[10:53] floby: gaYak: not quite true: vim > vi > ... >emacs
[10:53] gaYak: floby: Never used textmate..
[10:53] gaYak: floby: And I kinda like emacs.. k�h.. oops ;)
[10:53] maf: too bad humans don't have 'editors' for their mind.    "Oh no, I hit select ALL and delete and then it crashed, can I get it back ?"
[10:53] floby: gaYak: neither have I but this feature is cool. check out snipmate on vim.org and enjoy.
[10:53] gaYak: maf: Yeah, or undo feature.. ;)
[10:54] gaYak: floby: Yeah, will do, looks promising
[10:54] piscisaureus: yes yes (emacs ^^ node) &~ vim + emacs > (windows - linux * bsd['free']) etc
[10:55] gaYak: Awesome, war! ;)
[10:55] maf: I'm not using node.js YET - I DID just clear off my pr0n for some space on a separate drive for ubuntu so I could finally use VirtualBox on a sep. drive, figured if I use same drive as parent  OS it would be busy busy busy...   BUT the reason I LIKE this channel ? node.js is innovative - I love creativity, and for the most part ? some of the smartest people on freenode in my opinion. 
[10:55] floby: gaYak: well I find the vi/emacs war much more interesting than a Apple/Microsoft war
[10:55] maf: seems the hardest core geeks are here, well - then there is the #scheme channel heh
[10:55] gaYak: scheme.. it's been a while since I coded scheme last time :(
[10:55] squeeks: "hardest core geeks", gee thanks, I went to art school.
[10:55] gaYak: Actually, I'm happy it's been ~8 years.
[10:56] floby: squeeks: I'm still in art school !
[10:56] gaYak: But then again, maybe it's a language for people who're smarter thanme
[10:56] piscisaureus: Yes I am a public policy student. Where are the hardcore geeks? :-)

[10:57] gaYak: Don't think I've ever read it though
[10:58] mscdex: node.js rules!
[10:58] maf: gaYak- you win.  I only can afford free version online, it's like $80 or so for the book. 
[10:58] sth: Except for when it causes a kernel panic like it did earlier :D
[10:58] maf: GaYak - watch the course lecture videos - they're great.
[10:58] maf: I'll get you a link if you want.
[10:58] gaYak: maf: I bought it used when I went to my first Scheme lectures
[10:59] floby: sth: kernel panics are fun. you get a cowsay if you look with attention
[10:59] maf: http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/
[10:59] maf: the first 10 seconds of lecture 1a is worth it for the music and the cover of the book -lol
[10:59] mscdex: oh teh noez! scheme!
[11:00] maf: but he writes 'computer science' on the board, then he crosses out 'computer' saying it's not really to much to do with computers, then he crosses out 'science' - 
[11:00] mscdex: then he sets the board on fire

[11:08] johndahlstrom: I am trying to get the most optimal input matching for a game I'm working on and would want to know what you think.
[11:08] johndahlstrom: Currently I use an event called "command". When someone sends a line to the game, this is emitted and sends with it the whole input line in a callback. In return the listener does a string.match and grabs any necessary matches etc and THEN executes a function if it was a correct match.
[11:08] johndahlstrom: What makes this to not be as simple as I'd want, is that commands will most likely have to be matched with a regexp pattern somehow since they might contain things like a name from an online player and sometimes even starting with one.
[11:08] johndahlstrom: Anyway, I'd just like to check if there's anyone who have a better solution for this? Be it more elegent code or perhaps somehow enable regexp event listeners.
[11:09] SubStack: you could just pass around json objects

[11:22] viktors: plainas: because EC2 doesn't have latency guarantees
[11:22] jetienne: plainas: it is not. 
[11:23] jetienne: plainas: it is a fast, low on resource implementation of js. 
[11:23] mraleph has joined the channel
[11:23] plainas: viktors, sorry, I fail to understand where you're going :(
[11:25] plainas: jetienne, everybody is bloging about how node.js is the revolution of 'the cloud', the node.js lettering even has a small cloud in it
[11:25] viktors: plainas: node.js excels when you need to request a lot of data from multiple sources simultaneously, and some sources have high latency. For example, multiple database requests can be issued at the same time.
[11:26] jetienne: plainas: ok, sorry i dunno why they blog that
[11:28] mraleph: people use what they like to use.
[11:29] mraleph: and don't use what they don't like to use.

[11:32] adamt: plainas, well, node does promote a way to seperate things, and make pararellel executions possible, that might be why.

[11:34] squeeks: jetienne: proud of not being more knowledgable in something else?

[11:35] SubStack: perl is pretty worth knowing
[11:35] SubStack: it's more influential than you might suppose
[11:35] adamt: Everything perl can do, python can do cleaner. :)
[11:35] SubStack: false
[11:35] jetienne: less clean than perl is like ... what ? maybe lisp
[11:36] jetienne: lisp is more cryptic than perl
[11:36] SubStack: can't even do lispy functional pipeline style in python
[11:36] SubStack: because guido doesn't understand functional programming is why
[11:36] jetienne: readability is key, i want to code and forget
[11:36] mraleph: holywar incoming :-)
[11:36] adamt: jetienne, maybe you're finding lisp weird because you aren't used to dealing with recursing and functional programming? :)
[11:36] SubStack: PERHAPS
[11:36] jetienne: adamt: no i find it unreadable because crappy syntax
[11:37] adamt: python isn't a purely functional language anyways.
[11:37] jetienne: python is more readable, but got bogus tabs
[11:37] jetienne: and js is like the cleanest ? :)
[11:37] mraleph: o_O
[11:37] matclayton has joined the channel
[11:37] SubStack: adamt: no but python has mutable constructs everywhere and doesn't have a nice way to thread state
[11:37] squeeks: at least perl can be somewhat optional with parenthesis.
[11:38] adamt: jetienne, the syntax is beatiful, especially if you look at how most compilers are built and recognize the similarities. :P
[11:38] piscisaureus: Ok lets update the equation:
[11:38] piscisaureus: 01(emacs ^^ node) &~ vim + emacs > (windows - linux * bsd['free'])01 / (perl || python) + python
[11:38] adamt: that is, the lisp-syntax.
[11:38] SubStack: adamt: in perl or javascript it's not too hard to string together a bunch of list operations, shell-style
[11:39] SubStack: but in python you've either got to uglify your code with a bunch of parenthesis noise or save the intermediate state
[11:39] SubStack: and I HATE intermediate state
[11:39] adamt: SubStack, i'm not saying Python > Perl for all use cases, but Python is a more easily understandable language, and can do what most people expect from a shell-scripting point of view.
[11:39] SubStack: removing points makes programs easier to debug since you can take them apart piece by piece and try them out in the repl
[11:40] SubStack: whereas with more stateful operations you've got to reconstruct the state in order to test and reason about code
[11:40] SubStack: adamt: python definitely gets some things right
[11:41] SubStack: most of that overlaps with javascript, incidentally
[11:41] adamt: Yeah. But they also do lots of things weirdly.
[11:41] Xano has joined the channel
[11:41] SubStack: I don't care much for the __noise__
[11:41] SubStack: it is a rather novel way to do operators but it seems half-baked at times
[11:42] adamt: when talking about noise, functions named __foo__ :(
[11:42] SubStack: if only in python you could do [].len instead of len([]), and likewise for map, filter, reduce
[11:42] adamt: def __init__(self,bleh): just isn't pretty
[11:42] SubStack: that plus multiline lambdas in python and I would be super content
[11:42] adamt: yeah, it's very silly that stuff like len(..)  is needed.
[11:42] squeeks: I'm sorry, str.join()?
[11:43] jetienne: btw tell those language designers... "hey you forgot about destructor" :)
[11:43] jetienne: they all do ctor, but no dtor
[11:43] jetienne: oriented object ftw
[11:43] adamt: jetienne, false
[11:43] SubStack: it's sometimes nice to hook onto the GC for cleaning up files and hackish stuff
[11:43] jetienne: adamt: which language got dtor ?
[11:43] SubStack: especially where foreign interfaces are concerned
[11:43] jetienne: adamt: i know of c++ but none else
[11:44] squeeks: perl.
[11:44] jetienne: arf :) unfair
[11:44] SubStack: ACTION has done quite a lot of python and perl programming
[11:44] adamt: __del__ in python perhaps, jetienne ?
[11:44] piscisaureus: jetienne: java finalize?
[11:44] SubStack: ruby, haskell, and javascript round out my top 5
[11:45] jetienne: adamt: piscisaureus: ok i stand corrected
[11:45] SubStack: I sometimes miss ruby's grab-bag approach in the core types
[11:45] adamt: also, python got something similar to blocks in ruby that in many cases can remove the need for a destructor
[11:45] hellp has joined the channel
[11:45] SubStack: if only there were a better way to achieve the same ends
[11:46] SubStack: adamt: oh?
[11:47] SubStack: I recall some wonky new syntax that was highly specific and hard to repurpose for more general programming
[11:47] SubStack: that seems to be how most python features turn out
[11:47] SubStack: with() or something?
[11:47] adamt: can't remember what it's called, but i think it's from 2.6 or so, where you can do stuff like open a file, do voodoo with it, and it'll get closed after the code finishes because it's like a ruby block. but clearly it can't be used for the same as __del__, but good thing __del__ exists then. :P
[11:48] adamt: yeah i think that's it
[11:48] SubStack: yeah it requires some __voodo__

[13:15] dune: fusspawn: seems to be working for me in Chrome and Safari. FF 3.6 not so much. Running OS X.
[13:15] jetienne: fusspawn: what is the greensquare
[13:16] fusspawn: Means its one your browser has created.
[13:16] shaunau: sweet
[13:16] fusspawn: @dune, Thanks ive only tested in chrome so far.
[13:16] dune: Gotcha
[13:16] shaunau: runs like a champ on my macbook air - safari
[13:17] fusspawn: Neat, Im kinda happy. Im running it here on a netbook with no lag <3
[13:17] shaunau: i think "MY" spaceships look the best ;)
[13:17] shaunau: way better than everyone elses..

[13:19] fusspawn: Most of my time was getting it running under processing.js and adding the websockets/backend/bigger window part.
[13:20] fusspawn: Also, Processing.js is fast ;o
[13:20] floby: runs fine on my EeePC running ubuntu 10.10
[13:20] floby: chromium
[13:20] floby: I do get a lag every 5 seconds or so
[13:20] shaunau: fusspawn - nothing wrong with that man, we all need to stand on the shoulders of others sometimes :)
[13:21] fusspawn: Either way, Im supprised its not crashing. and i need caffine, brb
[13:21] fusspawn: Cheers for testing all.
[13:21] shaunau: floby - that's just your crappy machine :P

[13:21] shaunau: not to mention ubuntu.. right, ;)
[13:21] floby: shaunau: Desmond is the best laptop I ever had, but it has had some problems lately with the Atom processor

[13:24] floby: let me get a hand on the WebGL demo I saw yesterday
[13:25] jmar777: not a node.js question per se, but are there any compelling reasons to always include a new line after a json response? i've seen some do it, and some don't.
[13:25] floby: there it is http://helloracer.com/webgl/
[13:26] floby: jmar777: I do it. it's because JSON doesn't need newlines. so newlines can be used to separate different JSON objects
[13:26] fusspawn: Three.js:242Error creating WebGL context.  <3 I Hate winfails crappy intelgma drivers.

[13:28] matschaffer has joined the channel
[13:28] jmar777: floby: k. i have noticed when streaming multiple json objects to various clients (tested in multiple browsers and curl) that new lines were required for it to actually incrementally print the objects. otherwise it just waits til the connection closes
[13:29] jmar777: floby: i was just wondering if there was a similar effect in certain situations with a single object as well
[13:29] malkomalko: is there anyway to catch EPIPES? we're finding really randomly our streams are throwing that and I don't know how to catch it

[13:30] GriffenJBS: malkomalko: can you pastebin code?
[13:30] matschaffer has joined the channel
[13:30] mscdex: jmar777: probably just the way it buffers json
[13:31] malkomalko: one minute
[13:31] floby: jmar777: it's technically possible to count the '{' and corresponding '}' but it's way easier to just wait for a newline
[13:32] floby: fusspawn: awwwh, intel GMA :D
[13:33] fusspawn: My othermachine is acient but at least had a nvidia 6800gt in it, but the processor is slower. Its a useless lose/lose situation >.>
[13:33] floby: jmar777: not mentionning the possibility of getting incorrect json
[13:34] mscdex: i used to have a 6800gt before i upgraded
[13:34] floby: fusspawn: when I chose this laptop two of the criteria where, it must have a Atom processor, it must have a Nvidia ION
[13:34] davidsklar has joined the channel
[13:34] floby: I have a 8600gt on my desktop computer... close enough
[13:34] mscdex: yuck, atom!
[13:34] mscdex: :P
[13:35] floby: mscdex: I was looking for a computer that cost less than 350€ (in France)
[13:35] fusspawn: Ions where expensive when i got this. Gma 950 / Atom Something or other.
[13:35] fusspawn: were*
[13:36] floby: I looked at GMA too because most of the machine with ION were more expensive. But this 12" EeePC was a good deal. 326€ at the time. My only regret is that it only has 1Go of memory
[13:37] fusspawn: Now to see if theres a processing runtime for android. Everything needs an android client.     I swapped oit the 1gb stick for 2gb. Helped a ton.
[13:37] jmar777: floby: ya - i wrote a json.org-compliant streaming json parser for framing an input stream a few months back... and then realized that it was already framed by new lines :\

[13:38] jmar777: floby: not that it was a huge under taking, but at the end of the day i couldn't even justify using it cause of the overhead lol

[14:00] msilverman2: Good morning all. We are using node 0.2.6 and will be for a little while longer. We're having a problem with request 1.2.0 where it is not letting go of socket connections. Over time, node gets jammed up because of all the open resources. So, I wanted to try going straight to http. Here's a gist: https://gist.github.com/870740
