[00:29] bnoordhuis: jbrokc: i think on os x it checks for changes with stat(2)

[00:32] bnoordhuis: jbrokc: eh... `mount` on linux shows noatime if the fs is mounted with atime off

[00:44] howdyhi: socket.write(JSON.stringify(message), 'utf8', function() { });
[00:45] howdyhi: Changing this to:  message = JSON.stringify(message); then calling write() seems to have fixed the issue. Does that make any sense to anybody?

[01:32] seivan has joined the channel
[01:33] bksf: i don't mind paying obviously ... but working consulting and this project leaves no time to manage even an ec2 (sucks) or rackspace cloud instance ...
[01:33] rauchg: bksf
[01:33] rauchg: you can disable websocket
[01:33] dreamdust1: ^^ Exactly why I can't deal with managed hosting.
[01:34] rauchg: io.configure(function () { io.set('transports', ['xhr-polling']) });
[01:34] rauchg: the no.de approach is the way to go obviously
[01:34] bradleymeck: just use longpolling fallback etc for now unless you hit true perf problems
[01:34] rauchg: isaacs  is working on it

[01:34] rauchg: in fact
[01:34] rauchg: different antivirus software block websocket
[01:34] rauchg: proxies block websocket
[01:34] bradleymeck: rauchg the no.de approach?

[01:45] rauchg: which made everything more complicated
[01:45] thepatr1ck: being able to provide your configuration as a JSON object: ultimate win.

[01:48] rauchg: ryah separating between environments
[01:49] rauchg: almost _always_ you want different settings
[01:49] rauchg: for socket.io in production
[01:49] rauchg: tahn development
[01:49] rauchg: so the fact that it's built-in is nice
[01:49] rauchg: io.configure('production', fn)
[01:49] rauchg: i would almost say always
[01:49] ryah: even then, it doesn't need a callback
[01:49] tjholowaychuk: express apps should usually have at least 4 envs as well prod, stage, dev and test
[01:49] rauchg: since you want to minify the client, gzip etc
[01:49] bradleymeck: ryah when you get some time to talk about port discovery via something like in carapace let me know

[04:51] jgautier: is it possible to pass in a baud rate to http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.9/api/fs.html#fs.open if i were to use it to communicate with a serial port?
[04:51] mscdex: i'll at least have pywebsocket to test with.... thankfully the chromium devs keep that project up to date

[04:51] chapel: so I moved to beta

[04:52] mscdex: jgautier: i think there is a separate serial module out there for node
[04:52] jerrysv has joined the channel

[04:53] ekryski has joined the channel

[04:54] jgautier: cool, the serial port library is working fine so ill probably stick with that
[04:54] jgautier: any browserify experts in here?
[04:54] daleharvey: anyone know use node cron?
[04:55] SubStack: beep boop
[04:55] jgautier: hahaha
[04:55] nibblebot has joined the channel
[04:55] mscdex: daleharvey: why not use the system's cron?
[04:55] jgautier: so i want to browserify node-serialport...obviously i cant run the c++ code in the browser so ill need to use dnode or something for rpc calls
[04:55] jgautier: is there anyway to auto startup something serverside when a file is browserified
[04:56] jgautier: so when i use browserify to require the serial port it would start the dnode code at the same time
[04:56] _bat: lul
[04:57] jgautier: or any ideas for the best way to do it?
[04:57] SubStack: jgautier: you can just do all of that as you normally would, I don't see how browserify would help or hinder your efforts
[04:57] daleharvey: because I am just running a bunch of batch jobs and have a particular hate for cron
[04:57] daleharvey: I mean, I dont think its even possible to setup a cron on most systems without root
[04:58] mikeal has joined the channel
[04:59] mscdex: i do it all the time as non-root
[04:59] mscdex: on linux anyway
[05:00] jgautier: SubStack how would i "normally" do it?
[05:00] jgautier: or how should i do it
[05:00] mscdex: i guess as long as you don't need to rely on necessarily having the job execute at the designated times, a node solution might work
[05:03] Xeon06_ has joined the channel
[05:04] SubStack: jgautier: just fire up a dnode listener and connect to it browser-side
[05:04] chapel: jgautier: it doesn't matter if you use browserify or not, you can use browserfy cli and make a file and host it on a cdn or something
[05:04] SubStack: you can browserify dnode if that's what you mean
[05:04] meso_ has joined the channel
[05:04] jgautier: i think thats what i mean
[05:05] jgautier: and i want the dnode listener to know about the server in which the code was browserified with

[05:12] _bat: SubStack: I want to make sure browserify can do on-demand module loading efficientlyâ€¦though I know with filters it can do anything :)
[05:12] seivan: damn
[05:13] SubStack: _bat: how do you mean on-demand?
[05:13] SubStack: as modules are require()d they get loaded?
[05:13] _bat: SubStack: maybe modules, definitely bundles
[05:14] _bat: SubStack: the easiest thing, if I read the bundle code well, would be to have an option to leave off the front part of the bundle
[05:15] _bat: SubStack: so an app could have 2 bundles, a first bundle that has the bundle infrastructure, and a second bundle that doesn't have the bundle infrastructure and uses the first bundle's
[05:15] SubStack: _bat: not just that but also I'd have to make require() fetch additional deps
[05:15] yozgrahame has joined the channel
[05:16] SubStack: maybe we are thinking of different things
[05:16] SubStack: I'm thinking browserify should eventually support an entirely transparent non-synchronous require that looks synchronous through AST trickery and restructuring
[05:16] SubStack: and just browserify({ async : true }) on the user's end
[05:17] chapel: well SubStack I think he means, he wants to have multiple files (lets say they are large and he wants to split them up) but doesn't want all the extra require stuff you have in there being loaded twice (or at least file size wise)
[05:18] SubStack: oh that
[05:18] SubStack: _bat: I think you want this: https://github.com/harthur/node-browserify/commit/348604bece36a3d85f91ae4cf46758dedab8e254

[06:25] SubStack: tmzt_: a flow control library?
[06:25] SubStack: depends on the character of the pieces you need to synthesize
[06:25] tmzt_: yeah, and stateful
[06:25] nibblebo_ has joined the channel
[06:25] tmzt_: with server side session
[06:25] tmzt_: an order/checkout process
[06:26] tmzt_: but I'm hoping to make it generic so that it can be reconfigured with configuration or a little bit of node
[06:26] zilch_ has joined the channel
[06:26] SubStack: tmzt_: you might find my seq library useful
[06:26] tmzt_: I also like the one that okcupid proposed
[06:26] SubStack: I'm not sure what you want to do about configuration though
[06:26] tmzt_: right, but I'm not talking about callbacks being called in order
[06:27] SubStack: o_O
[06:27] tmzt_: I'm actually waiting for user action (dnode wouldn't work here though) and then choosing the next step
[06:27] SubStack: just use regular callbacks until it gets too complicated?

[06:28] zilch_ has joined the channel
[06:28] tmzt_: what I want to avoid is /step/1 /step/2 /step/3 and serving a view for each, especially as the flow changes based on the actions changed
[06:28] tmzt_: I'll have to look at that
[06:29] tmzt_: maybe I could play with express and treat a .get() call as a potential callback
[06:29] tmzt_: and then add a seq or similar
[06:29] SubStack: oh you mean some sort of modal form thing
[06:29] tmzt_: it would mean having per user routing, so maybe connect would be better (but I haven't worked with it)
[06:29] SubStack: you want to persist state across an interaction?
[06:29] tmzt_: something like that, it's a prototype of something already done in codeigniter
[06:30] tmzt_: yeah
[06:30] SubStack: what's wrong with just attaching that state to an object keyed with the session id?
[06:30] tmzt_: and encode the sequence of steps/logic in a associative array
[06:30] tmzt_: nothing, this is the controller portion I'm trying to work out
[06:31] tmzt_: I get how to do the model and view
[06:31] apalmer has joined the channel
[06:31] ekryski has left the channel
[06:31] tmzt_: ideally I would like to treat user interaction as events that get handled in the controller and the state updated, then the request is served the right view

[06:32] tmzt_: ??
[06:32] tmzt_: mvc?
[06:32] SubStack: yes I don't find mvc a useful way to think about web architecture
[06:33] tmzt_: right, what about the router callback+events thing I proposed?
[06:33] tmzt_: it is for simple things
[06:33] tmzt_: but the logic gets out of hand
[06:33] SubStack: tmzt_: what you are describing reminds me of snap http://snapframework.com/

[06:54] apejens: davidbanham: I didn't find any a couple of weeks ago, and I ended up shelling out for all tasks
[06:54] AnytimeInnovator: @tmzt_ , thanks for your thoughts & info. Actually in their native Windows support, I hope that it still includes Cygwin paths (as / not just \) and ideally runs in/well-with Cygwin, as I love Cygwin for its Unix compability. What sort of native support for Windows is being planned?

[08:14] sjbogdan: <escii> try: rebaseall -v
[08:15] AnytimeInnovator: davidbanham, thanks for the specific ami-06ad526f reference -- if I can get node.js doing what I need under Windows (I want to kind of use it to replace my Bash scripts) then I'll be quite interested in getting it into the cloud as well, and your free-tier solution sounds great!
[08:15] Murvin: davidbanham: thanks.. :)  let me take  a look at the community page there.
[08:17] davidbanham: AnytimeInnovator: You can't beat free! You could also grab a free image, install emacs and then just ssh in as a development environment.
[08:18] Murvin: davidbanham:  is there a big difference between running on instance storage or EBS?   I kinda know the difference but justnot sure which one I should use. and I just need to run a node.js on it.
[08:18] davidbanham: Has anyone got any experience with git-fs? It's at https://github.com/creationix But the readme seems out of date and I can't make it do a damn thing.
[08:19] davidbanham: Murvin: That one's out of my league, I'm afraid. I'm pretty new to AWS myself.

[08:25] AnytimeInnovator: davidbanham, I was planning to use https://github.com/creationix/node-git or equivalent git and other VCS bindings for node, if I can also use it to control the local machine including Windows. I've already written Bash extensions for SVN & TortoiseSVN to do some nifty stuff, but Bash is too limited --including on Windows your scripts can't get over ~70K and I've already blown that.

[08:47] shenlok_: Hello guys, I was wondering if someone could help me implementing a little feature in node.js. I'm looking to allow an app to send a POST request with a certain word in it, and then depending on whether the node server receives a required amount of the same words in a short space of time, it will respond to each request with "TRUE" or such
[08:48] shenlok_: otherwise if not enough requests were received within the time limit, it would response with an error/FALSE
[08:48] shenlok_: i'm just not sure how to go about writing this in code
[08:49] liquidproof has joined the channel
[08:51] eldios: shenlok_, create a counter
[08:51] eldios: and a timeout
[08:51] eldios: when the timeout expires.. it resets the counter
[08:51] eldios: if the counter reaches the specified amount, triggers the condition you want
[08:51] eldios: I would do so

[08:57] eldios: shenlok_, using that code you won't use real "timing"
[08:57] eldios: meaning that you only increment/decrement the counter when you have a request
[08:58] eldios: think of case where you have a request a day or where you have 1000 req/sec and see what happens with that code
[08:58] shenlok_: yeah good point..
[08:59] shenlok_: so what functions are there for use in JS/node that would allow me to use a proper timing interval
[08:59] shenlok_: I'm afraid i'm very new to JS programming
[08:59] eldios: setInterval and setTimeout as in every JS language
[08:59] eldios: you can also use the Date

[09:10] industrial: so I create a User object and the titles are empty because its an array of titles. How do I add titles?
[09:10] shenlok_: mape: looking at that gist, it will respond with "false" to any request BEFORE the max word count has been reached? as opposed to waiting until the timeout, then responding as appropriate?
[09:10] shenlok_: or am i reading it wrong
[09:11] Nexxy: androoid, also see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodejs for a brief overview :)

[09:12] level09: eldios: it is the best
[09:13] androoid: yes i have checked out rubyonrails
[09:13] gausby: androoid: well, tldr: it's something you use to build servers, such as irc-servers, web servers, etc.
[09:13] level09: just a bit heavy compared to textmate
[09:13] AnytimeInnovator: `3rdEden, you write "child process are not yet working on windows" -thanks for the reply. Anyone, when will child processes on Windows be working? What's the hold up? They will be essential for me to call say subversion commands, and anything else for which there isn't yet a module/binding.
[09:13] Nexxy: androoid, do you find the concepts presented in RoR to be confusing?
[09:13] level09: is it true that ruby is a lot slower than node.js
[09:13] androoid: Nexxy; yes it is

[12:41] xtianw: I would use vim if someone could give me a vimrc that would make it behave mostly like Textmate. So much work to set up.
[12:41] lukstr: random123: so do IDEs :)
[12:42] lukstr: xtianw: in my experience learning to write your own vimrc is a good experience
[12:42] lukstr: so I get to work
[12:42] Aikar: im quite satisfied with komodoedit. it provides great project support. its fastt. doesnt eat alot of memory. and just works smoothly
[12:42] xtianw: I got like halfway there

[13:01] framlin: I use vim every day some times, but ist baehhh .... for huge projects to confusing
[13:01] rhaen: framlin: use the projects plugin, then :)
[13:02] framlin: the most valuable plugin within eclipse is mylin and that is not available for any other editor
[13:02] johnhamelink: rhaen, which is the best projects plugin to use with vim?
[13:02] framlin: and without mylin I would get lost within all that JIRAs ;)

[13:37] bnoordhuis: jonaslund: wide chars: nearly every api call, it's maddening
[13:38] jonaslund: bnoordhuis: umm

[15:37] augustl: I just realized. I'm supposed to have the dependencies installed in node_modules in the package I'm trying to link, no?
[15:38] augustl: or, that would be a solition at least, since npm link will look up node_modules before trying the registry
[15:38] isaacs: augustl: right.  so, i think "pluggable" might be too strong a term here.  but this is defintely a bug.
[15:38] isaacs: yeah
[15:38] isaacs: augustl: so, a workaround, is to go into package-a, and do "npm link ../package-b"
[15:38] balupton has joined the channel
[15:38] isaacs: augustl: and then `npm link`

[15:40] augustl: ah right
[15:40] augustl: was thinking internally pluggable
[15:40] isaacs: augustl: all the problems wiht `npm link` are also problems with `npm install . -g`

[15:41] augustl: ah, I see
[15:41] dexter_e has joined the channel

[15:42] JumpMast3r has joined the channel
[15:42] augustl: so in general it would make sense to resolve similar to what require.resolve does
[15:42] isaacs: and, there should be a way to opt out of that, like a "local only realy i mean it" option
[15:42] augustl: s/similar/in a similar way to/
[15:42] isaacs: ya
[15:42] augustl: cool, sounds like a good solution

[15:58] isaacs: augustl: so, i think the immediate thing shoudl be (if you're interested in making a patch) If installing globally, and there exists a suitable globally-installed dep, skip it.  if linking, and there exists a suitable globally installed dep, link it locally (like install --link)
[15:59] isaacs: augustl: that'll take care of the majority use case

[16:00] augustl: isaacs: since linkng is for dev, and I want to re-link later etc

[16:02] isaacs: i need to see the actual characters to know what why it's failing.
[16:02] ap3mantu_ has joined the channel
[16:03] isaacs: augustl: right, but npm cannot rely on NODE_PATH

[16:04] isaacs: zippy: curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo clean=yes sh
[16:04] isaacs: augustl: because that's how it avoids dependency conflicts.
[16:05] isaacs: augustl: npm should always assume that NODE_PATH is null, and require.paths is gone.  node_modules is all that exist to it
[16:05] zippy: isaacs: THANKS!!!!!!!!
[16:05] isaacs: augustl: that's the safest way to organize deps for node
[16:05] isaacs: zippy: np :D
[16:05] augustl: isaacs: ah, I see
[16:06] isaacs: augustl: nesting node_modules folders is a very powerful solution to this problem, though
[16:06] augustl: isaacs: so, the symlink to the linked npm package in node_modules - should it be a symlink to the symlink? Or a symlink to the resolved symlink?
[16:06] cognominal_ has joined the channel
[16:06] isaacs: there's really nothing it cant' do, it just takes a bit of careful planning.
[16:06] isaacs: augustl: it should symlink to the global path.

[16:12] isaacs: i think that if we 1) link global pkgs when linking, and 2) use the cache if the reg 404's, then your problem will go away, and we'll be a bit more resilient to registry failures in general.

[16:13] isaacs: augustl: i probably won't be able to dig into this this week at all, but if you are interested in doing a patch and have any questions, feel free to ping me.
[16:13] augustl: so npm has a cache parts or all of the npm registry?
[16:14] augustl: isaacs: cool, tnx!
[16:14] leek has joined the channel
[16:14] isaacs: augustl: npm has a local cache of the requests it makes in ~/.npm/<path>
[16:14] leek has joined the channel
[16:14] isaacs: augustl: the lib/utils/npm-registry-client/request.js uses that to do etag caching, among other things
[16:15] augustl: I see
[16:15] isaacs: in some cases it actually doesn't make a request if the cache is fresh enough
[16:15] isaacs: POST and DELETE invalidate the cache of the thing that they're pointing at
[16:15] augustl: is there a npm command to install all dependencies to node_modules when cwd is the project root?
[16:15] isaacs: i've been meaning to split that stuff out into a separate utility, cuz it's pretty general, but it's kind of wired into npm in a lot of places.
[16:16] isaacs: augustl: that's what `npm install` does
[16:16] isaacs: (no args)
[16:16] augustl: ah, of course. The error that my package wasn't in the npm registry confused me
[16:16] augustl: but it makes sense, it's not in the npm registry ,)
[16:16] augustl: ;)
[16:17] isaacs: augustl: and, `npm install --link` will prefer to symlink the globally installed packages if they're acceptable
[16:17] augustl: need to get usted to man npm foo instead of npm foo --help
[16:17] slajax has joined the channel
[16:17] isaacs: augustl: `npm help foo` works, too
[16:18] augustl: ah cool
[16:18] isaacs: augustl: the --help just spits out a usage string, i believ
[16:18] isaacs: maybe "--help" should be like "npm help foo", and -h|-? should do the usage string
[16:19] augustl: Printing "see also man npm foo" also makes sense
[16:19] jarek has left the channel
[16:19] isaacs: augustl: the issue is that the direct `man npm-foo` doesn't work on all systesm.
[16:19] zilch_ has joined the channel

[16:19] isaacs: oh, hey, that's another issue with windows, i guess.  does windows have a "man" program?
[16:19] augustl: neat.. no, not that I'm aware of

[16:57] indutnyw: number two question
[16:57] indutnyw: ryah: SNI should use regexps as server names in the future
[16:58] ryah: regexp?
[16:58] indutnyw: ryah: but I don't know how to use them from C++ side
[16:58] indutnyw: yep
[16:58] indutnyw: '*.example.com'
[16:58] indutnyw: like that
[16:58] indutnyw: with wildcards and etc
[16:58] lukstr: indutnyw: #include <regex> ^_^
[16:58] indutnyw: haha
[16:58] indutnyw: thanks
[16:58] bradleymeck: standard wildcarding is only for prefixes i thought, just having a '.' like '.example.com'

[16:59] indutnyw: bradleymeck: hm...
[16:59] dtan_ has joined the channel
[16:59] krh: *.example.com isn't a regexp

[16:59] indutnyw: s/look/lookup
[16:59] indutnyw: SNI allows you using different Cert for different host names, right?
[16:59] indutnyw: what about wildcard SSL certificate?
[16:59] lukstr: ryah: you want to match multiple domains

[17:56] drudge: you can substitute macvim for vim tho augustl :)
[17:56] doctorm: macvim and gvim are a bit easier to get started with than po vim.
[17:57] augustl: gotta be possible to make js-mode on emacs work for the node/npm guidelines tho

[18:04] isaacs: yeah, that's not so bad, especailly if it's an entrypoint or something
[18:04] figital has joined the channel
[18:04] augustl: shanebo: well, that depends
[18:04] shanebo: yeah it's an entry point
[18:04] augustl: shanebo: I like files that require everything they need to require
[18:04] augustl: shanebo: so that every file in the project can be required in isolation
[18:05] _class_ has joined the channel
[18:05] isaacs: augustl: right, but if module A and module B are always require()'ed together, and can't really be used in isolation, then maybe the interface is just wrong.
[18:06] isaacs: augustl: either one of them needs to just wrap the other, or there perhaps needs to be some C module that depends on the both of them, etc.
[18:06] isaacs: ("C" being an arbitrary name, not referring to the C language)

[18:08] astrax: a stupid javascript question, if I have a function already defined and accepting parameters, how do I give it as callback or do I have to wrap it inside an anonymous function?
[18:08] captain_morgan has joined the channel
[18:08] shanebo: isaacs, and the prob is that I'm *trying* to use a default controller that defaults to a layout and views based on route, while allowing specific controller actions to override said settings. However when I dispatch and fire the specific controller action, if it has a method that has a built in callback (db call, require file, etc.) then the default controller fires before it's called back. Soâ€¦ I'm trying to pass a framework m
[18:08] shanebo: into the specific controller action and from within that specific controller, that callback doesn't exist

[18:10] caiges has joined the channel

[18:15] shanebo: isaacs, basically I'm wondering if there's a recursive way to factor in controller actions with callbacks without have to middleware between framework code and project specific code.
[18:15] shanebo: have = having
[18:15] isaacs: shanebo: this is an express app?
[18:15] shanebo: no
[18:15] shanebo: using connect
[18:16] isaacs: shanebo: ok... i don't actually know connect very well.
[18:16] shanebo: and rolling my own router/dispatcher
[18:16] isaacs: i've only used it through express, which i highly recommend for doing any kind of "serve html to web browsers" type app
[18:17] tjholowaychuk: shanebo what is it that you're wondering about middleware?
[18:17] tjholowaychuk: not sure i get the issue
[18:17] shanebo: isaacs do you have to set layouts, views, etc. and fire a render method in every project specific controller action?
[18:17] johnduhart has joined the channel
[18:17] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: this started at "how do i not have a gazillion require() calls in every file?"
[18:17] shanebo: tjholowaychuk, the issue is two fold
[18:18] caolanm has joined the channel
[18:18] tjholowaychuk: globals?
[18:18] tjholowaychuk: haha
[18:18] isaacs: or: refactor things into more meaningful bits.
[18:18] isaacs: make higher-level apis for the things you're doing
[18:18] shanebo: 1) i'm used to attaching events on window on the front end and using it as my mediator so that my logic stays decoupled. How is something similar possible with node when there's no global?
[18:18] caiges_ has joined the channel
[18:18] tjholowaychuk: we have probably a good 1000 requires or more
[18:19] tjholowaychuk: probably more, it's fine though we still boot in maybe 500ms or so
[18:19] tjholowaychuk: less
[18:21] shanebo: 2) i'm wondering how I can use a default controller that sets a default layout (if not an ajax call), view (based on controller action) and still factor in the probability of actions having nested callbacks before firing the framework controller render action
[18:21] shanebo: tjholowaychuk am I rambling? Or does that make sense?
[18:21] dgathright_ has joined the channel
[18:21] Xeon06_ has joined the channel
[18:21] tjholowaychuk: shanebo makes sense, but I mean that's just basic logic you can build into your connect router

[18:22] tjholowaychuk: gzip?
[18:22] mape: yeah, for node
[18:23] mape: :P
[18:23] shanebo: I have it all built. the only thing that's not working is when my project specific controller action has nested callbacks â€“ the framework controller render fires before the callback does.
[18:23] tjholowaychuk: what about it
[18:23] tjholowaychuk: lol
[18:23] mape: using gzip is still a pita with node :(

[18:24] tjholowaychuk: mape: ah, yeah :D haha I've just ignored that for the last while

[18:24] tjholowaychuk: until it's in core and/or and actually works

[18:25] Druide_ has joined the channel
[18:25] tjholowaychuk: shanebo you can also cache those as an object property to avoid subsequent require() calls
[18:25] shanebo: tjholowaychuk so I'd need to require my framework file in every project specific controller?
[18:25] tjholowaychuk: no
[18:25] vivid007: anyone familliar with using cygwin and node ?  i'm running into an issue with "WideCharToMultiByte"
[18:25] tjholowaychuk: it just really depends on how you want to design your thing but that's 100% up to you
[18:26] shanebo: I want to stay MVC
[18:26] tjholowaychuk: you could have ./controllers/*.js
[18:26] tjholowaychuk: auto-require all those in

[18:28] tjholowaychuk: there's a few ways you could do that
[18:28] anyone has joined the channel
[18:28] tjholowaychuk: you could use the vm module and inject pseudo globals
[18:28] tjholowaychuk: which IMO is nearly identical to just.. having globals
[18:28] tjholowaychuk: but
[18:28] tjholowaychuk: that's one way to clean things up
[18:28] shanebo: dodo. that sounds awesome

[18:29] tjholowaychuk: https://github.com/visionmedia/express/blob/master/examples/route-loading/routes/user.js
[18:29] shanebo: so what's the vm module?

[19:14] iammerrick: isaacs:  at least for me
[19:14] isaacs: iammerrick: it's installing the current project to the global space, as a copy rather than a symlink

[19:49] pixel13: can SSL (read: HTTPS) vhosts be used in Node? 
[19:49] Stunt: I tried installing HEAD version  0.5.2 
[19:49] augustl: pixel13: one apache server can only use one set of https credentials per IP fyi
[19:49] augustl: pixel13: also, if apache uses SSL, it's completely pointless (probably) to have node use SSL as well

[19:50] augustl: pixel13: no you don't =P
[19:50] pixel13: augustl: my vhost setup is based on this https://raw.github.com/LearnBoost/cluster/master/examples/vhost.js
[19:50] augustl: pixel13: why would you need to run the node servers on https when they're only proxied on machines you control?
[19:51] augustl: oh these aren't apache vhosts
[19:51] mendel__ has joined the channel
[19:51] augustl: nvm then
[19:51] Stunt: @japj r u try older build in cygwin ? 
[19:51] pixel13: augustl: main reason is to bypass apache / threads
[19:51] pixel13: ;)
[19:51] japj: Stunt: but the windows support is currently under "heavy" construction, so you might want to just grab the official binary and start from there http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.5.2/node.exe
[19:52] Stunt: jspj: thank you I try this one :-
[19:52] augustl: pixel13: you do have one IP per hostname, ya?
[19:52] pixel13: correct
[19:52] augustl: pixel13: using that lib seems pretty pointless, then
[19:52] pixel13: augustl: and I can only get SSL to work by passing the "options" object into the base var server = connect.createServer(); call
[19:52] augustl: what does it do that's useful?
[19:52] pixel13: which lib is that?
[19:52] augustl: the vhost lib
[19:53] augustl: app.listen(443, ip_one); app2.listen(443, ip_two);
[19:53] pixel13: two separate domains, two separate vhosts / SSL certs
[19:53] xtianw: rknLA: Spider passes the window object to the callback -> window.document.cookie
[19:53] __class__ has joined the channel
[19:53] qard has left the channel
[19:53] augustl: pixel13: since they have to run on different IPs anyway, host name based routing is pointless
[19:53] japj: Stunt: v8 broke in cygwin when we upgraded to v8 version 3.4.14
[19:53] augustl: pixel13: the requests will be routed to different sockets anyway
[19:53] pixel13: aaah, I see
[19:53] augustl: =D
[19:53] fattytuna has joined the channel
[19:54] pixel13: vhost = virtual, which I don't _need_ since distinct IPsâ€¦. DUH
[19:54] augustl: yup
[19:54] pixel13: so does that mean I have to now use multiple cluster(server) objects? (e.g. cluster(server1), cluster(server2) ) â€¦for multithreading?
[19:54] augustl: pixel13: cluster doesn't do multithreading? :O
[19:55] pixel13: er, multiple "workers"
[19:55] b_erb has left the channel
[19:55] augustl: pixel13: ah, then you need to do some proxying thing yeah
[19:55] augustl: pixel13: i.e. run n instances of the actual server on http, and run the proxy with https
[19:55] mendel_ has joined the channel
[19:55] pixel13: augustl: hmmâ€¦yeah, I'd read a little about that
[19:55] augustl: and hope that the cluster lib, or something else, supports https (which would be silly if it doesn't)
[19:56] augustl: pixel13: node is pretty capable of handling a quite large amount of requests though, so unless you're certain you need multiple workers then try without first
[19:56] pixel13: augustl: is it very hard to setup a proxy like that?
[19:56] pixel13: am using ".set('workers', 1)" atm
[19:56] augustl: pixel13: don't think so. You could even use something super optimized like varnish, I think
[19:56] augustl: or no, varnish doesn't do https
[19:57] augustl: anyhow, you could split the two http servers into separate processes, for starters, and see how that works out
[19:57] context: you cant really proxy https requests.
[19:57] augustl: indeed
[19:57] pixel13: yeah, I figured that'd workâ€¦was really hoping to get it all working via one "server"
[19:57] pixel13: works great so far via vhosts w/o https
[19:57] augustl: pixel13: if you use a monitoring system such as monit, having two processes has almost no maintenance overhead
[19:58] context: augustl: or you could just run node over http:// and let your front facing web server (nginx?) handle https ...
[19:58] augustl: nginx is pretty good for being a front end https server to n backend http servers too
[19:58] augustl: =D
[19:58] pixel13: nginx is next on the list ;) â€¦for now, stuck w/ apache
[19:58] augustl: you also run apache?
[19:59] pixel13: si
[19:59] context: pixel13: so have apache do https... node do http...
[19:59] augustl: or just have node do the https, it's pretty good at it
[19:59] pixel13: apache threads are killing us thoughâ€¦ it _is_ doing https
[19:59] context: doing https between apache and node is a waste of resources
[19:59] augustl: indeed
[19:59] skohorn has joined the channel
[19:59] pixel13: yeah, this is an interim fix, at bestâ€¦bypassing apache maxclients limitations, etc
[19:59] augustl: unless you for some reason really need to verify the identity of your cluster servers.. which you probably don't
[19:59] xtianw: rknLA: Maybe tobi? https://github.com/LearnBoost/tobi
[19:59] pixel13: < Node.js to the rescue! >
[20:00] malkomalko has joined the channel
[20:00] augustl: pixel13: I can't imagine node scales https better than apache, really.. The bottleneck on https is mostly cpu and entropy afaik.
[20:00] pixel13: the only reason HTTPS is even a factor is that it needs to run an an HTTPS web pageâ€¦else cert warnings run rampant
[20:01] jvduf_ has joined the channel
[20:01] augustl: if you run a http web site you won't get cert warnings ;)
[20:01] pixel13: it's not https, per se, rather higher connection through put (prevents bottlenecking)
[20:01] pixel13: augustl: hence my dilemma ;)
[20:01] augustl: I should definitely stop talking, I'm not a pro scaler
[20:02] srid has joined the channel
[20:02] augustl: final thought: use two processes, one for each node https server, have node listen on 443, volia
[20:02] pixel13: no worriesâ€¦ anyhow, the solution thus far is greatâ€¦just need to add another domain (e.g. vhost) to the mixâ€¦and that's where I hit the wall
[20:02] whyno has joined the channel
[20:02] augustl: cool
[20:02] pixel13: yeah, I think I'll play with separate processes for nowâ€¦especially if the overhead isn't a factor
[20:02] pixel13: augustl: thx
[20:02] rknLA: xtianw: tobi looks like it could do it

[20:02] confoocious has joined the channel
[20:03] whyno: Howdy. I am sending JSON string across TCP and as I increase the benchmark, I am noticing some packets getting truncated, then the rest of the packet comes in on the next onData event. Is this normal?
[20:03] Paul_tm has joined the channel
[20:03] whyno: Basically two nodes processes, one a TCP client writing() the other a TCP server listening.
[20:04] baudehlo: whyno: perfectly normal.
[20:04] augustl: sounds completely normal to me. But I don't know enough about TCP to fully understand what you mean with packets getting truncated.
[20:04] whyno: Do I need to then add a teminator to my JSON messages?
[20:05] random123: Do the majority of people recommend Jade or EJS? What are the real advantages of Jade? Is the only advantage readability, which you sacrifice for not writing the HTML standard itself?
[20:05] augustl: whyno: no, the packets arrive in order
[20:05] whyno: Its strange though, cuts off exactly the last 5 bytes every message, I am sending the same exact message everytime for my benchmark
[20:05] augustl: whyno: so just append the buffer objects to the previous buffer object
[20:05] baudehlo: yes you'll need some way of delimiting them.
[20:05] augustl: (if I understand this correctly)
[20:05] baudehlo: I suggest network string.
[20:06] augustl: random123: I'm a fan of EJS
[20:06] augustl: random123: I fucking hate hipster templating languages..
[20:06] baudehlo: augustl: presumably the problem is sending >1 JSON object over the same connection.
[20:06] baudehlo: so they have to be delimited.
[20:06] augustl: oh right, indeed
[20:06] sub_pop has joined the channel

[20:08] baudehlo: whyno: just use a network string.

[20:08] baudehlo: or use dnode - I think it takes care of this stuff.

[20:16] darshanshankar has joined the channel
[20:17] baudehlo: whyno: sure, but you can't control or guarantee it.
[20:17] whyno: For example, I would have to split on my message terminator? Currently I have only seen truncatation
[20:17] baudehlo: well they won't be truncated. The rest will come.
[20:18] whyno: So this is a nightmare, don't want to code all this logic of checking for <EOM> then if truncated storing and waiting for next onData, then coding for multiple messages. What is dnode?
[20:18] baudehlo: google it.

[20:43] Vaffles: /clear

[21:51] isaacs: explodes: if you are going to localhost, the https is a bit unnecessary anyway, since it's a loopback, not going over the actual network

[22:45] monokrome: Is there a configure flag that I can use to build NodeJS for a different arch?
[22:45] bnoordhuis: monokrome: it's... difficult
[22:45] monokrome: bah
[22:46] bnoordhuis: you can point ./configure to a cross-compiler
[22:46] bnoordhuis: but the build script contains too much cleverness for it to really work

[23:13] Murvin: I have a situation here.  i have two already developed server (express) running on port 3000 and 3001.  however, now, I need to port them to production in which I'm only allowed to use port 80.
[23:13] alvaro_o_ has joined the channel
[23:14] loveshine has joined the channel
[23:14] Murvin: so, is there a way that I create a simple server onport 80, and then require the code from the two already existing server?  
[23:15] mbrevoort has joined the channel
[23:15] Murvin: in a simple way, wihtout rewriting to many codes
[23:15] tjholowaychuk: Murvin try connect's vhost
[23:15] tjholowaychuk: middleware
[23:15] tjholowaychuk: it's pretty much exactly that
[23:15] Murvin: do I have to run the two servers: 3000 and 3001?
[23:16] Murvin: does it have any performance drawback?
[23:17] tjholowaychuk: the performance loss of invoking one function
[23:17] Murvin: so.. it is not doing someting like http request?
[23:17] tjholowaychuk: no
[23:17] tjholowaychuk: look at the code it's like 8 lines
[23:18] Murvin: ok
[23:18] Murvin: trying to find it in github now

[23:31] Murvin: tjholowaychuk:  let say, if i have an app., and I export it,   then in the vhost.js, I require it and  just do connect( app1);?
[23:31] tjholowaychuk: yeah you just pass a server
[23:31] Murvin: tjholowaychuk:  then what if I want to also use cluster (in vhost).  hmmm
[23:32] tjholowaychuk: you would use cluster for the top-level connect app
[23:32] tjholowaychuk: since it's the only "real" server
[23:32] crodas has joined the channel
[23:32] tjholowaychuk: otherwise you'll need to proxy with nginx or similar to your processes

[23:34] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[23:34] progme: sturvin murvin

[23:35] smathy has left the channel
[23:35] Murvin: tjholowaychuk: in vhost, can i do this:  connect.vhost('10.10.123.13:3001', blog) ?    with port number
[23:36] tjholowaychuk: no it's not a proxy
[23:36] Murvin: OO
[23:36] Murvin: ok
[23:36] Murvin: got it
[23:36] Murvin: Arrrr got it now.

[23:43] Murvin: tjholwaychuk: another question.  let say, I want app.get('/path1/*')  go run app1, and inside app1, it has app1.get('/path1/mycall'), app1.get('/path1/mycall2').  how to handle it easily?

[23:44] markmarkoh has joined the channel
[23:44] CrabDude has joined the channel
[23:44] Murvin: basically, back to origin.  i have two app servers, already developed.
[23:45] Murvin: and then I need to create a new one, running on port 80.  then take request. 
[23:46] Murvin: if the request is get ('/app1/* ')     then call app1 .  and app1 further handles the routing  app1.get('/app1/func1') or app1.get('/app1/func2').  
[23:46] bayousoft has joined the channel
[23:47] DTrejo_ has joined the channel
[23:47] Murvin: same as for request get('/app2/*)  will call app2, and app2 do the further routing.
[23:47] jbrokc has joined the channel
[23:47] tjholowaychuk: i see,you can do that with app mounting
[23:48] tjholowaychuk: connect().use('/app1', app1).use('/app2', app2)
[23:48] DTrejo_: ACTION is at node office hours :)
[23:48] tjholowaychuk: to each app GET /app1/foo/bar looks like /foo/bar etc
[23:48] Murvin: oh..
[23:48] tjholowaychuk: so it's transparent
[23:48] Murvin: ic ic 
[23:48] Murvin: and for  in app1.js,  I just need to module.exports.app1 = app;, right?
[23:49] tjholowaychuk: export it however you want
[23:49] Murvin: how about configuration?
[23:49] tjholowaychuk: exports.app = app;  module.exports = app; etc
[23:49] Murvin: let say app1 has it own config
[23:49] Murvin: app2 has it own config
[23:49] tjholowaychuk: they should retain their config
[23:50] Murvin: and for the top level app, (calling app1, and app2), does it config override the config for app1, and app2?
[23:50] Murvin: or app1 & app2 override the top level app config
[23:51] tjholowaychuk: well the top level connect one doesn't really have config
[23:51] tjholowaychuk: just some middleware
[23:51] Murvin: aarrr. got it.
[23:51] tjholowaychuk: i have to run
[23:51] Murvin: thanks.  clear now. let me go back and code. :)  thanks.
[23:51] tjholowaychuk: good luck
[23:51] Murvin: so much fun playing with node. hhheeheh
