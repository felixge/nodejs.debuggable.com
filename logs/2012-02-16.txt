[00:21] chilts: I've been doing a similar thing recently, but mainly about screensize

[00:21] chilts: wingie: ??? is that question for someone else?
[00:21] wingie: i mean pauls1 
[00:21] wingie: yeah=)

[00:48] diverdude: EhevuTov: i know what the problem is more or less
[00:49] EhevuTov: diverdude, what do you think it is now
[00:49] diverdude: EhevuTov: it has to do with the fact that socket.io actually cannot go through http proxy,...it needs a proxy the operations on a lower level in the osi model i think
[00:49] diverdude: like HAProxy
[00:51] bbbb has joined the channel
[00:51] EhevuTov: diverdude, I'd think it just needs to do HTTP/1.1

[03:55] ritch- has joined the channel
[03:55] timoxley: pilgo you can just have the Model object emit a 'created' event
[03:55] timoxley: or whatever
[03:56] pilgo: timoxley: Ok, great. Could you please point me to the documentation, if there is any for that?!
[03:56] timoxley: pilgo eg. User.post('save', function(user) { User.emit('created', user) })

[03:56] killing-joke has joined the channel
[03:57] joaojeronimo_ has joined the channel
[03:57] timoxley: there isn't really anything, except that knowing the Model is an event emitter and you can use it to emit events using the post/pre save/remove middleware

[03:59] killing-joke: i want to run 'npm install .' in the root of a project i cloned.  i have node 0.6.10 in /usr/bin, and i want npm to use /usr/local/node/$older_version instead
[03:59] isaacs: killing-joke: so update your path
[03:59] joaojeronimo_: What's the best way to know if a file exists before v0.7.x ? ( fs.exists(file, function (exists) { console.log('exists!')}) does not exist before v0.7.x right ?)
[03:59] killing-joke: is there a way to do that?  i didn't see one in the repo or man pages
[03:59] davidbanham: killing-joke: Use nvm ?
[03:59] isaacs: killing-joke: export PATH=/usr/local/node/bin
[03:59] pilgo: timoxley: I'm not sure if there's a better fix to this but basically, I'm getting everyauth to return FB data and the my page loads before the user saves which results in an error.
[04:00] isaacs: killing-joke: or use nave
[04:00] isaacs: or n or nvm or one of the others.
[04:00] killing-joke: isaacs, ah. many thanks.
[04:00] killing-joke: davidbanham, tyvm
[04:00] davidbanham: np
[04:00] isaacs: joaojeronimo_: it was path.exists
[04:00] isaacs: joaojeronimo_: this was the wrong place for it, unfortunately
[04:00] timoxley: pilgo oh
[04:00] timoxley: pilgo when you do user.save() it takes a callback
[04:00] isaacs: joaojeronimo_: the best way is to use fs.stat() and actually make sure it is the sort of thing you want.
[04:01] timoxley: pilgo user.save(function(err, user) { console.log('saved') })
[04:01] joaojeronimo_: isaacs: OK, thanks :)

[04:25] killing-joke: using nave, "Error: npm doesn't work with node v0.4.12"
[04:26] killing-joke: which version(s) of 'npm' match up with node v0.4.12
[04:26] wingie: killing-joke: you mean something like browserify?
[04:26] isaacs: killing-joke: npm 1.0
[04:26] wingie: killing-joke: why do you wanna use v0.4.12?
[04:27] killing-joke: isaacs, awesome. thank you.
[04:27] isaacs: killing-joke: 1.1 uses node-tar and requires built-in zlib
[04:27] isaacs: killing-joke: but yes, don't use node 0.4, it's ancient :)
[04:27] isaacs: killing-joke: if you're in a nave subshell, btw, you can curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh |sh and it'll install the right one
[04:27] killing-joke: isaacs, i have been meaning (for about a year) to thank you for the node-tar

[04:31] killing-joke: so i use 0.4

[04:32] dshaw_: gatorcoder: I think we're on a every other week schedule.
[04:32] SubStack: gatorcoder: there's going to be another one on sunday
[04:32] gatorcoder: excellent!
[04:32] gatorcoder: i will try to catch this one live
[04:32] gatorcoder: i came across it last week on reddit

[04:42] gatorcoder: a nicer sqlite that writes to memory vs disk
[04:42] context: davidbanham: i like how thats a screenshot

[04:43] EhevuTov: red is has a 'make benchmark' or something?I forget where it is, but it profiles a lot of the ways it stores with speed info, etc.
[04:43] gatorcoder: i use sqlite because I can check it in and then pickup where i left off on anohter machine

[05:10] AvianFlu: I like vows... because I learned it and can use it effectively
[05:10] EhevuTov: muk_mb, I know that a new one is Mocha that people seem to like. There are a lot
[05:10] AvianFlu: there's also node-tap, nodeunit, mocha, and others
[05:10] SubStack: ACTION thinks that vows is silly
[05:10] SubStack: in that I still don't *get* it
[05:10] AvianFlu: ACTION thinks that SubStack *would* think that vows was silly
[05:10] SubStack: I like tap
[05:10] muk_mb: there's not a primary one yet?
[05:10] hemanth: what's wrong in invoking a function like global[ param[2] ](param[1],param[3]); where param's are url.parse(req.url).pathname.split("/") 
[05:11] SubStack: or some people like just rolling custom asserts
[05:11] SubStack: but whatever you do, make sure that your thing works with `npm test`
[05:11] AvianFlu: also, TRAVIS ALL THE THINGS!
[05:11] SubStack: ALSO THAT

[05:12] AvianFlu: that's how every test framework starts out! XD
[05:12] riskish has joined the channel
[05:12] SubStack: I like the test harness to guard against certain common bugs that are difficult to detect with asserts
[05:12] SubStack: like not firing a callback at all is the most common

[05:12] SubStack: false positives!
[05:12] dilvie has joined the channel

[05:13] SubStack: or setting a timeout that throws and then clearing it in the callback

[05:13] AvianFlu: but yeah
[05:13] AvianFlu: use a framework XD
[05:13] SubStack: then I realized that if I just used a better test harness it would take care of that
[05:13] dunder-mifflin: doesn't vows handle that? i.e. if callback is not called, then it will fail the test and displays 'callback is not fired'
[05:13] AvianFlu: dunder-mifflin, yes
[05:14] AvianFlu: that's why we're saying test frameworks are good :D
[05:14] AvianFlu: so you don't have to check that yourself
[05:14] SubStack: well *some* test harnesses are good
[05:14] SubStack: some are not as good
[05:14] AvianFlu: lol true
[05:14] SubStack: some are actively bad
[05:14] dunder-mifflin: the problem i'm having with vows is when callback is not fired when i'm expecting it to be fired.. figuring out why often takes time
[05:15] AvianFlu: refactoring vows is a common topic of discussion at nodejitsu
[05:15] AvianFlu: it'll happen
[05:15] dunder-mifflin: AvianFlu: i give you guys my moral support!
[05:15] SubStack: dunder-mifflin: give tap a spin too, you might like it
[05:15] AvianFlu: :D
[05:15] AvianFlu: yeah, tap is quite popular

[05:20] dunder-mifflin: AvianFlu: when you guys refactor vows.. what will be used to measure whether the refactoring result is good enough? i guess it's a generic question re node.js modules.. how should one measure the code quality?
[05:21] dunder-mifflin: AvianFlu: i'm thinking.. measuring cyclomatic complexity could be one metric?
[05:21] baig772: ok :) why do we need server side scripting?

[05:21] mhillsman has left the channel

[07:46] Styles: Yeah by Google
[07:46] astropirate: Don't understand the question o_O
[07:46] Styles: Ok I get it cool. So how would you provide scurity?
[07:47] shancat: Node is a platform. Think of it like writing PHP to run on an Apache webserver or something. You write Javascript to be run by V8 and Node.js is like a library.
[07:47] Styles: Yeah I understand
[07:47] knite has joined the channel
[07:47] Styles: By passing a session key or something? Then load a db module and have it check for for that key?
[07:48] EhevuTov: Styles, I don't think we understand your questions
[07:48] shancat: What kind of application are you thinking of?
[07:48] bbbb: Styles, why do you check for a key, what are you trying to do?

[07:50] EhevuTov: Styles, Node is server-side
[07:50] indutny: Styles: use socket.io
[07:51] shancat: socket.io + express perhaps if you wanted to handle ajax requests.
[07:51] indutny: yeah
[07:51] nerdy has joined the channel
[07:51] indutny: Styles: example indutny.com <- #selfpromotion :D
[07:51] indutny: haha
[07:51] bbbb: Styles, then you will want to keep a session id that you assign from the server side to the browsers, using socket.io from there on it becomes trivial, the session id should be associated with a socket.io connection, this can be done with cookies (pretty standard way of storing a session id)

[08:12] Octayn: I don't!
[08:12] r04r has joined the channel
[08:12] jesusabdullah: you don't want to have to check if the third argument is of type undefined
[08:12] jesusabdullah: Octayn: fxn(undef, 1) and function (undef, 1, undef) should act the same, is the idea
[08:13] bbbb: undefined is a valid value, it can be useful to see if someone explicitly gave undefined
[08:13] daniel`: I think it would be more useful if undefined meant the same as nothing
[08:13] Octayn: Hm
[08:13] jetienne_ has joined the channel
[08:13] Octayn: But then wouldn't the length by 1?
[08:13] Octayn: No
[08:13] Octayn: It wouldn't be
[08:13] jesusabdullah: no, because f(undef, 1) and f(1) are not the same
[08:13] Octayn: Right
[08:14] daniel`: right
[08:14] daniel`: but it makes sense to remove undefineds from the right side, since those don’t affect the other arguments
[08:14] shancat: Why wouldn't you use null if you don't want to set something?
[08:14] jesusabdullah: bbbb has a point though

[08:15] Octayn: What happens if g() returns undefined?
[08:15] Octayn: That is a valid case
[08:16] shancat: Mmmh, I guess so.
[08:16] daniel`: yeah, I guess what you’d want it to mean depends on the context
[08:16] Octayn: yep
[08:16] Glenjamin: when would you care about the difference between null and undefined within the function?
[08:16] Octayn: Which means, up to the function to decide what to do.
[08:16] Octayn: When do you actually *get* a null in es?
[08:16] daniel`: Octayn: yeah, that’s probably best after all
[08:16] Octayn: I'm not that far in the standard yet
[08:17] r04r has joined the channel
[08:17] shancat: To me, if you pass something explicitly pass something undefined then there's an error in your program logic.
[08:17] shancat: Whereas if you pass something null then you are saying "hey, look, I'm purposely saying I don't want this."
[08:18] daniel`: sometimes it’s nice to have two levels of nothingness, though
[08:18] Octayn: ACTION digs out ecma262
[08:18] mytrile has joined the channel
[08:18] bbbb: shancat if you pass undefined, it means you don't care in my book, null means you want it empty, and you should almost always use double equals when checking against null
[08:19] bbbb: ppl loves them some tripleeqs but it can bite you
[08:19] daniel`: undefined means "implicit nothing", null means "explicit nothing"
[08:20] shancat: function add (a, b, c) { return a + b + c; }
[08:20] shancat: add(1, 2, 3) === 6
[08:20] shancat: add(1, 2, null) === 3
[08:20] shancat: add(1, 2, undefined) == NaN
[08:20] shancat: I guess, that's what I'm trying to get across.

[08:28] r04r has joined the channel
[08:28] bbbb: Gekz, none, thats the point

[08:28] bbbb: it doesnt have the default properties even

[09:01] benvie: it doesn't
[09:01] benvie: catbot does
[09:01] Octayn: ah
[09:01] benvie: it's not a v8 thing
[09:02] benvie: it's a catb0t thing
[09:02] Octayn: It's definitely in spidermonkey
[09:02] catb0t: thing Node can interface with that code in a method of functions to operate on them , but I have three globals, I expect that calling some article saying its amazing
[09:02] benvie: jere
[09:02] shancat_: method == function?
[09:02] Octayn: No
[09:02] benvie: v8 contexts have the following, in entirety
[09:02] Octayn: Well
[09:02] Octayn: shancat_: a function is a method if it is the property of an object

[09:11] benvie: except they exist live
[09:11] benvie: and can be chanfed
[09:11] shancat_: A little bit of python.
[09:11] Octayn: Python has prototypical inheritance too
[09:12] Octayn: They just sugar it up a bit
[09:12] booyaa: benvie: agreed dude, but he gets you on a good footing

[09:18] shancat_: Like in php and javascript I guess.
[09:18] robinduckett: shancat_: putting a _ doesn't make it private
[09:18] robinduckett: in php or javascript.
[09:19] robinduckett: it's inferred as an internal method but it can still be called

[10:06] vdemedes: Just create simple models, and operate with them, skipping lower level interactions
[10:07] vdemedes: Take a look at simple model with validation: http://cl.ly/011v3i0m020B0m240m17

[10:09] fr0ggie: dontwork
[10:10] vdemedes: Octayn: It is more pleasure to work with it from CoffeeScript, because I use its extending capabilities extensively
[10:10] Octayn: That isn't what I asked :)
[10:10] vdemedes: and code will be much clear
[10:10] JohnFoo has joined the channel
[10:11] vdemedes: Octayn: well, I did not use it with JS, but it will not be a problem, you will just need to use CoffeeScript's extending mechanism and create classes correctly
[10:11] vdemedes: Octayn: if that's still not what you wanted to ask, then I don't get
[10:12] Octayn: No, that's sufficient
[10:13] JohnFoo: Hello. What is the best way to share the db connection between the route handlers in express?
[10:13] JohnFoo: Can I attache the connection to the req object? Or is there a better way? Or attach it direct to the app object?
[10:13] JohnFoo: Sorry, I'm a noob...
[10:14] vdemedes: JohnFoo: I set global variable, because I need to access it across tens of files
[10:14] vdemedes: controllers, models, etc

[10:53] Octayn: vdemedes: As an aside, in the example, is Posts an array? Why don't you use .forEach instead of simple iteration?
[10:53] vdemedes: Octayn: no need :-) it is synchronous operation/block, why should I use forEach?
[10:53] Octayn: vdemedes: It's prettier and more functional. .forEach isn't just for async you know, I use it all the time for sync code
[10:54] vdemedes: Octayn: Post is a model, it is function
[10:54] Octayn: Right
[10:54] vdemedes: Octayn: ah, I tried to avoid a lot of callbacks

[17:27] samsonjs has joined the channel
[17:27] wdbl: SubStack: yeah and the harmony semantics are pretty similar to CommonJS. They just use reserved keywords instead of functions. I don't see the big deal.

[17:30] isaacs: wdbl: they all do roughly the same thing:
[17:31] wdbl: it's: import {foo, bar} from Baz
[17:31] isaacs: 1. map a name to a resource (url or file path)
[17:31] isaacs: 2. require() gives you the module.exports from that file.
[17:31] isaacs: and that's it
[17:31] elijah-m_ has joined the channel
[17:31] wdbl: how would you import foo, bar from Baz with node's module system?
[17:31] PatrickNegri: Any1 can help me with something? I am trying to organize better my code. Inside a class/method. I want to declare there a variable, called OAuthObject. Then i want to call another method that has access to this variable without passing it as a parameter. If the function is inline this works. Made it working only by using this.xyz, but then the var conflicted with simulteaneous use.
[17:31] wdbl: It'd take three lines of code
[17:31] SubStack: wdbl: you wouldn't because that's stupid
[17:31] isaacs: wdbl: what would be nice is to declare a module by doing module { .... }
[17:32] SubStack: wdbl: or you could use the new slice syntax for vars that's in harmony
[17:32] wdbl: right so, then why do you care that "import {foo, bar} from Baz" seems complicated to you, if you're never going to use it?
[17:32] isaacs: wdbl: and then require('foo') gives you the exports defined in the foo resource's module block

[17:32] SubStack: which is why harmony modules need to die in a fire
[17:33] wdbl: incorrect
[17:33] SubStack: wdbl: but there is ALREADY slice syntax for var and let in harmony
[17:33] pyrotechnick: typeof null -> "object"
[17:33] wdbl: @isaacs: you're not going to do that though. You're giong to do: import foo from Baz
[17:33] pyrotechnick: hmm
[17:34] SubStack: so why the fuck does import need to be so fancy
[17:34] CoverSlide: not saying all of harmony sucks
[17:34] SubStack: I don't understand this at all
[17:34] isaacs: wdbl: but why should my var have to be named the same as it is in the Baz resource?
[17:34] CoverSlide: typeof null is actually a good idea
[17:34] SubStack: the hands, they don't know what the other is doing
[17:34] isaacs: wdbl: that's actually the broken bit.
[17:34] SubStack: isaacs: ALSO EXACTLY THIS
[17:34] wdbl: @isaacs: that was just my example. It doesn't have to be named the same
[17:34] isaacs: wdbl: how do you do this in harmony?  var up = require('url').parse;
[17:34] Sly__: Instead of trying to make major changes to the language, they should make simplistic changes to extend the language.
[17:35] isaacs: wdbl: var up = import parse from url?
[17:35] Sly__: Not try to rewrite it and make everyone re-learn how to use Javascript.
[17:35] Sly__: That shit's annoying.
[17:35] SubStack: of course I should expect that isaacs can spot a crappy module system from far away
[17:35] hunterloftis has joined the channel
[17:35] wdbl: @isaacs: oh I see what you're saying there. Yeah I see that complaint...
[17:35] Sly__: Things like... `var [var1, var2] = ['value1', 'value2']`
[17:35] Sly__: That would be nice to have.
[17:35] isaacs: wdbl: what do you do when two modules export something by the same name?
[17:35] wdbl: @isaacs: if that's the case (naming must match), that kinda sucks for a dynamic language
[17:35] SubStack: Sly__: that is already in there
[17:35] CoverSlide: pattern matching would kick ass
[17:35] isaacs: wdbl: import should return a single object, period, not dump garbage into the namespace.
[17:36] isaacs: it should be RHS expression.
[17:36] Sly__: Hm. Never fucked with it before, SubStack.
[17:36] hunterloftis: 1) Installed OSX package from nodejs.org, 2) installed n globally via npm, 3) "sudo n 0.4.11" <-- a bunch of "cp: /usr/local/lib/node//request: No such file or directory" errors ... any tips?
[17:36] SubStack: which makes the magical import syntax all the more fucking ridiculous
[17:36] gsmcwhirter has joined the channel
[17:36] CoverSlide: it's only on spidermonkey now
[17:36] CoverSlide: i don't think v8 even has a flag for it
[17:36] wdbl: @isaacs: ok well I don't think it just dumps stuff into your namespace
[17:36] isaacs: wdbl: import * from foo
[17:36] wdbl: @isaacs: here's the renaming example. I don't see the problem with it at all - import { draw: drawShape } from shape;
[17:36] Sly__: > var [var1, var2] = ['value1', 'value2'];
[17:36] Sly__: ...
[17:36] eeemsi: hunterloftis: 0.4.11?
[17:36] isaacs: wdbl: that dumps crap into your namespace, yes.
[17:36] Sly__: Doesn't work for me @ SubStack.
[17:36] CoverSlide: how about import foo.*
[17:36] wdbl: if you want to import 2 things and rename them, you can.
[17:37] isaacs: wdbl: import Foo from foo <-- like var Foo = require('foo').Foo
[17:37] hunterloftis: eeemsi: Yes, that's the version of a project I'm switching to
[17:37] wdbl: if you don't want to, then done.
[17:37] isaacs: wdbl: but without hte choice of how to name them.
[17:37] wdbl: *then don't.
[17:37] trose has joined the channel
[17:37] isaacs: it ends up being MORE cruft than the current system.
[17:37] eeemsi: hunterloftis: dont - security reasons
[17:37] wdbl: you have a choice of how to name them...
[17:37] isaacs: wdbl: not without a separate line where you assign it to a different var.
[17:37] SQLServerIO: so I'm modeling a hierarchy. I'm currently using mongodb and the best method I've found basically duplicates data in each child node to store the parent and ancestor chain. Does redis handle this any better?
[17:37] hunterloftis: eeemsi: The project is already on 0.4.11. It's an existing project. Thus, n
[17:38] wdbl: @isaacs: that's node's limitation isn't it?
[17:38] eeemsi: ok
[17:38] isaacs: import Foo from foo as fooFoo; < var fooFoo = require('foo').Foo;
[17:38] hunterloftis: eeemsi: I agree though the new branches are much nicer ;)
[17:38] SubStack: isaacs: I know right? they call the magic to use a different export name "local renaming"
[17:38] SubStack: what in the fucking fuck that is terrible
[17:38] hunterloftis: eeemsi: But I do want to be able to go back and work on old stuff, haven't seen this error before with n
[17:38] wdbl: @isaacs: to import 2 things and rename them in harmony, isn't it: import {xRenamed: x, yRenamed: y} from "foo.js"
[17:39] isaacs: wdbl: i lost track of that spec.
[17:39] isaacs: wdbl: it made me too sick to go on

[17:40] Sly__: I don't understand why they're trying to implement Java into Javascript, to put into browsers..
[17:40] Sly__: Can you say exploit much?
[17:40] Sly__: Drive by download much?
[17:40] eeemsi: hunterloftis:  /usr/local/lib/node//request is that valid?
[17:40] AvianFlu: if I wrote a blog post called "Things I'm glad I left in other languages", it would look a lot like harmony

[17:41] dgathright has joined the channel
[17:41] Sly__: wdbl, if they're not trying to implement Java -- why are they attempting to copy its syntax?
[17:41] Sly__: Why not come up with something original?
[17:41] Sly__: Something simplistic?
[17:41] Stephen: It's the CoffeeScript "get rid of excess synatx" craze
[17:41] wdbl: Sly__: what syntax?
[17:41] Sly__: "import * from shit"
[17:41] CoverSlide: LISP IS SUPERIOR TO [insert language here]!!! DISCUSS!!!
[17:41] Sly__: etc. etc.
[17:41] SubStack: Stephen: s/get rid of/invent even more/
[17:42] wdbl: Sly__: python has an import statement too
[17:42] wdbl: Sly__: does that make python Java?
[17:42] SubStack: I'm all for getting rid of syntax
[17:42] wdbl: it's such a superficial argument, that the addition of a single keyword turns the whole language into Java
[17:42] isaacs: wdbl: actually, there were some class proposals that looked quite nice.
[17:43] eeemsi: hunterloftis: and n is what exactly? a npm or the alias for nodejs?
[17:43] isaacs: wdbl: making javascript more like java actually doesn't bother me too much
[17:43] isaacs: wdbl: language features need to be valued based on their merits.
[17:43] isaacs: and this one sucks.
[17:43] wdbl: me neither. the language needs some more standardized structuring.
[17:43] Sly__: Erm. I never said that *one* keyword turned it into Java. I said that it seems they are trying to implement Java into Javascript with the methods they are introducing.
[17:43] wdbl: Sly__: ok, what else? classes I presume?

[17:46] Sly__: They're introducing a lot more than just what you've been focusing on for the past 20 minutes.
[17:46] isaacs: Sly__: if anythign, there are different cohorts within tc39 warring over whether to turn javascript into something more like self, ruby, java, or c#
[17:46] isaacs: or python
[17:46] Sly__: ^
[17:46] Sly__: This.
[17:47] Sly__: Which leads back to what I was saying originally, before some brat had to prove his worthiness..
[17:47] Sly__: Why?
[17:47] CoverSlide: let's just turn javascript into AS3
[17:47] CoverSlide: e4x ftw!
[17:47] wdbl: Sly__: right. and you kept complaining that Js is being turned into Java without even knowing why you were complaining about it because you gave one lousy example and then you had to look up the rest of your complaint somewhere.

[17:51] CoverSlide: maxogden: i hope corndog is not a euphemism
[17:51] wdbl: Sly__: please give us all the examples of how Js is becoming Java...I want to know why you think that.
[17:51] maxogden: no i literally handed him a corndog and he ate it
[17:51] CoverSlide: the good parts in ES6 i wouldn't call 'amazing', more like 'about fucking time'
[17:51] wdbl: Sly__: so far, you've given one example. import.
[17:52] Sly__: wdbl, point being: hit me up when you're part of the TC39 team and can say *FOR CERTAIN* that a feature is going to be implemented, before you start an entire argument in a channel about something that you aren't *SURE* is going to happen.

[20:10] SubStack: creationix: dnode-protocol intentionally doesn't do JSON
[20:10] CoverSlide: buffers i would assume are out of the question

[20:11] SubStack: oh wait it does
[20:11] stisti_: EhevuTov: ab has worked for me on mac
[20:11] SubStack: but it's in a very specific place

[20:18] markbao: EhevuTov: it's in another module other than mine - redis, to be exact
