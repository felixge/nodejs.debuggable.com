[00:00] drudge: good luck

[00:02] Spencer__: when i type $ node simpleserver.js          it sais Error
[00:03] Tobsn: most people here are probably on a mac so they can run it native within the system or use a server
[00:03] Tobsn: im sure it doesnt just say "Error"
[00:03] Spencer__: : Cannot find modelue '/home/lilfarmer/node/simpleserver.js'
[00:03] Spencer__: im on windows 7
[00:03] Tobsn: that has not much to do with the OS
[00:04] kristsk: world of pain is where you are at, Spencer__.
[00:04] Tobsn: whats modelue?!

[00:05] aw2xcd: been looking for some example code for a file upload, but cant find any
[00:06] kristsk: aw2xcd, like with POST request?
[00:06] Spencer__: the file is sitting on the desktop right now, i dont know where the /node/ folder is
[00:06] blueadept: http://pastie.org/private/qb6osgikhsbjqdzeif96w anyone know why i might be getting this 'product is not defined' even though in my app.get it is clearly defined as 'var product =' ?
[00:06] aw2xcd: yea, tryn to use formidablebut it doesnt show how to save the file to the fs
[00:06] Tobsn: how did you install it?
[00:06] drudge: Linkinus yay
[00:07] Tobsn: (i dont even know how cygwin works... i think the last time i tried that out was in 2001)
[00:07] Tobsn: drudge, tell me how to close an inspector window
[00:07] Spencer__: this is how i installed it https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Building-node.js-on-Cygwin-%28Windows%29
[00:07] drudge: in linkinus?
[00:07] Tobsn: yeah
[00:07] drudge: cmd-i
[00:08] Tobsn: it just meeps
[00:08] Tobsn: MEEEEP
[00:08] Tobsn: when i try to close it
[00:08] aw2xcd: Spencer, I had trouble with paths too on ubantu. mine got installer to /local
[00:08] Tobsn: i can focus it but i cant close
[00:08] drudge: i've never seen that before
[00:08] Tobsn: me neither
[00:08] Tobsn: it just stays open
[00:08] Tobsn: showing me channel details
[00:08] drudge: anything in console?
[00:08] Tobsn: when i switch it changes content
[00:08] mcantelon has left the channel
[00:08] Tobsn: nah
[00:08] drudge: huh
[00:08] Tobsn: its odd
[00:08] drudge: do you have detaching enableD?
[00:09] Tobsn: dont think so
[00:09] Tobsn: if i click the X it meeps too
[00:09] drudge: that is pretty nuts
[00:09] gazumps has joined the channel
[00:09] Tobsn: it doesnt like to be touched.
[00:09] Tobsn: ;)
[00:09] Tobsn: yeah its odd, very odd
[00:09] Tobsn: happend a couple hours ago
[00:09] drudge: i'd expect something to log in the console.app
[00:09] drudge: since we always log the errors
[00:10] Spencer__: thanks     aw2xcd   that gets me a little closer
[00:10] Tobsn: how do i check that?
[00:10] thegreatape has joined the channel
[00:11] drudge: Tobsn: open Console.app (via spotlight or /Application/Utilities/Console.app
[00:11] Tobsn: its open
[00:11] beckje01 has joined the channel
[00:11] drudge: goto all messages in the sidebar , then search for Linkinus
[00:11] Tobsn: which log is it?

[00:11] drudge: wtf is that o.O
[00:12] Tobsn: everything else is pruning
[00:12] Tobsn: that fits the time when it happend
[00:12] Tobsn: around 5 hours ago
[00:12] aw2xcd: spencer,  whereis node node: /usr/sbin/node /usr/local/bin/node /usr/local/lib/node

[00:13] Spencer__: C:/cygwin/home/usr/node
[00:14] gazumps has joined the channel
[00:14] Tobsn: like when i sample it just grabs a snapshot right?
[00:15] Tobsn: how would i be able to click the X and at the same time sample? hehe
[00:15] drudge: it should grab a sample of a few seconds
[00:15] drudge: to give you enough time to click it
[00:17] Tobsn: http://pastebin.com/jYY8cDSJ
[00:17] Tobsn: i clicked a couple times
[00:17] Tobsn: while it was showing the progress bar
[00:18] drudge: well that's not helpful :(
[00:18] Tobsn: hehe
[00:18] Tobsn: cant find anything?
[00:18] drudge: curious, if you enable detaching under prefs > status
[00:18] drudge: and you restart, does it persist?
[00:18] Tobsn: well if i restart i assume it will be gone
[00:18] Tobsn: sure i shouldnt do anything else before i restart?

[00:27] Tobsn: drudge, any last ideas cause if not im restarting the app
[00:27] Tobsn: ;)
[00:27] drudge: that sample doesn't show much
[00:27] Tobsn: hmm
[00:27] drudge: i mean i could be an issue with the IPC but the samples don't show it
[00:27] tjholowaychuk: blueadept: is products.find() async?
[00:27] Tobsn: is there any other way to close such windows?
[00:27] Tobsn: or any way to lock them?
[00:27] pHcF: anyone interested in helping with https://github.com/pedrofranceschi/Blogode ?
[00:27] tjholowaychuk: blueadept: oh I see products is undefined
[00:27] samcday: Is it sad that I can jump directly to a node.js core file on github from the address file? :P
[00:27] Tobsn: maybe some shortcut i hit
[00:28] tjholowaychuk: blueadept: you have "products" not "product" as the key
[00:28] Tobsn: pHcF, dont use mysql plz ;)
[00:28] pHcF: lol
[00:28] Tobsn: :P
[00:28] Tobsn: just use mongodb
[00:28] tjholowaychuk: blueadept: res.render('products/show', { product: product })
[00:28] pHcF: i dont like mysql too
[00:28] drudge: Tobsn: no, cmd-i should toggle the window
[00:28] jesusabdullah: I hear mongodb is web scale
[00:28] pHcF: the thing is that many people are used to it :/
[00:29] tjholowaychuk: blueadept: or if you have several as an array, res.partial('products/show', products)
[00:29] Tobsn: ⁄oh interesting
[00:29] Tobsn: the buttons within the window dont work either
[00:29] Tobsn: its like the whole thing is locked
[00:29] drudge: pHcF: have you seen mysql-oil?
[00:29] blueadept: tjholowaychuk: refresh it, i included the find function
[00:29] Tobsn: oh it gets even more interesting - if i try to minimize the main window it meeps too
[00:29] blueadept: yeah it's an array
[00:29] pHcF: drudge: nope
[00:29] tjholowaychuk: blueadept: k then try res.partial like i mentioned
[00:29] tjholowaychuk: blueadept: render() doesn't handle iteration
[00:29] drudge: pHcF: it's on githbu
[00:30] tjholowaychuk: partial() does
[00:30] drudge: pHcF: it's on github
[00:30] blueadept: ah
[00:30] blueadept: awesome, let me try it
[00:30] pHcF: drudge: oh, seems to be nice :)
[00:30] pHcF: i was thinking about creating something like activerecords for nodejs
[00:30] drudge: yeah it's pretty nice
[00:30] pHcF: but with migrations support
[00:30] drudge: if you gotta use mysql :P
[00:30] pHcF: nope
[00:30] pHcF: hehehe
[00:30] drudge: mongoose is nice, check it out
[00:31] pHcF: mysql, sqlite
[00:31] pHcF: im using mongoose
[00:31] Tobsn: yep
[00:31] Tobsn: do mongoose

[00:32] Tobsn: i cant even close or minimize linkinus itself
[00:32] Tobsn: it blocks the whole thing
[00:32] Tobsn: yep
[00:32] Tobsn: linkinus X button meeps
[00:32] drudge: wow
[00:33] Tobsn: i tell you, something is waiting for input
[00:33] Tobsn: man thats odd
[00:33] drudge: it sounds like IPC is fucked
[00:33] Tobsn: yep
[00:33] Tobsn: but i bet i caused that
[00:33] Tobsn: i hit some shortcuts within linkinus by accident
[00:33] drudge: if you can replicate it i'd be really curious :)
[00:33] Tobsn: i bet i cant haha
[00:33] drudge: you can enable detach and restart the UI
[00:34] drudge: you shouldn't lose anything, including your connections to irc
[00:34] Tobsn: if i right click the channel tabs all options are greyed out
[00:34] matt729 has joined the channel
[00:34] drudge: yeah that sounds like IPC isn't communicating
[00:34] Tobsn: also on the query tabs
[00:34] drudge: between agent and UI
[00:35] Tobsn: but its still updating the inspector window
[00:35] Tobsn: when i switch tabs
[00:35] drudge: yeah and still sending messages
[00:35] drudge: yet it thinks it's not connected..
[00:35] Tobsn: and context within right nick list works too
[00:35] Tobsn: also context within chat window

[00:51] JimBastard: im working on a CLI tool that im trying to target for users who may not have node installed

[00:53] AAA_awright: drudge: Install a particular version of Node.js and libraries
[00:53] italic: i'm just trying to understand how it works underneath. http.Server() does create something, is it just not a correct instantiated server object?

[02:26] Tobsn: http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Geospatial+Indexing
[02:26] Tobsn: ever anyone though about that this means you can save 1,000,000,000 * 1,000,000,000 datapoints
[02:27] Tobsn: on a 2d square
[02:31] techwraith: Tobsn: What usecase were you thinking of?
[02:31] Tobsn: i have no idea
[02:31] Tobsn: 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 datapoints on a square
[02:31] Tobsn: with the capability of doing a distance search build in
[02:32] techwraith: Tobsn: I wonder if that would be faster than 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 in a regular list...
[02:32] Tobsn: i think so
[02:32] Tobsn: cause its a 2d map
[02:32] Tobsn: well at least as fast as inserting two ints
[02:32] Tobsn: if you select a single point
[02:33] techwraith: I think it would probably work best with things that have an x -> y relationship
[02:33] techwraith: I wonder if it would work for storing analytics: y = event id, x = time
[02:34] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[02:34] Tobsn: or a 6.25 × 1016 size big image assuming you need 8 bits per pixel
[02:34] techwraith: lol
[02:34] Tobsn: 10^16
[02:35] techwraith: I've been contemplating using it for the obvious use case: a map for a game
[02:35] Tobsn: well it only gives you a benefit if you need distances
[02:35] techwraith: I would :)
[02:35] Tobsn: but yeah a game map would be obviously interesting
[02:35] Tobsn: you can even go 3d
[02:35] Tobsn: with more than one collection
[02:35] techwraith: Yeah, that's what I was hoping
[02:36] Tobsn: wait no the image thing is retarded
[02:36] techwraith: lol, I wonder if I could do Minecraft in Mongo, Node, and Canvas
[02:36] Tobsn: you can save a imagine the size of 1,000,000,000 * 1,000,000,000 pixels
[02:36] Tobsn: yeah
[02:36] Tobsn: you could index every single block
[02:36] techwraith: That was the plan, lol
[02:36] Tobsn: you could calculate travel distance over layers
[02:37] techwraith: Not to mention use it for visibility
[02:37] Tobsn: hmm?
[02:37] techwraith: Say I'm standing somewhere, I need to mark all blocks within x as visible
[02:37] techwraith: easy to do with a geo-spacial db
[02:38] techwraith: db.blocks.find( { loc : { $near : [50,50] , $maxDistance : 128 } } )
[02:39] Tobsn: well i think the map format is accessable
[02:39] Tobsn: cause there are all those tools
[02:40] Tobsn: the only problem is that minecraft maps are endless
[02:40] techwraith: Yeah, but I wanted to write a clone from scratch :)
[02:40] Tobsn: lol
[02:40] Tobsn: but it would get complicated hehe
[02:40] Tobsn: if its 200 blocks high
[02:40] techwraith: And make it massively multiplayer
[02:40] Tobsn: you need 200 collections
[02:41] Tobsn: well it wouldnt be massive
[02:41] Tobsn: cause 1,000,000,000 times 1,000,000,000 blocks isnt that big i think
[02:41] techwraith: Yeah, minecraft is 128 high :)
[02:41] techwraith: that's 1 billion meters by 1 billion meters
[02:41] techwraith: almost 500x the size of the earth
[02:41] techwraith: lol
[02:41] Tobsn: yep
[02:42] Tobsn: hmm
[02:42] techwraith: I think that's probably large enough
[02:42] Tobsn: http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Map
[02:43] Tobsn: n Infdev, Alpha and Beta maps are not infinitely big. They are made up of chunks; as the player explores the map distant chunks are generated automatically, leading to theoretically infinite maps. In practice, technical reasons force the maximum map size to 8 times the surface area of the Earth
[02:43] techwraith: Yeah, I've read this one before :) - it's actually a pretty good way of going about it
[02:44] techwraith: The procedural generation is what appeals most to me

[02:56] Tobsn: well only 30% is land
[02:56] techwraith: really?
[02:56] techwraith: hm
[02:56] Tobsn: so you could actually store every meter of land in mongodb :P
[02:56] Tobsn: yep
[02:56] Tobsn: earth is huge
[02:56] Tobsn: haha
[02:57] thegreatape has joined the channel
[02:57] Tobsn: so if you want to save every single square meter on earth you need 3 collections
[02:57] Tobsn: hehe
[02:58] techwraith: It's only 22,585 x 22,585
[02:58] Tobsn: hmm?
[02:58] Tobsn:  510 million square kilometers is the earths surface

[03:00] techwraith: lol
[03:00] Tobsn: yeah thats what i said
[03:00] Tobsn: oh
[03:00] techwraith: http://www.google.com/search?aq=f&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=square+root+of+510%2C072%2C000
[03:00] Tobsn: youre right
[03:00] Tobsn: i did it wrong
[03:00] kaichen has joined the channel
[03:01] techwraith: Basically, we could store quite a few earths in mongo ;)
[03:01] Tobsn: hmm
[03:01] techwraith: about 44k earths to be exact
[03:02] Tobsn: so you could store 44k earth maps next to each other
[03:03] techwraith: or you could make an earth cube by making 22,584 collections and making a 3d geospacial db
[03:03] Tobsn: 6,384,404 meters meters deep
[03:03] Tobsn: so you could store the depth too
[03:03] techwraith: Yep :)
[03:03] Tobsn: no you need only one collection
[03:03] techwraith: Oh, I see what you're saying
[03:04] Tobsn: you just layers next to each other on one map
[03:04] Tobsn: *lay out layers
[03:04] techwraith: it would be difficult to figure out distance from that though
[03:04] ben_alman has joined the channel
[03:04] Tobsn: esp because its a sphere hehe
[03:04] techwraith: e.g. how far is it from the top of everest to the bottom of the ocean
[03:05] Tobsn: on the other side
[03:05] Tobsn: haha
[03:05] techwraith: yeah, exactly
[03:05] Tobsn: i bet there are ways to do that
[03:06] Tobsn: oh yeah
[03:06] Tobsn: easy
[03:06] Tobsn: you know width and height of each map, cause theyare all the same
[03:06] Tobsn: you also know that you start at earth center to the top of the mountains
[03:07] Tobsn: so by x/y coords you know how many lines of layers youre down and how many layers youre to the right
[03:07] Tobsn: you just devide by the width and height
[03:07] Tobsn: and than you have the distance in height
[03:07] techwraith: yeah, that would work I think
[03:07] Tobsn: you could even triangle from that
[03:08] Tobsn: still no use case here hehe
[03:08] techwraith: I think I'm going to stick with a square world, lol
[03:08] Tobsn: oh
[03:08] Tobsn: wait a minute
[03:08] Tobsn: its 22,000 x 22,000 something right?
[03:08] techwraith: yeah
[03:09] Tobsn: 22,000,000,000 would be in milimeters ;)
[03:09] Tobsn: you could index every single millimeter on earth
[03:09] techwraith: lol
[03:09] techwraith: you could
[03:09] Tobsn: see that would be a great GPS
[03:09] techwraith: filling that up with data sounds hellish
[03:09] techwraith: lol
[03:09] Tobsn: problem would be the 3d thing
[03:10] samcday: You people scare me with your crazy talk!
[03:10] Tobsn: you would need 6,000,000,000,000 collections
[03:10] xiackok has joined the channel
[03:11] Tobsn: and that would save every single cubic millimeter
[03:11] techwraith: I think that might be a little past the sharding limit
[03:11] Tobsn: probably...
[03:11] xiackok: hi
[03:11] techwraith: hi there!
[03:11] Tobsn: you could save the depth per object
[03:11] Tobsn: as an int
[03:11] Tobsn: bigint
[03:11] Tobsn: well
[03:11] Tobsn: there ya go
[03:12] Tobsn: but you only have 10 units per cubic millimeter
[03:12] Tobsn: where 0 is air and 1 is water
[03:12] Tobsn: obviously

[03:14] techwraith: xyz axis :)
[03:15] Tobsn: nah you need
[03:15] Tobsn: 50,50 and also depth
[03:15] Tobsn: and from depth you read the position of the bigint
[03:15] Tobsn: tostring and than [$depth]
[03:15] Tobsn: ;)
[03:16] techwraith: Yeah, that would work, but it would be faster if the db handled everythin

[03:19] mscdex: heh
[03:19] mscdex: ACTION shakes a fist at the metric system
[03:20] Tobsn: so 6000 meter deep is 6,000,000 milimeters
[03:20] Tobsn: thats so you could give every depth milimeter 2 digits in a bigint
[03:21] Tobsn: means 00 to 99
[03:21] techwraith: So this is a bit of an issue:

[03:23] Tobsn: well
[03:23] Tobsn: 1844674459709551600
[03:23] Tobsn: is also enough
[03:23] Tobsn: you have to take away the one and the last two numbers anyway
[03:24] Tobsn: oh no
[03:24] Tobsn: youre right

[04:06] gmarcus: ncb000gt: wow...NodeScript worked.  thanks!
[04:06] Tobsn: query, params, callback
[04:06] ncb000gt: gmarcus: cool :)
[04:06] Tobsn: in the examples there is one that only has the callback
[04:06] Tobsn: but the callback also only has "err" and not "fields" and other stuff you have in there.. i guess it wouldnt matter but who knows...
[04:07] ncb000gt: Tobsn: in the code it checks to see if params is there, if it is then it uses it, if it's not an array then it sets cb, the callback, to be whatever the second argument was
[04:07] Tobsn: yeah i assumed that
[04:07] ncb000gt: so i doubt that'll be it unless there is bug in that code
[04:07] ncb000gt: however, it might fix the problem
[04:07] ncb000gt: ;D
[04:07] Tobsn: see!
[04:07] Tobsn: ;)
[04:07] ncb000gt: but hide something else
[04:07] phluffy: no change :(
[04:07] Tobsn: always go strict first
[04:07] ncb000gt: heh
[04:07] Tobsn: no change?
[04:07] Tobsn: copy that error
[04:08] ncb000gt: Tobsn: boo hiss... just jump to conclusions, more fun that way!
[04:08] Tobsn: hehe
[04:08] phluffy: no, i still get 'Illegal instruction' - that's all I get
[04:08] Tobsn: hmm
[04:08] Tobsn: remove all the other stuff
[04:08] Tobsn: and do only query( 'SELECT * FROM data' )
[04:08] pkrumins: can't wait for jsbbq
[04:08] Tobsn: erm
[04:08] Tobsn: FROM test
[04:08] phluffy: yeah - tried that too and got the same
[04:09] Tobsn: do the same in the command line
[04:09] Tobsn: on mysql client
[04:09] Tobsn: and see what that thing says
[04:09] ncb000gt: yea
[04:09] ncb000gt: was just about to say the same
[04:09] phluffy: it gives me the table
[04:09] Tobsn: hmm
[04:09] Tobsn: same user?
[04:09] ncb000gt: pkrumins: where at?
[04:09] phluffy: well - select * from test... data is a col
[04:10] Tobsn: same user as in the script?
[04:10] phluffy: in the mysql cli
[04:10] phluffy: yes
[04:10] Tobsn: sure?
[04:10] ncb000gt: I doubt the example would have the real l/p
[04:10] phluffy: yes - positive
[04:10] Tobsn: well
[04:10] ncb000gt: probably his user
[04:10] Tobsn: go into the module and start debugging ;)
[04:10] ncb000gt: haha
[04:10] matschaffer has joined the channel
[04:11] Tobsn: just put some console.logs into the query function
[04:11] Tobsn: and see what happens
[04:11] phluffy: maybe there is an easier to use module for basic mysql?
[04:11] Tobsn: well
[04:11] ncb000gt: phluffy: what version of mysql are you using?
[04:11] Tobsn: that is basic mysql
[04:13] Tobsn: 5.0 something i bet

[04:23] Croms: one sec, let me check something real quick
[04:23] pkrumins: i wonder why nodejs website says 0.4.5
[04:23] pkrumins: near docs
[04:23] Tobsn: https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/url.js
[04:23] ncb000gt: pkrumins: 0.4.5 was released
[04:23] ncb000gt: :)
[04:24] ncb000gt: pkrumins: http://blog.nodejs.org/2011/04/02/node-v0-4-5/
[04:24] Tobsn: croms, only way that fails is if you have something in it that doesnt fit the regex in the source
[04:24] ckknight has joined the channel
[04:24] Tobsn: protocolPattern = /^([a-z0-9]+:)/
[04:24] pkrumins: awesome
[04:24] pkrumins: we're still at 0.4.0
[04:24] ckknight: hey beautiful people
[04:25] Croms: I'm probably doing something wrong
[04:25] ncb000gt: Croms: strange
[04:25] ncb000gt: it works for me
[04:25] ncb000gt: on 0.4.3
[04:25] ncb000gt: are you sure that request.url is defined?
[04:25] Tobsn: yeah you might cant access it ith .protocol
[04:25] ncb000gt: console.log it just before that line
[04:25] Croms: What do you get when you guys do console.log(request.url);?
[04:25] Croms: I just get "
[04:25] Croms: "/"
[04:26] ncb000gt: Croms: are you using something like express?
[04:26] Croms: No, just plain vanilla Node.
[04:26] ncb000gt: ok
[04:27] Croms: url.parse(request.url).pathname works fine
[04:27] Tobsn: erm
[04:27] Tobsn: which module is that
[04:27] Gotham: Default
[04:27] Croms: No modules, just regular Node.
[04:27] Tobsn: hmm i thought so too
[04:27] Tobsn: ah nevermind
[04:27] Tobsn: im doing it in the shell
[04:27] Tobsn: *dah
[04:28] ncb000gt: Croms: i get the same for request.url
[04:28] Croms: I remember someone had the same thing a few weeks ago.
[04:28] Tobsn: request.uri?
[04:29] Tobsn: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.3.1/api/http.html#http.ServerRequest
[04:29] Tobsn: yep
[04:29] Tobsn: url is only path
[04:31] bluekite2000_ has joined the channel
[04:31] Tobsn: well request is the request
[04:31] ncb000gt: Croms: why do you need the full piece?

[04:31] ashc has joined the channel
[04:31] Croms: ncb000gt: Need to do some forwarding.
[04:31] Tobsn: i guess request is coming from the request header... "host:" is in the header...
[04:32] ncb000gt: Tobsn: but that doesn't provide the proto
[04:32] Tobsn: well
[04:32] Tobsn: nope
[04:32] Tobsn: as i said, its only the request
[04:32] Tobsn: but where else would it be...

[05:04] markc: is there anyway to prevent node from sending headers? even if I do not use writeHead() I still get Connection: and Transfer-Encoding: headers
[05:04] rfay has joined the channel
[05:05] ncb000gt: markc: why do you not want to send headers?
[05:05] ncb000gt: markc: the answer is no, but i'm curious about why
[05:06] markc: ncb000gt: I'm calling a cgi script and I'd rather it return all the headers
[05:06] ncb000gt: markc: you mean just proxy them through?
[05:07] markc: ncb000gt: yes, more to the point, I can't figure out how to prevent php-cgi -q from sending headers
[05:07] ncb000gt: no idea for php-cgi
[05:07] markc: so 100% no way to disable all headers in node?
[05:08] ncb000gt: markc: not with the http module
[05:09] markc: ncb000gt: right, so feel free to write my own replacement then :)
[05:09] ncb000gt: haha
[05:09] ncb000gt: you could either do that or just pass the headers through from the cgi script
[05:09] ncb000gt: erm, cgi request
[05:10] matt_ has joined the channel
[05:10] markc: ncb000gt: but node sends a \r\n\r\n before the cgi script sends it's data which then includes it's headers as well
[05:10] vnguyen has joined the channel
[05:11] ncb000gt: markc: then it sounds like your callbacks are screwed up, can you put some code in a gist

[05:19] kmiyashiro: does anyone know which markdown processor github uses?
[05:20] kmiyashiro: is it just a port of the perl?
[05:20] ncb000gt: kmiyashiro: https://github.com/github/github-flavored-markdown
[05:20] kmiyashiro: yeah
[05:20] markc: ncb000gt: https://gist.github.com/899249  is the basic function
[05:20] kmiyashiro: I know about their customizations
[05:21] kmiyashiro: but what about the basic implementation?
[05:21] kmiyashiro: is it still regex hell?
[05:21] kmiyashiro: and is there any other way other than regex magic?
[05:24] ncb000gt: markc: yea, you're not proxying the headers through before you call write
[05:24] ncb000gt: although, in that case, you're not making an http request so there are no headers to pass through
[05:25] jetienne: uploading node 0.4.5 deb
[05:25] markc: ncb000gt: can you give me hint how in the context of that function?

[05:26] ncb000gt: markc: https://gist.github.com/899254
[05:27] dgathright has joined the channel
[05:27] ncb000gt: so adding the writeHead function will let you push headers to the client
[05:28] markc: ncb000gt: but the headers coming from a PHP script are included with the function (data) as part of the body of the returned data

[05:29] noocx: which is a good choice for templating?
[05:29] ncb000gt: noocx: what are you looking for?
[05:29] noocx: template engine
[05:29] noocx: like ejs, jade, etc
[05:30] ncb000gt: noocx: right, i mean, what kind of templating do you prefer?
[05:30] ncb000gt: do you prefer to write it all in js
[05:30] noocx: like ejs
[05:30] ncb000gt: more like the django style
[05:30] noocx: but if there's better i use that
[05:30] ncb000gt: ok, so then i'd say to use that
[05:30] ncb000gt: meh, do what you prefer
[05:30] markc: ncb000gt: I think the only thing I can do is regex out the incoming cgi (php) headers from the returned data and manually add a writeHead
[05:30] ncb000gt: they're all about the same
[05:31] sor3nsen: mustache for templating!
[05:31] ncb000gt: markc: will they always be at the front of the response?
[05:31] noocx: is there a big difference in performance?
[05:31] ncb000gt: noocx: not from what i've seen
[05:31] noocx: ok thanks
[05:31] meso__ has joined the channel
[05:31] markc: ncb000gt: yes, a typical headers up until 2 blank lines
[05:31] ncb000gt: i remembered hearing something about weld having some performance issues, but i thought that the nodejistu guys had hammered through that
[05:32] ncb000gt: markc: ok, then use that, create your headers object and then write that from the data

[05:40] Tobsn: oh right
[05:40] Tobsn: that makes it 246
[05:40] ncb000gt: lol
[05:41] Tobsn: funny fact, i dont use a single one
[05:42] ncb000gt: markc: https://gist.github.com/899254
[05:42] ncb000gt: that will get you up to checking the headers
[05:42] ncb000gt: removes the whole "stream the data through stuff"
[05:43] ncb000gt: side of things
[05:43] ncb000gt: but it's at least a start
[05:43] markc: ncb000gt: awesome, thank you and that'll keep me out of mischief for awhile
[05:43] ncb000gt: oh, you'll also need to increment the offset
[05:43] ncb000gt: forgot that

[05:50] tylerstalder has joined the channel
[05:52] ljackson: how much data in an object say using it as a hash (assoc array) do you start running into blocking e.g. for(var prop in obj) { do some very short thing}
[05:52] ljackson: or is there a better node.js way
[05:53] ncb000gt: ljackson: you'll have blocking regardless of the amount of data you have. i think you might be asking at which point does it become relevant?
[05:53] ncb000gt: ljackson: and that is dependent
[05:53] ljackson: yeah more to the point
[05:54] Tobsn: it depends on what you do inside the for ;)
[05:55] ljackson: humm... so just profile as you go eh? where would you store state of a hashmap outside of node in some other datastore ?
[05:55] ljackson: if you really wanted to scale such operations
[05:55] Tobsn: depends on how large and why
[05:55] Tobsn: memcache or directly in shared mem i would assume
[05:56] ljackson: think 100s or 1000s of xmmp clients keeping track of their roster in a map object so the browser based client doesn't or at least not initially
[05:56] Tobsn: roster?
[05:56] ljackson: buddy list
[05:56] Tobsn: hmm
[05:56] seivan has joined the channel
[05:56] ljackson: most users ~ 20 or 30 people in their list 
[05:56] Tobsn: why wouldnt the client keep the buddylist
[05:57] Tobsn: always assume the worst
[05:57] ljackson: yeah but over socket.io they may come and go...etc.
[05:57] Tobsn: 200,000 people with 100 people each
[05:57] harth has joined the channel
[05:57] ljackson: yeah 
[05:57] Tobsn: yeah but they load it once and keep it until they disconnect
[05:57] ljackson: thats why I am asking now before I get to deep in my arch with node.js in memory
[05:57] ncb000gt: assuming the worst is a bad idea
[05:57] ncb000gt: leads to architecting for the moon
[05:57] Tobsn: well the worst is like 10 millione at one with 200 people each
[05:58] Tobsn: -e
[05:58] Tobsn: *once
[05:58] Tobsn: damn keyboard
[05:58] ljackson: ncb000gt, not going to build the rocket version now just want to know what to think about when I need to
[05:58] ncb000gt: i'd say to look at something like redis for now, it's KV, but it's all in memory
[05:58] ljackson: ya
[05:59] ljackson: was thinking voltdb or some other in memory db so you could select the roster and update into it...etc.
[05:59] ncb000gt: if you're looking to scale horizontally then you'll likely want something else
[05:59] Tobsn: i wouldnt use a db
[05:59] timmywil has joined the channel
[05:59] ncb000gt: i know very little about volt
[05:59] ljackson: any way to have node.js call java ? lol
[06:00] Tobsn: look into shared mem
[06:00] ncb000gt: Tobsn: why not use a db?
[06:00] Tobsn: for what?
[06:00] stalled has joined the channel
[06:00] ljackson: voltdb is shared mem with horizontall scal
[06:00] ljackson: er scale
[06:00] dguttman has joined the channel
[06:00] Tobsn: for a single array?
[06:00] ljackson: all in memory
[06:00] Tobsn: which is rarely altered
[06:00] Tobsn: i mean its in DB already
[06:00] Tobsn: i assume
[06:00] ljackson: all presence updates will alter it
[06:00] Tobsn: to temp. store it just shuff it up your rams ass
[06:00] Tobsn: ;)
[06:00] ljackson: so it isn't all that rare
[06:01] FireFly|n900 has joined the channel
[06:01] Tobsn: well
[06:01] Tobsn: still
[06:01] Tobsn: at least try it out
[06:01] Tobsn: if you store it in a db
[06:02] Tobsn: hmm
[06:02] Tobsn: yeah if you store it in any db, you still need to
[06:02] Tobsn: nah doesnt really apply
[06:02] Tobsn: mongodb saves everything in ram
[06:02] Tobsn: i think redis uses fam too
[06:03] Croms has joined the channel
[06:03] Tobsn: i would still try ram first
[06:03] Tobsn: just to see if it works and how fast it is
[06:03] ljackson: still doesn't offload the interation/updates to some other process so it would still block node
[06:03] ljackson: that is my quandry
[06:04] Tobsn: https://github.com/dazhazit/node-ipcbuffer
[06:04] Tobsn: im not sure if that would block
[06:04] Tobsn: if you put it in a callback
[06:04] ljackson: ok 
[06:04] Tobsn: an update function which fires back the result to the client
[06:04] Tobsn: when its done
[06:04] ErikCorry has joined the channel
[06:04] ljackson: thats cool
[06:05] Tobsn: just build a listener for update events
[06:05] Tobsn: which knows the client id
[06:06] JianMeng has joined the channel
[06:07] ljackson: Tobsn, thanks for the ideas
[06:07] Tobsn: i got one more
[06:07] Tobsn: once sec
[06:07] ljackson: i will think about it, ok
[06:07] Tobsn: *one
[06:08] ljackson: on a side note loving node.js and it's eventing model

[06:10] jimt has joined the channel
[06:10] Tobsn: http://schumann.cx/ircg/
[06:10] Tobsn: look into that
[06:12] ljackson: yeah cool stuff, I am already covered with socket.io for that it works very well and uses websockets,flashsocket or xhr-multipart in a downgrade fastion to handle crazy ammounts of events from node
[06:12] ljackson: my only scaling worrie is the roster object per client
[06:12] Tobsn: i know
[06:12] Tobsn: has nothing to do with ircg
[06:12] Tobsn: erm irc
[06:12] Tobsn: its about how he handles thousands of connections at the same time
[06:12] ljackson: thats why I am using node.js and socket.io :)
[06:13] ljackson: otherwise I wouldn't be here
[06:13] ljackson: hehe
[06:13] Tobsn: yeah you dont get the hint
[06:13] Tobsn: anyway, try to use mem, if not memcache, if not redis, if not mongodb
[06:13] ljackson: ok good pointers

[07:05] beginner: Hi guys and node gurus.... a quick question ... we generally start a node.js script from shell using node script_name.js ..... but there might be a issue / error / end of events ... how would one ensure the script runs again in the event of error ?
[07:07] jesusabdullah: you're looking for, umm
[07:07] jesusabdullah: shit, what's the word
[07:07] jesusabdullah: process manager?
[07:08] jesusabdullah: You could use monit or upstart or something like that
[07:08] jesusabdullah: There are also a few node projects that do the same
[07:08] jesusabdullah: or similar, rather
[07:08] dekz: err what's the way to throw configure arguments to node-waf configure
[07:08] jesusabdullah: only one I can think of off the top of my head is indexzero's "forever.js"
[07:08] jesusabdullah: I made a crappy one too, but it might do what you need
[07:08] jesusabdullah: Both on github
[07:09] jesusabdullah: Oh, and
[07:09] jesusabdullah: while :; do ./proggy.js; done

[07:19] GriffenJBS: the while do done look is the same, as is the node solutions, unless something starts killing processes your ok

[08:22] Aikar: beginner: theres not any real known instability issues with node atm i dont think. so if you write good code it shouldnt be a problem :P
[08:23] Aikar: you can also write a startup script that checks if its already running and abort, then run it as a cronjob every 1m
[08:23] Aikar: or put it in a bash shell script that does while (true)
[08:23] Aikar: numerous ways to ensure code stays running
[08:24] seivan: So
[08:24] seivan: The nodeguide, any way to have deployment strategies going
[08:24] seivan: especially load balancers with direct socket connections
[08:24] seivan: :D
[08:24] seivan: and the OOP guide would be nice as well
[08:24] Aikar: im confused, deployment and LB/direct sockets, how do they relate?
[08:24] Aikar: deploying code is 1 step
[08:24] Aikar: running it is another
[08:25] Aikar: and theres plenty of OOP JS strategies
[08:25] Aikar: they all work for node
[08:26] Aikar: foo.js: module.exports = function foo(){/* constructor*/}; foo.prototype = {method:function(){}};
[08:26] stagas has joined the channel
[08:27] Aikar: then var Foo = require('./foo'); var oFoo = new Foo();
[08:27] claudiu__ has joined the channel

[08:29] Aikar: array.map
[08:29] jesusabdullah: No, a FILTER
[08:29] Aikar: can be used to filter :P
[08:29] jesusabdullah: oh? How so? :S
[08:30] jesusabdullah: Maybe I've just used underscore's filter in the past
[08:32] jesusabdullah: Son of a bitch, THERE's filter
[08:32] jesusabdullah: I KNEW it
[08:32] Aikar: yeah .filter exists
[08:32] jesusabdullah: wtf was I doing wrong??
[08:32] Aikar: i thought you could do it with map
[08:33] steffkes has joined the channel
[08:33] jesusabdullah: Maybe

[08:37] jesusabdullah: well
[08:37] jesusabdullah: all I want is the array

[09:07] jesusabdullah: There you go.
[09:08] astropirate: jesusabdullah,  thats what i wanted :D thanks
[09:08] Aikar: "verbose" is optional in vows
[09:08] Aikar: you can turn it on if you want it
[09:08] Aikar: or use default dotmatrix

[09:08] jesusabdullah: I meant the interface

[09:09] shaunau: someone just asked on the mail list if there was something like DotNetOpenAuth for node, that does all the diff types of authentication, google, facebook, twitter, etc. sounds like a very handy thing to have. Anyone know of such a beast for node?

[09:15] V1: yup
[09:17] synkro: hi
[09:17] synkro: I can't update my node to 0.4.5 with npm.
[09:17] synkro: is that normal behaviiour?
[09:17] V1: NPM cant update node.
[09:17] Aikar: well, it technically could ;)
[09:18] Aikar: after node was installed the first time that is
[09:18] V1: Aikar: even if npm is running on the same node process that needs to get updated ;)?
[09:18] synkro: oh okay, thank you
[09:18] Aikar: V1: yep
[09:18] V1: fork/patch/commit/pull ;O
[09:18] Aikar: you can update a binary while its in use, it just doesnt take effect until process is restarted
[09:18] shaunau: ryah: i could automate all my builds if the node-latest.tar.gz was automatically sym-linked to the new build, having said that, now that i know which day it's released & i know which version will be next i can just check for it on Saturdays :)
[09:18] Aikar: npm can download tar/gz, recompile and install
[09:19] V1: Aikar: than, technically, it would be possible to create a "node" package that install's nodejs
[09:19] Aikar: and optionally do that step on the npm .sh install
[09:20] shaunau: V1:Aikar would be handy. then it could also update all the libs too.

[11:12] saebekassebil: Experiencing some wierd problems with installing 'forever' module
[11:12] saebekassebil: http://pastebin.com/P9tsR0eX
[11:13] saebekassebil: Saying that node version: '*' is required, but i have 'v0.4.2'
[11:13] saebekassebil: Which should be ok?
[11:13] kronos has joined the channel
[11:17] jetienne: replace * by '>= 0.0.0'
[11:18] jetienne: saebekassebil: or do "nmod install forever'
[11:18] johnnywengluu: hm
[11:18] johnnywengluu: what is nmod
[11:18] saebekassebil: how would i replace it when it isn't my module?
[11:19] jetienne: https://github.com/jeromeetienne/nmod nmod is a node_module manager
[11:20] Charuru has joined the channel
[11:20] jetienne: saebekassebil: if you cant, you can use nmod. i just tested it is installable
[11:21] saebekassebil: so your nmod module, install a module locally, what's the difference from npm?
[11:21] jetienne: saebekassebil: not the same code. it is compatible tho
[11:22] jetienne: and it focus on install, nothing on publishing
[11:22] jetienne: publishing may be done on git repo or by npm
[11:23] jetienne: oh and yeah the key thing for me is "installed locally"
[11:23] jetienne: all is installed in the ./node_modules directory. nothing below current directory. no system install
[11:23] jetienne: i find it easier to deploy and understand when it remains local
[11:23] Bonuspunkt has joined the channel
[11:23] jetienne: i will write that in a blog post one day :)
[11:24] johnnywengluu: why nmod and not npm?
[11:25] jetienne: johnnywengluu: ? can you rephrase i dont understand the question
[11:26] johnnywengluu: why would i want to use nmod and not npm?
[11:26] johnnywengluu: npm link
[11:26] jetienne: johnnywengluu: i dunno... only you knows what you want
[11:26] jetienne: just another alternative
[11:26] johnnywengluu: but why would someone want to use nmod
[11:27] johnnywengluu: there has to be a purpose for its existence right =)
[11:28] jetienne: johnnywengluu: i told you why i use it :) i like the 'small install', the 'only node_modules', the 'all is local'
[11:28] jetienne: the simplicity makes it easier to understand for me
[11:29] jetienne: johnnywengluu: if those features are cool for you, maybe nmod is cool for you
[11:29] johnnywengluu: =)
[11:29] johnnywengluu: what do you mean by small install
[11:29] johnnywengluu: node_modules
[11:29] johnnywengluu: and all is local
[11:29] jetienne: arf no time to explain more sorry
[11:30] johnnywengluu: ok
[11:30] jetienne: johnnywengluu: i only started to unblock the foreever install

[15:46] dve has joined the channel
[15:46] mscdex: :P
[15:46] mscdex: to 'util'
[15:47] rohit_nsit08: actually i was trying to understand the codebase of a javascript compiler which is using node , there is a line , " var sys =  require("sys") 
[15:47] mscdex: yeah?
[15:48] gtramont1na: ckknight, It is a bit hard to give you a better advice. But given the assync nature of node, a callback would be the best choice.
[15:48] trotter has joined the channel
[15:48] rohit_nsit08: which i traced and found that it is loading core "sys" module which is bundled with node
[15:48] bluekite2000_ has joined the channel
[15:48] mscdex: yep
[15:48] rohit_nsit08: what is the use of "sys" or "util" module

[15:51] rohit_nsit08: mscdex: thanks , got it . it's for the debugging purpose :-)
[15:51] mscdex: ckknight: imo, i'd avoid attaching it to req in case the "params" property is used in the future by core
[15:52] ckknight: mscdex: well, I know connect.router attaches it to req, and my lib is meant to be a replacement for it (not to be used alongside, unless separately mounted)
[15:52] mscdex: oh
[15:54] rohit_nsit08: mscdex: is there any old documentation where information about "sys" can be found, i can't see, util.puts() function in current doc
[15:54] rohit_nsit08: mscdex: was there any sys.puts() earlier?
[15:56] mscdex: rohit_nsit08: in 0.2.x
[15:56] mscdex: but it's the same module

[16:34] johnnywengluu: so im in deep nesting problem
[16:34] johnnywengluu: could someone tell me how to refactor this so i dont have to nest forever
[16:34] johnnywengluu: https://gist.github.com/899623
[16:35] micheil: johnnywengluu: chain and use named functions instead of anonymous functions?
[16:35] johnnywengluu: on lines: 11, 41 and 62 i have callbacks .. but i can't split them out because the first one is dependent of a variable inside the main function
[16:35] micheil: so, move runAction out of the forEach function, and then do: forEach(runAction);
[16:35] mikl has joined the channel
[16:35] jeromegn: johnnywengluu: I'd say: try out a neat async flow control library: https://github.com/caolan/async
[16:36] timmywil has joined the channel
[16:37] johnnywengluu: jeromegn:maybe i should
[16:37] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[16:37] micheil: johnnywengluu: first try separating your functions out
[16:37] jeromegn: johnnywengluu: micheil's solution would work too
[16:37] johnnywengluu: micheil: yeah i did that .. but the functions are dependent on variables inside another function
[16:37] micheil: johnnywengluu: or re-think what you're actually doing.
[16:37] stagas: johnnywengluu: populate an object on the first callback since you've got an index and grab the variables from there
[16:37] micheil: johnnywengluu: in which case a chaining library will not help you
[16:38] johnnywengluu: so the function on line 11 is depending on the "app" variable on line 4
[16:38] alessio_alexAFK has joined the channel
[16:39] stagas: johnnywengluu: now you're just wasting memory assinging local variables all the time
[16:39] alek_br has joined the channel

[16:39] johnnywengluu: =)
[16:40] johnnywengluu: micheil: sorry i cant get you
[16:40] johnnywengluu: cant you just edit quickly on with the first callback on line 11 as an example .. cant understand
[16:40] johnnywengluu: if you dont have time dont bother =)
[16:41] micheil: johnnywengluu: well, if you can't separate your functions out, then you can't use a chaining library which requires you to separate your functions out.
[16:41] johnnywengluu: yeah
[16:41] johnnywengluu: so what was your solution?
[16:41] micheil: rethink the way you're doing things
[16:41] johnnywengluu: i dont know how to think
[16:42] johnnywengluu: its pretty simple stuff im doing .. do one thing .. do another .. etc
[16:42] johnnywengluu: kinda leads to this design all the time
[16:42] micheil: then you have a bigger problem then nested callbacks
[16:42] johnnywengluu: what are the problems here?
[16:42] johnnywengluu: nested callbacks are one of them .. i dont even know how to solve it 
[16:43] micheil: well, if you don't know your problem and can't think of solutions, then those are your problems
[16:43] Bogh has joined the channel
[16:43] johnnywengluu: someone with experience give me some hints
[16:43] micheil: the first problem in solving a problem is knowing your problem
[16:43] micheil: your problem isn't nested callbacks.
[16:43] johnnywengluu: do you know my problem?
[16:44] johnnywengluu: or the problem with this kind of coding
[16:44] micheil: not overly, because I don't know what you want to achieve.
[16:44] micheil: but I'll give you one thing, that code is really weird with all that variable assignment
[16:44] saschagehlich has joined the channel
[16:44] SubStack: instead of foo(function () { bar(function () {}) }), you can do foo(f); function f () { bar(g) }) function g () {}

[16:50] micheil: .. the problem isn't the closures, it's the approach.
[16:50] johnnywengluu: micheil: what about variable assignments?
[16:51] micheil: well, you don't need to be doing that many variable assignments.

[16:54] johnnywengluu: with API documentation, tests, issue tracker .. good way learning how to integrate everything
[16:54] bolvarak: leave lots of comments and incorporate some indentation standards and you'll be fine
[16:54] johnnywengluu: =)
[16:54] johnnywengluu: how do you generate online docs with markdown?
[16:54] bolvarak: and always remember KISS
[16:55] johnnywengluu: yeah my DSL is really simple
[16:55] AntelopeSalad: is this the 100% standard way to use mustache with express? http://bitdrift.com/post/2376383378/using-mustache-templates-in-express

[16:56] micheil: johnnywengluu: perhaps rather than using an object or array to store your routes you have a method that creates them
[16:57] johnnywengluu: its part of the DSL
[16:57] micheil: var myapp = mylibrary(app);
[16:57] micheil: myapp.route(...)
[16:57] micheil: even though you don't really need a layer on top of express for routing.
[16:57] micheil: you just need something for loading files.
[16:58] johnnywengluu: micheil: yeah its part of the DSL
[16:58] johnnywengluu: making a workflow framework for automating stuff on the backend
[16:58] micheil: johnnywengluu: seriously, DSL's are overrated.
[16:58] johnnywengluu: "DSL" .. using pure js  .. i shouldn't call it DSL
[16:58] johnnywengluu: its a framework =)
[16:59] johnnywengluu: well .. lets see of the outcome 
[16:59] johnnywengluu: since there are no good "script" automation frameworks for the backend
[17:00] perlmonkey2: There wouldn't happen to be a nice fully baked widely used CMS for node is there?
[17:00] SleH: Is there any particular reason why you shou?
[17:00] SleH: Is there any particular reason why you should/shouldn't run node js without a reverse proxy*?
[17:01] johnnywengluu: really .. there has never been one around .. only frameworks for css, js, ruby etc for automating stuff for creating web apps .. but a lot of coders tend to do things manually
[17:01] johnnywengluu: or using some scripts to automate some tasks .. i want every task i do twice to be automated
[17:01] gazumps has joined the channel
[17:02] onr: SleH: no
[17:02] johnnywengluu: there should be a solid framework for getting rid of these ridiculous manual tasks once and for all .. so tired of searching and never finds one no matter platform
[17:03] SleH: So it's fine to have a nodejs webapp publicly facing?
[17:03] onr: SleH: ofcourse
[17:03] Bonuspunkt: it is already?
[17:04] SleH: Alright, just checking - people suggested putting it behind nginx, but I can't do that sadly, kills websockets.
[17:04] johnnywengluu: so this would be kinda new gen framework .. a framework to automate for the coders, so the coders can automate for the users
[17:05] astoon has joined the channel
[17:06] postwait has joined the channel
[17:06] onr: SleH: although i dont give heck to websockets and im an nginx community volunteer, im going to use pure node.js in my startup
[17:06] micheil: perlmonkey2: for a CMS, do you _need_ to use node?
[17:07] SubStack: johnnywengluu: there are good kinds of automation and bad kinds
[17:07] SubStack: good kinds let you describe the problem in an abstract, high-level way
[17:07] SubStack: bad kinds use code generation and leave you stuck with crappy scaffolding after the interfaces change
[17:07] harth has joined the channel
[17:08] micheil: onr: node.js is pretty safe to run bare on the wire (ie, not fronted with a reverse proxy)
[17:08] SleH: Alright good to knwo
[17:08] SleH: know*
[17:08] ralphholzmann_ has joined the channel
[17:09] johnnywengluu: SubStack: you mean abstraction

[17:12] johnnywengluu: my framework is not for automating actions for you .. you create these actions (functions) yourself .. then you can put them inside workflows that you can trigger .. if one action fails it calls the undo actions that you have defined so everything will be reverted .. and some more features
[17:13] shaunau: with regard to running node http "naked", what about all the good stuff web servers bring for free, load balancing, url rewriting, max connection limits so not to kill your server, htaccess style security, cacheing etc. I'd rather have this stuff from a battle tested web server used by 1000s of sites that build all that into my app. That way i can concentrate on delivering my business logic rather than all the scaffolding.
[17:13] jimt_ has joined the channel
[17:13] johnnywengluu: so its up to you if you inside your action write code to generate code
[17:13] mscdex: shaunau: there are node modules that bring a lot of that stuff
[17:14] xandrews has joined the channel
[17:14] shaunau: mscdex: yeah i guess

[17:17] johnnywengluu: i want to get rid of these kind of problems
[17:18] jimt has joined the channel
[17:18] johnnywengluu: or if i read how to use ssh to generate keygen .. i dont want to rely on memory .. i want to write them down in an action then i have it there and can just use it in a workflow

[17:19] gtramont1na: Hey all. What is the most common node project structure? 
[17:20] johnnywengluu: gtramont1na: npm =)
[17:20] johnnywengluu: package.json, lib/ , bin/ 
[17:20] johnnywengluu: README
[17:20] johnnywengluu: LICENSE
[17:20] johnnywengluu: look around popular modules
[17:21] gtramont1na: Where do you keep your tests? along with bin?
[17:21] johnnywengluu: tests/
[17:21] gtramont1na: right.
[17:21] johnnywengluu: it has to be a npm package
[17:21] johnnywengluu: or it isn't a node module
[17:21] jakehow has joined the channel
[17:21] johnnywengluu: =)
[17:22] gtramont1na: Yeah, thats what I've been doing. Just wanted to check with the community what is the most common structure.
[17:22] gtramont1na: Thanks a lot!
[17:23] syn|code has joined the channel
[17:23] gtramont1na: so inside lib/ do you keep your dependencies?
[17:23] gtramont1na: Or this is your project itself.
[17:24] gtramont1na: When using npm to manage my dependencies it, by default, puts all libs inside node_modules/
[17:24] marcosvm has joined the channel
[17:25] johnnywengluu: i think you should put all your project files inside lib/
[17:25] gtramont1na: what goes inside bin/ then?
[17:25] johnnywengluu: set the "lib" property in package.json to point to your lib file
[17:25] johnnywengluu: the file you want to be able to run on command line
[17:25] SubStack: false
[17:25] johnnywengluu: no?
[17:25] ckknight: anyone have any ideas why expresso --coverage doesn't seem to actually give a coverage report?
[17:25] SubStack: johnnywengluu: that's bin
[17:26] johnnywengluu: thats what i said
[17:26] SubStack: oh I read it with gtramont1na's question
[17:26] SubStack: carry on
[17:27] johnnywengluu: you specify the bin file location /bin/<projectname> in your package.json
[17:27] SubStack: jscheel: well paste the code, how about?
[17:27] Lagnus has joined the channel
[17:28] gtramont1na: So bin/ would only have a single .js (or .coffee or whatever) which is the entry point of the app?
[17:28] johnnywengluu: gtramont1na: look at some packages like http-console, npm, underscore, express
[17:28] johnnywengluu: look at their package.json
[17:28] johnnywengluu: and their structure
[17:28] johnnywengluu: and you'll get it pretty fast
[17:28] Yuffster has joined the channel
[17:28] gtramont1na: I've been looking at some of them, but I noticed the lack of tests in some of them.
[17:28] Blazento has joined the channel
[17:28] johnnywengluu: gtramont1na: yeah from the command line
[17:29] micheil: V1: ping
[17:29] SubStack: gtramont1na: There is nothing special about the directory names. They are conventions
[17:29] V1: micheil: Pong
[17:29] gtramont1na: Correct. These conventions that I want to gather...
[17:29] johnnywengluu: and in the lib/ there is the entry point for your module when people do require("lib_name") to get your lib
[17:29] johnnywengluu: conventions are good to know
[17:30] johnnywengluu: so we talk the same language
[17:30] gtramont1na: Exactly! :-)
[17:30] johnnywengluu: some do index.js in root to be the "lib" entry point from package.json
[17:30] jscheel: SubStack: here's the basics: http://pastie.org/1747913
[17:30] johnnywengluu: others lib/package_name.js
[17:30] jscheel: (well, the relevant parts)
[17:31] SubStack: I try not to have my packages grow big enough to need a lib/
[17:31] SubStack: just an index.js
[17:31] gtramont1na: So here we've been talking about creating a module/lib so someone can use it. But how about a webapp?
[17:31] johnnywengluu: okay
[17:31] johnnywengluu: gtramont1na: then you don't need a lib/ entry point
[17:31] johnnywengluu: or you could
[17:32] johnnywengluu: if its a web app others should use in their code
[17:32] stagas has joined the channel
[17:32] jscheel: SubStack: oops, ignore the incorrect form url in that pastie , it's already fixed
[17:32] johnnywengluu: or if its a web app you trigger from the command line .. then its bin/
[17:33] johnnywengluu: or you just have an app.js in your root .. and run it with node app.js
[17:33] Horofox: any1 have an idea of how much it would cost me to have ~200 concurrent users, using socket.io and stuff?
[17:33] jscheel: SubStack: the error is thrown before the route callback is fired
[17:33] jimt has joined the channel
[17:33] shiawuen has joined the channel
[17:33] johnnywengluu: its  pretty simple with express

[17:34] gtramont1na: Hum. I didn't know about this express command line! Thanks for the tip! I was using it manually. I'll give it a try!
[17:34] Horofox: V1: ok ty
[17:34] johnnywengluu: gtramont1na: express is very good framework that doesn't hide node.js

[17:36] hasenj has joined the channel
[17:36] itistoday has joined the channel

[17:36] itistoday: where does npm install stuff to on OS X?
[17:36] johnnywengluu: just email him 
[17:36] johnnywengluu: he is always around here too
[17:36] gtramont1na: johnnywengluu: var fn = function() {} is different from function fn();
[17:37] AntelopeSalad: it's probably something basic (new to node), but there needs to be way more hand holding going on to get newbies myself going
[17:37] AntelopeSalad: *like myself
[17:37] johnnywengluu: yeah i know the diff is between parsing and run time
[17:37] johnnywengluu: should i care?
[17:37] ncb000gt has joined the channel
[17:37] johnnywengluu: it sounds like declaring it in parse time is better if it doesn't change
[17:38] johnnywengluu: and i save memory dont i?
[17:38] jscheel: AntelopeSalad: not sure if moustache and express work together, but the express documentation is pretty clear on registering a different templating engine
[17:39] AntelopeSalad: his documentation for template engines includes nothing but a link to the templates
[17:39] galaxywatcher has joined the channel
[17:39] gtramont1na: I'm not sure about the memory saving. When I'm writing an API, I declare all functions as variables and then return { someFunction: someFunction };
[17:39] jscheel: AntelopeSalad: you haven't read all the documentation then, one sec
[17:39] gtramont1na: U know what I mean?
[17:40] AntelopeSalad: jsc: nope, i just went to the guide link on the main site and that's all it's giving me
[17:40] jscheel: AntelopeSalad: look under settings, and under view rendering
[17:41] jscheel: AntelopeSalad: for example, here's what I do for jquery template: http://pastie.org/1747942
[17:41] jscheel: AntelopeSalad: again, I've never tried moustache (I probably should) but it's worth a try
[17:42] stonebranch has joined the channel
[17:42] AntelopeSalad: this is definitely a start
[17:42] mscdex: somehow i think moustache should have a filter function called 'shave'

[17:56] jscheel: well, crap, when I initialize a new project, I don't get the error

[18:41] ckknight: onr: coffeescript is easy, just get rid of function, add ->, and remove semicolons :P

[18:45] ncb000gt: yea, i failed to read that
[18:45] ncb000gt: :)

[18:46] trotter has joined the channel
[18:46] ncb000gt: the caching side would be nice, and would add to some nice performance
[18:46] ckknight: yeah, some internal ones, but I plan on cleaning them up
[18:47] ckknight: things are split up and organized in a tree structure so that (in my real-world example) what would theoretically take 700 regexes is down to 35 in the worst-possible case.
[18:47] ncb000gt: ckknight: cool, i'd say, add your reasoning for doing this to the readme, didn't seem to be there
[18:47] ncb000gt: and then also show benchmarking proving your case

[18:55] thiessenp: ckknight: oh lol yes, indeed I do (for some reason I really want it to be called Mongol so I can picture crazy mongoloids on hourses etc. :-)
[18:55] ckknight: mongols and mongoloids are also distinct groups. :P
[18:56] thiessenp: ckknight: ouch will hit wikipedia to learn some history first

[18:56] gtramont1na: lol
[18:57] gtramont1na: hey, speaking of mongodb and node. Does anyone know about any activerecord nodejs implementation?
[18:58] ckknight: Mongoose seemed pretty close as far as getting the job done what one would've used ActiveRecord for
[18:58] ckknight: but their APIs do differ
[18:58] thiessenp: ckknight: ok so mongol is an umbrella term for tribes, one of which was the mongoloids - ok got it :-) Also, cool, will check out mongoose
[18:58] ckknight: no, thiessenp

[19:19] tbranyen: i don't see anything particularly great with this editor
[19:20] lord_pall: cloud apps rule until you drop connection
[19:20] tbranyen: lord_pall: pretty sure this works offline
[19:20] lord_pall: saves local?
[19:20] lord_pall: 49 bucks a month is steep too
[19:20] tbranyen: i'd have to try it, but sure it's not unheard of
[19:20] tbranyen: lord_pall: cloud9 is free?
[19:20] slickplaid: that's for the hosted version
[19:20] lord_pall: free if it's open source
[19:21] slickplaid: npm install cloud9
[19:21] slickplaid: win
[19:21] lord_pall: wait what?
[19:21] lord_pall: derp. That's neat
[19:21] tbranyen: i'll stick with vim tho
[19:22] slickplaid: komodo for me
[19:22] tbranyen: yeah i was using komodo before vim
[19:22] lord_pall: what's the best idiot grade db solution for node? just use the persistence framework?
[19:22] lord_pall: komodo makes me mad
[19:22] lord_pall: it
[19:22] lord_pall: s'
[19:22] lord_pall: oops. It's in a continual state of brokenness for me
[19:22] slickplaid: really? I have yet to have it be broke/crash
[19:22] gtramont1na: That's my point. Downloading and installing it, doesn't give me any advantage over other IDEs (or editors). It is not a cloud app anymore then.
[19:23] slickplaid: compared to eclipse which crashed regularly
[19:23] lord_pall: could be worse. Could be monodevelop. Ha

[19:27] gtramont1na: Cool! I'm not saying that cloud9 is not a good ide. Just wanted to know which are the features that make it different from the other ides.
[19:27] slickplaid: as far as I know, it's written with node.js
[19:27] gtramont1na: yep
[19:28] lord_pall: so with cloud9, how do i get modules?
[19:28] slickplaid: I'm not sure. Maybe just try it out? It'll only cost you a couple keystrokes.

[20:47] Kiba: http://pastie.org/1748527
[20:47] NuckingFuts: The UI was way better in FF4b9 than in the released version, it's pathetic.
[20:48] Kiba: am using nvm
[20:48] Kiba: is that a good idea?
[20:49] NuckingFuts: nvm?
[20:49] Kiba: Node Version Manager
[20:49] Kiba: like rvm, but for node.js
[20:49] Kiba: I did nvm install v0.4.5
[20:49] Kiba: and it comes up with this error
[20:49] Kiba: http://pastie.org/1748527
[20:50] NuckingFuts: Uh IDK
[20:50] NuckingFuts: Never used NVM, what OS is this?
[20:50] tbranyen: looks like the wrong version of python or something
[20:50] DoNaLd`: nave usemain 0.4.5
[20:50] tbranyen: Kiba: python --version is 2 right?
[20:50] NuckingFuts: ACTION retreats and lets others handle it
[20:50] Kiba: 3.2
[20:50] tbranyen: Kiba: ;) thats the issue
[20:51] tbranyen: do you have python2?
[20:51] Kiba: python2 --version
[20:51] Kiba: Python 2.7.1
[20:51] Kiba:  
[20:51] Kiba: yes
[20:52] tbranyen: yeah maybe try symlinking python2 to python
[20:52] tbranyen: Kiba: are you on arch linux?
[20:52] Kiba: yes
[20:52] ncb000gt: or just play with the paths for your nvm install
[20:52] tbranyen: hehehe
[20:52] tbranyen: Kiba: yeah i kind of want to fix up the nodejs python scripts to not fail for us arch users
[20:53] tbranyen: ncb000gt: node will not build with python3 as the default python
[20:53] ParadoxQuine has joined the channel
[20:54] ncb000gt: tbranyen: hence playing with the paths
[20:54] ncb000gt: PATH=/somepath/:$PATH nvm install v0.4.5
[20:54] ncb000gt: should do the trick rather than changing symlinks
[20:55] tbranyen: ah yeah i see what you mean putting the python2 path first
[20:55] ncb000gt: yep
[20:55] tbranyen: i haven't looked back from symlinking tho
[20:55] ncb000gt: sure, and maybe that is fine
[20:55] tbranyen: word isn't ready for python3 yet
[20:55] tbranyen: world*
[20:55] ncb000gt: heh
[20:56] ncb000gt: i haven't moved to py3 yet
[20:56] ncb000gt: still work with 2 when i use python
[20:56] tbranyen: yeah i don't see the point
[20:56] tbranyen: massive api breaking release doesn't entice me
[20:56] ckknight: Python3 has a lot of benefits over Python2
[20:57] ckknight: like sane string handling
[20:57] ckknight: but yeah, API issues...
[20:58] Kiba: hmm
[20:58] Kiba: so I must modify nvm script to use python2
[20:58] Kiba: instead of python
[20:59] matjas has joined the channel
[21:00] Kiba: so you guys suggest that I should get of python3
[21:01] tbranyen: no i suggest that
[21:01] Kiba: and symlink python2 to python?
[21:01] tbranyen: i don't speak for everyone
[21:01] ncb000gt: Kiba: if you don't want to change the symlink try the path bit
[21:02] ncb000gt: PATH=/path/to/python2/bin/dir/:$PATH nvm install v0.4.5
[21:02] Kiba: so
[21:03] Kiba: I have to modify my .bashrc?
[21:03] ncb000gt: no
[21:03] ncb000gt: just type that on the command line
[21:03] Kiba: what if I have to use nvm again?
[21:03] ncb000gt: it'll change the path scoping for that command
[21:03] ncb000gt: then you have to type that again
[21:03] Kiba: ACTION removed python

[22:17] pquerna: pause is advisory
[22:17] pquerna: not absolute
[22:18] paupau: Fair enough
[22:18] paupau: So I should just buffer it instead then I guess

[22:46] Sean_Colombo: other redis commands have worked with this client (incr, lpush, etc.) but this hget is failing.
[22:46] Sean_Colombo: (where failing = never reaching the callback)
[22:48] ParadoxQuine: where does the control flow reach before it just stops? as in, where in the client code?
[22:48] Sean_Colombo: it gets past the code where i add the call... so execution keeps going.  Just the callback never get called.  Like this:
[22:49] Sean_Colombo: console.log("This shows up");

[22:50] Sean_Colombo: ah, foudn it
[22:51] ParadoxQuine: well technically to that /.npm/ but it symlinks he stuff in there to /node/
[22:51] Sean_Colombo: it's /usr/lib/node for me apparentyl

[23:07] saikat has joined the channel
[23:08] pforpal: i am generating C source code within node, lets not get into why
[23:08] dekz: whats d?
[23:08] pforpal: and i want to log the source code which contains a printf("%d", whatever)
[23:08] gerad has joined the channel
[23:09] tfe__ has joined the channel
[23:09] ParadoxQuine: what does console.log("\%d") do?
[23:09] pforpal: so if i escape the % then the source code is incorrect
[23:09] ParadoxQuine: did you try sys.puts?
[23:09] pforpal: thats also NaN
[23:09] pforpal: oh ok let me try sys.puts
[23:10] pforpal: console.log doesnt seem to let me escape no matter what
[23:10] dekz: v8: console.log("%d");
[23:10] v8bot: dekz: "%d"
[23:10] pforpal: > console.log("%d") NaN > 
[23:10] dekz: pastie?
[23:11] pforpal: http://pastie.org/1748915
[23:11] pforpal: that is in the node console

[23:14] aho: try %%
[23:14] pforpal: gives %Nan
[23:14] aho: odd
[23:14] pforpal: very odd
[23:14] Aikar: pforpal: % is for format codes
[23:14] Aikar: you didnt pass one
[23:15] ckknight: pforpal: when it detects % in the first argument, it expects there to be format parameters provided
[23:15] ckknight: v8: console.log("%d", 5)
[23:15] v8bot: ckknight: "%d"
[23:15] ckknight: well that's wrong compared to running node locally (the bot)
[23:15] Aikar: > console.log("%s", 1);
[23:15] Aikar: 1
[23:15] aho: usually those % thingies can be escaped with yet another %
[23:15] pforpal: it doesnt seem to work
[23:16] ckknight: yeah, > console.log("%d%%", 50) gives "50%"
[23:16] pforpal: im not trying to replace %d with an integer
[23:16] Aikar: ckknight: same from wow community? 
[23:16] pforpal: im actually trying to output the string %d
[23:16] ckknight: Aikar: yes
[23:16] Aikar: hi :P lol yeah your name is of course known among wow devs :P
[23:16] ckknight: as well it should be!

[23:17] aho: works fine with java
[23:17] Aikar: but ive retired from games now
[23:17] aho: <:
[23:17] ckknight: don't compare Java to ECMAScript, please.

[23:17] gerad_ has joined the channel
[23:18] aho: i'm sure it works in c/c++, too
[23:18] ckknight: true, my guess is that console.log is miscoded in that case.
[23:18] tbranyen: aho: are you talking about console.log?
[23:18] ParadoxQuine: pforpal: did you do sys.puts?
[23:18] Aikar: err where the hell is dev tools on chrome
[23:18] ParadoxQuine: pforpal: I just tried that and it worked like you want
[23:18] aho: i'm talking about escaping those %d or whatever placeholders with an extra %
[23:18] Aikar: its not on my menu anymore
[23:19] tbranyen: Aikar: ctrl shift i
[23:19] tbranyen: or cmd
[23:19] pforpal: sys.puts("%d") > %d
[23:19] ParadoxQuine: that's what you want right?
[23:19] pforpal: yes it is
[23:19] pforpal: its inconsistent with the rest of my application though
[23:19] pforpal: not a big deal
[23:19] tbranyen: aho: ah because console.log as a function always accepts a list of things to output, this is not the same as printf
[23:19] pforpal: but im also curious why its not possible with console.log
[23:20] tbranyen: so you can do console.log(obj1, obj2, obj3)
[23:20] gtramont1na: Aikar: ctrl+shift+j?
[23:20] Aikar: chrome nor firefox make %%d > %d so really shouldnt in node
[23:20] Aikar: i worked
[23:20] tbranyen: avoids the issue of type coercion
[23:20] aho: that doesn't explain why %%d doesn't work
[23:20] tbranyen: yes it does
[23:20] tbranyen: "%%d" is a string that literally means %%d thats what console.log will output
[23:20] tbranyen: that'd effing suck if it did anything else
[23:21] Aikar: just because other langs may use that format, doesnt mean everything should
[23:21] pforpal: > console.log("%%d") > %NaN > 
[23:21] aho: >>> console.log('asdf %d asdfsadf', 23)
[23:21] aho: asdf 23 asdfsadf
[23:21] aho: >>> console.log('asdf %%d asdfsadf', 23)
[23:21] aho: asdf %d asdfsadf 23
[23:21] aho: works in firefox
[23:21] ckknight: aho: just call it a bug.
[23:21] ckknight: it's clearly buggy if "%%d" doesn't parse to "%d"
[23:21] tbranyen: aho: interesting
[23:21] Aikar: yeah WHEN passing an arg to fill the data in
[23:21] dekz: v8: console.log('asdf %%d asdfsadf', 23)
[23:21] v8bot: dekz: "asdf %%d asdfsadf"
[23:21] aho: >>> console.log('asdf %%d asdfsadf')
[23:21] aho: asdf %d asdfsadf
[23:21] aho: also works
[23:22] dekz: v8: console.log('asdf %d asdfsadf', 23)
[23:22] v8bot: dekz: "asdf %d asdfsadf"
[23:22] aho: in firefox, that is
[23:22] dekz: Oh
[23:22] tbranyen: heh those actually all work for me in node
[23:22] pforpal: im on a mac using homebrew node if that makes a difference?
[23:22] Aikar: that last one deks did seems like a bug
[23:22] Aikar: %d should of been replaced
[23:23] aho: should have :v
[23:23] Aikar: is console.log provided by v8 or node?
[23:23] flasomm_ has joined the channel
[23:23] aho: node
[23:24] aho: v8 itself is pretty naked :>
