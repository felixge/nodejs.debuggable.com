[04:53] Nuck: I'm having issues with two database connections to two different databases on the same redis server (0 and 1), and the entries in 1 are populated at startup, but they eventually disappear despite no TTL settings
[04:53] Tobsn: hu?
[04:53] Nuck: only stuff in DB 1 have TTL
[04:53] Tobsn: you run two redis instances?
[04:53] Nuck: Err, DB 0
[04:53] Nuck: Tobsn: No, one instance, two DBs
[04:54] Tobsn: the fuck?
[04:54] Nuck: I believe it's, uh, SELECT 1
[04:54] Nuck: I think
[04:54] Tobsn: hmm
[04:54] Tobsn: wanna bet one overwrites the second when you SELECT
[04:54] Tobsn: it smells a lot like purging
[04:54] Nuck: yeah there we go
[04:54] DTrejo: redis can have more than one DB inside a single redis?
[04:54] Nuck: Tobsn: Nope, two completely separate connections :/
[04:54] DTrejo: I didn't see that written anywhere
[04:54] Nuck: DTrejo: Yep
[04:54] lightcap has joined the channel
[04:54] Tobsn: DTrejo, seems like it
[04:55] Nuck: DTrejo: SELECT 0-10 IIRC
[04:55] brantwynn has left the channel
[04:55] Tobsn: oh
[04:55] Nuck: DTrejo: SELECT is fully documented on the Redis site
[04:55] Tobsn: maybe 0 gets converted into an empty string
[04:55] DTrejo: oh, ok
[04:55] Tobsn: make sure you do "0"
[04:55] Nuck: No, the databases work fine
[04:55] Nuck: Both work independently
[04:55] Nuck: And gloriously
[04:55] Tobsn: hmm
[04:55] Tobsn: still sounds like purging/overwriting
[04:55] Nuck: But for some reason, the second database disappears over time
[04:56] Tobsn: database disapears means what?
[04:56] DTrejo: wierd
[04:56] Tobsn: the whole file is gone?
[04:56] Tobsn: or its just empty?
[04:56] DTrejo: even worse problems than I'm having lol
[04:56] Nuck: Tobsn: I thought TTL leakage for a while, but I don't set the TTL on the whole database, jsut keys :/
[04:56] Nuck: Tobsn: DB 1 is just empty when the client tries to pull data again :/
[04:56] Tobsn: if its completely empty
[04:56] Tobsn: there is something worse going on
[04:56] Tobsn: check the file size
[04:56] Tobsn: like the file on the file system
[04:57] Nuck: I don't know where Redis stores its shit
[04:57] Tobsn: see config file
[04:57] Nuck: Might all be in one file?
[04:57] Tobsn:  /opt somewhere i guess
[04:57] Nuck: The other database is fine
[04:57] Tobsn: maybe
[04:57] Nuck: Completely unaffected
[04:57] TomY has joined the channel
[04:57] Tobsn: but i would guess it has two files
[04:57] Tobsn: container0 container1
[04:57] Tobsn: that would be the only reason two create databases
[04:57] Tobsn: to separate the written files
[04:57] mikeric has joined the channel
[04:58] Tobsn: hmm or namespacing or something
[04:58] Tobsn: but def. check the files
[04:58] Tobsn: if those suddenly have 0 size or just meta data something kills your content
[04:58] Nuck: I don't know WTF is going on :S
[04:58] Tobsn: lern how to find it out ;)
[04:58] Tobsn: write yourself a script that checks the filesize and content of redis every 5 minutes ;)
[04:58] Tobsn: and pump in test data until it breaks
[04:59] Tobsn: but i bet its just some stupid typo you accidently put in
[04:59] Tobsn: like i said "SELECT " + DB where DB = 0 vs. DB = "0"
[04:59] Tobsn: its always shit like that
[05:00] Nuck: Tobsn: wat
[05:00] Nuck: WTF driver uses raw access o_O
[05:00] Tobsn: who knows idk which driver you use ;)
[05:00] Tobsn: like i said, test everything and make sure your code is 100% correct
[05:00] Nuck: I'm doing tagslist.select(1); and tagscache.select(0);
[05:00] Tobsn: so
[05:01] Tobsn: tagscache.select(0) does that always work?
[05:01] cjm has joined the channel
[05:01] Nuck: Tobsn: hmmm?
[05:01] Nuck: select 0 is a valid thing
[05:01] Nuck: 0 is the default
[05:01] Nuck: I actually don't bother :P
[05:01] Tobsn: what if you do select("0")
[05:01] Nuck: Since it's always on 0
[05:01] Nuck: Tobsn: Nope, doesn't matter
[05:01] Nuck: JS will coerce
[05:01] Tobsn: it seems so odd to do select(0)
[05:01] Nuck: Anyways
[05:01] Tobsn: kinda scares me for some reason
[05:01] Nuck: Tobsn: No, that's how things work
[05:02] Nuck: You're just crazy :)
[05:02] Tobsn: im just overly scared of 0
[05:02] Tobsn: ;)
[05:02] DTrejo: ACTION blurg
[05:02] Tobsn: fyi, if you watch malcom in the middle on netflix, its 16:9 and sometimes you see people standing on the side outside 4:3
[05:03] Tobsn: or a camera crane or a light etc.
[05:03] Tobsn: very funny.

[05:07] a_meteorite: Docs seem to imply it's not safe for streams
[05:07] a_meteorite: No info if the same is true for sockets
[05:08] Tobsn: should be fine
[05:08] Tobsn: just overdo it and see what happens
[05:08] a_meteorite: I wish it were safe for streams... maybe it is and the docs are just lying :)

[05:13] Tobsn: unix timestamp are seconds?
[05:13] DTrejo: blorg
[05:13] DTrejo: wait
[05:14] DTrejo: Returns the remaining time to live of a key that has a timeout. This introspection capability allows a Redis client to check how many seconds a given key will continue to be part of the dataset.
[05:14] Tobsn: ah i see
[05:14] Tobsn: yeah just read it
[05:14] DTrejo: so it shold be something like 30
[05:14] Tobsn: take that timestamp
[05:14] DTrejo: err
[05:14] Tobsn: substract now
[05:14] DTrejo: 20
[05:14] Tobsn: wanna bet?
[05:14] Tobsn: ;)
[05:14] DTrejo: let me try that

[05:18] AAA_awright: Thanks
[05:18] Tobsn: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=node.js+SOCKS+Proxy
[05:18] Tobsn: first result
[05:19] AAA_awright: I already looked
[05:20] Tobsn: DTrejo, if you dont set a TTL it might just spits out now()
[05:20] Tobsn: try setting it 5 minutes in the future in the set() and substract and see if its anywhere near 300
[05:20] DTrejo: hmm ok
[05:20] DTrejo: it's a negative # :
[05:21] DTrejo: number
[05:21] Tobsn: lol
[05:21] DTrejo: yea
[05:21] Tobsn: how much?
[05:21] DTrejo: -1318860890
[05:21] DTrejo: oh wait
[05:21] DTrejo: nvm
[05:21] DTrejo: one sec!
[05:21] Tobsn: is ttl var or is the result?

[05:26] DTrejo: even if it makes no sense

[05:26] Tobsn: but that would defeat the purpose of the callback itself
[05:26] DTrejo: lol yes
[05:26] Tobsn: well if i were you
[05:26] Tobsn: i would do cases
[05:27] Tobsn: one where you set the ttl directly with set() if thats possible
[05:27] Tobsn: and another one where you set the expireat and check the ttl a second later
[05:27] maletor has joined the channel
[05:27] Tobsn: with a timeout
[05:27] Tobsn: just to be _sure_
[05:27] Tobsn: its not a expireat callback issue

[05:27] Tobsn: use the redis client in a shell to check it directly
[05:28] fzzzy has joined the channel
[05:28] Tobsn: 3 ways to check the sanity of the whole process
[05:28] DTrejo: the one on redis.io?

[10:22] adrianmg: Anyone with an iphone? -.-
[10:23] rgl: tuhoojabotti, you are saying that node does not ship with a htmlencode function at all?
[10:24] Lingerance: To close node without process.exit() you need to close every socket and timeout/interval among other things.  (From my experience)
[10:25] tuhoojabotti: rgl: escape function?
[10:25] tuhoojabotti: it's not related to node at all :u
[10:25] rgl: tuhoojabotti, escape is URI encoding.
[10:25] tuhoojabotti: right
[10:25] mraleph has joined the channel
[10:26] Lingerance: escape != URI encoding normally.
[10:26] tuhoojabotti: true
[10:26] Lingerance: node has encodeURI() though
[10:26] rgl: I see.
[10:27] rgl: well, JS is a mess for encoding a simple html string :(
[10:27] Lingerance: Why are you encoding HTML anyways?
[10:27] rgl: I mean, the stock functions do not even seem to have HTML encoding at all :(
[10:27] rgl: for emiting HTML from a HTTP handler
[10:27] Lingerance: Because 99% of people don't need that
[10:28] rgl: what do you mean?
[10:28] Lingerance: You shouldn't need to encode HTML if that's what gets sent back.
[10:28] tuhoojabotti: rgl: http://search.npmjs.org/#/node-html-encoder
[10:28] tuhoojabotti: That's why we have modules.

[13:12] einaros: try that

[13:13] Marak: it seems fast
[13:13] einaros: not as much server response time, seeing as the page is currently hosted by one of my other node boxes

[19:37] Cheery: PeeterHome: to be exact.. do you just look for a way to store information about user accounts or are you looking for a thing that handles HTTP Digest?
[19:37] smathy: I have an "event style programming" sort of question.  I know this code is wrong, but I just hacked it up quickly to give you an idea of what I'm trying to work through: https://gist.github.com/1306400
[19:38] gxdssoft has joined the channel
[19:39] smathy: The question is really, how can I block? :)  Although, more generally, how can I deal with these situations where I want to do something AFTER a bunch of non-blocking calls have been run?
[19:40] Cheery: there may be a command which allows that.. but are you sure you want to block?
[19:40] smathy: No, not sure I want to block at all :)  I just can't work out how else to code: "do this after doing all these other things"
[19:41] Cheery: you could make the in_foobar_queue take one or two functions that are called if you find the thing in queue :)
[19:41] smathy: Cheery… sure, but I also want an "else" case.
[19:41] Cheery: well. one that is called when it matches and another called when it doesn't
[19:41] smathy: Cheery… ie. I want to do something different if the thing isn't found in the queue (sorry, that's not clear from my code).
[19:42] Cheery: it is very well
[19:42] avih has joined the channel
[19:42] Cheery: many async code written in node.js this way has that property of having error handler. :)
[19:42] voodootikigod_: does anyone know why expresso is no longer including -I / --include when running node 0.5.x?
[19:42] voodootikigod_: and or if it is something that will be fixed?
[19:42] smathy: Cheery… but how to get the "if it doesn't" thing with non-blocking calls?
[19:43] smathy: ...I suppose I'd just have to have queue_array.length nested functions?
[19:43] Skipants has joined the channel
[19:43] smathy: Each only being called if the value is not found, to check the next value?
[19:44] Cheery: yeah. it looks similar to manifest -pattern. :)
[19:44] smathy: ...and I guess this is where things like Tame come into their own.
[19:45] Cheery: Tame?
[19:45] smathy: http://tamejs.org/
[19:47] Cheery: yep
[19:47] Cheery: there would be lot to say about the complicatedness async code has caused into javascript
[19:47] Cheery: and how the language doesn't just stand on it. :)
[19:49] Cheery: await in tamejs is equivalent to that manifest pattern btw.
[19:49] Cheery: smathy: in games and such you want to load game resources all at once.. and get rid of them later when you think they aren't useful.
[19:49] smathy: It's funny because that TameJS structure immediately reminds me of synchronized blocks in thread programming.  It's like there are problems where blocking is just necessary (or at least: far simpler).
[19:50] Cheery: well.. async programming is way to go and way much more cooler than threads. :)

[20:26] eddyb: hmm, what is more "superior" right now?
[20:26] eddyb: waf or gyp?

[20:50] eddyb: wait, why is scons mentioned in wscript?
[20:50] eddyb: really?
[20:50] konobi: scons == wscript

[20:53] konobi: eddyb: waf sits atop scons
[20:53] eddyb: really?
[20:54] konobi: waf is a PITA... so ryan decided to move to gyp... v8 is moving that way too i believe

[20:56] eddyb: only the C++ code will be different (and quite smaller on my side)
[20:56] rendar: gyp?
[20:57] eddyb: konobi: any ideas what state is windows in?
[20:57] eddyb: not supported, barely supported?
[20:57] konobi: supported
[20:57] konobi: 0.5 -> 0.6
[20:57] eddyb: with visual c++?
[20:57] RexM: If I have multiple domains pointed at the same application ex: <username>.domain.com, how do I figure out the domain that's being requested? currently if I look at request.url, it's just /
[20:57] konobi: yup... hence use of gyp
[20:57] eddyb: my approach requires C++11, so I'm trying to stick with mingw

[22:26] Aria: The real code is in libuv.
[22:26] Tobsn: aaah
[22:27] Aria: The strict separation is win. They've done a bang-up job with libuv.

[22:27] deedubs1 has joined the channel

[22:28] rayfinkle: is there a specific unit testing framework that has a notable advantage over the others?
[22:28] rayfinkle: \
[22:28] Aria: inotify scales pretty high.
[22:28] mape: seems heavier to add a watcher to all files, plus it wouldn't find new files?
[22:28] Tobsn: what is it looking out for when watching a directory?

[22:29] Aria: That's tiny by inotify standards.

[22:31] chilts: it seems like it

[22:32] Aria: Yeah. Tap then.
[22:32] chilts: and that I know the surface area of :)
[22:32] Aria: vows is awesome, but big and doesn't output tap.
[22:32] Aria: "big" .. still small, but bigger than tap.

[22:40] aeo: So I'm getting the error "FATAL ERROR: JS Allocation failed - process out of memory"
[22:40] aeo: It's not coming with any sort of stack trace or anything like that. :/
[22:40] aeo: Do you guys know how one goes about fixing this sort of thing?
[22:41] monokrome: aeo: V8 ran out of RAM to work with. It has a hard coded memory limit.
[22:41] aeo: monokrome: I realize this. It means there's probably a memory leak in my code. Do you know how I should go about finding it?
[22:41] aeo: Most Node errors come with a stack trace which makes it relatively easy.
[22:41] aeo: This one doesn't. :/
[22:42] Tobsn: strace
[22:42] Tobsn: maybe
[22:42] monokrome: Is it a memory leak, or are you just doing something that uses a lot of memory?
[22:44] AvianFlu: that's the gentler form of an infinite loop
[22:44] Aria: strace won't show memory much. Valgrind is the tool for that, but that's a pain.
[22:44] AvianFlu: the other being "max call stack size exceeded"
[22:44] perezd has joined the channel
[22:44] AvianFlu: node-inspector and v8-profiler would be better, probably
[22:45] aeo: monokrome: My guess is a memory leak. I can't think of anything that uses _tons_ of memory.
[22:45] AvianFlu: so what's the application trying to do?

[22:47] AvianFlu: or after a while
[22:47] aeo: AvianFlu: It's after a while
[22:47] aeo: Fairly rarely.
[22:47] aeo: Usually another part of my code crashes and I discover a bug in my code
[22:48] aeo: But every once in a while it runs out of memory before that happens
[22:49] aeo: My code isn't exactly the most optimized thing in the world.
[22:49] AvianFlu: yeah, you be leakin' memory
[22:49] aeo: But I can't imagine 10 or so users and 2 battles is enough to run out of memory
[22:49] aeo: No matter how badly optimized my code is
[22:49] AvianFlu: the approach that would take the least thinking: put a console.log next to places where you're making a new one of something
[22:49] AvianFlu: see if you're accidentally doing something a whole lot
[22:50] AvianFlu: see if there are places you can delete something
[22:50] AvianFlu: the word 'new' in a tight loop, for example, would bear looking at
[22:50] einaros: I don't think I've ever managed to leak memory in js
[22:51] aeo: The word "new" happens when someone connects, and when someone creates a battle. I'm pretty sure that's it.
[22:51] aeo: You know
[22:51] aeo: I just realized
[22:52] aeo: The console's been spamming "possible memory leak detected"
[22:52] aeo: You'd think I would've made the connection that my running out of memory has to do with that

[22:54] Tobsn: its a command
[22:54] aeo: Where does it go?
[22:54] DPGame: if anybody have to store variables in the client, use localStorage ... its easy and great :D
[22:54] Tobsn: strace node app.js
[22:54] Tobsn: its a command
[22:54] Tobsn: ;)
[22:54] Tobsn: linux
[22:54] Tobsn: it traces your whatever
[22:54] monokrome: DPGame: just remember a fallback for old browsers! :)
[22:55] Tobsn: see the stackoverflow article
[22:55] einaros: aeo: the xhr bits of socket.io may very well leak. what happens if you poke it through websockets?
[22:55] aeo: einaros: What do you mean?
[22:55] DPGame: mono yes, but if i have to use canvas i could use localStorage ;D
[22:55] einaros: (although the leak is probably you adding event listeners you aren't cleaning up)
[22:55] Tobsn: aeo, another one: http://tstarling.com/blog/2010/06/measuring-memory-usage-with-strace/
[22:55] DPGame: every browser which supports canvas supports localStorage... i think
[22:55] einaros: aeo: meaning: try chrome 14+, do the same and see if it works
[22:55] aeo: einaros: I'm supposed to clean up event listeners? :S This explains a lot.
[22:56] aeo: einaros: Well, I mean, I can't guarantee what browsers my users use. :S
[22:56] einaros: aeo: well that depends. if what you are listening on is permanent, while the listening party is transient: yes you have to clean it up
[22:56] einaros: otherwise the reference from the listened-upon to the listener will keep the listener alive
[22:56] einaros: and the gc will never collect it
[22:57] aeo: http://dev.pokemonshowdown.com/data/battle-server.js
[22:57] aeo: This is my app.js, can you tell me if I'm using event listeners correctly? :S
[22:57] einaros: aeo: regarding the xhr bits, I don't really know how they act. but I've used socket.io extensively, and I built a couple of the websocket parsers there, so I know that most of it is fine
[22:58] DPGame: aeo there is a big security issue - i think
