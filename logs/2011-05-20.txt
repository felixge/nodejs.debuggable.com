[00:07] chapel: well, thats not the problem, its just its a non standard irc log format, so any existing tools for parsing logs are useless
[00:07] chapel: then again, its not hard to parse

[00:59] dguttman_ has joined the channel
[01:00] a|i: haskel is bootifool.
[01:00] mjr_: a|i: you need to use JSON.stringify in most cases, unless your objects are simple enough to directly map to a redis hash.
[01:00] tjholowaychuk: erlang is pretty simple, would love it way more if BEAM was not so huge
[01:00] mjr_: Is beam really that much larger than node+v8?
[01:00] tjholowaychuk: oh yeah
[01:00] tjholowaychuk: big time
[01:00] aaronblohowiak: it also does a lot more.
[01:00] tjholowaychuk: takes forever to compile
[01:01] mjr_: Doesn't seem to use much more memory.
[01:01] mjr_: But dear lord, what a lot of source code.
[01:01] beriberikix__ has joined the channel
[01:01] a|i: mjr_: even if the object is not simple enough, what's the overhead of json stringify/parse?

[01:01] jTNT: ACTION likes lisp
[01:01] mjr_: It's pretty good.
[01:02] Tobsn: hmm if console.log shows me something as [Object] how can i find out whats in it?!
[01:03] mjr_: V8 does a pretty good job at making JSON fast, but you probably won't notice it unless your objects are larger than a few KB as strings.
[01:03] mjr_: Unless you do.
[01:03] mjr_: I JSON in all directions, sizes, and shapes.
[01:03] zivester has joined the channel

[01:04] jmoyers: https://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO-node-client
[01:04] mjr_: aaronblohowiak: Yeah, there is msgpack, or just doing your own simple format.
[01:04] neoesque has joined the channel
[01:04] a|i: mjr_: objects are very small, but there will be many many read/writes to redis. now json serializer/deserializer will be on top of it.
[01:05] kersny: Tobsn: console.dir
[01:05] Tobsn: ah
[01:05] pyrony has joined the channel
[01:06] mjr_: a|i: Really only one way to find out if it's fast enough.  
[01:06] dhasenan: When I install libraries with npm, do I need to do anything special to get them into NODE_PATH, or will they get there automatically?
[01:06] a|i: is msgpack really 10x faster than json, or their benchmark has a catch? (http://msgpack.org/)
[01:07] mjr_: The only time I've seen JSON be the bottleneck in node is when some objects accidentally grew to over 1MB in size.  Then it gets expensive.
[01:07] fakewaffle has joined the channel
[01:07] pedrobelo has joined the channel
[01:07] mjr_: You need to look at the node msgpack implementation.  I seem to recall that it was like 5X faster than JSON for some things.
[01:07] mscdex: yes! microsoft is going to release the source to vb6!
[01:08] mjr_: But man, I'm glad I just use JSON everywhere.
[01:08] a|i: mjr_: the front page indicates 10x: http://msgpack.org/
[01:08] mjr_: Worth the extra CPU for easier debugging and more compatbility. 
[01:08] mscdex: someone had a benchmark showing json was faster than msgpack
[01:08] mscdex: for node 0.4.7
[01:08] mjr_: https://github.com/pgriess/node-msgpack
[01:08] aaronblohowiak: https://github.com/aikar/wormhole/issues/3
[01:09] a|i: mscdex: msgpack is binary, binary doesn't need parsing? why should it be slower?
[01:09] sechrist: is msgpack it's own thing or is it nice c-structs for node?
[01:09] aaronblohowiak: that issue claims that node-msgpack is no longer faster than json as of a v8 ver bump
[01:09] sechrist: because I want json-declared c-structs for network i/o
[01:09] aaronblohowiak: sechrist: what you want are protocol buffers, than
[01:09] sechrist: nope, those are it's own thing
[01:09] mjr_: msgpack claims to be faster than pb as well.
[01:09] mscdex: a|i: don't ask me, the results are on the mailing list somewhere though
[01:09] sechrist: I mean for implementing random binary protocols in node
[01:10] sechrist: for existing architectures
[01:10] aaronblohowiak: sechrist: oh msgpack is its own thing, then. 
[01:10] sechrist: granted it's not hard in C, but a json syntax for rapid prototyping would just be baller
[01:10] mjr_: Check the readme on that github repo for node-msgpack. For that particular object, which is very small, it is slightly faster in one direction, and LOTS faster in the other.
[01:10] nexxy: mscdex, why are you excited for vb6?
[01:10] sechrist: with the byte alignment being one of the properties, and endianness

[02:25] carlodell: *node
[02:26] carlodell: I also have an 'npm' folder in ~/
[02:26] zeedre: carlodell, we're at the same spot. thats funny. 
[02:26] zeedre: Where do you guys recommend to install node on a server?
[02:27] Marak: bad internets
[02:27] darshanshankar: where as in directory location or what server to install on?
[02:27] carlodell: I'm just trying to run it locally for now
[02:27] mikegerwitz: zeedre: I just install node in the home folder of the user it will ultimately run as
[02:28] zeedre: mg :Hmm. I guess thats the easiest.  
[02:28] mikegerwitz: zeedre: Otherwise, the default installation dir is fine.
[02:29] sourcode has joined the channel
[02:29] zeedre: yup, I followed the tutorial on https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation and then realized I was logged in as teh wrong user.
[02:29] indutny has joined the channel
[02:29] mikegerwitz: zeedre: My reasons were simply so that nothing else on the box would have access to the executable. You may not have that requirement.
[02:30] zeedre: I can't imagine its as easy as jst moving the install dir. Can I just delete it?
[02:30] zeedre: and start over with the right user?
[02:30] willwhite has joined the channel
[02:30] mikegerwitz: zeedre: delete it or I think there's a `make uninstall`..last I checked
[02:31] carlodell: How would I debug this?
[02:31] joe_ingersoll has joined the channel
[02:31] carlodell: Where does require() look in?
[02:31] olalonde: ./node_modules/
[02:31] mikegerwitz: zeedre: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.7/api/modules.html
[02:32] mikegerwitz: carlodell*
[02:32] mikegerwitz: sorry
[02:32] mikegerwitz: carlodell: You can also do console.log( require.paths ) to see what you have set up
[02:32] carlodell: inside my project folder?
[02:32] carlodell: oh ok
[02:32] mikegerwitz: carlodell: for node_modules, it will traverse downward until it finds it
[02:33] zeedre: I don't think there is a make uninstall. I see makefile. 
[02:34] mikegerwitz: zeedre: there is :) just tried it
[02:34] mikegerwitz: zeedre: you just type `make uninstall` in the root src dir
[02:34] mikegerwitz: Where the makefile is
[02:34] qrux has joined the channel

[02:38] mikegerwitz: carlodell: What command did you run to install it? I'm not too familiar  with npm, but I'll try to work through it
[02:39] mikegerwitz: carlodell: (did you install with -g, or just 'npm install foo')
[02:39] carlodell: mikegerwitz: just npm install now
[02:40] mikegerwitz: carlodell: from what I've heard issacs say in here, it should install to ./node_modules. Check the directory you ran the command in. Does it exist there?
[02:41] carlodell: The directory I installed node to?
[02:41] mikegerwitz: carlodell: the directory you ran 'npm install' in
[02:42] carlodell: no, let me try making it
[02:42] mikegerwitz: carlodell: You won't want to make it manually :) it should do it for you. If not, we'll have to figure out why
[02:43] mikegerwitz: carlodell: what version of npm are you using?
[02:43] pyrony has joined the channel
[02:44] carlodell: 1.0
[02:44] mikegerwitz: carlodell: With 1.0.6, I ran `npm install now` and it did put node_modules in my current dir

[02:52] sechrist has joined the channel
[02:53] mikegerwitz: zeedre: I'm pretty sure that's the default. But to be explicit: ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/bin

[02:54] Guest9038: hi, guys
[02:54] zeedre: no * either right?
[02:54] mikegerwitz: zeedre: yep. Just /usr/local
[02:54] mikegerwitz: Guest9038: heya
[02:55] Guest9038: what will u guys do if u want to use 'Hash' in javascript ?? 
[02:55] olalonde: you can use an object as an hash
[02:55] olalonde: although keys can only be strings
[02:56] olalonde: you mean an hash map right?
[02:56] skm has joined the channel
[02:56] Guest9038: I saw a library (_https://github.com/XianYeeXing/xHash), it provides a set of wrapper APIs, but I don't know whether it's good or not
[02:57] Guest9038: javascript Array cannot handle push/pop for key/value pair ( only index-based can work )

[02:58] temp01 has joined the channel
[02:58] Guest9038: there is another one, _https://github.com/ahoward/hashish
[02:58] olalonde: Guest9038: not sure I'd use this, it extends a base class' prototype (Object)
[02:58] Guest9038: but seems more complex ...
[02:59] mikegerwitz: v8: var foo = { bar: 'baz' }; foo.bar2 = 'baz2'; foo
[02:59] v8bot: mikegerwitz: {bar:"baz",bar2:"baz2"}
[02:59] Guest9038: olalonde, yup. so it'not good ???
[02:59] Guest9038: i mean , to augment object is not good ?
[03:00] jscheel has joined the channel
[03:00] jscheel has joined the channel
[03:01] Guest9038: so maybe hashish is a better choice ? i know javascript object can perform like a hash, but it lacks some methods to manupulate data
[03:01] olalonde: Guest9038: from  http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/#object.prototype: The only good reason for extending a built-in prototype is to backport the features of newer JavaScript engines; for example, Array.forEach.
[03:02] Guest9038: thx !!!! let me check it ~

[03:04] jerrysv has joined the channel
[03:04] olalonde: Guest9038: don't use an array for hashed, use an object. you can delete elements like this: delete obj.key;
[03:04] qrux: Howdy—I'm new here.  Is anyone working with Express who could answer a basic question?
[03:04] Guest9038: ok'
[03:05] nexxy: qrux, you'll never know until you ask!
[03:06] qrux: LOL—I'm working through the examples on the Guide, and am trying to configure an app (obtained though: var app require('express').createServer() )...
[03:06] jesusabdullah: Guest9038: Hashish is handy. It just wraps your object and gives you some handy dandy extras.
[03:06] jesusabdullah: Guest9038: and you can get your resulting object back out the other side, so that's not really a concern
[03:06] qrux: Later on, the guide talks about configuring the app (with app.configure(…) ), but references a variable 'express'...
[03:06] olalonde: Guest9038: check this out: http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/
[03:06] qrux: …Which doesn't seem to be in scope.
[03:07] Guest9038: GOT IT
[03:08] meso has joined the channel
[03:08] xtianw: qrux: You usually require modules at the top of the file like var express = require('express');
[03:08] xtianw: That's the convention it's assuming
[03:08] qrux: Right.  Through 'var app = require('express').createServer();'
[03:09] qrux: There's obviously something else required...
[03:09] eyesUnclouded has joined the channel
[03:09] xtianw: Right, but instead do var express = require('express'); var app = express.createServer();
[03:09] Corren has joined the channel
[03:10] seivan has joined the channel
[03:10] Guest9038: olalonde, how about modify xHash ( it's codes are just few lines XD ) to avoid extend object.prototype ?
[03:10] olalonde: Guest9038: you could do that too. it's not a big deal either, but I don't see why you need a hash library anyways when you could just use native objects
[03:10] hileon has joined the channel
[03:11] JackeyChan has joined the channel
[03:11] qrux: xtianw: Thanks.  Are all node.JS modules built this way, i.e., with the convention of initializing a "module global" as the result of 'require'?
[03:11] xtianw: Yep
[03:11] yhahn1 has joined the channel
[03:12] xtianw: Sometimes you have to initialize a constructor with 'new' or something
[03:12] Guest9038: olalonde, mm, i want operate objects with key/value fashion and with some stack / pop features 
[03:12] Emmanuel__ has joined the channel
[03:12] Guest9038: also, I want to have some handy method to manipulate data in objects
[03:13] mikegerwitz: Guest9038: If you want a stack, use an array. If you want to simypl remove values from a hash, use delete.
[03:13] Guest9038: but
[03:13] Guest9038: array does has push/pop
[03:13] mikegerwitz: Guest9038: pushing values onto a hash table doesn't really make sense, since a hash table is nothing like a stack. They're two separate data structures.
[03:13] Guest9038: but only works when using number to index data
[03:13] deedubs has joined the channel
[03:14] Guest9038: yup, i  know
[03:14] gazumps has joined the channel
[03:14] Guest9038: but i want to stack up incoming connections and index them with their ip
[03:14] Emmanuel_ has joined the channel
[03:15] Guest9038: also i need to schedule them in queue-like manner
[03:16] Guest9038: if only use number as index, javascript Array can do that 
[03:16] mikegerwitz: Guest9038: But if you're treating it like a stack or a queue, you don't need to reference it like a hash. Because you'll always push/pop, shift/unshift()
[03:16] Guest9038: yup
[03:16] mikegerwitz: Guest9038: So I guess I'm confused
[03:16] Guest9038: but i do need remove one of them as a hash by key
[03:17] mikegerwitz: Guest9038: Generally one will use two structures for that. One will be the stack/queue, the other will be a map to the index.
[03:17] qrux: Guest9038: You want the keys stored in a stack (though you haven't really explained why you need that).  And the values can be stored in the hash.  Just find something that expresses your set semantics, and store the keys (IP addrs) there.  And then access the value (socket?) through the hash once you  have the key you want...
[03:19] mikegerwitz: Guest9038: If you want to encapsulate that functionalty, that's understandable and that makes more sense. In which case a library may be suitable. But that's no longer just a "hash". It's a wrapper around two separate data structures.
[03:19] Guest9038: qrux, almost ( and the connection is actually a wrapper of nodeJS http request object )
[03:19] qrux: Array has the set semantics you want (though you'll want to be careful with stuff like delete—because it deletes the key/value, but leaves a hole) - http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_array.asp.

[05:10] jesusabdullah: mjr_: What kind of stuff would you use redis for, over say couch or sql?
[05:11] mjr_: It's pretty handy for pub/sub, and for things where you need to share state between processes
[05:11] mjr_: Also if you have something that changes a lot, and you wouldn't mind losing the last few minutes of updates on a crash/power failure.

[05:27] olalonde: Embedable Javascript Bitcoin miner for your website
[05:27] context: its in npm. so im guessing its very simple.
[05:27] olalonde: who stole my idea :D ?
[05:28] giby: oh cool, any links on how to get started with it from npm? like perhaps its name? :)
[05:28] context: do people actually use that bitcoin stuff
[05:28] samsonjs has joined the channel
[05:28] giby: olalonde: the idea of disitbuted computing through the browser is really cool, but the economics of that bitcoin implementation are horrible
[05:28] context: uhh. it says the package name is "closure"
[05:28] context: similar to what you asked for
[05:28] context: http://search.npmjs.org/#/closure
[05:29] giby: thanks :)

[05:33] context: huh
[05:33] context: so.. you can make like real money with this bitcoin crap ?
[05:34] mjr_: So did Marak lose real money somehow?  What's that whole controversy?
[05:34] mjr_: I assume it is some kind of gag of which I only get 25%
[05:35] Marak: mjr_: im selling my left over coins for $100 a piece
[05:35] Marak: mjr_: i blew all my internet money on fake fiats

[05:36] johnnywengluu: how do i couple a spawned process stdout to stdin on my process
[05:36] giby: but the 'making money with it' part is not very rosy
[05:36] giby: it's mostly just a currency
[05:36] context: im so confused
[05:36] johnnywengluu: so whatever is printed out there is printed out to my console
[05:36] matjas has joined the channel
[05:36] johnnywengluu: var spawned_child_process = child_process.spawn(command, args);

[05:36] secoif has joined the channel
[05:36] mjr_: An international decentralized currency is kind of cool.
[05:36] context: so... my cpu crunches hashes, and it poops out eCoins. then i buy stuff?
[05:36] Marak: mjr_: if there is no central authority, what stops someone from just stealing coins
[05:37] mjr_: Hey man, I just skim the title of hacker news, I have no idea how it actually works.
[05:37] giby: sort of. the computational power is really just a way to distribute the initial currency + provide some cryptographic integrity to the network
[05:37] context: they say its uncrackable... so its designed to only 'create' these jelly beans so frequently and slow down as time goes on or something
[05:37] giby: the rewards for doing the 'mining' is very marginal
[05:37] Marak: mjr_: :-p
[05:37] context: i still dont get it
[05:38] giby: it's a distributed network of transactions
[05:38] Guest9038: hello, guys
[05:38] giby: you can send someone bitcoins by broadcasting the transaction to the network and signing it with your private key
[05:38] mjr_: context: there's some value to people using their CPU time for things.
[05:38] giby: which the network verifies because it has the public key to the coins you are transfering
[05:38] mikey_p: Marak: the rest of the network keeps you from stealing coins, it checks for double spending and gives you confirmation for your transactions
[05:39] giby: a distributed database of transactions*
[05:39] Guest9038: olalonde,  a u here ?
[05:39] Marak: mikey_p: i think you misunderstand
[05:39] Marak: mikey_p: i meant like, give me your bitcoins this is a stickup
[05:39] context: so people pay bitcoins to use my cpu?
[05:39] mikey_p: some thing that keeps people from stealing dollars?
[05:39] mikey_p: s/some/same/
[05:40] Guest9038: looks different, the hash library, anyone checked it ? _https://github.com/XianYeeXing/xHash
[05:40] Marak: if there are no game masters then the game is controlled by the players
[05:40] sherod has joined the channel
[05:40] giby: the cpu need is for signing blocks of transactions
[05:40] context: but certain people can take real money and turn it into bitcoins
[05:40] giby: your goal is to find a hash of the last n transactions such that the first x digits of the SHA256 hash are 0
[05:40] context: so it IS centralized.
[05:41] giby: they only turn it into bitcoins by trading with other users
[05:41] giby: not a centralized distributor
[05:41] Marak: Guest9038: dude hrmm?
[05:41] Marak: Guest9038: why use that library? 
[05:42] olalonde: Guest9038: yep
[05:42] giby: marak: there will still be banks, just no central bank
[05:42] context: holy shit
[05:42] context: bitcoins have there own stock market
[05:42] Marak: context: you bet ya
[05:42] context: giby: still dont get it. :/
[05:43] giby: yea, for some definition of 'stock market'
[05:43] mikey_p: context: many many markets
[05:43] mikey_p: technically it's a commodity and not a stock
[05:43] mikey_p: http://bitcoincharts.com/markets/
[05:43] giby: mikey_p: I think he is talking about this http://glbse.com/
[05:43] giby: buying stocks in bitcoin based companies for bitcoins
[05:43] mikey_p: technically a currency, not commodity

[05:44] johnnywengluu: or maybe its the other way around?
[05:45] fakewaffle: holy shit, i took an app i wrote in CakePHP and am now using it in PieJS, and just changed the syntax and it worked no problem
[05:45] johnnywengluu: to print out messages to console from that spawned child process
[05:45] olalonde: v8: var hash = {}; hash['key1'] = 'val1'; hash['key2'] = 'val2'; for(var key in hash) {console.log(hash[key]);}

[05:50] tonymilne: Sup bickie
[05:50] Guest9038: sorry i just answered a phone call
[05:50] bickie: yo lads!
[05:50] bickie: got a quick question
[05:50] bickie: I have some node stuff that does very HTTP requests against an API
[05:50] bickie: obviously, sometimes they fail
[05:50] bickie: so you might get a 403 (rate limit exceeded)
[05:50] Guest9038: olalonde, thx, i am still digesting the materials u sent to me
[05:50] bickie: or a 500 (something very broken)
[05:51] bickie: ro whatever
[05:51] bickie: the error gets noticed and called, ie: callback(err)
[05:51] bickie: however
[05:51] bickie: in the calling code
[05:51] bickie: how do you tell the difference between the types of error?
[05:51] johnnywengluu: spawned_child_process.stdout.pipe(process.stdout);
[05:51] bickie: because by the time it gets up to that level, it's a JS Error object
[05:51] johnnywengluu: that was the answer
[05:52] bickie: which basically have no attributes other than err.message
[05:52] mscdex: bickie: error.code iirc
[05:52] mscdex: oh hmm
[05:52] bickie: err has no native err.code
[05:52] tonymilne: bickie: is response populated? Try: response.statusCode
[05:52] gibybo: response.statusCode
[05:52] gibybo: oh dang I was too slow :(
[05:52] bickie: yeah, so I have it in response.statusCode (in the lib)
[05:53] MikhX has joined the channel
[05:53] bickie: but it gets lost as soon as callback(err) is called
[05:53] mscdex: huh?
[05:53] bickie: so, say the behaviour is to return some different response to the user
[05:53] bickie: or delay further fetching
[05:53] bickie: or whatever
[05:54] mscdex: do you have a simple example you can gist?
[05:54] bickie: that's not going to much further up the chain
[05:54] bickie: yer
[05:54] bickie: that might help :)
[05:54] ivanfi has joined the channel
[05:54] Guest9038: Marak: because I want a 'object collection'', which can pop data out, push data in, shift data out, slice and splice data just like javascript Array does, but Array methods don't work on key/value pairs !
[05:55] bickie: Guest9038: what about an array of objects?
[05:55] Guest9038: Marak: Array object can has key/pair element , but Array methods desn't work on it.
[05:56] mscdex: afaik objects have no guaranteed ordering
[05:56] Guest9038: bickie, yup, but what if u want ti get object by key instead of  iindex number
[05:56] mscdex: so you can't just use it like a stack
[05:57] tonymilne: underscore.js for the win... just makes arrays/object collections work. ;)
[05:57] bickie: JS doesn't have the concept of sorted K/V entity (ie: dict/hash)
[05:57] bickie: like python
[05:58] Guest9038: bickie, it dose not, like Ruby ^^
[05:58] bickie: yep
[05:58] bickie: but yeah, something like underscore may have some magic to help you
[05:58] Guest9038: so I got one utility: _https://github.com/XianYeeXing/xHash
[05:58] mscdex: Guest9038: why do you need this combined type of access?

[06:00] mscdex: heh
[06:00] Marak: i hope i did
[06:00] Guest9038: mscdex, yup, but in reality, sometimes u needs some tricks to get thing down
[06:01] tonymilne: Is there any global way of listening to emitted events?
[06:01] Guest9038: mscdex, for instance, RESTful is cool, but there r some restricts, so Twitter uses semi-RESTful scheme, that's a compromise
[06:01] mscdex: Guest9038: i think the best you're going to be able to do is use an array of objects and just have a method that loops over it to find the object you want

[06:02] Murugaratham: can node do soap?
[06:04] tonymilne: "Using Node for SOAP is sacrilege. The two are diametrically opposed in their philosophies, and SOAP will easily negate any performance gains you might have made from using an event-drive server." - mahmud, via http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1661024
[06:04] mscdex: Guest9038: just so you know, that module isn't doing anything magical
[06:04] dgathright has joined the channel
[06:04] mscdex: it's just wrappers around loops over the object
[06:04] tonymilne: LOL, dunno how truthful that is, but it is funny nonetheless. 
[06:05] mscdex: and it's making bad assumptions about key ordering
[06:05] SubStack: node is turing computable so sure it can do soap
[06:05] SubStack: as unpleasant as soap can be

[06:07] Guest9038: mscdex, i want to download it and do some change, what's 'key ordering' ?
[06:07] mscdex: bickie: if you're talking about the error object emitted from the 'error' event, then it's going to be a connection or lower-level issue
[06:07] neorab has joined the channel
[06:07] tlrobinson: is "binary" not a valid encoding for readFileSync?
[06:08] mscdex: tlrobinson: you don't need it, it'll return a Buffer if you don't specify an encoding
[06:08] bickie: mscdex: Yeah, I know, but I want to know which :)
[06:08] tlrobinson: k thanks
[06:08] Marak: tlrobinson: im totally gonna get more internet money then you have real money, try to stop me http://www.helpingmarak.net/
[06:08] bickie: for example, I'm using it in parallel queue processing
[06:08] bickie: and I need to know whether it's a temporary failure
[06:08] bickie: or permanent
[06:08] bickie: so I can reschedule or mark as failed
[06:08] mscdex: bickie: could be several things i suppose, is there an errno property set?
[06:08] bickie: but in the queue processing code, it seems impossible  to know what sort of error
[06:09] bickie: nope, no properties set
[06:09] mscdex: no properties?
[06:09] mscdex: util.inspect(err, true) ?
[06:09] bickie: (just message)
[06:09] tlrobinson: Marak: are you kidding me? you bought $50k in bitcoins then lost them?
[06:09] bickie: { stack: [Getter/Setter],
[06:09] bickie:   arguments: undefined,
[06:09] bickie:   message: 'hi, I am an error',
[06:09] bickie:   type: undefined }
[06:09] bickie: same for generated errors
[06:10] mscdex: bickie: node does not have its own set of defined error numbers for 'error' event errors
[06:10] bickie: no
[06:10] tlrobinson: Marak: i just sent you 0.01 BTC to get you started
[06:10] bickie: also, JS has no error subclassing
[06:11] bickie: in other languages you'd have like: throw HTTPError(code=500, message="oh dear")
[06:11] bickie: etc
[06:11] Marak: Thanks tlrobinson :-)
[06:11] bickie: in JS it appears there's only Error(message)
[06:11] bickie: nothing else
[06:11] bickie: (well, ecmascript to be precise)
[06:11] bickie: what's the usual approach for handling this?
[06:11] tlrobinson: Marak: small transactions take awhile though i think so who knows when it will actually show up
[06:12] mscdex: bickie: right, and node does set errno and code properties in a lot of cases, but i'm not sure about 'error' event errors
[06:12] Marak: tlrobinson: i see it now actually, just takes a while to crunch as valid
[06:12] azeroth____ has joined the channel
[06:12] tlrobinson: oh ok
[06:12] bickie: aah, ok
[06:12] bickie: so errno and code are the convention?
[06:12] mscdex: errno is errno from C-land
[06:12] mscdex: i can't remember what the code property is from
[06:13] ryah: tlrobinson: yes, binary can be used with readFileSync
[06:14] mscdex: bickie: in js you can have a subclass if you inherit the prototype, such as with util.inherits
[06:14] bickie: yer
[06:14] aaronblohowiak: SubStack:  base being an array doesn't seem to be working in package.json
[06:14] bickie: just trying to work out what the "node way" of doing things is
[06:14] bickie: just looked at node.io
[06:14] bickie: and they just return http error codes as integers for errors
[06:14] bickie: (skip the Error class entirely)
[06:14] bickie: which seems odd
[06:14] dominictarr has joined the channel
[06:15] jmoyers: is there a decent way to splice socket.io into express routes?
[06:15] tlrobinson: ryah: got it working if i leave out the encoding, but typeof require("fs").readFileSync(path, "binary") == "string"
[06:15] jmoyers: it would be nice to be able to use the same handlers
[06:15] jmoyers: and potentially parts of middleware
[06:15] ryah: tlrobinson: it's faster just get a buffer by leaving out the encoding
[06:15] briznad has joined the channel
[06:16] mscdex: bickie: so how does node.io handle 'error' events on the request then?
[06:16] dominictarr: is it possible to have npm 1 install dependencies locally, but as sym links to a cache (instead of recompiling, etc all deps?)
[06:16] bickie: mscdex: they kinda don't (they just pass up the error number)
[06:16] bickie: which means you lose any returned content too
[06:16] mscdex: what error number?
[06:17] ryankirkman has joined the channel
[06:17] bickie: or server generated error messages
[06:17] bickie: http error code
[06:17] bickie: they pass it up as an integer to the callback
[06:17] mscdex: you won't get that from the 'error' event though
[06:17] bickie: throw everything else out
[06:17] mscdex: that's an http error
[06:17] bickie: and do away with Error objects entirely
[06:17] bickie: yep
[06:17] jacobolus has joined the channel
[06:17] bickie: they just throw the whole lot out
[06:17] bickie: and call the callback with err populated as an integer
[06:17] bickie: seems very crude
[06:17] mscdex: 'error' event errors occur under the http layer
[06:18] bickie: aah, i see what you mean
[06:18] bickie: umm
[06:18] Guest9038: mscdex, how about this one:_https://github.com/substack/node-hashish
[06:18] mscdex: like if the remote end closed the connection unexpectedly
[06:18] mscdex: things like that
[06:19] mscdex: or some system error
[06:20] mscdex: Guest9038: that's just sugar on top of an object, no pushing or popping
[06:20] bickie: mscdex: https://github.com/chriso/node.io/blob/master/lib/node.io/request.js#L411
[06:20] bickie: handy
[06:20] bickie: so internal node errors
[06:20] Guest9038: yup, i see that ...woop ...-_-
[06:20] bickie: do have a errno attribute
[06:20] mscdex: bickie: pretty much yeah
[06:20] bickie: I wonder what else they have
[06:20] Adman65 has joined the channel
[06:20] superjudge has joined the channel
[06:21] mscdex: bickie: not much else, but errno will give you at least some idea what went wrong
[06:21] bickie: yeah, definitely seems to be the convention for internal errors
[06:22] bickie: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.3.1/api/dns.html mentions it too
[06:22] bickie: (see under dns.resolve)

[06:29] pradeepto: How does a node module like node-jshint work? Once installed globally, I can run jshint from commandline. Does it mean, it invokes node.js and then runs the jshint over the javascript file?

[06:29] aaronblohowiak: pradeepto: https://github.com/jshint/node-jshint/blob/master/bin/hint
[06:30] aaronblohowiak: yep. it envokes node in the current path and then it requires its cli module and calls a method on that module with the current arguments
[06:30] raidfive has joined the channel
[06:30] aaronblohowiak: this is the real implementation of the cli module, but the file i linked to above is the actual "command" 
[06:30] aaronblohowiak: https://github.com/jshint/node-jshint/blob/master/lib/cli.js

[06:31] DTrejo has joined the channel
[06:32] indexzero: When you set the 'bin' property in the package.json and install it with `-g` then npm puts symlinks to that script in your bin dir, usually /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin

[06:34] harth has joined the channel
[06:35] indutny: tlrobinson: AFAIK, readable stream should just have `pause` and `resume` methods, writeable stream should have `writable` attribute

[06:36] mscdex: if you are able to write to i

[06:54] chapel: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.7/api/child_processes.html#child_process.spawn
[06:54] chapel: With customFds it is possible to hook up the new process' [stdin, stout, stderr] to existing streams; -1 means that a new stream should be created.

[10:39] `3rdEden: as i'm the only one active int eh socket.io channel :p
[10:40] MaSch: i somewhere read about that socket.io is able to emit events "over the wire" so i call client.emit("costumevent") on the server and die client  does a socket.on("costumevent", function...); .. do you unterstand what i try to say? 
[10:41] `3rdEden: sure, you can build functionality like that, but it's not build in
[10:42] MaSch: okay, then it was just a dream :D thanks

[10:46] [AD]Turbo: are there any problems in sending unicode strings over socket.io ?
[10:46] MaSch: `3rdEden: thanks for the tips, does nowjs work with socket.io? 
[10:48] `3rdEden: [AD]Turbo socket.io just runs JSON.stringify over all your data, So i guess JSON will handle that for you.
[10:48] `3rdEden: MaSch nowjs uses Socket.IO under the hood

[12:03] johnnywengluu: is browserify production ready
[12:03] Remoun has joined the channel
[12:03] guybrush: they will get wrapped with some code, so you can `require` them on the client side
[12:03] johnnywengluu: do i have to have a nginx / caching in front of it?
[12:03] guybrush: johnnywengluu: yes i use it in production
[12:04] guybrush: browserify does cache all the code in memory
[12:04] jtsnow has joined the channel
[12:04] johnnywengluu: this is better than now.js?
[12:04] johnnywengluu: or is it for different needs
[12:04] guybrush: browserify and nowjs are 2 completely different things?!
[12:04] burningdog has joined the channel
[12:04] johnnywengluu: okay .. browserify works with npm modules
[12:05] johnnywengluu: now.js doesn't .. and it triggers code in server rather than fetching them to the client
[12:05] guybrush: did you read the README's of all those projects?
[12:05] johnnywengluu: yeah
[12:05] johnnywengluu: just wanted to make sure im correct
[12:05] johnnywengluu: well browserify it is then
[12:06] `3rdEden: tsesame and how do they make it easier to have clients communicate with each other?
[12:07] guybrush: johnnywengluu: browserify makes npm-modules REQUIRE-able on the client-side // nowjs makes functions CALL-able on the client-side
[12:07] tsesame: well you're not having to deal with serializing your data for the stream, they use objects to make remote method calls
[12:07] guybrush: maybe that is confusing?
[12:08] tsesame: NowJS has the everyone object to broadcast a method call to every client
[12:10] guybrush: johnnywengluu: also note that dnode comes with browserify
[12:10] `3rdEden: tsesame you can just send objects over socket.io as well.
[12:10] `3rdEden: tsesame socket.io has .broadcast as well..
[12:10] tsesame: sure, but then you have to somehow wait for them on the other side
[12:11] roidrage has joined the channel
[12:11] `3rdEden: errmm thats the same with dnode and nowjs?
[12:11] guybrush: `3rdEden: what is the purpose of underscore? why is "everyone" using it? --- i mean you can do it all with javascript
[12:11] `3rdEden: guybrush huh?
[12:11] tsesame: well, at least in the case of nowjs, you defined a method that would get called on the server when you call it on the client
[12:12] guybrush: `3rdEden: its the same with nowjs,dnode,.. everyone uses it --- even if you can do it yourself with socketio
[12:12] tsesame: it just simplifies things, that's all, less overhead to deal with
[12:13] guybrush: i mean, why do you even use socketio? you could write your own :p
[12:13] tsesame: as with anything, it's not necessarily the one solution to all -- in some cases you might want to roll your own RPC lib on top of socket.io
[12:13] `3rdEden: guybrush iknow but thats not the point here, tsesame stated that it easier to `connect` clients with other with nowjs and dnode. And I just want to know how it's easier than using socket.io
[12:14] `3rdEden: because you can just do client.on('message', function(data){ }socket[data.sessionid].send( data.message) | ) in socket.io and you have communication between 2 clients
[12:14] guybrush: `3rdEden: the dnode-slides from nodeconf explain that pretty well http://substack.net/doc/dnode_slides_nodeconf.pdf
[12:14] tsesame: Well I can't say I've written anything that uses socket.io directly, but I'd bet that it would take less LOC to write a basic chat server w/ NowJS than using socket.io alone
[12:15] guybrush: also note that there are dnode-protocol implementations in other languages too! so this becomes even more handy
[12:16] tsesame: `3rdEden: In your opinion, you don't think these libraries really add anything on top of socket.io?
[12:16] `3rdEden: guybrush iknow dnode works and how nowjs work.. but as i stated above, just because you can RPC it doesn't mean its `easier` to to have 2 users communicate with each other
[12:16] `3rdEden: tsesame thats not what I'm saying
[12:16] guybrush: `3rdEden: sorry maybe i dont get the point
[12:16] benmonty has joined the channel
[12:17] guybrush: i mean it is obviously why one would use wrapper-libs of socketio
[12:18] `3rdEden: Yes that is obviouse but it's not obviouse why you should do that if you just want to have 2 users communicate with other
[12:18] guybrush: right
[12:19] tsesame: We're talking about two clients communicating w/ each other via the server, right?
[12:19] `3rdEden: Yes, like personal messages
[12:20] hwinkel has joined the channel
[12:20] tsesame: So you're saying you can write the same functionality using just socket.io, in the same or less LOC?
[12:20] guybrush: `3rdEden: i use dnode because all my code is written to work with it :p
[12:20] mitko has joined the channel
[12:20] guybrush: and thats even rpc without socketio
[12:21] guybrush: plain tls-server/client communication wrapped with dnode
[12:21] tsesame: dnode doesn't use socket.io?
[12:21] tsesame: I had thought it did..
[12:21] guybrush: it does, to make server<->browser communication possible
[12:21] tsesame: oh gotcha

[12:25] tsesame: `3rdEden: Lol, if you want it to be.. I swear that I'm curious because if so I would seriously consider using socket.io directly

[12:29] fumanchu182 has joined the channel
[12:29] `3rdEden: tsesame socket.io already keeps a hash of all connect clients. They are stored as key (sessionid) > value (socket.io client obj)
[12:29] `3rdEden: So the only thing you would have to do, is send over a sessionid of the connected user, and a message

[12:36] guybrush: tsesame: i have also written a very simple example to use backbone and dnode for rpc (https://github.com/guybrush/backbone-rpc-example -- http://guybrush.no.de)
[12:36] johnnywengluu: guybrush: good explanation!
[12:37] dnolen has joined the channel
[12:38] johnnywengluu: guybrush: DNode is an asynchronous object-oriented RPC system for node.js that lets you call remote functions.
[12:38] johnnywengluu: so dnode is comparable with now.js?
[12:38] guybrush: it is
[12:39] johnnywengluu: dnode comes with browserify you said. if i just want to require npm modules .. i dont have to care about dnode?
[12:39] guybrush: yes
[12:39] johnnywengluu: why does it comes with browserify?
[12:39] johnnywengluu: come
[12:39] guybrush: to give you more ways to implement it
[12:39] jano has joined the channel
[12:40] guybrush: so if you just want to use dnode, require it on the serverside and it will mount /dnode.js for you
[12:40] `3rdEden: tsesame sessions are required for polling connections such as long polling
[12:40] guybrush: if you want to use some other npm-libs on the client too, you CAN use browserify and include dnode 
[12:41] johnnywengluu: okay 
[12:41] johnnywengluu: im not sure im getting this .. let me start with browserify first =)

[12:41] VovaZaycev has joined the channel
[12:41] johnnywengluu: can i use browserify to require from node.js server that isn't on the same ip as the javascript page?
[12:42] johnnywengluu: with other words : the browser file isn't served with node.js
[12:42] johnnywengluu: it still works?
[12:42] guybrush: johnnywengluu: hmm i think i dont quite get your question
[12:43] guybrush: xhr is not possible with browserify if thats what you mean
[12:43] johnnywengluu: the html/js is hosted on CDN
[12:43] johnnywengluu: and then i run a node.js server else where .. does it still work?
[12:43] guybrush: ok
[12:44] jesusabdullah: It doesn't do anything special in terms of loading the file on the client side, johnnywengluu. It just bundles everything for you on the server side.
[12:44] guybrush: you would have to fetch the js-code first, than bundle it with browserify
[12:44] johnnywengluu: okay
[12:44] johnnywengluu: seems to be a very popular way of require() npm modules
[12:44] johnnywengluu: a lot of users
[12:44] RC1140 has joined the channel
[12:45] johnnywengluu: kinda a good hack =)
[12:45] guybrush: i think, what you want to do is call browserify via dnode and bundle code from any CDN? :D
[12:46] johnnywengluu: hmm
[12:46] tsesame: `3rdEden: That makes sense now
[12:46] johnnywengluu: i have to idea what i want
[12:46] kriszyp has joined the channel
[12:46] guybrush: johnnywengluu: just try to implement some basic examples yourself, you will get how it works
[12:46] johnnywengluu: just wondered if it can fetch my npm packages from a node.js server that isn't serving the html file
[12:46] tsesame: I can see that using socket.io is simpler than I had thought
[12:46] tsesame: for some cases anyway
[12:47] johnnywengluu: the html file is served from a cdn
[12:47] johnnywengluu: okay
[12:47] vikstrous has joined the channel
[12:48] guybrush: johnnywengluu: i think you would have to put <script src="nodeserver/browserify.js"> into your html which is on the CDN
[12:48] johnnywengluu: yeah
[12:48] guybrush: and in the server.js you will bundle all the stuff from npm you want to
[12:48] johnnywengluu: of course .. then i fetch the npm packages from the browserify node.js server on another location
[12:49] tsesame: guybrush:  Have you used mongoose before?  Do you know if one can extend backbone's model all the way back to into mongodb using it so as to make it persistent?
[12:49] guybrush: tsesame: didnt use mongoose yet, but it must be possible for sure
[12:50] tsesame: that would be phenomenal 
[12:50] guybrush: the backbone-rpc-example ihve written uses a memory-store
[12:50] johnnywengluu: tsesame: watch a rails 2011 presentation
[12:50] guybrush: just replace it with mongoose
[12:50] johnnywengluu: its about "not using ORMs"
[12:50] `3rdEden: tsesame yes, thats why I asked why nowjs or dnode where better at it. :9

[12:53] tsesame: So, as far inter-node communication, is dnode the way to go?
[12:53] tsesame: as far as*
[12:53] guybrush: tsesame: its all about opinions

[12:57] jesusabdullah: such as some REST protocol, or something like this
[12:57] jesusabdullah: You could do that too

[13:34] pigmej: i will try it..
[13:34] pigmej: maybe i can manage something with it..
[13:35] mscdex: or maybe try setting 'agent' to false in your http.request() options object
[13:35] mscdex: that will create a new agent for each request
[13:35] pigmej: yup i read it somewhere in the net ..
[13:36] pigmej: i need to check
[13:36] pigmej: maybe node has some 'magic'
[13:36] pigmej: and it automatically creates more requests
[13:36] pigmej: when it's needed:)
[13:37] mscdex: you can also change the maximum number of sockets used by changing http.Agent.defaultMaxSockets (default is 5)

[14:32] Wizek: shimondoodkin, Try `const foo = 1` then :)
[14:32] andyl: shimondoodkin: npm install checks the variable 'skipclean' before running the interactive, but I can't figure out how to set that variable from the command-line...

[14:32] shimondoodkin: before the command

[16:29] ss23: So, I'm messing with nodejs, and thouht I would try an IRC bot (something simple, but just because my JS isn't very strong), however, the following code seems to act like none of my .writes happen.
[16:29] ss23: Their callbacks all trigger (if I put a console.log('foo') for them, that is), but it seems the server never receives them. In any case, nothing happens (nothign recieved) until it finally disconnects. https://gist.github.com/983221
[16:29] [algo]: how to add my module to https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules ?

[16:30] FredFred has joined the channel
[16:30] AvianFlu: ss23: there's a node-irc module on npm that's pretty solid
[16:30] AvianFlu: if you want to mess with it at a higher level
[16:30] ss23: I'm not too fussed on what I work with for now, so just trying this, but I might check it out later
[16:30] ss23: Any thoughts on the issue though? As far as I can see, from looking at other examples even, the code *should* be fine
[16:31] ss23: So not sure if it's a deeper problem or what's going on :S
[16:32] AvianFlu: it might be that the event you're waiting for is too simple, ss23
[16:33] ss23: Hmm? What do you mean?
[16:33] AvianFlu: cause one tends to receive all sorts of stuff from an IRC server before one can actually send commands
[16:33] AvianFlu: my first thought is that you might see "found your hostname..." and try to send data back, the server just won't care
[16:33] ss23: I've tried with a timer and noting that it's sent after it's ready for auth
[16:34] CiRlE has joined the channel
[16:34] ss23: And I believe (although I may be wrong), the IRC server will 'stack' the commands it receives while working, if that makes sense
[16:34] AvianFlu: yeah I don't know the IRC server internals
[16:34] AvianFlu: but you could try setting up a dummy socket listener to connect to
[16:34] AvianFlu: see if your messages are getting sent at all
[16:34] ss23: Hmm, might try that, good idea
[16:35] ryah: tjh: are the tests for that online?
[16:35] tjgillies: or run your own irc server to test
[16:35] AvianFlu: the reason I mentioned node-irc so fast is that writing socket code tends to have its own set of problems
[16:35] tjgillies: theres a good one written in node
[16:35] AvianFlu: tjgillies: also a great idea
[16:35] tjh: ryah: no stand-alone test but connect's were the ones failing
[16:35] ss23: tjgillies: I do run my own IRC server, but I don't want to run it in debug mode just to check this
[16:35] ss23: I'll just conect it to a different socket I can monitor
[16:36] ryah: tjh: how do i run connects test? install connect "make test" ?
[16:36] tjgillies: ss23: well, then thats your problem ;)

[16:44] tjh: Tobsn i dont get it
[16:44] Tobsn: damnit.
[16:44] tjh: so both are parallel?
[16:44] ss23: I'm not sure how this works... but it looks like I need to send newline characters after each .write... ;_;
[16:44] Tobsn: well i guess
[16:44] Tobsn: must be

[16:47] ss23: Yeah, once I realised that it was actually sending the data, knew I had to search somewhere else
[16:47] johnnywengluu: hmm 
[16:47] johnnywengluu: if im using Browserify .. will the 'event' module work on the browser you think?
[16:48] Tobsn: okay, now this makes sense. 4 requests with node.js = 800ms (which means the longest reponse time takes 800ms) vs. 3 seconds in php.
[16:48] duncanbeevers: johnnywengluu: Seems like a good candidate. Let us know what you find.
[16:48] johnnywengluu: okay .. ill get back

[16:48] johnnywengluu: ah 
[16:49] johnnywengluu: then i guess ill pass .. hate hacking =)

[17:47] drudge: killfill: right, store the client.sessionId in the session so you can get it

[17:49] chjj: just anything but javascript or ecmascript, those names are both terrible in every way

[18:03] orospakr: Hi!  What's the story with npm 1.x and system-wide installs of modules?  Very confusingly, sudo npm install xxxx on some of my machines will properly install the modules into /usr/local, but on some machines, it puts them into roots home directory!
[18:03] orospakr: While I do find npm's ability to install things into your homedir handy, most often I want to do system-wide installs.
[18:04] orospakr: vexingly, the documentation doesn't seem to talk this difference much.

[18:10] olalonde: orospakr: not talking about -g in npm -h

[18:11] olalonde: ;)
[18:11] orospakr: heh, I assume you mean the latter.
[18:11] orospakr: I actually kind of like the idea, so long as its an optional thing.  I just wish that npm better warned me of it.
[18:11] olalonde: yep
[18:11] orospakr: still, npm is much better now than it was.
[18:12] orospakr: actually, I guess there ought to be three modes: a) global b) homedir c) local to project (.node_modules)
[18:12] orospakr: the b) behaviour was how it worked before
[18:12] context: the way npm 1.0 handles packages makes more sense. i use to hate it. isaac's explained it really well though
[18:12] orospakr: does b) still exist at all?
[18:12] hunterloftis: tjh - I keep forgetting how stylus does the src/dest params - this gist doesn't seem to be able to map the .styl files to .css files (.css just goes to a 404): https://gist.github.com/983454
[18:12] darshanshankar: with npm update - does it update if content changes or if the version number changes?
[18:13] context: uhh. if what you depend on changes.
[18:13] context: im going to guess....
[18:13] context: and content should not be changing if the version number doesn't
[18:13] tjh: hunterloftis it just takes the pathname and plops it on both of those paths

[18:14] chjj: i do that all the time
[18:14] hunterloftis: tjh: the __dirname?
[18:14] chjj: but its usually after i publish for the first time
[18:14] tjh: hunterloftis if you have static() exposing ./public GET /styles/foo.css
[18:14] tjh: should work

[18:14] tjh: hunterloftis: the pathname from the request
[18:14] orospakr: olalonde, wait, what the heck? when I did sudo npm install -g, npm *did* put a copy of all those modules into ~/.npm/ (that is, the homedir of the user I sudo'd *from*)
[18:14] tjh: url
[18:15] hunterloftis: tjh: gotcha
[18:15] orospakr: as well as installing them into /usr/local
[18:15] orospakr: does it consider that its scratchspace area for doing the tests and whatnot?
[18:15] orospakr: and nothing is actually ever loaded from ~/.npm/ ?
[18:15] orospakr: maybe /tmp would have been more appropriate, if so?
[18:15] tjh: hunterloftis it's so simple that it's confusing
[18:16] tjh: confuses me too
[18:16] tjh: haha

[19:08] frostbytten: context: I'm not worried about stack, just presenting pretty errors at this point. I believe that what you are saying is that because it's an anon function it does't fall under the  try-catch-finally called above it( except the finally always runs)
[19:11] mnutt has joined the channel
[19:11] KilljoyCorry: frostbytten: you can only understand exceptions in terms of the stack.  When you throw the stack is unwound one invocation at a time, looking for catch clauses.  If the function with the try-catch is no longer on the tack because it returned then it can't catch anything
[19:11] KilljoyCorry: Whether or not the function is anonymous is not relevant.
[19:12] frostbytten: right... I get it now. 
[19:12] frostbytten: So it would be nested hell then.
[19:12] frostbytten: I have an idea then... a callbackable error if it's safe
[19:13] frostbytten: Okay... thanks!
[19:13] frostbytten: :D
[19:13] frostbytten: and use app.error for everything else (using express/connect)
[19:14] frostbytten: And the safety catch at the bottom of process.on('uncaughException')
[19:15] shimondoodkin: frostbytten: it will catch db or db.open not exist , all others are inside the callback of db.open

[19:34] olalonde: mikey_p: what are you trying to achieve?
[19:34] frostbytten: Because, according to what I underdstand (ish) once inside another functions (a callback) and the stack changes over, all the modules that in their docs say, throw Error('something')  what capturs it
[19:34] mikegerwitz: frostbytten: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.7/api/events.html the idea is to emit an 'error' event. This event can be listened to by callers and bubbled up by them artifically. Then, if nothing is listening on 'error', it will process.emit( 'uncaughtException' ). If that's not handled, it'll print a stack trace and exit

[19:34] aaronblohowiak: mscdex: you were an inspiration to google harder
[19:34] mscdex: aaronblohowiak: yeah i was just about to paste that :)
[19:34] mikey_p: olalonde: I want to return the result from the mongoose query when the arg to get() is called
[19:35] mscdex: that one is on the modules list too ;)
[19:35] frostbytten: mikegerwitz
[19:35] frostbytten: thanks
[19:35] mikegerwitz: frostbytten: If you're using an async function, you're right, nothing catches exceptions unles there's a try/catch block within that stack. If not, uncaughtException is once again raised
[19:35] mikegerwitz: emitted*
[19:35] olalonde: mikey_p: you can't really use returns with callbacks afaik
[19:35] truedat101 has joined the channel
[19:35] aaronblohowiak: mscdex: oooh, it does an unsync on existing directories, not a merge. boooooo.
[19:36] mscdex: huh?
[19:36] aaronblohowiak: mscdex: it doesn't copy-merge. it copy-overwrites
[19:36] jacobolus has joined the channel
[19:36] olalonde: mikey_p: it would help to see the rest of the code
[19:36] mikey_p: olalonde: any idea how I could restructure that code to achieve the same effect?
[19:36] Venom_X has joined the channel
[19:36] frostbytten: mikegerwitz: I was thinking that was right. I see all these libraries using throw new Error() [looking at Express for example, in their error handling] and their errorlistener isn't catching them
[19:36] tmedema has joined the channel
[19:36] mscdex: well, that's easily changeable
[19:36] olalonde: mikey_p: does the code "continue" below?
[19:37] mikegerwitz: frostbytten: yep, unfortunately not
[19:37] mikey_p: olalonde: that's pretty much it. here's the whole module: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/392428/
[19:38] frostbytten: because it's app.on and in this case (if you've seen my example) the error listener would need to be db.on
[19:38] frostbytten: mikegerwitz: ^^
[19:39] mikegerwitz: frostbytten: ah I didn't see your example. I just started readnig a few min ago
[19:39] aaronblohowiak: fuck it, users should be using version control anyway =)
[19:39] frostbytten: https://gist.github.com/983546
[19:40] olalonde: mikey_p: not sure I get what you are trying to do, I never used mongoose, but maybe this can give an idea: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/lehr4ur5RK1t3UYEhZmF/
[19:40] frostbytten: mikegerwitz: and everything underneath that would need to have it's own .on('error'); wow

[19:44] mikegerwitz: frostbytten: I'm not sure if anyone has come up with a more elegant solution. I don't usually bubble, so my advice is limited.
[19:44] frostbytten: mikegerwitz: I guess that means a whole crapload of if-blocks
[19:44] steffan has joined the channel
[19:45] olalonde: mikey_p: return notebook; <-- where do you want to catch this return?
[19:45] frostbytten: That means reference errors will always cause a whitepage because there is no reference to res (in Express/Connect)
[19:45] frostbytten: And hang as well
[19:45] frostbytten: Nice
[19:45] frostbytten: Well... not really.
[19:45] tjh: frostbytten that's the nature of node
[19:46] olalonde: im looking up the mongoose doc 2 secs
[19:46] tjh: you have to be careful
[19:46] mikegerwitz: frostbytten: well, if there's ReferenceErrors, that's a bigger issue ;)
[19:46] mikey_p: olalonde: in the outer function, the one that is passed as the first argument to get(), that function has to return a value from what I can tell
[19:46] frostbytten: Yeah... I agree.
[19:46] mikey_p: olalonde: http://mongoosejs.com/docs/virtuals.html
[19:46] frostbytten: Trying to be... lots of defensive coding.

[19:50] postwait: how do I setup an install in the package.json when I don't have any javascript files?
[19:50] aaronblohowiak: flazz npm 1.0 changed a lot =)
[19:50] mikey_p: FireFly: yes, it's changed
[19:50] postwait: (my module is all C++), compiles to a .node file
[19:50] mikey_p: flazz: use npm -g to install global now
[19:50] FireFly: flazz*
[19:51] olalonde: mikey_p: I believe the function has already returned when the findById callback is called so there's no way really to use it to return stuff
[19:52] flazz: so when would i want non-global installation? is it meant to be per project?
[19:52] mikey_p: olalonde: yeah, i feel like there's gotta be some way to restructure this, I just don't know what it is
[19:52] mikey_p: flazz: yeah
[19:52] Hamms has joined the channel
[19:52] mikey_p: it's helpful when modules are updating alot and projects have specific dependencies

[19:53] tayy has joined the channel
[19:54] olalonde: mikey_p: probably, but not with .get() I believe
[19:55] olalonde: afaik if you want to return a value from .get() it cant depend on async calls
[19:55] mikey_p: i feel like all I need to do is make a function that blocks on an async call, and then specify that as the callback in get, but I don't know how to do that

[19:57] aaronblohowiak: eirikb: why would ou want that?
[19:57] aaronblohowiak: eirikb: arguments.callee.caller
[19:57] eirikb: aaronblohowiak: I have a addListener, and then I eventually want to clean that up automatically, based on the module that called it
[19:57] mikegerwitz: eirikb: Yes, but it's removed in strict mode. Not recommended
[19:58] aaronblohowiak: mikegerwitz: if "with" was still in strict mode, then i would use strict mode
[19:58] aaronblohowiak: =)
[19:58] eirikb: aaronblohowiak: Nice, thanks

[23:02] jmoyers: no asyncronous getters
[23:02] jmoyers: not the nature of node
[23:02] tanepiper: damn, apparently i'm only the second swearyist twitter for nodejs
[23:02] jmoyers: you probably want an embedded document instead?
[23:03] tanepiper: *twitterer?, twitterist? twatist?
[23:03] mikey_p: wait, what if I did a post('init') middleware that set a virtual property?
[23:04] mikey_p: jmoyers: too many embedded documents to be practical
[23:04] jmoyers: doesn't make sense to me
[23:04] jmoyers: to do some init function to build an object up

[23:09] mikey_p: i know that's technically possible, but it just doesn't seems like the right tool for the job, mongo's documentation recommends using DBref

[23:13] jmoyers: you're not going to want to join a 5k row query onto another object just for fun
[23:14] jmoyers: you'd do it lazily, or move the logic up one layer and have a data service of some kind to issue the bulk query

[23:29] mjr_: hey ryah, I'm getting some uncatchable errors on clients as well, I just noticed.
[23:30] ryah: mjr_: oh really?
[23:30] mjr_: Now that I've worked around most of the server issues, I noticed that clients are getting a similar thing.
[23:30] ryah: mjr_: what do those look like?
[23:30] levi501d has joined the channel
[23:30] ryah: how often do they happen?

[23:31] rauchg has joined the channel
[23:31] mjr_: I suppose it's possible that I botched an error handler in there somewhere
[23:31] ryah: how often are you doing outbound clients?
[23:31] mjr_: oh, often
[23:31] mjr_: each incoming request from a user might make several outgoing requests to different services.

[23:32] ryah: well this is a new data point
[23:32] mjr_: thing is, the only nodes that crash with this are ones that connect to Facebook.  Thus, I immediately suspect https client.

[23:34] mjr_: Maybe 25/sec outgoing https.
[23:34] pquerna: anyone know of a drop-dead simple pubsub server in node.js?  Not looking for something to communciate with browser clients, just peer-node processes, without having to pull in redis or amqp-world
[23:35] pquerna: (i suspect the answer will be just use redis)
[23:35] mjr_: speaking in very rough numbers without actually looking at the graphs.
[23:35] fcambus: ryah : sure, feel free to use it for whatever purpose it might serve :)
[23:35] tjholowaychuk: jTNT ? fix them if you find a bug lol or at least report a bug
[23:35] tjholowaychuk: jerrysv checking it out
[23:35] Epeli: pquerna:  dnode
[23:36] ryah: the parser i did for node-amqp could be adapted in short order for building a server
[23:36] jerrysv: tjholowaychuck: we reproduced that with 0.11 and 0.12
[23:36] ryah: of course it's an awful protocol and we shouldn't support it
[23:36] tjholowaychuk: jerrysv that missing td?
[23:36] tjholowaychuk: very weird :s
[23:36] jerrysv: yup :) very
[23:36] pquerna: Epeli: ah, didn'tknow dnode did node<->node, thought it was always browser involved.
[23:36] tjholowaychuk: i'll look into it

[23:37] tjholowaychuk: jerrysv yeah sure

[23:37] tjholowaychuk: jerrysv interesting, even with most of that gone it still happens
[23:37] tjholowaychuk: something funky going on
[23:37] dyer has joined the channel
[23:37] dyer has joined the channel
[23:38] mjr_: ryah: net.js:718 does a require('dns') for every connect.  Doesn't that end up doing some filesystem op like a stat or something?
[23:38] jerrysv: tjholowaychuck: yup. and not parliament funky either
[23:38] mjr_: Or am I misreading this?
[23:38] SubStack: pquerna: yeah lots of people don't realize that
[23:38] SubStack: even though that's what I mostly use it for
[23:38] jhurliman: my understanding is that require() only loads/compiles code from the filesystem on the first call, and caches the result
[23:39] SubStack: pquerna: http://substack.net/posts/9bac3e/Roll-your-own-PubSub-with-DNode
[23:39] SubStack: just ignore the last part about getting it running in the browser
[23:39] mjr_: still, surely the call to require for every new connection is slower than keeping a reference to it somewhere in that file.
[23:39] jhurliman: mjr_, so it would be more expensive than assigning it to a local var and referencing that (at a minimum there would have to be some sort of hashtable lookup), but not nearly as bad as hitting the filesystem each time
[23:40] jmoyers: mjr_: there is a module cache system
[23:40] ryah: mjr_: no, i don't think there is a stat
[23:40] ryah: mjr_: why?
[23:40] mjr_: I know there's a cache.  I seem to recall isaacs saying that there was.
[23:40] jaket has joined the channel
[23:40] isaacs: what is this i'm sahying now?
[23:40] ryah: mjr_: not at our layer - i'm sure c-ares has a cache
[23:41] mjr_: isaacs: I just noticed that Socket.prototype.connect() does require('dns').lookup() for every new connection
[23:41] isaacs: mjr_: oh, ok
[23:41] mjr_: Isn't there some kind of overhead with calling require every time?
[23:41] isaacs: i dunno about the .lookup() part, but require("dns") is trivial
[23:41] ryah: mjr_: require is cheap
[23:41] isaacs: mjr_: for internal modules, it's as cheap as a v8 function call and object member lookup
[23:42] mjr_: oh good
[23:42] isaacs: for external modules, it's slightly more expensive.
[23:42] meetar has joined the channel
[23:42] mjr_: I see.  I knew there was something worth avoiding in there.
[23:42] isaacs: depending on how hard it is to figure out what file you mean.  require("./foo.js") is probably faster than require("foo")
[23:42] avalanche123 has joined the channel
[23:43] isaacs: but even still, really just the first time is the hit.  require() caches pretty aggressively
[23:43] jhurliman: isaacs, wouldn't that only be the first call? afterward it should know that "foo" == some_cached_module
[23:43] isaacs: jhurliman: it depends on where you're calling it *from* though
[23:43] jhurliman: hm
[23:43] mjr_: So ryah if I dump "this" at net.js:601, will I get the ip/port it was trying to connect to?
[23:43] isaacs: jhurliman: but even that, it's just looping through an array of things, and if one of them has already been where the module was found, then ti'll return the cached one
