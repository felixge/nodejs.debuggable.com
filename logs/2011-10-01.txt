[00:31] navaru: If there's a module on npm that is not maintained anymore, and I've wrote anotherone but I kinda' need the name of the unmaintained one, how should I handle this?
[00:31] isaacs: navaru: email the author and work it out
[00:31] isaacs: why do you need that name?
[00:31] isaacs: that's liable to cause problems if any modules are depending on it
[00:32] navaru: it's for the extension chrome/firefox livereload, so changing the name won't be very useful
[00:33] isaacs: navaru: whenever possible, i try to let module authors settle this on their own
[00:33] navaru: ok, i've emailed the original author
[00:33] navaru: thank you :)
[00:33] isaacs: navaru: if the author does not respond at all, and your thing is an update to that thing, or fixes some bugs, but is the "same" module, then i'll usually eventually intervene and add you as a maintainer

[05:20] AAA_awright: shanebo: NODE_PATH
[05:20] Aikar: ^, doing it at runtime is 'unsupported' (but possible)
[05:21] aho: require also works with relative paths though
[05:21] shanebo: how do npm required modules know where to look?
[05:21] Aikar: node looks in node_modules
[05:22] isaacs: shanebo: npm help folders, and also: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.5.8/api/modules.html
[05:22] shanebo: and when you install npm, npm tells node where node_modules is?
[05:22] Aikar: no, nde_modules is a magic dir in node itself
[05:22] isaacs: shanebo: no, npm is not involved in loading modules, only putting them there
[05:22] isaacs: shanebo: npm help folders
[05:22] Aikar: has nothing to do with npm, npm just installs there
[05:22] isaacs: run that^

[05:24] FMJaggy has joined the channel
[05:25] shanebo: isaacs, I'm unclear how to resolve my path issue though
[05:26] shanebo: locally I have node_modules in my home directory. my node projects are elsewhere and the require(foo-node-mod) works fine
[05:26] isaacs: shanebo: are they somewhere else under your home dir?  it walks up the folder path
[05:26] Peniar has joined the channel
[05:26] isaacs: shanebo: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.5.8/api/modules.html
[05:26] isaacs: as described there^
[05:27] shanebo: however on my linode linux box if node_modules aren't in the same directory as the node project, it can't find them
[05:27] shanebo: isaacs, yes
[05:27] isaacs: shanebo: if it's a child folder, then it'll work
[05:27] shanebo: I want node_modules one up from my node projects
[05:28] shanebo: so:
[05:28] shanebo: '/home/node_modules/'
[05:28] isaacs: shanebo: why not just use it the way it's designed to be used, and install your deps locally?
[05:28] isaacs: shanebo: cd my-project; npm install
[05:28] shanebo: '/home/sites/foo_project/'
[05:28] sdwrage has joined the channel
[05:29] shanebo: isaacs locally per project?
[05:29] isaacs: shanebo: sure
[05:29] metellus has joined the channel
[05:29] shanebo: You're recommending that or saying that's possible?
[05:30] shanebo: because I tend to not want to repeat myself and keep all modules in one place and require each as needed per project
[05:30] shanebo: but maybe that's not what you had in mind in npm?
[05:31] konobi: disk space is cheap
[05:32] shanebo: konobi, agreed, but having node_modules in every project is redundant. Especially considering most devs use the same modules almost every project. Unless I'm unaware of technical issues requiring deps from one place?
[05:32] grahammelcher has joined the channel
[05:33] shanebo: what am I missing isaacs?
[05:33] konobi: versions changes, apis change... you going to update every one of your projects each time one of your dependencies?
[05:33] shanebo: konobi, that tends to be how I roll
[05:34] isaacs: shanebo: so, either install everything locally (totally fine) or use the `npm link` command if you prefer (also fine, not supported on windows)
[05:34] shanebo: or in more of a ruby environment you'd point to which version
[05:34] isaacs: shanebo: or, use a higher-level node_modules folder, and install stuff there.
[05:35] isaacs: in production, i highly recommend local installs.
[05:35] mAritz has joined the channel
[05:35] isaacs: it's a little redundant, but it's also clear and you don't change one thing when you mean to change another
[05:35] brainproxy: shanebo: the node_modules pattern, especially as faciliated by npm, fosters portability
[05:35] isaacs: ay
[05:35] isaacs: you probably don't have more than a few things running on a single vm/vps/zone anyway
[05:35] konobi: i do the same with perl apps, etc.
[05:35] brainproxy: it also help to avoid some of the brittle-ness that inevitably comes with globalized dependencies
[05:36] chovy has joined the channel
[05:36] isaacs: for local dev, i like to get things to break asap, so i do use a lot of links to global installs.
[05:36] chovy: Anyone know how to install this module?
[05:36] chovy: Cannot find module 'Socket.IO-node'
[05:36] isaacs: chovy: npm install socket.io
[05:36] shanebo: isaacs, if I use a higher level folder, I'd have to relative path all requires?
[05:36] chovy: isaacs: tried that, but i still get the error
[05:36] chovy: i'm trying to use node-boilerplate
[05:36] brainproxy: isaacs: know of any addons that are being dev'd with gyp?
[05:36] isaacs: chovy: "the error" <-- i'm not familiar with that one.
[05:37] isaacs: brainproxy: nope
[05:37] brainproxy: i mean, that are using gyp instead of waf
[05:37] brainproxy: ok
[05:37] isaacs: brainproxy: i don't know of any
[05:37] isaacs: or how to do that, even :)
[05:37] isaacs: ryah probably does.
[05:37] brainproxy: lol, well i told my c++ guy to figure it out
[05:37] brainproxy: but then he asked me if there are examples
[05:38] chovy: isaacs: https://gist.github.com/148d891666e8f4e438f8
[05:38] isaacs: chovy: are you doing require('Socket.IO-node')?
[05:38] isaacs: chovy: it should be require('socket.io')
[05:38] chovy: ok
[05:40] shanebo: isaacs, see my higher level node_modules question?
[05:41] isaacs: shanebo: no, you would not have to use relative paths.
[05:41] isaacs: shanebo: read that modules doc.
[05:41] isaacs: it explains it in very explicit detail.  then has pseudocode.
[05:42] isaacs: seriously, i can't tell you better than to just keep posting this link: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.5.8/api/modules.html
[05:42] ph6 has joined the channel
[05:42] shanebo: isaacs and node 0.4.12 docs are the same in that respect?

[06:32] nforgerit has joined the channel
[06:32] deadman87: busy with anything exciting? 
[06:33] albertosh: yeah man
[06:33] albertosh: pixable.com
[06:33] deadman87: nice
[06:33] albertosh: hav you heard about it?
[06:33] melcher has joined the channel
[06:34] deadman87: nope... first time i'm hearing about it
[06:34] deadman87: does it use node.js?
[06:34] albertosh: im trying to decide whether to use it or not
[06:35] deadman87: well, give it a shot
[06:35] deadman87: if you dont like it, remove access to this app from ur facebook
[06:35] albertosh: which app?
[06:35] melcher has joined the channel
[06:36] deadman87: pixable
[06:36] deadman87: it links to ur facebook when u sign up
[06:36] cjheath has joined the channel
[06:36] deadman87: ohh wait a minute.. sorry 
[06:36] deadman87: u thinking about using node.js in pixable
[06:36] albertosh: yeah it uses fb connect
[06:36] albertosh: yeah
[06:37] deadman87: and yes, u can use node.js for alot of things in a site like that
[06:37] albertosh: example?
[06:38] joemccann has joined the channel
[06:38] deadman87: for starters, node.js is quite fast and can handle a huge number of concurrent connections. You could use node.js backend to pull data from facebook faster.
[06:38] Isaiah has joined the channel
[06:39] slifty has joined the channel
[06:39] albertosh: faster than php multithreaded?
[06:39] deadman87: not too sure.. but the general concensus is that it is much faster than php.
[06:40] melcher has joined the channel
[06:41] deadman87: also node.js' event-based architecture plays nice with long-polling requests.. so you could implement real-time updates without hammering the server
[06:42] albertosh: hmmm sounds interesting, why are they nice with long-polling req?
[06:43] albertosh: cause of the callbacks right?
[06:43] albertosh: makes sense...
[06:44] deadman87: in short, yes
[06:44] dominictarr has joined the channel
[06:44] deadman87: the server or thread doesnt block cos of that one request
[06:44] zackattack has joined the channel
[06:44] thalll has joined the channel
[06:44] deadman87: the server assigns the callback to the request and goes about doing other things.. when that callback fires, the server responds to the client
[06:45] melcher has joined the channel
[06:45] joemccann has joined the channel
[06:46] albertosh: but can fb do long-polling?
[06:46] albertosh: have you ever built something like this?
[06:46] deadman87: I have built a site that does long polling.. but not with facebook
[06:47] Nuck: Facebook has a shite API
[06:47] albertosh: what are you doing nowadays?
[06:47] albertosh: yes but full of info Nuck
[06:47] deadman87: I am busy with my degree and working/freelancing
[06:47] Nuck: albertosh: Yes, sweet nougaty info
[06:47] Nuck: If you can crack through the shell of shit
[06:48] albertosh: what do you mean?
[06:48] melcher has joined the channel
[06:49] albertosh: where r u located ? (if i may ask)
[06:49] melcher has joined the channel
[06:49] Nuck: albertosh: I'm in California
[06:49] deadman87: albertosh, here are some nice graphs/numbers comparing node.js with apache+php
[06:49] deadman87: http://zgadzaj.com/benchmarking-nodejs-basic-performance-tests-against-apache-php
[06:49] Nuck: And Facebook has a nasty, nasty API, from what I hear
[06:49] Nuck: IT's supposed to be the #1 most hated API on all the web
[06:49] c4milo has joined the channel
[06:49] albertosh: but its the #1 most used
[06:49] Nuck: And yes, Node.js is very, very fast.
[06:49] albertosh: and by a LOT
[06:50] Nuck: albertosh: Sure, on the web
[06:50] Nuck: Off the web, Twitter probably wins out
[06:50] melcher_ has joined the channel
[06:51] albertosh: well but those are only for hello world requests
[06:51] deadman87: Facebook API has been going through a ton of changes lately..
[06:51] albertosh: facebook itself changed DRASTICALLY last thursday
[06:52] deadman87: so I have been keeping away from developing for FB 
[06:52] Nuck: To do your own long-polling setup, you'd probably wanna hook onto a firehose
[06:52] Nuck: And AFAIK, Facebook lacks a firehose API, at least publicly
[06:53] albertosh: ok
[06:54] deadman87: well.. bottomline is that facebook has a ton of users
[06:54] deadman87: and if you can come up with something that taps into that userbase
[06:54] deadman87: u make money
[06:54] Nuck: That's not gauranteed
[06:54] Nuck: In fact, while you see a lot of successes, there's far more failures
[06:54] deadman87: of course
[06:55] deadman87: but you'll never know until u try 
[06:55] Nuck: deadman87: meh I've got better markets to tap
[06:55] Wraithan has left the channel

[06:57] Nuck: I'm not gonna because I'm busy tapping one right now ;)
[06:57] Nuck: You'll see when we go public
[06:57] albertosh: good luck with that my friend!
[06:58] deadman87: The mobile space has alot of potential in developing countries. At my old company we made some crappy apps (as per the client's request), which he marketed successfully and made it big

[07:01] Nuck: Android doesn't make that much money

[07:20] EhevuTov_: that's what I was looking for, thanks!
[07:21] japerry: happy late night coding.. =P looking for someone who might know a little bit about buffers... in C# a list (of type byte) can just push data onto the stack. I'd like to do the same, and was thinking perhaps a buffer (array) is right but not sure how to get the data in there
[07:21] japerry: I'm working with serialport trying to read bytes from a usb device
[07:21] EhevuTov_: so, is pump basically a way to keep the buffer from overflowing?
[07:21] EhevuTov_: japerry, is push() and pop() in javascript what you need?
[07:22] Nuck: doubt it
[07:22] Nuck: Are you dealing in binary, japerry?
[07:22] japerry: well thats what I was hoping, but nope. its a buffer not an array
[07:22] japerry: Hex
[07:22] Nuck: japerry: Well, how are you receiving data?
[07:22] konobi: open the device as an fd readable stream
[07:22] Nuck: What form?
[07:23] seawise has joined the channel
[07:23] japerry: yah, so okay let me elaborate, I'm using the serialport to do serialport.on('data', function(data) { buf.???(data); } );
[07:23] DoiDor: exit
[07:23] japerry: where ??? is in c# was bytelist.add .. not sure what to do here now..
[07:23] Nuck: >_>
[07:23] DoiDor has left the channel
[07:23] konobi: data is already a buffer
[07:23] melcher has joined the channel
[07:23] japerry: oh so just make an array and push them on
[07:24] Nuck: japerry: Do you want to get teh whole thing before continuing?
[07:24] Nuck: IF so, Node probably isn't the place for you :P

[07:24] Nuck: streaming is where it's at
[07:24] japerry: no, as its going in
[07:24] japerry: basically loop and grab the hex codes, and watch for ones that are important and do stuff(tm)
[07:25] melcher has joined the channel
[07:25] EhevuTov_: hrm, I wonder how you do the watching
[07:25] japerry: i have it within a setInterval loop which goes every 100ms
[07:25] Nuck: waitwhat
[07:25] japerry: and i just need what new data is in there
[07:25] konobi: te event will fire whenever
[07:26] japerry: i might have this totally wrong ... I am trying to adapt it from someone who abandoned a c# library
[07:26] `3rdEden has joined the channel
[07:26] EhevuTov_: there's prob a better way than to do a 100ms loop
[07:26] stagas: japerry: this might be useful https://github.com/bnoordhuis/node-buffertools
[07:26] japerry: yah, thats how c# did it.. looped every 100ms and read in the buffers
[07:26] Nuck: japerry: If you just need to check for a hex thing in a piece, then you can use bnoordhuis' buffertools library for the buffer.indexOf
[07:27] Nuck: japerry: Do you have a serial port lib yet?
[07:27] japerry: Nuck: yup I've been playing with that fairly successfully
[07:27] shimizu has joined the channel
[07:27] Nuck: Just remember that your "important" indicator may be split on the border of two chunks
[07:27] Nuck: japerry: Each time the data event fires, you get a new bit of the data
[07:27] tilgovi has joined the channel
[07:27] tilgovi has joined the channel
[07:27] japerry: heh got it to the point where I can read in the first bit of data... I put in a debug console.log(data) before the buffer command
[07:27] Nuck: It'll fire randomly
[07:28] Nuck: Don't expect it to be any pattern
[07:28] Nuck: And don't expect your thing not to be lodged between two pieces
[07:28] japerry: Nuck, does it remain in that function until it gets called again?
[07:28] melcher has joined the channel
[07:28] Nuck: japerry: The function is only running as long as it's running
[07:28] Nuck: The moment that function's done, it's dead
[07:28] joemccann_ has joined the channel
[07:29] japerry: right, but since its an event function, shouldn't serialport.on stay active indefinitely?
[07:29] Nuck: hmmm?
[07:29] jhurliman has joined the channel
[07:29] Nuck: japerry: The function gets called each time the data event fires
[07:29] konobi: the function gets called each time a peice of data comes in
[07:29] Nuck: A function only lasts as long as it's got something to do
[07:29] mikedeboer has joined the channel
[07:29] Druide has joined the channel
[07:29] Nuck: And even then, with async, it'll return before then
[07:29] japerry: oh ahh okay .. sorry heh I need to be not thinking what I usually think 
[07:30] Nuck: japerry: Yeah, Node takes a bit of a changed mindset
[07:30] EhevuTov_: unlearn what you have learned
[07:30] konobi: async ftw
[07:30] Nuck: Async 4 lyfe
[07:30] Emmanuel__ has joined the channel
[07:30] japerry: right. .. the function will fire whenever.. so to be clear, the stuff below the serialport.on will execute immediately.. this is where the current buffer gets its data processed
[07:31] melcher has joined the channel
[07:31] japerry: I guess I'm a little worried that the event will fire before that stuff finishes processing?
[07:31] Nuck: japerry: Everything below that will be called immediately, yep
[07:31] konobi: you can always call another function from within your event callback
[07:31] Nuck: If you want it to be called before the event fires, put it above that
[07:32] melcher has joined the channel
[07:32] konobi: node-ctype may also be useful
[07:33] japerry: okay, cool this gives me a few things to look at. I think these buffer tools should help
[07:33] EhevuTov_: japerry, is it a fixed length buffer that is streaming in?
[07:33] japerry: I'm putting this code up on github right now
[07:33] japerry: yes..... its one 0x00-0xFF code being sent in at a time

[07:36] EhevuTov_: cool

[07:50] SubStack: DrMcKay: oh I misunderstood
[07:51] DrMcKay: where something from remote side should take care about changing a result into a callback

[07:51] melcher has joined the channel
[07:51] davidbanham: EhevuTov_: I have, and it looked like it was the kind of style I had in mind, but I just have no idea where to start with it. Actually, have just had another look at the Vows site now and realised I never looked at their 'guide' page. I think I'll start there.
[07:51] jesusabdullah: I thought we were talking about automatically exposing objects in the global scope over dnode
[07:52] DrMcKay: SubStack: possibly, but I need something to publish this object or something
[07:52] konobi: node-tap++

[11:57] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[11:57] DrMcKay: guidocalvano: this change allowing you to assert(something) instead of assert.ok(something)
[11:58] guidocalvano: k
[11:58] guidocalvano: handy
[11:58] guidocalvano: are there any other functions in assert?
[11:58] Lingerance: Yes
[11:58] jetienne_: var assert = require('assert').ok; is much simpler no ?
[11:58] TheJH: DrMcKay, now fix your bot quickly so that we can see the responses :D
[11:58] Lingerance: But you can treat a function as an object
[11:58] guidocalvano: yup
[11:58] jetienne_: guidocalvano: yes :)
[11:59] DrMcKay: TheJH: haha, ok
[11:59] guidocalvano: so it is actually just a handy shorthand
[11:59] DrMcKay: guidocalvano: yes
[11:59] TheJH: guidocalvano, yes
[11:59] Lingerance: jetienne_: Yes, but it blocks access to all the other require('assert') functions
[12:00] guidocalvano: no it probably doesn't 
[12:00] guidocalvano: you can assign members to functions
[12:00] jetienne_: i dunno for assert i do console.assert() :)
[12:00] Lingerance: Unless you use a second variable or something like Ext.apply()
[12:00] jetienne_: compatible with browser is cool
[12:00] guidocalvano: var bla = function() { ... } ;
[12:00] guidocalvano: bla.ok = function() { ... } ;
[12:00] guidocalvano: this is all fine
[12:01] guidocalvano: now you can do bla(), but you can also do bla.ok()
[12:01] Lingerance: Yes
[12:01] melcher_ has joined the channel
[12:01] guidocalvano: in fact... I'm thinking you could do this:
[12:01] guidocalvano: ok = function() { ... } ;
[12:01] guidocalvano: *var
[12:01] guidocalvano: exports = ok ;
[12:02] guidocalvano: exports.ok = ok ;
[12:02] guidocalvano: and now you can do exports.bla = ...
[12:02] guidocalvano: and exports.ok.bla will also be there automatically as a consequence
[12:02] guidocalvano: and ok.ok.bla
[12:03] guidocalvano: and ok.ok.ok.bla

[14:24] Brandon_R: are you going to use the pde files or code in direct javascript
[14:24] Brandon_R: i think you can do both
[14:24] errordeveloper: Brandon_R: https://gist.github.com/1254617
[14:25] errordeveloper: Brandon_R: with pde's it's probably better way to go
[14:25] Brandon_R: it does look more simple

[14:27] Brandon_R: i'm thinking about making an infinite canvas in processing
[14:27] errordeveloper: just for the sake of making node do the homework :)

[14:29] jbrokc has left the channel

[15:05] MikeW: Hey guys, any favourite database servers to use with node to dump log data into?
[15:05] Aikar: MikeW: nosql for sure
[15:05] dexter_e: CouchDb or Mongo
[15:06] Aikar: "logdata" may be iffy for mongo, no reason to map log data to memory
[15:06] MikeW: I thought either of those are more document oriented
[15:06] Aikar: yes
[15:06] Aikar: thats the point
[15:06] AvianFlu: so is log data
[15:06] Aikar: send as much data with your log as you want :P
[15:06] Aikar: throw an exception? store entire exception object instead of just the message
[15:06] MikeW: well, with a traditional db there's not a lot of overhead per record
[15:07] Aikar: what makes you think a document based one is?
[15:07] AaronMT has joined the channel
[15:07] dexter_e: what do you mean by 'overhead' ?
[15:08] Aikar: {date: new Date(), level: 'exception': 'message' => 'Foo threw exception A', exception: { line: 32, col: 44, stack: {}}}
[15:08] Aikar: you can add ANYTHING you want on a unique basis for why your logging
[15:09] MikeW: well I don't want to write it to memory so I don't want memory chewed up until I want to come back and read it out a few days later, and I don't want too many bytes wrapping each entry
[15:09] Aikar: good luck doing that with SQL in a sane manner
[15:09] Aikar: hince why i said mongo may be iffy
[15:09] Aikar: so look at couch

[15:11] Aikar: no schema, you just throw objects at it

[15:11] Aikar: and a specific key on the obj is the primary key (auto generated usually)
[15:11] jesster7 has left the channel
[15:12] Aikar: with mongodb you can even query on it find({"foo.bar": "baz"})

[15:34] Brandon_R: yes
[15:34] Brandon_R: asyncronous error handling
[15:34] Brandon_R: i have a question
[15:34] skyl has joined the channel
[15:34] Brandon_R: is doing everything asyncronously slow down the app?
[15:34] Aikar: uh... no...
[15:35] Aikar: thats the point of async
[15:35] Brandon_R: like 2 + 2 vs function(err, ret){return 2 + 2}
[15:35] Aikar: it speeds it up
[15:35] Brandon_R: context switching
[15:35] Brandon_R: takes resources
[15:35] devongovett has joined the channel
[15:35] Brandon_R: question is when does it add up
[15:35] Aikar: its not switching context
[15:35] ypcx: by a chance I have found a workaround for the current situation yesterday: http://github.com/CrabDude/trycatch - not sure what are the caveats besides a bit of bloat
[15:35] Aikar: unless you use fibers
[15:35] cthulhu_lovecraf has joined the channel
[15:35] Brandon_R: what's fibers
[15:35] Aikar: which is a total optional choice in userland
[15:35] Aikar: context switching
[15:35] Aikar: "green threads"
[15:36] xerox: ypcx: whoa

[15:37] djcoin has joined the channel
[15:37] Brandon_R: any tutorials on how to make everything asyncronous
[15:38] ypcx: Brandon_R: no need to make everything async, that's a fallacy.. you can do it, but your code will be much harder to manage
[15:38] Aikar: first you need to understand async
[15:38] ypcx: Brandon_R: you can for example use the event bus pattern, if you insist
[15:39] Aikar: function add(input, cb) { cb(2+ input); } add(4, function(result) { console.log(result) });
[15:39] Aikar: that LOOKS async
[15:39] Aikar: but its actually sync
[15:39] Aikar: async involves calling functions that will take a while to return a result, like reading a file, and passing a callback for when its done.
[15:39] mediaslave has joined the channel
[15:40] Aikar: the callback will be executed on a different tick of the event loop
[15:40] Aikar: but in that code above
[15:40] ypcx: Brandon_R: effective "async" is via process.nextTick
[15:40] Aikar: the callback is executed on the exact same stack
[15:40] skiz has joined the channel
[15:41] Aikar: im gonna post a few lines as a diagram
[15:41] Aikar: :foo->bar->baz->blah()
[15:41] Aikar: :
[15:41] Aikar: :
[15:41] Aikar: :blooop()
[15:41] Aikar: say you have function foo, that calls bar, that calls baz, that calls blah, all synchronously
[15:42] Aikar: and blah registers an async function bloop
[15:42] eirikb has joined the channel
[15:42] Aikar: that foo-bar-baz-blah callstack unwinds back to : (the event loop)
[15:42] Aikar: the event loop may then sit there for 2 cycles with nothing to do
[15:42] Aikar: then blooop is ready
[15:42] Aikar: so it executes blooop
[15:42] eirikb: Hey. Are there any modules for JS- and CSS-minifying for express? 
[15:43] Brandon_R: nice
[15:43] Aikar: synchronous code keeps building upon a callstack, async runs directly off the event loop
[15:43] Brandon_R: i definitly need a new way of thinking for node :)
[15:43] Aikar: yes, async is a different way of thinking
[15:43] Brandon_R: so
[15:43] Brandon_R: are there any patterns to follow or best practices?
[15:43] Brandon_R: or is this new ground?
[15:43] Aikar: howtonode.com
[15:44] Aikar: and async coding style is very opinionated
[15:44] Brandon_R: it looks like a weird website
[15:44] Brandon_R: like a sedo landing page
[15:44] Aikar: one guy has wrote an awesome module called streamline that lets you write code in a synchronous style

[16:42] ypcx: Brandon_R: it's web based
[16:42] DrMcKay: use vim, it has everything
[16:42] Brandon_R: use emacs, it has everything
[16:42] ypcx: DrMcKay: i find it tiring to have to switch modes all the time with vim

[16:43] ypcx: lol
[16:43] eirikb: I only use sed, it lacks syntax highlighting, but it works
[16:44] DrMcKay: well, you should use cat.
[16:44] ypcx: :)
[16:44] ypcx: vicapow: what interfaces do you want to define? for classes in javascript?
[16:44] eirikb: Hmm, not sure how you would do it with just cat, but you can program with just sed alone
[16:44] infynyxx_ has joined the channel
[16:45] ypcx: ok let's conclude the IDE talk with http://xkcd.com/378/
[16:45] DrMcKay: real programmers use butterflies
[16:46] ypcx: btw when you run node without arguments, it's de facto an editor (shell), but you'd need to call fs.write() manually to save your changes, lol
[16:46] vicapow: ypcx: lol
[16:47] Brandon_R: cloud9 is so pretty lol
[16:48] ypcx: yeah and if your internet goes down, you can use it as an excuse for not coding

[16:53] Brandon_R: hey guys
[16:53] Brandon_R: what are you levels in  mathematics
[16:53] Brandon_R: ?
[16:54] pasku: Someone knows how to make a request to the twitter rest api with node?
[16:54] Aikar: levels... ?
[16:54] Aikar: a game?
[16:54] DrMcKay: pasku: ntwitter
[16:55] pasku: ex: http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline.json?count=200&screen_name=pasku1
[16:55] pasku: and get the json response 
[16:55] Brandon_R: not
[16:55] Brandon_R: now
[16:55] Aikar: my math level is Google
[16:55] Brandon_R: like what classes did you guys take
[16:55] Brandon_R: i want to know what i should learn
[16:56] ypcx: Brandon_R: learn to use Mathematica
[16:56] Aikar: math is something you need to know, but the foundation of programming you neeed CS classes...
[16:56] eirikb: DrMcKay: ntwitter is better/the same as twitter-node?
[16:57] eirikb: Ah
[16:57] eirikb: It's a fork of node-twitter, which again is a fork of twitter-node :D
[16:57] Aikar: and if your in a node.js channel, advanced mathematics is likely not a huge need. if you passed high school math, you "learning programming" you need programming classes next :P
[16:57] pasku: But I only need make a request
[16:57] pasku: to get the json response
[16:58] Brandon_R: did you take cs in college aikar?
[16:58] Aikar: nope
[16:58] Brandon_R: or are you currently in collegio
[16:58] Aikar: I spent my teenage years teaching my self programming
[16:58] Aikar: instead of partying
[16:59] Brandon_R: are you in hs
[16:59] Aikar: nope
[16:59] DrMcKay: eirikb: better
[16:59] Aikar: got a full time job with great pay :P
[16:59] Brandon_R: haha same
[16:59] Aikar: but i did get an associates degree
[16:59] AvianFlu: eirikb: it's the same codebase, upgraded and supported
[16:59] Aikar: but didnt learn anything from it
[16:59] Brandon_R: i mean same with the thing about teaching myself programming
[16:59] Aikar: only got it to help get a job
[16:59] Brandon_R: i don't have a job yet
[17:00] eirikb: AvianFlu: So both jdub and technoweenie are pushing to your repo now?
[17:00] poshboytl has joined the channel
[17:00] Aikar: there is alot of stuff that is really good to learn from a CS degree, but it is stuff you can pickup through practice and google
[17:00] DrMcKay: I do maths quite good, but in most cases you won't need any advanced maths in programming

[17:01] eirikb: AvianFlu: Ok, but you keep mergin then?
[17:01] Brandon_R: i like deep mathematics
[17:01] AvianFlu: no, it's  a fork now
[17:01] DrMcKay: I mean, I know integrals and derivatives, but I've used them only for apps demonstrating how intergals and derivatives work
[17:01] AvianFlu: I just continued the version numbers and fixed a bunch of stuff
[17:01] Brandon_R: i want to convert the entire euclid elements proofs to rephaeljs
[17:01] Aikar: (CERN = the LHC particle collider :P)
[17:01] DrMcKay: *integrals
[17:01] Brandon_R: just for fun
[17:01] AvianFlu: neither of the other libs are currently maintained, I believe

[17:02] eirikb: AvianFlu: I have been using twitter-node, but it seems I need to switch to your version then :)
[17:02] infynyxx_ has joined the channel

[17:04] jp_ has left the channel
[17:04] AvianFlu: allegedly the stream urls are all https: now
[17:04] AvianFlu: and the http ones don't work anymore

[17:05] AvianFlu: but that's what I heard

[17:05] AvianFlu: two of the API urls had to change, that was the only real fix needed
[17:05] eirikb: Where twit is new (require('twitter')) from twitter-node
[17:06] eirikb: ok
[17:06] AvianFlu: on the streams thing anyway

[17:08] AvianFlu: they want to control access, which I can understand
[17:08] eirikb: Yeah I guess, but many of the calls could be fully open
[17:09] AvianFlu: their API docs ask users repeatedly to minimize concurrent connections and churn whenever possible - I'd imagine they want to be able to ban people
[17:09] AvianFlu: it is a free service, after all
[17:10] localhost has joined the channel
[17:10] eirikb: Yeah. And probably very heavily used

[18:36] indutny: swair: are you going to build 0.5.x?
[18:36] indutny: swair: it's unstable, try `git checkout v0.4.12 && ./configure && make`

[18:37] swair: ok
[18:37] indutny: erickt: I think he does, because compiling goes to `ld` phase
[18:37] eirikb: yeah I figured as much, but you never know :D
[18:37] indutny: eirikb: libuv was ignored somehow
[18:37] indutny: :)
[18:38] eirikb: indutny: Do you know why node does linking through ld and not within g++?
[18:38] indutny: erickt: not really

[20:29] Brandon_R: hello
[20:30] Brandon_R: what's up guys
[20:30] _bLiNd_RaGe: i've written my own exertnal js file that turns a string into xml, then i usexml2js to turn it into an object
[20:30] _bLiNd_RaGe: parser.on('end', function(result) { eyes.inspect(result); });
[20:31] _bLiNd_RaGe: prints out my object as a json hash, which is cool, but how do i access my actual properties in the object?
[20:31] _bLiNd_RaGe: http://pastebin.com/PqY1x4zY
[20:32] _bLiNd_RaGe: that's my code, and my output is: http://pastebin.com/WygfH6j1
[20:32] navaru has joined the channel
[20:33] _bLiNd_RaGe: i want to say something like sys.puts(a.MSH.MSH\.3.MSH\.3\.1) or however i'd traverse the properties
[20:35] _bLiNd_RaGe: i guess it would be a.MSH["MSH.3"]["MSH.3.1"], but all I get is undefined
[20:36] Brandon_R: what would you guys do if ryan decided to rewrite node.js in java?

[20:50] djko: my consern is that if we want to use same code on client we will need to make some wrappers
[20:50] willwh: should I update this to use cradle instead of couchdb?

[21:45] spcshpopr8r: good morning #node.js
[21:47] ewj: I'm a noob to node, still getting used to things, and I was wondering: what's the usual approach to simple short function calls, is it usually best just to make them block, or handle callbacks?  For instance, I have a function that just checks whether a word is in a (decently long) list, in-memory.  Should I just check the list and return a boolean, or is there any benefit to making that an asynchronous operation?
[21:47] Wizek-other has joined the channel
[21:47] augustl: ewj: if it's in memory there's no point in making it asynchronous
[21:48] ewj: ok, that's what I figured
[21:49] ewj: usually you'd go with async calls for anything involving i/o, for stuff that doesn't blocking is perfectly fine, right?
[21:49] augustl: if it's a long running operation I'd guess there are advantages in chunking it into segments and using process.nextTick, but  that's just a guess
[21:49] spcshpopr8r: I have a peculiar thing going on with a little express app I've cobbled together...I kick off `node app.js` within a gnu screen session, then I detach from the screen and let it run.  It'll be fine for a while and then it'll stop working sorta; specifically, it just doesn't return data to the client.  But, I've discovered if I just reattach to the screen session and hit the enter key, it starts working again
[21:49] augustl: to allow for other items in the event loop to be processed
[21:49] augustl: but that's just a guess, not sure if that's how it actually works
[21:49] AvianFlu: ewj: if it's a cli tool, and you're doing something simple, sync won't screw you 
[21:50] AvianFlu: if it's in a request handler in a server, though, sync will screw you
[21:50] AvianFlu: anything where you've got more than one thing going on at a time, the whole world stops
[21:50] spcshpopr8r: nothing too fancy going on in my app: https://github.com/spaceshipoperator/tsv
[21:50] ewj: well, it's a lookup for a word game, have to check an input word against a vocal list
[21:50] ewj: vocab, I mean
[21:50] AvianFlu: if it's a file read, get the file synchronously once and then keep it in memory?
[21:50] ewj: yeah, that's what I'm doing
[21:50] augustl: ewj: and you don't shell out or go to disk or use network or anything else?
[21:51] AvianFlu: yeah, a sync read on startup for config data you need is totally okay
[21:51] augustl: (not sure what I mean with 'anything else'..)
[21:51] ewj: I just check the in-memory list, I'm wondering if it's okay for that to be sync
[21:51] augustl: I agree with AvianFlu :)
[21:51] augustl: require is synchronous, for example

[22:53] mike_miller: bnoordhuis: basically, I'm reading in a really large CSV file in which each line will spawn an HTTP connection. I'm worried about what will happen if I spawn a connection as soon as I finish a line.
[22:53] jwhisnant__ has joined the channel

[22:54] Dmitrijus: that is an interesting problem
[22:54] brianseeders has joined the channel
[22:54] bnoordhuis: mike_miller: you'll probably run into the ulimit sooner or later
[22:55] Dmitrijus: ACTION wonder how would nicely solve this in node.js :)
[22:55] bnoordhuis: mike_miller: in which case node will throw an exception
[22:56] mike_miller: maybe I could solve it by invoking a function startRequest every x milliseconds which pulled a request off a queue, which was added to by the CSV parser
[22:56] mike_miller: startRequest would only start a request if the # of outstanding requests was < n
[22:56] mike_miller: where n is some value less than ulimit
[22:57] bnoordhuis: mike_miller: sorry, i thought this was about the net module
[22:57] squeese has joined the channel
[22:57] bnoordhuis: the http module uses a per-host queue
[22:57] mike_miller: oh, interesting
[22:57] mike_miller: that sounds too limiting
[22:57] mike_miller: well
[22:57] mike_miller: can multiple requests be inflight at once?
[22:57] bnoordhuis: yes
[22:58] bnoordhuis: and you can make the queue bigger
[22:58] AphelionZ has joined the channel
[22:58] bnoordhuis: that is, raise the # of active requests
[22:58] mike_miller: how does that work under the hood? there's a single file descriptor pointed at the server, and the requests just roll off the queue as they finish?
[22:58] skm has joined the channel
[22:59] bnoordhuis: almost. there are one or more pooled connections, each with its own fd
[22:59] mike_miller: and the # of pooled connections is equal to the size of the queue?
[23:00] fairwinds has joined the channel
[23:01] bnoordhuis: mike_miller: not by default
[23:01] bnoordhuis: the pool size by default is 5 i think
[23:01] bnoordhuis: if all connections are busy, new requests are put on a pending queue
[23:02] mike_miller: the pool is per-host
[23:02] mike_miller: ?
[23:02] bnoordhuis: maybe fifo is a better word for the queue
[23:02] bnoordhuis: yes
[23:02] bnoordhuis: host:port actually
[23:02] shanebo: hey guys what's the best way to access an instance of a module within a file required in the module itself?
[23:02] mike_miller: is the queue of infinite size (subject to the constraint of memory :) ) ?
[23:03] bnoordhuis: mike_miller: yep
[23:03] mike_miller: awesome, didn't realize node handled all this so nicely! :)
[23:04] mike_miller: btw, how do I adjust the size of the queue?
[23:04] bnoordhuis: mike_miller: you mean the size of the connection pool?
[23:04] mike_miller: sorry, yes.
[23:05] bnoordhuis: create a new http.Agent object and pass in {maxSockets:42}
[23:05] bnoordhuis: then pass that agent object to http.request()

[23:45] freewil: and then the callback was being called and it was no longer defined

[23:53] freewil: it shifts it off the array

[23:54] shanebo: I've never understood why shift and unshift don't return the array
[23:54] slickplaid: it's because it actually mutates the array rather than just returning a value
