[00:14] MooGoo: global?
[00:14] MooGoo: i thought irc was only in america
[00:14] skiz: there are a few rouge servers in istanbul :(
[00:14] dynacker: afaik, americans think nothing exists outside of america

[00:16] Skyec: ryah: I was just looking at your g+ plus post on the 30th and I couldn't help but think of Smalltalk. Don't get me wrong, I love nodejs, just sometimes I get frustrated with JS
[00:17] hermanju_ has joined the channel
[00:17] dynacker: thought you didn't use g+ Skyec ..
[00:17] dynacker: caught out
[00:17] Skyec: i don't, but unlike Facebook, you don't need an account to view people's posts
[00:18] dynacker: so you're stalking ryah 
[00:18] sechrist: spawning bash prompts as vim split views
[00:18] sechrist: makes me feel like superman
[00:18] dynacker: creepy guy
[00:18] Skyec: i don't need to stalk people. google does that for me, with all of its spiders
[00:19] hunterloftis: Hey guys - again please let me know if there's anybody on here interested in well-paying node.js jobs centered on mobile html5 and realtime/websockets work
[00:19] dynacker: sounds like our start up Skyec 
[00:20] dynacker: hunterloftis stole our idea!
[00:20] ryah: Skyec: js is a pragmatic choice - it's not my ideal language
[00:20] hunterloftis: dynacker: what's Skyec? I'd like to learn more about it. We work for funded startups, so we actually don't have our own idea, no worries ;)

[00:22] dynacker: sounds stupid

[00:22] enmand has joined the channel
[00:22] MooGoo: hitler would love irc
[00:22] sechrist: I would like to run PHP code in a node vm
[00:22] sechrist: indeed
[00:22] MooGoo: he'd rage all day
[00:22] ryah: ckknight: im not really a language person
[00:22] dynacker: ryah: prefers grunting at things
[00:22] dynacker: geh gah geehh 
[00:22] Skyec: ckknight: thanks for bringing up altjs. I wasn't aware there was a term for these things
[00:23] sechrist: coffeescript drip drip coffescript
[00:23] ckknight: <-- making an altjs language, not published yet
[00:23] Skyec: the problem is that, even with altjs, i don't think you get some of the "cool" things that come with other languages
[00:23] Skyec: like coroutines in Smalltalk, which is done at the VM level
[00:23] MooGoo: do any altjs's have operator overloading?
[00:24] ckknight: MooGoo: the one I'm writing does :P
[00:24] sechrist: operator overloading is something I forgot exists
[00:24] MooGoo: some altjs's do callback unwrapping or something which is somewhat like coroutines
[00:24] ckknight: MooGoo: it statically assures that something is either a rich object or a number, if a number, use native '+', if an object, do ['+'](arg)
[00:24] sechrist: FIBERS
[00:24] MooGoo: least in code structer
[00:24] Skyec: i don't like operator overloading
[00:25] hunterloftis: dynacker: I'm not familiar enough with pollenizer - beyond their basic mission statement - to really address how similar we may be
[00:25] Skyec: but i don't feel that strongly about it
[00:25] MooGoo: ckknight, yea I could not concieve another way really
[00:25] ckknight: MooGoo: best way I thought of
[00:25] hunterloftis: dynacker: For six years we've been 'implementers' for agencies, marketing firms, etc - and recently 75% of our revenue has started coming from funded startups
[00:26] MooGoo: it's hard to know what a js variable or property is at run time
[00:26] ckknight: because if you always have it proxy and do runtime checking, it's horrifically slow
[00:26] hunterloftis: dynacker: so now I'm in charge of that, and we need to expand our developer team
[00:26] MooGoo: could use some compiler type hints or something
[00:26] ckknight: MooGoo: yeah, I do it by compiler hints. (x as Number) -> x + 5
[00:27] dynacker: hunterloftis: what do you mean by coming from funded startups. do you fund them and supply the developers?
[00:27] hunterloftis: dynacker: No they're externally (usually both privately & VC) funded, and we implement their technology
[00:27] hermanju_ has joined the channel

[00:29] sechrist: on the req page
[00:30] sechrist: wow what happened to that sentence
[00:30] hunterloftis: And we've (by we I mean the 3 core node developers) recently convinced management to commit a large portion of our web app team to node.js work
[00:30] AvianFlu: lol some dude I was trolling was telling me I was wasting my life on node
[00:30] Murvin has joined the channel

[00:30] AvianFlu: "I'm gonna laugh so hard when your life's work becomes obsolete and laughed at!"
[00:30] AvianFlu: I was like "I've been using it for four months..."
[00:30] MooGoo: javascript is a fad language
[00:30] sechrist: which is a hell of a lot more gratifying since it's fun
[00:30] AvianFlu: "...I think I'll pivot just fine"
[00:31] dynacker: looks neat hunterloftis 
[00:31] MooGoo: nodejs is not crappy enough to be succesful
[00:31] hunterloftis: dynacker: thanks - it's been fun screwing with node in production for a while. Charlotte doesn't have tons of good devs though, sadly, so we're trying hard to find more.
[00:32] sechrist: The real defining point is if the really shitty turn-key world picks up on it.
[00:32] kenperkins has joined the channel
[00:32] sechrist: PHP's proliferation is partially because of the proliferation of the LAMP stack
[00:32] sechrist: actually that's pretty much it entirely
[00:32] MooGoo: also cause it was designed for retards
[00:32] sechrist: noobs could start a shared hosting company with cpanel
[00:32] sechrist: make money
[00:32] sechrist: their clients want simple CMS products
[00:32] sechrist: multiply that times 1 million
[00:32] hunterloftis: sechrist: I would love to have a LAMP stack equivalent in node. I think another nice thing about PHP is that it's less fragile, in production, than node. Harder for one piece to bring down everything.
[00:33] sechrist: hunterloftis, that is "architecture"
[00:33] sechrist: not node
[00:33] hunterloftis: sechrist: no, it's definitely node.
[00:33] hunterloftis: sechrist: don't get me wrong, I love building in node
[00:33] hunterloftis: But the deployment process for node and php is fundamentally different
[00:33] MooGoo: javascript also was also designed to be ez to use for the skilless masses
[00:33] sechrist: for node.. there isn't a deployment process
[00:33] hunterloftis: In PHP, you're not responsible for the actual "web server" component
[00:34] sechrist: unless you're looking at haibu
[00:34] sechrist: or you roll one
[00:34] hunterloftis: sechrist: "there isn't a deployment process?"
[00:34] sechrist: there isn't
[00:34] hunterloftis: Yeah, exactly - you roll one
[00:34] hunterloftis: That's my point actually
[00:34] hunterloftis: I would love to have a LAMP stack equivalent, so everybody didn't roll one
[00:34] sechrist: my deployment process is dsh with a bash script that git pulls and restarts the script that's running in forever
[00:34] sechrist: not much of a "process"
[00:35] hunterloftis: Also not very stable; if for example one part of your script hangs, your whole app hangs
[00:35] hunterloftis: Don't get me wrong, I love node and we're investing a lot into it
[00:35] MooGoo: in other words most programers would have no idea what to do
[00:35] sechrist: and I actually kind of agree with that troll ted dziba dude
[00:35] hunterloftis: But I try to avoid pretending like node is better than all other platforms on every count, because it's not
[00:35] sechrist: dsh with unix utils and stdin is really powerful
[00:35] Aria has joined the channel
[00:35] MooGoo: sounds like CGI
[00:35] dynacker: would be neat to run nodejs in a console (think like irssi)
[00:36] sechrist: dsh is a ssh wrapper that you can run scripts in parallel across a list of nodes,
[00:36] sechrist: or in order if you change the flag
[00:36] sechrist: yes there are more fancy things, but all this needs is an ssh key setup and the hostname in ~/.dsh/group/awesome-cloud1
[00:37] Murvin: I'm using Node 0.4.12  and I'm using npm 1.0.93   I tried to install connect-gzip and connect-mongo  and got Unmet problem.

[00:55] detaos: vyshay: yes.
[00:56] hunterloftis: LAMP stack = ease of deployment. Ease of deployment with node would be the best thing for real, production node.js usage
[00:57] ckknight: hunterloftis: I've found it easy to deploy node apps on cloud-run servers. If it's your own server, you could use capistrano and some nice settings to get that going
[00:57] ckknight: maybe the node community has a capistrano-like solution by now
[00:58] dynacker: <insert buzz words>
[00:58] hunterloftis: ckknight: Do you mean production apps, that need to recover from crashes, run on multiple processes and multiple servers simultaneously, have full logging and be easily rolled back or upgraded in place without service loss?
[00:58] hunterloftis: I'm not saying it's hard to *run* node apps
[00:58] ckknight: that is what I'm referring to
[00:59] hunterloftis: Could you link me? I'd be interested
[00:59] cognominal has joined the channel
[00:59] hunterloftis: That's one of the biggest things we've struggled with... consistent, reliable deployments across multiple servers.
[00:59] ckknight: regardless, you'd still need to do a good bit of work until you get it automated
[00:59] hunterloftis: Well I guess that's the sticking point
[00:59] hunterloftis: With a LAMP stack you don't have to do a good bit of work ;)
[00:59] ckknight: hunterloftis: https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano
[01:00] hunterloftis: I'm not advocating LAMP... we avoid PHP like the plague
[01:00] ckknight: as well you should
[01:00] hunterloftis: But the best selling point of a LAMP project is that it will be easy and universal to deploy
[01:00] hunterloftis: But you'd have to be kidding to suggest node is easy or universal to deploy to a production environment
[01:01] ckknight: yeah, not at this stage, at least
[01:01] hunterloftis: Yeah node is young, it's not a hugely difficult problem just one that isn't solved yet
[01:01] hunterloftis: Between npm and cluster there's a lot of progress already

[01:52] DTrejo: I'm just curious about who's involved
[01:52] piscisaureus: ah
[01:52] DTrejo: recruiting season is coming around
[01:52] piscisaureus: are you going to recruit him
[01:52] piscisaureus: noooo
[01:52] DTrejo: oh no
[01:52] DTrejo: vice versa hehe
[01:52] DTrejo: I'm still in school
[01:52] DTrejo: junior at brown
[01:52] piscisaureus: DTrejo: the way to get hired is to send patches
[01:53] DTrejo: sent a few docs patches a long time ago
[01:53] piscisaureus: DTrejo: or to start your own cool OSS project / mpdule

[01:53] DTrejo: not ready yet

[01:53] kersny: speaking of getting hired… anyone know if Joyent is hiring interns next summer for node-related stuff?
[01:53] DTrejo: also not open sourced yet
[01:54] DTrejo: kersny: did they have interns last summer? I feel like they didn't
[01:54] konobi: no interns as of yet
[01:54] kersny: DTrejo: I haven't seen anything indicating any
[01:54] kersny: oh, ok

[01:54] konobi: DTrejo: are you in sync with isaacs about that?
[01:55] DTrejo: about the project?
[01:55] DTrejo: yes
[01:55] isaacs: konobi: yes, i plan to let DTrejo do some of the heavy lifting, and then either absorb him into the npm fold, or crush him as a competitor.
[01:55] isaacs: one or the other.
[01:55] DTrejo: :)
[01:55] isaacs: should be fun either way.
[01:55] konobi: sweet
[01:55] DTrejo: I suspect similarly :)
[01:56] isaacs: i mean, the first few versions of this thing will need to be rewritten anyhow, as is the way with software.
[01:56] DTrejo: starting in on a 1/2 rewrite heh
[01:56] DTrejo: slash cleanup

[02:05] DTrejo: konobi: as long as they have an option to output TAP, they will be supported, as we support TAP
[02:05] konobi: DTrejo: no... stuff to build atop node-tap
[02:05] jesusabdullah: isaacs: Is there a tool in npm for validating package names?
[02:05] isaacs: well, there's npm?
[02:06] konobi: Test::Differences or Test::Exception or Test::LongString for example
[02:06] isaacs: i mean, it'll explode if the package.json's name isn't valid
[02:06] isaacs: jesusabdullah: any time you do anythign
[02:06] DTrejo: konobi: oh you mean those things as a feature of a test framework, e.g. vows/expresso/etc ?
[02:07] DTrejo: I'm not familiar with those
[02:07] a_suenami has joined the channel
[02:07] seebees: isaacs: so failure indicates success?  very zen.
[02:07] konobi: DTrejo: those all use Test::Builder underneath... so it's a common TAP producer
[02:07] jesusabdullah: isaacs: I'm using it programmatically, but I want to filter out all cases where it could try to look for the package on my computer
[02:07] DTrejo: konobi: i
[02:08] DTrejo: konobi: if something fails, we plan to just supply all the stdoutput

[04:05] JWarm: alright
[04:05] hermanjunge_: it throws me an https://gist.github.com/cfafa65665ce5b0675cc
[04:05] hermanjunge_: it says that connect requires node 0.5.0
[04:06] ag4ve has joined the channel
[04:06] hermanjunge_: was it arbitrary, or the new convention is using node > 0.5?
[04:06] isaacs: hermanjunge_: yeah, the problem is that you're getting connect@2.0.0alpha, which is in fact <2.0.0
[04:06] hermanjunge_: i'm with 4.12

[04:07] isaacs: put "dependencies": { "connect": "1.7.1" } in your package.json file
[04:08] vipaca has joined the channel
[04:08] hermanjunge_: that overrides the requirement express does?

[04:22] isaacs: hi
[04:23] isaacs: indexzero: it's hit, but the io there is nonblocking, and the exit is immediate.
[04:23] isaacs: process.exit is destructive.
[04:23] isaacs: loses io
[04:23] indexzero: isaacs: it doesn't print the console.dir even if I remove the process.exit() statement
[04:24] isaacs: console.dir(err); process.stdout.on("drain", function () { process.exit(1) })
[04:24] tbranyen: probably the throw
[04:24] jocafa: It salts the ground and burns the crops on the way out.
[04:24] indexzero: isaacs: ok, thanks
[04:24] isaacs: indexzero: oh, yeah, that first few line
[04:24] tbranyen: usually you want to stop events from firing if you throw an uncaught exception inside
[04:25] isaacs: indexzero: i think ryah is planning on making stdout blocking, though
[04:25] isaacs: mostly to avoid this kind of craziness.

[04:27] hermanjunge_: May a ask something conceptual about events?
[04:28] hermanjunge_: http.request() { }
[04:28] context: i dont know. may you?
[04:28] Stephen: hermanjunge_: Sure
[04:28] hermanjunge_: you set it up
[04:28] hermanjunge_: then you subscribe to req.on('error'...
[04:28] hermanjunge_: what happens if you have the error before subscribing to it?
[04:29] hermanjunge_: does the error event gets enqueued or something?
[04:29] hermanjunge_: it is buggin me for weeks
[04:29] Stephen: Ok, so you setup an event
[04:29] Stephen: "CustomEvent"
[04:29] hermanjunge_: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.12/api/all.html#http.request
[04:29] hermanjunge_: this one in particular
[04:29] Stephen: and while subscribing to "CustomEvent", you get an error
[04:30] Stephen: Is this the appropriate scenario?
[04:30] hermanjunge_: once the }); of var req = http.request(.. is done
[04:30] JWarm: where can i find a git download of a stable version of npm?
[04:30] hermanjunge_: you have a space of time, a windows of time 
[04:30] ckknight: hermanjunge_: due to the single-threaded nature of javascript, this shouldn't be a problem, as long as you don't "wait" to register for "error"
[04:31] hermanjunge_: more conceptual
[04:31] Stephen: what ckknight said
[04:31] hermanjunge_: the single-thread is a point, I agree
[04:31] hermanjunge_: :D
[04:31] ckknight: it won't do any processing until the next event pump cycle
[04:31] hermanjunge_: what happens if I make the declaration req.on('error'... say after I put on some stdouts?
[04:31] MatthewS has joined the channel
[04:32] hermanjunge_: a couple console.log('this'); console.log('that'); ?
[04:32] hermanjunge_: can I catch the error still?
[04:32] Stephen: You should subscribe to error first
[04:32] hermanjunge_: sorry, can I _still_ catch the error
[04:32] mraleph has joined the channel
[04:32] hermanjunge_: ok
[04:32] hermanjunge_: but the window of time ain't a problem then
[04:32] Stephen: After subscribing? No.
[04:33] hermanjunge_: OHHHH, I see
[04:33] hermanjunge_: maybe the request doesn't start until the next tick
[04:33] hermanjunge_: then I have 'time' to subscribe to error
[04:33] hermanjunge_: I mean it guys, I'd be thinking a lot on that, but didn't dare to ask
[04:34] Stephen: Errors are global...  subscribing to an event does not require the promise of that event firing
[04:34] Stephen: Well, nodejs namespaces them
[04:34] hermanjunge_: no, i'm not talking of having the error
[04:34] context: With http.request() one must always call req.end() to signify that you're done with the request - even if there is no data being written to the request body.
[04:35] context: or you could read the docs
[04:35] hermanjunge_: but of the chance of losing that error
[04:35] context: i would not subscribe to any event after ending the request.
[04:35] hermanjunge_: well, I think I got it
[04:35] Stephen: hermanjunge_: Subscribe to the error event before ever creating the object
[04:35] Stephen: then you're covered

[08:53] Lemon_BE has joined the channel
[08:53] konobi: HardPhuck: no, not really
[08:53] jetienne_: HardPhuck: or easier, quit the process, and have your node.js run in another program
[08:54] konobi: use smf, upstart or god or something
[08:54] jetienne_: HardPhuck: forever, supervisor etc...
[08:54] HardPhuck: okie
[08:54] jetienne_: HardPhuck: you can write your own. this is just a loop with a spawn in it
[08:55] konobi: using exec from within the process sounds easy, but you have to do a lot of environmental stuff for it to work correclty
[08:57] Glenjamin: plus there isn't an exec in core node

[09:01] HardPhuck: just like in wordpress for example where you can put html in the template and it get's parsed on the output

[12:00] deanc[work]: Hi folks. I just tried to install the less package using npm, but when i type the lessc command it says it's not found
[12:00] deanc[work]: I checked $PATH and /local/bin is in the path, and less was installed @ ~/local/node_modules ...
[12:00] DrMcKay: deanc[work]: sudo npm install -g less
[12:01] SamuraiJack has joined the channel
[12:01] deanc[work]: DrMcKay, done. what should i expect?
[12:01] deanc[work]: ah, well now it works :)
[12:01] deanc[work]: Can you explain to me, as to why?
[12:02] DrMcKay: deanc[work]: -g switch installs a package globally
[12:02] DrMcKay: to /usr/local/node_modules or /usr/node_modules, depending on your node prefix
[12:02] davidbanham has joined the channel
[12:02] DrMcKay: and binaries get linked in /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin
[12:03] metaverse has joined the channel
[12:03] deanc[work]: okay
[12:03] deanc[work]: is it common practice to use -g?

[12:30] deanc[work]: https://github.com/cloudhead/less.js/issues/320 But i have this issue

[14:34] tjholowaychuk: npm considers 2.0.0alpha1 < 2.0.0
[14:35] tjholowaychuk: so for express i had connect capped at < 2.0.0
[14:35] nibblebot: ah
[14:35] nibblebot: i think i need to get latest npm then
[14:35] tjholowaychuk: no it's just a package.json issue with older express releases
[14:35] tjholowaychuk: i cant possibly go fix them all
[14:35] tjholowaychuk: so i dont know what a great solution is for that

[15:08] eventualbuddha: so why is it that 'foo' instanceof String is false?

[15:09] eventualbuddha: tjholowaychuk: is there a more reliable way?
[15:09] zemanel has joined the channel
[15:09] tjholowaychuk: typeof foo == 'string' will help you there
[15:09] xerox: the most reliable way I think it's checking typeof object.somepropertyspecifictoString != 'undefined'
[15:09] tjholowaychuk: but they are really broken IMO
[15:10] xerox: (you don't need !== because typeof is bound to return strings)
[15:10] uchuff has joined the channel
[15:10] xerox: not that anybody asked me :P

[15:11] Glenjamin: in reality, == vs === very rarely comes up
[15:11] eventualbuddha: but in the meantime he'll fuck u pour code
[15:11] Glenjamin: apart from when you want 1 == '1'
[15:11] eventualbuddha: um
[15:11] eventualbuddha: "fuck up our code"
[15:11] eventualbuddha: thank you, spaces
[15:11] tjholowaychuk: aahhaha
[15:11] tjholowaychuk: fuck u pour code!
[15:11] xerox: ACTION pours code
[15:11] eventualbuddha: lol
[15:12] xerox: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#Methods_2
[15:12] xerox: so any of those method would work, maybe not length since it's also for Array ?
[15:12] eventualbuddha: xerox: I've found typeof to be reliable for strings
[15:12] eventualbuddha: for regexps… well,  you just have to look at isRegExp in jQuery to know how fucked up that is
[15:13] Glenjamin: why do you need to know its a string?
[15:13] Glenjamin: could you just duck type it? :)
[15:13] Guest40022: instance of only works for checking things that have been create with a constructor
[15:13] Guest40022: instanceof
[15:13] eventualbuddha: Glenjamin: nah. as an example, could be a name of a predefined function or a custom function passed in
[15:13] Guest40022: those include literals of [] and {}
[15:14] eventualbuddha: Guest40022: that may be, but 'foo'.constructor is still defined
[15:14] Glenjamin: eventualbuddha: make sense, i'd probably typeof  == 'function' and toString anything else
[15:14] eventualbuddha: so it just feels broken to me
[15:14] Guest40022: yes
[15:14] ^robertj has joined the channel
[15:14] tjholowaychuk: eventualbuddha it is broken
[15:14] Guest40022: instanceof of does feel broken
[15:14] tjholowaychuk: they're both broken
[15:14] Glenjamin: 'foo' is a string primitive, 'foo'.method approximately maps to new String('foo').method
[15:14] Guest40022: typeof I think is fine
[15:15] jtsnow has joined the channel
[15:15] xerox: I think it can be 'object' instead of 'string' an awful lot of times
[15:15] eventualbuddha: don't worry guys, I've already figured this out. it's just that I'm trying to make my app compatible with both the xulrunner and node.js js runtimes
[15:15] eventualbuddha: so I'm hunting for differences
[15:15] eventualbuddha: see, here's my "type" module: https://github.com/wesabe/ssu/blob/master/application/chrome/content/wesabe/lang/type.coffee
[15:15] xerox: actually...
[15:15] xerox: I just remembered a thing.
[15:15] joshkehn has left the channel

[15:16] erickt_ has joined the channel
[15:16] xerox: it says "Requires JavaScript 1.8.5" but it works in node
[15:16] eventualbuddha: Guest40022: typeof new String() == 'object'

[15:16] r04r: bnoord
[15:16] r04r: ...That was supposed to go in the search dialog
[15:17] bnoordhuis: r04r: i think you're looking for me?
[15:17] erichynds has joined the channel
[15:17] Aikar: each of the primitive types also has an object type, so 'foo' is not instance of String because its not the object  ver, but new String('foo') == instanceof String
[15:17] Guest40022: yes new String, and new Number are both objects
[15:17] diogogmt has joined the channel
[15:18] Aikar: I had read that V8 will silently convert them to object form when using them, and that doing the conversion to object form yourself would be a performance increase, but I couldnt find that to be true. 
[15:18] Guest40022: typeof is for primitives, instanceof is for the prototypal chain (constructed objects)
[15:18] eventualbuddha: yeah, it's just fucked up imo ;)
[15:18] Aikar: maybe it is outside of v8?
[15:18] catb0t has joined the channel

[15:19] Glenjamin: what
[15:19] tjholowaychuk: you dont really need typeof for props like that
[15:19] Glenjamin: why
[15:19] tjholowaychuk: undefined === foo.something
[15:20] hitana has joined the channel
[15:20] eventualbuddha: ideally you'd want typeof foo.substr == 'function'
[15:20] r04r: bnoordhuis: Just wanted to see if you were around, but did so a bit clumsily. 
[15:20] xerox: tjholowaychuk: I think you do
[15:20] Glenjamin: var func = typeof arg == 'function' ? arg : collection_of_functions[arg.toString()]
[15:20] xerox: accessing undefined properties can lead to exceptions
[15:20] Aikar: or you can do if ( (new global[ucfirst(typeof foo)]) instanceof String) { if you really want to be silly!
[15:21] Aikar: err 
[15:21] Aikar: or you can do if ( (new global[ucfirst(typeof foo)])(foo) instanceof String) { if you really want to be silly!
[15:21] tjholowaychuk: xerox typeof foo.bar will still throw

[15:21] Aikar: > typeof foo.bar
[15:21] Aikar: ReferenceError: foo is not defined
[15:21] tjholowaychuk: but if it is undefined === foo.bar is fine
[15:22] xerox: I did not come up with this myself tho, I read it on some website
[15:22] xerox: I wish I could remember which
[15:22] Guest40022: Could be just me here, but this conversation really makes me feel that there's a lot of people on here (and probably all over the node commune) that NEED to know the difference between Objects and object primitives

[17:41] halcyon918: Hey folks.. so I watched this preso http://sna-projects.com/blog/2011/08/nodejs/ which included a demo of nearly 1M concurrent connections to a server socket... I'm trying to replicate, but I keep hitting the ulimit on open files on the server even though I've bumped it to 65k... I thought node used multiplexed sockets, so I'm curious how I can replicate this demo
[17:41] Aikar: why is H in haraka capitolized on npm
[17:41] xerox has joined the channel
[17:42] baudehlo: because it's an application not a library
[17:43] TheJH: halcyon918, multiplexed sockets?
[17:43] smathy has joined the channel
[17:43] TheJH: halcyon918, if you use require('net'), node give you plain old TCP sockets
[17:43] hacksparrow: This RegEx seems a little too complex for me: eplace all instances of "Dogs" with "Cats", except those between "SPECIAL" and "/SPECIAL" anyone?

[17:44] halcyon918: TheJH: That's what the demo uses... require('net')
[17:44] neilk_ has joined the channel
[17:44] TheJH: hacksparrow, you could do it with a simple regex and a replace function

[17:46] slickplaid: is having a model of var User = function(user){ validate and return object } and then having .save() methods for use in the controller (using couchdb) good practice? So in the controller, I can call var client = new Client(req.body.client); and client.save();
[17:46] Aikar: baudehlo: cp haraka/plugins/auth to conf_dir/plugins/ ?
[17:46] TheJH: hacksparrow, ah, wait, anywhere between special and /special or immediately?
[17:46] baudehlo: haraka -i <dir>; cd <dir>; vi config/plugins
[17:46] thalll has joined the channel
[17:47] hacksparrow: anywhere between, aas many times
[17:47] TheJH: hacksparrow, just SPECIALDogs/SPECIAL? or also SPECIALfooDogsbar/SPECIAL
[17:47] Aikar: my plugins dir in the -i dir is empty
[17:47] TheJH: ?
[17:47] Aikar: will it fall back to haraka install dir?
[17:47] baudehlo: Aikar: yeah that's for your custom plugins
[17:47] Aikar: oh ok
[17:48] fennec: mmm. yeah, it seems that if you have a (playback-from-file) pcap session open, and don't close it, your program never ends…. and if you do close it, you get a segfault :) digging deeper, in any event.
[17:48] Aikar: haraka -h plugins/auth -> no documentation ?
[17:48] baudehlo: so you just put auth/flat_file in config/plugins (can't remember if it's there by default)
[17:48] hacksparrow: I need to replace /('Dogs')+/ with 'Cats' - but only between 'SPECIAL' and '/SPECIAL'
[17:48] baudehlo: and edit config/auth_flat_file.ini
[17:48] smathy has joined the channel
[17:48] hacksparrow: Oh make it /('Dogs')+/g

[17:50] Aikar: baudehlo: / and . used interchangeably in the plugins file?
[17:50] baudehlo: Aikar: I don't understand the Q :)
[17:50] Aikar: i see queue/smtp_forward
[17:50] Aikar: and then mail_from.is_resolvable
[17:50] baudehlo: yeah, it's filenames.
[17:50] halcyon918: but when I used it, I hit the open file ulimit and can't get anywhere near the numbers demoed
[17:51] baudehlo: Aikar: I put the queue and auth ones in a separate dir.
[17:51] pandeiro_ has joined the channel
[17:51] Aikar: oh so it should be dots?
[17:51] Aikar: auth.flat_file
[17:51] Aikar: ?
[17:51] baudehlo: no...
[17:51] halcyon918: And here's the demo client: http://screencast.com/t/FeUogcLlhP8
[17:51] halcyon918: note that the client never disconnects, and the server never disconnects the client, so it must be concurrent
[17:51] cconstantine: is there a page detailing the differences between the 0.4 line and the 0.5?
[17:52] dexter_e: Those using Node as a web server..   Anyone running out of process memory?
[17:52] baudehlo: Aikar: this will probably help make it clearer: https://github.com/baudehlo/Haraka/tree/master/plugins
[17:52] Aikar: ohh i see
[17:52] Aikar: cause the auth plugin is a dir itself
[17:52] TheJH: halcyon918, "i<65000" on the client
[17:52] hacksparrow: dexter_e, I did when I tried running a chat server. But it was on a shared shot.
[17:52] TheJH: halcyon918, if he says he did millions of conenctions, he maybe connected from several machines or so
[17:52] halcyon918: TheJH: right, so the demo uses 16 of those clients
[17:52] TheJH: or several IPs
[17:53] isaacs: hacksparrow:
[17:53] isaacs: > a = "Dogs SPECIAL Dogs Cats Dogs /SPECIAL Dogs Dogs SPECIAL Pet the Dogs /SPECIAL"
[17:53] isaacs: 'Dogs SPECIAL Dogs Cats Dogs /SPECIAL Dogs Dogs SPECIAL Pet the Dogs /SPECIAL'
[17:53] isaacs: > a.replace(/SPECIAL(.*?)\/SPECIAL/g, function (str, middle) { return "SPECIAL" + middle.replace(/Dogs/g, "Cats") + "/SPECIAL" })
[17:53] isaacs: 'Dogs SPECIAL Cats Cats Cats /SPECIAL Dogs Dogs SPECIAL Pet the Cats /SPECIAL'
[17:53] cconstantine: dexter_e, I've noticed a slight increase in memory over time.  it ussually takes a few days to die though
[17:53] cconstantine: dexter_e, monit helps
[17:53] halcyon918: TheJH: but that doesn't explain how the server can handle over the ulimit
[17:53] hacksparrow: Hmmm, let me check it out
[17:53] halcyon918: in my case, the ulimit keeps getting hit and craps out
[17:53] TheJH: halcyon918, sure he didn't bump it to unlimited?
[17:54] TheJH: halcyon918, I guess he talked about a 65k limit, but didn't mean the ulimit, but maximum conenctions per client
[17:54] TheJH: *connections
[17:54] halcyon918: TheJH: it's possible... I tried on my VM but I can't set it unlimited on my instance

[17:56] smtlaissezfaire has joined the channel
[17:56] halcyon918: TheJH: Here's the summary from the preso http://screencast.com/t/SLD8ZO3aOipp
[17:57] hacksparrow: isaacs, arrr ... it should replace them outisde SPECIAL /SPECIAL, not within. Sorry if I pharsed it wrong.
[17:57] dexter_e: hacksparrow: how did you solve the memory problem?
[17:57] Aikar: baudehlo: add more hosts for the rcpt_to do i add new lines to me file
[17:58] Aikar: to add*
[17:58] Aikar: ?
[17:58] halcyon918: its entirely possible my EC2 instance won't allow me to set an unlimited ulimit, so that's a potential reason I can't replicate
[17:58] cconstantine: dexter_e, I mostly just let monit spin it back up when it dies
[17:58] baudehlo: Aikar: config/host_list
[17:58] hacksparrow: It was just a test. Didn't bother. I think a dedicated host would have been able to manage it without any problem. Also the chat server could have been optimized.
[17:58] hswolff has joined the channel
[17:58] baudehlo: but that's for inbound mail, which I didn't think you were doing.
[17:58] Aikar: oh, i thought haraka was a sender
[17:59] baudehlo: both
[17:59] Aikar: i see "rcpt_to.in_host_list" when i attempted to send
[17:59] Aikar: it checked the domain
[17:59] cconstantine: dexter_e, It's not a web server either... more of a webservice server.  The webservers have  persistent socket connection to it, so each request doesn't have to open/close http connections
[17:59] baudehlo: yeah because you weren't using auth.
[17:59] Aikar: and im guessing that blocked it
[17:59] cconstantine: dexter_e, how sure are you that you don't have a memory leak (ie, references to objects you don't care about anymore)
[18:00] Aikar: odd, I added the auth/flat_file to plugins file
[18:00] baudehlo: yes but you need to authenticate the client.
[18:00] Aikar: is it because i didnt send credentials? i was expecting to see a user/pass failure
[18:00] baudehlo: SMTP's not like that.
[18:00] baudehlo: authenticating is optional.

[18:02] baudehlo: but put a real address in the -t param
[18:02] yorick: wankdanker: maybe it's a node v0.4 issue
[18:02] Aikar: well im not worried about bombing emails, our firewall blocks outgoing 25 on internal dev network (for good reasons) so wanna least make it look like its gotten to the point of conn refused then test on the actual server itll live lol
[18:02] yorick: or maybe I haven't tested it well enough
[18:02] dexter_e: cconstantine: not sure at all, its probably a leak indeed 
[18:03] baudehlo: Aikar: yeah, my point is just using swaks makes it easier to see if it's working.
[18:03] dexter_e: Ive been recommended to use monit to reboot the process if mem hits a threshold
[18:03] yorick: wankdanker: the internet suggests a compiler mis-optimization
[18:04] Aikar: dexter_e: id much rather control that in the app itself so you can properly/safely shutdown gracefully...
[18:04] dexter_e: How to ensure monit doesnt reboot it mid-request?
[18:04] yorick: or maybe node is unlocking a mutex in another thread as the one that locked it
[18:04] Aikar: just register a setInterval that checks memory every 30s
[18:05] Aikar: and send an email alert to look into a memory leak issue :P
[18:05] dexter_e: Aikar: right thats what im thinking too....  post request run a mem check and crash itself if mem is running out yeah?
[18:05] yorick: wankdanker: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1105745/pthread-mutex-assertion-error

[18:06] Aikar: dexter_e: then you got the next solution to figure out of making it auto restart :P

[18:08] yorick: wankdanker: v0.5 removed C++ eventemitter, so I had to get rid of that
[18:08] Aikar: baudehlo: would it be possible in any way (in the future) to embed haraka and tie to same port as others like express middleware?
[18:09] jocafa: halcyon918:  yeah i know how to do that… i mean a module for node that will take that input and output the html-ized code within that block :)

[18:13] dexter_e: I just got an idea. What if the client calls back to the server once its all loaded with a loadComplete() and that function checks mem and reboots if past threshold.. sound reasonable?
[18:13] wankdanker: yorick: k, thanks. 
[18:13] Aikar: but main thing i was looking for is sharing same port
[18:13] dexter_e: that way we trigger reboot after the request is totally finished
[18:13] Aikar: if the handshake looks SMTP, haraka takes it, else, express/connect takes it
[18:13] baudehlo: sharing a port?
[18:14] baudehlo: hah.
[18:14] baudehlo: Good luck with that.
[18:14] Aikar: lol

[18:14] jocafa: oooooooooooor i could just pipe it through vim.

[20:08] Nuck: Or something like that
[20:08] Nuck: You then process exports and module.exports and make them cooperate
[20:08] Nuck: All it is is a ncie wrapper
[20:09] jesusabdullah: Aikar: browserify does that now
[20:09] Aikar: jesusabdullah: thought so
[20:09] aaronblohowiak: Nuck: that only works if people use var appropriately

[21:18] Lingerance: TheJH: https://github.com/mranney/node_pcap
[21:18] jellosea: how do i catch asynchronous stuff?
[21:18] CoverSlide: you'd have to write the try/catch in your callback
[21:18] TheJH: Lingerance, I think that can't send stuff
[21:18] TheJH: jellosea, you use error events and event handlers
[21:18] melcher_ has joined the channel
[21:19] jellosea: TheJH: can you point me to an example/docs on how to do that

[21:19] CoverSlide: jellosea .on('error',cb)
[21:19] TheJH: jellosea, see the docs

[21:20] TheJH: inside the callback... then try/catch
[21:20] jellosea: where in the docs?
[21:20] TheJH: sorry, forget it... if it's inside your callback, I'd use try/catch

[21:23] dgathright has joined the channel

[21:30] TheEmpath: this is all fine and well, but this poses problems with acknowledgements
[21:33] jellosea: how do i catch this error http://pastie.org/2651975 i tried server.on ('error',...    but it doesn't catch it
