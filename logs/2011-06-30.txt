[00:11] industrial: Why does npm install modules into ./node_modules ? Is there no systemwide? I don't remember having this before.
[00:11] isaacs: industrial: npm help folders
[00:11] mikey_p: industrial: that's new with npm > 1.0
[00:11] jerrysv: new and awesome
[00:12] mikey_p: use -g for global, but for most apps you probably want to use node_modules
[00:12] industrial: right
[00:12] sethetter has joined the channel
[00:12] mikey_p: makes managing dependencies soo much easier
[00:12] ggg: there seems to be good oauth client modules, but how do i get a oauth server / producer unique for my app ?
[00:12] industrial: mikey_p: yeah, i love virtualenv/rvm too so :)
[00:14] jerrysv: ggg: if you find an answer for that, there are a lot of others looking as well
[00:14] jerrysv: ggg: so please share
[00:15] ggg: so how do you get a authentication service with nodejs???

[00:19] ggg: i dont want to sound arrogant or anything, why is node so popular if there is nothing to provide such a basic need for a web application?
[00:19] industrial: I used to use node-supervisor, but I see that it keeps restarting my app if it crashes. I'd rather have it restart after crashes only when the file is saved again. I don't see that possible with supervisor --help. Is there another module that can do it? I wonder what people are using :)

[00:22] Murvin: ggg:  i learn it and  did it yesterday.  very straight forward. :)

[00:22] ggg: any good links?
[00:22] Murvin: ggg: nono. this is very simple.     let me get u a link
[00:23] GriffenJBS: I'm trying socket.io, but I don't see socket.io.js that seems to be used on the client side, where is that?
[00:23] Lorentz: GriffenJBS: It is served as part of the server
[00:24] ParadoxQuine has joined the channel
[00:25] GriffenJBS: So it is not a static file I can place on a http server?

[00:25] Murvin: ggg: and this one:  github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/master/examples/basicAuth.js
[00:26] jerrysv: ggg: do you specifically need to be an oauth provider?
[00:26] mikeal has joined the channel
[00:26] AntelopeSalad_: griffen, i believe you can put it where ever you want because they have a cdn for the latest stable version
[00:26] Murvin: and these examples use login & password inside the code.. you can make it connect to DB (.e.g redis or mongo).
[00:26] jerrysv: ggg: there are oauth consumers written for node
[00:26] ggg: nooo ... something i can run on my server, without any thrid party
[00:27] Murvin: ggg: u just need some basic authentication, right?  look at these two links.
[00:27] ggg: perfect, thank you very much
[00:28] GriffenJBS: AntelopeSalad_: I haven't seen a live example so I've missed that
[00:28] nornagon has joined the channel
[00:28] ggg: and yes, i only want basic authentication, where I dont need any other third party in process such as openid or oauth based providers (twitter, facebook, google...etC)
[00:28] Murvin: ggg:  u welcome.   i have created one that get user login & password from database, and set different privilege.  let me know if you need help.
[00:29] ggg: does it include session handling...? 
[00:29] Murvin: ggg: yes.   
[00:29] mcluskydodallas has joined the channel
[00:29] ggg: ok, thx, ill give it a shot :P
[00:30] Murvin: ggg:  when you create the server:  express.createServer( .....  express.session({secret:'any string
[00:30] Murvin: '});
[00:31] Murvin: ggg: then u will have the session management.
[00:31] ggg: i guess ill have to intgrate express :P
[00:31] perlmonkey2 has joined the channel

[01:23] gtramont1na: Hi all. Question I have related to NPM ( maybe isaacs can help ) - I'm building a webapp and in my CI environment I need some of the dependencies to be installed as global (the module 'Jake', for instance). Can I inform something to npm so it installs whatever needed as global?
[01:24] isaacs: gtramont1na: why do you need your dependency to be global?
[01:24] fr0stbyte has joined the channel
[01:25] gtramont1na: isaacs: so, in my CI enviroment, I want to run the unit tests. So I have Jake as a dependency and I have to call 'jake test:unit'
[01:25] clifton has joined the channel
[01:25] isaacs: gtramont1na: put this in your package.json file:   "scripts" : { "test" : "jake test:unit" }
[01:25] isaacs: gtramont1na: then have your CI thingie run `npm test1`
[01:25] isaacs: *npm test
[01:25] isaacs: (no "1")
[01:26] gtramont1na: isaacs: : Right, but then it fails, because there is no such command 'jake'
[01:26] isaacs: gtramont1na: yeah there is :)
[01:26] KUHRT_: does anyone know of a sweet strategy to tackle front-end form generation/validation in a backbone/express context?
[01:27] isaacs: gtramont1na: jake is installed in ./node_modules/.bin/jake, which is the first item in the PATH when running npm scripts
[01:27] JoshC1 has joined the channel
[01:27] clifton: anyone know of someone with experience with LDAP authentication over nodejs? https://github.com/joewalnes/node-ldapauth is all i can find.
[01:27] isaacs: gtramont1na: you could also have your CI thingie do `./node_modules/.bin/jake test:unit` if you prefer
[01:27] eyesUnclouded has joined the channel
[01:28] CarterA: isaacs:  I may be extraordinarily dense, but is there a way to update npm itself using npm? Or do I just run the curl thing again?
[01:29] gtramont1na has joined the channel
[01:29] isaacs: CarterA: you can run the curl thing again.  but it's also possible to `npm update npm -g` or `npm install npm -g`.  that breaks with npm 1.0 <=1.0.13 or so

[07:28] hackband has joined the channel
[07:28] mobius-: node.js supports chunk-encoded http but I haven't heard them being used for uploading
[07:28] mlu: i.e. have a chunk queue and you just send chunks of, say, 1MB, at a time
[07:29] mlu: well, if you can upload a file via HTTP, why can't you accept such an upload via node.js?
[07:29] markwubben has joined the channel

[09:09] GriffenJBS: lack of documentation, fallback I don't need/can't use, layered over other modules, so the errors are buried in them and harder to debug
[09:10] `3rdEden: Yes the documention is a sore point
[09:10] tuhoojabotti: Indeed.
[09:10] `3rdEden: But I'm working on that atm
[09:10] tuhoojabotti: https://gist.github.com/1045566 <- example of good documentation. :P
[09:10] GriffenJBS: maybe I'm using it wrong, but I can't check the API to verify
[09:11] `3rdEden: GriffenJBS thanks for your input, now I know what we should work on :)
[09:11] GriffenJBS: cute pig, bacon makes me hungry
[09:11] tuhoojabotti: :O)
[09:11] tuhoojabotti: It's part of the documentation.
[09:12] GriffenJBS: Pascal/Delphi?
[09:12] GriffenJBS: wait basic
[09:12] tuhoojabotti: That's CoolBasic ;D The language I learned when I was 10, must not let the skills go away. :P
[09:13] GriffenJBS: it's been ... decades since I last read those

[09:15] tuhoojabotti: It's quite unknown, finnish and nice finnish community. :P
[09:15] Benjie: GriffenJBS, I just rolled my own. I now have a single socket that serves a custom protocol but also handles HTTP/WebSockets if necessary to wrap the custom protocol. (e.g. switch *\n for \x00*\xff and add the relevant headers)
[09:16] GriffenJBS: Benjie: I'm trying hard not to roll my own, I'm starting to feel like RMS
[09:17] Benjie: What I really want to do is get the first line of the request and if it's HTTP hand it off to the http module, otherwise handle it myself. But I can't see how to do that
[09:18] GriffenJBS: Benjie: socket.io does that with express, but I didn't dig into it too much
[09:19] `3rdEden: tuhoojabotti socket.io's code is also annoted with JSDoc :)
[09:19] tuhoojabotti: I don't think my doc is any standard. :P
[09:19] `3rdEden: but we don't have pigs :(

[09:38] SubStack: javascript won't judge you
[09:38] shachaf: Shame won't do you any good.
[09:38] shachaf: You're seeing different styles because there are different styles.
[09:38] tuhoojabotti: Skola: Use JSLint. :P

[09:38] shachaf: No style is wrong (except for anything different from how I like it :-) ).
[09:38] tuhoojabotti: SubStack: I do that too! Mind me.
[09:39] Skola: alright, good to know
[09:39] tuhoojabotti: Everyone should have their own coding style. :)
[09:39] tuhoojabotti: I approve that.
[09:39] tuhoojabotti: but something should be banned like commas before ;D
[09:39] tuhoojabotti: it's just eww.
[09:40] shachaf: Commas before?
[09:40] tuhoojabotti: [ lol
[09:40] tuhoojabotti: , lul]
[09:40] shachaf: Oh, Haskell-style.
[09:40] shachaf: That's a great style for multi-line arrays.
[09:40] Skola: yep
[09:40] Skola: I'll stick to Haskell style in general then
[09:41] tuhoojabotti: Eww you guys. ;)
[09:41] jonaslund: there should be a strict list mode
[09:41] SubStack: I don't do leading commas in haskell

[09:41] SubStack: not that I feel strongly or anything
[09:41] tuhoojabotti: You don't do Haskell, it's JS :u

[09:41] jonaslund: ?
[09:42] Skola: ie. in CoffeeScript: arr.reduce = (xs:x) -> //something   &   [1, 2, 3] etc
[09:42] tuhoojabotti: jonaslund: Yes.
[09:42] jonaslund: granted the ways of JS makes it hard to disallow things like that but it can be annoying when it happens :(
[09:42] shachaf: jonaslund: The missing comma is would presumably cause a parse error?
[09:42] jonaslund: shachaf: nope. runtime error
[09:42] jonaslund: what happens is that the array [{objA},{objB}] gets an array access with the {objC} as index
[09:43] Skola: lol
[09:43] jonaslund: actually
[09:43] shachaf: Oh, I guess there's that.
[09:43] altamic has joined the channel
[09:43] jonaslund: that gives your list an undefined entry
[09:43] jonaslund: not even an direct runtime error

[09:43] shachaf: Just use a sane language and you'll be fine. :-)

[09:44] kbni: Skola: I'm of the opinion that "predefined" objects/dicts are usually useful to be read in an easy way, so I usually align mine

[09:45] Skola: oops, I'm too brainwashed with Haskell
[09:45] Skola: I mean (xs,x)
[09:45] Skola: normally one would probably use spaces after the comma there
[09:45] aliem has joined the channel
[09:46] Skola: but with a lot of functional programming I don't care for my argument names
[09:46] Ezku\: my haskell fu isn't very strong at all, but doesn't xs:x mean the argument is a list with xs its head and x the tail?
[09:46] Ezku\: so the coffeescript equivalent would be ([xs, x...]) :)
[09:46] Skola: yeah that's right
[09:47] Ezku\: wow, seems I do know at least something.
[09:47] Skola: I wish coffeescript would allow for [1,5..20]

[09:49] Ezku\: I have developed a serious aversion to syntactic peculiarities in several FP languages such as Haskell, which tends to hinder my studies of them...
[09:50] Skola: once you 'get' them, you'll be thankful : P
[09:51] Ezku\: i think i'm familiar with the concepts and could readily apply them at least to a degree, were it not for the syntax
[09:52] Skola: you mean the [1,3..20] syntax?
[09:52] Ezku\: no, I mean FP
[09:53] Skola: which syntactic peculiarities do you mean though
[09:53] Skola: most of it is pretty straightforward

[15:13] indutny: Gigawatt: https://github.com/indutny/bar see there for further details
[15:13] Guest33280: i usually just have a global "app"
[15:13] Guest33280: because
[15:13] Guest33280: wrapping is really lame
[15:13] bradleymeck: tj its not unfortunate, its explicit :(

[15:13] v8bot:  indutny has taken a beer from Guest33280. Guest33280 now has -1 beers.
[15:14] bradleymeck: -1 to no wrap, implicit variables for context that pollute the global context...
[15:14] Gigawatt: ahhh, so just export then initialize with a global variable
[15:14] Gigawatt: thanks, ill try that wauy
[15:14] Gigawatt: way*
[15:14] Guest33280: bradleymeck agreed, but it's unfortunate when you have to pass "app" down 10 modules
[15:14] indutny: Gigawatt: using global vars is not a best way for that

[15:14] Guest33280: it's best practices vs killing yourself
[15:14] indutny: Guest33280: require('module1').init(app) ?
[15:15] indutny: Guest33280: what is the problem with that?
[15:15] bradleymeck: guest33280 but you break the ability to directly call apis from modules often (we have a couple clis that would break w/ nowrap)
[15:15] Guest33280: doesn't hurt to have a global if it's in your own app, and not in a lib
[15:15] indutny: or store constructors and wrappers in modules
[15:15] Guest33280: indutny it sucks
[15:15] Guest33280: then in that module you pass it down again
[15:15] indutny: Guest33280: really? :)
[15:15] Guest33280: and again
[15:15] Guest33280: and again
[15:15] bradleymeck: cut and paste is hard
[15:15] indutny: Guest33280: something wrong about your app design
[15:15] indutny: I'm using instances and classes everywhere
[15:15] Draggor: Or use a doto() function
[15:15] bradleymeck: especially when you end up breaking require of your app for programatic use otherwise
[15:15] indutny: so if I need something global - I'll use parent instance's method
[15:16] Guest33280: for example all of a sudden you need to get the return value of cluster() deep down in the require()s
[15:16] taf2: hey guys, so i'm working on a crawler scrapper and this might be a bit over kill but the arch is kind of cool... i use node.js + phantomjs... node.js running express is the master backed by mongodb... it uses child process to spawn phantomjs that then uses sizzle library to extra meaning ful text from the crawled pages... and post status back to node.js
[15:16] Guest33280: then you just keep passing more shit to require(foo)()
[15:16] Gigawatt: Like this? https://gist.github.com/1056446

[15:18] lukstr: omes: looks like it's defined in the test suite
[15:18] tjholowaychuk: nothing is wrong with a global in YOUR app
[15:18] tjholowaychuk: global in libs == very lame
[15:18] indutny: tjholowaychuk: I don't think so
[15:18] lukstr: just not in the actual library :)
[15:18] tjholowaychuk: in app == who cares
[15:18] indutny: tjholowaychuk: is there any big difference between app and lib?
[15:19] indutny: I think app itself should be a simple binary file #!/usr/bin/env
[15:19] tjholowaychuk: require('./foo')(app)   module.exports = function(app){ ... require('./bar')(app) .. etc
[15:19] indutny: tjholowaychuk: with require of app module and calling one method of it
[15:19] tjholowaychuk: is really lame
[15:19] bradleymeck: as long as when i call require(x) where x is an app with a non-programmatic interface (web/ui/cli/etc) and it does not give me globals, thats ok, but breaking those 2 apart is harder than a simple wrapper
[15:19] indutny: tjholowaychuk: Was I talking about that?
[15:20] tjholowaychuk: that's what he wanted to know
[15:20] indutny: using globals is very unpredictable and ok only for small projects, IMHO
[15:20] tjholowaychuk: how to pass stuff down throughout modules
[15:20] tjholowaychuk: if not documented, sure
[15:20] tjholowaychuk: one global wont kill you
[15:20] bradleymeck: ie we have several nested cli's that use the programmatic interfaces to do things that would be difficult from chaining child_process.spawn
[15:20] indutny: tjholowaychuk: '$' ?
[15:20] indutny: hehe :)
[15:20] indutny: $.myData ={};
[15:21] bradleymeck: anyway, this argument is fruitful and has never been had before
[15:21] indutny: I'll create a patch for node.js that will initialize the global object $
[15:21] indutny: global.$ = {};
[15:21] indutny: so everybody won't junkify my global
[15:21] tjholowaychuk: not in libs

[15:22] indutny: tjholowaychuk: I don't know, really. I think that app should follow same conventions as module
[15:22] indutny: and a good app looks like a module

[15:23] indutny: library
[15:23] tjholowaychuk: in certain respects yes
[15:23] tjholowaychuk: maybe you wont feel the pain until you do a large node app

[15:28] Draggor: That I get, yeah.
[15:28] tjholowaychuk: im not saying all libs, but most libs REALLY dont need _ as a dep

[15:33] radiodario: bradleymeck: yeah but i wanted to make it programmatically. cheers tho.
[15:34] mkrecny: JSON.parsing a given collection of objects - sometimes the parser chokes throwing Unexpected token ILLEGAL- sometimes it doesn't - same collection
[15:34] radiodario: i'm writing my own function.

[15:37] tbranyen: but now that i think of it, stringify makes more sense ?
[15:37] bshumate has joined the channel
[15:37] tjholowaychuk: brianc yeah just depends on the size o the app
[15:37] tjholowaychuk: of*
[15:37] tjholowaychuk: ours is huge
[15:37] brianc: tjholowaychuk: totes
[15:37] tjholowaychuk: and we utilize settings down fairly deep in the require()s
[15:37] tjholowaychuk: at times
[15:37] tjholowaychuk: and tons of other stuff
[15:38] bradleymeck: ours is getting there, but we mostly work in the CLI world, so being able to require eachother is nice
[15:38] brianc: I wish there was a semi-"standard" logging library so peeps could use it in their libraries 
[15:38] brianc: one thing nice about .NET...pretty much EVERYONE uses log4net so most open source libraries are logging the same way you are
[15:39] lukegalea: brianc: I feel similarly, but I don't think something as heavy as log4j or log4net would be needed. Something like Rails would work for me.
[15:39] tjholowaychuk: do we have something in npm like sloccount for js?

[15:40] brianc: yeah totally, i don't need heavy
[15:41] lukegalea: brianc: I guess we better go write it ;)

[15:45] tjholowaychuk: yeah, i prefer only the server output to stdio
[15:46] Kai__ has joined the channel
[15:46] lukstr: exactly, freopen makes wonderful logging possible with very little effort, and all other loggers are implicitly built ontop of it
[15:46] tjholowaychuk: they should all be configurable though i would think

[16:18] tjholowaychuk: which looks ok but not very flexible
[16:18] Gigawatt: never worked with rails :(
[16:19] Gigawatt: basically that function is inside a file called index.js, and when the user goes to /index/method, the callback for 'method' is called inside a context with tools and helpers for Models, Libraries etc

[16:28] level09: express seems to be the most popular
[16:28] indutny: tjholowaychuk: it's fat
[16:28] tjholowaychuk: it's a tiny library
[16:28] pigmej: tjholowaychuk: you know what I mean :))
[16:28] indutny: tjholowaychuk: :)
[16:28] tjholowaychuk: connect is much larger
[16:28] level09: I came across the webservice module as well
[16:28] pigmej: express requires connec t;)
[16:28] tjholowaychuk: level09: https://github.com/visionmedia/express/blob/master/examples/web-service/app.js
[16:28] indutny: level09: webservice is good too
[16:28] tjholowaychuk: pigmej yeah, and connect exists, to serve express
[16:28] pigmej: tjholowaychuk: express is awesome... but for rest interface?...
[16:29] tjholowaychuk: yes
[16:29] tjholowaychuk: that's what it's for

[16:29] tjholowaychuk: lol
[16:29] tjholowaychuk: use C
[16:29] level09: tjholowaychuk: great thanks
[16:29] tjholowaychuk: faster
[16:29] brianc: haha
[16:29] pigmej: tjholowaychuk: depends where ;]
[16:29] indutny: use ASM
[16:29] indutny: faster
[16:29] tjholowaychuk: there you go
[16:29] tjholowaychuk: asm it is
[16:29] pigmej: tjholowaychuk: I didn't say that express is slow ;)
[16:29] ekryski: lol. so stupid

[16:31] tjholowaychuk: lists, hashes, blah blah
[16:31] pigmej: in one of our projects we needed fast http routing
[16:32] pigmej: escort was much faster than express
[16:32] pigmej: in that scenario
[16:32] unvamp: http://redis.io/commands
[16:32] tjholowaychuk: lol...
[16:32] pigmej: where 'much faster' was ~20-30% :-)
[16:32] tjholowaychuk: faster is irrelevant if you dont have a bottleneck, and that's no way to scale regardless
[16:32] tjholowaychuk: I'll use C because it's faster
[16:32] tjholowaychuk: it'll take twice as long to write

[16:34] pigmej: for sure express has much more functions etc
[16:35] unvamp: haha
[16:35] tjholowaychuk: it'll be faster until you throw in a db query and that takes 100x more time haha
[16:35] unvamp: urright
[16:35] tjholowaychuk: along with other logic
[16:35] pigmej: tjholowaychuk: sure
[16:35] pigmej: ;-)
[16:35] pigmej: that's why I said 'in that scenario' ;)
[16:35] tjholowaychuk: brianc yeah exactly, routing will NEVER be the bottleneck
[16:35] tjholowaychuk: was "hello world" your scenario?
[16:35] pigmej: tjholowaychuk: not really :)
[16:35] pigmej: but some long url routing
[16:35] tjholowaychuk: "hello"
[16:35] tjholowaychuk: ?
[16:36] tjholowaychuk: haha
[16:36] pigmej: tjholowaychuk: well, the db that I used for it takes 'nothing'

[16:46] tjholowaychuk: nah
[16:46] tjholowaychuk: i might leave router in, but dumb it down some more

[16:47] tjholowaychuk: i kept extending it for express
[16:47] colinclark_ has joined the channel
[16:47] ekryski: just taking over the router functionality?
[16:47] ekryski: fair enough
[16:47] mapleman1 has joined the channel
[16:47] tjholowaychuk: and frankly connect is meant to support frameworks, not used stand-alone other than small cases
[16:47] tjholowaychuk: the only reason i might leave a simple version
[16:47] tjholowaychuk: is for things like auth middleware
[16:47] tjholowaychuk: which still could utilize path-based routing
[16:47] tjholowaychuk: not positive if they do right now, I assume so
[16:48] ekryski: ya. other than really basic servers. ya.  I've been playing with everyauth.
[16:48] tjholowaychuk: I'll have to do some review
[16:48] brianc: everyauth is nice
[16:48] brianc: could not get connect-auth to work

[17:05] dgathright has joined the channel
[17:06] ekryski: are you using jade templating?
[17:06] Gigawatt: yea
[17:06] ekryski: you can set it as a local for layout
[17:06] ekryski: which is the main layout template
[17:07] Gigawatt: what you mean, neer used express before
[17:07] Gigawatt: never*
[17:07] Gigawatt: i was thinking something like: express.set("view data",config.meta);
[17:07] Gigawatt: so that it's available for all pages
[17:08] tjholowaychuk: Gigawatt: app.set('foo', 'bar')  #{settings.foo}
[17:08] Gigawatt: thanks
[17:08] ekryski: how it works is you have "layout" template which is the common one across all pages.  Then you can have other templates for specific pages.  You can place your meta data in the layout template
[17:08] tjholowaychuk: there are many more ways but that's what I would suggest for general settings
[17:09] samuelj has joined the channel
[17:10] samuelj: Hey guys, I have a quick question. What are your thoughts on using heroku or such like to run an app server, but then a separate static server that serves a skeleton page and loads some client-side js, which then pulls in everything from the app server. Would this add extra latency? Should I avoid this? And what are the other options?
[17:11] ekryski: tjhollowaychuk: with Jade can you load dynamic javascript or css files depending on which page you are on?
[17:12] brianc: samuelj: that's very common, it's called a "CDN" or asset server.  You'll need to make sure they're on the same domain (but will require using different sub-domain)
[17:12] onr has joined the channel
[17:13] dilvie: brianc: I don't think that's what he's talking about.
[17:13] brianc: oh
[17:13] samuelj: I think it is...
[17:14] samuelj: cdn == content deliver network ?
[17:14] dilvie: samuelj: I believe that the future of web apps are going to be servers spitting out static DOM while the client-side JavaScript fetches content from an API server. Is that what you mean?
[17:14] brianc: samuelj: correct
[17:14] dilvie: oh, maybe I read it wrong.
[17:14] samuelj: dilvie yeah that's what i meant
[17:14] samuelj: sorry, i didn't know what cdn was
[17:14] bwinton has joined the channel
[17:14] jeroen| has joined the channel
[17:14] Poetro1 has joined the channel
[17:14] dilvie: cdn is content delivery network. It's not really the same concept. Content delivery network is just one way to serve up your static content.
[17:14] brianc: samuelj: they make your site faster generally, and especially if it's a good CDN and your visitors are coming from geographically far away
[17:15] samuelj: my question really is, if my app server, that spits out json, is on heroku, what should serve the initial skeleton?
[17:15] samuelj: a separate heroku instance?
[17:15] samuelj: just a plain old nginx instance on some other server?
[17:15] dilvie: samuelj: You could easily combine a content delivery network with the client-side application concept to make everything a bit faster.
[17:16] guark has joined the channel
[17:16] dilvie: Samuelj: Akamai, Amazon Cloudfront, etc...
[17:16] dilvie: ;)
[17:16] samuelj: or should node.js just serve the static page in the same instance of the app?
[17:16] samuelj: does that make sense?
[17:17] brianc: samuelj: until you need massive scale just serve from node
[17:17] dilvie: samuelj: at the app development stage, you don't really need to answer that question. It doesn't matter what you serve static content with. You can optimize that process later using a variety of router / server combinations.
[17:17] brianc: samuelj: node (properly configured) is a super fast static file server
[17:17] dilvie: I serve my static content with node until it's time to scale.
[17:18] samuelj: ok
[17:18] dilvie: But it certainly makes sense to serve that content with a different server instance. =)
[17:18] Renegade001 has joined the channel
[17:18] samuelj: ah right
[17:18] samuelj: so for now
[17:18] samuelj: my node app can run on heroku, in one instance
[17:19] cafesofie has joined the channel
[17:19] samuelj: and another instance could serve the initial static page, pulling in the data from the app instance
[17:19] samuelj: and i could even use node to serve that static file
[17:20] adrianmg has joined the channel
[17:20] samuelj: but why should i use two different instances?
[17:20] dilvie: yeah
[17:20] samuelj: because i can optimise?
[17:20] robi42 has joined the channel
[17:20] dilvie: yeah
[17:20] brianc: samuelj: just use 1 instance
[17:20] samuelj: right
[17:21] samuelj: and a request to the app could return the static page
[17:21] samuelj: wait
[17:21] samuelj: hang on
[17:21] samuelj: two answers here
[17:21] robot_jesus has joined the channel
[17:21] dilvie: when it's time to scale, use 2 instances to start. =)
[17:21] samuelj: i like the two instance approach, as it's closer to what i'd do when trying to scale
[17:21] samuelj: sound ok?
[17:21] dilvie: worry about which technology you use to serve the static content when you start to get a lot of traffic. =)
[17:21] samuelj: yeah, i just like to do things properly :)
[17:21] dilvie: sounds ok to me. =)
[17:22] samuelj: thanks for the advice guys!

[18:15] _beau: i had that error when the code was creating multiple listeners to the same event
[18:15] christkv has joined the channel
[18:15] _beau: make sure to remove the listener before adding it to the same event again
[18:15] scoates: right; all of my plugins listen for the events
[18:15] _beau: same events?
[18:15] christkv: hey anyone having problems publish with npm ?
[18:16] christkv: It's refusing too
[18:16] christkv: and wiping out older versions
[18:16] scoates: _beau: different objects, same events, yeah

[18:23] christkv: @isaacs https://gist.github.com/1056845
[18:24] isaacs: christkv: ok, don't give a name to publish.
[18:24] isaacs: christkv: just go into the folder, and type `npm publish`
[18:25] isaacs: christkv: if you give it a name, that's for republishing something that's already published, which you probably don't want to do.
[18:25] christkv: what is is trying to do when I add a name ?
[18:25] christkv: ah interesting enough
[18:25] christkv: if I do --force it will delete the latest version but still fail
[18:25] isaacs: christkv: it's saying, "What's this mongo thing?  Oh, it's mongo@latest, which is mongo@09.6. Lemme just download that, and then publish it."
[18:26] christkv: oh I see :)
[18:26] isaacs: christkv: you almost never want to do that.  i have that functionality there mostly so that i can easily re-publish over things when an npm bug causes invalid stuff ot be in the package.
[18:26] christkv: so that it worked in the past is just luck 
[18:26] isaacs: usually what you really wanna do is just "npm publish" in the package folder, or `npm publish ../some/folder`
[18:27] isaacs: christkv: i'm pretty sure that never worked in the past.  you probably didn't type "mongo" on the command line.

[18:34] scoates: the docs don't seem to think so. http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.7/api/events.html#emitter.setMaxListeners  ... is this not require('events').EventEmitter.setMaxListeners ?

[18:53] pjacobs: mrryanjohnston, in fact, how about this: blogpost.comments.push({title: req.body.commentbody});
[18:54] kuya: isaacs: thanks 
[18:54] pjacobs: mrryanjohnston, another way would be to make an instance of Comments, and passing it as a var. Might be the cleaner approach
[18:55] SubStack: kuya: socket.io just got browserify support recently
[18:56] kuya: SubStack: do i need to use the git version of one of them?
[18:56] SubStack: which just involved adding a "browserify" : "./somepath/to/the/browser/file.js"
[18:56] SubStack: to the package.json
[18:56] SubStack: so you can require('socket.io') browser-side now
[18:56] kuya: thats what id like
[18:56] kuya: is it committed in any branch?
[18:56] kuya: fork/branch/something

[18:59] hink has joined the channel
[18:59] kuya: so i need to npm install socket.io-client or something and require('socket.io-client') ?
[18:59] kuya: or..
[19:00] isaacs: kuya: oh, yeah, i think socket.io changed its naming convention around a little bit recently.  rauchg you around?
[19:00] SubStack: oh sweet, yeah this: $ npm view socket.io-client browserify
[19:00] SubStack: ./dist/socket.io.js
[19:00] isaacs: hooray for extensible metadata!
[19:01] kuya: ACTION blinks 
[19:01] isaacs: we chould call json XJSON because it's eXtensible!~

[19:01] isaacs: kuya: yeah, npm view is probably my favorite.
[19:01] kuya: uurrrmmm
[19:01] kuya: ACTION still hasnt got a clue what he's doing 
[19:02] rauchg: kuya
[19:02] rauchg: socket.io-client is both the browser client and node client, although the node part is still under construction
[19:03] rauchg: socket.io is the node server which also ships the client (that you can reference through <script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js">, since the request gets intercepted by socket.io)
[19:03] rauchg: you can still bundle it manually, use browserify, etc etc

[19:03] rauchg: socket.io used to be the client, and socket.io-node the server
[19:04] kuya: aha i see

[19:04] mkrecny: do y'all use JSON (stringify and parse) ?

[19:05] jetienne: onr: it doesnt work. it doesnt even cr'eate a node_modules directory
[19:05] kuya: rauchg: so actually in my browser script i just want to do something like socketio = require('socket.io-client') ?
[19:06] SubStack: yep!
[19:06] rauchg: then you should use browserify
[19:06] kuya: aha!
[19:06] rauchg: if you want client side require
[19:07] kuya: i have been using it which lead me on this mission to see if i could just require socket-io :)
[19:07] mcluskydodallas has joined the channel
[19:08] gustavowt has joined the channel
[19:08] SubStack: kuya: you could do browserify({ require : { 'socket-io' : 'socket.io-client' }})

[19:09] kuya: except a plain require doesnt find socket.io-client presumably because its a requirement off socket.io...

[20:32] phpnode: which is the most widely used memcached client?
[20:32] bnoordhuis: dnunes: variables are references to an object, not copies of the object
[20:33] dnunes: bnoordhuis: But I'm using "new <name>();"
[20:33] tbranyen: phpnode: telnet
[20:33] dnunes: Like... var a = function () { }; a.prototype._b = '';
[20:33] dnunes: var test1 = new a(); test1._b = 'test number 1'; var test2 = new a();
[20:33] colinclark has joined the channel
[20:33] dnunes: In this case, the "test2._b" is starting with the "test number 1" value.
[20:33] dnunes: Is it the expected behavior?
[20:34] phpnode: tbranyen: ok, which is the recommended memcached client library to use with node.js ? :P
[20:34] isaacs: dnunes: in general, you'll get better results by sharing a gist to some actual code, rather than describing it

[20:36] mjr_: `3rdEden: do you do any client-side sharding in your memcached thing?
[20:36] blkcat: minimalist: check the mongodb docs :)
[20:36] minimalist: blkcat: thanks
[20:36] jbroman: dnunes: Most likely, you're using one of the methods which modifies a string (or other data) in-place.
[20:36] `3rdEden: mjr_ yes I use a hashring for that
[20:36] jbroman: Don't.
[20:36] mandric has joined the channel

[20:40] `3rdEden: antirez is probably having to much fun with lua ;)
[20:40] dnunes: isaacs: https://gist.github.com/1057180
[20:40] `3rdEden: and jemalloc, zmalloc
[20:40] dnunes: isaacs: If my instance have a property with the type "string", it's ok. When I have an array, it's getting shared among the instances.
[20:40] jbroman: dnunes: Only one array instance is being created.
[20:41] jbroman: dnunes: One simple solution is to use "this._elements = []" in the a constructor.
[20:41] patrikkarlin has joined the channel
[20:41] isaacs: dnunes: yeah, because objects have identity
[20:41] Chani: ok, the number of callbacks in my code is making the indentation ridiculous. what do you guys do to counter that?

[20:42] jbroman: Chani: Name them, and refer to the names?
[20:42] dnunes: jbroman: hmmm... got it.
[20:42] isaacs: dnunes: simple pattern fix: only put methods on the prototype.
[20:42] isaacs: dnunes: put non-shared data members on "this" in the constructor
[20:42] Chani: jbroman: what if they need access to a var from the previous section?
[20:43] Chani: oh, I guess I could declare it earlier
[20:43] dnunes: isaacs: So, actually the string is being shared as well, right?
[20:43] dnunes: isaacs: Or not?
[20:43] isaacs: Chani: Write multiple functions that each take a cb.  Then just do   nextPart(arg, arg, arg, cb)  and pass the same callback down that you got.
[20:43] jbroman: dnunes: It is, it just so happens that there aren't any methods on string that do in-place modification.
[20:43] isaacs: dnunes: it is, but when you set the string, your'e overwriting the whole thing.
[20:43] jbroman: (They all return a new string as a result.)
[20:43] isaacs: v8: function Foo () {};  Foo.prototype.x = ["y"];  a = new Foo();  b = new Foo();  a.x = ["z"];  b.x
[20:43] v8bot: isaacs: SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[20:43] dnunes: Yeap. I used a stupid example on the string, hahaha.
[20:43] isaacs: v8: function Foo () {};  Foo.prototype.x = ["y"];  a = new Foo();  b = new Foo();  a.x = ["z"];  b.x

[20:55] tenumm: isaacs: rhdoenges: :) 
[20:55] mandric: ok
[20:55] `3rdEden: mjr_ I noticed that pquerna also created hashring module, but he depricated it

[20:59] mjr_: Closed source ATM, but I hope that change that soon.
[20:59] mjr_: I wish I could just get rid of it all and use native redis clustering.
[20:59] `3rdEden: writing to 2 sharks wouldn't be needed
[20:59] `3rdEden: as redis has build in support for replication
[21:00] mjr_: But you can't reliably have two nodes replicating into each other

[21:24] pquerna: https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/master/lib/middleware/logger.js
[21:24] pquerna: it looks like i need to revervse engineer the default fmt string somehow
[21:24] tjholowaychuk: pquerna: I have an open issue for adding logger.define() for extra tokens, and ideally pre-canned formats
[21:24] pquerna: ah
[21:25] tjholowaychuk: maybe connect.logger.define('token', val) and connect.logger.format('name'[, str])
[21:25] tjholowaychuk: to get/set
[21:25] voodootikigod has joined the channel
[21:26] pquerna: sure, that'd be fine.  Mostly wanted the 'default' to be defined in terms of the log fmt
[21:26] pquerna: so i could just copy the default fmt string, add my one more field
[21:26] tjholowaychuk: yup, i dont disagree that would be nicer
[21:26] tjholowaychuk: bit slower but meh
[21:26] pquerna: mmm
[21:26] pquerna: well you could pre-generate a closure

[21:35] sechrist: I'm unsure how to ensure sanity here when using a remote repository.
[21:35] tbranyen: sechrist: when you add a submodule it automatically checks out and stores at a specific revision
[21:35] tbranyen: i dunno where it stores that information, i've searched never found
[21:36] sechrist: basically I have a project that I'm working on with a few other developers, and I don't want to have to police their node modules folders for versions when express upgrades and such
[21:36] sechrist: manually anyway
[21:36] sechrist: seems like if I use git submodules, each person with a checkout of my project would be responsible for making sure all of their submodules are up to date
[21:36] Swizec has joined the channel
[21:36] mikey_p: yeah, git submodules are by default tied to a specific commit
[21:37] sechrist: yikes, so is there a better model, even if it's node specific?
[21:37] sechrist: I would try using NPM but the fact that it doesn't live inside of the project bothers me
[21:37] mikey_p: sechrist: no, they just to git submodule init and git submodule update when they checkout and they get the versions you committed
[21:37] mikey_p: sechrist: why not use a package.json in your project?
[21:38] mikey_p: and skip the git submodules (it is more pain than it is worth 90% of the time)
[21:38] sechrist: How does a package.json file grab dependencies for me?
[21:38] caolanm has joined the channel
[21:38] mikey_p: unless you're patching and contributing to your submodules
[21:38] bradleymeck_: .gitignore ./node_modules,  , use npm install for your deps (it can handle remote files)
[21:38] mikey_p: sechrist: npm will read the package.json in the current directory and install any dependencies (and specific versions) you specify
[21:39] sechrist: NPM lives in /usr for me
[21:39] sechrist: oh interesting
[21:39] mikey_p: so check your package.json into git
[21:39] mikey_p: sechrist: you need to use npm > 1.something
[21:39] bradleymeck_: git pull origin master && npm update
[21:39] sechrist: "npm install" in a directory with a package.json present?
[21:39] sechrist: or I'm not following I guess
[21:40] bradleymeck_: sechrist yes, set up the dependencies, `npm help json`.  `npm install` (no -g) will put it in your local directory (use npm >=1.0.0
[21:40] bradleymeck_: npm < 1.0 == bad juju now days
[21:41] sechrist: oh neat
[21:41] mikey_p: sechrist: put something like this in your myapp/ directory (where your .git dir is) http://paste.pocoo.org/show/425232/

[22:00] isaacs: javascript is rad.
[22:01] isaacs: andthe vm is crazy awesome
[22:01] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: hey, is there any reason why an object i put in the express session would have its methods stripped?  is there a json step or something?
[22:01] Gigawatt: it really get's to me sometimes that i can't just define a class and constructor and then extend another class, access like parent.method() instead of overriding :(
[22:01] SubStack: fuck classes
[22:01] broofa_ has joined the channel
[22:01] mjr_: The newer V8's seem a lot faster.  I'm excited to see them in node.
[22:01] Gigawatt: the vm is supaa

[22:01] shirro has joined the channel
[22:01] Gigawatt: link ?
[22:02] sechrist: mjr_: in what way? all around?
[22:02] isaacs: Gigawatt: it only takes about a 12 line helper function to get like 99% of what you like from class languages.
[22:02] isaacs: Gigawatt: npm docs inherits
[22:02] SubStack: Gigawatt: custom functionality is much better done with functions
[22:02] SubStack: isaacs: yep exactly
[22:02] tjholowaychuk: isaacs yeah
[22:02] SubStack: put the custom shit you might otherwise use inheritance for into higher-order functions
[22:02] tjholowaychuk: you can't rely on the memory store
[22:02] tjholowaychuk: that'll break
[22:02] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: really?
[22:02] mjr_: Well, it's hard to say.  It makes my programs run faster, and I haven't figured out exactly why.  It could be that crankshaft works on 64-bit, or it could be that buffer index code gets compiled.
[22:02] tjholowaychuk: if you use any other store
[22:02] mjr_: Either way, wins all around.
[22:02] tjholowaychuk: and using the memory store is not good for prod
[22:03] sechrist: neato
[22:03] Gigawatt: thinks like: Dog.super.apply(this); just seems so un-required 
[22:03] skm has joined the channel
[22:03] Gigawatt: function !== class && function !== method
[22:04] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: ok, so, let's say i'm using it... and i only have one server running.  any way to just save an object reference?  seems like a lot of overhead to be serializing just for a memory cache.
[22:04] ozalexo has joined the channel
[22:04] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: MemoryStore is just for testing and development (if even)
[22:04] odie5533 has joined the channel
[22:04] storrgie has joined the channel
[22:04] tjholowaychuk: and that's only if you dont care about losing the session when in dev
[22:04] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: well, i mean, it's just for sessions, right?  like, when you log out, it goes away
[22:05] tjholowaychuk: so it's basically only useful for a test env
[22:05] tjholowaychuk: yes
[22:05] tjholowaychuk: but redis cannot store methods
[22:05] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: should we take to #express?
[22:05] tjholowaychuk: in a session
[22:05] tjholowaychuk: yeah sure
[22:05] Dulak: i just cloned node from github, and get a build error when I run the make step of install: http://pastebin.com/muBajrZp
[22:05] mikey_p: i've taking to not storing whole objects in sessions, just the user ID
[22:06] mikey_p: and then always load that user on each request...maybe some extra overhead, but keeps logic around updating/saving users much simpler

[22:20] iammerrick has joined the channel
[22:21] rauchg has joined the channel
[22:21] mraleph: mjr_: 3.2 should have improved that a lot. but yeah. probably the only way to get very-very fast format for communication is to wire writer and especially reader directly into V8 internals.
[22:21] rpj8 has joined the channel
[22:22] storrgie has joined the channel
[22:22] mjr_: mraleph: yes, 3.2 did make JSON faster.  I'm pretty happy with how fast it runs now for just about everything
[22:22] mraleph: mjr_: people don't realize that natural closure based node.js style is not exactly the cheapest way to structure code.
[22:22] mjr_: node's HTTP client is still too slow.
[22:22] mjr_: Yeah, closure-ing around is really fun, but burns up GC like crazy.
[22:23] atmos has joined the channel
[22:24] atmos: did npm change where it installs modules recently ?
[22:24] mraleph: experimental GC we have tries to amortize GC cost by spreading work across many small steps. but still the less you allocate the better :-)
[22:24] atmos: or is there some env var i'm likely missing to specify where they should go?
[22:24] atmos: everything i install with npm is populdating ./node_modules
[22:24] mjr_: I squeezed about 10% more performance form node_redis by getting rid of arguments processing and replacing fn.apply() with a tiny anon fn to bind it.
[22:25] Prometheus: atmos: by default it does that, with -g it'll install them globally
[22:25] tjholowaychuk: mraleph: were you guys thinking of some sort of threaded GC ? swear I remember hearing that somewhere
[22:25] jarrads: @atmos yeah, the latest version of npm installs to node_modules in cwd by default
[22:25] tjholowaychuk: might have just been rumor
[22:25] atmos: Prometheus: jarrads ty much
[22:26] mjr_: mraleph: the surprising thing to me was that making an anonymous function allocates heap memory.  I mean, it's obvious in retrospect, but I didn't think about it at the time.
[22:26] isaacs: atmos: npm help folders
[22:26] bnoordhuis: mjr_: node's current http client uses a request queue, maybe that's where the slowness comes from?
[22:26] atmos: isaacs: definitely wouldn't have guessed that one :)
[22:26] atmos: besides wtf is a folder, they're directories!
[22:27] atmos: i can happily move along now that i know how to get the behavior, and the docs seem sufficient
[22:27] mjr_: bnoordhuis: creationix looked at that, but couldn't correlate lower throughput with queue depth.
[22:28] bnoordhuis: mjr_: if you have a test case, we can look at it
[22:29] mraleph: tjholowaychuk: I did some experiments with parallelizing stop-the-world mark-sweep collector. it worked pretty well. but we decided to persue different approach for now. 
[22:29] tjholowaychuk: ah ok cool, wasn't sure
[22:30] mjr_: bnoordhuis: I haven't reduced it to a simple test case yet, but it seems like something is slow with http clients, perhaps with agent.
[22:30] mraleph: tjholowaychuk: some thing are also relatively easy to make concurrent, so are hard. but again we decided to go first down the incremental road.
[22:30] mraleph: s/so/some/
[22:30] mjr_: bnoordhuis: we do more client connections than we do server connections, so we really notice how fast it goes under load.
[22:30] bnoordhuis: mjr_: don't get me started on the agent code :-/
[22:30] tjholowaychuk: makes sense
[22:30] mjr_: bnoordhuis: at peak times, we make over 5,000 client connections/sec across the cluster.
[22:31] mjr_: All using agent.
[22:31] JJMalina has joined the channel
[22:31] mraleph: mjr_: yeah arguments are also relatively expensive if you use them in the way that make V8 materialize them... 
[22:31] bnoordhuis: mjr_: is this related? https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/1176
[22:31] xeodox has joined the channel
[22:32] mjr_: bnoordhuis: it might be.  I think the general issue with agent is that if node is going to offer a connection pool abstraction, then it kind of needs to also handle retries when a kept-alive connection goes away.
[22:32] mjr_: Which is often this "socket hang up" case.
[22:33] mjr_: Under load, you are much more likely to try to re-use a connection that is about to go away
[22:33] bnoordhuis: mjr_: right, sounds like this: https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/1135
[22:34] chbrown has joined the channel
[22:34] mjr_: ahh yes, 1135.  An issue near and dear to me.

[22:36] bnoordhuis: mjr_: i have 1176 on my mental to do list - haven't been able to reproduce it yet though
[22:36] skapism: Hi, I'm trying to test my expressjs server using jasmine-node. But with zombie (and my personal small node.js client) I always get ECONNREFUSED. If I start the server not from within the spec file, it works. What could be the problem?
[22:37] tjholowaychuk: xeodox feel free to jump in #express i'll help
[22:37] skapism: I thought it might be a race conditino between the client and the server so I put the server into setTimeout and used asyncSpecDone() and asyncSpecWait() to make sure it gets started
[22:37] xeodox: @tjholowaychuk ok i'll see you in #express
[22:38] mjr_: 1135 is pretty easy to reproduce.  You can either use Riak as in my example, or you can write a simple TCP server that does HTTP, says it will keep the connection alive, but then drops it right away
[22:38] skapism: And the server gets started, I can curl while performing the tests...
[22:39] tjholowaychuk: skapism yeah probably just attempting to request before it's ready
[22:39] sechrist: What is the purpose of the 'layout' in these express templates?
[22:39] sechrist: I always tell it layout: false so I avoid the errors but I've never known what they are for
[22:40] fly-away has joined the channel
[22:40] tjholowaychuk: most apps use one or more layouts
[22:40] tjholowaychuk: to wrap the page templates
[22:40] sechrist: So it's like a base template?
[22:40] tjholowaychuk: you can do app.set('view options', { layout: false })
[22:40] tjholowaychuk: if you want
[22:40] tjholowaychuk: it's just a shell basically
[22:40] sechrist: I mean I don't understand their function
[22:40] bnoordhuis: mjr_: will try to look into it one of these days
[22:40] sechrist: like your basic html tags go in them, and then the blocks are from other templates?
[22:40] sechrist: kind of django-ish?
[22:41] tjholowaychuk: kinda, im not overly familiar with django
[22:41] tjholowaychuk: but basically <boilerplate stuff here>body(aka page template)</boilerplate>
[22:41] sechrist: ah I see
[22:41] tjholowaychuk: it's not perfect for ever use-case but most apps will have a few layouts and one that is used 80% of the time etc
[22:42] tjholowaychuk: or some not at all
[22:42] tjholowaychuk: really depends
[22:42] sechrist: tjholowaychuk: do you know of an example app on github off the top of your head?
[22:42] onr: isaacs: is your "how to module" article up-to-date?
[22:42] tjholowaychuk: sechrist ./examples in the express repo

[22:48] isaacs: Gigawatt: i chose to do that in npm, actually.  in node, i follow ryan's style

[23:11] sechrist: tjholowaychuk: in Django, the templating system allows you to overload a block set higher up in the chain, and use that blocks contents as a variable, so you can add script tags in the head for a specific view, for example.
[23:11] sechrist: I'm not seeing any nice way to do includes and stuff like this in express

[23:13] sechrist: I can set up partials I guess to get some of the inheritance that I want , I guess.

[23:57] Gigawatt: hey guys, in JS, if i pass a variable into a function  is it passed by reference so that outside the function it's modified as well ?
[23:57] maushu: Gigawatt, depends on the variable.
[23:58] maushu: If its a object, it's passed as reference, if it's a Number or String, it's passed by value.
[23:58] tjholowaychuk: Gigawatt not primitives
[23:58] Gigawatt: its a string
[23:58] maushu: It's by value.

[23:59] maushu: Kinda.
[23:59] maushu: The strings in javascript are immutable.
[23:59] maushu: But anyways, think of it as passing by value.
[23:59] Gigawatt: basically im creating an SMTP Mailer, now for it to be async i need to load the files async, so if i pass a message into a function do i need the function to pass the modified message back in the callback to work with or can i still you my variable from the parent scope
[23:59] Gigawatt: so pass it back after it's been modified
