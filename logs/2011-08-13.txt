[02:40] ale: stagas: then, how should I write the proxy?
[02:40] stagas: ale: why do you use the proxy for?

[02:43] mscdex: developers, developers, developers!
[02:43] stagas: ale: var app = express.createServer(); var io = require('socket.io').listen(app); app.listen(81); // this should work no?
[02:44] ale: stagas: yes, but if I combine it with expressjs it won't work
[02:45] stagas: ale: can't help you without some code
[02:45] stagas: ale: use gist.github.com
[02:45] matyr has joined the channel
[02:46] ale: stagas: I mean, with expressjs let's say I want to do io = require('socket.io').listen(app); app.listen(81); app.get('/web/:id'); -> Then, I'll have to access to localhost:81/web/12
[02:46] ckknight has joined the channel
[02:46] ale: stagas: Then with proxy I want to prevent the need of writing localhost:81, do you get me?
[02:47] stagas: ale: yeah, you can't do that if you have apache listening on 80
[02:47] ale: stagas: So what should I do?!
[02:48] stagas: ale: listen on a free ip or use a proxy behind apache and node, haproxy or whatever
[02:49] ale: stagas: holy...I didn't understand you
[02:49] chjj: or just dont use apache :)
[02:49] zilch has joined the channel
[02:49] clifton has joined the channel
[02:50] ale: Okey..what are you talking about guys? =)
[02:50] chjj: hes talking about a reverse proxy, something that can pass off connections to node
[02:50] ale: But how not to use apache?!
[02:51] chjj: killall apache
[02:51] chjj: ;)
[02:51] ale: Impossible, if I have html, php files
[02:51] ale: I can't stop apache!
[02:51] blueadept2: anyone made a multi-server node manager?

[02:52] Charuru has joined the channel
[02:52] ale: stagas: but http-node-proxy does not work?
[02:52] chjj: blueadept2: depends on what youre talking about, you might want something like cluster
[02:53] blueadept: chjj: i keep hearing about cluster, i need to check it out
[02:53] stagas: ale: it would, but you need to reconfigure apache to run on another port, so you can redirect requests to it using http-node-proxy listening on 80
[02:53] blueadept: i rolled my own using forever
[02:53] blueadept: but i'm looking for perhaps other options
[02:53] chjj: https://github.com/LearnBoost/cluster
[02:53] blueadept: did tj write this all?
[02:53] ale: stagas: But I have no problem of using another port rather than 80, the problem is that it won't make it work! So what should I do? I am stucked :S
[02:53] rfay has joined the channel
[02:54] chjj: yeah, tj used his superpowers to write it i think
[02:54] blueadept: how does that kid have time to write so many libs
[02:54] blueadept: i swear almost my entire node stack is either something tj made 
[02:55] blueadept: he needs some sort of medal
[02:55] random123: How is the performance of node_mysql compared to PHP's implimentation? PHP uses a .so file whereas node_mysql uses Node's require('net').Socket to send packets?
[02:55] tylergillies_ has left the channel
[02:55] stagas: ale: that's the problem, no two apps can bind on the same port. therefore you need to have an app listening on 80 and acting as a proxy to your other apps (apache, express etc) which should be listening on different ports to work
[02:56] JakeyChan has joined the channel
[02:56] BoarK has joined the channel
[02:56] chjj: random123: i imagine youre referring to felixge's binding?
[02:57] ale: stagas: oh!!! And how should I re-configure that? So then what happens if I access to my.page? It should proxy it it :80 right? In the case that we are using the proxy
[02:57] stagas: ale: if you use node on another port then all is fine you don't need a proxy
[02:57] chjj: i would imagine well, i havent benchmarked it, but felixge is pretty good at writing streaming parsers
[02:57] zilch has joined the channel
[02:58] ale: stagas: the problem is just this one: localhost/web/:id with expressjs, but I don't know in which port to make listen to!
[02:58] random123: chjj: Is there a difference between using a .so and using a socket?
[02:59] ale: stagas: I mean, in which port should I make expressjs to listen to?
[02:59] ale: stagas: so that I do not need to write on the url?
[03:00] chjj: random123: sorry? i dont understand how those are the two options
[03:00] tmpvar has joined the channel
[03:00] chjj: a socket is a socket, if youre talking to a mysql database, theres no way to get around using a socket
[03:02] ale: stagas: do you get noe what is my question?
[03:03] zilch has joined the channel
[03:04] stagas: ale: dunno you either run a proxy or listen on another port
[03:04] murugaratham has joined the channel
[03:05] ale: stagas: hmm what do you mean with listening on another port? Isn't that impossible without the need of writing it on the url?
[03:05] stagas: ale: yup
[03:05] chjj: ale: thats the point of a reverse proxy, you have the proxy listen on port 80, and it passes connections to something
[03:06] tristanseifert has joined the channel
[03:06] ale: chjj: So where should I make express to listen?

[03:17] adrianmg: any project on github using node.js to follow? recommendations? :)
[03:18] Sembiance: well, after lots of research (reading) I thought that 'dust.js' and 'handlebars' would be my most liked templating engines for node.js. However after USING them, I've found that I prefer the crazy simplicity of mustache :)

[03:59] jetienne: dabomb665m: i dunno the issue. but gut feeling, you sure the socket is pure tcp ? it seems like a rtmp connection to me. 182 would be the header
[04:00] dabomb665m: hrmm... we're using the flash socket class... it doesn't say it's an rtmp connection

[06:52] zilch: I have a question using cluster.js. Cluster.js provide a telnet based REPL plugin ... which can be used to control various aspects of your cluster configuration ... however it also notes that listen on any port using telnet leads to security holes
[06:54] zilch: If I am running my cluster.js/express.js based servers on ec2 and block the port which I listen to for telnet'ing , is it still a possible security risk ?
[06:54] zilch has joined the channel
[06:55] zilch: my idea is to only open the port when I want to telnet and then close it after I am done with my telnet session ... is it safe practice ?
[06:55] vid__: i think potentially yes since within your datacenter there might be others who can get to it
[06:57] zilch: vid__, so not to open the port is only safe option ?
[06:57] vid__: you can open it and iptable it to locally
[06:57] vid__: that means you would need to ssh to it and then connect
[06:57] zilch: and isn't ec2 ( as datacenter ) secure ?
[06:58] vid__: i actually use linode
[06:58] chjj: zilch: the docs recommend using a unix socket
[06:58] zilch: vid__, so leaving port 22 open is safe ?
[06:58] chjj: i think it might be wise to abide by that
[06:58] vid__: unix socket definitely more secure
[06:58] zilch: chjj, but then I have to ssh , right ?
[06:58] vid__: right
[06:58] chjj: why would that be a problem though? thats how you administer your server normally anyway
[06:59] zilch has joined the channel
[06:59] zilch: I mean I did go through the docs ..
[06:59] zilch: chjj,  vid__, so leaving port 22 open is safe ? 
[06:59] vid__: you can also tunnel through vpn
[06:59] damiano has joined the channel
[06:59] vid__: sshe is safe
[06:59] damiano: hello black & white

[07:00] vid__: o
[07:00] vid__: heh
[07:00] zilch: chjj, 22 is for ssh ...yup
[07:00] chjj: right i know that, im saying, yeah its safe
[07:01] chjj: unless you enable password login for root or something equally weird
[07:01] zilch: k ... so basically telnet is not safe as ssh ... can I conclude that ?
[07:01] vid__: yes
[07:01] zilch: ah ..
[07:01] zilch: one more security question ... since you have told that datacenters are not safe ...
[07:02] vid__: within your subnet
[07:02] vid__: there are other servers
[07:02] zilch: I am having reversproxy which listen's to HTTPS request on port 433 ... and the ssl termination is done at/on reverseproxy ...
[07:03] zilch: vid__, I understood that data centers ( including EC2 ) are not always safe ..
[07:03] chjj: you mean 443?
[07:03] vid__: ssl is safe
[07:03] zilch: chjj, sorry it is 443 ... typo 
[07:03] vid__: i thought we were talking about the telnet within the datacenter
[07:04] zilch: vid__, oh , I have digested the fact that telnet are not safe within the data center ...!!!
[07:04] vid__: ok

[07:04] zeade has joined the channel
[07:05] zilch: I am having reversproxy which listen's to HTTPS request on port 433 ... and the ssl termination is done at/on reverseproxy .... reverseproxy reads the request and based on the path forwards it to any of the actual services ... running on port 40111 and 40222 ...
[07:05] vid__: ok
[07:06] zilch: my question is ... is it ok to leave the communication between the reverse proxy and the actual services as HTTP or should I have it HTTPS ?
[07:06] zilch: I am having it using HTTPS ...
[07:07] csanz has joined the channel
[07:07] vid__: if you are serving static files http is fine
[07:07] vid__: but if its credit cards moving around i'd use ssl
[07:07] zilch has joined the channel
[07:07] zilch: so there is termination of ssl happening at the reverse proxy level when the requests arrive from clients ...

[07:09] vid__: yes ssl is slow
[07:09] damiano: can i create a pair as key in redis? like:     id : ip-address => value
[07:09] damiano: ?
[07:09] zilch: essenially  one more ssl encoding and one more termination ..
[07:10] zilch: vid__, what are acceptable trade offs ... I am not passing creditcard data ..
[07:10] vid__: a key can be anything in redis: i use uri format
[07:10] zilch: but I would still want to make reasonably secure !!

[07:11] damiano: is it possible?
[07:11] vid__: you can use iptable
[07:11] vid__: to restrict access
[07:11] zilch: talking about the communication between the reverse proxy and actual services instances
[07:11] zilch: vid__, static ips and iptable ... were answer to me I suppose ..

[07:15] damiano: vid__, i tried.... all sleeping :)
[07:15] digitalsabre: Someone give me a good reason why one would want to use event emitters.
[07:16] digitalsabre: I'm having trouble grasping them.
[07:16] SubStack: streams
[07:16] SubStack: they can emit different sorts of events
[07:17] SubStack: end, data, drain, error
[07:17] vid__: just create 2 keys for your value 
[07:17] SubStack: EventEmitters let you catch those events
[07:17] vid__: good answer
[07:17] zilch has joined the channel
[07:17] SubStack: catch and emit I should say
[07:18] damiano: redis.set([one, two], value ) <----- ?
[07:18] vid__: on and emit
[07:18] SubStack: the way the browser does it by default meanwhile is pretty shit
[07:18] SubStack: window.onload = function () {}
[07:18] SubStack: because you can only do assignment once
[07:18] digitalsabre: Sure, but… what sort of events can I catch using emitters, SubStack?
[07:18] SubStack: very tricky to set up multiple callbacks to fire in different parts of the codebase
[07:18] vid__: redis.set([one], value ) redis.set([two], value )
[07:19] zilch: digitalsabre, the events you deem fit for your design
[07:19] vid__: with a multi
[07:19] SubStack: digitalsabre: there is no distiction between sorts of events
[07:19] SubStack: events have a string for a name and may have data or not
[07:19] digitalsabre: zilch: What, precisely, is an event, then?  How do I know what is an event and what is not?
[07:19] damiano: vid__, are separated
[07:20] SubStack: one side does obj.emit('foo', 3, 4, [ 5, 6 ])
[07:20] zilch: digitalsabre, say for a pet you can have event wokeup, wentforsleep, poo, hungry
[07:20] SubStack: the other does obj.on('foo', function (x, y, z) {})
[07:20] SubStack: digitalsabre: events are not things
[07:20] mscdex: don't wanna forget to listen for the 'poo' event
[07:20] vid__: damiano: you can do what i do sometime
[07:20] vid__: create a global key
[07:20] vid__: or set
[07:20] digitalsabre: they're code structures?
[07:21] vid__: and add the key to that
[07:21] vid__: and then another one with value of it
[07:21] zilch: mscdex, poo jar ...lols ... nasty ugly me !!!
[07:21] vid__: key://keys1 [key1,key2]
[07:21] damiano: vid__, can i add key to another keys ?
[07:21] digitalsabre: So… every object can have only one event? :/
[07:22] vid__: key://keys1/value => value
[07:22] zilch: digitalsabre, your question are much to do with oops ( well mostly !!) and how events inter play among them ... If I am correct ...
[07:22] damiano: if i do: redis.set("key")
[07:22] vid__: you can create keys from another set
[07:22] vid__: using the name
[07:22] SubStack: digitalsabre: you have a very mistaken idea of how EventEmitters work, I recommend reading the documentation
[07:22] zilch: digitalsabre, object can have multiple events
[07:22] damiano: how can i do it with redis module ?
[07:22] digitalsabre: I'm trying to understand them from tjholoway's book...
[07:22] SubStack: digitalsabre: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.9/api/all.html#events
[07:23] digitalsabre: But it's not very clear.
[07:23] SubStack: tj wrote a book?
[07:23] zilch: SubStack, I am waiting from you ... :P with all that svgs ...

[07:27] SubStack: digitalsabre: methods have nothing to do with it
[07:27] digitalsabre: Then I'm not understanding the usefulness of emitters.
[07:27] damiano: vid__, LPUSH
[07:27] damiano: ok 
[07:27] vid__: yeah for the keys
[07:27] SubStack: digitalsabre: look at the examples here http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.9/api/all.html#events

[07:32] damiano: with the same user-password
[07:34] zilch has joined the channel
[07:34] digitalsabre: Okay… now… maybe this isn't the deepest grasp of the things, but… An event causes a listener to fire (when you call it by emitting the event).  If there are multiple listeners for that event, they all fire in order according to their sequence on a stack.
[07:35] a2800276 has joined the channel
[07:35] digitalsabre: In other words, after a fashion, it is a way one can sortof stack functions?
[07:36] vid__: you mean attach multiple listeners which are functions waiting for an event
[07:36] damiano: vid__, can i search in redis ...looking for "key://ip" text when the entire key is "key://ip:port"

[07:37] digitalsabre: vid__: That's what I mean, really.  Is there a difference between what I said and what you said?
[07:38] vid__: its cleaner than holding an array of functions and calling it all the time
[07:38] damiano: ok
[07:38] vid__: might be doing the same thing though
[07:39] digitalsabre: It's not much different, the way I see it.
[07:39] vid__: its cleaner
[07:39] vid__: i do it in query and in node.js
[07:39] digitalsabre: It looks like foreach(listener in eventListeners) { listener(arg1, arg2, arg3 … ); }
[07:40] digitalsabre: Oh, forgat an if.
[07:40] vid__: well i rather write less code
[07:40] digitalsabre: I'm not knocking it.  I'm trying to understand it.
[07:41] digitalsabre: Before I came in here, I didn't understand how it worked at all.
[07:41] vid__: and its object oriented
[07:41] vid__: the end result is the same thing
[07:42] digitalsabre: I have this feeling people think I'm attacking it and I'm not.  I didn't understand how it worked.  I'm not saying I don't understand why someone should use it.
[07:42] vid__: i think its the wording of the question that caused that
[07:43] digitalsabre: I was just pointing out that it looks like a foreach, which is useful in helping me understand it.
[07:43] vid__: seems like a lot of node.js modules in npm have memory leaks
[07:44] vid__: btw for arguments
[07:44] SubStack: then fix them
[07:44] digitalsabre: ?
[07:44] mscdex: digitalsabre: EventEmitters store listeners in an array already
[07:44] digitalsabre: Um… I got that, mscdex.
[07:45] mscdex: ok...? :S
[07:45] mscdex: then what is the issue?
[07:45] zidadi has joined the channel
[07:45] vid__: he's just trying to understand it i think
[07:45] digitalsabre: The issue was that I didn't understand what EventEmitters did before I came in here.  Now I have some handle on how they work and a good idea what they'd be used for.
[07:46] mscdex: alright
[07:46] digitalsabre: tj's book didn't really explain.
[07:46] mscdex: they're pretty simple really
[07:46] zidadi has left the channel
[07:47] mscdex: but incredibly useful
[07:47] digitalsabre: So I can create a stack so that when something happens, thirty-five different things happen.
[07:48] digitalsabre: And I can even have one listener conditionally add other listeners for the next trigger...
[07:48] mscdex: digitalsabre: you could
[07:49] digitalsabre: That's going to take a while for me to understand the complete implications of.
[07:49] mscdex: but i'd say most people don't do that usuall
[07:49] mscdex: usually
[07:50] mscdex: generally you have very few listeners for a single event

[08:47] SubStack: that should be enough
[08:47] chilts: :)
[08:47] SubStack: and it's easy to write libraries so lots of people do
[08:47] DrDetroit: queing system for ? 
[08:48] chilts: my application
[08:48] chilts: also, just so I could learn more
[08:48] DrDetroit: just seeking a balance between under rating and over rating.
[08:49] brokenjames: the c guys agreed an a language
[08:49] brokenjames: for the not c newbs
[08:49] DrDetroit: if the aliens landed- and said- what can you offer us ? 
[08:49] DrDetroit: ok ok - that is a STRANGE optic to shape a question.
[08:49] brokenjames: I would give them all the things I wanted to get rid of
[08:49] DrDetroit: well- good the chan is still here
[08:50] brokenjames: : / A little brevity never hurt any one.
[08:50] DrDetroit: I'm 43 - and programming since age 8 - and am reaching a point where I question intellectualizing for the sake of intellectualizing.
[08:50] DrDetroit: my problem need not be yours
[08:51] dexter_e has joined the channel
[08:51] DrDetroit: I DO know there is a 'fuss' about node.js - and an excitement
[08:51] DrDetroit: which is why I was ever brought here.
[08:51] DrDetroit: that 'excitement'
[08:51] brokenjames: We are not exactly interrupting any one and substack I am sure is busy making things for the Internet to borrow
[08:51] DrDetroit: alas I am interested in anything 'new' - 
[08:52] DrDetroit: however - I'm not so sure 'new' is always better.
[08:52] brokenjames: I would say that it alows the average basment hacker to utilize enterprise level networking tools for the first time
[08:52] DrDetroit: the anti-thesis to node would be ? 
[08:52] Croms has joined the channel
[08:52] brokenjames: It also brings an elastic ad hoc phone network a step closer because it is so bloody small
[08:52] brokenjames: I would say....
[08:53] zilch has joined the channel
[08:53] DrDetroit: if someone put forth the antithesis to node ? 
[08:53] DrDetroit: what would that look like ? 
[08:53] DrDetroit: locking ? 
[08:53] brokenjames: when you sit down to do something with it it is a drastic departure from conventional internets making
[08:53] DrDetroit: serious locking on every socket transaction ? 
[08:53] SubStack: DrDetroit: that is a very strange way to think about environments
[08:53] DrDetroit: SubStack- I agree- it just came to me 
[08:53] DrDetroit: to explore the 'antithesis' - agreed
[08:54] SubStack: DrDetroit: node is just some wrappers on top of v8 to do file and network i/o
[08:54] SubStack: that's all
[08:54] DrDetroit: helped me derive some 'way' to understand node or async better
[08:54] DrDetroit: Sub - about where I left off on it
[08:54] DrDetroit: ok

[08:57] DrDetroit: year 2000 - 2001,  stackvm would PROBABLY be a 100+ million venture
[08:58] DrDetroit: 'visionaries'
[08:58] DrDetroit: that's all I seek
[08:58] DrDetroit: +
[08:58] DrDetroit: Ryan here seems to be a visionary
[08:58] DrDetroit: you too Substack
[08:59] DrDetroit: I have no access to venture capital- can't help there. I'm strictly on the outside looking in.
[08:59] DrDetroit: you'll see- hit age 43- it's not easy to digest and adopt new technologies- BUT - you do see many 40,000 foot views- you see same thing over and over again.
[08:59] DrDetroit: not that aggregate count of revolutions around the sun add up to anything.
[09:00] DrDetroit: in any base.
[09:00] DrDetroit: so, to me - I approach node.js and ask myself- what's it all about Charlie Brown.
[09:00] DrDetroit: and I think you put it well - an async wrapper
[09:00] DrDetroit: now... WHY that is valuable - is of interest to me.
[09:02] DrDetroit: BOTTOM line though
[09:02] DrDetroit: I AM interested in what it ALL amounts to
[09:02] Croms has joined the channel
[09:02] DrDetroit: if node.js will enhance processing - 
[09:02] robotmay has joined the channel
[09:03] DrDetroit: BUT -  IS it ? nothing MORE than  ? an actuality - a functional wrapper 
[09:03] mraleph has joined the channel
[09:03] DrDetroit: yet- AN offering  - that simply WORKS
[09:03] DrDetroit: then I can settle on that understanding
[09:03] DrDetroit: and respect that
[09:03] DrDetroit: to be CAREFUL not to make anything more of it though.
[09:04] einaros: you're putting a little too much thought into this
[09:05] DrDetroit: :00)
[09:05] einaros: javascript is an ok language and eventing is a more comprehensible approach to dealing with many tasks more or less simulataneously, than say -- syncing threads yourself
[09:05] einaros: for me there's little more to it than that
[09:05] DrDetroit: indeed the event loop offers this
[09:06] DrDetroit: I used to dream about 'interrupt oriented' programming as a youth
[09:06] DrDetroit: event loop seems close to that
[09:06] DrDetroit: my interrupt was driven by vertical blank

[09:13] variablenode: why event based method better than thread based method
[09:13] variablenode: ??
[09:13] dt665m: sure... we're trying to link up a custom tcp protocol to communicate between our node server and a flash client
[09:13] dt665m: except i have no experience in dealing with tcp streams and what the 'proper' way to handle them are
[09:15] dt665m: basically, it would be helpful if someone could just list out the nuances and behaviors of tcp streams so I can code proper handling on the node end 
[09:16] einaros: variablenode: 'better' in terms of what?
[09:16] zilch has joined the channel
[09:17] DrDetroit: neat stuff to watch here
[09:17] DrDetroit: this is why I came
[09:17] DrDetroit: here- to see how people are using node.js
[09:18] variablenode: well there are two bench marks, memory and time
[09:18] variablenode: as well as multi programming
[09:18] variablenode: etc
[09:19] zilch has joined the channel
[09:22] temp01 has joined the channel
[09:23] variablenode:  where and why node.js should be preferred
[09:23] variablenode:  ??
[09:23] einaros: variablenode: most programmers I know, skilled and unskilled alike, have a poor understanding of the implications of concurrent processing, let alone synchronization of such
[09:24] einaros: thus, horrible bugs are born
[09:24] einaros: and for what purpose? for the most you don't actually need the 'speed' of rolling your own thread soup
[09:24] dt665m: yeah, einaros is right about threads and programmers in general
[09:25] dt665m: threads are just difficult to get right, from my experience
[09:25] ttpva has joined the channel
[09:25] zilch has joined the channel
[09:27] einaros: dt665m: regarding your custom protocol, the first thing you should consider is what kind of data you need to transfer. will there be need for binary?
[09:28] einaros: if binary isn't a requirement, I'd just consider sending CFLF separated JSON blocks, with a property indicating the command/event/message + whatever props you need for payload
[09:29] einaros: if there will be a lot of data, and frequently at that, other encoding options could be considered
[09:29] zilch has joined the channel
[09:31] dt665m: yeah... we're considering a messaged based encoding protocol.  In the strictest sense, we don't necessariy need binary... but our data will be really small and sent often... so binary seems like a good fit just for efficiency
[09:31] arpunk has joined the channel
[09:32] nodokodo has joined the channel
[09:33] dt665m: I guess from my quick research, handling tcp is really just figuring out (through protocol or otherwise) where the stream is supposed to start/end... and just handle the buffer's properly in node
[09:33] einaros: don't optimize unless you have to
[09:34] zilch has joined the channel
[09:34] einaros: and really, changing the encoder/decoder isn't much of a problem, if the rest of your architecture is sound
[09:34] dt665m: thats very true.  Any idea how all this stuff plays out, performance wise, with node?
[09:35] einaros: regarding the stream - either have a fixed message size (ugh), or have a separator (depends on the data and encoding. could be crlf, could be a more elaborate sequence, such as for chunked http transfers)
[09:36] smtlaissezfaire has joined the channel
[09:36] einaros: the perf depends on your data and architecture. start by writing a set of tests and benchmarks, and (loosely) aim to have an interchangable decoder / encoder
[09:36] EvRide has joined the channel
[09:36] einaros: sounds like a good path to follow
[09:37] zilch has joined the channel
[09:37] dt665m: yeah, i'll be looking into that.  Thanks for the input.
[09:37] SubStack: is there a way to query whether process.stdin has been paused?
[09:38] SubStack: fs's ReadableStream sets this.pause but even though process.stdin is supposed to be a readable stream .paused doesn't seem to ever get set
[09:39] SubStack: even if I call .pause()!

[17:28] mscdex: demod: an easy way would be to create ~/bin and add a symlink to python26 in ~/bin called 'python', and add ~/bin to your $PATH before anything else
[17:29] tuhoojabotti: TheJH: http://not.vlambeer.com/luftrauser/
[17:29] TheJH: tuhoojabotti, eww, flash
[17:29] AvianFlu: mscdex: I think that console.dir() only calls util.inspect with default args, whereas you can have it do funky stuff directly

[17:37] Malvolio has joined the channel
[17:38] Malvolio: Hey, does anybody know how to tell the configure script to call python "python2.6" -- on CentOS, "python" necessarily refers to Python2.4, which won't build Node.
[17:38] mscdex: Malvolio: an easy way would be to create ~/bin and add a symlink to python26 in ~/bin called 'python', and add ~/bin to your $PATH before anything else
[17:39] mscdex: :-)
[17:39] Malvolio: That makes sense.  I tried aliasing -- that didn't work at all.

[17:40] Malvolio: Actually, it would be good practice even without Node.  I hate accidentally starting up 2.4.
[17:40] AvianFlu: I hate that python has done so much breaking shit between minor versions
[17:41] AvianFlu: it's just such a common concern
[17:41] eldar has joined the channel
[17:41] mscdex: i don't know if that's really the issue, it's probably that something specific to newer versions of python is being used now for building
[17:41] mscdex: because until recently 2.4.x could be used
[17:41] demod: mscdex: it works! now is building :D
[17:41] mscdex: demod: cool
[17:42] Malvolio: The particular problem is that waf uses x =  a if c else b
[17:42] Malvolio: which is a 2.6 construct
[17:43] Malvolio: (Yeah, what kind of loon injects a huge language feature like comprehensions in a .x release?)
[17:43] avalanche123 has joined the channel
[17:43] mscdex: well, python problems should be going away with the use of gyp in 0.5/0.6
[17:43] Malvolio: gyp?

[17:44] mscdex: it's what the chrome/chromium team uses to build their browser for each platform

[17:47] mscdex: i'm not sure what version of python gyp requires though

[17:47] pquerna: though hopefully this is the last build system rewrite for node
[17:47] mscdex: pquerna: but maybe gyp is compatible with 2.4 at least
[17:47] pquerna: yes, it should be
[17:48] mscdex: which eases the pain some ;-)
[17:48] AvianFlu: it's still loony how much code I've seen break over needing 2.4 or >2.4
[17:48] pquerna: poor souls sitll running RHEL
[17:48] mscdex: heh
[17:48] AvianFlu: almost as funny as the fact that there's a python 3 that nobody uses
[17:48] mscdex: i use centos for some machines, but not rhel
[17:49] Malvolio: I just want to make the obvious point that you could use Node/V8/Javascript instead of Python for all this.
[17:50] demod: @pquerna: poor souls are use specialized program on centos (like Asterisk)
[17:50] pquerna: 2.4 was released in 2004
[17:50] Malvolio: Except for a Nodejs installer of course.
[17:50] pquerna: demod: poor souls using asterisk :(
[17:50] pquerna: rewriting asterisk in node.js -> hot
[17:50] mscdex: heh
[17:50] pquerna: well, a SIP implemenation would be a good start
[17:50] mscdex: that would be a huge undertaking

[17:51] pquerna: mscdex: http://journal.paul.querna.org/articles/2006/03/27/why-sip-sucks/
[17:51] Malvolio: Actually is there a Node.js implementation of XMPP?
[17:51] pquerna: i used to work on sip stuff. sigh.
[17:51] Malvolio: Uh, I suppose I could google for that...

[18:07] dob_: hello guys, i am new to node.js and want to build a application which can output data as html (with express) and output it as webservice for a native iphone application. Will i have to create a separate server for that or can i just do something like change the view?
[18:07] dob_: just asking cause i have no idea what's the best practice for something like that
[18:09] pifantastic: Anyone have a module recommendation (aside from jsdom) for parsing and traversing HTML?
[18:09] guybrush: dob_: you will need a computer + connection
[18:09] pifantastic: jsdom's memory woes are causing my problems
[18:09] pifantastic: me*
[18:09] Malvolio: @mscdex -- thanks, re-installed Node, NPM, and gitteh (apparently) successfully.
[18:10] demod: mscdex: sorry, i start to building 4.10
[18:10] dob_: guybrush: Alright, then i have anything i need.
[18:10] dob_: and then back to my question ;-)
[18:10] guybrush: dob_: ah lol i think i got your question now :D you mean routing?
[18:11] mscdex: dob_: you can do both in the same node instance
[18:11] guybrush: you dont have to run multiple server for separate routes if thats is what you want?
[18:12] dob_: Also if i use express? Thought with the express server i could only output normal html stuff.... I thought for rest services i should use the webservices module which creates also a new server. Isn't that correct?
[18:13] mscdex: dob_: you should be able to output whatever you want with express, not just html

[18:13] guybrush: you can do REST pretty good with express

[18:14] eliziario has joined the channel
[18:14] AvianFlu: xastey: put util.debug() statements all over the place and watch the output! XD

[18:16] teknopaul: dob_:  isntall eclipse https://github.com/teknopaul/node-launcher/wiki/Features
[18:16] AvianFlu: xastey: it depends on what kind of debugging you're trying to do
[18:17] teknopaul: eclispe has a fully fledged node debugger
[18:17] xastey: normal debuging, vars, step-in etc
[18:17] AvianFlu: there's a node debugger, and there's an app called node-inspector on npm that can help you
[18:17] AvianFlu: the idea with node-inspector is that you'd start your script in debug mode, like node --debug myscript.js
[18:17] avalanche123 has joined the channel
[18:17] AvianFlu: and then you run node-inspector, and you tell it to connect to the debug port, and it gives you webkit-esque debugging console in browser
[18:18] AvianFlu: for a node app
[18:18] xastey: i'll check that out
[18:18] AvianFlu: node-inspector would be running on port X, and you'd give it the debug port for your node app in the query string
[18:18] AvianFlu: there are decent docs for it somewhere but it's escaping me atm
[18:18] dob_: teknopaul: thanks for that tip. Looks great!
[18:19] teknopaul: you need to install  eclipseJS
[18:19] mscdex: ew java!

[18:20] teknopaul: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/using-eclipse-as-node-applications-debugger
[18:20] teknopaul: is a good guide to the v8 debugging bit

[18:21] tomshaw has joined the channel
[18:22] clifton has joined the channel

[18:26] mendel_: how do you guys convert lat/long to an actual address?
[18:26] AvianFlu: i.e. nothing prevents the app from functioning as it would
[18:26] mendel_: can use the google maps api but there's a limit + must be use the to show it on a gmap
[18:26] AvianFlu: mendel_ I think you'd need a big DB of locations, your own map, or somebody else's api

[18:44] kaarlo: heh, source looks now like: "var x = [object Object],[object Object].."
[18:44] TheJH: kaarlo, use JSON.stringify() on the server to convert the objects to strings
[18:46] a2800276 has joined the channel
[18:48] AvianFlu: desaiu: advice: JSON.parse() is a synchronous operation that can 'throw', and it's a very strict JSON parser, so putting it in a try/catch is a good idea
[18:49] kaarlo: TheJH: thank you alot :)
[18:49] AvianFlu: in actual scripts I mean, in the REPL it doesn't make much of a difference
[18:49] TheJH: desaiu, also, don't use readFileSync in actual scripts
[18:50] desaiu: What should I use then?
[18:50] TheJH: desaiu, fs.readFile
[18:50] AvianFlu: it takes a callback function as its last argument, and it calls the callback function when the file read is completed
[18:51] AvianFlu: in the sync version, your whole process waits until the read is completed - the async version, you get to run other code while you wait for the OS
[18:51] AvianFlu: i.e. other people's HTTP requests

[20:11] metaverse: TheJH: What about a generic setsockopt function which would allow you to tweak any TCP parameters?
[20:11] BrianTheCoder has joined the channel
[20:11] TheJH: metaverse, would probably be a good idea
[20:11] chjj: augustl, if they were created using object literal syntax, and you dont care if the properties are own properties or now
[20:11] chjj: you can to obj.__proto__ = obj;
[20:11] chjj: or
[20:11] chjj: obj1.__proto__ = obj2;
[20:12] augustl: I see, tnx
[20:12] metaverse: TheJH: Maybe I should ask ryah?
[20:12] chjj: but only use that if you dont care about the prototype of obj1
[20:12] ryah: ?
[20:12] TheJH: metaverse, or suggest it in a github "issue"
[20:14] metaverse: ryah: Hey! I want to set some TCP parameters through the "setsockopt" function available in both windows and unix. Is this possible in node? If not, could I make a pull request for it?
[20:14] ryah: metaverse: hey. we don't currently have a good interface for that - but you're welcome to add it to libuv
[20:15] ryah: metaverse: i would just ask that you include a new test which exercises them
[20:15] metaverse: ryah: Specifically I want to set "SO_RCVBUF" to 65,535
[20:15] ryah: metaverse: that should be doable windows has OS_RCVBUF and setsockopt
[20:16] metaverse: ryah: Yeah I just need a way to do it in node :P I'll give it a try through a pull request :P Thanks.
[20:17] ryah: metaverse: int uv_setsockopt(uv_stream_t*, int level, int optname, const char *optval, int optlen)
[20:17] ryah: metaverse: and define UV_SOL_SOCKET, UV_SO_RCVBUF

[20:54] kilian_: ok ok !
[20:55] kenperkins has joined the channel
[20:56] kilian_: i'm developing a tcp server, basically a client connects and sends messages to server and to other clients (a chat), and clients can sends raw data to other clients
[20:56] kilian_: i'm searching a pattern for parallelize the upload download between clients
[20:57] TheJH: kilian_, you mean, you want to mix the client-data-stream with other data?
[20:57] kilian_: the first thought was: i need to split data in packets
[20:59] kilian_: TheJH i mean something like skype, (i'am not writing skype but it's a good example), messages + file transfer
[20:59] kilian_: i should parallelize uploads
[20:59] Destos has joined the channel
[20:59] TheJH: kilian_, either use multiple connections or send length- and meaning-prefixed buffers or so
[20:59] augustl: so you're wondering how to write a protocol that supports both chat messages and raw data transfer?
[20:59] kilian_: so i written a explode + queue stream
[21:01] kilian_: augustl i know how to do that, i don't know what is the best for me, multiple connections or mono connection
[21:01] kilian_: TheJH yes you centered the problem
[21:01] augustl: I guess the answer is simple if you want to support chatting at the same time as file transfering
[21:01] augustl: I'm no pro, but connection multitasking sounds strange
[21:02] TheJH: augustl, I think it's called multiplexing and for short, high-speed transfers, it's a very good idea
[21:02] augustl: I see
[21:03] kilian_: in my mind the first sketch was: Message + attachment => packeting system => packet queue
[21:03] TheJH: augustl, e.g. http suffers from many connections that need to "heat up"
[21:04] TheJH: kilian_, I'd do packets with a structure like length+streamid+data
[21:04] kilian_: why streamid?
[21:04] tylergillies_ has joined the channel
[21:04] kilian_: do you mean message-id ?
[21:04] tylergillies_: anyone know a database like sqlite but stores the data in JSON?

[21:05] xerox: mongodb
[21:05] xerox: doesn't actually, but it's very similar to json :)
[21:06] tbranyen: like sqlite but stores data in JSON ,wat
[21:06] tbranyen: they aren't comparable
[21:06] tbranyen: heh
[21:06] TheJH: kilian_, well, if you have packets vor various streams, you have to be able which stream a message belongs to, no?
[21:06] tylergillies_: by "like sqlite" i meana file based database
[21:06] augustl: tylergillies_: so not a SQL db that persists with JSON?
[21:06] TheJH: tylergillies, couch? one file per database, I think
[21:07] tylergillies_: i was thinking couch, but thats a little heavy for that i want
[21:07] tylergillies_: im looking at jasondb website haven't looked into much though
[21:07] tylergillies_: s/that i want/what i want/

[21:27] mendel_: guys how would you do this: I have different folders, in each folder there is a static html file, each folder must have a seperate subdomain
[21:27] mendel_: I should use something like node-static or node-paperboy
[21:27] Country has joined the channel
[21:28] TheJH: mendel_, do you also have dynamic stuff?
[21:28] mendel_: it's all dynamic 
[21:28] TheJH: mendel_, static html files aren't dynamic, I think :D
[21:29] mendel_: sorry, the folders are dynamic (so I don't know which subdomains/folders)
[21:29] mendel_: the files itself are static yeah
[21:29] augustl: mendel_: it's quite simple to read the Host header and query the file system
[21:30] TheJH: mendel_, if you only have static stuff, node probably isn't the best solution
[21:30] augustl: TheJH: why is that?
[21:30] galaxywatcher has joined the channel
[21:31] TheJH: augustl, because node isn't as fast as other stuff for serving files or so
[21:31] mendel_: proxy node-http-proxy with a wildcard on a subdomain to a nodes instance, there check the host header and serve it with node-static
[21:31] mendel_: thnx
[21:31] TheJH: mendel_, that sounds just wrong

[21:36] xerox: or the equivalent of export on windows/cygwin

[21:36] |Freeman|: xerox: what does export do?

[21:38] TheJH: |Freeman|, the easiest way would probably be to use it in a linux vm
[21:39] metaverse: TheJH: I'm trying to test if my modifications works but "make test" after my additions. Could you help me parse this error message? https://gist.github.com/1144272
[21:39] japj: |Freeman|: you can try using https://github.com/japj/ryppi to install node modules on windows (it is a python script, so you will need to install that)
[21:40] metaverse: TheJH: make test fails*
[21:40] japj: |Freeman|: it could also be that you need to upgrade to a newer npm version
[21:40] |Freeman|: japj: thanks i'll take a look
[21:40] japj: |Freeman|:  npm is at 1.0.24 atm
[21:40] gkmngrgn has joined the channel
[21:41] japj: |Freeman|:  you have 1.0.6 installed, so that is "ancient" :)
[21:41] |Freeman|: japj: i understand but, it is hard to get precompiled packages including node and npm and also being recent :)
[21:41] tylergillies_: anyone know if you can do pouchdb to pouchdb replication? or do you need a couch in there?
[21:41] TheJH: metaverse, your knowledge of C seems to be better than mine :D
[21:41] japj: |Freeman|:  is that a cygwin based build of node you are using?

[21:42] japj: |Freeman|:  node for windows is currently reworked heavily in the 0.5.x series, but it is a 'unstable'/development version atm
[21:43] |Freeman|: japj: btw, how does np work... does it get the module from internet or do i need to place the module somewhere before running the cmd?

[21:43] metaverse: TheJH: haha, I haven't done any C in 3 years. I got exactly the same error when trying to compile node 0.5 on my mbp earlier today, it's not very descriptive :P
[21:43] japj: |Freeman|:  npm fetches modules from the npm registry, it also determines any version/submodule dependencies and resolves that (and fetches dependencies recursively)
[21:44] normelton: i'm subscribing to a redis event feed using the node_redis module. when an error occurs, my error handler is getting fired, but subsequent events are not being received?
[21:44] normelton: is it possible to resume parsing redis events after an error occurs?
[21:44] |Freeman|: japj: is that registry online?
[21:44] TheJH: metaverse, in my whole life, I've never written more than 100 lines of C, I think
[21:44] TheJH: s/never/not/
[21:44] TheJH: |Freeman|, yes
[21:45] TheJH: |Freeman|, http://search.npmjs.org/
[21:45] metaverse: TheJH: I just use high level languages. After doing 30 lines of c now, it's not that bad as one might think :P
[21:46] |Freeman|: TheJH: so typing npm install socket.io should install socket.io module and all modules it depend on from the internet... ?

[21:54] TheJH: |Freeman|, yes. e.g. for socket.io, go to http://search.npmjs.org/#/socket.io . click on latest. unzip the resulting file in a node_modules folder in your project. rename "package" (extracted folder) to socket.io. but that's not enough, you still need the dependencies, so:
[21:55] TheJH: |Freeman|, now, inside the socket.io folder, create a new node_modules folder. for each dependency listed on http://search.npmjs.org/#/socket.io (3), do the same, but put it in socket.ios dependencies
[21:56] japj: |Freeman|: https://github.com/japj/ryppi os basically a 'tiny npm' in python that does not have all the features npm has, but it can install packages including dependencies
[21:56] TheJH: we need a webservice that can bundle packages (include deps) for windows guys :/

[22:38] TheJH: |Freeman|, it should work

[22:50] davidwalsh has joined the channel
[22:50] tbranyen: TheJH: i think a few exist
[22:50] tbranyen: didn't substack just release one?
[22:50] tilgovi: tylergillies_: awesome
[22:51] TheJH: I want the one that extends the string prototype with various color getters
[22:51] eee_c has joined the channel
[22:51] mikeal: i think it's just called colors
[22:51] mikeal: i think marak wrote it
[22:51] TheJH: substacks is more for drawing stuff on the terminal, I just want colors
[22:52] TheJH: mikeal, ah, thanks!
[22:56] papandreou: mikeal: Hey, about https://github.com/mikeal/request/pull/50 ... It won't apply cleanly after you did all those stylistic changes, but it still includes some nice simplifications and 2-3 bug fixes. Have you taken a look at it?
[22:57] chjj: anyone want to test my frontend app framework for me? i wrote it specifically for amazing people who like node
[22:57] chjj: https://github.com/chjj/rondo
[22:57] mikeal: what were the bug fixes?
[22:57] zilch has joined the channel
[22:57] tylergillies_: mikeal <- https://gist.github.com/1144343
[22:58] tbranyen: chjj: i've been using backbone lately, but sure i'll give it a try
[22:58] papandreou: mikeal: request.defaults(...)(url) doesn't work (only accepts an object)
[22:58] mikeal: tylergillies: no idea
[22:58] tylergillies_: dang
[22:58] mikeal: papandreou: i fixed that today actually :)
[22:58] papandreou: mikeal: request.pipe(stream, {end: false}) doesn't work (2nd arg not passed)
[22:59] mikeal: i happened to step on it myself
[22:59] jarek has left the channel
[22:59] papandreou: mikeal: And this one: https://github.com/papandreou/request/commit/c10443c3ca0f4d3793a8e4703e8ce9a8586af8d5
[22:59] mikeal: that's intentional
[22:59] mikeal: i can't support it
[22:59] mikeal: well, maybe i can now
[22:59] papandreou: mikeal: the {end: false} thing, why not?
[22:59] mikeal: when i first added the pipe support it wasn't possible
[22:59] chjj: chjj: ah, well its a dom library and app framework, i wouldnt call it similar to backbone, its more express-like
[23:00] Sorella has joined the channel
[23:00] chjj: but thanks for giving it a try if you do
[23:00] papandreou: mikeal: Why wouldn't it be enough to pass it to Stream.prototype.pipe?
[23:00] TruPpp has joined the channel
[23:01] mikeal: the way i used to do it was to pipe directly from the source to the dest and then sit on the end event myself in order to finish
[23:01] mikeal: that is no longer the case
[23:01] mikeal: the Request object itself is piped out
[23:01] mikeal: so now it could probably work
[23:01] papandreou: mikeal: Ah, ok

[23:08] R4md4c has joined the channel
[23:08] papandreou: mikeal: I know, but it's allowed with dot notation. Express also supports both app.del(...) and app.delete(...)
[23:08] EvRide1 has joined the channel
[23:09] mikeal: i know, but it's bad practice 
[23:09] dgathright has joined the channel
[23:09] papandreou: mikeal: I disagree
[23:09] jesusabdullah: Why is it bad practice?
[23:09] mikeal: to use reserved words?
[23:10] R4md4c: Error: Error closing database { stack: [Getter/Setter], arguments: undefined, type: undefined, message: 'out of memory' }. Please I am desperate to know what causes that error in sqlite-node. It is occurring randomly 
[23:10] papandreou: mikeal: It's one of the original design errors of JavaScript that reserved words weren't allowed with dot notation.
[23:10] jesusabdullah: Yeah, why is that bad if it works and isn't confusing?
[23:10] mikeal: it is confusing, first off
[23:10] jesusabdullah: I've never been confused by it
[23:10] jesusabdullah: :/
[23:10] mikeal: and it's not guaranteed to always work
[23:11] mikeal: lots of stuff like this broke when they did strict mode
[23:11] jesusabdullah: I still kinda feel like it's only bad form because people *say* it is
[23:11] mikeal: and it is confusing, because the delete statement actually removes an object 
[23:11] mikeal: so you would expect it to remove the object, not make an HTTP request
[23:12] papandreou: mikeal: ES5 explicitly relaxed the reserved word after dot thing.
[23:12] jesusabdullah: but obj.delete and delete obj aren't the same
[23:12] mikeal: they aren't, but they are close :)
[23:12] jesusabdullah: idk maybe it's just me
[23:12] papandreou: mikeal: And request isn't exactly a browser library, so it's guaranteed to always work.
[23:12] mikeal: you know how the language works
[23:12] jesusabdullah: but I don't think I'd misinterpret that one
[23:12] mikeal: you're experienced, you wouldn't mess this up
[23:12] jesusabdullah: I suppose so
[23:12] mikeal: you aren't everyone :)
[23:13] jesusabdullah: I *should* be
[23:13] jesusabdullah: lol :D
[23:13] papandreou: mikeal: I think it's a bigger source of wtfs that request.delete() doesn't exist.
[23:13] papandreou: mikeal: I'm just recommending that you allow both, not that you remove request.del
[23:14] mikeal: most people don't even know there is an HTTP delete method, i doubt they'll go calling it randomly :)
[23:14] mikeal: here, i'll take this
[23:14] mikeal: you want to alias delete() to del(), or the other way around, fine
[23:14] mikeal: but i won't document it as .delete(), it'll be documented as .del()
[23:15] |Freeman|: what does this button do? *presses HTTP delete method" ^^ sorry i am bored or something :p
[23:15] papandreou: mikeal: Hehe, ok. Nice easter egg :)
[23:15] mikeal: if someone calls it without reading the docs it'll work as expected

[23:18] hellp has joined the channel
[23:18] skampler: http.delete('/object')
[23:18] papandreou: mikeal: To get rid of the duplication you also need to move the check for whether a HEAD request includes a body into the Request constructor (which makes sense anyway): https://github.com/papandreou/request/commit/da9a3cbdb01b4cb061357bbaed6ada9f7c056eb0
[23:18] skampler: looks fun
[23:20] mikeal: actually, we can get rid of that
[23:20] mikeal: there is a check in core now
[23:20] papandreou: Ah, even neater :)
[23:22] TheJH: what are you talking about? a db?
[23:24] TheJH: mikeal, pouchdb probably doesn't use the same storage format as couchdb, right?
[23:24] mikeal: format?
[23:24] papandreou: mikeal: I think those were the important ones, the rest is pedantic stuff like not using "i" as a variable name for non-integers.
[23:24] TheJH: mikeal, the on-disk stuff, with serialized erlang data and stuff
[23:24] mikeal: it stores things in a compatible way, but in order to work in the browser it uses IndexedDatabase as the underlying storage mechanism
[23:24] visnup has joined the channel
[23:25] TheJH: ah, ok :(
[23:25] mikeal: but replication doesn't care about the storage mechanism
[23:25] mikeal: so they'll be able to replicate with each other
[23:25] TheJH: mikeal, just asking because I want to understand the storage format
[23:25] TheJH: (of couchdb)
[23:25] mikeal: of couch?
[23:25] mikeal: it's an append-only btree
[23:25] mikeal: totally custom
[23:26] mikeal: it's very specific to the couchdb erlang implementation 
[23:26] TheJH: mikeal, I already know some stuff about it, but not enough to access it from JS
[23:27] hij1nx has joined the channel
[23:27] TheJH: mikeal, but I can already copy documents from a hex editor into my javascript and let it convert them to JSON :)
[23:27] zilch has joined the channel
[23:27] metaverse: TheJH: FYI, ry helped me fix my compile issues with "make clean all". Also, I have a pull request for my SO_RCVBUF open: https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/1525
[23:27] mikeal: it would be a bad idea to try and duplicate that in a javascript couchdb
[23:28] TheJH: mikeal, probably true
[23:28] mikeal: replication between erlang couches doesn't even do that
[23:28] TheJH: mikeal, I don't want it for replication :)
[23:28] mikeal: they just talk JSON between them
[23:28] papandreou: mikeal: Ah, you can even get jslint to "tolerate" dot notation + reserved word: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/jslint_com/message/1260
[23:28] mikeal: i enjoy watching jslint cry
[23:29] systemfault: I hate lints, they're too opnionated to my taste.
[23:29] systemfault: *opinionated even
[23:29] mikeal: jshint is nice
[23:29] TheJH: mikeal, I want to see how fast a good JS implementation would be compared to the erlang code for serving attachments or so
[23:29] mikeal: you can make it tune to your own style
[23:30] systemfault: mikeal: Might be worth checking then :)
[23:30] mikeal: serving attachments out of the file format requires understanding the whole format :)

[23:30] mikeal: because attachment chunks are written to disc in between pages and then the doc meta is written when it's done to reference the chunks
