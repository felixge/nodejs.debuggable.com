[00:01] marcello3d: play framework does the reverse routing thing
[00:01] marcello3d: and it's pretty badass
[00:01] marcello3d: because it's typesafe and compiled
[00:01] marcello3d: but it also does this neat thing with get/post/url parameters
[00:02] ckknight: what's that?
[00:02] tjholowaychuk: IMO the url helper thing only really makes sense for resources
[00:02] marcello3d: where basically your HTTP handler looks like: public void routeName(String someParam, String someOtherParam, int blahblah) ...
[00:02] ckknight: ah, yeah
[00:03] marcello3d: and you define a route like: GET /blah/:someParam    ClassName.routeName
[00:03] marcello3d: then it just figures it out
[00:03] tjholowaychuk: what is weird about that?
[00:03] marcello3d: and puts those values of those types int he parameters
[00:03] ckknight: that's pretty typical
[00:03] tjholowaychuk: almost every framework does that
[00:03] eguest309: cant seem to create connections when using node.js with some code  written in it for teh server.all is get is  socket.io ready - accepting connections .but after that nothing happens.even when i connect although there is space for connections
[00:03] MatthewS: this is probably my own issue but, are there any known fd leaks/issues with udp dgram stuff in node?
[00:03] marcello3d: tjholowaychuk: the function definition defines the parameters
[00:03] marcello3d: and then if I want the url
[00:03] marcello3d: I just do url = ClassName.routeName("some","prefilled values", 45)
[00:03] tjholowaychuk: marcello3d: ohhh i thought you were just mapping it
[00:04] ckknight: marcello3d: yes, that is very typical, especially for statically-typed languages which have an MVC routing pattern.
[00:04] Aria: ACTION finally unsubscribes from the Ruby mailing list. node has my sole willingness to answer noob questions now.
[00:04] ckknight: marcello3d: you can actually do that with my escort lib
[00:04] marcello3d: and it generates "/blah/some?someOtherParam=prefilled+values&blahblah=45"
[00:04] marcello3d: ckknight: but they don't have the reverse routing part, that's the magic part
[00:05] evilhackerdude: btw, is the new node_libraries folder in project roots supposed to be checked into git repos?
[00:05] marcello3d: also, for an http redirect
[00:05] marcello3d: you just call the route
[00:05] marcello3d: and it handles it as a redirect
[00:05] Aria: evilhackerdude: git submodule, perhaps -- depends on what your development and distribution looks like
[00:05] evilhackerdude: for npm 1.0, i mean
[00:05] omni5cience has joined the channel
[00:05] marcello3d: it does a lot of bytecode manipulation for all of that to work
[00:05] marcello3d: but has the nice side effect of being typesafe in IDE
[00:06] marcello3d: evilhackerdude: I would say no
[00:06] Aikar: evilhackerdude: for a stable project id def recommend checking it into your VCS
[00:06] isaacs: evilhackerdude: depends
[00:06] quackquack has joined the channel
[00:06] eguest309: any help
[00:06] isaacs: evilhackerdude: i don't check it in.

[00:06] quackquack: How can i set up my Node.js server to require HTTP Basic Authentication (I am using Express)
[00:06] c4milo1 has joined the channel
[00:07] Aikar: either install to that folder with npm then add it, or set it as a git submodule
[00:07] isaacs: Aikar: or just add it to .gitignore
[00:07] tjholowaychuk: quackquack: app.use(connect.basicAuth(user, pass)), app.use(connect.basicAuth(callback)) etc
[00:07] ckknight: marcello3d: yeah, that's one thing that you can't do in javascript, but I pre-compute as much as possible upfront in my lib so that things are as fast as possible, the URL generation ends up being just a simple string concat.
[00:07] Aikar: isaacs: id rather have it checked in :P i dont like the idea of npm install being part of a deploy process
[00:07] isaacs: i mean, srsly, if you're just using the basic published API of a relatively stable module, then you really dont' need to check a whole other project into git
[00:07] evilhackerdude: isaacs: submodule or dependency in package.json?
[00:07] marcello3d: isaacs: but what if npm disappears!
[00:07] isaacs: evilhackerdude: both :)
[00:07] marcello3d: or the guy unpublishes his project!
[00:07] marcello3d: (or her)
[00:08] max_dev has joined the channel
[00:08] quackquack: tjholowaychuk: thank you! So i should run `npm install connect`, right?
[00:08] isaacs: evilhackerdude: definitely list it as a dependency
[00:08] some1else has joined the channel
[00:08] johans_: Stylus - does not like child selector inside a media query - throws unexpected indent error
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: johans_: hmm, open an issue, I will get it fixed
[00:08] johans_: will do - thanks
[00:08] marcello3d: does express still export all the connect handlers?
[00:09] tjholowaychuk: marcello3d: yup
[00:09] Aikar: isaacs: diff between OSS modules and actual "applications", for apps i tend to think if my code relies on it, i want it to be part of the "package" to deploy :P
[00:09] marcello3d: quackquack: then use express.basicAuth
[00:09] tjholowaychuk: connect.basicAuth / express.basicAuth etc are the same
[00:09] quackquack: Ah, thank you!
[00:09] Aikar: and make sure the version doesnt update accidently and break
[00:09] marcello3d: Aikar: any tutorials on how to do the submodule thing?
[00:10] isaacs: Aikar: "bundledDependencies" : [ "everything", "you", "want", "bundled" ]
[00:10] isaacs: Aikar: then npm install all those things, and your package will contain them
[00:10] marcello3d: isaacs: but the you don't get the source history
[00:11] evilhackerdude: isaacs: if my package.json was created by 1.0, are the <1.0 people able to install it just fine?
[00:11] Aikar: isaacs: eh i dont really intend to deploy an app with npm :P
[00:11] isaacs: marcello3d: you don't get the source history if you just npm install them, eithe
[00:11] evilhackerdude: i don't think anything changed, but not sure.
[00:11] Aria: I want development kept separate from the things I depend on; deployment, however, I want a bundle (or a reliable repo of deps)
[00:11] isaacs: evilhackerdude: depends.
[00:11] marcello3d: isaacs: right, that's why he's arguing for submodule
[00:11] isaacs: if you want submodules, use submodules.
[00:11] isaacs: if you want npm dependencies, use npm dependencies.
[00:11] isaacs: if you want to check them into git, do that.
[00:11] Aikar: marcello3d: git submodule add repourl node_modules/blah
[00:11] isaacs: there's not really a "best practice" here.  even the tradeoffs are all fairly minor.
[00:12] Aikar: ie git submodule add git://github.com/a/b node_modules/b
[00:12] dgathright has joined the channel
[00:12] Aikar: then git submodule update --init --recursive after you clone a repo that uses submodules
[00:13] Aria: I really wish that last bit was automatic. 
[00:13] Aikar: yeah me too
[00:13] tjholowaychuk: recursive can be baddddd
[00:13] tjholowaychuk: takes forever
[00:13] Aikar: tjholowaychuk: well if your checking out a clone for first time, if your submodule has a dep, you kinda need it :P
[00:13] dgathright has joined the channel
[00:13] evilhackerdude: as a seasoned hater of git submodules i went for a package.json
[00:14] tjholowaychuk: Aikar: yeah you do, but sucks you have to pull in all of that repo's development deps too
[00:14] evilhackerdude: https://github.com/evilhackerdude/multi-repl <- yay
[00:14] Aikar: Aria: having to deal with like  15 svn externals every time i do an update at work, yeah i can see why git made it seperate
[00:17] Aikar: well more so would like to exclude certain ones from update, as systems team does occasionally update the internal environment tools, but stuff like phpunit etc that never updates def doesnt need daily checking :(

[00:24] wilmoore has joined the channel
[00:25] Aikar: make a new class that extends event emitter, then overwrite the write method to simply do this.emit('data', instead?
[00:25] tlrobinson: Aikar: that's what i started doing but realized there may be something built in, no?
[00:26] TooTallNate: tlrobinson: Try my "FakeDuplexStream": https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-stream-stack/blob/master/util.js
[00:26] Aikar: there is a pipe feature but its really based on i/o

[00:50] tbranyen: monokrome: those work most def
[00:50] monokrome: Hmm... Yeah, they are.
[00:50] tbranyen: a shebang isn't a comment
[00:50] monokrome: I tested to see if # is a comment in the shell
[00:50] tbranyen: its a shebang
[00:50] yenz: lulz
[00:50] monokrome: but I guess there's some sort of exception for shebangs.
[00:50] mscdex: ACTION shakes a fist at Android's browser

[00:51] monokrome: but that still doesn't explain my issue :P
[00:51] tbranyen: we can do better than that
[00:51] andi5: monokrome: Then you need to use CoffeeScript
[00:51] monokrome: tbranyen: The shebang explains why the script works like: ./server.js
[00:51] monokrome: but not: node server.js
[00:51] monokrome: node must have a special exception for it.
[00:51] tbranyen: fantasia rules

[00:53] tbranyen: monokrome: same is true for any scripting language with a shebang?

[00:53] monokrome: Because that narrows it down quite a bit

[00:54] tbranyen: helll yea
[00:54] jesusabdullah: heh
[00:55] mjr__: pretending is fun
[00:55] jesusabdullah: Is lua worth learning?
[00:55] pquerna: au <3
[00:55] tbranyen: jesusabdullah: if you write decent JS and are familiar with pythonic/rubiac style languages
[00:55] jesusabdullah: Assume that I will never have any interest in writing WoW extensions.
[00:55] pquerna: lua <3
[00:55] tbranyen: its pretty natural to pick up
[00:55] jesusabdullah: I know both JS and python
[00:55] pquerna: tbranyen: don't even need llvm, luajit is so awesome
[00:55] tbranyen: jesusabdullah: well JS was worth picking up and you aren't make mouse trails
[00:55] monokrome: It's worth learning if you want to embed it or use something else that embeds it.
[00:55] jesusabdullah: I don't know if you could call me *good* at them---I'll let others decide that.
[00:55] jesusabdullah: tbranyen: True. XD
[00:56] jesusabdullah: Man I need to build those numerical libs for JS

[04:26] skiz: hey guys, I just switched from macports to brew a few days ago and I'm trying to get my node going again.  I did a brew install node, then an install of npm from master, and npm and node look fine.. however when I install jslint or jake, or anything with binaries, I cannot seem to find them, however I do find a few bins with jslint.js, etc but shouldn't there be a consolidated bin dir somewhere?
[04:26] pyrotechnick: wats the name of the event
[04:27] bingomanatee: IGN Entertainment INC
[04:27] pyrotechnick: its like a pitch?
[04:27] pyrotechnick: or its a meetup?
[04:27] pyrotechnick: kinda confused
[04:27] bingomanatee: 2nd street - out of curiosity - since you are remote, why does it matter to you?
[04:27] pyrotechnick: no im just wondering what kind of event it is
[04:27] pyrotechnick: its a meetup right
[04:28] bingomanatee: well what the people want to know is, what is the Node.js development experience, advantages, difficulties, tips and tricks, and how does it scale.
[04:28] skiz: anything can scale, you just need lots of duct tape :P
[04:28] indiefan2a: is it possible to bust require's cache for a file, or force it to reload a file?

[04:28] MikhX has joined the channel
[04:29] mscdex: robertkeizer: why are you using an array like an object?
[04:29] mscdex: robertkeizer: in recurseDirReturnArray
[04:29] bingomanatee: wow. Those are real words, skiz! very impressive. And they all were spelled correctly too. 
[04:29] bingomanatee: Please tell me that web development is not your day job. 
[04:29] robertkeizer: mscdex: I'm not, its all arrays in that function. Its just an indexed array.
[04:30] skiz: bingomanatee: of course it is, and no, I didn't say what kind of duct tape.
[04:30] mscdex: robertkeizer: directoryContents is an array of strings and you're doing: "returnArray[directoryContents[x]] = tmpFileContent" where returnArray is an Array
[04:30] bingomanatee: ACTION is not listening. I have given up on web development and I am now at a pigfarm. 
[04:31] ckknight_: bingomanatee: but is it web scale?
[04:31] mscdex: robertkeizer: that should be assigning string keys in the Array instead of numberic indexes
[04:31] mscdex: *numeric
[04:31] robertkeizer: mscdex: Yes, that is assigning string keys instead of numeric indexes..
[04:31] mscdex: robertkeizer: so why not use an Object?
[04:32] mscdex: robertkeizer: array functions won't work on something like that :S
[04:32] bingomanatee: ACTION is knee deep in pig shit. The smells make me want to pass out but it is still preferable to listening to people who read some pissant website and think they are engineers.

[04:33] robertkeizer: mscdex: I wanted to be able to do sysctl()["net"]["ipv4"]["conf"]["all"]["forwarding"] .. don't ask me why.. sounded like a good idea at the time, so I wrote a function to convert those kind of arrays into an object rather than rewrite the function that already worked.
[04:33] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[04:33] skiz: so no ideas on the brew/node/jslint/bin issues eh?
[04:33] robertkeizer: I'll have to go back and rewrite all of these functions, but I'm just playing right now..
[04:34] ckknight_: skiz: my guess is that it's merely a PATH issue
[04:35] skiz: ckknight_: thats what I thought too, but no consolidated bin paths anywhere
[04:35] ckknight_: I'm not sure where homebrew sticks its stuff
[04:35] robertkeizer: mscdex: And whats wrong with using indexed arrays as opposed to numeric ones? I find its easier when searching through multi dimensional arrays.. 
[04:36] __directory: do brew --config and poke around
[04:36] mscdex: robertkeizer: because they're not arrays anymore
[04:36] mscdex: robertkeizer: the only reason that works is because an array is an object
[04:36] __directory: brew puts stuff in in a police sub station or cellar
[04:37] mscdex: and objects allow string properties
[04:37] skiz: well yeah, I got node fine, npm is putting shit in strange places
[04:37] skiz: npm via master, guess I'll check out a tagged version, but wtf no bins
[04:38] robertkeizer: mscdex: Fair enoguh.
[04:38] ckknight_: hey, I have a folder in my node.js project that will have 1 or more .json files in it. What would be the best way to read in each file (not necessarily knowing their names ahead-of-time)?
[04:38] mscdex: robertkeizer: but anyway, what i'm saying is you can just change returnArray in recurseDirReturnArray to be an Object and then return the value of recurseDirReturnArray in exports.sysctl instead of calling that arraytoobj function on it
[04:38] mscdex: robertkeizer: so then you can do: exports.sysctl().sys.foo

[04:41] ryah_: skiz: which version of npm are you using?
[04:41] skiz: ryah_:  head
[04:42] mscdex: robertkeizer: you could make it even fancier (at the expense of some slight performance hit) by making exports.sysctl a getter instead of a function, then you can do without the ()
[04:42] ryah_: skiz: did you install the thing globally?
[04:42] skiz: ryah_:  yeah looks likt it

[05:13] indiefan2a: anyone know if it's possible to use require.cache to bust require's cache and hotload a file?
[05:13] isaacs: indiefan2a: yes.  but don't do that.
[05:13] isaacs: you don't need to do that
[05:14] indiefan2a: or else some other method that doesn't require a third party module or a fork?
[05:14] dandean: pyrotechnick: got it. So I could just create a bash script to run `cake` in the parent directory on postinstall.
[05:14] dandean: Should the module's package.json file be amended to include coffee-script as well?
[05:15] indiefan2a: isaacs, what would you suggest?
[05:15] isaacs: indiefan2a: why do you need to hot-reload a module?
[05:16] isaacs: skiz: still around?
[05:16] skiz: isaacs: indeed
[05:16] indiefan2a: writing an irc bot that i'd like to be smart enough to reload plugins without having to reboot. The scope is pretty manageable
[05:16] SubStack: process.exit()!
[05:16] SubStack: indiefan2a: you can use ipc for that
[05:16] SubStack: or rpc or whatevs

[05:19] guybrush: isaacs: hm, i cant install jsdom locally - global works just fine https://gist.github.com/907082
[05:19] skiz: isaacs:  not with 0.3.18 :)  basically I pulled master from github, git a (sudo? I forget) make install and npm worked fine, would install stuff, etc, but as soon as I tried to install something like jake or jslint, I couldnt find the bin dir, so after looking around for a while I found a ".bin" dir in /usr/local/node_modules but it was heartbreaking :(  given it's master, I forgive you, just wanted to give you a heads up and question/co
[05:19] skiz: the .bin dir
[05:19] inimino: SubStack ⋱ ah.
[05:20] isaacs: indiefan2a: the problem is if one of those things does a require() of something else, or sets up some cyclic links, it's easy to leak memory
[05:22] isaacs: skiz: works for me? https://gist.github.com/907083
[05:22] SubStack: indiefan2a: there is no file, you write plugins as independent processes that connect to the irc service
[05:23] SubStack: indiefan2a: check out the bin/say.js, which connects to the service and tells it to say something on a channel
[05:23] indiefan2a: so is require.cache the only way to break require's cache?
[05:23] skiz: isaacs: hrmm, not sure what was up, I wish I had my terminal scrollback :(  I'll drop you a line if I come across it again. 
[05:24] isaacs: skiz: kk.
[05:24] isaacs: skiz: it's better to get on 1.0, though
[05:24] isaacs: it's better
[05:25] indiefan2a: SubStack, does your bot have some sort of Observer syntax for plugins to capture messages and process?

[05:31] isaacs: guybrush: right, no symlinks suported in windows filesystems
[05:31] isaacs: indiefan2a: i mean, delete the key out of require.cache

[09:31] dekervit: Hi
[09:31] Tyrkul: hey
[09:32] Tug: Is someone using express-jsdom ? I'm not sure I understood 'aspects'
[09:33] Tug: ?
[09:36] Tug: I want to do long polling with js-dom and saw the relay aspect but I don't think I can really use it as my event is not triggered by a user
[09:36] Tug: so I tried to do my own : https://github.com/Tug/express-realtime
[09:36] Tug: but I don't know how to integrate it ^^
[09:36] JimBastard: boom: http://blog.nodejitsu.com/nodejs-training-sessions
[09:38] Tug: I'm following a bit node news
[09:38] Tug: not sure your website talks about jsdom
[09:41] JimBastard: sup?
[09:41] Tug: JimBastard > sorry I thought you were answering me :)
[09:41] JimBastard: no, just spamming. whats your question?
[09:41] JimBastard: what you trying to do?
[09:41] saikat has joined the channel
[09:41] Tug: mm I want to make a module for long polling
[09:42] Tug: I use express-jsdom

[09:52] Tug: hum nothing ?
[09:53] Tyrkul has left the channel
[09:54] Tug: express-jsdom allow server DOM right ? So one can make a module for long polling using jsdom lib
[09:54] Tug: not sure it's the right way
[09:55] JimBastard: not even close
[09:55] JimBastard: maybe we should back up a few steps
[09:55] Tug: did you see https://github.com/Tug/express-realtime ?
[09:55] JimBastard: what EXACTLY are you trying to build
[09:55] Tug: it's what 'm trying to do
[09:55] Tug: ok my app is an uploader
[09:56] JimBastard: i might be blind, but your approach looks completely fucked
[09:56] Tug: I want the server to send data to the client when an upload is finished
[09:56] JimBastard: have you looked at socket.io or dnode?
[09:56] Tug: sorry when it starts
[09:56] Tug: socket.io yes
[09:56] JimBastard: https://github.com/substack/dnode
[09:57] asabil has joined the channel
[09:57] Tug: mm it's websocket I think
[09:57] JimBastard: i dont see why jsdom is part of this problem at all
[09:57] JimBastard: it has fallback
[09:57] Tyrkul has joined the channel
[09:57] JimBastard: for all transports
[09:57] V1: I don't see why you would want to do longpolling at all
[09:57] JimBastard: it will revert to XHR if websocket or flash is not availble
[09:57] JimBastard: V1: there are cases where its better solution
[09:57] d0k has joined the channel
[09:57] JimBastard: V1: less cases everyday i think
[09:58] Tug: V1: I have to give a link to the client when the upload starts
[09:58] Tug: this link will depend on the file
[09:58] V1: JimBastard: Yeh I'm trying to think of one.. But I can't come up with a valid case of choosing polling over sockets
[09:58] JimBastard: Tug: just setup dnode methods, and call them from node....this will fire them on the client
[09:59] JimBastard: V1: when you might only send an update once or twice a minute?
[09:59] JimBastard: i dunno
[09:59] Tug: JimBastard: ok I'm gonna look
[09:59] V1: I know that http://flish.net/ is build ontop of Socket.IO
[09:59] V1: which.. is also a upload site that shows progress :)
[09:59] eventi has joined the channel
[09:59] JimBastard: Tug: JSDOM is for a virtual dom...you shouldnt use it for doing things node does natively
[09:59] JimBastard: if you want a "long-poll" in node, just dont res.end()
[09:59] JimBastard: it will stay open forever
[10:00] deedubs has joined the channel
[10:00] JimBastard: im going to go out on a limb and say you want to use dnode for your problem, ill put 5 bucks down on jsdom being wrong
[10:00] JimBastard: good luck
[10:00] Tug: ok, the problem I had with jsdom is that I had to remove all my js in my html and wrap them into aspects
[10:00] Tug: so I thought I'll continue that way

[10:07] pietern: 64 bit int
[10:07] pietern: and things need to be fast
[10:07] JimBastard: a bit above my paygrade, maybe post to the mailing list...
[10:07] pietern: so I could call JS from there when it exceeds the representable threshold
[10:07] pietern: but it kind of sucks v8 doesn't do 64 bit ints... 
[10:08] JimBastard: i dont think you are the first person to bump into that issue

[10:08] xla has joined the channel
[10:09] pietern: JimBastard: think so too, but given that v8 still doesn't do a 64-bit, I don't think there's a native solution

[10:10] SubStack: as many bits as you please

[10:11] V1: but that's not a C extension it's just rip out of the google closure library

[10:16] abracsi: hi guys, i have only ever written javascript for browers, however if you're using it for a personal project, you might like to do things that interact with files on your hard drive, or read/write to the copy paste buffer.. so is there something like a browser i can download that will run javascript but with 'extra powers' that you probably wouldn't want to use to view pages on the web because it might be unsafe?
[10:17] JimBastard: aslakhellesoy:  search: '?first=It\'s%20broken&second=gone',
[10:17] JimBastard: aslakhellesoy: node -v v0.5.0-pre 
[10:17] JimBastard: what version you on?
[10:18] abracsi: i thought you guys would be well down the path of 'running javascript on a machine' rather than just for webpages
[10:18] aslakhellesoy: JimBastard: 0.4.5
[10:18] aslakhellesoy: It works correctly in 0.4.1, but is broken in 0.4.2-0.4.5
[10:18] JimBastard: its working here, im not sure
[10:18] aslakhellesoy: JimBastard: works ok in 0.5.0-pre?
[10:19] JimBastard: its working on my machine which runs that, yes
[10:19] misterncw has joined the channel

[10:19] JimBastard: anytime my good man!
[10:20] pietern: V1: it's for the hiredis ext , so having an accurate int is a big deal, but I guess the pure javascript parser also has a problem here

[12:48] burny has joined the channel
[12:49] mikegerwitz: jscheel: Underscore would still have to loop behind the scenes, though :) Which would be slow
[12:49] [AD]Turbo: but using socket.io I can extract a client given its session id in a fast way: socketServer = io.listen(webServer); client = socketServer.clients[viewerDoc.sessionId];
[12:49] jscheel: mikegerwitz: yep, but _.pluck() and _.detect() are still great :)

[13:15] abracsi: baudehlo1, and so my thinking was.. make a program that i could highlight text, click a button, and it would prompt me for a proerty name.. then it would replace the text i'd highlighted with  some tag syntax and output a new proerty to an external file

[13:18] mikegerwitz: abracsi: If you can do it without a GUI, I'd just make a shell script, but you're on Windows..so it may complicate things. Perl's an excellent option too.
[13:18] baudehlo1: though none of those options helps you learn node.js :)
[13:19] abracsi: lol
[13:19] abracsi: no true
[13:19] abracsi: i just thought node.js is something i want to work towards
[13:19] baudehlo1: unless you spawn node from your text editor for the solution.
[13:19] abracsi: right..
[13:19] baudehlo1: but since node has no GUI libraries yet, that's gonna be tough.
[13:20] abracsi: ah
[13:20] abracsi: yeh i see a big part of it as the ability to quickly select the required text to convert
[13:20] seivan has joined the channel
[13:20] baudehlo1: it's possible you could just do it all in a browser.

[13:21] abracsi: i can do most of it in a browser..
[13:21] baudehlo1: if it were me I'd just use CamelBones.
[13:21] abracsi: but it's the old saving to text files
[13:23] abracsi: so.. writing a script for my IDE..
[13:23] ryah_: realgt: okay - if not then it should be soon

[13:25] sfoster: I was writing dreamweaver extensions over 10 years ago

[13:26] Aikar: https://github.com/aikar/wormhole/blob/master/src/wormhole.cc#L77   anyone know why this function might be segfaulting?
[13:26] abracsi: sfoster.. so i could. with javascript.. write some script that dreamweaver can somehow use to do the sort of thing i mentioned above?
[13:27] Aikar: it works 2 times successfully (well, 4, i call it to see if theres another after success which goes result > none > result > none > segfault

[13:37] Aikar: i did gdb node blah.js
[13:37] Aikar: typed run
[13:37] mraleph: better use debug version of node
[13:37] Aikar: then typed input into the script and when it segfaulted nothing useful
[13:37] Aikar: so gdb node --debug?
[13:37] mraleph: no node_g
[13:37] mikegerwitz: Aikar: type 'bt' after the segfault

[14:54] bingomanatee_: I've put a Wikia up at http://nodejs.wikia.com/wiki/Node.js_Wiki - while there is some overlap (grafting) of the official node docs and wiki, it is a good place to "Drop notes" and do Q and A on node - check it out!

[14:55] ryah_: bingomanatee_: we have a wiki already on github, btw

[16:46] gf3: tjholowaychuk: are you using Jerk or IRC-js?
[16:46] tjholowaychuk: gf3: irc-js i think
[16:47] tjholowaychuk: guillermo added it a long time ago
[16:47] iammerrick: would it be a combination of fs.watchFile() an fs.createReadStream
[16:47] tjholowaychuk: gf3: is jerk better?
[16:48] gf3: tjholowaychuk: in that case you'd have to listen for privmsg, and parse the `this.options.nick` out
[16:48] gf3: tjholowaychuk: Jerk is a bot DSL I made on top of IRC-js
[16:48] gf3: tjholowaychuk: https://github.com/gf3/Jerk
[16:48] tjholowaychuk: gf3: ah gotcha, looks a bit more like what I need, just basic stuff
[16:49] tjholowaychuk: irc-js tripped me up a few times since you dont use .on() like node does and have your own emitter-ish thing

[16:54] BHSPitMonkay: gf3: I figured out the formatting stuff, by the way, in case you think it'd be useful for the docs
[16:54] BHSPitMonkay: they're just ASCII characters that go in the message
[16:54] gf3: BHSPitMonkay: ahh, that's what I suspected
[16:55] gf3: BHSPitMonkay: I could add something like: IRC.colours = { ... }
[16:55] BHSPitMonkay: so, .say(String.fromCharCode(2) + "This phrase" + String.fromCharCode(2) + " is bold.")
[16:56] BHSPitMonkay: I just ended up making my own function that adds those to the beginning and end of a given string
[16:56] BHSPitMonkay: not sure how or if you would implement it in jerk itself
[16:58] bradleymeck: fadeddata seems the scripting module wasnt found during waf
[16:58] bradleymeck: thats python/waf domain idk 
[16:58] BHSPitMonkay: I'd like to opensource the jerk bot I made, but I'm not sure how to best generalize it
[16:59] BHSPitMonkay: perhaps I shouldn't worry about it
[16:59] fadeddata: bradleymeck: Yeah, I'm reading about that. I think my install is hosed but I have no idea where everything is littered so that I can just delete it all.

[17:21] tiemonster: lol. staying up isn't the problem. ;-)
[17:21] tiemonster: our team is made up of 6 college students, and me
[17:21] bingomanatee_: okay 
[17:21] tiemonster: one of the devs volunteered to present
[17:21] tiemonster: but he has limited knowledge of the big picture
[17:21] bingomanatee_: so pick your best man. 
[17:22] tiemonster: and probably wouldn't be much good for Q&A

[17:23] iammerrick: gf3: I am trying to get a jerk bot up and running and it seems to run fine and I get a response from freenode but I never see it in any of the channels I would expect?

[17:24] bingomanatee_: It worked out fine. They just charged us for a space. 
[17:24] iammerrick: gf3: Ok so just give it a while
[17:24] bingomanatee_: Its fairly common but you have to work the system before people will let you speak at their place for free.

[17:25] iammerrick: ahh ok
[17:25] bingomanatee_: I hope you don't seriously expect me to pay a speaking fee. We have had top notch speakers to date as volunteers - if I was going to start handing out speaking fees, I think that Mikael and SubStack would be first in line

[17:32] tiemonster: bingomanatee_: ok. it looks like I can get at least one to attend. how would that work? watch on justin.tv and skype in when it's our turn?
[17:32] bingomanatee_: Put your answer directly on the meetup message board so Dave K. is aware of it. That is the "Contract with Nodemerica."
[17:33] bingomanatee_: We will be distributing information to the confirmed speakers - there is an IGN system that might enable some casting. I'll have more details later.

[18:00] jbardin: is it possible to use nodejs as a library?
[18:00] tiemonster: bingomanatee_: yes
[18:00] tbranyen: jbardin: seem some talk of it
[18:00] tbranyen: never seen it embedded tho
[18:01] jbardin: that is, "embed" it into another application, so i can use its feature, but not have to have the entry point be /usr/bin/node ?
[18:01] tiemonster: jbardin: another C++ application?
[18:01] jbardin: i mean, in theory, i should be able to find the main source file for /usr/bin/node, and replicate that functionality in my application?
[18:01] jbardin: yes
[18:01] ph^ has joined the channel
[18:02] tiemonster: it's fairly modular. should be possible.
[18:02] tiemonster: what functionality are you specifically interested in?
[18:02] jbardin: i would imagine the main.cpp for node is nothing more than a bunch of CLI argument processing, and initilization
[18:02] jbardin: the two things that interest me are its networking, and the fact thats its also a JS intepreter
[18:02] tiemonster: src/node.cc has most of the meat
[18:02] jbardin: i want to try to use it from a client-side perspective
[18:02] liar has joined the channel
[18:03] tiemonster: V8 is very easy to embed, and doesn't require node at all
[18:03] jbardin: its entirely possible to make client connections with it correct?
[18:03] steph021 has joined the channel
[18:03] tiemonster: you mean use it as a client for another server-side program? yes
[18:03] jbardin: yes
[18:03] jbardin: excellent
[18:03] Tobsn: does anyone know how to push a cloned repo back to github in cloud9ide?
[18:04] jbardin: i mean, once the connection is made, the callbacks are sorta all the same
[18:04] jbardin: some data comes in, some data goes out
[18:04] tiemonster: it should theoretically be possible. not sure how difficult it would be.
[18:04] bingomanatee_: speedy thing goes in...

[18:25] bingomanatee_: In the sense of responding to events it depends on what is the specific task you want to do with your daemon.

[19:30] arpegius_ has joined the channel
[19:30] sechrist: creationix: Do you use npm with nvm? If so, how do you avoid the mess of version compatibility/metadata/etc
[19:30] tjholowaychuk: ilya: you can use connect.static even if you are not using connect
[19:30] tjholowaychuk: (or any of the middleware)
[19:31] sechrist: my only idea is to put npm inside of the nvm or something
[19:32] ilya: tjholowaychuk: I tried that, but I also need to sort of plug in my own middleware in the static file server. I need to perform some stuff between a request and response and I couldn't figure out how to do that with connect-static.
[19:32] pdelgallego_ has joined the channel
[19:32] tjholowaychuk: ilya: pretty easy really, it just has a callback like anything else in node
[19:32] tjholowaychuk: so its pretty flexible
[19:32] ckknight: ilya: you just stick your own middleware before the static middleware
[19:32] wereHamster: at which times is ryan around usually?
[19:32] tjholowaychuk: or wrap it in your own middleware
[19:33] ilya: maybe I should look at it again. But what I needed to do was easy with node-static, though.
[19:33] isaacs: sechrist: yes, install npm with the nvm-node
[19:33] isaacs: sechrist: i do this with nave all the time
[19:33] bradleymeck has joined the channel
[19:33] sechrist: What's nave?
[19:33] reid has joined the channel
[19:34] tjholowaychuk: ilya: connect's is more full-featured
[19:34] isaacs: sechrist: it's a bit like nvm.  except that i wrote it, so it smells like me, so i like it better.
[19:34] tjholowaychuk: ilya: should be just as easy to wrap it
[19:34] tjholowaychuk: ilya: in fact the signature is essentially the same
[19:34] isaacs: sechrist: http://github.com/isaacs/nave
[19:34] ilya: perhaps I can refactor my code later when I make things work as they are.
[19:34] ilya: tjholowaychuk: you wouldn't happen to know anything about couchdb, would you?
[19:34] sechrist: are you saying I should use nave or that I should install npm while inside of an nvm node?
[19:34] tjholowaychuk: ilya: nah i havent used it personally
[19:35] sechrist: ah ok if nave has npm awareness i'll use it
[19:35] isaacs: sechrist: nave and nvm are very similar.  but yes, you should install npm while inside of an nvm state
[19:35] ilya: tjholowaychuk: ah, too bad. I'm having issues getting image attachments from couchdb.
[19:35] sechrist: isaacs: are old versions of npm available?
[19:35] isaacs: sechrist: nave uses subshells, whereas nvm is a bash subroutine.  that's the only difference.
[19:35] sechrist: npm won't install for < 0.4 for me
[19:36] isaacs: sechrist: they're *all* tagged in the git repo, back to 0.0.1, but you can also set the "npm_install" environ when you run the install script to pick a different branch

[19:37] NuckingFuts has joined the channel
[19:37] ilya: AntelopeSalad: wow, awesome. Thanks! But I think my problem is node not handling the returned attachment properly.
[19:37] isaacs: sechrist: npm 0.3+ requires node 0.4+
[19:37] sechrist: ah gotcha
[19:37] isaacs: sechrist: follow up question: why are you using node 0.3.7?
[19:37] isaacs: that's insanity
[19:37] sechrist: I'm trying to run zombiejs
[19:37] sechrist: there's so many moving parts of it
[19:37] isaacs: sechrist: and zombie doesn't work on node 0.4?
[19:37] sechrist: that i'm in dependency hell
[19:38] AntelopeSalad: ilya: ah, np
[19:38] sechrist: I have no evidence that it does
[19:38] isaacs: sechrist: oh no, i'm so sorry to hear that.
[19:38] mjr__: isaacs: so I'm trying out the new npm, and I need/want global installs for my servers.  It seems that npm -g by default puts things in a place where node by default doesn't find them.
[19:38] ilya: AntelopeSalad: but, maybe you could take a look at my code?
[19:38] isaacs: mjr_: this is correct.
[19:38] sechrist: it's throwing a lot of errors that it didn't used to when I used it last
[19:38] sechrist: but that was a generation ago in node and zombie so I don't know
[19:38] rafacv has joined the channel

[19:39] ilya: AntelopeSalad: ah, lol, alright )
[19:39] mjr__: Yeah, I just haven't reworked everything to use local node_modules dirs yet.  
[19:39] mjr__: I was surprised that the defaults for those two things (node and npm) didn't overlap.
[19:40] saschagehlich has joined the channel
[19:40] sechrist: -sigh- this is why I can't use node at work
[19:40] sechrist: I point out a project and spend 3 hours trying to get it to work
[19:40] sechrist: when I got it to work at home on a weekend in like 20m
[19:41] mjr__: sechrist: in my experience, it's the same story outside of node land as well

[19:53] tiemonster: I just might root my Kindle 3 to try it
[19:53] halfhalo: but.... why... doesn't the kindle have like a 3mhz cpu?
[19:53] asdfsafdsa: is there a good positional command line options parser module?
[19:53] sechrist: Does the kindle 3 still have the USB network interface?

[19:54] BigWookie: hmm could be a cloue, the interface of maemo is made in python too
[19:55] sechrist: It's something to do with memory management. I don't remember exactly

[19:56] TooTallNate: https://gist.github.com/855607
[19:56] EyePulp: so if I have some long running code I want to be able to control from the command line, is there a simple listener I can be running or a module that wraps that up (like a live version of nopt)
[19:56] sechrist: OOH RIGHT
[19:56] ilya: TooTallNate: what about all the dependencies?
[19:56] sechrist: because of Nitro!
[19:56] ilya: already there?
[19:56] sechrist: Apple removed the restriction so they could introduce Nitro

[19:57] TooTallNate: But not everything is working properly, and I can't seem to get gdb working on my iphone

[20:20] ckknight: here's an open-ended question: for a web project (not necessarily node.js), how long does it take you guys between making a change to code and getting a response back from the service? (i.e. change code, your service restarts/updates, go to browser, refresh). In my current situation on an ASP.NET project, it's at least 2 minutes.
[20:20] peregrine81: tiemonster: i get the error " job not found"
[20:20] tiemonster: peregrine81: try running that line outside of upstart
[20:21] tiemonster: kkaefer: imports should be cached, and npm should overwrite (install once) each dep
[20:21] tiemonster: ckknight: instant
[20:21] ckknight: tiemonster: using node.js? Yeah, that's my experience as well.
[20:21] tiemonster: unless you're using a compiled language
[20:21] kkaefer: tiemonster: they aren't cached because they are physically separate files
[20:21] ckknight: I'm just frustrated. :P
[20:22] kkaefer: tiemonster: and node has logic that detects that and loads the module again
[20:22] tiemonster: ckknight: you're using ASP.NET. It's understandable.
[20:22] raidfive has joined the channel
[20:22] tiemonster: kkaefer: imports installed with npm should not be using filesystem paths. they should look like `var express = require('express');`
[20:23] kkaefer: tiemonster: that's not what I'm talking about
[20:23] kkaefer: do a npm install express
[20:23] kkaefer: node
[20:23] kkaefer: require('express')
[20:23] kkaefer: Object.keys(require.cache)
[20:23] kkaefer: you'll see that node loaded the mime and qs module twice
[20:23] kkaefer: because npm installed two physical copies
[20:24] jmhnilbog: actually, I only see one qa and one mime when I do that.

[20:55] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: it's on my todo list to split out the code into a pure-js glob function.
[20:55] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: cool that would be nice
[20:56] tjholowaychuk: might be cool to expose the c shell expansion stuff to js too

[20:56] tjholowaychuk: not sure how portable the c calls are though
[20:57] akashiraffee: WRT connect.static:  the first arg is a path relative to what?  The server root?
[20:58] ckknight: akashiraffee: I think you should give an absolute path
[20:58] tjholowaychuk: akashiraffee: you should __dirname + '/whatever'

[21:04] akashiraffee: I totally do not get the point of path.resolve.  __dirname+"/static" don't work.
[21:04] tjholowaychuk: akashiraffee: __dirname + '/static' GET /somefile.txt
[21:04] tjholowaychuk: etc
[21:05] tjholowaychuk: if you want '/static' as part of the pathname you need to do app.use('/static', samething)

[21:09] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: i yanked out the glob.c and glob.h from NetBSD, and then added a bunch of ifdefs to make them work on linux, mac, and solaris
[21:09] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: does it support everything? {,foo} etc?
[21:09] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: yeah
[21:09] tjholowaychuk: cool
[21:09] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: it's just a binding to the C glob api that netbsd has
[21:09] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: *but*, the odd thing there is that the fnmatch function it provides isn't compatible with the glob() function
[21:10] Gruni has joined the channel
[21:10] isaacs: so fnmatch("foo/**/bar", "foo/baz/a/b/c/bar") should return true, but even though glob() understands **, fnmatch doesn't
[21:11] isaacs: another option woudl be to make node-glob GPL, and bind to bash4's or linux's thing, but no thank you
[21:11] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: there is wordexp() as well, but i dont know if its gnu specific or what

I use autocomplete implementation of Ajax Powered AutoComplete for JQuery from this site http://www.ramirezcobos.com/, which is based on this previous implementation http://www.brandspankingnew.net/specials/ajax_autosuggest/ajax_autosuggest_autocomplete.html .. this Powered implementation use Ajax (for get dynamic data over HTTP request) and jQuery implementation for

[21:17] rburhum has joined the channel
[21:18] teemow has joined the channel
[21:18] EyePulp: DoNaLd`: so you use https, which is about as good as you'll get in this scenario.  At that point you just need something that answers xhr requests across an SSL connection.  pretty much any web server/platform is capable of this.
[21:18] EyePulp: s/xhr/https
[21:18] DoNaLd`: EyePulp: do you have some simple example ?
[21:19] EyePulp: DoNaLd`: nope.  from the sound of it I don't think you're too sure of what you're asking about.  I think you need to decide on your backend setup before worrying about the front-end adornments.

[21:27] akashiraffee: kkaefer: yes, typo was here, not in the original
[21:28] kkaefer: you're retyping your code into irc?
[21:28] akashiraffee: Some of it, sorry.
[21:28] kkaefer: akashiraffee: __dirname refers to the directory where the javascript file is located, not the current working directory
[21:28] EyePulp: DoNaLd`: you should learn how ajax or xhr works first.  Then you can make any server platform connect to jquery
[21:29] tjholowaychuk: akashiraffee: GET /something.txt would try ./static/something.txt
[21:29] kkaefer: so if your file is in /server/app.js, __dirname is '/server', not /
[21:29] akashiraffee: Okay, still, console.log(__dirname); reports the correct path (as in, it has a sub /static)
[21:29] akashiraffee:

[21:48] ckknight: beriberikix: correct, that's the easiest way, but not the best way. The best is to at least do it asynchronously

[21:49] tjholowaychuk: AFAIK its just the string expansion
[21:49] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: oh, no, actually, it's definitely the other way round
[21:50] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: (i've read the source of glob.c and glob.h)

[21:51] tjholowaychuk: weird, will have to read up more on those
[21:51] ckknight: incredi: out of my scope at this point. I generally think it'd be better to do your algorithm continuously as you recieve data and then call some callback when finally finished.

[23:16] beriberikix: tjholowaychuk: How do I add a favicon in Express?
[23:16] SubStack: beriberikix: app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/static'))
[23:16] vahe has joined the channel
[23:16] SubStack: then throw a favicon in static/
[23:17] beriberikix: SubStack: that's silly easy, thanks
[23:19] isaacs: SubStack: did you see?
[23:19] isaacs: SubStack: npm install tap
[23:19] SubStack: isaacs: yep!
[23:19] isaacs: SubStack: (don't worry, the next release of npm will not be so naive about deps)
[23:20] isaacs: SubStack: right now, it ends up installing *!17!* versions of some of the deps.
[23:20] isaacs: ¡aye!
[23:20] SubStack: haha
[23:20] isaacs: because i cut the tap suite up into such small reusable bits.
[23:20] SubStack: wow yeah, that `npmdep tree tap` output is impressive
[23:20] SubStack: 75 lines!
[23:21] SubStack: dnode is only 24!
[23:21] isaacs: SubStack: i know, and it's only 7 packages!
[23:21] SubStack: circular dependencies <3
[23:21] isaacs: yeah
[23:22] isaacs: also, most of the tap-* packages all depend on inherits and tap-assert, so that one gets into all of them
[23:22] bnoguchi: beriberikix: Connect (and thus express) comes with a favicon middleware - https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/master/lib/middleware/favicon.js
[23:23] SubStack: isaacs: also I'm checking out a place closer to downtown oakland tomorrow morning

[23:23] bnoguchi: beriberikix: connect.createServer(
[23:23] bnoguchi:   connect.favicon(__dirname + '/public/favicon.ico')
[23:23] bnoguchi: );
[23:23] SubStack: and another once jesusabdullah gets down here

[23:26] beriberikix: bnoguchi: so Express-speak: app.use(express.favicon(__dirname + '/public/favicon.ico')); ?
[23:26] bnoguchi: beriberikix: Yea
[23:26] isaacs: SubStack: nice, we should definitely do that
[23:26] bnoguchi: beriberikix: or just place it directly in express.createServer(...<here>...)
[23:26] beriberikix: sweet, thanks
[23:26] tjholowaychuk: beriberikix: favicon() will be faster, stores it in memory
[23:26] isaacs: SubStack: npmdep update is painful.
[23:27] SubStack: yeah :(
[23:27] SubStack: I've finally looked into how couch works so I can probably fix it now
[23:27] sstephenson: isaacs: is there a page i can link people to for instructions on installing the npm 1.0 rc?
[23:27] isaacs: SubStack: it'd be better to have it just use npm's registry.get(), since that uses the cahce anyhow
[23:27] SubStack: oh neat
[23:27] isaacs: sstephenson: http://github.com/isaacs/npm :)
[23:27] isaacs: sstephenson: it's on HEAD
[23:28] isaacs: SubStack: also, use 1.0 ;P
[23:28] sstephenson: oh, cool
[23:28] SubStack: ACTION npm update npm
[23:28] SubStack: npm info outdated Everything up-to-date.
[23:28] isaacs: SubStack: doesn't wokr
[23:28] SubStack: do I need to pull from git?
[23:28] isaacs: SubStack: npm 1.0 can only be installed wiht npm 1.0 or higher
[23:28] pquerna: hows the office hours?
[23:28] isaacs: SubStack: you can curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | npm_install=rc sh
[23:28] SubStack: to obtain npm v1.0 you must first obtain npm v1.0!
[23:28] isaacs: exactly!
[23:28] isaacs: (or curl)
[23:29] isaacs: or you can check out the code and do make install
[23:29] beriberikix: tjholowaychuk: if I just put favicon.ico in the public folder, it works. Which method is it using?
[23:29] SubStack: yeah just doing that

[23:29] tjholowaychuk: beriberikix: whichever is first, they will both work
[23:29] beriberikix: nice
[23:29] isaacs: SubStack: $ npmdep tree tap
[23:29] isaacs: No such package "tap"
[23:29] SubStack: isaacs: did you update?
[23:30] isaacs: yeah, i did `npmdep update` and then it went for a really long time
[23:30] SubStack: it builds a cache at __dirname + '/.cache' with all the dependency info
[23:30] SubStack: hmmm
[23:30] pquerna: busy today with ops myself.
[23:30] isaacs: i see
[23:31] beejeebus has joined the channel
[23:31] isaacs: SubStack: yeah, it's not in there.  `npm view tap` shows it, though
[23:31] SubStack: odd!
[23:33] nahshon: c4milo: Thak you very much NJS is installed on my pentium III
[23:34] isaacs: SubStack: so, i split up the functionality into all different sections, but i didn't split up the tests.  so, node-tap is the only one with tests, which is a bit odd, given the purpose of the project

[23:39] mjr__: cool
[23:39] isaacs: seems that's the latest on riak-js, too
[23:39] isaacs: so it should install properly
[23:40] isaacs: pillars of the node community must be on 1.0.  This is my quest.
[23:40] rchavik has joined the channel
[23:40] chapel: isaacs: any concise info on converting your package to 1.0?
[23:41] isaacs: chapel: well, i think the only gotcha is that .gitignore files will keep stuff from being included.
[23:41] chapel: is that it?
[23:41] isaacs: chapel: but most people sorta figured it worked that way anyway.
[23:41] isaacs: yeah, most of the package author gotchas were all in 0.3
[23:42] isaacs: i tried to make those changes first, so that 1.0 would be a bit easyer
[23:42] isaacs: chapel: the 1.0 snags are all on the users' end.  global/local stuff, etc.
[23:43] chapel: ah
[23:43] chapel: sounds good to me
