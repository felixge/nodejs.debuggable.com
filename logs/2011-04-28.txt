[00:00] brownies: ACTION might spend tonight learning node.js
[00:00] SubStack: good plan!
[00:00] mscdex: brownies: you know you want to :-D
[00:00] SubStack: I should work on my nodeconf slides
[00:00] brownies: soooo... what's the canonical node.js tutorial for web devs guys? i'm comptent... i write a lot of python and obj C daily. i just thought i could get away with contracting this one out.

[00:01] SubStack: brownies: I think it helps more if you have something you want to build in mind first
[00:02] brownies: SubStack: i have a live node.js app that i need to debug.
[00:02] SubStack: also http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.6/api/all.html
[00:02] brownies: very much appreciate the links. thanks.
[00:02] mscdex: s/v0.4.6/v0.4.7/
[00:02] mscdex: :P
[00:02] stagas: s/v0.4.7/latest/
[00:02] mscdex: is latest still updated?
[00:03] devdazed has joined the channel
[00:03] stagas: I think so
[00:03] mscdex: looks like it
[00:04] mscdex: i just know that node-latest.tar.gz was pretty stale not that long ago
[00:04] mscdex: but that's updated too it seems
[00:04] brownies: one quick question. when you write a "proper" node.js app... is the entire thing supposed to be in one file?
[00:05] mscdex: it doesn't have to be
[00:06] ardcore has joined the channel
[00:06] mscdex: you can separate out your app into logical partitions as modules

[00:32] moshe: coleb suggested to set up node.js to serve my client file from the server as a static file and said it will be easier to get done with express but I haven't figured out how and if it's really necessary 
[00:32] jesusabdullah: Here, hold on, it's a one-liner basically
[00:32] jesusabdullah: for serving static files with express or connect
[00:32] konobi: middleware
[00:32] jesusabdullah: connect.createServer(connect.staticProvider('/home/josh/www/')).listen(8080)

[00:40] brownies: ok let's back up...
[00:40] brownies: what're some good links to learn *javascript*?
[00:42] c4milo1 has joined the channel
[00:42] mikegerwitz: brownies: I recommend Javascript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford. Not a link, but does an excellent job of covering the language. (Just ignore his opinions if you wish)
[00:42] mscdex: brownies: maybe this would help: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide
[00:42] brownies: mikegerwitz: is it short/readable? i know plenty of other languages so i just need to get up and running fast
[00:43] moshe: wait, question... in the index.html file got this line => var client = new Faye.Client('http://localhost:8000/faye', {
[00:43] brownies: mscdex: hm, nice, i can probably read all this. thanks.
[00:43] moshe: oh wait
[00:43] mikegerwitz: brownies: It's less than 200 pages and you can use it as a reference manual if you wish, rather than reading chapter by chapter
[00:43] moshe: think i know whats wrong
[00:44] moshe: client can't go do http://localhost:8000/faye since there is no such place 
[00:44] moshe: or well, isn't localhost = the folder of server.js ?
[00:45] mikegerwitz: brownies: It goes into great detaila bout grammar, language oddities/gotchas, etc.
[00:46] mscdex: moshe: no, the faye server should handle that request, since it matches your "mount point"
[00:47] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[00:47] mscdex: moshe: but i don't think the faye server dishes up your html or the faye.js file, so that's why you have to serve that yourself
[00:47] moshe: but it's going to the wrong location, no?
[00:47] mscdex: what is?
[00:48] moshe: oh
[00:48] Corren has joined the channel
[00:48] moshe: hmm well
[00:49] moshe: if mount is /faye , shouldn't my client.html file be at /faye/client.html?
[00:50] moshe: or it doesn't matter
[00:50] moshe: ?
[00:50] mscdex: no
[00:50] moshe: ok
[00:50] mscdex: from what i gather the "mount point" is the url the browser client uses to do the actual communication with the faye server
[00:50] mscdex: s/url/path/
[00:51] moshe: the actual path of the files doesn't matter then
[00:51] moshe: alright
[00:51] moshe: well, server won't load up now
[00:51] Bwen has joined the channel
[00:52] moshe: no sorry it does my bad, same message
[00:52] mscdex: moshe: so navigating to http://localhost:8000/client.html does not get you the client page?

[00:57] moshe: so do we have a connection now ?

[01:13] moshe: well localhost:8000/ gives Helloo, non-Bayeux request but localhost:8000/client.html = blank page
[01:13] moshe: so I'm not completely sure what it's doing or serving... 
[01:13] mscdex: right, it will be blank, because there is nothing on client.html, just some javascript
[01:14] moshe: so it doesn't serve the js ?
[01:15] moshe: okay, checked, it does serve the html
[01:15] mscdex: moshe: check to see what it's loading... use firebug if you're in firefox or the developer tools in chrome

[01:50] SubStack: I need to clean up that dnode example chat
[01:50] moshe: how come?
[01:50] mscdex: SubStack is your go-to guy for dnode ;-)
[01:50] moshe: Hi substack ;-)
[01:50] moshe: yeah I know
[01:50] SubStack: well transports doesn't even work anymore
[01:50] SubStack: it's now io : { transports : ... } }
[01:50] moshe: well good thing you're telling me this now :)
[01:51] SubStack: also it should use the pubsub emitter style
[01:51] moshe: well, building something really really simple just to see how it works would take long?
[01:51] moshe: I'd really really love to get something working 
[01:52] SubStack: well the chat example works just fine
[01:52] SubStack: it's just not quite idiomatic dnode anymore
[01:52] moshe: you just said it's outdated and should be replaced  :)
[01:52] moshe: well I've used that for a bit
[01:52] SubStack: yes
[01:52] SubStack: it's outdated but it works
[01:53] moshe: id like to change it to what you suggested

[01:56] SubStack: moshe: depends on what you want to do with your chat
[01:56] a2800276_ has joined the channel
[01:56] SubStack: if you want multiple rooms and private messages and that sort of thing the pubsub approach will be easier
[01:57] SubStack: if you just want to have a simple room the existing example should work fine
[01:57] moshe: well I'm still not completely sure because it's for some project I might be working on. basically it's a admin => users chat, no user => user 
[01:58] moshe: I rather use this but I exhausted from chasing new technology all the time, made like 4 chats so far :\

[02:08] SubStack: and omnipresent
[02:09] moshe: thats good to know
[02:09] SubStack: moshe: also there's a dnode-ruby module so you could use that to tie together your node.js and ruby services
[02:09] SubStack: which gets far less love than the node version because I don't use it for anything yet
[02:09] moshe: where I can find that?
[02:09] SubStack: http://github.com/substack/dnode-ruby
[02:10] SubStack: also it's on rubygems

[02:10] SubStack: http://rubygems.org/gems/dnode

[04:31] jmorrisssssss has joined the channel
[04:31] LowValueTarget: mscdex: Simply not working. Looks like the code is using a deprecated method for Router. I fixed that, but then it seems like the router is not populating any routes -- everything 404's
[04:31] jmorrisssssss: anyone know of an inflector module?
[04:31] xeodox: defstream: Because I want to generate a username for each new user along with the current facebook data.
[04:32] xeodox: defstream: So when the module creates the user, I want it to also create a username field , and a "code" field.
[04:32] mscdex: LowValueTarget: oh. well, the author of that module pops in here quite often (JimBastard)
[04:33] mscdex: otherwise maybe create an issue on the github repo

[04:34] defstream: i gotchya
[04:34] defstream: as long as your returning the promising user it shoudln't be a problem

[07:07] JimBastard: nice
[07:07] Aria: brownies: Save it first, send the redirect second?
[07:07] JimBastard: yeah, i forgot to do an npm publish like a month ago
[07:07] JimBastard: webservice.js is a fun library
[07:07] LowValueTarget: Love it. Dont need anything but a few simple webservices. Makes it fast and simple
[07:08] coreb: brownies: mongoose?
[07:08] brownies: coreb: mongous != mongoose unfortunately.
[07:08] brownies: Aria: well the problem is that the save is asynchronous. and the genius who wrote mongous didn't structure it so that save could have a callback.
[07:08] Aria: ... Doh.
[07:09] SubStack: damn really need to work on my dnode slides
[07:09] SubStack: only 1 more week!

[07:12] SubStack: http://substack.net/images/dnode.png
[07:12] JimBastard: whats freestyle?
[07:12] sechrist: that's freestyle
[07:12] sechrist: substack knows what's up
[07:12] JimBastard: SubStack: nice ahaha
[07:13] SubStack: more where that came from
[07:13] SubStack: at nodeconf!
[07:13] sechrist: hmm so I should probably go to work early
[07:13] sechrist: so I can leave earlier than 8
[07:13] sechrist: without feeling like an ass
[07:13] JimBastard: just dont eat a heavy lunch, trust me on that
[07:13] sechrist: early = before 1pm
[07:13] sechrist: oh man I looked up the house of air
[07:14] sechrist: that stuff is sick
[07:14] sechrist: people will get injured :D
[07:14] JimBastard: yes it is
[07:14] SubStack: they'd better
[07:14] isaacs: JimBastard: hey!
[07:14] JimBastard: im bringing one of the interns
[07:14] JimBastard: dont hurt him too badly

[07:14] sechrist: i'll be making sure I don't hurt myself
[07:14] sechrist: there's dodgeball?
[07:14] V1: pff no ninja turtles SubStack?
[07:14] isaacs: any chance that rap'll be done by this weekend?
[07:14] SubStack: not yet
[07:15] isaacs: i wanna put an easter egg in npm
[07:15] SubStack: also if you need art for your nodeconf talk I can hook you up
[07:16] sechrist: isaacs: it's not an easter egg if everybody in #nodejs knows about it lol
[07:17] JimBastard: isaacs: i doubt it, most of my audio gear is in transit. i dont want to rush it
[07:17] coreb: brownies: consider rewriting it to use mongoose, or else you'll need to have a loop with timed callbacks that do the mongodb poll
[07:17] JimBastard: isaacs: im also trying to get zedshaw to drop some guitar licks for the beat

[07:18] SubStack: I should just build some out of crap I find like my place in fairbanks
[07:18] sechrist: all move back
[07:18] brownies: coreb: ouch. so i'd have to do a loop that constantly checks the db to see if the new entry exists, then redirect when true? that sounds so ugly.
[07:19] jesusabdullah: Do they dumpster dive there?
[07:19] SubStack: jesusabdullah: the homeless people pick them over pretty well
[07:19] coreb: brownies: not constantly, timed callbacks
[07:19] micheil has joined the channel
[07:19] SubStack: also the streets are dumpsters on account of the trash pickup
[07:19] brownies: coreb: still sounds ugly.
[07:19] mAritz has joined the channel
[07:19] coreb: usually it would suffice with once or twice, but sure, it gets ugly when you need that and don't have a callback
[07:20] coreb: brownies: so rewrite it to use a callback, your solution is hopeless to begin with
[07:20] brownies: coreb: yup. i blame the other guy, for picking mongous. *grumbles*
[07:21] sechrist: man the house of air is a pain to get to without busses or cars
[07:21] sechrist: i've been spoiled since I moved here

[07:23] sechrist: not epic busy right now
[07:23] sechrist: sure
[07:24] JimBastard: do a

[07:24] sechrist: better question is how old my node is on my actual mac
[07:25] JimBastard: npm will let you know if its < 0.4.0
[07:25] JimBastard: we are requiring that version for jitsu
[07:25] isaacs: sechrist: node -v
[07:25] sechrist: makes sense
[07:25] sechrist: yeah i'm good
[07:25] sechrist: doing it now

[09:15] n2liquid: mscdex: ah..
[09:16] mscdex: bonfo: ok, when you ./configure does it say it found the headers and the function ?

[09:24] moshe: I tried to use the hash libary var Hash = require('hashish'); and I get cannot find module traverse/hanish but I just installed it with npm install traverse and git cloned it ...

[09:26] SubStack: moshe: in what module? traverse/hash went away and became hashish
[09:26] moshe: yeah I noticed
[09:26] moshe: so I should do npm install hanish ?
[09:27] SubStack: where to you get 'cannot find traverse/hash'?
[09:27] moshe: when I try to run pub.js
[09:28] SubStack: so um
[09:28] SubStack: just replace 'traverse/hash' with 'hashish'
[09:28] moshe: I did...

[09:56] moshe: well, do I need to install it again or anything?
[09:56] mscdex: yo
[09:56] BenC[UK]: hey guys, I came accross node.js the other day, and am having a play with it..
[09:56] moshe: when I run web.js I get Error: Cannot find module 'dnode/package.json'
[09:56] moshe:  . I do have json installed tho
[09:56] charliesome has joined the channel
[09:56] mscdex: that's odd
[09:56] BenC[UK]: I've taken the very first example on the nodejs.org website..
[09:57] SubStack: there, updated browserify
[09:57] BenC[UK]: and added a counter into it
[09:57] BenC[UK]: but, its going up in 2's
[09:57] saschagehlich has joined the channel
[09:57] charliesome: BenC[UK]: can i see your code?
[09:57] moshe: so I run install broswerify again?
[09:57] BenC[UK]: code is here: http://pastebin.com/6T5PWyTx
[09:57] mscdex: BenC[UK]: it's probably your browser requesting favicon.ico
[09:57] charliesome: yep
[09:57] BenC[UK]: ah
[09:57] BenC[UK]: duh, stupid browser
[09:58] mscdex: :)
[09:58] BenC[UK]: completely forgot about that
[09:58] charliesome: BenC[UK]: just check that request.uri is "/" and you should be fine
[09:58] mscdex: that one gets new users every time :-D
[09:58] BenC[UK]: thanks
[09:58] moshe: well installation went fine but I still get the Error: Cannot find module 'dnode/package.json'
[09:58] moshe:  ...
[09:58] SubStack: moshe: can you require('dnode') from the repl?
[09:59] moshe: well I could run the client.js example and it uses dnode , so it means yes?
[09:59] sreeix has joined the channel
[09:59] BenC[UK]: hmm, request.uri is undefined
[10:00] mscdex: BenC[UK]: it's request.url

[10:01] BenC[UK]: ok, none more thing then, node.js is single threaded... so with the timers etc.. im guessing its timesliced... ?
[10:02] BenC[UK]: so it gives the appearance of having multiple threads, i.e to handle more than one http connection at a time
[10:02] BenC[UK] has left the channel
[10:02] moshe: SubStack, if I can run client.js it doesn't mean that dnode is working?
[10:03] BenC[UK] has joined the channel
[10:03] BenC[UK]: grr, not used to this irc client, closed the wrong window
[10:03] daglees has joined the channel
[10:04] charliesome: BenC[UK]: node is evented, so it's cooperatively multitasked if you want to think of it like that. if you want proper concurrency, run multiple nodes
[10:05] BenC[UK]: is there  a "standard" way for multiple nodes to talk to one another and share data?
[10:05] BenC[UK]: or, do I need to implement that with memcached or similar?
[10:05] mscdex: BenC[UK]: no standard way, but there's various IPC mechanisms out there
[10:05] charliesome: BenC[UK]: redis is pretty cool for ipc. look into its pub/sub capabilities for evented message passing between nodes
[10:05] mscdex: BenC[UK]: i've used node-webworker before
[10:06] charliesome: BenC[UK]: not sure if there's a better way
[10:06] mscdex: BenC[UK]: you could also use a simple json protocol over tcp or unix sockets with this: https://gist.github.com/880514
[10:07] BenC[UK]: Okay, ill take a look at those, thanks guys
[10:08] mscdex: BenC[UK]: btw, you can handle lots of requests with a single node instance
[10:08] moshe: mscdex, when I install dnode I get npm WARN publish-everything dnode-protocol@0.0.7 Adding entire directory to tarball. Please add a
[10:08] moshe: npm WARN publish-everything dnode-protocol@0.0.7 .npmignore or specify a 'files' array in the package.json . any idea whats wrong?
[10:08] charliesome: mscdex: although if you have multiple cores, there's not really any harm is parallelizing your nodes
[10:08] chapel: or you could use dnode
[10:08] BenC[UK]: mscdex: was more for redundancy than scalabilty
[10:09] mdaisuke: Does anybody know if there's sites explaing about node.js implementation?
[10:09] chapel: charliesome mscdex BenC[UK] dnode :)

[10:10] mscdex: mdaisuke: you mean how node works or how to create c++ addons for node?
[10:10] moshe: sweet, thanks
[10:10] SubStack: that is such crap that npm makes a mess and then complains about the mess it made
[10:10] mdaisuke: mscdex: both of them
[10:10] mscdex: mdaisuke: or just node programming resources in general?
[10:10] moshe: hehe

[10:12] mdaisuke: mscdex: wanna know how it works with implementation
[10:14] mscdex: mdaisuke: i'd watch some of ryah's videos, like: http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/05/20/video-dahl/
[10:14] mdaisuke: guess I need to read the souces but not familier with C++ yet. so if there's sites about it, it will help me

[10:19] jamey-uk: my boss is trying to use node on cygwin but running into problems (which I expected), is this generally loathed and/or less supported than running on mac or linux? if so, which would you prefer out of the two?
[10:19] tbassetto has joined the channel
[10:20] mscdex: jamey-uk: you're probably better off with a linux vm or something instead
[10:20] mscdex: for development
[10:21] mikl has joined the channel
[10:21] mscdex: cygwin has mood swings
[10:21] naneau: is there a way to clear the require() cache?
[10:21] jamey-uk: yep but then he does love windows... so if he was browsing/editing on the host OS and had the guest linux vm mounted or something, is that a slow/ugly solution? have you heard of anyone doing this?
[10:21] charliesome: jamey-uk: i develop on osx and test on an arch linux vm mounted as a samba share
[10:22] charliesome: jamey-uk: works pretty well
[10:22] mscdex: jamey-uk: if you're stuck on windows, then that's your best bet right now
[10:22] jamey-uk: charliesome: cool, so the samba share you find quick enough? and switching to the arch linux or SSHing in, npm'ing and such is quick and easy?
[10:22] azeroth_ has joined the channel
[10:22] charliesome: jamey-uk: i just have a permanent ssh window open
[10:22] jamey-uk: well, he's happy to consider switching to mac or linux given a good case for doing so
[10:22] charliesome: jamey-uk: and the samba is really quick
[10:23] charliesome: jamey-uk: given that it's a local vm
[10:23] jamey-uk: charliesome: any disadvantages you find generally?
[10:23] jamey-uk: yeah
[10:23] jamey-uk: mscdex: btw you just gave me nostalgia, that's the DOS CD tool right?
[10:23] charliesome: jamey-uk: no real disadvantages i've noticed, if you can mount the samba share somewhere convenient it's pretty seamless
[10:23] BenC[UK]: dnode  isnt really what I want - for instance, if I had lots of clients connected, and wanted to be able to relay data between them... regardless if which server node they're connected to.. I need to keep a routing table really
[10:23] mscdex: jamey-uk: more or less :)
[10:23] BenC[UK]: or broadcast to all, but thats not idea
[10:23] BenC[UK]: ideal*
[10:23] jetienne: q. where can i find an example of a command line tool reading the stdin ?
[10:24] mscdex: jetienne: process.stdin.resume(); process.stdin.on('data', callback);
[10:24] jamey-uk: charliesome: cool, he'll be happy with that...! except now he's going to have buy a bigger SSD :)
[10:24] mscdex: :)
[10:24] SubStack: BenC[UK]: are there any modules that let clients talk to each other directly?
[10:24] charliesome: jamey-uk: if you can use an ssd for the vm, that'll make it blindingly fast.
[10:24] SubStack: that would make a good dnode plugin
[10:24] jetienne: mscdex: thanks :)
[10:24] charliesome: jamey-uk: I/O is the biggest killer with vm performance
[10:25] mnbvasd: BenC[UK]: I've got a similar problem, I was looking at implementing a routing algo, have multiple node frontend instances connected to a local router instance, which then connects to other ones...
[10:26] BenC[UK]: yeah, thats my plan also, I've built the system before in c#.net, so was going to port what I have
[10:26] mscdex: ACTION shakes a fist at .NET
[10:27] jamey-uk: charliesome: okay great, looks like he's gonna upgrade to a bigger, faster SSD and VM it up... ooh just noticed ubuntu 11.04 is out today
[10:27] mnbvasd: BenC[UK]: I briefly looked at dijkstra's routing algos, and couldn't get my head around right away, I'm instead considering something nastier.
[10:27] jamey-uk: charliesome: also, out of interest - why do you run it under a vm rather than natively under osx?
[10:27] ardcore has joined the channel
[10:27] mnbvasd: ACTION runs nativly under osx, and nativly on linux(and in vm).
[10:28] charliesome: jamey-uk: i guess i'm just more comfortable with using linux for that stuff. i also dev some other things on the vm that rely on linux
[10:28] ardcore has left the channel
[10:29] charliesome: jamey-uk: although if i were you, rather than using ubuntu, just grab arch linux. node, samba and sshd are all you need
[10:29] charliesome: jamey-uk: ubuntu server could work too.
[10:30] jamey-uk: charliesome: yeah thought so, i'm on ubuntu here and linux makes my life easy. why would you say arch over ubuntu server, is it lighter/faster? would you be using something like macports if you had to dev on osx? (i have a macbook at home)
[10:30] jamey-uk: mnbvasd: cool, which do you find easier or more pleasant, if any?
[10:30] charliesome: jamey-uk: either arch or ubuntu server will be fine. personally i prefer arch because everything in the repos is absolutely up to date.
[10:31] charliesome: jamey-uk: on osx i use brew
[10:31] n2liquid: jamey-uk: there's a very old codebase for the game engine here: http://code.google.com/p/sonetto/
[10:31] jamey-uk: charliesome: up to date meaning latest stable? i guess it'd be important to have same versions as on the live server
[10:31] n2liquid: we're rewriting everything now; that one used Ogre3D, which sucks
[10:32] mnbvasd: jamey-uk: I generally develop in a freenx(kinda like vnc) in a throwaway linux vm on a linux server, but I just use vim in a terminal whatever platform I'm on, and bash/whatever so I notice no difference.
[10:32] jamey-uk: mnbvasd: freenx is like a good version of X11 networking right?
[10:32] mnbvasd: jamey-uk: I just use the freenx session so I can keep it open and identical, even after a laptop reboot etc.
[10:32] jamey-uk: yeah :) I think I set my father up with it when I switched him to linux over christmas ;)
[10:33] mnbvasd: jamey-uk: yes, that you can (dis|re)connect to.
[10:33] charliesome: jamey-uk: arch's repos tend to have the latest 'unstable' versions, although they're not the bleeding edge dev versions so they're pretty stable
[10:33] jamey-uk: I was impressed with the persistent sessions thing, since then you can pause the vm and continue your session regardless of power loss, right?
[10:33] n2liquid: jamey-uk: and a dead blog on sonetto.wordpress.com
[10:33] mnbvasd: jamey-uk: aye
[10:34] n2liquid: jamey-uk: does your friend have anything to show?
[10:36] jamey-uk: mnbvasd: so can you then reconnect locally on that machine, or take over that session locally or something?

[10:37] mnbvasd: jamey-uk: don't have a clue, the box doesn't have a monitor, when I've tried it on other boxes(desktops) I have all kinds of issues, and have ended up firing up x11vnc inside the session and then connecting to that.

[10:37] jamey-uk: mnbvasd: x11vnc working there as a rescuer?
[10:38] jamey-uk: n2liquid: so what role does node play in sonetto?
[10:38] mnbvasd: jamey-uk: just so I can use the session briefly, such as saving data I've not saved.
[10:39] jamey-uk: ah gotcha
[10:39] jamey-uk: charliesome: thanks for brew, looks great, i haven't done much on osx recently :)

[11:10] zubairov has joined the channel
[11:12] n2liquid: and speaking of writing very precious code in JavaScript, is there a way to actually 'compile' JavaScript? I know V8 does it behind the scenes, but I wish I could actually distribute it in binary (pre-compiled) form only

[11:12] jamey-uk: n2liquid: that's a bit mind blowing, so how should I think of how node scripts interfacing with the graphics libraries?
[11:14] n2liquid: jamey-uk: I'm thinking in a way to abstract OpenGL/Direct3D

[13:30] n2liquid: nothing blocks in Node
[13:30] n2liquid: nothing
[13:30] mickaelz: not blocking then
[13:30] n2liquid: so you won't ever get stuck answering a request unless you make a huge loop
[13:31] mickaelz: i mean its still busy with one thing :P
[13:31] n2liquid: nope
[13:31] n2liquid: lemme sketch something up for you
[13:31] n2liquid: just a second
[13:31] mickaelz: thx :)

[13:34] n2liquid: there's an example at the beginning of the page
[13:34] n2liquid: nothing there blocks
[13:34] Jesse__: moshe what route did you take to install Mongodb?
[13:34] moshe: im getting the error error: Cannot find module './ChatSocket' . what am I missing?
[13:34] n2liquid: the function being passed to http.createServer() is called whenever a request comes in
[13:35] moshe: you mean I should be at /user/ instead of /user/chat/ ?
[13:35] n2liquid: it doesn't happen immediately, only when it should (duh)
[13:35] n2liquid: so your function is queued somewhere, waiting for the request
[13:35] n2liquid: then you pick the return from createServer (which returned immediately because node is non-blocking) and tell it to listen on port 1337
[13:35] n2liquid: and that's it
[13:36] n2liquid: your script ends and node keeps listening for incoming connections, handles a bit of the requests and let your callback do the job when it has to
[13:36] mickaelz: i understand
[13:36] n2liquid: as sick as it seems, this model works pretty well and is on par with Apache
[13:37] mickaelz: i know how awesome it is :)
[13:37] mickaelz: the thing is
[13:37] mickaelz: i am trying to use events
[13:37] moshe: wha do you mean Jesse__ ?
[13:37] n2liquid: hm
[13:37] mickaelz: to split the answer
[13:37] n2liquid: split the answer? please elaborate
[13:37] mickaelz: lets say there is many connections cominh
[13:37] mickaelz: g
[13:37] mickaelz: then
[13:37] Jesse__: I mean to you use npm a install script or simply download and compile
[13:37] mickaelz: one of them takes longer

[13:38] bingomanatee has joined the channel
[13:38] n2liquid: mickaelz: could you exemplify? I can't see that happening on Node
[13:39] n2liquid: you shouldn't be doing heavy-lifting in the main thread
[13:39] mickaelz: if i use few events, then it should be able to answer or do some work for other requests right
[13:39] n2liquid: if you want to do something big, afaik you should write an addon in another language and use libev/libeio or spawn another process
[13:40] mickaelz: i am just trying a stupid example
[13:40] mickaelz: a loop
[13:40] n2liquid: right, a loop
[13:40] mickaelz: actually not a loop
[13:40] n2liquid: a slow sloop?
[13:40] n2liquid: huh
[13:40] mickaelz: its just 2 events calling to each other
[13:40] mickaelz: counting to infinite
[13:40] n2liquid: can't picture that
[13:40] mickaelz: in the main 
[13:40] mickaelz: not a process
[13:40] n2liquid: ah
[13:41] mickaelz: like i just want to print 1 to infinite in the console
[13:41] mickaelz: but the server has to be able to answer to a request if any
[13:41] mickaelz: i can do that with process.nextTick
[13:41] mickaelz: its working
[13:41] n2liquid: yeap
[13:41] n2liquid: ok
[13:41] mickaelz: but with eventEmitters it will be just stuck
[13:41] n2liquid: did you try it?
[13:41] mickaelz: i thought events will be fired in the main event lopp
[13:41] mickaelz: loop
[13:42] n2liquid: I see
[13:42] mickaelz: but its just stuck firing these events
[13:42] n2liquid: they're firing as soon as you emit them? that's odd
[13:42] mickaelz: when i do .emit() its going to the main loop right?
[13:42] n2liquid: I thought they would only be fired on the next tick or something
[13:42] mickaelz: i know its odd and ridiculous
[13:42] mickaelz: but its just a test
[13:43] n2liquid: yeah, actually I don't know how to help you there, but I'm curious now
[13:43] n2liquid: emit() fires things
[13:43] n2liquid: and those things happen in the main loop, yup
[13:43] n2liquid: but they shouldn't hang the process
[13:43] moshe: im trying to install mongodb@0.9.2 and I get Checking for node path                   : not found  . anyone please?
[13:43] mickaelz: mayeb i am doing something wrong
[13:43] n2liquid: imho
[13:43] mickaelz: let me try to use that pastebin thing
[13:43] n2liquid: can you paste your code somewhere? gist.github.com?
[13:44] n2liquid: pastebin is overloaded right now

[13:53] mickaelz: yep 2 events firing to each other
[13:53] moshe: what do you mean
[13:54] mickaelz: mosh, maybe try npm install "mongodb@0.9.2"
[13:54] n2liquid: mickaelz: same problem? I mean, did you try having p1 and p2?
[13:54] mickaelz: yep i did :(
[13:54] moshe: with the quotes ?
[13:54] mickaelz: yes with the quotes 
[13:54] mickaelz: both solutions worked for me
[13:55] mickaelz: with and without quotes
[13:55] moshe: well it doesn't for me :\
[13:55] moshe: something is off with my npm or mabe node itself 
[13:55] V1: mickaelz the EventEmitter non blocking
[13:55] V1: isn't*
[13:55] mickaelz: i know it should not be blocking :(
[13:55] V1: It's a regular javascript observer pattern, no fancy pancy non blocking shizzle
[13:56] Jesse__: moshe did the Check for node prefix succeed?
[13:56] n2liquid: V1: I thought that was to be avoided at all costs in Node..?
[13:56] V1: it's blocking because it's just regular javascript
[13:56] Jesse__: and have you setup a quick test to see if the drive is in fact not working?
[13:56] mickaelz: hold on

[13:57] mickaelz: right?
[13:57] Jesse__: I would to a quick test to see if in fact its not working. My install fail on node path aswell and appears to functioning fine
[13:57] Jesse__: do*
[13:57] n2liquid: mickaelz: I think so
[13:57] n2liquid: he means you have to take care of yourself not to block when dealing with EventEmitter
[13:58] mickaelz: i should have looked inside the code maybe
[13:58] V1: yes
[13:58] mickaelz: so it does not fire to the main loop

[14:10] context: node_path != path.
[14:10] strzel_a has joined the channel
[14:10] n2liquid: so NODE_PATH shouldn't be needed, imo
[14:10] n2liquid: hm
[14:10] n2liquid: odd
[14:10] mickaelz: it returns empty as well and i can install
[14:10] n2liquid: since I didn't have to set that
[14:10] context: and.... npm is NOT node.
[14:10] context: you are telling NODE where NPM installed stuff.
[14:10] n2liquid: ahh
[14:10] n2liquid: er, wait
[14:10] n2liquid: that doesn't make any sense
[14:11] mickaelz: but i dont have NODE_PATH and its working for me
[14:11] criswell has joined the channel
[14:11] V1: moshe, it doesn't matter that it says `Checking for node path                   : not found ` as long as the module is installing correctly, and npm ends with OK
[14:11] mickaelz: i think NPM is just putting the module at the right place for node
[14:11] context: mickaelz: which node
[14:11] V1: you can just ignore that line completely
[14:11] moshe: well id like to think that too
[14:11] brianc has joined the channel
[14:11] moshe: but I get problems all the time later on
[14:11] moshe: like pretty much everytime I use some module ...
[14:12] V1: what error?
[14:12] mickaelz: node 4.
[14:12] V1: Your error might not even be related to that
[14:12] moshe: well
[14:12] moshe: yesterday for example I was trying dnode 
[14:12] moshe: and had trouble too
[14:12] context: mickaelz: node , then require.paths and pastie.org what it says
[14:13] moshe: luckily substack was here to change the files
[14:13] mickaelz: moshe are you using sudo ? or have you tried as root?
[14:13] context: so you use npm modules without NODE_PATH set ?
[14:13] moshe: so it installed correctly 
[14:13] moshe: sudo, i havent tried as root
[14:13] moshe: i was asking how to try as root....
[14:13] __tomb has joined the channel
[14:13] mickaelz: su ?
[14:13] V1: can you give me an example of the error. You only stated that you have `errors` but you are not telling us the actual error
[14:13] JulioBarros has joined the channel
[14:13] mickaelz: context hold on
[14:14] V1: the mongodb plugin can install perfectly fine when it raises the `Checking for node path                   : not found ` during installation.
[14:14] moshe: hmm let me see
[14:14] dmcquay has joined the channel
[14:14] context: if you have npm installed locally or running as a user and not root it will install to your home
[14:14] context: err hmm
[14:14] moshe: so it's ok context?
[14:14] context: mine might work without node_path too.
[14:15] context: nope.
[14:15] context: my node works.
[14:15] V1: or maby you are only installing the module locally and attempting to use it globally
[14:15] moshe: V1 I don't remember which errors but I'm sure SubStack does, when he gets here I'll ask him
[14:15] V1: So there are no errors atm?
[14:15] context: i have node installed through homebrew, npm manually of course

[14:16] deputydink has left the channel
[14:16] moshe: when I do node main.js I get Error: Cannot find module './ChatSocket'
[14:16] mickaelz: context: [ '/home/mike/.node_modules', '/home/mike/.node_libraries', '/usr/local/lib/node' ]
[14:16] mickaelz: if its what you ask for :/
[14:16] moshe: which module am I missing?
[14:16] V1: thats because there is an error in the code
[14:16] V1: it's not called ChatSocket but chatSocket
[14:17] V1: it has nothing to do with your installation
[14:17] moshe: oh
[14:17] context: mickaelz: yeah i had to put /usr/local/lib/node in manually.
[14:17] V1: it's a bug in chat.io
[14:17] moshe: wait I was saying it was related...
[14:17] moshe: I was just wondering but I'm having this all the time and figured might try to fix that

[14:17] gorkson has joined the channel

[14:19] V1: I'm just saying you probalby wont have any issues with your node and npm installation as some modules trend to be buggy and not build with a propper test suite

[14:23] V1: it just dies.
[14:23] V1: (if you don't capture it)
[14:23] context: v1: yes. and you will get an error saying the port is in use
[14:24] V1: that is exactly the error that moshe is getting context :p
[14:24] context: oh. im backlogged :x
[14:25] Jesse__: be sure to end the server with Ctrl+C not Ctrl+x as it will continue to run

[14:43] Remoun: context: other server setups? e.g.python+twisted/orbited, and/or whatever else is out there (I'm not that familiar with all the options, TBH)
[14:44] context: and the point of that would be
[14:44] V1: You are gonna get a biased answer, we are all gonna say node
[14:44] V1: and when you go a python channel
[14:44] V1: they are all gonna say twisted+python
[14:44] context: well his question is rather vague. 
[14:44] V1: :D
[14:44] Remoun: I'm rather biased myself :)
[14:44] context: is he compared languages, IO libs, event libs, comet libs?
[14:44] Remoun: so I'm looking for some actual numbers to present
[14:44] context: all of the above at once?
[14:45] V1: It all depends on the application you are gonna build. a `comet` styled application can be allot of things
[14:45] context: language impl ?
[14:45] Remoun: true
[14:45] V1: Soo, whatca building

[14:50] jamey-uk has left the channel
[14:50] context: yes. you are giving us way to much detail.
[14:50] moshe: well I get 28 Apr 17:41:02 - socket.io ready - accepting connections
[14:50] V1: Remoun how many users per server are you targetting and does it have to be `comet` or just anything that makes it realtime
[14:50] context: remoun: im slightly mocking. you pretty much just reworded what you already said
[14:50] sourcode has joined the channel
[14:50] moshe: and when I loca localhost:8080 its a blank page, maybe I need to load something else?
[14:51] V1: moshe: the readme says port 3000
[14:51] moshe: whopsy, noticed now
[14:51] context: remoun: and how important are these numbers as appose to all the other questions.

[14:52] moshe: in the actual cht I see the name
[14:53] context: remoun: is node really the proper answer for the problem, is it gonna jive with what you already have, development costs, maintenance, deployability. if you're a shop with 500 .net developers nodejs i doubt is the answer
[14:53] moshe: need to look for it's code
[14:53] markwubben has joined the channel
[14:53] devdazed has joined the channel
[14:53] Remoun: V1; trying to maximise number of users per server, obviously; what other options are there for making it realtime?
[14:53] V1: moshe: Well atleast the app is working,
[14:53] moshe: yes, thats a good start
[14:54] Remoun: context; yeah, that's what I'm trying to assess, especially the maintenance and deployment aspects
[14:54] context: remoun: so if java handles 50 more users per server you are gonna go with that?
[14:54] V1: Well most of node users, use Socket.IO as realtime option, which doesn't strictly implement the comet specification
[14:54] tbranyen_: comet specification?
[14:54] tbranyen_: you mean websocket?
[14:54] context: Faye does websocket with fallback to jsonp and comet. but thats beyond the point. 
[14:55] V1: bayeux protocol

[14:55] tbranyen_: V1: never heard of that weird
[14:55] DennisRas has joined the channel
[14:56] V1: but comet is basically just an umbrella term.. but it's usually associated with realtime servers that use the bayeux protocol
[14:56] Remoun: V1; Yeah, Socket.IO seems like the most... convenient? option for the realtime stuff
[14:56] tbranyen_: V1: yeah thats what i've always thought
[14:56] context: remoun: but which is gonna cost more. the 6 more months of development, or buying 1 more server.
[14:56] arpegius has joined the channel
[14:56] tbranyen_: in 2006 COMET meant holding long connections and encompassing long polling
[14:56] axl_ has joined the channel

[14:57] context: not too many words change definition over time. even ajax has kept its meaning over the years

If it really needs to know that it's a child of your Node process, you should probably /tell/ it so in the args.

[16:05] tjholowaychuk: stagas; mostly yeah, just doesn't respond for you

[16:07] wilmoore has joined the channel
[16:07] boghog: EyePulp, ah yeah, I guess that is the most simplest, though would that still let me require() it when the file is stored under say $HOME/.myapp/config.js ? i guess I need to read up on how require() works 
[16:07] EyePulp: I did extend it to allow for "local" settings, which then can override the standard settings used in production

[16:17] tjholowaychuk: yeah sure
[16:17] nphase: theres request.headers.host, but theres no request.headers.port
[16:18] nphase: how do i get the port being requested on?
[16:18] remysharp: I've generated an app in an empty directory using the express cmd line tool
[16:18] remysharp: it tells me to install jade
[16:18] cm: ACTION dies
[16:18] remysharp: which I do

[16:18] remysharp: I've forced jade to install in ./node_modules/jade
[16:18] zubairov_ has joined the channel
[16:18] remysharp: (because it's going in the parent directory for some reason)
[16:18] remysharp: and when I start it up - I get 500 err saying it can't find jade
[16:19] remysharp: tested with node 0.5.0pre and 0.4.7 - same issue
[16:19] tjholowaychuk: remysharp: hmm, yeah if node can find it, it should work fine
[16:19] tjholowaychuk: I'm not on the recent npm yet
[16:19] Mrfloyd has joined the channel
[16:19] tjholowaychuk: so im not sure whats going on
[16:19] remysharp: yeah, I'm on the new npm
[16:19] remysharp: which might be what's screwing things up...
[16:19] remysharp: I'll see if I can load jade just from node by itself
[16:19] tjholowaychuk: as long as it's in ./node_modules it should work I would think
[16:20] remysharp: ah...node -e 'require("jade")' chucking error

[16:20] remysharp: but I've got a node_modules directory and in there is the jade module directory

[16:31] nefD has joined the channel
[16:31] remysharp: tjholowaychuk: npm installs "locally" by default
[16:31] tjholowaychuk: should still work

[16:31] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[16:31] stagas: mscdex: but the modules wouldn't do that unless they're aware of your main script :)
[16:31] tjholowaychuk: remysharp: require() should still grab that AFAIK
[16:31] remysharp: but the require for jade is happening in a deeper directory

[16:32] JJMalina has joined the channel
[16:33] tjholowaychuk: remysharp: shit haha, maybe the new stuff just fucks over how express does the requires for the template engines

[16:33] remysharp: yeah, that's *exactly* what I would have thought too
[16:33] nphase: how do i get the port number from an http request?

[16:56] LowValueTarget: dont think it exists in the scope of the webservice method
[16:56] remysharp: tjholowaychuk: okay, I think I've got it now - express is installed globally - so it's looking for jade globally
[16:57] dmcquay has joined the channel
[16:57] tjholowaychuk: remysharp: ohhhhh
[16:57] remysharp: tjholowaychuk: which is why installing jade globally fixes it.
[16:57] tjholowaychuk: makes sense
[16:57] remysharp: tjholowaychuk: basically, update the build script to say npm install jade -g (but then...if it's installed locally... hmm - possible mess - just have to detect some install location I guess)
[16:57] LowValueTarget: no worries now mscdex, just realized i have a meeting. I'll bbl
[16:58] remysharp: I've had to update the readme on my node apps (as they're all command line) to say -g
[16:58] isaacs: remysharp: why do you need to install jade globally
[16:58] isaacs: ?
[16:58] remysharp: ::sigh::
[16:58] tjholowaychuk: remysharp: yeah kinda confusing i guess since the executable would be installed globally
[16:58] tjholowaychuk: hmm
[16:58] remysharp: isaacs: because express was installed globally
[16:58] jbpros has joined the channel
[16:58] nvardar has joined the channel
[16:58] remysharp: isaacs: so it couldn't find jade locally
[16:58] isaacs: oh, and you linked express, so when it' realpaths, jade isn't in the node_modules path
[16:58] tjholowaychuk: remysharp: ideally you woudl have the executable globally but not express
[16:58] Aikar: any ubuntu junkies in here?
[16:58] tjholowaychuk: but i can see that getting a bit confusing
[16:58] mscdex: you sound so jaded

[16:59] Aikar: mscdex: what did ya need
[16:59] tjholowaychuk: mscdex: http://www.google.ca/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=jade
[16:59] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: yeah, express is a bit of an odd duck in that way.  it's a cli app, but really *primarily* a require()-able lib
[16:59] tjholowaychuk: oddly
[16:59] tjholowaychuk: its on the first page
[16:59] tjholowaychuk: haha
[16:59] remysharp: isaacs: jade is in the node_modules path - but in the local one - but express is reading from a different location
[16:59] isaacs: remysharp: right.  express is linked in
[16:59] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: I have a few like that

[16:59] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[16:59] isaacs: right
[16:59] sirkitre_ has joined the channel
[16:59] isaacs: you could do:  npm install jade --prefix ./node_modules/express
[17:00] mscdex: Aikar: oh, there were a few typos in your wormhole readme that i saw last night
[17:00] isaacs: or: npm explore express -- npm install jade
[17:00] mscdex: Aikar: also, i use ubuntu
[17:00] isaacs: (same thing, basically
[17:00] Aikar: mscdex: submit a patch :P i suck at english
[17:00] Aikar: mscdex: i have a really specific technical issue right now lol
[17:00] remysharp: isaacs: yeah - basically shows up that I've only really used npm for installing - rather than anything much more :(
[17:00] Aikar: suck at grammar*
[17:00] isaacs: remysharp: that's ok, it's what it does best :)

[17:02] Aikar: i use a laptop at work, with 2 external monitors, one monitor is using display port which turns off the laptops screen when using it. well power just went out, and only way i know to get a gui back to laptop screen is to restart X. however I dont know what all i had open that may be unsaved so would rather not do that. switching to a TTY (control + alt + F1) gave me a screen on laptop screen, but the TTY7 wont go to laptop. so i wanted options on how i can move 
[17:02] remysharp: isaacs: that previous command, should I have run: "npm explore express" or "npm explore express -- npm install jade" (sorry if that's a dumb question)
[17:02] techwraith: v8: console.log('techwraith++');

[17:03] isaacs: remysharp: or is it JUST installed globally?
[17:03] remysharp: isaacs: no - just installed globally
[17:04] isaacs: remysharp: oh.  well, that's why require("express") won't work then
[17:04] remysharp: that does work tho
[17:04] zed0: Aikar: Copy *~ in the directories you were working in to somewhere?
[17:04] isaacs: remysharp: if you've added the global root to your NODE_PATH, then.... don't do that.
[17:04] rmustacc: So unfortunately with the way X works there isn't a way to move the display back to the local laptop display.
[17:04] Aikar: damn
[17:04] rmustacc: That sucks, I'm sorry.
[17:04] isaacs: remysharp: just install locally.  otherwise you have to install *everything* globally, which is back to the Bad Old Days of npm 0.x
[17:05] rmustacc: Well, actually, you may be able to do some magic with xrandr these days.
[17:05] remysharp: isaacs: and don't have NODE_PATH in my env... sorry, I'm now in utter noob mode :(
[17:05] Aikar: thats what i was wondering rmustacc 
[17:05] rmustacc: What video card / driver / distro
[17:05] Aikar: but i have no idea how to use xrandr
[17:05] isaacs: remysharp: ok.  let's start over.  what version of npm do you have?  1.0.something?
[17:05] remysharp: 1.0final
[17:05] isaacs: remysharp: and you did `npm install express -g`?
[17:05] Aikar: its dell latitude E6410 ubuntu 10.10 x64 nvidia I950 or so?
[17:05] nphase: okay. so request.socket.port should work?
[17:05] duncanbeevers: Can you just move the laptop and the two monitors to another location with power?
[17:05] hij1nx has joined the channel

[17:06] creationix has joined the channel
[17:06] remysharp: isaacs: okay, I've just moved to FINAL, but when I was on npm 0.x I did npm install express (which I gather is implicit global)
[17:06] creationix: isaacs: ping
[17:06] isaacs: remysharp: there ya go!!
[17:06] rmustacc: Okay, take a look at nvidia-settings program and/or xrandr
[17:06] Aikar: rmustacc: i have no gui, only got a terminal atm lol
[17:06] rmustacc: nvidia-settings may be able to move it back without a reset.
[17:06] zed0: Aikar: Flee to somewhere with working power where you can plug in another monitor?
[17:06] isaacs: remysharp: ok.  do `npm install express` again.  or `npm link express` if you prefer.  then the other things i said above will make sense.
[17:06] Aikar: zed0: apparently entire area is out
[17:06] isaacs: creationix: hey :)
[17:06] rmustacc: Yeah, those should work from the command line

[17:07] isaacs: remysharp: it may complain about clobbering a file.  if it does that, just --force it, and it'll shut up
[17:07] creationix: isaacs: npm can be used to simply specify dependencies for an app right
[17:07] Aikar: i live in NC, big storm coming through
[17:07] creationix: even if that app isn't in the repository
[17:07] arpegius has joined the channel
[17:07] nphase: yeah, i'm not seeingr request.socket.port
[17:07] remysharp: isaacs: ok. I'm going to uninstall express too and run those commands
[17:07] isaacs: creationix: well, more precisely, package.json can be used for that purpose.
[17:07] isaacs: creationix: but yeah, publishing is 100% optional.
[17:07] tjholowaychuk: creationix: we use it for learnboost
[17:07] tjholowaychuk: with private: true
[17:07] creationix: ok, so I write a package.json and then some npm command will install it's deps
[17:08] petermanser_ has joined the channel
[17:08] isaacs: creationix: yeah.  in 1.0, it's "npm install" (no args)
[17:08] isaacs: in the package dir
[17:08] thalll has joined the channel
[17:08] isaacs: in 0.x, that was "npm bundle"
[17:08] isaacs: (and it sucked)
[17:08] creationix: isaacs: ok, so it won't try to install the app as a library anywere?
[17:08] isaacs: creationix: "npm install -g" will install it into your global folder.  (like the 0.x "npm install .")
[17:09] isaacs: creationix: but just a local install with no args will install the versions of everything specified in your package.json
[17:09] creationix: that's neat
[17:09] isaacs: :)
[17:09] creationix: so I'm adding a sample app to one of my projects, but the sample has some dependencies
[17:09] isaacs: an implicit install will also leave any existing dependencies alone.
[17:10] isaacs: so if you did a git checkout or whatever, that'll be "safe"

[17:12] isaacs: creationix: `npm init` might be helpful there.  just bang on the enter key to accept the defaults.
[17:12] remysharp: isaacs: yet it is installed under the old npm 0.3 lib directory
[17:12] isaacs: remysharp: yeah, because npm 1.0 doesn't know about that directory
[17:12] paolodedios has joined the channel

[17:13] halfhalo: ACTION actually has a site up built from node! http://REDACTED.preyourmind.org.  More of a teaser site atm
[17:13] isaacs: remysharp: i'd recommend doing the following:  1. curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh  2. npm rm express (and whatever else)  3. npm rm npm  4. curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | npm_install=rc sh  5. npm install express  (or npm link express, if you prefer)
[17:13] MikhX has joined the channel
[17:13] remysharp: isaacs: is there anything to import those modules so that npm1 know about them?
[17:13] isaacs: remysharp: not really.  it's a pretty radically different folder structure.
[17:14] techwraith: isaacs, so updating to 1.0 will blow away people's modules? (or, rather, npm will forget about preinstalled ones?)
[17:14] remysharp: isaacs: cheers - I'm happy with turfing everything out of my modules, that's not a problem
[17:14] remysharp: techwraith: it doesn't blow them away, but it doesn't know about them

[17:14] moshe: after I push to git, is there anything else I should do? 
[17:14] techwraith: ok, cool :)
[17:14] moshe: I cant see any other file besides the readme..:(
[17:14] isaacs: techwraith: yes.  npm will leave them there.  they'll still work.  i need to write a little upgrade script, i guess.
[17:15] creationix: isaacs: right, I forgot about npm init
[17:15] techwraith: yeah, I think an upgrade script would be awesome
[17:15] isaacs: techwraith: or maybe just a "clean up everythign everywhere"
[17:15] drudge: npm init never works right for me :/
[17:15] creationix: ACTION is compiling node v0.4.7 with latest npm...
[17:16] drudge: asks me all the questions and then doesn't generate the file
[17:16] isaacs: techwraith: i don't know.  do you think it would be ok to say "when you install npm 1.0, it deletes all your old installed modules"?
[17:16] isaacs: techwraith: i've gone the path of "least harm", i suppose.
[17:16] remysharp: isaacs: I'd expect it to import the old modules so it "knows" about them
[17:16] isaacs: but that path involves leaving behind litter ;)
[17:16] isaacs: remysharp: not possible.
[17:16] techwraith: Isaacs: that's a good point
[17:16] creationix: hmm, I only have npm 0.3.18
[17:16] creationix: is there a special way to get latest?
[17:17] isaacs: remysharp: i mean, actually not possible.  it is undetermined whether you installed things because you had to, or as deps, or if they should be local, etc.
[17:17] techwraith: Isaacs: is there a way to get a globally installed modules to be packaged locally?
[17:17] isaacs: creationix: curl .. | npm_install=rc sh

[17:17] techwraith: lol, looks like it's Isaacs Q&A hour ;)
[17:17] isaacs: nah, that's at 4-6
[17:17] remysharp: isaacs: okay, it doesn't particularly need a script - only something in the readme so it's clear that npm can't see previously installed modules
[17:18] remysharp: I'm still trying to understand exactly why express couldn't see the locally installed jade

[17:18] newy has joined the channel
[17:18] creationix: sweet, it's working
[17:18] isaacs: remysharp: yeah, i'll write a blog post today on it, and include that in the release announcement (and maybe print a link to it if the install script sees you're going from 0.3 to 1.0)
[17:19] remysharp: definitely think it'll be worth it
[17:19] isaacs: remysharp: because jade isn't in express's module lookup path
[17:19] remysharp: isaacs: right - but because it was in my "local" node_modules I thought it should be able to see it
[17:19] isaacs: remysharp, techwraith: ok, i think that's the answer, then.  just solve this with docs, and maybe a little "run this command to clean up" kinda deal.
[17:19] remysharp: and when I installed express via npm 1 it was fine
[17:20] jtsnow has joined the channel
[17:20] isaacs: remysharp: if you installe xpress and jade in the same node_modules folder, then they can see each other.
[17:20] remysharp: isaacs: absolutely - but that wasn't my set up :)
[17:20] ryankirkman has joined the channel
[17:20] isaacs: remysharp: if you install express globally, and then link it locally, it'll be using the node_modules lookup based on where it actually is, not where it's linked to.
[17:20] remysharp: I *ran* express to generate the app directory
[17:21] remysharp: the express binary suggested I install jade
[17:21] remysharp: which I did
[17:21] isaacs: remysharp: ok.
[17:21] remysharp: and then the fun bagan
[17:21] remysharp: *began
[17:21] remysharp: and by fun...
[17:21] remysharp: I mean headfucking
[17:21] creationix: isaacs: how do you do entry point for compiled extensions?
[17:21] baoist has joined the channel
[17:21] tjholowaychuk: remysharp: the confusing part I think will be explaining to install express with -g, and then install it without -g
[17:21] isaacs: creationix: "main" : "./module"?
[17:21] tjholowaychuk: so that it works for the generated app
[17:22] techwraith: tjholowaychuk, remysharp: yeah, gotta do both ;)
[17:22] creationix: isaacs: so just reference the symlink that node-waf will create?
[17:22] isaacs: creationix: i usually do the minimum required in c++, then wrap it in a "nicer" js layer.
[17:22] tykelewis has joined the channel
[17:22] isaacs: creationix: but you can do "main" : "./build/default/foo.node", if you like
[17:22] isaacs: whatever node-waf builds
[17:22] creationix: will npm call node-waf configure build for the user?
[17:23] isaacs: creationix: if npm sees a wscript with a configure and build step, yes.
[17:23] remysharp: tjholowaychuk: yeah, that's the problem/mindfuck with the entire transition to the new npm - it makes sense (to me), but it's not what you're used to
[17:23] isaacs: creationix: or you can do "scripts" : { "preinstall" : "do some stuff" }
[17:23] creationix: I'm fine with generic wscript
[17:23] Rixius has joined the channel
[17:23] tjholowaychuk: remysharp: yeah it definitely makes sense
[17:23] isaacs: creationix: scripts are passed through sh, so you can do funky stuff like "blerg || true && echo 'yo'"

[17:37] brianc: mnbvasd: playing with it now
[17:37] tbranyen: especially since websockets are still disabled by default in some browsers
[17:37] mnbvasd: brainiac/tjholowaychuk/anyone is there any nice ipc built in, I can see some for communicating pre-defined signals but I was wondering if there's an easy way to implement message passing without a plugin, or another dependency..
[17:37] tjholowaychuk: brianc: what was the perm error you were getting?
[17:37] a|i: tbranyen: this is very confusing: my rails app running under localhost gets websocket, under production server it gets long poling, both localhost, and the production server render extactly the same page to the end client!
[17:37] brianc: tjholowaychuk: sorry to be a n00b...where the user/group option at?
[17:38] tjholowaychuk: mnbvasd: no, it's not an IPC library
[17:38] tjholowaychuk: mnbvasd: typically you should use something else

[17:39] tjholowaychuk: what?
[17:39] tjholowaychuk: haha
[17:39] tjholowaychuk: cluster does IPC yes, but it's not public api
[17:40] V1: a|i: Yup, it's quite large and can be improved. I think its mainly bloated because it uses Flex instead of pure actionscript

[17:42] V1: Juggernaut or jaugrnaut
[17:42] tjholowaychuk: brianc: ah, yeah ok makes sense. the worker would be trying to connect to the socket master created
[17:43] halfhalo: jeagernaut
[17:43] brianc: tjholowaychuk: ah okay
[17:43] tjholowaychuk: brianc: using the settings they are applied on "listening" so it should work
[17:43] tbranyen: a|i: have you tried it?
[17:43] a|i: tbranyen: that juggerwhatever is not reliable, was dead for 2 years, the developer might break up wit the gf and not be in the mood to continue it
[17:44] a|i: it's a pitty node doesn't come with an official pus engine.
[17:44] a|i: push*
[17:44] V1: The only decent other flash fallback that I found is : https://github.com/y8/websocket-flash-js

[17:52] V1: a|i it doesn't die, the server closes the connection on purpose
[17:52] V1: because a heartbeat is send
[17:52] tjholowaychuk: brianc: hmm maybe gist that one. we run cluster on 80

[17:54] mscdex: why would you send heartbeats on a longpoll ?
[17:54] V1: these heartbeats are about each 20 second
[17:54] mscdex: you'd detect the disconnection right away
[17:54] mscdex: ?
[17:55] a|i: V1: yes yes ok, but why does the server close the connection?1 my browser is still open
[17:55] Aikar: mscdex: odd, looks like you gotta manually specify the author on commit, https://github.com/aikar/wormhole/commit/00f70efc7f93f04043f72dc2d5939a77e6482d72
[17:55] V1: a|i just like a regular xhr request, the long poll is answered so connection is closed as you can use Longpolling to `stream` data like xhr-multipart allows
[17:55] uho has joined the channel
[17:55] V1: a|i after the connection is answerd the socket.io client will just create a new connection to the server again.

[17:55] mjr_: you have to heartbeat all long-lived connections, or else you don't know if they are still working thanks to firewalls and other network elements.
[17:56] Aikar: mscdex: was that not your github user? it didnt link to your username

[18:10] creationix: do people generally include samples and docs in the npm module, or should I filter those out with .npmignore?
[18:10] isaacs: creationix: usually everythign gets included.
[18:11] creationix: cool, I published my first native extension
[18:11] isaacs: creationix: it's fine.  the `npm explore` command actually drops you into the pacakge folder, so having examples and stuff in there is good.
[18:11] creationix: renamed it to topcube since webapp was taken
[18:11] isaacs: nice
[18:11] creationix: only works on linux I'm sure, but it's a fun extension
[18:11] isaacs: the thing about landgrabs: everyone rushes to the obvious names, and those are everybody's first projects, so they're kinda lame.
[18:11] isaacs: abandoned, etc.

[18:21] c4milo: tjholowaychuk: a quick question, what's the difference in performance between using expressjs and nodejs http core api 
[18:22] tjholowaychuk: c4milo: nothing really, slight overhead with routing
[18:22] tjholowaychuk: and thats it
[18:22] tjholowaychuk: depending on what you use of course
[18:22] josefrichter_ has joined the channel
[18:22] c4milo: tjholowaychuk: http streaming 
[18:22] tjholowaychuk: that would be the same
[18:22] c4milo: tjholowaychuk: alright, thanks man 
[18:22] tjholowaychuk: express doesn't touch res.write() etc
[18:23] c4milo: and connect? 
[18:23] jeremyselier: wow I just get a weird bug with connect and node 0.4.7
[18:23] jeremyselier: at MongoStore.regenerate (/usr/local/lib/node/.npm/connect/1.2.1/package/lib/middleware/session/store.js:34:8)
[18:23] jeremyselier:     at /usr/local/lib/node/.npm/connect/1.4.0/package/lib/middleware/session.js:325:15
[18:23] tjholowaychuk: c4milo: I dont believe any of the core middleware do either
[18:23] jeremyselier: picking into two different versions does not seems correct, right?
[18:23] josefrichter_: guys, having problem with npm update npm, throws error saying it cannot find some module: http://pastie.org/1844326 any ideas please?
[18:23] c4milo: tjholowaychuk: got it 
[18:24] c4milo: tjholowaychuk: if I have cluster does it affect somehow the http streaming? 
[18:24] tjholowaychuk: jeremyselier: hmm maybe connect-mongodb or w/e has connect as a dep
[18:24] tjholowaychuk: c4milo: not at all no
[18:24] c4milo: tjholowaychuk: nice, tks

[18:26] ryah: oops

[18:28] jeremyselier: of course removing connect@1.2.1 from my machine fix the problem but still
[18:28] tjholowaychuk: jeremyselier: for plugin-ish modules it usually doesnt work out to well to have them as a dep

[18:28] nibblebot has joined the channel
[18:28] nibblebot has left the channel
[18:28] jeremyselier: so you suggest I move connect-mongo into my node-Modules instead of using npm ?
[18:28] tjholowaychuk: and connect-redis only has "redis"
[18:28] nibblebot has joined the channel
[18:29] tjholowaychuk: the problem is that npm will give you a separate module
[18:29] tjholowaychuk: regardless of something else in your deps
[18:29] tjholowaychuk: satisfying that same dep
[18:29] onre_ has joined the channel
[18:30] tjholowaychuk: all the plugin-ish modules will suffer from this

[18:43] sstephenson: i just checked the source, and it looks like it reads up to the start position
[18:43] joeshaw: sstephenson: i had hacked that up in a local branch, not sure if i ever pushed it to my github

[18:45] creationix: is there a proper way to package client-side modules as stack/connect compatable middleware
[18:45] creationix: like, for example mount backbone.js to "/backbone/*" in an http server?
[18:45] sstephenson: perfect. thanks joeshaw 
[18:45] jarek: afair there were some commonjs standards for this
[18:45] jarek: creationix^
[18:45] creationix: jarek: Interesting, have a link
[18:46] SubStack: isaacs: can npm either not include the node_modules directory or not include directories within node_modules which are already listed as dependencies?
[18:46] creationix: they probably don't fit with connect/stack style middleware, but it would be a good place to see what was done before
[18:46] isaacs: SubStack: that's how it works now
[18:46] SubStack: did that change land recently?
[18:46] isaacs: SubStack: it skips over any node_modules/* that aren't in the "bundledDependencies":["list"]

[18:46] cloudhea2 has joined the channel
[18:47] jarek: creationix I have probably misunderstood your question
[18:48] jarek: creating you would like to keep the client side code together with node.js modules?
[18:48] jarek: s/creating/creationix
[18:48] creationix: jarek: I have a Stack middleware server running in node, and I want to leverage npm's dependency system so I don't have to bundle backbone with my client-side code
[18:49] creationix: today, you can install backbone with npm and it will just put the files under node_modules
[18:49] creationix: I want something a little more integrated where I can require a module and get back a middleware that serves backbone
[18:50] admc1 has joined the channel
[18:50] creationix: and pulling in jquery grabs htmlparser, request, mjsunit, and jsdom

[18:51] jarek: creationix I see... Browserify module seems to be providing such functionality
[18:51] jarek: creationix but there are very few modules that support it right now
[18:51] tjholowaychuk: creationix: personally I prefer to manage the CS scripts so that my compression libs can do their thing
[18:51] tjholowaychuk: the only other one i know that does that is socket.io
[18:51] techwraith has joined the channel
[18:51] tjholowaychuk: but yeah it's just /socketio/whatever

[18:52] SubStack: algorithmic modules work as-is usually
[18:53] creationix: hmm
[18:53] creationix: is there an npm runtime api to get the path to where a module is loaded
[18:54] creationix: I can't require browser-side code from node
[18:54] SubStack: require.resolve
[18:54] jarek: creationix you can
[18:55] jarek: crationix I have myself implemented a simple script that allows me for using require() from client-side code
[18:55] creationix: well, I don't need to require browser-side code, I just need to know where it's at so I can server it over http
[18:55] creationix: I don't have a server-side dom
[18:55] jarek: creationix ok, give me a second
[18:55] jarek: I will look for a snippet
[18:55] creationix: require.resolve seems to do what I need
[18:55] tjholowaychuk: wait no because they modify it, god damnit
[18:56] jarek: oh, great :)
[18:56] creationix: require.resolve('backbone') gives '/home/tim/Desktop/topcube/sampleapp/node_modules/backbone/backbone.js'

[21:13] themiddleman_itv: very good news :D
[21:14] dunpeal: Hey. I'm considering Node.js for a project, so going over the docs, and wondering: it seems like most of the API is non-OOP?
[21:14] dunpeal: for example, all file interaction happens via the "fs" module, which is just a collection of static functions.
[21:14] coreb: that gave me express 2.3.2
[21:14] coreb: npm is great
[21:14] tjholowaychuk: dunpeal: a lot of it is lower-level stuff yeah
[21:14] techwraith: dunpeal: JS isn't really OOP to begin with
[21:14] tjholowaychuk: dunpeal: IMO thats the best way to build a project though
[21:14] dunpeal: Since JS is OO, why not define a File class for example?
[21:15] isaacs: techwraith, dunpeal: JS is OO
[21:15] tjholowaychuk: start with the simple low level stuff and build up to these fancy apis
[21:15] indexzero has joined the channel
[21:15] isaacs: dunpeal: have you seen fs.createReadStream and fs.createWriteStream?
[21:15] techwraith: isaacs: I think it can be argued either way
[21:15] tjholowaychuk: dunpeal: if you start with the big, you cant break it down. start with the small, and build it up
[21:15] isaacs: dunpeal: most objects in node are EventEmitters.  there are also server objects, request objects, response objects, etc.
[21:15] sugardave has joined the channel
[21:15] isaacs: techwraith: JS is more OOP than Java.  *everything* is an object (sorrta)
[21:15] dunpeal: isaacs: yeah, but the vast majority of the API is still non-OO
[21:16] isaacs: dunpeal: depends on what you're doing
[21:16] Borre-go has joined the channel
[21:16] jonaslund: OO for the sake of OO is just stupid
[21:16] marlun: isaacs: I did sudo npm uninstall npm -g and the rm -rf /usr/local/{lib/node,lib/node/.npm,bin,share/man}/npm* but there are still a npm folder in /usr/local/share/npm with a bin folder full of files. Should I remove it too?
[21:16] tswicegood: ACTION resists urge to join OOP/JS debate...
[21:16] isaacs: marlun: yeah, i don't really know what that is.  homebrew, maybe?
[21:16] isaacs: tswicegood: jump in, dude!
[21:16] coreb: shouldn't need to sudo npm
[21:17] tswicegood: isaacs: I've got stuff to finish this afternoon... :-)
[21:17] techwraith: if you don't include inheritance as part of the definition of oo, then yes, js is oo
[21:17] isaacs: JS is functional and prototypal
[21:17] hij1nx has joined the channel
[21:17] isaacs: coreb: sudoing is ok now.  encouraged, even.
[21:17] techwraith: isaacs: agreed
[21:17] isaacs: techwraith: you can do inheritance with prototypes.
[21:17] softdrink: you can use your own oop solution or something off the shelf, like mootools
[21:17] dnyy has joined the channel
[21:17] marlun: isaacs: I've installed node with homebrew but I don't think I've installed npm with it.
[21:17] techwraith: isaacs: At the expense of encapsulation
[21:17] isaacs: marlun: maybe you have a .npmrc file?  that /usr/local/share/npm is all homebrwe
[21:17] jonaslund: inheritance is really not an issue with a dynamic language like JS
[21:18] dnyy1 has joined the channel
[21:18] isaacs: i use inheritance a lot
[21:18] isaacs: not in npm, which is very low-level and mostly functional, but in other applications
[21:18] tjholowaychuk: i wish the objects themselves were the protos
[21:18] tjholowaychuk: no .prototype
[21:18] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: you can do that with the ES5 stuff.
[21:18] isaacs: Object.create() and friends
[21:18] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: yeah totally
[21:18] isaacs: constructors are nice, though.  so is instanceof
[21:19] isaacs: though Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) provides similar utility
[21:19] tjholowaychuk: instanceof
[21:19] tjholowaychuk: sucks
[21:19] tjholowaychuk: haha
[21:19] marlun: isaacs: Can't find a .npmrc file, should that be in my home directory?
[21:19] tjholowaychuk: i know what you mean though
[21:19] isaacs: marlun: yeah, it would be.
[21:19] mpoz2 has joined the channel
[21:19] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: stylus was a good example of crazy breakage for npm
[21:19] tjholowaychuk: I had nib use the AST nodes from stylus
[21:19] techwraith: I would call js object based, not object oriented :P
[21:20] tjholowaychuk: for some stylus functions
[21:20] marlun: isaacs: Well, I removed it :)
[21:20] techwraith: but it's really just sematics
[21:20] tjholowaychuk: but it ALL breaks due to instanceof
[21:20] tjholowaychuk: since npm gives you different objects
[21:20] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: well, yeah, if you're delving into the guts of another package, sure, that'll be problematic in some case.
[21:21] isaacs: that's the "inappropriate intimacy" smell.
[21:21] tjholowaychuk: definitey ways around it
[21:21] dnyy2 has joined the channel
[21:21] tjholowaychuk: but it renders a lot of core js stuff useless
[21:21] isaacs: most innuendoful term in all of CS 
[21:21] tjholowaychuk: which is why i dont like instanceof
[21:21] isaacs: duck-typing is usually safer
[21:21] tjholowaychuk: without .prototype an object should just have methods that "super" to figure out type
[21:21] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[21:21] tjholowaychuk: exactly
[21:22] isaacs: the issue with OOP in JS is that it's way too fluid.
[21:22] isaacs: it doesn't force you into a rigid Interface -> Class -> Instance heirarchy
[21:22] tjholowaychuk: i think it sits in an awkward middle-ground
[21:22] isaacs: (like some other languages that start with J)
[21:23] dunpeal: isaacs, jonaslund, tjholowaychuk: my point is that plain functions are just not as convenient as classes. since node.js is built on a language that has so many high-level features, why does it limit its API to something that looks like the best you can do with C?
[21:23] techwraith: 'An very illustrate example: In chapter 6 of "Object-Oriented JavaScript" describe 10 manners to implement "inheritance". How many manners there are in Java? One, and in C++? One, and in Delphi (Object Pascal)? One, and in Objective-C? One.'
[21:23] isaacs: dunpeal: node exposes a low-level API.  it also exposes some classes on top of that.
[21:24] techwraith: I actually think this is an advantage for js
[21:24] isaacs: dunpeal: if you want to do low-level file system operations, and control every stat call, then you need the lowlevel functional model.
[21:24] isaacs: dunpeal: of *course* that's going to be "bigger" in terms of the "size" of the API, because it's more granular.
[21:24] dunpeal: isaacs: right, but who said a "low-level API" needs to look like C?  Smalltalk and Ruby have low-level APIs that still take full-advantage of their high-level features (e.g. File) etc
[21:25] frodenius has joined the channel
[21:25] isaacs: dunpeal: looking like C is not viewed as a bad thing.
[21:25] isaacs: i would argue that, in some ways, the lowlevel JS api in node is sparse and beautiful
[21:25] isaacs: it's relatively low-magic, but takes away a lot of the pain of doing async fs io in c
[21:26] softdrink: js styles are so varied anyway… i like that node doesn't force you into a specific way of doing classes and such
[21:26] dunpeal: isaacs: if I wanted to write C, I'd use... C :)
[21:26] dunpeal: isaacs: as for your valid arguments: I'm not entirely sure using classes would hurt performance. but if it does, why doesn't node.js (as its supposed to be a platform) provide higher level stdlib with those classes?
[21:26] davidascher has joined the channel
[21:26] jonaslund: errrr
[21:26] jonaslund: my JS certainly doesn't look like C
[21:26] isaacs: dunpeal: it.. um... it does?
[21:26] jonaslund: simply because C lacks so much conventient stuff
[21:26] isaacs: dunpeal: that's what fs.ReadStream and fs.WriteStream are
[21:27] isaacs: and Buffers and Stream#pipe()
[21:27] dunpeal: isaacs: right. but that's very little.
[21:27] isaacs: there's actually a lot of pretty high-level OOP stuff
[21:27] softdrink: oddly enough, js has made me a better c programmer hehe
[21:27] isaacs: what can't you do with it?
[21:27] SubStack: node also doesn't force you use to use particular callback scheme like promises or deferred
[21:27] SubStack: (anymore)
[21:27] isaacs: SubStack: well, it does force you to use callbacks, but that's highly wrappabel
[21:28] isaacs: dunpeal: Design the API you'd like.  Then pick a name for it.  Then put a package.json in the root of your project.  Then publish it with npm
[21:28] dunpeal: isaacs: sure, but it would be nicer if batteries were included.
[21:28] SubStack: just start saying that npm IS the stdlib
[21:28] isaacs: dunpeal: nicer for whom?
[21:28] isaacs: dunpeal: yeah ^
[21:29] isaacs: npm IS the stdlib
[21:29] dunpeal: well, nicer for me and my subjective opinions :)
[21:29] isaacs: npm's registry, to be more precise
[21:29] jonaslund: dunpeal: I've used alot of C, a fair bit of C++, too much Java and now recently using JS more and more.. and looking at how productive i've been noticing that every time i've been doing excessive "oop" i've spent more time designing than doing shit
[21:29] dunpeal: isaacs: OK, so what's the standard OOP File lib everyone is using?
[21:29] TheFuzzball has joined the channel
[21:29] jonaslund: dunpeal: My java code looks like i should be using JS

[21:30] dunpeal: usually, yeah.
[21:30] veezy has joined the channel
[21:30] jonaslund: dunpeal: classes might be convenient when you've done them right... but most of the time a few functions does 90% of the work
[21:30] isaacs: dunpeal: you can do most things you really need using the stream api.  in npm, i wrap require("fs") to handle EMFILE errors, and a few other tiny things.
[21:30] isaacs: dunpeal: but mostly, i think people use the lowlevel api when they need something more granular than Streams.
[21:30] taf2: https://github.com/taf2/fork.node/blob/master/test/server.js <= pretty cool now it will respawn dead workers
[21:31] dunpeal: jonaslund: it's just a bit more convenient. if I have File, I don't have to keep track and pass around a file descriptor.
[21:31] taf2: and it seems to load balance nicely over multiple workers... but i'm still verifying that
[21:31] reid has joined the channel

[21:31] dunpeal: jonaslund: no argument that OOP gets overused and abused, like most other tools. but it does provide some nice features.

[21:32] isaacs: dunpeal: what do you need to do that is tricky in the current api?  (honest question, maybe it could be better)
[21:32] taf2: konobi, ^^
[21:32] dunpeal: jonaslund: I used to do a lot of C and C++ without real usage of classes. Since then, I've been spoiled by really nice OOP languages like Python, Ruby, and well, JS.
[21:32] konobi: taf2: yeah
[21:32] taf2: cool
[21:33] dunpeal: isaacs: nothing special; I just expect to be able to do: var f = File('/foo.txt'); f.read(5)
[21:33] tjholowaychuk: dunpeal: classes are lame :p
[21:33] konobi: taf2: ah... i missed that on first look over
[21:33] tjholowaychuk: dunpeal: and that would not work well
[21:33] softdrink: i always end up doing struct hacks to do oop-like stuff in c
[21:33] tjholowaychuk: async :p
[21:33] dunpeal: instead of `fd = fs.open('/foo.txt'); fs.read(fd, 5)
[21:33] isaacs: dunpeal: check out the various promises stuff.  npm search promise

[21:34] dunpeal: isaacs: OK, thanks.
[21:34] taf2: konobi, yeah... there seem to be some issues when forking... after the first fork on darwin process.title works but on a second fork it raises the best exception every
[21:34] dunpeal has left the channel
[21:34] isaacs: dunpeal: those basically flip the thing around.  so instead of passing a continuation function that gets called when the thing is done, you get a promise object that gets "resolved"

[21:39] tjholowaychuk: wrong port maybe?
[21:39] isaacs: kkaefer: npm can (maybe) tell you the repo url.  npm view <pkg> repository.url

[21:39] stisti: veezy: I ran it with ./configure --prefix=$HOME && make && make install

[22:06] xeodox: tjholowaychuk: Is it bad if I do it in ejs? (I'm used to html...)
[22:06] asdfsafdsa: mmm jade
[22:06] moshe has joined the channel
[22:06] coreb: jade is haml but as tjholowaychuk says, looking better
[22:06] tjholowaychuk: xeodox: not at all
[22:06] tjholowaychuk: that's what options are for
[22:07] asdfsafdsa: jade + stylus + coffeescript = sexy
[22:07] xeodox: tjholowaychuk: ok good. I'm going to stick with ejs then. It's more traditional.
[22:07] brownies has joined the channel
[22:07] coreb: with ejs it's easy to adapt existing html into a template
[22:07] xeodox: tjholowaychuk: for ejs, is it possible to "include" html from another file? 
[22:07] boghog: inside a module (but outside any function), what does 'this' refer to?
[22:08] tjholowaychuk: xeodox: with express you would use partial()
[22:08] tjholowaychuk: to render another template and output the results
[22:08] stagas: ejs can pretty fast become unreadable
[22:08] tjholowaychuk: <%- partial('user', user) %>
[22:08] tjholowaychuk: etc
[22:08] tjholowaychuk: stagas: yeah I agree
[22:08] tjholowaychuk: I used it on one large-ish template
[22:08] tjholowaychuk: and it was brutal
[22:08] tjholowaychuk: but
[22:08] tjholowaychuk: if you keep most the logic to helpers it should be ok
[22:09] tjholowaychuk: iteration is the worst part since forEach is pretty ugly
[22:09] coreb: would be nice with an html to jade converter, and back
[22:09] tjholowaychuk: coreb: there is one
[22:09] tjholowaychuk: https://github.com/donpark/html2jade
[22:09] tjholowaychuk: I haven't tried it

[22:16] tjholowaychuk: as well
[22:17] tjholowaychuk: but for example - if (foo) in jade takes the block following it and wraps it in a closure
[22:17] pHcF has joined the channel

[22:19] AntelopeSalad: tj, what are the odds of you properly incorporating mustache.js into express?
[22:20] techwraith: AntelopeSalad: donpark has a handlebars plugin for express
[22:20] techwraith: it's basically mustache with some other cool stuff built in
[22:21] coreb: tjholowaychuk: I see, but it's possible to use both jade and ejs in the same express project right, it's just that with the default template engine you don't need to add the file extension
[22:21] AntelopeSalad: techwraith: thanks, checking it out now
[22:22] tjholowaychuk: AntelopeSalad: none of them are incorporated.. anything that chooses to support express will work :p
[22:22] tjholowaychuk: coreb: correct
[22:22] tjholowaychuk: page view can be jade, layout can be ejs etc
[22:22] tjholowaychuk: doesnt matter
[22:22] coreb: partial could be either too?
[22:22] tjholowaychuk: yup
[22:23] coreb: that's nice, flexible
[22:23] tjholowaychuk: express just uses the parent view's extension as a guess unless explicitly set
[22:23] bingomanatee: pyrotechnick: chown!
[22:23] Bwen has joined the channel
[22:23] AntelopeSalad: this definitely looks a lot more clean than the 'stache' implementation of mustache.js
[22:23] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[22:23] tjholowaychuk: AntelopeSalad: I started one a while ago
[22:23] techwraith: :)
[22:23] tjholowaychuk: not done yet
[22:23] tjholowaychuk: you can optimize mustache pretty well
[22:23] tjholowaychuk: but its still not much faster than ejs/jade really
[22:24] tjholowaychuk: IMO not enough to make it worth using
[22:24] AntelopeSalad: i have nothing against jade, i just want to write regular html and not bother with logic in the template
[22:24] tjholowaychuk: for sure
[22:24] tjholowaychuk: i have mixed feelings about mustache
[22:24] tjholowaychuk: i like it in some ways
[22:24] bingomanatee: stizz: are you coming to the node.js meetup in SF?
[22:25] tjholowaychuk: but in some ways i want bits of logic in my template, that are related to the display
[22:25] tjholowaychuk: not in my controller or some "setup" object
[22:25] stizz: when is the meetup?
[22:25] TomY has joined the channel
[22:25] bingomanatee: 6:30
[22:26] AntelopeSalad: i think you did a good job with jade though, it's not overly difficult to see what's going on for the most part from the perspective of someone who converts PSDs to html, they can probably figure out what's going on
[22:27] brianloveswords has joined the channel
[22:27] tjholowaychuk: i wish there was a better textmate/vim syntax available
[22:27] tjholowaychuk: to lazy to work on one
[22:27] AntelopeSalad: that is another issue too, but in the grand scheme of things it's not really super important
[22:28] stizz: where is the meetup at?
[22:28] AntelopeSalad: someone will make one eventually :D

[22:33] coreb: tjholowaychuk: I think you're right about logic in the template
[22:33] tjholowaychuk: coreb: it should be readable still
[22:33] tjholowaychuk: but I think it belongs there really
[22:33] tjholowaychuk: I guess it also depends if you have designers working on them or not
[22:34] coreb: just because a lot of noobs misuse it, doesn't mean people who know what they're doing shouldn't be able to foreach collections, and do ifs
[22:34] tjholowaychuk: I just dont really like prepping an object just to pass to the template
[22:34] tjholowaychuk: when I could just pass the object
[22:35] coreb: the complexity's just somewhere else
[22:35] AntelopeSalad: you can still pass an object and display its properties however you see fit with mustache
[22:35] tjholowaychuk: yeah exactly
[22:35] coreb: it's a design issue
[22:36] coreb: I just do foreaches and ifs in my templates, really, and that's readable
[22:36] coreb: I do no logic there
[22:36] AntelopeSalad: example, check this out - https://github.com/janl/mustache.js
[22:36] AntelopeSalad: then look at the "Dereferencing Section" section of the readme
[22:37] AntelopeSalad: that's pretty straight forward and painless for both the developer and the designer
[22:37] tjholowaychuk: AntelopeSalad: yeah, still not flexible in some cases though
[22:37] tjholowaychuk: well a lot
[22:38] xSmurf: http.createClient is gone? I've been out of the loop too long :/
[22:38] dandean: AntelopeSalad: This might make mustache work a little better for you from within Express: https://github.com/dandean/mustachio/
[22:39] dandean: It adds the idea of View Helper objects which live next to your mustache views.
[22:39] coreb: you could do jade and have no logic at all in your templates, why use a template engine that enforces it
[22:39] no-gooder has joined the channel
[22:39] tjholowaychuk: "myview.mustache.js"
[22:39] tjholowaychuk: thats the reason I dont like mustache
[22:39] tjholowaychuk: haha
[22:39] rauchg has joined the channel
[22:40] tjholowaychuk: you have these objects that are ONLY useful for templates
[22:40] tjholowaychuk: doesnt really make much sense
[22:40] dandean: tjholowaychuck: it's exactly what I'm looking for. I can't stand how messy templates get when logic is in there.
[22:40] tjholowaychuk: dandean: yeah
[22:40] tjholowaychuk: pros/cons
[22:40] tjholowaychuk: I like that it would look cleaner
[22:40] dandean: makes tons of sense for the way I like to work, but I can see both sides, for sure.
[22:40] tjholowaychuk: but I dont like having more areas influence the template
[22:41] coreb: logic should be in the controller
[22:41] coreb: or at least handled there
[22:41] dandean: coreb: depends...
[22:41] no-gooder: hey guys
[22:41] no-gooder:  is there any serialization library that i  can use with node.js which supports circular referencing ?
[22:41] sechrist: big.handlebar.mustache.js
[22:42] tjholowaychuk: dandean / coreb: maybe express should have an optional event when rendering
[22:42] AntelopeSalad: dandean: i've been using https://github.com/fat/stache but tj said it's pretty dirty
[22:42] tjholowaychuk: to prepare objects
[22:42] tjholowaychuk: but still do res.render() like normal
[22:42] tjholowaychuk: but say iterate items and assign classes so you just do foo(class=item.class)
[22:42] no-gooder: sechrist, was that to me?
[22:43] sechrist: lol no, just playing off of tj's comment
[22:43] _fat has joined the channel
[22:44] dandean: tjholowaychuck: I'm not too clear on how that would work.
[22:44] coreb: an optional event, but still do rendering as normal?
[22:44] tjholowaychuk: dandean: yeah not sure haha just brainstorming
[22:44] willwhite has joined the channel
[22:44] tjholowaychuk: it wouldn't be to nice, again you would be prepping the object somewhere other than the template
[22:44] tjholowaychuk: kinda lame
[22:44] dandean: AntelopeSalad: I haven't used fat's stache module, but he seems like a smart guy. 
[22:44] sechrist: tj have you encountered anything that can't be represented in jade from the original html?
[22:45] sleeplessinc_: Is there any way that the callback for an http server in node, could be invoked twice on the same transaction?
[22:45] tjholowaychuk: sechrist probably
[22:45] sechrist: hm
[22:45] mscdex: sleeplessinc_: favicon.ico
[22:45] tjholowaychuk: sechrist: cant think of anything right now
[22:45] coreb: how does one do doctype and similar? //doctype ...?
[22:45] tjholowaychuk: there are some limitations
[22:45] tjholowaychuk: like foo(foo:bar: baz) would need 'foo:bar' for the namespace
[22:45] sleeplessinc_: twice on the same CONNECTION (socket connect) ?
[22:45] dandean: tjjolowaychuck: but not in the controller, right? The event would fire, and some other observing function would fire with the data as the argument?
[22:46] kawaz_air has joined the channel
[22:46] tjholowaychuk: dandean: yeah
[22:46] mscdex: sleeplessinc_: possibly, check request.url
[22:46] tjholowaychuk: with the view name etc
[22:46] dandean: interesting. but where would that live?
[22:46] tjholowaychuk: good question
[22:46] tjholowaychuk: anywhere really
[22:46] dandean: for me, it's nice that that stuff lives right next to the view it's associated with.
[22:46] tjholowaychuk: since express is not really structure bound
[22:47] dandean: I suppose you could just pass in a function, and devs could maintain their own helper objects with related functions.
[22:47] dandean: nah, I still like myview.mustache.js !
[22:48] coreb: dandean: have a blast ;)
[22:48] dandean: coreb: lighting the fuse.
[22:48] coreb: it's important to have options
[22:48] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[22:49] tjholowaychuk: they all have limitations
[22:49] dandean: indeed
[22:49] tjholowaychuk: I think liquid is a nice middle ground
[22:49] coreb: yeah, and it's based on what we personally like, not what's right
[22:49] tjholowaychuk: but I still dont like typing html
[22:49] dandean: gah, I fucking hate liquid

[22:50] dandean: I've just had a few excruciating shopify experiences.
[22:50] tjholowaychuk: and restrictive enough that you can optimize it well
[22:51] coreb: shouldn't be hard for designers to learn jade though
[22:51] coreb: they don't do logic, and they don't need to
[22:51] tjholowaychuk: dunno
[22:51] tjholowaychuk: from what i've seen designers barely touch templates
[22:52] tjholowaychuk: all our "designers" code
[22:52] tjholowaychuk: haha
[22:52] tjholowaychuk: we dont have a designer
[22:52] tjholowaychuk: they give us some pictures
[22:52] tjholowaychuk: and thats it
[22:52] coreb: yeah, that's typical
[22:52] coreb: they don't want to learn html and css
[22:52] dandean: The amount of code you have to write in liquid to do rather simple logic or data modification is just staggering. If they provided a view helper class it'd be way easier to use.
[22:52] coreb: I dislike especially css work, so that's frustrating
[22:53] tjholowaychuk: all the programmers on our team do css/html
[22:53] coreb: they'd give you a picture, you'd have to implement it in grief, then they'd complain about pixels being off
[22:53] _fat has joined the channel

[22:58] no-gooder: mscdex, keep going then :)
[22:58] no-gooder: dandean,   circular referencing

[23:32] sechrist: all 9 don't have that
[23:33] malkomalko: I don't buy the jade argument
[23:33] tjholowaychuk: jade argument?
[23:33] sechrist: mine?
[23:33] malkomalko: all of jade can be boiled down into like a 10 line tutorial
[23:33] tjholowaychuk: oh
[23:33] sechrist: it's converting old code that's bitten me
[23:33] tjholowaychuk: yeah it's pretty basic
[23:33] sechrist: if there was a two-way thing
[23:34] sechrist: hell yes
[23:34] tjholowaychuk: try that html2jade thing
[23:34] malkomalko: so you have a lot of html that you want converted to jade?
[23:34] sechrist: well I mean just for weird cases like learning syntax
[23:34] sechrist: if I have some html that I can't figure out how to escape properly
[23:34] sechrist: I'd like to run it through a tool
[23:34] sechrist: and get the proper solution
[23:34] tjholowaychuk: = escapes
[23:34] tjholowaychuk: != doesnt
[23:34] tjholowaychuk: thats all you need to know really
[23:34] industrial: nodejs being the webserver part itself, I can't print application errors to the screen like with apache + php?
[23:35] paolodedios has joined the channel
[23:35] tjholowaychuk: my docs are kinda shitty though
[23:35] malkomalko: yah jade is very basic
[23:35] malkomalko: I've been using it for a long time
[23:35] javaanse_jongens has joined the channel
[23:35] malkomalko: and it has only bitten me a few times
[23:35] tjholowaychuk: attrs
[23:35] sechrist: tjholowaychuk: what's the purpose of the conditonals.js example you have?
[23:35] tjholowaychuk: were the bitch
[23:35] sechrist: that made me think that conditions weren't a part of the language
[23:35] sechrist: but they are
[23:35] sechrist: so idk
[23:35] tjholowaychuk: sechrist: you can implement your own jade compiler "subclass" to make first-class conditionals etc
[23:35] malkomalko: just to show you how you can create your own filters
[23:36] tjholowaychuk: if foo instead of - if (foo)
[23:36] coreb has joined the channel
[23:36] tjholowaychuk: we use a subclass for translation etc
[23:36] malkomalko: I'd say that's really the only advanced thing
[23:36] tjholowaychuk: yeah the AST stuff is kinda confusing
[23:36] Nexxy: ACTION requests an official definition of the term, "retard css"
[23:36] tjholowaychuk: Nexxy: hehe :D
[23:36] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: I'd like to make it pluggable too
[23:36] tjholowaychuk: instead of inheritance based
[23:36] sechrist: also the vim and textmate plugins i've tried using are far from perfect
[23:36] malkomalko: how about body{padding: 5px}input{foo:'bar'}
[23:36] tjholowaychuk: jade.use(conditionals) etc
[23:36] sechrist: I should probably look to see if I can fix the bugs
[23:37] JJMalina has joined the channel
[23:37] sechrist: but one bug is so glaringly obvious i'm sure there's a reason it's not working
[23:37] tjholowaychuk: sechrist: yeah they are not amazing
[23:37] Nexxy: also since jade is being discussed
[23:37] Nexxy: iz best option for templating?
[23:37] tjholowaychuk: sechrist: the biggest beef for me is that - js stuff here is not parsed as js
[23:37] tjholowaychuk: for TextMate at least
[23:37] Nexxy: I know I've asked it before but I just want to make sure
[23:37] tjholowaychuk: there is no "best"
[23:37] sechrist: Nexxy: there isn't a best
[23:37] sechrist: that's the problem
[23:37] malkomalko: yah that'd be nice for the jade stuff, but I don't think it's bad as it is
[23:37] Nexxy: most widely used/most likely to be able to have questions answered?
[23:38] Nexxy: compared to mustache or something
[23:38] malkomalko: if you are going to get your hands wet and manipulate an AST, you probably know that shit anyway
[23:38] Nexxy: omg language
[23:38] malkomalko: do you mean js client side templating?
[23:39] Nexxy: ya
[23:39] malkomalko: check out this page
[23:39] malkomalko: body{padding: 5px}input{foo:'bar'}
[23:39] malkomalko: ERRR: http://jsperf.com/dom-vs-innerhtml-based-templating/143
[23:42] AntelopeSalad: the jade test wouldn't even run in opera for some reason
[23:42] tjholowaychuk: the link is busted
[23:42] tjholowaychuk: (for jade's js)
[23:42] malkomalko: I'm a big fan of doU and doT
[23:43] malkomalko: been using that lately.. score very fast, and is all I really need
[23:43] isaacs: are you guys talking about WoW in here or something?
[23:43] malkomalko: uber nerd alert
[23:43] isaacs: wow.
[23:43] malkomalko: dot :P
[23:44] isaacs: adn here i thought node.js was already as nerdy as it gets
[23:44] malkomalko: I'm sad that I remember that
[23:44] halfhalo: ACTION walks away slowly
[23:46] isaacs: i am so psyched for nodeconf
[23:46] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko: did you check the branch?
[23:46] malkomalko: haven't gotten a chance to, leaving work now
[23:46] malkomalko: gonna pull it down and check it on the train ride home
[23:46] tjholowaychuk: sounds good

[23:47] xeodox: In Express, how do I always send a variable down to the template? I don't want to include it in the res.render every freaking time. Otherwise I would have to copy and paste it 10 times!
[23:47] xeodox: oops underline?
[23:47] mart_ has left the channel
[23:48] malkomalko: you could use a middle ware to set the local programmatically 
[23:48] malkomalko: res.local()
[23:48] tjholowaychuk: xeodox: is it something you can apply at the app level?
[23:48] tjholowaychuk: is it static data?
[23:48] tjholowaychuk: app.locals()
[23:48] tjholowaychuk: or res.local[s]()
[23:48] xeodox: what's app.locals? How do I set that?
[23:48] tjholowaychuk: or passing to the template
[23:48] Tobsn: hmm does anyone know if i can access redis or mongodb directly from the command line?
[23:48] Tobsn: without any drivers etc.
[23:48] tjholowaychuk: xeodox: local variables
[23:48] tjholowaychuk: like the others
[23:48] xeodox: Tobsn: mongo -uusername -ppassword database
[23:48] tjholowaychuk: but you can apply them all the time
[23:48] malkomalko: Tobsn: mongo
[23:49] Tobsn: eval right?`
[23:49] xeodox: Tobsn: But you gotta start mongod first
[23:49] Tobsn: well yeah of course
[23:49] malkomalko: alright.. gonna check out that branch
[23:49] malkomalko: be back later
[23:49] Tobsn: nice... i think i can have a bash script that stuffs logs into mongodb ;)
[23:50] bwinton` has joined the channel
[23:50] xeodox: tjholowaychuk: can you show me how to do it in an example in pastebin?
[23:50] tjholowaychuk: xeodox: it's in the docs
[23:50] tjholowaychuk: http://expressjs.com/guide.html#app.helpers()
[23:50] tjholowaychuk: just havent updated
[23:50] tjholowaychuk: with the locals() name
[23:50] tjholowaychuk: same thing
[23:51] tjholowaychuk: bad example
[23:51] tjholowaychuk: haha
[23:51] xeodox: tjholoway: yes, i understand you can set res.locals( blah, blah)....but I don't want to copy and paste that to every Controller function
[23:51] tjholowaychuk: i should update that
[23:51] chrislorenz has joined the channel
[23:52] willwhite has joined the channel
[23:52] xeodox: tjholowaychuk: update what?
[23:53] tjholowaychuk: use middleware then
[23:53] tjholowaychuk: or some helper function
[23:53] tjholowaychuk: anything within the req/res cycle can assign the locals
[23:53] tjholowaychuk: but it's up to you to decide where

[23:55] xeodox: thanks guys, got it.
