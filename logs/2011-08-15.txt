[01:47] AvianFlu: AnthonyBullard: Node.js uses UNIX versioning: odd-numbered releases are unstable

[01:48] AnthonyBullard: AvianFlu:  Awesome to know.  Have other devs reported issues with basic stuff like the http module?
[01:48] AvianFlu: well they're bringing in functionality bit by bit through the 0.5.x series

[02:12] Nuck: Like I said, it tastes just like CSS

[02:48] Nuck: No nesting
[02:48] Nuck: chilts: might as well use a JSON file then :P

[02:49] Nuck: lol true
[02:49] chilts: I've done processing with one line per doc before, so that I don't have to read in the entire file

[03:40] kmiyashiro: right
[03:40] Nuck: Not what I want
[03:41] Nuck: I want to be an oAuth 2 provider
[03:41] kmiyashiro: oh
[03:41] Nuck: yeah lol
[03:41] kmiyashiro: why would you want that
[03:41] Nuck: I've got an API
[03:41] Nuck: And some requrie people to be logged in
[03:41] kmiyashiro: ic
[03:41] Nuck: But would be useful for things to build on our platform
[03:41] kmiyashiro: yeah
[03:41] Nuck: Like mobile apps, desktop apps, etc.
[03:41] kmiyashiro: sure
[03:41] kmiyashiro: go with oauth2 then
[03:42] kmiyashiro: problem with oauth2 is that not many libs for it
[03:42] Nuck: Yeah, but I'm not sure if I should do a side-by-side of drafts 10 and 15
[03:42] kmiyashiro: and people basically disregard the spec
[03:42] Nuck: Or just do 15 and such?
[03:42] Nuck: Well, there's 20 drafts to pick from
[03:42] kmiyashiro: do your own flavor or copy a bigger implementation
[03:42] Nuck: So it's hard to stick to the spec already, not to mention how long it is
[03:43] vikstrous: random question: what's with people putting the comma in variable declarations at the beginning of new lines?
[03:43] kmiyashiro: it's not that long
[03:43] chjj: its e-mazing
[03:43] Nuck: It's long enough that people will go tl;dr
[03:43] chjj: thats why
[03:43] kmiyashiro: you just need to focus on the flows
[03:43] chjj: @vikstrous
[03:43] kmiyashiro: just pick one
[03:43] kmiyashiro: flow
[03:43] chjj: vikstrous, what do you mean though?
[03:43] vikstrous: like this:
[03:43] chjj: does it offend you?
[03:44] kmiyashiro: and before you take my advice, I've never implemented it
[03:44] vikstrous:     var mongoose = require('mongoose')
[03:44] vikstrous:        , Schema = mongoose.Schema
[03:44] vikstrous:        , mongooseAuth = require('mongoose-auth');

[03:44] bripkens has joined the channel
[03:44] chjj: yeah i do that, i used to not do it
[03:44] Nuck: kmiyashiro: It's not hard to implement I'd imagine, not with Express :P
[03:44] chjj: until i realized i do everything that way except for commas
[03:44] kmiyashiro: I've just designed an OAuth2 setup thing for API providers
[03:44] chjj: for example, concatenation i do: 'str'\n+'str'
[03:44] chjj: plus sign is always after the new line
[03:45] vikstrous: well why not just do var on every line if you want it to be clear?
[03:45] chjj: so i started being more consistent by putting commas there too
[03:45] Nuck: vikstrous: Because it isn't clear?
[03:45] Nuck: Well it is
[03:45] chjj: eh, dont like the look, all those vars look cluttered
[03:45] Nuck: But this is no less so?
[03:45] temp02 has joined the channel
[03:46] vikstrous: Heh, I guess it's all a matter of opinion.
[03:46] csanz_ has joined the channel
[03:46] Nuck: only thing I have against the comma-at-the-start is that it borks the auto-indenting logic on my text editor
[03:46] chjj: i used to not like the comma-first style, but i was slowly seduced by it
[03:46] Nuck: chjj: Same
[03:46] vikstrous: I'm not hating on the style, I'm just wondering what the arguments for it are.
[03:46] Nuck: I think it's an acquired taste.
[03:46] zilch has joined the channel
[03:46] kmiyashiro: yeah, I don't use pre-comma because of indents
[03:46] kmiyashiro: easier to delete lines though
[03:46] chjj: its more pleasing to my eye, rather than comma at the end, i dont know if theres any particular advantage, its also more consistent with my style
[03:47] AvianFlu: I put my commas at the end because that's how regular english works, but there's nothing wrong with leading commas
[03:47] chjj: i dont see why there has to be an advantage in order to want to use it
[03:47] kmiyashiro: you can delete lines
[03:47] AvianFlu: the parser and lexer certainly don't mind them
[03:47] kmiyashiro: wait
[03:47] kmiyashiro: actually I don't know
[03:47] AvianFlu: I think it's just aesthetic preference
[03:47] AvianFlu: like semicolons
[03:47] kmiyashiro: yeah
[03:48] kmiyashiro: and for the var thing
[03:48] chjj: i also happen to think aesthetics might be my most important reason for writing anything the way i do
[03:48] kmiyashiro: at least on frontend code
[03:48] AvianFlu: although to be fair, there are one or two weird edge cases where you need semicolons
[03:48] kmiyashiro: if you do var a, b, c, it minifies better than var a; var b; var c;
[03:48] chjj: AvianFlu: not necessarily
[03:48] AvianFlu: it's also technically incorrect JS to have more than one var in a function, says crockford
[03:49] chjj: there are ways to avoid using semicolons completely
[03:49] chjj: by using certain unary operators and whatnot
[03:49] AvianFlu: right, but aren't there a couple of places where it matters?
[03:49] kmiyashiro: crockford says to declare each var with a var too
[03:49] chjj: crockford isnt worth listening to
[03:49] chjj: on a lot fo things
[03:49] Nuck: yeah
[03:49] AvianFlu: I hate dropping that name, it always causes fights
[03:50] zilch has joined the channel
[03:50] Nuck: Crockford had some good ideas, but damnit, the man went too far
[03:50] tauren: anyone have experience with pub/sub? Does it make sense to subscribe to multiple events? For instance: subscribe(["eventA","eventB","eventC"], callback)
[03:50] chjj: "dont use regexes" i lol'd
[03:50] AvianFlu: yeah that's silly
[03:50] Nuck: "the good bits" ended up being more of a pain than "the bad bits"
[03:50] tauren: I have a situation where I need to do something after all three events have happened.
[03:51] Nuck: tauren: That would actually be a very cool thing
[03:51] tauren: Or should I just stick with deferreds and their when() functions?
[03:51] tauren: Nuck: it seems useful to me too, but I don't want to reinvent something if it already exists.
[03:52] vikstrous has joined the channel
[03:52] kmiyashiro: tauren: is that time based?

[03:52] kmiyashiro: like, all 3 events occur within 10 min
[03:53] tauren: kmiyashiro: well, in my case it would probably be within fractions of a second. like load three different json resources and do something when they are all loaded.
[03:54] tauren: but it could certainly be longer i suppose...
[03:54] zilch has joined the channel
[03:54] kmiyashiro: hm
[03:54] kmiyashiro: might want to look at async.js or something
[03:54] AvianFlu: async ++
[03:54] AvianFlu: http://github.com/caolan/async
[03:54] tauren: yeah, using it
[03:54] tauren: but i want something on the client too
[03:54] AvianFlu: that lib is dual-sided
[03:55] AvianFlu: if you read the code, it contains a whole bunch of browser compatibility stuff
[03:55] tauren: oh really? i'll check that out. I've been using jquery's deferreds on the client. but pub/sub seems more elegant.
[03:56] AvianFlu: yeah, async ftw
[03:56] tauren: what if this multi pub/sub thing was built with async. and the pub/sub was just a simple interface in front of it.
[03:57] AvianFlu: tauren: you may want to look at hook.io as well - it has browser compatibility too

[03:58] AvianFlu: play with it, decide for yourself
[03:59] AvianFlu: that's often a hard question to answer on a platform that's v0.4.10
[03:59] tauren: sure...
[04:00] tauren: so the consensus is that there are other tools to do what i need, and I shouldn't be inventing some multi-topic pub/sub mechanism.
[04:00] AvianFlu: yeah, pretty much
[04:00] tauren: ok, cool. that's why I asked! ;)
[04:00] AvianFlu: there are services for that, too
[04:00] Nuck: AvianFlu: Hey, it's v0.5.x already :P
[04:00] AvianFlu: like pubnub
[04:01] zilch has joined the channel
[04:01] tauren: cool, thanks!
[04:01] Nuck: So, I think I'm gonna implement oAuth 2.0 on the cutting-edge.
[04:01] Nuck: draft 20
[04:03] Nuck: And then we can stay cutting-edge as time goes on, an just tag whenever we implement a new draft
[04:03] Nuck: Might actually start as low as 15 and work my way up
[04:04] tauren: Nuck -- I posted some links to an oauth2 project on SO. Might be useful to look at it: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6822840/is-there-a-node-oauth-server-implementation

[04:49] teadict: can node be used in serious production with concurrent situations (specifaclly messaging)?
[04:49] teadict: will I encounter serious problems if I embrace myself into using node for this next client?
[04:49] teadict: common question if they exist.. I know
[04:50] tylergillies_: is there a ||= equiv in javascript?
[04:52] teadict: I know it *can* be used, I know of use cases... 
[04:54] zilch has joined the channel
[04:54] teadict: I think the question that I really need to ask and get a answer for is if one can build, without major problems, a full concurrent web application like one would do in Ruby for instance; can the classic server languages be replaced for real?
[04:55] chjj: i think so, but the "node as a side-dish philosophy seems very present unfortunately"
[04:55] KingJamool has joined the channel
[04:56] teadict: side-dish?
[04:56] chjj: yes
[04:56] chjj: a lot of people take node as a side-dish
[04:56] teadict: you mean I should use it to solve the problems that node is best at solving and keep using Ruby for eaxmple for the main application parts?
[04:56] chjj: have their main site written in php or something awful
[04:56] teadict: I see
[04:56] teadict: but...
[04:56] chjj: and then use node for what they need it
[04:57] zilch has joined the channel
[04:57] teadict: isn't there already enough well wrtten stable tools for developing web apps?
[04:57] teadict: backbone, etc
[04:57] teadict: would you say it is still a risk?
[04:57] chjj: i believe backbone is for the client side specifically
[04:57] chjj: i think its slightly coupled with jquery isnt it?
[04:57] teadict: oh sorry, I don't have them mapped yet heh
[04:57] teadict: let's mark it as irrevelant
[04:58] teadict: if I can create concurrent http servers..
[04:58] teadict: and do correct messaging for a COMET like app..
[04:58] teadict: and then hook up a MVC lib
[04:58] chjj: i think node is well suited to handle everything for the most part
[04:58] teadict: and use YUI maybe on the client side...
[04:59] teadict: have you used it in real production?
[04:59] teadict: YOU, not use cases
[04:59] teadict: *YOU, not use cases that you know of

[05:00] tylergillies_: how is v8 vm compared to java?
[05:00] teadict: chjj: have you done concurrency with it?
[05:00] teadict: chjj: it's my main concern
[05:00] tylergillies_: concurrency would b easy
[05:00] chjj: i dont think im popular enough to test something like that in production otherwise i would
[05:00] tylergillies_: just spawn a new process

[05:20] teadict: tylergillies_: that's it, you answered my concerns
[05:21] teadict: if it can be used for that easily, then fuck it, it's on
[05:21] teadict: is the code on github or something? I'd LOVE to take a look at it
[05:22] teadict: the whole app actually.. since I'm still learnning node O:)
[05:22] tylergillies_: nope sorry
[05:22] tylergillies_: its an internal tool owned by the company i work for
[05:22] teadict: np ^_^
[05:22] teadict: can you describe the tools though?
[05:23] teadict: did you do MVC with node and that kind of things
[05:23] tylergillies_: no
[05:23] tylergillies_: i usually don't do MVC with node
[05:23] teadict: so what's the dynamics?
[05:23] teadict: you're not serving HTML then?
[05:23] tylergillies_: im serving html....
[05:23] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[05:24] teadict: did you use a lib for that on the server?
[05:24] tylergillies_: express
[05:24] teadict: oh...
[05:24] teadict: but isn't it MVC oriented?
[05:25] tylergillies_: loosely
[05:25] tylergillies_: theres no model or controllers
[05:25] tylergillies_: theres views though
[05:25] teadict: I see..
[05:25] teadict: oh, that.. where do databases fall in all these?
[05:26] teadict: I can't use NoSQL
[05:26] tylergillies_: Models are the scehma that make up the database
[05:26] teadict: and I of course need a server database
[05:26] teadict: what lib connects to MySQL?
[05:26] teadict: or whatever
[05:26] tylergillies_: http://search.npmjs.org
[05:26] KingJamool has joined the channel
[05:26] tylergillies_: you can search for node modules
[05:27] tylergillies_: just type in mysql
[05:27] bripkens has joined the channel
[05:27] ritch has joined the channel
[05:28] teadict: ah, it's no big deal
[05:28] teadict: damm this is matture
[05:28] teadict: screw it, I'm doing it in node
[05:29] teadict: I'll invent excuses, I don't care
[05:29] teadict: there's no way I'll write PHP having this available
[05:29] teadict: plus PHP doesn't even do real concurrency
[05:29] teadict: I can use that as excuse..
[05:29] tylergillies_: are you looking for concurrency or parallelism?
[05:30] teadict: concurrency for comet
[05:30] teadict: that's all
[05:30] teadict: why you ask?
[05:31] tylergillies_: just curious
[05:31] teadict: it's about a common model of application
[05:31] teadict: there's tasks distributed in various sectors of this company..
[05:31] teadict: one task completition leads to the next
[05:32] teadict: in that process, messages and warnnings are handled and the following task supervisor needs to knows stuff from the previous task
[05:32] teadict: in real time of course
[05:32] teadict: so he can begin his/her tasks
[05:32] teadict: that's basically it
[05:33] teadict: a normal COMET structure will suffice, right?
[05:33] teadict: tylergillies_: it's one server, 50 clients, btw
[05:34] tylergillies_: yeah should be fine
[05:35] teadict: great
[05:35] tylergillies_: node scales really well
[05:35] teadict: plus, writting the server side concurrency will be a bliss in node
[05:35] teadict: I don't think it'll take 5k lines of code
[05:35] teadict: it's what it was made for
[05:35] SubStack: that is an awful lot of lines
[05:35] tylergillies_: was just thinking that
[05:36] teadict: SubStack: heh, I went too far
[05:36] tylergillies_: i try to keep my code under 300
[05:36] SubStack: under 300 is a good amount
[05:36] SubStack: spin off the hairy stuff into modules
[05:36] tylergillies_: like mother fucking chainsaw
[05:36] tylergillies_: :)
[05:36] teadict: hairy?
[05:36] tylergillies_: hairy == lots of code
[05:36] teadict: ach so
[05:37] SubStack: the difficult bits
[05:37] SubStack: that make your application ugly
[05:37] teadict: okey.. let's google for some code examples of COMET then..
[05:37] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[05:37] tylergillies_: the difficult bits are rather enjoyable, its the verbose bits that bother me
[05:38] tylergillies_: comet is just a term
[05:38] tylergillies_: its a pun on ajax
[05:38] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[05:38] zilch has joined the channel
[05:38] tylergillies_: because comet is essentially inverted ajax
[05:39] teadict: yes, I know... but still, it's the correct word to use to describe the app model
[05:39] tylergillies_: anything that utilizes "push" is comet
[05:39] teadict: *structure
[05:39] teadict: https://gist.github.com/291145 that's it?
[05:39] teadict: that would be the core of my app?
[05:39] teadict: this is going to be fun
[05:40] teadict: well, make it a good lib of course.. and so on
[05:40] teadict: but great

[07:12] vdemedes: help me create a name for Rails-like Node.js framework
[07:12] margle: vdemedes: YARLF
[07:13] vdemedes: margle: ?
[07:13] margle: vdemedes: "yet-another-rails-like-framework"
[07:13] margle: vdemedes: :P
[07:13] vdemedes: heh, nice
[07:14] vdemedes: margle: I thought about "Sambucca" :-D
[07:14] margle: vdemedes: nice, where you from?
[07:15] vdemedes: margle: Ukraine
[07:15] vdemedes: Framework is written in Coffee Script
[07:15] vdemedes: (it is not ready yet)
[07:15] zilch has joined the channel
[07:16] vdemedes: I've already implemented auto coffee script compiling(controllers, models, helpers, etc), routing, configs, controllers
[07:17] vdemedes: and I've got one very nice feature: once you edited and saved (for example) controller, framework compiles it and replaces current version of the file with the new one
[07:17] brokenjames: so much code
[07:17] vdemedes: brokenjames: sarcasm?
[07:17] vdemedes: brokenjames: if yes, I had to start with something
[07:17] brokenjames: no not at all
[07:17] vdemedes: brokenjames: connect really helps me
[07:18] pizthewiz has joined the channel
[07:18] vdemedes: its middleware rocks
[07:18] zilch has joined the channel
[07:18] ronnieboy has joined the channel
[07:18] brokenjames: I think node frameworks are a bit odd
[07:19] margle: agreed
[07:19] vdemedes: brokenjames: why? because they are sinatra-like?
[07:19] vdemedes: single-file apps?
[07:19] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[07:20] jbpros has joined the channel
[07:20] arpunk has joined the channel
[07:21] brokenjames: I just have an odd view on what you do with Node
[07:21] vdemedes: http://pastie.org/2374133
[07:21] vdemedes: here is how routes declaration works in my framework
[07:21] vdemedes: brokenjames: you can do with Node.js everything you did with other frameworks
[07:21] hellp has joined the channel
[07:22] brokenjames: that is very true
[07:22] brokenjames: I am not sure what a node framework would do better
[07:23] vdemedes: brokenjames: the result is 10x faster apps
[07:23] vdemedes: brokenjames: also, the huge benefit is that you can use JS at both server and client sides
[07:23] margle: brokenjames, vdemedes: alot of the framework are "X-like"
[07:24] vdemedes: margle: you mean "Express-like"?
[07:24] margle: would like to see something that's a departure from the norms
[07:24] vdemedes: or what
[07:24] zilch has joined the channel
[07:24] vdemedes: margle: so, you think creating Rails-like framework for Node.js has no sense/advantage/benefit?
[07:25] brokenjames: I would never say that
[07:25] margle: vdemedes: I certainly think it has merits, but it just feels wrong.
[07:25] brokenjames: you would gain everything you learned from writing it
[07:25] vdemedes: why?
[07:25] vdemedes: I think that's what Node.js misses
[07:25] vdemedes: full-packaged framework with powerful tools
[07:26] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[07:26] margle: vdemedes: perhaps, because you get something that's rails like, but not full featured.
[07:26] margle: vdemedes: and you're thinking... "this is like rails but without all the glue."
[07:26] SubStack: frameworks are bad
[07:26] SubStack: libraries are good
[07:26] vdemedes: I saw tens of questions: "What's better: Node.js or Ruby + Rails"
[07:26] brokenjames: I feel much better using Node to blur the line between computers
[07:27] vdemedes: and I always answered:
[07:27] vdemedes: that if you want fast, productive coding, choose Rails
[07:27] margle: SubStack: but then you're writing the glue?
[07:27] vdemedes: if  you want amazingly fast app but with slower productivity, choose Node.js
[07:27] margle: I suppose you are anyway.
[07:27] SubStack: good libraries don't need much glue
[07:27] brokenjames: and when you start thinking hey these 30 computers are one computer and share one memory space and have 30 sets of  human input
[07:27] SubStack: also glue quickly turns into more libraries
[07:27] rurufufuss has joined the channel
[07:28] vdemedes: With the framework I'm creating, I want to enable Node.js developers work more productively and still produce high-speed apps
[07:28] zilch has joined the channel
[07:28] SubStack: vdemedes: that's like saying "I want my thing to be good and I want it not to suck"
[07:28] SubStack: obviously
[07:28] vdemedes: SubStack: no
[07:28] vdemedes: SubStack: I'm just working on something(I think) good

[07:35] SubStack: don't do that

[07:36] vdemedes: they're terrible, mine will be good
[07:36] vdemedes: :-D
[07:36] vdemedes: Geddy?
[07:36] SubStack: try an approach that hasn't been tried before
[07:36] SubStack: there are plenty of rails and sinatra clones, no use making more
[07:36] vdemedes: on Node.js?
[07:36] SubStack: yes
[07:37] vdemedes: can you give a link?
[07:37] vdemedes: skip Geddy
[07:37] paulwe has joined the channel
[07:37] vdemedes: and I don't need sinatra clones
[07:37] vdemedes: I want Rails clones

[07:39] Nuck: It has its quirks
[07:39] zilch has joined the channel
[07:39] Nuck: But there's really no need for Rails.
[07:39] SubStack: or if you like rails you can just go use rails
[07:39] SubStack: easy to do
[07:39] Nuck: Very true.
[07:40] Nuck: I hear it's very easy to make a rails-style app on rails.
[07:40] vdemedes: Nuck: I know Node.js on pretty good level
[07:40] vdemedes: Nuck: I've created web app on Node.js
[07:41] Nuck: That's not really "pretty good level" that's... about average?
[07:41] vdemedes: Nuck: and I love it.

[07:42] industrial: I'd love MVC and an ORM for Node, yeah
[07:42] vdemedes: industrial: +1
[07:42] Nuck: Fuck ORMs
[07:42] Nuck: Just use MONGO.
[07:42] industrial: express*
[07:42] Nuck: Or COUCH
[07:42] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[07:42] SubStack: fuck MVC, fuck ORM
[07:42] SubStack: fuck frameworks
[07:42] industrial: I use an ORM for mongo, actually
[07:42] Nuck: I agree with SubStack.
[07:42] industrial: (mongoose)
[07:42] thalll has joined the channel
[07:42] Nuck: industrial: ...
[07:42] vdemedes: SubStack: You are writing apps without frameworks?
[07:42] industrial: WHAT
[07:43] Nuck: MONGO IS NOT RELATIONAL :|
[07:43] zilch has joined the channel
[07:43] vdemedes: Mongoose is awesome
[07:43] Nuck: >:C WHY DO PEOPLE CALL MONGOOSE AN ORM WHEN IT IS NOT
[07:43] vdemedes: and it really speeds up development
[07:43] fireiris has left the channel
[07:43] Nuck: vdemedes: It slows me down
[07:43] vdemedes: I agree with industrial, I love Mongoose
[07:43] vdemedes: Nuck: how?
[07:43] Nuck: If it speeds you up, you're too slow.
[07:43] industrial: so much anger this morning
[07:43] SubStack: vdemedes: yes you just write programs like any other program
[07:44] markwubben has joined the channel
[07:44] Nuck: vdemedes: It's heavy as fuck.
[07:44] industrial: blah blah opinions :\ really throw more FUD over the fence
[07:44] vdemedes: Nuck: you'd better write those 10 lines with node-mongodb-native driver instead of 1 with Mongoose?
[07:44] SubStack: web development with frameworks like rails is this strange outler
[07:44] SubStack: you can't just have some var state = {}
[07:44] Nuck: It's like carrying around a goddamn whale on my code.
[07:44] vdemedes: OH MY GOD
[07:44] SubStack: you've got to jump through a ton of hoops to do anything
[07:44] vdemedes: SubStack: for example? And what do you mean by "var state = {}"
[07:44] Nuck: vdemedes: And Mongoose defeats the entire purpose of using Mongo to begin with.
[07:44] vdemedes: You can't declare variable with frameworks?
[07:44] vdemedes: Nuck: no, it is just a tool
[07:44] Nuck: Mongo is a giant fucking Queryable array of JSON objects
[07:44] SubStack: vdemedes: in rails you can't just have some persistent state like that
[07:45] zilch has joined the channel
[07:45] vdemedes: Nuck: it is wrapper for "low-level" Mongo drivers like node-mongodb-native
[07:45] industrial: and im queriying it STRUCTUREDly
[07:45] vdemedes: Nuck: BSON, not JSON
[07:45] SubStack: you've got to shoehorn your problem into the MVC mold
[07:45] vdemedes: SubStack: It is my English level or I don't understand you
[07:45] SubStack: whether it's appropriate or not
[07:45] Nuck: vdemedes: There's no need to make the distinction outside of storage
[07:45] Nuck: BSON is just more queryable
[07:45] industrial: SubStack: well then the framework isnt appropriate for your problems
[07:46] vdemedes: what's so bad about structuring application into controllers, models and views?
[07:46] vdemedes: and have everything in "right" places?
[07:46] Nuck: vdemedes: Because it squashes adaptation
[07:46] vdemedes: Nuck: adaptation to what?
[07:46] SubStack: vdemedes: because rails knows best where those "right" places are
[07:46] SubStack: even if they aren't
[07:46] vdemedes: SubStack: Yes, Rails knows best
[07:47] vdemedes: and why not to follow it?
[07:47] Nuck: When I code I don't want to worry about what's a model, what's a view, and what's a controller
[07:47] SubStack: if you really care about putting things in the right places you should have the freedom to say "fuck you" to what rails thinks
[07:47] vdemedes: and not waste time?
[07:47] industrial: SubStack: its called convention over configuration
[07:47] Nuck: Hell, I never studied MVC.
[07:47] bripkens has joined the channel
[07:47] industrial: Nuck: studying design patterns will do you good
[07:47] edgarallanpoe has joined the channel
[07:47] Nuck: I just follow the rule of /what looks best is best/
[07:47] SubStack: industrial: I'm aware and I don't care for it
[07:47] vdemedes: SubStack: You can say "fuck you" to Rails and go with Sinatra
[07:47] vdemedes: (if you are on Ruby)
[07:47] SubStack: industrial: I disagree. Design patterns are a horrible hole to get sucked down.
[07:47] vdemedes: Nuck: no no no mate
[07:47] vdemedes: what looks best for you can look awful for someone else
[07:48] Nuck: If it works, and if it's well-built, who gives a fuck if it's structured the way people like it today
[07:48] vdemedes: what looks best for you is not always correct
[07:48] vdemedes: oh my
[07:48] zilch has joined the channel
[07:48] industrial: SubStack: with express we have functions not controllers handling URL's. there's really no difference in the end wether its a class with  methods or a function yielding other methods
[07:48] Nuck: vdemedes: I'll tell you what I told my cofounder.  jsbeautifer.org and make it however the fuck you want.
[07:48] SubStack: vdemedes: there is no "correct" way to write a web app
[07:48] SubStack: there are lots of ways
[07:48] vdemedes: SubStack: agree
[07:48] Nuck: SubStack: There's just the few ways that are named
[07:48] vdemedes: and you need to pick one
[07:49] Nuck: Like MVC
[07:49] industrial: but im backing away from this conversation, its not all that intelligent to bicker over things like this
[07:49] Nuck: My way?  Follow a rule of logic.
[07:49] SubStack: Nuck: yep naming things gives them undue weight in design decisions
[07:49] vdemedes: Nuck: your logic can't be right always
[07:49] SubStack: that is why I hate design patterns so much
[07:49] Nuck: vdemedes: There is no right
[07:49] Nuck: There is only what you guys call right.
[07:49] vdemedes: Oh damn

[07:49] SubStack: just because something has a name doesn't make it a good idea
[07:49] damiano: hello
[07:49] Nuck: MVC looks like shit to me
[07:49] vdemedes: I'm just wasting time here
[07:49] skm has joined the channel
[07:50] vdemedes: see you soon
[07:50] Nuck: I mean, my code loosely fits into the general concept of those three parts
[07:50] damiano: I have to create an image with few letters/numbers inside (captcha)
[07:50] Nuck: But I didn't really bother to arrange it that way
[07:50] damiano: is there a simple library to create it ?
[07:50] Nuck: damiano: Just use reCAPTCHA.
[07:50] industrial: damiano: ^
[07:50] damiano: Nuck i don't link it
[07:50] Ezku\: wow, what
[07:50] Ezku\: 's with all the bashing :o
[07:51] SubStack: Nuck: it's pretty nice if those patterns emerge on their own instead of being dictated from the outset
[07:51] Nuck: It's always OCR-hard, so it's generally gonna be hard to crack
[07:51] Drakonite has joined the channel
[07:51] damiano: it uses google service if i'm not wrong
[07:51] Nuck: SubStack: I agree.  I believe in organic growth.
[07:51] damiano: i would like to create an image on the fly
[07:51] SubStack: and incrementalism!
[07:51] Nuck: Let the program change how it's gonna change
[07:51] SubStack: tiny libraries are awesome for building stuff incrementally
[07:51] Nuck: Yeah
[07:52] SubStack: you can test your assumptions continuously
[07:52] Nuck: SubStack: We need a name for this development pattern :P
[07:52] Nuck: Add some weight to it
[07:52] Ezku\: node is way too immature an environment for there to already exist a good best practice for structuring ~everything, but that doesn't mean you should choose to adamantly ignore MVC as a concept
[07:52] Nuck: Ezku\: It's not as young as people make it out to be :/

[07:53] brokenjames: hug

[07:53] Nuck: It may be young in years, but as far as usage goes, it's pretty well-proven.
[07:53] brokenjames: for that coding style
[07:53] Nuck: brokenjames: Of what?
[07:53] jamonkko has left the channel
[07:54] Ezku\: Nuck: but architectures and best practices tend to take time. I know node works and believe it's pretty solid, but that's not the issue.
[07:55] brokenjames: frameworks
[07:55] Nuck: Ezku\: I guess that's a valid point, but I really don't see what people mean by "architectures"
[07:55] Nuck: Because honestly, I don't follow much of a pattern.
[07:55] Nuck: I focus less on the planning and more on the coding.
[07:55] SubStack: Nuck: here are some: incrementalism, module-driven development
[07:55] Ezku\: frameworks and concrete implementations of MVC are just reflections of what is considered best practice
[07:55] SubStack: yeah planning is for chumps
[07:56] Nuck: I plan what I'm gonna do next
[07:56] SubStack: Ezku\: exactly, it's prescriptivism
[07:56] Nuck: I contemplate ways to approach things
[07:56] SubStack: fuck everything about prescriptivism
[07:56] Nuck: But I don't think in-depth until I'm actually writing code
[07:56] Nuck: I've never diagrammed

[07:57] Nuck: I generally just sit down and write code.
[07:57] Ezku\: SubStack: I think I understand your viewpoint, but there's no need to be so harsh about it. Once you figure out what the best way to organize your stuff is, wouldn't you want to reuse your work? If you do, that's a framework right there.
[07:57] brokenjames: hmmm
[07:57] Nuck: Ezku\: That's not a framework.
[07:57] SubStack: it could be a framework
[07:57] SubStack: but there are better ways to achieve reuse
[07:57] SubStack: namely libraries
[07:57] Nuck: You're just slapping a name on something to categorize it
[07:58] hybsch has left the channel
[07:58] Nuck: My reuse comes from Nod'es wonderful module system
[07:58] Ezku\: yeah, well, programming is in significant parts about semantics, categorization and generalization.
[07:58] Nuck: require('../user-login-handler.js')(database);
[07:58] Nuck: I do shit like that
[07:59] vdemedes has left the channel
[07:59] SubStack: Ezku\: I think deeming things "best practice" is a bad idea

[07:59] whitman has joined the channel
[07:59] Nuck: There are just different practices.

[08:01] random123: SubStack: Why would co-routines slow Node.js or hog memory?
[08:01] Nuck: I see it as a box of tools.  I can build a fence using a box of nails and a hammer or a box of screws and a screwdriver.  They each have their positives and negatives.
[08:01] damiano: no idea?
[08:01] brokenjames: I am very comfortable with stealing a locked up hammer
[08:01] SubStack: random123: I have no idea. I don't use them because I don't want to incur the mental penalty of having to reason about them.

[08:02] Nuck: SubStack: Oh man, I wish you could see the recursive code I wrote.

[08:03] SubStack: I can handle recursion well enough, it's the stateful shit that trips me up
[08:03] jamonkko has left the channel
[08:03] Nuck: SubStack: I had to write a recursive function which resolved a one-to-many relationship down into a single array

[08:03] Nuck: But there were two relationshops per item
[08:03] Nuck: Err, two sets
[08:04] SubStack: gist it!
[08:04] Ezku\: using a hammer for nails instead of screws is a best practice. This shit isn't that complex, really.
[08:04] Nuck: Can't, corporate code ;)
[08:04] SubStack: I thought it was your startup?
[08:04] SubStack: you can do whatever the fuck
[08:04] Nuck: Ezku\: Aye, but what if I have 12 different types of nails.  Now you've got a ton of choices
[08:04] Nuck: SubStack: fair enough :P
[08:05] Nuck: I'll edit out the super-secret parts :P
[08:06] brokenjames: ++--++--
[08:06] SubStack: Nuck: so you had to write a catamorphism then?
[08:06] SubStack: a fold
[08:07] SubStack: or it's called reduce in javascript
[08:07] Nuck: No idea

[08:08] Nuck: Still doesn't check for infinite recursion
[08:09] Nuck: I wrote a quick fake-mongo-native layer
[08:09] Nuck: So I could run it in a client
[08:09] SubStack: neat, asynchronous dependency resolution
[08:09] Nuck: essentially
[08:09] SubStack: cycles you mean?
[08:10] Nuck: cycles?
[08:10] SubStack: those are easy to check for, just annotate the nodes
[08:10] Nuck: annotate the nodes?
[08:10] Nuck: Are you speaking English?
[08:10] SubStack: var visited = {}; ... if (visited[node]) { ... } visited[node] = true
[08:11] SubStack: standard cyclic detection tactic
[08:11] Nuck: Yeah I know
[08:11] Nuck: The fun is passing it down the layers
[08:11] Nuck: And ensuring I don't run into issues between the two chains

[08:19] damiano: guys, how to create image WITHOUT Using online service?
[08:19] Nuck: damiano: Image generation?
[08:19] Nuck: node-canvas?
[08:19] damiano: Nuck, i have to create on the fly image
[08:19] damiano: to send it to browser
[08:19] damiano: png or jpeg
[08:20] damiano: i have to create this small image with few letters/numbers inside (max 5-6)
[08:20] Nuck: damiano: node-canvas is an implementation of the Canvas tag from HTML5.  There's also imagemagick and such other hooks
[08:20] Nuck: I'd suggest imagemagick for that on a captcha, I assume
[08:20] Nuck: it's pretty battle-tested for distortion.
[08:20] zilch has joined the channel
[08:21] Nuck: I still stand by it that reCAPTCHA is a better choice, though.
[08:21] damiano: https://github.com/rsms/node-imagemagick
[08:21] damiano: ?
[08:21] Nuck: damiano: That should work.
[08:21] Nuck: Imagemagick is a powerful program.
[08:21] Nuck: It's just a wrapper for that I assume
[08:21] damiano: ok
[08:21] damiano: i try it

[08:26] damiano: hmmm the doc is very poor :/
[08:27] Nuck: damiano: Writing your own captcha has a lot of problems.  First, there's the problem of balancing readability with security.  Then, there's the problem of actually distorting it accurately
[08:28] Nuck: or inaccurately, as the case may be :P
[08:28] damiano: Nuck, is not a problem...i'm talking about a very small website...
[08:28] damiano: so i increment the security + 1 :-)
[08:28] damiano: to block lamer
[08:29] damiano: i don't think a program can read the text inside an image, no?
[08:29] damiano: btw is not a problem for the moment
[08:29] Nuck: They can
[08:29] damiano: maybe i can put a formula
[08:29] damiano: :D
[08:29] damiano: like
[08:29] Nuck: Have you never heard of OCR?
[08:29] damiano: 1+1 + log(10)
[08:29] damiano: :D
[08:29] damiano: ahahahah
[08:30] Nuck: ReCAPTCHA is gaurunteed hard-to-read simply because it's the things that their state-of-the-art OCR programs couldn't read
[08:30] Nuck: damiano: Oh, I've seen FAR worse.
[08:30] damiano: Nuck, maybe i can put a formula...
[08:30] SamuraiJack has joined the channel
[08:30] damiano: OCR doest resolve it
[08:31] xerox: you could make a canvas with a word all blurred and swirled and hacked
[08:31] Nuck: damiano: Honestly, if you just want to stop lightweights, anything is gonna do the job
[08:31] xerox: that when you hover on it with the mouse, it unbars unswirls and unhacks a tiny part
[08:31] Nuck: Most won't bother to fire up OCR or anything unless you've got something awesome.
[08:31] damiano: xerox, that traslate for new node.js developer...could means? :)
[08:31] Nuck: xerox: Problem is, that means you transmit the word to the client

[08:34] Nuck: damiano: Don't think too hard about how stupid and/or lazy most pepople are.
[08:34] damiano: Nuck, yes, you are right
[08:35] damiano: but Nuck, if i load a number (text) with socket.io

[08:36] markwubben has joined the channel
[08:36] Nuck: Raynos: Everything is a callback.
[08:36] Raynos: I.e. do some async setup of a database or some other async computation before you want the server to start
[08:36] damiano: kmiyashiro, what do you think about socket.io system? (for captcha)
[08:36] Raynos: Most of the boot time setup is doing in blocking require calls
[08:36] kmiyashiro: umm, not sure how that would work
[08:37] damiano: kmiyashiro, load the form, then send with socket.io a text (like: ABCDEF)
[08:37] xerox: Raynos: I do this: bin/app with #!/usr/bin/env node as first line, in which I require('../lib/app') 
[08:37] damiano: that is the code of the captcha
[08:37] Nuck: Raynos: I export a function, which I can then call and pass a callback.
[08:37] xerox: Raynos: in that js script I do the initialization, and in the lib/app the rest
[08:37] kmiyashiro: ok
[08:38] kmiyashiro: but you're still sending to the client?
[08:38] damiano: hmm yes
[08:38] kmiyashiro: not sure if bots listen on sockets yet lol
[08:38] damiano: :)
[08:38] kmiyashiro: but
[08:38] damiano: kmiyashiro, so...what solution do you prefer? :-D
[08:38] ptlo: damiano: the fact that it's not written in the page/response body doesn't mean it can't be intercepted
[08:39] blup has joined the channel
[08:39] kmiyashiro: captcha is kind of a bad solution... I prefer my kitten idea
[08:39] Raynos: Let's say I have a set of models that are loaded by app. And each model does some database communication before the server can start. 
[08:39] ptlo: damiano: in the browser (eg. js debugging), not on the wire
[08:39] kmiyashiro: there are other types of image based tests
[08:39] Raynos: The only method I can think of is having each model emit a ready event and listening on all of those
[08:39] Raynos: It just feels like there should be a de facto standard way of handling this common problem
[08:40] damiano: ptlo, so
[08:40] damiano: what can i do?

[10:35] damiano: and inside this object some function
[10:35] Fabryz: what to do?
[10:36] damiano: how can i return 't' object ?
[10:36] kulor-uk has joined the channel
[10:36] damiano: because if i use this inside a function it doenst return the "main" object

[10:38] damiano: yes
[10:38] zilch has joined the channel

[11:06] xerox: Fabryz: exactly
[11:07] xerox: you can just use == anyway
[11:07] jorenl_: people could just hack my client js code, and send some random events to make my server crash :/

[12:48] Fabryz: you make it test to someone else
[12:48] Fabryz: what are you making?
[12:49] jorenl_: something about listning to music together
[12:49] jorenl_: a bit like turntable.fm (but different)
[12:49] kwk: I'm trying to pull a simple JSON structure from my nodejs server and parse it with http://docs.sencha.com/ext-js/4-0/#/api/Ext.Ajax  . When I deliver the nodejs server output statically through an apache it works but when I just use response.end() with no HTTP header information, the Ext.Ajax.request method fails. Does anybody know how to prepare data the is sent from NodeJS so that it can be interpreted by ExtJS?
[12:50] jorenl_: But I've been testing it a lot with others, the problem is that if someone decides to mess with the client JS, he can crash the server with some 'trying to set property x of undefined' error

[12:54] Fabryz: you must do it
[12:54] jorenl_: or maybe try/catch?
[12:54] Fabryz: ya
[12:54] jorenl_: and then kick the client in the catch. might be the easiest

[13:11] fotoflo_: hmm, doing a little reading about Node. It's not a web server, but it becomes a web server in a few lines of code right?
[13:11] Fabryz: yes
[13:12] Fabryz: it's javascript server side, asynch, event driven, working under linux + V8 engine
[13:12] Fabryz: you can write an HTTP server in few lines 
[13:12] fotoflo_: are there fully featured servers out there?
[13:12] davidbanham: przemoc: emailjs looks good. node_mailer works fine, it just feels clunky setting up all the auth info in the send call rather than earlier in the code in a configure call. No biggie, though.
[13:13] matbee has joined the channel
[13:13] jetienne: fotoflo_: this is more to write servers, as in webapp, than cloning apache

[13:13] fotoflo_: ?
[13:13] jetienne: fotoflo_: see it like ruby for rails
[13:13] davidbanham: fotoflo_: http://expressjs.com/ is a popular framework, built on top of http://tjholowaychuk.com/post/664516126/connect-middleware-for-nodejs
[13:13] shiawuen has joined the channel

[13:15] fotoflo_: python and django are server side languages
[13:15] fotoflo_: is is ruby
[13:15] zilch has joined the channel

[13:17] fotoflo_: right, we use nginx at my work
[13:17] fotoflo_: and java for our backend 
[13:17] jetienne: fotoflo_: so forward nginx to node, like you would for, say, rails + mongrel
[13:18] fotoflo_: so the users request goes to nginx, it passes the request to a node.js file which interprets the request and spits back output?

[13:26] davidbanham: fotoflo_: I've followed a pretty similar path, recently. I've found node has fit that use case pretty well. It allows you to move pretty seamlessly between the server and the browser.
[13:27] zilch has joined the channel
[13:27] fotoflo_: does node have good ways of accessing a database?
[13:28] jetienne: yes with sql and without
[13:28] TheJH: fotoflo_, yes, for mysql and some nosql databases
[13:28] przemoc: fotoflo_: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules#wiki-database
[13:28] fotoflo_: thx
[13:28] davidbanham: The first webapp I built with it was a user control panel for our product, that was a single-page-webapp that pulled all its data from a nodeJS API server (which incidentally also serves all the static files). The next thing I built was a more traditional website that does all it's processing serverside, throws it in a templating language and all the browser sees is static html. Very similar code on both, just in 
[13:28] davidbanham: different places.
[13:29] davidbanham: For database drivers, https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql has been good to me.
[13:29] fotoflo_: davidbanham: if you wanted to save server load you could move that stuff to the browser and then realize it was too slow and move it back trivially, right?
[13:30] c4milo has joined the channel
[13:30] navaru: hey, is there any more beautiful way to write this? http://jsfiddle.net/navaru/de75L/2/  ... instead of the ternary operator, something that will work with the bitwise operator?
[13:30] ceej has joined the channel
[13:31] davidbanham: fotoflo_: Maybe not trivially. There are a few different challenges in each location. It would certainly be easier than moving back and forth between, say, a php server and a client-side webapp.
[13:31] zilch has joined the channel
[13:31] hlindset has joined the channel
[13:32] davidbanham: fotoflo_: When I was building the control panel, though, there were lots and lots of little wins like my password strength checking function is exactly the same on client side as it is on server side. That way my users get instant feedback without a http round trip, but I still check it serverside before it goes in the database.

[15:56] nickbruun: And a bit of a PostgreSQL anti-pattern?
[15:56] brianc: baudehlo: I feel like that might belong outside the driver since postgres doesn't actually support the '?' character.  I know it's nice to have since mysql uses it, but it probably belongs in a library used to generate sql or something where that can be abstracted away

[17:42] softdrink: that's what i do

[19:41] Postcomputing: Can v8 handle an array with 750,000 members?
[19:41] industrial: Try It And See(tm)
[19:41] Postcomputing: I would be using it for simple key-value lookups, but it's close to a million members
[19:41] AvianFlu: honestly, we'd all like to know, so I think you should try it
[19:41] industrial: Postcomputing: wouldn't you rather use a key/value store for that/
[19:42] zilch has joined the channel
[19:42] bradleymeck: use a key-value store instead, at around 1.4million objects the GC goes bonkers
[19:42] AvianFlu: although be advised that v8 has a hard 1gb heap limit
[19:42] industrial: Like MongoDB

[20:17] TheJH: automatic brace insertion, too!
[20:17] TheJH: woah, that file editor is cool :)
[20:17] industrial: rudolfrck: take a look at the nodejs install wiki
[20:17] Dave-Stein: yeah sorry james, coworker was asking me something
[20:17] industrial: wiki install page*
[20:18] TheJH: and a dif preview... this is awesome
[20:18] TheJH: *diff
[20:18] Dave-Stein: my coworker is saying we shold dispatch events without triggering on the document
[20:18] Dave-Stein: *should
[20:18] Dave-Stein: in normal JS in a browser
[20:18] Dave-Stein: and his answer to me is "node runs on events all the time"
[20:18] rudolfrck: industrial: I'm looking there, but following that will install node.js in $HOME/local/node while npm will install itself in /usr/local/bin by default. Is that really the best way?
[20:19] Dave-Stein: so i know node runs on V8
[20:19] Dave-Stein: but is there like a virtual DOM or anything of that nature?
[20:19] AvianFlu: Dave-Stein: npm install jsdom
[20:19] Dave-Stein: so there is in fact a dom someone can manipulate in node?
[20:20] bnoordhuis: Dave-Stein: someone wrote a dom module
[20:20] AvianFlu: I'm gonna guess and say the github is http://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom
[20:20] TheJH: Dave-Stein, not "there is". you can create one.
[20:20] bnoordhuis: but in general node has nothing to do with the dom
[20:20] Dave-Stein: gotcha
[20:20] Dave-Stein: yeah that's what was throwing me off
[20:20] industrial: rudolfrck: well you dont HAVE to specify a prefix.
[20:20] industrial: just be sure to check out a stable tag (like 0.4.10)
[20:20] Dave-Stein: cause i know in regular JS events map to elements in the DOM but you don't need a DOM in node, although everything is running on events
[20:21] industrial: and it will install in /usr/local
[20:21] Dave-Stein: so the dom module simulates one?
[20:21] bnoordhuis: Dave-Stein: yes
[20:21] TheJH: Dave-Stein, correct. and node.js events don't need a DOM.
[20:21] bnoordhuis: but events in node are generally incoming traffic, disk i/o, etc.
[20:22] Dave-Stein: so if you want to programatically trigger an event you're not using document.createEventObject();
[20:22] newy has joined the channel
[20:22] industrial: rudolfrck: just be sure to sudo make install, because you'll need those rights to place it in /usr/local
