[00:02] TooTallNate: Lingerance: in the REPL, every module has it's own set of the native objects (i.e Array, Function)

[00:03] Lingerance: Ah, lovely.
[00:03] TooTallNate: instanceof is not generally "cross-context safe"

[00:49] albertosheinfeld: When should i use Node.js?
[00:50] MooGoo: sometime next week
[00:50] albertosheinfeld: lol
[00:50] Lingerance: When it's the right rool for the job.
[00:50] Cromulent has joined the channel
[00:50] mandric has joined the channel
[00:50] MooGoo: ok I'll ask here too...
[00:50] albertosheinfeld: yeah but what's an example of that? why don't just use apache or any other server side technology?
[00:50] innociv: When you need something that doesn't always run on a page request.
[00:51] MooGoo: airplane programed in nodejs ? good : great
[00:51] innociv: Apache doesn't do serverside javascript.
[00:51] albertosheinfeld: i know it doesn't but it does php and i can talk with the server using ajax...
[00:52] MooGoo: someone should make a node-autopilot module
[00:52] innociv: But ajax is javascript on the client. nodejs is javascript on the server.  Kind of makes sense to write back and forth with the same language.
[00:52] innociv: And node.js does websockets easy.
[00:52] albertosheinfeld: that's the only plus i see (websockets)
[00:52] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[00:52] albertosheinfeld: cause as far as i know, node just doeesn;t scale
[00:52] innociv: If you have a php app you're already using, use apache and php.  If you are making your own real time application, you should certainly make it with node.
[00:53] innociv: How doesn't it scale?  When apache is using 4-8mb per user, and node a few kb.
[00:53] Nuck|mobile has joined the channel
[00:53] albertosheinfeld: so what will you do when you have a million users doing millions of requests?
[00:53] innociv: The same thing you'd do on apache, run it on multiple processes/servers?
[00:53] MooGoo: sell out to google and retire
[00:53] innociv: Haha yeah that too.
[00:54] gazumps has joined the channel
[00:54] dmkbot1 has joined the channel
[00:54] albertosheinfeld: ok so my question is how do you run multiple node servers as one? behind a load balancer i mean...
[00:54] albertosheinfeld: is it possible already?
[00:54] tmzt: can also try fpm for php or some other fcgi setup
[00:54] innociv: Yes.  They can communicate to each other through a socket iirc.

[00:54] innociv: The video on the node.js page explains this toward the  end.
[00:55] innociv: www.nodejs.org
[00:55] albertosheinfeld: thanks!
[00:55] albertosheinfeld: i will deffinitely check it out
[00:55] albertosheinfeld: so you are telling me that node can scale? this is the first time i hear this... many people have told me it just doesn't
[00:55] innociv: Each process will run independantly, but can communicate with each other, the same way you would scale something like google onto multiple servers even if you're only doing it for multiple threads.
[00:56] albertosheinfeld: and since it also only run on one thread it just cannot compare with other server techs like apache
[00:56] innociv: Lots of websites are using node.js to handle hundreds of thousands of concurrent connections, so I'd think it scales.
[00:56] innociv: Anyway, scale compared to what?
[00:56] Me1000 has joined the channel
[00:56] MooGoo: anything can scale if you throw enough hardware at it
[00:56] innociv: What else does real time data like it does that scales?
[00:56] innociv: You can't compared apache delivering static pages to node.js delivering real time interaction between users...
[00:57] MooGoo: apache is 1 thread per request
[00:57] MooGoo: lots of overhead
[00:57] albertosheinfeld: yeah Moo, but it can cost you X times more
[00:57] albertosheinfeld: to throw 10 servers than to throw 2
[00:57] MooGoo: nodejs "doesnt scale" for the same reason any other new platform doesnt
[00:57] albertosheinfeld: i think 2 apache servers well configured could handle more than 5 node servers (i dont know)
[00:57] innociv: If you don't need node.js, don't use it.  Node.js allows you to develope much richer applications much easier.
[00:57] albertosheinfeld: i want to use it, i loooove javascript
[00:58] MooGoo: it just hasnt been tested as much as apache
[00:58] innociv: If you just need a basic website, don't use it.  And yeah node.js is still young and being improved.
[00:58] jslatts has joined the channel
[00:58] MooGoo: if PHP can scale....node can
[00:58] innociv: Yeah
[00:58] innociv: I don't see how php is going to run better than node.. so much overhead.
[00:59] albertosheinfeld: yeah but multithreaded
[00:59] MooGoo: think of it instead of 1 request per thread, a crap ton of requests per thread
[00:59] albertosheinfeld: why facebook is on php and not in node?
[00:59] MooGoo: facebook php?
[00:59] innociv: facebook is older than node
[00:59] albertosheinfeld: so what?
[00:59] Skyec: facebook actually changed php to run faster
[00:59] albertosheinfeld: exatly
[01:00] albertosheinfeld: you can't do that to javasciprt
[01:00] Lorentz: Facebook is written in PHP, but it's because they have existing source code to work with (why rewrite everything?), and they do crazy stuff with php.
[01:00] albertosheinfeld: or node (for now)
[01:00] MooGoo: yea
[01:00] Lorentz: iirc they compile php to binary with hiphop.
[01:00] MooGoo: its because it works and everyone uses it
[01:00] innociv: php has a lot of nice things, like image editing libraries.
[01:00] Lorentz: I think they actually wrote hiphip.
[01:00] Lorentz: hiphop.
[01:00] MooGoo: heh
[01:00] MooGoo: php has lots of functions
[01:00] innociv: albertosheinfeld, I use php for basic pages.  I have node.js just for real time data.
[01:00] Skyec: this sounds a lot like a "screwdriver is better than a hammer" argument
[01:00] innociv: You can use them together
[01:00] innociv: skyec, yeah exactly.
[01:00] albertosheinfeld: the thing is
[01:01] Skyec: "Screwdriver is better! It screws and unscrews!" etc
[01:01] saikat has joined the channel
[01:01] albertosheinfeld: that i have a website with a lot of concurrent users, i want to start adding websockets to it
[01:01] MooGoo: and it can kinda hammer if you flip it upside down
[01:01] Skyec: work out your requirement, use the right tool/technology. simple
[01:01] innociv: albertosheinfeld, you'll also note this channel has 50% more people than php's when php is 10x older.  Not sure that means anything.
[01:01] albertosheinfeld: but i am afraid to start a new technology without knowing where are the limits, that's why i'm asking
[01:01] MooGoo: well
[01:01] Skyec: ask the right questions, don't try and make generalized comparisons
[01:01] MooGoo: nodejs modules are generally not nearly as mature or plentifuly as PHP and such
[01:02] JaKWaC_ has joined the channel
[01:02] MooGoo: which is a good reason not to use it for the time being
[01:02] innociv: You can do anything with node.js.  The only limit may be effeciency, and I guess we're not sure how to overcome that limit.  node.js does use a lot of cpu(But low memory)
[01:02] MooGoo: does it?
[01:02] innociv: what I hear.  And it makes since, being javascript VM and all
[01:02] innociv: sense*
[01:02] albertosheinfeld: well on real time apps that's waht matters
[01:02] innociv: But on a cheap dedicated server can still handle tens or hundreds of thousands of people
[01:02] MooGoo: PHP/Python/Ruby are all VM's
[01:02] CStumph_ has joined the channel
[01:03] MooGoo: and js has considerbly more resources dedicated to making it fast
[01:03] albertosheinfeld: simple requests you mean?
[01:03] innociv: Aren't google still working on V8 as well and making it faster?
[01:03] CStumph_ has left the channel
[01:03] innociv: Because, yeah, it runs on chrome. Google wants chrome to be fast. Needs a good JS engine.
[01:03] innociv: JS has gotten faster and faster on the browser end the past few years.
[01:03] MooGoo: a single node instance should be able to easily handle thousands of users
[01:03] innociv: I'd say easily tens of thousands.
[01:04] albertosheinfeld: that's nonesense guys.. it depends completely on the request types
[01:04] mikeycgto has joined the channel
[01:04] mikeycgto has joined the channel
[01:04] albertosheinfeld: you can have a heavy data request or a simple message passing request
[01:04] innociv: I have a dual core 2.4ghz opteron. Of course it's only using one core.  My server not even running at 5% cpu to handle a thousand.
[01:04] albertosheinfeld: and that's a completely differnet story
[01:04] innociv: And yes, it depends on how much work the js is doing.
[01:04] Brandon_R has joined the channel
[01:04] Brandon_R: hello guys
[01:04] MooGoo: that would seem to apply to all languages
[01:04] innociv: If you're looping over tens of thousands long arrays every request, yes that's slower, and it's still cpu.
[01:05] Brandon_R: is this for real?
[01:05] Brandon_R: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF3KMqkIXwE
[01:05] innociv: But php has a ton of overhead unless you really chop it up to scale it back.
[01:05] innociv: basic php install is tons of overhead.
[01:05] albertosheinfeld: i agree there
[01:05] aho: v8 is already a lot faster than php, ruby, or python
[01:05] aho: doesnt really matter for most apps though
[01:05] infynyxx has joined the channel
[01:05] MooGoo: not just that...ever request spawns a new thread, loading php and all of its thousands of global functions
[01:05] MooGoo: every time
[01:05] MooGoo: reloading sessions and what not
[01:06] innociv: Yep
[01:06] MooGoo: sessions in nodejs are regular variables
[01:06] albertosheinfeld: well thanks for the info, great discussion, i'll definitely try it out on a simple application to see how it goes
[01:06] Brandon_R: php is too blah for me
[01:06] diamonddog: php is a geat language, but yet incomparable to node performance wise, if you are looking for node like php lib you can try http://phpdaemon.net/
[01:06] MooGoo: is there a mod_node out there?
[01:06] innociv: node.js is one instance, just like the instance on a single browser, that's constnatly running.  You can keep doing a loop in it, regardless of the number of connections to it.
[01:07] Brandon_R: very nice

[01:07] albertosheinfeld: ok
[01:07] innociv: there is a bit of lack of documentation.

[01:09] MooGoo: really fast?
[01:09] Brandon_R: take a look at how many top noch addons there are
[01:09] MooGoo: too fast sometimes
[01:09] innociv: You can use jquery or mootools with it, no?  mootools has a serversidejs package.

[02:00] Oi has joined the channel
[02:00] innociv: Lol, Max.
[02:01] jmoyers: why?
[02:01] jmoyers: dont run node as root
[02:01] jmoyers: bind to a higher numbered port, and use iptables to forward
[02:01] jmoyers: or some such
[02:01] isaacs: i use port 15443 because my name is isaac
[02:01] innociv: Oh
[02:01] isaacs: or 0x15AAC
[02:01] maxogden: lolz
[02:01] TooTallNate: isaacs: that port is too high :p
[02:01] isaacs: 88748?
[02:01] isaacs: nah, it's fine
[02:02] isaacs: just bump up your ephemeral port limit
[02:02] yuwang has joined the channel
[02:02] TooTallNate: haha for sure
[02:02] innociv: That's weird though.  On all the other httpd's you just bind to 80.
[02:02] isaacs: oh, i geuss it is beyond the 2byte limit, huh?
[02:02] jmoyers: there are ways to use a privileged port and then downgrade your permission and such
[02:02] TooTallNate: isaacs: ya there's that ;)
[02:02] jmoyers: i am not super aware of the downsides or upsides innociv, perhaps someone else can comment
[02:03] isaacs: innociv: on the other httpd's, you have to start them as root.
[02:03] jmoyers: but don't they jail them?
[02:03] isaacs: innociv: and then they setuid to some other "http" or "www" user
[02:03] TooTallNate: innociv: there's no technical reason you can't run as root, we're just saying there's better ways
[02:03] jmoyers: like apache's process isn't root
[02:03] jmoyers: its run under a jailed user is it not?
[02:03] isaacs: jmoiron: no, it setuids
[02:03] jmoyers: ah
[02:03] isaacs: jailed user, not a "jail" in the bsd sense

[02:04] konobi: setuid and setgid together at least
[02:05] isaacs: well, on solaris, you could just start hte process as "nobody", adn give "nobody" the right to run on port 80
[02:05] jmoyers: i just use iptables prerouting and be done with it :P
[02:05] saikat has joined the channel
[02:05] tbranyen: heh friend sitting next to me argues that, dropping privs in your code is how you're supposed to do it... so i guess i'm just misinformed

[02:07] jmoyers: is listen synchronous?
[02:08] AvianFlu: jmoyers: I think it takes a callback?

[02:08] kurtzhong has joined the channel
[02:08] abraxas has joined the channel
[02:08] TooTallNate: jmoyers: i think the port binding part (the first part) is synchronous
[02:08] jmoyers: in that case, it out to be liste(80, function(){ process.setuid('nobody') }); i suppose
[02:08] jmoyers: ah, gotcha
[02:08] TooTallNate: then listening on the port is async
[02:08] [diecast]: what is the name of the module or script that allows multiple node versions within a virtual type env
[02:09] jmoyers: innociv well these fine gentlemen are suggesting you run as root and drop priviledges
[02:09] innociv: Drop priviledges?
[02:09] jmoyers: nvm
[02:09] TooTallNate: innociv: setuid(), setgid()
[02:09] jmoyers: change the user to a less privileged user, with setuid
[02:09] chance- has joined the channel
[02:09] jmoyers: so you start as root, but move to somebody who can't destroy your whole shit
[02:10] innociv: So I need to make a new user in debian with the privs to do pretty much nothing but run something on port 80?
[02:10] isaacs: the thing is, you trust YOUR code
[02:10] isaacs: but your code is opening up a door to the outside world, and might have cracks
[02:10] isaacs: so you need to downgrade perms so that an attacker, if he gets in, can't do much
[02:10] jmoyers: innociv if debian has the ability to do that, sure
[02:10] jmoyers: then you don't need to start as root
[02:10] jmoyers: isaacs unless there's a local root exploit ;P
[02:11] jmoyers: then just go home and cry
[02:11] innociv: What do you mean by not start as root?
[02:11] isaacs: jmoyers: sure, but then you can't safely run ANY server as anyone
[02:11] innociv: Like I can't even sudo node file.js.  Says there is no such command as node.
[02:11] jmoyers: we should just shut the internet down imo
[02:11] isaacs: innociv: man sudo; man visudo; man sudoers
[02:12] isaacs: innociv: configure sudo to keep your env consistent

[02:15] [diecast]: was anyone in here at the meetup tonight at pivatol 
[02:15] jmoyers: something like no.de or nodejistu probably abstracts all this business away

[04:15] pyrotechnick: are you trolling?
[04:15] perezd: I'm not trolling...
[04:15] perezd: I saw resizing support in canvas, but not cropping
[04:15] perezd: maxogden: imagemagick is straightforward, I just tend to hate imagemagick in terms of supporting installations of it
[04:16] MooGoo: you can crop all day long with canvas
[04:16] MooGoo: among other things
[04:16] perezd: hmm
[04:16] perezd: well, thanks for the leads! I'll look into it

[05:04] marcello4d: css n00b question: how do you center one div in its parent?
[05:04] marcello4d: margin: 0 auto doesn't seem to be working (chrome 14 or whatever)
[05:04] maxogden: awesome use for the #node.js irc channel but you probably have to set an explicit width on the child div for margin: 0 auto to do anything
[05:05] marcello4d: ah
[05:05] Ned_ has joined the channel
[05:05] marcello4d: no way to just have it use whatever size it has...

[05:05] marcello4d: I guess I can work with that, cheers
[05:05] jmoyers: whatever size it has is 100%
[05:05] marcello4d: I set it to inline block, figured that'd be enough
[05:06] marcello4d: the element inspection shows the rect being the small size, not 100%
[05:06] karboh has joined the channel
[05:06] marcello4d: but an explicit width does do the trick
[05:06] innociv: The parent needs to be display:block and have a fixed width, or all of its parents need to have a % width, for margin: 0 auto; to work
[05:06] monokrome: Does anyone know if there is a middleware or other type of module provided with Stylus which allows you to watch a directory's styles for changes?
[05:07] marcello4d: thanks guys! :)
[05:07] innociv: inline-block might not work on ie6 and ie7
[05:07] monokrome: Essentially, I am trying to have my node development server do `stylus -w`
[05:07] marcello4d: monokrome: not quite the same thing, but I think express will do that for you if you run it in dev mode
[05:07] monokrome: marcello4d: I am using express. Express supports CSS preprocessors?...

[05:12] jmoyers: innociv undoubtedly your iptables
[05:12] maxogden: innociv: ive never used iptables sorry
[05:12] jmoyers: iptables-save and see if you've duplicated the rule, for instance
[05:12] innociv: I don't know what to look at with them. :(
[05:12] jmoyers: you can flush a particular table, also
[05:12] innociv: Oh yeah I ahve to rule in there 3 times.. 
[05:13] jmoyers: thats wrong
[05:13] innociv: I don't want to flush, that removes them all, no?
[05:13] jmoyers: is it in the nat table?

[05:18] innociv: yeah I need the line number.  Not sure how to ge that
[05:18] aeo: It's a function that does no recursion.

[05:18] AvianFlu: aeo: it often means you're doing too much recursion
[05:18] AvianFlu: oh
[05:18] AvianFlu: I mean, what does it do
[05:18] aeo: AvianFlu: I know I'm doing too much recursion. The problem is that Node isn't giving me a stack trace, so I don't know where the too much recursion is happening.
[05:19] aeo: The crash is at line 1 of a JavaScript file.
[05:19] AvianFlu: is this a file you can gist me?

[05:25] aeo: I mean, it does have its own event system, but the events are blocking and inline and all that
[05:25] jmoyers: so actually, presumably its probably a red herring that its even pointing at that file?

[06:44] random123: innociv, OK, well, I didn't get your earlier messages, I just go the part about running node on 80

[06:45] innociv: i think it probably is too... but i'm fialing at it or something
[06:45] innociv: failing*
[06:45] random123: innociv, well on the box Node is running, you should be able to curl localhost and get output on 80
[06:45] random123: innociv, Am I misunderstanding the Q?
[06:46] innociv: I think you are.  Need root to bind on 80
[06:46] jmoyers: innociv http://lists.netfilter.org/pipermail/netfilter/2006-October/067083.html - no examples of using mark, though
[06:46] innociv: "iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -m state --state NEW -d #.#.#.69 --dport 1492 -j ACCEPT", shouldn't it be this?
[06:46] innociv: or should the port be 80?
[06:47] TylerS: Noob question - if I want to install node for all users, would I set the prefix during the configure step of installation to /usr/local/bin ?
[06:47] random123: TylerS, you can set it to /usr
[06:48] TylerS: great, thanks 
[06:48] jmoyers: innociv looks pretty reasonable ;-)

[06:59] innociv: I tried netfilter.  Going to try to simply run node.js on port 80 now
[06:59] jmoyers: port forwarding from 1492 -> 80 not working
[06:59] jmoyers: something in *filter table is screwing the pooch
[06:59] innociv: from 80 to 1492.
[06:59] jmoyers: right right, a little late :P
[06:59] innociv: maybe it's "-A FORWARD -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-port-unreachable"
[07:00] jmoyers: thats why im saying
[07:00] jmoyers: its the FORWARD rule
[07:00] jmoyers: at least when you pasted it, it was the only one

[07:03] fangel has joined the channel
[07:03] innociv: I.. don't know?
[07:04] innociv: I have node.js running on port 1492. if I go to http://ip:1492 that connects.  I want it to work the same if you just go to http://ip
[07:04] zmbmartin has joined the channel
[07:04] ivanfi has joined the channel
[07:05] stagas has joined the channel
[07:05] random123: Well, you are on a Gateway right? That would be the reason to forward, so you must have root on the Gateway to do this
[07:05] Margle has joined the channel
[07:05] dmkbot has joined the channel
[07:05] random123: So you can foward Port 80 on the Gateway to Port 1492 and you would get the desired results
[07:05] jmoyers: fuck it, just sudo node, .listen(80), and .setuid('nobody')
[07:05] jmoyers: go forth
[07:05] innociv: I don't know what the term means, or how to do that.
[07:06] DrMcKay: I'm really a *dumb* person.
[07:06] innociv: when i do "sudo node FILE" i get command not found.
[07:06] jmoyers: absolute path
[07:06] jmoyers: or set up environment
[07:06] innociv: ah right
[07:06] DrMcKay: (util.format on v0.4.11)
[07:07] random123: Are you trying to set up iptables on the same computer than Node is running, because that is not the purpose of forwarding the port
[07:08] innociv: Yes I was.
[07:08] innociv: It's a dedicate server with a few ip's.  I have node running on it.
[07:08] random123: Does that computer have a dedicated IP or is in on DHCP or something in an internal network?
[07:09] jmoyers: what in the fuck are you talking about
[07:09] jmoyers: iptables can definitely forward a port locally
[07:09] jbpros has joined the channel
[07:09] innociv: Has 5 dedicated ips.
[07:09] stagas has joined the channel
[07:10] random123: Why the hell would you get 5 on one computer?

[07:10] Ned_ has joined the channel
[07:10] random123: But why?
[07:10] dmkbot has joined the channel
[07:10] innociv: Because I can only bind one thing to one port on one ip?..
[07:11] random123: You can use nginx
[07:11] random123: And have 1 IP
[07:11] innociv: Then you have to forward on nginx
[07:11] jmoyers: if.. everything you're doing is http
[07:11] innociv: hit that httpd for no reason
[07:11] beevi7: can anyone tell me what "middleware" is in node.js terminology? is it some sort of "plugin" for node?
[07:12] innociv: okay anyway
[07:12] jmoyers: beevi7 if its from express or jsgi, its a way to mutate an http response
[07:12] innociv: bind to port 80, here igo..
[07:12] beevi7: ah i see
[07:12] innociv: so first i need to to like.. sudo -s and create "nobody"?
[07:12] random123: Yes, well, I see no reason to have 5 IPs anyway, you can just map domains to certain services
[07:12] jmoyers: or require certain permissions for a route, or whatever
[07:12] godzirra has joined the channel
[07:13] random123: Instead of IP to certain services
[07:13] random123: That is costly
[07:13] jmoyers: what.. do you think domains map to?
[07:13] jmoyers: everything isn't http
[07:13] jmoyers: you cant use a reverse http proxy for everything
[07:13] beevi7: so if anybody is talking about "middleware" it is always linked to the http module, correct?
[07:13] jmoyers: beevi7 .. maybe?
[07:13] jmoyers: i've heard stream middleware bandied about -- createFilter api
[07:13] jmoyers: not necessarily http
[07:14] random123: I can't think of any type of server where you would need more than 1 IP
[07:14] random123: If you can name one
[07:14] beevi7: so it's "something" that extends any module's functionality?
[07:14] random123: More than 1 IP on a computer*
[07:15] jmoyers: sure -- i have a custom UDP based protocol, and nodes in our network dedicated to mixing audio streams, transceiving audio streams, managing state
[07:15] pyrotechnick has joined the channel
[07:16] innociv: should i have a new group for this user, too?
[07:16] random123: So, based on the domain, which is sent by DNS to the server, you can do different things
[07:16] jro_ has joined the channel
[07:16] vguerra has joined the channel
[07:17] jmoyers: beevi7 its a piece of software that sits between two endpoints and does something to the data moving between
[07:17] random123: just like, if you have one apache server, it can host multiple domains on 80 using virtual host

[07:17] Ned_ has joined the channel
[07:17] dominictarr: hey, does any one know about the status of Stream.pause() on unix pipes?
[07:18] random123: so if they connect to x.com, it will connect to 1.1.1.1 and pass x.com to server, and server does X, y.com and so on
[07:18] jmoyers: random123 yes, you can proxy anything
[07:18] dominictarr: for me it's closing the stdout in the upstream process.
[07:18] jmoyers: but as you move away from standard protocols
[07:18] jmoyers: you have to start writing that software yourself
[07:19] jmoyers: because X-Forwarded-By and shit is http specific
[07:19] beevi7: ok, think i got it. thank you :)
[07:19] jmoyers: so the question is: do i write a custom proxy, or do i add a single ip address?
[07:19] jmoyers: depending on your timeline and shit, you buy the ip address

[08:50] Layke: Hey, so I have a PHP script send somethign to my node server..  I'm just doing $fp = stream_socket_client('tcp://localhost:8124'); and sending a json encoded message.
[08:50] __doc__ has joined the channel
[08:51] Layke: Since I am going to have lots of messages, whic should trigger different events, is it correct to have a "type" property in the JSON?
[08:51] Layke: Or should I be capturing the message via a different method?
[08:51] Lingerance: You might want to look at JSON-RPC
[08:52] Lingerance: Either actually use JSON-RPC, or just read the spec (2.0 preferably) and figgure out what you can use from it.
[08:52] Glenjamin: Layke: i'd say thats up to you as to how you design your protocol, but that in general makes sense
[08:52] Layke: I wanted to keep it as low level as possible.
[08:53] Glenjamin: sending a stream of json messages down a single connection > POSTing JSON over HTTP
[08:53] sylvinus has joined the channel
[08:53] Layke: So, if you had a PHP server needing to communicate with a node.js, you would use curl from the PHP?
[08:53] Lingerance: No
[08:53] fayce has joined the channel
[08:54] Lingerance: I use JSON-RPC over straight TCP, no HTTP
[08:54] Layke: O, I haven't heard of that before.
[08:54] Layke: Can you point me in any direction?
[08:55] Lingerance: It's actually written in a way that suggests it was designed with normal TCP in mind.
[08:55] Lingerance: Hmm?
[08:55] Glenjamin: npm question: how do I set a password for adduser to push on from multiple computers?
[08:56] SubStack: Lingerance: you should check out dnode!
[08:56] SubStack: it's like jsonrpc with callbacks
[08:56] Lingerance: So is my stack.
[08:56] Lingerance: But I have the advantage of a well understood protocol that I can use with other languages.
[08:57] Glenjamin: the JSON-RPC protocol is basically "send json"
[08:57] Layke: Well, I might be thinking of this wrong Lingerance, but I've only ever used JSON-RPC via javascript to my PHP server. Firstly, I would grab all of the available methods by doing reflection of the class on the server, then I would send it to the client, then I would call the method that I need. 
[08:58] Lingerance: I don't know why you're polling it for a list of methods
[08:58] Layke: It could just be a reuirement of dojo.Rpc
[08:58] Layke: That's what I've always been brought up on.

[09:01] pgherveou: hello guys, I am trying to implement my own session store taking connect redis store as an example, I don't see any refresh function that would erase expired session, how is it managed ?
[09:02] Layke: So Lingerance, if I create a json-rpc server on node, I would just create a correctly formed message in PHP like I have been doing currently, and send it via the same tcp socket stream that I have currently?
[09:02] Lingerance: Yes
[09:03] Glenjamin: assuming you make the node server in such a way that it can accept packets in that way
[09:03] amigojapan has joined the channel
[09:03] Layke: Okay thanks. I didn't realise, but now I think about it, my initial question was actually should I use JSON-RPC, except type: "foo" would of mean method: "foo" :) 
[09:03] Layke: Glenjamin, currently I'm running a net server.
[09:04] Layke: net = require('net'); then accepting the stream. But I think I will try and Google JSON-RPC for node.js
[09:04] Glenjamin: how are you delimiting the end of a packet?
[09:04] Layke: Since I don't want to have to manage all the possible responses. 
[09:04] Layke: Glenjamin, I don't, I thought net did that for me by using steam.on('data' ?

[09:06] Lingerance: <Layke> net = require('net'); then accepting the stream. But I think I will try and Google JSON-RPC for node.js <-- most of the current libraries assume you want to do it over HTTP, so you'll need to hack one to get around that.  I'm unfortunately unable to share mine.
[09:06] jonaslund has joined the channel
[09:07] Lingerance: You also have the option of dnode, but you'll have to find a PHP library for that (it's also a JSON protocol)
[09:07] Layke: lol Yeah. I'm using websocket.io atm, if I could connect to that I would just use that.
[09:07] xDelph: hi guys, i have a problem to give to you (two in fact but the second is not the most important for now)
[09:08] Layke: Sorry socket.io
[09:08] xDelph: i use express and websocket-server to create my server
[09:08] xDelph: and the client (an iphone) is connecting on this

[09:44] stagas: xDelph: app.get callback (and the console.log) will only fire on a request, are you making a request to test it?

[14:56] context: jasonjs: then id use some sort of pubsub
[14:56] context: not websockets.
[14:57] JasonJS: context: Why is that?
[14:57] blax has joined the channel
[14:57] context: cause its a proper solution. you want to send messages, pubsub is a real solution. websocket is just "lets make a connection"
[14:57] shiawuen has joined the channel
[14:57] mikeal has joined the channel
[14:57] joshkehn: pubsub can be used over a websocket.
[14:58] joshkehn: A websocket is just the underlying protocol.
[14:58] joshkehn: Like HTTP or whatever.
[14:58] context: joshkehn: yes, but why not use a solution that already exists. now HE is in charge of connection management, message management, etc etc etc
[14:58] joshkehn: Not if you use something like socket.io instead.
[14:58] context: message passing, message holding, queueing,
[14:58] context: logging
[14:58] joshkehn: ja ja, I know what you're saying.
[14:58] Glenjamin: its like the difference between TCP and HTTP (sort of)
[14:58] context: like i said.... proper solution
[14:59] robertfw has joined the channel
[14:59] MooGoo: maybe one day node will have shared memory capabilities
[14:59] blax: hello there, is there a way to make async http request that will retry itself after some timeout (if not succeeded)?
[14:59] Glenjamin: websockets are a stream, not a protocol
[14:59] crashing has joined the channel
[14:59] context: glenjamin: correct.
[14:59] DrMcKay: MooGoo++
[14:59] v8bot_:  DrMcKay has given a beer to MooGoo. MooGoo now has 3 beers.
[14:59] Glenjamin: well, technically they *are* a protocol
[14:59] joshkehn: Glenjamin: It's a layer on top of HTTP
[14:59] DrMcKay: that would be awesome
[14:59] joshkehn: So it's sort-of like a protocol. 
[14:59] joshkehn: But not “technically” it's own.
[14:59] Glenjamin: yeah, but it behaves much like a protocol-agnostic transport stream for building protocols on top of
[14:59] joshkehn: Right
[15:00] joshkehn: So you want to serve content to a lot of people, you don't say you're going to use “HTTP”
[15:00] kevwil has joined the channel
[15:00] joshkehn: You say I'm going to use Apache to serve over the HTTP protocol.
[15:00] context: wow. this is actually happening
[15:00] Renegade001 has joined the channel
[15:01] context: yes! you CAN use websocket. yes! it WILL work. BUT you ARE reinventing the wheel for what you asked for.
[15:01] context: now get back to work ! :p
[15:01] joshkehn: Hence why I suggested socket.io. 
[15:01] MooGoo: apparently DrMkay got me to level 1
[15:01] joshkehn: ACTION flips back to vim

[15:24] broofa: tbranyen??? what is... sizzle?  jsdom/apricot seem to have been around a while.

[15:25] broofa: tbranyen - okay, but this is like 100x slower than I would expect.  e.g. doing "find(*)" to get all elements in http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.12/api/ takes several minutes. :(
[15:25] bEEEviz: is this way "best practice"?
[15:26] louissmit has joined the channel

[15:28] mikeal: sorry, got caught up with some other stuf
[15:28] tbranyen: lz: jquery is a cross browser normalization lib
[15:28] tbranyen: what does that have anything to do with node
[15:28] DrMcKay: mikeal: OK, not a problem :)
[15:28] tbranyen: really confuses me that people want to use it there

[18:48] c4milo: yep
[18:48] tjholowaychuk: fair enough
[18:49] tjholowaychuk: well i mean if you're getting specific with the body
[18:49] tjholowaychuk: just do
[18:49] c4milo: I guess normally http clients follow the Location

[19:05] Draggor: Getting everything to garbage collect correctly was interesting
[19:05] kkaefer: yeah, it's just doxygen, but still pretty useful
[19:05] brianc: is there a good node module which pipes 1 incomming stream into many outgoing streams handling the pause/resume stuff ala stream.pipe does for a 1->1 ?

A few months ago I saw some startup site that sells high fashion products, but lets users setup their own stores to sell these products to their friends.

[19:14] jonaslund: was some 2-4x slower than V8 last year
[19:14] MooGoo: the only use case I could really think of was implemnting a string format function that could use variables from the scope it was called in
[19:14] MooGoo: instead of needing to be passed explicetly
[19:14] jonaslund: for my trivial tests thatis :)
[19:14] jonaslund: but it lacked any kind of type specialization so well
[19:15] arpunk has joined the channel
[19:15] MooGoo: that doesnt sound bad
[19:15] MooGoo: actually
[19:15] jonaslund: (that was pretty ok though compared to rhinos 22x slower :D )
[19:16] jonaslund: the JVM is pretty bad for implementing languaes with dynamic typing though

[19:16] CoverSlide: jdk<7 yes
[19:16] jonaslund: even with invokedynamic in java7 they will still need to put any nonlocal numbers into objects
[19:17] zmbmartin has joined the channel
[19:18] Ned_ has joined the channel
[19:18] jonaslund: so given A and B being 2 integers you will get an memory allocation for C=A+B (to be fair V8 need to create an object for double values once it leaves the local scopes last i checked)

[19:25] ErikCorryV8: jonaslund: Yes, only doubles in local variables are unboxed.
[19:25] mraleph has joined the channel
[19:25] ErikCorryV8: And in arrays.
[19:25] ErikCorryV8: But inlining can stretch the definition of 'local'
[19:26] ErikCorryV8: V8 is different from all other VMs there by the way.
[19:26] ErikCorryV8: All the others have unboxed doubles as a basic datatype.
[19:27] ErikCorryV8: We judged that doing the same would speed up fp-intensive code, but at the expense of making the whole of the rest of the VM more complex and slower.
[19:27] Me1000 has joined the channel
[19:27] ErikCorryV8: So we didn't do it :-)
[19:27] jonaslund: yeah i've been looking at making my toy compiler into something proper and that's one thing i've pondered on a fair bit
[19:28] ErikCorryV8: On average we are still ahead of Kraken, the most FP heavy benchmark out there.  So it's working out fine I think.
[19:28] jonaslund: (mainly from experience writing some other toy compiler ages ago that did just that... eschewed "big" basic types for word sized objects all over the place and boxed doubles)
[19:28] mraleph: I disagree that fat values make system a lot more complex.
[19:28] wbednarski has joined the channel
[19:28] mraleph: they just make it a lot more fatter
[19:28] tbranyen: trim that fat
[19:28] jonaslund: actually
[19:28] ErikCorryV8: The others mostly use the NaN trick.  There are around 2^52 different ways to code NaN.  You can use that space to code all integers and pointers.
[19:28] jonaslund: i came up with an idea that might be good actually
[19:29] jonaslund: (Do credit me if you find it useful ;) )
[19:29] ErikCorryV8: mraleph: Search the VM for all the places where we test for a Smi.  Now you have to test for an unboxed double too.
[19:29] CoverSlide: oooh: http://arewefastyet.com/ <<-- Mozilla is really close in kraken
[19:29] mraleph: ErikCorryV8: smi goes away.
[19:29] jonaslund: SMI ?

[19:29] mraleph: ErikCorryV8: unboxed local ints come

[19:29] tjholowaychuk: iirc
[19:30] jonaslund: ah
[19:30] tjholowaychuk: i read v8 on the plane
[19:30] tjholowaychuk: haha
[19:30] tylerstalder has joined the channel
[19:30] tjholowaychuk: took me a while too i was like wtf is a smi
[19:30] jonaslund: the basic problem with nan-coding would be that you add overhead for all non-doubles
[19:30] mraleph: ErikCorryV8:  but maybe you can also have smi.. benifits are unclear.
[19:30] martinisoft has joined the channel
[19:30] mraleph: but it's all purely theoretical...
[19:31] bradleymeck: I just wish function allocation vs object allocation was closer (though last i checked was like a year ago)
[19:31] jonaslund: one encoding i was thinking of was having "int32 type; int32 values", where type is just a type tag
[19:31] jonaslund: APRT
[19:31] jonaslund: from a NaN mask
[19:31] ErikCorryV8: The others have Smis still AFAIK (Smi = small-integer:  A 31 bit integer tagged as a misaligned pointer)
[19:31] jonaslund: so basically you'd store a type
[19:31] jonaslund: but if any "high" bit is set
[19:31] jonaslund: you know that it's a NaN tagged value
[19:31] jonaslund: then when doing double operations you xor
[19:31] mraleph: ErikCorryV8: into NaN box you can put int32
[19:31] ErikCorryV8: (Actually the pointers are the ones that are misaligned, the Smis have a 0 at the end.
[19:33] ErikCorryV8: Jonaslund, there are different ways to encode it with different tradeoffs.  But the world is moving towards 48+ bits of address space so you better have a solution there too.
[19:33] mraleph: hehe
[19:33] jonaslund: yeah this is a 32bit thing

[19:42] klovadis has joined the channel
[19:43] lz: erikcorryv8 you get a callback
[19:43] CoverSlide: doesn't the callback get called every time you run the function?
[19:44] AvianFlu: ErikCorryV8, fs.readFile is a convenience method that will do a whole file at once for you
[19:44] AvianFlu: that might help
[19:45] AvianFlu: I've either used that or fs.createReadStream, though, so I can't really say :(
[19:45] CoverSlide: I'd prefer fs.createReadStream() and .on('data' and .on('end'
[19:45] Ned_ has joined the channel
[19:45] lz: yea seems like callbacks for file read always get called and it's up to you to throw errors

[20:07] hydrozen: ianl`: yes, but lets say i want to get a record with some attribute = something and that was updated last
[20:07] joshkehn: Just use find() and grab the first cursor. 
[20:07] mraleph: ErikCorryV8: why not use readFileSync?
[20:07] hydrozen: joshkehn: so i just use find and specity limit(1) ?
[20:07] mraleph: ErikCorryV8: no callbacks.
[20:07] joshkehn: hydrozen: Sure
[20:07] joshkehn: findOne is just an interface to find()
[20:07] joshkehn: https://gist.github.com/1235880

[20:11] tjholowaychuk: not really a router but it might be what you're looking for
[20:11] CoverSlide: ErikCorryV8: it appears the best you can do is compare your length parameter to the bytesRead argument in the callback

[20:12] whitman: AvianFlu, yea, looking at it now.
[20:12] CoverSlide: but fs.createReadStream and .on('data' and .on('end' i think would be the preferred method if you want to read the whole file incrementally

[22:13] kenperkins: we're thinking of https by default, but don't know if we want node to do the termination
[22:13] kenperkins: what do you guys do
[22:13] bnoordhuis: kenperkins: do you have specialized hardware like an f5 load balancer?
[22:13] kenperkins: not yet
[22:13] kenperkins: we're all cloud

[22:15] qbert65536: F5 ?  Never heard of it
[22:15] halcyon918: if you have to ask... too much

[22:16] kenperkins: be honest, I'm in a well funded startup

[22:22] kenperkins: halcyon918: do you have an idea of what something would cost me?
[22:23] bnoordhuis: kenperkins: node can handle ssl (albeit a lot slower than plain http)
[22:23] bnoordhuis: or you can have haproxy do the ssl termination for you
[22:23] bnoordhuis: if money is an issue, that is
[22:23] kenperkins: yea I know, we do https termination with node on some admin machines, but I don't know how it scales
[22:23] kenperkins: I thought HAProxy doesn't do SSL termination
[22:24] chrislorenz has joined the channel
[22:24] onlytracks has joined the channel
[22:24] halcyon918: kenperkins They have a whole host of hardware options, and they vary depending upon quantity and stuff... I'm at a big company, so I'm sure we get the big ones and heavily discounted, so I probably couldn't give you a number that would be accurate for you
[22:24] halcyon918: I can ping some people, though, if you're interested...
[22:24] kenperkins: gotcha
[22:25] kenperkins: ok, so haproxy can route ssl, but not terminate it
[22:26] halcyon918: apache can do SSL offloading
[22:26] halcyon918: erm, I'm pretty sure it can
[22:26] bnoordhuis: kenperkins: right you are
[22:27] halcyon918: I've had HTTPS to apache and then the HTTP request proxied to Tomcat
[22:27] bnoordhuis: halcyon918: apache does
[22:27] kenperkins: I want to figure out what's the best way to handle the overhead of ssl termination: opinions vary: some people say just let your application cluster handle it because it's easy to scale out an app cluster. Some people say front your apps with nginx/apache or an application that specializes in ssl termination
[22:27] bnoordhuis: i can dream the mod_ssl source code...
[22:27] kenperkins: others say use dedicated hardware like bigIP etc
[22:27] bnoordhuis: oh, the choice is easy if you have dedicated hardware
[22:28] kenperkins: I don't yet
[22:28] kenperkins: but I Could if I needed to
[22:28] bnoordhuis: if you don't, just terminate on the front-end server
[22:28] bnoordhuis: if the load becomes too high (unlikely!) turn it into a reverse proxy
[22:28] halcyon918: if you have dedicated hardware, that's often the most efficient...
[22:28] halcyon918: it also reduces the complexity of your application deployments to offload it
[22:28] bnoordhuis: ssl overhead was a big deal ten years ago

[22:29] bnoordhuis: hmm, it's not that hard to set up is it?
[22:30] bnoordhuis: you can automate it with a 20 line puppet script
[22:30] halcyon918: HAH... hard, no, but you don't know the kinda people I work with
[22:30] bnoordhuis: that's true, i don't
[22:31] bnoordhuis: tell me
[22:31] halcyon918: it also depends on your operations environment... I don't control the deployment of my application to QA, Preview and Prod... having to also account for SSL in the app config and deployment is another spot Operations can get it wrong

[22:33] kenperkins: I don't even worry about setting up ssl on my front end
