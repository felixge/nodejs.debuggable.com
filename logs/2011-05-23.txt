[00:55] tilgovi: sec... lemme link you to the source
[00:55] tilgovi: mscdex: https://github.com/creationix/node-leveldb/blob/master/src/helpers.cc#L74
[00:56] tilgovi: my understanding (which is minimal), is that the use of HandleScope here is not quite right
[00:56] tilgovi: lines 82 and 87 don't need it, because it can inherit one, since our argument is a Handle<>
[00:56] tilgovi: but lines 74 and 78 should declare a HandleScope, because they're about to pass a Handle<> to a function
[00:57] vyvea has joined the channel
[00:57] dnolen has joined the channel
[00:57] tbranyen: tilgovi: my understanding of handlescope is that it creates the scope to bind any local objects created in a function scope
[00:57] maqr has joined the channel
[00:57] tilgovi: then at line 92 I should probably add a HandleScope... yes?
[00:57] tbranyen: and a scope.Close too yea
[00:58] tbranyen: since you're creating local objects there
[00:58] vyvea: Hello, maybe is this http://laktek.com/2010/05/04/implementing-web-socket-servers-with-node-js/ example in node v0.4.8?
[00:58] tilgovi: do you have to explicitly scope.Close or will a HandleScope on the stack get cleaned up nicely for me?

[01:08] tbranyen: cool thanks
[01:08] tilgovi: tbranyen: if you check out this article, in the HandleScope section, I think that seems like an accurate summary to me: http://www.homepluspower.info/2010/06/v8-javascript-engine-tutorial-part-1.html

[01:09] tbranyen: haha never came across that
[01:09] alek_br_ has joined the channel
[01:10] tilgovi: If you receive a Local<> as an argument there must be a HandleScope already, so you don't need to make your own (unless you want to or you have reason to believe the outer HandleScope is longer lived than you need)
[01:10] duckxx: is it ok if this comes up when i do a ./configure :       Checking for header port.h               : not found 
[01:10] duckxx: Checking for header sys/event.h          : not found 
[01:10] duckxx: Checking for sync_file_range(2)          : no 
[01:10] tilgovi: duckxx: nothing is a problem unless configure stops prematurely.
[01:10] duckxx: o ok
[01:10] duckxx: so i dont need those things ?
[01:10] tilgovi: you should expect it to not find some things... it's checking what you have or don't have so it can choose the right alternative

[04:01] mikeric: what is the simplest way to write 'hello\n' every n seconds? (in the browser).
[04:01] mikeric: it seems that using setTimeout works fine when using curl, but the browser will halt for this.
[04:01] JohnnyL: Aria: states such as user variables/closures, etc.
[04:01] Aria: JohnnyL: I don't think this is a property of an interpreter exactly...
[04:02] Aria: But node doesn't do continuations or anything weird, so local variables are probably not going to be around between requests.

[04:42] materialdesigner: Has anyone ever heard of a node module that makes it easier to write callbacks? I remember seeing it a while back, but can't seem to remember what it was called.
[04:42] chjj: depends on what you want to do
[04:42] cloudhead_ has joined the channel
[04:42] materialdesigner: or not easier to write, but easier to read?
[04:43] gkatsev: there are stuff like streamline.js

[04:43] newobj: this is more focused on providing an api, with authenticated users, rather than serving up an html heavy website
[04:43] chjj: materialdesigner: thats a pretty vague description, theres about 100 different control flow tools
[04:43] gkatsev: Why not just make it a named function and then put that name in rather than placing the function inside and have sphagetti code

[04:46] nodjsmap has joined the channel
[04:46] superjudge has joined the channel
[04:47] mscdex: duckxx: what is that settings file for?
[04:47] gkatsev: wjwoodward: node-static and express do different things.
[04:47] chjj: drupal?
[04:47] duckxx: for drupal and nodejs integration
[04:47] duckxx: yes
[04:47] duckxx: i hit a wall
[04:48] duckxx: and not sure what to do now.. i got so far.. i spent like 4 hours to get to this point
[04:48] mscdex: i don't understand why there needs to be "settings" for integration
[04:48] mscdex: isn't there some http auth api for drupal?
[04:48] wjwoodward: gkatsev: what is the difference. I am personally looking to server html, css and js of a Joyent no.de machine
[04:48] newobj has left the channel
[04:49] chjj: wjwoodward: node-static is a static file server, express is a framework
[04:49] duckxx: yea in the readme file it just says to run the command ' node server.js ' 
[04:49] duckxx: but it wont work since the configure settings are working im guessing
[04:49] mscdex: it seems like there should be some drupal module that gives you a rest api
[04:49] gkatsev: wjwoodward: node-static is for serving static files like html, css and js. Express is a middleware and router and other thinsg
[04:49] mscdex: that'd be the easiest route i'd think
[04:50] scoates: chjj: any chance you're around?
[04:50] chjj: yeah
[04:50] scoates: hey. I'm working with node-tiny. Is _key supposed to be populated on the result of a .find() ?
[04:50] scoates: (I'm getting _key: null)
[04:50] context: drupal is kind of enterprisey
[04:51] chjj: scoates: hmm, its null, not undefined?
[04:51] duckxx: im getting this error when i run this command: 'node server.js'   screenshot of error: http://prntscr.com/1x7e6
[04:51] wjwoodward: thanks chjj and gkatsev. as you can probably tell i'm new to node and servers in general, should I be looking at node-static or nginx to replace apache?
[04:51] context: duckxx: did you read the error
[04:51] context: duckxx: whats line 14 of server.js
[04:51] duckxx: o duh
[04:51] scoates: chjj: oh.. I wonder if my key generator is accidentally generating null. Let me verify that first (and if so, I apologize for the noise)
[04:51] duckxx: cant find socket.io
[04:51] duckxx: oh tat was the real problem actually it doesnt see tat add on
[04:52] context: duckxx: its generally a good idea to 'READ' stuff before copying and pasting it to dozens of people. that could have been your love confession for your neighbors husband
[04:53] chjj: scoates: that really shouldnt be happening, are you using the latest commit?
[04:53] scoates: chjj: let me make sure the problem isn't on my side (it probably is, now that I've thought about it some more)
[04:53] duckxx: how do i find where the node modules are installed ?
[04:54] context: duckxx: if you are using npm >= 1.0 they get installed to node_modules in the root of your project

[05:00] duckxx: or install i mean
[05:00] materialdesigner: no. in your server.js, you just need to add 'var socket = require("socket.io")'
[05:00] duckxx: not make
[05:00] context: or did you just do it for the hell of it
[05:00] materialdesigner: to include the module
[05:00] duckxx: someone told me to do a -g

[05:01] duckxx: it installs it where any nodejs app can make use of the module ?
[05:01] context: duckxx: npm install socket.io in the root of your project
[05:01] sreeix has joined the channel
[05:01] context: duckxx: wrong.
[05:01] scoates: chjj: I'm using the version from npm. It seems a couple strange things are happening. First, I can't successfully find() right after a set() -- is this expected? (if I kill the process and restart it, the find() works, but it gives me _key: null (this is the 2nd strange thing))
[05:01] context: npm 1.0 DOES NOT work like pre 1.0
[05:02] duckxx: ok so should i uninstall it ? with the -g option ?   use the command ' npm uninstall socket.io -g '   ?
[05:02] mscdex: Fenda: not sure, but here's what i generally use: https://gist.github.com/753111
[05:02] context: duckxx: if you want to ?
[05:02] duckxx: and then i goto my modules/nodejs  folder and use the command ' npm install socket.io '   ?
[05:02] context: i install stuff with -g so i can use link with them later.
[05:03] duckxx: yea tat is what i did
[05:03] context: i have no clue what modules/nodejs is
[05:03] duckxx: i sym linked it
[05:03] Fenda: mscdex: thanks. is that your app.conf in /etc/init ?
[05:03] scoates: chjj: ignore the 2nd problem. I was stupidly passing my.uniqueId instead of my.uniqueId()
[05:03] context: i said the root of your project.
[05:03] mscdex: Fenda: yeah
[05:03] context: duckxx: npm -v
[05:03] Fenda: mscdex: im new to upstart but the .conf by itself would be fine right? don't need to touch init.d or anything?
[05:04] mscdex: Fenda: correct, just drop the .conf in /etc/init
[05:04] chjj: scoates: hmmm, let me see if i can reproduce it, for now i recommend using `.fetch`, ive been suspecting lately that the mongo style queries are kind of fragile
[05:04] Fenda: mscdex: thanks. the name of conf must match the .js file name?
[05:04] mscdex: no
[05:04] context: here and i was gonna watch a movie before passing out
[05:05] duckxx: root of my project.. wat im taking it as .. is the directory i and running the 'server.js' file from... which is located in   /home/xxx/modules/nodejs
[05:05] scoates: chjj: oh, sure. I'll try that.
[05:05] context: duckxx: whats `npm -v` respond with ?
[05:05] eksmith has joined the channel
[05:05] duckxx: 1.0.6
[05:05] context: duckxx: cd ~/modules/nodejs ; npm install socket.io
[05:05] chjj: scoates: `fetch` will also be faster, im going to update the npm version with the latest commit, its a lot nicer, sorting is more optimized
[05:05] context: you will then see a node_modules directory there.
[05:06] context: node server.js and it will successfully find socket.io
[05:06] scoates: chjj: sounds good
[05:06] mscdex: Fenda: also on a slightly unrelated note, are you using setuid and setgid in the service script?
[05:06] mscdex: process.setgid/setuid
[05:06] mscdex: so that you're not running the chat server with elevated privileges?
[05:07] kohai: @chriskau: to build node.js using llvm run 'export CC=llvm-gcc CXX=llvm-g++' in the shell before running 'configure' and 'make' #llvm #nodejs

[05:28] halfhalo-sick: nice
[05:28] mikeric: that works fine when i curl a get to the server, but in the browser it just waits.
[05:29] Fenda_ has joined the channel
[05:29] gkatsev: mikeric: I don't think it works like that.
[05:29] gkatsev: mikeric: you need that setInterval clientside
[05:29] gkatsev: not server-side
[05:29] jaket has joined the channel
[05:29] gkatsev: or at least, you need to set up something like websockets or ajax longpolling or socket.io for client and serverside to talk to each other
[05:30] danfo has joined the channel
[05:31] gkatsev: halfhalo-sick: it can probably be shortened by a few characters even
[05:32] mikeric: gkatsev: ok, that makes sense.
[05:33] gkatsev: mikeric: basically, you are never ending the http request since it's only res.write
[05:33] gkatsev: so, the browser hangs

[05:33] kohai: @azzamallow: is #nodejs mature enough to use for a production system yet?
[05:34] mikeric: so curl just works differently, i guess.
[05:34] mikeric: it doesn't wait until the request has ended.

[06:08] deviantlinux: thanks for no responses...lol
[06:09] bingomanatee: I think the best answer to that is that the bulk of Node.js's functionality is based on the v8 JavaScript language which is pretty damn stable. 
[06:09] drachenstern: deviantlinux I think you have just chosen a slow time of day to come around
[06:10] eyesUnclouded has joined the channel
[06:10] bingomanatee: With all due respect to the immense work being done IN node, the fundamental system, file and web access code seems pretty damn stable to me. 
[06:10] gkatsev: yes, it's 2am on the east coast and it's 11pm on the westcoast. They're out partying
[06:10] bingomanatee: But like all languages, subcomponents done IN node vary from component to component. 
[06:10] gkatsev: 0.5.x is unstable, 0.4.x is stable :3
[06:11] sub_pop has joined the channel
[06:12] bingomanatee: Considering how many projects I've seen done in PHP and Ruby that blow up because they are memory pigs, I would point out that even a "Stable" language is capable of being used to create a very very unstable website :D 
[06:12] Garo_: I'm trying to debug a bug where I'm trying to find out where a function was called. Unfortunately due to the callback nature of node, the stacktrace is useless because it trails back to the event loop. The function does have a callback which it calls after it's done. How can I print out where the callback function is located? console.dir() shows just [Function]. A file/line number would be very handy
[06:13] Garo_: is this possible?
[06:13] bingomanatee: I'd really have to say that in my experience stability is not really achievable with today's technology - unless you consider consistent failure to be a form of stability :D
[06:13] gkatsev: have you tried the long-stack-traces lib thingy?
[06:13] mscdex: jeesh, that article by that java enthusiast is almost as bad as that ibm article

[06:13] matjas has joined the channel
[06:14] bingomanatee: Garo_ try using named functions instead of anonymous callbacks - that makes your callback stacks cleaner in some circumstances.
[06:14] gkatsev: https://github.com/tlrobinson/long-stack-traces
[06:15] Garo_: gkatsev: thanks
[06:15] bingomanatee: Or if you are really devoted to this probem you can create a tracer system that keeps an artificial stack of your progress as a function parameter and passes it along through with each call
[06:15] bingomanatee: but remember to clone the stack before ypu pass it downstream. 
[06:15] gkatsev: you can build a monad :)
[06:16] Garo_: bingomanatee: yeah, I'm doing those. I this case the stacktrace trails back to IOWatcher
[06:16] mscdex: Garo_: you might also be able to do: (new Error()).stack to get the stack as a string

[06:17] bingomanatee: This is sadly one area where there are no perfect soltuions in node esp if you have a penchant for anonymous functions. 
[06:17] mscdex: then yeah, you might need the long stack traces

[06:23] kohai: @pmbauer: node.js has 1 redeeming trick: evented I/O. Everything else is sub-enterprise-grade. Mature EIO stacks exist, so why bother? #erlang #netty
[06:24] bingomanatee: drachenstein: Nuby (https://github.com/bingomanatee/nuby) attempts to address this - it has default sscaffolding, forms and models to boot - but it is still a bit volatile and obtuse.

[06:26] drachenstern: bingomanatee that appears to still concat all the routes in one megafile
[06:27] drachenstern: I'm looking to define each route (so one url and all it's HTTP VERB components) in one file (effectively one file per url)
[06:27] bingomanatee: Not eacatly - each controller has its own subset of routes
[06:27] drachenstern: oh, I missed that, like I said, still reading
[06:27] bingomanatee: well each controller has its own directory - its classic MVC
[06:28] bingomanatee: http://www.wonderlandlabs.com/wll_drupal/os/node/nuby.html is good place to start.

[06:29] drachenstern: there you go then ;)
[06:29] drachenstern: does it allow me to do something like `/route/path/:id` ?
[06:29] bingomanatee: The upshot is that (and I have to give most of the credit to TJ for ripping off the conventions from Ruby for me) you don't have to explicitly define any routes til you vary
[06:29] bingomanatee: yes
[06:30] drachenstern: have you got an example that does that?
[06:30] tekky has joined the channel
[06:30] bingomanatee: You can define any custom routes you want but if you have a controller named member with an action named show then members/:id is automatically routed towards that aciton. 
[06:30] drachenstern: let me repeat that so I know that I got it:
[06:31] bingomanatee: sure.
[06:31] drachenstern: if I have a controller named member (controllers/member.js) then a request to members/:id will be routed to that controller?
[06:31] bingomanatee: yes specifically that controllers' show action 
[06:31] bingomanatee: (presuming a GET access of course)
[06:31] bickie has joined the channel
[06:32] drachenstern: even tho `member` != `members` yes?
[06:32] bingomanatee: I took the express example's MVC system and ran with it. 
[06:32] bingomanatee: yes inflect will pluralize the urls for you. 
[06:32] drachenstern: yeah, all presumptions active here, unless explicitly stated ;)
[06:32] drachenstern: ah, ok
[06:33] bingomanatee: You could adjust that to your liking by messing with the loader.js file in mvc/controllers but by default you get Railsesque pluralization. 
[06:34] bingomanatee: http://www.wonderlandlabs.com/wll_drupal/node/290 demonstrates all the default path/action mappings - and yes it inflects to pluralize the controllers.

[06:35] bingomanatee: Sure. 
[06:35] drachenstern: I hope you won't be too upset if I keep pushing for others with their alternate views throughout the day
[06:36] bingomanatee: Keep in mind that like most other people doing this, my work stems from TJ's basic MVC example in epress.js
[06:36] drachenstern: I recognize the benefits of using super-stacks like Express+Connect (and even further, as you've done) but right now I'm learning some stuff so playing with a lot lower level stuff rather than building on top of all those stacks
[06:36] bingomanatee: That is the simplest possible starting point for routing and there are plenty of other alternative patterns and strategies in the express example folder.

[06:38] bickie: say I have some blocking operation which may or may not return a value, such as: http://pastie.org/private/zc7xnqvx0dehrq1jhn358w
[06:38] mitor: if that makes even remote sense.. yes
[06:38] qFox has joined the channel
[06:38] drachenstern: well, it's a webserver and lets you define everything you want it to do, so ...
[06:38] mitor: so its' a web server.
[06:38] drachenstern: sure
[06:39] drachenstern: but it's a lot more "bare" than the likes of IIS or Apache
[06:39] bickie: is the only way to deal with the resulting object to create a separate function that deals with the object? (as there's no way to "fall through" the if blocks as you would with non-async programing
[06:39] drachenstern: and it's built on a different _everything_ than those two are
[06:39] mitor: and it can serve say.. rail apps?

[06:40] drachenstern: what do you mean?
[06:40] drachenstern: what's the Apache "edge"?
[06:40] mitor: well, in a nutshell, what makes Node different then conventional httpd's ?
[06:40] bickie: drachenstern: sorry, here's a better way to express the question
[06:40] drachenstern: that you write the code for it in javascript?
[06:40] mitor: that it?
[06:41] drachenstern: that you work with a different tech stack than you would in other languages etc?
[06:41] pickels has joined the channel
[06:41] drachenstern: that it scales widely pretty easily
[06:41] bickie: what's the a nice async way to write this: http://pastie.org/private/rtznhzugbki0ogrzceerjw
[06:41] drachenstern: that it uses a lot less resources overall initially
[06:41] mitor: its just that i can't quite wrap my head around 'writing code for a web server'
[06:41] mitor: normally i'd write code for an interpreter (ruby, php, etc)
[06:41] drachenstern: @mitor this is currently one level below that for some of us
[06:42] drachenstern: for others, you can just write (for example) jade files 
[06:42] bickie: mitor: node.js is an async I/O web app server (like nginx) that natively speaks Javascript
[06:42] drachenstern: there are many interpretors out there, but I don't know that there are any ruby or php interpreters (I'm sure there must be some day soon)
[06:42] mitor: i'm obviously gonna have to read more about this
[06:42] drachenstern: yeah, I would suggest starting at the ole WP
[06:42] mitor: wp ?
[06:42] drachenstern: @mitor before you go
[06:42] drachenstern: wikipedia
[06:43] mitor: ah
[06:43] mitor: i was aiming for the docs
[06:43] bickie: mitor: it's closer to an app server than a webserver
[06:43] drachenstern: consider that we write most of our web-code to be either HTML or javascript, yes?
[06:43] bickie: in that it can do things other than HTTP for example
[06:43] mitor: right..
[06:43] bickie: it's most close to twisted (the python project)
[06:43] bickie: except for JS :)
[06:43] drachenstern: so this allows us to use the same language for both the client and the server
[06:43] Marak has joined the channel
[06:43] drachenstern: we can write javascript on the server
[06:43] drachenstern: we can write javascript on the client
[06:43] AvianFlu has joined the channel
[06:43] mitor: but javascript doesn't actually 'render' anything
[06:44] drachenstern: neither does PHP
[06:44] drachenstern: neither does ruby
[06:44] mitor: well i mean, sure but php/ruby 'generate' stuff that *does* render
[06:44] drachenstern: so does javascript
[06:44] bickie: so can JS
[06:44] drachenstern: javascript is a language, just like ruby
[06:44] mitor: well not in any practical sense
[06:44] drachenstern: I can do this in javascript or ruby or php:
[06:44] mitor: nobody writes web pages in js
[06:44] bickie: mitor: what language/framework are you most familiar with?
[06:45] mitor: thus far, php
[06:45] mitor: moving towards rails
[06:45] bickie: kk
[06:45] bickie: so you know in rails, when you're developing
[06:45] drachenstern: return "<html><head><title>" this title "</title></head><body></body></html>"
[06:45] bickie: you start the dev webserver
[06:45] mitor: just spent my very first $25 on an eBook :)
[06:45] bickie: and it fires up a ruby process
[06:45] bickie: and initializes everything
[06:45] bickie: (or have you not gotten that far?)
[06:45] mitor: right. WEBrick
[06:45] mitor: sure have
[06:45] bickie: yerp
[06:45] bickie: so at that point
[06:45] drachenstern: same thing here with node
[06:45] bickie: you're ONLY running ruby
[06:45] bickie: there's no apache, etc, etc
[06:46] bickie: you just have a ruby process
[06:46] bickie: and you can write ruby code
[06:46] bickie: and it does "stuff"
[06:46] bickie: and then serves HTML (or whatever) to the client
[06:46] mitor: well.. actually, WEBrick is only serving the 'ready'-html. Ruby executes, Irb substitutes and WEBrick serves
[06:46] bickie: make sense so far?
[06:46] mitor: same deal with php
[06:46] drachenstern: @mitor I think you're trying to focus way too much on the underlying engines.
[06:46] bickie: yeah, though PHP needs it's own webserver 
[06:46] bickie: like apache
[06:46] bickie: anyway
[06:46] bickie: the point i'm getting at
[06:46] mitor: right
[06:47] bickie: is node.js is just like ruby in that example

[06:47] mitor: hmm
[06:47] bickie: many languages/envs do this
[06:48] bickie: tornado (the facebook released webserver) does this in python for example
[06:48] bickie: app server AND web server
[06:48] mitor: interesting...
[06:48] bickie: now, I don't want to confuse you, but - 
[06:48] mitor: i mean, it's different... but how's it better? other then the fact that it's a js-centric web/app server?
[06:48] sreeix_ has joined the channel
[06:48] bickie: ok
[06:49] bickie: the next part you need to understand is asynchronous I/O
[06:49] bickie: to get that
[06:49] mitor: I watched the presentation
[06:49] mitor: i get how requests can 'hang'
[06:49] mitor: well.. sort of 'get' :)
[06:49] kohai: @javameme: Java Non-blocking Servers, and What I Expect node.js to do if it is to Become Mature: node.js is getting a... http://tinyurl.com/3v8akug
[06:50] bickie: ok, so JS (and node) is very good at that
[06:50] mitor: strictly in practical terms... isn't that kind of like reinventing the wheel? I mean ajax already does that (well.. sort of 'that')
[06:50] drachenstern: ajax does that on the CLIENT
[06:50] drachenstern: this is on the SERVER
[06:50] bickie: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O http://www.slideshare.net/marcusf/nonblocking-io-event-loops-and-nodejs
[06:51] mitor: i realize that, but how's that better (rather then just 'different' ) ?
[06:51] bickie: well
[06:51] ezl has joined the channel
[06:51] emattias has joined the channel
[06:51] drachenstern: because evented-io is generally regarded (by those who understand both sides) to be better
[06:51] bickie: what happens if your server needs to contact a web service?
[06:51] bickie: say for example, it needs to hit up twitter to do twitter auth
[06:51] SamuraiJack has joined the channel
[06:51] bickie: and say twitter is slow
[06:51] bickie: and they're taking 15 seconds to do auths
[06:51] drachenstern: it lets the scheduler provide resources to the pieces that need resources "right now" while the "slower ops" take their time to get things done
[06:51] bickie: (which happens)
[06:51] mitor: conventionally, you'd send a request (in response to a DOM event) via Ajax, and the server would go out and fetch the data
[06:52] bickie: so your users all go to log in
[06:52] bickie: and your lovely fast page that used to take 200ms to render, now takes 15 seconds
[06:52] mitor: oh i see.. that's where the idle advantage comes in
[06:52] saebekassebil has joined the channel
[06:52] bickie: so say you usually have 2 requests per second to your site
[06:52] bickie: at 200ms/ request, all is ok, and your site stays up
[06:52] bickie: at 15 seconds per page load
[06:53] bickie: the requests just keep building and building and building
[06:53] bickie: and your whole site would come crashing down
[06:53] drachenstern: so mitor, if you recall basic OS premises, the scheduler will give each "thread" or "process" a certain timeslice. and if it sits there waiting on things to be read, it will take all those resources and "spin" while it's waiting on the resource. This avoids that entirely.
[06:53] drachenstern: thus you let the server get more done per timeslice.
[06:53] bickie: cos with PHP, you'd have to spawn 1000000 processes to deal with it
[06:53] bickie: non-blocking IO lets you do that
[06:53] mitor: hmm
[06:53] kohai: @piotrbuda: #Flex #CQRS stack - #BlazeDS for writes, #NodeJS for async updates of view... must check how it works
[06:53] bickie: cos idle (ie: waiting) processes take ostensibly no ressources
[06:53] mitor: well appache2 does have a pretty robust cue
[06:53] bickie: that's why friendfeed wrote tornado (non-blocking webserver in python)
[06:53] mitor: but it's nothing like this
[06:53] bickie: http://www.tornadoweb.org/
[06:54] drachenstern: it's NOTHING like this
[06:54] bickie: mitor: not really
[06:54] bickie: apache is actually the worst at that
[06:54] bickie: that's why nginx got so popular
[06:54] drachenstern: apache is great at serving (and caching) static files
[06:54] mitor: so is Node best for high traffic sites then?
[06:54] drachenstern: it was written initially back when that was all there was to do on the web
[06:54] mitor: drachenstern very true
[06:54] drachenstern: then people bolted on cgi and php and the rest
[06:54] drachenstern: node is best for high traffic sites "when the code is well written"
[06:55] saebekassebil: Hey guys, I've given my webhost a hard time, 'cause I asked for them to install node. They've downloaded the source, build it and placed in ~/bin/node. This is all fine! But when I try using it like 'node test.js' I get this weird error: 
[06:55] saebekassebil: FATAL ERROR: v8::Debug::SetDebugMessageDispatchHandler V8 is no longer usable
[06:55] drachenstern: when the code is shitty it's an even race for all the browsers
[06:55] bickie: node is best for high traffic sites that have high concurrency and potentially slow blocking operations
[06:55] bickie: that includes standard DB calls
[06:55] mitor: i see, that makes more sense
[06:55] drachenstern: @sakebekassebil is the "node binary" in your local path?
[06:55] saebekassebil: the node binary is placed
[06:55] drachenstern: also, I would rebuild node
[06:55] saebekassebil: ~/bin/node/bin/node
[06:56] saebekassebil: They've tried to rebuild it
[06:56] bickie: anyway, drachenstern back to my problem :) any idea how to neatly rewrite this in async stylez: http://pastie.org/private/rtznhzugbki0ogrzceerjw ?
[06:56] drachenstern: I don't get what about that is non-async, except for that long blocking call to set the inital value
[06:57] drachenstern: for that I would need to know what your non-async call is, does it have an async deriv?
[06:57] truedat101 has joined the channel
[06:57] mitor: thanks for the tut peeps!
[06:57] bickie: line 2 and 4 are both blocking
[06:57] saebekassebil: But i can still utilize: 'node -v'
[06:57] mitor: will read s'more...
[06:57] bickie: mitor: no probs
[06:57] kohai: @ssig33: node.js でクエリを順番に打っていきたい時、普通に書くとクエリ一個進む毎に 1 段階インデントが深くなっていくので、辛い

[06:57] mitor has left the channel
[06:57] bickie: drachenstern: async should look something like this http://pastie.org/private/zc7xnqvx0dehrq1jhn358w - but hard to deal with results neatly

[06:59] MGT: wondering if anyone had encountered that before/knew what to do (there was a similar problem logged on the node git page, but no solution)
[06:59] drach: what lib are you using for dbquery?
[07:00] drach: MGT: idk, I don't have OSX
[07:00] MGT: k
[07:00] bickie: drach: that's just pseudo code, not my actual code
[07:00] drach: what libs r u using?
[07:00] drach: do the libs have async?
[07:00] bickie: mongodb driver
[07:00] bickie: yep
[07:00] bickie: all async
[07:00] bickie: that's the prob
[07:00] drach: what's the prob?
[07:00] bickie: I end up in two different places with the same object
[07:00] bickie: you can't "fall through"
[07:00] bickie: if you look in the sync example
[07:00] drach: oh, so you're saying how do you ensure you have an object
[07:01] bickie: no matter what happens, by the time I get to line 6, I def have the object
[07:01] drach: hang on, thinking for a moment
[07:01] bickie: no matter how I got it
[07:01] bickie: but in the async example
[07:01] bickie: it's very hard to achieve the same effect

[07:02] bingomanatee: bickie - I would suggest looking into my gate library https://github.com/bingomanatee/gate
[07:02] drach: if(myThing==undefined){ /* get the item */; IGotItCallback(); } else { IGotItCallback(); } <-- why wouldn't that work?
[07:02] meso_ has joined the channel
[07:03] bingomanatee: it is designed to coordinate one or more actions and wait til they are all done to execute a function. 
[07:03] bickie: drach: yeah, I can do it by calling a common callback
[07:03] drach: that's how I would coord it
[07:03] bingomanatee: By the way it is if (typeof(foo) == 'undefined')  
[07:03] bickie: but it means I need to invent yet _another_ function just to do something fairly simple
[07:03] bingomanatee: there is no actual undefined token in JavaScript - its not like null.
[07:03] drach: but that's not simple
[07:03] bickie: bingomanatee: yeah, ok, will look into something like that
[07:03] bickie: bingomanatee:  aah yeah, sorry, I've been writing in coffeescript :)
[07:03] drach: bingomanatee if thats at me, mine was supposed to be pseudo
[07:04] bingomanatee: well pseudo problems get pseudo solutions

[07:04] bickie: :)
[07:04] mAritz has joined the channel
[07:06] hybsch has joined the channel
[07:06] drach: so bickie the thing is, you have to presume that each "go do something" is its own async step, and you can put shortcircuit branching in place to skip an async callback, but each "thing" you want to do is one more callback in the chain, yes?

[07:06] Marak: ryah: auto-op, you
[07:07] bickie: basically the whole concept of "do some optional async step" is messy
[07:07] bickie: do in series, do in parallel is not to bad
[07:07] bickie: but "do in this order with some steps being optional" is tricky :)
[07:07] drach: so you see where you need to insert a new async step (go get a new one if it doesn't exist yet) means you need a new pair of callbacks

[07:10] bickie: drach: just worked out another potential way: https://github.com/caolan/async#waterfall (I already use this lib)
[07:11] bickie: you just do each step as a series of cascading IO ops and skip the ones you don't need
[07:11] drach: that would just be serial execution, ergo blocking
[07:11] drach: do you want blocking or non-blocking?
[07:11] __tosh has joined the channel

[07:13] bickie: drach: no, waterfall is all non-blocking
[07:13] bickie: (well, the whole async lib is non-blocking, that's the point :))
[07:13] drach: then it creates transparently what I am advising you to create explicitly
[07:13] bickie: quite likely
[07:13] bickie: btw, the async lib is rather good indeed
[07:14] hwinkel has joined the channel
[07:15] drach: so if you like using magic, then use the async libs
[07:15] drach: if you like knowing what is going to be done next explicitly, use your own callbacks
[07:15] drach: one creates "cleaner looking" code, one creates "easier to trace and to debug" code
[07:15] drach: with less stacktrace
[07:16] drach: I've done it both ways. I always recommend the more maintainable and readable version
[07:16] bickie: drach: yeah, you might be right
[07:16] bickie: I just find something waaay too verbose to implement manually
[07:16] drach: haha, and yet I'm trying to write my own micro-framework
[07:16] drach: I don't mind verbose so long as it gets the job done
[07:16] bickie: like processing a queue of items in series, but with a parallel concurrency of N
[07:17] bickie: VERY painful to write by hand
[07:17] bickie: but async does it rather nicely :)

[07:51] mscdex: it might, but there's no way to really know unless it's tried
[07:51] mscdex: there is a python version requirement

[11:17] ASDF12341 has joined the channel

[11:18] galaxywatcher has joined the channel
[11:18] jesusabdullah: I guess you could do it that way, though I can't think of a time I used return just to kill iteration

[11:21] skoom has joined the channel
[11:21] jesusabdullah: It's true!
[11:21] Garo_: mscdex: yeah. I started to wonder if V8 might do some optimization in the later case
[11:21] quijote has joined the channel
[11:22] Garo_: because in "next(); return;" the V8 compiler could be smart enough to know that the return wont ever return anything and do tail recursion
[11:22] Garo_: but I have no idea if V8 actually does something like that

[11:22] saelfaer: hey, anyone here who knows something about npm? 
[11:23] saelfaer: having trouble getting it installed on one of my systems (vm) 
[11:23] Garo_: saelfaer: what kind of problem?
[11:23] saelfaer: the shell script hangs somewhere in the middle
[11:23] Garo_: saelfaer: https://github.com/isaacs/npm#readme
[11:23] Garo_: saelfaer: you need to pass clean=no or clean=yes to the sh
[11:23] saelfaer: no error... i did add some echo's in the middle to see where it gets
[11:23] saelfaer: its before the clean script
[11:23] Garo_: yeah, the new npm version asks if it should cleanup old installations
[11:24] saelfaer: i know but i don't have a previous install on that vm so it isnt related to that
[11:24] saelfaer: but thanks for the tip though
[11:24] Garo_: then I don't know, but I had just similar problem with the npm asking about cleanup
[11:24] saelfaer: :)
[11:24] kohai: @stevenmilne: some nice sketchbook to screen shortcuts in here http://blog.nodejitsu.com/single-page-apps-with-nodejs
[11:24] Garo_: the npm install asks about the cleanup even if there isn't any old installations
[11:24] kohai: @mediatemple: @KingScooty Due to shared and clustered architecture of (gs), install of node.js is not possible. Would require a (dv) or (ve) Server. ^SS
[11:24] daglees has joined the channel
[11:24] Garo_: so I just use "curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | clean=yes sh" in my VM installation scripts
[11:25] saelfaer: jep that i tried as well
[11:25] saelfaer: but it hangs somewhere when it tries to do something with node
[11:25] saelfaer: i don't have the script open atm, but i added loads of echo's to see what line it hangs on :)

[16:32] micheil: KucukMubasir: actually, push technology does work in IE
[16:32] micheil: however, you have to make use of a third party plugin like Flash
[16:32] KucukMubasir: micheil: as long polling?
[16:32] context: kucukmubasir: wrong.
[16:32] micheil: you can also resort to using things such as long polling
[16:33] kohai: @isamgray: @mikexcore Yes I do. Nothing publicly available yet, but I am working on a web app in Node.js for fun/learning. :)
[16:33] context: kucukmubasir: just about every 'push'/websocket library out there for node and others supports falling back to either comet or flash sockets
[16:33] brianseeders: the flash websocket emulation seems to work great
[16:33] micheil: We at pusher.com resort to using Flash for browsers that do not natively support WebSockets
[16:33] kohai: @rfc1437: Blogorum: Single Page Apps with Node.js. – blog.nodejitsu.com – scaling node.js applications one callback at a time. http://bit.ly/lQR0t1
[16:34] KucukMubasir: context: so I shouldn't bother ie incompatibilities in this case?
[16:34] micheil: the only gotcha with the flash websocket implementation is that it adds considerable page weight, and takes about twice to three times as long to initialise on page load 
[16:35] zivester has joined the channel
[16:35] micheil: KucukMubasir: also, just because you want to do realtime push, doesn't mean you need to run your own websocket server and your own node.js server.
[16:35] context: kucukmubasir: what?
[16:35] SubStack: KucukMubasir: with socket.io it just works™
[16:35] micheil: If you already have an application in another programming language, why throw yet another platform at it?
[16:35] context: kucukmubasir: im saying must libs out there support falling back to another technology so it will still work with pile of trash browsers liek IE
[16:35] SubStack: node doesn't have this baked in, it's handled by third-party libraries on npm
[16:35] micheil: SubStack: no, with Pusher.com, it just works™
[16:36] micheil: context: *ahem* firefox too doesn't support WebSockets.
[16:36] kohai: @ciupinet: Node.js help sheet http://goo.gl/RvPhI - for the JavaScript passionate
[16:36] micheil: (it's only just been announced today that firefox is re-enabling websockets support)
[16:36] context: kucukmubasir: and the socket.io website says it handles: websocket, flash socket, ajax polling, ajax multipart streaming, forever iframe, jsonp polling. i imagine IE can do at least one of them,
[16:36] SubStack: micheil: neat
[16:36] context: micheil: yeah firefox is garbage too
[16:37] brianseeders: IE does flash socket with socket.io
[16:37] brianseeders: as does Firefox
[16:37] micheil: context: that leaves you with only Safari, Opera or Chrome left
[16:37] KucukMubasir: firefox supports it micheil http://html5readiness.com/
[16:37] context: i <3 chrome. but have them all installed of course.
[16:37] kohai: @myikegami_bot: Node.JS Help Sheet http://goo.gl/fb/HpKCj
[16:37] micheil: KucukMubasir: No. I can assure you that firefox does not support WebSockets.
[16:38] context: they disabled it after that security vuln scare
[16:38] micheil: Firefox disabled websockets due to security concerns

[16:40] jetienne: KucukMubasir: hue ? where did you read that ?
[16:40] micheil: KucukMubasir: there are certain cases where you would like to host your own websocket server as compared with using something like Pusher.com
[16:40] KucukMubasir: "The following browsers originally supported WebSocket, but have since disabled the protocol by default. Chrome also plans to disable the WebSocket if actual exploit code appears before the protocol is revised"
[16:40] micheil: KucukMubasir: chrome is not going to be disabling websockets anytime soon.

[20:49] wookiehangover has joined the channel
[20:49] hucker: is it possible to have a node.js socket.io socket without also using node.js for webserving?
[20:50] hucker: I want to use socket.io with node, but serve everything else with django through apache
[20:50] Marak: hucker: you can use the client-side part without node.js, but you need a websocket server
[20:50] Marak: hucker: you might want to setup a reverse proxy?

[20:50] ako has joined the channel
[20:50] hucker: hmm
[20:50] Marak: hucker: have you seen http://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy ?
[20:51] chjj: dve: exports is a reference to module.exports, theyre the same object initially
[20:51] Marak: maybe you park that in front of everything and have it reverse proxy your websockets to socket.io and everything else to apache?
[20:51] hucker: will look at it now, thanks :)
[20:51] tdegrunt has joined the channel
[20:51] EyePulp: yo ho ho
[20:51] Marak: dve: I thin its the same?
[20:51] dve: chjj Marak so why have both?
[20:51] Marak: dve: I'm not 100% sure on that, but in my experience they have been pretty much the same 
[20:51] chjj: dve: but because of the way variables work in javascript, you could do exports = myfunc;
[20:51] chjj: couldnt*
[20:51] Marak: dve: no clue
[20:52] kohai: @tanepiper: Oh look, a #nodejs CMS: https://github.com/cliftonc/calipso - WHY OH WHY does it have to use MongoDB though :/
[20:52] chjj: dve: so you have to do module.exports = myfunc;
[20:52] dve: chjj so it node world it makes no difference
[20:52] wink_: holy hell the twitter bot sucks

[20:52] chjj: dve: it can make a difference

[20:53] chjj: dve: if you want to overwrite the entire object, youll have to set module.exports
[20:53] chjj: dve: other than that theres no difference really
[20:53] mikeal: now we spam our own channel with twitter :)
[20:53] jhurlima0: bah, i should stop talking to bots
[20:53] Marak: hucker: you arent going to get apache to proxy your websockets correctly
[20:53] dve: chjj when would you want overwrite the entire object?
[20:53] chjj: dve: they refer to the same object initially
[20:53] Marak: hucker: i mean maybe you could, if you are super leet
[20:53] galaxywatcher has joined the channel
[20:53] Marak: hucker: apache isnt well suited for long lived http requests

[20:54] txdv: Marak: after 5000 connections every apache server goes down
[20:54] txdv: :D
[20:54] Marak: hucker: i think the best approach would be to have node listening first. i suggest you post this issue to the node.js mailing list and see what people say
[20:54] dve: chjj but the overwrite would only be the context of that particalur module?
[20:54] Marak: hucker: you shouldnt believe everything you read on IRC :-)
[20:54] dve: in the*
[20:55] chjj: dve: what?
[20:55] hucker: heh, I'm probably not that leet since I'm asking.. but doesn't the client connect to node directly with js?

[20:55] dve: chjj sorry, to rephrase... if I have 3 node 'modules' and one of them does exports = ... what happens to the rest of the modules
[20:56] chjj: dve: module.exports and exports are initially the same object, but if you set `exports` directly, you will just lose the reference to `module.exports` rather than be actually setting a property on the `module` object
[20:56] hucker: I guess I don't really understand how socket.io works yet
