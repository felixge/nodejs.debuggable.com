[02:03] odie5533: Borgoluzzuo: I think we'd need to see the JSON response he is receiving.
[02:04] tjholowaychuk: arlolra nah should be fine, express doesn't emit anything custom so you only  have to worry about collisions with node's regular events

[03:00] qcom: is it possible to set an element's id attribute via interpolation in jade?
[03:00] tjholowaychuk: qcom just do mytag(id=whatever)

[03:01] qcom: indeed it does, thanks
[03:01] odie5533: tjholowaychuk: Is there a better method to look out for? Or is this the best way to access class variables from an event receiving function?
[03:01] tjholowaychuk: odie5533 well or you just do function(){ obj.foo() }
[03:01] tjholowaychuk: depends on how much work you are doing
[03:01] tjholowaychuk: that vs obj.foo.bind(obj)
[03:01] tjholowaychuk: but if you're doing other stuff do the closure

[03:17] chjj: hm, no idea, are you trying to build 0.5.4pre?
[03:17] clifton: yeah latest
[03:17] chjj: go with 0.4.10 if you want something stable

[04:19] ale: Oh but I won't know that!
[04:19] materialdesigner: ...

[05:08] Nuck: odie5533: Eh?  Express is 100% JavaScript, just FYI
[05:08] Nuck: It seemed like you might not have realized this.
[05:08] odie5533: I did not realize that.
[05:08] Nuck: Yeah, Node provides Filesystem functions.
[05:09] Nuck: Async FS calls.
[05:09] odie5533: A lot of the modules I looked at use C for some things.
[05:09] Nuck: Many do.
[05:09] Nuck: For intensive tasks on binary data, C will generally be faster.

[05:20] odie5533: I am. I need to hash many GB of data.
[05:20] jesusabdullah: v8 is optimised really well but has a pretty big overhead for invoking ffi action
[05:20] jesusabdullah: SO, in a lot of cases it's a wash, or even a win for js

[05:26] Nuck: jesusabdullah: What's worse, they had used DIVs when they first released v7
[05:26] mape: -ms -moz -o etc etc
[05:26] Nuck: Then, for some retarded reason, they devided to switch to tables.
[05:26] jesusabdullah: Nuck: Maybe they did it in a last ditch effort to support ie6?
[05:26] Nuck: jesusabdullah: lol
[05:26] jesusabdullah: They were doing it live i bet

[05:27] Nuck: But still
[05:27] jesusabdullah: pushing to production
[05:27] jesusabdullah: D:
[05:27] jesusabdullah: new goal: Do it live, don't fuck up
[05:27] Nuck: 1100 errors in the CSS on their main page alone?
[05:27] Nuck: That's what we got when we sent it through Unicorn.

[05:28] odie5533: crypto on windows doesn't even support crc32..
[05:28] jesusabdullah: node on windows is still beta yo
[05:28] Nuck: Does it support MD5?
[05:28] odie5533: yes
[05:28] jesusabdullah: I wouldn't even mess until v0.6
[05:29] odie5533: jesusabdullah: I am on windows. what would you propose?
[05:29] jesusabdullah: throw some linux on dat bitch clearly
[05:29] jesusabdullah: alternately, vm it up
[05:29] jesusabdullah: or cygwin
[05:29] Nuck: http://validator.w3.org/unicorn/check?ucn_uri=deviantart.com%2F&ucn_task=full-css&warning=no&usermedium=all
[05:29] Nuck: Yup
[05:29] Nuck: 1176 errors
[05:29] Nuck: So almost 1200
[05:29] jesusabdullah: that was what peeps did before 0.5
[05:29] odie5533: I didn't even know css had errors.
[05:29] materialdesigner: Nuck: I've seen the use of <i> for rounding, etc
[05:29] Nuck: Level 3: 1020
[05:30] materialdesigner: when they want to add hooks "without adding semantics"
[05:30] samba_ has joined the channel
[05:30] Nuck: odie5533: Apprently dA doesn't either.
[05:30] materialdesigner: since i and b are the smallest tags
[05:30] jesusabdullah: Well, every language has a sense of errors
[05:30] Nuck: materialdesigner: IT's sorta understandable, but that's not adding to the CSS errors.
[05:30] samba_: can we compile node x86_64?
[05:30] jesusabdullah: Why would <i> work for rounding?
[05:30] jesusabdullah: I don't understand :/
[05:30] jesusabdullah: samba_: afaik yes
[05:30] davidbanham: odie5533: Grab an AWS free tier server as a development environment.
[05:30] materialdesigner: the <i> doesn't make it rounded, but it gives you something to hook your CSS to
[05:30] jesusabdullah: ah
[05:30] materialdesigner: so you can do i { // do shit here to round it }
[05:30] jesusabdullah: ballsy
[05:31] jesusabdullah: I'd just use a span :/
[05:31] jesusabdullah: Does that make me weird?
[05:31] materialdesigner: yeah, a span is the appropriate semanticless element
[05:31] Nuck: jesusabdullah: They do three rows of <i> tags, position them on the top and bottom of the element, then resize them to make a pixelly rounding.
[05:31] materialdesigner: but people think i's don't have meaning, and they are 3 chars shorter than span
[05:31] Nuck: They also put another set of i tags in the i tags.
[05:31] jesusabdullah: isn't i for italic?
[05:31] jesusabdullah: italics are important!
[05:31] materialdesigner: which is presentational, and not semantic
[05:31] Nuck: jesusabdullah: It's <em> :P
[05:31] Nuck: lol
[05:31] jesusabdullah: wat
[05:31] jesusabdullah: are you sure?
[05:31] Nuck: <em> and <strong>
[05:31] jesusabdullah: wth is <i> then?
[05:32] odie5533: davidascher: I have a VPS to test my program on linux. But I want to develop on Windows.
[05:32] materialdesigner: it used to mean italics
[05:32] jesusabdullah: I know <b> emboldens
[05:32] Nuck: <i> is the OLD tag
[05:32] jesusabdullah: oh
[05:32] Nuck: <b> is ALSO an old tag
[05:32] jesusabdullah: whaat
[05:32] odie5533: davidbanham**
[05:32] jesusabdullah: why did they deprecate that shit
[05:32] Nuck: Both are deprecated in HTML5
[05:32] jesusabdullah: what a crock :C
[05:32] Nuck: jesusabdullah: They provide styles in HTML
[05:32] materialdesigner: they aren't deprecated, Nuck
[05:32] Nuck: Which is bad
[05:32] slajax has joined the channel
[05:32] materialdesigner: they have been rebranded

[05:32] catshirt has joined the channel
[05:32] jesusabdullah: oh
[05:32] jesusabdullah: well
[05:32] materialdesigner: i now means "alternative voice"
[05:32] jesusabdullah: it's silly anyway!
[05:32] Nuck: materialdesigner: They *were going to be* deprecated.
[05:33] materialdesigner: and b means something like "semantically offset" or some other nonsense
[05:33] jesusabdullah: I'm going to call tim berners-lee right now
[05:33] jesusabdullah: and tell him that whatwg is stupid
[05:33] jesusabdullah: and he'll be like, "dude I thought html1 was where it was at you don't have to tell me"
[05:33] materialdesigner: lol
[05:33] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Meh, I mostly use spans with classes anyways :P
[05:33] jesusabdullah: fuckin'
[05:34] Nuck: I rarely need to emphasize text (since I do the layouts and not the content)
[05:34] jesusabdullah: This is why I do latex
[05:34] jesusabdullah: obtw I heard you can use javascript in pdf's
[05:34] Nuck: Fuck LaTeX, use MArkdown.
[05:34] jesusabdullah: tssch
[05:34] jesusabdullah: I rock both motherfucker
[05:34] jesusabdullah: Markdown is lightweight, but it's also lightweight.
[05:34] jesusabdullah: Dig?
[05:34] Nuck: *word* --> <i>word</i>
[05:34] Nuck: And **word** --> <b>word</b>
[05:34] Nuck: Or in newer implementations, <em> and <strong>
[05:34] jesusabdullah: hah
[05:35] jesusabdullah: I love markdown, but for typesetting and equations latex can't be beat atm
[05:35] Nuck: (because i and b are still frowned-upon from when they were slated to be removed in HTML5)
[05:35] materialdesigner: I wish we used latex more often
[05:35] jesusabdullah: I wrote https://github.com/jesusabdullah/anisotropy using latex
[05:35] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Markdown for math would be AWFUL D:

[05:36] materialdesigner: except <script> now defaults to javascript
[05:36] jesusabdullah: right, hence the type right?
[05:36] Nuck: should be text/latex
[05:37] materialdesigner: ACTION is looking up the spec
[05:37] jesusabdullah: I thought text/ was deprecated :(
[05:37] jesusabdullah: I hate how that shit's so fucking wordy

[05:37] jesusabdullah: do they really think I'm gonna be like <script type="binary/latex"> ?
[05:37] jesusabdullah: gohl
[05:37] jesusabdullah: I hate html SO much
[05:37] chjj: text/ is deprecated for text/javascript, because it introduced encoding ambiguity
[05:37] Nuck: jesusabdullah: That's a mime type
[05:37] chjj: same thing with text/xml
[05:37] Nuck: But it'd be application/latex, not binary/latex
[05:38] jesusabdullah: mime types are stupid :C
[05:38] jesusabdullah: I don't actually mean that. I just don't like how verbose "proper" html is
[05:38] jesusabdullah: I'd rather be able to cut corners and have sensible defaults
[05:38] Nuck: jesusabdullah: In PROPER HTML, you can leave off angle brackets
[05:38] jesusabdullah: wat
[05:38] chjj: jesusabdullah: the point of specifying text/ was originally to have ascii as a fallback encoding
[05:38] Nuck: I could do <b this is a test/
[05:38] jesusabdullah: o___o
[05:38] Nuck: and odd shit like that
[05:38] Nuck: Yeah
[05:38] chjj: which is what the text/ is for
[05:39] Nuck: chjj: FUCK ASCII! UTF-8 4 LIFE
[05:39] jesusabdullah: I'm still disappoint
[05:39] Nuck: ACTION <3 Unicode
[05:39] chjj: nuck: why do you think its becomming deprecated now?
[05:39] chjj: now that utf8 is ubiquitous

[05:40] xerox: jesusabdullah: http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/preview.html ?
[05:40] chjj: because thats not where to specify an encoding
[05:40] Nuck: chjj: IT should be :P
[05:40] Nuck: lol
[05:40] skm has joined the channel
[05:40] chjj: you do application/javascript because it may be one of many encodings

[05:41] jesusabdullah: and lightweight uses of latex
[05:42] chjj: doing text/ introduces ambiguity, especially with text/xml, in the processing instruction you set an encoding, same thing with the charset directive, and then you have the text/ prefix
[05:42] chjj: 3 ways to do it
[05:42] chjj: the user agent wont know what the hell to pick
[05:43] blaenk: has this been discussed: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2848239

[05:59] deadman87: I have a question: How much RAM is recommended on a VPS hosting a simple node app? i.e. node + socket.io with a few static pages.
[06:00] slickplaid: deadman87: 2048 gigaquads
[06:00] deadman87: lol
[06:01] deadman87: I am looking for a cheapie VPS to host my test app... but donno what will be sufficient. VPS hosts dont know what is node.js *facepalm*
[06:01] clifton: ec2 micro instances are free
[06:01] clifton: i set one up with node running very quickly
[06:01] deadman87: but need a credit card.. which I do not have
[06:01] odie5533: you get 1 year free
[06:01] deadman87: debit cards dont work 
[06:02] odie5533: they arent free forever
[06:02] deadman87: also if u go over ur limit, they take the money off ur cc
[06:02] deadman87: without asking.. or so I heard
[06:02] clifton: yeah sounds right
[06:02] clifton: our CFO comes at me with our AWS bill every month
[06:02] clifton: ive had a slicehost account for a while
[06:03] clifton: 20$ / month
[06:03] clifton: for a personal account last few years
[06:04] deadman87: i'm looking at AlienVPS.. for $19/year they have similar account like slicehost
[06:05] deadman87: more diskspace, more bandwidth, ram is a little less though
[06:05] deadman87: I been scouting webhostingtalk for some reviews on cheap hosts
[06:05] blkcat: you get what you pay for
[06:05] odie5533: deadman87: their website has no name or address on it. good luck.
[06:05] blkcat: clifton: i'd drop slicehost if i were you
[06:05] blkcat: clifton: check out linode or chunkhost, vastly more competitive and great service
[06:06] deadman87: mmm
[06:06] yozgrahame has joined the channel

[06:07] odie5533: blkcat: find me a xen for $23/year.
[06:07] deadman87: whats the difference between openvz, xen and kvm? I mean when it comes to running node apps
[06:08] odie5533: OpenVZ get oversold a lot and can run slow.
[06:08] odie5533: All of them run node apps.
[06:08] deadman87: I see
[06:08] jesusabdullah: I'm using linode right now for vps action
[06:08] blkcat: prgmr.com is probably the cheapest good vps you're going to find
[06:08] jesusabdullah: I like it! though, it's probably OP
[06:08] odie5533: anyways, eNetSouth is pretty good so I'd say go with them
[06:09] jesusabdullah: prgmr looked like a lot of effort to me
[06:09] deadman87: I dont see the yearly plan at eNetSouth
[06:09] blkcat: or just get a free no.de beta system
[06:09] blkcat: which won't suck
[06:09] jesusabdullah: linode is stupid easy to get going with, and they've been really nice to me!
[06:09] blkcat: jesusabdullah: linode <3
[06:09] jesusabdullah: In a month or two nodejitsu should be goin' too

[06:09] jesusabdullah: if you can get in on their public beta, I recommend.
[06:10] jesusabdullah: disclaimer: I work there
[06:10] odie5533: jesusabdullah: can we get cutsies?
[06:10] slickplaid: anyone try rackspace before with node?
[06:12] deadman87: +1 odie5533
[06:12] odie5533: jesusabdullah: is no.de beta or something?
[06:13] jesusabdullah: I actually don't know re: no.de
[06:13] jesusabdullah: and no, I don't think cutsies are in your future.
[06:13] jesusabdullah: ;)
[06:13] jesusabdullah: PATIENCE
[06:13] jesusabdullah: Or, switch later---either way
[06:14] odie5533: What will it offer?
[06:14] slickplaid: cloudfoundry (vmware) is also doing node instances

[06:15] odie5533: what's the difference between a node instance and a regular instance?

[06:20] deadman87: whats their policy on African users? how do they check for fraud? lol
[06:20] jesusabdullah: odie5533: not sure exactly

[06:21] jesusabdullah: hopefully in time for nko
[06:21] odie5533: BuyVM has a $3.50/mo plan, or Just295 has a $3/mo plan if you prefer monthly. but $23 is not much for a year considering you pay that for a month of linode
[06:21] deadman87: yeah
[06:21] deadman87: and I was gonna shell out $19 anyway on that no-name host
[06:22] deadman87: so rather pay little extra and go with some good host

[06:27] jesusabdullah: make no mistake
[06:27] odie5533: I definitely agree. But linode is overkill for what traffic/development I do.
[06:27] odie5533: deadman87: you mentioned about buying a better host when you get big websites. LEB runs on an 80MB VPS.
[06:28] deadman87: lol srsly?
[06:28] odie5533: yep.
[06:28] jesusabdullah: Yeah, it's overkill for me too, as a host
[06:28] jesusabdullah: but man I love having a remote shell
[06:28] deadman87: then the 160 should be more than enough for me :)
[06:28] jesusabdullah: it's worth that much to me

[06:29] deadman87: im a total newb to VPS though.. Can I PM u for some assistance odie5533?
[06:30] deadman87: davidbanham: No credit card for AWS :(
[06:30] davidbanham: deadman87: Ah, bugger :( Maybe take the $20 you were going to drop on Linode and buy a prepaid Visa on eBay or something?
[06:31] jesusabdullah: Yeah, I know :(
[06:31] jesusabdullah: In my defense, at the time I was sharing with my girlfriend
[06:31] jesusabdullah: we broke up shortly afterwards

[06:32] jesusabdullah: at which point I unceremoniously booted her off my server. I HAD THE POWER >:O

[06:37] davidbanham: deadman87: All the US prepaid credit card providers seem to want a social security number, which I imagine would be hard to spoof.
[06:37] odie5533: deadman87: only after we send the initial $2000 to cover the taxes
[06:37] davidbanham: deadman87: Here in Australia, though, the requirements seem easier. https://www.mycanvascard.com.au/Secure/OnlineMyDetails.aspx
[06:37] deadman87: odie5533: I will appoint u to be the middleman who gets 10% of my billion dollar wealth.. u can recover ur $2000 from there
[06:37] davidbanham: deadman87: The only challenge is getting it sent to you, as there isn't a mail forwarding ecosystem in Australia like there is in the US.
[06:38] davidbanham: I'm sure there'll be other countries that will be easier, though. Somewhere in the EU surely.

[06:52] davidbanham: odie5533: Yeah I've got no experience with them, just grabbed something cheap off Google.

[08:59] chjj: what coffeescript should do

[08:59] chjj: and change the parser
[08:59] chjj: then it would be better

[09:02] TheJH: odie5533, other values work, too
[09:02] chjj: how could a human being produce such a thing even
[09:02] odie5533: what is the standard?
[09:02] TheJH: odie5533, the standard is two
[09:03] odie5533: the linux kernel uses 8 spaces for tabs.

[09:03] TheJH: I added some optimizations to uglifyjs the last days, and they use 8 spaces :(
[09:04] chjj: yeah im okay with 4 space tabs, but i prefer 2 spaces
[09:04] odie5533: I will write a language that uses 1 space. It will compile to 2-spaced coffeescript, and then you can compile that to 4-spaced javascript, and then interpret it using an 8-spaced C-program.

[09:28] jhbot: Issue: #1029: Few fails in tests ;)
[09:29] TheJH: !issue search writable Broken pipe
[09:29] jhbot: no issues found
[09:29] Marak: i didnt find any
[09:30] TheJH: the only other cause I could imagine is someone doing sock.writable=true... but who would do that?
[09:31] Marak: TheJH: so what can we do to fix this?
[09:32] TheJH: Marak, in order to find the issue, maybe monkeypatch a trap into net.js that prints the stack every time "writable" gets modified? overwrite "writable" with a getter and a setter
[09:33] TheJH: or something like that
[09:33] robi42 has joined the channel
[09:34] TheJH: and then do "try{throw new Error('writable modified: '+newValue);}catch(e){console.log(e.stack);}" or so
[09:34] industrial: I have a problem with $ forever myapp.js
[09:34] industrial: it keeps restarting when it fails.
[09:34] Marak: industrial: lol
[09:34] industrial: No I'm serious, can I get it to stop at one error, then reload when I save a file again?
[09:35] industrial: I'm using this for development
[09:35] industrial: ofcourse it won't be failing in production
[09:35] Marak: industrial: may i offer a suggestion?
[09:35] industrial: yes
[09:35] Marak: industrial: i would not use forever like that, please.
[09:35] TheJH: :D
[09:36] industrial: Marak: well it reloads the app when I save a file, keeps me from ctrl-c, arrow up enter on every change
[09:36] Marak: industrial: i believe you might find solace in other tools which are designed for this https://github.com/isaacs/node-supervisor
[09:37] industrial: Actually I was using supervisor before, but I can't get that to do what I want either :)
[09:37] Marak: industrial: may i offer another suggestion?
[09:38] industrial: Marak: just do it?
[09:38] Marak: industrial: if you cannot get tools by indexzero and isaacs to "do what you want", perhaps you need to reevaluate what it is you are trying to do. 
[09:38] hlindset has joined the channel
[09:39] Marak: or just man up and write your own tool
[09:40] industrial: Marak: you are defending pieces of software as if I'm attacking them and their creators and I'm an unintelligent person for making application errors during development
[09:40] Marak: industrial: yes
[09:40] FireFly|n900: Watch a file for changes, kill proc and restart if it occurs.. doesn't sound all *that* hard to me
[09:41] industrial: Marak: well, I'm not attacking anyone. I'm just looking for a solution.
[09:41] Marak: solution to what problem
[09:41] TheJH: Marak, dnode messes with "writable" in two places

[11:04] TheJH: metaverse, could you gist your code?
[11:04] metaverse: yes, thanks
[11:05] odie5533: metaverse: yes, you can write twice. The problem is using TCP sockets, it will probably fragment into two packets
[11:05] odie5533: if you want to make it more likely to be one packet then you need to buffer the data before sending and perform only one write.
[11:06] TheJH: metaverse, you shouldn't use raw tcp write/read, use some wrapper module
[11:06] odie5533: metaverse: Are you just performing an operation when the TCP socket receives data?
[11:06] metaverse: I'm using the callback provided by write to make the second write. 
[11:07] odie5533: metaverse: just writing, no receiving?
[11:07] metaverse: wrapping up a gist..
[11:09] metaverse: hmm, I'm actually writing on the receive callback. First time works but not the second one

[11:49] tokumine: TheJH: I'm thinking of an scenario where incoming requests to server1 are sent to a job queue for processing on server2. When the job is finished the worker on server2 sends the data back to server1 over HTTP with a res identifier. server1 then basically finds the users res and proxies the data back to the user. I'm avoiding sending the data back to server1 via the job queue if possible to minimise moving parts.
[11:50] tokumine: I've not really found many good examples of this however. Aside, perhaps, from looking at the internals of node-http-proxy.
[11:51] TheJH: tokumine, "var id=uuid(); callbacks[id] = ...; doJob(id, otherData, ...);"?
[11:51] metaverse: TheJH: Ok honestly I don't know if it's string or binary. I don't think JSON.stringify fits my case. I'm experimenting writing a proxy server in node.js to learn about socket programming. The "unknown data" block is a tcp message I get from another socket. It might be an http request, a skype voip packet, a game communicating with it's server etc. Maybe I should do some research on how ssh does it's packet wrapping? Do you have an
[11:51] metaverse: ideas?
[11:51] TheJH: metaverse, send a JSON message that says "next thing is n bytes of raw data"?
[11:52] metaverse: TheJH: Perfect.

[11:53] tokumine: TheJH: yeah - I was thinking along those lines but it seemed a little brittle. But I'll give it a shot. Thanks for the uuid() tip!

[11:54] saschagehlich: is there a way to set a content type in res.render() in expressjs?
[11:54] tokumine: TheJH: yup, cheers. I guess the proxying server will just have to be a single process. Will give it a shot.

Coffeescript will very likely compile to cleaner/better JS than many teams will produce, so (ideally) many javascript issues go away…imho.

[13:23] hydrozen: Is it realistic to have a node application keep a socket connection opened to another application 24/7?
[13:24] TheJH: hydrozen, as long as you regularily send keepalive messages, it should work
[13:24] wink_: hydrozen: sure
[13:24] TheJH: hydrozen, if you don't send any data for a day or so, many firewalls will kill your connection

[13:55] tjholowaychuk: metamind:  "body" is a local populated by the rendered html of whatever was passed to res.render()
[13:55] jbrokc: yeah, i have no idea how to do the equivalent of ruby's gsub method.
[13:55] tjholowaychuk: and since it's html you want to buffer it unescaped
[13:55] tjholowaychuk: body\n  #content!= body
[13:56] tjholowaychuk: or similar
[13:56] tjholowaychuk: jbrokc i dont recall exactly what it does but .replace(/foo/g, 'bar') ?
[13:56] jbrokc: tjholowaychuk: ah, i'll try that. thanks! how about my going abouts of reading and writing - is that how it works for node and it's buffers?
[13:57] tjholowaychuk: that's on a string
[13:57] jbrokc: or do i have to take the buffer from the readFileSync and change it to a string?
[13:57] jbrokc: thought so.. and does writeFileSync replace it's contents?
[13:57] tjholowaychuk: fs.readFile(path, 'utf8', callback)
[13:58] jbrokc: tjholowaychuk: cool beans. thanks
[13:59] TheJH: jbrokc, readFileSync(name, encoding) gives you a string
[14:00] jbrokc: what's the difference / reason to use fs.read and fs.readFile ? 
[14:00] jbrokc: is read for streams of data?
[14:01] TheJH: jbrokc, read is streaming, readFile is "load the whole thing in RAM and give it to me"
[14:02] jbrokc: TheJH: thanks. i was looking at read before readFile and got pretty confused. don't know why I typed readFileSync even though I was trying readSync at the time...

[14:42] BillyBreen has joined the channel
[14:43] hydrozen: stagas: yeah I looked into it already. socket.io is for websockets though right? it's when you want a socket opened between node and a browser?
[14:43] hydrozen: node between 2 node apps for example

[14:43] CIA-65: node: Fixes #1424. - http://bit.ly/oghxz4
[14:43] stagas: hydrozen: I think you can use it between 2 node apps also
[14:43] brainproxy: hydrozen: socket.io gives you a socket-like abstraction for node and/or browsers
[14:44] tomtomaso has joined the channel
[14:44] Cromulent has joined the channel
[14:44] brainproxy: it may use websockets, but for those platforms which don't support websocket, it can fall back to long-polling
[14:44] brainproxy: but the transport layer implementation isn't something the socket.io user has to worry about
[14:45] brainproxy: it's "under the hood" and behaves the same whatever transport is negotiated between the client and server
[14:45] hydrozen: i dunno, i tried opening a connexion between Flash and socket.io… and it never worked
[14:45] davidascher has joined the channel
[14:45] hydrozen: so I thought it was higher level or something
[14:45] brainproxy: hydrozen: flash sockets are the least preferrable fallback

[14:46] random123: Is there an elegant solution to Routing where you don't have them all in 1 file? I'm looking at Express and Sammy but that kind of bothers me, would it be possible to spread routes up across files?
[14:46] brainproxy: hopefully the client and server will first try websocket, then xhr, then ...
[14:46] tjholowaychuk: random123 they dont have to be in one file lol
[14:46] hydrozen: but for example you think I could use socket.io to open a socket to a Python application?
[14:46] tjholowaychuk: its just a method call, you can do that whereever you want
[14:46] matyr has joined the channel
[14:46] brainproxy: hydrozen: the python side would have to support the socket.io framework
[14:46] n33uby: i cannot install packages with npm. Anyone could help me?
[14:46] brainproxy: not sure if there is a socket.io implementation for python
[14:47] davidsklar: Do others also see "Internal routing error" when attempting to connect to http://search.npmjs.org/ ?
[14:47] hydrozen: yeah ok so that's what I meant. socket.io is like its own little implementation of websockets
[14:47] wenbert has joined the channel
[14:47] hydrozen: on top of regular sockets
[14:47] davidsklar: And also at  http://registry.npmjs.org/-/all — which affects npm operations
[14:47] willwhite has joined the channel
[14:47] brainproxy: hydrozen: it provides a more generic notion of a socket, yes
[14:47] brainproxy: which may use an actual websocket behind the scenes
[14:47] brainproxy: or may use another transport, just depending on the client
[14:48] TheJH: davidsklar, I'm affected, too
[14:48] tbassetto has joined the channel
[14:48] TheJH: isaacs isn't online :(
[14:48] n33uby: @davidsklar then that's the reason npm fails
[14:48] boaz has joined the channel
[14:49] davidsklar: ok, glad to know it's not just me :) 
[14:49] stagas: hydrozen: socket.io uses a little protocol over its transports, which requires you to write a specific client to connect to it from other languages/frameworks
[14:49] brainproxy: davidsklar: yah, the npm registry server thing seems to be down
[14:50] stagas: hydrozen: but you can use a simple websocket server if you don't care about other transports
[14:50] random123: tjholowaychuk: You wouldn't spread them across using "require" would you? Inside the scope of require its like a whole new scope?
[14:50] hydrozen: socket.io brings a lot of good stuff for node talking to multiple clients on the server. But I think for the communication between the two servers a regular socket might be enough
[14:50] hydrozen: its just little messages back and forth, nothing crazy
[14:51] tjholowaychuk: random123: there are at least 6 or 7 ways to do it
[14:51] n33uby: I'll return next days
[14:51] n33uby has left the channel
[14:51] tjholowaychuk: which is why express is not opinionated in that matter, you can do whatever you want
[14:51] random123: tjholowaychuk: Which way would you do it? Is this written somewhere?
[14:52] tjholowaychuk: random123 look at the examples in the repo
[14:52] random123: tjholowaychuk: ok
[14:52] tjholowaychuk: some readdir and auto-load, some do rails-style stuff etc
[14:52] stagas: hydrozen: yeah, the websocket though will abstract the negotiating stuff, handle connected clients and makes sure that messages arrive as a whole
[14:52] pt_tr has joined the channel
[14:53] stagas: hydrozen: where in a plain tcp connection you might get two or more messages as one, or half a message

[14:57] brianc: killer
[14:57] hydrozen: Whats dnode?

[15:21] rgabo: stick around and wait I guess
[15:21] Aiden: yep, that is the error I am seeing in the logs :) Explains a lot. Glad I didn't rip my file apart and start again, just incase it was my fault :S
[15:22] rgabo: yeah, same here
[15:22] rgabo: --verbose is helpful in these cases
[15:22] Aiden: Is there a way that I can make npm interact with my package.json file, in the way that Heroku does?
[15:23] Aiden: so that I can test it locally
[15:23] rgabo: i don't think Heroku does any magic with it, if you want to look at how dependencies, etc are handled
[15:23] rgabo: then either `npm install` or `npm link`
[15:23] rgabo: and `npm ls` give you an overview of how your package looks like

[18:21] context: whats it return
[18:22] Anton_: i don't know, node docs doesn't like to tell about returning values
[18:22] chjj: it returns a process object, no i dont think it is blocking, it would defeat the point of all the evented stuff afterward
[18:22] context: yeah node docs are bad at that :(
[18:22] hydrozen: if i got a socket opened, how can I send data to it every x seconds? I'm trying to use setTimeout but it seems to call my function only once..
[18:22] context: anton_: fork() in C returns the child PID. id assume spawn() is at least going to block until it can return a pid

[18:32] chjj: hmm looks like it might be blocking actually?

[18:34] chjj: well, im looking at the uv version
[18:34] context: if fork returns pid, the process has staretd.
[18:34] context: but i dont know how ipc works and if the child doesn't have an event handler setup yet
[18:34] context: does it sit in a queue or disappear
[18:35] context: im guessing send() is using some weird ipc or node internal ipc?

[18:40] pspeter3: What is the syntax to pass in a variable to a module and have the module export a set of methods?
[18:40] chjj: to pass a variable to a module you require?
[18:40] context: chjj: any easy way to find like object definitions in node stdlib, are all methods in lib/ or any easy way to see method list in src/ for native methods
[18:41] chjj: some stuff is defined in c land, some is in js land, some is just wrapped in js land
[18:42] pspeter3: chjj: I want to create a static class that uses the same object around it
[18:42] context: kk so there is no like struct for each type that lists all of them though
[18:42] context: or even a single place for each object where all methods are registered with v8 or something like that
[18:43] chjj: pspeter3: if you want to pass a variable *to* a module, the simplest way is, require('./module')(foo), and have that module expose `module.exports = function(foo) { ... }` and return an object

[19:30] Nuck: Not if you scale it right ;)

[19:30] pixel13 has joined the channel
[19:30] Nuck: Not as much as Couch, that's for sure.
[19:30] tjholowaychuk: which is 0 for redis

[19:30] Nuck: Mongo is a full-on database system

[19:32] japj: well, unless we know what exactly caused the issues with the npm registry. who can tell if something similar could have happened with mongo
[19:32] Nuck: isaacs: what jesusabdullah said :P
[19:32] jesusabdullah: pffsht
[19:32] isaacs: Nuck: i think jesusabdullah was making fun of you
[19:32] jesusabdullah: I have a feeling their stabilities are on par homie
[19:32] isaacs: i measure stability in data loss.
[19:32] Nuck: isaacs: I know, I'm joking.
[19:32] isaacs: couch wins.
[19:32] jesusabdullah: I *have* heard that mongo is web scale, though.
[19:32] Nuck: isaacs: Well, if Mongo is set up for scalability and redundancy, you'll be fine ;)
[19:32] jesusabdullah: isaacs: Is couch web scale?
[19:33] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Very good question.
[19:33] isaacs: we've beat the hell out of the npm registry, and so far, data loss has not been a problem.
[19:33] oliland: everything is roflscale
[19:33] Nuck: I know Mongo is webscale though.
[19:33] mjr_: I've found CouchDB to be astoundingly stable.  It's just way too slow for large databases.
[19:33] japj: what *is* webscale?
[19:33] kristsk: yeah, what is ?
[19:33] jesusabdullah: Does /dev/null support sharding?
[19:33] kristsk: like facebook size or somth?

[19:35] tjholowaychuk: mjr_ just crashing a lot, our prod setup is fine we have redundancy but locally it crashes pretty often for me
[19:35] mjr_: yikes
[19:35] tjholowaychuk: which I just found annoying because people make fun of redis for being "unstable" yet I've never had an issue once
[19:35] tjholowaychuk: and people forget you can configure these things
[19:35] tjholowaychuk: haha
[19:35] jacobolus has joined the channel
[19:35] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: Hmmm I've never crashed my local mongos
[19:35] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: "unstable" is the worst empty annoying comment to say about software.
[19:36] mjr_: redis is "unstable" only because it doesn't actually try to save your data very often.  But it's very honest about this shortcoming.
[19:36] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: everything's "unstable".  i turned off the server, and it just died.
[19:36] isaacs: that's so unstable!
[19:36] tjholowaychuk: mjr_ yeah plus you can configure that
[19:36] tjholowaychuk: hahaha
[19:36] Nuck: isaacs: There is a certain point where "unstable" is a damn good description.  Like deviantART chats.  They break from so much as a load balancer failing over on another site.
[19:36] isaacs: express: unstable, because it cannot survive turning off the power to themachine.
[19:36] mjr_: Thankfully, everything these days is also very lightweight.
[19:36] mjr_: You know, thing wrappers.
[19:36] mjr_: Oh, and easy to use.
[19:37] japj: isaacs: btw, nice dirt'y talk you gave recently ;)
[19:37] bradleymeck: isaacs: it doesn't work on windows === unstable / unusable / ugly / random slur / inefficient / insecure / ... (it all goes back to comfort)
[19:37] Nuck: isaacs: Express can survive anything but that though, I think.
[19:37] Nuck: bradleymeck: But can it run Crysis?
[19:37] tjholowaychuk: even with the power off!
[19:37] isaacs: japj: thanis
[19:37] Nuck: Anyways, so when this guy is done learning Node + Mongo + Express (my company's web stack), he wants me to test him.
[19:37] isaacs: *thanks
[19:37] Nuck: Any ideas of tests for him?
[19:38] skampler: using redis in conjunction with more persistent storage makes a lot of sense
[19:38] Nuck: Does memcached work for Mongo?
[19:38] Nuck: >_>
[19:38] japj: what happens if you stomp his feet? (or you don't mean test *him*?)

[19:41] Nuck: I'm on Mongo since I always dreamt of queryable JSON
[19:41] jesusabdullah: Speaking of daterbases: I'm thinking about writing a thing where you post timestamped data and then pull it back out
[19:41] pspeter3: oliland: Maybe it's regional. I've always heard people using mongo over couch
[19:41] jetienne_ has joined the channel
[19:41] jesusabdullah: would mongo or couch be a better fit?
[19:41] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Sounds like redis.
[19:41] Nuck: timestamp = key, data = value
[19:41] Nuck: key value store
[19:41] oliland: mongo has a better ruby driver thats for sure
[19:42] Nuck: Mongo has a good Node driver too
[19:42] Nuck: And since it's JSON, it feels fucking great.
[19:42] bradleymeck: Nuck, 1. install some modules / use one (doesnt really matter which) 2. explain how event emitters actually work / why you may want to process.nextTick during sync events. 3. Explain how they deal with complex procedures that typically incur nesting if you just put it all together

[20:48] Sazpaimon: at least on OBSD
[20:48] bnoordhuis: Sazpaimon: what version of gcc?

[20:51] bnoordhuis: 4.4.x and 4.5.x are all known-good
[20:51] Sazpaimon: bnoordhuis, I wouldn't doubt it, but i dont think openbsd has a package for gcc 4.4, I may have to compile it
[20:51] Sazpaimon: the only warnings im getting is warnings with sprintf
[20:51] bnoordhuis: Sazpaimon: you can strip out the -Werrors from deps/v8/SConscript
[20:51] Sazpaimon: such as "deoptimizer.cc:620: warning: format '%08x' expects type 'unsigned int', but argument 2 has type 'long unsigned int'"
[20:51] Sazpaimon: yeah I already did that
[20:52] bnoordhuis: ^ that's a legitimate complaint though
[20:52] bnoordhuis: it'll probably do the wrong thing on big-endian 64 bit systems
[20:54] Sazpaimon: bnoordhuis, this is a 32 bit system
[20:55] bnoordhuis: Sazpaimon: then you're in the clear: sizeof(unsigned) == sizeof(unsigned long)

[21:49] mjr_: KristjanS: your issue is basically the same as markdaws'.  The node APIs are mostly async, on purpose, which can mean a pretty big mental shift if you aren't used to writing code like that.
[21:49] mjr_: If you are used to browser programming, pretend that all I/O you want to do is on the other end of an XHR, and then you'll be in the right mindset.

[21:58] ismell: hrmm my npm is broke
[21:58] isaacs: CrabDude: where would the "integration" go?
[21:58] isaacs: CrabDude: you are asking for a github commit hook, not an npm plugin
[22:00] CrabDude: isaacs: Well, I guess I'm imagining an automatic github commit hook for npmjs.org if repository.autoPublish=true (and url is github)
[22:00] bksf: question and maybe this sounds silly. why does the mongo db module work like this: var mongodb = require("node-mongodb-native/lib/mongodb"); vs. the other modules i've worked with so far var module = require("modue");
[22:01] bbrandon has joined the channel
[22:01] isaacs: CrabDude: there is a github commit plugin thingie already that publishes whenever you push a tag that is a semver.

[22:26] isaacs: CrabDude: well, yeah, but you still have to add the hook to your github repo to ping the cpr server somehow
[22:26] isaacs: CrabDude: the difference is that he's using a git-aware registry, whereas i'm using a couchdb.

[22:34] perezd: yeah, I guess so

[22:39] bnoordhuis: chjj: probably yes
[22:39] perezd: can't say you are taking on erlang without features like that.
[22:39] bnoordhuis: perezd: we haven't reach 1.0 yet
[22:40] bnoordhuis: *reached
[22:40] perezd: bnoordhuis: I was referring to hook.io
[22:40] perezd: not nodejs
[22:40] bnoordhuis: right, carry on
[22:40] perezd: my personal opinion: nodejs will do well to add these features, as part of nodejs.
[22:40] tjholowaychuk: perezd maybe we should hack on something to play around with ideas
[22:40] perezd: tjholowaychuk: yeah, totally true...but I guess I want to see it be focused more in depth than breadth

[22:41] isaacs: perezd: yessir.
[22:41] isaacs: perezd: i would like to take over erlang's niche.
[22:42] perezd: erlang gets so many things right
[22:42] isaacs: i mean, not the academic functional programming with weird pattern-matching syntax niche.
[22:42] perezd: and a lot of things wrong
[22:42] chjj: i thought most people programmed in an armchair anyway
[22:42] isaacs: but the distributed fault-tolerant niche
[22:42] perezd: isaacs: yes
[22:42] tjholowaychuk: awesome pattern matching
[22:42] perezd: I think the concurrency model of erlang will always lean towards slightly more performant
[22:42] perezd: as long as node intends to rely on OS processes
[22:42] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: yeah, pattern-matching in js would be so fucking hawt.
[22:42] fille: no one have problem with npm install forever?
[22:43] fille: for debian
[22:43] isaacs: switch (obj) { case {foo: true, _}: ... }
[22:43] tjholowaychuk: isaacs sure would be !
[22:43] isaacs: ACTION swoon
[22:43] tjholowaychuk: perezd you could use isolates etc blah blah
[22:43] isaacs: fille: npm install forever works for me.  gist the npm-debug.log file if it fails.
[22:43] perezd: tjholowaychuk: yeah, I am excited to see what comes out of the next 6 mo of nodejs hacking
[22:44] fille: gist not founc isaacs
[22:44] isaacs: fille: i mean, go to http://gist.github.com/ and paste the npm-debug.log file in there.
[22:45] fille: aa greate
[22:45] isaacs: fille:  or use the gist command-line client, which you have to install first (and it's awesome, highly recommend)

[22:48] Eber___ has joined the channel
[22:48] perezd: that I want to see more focus on, when talking IPC for nodejs
[22:48] perezd: they totally abstract the networkign away 
[22:48] perezd: so IPC on the same VM/Box/Network/Data center is the same.
[22:48] chjj: yeah thats what i always hear is erlangs selling point
[22:49] perezd: chjj: check this out: this is my fave screenshot example of erlang http://i.imgur.com/K0brb.jpg
[22:49] perezd: those are two unrelated shells, communicating and sharing module communication

[22:51] Eber: check*
[22:51] perezd: chjj, yeah, its pretty impressive shit.
[22:51] perezd: they have about 30 years head start on the problem :)
[22:52] chjj: isaacs: is there anyway to just have an npm publish point to a git repo?
[22:52] chjj: so npm install x would just git clone behind the scenes
[22:53] chjj: been wondering about that for a while
[22:53] isaacs: chjj: no, not yet.  there's an open issue.  you can do this, though:  { "dependencies": { "foo" : "http://url.com/to/tarball.tgz" } }
[22:53] isaacs: chjj: so if the git repo is github, you can do http://github.com/usre/project/tarball/commitish
[22:53] mekazu has joined the channel

[22:54] isaacs: chjj: or git+http://...
[22:54] chjj: yeah thatd be awesome
[22:54] chjj: i might look into that
[22:54] isaacs: chjj: won't be for a while, though
[22:54] Eber: isaacs: what does these characters "âââ¬ c" mean when I give a `npm ls`?
[22:54] isaacs: chjj: for now, just use the tarball url.
[22:54] isaacs: Eber: it means that you're not using a terminal font with unicode support
[22:54] chjj: i just want to simplify things for myself so i dont always have to keep track of how often im doing npm publishes
[22:55] isaacs: Eber: there's no way to swap out those chars for now, but if you wanna post an issue, that'd be cool
[22:55] Eber: isaacs: but do they have a meaning? or should something else display where it shows up?
[22:55] isaacs: Eber: they're supposed to be lines, like a tree

[23:04] Eber: isaacs: when you say it will add to my package.json you mean if I'm building a distributable package?

[23:05] isaacs: Eber: it's also just convenient.
[23:05] isaacs: Eber: `npm init` will get you started.
[23:05] AvianFlu: it's a great way to not have to think about your dependencies long-term
[23:06] isaacs: then when someone else on your team (or, you, a few weeks later) check out the code, you can run `npm install` wiht no args to get all the deps

[23:17] isaacs: MaSch: npm help folders

[23:20] mape: if you have a proper package.json it will work fine

[23:20] isaacs: MaSch: or `npm install --link`
[23:21] mape: MaSch: I felt like you at first, but as modules update and APIs break, the new way is far better. Especially if you have more then a couple projects

[23:28] isaacs: TheEmpath: inheritance should be doable in 10 lines or fewer.
[23:28] TheEmpath: function a() {...} function b() { ...} a.prototype = new b();  
[23:28] _sorensen_: isaacs: nice
[23:28] TheEmpath: problem is you get double constructors :(
[23:29] isaacs: TheEmpath: not with inherits, you don't
[23:29] isaacs: TheEmpath: you have to do Blah.call(this)
[23:29] TheEmpath: i believe there was s hortcoming with inherits....
[23:29] isaacs: Parent.call(this)
[23:29] _sorensen_: ima feel bad requiring that :P
[23:29] isaacs: it's too short so there's nothing to whine and bikeshed about?
[23:29] isaacs: i mean, that's kind of a shortcoming
[23:29] isaacs: that IS the main use case for OOP pattern libs, after all.
[23:30] TheEmpath: i remember seeing this super detailed breakdown of the various ways to do classes... can't find it now
[23:30] tjholowaychuk: it would be nicer if we did it like lua
[23:30] tjholowaychuk: without the hybrid classical/proto thinger
[23:31] isaacs: TheEmpath: Child.prototype = new Parent <-- that is broken
[23:31] isaacs: you need to use Object.create
[23:31] isaacs: and inherits makes it so that the order doesn't matter.  whatever you add on the Child.prototype will be preserved.
[23:32] _sorensen_: inherits has to be the smallest lib i've seen

[23:34] isaacs: the util.inherits in node-core is almost the same exact function

[23:35] ritch has left the channel
[23:35] isaacs: even shorter, actually, but doesn't preserve existing stuff

[23:39] industrial: isaacs: just out of curiousity; why do you only have one semicolon and why is it on the next line o_O

[23:41] isaacs: industrial: in case you decide to adopt such a style, beware of talking about it: http://blog.izs.me/post/3393190720/how-this-works
[23:41] isaacs: people are religious
[23:42] industrial: "In front of a leading ( or [ at the start of the line. This prevents the expression from being interpreted as a function call or property access, respectively." <-- that wouldn't happen with semicolons though, imho.

[23:59] isaacs: industrial: yeah, if you put a semi at the end of *every single line* then it could never happen.  but it's easy to miss one.

[23:59] gen: I'm wondering in a scenario where one callback is doing a long task, what happens to other callbacks that get called during that time? do they get called or what?
