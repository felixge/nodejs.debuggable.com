[00:00] orospakr: perhaps there are old crufty settings hanging around?
[00:01] tbranyen: orospakr: isn't that an npmrc setting?
[00:01] orospakr: where does that live?
[00:01] tbranyen: i think in the home directory
[00:01] orospakr: nope, checked.
[00:02] tbranyen: oh wait isn't an install flag
[00:02] tbranyen: how did you install it?
[00:02] orospakr: imladris% npm install zombie
[00:02] orospakr: > zombie@0.9.5 install /home/orospakr/node_modules/zombie
[00:02] orospakr: my pwd was not my homedir.
[00:02] tbranyen: curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
[00:02] tbranyen: right?
[00:02] orospakr: yes.
[00:03] orospakr: cruft removal procedure run, etc.
[00:03] orospakr: If I destroy ~/node_modules and ~/.npm, the same behaviour happens all over again.
[00:03] tbranyen: i dunno try removing the node_modules folder from your home direct
[00:03] orospakr: did.
[00:03] tbranyen: hmmm

[00:03] orospakr: npm and I have never been friends. :/
[00:04] davve: ½½§§§öäå
[00:04] orospakr: now, if I have a package.json in my project's dir, and it describes some dependencies, and I run "npm install", then the expected behaviour happens.
[00:04] emacsen: For testing purposes, I need to slow something down. sleep() would be good. I'm using setTimeout, but then because it's async, I can't force the process to wait for the timeouts to complete. I know I must be missing something to do this easily, but can someone tell me what it is?
[00:04] phpnode has joined the channel
[00:05] tbranyen: emacsen: thats not the nature of node
[00:05] tbranyen: if you want synchronous sleeping i dunno try java
[00:05] tbranyen: closest thing i can think of is using a long for/while loop, but thats just retarded
[00:05] emacsen: tbranyen, that's a ridiculous response. Telling people to "go away" isn't in any way helpful
[00:06] m0s has joined the channel
[00:06] tbranyen: emacsen: no... asking for synchronous behavior in an event driven architecture is a ridiculous question

[00:07] SubStack: emacsen: setInterval
[00:07] tbranyen: orospakr: how would that owrk?
[00:07] tbranyen: there is nothing in javascript to natively do that
[00:07] orospakr: tbranyen, a builtin that would invoke posix' sleep(), block the entire runtime?
[00:08] SubStack: var n = 0; var iv = setInterval(function () { if (n >= 555) clearInterval(iv) }, 1000)
[00:08] SubStack: oh and n++ somewhere in there
[00:08] orospakr: lots of API in node wraps standard POSIX/libc.
[00:08] tbranyen: orospakr: yea i just don't know how that affects v8 and the event loop
[00:08] tbranyen: not seeing anything in google, maybe something like that exists?
[00:09] SubStack: emacsen: but even if you didn't know about setInterval you could implement it with setTimeout and recursion
[00:09] orospakr: events would back up, and when the poll() loop was entered again the events would all be flushed.
[00:09] tbranyen: SubStack: which is the recommended way of doing it
[00:09] orospakr: tbranyen, you must understand there is no magic here.
[00:09] emacsen: SubStack, sadly I don't see any simple for loop, setTimeout methods that also have a callback, that's basically what I need
[00:09] orospakr: node'll behave the same was as any polling posix app.
[00:09] emacsen: I won't need this forever, but do during testing
[00:10] tbranyen: orospakr: are you sure about that?
[00:10] orospakr: pretty sure.
[00:10] tbranyen: orospakr: i'm not seeing any native sleep modules
[00:10] SubStack: emacsen: fuck for loops
[00:10] SubStack: emacsen: learn 2 recursion
[00:10] orospakr: tbranyen, make one.
[00:10] orospakr: probably be a pretty trivial patch to node.
[00:10] tbranyen: orospakr: well thats what i'm saying, maybe there is a reason for that
[00:10] tbranyen: also its pretty useless
[00:10] orospakr: well, all you can do is try. :)
[00:10] tbranyen: why waste time writing it
[00:10] emacsen: SubStack, I read most of The Little Schemer
[00:11] SubStack: emacsen: just use setInterval, I don't see what the problem is
[00:11] emacsen: that's why there's this bump on my skull where my brain pushes out

[06:53] fille: taking the title, meta, and looking for contact
[06:53] fille: going to connect the spider to express.js so i can kontoll it with a webinterface
[06:54] tuhoojabotti: I see.
[06:54] jonaslund: I made a simple JS cloaker for my company webpage
[06:54] jonaslund: haven't got a single spam to that addr yet
[06:54] fille: thats sounds cool. 
[06:54] tuhoojabotti: Mine's even simpler but it sucks
[06:54] tuhoojabotti: :D
[06:55] Garo_: I just use gmail ;)
[06:55] tuhoojabotti: I should edit it but I'm too lazy
[06:55] fille: but with node.js u can run your email script
[06:55] tuhoojabotti: Garo_: I use gmail too.
[06:55] fille: and get the real output
[06:55] jonaslund: anyhow
[06:55] tuhoojabotti: fille: Not if it outputs canvas!
[06:55] tuhoojabotti: bwahaha

[06:55] Garo_: btw the amount of spam that gets delivered to the gmail spam folder as dropped. It's currently only about 280 emails when it was over 800 just a few months ago
[06:55] wenbert has joined the channel
[06:55] tuhoojabotti: So is mine
[06:56] fille: i get alot of wordpress spam
[06:56] jonaslund: that mailto link is kinda easily detectable :P
[06:56] tuhoojabotti: Garo_: I get  perhaps 1 in 3 months
[06:56] fille: but the wordpress spam filter is really good
[06:56] jonaslund: although
[06:56] jonaslund: *hmm*
[06:56] Garo_: tuhoojabotti: I mean that what gets caught into the spam folder. I get a spam to my inbox just about one in 3 months, just as you
[06:56] jonaslund: i could make an onmousedown handler for the canvas element
[06:56] jonaslund: that redirects to a magic url that redirects to a mailto link?
[06:56] tuhoojabotti: Garo_: I was talking about the spam folder.
[06:57] Garo_: tuhoojabotti: not bad then :)
[06:57] fille: u minified the canvas javascript code then?
[06:57] tuhoojabotti: fille: I'll add some nasty script to my email scribbler and then when you eval it...
[06:57] jonaslund: fille: I guess i should add code that detects node and tries to disrupt your process
[06:57] tuhoojabotti: :D
[06:57] jonaslund: ahhaha
[06:58] fille: another cool thing would to send false information to google analytics
[06:59] tuhoojabotti: Very cool!
[06:59] tuhoojabotti: fille you're a cool guy!
[06:59] fille: i know :D
[06:59] jonaslund: hmmm
[06:59] jonaslund: how to detect node?
[06:59] fille: we just need to figure out how google analytics works :D
[06:59] jonaslund: if ("undefined" != typeof require) ..

[07:00] jonaslund: tuhoojabotti: yeah i was considering that

[07:08] _anna_1 has joined the channel
[07:08] kkaefer: chrisdickinson: the tricky part is that you have to execute the callback functions in the main v8 thread
[07:08] chrisdickinson: yep
[07:08] tuhoojabotti: SubStack: imagick gave 404 on github :D
[07:08] kkaefer: but most of the sqlite functions run in the threadpool
[07:08] chrisdickinson: kkaefer: that's exactly where i'm running aground, actually :)
[07:09] wenbert: hi let's say i have my website on apache listening at port 80. i want to add a chat-thingy. I use node.js at port 8000. will this make sense if I just *blah* http://localhost:8000?
[07:09] SubStack: tuhoojabotti: not all node modules on npm are on github regrettably
[07:09] haper has joined the channel
[07:09] kkaefer: chrisdickinson: I haven't tried implementing it so far though

[07:09] fille: webert need to build a deamon
[07:09] tuhoojabotti: SubStack: It had a link that gave 404, anyways I found it
[07:10] tuhoojabotti: or something else.
[07:10] chrisdickinson: kkaefer: yeah. my (naive) implementation basically runs into that problem, which is helpfully reported by V8 as 'Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded' whenever you try to call the callback.
[07:11] kkaefer: hm, that sounds like you're calling another callback from the callback
[07:12] SubStack: wenbert: there is a module on npm called "forever" that does exactly as advertised
[07:12] wenbert: does it make sense i run node.js at http://localhost:8000 and make javascript ajax calls from my live site? (node.js installed on the same machine)
[07:12] chrisdickinson: kkaefer: it's because it's trying to run V8 code on a drastically different stack location, and V8 is set up to barf RangeErrors when a function exits the current stack space
[07:13] wenbert: thanks SubStack! also found this: http://kevin.vanzonneveld.net/techblog/article/run_nodejs_as_a_service_on_ubuntu_karmic/ which one should I use?

[07:13] shinmei has joined the channel
[07:13] SubStack: wenbert: whichever you like, they aren't so different

[07:15] wenbert: nice
[07:15] kkaefer: chrisdickinson: how are you ensuring that the callback fn runs in the v8 thread?
[07:15] chrisdickinson: kkaefer: i'm not. hence the range error.

[07:17] chrisdickinson: kkaefer: yeah ):
[07:17] kkaefer: the last resort may be v8::Locker
[07:17] kkaefer: but I've never got that to work correctly
[07:17] fille: wenbert i  guess u are usinig the socket.io?
[07:18] kkaefer: and I've been told that the implementation isn't quite ready for public usage
[07:18] kkaefer: maybe that changed since february
[07:19] chrisdickinson: kkaefer: well, from the (scant) documentation i was able to find on it, you can't share handles between isolates (which the locker works on)

[08:06] AAA_awright: I hate Python for that reason, but Jade isn't a scripting language

[08:14] foober: Depending on your registrar, you can register a domain for up to 10 years.
[08:14] rhdoenges: sweet. and usually they're pretty cheap, right?
[08:14] rhdoenges: it's the hosting that will get you.
[08:14] foober: The trick is actually finding a domain not used.

[08:19] foober: Even worse than when Bush was in office.
[08:21] foober: Originally, I think I went directly through network solutions, though I wouldn't dream of it now.  Now I'd use GoDaddy (but watch out for all the upsells, it's annoying), or daily.co.uk, which I like better.

[09:08] guybrush: the trailing dots in that link suck (all Together ...) :p
[09:08] tranver: `3rdEden, I did -g in first place to make it available to all developers on this machine
[09:09] guybrush: tranver: every developer can install the package he wants himself :p
[09:10] tranver: guybrush: ok good to know that's the way to go in node.js
[09:10] m0s has joined the channel
[09:11] guybrush: well there are usecases for -g!
[09:11] guybrush: e.g. you want to install a package which provides a cli-tool
[09:11] tranver: ah ok, like mpn for example
[09:11] tranver: *npm
[09:11] guybrush: right
[09:11] guybrush: but in general you want to install packages locally
[09:12] cfq has joined the channel
[09:12] guybrush: you will end up with a directory-hierarchie containing the same package multiple times! but its just fine
[09:13] tranver: and do you normally exclude the node_modules dir from your scm?
[09:13] guybrush: yes
[09:13] SubStack: that's what npm is for!
[09:14] guybrush: but again there are usecases where you can put the node_modules-folder into your scm
[09:14] guybrush: e.g. your package is using a patched version of another package
[09:14] dexter_e: Is there a way to inject shared little chunks of html code into any view?
[09:14] sandstrom: threepwood: Thanks for helping out! I couldn't find anything on client-side usage of jade in the examples folder, unfortunately.
[09:14] sandstrom: guybrush: 
[09:15] guybrush: sandstrom: check out jadeify!
[09:15] `3rdEden has joined the channel
[09:15] guybrush: jade is shipped with a client-version though
[09:15] sandstrom: guybrush: It's an excellent suggestion, however I think it might be best if I can get client-side interpreted templates (using only jade) to work first.
[09:15] guybrush: but i like to browserify it :D
[09:15] dexter_e: I think partials are shared little chunks of html code that can be injected into any view.. but how are they accessed in the view?
[09:16] guybrush: sandstrom: take a look at https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/tree/master/example/npm-jade and https://github.com/substack/node-jadeify/tree/master/example/simple
[09:17] guybrush: this is how you do client-side jade :p
[09:17] tranver: I appreciate your help guybrush. thanks for kickstarting me into dependency management in node.js ;)
[09:17] guybrush: glad i could help
[09:18] guybrush: im off now to get some sleep! have fun with toying arround :p
[09:18] tranver: I'll :) good night!
[09:18] sandstrom: guybrush: I

[11:58] tjholowaychuk: git isn't really a deployment tool

[14:01] eirikb: yorick: I have no idea. But if you use MooTools I don't think they map up with ES5 like underscore does, at least
[14:01] yorick: eirikb: then why did you say so
[14:01] eirikb: yorick: Because people tell me it's bad of course. I have to bounce best practices, even without a good reason, don't you think?
[14:01] systemfault: Come on...
[14:02] systemfault: It's bad practice..
[14:02] yorick: eirikb: you mean like semicolons
[14:02] yorick: systemfault: why is it?
[14:02] eirikb: yorick: Semicolon insertion you mean?

[14:03] yorick: systemfault: if I require a library that is designed to extend native prototypes, I'm well aware that it might cause conflicts
[14:03] systemfault: semi-colons are too mainstream
[14:03] yorick: 16:01 < eirikb> yorick: Because people tell me it's bad of course. I have to bounce best practices, even without a good reason, don't you think?
[14:03] yorick: people have bounced semicolons for years now
[14:03] systemfault: yorick: On node.js, it won't matter, in a browser.. it's looking for trouble.

[14:06] colinclark has joined the channel
[14:07] eirikb: yorick: Code consistency is great, don't you think?
[14:07] yorick: eirikb: semicolon insertion occurs when you put semicolons everywhere, too
[14:07] systemfault: The only difference if that if the guy can code without them then he knows about it :P
[14:07] yorick: if you do return\n{\na:10\n}, it's bad regardless of whether you put semicolons everywhere or not, it will not behave as intended
[14:07] systemfault: Instead of naively just adding ; everywhere
[14:08] yorick: eirikb: code consistency can happens without semicolons
[14:08] systemfault: isaac's code is pretty consistent to me.
[14:08] yorick: and quite lovely

[14:13] mrryanjohnston-e: When I do something like Animal.prototype.sound, what exactly does this do? Does this ONLY effect objects that were made by the Animal constructor? It doesn't seem to do anything directly to the Animal function itself.

[14:13] yorick: systemfault: :-)
[14:13] eirikb: I never said he did though
[14:14] yorick: eirikb: yes, there can be conflicts outside browsers, but that's the users responsibility for including a library which extends native prototypes (if that is its only purpose)

[17:14] darren: I've got a long-running child process (python, actually) and I'm writing pure python syntax strings to it's stdin.
[17:15] darren: I can display the stdout, and it's working just fine.  But now, I'd like a way to tie requests and responses together.
[17:15] darren:  Unfortunately, exec seems to assume it owns the whole lifecycle of the child, spawn to exit.
[17:15] gaara: darren, the link you gave dint really help, because in your example, everything was in the same folder, what happens when  you try to require stuff in subfolders?
[17:15] luke` has joined the channel
[17:15] Poetro1 has joined the channel
[17:15] darren: I'd like more of a callback driven approach, to correlate reqs and responses to the child (python shell)
[17:16] tjholowaychuk: use spawn()?
[17:16] tjholowaychuk: instead
[17:16] darren: gaara: sorry man.  the whole include thing is a bit of a labyrinth at times.  try prefixing with ./path/getData.js
[17:16] tjholowaychuk: exec is higher level
[17:17] darren: tj: yeah, using spawn already... just need a way to link the commands I write to child's stdin to the data that comes spewing out of it's stdout
[17:17] gaara: darren, so try not making the process as a long running process instead call it with spawn
[17:17] tjholowaychuk: darren: oh
[17:17] gaara: darren, yea i tried that also...dint work :(
[17:17] tjholowaychuk: yeah you'll have to frame anything yourself
[17:17] tjholowaychuk: if you have some kind of json rpc or whatever it may be
[17:17] darren: gaara: so the whole idea is to leave the child process running as a long running so as to retain state (ie. the loaded imports, data structures etc)
[17:18] darren: argh, I was fraid of that

[17:19] gaara: lol true
[17:19] darren: what do you database-wrapper author geniuses do to get the synchronous call-response behavior for db queries?
[17:20] tjholowaychuk: you dont, you have a callback :p
[17:20] Poetro has joined the channel
[17:20] jonmaim has left the channel

[17:21] darren: can you point me to an example module maybe?
[17:21] tjholowaychuk: i'm just saying whatever the data is, is completely arbitrary, you have to parse it appropriately
[17:21] tjholowaychuk: node just says here's your shit
[17:21] tjholowaychuk: do whatever you want
[17:22] darren: yeah, i'm afraid i'll have to implement a sort of queue to correlate the responses with the originating request.

[17:35] yorick: are global objects not shared across modules?

[19:23] JKarsrud: MarcinM: you don't have /Users/youruser/ ?
[19:23] bnoordhuis: MarcinM: but you can also install step with npm
[19:23] MarcinM: @bnoordhuis: tried that. Step still is undefined.
[19:23] MarcinM: I did install step with npm :)
[19:24] darren: MarcinM: set NODE_PATH env?

[19:27] JKarsrud: where did you install node?
[19:27] MarcinM: apparently $home/local/node

[19:27] MarcinM: adding to path now

[19:28] mustakes has joined the channel
[19:28] JKarsrud: for some reason :(
[19:28] darren: if you build as root, it'll go into /usr/ ... I think they kinda switched from recommending /usr to more of a local approach
[19:29] JKarsrud: sure, doesn't really matter
[19:29] JKarsrud: aslong as it works
[19:29] darren: just for security reasons, etc
[19:29] JKarsrud: but ofc /usr/ is kinda the place I'd want it, but still
[19:29] Wizek has joined the channel
[19:29] JKarsrud: not that important
[19:30] darren: you can definitely make it go into /usr, just run the install with sudo and set the config options a little differntly from the joyent tute.
[19:30] MarcinM: argh, Step still not defined after all that
[19:31] darren: try running npm ls
[19:31] darren: and npm -g ls
[19:31] MarcinM: i do notice step as an nmp package doesn't have an index. All other modules do.
[19:31] MarcinM: … but I added one and that didn't do anything :P
[19:32] MarcinM: step's in both list and -g list

[22:41] MarcinM: but yeah, it won't tell you how good or how recent the odule is, that's for sure
[22:41] isaacs: context: but for changing node versions, nave, n, and nvm are all pretty widely used.
[22:41] Evanlec: MarcinM: what I meant was, for example here: http://search.npmjs.org/#/mongo-pool
[22:41] context: isaacs: s/context/nuclearsandwich/ ;)
[22:41] bnoordhuis: context: you need to call .end() on the request object
[22:41] Evanlec: MarcinM: it says it is a wrapper for node-mongodb-native
[22:41] ajdavis: AvianFlu: wget http://nodejs.org/dist/node-v0.4.9.tar.gz; tar xzvf node-v0.4.9.tar.gz; cd node-v0.4.9; ./configure; # Segmentation fault
[22:41] nuclearsandwich: context: yeah. Homebrew installs 0.4.9, which is what I want to play with. But Heroku mandates Node 0.4.7 so I have to manage both.
[22:41] Evanlec: MarcinM: but the npm module is actually just called mongodb
[22:41] isaacs: oh, right :)
[22:41] Evanlec: MarcinM: just confused me 
[22:42] MarcinM: ah, I see
[22:42] AvianFlu: ajdavis: does it say anything besides segmentation fault?
[22:42] bnoordhuis: ajdavis: can you gist or pastie the output of ./configure ?
[22:42] context: bnoordhuis: i still never see my console.log()'s  even after 5 seconds
[22:43] bnoordhuis: context: can you update your pastie?
[22:43] ajdavis: AvianFlu: sorry, no - i could investigate the core dump, etc., but i was hoping this was a known problem. it's a stock install of Ubuntu, on Slicehost
[22:43] context: bnoordhuis: i just added .end() to it
[22:43] tenumm has joined the channel
[22:43] ajdavis: bnoordhuis: ./configure says "Segmentation fault" immediately, with no prior output
[22:43] context: bnoordhuis: refresh
[22:44] context: the top i have running through a node cli call... been running for like 30 seconds still
[22:45] context-: .start() doesnt work .end() doesnt work
[22:45] bnoordhuis: ajdavis: what does the configure script look like?
[22:45] bnoordhuis: ajdavis: it can't really segfault, it's a shell script
[22:45] brianc1 has joined the channel
[22:46] ajdavis: i see that, it must be in waf-light (a Python script) or deeper
[22:46] kriszyp has joined the channel
[22:46] ajdavis: "./tools/waf-light --jobs=1 configure", which is what ./configure runs, segfaults
[22:46] nuclearsandwich: I am tempted to go with nvm, since it appears the most similar to rvm (not just the name). Perhaps I can extend it to monitor for .nvmrc files optionally.
[22:46] DoNaLd`: hi .. i use expressj and i have one form with two different submit button for this one form .. and i need in post methode in nodejs detect with which submit button was submited my form .. exist some methode for this my issue ?
[22:47] onar has joined the channel
[22:47] ajdavis: well, screw me with a nail file, it's related to my custom-compiled version of python 2.7.  when I run "python2.6 ./tools/waf-light --jobs=1 configure" to use Ubuntu's stock python, the script completes
[22:48] ajdavis: AvianFlu, bnoordhuis, thanks for your attention, i seem to have fixed my problem w/o knowing the cause =)
[22:48] bnoordhuis: ajdavis: hah, glad you got it fixed :)

[23:07] aliffia: hey all, new to node, wanted to see if this was a possibility: connect to mysql database and check for updates, and show on a  php page if there are updates

[23:16] chjj: aliffia: what do you mean, "show on a php page"?
[23:17] aliffia: i currently have an ajax refresher that constantly reloads a php page that polls the DB... but I don't want that constant checking, and from what i've been reading, node.js can push those changes to the client, instead of the ajax refresher
[23:17] aliffia: with the current refreshing, it causes me to be unable to enter text into this div
[23:18] chjj: well even if you used websockets, you will still have to poll the db
[23:18] mikeycgto has joined the channel
[23:19] cafesofie has joined the channel
[23:19] nsolsen has joined the channel
[23:19] aliffia: i guess my biggest problem is my current inability to enter text on that page, while it's constantly ajax refreshing. 
[23:19] jgv_ has joined the channel
[23:19] ajsie: aliffia: if you don't put something into the db you don't have to poll it
[23:19] MarcinM: sounds like your ajax is badly set up then. your page shouldn't be refreshing if you're polling via ajax
[23:19] chjj: yeah, that is a client side issue then
[23:20] chjj: you need to fix your client side code first
[23:20] aliffia: hmm alright
[23:20] ajsie: aliffia: you push something into the db .. then you server push it into the clients
[23:20] ajsie: don't pull the db when you haven't updated it .. thats my view
[23:21] caolanm has joined the channel
[23:21] aliffia: but if another user has caused a db update, it should be able to show that to the user that was already on the page
[23:22] ajsie: your backend will push the update into db .. but then push the update into all the clients
[23:22] ajsie: the backend is handling the communication with clients and dbs
[23:22] aliffia: via ajax or via node?
[23:22] ajsie: node
[23:22] ajsie: if that is your backend
[23:22] ajsie: if you push something into db,  then you should push that change into the clients right
[23:22] materialdesigner has joined the channel
[23:23] ajsie: since you just updated it
[23:23] aliffia: yeah. thats what i was confirming, node's ability to push from a mysql database
[23:23] ajsie: not pushing FROM mysql db
[23:23] ajsie: but from node.js
[23:23] MarcinM: it's not that it pushes, it just emits an event that your server can emit
[23:23] ajsie: to clients
[23:23] MarcinM: err that your client can listen to
[23:23] aliffia: hmm
[23:24] MarcinM: but if you're running php, then node is not a plugin solution for you
[23:24] RevoOf1 has joined the channel
[23:24] ajsie: if he is running php then node can still listen on changes
[23:24] RevoOf1: hi
[23:24] MarcinM: can it?
[23:24] aliffia: before i started rebuilding a backend in node, i wanted to confirm.
[23:24] ajsie: i dont know about mysql .. couchdb can fire event when there is changes
[23:25] MarcinM: how can a php server listen to a node server … my head asplode
[23:25] ajsie: if mysql doesn't have this i suppose he has to auto poll
[23:25] ajsie: pull
[23:25] aliffia: currently my app has been fine using php,mysql,jquery
[23:25] ajsie: MarcinM: node listen on mysql 
[23:25] MarcinM: yes, and then what
[23:25] ajsie: php do whatever its already doing
[23:25] aliffia: but as i mentioned, trying to switch to more of a push than a constant refresh
[23:25] ajsie: then push the data to the clients with websocket
[23:25] NeCkEr has joined the channel
[23:25] RevoOf1: is there something like http://php.net/manual/en/function.unserialize.php in node?
[23:26] ajsie: but imo that is a pretty bad design .. either use node.js or just php
[23:26] MarcinM: right
[23:26] Lorentz: Polling the db itself is probably inevitable, don't think mysql can trigger to push stuff to outside of it.
[23:26] MarcinM: that's one too many servers in there
[23:26] ajsie: if you want this kind of power .. just use node =)
[23:26] ajsie: php really sucks since its based on threads
[23:26] ajsie: cant handle concurrency as good as node.js
[23:27] aliffia: right. trying to learn node to rebuild my backend. 
[23:28] ajsie: look into couchdb as well and see if it fits you
[23:28] ajsie: javascript/json/html
[23:28] ajsie: javascript fullstack =)
[23:28] MarcinM: ajsie: hmm are you sure node can listen to mysql
[23:28] MarcinM: w/o polling
[23:28] ajsie: no
[23:29] ajsie: no nothing about mysql
[23:29] ajsie: know
[23:29] aliffia: hmm ill do a bit of research on that. thanks guys
[23:29] ajsie: anyone here that is using cloud9ide?
[23:30] MarcinM: aliffia: You'd still be polling, but serverside. Then you could push to the front-end.
[23:30] MarcinM: Hope that helps
[23:30] smtlaissezfaire has joined the channel
[23:31] aliffia: MarcinM: yeah makes sense. im thinking i may be able to just rewrite how my ajax is connecting to avoid it from preventing text input
[23:31] MarcinM: yeah, that'd certainly be a start
[23:31] mikey_p: or you could just use events, and update all the interested clients when you receive a message, then you don't have to poll the DB
[23:32] springmeyer_ has joined the channel
[23:32] mikey_p: this isn't rocket surgery
[23:32] MarcinM: sometimes it is. when the docs are out of date or nonexistent. :)
[23:33] Lorentz: This wouldn't be in docs anywhere.
[23:33] mikey_p: i mean the concept isn't that hard
[23:33] MarcinM: zackly
[23:33] Jamool has joined the channel
[23:34] MarcinM: it is when you haven't worked with events much before :P

[23:34] aliffia: newer to events. 
[23:34] sounko has joined the channel
[23:35] mikey_p: yeah it takes quite a jump for your average PHP dev (speaking of my own experience)
[23:35] mikey_p: but when you get it, it's such a freeing world to have some form of persistent state instead of the crap that is most PHP apps/frameworks
[23:36] MarcinM: very true
[23:36] azeroth_ has joined the channel
[23:36] aliffia: ive been able to keep most of my content pretty streamlined with ajax, but hitting some (personal) limits 
[23:37] Lorentz: I wouldn't say it's php's fault, it's just that php is mostly deployed as part of a stateless web server.
[23:37] Lorentz: You can perfectly have php daemons.
[23:37] tauren: What's a good way to log an object hierarchy? Doing console.log(myObject) simply outputs [ Object ]. Is there something in node to pretty print an object, or a good suggested module to do so?
[23:37] Lorentz: (although it's kinda retarded and not made for it, obviously because market is driven to use it with a web server, which is a cycle)

[23:48] tauren: ctide: grr... the object i'm printing is an array. and it still outputs: [ 'toplevel', [ [ 'stat', [Object] ] ] ]
[23:49] ctide: it only goes so deep to avoid recursion
[23:49] tauren: gotcha. i'll use inspect directly then.
