[00:17] kenperkins: ;) typically node.js dialog, npm, features and bugs, sites built with node
[00:18] lulzfish_4: npm?
[00:19] isaacs: lulzfish_4: the program manager for node
[00:19] isaacs: lulzfish_4: npmjs.org

[00:19] lulzfish_4: Another language-oriented package manager... 
[00:19] isaacs: yep
[00:20] EyePulp: lulzfish_4: that's the size of it.
[00:20] isaacs: platform-oriented, to be more specific, i guess
[00:20] EyePulp: awesome-oriented.
[00:20] isaacs: but most of the time, language implies platform.  js is a bit weird in that it is a language that spans more than one platform.

[00:22] lulzfish_4: I can see why they don't use the system-level PM though, since they 
[00:22] lulzfish_4: yes exactly
[00:22] ryah: answer: sucking
[00:22] lulzfish_4: I was gonna say namespaces
[00:23] lulzfish_4: I guess you are right about platform

[00:23] mdaisuke has joined the channel
[00:23] SubStack: if node were using a non-node specific package manager it would suck
[00:23] lulzfish_4: 17,000 domains?
[00:23] EyePulp: si
[00:23] tjholowaychuk: jesus
[00:23] EyePulp: and shockingly, it's not even link farming.
[00:23] EyePulp: =)
[00:23] lulzfish_4: What is it

[00:25] EyePulp: we manage the services and domains.
[00:25] tjholowaychuk: we have marketing crap through like 28

[00:27] EyePulp: corporate just wants to make sure their pages are properly maintained (and controlled), and the reps don't generally want the headache of setting up their own stuff.
[00:27] lulzfish_4: Yeah you want to avoid headaches
[00:28] EyePulp: it's a relatively niche need, but it's worth the effort for a small company like ours to do.  It's just something our client didn't want to do.

[00:29] lulzfish_4: How small is your company? Do they just do web stuff?
[00:29] EyePulp: we'd been on a python/django based system for a while, but a recent change on the corp backend made it a good time to consider a rebuild of the old system.

[00:40] tjholowaychuk: voodootikigod_ should work now
[00:40] niftylettuce: tjholowaychuk: how bout you bro?

[00:40] voodootikigod_: tjholowaychuk: how do I circumvent the npm limit?
[00:41] tjholowaychuk: voodootikigod_ it's not letting you install it?
[00:41] tjholowaychuk: i can
[00:41] tjholowaychuk: with 0.5.10
[00:41] voodootikigod_: oh
[00:41] voodootikigod_: "engines": { "node":">= 0.5.0 < 0.7.0" }
[00:41] voodootikigod_: you updated that

[00:47] tjholowaychuk: im running out of names too
[00:48] isaacs: so... a tarball contains files, right?
[00:48] prabs_ has joined the channel
[00:48] tjholowaychuk: llabrat
[00:48] niftylettuce: EyePulp: how do you do DKIM with nodemailer
[00:48] isaacs: i'm expressing that as something like:  var p = new tar.Parser();  fs.createReadStream("file.tar").pipe(p); p.on("file", function (f) { ... })
[00:49] isaacs: so, f has header (stat-alike) info, like f.name, f.mtime, etc.  it's also a readable stream.
[00:49] EyePulp: at the moment I'm not.  I thought that was handled at your relay, anyhowâ€¦ but I could be mistaken.
[00:49] isaacs: what should that class be called?  "File" seems too vague.
[00:49] prabs_: Hi im wonder if someone could kindly help me with running nodejs and nowjs
[00:49] isaacs: TarFile makes it sound like it's a representation of a tarball file itself.
[00:49] prabs_: I have installed nodejs on windows xp and tried to run demo app from nowjs but get error -> message: 'cannot find module \'node-proxy\'
[00:49] isaacs: ugh.  so annoying.
[00:49] prabs_: i have tried to install via npm install node-proxy but it doesn't do anything. under node_modules it doesn't get installed.
[00:50] prabs_: however i ran npm install socket.io and that installed fine (so i think)
[00:50] jtsnow has joined the channel
[00:50] isaacs: prabs_: go into your project dir, and run `npm ls`

[01:47] zikes: is there an express middleware module that will let me pass the session id as a GET or POST parameter?
[01:48] niftylettuce: zikes: why would you want to do that? and you could just use express-params
[01:48] niftylettuce: zikes: e.g. your route app.get('/mypath/:session_id', function(req,res,next) {});
[01:49] niftylettuce: zikes: you might want to ask in #express

[01:51] mrchess: yeah
[01:51] mrchess: was wondering if anyone was using an ORM in production
[01:51] zikes: niftylettuce: the idea is that it would be passed as a consistent "ticket" parameter either as GET or POST, and be automatically picked up by the session middleware before it reaches routing
[01:51] deedubs has joined the channel
[01:51] devrim has joined the channel
[01:51] niftylettuce: zikes: why do you need to have it as a GET/POST
[01:52] zikes: niftylettuce: thinking I could stick some middleware between cookieParser and session to accomplish it, but hoping someone else has had the same idea
[01:52] niftylettuce: zikes: if its a session ID, you can simply just use req.session._id or something
[01:52] daneroo has joined the channel
[01:52] niftylettuce: zikes: seems like overkill for something that is accessible on every route
[01:52] ttpva: In Mongoose, I'm not being able to get the embedded document as an object, only as an array. Is it supposed to be that way?
[01:52] zikes: niftylettuce: because the session ID comes from the cookie, and I don't want my public-facing API to require Cookie spoofing headers

[02:29] torm3nt has joined the channel
[02:31] EyePulp: thompson: not that I've heard of.  node's doesn't really have what I'd call a rails/django level platform on top of it at this point, or not with as much polish.  It tends towards bare-metal services underneath...
[02:32] EyePulp: (just my opinionâ€¦)
[02:32] tbranyen: yeah thats a good thing
[02:32] tbranyen: i like where node is compared to django/rails
[02:33] EyePulp: sure - we'll still use django for a lot of frontend web app work, and tie it to postgres/mongo, but then for API and services such as chat, we'll be on node.

[05:15] deoxxombie: how do i add a path to require so it'll be used in included modules as well?
[05:16] deoxxombie: i want to have a "lib" directory in my root application with various components in it
[05:16] kenperkins: var foo = require('path/to/something');
[05:17] deoxxombie: then i want anything require()'d into the application to be able to do require("foo") and recieve the correct object if there's a "foo" module in the lib directory
[05:18] deoxxombie: giving them the relative location of the file from its own location isn't an option in this case, the required components could be anywhere
[05:18] bnoordhuis: deoxxombie: $project_dir/node_modules or $NODE_PATH?
[05:18] kenperkins: that too
[05:18] deoxxombie: hm, i tried with node_modules, still doesn't work
[05:19] deoxxombie: basically it looks like this:
[05:19] deoxxombie: ./software/application/app.js ./config/application/config.js
[05:19] deoxxombie: ./software/application is a git submodule
[05:20] deoxxombie: config.js is require()d into the application (i.e. require(process.argv[2]))
[05:20] deoxxombie: i want require() calls in config.js to be able to reach ./config/application/node_modules
[05:21] deoxxombie: note that it works fine if config.js is at ./software/application/config.js

[06:58] martin_sunset: Hey kenperkins: just a quick FYI: we are going to create an oauth2 provider for passport in the next one or two weeks, let me know if you or your colleges need specific features
[06:58] bnoordhuis: but in this case it was fixed in a number of commits

[07:18] raphdg has joined the channel
[07:19] martin_sunset: kenperkins: Btw, the requests are not signed with hmac in oauth2 , I think that is what you meant. Instead te token is as a secret
[07:20] martin_sunset: Is used as the secret
[07:20] kenperkins: i see
[07:20] martin_sunset: Hence https transport as a requirement
[07:20] kenperkins: yea
[07:20] kenperkins: we do some fun stuff to get a users secret to them over https but make it available to http javascript for signing
[07:21] Nietecht has joined the channel
[07:21] dvf: I git pulled v0.5.10 and then configure(d) make and make(d) install(ed) but then 'node -v' returns v0.4.1

[10:57] danielss89: Hi.. i have my php application which has users in mysql. Now if i f.x want the users to be able to chat witch each other i need some way of identifying a user. so i need to print the username and password on each page so that i can send it as a request to node.js server and login there too.. But then a thief can just open the source and see the password and username.. How would i go around this?

[13:58] wankdanker: AAA_awright:  I do not understand your question. :-/
[13:58] AAA_awright: wankdanker: Git repositories like on Github is the place to be following packages
[13:58] AAA_awright: Did you check there?
[13:58] wankdanker: oh yeah, it's updated there.
[13:58] AAA_awright: Huh
[13:59] wankdanker: i can clone it from there for sure, just trying to get in the habbit of using npm.
[13:59] knifed has joined the channel
[13:59] wankdanker: and using npm to install from the git repo is failing when unpacking. 
[14:00] AAA_awright: wankdanker: I'd suggest using Git exclusively
[14:01] wankdanker: AAA_awright: yeah. will do that. thanks
[14:01] AAA_awright: Please please, package maintainers, provide Git URLs for your package dependencies :p
[14:02] deedubs: AAA_awright: don't you just use git submodules?
[14:02] AAA_awright: For my applications yeah
[14:02] Aikar: I prefer my approach
[14:02] Aikar: put EVERY dependency in your source tree
[14:03] Aikar: when you checkout a repo, you have everything
[14:03] Aikar: dont have to worry about third parties being online
[14:03] Aikar: others dont need npm, etc
[14:03] Aikar: keep track of how your deps are changing
[14:03] AAA_awright: You could, but repos aren't supposed to have everything
[14:03] Aikar: its just text
[14:03] AAA_awright: If you have modified 3rd party libraries sure
[14:03] Aikar: node does the same thing im talking about :P
[14:04] Aikar: v8 and uv are "bundled"
[14:04] AAA_awright: But throwing in yuicompressor.jar into youre repository, yeah no
[14:04] AAA_awright: *your
[14:04] Aikar: its stupid to checkout a project from your local VCS, but then fail due to a third party being down
[14:04] AAA_awright: Aikar: I mirror those repositories personally
[14:04] deedubs: who has local VCS
[14:04] blup has joined the channel
[14:05] Aikar: deedubs: smart people :P i git push to my server and github so my codes in multiple places
[14:05] AAA_awright: If you use GitHub, it's all "local"
[14:05] Aikar: specifying multiple git push urls for a single "origin" ftw
[14:05] wtfcoder: puting yuicompreessor.jar in the repo under /deps in the correct approach, but dont put the JRE 
[14:05] AAA_awright: That is a pretty win feature
[14:05] daneroo has joined the channel
[14:05] AAA_awright: wtfcoder: Why? I'd really prefer not
[14:06] Aikar: AAA_awright: why? worried about HDD space?
[14:06] AAA_awright: The reasoning is if your libraries have their own 3rd party dependencies, you don't want to replicate that
[14:06] Aikar: storage is so cheap
[14:06] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[14:06] Margle has joined the channel
[14:06] fmeyer has joined the channel
[14:07] Aikar: i enjoy the fact I can clone once, and have a mostly ready checkout (barring a possible make to compile binaries which are gitignored)
[14:07] AAA_awright: Aikar: Not for replication, but for source code management, if you awnt to fork the library, you only want to manage the fork once
[14:07] wtfcoder: depends how you use yuicompressor is part of our deployment and even dev-staging so its versioned along with everything else, avoids the works on my machine crap. if you wanted to be superstart ott engineer you could create a git repo put yui-compressor in it and give its own package.json and include that git repo in your projects package.json deps
[14:07] Aikar: and then restore to a previous version, and also have the deps at that previous version too
[14:07] AAA_awright: I don't want to have to propogate the changes out to all the repositories, that's unnecessary
[14:08] Wizek has joined the channel
[14:08] AAA_awright: Just update the one submodule checked out in one location
[14:08] Aikar: AAA_awright: why? what if one of your projects isnt ready to support the new version
[14:08] Aikar: for reliability, you want that
[14:08] Aikar: your SCM system at a specific revision should be the EXACT code you have tested
[14:08] AAA_awright: That's what submodules are for
[14:08] AAA_awright: So you have exactly one revision checked out
[14:09] Aikar: thats fine, if you use submodules for your own local repos you avoid the 3rd party dependency
[14:09] fangel has joined the channel
[14:09] Aikar: but people tend to just point it at the upstream
[14:09] Aikar: if your using other peoples libs, i say you should bundle. if your using your own libs, then fine use submodules pointing to your own local network repos
[14:10] wtfcoder: a guy i known did that, submodules for everything that we didnt really need to version seperately, was a right PITA
[14:10] Aikar: i personally just bundle those too
[14:10] AAA_awright: the "subtree" method, pointing to a tree instead of a commit, is significantly less flexible
[14:10] AAA_awright: That's my point
[14:10] Aikar: though i guess my loathe for external repos comes from svn externals... those fucking suck so bad and make updates so slow
[14:10] AAA_awright: You can choose to check out a subcommit or not
[14:11] AAA_awright: You don't really have an option if it's a subtree
[14:11] AAA_awright: That's fine for projects like Node.js
[14:11] AAA_awright: But for most programming and modules/libraries, no
[14:11] OneOfOne has joined the channel
[14:11] Aikar: what do you mean a tree instea of a commit?

[14:12] davidcoallier has joined the channel
[14:12] tbranyen: commits contain a tree that represents the entire state of the repo at that commit
[14:12] Aikar: i dont include the sub modules .git dir 
[14:12] AAA_awright: Uh, that's not part of the repository by definition anyways
[14:12] Aikar: i bundle my packages as if you didnt even know it was hosted in another repo
[14:13] _th_n_ has joined the channel
[14:13] Aikar: https://github.com/aikar/nope/tree/master/node_modules
[14:14] Aikar: with my design, you can simply download the tarball and place the contents in node_modules and its usable
[14:14] enmand: How can I emit events from a C++ module in NodeJS -- I've read the C++ EventEmmiter class is deprecated?
[14:14] AAA_awright: Aikar: I wouldn't be loading trees into node_modules, that's about as bad as npm
[14:15] brianc1 has joined the channel
[14:15] AAA_awright: submodules, i.e. commits inside node_modules, makes things significantly more flexible
[14:15] Aikar: thats your opinion, I consider this approach easier to people who use my modules :P
[14:15] bnoordhuis: enmand: https://github.com/bnoordhuis/node-event-emitter - but preferably you'd use MakeCallback()
[14:15] Aikar: gives them more options for using the code
[14:15] Hounth has joined the channel
[14:15] AAA_awright: Because they're independent repositories with their own development history, you can choose to check them out or not
[14:16] enmand: bnoordhuis, great, thanks. I'll have a look
[14:16] Aikar: yes i understand its a duplication of the history, but disk space is cheap, it doesnt bother me :P
[14:16] enmand: bnoordhuis, MakeCallback()?
[14:16] AAA_awright: Aikar: It's really not too hard to use git submodules in a similar manner, mirror the deps next to your repository, and clone using --recursive
[14:16] xetorthio has joined the channel
[14:16] AAA_awright: And with an additional argument you have the exact same checkout
[14:17] sirdancealot has joined the channel

[14:18] Aikar: explaining to your boss you cant work right now because insert X other company is having problems isnt easy
[14:18] AAA_awright: Well then host it yourself
[14:19] Aikar: I am, in the tree of the project that uses it ;)

[14:19] patrickgamer has joined the channel
[14:19] a_meteorite: Filesystem, http, git daemon...

[14:19] a_meteorite: So many options
[14:19] patrickgamer has left the channel
[14:19] AAA_awright: Aikar: The situation doesn't change if you have it in a sibling module or in a subtree
[14:19] AAA_awright: that's my point
[14:19] Renegade001 has joined the channel
[14:20] AAA_awright: So why not use submodules since that adds flexibility
[14:20] Aikar: and trying to explain why i need 30 other reposititories named with node.js's style of so many tiny little projects, they would think thats silly
[14:20] jetienne_ has joined the channel
[14:20] AAA_awright: Because you depend on them and you can fork them
[14:20] AAA_awright: You can't fork a subtree :)
[14:21] hipsterslapfight: a_meteorite: and you can always swing for one of those $5k private github hosting deals :v
[14:21] Aikar: you can fork the upstream and then host it yourself when you NEED to fork it, then install from your fork

[18:39] Aikar: jerrysv: looks the same, but mongoskin is by a non english native speaker so the documentation is a bit hard to understand sometimes, but looks to least still have more docs than mongode does
[18:39] lauxley: i think the client can't connect to the server but i can't see why
[18:39] jerrysv: Aikar: i haven't looked at mongoskin, but i do use mongode in production -- seems pretty darned stable

[18:40] jerrysv: mkrecny: yes, we use replica sets -- just pass in an array and it just handles it
[18:40] Aikar: mongoskin is a futures layer ontop of -native, so it emulates the CLI syntax alot.

[18:58] CoverSlide: also, where is the socket.io stuff in the server?
[18:58] lauxley: CoverSlide: but it may not be the right answer, what do you mean ?
[18:59] CoverSlide: your server isn't running socket.io at all
[18:59] kersny has joined the channel

[18:59] lauxley: ?
[18:59] CoverSlide: ... no where did you assume that?

[19:00] lauxley: CoverSlide: hmm

[19:01] lauxley: so i need a socket.io server, not a node.js server ?

[21:01] isaacs: ee77ee: but really, you should also bug the author to update.

[21:56] ekryski: does anyone know if with everyauth using the password strategy if you can register a user from two separate routes?  For example I have /register but let's say I also have /demo both of which I want to register an account
