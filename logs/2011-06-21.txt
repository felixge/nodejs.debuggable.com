[02:09] ggg: simple node,js question about node-mongodb-native
[02:10] ggg: ive declared my db in my server,js, how can i use this same connected and authenticated db in another module??
[02:10] piscisaureus: sh1mmer: what do you mean "something is not right"?
[02:11] ggg: id like to insert something in a collection, but it says db is undefined, i tried exports.db when declaring my db, but it gave me an error
[02:11] harth has joined the channel
[02:11] marcello3d: ggg: you could make a file like db.js: exports.db = ...codetomakedb...
[02:12] marcello3d: then in other files: var db = require('./db').db
[02:12] cjm has joined the channel
[02:12] marcello3d: or if you want to make collection objects (this is what I do with mongolian deadbeef): exports.blog = db.collection("blog"); exports.users = db.collection("users");
[02:13] mjr_ has joined the channel
[02:13] marcello3d: then access it with: var db = require('./db'); ... use db.users and db.posts ...
[02:13] ggg: ok, so i want to initalize my db, when my server starts, if i  = require, will it be loaded, and then i can use it in another module??
[02:13] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[02:13] marcello3d: yea, the module is only loaded once
[02:13] marcello3d: then subsequent calls to require() reference the same object
[02:14] ggg: ok, thanks alot marcello, ill give it a shot
[02:14] ggg: node.js is really interesting
[02:15] _Sorensen: i'll say
[02:16] ggg: i keep reading it good for chat apps etc...but shouldnt it be good for normal http if its good for low latency apps??
[02:16] _Sorensen: its good for... EVERYTHING

[02:18] Nuck: I'm just having it hang at "Connecting to Mongo..."
[02:18] marcello3d: mongolian is much simpler
[02:18] Nuck: This code USED to work, so I imagine I fucked it up somewhere subtle.
[02:18] sh1mmer: Nuck: tried a packet sniffer?
[02:19] Nuck: sh1mmer: Ugh I'd rather not resort to that :/
[02:19] sh1mmer: e.g. is it sending anything to the database at all?
[02:19] _Sorensen: and i'm assuming you havn't updated the package?
[02:19] sh1mmer: Nuck: well I think I'm trying to establish if it's network conditions
[02:19] _Sorensen: in RE: to API changes
[02:19] xijhing: _Sorensen: what stack do you use for your chat app?
[02:20] marcello3d: that same code is like one or two lines in mongoliandb :) (depending on stylistic preference)
[02:20] _Sorensen: dnode/backbone/mongoose
[02:20] _Sorensen: as the primaries
[02:20] _Sorensen: and express
[02:20] Nuck: sh1mmer: I can access mongo via the CLI
[02:20] _Sorensen: just added accesskeys and happy.js form validation
[02:20] Nuck: Just not via Mongodb-native
[02:20] _Sorensen: working on the docs now :D
[02:20] Nuck: I don't believe anything has changed in the API
[02:20] Nuck: The example is the same
[02:20] jerrysv: isaacs: you happen to be around?

[02:46] sh1mmer: piscisaureus: any suggestions for how to wire this stream up to a JavaScript interface?
[02:46] sh1mmer: piscisaureus: or a starting point to check out
[02:47] piscisaureus: sh1mmer: is it actually okay to call into JS while v8 is taking a dump?

[02:49] fairwinds has joined the channel
[02:50] piscisaureus: hmm. I don't use stream much. If you just want to do a blocking write I guess c++ provides an easy stream to write to a file (ofstream?)
[02:51] piscisaureus: Other possible solution: buffer everything up in a malloced memory area, then create a SlowBuffer object to wrap it, pass the buffer object to some JS callback

[02:52] sh1mmer: piscisaureus: I guess this should be blocking

[02:53] luke` has joined the channel
[02:54] JoshC1 has joined the channel
[02:56] piscisaureus: I think it's as easy as
[02:56] piscisaureus: ostream output("dump.txt");
[02:56] piscisaureus: snapshot.serialize(output, kJSON);
[02:56] piscisaureus: output.close();
[02:56] piscisaureus: sh1mmer: but reading the v8 api I think it is okay to call JS while it is streaming snapshot data
[02:56] sh1mmer: piscisaureus: it is
[02:57] sh1mmer: piscisaureus: but I'm doing it the easy way
[02:57] sh1mmer: and then I'll make it suck less
[02:57] piscisaureus: that's good, always start doing things the easy way
[02:57] sh1mmer: especially since this is the longest time (this afternoon) I've worked on C++ in about a decade
[02:58] piscisaureus: heh :-)
[02:58] piscisaureus: start small
[02:58] piscisaureus: end up as a ry replacement

[03:02] Nuck: Anyone here know a good RubyBlue-esque JS syntax highlighting file for Nano?
[03:03] Nuck: Or will I hafta build it myself?
[03:04] MooGoo: just man up and use vim
[03:04] Nuck: fuck vim
[03:04] Aria: ACTION smirks.
[03:04] MooGoo: I'll pretend I didn't hear that
[03:05] Nuck: No offense, but I am a fan of usability.  And vim has the least usable interface I've ever seen.
[03:05] eggsby has joined the channel
[03:05] MooGoo: I wouldnt really point to nano/pico as a beacon of useability in text editors
[03:06] tbranyen: Nuck: Its an acquired interface
[03:06] marcello3d: I use intellij
[03:06] marcello3d: works great :D
[03:06] marcello3d: node.js support, too
[03:06] Aria: They satisfy the basic grid-of-characters usability.
[03:06] eggsby: So, I'm working on a silly node irc bot... using the node-irc library.  Any time I trigger a kick on a nick that isn't in the room it crashes the process, is there any way around this?
[03:06] eggsby: try/catch block doesn't seem to be doing the trick
[03:06] MooGoo: lol
[03:06] MooGoo: that sux
[03:07] eggsby: for some relevant code: http://pastie.org/2099407
[03:08] Aria: Looks like a bug -- node-irc is making an async call, and not handling the error, nor passing you the callback so you can handle it.
[03:08] Aria: So boom. Outside your part of the stack.
[03:09] eggsby: bl-bl-bleeeeding edge
[03:09] marcello3d: aria: actually this is an eventemitter error it looks like?
[03:09] marcello3d: someone's not calling foo.on('error', ... )
[03:09] Aria: Yeah, exactly.
[03:09] eggsby: oo!
[03:09] eggsby: so its me then
[03:10] MooGoo: where is ur bot
[03:10] eggsby:  http://github.com/eggsby/nousbot/
[03:10] marcello3d: yea, if you're ever given an emitter that you're calling foo.on('bar',...), you probably also want a foo.on('error',...) somewhere
[03:13] eggsby: that did the trick, thank you marcello3d 
[03:13] eggsby: (noob mistakes :3)

[03:53] marcello3d: your object serialization is not going to be the bottleneck

[04:10] Krytoss: sh1mmer: i actually had it as localhost:8888, but then in chrome debug it was showing the websocket as aiming at localhost:8888:8888
[04:10] hermanjunge: I want to learn how to set up headers in an http.request()
[04:11] sh1mmer: Krytoss: hm
[04:11] Krytoss: sh1mmer: so i think it's pulling down the port automatically
[04:11] Aria: Ah. Then set the headers in the options: {headers: {"Content-Type": "text/plain"]}
[04:11] tim_smart: options.headers['Content-Length'] = xxx
[04:11] hermanjunge: I know how to set up host, port, path... etc
[04:11] hermanjunge: great

[04:12] Krytoss: ah
[04:12] Krytoss: good idea i'll check that
[04:12] sh1mmer: Krytoss: I can't remember off the top of my head

[04:12] hermanjunge: but didn't understand till just now
[04:12] hermanjunge: thanks
[04:12] tim_smart: hermanjunge: Usually a good idea to check the docs before asking questions :)

[04:54] chrisdickinson: oh jeez
[04:54] chrisdickinson: what's buildOrderObserver.__proto__ look like, versus buildOrderObserver.prototype?
[04:54] tmzt_: hmm
[04:54] tmzt_: I'm using underscore to build my objects
[04:55] chrisdickinson: tmzt_: if it's not exactly the same then game.buildOrderObserver hasn't been initialized with ``new``
[04:55] tmzt_: okay
[04:55] tmzt_: let me add more context
[04:56] tmpvar: looks like game.buildOrderObserver is a `new Error()` ?

[05:09] tmzt_: I'm using initilize() as the constructor
[05:10] tmzt_: the big thing here was to add EventEmiiter, on the client I use Backbone.Events
[05:10] framlin: BuildObserver.prototype =EventEmitter(); is what you have to do at least
[05:10] tmzt_: it's the same code, I'm not sure what's going on
[05:10] chrisdickinson: (I still use `var Class = function() { Parent.call(this); }; Class.prototype = new Parent;` but i'm old-fashioned.
[05:10] tmzt_: EventEmiiter() ?
[05:10] tmzt_: oh
[05:10] chrisdickinson: framlin: err, BuildObserver.prototype = new EventEmitter()
[05:10] tmzt_: got it
[05:10] Pickley has joined the channel
[05:10] framlin: yep, you have to "initilize" the prototype - object
[05:10] tmzt_: Game.prototype = new EventEmitter;
[05:11] tmzt_: BuildOrderObserver.prototype = EventEmitter;
[05:11] tmzt_: not the same
[05:11] chrisdickinson: tmzt_: yes yes.
[05:11] framlin: sorry, new EventEmitter()
[05:11] framlin: the () is the point
[05:11] framlin: and the new
[05:11] chrisdickinson: `new` links it up. you don't need the `()`.
[05:12] tim_smart: tmzt_: function Emitter () { EventEmitter.call(this) } Emitter.prototype.__proto__ = EventEmitter.prototype
[05:12] framlin: if you use only = EventEmitter you assign only the Function-Delraration
[05:12] chrisdickinson: you can have them, but they're not necessary if it doesn't take arguments (which EE doesn't)
[05:12] tmzt_: right

[05:14] framlin: I prefee Object.create, too
[05:14] chrisdickinson: tmzt_: it'll be fine. buildOrderObserver is attached to game, which won't be gc'd until game is
[05:14] tim_smart: chrisdickinson: I don't like to overwrite the prototype
[05:15] _Sorensen: fuckin estatic i got docco working
[05:15] tmzt_: I know, I mean websocketObserver
[05:15] _Sorensen: sorry for the interuption
[05:15] MonsieurLu has left the channel
[05:15] tmzt_: it's a couple of levels of observers
[05:15] chrisdickinson: tim_smart: that or the aforementioned `F.prototype = new Something`, which i use the most. but if Object.create is around, i like it a lot.
[05:15] _Sorensen: should one feel joy in writing lengthy documentation above each method?
[05:15] tmzt_: tim_smart: I'm only overwritting the prototype in this case because I know the base is an eventemitter
[05:15] framlin: and you do not need any Function-Copying, if you use MY_CL.prototype.foo = function(){alert('bla')}
[05:16] tim_smart: chrisdickinson: As long as you reattach .constructor etc
[05:16] chrisdickinson: tim_smart: eeeh. i've not had a huge need for reattaching .constructor.

[05:21] tmzt_: at least on the client for now
[05:21] chrisdickinson: tim_smart: i'm worried that __proto__ will disappear someday; though it's not likely, it's not promised by any spec and it could die out
[05:21] Emmanuel__ has joined the channel
[05:22] chrisdickinson: tmzt_: cool -- yeah, i could see a really data-rich model needing something with less frills with backbone, maybe
[05:24] framlin: the advantage about using __proto__ = Parent.prototype is, that the "CTOR-Function" is not called. Thats usfull if you have to pass parameters to them and do not have them while "first run"
[05:26] framlin: but that seems the same with Child.prototype = Object.create(Parent.prototype)

[05:44] mikey_p: i'm not opposed to redis, it's just that I'm already using mongo, so I'd like to stick with it
[05:44] chrisdickinson: tim_smart: aaah. I've really never had that need, so it never came up.
[05:45] Nuck: mikey_p: Try gisting your code, might be something you missed that we might notice

[06:07] Tobsn: "pedophile: like being gay, but less acceptable."
[06:07] Nuck: And rule34 is usually a bit more reliable in making me gag.

[06:08] Tobsn: dude i was called ignorant by shittons of people for saying the statement "pedophile: like being gay, but less acceptable." is utterly disturbing
[06:08] Tobsn: man hehe..
[06:08] Tobsn: in so many ways...
[06:09] Nuck: I have no problem with people in their early 20's having attraction to people aged 17, and people 18-20 attracted to 16-year-olds
[06:09] Nuck: But 21 --> 4
[06:09] Nuck: That's fucking creepy.
[06:09] Nuck: Hell, ANYONE attracted to a 4-year-old is creepy.
[06:09] tuhoojabotti: I don't see how this is related though
[06:09] tmzt_: chrisdickinson: I've got it bound now, I'm sure this is wrong in buildOrder
[06:09] tuhoojabotti: Nuck: Parents? ;D
[06:09] tmzt_: since mongo doesn't care that makes sense
[06:10] Nuck: tuhoojabotti: I don't wanna be raped by my parents D:
[06:10] Tobsn: oh i dont even have problems with ~30 attracted to 16+... its not like they go out and try to rape them... and its not like those 16 year olds look like 16 year olds... but everything under 15-16 is just... that doesnt even look anywhere near attractive
[06:10] Nuck: Ewwwwwwww

[06:11] chrisdickinson: tmzt_: and console.log(this instanceof BuildOrder, this) in `buildOrder` gives you `true, {....}`?
[06:11] Nuck: Though I'm a bit biased towards laxer rules in this case, seeing as I like 16-year-old girls :P (it's not creepy, I'm only 17!)
[06:11] Tobsn: nuck, yeah and she, if its true, writes about being sexual attracted... i mean i try to be open minded but thats just wrong hehe

[06:12] Tobsn: nuck, i like 16 year old girls too if they are the right kind.. i mean i was 17 years once too and fucked a 16 year old... wasnt wrong at that time. but its not like i want to find a 16 year old and try to fuck her... hehe BIG difference. i cant even stand being around anyone under 20 because they annoy the shit ouf of me

[06:16] tmzt_: initialize isn't either, but it's called from the constructor
[06:16] tmzt_: this.initialize.apply(this); ??
[06:16] Nuck: Tobsn: Pretty fast
[06:16] Tobsn: k
[06:16] Nuck: Though it has some slower aspects
[06:16] Nuck: The resources take a bit

[06:18] Nuck: Tobsn: So you're making your own search engine?
[06:18] Tobsn: took long enought to build that whole thing as single page
[06:19] Tobsn: it uses the bing api and a bing/yahoo ad feed
[06:19] Nuck: ah
[06:19] tmzt_: chrisdickinson: something is messed up, but looking at the instance as dict doesn't help because it is correct
[06:19] Nuck: Bing sucks.
[06:19] Nuck: Worst.  Search. Ever.
[06:19] Skola: no way
[06:19] Tobsn: well its okay
[06:19] Tobsn: i like that they are very open
[06:20] Skola: their search api is better than google's as well

[06:26] chrisdickinson: actually, make that a console.error.
[06:26] chrisdickinson: (have it say anything at all -- 'wtf?', etc.)
[06:26] chrisdickinson: and then lemme know if my listener is going off before or after that log
[06:29] tmzt_: do you mean in the event handler or after it?
[06:29] tmzt_: after 150 would be in the event handler

[07:05] elliottcable: i.e. sitting in ~/Code/something and I `npm install Apricot`, it won’t install it in ~/node_modules?
[07:05] Nuck: Now it makes sense.
[07:05] elliottcable: Nuck: that’s fairly ironic
[07:05] Nuck: elliottcable: Hipster.
[07:05] isaacs: elliottcable: depends, but usually, yeah, it'll install to ./node_modules
[07:05] isaacs: elliottcable: it walks up until it finds a node_modules or a package.json, and if it doesn't find either, it installs it in cwd

[07:07] tmzt_: I don't want two copies of the object

[07:07] isaacs: elliottcable: global for cli bins, local for require()able modules

[07:17] elliottcable: my server’s still running it
[07:17] Nuck: 0.1.20 is fucking old.
[07:17] elliottcable: go have fun hacking into all the Node-y security flaws
[07:17] elliottcable: and 0.1.20 or 0.1.21 was the last time I read the docs
[07:17] Nuck: oh shit I remember reading a bunch of things about 0.1.18
[07:18] elliottcable: yeah, that was back when we still had asynchronous-by-default IO instead of asynchronous-only-if-you-ask-for-it I?o
[07:18] Nuck: elliottcable: Care to show me a snippet of what Node was like before CommonJS? :P
[07:18] elliottcable: I/O
[07:18] Nuck: It's still async-by-default
[07:18] elliottcable: which turned out to piss people off because OH NOESSZZZSZ they had to write CALLBACKS!?
[07:18] elliottcable: and then we lost it )=
[07:18] elliottcable: what?
[07:18] elliottcable: uh nahbitch
[07:18] Nuck: elliottcable: it's still async by default.
[07:18] elliottcable: is dat some `require(foo)` instead of `require(foo, function(foo){ … })` I see?
[07:19] elliottcable: or whutevs
[07:19] elliottcable: honestly I have no idea what’s going on now :x
[07:19] elliottcable: I know there’s npm now
[07:19] elliottcable: which I’m currently trying to learn, heh
[07:19] Nuck: elliottcable: NPM is WONDERFUL
[07:19] elliottcable: and CommonJS has taken over the fuckin’ world

[07:19] elliottcable: NPM? maybe.
[07:19] elliottcable: isaacs *is* pimp, afterall.
[07:19] Nuck: Trust me, you get used to both of the things.
[07:19] elliottcable: but CommonJS? No.
[07:19] elliottcable: CommonJS needs to die in a fire.
[07:19] elliottcable: made of acid.
[07:19] elliottcable: in HELL>
[07:19] elliottcable: HELL-ACID-FIRE.
[07:20] Nuck: elliottcable: CommonJS in Node is a lot subtler than most CommonJS implementations.
[07:20] elliottcable: that’s what it needs to die in.
[07:20] elliottcable: no, it’s really not.
[07:20] Nuck: It mostly just has the require()
[07:20] elliottcable: unless ryah back off on some of it.
[07:20] elliottcable: yeah, that’s the part I hate.
[07:20] elliottcable: it’s frickin’ ridic.
[07:20] Nuck: elliottcable: What did you use before? :O
[07:20] elliottcable: lol I’ve had this argument WAY too many times to care anymore.
[07:20] Nuck: Srsly
[07:20] elliottcable: Nuck: I wrote my own replacement
[07:20] Nuck: elliottcable... That's retarded.
[07:20] elliottcable: Nuck: and *nearly* convinced ryan to replace require() with it, way-back-when
[07:20] Nuck: Make your own way to load code?
[07:21] Nuck: elliottcable: I personally like the way node handles modules
[07:21] elliottcable: o_O
[07:21] elliottcable: yep

[07:22] elliottcable: heh, the long-exiled hermit returns …
[07:22] elliottcable: Nuck: that’s the point.
[07:22] elliottcable: Nuck: it’s *just* a way of resolving *files*
[07:22] elliottcable: Nuck: it in absolutely no way dictates what those files *contain*
[07:22] elliottcable: there are no “modules” when you used my `from`
[07:22] elliottcable: just folders full of files, and files full of JavaScript code.
[07:23] niftylettuce has joined the channel
[07:23] elliottcable: the files were akin to functions, if anything at all; you could `return` a value if you so desired (though you didn’t even have to do that)
[07:23] Nuck: elliottcable: Ry has done some things that resolve the packages a bit better, and the only thing you gotta do is export your shit
[07:23] Nuck: It's not that big a deal.

[11:18] tuhoojabotti: Like type=gallery|article|link
[11:18] tuhoojabotti: and it calls galleryInit or articleInit

[11:20] tuhoojabotti: Yeah
[11:20] tuhoojabotti: I guess I'll make a plugins object to store them :P
[11:21] framlin: maybe this[type+'Init'](data, article) depends on where they are used/declared
[11:21] tuhoojabotti: yeah
[11:21] tuhoojabotti: Exactly what I thought.
[11:21] tuhoojabotti: But perhaps it's better not make them to global scope. :D

[11:47] tuhoojabotti: 29px and 30px
[11:48] Tobsn: why is that thing now 1px larger
[11:48] Tobsn: that was fine a couple days ago

[11:58] mekwall: how is that?
[11:58] framlin: EventLoop?
[11:58] Tobsn: gcc?
[11:58] Lorentz: Depends on what you're doing.
[11:58] mekwall: benchmarking a http server
[11:59] framlin: non blocking
[11:59] Tobsn: ryah, there?
[11:59] mekwall: framlin: yes, but does that mean that it leverages all cores?
[11:59] mekwall: even though there's only once process
[11:59] mekwall: one*
[12:00] Tobsn: http://node.gd/
[12:00] framlin: no, afik its running only on one core
[12:00] framlin: but its not blocking, so it does not need to fork threads
[12:01] mekwall: I know that
[12:01] mekwall: but how come it peforms better with 4 cores then with 1? :D

[12:01] Lorentz: How are you benchmarking an http server?
[12:01] mekwall: Lorentz: there you go... didn't think about that ;)
[12:02] mekwall: locally... so probably apachebench using more cores
[12:02] framlin: ah .... no I get your point ... good question ;)
[12:02] mekwall: thats probably the explanaition
[12:02] mc_greeny has joined the channel
[12:02] mekwall: got about 2600 req/s with 1 core and 4400 with 4 cores
[12:02] Tobsn: yeah
[12:03] Tobsn: you can also not test locally
[12:03] Tobsn: that takes away all the problems
[12:03] mekwall: Tobsn: I'm merely testing the performance of node.js
[12:03] mekwall: not a real-life test
[12:03] mekwall: comparing it to other local tests
[12:03] mekwall: might not have any real use but to myself
[12:04] Bwen has joined the channel
[12:04] Tobsn: that still takes away latency etc.
[12:04] mekwall: yeah, but I'm not benchmarking the connection
[12:05] mekwall: benchmarking a simple http server that outputs "Hello world" ... and I'm pretty sure I'll never have a site running with only that anyways
[12:05] roidrage: and that's why your benchmark is pretty much useless
[12:05] Tobsn: no youre not
[12:05] mekwall: roidrage: not to me, when I am comparing it to other local tests
[12:06] Tobsn: youre benchmaking how fast node.js can send out requests from localhost to localhost hehe
[12:06] mekwall: compared to...
[12:06] roidrage: your other local tests are also pointless
[12:06] svenlito has joined the channel
[12:06] mekwall: which is the important part here :)
[12:06] Tobsn: youre really not testing it
[12:06] roidrage: the numbers you're getting don't have any meaning, either way. you'd be foolish to conclude anything from them
[12:06] mekwall: roidrage: as I said, they only have a use for myself... proving how fast node.js is
[12:06] Tobsn: they are always only for yourself
[12:06] Tobsn: and it doesnt show you how fast node.js is
[12:07] mekwall: so why are you guys arguing? :)
[12:07] Tobsn: that way youre just finding out how fast the kernel is

[12:09] elliottcable: well, first off, how do I make it work with `require()`?
[12:09] elliottcable: doesn’t `require()` only look in ~/node_modules?

[12:11] xerox: exactly
[12:11] mekwall: Tobsn: wth are you on about?

[12:12] elliottcable: ACTION is working
[12:12] Tobsn: you think that would be a 1:1 comparison?
[12:12] mekwall: Tobsn: you just read trolling for dummies didn't you...
[12:12] Tobsn: 500 req/sec with php and 2000 req/sec with node.js
[12:13] Tobsn: mekwall, well you think you know it better so why would you keep asking?
[12:13] roidrage: aw, you guys are so cute
[12:13] Tobsn: hehe
[12:13] mekwall: can't compare it with php

[12:13] tuhoojabotti: afaik

[13:23] elliottcable: why can’t setTimeout do the same when its argument is zero?

[13:30] dtan: i only know what bubbling is on the frontend
[13:30] tim_smart: elliottcable: Depends what you are working with. Streams usually emit 'error' events, callbacks usually have (error) as the first argument
[13:30] tim_smart: error is null if there was no error
[13:31] elliottcable: “Error events are treated as a special case in node.”

[13:31] tim_smart: Unless you catch it with a process.on('uncaughtException')
[13:31] elliottcable: so if there’s zero listeners registered on an EventEmitter instance for the key 'error'
[13:32] elliottcable: and then an 'error' event is generated in some way,
[13:32] elliottcable: Node automatically crashes and prints a stack trace?
[13:32] elliottcable: #amireadingthisright
[13:32] tim_smart: Ya
[13:32] elliottcable: and that’s true for *any* EventEmitter instance, not just special core-ones from things like Server?

[13:34] elliottcable: well, that understood, I still don’t grasp what “bubbling” is.
[13:34] elliottcable: I gather it’s good practice if you’re writing modular code, so …
[13:34] tim_smart: Where does it mention bubbling
[13:34] elliottcable: not in the docs
[13:34] elliottcable: I’m assuming it’s an idiomatic practice involving error handling
[13:35] elliottcable: I really don’t know, I just hear the word bandied about :x
[13:35] tim_smart: It just means passing errors back to the front-most UI

[13:44] pen has joined the channel
[13:45] jonaslund: BUT.. in the future(TM) it will be fast (V8 has optimizations for dense Int/Float buffers to speed up WebGL and those improvements will trickle down to node.js Buffers eventually)
[13:46] dall: guys, do you know a SIP module for nodejs ? (to make normal calls)
[13:46] dall: (make/receive)
[13:46] Jalava_: is this bug, arguments is not array of parameters but Object with keys starting from 0 containing parameters
[13:46] jonaslund: Jalava_: no it's according to spec
[13:46] Jalava_: problem is that you cannot use .apply() with arguments directly
[13:47] Jalava_: because apply expects array and not assoc array
[13:47] Jalava_: tested on chrome js and it gives arguments as array and not object
[13:48] jonaslund: the EcmaScript standard says that apply should accept an array or arguments object
[13:48] ngs has joined the channel
[13:48] jonaslund: (Just checked)
[13:48] Jalava_: hmm, then apply bugs
[13:49] jonaslund: I'm pretty sure i've done code passing stuff
[13:49] ksheurs has joined the channel

[13:50] Jalava_: ah this, arguments
[13:50] adambeynon has joined the channel
[13:51] jonaslund: yeah you always specify this
[13:51] jonaslund: first
[13:51] jonaslund: then arguments

[13:51] willwhite has joined the channel
[13:51] Jalava_: hmm, looking at our code we did that, strange
[13:51] dtan: i know in the browser when i make an alias for console methods

[13:52] dtan: i always pass in the console as the first argument, not this
[13:52] akashiraffee has joined the channel
[13:52] jonaslund: hij1nx: whatever is a valid object and is passed as the this parameter will become the this reference in the called function.

[16:06] elliottcable: oh, you’re talking about browserify

[16:07] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: using cluster, need to run a background process (something like cron in JS) to process stuff every couple of hours.

[16:15] DTrejo: ah
[16:15] adambeynon has joined the channel
[16:15] hunterloftis: DTrejo: since I want that worker to only have one single instance, but be bound to a cluster, if that makes sense.
[16:16] DTrejo: mm
[16:16] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis yeah that's a tough call you lose redundancy by doing that as well
[16:16] tjholowaychuk: you could just check env.CLUSTER_ID or w/e I have for workers
[16:16] tjholowaychuk: can't remember right now
[16:17] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: Yeah I know what you mean. I guess I could just see if CLUSTER_ID === 0 and only launch the cron process in that case
[16:17] tjholowaychuk: yup
[16:18] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: I don't understand the "isMaster" and "isWorker" stuff in the cluster API docs. It looks like they're being called on the cluster object in the root server.js, in which case... wouldn't it always be master? A master that spawns workers?

[16:44] w3rdness: You can't get around the fact that WebGL lets a website control the graphics driver in a way which is much too direct for comfort. The central problem is the poor quality of driver code compared to OS code. If these were of equal quality, then indeed this would be no more dangerous than a JVM. [EDIT: and for extra danger, the driver code generally runs at elevated privilege.] You can presumably exploit a hole in the OS by e
[16:44] w3rdness: xecuting something in a JVM, but that's been an extremely rare exploit because of the high quality of the JVM and OS code in the relevant parts of their interface. This thing opens a huge attack surface against much more vulnerable code. Driver code is buggy, usually prematurely released in a rush to market, and deliberately closed and obscured. Maybe the answer is to make that code better across all the graphics companies,

[19:18] jmoyers has joined the channel
[19:18] kmiyashiro: is express unit testeded?
[19:18] baudehlo: defeated: ah yeah - so to get it to use the search domains you have to use the ares_search() API. Node uses the ares_query() API.
[19:18] tjholowaychuk: IMO you can't really have too many, HOWEVER you need to be careful of volatile apis, dont go testing shit that wont remain similar otherwise it can be verrrry annoying
[19:18] tjholowaychuk: kmiyashiro yeah
[19:18] tjholowaychuk: and tests are no excuse to ignore more robust manual testing etc
[19:18] Skola: alright, thanks for the suggestion
[19:19] Skola: How do I establish what to test for?
[19:19] Skola: dw, I'm gonna read about it, but is there a methodology?
[19:19] Skola: spec writing?
[19:19] Skola: common sense?
[19:20] Skola: is there consensus on this?
[19:20] tjholowaychuk: write some public api code in the test
[19:20] tjholowaychuk: it will fail
[19:20] tjholowaychuk: implement it
[19:20] tjholowaychuk: and have it pass
[19:20] tjholowaychuk: though typically I code the first 1/3 of a project with no tests to establish an api
[19:21] chrisdickinson: Skola: I like to do as tjholowaychuk said; with the addition that you should be testing what happens when the api is used correctly, as well as what happens when the api is used improperly (verifiable error cases)
[19:21] tjholowaychuk: yeah totally
[19:21] Skola: alright, are there certain things I should always be aware of for simple functions?
[19:22] zmbmartin: tjholowaychuk: what do you use to test web apps in express (expresso, tobi) anything else?
[19:22] tjholowaychuk: it is difficult to maintain 100% coverage, soooooo many possibilities but I find personally at least unit tests and acceptance tests are usually the most important
[19:22] tjholowaychuk: but it really depends on the project
[19:22] chrisdickinson: yeah

[19:22] baudehlo: TEST ALL THE THINGS!
[19:22] andrenkov has joined the channel
[19:22] chrisdickinson: i like high level tests with a few mid-level private api tests.
[19:22] Skola: alright tj
[19:22] tjholowaychuk: stylus has only acceptance tests for example
[19:22] tjholowaychuk: 9k lines of them, but no unit tests
[19:22] chrisdickinson: nothing that relies on internal structures, really. 
[19:23] chrisdickinson: oh! importantly: if you have a bug in your code that gets reported to you (via gh issues, etc): make a test case for it!
[19:23] tjholowaychuk: and our app mainly has acceptance tests, because our components all have their own tests
[19:23] Skola: is there something you could recommend for me to read?
[19:23] Skola: either code or prose
[19:24] defeated: Just want to throw this out there, which doesn't really cover how to test, but more how to write testable code: http://misko.hevery.com/code-reviewers-guide/, it's written with java in mind, but the concepts apply anywhere. Reading and understanding this really made a huge impact on how I design my code to make sure it's as easy to test as possible
[19:24] zmbmartin: what are the best unit and acceptance test libraries
[19:24] Skola: thanks for the link defeated
[19:24] zmbmartin: I really need to do more testing
[19:25] defeated: unit test libraries there are lots, expresso, vows, jasmine
[19:25] defeated: it depends on your preferences
[19:25] zmbmartin: what for acceptance?
[19:26] defeated: acceptance tests, zombie is the best I've found, but it's somewhat hampered by its dependence on jsdom
[19:26] Skola: tjholowaychuk: what do you use for testing? I could just check on github, but I'd like to hear some context
[19:26] dmose has joined the channel
[19:27] chrisdickinson: if you like BDD, vows or jasmine is probably the best -- if you like writing tests like "When I do X, Y should do Z"

[19:27] tjholowaychuk: Skola depends on the case
[19:27] tjholowaychuk: cluster, stylus, nib, node-canvas, and others all have their own little test frameworks
[19:27] chrisdickinson: (for that case)
[19:27] tjholowaychuk: for specific needs
[19:27] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: does cluster do any kind of file locking?
[19:27] chrisdickinson: (disclaimer: i like straight-up unit tests better than BDD-style frameworks)
[19:27] baudehlo: what test library has nice output (like perl's Test::More stuff)?
[19:27] tbranyen: in case two processes are hitting the same file
[19:27] tjholowaychuk: tbranyen what file
[19:27] baudehlo: I tried node-tap, but it expects you to use prove (from perl) to run the tests...
[19:27] Skola: ok but for small libs would you recommend a custom framework?
[19:27] baudehlo: which just seemed wrong.
[19:27] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: any file
[19:27] wadey: i like the output and style of whisky, but it is still a little new
[19:27] tjholowaychuk: tbranyen nope, cluster has nothing to do with that
[19:27] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: if you use readFile/writeFile for instance
[19:28] wadey: and some things don't work right
[19:28] chrisdickinson: Skola: it'd probably be best to go with an existing framework.
[19:28] baudehlo: hah.
[19:28] chrisdickinson: Skola: I like expresso a lot in that case.
[19:28] baudehlo: a test library that isn't well tested?

[19:28] Skola: it's good, but I don't know enough about testing to settle on anything yet
[19:28] tjholowaychuk: who cares
[19:28] tjholowaychuk: as long as you have tests

[19:29] tjholowaychuk: I used to like all the fancy crap but I've grown out of that
[19:29] defeated: yep, definitely having tests is the big win
[19:29] tbranyen: ryah: does node do anything with file locking, couldn't see in the source
[19:29] chrisdickinson: and helps you debug the most when it breaks (which it will break.)
[19:29] defeated: other than that use whatever makes you the most productive

[19:35] defeated: when your actively working in a code base, tests are more of a fail safe, but when you're new to it, or coming back it without the whole thing mapped in your head, they can be a life saver
[19:35] chrisdickinson: my mindset when i'm working on libraries is that it's not really a public project until there are tests and docs for the entire thing. until that point, my library is just a sketch of what could be useful.
[19:35] tjholowaychuk: refactoring

[19:36] defeated: yeah, refactoring without tests is terrifying ;)
[19:36] tjholowaychuk: oh god yeah

[19:37] chrisdickinson: defeated: true :) but until i've got tests, i feel like i'm just building castles in the sky, yanno?

[20:00] tjholowaychuk: istill think coffeescript should be for php
[20:00] seawise: blueadept - what have your written on Node?
[20:00] tjholowaychuk: php is way worse than js
[20:00] bazookatooth: i dont see why it should exist for anything, really.

[20:00] chrisdickinson: ACTION likes coffeescript
[20:00] tjholowaychuk: that's the one language I would take the compile hit for
[20:01] seawise: blueadept - can you give examples?
[20:01] tjholowaychuk: if i ever had to look at it again that is
[20:01] chrisdickinson: admittedly, it took me a while to warm up to it
[20:01] blueadept: seawise: just stuff for myself, side projects, weekend hacks
[20:01] blueadept: nothing big
[20:01] blueadept: not like tj over here
[20:01] coreb: php's pretty popular though, even if it's so "bad"
[20:01] chrisdickinson: is there a big taboo against releasing a node library that's written in coffeescript but compiled down?
[20:01] tjholowaychuk: chrisdickinson it's fine i guess as long as you accept regular js patches
[20:01] tjholowaychuk: which i imagine would be very annoying
[20:02] martyziff has joined the channel
[20:02] tjholowaychuk: i think it hurts the community in general
[20:02] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: how so?

[20:03] blueadept: just started using nowjs today
[20:03] Shinuza: Coffee script is cool
[20:03] blueadept: one word: awesome
[20:03] chrisdickinson: this library will probably be doubly contentious since it's written in coffeescript and it's an ORM :\
[20:03] Shinuza: But careful making a standard by usage
[20:03] Shinuza: Making it
[20:03] Shinuza: Same thing for js extensions

[20:07] mikey_p|afk: there is simply no way that coffee script can exist without splitting the community and development

[20:08] Shinuza: There is an effort to propose part of coffee script syntax as js next
[20:08] tjholowaychuk: unfortunately yes
[20:08] blueadept: really
[20:08] blueadept: so all my code is going to break?
[20:08] tjholowaychuk: all i want is regexp.exec(str, offset)
[20:09] tjholowaychuk: but people are too busy with stupid syntax crap
[20:09] chrisdickinson: blueadept: no, it would sit nicely on top of existing js syntax.
[20:09] blueadept: well that's not totally bad i guess
[20:09] simenbrekken has joined the channel
[20:09] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: have you used coffeescript much yet?
[20:09] tjholowaychuk: wouldn't say much but yeah
[20:09] chrisdickinson: i ask, because i was basically of the same opinion until i broke down and tried it
[20:09] tjholowaychuk: not sure how you classify much
[20:10] tjholowaychuk: it has some good parts
[20:10] tjholowaychuk: but those parts are far less than unique
[20:10] chrisdickinson: writing a medium-sized project, i guess, would be how i'd qualify it
[20:10] gf3: tjholowaychuk: what about →
[20:10] gf3: :D
[20:10] konobi: if i wanted to screw up my ability to debug easily, i'd just pipe my JS code through google closure

[20:32] hassox has joined the channel
[20:33] creationix: now, if you were ok with a proxy, then the master process could be the vhost proxy and individual node servers could serve each domain
[20:33] flou has joined the channel
[20:33] jmoyers: wait, whats the problem with putting two domains on the same process?
[20:33] creationix: jmoyers: it's just less secure and robust
[20:33] mikeal has joined the channel
[20:33] creationix: if that's ok then it's ok
[20:33] jmoyers: i do it for 3-4 static sites
[20:33] hunterloftis: weird issue... using cluster to start up a server - that server does require('tick')(server) - tick.js does server.on('close') and process.on('exit'), but neither gets called when ctrl+c shuts down the actual server.
[20:34] jmoyers: seems to work out
[20:34] creationix: jmoyers: yeah, static sites are a case where it's perfectly fine
[20:34] sh1mmer: jmoyers: it's slightly more robust/secure for static content because of the work load
[20:34] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: SIGINT signals the children with SIGKILL
[20:34] Nuck has joined the channel
[20:35] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: thanks, I'll listen for that...
[20:35] tjholowaychuk: though you should get "close" for the server still
[20:35] dall: sh1mmer, why isnot raccomended?
[20:35] creationix: btw, I made a pure js implementation of nextTick last night (for the browser) https://gist.github.com/1037316
[20:35] tjholowaychuk: but only the object returned from cluster()
[20:35] tjholowaychuk: not the http server
[20:35] sh1mmer: dall: you put all the domains in the same memory
[20:35] Aphelion has joined the channel
[20:35] Aphelion has joined the channel
[20:35] sh1mmer: so if someone can exploit one site somehow they could get access to the others
[20:36] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: the connect/express server is passing itself to tick.js ... so cluster -> app.js -> tick.js(app)
[20:36] creationix: dall: if one site crashes, they all crash.  They are all on the same cpu core, they all are in the same vm heap sharing the same limit
[20:36] sh1mmer: more than that if one site is slow then it affects the others
[20:36] sh1mmer: the event loop can be fragile
[20:36] creationix: and security issues may arise if they don't mutually trust eachother
[20:36] dall: shit
[20:36] brettgoulder has joined the channel
[20:36] dall: so any advices ?
[20:36] jmoyers: whats the use case dall?
[20:36] dall: better to use nginx apache or others?
[20:36] sh1mmer: dall: run a couple of processes
[20:36] jmoyers: you haven't given any cotnext
[20:37] shinuza: dall: you can use nginx upfront
[20:37] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: process.on('SIGKILL') doesn't get triggered either :/
[20:37] creationix: actually, using unique v8 contexts for each site goes a ways to help the security issue
[20:37] sh1mmer: creationix: hey if you wanted to do a js bbq with drinking

[20:37] simenbrekken has joined the channel
[20:37] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis you can't register an action with SIGKILL
[20:37] jmoyers: it .. is possible
[20:37] creationix: sh1mmer: ahh, but I don't *want* drinking
[20:37] jmoyers: but depends entirely on your needs
[20:37] jmoyers: if they are dynamic PRODUCT sites or some such
[20:37] creationix: thanks though
[20:37] sh1mmer: creationix: bah
[20:37] dall: but not raccomended
[20:37] sh1mmer: haha
[20:37] jmoyers: or high traffic sites
[20:37] jmoyers: then its not a good idea
[20:38] dall: ok
[20:38] junkee[]: wuhuuu! I'm playing a song using gstreamer in JS! :)
[20:38] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: Hm. this process never gets killed though. It's got a setInterval that just logs a line... even after shutting down cluster, no more http://localhost, it keeps on setInterval logging...
[20:38] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis is it one of the workers?
[20:38] dall: ot of curiosity
[20:39] konobi: hunterloftis: SIGKILL is uncatchable, the kernel will kill the process immediately... if you want something to capture, try SIGTERM
[20:39] dall: createServer() doens't start async "process"
[20:39] dall: ?
[20:39] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: yes, it's the worker with process.env.CLUSTER_WORKER === '0'
[20:39] dall: why if a website is slow it also the other will be slow?
[20:39] hunterloftis: konobi: thanks
[20:39] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis I could have SIGINT send a different signal, doesn't matter much for that one
[20:39] creationix: dall: no, it just registers callbacks
[20:40] creationix: dall: it's all the same event loop
[20:40] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis right right, i remember what you are doing now
[20:40] xandrews has joined the channel
[20:40] creationix: the same process can listen on multiple ports, or even multiple ip addresses or multiple domains
[20:40] creationix: but then it's the same event loop
[20:40] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: It's weird because the actual process/server does get shut down and restarted, etc... but the setInterval just keeps trucking, hah
[20:40] tjholowaychuk: yup
[20:40] dall: creationix, so if i have a website with a big loop..it can't accept more then one http connections?
[20:40] tjholowaychuk: because the worker dies
[20:40] tjholowaychuk: doesn't mean it's child does
[20:41] konobi: hunterloftis: well, you gotta clearInterval =0)
[20:41] shinuza: actually if you kill the worker explicitly it leaves a zombie process
[20:41] tjholowaychuk: orphaned yes
[20:41] creationix: dall: do you understand how the reactor pattern / event loop works?
[20:41] hunterloftis: konobi: that's what I'm trying to do, but I'm not getting any 'close' events or process 'exit' signals ;)
[20:41] skm has joined the channel
[20:41] konobi: hunterloftis: SIGCHLD?
[20:41] _Sorensen has joined the channel
[20:41] creationix: dall: handling multiple connections is the strength of this architecture
[20:42] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis cluster(sever).on('close') is the only one you will (should) get
[20:42] dall: creationix, no, could you give me a link to understand how it works?
[20:42] tjholowaychuk: though like I said SIGINT doesn't need to be so harsh
[20:42] tjholowaychuk: I could signal the workers with SIGTERM
[20:42] dall: yes i know it can handles thousand of connections
[20:42] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: thanks, I'll mess with that, I can modify the signal to SIGTERM right now and see if that helps
[20:43] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: I'm wondering what I'm missing with 'close' though
[20:43] creationix: dall: the reason it can do that is because it doesn't have to spawn a thread of process for each new connection
[20:43] tjholowaychuk: it's gotta be in the master process
[20:43] creationix: dall: and it can hold on to the connection for indefinite amounts of time because the connection doesn't ever block the loop for long
[20:43] creationix: dall: but the event loop is single threaded and can only service one callback at a time
[20:44] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: At this level, I don't (think) I have access to the cluster object. cluster('app') -> then app creates a server, which then goes to tick(server)... so tick has access to server, but not cluster
[20:44] creationix: dall: so the more sites you put on the same loop, the slower it gets since all the events are being handled one at a time
[20:44] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis yeah that sounds correct
[20:44] dall: creationix, ooh ok, make sense....right
[20:44] creationix: dall: and if any single callback misbehaves, then the entire thing goes to crap
[20:45] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: I'll read up on this though. Since I'm not sure about what you mean by being the master process (other than possibly having id == 0) I think I just don't understand the master/workers thing enough
[20:45] dtan: creationix: so if there are a bunch of requests on one site (and say it's only one site running on the node.js instance) wouldn't htat mean that the site would slow down with the more connections to it?
[20:45] creationix: dtan: of course, any architecture will get slower the more load you put on it
[20:45] dall: creationix, but the problem could happen only with ONE site......if one callback "does a lot of things" It can slow the entire website, right?
[20:45] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: coworker just made an example showing node issues without having file locking :-/
[20:45] tbranyen: this is something i assumed happened under the hood
[20:46] tjholowaychuk: nope
[20:46] tjholowaychuk: just like anytihng else you just have to be aware of what you are doing in parallel
[20:46] shinuza: creationix: I'm guessing how to node is written in node :)
[20:46] shinuza: but did you write it from scratch
[20:46] dtan: creationix: then at what point would the load be, typically to see noticable slow down?
[20:46] shinuza: or is it something existing?
[20:47] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: wasn't that the point of using "single threaded" systems?
[20:47] jmoyers: uh
[20:47] tbranyen: to avoid shit like this
[20:47] dmcquay has joined the channel
[20:47] tjholowaychuk: well not really
[20:47] tjholowaychuk: that doesn't help with I/O related conflicts
[20:47] jmoyers: look, its not like things just magically slow down -- there are plenty of benchamarks out there that show thousands of concurrent connections.
[20:47] jmoyers: if you're doing IO, you aren't blocking the event loop
[20:47] jmoyers: this means files, network, etc
[20:47] jmoyers: its only if you're doing something like a tight loop, or some long winded calculations
[20:47] tjholowaychuk: tbranyen: you dont have all the shared memory bullshit with threads though
[20:47] bene has joined the channel
[20:47] tjholowaychuk: which is nice
[20:47] jmoyers: in those cases you move it off into another process
[20:48] jmoyers: single threaded doesn't means its not using a worker pool in the background to handle IO -- it is
[20:48] dall: as long i understand the reason....the result is: that node could handles a lot of connections BUT if a callback usend on the process is heavy it slow down the entire system? .... wrong ?
[20:48] jmoyers: its that the main javascript context is single threaded
[20:48] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: hmmm maybe providing some kind of abstracted method for locking then in fs
[20:49] caiges has joined the channel
[20:49] jmoyers: define "heavy"
[20:49] sjbreen has joined the channel
[20:49] shinuza: anyone has experience with a nodejs blog?
[20:49] jmoyers: if you are reading files off disk, no
[20:49] tjholowaychuk: tbranyen what are you doing that is causing issues?
[20:49] jmoyers: if you are adding + 1 to a variable 100,000,000 times, yes
[20:49] dall: i don't know....i mean....many loops, many connections to DB
[20:49] jmoyers: you are mixing problem sets -- loops and database connections are different
[20:49] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: we were just discussing node and it came up: https://github.com/sbisbee/nodeFlockPOC
[20:49] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: From within a cluster server instance, is there a way to tell if that server is the master? I see 'isMaster' but server.isMaster === undefined here
[20:49] tbranyen: he countered with that
[20:49] jmoyers: databases imply you are going out to the network to grab data from a different server -- this does NOT block
[20:50] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis cluster = cluster(app).listen(...); cluster.isMaster
[20:50] tbranyen: although he was only able to prove it with multiple node processes
[20:50] dall: but the concept is correct?  accepts many connections but with only one thread if there is an heavy callback it slow donw all
[20:50] jmoyers: as soon as you hit a point that would otherwise block on input/output (from network, disk, etc), its handled out of band
[20:50] dall: no?
[20:50] creationix: shinuza: howto.no.de?
[20:50] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis there are env vars as well
[20:50] mkrecny has joined the channel
[20:50] tbranyen: which i guess could happen with cluster
[20:50] shinuza: creationix: yes, that was my question earlier, was it written from scratch?
[20:51] jmoyers: yes, if you do  while(true){ ; } in one of your request handlers, it will block.
[20:51] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: wouldn't cluster always be master?
[20:51] shinuza: or using something that already exist?
[20:51] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis nope
[20:51] fairwinds has joined the channel
[20:51] dall: jmoyers, i have to wait a database response....so is not the same things?
[20:51] jmoyers: no, it is not the same thing
[20:51] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis: that same file is executed in the workers as well
[20:51] creationix: dall: in node, you can't wait for io in a blocking way
[20:51] kruckenb has joined the channel
[20:51] creationix: if you did, the event loop wouldn't work
[20:51] tjholowaychuk: hunterloftis which allows cluster(server).listen() to work
[20:52] creationix: pure CPU things are allowed to block because they are relatively cheap
[20:52] reid has joined the channel
[20:52] creationix: but waiting on I/O is extremely expensive in comparison
[20:52] hunterloftis: tjholowaychuk: I think I just need to read through cluster's source to actually understand what it's doing
[20:52] tjholowaychuk: tbranyen i dont get it, of course you would have different results with that
[20:52] tjholowaychuk: it's not ordered
[20:52] mkultra329 has joined the channel
[20:52] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: i guess the idea would be if node was employing file locking that wouldn't happen?
[20:52] tjholowaychuk: why not just not do that
[20:52] tjholowaychuk: lol
[20:52] dall: creationix, perfect.... so if i only have .html file....i can use readFile (async) so i could have 100 websites on node
[20:52] dall: no?
[20:53] creationix: dall: so, for the db example, you would start the db query, and give it a callback to be fired when the query returned.  Then you would stop blocking and the event loop would service other stuff while waiting
[20:53] dall: if it always async....i don't think it make node slow
[20:53] dall: ok
[20:53] creationix: there are no hard rules except don't block on I/O
[20:53] konobi: dall: go look at ryah's slides from jsconf.eu 2009
[20:54] creationix: other than that, all work does block the CPU a little and it eventually adds up the more work you put on it
[20:54] jmoyers: and then you use something like cluster ;-)
[20:54] creationix: it depends entirely on just how expensive the work is and how fast you need it to return
[20:54] creationix: static sites in particular are easy because they often don't have internal state
[20:54] konobi: dall: http://jsconf.eu/2009/video_nodejs_by_ryan_dahl.html
[20:55] creationix: then you can actually spawn several identical processes that share the load across CPUs
[20:55] tbranyen: tjholowaychuk: well honestly its never been an issue for me, and i know less than most about file locking
[20:55] sonnym has joined the channel
[20:55] creationix: cluster is great for this
[20:55] dall: can i not use cluster? it will use all the cores no? and then.....i could start more then one node process no?
[20:55] tbranyen: didn't know if that was something that could be added
[20:55] shinuza: it's important to understand the differences between I/O bound ops and CPU bound ops
[20:55] creationix: and if you app had some internal state, it could be stored in a shared redis db that all the nodes have access to
[20:56] dall: yes correct
[20:56] goatslacker has joined the channel
[20:56] creationix: but going back to virtual hosts, they are no different from different routes in a single http app
[20:56] creationix: it's just more work with it's own handler
[20:56] creationix: a single app with 100 different routes is the same as an app with 100 different virtual hosts
[20:57] dall: creationix, but what do you think about cluster and spawn more then one process? i think it's the same....i can block (Example) nginx to use MAX 3 process.... so it's equale to have: node app.js - node app.js - node app.js no?
[20:57] hassox has joined the channel
[20:57] creationix: dall: I don't understand your question
[20:57] dall: creationix, fuck my english :-D
[20:57] dall: creationix, i mean...
[20:58] creationix: nginx is a lot like node when doing static files btw
[20:58] dall: creationix, nginx doens't spawn 10000 process as a request arrive to the server......on the configuration we can set how many child to start.... so my questions is, what is the difference between
[20:59] dall: nginx 3 processes and
[20:59] dall: node app.js
[20:59] dall: node app.js
[20:59] dall: node app.js
[20:59] dall: ?
[20:59] Nakamura has joined the channel
[20:59] dall: it's the same thing i think no?
[20:59] dall: there are 3 node processes started individually
[20:59] dall: no?
[20:59] creationix: dall: three seperate node servers can't be listening to the same port
[20:59] dtan: what would be an ideal set up be if running a node based site with a high volume of users at once ?
[20:59] creationix: but using cluster, 3 child processes can share the paren't port
[21:00] catshirt has joined the channel
[21:00] creationix: cluster is really good for this kind of stuff and it's not a proxy
[21:00] tjholowaychuk: yeah cluster doesn't behave as a proxy
[21:00] dall: creationix, i know i can proxy to them no
[21:00] dall: ?
[21:00] creationix: right, the other option is to have a node process per site and have a reverse proxy
[21:00] dall: ah ok
[21:01] creationix: when going the cluster route, you don't know which process will get each request
[21:01] creationix: it's whoever is free when the request comes in
[21:01] creationix: so it's best to not keep much state in the process
[21:01] dall: creationix, or start 10 node processes and use nginx that server one of these each time (round robin) no?
[21:01] creationix: dall: right, then you're using nginx as a proxy
[21:02] creationix: but it's best to not proxy if you can get away with it
[21:02] creationix: less layers = good
[21:02] dall: creationix, you are right....so the solution is only the cluster
[21:02] creationix: websockets in particular are very hard to proxy properly
[21:02] dall: becuase all the website must to listen to 80 port
[21:03] creationix: so the options are: 1 - a single process listening on port 80, 2 - multiple identical processes sharing port 80, 3 - multiple different processes behind a proxy
[21:04] dall: th point number 2 do you mean to use cluster module ?
[21:05] creationix: dall: I'd recommend cluster.  It's not technically required, but it sure makes it a lot easier
[21:06] seawise: hey, who is working with Node.js on daily job?
[21:06] seawise: seems Node.js is a developer thing
[21:06] seawise: and employers still not interested in Node.js devs
[21:06] dall: creationix, but could i choose how many cluister to create at the beginning?
[21:06] dall: or it create max N cluster as the core of the server ?
[21:06] tjholowaychuk: dall cluster(app).set('workers, 2) etc
[21:07] dall: cool!
[21:07] tjholowaychuk: missed a quote
[21:07] dall: so i can create 100 cluster for 100 website :-D eheheh
[21:07] tjholowaychuk: baha
[21:07] creationix: seawise: there are sure interested here in the bay area
[21:07] tjholowaychuk: probably dont want to
[21:07] tjholowaychuk: but you could lol
[21:07] creationix: a year ago there were no jobs, but now there seem to be many
[21:08] seawise: it's good to hear
[21:08] creationix: dall: right, but each of the 100 cluster nodes will be serving all 100 sites each
[21:08] asobrasil has left the channel
[21:08] creationix: also, it's generally not useful to have more cluster nodes than cpu cores
[21:08] dall: cluster as fisically spawd node processes? (shit this question is written very bad i think) :-D 
[21:09] shapeshe1 has joined the channel
[21:09] dall: creating one moment i try to explain....
[21:09] seawise: what typical projects solved w/ Node.js employers want?
[21:09] dall: we have 10 websites
[21:09] dall: and then create 2 clusters..............ok
[21:10] creationix: seawise: it varies, everything from traditional web apps to infrastructure parts to mobile development on webos
[21:10] tjholowaychuk: dall you'll want at least 2 in production
[21:10] tjholowaychuk: ideally more for redundancy
[21:10] creationix: tjholowaychuk: do you use cluster for learnboost stuff?
[21:10] creationix: tjholowaychuk: I mean in data based apps
[21:10] dall: now, if one website is taking more time because it has a lot of loops etc etc.....another cluster will be used at the same time (if there are free cores) or like a thread if all the cores are working.......right?
[21:11] TheFuzzball has joined the channel
[21:11] seawise: sure it varies, websites on Node? hmm, APIs? real-time apps?
[21:11] TooTallNate: creationix: Ya, we use cluster at LearnBoost
[21:11] jerrysv has joined the channel
[21:11] creationix: dall: each cluster node is a single process with a single thread and a single event loop
[21:11] dall: creationix, perfect
[21:11] dall: solved! ooook fuck nginx
[21:11] dall: :D
[21:12] creationix: tjholowaychuk: what would you recommend for simple static file serving? express, connect, or something else?
[21:12] Fodi69 has joined the channel
[21:12] creationix: tjholowaychuk: I've been using stack + creationix
[21:12] dall: creationix, how the requests are assigned? round robin? (i mean looping to all the cluster created?)
[21:12] tbranyen: i'd be interested to know how node fares against nginx in terms of caching/compression
[21:12] creationix: dall: they aren't assigned, the os just hands the connection to the first available process
[21:13] dall: yes perfect...that what i meant
[21:13] dall: ok
[21:13] dall: last questions creationix ....
[21:13] creationix: only a proxy is able to look at the input and assign to a particular process
[21:13] dall: what happen if a callback crash?
[21:13] dall: the cluster will be killed and restarted?
[21:13] creationix: dall: if there is an exception, it's best to let that process die
[21:13] creationix: then cluster will restart it
[21:13] seawise: okay, I'm interested in live examples of websites and applications built with Node.js, can you point me to some most well-known ones?
[21:14] dall: creationix, amazing! very good
[21:14] dall: ok
[21:14] creationix: seawise: there are some on the node wiki
[21:14] SubStack: Nuck: #3
[21:14] creationix: seawise: I use it for howto.no.de and creationix.com 
[21:14] dall: creationix, thank you so much for the support :)
[21:14] creationix: seawise: but those aren't very fancy
[21:14] seawise: I know only Plurk.com as a top-tier app
[21:14] creationix: dall: thanks tjholowaychuk for cluster
[21:14] seawise: but have heard they have migrated off from Node.js
[21:14] prestonparris has joined the channel
[21:15] creationix: seawise: I hear rumors of it being used at facebook, yahoo and the like
[21:15] seawise: creationix: will check your sites :)
[21:15] seawise: there's a list of top-tier users on MongoDB page for example
[21:15] dall: tjholowaychuk has written the cluster module?
[21:16] creationix: sh1mmer: do you know?
[21:16] creationix: sh1mmer: who are the top node users in production
[21:16] seawise: where can I read about success stories - live use cases of Node.js?
[21:16] creationix: dall: I believe so
[21:16] dall: creationix, wow
[21:16] dall: good
[21:17] creationix: TooTallNate: so what do you guys use for persistance? redis?
[21:17] creationix: oh, mongo
[21:17] mehlah has joined the channel
[21:17] TooTallNate: mongo
[21:17] TooTallNate: and redis for sessions
[21:17] creationix: hence mongoose
[21:17] creationix: that makes sense
[21:17] dall: creationix, how the requests are managed? i mean   HTTP REQUEST --> CLUSTER ---> CHECK THE FIRST FREE PROCESS ----> ASSIGN TO SINGLE CLUSTER NODE
[21:17] dall: ?
[21:17] TooTallNate: lol, ya
[21:17] creationix: dall: no, it's super low level
[21:17] eddanger has joined the channel
[21:17] TooTallNate: dall: I'm pretty sure the kernel assigns to the first available process
[21:18] creationix: dall: cluster binds to port 80, then creates N child processes and passes the fd to each of them
[21:18] context: mongrel scusk !
[21:18] TooTallNate: the "master" cluster process doesn't ever receive client connections
[21:18] creationix: dall: then the child processes all select over the shared port
[21:18] dall: aah ok...understand
[21:18] creationix: dall: so every time a request comes in, the operating system hands it to the first free cluster node
[21:18] dall: master process manage all the childs
[21:18] dall: perfect
[21:18] dall: ok
[21:18] cjm has joined the channel
[21:18] creationix: dall: then the http request handler in that node processes the request
[21:19] darren has joined the channel
[21:19] creationix: dall: the master process isn't a proxy, it just moniters them and restarts them when needed
[21:19] dall: yes...like nginx works
[21:19] dall: + or -
[21:19] creationix: right
[21:19] creationix: nginx is a good architecture, just not very scriptable
[21:19] creationix: node fixes that
[21:19] dall: it has a root (master) process and then his childs
[21:20] creationix: dall: also node processes can change their uid and gid
[21:20] dall: ok perfect
[21:20] dall: creationix, goood!
[21:20] creationix: not sure it cluster has an option to do that automatically.  I'll bet it does
[21:20] dall: aaaaaah one this creationix, is it possible to create a sort of sandbox for each process?
[21:20] jerrysv has joined the channel
[21:20] creationix: dall: what kind of sandbox?
[21:21] dall: i mean.... if i do fs.readFile(...) 
[21:21] TooTallNate: i mean, they're kind of sandboxed already...
[21:21] dall: i want denied the reading of some directories
[21:21] dall: *deny
[21:21] TooTallNate: why?
[21:21] Calvin has joined the channel
[21:21] creationix: dall: you can put the whole cluster in a chroot, or just set up your file permissions the way you want
[21:21] dall: what this night my english is so bad
[21:21] dall: ok
[21:21] creationix: dall: but that's all outside the scope and responsibility of cluster and node

[21:26] tjholowaychuk: 8====D
[21:26] creationix: so I don't know much about companies using node in production from the comsumer's point of view, but I can tell you what companies employ high-profile node developers
[21:27] dall: why i started with php!!!!!!
[21:27] chjj: which ever company employs me ^

[21:28] systemfault: mjr_: Another company without money, right? :/
[21:28] mjr_: Well, they are just getting started.

[21:30] halfhalo: creationix: technically all the webos phones can run node.  we have 2.x running on older devices via wosi's metadoctor
[21:31] creationix: dtan: no, not just node, but it powers background tasks

[21:46] S2kx: context: using the nodejs package wont be the problem, right?
[21:46] seawise: tbranyen: some Java people
[21:46] context: never ask why *they* are. *they* will come for you :p
[21:47] context: s2kx: no. prolly want node-dev though if not already
[21:47] tbranyen: oh the jawa's
[21:47] seawise: some Java people behind Java non-blocking solutions
[21:47] context: s2kx: looks like it might be a missing package. wouldn't know which one though
[21:47] creationix: node is very powerful and lightweight if used correctly
[21:47] creationix: but it's easy for inexperienced people to get it terribly wrong
[21:48] creationix: in production at least

[21:50] creationix: the problem with using event loops in Java, Ruby, and Python is that most of the eco-system uses blocking I/O
[21:50] creationix: so it's dangerous
[21:51] creationix: one accidental dependency on some blocking library and the entire event loop goes to crap
[21:51] creationix: with node there is no such legacy
[21:51] seawise: creationix: yeah, I want to develop real-time game using Node.js and want to be sure that is a good idea
[21:51] creationix: it was non-blocking from inception
[21:51] seawise: have a great idea and completed design on hands
[21:51] creationix: seawise: it's a good idea if you have the expertise or are willing to learn proper javascript and event programming
[21:52] creationix: some things are much easier, and other things are much harder
[21:52] tjholowaychuk: the main flaw of how we have things set up IMO is cases where you need to be robust, but you have 10 different objects to listen on a million damn events
[21:52] wadey has joined the channel
[21:52] Nuck: God I hate when people try to tell me that JS is useless beyond web programming.
[21:52] tjholowaychuk: which is super annoying and fragile
[21:52] seawise: ok, what things are easier?
[21:52] systemfault: Nuck: People are ignorant :)
[21:52] seawise: and this is even more interesting - what things are harder?
[21:52] Nuck: systemfault: I inform them by telling them Firefox uses JS for th UI ;)
[21:52] creationix: seawise: things that involve high-concurrency, real-time network I/O and are otherwise I/O bound
[21:53] Nuck: That always seems to shut them up
[21:53] seawise: I'm experimenting with Node.js on my free time and I like it, like event model
[21:53] systemfault: :)
[21:53] creationix: Nuck: also gnome3 uses js for the window manager
[21:53] Nuck: creationix: orly?
[21:53] systemfault: Ya, RLY.
[21:53] systemfault: And CSS
[21:53] creationix: seawise: but when things go wrong in production it can be hard to debug
[21:53] Skola has joined the channel

[21:53] creationix: seawise: mjr_ can probably give some insight to using it in production
[21:54] creationix: seawise: any software will have problems, the question is if they will be something you can solve
[21:54] dall: creationix, did you use express web framework?
[21:54] llrcombs: anyone else had problems with spawn();'s 2nd arg?
[21:54] systemfault: With the chrome dev tools, JS is not that difficult to debug anymore.
[21:54] creationix: dall: i helped write Connect, but I've never actually used express
[21:54] systemfault: (Even client-side)
[21:54] dall: ok
[21:55] xeodox: Let's say  I have an array.   var a = new Array; a.forEach(function(elem){  console.log(elem); } ); ....is this blocking?
[21:55] seawise: creationix: what things mrj_ is developing?
[21:55] dall: all the developer told express is one of the best web framework
[21:55] llrcombs: I <3 WebKit devtools
[21:55] systemfault: xeodox: Sure
[21:55] creationix: xeodox: yes, Function.prototype.forEach is blocking and syncronous

[21:57] Nuck: dall: ExpressJS is pretty damn easy.
[21:57] mjr_: seawise: node has some unique things that make it interesting in production, but there's nothing that's overall harder or easier than anything else, operationally. 
[21:57] Druide_: anyone who's good at xmpp

[21:58] bogomips2__ has joined the channel
[21:58] seawise: mjr_: can you name that unique things?
[21:58] mjr_: seawise: just be mindful of the GC overhead of your realtime game thing.  GC cost has been my biggest surprise, but it's usually avoidable.
[21:58] Nuck: dallL Aye
[21:58] ezl_ has joined the channel
[21:59] Nuck: dall: expressjs is the site
[21:59] dall: ok
[21:59] seawise: mjr_: and if that is not a secret how do you use Node.js for the backend, can you name some of the use cases it's really good for?
[21:59] Nuck: It's a bit odd if you're used to a server like Apache
[21:59] mjr_: seawise: open a REPL socket for all of your processes and expose useful objects to it so you can inspect / change your program without stopping the process.
[21:59] Nuck: Since you can't just drop shit in a folder and have it work automagically
[21:59] tvc: im not sure how to "include" other files into a script, like i know to include modules you use require() but what if i want to include another .js file in the current directory, so i can make my project modular
[21:59] seawise: mjr_: everything hangs during GC, right?
[21:59] Nuck: But once you get used to it, it's nice.
[22:00] tvc: i cant really find any documentation on it
[22:00] mjr_: seawise: V8 tries really hard to minimize the cost of GC, but yes, the world stops during GC
[22:00] context_ has joined the channel
[22:01] dall: Nuke, one moment...you can set a directory...like the root path to wrok right?
[22:01] Nuck: tvc: You exports.thing = in the file (I think that's the variable, not sure), and then var thing = require('./file.js')
[22:01] dall: i don't understand what you mean
[22:01] seawise: mjr_: and how often CG happens?
[22:01] Nuck: dall: Huh?  You hafta code each path to load the file for itself
[22:01] llrcombs: anyone have any idea why passing args into spawn() wouldn't work properly?
[22:01] mjr_: seawise: you don't really get to pick.  It happens whenever V8 thinks it would be a good idea
[22:01] clvv has joined the channel
[22:01] Nuck: dall: Read through the express site, it's quite helpful
[22:01] dall: Nuck, is there something like "reqrite" ?
[22:01] dall: *rewrite
[22:02] mjr_: seawise: just measure your program with --prof and --trace_gc
[22:02] mikey_p: there's an #express channel now?
[22:02] tjholowaychuk: dall: req.url = 'some new url' is your rewrite :D
[22:02] mjr_: Try it different ways and make sure that you aren't doing excessive GC
[22:02] konobi: node-inspector and the profiling stuff works pretty well
[22:02] Nuck: dall: No need for mod_rewrite, since you write the URLs yourself.
[22:02] tjholowaychuk: mikey_p yeah a node guy registered it
[22:02] Nuck: dall: You'll see once you start using it.
[22:02] tjholowaychuk: mAritz i think
[22:02] seawise: mjr_: what operations emit GC more that others?
[22:03] dall: ehehe yes but if i want to manage request like: example.com/one/two/three
[22:03] bnoordhuis has joined the channel
[22:03] creationix: seawise: anything that mutates memory or creates new objects can trigger a gc
[22:03] dall: cna i put these one - two -three in variable? like $1 $2 $3
[22:03] creationix: seawise: but as a general rule, create as few objects as possible
[22:03] mjr_: seawise: the more objects you keep around, the longer GC will take.
[22:04] creationix: seawise: I often reuse objects in pools and that seems to help some
[22:04] creationix: seawise: but don't prematurely optimize, that will cause more harm than good
[22:04] dtan: ^ been told the same
[22:04] mjr_: yeah, just write your program, and then measure it with --trace_gc
[22:05] mjr_: I've been getting a lot of mileage out of --trace_gc lately
[22:05] kruckenb has joined the channel
[22:05] creationix: mjr_: how long are your gc's usually?  They get nasty long on embedded devices
[22:06] konobi: https://github.com/dannycoates/node-inspector # heap snapshot inspection!!
[22:06] seawise: thanks for advices, guys
[22:06] mjr_: creationix: when things are running well, 1-5ms or so.  When things are not going well, 60+ms
[22:06] dall: guys redis is something like similar to mongo?
[22:07] mjr_: I'm finding that the typical node pattern of setting up lots of little anonymous functions as event handlers for logic ends up costing a non-ignorable amount in GC time.
[22:07] bnoordhuis: slightly on-topic, v8 is getting a new gc that is supposedly many times faster than the current one
[22:07] bnoordhuis: but it'll probably be a while before it lands in node
[22:07] mjr_: Instead if you use a simple anonymous function to bind back to another object, it's way faster.
[22:08] dtan: noob question: what does "gc" stand for?
[22:08] bnoordhuis: dtan: garbage collector :)
[22:08] dtan: ah thanks
[22:09] mjr_: bnoordhuis: that's excellent. I'm looking forward to that and the crankshaft optimizations applied to Buffer index code.
[22:09] devdazed has joined the channel
[22:09] devdazed: hi all, is there a way to send icmp packets using node?
[22:10] devdazed: basically ping, using net?
[22:10] bnoordhuis: devdazed: don't think so, node core doesn't currently expose raw sockets
[22:10] devdazed: would this be possibly with an extension, or even easy?
[22:10] devdazed: *possible
[22:11] bnoordhuis: devdazed: possible? yes. easy? depends on if you know c++ and the unix network api
[22:11] devdazed: bnoordhuis: thanks
[22:12] konobi: devdazed: you could always spawn `ping`
[22:12] mjr_: devdazed: nope, we need raw socket support.
[22:12] devdazed: konobi: i really dont want the overhead of spawning processes
[22:12] mjr_: or you could write a c++ module
[22:12] devdazed: plus it seems sort of hacky to me
[22:12] seawise: another questions, everyone knows Node.js roadmap, what is scheduled for future released, what to be aware of?
[22:12] konobi: you'll also need to run your node process as root
[22:13] WRAz: @mjr_: ++
[22:13] dall: thank you guys..........see you soon
[22:13] dall: by
[22:13] WRAz: I don't know why people are so hesitant to write c++ modules, its a great feature of node.

[22:49] WRAz: Do what needs to be done in a manner that allows extension later but don't sweat the details.
[22:49] robertfw: yeah
[22:49] davve: im sure.
[22:49] robertfw: im having to hammer that into our new developer

[22:51] robertfw: the point i made is that what you think is right when you start

[23:18] bradley: did you install libssl-dev?
[23:18] masylum: it compiles ok, but then I get this error https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/issues/280
[23:19] masylum: I just installed xcode and git bradley, is a fresh Leopard install
[23:20] bradley: you will need to install the development version of openssl, it contains the core of node's crypto library which is used by lots of things
[23:20] bradley: development library* not version
