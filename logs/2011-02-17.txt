[00:02] firdose: Chainfire: i am just building a cachable static js file server with it
[00:02] bmavity: zzak: thanks again for the clarification
[00:03] firdose: could probably use something else, but eventually i want to serve dynamic js files so i am inspired to learn it
[00:03] pkrumins: 2
[00:03] Sebmaster: Chainfire: There will be always specialized things for everything, but node can do many things. so you dont have to lern multiple techniques
[00:04] firdose: there is a certain zen to it, since everything is JSON ;)
[00:04] Chainfire: Sebmaster yes I do understand that, but I'm looking from a POV where you have a large site built for example in PHP, where you would change some things to use node.js because it's more fit.
[00:04] Jaye__: anything real time
[00:05] Jaye__: or hugely concurrent
[00:05] firdose: yeah u may want to do traking/analytics in node
[00:05] benreesman has joined the channel
[00:05] Chainfire: ofcourse you could build the whole thing in Node.js which is undoubtedly faster than the Apache+PHP version, then again, with varnish/nginx/haproxy in front of it you're not very likely to notice the difference ;)
[00:05] orls: Jaye__ took the words out of my mouth
[00:05] Sebmaster: Chainfire: I built most of my website with php too, but since i know node, i want to _really_ test it out
[00:05] benreesman: hi, is anyone aware of a mysql binding for node.js that supports transactions?
[00:05] samcday_: Respamming a question I asked before: Does anyone know of a node lib to manage transactions? That is, manage transactions on several resources at once
[00:06] samcday_: Haha ben ;) jinx!
[00:06] Sebmaster: Chainfire: But isnt nginx a static server?
[00:06] orls: Chainfire: not when you've got more (or same volume of) writes than reads
[00:06] samcday_: Well, kinda similar question anyway.
[00:06] Sebmaster: benreesmen: Um, transactions are made by the database, not your binding...
[00:06] Chainfire: err yes, you'd put the nginx in front of varnishes to perform ssl/gz and such, in this scenario
[00:07] Jaye__: also websockets, neither nginx or varnish know how to handle them
[00:07] benreesman: sebmaster: it seems like node-mysql is the front runner in a lot of ways but the documentation seems to indicate that it doesn't support queries with multiple statements
[00:07] firdose: mongo may be a better fit than mysql
[00:07] orls: Chainfire: then you're talking about a multi-comonent, hard to manage (bad experiences from $day_job) stack, where you could have one eensy node server
[00:07] orls: component^
[00:08] Sebmaster: benreesman: Thats true. you can still call query() multiple times within a transaction
[00:08] zzak: bmavity++
[00:08] v8bot:  zzak has given a beer to bmavity. bmavity now has 2 beers.
[00:08] Chainfire: Jaye__ anything real time, ok, also in my mind. But I'm a bit hard pressed to find an example of that aside from push notifications and such. Tracking/analytics is an interesting thought, though
[00:08] benreesman: sebmaster: ah i gotcha
[00:08] Sebmaster: benreesman: It just means, you cant do query('SELECT x; SELECT y');
[00:08] Chainfire: orls> one node server doesn't reach the performance of an (nginx/)varnish/apache/php setup

[00:09] zzak: Sebmaster: you can use nginx as a reverse proxy
[00:09] Chainfire: the average high load website. but that's also part of the original question though. which parts would you then port to node instead
[00:10] zzak: ..via cgi
[00:10] Sebmaster: zzak: I don't know much about the server stuff, I got hosters for that :p
[00:10] zzak: forgot to add that minor detail ;)
[00:10] Jaye__: fwiw the stack im using is varnish (for virtual hosts and reverse proxy) in front of multiple node servers
[00:11] orls: the point is that there will always be other tools that do some particular X better -- done right, a java-based stack can blow the pants off a php stack. Its not about whether node is the prefect tools for all jobs; but if its very good at your use case, you use it 
[00:11] Chainfire: Jaye__ right, that sounds entirely sensible. however, if the dataset does not exceed the varnish server's capacity and the cache hit to miss ratio is decent, I don't think you'd actually notice a performance difference. Then it becomes fun, not because its needed
[00:12] orls: as i said before, hight write-to-read ratio, large concurrent request volumes and requirement for pretty nippy responese are my use cases
[00:12] Chainfire: orls> have a number of examples for that ?
[00:12] tg: ohai
[00:14] orls: chat and analytics come to mind
[00:14] Jaye__: chainfire is actually right that if most of your data is static there is not a meaningful performance difference between node and varnish or nginx, anyways, g2g
[00:14] orls: oh sure, natch

[00:15] netrealm has joined the channel
[00:16] Chainfire: also I was wondering about disk I/O concurrency. with rotating disks the more threads you are using to access, the slower the throughput. is this scheduled somehow or internally just fire and forget ?
[00:16] aurynn: the OS handles disk IO
[00:17] aurynn: So, if you need more throughput, throw more spindles at it
[00:17] aurynn: :)
[00:17] Chainfire: orls> yeah thats too bad. Looking for an excuse to use it for "stuff". Its hard to find a matching case in your own arsenal if you lack good example use cases and such
[00:17] orls: Chainfire: my point was more about node being a good tool within a stack, not a replacement for anythign else
[00:18] Epeli has joined the channel
[00:18] orls: fwiw i use it for a geoip based alternative-content thingy, with good results. Since we're piggybacking some regional analytics (read:logging to a db) node works well, can get a superfast response to the client w/out breaking page loading
[00:19] Chainfire: orls> sure it can be, if it is strong in something your current case is weak at :)
[00:19] orls: but i'm sure there's a more appropriate tool for that ;)
[00:20] Chainfire: well no actually I'd consider that a good case. the aim is not to use every single tool in existance, but from your (smallish) base set of tools build the best system
[00:20] orls: ..and the reason we can't do the geoip stuff in the java stack is because it's all behind a frontend cache

[00:38] ryah: on the server you can also give the option  rejectUnauthorized

[00:43] unomi has joined the channel
[00:43] Chainfire: can you help me understand this, tmzt ?
[00:43] tmzt: probably something to do with functions being objects, and you redefining it
[00:43] tmzt: I don't think it's a valid way to do a singleton
[00:43] aurynn: Chainfire, it says "If 'this' isn't an instance of me, return a new MyModule instance"
[00:43] tjholowaychuk: Chainfire: protects against Foo() instead of new Foo
[00:44] aurynn: I am so stealing that, tjholowaychuk :)
[00:44] Chainfire: ahhh that makes sens tjholowaychuk
[00:44] tmzt: hmm, ok
[00:44] Chainfire: but where would you put the init code then ?
[00:44] tjholowaychuk: Chainfire: in the else portion of that conditional
[00:44] Chainfire: in the if, or in the else ?
[00:44] Chainfire: right
[00:45] Chainfire: just making sure :)
[00:45] tjholowaychuk: "new" is really lame
[00:46] Chainfire: how is that ?

[00:49] tjholowaychuk: constructors

[00:50] jacobolus has joined the channel
[00:50] mikeal has joined the channel

[00:52] firdose: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/122102/what-is-the-most-efficient-way-to-clone-a-javascript-object
[00:52] Chainfire: if you're just going to add an init(params) to every object aren't you doing the same thing as using a constructor, really?
[00:53] tjholowaychuk: yeah

[00:59] josephhitchens: we didn't lose the ability to transform a plain socket connection to secured, after already having done some cleartext back-and-forth, by negotiating TLS midstream (in 0.4) did we?  I depend on that with my smtp code.

[01:01] ChrisPartridge: tjholowaychuk: are there any roadblocks for supporting https with cluster?
[01:02] tmzt: that's actually what I'm wondering about, writing a small adapter to start a secure and non secure server and drop the relevant sockets in /var/run
[01:02] tmzt: seems like something that could be done with cluster, then all my little spark's go away
[01:03] tjholowaychuk: tmzt / ChrisPartridge: have not tried yet
[01:03] tjholowaychuk: but should be fine
[01:03] malkomalko has joined the channel
[01:03] tjholowaychuk: and you can change the paths for all the sockets / pidfiles to /var/run etc
[01:03] tmzt: does it make sense to keep the secure stuff on the same socket then if nginx is doing the https, I still need to make sure that login's only happen over https

[01:33] isaacs: ChrisPartridge: if you want to overwrite it, nave can install any version with the `usemain` command.  `nave usemain latest` will install 0.4.0 in your current environment
[01:34] ChrisPartridge: isaacs: Your too good mate!
[01:34] isaacs: ChrisPartridge: but if you do `nave use 0.4.0`, then it''ll install it in a special folder, adn then drop you into a shell where that's "the" node.  if you then do `exit`, you'll be back to where it's not installed
[01:34] isaacs: it's just PATH juggling, mostly

[02:07] kawaz_work has joined the channel
[02:07] EyePulp: stuross - have you tried the sort command directly in the mongodb cli?
[02:08] Lorentz: Don't you call .find() on the model anyway, and can pass in sort there like mongo native client does?
[02:09] Lorentz: Well, call sort() afterwards anyway
[02:09] aconran___ has joined the channel
[02:10] stuross: EyePulp - no I haven't tried sorting from the cli. its a simple test db so i assume it would work
[02:12] MikhX has joined the channel
[02:12] EyePulp: stuross - my typical path when I run into mongoose problems is to try and make sure the query is valid at the CLI, then try it on the node-native collection object (bypass mongoose)  with models.Foo.collection({qry},function(err,cursor){ .... });
[02:13] stuross: EyePulp -  thanks for the advice. I'll try it on the cli first. I am trying to sort by date so maybe its sorting just not the way i want.

[03:48] iszak: mikeal, can we get a live stream?
[03:48] mikeal: no
[03:48] mikeal: :)
[03:48] iszak: Why?
[03:48] dannycoates: i submitted a proposal, is there a way to edit it?
[03:48] iszak: node.js isn't closed source, why should nodeconf be any different.
[03:49] mikeal: dannycoates: unfortunately no, but if you send me the changes you want to make i can edit it
[03:49] mikeal: it's not a matter of closed vs. open
[03:49] mikeal: it's a matter of logistics
[03:49] iszak: mikeal, elaborate.
[03:49] mikeal: we're having an in person meetup to build community
[03:49] dannycoates: mikeal: great! thanks
[03:50] mikeal: i've been in open source a long time
[03:50] mikeal: in person meetups are important 
[03:50] mikeal: we record the talks
[03:50] mikeal: so that we can release them later and everyone gets a lot of value out of them
[03:51] mikeal: but it's way too hard to handle the logistiics of a real event and keeping up a website with a live stream

[03:51] iszak: some people are just happy to have a stream.
[03:51] mikeal: iszak: dude, the event doesn't even have internet, I have to pay a company to come in and provide that
[03:51] iszak: oh whoa, that blows.
[03:51] mikeal: and it's going to be stressed with the traffic of 200 geeks with laptops
[03:52] mikeal: i'm not also going to try and stream two video feeds out 
[03:52] iszak: then scrap live and stream and just record it and then later release it
[03:52] skm has joined the channel
[03:52] mikeal: iszak: we're doing that

[03:52] mikeal: it takes time to edit them properly
[03:52] mikeal: but yes, eventually all the videos will go up
[03:53] iszak: I hope so.
[03:53] mikeal: dannycoates: it's a one day event and there is a cap of 30 minutes on all talks
[03:53] mikeal: there are two tracks
[03:53] mikeal: so we're looking at between 24 − 32 talks depending on how we break up the time
[03:53] iszak: have we got a topic list yet?
[03:53] mikeal: now, only the track A talks will get announced long before the conference
[03:54] Vertice has joined the channel
[03:54] mikeal: track B will be made up of talks by people who are already attending and we'll decide about a week before who is accepted

[03:54] mikeal: iszak: call for proposals is still out

[03:54] mikeal: you can apply to speak :)
[03:54] iszak: mikeal, How many people are attending?
[03:54] mikeal: we have a hard limit of 200
[03:54] iszak: soft limit?
[03:54] mikeal: we'll probably fuck up and break that, but it's basically only 200
[03:55] iszak: I would talk but y'know, I don't live in USA and all that.
[03:55] mikeal: submit a tlak tho

[03:56] mikeal: the costs are high but we're doing good on sponsors and we sold all our tickets in like 4 minutes
[03:56] iszak: that's crazy.
[03:56] mikeal: current confirmed sponsors are Yammer and &yet
[03:56] iszak: but I suppose there are only 200
[03:57] mikeal: we have invoices out for many more and as soon as it's in the bank they'll be announced :)
[03:57] iszak: Never heard of either of them.

[04:06] cloudhead: mongo is terrible...
[04:06] pyrony: mikeal: u speak in sF?
[04:06] pyrony: iszak: you get some stuff for free w/ mongo that mysql won't give
[04:06] pyrony: like auto-sharding
[04:06] mikeal: transactions that lock a state for a long period of time don't scale well
[04:06] losing has joined the channel
[04:06] mikeal: but having an insert be transaction scales fine
[04:06] iszak: pyrony, so? one thing.
[04:06] pyrony: and the ability to swap in more nodes when u need more performance
[04:06] mikeal: pyrony: i live in Oakland
[04:06] pyrony: and it will automatically handle a lot of shit for u
[04:07] pyrony: did u speak a few weeks ago?
[04:07] mikeal: and i spoke about couchdb last year all over the US and even in Berlin
[04:07] mikeal: at a little start up Splurk
[04:07] marcello3d: does anyone here use node.js as a replacement for lighttpd/nginx?
[04:07] mikeal: i spoke a few weeks ago at that
[04:07] iszak: marcello3d, it's possible but I wouldn't recommend it.
[04:08] marcello3d: why not?
[04:08] derferman has joined the channel
[04:08] iszak: because it's something that's general purpose vs. something that's very specific in what it does
[04:08] pyrony: so maybe it was u
[04:08] iszak: of coures the specific thing would be better.
[04:08] pyrony: so maybe you can resolve my qualms
[04:08] mikeal: pyrony: where did you see someone speak a few weeks ago?
[04:08] zorzar_ has joined the channel
[04:08] pyrony: and btw, if u wanna be a real pro
[04:08] pyrony: don't badmouth the competition
[04:08] pyrony: it just puts u at a low level
[04:08] mikeal: mongodb is very specific in what it's good at, they just try to claim they are good at a lot of use cases they don't do well
[04:09] marcello3d: same with writing 'u' instead of 'you'
[04:09] iszak: what are we on about?
[04:09] sechrist has joined the channel
[04:09] mikeal: they aren't really competition 
[04:09] mikeal: couchdb isn't trying to be mysql
[04:09] pyrony: yeah well marcello3d i don;t really give a fuck
[04:09] pyrony: :)
[04:09] mikeal: neither is redis
[04:09] marcello3d: just saying.
[04:09] marcello3d: isn't couchdb slow as shit?
[04:09] marcello3d: that's all I've heard about it
[04:09] mikeal: mongodb is trying to be mysql
[04:09] pyrony: couchdb is nosql right?
[04:09] mikeal: and they are a pretty shitty mysql 
[04:09] pyrony: marcello3d: no couchedb was written in c++ for speed
[04:09] mikeal: i mean, postgres is fine
[04:10] pyrony: nosql != relational db
[04:10] marcello3d: I thought it was written in erlang
[04:10] mikeal: umn all of you are wrong
[04:10] mikeal: CouchDB is in erlang
[04:10] iszak: I think unless you've got a specific situation that needs mongodb/couchdb/etc why even use it?
[04:10] pyrony: o i was misinformed
[04:10] mikeal: the interface is HTTP and JavaScript
[04:10] Ond: couche`
[04:10] pyrony: iszak: don't
[04:10] pyrony: but if you need it to scale big
[04:10] marcello3d: pretty sure couchdb wasn't designed for high performance
[04:10] iszak: MySQL can scale.
[04:10] pyrony: then it /might/ be worth it, but it's no silver bullet
[04:10] mikeal: name someone who is using mongodb in "big scale"
[04:10] cloudhead: mongo db lied to its users, it deserves to be badmouthed
[04:10] mikeal: seriously
[04:10] marcello3d: it was designed for high robustness/"reliability"
[04:10] mikeal: no
[04:10] pyrony: nobody says it can't scale iszak
[04:10] marcello3d: mikeal: etsy
[04:11] pyrony: but it gets pretty fuckin messy
[04:11] mikeal: not as their main datastore
[04:11] marcello3d: foursquare is
[04:11] mikeal: come on
[04:11] mikeal: primary datastore
[04:11] marcello3d: yes
[04:11] iszak: pyrony, yeah so really if MySQL had it baked in, it'd basically own MongoDB.
[04:11] marcello3d: foursquare does
[04:11] mikeal: yeah, and it failed epicly :)
[04:11] pyrony: mikeal: twitter
[04:11] pyrony: mikeal: rockyou
[04:11] marcello3d: http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Production+Deployments
[04:11] marcello3d: go read there
[04:11] marcello3d: they explain how it's used everywhere
[04:11] Ond: That list disturbs me.
[04:11] mikeal: twitter isn't using them as their primary
[04:11] pyrony: 4sq
[04:11] ajnasz has joined the channel
[04:11] jesusabdullah: Not fans of mongo?
[04:11] mikeal: yeah, that is a list of logos of people who are using it for caching or analytics
[04:11] jesusabdullah: I'm actually mildly surprised
[04:11] pyrony: apparently not
[04:12] marcello3d: well
[04:12] mikeal: 4sq is using it as a primary datastore
[04:12] mikeal: so is learnboost
[04:12] mikeal: that's all i know of 
[04:12] marcello3d: I don't like the mongo driver on node.js
[04:12] mikeal: hardly "big scale"
[04:12] iszak: jesusabdullah, I have no problem with MongoDB, I just dislike how everyone is using MongoDB without any special requirements.
[04:12] pyrony: is couch directly competing w/ mongo?
[04:12] mikeal: nothing that postgres couldn't handle in it's sleep
[04:12] mikeal: the BBC using CouchDB as their primary datastore
[04:12] jesusabdullah: I wouldn't think so, pyrony
[04:12] cloudhead: no, couch is durable, mongo is not
[04:12] pyrony: lol
[04:13] mikeal: Canonical is using CouchDB for all UbuntuOne users, that's over a million users and over 100K replications requests a minute
[04:13] iszak: Proof or it didn't happen cloudhead.
[04:13] marcello3d: it sounds like etsy is using it as their primary store
[04:13] marcello3d: where are you reading otherwise?
[04:13] pyrony: what is ubuntuone?
[04:13] jesusabdullah: auugh, this compilation is raping my computer
[04:13] mikeal: marcello3d: well, the C mongodb drive won't work in node because it's all blocking IO
[04:13] cloudhead: iszak: uh, it's a design choice the made
[04:13] marcello3d: mikeal: how much of that is reads vs writes
[04:13] cloudhead: they*
[04:13] marcello3d: mikeal: so? the java driver isn't c and it's great
[04:14] ChrisPartridge: jesusabdullah: compiling 0.4.0 ?
[04:14] mikeal: pyrony: every Ubuntu user for a year and a half has a couchdb on their desktop and all their info is synced between computers using a couchdb in the cloud as a sync point, that's UbuntuOne
[04:14] iszak: we need a build bot.
[04:14] marcello3d: mikeal: and couchdb is perfect for that
[04:14] mikeal: it's designed for offline replication
[04:14] marcello3d: but it's definitely a special purpose database
[04:14] pyrony: does couchdb have commercial support like mongo?
[04:14] marcello3d: exactly
[04:14] mikeal: i wouldn't call it special purpose, but i wouldn't call it general purpose either
[04:15] mikeal: it's flexible, but it's not postgres
[04:15] jesusabdullah: ChrisPartridge: Naw, scipy. Completely unrelated to node tbh, but I like to bitch.
[04:15] iszak: mikeal, you love your postgres.
[04:15] pyrony: ?
[04:15] jesusabdullah: I should try compiling 0.4.0 though
[04:15] mikeal: i don't even use postgres much
[04:15] ChrisPartridge: jesusabdullah: ah ok, i compiled 0.4.0 earlier and it just seemed to kill my xen server a little more than usual
[04:15] mikeal: it just works
[04:15] mikeal: and scales
[04:15] mikeal: and did all this shit that you're talking about 10 years ago
[04:16] mikeal: it's the kitchen sink
[04:16] mikeal: for real
[04:16] pyrony: mikeal: does couchdb have commercial support like mongo?
[04:16] mikeal: couchone.com
[04:16] iszak: pyrony, I bet you use windows.
[04:16] marcello3d: doesn't load
[04:16] pyrony: i use a lot of operating systems 
[04:16] marcello3d: wow, they don't support no-www, lol

[04:19] jesusabdullah: oh man openDAP is horrible!

[04:20] Ond: Database? Is that similar to Microsoft?

[04:21] samcday_: My favourite database is CSV.

[04:35] pyrony: btw mikeal: 100K transactions/sec is nothing
[04:35] fairwinds: mikeal: yeah, what is progress with iphone, will it ever a happen
[04:35] pyrony: how many nodes to achieve that?
[04:36] mikeal: fairwinds: waiting on apple
[04:36] mikeal: it's been ported
[04:36] mikeal: just waiting on approval
[04:36] fairwinds: mikeal: oh wow, awesome
[04:36] fairwinds: mikeal: now if we could only get node on iphone it would be sweet :-)
[04:37] pyrony: mikeal conveniently ignores
[04:37] mikeal: pyrony: mongodb doesn't have a response for writes, so their numbers are bullshit
[04:37] mikeal: testing how much you can write to a socket is stupid
[04:37] pyrony: im not talking about mongo
[04:37] pyrony: im just asking questions
[04:37] pyrony: u fail to realize that im not married to mongo

[04:38] pyrony: i have a cluster that does 160K
[04:38] pyrony: to disk.
[04:38] pyrony: just wondering how many nodes it took for u to get there w/ couch
[04:39] Aria: tmzt: Only for multiprocess access. But often, I only need one -- so in process makes sense!
[04:39] fairwinds: mikeal: i have some stuff for iphone currently and really pumped about getting couch there. is there any sort of beta I can try?
[04:40] mikeal: once there is you'll know :)
[04:40] fairwinds: cool, thanks
[04:40] mikeal: pyrony: vanilla couchdb has no clustering
[04:40] mikeal: you need BigCouch
[04:40] pyrony: okay
[04:40] mikeal: and the BBC wrote their own thing
[04:40] mikeal: so you'd have to ask the cloudant guys
[04:41] mikeal: they must do that much
[04:41] pyrony: so u throw numbers around
[04:41] pyrony: without knowing what is driving it?
[04:41] pyrony: it's okay if you do, just be real.
[04:41] mikeal: i said 100K replications requests a minute
[04:41] mikeal: go and look
[04:41] pyrony: o
[04:41] mikeal: that's against a single box with 4 cores
[04:42] mikeal: that has over a million databases on it
[04:42] tmzt: does Ubuntu have a iPhone client by any chance?

[04:43] pyrony: is: ok
[04:44] fairwinds: mikeal: your request is very good. I am making good use of it
[04:44] tmzt: how do you think either a 256m xen instance (what I have now) or aws either the free instance or small would hold up with mongo, or just use their database (more work but maybe worth it)
[04:44] mikeal: fairwinds: thanks, working on 2.0 now
[04:44] mikeal: found a good bug in node core with it
[04:45] tmzt: I mean does anybody have experience with this, like number of simultaneous users, etc.
[04:45] pyrony: tmzt: guaranteed to suck
[04:45] pyrony: mongo is a ram hog
[04:45] tmzt: on the server side?
[04:45] fairwinds: mikeal: wow. how bad is the bug?
[04:45] pyrony: on my ubuntu vm w/ 512mb of ram it swamps it once i load up a few million user records
[04:45] tmzt: lovely, I still have no idea how big my datasets are even going to be
[04:46] pyrony: tmzt: figure that out first.
[04:46] tmzt: every feature in the application will add more data ontop of the basic user information
[04:47] tmzt: I pretty much no how big that is going to be, I also have the url alias stuff which is tiny and might just get moved to redis (at least as a cache)
[04:48] pyrony: or just put it in sqlite
[04:48] pyrony: (for small shit)
[04:49] pyrony: it's 2011
[04:49] pyrony: stop using redis
[04:49] Aria: Why?
[04:49] pyrony: it fits some use cases
[04:49] Aria: Atomic ops for the win!
[04:49] pyrony: but you have to be really careful
[04:49] pyrony: remember it's a fukn caching layer, not a good place to store persistent data
[04:50] tmzt: is there a connect middleware that just sets a req setting on a vhost (or other header maybe)
[04:51] tmzt: I'm looking at the vhost middleware and it looks like a lot of duplication
[04:51] Aria: Hm. Not that I'm aware of, but that's so trivial...
[04:52] pyrony: tmzt maybe u should just use php
[04:52] pyrony: or asp
[04:53] tmzt: why?
[04:54] andrewfff has joined the channel

[04:55] aurynn: ...?
[04:55] pyrony: lulz
[04:55] tmzt: Aria: so I can just write to the req object? I haven't seen a tiny example of one
[04:56] Aria: Sure.

[04:56] aurynn: instead of response#*
[04:56] sholmes: what happens if a static file's location is matches a route in express?
[04:56] tmzt: I've also got to modularize this thing, app.router is what to use for that?
[04:57] tmzt: sholmes: unless you tell node (or express or whatever) to server a static file it won't
[04:57] beawesomeinstead has joined the channel
[04:58] ChrisPartridge: sholmes: depends if your staticProvider is before or after the routing in the stack, afaik
[04:58] Aria: sholmes: The beauty of /being/ the webserver rather than an application process is that your app has control over that. It serves it if you tell it to, not otherwise.

[05:05] marcello3d: https://github.com/visionmedia/jade/blob/master/examples/nested-filters.js
[05:06] Jaye_: thats not doing what you want but its close enough that you could reuse most of that code
[05:08] marcello3d: yea
[05:09] Jaye_: one caveat i ran into when writing a js bundler, make sure you do something to ensure the proper script order
[05:09] Jaye_: i didnt use a jade filter though
[05:10] marcello3d: yea I'm figuring I'll just use a jade filter to wrote the existing script tags
[05:10] marcello3d: *wrap
[05:10] marcello3d: then the order is defined in the jade file
[05:11] hij1nx has joined the channel

[05:21] Ond: Beg your pardon
[05:21] sholmes: I'll post them for others then.

[05:22] tmzt: function roleCheck(role) {return function(r,r,n) {}}
[05:22] marcello3d: Jaye_: but you shouldn't use node code on the client, anyways? why would you closure ocmpile it
[05:22] tmzt: sholmes: use gist.github.com makes that really easy
[05:22] marcello3d: uglify sounds good
[05:23] marcello3d: and doesn't have the overhead of the jvm
[05:23] Evet has joined the channel
[05:23] marcello3d: impressive that it has a full javascript parser in javascript :)
[05:23] tmzt: marcello3d: look at substack's new thing
[05:23] sholmes: tmzt: good idea ;)
[05:24] marcello3d: tmzt: what's that?
[05:24] tmzt: browserfy I think, with require
[05:24] Evet has joined the channel
[05:24] tmzt: unless I have them confused

[05:24] marcello3d: ah, I see
[05:25] brapse has joined the channel
[05:26] Jaye_: yeah, that
[05:26] Jaye_: can write the same code for client and server
[05:26] sholmes: Here we go just four simple files https://gist.github.com/831037
[05:26] marcello3d: I will have to explore this more tomorrow
[05:26] marcello3d: thanks for the pointers
[05:27] Jaye_: should look at narcissus if you think uglify is cool, its a javascript engine written in javascript
[05:27] boaz_ has joined the channel
[05:27] marcello3d: one last question
[05:27] marcello3d: on connect-assetmanager they say "Running with" "connect app -n 4"
[05:27] marcello3d: what is that?
[05:27] Jaye_: 4 instances
[05:27] marcello3d: but what's the connect commandline?
[05:28] mape: marcello3d: that is rather old, connect doesn't do that any more
[05:28] Jaye_: dont think it exists anymore
[05:28] marcello3d: ah ok
[05:28] sholmes: updated it with the error message.
[05:28] mape: but now you can use spark2 instead
[05:28] marcello3d: spark2?
[05:28] marcello3d: man. someone needs to organize all this information
[05:28] mape: https://github.com/davglass/spark2
[05:28] marcello3d: I feel quite lost in all the node modules :D
[05:28] Jaye_: https://github.com/ry/node/wiki/modules
[05:28] marcello3d: yea I read that list
[05:29] abraham has joined the channel
[05:29] Ond: What about the latest learnboost product
[05:29] marcello3d: but a lot of people say it's outdated? and there are certainly...
[05:29] Ond: Cluster-something?
[05:29] marcello3d: a lot to go through :)
[05:29] Jaye_: yeah there is stuff missing
[05:29] mape: marcello3d: or https://github.com/LearnBoost/cluster , haven't tried it thought, I've used spark2 with great success
[05:29] Jaye_: i did not know about cluster, that looks damn awesome
[05:30] marcello3d: oh cool
[05:30] mape: marcello3d: but in the end the asset manager won't be an issue of performance, most likely the bandwidth will max before the cpu, all it really does is serving buffers
[05:30] marcello3d: sure
[05:30] marcello3d: asset manager looks good, I like the multi-browser pre-processing
[05:30] Jaye_: i use it for css/preprocessing and browserify for js
[05:31] marcello3d: does it support hash naming?
[05:31] marcello3d: like name the file based on a hash of the combined/minified contents
[05:31] superjudge has joined the channel
[05:31] marcello3d: the 'middleware' category on that modules list is a kinda unruly
[05:32] Aria: Time to clean it up?
[05:32] mape: marcello3d: nope but easy enough to write yourself, I just use timestamps, it's a little more rought but gets the cache invalidation done, https://github.com/mape/node-express-boilerplate/blob/master/server.js#L95
[05:32] dthompson has joined the channel
[05:33] marcello3d: timestamps cause problems on a cluster though, ya?
[05:33] Jaye_: cluster wasnt around when he wrote that i think :P
[05:33] marcello3d: if two different servers you're load balancing to have different times for a file
[05:33] mape: Sure, then just create a handler har returns a hash and use that
[05:34] marcello3d: sounds good
[05:35] marcello3d: would you make a separate asset manager for each "group" of css/js files?
[05:36] jtsnow has joined the channel
[05:36] mape: no need really

[05:38] marcello3d: ooh
[05:38] marcello3d: I see now
[05:38] marcello3d: the top level 'js' and 'css' are jsut ids
[05:38] marcello3d: not the data types

[06:21] beta_ has joined the channel
[06:21] pquerna: (and expensive)
[06:21] russell_h: pquerna: I want to not break references to the object without some sort of evil hackery
[06:21] russell_h: (ie, keeping a list of all references)
[06:24] pquerna: but change what its doing?
[06:24] pquerna: maybe you just want a wrapper/proxy object
[06:24] pquerna: that points to the 'real' backend

[08:26] sholmes: If you see the error, it says at ... at ... etc.
[08:29] bingomanatee: Yes
[08:29] bingomanatee: At the risk of telling you something you already know - the fundamental error is that a module you are requiring doesn't exist at the path you are passing to require.
[08:30] swistak has joined the channel
[08:30] bingomanatee: Two suggestions: 
[08:30] Sebmaster has joined the channel
[08:30] bingomanatee: 1) make sure that you have npm'd modules you need
[08:31] ph^ has joined the channel
[08:31] bingomanatee: 2) I tend to prefer to bundle as many modules as I can INSIDE my project so that my modules don't get upgraded from underneath my feet via NPM or some such. 
[08:32] bingomanatee: in which case the patlh to them becomes something like __dirname + '/library/express/lib/express' 
[08:32] bingomanatee: Understand?
[08:32] sholmes: bingomanatee: yess
[08:33] [AD]Turbo has joined the channel
[08:34] [AD]Turbo: yo
[08:34] sholmes: bingomanatee: but in order to do it, I'd need to install the module in the lib folder, which will add weight to my app.
[08:34] bingomanatee: If you want a concrete example of this in action check out https://github.com/bignomanatee/noogle; the "context.js" file in root pre-seeds the local paths into the global path space, and express is in my library folder. 
[08:37] aceking5: node needs something like bundler

[08:42] Druid_ has joined the channel
[08:42] bingomanatee: sholmes - whether NPM installs a module or you put it in the folder, express is still there. What sort of "Weight" bothers you - JS files are minscule. 
[08:43] bingomanatee: NPM is as close to bundler as we have at this point. 
[08:44] bingomanatee: Node isn't Ruby / RoR; it won't be for a few years. There are many ways it could be made better, but in its current form, Node already supports a lot of commercial efforts and OS projects.

[08:48] bingomanatee: As far as I can tell, anything I can stick into a library file and refer to by a single require() statement is clean enough for me.

[10:32] SubStack: kristsk: oh yeah and the person who was asking about html entities left irc before I could share it with them :/
[10:33] chapel: hey SubStack :)
[10:33] seivan: Are there any guides on node deployment, sys-adminy stuff, dealing with dependencies and etc?
[10:33] slickplaid: SubStack++
[10:33] v8bot:  slickplaid has given a beer to SubStack. SubStack now has 16 beers.
[10:33] slickplaid: you make my life easier :D
[10:33] squeeks: SubStack: patches welcome?
[10:35] aceking5: seivan: npm for deps, Vows for testing
[10:35] seivan: deployment=
[10:35] SubStack: squeeks: patches for which?
[10:35] seivan: server?
[10:35] squeeks: node-ent
[10:36] aceking5: deployment = whatever you want
[10:36] greut: trying to install npm but got this: Error: Cannot find module 'semver'
[10:36] greut: same with HEAD, 0.4.0 or 0.3.8
[10:37] SubStack: squeeks: for just ampersands and angle brackets?
[10:37] squeeks: no, not just spewing out HTML entities but also numerical entities
[10:37] squeeks: (so XML parsers strictly parsing XHTML don't baulk)
[10:41] SubStack: oh it does numerical stuff
[10:42] SubStack: > require('ent').encode('\u1337')
[10:42] SubStack: '&#4919;'
[10:44] seivan: So I don't get it, why would you want a web-framework in Node.JS, I mean I can tell that Node.JS would be kick-ass for web-sockets and what not.
[10:45] SubStack: seivan: because it's easy to write code that scales well
[10:45] seivan has left the channel
[10:45] seivan has joined the channel
[10:45] SubStack: and code that handles streaming smartly from the start
[10:46] aceking5: SubStack even if the code doesn't require async i/o?
[10:46] seivan: yeah as aceking5 said
[10:47] squeeks: SubStack: err, what about entities that could be either HTML or numerical? © can either be &copy; or &#xa9;
[10:48] SubStack: squeeks: ent checks for the &copy; codes first and falls back on numerics
[10:48] squeeks: Yes, I realise this.
[10:49] SubStack: aceking5: well in practice servers tend to do a lot of i/o
[10:49] squeeks: what if I want nothing but decimal/hex encodings since? hence suggestion of patch.
[10:49] aceking5: this is true
[10:50] SubStack: squeeks: ah sure that could be a useful patch
[10:50] SubStack: I should also expose the raw data so people can poke at it
[10:51] squeeks: also is it really best idea to pack entities in file and read filesystem? I just shove things like that into an object.
[10:51] Sebmaster: greut: You have to do "git submodule update --init"
[10:51] greut: TA
[10:52] SubStack: squeeks: well when you require() you hit the disk /anyway/ and requires get cached too
[10:53] squeeks: why hit it twice? I mean, it's not that good looking is it?
[10:54] squeeks: http://cdn.mgsrvr.com/thissiterocks/pics/p495.jpg
[10:55] SubStack: I like my data to be separate from the code is all

[13:01] prank has joined the channel
[13:01] juan77: I'm missing something here... how I convert a data to an js object?
[13:02] augustl: how do you invoke system commands with node? I.e. generating ssl certs with openssl.
[13:02] dexterous: juan77: that's 'cause readFile is just giving you the data as a UTF8 string, not an pbject
[13:02] augustl: not sure if what I'm asking for is shelling out, or popen, or something else..
[13:02] juan77: hi dexterous thx for your response, I tried with binaty also and same problem, which encoding I need to use?

[13:12] dexterous: @bcantrill added dtrace probes to node recently, which were pulled in by @ryah in 0.4.0

[13:12] dexterous: but had no luck getting the provider to enable
[13:13] dexterous: iszak: hope that answers your question
[13:14] iszak: dexterous, what's the build command for dtrace?
[13:15] Nexxy has joined the channel
[13:16] dexterous: well, i looked through the wscript in 0.4.0 and it had a --with-dtrace flag that built the provder from src/node_provider.d as a postprocess step
[13:18] iszak: oh I see, restricted to solaris.
[13:18] iszak: is Solaris any good?

[13:19] groom: but i never see "done". is there sth like onerror?
[13:19] iszak: because it's client side and doesn't load it?
[13:19] iszak: i mean it's server side
[13:19] jetienne: groom: note that any of this is node.js
[13:20] jetienne: groom: after that you may need to put in the window with appendTo
[13:20] groom: yes, sure, i use jsdom

[14:35] evl: too bad it's not in the topic ;)
[14:36] brianc: evl: the version directly after 0.2.6 is 0.4.0
[14:36] brianc: evl: the 'odd numbered' branches are considered unstable
[14:36] s1ghs has joined the channel
[14:36] jakeskik: vilhonen: what testframework you are using?
[14:36] brianc: evl: so eventually you'll brew upgrade from 0.4.x to 0.6.0
[14:36] vilhonen: jakeskik: expresso
[14:36] vilhonen: I'm trying with vows now
[14:36] s1ghs: hey people
[14:37] Me1000 has joined the channel
[14:37] jakeskik: vilhonen: vows is pretty nice
[14:37] s1ghs: i'm quite sure it's not possible tho i thought i'd ask - is it possible to extend modules in node?
[14:37] vilhonen: it still bothers me that I might get stuck somewhere without any means to determine where my node.js application is waiting
[14:37] vilhonen: how do you guys deal with it
[14:37] s1ghs: like one module inherits all goodies from other etcetra?
[14:38] lukegalea has joined the channel
[14:38] FireFly: s1ghs, you can require() the other module and iterate over its properties, reassigning them to your exports
[14:38] FireFly: and then alter the functions you export
[14:38] FireFly: I suppose
[14:38] jakeskik: vilhonen: are you working with some web framework or with plain node.js?
[14:38] s1ghs: hmm
[14:38] jakeskik: toby is quite nice for rest apis etc
[14:39] vilhonen: jakeskik: it shouldn't matter but I'm working with the express web framework
[14:39] groom: jetienne: appendTo was the key, thx
[14:39] jakeskik: vilhonen: i'd go with toby then :)

[14:41] jakeskik: or toby + vows, however that's a bit of a challenge due to vows async testing model and tobys (in)compatible api. One needs to write wrapper class for toby
[14:41] s1ghs: FireFly: guess that would mean that one module can be exteneded by only a single sub module since modules are cached
[14:42] vilhonen: the test framework doesn't matter as I'm not able to find out what my program is doing even in the simplest of the cases
[14:42] piscisaureus: mraleph: you want me to cast that pthread_t twice?
[14:43] jakeskik: vilhonen: console.log ? =)
[14:43] piscisaureus: pthread_t -> intptr_t -> enum
[14:43] mraleph: piscisaureus: well that will not work on x64
[14:43] mraleph: piscisaureus: unfortunately :-(
[14:43] piscisaureus: mraleph: but cygwin doesn't support x64 anywayu
[14:43] piscisaureus: but I think it would be ugly as well 
[14:44] jakeskik: vilhonen: or if you don't mind creating a gist at gist.github.com, we could take a look
[14:44] mraleph: piscisaureus: oh! that changes the game :-) yes please do cast it to enum. and add the check that people are not trying to build x64 arch.
[14:44] evl: brianc: thanks :)

[16:01] Chainfire: ah right
[16:01] brianc: Chainfire: and then afterwards, go about your background processing as usual
[16:02] ceej has joined the channel
[16:02] Chainfire: cool
[16:02] brianc: Chainfire: the tradeoff is if there's a problem with the background process the client wont be informed
[16:02] Chainfire: the client doesn't care
[16:02] Chainfire: in this case
[16:02] brianc: Chainfire: sweet
[16:02] Chainfire: node.js will have to log the problem somewhere
[16:03] brianc: ya
[16:03] Chainfire: this is actually I think not possible with most other serverside tools (like apache/php for instance)

[16:04] juan77: hi, any one knows that mysql-libmysqlclient has problem installing with npm 0.3.0-6 and node 0.4.0? I can't figure out how to install it...
[16:04] Chainfire: is using a httpserver over 127.0.0.1 significantly faster than over <network ip> , btw ?
[16:04] fatjonny has joined the channel
[16:04] kristsk: um, i am not sure it is supported on 0.4
[16:04] squeeks: Chainfire: not really.
[16:05] juan77: mysql-libmysqlclient works fine with 0.3.8, I think that doens't have changed too mucho to cause this kind of problem...maybe I'm wrong..
[16:05] kristsk: if you have huge packets, there might be difference, but usuaaly it is quite 
[16:05] losing has joined the channel
[16:05] kristsk: negligible
[16:05] Chainfire: payload is not expected to be more than 256 bytes
[16:06] kristsk: then i would not wory much about it
[16:06] kkaefer: is there a way make to specify a thread ID or something like that so that libeio always executes my requests in the same thread?
[16:06] kkaefer: or is there any other way to make sure that libeio always uses the same thread?
[16:06] kristsk: you will probably hit some other bottleneck before this becomes an isue
[16:06] squeeks: like the kernel's IP stack and it's most likely poor configuration
[16:07] Chainfire: in this use case PHP would connect to a node.js socket (on the same machine) that would do some extra processing... of course I want that to be as quick as possible so the user does not have to wait long for it
[16:08] squeeks: Chainfire: what kristsk said. your issues won't be using lo0 v. en0. your issues will be code and configuration.
[16:08] squeeks: remember: premature optimisation is a problem, not a solution.
[16:08] Chainfire: k, just making sure there aren't any hidden snags.
[16:09] kristsk: why send it to php?
[16:09] colinclark has joined the channel
[16:09] kristsk: php will hog ram on bigger loads
[16:09] kristsk: or did i misunderstand somthing
[16:11] squeeks: something tells me your PHP (let me guess, Apache + mod_php?) might be the bigger problem than node.
[16:11] Chainfire: kristsk> because the rest of the app is in PHP... with multiple varnishes in front. The idea is to send off data regarding what has to be invalidated on all varnish servers (instead of just the one the request came through). Node.js receives this data and sends it over its persistant CLI connections to all the varnish servers, without PHP having to wait for it.
[16:12] kristsk: um, why not make node do that? is the logic too complex?
[16:12] zachsmith has joined the channel
[16:12] Chainfire: make node do what ?
[16:12] Chainfire: exactly ?
[16:12] augustl: I'll try again.. When using client certificates in TLS in node, is there a way for me to get a hold of that certificate?

[16:13] jlecker has joined the channel

[16:14] lukegalea: ie: fire off the job via redis and have node workers pull the jobs off the queue.

[16:16] Chainfire: also kristsk> that's pretty much what I'm betting on, Apache/PHP being a bigger problem than Node.js. The other way around and it would fall apart ;)
[16:16] piscisaureus: mraleph: so I addressed all your issues
[16:16] pyrony has joined the channel
[16:17] squeeks: Chainfire: are you using anything apache specific? why not consider trading out apache for nginx + fastcgi?
[16:17] Chainfire: squeeks> that might happen too
[16:17] mraleph: piscisaureus: then press the magic 'm' button on your keyboard so I will get a mail from you :-)
[16:17] aurynn has joined the channel
[16:17] lukegalea: well, it wouldn't be hard to toss it in. The reason I raise it is that what you are describing sounds exactly like what we do.. we have a bunch of web servers (php, ruby, etc) depending on the site and anything that doesn't directly pertain to the response is backgrounded via resque. if you just have php hit node directly and trigger immediate action you have no ability to throttle the rate at which it occurs.
[16:17] mraleph: piscisaureus: oh you did it
[16:17] lukegalea: but if you introduce an intermediate job store like redis, etc..
[16:17] Sami_ZzZ has joined the channel
[16:17] squeeks: Chainfire: watch your memory consumption when you do it.
[16:17] Chainfire: but then there'd prolly be something like ngins --> X varnish --> Y webservers
[16:17] lukegalea: then you can control the number of workers.
[16:17] seivan: Alright
[16:18] piscisaureus: oh now i did it twice :-(
[16:18] seivan: settled for Node and Redis
[16:18] Chainfire: err, nginx --> X varnish --> Y nginx
[16:18] alexweber15 has joined the channel
[16:19] squeeks: Chainfire: I do this trick with memcached and nginx's memcached module by putting expiration on keys, my app can write the page to memcached, and nginx only serves from that until expiration.

[16:20] mraleph: why I started typing "I" instead of "it" all the time... 
[16:20] piscisaureus: mraleph: I don't know if something about the cla changed 
[16:21] piscisaureus: mraleph: I had it signed for this issue: http://codereview.chromium.org/5471001/
[16:21] Chainfire: squeeks> its interesting solution and something I have heard of before. that didn't fit our needs, but I'm searching my mind why that was
[16:22] mraleph: piscisaureus: well. CLA is once and for all issues.
[16:22] Chainfire: I think because nginx+memcached simply can't match the speed of varnish
[16:22] nuba has joined the channel
[16:22] piscisaureus: mraleph: mr Ager did not like the build system changes?
[16:23] squeeks: Chainfire: stick some varnish in front of ngnix then!
[16:24] Chainfire: well yeah that's ultimately probably going to happen, but in a different manner :)
[16:24] squeeks: Chainfire: I can saturate a bonded GbE link with a few nginx boxes this way, I have far greater reads over writes and invalidation is currently set to 96 hours in some parts, 30 minutes in others.
[16:25] seivan: hmm
[16:26] Chainfire: is this a local memcached or a distributed one ?

[18:23] ncb000gt: jiggliemon: read the file into a buffer and tostring it with an encoding of 'base64'
[18:23] jiggliemon: Node out of the box will read a file?  or do i need a File handeling module?
[18:23] jiggliemon: Sorry, Im pretty fresh.
[18:24] lukegalea: jiggliemon: you pretty much can't do anything without requiring modules.. but it's included with the node distro. just look at the "fs" docs.
[18:24] darkredandyellow: ACTION sighs
[18:24] ncb000gt: jiggliemon: np. :) var fs = require('fs'); will import the native module

[18:25] jiggliemon: ncb000gt: Thanks.  I'll look into that.  I heard there was some issues with regards to file handeling in node.js.  
[18:26] ncb000gt: jiggliemon: such as?
[18:26] jiggliemon: Nothing concrete.  And i can't even remember the specific issue, Something I/O comes to mind though.

[19:22] ncb000gt: ACTION ducks
[19:23] ncb000gt: _schulte_: :) sure
[19:23] _schulte_: I thought those were optional

[19:23] _schulte_: point made :)
[19:24] aklt has joined the channel
[19:24] ncb000gt: _schulte_: and yes, in almost all cases they are optional.
[19:25] ncb000gt: the only comment I have, which is based on personal pref. is just to move helper functions out of your server code to a separate file and then include them as a module.
[19:25] _schulte_: ncb000gt: alright, well if that's the worst, then it's good to know I'm not setting anything on fire
[19:25] ncb000gt: so decode, input, to_form would be in a different file
[19:26] _schulte_: ncb000gt: agreed, that would be an improvement, and I could include it with require('./utility.js') or somesuch?
[19:26] ncb000gt: _schulte_: exactly that
[19:26] ncb000gt: oh sorry
[19:26] ncb000gt: require('utility')
[19:27] mraleph: ryah: I just need to manage and grab a ticket before the event sells out in one minute :-)
[19:27] _schulte_: that's one point I don't entirely get, var foo = require('foo') is required to protect namespaces, and then require automatically associates all global objects in foo with the foo variable?
[19:27] ncb000gt: _schulte_: another note is that many people tend to do things using callbacks
[19:28] _schulte_: ncb000gt: where did I miss a callback oportunity?
[19:28] ncb000gt: so instead of using res.send(to_form(decode(specs))) you could do something like to_form(decode(specs, function(data) {res.send(data);})
[19:28] ncb000gt: or something similar

[19:46] mjr_: It's all just so magical.
[19:46] pquerna: +1
[19:47] mjr_: In browserland, I'm content to not understand the magic, but when writing servers, it ends up mattering.
[19:48] jetienne: more links between node and v8 people is a natural thing to do
[19:48] brianc: but know what exactly is fast and slow only works until they change v8.  Maybe what is slow today will be fast next week?
[19:49] mraleph: brianc: that's exactly my point. 
[19:49] bradleymeck: many people want to try to keep from being too ingrained to v8, wasnt there a spidermonkey guy that wondered if providing a nicer api would mean node could support it?

[19:53] felixge: piscisaureus: Nothing if you decide to present, which you should :)
[19:53] piscisaureus: heh sounds fun
[19:53] felixge: piscisaureus: otherwise it's going to be very affordable << 100 EUR I think
[19:53] piscisaureus: but about what
[19:53] felixge: piscisaureus: porting node to windows? *g*
[19:54] piscisaureus: heh yeah maybe but hopefully there will be nothing to talk about
[19:54] felixge: and don't tell me that's not exciting, you should have thought about that before working on it
[19:54] felixge: :)
[19:54] mraleph: jetienne: well. yes I actually have a draft of this kind of talk. 
[19:54] jetienne: mraleph: you are already halfdone! excelent :)
[19:54] piscisaureus: I will think about it. There's some time still before june
[19:55] felixge: piscisaureus: I think you'd be more than qualified to give a general node internals talk as well
[19:55] felixge: I'd find it very exciting
[19:55] piscisaureus: I think that that could be done
[19:55] piscisaureus: as long as it's not about tls :O
[19:55] piscisaureus: but I will be there anyway
[19:55] mraleph: jetienne: but people usually expect some magical solution, a dark secret technique that allows to make every single node.js app 10x times faster.
[19:55] felixge: piscisaureus: you get to decide that
[19:55] felixge: piscisaureus: but I think you can consider yourself invited as a speaker (I'm helping a tiny bit with the organization)
[19:56] piscisaureus: But hopefully I will not be to late to register because I heard nodeconf was sold out in what? 5 minuts?
[19:56] piscisaureus: ok
[19:56] felixge: piscisaureus: email me / tim / michael (see nodecamp.de for their emails) when you know what topic you'd like
[19:56] piscisaureus: felixge: thanks. I will think about an interesting talk
[19:56] felixge: piscisaureus: I will make sure you get in.
[19:56] piscisaureus: :-)
[19:56] felixge: piscisaureus: again, you won't need a ticket if you present
[19:56] aaronblohowiak: mraleph: there is such a technique: reduce, reuse, recycle
[19:56] bradleymeck: as much as i would love to compete w/ C in speed i dont think we can get that 10x speed boost from something simple
[19:56] jetienne: mraleph: part of 'your job' is to explain them how v8 teams see it. not a magical wand they want to hear. this is about getting actual links between node.js community and v8 team. in my opinion at least
[19:57] mraleph: aaronblohowiak: yes. make your app an empty app.js file. it's infinitely fast… 
[19:58] aaronblohowiak: mraleph: it is the empty space inside a pitcher that makes it useful
[19:58] aaronblohowiak: Om....

[20:00] JamieD: hi all, I'm new to node and I'm having an issue when trying to require and modules, I get errors like Error: Cannot find module 'optimist'. I have node 0.4 and npm 0.3.0-6 installed and have the relevant modules installed.
[20:00] noahcampbell has joined the channel

[20:00] ncb000gt: JamieD: if so, did you use npm?

[20:01] ncb000gt: mraleph: low blow
[20:01] ncb000gt: :)
[20:01] JamieD: ncb000gt: yes npm install optimist
[20:01] JamieD: I suspect it may be a path/permissions issue with npm
[20:01] jetienne: $ touch /tmp/bla.js && time node /tmp/bla.js
[20:02] jetienne: real	0m0.026s
[20:02] mraleph: ncb000gt: I did work on JVM before working on V8, so I actually know that Java can be as fast as C if used right :-)
[20:02] Jaye_: i was surprised when i saw recent benchmarks, almost makes me want to use haskell
[20:03] Jaye_: fuck i mean clojure
[20:03] aaronblohowiak: jetienne: npm list --installed
[20:03] bradleymeck: mraleph im not sure all of the design patterns in java lead towards that though
[20:03] vipaca: Just wondering what everyones using as a build tool. I see some make primarily with an assortment of rake, cake, and others?
[20:03] JamieD: npm ls installed shows the modules I am trying to use. although npm was installed using sudo and I have to run sudo when installing new modules. could that be whats stopping node from finding the modules?
[20:03] jetienne: aaronblohowiak: ok tell that to JamieD
[20:03] tjholowaychuk: vipaca: make
[20:03] vipaca: Also is there npm packging tool?
[20:04] isaacs: vipaca: npm IS a packaging tool :)

[20:04] v8bot:  aaronblohowiak has given a beer to tjholowaychuk. tjholowaychuk now has 15 beers.
[20:04] mraleph: bradleymeck: well in a sense design patterns of node might not always play well with v8 as well.
[20:04] vipaca: tjholowaychuk This is what I was going to use assuming you can write c-extension for v8 and node
[20:04] isaacs: JamieD: works for me.
[20:04] bradleymeck: mraleph true :), especially if coroutines somehow make it into there
[20:04] isaacs: JamieD: what version of npm/node/optimist?
[20:05] JamieD: is there an npm environment command equivalent to rubys "gem environment"?

[20:08] tjholowaychuk: NickP: make install-bundle

[20:08] tjholowaychuk: jade has one too, there is a link to it in the readme
[20:08] felixge: When I google "node.js" there is an add saying: "Netflix is Hiring".
[20:08] NickP: thanks TJ
[20:08] felixge: "Netfliex needs experts in Node JS"
[20:08] isaacs: JamieD: ok.  what's `sudo npm config ls`?
[20:08] felixge: wondering if this is a weird keyword combination, or if they indeed plan to use some node
[20:08] felixge: :)
[20:08] bradleymeck: mmmm working for netflix would be cool

[20:10] felixge: piscisaureus: no idea. My guess is 30-45m
[20:11] JamieD: isaacs: only diff with sudo is group = "20" vs group = 20 and tmproot is a different location

[20:15] tmzt: anybody know why mongo-node would report that it saved somethng but the db is not updated?
[20:15] bradleymeck: Jaye_ the port isnt too hard, but the big thing is the f'ing require function
[20:16] Jaye_: ya just hit "cannot find module.." :P
[20:17] tmzt: bradleymeck: substack has one of those too which doesn't require ajax loading
[20:17] JamieD: isaacs: interestingly, if I download the latest tar of npm and try to install it I get... Error: Cannot find module 'semver'
[20:17] bradleymeck: tmzt the problem is blocking, making stuff work isnt too bad, but you cant block at the right time
[20:17] ossareh has joined the channel
[20:17] tmzt: blocking?
[20:17] isaacs: JamieD: what version of node
[20:17] isaacs: ?
[20:18] bradleymeck: require() blocks until it is done
[20:18] JamieD: isaacs: 0.4.0
[20:18] isaacs: hmm...
[20:18] tmzt: ah
[20:18] Jaye_: since its a view engine if you block then the UI will freeze up, users be mad
[20:18] isaacs: JamieD: define "download the latest tar of npm"?
[20:18] isaacs: do you mean, from github?
[20:18] tmzt: he's preprocessing the js file to include the modules and using require as a kind of cache lookup, I don't know how much blocking would be a problem
[20:18] JamieD: isaacs: I clicked the Get the code. link on npmjs.org
[20:19] isaacs: JamieD: hm...
[20:19] tmzt: jade with live substitution changes would be awesome though

[20:21] JamieD: isaacs: ok, I'll give that a run
[20:23] JamieD: isaacs: should npm install ok if I run make install without sudo?
[20:24] isaacs: JamieD: no, probably won't.
[20:24] isaacs: JamieD: if you absolutely must do this, put `unsafe-perm = true` in ~/.npmrc

[20:27] isaacs: Bonuspunkt: reproducing.  not sure why
[20:27] isaacs: JamieD: not advisable.  but, if you want, then point your root, binroot, and manroot at user-owned folders, and set the `unsafe-perm` flag
[20:28] Bonuspunkt: isaacs yes i got npm ok
[20:28] sooli has joined the channel

[20:28] isaacs: ncb000gt: it downgrades perms now for package scripts
[20:29] isaacs: JamieD: what's require.paths, and what's npm config get root
[20:29] isaacs: JamieD: ie, do `require.paths` in the node repl
[20:29] ncb000gt: isaacs: yea, i saw that, just wanted to make sure i didn't recommend the wrong things

[21:01] mraleph: ryah: btw. I thought a bit about your fast long stack-traces. if you are willing to sacrifice precision and go "dirty" way you can do the following: memcpy top of the stack (say 100 words), then offload it's decoding into a separate thread. it should be pretty safe to do that decoding without sync, it mostly depends on immutable data, the only thing you need to catch is GC… do you plug a small syncronization barrier into GC prologue that either 
[21:01] softdrink: ok, plan Q....
[21:01] tjholowaychuk: whoever decided a non-string would be valid should be shot

[22:26] slaskis: if( ++counter == list.length ) done()
[22:26] tjholowaychuk: --pending || done()
[22:26] slaskis: yeah, well the idea is that callbacks also take errors though
[22:26] tjholowaychuk: is what I like to do
[22:26] slaskis: tjholowaychuk: ah, nice. you're full of little js tricks aren't ya?
[22:26] tjholowaychuk: slaskis: yup :)
[22:27] slaskis: using that ~"".indexOf() thing now
[22:27] davidsklar has joined the channel
[22:27] tjholowaychuk: i got that one from someone else
[22:27] tjholowaychuk: not sure who
[22:27] tjholowaychuk: saw it in a ruby script i think
[22:27] tjholowaychuk: but its all over
[22:28] slaskis: ah
[22:28] slaskis: arghs, i'm getting frustrated with this, i wonder if it's a bug in the fs module or if i'm just retarded
[22:29] slaskis: i should try to isolate it i guess
[22:29] isaacs: srid: here's how i do that in npm: https://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/lib/utils/async-map.js
[22:29] isaacs: srid: that's a bit more complex, since i also get the list of results
[22:29] isaacs: ;

[22:31] jklabo: I am getting an unterminated string literal error on windows/cygwin but not on mac with the same code in both places, anyone seen this problem?
[22:32] tmzt: tjholowaychuk: yeah I did, I did res.redirect(302, '/shorturl')
[22:32] tmzt: but it didn't change in the browser
[22:32] tmzt: also, with express, how do I make the sesion cookie work across subdomains?
[22:32] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: other way around http://expressjs.com/guide.html#res-redirect-url-status-
[22:33] tjholowaychuk: res.redirect('/foo', code)
[22:33] tmzt: ok
[22:33] tjholowaychuk: 302 is the default

[22:38] jklabo: no, node works ok if i am just running a test server or somethign
[22:38] juan77: hi isaacs, I have sent a mail to npm-@googlegroups.com, about an error installing mysql-libmysqlclient hope I missing something....

[22:45] isaacs: npm-
[22:45] isaacs: you need the -
[22:45] bradleymeck: does node's shebang detection handle arguments?
[22:45] isaacs: you also may need to join the group
[22:45] isaacs: bradleymeck: what do you mean?
[22:45] isaacs: bradleymeck: you mean, can you do `#!/usr/local/bin/node debug` as your shebang?
[22:45] bradleymeck: yea
[22:45] isaacs: yes.
[22:45] juan77: ahhh, ok isaacs, thanks.
[22:45] isaacs: and it's not node that does that, but the shell.
[22:45] bradleymeck: well expose_gc but the same
[22:46] isaacs: bradleymeck: yeah
[22:46] isaacs: bradleymeck: your script won't see those args, though
[22:46] isaacs: bradleymeck: node strips them off.
[22:46] bradleymeck: bleh, i was hoping the main module would consume them, makes sense i guess

[22:52] trentm has joined the channel
[22:52] ryah: tjholowaychuk: is it hard to do?
[22:52] ryah: :)
[22:52] ryah: should just bit a little hack, or?
[22:53] tjholowaychuk: ryah: nah, just need to inherit from https.Server and retire the middleware passed to createServer(foo,bar,baz)
[22:53] tjholowaychuk: was never a fan of that anyway
[22:53] ryah: ok
[22:53] tjholowaychuk: can you set the options via some method? or only createServer() ?
[22:53] McConnell has joined the channel
[22:54] snearch has joined the channel
[22:54] tjholowaychuk: if that is the case inheriting should be enough, then just connect.createServer().setWhatever({})
[22:58] kkaefer: for some reason, libeio invokes my EIO_Prepare callback, but not the EIO_AfterPrepare callback
[22:58] kkaefer: anyone ever experienced that?
[22:59] ChrisPartridge has joined the channel
[22:59] kkaefer: the function names in the eio_custom call are correct

[23:00] kkaefer: (node's also at 100% cpu)
[23:01] kkaefer: hah, found it already
[23:01] kkaefer: had a loop in the v8 process that didn't terminate, so it would never call the callback

[23:12] bob2 has joined the channel
[23:12] mjr_: ryah: it still happens from time to time, mostly when I restart things.
[23:12] mjr_: So it's probably related to an outgoing connection closing
[23:12] nonnikcam has joined the channel
[23:13] mjr_: But it's hard to say,because there is a lot of stuff happening all at once.
[23:13] mjr_: Which is why Ihaven't been able to isolate this into a test.
[23:13] mraleph: ryah: mjr_: nowdays if you see something that can't possibly happen (like having a null in variable after assert) and you are running ia32 version of node — do a run with —noopt. just to be sure :-)
[23:13] mjr_: Oh,I'll try that.
[23:14] mjr_: I think ryah said that the asserts were getting pre-processed out though.
[23:14] mjr_: Is that true, ryah?
[23:14] ryah: that's true
[23:15] ryah: https://github.com/ry/node/blob/0474ce67908c9afddab69d3f0eb53564b10e2ad1/wscript#L604

[23:17] robmason has joined the channel
[23:17] trotter has joined the channel
[23:17] mraleph: but keep that in mind for a future. as we support more and more JS features in the optimizing pipeline, you might start seeing some weird things.

[23:22] muk_mb has joined the channel
[23:23] ryah: mjr_: it would be interesting to stick a console.trace() into OutgoingMessage.prototype.detachSocket

[23:24] mjr_: OK, I'll try that.
[23:25] mjr_: First I'm going to walk down the beach and get a burger.
[23:25] mnot: mjr_: before you go - any plans to support dumping to a pcap save file?
[23:25] mjr_: mnot: I haven't had much time to work on pcap stuff lately, but I'd love to support pcap files as well as live capture
[23:25] mnot: mjr_: cool.
[23:26] ziro` has joined the channel
[23:26] mjr_: My top two priorities with pcap right now are to make jumping in on the middle of an HTTP sometimes work, as long as you see the first byte of a new request on an already open connection, and then to support the linux cooked if type, so -i any will work.
[23:26] slaskis: so, i finally figured out what the bad argument error comes from when i use ReadStream#resume(), here's an example: https://gist.github.com/832967
[23:27] mjr_: mnot: but if you want to contribute things to make offline work, I'm happy to pull them in.
[23:27] slaskis: is this the expected behaviour? ryah ^^
[23:27] mjr_: I need to do your entity encoding thing also that you already opened an issue on.
[23:27] slaskis: (using 0.4.0 btw)
[23:27] mnot: mjr_: ack
[23:28] ryah: slaskis: no
[23:28] ryah: slaskis: can you make a github issue?
