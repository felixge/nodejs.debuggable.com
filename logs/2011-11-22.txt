[00:24] tjholowaychuk: req.query is for GET
[00:24] tjholowaychuk: well for the querystring
[00:24] tjholowaychuk: you dont really want them in one object
[00:24] jstash: konobi: no new cow-orkers yet, only 2 pings
[00:24] slajax: yeah i got that far
[00:25] slajax: my problem right now is that bodyParser() doesn't seem to be populating the req.body
[00:25] tjholowaychuk: what's the request look like?
[00:25] tjholowaychuk: are you setting content-type appropriately?

[00:27] slajax: that's got the post body in it and line 8 shows console.log of req.body
[00:27] slajax: I think that is where I might be confused
[00:27] slajax: so yes iw ill
[00:28] tjholowaychuk: but that should be multipart/form-data
[00:28] tjholowaychuk: not application/x-www-form-urlencoded
[00:28] slajax: ok
[00:28] slajax: http://pastebin.com/3Z5cdyXH

[00:32] DrHeiter23 has joined the channel
[00:32] jstash: slajax: that's because changing the c-t turns it into a query, i'd think
[00:32] slajax: Yeah I'd like to handle POST and GET as close to the same way as possible
[00:32] jstash: wait... nevermind.
[00:32] jstash: i'm wrong.
[00:33] slajax: so I want bodyParser to parse the body then I'll extract params to an array that can be used n the rest of the app
[00:33] slajax: I just can't get the silly bodyParser to work right
[00:33] slajax: I think it's how I have my middle ware set up. some sort of stack order deal.
[00:34] springmeyer has joined the channel
[00:34] jstash: ah... sorry, don't use express.
[00:34] slajax: hmm seems like my issue is actually with the client, I can use vows to execute the post and it is received properly
[00:35] slajax: guess I'll need to look into bodyParser more closely
[00:35] slajax: thanks for trying jstash

[02:37] isaacs: c4milo: "data" events are not necessarily a full http 1.1 chunk.  it's based on how the data comes out of the socket.
[02:37] isaacs: the node parses out the http baggage, and stitches chunks together sometimes.
[02:37] isaacs: i could be wrong.  ryah would know.
[02:38] isaacs: but i believe the http 1.1 chunk boundary is just somewhat arbitrary framing.
[02:38] benvie: wow that's a quoteable
[02:38] c4milo1: I see 
[02:38] c4milo1: ryah: yt?

[02:38] isaacs: benvie: what, "i could be wrong.  ryah would know."?
[02:38] mjr_: I'm pretty sure that's right.  A data event can be much large than an HTTP chunk if I remember correctly.
[02:38] isaacs: oh, the immature stuff :)
[02:39] c4milo1: isaacs: thanks man, I'll take a look at the http.js code

[02:44] dejavu: do you know if there is a version of contextify connect express for windows...
[02:46] benvie: contextify, is that what you're asking for?
[02:46] benvie: because you came to the right person if so
[02:46] dejavu: yes
[02:47] benvie: https://github.com/Benvie/contextify is my fork which includes a project file to compile it on windows, and here is the precompiled binary https://github.com/Benvie/contextify/blob/master/build/Release/contextify.node
[02:47] CiRlE has joined the channel
[02:47] benvie: so wherever anything is bugging you for contextify
[02:47] benvie: npm probably will when it tries to built it with waf
[02:48] benvie: just get it not using npm, and use that
[02:48] isaacs: benvie: who owns contextify?
[02:48] isaacs: benvie: you should track down the author and get them to take your patch
[02:48] isaacs: benvie: not having jsdom on windows kind of hurts.
[02:48] dejavu: ok, thanks I will che that
[02:48] isaacs: !npm author contextify
[02:49] benvie: yeah I've contacted jsdom people at least with it, I haven't been able to get a response out of https://github.com/brianmcd/contextify
[02:49] isaacs: !npm info contextify
[02:49] dejavu: yes, at work I use under ubuntu
[02:49] dejavu: but at home, I want to try on windows...
[02:49] isaacs: sure sure
[02:49] benvie: yeah contextify is an easy one since it only uses calls to v8 stuff
[02:49] isaacs: there's a lot of programs that people write on jsdom that they can't do on windows
[02:49] benvie: so no platform issues
[02:49] isaacs: right
[02:49] inimino: isaacs ⋱ with tar-in-js?

[02:50] JakeyChan: https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever/issues/150
[02:50] isaacs: node-tar can't do everything I want it to, yet, and is less efficient than it needs to be, but it's coming along
[02:50] drfgf has joined the channel
[02:50] benvie: I'm not sure how to actually support precompiled windows stuff and there isn't support yet for the cross-platform build system
[02:50] benvie: so my fork has the binary
[02:50] konobi: isaacs++ # gots me set up with on-the-fly tarballs =0)
[02:51] isaacs: also, it needs docs, and fstream needs much better docs, and TONS of tests.
[02:51] benvie: it'd require a bit more work to have logic to either use node-waf or a binary
[02:51] isaacs: fstream is super powerful.
[02:51] BillyBreen has joined the channel
[02:51] benvie: or something that npm doesn't do either way

[02:52] isaacs: or maybe someone else as thought it out and just needs to convince me to take their patch ;)

[02:53] isaacs: yeah, benvie, you could just do that.
[02:53] benvie: I can upload contextify but then that wouldn't fix jsdom including the original
[02:53] benvie: and any other things
[02:53] benvie: mostly jsdom
[02:53] isaacs: benvie: contact tmpvar.
[02:53] isaacs: he's a super nice guy.
[02:54] rauchg has joined the channel
[02:54] isaacs: and (i think) a former windows user, so probably sympathetic to your pain :)
[02:54] benvie: well he's aware of it anyway https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/360
[02:54] benvie: I'm just not sure exactly where to go from there and I don't think he is either

[02:56] c4milo1: isaacs: it looks like http-parser takes care of the chunks  
[02:56] ypxu has joined the channel
[02:56] c4milo1: isaacs: "That is, a chunked encoding is decoded before being sent to the on_body callback."  from https://github.com/joyent/http-parser

[02:57] isaacs: konobi, benvie: i like to not get into such debates.  but, if you can email the author, and cc me on it, i can step in if they don't respond after a few weeks.
[02:57] Emmanuel` has joined the channel
[02:58] isaacs: benvie: i haven't seen your patch.  it might have some horrible bug, or do something terrible, i don't know.
[02:58] isaacs: :);
[02:58] isaacs: which is to say, if they have a good reason to reject it, then that may be fair.  but if they're just awol, then human intervention is justified.
[02:58] benvie: yeah understandable, I didn't expect it was just verbalizing the issues that exist
[02:58] benvie: basically this is a temporary issue
[02:58] isaacs: for sure
[02:58] isaacs: this process will take some hand-holding, i suspect.
[02:58] beejeebus-afk has joined the channel
[02:58] benvie: because this will go away when there's a unified build system
[02:59] benvie: but until then, yeah it's complicated
[02:59] isaacs: well, there'll be more annoying emails, anyway :)
[02:59] isaacs: i dunno about "go away" ;)
[02:59] benvie: hah
[02:59] benvie: yeah
[02:59] konobi: CPAN has a process for absentee authors
[02:59] benvie: well I think the expectation of compiling modules for windows isn't...going to happen
[02:59] benvie: it's just not
[02:59] benvie: it'll be binaries for windows and whatever for everything else
[02:59] konobi: and in previous cases when the original author(s) had died
[03:00] tiagobutzke has joined the channel
[03:00] benvie: and yeah that too
[03:01] amigojapan has joined the channel
[03:01] benvie: with npm being the gatekeeper for modules, which is de facto already is and de jur will be, there needs to be a process for killing off dead and unused stuff

[03:01] schwab: so is node.js c++ or js
[03:02] isaacs: schwab: lot of both :)
[03:02] benvie: node.js is a name because the word node is a terrible name for something you want to search for
[03:02] schwab: isaacs, ok
[03:02] schwab: why use javascript
[03:02] schwab: why not just pure c++ then
[03:02] konobi: don't forget blood, sweat and tears
[03:02] benvie: because otherwise it'd be node.ruby or maybe node.python
[03:02] isaacs: schwab: because js is so much nicer to write :)
[03:02] isaacs: schwab: node is a binding to v8, whcih is c++
[03:02] isaacs: (and js
[03:03] benvie: javascript is amazing to people who like javascript

[03:05] winterpk: Does anyone have any experience with comet programming and node?
[03:05] Lingerance: Comet is dead, use websockets.
[03:05] benvie: in the ##javascript I stated that javascript was good at event oriented programming (and then went AFK)
[03:05] benvie: when I came back I found that my statement was rebuked and had to explain that it largely was not a language feature
[03:06] winterpk: Lingerance: good to know.  Can you give me a quick explanation of websockets?
[03:06] futini has joined the channel
[03:06] blueadept: i think ##javascript is the overlow channel
[03:06] blueadept: so you were had
[03:06] benvie: but rather that the language has almost exclusively been used in contexts where it could not block and therefor the community and most code for it is written assuming that blocking isn't an option
[03:06] blueadept: rejoin #node.js
[03:06] benvie: could not block meaning if it did then it was viewed as broken
[03:07] benvie: AKA a blocking browser == frozen
[03:07] blueadept: just code
[03:07] blueadept: code and code and code
[03:07] blueadept: and when you're not done coding, code some more
[03:07] Vennril2 has joined the channel
[03:07] blueadept: thats the only way of understanding
[03:07] benvie: yeah man that's how I roll
[03:07] benvie: code for 72, sleep for 24
[03:07] blueadept: thats the only way
[03:07] blueadept: otherwise you're not for real

[03:08] richardr has joined the channel
[03:08] richardr: If I have a package.json, how do I tell npm to install all dependencies of defined? npm install -d ?
[03:08] isaacs: richardr: don't need the -d
[03:09] isaacs: richardr: why do people think that?
[03:09] isaacs: -d is to print debug info
[03:09] boltR has joined the channel
[03:09] Draco_ has joined the channel
[03:09] isaacs: -d = info, -dd = verbose, -ddd = silly
[03:09] jerrysv has joined the channel
[03:09] isaacs: is there a pkg manager that needs -d to install deps?
[03:11] mjr_: The word "reps" does start with the letter d.
[03:11] mjr_: er, deps
[03:11] benvie: quotable..
[03:11] benvie: we need a quote bot
[03:11] benvie: this is hurting me
[03:12] chilts: isaacs: sometimes I wonder if -d should be -v (for verbose)
[03:12] chilts: just a thought though
[03:12] chilts: :)
[03:12] isaacs: chilts: -v is already taken for --version
[03:12] mjr_: npm -c, rewrite in coffeescript
[03:12] chilts: ah ok
[03:12] isaacs: chilts: but --verbose works
[03:12] isaacs: mjr_: hahaha
[03:12] isaacs: yes!!!!
[03:12] isaacs: we need a shorthand for that
[03:12] isaacs: cuz it's too hard.
[03:12] mjr_: and it happens all the time

[03:17] Pritchard: I tried getting hello world running, made my own index.html to request the page and everything.

[03:28] tjholowaychuk: you can use v8's stack trace api

[03:30] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[03:30] tjholowaychuk: buu yeah by default you'll just get the .stack string, read up on that page
[03:30] buu: I am!
[03:30] isaacs: buu: don't just pass the error object to util.inspect or console.log
[03:30] buu: I would have expected a longer string
[03:30] buu: With numbers
[03:30] isaacs: buu: you have to actually get the stack
[03:30] isaacs: what you'er seeing is' a getter/setter property
[03:31] buu: Trying the prepare thing
[03:31] isaacs: buu: you have to coerce it to a string
[03:31] isaacs: buu: try this:  console.log(er.stack)
[03:31] isaacs: buu: or this:  console.log("The stack is %s", er.stack)

[03:43] diogogmt has joined the channel

[03:46] vkandy_: guys on 0.6.2, how does the master process terminate?
[03:46] Emmanuel` has joined the channel
[03:47] deoxxa: basically you do something like `mongo_getter.get_collection({collection: "mycollection", function(err, collection) { /* collection is open and ready to use */ })'
[03:47] deoxxa: it caches server/connection objects as well, to make things a bit quicker
[03:48] buu: deoxxa: Thanks, I'll check it out.
[03:49] buu: The sheer number of callbacks are kinda mind numbing =[
[03:49] deoxxa: yeah, that's something i got a bit tired of as well
[03:49] deoxxa: also it makes it hard when you want to lazily open connections
[03:49] buu: On a related note, is there someway to hook into an 'everything is idle now' event? I'm opening a mongodb connection, and I'd like to keep it around as long as things are happening, but once I've fallen off the end of my callstack, as it were, I'd like to close this connection so node ends

[05:14] Advant: zackattack: unfortantely my plate is full
[05:14] maxogden: sancas: nginx for example
[05:15] maxogden: sancas: so nginx would run on port 80 and route requests for different routes to your different frameworks servers (like django or rails) or node
[05:15] sancas: ok im gonna read about nginx to thks

[05:19] zackattack: i feel like if we had a listener rating system, people would have greater likelihood of having a positive experience
[05:20] deoxxa: it sounds like a relatively straightforward problem - the only issue being how you identify listeners
[05:20] maxogden: zackattack: have you explored text message/voice integration 
[05:21] zackattack: maxogden:  i haven't explored text message integration, though that would definitely be a cool option for people who prefer to text. a lot of teenagers use the site, they love to text.
[05:21] maxogden: some ruby on rails devs made a rails support hotline where you could put your cell number in and get routed calls from people looking for rails technical help
[05:21] maxogden: http://www.railshotline.com/

[06:15] davidedwardclark: Is irc.freenode.net the best IRC network for connecting with the nodejs community?
[06:15] ChrisPartridge: davidedwardclark: It most certainly is
[06:16] davidedwardclark: thanks Chris. I am asking because I am new to IRC and it is hard to know where to find what you are looking for with so many networks: efnet, undernet...
[06:17] maxogden: davidedwardclark: 'irc' by default means freenode these days
[06:17] maxogden: davidedwardclark: its one of those 'unless otherwise noted' kind of deals
[06:17] Lorentz: At least for "open source-y" things anyway
[06:17] davidedwardclark: really? what about efnet, IRCnet and under net? they have a ton of users still...
[06:18] Lorentz: Pretty much every FOSS-kinda project I've seen is on freenode.
[06:18] ChrisPartridge: davidedwardclark: as maxogden said, freenode is opensourcey
[06:19] davidedwardclark: thats what i heard, thanks for confirming

[12:18] tiagobutzke has joined the channel
[12:19] bnoordhuis: juniks: you're doing http.request() or http.get() somewhere but you don't do req.on('error', handler)
[12:20] bnoordhuis: so the exception bubbles up to the catch-all handler, process.on('uncaughtException', ...)
[12:20] bnoordhuis: davman: where/when do you get that error and with what version of node?
[12:21] flat: bnoordhuis: That's exactly what I need to trigger. Is there any known error the catch-all handler will fail to catch?
[12:21] bnoordhuis: juniks: EADDRINUSE is somewhat unexpected-ish unless you're making lots and lots of simultaneous connections

[12:21] dexter_e: Should there be a 'return' after every  res.end()  ? 
[12:22] dexter_e: Is this crucial ?
[12:22] davman: bnoordhuis: sorry yeah, was just doing a little bit more debugging. Hmm, so this is with 0.6.2, with Express from npm. Looks like when I pass a variable to res.end() it wasn't very happy...
[12:22] bnoordhuis: flat: normally, all exceptions should be caught
[12:22] davman: the variable reports as "object" if I do a typeof
[12:22] davman: and it has a toString()....
[12:22] sylvinus has joined the channel
[12:22] flat: bnoordhuis: Yeah, it used to work before 0.6.x. But inside events now, errors just cause node to hang.
[12:23] bnoordhuis: davman: not sure if express supports 0.6.x already
[12:23] bnoordhuis: davman: normally triggered assertions like that are bugs in node core but it's possibly that express uses undocumented / unsupported apis
[12:23] bnoordhuis: flat: 'inside events'?
[12:23] kriszyp3 has joined the channel
[12:24] davman: bnoordhuis: yeah I would have expected node to just say "can't do that with an object, give me a string"
[12:24] flat: What I mean is, if I trigger an event, and that event is a function that errors, then node will hang.
[12:24] davman: rather than die a death :D
[12:24] akihito_s has joined the channel
[12:24] davman: bnoordhuis: according to npm, express was updated 3 days ago, Engines requirement is node >= 0.4.1 < 0.7.0
[12:25] bnoordhuis: flat: can you gist an example?
[12:25] flat: bnoordhuis: Okay. I'll see how much I can simplify it and get back to you.
[12:25] bnoordhuis: davman: okay, maybe talk to tj, the author of express - if it's a bug in node he'll forward it to us
[12:26] davman: will do� trouble is the object is coming from *another* lib, so maybe its a malformed object
[12:26] davman: unlikely though, console.log is happy enough to print it

[16:42] gtramontina: global vars are never a good thing, IMO.
[16:43] gtramontina: you can have your 'data access layer'… or you could have an active record-like implementation.
[16:43] jesusabdullah: well
[16:43] jesusabdullah: not a global var, but a top-level var

[16:43] fairwinds: isaacs: hi ya. I am running into some trouble with minimatch. I am globbing to get all files and folders recursively. ie node_modules/** should give me all folders and files recursively
[16:44] klaemo: pksunkara: so I creat the connection once at app startup and attach it to process?
[16:44] pizthewiz has joined the channel
[16:44] pksunkara: yes
[16:44] jesusabdullah: A trick is to attach it to your "main" object, and then require the main lib from your sub-libs and then access main.db
[16:44] jesusabdullah: Not sure of that's "best practices" but it totally works
[16:44] isaacs: fairwinds: minimatch is not a file walker
[16:44] isaacs: fairwinds: it's strictly a string comparison lib
[16:44] isaacs: fairwinds: ie, it's fnmatch(3), not glob(3)
[16:44] klaemo: jesusabdullah: well, that's basically the same as attaching it to process
[16:45] jesusabdullah: except you still have to require it
[16:45] fairwinds: isaacs: right I realize. The previous glob package descended recursively
[16:45] jesster7 has joined the channel
[16:45] jesusabdullah: which is a good thing. I don't think strapping shit to your globals is a good idea
[16:45] isaacs: fairwinds: right
[16:45] jesusabdullah: typically
[16:45] igl has joined the channel
[16:46] jesster7 has left the channel
[16:46] jesusabdullah: It's generally good to be able to find the line where something was added to the namespace, imo
[16:46] isaacs: fairwinds: but this works as expected:

[16:46] dexter_e: klaemo: good question! I'm not sure if we have consensus yet :)
[16:46] pksunkara: yes, but how much overhead does that cost?
[16:46] jesusabdullah: Wait, what's causing overhead?
[16:47] dexter_e: I find that if a system is well modular you end up not needing to make lots of connections from lots of places 
[16:47] klaemo: dexter_e: i see, so it's not just me
[16:47] pksunkara: you know requiring and attaching
[16:47] fairwinds: isaacs: I have some deep trees
[16:47] isaacs: fairwinds: what string isnt' matching properly?  you have a test case?

[16:49] dexter_e: klaemo: I try to blackbox the database connections inside abstract models and then pass around and expose those models and connect to the db from within that module as if its not aware of the outside world. 
[16:50] fairwinds: isaacs: if I do node_modules/** it will descend to get folders at first level and the folders and files in these.
[16:50] fairwinds: shit sorry
[16:50] fairwinds: will get folders ie. node_modules/optimist","node_modules/request","node_modules/underscore",
[16:51] fairwinds: but not the folders and files contained in these
[16:51] buttface has joined the channel
[16:51] dexter_e: klaemo: but I'm still interested to see how the pros do it , as I am fairly new to node too!
[16:51] jesusabdullah: pksunkara: I'm not sure I see the overhead. I mean, it's another command right? But that's totally worth it from a bookkeeping standpoint
[16:51] jesusabdullah: and it's not like requires are known to be so totally slow
[16:51] pksunkara: yeah
[16:52] pksunkara: but in some cases, attaching it to process would be better
[16:52] simenbrekken has joined the channel
[16:52] fairwinds: isaacs: My projects are about 30MB min and contain binaries I am packaging also. So need this to work in a recursive way
[16:52] dexter_e: I think requires are just as fast as inline code the second time they run right ?
[16:52] pksunkara: but we don't encounter such cases
[16:52] jesusabdullah: Yeah, I was gonna say I'd imagine such a case is pretty rare
[16:52] isaacs: fairwinds: please share a full code sample.  minimatch does *zero* file system operations.
[16:53] isaacs: fairwinds: so, whatever is "descending recursively", it's not minimatch.
[16:53] isaiah_ has joined the channel
[16:53] isaacs: fairwinds: if you're doing fs.readdir, you'll have to stat those things, then do readdir on the ones that are directories, etc.

[16:58] isaacs: fairwinds: yes.
[16:58] tjholowaychuk: klaemo you can do whatever you want really
[16:58] tjholowaychuk: app could be a global with app.db as a connection
[16:58] isaacs: fairwinds: that's why minimatch isn't a glob replacement, but rather something that could be used in a pure-js node-glob implementation.
[16:58] tjholowaychuk: process.db whatever you want really

[16:58] isaacs: fairwinds: it's on my todo list.

[16:59] klaemo: tjholowaychuk ok, makes sense
[16:59] tjholowaychuk: klaemo assuming your app is not one that you expect others to require() that is
[16:59] fairwinds: isaacs: I likely have to do it this afternoon
[16:59] isaacs: fairwinds: patches welcome!!
[16:59] klaemo: tjholowaychuk no, it's not. 
[16:59] jesusabdullah: What's jake for, again?
[16:59] tjholowaychuk: globals in your own app are only "wrong" if you're clumsy

[17:03] ekryski has joined the channel
[17:03] tjholowaychuk: klaemo if you made it a global yeah
[17:03] klaemo: ok
[17:03] isaacs: jesusabdullah: so they invent stuff like rake and cake and jake and shake and bake
[17:03] jesusabdullah: fairwinds: So, like, "take these files, mash 'em together, minify/compress" ?
[17:03] fairwinds: but can use for anything really that you want. its all just js
[17:03] isaacs: fairwinds: you can do that in make, too ;)
[17:03] JakeSays: tjholowaychuk: so i ended up not porting your canvas to skia.. i just changed chromes canvas to render to a vector instead of a bitmap
[17:03] jesusabdullah: isaacs: Doesn't m4 have some weird crap with tabs? I remember that.
[17:03] fairwinds: that could be one use yes
[17:04] isaacs: jesusabdullah: make is the worst syntax.
[17:04] jesusabdullah: I'm all for not reinventing the wheel but, yeah, in their defense

[17:08] deedubs: isaacs: I'm also working on a rails project
[17:08] isaacs: oh, that explains it
[17:08] fairwinds: isaacs: sure. I guess bottom line is I want to do it all in js since I can use the code anywhere and require bits of code i have written anywhere
[17:08] isaacs: your perception is warped ;)
[17:08] deedubs: haha yes

[18:34] bluesmoon: baudehlo while that worked in the 0.5.x series, it doesn't appear to exist in 0.6.2
[18:34] ppcano has joined the channel
[18:35] sh1mmer: bluesmoon: I think they abstracted it
[18:35] sh1mmer: because you don't get access to direct unix sockets any more
[18:36] sh1mmer: doesn't bnoordhuis have a module for that now?
[18:36] baudehlo: bluesmoon: what about looking at socket.getRemoteAddress() ?
[18:37] bluesmoon: baudehlo unix domain sockets don't have a remoteAddress
[18:37] baudehlo: exactly.
[18:37] bluesmoon: so I could just assume that no remoteAddress == uds
[18:37] bluesmoon: but that would also be true for a socket that isn't connected
[18:37] baudehlo: or localAddress()
[18:38] bluesmoon: hmm, that's a thought
[18:38] madhums has joined the channel
[18:38] sh1mmer: bluesmoon: what's the case where you get a unix socket?
[18:38] baudehlo: yeah maybe youshould explain why you need to treat them differently
[18:38] sh1mmer: That's what I'm trying to say is I'm not sure libuv will hand you those any more
[18:39] bluesmoon: unix domain socket or socket opened to 127.0.0.1 is trusted, all other sockets are not trusted
[18:39] baudehlo: ah gotcha.
[18:39] sh1mmer: I think if you get unix sockets you have to get them outside of Node core via ben's library
[18:40] baudehlo: sh1mmer: no. That's UDP unix sockets.
[18:41] EhevuTov has joined the channel
[18:41] sh1mmer: oh
[18:41] bluesmoon: so apparently calling socket.address() on a unix domain socket will throw an exception
[18:42] bluesmoon: because Object #<Pipe> has no method 'getsockname'

[19:16] arlolra has left the channel
[19:17] DennisRasmussen has joined the channel
[19:17] marcello3d: port forwarding?
[19:17] marcello3d: so you can use port 80?
[19:17] gkatsev: yes
[19:17] mmalecki: yeah, setup an iptables rule to do 80 -> 8000 or whatever
[19:18] gkatsev: so... npm in node.
[19:18] marcello3d: mmalecki: gotcha, will look at that
[19:18] r1ngzer0 has joined the channel
[19:18] isaacs: gkatsev: it won't be "in" node.
[19:18] marcello3d: what about chroot?
[19:18] isaacs: gkatsev: it'll be installed alongside node by the binary distributions for os x and iwnodws
[19:19] mmalecki: gkatsev: not that I'm hatin', but it kinda worries me
[19:19] gkatsev: isaacs: that's perfectly fine. One less step for us when installing node. :)
[19:19] isaacs: mmalecki: you can start it as root, and then process.setuid() to someone else.
[19:19] isaacs: gkatsev: that's the idea :)
[19:19] gkatsev: and yeah, makes more sense to do it that way then really put it "in"
[19:20] marcello3d: isaacs: is there any reason to do that over the iptables route?
[19:20] mmalecki: isaacs: prolly. I don't like starting any app with sudo
[19:20] piscisaureus_ has joined the channel
[19:20] isaacs: mmalecki: then you should start it as "nobody"
[19:20] magnetik_: Just filled in : https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/2164

[19:20] EhevuTov has joined the channel
[19:20] isaacs: mmalecki: sure
[19:20] aliem has joined the channel
[19:21] isaacs: mmalecki: but, for instance, a lot of apps (npm included) will use a specific limited user when run as root
[19:21] mmalecki: isaacs: I know, I read the code
[19:21] isaacs: so your www exposed folders are owned by "www-data" or "httpd" or someone
[19:21] dubenstein has joined the channel

[19:21] isaacs: doesn't have a home dir, etc.

[19:22] marcello3d: ok now I'm more confused :D
[19:22] mmalecki: isaacs: limiting install to specific platform
[19:23] marcello3d: so make a user with no permissions except read access to the javascript, run sudo -u <thatuser> node server.js, then after I start listening, I use process.setuid() ?

[19:27] dnyy has joined the channel
[19:27] jocafa: what does the installer do, specifically?
[19:27] bemson has joined the channel
[19:27] marcello3d: probably copies binaries into path-friendly folders
[19:27] CoverSlide: ... installs node 
[19:27] jocafa: npm?
[19:27] magnetik_: On windows, it copies to a specified folder (can't change it), and then add the node.js path to the PATH env variable
[19:28] aliem has joined the channel
[19:28] isaacs: marcello3d: no, you'd just do `sudo node server.js` and in server.js, you'd do `process.setuid(<thatuser>)`.  you need to be root to change your uid.
[19:28] CoverSlide: can't change the folder? that's lame
[19:28] bemson: I've written my package.json, but not sure where I tell npm where my actual js file is… is that the "main" keyword?
[19:29] magnetik_: CoverSlide, I think it's the first version.. it will be improved
[19:29] pksunkara: bemson: yes
[19:29] isaacs: bemson: yessir.
[19:29] marcello3d: isaacs: ok that makes more sense. do you think that's better than the iptables approach and running as a regular user?
[19:29] magnetik_: For now, the PATH is changed in the wrong maner.. more critical ^^
[19:29] bemson: isaacs: so main would be "src/gendata.js"
[19:29] marcello3d: is there a way to give a specific user access to listen on a specific port?

[19:41] jesusabdullah: necromancer: I think you have to look at python from a historical perspective, and by its use cases
[19:42] jesusabdullah: First, a lot of people came to python from java
[19:42] jesusabdullah: in comparison, python is pretty limber I'd think
[19:42] jesusabdullah: You can see the influence in older libraries, like twisted, imo
[19:43] adrianF: hello, does somebody know, what is the advantage of adding functions with prototyping in comparison to add them directly within the exported WebClient function. here is an example (Log.io): https://github.com/NarrativeScience/Log.io/blob/master/lib/server/web_client.js
[19:43] jesusabdullah: I think python started filling a niche where people just wanted to get shit done, and you see a lot of pragmatic engineering types
[19:43] paq has joined the channel
[19:43] jesusabdullah: then there's numpy/scipy, which brings a *lot* of smart people to it, but smart people that are engineers and scientists first and software types second
[19:44] jesusabdullah: but the language geeks in python have the wrong idea imo
[19:44] jesusabdullah: and there are a lot of fanboys
[19:44] hotch: fanboys to the rescue!
[19:45] hotch: any language that borks on a whitespace/tab missing = the suck imo
[19:45] Dulak: they do tend to take things like pep8 and the zen of python as if they were religious texts.
[19:45] necromancer: well that's kind of the whole point with python isn't it hotch?
[19:45] necromancer: the concepts and ideals behind python are great though
[19:45] hotch: necromancer: what, sucking? :P
[19:45] jesusabdullah: Well, we *all* have fanboys, but when your fanboys are more busy coming up with weirdo generator expressions than finding ways to do reasonable multicore
[19:46] jesusabdullah: or fixing the module system
[19:46] jesusabdullah: I think the community's a bit broken
[19:46] hotch: yeah i do like it a lot minus the white space, i did use it a while.
[19:46] necromancer: hotch: "one way to do everything"
[19:46] hotch: jesusabdullah: node or python?
[19:46] necromancer: that's nice :)
[19:46] bemson: i installed something locally, and now I can't remove it
[19:46] hotch: hah necromancer :P
[19:46] bemson: I only have one thing installed
[19:46] bemson: i'm in the same dir where I installed it
[19:46] necromancer: like i said the IDEALS are great
[19:47] hotch: out of a long time working from java, c, perl, python, php now node, -> node is superior with npm / it's module system.
[19:47] bemson: i did "npm install", which looked the local package.json, and now tried "npm rm" to no avail
[19:47] isaacs: hotch: thanks :)
[19:47] Dulak: I don't see the problem with the whitespace,  my js looks very much like my python when I am coding it to be pretty, so it's not much of a point, imo.
[19:47] isaacs: bemson: yeah, `npm rm` with no args doesn't remove all your deps.
[19:47] necromancer: hotch: lol i don't know if this is totally related, but my co-worker just figured out that he's been using prototypal inheritance this whole time. every time you make a jQuery plugin? i asked him to evaluate (jQuery.fn === jQuery.prototype) in console
[19:47] hotch: the little things like npm init, npm test (no more make files? :P) npm publush
[19:47] isaacs: bemson: you can `rm -rf node_modules` though
[19:47] hotch: heheh necromancer 
[19:47] bemson: isaacs: will do, thx
[19:48] bemson: do i need to reinstall an npm module whenever I change my code? This is local only...
[19:48] hotch: isaacs: i often joke at the office that you must just be on irc/issuing on node/coding revision 347 of branch 0.5 etc :P
[19:49] hotch: necromancer: have you ever seen paul irishs hour vid walking through all of the query source (minus sizzle which is insane) ?
[19:49] isaacs: bemson: if you're developing two modules, and you're on a unix, read `npm help link`
[19:49] isaacs: bemson: re-installing for every change is too painful.
[19:49] bemson: isaacs: on it, thx
[19:49] necromancer: hotch: nope

[19:57] jesusabdullah: I think node suffers a little from haters. People got excited about a "good" platform and didn't want to see a good thing go bad, so sometimes when a new project comes along we like to get on their case about being "too much like rails" or whatever else
[19:58] jesusabdullah: all in all a good community though

[20:47] joshsmith: mjr_: but, but hello, world!
[20:47] mjr_: In order to be cross-platform, some things have to come out of node and be pushed into modules.
[20:47] TheJH: mmalecki, oh, right
[20:48] mjr_: You can still run hello world without ever running npm

[20:57] marcello3d: yea
[20:57] benvie: steps: 1
[20:57] benvie: I think it's awesome
[20:57] mjr_: I think it's a great idea.  Installing npm is a pain, in spite of all isaacs' efforts to make it easy

[20:58] benvie: considering we all get it anyway
[20:58] marcello3d: maybe it's not. maybe mmalecki is just trolling ;D
[20:58] benvie: the instructions for node are 1.) get node 2.) get npm
[20:58] baudehlo: I'll be glad when I don't have to pipe non-secure http into "sudo sh" any more :)
[20:58] benvie: so now it's just 1
[20:58] marcello3d: baudehlo: yea, that always scared the crap out of me

[22:24] mehtryx has joined the channel
[22:24] xeodox: tanepiper: can you walk me through some of the needs?
[22:24] marcello3d: it'd help if there was more info on this log message: The "sys" module is now called "util". It should have a similar interface. 
[22:24] EhevuTov_ has joined the channel
[22:24] context: doesn't appear to work in ff either
[22:24] xeodox: tanepiper: I need this for a large proaction project (millions of users)
[22:24] tjholowaychuk: marcello3d haha those are hard to track down sometimes
[22:24] xeodox: production*
[22:24] tanepiper: xeodox: not really, but there is plenty on google about understanding migrations
[22:25] xeodox: ahh i see
[22:25] marcello3d: `forever` logs it
[22:25] tanepiper: if you don't know if you need them, you probably need to do some research
[22:25] marcello3d: but it has like 20 dependencies, so who knows
[22:25] tjholowaychuk: marcello3d yeah, i had a hard time finding some of mine too, really need line numbers
[22:25] marcello3d: shouldn't be hard to figure out
[22:26] tjholowaychuk: try acking ./node_modules
[22:26] marcello3d: just make the log message do a (new Error).stack parsing
[22:26] marcello3d: I do it for my log library
[22:26] klaemo has joined the channel
[22:26] tanepiper: tjholowaychuk: stop releasing cool stuff the day AFTER I need it :p
[22:26] marcello3d: (e.g. var log = require('foo')())
[22:27] tjholowaychuk: tanepiper :D it would have been finished a lot sooner but i didnt have much time for it
[22:27] tjholowaychuk: just the odd hour or two a week
[22:27] tjholowaychuk: if even
[22:27] xeodox: tjholowaychuk, what do you think is the best node.js mysql driver?
[22:28] ecin has joined the channel
[22:28] tjholowaychuk: xeodox no clue i haven't touched mysql for a few years
[22:28] robotmay has joined the channel
[22:28] bluesmoon: xeodox I'd suggest "mysql"
[22:28] bluesmoon: npm install mysql
[22:28] bluesmoon: it doesn't have any dependencies on C libraries
[22:28] xeodox: bluesmoon:  yea thats the one i am planning on using
[22:29] fmeyer has joined the channel
[22:29] xeodox: bluesmoon: have you used SQLAlchemy before?
[22:29] chjj: felix's mysql is good
[22:29] bluesmoon: nope
[22:29] xeodox: chjj, have u used SQLAlchemy or Django orm before?
[22:29] bluesmoon: but felix is a pretty active developer, and his code is good
[22:29] xeodox: ahh i see
[22:29] chjj: xeodox: nope
[22:30] mehtryx has joined the channel
[22:31] gabaug has joined the channel
[22:31] xeodox: chjj, bluesmoon, felix's "mysql" allows me to do queries…but  how should I manage my schema then?
[22:31] xeodox: In the past (rails, django), I used their ORM and was able to define schemas very well, and do migrations too
[22:32] tanepiper: nodejs hooks needed! https://github.com/TTimo/doom3.gpl

[22:42] marcello3d: weird. forever doesn't include timestamps in its logs...?
[22:43] marcello3d: seems like something you'd want
[22:43] quackquack: Marak: suggestion: could you remove `html { overflow-y: scroll; }` from the flatiron doc site css? it causes a double scroll bar  (in chrome)
[22:43] tjholowaychuk: isaacs do you know if we could get rid of "zeromq" in npm? the same guy has "zmq" which has the most activity
[22:43] quackquack: :)
[22:43] tjholowaychuk: but it's broken all the time
[22:43] mehtryx has joined the channel
[22:43] EhevuTov__ has joined the channel
[22:43] tjholowaychuk: so i wouldnt mind pushing one to "zeromq"
[22:44] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: ask the owner to move it away, if the same guy has two that are dupes
[22:44] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: email, cc me, if he doesn't respond in a few weeks, email me and i'll take care of it
[22:44] tjholowaychuk: k
[22:44] tjholowaychuk: will do
[22:44] isaacs: it's the holidays, so it could take a while

[23:03] isaacs: got an example you're seeing?  i'm not grokking this
[23:03] harthur has joined the channel
[23:03] tanepiper: yea, actually i think i mis-understood the issue myself from bnoordhous's explination
[23:04] isaacs: hm... ok.
[23:04] isaacs: the "path" member was added so you could do http.get(url.parse(...))
[23:04] tanepiper: Basically I had an identical bit of code that worked in 0.6, but didn't in 0.4.12 due to the url.parse object in 0.4.12 missing the .path member
[23:04] tanepiper: yea
[23:04] isaacs: right
[23:04] isaacs: yeah, that didn't work in 0.4
[23:04] mcluskydodallas has joined the channel
[23:05] tanepiper: basically when you called the bitly api in 0.4 the return was a ngnix 301 redirect page
[23:05] devongovett has joined the channel
[23:05] grampajoe has joined the channel
[23:05] isaacs: right
[23:05] tanepiper: must have been hitting the wrong URL since .path was missing, but it was late and i was looking at the issue wrong
[23:06] isaacs: well... node shouldn't follow redirects automatically
[23:06] madhums has joined the channel
[23:06] tanepiper: yea :)  the proper API url doesn't redirect - but the bug came in and it was late, but i was determined to fix it 
[23:07] tanepiper: at least it's got me writing tests now for travisCI :p
[23:07] isaacs: ahhh, i get it now.
[23:07] isaacs: thanks.
[23:07] isaacs: i was worried that something in node was busted
[23:07] tanepiper: https://github.com/tanepiper/node-bitly/blob/master/bitly.js#L55
[23:07] tanepiper: that fixed it for 0.4

[23:36] SteveDekorte: any suggestions?
[23:36] SteveDekorte: this is on OSX 10.7.2
[23:37] wankdanker: this sys module warning is a different issue than the seg fault
[23:37] wankdanker: i am not running osx, but saw something around about a segfault happening in osx. how did you install?
[23:38] te-brian2: trying to figure out nconf ... why is my test printing 'undefined'?  https://gist.github.com/1387428
[23:39] te-brian2: the 'fallbacks' do not appear to be merging...
[23:40] context: stevedekorte: is this all node scripts or one in particular
[23:40] context: does it happen instantly ?
[23:40] SteveDekorte: wankdanker: git clone ...; git checkout v0.6.2; ./configure; make; sudo make install
[23:41] yogurt_truck has joined the channel
[23:41] context: pretty sure you have to tell it to use llvm (i think it is)
[23:41] context: or use something like homebrew
[23:41] SteveDekorte: context: happens when I try to run vertex.js, which ran fine under an earlier version of node

[23:46] ryah: SteveDekorte: you're hitting our major bug right now
[23:46] SteveDekorte: hey ryan
[23:47] ryah: SteveDekorte: if you could report a stacktrace of the segfault here https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/2061
[23:47] ryah: it would be helpful
[23:47] SteveDekorte: btw, the crypto package also needs support for assymetric key generation
[23:47] ryah: SteveDekorte: yeah, i think it's lacking lots of things. patches welcome :)
[23:48] SteveDekorte: posted the stack trace
[23:49] SteveDekorte: in the meantime, I wrote a binding to do key generation via the openssl command line - the problem is that there are no sync child_process calls and the async breaks the rest of the program :
[23:49] SteveDekorte: as this is happening during a transaction
[23:50] SteveDekorte: oddly, the filesystem calls have sync versions
[23:50] SteveDekorte: why does one have a sync version but the other does not?
[23:50] ryah: we're working on adding a sync child process execution

[23:55] mjr_: The most common support issue I have with redis is people upgrading node and the hiredis module not getting re-compiled or they have two versions of the module on their computer.
[23:56] mjr_: It'd be great if there were some magic number you could check before dlopen that would blow up with a "binary version mismatch" error unless they matched exactly.
