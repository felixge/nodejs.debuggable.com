[00:29] ryah: Stephen: it's very alpha right now
[00:29] rhdoenges: ryah: stay sane :D
[00:30] ryah: doesn't support a lot of APIs like child_process
[00:30] ryah: it'll get better over the next few weeks
[00:30] isaacs: Stephen: if you wnat to help the project, use 0.5 on windows and get ready to find bugs and make patches.  if you wanna get stuff done, use 0.4 on not-windows.
[00:30] Stephen: Cool, I'm gonna lurk here while I drive my butt home
[00:30] ryah: we're releasing v0.5.2 tomorrow with named pipe support
[00:30] rhdoenges: ryah: also, for building win from source, I need to install cygwin/mingw, yeah?
[00:30] Stephen: Actually, I need to stick with a stable version
[00:30] ryah: and child process support in v0.5.3 hopefully
[00:30] tonymilne has joined the channel
[00:30] ryah: rhdoenges: to build you need mingw/msys

[00:33] rhdoenges: no, no, it was the capslock :)
[00:33] Nuck: I think EventEmitters are teh best event implementation ever
[00:34] Stephen: Didn't they just remove that?

[00:35] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: That they don't
[00:35] Stephen: Just needed 1 language to communicate across Firefox Extension, Server, and DB
[00:35] Stephen: jQuery made for a nice smoothing tool
[00:35] Stephen: I'm sure there's a little overhead, but it couldn't be much
[00:35] Nuck: Mongo + Node + jQuery
[00:35] Stephen: Yup

[00:36] Nuck: I haven't used it on a large scale yet, but I know it's supposed to bewebscale
[00:36] Nuck: Why does isntalling a gem mean also installing ri and rdoc documentation?
[00:36] Nuck: Fuck the Manuals.
[00:36] rhdoenges: the important question is this:
[00:37] rhdoenges: why is most of `gem install` output telling me it installed some docs?
[00:37] Nuck: Well, fuck any manuals that take longer to install than the package itself
[00:37] __directory: Nuck you can tell it not to install ri/rdoc
[00:37] Nuck: __directory: Please, tell me.
[00:37] Nuck: It's getting rather annoying
[00:37] Nuck: Especially since it installs BOTH docs.
[00:38] telemachus: Nuck: This in $HOME/.gemrc gem: --no-ri --no-rdoc
[00:38] Nuck: Which is extremely silly.
[00:38] __directory: its --no-ri and --no-rdoc

[00:51] rwaldron has joined the channel
[00:51] random123: devaholic: Yes, I am using socket.io for the realtime communication (chat mostly) but I am wondering if I should serve static content with it as well, since it is capable, or is that worse perfomance than jQuery.ajax for instance?

[00:52] tonymilne: random123 I'm doing what you've described. Not sure yet whether it's better just yet. ;)
[00:53] tonymilne: random123 but stuff is written such that i could probably switch between ajax / socket without much pain.

[00:55] random123: tonymilne, I wonder if it does offer a performance boost or penalty, I can go either way right now, I can see it even being faster since it uses WebSockets in newer browsers, and I don't know if jQuery does that, or if its better performance
[00:55] bnoguchi: random123: It depends on the transport. I think jQuery.ajax might be more performant than socket.io when they both are using http, not websocket
[00:56] bnoguchi: random123: Because socket.io has the additional overhead of framing
[00:57] random123: bnoguchi if socket.io has WebSockets avaliable in the browser then it would def. be quicker than jQuery.ajax?
[00:57] bnoguchi: random123: If the transport is websocket, I believe it depends on the data payload size.
[00:57] bnoguchi: random123: I don't believe that websocket has gzip support in browsers
[00:57] bnoguchi: random123: So you don't get the benefit of gzip. But you do get the benefit of not having to send headers on every request as you do with http.
[00:58] bnoguchi: random123: I would also look into spdy, if you are thinking about serving up static content. It's also supported in chrome.

[02:02] dreamdust: That would be awesome.
[02:02] tmzt: or trace through callbacks better (when they are unrelated to what went wrong)
[02:03] tmzt: like treat a set of callbacks a scope, when you have something happening related to an event or mongo lookup but it's directly related it can be confusing having them in the stack trace

[02:17] Nuck: Somebody port redmine to Node for me D:

[02:26] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: it's pretty cool, it uses green threads to completely hide any async action -- so your code doesn't have to change to make it async.

[02:29] chrisdickinson: ACTION wonders out loud if that's anywhere near possible in vanilla js
[02:29] sammmy: tjholowaychuk: functions in JS can have multiple stacks though.
[02:30] piscisaureus: soccer
[02:30] sammmy: does that mean that JS functinons are coroutines?
[02:30] chrisdickinson: sammmy: js only runs one stack at a time.
[02:30] tjholowaychuk: vanilla js only has one stack
[02:31] d0k has joined the channel
[02:31] sammmy: Hmm. But in order to have multiple stacks in JS you would need to run multiple instances of a script?
[02:31] tjholowaychuk: sammmy: the reason apps using coros *look* sync is because you can yield on a blocking action and jump into another stack to do some work
[02:31] jonaslund: sammmy: basically what you have is user managed stacks
[02:32] kartmetal: isn't spidernode able to do exactly that?
[02:32] rauchg has joined the channel
[02:32] jonaslund: windows/*nix has C level co-routine libs (but different apis) and there's a fair number of personal hacks aswell
[02:33] sammmy: tjholowaychuk: so what apps use coroutines; is there a Node library that follows this pattern?
[02:33] isaacs: so, you know how the find(1) unix utility can take a list of expressions, and even stuff like -name foo.* -or -path baz*boo?
[02:33] isaacs: and parens and stuff?
[02:33] jonaslund: the simplest way would prolly to do a JS-JS translator
[02:33] isaacs: if you had a require("find"), what would be the best way to have that work?
[02:33] rhdoenges has joined the channel
[02:33] bnoordhuis: kartmetal: maybe, spidermonkey has support for generators at least
[02:34] isaacs: i'm tempted to just do find = require("find"); find(folder, { name: "foo.*", path: "baz*foo" }, cb), and forget about "or" and parens altogether.
[02:34] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: hmmMm.. mayble a variable number of strings and/or { name: foo } type args
[02:34] isaacs: what do you guys thing?
[02:34] tjholowaychuk: not sure

[02:34] isaacs: hehe
[02:35] isaacs: so find(dir, {name:"*.js"}, {name:"foo.*"}, cb)
[02:35] kartmetal: bnoordhuis, what else would you need to get "real" co-routines? you'd have a yield operator.. you'd just need a main function that keeps circling through the relevant coroutines, right?
[02:35] isaacs: woudl that *only* find foo.js files?
[02:35] isaacs: or are they or-ed together?
[02:35] bnoordhuis: kartmetal: the idea is that coroutines can pass values to each other
[02:35] isaacs: and how would you do:  -name *foo.* -name *blah*
[02:35] tjholowaychuk: I'd probably expect that to |
[02:35] kartmetal: ooh.

[02:39] kartmetal: not a very nodish style, arguably.
[02:39] chjj: crossing into jquery territory
[02:40] jesusabdullah: I don't think there's such thing as "nodish style" really
[02:40] chjj: "chain everything, put everything on the prototype of one constructor"
[02:40] chjj: etc
[02:40] jesusabdullah: function chaining isn't a bad approach at all
[02:40] kartmetal: bnoordhuis, reading that stuff makes me want to see it in node.js proper.. can we bribe the v8 team to add more crazy goodness like that?
[02:41] bnoordhuis: kartmetal: i know what you mean :)
[02:41] isaacs: kartmetal: no. :)
[02:41] isaacs: kartmetal: i have a find util that i use in npm quite a bit.  it just takes a regexp.  it's great.
[02:42] isaacs: i mean, it's not great, butit's ok.  it sorta works.
[02:42] kartmetal: jesusabdullah, kinda. If there's an underlying implementation that can leverage that chaning rather than just cheat and pile it on a big stack until it ends with a .run(callback) method, i'd be an easier sell.
[02:42] tjholowaychuk: isaacs haha actually yeah regexp sounds a lot better, simple.
[02:43] kartmetal: isaacs, it is simpler, but it doesn't capture the whole richness of the unix find tool.
[02:43] isaacs: yeah
[02:43] kartmetal: then again, it'd usually be enough for my puny uses of the tool.
[02:43] tjholowaychuk: meh
[02:43] isaacs: the thing is, with the unix tool, you can actually stream filenames through, switch between stat and lstat, etc.
[02:44] jesusabdullah: kartmetal: Oh yeah, definitely
[02:44] isaacs: i think what i'll do is just take an arbitrary list of either globs, regexps, or functions.  the functions can be async, or can return true or false immediately.
[02:44] tjholowaychuk: i'll take simple and restrictive over powerful and complicated any day
[02:44] isaacs: and then the final cb gets a list of what matched.
[02:44] tmzt: jquery for the filesystem
[02:44] tmzt: :)
[02:45] isaacs: so you could do find(folder, "foo.*", function (er, foos) { ... })
[02:45] isaacs: no combinatorix 
[02:45] kartmetal: at that point, is the implementation doing more than a findEverything(folder).filter(function(){...}) ?
[02:45] isaacs: i would like a bin that has feature parity with the unix util, though
[02:45] isaacs: kartmetal: yes.
[02:46] isaacs: there may be many many millions on files in there, and you just want the foos.
[02:46] kartmetal: well yes you get the regexp filter at least.
[02:46] kartmetal: ok
[02:46] isaacs: kartmetal: or you may want to do something like:  find(dir, "foo.*", function (file, cb) { rm(file, cb) }, cb) to remove all the foos
[02:47] tmzt: like dir('.').children([/.*express.*/,/\*.js/).requireAll()
[02:47] tmzt: or something
[02:47] isaacs: ACTION isn't all that thrilled by function chaining
[02:48] tjholowaychuk: tmzt a dom-like approach would be kinda neat
[02:48] tjholowaychuk: progressive apis ftw
[02:48] isaacs: passing along state in an opaque object is tricky to get right.  jquery does an ok job, but even then, I usually just do $(selector).doSomethign()
[02:48] kartmetal: fs.getFileByName("..")? :'(
[02:48] isaacs: you can build that on top of the find(..., cb) api anyhow
[02:49] isaacs: my eventual goal here is to replace node-glob with something that's 100% js, and split out everything generic from npm's util folder.

[03:39] random123: Forget socket.io, not important, but real time communication in general, where you don't want to put that information in a database, you just want to keep it in memory so you can push it to X client faster

[08:22] Nuck: I want to have user uploads and such
[08:22] Nuck: But I'm not sure how often to clean it, etc.
[08:23] Nuck: I assume doing a timer per upload would be bad
[08:23] AAA_awright: Do you need to store it as a file?
[08:23] AAA_awright: Nuck: Or just go the Flash route, create a tempfile, unlink it, but keep the file pointer around so it's still on disk
[08:23] Nuck: huh?
[08:24] Nuck: That's an interesting thing, how do I do that?
[08:24] Nuck: AAA_awright: Any example for that?
[08:24] AAA_awright: Alright there's two ways I know of, first of is mktmp
[08:24] Nuck: It needs to be written to the proper location after a while
[08:24] AAA_awright: or mktemp system call
[08:24] Nuck: hmm
[08:25] AAA_awright: Nuck: It's also possible to create a file, unlink it, but keep the file descriptor around and continue to write to it, that's actually valid to do
[08:25] pgte has joined the channel
[08:25] AAA_awright: Node.js does not appear to have http://linux.die.net/man/1/mktemp
[08:25] Nuck: The thing is, I'm taking uploads as a raw bytestream lodged into an HTTP POST
[08:26] Nuck: So I pipe to a file
[08:26] Nuck: Can I still do that?
[08:26] AAA_awright: Should work
[08:26] hassox has joined the channel
[08:26] AAA_awright: If you want a filename later you should be able to create a new hardlink
[08:26] Nuck: I'm not a linux person, I'm afraid I don't know what you mean by hardlink
[08:27] Nuck: AAA_awright: I'm sure there's an mktemp in npm :P
[08:27] AAA_awright: Nuck: Probably
[08:28] AAA_awright: Nuck: A file is really just a pointer to hard disk space, and if you have a hardlink to a file, they appear as two files with different permissions and filenames and everything, but the contents point to the same location on disk
[08:28] AAA_awright: So if you hardlink to a file, it's creating a new filename reference
[08:28] AAA_awright: I presume you can hardlink to a file on disk with zero references
[08:28] AAA_awright: and create a normal file
[08:28] AAA_awright: Nuck: This is as opposed to a symlink which is just a pointer to another filename
[08:29] Nuck: https://github.com/bruce/node-temp
[08:29] AAA_awright: Best to google it, or "man ln"
[08:29] AAA_awright: Like so http://linux.die.net/man/1/ln
[08:30] AAA_awright: http://linux.die.net/man/2/link is the command that hardlinks
[08:30] AAA_awright: unlink(2) - delete a name and possibly the file it refers to
[08:31] AAA_awright: Note "possibly" the file it refers to
[08:31] Nuck: fs.link(srcpath, dstpath, [callback])
[08:31] skohorn has joined the channel

[08:32] AAA_awright: Nuck: What exactly do you have in mind, I suppose once you accept the upload you want to relocate it over the network to a static file server right?
[08:32] Nuck: Somebody make me a module that provides mktemp
[08:33] Nuck: AAA_awright: I was talking to my host and he told me that can be dealt with using a regular directory
[08:33] Nuck: And a network fs I assume
[08:33] akiva has joined the channel
[08:34] Nuck: AAA_awright: But yes, it wil end up on a static file server
[08:34] Aiden has joined the channel
[08:34] narayan82 has joined the channel
[08:34] AAA_awright: And you want to thumbnail/scale/recompress some of the files too
[08:35] AAA_awright: That can be done on the static server as a slave process I guess
[08:35] AAA_awright: Nuck: Yeah maybe nfs would be easiest, otherwise you're programming for sftp
[08:36] Nuck: my host is a smart man
[08:36] Nuck: He's yet to lead me wrong :P
[08:36] AAA_awright: He can probably offer more relevant advice than I can
[08:37] Nuck: lol
[08:37] Nuck: I didn't think about thumbnailing though :S
[08:37] akiva has joined the channel
[08:39] AAA_awright: I imagine you have a local database of all the images, and you query it "Hey which server are you on" and it replies back "I'm on a.static.example.com" and it has a simple API, and you say "Hey make sure you have thumbnailed this upload" and if not it adds it to a queue, maybe sends a callback once the process is done
[08:39] AAA_awright: More Node.js server but it can't be that complex, right? :p
[08:40] Nuck: Or I could just use a distributed setup :P
[08:40] Nuck: Actually, how WOULD I do thumbs in Node?
[08:40] AAA_awright: That's exactly what I have in mind
[08:40] AAA_awright: If you had multiple static file servers, they can all do their own thumbnails
[08:40] Nuck: I mean I'd just thumb it on submit
[08:40] AAA_awright: Nuck: Probably delegate out to imagemagick
[08:40] Nuck: And then shove it to a fileserver
[08:41] Nuck: I'll hafta brose NPM
[08:41] AAA_awright: Transfer the image to the static server, and have it do the scale locally when it's not over load
[08:41] Nuck: Well, it may get requested quickly
[08:41] Nuck: I expect I can delegate the task elsewhere later on

[08:45] Nuck: There are no canvases on the Server, AFAIK.
[08:45] AAA_awright: I think there is
[08:45] AAA_awright: I was going to use one to use a client-side plotting library to render a plot server-side if necessary
[08:46] SubStack: rawk
[08:46] AAA_awright: But you still have to muck around with resolution and output format and whatnot... convert is pretty simple, -resize 320x320 and done.
[08:46] SubStack: AAA_awright: use mrcolor!
[08:46] SubStack: for the colors
[08:46] devaholic: then use phantomjs if you have to, but it cannot be that difficult

[08:47] SubStack: for when you want some colors
[08:47] AAA_awright: No not SubStack
[08:47] Nuck: I'm sure you've made 3 libs for that exact purpose

[08:48] igl: Nuck: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules#graphics
[08:48] AAA_awright: SubStack: But how about this, I'm writing an IRC client and I want to pick colors that are as far apart as possible, weighted by how often each color is used. The two most talkative people, maybe, should be polar opposites.

[08:49] Nuck: igl: Oh right, I forgot that page existed LMAO
[08:49] AAA_awright: Also maybe that's a bad idea because I'm learning all the colors of everyone, I can see across the room and see this lilac color and it's either SubStack or Nuck

[09:25] AAA_awright: Is anyone using python2.7 to compile Node.js?
[09:25] AAA_awright: I'm getting some SyntaxError
[09:25] Nuck: I'm on 0.4.8
[09:25] Nuck: I haven't updated in a while
[09:25] Nuck: And I intend for it to stay that way until 0.6.x
[09:25] jetienne_: see tobi :)

[09:26] AAA_awright: I like the cutting edge, developing for it now means ready for the release in what seems like tomorrow each time a new one comes out
[09:27] jetienne_: about that 0.4.10 deb should be ready
[09:27] Nuck: AAA_awright: I swear, tj has coded half the code for my art site :P
[09:28] Nuck: Because I use so many of his awesome libs
[09:28] Nuck: Most prominently Express
[09:28] Nuck: But this will probably be another one
[09:28] AAA_awright: I don't have a particular person but I love all the really niche libs that people write
[09:29] AAA_awright: It's like O hey, an RDF integration library for Node.js, that only two people including me use
[09:29] Nuck: AAA_awright: I have an odd coding style which fits with a lot of tj's libs.
[09:29] jetienne_: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jerome-etienne/neoip && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nodejs <- install node 0.4.10 on ubuntu 11.04
[09:29] Nuck: Because his libs are very natural
[09:29] AAA_awright: Which ones, exactly?
[09:29] jetienne_: +documented+standalone
[09:30] jetienne_: +very little bugs
[09:30] Nuck: AAA_awright: Express, Connect, Caustic
[09:30] jetienne_: =good in my books
[09:30] AAA_awright: I use Jade, and... that's it
[09:30] Nuck: The man is one of the best coders we've got in the community.
[09:30] AAA_awright: And an RDF one, and a SPARQL library I wrote that in turn uses PEG at install-time
[09:30] Nuck: AAA_awright: You use some odd things

[09:33] Nuck: I got even more RAEG at dA today
[09:33] AAA_awright: They went read-only
[09:33] Nuck: Because I realized that their servers are horribly configured
[09:34] AAA_awright: And then logged you out after?
[09:34] Nuck: Not that
[09:34] AAA_awright: That too?
[09:34] AAA_awright: How so?
[09:34] Nuck: It's that I got stuck in this situation where all the resources were being loaded from an outdated URL
[09:34] Nuck: Which meant all resources 404'd
[09:34] Nuck: st.deviantart.net
[09:34] Nuck: Instead of .com

[09:34] AAA_awright: O.o

[09:35] pradeepto_bhatta has joined the channel
[09:35] AAA_awright: Well I mean a server-side cache
[09:36] AAA_awright: Also, Server:Apache

[09:36] muhqu has joined the channel
[09:36] Nuck: AAA_awright: It gave me more motivation to replace them

[09:36] Nuck: AAA_awrightReally?
[09:37] Nuck: Not surprising, I guess
[09:37] AAA_awright: That's what it advertises
[09:37] pickels has joined the channel
[09:37] Nuck: They have 150 servers
[09:37] Nuck: MySQL+PHP stack
[09:37] Nuck: With Apache on the main servers
[09:37] Nuck: Then they have shitty load balancers which disrupt long-term connections
[09:37] AAA_awright: Oh, but sh.da.net is Server:thttpd
[09:37] Nuck: when theyfail over
[09:38] Nuck: thttpd?

[09:38] AAA_awright: ... Why are you using three different platforms to serve content
[09:38] AAA_awright: Why
[09:38] callumacrae has joined the channel
[09:38] Nuck: AAA_awright: I'm gonna be using... 2.
[09:38] Nuck: Node and nginx
[09:38] AAA_awright: Node.js doesn't count
[09:38] Nuck: Why not?
[09:38] AAA_awright: That's generating the content not serving it?
[09:38] Nuck: Node serves the content
[09:39] AAA_awright: Especially if you have Nginx in front of it like I do
[09:39] Nuck: It's the API
[09:39] Nuck: AAA_awright: It'll be interfaced directly to an instance of Node, I assume
[09:39] PrgmrBill has joined the channel
[09:39] PrgmrBill has joined the channel

[09:39] AAA_awright: How do you load-balance requests?
[09:39] plov has joined the channel
[09:40] Nuck: AAA_awright: the plan is to use a load-balancer 
[09:40] Nuck: Also, how did you get that server info?
[09:40] AAA_awright: Nuck: HTTP headers
[09:40] jetienne_: 150server without load balancers ?
[09:40] jetienne_: ACTION is missing something
[09:40] AAA_awright: Network tab in Chrome, or Live HTTP Headers extension in Firefox
[09:40] Nuck: jetienne_: Huh?  dA has load balancers
[09:40] jhurliman has joined the channel
[09:40] Nuck: Just shitty ones
[09:41] Nuck: that cut ongoing connections

[09:46] tuhoojabotti: Hoho
[09:46] tuhoojabotti: Use irssi.
[09:46] Nuck: I still don't quite comprehend load balancers I think X3
[09:46] Nuck: Fuck irssi
[09:46] Nuck: It's a shitty client
[09:46] Nuck: I tried it

[09:46] Nuck: Thank god
[09:48] AAA_awright: I guess I'll work on it tomorrow
[09:48] Nuck: AAA_awrightWhat was it?
[09:48] Nuck: I was typing a response when mIRC crashed
[09:48] AAA_awright: if I get up in time for A State of Trance B-)
[09:48] Nuck: But I forget what
[09:48] AAA_awright: Oh uh
[09:48] AAA_awright: <AAA_awright> Like, 1e10 short, 100-byte documents?
[09:49] AAA_awright: I didn't say
[09:49] Nuck: oh yeah
[09:49] Nuck: It has lots of scalability
[09:49] Nuck: It's a scaly
[09:49] AAA_awright: Nuck: I'm wondering if I can store my entire IRC log in MongoDB, one object per line
[09:49] Nuck: It all depends on your fs
[09:49] Nuck: AAA_awright: Probably.
[09:49] AAA_awright: And I need to be able to get the pervious n records per channel quickly
[09:49] Nuck: AAA_awright: It'd be hell on your fs, but you could shard among servers too :P

[10:18] HelloWorld: how to execute jquery commands on a browser sent by nodejs?
[10:18] TheJH: HelloWorld, you have to put a little script in the browser-side script that eval()s messages from the server

[10:21] `3rdEden: wtfz
[10:21] TheJH: as long as he doesn't do it on the server, it's ok, right?
[10:21] `3rdEden: why don't you just send a message from the server like 'animate'
[10:21] `3rdEden: and check for that response the client
[10:21] `3rdEden: and do trigger the animation or function from that?
[10:22] TheJH: you'll either need to remake the whole jquery api to be async or to eval() code, right?
[10:22] SubStack: sending javascript source to the client to evaluate doesn't seem to be a very good separation of concerns
[10:22] `3rdEden: socket.send('pew'); io.on('message', function(msg){ if(msg == 'pew') $('*').explode() })
[10:22] TheJH: SubStack, might be true, but he asked for it
[10:23] jbpros has joined the channel
[10:23] TheJH: `3rdEden, that way, he has to put code on both the client and the server for everything he wants to trigegr from the server
[10:23] TheJH: *trigger
[10:24] SubStack: or the server can just do server stuff
[10:24] HelloWorld: eval sounds like the easy way, less js files to play with
[10:24] SubStack: and then the client can do client stuff
[10:24] SubStack: client stuff including doing dom manipulations in response to messages sent from the server
[10:24] TheJH: ok, HelloWorld, don't do what I said, listen to SubStack and `3rdEden, what they suggest will make your code cleaner

[14:32] seivan: also, does textmate have some form of JS syntax check everytime TJ saves on his screencast? What tm bundle is that?
[14:33] mscdex: seivan: you could always namespace it if you wanted, like req.data.user, req.data.foo, etc
[14:33] kofno has joined the channel
[14:33] seivan: mscdex: Fair enough, then it should be builtin in node and everyone should use the same namespace :
[14:33] mscdex: heh
[14:33] seivan: :)
[14:33] seivan: not in node*
[14:33] seivan: but in express at least

[14:47] tayy has joined the channel
[14:47] seivan: yet I still don't grasp how you can set a layout and have every other route render it's view inside that layout....
[14:47] papandreou has joined the channel
[14:47] seivan: I hate to say this because I know it might upset people here, but basically like rails (or django) you can have a global layout, where it will yield route specific views into it.
[14:48] seivan: thing like having to show the footer, header and head in the global layout you can define the rest of the content inside of it.
[14:48] seivan: Also do people recomend haml, jade or coffeecup?
[14:48] gf3: jade
[14:48] xtianw: jade is dope

[14:49] seivan: Digging connect-auth btw
[14:50] blueadept: yeah its handy, lessens the amount of cross browser code you need to write

[14:54] mendel_ has joined the channel
[14:54] seivan: xtianw: I'd like a global layout that would render the view for each route. In that layout I would specify the footer/header and head (with stylesheets and javascript)
[14:55] TheJH: what's the best library for couchdb?
[14:55] seivan: ehm
[14:55] xtianw: Yeah, by default that's layout.jade
[14:55] seivan: Just saying about nib.... that's old stuff for rails
[14:55] seivan: xtianw: Oh ok
[14:55] xtianw: And it passes a local named body

[16:01] chbrown: benmonty: neither `node app.js --stack_trace_limit 40` nor `node app.js --stack_trace_limit=40` give me more than the 8 steps it was giving me without the command line option.
[16:02] fille: chello
[16:02] EyePulp: devongovett: It keeps things very clean - and you can still install globally with the -g argument
[16:02] _sorensen_: i always install locally when i can
[16:02] _sorensen_: some things like docco are better globally
[16:02] mscdex: EyePulp: i was under the impression "-g" was not for regular packages, but packages that install command-line utilities?
[16:03] devongovett: local installs come with so many downsides. now I have to install packages again for every app. I have to have a node_modules folder in every app.
[16:03] boaz has joined the channel
[16:03] EyePulp: mscdex: hrm - I may have misunderstood it.
[16:03] mscdex: EyePulp: like coffeescript has that `coffee` command or whatever
[16:03] devongovett: and when I install things globally, node often doesn't even find the module
[16:04] isaacs: devongovett: use `npm link`.  or, install globally, and then `npm install --link`, which does the saem thign
[16:04] EyePulp: devongovett: how long have you been building apps, and how many projects do you juggle simultaneously?  Also, how often do you have to deploy to remote production servers?
[16:04] isaacs: devongovett: it's really not "so many downsides".  it's actually kind of nice, especially if you have a lot of apps, since now those apps can have conflicting deps without borking one another
[16:04] mikeal has joined the channel
[16:05] letsbefrank has joined the channel
[16:05] isaacs: devongovett: but i fully appreciate that it adds a step you didn't have before, which triggers the rage reflex.
[16:05] EyePulp: devongovett: all of which is to say, if you're doing a lot of project work, and it's something you're doing for a living, take our word for it that local installs are a much, *much* more attractive behavior.
[16:05] devongovett: isaacs: I realize that, but it also means I have to install it 100 times if I have 100 apps.
[16:05] chapel: devongovett: I didn't like it at first when I was faced with it, but I took too it after using it in production
[16:05] _sorensen_: you dont *have* to
[16:06] boaz has joined the channel
[16:06] letsbefrank: just jumped into the middle of a npm argument looks like
[16:06] isaacs: devongovett: it means that you have to init all 100 of your apps individually.  (you also have to do this for git, etc., and write 100 apps, etc.)
[16:06] letsbefrank: amiright?
[16:06] isaacs: letsbefrank: it's not a new one :)
[16:06] devongovett: EyePulp: I can see why it would be useful, but it's annoying
[16:06] chapel: :P
[16:06] letsbefrank: haha, indeed
[16:06] donald_cook has joined the channel
[16:06] isaacs: devongovett: if they really use the same deps (and i have a lot of projects myself with all the same deps) then use npm link.  it makes that specific annoyance much less annoying.
[16:07] raidfive has joined the channel
[16:07] _sorensen_: you could always just install everything globally first
[16:07] AaronMT has joined the channel
[16:07] isaacs: devongovett: cd some-dep; npm link ; cd ../some-app; npm link some-dep; cd ../other-app; npm link some-dep
[16:07] _sorensen_: and then locally when you start run into problems
[16:07] EyePulp: devongovett: get some more projects and dev time under your belt, do some deployments, and give it some time.  npm is like the pip of node.js
[16:07] chapel: devongovett: you just keep a package.json for your project and npm will read that and install everything for you
[16:07] isaacs: devongovett: or just `npm install --link` in each app
[16:07] _sorensen_: if you really want to fully appreciate why the new feature is a feature
[16:07] reid has joined the channel
[16:07] devongovett: EyePulp: I was deploying apps with npm 0.3 just as well.
[16:08] isaacs: for myself, i'm a fairly recent convert to the "everything local" camp.
[16:08] EyePulp: devongovett: *but* you had to pollute you global package collection with a copy of everything every app would need.
[16:08] ckknight has joined the channel
[16:09] isaacs: i only built the bundle command in 0.3 because people constantly asked for it, and then sort of begrudgingly accepted that local-only would allow a simpler folder structure that could in principle work on windows
[16:09] Fandekasp has joined the channel
[16:09] isaacs: (1.0 is not windows compatible.  0.x can never ever be windows compatible, no matter what you do.)
[16:09] ash__ has joined the channel
[16:09] EyePulp: and if you were running more than one node project in production on a single box, they were both depending on the same copy of a module - which is fine until you upgrade the module and it breaks one app and fixes the other.
[16:09] devongovett: isaacs: is there a way to tell npm to install a package globally when npm linking in package.json? E.g. forever or coffee-script as dependancies?
[16:09] benmonty: chbrown: maybe try printing out err.stack? i'm not really sure how to increase it if the CL arg didn't work
[16:10] isaacs: devongovett: `npm link coffee-script` installs it globally, and then links it locally
[16:10] isaacs: devongovett: so, what you can do is: npm install coffee-script -g; cd my-project; npm install --link; cd other/project; npm install --link
[16:10] mehlah has joined the channel
[16:11] isaacs: devongovett: or just `npm link coffee-script`
[16:11] ash__: hi guys, does anyone know of an expression library in javascript?
[16:11] ash__: i kind of what the end programmer to define rules, in the style of say mongodb query language
[16:11] synkro has joined the channel
[16:11] ash__: cos i dont want them to get access to the serverside runtime
[16:11] isaacs: devongovett: the nice thing about using install rather than "link" explicitly:  it can also install your other deps (and if they're not already global, it'll statically install them locally), and it respects the --save flag, which link doesn't (yet)
[16:11] EyePulp: isaacs: fwiw - I'm daily impressed with what npm does.
[16:13] letsbefrank: You know what I'm wondering, are there any robust content sanitation (whitelist based html/js filters) as npm modules yet?
[16:13] letsbefrank: looked through the modules section and some googling but haven't found one i'm happy with yet
[16:13] jensn has joined the channel
[16:13] isaacs: letsbefrank: yeah, something like that would be good.  i don't know of any.
[16:14] letsbefrank: cool, guess I have to make it
[16:14] isaacs: it'd be nice if yahoo could open source their yiv library
[16:14] isaacs: but they'll probably never do that.
[16:14] letsbefrank: working at Onswipe to turn online media into tablet ready format and we need it to be in a farily safe format
[16:14] devongovett: ok, isaacs: I'll give it another go. :_
[16:14] ash__: e.g. isaacs  any ideas for me :P
[16:14] letsbefrank: using node.js for all our fetching, purty fun not gonna lie
[16:15] donald_cook has joined the channel
[16:15] isaacs: letsbefrank: i could see how something like jsdom might be handy there.
[16:16] isaacs: letsbefrank: you could parse the content, and then strip out elements/attributes you don't like
[16:16] isaacs: ash__: no clue, sorry
[16:16] letsbefrank: for sure, I'll take a look
[16:17] ash__: e.g. i want the user to beable to return a boolean

[16:24] EyePulp: what's a good tutorial for writing up the package.json for my project (not to put in the npm library, but just for local deployment)?
[16:24] ash__: the shared object is a hash which can be used by parts of the workflow
[16:24] ekryski has joined the channel
[16:24] letsbefrank: ash__:ah! much clearer now
[16:24] ash__: e.g.
[16:24] ash__: a fileupload workflow would be
[16:25] ash__: start -> uploadFile -> detectMimeType -> eclusiveChoice(  if mimetype is image, route to image transformation etc
[16:25] ash__: maybe better i draw it
[16:25] ash__: :p
[16:25] letsbefrank: haha
[16:25] ash__: im implementing workflow patterns
[16:25] ash__: so sequence, parallel 
[16:26] letsbefrank: mhm got it
[16:26] ash__: but the one im doing now is called exclusive choice
[16:26] ash__: http://www.workflowpatterns.com/patterns/control/images/fig4.png
[16:26] ash__: can you see conditionals are node A?
[16:26] ash__: thats exactly what i would like to model
[16:27] letsbefrank: gotcha
[16:28] ash__: so BPM's in other languages such as java ruby
[16:28] ash__: you can do these JSP sort of expressions which evaluate conditions

[16:40] Intel_iX: JavaScript numbers wont hold them
[16:41] brez: SeanBannister: what im experencing is that expresso (the unit test framework) hangs when connecting
[16:41] brez: if i CTRL-C its runs tho
[16:41] brez: tests pass etc
[16:41] hunterloftis: Intel_iX: I believe GWT implements some 64bit long precision...
[16:41] SeanBannister: brez: ahhh k, guess its not related
[16:42] hunterloftis: Intel_iX: (although I'm pretty sure that all JS numbers are already 8 bytes long)
[16:43] Intel_iX: yes, but it's an 8 byte float
[16:43] Intel_iX: not 8 byte int
[16:43] Intel_iX: So for example
[16:43] Intel_iX: it can hold 2^64
[16:43] Intel_iX: but not
[16:43] Intel_iX: 2^64 - 1
[16:43] bnoordhuis: Intel_iX: 64 bits floats cannot hold 2^64

[17:26] Aikar: ryah: with nodes window support, is making node as a library in the plans for the near future as a DLL and static linked library? I got a project I use to work on id like to add JS support too, but would rather do node instead of plain V8... (Windows program)
[17:26] context: synkro: depends on the script.  if im reading a large ass file id rather read it in chunks and process as it goes, instead of attempting to read it all
[17:27] jeromegn has joined the channel
[17:27] jellosea: can i use fibers to wait on something instead of just sleep on time?

[17:28] bnoordhuis: don't know how well it currently works
[17:28] Aikar: ah
[17:29] Aikar: does it have like an export V8::Object node_get_global_obj() { } ?
[17:29] bnoordhuis: Aikar: i suspect you need to call node::Start(int, char**)

[17:31] jellosea: context: i want it to wait for a callback from a memcache call before it returns

[17:50] jerrysv: dandean: no, but the latest commit against vows.js offers jscoverage reporting, but you need to instrument yourself
[17:51] bnoordhuis: japj: what colour should a buffer label have?

[17:51] japj: what is the convention?
[17:51] Esteth: jerrysv: Thanks for the roundup :) I'll take a look at vows with zombie or tobi once I'm done examining Jasmine :)
[17:51] japj: while you are at it, make a lint label aswell ;)

[17:52] japj: what about console log?
[17:52] japj: ah wait, that might actually be something else
[17:52] japj: (the console thing)
[17:52] dandean: jerrysv: then I'd have to rework all of my test for vows, which would take way too long.
[17:53] japj: no, it was actually something in console.js
[17:53] jerrysv: dandean: have you tried instrumenting your files outside of expresso and seeing if it detects the instrumentation? and are you on 0.4 or 0.5 of node?
[17:53] japj: bnoordhuis: while you are at it, make a label for every .js file in lib/, cause that is about what is happening... or switch to a different labeling algorithm
[17:54] dandean: I'm on 0.4. I haven't tried that yet. I'm new to jscoverage, so I'm probably missing something here.
[17:54] jerrysv: dandean: unfortunately, other than spending a night in the jscoverage code inside expresso, i haven't had much experience with it -- i like vows
[17:55] jerrysv: dandean: it might be worth: jscoverage lib lib.covered
[17:55] jerrysv: dandean: then run your tests against lib.covered - see if expresso picks it up

[18:56] Kinbote: ACTION is getting annoyed with the debug loop of stop node, recompile coffeescript, restart node, which is ironically the same exact flow as the bad old days of web dev using CGI and perl
[18:56] fille: thats the same
[18:56] tjholowaychuk: joys of using compiled languages
[18:56] tjholowaychuk: Kinbote you could use the stylus middleware though and avoid that
[18:56] wink_: fille: i'd say yes, but i've already developed one for my company that i wont be able to release unfortunately :<
[18:56] tjholowaychuk: coffeescript you're screwed i think
[18:57] Prometheus: Kinbote: why not just have something watch coffeescript and recompile as it changes, then something else watch the node files?
[18:57] fille: wink i guess it will be hard. got some prolog experiance
[18:57] Kinbote: tjholowaychuk: i have used your middlware hook, so the stylus recompile works, but the coffeekup and coffeescript itself doesn't
[18:57] gf3: you are TOTALLY FUCKED when it comes to coffeescript
[18:57] gf3: FUCKED OUT OF YOUR MIND

[18:58] DrPizza: I just don't get the love for coffeescript

[18:59] DrPizza: That seems a horrible trade-off.
[18:59] tjholowaychuk: ambiguity ftw!
[18:59] tjholowaychuk: DrPizza ruby devs love ambiguity that's why

[20:02] jshaw: :), other question, i can't find a way to count assertions, i was about to roll my own, is there a way to do that already built in?

[20:19] tbranyen: javascirpt
[20:20] jellosea: i can't do that
[20:20] jellosea: because the callback is called with parameters that i need

[20:30] brolin_ has joined the channel
[20:30] isaacs: japj: have you seen this?  https://github.com/iriscouch/follow
[20:30] isaacs: japj: basically, you just point it at a couch, and it will make very damn sure that you get called for every change.
[20:31] jellosea: stagas: right, i got that part.. the problem is that in the callback I pass, i can't use a reference to the object i create because it hasn't been created yet..
[20:31] stagas: jellosea: new User(x, function() { this.getSimpleUserData() });
[20:31] jerrysv: jasonsmith++
[20:32] stagas: jellosea: and in User, var self = this; .. in memcached callback: callback.call(self)

[20:34] blakmatrix has joined the channel
[20:34] jellosea: why do i need the var self = this;
[20:34] stagas: jellosea: because you need to call the callback in the scope of User
[20:35] iFire has joined the channel
[20:35] stagas: jellosea: so we're storing it in 'self' to use it in callback.call(self); which is in another scope (the memcache callback scope)
[20:35] NHQ: Is there anything special I need to do for fs.mkdir('/public/newDir', 644) to work? I get no errors, but the directory is not being created
[20:36] jellosea: so what is "this" in new User(x, function() { this.getSimpleUserData() });
[20:36] isaacs: japj: https://gist.github.com/1098137
[20:36] jellosea: is it a reference to the object that is going to be created?
[20:36] stagas: jellosea: the first parameter of .call
[20:36] taf2_: NHQ... hrm are you waiting for it to finish?
[20:36] stagas: jellosea: is the scope
[20:36] stagas: jellosea: so 'this'
[20:36] Rubikzube has joined the channel
[20:36] stagas: jellosea: so the anon fn we call in new User will be called in the User scope (hopefully)
[20:36] stagas: :P
[20:37] NHQ: taf2_ I believe so. How long should it take? I also tried with mkdirSync
[20:37] NHQ: but i get an error with that
[20:37] jellosea: i dont get " in memcache callback, callback.cal(self))
[20:37] stagas: jellosea: what?

[20:38] jellosea: and in User, var self = this; .. in memcached callback: callback.call(self)

[20:39] stagas: jellosea: https://gist.github.com/e9e6f2dc2f7faf58316b doesn't this work?

[20:40] clyfe: how can I specify git dependencies with NPM?
[20:41] isaacs: clyfe: git dependenices?
[20:41] jellosea: and then we are calling this.getSimpleUserData().call(self); ???
[20:41] stagas: jellosea: .call is a function that calls the function with specified scope and parameters
[20:41] stagas: jellosea: there's also .apply that does the same thing with an array of arguments

[20:41] clyfe: isaacs: I'd like to use NPM like bundler does

[20:42] NHQ: @taf2 oh actually I am getting an error: ENOENT, No such file or directory \'/pubic/images/johnny\' 
[20:42] isaacs: clyfe: i don't know how bundler handles git.
[20:42] stagas: jellosea: so callback.call(self); calls callback with scope 'self' (in this case User) and no parameters
[20:42] stagas: jellosea: no it's really simple
[20:42] jellosea: right..
[20:42] isaacs: clyfe: but you cannot specify a git url as a dependency, no.

[20:43] jellosea: stagas: it makes the code so ugly though.. because i'm calling this.SimpleUserData() when i really want to call u.SimpleUserData()
[20:43] isaacs: clyfe: you can do the name:version in your package.json, and "bundleDependencies":["name"] as well, and then check it out as a submodule in node_modules/name
[20:43] isaacs: clyfe: look at npm's package.json and node_module folder: https://github.com/isaacs/npm
[20:43] stagas: jellosea: u make work

[20:44] japj_: strange dc'ed
[20:44] stagas: jellosea: but you don't always know the name of the variable, so 'this' is better
[20:44] japj_: isaacs: before I'm gonna setup all dependencies... should that be able to work on windows yet? (sry, I dc'ed so didnt get a response if there was any yet ;)
[20:44] stagas: jellosea: if you would be reusing the callback
[20:44] clyfe: isaacs: This has already been tought out and decided, not to suport dependencies from git ?
[20:45] isaacs: clyfe: yes.
[20:45] jellosea: btw its not working...
[20:45] clyfe: isaacs: Ok, thx
[20:45] jellosea: the outpit is just undefined
[20:45] isaacs: clyfe: when npm sees a .git folder, it just throws up its hands and refuses to do anything to it.
[20:45] isaacs: clyfe: it's too hazardous
[20:45] adambeynon has joined the channel
[20:45] isaacs: clyfe: if a package has a git repo url, though, you can easily add the submodule via:  npm submodule pkgname
[20:46] stagas: jellosea: oh this.simpleUserData where does that live?
[20:46] isaacs: clyfe: and you can update the submodule with `npm explore pkgname -- git pull origin master`
[20:46] stagas: jellosea: in memcached or User ?
[20:46] stagas: jellosea: if it's User then you should do self.SimpleUserData = ...
[20:47] stagas: jellosea: need to go out and dance, quickly :P
[20:47] clyfe: isaacs: The idea is I'd lime to use coffeekup 0.3beta that has not yet been released, but not make it a git submodule, it seems rather a hard stem for a light operation
[20:47] jellosea: stagas: its okay i'll figure it out
[20:47] jellosea: in User
[20:47] jellosea: ok
[20:47] stagas: jellosea: then try self.SimpleUserData = PHPIObject.....
[20:47] clyfe: *like
[20:47] stagas: and it'll work
[20:47] isaacs: clyfe: you can also install tarball urls if you really want.
[20:47] stagas: cya! :)
[20:47] jellosea: whats the difference between self and this

[21:49] Chani: hey guys
[21:49] NHQ: @isaacs https://gist.github.com/1098304
[21:49] Chani: I have a program that opens a file in append mode, with fs.open(file, 'a', ...
[21:49] Chani: works fine for me
[21:50] isaacs: NHQ: bug?    if (err || !stats.isDirectory())
[21:50] isaacs: don't you mean if (!err && !stats.isDirectory())?
[21:50] Chani: but on my TA's computer, it fails unless the file exists.
[21:50] Chani: ohh wai
[21:50] mikeal has joined the channel
[21:50] Chani: I bet it's the copy that fails. ut I protected that!
[21:50] Chani: still, *something* is working on my computer but not his

[21:51] kkaefer: spcshpopr8r: did you manage to get sqlite3 compiled?
[21:51] NHQ: @isaacs actually i did it that way b/c !stats.isDirectory() returns an error, but if you try to read stats on a dir that doesn't exists you get an error, so if (err) means the dir doesn't exists... a work around the problem i am experiencing
[21:51] Chani: var reader = fs.createReadStream(txn.path);
[21:51] nivoc has left the channel
[21:51] NHQ: @isaacs technically, as it stands, the || !stats.isDir() doesn't do anything
[21:51] Chani: ^^^ if the file passed does not exists, is it possible for that to throw an error before I've had a chance to set an error handler?
[21:51] isaacs: NHQ: so, if there IS an error, THEN you check stats.isDirectory()...
[21:52] isaacs: NHQ: that doesn't seem right.
[21:52] isaacs: NHQ: reduce to a smaller test case.
[21:52] TheJH: Chani, I don't think so
[21:52] softdrink: does anyone know of anything like FlashFirebug or Flashbug but for Chrome?
[21:52] NHQ: @isaacs if there is an error from trying to read fs.stat then I know it doesn't exists (in my mock scenario)
[21:52] NHQ: ok
[21:53] TheJH: softdrink, what does it do?
[21:53] softdrink: debugs flash
[21:53] softdrink: (dont hit me)
[21:53] softdrink: (we're moving away from it)

[21:53] Chani: because *something* is throwing an uncaught exception
[21:54] Chani: and I'm catching everything I can think of except that
[21:54] Chani: i used on('error' ...

[21:58] pandeiro has joined the channel
[21:58] Chani: damnit. that wasn't it
[21:59] AvianFlu: I mean, ENOENT means a file or dir doesn't exist
[21:59] fdenbow has joined the channel
[21:59] AvianFlu: weren't you trying to stat something?
[21:59] Chani: AvianFlu: yeah. a file I'm writing to.
[21:59] Chani: I did createReadStream, and then later open in append mode. those should be the only ways I touch the file
[21:59] AvianFlu: what write method do you use after createReadStream
[22:00] Chani: https://gist.github.com/1098338
[22:00] AvianFlu: is that a space in that dir name?
[22:00] Chani: AvianFlu: pipe
[22:00] Chani: and yes :/
[22:00] AvianFlu: well that's an unescaped space
[22:00] Chani: oh?
[22:00] AvianFlu: try it with a "\ "
[22:00] AvianFlu: yeah bash ain't down with that
[22:01] Chani: node uses bash??
[22:01] TheJH: Chani, it doesn't
[22:01] AvianFlu: node is run by bash, no?
[22:01] benjaminRRR has joined the channel
[22:01] AvianFlu: me saying 'bash' isn't right
[22:01] TheJH: AvianFlu, it doesn't use bash to access files, NO!
[22:01] Chani: AvianFlu: by that logic, everything is run by bash...
[22:01] NHQ: @isaacs excuse my naivette but is require("assert").ok( err || (stats && stats instanceof fs.Stats) ) = if statement?
[22:01] AvianFlu: the syscall that does the file I/O doesn't like the unescaped space maybe
[22:01] AvianFlu: forget I said bash
[22:02] TheJH: AvianFlu, syscalls only don't like nullbytes
[22:02] AvianFlu: Chani pasted: Error: ENOENT, No such file or directory '/home/mroth/Dropbox/School/TA/Cmpt 431/a2/cea5/tmp/test_file.txt'
[22:02] AvianFlu: that to me looks like a path with an unescaped space
[22:02] AvianFlu: I don't care who's trying to parse it, try a backslash in there
[22:02] Chani: I didn't realize node required them to be escaped.
[22:03] Chani: yeah, we're trying...
[22:03] TheJH: Chani, it doesn't
[22:03] AvianFlu: I'm telling you to try it because *I THINK* it's worth a shot
[22:03] jerrysv: shouldn't. does that tmp directory actually exist?
[22:03] AvianFlu: and it's an easy test
[22:04] TheJH: Chani, could you also gist your code?
[22:04] Chani: AvianFlu: that's not it
[22:04] Chani: no space, same error
[22:04] Chani: jerrysv: yep.
[22:04] AvianFlu: gist the code then, that error is too short to help
[22:04] Chani: once a file has been touched, it works
[22:04] Chani: the code is kinda long, but ok...
[22:06] Chani: http://chani.ca/temp/server.js
[22:06] jerrysv: chani: also, willing to try it in a different directory without dropbox? just to eliminate an external service
[22:06] Chani: there ya go. all teh code
[22:07] Chani: hmm. how could dropbox mess it up?
[22:07] hurreman has joined the channel
[22:07] jerrysv: chani: dropbox is mounted as a filesystem, which could be slow at actually creating the file
[22:07] Chani: huh.
[22:07] jerrysv: just a thought
[22:07] jerrysv: eliminate a variable
[22:07] Chani: but my code should be *catching* any errors...
[22:08] Chani: unless pipe throws directly instead of going through the readstream
[22:09] TheJH: Chani, seems like the source of the pipe call doesn't have an error handler
[22:09] digiwano has joined the channel
[22:10] TheJH: no, it has one...

[22:10] Chani: maybe he's using hte buggy version that throws extra errors!

[23:33] Sam_K: I found the same question asked on Stack Overflow and the answer given was that the server had "keep alive" connections going that keeping it running, but that doesn't seem to make sense because it still does the same thing even when no requests have been made to the server at all

[23:38] TheJH: Sam_K, the browser and node will hold their connection open for five minutes or so in case they need it again
[23:38] TheJH: Sam_K, did you try closing the browser?
[23:38] Sam_K: yes I did
[23:38] Sam_K: also I tested with making no requests at all
[23:38] Sam_K: just closing server right after start up
[23:38] TheJH: Sam_K, could you gist the exact code you're using?
[23:39] Sam_K: gist?

[23:51] Corren: what do you all use to compute specific metrics about your apps?
[23:51] Sam_K: Here is the gist
[23:51] Sam_K: https://gist.github.com/1098527
[23:52] Sam_K: Run it twice in two seperate consoles, The second instance will contact the first instance and ask it to end
[23:52] Sam_K: on Windows the first instance will crash after calling server.close()
[23:53] TooTallNate: Sam_K: the try/catch around your http request isn't doing anything
[23:53] Sam_K: well.. I did say I was new around here :)
[23:54] Corren: has anyone ever written to google analytics from node.js ?
[23:54] TooTallNate: Sam_K: you're already listening for the 'error' event, that's all that's needed for the http.Client
[23:54] Sam_K: In that case I was chucking try/catches in all over the place to try to catch an error that was giving me a non-informative stack trace
[23:55] TooTallNate: Sam_K: you'll learn that try/catch in node is close to worthless
[23:55] TooTallNate: errors are more often the first argument of any async 'callback'
[23:55] TheJH: cradle question: how do I create a document with a specific id or, in case it already exists, replace it?
