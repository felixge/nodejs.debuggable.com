[00:00] sechrist: So, first startup to rip my spotify collection's mp3 files, replace them automagically with higher quality versions of what it can, and keep it synchronized amongst google music, amazon, and apple's thing will make me really happy
[00:00] vidi: c79b5c3cffe5c7e210c2676d177a18e8d4f80115

[00:00] DrMcKay: mind if I copy a bit of our IRC log as a README? I don't feel creative
[00:00] Nuck: LOL
[00:01] CoverSlide: go ahead
[00:01] insin: ACTION hopes it consists entirely of this "DrMcKay: I wouldn't care if you called it PNIS protocol, as long as it was awesome."
[00:01] insin: then "introducing PNIS"
[00:01] Nuck: LOL

[00:01] DrMcKay: insin: I will include that :D

[00:03] bassui: does anyone know if jade has an equivalent of != partial('view','arr') when using jade.renderFile? I want to use 'partial' instead of 'include'.
[00:04] tjholowaychuk: bassui you'd have to write your own, partial() is express
[00:04] CoverSlide: bassui: http://tjholowaychuk.com/post/7590787973/jade-mixins-includes
[00:05] tjholowaychuk: but yeah mixins are kinda more or less the same as partials, with the exception that they are inlined in your compile function
[00:05] tjholowaychuk: so if you have hundreds, your function will be very large
[00:05] insin: does jade do inheritance, or are there plans to do so?
[00:06] tjholowaychuk: not right now nope
[00:06] Nuck: LOL
[00:06] insin: stupid Django, can't get me enough of that inheritance :/
[00:06] Nuck: Somebody fork CIA-bot?
[00:06] sechrist: cia-bot ftw
[00:06] tjholowaychuk: i like some of the inheritance ideas from django's stuff
[00:06] tjholowaychuk: but
[00:06] tjholowaychuk: it's really ugly
[00:07] othiym23 has joined the channel
[00:07] tjholowaychuk: if we can get around that
[00:07] tjholowaychuk: im for it
[00:07] DrMcKay: Nuck: by "fork", did you mean: rewrite in node.js :D ?
[00:07] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: yeah, the code to get inheritance working is a bit barfy.
[00:07] tjholowaychuk: i dont mean the code to get it working
[00:07] sechrist: tjholowaychuk: does express have anything similar to a decorator? other than helper functions? or is that meant to do the same thing?
[00:07] tjholowaychuk: just the template
[00:07] Nuck: DrMcKay: That works too :P
[00:08] Nuck: Just call on the github APIs for their issues, then use an IRC protocol module
[00:08] sechrist: I guess I was looking through the docs for some syntax sugar like @blahblah but eh
[00:08] Nuck: I'm sure it's actually rather easy lol
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: the "sub"-template ends up looking really sparse with a shit ton of { block }{ endblock } things
[00:08] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: ah. yeah. you kind of get used to looking at that, though.
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: which is mostly just gross because of the syntax
[00:08] insin: yeah, child templates have to be entirely blocks
[00:09] chrisdickinson: insin: well, you can put things outside of the blocks, but it'll get ignored.
[00:09] insin: I implemented it in my own lib recently, was an interesting exercise

[01:37] davidbanham: Is there a canonical way to implement a forgotten password feature? I'm thinking generate some kind of hash, shove that in a database of some kind, when someone clicks a forgotten password link check if the hash is both valid and sufficiently fresh. Sound about right?

[01:37] Emmanuel`: davidbanham: pretty muich
[01:37] EyePulp has joined the channel
[01:38] davidbanham: Emmanuel`: I'm thinking I should probably have some kind of rate limiting on the hash check so that someone can't just brute force the correct hash.

[01:40] Emmanuel`: care*
[01:41] davidbanham: Emmanuel`: Yeah I suppose so. Just seems strange that I'd spend a whole bunch of time making my application awesomefast which would then make a brute forcer's job easier! Yeah I'll just do a stupid long hash and a 1 hour time limit or something.
[01:42] Emmanuel`: in your case, a brute force attack would be more of a DOS

[09:23] Glenjamin: is ~indexOf common enough to be considered readable?
[09:23] chjj: considered readable?
[09:23] chjj: yeah, id say its very common
[09:24] Glenjamin: well unless you know that ~(-1) == 0, it's a bit opaque
[09:24] chjj: if people dont know what it is, thats their problem
[09:24] Nexxy: I FOR ONE HAD NO CLUE
[09:24] Glenjamin: which is my point
[09:24] chjj: your problem
[09:24] Nexxy: that's just what the devil would say
[09:24] Glenjamin: == -1 is 4 more characters and more readable perhaps
[09:25] chjj: i think using ~ is actually faster in v8 for some reason
[09:25] chjj: dont ask me how i know
[09:25] cjroebuck has joined the channel
[09:25] Glenjamin: heh, microoptimisation
[09:25] Glenjamin: bitwise operations on negative numbers seems a bit odd
[09:25] chjj: i went insane when optimizing my selector engine
[09:25] chjj: i benchmarked every line of code
[09:26] chjj: and tried ~indexOf vs indexOf === -1
[09:26] chjj: i was expecting === -1 to actually be faster too
[09:26] Fabryz has joined the channel
[09:26] hekkwan_ has joined the channel
[09:26] chjj: or !== -1
[09:26] chjj: i mean
[09:27] Glenjamin: === probably wraps in an object and then compares
[09:27] Glenjamin: maybe
[09:27] Glenjamin: i dunno
[09:27] chjj: v8 should be able to optimize it just as well, v8 is really good about optimizing "constants"
[09:27] Glenjamin: mm
[09:28] chjj: especially things like regexes, its actually faster to do `/regex/.test(str)` than it is to do `var r = /regex/; r.test(str);`
[09:28] chjj: even if its multiple times, in a loop or something
[09:28] chjj: v8 can recognize that its essentially being used as a constant and it doesnt have to instantiate a real object with mutable properties and whatnot
[09:28] Glenjamin: surely if its a hot loop it'll get optimised better anyway
[09:28] cclever has joined the channel
[09:29] chjj: most people define regexes elsewhere and hold them in a var
[09:29] chjj: thats not the best thing to do in v8

[09:30] chjj: i think even shitty js engines like IE are pretty good about it

However I've just noticed fs.watchFile, can this do what I want (and how taxing will it be CPU wise since the program will be running 24/7 but only ocassionally get fed new files to act upon)

[11:41] Ratty_: looks like couchdb but it's returned by npm
[11:41] DrMcKay: festiz: maybe only collaborators can add labels?
[11:42] festiz: maybe so
[11:42] japj: Kingdutch: watchFile is implemented differently on the different platforms, so cpu usage depends on what platform you're running on

[12:41] Glenjamin: does the API support conditional GET?
[12:41] butu5: anybody can create issue? without autho... I ll check..
[12:41] DrMcKay: butu5: no, we can only fetch issues

[12:42] DrMcKay: Glenjamin: it should do it's job :)
[12:43] DrMcKay: butu5: no, we only want them to be reported here, on IRC
[12:43] butu5: ok cool.. I will start work on it... today I stumble upon one good library node-github
[12:43] butu5: tot to play with that as well... 
[12:44] DrMcKay: I think I will need to write something to call modules with some timeout

[12:45] butu5: DrMcKay: hey I am having hard time configuring ngircd on mac... ubuntu it went great!
[12:46] butu5: ohh u said u r running fedora right 
[12:46] DrMcKay: butu5: try running it with -n parameter
[12:46] butu5: I did
[12:46] DrMcKay: it failed?
[12:47] butu5: irc server able to start.. I can able to login through irssi also and posting msg all works
[12:47] butu5: but while connecting from the node-irc it keeps on retrying
[12:47] butu5: giving user name not registered error .. then keep on retrying with diffrent user names
[12:48] butu5: and fainally throwing error.. max count reached or something like taht... don't know
[12:48] butu5: ubuntu same setup same code base working gr8
[12:48] DrMcKay: server reports some errors or something?
[12:48] bradleymeck has joined the channel
[12:49] butu5: nope
[12:49] butu5: now I am not infront of mac.. so can't remember the exact error now
[12:49] butu5: https://github.com/butu5/node-irc4mobile/blob/master/index.coffee
[12:49] Glenjamin: user name not registered sounds like the server giving you an error
[12:49] thomblake has joined the channel
[12:50] butu5: this piece of code working really gr8 on ubuntu.. same code cloned on mac.. throwing error
[12:51] DrMcKay: butu5: have you tried running it as a daemon?
[12:51] thomblake has left the channel
[12:51] butu5: yes I did.. with ngircd -n so that I can see all the debug msg
[12:51] butu5: also gave debug:true on client
[12:52] butu5: now not remembering the error on top of my head.. if you were online in couple of more hr I will probably tell u the error

[12:54] DrMcKay: butu5: I'm writing some code for intervals

[12:54] butu5: ok
[12:54] butu5: okay
[12:55] butu5: Glenjamin: I have setup ngircd server on ubuntu.. and when trying to connect from my local system not able to join the channel

[12:56] SamuraiJack_ has joined the channel
[12:56] butu5: yes
[12:57] Glenjamin: is it not connecting to the server, or not being denied by the server?

[13:02] AvianFlu: okay, you need to add a 'motd' listener to check for the motd
[13:03] AvianFlu: you should also run debug: true until you know what's going on
[13:03] AvianFlu: you get a lot of useful output from that
[13:04] butu5: oh okay thanks!! (I need to spend more time on ircd setup then I initially tot ).. will spent some time on this

[13:06] DrMcKay: no, there's a better way I think
[13:07] AvianFlu: DrMcKay: what are you trying to do?
[13:07] DrMcKay: write something to let modules do some actions on intervals
[13:08] AvianFlu: like a cron?
[13:08] DrMcKay: I've already done that
[13:08] AvianFlu: or like setInterval type intervals
[13:08] DrMcKay: setInterval
[13:08] DrMcKay: I was just thinking how to tell a module which irc channel is he on
[13:08] AvianFlu: how's it different from the global we already have?
[13:08] DrMcKay: and I figured out I don't have to :)

[13:09] DrMcKay: butu5: not yet, testing
[13:09] Marak: DrMcKay: just more problems
[13:09] Marak: using the event loop and nextTick() and new Date().getTime()
[13:09] Marak: way more efficient
[13:09] fangel has joined the channel
[13:09] Marak: not going to leak at all
[13:09] Marak: way more precise
[13:09] Marak: timers suck
[13:09] Marak: lol
[13:10] Marak: use them only for UI 
[13:10] Glenjamin: really?
[13:10] Marak: thats my current thoughts
[13:10] bnoordhuis has joined the channel
[13:10] Marak: and ive done some fairly high precision timer stuff with JSONloops
[13:10] Marak: and tmpvar 
[13:10] Marak: hes pretty smart i think
[13:10] Glenjamin: in that case, implementing setInterval in JS using that approach would be better then?
[13:10] AvianFlu: definitely
[13:11] luke` has joined the channel
[13:11] AvianFlu: because you're not pretending that JS always knows the length of a second
[13:11] DrMcKay: that's FIXLATER for now ;)
[13:11] Marak: i have no idea how v8 handles timers
[13:12] DrMcKay: butu5: pushed
[13:13] butu5: ok checking..
[13:13] DrMcKay: brb, I will write some docs or an example
[13:14] AvianFlu: I trust checking the system time, I don't trust that one thread of JS isn't off by a few ms every tick
[13:14] AvianFlu: that's how I'd look at that

[14:01] JAAulde: Glenjamin: thank you. Is there a more dynamic way in case someone has node installed somewhere (and, I assume, would cause npm node_modules to be somewhere else)
[14:02] Glenjamin: its the repsonsibility of whoever installed npm to make sure that the lib dir is on the node path imo
[14:02] matyr has joined the channel
[14:02] JAAulde: Glenjamin: ok, makes sense.  I appreciate it!  That export should go in my .bash_profile, I assume? (and anything else which sets env vars for a process?)
[14:03] soapyillusions: bnoordhuis https://gist.github.com/1156847 went ahead and added that

[15:09] Sembiance: eazyigz: I use node-mongodb-native, but I'm currently at work, not at home where the code is.  A cursory glance at your pastie looks ok. Are you sure the {id} query is the right one?  Have you tried a simple test app that just inserts, gets, prints, updates, gets, prints?

[15:11] dexter_e has joined the channel
[15:12] eazyigz: Sembiance: there seems to be a bug, because when I pass a random number as _id, it still echoes that it updated the record!

[15:14] eazyigz: Glenjamin: then what are my options here?

[17:19] DrMcKay: so, huh. a originating server generates a token, valid only for one user and for some time. each server on the way contacts him and asks him for token validity. receiving server does the same.
[17:19] DrMcKay: that *may* work
[17:19] CoverSlide: sweer
[17:19] butu5 has joined the channel
[17:21] DrMcKay: remp motto should be "it *may* work"

[17:44] snowinferno|2: Is there more documentation on what events are valid on a net.Socket object?
[17:44] micheil: snowinferno|2: check either the code or docs

[17:44] eazyigz: newbie_: can you run grep -w 3000 /etc/services
[17:45] micheil: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.10/api/net.html#net.Socket
[17:45] context: uhh what does grep have to do with turning a firewall off
[17:45] context: newbie_: its not on by default
[17:45] micheil: snowinferno|2: which in turn inherits events documented at: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.10/api/streams.html
[17:45] dgathright has joined the channel
[17:45] snowinferno|2: I checked the docs, it doesn't seem to list an event suitable for what I need
[17:45] eazyigz: context: if you wanted to find out what was up with port 3000, you might use this command:
[17:45] newbie_: eazyigz: that does not return anything
[17:45] micheil: snowinferno|2: what event do you need?
[17:46] context: eazyigz: yes but he asked about the firewall. not what port 3000 is. 
[17:46] micheil: ryah: do you have any tips on writing network data parsers?
[17:46] micheil: (I'm thinking of the http_parser style parsers)
[17:46] eazyigz: context: he asked about enabling node remotely on port 3000
[17:46] snowinferno|2: micheil: I'm trying to remove a socket from a list of sockets when that socket gets closed, I tried close and end but at that point the socket doesn't seem to have a valid fd
[17:47] context: oh.
[17:47] micheil: snowinferno|2: okay, well, the close and end ones are what you want
[17:47] eazyigz: newbie_: can you run that command for port 8080 (out of curiosity)

[17:48] eazyigz: newbie_: type sestatus
[17:49] newbie_: eazyigz: command not found

[17:49] newbie_: DrMcKay: cat: /selinux/enforce: No such file or directory
[17:49] context: selinux sucks. why would you run it
[17:50] DrMcKay: oh, then you're not running selinux

[17:56] zackattack has joined the channel
[17:56] context: sounds like just another way to think your safer. 'turn it on and forget it'
[17:57] micheil: snowinferno|2: Are you trying to list what the remote ip & port is, or local ip and port?
[17:58] snowinferno|2: micheil: I'm trying to get a telnet based chat working that keeps track of the connected sockets so I can send output to appropriate people. I was looking for the remote ip to prevent multiple connections from the same location
[17:58] DrMcKay: context: I haven't ever thought about it in this way. Well chosen file privileges sometimes have better impact on security than any application/kernel patch
[17:58] micheil: okay, the easier thing to do is assign a unique id per client

[18:01] snowinferno|2: hmm that's something I hadn't yet considered. I wanted to get a basic running list of connected sockets and evolve it later into much more but i might as well start out with an object that has the socket as a property and keep a list of the objects instead of a list of sockets...

[18:10] topaxi has joined the channel
[18:10] context: selinux is WAY to complicated to simply 'turn on' and your more safe.
[18:10] Aikar: tnlogy: set log level to 0 or require('socket.io/lib/logger').prototype.log = function(){};
[18:11] DrMcKay: context: sure it's a keyword. it's called "safety by default", or something
[18:11] DrMcKay: most people end up disabling it.
[18:11] context: cjackson: or modify neither?
[18:11] Aikar: i def didnt like selinux randomly killing my processes
[18:11] tnlogy: how do you set the log level? (just started using node.js)..
[18:11] tnlogy: and thanks!
[18:12] cjackson: context: hmm?
[18:12] Aikar: tnlogy: var io = socketio.listen(app); io.set('log level', 0);        
[18:12] tnlogy: thanks!
[18:12] DrMcKay: I got really pissed of when it started killing chrome processes
[18:12] context: drmckay: but its not. its generalized bs settings, to make you feel safe
[18:12] DrMcKay: just because my profile was located on a mounted NTFS volume
[18:13] Aikar: selinux seems to really only be marginally useful if you have a shared system with people you dont trust (which is a horrible idea to begin with!)
[18:13] context: http://www.jwz.org/images/greatimage.jpg

I see there's this:  http://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#loading_from_node_modules_Folders   which isn't what i want. i want it to always look at ~/local  so i can run scripts from anywhere in my source. 
[18:15] snowinferno|2: micheil: that approach worked like a charm, thanks! I can see I'm going to have to shift my thinking a bit
[18:15] isaacs: StanlySoManly: keep reading that doc.
[18:15] Aikar: StanlySoManly: that ability was removed
[18:15] isaacs: StanlySoManly: there's a NODE_PATH environment variable
[18:15] isaacs: Aikar: require.paths was removed.
[18:15] isaacs: so you can't *change* it at run-time
[18:15] DrMcKay: we need to make some banner, I think
[18:15] isaacs: but you can set it at the start of your script
[18:15] Aikar: oh right node path
[18:16] bbigras__ has joined the channel
[18:16] micheil: isaacs: hmm, do you think node's dtrace probes are hackable to add them into any project?

[18:16] StanlySoManly: isaacs: thanks! looks like i have a problem with not reading the *whole* doc before asking a question. i'll look into that. :) 
[18:17] isaacs: :)
[18:17] isaacs: micheil: not sure
[18:17] context: cjackson: if you dont know what net_legacy or net_uv are you probably dont need to edit them
[18:17] micheil: currently they are all done with these magic looking fuctions
[18:17] micheil: *functions
[18:18] cjackson: context: i'm trying to make it so that setEncoding can unset encodings. to do so i can either hack it from the callsite, or do it properly and submit a patch for everyone else

[18:21] micheil: although, there may be a option for discussion with isaacs, ryah, or bnoordhuis on that
[18:21] micheil: as node doesn't have a "binary" type any more
[18:21] bengrue has joined the channel
[18:21] isaacs: you should really only use setEncoding if you're very sure that it will always be strings.

[18:22] bbigras__: Is it normal that if I modify a Date() with setHours(), when I print it with console.log() the date object still outputs the datetime before the change? Sample code https://gist.github.com/1157556
[18:22] isaacs: since you also have to be sure that you'll never get chunks that split unicode byte pairs
[18:22] micheil: ACTION is actually removing the setEncoding call in node-websocket-server in the next release.
[18:22] isaacs: the safer option is to collect all the chunks, put them in one buffer, and then toString() it
[18:23] micheil: isaacs: who's that guy at joyent that did all the dtrace stuff in node?
[18:23] matyr_ has joined the channel
[18:23] DrMcKay: isaacs++ for mentioning it
[18:23] micheil: isaacs: I'd love to be able to add in dtrace instrumenting to node-websocket-server
[18:23] isaacs: micheil: mailing list :)
[18:23] cjackson: isaacs: so the use case here is the CHUNKING extension to SMTP, where we get a lot of ascii protocol jonx, but then at some point we want to read N bytes of binary data off the stream
[18:23] soapyillusions_ has joined the channel
[18:23] isaacs: micheil: bryan cantrill did the initial probes in node, I believe.  he also invented dtrace :)
[18:23] zackattack has joined the channel
[18:24] micheil: isaacs: right, okay
[18:24] isaacs: cjackson: ok.  you're gonna have to chop your own buffers, i'm afraid
[18:24] micheil: cjackson: in which case you shouldn't use setEncoding
[18:24] isaacs: cjackson: don't use setEncoding
[18:24] micheil: you should be doing a stream parser that will reinterpret buffers based on a given state
[18:24] visnup: isaacs: and everyone I know feels slow and not smart when they talk to him
[18:25] micheil: visnup: I've heard that of brian
[18:25] cjackson: isaacs: micheil err, so the protocol guarantees that i get a clean cutover point, and i was hoping on sparing myself the extra work
[18:25] micheil: *bryan
[18:25] visnup: ...which is a compliment to bryan
[18:25] micheil: I can't believe I always spell his name wrong, considering my middle name is his first name.
[18:26] visnup: micheil: I always spell your name wrong too :)
[18:26] micheil: cjackson: not recommend to try and short cut there
[18:26] isaacs: cjackson: you can do buffer.slice(n, m).toString("ascii") to get the ascii bigs out
[18:26] isaacs: *bits
[18:26] micheil: visnup: is that saying something? :P
[18:27] cjackson: isaacs: so, most of the stream is ascii. it'd be neat if i could do the reverse
[18:27] visnup: micheil: luckily I'm normally chatting with you and autocomplete covers me
[18:27] cjackson: micheil: yeah that's probably what i'll end up doing. thanks :)

[19:11] Cover|Lunch: it sure does
[19:11] alindeman: It's console based, but has colors, yes
[19:11] TheJH: then it might be good :)
[19:12] kepheus: tjholowaychuk which module did you use for your testing?
[19:12] alindeman: Run it in GNU screen or tmux on a server and you have your very own irccloud ;)
[19:12] tjholowaychuk: kepheus tried a few, but they both used jsdom
[19:12] tjholowaychuk: i think the html parser was crapping out on the site's bad html

[20:16] tjholowaychuk: japj yup
[20:16] tjholowaychuk: not sure if it's much smaller now or not

[20:48] CoverSlide: the os usually has an internal dns cache
[20:48] TheJH: isaacs, :)

[20:48] apipkin: isaacs: no output, goes back to prompt
[20:48] isaacs: CoverSlide: there's an open issue to use the system's gethostaddr
[20:48] isaacs: apipkin: yeah
[20:49] isaacs: apipkin: but now `npm -v` should report the same thing as /usr/local/bin/npm -v
[20:49] isaacs: oh!  wait, no
[20:49] isaacs: apipkin: i'm dumb, just noticed the broken path
[20:49] isaacs: apipkin: you have node instaled in /usr/bin/node, not /usr/local/bin/node
[20:49] markdaws: issacs: just to clarify, every new connection will then cause a DNS lookup?
[20:49] isaacs: markdaws: no
[20:49] isaacs: markdaws: but the first one may
[20:49] markdaws: k
[20:50] isaacs: markdaws: just that it doesn't use the os cache necessarily

[22:01] WhyNo: Howdy guys. So I am having a problem. Basically we have two events that fire, onComplete and onError. onComplete can fire, but then onError can fire if obviously there is an error. The problem is that basically we have code we want to execute a single time in both the callbacks. So, I thought maybe of setting a timeout in the onComplete callback and waiting a bit too see if the onError will fire. Total hack. Is there a better way.

[22:07] mjr_: WhyNo: thing.once("error", function (err) {})

[22:07] CoverSlide: Epeli: if(require.main == module)
[22:08] Epeli: CoverSlide:  thanks!
[22:08] WhyNo: So, but both will fire, so onComplete fires, and then onError fires. I want onError to take precendence.

[22:12] zastaph: hmm https://github.com/dodo/node-raphael says its not compatible with my node v0.5.3-pre "Required: 0.4.x" Are node versions not generally backward compatible?
[22:12] CoverSlide: zastaph: 0.[odd-number].x are unstable builds
[22:12] CoverSlide: and should not be used for production, only for testing
[22:12] mjr_: What I usually do is something like this:  function do_something(args, callback) { var r = make_req(function () { if (callback) { callback(); callback = null; }); r.on("error", function (err) { if (callback) { callback(err); callback = null; }}}
[22:13] ecin_ has joined the channel
[22:13] idefine has joined the channel
[22:13] zastaph: CoverSlide, well i'm just developing for now.. but when NPM gives me this error, is it because some packages are hardcoded to only work with a certain version?
[22:13] mjr_: Which is fine as long as your callbacks can't also trigger an error event on the same stack
[22:13] CoverSlide: unstable builds are usually there to introduce new api changes, which will most likely break scripts written on previous versions
[22:14] CoverSlide: zastaph: it's a safety feature, so you don't install it by accident before they had a chance to test it out
[22:14] zastaph: well I just followed https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation
[22:14] CoverSlide: on that version

[22:34] aho: :>
[22:34] WhyNo: @mjr_ That fragment you posted on gist, will that really, execute the callback in onError instead of the callback onComplete? Seems like it will execute onComplete set callback = null; I need too, execute the callback in onError, not onComplete if there was an error.

[22:35] DrMcKay: *creationix
[22:35] aho: *tabcompletion
[22:35] aho: :>
[22:35] mjr_: WhyNo: it'll run both handlers, but it won't call the callback if the callback has already been called, because it gets set to null.
[22:36] mjr_: WhyNo: and because both functions close over the same callback var, if one sets it to null, then the other will see it as null
[22:37] WhyNo: Sure, but see, in my case onComplete gets called, then fires the callback, but then an error happens, and fires again, though the callback already been called. Not what I need. I need onError to call the callback. Basically, onComplete has to WAIT and see if there is going to be an error, before executing the callback.
[22:37] DrMcKay: creationix: but they can also become some literacy critics or something
[22:37] DrMcKay: creationix: and at that point, it's kinda easier to terminate child process than a baby :>
[22:37] fdenbow has joined the channel
[22:37] mjr_: WhyNo: my thing does that.  It makes it so the callback can only be called once, no matter who calls it.
[22:38] mjr_: Multiple errors will still only call the callback once

[23:46] tjholowaychuk: i was building a live code heatmap thing
[23:46] tjholowaychuk: with socketio
[23:46] chrisdickinson: ooo.
[23:46] tjholowaychuk: so while your app is running you can see the nodes light up
[23:46] tjholowaychuk: but
[23:46] tjholowaychuk: realized i dont have the time haha
[23:46] chrisdickinson: yeah, i was thinking about abstracting the code out so that you could hook onto object prototypes during runtime to profile them
[23:47] chrisdickinson: ideally you'd be able to hook onto modules, but i'm not sure if that's possible.
[23:47] tjholowaychuk: basically i think all we need is js in -> js out, instrumented with $cov[file][line]++ etc

[23:49] tjholowaychuk: js -> js, and a bit of analysis would be nice
[23:49] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: less opinionated as in less tied to `require`?
[23:50] tjholowaychuk: just pass it the raw obj cov and output return useful stuff as an obj
[23:50] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[23:50] tjholowaychuk: not tied to anything
[23:50] jtrudeau has joined the channel
[23:50] chrisdickinson: i'd say bunker would be the best bet in that respect.
[23:50] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[23:51] chrisdickinson: runforcover is just a specific application of bunker to the node environment
[23:51] tjholowaychuk: bunker doesnt do anything though
[23:51] tjholowaychuk: that's why everyone keeps rewriting this cov stuff
[23:51] tjholowaychuk: we just need js -> js with lines -> run it however you want -> pass $cov to stats() -> return cool stuff
[23:52] chrisdickinson: the hard bit is that you need to be able to do js -> js -> (run in the same context as current context) -> stats
[23:52] chrisdickinson: and bunker's approach is that it'll create the context for you. runforcover just creates a point-for-point clone of the expected node context.
[23:53] tjholowaychuk: it shouldnt care about any of that
[23:53] tjholowaychuk: where it runs and how the js is loaded
[23:53] tjholowaychuk: is a non-goal for something like that IMO
[23:53] chrisdickinson: to get code to run correctly, it kind of has to emulate the environment.
[23:53] tjholowaychuk: let the test frameworks do fs.readFile / vm blah blah if they want
[23:54] tjholowaychuk: just like jscov, it doesnt care how you run the js
[23:54] tjholowaychuk: it just gives you some instrumented js
[23:54] tjholowaychuk: the way it should be, minus the C
[23:55] chrisdickinson: bunker does that though. it takes JS, and gives you back decorated JS. then you can run it however you like (provided you pass in the appropriate context -- the bunker context vars)
[23:56] tjholowaychuk: yeah but it doesnt produce code coverage related stuff
[23:57] tjholowaychuk: nor analysis
[23:57] tjholowaychuk: it's just a glorified visitor
[23:57] tjholowaychuk: which does basically nothing
[23:57] chrisdickinson: it gives you the pieces you need to put together the coverage data, though
[23:57] tjholowaychuk: sure
[23:57] tjholowaychuk: im just saying no one has written something like jscov yet
[23:57] chrisdickinson: and the missing pieces -- the code for finding that -- is really really tiny.
[23:57] tjholowaychuk: yeah i know
[23:58] tjholowaychuk: it would be trivial to implement on top of uglify alone
[23:58] tjholowaychuk: but no one has done it
[23:58] Sazpaimon__ has joined the channel
[23:58] couchquid has joined the channel
[23:59] charleyd has joined the channel
[23:59] chrisdickinson: so it should go (js in) -> js function taking the appropriate context?
[23:59] chrisdickinson: (in this case, whatever you're wrapping statements with)
