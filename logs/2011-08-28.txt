[00:07] infynyxx has joined the channel
[00:07] Nuck: That's index manipulation
[00:07] Nuck: Not indexOf
[00:07] pksunkara: yeah
[00:08] Nuck: indexOf, for those of you who forget, is a search
[00:08] bnoordhuis has joined the channel
[00:08] pksunkara: so you can indexOf using index manipulation
[00:08] Nuck: That seems pretty inefficient
[00:09] pksunkara: yes, but we should do with what we have
[00:09] Nuck: SubStack: You don't happen to have a module that does this?

[00:16] Nuck: sid3k: Require() just returns the value of a file's mdoule.exports

[00:17] tomshaw has left the channel
[00:17] sid3k: how can I get module object of a module that I call?
[00:17] Nuck: sid3k: AFAIK, there's no way
[00:17] geetarista: level editor won't save/work, having issues talking to node, having issues setting up either socket.io or faye
[00:17] pksunkara: I think you can
[00:17] sorensen: uh, how can you use impact.js?
[00:18] sorensen: its not open source or free
[00:18] sid3k: so, what is the easiest way to find out the dependency tree of a module ?
[00:18] geetarista: it's on the services page...
[00:18] sorensen: oooo
[00:18] Nuck: sorensen: They gave licenses to NKO teams
[00:18] geetarista: yeah
[00:18] sorensen: interdasting
[00:18] sorensen: sorry, didn't know
[00:18] geetarista: no worries
[00:18] pksunkara: sid3k: let's say you do var fs = require('fs') in module1.js
[00:18] sid3k: yeah
[00:18] pksunkara: and do exports.fs = fs;
[00:18] sid3k: yep
[00:18] pksunkara: now in index.js
[00:18] geetarista: just wanted to see if there was another framework we could just spend a little time playing with and see if it helps

[00:57] jheusala: It took us something like a 6 hours to figure that out!

[01:39] Nuck: For some reason, the condition on line 5 never returns true, even when it should be true
[01:40] Nuck: Is this some odd property of Buffers?
[01:40] Nuck: v8: Buffer

[01:43] seebees: a[0] === b[0] && a[1] === b[1] && ...
[01:43] seebees: there may be a better way.  looking.
[01:43] Nuck: Seems highly inefficient.  Maybe toString them?
[01:43] Nuck: utf8 should retain the data just fine, right?
[01:43] seebees: hum, you could toString(utf-8)...
[01:43] Nuck: wait
[01:43] Nuck: Just toString('base64')
[01:44] seebees: nice
[01:44] seebees: but it might be faster to do something like if (a[i] == b[0] && a.toString === b.toString())
[01:45] facorreia has joined the channel
[01:46] Nuck: utf8 is prolly faster
[01:46] Nuck: Since it doesn't require base conversion

[01:54] slip has joined the channel
[01:54] Nuck: So I search from 0 to haystack.length - needle.length, checking to see if it matches
[01:54] bassui has left the channel
[01:54] Nuck: It functions like a "sliding door" over the haystack Buffer, using slice to grab each chunk and compare
[01:55] Nuck: If the first three characters don't match, it won't compare any more, since it's obviously not it, thanks to lazy evaluation.
[01:56] tonymilne: Yo peeeps,
[01:56] aho: did you check if needle.length is <= haystack.length? :>
[01:56] Nuck: aho: I will add that optimization right now :D

[01:56] aho: it's more of a sanity check
[01:57] trentm has joined the channel

[02:04] slip has joined the channel

[02:05] bnoordhuis: but not exactly in lg(n) :)
[02:05] firebus: can i run http and https servers in the same node process?

[02:05] bnoordhuis: Nuck: sure, open an issue and i'll add it when i have time to kill

[02:08] Nuck: I just look for the last hyphen and see if it's the start of a divider

[07:18] jamesw: on load that sets the session id I passed in the html
[07:18] jamesw: the way yours is set up
[07:19] jamesw: you'd have to do #{locals.foo}
[07:19] jamesw: unless jade automatically reads "locals" and converts it
[07:19] jamesw: not sure

[09:30] ako: right. on the server you then need to throw that b64 crap away... then decode the base64 data into a buffer or whatever canvas node can use
[09:30] japj: slaskis: that is where the C++ part resides as far as I can tell
[09:30] ako: b64 *header* crap
[09:30] slaskis: japj: ooh, i missed that part
[09:30] slaskis: that sucks, so i'll just have to use eventemitter2 instead then

[09:31] japj: slaskis: https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/ChangeLog#L121 the c++ side was removed in 0.5.2

This is going to basically involve nearly all of EU splitting from US - so it's going to be noisy. Sorry for the inconvenience, and I'll send another message when we're done.
[11:15] TheJH: Nuck, -Martinp23- [Global Notice] Hi everyone - that's the end of the ride. Everything that needs to be is now re-hubbed, so thanks for your patience and for using freenode, and sorry for the noise. Ask in #freenode with questions. :)

[11:32] industrial: However if you are writing an update function and dont know all the key names you are changing and it might also have nested keys, then you need to write a function to convert e.g. the JSON into a correct $set update object {a: 'b', 'c.d.e': 'f', 'c.d.g': 'h'}

[12:15] Klevre: "The solution is to remove the -L/usr/lib and -L/usr/local/lib lines from the final build step."
[12:15] japj: so it probably is not something in cygwin
[12:15] Klevre: lines from where? confused by that solution
[12:17] japj: Klevre: it could be that something broke during the a recent change
[12:17] Klevre: hmm
[12:17] Klevre: have you check that blog post?
[12:18] japj: Klevre: that page might be slightly out of date, since they reworked the buildsystem in 0.5.x aswell
[12:18] Klevre: it seems the guy got it to build
[12:18] Klevre: oh
[12:18] japj: Klevre: those instructions probably work for 0.4.x
[12:18] japj: Klevre: if there is no specific reason for you to use 0.5 then it might be better to switch to 0.4.x or use the pre-build windows binary for 0.5.x
[12:19] japj: Klevre: unless you want to work on node itself ofcourse

[18:35] miels: Croms: does that have something to do with it? Do I need to reboot?
[18:35] Croms: miels: What version of Ubuntu are you running?
[18:35] sylvinus: gerad: can we use both no.de instance & linode instances for the duration of the voting ?
[18:36] gerad: yes
[18:36] gerad: but make sure that you only have the require('nko') deployed to one of them

[18:38] Croms: miels: I don't really have any knowledge of Ubuntu prior to 10.04. Did you 'sudo apt-get install upstart'?
[18:38] miels: Croms: yea but upstart was already installed. I suppose I could try uninstalling and installing it

[21:23] necrodearia: Following "How to use" section at https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io#readme if I execute `node socket.io.js` where socket.io.js contains http://privatepaste.com/bb8a56d4b0 and then want to load it (what is it?, socket.io.js file again? the running node.js process?  something else?) from client side, how do I reference it?  Referencing the file socket.io.js in an html file handle by apache2 still shows "require is not defined"
