[00:32] johnnywengluu: says "segmentation fault"
[00:32] tonymilne: It needs compiling against your version of node.
[00:32] johnnywengluu: ah
[00:32] tonymilne: (and OS, etc)
[00:33] johnnywengluu: why actually
[00:33] tonymilne: It also has a dep on the c based LibXML2.
[00:33] johnnywengluu: okay
[00:33] tonymilne: The version you downloaded is pre-compiled against node 0.2.2 stable.
[00:34] tonymilne: (which is probs way older than what you're using!)
[00:34] tonymilne: go here: https://github.com/ajaxorg/o3
[00:34] johnnywengluu: i guess they use a C lib just to not having to code a new XML parsing algorithm?
[00:34] tonymilne: No, it's way faster, too.

[01:22] fakewaffle: ChrisPartridge: thanks! i have a beforeSave, and afterSave working with models too
[01:22] tonymilne: well, migrations are a way to declare your database schema, and migrate up / down through them, in a version controllable way.
[01:22] eee_c has joined the channel
[01:22] tonymilne: fixtures are a way to define data that can be loaded.
[01:22] tonymilne: so they were shells, and you'd write cake migrate all
[01:22] fakewaffle: ahh, yeah, i tried a bit with migrations
[01:22] tonymilne: and cake fixtures
[01:22] tonymilne: and you'd have the latest database and data.

[02:27] brainproxy: amid_hasan: one of the most important things is to 1) solidify your knowledge of the JS language; Flanagan's book and javascriptgarden.info are helpful there; 2) read through the node.js API a couple of times

[02:28] spcshpopr8r: pointers?
[02:28] brainproxy: re: 2) not only read through it, but write some test scripts to experiment w/ what's defined in the node.js API to make sure you understand what those things do

[04:02] dhasenan: TheDahv, just an observation about nerd communication habits. Asking questions on the wrong channel can get somewhat angry responses which will often include information on how to find the right one.
[04:02] TheDahv: Um, if it helps, code so far is at http://github.com/TheDahv/whatsfordinner
[04:02] dhasenan: But asking if you can ask a question, or if it's appropriate, gets you nothing most of the time.

[04:03] TheDahv: dhasenan: I got it. I'm moving on with the question part now. Shall we?
[04:03] dhasenan: ^_^
[04:03] TheDahv: So, in a given request, we're dealing with a document that contains embedded documents
[04:03] TheDahv: It's a meal planning app
[04:03] TheDahv: where a given 'plan' contains an embedded document array of 'meals'
[04:03] pplante: what about axing a question?
[04:03] TheDahv: i'm getting there
[04:04] TheDahv: meals have an embedded document array of ingredients
[04:04] TheDahv: i'd like to update the ingredients on a request by 1) clearing the ingredients on each meal 2) updating the ingredients on each meal with what is in the request params
[04:05] mundanity has joined the channel
[04:05] TheDahv: I'm finding that no amount of schema.save() is getting mongoose to cooperate
[04:05] TheDahv: I was initially concerned that I was just not programming with async in mind
[04:05] TheDahv: I pulled in the async library from npm, but that hasn't helped so far
[04:06] TheDahv: So, the question is: is there an existing 'good idea' strategy for dealing with embedded documents within embedded documents when updating?
[04:09] tonymilne: Hey TheDahv, there actually might be a bug with saving embedded documents with Mongoose at the moment. Are you using Mongoose?
[04:09] dhasenan: Your usage looks pretty much like the canonical way of doing it.
[04:10] tonymilne: scratch that. :) you said you were... I'm looking at what I did in my code.
[04:10] TheDahv: Yeah, you know I've been looking around and finding all kinds of issues in the google groups about embedded documents bugs in mongoose
[04:10] tonymilne: Until someone fixes Mongoose, try dropping into the MongoDB collection.
[04:10] tonymilne: E.g.
[04:11] tonymilne: collection.update({ _id: model._id }, updates, function(err, results) { 
[04:11] tonymilne: // snip...  
[04:11] tonymilne: });
[04:11] TheDahv: I have access to the mongo api from mongoose?
[04:11] tonymilne: Ya, you can see it on their website.
[04:11] tonymilne: or read their code.
[04:12] TheDahv: huh, I hadn't thought of that
[04:12] tonymilne: Er, it was meant to be:
[04:12] tonymilne: model.collection.update(
[04:12] MikhX has joined the channel
[04:12] tonymilne: you can use all of the MongoDB query / update code from teh MongoDB website.
[04:12] tonymilne: gimme a holla if you dont follow what im saying.
[04:13] TheDahv: Where model is the (usually capitalized) Schema object I've created with Model = new Schema(...) ?
[04:13] TheDahv: tonymilne: I'm getting more and more familiar with mongodb proper
[04:13] TheDahv: I just didn't know if the mongoose abstraction would prevent me from writing mongo queries
[04:14] tonymilne: Mongoose is good, just has some parts that are a bit spiky :)

[04:16] brainproxy: VPS is a no-brainer you don't mind admin'ing your own server
[04:17] brainproxy: *if you..
[04:17] TheDahv: Yeah, I don't think I would mind
[04:17] TheDahv: I tend to explore options that involve FREE first :)
[04:17] brainproxy: hehe
[04:17] TheDahv: But that's because I'm a bum. If I set up my own server, I likely wouldn't be here
[04:17] TheDahv: Well, that's not entirely true
[04:18] TheDahv: But I do like the idea of exploring the community aspect of node.js

[04:27] tonymilne: It's a mish-mash of some stuff to give you an idea.
[04:27] tonymilne: The static and methods are really really useful!
[04:29] sebbie has joined the channel
[04:29] tonymilne: Note: there are a couple of things wrong with that, after re-reading it... but you get the drift.
[04:30] TheDahv: tonymilne: reading...
[04:31] tonymilne: so, in your case: because i know that the mongoose embedded object stuff doesnt update well.
[04:31] tonymilne: I'd create a strong function for updating a meal.
[04:31] sivy has joined the channel
[04:32] TheDahv: hmm, interesting
[04:32] sechrist has joined the channel
[04:32] tonymilne: So, you could find a meal in your controller (by mealId)... if it doesnt exist return an error.
[04:32] TheDahv: in the latter case, i'd want to create a new meal
[04:32] tonymilne: With that meal, you have a function updateIngredients on the meal model (a method NOT static)
[04:33] TheDahv: newly created plan doesn't necessarily have a full array (ie, 7 items) 
[04:33] tonymilne: sure. well to create new instances of model objects its easy.
[04:33] TheDahv: upon creation
[04:33] TheDahv: yeah
[04:33] tonymilne: var mealModel = mongoose('meal');
[04:33] TheDahv: so, you're kind of saying I shouls write all these methods and attach them to the Plan schema and work from there
[04:33] TheDahv: ?
[04:33] tonymilne: var meal = new mealModel({ data });
[04:34] TheDahv: Yeah, I had that set up at one point, but the mongoose docs seemed to state that I wouldn't actually be saving those schemas into models and working with those models
[04:34] mscdex: meal.on('omnomnom', function() { self.full(); });
[04:34] mscdex: :-D
[04:34] TheDahv: As i'm sure you are aware, setting methods on schemas that are embedded documents don't work out so well
[04:34] TheDahv: mscdex: omg you solved it. project finished :)
[04:35] tonymilne: Yeah, so sometimes you might add the methods to the top level schema and i guess have them operate on the embedded docs. 
[04:35] TheDahv: So like, trying to set meal.method('clearIngredients', function () { this.doStuff(); }); fails
[04:35] TheDahv: Yeah. I didn't learn that embedded documents aren't treated as first class objects until like...yesterday
[04:35] tonymilne: yeah, see thats where i think you might be trying to add a method to the wrong thing.
[04:36] tonymilne: you add methods and statics to schemas that become models.
[04:36] TheDahv: Yeah, it feels a little weird to do everything from the top, but I'm new to this document database stuff so I'm willing to bend my mind
[04:37] tonymilne: Its also hard because i dont really know exactly what you're doing.
[04:37] tonymilne: LOL. ;)
[04:37] TheDahv: you and me both ;)'
[04:37] tonymilne: but ya, definately be wary that trying to update embedded documents was failing for me
[04:37] tonymilne: and also incrementing a number as well from memory.
[04:39] TheDahv: I take some solace in that this is new stuff
[04:39] TheDahv: I'm ok with minor defeat for now. It may be a battle, but there is still a war to be wno

[07:47] mobius-: morning everyone. :) I've been playing recently with cluster, and I am trying to use long-polling to pass down events on listeners. However, each listener binds on a seperate worker and I need to share the events between the workers. Is this possible? (without resorting to redis or mongo)
[07:50] mobius-: noone?

[08:03] JakeyChan: how many modules I should now when start develop web with node.js ?? what are they ?
[08:06] neaf: JakeyChan, express, mognoose, some template engine
[08:06] JakeyChan: neaf: what about socket.io. connect etc.
[08:07] neaf: JakeyChan, express will probably lead you to connect (it's built on top of that), socket.io for 'love' communication, don't know if you need it.
[08:07] neaf: JakeyChan: But that's exactly my stack for my current project
[08:08] JakeyChan: neaf: thanks !

[08:08] JakeyChan: neaf: card game ?
[08:08] JakeyChan: neaf: can i play now ?

[08:39] tdegrunt has joined the channel
[08:42] daglees has joined the channel
[08:45] bzinger has joined the channel
[08:45] chjj: slickplaid: it will be the same object
[08:45] chjj: slickplaid: im not exactly sure what youre asking, but it sounds like youd want to expose a function from the required module, and pass it an argument, e.g....
[08:46] chjj: module.exports = function(data) {};
[08:46] chjj: require('mymodule')(data)
[08:47] slickplaid: Basically I want to be able to use a required module (like redis) in another script that is require()'d later in the same file... if that makes sense
[08:47] slickplaid: let me gist it
[08:47] bb_ has joined the channel
[08:48] chjj: slickplaid, theres a number of ways you could do that
[08:48] chjj: one way would be to instantiate your redis object in a separate file entirely and require it by both

[08:51] petrjanda: Hello guys, pls does anyone know how to deal with "(libev) kevent: Bad file descriptor" error on OSX, after node.js process fork()? 
[08:51] slickplaid: I suppose require()'ing it in both files will work fine but it kinda bugs me to see that happen.
[08:52] slickplaid: I need to be able to use it in both and they don't need to be the same object so I guess that'd work.
[08:52] slickplaid: Just that all the configuration would have to be repeated and that seems kinda repetitive.
[08:52] jonaslund has joined the channel
[08:53] adnam: slickplaid: if you require twice the module is not loaded into memory twice afaik
[08:53] adnam: but if you want to add settings to it, make your own module and require that instead
[08:54] slickplaid: Not really worried about the memory usage. It's the duplication of the configuration for that require()'d module that is the issue. 
[08:54] slickplaid: Yeah, that might be the best option. Just pass the object back to the main script
[08:55] slickplaid: Somewhat annoying to have the direction of information only working one way though unless I'm missing something.
[08:55] adnam: hmm, what do you mean?
[08:55] slickplaid: But, I suppose there is a very good reason for it. :D
[08:56] slickplaid: module.exports is one way, only to the calling script... unless there's something big I'm missing to do the reverse.
[08:56] adnam: and no, modules are not loaded twice, just confirmed, makes sense because of potential side effects
[08:57] stonebranch has joined the channel
[08:57] slickplaid: I suppose I could module.exports = function(data){ return newObjectWithData; } like chjj had said earlier.
[08:57] adnam: slickplaid: file a and b needs to use your settings in file c, make c export itself, and a and b both require them
[08:57] jbpros has joined the channel
[08:58] adnam: that works
[08:58] slickplaid: I suppose I could abuse the event system to .on('updateScript', data) and use that to work back and forth in the event loop :D

[09:03] slickplaid: Interesting... thanks neaf :)
[09:04] harsu has joined the channel
[09:04] neaf: slickplaid, so when you build your modules to be fairy independent and want to share some data I think this is the way to go. 
[09:05] torgeir has joined the channel
[09:06] Rodtusker has joined the channel
[09:06] blup has joined the channel
[09:06] slickplaid: Yeah, I'm completely splitting up the require() for each module and configuring them there and passing the configuration and configured object back to the main script to be used. Works best in my head that way, I think.
[09:06] neaf: slickplaid, I've got my socket connection manager, which stores my connections, ties them to a game objects and does some other things, i need the connections in my SocketMessageHandler, and GameManager so I require the ConnectionManager in those 2 
[09:07] jbpros has joined the channel
[09:08] slickplaid: Nice. Yeah I think I'll split it up and require() them separately for user registration/login/passhash/etc and then just pass all the objects back to the main script so they can be used and/or edited and remade if needed.
[09:08] slickplaid: module.exports = { mail: configuredNodemailer, db: configuredRedisObject, redis: rawRedisObject, etc: 
[09:09] __doc__ has joined the channel
[09:10] neaf: slickplaid, hmm, if you want your main script to be 'requireable'. 
[09:10] neaf: my main.js 'splits' to ExpressApp and Socket, and then I require db separately in those two and so on.
[09:12] neaf: This way I can require and run every module outside my 'main' as those never refer to main object, always require what they need.

[13:40] mape: rpj8: make a recursive loop and put some time inbetween
[13:41] mape: rpj8: and your callback should do callback(error, payload)
[13:41] rpj8: mape: that sounds really dirty

[13:43] rpj8: mape: adds to the stack, no?

[13:59] lukstr: blah
[13:59] lukstr: davidban_: isn't that the latest?
[14:00] mape: And the general idea is node is that if you have a callback it is async, and since async == issues with capturing errors there needs to be an error passed
[14:00] lukstr: davidban_: also you could try making a tmp dir in your home directory but I don't believe that's the issue
[14:00] davidban_: lukstr: Not sure what you mean by osm, sorry. That is the latest version of Winston, but the trouble is that it isn't doing the full build.
[14:00] lukstr: osm was a typo :P
[14:01] davidban_: lukstr: That's what I did in the top half of the latest pastebin, didn't help :(
[14:01] mape: lukstr: btw, if I were you, and you already had an array with users I'd just use an object instead and use if(users[username]){return true;} faster using the hash tables then looping through an array accessing objects

[14:03] lukstr: if I was that concerned about speed, and if my user list was that big, otherwise what rpj8 had was fine

[14:07] mape: could still loop through it doing Object.keys(users).forEach(function(userkey){var user = users[userkey];}) That would be slower but yeah..
[14:07] rpj8: mape: I'm all for using the simpler method that's still adhearing to non-blocking

[15:09] TheJH: would you consider it to be mean to put node in a long chain of commands in the shell? "cat dewiki-20110601-pages-articles.xml.bz2  | bunzip2 | coffee printwords.coffee | sort -u | bzip2 > wordlist.bz2"

[15:25] jetienne has joined the channel
[15:25] gf3: it's already in the $PATH, many software packages expect things to be there, and it's relatively safe
[15:25] Corren: ok, so we have a root "app" express module that does all the configures, and then (where app is express.createServer) does lots of app.post/put/get/etc 
[15:25] Corren: what I'm unsure of is how to set a response header for every request

[15:40] drudge: er http://expressjs.com/
[15:40] gsmcwhirter: easternbloc, I am confused about what you are trying to do. That being said, I am far from an expert, so it may be a valid question that I just don't know the context for.
[15:40] gf3: lukstr: sure, and if you're setting up a server, it's a totally different story as well
[15:40] mscdex: yeah you could use expressjs and if you need sql orm there's modules like sequelize
[15:40] Poetro has joined the channel
[15:40] easternbloc: gsmcwhirter: I have a piece of code that requires say, several other modules
[15:40] |RicharD|: umh but is better use a webframework as expressjs or better php/ror ecc... ?
[15:41] gf3: lukstr: for me, as a developer, I just want to get to the coding
[15:41] |RicharD|: (i want reply based on working experience)
[15:41] easternbloc: but I don't want the actual functionality behind those modules to happen
[15:41] easternbloc: so I need to mock them
[15:41] easternbloc: but, in my tests, I have blah.test.js which imports the file I wanna test
[15:41] easternbloc: problem is, by default all those modules are auto loaded
[15:42] mscdex: also on a side note, fakewaffle is working on a framework that is essentially cakephp for javascript called piejs
[15:42] easternbloc: so I have no opportunity to mock them
[15:42] mscdex: :)
[15:42] gsmcwhirter: easternbloc, ah. that is indeed something I have never run into, sorry =(
[15:42] easternbloc: I sorta don't get why people arn't having that issue though
[15:42] lukstr: gf3: so do I, but on most systems regardless of if they are a server or not that's a bad idea :P and your case aside, it would hardly buy you anything anyways
[15:42] easternbloc: I mean to fully test a module you have to mock it's dependencies right?

[16:26] isaacs: mape: yeah, don't do link with -g
[16:26] isaacs: mape: did you do `npm config set global true` or something?
[16:26] amerine has joined the channel
[16:26] mape: > npm link
[16:26] mape: npm ERR! Error: link should never be --global.
[16:26] mape: > npm -version
[16:26] mape: 1.0.1rc7
[16:26] isaacs: mape: the reason is that link does this kinda back-and-forth thing between local and global.  (also, wow, update.)
[16:27] pquerna: 3rd-Eden around?
[16:27] mape: isaacs: I'm even older on some systems because of the -g issue :P But I'll do the root system curl update and try
[16:27] isaacs: mape: yeah, we're on 1.0.8 now :)
[16:27] CoverSlide: isaacs: do you keep stats on how many times a package gets installed? like directly instead of as a dependency?
[16:27] isaacs: CoverSlide: nope.
[16:28] mape: isaacs: btw using npm to update npm seems to fail most of the time, npm ERR! Could not get uid/gid npm ERR! Error: Cannot find module '/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/bin/npm-get-uid-gid.js'
[16:28] isaacs: mape: yeah, known bug.  haven't fixed it yet.
[16:28] mape: had some people I got into nodejs have some issues with it
[16:28] mape: ok
[16:28] isaacs: mape: i need to work out the timing of when it does that, so it's before it deletes itself.

[16:29] ddombrow has joined the channel
[16:29] lukstr: isaacs: thanks
[16:29] isaacs: mape: the issue is that you *have* to do that as a child proc, since it does a setuid
[16:29] mape: isaacs: ie node core issue?
[16:29] lukstr: isaacs, mape : I upgraded from 1.0.6 to 1.0.8 a few hours ago and it indeed removed itself with that error. It was funny
[16:30] edgarallanpoe has joined the channel
[16:30] mape: isaacs: btw what was the core reason to move to -g? Had some people I introduced to node that questioned if that was a good move. Was it more or less "good to have deps coupled to projects" ?
[16:31] avalanche123 has joined the channel
[16:33] CoverSlide: good for versioning as well
[16:34] tiagoa has joined the channel
[16:34] CoverSlide: if a later revision of a package changes its api, older packages wont get affected
[16:34] mape: jup, guess it is more an issue of ease of use
[16:35] Dinosaurus has joined the channel
[16:35] mape: and old docs saying one thing when npm does another
[16:35] lukstr: mape: modules aren't really meant to be system level dependencies, but project-level, so encouraging you to keep them tight to your project pretty much reduces conflicts to zero
[16:35] isaacs: mape: sharing deps within a project is great.
[16:35] Dinosaurus has left the channel
[16:35] CoverSlide: im guilty of doing npm -g install for every new package I find
[16:35] isaacs: mape: but there was a lot of situations I and others ran into where isolation was a good thing
[16:36] dgathright has joined the channel
[16:36] isaacs: mape: which old docs?
[16:36] mape: lukstr: well it wasen't like that back in the days
[16:36] isaacs: mape: the paradigm use case: i do npm install redis.  i do require("redis"). it all works.  then, one day, it doesn't work.  i want to debug it.  where is "redis"?
[16:36] isaacs: like, the actual code, not a symlink.
[16:36] isaacs: it's a pain
[16:37] mape: isaacs: well mostly modules on github
[16:37] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[16:37] isaacs: mape: i mean, where is the actual code being loaded by my program?
[16:37] isaacs: i want to edit it
[16:37] isaacs: add logging, etc.
[16:37] CoverSlide: node scripts tend to be pretty tiny
[16:37] isaacs: in its quest to be full featured, npm 0.2 made this unnecessarily hard.
[16:37] CoverSlide: biggest one in global right now is dnode at 9M
[16:38] CoverSlide: npm is 1.3
[16:38] mape: isaacs: well earlier it was just a matter of finding the latest version symlinked, but yeah, I get the idea
[16:38] isaacs: so we cut away the features that were in the way.  that was 0.3.  then we moved things local, so that it was easier to answer this question.
[16:38] arnau_ has joined the channel
[16:39] arnau_: Hi, is anybody there?
[16:39] isaacs: done in two big stages so that it was not quite as traumatic.  0.3 broke packages and authors hated it.  1.0 changed install semantics and (some) users hated it.  but we're in a good place, now, i think.
[16:39] CoverSlide: nobod here but us bots
[16:39] drudge: i definitely prefer the local installation method
[16:39] mape: That is the strange thing about this channel
[16:40] CoverSlide: even the bots have typos

[16:40] arnau_: I'm trying to compile the latest version of nodejs on debian squeeze and I get the followin error when I do make -f Makefile.cmake package /root/node/src/node.h:25:16: error: uv.h: No such file or directory
[16:40] mape: scary almost
[16:40] addisonj: hrm, so I am not smart today, trying to think of how to populate a jade template with the currently set option in a select without client side js, any novel solutions?
[16:40] beriberikix_ has joined the channel
[16:40] isaacs: arnau_: does it work when you don't use cmake
[16:40] arnau_: anybody know how to fix this?
[16:40] isaacs: ?
[16:40] arnau_: I'm trying to create a .deb package
[16:40] mape: arnau_: debian isn't having the best of times with node lately
[16:40] lukstr: isaacs: though to be fair there is something be desired from a system where you automatically benefit from library upgrades (i.e. you can choose between "libX2" and "libX2.0" and "libX2.3"
[16:41] isaacs: lukstr: you can still do that.
[16:41] isaacs: lukstr: `npm update` still works
[16:41] mape: Seems there is no support from joyent on debian lately
[16:41] isaacs: mape: lately?
[16:41] isaacs: mape: was there ever?
[16:41] mape: isaacs: Hehe perhaps not, just that it broke some versions ago
[16:41] addisonj: isaacs, imho, npm is in a wonderful location, thanks for the hard work
[16:41] lukstr: isaacs: I mean more like the way you do dynamic linking in linux
[16:41] isaacs: mape: we're a solaris shop, dude.
[16:41] addisonj: isaacs++
[16:41] v8bot:  addisonj has given a beer to isaacs. isaacs now has 22 beers.
[16:41] CoverSlide: node only supports OSX and Solaris
[16:41] isaacs: thanks, addisonj 
[16:42] isaacs: lukstr: imo, the way you do dynamic linking in linux is a problematic solution to this problem.
[16:42] mape: isaacs: Yep, thought this whole open source magic fixed them issues
[16:42] arnau_: I tried  make -f Makefile.cmake
[16:42] arnau_: and also the same error
[16:42] arnau_: what do you suggest?
[16:42] isaacs: arnau_: does this work?  `./configure && make`?
[16:43] arnau_: yes
[16:43] isaacs: arnau_: i'm trying to see if it's an issue with the code, or with cmake
[16:43] isaacs: ok, then it seems like there's a bug in Makefile.cmake
[16:43] arnau_: but that does not create a deb file
[16:43] isaacs: right
[16:43] lukstr: isaacs: I guess it is difficult given the nature of node modules
[16:43] arnau_: and I'd need it to install on production servers
[16:43] isaacs: but the cmake file doesn't set the include path properly, it seem
[16:43] isaacs: s
[16:43] arnau_: where there is no option to compile
[16:43] mape: isaacs: Think you still end up with ssl2 issues if building on debian. There are issues(and patches) for this on github, not merged
[16:43] broofa has joined the channel
[16:44] zeade has joined the channel
[16:44] arnau_: let me try again with ./configure && make
[16:44] drudge: addisonj: boolean values will only output in jade if they evaluate to true
[16:45] arnau_: compiling.... it will take a bit on my VM
[16:45] arnau_: 'build' finished successfully (46.136s)
[16:45] Bradleymeck has joined the channel
[16:45] arnau_: so I guess, it's something related with cmake, what do you think?
[16:45] mape: isaacs: And is that the offical take on things? To have things work one should use solaris? Or them new forks for it?
[16:46] isaacs: mape: nono
[16:46] isaacs: mape: node should work on solaris, linux, bsd, and darwin
[16:46] isaacs: and, occasionally, when the stars align, cygwin
[16:46] isaacs: and, soon, windows
[16:46] arnau_: comparing deps/uv with deps/c-ares
[16:46] arnau_: I see there is no CMakeLists.txt in deps/uv
[16:47] arnau_: could be this the problem?
[16:47] isaacs: but as far as the cmake build script, or cross-compiling, or making .deb packages, those aren't super high priority issues
[16:47] isaacs: arnau_: i know zero about the cmake script
[16:47] isaacs: arnau_: ask the list, maybe?
[16:47] arnau_: me too
[16:47] addisonj: drudge, hrm, well that is helpful, but does that mean I need to have an inline js function for each option? still struggling to make in not have lots of cruft
[16:47] isaacs: arnau_: i guarantee that the problem is in the cmake system, though
[16:47] mape: ie making things work on debian isn't high priority?
[16:47] isaacs: arnau_: probably a recent change didn't get merged into it
[16:47] aguynamedben has joined the channel
[16:47] arnau_: ok
[16:48] lukstr: mape: things don't work on debian?
[16:48] mape: lukstr: nope
[16:48] isaacs: mape: making things compile and run properly on debian is a high priority.  making deb packages that are blessed by debian-stable is not.
[16:48] isaacs: mape: what doens't work on debian?
[16:48] CoverSlide: debian only runs stuff 2 years old or older
[16:48] mape: isaacs: https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/676
[16:48] isaacs: i compile node there all the time
[16:48] CoverSlide: the debian motto is it's not stable unless it's obsolete
[16:48] mape: isaacs: and https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/880
[16:48] drudge: addisonj: yeah, that is the best i've seen so far
[16:49] mape: I'm still stuck at v0.4.5 because of it
[16:49] mape: If there is an easy fix I would love to hear it
[16:49] CoverSlide: Archlinux FTW!!!!
[16:49] isaacs: mape: ah, hm.
[16:49] mscdex: archlinux: the official linux distribution of st. louis
[16:49] isaacs: mape: does that patch fix it for you?  just checked, and my ubuntu box is 0.4.4, so that's actually not as often as i thought :)
[16:50] lukstr: mape: super weird I'm at latest
[16:50] CoverSlide: and mcdonald's
[16:50] mape: isaacs: To be honest I didn't try it, I try to stick to vanilla, easier that way
[16:50] masm has left the channel
[16:50] isaacs: fair enough
[16:50] mape: Seems like something that would be merged soon enough
[16:50] isaacs: i'll look into this.
[16:50] isaacs: yeah, it's not very controversial on teh face of it
[16:50] arnau_: one question, is nodejs stable enough on debian to be run on production servers?
[16:50] addisonj: drudge, if i had an array of the options I could do a for each and just add selected = true, if the values match, that is probably what I will do
[16:51] isaacs: just an ifdef

[17:25] ibolmo: hehe it's a small script, anyway
[17:26] ibolmo: all it does is go through a ./ and find # todo statements
[17:26] mape: ibolmo: unless you add a todo, in which case you move it from an object into an array
[17:26] ibolmo: mape: i'm confused
[17:26] ibolmo: what do you mean?
[17:26] mape: ibolmo: todos[milestone] will never be true
[17:27] mape: hence it will always end up being [], so why not start with todos = [];
[17:27] ibolmo: sure it will, i'm not sure what you mean
[17:27] mape: and drop the if
[17:27] mape: what line uses todo as an object?
[17:27] ibolmo: oh 'cus of the blank milestone
[17:27] ibolmo: ''
[17:27] arpegius has joined the channel
[17:28] ibolmo: 41
[17:28] mape: emitter.on('todo', function(file, by, milestone, todo){ ?
[17:28] ibolmo: starts at 41
[17:28] ibolmo: 42 inits to [] for the todos = {} in 39
[17:28] ibolmo: it's just a bucket list
[17:29] ibolmo: todos are indexed by milestone
[17:29] yozgrahame1 has joined the channel
[17:29] mape: yeah so why init it as an object if it is never used as such?
[17:29] ibolmo: anyway, that's all working.. just wondering why process.on('exit', .. would quit early and not let a forEach finish
[17:29] ibolmo: um it is.. indexed by milestone
[17:30] ibolmo: todos['1.1'].push(['./file', 'ibolmo', 'this is my todo'])
[17:30] ibolmo: for example
[17:30] mape: so you start of saying todos is an object, then if it isn't used (which it never is) you transfer it into an array, and then use the array as a hash table?
[17:31] mape: oh..
[17:31] ibolmo: um it is used..
[17:31] mape: nm, I'm dumb
[17:31] mape: sry
[17:31] ibolmo: haha thanks :D
[17:31] ibolmo: but back to the question.. why would process.on('exit', ... exit early
[17:32] ibolmo: wondering if there's a proc/child/spawn that sends a SIGNT and the event is called during that block
[17:32] mape: ibolmo: Object.keys(todos).forEach(function(todoKey){}) is neat but yeah..
[17:32] CoverSlide: ibolmo: line 72: entry[2™] why is there a ™ there?
[17:32] ibolmo: if so, then i know that in linux there's a finite amount of time before it terminates permanently
[17:32] ibolmo: CoverSlide: that was probably me :D
[17:32] ibolmo: (during copy paste)
[17:32] CoverSlide: i know that ™ key i hit all the time
[17:33] mape: ibolmo: seeing how the things you do in the exit event are sync I'd assume it will run before the process dies
[17:33] ibolmo: right mape, thought so as well
[17:34] mape: "Emitted when the process is about to exit. This is a good hook to perform constant time checks of the module's state (like for unit tests). The main event loop will no longer be run after the 'exit' callback finishes, so timers may not be scheduled."

[17:37] tjholowaychuk: url(/images/image.png)
[17:38] brraaains: ok thats what i was wondering. wasnt sure if i needed url(). thanks
[17:38] ibolmo: ryah: sorry to bug, but do you have an idea why i'd get an incomplete printout (as if it was interrupted) on a process.on('exit' callback?
[17:38] tjholowaychuk: stylus doesn't special-case properties or tryto guess what a url is etc

[17:46] CoverSlide: nesting styles for a cascading language makes sense
[17:46] tjholowaychuk: it's nicer looking if you dont go out of control
[17:46] tjholowaychuk: but for people with bad taste
[17:47] tjholowaychuk: it gets really hard to read
[17:47] brraaains: yeah i think css without braces looks way better. much easier to read
[17:47] tjholowaychuk: most programmers do notttt have "the eye"
[17:47] rpj8: when posting data in express, the post is sent in the form of json. I can't access this data with req.body.user if I have something like {"user":"doug"}. how would I render something like this?
[17:47] CoverSlide: curly braces suck
[17:47] mape: tjholowaychuk: I'm just color blind. But color codes help with that ;)

[18:09] Shrink: node.js is non-blocking and all. Then why is express not concurrent?
[18:09] CoverSlide: tr running NODE_ENV=production node app.js
[18:09] mscdex: Shrink: it is
[18:09] CoverSlide: in dev it isn't
[18:09] Shrink: ok
[18:09] mscdex: eh?
[18:10] CoverSlide: at least that's what i got
[18:10] mscdex: how can it not be concurrent? it's using the built-in http Server is it not?
[18:10] CoverSlide: i ran an express app that did setTimeout(res.end,5000)
[18:10] adnam: node runs on a single thread so it can't be concurrent, or am i mistaken?
[18:11] patrickjst has joined the channel
[18:11] mscdex: adnam: it's evented
[18:11] adnam: right
[18:11] CoverSlide: i opened it in two tabs
[18:11] yhahn: O_O
[18:11] CoverSlide: without NODE_ENV=production, took 10 seconds to load both
[18:11] adnam: the asynchronicity does not imply concurrency
[18:11] CoverSlide: with NODE_ENV=production it took 5
[18:11] adnam: it just implies that it can fork out other processes
[18:12] adnam: node still only uses one thread
[18:12] kkaefer: CoverSlide: try running   ab -c 50 -n 1000 http://....
[18:12] Shrink: nopes, not working, still blocking one request for another
[18:12] mscdex: adnam: erm, but it doesn't fork out processes for incoming requests
[18:12] rfay has joined the channel
[18:12] adnam: the http server is a different process which might itself be threaded
[18:12] mscdex: what?
[18:12] mscdex: the http server is within node
[18:13] mscdex: same process
[18:13] lukstr: Shrink: can you be a bit more specific about what is blocking?
[18:13] mscdex: unless you're talking about using apache + node
[18:13] stepheneb_ has joined the channel
[18:13] adnam: okay i might not be correct about that, but a htp server MAY be separate and threaded
[18:13] Shrink: I just build a simple app.get setInterval write
[18:14] mscdex: adnam: not in node
[18:14] Shrink: When I open it in two tabs, the second one is blocked
[18:14] mscdex: Shrink: browser setting maybe?
[18:14] adnam: mscdex: you are free to start any process from node
[18:14] lukstr: Shrink: you are doing something wrong then... you can't block in your response, can you paste some code?
[18:14] Shrink: no, because it works when I do it in plain node.js
[18:14] tjholowaychuk has joined the channel
[18:14] mscdex: adnam: sure, but it doesn't automatically create new processes for requests
[18:15] Shrink: wait
[18:15] CoverSlide: if you have 20 requests hitting a threaded server, and 20 requests hitting an evented server, the evented requests get 100% of the cpu, while the threaded ones get 5%, after the initial warming up of the threads
[18:15] adnam: anyway, point is, node runs on a single thread, with an event loop, so any action performed in that event loop will stall other events in node
[18:15] Vladimir1 has joined the channel
[18:15] lukstr: adnam: yes
[18:15] mscdex: adnam: right, that's why it's important to not block and to have async mechanisms
[18:16] adnam: right right
[18:16] lukstr: CoverSlide: it doesn't work the same as a threaded server...
[18:16] Shrink: http://fpaste.org/qE3s/
[18:16] Shrink: lukstr, 
[18:16] mscdex: adnam: and almost everything in node is async, so it's generally not a problem
[18:17] mscdex: adnam: unless you're calculating primes or something
[18:17] lukstr: Shrink: yes that won't work
[18:17] adnam: right right
[18:17] adnam: so where were we going with this
[18:17] mscdex: adnam: but even with a task like that, you could break it up into parts using nextTick
[18:17] Shrink: lukstr, why ?
[18:17] mscdex: adnam: i dunno, but you made it sound like node used additional processes for incoming http requests :)
[18:17] Shrink: just forget the app.get('/stop/')

[19:31] dve: evening all
[19:31] dve: Ive been thinking about logging and how i trace what is going on in my app. At the moment I seem to be using a lot of sys.puts (in one form or another) and its a mess. I was thinking of some way of emitting info, that way I could listen for emitted info and either log it or use the event in my tests. I could then also have some sort of listener that rendered out the info in a graphical way, maybe a web interface. Does something like this already exist? Is there any
[19:31] dve:  existing built in tracing functionality?

[19:40] brainproxy: dve: yes, it makes sense, I have something like that in mind as well
[19:40] jbpros has joined the channel
[19:40] brainproxy: but if you want it to be ubiquitous in your code
[19:40] brainproxy: then its probably something you'd build into some kind of continuation  passing mechanism

[19:41] Yoric has joined the channel

[20:08] doki_pen: is there a change to the way npm treats packages from 0.4.3 to 0.4.8?  my package no longer exports anything
[20:08] isaacs: doki_pen: do you have a "main" module?
[20:08] isaacs: doki_pen: to answer your question, npm doens't treat packages differently based on the node version.  but there were major changes in 0.2->0.3 of npm itslef.
[20:09] ibolmo: isaacs: ever run into trouble with process.on('exit' ? i'm reading the docs and the only clue I have is that it says "constant time" so I figure that means that process.on('exit' eventually interrupts?

[21:41] malkomalko: ahh I think I know why tjholowaychuk.. we're trying to use the repo with an ssh git url that is password protected, so it must be that deploy isn't asking for that password, looks like we may have to use a user with ssh keys to the git machine

[23:57] christopherbull: hey guys, i'm having some serious trouble grokking how to actually implement something in haraka. I'm reading the docs but I still haven't jumped a mental barrier I think.  What I want is pretty simple: when an email comes in to a certain address, sending address + body become a JSON object which is POST'd to a local api call within our app cluster.  I understand that I need to make a plugin, but I'm kinda lost as to how to actually do that (and 
[23:57] christopherbull: getting very confused by the docs) is anyone able to explain what the simplest way to do this is? thanks :)
