[01:36] bnoordhuis: server.address() doesn't return anything until after the listening event btw

[01:36] mikeric has joined the channel

[01:37] konobi: listen() can cause stuff to listen on more than one interface or address... or even the same address, but also ipv6 encoded...
[01:38] Glenjamin_: ah, hadn't considered that
[01:39] Glenjamin_: gah, 0.4 tries to DNS lookup '127.0.0.1' and fails :(
[01:39] Glenjamin_: maybe 0.4 support is pointless

[01:51] tbranyen: I've got some fixes and enhancements for NativeControls
[01:51] tbranyen: I should send in a pull req
[01:52] konobi: maxogden: .bc.ca?

[01:53] maxogden: konobi: well adobe bought nitobi and nitobi is moving phonegap to apache and renaming it 'callback'
[01:53] konobi: maxogden: cordova was the last name i heard...
[01:54] maxogden: so brian, lunny and a few others are moving to the san francisco bro area to work at adobe hq for a while
[01:54] konobi: i know all the nitobi guys pretty well
[01:54] maxogden: they settled on Callback
[01:54] konobi: you're shitting me... worst name EVER
[01:55] maxogden: almost as bad as node
[01:55] konobi: heh
[01:55] maxogden: i would have called node pizza.js, thats way easier to google
[01:55] maxogden: and more rich with visual metaphor
[01:55] konobi: 'nodejs' is generally reasonable
[01:55] draz: hey, how would I go about annotating an array of a json object in Mongoose?
[01:56] maxogden: tbranyen: i am about to use nativecontrols in a project so you should push your enhancements :D
[01:56] Glenjamin_: aha, turns out 0.4.x http.request can't take http: '127.0.0.1:1337', which is what url.parse returns
[01:56] konobi: maxogden: i would love to play with phonegap on android/google tv... but seems trickey
[01:56] Glenjamin_: host: '127.0.0.1:1337' even
[01:57] draz: var mySchema = new Schema({ criteria: [ { age : { minage: Number, maxAge: Number.... }]
[01:57] maxogden: google tv runs android?
[01:57] konobi: yup
[01:57] maxogden: thats pretty cool
[01:57] MooGoo: wtf is google tv
[01:57] konobi: yeah, infil00p over at nitobi got phonegap got that running recently

[09:40] GrizzLyCRO: well, i think i have one idea how that works under the hood, and i think it is great for large load servers
[09:40] GrizzLyCRO: especially on nice multicore systems
[09:40] Lingerance: Not really, it's single-threaded
[09:40] Lingerance: You need multiple processes if you want to use more than one core.
[09:40] GrizzLyCRO: i know
[09:41] GrizzLyCRO: using something like load balancer should not be so hard?
[09:43] Lingerance: ACTION uses one
[09:43] GrizzLyCRO: is it hard to use it?
[09:44] Lingerance: Depends on which one and what you're trying to make it do

[11:20] EuroNerd: I need some advice:  I'd like to start experimenting with node.js ASAP, so I'm going to install a linux server in VirtualBox. What kind of server would you recommend as the easiest/fastest to set up? XAMPP? Oracle's prebuilt VMs? Something else?
[11:21] zomg: EuroNerd: Ubuntu is probably pretty straightforward
[11:21] broofa has joined the channel
[11:22] AAA_awright_0: Gentoo obviously
[11:22] zilch_ has joined the channel
[11:23] EuroNerd: I should also point out I'm rather clueless about Linux. I'm able to install Ubuntu Desktop (actually using one right now ;), but if I'll have to configure something in command line, I'm gonna waste two days trying to figure it out.
[11:23] AAA_awright_0: ... Once you get past the 16 hours or so of initial compiling it's actually a great platform, I use it for three servers and this desktop
[11:23] EuroNerd: lol
[11:23] zomg: EuroNerd: there are guides on the internets for installing node in ubuntu so you should be able to start pretty easily
[11:23] EuroNerd: AAA_awright_0, as I said, "easiest/fastest" to set up. 
[11:24] EuroNerd: zomg, would you recommend Ubuntu Server or will Desktop run just as good, but with GUI? ;)
[11:24] zomg: Both should work
[11:25] zomg: You probably will be doing most things from the terminal though (eg. run the app, install packages from npm etc.)
[11:25] AAA_awright_0: I would avoid Ubuntu, it doesn't deliver regular updates unless it's a "bug fix," which the buggy stuff when it's fixes is NEVER counted as a "bug fix" so you're stuck waiting 6 months
[11:25] zomg: Well it's better at delivering them than Debian :p
[11:25] zomg: At least if you have Debian stable
[11:25] zomg: =)
[11:26] zomg: considering he's already familiar with ubuntu it is probably the best option for him
[11:26] AAA_awright_0: On that note I would avoid npm too
[11:26] EuroNerd: OK, so I'll probably settle for the latest Ubuntu Desktop LTS (11.04)... What do I need to put on top?  Node.js obviously, probably MySQL, anything else?
[11:27] johnnywengluu has joined the channel
[11:27] zomg: node and npm, although I think they started bundling npm with node itself now?
[11:27] AAA_awright_0: Please no
[11:27] zomg: Oh, you probably also need git
[11:27] AAA_awright_0: Git is a must
[11:27] AAA_awright_0: Git, build utils
[11:27] AAA_awright_0: Wait are we compiling this from source?
[11:27] AAA_awright_0: That's the only way I've seen it done
[11:27] EuroNerd: I hope not :-P
[11:27] AAA_awright_0: It's not hard
[11:27] EuroNerd: I just want to install it and have it running in 10 minutes. 
[11:27] zomg: Yeah it's basically just ./configure && make && sudo make install
[11:28] Frippe has joined the channel
[11:28] EuroNerd: I'm hoping I can get node.js with one line of apt-get  ;)
[11:28] zomg: it took less than 10 minutes on my cheap VPS =)
[11:28] AAA_awright_0: git clone <node> Node.js && cd Node.js && ./configure && make && sudo make install
[11:28] AAA_awright_0: One line
[11:29] AAA_awright_0: If you have the packages installed, I'm on Gentoo so that comes free so idk what the apt packages are, but I think the development libraries usually ship separately
[11:29] EuroNerd: OK, thanks guys.

[16:39] JakeyChan: by the way

[17:34] Aria: (If the latter, the code is pretty easy.)
[17:35] Aria: (If not, you need to know when you get 'em all, and that means a completion callback -- which would be super annoying if Mongoose doesn't provide it)

[17:58] Aria: interrupt: 10K+ -- you start running into OS limits, and it depends on which backend libuv is using.

[17:59] r04r has joined the channel
[17:59] Dulak: interrupt: directly it's ram bound really, but if you set things up right, you can do 10k connections on even low grade hardware.
[17:59] Aria: Yeah. RAM is one place; OS limits on file descriptors another.
[18:00] Aria: If you're using an OS without well-optimized libuv backends (like if it falls to select() or something insane), you'll not scale that high.
[18:00] Aria: Ephemeral port limits, too -- every TCP connection needs a free port. Some OSes need tuning to get more available for use.
[18:00] Aria: And even so you're limited to 64K per IP.

[20:05] turboneat: Guys. What's the deal with Node.js?
[20:06] lifty: hi *; I am trying to understand how nodejs modules work and I cant find a way to define a constructor function for a module. Is anything like this even possible in nodejs modules? My main  gripe is that I have to always do the initialization in two steps. something along the lines: 1. var m = require('module'); 2. m.init('value'). Is it possible to initialize a module from the 
[20:06] lifty:  getgowith some valu es?
[20:06] Aria: bbommarito: you may be able to not do so -- a closure might do the job.
[20:06] Aria: turboneat: It's fast, it's light, it's low level and yet still highly usable.
[20:06] cha0s has joined the channel
[20:06] cha0s has joined the channel
[20:06] r04r: lifty: You can do require('module').init('value') if that's what you wanted?
[20:07] SirFunk: does node have a better supported orm/database than mongoose/mongodb ?
[20:07] xeodox has joined the channel
[20:07] lifty: yep, thats a possibility. so there no 'native' way of doing it
[20:07] lifty: i guess im just tring to frame my understanding according to the old oop paradigm
[20:08] r04r: lifty: Not exactly sure what you want. But, the require() syntax only ever creates one instance of the module you try to load, so if you call it multiple times it will return the same object. If you want code to run when it's first created, you can just put it in the module and that works. Or am I misunderstanding your intentions?
[20:09] r04r: bbiab
[20:10] MooGoo: hm
[20:10] MooGoo: isn't module one of the variables exported to loaded module code
[20:10] MooGoo: or some such..
[20:11] lifty: well, what I am trying to achieve is defining a class/function in a module, and use it to instantiate new objects with different values. I would want a new object with each require.
[20:13] MooGoo: modules.exports = YourClass
[20:13] Aria: SirFunk: There's lots of database access modules -- postgresql, mysql, mongo, couch, plus anything you can speak HTTP at.
[20:13] Aria: SirFunk: ORMs are considered by many an anti-pattern, though, so there's fewer of those than you might expect.

[21:28] augustl: a lot of stuff is not yet decent
[21:29] Aria: HEh. I've used every package manager out there.
[21:29] Aria: npm makes me happy since it plays linker rather than package manager.

[21:30] Aria: Why so, AAA_awright?
[21:31] woeye: Izkiss, I don't know. But it's really ridiculous. Asking for modern technology like responsive design, HTML5! and things like that and then demanding IE6 support. Problem is, imho, that we tried to support IE6/7 way too long with all kinds of workarounds and hacks. Now those people think: what's all the fuss about? On my IE6 everything just works fine!

[21:34] Aria: Yeah. We finally killed it at work, and we're pretty conservative there.
[21:34] AAA_awright: Aria: A lot of horrible design decisions that's going to stick around with it... Not that it was designed so much as horrible features seem to have been copied, and then written with a horrible API, at least initially
[21:35] secoif: AAA_awright can you give concrete examples
[21:35] AAA_awright: Getting there... I see my package managers and build systems as doing essentially the same thing, there's a whole different design paradigm they need

[21:36] swaj: it appears some middleware (and right now I'm pointing at connect-session) is sending a 200 OK response before my router code executes, so throwing a 404 from my router is bombing...
[21:36] AAA_awright: The thing that made me really hate npm was just the API, or lack of it. It was a program very closely tied to static locations for file paths and there was just no way to ask it to "install this package in this location", absolutely impossible
[21:36] TooTallNate has joined the channel
[21:36] AAA_awright: Appearently that's changed, I can't see it
[21:37] swaj: there isn't, really.  You can install a package globally, or in ./node_modules/ (which node has standardized)
[21:38] AAA_awright: My big issue with package managers npm included is that packages are barely even meaningful, when you install them they provide a package, and that's it. So you get these bizarre concepts like how npm packages can depend on an "engine"
[21:38] corpix has joined the channel
[21:38] AAA_awright: It certainly fixes the problem it intends to solve but it doesn't solve the underlying problem that package managers are stupid

[21:38] secoif: AAA_awright packages get broken when node api changes?
[21:38] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[21:39] secoif: thus the packages can specify which engine to run on
[21:39] AAA_awright: So why not make node a package?
[21:39] AAA_awright: It's the same thing, just a different namespace
[21:39] AAA_awright: Except no, npm has entirely different code to handle engines versus packages
[21:39] swaj: because node is necessary for npm to even run.  why would the runtime be a package itself?
[21:40] AAA_awright: It's like Drupal having three nearly identical APIs to handle users, nodes, and comments, even though they're the SAME THING
[21:40] secoif: that's not a bad idea
[21:40] secoif: AAA_awright drupal has the worst api in the world
[21:40] swaj: s/drupal/php/
[21:40] AAA_awright: I use the Drupal API
[21:40] AAA_awright: Barely
[21:40] secoif: drupal is worse than php
[21:41] secoif: php at least has some basic 'types'
[21:41] AAA_awright: I was coding my CMS to work like Drupal, I figured it's bad but I can replace all the PHPisms with Nodejsisms and it'll be good
[21:41] AAA_awright: BAD IDEA
[21:42] Aria: Hehe.
[21:42] churp: hey, is there such a thing as a global EventEmitter. I'm trying to listen to every event that is fired and not only the event that gets fired from one emitter.
[21:42] Aria: I agree that a full-scope package manager enables a different set of tools. There's a reason I use RPM.
[21:42] augustl: node isn't made for web apps, though
[21:42] AvianFlu: churp: the process object is an event emitter
[21:42] augustl: it's made for networking apps
[21:42] Aria: But I actually really like the "link me an app" feeling of npm. I like that it doesn't really try very hard to be a system-wide package manager.
[21:43] AvianFlu: but that won't help the second part of your question
[21:43] secoif: churp but you can't capture events from different event emitters unless they are somehow linked
[21:43] secoif: churp sounds like you need an event bus.
[21:43] AvianFlu: churp: what secoif said
[21:43] enmand has joined the channel
[21:43] AAA_awright: Anyways, I mentioned I see my build systems and package managers as being the same thing, similar concept... They actually do the same thing at a higher level, they take resources and make them other types of resources. Build systems take source code and transform it into executable code, package managers take information resources and install them on your system.
[21:43] AAA_awright: Note that both build systems and package managers let you install the software to your system, AND let you package it for shipping to someone else
[21:43] AAA_awright: At least the good ones do
[21:43] AAA_awright: Why are we replicating that code for two slightly different uses?
[21:43] secoif: and you can use the process event emitter as an event bus. Though that smells bad to me.
[21:44] AvianFlu: you could also use EventEmitter2, which has wildcards
[21:44] AvianFlu: and namespaced events
[21:44] swaj: I don't really buy the "node isn't made for web apps" line.  That's one of the best use cases for it.
[21:44] Aria: I've not yet met a build system I like.
[21:44] Aria: swaj: The second half of the statement really shows what's up. Node is for networked apps. web apps are a subset of that.
[21:44] AAA_awright: I use "good" in a relative sense
[21:44] AAA_awright: Meaning sucks less than the others
[21:44] secoif: a web app is a networking app?
[21:45] mdel has joined the channel
[21:45] Aria: Well, web without networking is kinda ... useless.
[21:45] AAA_awright: Until Linus wrote Git the same was true for revision control systems
[21:45] churp: AvianFlu, secoif, thanks. Event Bus sound good. Is there already on implemented?
[21:46] secoif: AvianFlu you just need to make a single EventEmitter instance accessible to each of your modules
[21:47] AvianFlu: secoif, yes, true
[21:47] AvianFlu: personally, I'd enjoy having namespaces and wildcards for that, but you're right
[21:47] AAA_awright: secoif: Here's the thing: Build systems and package managers need to understand resources, both information resources (the "tangable" ones like files and directories) and data resources (like functions, methods, variables, programs, package listings, etc) in terms of what functionality they provide, NOT a simple list of "Here's the commands you run to build this program, here's another list of commands you run to install it"
[21:48] AAA_awright: So then you can say "Compile this program" and the build system looks at the resources and decides how to do that, which resources are used to build the program, and figure out what program will compile them
[21:48] AAA_awright: You shouldn't ever have to know what gcc is
[21:48] secoif: AAA_awright sounds like magic
[21:48] AAA_awright: Except maybe to say "This program uses gcc-specific quirks"
[21:49] Dulak: That's about 15 minutes before skynet launches the nukes....
[21:49] AAA_awright: Maybe it is
[21:50] AAA_awright: But I have some amount of code already using that paradigm to generate webpages: http://magnode.org/
[21:50] secoif: churp just share EventEmitter/EventEmitter2 instance around. 
[21:50] AAA_awright: And here's my spec for a possible build system should look and feel: http://bzfx.net/guru/
[21:51] boltR has joined the channel
[21:51] AAA_awright: And that's not just a build system, that's also a package manager, too.

[21:52] secoif: it's hard to read.

[21:54] jesusabdullah: AAA_awright: Were you the one thinking about building an rdf-based build system?
[21:54] AAA_awright: Yeah
[21:54] jesusabdullah: oh, yes, linked up there
[21:54] AAA_awright: If you know people who know compilers inside and out, they're welcome to help, this requires defining what types of content a compiler can take in, and what it outputs, and the switches and arguments and such
[21:54] jesusabdullah: I was looking at jake the other day, and I bet you could reach feature parity with *that* pretty quick
[21:54] AAA_awright: But it's essentially the same as the website engine I have, it takes in a database entry and outputs a webpage
[21:55] jesusabdullah: Where's that?
[21:55] AAA_awright: And there's lots of types and subtypes and such that it processes and various different ways the inputs interact with each other but that's the overview
[21:55] scttnlsn has joined the channel
[21:55] AAA_awright: jesusabdullah: http://magnode.org/
[21:55] jesusabdullah: Oh, yeah, for every tool you support you would need to have a model for inputs and outputs and stuff
[21:55] jesusabdullah: I bet starting out just supporting, like, a few js build tools would be handy
[21:56] npa has joined the channel
[21:56] AAA_awright: It's pretty basic, you just need to define "Okay here's how a gcc/icc/whatever works" and bam, you can now generate executables from source code
[21:56] jesusabdullah: and later you can make it grok gcc and friends
[21:56] boltR has joined the channel
[21:56] AAA_awright: No need to invoke gcc yourself, it figures out what to use based on what it sees and what you ask the output to be
[21:56] tilgovi has joined the channel

[21:56] jesusabdullah: we know javascript right?
[21:57] jesusabdullah: It'd be like instantly useful without having to master gcc is what I'm sayin'
[21:57] AAA_awright: As I said, the website does the same thing, I provide a URI and a database, and I ask for a complete webpage, and it uses a series of functions to generate it, I don't even specify what the functions are, it figures it out automatically by looking at the input types and requested output
[21:57] Dulak: AAA_awright: you need to cut the copy in half for magnode, it's too wordy for most people.  Sounds good though, just needs trimming.
[21:57] AAA_awright: Dulak: Yeah...
[21:58] jesusabdullah: haha, magnode.com is an aluminum extrusion manufacturing shop
[21:58] jesusabdullah: and their site requires flash
[21:58] secoif: AAA_awright so basically, rather than storing my package.json along with the module, it's stored in a db in your system?
[21:58] mmalecki: AAA_awright: do you have some code?
[21:58] AAA_awright: Yeah, that website is self-hosting, the code is...
[21:59] jesusabdullah: http://git.bzfx.net/~aaa/magnode.git/
[21:59] AAA_awright: mmalecki: http://git.bzfx.net/~aaa/magnode.git/ It'll be thrown on Github when there's a release of some sort
[21:59] jesusabdullah: I'm gonna mirror this on github >:o
[22:00] Dulak: AAA_awright: on the /doc page I suggest moving the install info to the top of the page and telling the story under that
[22:00] AAA_awright: I'll split apart the sections, they would be entirely different books if they were published as books
[22:00] AAA_awright: But yeah, that's important
[22:01] Dulak: AAA_awright: yeah just trying to make it easier for you to get users, people don't like to read, generally
[22:01] secoif: AAA_awright I get real worried when I see any file with DB calls and inline HTML http://git.bzfx.net/~aaa/magnode.git/tree/lib/transform.DocumentHTML_BodyAuto_typeMongoDB_Form.js?id=59a7f4a6f5b823641cc1ca01682cb5940a129e7d

[22:03] AAA_awright: jesusabdullah: There's a magnode.org.js file that links all of those files together into something you can use, there's a format.n3 file that contains the info on each data type and how to format them, and some jade templates linked to in the format.n3 file

[22:18] mmalecki: what's the good practice for writing modules both for browser and node?
[22:19] tbranyen: don't
[22:19] mmalecki: tbranyen: care to explain?
[22:20] augustl: mmalecki: not that much really, I typically just do an if test
[22:20] AAA_awright: jesusabdullah: http://magnode.org/src/magnode.org.js There's the actual program
[22:20] mmalecki: augustl: if (window) ?
[22:20] AAA_awright: jesusabdullah: http://magnode.org/src/data/format.n3 There's the data
[22:20] tbranyen: mmalecki: if you don't care about browser support at all, writing code that works between the two is pretty easy
[22:21] AAA_awright: http://magnode.org/src/template/ There's the templates it refers to
[22:21] augustl: mmalecki: https://gitorious.org/buster/buster-core/blobs/1f8ac20/lib/buster-core.js#line76

[22:22] AAA_awright: Watch out for commented old sections I should probably take those out...
[22:22] tbranyen: mmalecki: you can take nearly everything for granted in Node, since v8 is pretty darn stable in terms of what it supports
[22:22] augustl: mmalecki: another example https://github.com/cjohansen/Sinon.JS/blob/master/lib/sinon.js#L239
[22:22] tbranyen: complete opposite in the browser
[22:23] tbranyen: also in the browser you can take for granted things that exist there, such as window.open, which exists in all browsers, but not in Node
[22:23] augustl: mmalecki: and in a couple of weeks time you'll have busterjs.org for easy mode testing of the same code in both browsers and node ;)

[22:24] mmalecki: tbranyen: ok, I think I understand
[22:25] tbranyen: mmalecki: some libs work fantastic in both environments, but i can see it turning into a rabbit hole, unless you take precautions and keep it generic
[22:26] AAA_awright: Dulak: Moved the sections around, I like that better
[22:27] Dulak: AAA_awright: yeah, much easier to 'jump right in' with that layout
[22:27] maushu: Why does the 'ondata' method of a socket return a SlowBuffer and the 'data' event return a Buffer?
[22:27] augustl: maushu: :O
[22:28] Dulak: AAA_awright: now just cut your copy on the front page in half and up your contrast a bit on the headers and you'll be cooking with gas
[22:28] AAA_awright: The afact it's named SlowBuffer suggests it's a peformance optimization
[22:28] augustl: tbranyen: I think you're being pessimistic :P
[22:28] augustl: and/or realistic
[22:28] augustl: most cross node/browser modules don't do DOM stuff etc.
[22:28] jarek has joined the channel
[22:28] jarek has joined the channel
[22:29] tbranyen: augustl: setTimeout/setInterval are technically DOM
[22:29] tbranyen: but are implemented in Node luckily
[22:29] augustl: not sure what your point is
[22:29] tbranyen: its easy to use things that are DOM without even knowing it
[22:29] maushu: AAA_awright, SlowBuffer is a C++ buffer, Buffer is a javascript implemented one that wraps around the SlowBuffer (and doesn't change it when its "sliced").
[22:30] augustl: what's part of which specification is irrelevant
[22:30] augustl: what matters are the documented APIs
[22:30] AAA_awright: Dulak: Yeah thanks! I'll give the front page some love once I have something released, probably a blog, so that'll all be re-worked to suit that
[22:31] benlyng has joined the channel
[22:31] tbranyen: augustl: well unfortunately based on which specification almost entirely determines how well its documented :)
[22:31] Dulak: AAA_awright: g'luck with it, very interesting idea
[22:32] tbranyen: specifically with how the browser can treat a DOM method from a user defined method
[22:33] augustl: it's funny how the documentation of APIs in browsers is a hive mind collective intelligence type thing
[22:33] tbranyen: Object.keys is the one method that kills me isn't in every browser.  i think Opera just got it, pretty sure Safari still doesn't

[22:38] maxogden: you could just use the _.keys function

[23:48] tbranyen: OBonio: the event loop is single threaded
[23:50] OBonio: so a process is not a thread?
[23:51] robertj: processes are heavier than threads
[23:51] robertj: each process will have at least one thread of its own

[23:53] OBonio: from what I've seen, node.js needs to spawn processes to do 'things'
[23:54] robertj: the event loop calls stuff outside node and then checks back on them to see when they are done
[23:54] augustl: OBonio: "things" is pretty vague
[23:54] robertj: it will manage a thread pull for all it's async stuff
[23:55] jbrokc_ has joined the channel
[23:56] OBonio: yes, 'things' is vague, the example I've seen uses 'ls' to display a list of files... ls is an executable necessitating a process?
[23:56] robertj: OBonio, so your gonna call ls and have a callback when ls is done
[23:56] augustl: OBonio: yes
[23:56] robertj: it's gonna create a thread and run ls and keep going with your code
[23:57] robertj: and then its gonna check back in on the status of that thread very often and run the hook when it fines ls is complete

[23:57] augustl: OBonio: you don't need to spawn processes to list files, though
[23:57] augustl: OBonio: you can stat "natively" with the fs module
[23:58] augustl: as in, via system calls, not external programs
[23:58] robertj: but basically its gonna check all the system calls after...every tick of the main loop?
[23:58] robertj: err event loop?

[23:59] kkszysiu has joined the channel
[23:59] augustl: not sure how node does system calls internally
[23:59] OBonio: so sytem calls within the event loop?
[23:59] augustl: I'd imagine it threads them and chunks them and what not, to avid blocking
[23:59] augustl: OBonio: yes
