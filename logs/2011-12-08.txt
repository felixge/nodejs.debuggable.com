[00:00] JmZ: the thing you're giving the callback to is calling it
[00:00] WarheadsSE: actually, he is
[00:00] JmZ: in my example i meant
[00:00] WarheadsSE: im not grasping the callback placement in your example though
[00:01] WarheadsSE: So you're looking for the anything, or for i, at that time, to be constant
[00:01] WarheadsSE: aka 1,2,3 not, i+10 or something
[00:01] JmZ: im looking for the i at the time the 'something' was called
[00:02] WarheadsSE: at the time the callback, or the something
[00:02] JmZ: which is why there's a problem because the callback may not run when 'something' is called
[00:02] JmZ: it may run a minute later, instantly, etc
[00:02] WarheadsSE: so you arent looking to pass i, your're looking to pass the /value/ of i
[00:02] JmZ: indeed, at the time the call associated with the given callback was made
[00:03] Fuu has joined the channel
[00:03] chapel: JmZ: why not pass i into the callback?
[00:03] chapel: you are sending i to something, well just send that i you have to the callback
[00:03] thepatr1ck: JmZ: do you control the something() function?
[00:03] JmZ: chapel can you give an example?
[00:03] chapel: well you would need to control something
[00:03] JmZ: am i just losing my mind or what because you can't pass anything to the callback
[00:04] JmZ: the internals run it, not you
[00:04] chapel: you can pass anything to the callback you want
[00:04] JmZ: how?
[00:04] JmZ: show me
[00:04] chapel: function something(i, cb) { cb(err, i) }
[00:04] chapel: when you invoke the callback, you send any arguments you want to it
[00:04] JmZ: I don't control something
[00:05] JmZ: so no, I cannot
[00:05] chapel: well you could wrap it
[00:05] JmZ: indeed i probably could
[00:05] JmZ: but nevermind, i'd rather not, I already changed the logic in my code while we were talking
[00:06] chapel: sometimes that is the best answer (to rethink it)
[00:06] chapel: could also do this
[00:06] chapel: function callback(i) { return function(err) { // do something with i }
[00:06] chapel: function callback(i) { return function(err) { // do something with i } }
[00:07] chapel: then something(i, callback(i))
[00:07] chapel: anyways

[00:35] prettyrobots: I'm asking if I can submit a patch where the callback is invoked with an additional boolean `true` if the request was handled.

[00:35] tjholowaychuk: i'd like to get 2.0 out and then work on 3x abstracting things more
[00:35] tjholowaychuk: static() has so many gears it should be an event emitter
[00:36] prettyrobots: If we make this change, then `connect.static.send` can be used with Streamline.js.

[01:00] Tprice: AvianFlu yeah thats what im using now but if i had 200 events to run it locks up the stack
[01:01] chrisdickinson: Tprice: you can use postMessage and onmessage to simulate a minimum-resolution-less setTimeout in browser.
[01:01] Tprice: anyway i think im off topic

[01:05] chrisdickinson: Tprice: setTimeout has a minimum resolution; setZeroTimeout (the message passing one) does not.

[03:35] darkenco has joined the channel
[03:35] devaholic: hmm, you are saying essentially to make the callback optional too. that could work but you would have no way to access the required files

[03:36] Leemp: With "n", how do you install/use/etc npm? n 0.5.10 installs 0.5.10, but my current version of npm doesn't work with 0.5.10 it seems. Thoughts?
[03:36] secoif: if it's not async, callback probably not necessary
[03:36] shannen: Does node compile on linux with python 3?
[03:36] secoif: Leemp the latest node is 0.6.5
[03:37] kerang: ryah: the change from c-ares to getaddrinfo for dns lookup in v0.5.10, is that purely to solve ipv4 ipv6 issue or any other problem w/ c-ares dns lookup?
[03:37] devaholic: secoif: that can be done. the callback was originally "each()
[03:37] devaholic: "
[03:37] secoif: Leemp bundled npm came in 0.6.4 or 0.6.3
[03:37] Leemp: secoif: Yea, i had the latest version of node, and the latest version of npm installed (i believe). But i need to use v0.5.10 for something, and i need an npm that will work with that
[03:37] devaholic: and it did return an array of the required files into it
[03:38] devaholic: i think i might add that back in and support both use cases
[03:38] Leemp: secoif: So, i ran "n 0.5.10" and now npm doesn't work, which makes sense.. but how do you go about using npm, with all the versions "n" lets you use?
[03:38] secoif: Leemp oh. I dunno, I never used any 0.5.x node, perhaps check the npm homepage
[03:38] Leemp: Ah, k
[03:39] secoif: Leemp install npm seperately 
[03:39] Leemp: secoif: I just assumed "n" had some type of npm management aswell

[03:42] Hello71: put another object around the module object inside an array
[03:42] bartt has joined the channel
[03:42] Hello71: could be faster if you're iterating just to find metadata

[03:45] secoif: devaholic that's pretty cool, though if you're going to nest subdirs, I'd like to have the option to get back a flattened list
[03:45] devaholic: if the directory you require contains a subdir it will require it, which may then require further subdirs, and so on, building an object

[03:47] secoif: haha
[03:48] secoif: ah well.
[03:48] devaholic: its sort of recursive-if-you-wanna
[03:48] devaholic: if your subdirs are without index files or other main entry points its not recursive
[03:49] secoif: devaholic yes. point.
[03:49] devaholic: also had the idea to filter out specific files... but we'll see how this goes first

[06:12] benvie: the second param is the starting value

[06:13] _th_n has joined the channel
[06:13] context: or im blind
[06:13] benvie: well then it's probably the first value of the array

[06:13] JaKWaC has joined the channel
[06:13] context: yeah thats why im partially confused

[09:17] secoif: skylamer` if you install express globally, I believe you can do something like express -t jade -c stylus and it will set up an app that will automatically compile your stylus/jade assets
[09:17] booyaa: i've yet to do any node dev using it, just mostly use it at work to wrangle xml

[09:18] skylamer`: i've also looked some thing like /bin/stylus, but isnt not working for me ...
[09:19] secoif: skylamer` you can install stylus globally, and that will allow you to compile from the commandline

[09:25] secoif: skylamer` npm should deal with that for you
[09:25] skylamer`: hmmm, k
[09:26] secoif: skylamer` I'd make sure you've installed via latest node installer
[09:26] toabi has left the channel
[09:26] secoif: skylamer` also, each project gets it's own node_modules folder.

[09:30] secoif: skylamer` basically, let's say you're working on your new money spinner app, and it's in the "C:/FacebookClone2" directory. if you `cd` into that directory and type `npm install express`, it will install express into C:/FacebookClone2/node_modules/express

[09:31] secoif: skylamer` if you type `npm install -g express` it will install express 'globally', which for most purposes means you will have access to the executable script for that module
[09:32] skylamer`: secoif, but, ok, why its installing it there when i have it in %APPDATA%
[09:32] skylamer`: ahh, i understand
[09:32] skylamer`: so there are some types of install, and it can be 'duplicating' for one, and -g is globally for all
[09:32] skylamer`: right?
[09:32] liar has joined the channel
[09:33] skylamer`: with install i am installing it many times, and -g i CAN use it on all of 'projects'?
[09:33] secoif: skylamer` you can't use a global installation in an app though
[09:33] secoif: np
[09:33] secoif: no.
[09:34] skylamer`: xaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[09:34] skylamer`: mmmmm
[09:34] secoif: skylamer` generally, you'll setup a package.json file which will contain all of the info about your project's modules
[09:34] skylamer`: yes, and -global install then is for using the 'modules' locally or ?
[09:34] secoif: skylamer` and then just cd into your project directory, and type `npm install` and it will look at the dependencies in the package.json and install all of them fort you
[09:35] skylamer`: by locally i mean from command line and can run in to local files

[09:35] aliem_ has joined the channel
[09:35] skylamer`: okay, thank you for your patience once m again, u help me alot:)
[09:36] secoif: skylamer` you get access to whatever executable scripts the module has exposed. not all modules have an executable mode 
[09:36] secoif: skylamer` …when you install a module globally
[09:36] secoif: skylamer` easiest way to configure your package.json is to use `npm init` in your project directory
[09:37] secoif: skylamer` it will prompt you for a bunch of info
[09:37] aesptux has joined the channel
[09:37] secoif: skylamer` then use `npm install --save express` to install express into the local node_modules folder and add an entry to your package.json
[09:38] skylamer`: i also experiencing errors, with some installs and their dependencies'', its saying im using "newer" version:)
[09:38] secoif: skylamer` make sure you're always running latest version of node and npm and you should have good time.
[09:39] skylamer`: i.e 'expresso'
[09:39] skylamer`: its latest
[09:39] secoif: skylamer` what version of node
[09:39] skylamer`: i looked to npm-debug.log
[09:39] skylamer`: 0.6.5
[09:39] secoif: ok
[09:39] skylamer`: a 1.1.0-alpha6 of npm:)

[17:15] TheJH: zomg, you want to do cpu profiling? or RAM?

[17:20] felixge: joshsmith: injecting just means that you can easily create "an instance" of what you are testing and control which "mysql client" instance it is using
[17:20] felixge: the simplest form would be to pass the mysql client object as a parameter into the function that does the work
[17:20] maletor has joined the channel
[17:20] felixge: in which case it's easy for you to pass a fake version in

[17:48] raz: yes it very much is
[17:49] raz: i'm trying to pin a deployment to a node/npm version here
[17:49] TheJH: zomg, " 63600   52.2%    0.0%  f57fe000-f57ff000" - you should re-run your code with a normal C profiler
[17:49] raz: curl-installers just don't fly in production
[17:49] TheJH: zomg, valgrind stuff or so
[17:49] isaacs: raz: if you think the design is broken, i'd like to know what you think is broken about it.  "broken by design" would imply that i intentionally made it broken, which is definitely false.
[17:49] raz: and sudo curl installers ... don't get me started
[17:49] arcanis has joined the channel
[17:49] isaacs: raz: you can download the installer and run it yourself, or just look at what it's doing.  it's not very complicated.
[17:49] raz: isaacs: it makes it impossible to predict what version gets installed. and it fails on me every time i change node version.
[17:49] raz: isaacs: are you the npm author?
[17:50] isaacs: raz: or you can just install node 0.6.5 with make install, and get npm 1.1.0-alpha-6, which is the latest most portable version
[17:50] isaacs: s
[17:50] isaacs: raz: yessir.

[17:50] TheJH: zomg, yes
[17:50] isaacs: raz: http://registry.npmjs.org/npm/
[17:50] raz: preferably along with the node-version that it is tested with
[17:50] isaacs: raz: like i said, the best thing to do right now is to just `make install` node 0.6.5
[17:51] raz: ah it ships with node now?
[17:51] isaacs: raz: this is tested on linux, windows, solaris, and os x, and is highly predictable.
[17:51] isaacs: yessir
[17:51] raz: ah, that sounds good
[17:51] isaacs: raz: if you want to *not* get npm, you can ./configure --without-npm
[17:51] raz: one headache less i hope
[17:51] raz: ACTION goes to fetch 0.6.5
[17:51] isaacs: that's the idea :)
[17:51] zomg: TheJH: Probably mongo native or something guessing from mongoose stuff being that high on the JS listing
[17:52] isaacs: raz: the reason why the version says "alpha" is that the javascript tar implementation is still very new.
[17:52] TheJH: zomg, maybe, but you should profile it anyway

[17:52] isaacs: raz: it'll be beta very soon, but there's still quite a bit of work to do
[17:52] raz: isaacs: i frankly don't care which version i get. i just need to be able to test a node/npm combo and then reliably deploy that very combo. in the past npm was completely unpredictable.
[17:52] zomg: TheJH: yep

[17:57] zomg: bnoordhuis: well it's not good when it's spiking a lot to 50-90 CPU use :D But yeah, at least it's probably doing something that should be fast, but perhaps it can be optimized some other way
[17:57] mmalecki: isaacs: like npm/v1.0.106.html ?

[17:57] isaacs: mmalecki: hm.  i dunno
[17:58] isaacs: mmalecki: let's start with just having the latest readme for each package as index.html

[17:58] mmalecki: alright!
[17:58] perezd_ has joined the channel
[17:58] bnoordhuis: zomg: the vdso is the userland part of the kernel, that's where syscalls like gettimeofday() end up
[17:58] mmalecki: so npm/index.html would be a readme for latest version?
[17:58] isaacs: docs.npmjs.org/blah should show something useful
[17:58] isaacs: mmalecki: sure
[17:58] mmalecki: ok!

[18:00] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: does your profiler work on 0.6?
[18:00] TheJH: mmalecki, yes

[20:08] TheJH: hotch, "async" for a little bit of async
[20:08] diogogmt has joined the channel
[20:08] TheJH: hotch, streamlinejs for much async
[20:08] TheJH: hotch, streamlinejs makes your async code look sync, it is a precompiler
[20:09] hotch: ahh ok
[20:09] rusintez: nice
[20:09] TheJH: hotch, you just put _ everywhere instead of callbacks and it works. and it has builtin promises
[20:09] iammerrick: hotch: Q tries to solve the same problem without a compiler
[20:09] hotch: i like that approach
[20:10] iammerrick: hotch: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules#wiki-async-flow
[20:10] TheJH: iammerrick, well, you still have callbacks there, no?

[20:11] TheJH: iammerrick, if you just want to write higher-level logic, I think streamlinejs is the best one
[20:11] TheJH: iammerrick, but I wouldn't tell people to use it in small libs or so
[20:11] iammerrick: TheJH: you have promises either way.
[20:12] TheJH: iammerrick, but with streamline, you have no extra indent and no function definitions everywhere. and it's easier to make a previously sync function async.
[20:12] pyparadigm has joined the channel
[20:12] iammerrick: TheJH: I don't know enough about streamline to debate but I have enjoyed Q a great deal, especially its implementation of joins for multiple promises (no 5 tabbing hehe). Any time I hear compiler or pre-comiler I am wary I am throwing away the very reason I use node, namely Isomorphic code.

[20:13] iammerrick: TheJH: correct
[20:13] jesusabdullah: TheJH: Yes, dual-sided

[20:15] TheJH: iammerrick, yes, that's the usual way - but you can also compile it inside the browser
[20:16] TheJH: iammerrick, actually, coffeescript lets you do <script type="text/coffeescript"> or so
[20:16] Margle has joined the channel
[20:16] iammerrick: TheJH: Not worth the performance hit, though that does make developing simpler. 
[20:16] TheJH: iammerrick, you just have to include a shim first

[20:16] snrmwg: a question using mysql in node: i need multiple selects to complete a request. i use mysql module for accessing db. so i nest multiple query calls in callback function of previous query callback. when should i call client.close()? how should i hande potential errors? try/catch doesn't seem so easy
[20:16] iammerrick: Also I tend to agree with using these things means giving up on JS.
[20:16] iammerrick: TheJH: all in all looks like a pretty cool and interesting project though :-)
[20:17] TheJH: iammerrick, streamline puts source file line numbers into the generated code and doesn't really alther the normal parts of your code

[20:19] swaj: it's not hard
[20:19] iammerrick: swaj: I tend to feel the same way.
[20:19] iammerrick: I much rather use a JS lib like Q for managing callbacks then a transpiler.
[20:19] iammerrick: sorry* compiler.
[20:19] TheJH: swaj, I basically agree
[20:20] TheJH: swaj, you should at least know how to do it right
[20:20] swaj: I mean you've got JS libs that make it so you can write a "class" in JS
[20:20] TheJH: swaj, but IMO you don't have to always stick to the classic way if other ways give you much shorter and more concise code
[20:21] swaj: I get that most people don't understand the prototype chain, but I argue that they *should*

[21:09] Fernandos: - I'm researching options for a realtime xml stream parser
[21:10] Fernandos: - in wich language do you develop nodejs modules? sorry I've really not worked with nodejs before. I know in ruby you can use C, is that also possible with nodejs modules, or is that even implied?
[21:10] CarterL has joined the channel
[21:10] topaxi: Fernandos: javascript or c++
[21:11] topaxi: ^^
[21:11] Fernandos: c++? so C should also be possible then I guess, right?
[21:11] Fernandos: - I'm just more familiar with ansi c, than c++
[21:11] topaxi: well i guess... but the API exposed by node would be c++
[21:12] topaxi: Fernandos: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.6.5/api/addons.html
[21:12] Fernandos: thank you topaxi - ok, I've found some "modules" for nodejs on http://search.npmjs.org/ that can parse xml.
[21:12] EyePulp: is an XML stream parser possible?  Wouldn't you need some verification of well-formedness, which requires reading the whole doc?
[21:12] Fernandos: - very interesting
[21:12] iRoj has joined the channel
[21:15] Fernandos: EyePulp: - It's not in my hands to guarantee well formednedss of that data feed, it's coming from an advertisement agency's proprietary solution that even relies on dtd instead of xsd.. so much for that part. It's a good point though, there should be some kind of validation before processing the data
[21:16] gsmcwhirter has joined the channel
[21:16] Fernandos: EyePulp: a slice of the feed I received is about 200mb
[21:17] isaacs: srruby: you still around?
[21:17] LeMike has joined the channel
[21:19] Fernandos: - oh, that's interesting.. I never heard about libuv, I assumed nodejs uses libev..
[21:19] topaxi: afaik they used libev, but had to write their own lib for windows support
[21:20] Fernandos: ah.. a wrapper ;)

[21:30] Fernandos: - I've to test this, but it appears that I can use nodejs inside of legacy systems written in php by using DNode to return results for the parsed xml sections for display. I am not sure if using a compiled php module is faster, but it's less complex in this case..hmm
[21:30] bosphorus has joined the channel
[21:32] Fernandos: - oh..I could use a non-relational db like mongodb or something as backend cache, or do I miss a key technique in nodejs? Is there a builting caching layer or db?
[21:32] Fernandos: - a key value store actually would be sufficient
[21:32] swaj: I would recommend redis -- lots of libs for it, and it's quite fast

[21:35] polotek: so it's odd that i"m still getting tripped up by this
[21:36] polotek: but if I have 2 modules that are siblings (in the same node_modules folder)
[21:36] polotek: they should be able to require each other right?
[21:36] isaacs: polotek: yes

[21:44] josh-k has joined the channel

[21:45] waterhead: is there a clean way of ensuring only one request (in this case, one web socket handler) can get into a given function at a time?
[21:45] isaacs: polotek: it realpaths
[21:46] isaacs: polotek: so, it's based on the node_modules paths from where the actual physical file is

(i do know things like fb api, javascript/coffeescript. etc. just been writing apps in rails before, now want to try node.js)

[22:14] bshumate: Nopik: these are good quality screencasts which might help you along: http://nodetuts.com/
[22:15] Nopik: yeah, been there briefly, learned how to get coffee script + nodemon ;)
[22:17] Nopik: i never used any nosql db, seems like they are very popular with node.js.. i can try something out there, why not ;) but i'd like something very lightweight to install and run. kind of sqlite, you know.. mongodb seem very popular, is it lightweight like this?
[22:17] Nopik: i.e. preferably just store db in 1 file, require no dedicated server process
[22:18] lkosak: exit
[22:18] lkosak: ugh.
[22:19] EhevuTov: Nopik, I'd suggest use Mongoose+MongoDB. MongoDB isn't hard and Mongoose will provide you something similar to what you're use to with AR

[22:25] jtgiri_ has joined the channel
[22:25] EhevuTov: I don't know your constraints, but I don't find it difficult
[22:26] Nopik: yeah, i figured it out.. just wanted something really lightweight for development, sqlite would be perfect.. i saw some sqlite drivers for node.js, but it seems that sql relational dbs are slightly not the 'node.js way' ;)
[22:27] EhevuTov: Nopik, not quite true, it's just that ORMs aren't that mature yet in node
[22:27] boltR has joined the channel
[22:27] Nopik: yeah, thats another thing ;) i hoped that i'll be able to quickly switch from rails, but more things are not as mature as i would like.. very promising, though
[22:28] pita has joined the channel
[22:28] EhevuTov: Nopik, I've had similar issues. That's why I suggested Mongoose
[22:28] pita: Is there a hack to access module variables that didn't get exported?
[22:28] asparagui has left the channel
[22:29] WarheadsSE: pita, wouldn't that negate the point of module variables staying private?

[22:30] SteveDekorte has joined the channel
[22:31] TheJH: pita, can you just paste a little piece of code into the module?

[22:31] uchuff has joined the channel
[22:31] TheJH: pita, bam, that's it
[22:33] TheJH: pita, if you aren't able to do that, you could consider monkeypatching require.extensions['.js'] to inject that stuff and attach that eval to exports or so
[22:33] Rushing: anyone know the docs url for the "n" module?
[22:34] Rushing: trying to figure out how to load a version with some build options (no ssl, specifically)
[22:34] pita: TheJH: cool, thats what I need, thx
[22:34] TheJH: Rushing, https://github.com/visionmedia/n
[22:34] TheJH: pita, be aware that eval makes your code slow
[22:34] Rushing: thanks TheJH
[22:34] TheJH: pita, even if you don't use it!
[22:35] TheJH: pita, afaik, the very presence of eval causes many optimizations to fail

[22:35] jakehow_ has joined the channel
[22:35] TheJH: but for stealing stuf from inner contexts, it's cool :)
[22:36] TheJH: pita, you can even give that eval wrapper to the repl core module and you should get a repl that's running inside the module :)
[22:36] TheJH: pita, actually, that's a cool idea...

[23:40] bnoordhuis: yes - both do actually

[23:46] quackslike: bnoordhuis: so would you recommend on over the other for any particular reason?
[23:46] quackslike: on = one
[23:46] mrtazz has joined the channel
[23:47] quackslike: Using the core module is there any benefit to using a number greater than the number of cpus (as it is shown in the docs) http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.6.3/api/cluster.html Or is that pointless?
[23:47] quackslike: my app will serve some files and i'm not sure if that means all other users will be blocked until the file is finished serving to the current client?

[23:48] quackslike: so i was thinking i'd run multiple instances to make it more likely one of the instances could handle the request.

[23:48] bnoordhuis: quackslike: depends - the core module is built-in and will be supported indefinitely
[23:49] dshaw_ has joined the channel
[23:49] bnoordhuis: tj's module is more advanced though, more customizable
[23:49] quackslike: bnoordhuis: yeah i was thinking i'd like to use the core module rather than a 3rd party one
[23:50] quackslike: i also noticed that tj's one doesn;t liek 0.6* as supported at this stage...
[23:50] pgte has joined the channel
[23:50] quackslike: *doesnt list 0.6 as supported..
[23:50] shripadk: quackslike, if you are talking about express it works on 0.6.. clone from github
[23:51] quackslike: shripadk: i'm talking about the Cluster module https://github.com/learnboost/cluster
[23:51] shripadk: ah ok :) joined the convo late!
[23:52] quackslike: shripadk: i'm using express from npm install with 0.6
[23:52] quackslike: seems ok.
[23:52] BinaryMuse has left the channel
[23:52] shripadk: it works for you? weird... i tried twice today! won't let me install. requires node v0.5.0 or less

[23:53] EhevuTov: shripadk, did you update your express module?
[23:54] quackslike: npm info express - says: engines: { node: '>= 0.4.1 < 0.7.0' },
[23:54] EhevuTov: yeah, I think the older version of express says something like '< 0.5.0' or something
[23:54] quackslike: and version: '2.5.1'
[23:54] shripadk: cool let me try :)
[23:55] shripadk: 2.3.11 says that i guess
[23:55] EhevuTov: yeah, just update your version of express and let us know if that solves it
[23:57] rektide: what am i supposed to do with a .node addon once i have it built?
[23:57] rektide: is there some way to install it?
[23:58] shripadk: just require it
[23:58] shripadk: EhevuTov, works :D
[23:58] EhevuTov: tizight. group hug
