[00:02] aaronblohowiak_: tjholowaychuk: how are you testing the full stack integration?
[00:03] tjholowaychuk: aaronblohowiak_: you would have to ask guillermo i dont work on socket.io

[00:03] aaronblohowiak_: tjholowaychuk: hmm, i would have thought that such testing was part of app development..
[00:03] aaronblohowiak_: i'll follow-up with g. thanks

[00:03] skm_ has joined the channel
[00:03] mscdex: mape: not that i'm aware of since ncurses listens on stdin for input
[00:03] tjholowaychuk: no clue what hes doing
[00:04] aaronblohowiak_: tjholowaychuk: cool, thanks.
[00:04] mape: mscdex: ah k, soo why doesn't the last app in the pipe chain get stdin from input?
[00:05] ashleydev has joined the channel
[00:05] mscdex: mape: i dunno, i guess since stdin is already open and being used, ncurses can't use it for input :S
[00:06] mape: curses!
[00:06] mscdex: mape: actually, it looks like you might be able to pipe into it
[00:06] mscdex: stackoverflow to the rescue!

[00:08] mape: mscdex: link?
[00:09] nlacasse: btw, lets move this conversation to #metrics, cuz daniel might have input

[00:09] mscdex: mape: to use a different fd

[00:28] Lorentz: Can anyone think of a reason why mongoose would tell me it's connected, but whenever I use a model to save or find, query doesn't go through to the server (I'm checking the logs)?
[00:29] Lorentz: Server works fine with the cli client
[00:30] joelklabo: hey tj, do i need to update express to use stylus middleware?
[00:30] Lorentz: node is 0.3.7, mongoose is 1.0.0, mongodb server is 1.6.5
[00:31] tjholowaychuk: joelklabo: should not have to no

[00:56] joelklabo: what is the "secret options string" for sessions()?
[00:57] mjr_: mnot: I've had this issue before on some computers.  In the end, the solution was to remove all traces of pcap and start over.

[01:01] pauls has joined the channel
[01:02] Lorentz: Goddamn, so mongoose connects to the mongodb fine (asking for ismaster and everything), but can't seem to send out any additional queries from find or save etc.
[01:03] tanepiper: if people don't use 'homepage' in the package.json, or 'web' under repo then i can check url - but then there is url in the root as some people use, but also url in the repo part, and in licence, and in bugs
[01:03] jonaslund: one thing i sorely lack that i think belongs in the core is some functionality to read/write out the bytes of a number
[01:03] tanepiper: parsing urls suck
[01:04] jonaslund: IE get the 8 bytes of a number into a buffer for writing.. you really can't do that in a stable way in JS
[01:05] daniellindsley has joined the channel
[01:06] jonaslund: right now you have to use math functions that aren't entirely accurate.. and it's overly complex compared to how it could be
[01:06] blueadept has joined the channel
[01:08] jonaslund: something along the line of java.lang.Double.doubleToRawLongBits(x) and java.lang.Double.longBitsToDouble(x)
[01:09] pgte has joined the channel
[01:09] jonaslund: granted there isn't any "long" so it'd either be dumping the bytes into an buffer (and what endianness?) or somehow just having a helper to decode the double.

[01:10] softdrink has joined the channel

[01:18] sentientwaffle has joined the channel
[01:18] mjr_: also add pcap.js:44 to print the three args passed to binding.open_live().  
[01:18] mjr_: Maybe there's something silly with my default_device or the filter || "".
[01:19] sentientwaffle: I am having an issue with node.js: after I clone from github and run ./configure, when i run "make" my computer works for a couple minutes then reboots (Ubuntu 10.04)
[01:19] mjr_: sentientwaffle: wow
[01:19] mnot: sentientwaffle: that's bad
[01:19] mjr_: That's a problem with more than just node
[01:19] jonaslund: haha yeah
[01:20] mnot: mjr_: I did "snprintf(errbuf, PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE, "pcap Open: got %d args, not 3", args.Length());"
[01:20] sentientwaffle: anyone know whats going on? I have installed node.js before...
[01:20] mnot: %d correc there?
[01:20] jonaslund: sentient: something is quite wrong with your computer, you're not overclocking or anything like that?
[01:20] mjr_: mnot: yeah, probably.
[01:20] mnot: cause I get "ypeError: pcap Open: got 1606412496 args, not 3"

[01:34] daniellindsley has joined the channel
[01:34] mnot: sounds like a hardware issue to me.
[01:34] ablo_afk: sentientwaffle: if it is rebooting, that means there is probably a heat issue or an irrecoverable  fault
[01:34] ablo_afk: follow ryah's advice and do it with gdb

[01:37] jonaslund: a computer that spontaneously reboots is not in a good shape. period
[01:37] sentientwaffle: Its not spontaneously, it happens at the same time in every "make"
[01:37] jonaslund: same thing
[01:37] sentientwaffle: ...
[01:38] jonaslund: your computer gets under load and either something overheats (and produces random results that creates a crash) or some part of your hardware goes nuts under load (disk?)
[01:38] jonaslund: my previous laptop used to overheat and reboot when playing games or viewing videos
[01:38] sentientwaffle: yesterday I compiled webkit without issue... thats an even larger project than node. why would it be different?
[01:39] lukegalea has joined the channel

[01:44] jonaslund: not counting a bunch of dead disks (and a bit of money spent on recovery firms)
[01:45] benjamin_s has joined the channel
[01:47] jonaslund: The memory chips was actually a faschinating one, i know the memchips were faulty since there was a motherboard replacement program for that laptop in question. I'm not 100% that this was the error but it vanished after i got a new motherboard
[01:47] bartt has joined the channel
[01:48] mikeal has joined the channel

[03:03] pauls: good luck finding a good wrapper/driver
[03:03] pauls: i noticed mongoose doesn't seem to do mapreduce yet
[03:03] mikeal: mongo mapreduce is kinda lame anyway
[03:03] mikeal: it's not incremental
[03:04] mikeal: so it's a table scan on every damn query
[03:04] pauls: :'( maybe i should try couchdb afterall. how does it manage object-object relationships?
[03:04] pauls: i noticed that's another big problem with mongo
[03:05] mikeal: it doesn't treat them as object to object, you create a normalized index using mapreduce
[03:05] mikeal: and mapreduce is incremental
[03:05] mikeal: the btree is cached on disc and updated on read
[03:06] lukegalea has joined the channel
[03:06] pauls: that's neat
[03:07] pauls: but do you have to write a lot of code to do maintenance on relationships? or is it fairly easy to add/remove objects to other objs by idx?

[04:08] JohnnyL: crodas: and a sql db can't do this?

[04:09] cronopio: JohnnyL: jejeje a SQL db can't scale xD
[04:09] JohnnyL: scale to what?
[04:10] jchris1 has joined the channel
[04:10] Aria: SQL's rather a lot of machinery for something that comes down to "store this" and "delete that"
[04:11] chapel: for sessions I would use redis
[04:11] chapel: since it is volatile data anyways
[04:11] cronopio: We prefer a no-sql db like mongoDB, are better in reading data operations
[04:11] Aria: Yeah.
[04:11] chapel: do you know what redis is?
[04:12] JohnnyL: that answers my question not.

[04:14] aurynn: SQL has its place, as do k/v stores
[04:14] Aria: There's nothing something speaking an SQL-like dialect couldn't do. But things that SQL databases tend to do -- like atomic, isolated commits -- are slow.

[04:15] gJ|Alex has joined the channel
[04:15] Aria: aurynn: Look for loops -- things that call itself, perhaps by emitting an event that it's responding to.
[04:16] aurynn: It also helps to look at the right section of the code. ><
[04:17] muk_mb: if you guys could answer my super-quick survey real quick, that'd be awesome: http://goodwinlabs.wufoo.com/forms/city-survey/ all it asks is what city you're in and wether you're contract/employed/indy
[04:17] chapel: redis is an in memory k/v store that is really fast
[04:18] chapel: and scaleable
[04:18] Lorentz: Which is better, redis or memcached
[04:18] chapel: redis
[04:18] Lorentz: Why?
[04:18] Aria: redis supports a nice suite of operations on its data. Things like increments, conditional stores.
[04:18] Lorentz: Assuming I want nothing more than straight up k/v store/retrieving.
[04:19] Aria: muk_mb: Which would "I run a company that creates products and consults" be?
[04:19] muk_mb: that you work for a company
[04:19] cronopio: chapel: redis sound nice!
[04:19] muk_mb: Aria: thanks for your time :)
[04:19] Aria: Sure. Nice simple survey.

[04:19] vipaca has joined the channel
[04:19] Lorentz: Done here as well
[04:20] Aria: Lorentz: Doesn't particularly matter -- heck, you could cobble together your own thing that's decent if that's ALL you need. But Redis is neat, and yet still simple.
[04:20] muk_mb: thanks Lorentz
[04:20] muk_mb: I'll be publishing the results if I get enough answers
[04:21] yozgrahame: iirc, redis is generally not recommended for persistent sources of truth
[04:21] Lorentz: Aria: Well, I didn't want to write my own, if there's something already out.
[04:21] yozgrahame: it's great as a fast caching layer, though
[04:21] KungFuHamster has left the channel
[04:21] yozgrahame: (amongst other uses)
[04:21] chapel: yozgrahame: for sessions it seems very pertinent
[04:22] Aria: Well, redis doesn't give any particularly strong recovery guarantees. But it's easy for it to sync its datastore often and you can always just keep copies of that.
[04:22] Aria: Then again, neither does memcache.
[04:22] chapel: I personally would use it as a buffer for writes and reads, which are then put on a regular db like couch that is more stable
[04:22] yozgrahame: chapel: agreed, especially once cluster comes out
[04:23] yozgrahame: though, SQL DBs are still a remarkably good option for most things
[04:23] Aria: I'm not entirely sure that's true.
[04:23] chapel: eh, mapreduce :P
[04:23] ryah: <3 sql
[04:23] chapel: couchdb just seems like the best solution imo
[04:23] chapel: when compared to sql
[04:23] yozgrahame: chapel: it depends entirely on your use case
[04:24] yozgrahame: and your data model
[04:24] chapel: sure
[04:24] yozgrahame: there is no one best DB.
[04:24] ryah: mysql
[04:24] ryah: definitely is the best db
[04:24] Lorentz: There is, it's called sqlite on a ramdisk.
[04:25] chapel: but sometimes your methods and data models can be skewed to one type of db which makes that db perform better (speed/whatever) where as remodelling your data can yield better or similar results in another type of db
[04:25] yozgrahame: ACTION starts quivering. "Nurse! I can hear them again! The database wars! THEY'RE COMING FOR MEEE…" and puts his bedpan on his head.
[04:25] Aria: Bah, ryah, real men write directly to the block device.
[04:25] chapel: http://blog.danielwellman.com/2008/10/real-life-tron-on-an-apple-iigs.html << :)
[04:25] ryah: i made a screencast
[04:26] ryah: but waiting for vimeo to encode it :/
[04:26] chapel: of what ryah ?
[04:26] Lorentz: chapel: Probably "mysql > *"
[04:27] yozgrahame: SQL gets a lot more appealing once you compare the ease of writing arbitrary SELECT queries to sending map-reduce functions over raw HTTP
[04:27] ryah: the new debugger
[04:27] chapel: yozgrahame: that is a mongo issue
[04:27] ryah: how long does it take usually? :/
[04:27] Aria: ACTION laughs. Sure, yozgrahame. Until you programmatically generate a self-join. 
[04:27] chapel: couchdb stores mapreduce functions and incrementally updates them
[04:27] ryah: waiting => anger
[04:27] yozgrahame: it's an issue with every NoSQL DB
[04:27] chapel: ryah: read my link
[04:28] chapel: that should cheer you up
[04:28] yozgrahame: Look, I'm not ragging on NoSQL - I really want to play with Redis and Riak when I have a project for them
[04:28] chapel: yozgrahame: no worries, but couchdb stores mapreduce results and so you call a view and dont have to send the function every time
[04:29] yozgrahame: but people seem to dramatically underrate the power, flexibility and maturity of the toolset you get with a SQL DB
[04:29] yozgrahame: chapel: RIght, but two problems with that
[04:29] chapel: idk, I don't like having a dynamic query every time I want to access data, seems counter intuitive
[04:29] yozgrahame: 1: It's no good for running arbitrary analysis queries, which you do all the time when trying to learn what's going on with your service
[04:30] yozgrahame: 2: It means that every new query generates a new index
[04:30] chapel: yozgrahame: you can do temporary views
[04:30] chapel: but I am talking about in production, where it matters
[04:30] chapel: in production, you should have your data massaged the way you want it already
[04:30] chapel: and that is where couchdb's mapreduce comes in
[04:31] yozgrahame: can couch's map-reduce be used for the equivalent of SQL UPDATE? (Genuine question, I have no idea)
[04:32] Fuld: New York is about going into a Duane Reade and having a conversation with the cashier about metaphysics and whether the universe is deterministic or stochastic.
[04:32] chapel: map reduce is purely views
[04:32] Fuld: Tweet of The Day :p
[04:32] chapel: for changing values in the store, that requires replacing the document (it is a document store)
[04:33] yozgrahame: yeah, that's what I thought
[04:33] chapel: couchdb's downfall is it isn't good for a lot of small incremental values
[04:33] chapel: unless you design towards that
[04:33] Aria: Yeah.
[04:33] yozgrahame: so, if you want to make substantial changes across your schema, that's a LOT of work
[04:33] vipaca has joined the channel
[04:33] yozgrahame: I mean, it sounds like more than it would be in SQL
[04:33] fission6 has joined the channel
[04:33] vipaca has joined the channel
[04:33] chapel: its a lot of work no matter the db
[04:33] fission6: i am getting the following Error: Uncaught, unspecified 'error' event.
[04:33] fission6: should i try and catch it in a block in my top most file
[04:33] noahcampbell has joined the channel
[04:34] chapel: but yozgrahame you could use a mapreduce view to collect the documents you want to change, and then change them
[04:34] yozgrahame: ok, that'd be good
[04:34] chapel: obviously that logic would be app side
[04:34] yozgrahame: right
[04:35] chapel: with couchdb btw, schemas aren't the same
[04:35] chapel: not like in a rdb
[04:35] chapel: every thing you write is a document
[04:35] chapel: it can have however much data you want
[04:35] yozgrahame: yes, I get that
[04:36] yozgrahame: right
[04:36] chapel: from one value, to well anything
[04:36] chapel: binary
[04:36] yozgrahame: and so that flexibility is very useful
[04:36] yozgrahame: except
[04:36] yozgrahame: if you have to plan it all out in advance, you lose a huge chunk of the advantages
[04:36] chapel: I dont see how, planning is important
[04:36] yozgrahame: right, but that's not what I'm saying
[04:37] fission6: Error: Uncaught, unspecified 'error' event. i put a try and catch around my code on the top level why isnt it catching Error: Uncaught, unspecified 'error' event. and letting execution continue
[04:37] chapel: running head first into a wall (db) and seeing if you hit the target isn't really a smart tactic imo
[04:37] yozgrahame: ok, let me clarify
[04:37] chapel: fission6: does it give a stack trace?
[04:37] yozgrahame: planning in advance is always worthwhile
[04:37] yozgrahame: however
[04:38] yozgrahame: a big chunk of the usefulness of DBs is how well they adapt to changes in the application
[04:38] fission6: chapel yes
[04:38] chapel: fission6: make a gist of it
[04:38] fission6: Error: Uncaught, unspecified 'error' event.     at Browser.emit (events.js:25:15) ...
[04:38] yozgrahame: one advantage of schema-free DBs is that you can throw a load of heterogenous data structures in
[04:38] yozgrahame: and still query across them all
[04:38] yozgrahame: to some extent
[04:39] unomi has joined the channel
[04:39] chapel: think of mapreduce like sql queries + application logic
[04:39] chapel: it can massage the data into whatever form you want
[04:39] fission6: chapel any ideas?
[04:39] chapel: from key: values
[04:39] chapel: to xml
[04:39] yozgrahame: no, I get that
[04:39] chapel: to html
[04:39] chapel: fission6: uhh, would need the full stack trace
[04:40] chapel: and dont paste it in here, use gist.github.com or something
[04:40] fission6: ok
[04:40] fission6: i would have though putting a try and catch around my top most code would have caught it, that why i am confused as to why my app terminated
[04:40] chapel: yozgrahame: I know what you mean, rdb with sql can shift pretty easily with a few queries, so on that end of things it could be simpler
[04:41] chapel: but I wouldn't trade the power of mapreduce and how couch handles them for a simpler ability to change how data is stored
[04:41] yozgrahame: it still comes down to the core question
[04:41] yozgrahame: what are the key attributes and functions you're looking for in the data store for your application?
[04:42] chapel: fission6: well from what I understand, because node uses lots of code behind the scenes, the try catch is only applying to the code you wrote, and the error is happening in another file
[04:42] chapel: yozgrahame: of course
[04:42] fission6: ok
[04:42] chapel: and I agree that not all db's work for everything
[04:42] fission6: thanks
[04:43] chapel: fission6: the stack trace should show a line where it originated in your apps code
[04:43] yozgrahame: What I see of couch has a lot of promise, but it's still lacking a lot of basic things
[04:43] chapel: like what yozgrahame ?
[04:43] fission6: right
[04:43] yozgrahame: it's still single-node, as far as I can tell
[04:43] yozgrahame: though most RDBMSes are master-slave
[04:43] chapel: there is bigcouch if you want a cluster style setup
[04:43] yozgrahame: so maybe that's fine
[04:43] chapel: couch itself is master <-> master
[04:43] yozgrahame: ah, not seen bigcouch
[04:43] yozgrahame: let me take a look
[04:44] chapel: www.cloudant.com if you want a hosting provider
[04:44] chapel: they made bigcouch
[04:44] chapel: also couch has lucene behind the scenes, so full text searching is possible
[04:44] yozgrahame: oooh
[04:44] yozgrahame: OK, this is much more appealing now
[04:45] chapel: I haven't messed with that part of it
[04:45] Yuffster_work has joined the channel
[04:45] sveimac has joined the channel
[04:45] yozgrahame: though having to create new map-reduce functions for every arbitrary analysis is still a turn-off
[04:45] yozgrahame: but, hey
[04:46] yozgrahame: maybe having a standard set that feed through to a SQL datawarehouse
[04:46] yozgrahame: I bet that'd help a lot
[04:46] chapel: have you messed with mapreduce?
[04:47] yozgrahame: not much, I confess
[04:47] chapel: it seems confounding at first
[04:47] chapel: but once you get a hang of it, its quite nice
[04:47] chapel: specially being js
[04:48] chapel: thats what I was saying earlier to mikeal, it would be nice if there was a mapreduce playground
[04:48] chapel: so people could see it used in real time
[04:48] pkrumins has joined the channel
[04:48] chapel: as far as how it works, examples, make their own
[04:48] chapel: you can goto couchone.com and sign up for a free couchdb
[04:50] yozgrahame: I'd be interested in seeing some speed comparisons with MySQL on similar queries & datasets
[04:50] aguynamedben has joined the channel
[04:51] chapel: well I would think that might be unfair
[04:51] chapel: not similar in scope
[04:51] chapel: being that mysql is dynamic
[04:51] chapel: and couchdb stores its indexes
[04:51] yozgrahame: what, you think couchdb would win?
[04:52] chapel: not saying that, just not exactly fair
[04:52] yozgrahame: in some queries, I'm sure it would
[04:52] yozgrahame: yeah
[04:52] yozgrahame: oh, I realise that
[04:52] chapel: there are more things to compare than speed
[04:52] yozgrahame: it'd just be interesting to see which DB wins where
[04:52] chapel: there are other things couchdb has that make me like it as well
[04:52] chapel: like couchapps
[04:53] chapel: and _changes
[04:53] yozgrahame: yeah, those two are fabulous
[04:54] jashkenas: are there any interesting production couchapps?
[04:55] chapel: umm let me look
[04:56] chapel: http://caolanmcmahon.com/ << that is a couchapp I believe
[04:56] ROBOTARMY has joined the channel
[04:56] yozgrahame: http://www.couchone.com/products - Mobile looks v intriguing, though I'm wondering what stopped them going for a pure client web app, rather than putting the sync logic on a local server, which is what they've done
[04:57] ryah: ACTION shakes vimeo
[04:58] wadey has joined the channel
[04:58] chapel: yozgrahame
[04:58] chapel: couchdb replicates using _changes
[04:58] yozgrahame: yeah
[04:58] chapel: and so having a local couchdb means they can easily keep up to date as needed
[04:59] chapel: all the logic is local to the client, and the data is only what is passed
[04:59] yozgrahame: right, but I thought someone had done an in-browser Couch
[04:59] yozgrahame: that's what I mean
[04:59] piscisaureus: wonders why youtube is no longer salonfähig
[04:59] chapel: in browser couch?
[04:59] yozgrahame: yeah
[04:59] yozgrahame: that can use localStorage
[05:00] chapel: well that isn't the same thing
[05:00] yozgrahame: let me clarify the question
[05:00] yozgrahame: CouchDB Mobile includes a mini HTTP server running on the device
[05:01] yozgrahame: that acts as a proxy between the HTML+JS UI and the remote CouchDB
[05:02] saschagehlich has joined the channel
[05:02] yozgrahame: what I'm wondering is: What's the HTTP server doing that can't be done purely in the browser JS? Assuming the Android browser supports things like offline apps and localStorage
[05:02] yozgrahame: I'm sure there are things, I'm just curious as to what they are
[05:03] chapel: it handles the application logic
[05:03] chapel: as far as what couchdb is doing for the couchapp
[05:03] yozgrahame: no, you misunderstand the question
[05:03] yozgrahame: or rather
[05:04] yozgrahame: I'm asking why the device-local CouchDB can't run entirely in the browser
[05:04] chapel: the whole point of using couchdb for a mobile couchapp is to leverage its strengths, instead of interfacing with local storage
[05:04] chapel: localstorage is an sql store
[05:04] yozgrahame: no it's not
[05:05] bradleymeck has joined the channel
[05:05] chapel: eh, I haven't used it, so I will not argue the point
[05:05] yozgrahame: you're getting confused with whatever that SQLite-in-the-browser proposal was.
[05:05] chapel: couchdb is more than documents
[05:05] yozgrahame: anyway, I think we've exhausted that topic now :)
[05:05] chapel: and it would be way too heavy to do mapreduce and all the other couchdb specific stuff in the browser
[05:07] Qbix1 has joined the channel
[05:09] jashkenas: (mapreduce is a silly notion unless there are multiple machines involved.)

[05:10] Aria: It /can/ be incremental.
[05:10] Aria: No need for it to be scary interruptive.
[05:10] chapel: uhh, jashkenas are you talking about mongo mapreduce or couch mapreduce?
[05:10] jashkenas: those are couch's b-trees...
[05:10] jashkenas: I'm talking about mapreduce the pattern.

[05:34] sh1mmer: if anyone builds salesforce with node
[05:34] Fuld: yozgrahame, integrates with their e-mail, phone, and text

[05:34] Fuld: It obviously won't have as many features starting off though, especially not in 7 weeks

[05:35] sh1mmer: micheil: yeah I know
[05:35] sh1mmer: I think I might txt him
[05:36] Fuld: It's a bit nuts choosing node.js for this because of the fewer libraries, but we're convinced it will be worth the invested time to create the modules where we can't find existing ones.
[05:36] Fuld: And hopefully, some of the modules will catch momentum and get forked by the community
[05:37] ryah: Fuld: sounds good :)
[05:37] ryah: websites should contirbute back to the tools they use

[05:42] jamescarr: Marak is never here
[05:42] warz: well cool man. hope all works out well.
[05:42] warz: id love to get paid to do something i enjoy. :P
[05:43] Fuld: JohnnyL, yeah. I've been having good success finding jobs in Manhattan that allow me to dictate the language, which means I get to use node.js :)
[05:43] warz: instead i get to write interop code for Office, in Delphi
[05:43] Fuld: Yeah, funded CRM start-up > unfunded zonechat unfortunately, but I'm definitely keeping zonechat going
[05:43] JohnnyL: Fuld:i had to turn it down because I live in Suffolk.
[05:43] Fuld: warz: meh
[05:43] JohnnyL: I thought nyc was pretty interesting though
[05:44] Fuld: JohnnyL: Dude why can't you move?
[05:44] mnot: mjr_: you still about?
[05:44] JohnnyL: fuld, i could, but it was a 3 week project.
[05:44] Lorentz: Nobody does nodejs in sydney.
[05:44] Lorentz: I feel so alone.
[05:44] JohnnyL: Fuld: i have another client in the works, but they are taking their sweet time.
[05:44] Fuld: ah
[05:44] warz: You have to make jobs for people there, then!
[05:45] JohnnyL: i already said I do django, and they are interested. Then I found out about Node.js
[05:45] mnot: I knew Sydney was uncivilised, but geez… ;)
[05:45] Fuld: warz: How much do you get an hour doing Delphi?
[05:45] Fuld: Delphi is oldschool pascal heh
[05:45] mjr_: mnot: just barely.  My computer beeped, so I'm typing for  a second, but I'm mostly taking care of my kids.
[05:45] mnot: understood
[05:45] ericnakagawa has joined the channel
[05:45] mnot: I've got it in gdb, but don't have any more clarity
[05:46] warz: fuld, i dont only do Delphi. its a 7 person shop, doing several million in year from 1 client. so, we do whatever they tell us, pretty much.
[05:46] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[05:46] warz: mostly Delphi and C#.
[05:46] Fuld: ah I see
[05:46] warz: but, I did get to use Django for a project there. that was about as close to what i enjoy as ive gotten.
[05:46] Lorentz: warz: I am planning that, actually
[05:46] Fuld: ACTION doesn't hate C#
[05:46] mjr_: mnot: that sucks.  Can you try just whipping up a purely static version of the call to binding.open_live()?
[05:46] Lorentz: A friend of mine's really into making games, and I'm working on a game engine in nodejs.
[05:47] Fuld: It's just MS was late to the party with it
[05:47] Lorentz: It'll be awesome.
[05:47] mjr_: mnot: so there's no ambiguity about how its being called.
[05:47] Fuld: ssweet
[05:47] mnot: will see what I can do
[05:47] mnot: yup

[05:47] warz: Lorentz, nice. I took 2 years of game programming courses in college. Fun times.
[05:48] Lorentz: I have prior experience from highschool.
[05:48] brainproxy: using node-inspector together with Chrome, great stuff .. but
[05:48] warz: cool. i always used XNA in my free time, because C++ in school would ruin my fun, heh.
[05:48] brainproxy: what if I need to step through code that's been pulled in w/ an eval
[05:49] brainproxy: impossible?
[05:49] brainproxy: I don't see that code in the drop down list of scripts the debugger tool in Chrome "knows about"

[05:52] Fuld: Nothing like writing a linear equation grapher in C with Xlib to do your math homework :D
[05:52] warz: ah, fun. i won't lie. i was never very good at making games. haha
[05:52] Fuld: ACTION was a weird student.
[05:53] warz: well, i would have been good if i was more interested, i'm sure.
[05:53] warz: i took game programming because i enjoyed reverse engineering, asm and hacking diablo/starcraft so much.
[05:53] warz: and i thought game programming would be similar.
[05:53] warz: but, yea i hate match so it was painful.
[05:53] warz: math*
[05:54] Fuld: warz: You don't hate math.
[05:54] micheil: ryah: I've added you are sh1mmer as collaborators on votizen/node
[05:55] warz: fuld, i really do. haha
[05:55] micheil: Lorentz: where in sydney?
[05:55] Fuld: warz: I'm convinced you really don't, just that no one has found a way to get you passionate about it.
[05:55] micheil: I'm at the web directions office atm.
[05:56] warz: in school, i just felt like it was so futile. why not just let me look at the equations and make me solve cool shit using them
[05:56] Lorentz: micheil: Right now, somewhere in strathfield.
[05:56] micheil: mnot: also, we can tell you're a loyal melbournite.
[05:56] ryah: micheil: tell me when you want me to pull from you
[05:56] Fuld: Right, so it's more about the way they fed it to you.
[05:56] Lorentz: I assume you're, like most other companies, right in surry hills?
[05:56] micheil: ryah: it won't be for a fair while yet.
[05:57] mnot: micheil: It's been beaten into me
[05:57] micheil: ryah: mainly just so that if you get documentation bugs or things like that that they can be put across to votizen/node
[05:57] ryah: micheil: small steps are better
[05:57] micheil: ryah: well, I need to write a new doc parser first
[05:57] mnot: micheil: first time I went to SYD, I called my wife and mentioned what a nice place it was. She hung up on me.
[05:57] micheil: that's the blocking issue
[05:57] ryah: oh, okay
[05:58] Lorentz: mnot: Haha
[05:58] Lorentz: Well, I went to melbourne once, and the roads were really weird.
[05:58] mnot: Lorentz: if *that's* the best you can do… ;)
[05:58] micheil: Lorentz: for what it's worth, I'm possibly giving a node.js talk at the SydJS meetup on the 16th
[05:58] Lorentz: It's the best I can do because it's the only thing melbourne has; roads.
[05:58] Lorentz: I didn't see any houses, if that's what you're asking.
[05:59] micheil: Lorentz: sydjs.org
[05:59] ryah: ACTION kind of feels he should add a little preprocessing to node...
[05:59] micheil: erm
[05:59] micheil: sydjs.com
[05:59] ryah: would like s/assert()//
[05:59] micheil: ryah: preprocessing?
[05:59] micheil: so what would the use case be?
[06:00] mnot: mjr_: tried with static binding.open_live, same result.
[06:00] ryah: so i don't have to incure the extra instructions for if (something) { new Error("assert failed"); }
[06:00] ryah: in a normal build
[06:00] micheil: ah
[06:01] Lorentz: micheil: says guest list is closed D:
[06:01] micheil: fair point, but then source code numbers differ

[06:08] mjr_: And the old one was finding it
[06:08] mjr_: I mean, otherwise, WTF?
[06:08] mnot: I'll see if I can reproduce it on a clean box
[06:08] mjr_: Anyway, 2 args was the old way tha pcap.js did it
[06:09] mjr_: 3 args is the new way, once offline mode was added
[06:09] mnot: I was modifying pcap.js to write to the console, and my changes were showing up
[06:09] mjr_: Seems like you must have had some crusty old pcap.js somewhere
[06:09] mjr_: gah
[06:09] mnot: yeah
[06:09] mjr_: Well, I give up.
[06:09] mjr_: I'm glad you got it working.
[06:09] mnot: at this point, I'd like this to be my fault.
[06:09] mnot: thx for your help
[06:09] mnot: if I can reproduce, I'll file a bug (with npm, I think)

[06:18] mnot: hmm, ok
[06:18] mnot: I may have found an issue, but let me verify first
[06:19] isaacs: if you install compiled modules, they may need to be rebuild and/or reinstalled
[06:19] mnot: yup
[06:19] isaacs: eg, pcap, glob, etc.
[06:19] isaacs: since the ABI changes from 0.2 to 0.3
[06:19] mnot: what I'm seeing is a compiled module not working even after its recompiled, until npm is re-installed with the new node

[07:26] slickplaid: about 25-35 hours
[07:26] AAA_awright: slickplaid: I'm working on something much more general, but the idea is you would just define the semantics for what an event is, what a location is, what a user is, etc, and it can figure out everything on it's own

[09:00] SubStack: tanepiper: write dnode-php go go
[09:00] bingomanatee: all of a sudden my sudo sudon't  and all hell broke loose. 
[09:01] SubStack: do you mean express as in the web framework or express as in the adjective?

[09:01] tanepiper: SubStack: no. No thanks

[09:02] bingomanatee: We can talk around the MVC example - if you can extend it and make something interesting, say, a site that sells puppies and women.

[09:03] bingomanatee: So follow your impulse - I will be talking around the Noogle stack, so do what you want.

[09:05] tanepiper: All my MVC is going to be in the client side with ExtJS, so I just really need routes, but actually doing good MVC from scratch is hard :(
[09:06] SubStack: hah neat
[09:06] bingomanatee: I really don't have a metric for how far along the average participant is going to be - I know a lot of people from IRC are (or say they are) attending but a lot of people are coming in from the code so I am trying to prepare for a relatively green audience. 
[09:06] SubStack: oh I know
[09:06] SubStack: bwahahaha
[09:06] SubStack: I can pull out all the shots
[09:06] SubStack: first, we build a webapp
[09:06] SubStack: then, we add sessions
[09:06] SubStack: and I can talk about middleware
[09:07] bingomanatee: Might be fun creating apps that send files from one laptop to another. 
[09:07] SubStack: yep!
[09:07] SubStack: but so next I can add dnode
[09:07] bingomanatee: uh -- files that the host laptop WANTS to send !
[09:07] SubStack: eh?
[09:08] bingomanatee: To be clear - you aughtn't to be able to GET a file just by passing an absolute path as a param - stealing people's mail files on day one would create a bad impression on people.

[09:19] bingomanatee: Substack - this is kind of embarrasing bit I just obliterated my entire ubuntu laptop today so unless I get some free time I won't even have a machine with node in it. 
[09:19] bingomanatee: Just as well I guess - I can provide full time support to others. 
[09:19] SubStack: ok
[09:20] chapel: how hard is it to get node though?
[09:20] chapel: git clone git://github.com/ry/node
[09:20] chapel: ./configure && make && make install
[09:20] chapel: :)
[09:20] SubStack: setting up the ubuntu is the non-trivial part
[09:20] bingomanatee: yeah - I am jsut super stressed - I joint a project that is behind on its deadline to a pretty major client so I am so stressed I can barely think .
[09:21] SubStack: especially with all the toolchain and libs and that noise
[09:21] bingomanatee: I will try and set up my mac to dual boot Ubuntu tonight. 
[09:21] bingomanatee: Sleeps for P****ys. 
[09:21] SubStack: is the mac portable?
[09:22] bingomanatee: yup
[09:22] SubStack: node runs pretty well on macs from what I can gather
[09:23] bingomanatee: well maybe I'll hedge my bets and go that route.

[10:13] dachary: CrazyGoogle: do you have libev installed ?

[10:13] CrazyGoogle: dachary: i got it worked some time ago with 0.2.x version
[10:14] CrazyGoogle: tanepiper: cloud9ide segfault because o3 module what git provides is compiled against node v0.2.x V8 i think
[10:15] mfernest1 has joined the channel
[10:15] CrazyGoogle: tanepiper: so if you recompile o3 against 0.3.x node it should work
[10:15] Yasser: I want to get the domain name from STDIN and pass in to dns.resolve but it never works, instead if I pass the domain name like 'google.com' to the dns.rosolve method (without any STDIN) it works. What's the problem?

[11:26] dachary: caolanm: I was not sure about what I want. Now I am ;-) A test suite for code that runs in the browser must run in the browser because it's the real thing. If, in addition, it can run on node.js it saves the trouble of using a webbrowser. Writing a different test suite just for node.js would not be helpful to me.

[12:15] SubStack: but no more!
[12:15] guybrush: right!
[12:15] guybrush: awesome
[12:15] guybrush: mix uglifyjs in and its perfect
[12:15] SubStack: yep
[12:15] SubStack: and also doing the client-side requires the right way
[12:15] guybrush: yes!
[12:15] SubStack: bundling them all when the server spools up
[12:16] SubStack: as a middleware
[12:16] SubStack: not this xhr-multipart async loading bah
[12:16] guybrush: i bet this will become huge :D
[12:17] SubStack: I had to take an hour out of writing it to go write a decent directory walker though
[12:17] SubStack: nothing on npm or github worth using, sadly
[12:18] guybrush: i have currently a very big json with paths and provide/depends infos, i am using this json to load all my js and uglify it
[12:18] SubStack: I have a really long list of <script> tags
[12:18] guybrush: all the client-side libs are in one big git-repo (everything is a submodule) this is not cool
[12:18] SubStack: really annoying having to write it that way
[12:18] guybrush: since there is npm
[12:18] SubStack: plus I want module isoluation
[12:18] SubStack: node-style
[12:19] guybrush: well i load everything into 1 big string and uglify it :p so there is 1 <script>
[12:19] guybrush: but it is not perfect at all
[12:19] SubStack: yeah that's the idea behind browserify
[12:20] SubStack: this module is a long time coming
[12:22] guybrush: the same approach could be usefull for css
[12:22] guybrush: css-"libs" as npm-modules
[12:23] SubStack: sure
[12:23] guybrush: npm install jquery-ui

[12:23] SubStack: I was thinking about jquery
[12:23] SubStack: I'd like to var $ = require('jquery')

[12:32] SubStack: why does there need to be an organization to figure out how modules should work in javascript?
[12:33] kixxauth: so that modules work in javascript.
[12:34] kixxauth: god forbid that somebody else may have thought of something that you or I missed.
[12:35] kixxauth: (or anyone else implementing module tools)

[12:37] JimBastard: that ALMOST looks like it might work
[12:38] JimBastard: its pretty much the same, except you can specify a regex property
[12:38] JimBastard: that will override
[12:38] SubStack: neat
[12:39] JimBastard: does that service.json look sane to you?
[12:39] SubStack: sane enough
[12:39] JimBastard: i gotta fix the regex

[12:46] erwe: hello everybody
[12:47] erwe: how fast is node.js compared to apache+php? and how secure is it?
[12:47] wao: ouch
[12:47] SubStack: erwe: those two aren't especially verifiable metrics
[12:48] wao: right
[12:48] erwe: why?
[12:48] wao: erwe: nodejs is too slow, please don't use it
[12:48] SubStack: security depends on the program far more than the language
[12:48] SubStack: except for php
[12:49] kixxauth: SubStack: ++
[12:49] kixxauth: hahaha.
[12:49] DoNaLd`: wao: slow ? .. so you think, that php is sprinter ? :)
[12:49] SubStack: in fact the only reason I can imaging that someone would ask that question is if all they knew was php
[12:50] Lorentz: Eh, php isn't bad, as long as you're not writing from scratch.
[12:50] Lorentz: But zf, the almighty framework of php, is kinda a very slow and painful mistress.
[12:50] SubStack: and no disrespect to erwe, all the disrespect belongs to php
[12:50] SubStack: also *imagine
[12:51] erwe: well i actually hate php .. no problem.. but that's the standard out there
[12:51] SubStack: oh good
[12:51] SubStack: erwe++
[12:51] v8bot:  SubStack has given a beer to erwe. erwe now has 1 beers.
[12:51] SubStack: have a beer
[12:51] erwe: but now i'm starting a project from scratch
[12:51] erwe: so i was looking at some other technologies
[12:51] guybrush: erwe: node.js uses 1 single thread for every request, apache uses 1thread per request
[12:52] SubStack: erwe: perfect, check this out: http://expressjs.com/ 
[12:52] erwe: yeah i know
[12:52] erwe: i've seen that SubStack ... i just wanted to know the opinions from who really uses it :P
[12:52] erwe: ty anyway
[12:53] kixxauth: erwe: test, test, test
[12:53] ROBOd has joined the channel
[12:53] guybrush: using nodejs puts you into a world where everything is asnyc
[12:53] kixxauth: and go for it.
[12:53] erwe: and i love js so i thought.. why not node?
[12:53] SubStack: erwe: and node's big strength is that you can have thousands of concurrent clients hitting the same server at once
[12:54] SubStack: so long as the server is mostly doing io bound tasks it works great
[12:54] erwe: that's exactly why i was looking at it
[12:54] kawaz_air has joined the channel
[12:54] Lorentz: Of course, you need to learn to write in async
[12:54] SubStack: if you have cpu-bound tasks it is maybe not such a great fit without some extra glue and concurrency pool magic
[12:55] SubStack: but little of web development is cpu-bound
[12:55] erwe: i need to handle the biggest number of users with the cheapest hardware possible lol
[12:55] Lorentz: Depends on what kind of users and what they're doing.
[12:55] Lorentz: This is all just up in the air as it is.
[12:55] kixxauth: SubStack: so what I don't get is where the performance gain comes from running multiple node instances given the event loop.
[12:56] kixxauth: after 3 or 4 is there anything left to gain?
[12:56] erwe: have you got some nice docs or should i look at expressjs one?
[12:57] guybrush: the idea of using multiple node-processes is, to outsource compute-intense stuff
[12:57] guybrush: one might want to use multiple node-processes for compute-intense tasks
[12:57] kixxauth: so it's getting the OS to use multiple cores?
[12:57] xmilliard has joined the channel
[12:57] kixxauth: is that the idea?
[12:57] guybrush: yes for instance
[12:58] guybrush: its like webworkers in the browser-world

[12:59] kixxauth: i just don't see how, after you have 1 process per core running, you're going to do any better.
[13:01] tanepiper: Well you could use something like ZMQ to pass messages from a core server to say a Math node instance running on another processor that runs CPU intensive tasks
[13:01] SubStack: ACTION should probably sleep
[13:01] kixxauth: tanepiper: Now you're talking all that Elang stuff... which is just too cool.
[13:01] dgathright_ has joined the channel
[13:02] guybrush: hm i dont know, i was not in the need of using multiple node-processes yet (and will not be in the near future :p)
[13:02] kixxauth: * Erlang
[13:02] erwe: is expressjs a mature framework?
[13:02] tanepiper: when there is a GPU module for node, that'll just be scary :D
[13:02] guybrush: erwe: it is very popular
[13:02] tanepiper: icanhaz megamath
[13:02] FND has left the channel
[13:03] Lorentz: Hmm, something leaning against CUDA and/or OpenCl
[13:03] kixxauth: erwe: mature might not be the best word, but it is the most robust.
[13:04] erwe: i mean.. can i use it for something pretty complex or is it just a cool project?
[13:04] tanepiper: nothing in node is "mature" yet, your looking at a ~2009 project that's picked up most traction in the last 6 months and we're only just about to land 0.4
[13:04] Lorentz: It can be as complex as you want
[13:04] tanepiper: but there is plenty stable, usable stuff
[13:04] Lorentz: I mean, nothing stops you writing more and more and more code
[13:05] Lorentz: tanepiper: What in node would use GPGPU's strengths though?
[13:06] guybrush: erwe: it provides common needed tools, like routing, parameter-handling, view-rendering, templates-support, sessions, errorhandling, ..
[13:06] tanepiper: Lorentz: dunno, distributed math stuff?
[13:06] guybrush: erwe: so if you need that in your very complex project i think it is pretty usefull

[13:59] bradleymeck: no, but sometimes i want info from the conf
[13:59] bradleymeck: like debug level
[14:00] tanepiper: ahh, gotcha

[14:49] Lorentz: Every machine I've ever seen, well, excluding some like the lisp machine (which may just have used C anyway), had C support.
[14:50] jonaslund: the biggest problem with JS is the old crappy implementations :(
[14:50] nonnikcam has joined the channel
[14:50] Lorentz: Not saying it's a good language for everything, but it's already pretty much dominated everything.
[14:50] Evet: indeed
[14:50] jonaslund: lorentz: if you buy a windows machine there isn't a C compiler on it, however the browsers on it will have an JS interpreter
[14:50] tanepiper: even if they are crappy :p
[14:51] jonaslund: lorentz: ofcos most of windows is build in C/C++ but the language itself isn't available on the machine
[14:51] tanepiper: I really wish MS would give up on their own browser and just use webkit
[14:51] jonaslund: same thing with your phone,etc..

[15:01] devdazed has joined the channel

[15:12] jezuz: well since it does I/O it would naturally seem like a pretty tough task

[15:12] jonaslund: the problem for me is that there seems to be some weird problem even installing cygwin on my machine (win7hp64bit)
[15:13] jezuz: may as well just use a vm

[16:32] torvalamo has joined the channel
[16:33] jonaslund: sholmes: that would entirely depend on how the payment provider handles things, but afaik many providers just do some kind of redirects or notifications after completion so it's usually a matter of having a web-server up. the tricky part would probably be to implement their api correctly
[16:33] mraleph: sholmes: I heard that even turing machine can do that.

[16:35] sholmes: I think the truth of the fact is that I'd need to write the API, but I guess I'm asking is there already API out there for autorize.net or an equivalent payment gateway service?

[19:01] Gruni: So that we can keep playful and use something else for preserved?
[19:01] ryah: mikeal: not yet
[19:02] ryah: mikeal: let me look at it. if i agree then i'd ask you to write a test case.
[19:02] ryah: and docs
[19:02] Gruni: playful because we love to write articles about games, test games, play games... and we love to prepare information for others.
[19:02] Gruni: and preserved / canned was just because we accidentally got the name "gameJars" :D
[19:02] ncb000gt: mxp: it looks like you're making a get request...the server wouldn't listen for body data since it's a get
[19:02] ncb000gt: mxp: try a post

[19:06] mxp: ncb000gt, seems like some extra characters picked :S

[19:06] mxp: any ideas?
[19:06] Gruni: And punch it together with "playful" to point out that we do it with playful ease.

[19:09] ncb000gt: mxp: seems like the ruby side is expecting a few more or less characters (depending on how your printout works)

[19:28] mikeal: ryah: i don't think my email is getting my use case across
[19:28] mikeal: so, the return value of require('request')({url:'http://www.google.com'})
[19:28] mikeal: is an instance of this object called Request
[19:28] mikeal: which is a stream
[19:28] mikeal: as a writable stream, it will write to the body of a client request
[19:29] mikeal: as a readable stream it emits data events from the response
[19:29] mikeal: if you don't pipe a body to it
[19:29] mikeal: it still need to finish out the request
[19:29] mikeal: because that just means the request doesn't have a body, which is most requests
[19:29] mikeal: that's why it needs to know if it's getting piped to
[19:30] ryah: pipe will call end
[19:31] mikeal: dude
[19:31] mikeal: there isn't a pipe
[19:31] mikeal: most of the time
[19:31] boaz has joined the channel
[19:31] mikeal: the notification is more for me to know when there wasn't a pipe
[19:31] mikeal: rather than when there is
[19:31] ryah: hm
[19:32] ryah: you want it so people don't have to call end() ?
[19:32] mikeal: they don't currently in request
[19:32] mikeal: like, every GET call you ever do, you shouldn't need to be calling .end()
[19:33] ryah: why not have two methods - one where the request is ended immediately and another where you have to end it.
[19:33] davglass has joined the channel
[19:33] mikeal: the whole point of this api, is to reduce the amount of calls someone needs to think about
[19:33] ryah: require('request/get')({url: 'foo'})
[19:33] mikeal: if they want to do all this shit manually they can just use the stdlib http directly
[19:34] mikeal: the way people do this in the old request api
[19:34] orospakr: Hey, is it possible to force node's HTTP server to answer with HTTP 1.0?
[19:34] mikeal: is they have to pass in options as requestBodyStream and responseBodyStream
[19:34] mikeal: but that sucks, and it's ugly
[19:34] ryah: orospakr: no

[19:38] mikeal: well you have two choices
[19:38] mikeal: either enable people to add more functionality than you wrote, in their own streams on top of the same api
[19:39] mikeal: and maintain compatibility 
[19:39] ryah: where magic is a subjective term i use to describe cute APIs :)
[19:39] mikeal: or incentivize people not to use streams

[19:39] mikeal: i'm all about keeping magic out of core

[19:40] ryah: what would unix do?
[19:40] mikeal: i won't use it
[19:40] mikeal: but at least they didn't run off to do their own thing that isn't compatible

[19:41] mikeal: part of the point of this new api in request is to encourage people to write everythign as a stream

[19:47] petepy has joined the channel

[19:48] mikeal: var self = this; req.once('pipe', function (src) {this.piped = src});

[19:49] javajunky: CrazyGoogle: really ? Its fairly popular amongst those who test :)

[20:05] tjholowaychuk: mikeal: not so true though about the template engine thing though :p I'd have to disagree on that one
[20:06] tjholowaychuk: I challenge you to write something like Stylus
[20:06] mikeal: template engines are easy to write, you just have a ton of bugs
[20:06] tjholowaychuk: granted some are very simple
[20:06] tanepiper: connect could definetly be a community effort
[20:06] mikeal: solving all the crazy edge cases are what take up all the effort
[20:06] kevwil has left the channel
[20:06] mikeal: but if you're the only person using it you won't notice most of the time
[20:06] mikeal: look at mustache
[20:06] mikeal: it's REALLY simple and has hardly any features
[20:06] mikeal: still taking patches
[20:06] mikeal: edge cases man :)
[20:07] tjholowaychuk: yeah im just saying, you cant call Stylus easy lol
[20:07] tjholowaychuk: it's decently complex
[20:07] isaacs: you know what's a great template engine and handles all the edge cases?  html.
[20:07] mikeal: i didn't even really consider style a template system for some reason
[20:07] mikeal: because it's so specific to css
[20:07] dude has joined the channel
[20:07] mikeal: it's not like you have syntax for outputing arbitrary shit, you actually understand css and your DSL and you have to map between
[20:08] mikeal: that's a lot more semantics than something like mustache
[20:08] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[20:08] javajunky: isaacs: surely thats the browser handling the edge cases ? :) 
[20:08] mikeal: isaacs: jsdom says otherwise :)
[20:08] mikeal: i did give up on markdown tho
[20:08] mikeal: and i just write everything as raw html
[20:08] mikeal: it's more typing but far less annoying 
[20:09] javajunky: hmm upgrading to 0.3.8 was surprisingly easy,  has it been made backwards compatible ? (I expected pain due to oauth being fairly http centric ?

[20:11] piscisaureus: ACTION sneaks in
[20:11] tjholowaychuk: mikeal: I guess my point is dont bash other people's work
[20:11] javajunky: tim_smart:  I was hoping to upgrade as-is for compatibility then release a breaking version (the client api is leaked with node-oauth at least)
[20:11] ryah: niklasfi: req.connection.on('close')
[20:11] isaacs: mikeal: i like markdown. not for structure, but for content, it's a really nice editing env.
[20:12] niklasfi: ryah: isn't that when the request terminates... i am thinking of downloads. so what if the client terminates the download... would that be res.on('close' ?
[20:12] isaacs: mikeal: it's easy to type and vim groks it well.
[20:12] isaacs: not as well as textmate, sadly

[20:13] narph: guys - if I install npm into a custom path that is not in $PATH, the bin/npm script does not find node (of course). is there any install option to fix this?
[20:13] isaacs: narph: you mean you installed node into a custom path?
[20:14] narph: same goes for /foo/bin/node /foo/bin/npm install bar - which fails because 'node-waf' is not found (understandable too)
[20:14] narph: isaacs: y
[20:14] isaacs: narph: add /foo/bin to your PATH
[20:14] isaacs: PATH=/foo/bin npm install bar
[20:14] narph: bah :/
[20:14] isaacs: it doens't have to be permanent, but it is a requirement.
[20:15] narph: hmm I understand
[20:15] isaacs: npm respects the PATH environ to play nice with stuff like nave/nvm/neco/n
[20:15] isaacs: (srsly, we should probably merge those into one project...)
[20:16] narph: probably
[20:16] tanepiper: isaacs: agreed, python on has one virtualenv and it works really well, so should we :D
[20:16] isaacs: the problem is that they were all written by the most opinionated people in the node community.
[20:16] isaacs: good luck getting us to all agree on something so trivial.

[20:57] mrkurt: my node_path is blank, tho
[20:57] mrkurt: so maybe I'll try it!
[20:57] isaacs: mrkurt: looks like nodeunit doesn't define a "main" module.  go post a bug for caolanm on http://github.com/caolan/nodeunit/issues
[20:58] mrkurt: oh
[20:58] mrkurt: ok then!
[20:58] olauzon has joined the channel
[20:58] isaacs: still, it has lib/nodeunit.js, which should be picked up in current npm/node
[20:58] isaacs: mrkurt: if you do require("nodeunit/nodeunit") does that work?
[20:58] isaacs: mrkurt: if so, `npm install npm` to upgrade
[20:58] mrkurt: yup
[20:58] isaacs: there ya go
[20:59] mrkurt: oh you rule
[20:59] mrkurt: thanks
[20:59] isaacs: still go post that issue, though.  nodeunit needs to define a main module in the package.json, and/or put an index.js in the root of the package.
[20:59] isaacs: otherwise it will break eventually
[20:59] mrkurt: it actually doesn't work even after npm install npm
[20:59] vz has joined the channel
[20:59] isaacs: mrkurt: you'll have to re-install nodeunit

[21:08] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: you wanna make the VirtualEnv for node?
[21:08] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: nope
[21:08] adulteratedjedi: nurb: thats a bit vague
[21:09] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: "I will probably work on this stuff tonight" makes me curious and excited.
[21:09] isaacs: :)
[21:09] tjholowaychuk: oh haha I just meant the updating to 0.3.x
[21:09] isaacs: hahah
[21:09] isaacs: context fail, sorry
[21:09] tjholowaychuk: :D
[21:09] isaacs: yeah, we should probably have a bit of a mind-meld on n/nave/nvm/neco
[21:09] isaacs: it's annoying to have to type them all out every time

[21:10] ncb000gt: tanepiper: put on pants...
[21:10] nurb: sorry, i have the /node directory with all modules and the compiled binary of 0.3.3, no .git inited in that dir - what now? I want to overwrite the old version..
[21:10] adulteratedjedi: ACTION would like something like bundler
[21:11] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: pretty basic stuff.  pip is sectioned off into the sub env.  you can snapshot your pip installs into a dependencies file or whatever.  you can name envs, and then have different stuff in each one.
[21:11] tanepiper: tjholowaychuk: virtualenv is awesome, self contained bin + libs that don't polute the system, node could really use that!
[21:11] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: but it doesn't do the rvm version management, i don't think
[21:11] tanepiper: yea, and the snapshots rock isaacs 
[21:11] tjholowaychuk: hmm
[21:11] tanepiper: pip freeze ftw
[21:12] nonnikcam has joined the channel
[21:12] isaacs: nave+npm is pretty close to virtualenv, but it lacks named-env support (mostly there, just not quite working) and a few other things.
[21:12] ncb000gt: pip freeze is pip though, separate tool from virtualenv
[21:12] tjholowaychuk: well personally only need that for the node bins really since all my libs are "vendorized"
[21:12] isaacs: no freezing
[21:12] andrzejsliwa has joined the channel
[21:12] nurb: sorry for my newbness but what now? get the new files from git somehow and overwrite the old ones then build again?
[21:12] isaacs: and the post 0.5 npm will do most of what virtualenv does, because each project folder will have its own segregated modules.
[21:12] tanepiper: ncb000gt: yea, but it works really well with virtualenv
[21:13] liar has joined the channel
[21:13] ncb000gt: tanepiper: no, virtualenv works really well at sandboxing
[21:13] mnot has joined the channel
[21:13] tanepiper: like the two were designed to work togther in harmony
[21:13] ncb000gt: pip just works with whatever your system context is
[21:13] isaacs: ncb000gt: you can basically view pip+virtualenv as a single tool.  they were designed to complement each other.
[21:13] ncb000gt: isaacs: true, but they are two sep tools which is why i view them that way, not everyone uses pip for libs
[21:14] ncb000gt: for whatever crazy reason
[21:14] ncb000gt: pip rocks

[21:14] svenlito has joined the channel
[21:14] nurb: hrmff
[21:15] ncb000gt: nurb: you can get the files off github and recompile that way
[21:15] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: i think once npm does the local-install stuff, we might actually not need anything as fancy as virtualenv.
[21:15] abraham has joined the channel
[21:15] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: yeah sounds like it
[21:15] isaacs: since each project will be its own word
[21:15] ncb000gt: then just make sure to recompile the binary libs
[21:15] isaacs: *world
[21:15] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[21:15] nurb: ncb000gt: do modules compile to the binary?
[21:15] ncb000gt: isaacs: local install with respect to your current directory?
[21:16] isaacs: ncb000gt: it'll walk up to look for either a package.json or a node_modules folder, or use the cwd if you have "global" explicitly set to false.
[21:16] nurb: ncb000gt: or better phrased - are modules compiled as well?
[21:16] ncb000gt: nurb: modules can be in c/c++ land
[21:16] ncb000gt: those would be compiled down
[21:17] markwubben has joined the channel
[21:17] nurb: ncb000gt: i mean modules like http and https for example
[21:17] ncb000gt: you'd want to make sure those are recompiled if you're rebuilding node from source
[21:17] ncb000gt: nurb: those are in node and thus compiled down within the binary
[21:17] ncb000gt: within node meaning part of core
[21:18] nurb: ncb000gt: if so why do i need to require('http') if its already compiled..

[21:30] ncb000gt: it's an option for gzipping in connect which is why i asked
[21:30] ncb000gt: nurb: I can't remember if you'll have to use --prefix for specifying the location
[21:31] ncb000gt: but i tend to just install node to the default, haven't gotten into nave/nvm/n/etc yet
[21:32] nurb: ncb000gt: so if i install to the 'default' which version will be 'running' ?
[21:32] ncb000gt: nurb: depends on which is hit first in your $PATH
[21:32] ncb000gt: i'd recommend removing one of the installs (at least from your path)
[21:33] ncb000gt: you might be able to download the binaries and just replace the old ones tho

[22:05] dachary: Hi, I'm using fs.readFile(filename, [encoding], [callback]). And I would like to run code that depends on the completion of the function. Is there a way to "wait" for it ? 
[22:06] isaacs: inorite = "I know, right?
[22:06] tanepiper: ahh :D
[22:06] isaacs: as in, "Yes, good sir!  I *do* agree with you, to such a degree that I must exclaim exasperation!"

[22:07] isaacs: "Indeed, it is as if I could not have said it better, were I to myself!"
[22:07] TheJH: @dachary: put your code in the callback or use a library like "async"

[22:09] TheJH: isaacs: when I join a channel, one of the first things I do is sending "help" to all bots I can see
[22:09] adulteratedjedi: isaacs: I concur, and as such inorite is not english as it is not documented in the english dictionary ;-)
[22:09] isaacs: TheJH: then this room probably took you a while the first time you joined :)
[22:10] isaacs: adulteratedjedi: what language is "urban dictionary" in?  what language are we speaking?
[22:10] TheJH: isaacs: no, it's the only one I immediately knew of that it's a bot
[22:10] isaacs: if this isn't "english", then i think maybe your definition of "english" is  useless.
[22:10] isaacs: (at least, wrt languages)
[22:10] ncb000gt: tanepiper: inorite is usually used sarcasticly though.
[22:10] TheJH: isaacs: actually, this is the first time I joined here
[22:10] adulteratedjedi: that is just splitting hairs
[22:10] stride: orly?
[22:11] ncb000gt: nowai
[22:11] isaacs: adulteratedjedi: if we're not arguing semantics, then all that's left is syntax.  and we've seen what happens when we start arguing syntax.  no good can come of that.
[22:12] stride: how's a 100+ posts thread on the mailing list that leads nowhere no good? :)
[22:12] jesusabdullah: inorite is totally English
[22:12] isaacs: TheJH: i've known v8bot for a long time, before the "git" thing was added, i believe.
[22:12] jesusabdullah: languages aren't ruled by old dudes with top hats and monocles
[22:12] isaacs: jesusabdullah: INORITE!?
[22:12] jesusabdullah: INOE!
[22:12] ncb000gt: inorite is headed for Websters...
[22:12] isaacs: it's a concept that it makes sense to have a single word for.
[22:13] jesusabdullah: The best OED, etc. can do is try to keep up :)
[22:13] adulteratedjedi: shall we just call it colloquial english then :-/

[22:13] isaacs: adulteratedjedi: colloquial means "as it is used".  what other kind of english is there?  archaic english?
[22:14] jesusabdullah: Well
[22:14] DoNaLd`: s/by/be
[22:14] jesusabdullah: There IS a subset of English that is agreed on by some old dudes with top hats
[22:14] isaacs: literally, colloquial means "as used in conversation"
[22:14] jesusabdullah: I'll give him that
[22:14] isaacs: the other kind of english would be english that isn't used for communication?
[22:15] ncb000gt: DoNaLd`: how are you using it? that example works for me
[22:15] isaacs: surely, it makes sense to have technical terms and forms in certain situations, of course.
[22:15] adulteratedjedi: colloquial is conversational/informal english, so the other kind of english is formal, or correct ;-)

[23:52] booths: Potentially idiotic question: If I don't use a callback, ie, I provide it, but then just don't callback, does that leak?
[23:52] booths: From what I can tell looping a ton it builds memory, but no more than building an array with a ton of strings
[23:52] norviller has joined the channel
[23:53] ncb000gt: booths: the callback would take up memory

[23:53] abraham has joined the channel
[23:53] booths: ncb000gt: Would it leak, and if so, at what time in normal usage is it released.
[23:54] ncb000gt: booths: shouldn't leak if the objects you're using are no longer used they would be collected
[23:54] jashkenas has joined the channel
[23:54] ncb000gt: but if there are still references around then it could stay around in memory
[23:56] booths: Hmm, alright... I'll have to see. I mean, I'd think after the function returns any references it held would be released, including the callback, would be released if it didn't send a callback itself.

[23:57] booths: Cygwin makes it difficult to tell if something's leaky, or just cygwin being a pos. It takes up like 270mb of memory just to run node and dump the memoryusage
[23:57] ncb000gt: booths: are you talking about it wrt an event emitter?
[23:57] isaacs: ircretary: tell janmonschke You need to use fs.symlink/fs.symlinkSync to create a symbolic link.  fs.link is for hard links, which cannot cross filesystem boundaries.
[23:57] ircretary: isaacs: I'll be sure to tell janmonschke
[23:57] ncb000gt: booths: ouch, linux ftw
[23:57] ncb000gt: :)
[23:58] booths: well I parse xml, and that has a callback, as well as sql calls
[23:59] booths: The flow is like this listener is hit with an xml packet (function provides a callback) -> sent to be parsed (provides a callback) -> extracts data etc etc and fires parser callback -> parser callback inserts data into sql (callback provided) -> callback for sql fired and data updated then the main callback is fired
[23:59] booths: So, say for example, there's a problem with the XML packet and I can't parse it, the main callback is never fired.
