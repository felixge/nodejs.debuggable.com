[00:00] tjholowaychuk: i would just do (string of js -> string of instrumented js) -> (other module decides to execute with vm module, browser, etc)
[00:00] tjholowaychuk: -> browser or mod passes $cov global
[00:00] tjholowaychuk: to stats() or something, and it computes data like ".loc .sloc" etc
[00:01] chrisdickinson: hm.

[00:01] chrisdickinson: bunker does exactly that, though.
[00:02] tjholowaychuk: you could build it with bunker
[00:02] tjholowaychuk: but it's still not the same thing
[00:02] tjholowaychuk: it's just a weird api on top of uglify's ast
[00:02] tjholowaychuk: to do arbitrary things
[00:02] chrisdickinson: b = bunker(src); str = b.compile();

[00:03] tjholowaychuk: or maybe that's burrito :s
[00:03] tjholowaychuk: so many abstractions..
[00:03] chrisdickinson: so many nouns.
[00:04] chrisdickinson: i'm actually using bunker exactly as you describe in runforcover: https://github.com/chrisdickinson/node-runforcover/blob/master/index.js#L110
[00:04] chrisdickinson: i take a js string, compile it down to another js string, provide my own context, and run it
[00:05] tjholowaychuk: ah, well yeah if that's what it does then great

[00:05] DrMcKay: tjholowaychuk, chrisdickinson: profiller?
[00:05] tjholowaychuk: though i still wouldnt use it anyway
[00:06] tjholowaychuk: you dont need three deps to write a damn node visitor
[00:06] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: that's why i was adamant that the "context assignment" bit be separated from the "running it" bit
[00:06] chrisdickinson: DrMcKay: native js profiler and code coverage
[00:07] DrMcKay: chrisdickinson: native: in C or JS?
[00:07] chrisdickinson: DrMcKay: in js.
[00:07] chrisdickinson: the goal being to remove C from the equation entirely.
[00:07] tjholowaychuk: DrMcKay to get rid of jscoverage
[00:07] DrMcKay: chrisdickinson: definition of native changed soo much :D
[00:07] chrisdickinson: DrMcKay: haha :)
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: haha yeah "native" is pretty ambiguous
[00:08] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: granted, 3 deps is a lil' silly. but they're small and pretty tightly focused.
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: i dont get why you need ast -> thing that invokes one callback -> thing that kinda generates cov -> cov
[00:08] tjholowaychuk: haha
[00:09] tjholowaychuk: ast -> visitor that generates cov
[00:09] tjholowaychuk: very easy
[00:09] tjholowaychuk: visit(node)
[00:09] tjholowaychuk: recurse, and you're done
[00:09] chrisdickinson: ACTION shrugs
[00:10] chrisdickinson: it works, and it was a good excuse to play around with burrito and bunker.
[00:10] chrisdickinson: i'm pretty happy with burrito's api, even if it is wrapping a fairly trivial operation.

[00:13] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: no no, it's fine. i understand the distaste for dependency-propagation.
[00:13] tjholowaychuk: it would be _very_ handy to have that
[00:13] tjholowaychuk: maybe bring it up on the ML
[00:13] tjholowaychuk: I'd +1 it
[00:14] tjholowaychuk: we use it for transparent debugging stuff and assertions

[00:16] tjholowaychuk: it does suck though with how it is you just end up clobbering anything else that was defined

[00:32] DrMcKay: yes, I see
[00:32] DrMcKay: too bad docs don't mention anything about mode
[00:32] NHQ: if the mode is changed to '0777' I can write the file, if it is changed to '0644', I get a permission error
[00:32] NHQ: yeah
[00:33] DrMcKay: if it should be a int, or string, or something
[00:33] NHQ: and using any int 777, 0777 or 0644 gives me permission errors

[01:40] aah: but there doesn't need to be..  http://json.org/ shows this to be a valid string
[01:40] aah: it should be treating the parsing the \ into a \, dropping it into the output buffer, and moving on.

[03:00] nuck-mobile: Feedback loop? How do I manage that?
[03:01] nuck-mobile: What happens when I press that little button, and how do I hook it?

[03:33] Carter1: is the node.js community getting pretty big now?
[03:34] SubStack: it's this big: |-----------------------|
[03:34] Carter1: impressive
[03:34] Nuck: SubStack: That's bigger than your penis.
[03:34] Nuck: :B
[03:35] Nuck: Then again
[03:35] Nuck: If it were bigger than a community, I'd be alarmed.
[03:35] SubStack: flaps of meat and programming communities aren't very comparable
[03:36] Nuck: SubStack: Well, they both tend to be attached to guys.

[03:39] Carter1: do you guys have a minute, to give me some advice?
[03:40] AAA_awright: Carter1: Don't ask to ask, just ask
[03:41] Carter1: so, my friends and i are forming a nonprofit that will be based around a webservice that helps disaster suvivors, volunteers, nonprofits and govt agencies
[03:42] robotarmy has joined the channel
[03:42] Carter1: just wanted to see what features we want to provide would be best written in.  i know node.js is very good at handling certain types of workloads
[03:42] mrchess: how much traffic are you expecting?
[03:43] Carter1: well, our goal is to be the one site that people go to for missing person reports, submitting needs and finding them, amongst other things
[03:43] Carter1: right now, there is no site out there that does it
[03:43] Carter1: so whenever a disaster strikes it could get hammerd quite a bit
[03:44] mrchess: you can probably write a site like that in anything you want
[03:44] mrchess: node, ruby, php, whatever
[03:44] Carter1: i'm sure it could be written in ruby or php
[03:44] mrchess: it might even be easier to use wordpress if its mostly form submissions and if you want something quick
[03:44] Carter1: that doesn't mean thats the best langauge choices though
[03:45] mrchess: i dont think node would give you any edge over the other two
[03:45] Carter1: especially if you're a nonprofit, you want to use what little resources you have effectively, both ruby and php aren't resource frugal
[03:45] mrchess: but ruby and php frameworks are well documented and common, might be easier to find help
[03:46] daed: gotta admit, i'm a ruby guy :(
[03:46] daed: i want to get into node.js, hard to though
[03:46] Carter1: http://adrienolczak.eu/poster/relief1.org/index.html#
[03:46] Emmanuel`: daed: yeah but once you get started, it's super duper efficient
[03:46] Carter1: this is our first draft of a teaser site we are creating
[03:46] daed: efficient how?
[03:47] daed: is there a large library i'm missing?
[03:47] Emmanuel`: daed: efficient in term of development speed
[03:47] Emmanuel`: and final product quality
[03:47] Emmanuel`: and fun
[03:47] daed: that's how i feel about ruby as well
[03:47] Carter1: isn't node like an order of magnitiude faster
[03:47] mrchess: emmanuel: argubably that could be said about any language
[03:47] daed: i actually love writing jquery though too, i don't mind js as a language
[03:47] mrchess: :o
[03:48] daed: is jquery considered taboo by the node community? i mean it doesn't really apply server side
[03:48] daed: but still
[03:48] Emmanuel`: it's not taboo as far as I know
[03:48] daed: i've been lusting over coffeescript too
[03:48] daed: does coffeescript apply to node at all?
[03:48] mrchess: carter: no. not necessarily
[03:48] mrchess: daed: yes you can write your node apps in coffee
[03:48] Emmanuel`: yes, lots of node module uses coffeescript
[03:48] mrchess: coffee is just syntatic sugar
[03:48] daed: nice!
[03:48] daed: yeah
[03:49] daed: figured it would be fine
[03:49] daed: is there a standard library for node?
[03:49] Emmanuel`: mrchess: agree, but they are all good for different things
[03:49] Emmanuel`: some of them are good for nothing
[03:49] Emmanuel`: daed: the core :)
[03:49] daed: interesting
[03:49] Emmanuel`: you have a lot of method that are integrated in the core
[03:50] Carter1: mrchess: is it possible to scale node.js across multiple servers, datacenters and have it be fault tolerant?
[03:50] Emmanuel`: like http/socket handling
[03:50] daed: seems like node was built from the ground up with sockets in mind
[03:50] daed: ahhh
[03:50] Emmanuel`: daed: yes
[03:50] mrchess: carter: think about it this way. rails took twitter up to millions before they shifted
[03:50] daed: fault-tolerance.. how does node.js compare to erlang in that sense?
[03:50] daed: mrchess; and they're still rails on the frontend
[03:50] daed: rails is abstracted enough that you can swap out any layer at will
[03:50] Emmanuel`: it's all about the way you use/program it I think
[03:51] daed: or remove it entirely
[03:51] daed: one thing i've wondered.. how does node.js compared to the standard C/C++ epoll/etc style of sockets?
[03:51] Carter1: mrchess: that's true
[03:51] mrchess: personally i like node, but if i were starting a huge project i might consider rails just because rails developers are more accesible
[03:52] daed: node and rails are entirely different
[03:52] mike5w3c_ has joined the channel
[03:52] daed: node could easily serve a webservice called by a rails app
[03:52] daed: apples and oranges i'd say
[03:52] Emmanuel`: daed: from my point of view, it makes socket usage much easier
[03:52] Emmanuel`: and allow you to do cool stuff without caring much about the boring parts
[03:52] daed: node could even be a server for an asp.net app *shudder*
[03:53] Carter1: mrchess: what if you use express?
[03:53] oceanspray_: deoxxa: node.js socket standard is very much like epoll
[03:53] oceanspray_: dead*
[03:53] daed: very much like?
[03:53] daed: being javascript though, isn't there more overhead than straight epoll?
[03:53] daed: or are there advantages?
[03:54] Carter1: mrchess`: or geddy
[03:54] amerine has joined the channel
[03:54] mrchess`: i mean they are all really good
[03:54] mrchess`: its really hard to pick
[03:54] mrchess`: there is no clear winner
[03:55] mrchess`: if you have access to more rails developres, go rails
[03:55] Nexxy: when in doubt go with the one that has the coolest name and prettiest logo
[03:55] mrchess`: if you have access to js developres, go js
[03:55] mrchess`: if you are interested in node more than rails, go node
[03:55] mrchess`: regardless of what you pick you can definitely build your project on either platform
[03:55] Nexxy: the question is; will you regret it?
[03:55] smathy has joined the channel
[03:55] Nexxy: with ruby, the answer is yes.
[03:55] Carter1: would you regret using node?
[03:55] Nexxy: NEVER
[03:55] Carter1: lol
[03:56] mrchess`: thats opinionated imo
[03:56] mrchess`: :p
[03:56] Nexxy: yes
[03:56] Nexxy: it is
[03:56] mrchess`: haha
[03:56] Carter1: i love honesty
[03:56] Nexxy: rails is a pile
[03:56] Nexxy: people that have worked with it for years
[03:56] mrchess`: u'll run into rails problems but will you really achieve that intesity of traffic
[03:56] Nexxy: know that as fact
[03:56] daed: nexxy; :(
[03:56] daed: that's just mean.
[03:56] mrchess`: node.. might cripple you in terms of being able to find talent
[03:56] Carter1: aren't there a lot of JS developers out there?
[03:56] Nexxy: http://npmtop.nodejitsu.com/
[03:56] daed: i'm struggling to hire a sr. ruby/rails dev here
[03:57] mrchess`: right, but just because u do js doesnt mean you do node
[03:57] Nexxy: daed, take it as a sign
[03:57] Nexxy: and roll w/ node
[03:57] mrchess`: js can also be strictly server side
[03:57] daed: nexxy; there's no way in hell i could find a node dev here
[03:57] Carter1: so i could easily go with PHP, but that would lead to other issues
[03:57] Nexxy: daed, I think you forgot to add "with the amount of money I have"
[03:57] Nexxy: ;P
[03:57] Emmanuel`: daed: where are you ?
[03:57] mrchess`: on a tangent: does anyone using socket.io 0.7 run into (node) Hit max file limit. problems?
[03:58] daed: emmanuel; orlando
[03:58] daed: lack of talent down here
[03:58] daed: however
[03:58] daed: i have to displace the php retards.
[03:58] daed: rails > php-anything
[03:58] Nexxy: and you call me mean for saying rails is a pile
[03:58] Yoric has joined the channel
[03:58] daed: well yes, naturally :P
[03:58] daed: i still <3 javascript
[03:59] Nexxy: but php-fpm + nginx + apc
[03:59] daed: blegh
[03:59] Nexxy: > rails
[03:59] Carter1: mrchess`: i agree with you though, you're being practical, i'm wanting to be a dreamer
[03:59] daed: oh sure
[03:59] chjj: i think i would choose php over rails if i could use php whatever way i wanted to
[03:59] daed: combine 3 things and say it's better than rails alone
[03:59] Nexxy: lol
[03:59] Nexxy: and rails is what without ruby?
[03:59] daed: well that's 2 things
[03:59] mrchess`: carter: i feel like you want to hear node is the right choice. it's not like that
[03:59] Nexxy: and don't try to tell me you build rails apps w/o something like redis or memcached
[03:59] Nexxy: cuz I will LOL heartily
[04:00] oceanspray_: daed: sure there's overhead in sock.on('data') compared read(fd, buf, size), but not there's no overhead from the api, since the api is like epoll/poll/select
[04:00] daed: we actually have a giant stack
[04:00] Nexxy: I've heard that before
[04:00] daed: rails just does some of the organization/UI
[04:00] Nexxy: including SQLite in production, right?!
[04:00] Nexxy: ;P
[04:01] chjj: sqlite is pro, dont talk ill about sqlite!
[04:01] jerrysv: anyone? best of breed file-based datastore?
[04:01] Nexxy: chjj, I have 0 problem with sqlite

[04:02] Nexxy: no, you are the devil

[04:55] slickplaid: Yeah? 
[04:55] progrock: yup.. and I moved most of my personal servers to rackspace as well
[04:55] slickplaid: Yeah I think we're making the right choice with rackspace
[04:56] SubStack: a felixge appears!
[04:56] SubStack: slickplaid: talk to felixge about video as a service
[04:56] progrock: Amazon had issue after issue after issue... which got us very good at automating the deployment process, etc... but it was horendous
[04:56] progrock: slickplaid: what kinda of material you planning on hosting
[04:56] slickplaid: HD Video
[04:57] progrock: ie.. space/bandwidth intensive, cpu intensive.. memory intensive....
[04:57] SubStack: felixge is one of the transloadit folk
[04:57] slickplaid: space/bandwidth
[04:57] slickplaid: probably going to use transloadit for encoding
[04:57] progrock: Ok, well rackspace has faster disk speed (at least from out benchmarks) and gives you much more cpu power
[04:57] slickplaid: just looking at the first month having like 250gb of video (total, in and out) being like $600... more than half our budget lol
[04:58] progrock: I take it this is a relatively serious project?  Ie. your plannign to spend thousands a month on servers?
[04:58] progrock: hmmm
[04:58] slickplaid: but, i suppose once it's paid for and usage levels off, it'll even itself out
[04:58] slickplaid: (video is encoded, and on the CDN/CloudFiles)
[04:59] progrock: well, this ay or may not fit you needs (not sure what kind of sustained bandwidth you need).. but I really like my other vps provider, rapidzen.. tey provide  a2 mbps ine per a server (technically  faster if you dont abuse the servers)... flat rate, no over charges even possible
[04:59] slickplaid: This is all stuff I should be contacting transloadit directly about :D no need to pollute the node.js channel lol
[04:59] progrock: AND you can get serevrs for as low as ~$6 a month with the 2mbps bandwidth
[04:59] slickplaid: Well, I've worked with a friend who has a smaller video hosting site that has a 1gbps dedicated server
[05:00] progrock: in other words.. 20 smal VPSes may give you a ton of bandwidth, and can be very cheap
[05:00] slickplaid: and it works decently well, just balks at high traffic periods at times
[05:00] progrock: well, with enogh of them load balanced.. you may be abel to get a killre service for penies on the dollar in comparison
[05:01] slickplaid: yeah, true... just a lot of setup to get an army of servers together... half the reason the premium is paid for CDN
[05:01] slickplaid: all that work is done already
[05:01] felixge: SubStack: that wasn't me appearing, that was my laptop powering on in order to play music over the wireless to wake me up :)
[05:01] felixge: but now it's me
[05:01] SubStack: aha
[05:01] slickplaid: WoL as an alarm clock... neat idea
[05:02] progrock: slickplaid: littlevps.net  is also wned by the same guy as rapidxen (the guy runs his own irc servers for tech support.. realy nice guy, the owners irc nick is nenolod

[05:04] felixge: jerrysv: I wouldn't know
[05:04] slickplaid: felixge: Will do. 95% sure we'll be going with Transloadit. :)
[05:04] jerrysv: felixge: this isn't yours? https://github.com/felixge/node-dirty
[05:05] slickplaid: Just kinda looking at a user uploading a 1gb HD video, then it needing to be transcoded for 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p in several different formats to support html5 video and flash. Wondering exactly how much that final bandwidth number is going to be for $$
[05:05] felixge: jerrysv: it has my name on it, but I haven't done any work on it since Sep 2010 ... :)
[05:05] felixge: so you know as much about it as I do
[05:05] felixge: : )
[05:06] progrock: slickplaid: I'd sti check out rapidxen/littlevps.net... the minimal $6-$7 a month server is pretty damn powerful.. and they are as reliable as any VPS I;ve ever dealt with

[05:06] jerrysv: felixge: randomly accepting pull requests then? :)
[05:06] felixge: progrock: good luck trying to encode 1GB HD in 4 formats ... :)
[05:07] felixge: progrock: on a VPS
[05:07] jerrysv: i see, flushes on set, unless a flush is occurring
[05:07] slickplaid: felixge: Yeah... lol :(
[05:07] felixge: progrock: I mean if your users can wait ~4 hours for each upload, it may work ... :)
[05:07] niftylettuce: any tips for streaming mp3's through node to <audio> or jplayer?
[05:07] felixge: we encode exclusively on 8 core machines
[05:07] niftylettuce: I saw TooTallNate's icecast stream stuff, but I think that might be overkill
[05:07] niftylettuce: (not really our purpose)
[05:07] progrock: felixge: well my company has dedicated hardware at rackspace on top of the cloud ardware
[05:07] progrock: plus the cloud hardware has something liek 60+gb ram servers
[05:08] progrock: I think tey can hande it
[05:08] felixge: progrock: for $6-7 / month? :)
[05:08] progrock: but we dont toy with videos, lol... we're a fiannce company
[05:08] slickplaid: half tempted to just say HTML5 only for webm, flash fallback for everyone else with a big middle finger.
[05:08] progrock: felixge: .... please dont be retarded and think I was saying he could run his whole service on 1 machine liek that
[05:08] progrock: I was more recommending 50
[05:09] felixge: progrock: anyway, I agree that we charge more than our internal hardware costs ... we kind of have to as a business : ). But OTOH you don't have to write Software to support hundreds of formats and quirks you'll run into with video encoding 
[05:09] slickplaid: felixge +1
[05:09] progrock: felixge: where do you work?
[05:09] felixge: progrock: please don't suggest I might be retarted, I just woke up ... alright, but still :)
[05:09] felixge: progrock: transloadit.com
[05:10] slickplaid: eliminating the work for a small dev team on transcoding, uploading, etc is quite nice.
[05:10] felixge: slickplaid: about pricing: It will cost 4x the GB + the combined output size of all formats
[05:10] felixge: slickplaid: unless you use the outputs of each format as the input for the next step
[05:10] felixge: slickplaid: this will mean the encodings will have to happen one after another instead of parallel, but it'd be much cheaper
[05:10] felixge: slickplaid: either way, email us about a discount and we'll handle it :)
[05:11] slickplaid: felixge: sounds great, emailing now.
[05:11] progrock: heh, we biased I'm sure... and yeah... I'm not even gonna argue on this one.... I definitely dont give a shit... and video encoding is the last thing I care about
[05:11] progrock: well*
[05:12] felixge: ok, time for a shower / morning walk. back in a bit
[05:13] progrock: damn it, I need to write a legit point behavior for d3

[05:29] progrock: .. I wouldnt be surprised.....
[05:29] catb0t: SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
[05:30] Nuck: progrock: Seriously, everybody here should know JS.
[05:30] Nuck: If they don't, we generally slap them.

[05:30] SubStack: javascript? people still use that?
[05:31] Nuck: SubStack: I hear PHP is better.
[05:31] progrock: wel, great conversation then, lol.. no one even has anything to say about definePopert.. or the similar getter/setter functions
[05:31] Nuck: I hear it's great because it's so slow that it forces your users to learn patience.
[05:32] Nuck: Somebody found an issue in my https://gist.github.com/0d651314e66dfd2675e3 parser thingy
[05:33] Nuck: Now that I want to use it seriously, I need to fix that issue
[05:33] Nuck: I think it was something with a type?

[05:35] progrock: Nuck: ummm... why did you program that?.. to accomplish what?
[05:35] sethuhdiah has joined the channel
[05:36] Nuck: progrock: That line?
[05:36] Nuck: It's a chunk of my parser
[05:36] progrock: what i;m sayin is.. whats the use.. ooks ike you are going through a lot of effort o do a trivial thing
[05:36] Nuck: It's essentially a very basic subset of mustache with only one curly brace
[05:36] Nuck: Not at all
[05:36] Nuck: I know what I'm doing ;)
[05:37] Nuck: most of the code in my parser is error and type checking
[05:37] progrock: oh.. just doing templating?
[05:37] Nuck: As well as argument handling
[05:38] sethuhdiah: is there an easy way i can tell if nodejs is installed right.. when i view a simple nodejs example i get "reference error "required" not defined"
[05:38] progrock: heh, I was more getting at text parsing is just ugly in JS.. an usually theres a better way to do whatever you are
[05:38] Nuck: sethuhdiah: You're fucking up and doing "required()" instead of "require()" I think ;)
[05:38] Nuck: Probably just a simple typo.
[05:39] Nuck: progrock: Not reliably.
[05:39] sethuhdiah: nah its require.. so i fucked up installing
[05:39] Nuck: sethuhdiah: Eh, no, that's Node giving you an error.
[05:39] Nuck: On your code.
[05:39] Nuck: Are you SURE you didn't use "required" at all?
[05:40] sethuhdiah: yea buddy im just trying to run one of the test scripts that came with
[05:40] chjj: progrock: what do you mean "text parsing is ugly in js"?
[05:40] Nuck: sethuhdiah: Are you telling me that it's fine without checking?
[05:41] progrock: Nuck: obviously I dont know all the details, or the reasoning.. nor am I the biggest fan of server side JS (well, I love the no context switch between front end, node, and mongo) but beond that... I agre with how my company has shit set up... scala on the backend (since we need the ability to test the backend calculaions pretty seriously
[05:41] chjj: scala
[05:41] Nuck: progrock: Then you underestimate the power of NodeJS.
[05:41] Nuck: JavaScript is an absolutely beautiful language.
[05:41] Nuck: And Node just makes it better.
[05:41] progrock: chjj: obviously depends on what you are doing.. but in most cases where I see people using text parsing in JS, it owuld have been btter to use closures (again, likely not the design goal of whatever Nuck is doing... im sure he has reasons for it)
[05:42] seivan has joined the channel
[05:42] chjj: sorry, i just kind of jumped in here, i dont know what nuck is doing
[05:42] Nuck: progrock: I'm a heavy user of closures.  I seriosuly use them as much as a hobo uses drugs.
[05:42] Nuck: But, I can't see why you would muck up the elegance of this code with a closure.
[05:42] chjj: im just confused by that one statement, "text parsing is ugly in js"
[05:43] progrock: Nuck: I'm a huge JS fan... but between the type checking, and the purely functional code in scala... not to mention it strick and static typing.... defntely makes testing, especially the financial calculations my company does, much asier and more powerful
[05:43] progrock: easier*
[05:43] Nuck: ... "purely functional"
[05:43] jerrysv has joined the channel
[05:43] Nuck: THAT makes me want to shoot somebody.
[05:43] Nuck: Functional code IS NOT better.
[05:43] SubStack: pretty sure scala isn't a pure functional language
[05:43] progrock: lol
[05:43] Nuck: In many cases, it is actually WORSE.
[05:43] Nuck: People need to grow up and realize they're all DIFFERENT TOOLS
[05:43] chjj: i have a better point of note: scala is scala
[05:44] SubStack: clean, pure, haskell, ok sure
[05:44] Nuck: OOP is great for many, MANY situations.
[05:44] progrock: Nuck: when it comes to unit testing mathematical code.. purely function code with no side effects is MUCH easier to test... you can GAURANTEE ti works 100% from etsting and type checking
[05:44] SubStack: although in haskell you can still do unsafePerformIO >:D
[05:44] progrock: Nuck: scala is also OO.....
[05:44] Nuck: Evented paradigms are great for some situations
[05:44] chjj: holy holy, am i listening to nuck or an imposter nuck?
[05:44] Nuck: And functional paradigms in another
[05:44] Nuck: It's all different things.
[05:45] progrock: Nuck: yeah.. well, this specific task is more or less the ideal case for where functional is definitely better.. again, these arent universal statements.. they are directly related to what we are using scala for
[05:45] Nuck: People get into these "camps" where they refuse to accept anything but their perfect language.  We've all done it before.  I'm guilty of hating on CoffeeScript.
[05:45] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[05:45] chjj: if its the kind of scala thats implemented in java, i dont want to hear about it
[05:45] progrock: man, your not even listening
[05:46] progrock: well, I;ve had enough
[05:46] Nuck: progrock: I'd argue that in the case of transactions, an event-driven paradigm is better.
[05:46] Nuck: And "type checking" should rarely be an issue to a good JS dev.
[05:46] jmoyers: uh
[05:46] jmoyers: type safety is a religious war
[05:46] progrock: I'm done, not arguing, especialy if youre skewing what I am saying (seems liek you're ready half the sntence)
[05:47] jmoyers: and you can argue that typed languages are much better for certain classes of applications
[05:47] progrock: anwyay, I'll leav eyou to your code, and I'll be getting back to mine
[05:47] Nuck: If you know what you're doing, you shouldn't accidentally fuck up types in your own code.
[05:47] jmoyers: thats horseshit
[05:47] Nuck: Now, type-checking incomind data, that's another story.
[05:47] Nuck: THAT is needed.
[05:47] Nuck: jmoyers: I've NEVER had trouble with my types being fucked up in my own code.
[05:47] progrock: ... I am more of a JS programmer than a scala one anyway... lol... but they both have their uses
[05:47] jmoyers: i prefer dynamic languages, but you can't disregard type safety out of hand
[05:48] ummm22 has joined the channel
[05:48] Nuck: What I DO want is the ability to have automatic type coercion as a language construct
[05:48] Nuck: So I can have incoming data for a function automatically coerced if I so desire.
[05:49] jmoyers: automatic coersion provides none of the benefits of type safety
[05:49] jmoyers: and you can do it with a library like validator
[05:49] KingJamool has joined the channel
[05:49] Nuck: Personally, I never saw the purpose for type safety.  I think it provides more room for failure in fringe cases.
[05:49] jmoyers: strong typing is also faster, broadly speaking
[05:50] jmoyers: room for failure?
[05:50] jmoyers: its the exact opposite
[05:50] progrock: heh
[05:50] Nuck: I disagree
[05:50] Nexxy: lewl
[05:50] Nuck: By implied type coercion, you get many cases where the type is safely fixed without breaking shit.
[05:50] chjj: im so bored im sitting here watching this
[05:50] mcluskydodallas has joined the channel
[05:51] Nuck: So there's less chance for one of your rarely-used bits of code to die.
[05:51] jmoyers: 'fixed' -- type coersion also covers up a ton of problems
[05:51] Nuck: I disagree, as long as the problem is solved, there's nothing wrong IMO.
[05:51] Aphelion has joined the channel
[05:51] jmoyers: look, all im suggesting
[05:51] jmoyers: dont be so dogmatic
[05:51] jmoyers: javascript isn't jesus
[05:52] jmoyers: its super great, and node is great
[05:52] sethuhdiah has left the channel
[05:52] Nuck: jmoyers: I'm not being dogmatic, I accept that JS isn't jesus, but honestly, functional should be a very rare paradigm.
[05:52] Nuck: It's harder to maintain, it's harder to follow, and it's barely better than spaghetti code.
[05:52] progrock: but yeah, functional with strict typing has its enefits... ie.  this function can ONLY take this range of values (if you try differently, wont compile) and if the code is pure (no side effects) you know that input A will ALWAYS give you output B. and you can gauranteee that every possible input gives a valid output
[05:52] jmoyers: 'functional should be a very rare paradigm' says a guy who's working with a language that has no classical inheritance built in...
[05:52] zomgbie has joined the channel
[05:53] Nuck: jmoyers: Classical inheritance?  Meh.  I have prototypes.
[05:53] jmoyers: which you use to emulate classical OO
[05:53] chjj: jmoyers: says who?
[05:53] avalanche123 has joined the channel
[05:53] Ratty_: Sometimes I seem to hit an infinite loop and get a "Maximum call stack size exceeded" error. But there's no backtrace so I can't identify where the problem is. How can I get a backtrace?
[05:53] jmoyers: says him, 30 lines up
[05:53] progrock: nbow, yeah, you can be smart abt your programming, and in theory  have JS code doign a th same thing.. but if you (or more importantly someone else) does seomthign wrong (ie wrong type).... not liek you know instantly (not at compile....) and you cant test every possible input hen theeres inifinite possibilites
[05:53] Nuck: jmoyers: If you do that, you're making a mistake.
[05:53] Nuck: I NEVER use classical inheritance.
[05:54] Nuck: In fact, I rarely even use inheritance to begin with!
[05:54] jmoyers: okay, so what are you refering to when you say OO if not polymorphism and encapsulation?
[05:54] chjj: well no, it isnt as good as it could be in js
[05:54] Nuck: chjj: Sure, it's not the best, but it works.
[05:55] Nuck: jmoyers: I mean exactly that.
[05:55] chjj: no im saying, youre inclined to think like classical oo, because you can only think from the top looking down
[05:55] Nuck: prototypes can do it too.
[05:55] progrock: anyway.. back to my Data Vis work, lol
[05:55] Nuck: chjj: Maybe you can only think from the top down but I don't
[05:55] chjj: the best we have contrary to that is __proto__
[05:55] Nuck: I think bottom up.
[05:55] Nuck: I shit you not.
[05:55] chjj: youre not listening to me
[05:56] chjj: in js, you can change an objects prototype after the fact
[05:56] chjj: cant*
[05:56] progrock: and jmoyers, nice 'arguments'.. heh.. nice to know someones knowedgable in here ;)
[05:56] Nuck: I developed an inheritance resolver for something I'm building.  Inheritance is done through child-parent one-to-many relationships.
[05:56] Nuck: chjj: Maybe not, but that never bothered me.
[05:56] Nuck: ACTION shrugs
[05:56] jmoyers: well i prefer dynamic languages, like i said. but you have to see both sides of the argument
[05:57] progrock: umm.. didnt crockford beat this shit out of the subject of inheritance iin JS... probably worth usin his methds
[05:57] Nuck: You hafta understand, I learned JavaScript before I learned any other OO language, so to me, this is all normal.
[05:57] jmoyers: blech crockford
[05:57] progrock: jmoyers: same here, JS is actually my favorite language to use
[05:57] Nuck: progrock: Crockford was a paranoid crazy.
[05:57] chjj: well, its fine, but it does make the language less dynamic, and dare i say it, that much closer to being classical
[05:57] AAA_awright: I learned PHP long before anything, so C and JS both seem normal
[05:57] jmoyers: don't follow all the 10 year old advice you find
[05:57] progrock: haha... he has some good stuff
[05:57] jmoyers: he does indeed
[05:58] jmoyers: not all of it
[05:58] jmoyers: jslint, for one
[05:58] Nuck: Yeah, like 3 pieces of it.
[05:58] progrock: but, i;ve been learning more from d3 than I have form any other JS code (including jqery)
[05:58] Nuck: I can count his good ideas on one hand.
[05:58] chjj: nuck: im saying its that much *closer* to being classical because of that
[05:58] jmoyers: this is what i mean
[05:58] Nuck: It'd take me more fingers than I've got to count how many good ideas he had.
[05:58] jmoyers: dont be so arrogant ;-)
[05:58] progrock: Nuck: clearly not giving him the credit thats due
[05:58] Nuck: Errr, bad
[05:58] Nuck: progrock: He made JSLint, he argued against some bad practices.
[05:58] Nuck: But he also argued against many not-so-bad practices.
[05:59] Nuck: In fact, those outnumbered the practices that WERE bad.
[05:59] progrock: but clearly you are 10 times the programmer he is.. not that hes one of the main reasons JS is the digusting beast that it appeared to be 12 years ago with all the horrible source...
[05:59] chjj: jslint is just the vehicle of the terrible practices he encourages
[05:59] sebastia_: is there some way to get the values of an object as an array?
[05:59] progrock: isn;t*
[05:59] Nuck: Yep, he was one of the men who made JS where it is today, right.
[05:59] Nuck: Totally.
[05:59] Nuck: Not just a crazy bastard who got a lot of influence.
[05:59] Nuck: Honestly, he did help us.
[06:00] Nuck: But not as much as people seem to think.
[06:00] SubStack: sebastia_: not natively
[06:00] progrock: man, you are fucking arogrant.. let me guess, a 22 year old CS major?
[06:00] jmoyers: Object.keys + [] syntax

[06:01] progrock: but yeah, you are definitely the arrogant / ignorant type... but hey, if your halfway decent at programming, in a few years youll probably get over it
[06:02] Nuck: progrock: It's not so much that I'm arrogant, it's that you seem to be one of the goddamned sheep who follow the Gods around.
[06:02] Nuck: Douglas Crockford was a great man, definitely.
[06:02] progrock: hahahhahah
[06:02] jmoyers: i guess im a sheep too
[06:02] progrock: man, your fucking hilrious
[06:02] Nuck: But not as great as you make him out to be.
[06:03] progrock: theres ony 1 JS progammer I truelly appreciate right now, and you likely dont know him
[06:03] Nuck: Honestly, his subset of JS was completely restrictive.
[06:03] SubStack: I haven't used any of crockford's modules, can't comment
[06:03] Nuck: You would not BELIEVE the shit he argues.
[06:03] jesusabdullah: SubStack: He doesn't *have* any modules I bet!
[06:03] Nuck: If you actually read his stuff, you'd agree that he's a raving loon.
[06:03] chjj: nuck: was anyone defending crockford in the first place? im confused as to why this is all about crockford
[06:03] jesusabdullah: SubStack: You did read TGP though right?
[06:03] progrock: hahahaha
[06:04] Nuck: chjj: progrock referenced him and argued he was so much better than me.
[06:04] jmoyers: he is better than you
[06:04] progrock: clearly 
[06:04] Nuck: He was just another programmer like the rest of us.
[06:04] jesusabdullah: Well, yeah, can't argue that one

[06:04] jesusabdullah: json was a good idea, yeah
[06:04] Nuck: JSON *was* a good idea.
[06:04] SubStack: jesusabdullah: not more than a few pages
[06:04] Nuck: But all the practices for JS he argued were shit.
[06:04] progrock: Fuck man, Nuck, if you honestly did 1 thing worth mentioning, I may not think you were such an arrogant fool.. but yeah. i'm willing to bet you jsut got a bunch of garbage that you'll realize is reaterded
[06:05] Nuck: Except a few hich were already known.
[06:05] Nuck: (don't use `with`, etc.)
[06:05] progrock: your grasp on other programming paradigms makes it very obvious 'you dont know shit'
[06:05] felixge: ACTION doesn't like it when his internet friends are fighting ... will come back when everybody is happy again.
[06:05] Nuck: progrock: I know programming paradigms damn well, I just think static typing's only benefit is speed.
[06:06] Nuck: And a tiny bit of clarity.
[06:06] SubStack: hey now you scared felix away :(
[06:06] chjj: oh man, you guys forced felixge out
[06:06] Nuck: But it's entirely too restrictive and begs for failure.
[06:06] chjj: shame on you
[06:06] progrock: narrow minded, lol.
[06:06] progrock: But hell, when I was 16 and in your posiiton.. I may have been worse, hahhaha
[06:06] Nuck: But agreed, we should stop for the sake of folks like felixge.
[06:06] Nuck: progrock: I am entirely offended that you consider age an indicator of intellect.
[06:07] jmoyers: nothing to do with intellect
[06:07] Nuck: When there are 12-year-olds who are entirely more intelligent than you or I.
[06:07] jmoyers: its just temperment :P
[06:07] progrock: wow, fuckign narrow minded again
[06:07] Nuck: Hell, probably smarter than Crockford.
[06:07] progrock: I am juding you on HOW you are acting, more specifically, the immature and arrogance

[06:11] SubStack: you just have to send a content-type multipart/octet-stream or similar
[06:11] jmoyers: yes yes, my friend
[06:11] Nuck: And I can tell you for a FACT that OOP is far better.
[06:11] jesusabdullah: I think *anything* adds overhead.
[06:11] SubStack: because browsers care about that stuff for some unimportant reaason
[06:11] chjj: oh i see what you did there

[06:11] Nuck: And code calls around.
[06:11] progrock: I love how hes acting like hes actuall programmed serious appications in any language.. let alone enough in an OOP and enough in a functional to truely ubnderstand either, et alone both
[06:11] jTNT: ACTION likes spaghetti
[06:12] jesusabdullah: Nuck: Are you talking about lisp?
[06:12] Nuck: This is the hell that Functional code leads to with anyone except the best.
[06:12] jesusabdullah: Nuck: because lisp had hella good ideas. It's aged really well imo
[06:12] Nuck: jesusabdullah: More a series of GOTO statements.
[06:12] SubStack: delicious spaghetti
[06:12] SubStack: speaking of
[06:12] chjj: substack: and hopefully draw attention away from the battle happening in the background
[06:12] SubStack: I should go buy some sauce
[06:12] progrock: lol... time to go program som haskel, haha
[06:12] jesusabdullah: Nuck: That's procedural programming, not functional
[06:12] SubStack: except for how my bike seat is still missing
[06:12] jTNT: ACTION has his with pesto
[06:12] akshatj: I find functional programming to easier than OO or procedural
[06:12] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Yes, but it's the same concept when you really boil it down.
[06:12] jesusabdullah: Nuck: procedural programming is inherently stateful, whereas fp isn't
[06:13] Nuck: Stacks will still exist, jesusabdullah.
[06:13] SubStack: functional combinators are a great tool for removing intermediate state
[06:13] Nuck: Functional programming still relies on arguments to functions, does it not?
[06:13] SubStack: fuck intermediate state
[06:13] jesusabdullah: Sure, but that's implementation
[06:13] jTNT: c'mon: FP / OO each have value: depends what you're building.
[06:13] Nuck: Guess what, there's always gonna be nasty interactions and such between functions.
[06:13] jesusabdullah: Yeah, there's no real such thing is a conceptual intermediate state in pure fp, nor are there non-constants
[06:14] jesusabdullah: ie, no vars
[06:14] Nuck: And this is why I argue that FP is the worst idea in years.
[06:14] jesusabdullah: Why?
[06:14] jesusabdullah: I program functionally all the time
[06:14] jesusabdullah: and I bet you do too
[06:14] Nuck: It reminds me of jQuery, a beautiful thing, but encourages spaghetti code.
[06:15] SubStack: Nuck: the point of a lot of functional combinators is to remove side effects
[06:15] jesusabdullah: Haskell probably isn't the best idea ever, but it's led to some beautiful code
[06:15] jesusabdullah: and gorgeous ideas
[06:15] jmoyers: Nuck http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html - read the section on the hypothetical language called 'Blub'
[06:15] SubStack: that would be one of those "nasty interactions" you're deriding
[06:15] jesusabdullah: Some would argue that python is blub
[06:15] SubStack: python is not good enough to be blub
[06:15] jTNT: ACTION steps outside ...
[06:15] SubStack: python wishes it were blub
[06:15] jesusabdullah: hah
[06:15] Nuck: SubStack: Do you REALLY think anyone but the best coders will switch to that?
[06:15] jesusabdullah: SASSY, substizzy
[06:15] chjj: it sounds like a mispronounciation of my language: b-luv
[06:16] Nuck: Seriously, it takes a  genius to keep things that encourage bad code from producing bad code
[06:16] jmoyers: this shit is my favorite programming quote in recent memory
[06:16] jmoyers: "But when our hypothetical Blub programmer looks in the other direction, up the power continuum, he doesn't realize he's looking up. What he sees are merely weird languages. He probably considers them about equivalent in power to Blub, but with all this other hairy stuff thrown in as well. Blub is good enough for him, because he thinks in Blub."
[06:16] Nuck: And FP encourages bad code by nature.
[06:16] Nuck: jmoyers: I know LISP is great.

[06:16] jesusabdullah: Nuck: Many mathematicians like haskell because they can speak the mathematical language they know way better than the stateful procedural approach you have to use with a lot of stuff
[06:16] chjj: megalomix: you might want to come back later, things are heated right now
[06:17] chjj: HEATED
[06:17] jesusabdullah: pffsht

[06:17] jesusabdullah: I'm not heated!
[06:17] chjj: heated...
[06:17] jmoyers: this shit is boooilin
[06:17] SubStack: HEATED LIKE A BOILING POT READY TO HEAT SOME PASTA
[06:17] chjj: mmm pasta
[06:17] Nuck: jmoyers: I know that article.
[06:17] jmoyers: pasta pile
[06:17] jesusabdullah: I think that, in the end, some problems are easier done in some ways than others
[06:17] Nuck: Been there, read that.
[06:17] Nuck: For 90% of cases, I think OOP is the ideal.
[06:18] Nuck: There will be forays into other areas, but overall, I think it will come back to this.
[06:18] philip__ has joined the channel
[06:18] jesusabdullah: People use objects/methods, anonymous functions as first class citizens (almost lisp-like), and ye olde for and while loops
[06:18] jesusabdullah: in javascript
[06:18] Nuck: Because FP is not as easily modularized as OOP.
[06:18] jesusabdullah: It has them all, and each is useful in different contexts
[06:18] Nuck: At least, not the same quality of code on both
[06:18] jesusabdullah: What?
[06:18] progrock: jmoyers: (or anone else) any chance you know of a good way to use defineProperty (or anything with the same funcitonality) on the major browsers ie8+, ff3+, and the current wbkits)
[06:18] jmoyers: just .. just stop
[06:19] jTNT: I think for 90% of cases, pesto is the best pasta sauce.
[06:19] jesusabdullah: There's some *amazing* FP software out there
[06:19] jmoyers: pesto is nothing but green mayo dude
[06:19] Nuck: If I got an average coder and had him write OOP and FP, the FP code would be the less maintainable.
[06:19] jmoyers: or at least a starbucks employee in new york told me that
[06:19] Nuck: I can assure you of that.
[06:19] chjj: jmoyers: what? you just shattered my world
[06:19] SubStack: Nuck: first-class functions are great for modularity
[06:19] jesusabdullah: What? No, pesto is green olive oil!
[06:19] progrock: damn it, someone has to fucking know enough about JS to answer this!
[06:19] Nuck: jmoyers: ... It's water, basil, and olive oil.
[06:19] jTNT: hmm, basil and pine nuts ...
[06:19] jmoyers: progrock not quite sure about defineProperty support in ie8
[06:19] Nuck: With a few other things
[06:19] jesusabdullah: Programmers aren't taught fp in school, though
[06:19] SubStack: instead of subclassing for custom functionality you can just pass your abstraction a function to perform the custom behavior
[06:20] antono has joined the channel
[06:20] jesusabdullah: nearly as much
[06:20] jTNT: ACTION was taught FP in school ...
[06:20] SubStack: like traverse
[06:20] jmoyers: a lot of people just use getters, such as obj.get('name') in the case where they need defineProperty, just to be safe
[06:20] progrock: jmoyers: well I know theres 2 diferent ways to get similar functionality.. but yeah.. I am reall interested in getting this to work for clietn side code
[06:20] jmoyers: if you're in a node-only environ, or es5, then defineProperty away
[06:20] progrock: it pretty fuckign powerful when you get into it
[06:20] jesusabdullah: Oh, yeah, anything that uses python decorators is inherently functional
[06:20] Nuck: Functional programming is fune, but the core of any system ought to be Object-driven.
[06:20] jesusabdullah: even if it's a retarded idea
[06:20] Nuck: *fine
[06:20] saikat has joined the channel
[06:20] progrock: I want it on the cient side, lol
[06:20] jesusabdullah: I think objects are a requirement for a language today
[06:20] progrock: client*
[06:20] jesusabdullah: but so are first-class functions
[06:21] Nuck: Sure, they both are.
[06:21] SubStack: haskell has records
[06:21] jmoyers: yeah.. well you're shit out of luck if you're supporting crappy browsers ;-)
[06:21] Nuck: I generally make my functions act as Objects in JS.
[06:21] jmoyers: take a look at how backbone.js does getters
[06:21] Nuck: In fact
[06:21] jesusabdullah: Well, they *are* both
[06:21] Nuck: That's primarily how I work nowadays.
[06:21] chjj: nuck: functions are objects
[06:21] progrock: the only server side JS we use a work is phantomjs for pdf generation.... i want to use this in some of the core client side code (data vis code to be exact)
[06:21] jesusabdullah: I've added attributes to functions before
[06:21] jesusabdullah: >:D
[06:21] Nuck: chjj: Precisely ;)
[06:21] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Who HASN'T?
[06:21] jTNT: remember: closures are poor man's objects
[06:21] chjj: although, you cant normally make a constructor spit them out
[06:21] jTNT:  / objects are poor man's closures
[06:21] Nuck: But no, I use closures to form my own objects with hidden properties :P

[06:22] jesusabdullah: This is why I like javascript. It's packed with a lot of important language features.
[06:23] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Same.
[06:23] Nuck: I can do what I want how I want.
[06:23] jesusabdullah: Yeah, even if it feels kludgy/crufty sometimes it's got all of the sweetest shit
[06:23] Nuck: Part of why I can't stand Crockford's teachings is because he limits eveyrbody to his own personal style.
[06:23] jTNT: always wanted to do that ...
[06:23] progrock: jmoyers: is backbone your project?
[06:23] jmoyers: shit no
[06:23] jmoyers: popular mvc
[06:23] jesusabdullah: jTNT: Why'd you hit me? D:
[06:23] jTNT: backbone rocks.
[06:24] chjj: wait wait wait
[06:24] jesusabdullah: I haven't had a chance to test drive it
[06:24] chjj: lets talk about mvc now
[06:24] jmoyers: hahaha
[06:24] jmoyers: i refuse
[06:24] Nuck: I honestly don't strictly/consciously stick to MVC.
[06:24] jmoyers: bro i only use mvvm
[06:24] jmoyers: also, lets talk about ORMs
[06:24] jesusabdullah: I suspect that mvc is a useful concept, but I bet it's relatively heavyweight for a lot of stuff
[06:24] Nuck: I usually just split it up and it ends up as MVC-ish.
[06:24] jesusabdullah: hmm
[06:24] progrock: heh, if I ever get some free time, i still wanna finish this trivial JS powered blog... literally gonna have like 100 lines of server side code for everything I need (just need it to load and save shit in mongo, and do 1 o 2 trivial tasks)
[06:24] Nuck: I don't need a framework to force me into something :P
[06:24] insin has joined the channel
[06:25] chjj: what i dont like about mvc...is that everyone almost automatically regards it as correct and the best course for their project without any consideration
[06:25] chjj: everyone just says, "well, mvc thats it, right?"
[06:25] Nuck: Hell, if I could get jQuery's features in normal style code, I would prefer that
[06:25] jmoyers: yeah, time tested design patterns suck balls
[06:25] louissmit has joined the channel
[06:25] progrock: jesusabdullah: ehh, depends how you look at it... like the blog I plan to code will use MVC, but its gonna hve soooo litte code.. its jsut a logical way of breaking the 'application into 3 parts
[06:25] jesusabdullah: I also am like, "tell me about your mvc framework" and then I hear "blah blah views blah blah template engine"

[06:26] SubStack: chjj: sounds like availability bias!
[06:26] jesusabdullah: jTNT: Haha, nice. :D
[06:26] chjj: sounds like people should think more
[06:26] progrock: lol, my last job interviewd asked me to describe MVC.. such a trivial concept... its almsot as bad as being asked to describe restful applications
[06:26] Nuck: I use Mongo for a database, server-side shit is NodeJS+Express creating a RESTed API, then I build a frontend using jQuery
[06:26] chjj: even if mvc is the best choice
[06:27] butu5 has joined the channel
[06:27] jesusabdullah: I actually quite like jquery's approach, though it feels a bit entangled to me
[06:27] jmoyers: declarative event delegation, common fetch/save tasks, convenient collection management, client side routing/pushstate/history, validation
[06:27] Nuck: chjj: People seem to just "follow the Gods"
[06:27] jmoyers: the list goes on
[06:27] jmoyers: its just nice stuff in a nice package
[06:27] jesusabdullah: I want to try the shit on ender.js actually
[06:27] Nuck: jesusabdullah: It makes shit very unmodular, that's the problem.
[06:27] jmoyers: forget mvc
[06:27] Nuck: It's wonderful, the features it has
[06:27] jesusabdullah: YOU're unmodular!
[06:27] Nuck: I love the wrappers
[06:27] jesusabdullah: but more seriously, explain
[06:27] SubStack: REST is pretty shit for a lot of things
[06:27] Nuck: I just think chaining encourages unmaintainable code
[06:27] progrock: jesusabdullah: I used to think jquery was the shit.. then I staretd using d3 (for a different use of course), its soo much cooler imo.. has some amazing concepts.
[06:27] chjj: jesusabdullah: if you make an ender.js bundle, you should use my selector engine
[06:27] jmoyers: it doesn't assume REST
[06:27] Nuck: It's very tempting to just inline my chained code
[06:27] jesusabdullah: chjj: selector engine you say?
[06:28] chjj: yessir
[06:28] jmoyers: override Backbone.sync and use DNode :P?!
[06:28] jesusabdullah: I think that's by far the most useful part of jquery to me
[06:28] jesusabdullah: so: SHOW MEEEE
[06:28] progrock: I also like how protovis has a JS 1.8.5 parser (well for shorthand function definitions at least)
[06:28] chjj: jesusabdullah: https://github.com/chjj/zest
[06:28] chjj: jesusabdullah: its faster than sizzle and supports css4 selectors
[06:28] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Just use the selector engine from jQuery
[06:28] Nuck: CSS4?
[06:28] Nuck: ...
[06:28] jTNT: sizzle
[06:28] chjj: selectors level 4, yes

[06:29] megalomix: chjj, what happen? :)
[06:29] chjj: yeah, its been in the works informally for a while, then in the form of editors drafts
[06:29] Nuck: progrock: Oh god, I KNOW
[06:29] Nuck: It's stupid that it doesn't exist!
[06:29] chjj: progrock: there is going to be a subject selector in css4, better than a parent selector
[06:29] jTNT: ACTION wants a replacement for the box model.
[06:29] progrock: I always have a block of JS labeled "styles" for that shit.. pretty shitty I have to resort to that
[06:30] insin: anyone know if there's a lib out there for writing wrappers around aync APIs before I start trying to write one? Thinking of something which completely emulates the API, but adds functions to a list of steps to be performed and returns another wrapper exposing the API of the expected result, then something which runs and hooks together the lot at the end and handles chaining the steps together

[06:31] insin: I know there are plenty of flow control libraries and things like promises, this would be more like a layer above those, just finding it hard to search for :)
[06:31] insin: Any good links?

[06:49] Nuck: torsd: Well, we're not entirely sure on the details, but we've got some very interesting product concepts that we think will encourage people to join us :P Not to mention dA is failing massively in recent months, so their failures are our successes.
[06:49] jesusabdullah: like, eat a pile of shit or get shot
[06:49] progrock: I get to spend haf my time making really awesoe data visualizations.. shits pretty damn interesting and fun (and already gotten mutiple job offers based on what ive prodcued here)
[06:49] jesusabdullah: Actually, that's a hard one
[06:49] arnee has joined the channel
[06:49] jesusabdullah: I think I might get shot
[06:49] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Erm, I'd rather get shot in that analogy, but I would do what I hate or continue trying to find a better opportunity
[06:50] jesusabdullah: ahaha
[06:50] progrock: jesusabdullah: Id take a 22 to the ass before eating a ple of shit
[06:50] jesusabdullah: ^5
[06:50] Nuck: progrock: oooh, kinky.
[06:50] chjj: best toprated youtube comment ive seen today: "Thumbs up if you have facebook opened﻿ in another tab."
[06:50] jesusabdullah: My analogies tend to break down very quickly
[06:50] jesusabdullah: I think that's okay
[06:51] chjj: where would the world be without youtube comments?
[06:51] jesusabdullah: analogy is powerful, but it's also a brittle thing too
[06:51] jesusabdullah: just in general
[06:52] jesusabdullah: chjj: Here's hoping your markdown parser ends up being awesome
[06:53] jomoho has joined the channel
[06:53] jesusabdullah: I don't actually like gfm
[06:53] Nuck: jesusabdullah: I like the ```-stuff
[06:53] jesusabdullah: because it "respects" line wraps. I prefer the original way
[06:53] Nuck: But TBH, I'm a noob at GFM.
[06:53] jesusabdullah: Yeah, ``` is nice
[06:53] progrock: 90% done with a visualization similr to this: http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/16266    just a little less chartjunk on mine.. and mine is visualizes an investment managers ortfolio
[06:53] progrock: portfolio*
[06:54] jesusabdullah: It'd be cool to have a parser that could switch modes
[06:55] chjj: jesusabdullah: ah cool, i wrote it for speed, its pretty fast
[06:55] chjj: jesusabdullah: GFM is on the todo list
[06:55] jesusabdullah: Word
[06:55] jesusabdullah: chjj: Please at least make the linewrap behavior optional? Please?
[06:56] jesusabdullah: I like to write my shit to 80 chars and still have it re-linewrap on render
[06:56] chjj: for gfm? yeah i might, i always found regular markdown double spaces were enough
[06:56] jesusabdullah: yeah
[06:56] jesusabdullah: !
[06:56] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Then set your text editor to 80-width.
[06:56] Nuck: I never understood why people don't do that
[06:56] Nuck: Same reason I don't get why people hate tabs
[06:56] jesusabdullah: Nuck: You misunderstand. The text editor is fine, I just don't like writing lines longer than 80 characters
[06:56] Nuck: tabs are adjustable to a user's preferences
[06:57] jesusabdullah: It's a matter of style.
[06:57] chjj: jesusabdullah: if you want "loose" list items as theyre called, you can checkout my experimental branch, i havent merged them with master yet, but theyll come soon
[06:57] chjj: i dont think most people use them though
[06:57] jesusabdullah: loose list items?
[06:57] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Do you manually wrap to 80?
[06:57] jesusabdullah: Nuck: Yes.
[06:57] jesusabdullah: It's a matter of .txt style rules
[06:57] chjj: jesusabdullah: list items that are spaced apart so they get wrapped in paragraphs, its part of the markdown "spec"
[06:57] AAA_awright: ATTENTION DEVELOPERS: TABS TO INDENT, SPACES TO ALIGN
[06:57] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Better way is to just set your text editor to 80-width
[06:57] Nuck: And let it wrap.
[06:57] jesusabdullah: Nonono
[06:58] Nuck: AAA_awright: I use tabs to align TBH.
[06:58] AAA_awright: THANK YOU
[06:58] chjj: i might merge that branch tonight
[06:58] Nuck: AAA_awright: However, I've been debating making a switch to spaces...
[06:58] jesusabdullah: chjj: I think I might use those things
[06:58] AAA_awright: Nuck: If you're aligning one character or so, but anything more mesees up my 3-space tabs
[06:58] Nuck: AAA_awright: Aligning objects, before or afte the :
[06:58] progrock: My favorite line of code for today:
[06:58] jesusabdullah: I think it works on reddit but not on github
[06:58] AAA_awright: I actually don't align anything, I indent exclusively
[06:59] AAA_awright: Well hm
[06:59] Nuck: AAA_awright: Ah.  I align large objects.
[06:59] Nuck: Smaller ones, I don't bother
[06:59] progrock: function functor(fn) { return typeof fn === 'function' ? fn : function() { return fn }; }
[06:59] Nuck: But when they grow to 15 lines and have varying key-lengths
[06:59] AAA_awright: { property: "value"
[06:59] AAA_awright: , property2: "value"
[06:59] AAA_awright: } seems to work pretty well
[06:59] chjj: jesusabdullah: yeah, ill get to work on merging that branch, i hate to think im dissapointing people with it, its the one markdown feature i dont support, instead your list items will just be like normal list items
[07:00] chjj: instead of <li><p>hello</p></li> you get <li>hello</li>
[07:00] jesusabdullah: I like to tab things weird sometimes, in a way that doesn't always lend itself to tabs, and I don't like mixing tabs and spaces
[07:00] niftylettuce: jesusabdullah: actually there is a CTRL+SHIFT+A align plugin for gedit
[07:00] Draggor: progrock: where is that legitimately used?
[07:00] jesusabdullah: chjj: That sounds reasonable
[07:00] Nuck: AAA_awright: I do the traditional syntax for objects.  For commas on vars, with the comma-leading style
[07:00] niftylettuce: oh nevermind read that wrong lol
[07:00] jesusabdullah: niftylettuce: Oh? sounds nifty
[07:01] progrock: Draggor: protovis... it allows you to define attributes as functions or constants... that wraps constants into  function so you can access both the same way
[07:01] niftylettuce: jesusabdullah: yeah its in gmate or on gedit-icing
[07:01] Nuck: jesusabdullah: Not as nifty as that lettuce over that

[07:17] jmoyers: insin im confused -- so its taking some like async, step, etc and naming the processes?
[07:17] jmoyers: looks like a promise implementation to me
[07:20] admc has joined the channel
[07:20] insin: it's more like instead of writing your own callbacks for use with promises or whatever implementation and hooking them all up yourself, you would write objects which implement the same methods as the async API you want to use and would generate the callbacks for you, then some piece which does the hooking up for you... I'm confused too! ;)
[07:23] jmoyers: i dont know
[07:23] jmoyers: i'd call it a specific implementation of a job queue
[07:23] jmoyers: or something of that nature
[07:23] jmoyers: a little bit of deferred/future/promise type thing
[07:24] jmoyers: if you want to make it declarative (make someone inherit from your prototype) to create a list of tasks, thats fine. i think most people thinks its fine to just name functions or use Step/async/any of the job queue managers
[07:24] jmoyers: i'd scan here quickly: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules#wiki-async-flow and make sure nobody's got an implementation that catches your fancy
[07:26] insin: Yeah, I've been through it, loads of great stuff which I think would be heavily used in an implementation of what I want to do

[08:29] DrMcKay: pradeek: in callback use it's first argument
[08:29] DrMcKay: pradeek: in the sample code on nodejs.org it's req

[08:33] chjj: pradeek, internally its referred to as http.IncomingMessage
[08:33] DrMcKay: ACTION digs in the source code
[08:33] SubStack: pradeek: you could probably check Object.getPrototypeOf(obj).constructor.name

[08:34] dmkbot: http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/http.html#http.ServerRequest
[08:34] pradeek: @chjj Will try what you said. Docs say ServerRequest tho.
[08:35] SubStack: yep, IncomingMessage
[08:35] SubStack: for req.constructor.name
[08:35] chjj: it does, but internally its IncomingMessage
[08:35] chjj: i guess it says that to make the documentation more clear and consistent
[08:35] SubStack: aha and IncomingMessage is exposed on http
[08:35] reid has joined the channel
[08:35] chjj: because, for example, ServerResponse inherits from OutgoingMessage
[08:36] SubStack: (req instanceof http.IncomingMessage) is true in my tests

[08:37] DrMcKay: is it only me or does the documentation need some love?
[08:37] chjj: its tradition that node studying require google searches

[08:37] DrMcKay: I prefer reading source
[08:37] chjj: :)
[08:38] chjj: yes
[08:38] DrMcKay: OK, so let it be this way :)

[09:56] DrMcKay: ay: oh, ok
[09:56] ay:    case s_res_status:
[09:56] ay:         /* the human readable status. e.g. "NOT FOUND"
[09:56] ay: * we are not humans so just ignore this */
[09:56] ay: :-(
[09:56] DrMcKay: yes, I see
[09:56] ay: But I am human!
[09:56] chjj: you are a secret robot
[09:56] chjj: most people are
[09:57] DrMcKay: ay: I can't believe you, sorry
[09:57] ay: Ok you got me. I'm written in assembler and a bit of lisp and fortran and a tiny bit of brainfuck.

[09:58] DrMcKay: ay: but no, seriously, I doubt there's something you can do with it
[09:59] DrMcKay: ay: if you just need status line you can use sockets and write your own http client
[09:59] DrMcKay: ay: but well, this parser is a bit weird
[09:59] ay: Maybe my first patch to node.js should be comming up.
[09:59] chjj: ay: you could do something

[10:00] ay: But then again, I'm just a bot..
[10:00] chjj: and look for the message yourself
[10:00] chjj: wouldnt be easy or elegant
[10:00] chjj: but it could work
[10:01] chjj: afterward you would probably throw some property on the socket, which could be picked up in the request listener
[10:02] cclafferty has joined the channel
[10:02] ay: But do people agree with this bot that the status message should be available in res? It is a missing feature wouldn't you say?
[10:03] chjj: oh nevermind im stupid you wanted the response line
[10:03] chjj: ignore me
[10:03] chjj: :)
[10:03] chjj: you still could possibly do it the other way though
[10:03] chjj: with a client, if you got the raw socket object
[10:03] chjj: and listened for data events
[10:03] DrMcKay: ay: yes
[10:03] mraleph has joined the channel
[10:04] ay: Yes. But it's fugly. The response object should have it since it allready has the status code.
[10:04] DrMcKay: ay: create an issue and see if rest of guys want it

[10:30] TheJH: uhm, franck34, wait... myArray["a"] is kinda wrong
[10:30] franck34: ok
[10:30] TheJH: franck34, JS arrays don't have strings as keys
[10:30] TheJH: franck34, for that, you have to use an object
[10:31] franck34: ha
[10:31] TheJH: franck34, then, you can get a sorted list of keys using Object.keys(obj).sort()
[10:31] franck34: you mean mainObject.b=myObjectB; mainObject.a=myObjectA ?

[10:43] franck34: well, 1, 2 in fact are quoteID from db

[13:23] DrMcKay_: umm... this libuv is the core of node.js, right?
[13:24] Sembiance: hrm?
[13:24] DrMcKay_: but it's a C library, so it would be theorertically possible to port to Python.
[13:25] DrMcKay_: I mean: use it from Python
[13:25] DrMcKay_: do something like node.js but in Python
[13:25] misterm: DrMcKay_: depends on how you define "core"
[13:25] DrMcKay_: misterm: it handles I/O asynchronously, right?
[13:25] misterm: libec is the core of the event loop, yea
[13:25] misterm: *libev
[13:26] DrMcKay_: (at least this is how code looks like)
[13:26] DrMcKay_: libuv
[13:26] DrMcKay_: I think I have to learn how to write Python modules in C
[13:27] DrMcKay_: and why the hell do I have this underscore?
[13:27] DrMcKay has joined the channel
[13:28] bentkus: DrMcKay: Awesome languages can access C code from the language itself
[13:29] hasta84 has joined the channel
[13:30] DrMcKay: bentkus: Python has some bindings for dl_open and friends, I think
[13:30] chjj: i heard C can do that
[13:30] bentkus: you can HEAR?
[13:30] DrMcKay: bentkus: yes, it does, ld module
[13:31] DrMcKay: or ctypes
[13:31] DrMcKay: chjj: what language is it?
[13:31] DrMcKay: chjj: I haven't heard about it yet
[13:31] int_64 has joined the channel
[13:31] DrMcKay: probably some hipsterish shit
[13:31] chjj: DrMcKay: what language? im not sure, its this weird language called C
[13:31] chjj: i think its pretty new
[13:32] coreb has joined the channel
[13:32] DrMcKay: what interpreter runs it?
[13:32] DrMcKay: I can't find one :/
[13:32] chjj: i think its implemented in java
[13:32] chjj: wait...yeah, pretty sure java
[13:32] coreb: with node 0.5, is there a build of npm that works on windows?
[13:32] DrMcKay: coreb: cygwin
[13:32] DrMcKay: chjj: oh, there are way too many languages for jvm now
[13:33] chjj: i think i would still use node with cygwin
[13:33] bentkus: there actually some funny projects
[13:33] bentkus: like C compilers which compile C to javascript
[13:33] franck34: is there a way to md5(myString) with node ??
[13:33] bentkus: 300x slowdown
[13:33] franck34: seem's not using new buffer
[13:33] bentkus: yeah there is franck34, go to the official node.js site -> docs -> cryptography i guess
[13:33] chjj: franck34 require('crypto')
[13:33] franck34: thanks all

[13:38] johnnyboy: are you learning for a doctor DrMcKay?
[13:38] johnnyboy: then dont be so suprised :D
[13:38] bentkus: now i see that i should have just integrated nodejs and have it all at once
[13:39] bentkus: socket.io is the most awesome thing
[13:39] DrMcKay: johnnyboy: nah, vocational school
[13:39] DrMcKay: it technician
[13:39] Sembiance: bentkus: yah, socket.io has been cool from the very first day it came. It's nice :)
[13:39] Intuit` has joined the channel
[13:39] bentkus: I'm too lazy to create Socket.io-manos (for C#)
[13:39] johnnyboy: i guess there arent a lot of C wizards there :S
[13:40] DrMcKay: do you guys have vocational schools in your countries?
[13:40] DrMcKay: johnnyboy: no :(
[13:40] johnnyboy: int_64 LOL thats the nickname
[13:40] tuhoojabotti: DrMcKay: Yes.
[13:40] johnnyboy: fuckinell i come up here next time as size_t
[13:40] DrMcKay: tuhoojabotti: is it actually sane school?
[13:41] DrMcKay: I mean, in my class there are people who though they're going to play CS or something
[13:41] bentkus: there is an irc module
[13:41] johnnyboy: okay motherfuckers enough of the chit chat sy tell my
[13:41] tuhoojabotti: That's vocational school for you xD
[13:41] bentkus: i play cs too

[13:42] misterm: has anyone here used mongrel2 -> node?
[13:42] Kingdutch: Hi everyone, what's the easiest way to let a node program run under a certain group (For file access etc.) I can't start node as root which is needed for setgid
[13:42] bentkus: hooking virtual methods and reading assembler code all the time
[13:42] DrMcKay: best thing is that I've taken an exam at the beginning of the year, so I don't have to take this classes

[13:43] Kingdutch: Jup
[13:43] Kingdutch: Why do people suspect me of coding node.js for windows ?  :O
[13:43] DrMcKay: su -l user?
[13:43] bentkus: coding on windows
[13:43] johnnyboy: lol
[13:43] DrMcKay: lol
[13:43] johnnyboy: whoami
[13:44] bentkus: coding on windows is only a good idea when you are coding with visual studio for C#
[13:44] johnnyboy: c#
[13:44] johnnyboy: ?
[13:44] johnnyboy: devil's advocate!!!!
[13:44] bentkus: once you start hackign on awesome stuff, you better go unix
[13:44] johnnyboy: ban plz
[13:44] bentkus: im not advocating it stupid
[13:44] johnnyboy: :D
[13:44] Kingdutch: DrMcKay: But it's not a certain user
[13:44] Kingdutch: Just a certain group
[13:44] misterm: f# is kind of sweet
[13:44] DrMcKay: I remember those days when I didn't even know when Linux existed
[13:45] DrMcKay: it was such a pain

[13:46] DrMcKay: Kingdutch: you can't use sudo, right?
[13:46] bentkus: cool
[13:46] Kingdutch: sudo doesn't find node =/
[13:46] Kingdutch: Although I do have sudo access
[13:46] DrMcKay: oh, that's simple!
[13:46] DrMcKay: give it a full path
[13:46] Kingdutch: And jamesd I know about the various set*** to drop acecss
[13:46] Kingdutch: using nvm?
[13:47] DrMcKay: /usr/local/bin/node, probably
[13:47] johnnyboy: bentkus

[13:49] Kingdutch: DrMcKay: /home/kingdutch/.nvm/v0.4.9/bin/node : (
[13:49] DrMcKay: Kingdutch: than run it like that
[13:50] DrMcKay: sudo /home/kingdutch/.nvm/v0.4.9/bin/node script.js
[13:50] Kingdutch: Well yeah
[13:50] DrMcKay: v8bot: require('crypto')
[13:50] v8bot_: DrMcKay: Use v8: <code> to evaluate code or "`v commands" for a list of v8bot commands.
[13:50] Kingdutch: but I wanna put this in a start up script which makes that a bit tedious if versions change =/
[13:50] bentkus: dunno
[13:50] DrMcKay: v8: var crypto = require('crypto'); return crypto.createHash('md5');
[13:50] v8bot_: DrMcKay: ReferenceError: require is not defined
[13:50] bentkus: never used it
[13:50] bentkus: but it seems strange
[13:50] DrMcKay: fuck!
[13:50] bentkus: im using 4.9 too
[13:51] DrMcKay: Kingdutch: install node in some global localization, like /usr/bin
[13:51] bentkus: yeah, good idea
[13:51] DrMcKay: Kingdutch: that makes life a lot easier
[13:51] bentkus: and then give me your root password
[13:51] johnnyboy: bentkus :DDDDDDD
[13:51] johnnyboy: lol
[13:51] Kingdutch: Doesn't allow me to use nvm though =/

[13:53] DrMcKay: tuhoojabotti: I feel sorry for you
[13:53] bentkus: maybe you compiled it without some libmd5-dev present
[13:53] DrMcKay: but, when I look at my class...
[13:53] tuhoojabotti: DrMcKay: I'm in high school
[13:53] tuhoojabotti: or college
[13:53] tuhoojabotti: or something
[13:53] tuhoojabotti: lukio in finnish
[13:53] bentkus: Don't look at them, the norwegian dude already told us that you have to shoot them all
[13:53] DrMcKay: tuhoojabotti: I meant I feel sory for Finland :D
[13:54] tuhoojabotti: DrMcKay: We all do.
[13:54] johnnyboy: The crypto module requires OpenSSL to be available on the underlying platform.  lol this why
[13:54] johnnyboy: :D
[13:54] johnnyboy: fkinel
[13:54] bentkus: ./configure -- checkout the output
[13:54] johnnyboy: guess im goin to read the docs first
[13:54] DrMcKay: Kingdutch: why doesn't npm work?
[13:54] bentkus: it will probably return some hints about what is missing for md5
[13:54] johnnyboy: on a windows box atm
[13:54] johnnyboy: doesnt give me any warningz
[13:54] micheil: johnnyboy: you'll like the commit from yesterday then..
[13:54] DrMcKay: johnnyboy: Windows is a warning

[13:55] johnnyboy: wow lol
[13:55] johnnyboy: nice
[13:55] johnnyboy: thanks
[13:56] Raynos: It used to be that variables were written to `module`
[13:56] micheil: however, it's experimental still, afaik.
[13:56] micheil: it's just a branch to check that it works.
[13:57] johnnyboy: how can i ask node's version from node?
[13:57] johnnyboy: dunno what do i runnin
[13:57] micheil: node --version ?

[13:58] Kingdutch: DrMcKay: npm works, but nvm makes life easier for updating, although it doesn't give you an absolute path
[13:58] johnnyboy: thats wut i call pace
[13:59] DrMcKay: Kingdutch: you update node with npm?
[14:00] Kingdutch: no
[14:00] Kingdutch: nvm != npm

[14:03] johnnyboy: wtf did i get into a stephen king novel?
[14:03] DrMcKay: Kingdutch: you could just install one node version globally (the version you'll be using to run a script)
[14:03] DrMcKay: Kingdutch: where does it throw it? code?
[14:04] Kingdutch: fs.writeFile(outFile, xml, function (err) {
[14:04] Kingdutch: that's what I narrowed it down to
[14:04] Kingdutch: Although it doesn't actually tell me
[14:04] Kingdutch: at fs.js:476:51
[14:04] Kingdutch: is the outermost error line I get
[14:05] DrMcKay: Kingdutch: node version?
[14:05] Kingdutch: 0.4.9
[14:05] isufy has left the channel
[14:06] DrMcKay: so it's about data parameter
[14:06] DrMcKay: wait, no
[14:06] DrMcKay: no
[14:06] Raynos: why dont we have access to the scope object anymore?
[14:07] DrMcKay: it's probably in Buffer constructor
[14:07] Raynos: Where are module local variables stored?
[14:07] Kingdutch: Apparantly my xml is empty
[14:07] isufy has joined the channel
[14:07] boehm has joined the channel
[14:07] TheJH: Raynos, uhm, what? Local variables aren't on an object
[14:07] TheJH: Raynos, at least I'm pretty sure
[14:07] Raynos: TheJH: they used to be on module
[14:07] Raynos: If you declare a variable inside a module. In the browser it would be written to window.
[14:08] DrMcKay: Kingdutch: line you got it on is weird: https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/v0.4.9/lib/buffer.js#L176
[14:08] Raynos: In node it used to be written to module
[14:08] Raynos: It allowed for some nice meta programming :( apparently this feature was removed
[14:08] DrMcKay: Kingdutch: parent may have some getter
[14:08] e6nian has joined the channel
[14:08] DrMcKay: Kingdutch: nah

[14:09] isufy has joined the channel
[14:09] Yoric has joined the channel
[14:09] TheJH: Raynos, there's a hidden closure around each module, so that can't be, I think
[14:09] DrMcKay: Kingdutch: I don't know, that may be some issue. verify that your script uses valid data
[14:10] Raynos: TheJH: How do I meta program it? :(
[14:10] TheJH: Raynos, every script gets wraped in (function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {...});
[14:10] TheJH: *wrapped
[14:10] e6nian: when I build node.js from source with tag v0.4.11, AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'id' ...then. make Error
[14:10] DrMcKay: e6nian: some problem with build system
[14:10] TheJH: Raynos, attach your variables to an object or so? depends on your needs. what do you want to do?
[14:10] DrMcKay: what are you building on?
[14:10] e6nian: macosx
[14:11] DrMcKay: e6nian: paste log to gist

[14:13] TheJH: Raynos, why not `exports["create"+name]`?
[14:13] TheJH: Raynos, even `exports[name]` should work
[14:13] e6nian: DrMcKay: http://pastebin.com/vu84xM8g 
[14:13] Raynos: TheJH: because I use the create functions in my script aswell.
[14:13] e6nian: thank you
[14:13] DrMcKay: oh, metaprogramming in node.js?
[14:13] DrMcKay: might be cool for a blog post
[14:13] mcluskydodallas has joined the channel
[14:14] Raynos: DrMcKay: we can't meta program with variables anymore
[14:14] TheJH: Raynos, uhm, how is that relevant?
[14:14] Raynos: TheJH because then I have to reference them as export.createBatch rather then createBatch
[14:14] Raynos: its less elegant
[14:14] TheJH: Raynos, you can use both
[14:14] TheJH: Raynos, you're currently attaching them to exports anyway
[14:14] Raynos: Anything written to exports I can use as a local variable?
[14:15] e6nian: DrMcKay: any idea about that?
[14:15] kenperkins has joined the channel
[14:15] TheJH: Raynos, ah, wait, you want the code at the top instead of the code at the bottom?
[14:15] DrMcKay: e6nian: seems to be this issue with waf: http://code.google.com/p/waf/issues/detail?id=451
[14:15] Raynos: yes
[14:15] Raynos: The code at the top is supposed to remove the code at the bottom

[14:17] galaxywatcher has joined the channel
[14:18] TheJH: Raynos, ah, I think that what you're trying could work in a somehow altered form if you tell node to activate the context load thing
[14:18] Raynos: context load thing?
[14:18] e6nian: DrMcKay: not like that, I'm on macosx ,not windows
[14:18] DrMcKay: Kingdutch: you have nvm user in the system?
[14:18] Raynos: I just want to programatically
[14:18] Kingdutch: I got it solved
[14:18] Raynos: inject module local variables using strings
[14:18] TheJH: Raynos, set the environment variable NODE_MODULE_CONTEXTS to 1
[14:18] Raynos: without using eval
[14:18] Kingdutch: Had to add write permissions to the parent folder for the group ; )
[14:19] Kingdutch: nvm in this case was nevermind
[14:19] Kingdutch: :P
[14:19] TheJH: Raynos, then attach stuff to "global"
[14:20] DrMcKay: e6nian: e6nian: are you building on a network drive?
[14:20] Raynos: TheJH: Are there any downsides to this?
[14:20] maushu has joined the channel
[14:21] e6nian: DrMcKay: no
[14:21] e6nian: DrMcKay: maybe my python env ?
[14:21] TheJH: Raynos, only if some modules don't respect the "don't attach stuff to the global object" convention
[14:22] Raynos: TheJH: and the whole global.Function !== global.Function
[14:22] Raynos: instanceof checks breaking everywhere
[14:22] Raynos: I use far too much 3rd party code to risk that.
[14:22] TheJH: Raynos, I'm not sure, sorry - I think you'll have to ask someone who knows more about it

[14:41] TheJH: right?
[14:42] TheJH: stephank, actually, I think we could just add a global object "import" or so which is a harmony proxy...
[14:42] stephank: TheJH: Not really, most people store a module in a variable with the same name, as in `var net = require('net');`
[14:43] e6nian: DrMcKay: when I build v0.4.10 last time(weeks ago?),it's ok, but this time , I checkout to v0.4.10, the same error ...
[14:43] Metal3d has joined the channel
[14:44] DrMcKay: e6nian: weird, were you building with the same settings?
[14:44] stephank: TheJH: That doesn't add much. You'd either have to mention it everywhere (`import.net.createServer`) or still more or less explicitely import it (`var net = import.net`)

[14:46] DrMcKay: e6nian: use which to check what version it runs
[14:47] e6nian: DrMcKay: which is ok
[14:47] DrMcKay: e6nian: it uses the same version as before?
[14:47] e6nian: DrMcKay: homebrew installed python 2.7.2

[14:57] Sembiance: ldblackfox: first, in general that's not a good idea. If your looking for an easier way to handle 'Do A, B, C', I highly advise using step: https://github.com/creationix/step    I'd never use node.js without Step
[14:57] DrMcKay: I bet noone of you would break this: http://pastebin.com/XRL5PBXh
[14:57] Sembiance: ldblackfox: but if you absolutely really want to, you can follow some of the links others here will send you :)
[14:57] ldblackfox: Sembiance: TheJH : actually, i'm playing with my init system script, and I must have synchronous call

[14:59] ldblackfox: just take a look at the arch's init scripts

[15:06] TheJH: ldblackfox, and you want which stuff to be async?
[15:06] TheJH: *to be sync
[15:07] ldblackfox: TheJH: filesystem must be mounted before udev start, and to start udev, we must have stuffs executed sync
[15:07] blueadept: ldblackfox: https://github.com/caolan/async
[15:08] blueadept: perhaps you want to go with the waterfall method from this lib
[15:08] TheJH: ldblackfox, but doing everything in serial would slow stuff down, right?
[15:08] TheJH: blueadept, "auto" is better for him
[15:08] blueadept: i use it a lot to mimic synchronous actions
[15:08] TheJH: ldblackfox, try "auto" from the async lib
[15:09] blueadept: ah yeah auto might be better 
[15:09] TheJH: ldblackfox, that allows you to specify dependencies between the commands
[15:09] blueadept: from look at that code snippit
[15:09] ldblackfox: TheJH: OKay, i'll take a look :)
[15:09] ldblackfox: blueadept, TheJH: thx for help :)
[15:10] DrMcKay: does forever restart script when it changes?
[15:10] TheJH: ldblackfox, btw, node-based init looks cool, but you should keep in mind that node has some startup time

[15:12] ldblackfox: TheJH: yes, but in comparison, we lost time for each command call in a bash script, like for "echo"
[15:12] DrMcKay: ldblackfox: make sure all libraries are accessible so that it can correctly run
[15:12] ldblackfox: cause we need te reinit the subprocess
[15:12] ldblackfox: DrMcKay: of course :)
[15:13] DrMcKay: ldblackfox: I would compile it statically to make sure
[15:13] TheJH: ldblackfox, if you also have node scripts for the init scripts, load them into your init process and run them in the same node instance, should be faster

[15:48] catb0t: 5

[15:48] catb0t: undefined
[15:48] DrMcKay: ah, yes, second one doesn't return
[15:48] DrMcKay: eazyigz: esentially, you should use var to let people know where you initialize your variable
[15:49] DrMcKay: eazyigz: but it's matter of coding style
[15:49] eazyigz: DrMcKay: i know that on the client side it matters, right?  But in Node it doesn't...
[15:49] DrMcKay: eazyigz: it does?
[15:50] eazyigz: DrMcKay: to avoid conflicts with globals
[15:50] DrMcKay: eazyigz: oh, yes, in node it's important as well

[16:10] xerox: <xerox> it's very easy to change node version anyway
[16:11] zastaph: ah ok, to change.. i thought you meant reinstall
[16:11] ryanfitz_ has joined the channel
[16:11] xerox: why would you get the unstable version if you are not going to recompile it every once in a while
[16:12] necrodearia has joined the channel
[16:12] zastaph: i followed that guide before and ended up with the unstable version, without knowing it was unstable.. i just thought it was latest
[16:12] xerox: you did something wrong
[16:12] xerox: because that process gets the stable
[16:12] xerox: in particular, the line: git checkout v0.4.11 # optional.  Note that master is unstable.
[16:13] zastaph: i presume npm uninstall <mypackages> -g ... npm uninstall npm -g ... make uninstall is all I need to uninstall everything and try again
[16:13] xerox: that's another pro of using $HOME/.node
[16:13] xerox: rm -rf ~/.node
[16:13] xerox: done :)
[16:13] DrMcKay: xerox: :)
[16:14] DoNaLd`: sudo rm -rf / 
[16:14] DoNaLd`: :)
[16:14] DrMcKay: I think I will build a perl script to automatize it
[16:14] DrMcKay: DoNaLd`: won't work
[16:14] DrMcKay: sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root /
[16:14] zastaph: doesnt rm -rf ~/local/node do something similar

[16:33] xerox: uhm.
[16:33] pr2012: the on connect error, I thought was thrown by clientRequest?
[16:33] DrMcKay: TheJH: guess what it's written in.
[16:33] TheJH: DrMcKay, php or perl?
[16:33] xerox: pr2012: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.10/api/http.html#request.connection
[16:33] DrMcKay: php, of course
[16:34] TheJH: Awww! OMG! From the deflate rfc: "Data elements are packed into bytes in order of increasing bit number within the byte, i.e., starting with the least-significant bit of the byte."
[16:34] DrMcKay: TheJH: my head is full of fuck now.
[16:35] TheJH: that means I have to flip all the bytes around in order to get something useful in a binary-data-viewer
[16:35] TheJH: GAH!
[16:35] soapyillusions has joined the channel
[16:35] TheJH: who'd do such a thing?

[16:36] DrMcKay: oh! I was able to parse that RFC fragment correctly!
[16:36] DrMcKay: I feel so smart now.
[16:36] TheJH: wait. "Data elements other than Huffman codes are packed starting with the least-significant bit of the data element."
[16:37] DrMcKay: :D
[16:37] TheJH: that's a DOUBLE-FLIP, but at different offsets, so it doesn't equal out
[16:37] TheJH: FLIP, MOVE, FLIP
[16:37] TheJH: GAAAH!
[16:37] TheJH: I feel like I have to go into ##crypto now for help with gzip. *sigh*

[16:38] TheJH: meh
[16:38] TheJH: seriously, someone had too much time for inventing crappy stuff
[16:39] DrMcKay: TheJH: do you still find it interesting ;> ?

[16:40] indutny: ryah++
[16:40] catb0t: ryah now has 1 beer
[16:40] TheJH: DrMcKay, in some weird way, yes
[16:40] v8bot_:  indutny has given a beer to ryah. ryah now has 1 beers.
[16:40] aho: there are probably 500 copies of zlib on my machine :>
[16:40] rgl has joined the channel
[16:40] TheJH: uh? openssl from chrome? what did node use for ssl before that monstercommit?
[16:41] indutny: ryah: that's most important commit for last few months (for me)
[16:41] aho: it's in every browser, image viewer, game, emulator, ftp client, whatever
[16:41] ian-london has left the channel
[16:41] TheJH: meh, my browser hangs
[16:41] indutny: TheJH: openssl shared lib
[16:41] indutny: TheJH: and chrome is using new version of openssl
[16:41] TheJH: indutny, what about windows or nodejs hosters?
[16:41] indutny: TheJH: with blackjack and NPN
[16:41] indutny: TheJH: I think chrome compiles on windows
[16:42] heavysixer has joined the channel
[16:42] indutny: TheJH: Anyway having openssl bundled into node's source is very cool for hosting too

[16:46] TheJH: aho, ah, ok. but still, node hosting

[16:46] TheJH: :D
[16:47] torsd has joined the channel
[16:47] aho: dunno how node hosting works in detail, but i don't see a reason why zlib shouldn't work there too
[16:48] aho: i mean there are some npm module thingies which require native libs, right?
[16:48] gazumps has joined the channel
[16:49] mikeal has joined the channel
[16:50] TheJH: aho, yes, e.g. nodejitsu told me "native stuff is ok, but you have to include the c libraries in your package"...
[16:50] DrMcKay: TheJH: I think it's about compiling the stuff
[16:50] TheJH: aho, so I'd either need an npm package with that included or I'd have to fiddle around in node_modules
[16:51] TheJH: DrMcKay, no, they explicitely allow compiling
[16:51] DrMcKay: many hostings don't allow compiler access
[16:51] TheJH: DrMcKay, they do, the devs told me in #nodejitsu

[17:34] DrMcKay: TheJH: I got it working, though I had to increase interval

[17:49] DrMcKay: since parameter is garbled

[20:49] DrMcKay: what arch uses by default?
[20:49] ldblackfox: later i'll replace rc.multi (which launch daemons)
[20:49] ldblackfox: DrMcKay: about what?
[20:49] ldblackfox: the configuration?
[20:50] TheJH: just coded a tool that can, given a number of people and a groupsize that's a prime, calculate a bunch of groups so that everyone sees each other person exactly once. if the number of people is the result of a multiplication of the groupsize with a natural number, the group also always have the same size. should I put it on github/nodejitsu or so?

[20:51] DrMcKay: ldblackfox: is it systemd or what?
[20:51] ldblackfox: actually not systemd; but you can use it
[20:51] DrMcKay: TheJH: patent it!
[20:52] DrMcKay: TheJH: sure, upload, might get useful :)
[20:52] TheJH: DrMcKay, it's 21 lines of coffeescript :D
[20:52] TheJH: but the idea is cool: spinning wheels
[20:52] ldblackfox: DrMcKay: a classic init script system.
[20:52] DrMcKay: well, some guy patented linked list
[20:52] TheJH: DrMcKay, are you SERIOUS?

[21:04] kenperkins: doesn't if (cb) return true in any "is something" case, including when it's not a function
[21:04] AvianFlu: if (!callback) { return new Error('Stop treating me like a synchronous function!') }
[21:05] DrMcKay: kenperkins: it returns false when it's null or undefined, it's enough
[21:05] TheJH: AvianFlus users have to care :D
[21:05] kenperkins: unless your arguments get screwed up (which happens more often with js than strongly typed languages)
[21:06] kenperkins: speaking of which, do you guys use anything to "compile" your js, and do things like signature checks
[21:06] AvianFlu: var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)
[21:06] TheJH: kenperkins, I think I published a library on npm that does signature checks at runtime based on comments
[21:07] TheJH: kenperkins, or wait, I think I only published the hungarian magic one...
[21:08] TheJH: kenperkins, http://search.npmjs.org/#/hungarian-magic and https://github.com/thejh/node-hungarian-magic for hungarian magic
[21:08] DrMcKay: hungarian notation? somebody uses it?
[21:08] TheJH: DrMcKay, for type checking :D

[23:09] tuhoojabotti: How does one optimize assembly over time?
[23:09] daed: well
[23:09] daed: the JVM continuously optimizes
[23:09] tuhoojabotti: v8 optimizes with hidden classes

[23:13] arlolra: SubStack: sorry to bug. https://gist.github.com/1159816
[23:13] daed: awesome.
[23:13] chrisdickinson: so lookups turn into 'oh here's an attribute, look it up and get an integer offset into the memory mapped attribute list, pull attribute from memory map'. at least as i understand it.
[23:14] tuhoojabotti: chrisdickinson: No need to understand it, just dial with it.
[23:14] FearOfMusic: anyone here using calipso?
[23:14] chrisdickinson: (and, if i'm not completely mistaken, instances of the class can use that hidden class and avoid doing the prototype-chain-lookup dance at each attribute lookup)
[23:15] tuhoojabotti: chrisdickinson: It takes 3 steps, 1 ignores 2 creastes the hidden class and 3 just looks it up there.

[23:16] daed: ZOMG PYTHONG.
[23:16] tuhoojabotti: ACTION hides
[23:16] chrisdickinson: actually, python + gevent = not bad
[23:16] daed: haha i didn't list python for a reason
[23:16] zackattack: pythong sounds like the name of a Male Strip Club.
[23:16] daed: yu0p
[23:17] daed: i'm not sure whether to be disgused or turned on
[23:17] daed: or both.
[23:17] tuhoojabotti: I use a python bot, which I have created some modules for.

[23:17] eazyigz: I am using jQuery's $.each in node.js.  Is there a way to find out when $.each finished?
[23:17] tuhoojabotti: eazyigz: when(each).do()
[23:17] tuhoojabotti: Or something like that. :P
[23:18] tuhoojabotti: when().done()
[23:18] tuhoojabotti: that's what I do. :D
[23:18] AAA_awright: eazyigz: It's synchronous
[23:19] eazyigz: tuhoojabotti: when(each) is valid in node.js?
[23:19] tuhoojabotti: No idea.
[23:19] eazyigz: AAA_awright: so?
[23:19] Ratty_: Node uses a lot of ANSI colours, is there a module to make it easy to output them in my own stuff?
[23:19] AAA_awright: eazyigz: So, it's done after the call to .each is made
[23:19] tuhoojabotti: Ratty_: I use colors module.
[23:19] tuhoojabotti: Yeah
[23:19] robotmay has joined the channel
[23:20] eazyigz: AAA_awright: nothing in node.js is guaranteed to execute in a particular order
[23:20] tuhoojabotti: $.each(...); done();
[23:20] Ratty_: I'll take a look at that. Ta
[23:20] mikekunze has joined the channel
[23:20] eazyigz: so my function may execute before .each is finished!
[23:20] AAA_awright: eazyigz: Unless jQuery somehow learned Node.js and is adding callbacks to the event loop, everything jQuery does is synchronous
[23:20] tuhoojabotti: Yes.
[23:21] tuhoojabotti: Ratty_: https://github.com/marak/colors.js
[23:21] Ratty_: ooh sexy
[23:21] chrisdickinson: AAA_awright: both node.js and in-browser share an api for adding things to the event loop.
[23:21] tuhoojabotti: Ratty_: It is!
[23:21] jesusabdullah: Colors is a lot of fun
[23:21] chrisdickinson: v8: setTimeout(function() { console.log(1) }, 0);
[23:21] v8bot_: chrisdickinson: ReferenceError: setTimeout is not defined
[23:21] daed: makes me wonder if coffeescript makes both node and ruby devs want to kill themselves
[23:21] chrisdickinson: well. it's defined in node, at least :)

[23:22] tuhoojabotti: ew
[23:22] daed: slow down.
[23:22] chrisdickinson: i think i'm back to liking javascript better, but coffeescript isn't bad.
[23:22] daed: let's just SLOW DOWN now.

[23:22] daed: js+python+ruby is just awkward (but kind of sexy)
[23:24] chrisdickinson: daed: it reads and writes nicely, and avoids a lot of really uncomfortably common pitfalls.
[23:24] AAA_awright: chrisdickinson: The browser just provides some APIs that are asyncronous, there's no (exposed) concept of an event loop. None of them are natively implemented in Node.js, like XMLHttpRequest
[23:24] daed: i agree
[23:24] daed: but there are always purists

[23:24] secoif has joined the channel
[23:24] jesusabdullah: Naw, I think they're all just different things that different people like
[23:24] chrisdickinson: AAA_awright: setTimeout is exposed in both.
[23:24] eazyigz: tuhoojabotti: $.each is i/o bound, and so done() executes before .each
[23:24] daed: nexxy last night was a purist.
[23:24] chrisdickinson: And can be used like process.nextTick
[23:24] jesusabdullah: You get *really* attached to things when you work with them every day
[23:24] daed: whoa, she's here
[23:24] tuhoojabotti: eazyigz: That's why I used when().done()
[23:25] H4ns``` has joined the channel
[23:25] AAA_awright: chrisdickinson: it's window.setTimeout in the browser
[23:25] tuhoojabotti: But somehow my script also works each();callback(); style in node
[23:25] eazyigz: tuhoojabott: I'm trying to understand how .done() is executed on when()
[23:25] chrisdickinson: AAA_awright: everything on window is globally available.
[23:25] daed: that teapot page hypnotized me.
[23:25] AAA_awright: That's not guarenteed that I'm aware of
[23:25] jesusabdullah: YOU're here!
[23:26] tuhoojabotti: daed: It's pure css. :D
[23:26] daed: holy shit
[23:26] chrisdickinson: AAA_awright: it's pretty guaranteed. the minimum resolution of setTimeout isn't.
[23:26] AAA_awright: But yes, if jQuery used setTimeout then that qualifies as async
[23:26] chrisdickinson: (sorry to be pedantic) 
[23:27] ryan[WIN] has joined the channel
[23:28] daed: is writing node.js code in coffeescript similar to interracial porn?
[23:28] daed: trying to find analogues.
[23:29] chrisdickinson: daed: basically re: coffeescript, if all javascript was written for V8, i'd forget about coffeescript. but since JScript exists, I see some utility to coffeescript.
[23:29] chrisdickinson: ACTION has a coffeescript orm for node :\
[23:29] daed: hmm
[23:29] daed: whoa
[23:29] chrisdickinson: https://github.com/chrisdickinson/ormnomnom
[23:29] daed: ORMNOM NOM NOM
[23:29] chrisdickinson: just to be totally unpopular -- it's for SQL, it's an ORM, and it's in Coffeescript.
[23:29] daed: still have to explicitly define the model though?
[23:30] daed: i.e. all fields
[23:30] chrisdickinson: daed: ormnomnom takes the django approach and treats your model as the canonical representation of your data.
[23:30] daed: ahh ok
[23:30] AAA_awright: Or, just write ECMAScript and convert it to whatever mutliated buggy interpertations there are
[23:30] maushu_: Hmm, no dlopen for Windows? :(
[23:30] daed: similar to datamapper then?
[23:31] daed: hmm
[23:31] chrisdickinson: ACTION peers at datamapper
[23:31] daed: i see Schema.meta
[23:31] chrisdickinson: (sorry, I'm from python-land.)
[23:31] daed: i did a lot in python, but never any ORM
[23:32] daed: this is pretty fascinating
[23:32] Sembiance: omg I love node.js it's just so... efficient!
[23:32] daed: i feel like i'm on mtv live right now
[23:32] Nexxy: ACTION scoffs @ the current conversation topic
[23:32] chrisdickinson: daed: thanks / good catch on the `Schema.meta`. It should be `Section.meta`. Just fixed that

Then if I call require('connect') it works.  If I npm rm connect, then git clone the connect repository and go into that directory and run npm link it creates a symbolic link to connect on my local machine, but require('connect') does not work.

[23:57] chrisdickinson: ah -- i'd look at http://expressjs.com/guide.html#req.param()
[23:58] chrisdickinson: i guess it's looking for the parameter 'method', either from the matched url, GET params, or the POST params.
[23:59] ggg: matched url?
