[00:00] isaacs: however, you can pre-compile it on all of them, and then have a main script that loads the right own
[00:00] isaacs: *one
[00:00] creationix: isaacs: how would it load the right one?
[00:00] tim_smart: mrryanjohnston: Across all the boards, because the event loop can't guarantee it will call your callback exactly x ms after you called setTimeout

[00:00] creationix: if the require function would just ignore addons that aren't the native architecture, that would be enough
[00:00] tiemonster has joined the channel
[00:00] creationix: it could fall through to the parent folder's node_modules
[00:00] isaacs: creationix: "if"
[00:00] tim_smart: mrryanjohnston: So it could 1004 ms after you called `setTimeout(myTimeout, 1000)`
[00:00] tim_smart: *could be
[00:00] jesusabdullah: Nuck: You could use a sexier url for that countdown. stylings look pretty snazzy though imo
[00:01] isaacs: creationix: the fact is, it doens't, and that's kind of an involved change to the api
[00:01] tjholowaychuk: creationix / isaacs the ajaxorg guys did similar with their canvas thing
[00:01] creationix: isaacs: how hard can that be? it would involve any user facing api changes
[00:01] isaacs: it'd be nice, but it needs thought and planning to be applied.

[00:02] creationix: isaacs: no
[00:02] Nuck: :3 This is great.
[00:02] isaacs: magic should be added carefully, minimally, and with great trepidation
[00:02] creationix: if I require('goo.node') and "node_modules/goo.node" is arm, but I'm in i686, then ignore it and find the one in "../node_modules/goo.node"

[00:04] jesusabdullah: BE A MAN
[00:04] isaacs: creationix: the os.arch() function got added in 0.5
[00:04] creationix: tjholowaychuk: so they use a modified node?

[00:04] mrryanjohnston: tim_smart: ah, kay.
[00:05] Nuck: jesusabdullah: I think I'll set it up to toss onto a Redis instance, so I can learn that too :P
[00:05] creationix: isaacs: you really think it's magical to ignore invalid addons
[00:05] Nuck: I learned basics of socket.io with this :P
[00:05] jesusabdullah: word
[00:05] Nuck: Very nice, very simple, I love it.

[00:10] Nuck: tiemonster: It can, it's just not one of the things Node is best for
[00:10] chjj: tiemonster: it is, but you have to implement it at the http level yourself
[00:11] creationix: tjholowaychuk: I see, thanks
[00:11] tiemonster: Nuck:  it just seems dumb to run a separate nginx process just to serve up the static files for an app...
[00:11] isaacs: tiemonster: why's that dumb?  nginx is great at serving static files
[00:11] jesusabdullah: v8> array(5).join(",")

[00:11] Nuck: I think that's actually a great plan
[00:11] tiemonster: I'm guessing that it hasn't made it into connect for the reasons mentioned here: http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs/browse_thread/thread/479e1e5de272931d/d2f7bfaffc0d01e8?lnk=gst&q=sendfile#d2f7bfaffc0d01e8

[00:12] v8bot_: jesusabdullah: "THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST "
[00:12] Nuck: Pretty sure that's inherited from Connect
[00:12] tiemonster: yeah, but it uses the stream API
[00:12] chjj: Nuck: hes talking about sendfile

[00:13] tiemonster: chjj:  really? on github?
[00:14] chjj: tiemonster: yeah, its tightly coupled with my framework though, you might do better to look at tim smart's middleware collection, it was partially based on his implementation and peter griess' example
[00:14] tiemonster: I would think that would be comparable in speed to nginx

[00:15] tiemonster: how can a middleware be tightly coupled? isn't that the whole point of middleware? :-)
[00:15] chjj: i think people have done benchmarks, its still not as fast as nginx, but its much faster than using node streams
[00:15] tiemonster: I might do my own and see
[00:15] chjj: tiemonster: yeah, its not actually middleware, i lied, i keep my static file server function kind of internal and then layer a middleware on top of it, its the one thing i do backwards

[00:17] tiemonster: ooh - found this: https://gist.github.com/702695
[00:17] Nuck: And while Node can provide a way to deal with binary data, it isn't perfect
[00:18] jesusabdullah: wait wait wait
[00:18] Nuck: Generally a server like Nginx will be better simply because it lacks overhead from the Js layer, etc.
[00:18] lime_ has joined the channel
[00:18] jesusabdullah: Bennito: what do you mean by "node application server" ?
[00:18] chjj: tiemonster: that wont work, you need to set up an io watcher and handle EAGAIN

[00:19] lime_: I have node.js running on hostmonster, but I am unable to access my site once I do `node server.js`
[00:19] jesusabdullah: lime_: Does it work locally? If not, maybe it's a problem with hostmonster
[00:19] lime_: I have it set up on port 1337, and the server starts, but I'm unable to acesss the site at domain:1337.org
[00:20] Bennito: jesusabdullah: https://github.com/nodejitsu/haibu
[00:20] jesusabdullah: lime_: domain.org:1337

[00:20] lime_: yeah sorry not thinking :D
[00:20] maushu: Great, updating node broke something.
[00:20] chjj: lime_: do you have some kind of firewall setup? did you forward port 1337?
[00:21] jesusabdullah: Bennito: I guess my thinking is that haibu and nginx solve different problems entirely. nginx is a fast webserver that just, y'know, serves stuff,,, whereas haibu does a bunch of stuff to "wrap" node.js apps

[00:22] chjj: jesusabdullah: i think its overrated, id rather keep things simple and just use node if i can
[00:23] Bennito: jesusabdullah: So the best thing is to use both?

[00:29] chjj: lime_: do you have root access? etc
[00:29] khrome: anyone using mootools under node?
[00:29] Daegalus: Any of you know how to run multiple? I would like a few for multiple projects
[00:29] lime_: Its a website server, and no I don't appear to root acess.
[00:29] Marak: Daegalus: you should just be able to set the port
[00:29] Marak: Daegalus: whats the issue?
[00:29] chjj: lime_: well then, you cant kill those processes anyway most likely
[00:29] Daegalus: Well, I would have to change the script, launchone, change the script again, launch, etc.
[00:30] chjj: lime_: if thats a shared webhost theyre probably reverse proxying requests to all those processes
[00:30] chjj: lime_: you would probably need to specifically request them to set it up for node for you

[01:09] bnoordhuis: v3ctR: the other thread cannot be inside the event loop at that time
[01:09] bnoordhuis: v3ctR: if it wakes up, it'll trash those aforementioned internal structures
[01:10] bnoordhuis: v3ctR: so if you want to keep it simple, stick to a single event / single thread model for now

[01:17] brianseeders has joined the channel
[01:17] v3ctR: bnoordhuis: will those pipes not need an event loop too?
[01:18] bnoordhuis: v3ctR: you add the pipe to the event loop
[01:19] bnoordhuis: v3ctR: then, when you want javascript to wake up the main thread, you write some data to it

[01:28] v3ctR: bnoordhuis: are there any examples of that so i can learn from it instead of annoying you...

[01:30] tiemonster: I have to go read now
[01:31] Brandon_R: what were you working on?

[01:41] blup has joined the channel

[02:04] dscape: whats the underlying data structure?
[02:04] Ratty_: dscape: what is there to implement?
[02:04] jerrysv: brokenjames: i'm not, but this probably isn't the venue to be discussing awk :)

[02:04] brokenjames: hehe
[02:05] dscape: just knowing something works is not always enough

[02:22] zemanel: i see
[02:23] Ratty_: dscape: erm ok.
[02:23] Marak: hook.io creates a distributed node.js EventEmitter that works cross-process / cross-platform / cross-browser. Think of it like a real-time event bus that works anywhere JavaScript is supported.
[02:23] Marak: You create custom i/o scenarios by picking and choosing from an extensive library of tiny, independent, autonomous "hooks" that seamlessly work together.

[02:40] mrryanjohnston: Nuck: well, it IS open source, afterall ;) you know, you could :3

[03:09] Nuck: skunkape: Ah, that makes more sense then :D
[03:09] Nexxy: interpret it how you like, but ORMs exist far beyond simply mapping objects to Relational databases
[03:09] Nuck: Nexxy: Yes, a different meaning of ORM, obviously.
[03:09] Nexxy: ah, yes that must be it.
[03:09] Nexxy: forgive me.

[03:32] vicapow: AvianFlu: i could expect that output aswell. but it's not what I'm getting.
[03:32] Stephen: AvianFlu: id1 and id2 are Number objects
[03:32] Stephen: As 2 different object instances, they are not equal
[03:33] AvianFlu: so what's he supposed to do there then
[03:33] vicapow: Stephen: what are they then?
[03:33] vicapow: Stephen: are they just objects that override toString ?
[03:33] vicapow: i guess i should cast them to strings before comparing
[03:34] Stephen: Use toString for a string, or parseInt if you need numbers
[03:34] Stephen: parseInt(id1) == parseInt(id2)
[03:34] vicapow: Stephen: yes!!
[03:34] vicapow: it works now

[04:25] DTrejo: kfalter: what kind of auth should I be thinking about hehe
[04:25] vikstrous: polotek: Okay, thanks.
[04:26] kfalter: good. looking into auth options. don't wanna do hook.io for http issues, don't wanna do red is because of the token passing and I'm not into that, and then supposed marak has a cookie lib? that i have been unable to find
[04:26] kfalter: redis*
[04:26] kfalter: supposedly*
[04:27] DTrejo: oh umm
[04:27] Marak: kfalter: its just a middle-ware, nothing special
[04:27] DTrejo: well in the past I've been able to avoid this issue
[04:27] DTrejo: for the most part
[04:27] Marak: i dont even know if its in a working state
[04:27] kfalter: marak: yeah paolo said it was super simple
[04:27] kfalter: yeah
[04:27] Marak: https://github.com/marak/session.js
[04:27] Marak: connect has one too
[04:27] Marak: same idea
[04:27] kfalter: dtrejo: how do you avoid it 
[04:28] kfalter: marak: any other suggestions 
[04:28] DTrejo: by building sites without auth ;)
[04:28] kfalter: haha right hah forgot about that. 
[04:28] Marak: kfalter: id fork session.js and use it, i think we are gonna move it to a new repo as part of this other thing
[04:28] Marak: im not sure
[04:28] Marak: there is also the connect one, which probably sucks in some way
[04:28] tmzt_: session.js is for express/connect?
[04:29] Marak: tmzt_: works for whatever man
[04:29] Marak: i dont discriminate
[04:29] Marak: its just req/res handling
[04:29] DTrejo: i foresee a future marak, in which no one understands req/res handling
[04:29] Marak: simple code, you can role your own easily
[04:29] tmzt_: have redis support?
[04:29] Marak: DTrejo: ok?
[04:29] DTrejo: (also, hi)
[04:30] Marak: tmzt_: the backend is memory, you can just pipe that shit to wherever
[04:30] evanmeagher has joined the channel
[04:30] DTrejo: no, just b/c as node gets more popular they'll be less comfy with that sorta thing b/c they always use something that babies them, like express or whatnot
[04:31] evanmeagher has left the channel
[04:31] kfalter: babies. yes… haha or makes it more accessible. you choose :)

[05:39] amigojapan has joined the channel
[05:39] Nuck: isaqual: Did you put a startup script in package.json?
[05:39] isaqual: Nuck: I did
[05:40] Nuck: isaqual: Try running that directly
[05:40] Nuck: I have trouble with package.json too :P
[05:40] Nuck: Well, the use of start scripts
[05:40] isaqual: Nuck: Like where ? :)
[05:40] slloyd_ has joined the channel
[05:40] Nuck: isaqual: Whatever you put in the start thing in package.json?
[05:40] Nuck: The starting point for your app
[05:41] Nuck: wait.
[05:41] isaqual: Nuck: Iäm currently trying that.. :/
[05:42] Nuck: isaqual: You DO realize that require() isn't part of NPM, right?
[05:42] Nuck: That's Node.js
[05:42] isaqual: Good point! 
[05:42] Nuck: isaqual: If it's tossing an error, paste it onto gist.github.com :D
[05:42] isaqual: Do I need to write own npm handler for that  ?
[05:42] Nuck: ... what?
[05:43] Nuck: isaqual: NPM is a package manager.  It installs modules so that you can access them in Node
[05:43] isaqual: Nuck: Maybe I will paste some error ;)
[05:43] Nuck: npm start merely executes whatever is in your package.json's "start" field (not executing in Node, actually literally executing in the shell)
[05:43] misterm has joined the channel
[05:44] Nuck: npm start is probably the low point of NPM.
[05:45] Nuck: It's entering territory it probably shouldn't be entering, and it's not all that well-designed, since it can't just handle a path to a JS file
[05:47] isaqual: Nuck: I just get some generic npm error and when trying to execute straigt my app.js I get "Cannot find module 'express@2.2.2'"
[05:47] Acolyte has joined the channel
[05:47] Nuck: isaqual: Did you do require('express@2.2.2')?
[05:47] Nuck: If so, you're doing it wrong :P
[05:47] Nuck: First you npm install express@2.2.2
[05:47] isaqual: Yes I Did :D
[05:47] Nuck: Then you require('express')
[05:48] Nuck: npm installs a version
[05:48] Nuck: And Node just looks for whatever
[05:48] captain_morgan has joined the channel
[05:48] Acolyte: is it possible to modify routes during runtime?
[05:48] isaqual: but It is installed to npm_modules directory already :) 
[05:48] Nuck: isaqual: Well that's also wrong
[05:48] Nuck: It's node_modules
[05:48] Croms has joined the channel
[05:48] isaqual: correct
[05:48] Nuck: isaqual: NPM just installs it into node_modules
[05:49] Nuck: Then you require('nameOfModule')
[05:49] Nuck: You do not put the version there
[05:49] Nuck: So no @2.2.2
[05:49] Nuck: Node doesn't know how to handle that
[05:49] isaqual: gist! :D
[05:49] Nuck: isaqual: Gist your code ;)

[05:51] tomtomaso has joined the channel
[05:52] ravi_ has joined the channel
[05:53] Acolyte: is it possible to modify routes during runtime or is it sort of not 'endorsed'?

[05:54] Nuck: Acolyte: In Express?
[05:54] Nuck: You probably should avoid it
[05:54] Acolyte: Nuck: or any other module
[05:55] Acolyte: Nuck: I am looking for a way to restrict access to certain routes based on user access level
[05:55] isaqual: Nuck: You were right, without @versionnumber requirements :)
[05:55] Nuck: Acolyte: Each routing framework has its own concepts.  Some may fully endorse that, others may not.
[05:55] Nuck: Acolyte: Then return a 504 if they're not allowed, using connect-session

[05:56] Nuck: isaqual: If anything ever suggested that, they need to be shot.
[05:56] Nuck: Because I've been here since 0.2.6, and that's never been that way.  I remember pre-NPM.
[05:57] isaqual: Nuck: :D
[05:57] Nuck: Before the upper 0.1.x's there was no require, either
[05:57] Nuck: Or some time around then
[05:57] isaqual: Nuck: But big thanks for you!:) I have been stuck with this too long :/
[05:57] Nuck: Not sure on the details, it was either late 0.1.x or the start of 0.2.x
[05:58] Nuck: isaqual: heh, it's an understandable mistake when dealing with NPM and Node.

[06:06] vidi: setTimeout(function(){console.log('.')}, 100)
[06:06] Nuck: Works in 0.4.10?
[06:06] vidi: at different scope
[06:06] vidi: haven't tried it in 4.10
[06:07] Nuck: haven't upgraded to 0.4.11

[06:08] SubStack: it was hectic as fuck from 0.1 through 0.3
[06:08] Nuck: SubStack: Who doesn't?
[06:08] SubStack: you'd have to upgrade all the time to use modules on npm
[06:08] Nuck: SubStack: Even in 0.3.x it was pretty hectic
[06:08] Nuck: Up until about 0.3.6 or so
[06:08] Nuck: Actually, did 0.3.x go any further than that?
[06:09] Nuck: SubStack: I'm sure the biggest jump was when require() got added, huh?
[06:09] Nuck: Wasn't that in 0.1.x?

[06:20] vidi: it does
[06:21] vidi: and then i put setTimeout(function(){console.log('.')}, 100)
[06:21] Nuck: Now THAT is odd.
[06:21] vidi: at a place that works
[06:21] vidi: and setInterval runs
[06:21] Nuck: hmm
[06:21] Nuck: That's odd behavior
[06:21] vidi: its definitely a bug
[06:21] Nuck: It might be a quirk in JS itself though :V

[06:24] Nuck: lol
[06:24] Nuck: AAA_awright: That's an odd thing to lack
[06:24] Nuck: I always just assumed it was part of JS
[06:24] AAA_awright: I would think not
[06:24] AAA_awright: It's an API like DOM is after all
[06:25] Nuck: AAA_awright: True, but many of the features in ECMAScript 5 are too :P
[06:25] Nuck: It's treading into some very API-ish territory nowadays

[07:07] v8bot_: Nuck: RangeError: toString() radix argument must be between 2 and 36
[07:07] Nuck: lol
[07:07] Nuck: so, it doesn't go above 36 :P
[07:09] shiawuen: nice to know
[07:09] shiawuen: but 36 is more than enough for common use
[07:10] fangel has joined the channel
[07:10] Nuck: shiawuen: Thats 0-9 and a-z with no case-sensitivity
[07:11] Nuck: So 0 through...
[07:11] Nuck: v8: "zzzzzz".toInt(36)
[07:11] v8bot_: Nuck: TypeError: Object zzzzzz has no method 'toInt'

[07:12] shiawuen: there is a base 64 version iirc
[07:12] Nuck: base64 is easy with buffers
[07:13] jetienne_ has joined the channel

[07:19] shiawuen: oh…lets spawn some hotmail account and subscribe to github and watch it
[07:19] shiawuen: just kidding :P
[07:20] Marak: ive forced people to watch projects on github before
[07:20] Marak: got 3,000 watchers in ~2 minutes
[07:20] Marak: they dont like that
[07:20] bergie has joined the channel
[07:20] Nuck: Marak: Get us these 1021 watchers :P

[07:32] Orion-: I have an issue with a repl.js someone gave me here. When I run a script with the repl I don't get same results as without the repl. Is is supposed to do so ?

[07:40] Nuck: shiawuen: Node Version Manager?
[07:40] Nuck: I don't use one lol
[07:40] a_suenami has joined the channel
[07:40] Nuck: I use Node + NPM
[07:40] Nuck: And just build whenever I need to update
[07:40] shiawuen: but some library required lower version of node
[07:40] shiawuen: ah! kind of annoying 
[07:41] shiawuen: duh…seem this way works best
[07:41] keyvan: hope this is OK http://cl.ly/2r3e1X3F1X3t2D1E0t3Z
[07:42] Nuck: I wonder if you could create a node version manager in Node, by making it build to another folder, then using another script through the newly-built node version to replace the old one
[07:43] aidalgol has left the channel
[07:43] keyvan: no reason you couldn't. 
[07:44] radiodario has joined the channel
[07:44] Nuck: keyvan: Well, most Node Version Managers are in Python or other languages
[07:44] shiawuen: could steal the way that rvm works, but I dunno how 
[07:44] Nuck: Because it's hard to build something to replace its own environment
[07:44] Nuck: Pulling itself up by its own bootstraps, so to speak
[07:44] Nuck: keyvan: Also, that is badass.
[07:45] keyvan: the link worked for u? it appeared to me like cloudapp is dead
[07:45] keyvan: Nuck: i'm afraid that now people arent gonna draw shit anymore haha
[07:45] Nuck: Worked fine
[07:45] Nuck: How'd you do that?
[07:45] Nuck: Did you just pull up console and force the canvas in?
[07:46] keyvan: this site takes an image and generates a bunch of javascript code, modified it to grab the canvas element 
[07:46] keyvan: http://lab.abhinayrathore.com/img2canvas/
[07:46] Nuck: Ah
[07:46] dsirijus has joined the channel
[07:46] Nuck: keyvan: Or you could just draw the image to the canvas :P
[07:47] keyvan: with drawImage ?
[07:47] Nuck: yeah
[07:47] Nuck: lol
[07:47] Nuck: create an img tag, onload it, then draw that
[07:47] radiodario: just out of curiosity, is there some way to turn a canvas into an image?
[07:47] Nuck: radiodario: Oh, definitely.
[07:47] keyvan: ah yeah i tried it with a url and it didnt work so i did it the other way... could have done it with imgtag created by jquery now that i think of it.
[07:48] fangel has joined the channel
[07:48] Nuck: keyvan: Yup, it just takes an img object
[07:48] radiodario: Nuck: any pointers?
[07:48] Nuck: I think new Image() also works or something liek that
[07:48] Nuck: radiodario: Check MDN?
[07:48] radiodario: cool
[07:48] keyvan: $('canvas')[0].drawImage($('<img src="whatever">')[0],0,0)
[07:48] radiodario: ok and then can it be saved?
[07:48] radiodario: sweet
[07:49] Nuck: radiodario: Well
[07:49] keyvan: now someone make a chrome extension that adds a "paste image from url" to that app :D
[07:49] Nuck: I don't know if the HTML5 File API provided a means for producing a Save dialog >_>
[07:49] Nuck: keyvan: Easier done with a GM script
[07:49] keyvan: oh i had no idea people still used greasemonkey
[07:49] keyvan: havent heard of it in ages
[07:49] nail_: there's some canvas2image lib
[07:49] nail_: mmh
[07:50] nail_: there http://www.nihilogic.dk/labs/canvas2image/ 
[07:50] Nuck: nail_: Or, better yet, just use the raw API
[07:50] Nuck: Because it's easy as fuck
[07:50] Nuck: keyvan: Oh, the GM community still exists.  I still do scripts a lot for deviantART
[07:51] whitman has joined the channel
[07:51] keyvan: v cool

[07:52] Nuck: In fact, I'd argue it's better.
[07:53] Nuck: They have an incredibly centralized bot community, with some amazing bots with beautiful module systems.

[07:53] industrial: SubStack: ping
[07:53] Nuck: I actually got into Node while developing my own deviantART chat bot.
[07:54] keyvan: is this for their web based chat or something?
[07:54] keyvan: i have no idea what chat system they use--if not irc
[07:54] Nuck: keyvan: It's a web based chat system
[07:54] Nuck: Based over sockets
[07:54] keyvan: websockets?
[07:54] Nuck: Server's in C.
[07:54] Nuck: Nah, just sockets
[07:54] Nuck: Using Flash, Java, or XPCOM addon
[07:54] keyvan: oh so theres an actual C client using sockets directly
[07:54] keyvan: err
[07:54] keyvan: server.
[07:54] Nuck: Yup
[07:54] keyvan: but the client is only thru web?
[07:55] keyvan: browser i mean
[07:55] Nuck: Client is actually JS
[07:55] keyvan: right, but how does that communicate
[07:55] Nuck: But they use Flash or Java or an XPCOM plugin to provide the communication layer
[07:55] keyvan: websockets? ajax?
[07:55] keyvan: oh
[07:55] Nuck: It interfaces with sockets and JS and provides a bridge
[07:55] Nuck: Yeah
[07:55] Nuck: Their setup is unevented on the client
[07:55] Nuck: It's hideous
[07:55] keyvan: unevented? so you mean it polls?
[07:56] Nuck: It's well over 150 functions on the global object, all named dAmn_*
[07:56] industrial: Anyone here use https://github.com/substack/node-seq ? I have a question about how to manage the stack. I want to do a parMap() but on every element in the top element in the stack instead of every element in the stack, and I don't know how.
[07:56] Nuck: keyvan: Nope, it just has it call a hard-coded function on each recieve
[07:56] industrial: so then I can do something for every one of those elements, return them modified to the stack and then use that later
[07:56] Nuck: And that then calls other functions and more functions, and more functions
[07:56] jro has joined the channel
[07:56] Nuck: All the bots have better setups than the client itself, it's pretty pathetic.
[07:57] keyvan: i think i could draw, if i practiced.
[07:57] AAA_awright: Nuck: What if I provided a chat server/client?
[07:57] Nuck: The way I found Node, was when I was looking for a CommonJS-compatible environment to try building a JS bot for there, I saw Node was based on V8, so I looked ad it and loved it.
[07:57] Nuck: AAA_awright: Huh?
[07:58] keyvan: AAA_awright: you'd get one .... billion .... dollars.
[07:58] AAA_awright: You're probably going to want your own chat system
[07:58] Nuck: The entire deviantART chat server has been rebuilt by a community project in C# lol
[07:58] AAA_awright: And I have plans to write one
[07:58] uchuff has joined the channel
[07:58] Nuck: AAA_awright: We're building ours on Socket.IO internally
[07:58] Nuck: We've already got a client too
[07:58] Nuck: from joltproject.com
[07:59] Nuck: http://joltproject.com/client/
[07:59] Nuck: That one
[07:59] MrNko has joined the channel
[07:59] Nuck: The server for that is Python with a MySQL backend, the transport is Flash, and the client is JS
[07:59] keyvan: Nuck: why did you "lol" after saying C#, do i have the right perception that C# is frowned upon by most people in our open source community?
[07:59] Nuck: It's fully evented, with an Event system inspired by Node's EventEmitters
[08:00] keyvan: ACTION has never used C#. never wants to, really.
[08:00] Nuck: keyvan: C# is an odd language, it's both interpreted and compiled
[08:00] Nuck: It compiles to a common language for all platforms, then it's interpreted for each platform
[08:00] Nuck: So it gets the problems that comes with each lol
[08:00] keyvan: ah jolt looks nice
[08:01] Nuck: Yeah
[08:01] AAA_awright: python?
[08:01] Nuck: There's some unfinished administration pages that are just as beautiful
[08:01] Nuck: AAA_awright: Aye.
[08:01] Nuck: I plan to rebuild the entire server and transport
[08:01] Nuck: Socket.IO with a Node + Mongo backend
[08:01] Nuck: And then mod out the client, probably refactor a bit
[08:02] Nuck: But the UI will remain very similar, I imagine.
[08:02] Nuck: Though we'll reskin it
[08:02] Nuck: I didn't do the server, I merely did some work on the client
[08:02] sfoster has joined the channel
[08:02] Nuck: Very little, but some.
[08:02] keyvan: i dont get it though
[08:02] keyvan: what's the point of reinventing the wheel on the web
[08:03] keyvan: irc works
[08:03] csanz has left the channel
[08:03] Nuck: keyvan: Not for most people
[08:03] Nuck: For those of us who know tech, sure
[08:03] Nuck: For a regular person, no
[08:03] MrNko has joined the channel
[08:03] keyvan: you could just as easily improve something like qwebirc
[08:03] keyvan: to have this interface.
[08:03] Nuck: Plus, it gives us the ability to tie into accounts on our site, provide thumbnails in chat, etc.
[08:03] Nuck: It just provides us with a lot of things IRC couldn't
[08:03] keyvan: ah sure
[08:04] `3rdEden has joined the channel
[08:04] AAA_awright: That's a downside
[08:04] keyvan: but IRC can still provide the server and client, and you can overlay your own junk in 
[08:04] AAA_awright: IRC can do authentication
[08:04] Nuck: keyvan: That's just a way to make a trashy setup
[08:04] AAA_awright: and thumbnails is just a plugin for a desktop client
[08:04] Nuck: Constantly throwing more shit onto a protocol is never good
[08:04] Druid_ has joined the channel
[08:04] Nuck: So we're building our own
[08:05] Nuck: It'll be well-documented
[08:05] keyvan: i'm all for reinventing, as long as something awesome comes out. and if you are contributing it at OSS then even better.
[08:05] keyvan: as*

[08:05] _kud has joined the channel
[08:05] AAA_awright: Also, that client is saying I don't have flash installed.
[08:05] keyvan: hah really?
[08:05] Nuck: Not like deviantART Chat, which was completely undocumented at first (they had a team called dAmnHacks which then reverse-engineered it)
[08:05] Nuck: AAA_awright: Yup, it does that :P
[08:05] Nuck: Main reason I'm plopping in socket.io is that exact error
[08:06] keyvan: i take back the positive things i said, i dont want flash in my interwebs!
[08:06] szomo: quick question about installing node on mediatemple dv server
[08:06] AAA_awright: Nuck: How about we just create IRC 2.0
[08:06] Daegalus: sounds like it can work
[08:06] szomo: if someone could ping me that would be awesome
[08:06] Daegalus: oops mt
[08:06] AAA_awright: With SSL authentication, and a better protocol
[08:06] AAA_awright: Server-side echoes and timestamps
[08:06] Nuck: AAA_awright: Well, if you create a protocol that can be easily adapted to Socket.IO, then sure.
[08:07] cosmincx has joined the channel
[08:07] Nuck: I'll probably build my own server, but there's a good chance I'll implement an open-source protocol
[08:07] Nuck: As long as it provides for great plugin support
[08:07] stonebranch has joined the channel
[08:07] Nuck: Like, a handshake process where client and server tell eachother what plugins they've got, etc.
[08:08] Nuck: And then plugins add commands to the protocol
[08:08] Nuck: AAA_awright: I would suggest a variant of Jolt's protocol, it's really quite elegant.
[08:08] Daegalus: why not just use XMPP?
[08:08] Nuck: Lemme see if I can recall the URL of our old wiki >_>
[08:08] Nuck: http://joltproject.com/wiki/doku.php
[08:08] Nuck: There
[08:09] Nuck: Beautiful, elegant protocol.
[08:09] AAA_awright: I'm just using Object key-values internally
[08:09] keyvan: are you going to make a native version of jolt? or are you of the mind that things like chat should move to the browser?
[08:10] Marak: so like, mouseover is no go for ios right?
[08:10] Nuck: keyvan: Well, we're not Jolt, that project was abandoned.  We're just a project codenamed "Fakooda", and we plan to have chat in our iPhone app
[08:10] Marak: like mobile saf
[08:10] Orion-: anyone got a repl script that really works (context wize)
[08:10] Orion-: ?
[08:10] AAA_awright: {event:"JOIN",time:1314950984.991,}
[08:10] Daegalus: Whatever you guys create, you should make it able to communicate with XMPP, or legacy IMs like AIM or MSN. Or Skype
[08:10] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[08:10] Marak: Orion-: custom repl?
[08:10] keyvan: why did it get abandoned? and does it have anything to do with this "writing job" ad link being here: http://cl.ly/43302S2i0f2e2M2k2N12
[08:10] Nuck: AAA_awright: How about you do an object with event, timestamp, room, payload
[08:11] Orion-: Marak: to be able to : $ node repl.js <my script to interact with>
[08:11] Marak: Orion-: boom? http://docs.nodejitsu.com/articles/REPL/how-to-create-a-custom-repl
[08:11] Nuck: keyvan: Heh, no, that's the spam on there
[08:11] AAA_awright: Nuck: Yeah
[08:11] AAA_awright: And I just pass those pbjects with SocketIO
[08:11] Nuck: keyvan: It got abandoned because they couldn't sell it and they didn't have enough time, so they ended up just giving up and moving on
[08:11] dexter_e: Anyone know why jQuery.html() runnin in JSDOM adds all these &lt;b&gt; characters instead of <>  ? 
[08:12] Marak: Orion-: also https://github.com/hookio/repl/blob/master/lib/repl.js
[08:12] Nuck: AAA_awright: Well, with socket.io, you could just do event as the event you're sending, then the rest of the object is your payload
[08:13] matyr has joined the channel
[08:13] Nuck: But yeah, take a look at the Jolt protocol, it's quite powerful, and insanely extensible.
[08:13] Orion-: Marak: oh but this one is using hook.io

[08:14] Nuck: Done.
[08:14] Nuck: Nice and simple
[08:14] Marak: Orion-: did you read the first link i sent you? regardless, just read the code, and ignore the hook.io part
[08:14] Nuck: Not like the IRC packets with their duct tape
[08:14] Marak: Orion-: the first link i sent you is a guide on how to build a custom repl
[08:14] Orion-: Marak: yes I'm on it
[08:14] Nuck: send\ducttape
[08:14] Marak: both should be able to help you
[08:15] Marak: Orion-: you can do what you want with what i sent + small hack
[08:15] Glenjamin: in 0.5.x you can subclass the REPLServer and supply a specific context
[08:15] Daegalus: Hmmm, maybe you guys should just make the JSON equivelent of XMPP. call it JSMPP
[08:15] Orion-: Marak: the problem I got is context related, when I use a repl script someone sent me it works but with few different outputs 
[08:15] Marak: Orion-: take in the argv arguments and then require(argv._[1]) or whatever and set that to repl.context
[08:16] Nuck: Daegalus: XMPP sucks
[08:16] Marak: ohh i dunno, there is an open issue on core about shared repl contextes
[08:16] Nuck: IT's no IRC
[08:16] Daegalus: Nuck: better than everything else
[08:16] Marak: not sure if thats what you mean
[08:17] matyr_ has joined the channel
[08:17] Nuck: XMPP is better-suited for IM than chatrooms
[08:17] Nuck: Though I assume it can probably do just about anything :P
[08:17] Daegalus: xmpp has MUC, multi-user chatroom
[08:17] Orion-: Marak: I'm testing mongodb connection. in a JS script I have something like 'var collection;' then later I connect to the db and create a collection and set the global collection but in the repl the global collection is not set whereas if I run it with no repl it is set
[08:17] Daegalus: fucntions identically to an IRC but supports all XMPP featuers
[08:18] Nuck: Daegalus: Yes, but IRC was built around the concept of rooms
[08:18] Nuck: Whereas XMPP was not, an MUC is more an addon
[08:19] Marak: whats a global collection Orion- ?
[08:19] Glenjamin: Orion-: Marak , this might be relevant https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/851
[08:20] Daegalus: i agree, but it still does the job. An example is the prosody web chat. connects to a MUC on their server. works just like a n IRC channel
[08:20] Orion-: Marak: sorry... the "var collection;" is a global scope declaration
[08:20] Marak: Orion-: that pull is what i was talking about
[08:21] Marak: i dont fully understand , but it all kinda makes sense now
[08:21] Marak: you can try to cherry-pick that if you want to live on the edge

[08:23] bergelmir has joined the channel
[08:24] bergelmir has joined the channel
[08:24] Glenjamin: the context runs in a vm thingy, so you won't have access to globals (i think)
[08:24] Glenjamin: anything you want in the repl context, you have to pass to it
[08:25] Glenjamin: globals are bad anyway :p

[08:26] Nuck: Not in a large project, then they come in handy
[08:26] Marak: i do a lot of custom repl stuff
[08:26] Marak: i never have issues with it
[08:26] Glenjamin: Nuck: they're worse in a large problem
[08:26] Glenjamin: *project
[08:26] Nuck: When you've gotta split into like 50 files, but they all need some variables, then it's useful
[08:26] Glenjamin: eugh
[08:27] Nuck: They're only bad when you abuse them
[08:27] kurokikaze has joined the channel
[08:27] Nuck: globals are good for things that need to be global
[08:27] Glenjamin: just pass the variables around
[08:27] kurokikaze: hello all
[08:27] Nuck: Glenjamin: Not that easy
[08:27] Glenjamin: explict dependency injection all the way
[08:27] Nuck: I did that before
[08:27] Nuck: It's a hell
[08:27] Glenjamin: having globals which share state across logically different bits of code is far worse
[08:27] Nuck: In a project like this, setting app and db and config as globals cut down my code heavily
[08:27] Glenjamin: and makes unit testing horrible
[08:28] Glenjamin: var config = require('./config).getConfig();
[08:28] Nuck: heh
[08:28] Glenjamin: etc
[08:28] Nuck: well, I do that
[08:28] Nuck: I do it once
[08:28] Nuck: in one file
[08:28] Nuck: And I'm done
[08:28] Nuck: It's actually more efficient too
[08:28] Nuck: Since it just has one instance of that
[08:28] Nuck: I assume anything global is something that has shared state or is read-only
[08:29] Glenjamin: you can have getConfig always return the same instance if you're really worried about the memory footprint of your config object
[08:29] Nuck: Glenjamin: That's a whole lotta work, for little benefit over global, and it's still not nearly as efficient
[08:30] Glenjamin: I generally have each executable load the config module, and then it passes the config, or some subset of to its various workers/initialisers
[08:30] Nuck: Honestly, people need to realize that these things are really only bad for when they're abused
[08:30] Nuck: As long as you only use global for things that are truly global, then it's fine
[08:30] Glenjamin: except your usage falls under my definition of abuse
[08:30] comster has left the channel
[08:30] Glenjamin: since when you come to unit test, you have to modify a global object to change things
[08:31] Glenjamin: rather than just passing it some config for that case

[08:32] Nuck: No offense, but the tests working is lower priority than having maintainable code :)
[08:32] Glenjamin: we'll have to agree to disagree then, unless someone casts a deciding vote
[08:32] Glenjamin: easy to test === maintainable
[08:32] Nuck: Not at all
[08:33] SubStack: if your code is easy to test it's easy to make it prettier
[08:33] Nuck: maintainable means you have code that lacks tons of boilerplate
[08:33] SubStack: and more maintainable
[08:33] Nuck: And globals removed asstons of boilerplate
[08:33] SubStack: -_-
[08:33] SubStack: globals should require a lot of justification
[08:33] Nuck: It meant that I no longer had variabls travelling through many functions to get to their eventual usage
[08:33] Nuck: And then it travelled back
[08:33] Nuck: It was a confusing mess to split into files
[08:34] Nuck: SubStack: I have three globals, and that's it.
[08:34] Orion-: Ok guys here is the gist: https://gist.github.com/1188180
[08:34] Nuck: config, app, and db
[08:34] SubStack: Nuck: sounds like your project could have been split up into a few separable modules
[08:34] Nuck: SubStack: It's not a module thing, it's one big API.
[08:34] SubStack: it's always a module thing
[08:34] Orion-: Marak: so the collection should be set. When using my repl script it is not
[08:34] SubStack: modules are the fundamental units of reuse
[08:34] Nuck: SubStack: Maybe for you, but in this case, it really isn't.
[08:35] Glenjamin: SubStack: are you the guy behind burrito? I'm going to try and integrate it with a unit testing framework i'm working on, but I'm wondering what the best way to assemble the output is
[08:35] nail_: tests are not nice, if a test fails, it's a bug, if there's no test for it, you can still say it's a feature
[08:35] markwubben has joined the channel
[08:35] Marak: wtf is a global
[08:35] Marak: you mean like, window?
[08:35] SebastianFlyte has joined the channel
[08:35] Marak: dont bind to window
[08:35] Nuck: Marak: or global in node :P
[08:35] Glenjamin: Orion-: that's not global, it's module-local
[08:35] Marak: node doesnt have globals
[08:35] Nuck: Yes it does
[08:35] Marak: i dare you to disagree with me
[08:35] Nuck: You set shit on global
[08:35] SubStack: Glenjamin: yep
[08:35] Nuck: And it shows up in things you require() too
[08:35] Marak: NEVER
[08:35] Marak: LIES
[08:35] SubStack: Glenjamin: you can just use bunker, which uses burrito to generate code coverage output
[08:36] Nuck: That's the big benefit for me
[08:36] Marak: fuck globals
[08:36] Marak: man up and require('toplevel') in every module
[08:36] SubStack: ACTION agrees with Marak 
[08:36] Nuck: Because it means I don't need to wrap all my modules in functions which then accept the express app and database object
[08:36] Marak: if you want that
[08:36] Orion-: And also the repl script I'm using (someone gave it to me here) https://gist.github.com/1188186
[08:36] Nuck: require('toplevel') isn't feasible for this
[08:36] SubStack: globals are pretty shit and only rarely necessary
[08:36] Glenjamin: SubStack: that's the one i mean't, but unsure how to take all the node objects and combine them with the original source input
[08:36] Nuck: It'd be a separate express instance for every module
[08:36] Nuck: And a separate db connection
[08:37] Orion-: Glenjamin: well it's global to the scope of the script
[08:37] Marak: SubStack: i think that rap video might set the record for awkward programming rap 
[08:37] SubStack: Glenjamin: if you want the original source segments you can src.slice(node.start.pos, node.end.pos + 1)
[08:37] Marak: SubStack: :-D
[08:37] Nuck: SubStack: I'm pretty sure tj said he has used them for express stuff >_>
[08:37] kurokikaze: what about windows node version now? It doesn't work for me
[08:37] SubStack: Marak: that was the effect I was aiming for, so excellent
[08:37] Glenjamin: SubStack: ig uess so, but after I apply any formatting i'll have to keep moving it along >.<
[08:37] Nuck: Database and Express are the two most obvious global things in a given program
[08:38] kurokikaze: "The procedure entry point CreateSymbolicLinkA could not be located in the dynamic link library KERNEL32.dll"
[08:38] Nuck: Trust me, shit's WAY simpler this way
[08:38] Nuck: I am tempted to switch to a config-passing system for the db module though
[08:38] MUILTFN has joined the channel
[08:38] Nuck: Allows easier separation
[08:38] SubStack: Glenjamin: also you can node.source() although that might not exactly match the original
[08:39] Orion-: Marak: Glenjamin : so when I do "$ node repl.js mongo-test.js " the collection is undefined, But when I do a "$ node mongo-test.js" it is set 
[08:39] Glenjamin: any idea what the performance overhead is like?
[08:39] Yoric has joined the channel
[08:39] Marak: SubStack: if i get into the kicking it real time thing, im gonna do an insane hook.io demo with the audience
[08:39] zomgbie has joined the channel
[08:39] Glenjamin: Orion-: that's because it's not global, it belongs to the mongo-test.js module
[08:42] Orion-: Glenjamin: so How do I access it in the repl ? do I have to use exports and stuff ?
[08:42] Glenjamin: either set up a custom repl and then set repl.context.connection = connection
[08:42] Nuck: SubStack: If you'd seen my codebase before and after, you'd probably agree that switching to global db and app was a smart move
[08:43] SubStack: Nuck: those are not the only two options
[08:43] Glenjamin: ^^ this
[08:43] SubStack: (false dilemma)
[08:43] Glenjamin: there are perfectly tidy ways to pass config, app and db around your modules
[08:43] Orion-: Glenjamin: Isn't it supposed to already do it in the repl.js I gist you ?
[08:43] Nuck: SubStack: Either pass shit around or use a global, right?
[08:44] abraxas: Can someone please confirm if it's normal that my NodeJS only has fs.chmod and fs.chmodSync, and none of the others? (lchmod*, fchmod*)
[08:44] SubStack: there are lots of ways to pass stuff around
[08:44] Nuck: Yes, most involve using functions, correct?
[08:44] Yoric has joined the channel
[08:44] Nuck: That's boilerplate
[08:44] Glenjamin: Orion-: which repl gist? I only see the mongo gist
[08:44] SubStack: what's fun about functional programming is that you can entirely invert the flow of the program
[08:44] FireFly has joined the channel
[08:44] Nuck: Useless code that could be avoided by using a global
[08:44] FireFly has joined the channel
[08:44] Orion-: Glenjamin: Orion-: And also the repl script I'm using (someone gave it to me here) https://gist.github.com/1188186
[08:45] Nuck: And you've yet to tell me one reason a global app and db setup is negative
[08:45] Nuck: It's the best tool for this situation, honestly.
[08:45] SubStack: Nuck: globals are tucked away in some obscure corner
[08:45] SubStack: you can't just look at single files anymore
[08:46] Nuck: SubStack: I have three globals, I expect all my devs to be able to remember them
[08:46] SubStack: you need to consider the entire application state
[08:46] Nuck: Not really
[08:46] Nuck: It's fucking Express
[08:46] Nuck: I'm just using global so I can require('./user-apis.js'); easier
[08:47] Nuck: And it automatically gets the app object
[08:47] SubStack: I hope ryah gets rid of 'global' and breaks all the shitty code that depends on it
[08:47] Nuck: It's the same as if that code were inlined in these cases
[08:47] Nuck: ACTION rolls his eyes
[08:47] Nuck: globals exist because having some things global is sometimes useful
[08:47] Glenjamin: Orion-: i see, try this https://gist.github.com/1188205
[08:47] Nuck: Don't go all "the good bits" on me
[08:48] SubStack: globals are a tidy abstraction waiting to happen
[08:48] Nuck: Because that was always a load of crock, and I always thought it was a load of crock.  It wasn't until a few years later that it was realized how much a load of crock it was.
[08:48] tshpaper has joined the channel
[08:48] Nuck: But I saw it, went "lolno"
[08:48] Orion-: Glenjamin: trying it ...
[08:48] SubStack: Nuck: you're strawmanning the whole of crockford's zany opinions with the issue of globals
[08:49] Nuck: and kept doing what I'd been doing, with minor changes
[08:49] adrianmg has joined the channel
[08:49] Nuck: SubStack: globals are a useful feature that are good for some cases
[08:49] SubStack: that's 2 fallacies in 10 minutes!
[08:49] Nuck: Not many cases
[08:49] Nuck: But some.
[08:49] SubStack: for lack of a better alternative maybe
[08:49] Glenjamin: globals destroy module separation just so you can skip this.db = db
[08:50] SubStack: but that should be treated as a failure of immagination I think
[08:50] Nuck: Using variable-passing for this stuff would be to use a spoon to slice bread.
[08:50] Nuck: It's the wrong tool for the job.
[08:50] Nuck: I want app and db to be EVERYWHERE
[08:50] Glenjamin: Nuck: what if you decide you now need 2 databases
[08:50] SubStack: Nuck: you can always invert the program flow
[08:50] Nuck: That is the desired effect
[08:50] aaronmcadam has joined the channel
[08:50] Nuck: Glenjamin: Then I'll make a local database variable
[08:50] Glenjamin: or you want to shard different parts of your app into separate servers
[08:51] SubStack: why pass the parameters to your custom functionality when the custom functionality can pass itself to you?
[08:51] Nuck: I plan to do that, not hard.
[08:51] Glenjamin: but half your app uses one databases, and the other half uses another
[08:51] Nuck: I set the variables in each shard
[08:51] Glenjamin: so you have db1 and db2 globals now?
[08:51] Nuck: It's actually easier to do that with globals in fact
[08:51] Orion-: Glenjamin: It's working in the repl. But not in without the repl (ReferenceError: collection is not defined)
[08:51] Nuck: Glenjamin: Passing the variables around would be painful if they were named the same, so globals is better, yes

[08:52] Glenjamin: Orion-: what line is the error coming from?
[08:53] Nuck: And the idea of custom functionality passing itself to you is painful
[08:53] Nuck: It adds boilerplate
[08:53] mykul|Home has joined the channel
[08:53] Nuck: Because I need to deal with both sides of this
[08:53] Nuck: Both the passing and recieving
[08:53] Orion-: Glenjamin: good point... I corrected it . Works on both
[08:53] Nuck: Which means I can't have either side too complex
[08:53] Nuck: Honestly, globals are the best solution.
[08:53] mykul|Home has joined the channel
[08:54] SubStack: Nuck: it seems premature to conclude that
[08:54] SubStack: perhaps globals are the best solution that you can think of
[08:54] SubStack: at the moment
[08:54] SubStack: but that is more a fact about you than a fact about the nature of the solution space
[08:54] Nuck: SubStack: I did that passing system before
[08:54] mykul|Home has joined the channel
[08:54] Orion-: Anyways you guys talk about global vars, how do you create a global var in node.js ?
[08:54] Nuck: It adds far too much boilerplate
[08:54] Nuck: It clutters code in an asynchronous setup
[08:54] ftrain has joined the channel
[08:55] Glenjamin: we had some globals and module-global stuff earlier in the codebase, I got rid of it all and it's so much better now
[08:55] mykul|Home has joined the channel
[08:55] Nuck: globals cut out all my boilerplate, now I have basically no overhead over just having one big file
[08:55] Glenjamin: Orion-: global.variable = value; will be shared across all modules in the process
[08:55] Orion-: Oh
[08:55] Orion-: I didn't know that
[08:55] Nuck: But I am able to reap the benefits of separating into files
[08:56] Nuck: It's an ideal setup, I get the best of both setups.
[08:56] Glenjamin: except the actual separation of modules
[08:56] Nuck: Yeah yeah, "modules"
[08:56] Nuck: This isn't a modular setup
[08:56] Nuck: Each thing relies on features from other things
[08:56] Glenjamin: then that is the crux of our differences :)
[08:56] SubStack: side effects!
[08:57] Orion-: Glenjamin: what is the problem with module-global vars ? It's used everywhere in every single node.js example no ?
[08:57] Nuck: Like, my tag module is required for my art module, and both rely on the database system being set up
[08:57] Nuck: But I need a lot of shared INSTANCES
[08:57] Nuck: not just shared CODE

[08:57] garrensmith: with mongoose with the middleware, are they always called before the method or can you do after as well. As in before save do something and after save do something
[08:57] Nuck: So it's either variable-passing for miles and miles, or globals.
[08:58] kuebk: have a question
[08:58] SubStack: sounds like a job for a tidy plugin system
[08:58] Nuck: I use mongo-native, though I just switched to mongoskin since it made the move to globals easier
[08:58] Nuck: SubStack: Not in this setup, not at all.
[08:58] kuebk: i want to pull a request which needs other not currently merged pull request

[09:01] Nuck: This whole issue of "shared state" is actually WHAT I WANT
[09:01] SubStack: but you can share it. cleanly
[09:01] Nuck: I *want* state to be shared among pieces, it's one server, it should be that way.  And that's what globals are designed for
[09:02] saimon_: Hi all. Can anyone tell me what's the equivalent of the ruby Logger api in node? Does this exist? Is there a standard api for logging to files?
[09:02] Nuck: To share a variable among everything in the process
[09:02] Nuck: And I need these things to be everywhere
[09:02] SubStack: it's just hard to reuse pieces
[09:02] Nuck: So I make them everywhere
[09:02] SubStack: since the pieces are coupled to the structure of the server
[09:02] Nuck: SubStack: I don't have the same way of reuse that you have
[09:02] kurtzhong has joined the channel
[09:02] SubStack: and if you change how the server works you break everything
[09:03] Nuck: It's always coupled like that, there's no avoiding it :V
[09:03] SubStack: your design has high cohesion
[09:03] saimon_: winston seems popular
[09:03] Nuck: SubStack: Yes, I need everything to be highly cohesive.
[09:03] Nuck: It's one cohesive server

[09:06] Nuck: No smaller project has any need for globals, nor should it
[09:06] Orion-: Glenjamin: but when I told you my var was global you replied it was module-global right ? so var http = require('http') is module-global no ?
[09:06] Glenjamin: simenbrekken: or for debugging in general https://github.com/dannycoates/node-inspector
[09:06] Glenjamin: i said module-local :p
[09:06] Glenjamin: or, i should have
[09:06] Orion-: Oh
[09:07] Orion-: I must have misread
[09:07] Nuck: but in a large project like this?  globals will greatly reduce the boilerplate everywhere
[09:07] Glenjamin: if you're ok with the coupling, then sure
[09:07] Nuck: Hence why I say, they're ideal for my circumstances.
[09:07] Glenjamin: but i'm not
[09:07] Nuck: coupling is fine in a single server
[09:07] Glenjamin: but I can't see either of us changing our minds
[09:07] Nuck: This is just a small chunk of our project
[09:07] Nuck: No matter what, it'd be tightly coupled
[09:08] Nuck: It's just the nature of a setup that uses a single HTTP server and a single DB connection
[09:08] Orion-: I prefer not to use global vars in any programming language personaly ;)
[09:08] Nuck: Orion-: I generally hate them too
[09:08] Nuck: But in this case, they're really necessary for my sanity going forward.
[09:09] Nuck: Otherwise, there's no way to keep track of what code got what and where
[09:09] saimon_: JaKWaC: Yes it appears to be just what I was looking for, thx
[09:09] Nuck: Now, I can rely on the assumption that I will have app and db, no matter where I go.
[09:09] Orion-: I don't get why it would be useful in any node.js project but it's maybe due to my lack of knowledge in this field since I'm pretty new to javascript

[09:12] justinTNT: best caching static server module?
[09:12] Nuck: justinTNT: Nginx
[09:13] justinTNT: but, is there a good node module?
[09:13] Nuck: not sure TBH
[09:13] Nuck: I'm just usig Nginx for static

[09:14] Nuck: I don't see how using globals reduces decoupling when nothing in the code changed, they still rely on the same assumptions in each file, it's just that I no longer wrap each file in a function to call when I require it
[09:14] Orion-: Or is it "every path lead to node"  ? I can't remember :)
[09:14] Nuck: It's literally the EXACT same code.
[09:15] Nuck: I just got to remove the boilerplate
[09:15] Nuck: I wish I could require() and pass variables to the outer scope of that file
[09:15] Nuck: That would be fucking useful
[09:16] Nuck: No boilerplate, but not global
[09:16] Nuck: I would use it
[09:16] Nuck: It'd be a pleasant compromise.

[09:18] Bennito: 1019
[09:18] justinTNT: nuck, just pass a config object in from the outside, then populate attributes it on the inside. problem solved. without opening the risk of a polluted global namespace
[09:19] Nuck|mobile: justinTNT: Pass a configuration file? Populate attributes? We're talking about two different things
[09:19] skm has joined the channel
[09:19] Nuck|mobile: But yes, I do get the configuration from the command line, actually
[09:20] Nuck|mobile: I use an environment var technically, process.env.ENVIR
[09:20] justinTNT: not a config file, a config object: instead of setting global variables deep inside, call those inner functions with a parameter that can be populated with the attributes you wanted global.
[09:20] Glenjamin: that's not the problem
[09:20] Glenjamin: the problem is passing config, app, db to all required modules
[09:20] Nuck|mobile: justinTNT: Not that easy. I don't just set functions.
[09:21] Nuck|mobile: I abuse require() as a fast, easy way to split large projects into files
[09:21] dexter_e: juggling chunks of HTML with jQuery/JSDOM on server but having &lt; instead of <> in results , anyone know why?
[09:21] markwubben has joined the channel
[09:22] Nuck|mobile: I admit I abuse it, but only because there's not really a better way, not like include() from php
[09:22] Nuck|mobile: Or #include
[09:22] dexter_e: Why does $.append() $.html()  running in JSDOM escape < > characters ?
[09:23] ph^ has joined the channel
[09:24] Nuck: In fact, I might look into building an include function eventually
[09:24] Nuck: I don't rely on app and such being global, I just expect it to be set for me already
[09:24] Glenjamin: it's roughly file read, vm.runInContext(this)
[09:24] Nuck: If I use the vm module, I could do that
[09:24] Nuck: Yeah, Glenjamin, exactly

[09:25] Nuck: In fact, it's PERFECT for things like that
[09:25] Nuck: But
[09:25] Nuck: When it comes to splitting up a large project, require just doesn't cut it.
[09:25] Glenjamin: I've got a python background, i'm used to structuring things in this way
[09:25] stagas has joined the channel
[09:26] Nuck: Glenjamin: You ever try splitting up a 2500+ line Express server into 25 files?
[09:26] Nuck: That's a general idea of what I'm faced with
[09:26] Marak: 2500 line express server
[09:27] Marak: ......2500 line express server
[09:27] Nuck: Marak: This is right now, about 2500 lines
[09:27] Marak: there isnt a rage face to express my current emotion
[09:27] Nuck: lolwat
[09:27] Marak: im very confused, do you mean 2500 lines total in express, or do you mean one big file?
[09:27] Nuck: I didn't let it hit 2500 lines in one file
[09:27] Glenjamin: i haven't used express yet, our stuff is all queue consumers
[09:27] Marak: ok
[09:28] Nuck: I realized I had to split it up early on, and refactored then
[09:28] Marak: 2500 lines is still wrong
[09:28] Nuck: That was what I call "Refactor 0"
[09:28] Glenjamin: let me do an unscientific line count
[09:28] booo has joined the channel
[09:28] Nuck: Marak: What do you mean?
[09:28] Marak: thats too many lines
[09:28] Nuck: It's a VERY large project
[09:28] Nuck: This thing is to run a whole API
[09:28] Nuck: From login, to account creation, to everything else
[09:28] industrial: Is this correct usage of node-seq? https://gist.github.com/b65ae1d022819d3a94d7
[09:28] Marak: hook.io is a very large project
[09:28] Marak: its like 400 lines
[09:29] Marak: :p
[09:29] Nuck: I can remove the require() lines and add them and whatnot
[09:29] Nuck: Marak: I also have artwork management and such too :P
[09:29] Nuck: It's well over 400
[09:29] aaronmcadam: 1000 require lines P
[09:29] ishupa has joined the channel
[09:29] Nuck: I hit 1000 a while back, I'm just guesstimating that it's roughly grown to 2500
[09:29] Nuck: Probably overestimating
[09:29] Marak: you should have multiple applications, 2500 lines is too much core logic , should have been put into separate projects, or separate projects 
[09:29] aaronmcadam: Nuck is it possible to separate it into their own modules?
[09:30] Nuck: Not really, they all rely on an express server and the database layer I've got
[09:30] Marak: if you are talking about all application code
[09:30] Nuck: So they're forced to be tightly coupled to those bits
[09:30] Marak: and not templates and crap
[09:30] Nuck: Which are global
[09:30] Nuck: Marak: I don't have templates
[09:30] Glenjamin: my main queue consumer process is about 4119 lines (grep . -c)
[09:30] Nuck: This is an API :P
[09:30] Glenjamin: split over a bunch of files

[09:35] Nuck: I've got 5 files for database stuff

[09:35] Nuck: 5 for APIs
[09:35] Glenjamin: find . | xargs wc -l
[09:36] Nuck: And another 10 for various other purposes

[09:44] Nuck: And it comes out about 1425
[09:45] Nuck: Before I switched to using globals, it was probably well over 1500
[09:46] Nuck: Just because it was boilerplated as fuck
[09:46] Nuck: But as I said before, I'm not even halfway done
[09:46] Nuck: I'm well over halfway to that 2500 mark

[12:42] emanuellauria: Funny, I just came to ask a POST request question. I am using exactly that code example from stackoverflow and it works when I make the request to my own server.
[12:42] emanuellauria: but when i try to use a remote server, it failes with: Error: Can't set headers after they are sent.
[12:43] emanuellauria: the problem is in setting the Content-Lenght
[12:43] emanuellauria: but I don't know how come it works with my own server but fails with others

[14:13] mrdoodles: quickie on veal vs. dynamic. if I'm loading some models un unknown name i can create this string and eval it, but wondering if i can do it without eval? this borks now - global.modelName = require("./../../models/"+modelName+")".modelName;
[14:13] emanuellauria: Sembiance: I tried it but I get an Invalid protocol error. This is my code: https://gist.github.com/1188688 its a simple POST with a json obj. Could you be so kind to give it a look? :)
[14:13] mrdoodles: so say model name is Post

[14:25] sfoster: I'm looking for way to serve static files w. express, but with something like apache's Alias? e.g. Alias /js /some/path/to/js; Alias /img /some/other/path/to/img
[14:25] aheckmann has joined the channel
[14:26] Sembiance: sfoster: I find it best to use nginx to serve static files. And have it proxy your node requests back to node
[14:27] Sembiance: sfoster: so run nginx on port 80, and your node on some 127.0.0.1 port like 4700 and then in your nginx.conf do this: https://gist.github.com/1173452
[14:27] Glenjamin: or use a unix socket
[14:27] sfoster: Sembiance: I'm trying to remove apache -or other servers - from the equation. This is a dev convenience, so I can put a dev server in the git repo with my project 
[14:27] Sembiance: sfoster: So there nginx servers all my static files direct up. then requests made to /node go to the actual express.js instance I have running
[14:27] Sembiance: sfoster: oh :)
[14:27] Glenjamin: sfoster: ah, i see
[14:27] Glenjamin: there should be some decent static middleware
[14:28] torsd has joined the channel
[14:29] Glenjamin: yup, connect's static seems good enough for dev

[15:45] Benjie: I'm trying to understand why express.session.MemoryStore sessions have .reload() and similar methods but RedisStore doesn't seem to. (express/connect/connect-redis)

[15:47] Benjie: From the RedisStore source it appears to just return a JSON object with no methods - am I reading it right?
[15:47] Benjie: https://github.com/visionmedia/connect-redis/blob/master/lib/connect-redis.js
[15:47] tjholowaychuk: yeah, they should only be working with json
[15:47] tjholowaychuk: not storing methods on the session etc
[15:47] tjholowaychuk: when it's retreived it becomes a Session instance
[15:48] tjholowaychuk: if ('object' == typeof data) {
[15:48] tjholowaychuk:     utils.merge(this, data);

[15:51] Benjie: tjholowaychuk: that sounds like what I want, my object isn't ever becoming a Session instance (I'm trying to combine Express with socket.io - have it working with MemoryStore but not with RedisStore)
[15:51] mykul|Home has joined the channel
[15:52] tjholowaychuk: Benjie gotcha. I want to refact to the retrieval part so that you can get the session as Session any time
[15:52] Benjie: Where can I find the utils.merge line above for context so I can mod my code to force implementation of it on the plain JSON object returned from RedisStore.get()
[15:52] tjholowaychuk: just need to abstract that out properly

[16:01] Benjie: I have the session data, but I'm not sure how to get/fake the req object.
[16:01] tjholowaychuk: https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/master/lib/middleware/session/store.js#L50
[16:01] tjholowaychuk: moving that where it is removed some duplicate code
[16:02] tjholowaychuk: so that was the first step to abstracting it out
[16:02] bluesmoon has joined the channel
[16:02] tjholowaychuk: but it should be done within part of the store retrieval part automatically so at any time if you know the sid you can get the full Session
[16:03] tjholowaychuk: this was just a tmp fix for the duplication
[16:03] tjholowaychuk: though some of it should be removed, resetLastAccess() etc since it's not the user hitting the session

[18:25] kuebk: Murvin i mean everybody experiences strange things using IE
[18:25] DrMcKay: Murvin: but seriously, what session?
[18:25] Murvin: ok.. i have two call.  e.g. app.get('/a') app.get('/b')     and use express.session as the middleware
[18:26] Murvin: when I run in FX, Chrome..etc    i call mydomain.com/a  and mydomain.com/b   and they have the same session. that's right.
[18:26] Murvin: however, when I do the same thing on IE.   the session ID change.  not the same session.
[18:26] DrMcKay: Murvin: cookie-related problem?
[18:26] Murvin: i wonder if the session cookie  is created 
[18:27] Murvin: so hard to debug in IE.. damn

[18:33] Murvin: any cookie
[18:33] Murvin: wtf
[18:33] Murvin: not just session cookie

[18:33] Murvin: how to add it

[18:34] kuebk: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.5.5/api/http.html#response.setHeader
[18:34] mrdoodles: if i write a logger which logs to files vs console. is there a "strategy" with express? so currently for the console i have this: app.use(express.logger({ format: ":method :url :status" }));
[18:34] mrdoodles: should i have express.logger(myLogger)
[18:34] Murvin: i mean.. like res.header('content-Type", "text/html");

[18:46] Orion-: jerrysv: thanks anyways ... it seems to be a greak lib
[18:46] Orion-: great
[18:46] jesusabdullah: Basically, you want require("crypto").createHash("sha1").update(yourString).digest("hex")
[18:47] jesusabdullah: It looks like we're having some encoding issues on docs.nodejitsu, sorry about that
[18:47] Orion-: jesusabdullah: that's exactly what I did

[18:48] brainproxy: kuebk: there's a small one-time fee if you want to use it commercially, iirc
[18:48] Orion-: jesusabdullah: I get a 'TypeError: Not a string or buffer" before the update call

[18:49] brainproxy: kuebk: http://www.rgraph.net/docs/licensing.html

[18:52] Orion-: But you're right
[18:52] Orion-: Hope there are not too much dependencies when compiling
[18:53] Orion-: what about npm ?

[20:11] simon1: tuhoojabotti: cool thanks.
[20:12] toabi: dictionary, mutable
[20:12] scott_gonzalez has joined the channel

[20:12] tuhoojabotti: Or that's what I call it. :/

[20:12] simon1: if i do: var a = {}, how do i add to that dictionary?

[20:13] simon1: geez. that was simple. thanks
[20:13] toabi: yeah it's also an object
[20:13] simon1: why am i having trouble finding this documentation?
[20:13] tuhoojabotti: simon1: I recommend you to read some basic js tutorials ;D

[20:17] Nuck: tuhoojabotti: lol
[20:17] Nuck: tuhoojabotti: Is nvm in JS or Python?
[20:17] tuhoojabotti: NO idea.
[20:17] tuhoojabotti: It just works.
[20:17] Nuck: lol
[20:17] tuhoojabotti: Problems?
[20:17] `3rdEden: nvm is bash
[20:17] tuhoojabotti: It's pure awesomeness.
[20:17] Nuck: Oh
[20:17] `3rdEden: just `n`
[20:17] Nuck: What does it do for you?
[20:18] `3rdEden: install node versions for you
[20:18] tuhoojabotti: manages node versions.
[20:18] Nuck: What's better than doing it myself?
[20:18] `3rdEden: yup
[20:18] tuhoojabotti: ease.
[20:18] `3rdEden: as you can install and manage multiple versions
[20:18] Nuck: make install is pretty easy
[20:18] tuhoojabotti: Yeah.
[20:18] Nuck: Oh
[20:18] `3rdEden: nvm use v0.4.1
[20:18] `3rdEden: and you will be using node v0.4.1
[20:18] tuhoojabotti: Yes.
[20:18] `3rdEden: pretty sweet for testing

[20:21] tuhoojabotti: "Now using node 0.4.11"
[20:21] tuhoojabotti: :)
[20:21] tuhoojabotti: That was easy.
[20:22] tuhoojabotti: Insekticid: I recommend you to get nvm.
[20:23] Insekticid: tuhoojabotti: I have nvm, but it doesn't solve my problem :-) I don't want to compile node, it took me 2x over and hour and freezed.
[20:23] Insekticid: *an hour
[20:23] tuhoojabotti: xD
[20:23] Insekticid: :-D too slow VPS
[20:24] tuhoojabotti: I recommend you to get a better one.

[23:13] isaacs: squeese: then mv package blah

[23:13] squeese: isaacs: ah sweet, thx - will do
[23:13] kuebk: http://pastebin.com/J07sTUqZ
[23:14] isaacs: squeese: then cd blah; npm install
[23:14] chjj_ has joined the channel
[23:14] isaacs: squeese: why do you need to do this?
[23:14] kuebk: if i removef socket.write
[23:14] kuebk: it works with socket.end
[23:14] isaacs: squeese: i'm curious, cuz if it's a common enough use case, it would be worth adding
[23:16] squeese: well, in my case its sort of a special case, I have a folder wich I have all my modules in, however - this project i'd like the modules to go with the project, easy to ship whole project
[23:16] isaacs: oh, ok
[23:16] isaacs: npm install blah; mv node_modules/blah lib/blah
[23:16] squeese: hmm, that made sense while typing it ><
[23:16] isaacs: or just mv node_modules deps
[23:16] isaacs: or something silly like that
[23:16] isaacs: then probably wanna find deps -name .gitignore | xargs rm
[23:17] isaacs: just to make sure they get checked into git properly
[23:17] squeese: yah, thx :)

[23:18] mcepl: one more (possibly) stupid question about express-resources ... what's the difference between new and create?
[23:19] fitnerd has joined the channel
[23:19] tjholowaychuk: mcepl #express
[23:19] mcepl: thanks
[23:20] mcepl: ACTION is confused by too many too small channels
[23:20] tjholowaychuk: mcepl just helps keep this channel a bit cleaner
[23:20] mcepl: well, yes ... 667 :(

[23:28] schow: hello world
[23:29] Serby: If you fs.createWriteStream then delete the file. Should the error event fire?
[23:29] AAA_awright: Serby: Unlink the file? No
[23:30] AAA_awright: The file can still exist even if there's no links to it
[23:30] AvianFlu: it might just create a new file
[23:30] AvianFlu: I'm not sure though
[23:30] Serby: okay. For log rotation is there anyway to detect the unlink.
[23:30] AAA_awright: That's correct: You can create a file, "delete" unlink it, then continue writing to it and reading from it as if it still existed... You just can't access it from any filename
[23:30] Serby: It doesn't create a new file
[23:31] bnoordhuis: the OS keeps the file around, it's just not visible anymore in the file system
[23:31] AvianFlu: that makes more sense
[23:31] Serby: Currently I'm stopping the process rotating the log and restarting.
[23:31] AvianFlu: doesn't sound like a state I want to be in :)

[23:33] Serby: I was hoping there was some way to avoid the process. But it is only once a day so I'll live with it. Thanks for the help.
[23:33] ronnieboy has joined the channel
[23:34] AvianFlu: Serby, you're looking to switch log files, or just to get rid of the past day's logs?
[23:35] Serby: Compressing the previous days and creating a new one

[23:49] elliottcable: Hm. I remember, ages ago, there was a utility function for faux-inheriting some members of one object into another.
[23:49] elliottcable: What was that?
[23:52] bnoordhuis: elliottcable: util.inherits()
[23:52] elliottcable: The documentation on that is massively unenlightening, bnoordhuis. What’s it *actually do*.
[23:53] elliottcable: I need to copy some values out of the current scope into a REPLServer’s `context` member (looks like replacing it wholesale won’t Work™)
[23:53] elliottcable: and doing it one at a time is fugly.
[23:53] bnoordhuis: elliottcable: it makes class Desc a subclass of class Base
[23:53] bnoordhuis: elliottcable: vm.runInThisContext()?
[23:54] elliottcable: bnoordhuis ⁓ seems like overkill for the task.
[23:54] elliottcable: not, for that matter, sure it would work.
[23:55] elliottcable: I’ll just write a function to do it. It’d be all of, what, three lines of code?
[23:55] elliottcable: for, in, has own property, done.
[23:55] bnoordhuis: elliottcable: yep
