[00:16] malkomalko: tjholowaychuk: kue.. how do you tie it in with your existing express app?
[00:16] tjholowaychuk: you'd want kue as a stand-alone process
[00:17] tjholowaychuk: probably with cluster like i have in the readme
[00:17] _beau_ has joined the channel
[00:17] malkomalko: and then you'd fire off an http request to it to insert a job or something from your other app?
[00:17] patcoll has joined the channel
[00:17] tjholowaychuk: just tcp to redis
[00:17] tjholowaychuk: using kue's api
[00:18] DTrejo: tjholowaychuk: at some point I might add an option to the express stylus middleware so that it watches .styl files for changes and recompiles, that way vogue will can reload the sheets in the browser without developer having to refresh the whole page
[00:18] tjholowaychuk: hmm
[00:18] malkomalko: should that be obvious to me reading the readme?
[00:19] tjholowaychuk: not sure i want that in stylus itself
[00:19] tjholowaychuk: malkomalko "Creating Jobs"
[00:20] DTrejo: tjholowaychuk: true, I suppose I can make my own middleware and not bother you :)
[00:20] tjholowaychuk: everyone has these complicated ways to reload browsers etc
[00:20] tjholowaychuk: just setTimeout and reload
[00:20] tjholowaychuk: haha :D
[00:20] tjholowaychuk: and avoid all the other cruft
[00:21] malkomalko: so you have kue to create jobs in your real app, and then a separate kue server that listens for jobs basically?
[00:21] tjholowaychuk: yup
[00:21] tjholowaychuk: there is a restful json api too documented there
[00:21] tjholowaychuk: mostly just for the UI
[00:22] malkomalko: if you want those processes on separate servers, can you specify the redis connection settings?
[00:23] tjholowaychuk: currently it uses several connections so i'll need to stub out a redis connection method that can be replaced
[00:23] tjholowaychuk: but right now it's just a bunch of redis.createClient() calls

[00:51] tauren: so someone hacking from a certain IP, or attempting to hack some php app with an sqlinjected payload will be blocked not only on the site the attack was discovered on, but also any other sites that use their service.

[01:24] seawise: is node.js good for this?
[01:25] seawise: or I should use nginx for that?
[01:25] seawise: is it good for serving files?
[01:26] JaKWaC: How are the files going to be stored?
[01:26] context: darrow: or run a real http server (read: nginx) on port 80 and have it forward to your node backend?
[01:26] materialdesigner has joined the channel
[01:26] seawise: how fast is it? Can it serve as a replacement for nginx in terms of speed and memory consumption?
[01:26] context: seawise: pls be more vague. you are being too detailed about your requirements
[01:27] seawise: I think files will be stored statically

[01:28] seawise: sure
[01:28] Borgoluzzuo has joined the channel
[01:28] seawise: I'm asking about serving files
[01:29] seawise: for download
[01:29] Borgoluzzuo: Is there a way to share a mysql connection amongst different files?
[01:29] context: personally for static files id use nginx over node. 
[01:29] context: borgoluzzuo: pass the connection around ?
[01:29] Borgoluzzuo: context: Yeah, if possible.
[01:29] context: have your code initiate the connection, then give that connection to other instances of objects that need it
[01:30] Borgoluzzuo: context: Just through straight up variable assignments?
[01:30] context: or keep a static connection in a 'singleton' variable and have a centralized access point for all db interaction
[01:30] Borgoluzzuo: Is there a good way to have a centralized access point included across multiple files?
[01:31] context: which, i suppose you still prolly need to pass a variable around
[01:31] Borgoluzzuo: blast -- alrighty.  Thanks -- just starting to get up and going with Node.
[01:31] context: it might be possible. depends on how node caches require()d files

[05:02] Nuck: Hardy little sucker, too.
[05:02] Nuck: I could throw a hell of a lot at it and it wouldn't fail.
[05:03] Nuck: And I like to think I did a pretty good job making it optimized, but I dunno.
[05:03] tbranyen: oh one thing you should note is that typeof null == 'object'
[05:03] Nuck: Ah true
[05:04] Nuck: tbranyen: That always gets me, every time.
[05:04] Nuck: But isn't a null in an array ignored in length?
[05:04] tbranyen: but you're doing for (var key in null)
[05:04] tbranyen: dunno what will happen
[05:04] Nuck: aye but else if (arguments.length == 2)
[05:05] tbranyen: null will show up there
[05:05] Nuck: It would?
[05:05] Nuck: Ah, well, so it had one point of failure
[05:05] Nuck: Still, I think it's a pretty hardy little beast.
[05:05] Nuck: And a useful one at that.
[05:05] tbranyen: just pointing it out
[05:05] tbranyen: i'm not shutting down the code
[05:05] tbranyen: heh

[05:06] Nuck: It'd probably have been easier if I'd added to the String prototype, but I'm not the kinda guy who goes around modding out native prototypes
[05:06] Nuck: Never have been, never will be.
[05:06] tbranyen: why?
[05:06] Nuck: Well, except when it's for functions like .bind(), for backwards-compatibility.
[05:07] Nuck: tbranyen: I like to leave no traces, so to speak
[05:07] Nuck: My code cleans up after itself very efficiently.
[05:07] AvianFlu has joined the channel
[05:07] Nuck: Well, not so much in memory usage as in variables.
[05:07] tbranyen: extending those types are a language feature, its part of the value of prototype chain
[05:07] jmoyers: bah to that
[05:08] jmoyers: not until enumerable: false, thank you very much
[05:08] Nuck: I'm the kind of person who encapsulates.
[05:08] tbranyen: jmoyers: in node? you should be using Object.keys()
[05:08] tbranyen: and not worrying about yesterdays for in issue
[05:08] jmoyers: for in is a feature
[05:08] jmoyers: and fuck hasOwnProperty
[05:08] tbranyen: and it works exactly as expected
[05:08] Nuck: jmoyers: ...
[05:08] Mrfloyd has joined the channel
[05:09] Nuck: jmoyers: I'm pretty sure hasOwnProperty is a pretty helpful function.
[05:09] tbranyen: its just unnecessary
[05:09] jmoyers: yes, but an if statement for every for in loop
[05:09] Nizam has joined the channel
[05:09] jmoyers: is stupid
[05:09] Nuck: tbranyen: I agree on that.
[05:09] xastey has joined the channel
[05:09] tbranyen: Object.keys({obj).forEach(function(key) { var val = obj[key]; });
[05:09] jmoyers: im fine with certain prototypes
[05:09] tbranyen: damn son thats hard
[05:09] jmoyers: but not Object
[05:10] xastey: I know this goes against the whole idea of node.. but is it possible to make a blocking http request ?
[05:10] tbranyen: jmoyers: Oh sorry, Object is definitely not in the picture

[05:10] felixge has joined the channel
[05:10] tbranyen: that one is untouchable so-to-speak
[05:10] jmoyers: anyway, this is addressed with enumerable: false and other such Object.create type features
[05:11] tbranyen: jmoyers: enumerable false works with Object.defineProperty as well
[05:11] jmoyers: yes indeed
[05:11] tbranyen: although i'm not sure how thats affected in a for in statement
[05:11] stride has joined the channel
[05:11] tbranyen: if you attach to the prototype
[05:11] jmoyers: it doesn't enumerate
[05:11] jmoyers: for in skips over it
[05:12] jmoyers: i mean, I'm not using a bunch of for in loops all over the place, don't get me wrong
[05:12] jmoyers: but other code potentially does
[05:12] jmoyers: and prototype changes leak across scope
[05:12] meso has joined the channel
[05:13] tbranyen: jmoyers: just tested, thats awes
[05:13] terite has joined the channel
[05:13] jmoyers: takes the taboo off modifying builtins, imo
[05:14] tbranyen: although i'm not sure when that would be a problem outside of modifying the Object prototype
[05:14] tbranyen: which i think anyone can agree is no go
[05:14] jmoyers: Array i suppose
[05:14] tbranyen: for in doesn't work on array anyways
[05:14] tbranyen: it wasn't designed for that
[05:15] jmoyers: thats not true
[05:16] tbranyen: http://sharefilewith.me/u/5f11f7.png
[05:16] tbranyen: doesn't look like its workie 4 me
[05:16] jmoyers: v8: var a = [1,2,3]; Array.prototype.iam = 'stinky'; for(var b in a){ console.log(b); };
[05:16] jmoyers: no v8bot?!
[05:16] jmoyers: whaaat
[05:16] tbranyen: v8 is not the only js implementation
[05:16] tbranyen: that was using presto
[05:17] jmoyers: no, im saying in here
[05:17] tbranyen: maybe it works in v8, but that doesn't speak to javascript as a whole
[05:17] rhdoenges: no, the bot in here
[05:17] rhdoenges: that evals code.
[05:17] tbranyen: well aware
[05:17] tbranyen: i wasn't talking about that
[05:18] jmoyers: and yes, it does enumerate in v8
[05:18] tbranyen: >> for(i in [1,2,3]) { console.log(i); }
[05:18] tbranyen: :-/
[05:18] jmoyers: if you modify Array.prototype
[05:18] isaqual has joined the channel
[05:18] tbranyen: jmoyers: it wasn't designed for arrays tho, doesn't matter if it works in v8
[05:18] tbranyen: that might just be the way arrays are represented
[05:18] jmoyers: who declared its not for arrays?
[05:18] jmoyers: im not clear on what you mean
[05:18] tbranyen: the ecma spec?
[05:19] meso has joined the channel
[05:19] Nuck: So do either of you know how a browser will take an image sent without a mime type?
[05:19] Nuck: Because IIS will most likely choke on files without extensions, so I want to know if the browser will pick up the slack

[05:22] avalanche123 has joined the channel
[05:22] SubStack: \o/
[05:22] jmoyers: could be
[05:22] tbranyen: thats what she said
[05:22] tbranyen: jmoyers: but yeah modifying the array prototype is a good call if someone were to be using that
[05:23] Nuck: The reason for in isn't for arrays is because it goes over the things on the array prototype too, right?
[05:23] tbranyen: Nuck: well objects have prototypes
[05:23] jmoyers: god damn i wish i could find a searchable version of the spec
[05:23] tbranyen: so thats a moot point
[05:23] jmoyers: that wasn't a piece of shit pdf
[05:23] tbranyen: jmoyers: srsly the pdf is retarded
[05:23] tbranyen: also ecmascript != javascript
[05:23] tbranyen: which is even more annoying
[05:23] tbranyen: heh
[05:23] tbranyen: not sure if they are identical in that regard of for in, but some things i suppose could be different

[05:33] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[05:34] Nuck: jmoyers: My static file server is IIS, because in discussing the static server with my host, he informed me that IIS performs better than lighttpd or NGINX if it doesn't have to parse anything.
[05:34] Nuck: That it can take a load best.
[05:34] jmoyers: fuuuuck iis
[05:34] edt: @Prometheus thanks for the links, but still no luck... will try again in the morning
[05:34] yhahn has left the channel

[05:34] brianseeders has joined the channel
[05:34] Prometheus: edt: alright, sorry I couldn't help you out
[05:34] jmoyers: and you can't have file extensions or control over the headers because...?
[05:35] Nuck: jmoyers: I said the same thing, but he's got more knowledge on the subject than I do.  As for extensions, I want to normalize all files so they don't have extensions.
[05:35] Nuck: Because otherwise I hafta pass around the value of that extension for any page to grab a user's icon.
[05:35] jmoyers: i'd love to see the benchmark
[05:35] jmoyers: and technology lockin with iss is crap
[05:36] jmoyers: also if you're so concerned about static file serving
[05:36] Nuck: jmoyers: I agree, but it's only a static server ;)
[05:36] jmoyers: you'll probably want to move to a cdn at some point

[05:40] Lorentz: mscdex: if anyone writes one up, hope they do one for xen as well
[05:40] Nuck: jmoyers: I'm gonna prolly switch to Linux+Nginx instead of Windows+IIS, the performance shouldn't be too much of a difference.
[05:40] Lorentz: That's be pretty handy, for people doing a lot of that
[05:41] jmoyers: i dont think shit like that matters until it _matters_
[05:41] jmoyers: if you know what i mean
[05:41] jmoyers: i wouldn't worry about optimizing static file serve, unless you've got massive massive traffic
[05:42] jmoyers: then, i kid you not, it will be a no brainer to go to a cookieless cdn
[05:42] Jakwac has joined the channel
[05:42] jmoyers: just my opinion, though
[05:42] bingomanatee has joined the channel
[05:42] Nuck: jmoyers: Well, the problem is, I'm hosting huge files.
[05:42] jmoyers: i see
[05:42] jmoyers: a topic on which i have absolutely no experience ;-)
[05:42] Nuck: I'm doing an art site
[05:42] jmoyers: ah
[05:42] jmoyers: art
[05:43] jmoyers: not multi gigabyte or something
[05:43] Nuck: No, but large images
[05:43] Nuck: And I need it to host them quickly and in parellel.
[05:44] Corren: so as I understand it, if I have index.ejs, that's passed to layout.ejs as a variable called body
[05:44] Nuck: I originally suggested Nginx, that being one of the evented servers
[05:44] Corren: i'm stumped tho: my markup in index.ejs isn't being parsed; it's escaped :S
[05:44] Lorentz: I do varnish and nginx, currently set to serve only static files like images in varnish
[05:44] Lorentz: No fancy cdn or anything though.
[05:44] Nuck: Lorentz: Varnish?
[05:45] jmoyers: http cache
[05:45] jmoyers: *fast
[05:45] Nuck: Ah
[05:45] Corren: i do nginx + node
[05:46] Nuck: Yeah, I think nginx should be a good choice
[05:47] Mrfloyd has joined the channel
[05:47] Nuck: Eww "Furthermore, Varnish is heavily threaded, with each client connection being handled by a separate worker thread."
[05:47] jmoyers: hehe
[05:48] jmoyers: thats a common theme
[05:48] jmoyers: and not necessarily the devil
[05:48] Nuck: Hopefully not for long :P
[05:48] Corren: currently I don't serve any content through node (only api calls) although I'm currently putting ejs back in for some server composition
[05:48] jmoyers: anyway, varnish is pretty heavily used out there
[05:48] jmoyers: in the ruby world and such
[05:48] Nuck: That's honestly an amazing way to die from DDoS
[05:48] Nuck: jmoyers: Well, no wonder it sucks :P
[05:49] jmoyers: naaah
[05:49] Corren: Nuck: you talking about my implementation?
[05:49] jmoyers: relative problems
[05:49] Nuck: Corren: No, Varnish
[05:49] Corren: h ok :)

[05:50] Nuck: But one thread per client is really a great way to make DDoS attacks easy.
[05:50] TheEmpath: yes it is
[05:50] jmoyers: iiii don't know man
[05:50] jmoyers: if you have a ddos going on
[05:50] jmoyers: you have bigger problems than one thread per connection

[06:16] Lorentz: Kinda expensive, but they seem reliable
[06:16] jmoyers: linode also
[06:16] jmoyers: for my personal servers
[06:16] tuhoojabotti: I get free hosting and 500GB backup space for free :P
[06:17] Prometheus: Lorentz: linode is expensive?
[06:17] shadow_s: quite expensive, i'm looking at it now, lol
[06:17] Prometheus: if they are too expensive, try IntoVPS
[06:17] Nuck: I know a guy who has an excess of server space and who needs a big client to expand his hosting business.
[06:17] jacob_: @Nuck That's definitely what I do for myself, but my company wants something they can feel reassured about. So is there any equivalents of no.de, heroku or duostack but with actual servers and support in Europe?
[06:17] Prometheus: (but no, Linode is quite cheap, tbh)
[06:17] tuhoojabotti: Just have to be a member of this organization, it's 35€/yr
[06:17] Nuck: So I'm basically off the hook until I grow :P
[06:17] xerox: you pay mostly for the tools and the reliability
[06:17] Lorentz: Prometheus: Compared to el cheapo vps lying around, yes, expensive
[06:17] Prometheus: try running EC2 for a while, see how that compares =P
[06:17] xerox: stuff like if your node goes down, they up your stuff on another in a matter of uuh minutes?

[06:21] tuhoojabotti: ram
[06:21] xerox: how much disk space and bandwidth allocated?
[06:21] tuhoojabotti: 555GB storage and so on :P

[06:21] Prometheus: at least
[06:21] shadow_s: how well do you guys think shared node hosting would work? you'd get shell access but someone else would take care of the details. i'd imagine that would be a good way to get cheap development nodejs installations possible

[06:30] Prometheus: run it in headless mode
[06:30] shadow_s: Prometheus: well, i'm not sure actually, maybe i can do it better? i'd probably have to look into nodejitsu a bit more to really understand it
[06:30] Prometheus: you can enable the GUI mode if you want, too, I think
[06:30] Prometheus: shadow_s: in all honesty, you probably can't
[06:30] Prometheus: the resources those service providers have put in to creating the environments
[06:30] Prometheus: replicating that by yourself would take a while ;)
[06:30] Prometheus: at least, if you want to offer same quality service
[06:31] Prometheus: it's not like you can put together something like heroku over night :)
[06:31] shadow_s: well, since it's open source, it's just a fork away isn't it?
[06:31] Lorentz: No, I rather my virtualized instances to be headless
[06:31] Lorentz: Unless windoze, etc, but eh, I don't deploy to windows machines.
[06:31] Prometheus: shadow_s: well, I haven't actually looked in to what nodejitsu has on github, so I couldn't say definitely
[06:31] Prometheus: shadow_s: but there's more to that than just the scripts =P
[06:32] Prometheus: Lorentz: yeah, it's sufficient for running ubuntu or whatever headless
[06:32] Prometheus: vagrant works well for that
[06:32] Prometheus: Windows, probably not so much
[06:33] Nuck: Joyent has put a lot of work into no.de and as such I have heard people call them the "king of Virtualized I/O"

[11:31] emacsen: daveluke,  in  most cirumstances, node isn't your limiting factor. But if it is, you can either run multiple instances on the same host, or run multiple hosts

[11:36] jrgp: yeah that gives me "TypeError: Object function String() { [native code] } has no method 'charCodeAt'"
[11:36] kkaefer: jrgp: wait...
[11:36] kkaefer: you have a charcode and you want the corresponding char as string?
[11:36] kkaefer: then use String.fromCharCode
[11:36] emacsen: btw anyone here use the redis module?
[11:36] kkaefer: if you want to get the code from a string, use str.charCodeAt
[11:37] jetienne: jrgp: node is normal javascript. use the normal function that you konw
[11:37] jrgp: ok "String.fromCharCode" works, thanks
[11:37] jrgp: yeah I'm gathering that
[11:37] hkjels: What is the name of the stylus library equivalent to compass? 
[11:38] daveluke: i want to create a multiplayer game with node js... how do i scale and allow for multiple simultaneous games
[11:38] emacsen: daveluke, "how do I scale" is too generic a question. What are you scaling?
[11:38] pigmej has joined the channel
[11:38] pigmej: hey
[11:38] pigmej: is there any string templating language ?
[11:39] daveluke: emacsen, like the way i did it was i had an array to hold game objects on the serverside
[11:39] pigmej: NOT HTML
[11:39] daveluke: that got messy though..
[11:39] mape: pigmej: jade?
[11:39] daveluke: and is a shitty idea
[11:39] industrial: pigmej: you can output anythinw with a template language, why would it have to be HTML?
[11:39] brianseeders has joined the channel
[11:39] pigmej: mape: no..
[11:39] pigmej: jade is HTML
[11:39] industrial: HTML is just what the client makes out of it
[11:39] pigmej: i want 'string formatting'
[11:39] industrial: sprintf ?
[11:39] emacsen: daveluke, I don't see what that has to do with scaling. What is your limiting factor that you're trying to scale?
[11:39] pigmej: industrial: to simple
[11:40] pigmej: i need something like jade but without 'html'
[11:40] pigmej: i found nTPL but it seems to be dead now
[11:40] mape: then just send the jade source to them and let them figure it out themselves?
[11:40] daveluke: emacsen, i just figured that using an array on the serverside javascript to store game data would exhaust in memory
[11:40] pigmej: well jade tries to make html from it *always*
[11:40] jbpros has joined the channel
[11:41] mape: so what is the output you want?
[11:41] emacsen: daveluke, it depends how big the array is, and your HW
[11:41] jrgp: can I catch errors that corrospond to invalid array keys?
[11:41] pigmej: mape: i want string output ;)
[11:41] pigmej: not html ;)
[11:41] jetienne: pigmej: new String()
[11:41] kkaefer: daveluke, emacsen, also v8 has a rough limit of about 1 GB of data in javascript land
[11:41] mape: then striptag the html?
[11:41] pigmej: mape:  too slow :P
[11:41] emacsen: daveluke, but that doesn't sound like a scaling issue. But again, when you talk about "scaling"- you need to know what your resource limits are
[11:42] mape: pigmej: then just send strigs?
[11:42] mape: *strings
[11:42] mape: and make sure they don't look like html!
[11:42] emacsen: kkaefer, right, so there's no way to know with so little information being presented
[11:42] pigmej: mape: I can't 
[11:42] pigmej: that's not the point
[11:42] emacsen: maybe it's a few kbytes of game data. Or maybe it's a gig. I have no idea :)

[11:43] pigmej: of my plain text template with variables ;)
[11:43] emacsen: kkaefer, nor is he teling me why running N instances of node won't just solve his "scaling" problem, as I said to him 10 mins ago :)
[11:43] jetienne: pigmej: well you had 5 answers, it is engouth no ?
[11:43] pigmej: to slow ;-)
[11:43] pigmej: jetienne: none was the answer for my problem :)
[11:43] pigmej: html => text == to slow
[11:43] jetienne: pigmej: they answered your question
[11:43] mape: html === text

[11:44] pigmej: emacsen: something like that
[11:44] pigmej: but with some conditional things also...
[11:44] pigmej: mape: i want 'string' not html
[11:44] pigmej: and I'm not sending result to a browser:P
[11:44] mape: then just send strings?
[11:45] emacsen: pigmej, then do what coffeescript does. If you want conditions, then USE A TEMPLATING ENGINE
[11:45] jetienne: i dont think he want an answer
[11:45] emacsen: who cares what you're sending it to. it's http! Set the mime type!
[11:45] mape: jetienne: But I have so many answers
[11:45] pigmej: damn...
[11:45] pigmej: guys...
[11:45] jetienne: mape: none will satisfy him i think
[11:45] pigmej: I don't want to send it to a browser
[11:45] pigmej: I want PLAIN TEXT
[11:45] pigmej: without HTML tags
[11:45] pigmej: etc
[11:45] jetienne: pigmej: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules#templating
[11:45] mape: pigmej: then send plain text?
[11:46] jetienne: pigmej: you got a bunch there, make your pick
[11:46] pigmej: mape: from what template?
[11:46] pigmej: jetienne: i searched...
[11:46] pigmej: 90% of them is dead
[11:46] pigmej: since year or more
[11:46] pigmej: then you have jade => not that what I wanted
[11:46] jetienne: pigmej: search better
[11:46] mape: pigmej: you want a "template" that isn't html? 
[11:46] pigmej: mape: yup
[11:46] pigmej: I'm trying to said that since beginning ;-)
[11:46] mape: and that template will be used for?
[11:46] pigmej: to generate plain text messages 
[11:46] pigmej: ;-)
[11:46] mape: Yeah, just that it isn't making any sense
[11:47] pigmej: WITHOUT HTML 
[11:47] pigmej: why ?
[11:47] tuhoojabotti: WITH XHTML
[11:47] tuhoojabotti: ":D"

[11:47] pigmej: emacsen: sure...
[11:48] mape: pigmej: then just send plain text without html or other markup things?
[11:48] pigmej: but I have no idea how to say that I dont want any tags there
[11:48] emacsen: pigmej, then if you understand that, you'll see why most templating engines will work for you. If you don't want tags, don't use any tags
[11:48] pigmej: emacsen: sure.. but
[11:48] jetienne: oh wait i got one in 20line :)
[11:48] pigmej: for example jade
[11:48] pigmej: is trying ALWAYS to make html
[11:48] emacsen: pigmej, okay, so jade won't work. Use another
[11:48] jetienne: pigmej: no

[13:33] mobius-: hi quick question. I have a synchronous server where I am sending a command and wait for the response. In node.js this is all done asyncronously where I call connection.write() and I get an event 'data' with the response. In order to make it work properly I though to store the last command executed so that I know how to parse the response on the 'data' emitted. Is this the node way to go?
[13:34] yhahn has joined the channel
[13:34] bnoordhuis: mobius-: yes, kind of
[13:34] bnoordhuis: mobius-: if you're familiar with state machines, that's the node approach

[13:36] bnoordhuis: mobius-: ehm... have a look at the source code of modules like node-irc

[14:35] rohit_nsit08: but now I'm getting error that "test" module is not present in node
[14:35] rohit_nsit08: after checking in /lib folder it is confirmed that it is not there

[18:36] context: nhq: im guessing nothing before connect was using the crypto lib.
[18:37] Yoric has joined the channel
[18:37] context: my simpliest answer will be, since you fail to answer questions asked, is you installed node from a package, which was compiled using a different version of openssl than you have.
[18:37] wossoya has joined the channel
[18:37] NHQ: @context i use the crypto lib for sha salts and hashed PWs

[18:38] slickplaid: bcrypt > sha
[18:38] context: this place is pissing me off today. very unusual :/
[18:39] NHQ: @jerrysc I compiled from source, yes. openssl was prebuilt on the OS, but I also tried building that from scratch and reconfiguring node accordingly
[18:39] NHQ: @context what question did I fail to answer?
[18:40] NHQ: @context @jerrysv I don't think it is an openssl problem at all, because I can use nodes crypto library just fine

[18:45] NHQ: @context i see. but okay, so I built a fresh openssl and reconfigured the node libpaths accordingly, but that didn't change anything
[18:45] context: nhq: recompile node.
[18:45] context: it has nothing to do with libpaths
[18:46] context: it has to do with symbols to dynamically linked libraries IN the binary itself.
[18:46] NHQ: @context copy that. will do
[18:46] jerrysv: and if you can, make sure the old copy of openssl is gone, but i have a feeling you won't be able to

[18:49] augustl: can q, the promise library, sequentially execute an array of functions that return promises, not executing the next function until the promise returned from the previous is resolved?
[18:49] seivan_: Guys, processing backgron jobs on a persistant queue
[18:49] seivan_: on Node, any ideas?
[18:49] augustl: seivan_: I've used ActiveMQ for that
[18:49] context: nhq: did gmake uninstall actually do anything is the question
[18:49] context: nhq: just gmake clean ; gmake install
[18:49] seivan_: augustl: any fast solution like resque or DJ from rails?

[18:50] seivan_: That library is such a kick-ass tool...
[18:51] NHQ: @context i just want to say that node asked for this by inviting front enders into the server party
[18:51] NHQ: ;)
[18:51] augustl: seivan_: the only website framework for node that has any traction is express, afaik
[18:51] context: node is not in blastwave... thats sad
[18:51] seivan_: augustl: No, it's not the website framework I want
[18:51] seivan_: Omniauth for rails (actually rack in general)
[18:51] augustl: dunno what omniauth does
[18:51] context: nhq: i have a package manager that prevents me from wasting my time
[18:51] seivan_: basically encapsulate logins for twitter, facebook, linkedin and etc into one neat package
[18:52] seivan_: Btw, do people use Express or just Node raw?
[18:52] EyePulp: seivan_: both
[18:52] NHQ: @context I can only learn how to use so many new things at one time. I glossed over various version managements, but I am still "flying by the seat of my pants"
[18:52] EyePulp: seivan_: usually depends on the complexity.
[18:53] augustl: seivan_: I've never used express but still use node a lot

[19:52] addisonj: and you are just doing a ./configure && make && sudo make install?
[19:52] wossoya: When I try to install node-proxy, amongst a few other errors, my system says: "Checking for node path: not found" Does anyone know how to resolve this?
[19:52] addisonj: because if that breaks on ubuntu 8.04+ then you probably have something funky in your install, maybe screwed up path
[19:53] wossoya: I'm using cygwin unfortunately
[19:53] NHQ: @addisonj export PATH=$HOME/local/node/bin:$PATH
[19:53] Mattpark: well yes, just --prefix 
[19:54] addisonj: ah... try it without prefix, and I bet you it will work

[19:55] NHQ: my error is looking for file /opt/local/bin/node, but my node path is ~/local/node/bin. How can I resolve that?
[19:55] Mattpark: hmm ok I'll try ^^
[19:55] context: nhq: just stop. figure out what your doing or higher someone to setup that vps.
[19:56] context: 5 minutes ago node was /opt/node
[19:56] wossoya: how do you set the node path?
[19:56] context: nhq: look in joyents help, im sure they have a damn package for node.

[20:05] Aiden: Hello everyone. Do any of you have experience with Mongoose?
[20:07] briznad has joined the channel
[20:08] NHQ: @context I searched the packages and it didn't list any node packages. nonetheless, I installed the one from their docs, and it installed 0.4.2, not 0.4.7. When I run node, then, it says the server is running, but the app is unresponsive. When I built it myself, the app ran fine (until I ran into the current problem). So using their package is taking several steps in the wrong direction

[20:15] bnoordhuis: NHQ: exact same issue? i.e. startup fails with 'node: symbol BIO_set_flags: referenced symbol not found'
[20:15] NHQ: @bnoordhuis i think it has something to do with relative paths, cuz is says its looking for file /opt/local/bin/node but the node path upon installation is /local/bin/node

[20:16] Aiden: I have a document that contains an array of embedded documents. Currently I have a schema defined for this document, but I want to have different types of documents in the list.

[20:18] bnoordhuis: NHQ: and this happens only after the first request?
[20:19] NHQ: yes
[20:19] bnoordhuis: NHQ: i think i told you to compile node yourself - did you?
[20:20] NHQ: @ bnoordhuis I did. I was using my own compilation in the first place
[20:21] bnoordhuis: NHQ: where is your version installed? i wager it's not /opt/local/bin/node
[20:21] wossoya has joined the channel
[20:21] NHQ: @bnoordhuis no it is not

[20:23] bnoordhuis: NHQ: what happens if you run your app with your version of node?

[20:24] NHQ: @bnoordhuis server starts. everything A-okay until I need crypto 
[20:24] devrim has joined the channel
[20:25] NHQ: @bnoordhuis ./configure reported Not Found for openssl, until I followed your advice and set the path for the new build of openssl
[20:25] NHQ: @bnoordhuis yet that didn't resolve the problem
[20:26] bnoordhuis: NHQ: do you run `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/path/to/openssl` before starting node?
[20:26] NHQ: @bnoordhuis yes I tried that as well
[20:27] bnoordhuis: NHQ: let's try this
[20:27] NHQ: it still looks for /opt/local/bin...
[20:27] bnoordhuis: NHQ: first, where does openssl.so live?

[20:30] jerrysv: still going i see
[20:30] NHQ: @bnoordhius there is no openssl.so in that directory, only openssl.pc, openssl.spec, openssl.doxy
[20:30] Yoric has joined the channel
[20:31] NHQ: @bnoordhuis https://gist.github.com/1081249
[20:32] bnoordhuis: NHQ: your node is linked against the system openssl, that's no good
[20:32] bnoordhuis: NHQ: download the openssl source tarball and build it with `./config shared`
[20:32] lukstr: ACTION pours context a drink, goes home
[20:33] NHQ: @bnoordhuis I did that when I built that version of openssl
[20:33] bnoordhuis: NHQ: well, you did something wrong - so try it again
[20:33] NHQ: ok
[20:34] bnoordhuis: NHQ: and for the record, build openssl in $HOME/src/openssl
[20:34] bnoordhuis: NHQ: makes the next part easier
[20:34] NHQ: do i need to uninstall the old one?

[21:19] erenon: the Foo  instance explicitly?
[21:21] NHQ: @bnoordhuis if i untarred it to $home/src, tho, how will --openssl-includes=$HOME/openssl/include work?
[21:21] taf2: erenon, i don't know for sure... but in JS if you call delete does that trigger your destructor?  or is it maybe the case that destructor isn't ever called for a reason?

[21:25] jerrysv: i know about that one, but no, it was another :)
[21:26] bnoordhuis: jerrysv: running the gc explicitly still doesn't guarantee that your c++ destructor will run
[21:27] jerrysv: bnoordhuis: no, but my thought was that if the destructor wouldn't be called until gc happens, you have a better chance of having it called if you forced gc
[21:27] bnoordhuis: jerrysv: right, that's true
[21:27] bnoordhuis: but if you want explicit guarantees, you need to side-step the gc

[21:45] context: 16:43        NHQ| @bnoordhuis is it because I am building as root user?
[21:45] context: 16:45        NHQ| @context permission is denied otherwise
[21:45] context: makes NO SENSE AT ALL !
[21:45] NHQ: @context i mean if i am not root, i can't build node.
[21:46] context: that makes no sense either.
[21:46] MarcinM: And is this syntax right? find(params, {limit:10, sort:['header', 'desc']})
[21:46] NHQ: @context tell that to the permission denied
[21:46] MarcinM: I can change what I sort by and it seems to be working - but changing asc or desc does nothing.
[21:46] context: nhq: "permission denied" is exactly like saying "it dont work" ... ZERO CONTEXT
[21:46] MarcinM: ^^ that's for christkv's mongodb-native
[21:47] context: nhq: serious, remove all those sources you have for openssl and node. if anything have the box wiped, you have no clue what you have placed where, overwritten, or ANYTHING
[21:47] context: you dont know what version of what is installed where and how many times
[21:47] brettgoulder has joined the channel
[21:48] context: you obviously have at least one version of node in /opt, probably one in $HOME and if you're lucky also in /usr/local
[21:48] NHQ: @context I uninstalled all node builds, got a freshie from the git repo like bnoordhuis said, re-configured openssl...
[21:48] NHQ: node only builds to /opt if i use the package
[21:48] NHQ: i uninstalled that package
[21:48] MarcinM: Hah, just found it. Should be sort:[['header', 'desc']] instead.
[21:48] context: nhq: if you want, add me a user, ill install node without root and/or see whats really wrong.
[21:49] MarcinM: If anyone else needs the syntax, I found the answer here: http://groups.google.com/group/node-mongodb-native/browse_thread/thread/fd618670dbd076fc

[22:14] EyePulp: ash___:  looks like @1.7.2
[22:14] EyePulp: I'm using npm (or trying)
[22:15] ash___: i installed version 1.6
[22:15] ash___: and didnt get this error
[22:15] NHQ: @context would root access help?
[22:15] malkomalko: is it possible to get the current route in an express middleware including params filled in? or can you res.redirect('back') from middleware? I don't think you can because there is no referrer
[22:15] EyePulp: ash___: interesting
[22:16] context: nhq: they should have a newer version but hold on
[22:16] ash___: EyePulp:

[22:20] malkomalko: res.redirect('back') works from middleware? I was getting undefined before in 2.3.11
[22:20] malkomalko: because it didn't have the referrer header
[22:21] tjholowaychuk: the referrer field has nothing to do with middleware
[22:21] tjholowaychuk: that's at the request level
[22:21] EyePulp: ash___: well there's node-mongodb-native, which mongoose lives on top of, and then there's the mongodb package.  
[22:21] estrathmeyer has left the channel
[22:21] ash___: i got mine working
[22:21] EyePulp: ash___:  unless they're migrating from one to the other...
[22:21] tjholowaychuk: but yeah express extends ServerResponse so you can use those methods whenever
[22:21] ash___: i did npm install mongodb -g first
[22:21] malkomalko: awesome
[22:21] ash___: then mongoose
[22:21] malkomalko: really loving middleware for all sorts of things
[22:21] malkomalko: param middleware rocks my world too
[22:22] tjholowaychuk: oddly enough that feature was inspired by drupal haha
[22:22] tjholowaychuk: maybe the only thing i took away from drupal
[22:22] tjholowaychuk: and that it's modules are far more modular than rail's shitty plugins
[22:22] EyePulp: ash___: yeah, it's failing even on its own.
[22:22] EyePulp: for me at least
[22:23] malkomalko: you can really abstract away a lot of formatting and conversion steps out of controllers, sanitization and everything like that

[23:20] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: Can I put a template in a template?
[23:20] Nuck: Cause I wanna have a template for a profile, then a template for each profile module inside it
[23:20] tjholowaychuk: Nuck I'd like to have it magically know which portion(s) should be considered a view when nested
[23:21] tjholowaychuk: but currently they should be separate
[23:21] Nuck: ah okay
[23:21] Nuck: Just wondering :D
[23:21] tjholowaychuk: it would be cool though
[23:21] tjholowaychuk: might be a little tough to make assumptions for those cases though
[23:21] tjholowaychuk: you can look at the profile example for ideas maybe
[23:21] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: I must say, however, that this is a level of JS magic rivaled only by LESS.
[23:21] materialdesigner has joined the channel
[23:22] tjholowaychuk: LESS is for css
[23:22] tjholowaychuk: i dont get it
[23:22] Murvin: have anyone tried to build an iPhone app that connect to a node.js server?
[23:22] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: The client-side LESS is pretty epic.
[23:22] tjholowaychuk: I think that's a terrible idea
[23:22] tjholowaychuk: why would you render css on the client
[23:22] tjholowaychuk: unless you're lazy
[23:22] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: It's useful for testing without a Node backend.
[23:22] tjholowaychuk: :p
[23:23] Nuck: That's my only purpose for it.  It's just so I can test easily on Windows with Apache
[23:24] Nuck: I gotta agree with you on the comment about jQuery code being spaghetti code.

[23:24] Nuck: But Caustic should help offset that.
[23:25] tjholowaychuk: yeah, I was always encapsulating
[23:25] tjholowaychuk: and I thought wtf... why am I doing this
[23:25] tjholowaychuk: the classes and tag types tell you most of that info
[23:26] tjholowaychuk: and client stuff is so dynamic I dont really see templates being much of a use
[23:26] tjholowaychuk: other than for large bodies of html
[23:26] tjholowaychuk: which, even for single-page apps is usually done on the SS
[23:27] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: I use EJS minimally for my current project, and that's just for the bodies of the various profile modules
[23:27] Nuck: Since that makes it a bit easier to extend.
[23:27] Nuck: The rest is all REST.
[23:28] Nuck: So anything that makes my View easier is good in my book :P

[23:29] tjholowaychuk: yeah, if you care about those sorts of things

[23:30] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: I hope to do AJAX like Facebook does.  Where they use normal URLS and links but just override it with JS.

[23:31] Prometheus: Nuck: progressive enhancement? =P
[23:31] Nuck: Prometheus: Actually, I'm using a lot of that stuff.
[23:31] Nuck: Like CSS3 transitions.
[23:31] Prometheus: what's the fallback for that?

[23:34] digiwano: css3 animations are fun too, just did a thing where i created an anim by manually creating and appending the css, then trigger the anim in js
[23:34] Nuck: I'm quite proud of the animations on that.
[23:34] digiwano: was super super simple and came out beautiful
[23:34] Nuck: digiwano: This just handles classes.
[23:34] Nuck: I just change the values on various things via classes and it moves.
[23:35] digiwano: yeah i've done it multiple ways now
[23:35] digiwano: a) with transitions and without js
[23:35] Nuck: I used currying to make the code reusable in this case.
[23:35] digiwano: b) by creating animations and class definitions on the fly and applying a class to trigger the anim
[23:36] digiwano: and c) creating animations only on the fly and manually applying the animation name property, then unsetting the anim name property by binding for anim end
[23:36] digiwano: after figuring out c, its by far my favorite

[23:49] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: I can't tell from the documentation, but can I do something like `<img src="img/blank.gif" style="background-image: url('icons/nuck');" height=50 width=50>` and have a way to set the uername in the background-image?
[23:50] tjholowaychuk: it doesn't add any methods for style related stuff
[23:50] tjholowaychuk: yet at least
[23:50] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: Ah, I meant more as a way to have a variable in an attribute
[23:51] tjholowaychuk: you can drop down to the element for more specific stuff, foo.el
[23:51] tjholowaychuk: which is a jQuery object
[23:51] Nuck: oh, that's awesome.

[23:51] tjholowaychuk: foo.el.css(blah blah)
[23:51] Nuck: That's good, I always love when there's easy ways to fall back to things I know :P

[23:52] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: I can see this being huge once it's complete, because this is a great idea.
[23:52] tjholowaychuk: thanks man, feel free to fire patterns my way, I'm going to keep building up the examples trying to cover everything
[23:53] digiwano: Nuck: my fallback had to be manual tween-based animation, i just used a variation of the ender-tween thing to pull that off
