[20:45] Raynos: richardr: I recommend you use express
[20:45] yobi: richardr: https://github.com/1602/express-on-railway
[20:45] yobi: didn't know about these
[20:45] Raynos: calipso is a CMS, if you need a CMS use one
[20:45] Raynos: you dont want railwayjs or express on railway
[20:45] Raynos: That simply ruins the point of node.
[20:45] Raynos: If you want rails use ruby on rails
[20:47] ekryski has joined the channel
[20:47] yobi: i would prefer expressjs for now
[20:48] Raynos: if you want help with writing proper application architecture then ask
[20:48] yobi: but i know people are having different preferences .. you can't just say you don't want them
[20:48] yobi: no its cool
[20:48] tomtomaso has joined the channel
[20:48] Raynos: yobi: I'd argue that those frameworks are too big and restrictive, it ruins the point of node being lightweight and close to the metal. 
[20:48] yobi: I agree
[20:49] Raynos: There are simply better options then node if you want a monolithic framework
[20:49] jtsnow has joined the channel
[20:49] masch has joined the channel
[20:49] yobi: but you wanna use JS
[20:49] richardr: Raynos: I know Calipso is a CMS, I meant the approach it takes in terms of architecture for its application. Should I use something along those lines, or use a framework like Railway?.
[20:49] masch: hi
[20:49] yobi: coffeescript on both ends
[20:49] masch: can someone pls tell me whats wrong here: http://pastebin.com/d05Z2ApJ ? i just try to keep that script running 
[20:49] yobi: i wouldnt say its a bad initiative .. it would for sure drive more traffic from RoR/Ruby to Node/JS world
[20:49] fly-away has joined the channel
[20:49] marcello3d: woo, mongolian has 130 watchers on github already :D
[20:49] Raynos: richardr: I'd argue you want to simply write modular code. Use express if you want
[20:49] yobi: just a good thing 
[20:50] richardr: Raynos: I fully understand Node intended to remove abstraction, but often having a framework reduces development time and helps people write more maintainable code.
[20:50] richardr: Raynos: Pretty much
[20:50] Raynos: I dont know why people need frameworks for structure, just write modular code
[20:50] yobi: and its always nice to see people build beautiful products even though it's not my cup of tea
[20:50] AAA_awright: marcello3d: It's a mongodb layer that doesn't suck, that's why
[20:50] Raynos: richardr: I'm in the middle of a big refactor, I'm going to blog about simple modular architecture in the future ;) Hopefully it will show people they dont need frameworks
[20:51] marcello3d: AAA_awright: :D it's not just a layer
[20:51] AAA_awright: Library thing
[20:51] robertj: how do i find out what pid im running as?
[20:51] yobi: Raynos: sometimes we want it because we think it will help
[20:51] AAA_awright: I've been calling everything layers and I don't know why...
[20:51] marcello3d: masch: take out 'start' maybe?
[20:51] richardr: Raynos: Is there any snippets or examples out there now? I am really looking to design an app with a modular architecture. Any help I can get would be highly appreciated
[20:51] Raynos: I presonally find every frameworks gets in the way rather then help
[20:51] yobi: maybe it won't .. we'll find our way one or another way
[20:51] masch: marcello3d: but i want to run it as a daemon
[20:51] yobi: i agree
[20:52] Raynos: richardr: its not done but  https://github.com/Raynos/raynos-blog
[20:52] yobi: Raynos: I even think ExpressJS is getting in the way sometimes :)
[20:52] ryanj has joined the channel
[20:52] marcello3d: masch: looks like a bug in forever then? it's trying to launch a program named 'start'
[20:52] yobi: I like it being small and node.js near
[20:52] Raynos: yobi: it does get in the way, but people keep writing code that plugs into express :\
[20:52] Raynos: so rather then using modules I have to use express middleware -.-
[20:52] masch: marcello3d: i think its a bug in how i use it O.o
[20:52] yobi: Raynos: I bet the guys are Rubyists 
[20:52] marcello3d: masch: don't know, I haven't used forever
[20:53] yobi: talking about Heroku all the time
[20:53] yobi: we should use Nodejitsu!
[20:53] Raynos: yobi: I've written my own view engine though \o/ just use express for middleware and routing
[20:53] marcello3d: there are a lot of ruby people trying to make node.js like ruby. *cough* coffeescript *cough*
[20:53] yobi: Raynos: those guys are having the same vision as you=)
[20:53] marcello3d: there's nothing wrong with that approach, but it's not the only one
[20:53] yobi: unix style .. small tools .. do one thing good
[20:53] yobi: Raynos: have you looked at hook.io and flatiron?

[20:57] richardr: Raynos: What do you think of this: https://github.com/cliftonc/express-mvc-bootstrap ?
[20:57] Raynos: richardr: expressling, node-express-boilerplate
[20:57] yobi: Raynos: also with coffeescript its reminding them about Ruby .. if not even cleaner
[20:58] aaronmcadam has joined the channel
[20:58] Raynos: yobi: coffeescript is the devil.
[20:58] yobi: Raynos: you can have the most sophisticated system but you have to market it well

[20:59] Raynos: yobi: Sorry? 
[20:59] richardr: Raynos: that's not mine, just something I found that looks like a useful base ?
[20:59] yobi: Raynos: ah nothing . just talking =)
[20:59] Raynos: richardr: My opinion on boilerplates is they are great to read horrible to use
[20:59] Raynos: I use boilerplates to "learn" about techinques people are using
[20:59] Raynos: I dont build my app of them
[21:00] Raynos: the boilerplate express creates is enough
[21:00] chjj: Raynos: agreed
[21:00] chapel: richardr: checkout https://github.com/niftylettuce/expressling
[21:00] chjj: Raynos: also, if the boilerplate has a flaw in it, that flaw will get replicated thousands of times due to people mindlessly using it
[21:00] yobi: richardr: the mvc bootstrap isn't maintained

[21:26] defunctzombie: before being able to build/test the source
[21:26] marcello3d: well it has sudo access and it uses npm, so if it's a standard npm module, maybe it just works?
[21:26] defunctzombie: it is not

[21:26] defunctzombie: libxmljs is a wrapper around it

[21:27] marcello3d: well you can define a script on travis to run before the test
[21:27] defunctzombie: really no point to build our own
[21:28] marcello3d: so if the vm doesn't have libxml2-dev already, I guess you could write a shell script to install it
[21:28] defunctzombie: right, but I wonder what script I would need to pull down the package
[21:28] defunctzombie: do you know what OS the vms are?
[21:28] yobi: what does "npm install -l" mean?

[23:07] braoru has joined the channel

[23:17] richardr: What does the Node.JS community think of Cloud9 as an IDE? Curious
[23:17] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: fixed that test, btw
[23:17] mmalecki: richardr: they don't embed vim, so it's not for me

[23:36] rob16299: exec('id -G | sed -E "s/ .*//g"', function(serror, stdout, stderr)
[23:36] rob16299: its not my code, so Im unsure what this is doing, but the comment is: Create Flash socket policy file server if running as root.
[23:37] rob16299: do you think this might be a permission issue?

[23:50] marcello3d: rob16299: don't use 0.4.7 and cygwin?
[23:51] rob16299: ya ive tried a few different versions of node and this is the one that worked on my 32bit machine, im not sure
[23:52] brianseeders has joined the channel
[23:52] rob16299: i also tried node for windows, and it didnt work in different ways with the platform im working on, they dont support the windows version
[23:53] rob16299: do you know what that exec statement is actually achieving? then i can see if its possibly permissions or some broken cygwin app

[23:58] defunctzombie: also, use node 0.6.x as it is the current stable
[23:59] rob16299: unfortunately i cant go above 5, since cygwin isnt supported
[23:59] rob16299: this is what its trying to do on the line, any ideas "Create Flash socket policy file server if running as root."
[23:59] alejandromg: Why you need support for Cygwin?
