[00:00] Brandon_R_ has joined the channel
[00:00] AvianFlu: Xeon06, best to ask here
[00:01] Xeon06: Is there any way to force NPM to update it's packages? I have installed something and the GitRepo of said thing has a more recent version
[00:01] Xeon06: Not sure how that's handled, maybe the authors themselves need to update their packages
[00:01] insin has left the channel
[00:01] Aria: If you're pulling from the registry, the authors have to publish
[00:01] Aria: However, you can change your package.json to refer to the git repo and npm can pull straight from it.
[00:02] Xeon06: Aria, my "package.json"?

[00:03] Brandon_R_: what do you guys think of javascript design patterns?
[00:03] Aria: Brandon_R_: Design patterns happen.
[00:03] Brandon_R_: do they hold much weight in js or are they not necessary?
[00:03] Brandon_R_: like facade or factory
[00:03] Aria: Are you thinking of a specific design pattern?
[00:03] Brandon_R_: singleton
[00:03] cmr: Brandon_R_: IMO they don't hold much weight anywhere... most of them are common sense type things, not to be overly thought about.
[00:03] Aria: The patterns one needs to combat weaknesses in languages vary by language.
[00:04] Aria: So if you're thinking patterns in Patterns of Enterprise Architecture, you're trying to write Java in Javascript.
[00:04] Aria: But you WILL find a lot of design patterns in Javascript code. Because patterns /happen/
[00:04] Aria: They're not something you should go looking to apply, but recognize when you're doing and do in the best possible way.
[00:04] Industrial has joined the channel
[00:05] Aria: Xeon06: You usually make a package.json for what you're building, and you list your dependencies there.
[00:05] Aria: Xeon06: But if you're installing packages, npm install giturl
[00:06] Xeon06: Oh, that makes it easier
[00:06] Brandon_R_: cool so npm can install from git?
[00:06] Aria: Yes it can.
[00:06] Aria: For better and worse.

[00:20] jbrokc: hey, what's the easiest way to update my install of node with homebrew from 0.4.10 to 0.6.1? i need to install serveup which requires strata which needs node ~ 0.6.1 :(
[00:21] isaacs_away: If you list a git url as a dependency, you should strongly consider supplying a branch, tag, or commit
[00:22] Aria: jbrokc: git clone, git checkout v0.6; ./configure; make; make install
[00:22] Aria: jbrokc: or alternatively, brew edit node
[00:23] jbrokc: Aria: what's the url for the tar.gz file? just change the extension to 0.6.1 or 0.6.01 ?
[00:23] jbrokc: and will that upgrade node safely  (just trying to install over it)?
[00:23] Aria: 0.6.4

[00:33] SubStack: I also find vows pretty unappealing
[00:33] Raynos: I was tempted by tap, I need to learn more about it
[00:33] joshsmith_: Yeah I saw vows-is, but have you seen vows-bdd?
[00:33] mmalecki: Xeon06: why?
[00:33] Sorella: Xeon06, perhaps.
[00:34] Sorella: I guess Harmony is introducing structs or something.
[00:34] SubStack: Raynos: there's not much to learn, it's just the assert api bound to an object then you call t.end()
[00:34] Sorella: It's really introducing lots of things.
[00:34] SubStack: Raynos: pretty much node-tap except you call test() instead of doing an export
[00:34] Xeon06: mmalecki, Ton of reasons. Have you ever tried working with say a Vector2 object in JS? Needing to call .copy every time you pass it to make sure you don't modify that value
[00:34] joshsmith_: I don't like the syntax but vows.bdd is nice and matches up with my mental model
[00:34] SubStack: erm
[00:34] Raynos: SubStack: it's more learning about what tap outputs and what the default TAP stuff is. Cause its a protocol thing
[00:34] SubStack: *pretty much nodeunit
[00:34] SubStack: except you do asserts on the t object, not from the global assert module
[00:35] Raynos: joshsmith_ vows-is & vows-fluent was me going "hmm vows-bdd" dont like that, write my own
[00:35] SubStack: Raynos: I have no idea about any of that and I use tap all the time
[00:35] Raynos: I tried vows-bdd. Neglected it, and wrote my own
[00:35] Raynos: SubStack: im comfortable with nodeunit for the moment :)

[01:05] benvie: you can grant yourself permission though

[02:03] maushu: You mean client side? Server side?
[02:03] msch: maushu: server side. i've found a few client side cocoa websocket libraries, but after reading some socket.io docs it appears it builds ping/pong and other features on top of websockets, which the cocoa libs almost certainly won't support
[02:03] teadict: why not use socket.io nad support it?
[02:04] maushu: Hmm. I think I have something like that around.
[02:04] maushu: Even for client side for non-supporting browsers.
[02:05] maushu: But aren't there modules in the module library? I remember seeing a couple.
[02:05] msch: maushu: modules library? sorry, i'm totally new to node

[03:26] fastest963: Raynos: I can usually find the error by looking at the code but if I can't, then I use console.log.
[03:26] Raynos: "looking at the code" 
[03:26] Raynos: do you have some magical skill set
[03:26] fastest963: If you use try catch, be sure to print the e.stack
[03:27] fastest963: so you can figure out where it occured, that will usually help
[03:27] Raynos: I guess it depends what kind of error were talking about, run-time syntax errors are easy to fix
[03:27] joshkehn has joined the channel
[03:27] Raynos: I'm mainly thinking methods dont behave as I expect, whats going wrong.
[03:27] Raynos: Also why would I use try catch :( it's evil
[03:28] fastest963: It's evil? what do you mean?
[03:29] Raynos: why would you ever throw an error to be caught
[03:29] Raynos: you pass errors through callbacks
[03:29] Raynos: its the node way
[03:30] Raynos: I mean you can use try catch in certain libraries (like test runners), but I dont use it in application code
[03:31] saikat has joined the channel
[03:31] fastest963: maybe its just me but most of the time when I want to debug something its because I didn't expect an error to happen where it did. It's not because i expected an error to be there and returned.
[03:32] lwille has joined the channel
[03:32] Raynos: I dont wrap code in try & catch when I debug
[03:32] fastest963: instead you use console.log
[03:33] Raynos: yes, as in I log the state of data as it flows through the program
[03:33] Raynos: and I log pointers like "here" and "there" and "descriptive name"
[03:33] Raynos: You know all the things you would use breakpoints for and looking at the local variables stack
[03:34] fastest963: ya, gotcha. I rately debug changes to a variable, I guess because I don't run into problems that require that.

[05:33] knifed_ has joined the channel
[05:34] SubStack: JakeSays: it's super great for that and it's even better at streaming requests and responses
[05:34] Aria: JakeSays: the built-in http server? Express? So many options.
[05:34] SubStack: JakeSays: usually you just JSON.parse() and JSON.string() the requests and results
[05:34] SubStack: although if you have streaming JSON data you could use JSONStream
[05:35] SubStack: I wonder why more people don't do streaming ajax
[05:35] JakeSays: cool. sounds like it'll work. 
[05:35] SubStack: all the browsers except for the IEs support it, just set the content-type to multipart/octet-stream
[05:35] JakeSays: i'm gonna use it to mock a web service
[05:35] SubStack: then http-browserify makes the api just like node's
[05:35] SubStack: I should port request to browserify

[05:48] Leemp3: It seems easy so far (i can curl 127.0.0.1:3000 and get a response), i just can't get it to work from outside of my localhost lol
[05:48] JakeSays: which platform are you on?
[05:48] Leemp3: I'm hoping it's my version of node.. ubuntu seems to only be running 0.4.9
[05:48] JakeSays: c9 uses a very old version of node (.2 something)
[05:49] Renegade001 has joined the channel
[05:49] Leemp3: But yea, my end goal is to somehow run Cloud9 locally, so i can run binary extensions.. eg, so i can use JSDOM, etc.
[05:50] Leemp3: And wow, good to know. I'll try grabbing an older version and compiling it
[05:50] JakeSays: isnt node in the c9 repo?
[05:51] Leemp3: Not sure, i have the repo, but i never saw it. To run it you simply run bin/cloud9.sh, so i never even saw node.. 
[05:51] JakeSays: ah ok

[06:05] Leemp3: gkatsev: The cloud9 readme says "bin/cloud9.sh -l all" if you want to run  cloud9 on all addresses, but that gives the above error

[06:13] JakeSays: download the image locally and try it
[06:13] kerigan: how do I wait :S
[06:14] JakeSays: well, in a browser you can do img.load = function(){}
[06:14] JakeSays: not sure if its the same node side
[06:17] plantian has joined the channel
[06:17] gkatsev: yeah, node-canvas doesn't allow you to do that
[06:18] JakeSays: kerigan: if you're going to be doing a lot of canvas stuff server side node-canvas might not be the best option
[06:18] gkatsev: if you are loading from the filesystem, you can just read the file and then set the source to that variable. like in the node-canvas examples
[06:19] kerigan: yeah goat I've seen that example, but my images are on amazon s3
[06:20] kerigan: i mean gkat, lol lain auto correct need to turn that off
[06:20] OSInet has joined the channel
[06:20] gkatsev: you can do the same thing, more or less too. get the image via an http request
[06:20] gkatsev: then set the src to be that variable

[06:32] msch: what's the position on extending inbuild prototypes? e.g. adding Array.prototype.remove and stuff? Is there something like ruby's activesupport for node?
[06:34] JakeSays: msch: the position? 
[06:34] msch: JakeSays: what do more experienced node devs say about it?
[06:34] gkatsev: msch: you can do whatever you want. Generally, you want to avoid augmenting the default prototypes, but if you really want to, go ahead. If you break shit, dont blame us.
[06:34] _dc has joined the channel
[06:34] JakeSays: msch: its just javascript.. 
[06:35] msch: JakeSays: yeah and to this day i don't understand what's bad about extending the inbuild prototypes. everyone does it in objective c and ruby without blowing everything up
[06:35] micheil has joined the channel
[06:35] necromancer: msch: because in javascript, if two libraries override the same method...one of them is going to work and the other is not
[06:36] JakeSays: msch: it gets messy when you have 50 different 3rd party libs adding Array.remove()
[06:36] necromancer: actually that's the same with ruby and obj-c too :)
[06:36] necromancer: msch: so if you're just doing this for your own project and not planning to release it as a library, i'd say you're safe if you really want to do it
[06:36] nerdy_ has joined the channel
[06:36] necromancer: or if you really need to
[06:36] msch: i want to :)
[06:36] necromancer: but definitely don't if you're making a library that other people are going to use
[06:36] msch: yeah obviously
[06:37] msch: just like in every other lang
[06:37] gkatsev: if you do plan to make it a lib, have a compatability function that removes the functions from default prototypes and instead adds it to some namespace.
[06:37] msch: i was just wondering if there's something like activesupport that gives me more complete prototypes without me having to code them all myself
[06:37] msch: i'm writing an app
[06:38] kerigan: weird still getting Error: Image given has not completed loading with local files
[06:38] ryanj has joined the channel
[06:38] necromancer: msch: the "rule" of not augmenting prototypes in JS was really due to its status as a browser language. since there were several different implementations of the language your code could possibly be executed on, people had to be a little more careful about what they did.
[06:38] necromancer: it's part of the reason why prototype.js failed and jQuery succeeded. jQuery didn't extend the DOM, it wrapped the DOM node in its own object.
[06:39] necromancer: not sure why it's adhered to in the commonjs/node/v8 community though.
[06:39] msch: ok
[06:39] msch: necromancer: thanks.
[06:39] gkatsev: necromancer: because node is still js. I think it's a good practice and should be avoid unless You Know What You Are Doing(tm).
[06:40] JakeSays: kerigan: yeah i never had much luck with node-canvas (and come to think of it, most of my issues were with images)
[06:40] necromancer: I agree
[06:40] necromancer: there are very few reasons for why you need to extend built-in objects
[06:40] necromancer: however, the fact that you can do that is still awesome
[06:40] msch: there's only one right? readability
[06:40] necromancer: partially
[06:40] JakeSays: its like people adding classes to the System namespace in c#. it really bugs me
[06:40] gkatsev: though, sugarjs is a pretty cool
[06:40] Leemp2 has joined the channel
[06:41] JakeSays: msch: i'd argue it doesnt help with readability

[06:41] gkatsev: msch: haha, you're welcome.

[06:42] necromancer: msch: that is one. efficiency is another.
[06:42] satyr has joined the channel
[06:42] gkatsev: oh, I guess sugar exists as an npm module
[06:42] msch: JakeSays: how is something.pluck('whatever').include(somethingelse) less clear than _.include(_.pluck(something, 'whatever'), somethingelse) ?
[06:43] necromancer: it's more efficient, I think, to extend the Date object to allow it to accept a date string of "m/d/y" because you don't have to instantiate another object in order to get what you want out of the function
[06:43] JakeSays: msch: because when i to go read the docs on something, i expect to find something.pluck
[06:44] JakeSays: which i wouldn't because its some hack someone added t pluck
[06:44] JakeSays: er, to something
[06:44] necromancer: otherwise you'd have to make a function that takes a string, parses it, and instantiates a Date with those values
[06:44] ditesh|cassini has joined the channel
[06:44] necromancer: but if you wanted to change the Date to the value of the string, you'd actually have to overwrite it rather than change the object's properties
[06:44] JakeSays: msch: i'd also argue that _ is a piss poor name for, well, anything
[06:45] necromancer: JakeSays: $ was taken ;)
[06:45] JakeSays: necromancer: $ is just as poor
[06:45] gkatsev: underscore is pretty cool
[06:45] diogogmt has joined the channel
[06:45] necromancer: $ at least is familiar
[06:45] JakeSays: gkatsev: underscore is handy, but _ sucks ass as a name
[06:45] JakeSays: so does $
[06:45] gkatsev: $ is techinically missused as a variable name
[06:45] maletor has joined the channel
[06:45] necromancer: it serves a purpose?
[06:46] gkatsev: well, kind of
[06:46] JakeSays: what purpose?
[06:46] gkatsev: it's supposed to represent a variable holding machine code
[06:46] msch: JakeSays: well that's a problem with the documentation browser :) Xcode got it pretty right with support for category methods
[06:46] gkatsev: or something like that
[06:46] JakeSays: msch: i dont use xcode
[06:47] msch: JakeSays: yeah but what i meant is that it's a problem that can be solved by extending the tools
[06:47] msch: JakeSays: since you probably only have 2-3 different pluck methods in your whole codebase
[06:48] JakeSays: msch: i'd rather the library be written/documented properly
[06:48] msch: JakeSays: btw, what documentation browser do you use?
[06:48] JakeSays: ah.. i use everal
[06:48] JakeSays: *several
[06:48] gkatsev: a web browser
[06:48] JakeSays: ^
[06:49] JakeSays: for everything but ms docs, yeah, a browser
[06:49] necromancer: gkatsev: how can you write machine code in a language built to run in a high-level virtual machine?
[06:49] JakeSays: necromancer: with jslinux. lol
[06:49] msch: hehe, i meant the node equivalent of rdoc.info vs ruby-doc.org vs some native app whatever
[06:49] necromancer: bash uses it to represent all vars, as does perl and php
[06:50] JakeSays: msch: uh, i just use the web site docs for whatever lib i'm using.. not sure what you're asking
[06:50] msch: JakeSays: i was looking for some documentation aggregation pages where i can search through many npm libs at once
[06:50] JakeSays: ah
[06:51] JakeSays: no idea. i just started using npm (literally 10 minutes ago)
[06:51] necromancer: i always thought JS included it as an optional character in variables so php programmers would feel more comfortable
[06:51] JakeSays: necromancer: i figured it was because it was valid in c++
[06:51] jhurliman: it's completely untested (still haven't chosen a favorite unit testing library with node.js), but i just finished the first version of my rate limiting library. https://github.com/jhurliman/node-rate-limiter
[06:52] necromancer: oh yeah i guess that makes more sense
[06:52] kenperkins has joined the channel
[06:53] gkatsev: necromancer: ah, the machine and the code parts were both correct. just not together. $ is supposed to be used by machine generated javascript code so it will be less likely to interfere with other identifiers

[07:04] JakeSays: but you should really be asking the question "should i be mocking a service layer"
[07:04] joshsmith: that's kind of the way I've gone before, but I want to get my theory straight here
[07:04] JakeSays: you should always put your db behind a service layer
[07:05] joshsmith: JakeSays: how do you mean?
[07:05] jakehow has joined the channel
[07:05] joshsmith: (assume I'm stupid and just go from there)
[07:05] JakeSays: well, you should have a dal or orm between your code and the db
[07:06] JakeSays: to abstract your business logic from the db schema
[07:06] joshsmith: I'm using Postgres, so idk what kind of layer I would have

[09:37] elliottcable: How does on generally build a Node module?
[09:37] SubStack: and seen that handle in this channel before
[09:37] elliottcable: I've git-cloned node-ncurses, but I've no idea how to go about building it.
[09:37] mmalecki: *mscdex
[09:37] elliottcable: Too used to `rake make` or similar
[09:37] elliottcable: mmalecki: thanks. I'll catch him when he awakes, then
[09:38] SubStack: elliottcable: write an index.js with some exports
[09:38] SubStack: then write a package.json for it
[09:38] SubStack: then npm publish
[09:38] SubStack: and write tests if you're awesome
[09:38] elliottcable: hm, so just `npm publish` in his directory?
[09:38] elliottcable: I was trying to do this *without* NPM
[09:38] SubStack: a pull request?
[09:38] elliottcable: because `npm install ncurses` is how I was running into this problems previously

[09:39] adambeynon has joined the channel
[09:39] SubStack: npm install .
[09:39] elliottcable: I'm trying to install node-ncurses. It failed. Now, I've cloned the code, and want to experiment with building it by hand, but can't figure out how.
[09:39] SubStack: if it has a scripts.install in the package.json
[09:39] SubStack: otherwise node-waf clean build
[09:40] elliottcable: mmmmm good, `node-waf configure build` in the package.json, so I can just use that?
[09:40] elliottcable: good, good
[09:40] SubStack: if node-waf even still works
[09:40] elliottcable: thanks SubStack :D
[09:40] elliottcable: even still works? :x
[09:40] mmalecki: it's going to get replaced by gyp
[09:41] elliottcable: Heh. Build-tool shenanigans.
[09:41] elliottcable: okay now *that's* annoying.
[09:41] elliottcable: `CC=gcc node-waf configure build` completes successfully.
[09:42] elliottcable: and yet the `CC=gcc npm install ncurses` failed, the build fell apart for reasons that were unclear.
[09:42] ecin_ has joined the channel
[09:42] elliottcable: mmm, might just be a difference in the versions. Beyond downloading the source to node_modules and running the pre-install build, is there anything else npm does that I need to be aware of?
[09:42] magnetik has joined the channel
[09:42] elliottcable: or, to turn my question on its head: can I simply clone his code into node_modules by hand, run the build manually, and then be done?
[09:44] jbpros has joined the channel
[09:44] elliottcable: Hmmmm. No, npm must do something else as well; building with node-waf by hand doesn't spit out the ncurses_addon that his index file require()'s...

[16:08] hackband has joined the channel
[16:08] megalomix: is it possible to create a custom async function in Node? I mean something like:    mymodule.myfunction(param1, param2, function(){ .. })
[16:09] megalomix: How can i create "myfunction" function ? (Aync)
[16:09] Brandon_R: hi
[16:10] Sorella: megalomix, a function is always blocking. Whether it'll execute asynchronous work or not depends on what functions you call inside of it.
[16:10] megalomix: HI Brandon_R 
[16:10] megalomix: ?
[16:10] megalomix: Sorella, I didn't understand
[16:11] Sorella: megalomix, I mean that there's no special way to "declare" an asynchronous function. It all depends on the functions you call inside of that.
[16:11] CarterL has joined the channel
[16:11] megalomix: Sorella, yes sure, you are right...BUT the problem is that when I call that function the rest of the code will be processed and WHEN that function will finish the job the code inside { ... } will be executed
[16:11] megalomix: i mean that
[16:12] Sorella: For example: function foo(x, y){ return x + y }; is synchronous. Whereas function foo(x, y){ setTimeout(function(){ global_callback(x + y) }, 100) } is asynchronous.
[16:13] megalomix: Sorella,  yes but
[16:13] megalomix: one moment

[16:13] megalomix: I try to explain with a code
[16:13] braoru has joined the channel
[16:13] koo1 has joined the channel
[16:14] Sorella: you can do `process.nextTick(callback)' to schedule some function to run at the next tick of the event loop, which is equivalent to setTimeout(callback, 0) in Browsers, but more efficient.

[18:40] mmalecki: isaacs: fair enough

[18:43] stride: openid is more like a book full of visa cards and a funny guessing game which one you used the last time
[18:43] mmalecki: like things which need cental authority but can't share db, etc.
[18:43] isaacs: sso is a nice ideal.  i'm not saying it's not.  but every relevant openid-ish implementation that doesn't suck is using a proprietary system of some sort.
[18:43] isaacs: stride: exactly!
[18:43] isaacs: it's the kind of solution that only solves the problem by assuming that you don't already have the problem.
[18:44] isaacs: but i already have a jillion accounts, and all of them are openid providers, so should i use google, or yahoo, or facebook, or myopenid, or what?
[18:44] daGrevis: about my problem. i read this (http://www.thecodinghumanist.com/blog/archives/2011/5/6/serving-static-files-from-node-js) article. i understand now. i could figure the soltion out myself, but i didn't think that i need to do it. whatever, now i know :)

[19:00] mmalecki: https://github.com/mmalecki/nodejs-vs-ror is mvvm, lol
[19:00] dreamdust: Is there any project like knockout.js but that is working on making the templates "reflective"… so instead of <p data-bind="user.name"></p> I would just do <p>{{user.name}}</p> or something to that effect?
[19:00] isaacs: stride: sorry, vague joke.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrwO8b9iq34
[19:01] swaj: dreamdust: backbone with mustache templates?
[19:01] swaj: that said, knockout with jquery templates could so something very similar
[19:01] stride: isaacs: oh, I should have understood that. meh :)
[19:01] dreamdust: swaj: That's not reflective, you would have to declare the binding.
[19:02] isaacs: stride: i love that song, actually.  not because it's a good song -- it's terrible.  but it's the most over the top, happiest sounding thing, and he just casually throws in "I wanna die" occasionally
[19:02] dreamdust: I'm talkign something that automatically binds but without using the "data-bind" attribute, essentially a new kind of template language built for ViewModels

[23:16] avi_flax: code here: https://gist.github.com/1431609
[23:17] avi_flax: I make a request like this:    curl -i -# -o /dev/null http://localhost:3000/
[23:17] avi_flax: and my node program show 100% progress when curl is showing only about 50%
[23:17] avi_flax: basically the node progress is "hasty" — it goes much faster than the actual transfer

[23:21] eeemsi: *can't find…
[23:21] avi_flax: eemsi what error are you getting?
[23:21] djcoin: Hi all, a more 'javascript' than node question; Differences between new Array and Array(), is Array() okay ?
[23:21] eeemsi: avi_flax: events.js:48
[23:21] eeemsi:         throw arguments[1]; // Unhandled 'error' event
[23:21] eeemsi:                        ^
[23:21] eeemsi: Error: SQLITE_ERROR: SQL logic error or missing database
[23:22] avi_flax: eemsi: can you paste the whole stack trace/
[23:22] thepatr1ck: djcoin: no difference as far as I recall, but you might as well just use []
[23:23] eeemsi: avi_flax: thats it
[23:23] djcoin: thepatr1ck: yep, I do use [] and {}, but Array is a function, so that can be pretty handy
[23:25] avi_flax: eeemsi: well it looks like your program is only trying to create the DB

[23:25] whotemp has left the channel
[23:25] djcoin: bye, thanks for the answer thepatr1ck 
[23:25] eeemsi: avi_flax: oh wait… what?
[23:25] avi_flax: so I'd suggest checking the docs for that sqlite lib, to see how it's supposed to be used
[23:25] djcoin: g2g
[23:26] avi_flax: eeemsi: unless I'm seeing this wrong, the only function you're calling is goforit, which only calls create_db and then the program is done
[23:27] eeemsi: avi_flax: no its not done by then
[23:27] eeemsi: it is calling create_table and insert_db. it stops at the output of "started reading from the database"
[23:28] avi_flax: eeemsi: maybe i'm missing something but on line 49 you call goforit() which calls create_db() and create_db() doesn't call anything else
[23:28] avi_flax: oh wait
[23:28] avi_flax: i am missing something
[23:28] avi_flax: the callback
[23:28] avi_flax: sorry
[23:28] eeemsi: hey we thought the same (oh wait)

[23:30] avi_flax: eeemsi: I don't know sqlite well but that looks like invalid SQL
