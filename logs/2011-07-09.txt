[01:13] malkomalko has joined the channel
[01:13] isaacs: brainproxy: nopt is more about validation than parsing, really, but it is also a parser.  nomnom has a help-banner-generator thing, and i think does a bit of app-routing

[01:13] jesusabdullah: nopt sounded pretty sweet
[01:13] isaacs: and it has a cool name :)
[01:14] jesusabdullah: I've used optimist a few times, it's real slick for simple cli interfaces

[01:56] iamanewb: Hello all - I have a question about tls/https.  If I follow the example in the documentation (http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.9/api/https.html), I have found that the server object also listens on port 80, while the HTTPS service listens on the port actually specified (e.g., 8000 in the example).  Is there a way to avoid this?
[01:57] iamanewb: It causes two problems.  1., I have to be root to listen on a low port (below 1024 I think), and 2. it conflicts with any existing http server that is already using port 80 (e.g., apache).
[01:57] Aria: Which example?
[01:58] iamanewb: The first one.
[01:58] jacobolus has joined the channel
[01:58] iamanewb: On that page that I linked to.
[02:00] CrypticSwarm has joined the channel
[02:00] daveyjoe has joined the channel
[02:00] iamanewb: oops, you know what...it seems that it's socket.io causing the problem.
[02:01] iamanewb: I think I need to rethink this a bit.
[02:04] mbrevoort has joined the channel
[02:06] iamanewb: Yeah, so if I create a socket.io object like so: "var io = require('socket.io').listen(server);", where server is created from an https.createServer() call as in the example mentioned above, it ends up doing something that opens on port 80.
[02:06] jerrysv: ACTION waits for the day for iamanewb to switch over to iamapro
[02:07] iamanewb: thanks...it'll probably never happen.  :)
[02:07] Melkor_ has joined the channel
[02:07] jerrysv: iamanewb: so, instead: require('socket.io').listen(8000);
[02:07] iamanewb: Yeah, but I want an https connection, not http
[02:07] jesusabdullah: Pretty much no such thing as a true pro anyway imo
[02:07] jesusabdullah: go with <likeaboss> instead
[02:08] dleonardi: i usually just type "cornholio" and win
[02:08] iamanewb: jesusabdullah, agreed - there's always something new that I don't know anything about.
[02:08] jerrysv: ok, https on 8443, socket.io on 8000
[02:08] Melkor_: Any mongoose experts? How do I do a find with a json object and force it to do a contains search... ie find({name: /sam/})
[02:08] iamanewb: Ok...but I want socket.io to be on the https connection...
[02:09] jerrysv: i do not know if that is possible
[02:09] iamanewb: As-in, clients communicate to a socket.io listener via https.
[02:09] jerrysv: have you tried joining #socket.io ?

[02:29] iamapro: Got it working
[02:29] iamapro: :)
[02:30] chjj: cool
[02:30] iamapro: First, I have to make sure the server does not listen before I connect the socket.io object to it.
[02:30] iamapro: If I tell the https object to listen first, then tell io to listen to the https after that, for some reason it wants to open a new listener on port 80.
[02:31] chjj: yeah socket.io does some tricky stuff with the server object
[02:31] iamapro: Maybe a bug...I don't know.

[11:18] saschagehlich: Artem_S: how large is that file?
[11:19] `3rdEden: saschagehlich isn't jquery already using the request animation frame thing?

[11:52] dexter_e:   (function($){   /*AppPartsHere*/  })(jQuery);    
[11:53] dexter_e: Why passing $ and jQuery ?
[11:54] dexter_e: So its instantly defining and calling function($)
[11:54] Yoric: dexter_e: there are two reasons.
[11:55] Yoric: The first reason to use a function is to ensure that you don't pollute the global scope with local variables.
[11:56] Yoric: Let me check that I am not saying anything stupid about the second reason :)
[11:56] theCole has joined the channel
[11:58] Yoric: As I suspected, the reason for which [jQuery] is renamed to [$] in this function call is pretty much for concision.
[11:59] dexter_e: at the top level it looks like  (function(){})()   ...
[11:59] Yoric: (and because that's how jQuery tutorials do this kind of stuff)
[11:59] Yoric: dexter_e: yeah, that would work, too
[12:00] dexter_e: so the first set of parens declares the function and instantly calls it with the second set of parents as the parameter?

[13:12] zilch: Aria, what came to my mind is google doc ... but anythin else is fine...
[13:12] Aria: ACTION nods.
[13:13] Aria: I mean, the relatively normal way to do that is to make a little script that reads the database, then throw things in a database. Be it MySQL or Mongodb.
[13:13] zilch: basicallt it is a daily report .. a document gets a new line everyday
[13:13] Aria: But Google Docs isn't a bad hack for that either.

[13:30] localhost has joined the channel

[13:31] stagas has joined the channel
[13:31] txxt: or use readSync could be an option ?
[13:31] txxt: readFileSync, i ment
[13:31] txxt: *ment/meant
[13:31] mega`: if you are using sync in http responses your kinda missing the point of node
[13:32] mega`: the point is to not wait for the file
[13:32] mega`: and use a callback for when the file is done
[13:33] txxt: right, that is the point i don't want to miss. just wanted to keep the code more readable 
[13:33] mega`: if you dont whant to have nested functions then your gonna have to make it statefull
[13:33] txxt: could always only callback the initial callback once the readFile callback is done, i guess.
[13:33] mega`: and for that you shuld use a object
[13:34] txxt: mega`: do you know any example of that way to code ? 
[13:34] mega`: i can make some give me a sec

[13:50] mega`: i tried the function in the repl it dosent return anny thing
[13:50] txxt: in the repl ? 
[13:51] mega`: if you type node in the console you get a read eval print loop
[13:51] mega`: and you can try code
[13:51] txxt: why u say i am logging it in a async way ? i only trace to console.log when the callback is called. 
[13:51] txxt: mega`: ah thanks. didn't know that yet ;)
[13:53] mega`: yea but your returning before that so even if the console is logging the file size dosent mean that the function returned the file size
[13:53] txxt: mega`: ok, got it know, thanks for the explanation once more.
[13:54] Xeon06_ has joined the channel
[13:54] txxt: mega`: would you mind to show me a piece of code, like u said using an object, to avoid nested funtions and keep all async

[13:59] txxt: mega`: wow, nice example to hanle it that way!
[13:59] mega`: this is not how i whuld write it btw :D i like nesting away :D
[13:59] txxt: *handle
[13:59] txxt: mega`: yes, that would be my last question,  i guess 99% percent of the community likes and uses nested functions ? 
[14:00] Aria: Somewhat nested, not too deep.
[14:00] txxt: :P 
[14:00] mega`: rigth
[14:00] Aria: If you're going too deep, you're not making your own events and decoupling your code.
[14:00] cerisier has joined the channel
[14:01] txxt: if the levels start to get to deep, you start using objects has funtions returns to previous functions ? 
[14:01] txxt: Aria: ok good definition ;)
[14:01] mega`: you can always refractor nested functions
[14:02] txxt: meaning ? to another class file ?
[14:02] mega`: using function that return functions
[14:02] txxt: right
[14:02] mega`: theres no class files :D
[14:02] txxt: ups :| my bad

[14:04] mega`: no i think underscore has it
[14:04] mega`: but i havent used it in node
[14:04] mega`: http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/#flatten
[14:05] tuhoojabotti: I found a short snippet :P
[14:05] mega`: npm install underscore worked
[14:05] mega`: and the functions and a lott of other functions are in there

[14:13] pigmej: from many many usefull commandline modulse?
[14:13] pigmej: modules*
[14:13] pigmej: it seems hardcoded... 
[14:13] pigmej: like
[14:13] pigmej: sys.puts('> ' + (method + ' ' + path).grey);
[14:13] pigmej: sadly that gray == 'my terminal background'
[14:14] mega`: maybe you can overide what grey means :D
[14:14] Xeon06_ has joined the channel
[14:14] mega`: like updating the prototype of string or how thats implemented
[14:15] pigmej: mega`: in 'all' modules..
[14:15] pigmej: I wonder who invented that 'gray' thing
[14:15] pigmej: and other hardcoded colors
[14:16] pigmej: in eyes module I can remove those by using styles....
[14:16] pigmej: in ONE place
[14:17] mega`: if there all using the same method for colors then updating the prototype for string (if thats how the did it) shuld be enuf to overide all modules coloring
[14:17] pigmej: I seriously wonder who 'invented' it..
[14:18] pigmej: completelly useless thing
[14:18] pigmej: that SHOULD be optional
[14:18] pigmej: what with terminals that doesn't support colors ?
[14:18] pigmej: even worse problem there
[14:18] Aria: m
[14:19] Aria: Maybe not. Those terminals would ignore it.
[14:19] mega`: you can probebly turn of colors in your console
[14:19] Aria: But I'm with you on this: I often use light-background terminals. The people who use 'white' rather than 'normal' bug me to no end.
[14:19] pigmej: I can understand that colors for 'end user applications'
[14:20] pigmej: but well... why the hell a developer modules are using it ?
[14:20] pigmej: I don't see the point of it ;/

[15:00] Ramkumar: Local scraping works fine. Could be some issue with the socket connection pooling within node as it has 120 sec timeout setting?
[15:01] jetienne_: it isnt a matter of node
[15:01] jetienne_: this is a matter of network timing
[15:01] jetienne_: any language will show those timing. monitor your dns
[15:01] jetienne_: or the site you are scrapping
[15:01] pt_tr_ has joined the channel
[15:01] Ramkumar: we did decent number of tests to rule out the Server whose page we are scrapping
[15:02] Ramkumar: e,g, we accessed the site from the browser when Node had paused for 120 sec and it was all fine... we checked the logs etc
[15:03] jetienne_: a way to work around those timers would be to run many scrapper at the same time
[15:04] Ramkumar: yes, but 200 connections should be a breeze for Node... the machine is decent server class

[16:07] guidocalvano has joined the channel
[16:08] inimino: kadiks ⋱ It's because it happened on the first tick, i.e. not from a callback.
[16:09] kadiks: so I can't throw a basic exception ? O_o
[16:09] dguttman has joined the channel
[16:10] Xeon06_ has joined the channel
[16:10] inimino: kadiks ⋱ What?
[16:10] kadiks: do you mean it has to go in a try-catch ?
[16:11] inimino: You are throwing an exception, and you're getting a stack trace.
[16:12] inimino: I'm confused, what is it that you would expect to happen?
[16:13] kadiks: like a console.log I guess
[16:14] dnjaramba has joined the channel
[16:14] inimino: OK, that's not what exceptions are.
[16:14] kadiks: sorry I am just trying to do like real developers :-p. But I have no idea how to properly use that.
[16:14] inimino: If you want console.log, use console.log or sys.inspect or whatever it's called.
[16:14] kadiks: I thought it was stopping the script and give me the error
[16:14] inimino: Throwing an exception means that you've encountered an exceptional case and you need to halt.
[16:15] kadiks: yes, so I should "handle" this exception ?
[16:15] inimino: Logging means that you just want to see something on the console and continue to run.
[16:15] inimino: It doesn't sound like you should be throwing an exception at all.
[16:15] mbrevoort has joined the channel
[16:16] kadiks: in that case I don't have find the location of my config file, in this case I can't run my application at all, so I decided to throw an error which stops the script
[16:16] kadiks: this is not the kind of use for throwing exception ?
[16:17] inimino: That's a case where you should throw an exception.
[16:17] inimino: But in that case what you see is what you will get.
[16:18] inimino: If you want a friendly error message instead, then do something like "printFriendlyErrorMessageAboutConfigFile(); process.exit(2)"
[16:18] kadiks: but it seems like I have another error when thowing the error
[16:19] kadiks: if that the way it works, it's ok, it looks weird
[16:19] kadiks: thanks :-)

[17:08] ChrisAnn has left the channel
[17:12] deoxxa: b_erb: setTimeout in the callback would mean that the callback would be called every (time callback takes to run) + x ms

[18:13] tuhoojabotti: burg: It's a feature.
[18:13] JKarsrud: :D
[18:13] tuhoojabotti: Consider it a bonus!
[18:13] tuhoojabotti: Like Google +1
[18:13] tuhoojabotti: 11 +1
[18:13] pdonald: getYear method returns the year minus 1900
[18:15] bwinton: tuhoojabotti: 19100 FTW!  :)
[18:15] tuhoojabotti: Huh?
[18:16] JKarsrud: aight, never mind, I just had a .css file in there too, which overrode the less :)

[18:56] fille: partial('comment', { collection: comments });
[18:56] JKarsrud: yeah, I tried that, but it didn't find my partial
[18:56] JKarsrud: I even tried setting the 'partials' path
[18:57] saschagehlich has joined the channel
[18:57] euforic: JKarsrud: Where is the partial being called in a jade file or in app.js
[18:57] JKarsrud: in app.js
[18:57] JKarsrud: app.set('partials', __dirname + 'views/partials');
[18:58] JKarsrud: then in my route callback; res.partial('test');

[19:00] nitram_macair has joined the channel
[19:00] JKarsrud: yeah, that works
[19:00] JKarsrud: but it feels ugly
[19:01] euforic: So partials/somepartial 
[19:01] JKarsrud: yes, that work
[19:01] JKarsrud: worked, sorry
[19:01] JKarsrud: but I just feel that I shouldn't have to
[19:01] JKarsrud: if I render a partial, it should go into the folder I've set as partial, imo
[19:02] dtan: jkarsrud, should have to reference the partials/ folder?
[19:02] dtan: you can name the partials folder anything want
[19:02] dtan: the path to the partial is all relative to where that file lives
[19:02] JKarsrud: yeah, doesn't matter what it's called, as long as I can set an option for what my partial folder is 
[19:02] JKarsrud: imo
[19:03] boaz has joined the channel
[19:03] euforic: You could do an app set using the view directory root 
[19:03] JKarsrud: so not like this?  app.set('partials', __dirname + 'views/partials');  then?
[19:03] euforic: Instead of the app dir root maybe
[19:03] JKarsrud: ah, right
[19:03] euforic: Yeah try that
[19:03] JKarsrud: yeah, that doesn't work 
[19:04] euforic: No just partials no views
[19:04] JKarsrud: ah
[19:04] euforic: Sorry on my iPhone so typing sucks
[19:05] Jubb has joined the channel
[19:05] cjm has joined the channel
[19:05] euforic: Or send the partials path as a local var when rendering views
[19:06] JKarsrud: so, how do I read a config setting? 
[19:06] JKarsrud: never mind, it doesn't really matter at this point
[19:07] JKarsrud: I have more important things to do, like getting some user authentication :D
[19:08] JKarsrud: but first, a smoke! 
[19:08] cccaldas has joined the channel
[19:08] dtan: jkarsrud - whatever you name setting you can then do app.set('myVar')
[19:09] dtan: i think it's a little weird to use a setter for a getter
[19:09] JKarsrud: ah, so set reads AND writes, based on how many params? 
[19:09] dtan: right
[19:09] JKarsrud: *are passed in, sorry
[19:09] JKarsrud: weird
[19:09] dtan: ya
[19:09] sonnym has joined the channel
[19:09] JKarsrud: but app.get is taken, so :P
[19:09] dtan: true 
[19:09] dtan: ha
[19:09] dtan: what about getParam('param')
[19:09] JKarsrud: but still, kinda weird
[19:09] dtan: a little verbose
[19:09] JKarsrud: exactly
[19:09] dtan: but at least it's more clear
[19:10] JKarsrud: getSetting
[19:10] JKarsrud: getConfig
[19:10] JKarsrud: whatevs
[19:10] JKarsrud: anything is better than set() for a getter :D
[19:10] TooTallNate: dtan: tj doesn't like camel case :p
[19:10] Xeon06_ has joined the channel
[19:10] JKarsrud: getconfig then
[19:10] dtan: haha, ok getparam
[19:10] JKarsrud: :D
[19:10] dtan: hah
[19:10] TooTallNate: no those are ugly
[19:10] JKarsrud: so set is better?
[19:11] dtan: set is confusing 
[19:11] TooTallNate: it's more "jquery-y", for whatever that's worth
[19:11] JKarsrud: uhm, no?
[19:11] TooTallNate: I agree its confusing
[19:11] dtan: ya i kinda got that
[19:11] JKarsrud: it's not when the naming sucks
[19:11] JKarsrud: :P
[19:11] JKarsrud: imo
[19:11] dtan: jkarsrud, tootallnate is saying that using one method to set/get is jquery-ish
[19:11] JKarsrud: I know what he meant 
[19:11] TooTallNate: it's like .attr() for example
[19:11] dtan: oh ok
[19:11] JKarsrud: or prop! 
[19:11] JKarsrud: PROP it is
[19:11] JKarsrud: instead of set
[19:11] dtan: ya but those attr makes sense
[19:11] dtan: set is explict
[19:12] dtan: to a certain action at its face value
[19:12] shinuza has joined the channel

[21:05] TheEmpath: ya
[21:05] tbranyen: http://pastie.org/private/bahsqzh87sk762tqo7xddw how does that template engine partials syntax look?
[21:05] TheEmpath: allow node.js to be authoritative with data AND structure through the whole stack
[21:05] tbranyen: is it too confusing?
[21:05] tbranyen: or is it obvious
[21:06] JKarsrud: isn't that just stache?
[21:06] tbranyen: JKarsrud: mustache doesn't allow you to go back up a context
[21:06] JKarsrud: atleast syntax wise
[21:06] tbranyen: but yeah
[21:06] doubletap: I have worked toward that a couple times but what I found is that in practice the client models often have different requirements than the models used on the server.
[21:06] TheEmpath: i figured as much
[21:07] TheEmpath: all of the mongoose getter methods wouldn't work in the client and all graphic collisions wouldn't work on the server
[21:07] TheEmpath: but there is some serious venn diagram overlappage
[21:07] doubletap: quite a bit
[21:07] TheEmpath: ACTION ponders.
[21:07] JKarsrud: tbranyen: sure, it looks good
[21:07] doubletap: there is a framework i saw a while ago that ORM/ORD's the differences.
[21:07] triplem has joined the channel
[21:08] doubletap: so, you build a framework that abstracts and unifies.
[21:08] tbranyen: JKarsrud: not even sure if going up is important
[21:08] triplem: hi, i do have a noob question concerning reading and "parsing" a tar.gz file.
[21:08] tbranyen: like grabbing values from the base context
[21:08] JKarsrud: nah, I doubt it
[21:08] triplem: i have already installed tar, but this is not really working ;-(
[21:09] TheEmpath: unrelated: i get to update my nifty real-time socket server from node 0.3.0 to current :X
[21:09] TheEmpath: its been a while.. been going balls deep into writing a tile engine in html5
[21:09] tbranyen: JKarsrud: okay took that bit out
[21:09] triplem: any hints on how to do this easily with e.g. exec?
[21:10] JKarsrud: tbranyen: I've never, in any framework or language, had the need to do so, so
[21:10] tbranyen: JKarsrud: another thing i've been debating is elseif support
[21:10] TheEmpath: doubletap: yeah, an idea of horizontal inheritence (traits) comes to mind for this
[21:10] JKarsrud: the thing I like about mustache is that it's logic less
[21:10] tbranyen: i hate that
[21:10] tbranyen: which is why i'm making this
[21:10] tbranyen: heh
[21:10] JKarsrud: hehe
[21:10] tbranyen: same syntax for conditionals and looping is too confusing for me
[21:11] TheEmpath: having a model server side uses server traits.. when it goes client, it gets client traits... by default it gets shared traits
[21:11] TheEmpath: js is prototypical, so mixins are already there...
[21:11] tbranyen: js is prototypical?
[21:11] TheEmpath: oh yeah
[21:11] tbranyen: sweeet!
[21:11] bnoordhuis: triplem: what exactly do you want to do with tar?
[21:11] TheEmpath: anyone know of a scala wrapper for js lol?
[21:12] triplem: bhoordhuis: a list of the whole content of the  file and then access single files and parse those
[21:12] triplem: tar tvf and then accessing single files in the tar.
[21:12] JKarsrud: tbranyen: maybe, but I've found that I can just as easily do the conditionals on the server and pass in vars from that
[21:12] JKarsrud: so
[21:12] JKarsrud: I don't know
[21:12] JKarsrud: :)
[21:13] tbranyen: JKarsrud: well if you're getting something from a 3rd party api and it changes, you now need to change code and restart your server to handle that
[21:13] tbranyen: if you have a templating engine that can withstand those changes, you can just change a template
[21:14] tbranyen: also i think many companies have frontend people that can handle templates, but not code, so thats a bottleneck in development if they cannot normalize the data to conform to logic less template syntax
[21:14] tbranyen: i know it slows me down
[21:14] JKarsrud: well, I'm actually a frontend dev
[21:15] JKarsrud: what I like tho, is that with mustache, I can use the same templates in both front and backend
[21:15] tbranyen: JKarsrud: yeah thats the goal of this engine as well
[21:15] triplem: bnoordhuis: pretty much a js noob, so any help appreciated
[21:15] tbranyen: i looked into handlebars, but dear god that was a nightmare to try and get working in node
[21:15] tbranyen: https://gist.github.com/994418

[21:19] bnoordhuis: triplem: there are (at least) two tar modules for node
[21:20] indexzero has joined the channel

[21:21] bnoordhuis: triplem: if you want to do it yourself, you can use either exec or spawn
[21:21] triplem: then the exec seems the way to go, right?
[21:21] bnoordhuis: triplem: yep
[21:21] triplem: ah, okay, i will dig into this. most probably come back if i do have more questions
[21:21] triplem: thanks for the help, anyway.

But I don't want to install either on my system, I just want to use them with relative paths from inside a .js file I'll run using nodejs. My example is right here -> http://bit.ly/oNUI37 <-  . Basically I can't get jsdom to see that I have already loaded node-htmlparser and I get the error message in the comments of test.js
[21:52] jesusabdullah: spetrea: Give your project a package.json file, use npm to install these things inside your project folder. That's my suggestion!

[23:02] random123: the css file is only about 20 characters

[23:02] JKarsrud: yeah, and the JS is empty, amirite?
[23:03] random123: Yes
[23:03] jimmyrcom: with long polling, isn't it just dumping data to iframe. Wouldn't mobile devices run out of memory if it's really active sending a bunch of script tags?
[23:03] random123: Why would 28B make it take 200ms longer though?
[23:03] JKarsrud: yeah, then it's 3ms for the request, and then 200ms for the request + download of the contents, 
[23:03] random123: the text/html is 309B and is only 2ms
[23:04] random123: I just tested and empty the file makes is 3ms

[23:08] muk_mb has joined the channel

[23:08] JKarsrud: then I guess it's just something the web inspector does
[23:09] random123: I need to get it down to 3ms as well
[23:09] random123: Atleast 20ms or less
[23:09] random123: If I write the CSS and JS inline then it doesn't happen
[23:10] random123: It is noticably faster
[23:10] jesusabdullah: Why so fast?
[23:11] random123: 200ms vs 10ms
