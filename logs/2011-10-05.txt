[03:46] Aria: Any reason you need 0.5.x so far? It's the new API, and still been shifting a bit. Though people do need to get in there and work with 0.5.x, it's just now getting to that point.

[03:49] justmoon: aaronblohowiak, so just ignore that they don't support 0.5?
[03:49] Aria: Yeah, 0.5 is the unstable stuff. Not everyone has the resources to target a moving target.
[03:49] aaronblohowiak: justmoon: dont use 0.5, that is the unstable branch
[03:49] Aria: It's stabilizing, but not quite there yet.
[03:50] justmoon: so you think pgriess will update it once it becomes the stable release?

[04:43] Aphelion has joined the channel
[04:43] jedahan has joined the channel
[04:43] Aria: socket.io is for interfacing with all the various vageuly socket-like things you can do from a browser to a server.

[04:43] Aria: (all of which are message-streams, not bytestreams)
[04:43] dynacker: Thanks Skyec 
[04:43] doctorm: What's the dead simple way to write to a socket then?
[04:44] doctorm: Is it all through socket.connect?
[04:44] Stephen: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.12/api/net.html
[04:44] Aria: What Stephen said.
[04:44] Stephen: Or http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.5.8/api/net.html
[04:44] Aria: new socket / connect / write
[04:44] Stephen: If on 5

[04:45] Aria: Consumption?
[04:45] steffan has joined the channel

[04:59] Stephen: I suppose the main problem is that for some reason when using DNode in Firefox 7 it's falling back to xhr-multipart
[05:00] Stephen: When I know it supports websockets
[05:00] errordeveloper: ok, I wrote this script which read a json files and compares the enties with a given prototype

[05:04] cainus: doubt heroku has firewalled mongo from the app servers
[05:05] Aria: Right port and IP?
[05:05] cainus: yeah... they provide it at the commandline
[05:05] Aria: Hm. Don't suppose you can check the port manually in any way..
[05:06] cainus: yeah good question
[05:06] cainus: lemme look into that... thanks for the idea
[05:06] Aria: Of course.
[05:07] Zamarok_: Aria: ok, I have determined that it is calling channel.users because that's the only place users is referenced as a property.. but the channel isn't 'undefined' because I see my bot connecting from my main account :s
[05:07] Aria: How does that imply that channel isn't undefined?
[05:08] Zamarok_: Well it wouldn't be able to connect in the first place without a valid value in 'channel'. I suppose it could be buggy though

[05:11] Zamarok_: connect to the channel*, I see it in its channel for a second before it disconnects
[05:12] Aria: Yeah. That may not require having a working channel object in the code.
[05:12] Aria: (in fact, I bet it dies in the code that's setting one up post-join)
[05:13] Zamarok_: I was just thinking that.. googling how to create a persistent connection
[05:14] Aria: Heh. Wrong way to go about it, I bet. It's not that it's not trying to persist. It's that it's failing to.
[05:14] Aria: There's no magic "please disable bugs" mode ;-)

[05:30] tiglionabbit: oo, figured out the crypto library
[05:31] tiglionabbit: and if I use connect-form it saves the uploaded file to a temp file, but how do I read through it by chunks?
[05:31] Stephen: Ergh, damnit

[05:43] tiglionabbit: doctorm: I don't understand the question
[05:43] tiglionabbit: are you using socket.io or faye or something else?
[05:43] doctorm: tiglionabbit: And I don't understand sockets, so I'm probably asking it wrong. I'll try again
[05:43] DevX101 has joined the channel
[05:43] guillermo has joined the channel
[05:43] doctorm: Not for websockets
[05:43] tiglionabbit: oh whoops!
[05:44] doctorm: Just using base node
[05:44] tiglionabbit: tcp or http?
[05:44] doctorm: tcp I think.
[05:44] doctorm: net.createServer(function(socket) { socket.write("hello\r\n"); }).listen(8999, '127.0.0.1');
[05:45] doctorm: So I would like to be able to write to that socket from the same file I created it in (don't know of a better way to put that)
[05:45] doctorm: For example, watch a file and output it to that socket server
[05:46] doctorm: and then have another server in a different location listening to that socket
[05:46] tiglionabbit: how is that supposed to work?
[05:47] doctorm: Why wouldn't it?
[05:47] doctorm: I mean, that's what I'm trying for, obviously that code doesn't do it
[05:47] doctorm: That was just to show the type of server I'm making
[05:48] k1ttty has joined the channel
[05:48] tiglionabbit: are you trying to make an agent that watches a file, waits for incoming connections, and when that file changes, broadcasts it to the clients?
[05:48] tiglionabbit: or is it something else?
[05:48] doctorm: tiglionabbit: that description is close enough
[05:49] doctorm: tiglionabbit: The clients aren't web clients though
[05:49] Stephen: tiglionabbit: Socket.IO
[05:49] doctorm: tiglionabbit: They are other servers
[05:49] tiglionabbit: who is connecting to whom?
[05:49] doctorm: one node server is connecting to another node server
[05:50] tiglionabbit: the person who initiates the connection is called the client
[05:50] jackbean has joined the channel
[05:50] doctorm: Ok, I said "the clients aren't web clients though" just to clarify
[05:51] Stephen: Firefox keeps failing on WebSocket and reverting back to xhr-multipart
[05:51] doctorm: that I'm not working with a web sockets
[05:51] Stephen: which is driving me insane
[05:51] tiglionabbit: so lets see, you probably just want to create a socket that connects to the server, and when it is ready, start a process running tail, and pipe the output of tail into your response
[05:51] tiglionabbit: er your request
[05:52] tiglionabbit: whatever you call it
[05:52] doctorm: tiglionabbit: Oh, ok, so I basically need to create another server that will act as the client, and somehow auth it so it's the only one that can write? 
[05:53] tiglionabbit: what?
[05:53] tiglionabbit: just create one socket and have it write things
[05:53] tiglionabbit: or are you talking about the receiving end now?
[05:54] doctorm: tiglionabbit: No, I was talking about the writing things. I think I'm confused about what that first function that gets passed to net.createServer does
[05:54] bEEEviz has joined the channel
[05:54] doctorm: I understand you can socket.pipe, but doesn't that first function get called every time a connection is made?
[05:54] tiglionabbit: doctorm: if you are initiating a connection, you don't need a server.  You just need one socket
[05:54] tiglionabbit: a server is a thing that handles multiple sockets for incoming connections
[05:55] doctorm: ok, I'll stop calling it that
[05:56] tiglionabbit: hm, did they remove os.popen?
[05:56] doctorm: so is what I'm doing with net.createServer wrong?
[05:56] tiglionabbit: probably
[05:56] tiglionabbit: you are trying to connect to a server.  Just make a socket
[05:57] doctorm: I thought that was how you make a socket
[05:57] tiglionabbit: no.  Servers wait for incoming connections and create new sockets for each one
[05:58] Stephen: Ok, got the details
[05:58] melcher has joined the channel
[05:58] Stephen: I need a NodeJS library which handles websockets HyBi-10
[05:58] tiglionabbit: btw, to stream the data once your socket is connected, you could use http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.3.7/api/child_processes.html#child_process.spawn on "tail -f" and then pipe the output or something
[05:59] tiglionabbit: Stephen: idk what hybi-10 is.  I use socket.io or faye.
[05:59] EvRide has joined the channel
[06:00] doctorm: Well, more specifically I'm running a parser written in node that watches a file and fires events.

[06:00] doctorm: So it would be nice if I could write to the socket programatically

[06:00] tiglionabbit: here I'll write some sample code for you

[06:05] meso has joined the channel
[06:06] jakehow has joined the channel
[06:07] tiglionabbit: ugh how can they have such bad documentation
[06:08] tiglionabbit: there used to be a tcp example in the docs but it isn't there anymore
[06:08] detaos: tiglionabbit: there's a trivial tcp server example on the home page.
[06:09] tiglionabbit: detaos: yes but there is no example for the client
[06:09] tiglionabbit: which is why doctorm is so confused
[06:09] detaos: ah
[06:09] tiglionabbit: there is literally no way to figure out how to do what he wants from the docs.  It is not documented anymore
[06:09] tiglionabbit: and it's a very basic thing
[06:09] doctorm: well, one of the many reasons I'm confused, but yeah
[06:10] detaos: anybody know how to read POST data out of an http request?
[06:10] doctorm: I'm trying var writer = new net.Socket(); writer.connect(8999, '127.0.0.1'); after I created the socket server, but I'm getting connection refused
[06:11] detaos: have you verified that the server is running?
[06:11] Stephen: Note: There is a fork of Socket.IO which handles HyBi 10
[06:11] Stephen: https://github.com/einaros/socket.io
[06:12] Stephen: Seems to fix the problem
[06:12] tiglionabbit: doctorm: yeah that's the right track.  Make sure the server is running.  Also, socket = net.createConnection(8999) is a shortcut for those two lines
[06:12] tiglionabbit: hm
[06:12] doctorm: I've telnetted to it, but maybe it's not running by the time the socket tries to connect. I don't see any callback for when the server has been created though
[06:13] tiglionabbit: though it'd be nice if you could get the socket in the callback argument there
[06:13] detaos: doctorm: just have it console.log the attempted connection to verift that step.
[06:13] tiglionabbit: doctorm: there is a callback argument.  It should give you the socket as one of its parameters (I'd hope)
[06:13] tiglionabbit: doctorm: also I think it assumes localhost
[06:14] doctorm: tiglionabbit: The thing is, that first callback in net.createServer gets called every time you establish a connection
[06:14] doctorm: I specified 127.0.0.1
[06:14] tiglionabbit: doctorm:  you don't want it to be called when you establish a connection?  Are you going to establish a connection more than once?
[06:15] detaos: doctorm: you can use something like http://brandnewbox.co.uk/articles/details/a_print_r_equivalent_for_javascript/ in your callback to see what parameters the callback is getting passed.
[06:15] doctorm: tiglionabbit: Well I think I have to. The "writer" will be connecting locally, and then the "listener" will be connecting from another server.
[06:16] tiglionabbit: doctorm: what
[06:16] tiglionabbit: why not just have the writer connect directly to the listener?
[06:16] doctorm: tiglionabbit: I guess I could do that, but I'd rather have it the other way around for this particular use case.
[06:17] doctorm: tiglionabbit: The writer should run regardless of whether it's being listend to
[06:17] tiglionabbit: so the writer is the server and the listener is the client?
[06:17] doctorm: detaos: Thanks, that doesn't really help me in this use case
[06:17] tiglionabbit: who initiates the connection?
[06:18] detaos: ACTION wanders off to bed
[06:18] doctorm: tiglionabbit: Well, both the writer and the listener are clients
[06:18] tiglionabbit: ACTION sighs
[06:18] tiglionabbit: who calls who?
[06:19] doctorm: tiglionabbit: I think I'm on a different page here, sorry
[06:19] tiglionabbit: TCP (telecommunications protocol) is like a phone.  One person has to make the call and the other has to receive it
[06:19] doctorm: tiglionabbit: The way I'm trying it now is, we've got "server" which does net.createServer. Then we've got "writer" which does writer = new net.Socket();
[06:20] doctorm: That's on Box A
[06:20] tiglionabbit: so the writer calls the server
[06:20] doctorm: Yes
[06:20] tiglionabbit: man I'm tired.  You figure it out :P

[07:21] eddyb: ewj: https://github.com/eddyb/v8-gearbox
[07:21] eddyb: don't treat it as a complete/stable project
[07:22] doctorm: Why do you feel like you'll get thrown out? Seems like node can use more people like you
[07:22] ewj: have they shut you down before, though?  I don't think of node as a particularly hostile project to interact with, though I could be wrong...
[07:22] eddyb: it doesn't even compile now because I haven't added a way to disable specific modules from being included (and the other guy is working on an Elementary binding)
[07:23] eddyb: doctorm: I tend to have great ideas delivered in crappy packages
[07:23] madsleejensen has joined the channel
[07:24] eddyb: wow, the guy did a great job: https://github.com/eddyb/v8-gearbox/blob/master/src/modules/Elm.gear
[07:24] eddyb: look how small the helper code is
[07:24] doctorm: eddyb: See contributing as a chance to improve your packaging then. It's good to have great ideas, it's much more difficult to get them out there, implemented, and dealing with all the crap that entails.
[07:24] ivanfi has joined the channel

[07:27] doctorm: eddyb: I'm not the person to ask for that, I'm a web developer.
[07:27] doctorm: eddyb: And I don't know C
[07:27] eddyb: (C++ actually)
[07:27] eddyb: yeah, nevermind
[07:29] ablomen has joined the channel
[07:30] doctorm: eddyb: Try asking on the node developer list, they very well might be interested. Don't get discouraged just because the node users don't really know what that is
[07:30] eddyb: second or third time this year I'd have to use a mailing list and every time I get scared
[07:31] eddyb: that's why my headphone plug still doesn't work
[07:31] eddyb: I have something else on my TODO-whenever-you-can-care-for-it list, but I'll get around to that, eventually
[07:32] doctorm: mailing lists are clunky, but they're not scary. If you take the time to write up what it is your stuff does and why you think node should have it, people will read it. Worst they can say is "no".

[08:49] eddyb: basically, once you got the data with the length "length", you send it for processing and set the state to "waiting for length"
[08:49] eddyb: bubunator: use TCP
[08:49] eddyb: does exactly that
[08:49] TheJH: bubunator, with TCP, he gets it in the orger you send it in

[16:45] xorbit: Quick newbie question: how do I "touch" a file in node?  The fs module does not seem to provide this function.
[16:45] xerox: write a new Buffer() to it ?
[16:45] Aikar: you ask for its permission first
[16:46] gigawatt: Is it better to use Arrays for string building rather than strings?
[16:46] xerox: maybe if you write in append mode you can avoid that
[16:46] gigawatt: v8bot_, 
[16:46] TheJH: xorbit, maybe open it in append mode and close it as soon as you've opened it?
[16:46] gigawatt: v8: t
[16:46] v8bot_: gigawatt: ReferenceError: t is not defined
[16:46] Aikar: gigawatt: no probally not, due to roping
[16:47] TheJH: xorbit, http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/fs.html#fs.open

[16:47] pizthewiz has joined the channel
[16:48] Aikar: gigawatt: doing a string append does whats called "roping" where it doesnt actually rebuild the entire string, it sort of like linked lists them
[16:48] gigawatt: so they act like an array
[16:48] xorbit: TheJH Thanks I'll give that a try.  Seemed like one of these things for which a function would exist. :)

[16:49] Glenjamin: gigawatt: basically v8 is optimised for the string concat case

[17:02] xorbit: TheJH It works with Linux command line touch
[17:03] Cheery: baudehlo: what makes it so hard? You have address-to-mailbox mappings and mailboxes and you put mail from one address to one or more mailboxes, or forward it on different server.
[17:03] TheJH: xorbit, hmm, weird. no idea

[17:03] xorbit: hdon: node v0.4.9 on an old Ubuntu (Karmic I think)
[17:04] TheJH: xorbit, oh, rename is an idea. what happens when you rename it to its original name (no-op)?
[17:04] baudehlo: Cheery: well, you have to deal with global aliases, per-user aliases, tagged addresses, delivery methods (mbox, Maildir, etc), user account privileges... lots of issues.

[17:05] baudehlo: Cheery: you can do all of that in a queue plugin if you want to. Personally I just prefer to hand off to qmail-queue to do it for me.

[17:09] hdon: why can i not assign to the global variable "f" from my fs.open() callback?
[17:09] xorbit: TheJH: Rename to the same thing didn't work.  Rename to something else and back does work, but it is of course extremely hackish. :) I vote for adding touch to the fs module!

[17:50] Dreamer3 has joined the channel
[17:51] jesusabdullah: shanebo: Do you have a package.json one level down? I'd imagine that would make node look for modules at that level (ie, not what you want)
[17:51] Cheery: baudehlo: I figured how I might be doing it.
[17:51] shanebo: jesusabdullah, in my project?
[17:51] jesusabdullah: Yeah

[17:52] jesusabdullah: You should have a package.json somewhere right?
[17:52] baudehlo: Cheery: yeah... there's no plugin for IP based relaying (yet) though.
[17:53] Cheery: isn't that rather easy to do?
[17:53] baudehlo: I generally don't like the idea - I prefer authentication.
[17:53] shanebo: jesusabdullah I don't know should I? :)
[17:53] baudehlo: oh yeah piss easy.

[18:18] Stephen: Aikar: Nah, 7 has them enabled now
[18:19] Aikar: Stephen: cleared cookies? I know SIO use to cache the transport
[18:19] `3rdEden: it got removed in 0.7..

[19:01] TheJH: cviljo, just double-clicking does nothing
[19:02] TheJH: cviljo, you have to run it from inside cmd.exe

[19:31] Guest85324: luxigo : thanks 
[19:31] luxigo: too much recursive calls ?
[19:31] wereHamster: is it possible to install npm into a custom prefix?
[19:31] waseem: sure I get that, but how do I find out where the trouble starts
[19:32] wereHamster: or does it always go into process.installPrefix?
[19:32] luxigo: smells the infinite recursive loop
[19:32] waseem: yes but I don't know wether its my code, a library or something else causing it
[19:32] luxigo: waseem: maybe you should wrap the recursive call with process.nextTick()
[19:32] AvianFlu: waseem, how big is your code? how much are you requiring?
[19:33] AvianFlu: you need to find something that's doing too much recursion
[19:33] waseem: hmm so no magic trick available unfortuantly :-) let me try backing up pieces until I get rid of this issue. fyi, I am basically using node-imap to open 12000 imap connections concurrently
[19:34] AvianFlu: there's your recursion
[19:34] waseem: haha
[19:34] AvianFlu: you need to limit it
[19:34] waseem: really?
[19:34] AvianFlu: lower that number if it's just a tunable
[19:34] AvianFlu: if it's telling you too much recursion, try it lower and see
[19:35] AvianFlu: it could be a red herring, but I'm pretty sure that's what your problem is

[19:37] waseem_: sorry lost my connection there, so if I understand correctly you don't recommend node.js for opening 12K outbound connections?
[19:37] waseem_: I expect this to even increase towards 50-100K

[19:39] waseem_: @luxigo: makes since, but there should be about 65K available right? so how about 50K outbound connections per box?
[19:39] waseem_: since = sense
[19:39] mraleph1 has joined the channel
[19:39] chuck_daniel: waseem_: there's only so many ports available per IP address on a machine (65536 but probably way less reserved for euphemerial ports?) but if you were to use multiple IPs…
[19:39] TheJH: there are 60000*60000 possible connections *per remote machine*
[19:40] TheJH: and if you always connect to a certain port, 60000 connections *per remote machine*
[19:40] TheJH: so you can theoretically have millions of connectionjs to one TCP port on one machine
[19:40] waseem_: right, ok so my test set of 12K should be able to run
[19:40] wink_: waseem_: gist the code, you likely have a bug
[19:41] TheJH: did you already talk about ulimit?
[19:41] mfitz1 has left the channel
[19:41] TheJH: you hav to increase ulimit/remove it for many connections to work, right?

[19:42] baudehlo: Cheery: use connection.transaction.uuid

[19:42] waseem_: thats the code I am using
[19:43] waseem_: warning: node.js n00b at work :-)
[19:43] waseem_: the idea is basicly to have the connections idle until 'something' happens and then count the nr of unread messages

[20:37] djazz: ye
[20:37] mafiya: how would i create an array, then cycle through the array, and then start incrementing through it, like a, b, ... , aa, ab, ... aaa, aab
[20:38] wink_: unfortunately your problem has exited my ability to help :P.  fwiw, i believe node-waf is python, if you have a python runtime, you may be able to make it do
[20:39] djazz: i downloaded waf and ran in cygwin, seems to be same as node-waf
[20:39] djazz: (but not win32)
[20:40] djazz: i guess i'll have to make something js-only

[20:42] chilts: mafiya: just ask the question, don't ask to ask a question :)
[20:42] mafiya: chilts, i did :/ but no one responded
[20:42] Tobbe: tjholowaychuk: the dynamic helper is great! I added pretty = true to it as well :D I had that in every route previously....
[20:42] wink_: djazz: ah
[20:42] mafiya: chilts,   how would i create an array, then cycle through the array, and then start incrementing through it, like a, b, ... , aa, ab, ... aaa, aab
[20:42] wink_: you may try the mailing list?
[20:42] djazz: :P
[20:43] djazz: anyone know how the zlib module work?
[20:43] bingomanatee_: HardPhuck: you can put JavaScript in Mongo (or anywhere else) and "veal" it - however you couldn't give it its own namespace. You'd have to re-architect Node to do that. 
[20:43] Cheery: baudehlo: do you have proposed software for sending mail from localhost?
[20:43] Cheery: oh well.. I guess I'll look at smtp.
[20:44] bingomanatee_: You could read the mongo data into a text file, THEN apply it - but at that point what value would you be getting from putting it into mongo/database X?
[20:44] jocafa: num.toString(36) maybe?
[20:44] chilts: mafiya: var myarray = [ 'a', 'b', ... ]; myarray.forEach(function() { ... });
[20:44] chilts: not sure what you mean by 'start incrementing through it'
[20:44] HardPhuck: bingomanatee_: thanx. What about a module that is re-initialized if modified?
[20:44] HardPhuck: so I don't have to restart server if I modify some of the modules
[20:44] chilts: mafiya: http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_15.4.4.18
[20:44] bingomanatee_: Sounds like Jenkins + git is the solution you want
[20:45] HardPhuck: for example a simple module that deals with templates
[20:45] shinuza has joined the channel
[20:45] bingomanatee_: Jenkins can watch git and reset your app. 
[20:45] mafiya: chilts, thats basically what i was talking about, so that will do a, b, c, ..., aa, ab, ac, ..., aaa, aab, aac
[20:45] bingomanatee_: You could put ERB templates in a repo and read them USING Erb
[20:45] bingomanatee_: but that is not, per se, node - that is an application technique. 
[20:45] lux_ has joined the channel
[20:46] HardPhuck: hmm ok, thanx
[20:46] chilts: mafiya: yeah, presuming you have that in your array
[20:46] bingomanatee_: Also keep in mind that you may have open / working sessions if you are doing a web app - cauterizing those sessions when you change your code base is not great web app design. 
[20:46] chilts: are you creating the array with those values?
[20:46] MatthewS has joined the channel
[20:47] bingomanatee_: Unless your audience is prison inmates, like mine, and you don't care :D
[20:47] wink_: hah
[20:47] HardPhuck: :)
[20:47] mafiya: chilts, would i need to have a, b, c, .. aa, ab in my array, i know in perl you can increment it so that an array with a, b, c. can come with the output of aa, ab, ac ...
[20:48] HardPhuck: actually I'm working on a light cms thing (to learn node and js in general), and i want to be able to write link wraps dynamically, for example wrap every <a> tag with <li> and then output it
[20:49] HardPhuck: or rather put it into array

[22:10] astacy has joined the channel
[22:10] tjholowaychuk: what's the problem?
[22:10] shanebo: tjholowaychuk I'm using static middleware, which works great, but static paths that 404 fall through to my router
[22:10] tjholowaychuk: then they are not statics
[22:10] Cheery: how did I install with npm from a directory?
[22:11] tjholowaychuk: hence the 404 :p
[22:11] Tobbe: nodester, no.de or heroku?
[22:11] Cheery: oh. this way
[22:11] firebalrog: vps server
[22:12] shanebo: tjholowaychuk, well, if the file doesn't exist, isn't that a 404?
[22:12] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[22:12] tjholowaychuk: because it's not a file
[22:12] tjholowaychuk: so static() will next()
[22:13] shanebo: right, so in your connect router, do you ignore /public/* ?

[22:15] shanebo: tjholowaychuk  so after static, you have another middleware that ignores certain paths that would map to wherever your public directories are?
[22:16] tjholowaychuk: nope we just have
[22:16] tjholowaychuk: app.use(app.router);
[22:16] tjholowaychuk: app.use(express.static('public'));
[22:16] tjholowaychuk: so if the router doesn't handle it
[22:16] tjholowaychuk: static() can
[22:16] tjholowaychuk: if static() doesn't then connect will just default to 404
[22:17] shanebo: so then does your router next on static paths?
[22:17] TomY has joined the channel
[22:17] tjholowaychuk: nope
[22:17] tjholowaychuk: but if you dont have a route defined to handle

[22:17] tjholowaychuk: then internally yeah it'll next
[22:18] tjholowaychuk: but nothing explicit
[22:18] tjholowaychuk: there just isn't anything to handle those paths
[22:18] mynix has joined the channel
[22:19] shanebo: k, sounds like my issue is because we took a different routing approach

[22:20] tjholowaychuk: yeah

[22:20] Swizec_ has joined the channel
[22:20] LordMetroid has joined the channel

[22:24] dreamdust1 has left the channel

[22:25] shanebo: which is why it gets a bit tricky
[22:25] ryah: perezd: yes
[22:25] tjholowaychuk: shanebo oh, well yeah if you're not prefixing
[22:25] tjholowaychuk: then there's no such thing as a "static" pathname

[22:36] sechrist: hey tjholowaychuk, I'm using express-namespace and it seems like I can't use app.use() inside of any namespace
[22:36] sechrist: because it will apply to the parent namespace
[22:36] pandark_ has joined the channel
[22:36] sechrist: if I have them nested
[22:36] sechrist: is that expected?
[22:36] tjholowaychuk: sechrist yeah app.use() doesn't respect the namespacing stuff
[22:36] slickplaid: Is there really any purpose for not gracefully handling errors, instead just throwing them and letting the user of the module deal with them?

[22:38] tjholowaychuk: sechrist huh
[22:38] tjholowaychuk: no
[22:38] shanebo: catshirt, thanks. why use match?
[22:38] tjholowaychuk: it takes your app.get() etc calls
[22:38] LordMetroid: If I want to do some non-I/O part of my program non-blocking, I would have to initiate a new process, right?
[22:38] tjholowaychuk: and prefixes the namespace
[22:38] slickplaid: i like to throw errors on the ground
[22:38] sechrist: ah it's hacking the prototype
[22:38] Ned_: Anyone know if there's a verion of Express that'll run on Node 4.x ?
[22:38] slickplaid: because i'm not apart of their system
[22:38] tjholowaychuk: Ned_ yes
[22:38] Ned_: it seems the 2.x series required 5.x+ now ... :-(
[22:38] tjholowaychuk: Ned_ no
[22:38] MooGoo: LordMetroid: that or split your computation up using nextTick
[22:39] shanebo: catshirt  I'm needing a boolean, so test seems more fitting unless you did match for a particular reason?
[22:39] Ned_: tjholowaychuk: weird, I'm using npm to install it, and it's breaking 
[22:39] sechrist: all of this rant stuff on hacker news is kind of funny
[22:39] tjholowaychuk: Ned_: that's a bug right now i think, npm is being
[22:39] tjholowaychuk: retarded
[22:39] sechrist: event driven or not, you still have to know how to program
[22:39] catshirt: shanebo: i just used match so i could see the match output, you could use test
[22:39] Ned_: saying: npm ERR! Required: {"node":">= 0.5.0 < 0.7.0"}
[22:39] Ned_: tjholowaychuk: oh, really ?
[22:39] MooGoo: oh .7
[22:39] Ned_: :-(
[22:39] tjholowaychuk: Ned_ im looking into it right now
[22:39] catshirt: shanebo: but even though test returns boolean, you could still use match for truthy (since it returns null on no match)
[22:39] Ned_: tjholowaychuk: okay, thanks :-)

[22:41] chilts: mafiya: that seems a bit extreme, why do you need this?
[22:41] mafiya: chilts, doing a proof of concept on md5
[22:42] sechrist: tjholowaychuk: well I ran into that trying to apply a middleware to a namespace without adding it in every route declaration. is there another trick?
[22:42] mafiya: chilts, md5's already been cracked and can be done so quickly. but i want to see how fast node.js does it. So maybe even up to 8 would do

[22:42] brianc1 has joined the channel
[22:42] r04r: oh, in after
[22:43] sechrist: yeah md5 with no salt is ridiculously insecure
[22:43] mafiya: r04r, inb4 the 6gb rainbow table. has a 99.5% chance of cracking it
[22:43] sechrist: huge rainbow table farms
[22:43] sechrist: 6gb? hahahahaha
[22:43] sechrist: they use hadoop now
[22:43] slickplaid: md5 with salt is pretty insecure, too
[22:43] perezd: ryah: how does nodejs know when to yield to the event loop, other than explicitly via process.nextTick?
[22:44] slickplaid: if you are able to get access to the DB, there's a good chance you have the salt
[22:44] sechrist: ^
[22:44] slickplaid: bcrypt ftw
[22:44] jocafa: isn't node using libev under the hood?
[22:44] r04r: The salt means that rainbow tables will be ineffective
[22:44] chrislorenz has joined the channel
[22:44] slickplaid: r04r: until you have the salt
[22:44] sechrist: r04r: depends on the salt, and depends on if you hit a collision

[22:50] Ned_: tjholowaychuk: it seems that upgrading npm has fixed the issue :-)
[22:50] tjholowaychuk: Ned_ i just released a new one
[22:50] tjholowaychuk: npm considered 2.0.0alpha1 < 2.0.0
[22:50] tjholowaychuk: which makes sense .. kinda
[22:50] tjholowaychuk: really not ideal in this case haha but hey
[22:51] ryanmcgrath has joined the channel
[22:51] mafiya: sechrist, but id have to do something like j = 0; i = 0; i ++ md5(charArray[j],charArray[i])
[22:52] mafiya: then every so many iterations do j = j + 1?
[22:52] tylerstalder has joined the channel
[22:53] sechrist: well you need a string builder function
[22:53] sechrist: that takes in an index, and produces a string to your specification using the charset
[22:53] mafiya: i know that in perl, id just make the array, do array[0]+array[i] i++
[22:54] ryah: perezd: i dont understand your question
[22:54] perezd: ryah: so process.nextTick, thats an explicit way to tell node to yield to the next event in its loop, right?
