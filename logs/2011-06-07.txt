[00:00] swaj: how about some respect for what PHP did accomplish?  it saved us all from perl :P
[00:00] AAA_awright: Determinist: We've got a long way to go for that to happen... Wordpress is an unstoppable massive evil project that must be stopped
[00:00] zmbmartin: niftylettuce: ok nevermind thanks
[00:00] MooGoo: PHP is a prime example of "worse is better"
[00:00] jensn: swaj: So we went from bad to worse..?
[00:00] systemfault: MooGoo: I clearly agree with that.
[00:00] swaj: jensn: exactly!
[00:00] AAA_awright: But it's like stopping a freight train headed towards... what's the worst thing a freight train could be headed towards...
[00:00] Determinist: AAA_awright: wordpress makes me wanna kill something pretty. in fact, most of the big and successfull php projects out there are written so badly, it makes me angry.
[00:01] niftylettuce: AAA_awright: another freight train
[00:01] swaj: Determinist: Wordpress is actually a very, very nice piece of software.

[00:03] Determinist: yeah, it's a brand... it's well recognized
[00:03] swaj: I use MIT for all my stuff.
[00:03] AAA_awright: No, GPL isn't a horrible idea
[00:03] MooGoo: one day cheggit will be a brand
[00:04] swaj: I'm just against copyleft as a whole.
[00:04] AAA_awright: But Wordpress and Drupal somehow think that EVERYTHING that could POSSIBLY work with their software (I'm not joking) is automatically GPL
[00:04] Determinist: GPL is a pretty good idea. i do use MIT for my stuff tho.
[00:04] systemfault: AAA_awright: I hate that they sell it as being "freedom"
[00:04] systemfault: AAA_awright: When it's closer to slavery
[00:04] AAA_awright: And that that's "Freedom"
[00:04] AAA_awright: when haha, it's really slavery
[00:04] swaj: Copyleft is just as bad as copyright.  I'd rather MIT my stuff and let the consumer do what they want with it.

[00:40] bartmax has joined the channel
[00:40] chbrown: I see. Apparently both the string declaration inside the eval AND the eval itself need to be wrapped in ()'s.
[00:41] MooGoo: what's illegal in eval is just as illegal outside of it
[00:43] chbrown: Okay, what I _really_ wanted to do was this: var some_function = eval('function() { console.log("Hello mutherfucker.") }')
[00:44] chbrown: Oh, but it looks like this works: var some_function = eval('(function() { console.log("Hello mutherfucker.") })')
[00:44] MooGoo: that's what I said
[00:44] chbrown: Err, well, var some_function = eval('(function() { console.log("Hello motherfucker.") })')
[00:44] MooGoo: why would you want to do that
[00:45] chbrown: I'm pulling in "lambda" examples from the Mustache parser specification, and they involve code that, in the original yaml, is given as a string.

[00:46] DelvarWorld: would it work for you to use the Function constructor? as in 
[00:46] DelvarWorld: var func = new Function('param1', 'param2', 'console.log(param1, param2);'); func(1, 2);
[00:47] DelvarWorld: lets you programatically build a function, and I think generally considered less evil than eval
[00:47] MooGoo: it's the exact same as eval
[00:47] MooGoo: it's eval
[00:47] MooGoo: cept it doesnt execute the code right away
[00:48] chbrown: I'd rather do as little manual parsing of the given code as possible. Thanks, MooGoo, wrapping the eval'ed string with '(' and ')' makes it work. 
[00:48] MooGoo: and....it does not inherit scope
[00:48] jerrysv: or var some_function; eval('some_function = function() { console.log("hello!") }');
[00:48] DelvarWorld: you're a jerk moogoo
[00:48] MooGoo: I know but...why?
[00:48] jmoyers: not ineriting scope
[00:48] jmoyers: is importnat

[00:54] jmoyers: what the shit
[00:54] jmoyers: "the function body string passed to the Function constructor must be parsed every time it is evaluated."
[00:55] DelvarWorld: where are you reading that
[00:55] chbrown: As if it's going to change? That's ridiculous.
[00:55] jmoyers: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope
[00:55] jmoyers: i don't know about v8
[00:56] DelvarWorld: Therefore the Function constructor should be avoided whenever possible. HUH. I wonder if that's a mozilla specific implementation
[00:56] cafesofie has joined the channel
[00:56] jmoyers: given these are trivial examples

[00:57] jmoyers: on chrome 13
[00:57] DelvarWorld: what a terrible day
[00:57] tbranyen: new Function works really well in some cases
[00:58] jmoyers: which cases?
[00:58] jmoyers: i've seen it used in parsers
[00:58] tbranyen: templating
[00:58] jmoyers: quite a bit
[00:58] jmoyers: ^
[00:59] jmoyers: but why does it 'work really well' in that case, rather than using eval?
[00:59] jmoyers: i get the scoping issues, but aside from that
[00:59] sharkbone has joined the channel
[01:00] jmoyers: i saw it being used in jade, for instance
[01:00] tbranyen: scoping differences
[01:00] MooGoo: I've used new Function for performance critical code before and never seen a slowdown
[01:00] tbranyen: new Function and eval are not identical

[01:03] jmoyers: i dont have a bias
[01:03] tbranyen: i didn't say you did
[01:03] tbranyen: why infers a question :)
[01:04] jmoyers: so the answer then, is there is no reason, other than scope
[01:04] sharkbone: what is the best way to handle different client connection logic to the same server
[01:04] DelvarWorld: I try to scope at least 3 times daily
[01:04] tbranyen: jmoyers: afaik yeah

The truth of the matter is they are both using the same ip address identities and have a common station called the kiosk so this is where i nee

[03:47] aurojit: i'll try a bit more in a little
[03:50] davidbanham: aurojit: No big deal. It's just an info function so I know the server is up, I'll just use a callback on the listen method.

[09:26] framlin: Shinuza: yes, I want to use node
[09:26] Shinuza: then you'd either need to find a parser/lexer for javascript node that all so keep comments node around
[09:27] Shinuza: or modify uglifyjs
[09:27] Shinuza: or write your own
[09:27] framlin: but the concept, to transorm both JS-Code and UML to AST ant merge/sync/transform them, is working very well

[09:31] cryptix: why does expressjs need openssl support in node if i dont want to create a https server?
[09:33] samyak: found it !! tobi is doesn't set a content-type header by default ... and the express.js body parser wount work without it
[09:33] Twelve-60` has joined the channel

[09:50] samyak: skola, http://vilimpoc.org/blog/2011/01/19/testing-rest-api-with-learnboosts-tobi-vows-js/
[09:51] samyak: Skola, only thing is that one need to set the required headers as well, otherwise express.js will not recognize the req.body
[09:51] bnoordhuis: blueadept: couldn't this be an issue with gridfs?
[09:51] hide has joined the channel
[09:51] samyak: Skola, that has not been mentioned in the blogpost nor in the README of tobi
[09:52] bnoordhuis: blueadept: what happens if you pipe it to a real writestream object?
[09:52] blueadept: yes the possibility is gridfs as well
[09:52] Wizek_ has joined the channel
[09:52] blueadept: i'll try that next
[09:52] Skola: samyak maybe it's in express docs
[09:52] blueadept: this all happend after i upgraded node to 4.8
[09:52] blueadept: so it could very well be grid itself as well
[09:52] blueadept: or mon mongolian driver
[09:53] blueadept: mon*my
[09:53] samyak: Skola, yeah I found out that using http://groups.google.com/group/nodejs/browse_thread/thread/4d242c197ef5338f
[09:53] samyak: but defaulting at tobi level is what would I expect
[09:53] samyak: opened up an issue
[09:54] Skola: good yeah

[09:59] Stubbs: Hi all, I've got a problem starting nodejs
[09:59] Stubbs: https://gist.github.com/999180
[10:00] samyak: Skola, it can be also due to lack of documentation ... which is, well, expected at the start of a project ..
[10:00] samyak: funny thing is both of the project are from same authors :)
[10:00] Stubbs: It looks like the config isn't valid, but it looks Ok to me
[10:00] Stubbs: Anyone seen this before?
[10:00] samyak: Stubbs, is it config.json ?
[10:01] Skola: samyak, some people are pushing out node open-source stuff at a mad rate
[10:01] Skola: can't have it all (yet)
[10:02] samyak: Skola, if you are talking about tj i would say he has done a great job ... I can't complain if those things are not yet perfect for me !!!
[10:02] hellp has joined the channel
[10:03] Stubbs: samyak:  The file is called config.js
[10:04] Shinuza: Stubbs: this is not valid json
[10:04] bnoordhuis: Stubbs: the keys need to be quoted
[10:05] Stubbs: bnoordhuis:  Same error.
[10:06] bnoordhuis: Stubbs: have you updated the gist?
[10:08] Stubbs: bnoordhuis:  Not recently.
[10:08] samyak: you can check the well formedness  at the jslint.org/com

[10:13] Skola: or am I missing something
[10:14] Shinuza: the gist for the error isn't up to date
[10:14] Skola: cus if you JSONLint this:     "graphitePort": 2003,
[10:14] Skola:     graphiteHost: "localhost",
[10:14] Stubbs: no, I missed updating the error message ...
[10:14] Skola:     "port": 8125
