[08:26] seqastian: so anyone started a torrent client on top of node yet? ;)
[08:26] hipsterslapfight: funny you should say that, wasn't the official bittorrent/utorrent web interface just released as being built on node/express?
[08:27] seqastian: hm utorrent doesnt give out the interface though i think but runs it for all the users 
[08:28] seqastian: at least the version i last checked out 
[08:28] seqastian: doesnt sound like a good idea 
[08:28] hipsterslapfight: http://blog.bittorrent.com/2011/10/18/%C2%B5torrent-bt-mac-versions-go-stable-ipad-gets-remote-makeover/
[08:29] seqastian: i do like the idea they have to stream incomplete files over the webinterface 
[08:29] seqastian: but it doesnt really work yet i think

I normally use MySQL in my projects but this one requires a schemaless database so I have to go with a NoSQL one.  which database should I use? Which one has better best modules for node.js and easy to learn?

All my code does it takes a input buffer from Javascript and decodes it into local char* and  tries to convert it into buffer handle and sends back to JS

[17:47] Aikar: webjay: i dont understand what you mean, you do long I/O operations async cause they take long. non I/O ops do not need async because they dont block. .push() is not a blocking operation unless your doing millions of pushes in a single cycle
[17:47] Aikar: is that your usecase?

[17:50] jbpros has joined the channel
[17:50] Aikar: I dont know of any modules that do that for you, but it wouldnt be complicated to write
[17:51] wadey_: webjay: you could start with this: https://github.com/caolan/async#queue
[17:51] wadey_: and just make a helper to add delay before finishing the call
[17:51] bartt has joined the channel
[17:51] Aikar: call setInterval (easier than setTimeout) and array.shift() if array.length > 0
[17:51] webjay: wadey_: how?
[17:52] wadey_: record when you started, then setTimeout(next(), delay - (now - start))
[17:52] Aikar: that queue system doesnt look time/throttlebased

[17:54] NHQ: @webjay the function you pass to var q = async.queue() is the the one that operates on your tasks
[17:55] NHQ: q.push() is for sending new data to the task

[18:07] Aikar: jstash: actually due to the logic it still does work as expected... but yeah thats still bad
[18:07] jstash: ok, wasn't sure... just seemed fishy.
[18:07] Aikar: if you call force, it cancels timer, if you dont force, it doesnt check the value of .stop unless queue is empty anyways
[18:07] TheFuzzball has joined the channel
[18:07] jstash: ah, right.
[18:08] Aikar: actually yes it is broken, if you create queue and then dont register a function before the first tick, itll stop

[18:17] Aikar: err hold on
[18:18] Aikar: I made it execute first job immediately, but that opens up a door
[18:18] Aikar: of possibly executing faster than the threshhold
[18:19] Aikar: so now itll not hold process and .stop() is only for emergy abort
[18:19] Aikar: webjay: jstash

[18:42] tjholowaychuk: that's where the project started
[18:42] Aikar: is it a red icon, or a photo of me, or nothing?
[18:42] trose: so I have a page that is being dynamically updated by an express server and I want to have a download button to save a plain text version of the current page to the client's computer. Is there a way to do that while not losing the current page? Would I have to spawn a new window and write a content-disposition header to it? I'm worried about popup blockers ruining this idea

[18:48] danjx: trose, have you actually tried doing this yet? the browser will probably not leave the page when visiting a new url with a content-disposition

[21:25] jbpros has joined the channel
[21:25] `3rdEden: baudehlo they are actually going to work on improving it after redis cluster
[21:25] mjr_: baudehlo: redis uses disk in a non-durable way by default, and its the reason it is so fast.
[21:26] baudehlo: `3rdEden: good to know. This was a $work thing, where they changed the plan to use Riak instead.
[21:26] creationix|work: mjr_: is that also still true for mongo, or did they change that?
[21:26] mjr_: I dunno.  I guess mongo is getting better.  I've never actually used it though.
[21:26] baudehlo: creationix|work: couch (or mongo) would be too slow I think for bayes token storage.
[21:26] `3rdEden: creationix|work unless you use the save mode of fsync it would be basically the same
[21:27] mjr_: baudehlo: we use risk and redis together with quite pleasing results, but we desperately need redis cluster to complete the picture.
[21:27] baudehlo: if the average email is say 1000 words, and you're using a sliding window of 2 words, you'd be doing 2000 lookups.

[21:30] baudehlo: and if you want bayes, Haraka ships with a spamassassin plugin which has a bayes module.
[21:30] Cheery: I guess I'll use that
[21:30] creationix|work: actually, if it's ok do lose a hour or day's worth of data occasionaly, then it's easier
[21:30] creationix|work: just use redis and make nightly or hourly offsite backups

[22:01] domo: whats the fastest way to parse XML in node? I just tried xml2js from npm and holy hell it took too long
[22:02] isaacs: domo: why not just use sax-js directly?
[22:02] domo: idk, not familiar with these modules
[22:02] isaacs: domo: that's all that xml2js is doing, but it's building up an object, rather than giving you notification of each tag.
[22:02] isaacs: !npm search sax
[22:02] jhbot: package readabilitySAX: the readability script ported to a sax parser
[22:02] jhbot: package dom-js: XML DOM based on sax
[22:02] jhbot: package elementtree: XML Serialization and Parsing module based on Python's ElementTree.
[22:02] jhbot: package dom-js-ns: XML DOM based on sax
[22:02] jhbot: package sax: An evented streaming XML parser in JavaScript
[22:02] isaacs: !npm info sax
[22:02] isaacs: hm.... don't quite know how to use this bot...
[22:03] domo: so I can specify with tags I want
[22:03] domo: and continue on the ones I dont
[22:03] domo: its a pretty hefty xml doc.. but i only use 20 lines of it
[22:03] domo: so xml2js is probably the worst idea
[22:03] isaacs: domo: yeah, if you use xml2js for that, you're building up a much larger object than you need.
[22:04] mikeycgto has joined the channel
[22:04] mikeycgto has joined the channel
[22:04] isaacs: domo: with sax, you can even listen for one particular tag, and when you see that opentag, start watching for other things, then remove your listeners when you see the close
[22:04] isaacs: it's very low-level
[22:04] hipsterslapfight: i can't wait until xml is dead and json reins supreme
[22:04] domo: i had a webserver that would parse and return some text from the xml file and it took like 300 ms per request
[22:04] domo: did the same in php and it took 20 ms per request
[22:05] isaacs: domo: that sounds like something is very wrong with the first approach
[22:05] a_meteorite: What would be the best way to encode a timestamp? Sometimes when I readDoubleBE of an encoded Date.now, it comes out as a floating point value
[22:05] isaacs: also, php uses libxml2
[22:05] isaacs: which *is* pretty damn fast for many things.
[22:05] a_meteorite: Timestamp: 1.0605576599118097e-17
[22:05] a_meteorite: Timestamp: 1319234673454
[22:05] domo: so what is a valid comp for node?
[22:05] a_meteorite: Sometimes either one
[22:05] a_meteorite: (The second is intended behavior)
[22:05] domo: can I achieve those speeds using node?
[22:06] isaacs: sax-js cant' really keep up with libxml2 in a straight apples-to-apples shootout
[22:06] isaacs: domo: sure.
[22:06] domo: or is parsing XML with node not really cool
[22:06] domo: haha
[22:06] isaacs: sax-js does well by not doing nearly as much as libxml2
[22:06] isaacs: domo: it's fine :)
[22:06] isaacs: domo: if sax isn't fast enough, you can use the libxml2js binding, but it's, meh, compilation, etc.
[22:06] isaacs: bigger api
[22:06] domo: yeah
[22:06] a_meteorite: What's interesting is when it does come at as a floating point value it's *always* 1.0605576599118097e-17
[22:06] domo: if this damn api im working with returned in JSON
[22:07] isaacs: polotek does a good job maintaining it, but my feelings about libxml2js are based on my feelings about libxml2
[22:07] a_meteorite: When it comes out as intended, it's a millisecond posix time
[22:07] domo: so what do you recommend, implement sax-js and see the results of the parsing and response times
[22:07] isaacs: domo: that's how i'd approach it, yes.
[22:07] isaacs: domo: if sax can't do what you need, then let me know.
[22:07] creationix|work: a_meteorite: why store it as a double? can an integer not fit?
[22:07] isaacs: domo: and i'll see if it can be fixed :)
[22:08] herbySk has joined the channel
[22:08] domo: ok, i have two scripts side by side php and node and im just comparing who can be faster at handling the most requests on my box reading an XML file, parsing, and returning some data
[22:08] a_meteorite: creationix|work: iirc, it's more than 32-bits, but not quite 64
[22:08] domo: since I want speed, but not too much where ill go out of my way to write a server in C 
[22:08] domo: ;)
[22:08] creationix|work: a_meteorite: right, but js numbers are precise up to 53 bits

[22:16] creationix|work: the touchpad has way more power than the amazon fire

[22:32] [IL]aleminio: I have a chat based on ajax, the problem is, it consumes too much CPU resources. I'm thinking about converting it to socket.io but i'm afraid it will make it even worse to have so many users constantly conencted to the server.

[22:34] [IL]aleminio: i don't know if it's the amount of http requests, mysql queries or maybe both.
[22:35] russfrank: mysql queries?
[22:35] domo: isaacs: yeah, its def faster than 300 ms.. but php still murders it with libxml2
[22:35] domo: looking at 80 ms vs ~20
[22:35] domo: your xmllib vs php's C extension :p
[22:36] Cheery: baudehlo: I changed the rcpt hook a bit.. it now looks like this: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/bT5ZKXa4IqqN6audNFEz/
[22:36] tjholowaychuk: why dont you use libxmljs then?
[22:36] tjholowaychuk: that's not php being fast
[22:36] tjholowaychuk: that's php sucking with fast stuff on top
[22:36] domo: I never said that
[22:36] domo: someone obviously has a problem w/ php
[22:36] russfrank: i think he's aware of that ;p
[22:36] domo: lol
[22:36] domo: php still murders it with libxml2
[22:36] domo: i could of said X still murders it with libxml2
[22:36] Cheery: baudehlo: if I understood correctly, the relayed mail doesn't arrive to hook_queue
[22:37] domo: anyway, isaacs thanks for challenging me to test both results
[22:37] Cheery: baudehlo: should I do a hook_queue_outbound aside it?
[22:37] isaacs: domo: np, the fact that sax-js is within an oom of php+libxml2 is pretty encouraging.
[22:38] baudehlo: no, that's only if you want to do your own outbound stuff.
[22:38] domo: yeah, for sure man
[22:38] isaacs: domo: can you share the xml file yor'e using to test?
[22:38] domo: yeah
[22:38] isaacs: domo: also, you may want to have a look at libxmljs
[22:38] isaacs: domo: i'm guessing it's comparable to php's speed, since the bottleneck seems to be the xml parsing

[23:08] tjholowaychuk: vicapow you're probably using bodyParser

[23:09] vicapow: tjholowaychuk: well, i am using bodyParser
[23:09] vicapow: my actual code is a lot larger

[23:12] vicapow: tjholowaychuk: so i should only use bodyParser when I dont want to proxy the request? Is this only to avoid latency?

[23:32] TomY has joined the channel
[23:32] isaacs: amateescu: the issue is that you're using node 0.5, and connect only supports up to 0.4
[23:33] isaacs: amateescu: poke at tjholowaychuk 
[23:33] amateescu: isaacs: ah, that makes sense
[23:33] amateescu: isaacs: but there's no node.exe for 0.4, right?
[23:33] isaacs: amateescu: true.
[23:33] isaacs: amateescu: windows support is still pretty new.
[23:34] isaacs: amateescu: in the meantime, if you *must* have connect/express, you can use a virtualbox or vmware vm
[23:34] amateescu: isaacs: heh, kubuntu in vbox it is then, installing as we speak

[23:47] captain_morgan: isaacs: hey Isaac, sent you a pull request for the email I sent you earlier this week. I need me some multi-registry support
[23:48] isaacs: captain_morgan: hey
[23:48] isaacs: been meaning to reply to you, sorry
[23:48] captain_morgan: no worries, you're busy
[23:49] mikeal has joined the channel
[23:49] k1ttty has joined the channel
[23:49] MonsieurLu has joined the channel
[23:49] isaacs: captain_morgan: so, my thought on it was to have whitespace-separated registry urls, and then split them, and have separated configs for all of the specific registries.
[23:49] isaacs: captain_morgan: so, you'd have something like registry:http://registry.npmjs.org/:ca="npmCA cert..."
[23:49] isaacs: or you could set strict-ssl for each of them individually
[23:50] isaacs: the holdup is that *all* of the configs related to the registry need to be segregated this way, and read properly.
[23:50] captain_morgan: Are you intending to stick with ini for the config?
[23:51] captain_morgan: there is where I saw a blockade
[23:51] captain_morgan: at least to doing it simply
[23:51] isaacs: _auth (and also username/_password), ca, strict-ssl, ca, always-auth, bin-publish, proxy, https-proxy
[23:51] isaacs: captain_morgan: yes.
[23:51] isaacs: the config infrastructure should not change.
[23:52] isaacs: if you want to set a config for a given registry, you can do so using npm:registry:<regurl>:<field> = value
[23:52] isaacs: or some such
[23:52] isaacs: and then  var ca =  npm.config.get("registry:" + registry + ":ca") || npm.config.get("ca")
[23:52] isaacs: adduser's going to be tricky
[23:53] captain_morgan: so how would npm.config.get("registry") return?
[23:53] isaacs: also, figuring out the logic around handling 404's or 500s by going to another registyr.
[23:53] isaacs: captain_morgan: the space-separated list
[23:53] captain_morgan: ok
[23:53] isaacs: captain_morgan: and then any registry write operations would go to the first registry in the list.
[23:53] isaacs: captain_morgan: you can always npm publish --registry <blah blah> if you want to send it elsewhere
[23:53] mcluskydodallas has joined the channel
[23:54] captain_morgan: right
[23:55] isaacs: there's a lot of things we may *always* want to be registry-specific
[23:55] isaacs: like _username/_auth
[23:55] isaacs: so, adduser will always auth against the first registry in the list, and always write a config value like _npm:registry:auth or somthing
[23:55] isaacs: the _ is necessary to make it private.
[23:58] captain_morgan: so registry would remain simply a space seperated list, and addition values would be npm:registry:<url>:<field>
[23:58] isaacs: yeah
[23:58] captain_morgan: cool
[23:58] isaacs: in general, package-specific config fields are <pkgname>:<key>
[23:59] isaacs: so i think maybe it should be prefixed with npm: just in case someone ever writes a package named "registry" :)
[23:59] Vierstern has joined the channel
[23:59] meso has joined the channel
[23:59] captain_morgan: so the code I have will remain mostly the same, just need to add in field support, better error handling, and no fallbacks on write actions
[23:59] isaacs: yeah, you super duper do NOT want fallbacks from writes.
