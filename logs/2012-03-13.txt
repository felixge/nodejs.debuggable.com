[00:14] ningu: but
[00:14] _dave_h_d: this is surprising really 
[00:14] ningu: jsdom has something called contexify
[00:14] ningu: and that has C code
[00:14] _dave_h_d: because j query is very popular
[00:14] ningu: so I figure it's something with your compiler setup
[00:14] ningu: contextify*
[00:15] _dave_h_d: should i use jsdom
[00:15] ningu: I'm willing to bet the issue is with compiling contextify for jsdom

[00:31] isaacs: ningu: "latest" means "latest published"
[00:31] ningu: so if it isn't published, why would it be there?
[00:31] isaacs: ningu: you can change it explicitly by doing `npm tag pkgname@0.9.1 latest`
[00:31] ningu: ah, ok
[00:31] isaacs: ningu: i dunno, what thing is it?

[02:36] initohen: err, buf
[02:36] initohen: good question, one sec

[02:37] initohen: but console.log body only displays null
[02:37] kevinswiber: I just bit some Node.js trollbait on Twitter.  :/  Damn parrot virtual machine.
[02:37] initohen: or empty string, which i'm using 'cause it avoids a compile error

[02:38] Daegalus: like the other day, I was using ti to parse a binary file to convert its list of numbers from hex using UInt32
[02:38] initohen: (also first event can see body: buf used to be body)
[02:38] benvie: as an example
[02:38] initohen: body was a string, buf is a buffer

[02:40] Avanine: Daegalus: have you tried one of the flow control libraries out?
[02:40] initohen: just say node to coffeescript
[02:40] ningu: initohen: console.log() will never happen for the gzip/deflate case... but you're saying that one works?
[02:40] Avanine: like Sequence?
[02:40] Daegalus: Avanine: never heard of any of htem or thought to look for something like that, ill check it out
[02:40] kevinswiber: benvie: Weird thing is, I believe you.
[02:40] benvie: it'd be true if I had turbines
[02:40] Avanine: here are a bunch of good ones: https://github.com/coolaj86/futures
[02:40] initohen: ningu: when i put a console.log immediately following the body = data.toString(utf8) line, it echos the html
[02:40] initohen: it's like the switch has its own scope(?)
[02:40] ningu: benvie: what about turbans?

[02:42] ningu: that's where you're expecting it to be set, right?
[02:42] initohen: the gzip case does trigger
[02:42] Brandon_R: like is_int, is_string etc for each argument
[02:42] initohen: i'm expecting it to be set in gzip
[02:42] octayn: initohen: what if you run the thing through a real debugger and step through to see what's happening and where?
[02:42] Brandon_R: or trust the caller and hope they sanitize?
[02:42] initohen: and after the switch is exited, it's null
[02:43] ningu: initohen: oh, duh, just noticed the zlib call
[02:43] kevinswiber: instanceof someText == 'string'
[02:43] ningu: that's async

[02:43] ningu: there's your problem
[02:43] initohen: oh, really
[02:43] initohen: how would i take care of that?
[02:43] dtrejo: anyone know how to console.log without it adding a newline at the end?
[02:43] dtrejo: I would use sys.puts
[02:43] dtrejo: but that's old

[02:44] dtrejo: cool thanks
[02:44] initohen: also: how do i tell zlib is async from the docs?
[02:44] ningu: initohen: you could declare a function inline like function finish() { ... } and call it from the gzip callback

[02:44] initohen: oh, silly me
[02:44] conancat has joined the channel
[02:44] initohen: right
[02:44] Brandon_R: does putting a sync function in a nextTick anon function make it async?

[02:45] tmike: initohen: can you paste the JS you're fiddling with?
[02:45] joshfinnie has joined the channel
[02:45] initohen: well, that's a subtle distinction, i won't be hurt for missing it after a day and a half of node programming ;)
[02:45] ningu: initohen: anyway, the finish() can also be called from the default: even though it isn't async there
[02:45] initohen: http://pastebin.com/0itezPgy
[02:45] tmike: you've got to be careful with scope when it comes to callback
[02:45] sechrist: hmm I'm using ejs.render in node with a string template loaded from fsReadSync.. and the variables passed in the dictionary are coming up undefined when it tries to compile/render the template
[02:45] initohen: (coffeescript output)
[02:45] sechrist: weird
[02:46] initohen: tmike: indeed, i did consider it but i couldn't understand why it received the variable but couldn't set it
[02:46] Daegalus: Avanine: thanks, this will really help
[02:46] initohen: i mean, i did consider the structure as a difference
[02:46] ningu: initohen: in this case scope isn't your issue
[02:46] arturadib has joined the channel
[02:46] kevinswiber: Brandon_R: Err, I meant typeof, not instanceof.  https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof
[02:46] tmike: And what is the variable you're trying to access?
[02:46] ningu: initohen: body is in scope for all the relevant places, it just isn't set yet when you get to console.log()
[02:46] brianleroux has joined the channel
[02:46] initohen: gotcha
[02:47] initohen: (or when this part returns)
[02:47] octayn: Brandon_R: I assume that the arguments passed to me are valid and if they aren't and something bad happens, an exception will be generated or a testcase will fail, no big deal.
[02:47] octayn: It isn't the function's job to enforce its invariants, it's the caller's job.
[02:47] kevinswiber: Brandon_R: nextTick just defers the call, pushing it to the event loop queue.
[02:47] tmike: ningu's right.  Your function returns before the callbacks complete.
[02:48] octayn: Plus doing that removes all sorts of fun duck typing potential.
[02:48] initohen: what i really want is to block it, but i suppose i can't do that
[02:48] initohen: if i used it as a pipe it would work out though i think?
[02:48] Brandon_R: in erlang you just leave it to fail
[02:48] ningu: I don't think you can block on that
[02:48] initohen: since that wouldn't be using a callback
[02:48] Brandon_R: not sure if that's the thinking in node
[02:48] initohen: i just didn't understand the syntax enough, i was trying to step my way there :)
[02:48] ningu: there are some things you can block on, but I don't think that's one
[02:49] initohen: probably not
[02:49] ningu: if it's an external process you can block on it for example
[02:49] ningu: but this is within node
[02:49] initohen: but that's fine
[02:49] initohen: i learned something important about writing in node
[02:49] ningu: so it will just block, preventing the callback from ever completing
[02:49] initohen: i'm gonna call it a day and tackle this tomorrow fresh now that i have something to work from :)
[02:49] lohkey has joined the channel
[02:49] initohen: thank you guys for your help!
[02:49] ningu: the finish() rewrite is pretty easy
[02:49] ningu: you just put function finish() { ... } at the place of your console.log
[02:50] initohen: yeah, except if i did that ..
[02:50] initohen: the console.log was a debug function
[02:50] ningu: I know
[02:50] initohen: it's the function that this returns to two or three steps later
[02:50] initohen: that also receives blank data
[02:50] initohen: that i want to work :)
[02:50] kevinswiber: Brandon_R: Well, in Node, you don't really have a supervisor or anything unless you make one.  You need to recover from your failures somehow.
[02:50] initohen: the finish function won't block it
[02:50] ningu: it's a callback, it doesn't return to anywhere
[02:50] initohen: so really it's cleaner to use the pipes i think
[02:50] ningu: yeah, I don't know what you are trying to do
[02:50] initohen: er, i'm mixing my terms all up i'm sure, so i apologize
[02:51] initohen: i'm modifying zombie.js
[02:51] ningu: there are various ways of handling async control flow
[02:51] initohen: that code you saw is called in some other nested callback stuff
[02:51] thinkt4nk has joined the channel
[02:51] initohen: so it's trickier than i'd like to try and arrange it in a half-working way
[02:51] tmike: You don't really want to recover from failures.  You want to log as much stuff as you can and gtfo
[02:51] initohen: i'd rather have it stream the data
[02:51] justfielding has joined the channel
[02:51] initohen: but i'm not feeling up to tackling more new syntax after the last .. 13 hours or so haha
[02:52] ningu: well, good luck
[02:52] initohen: thank you sir
[02:52] initohen: i believe i can take it from here :)
[02:52] kevinswiber: tmike: Yeah, but you may want to restart your process.  That's something an Erlang supervisor can do, I believe.
[02:52] tmike: Given the pile of callbacks you end up under in node, you can't guarantee your state anywhere.  If an error gets thrown and you aren't absolutely sure the error is expected and acceptible to continue with, you're in trouble.  The program should die.
[02:52] tmike: Ah.
[02:52] tmike: Look at forever.
[02:52] tmike: It's a node module.
[02:53] justfielding: any suggestions for handling a single VPS with a few node.js apps, some sinatra apps and staticly hosted content? considering either using node as the proxy, or maybe looking in to HAProxy, but I'm a newb on all fronts there

[02:54] tmike: bed time for me

[02:55] sammmy: ACTION is being vague
[02:55] justfielding: Daegalus: thanks for the input, appreciate it =)
[02:56] kevinswiber: sammmy: What routing shizzle do you need to figure out?
[02:56] sammmy: I would like to use one server to host both my Node.js website and my PHP/Apache website. Depending on the domain of the requests, the system would route the request to the appropriete site. I would like to use Node as the routing.
[02:56] RobWC has joined the channel
[02:56] ningu: sammmy: is there a reason you can't use nginx for that?
[02:57] sammmy: ningu: I'm not familiar with nginx. Why wouldn't Node be good for the job? :\
[02:57] kevinswiber: sammmy: Node would be fine.  It's just a simple reverse proxy you're talking about.
[02:57] octayn: Why write code when it's already been done for you?
[02:57] ningu: I suspect nginx would be faster
[02:57] ningu: that too
[02:58] octayn: Not to mention by people who actually know what they're doing
[02:58] ningu: nginx is very easy to configure and there are plenty of tutorials online for the simple config for a node app
[02:58] tedsuo: yeah nginx is the best reverse proxy out there currently
[02:58] mansoor: except crappy websockets support
[02:58] jaigouk has joined the channel
[02:59] Lorentz: it's that http 1.0 vs 1.1 keep alive something something
[02:59] tedsuo: yep
[02:59] Lorentz: but otherwise it's good for you
[02:59] ningu: does nginx not support http 1.1 or something?
[02:59] kevinswiber: So it depends.  Do you need a bitchin' reverse proxy or are you just looking to get some Node.js experience by writing a simple reverse proxy?
[02:59] mansoor: I really want to use it and not hae to write my own static file server but the stupid thing has no support for WS.

[03:01] tedsuo: sammmy: https://github.com/substack/bouncy is an easy router if you want to go the node route
[03:02] tedsuo: also, you would not need an extra server, with either node or nginx
[03:02] sammmy: tedsuo: I mean an extra server technology like nginx
[03:02] kirbysayshi has joined the channel
[03:03] ningu: mansoor: what about this: http://www.letseehere.com/reverse-proxy-web-sockets
[03:03] tedsuo: gotcha 
[03:03] sammmy: But bouncy look pretty good. I suppose I could run my app with a specific port, and configure Apache to do the same (however I do that; not really any good with apache). Then bouncy would do all the work for me. :)
[03:04] sammmy: Wow. I love bouncy! Very good for what I need. All I need is a json file and this command line tool, and I'm set! No need for nginx. :)
[03:04] kevinswiber: sammy: It's pretty easy to configure Apache to listen on a different port.  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/bind.html
[03:04] onkis has joined the channel
[03:04] sammmy: Thanks tedsuo. ;)
[03:05] kevinswiber: Yeah, bouncy rocks the house in the ease-of-use department.
[03:05] sammmy: And it's pretty reliable?
[03:06] Brandon_R: hey guys i have another stupid question
[03:06] Brandon_R: how does putting nginx in front of node speed it up?
[03:06] dtrejo: anyone know of a module that takes some numbers and outputs an ascii bar graph to the command line?
[03:06] Brandon_R: if anything it should slow it down because the request has to go past one more wall, shouldn't it?
[03:06] kevinswiber: sammmy: Never used bouncy in a production env.  I'm sure SubStack has, though.
[03:06] brainss has joined the channel
[03:07] kevinswiber: Brandon_R: Depends how you're using nginx.
[03:07] MartinCleaver: in log4js, is there a way to automatically show the line number of the line that logged a message?
[03:07] Lorentz: Brandon_R: probably depends on what you're serving, something like straight up static files, can probably be served faster in nginx
[03:07] MartinCleaver: (and file, for that matter)
[03:07] kevinswiber: Brandon_R: If you're using it as a static file server, it's super fast.
[03:07] Lorentz: put varnish in front of nginx and it goes even faster
[03:08] MartinCleaver: I found http://code.google.com/p/aost/source/browse/trunk/tools/firefox-plugin/trump/chrome/content/logger.js?r=858

[15:20] ningu: ag4ve: in what data store?
[15:20] ag4ve: i know i can get .pre middleware to check something before writing, but i don't think that really ensures that nothing has happened to the record i want to write between reading some data (from middleware) and writing
[15:20] jtsnow has joined the channel
[15:20] ag4ve: eh, mongo... sorry
[15:20] ningu: mongo has various operations for atomic updates
[15:21] ningu: but I don't think it supports locking like that -- you probably want to use something else if that's what you need
[15:22] ningu: you might be able to do an operation that would amount to: update if not changed, otherwise throw an error
[15:22] ningu: for example, findAndModify
[15:22] ag4ve: well, really, i'm not sure that i do. other services seem to have gotten away without it. i guess i just need to figure out how messy non-atomic things can get
[15:22] rtgibbons has joined the channel
[15:23] ag4ve: right, that's what i was thinking with mongoose middleware
[15:23] ningu: ag4ve: actually, rather than findAndModify you probably just want to include all the former values in the first argument to update
[15:23] ningu: that way it will only update the doc if it's the same as it was

[16:22] ningu: for other projects, I mean
[16:22] isaacs: ningu: node is kind of a big project.
[16:22] ningu: isaacs: is there a roadmap up somewhere?
[16:23] isaacs: lot of hands, lot of platforms, etc.
[16:23] isaacs: ningu: the roadmap is this:  Stability.  Speed.  Debuggability.
[16:23] broofa has joined the channel
[16:23] isaacs: ningu: so, for v0.8, that means: all tests passing.  all benchmarks improved.  domains and customFd API finished.
[16:24] ningu: well, so far nothing has been slow or unstable for my needs, so I guess I don't need to pay attention :P
[16:24] orlandovftw has joined the channel
[16:24] jerrysv: isaacs: is there a timeframe for 0.8?
[16:25] bondar has joined the channel
[16:25] fred_____ has joined the channel
[16:25] isaacs: jerrysv: honestly, i think we're about a month or so out.  maybe less.  but there are some other distractions.  the new npm website is going to take a bunch of my time.
[16:25] ningu: to the extent anything has been buggy or inadequate it's all in modules
[16:26] isaacs: so, i'm thinking, early summer.
[16:26] isaacs: in time for nodeconf, probably :)
[16:26] ningu: isaacs: btw, the other day you mentioned joyent's data center uses a lot of node -- what does node do better that they felt the need to create it?
[16:26] jerrysv: isaacs: awesome. just trying to get a gauge on how quickly i need to make sure everything i maintain is up to snuff. thanks!
[16:27] ningu: I mean specifically for that task. since I don't run data centers I have no idea.
[16:27] _ritch has joined the channel
[16:27] isaacs: ningu: joyent didn't create node.  joyent adopted node.  ryah created node on his own.
[16:27] isaacs: jerrysv: we'll get v0.8 sooner if more people test on v0.7.
[16:27] ningu: while working for joyent, I thought?
[16:27] isaacs: jerrysv: and it'll be better.
[16:27] isaacs: ningu: nope, he joined joyent after node already had a bit of momentum
[16:27] ningu: ah, ok
[16:27] jerrysv: isaacs: fine, fine, i guess you've pressured me into it.
[16:28] isaacs: ningu: it sped up a LOT since then, though
[16:28] isaacs: jerrysv: :)
[16:28] jerrysv: isaacs: you almost got an emergency email from me while you were offline, but jasonsmith helped me through it :)
[16:28] isaacs: jerrysv: test, please: http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.7.6/node-v0.7.6-RC0.tar.gz
[16:28] dfletcher has joined the channel
[16:28] ningu: anyway, I have to assume it's the event driven, async model that attracted users like joyent
[16:28] ningu: but I have no idea
[16:28] mmalecki: I test master everyday :)
[16:29] jerrysv: mmalecki: no wonder you haven't looked at that vows issue yet!

[16:30] isao has joined the channel
[16:30] jerrysv: mmalecki: ha.  isaacs: will install on my dev vm after this meeting, thanks for the prodding
[16:30] _ritch: is there something special you have to do to pause a req's stream to get all data events after a tic or so? i seem to only get part of the data…
[16:31] isao1 has joined the channel
[16:31] madtimber has joined the channel
[16:31] isaacs: ningu: to answer your actual question, though: managing a datacenter involves a lot of IO, and a lot of systems.  node is good for large amounts of IO, and its apis make sense to experienced systems programmers who grok unix.

[16:33] mmalecki: also, it's epicly fun!
[16:33] ningu: isaacs: this is not a simple thing, but it's been a bit hard for me to understand the technical reasons *why* node is good at IO and other languages (python? ruby?) are not as good.
[16:33] ningu: or perhaps I should say other implementations, not languages.

[16:35] _ritch: ningu: ryan explains it pretty well in this video @ about 13mins http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAc0vQCC6UQ
[16:35] ningu: e.g. it's not clear to me why you couldn't give ruby with a similar api and achieve similar performance.
[16:35] ningu: _ritch: cool, will take a look
[16:35] jstewmon has joined the channel
[16:35] ningu: s/with//
[16:36] AndreasMadsen has joined the channel
[16:36] isaacs: ningu: so, with ruby (and python, et al) there's a culture of doing blocking IO
[16:36] ag4ve: yeah, i've had good experience with gearman for the clustered <environment of choice> system. haven't gotten my node up to a level i can comment on like that yet though
[16:36] isaacs: ningu: so, even if you use EventMachine or Twisted, you have to be very careful which libs you use.
[16:36] isaacs: ningu: with JS, there was no culture of ANY specific IO mechanism, because the language doesn't have one.
[16:37] isaacs: ningu: except the browser, which is already evented and async
[16:37] isaacs: ningu: 
[16:37] fangel has joined the channel
[16:37] ningu: isaacs: sure, but that's a cultural issue, not a technical issue.
[16:37] isaacs: ningu: also, most vm's are shit compared to v8 :)
[16:37] ningu: it's not like async i/o is a new concept.
[16:37] isaacs: ningu: no, but cultural issues are often best solved by forming a new culture :)
[16:37] isaacs: which is what node has done.
[16:38] ningu: yeah, I've gotten that impression (about v8) and I'm sure I can find articles on that.
[16:38] shanebo: hey guys in socket.io is there a way to only add people to a room if the request comes from a certain url?
[16:38] ningu: but none of the stuff node does is something I imagine couldn't be done in other scripting languages. that's why I was asking.
[16:39] springmeyer has joined the channel
[16:39] ningu: anyway, JS seems to lend itself well to the api.
[16:39] markq has joined the channel
[16:39] isaacs: ningu: yes, the culture of JS is one of asynchronous IO already.
[16:39] ningu: shanebo: that depends on when your code for adding people to rooms runs, doesn't it?
[16:39] shanebo: ningu yes
[16:39] isaacs: ningu: we are pushing it into new places.
[16:40] ningu: shanebo: if it's in an express route or something, you have access to the url...
[16:40] rlidwka: ningu: if someone can do the wrong think, he would eventually do it. Can you write blocking app in node? And what about ruby? So... :)
[16:40] rlidwka: *thing
[16:40] ningu: rlidwka: yeah, I guess I never thought about it that way.
[16:40] shanebo: ningu right but you don't have access to the socket at that point

[18:52] mertimor has joined the channel
[18:52] plato: I'm hoping someone can give me some ideas of what to do next. I just wrote this (regular JS) code to display a hex grid: http://jsfiddle.net/9YndA/

[18:53] overthemike has joined the channel
[18:53] plato: I have ruby code that I'll eventually call with node to get information about what to plot (i'll be plotting nyms and the trust relationships that link them eventually.)
[18:53] overthemike has left the channel
[18:53] mehlah has joined the channel
[18:54] plato: so on the client side I need to check stuff like mouseovers on each hex, clicks, keyboard input, then do stuff (possibly in ruby) server side, and tell the client what to put there

[18:55] rlidwka: plato: you have js on the client side and node on the server side. Where is a node then?
[18:55] hydrozen: @isaacs: hehe, yep that worked… but its like the second time this happens to me.
[18:55] plato: eventually, multiple clients will communicate their webs of trust
[18:55] hydrozen: @isaacs: seems to happen on every new npm release
[18:55] plato: so a person can run this to build his own maps of their trust network, or just share an interesting topography they built
[18:56] hydrozen: @isaacs: should I remove my .npm folder too just to be safe?

[19:05] isaacs: hydrozen: really?  whatever.
[19:05] isaacs: hydrozen: i mean, sure.  you can.  it's fine to.
[19:06] isaacs: hydrozen: npm *should* leave things user-owned in your home dir, even if you're running things as sudo.
[19:06] danroberts has joined the channel
[19:06] isaacs: hydrozen: it still creates a few dirs in the cache as root, which is an annoying little bug that i've yet to track down.
[19:07] hydrozen: @isaacs: so what's the difference between stuff that it puts into .npm in my home… and stuff that it puts in /usr/local/lib/node_modules for example?

[19:10] TooTallNate: which module?
[19:10] plato: danroberts: are you installing it from source
[19:10] danroberts: compress buffer
[19:10] danroberts: i'm installing from npm
[19:10] danroberts: 5.0.1
[19:10] TooTallNate: danroberts: actually, node has zlib built in as of 0.6.x
[19:10] TooTallNate: what do you need compress-buffer for?
[19:10] plato: have you installed stuff from source on windows? do you have a compiler that NPM can find?
[19:10] danroberts: log4js is trying to install it
[19:10] danroberts: and its failing

[19:13] skylamer`: ьаа
[19:13] TooTallNate: danroberts: gyp (the new build system) only supports MSVS
[19:13] skylamer`: just add in the path the mingw /bin dirercotry
[19:13] TooTallNate: danroberts: additionally, compress-buffer needs to be updated with a .gyp file instead of a wscript
[19:14] danroberts: doesn't MSVS come with the node windows package?
[19:14] plato: danroberts: you might try adding the package directory to your PATH environment variable. win+pause, advanced system settings, environment variables. its a semicolon separated list

[19:14] TooTallNate: danroberts: MSVS is like at least a 500mb download so no
[19:14] danroberts: oh i see, it's because compress-buffer isn't using a MSVS compatible script?
[19:14] danroberts: ah
[19:15] TooTallNate: danroberts: see https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp#readme
[19:15] danroberts: mmmk well if I download that will it build compress-buffer?
[19:15] kagoendios has left the channel
[19:15] TooTallNate: danroberts: not yet, compress-buffer needs a binding.gyp file first

[20:53] sx2020: so if I have 2000 clients, theoretically how fast could the timers be updating synchronously across clients assuming ~20pubs/second?  every second, tenth of second?
[20:54] sx2020: Let me rephrase that
[20:57] bkaney has joined the channel
[20:57] sx2020: I guess I'm confused about the rate capabilities of sockets.  So let's say 100 users each have one timer that displays to the millisecond, so "1:04.400" would be 1 minute 4.4 seconds. if I want 2000 clients to have a real-time dashboard displaying the total time elapsed on all 100 timers.
[20:58] TimTim` has joined the channel
[20:59] sx2020: How frequently could I send updates from the client to server and vice-versa?
[21:01] sx2020: 100 users would have new information one thousand times a second.. obviously you cannot push every one of these updates to the server.
[21:02] Axsuul has joined the channel
[21:03] onar has joined the channel
[21:03] jorenl_: sx2020: I'm not a pro, but I think you should just as frequent as your application needs. Updates every 0.001 second will probably not be relevant.
[21:03] Paul___ has joined the channel
[21:04] sx2020: So I set an interval of say 500ms for each client to "publish" an update?

[21:04] enmand has joined the channel
[21:04] jorenl_: sxs2020: it depends on your application. It might be more relevant to send event-based updates

[21:06] HardFu has joined the channel
[21:07] tmcw has joined the channel
[21:07] jorenl_: sx2020: if your application is something that changes continuously, like some games for example, you could send time based updates. If your client-side changes depend on user interaction (e.g, clicking some buttons, moving stuff around your screen, ...) it's probably better to send event-based updates to the server.

[21:13] rlidwka: level09: your system is probably working wrong. Could you make push to temporary directory (which is not watched) and then move it (it's atomary operation)?
[21:13] dreen has left the channel
[21:14] level09: rlidwka: I will need to watch the temp directory then
[21:14] level09: but I dont have control over the source software
[21:14] level09: what I get is big files, the size increments with time , until the file is completely transferred
[21:14] level09: I was thinking of watching the size / modifed date
[21:14] level09: but dont think it is a good solution
[21:15] rlidwka: no... client can just shut up a minute and resume then

[21:16] rlidwka: samba logs?
[21:16] level09: rlidwka: even if there are , they are on a different (windows) machine

[21:16] sandfox has joined the channel
[21:16] level09: never thoguht about that actually
[21:17] jorenl_: level09: the samba logs are on the machine hosting samba, so they could tell you about uploads.
[21:17] rlidwka: well... it's quite possible that samba reports successful upload
[21:17] tokumine has joined the channel
[21:17] level09: but then my code will be coupled with samba
[21:17] level09: imagine we use a different sharing method 
[21:17] nodokodo has joined the channel
[21:17] level09: it would be nicer to have watcher detect the operation regardless of the sharing method
[21:18] level09: but I will surely consider that solution
[21:18] Lorentz has joined the channel
[21:19] rlidwka: level09: you also can watch for creation date and attributes. 
[21:20] rlidwka: many servers set current time and mode 0600 for uploading process
[21:20] rlidwka: and change it after it's finished

[22:41] initohen: bugs are bugs after all :)

[22:57] sandfox: turn off the network on your client?
[22:57] initohen: clicknewk.exe!!!

[22:59] jorenl_: client side? if so I could just open an alert box and wait for some timeout to pass server side and see what happens

[23:06] initohen: i was just using it as an example. obviously if the connection breaks you can't get it back
[23:06] jorenl_: initohen: if that "profit???" was for me then, no, not for profit :)
[23:06] initohen: all you have to do is store some information that identifies it as the same user
[23:06] initohen: and .. use that to identify the user on reconnect
[23:06] initohen: i'm confused as to the difficulty here
[23:06] jorenl_: initohen: yes, that's what I'm doing :)

[23:07] dleary has joined the channel
[23:07] initohen: neither was the answer i gave, which was to utilize the disconnect mechanism in the socket.io client
[23:07] jorenl_: i'm indeed trying to emulate some error conditions.
[23:07] jorenl_: ok :D
[23:07] initohen: it has a timeout
[23:08] initohen: after the timeout expires it disconnects if no data has happened etc.
[23:08] initohen: just find what it calls and call that, it reconnects automatically
[23:08] jorenl_: rlidwka: currently, I added another 10 seconds timeout after the socket.IO disconnect event which is not reliable.

[23:09] Drevokocur has joined the channel
[23:09] jorenl_: rlidwka: apparently, socket.IO's automatic reconnects often happen before the disconnect event gets triggered server side
[23:09] jorenl_: so you end up having multiple session living concurrently for the same user and I personally find it rather challenging to deal with :)
[23:10] initohen: when someone connects and a session exists, disconnect the old one

[23:10] initohen: i was saying that to viven :)
[23:10] initohen: btw is it disconnecting frequently for you?
[23:10] rlidwka: It should not be challeging. You are supporting multiple connections (from different windows/tabs), dont you?
[23:10] teadict: tell me the flow control lib of your preference!
[23:11] initohen: i just ran down a bug in the latest version that causes that to happen
[23:11] teadict: node.flow?
[23:11] relix has joined the channel
[23:11] jorenl_: initohen: Sometimes it doesn't happen for hours, sometimes it happens after a while for me, some people seem to be having these disconnects ever 20 seconds or even less
[23:11] BrianE has joined the channel
[23:11] initohen: what version are you on
[23:11] jorenl_: rlidwka: I'm not supporting multiple  connections to the same "room" currently.
[23:12] initohen: when they added client side timeouts
[23:12] initohen: they defaulted the timeout to the same as the ping interval
[23:12] initohen: so they will indeed disconnect every <timeout> seconds
[23:12] rlidwka: users have a habit to have very bad inet connection yeah xD
[23:12] initohen: as the ping doesn't arrive by the time the client timer goes off
[23:12] initohen: you can set the client timeout to be longer than the ping interval to mitigate this :)
[23:12] initohen: ping = heartbeat
[23:12] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[23:13] jorenl_: hm.
[23:13] rlidwka: thats what socketio does
[23:13] jorenl_: I'm experiencing different sorts of connection trouble and I'm losing track of what is happening when sometimes
[23:13] rlidwka: his problem is: timeout happens when user is reconnected already xD
[23:14] initohen: yeah, i was just asking because it's definitely a bug in the most recent one
[23:14] jorenl_: I've even had the "disconnect" event happen when the currrent session on the server just keeps alive and working.
[23:14] initohen: huh, lol
[23:14] teadict: tell me the flow control lib of your preference! please!
[23:14] initohen: i like IF!
[23:14] teadict: NO U
[23:14] initohen: sometimes WHILE is useful as well
[23:14] initohen: maybe there is an IFWHILE library? :)
[23:15] mintbridge_ has joined the channel
[23:15] rlidwka: teadict: async (if that's what you mean)
[23:15] jorenl_: yeah, so the server detects a disconnect event, sends the clients in a room a message like "John Applepie has left.", and John Applepie receives this message too but he can just keep using the application.

[23:18] rlidwka: https://github.com/caolan/async - and this link you could find there :)
[23:18] jorenl_: rlidkwa: why were you asking about supporting concurrent sessions in different tabs? should I support them?
[23:19] teadict: rlidwka: thanks, I'll use that one
[23:19] c4milo has joined the channel
[23:19] rlidwka: jorenl_: i dont know your use case, but usually people wants to keep different tabs
[23:19] fomatin has joined the channel
[23:20] jorenl_: rlidwka: well, I don't think the want to in my case. every room plays music basically, and two rooms open at the same time doesn't quite sound nice :)
[23:20] bwen has joined the channel

[23:38] iangreenleaf: I just got massively shot in the foot by my require.extensions being overwritten by a sub-sub-module. Is this something other folks are aware of?
[23:38] sveisvei has joined the channel
[23:40] iangreenleaf: My app requires 'iced-coffee-script', which registers the .coffee and .iced extensions. But then I require 'zombie', which in turn requires 'coffee-script', and that seems to overwrite the .coffee registration for my own app.

[23:48] dthompso99 has left the channel
[23:50] initohen: from the namse of it, i'd think "iced coffee script" would fill the "coffee script" requirement too
[23:50] initohen: and from the website: "icedcoffeescript is a superset of coffeescript"
[23:51] initohen: also i'm not a fan of coffeescript but i sure like this await command :)
[23:51] Joeysomo has joined the channel
[23:52] jsurfer has joined the channel
[23:52] initohen: anyway, iced-coffee-script should be able to satisfy the requirement for zombie.js, maybe you can sweet talk it
[23:53] bingomanatee_ has joined the channel
[23:53] iangreenleaf: initohen: It certainly would, but zombie.js doesn't know about it (fair enough), and requires a coffeescript that's a local dependency for zombie.js (also fair enough)
[23:54] initohen: yeah, i don't know a lot about the dependency resolution, just sayin you can probably hack it to work
[23:54] iangreenleaf: The problem is that dependency of a dependency then gets ahold of my same global require object :(
[23:54] initohen: heh, i've been hacking on zombie myself recently
[23:54] phoneguysa has left the channel
[23:54] initohen: i'm a little confused actually
[23:54] initohen: it should be fine if coffee-script handles .coffee
[23:55] initohen: if what you need is "iced-coffee-script" shouldn't you require "iced"?
[23:55] initohen: from your statement it sounds like iced-coffee-script is registering itself as a handler for coffee-script, which seems correct
[23:55] limmy has joined the channel
[23:55] iangreenleaf: initohen: Well, I name my iced-coffee files .coffee too :) Usually that works fine, until this happened.
[23:55] initohen: but at the same time, if coffee-script registers itself as a handler for coffee script there's no issue
[23:55] iangreenleaf: So my .coffee files have await calls in em
[23:55] initohen: sounds like you named them wrong ;p
[23:56] initohen: a rename command will fix that yes?
[23:56] miccolis has joined the channel
[23:56] tmike has joined the channel
[23:56] iangreenleaf: initohen: Yeah, and that's probably what I'm gonna do for right now. Just wondering about an actual solution.
[23:56] initohen: i wonder if there's something about that provides this await syntax without the coffeescript stuff
[23:56] initohen: i guess i disagree that there is a problem
[23:56] initohen: the problem seems to be that you named your files wrong / required the wrong thing
[23:57] tmike: initohen: just see what the about statement compiles to?
[23:57] initohen: tmike: but then i'd have to write it that way ;)
[23:57] initohen: it probably compiles to a bunch of callbacks
[23:57] tmike: indeed
[23:57] iangreenleaf: initohen: Imagine if my project requires 'iced-coffee-script' instead - that would overwrite the .coffee extension in the other direction.
[23:57] tmike: I guess I don't mind the callbacks so much.
[23:58] sirPuppy31 has left the channel
[23:58] initohen: iangreenleaf: which would also be fine, because iced-coffee-script can supply interpretation for coffee-script
[23:58] initohen: tmike: i don't really either, but the other day i was writing a bunch of them and thought "hey, i wonder why they don't do this a better way"
[23:58] iangreenleaf: initohen: Actually, even better - imagine my module requires an outdated version of coffeescript. You require my project, and suddenly your new coffeescript features don't work.
[23:58] initohen: hehe
[23:59] initohen: if i require your project, i would be aware of your project's constraints and not disappointed if they got in my way
[23:59] initohen: tmike: i wrote a little scripting language in mirc a long time ago that let me do something similar and it was extremely useful
[23:59] tmike: fun
[23:59] iangreenleaf: initohen: Seems like a tall order. Remember, this can be if you require a module and *that* module requires my module.
