[00:47] oeginc: Has anyone developed a decent stable database abstraction layer for NodeJS yet?
[00:48] abjorn: Uhh, I made one for couchdb
[00:48] oeginc: I need one that is database agnostic
[00:48] abjorn: but that doesn't count, it's just HTTP requests lol
[00:48] oeginc: This project is starting out using MySQL, but I know I'm going to be migrating to Postgresql within the next year... I hate to have to rewrite everything
[00:49] konobi: Joose? maybe? perhaps?
[00:50] jerrysv: just released global.js -- it implements the "global pattern" for node.js
[00:51] jerrysv: available via npm "npm install global" or at https://github.com/JerrySievert/global
[00:51] jesusabdullah: what is the "global pattern"?
[00:51] jesusabdullah: It sounds bad
[00:51] jesusabdullah: but I will look!
[00:52] oeginc: Looks like shared memory for nodeJS apps
[00:52] jerrysv: it is AWESOME

[00:53] jerrysv: bnoordhuis: i saw mikeal's framework, figured there needed to be something that could work with the output
[00:53] jerrysv: thejh: as pure as the snow
[00:53] TheJH: jerrysv, yes, right
[00:53] jesusabdullah: what is this I don't even
[00:54] jerrysv: jesusabdullah: check out the test.js for more info
[00:54] jslatts has joined the channel
[00:54] jesusabdullah: Yeah, looking at it
[00:54] jerrysv: jesusabdullah: essentially, you can: var global = require('global'); - anywhere in any of your modules
[00:54] oeginc: So there is no database agnostic DAL for NodeJS yet from what I can tell... That kind of puts a kabosh on my plans.
[00:54] jesusabdullah: So why is /lib/global.js blank?
[00:54] jerrysv: and then whatever you set in that global namespace is available
[00:54] guybrush: 37bytes, sweet :D
[00:54] jesusabdullah: I feel like there's a joke I'm not getting
[00:55] jerrysv: jesusabduallah: because it works on exports -- you're just instantiating a shared "exports" from an empty module and using it
[00:55] jesusabdullah: o___o
[00:56] jesusabdullah: That works? :o
[00:56] jerrysv: and on that awesome note, i think i need to pack up and head home :)
[00:56] jerrysv: yeah
[00:56] jerrysv: and nobody else had released it
[00:56] guybrush: so what is the difference to ANY other package
[00:56] jerrysv: so ...
[00:56] guybrush: i mean
[00:56] jerrysv: guybrush: this one's only 37 bytes!

[04:47] Prometheus: sublim21: https://github.com/joyent/libuv
[04:47] Prometheus: sublim21: the exe is planned
[04:47] Prometheus: I'm not sure when that'll be, maybe tomorrow, but should be sooner rather than later I imagine
[04:48] sublim21: Prometheus: that would be great.  I can be your little test dummy :p

[04:49] Prometheus: sublim21: for the time being, I would just use a virtual machine =)
[04:50] Prometheus: *much* easier
[04:50] Prometheus: (well, relatively speaking anyway)

[04:50] Prometheus: sublim21: anyway, keep checking back from time to time, node.js evolves fast :)

[07:17] n2liquid: any ideas?
[07:18] febits has joined the channel
[07:18] Nuck: n2liquid: You prevent the click event from doing the default action (navigating) and change the address bar with a browser history update, then toss an AJAX'd in page for the final touch.
[07:19] n2liquid: Nuck: I guess the magical part happens with the browser history update, right?
[07:19] n2liquid: gonna check the APIs for that, thx a lot
[07:19] Nuck: n2liquid: As far as I know, yes.

[07:27] Nuck: dgathright_: I'm taking note of that too, I need to learn that shit lol
[07:28] dgathright_: n2liquid: Just trying to update that URL (document.location.href) will cause a new page load cycle

[07:28] Nuck: AAA_awright: I don't know, but this is awesome magic.
[07:29] dgathright: Nuck: It's pretty sweet.  some say pushState is the biggest thing for the web since ajax.
[07:29] Nuck: dgathright: Seems like AJAX done right to me.
[07:29] tuhoojabotti: Indeed
[07:29] dgathright: Nuck: Firefox 4+, Chrome, & Safari.
[07:29] tuhoojabotti: I use replaceState too :D
[07:30] tuhoojabotti: no ajax for those losers who don't support it.
[07:30] tuhoojabotti: dgathright: Latest opera has it
[07:30] Nuck: Is it added to Modernizr yet?
[07:30] tuhoojabotti: 11.11 I think.
[07:30] dgathright: Github's repo browsing pages have been using it for a few months
[07:30] tuhoojabotti: Nuck: Ages ago, it's Modernizr.history
[07:30] Nuck: tuhoojabotti: Oh fuck yeah
[07:30] tuhoojabotti: That's what I use :P
[07:31] Nuck: tuhoojabotti: I can fall back to hashtag URLs for those cases :D
[07:31] tuhoojabotti: Nuck: I won't
[07:31] Nuck: And then if all else fails, go to static.
[07:31] tuhoojabotti: I use hashes for css accordion :D

[07:36] [AD]Turbo has joined the channel
[07:36] AAA_awright: The semantic web community knows exactly why, the SWIG mailing list has some pretty devistating critiques of the practice
[07:36] dgathright: "... Ben Cherry pointed this out and expressed that it wasn’t really hashbangs that were the problem and that they were merely a temporary work around until we get pushState support."
[07:36] AAA_awright: But how hard is pushState
[07:37] dgathright: not hard
[07:37] AAA_awright: They have to check if the function exists and replace a few lines
[07:37] [AD]Turbo: hi there
[07:37] AAA_awright: They haven't done that yet?
[07:37] AAA_awright: You shouldn't use #! even if there's no pushState
[07:37] Nuck: I plan to
[07:37] Nuck: But I'll do that in JS
[07:38] tuhoojabotti: JS :O
[07:38] tuhoojabotti: omg
[07:38] tuhoojabotti: Why would you do that?
[07:38] Nuck: The links will actually be normal links
[07:38] tuhoojabotti: :D
[07:38] dgathright: Hah, it's almost like what is the point? They've already locked themselves into a lifetime of supporting client-side hashbang routing.
[07:38] AAA_awright: exactly dgathright
[07:38] tuhoojabotti: Nuck: My links are normal links, they just preventDefault
[07:38] AAA_awright: You can't serve an HTTP redirect
[07:38] AAA_awright: It breaks the web
[07:39] tuhoojabotti: The web is broken :D
[07:39] tuhoojabotti: dial with it
[07:39] tuhoojabotti: (the modem)
[07:39] Nuck: just /user/username and whatnot, but if they have JS, it'll try to pushState, but if that fails, it'll fallback to hashbangs.
[07:39] AAA_awright: I want to make it less broken
[07:39] tuhoojabotti: Nuck: Hashbangs don't work if the guy using the link doesn't got JS on.
[07:39] AAA_awright: I implemented a site with #! myself... I ditched it, I wouldn't do it again
[07:39] tuhoojabotti: Biggest problem with then.
[07:39] tuhoojabotti: them'
[07:40] Nuck: tuhoojabotti: Hence why that's in the JS and not in the anchor
[07:40] muhqu has joined the channel
[07:40] tuhoojabotti: Nuck: But, if the guy who gives the link to the guy has js on
[07:40] tuhoojabotti: and the guy who recevies it doesn't.
[07:40] Nuck: tuhoojabotti: Then hopefully he has pushState lol
[07:40] tuhoojabotti: That needs JS too...
[07:40] Nuck: otherwise, all I can say is "deal with it"
[07:40] tuhoojabotti: Yeah.
[07:41] tuhoojabotti: That's why I only use pushState.
[07:41] Nuck: tuhoojabotti: Aye, but pushState gives a regular URL
[07:41] Nuck: So I can fallback on static
[07:41] tuhoojabotti: I got tired of saying Deal with it to everyone :D
[07:41] Nuck: And if all else fails, fall back to hashbangs.
[07:41] jacobolus has joined the channel
[07:41] tuhoojabotti: Yeah.

[07:41] tuhoojabotti: "Please enable JavaScript, I beg you! You're missing out! I'll go away then. :3"
[07:42] tuhoojabotti: On the bottom left corner :D
[07:42] Nuck: To tell people without JS that if their URL has "#!", they're on the wrong page lol
[07:42] AAA_awright: Nuck: My RDF framework doesn't support # urls at all, even though technically RDF allows a hash-URI as a resource... It does support prefixes with a # and if you want to use a URI with a # you must use a prefix
[07:43] AAA_awright: Mostly, you can't render a page that was requested with a #
[07:43] Nuck: I'm debating how to do the AJAX shit.  I'm thinking I'll just use a simple function for the onclick property or something.
[07:44] ccare has joined the channel
[07:44] uchuff has joined the channel
[07:44] Nuck: How do you guys progressive-enhance the pushState stuff?  Do you use onclick attributes or click handlers?

[07:44] tuhoojabotti: No.
[07:44] tuhoojabotti: attributes can go to hell.
[07:44] tuhoojabotti: :D
[07:44] tuhoojabotti: $(link).clicl(); :D
[07:44] tuhoojabotti: click*
[07:44] dgathright: Nuck: My personal opinion is don't bother with hashbangs.  Use whatever is easiest if you can't support pushState, but don't worry about the supporting the actual "hashbang" protocol as proposed by Google, unless SEO is absolutely critical.
[07:45] Nuck: I'm thinking something like `ajaxThatShitIn('/url/to/api/call')`
[07:45] Nuck: dgathright: Hashbang protocol?
[07:45] tuhoojabotti: Nuck: It's a protocol you know.
[07:45] AAA_awright: Nuck: The great thing is with something like Jade or similar, you can render the page server side or client side... Is that how you're doing it?
[07:45] dgathright: Nuck: http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/10/proposal-for-making-ajax-crawlable.html
[07:45] Nuck: I was just talking about taking my pushState URLs and tacking #! in front of the directory
[07:46] AAA_awright: Send the HTML if you request a URI, or request the JSON for another page
[07:46] tuhoojabotti: _escaped_fragment_=hashbanghere
[07:46] AAA_awright: and render it client side and use .pushState
[07:46] tuhoojabotti: :P
[07:46] Nuck: AAA_awright: Actually, I'm using my own APIs.
[07:47] Nuck: It's not a small site, it's a big thing.
[07:47] AAA_awright: Nuck: You can use the same library to render server or client side, right?
[07:47] Nuck: AAA_awright: Nope
[07:47] AAA_awright: That's how I would do it, and expect it to be done, that's the very strength of Node.js
[07:47] Nuck: I don't use a template on the server-side, actually
[07:47] Nuck: I don't have server-rendered pages yet :P
[07:47] AAA_awright: Exactly the same way you would on the client?
[07:48] Nuck: Probably not
[07:48] AAA_awright: I can call the same function to render a page with Jade
[07:48] Nuck: I use DOM manipulation
[07:48] AAA_awright: Or you can use server-side DOM, too
[07:48] AAA_awright: That sounds better, actually
[07:48] Nuck: Unless tj makes Caustic work on the server, I don't expect to be using the same code on there
[07:48] Nuck: I'll probably just take my Static HTML design templates and reapply it
[07:48] Nuck: And build EJS off it

[07:50] Nuck: AAA_awright: Still not sure how to call on my APIs from a webserver.

[07:54] tuhoojabotti: debianart, wait what
[07:55] morgoth85: hi guys
[07:55] tuhoojabotti: morgoth85: Hello
[07:55] Nuck: AAA_awright: Then the web server will either hit up the API or access the DB directly (not sure which is better)
[07:55] Nuck: And then toss the results of the info lookup to EJS
[07:55] morgoth85: I want to read file by using: fs.readFile - I cannot pass file name with relative path - any clues how to do that?
[07:55] Nuck: Which then spits out a full page
[07:55] Nuck: With images loaded off the nginx
[07:55] tuhoojabotti: morgoth85: Why can't you? :u
[07:56] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[07:56] morgoth85: it doesn't work
[07:56] morgoth85: when I'm passing whole path (/home/path/to/my/file) - it's fine
[07:56] AAA_awright: Nuck: The API serves JSON data or similar?
[07:57] Nuck: AAA_awright: Aye, JSON
[07:57] tuhoojabotti: morgoth85: I remember that there was some issues with it.
[07:57] tuhoojabotti: But can't remember what :D
[07:57] tuhoojabotti: JSON<33
[07:57] morgoth85: relative paths doesn't work ;)
[07:57] tuhoojabotti: Yes, that was it!
[07:57] Nuck: It's a RESTful API that spits out JSON
[07:58] Nuck: They haven't fixed that yet?
[07:58] Nuck: Really?
[07:58] Nuck: Wow.
[07:58] AAA_awright: Nuck: So why can't the web server just emulate the web browser for the initial request, and render a complete HTML page
[07:58] Nuck: That's... Rather sad.
[07:58] Nuck: AAA_awright: Huh?
[07:59] Nuck: AAA_awright: I'm debating whether it'd be more efficient to call on the API or to contact the DB directly
[07:59] tuhoojabotti: morgoth85: What's your node version?
[07:59] morgoth85: 0.4.8
[07:59] morgoth85: 0.4.9
[07:59] tuhoojabotti: Update :P
[07:59] tuhoojabotti: Oh
[07:59] Nuck: lol
[07:59] tuhoojabotti: morgoth85: Try 0.5.0 or wait for 0.5.1? :D
[07:59] Nuck: 0.5.0 is out, AFAIK
[07:59] tuhoojabotti: Nuck: I know it is.
[07:59] morgoth85: yes, but it's marked as unstable
[07:59] morgoth85: I will try
[08:00] Nuck: morgoth85: All odd numbers are unstable, evens are stable.
[08:00] Nuck: That's the second digit, mind you
[08:00] AAA_awright: So here's how I see it working
[08:00] Nuck: the 0.x.0
[08:00] tuhoojabotti: morgoth85: It's just fancy talk, I've been using 0.5.0 preview from the beginning and it's been working fine :D
[08:00] AAA_awright: I think it would be a good idea to use the same code client side and server side... You have a view library that modifies the page, a DB layer that produces an object
[08:00] tuhoojabotti: I should update though.
[08:01] morgoth85: ok, I will look if this problem is still present in 0.5.0
[08:01] AAA_awright: The view library is loaded in the web browser, and used by the web server to render a static page upon demand
[08:01] Nuck: AAA_awright: The way I do development, I build a static example page
[08:01] Nuck: And then I lodge the dynamic bits within that
[08:01] Druide_ has joined the channel
[08:01] Nuck: For the server, not using DOM is probably better
[08:01] AAA_awright: Except, the web server uses the DB abstraction layer, whereas the client calls the API, which converts abstraction->JSON
[08:01] Nuck: And EJS is probably faster
[08:02] Nuck: AAA_awright: There isn't an abstraction layer, it's direct database access lol
[08:02] AAA_awright: Yeah wrong word
[08:02] AAA_awright: Database layer
[08:02] Nuck: The API and whatnot are coded to use Mongo-native
[08:03] jasonHulme has left the channel
[08:03] Nuck: AAA_awright: I'm debating how to handle that shit, honestly.  It's a pain to use a server-side DOm library, but client-side EJS is jsut sloppy.
[08:03] Nuck: And don't even get me STARTED on Jade/HAML
[08:04] AAA_awright: I think I have before
[08:04] Nuck: yeah, I hate them a lot :P
[08:04] AAA_awright: jade cleanly compiles to a DOM tree so I don't see the problem, personally
[08:04] AAA_awright: It's just a cleaner format of the same data
[08:04] baudehlo has joined the channel
[08:04] Nuck: AAA_awright: I disagree, I think it's a worse format
[08:05] AAA_awright: There's everything wrong with using whitespace in code
[08:05] AAA_awright: There's nothing wrong with giving whitespace meaning in data
[08:05] Nuck: It's not the whitespace
[08:05] Nuck: It's just retarded
[08:05] AAA_awright: It is for me. You like python at all?
[08:05] Nuck: abstraction layers, guys
[08:06] AAA_awright: Nuck: Jade does abstraction, you just can't see it right away
[08:06] Nuck: What was it that Ryan said in his explanation od Node.js?  Oh yeah, "Abstractions suck"
[08:06] Nuck: And I fucking agree.
[08:06] AAA_awright: Not like that
[08:06] Nuck: AAA_awright: I like to deal with my raw result.
[08:06] Nuck: I hate abstractions.
[08:06] Nuck: Because I think it's uneccessary.
[08:07] AAA_awright: But the thing is you aren't
[08:07] AAA_awright: You're dealing with DOM, not HTML
[08:07] navlelo has joined the channel
[08:07] AAA_awright: the HTML is just one format
[08:07] seivan has joined the channel
[08:07] AAA_awright: The DOM is the raw result
[08:07] Nuck: AAA_awright: Jade is a layer around HTML
[08:07] AAA_awright: Not exclusively
[08:07] Nuck: Which is a layer around DOM
[08:07] Nuck: So yes, it matters.
[08:07] AAA_awright: You can compile directly to DOM
[08:07] AAA_awright: Or to compressed XML
[08:08] Nuck: AAA_awright: Doesn't make it suck less.
[08:08] Nuck: It's a hideous ofrmat
[08:08] Nuck: It's like somebody decided to take my beloved HTML and smear feces all over it.
[08:08] Nuck: I don't approve.
[08:09] AAA_awright: I don't see it, really. You can still use plain old HTML, which is useful for formatting
[08:09] AAA_awright: and inline tags, <b> and whatnot</b>
[08:09] morgoth85: Realtive paths in 0.5.0 also doesn't work
[08:09] morgoth85: I will open an issue for this
[08:10] AAA_awright: (You have to break out the XML parser for it, but you do for Markdown and whatnot else Jade supports, too)
[08:10] Nuck: AAA_awright: It's just a shitty style.  I never liked any of those retarded HTML-raping things.
[08:10] Nuck: I've been working in HTML for almost half my life.
[08:10] AAA_awright: What's so special about HTML though?
[08:10] Nuck: I'm accustomed to it, for one.  And another is that it provides me with clear indication of a block.
[08:11] tuhoojabotti: :D
[08:11] Nuck: It LOOKS like a dom model and not an ASCII artwork
[08:11] tuhoojabotti: Clear flexible box model
[08:11] Nuck: Which you can't argue the same for Jade and HAML
[08:11] AAA_awright: JSON can carry the same data, http://www.w3.org/XML/EXI/ is another way to carry the data
[08:11] Nuck: AAA_awright: And it's just as retarded.
[08:12] Nuck: I never used jQuery templates, I never used Ruby, I never used Python.  And why?  Because they all didn't work for me.
[08:12] Nuck: They all look hideous.
[08:12] AAA_awright: Nuck: Jade looks like a tree, that doesn't imply, no, scream DOM to you?
[08:12] Nuck: jQuery templates are just silly.
[08:12] AAA_awright: I've stayed away from such jquery stuff
[08:12] Nuck: AAA_awright: Not at all, it looks like an aborted fetus got slapped onto a computer screen to me.
[08:13] AAA_awright: Uh huh
[08:13] Nuck: But no, it looks like ASCII art to me
[08:13] Nuck: Which just never worked for me.
[08:13] AAA_awright: In... what way?
[08:14] AAA_awright: Any objective critique? I'd like to know to see if there's some way I can adapt it
[08:14] AAA_awright: Isomorphism between data<->formatting is a deep interest
[08:15] Nuck: It looks like somebody decided to do an ASCII art data tree out of items, but instead of categorizing things by name or a logical and lax symbol scheme (such as in markdown), they decided to slap a random symbol for each item.
[08:15] Nuck: It also sorta reminds me of reading somebody else's pseudocode.

[08:18] hybsch has joined the channel
[08:19] Nuck: It looks good, but it's a bitch to hand-type and I wouldn't wanna hafta remember the formatting style.
[08:19] Nuck: Whereas with HTML, I can guess at the tags I don't know.  Like, do I need a section?  Thats <section>.
[08:20] k0ral has joined the channel
[08:20] Nuck: How about italics?  Oh right, <i> (well, not anymore, but it's still good for emphasis, since it's supposedly still legal in HTML, just deprecated)
[08:20] Nuck: As for regular block-level nodes, I've learned <div> works well
[08:20] Nuck: And for inlines, <span>
[08:20] Nuck: IT's really simple.
[08:20] Nuck: And I can not worry about formatting.
[08:20] Nuck: I just put the tags whereever the fuck I want

[08:22] AAA_awright: #id-of-my-dif Here comes some <b>bold</b> text
[08:22] tuhoojabotti: <strong>!!!
[08:22] AAA_awright: *div
[08:23] AAA_awright: But I don't necessirially want emphasis, and I'm lazy yo type out those 6 characters twice anyways
[08:23] AAA_awright: :p
[08:23] Nuck: AAA_awright: <strong> is bold.
[08:23] AAA_awright: tuhoojabotti: Yes you're right
[08:24] Nuck: I STILL don't see the big deal with <b> and such being so wevil
[08:24] Nuck: -w
[08:24] sriley: not really strong is strongly emphasised, it just so happens that its commonly rendered in bold
[08:24] dnjaramba has joined the channel
[08:24] tuhoojabotti: Yeah
[08:24] Nuck: It still seems silly to me that <b> and <i> and <u> are all so evil
[08:24] bergie has joined the channel
[08:24] tuhoojabotti: I'd emphasize strong with rainbow colors and underline.
[08:24] sriley: but you shouldnt rely on that fact, nor should you use strong over em for bold because of thats its default state you use it if you want more emphasis than emphasis
[08:24] Nuck: to me, they jsut seem logical.
[08:26] sriley: nuck to a non visual agent <b> <i> and <u> and all other presentational markup means nothing
[08:26] Nuck: fair enough
[08:26] Nuck: Same goes for any other HTML though
[08:26] sriley: html should be semantic and style goes in the css
[08:26] Nuck: Well, most HTML
[08:26] AAA_awright: It comes down that Jade does two things: It represents the DOM tree and blocks of my document in a very concise manner, and it adds Javascript expressions as part of the document
[08:26] wao: es
[08:26] Nuck: sriley: How is <em> not a style thing?
[08:26] AAA_awright: The first is why most users like it, the second reason I listed is why I use it
[08:26] sriley: cos it stands for emphasis
[08:27] AAA_awright: For of RDF javascript literals
[08:27] Nuck: AAA_awright: The first is why I hate it, the second is just sorta silly.
[08:27] AAA_awright: *For javascript literals in RDF
[08:27] Nuck: Since I can do the same in EJS
[08:27] AAA_awright: Not quite
[08:27] sriley: so in a spider that could imply add more weight to the text, to a screen reader might be read louder, for a visual renderer it might be render in bold
[08:28] Nuck: sriley: Meh, I guess that sorta makes sense :/
[08:28] AAA_awright: EJS would do #2 if I could do, for instance, <div title=((new Date).getTime()) />

[08:28] Nuck: AAA_awright: Not quite.
[08:29] sriley: however i do agree that ive never seen any point in jade, just makes maintenance etc a lot worse. eg try hiring a web developer that has even heard of jade
[08:29] AAA_awright: Noting that it's a javascript expression and not a quoted string literal
[08:29] sriley: same goes for that coffeescript abomination
[08:29] Nuck: I just do <div title="<%= Date.now() %>" />
[08:29] Nuck: AAA_awright: Done.
[08:29] AAA_awright: sriley: But that's nothing to do with design
[08:29] AAA_awright: Nuck: Which doesn't mean the same thing
[08:29] AAA_awright: It might output the same thing
[08:29] Nuck: Also, new Date.getTime is bad practice, AAA_awright.
[08:30] Nuck: AAA_awright: How not?
[08:30] AAA_awright: Nuck: What's the correct way
[08:30] Yoric has joined the channel
[08:30] Nuck: It's the exact same thing
[08:30] AAA_awright: Because it's inside a quoted literal
[08:30] Nuck: AAA_awright: Not sure, I just guessed Date.now()
[08:30] jomoho has joined the channel
[08:30] Nuck: AAA_awright: What the fuck is the difference?
[08:30] Nuck: Why does that matter?
[08:30] Nuck: IT's the same exact thing.
[08:30] AAA_awright: No, it outputs the same exact thing
[08:30] Nuck: It's just two ways of representing it.
[08:31] AAA_awright: Because that means different thing as a data model
[08:31] Nuck: I'd be willing to wager it parses damn near identically, AAA_awright.
[08:31] Nuck: AAA_awright: That's retarded.
[08:31] Nuck: Like, completely.

[08:31] Nuck: [AD]Turbo: FUCKING AWESOME
[08:31] AAA_awright: With <div title=(whatever)>, the value of the title attribute IS a Javascript expression
[08:32] AAA_awright: With EJS, it's setting the value of title to a string, of the result of the expression
[08:32] Nuck: [AD]Turbo: D: TRanslate it for meh.
[08:32] AAA_awright: If that makes any sense. With the former, I could typeof(someTag.getAttribute('title'))=="function"
[08:33] Nuck: AAA_awright: Um, once it's parsed to XML or HTML, it's not a JS expression.  Its the same as in EJS.
[08:33] Nuck: AAA_awright: So?  I don't do DOM manipulation on the server-side
[08:33] [AD]Turbo: Nuck, I've used Chrome ranslation
[08:33] Nuck: It's probably better :P
[08:33] AAA_awright: But I'm not conserned about evaluating it, I'm conserned about what it's carrying, uh
[08:33] AAA_awright: The variable in there might be undefined at runtime
[08:34] AAA_awright: I want to examine the unevaluated DOM tree
[08:34] AAA_awright: Before it's rendered
[08:34] AAA_awright: And use that to extract information... if that makes any sense
[08:35] AAA_awright: Nuck: What I'm doing is I'm using javascript expressions to compile a database query
[08:35] Nuck: AAA_awright: It doesn't it seems like a one in a million chance to hit that would only happen if you were TRYING to hit that problem.
[08:35] Nuck: AAA_awright: Then I jsut set a variable?
[08:35] Nuck: I don't need to use a DOM to store data
[08:35] Nuck: That's just silly
[08:36] eldios has joined the channel
[08:36] AAA_awright: I mean, what I'm doing is I don't want to have to pass any data to the template, the template should objectively identify the data it's consuming
[08:36] AAA_awright: And then a database, from that information, is generated, which the template uses whenever it's rendered
[08:36] Nuck: AAA_awright: I don't mind passing data to my template.
[08:36] AAA_awright: *database query
[08:36] Nuck: I pass it my database every time.
[08:37] Nuck: Because I keep a connection open
[08:37] Nuck: And queue shit onto that.
[08:37] Nuck: Okay, not so much "queue" as "chuck haphazardly"
[08:37] shadow_s: alright, since everyone seems a bit more active now, i'll ask my question again. is there any native way in paperjs to attach two items in such a way that one item is always attached to a certain segment of the other, but if one gets rotated, it doesn't rotate the other?

The content you display IS the data you used to render the page. Well, most of us don't use XML databases, how else are you supposed to get the original, unformatted data?
[09:05] blup has joined the channel

[11:03] Bwen: what... node.js does not have a templating system built-in... node.js is a server
[11:03] Evanlec: course I can combine them
[11:04] Evanlec: Bwen: yes, I am aware of that thank you

[11:05] Evanlec: but it is a nice templater

[12:40] mobius_: hi, i've created a small tcp server where clients can connect to and wait for events. I was now thinking of getting a cluster infront of my server to utilize the multiple cores. I however would like to have one array containing all clients connected to any node server instance. is this somehow possible?
[12:40] tuhoojabotti: mobius_: You just simply have to program it.
[12:42] mobius_: tuhoojabotti, hm, I don't think it's that simple. say 10 clients connect to instance 1 and 5 more on instance 2. each instance has an array containing only the clients connected to it, while I would like to be able to send events from a central point to clients nomatter where they are connected
[12:42] cjm: mobius_ I would use redis
[12:42] tuhoojabotti: Make the specs first
[12:43] mobius_: cjm: yeah ok redis is the first thing that came to mind. but what can you store in redis? a node-instance id and a client-id?
[12:43] unomi has joined the channel
[12:43] cjm: and then pub/sub channels if you need more resolution from there
[12:43] mobius_: so one could say go to node-instance 4 and send event to client-id 128?

[12:44] cjm: yea, there are some frameworks that do this right out of the gate, like socketstream
[12:44] bnoordhuis: tmedema: you'll need to implement write(), pause() and resume() methods
[12:44] tmedema: bnoordhuis: hmm, are these not implemented in Stream?

[15:01] tmedema: bnoordhuis: I know, the webserver has highest priority, thus it has lowest niceness

[15:21] pen has joined the channel
[15:22] keyvan: mscdex: im usually good at figuring out these things, but i truly don't know whats going on.... i started implementing my own gui system as a result--it's fun, but i think its probably better to use ncurses, so i wanted to use your extension
[15:23] mscdex: keyvan: hmm, what os and node version?
[15:23] keyvan: mscdex: Mac OS X 10.6.7 , node v0.5.0-pre
[15:23] mscdex: keyvan: and is it really a segmentation fault or is it another error?
[15:24] keyvan: a segfault for sure, but i'll reinstall/recompile and tell you in a minute. by the way this is the project i am doing that i want to use it for: https://github.com/keyvanfatehi/nim
[15:24] mscdex: ok, i haven't tested on 0.5.x yet
[15:24] keyvan: please please please can we get it working on 0.5.x ? XD
[15:25] keyvan: if its a javascripty thing, i can try to do it if you dont feel like it, if you give me some hints--i just dont know how to debug segfaults
[15:25] mscdex: i'm afraid to test with 0.5.x until i know everything is fully implemented
[15:25] keyvan: if it's a C++ thing, chances of me being able to do it are pretty slim but still possible as i do have good c/c++ experience
[15:25] mscdex: heh
[15:26] keyvan: oh i see it's still a WIP
[15:26] abraham has joined the channel
[15:26] mscdex: it should work fine on 0.4.x at least

[17:44] seb_m: if that helps
[17:44] addisonj: github docs are mostly the same as mongoosejs.com, but i have noticed a few changes that haven't been updated
[17:45] prannam: not to mention i couldn't find any examples of tdd for node.js ... there is jessie and jasmine-node .. but nothing seems to have any actual examples of controller specs

[18:21] stepheneb has joined the channel

[18:22] addisonj: is "const" valid in node.js? thought that was a firefox only thing...
[18:22] jerrysv: i saw the pull request. will probably need to wait until i get home, branch it, see if that trick still works.

[19:03] taf2: in my deploy.js ?
[19:03] yhager has joined the channel
[19:03] dingomanatee: yes
[19:03] dingomanatee: Push the deploy configs into rabbitMQ
[19:04] Skola has joined the channel
[19:04] dingomanatee: then have a message client that executes them and pushes them back into the queue if there is an error. 
[19:04] dingomanatee: That way you could route the same configurations to multiple executors on remote servers. 
[19:04] taf2: dingomanatee, got it so, use a worker to do the necessary steps to deploy code updates?
[19:04] dingomanatee: and take advantage of the routing architecture of rabbit. 
[19:05] taf2: ACTION is interested
[19:05] jarek has left the channel
[19:05] dingomanatee: Yeah - you could have several queues - one for EU, one for AU, one for US
[19:05] Prometheus: or if you are in to DIY, use Zeromq instead of rabbit ;)

[19:05] dingomanatee: push the configs into the queue, and have them sent out to the targets.

[19:06] taf2: this solves an issue where 2 devs would say at the same time push  a code update err deploy and update
[19:06] dingomanatee: Focus on the parts that need to be unique - the execution clients 
[19:06] dingomanatee: and don't reinvent the work queue which is failry stock. 
[19:06] dingomanatee: Every time an item is added to a queue you could have a listener go through and reconcile conflicts.

[19:25] fille: got a quik javascript question
[19:25] fille: is undefined like null?
[19:25] iMiksu: hi guys! does setTimeout() work for you guys?
[19:25] TheJH: fille, no
[19:25] TheJH: fille, undefined==null, but undefined!==null
[19:26] fille: undefined is a string?
[19:26] Marak has joined the channel
[19:26] iMiksu: i'm trying to write: setTimeout('console.log("test")', 1000) but it says "TypeError: Property '_onTimeout' of object #<Object> is not a function"
[19:26] Marak: tjholowaychuk: express supports nested form params like rails right?
[19:26] tjholowaychuk: Marak yup
[19:26] TheJH: fille, imagine that you ask someone for the way. null means "I don't know the way" and undefined means "huh? what do you want? and what is a way?"
[19:26] xerox: iMiksu: not '...' but function() {...}
[19:27] Marak: tjholowaychuk: do you have code in there that converts nested form params into JSON?
[19:27] tjholowaychuk: Marak: it's Connect's bodyParser actually.
[19:27] Marak: tjholowaychuk: im struggling to write that logic, well just having an anoonying time

[19:27] Marak: tjholowaychuk: thank you

[19:27] TheJH: fille, "if foo === undefined" (three equals signs)
[19:27] tjholowaychuk: i had it as querystring at first

[20:05] jtrally: adding it to to the body parser could be handy.  then you could view request.body.errors.  and send errors to the client right then and even use the same validators on the client
[20:07] caleb_: Can somebody take a quick look at this short gist and tell me why the callback isn't being, um, called?  https://gist.github.com/1083305  I was expecting setInternal to run every second and print to screen.
[20:07] brutus has joined the channel
[20:08] chjj: caleb_, why are you doing that?
[20:09] chjj: that will be an unstoppable timer started for every request
[20:10] caleb_: chjj: Just to prove that I can get setInternal to work.  The real goal is to have the node app call a JSON API every X minutes.

[20:11] robhawkes has joined the channel
[20:11] chjj: well, that looks like it should work

[20:17] Bonuspunkt: isnt crypto using openssl?
[20:17] Murvin: TheJH:  in 0.4.8.  it works.. but 0.4.9.. it cut off the decrypted string.
[20:18] chjj: are you outputting it as base64 when you encrypt it?
[20:18] caleb_: chjj: I have it working now.  I see why setInterval shouldn't be inside createServer. 
[20:18] Murvin: like... if I want to encrypt this: "1231321321313131313abcdefg"   a long string
[20:18] chjj: caleb_: hehe, yeah
[20:18] Murvin: then it will cut off 1232131313121232131abcde     
[20:18] Murvin: base64 doesn't work
[20:18] devaholic: why does everyone hate the node logo? i think this could be cool http://twitter.com/#!/tomblobaum/status/91596712388460544
[20:18] chjj: yeah base64 is bugged for ciphers output encoding
[20:18] Murvin: so, what I do is just encrypt to hex, and use New Buffer convert into base64
[20:18] chjj: theres a workaround though
[20:18] chjj: yeah
[20:19] Murvin: that's what I'm doing
[20:19] caleb_: chjj: Thanks for your help.
[20:19] Murvin: but the decryption cut off the string.
[20:19] chjj: or with Buffers that dont support hex strings, you can use binary
[20:19] Murvin: hmm hmm

[20:20] Stythys has joined the channel

[20:23] Murvin: the decrypted text is : 1234567890ab#)$*)(*$)#   weird character
[20:23] chjj: yeah thats what happens when its corrupted from the base64 bug, thats what youd expect to see i mean
[20:23] Murvin: for my encryption:,  i do encrypt.update(text, 'utf8', 'binary');

[20:24] chjj: and you concatenate it right?
[20:24] mendel__ has joined the channel
[20:24] Murvin: and then new Buffer(encryptedText1 + encryptedText2). toString('base64');

[20:24] chjj: do: new Buffer(text, 'binary').toString('base64')
[20:24] Murvin: ok
[20:25] chjj: you need to specify the input encoding for the buffer
[20:26] Murvin: then in the Buffer Decode

[20:28] dingomanatee: All the node libraries are 255RGB only
[20:28] Murvin: not my expertise.lol
[20:28] chjj: Murvin: just set the input encoding of the decipher to base64, deciphers arent bugged
[20:28] chjj: you dont need to throw it in a buffer
[20:28] brutus: hello, in a http server, is there a way to rewrite url ? for example change /my/path/test to /my/otherpath/test ?

[20:29] svenlito has joined the channel
[20:30] chjj: brutus: it depends on the context, whether youre using a framework, etc

[20:30] chjj: Murvin: yes

[20:31] brutus: chjj, i will try again

[20:34] pifantastic has joined the channel

[20:38] Murvin: so weird.. 
[20:38] brutus: chjj: it's really working, thanks for your help!
[20:38] taf2: isaacs, well, in my case i was decoding binary data... so i'm base64 encoding binary data then i'm encrypting it and in another process decrypting and decoding... 
[20:39] chjj: brutus: no problem

[20:59] seb_m: mscdex: i'm just curious. wondering if they have a tendency to drop
[20:59] TheJH: seb_m, why should it drop? if you keep-alive-ping every hour or so, it should stay open
[21:00] chjj: outputting a cipher as binary and then converting a binary string to base64 with a buffer should work
[21:00] mscdex: seb_m: as long as the tcp connection is still there, the websocket connection is still there

[21:01] clip: hi, is it possible to create a "url" leading to an ip adress, for the node server running in my local network?
[21:02] Murvin: chjj:  i have to encrypt the encrypt.update  and encrypt.final separately.
[21:02] taf2: isaacs, that would actually make a lot of sense!  i think you are right
[21:02] Murvin: let me do more testing..
[21:02] TheJH: clip, you have to open a port in your router
[21:03] TheJH: clip, then you can let others access your server using http://<your routers public ip>:<the port you opened in the router>/
[21:03] clip: TheJH: that shouldnt be a problem, can you give me a how to manage this? i just want to make "www.myurl.com" leading to the actual nodeserver
[21:03] taf2: isaacs, yeah. i think that's the issue
[21:03] taf2: s/i think //
[21:03] TheJH: clip: why do you want a domain name?
[21:04] clip: because the server should be easily reachable in the local network, and its not very comfortable to type an ip adress

[21:37] Tobbe: In a synchronous language when I see "int main() { a(); b(); c(); }" I know that it will first do "a", then "b" and then "c". In node I'd just see "a". Then I would have to read the entire "a" function to find that it calls "b", and then read entire "b" to find out that it calls "c".
[21:38] Tobbe: How do I get the same overview of a nodejs program as I do for my old synch programs?
[21:38] Skola: you can name your functions
[21:38] Tobbe: doesn't help
[21:38] hybsch has joined the channel

[21:39] chjj: you read it
[21:39] chjj: you dont just glance at it
[21:39] Tobbe: yeah I do. And then I read the code that I'm interested in right now
[21:40] Bwen: Tobbe: but I kind of understand what you are saying. The thing is you cannot code procedurally in node.js... its more event based cuz of its asynchronous nature
[21:40] n00dles: agreed, you'd still have to read all the procedural code - you just end up reading it all in a different order with functional
[21:40] n00dles: but i do catch your drift ;)

[22:02] Tobbe: Bwen: How does "Machine" know when "addDetergent" is done so that it can actually start?
[22:03] Tobbe: (I'm guessing "start" generates the pre-start event, and shouldn't actually start until pre-start is done)
[22:03] robhawkes has joined the channel
[22:03] Bwen: well you can either add another callback or have addDetergent method trigger an event on Machine.on('added-detergent', function(){});
[22:04] Bwen: Tobbe: and actualy I should of declared the "on()" before calling machine.start()
[22:04] Bwen: of course you have to inherit from EventEmitter
[22:04] Bwen: :P
[22:05] Tobbe: I understand how it would work with an "added-detergent" event
[22:05] Tobbe: but how would it look with another callback?
[22:05] Bwen: you pass the function as an argument
[22:05] Bwen: and within the addDetergent( callback) { you call it; at the end; callback(); }
[22:06] Bwen: it would then be this.addDetergent(function (arg){ done });

[23:46] devaholic: did you guys plan it? heh
[23:46] c4milo1: Nexxy: ++ 
[23:46] PeterPeterPeter: Hello
[23:46] devaholic: guess not
[23:46] isaacs: devaholic: i dunno.
[23:46] isaacs: devaholic: i didn't design it.  we hired somebody
[23:46] PeterPeterPeter: anyone want to check out my first nodejs project :)
[23:46] Nexxy: is it a chat app?
[23:46] PeterPeterPeter: yeah
[23:46] PeterPeterPeter: it is
[23:46] Nexxy: if so, I already have...
[23:47] Nexxy: 20 times
[23:47] PeterPeterPeter: well it's a bit different
[23:47] shanez has joined the channel
[23:47] PeterPeterPeter: it's non-anonymous
[23:47] devaholic: support the new logo a bit, even out all the hate
[23:47] jerrysv: if it's not a chat app, it's a framework
[23:47] tjholowaychuk has joined the channel
[23:47] Nexxy: a chat app framework framework!?
[23:48] Nexxy: count me in.
[23:48] devaholic: isaacs: ahh i see, well its far from bad, it's just not really hipster
[23:48] jerrysv: a chat app framework framework auto-builder
[23:48] Nexxy: jerrysv, but is it web scale?!
[23:48] PeterPeterPeter: it's a chat app that gets you inside the other person's minde
[23:48] PeterPeterPeter: mind
[23:48] PeterPeterPeter: you can then read minds
[23:48] digitaltoad has joined the channel
[23:48] isaacs: devaholic: it's actually pretty good at communicating what node is all about to people who aren't technical enough to read and understand the docs and code.
[23:48] jerrysv: nexxy: it can auto-build things that are web scale, so it's very meta
[23:48] PeterPeterPeter: it is a direct websocket connection to the person's mind
[23:49] Nexxy: PeterPeterPeter, I find that concept to be morally reprehensible
[23:49] Nexxy: please discontinue development and destroy any existing code base
[23:49] Nexxy: or the consequences will never be the same
[23:49] tjholowaychuk has joined the channel
[23:49] PeterPeterPeter: at least it is physically stimulating
[23:49] isaacs: devaholic: a logo for a tech project is a part of a way that we help execs be ok with their tech people using it.
[23:49] devaholic: isaacs: i liked it.  my only beef was simply that it was changed, but joyent/node.js is young enough that you guys can get away with it
[23:49] isaacs: devaholic: yeah
[23:49] PeterPeterPeter: Anyone want to give me their opinions about my app?
[23:50] isaacs: devaholic: now's the time.  and really, node.js *isn't* a cloud provider, so the previous one was a bit misleading
[23:50] Nexxy: yeah wtf now what am I going to do with my node.conf shirt!?
[23:50] isaacs: maybe it'll change again someday.  who knows.
[23:50] isaacs: Nexxy: it's a collectors' item now!  it's retro!
[23:50] jerrysv: nexxy: keep wearing it, it'll be retro
[23:50] Nexxy: ;o
[23:50] jerrysv: ugh, thanks isaacs
[23:50] Nexxy: ACTION runs to the closet
[23:50] chapel: lol
[23:50] PeterPeterPeter: i guess not
[23:50] Nexxy: I WAS USING NODE BEFORE THEY CHANGED THEIR LOGO
[23:50] chapel: now you are pre-hex-node
[23:50] Nexxy: ACTION plastic frame glasses
[23:50] chapel: yep
[23:50] jerrysv: ACTION almost wore his today
[23:51] isaacs: dude, i've got a node[cloud]js button on my bag.
[23:51] devaholic: i think it'd be in the best interest of node.js to just settle on one :P
[23:51] isaacs: super retro original

[23:51] Nexxy: isaacs, but was your bag sourced from sustainable materials and manufactured locally?
[23:51] Nexxy: *that's* the important question
[23:51] isaacs: Nexxy: probably not
[23:51] isaacs: Nexxy: it was $20 from GAP
[23:51] devaholic: there you go, anyone with merch that has the old logo on it can now use it as klout
[23:51] Nexxy: LOL
[23:52] isaacs: (speaking of changing logos)
[23:52] Nexxy: well
[23:52] Nexxy: damnit
[23:52] Nexxy: you stole my line ;<
[23:52] Nexxy: we can see how well that worked out for them ;o
[23:53] jerrysv: old node logo from the gap?
[23:54] Nexxy: something about minding the gap?
[23:54] aguynamedben has joined the channel
[23:55] jerrysv: on a completely different note, anyone know when/if batman.js is getting released?
[23:55] devaholic: probably got it stitched on, jerrysv
[23:56] jerrysv: wonder if the threads were local and sustainable
[23:56] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: how do you detect whether you're in developmnet or production?
[23:56] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: is there a req.app.env or something?
[23:56] tjholowaychuk: NODE_ENV
[23:56] digiwano: jerrysv: lol is it still not up

[23:58] devaholic: tj: whats the best way to *put* your app in dev/production?

[23:58] PragCypher has joined the channel
[23:58] tjholowaychuk: devaholic: NODE_ENV
[23:58] tjholowaychuk: :p
[23:58] mikeal: why does the Agent emit "continue" and "upgrade"?
[23:58] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: hm.  i'd like to add some stuff to output debug info in certain cases, but it's a lot easier to just test whether it's in dev or prod
[23:58] devaholic: so i have to grab args myself? sadface
[23:58] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: what's hard about app.enable('verbose logging')
[23:58] tjholowaychuk: etc
[23:59] tjholowaychuk: it's bad practice to check it directly
[23:59] isaacs: what's app.enable do?
[23:59] ryah_: mikeal: i dont know
[23:59] tjholowaychuk: app.set(setting, true)
[23:59] Nexxy: ACTION coughs...
[23:59] tjholowaychuk: same thing
[23:59] Nexxy: enables things?
[23:59] mikeal: heeh, who should know?
[23:59] ryah_: mikeal: seems like those should be on the req
[23:59] tjholowaychuk: arbitrary settings
[23:59] xandrews has joined the channel
[23:59] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: ok... so... how do i check that later?
[23:59] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: app.enabled('my setting')
[23:59] mikeal: agreed
[23:59] isaacs: ok
[23:59] mikeal: they are in the rewrite
[23:59] ryah_: mikeal: whch line?
