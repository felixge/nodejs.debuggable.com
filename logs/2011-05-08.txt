[00:00] a|i: jmoyers: yes, but express.io is vapourware at the moment
[00:00] jmoyers: yes indeed
[00:00] saschagehlich has joined the channel
[00:00] a|i: jmoyers: any links to any resources addressing this concept?
[00:00] jmoyers: so im hacking on something for that purpose, too
[00:00] jmoyers: nope
[00:00] jmoyers: not that i know of
[00:00] jmoyers: i've been thinking about it for 3 days though...
[00:00] a|i: this is a very common problem
[00:01] jmoyers: yes indeedy
[00:01] a|i: we cannot be the first people tackling this
[00:01] jmoyers: you would expect not
[00:01] a|i: so there should be some code out there addressing this
[00:01] jmoyers: maybe somebody who's been in irc longer than i have would know :P
[00:01] a|i: just cannot find the right keyword
[00:01] jmoyers: i've read the mailing list for months now, nothing on that
[00:01] jmoyers: socket.io and node-dev, node
[00:02] a|i: mmm, is it a diffcult problem to solve?
[00:02] jmoyers: not really
[00:02] jmoyers: im imagining something just like expresses middlware
[00:02] jmoyers: takes events, uses a waterfall concept
[00:02] a|i: what does express middleware have to do with this?
[00:03] a|i: how does expresss do authorization?
[00:03] jmoyers: i mean using something exactly like express middleware to handle new data off a socket
[00:03] dypsilon has joined the channel
[00:03] jmoyers: for example -- lets say you get a request from a client to change an entity he doesn't have access to
[00:03] jmoyers: in express, you'd pass in a middleware for a request to do something like requiresRole('admin')
[00:03] jmoyers: or whatever
[00:03] jmoyers: something very similar, but bi-directional i think
[00:04] a|i: jmoyers: but there is something socket case that express doesn have an equivalent:
[00:04] johnhamelink: How do I push raw html to jade?
[00:04] a|i: consider the case when a model changes and you need to inform a specific role about that change
[00:05] jmoyers: yes
[00:05] jmoyers: so i have something in my app that treats clients as a collection
[00:05] moz87: why does socket.io use port 80
[00:05] jmoyers: filters based on the same kind of function as filter concept, where you can morph the data etc
[00:05] moz87: i thought that was for web traffic, i cant start my server on that port because its already in use
[00:06] sarkis: wafflesburger: thanks
[00:06] clee: is there any way to change the http.agent that http.request uses by default?
[00:06] johnhamelink: jmoyers, thanks :)
[00:06] a|i: jmoyers: do you persist that client collection, or is it fine to have it in memory?
[00:06] jmoyers: i keep active clients in memory
[00:06] wafflesburger: no problem
[00:07] jmoyers: i dont persist sub collections, if thats what you mean -- references to just admins or something
[00:07] breccan_ has joined the channel
[00:07] jmoyers: i just use a functional style to select the appropriate clients -- similar to backbone collections with underscore.js mixins
[00:07] jmoyers: im sure i need to store it in a more search friends format, but have no performance concerns atm ;-)
[00:08] a|i: jmoyers: what about performance? when lots and lots of concurrent filtering comes in the games, does it not affect scaling?
[00:08] sarkis: squeeks: good point on the sockets.. i just ran the sample tcp from nodejs.org. This is amazing.
[00:08] jmoyers: it would
[00:08] jmoyers: i think you'd have to build appropriate indexes etc
[00:08] dmojoryder has joined the channel
[00:08] jmoyers: lower the cost of lookup
[00:08] jmoyers: and scale out with a cluster
[00:09] a|i: so, what's a good low-level way of filtering? also, are we talking about model filtering, or attrib filtering?
[00:09] jmoyers: uh, sec

[00:35] sarkis: looking for a url router..
[00:35] A_Nub: sarkis: express
[00:35] jmoyers: express is pretty standard
[00:35] tbranyen: nerve.js looks pretty confusing
[00:36] tbranyen: so many arrays
[00:36] A_Nub: ya, use and love express
[00:36] sarkis: A_Nub: good point, i didn't realize express had that already
[00:36] jmoyers: last commit
[00:36] jmoyers: also
[00:36] sarkis: duhhh
[00:36] A_Nub: its awesome.
[00:36] jmoyers: was many moons ago
[00:36] johnhamelink: jmoyers, I found that you can use !{} to get exactly what you want into the template. #{} will format it for you.
[00:36] sarkis: ok now to make something fun
[00:36] sarkis: and learn some node :P
[00:36] sarkis: thanks guys
[00:37] jmoyers: !{} is unescaped content
[00:37] jmoyers: extending filters is slightly different -- this is if you want to implement your own compiler
[00:37] jmoyers: for instance there is a filter plugin for haml or stylus or whatever
[00:37] jmoyers: those are impl as visitors
[00:37] johnhamelink: jmoyers, that's exactly what I'm wanting - it's already been validated and converted into html :)
[00:37] johnhamelink: so unescaping is fine :)
[00:38] jmoyers: good deal -- some how skimmed over your original intent

[01:25] jhurliman: is there a way to detect if a request is not handled with some number of seconds? i'm using express and a common programming error i run into is where one of my logic paths will fail to return a response to the client. it would be nice to have some sort of watchdog middleware in debugging mode that detects these errors (and/or slow response paths) instead of hanging the socket open indefinitely
[01:26] jmoyers: couldn't you poll the request?
[01:26] jmoyers: i mean that could be impl as middleware

[02:42] tswicegood: ryah: loaded question for you -- with 0.6 looking like it's main goal is Windows support, does that mean we're less than 2 stable releases away from 1.0?
[02:43] squeeks-drunk: tswicegood: even is stable, odd is unstable, load question that most likely isn't.
[02:43] squeeks-drunk: (speak like yoda I don't)
[02:43] isaacs: tswicegood: 0.10.1, 0.99.0, 0.1000.2
[02:44] isaacs: tswicegood: Releases will go on as long as they have to.
[02:44] isaacs: :)
[02:45] tswicegood: yeah, but 0.6 plus 0.8 == Windows + clustering (/me is making assumption) == the last two big things ryah mentioned in an article in the last week or two (iirc) as the major outstanding stuff before a 1.0

[03:49] DTrejo: oh!
[03:49] DTrejo: so i don't need to do it myself
[03:49] isaacs: DTrejo: it should only drop that when there's a failure
[03:49] DTrejo: cool
[03:49] chapel: well I don't think he needs to parse it jmoyers, just store it so it can be used again
[03:49] isaacs: just do "npm ls"
[03:50] isaacs: that always works :)
[03:50] chapel: browsers don't parse cookies really, they just store them
[03:50] isaacs: chapel: browsers definitely parse the cookie headers.
[03:50] chapel: and are able to respond with them if the server requests them, idk how that actually works tbh
[03:50] Andre_Turrettini: anybody got any tips on monitoring and auto restarting a node instance?
[03:50] isaacs: they have to keep track of the SecureOnly flag, the server, the path, etc.
[03:51] isaacs: HTTPOnly
[03:51] jmoyers: ^^
[03:51] isaacs: otherwise your browser would send your facebook cookies to my blog.
[03:51] DTrejo: Andre_Turrettini: npm install -g forever
[03:51] DTrejo: forever server.js
[03:51] chapel: okay, but I think for his purposes, he might not need full functionality
[03:51] chapel: but whatever
[03:51] jmoyers: so the problem set is even simpler
[03:51] jmoyers: echo back
[03:52] jmoyers: grab it off the header, its all good
[03:55] Andre_Turrettini: Dtrejo: thanks. I found this link http://blog.nodejitsu.com/keep-a-nodejs-server-up-with-forever. looks nice and simple.

[03:58] isaacs: DTrejo: oh, you know, you can also do `npm explore whatever` to run commands in that package's folder.
[03:58] isaacs: DTrejo: npm explore express -- npm ls
[03:58] DTrejo: woah nice
[03:59] DTrejo: then I won't even have to edit package.json
[03:59] DTrejo: isaacs: one thought: the things with prefer global could have a prompt where it asks if you actually want to install globally. that might be bad though.

[04:02] Marak: SATURDAY NIGHT NODE PARTY LETS DO IT
[04:03] Marak: i think you might be able to pull it off by just making a proper bundle / installer

[04:07] Marak: DTrejo: fucking shit
[04:07] Marak: DTrejo: im retarded, eyes isnt even being used
[04:07] Marak: DTrejo: i removed all the calls, and didnt take out the requires
[04:07] DTrejo: happens, no worries man
[04:07] Marak: pull requests would be epic, im knee deep in three screens right now with jsonloops running
[04:08] rmustacc: Marak: While I'm not really interested in money, how simple an interface are you looking for. Play a song and fire a callback when it finishes?
[04:08] DTrejo: kk, will stop bothering :)
[04:08] DTrejo: woo rmustacc !
[04:08] DTrejo: you have a room named after you
[04:08] Marak: rmustacc: exactly, i need play('pathtofile', function(err) {} );
[04:08] DTrejo: at this school I'm at
[04:08] rmustacc: Marak: I've been meaning to hook something up to the mplayer slave interface.
[04:08] Marak: rmustacc: the real problem is getting it to work with the npm installer i think, node-sfml should do it
[04:09] Marak: rmustacc: i dont know what that is, but i need absolute minimal latency, so id like to hook straight into the OS
[04:09] Marak: with a library that does it
[04:09] AAA_awright: The npm requirement isn't very nice
[04:09] Marak: i think https://github.com/bmeck/node-sfml is the right place
[04:09] Marak: AAA_awright: thats the whole point really, im not ninja enough to write scripts to make it work
[04:10] Marak: i think some bash scripts would do it, or a custom waf
[04:10] AAA_awright: That discriminates against us git-submodule users
[04:10] Marak: i have literally no clue
[04:10] DTrejo: HOW DO I MAKE IT SO CRLF AND LF LINE ENDINGS WILL NEVER BOTHER ME AGAIN?
[04:10] DTrejo: (using git)
[04:11] AAA_awright: Marak: I'm looking at creating a streaming audio server, not quite utilizing actual speakers
[04:11] AAA_awright: But actual speakers would probably be just another output destination for what I have in mind
[04:11] Marak: DTrejo: you can add a git hook to an sh script
[04:11] Marak: DTrejo: i think
[04:11] rmustacc: Marak: Ah, gotcha.
[04:11] DTrejo: hmm, ok

[04:15] Marak: SubStack: is there a standard way to do reconnects with dnode? i was gonna hack in a timer thingy, but i thought maybe it might be a feature worth thinking about to put into dnode core? i dunno

[09:00] dgathright: I don't know enough about audio within OSX/Linux to know how to pull it off.  But I keep thinking of ways to pump it into a browser.  You want cross-platform audio? Use something that's already cross-platform and supports audio.  But, then again, that's not really the point of Node. :)
[09:00] stephank has joined the channel
[09:00] hybsch has joined the channel
[09:03] Marak: dgathright: browser audio is a pipe dream, the only way to pull it off would be a flash guru and porting some of my code from JS to AS3 and several hacks, I can't use ExternalInterface either, the serialization overhead is a joke, fuck the AVM.
[09:03] robhawkes has joined the channel
[09:03] Marak: dgathright: as for server, node-sfml should do it, just need a eloquent way to pack the deps up

[09:06] dgathright: Warning: some demos might crash your computer. :)
[09:07] chapel: hmm, Marak node-sfml installs all the required deps
[09:08] chjj: coding with modern browsers in mind is the only way to go
[09:08] chjj: people need to stop supporting legacy browsers ;)
[09:08] dgathright: ^ this
[09:08] herbySk has joined the channel
[09:09] mendel_: not if you have to deliver to clients whose company still support the old crap browser
[09:09] mendel_: I agree with the statement, but that's just not always possible
[09:09] bastilian_ has joined the channel
[09:10] chjj: then that company is the problem, they need to be made aware that theyre the problem, by having the entire web stop supporting them
[09:10] chjj: maybe one day once their ie6 installation cant load anything anymore, theyll take the hint
[09:10] mendel_: yeah, but then EVERYONE has to do it

[09:19] Marak: that shit was not easy to make
[09:20] stephank: I don't know if it's wise to bundle dependencies for an audio library. Looking at node-sfml, it downloads three library dependencies to do it's thing, and even then fails to "npm install".
[09:20] nexxy: dos imo

[09:21] nexxy: Marak, do you plan on taking jsonloops to a "full featured" sequencer?
[09:21] stephank: Especially on Ubuntu, and probably a most other gnu/linux systems, you need to at least install some headers, for example for pulseaudio. Unless you want to bundle binaries.
[09:21] stagas: Marak: sc is very powerful as in you can make sequencers from scratch, synths, sample players and whatever. bundle that with node and a browser interface and it will rock

[09:23] Marak: nexxy: i could use UI improvements badly
[09:23] Marak: if you know front-end js
[09:23] thedjinn: i have experience with core audio development, might be able to help

[09:27] Marak: nexxy: clone the project, try to install, get the UI running
[09:27] Marak: nexxy: if you can do that ping me, and we can chat about possible UI tweaking
[09:27] Marak: :-)
[09:27] Marak: im about to push a refactor, but it should still run
[09:27] Marak: requires macos
[09:27] Marak: and you gotta pay attention to the ReadMe install, need to compile node as 32 bit
[09:27] Marak: its a PITA

[10:22] quackslike: does anyone know where i can see an example of httpclient downloading binary data that uses Buffer and not the deprecated 'binary' encoding type?
[10:26] chjj: quackslike: 'data' events automatically pass in Buffers now
[10:27] chjj: by default
[10:27] tlrobinson has joined the channel
[10:28] chjj: but if you want to download a file and save it to disk you can do: "var stream = fs.createWriteStream('./file'); res.pipe(stream);"
[10:29] sled has joined the channel
[10:29] quackslike: chjj: so if res.setEncoding('utf8') is not called then does that mean i get a Buffer, otherwise if setEncoding(utf8) is called i get a utf8 characters in a string?
[10:29] sled: hello
[10:29] chjj: quackslike: yes, if no encoding is specified, buffer objects are passed in by default
[10:29] seivan_ has joined the channel
[10:29] quackslike: ah yes that was going to be my next question - would i be better off using pump to write to disk instead of allocating a massive buffer to hold all the bits as they stream in..
[10:30] chjj: quackslike: yeah, just create a file write stream and pipe the responses data into it
[10:30] quackslike: chjj: ok, thank you. i think i have enough to go on for now.
[10:30] quackslike: chjj: cheers - will do.
[10:30] sled: I got a question about the socket.io module (couldn't find a specific irc channel for that module) the problem is that I try to associate data with a client like: socket.on('connection', function(client) { client.connection.set('name', 'dummy'); }); and I always get the error that the client object has no method 'set' 
[10:30] sled: what could be wrong?
[10:31] sled: whoops, soley client.set('name', 'dummy'); ;)

[13:09] stagas: chapel: portaudio looks nice
[13:09] Marak: tmedema: huh?
[13:09] tmedema: Marak: to keep lots of things in sync with dnode
[13:09] tmedema: you just exchange a backbone model
[13:10] Marak: tmedema: yeah, and how does backbone.js do its diff merge aglo again?
[13:10] chapel: stagas: yeah, I spent like 2 hours researching libs
[13:10] Marak: ohh wait, it doesnt
[13:10] Omersd: so i save in redius from first server and read from the second?
[13:10] tmedema: Marak: not sure what algo it uses to find differences, I haven't used it personally.. heard people recommending it though
[13:11] tmedema: I am interested in using it myself

[13:11] Marak: tmedema: it just stomps over changes, its not meant for real-time databinding
[13:11] Marak: you need to build that glue
[13:11] nexxy: woops
[13:11] tmedema: Marak: ah I thought it was heavily optimized for real time synching
[13:12] tmedema: something like that would be a great value adding library for node
[13:12] Marak: tmedema: backbone.js is a client library
[13:12] Marak: tmedema: for MVVC
[13:12] tmedema: Marak, yeah I thought it was modified for node.js
[13:12] Marak: link?
[13:12] tmedema: let me see

[13:13] stagas: chapel: are you going to bind the whole thing or just make a play function
[13:14] chapel: well I wouldn't mind, but I gotta start somewhere :)
[13:15] tmedema: Marak: hmm, just experienced a disappointing 5 minutes in which I failed to find what I thought existed
[13:15] tmedema: so, most likely, I was wrong and it does not exist

[13:18] tmedema: Is it possible to create a ReadStream? I am getting file chunks with node-formidable, but felixge has never implemented it as a stream
[13:18] pomodoro has joined the channel
[13:18] tmedema: so I wish to pass the chunks of data to a stream to pipe it somewhere else to a writable stream
[13:18] tmedema: seems highly inefficient now that I think about it..

[13:21] nexxy: chapel++
[13:21] v8bot:  nexxy has given a beer to chapel. chapel now has 2 beers.
[13:24] stagas: chapel: you're gonna win 400$ ! :P I see it has streams can't you just bind into those?
[13:24] chapel: yeah, that was what I was thinking, but it does have callbacks
[13:24] chapel: so either way
[13:24] chapel: maybe I will just hook into both
[13:25] FireFly: Heh, I started working on OpenAL bindings
[13:25] chapel: the main blocking issue is sndfile
[13:25] chapel: going to put that into the eio or whatever
[13:26] tmedema: Is this the correct way to emulate piping? https://gist.github.com/961370 I cannot use the inbuild pipe method as my incoming data is not a readStream (it's a simple "event emitter" from node-formidable)
[13:26] MrTopf has joined the channel
[13:26] Rob- has joined the channel
[13:26] tmedema: basically, pause on data receival - then resume if write is flushed immediately, otherwise resume if buffer is drained
[13:26] dmojoryder has joined the channel
[13:31] chjj: tmedema: if .write() returns false, pause the read stream and bind to the 'drain' event on the writable stream, once drain occurs, resume the readable stream and start doings writes again
[13:33] maushu has joined the channel
[13:33] tmedema: chjj: hmm that should work as well, is it better than pausing the stream immediately after receiving data?
[13:34] chjj: you should only pause when .write() returns false
[13:34] chjj: that means data is being buffered in memory
[13:34] tmedema: chjj: alright, thanks - this should be what you mean as far as I understand, https://gist.github.com/961374
[13:35] tmedema: or I guess I do not have to encapsulate the resume function with a wrapper
[13:36] chjj: yeah that looks right, is that for a multipart parser or something?
[13:36] jbpros has joined the channel
[13:36] chjj: that stream may behave differently
[13:36] tmedema: chjj: yes it is
[13:36] tmedema: well this is not the whole multipart stream, but a single file stream
[13:37] chjj: tmedema: shouldnt it be part.pause(), part.resume()?
[13:37] chjj: or does it point to the same stream?
[13:37] tmedema: chjj: I do not think he ever implemented a part.pause
[13:37] tmedema: the thing is that when he created this node did not have streames yet
[13:38] tmedema: streams*
[13:38] chjj: yeah, im not sure, that particular stream might behave differently, but it looks correct according to node standards
[13:38] tmedema: alright I will test it, thanks
[13:39] chjj: i think you could also have an on('drain', ...) elsewhere, i think it only drains after write has returned false anyway
[13:39] chjj: but once('drain') should work
[13:40] tmedema: alright
[13:41] chjj: ...everything should be git
[13:41] chjj: im so sick of packaging a google chrome extension to upload it

[14:03] tmedema: quacksalot: no, I am piping uploads to a socket
[14:03] tmedema: chjj: looks nice, just installed it
[14:03] pyrotechnick: how do i open it?
[14:03] quacksalot: tmedema: oh ok.
[14:04] tmedema: pyrotechnick: you have to restart the browser
[14:04] tmedema: and press f9
[14:04] chjj: dont have to restart the browser
[14:04] chjj: reload the tab
[14:04] chjj: refresh
[14:04] tmedema: chjj: you sure? I did have to
[14:04] chjj: hm weird
[14:04] tmedema: that did not work for me
[14:04] quacksalot: the reason i ask is because i need to do somthing with uploads soon.. but havent really looked at a solution yet.
[14:04] chjj: its a content script, because of the way google chrome extensions work, it will only work in tabs with js enabled
[14:05] pyrotechnick: very cool chjj
[14:05] tmedema: quacksalot: well formidable is really the only solution at the moment, it is great really.. if it were not outdated.
[14:05] chjj: thanks
[14:05] pyrotechnick: i might build stylus into this...
[14:05] chjj: haha, i was thinking of adding some kind of preprocessor
[14:05] pyrotechnick: do u have it on github
[14:05] tmedema: felixge has added like 20 issues as a roadmap to modernize it; although development is not that active it seems
[14:05] chjj: theres already an "unminify" option

[14:06] quacksalot: tmedema: maybe i'll have a go..
[14:08] tmedema: quacksalot: there were some issues with multiple files
[14:08] tmedema: not sure if they have been resolved
[14:08] tmedema: maybe just by flash uploaders
[14:08] quacksalot: pretty happy with how easy it was to get amazon ec2 free tier and node up and running..
[14:09] chjj: everyones usin ec2 nowadays
[14:09] chjj: might have to look into it
[14:09] quacksalot: tmedema: ok.
[14:09] tmedema: Is there something weird in Node with modules and object references? I've got an object in module A and reference it to module B, module B modifies it.. when I inspect it afterwards in module A it is unchanged! Any ideas what could be the issue here?
[14:09] quacksalot: chjj: a year for free(almost free) :)
[14:10] tmedema: quacksalot: free cloud hosting? where?
[14:11] tmedema: I was thinking about using www.100tb.com because I need a lot of bandwidth
[14:11] tmedema: but they just shutdown a CDN, because of high bandwidth usage
[14:11] chjj: quacksalot: say what? a year for free?
[14:11] chjj: where do i sign up?
[14:11] quacksalot: i followed this: http://rsms.me/2011/03/23/ec2-wep-app-template.html
[14:12] quacksalot: http://aws.amazon.com/free/
[14:12] quacksalot: installed a ubuntu micro today, did a node and npm install - easy as pie.

[14:14] quacksalot: yeah its a lot of waffle..
[14:14] quacksalot: i figured i had a sunday arvo to spend messing around..
[14:14] chjj: yeah, 2.73 cents per 1.18 seconds
[14:14] markwubben has joined the channel
[14:14] chjj: thats their price
[14:14] tmedema: Anyway, between modules objects are still passed by reference right? I'm experiencing some strange behavior..
[14:14] chjj: its always some stupid rate
[14:15] quacksalot: tmedema: it sounds odd because the change should be reflected if its the same intance of the module
[14:15] chjj: i feel like this ad hasnt actually told me anything

[14:16] tmedema: quacksalot: why just within that instance? objects are passed by reference so it shouldn't matter
[14:16] tmedema: it's just one object
[14:16] quacksalot: i think it depends how you code it.

[14:21] tmedema: nevermind me, just discovered a flaw in logic
[14:21] tmedema: it is free if you have almost no traffic :p
[14:21] chjj: lol
[14:21] chjj: yeah, i dont wanna get it up and then have em jack me for bandwidth
[14:22] tmedema: same here
[14:22] tmedema: I'm too risk averse for such dynamic system
[14:22] quacksalot: yeah, some of the images are rather large and they basically take up everything you get for free, so adding stuff incurs a minor cost(0.0.25c/something) or whatever.. but if you choose one of the images (AMI's) listed on that page they weigh in really small so i think that keeps you in the clear..
[14:23] chjj: that ad was like a fractal advertisement, they just used a bunch of buzz-word services, they were like "cloud map-reduce webscale free as3 ec2 a100 suite"
[14:23] quacksalot: meh. its only money.. :)
[14:23] quacksalot: chjj: hahaha

[14:41] a|i: doesn't make sense
[14:42] dawg: dunno
[14:42] a|i: eventmachine + ruby interpreter is slower than node + v8
[14:43] chjj: a|i, i dont know if thats true, but to me nodes selling point is the beauty of all IO united under a common scripting language, and everything made async so its not necessary to deal with threads
[14:43] chjj: very elegant

[14:49] dawg: if you're coding in 2 places
[14:49] chjj: vms can be pretty nice
[14:49] dawg: ?
[14:49] dawg: and exchanging files
[14:50] zoowee: the files never need to get exchanged
[14:50] zoowee: they can exist in one place
[14:50] zoowee: you could write code on windows through an sftp with 
[14:51] zoowee: aptana or something
[14:51] dawg: cool idea man
[14:51] dawg: or isnt it possible
[14:51] dawg: to use FTP through windows explorer?
[14:51] dawg: so i can edit files through windows on the linux machine
[14:52] zoowee: yea but a shared drive takes care of that through virtual box 
[14:52] zoowee: like for example i share a "working" dir
[14:52] zoowee: inside of which are a bunch of projects that I could be editing from inside the vm or on windows
[14:53] dawg: i see
[14:53] dawg: you cant do that in vmware right
[14:53] zoowee: im sure you can ... its usually through "guest additions"

[14:57] chjj: hmmm, a lot of people are getting into the whole node preprocessor thing now, to abstract away callbacks
[14:58] chjj: callbacks arent that bad, people just get offended by so much indentation i think
[14:59] quacksalot: chjj: i think thats becuase a lot of people put everything in to one file.. and end up with a deep nest..
[14:59] chjj: yeah
[14:59] zoowee: callbacks brought me to node
[14:59] bshumate has joined the channel
[14:59] chjj: well you could put it in one file without several levels of indentation

[15:00] chjj: =/
[15:00] chjj: but i do understand what youre saying
[15:00] quacksalot: i like to split my stuff up so a module is more like a class

[15:03] chjj: javascript on the serverside is hardcore stuff compared to the client
[15:04] chjj: two very different worlds

[15:06] chjj: but i still havent lost my desire to do frontend stuff
[15:06] quacksalot: i quite like flex and as3 for doing UI stuff.. it works well and is always the same, as3 is pretty good.
[15:07] quacksalot: the flex framework is pretty hacked together though when you look at the source.. i think the interns might have written a good lot of it..

[15:08] chjj: is that some flash thing?
[15:08] chjj: i dont touch flash with a 10ft pole

[15:09] a|i: that hardware acceleration checkbox, that is a joke.
[15:09] chjj: a|i, thats not even the worse part about flash
[15:09] chjj: its just a hacky buggy sloppy plugin
[15:10] chjj: full of loopholes and exploits
[15:10] chjj: so glad apple screwed them over
[15:10] a|i: chjj: but it has some stuff that no other plugin has, video was one of them, and now, p2p is another one.
[15:10] a|i: we have to accept no other plugin has done that.
[15:11] chjj: yeah, hopefully once apple and microsoft stop being childish we can have a common video format for the web though
[15:11] chjj: .webm*
[15:11] a|i: remember 10 years ago, where for watching a 5 sec videoclip you had to install media player and real player and other crap? flash did solve that problem.
[15:11] chjj: oh god
[15:11] quacksalot: while flash has its problems, resources, security, stability etc. it doesnt change the fact flex is pretty good to build UI stuff with. IMO.
[15:11] chjj: oh man
[15:11] chjj: real player
[15:11] chjj: that was
[15:11] chjj: the worst piece of software
[15:11] chjj: ever written
[15:12] zoowee: quacksalot++
[15:12] v8bot:  zoowee has given a beer to quacksalot. quacksalot now has 1 beers.
[15:12] squeeks: Hey, want to know something? People still use Real.
[15:12] jdp has joined the channel
[15:12] a|i: quacksalot: the problem with flex ui is that, you really don't want to have a website which is base don flex ui :)
[15:12] a|i: the ui doesn't feel native.
[15:12] chjj: yeah i do remember that, like ~10 years ago
[15:12] zoowee: quacksalot:" my UIs always look really utilitarian" haha nice
[15:13] pyrotechnick: anyone here pretty good at redis?
[15:13] chjj: flash is still bad though, and theres better alternatives
[15:13] pyrotechnick: got some higher level questions for you
[15:13] chjj: its a plugin - i dont even think i have to go beyond that to explain why its bad
[15:14] a|i: chjj: don't forget, if there was no flash, there was no youtube. some people got really rally rich because of flash.
[15:14] quacksalot: a|i: agree for public web sites; but for business apps behind the firewall - its a good fit for building some things and the dev environment has some good aspects too :)
[15:15] quacksalot: zoowee: cheers!
[15:15] a|i: quacksalot: yes, for internal use it's a quick way to go.
[15:15] a|i: anyone here using socket.io 0.7? is it even runnable?
[15:16] quacksalot: a|i: its always a case for the right tool for the job..
[15:16] a|i: socket is really under-documented.
[15:16] chjj: im having flashbacks to 10 years ago, watching videos with real player, never remind me of that again
[15:16] catshirt has joined the channel
[15:16] ryan_: socket.io is being a real pain for me right now.
[15:16] quacksalot: zoowee: even i can build a nice looking UI using flex! :D

[15:17] zoowee: quacksalot: i try to stay away from solutions like that
[15:17] zoowee: thus my UI's look really crappy
[15:18] zoowee: i get by with jqueryui and occasionally yui 
[15:18] quacksalot: zoowee: if it were up to me, our clients would be using a terminal :)
[15:19] zoowee: quacksalot: i agree for the most part
[15:19] zoowee: quacksalot: it would mean a much more productive workforce
[15:20] zoowee: i do SAP stuff for work and its actually awesomely efficient 
[15:20] zoowee: lots of text
[15:20] quacksalot: zoowee: my managers always want UI's for stupid configuration stuff.. takes a week longer to build the config UI's etc and all they do is change a couple files and stick some values in the DB. :-/ gives me the shits.
[15:21] zoowee: quacksalot: haha

[15:24] quacksalot: anyhoo.. i've got the pleasure of building something silly like than in about 7 hours from now.. so might have to get some sleep to enable me to cope with the stupidity of it all..
[15:24] zoowee: quacksalot: goodluck

[16:04] pyrotechnick: i considered taking over right click

[16:05] pyrotechnick: tech heads
[16:05] pyrotechnick: not noobs

[16:07] marcello3d: really?
[16:07] bernowly has left the channel
[16:07] pyrotechnick: yeah its awkward
[16:07] pyrotechnick: one of the reasons i always plug in a mouse
[16:07] pyrotechnick: we're not really targeting notebooks though so its a fairly low priority
[16:07] marcello3d: weird
[16:07] pyrotechnick: webgl is a monster
[16:07] pyrotechnick: notebooks cant cool properly
[16:07] marcello3d: I always have multiple fingers on the touchpad. for scrolling mainly
[16:08] pyrotechnick: its not rly a trackpad game
[16:08] marcello3d: the difference between index vs index + middle finger is inconsequential, not much different from using an external mous
[16:08] marcello3d: but regardless
[16:08] pyrotechnick: anyway if i used right click it would be for destroying blocks
[16:08] marcello3d: you're suggesting not using right click at all
[16:08] pyrotechnick: but im doing to avoid it
[16:08] pyrotechnick: yes
[16:09] pyrotechnick: we're trying to follow standards as much as it makes sense
[16:09] pyrotechnick: for instance we will have media be able to be embedded in chat

[16:11] pyrotechnick: thats a convention in many rts
[16:11] pyrotechnick: or <>
[16:13] marcello3d: for just z axis rotation?

[16:39] stephank: hehehe
[16:40] pyrotechnick: stephank: i think i've got it
[16:40] stephank: Still, I think the only things we lack is a convenience library around http, which is his RestClient, and a startup wrapper, because express basically expects all parameters in code (bind port and stuff)

[16:43] stephank: pyrotechnick: Don't do that. If it's as simple as "fetch url, (data) -> render data", that's elegant enough, right?
[16:43] remysharp: Can anyone tell me how I can set a custom mime-type for static content in Connect? i.e. sending a .appcache file
[16:43] stephank: not sure if zappa's render works that way, tbh
[16:44] pyrotechnick: stephank: yeah but he's using some kind of synchronous Sinatra thing

[16:45] pyrotechnick: stephank: i dont think it's actually sync

[16:46] markwubben has joined the channel
[16:46] stephank: pyrotechnick: Nah, sinatra runs on Rack, which is like Ruby's Connect. But it's synchronous; scaling is done with process, afaik.
[16:46] aguynamedben has joined the channel
[16:46] stephank: processes*
[16:46] marcello3d: pita: also it's nice to use new Error() instead of plain strings so there's a stack trace
[16:46] pyrotechnick: they havent made it eventmachine compat yet?
[16:47] squeeks: stephank: rack is more like jack, surely.
[16:47] pyrotechnick: squeeks: it's analogous to connect
[16:47] pyrotechnick: maybe moreso to jack
[16:47] pyrotechnick: but that doesnt mean its unlike connect
[16:47] stephank: pyrotechnick: Whether a server hosting a rack app uses eventmachine, is up to the server. There's a server called Thin that uses it, and add some hacks to make it async aware, but it's non-standard
[16:48] squeeks: Oh, I'm not saying it isn't unlike connect at all. But JSGI/Jack came first :P

[17:24] mattp_: require('./routes/post')(app);
[17:25] mattp_: what does passing in the app object do in a require like this? 
[17:26] aguynamedben has joined the channel
[17:26] stephank: mattp_: the 'routes/post' module simply does 'module.exports = function (app) { ... }', which means the require() call returns that function. The second pair of parens calls that function.

[17:42] stephank: pyrotechnick: Good find. I wonder if that'll be the future of scaling Ruby.
[17:43] pyrotechnick: it already is, it's still slow though
[17:45] stephank: Well, it's there, sure, but it's not standard. I haven't done much Ruby the last couple of months, but I don't know of scaling using async in production.
[17:45] stephank: know of anyone doing scaling using async*
[17:45] pyrotechnick: i've heard a couple of managers at meetups talk about node vs evented ruby
[17:46] pyrotechnick: node's still almost an order faster
[17:46] ryan_ has joined the channel
[17:46] pyrotechnick: they said it's so good it's bad
[17:46] pyrotechnick: too many clients on one server
[17:46] pyrotechnick: if it crashes it's horrible
[17:46] pyrotechnick: whereas if ruby crashed there wasnt many clients on it so it didnt matter that much
[17:46] stephank: haha
[17:46] pyrotechnick: now it's like entire games worth of players crashing on a single node :P
[17:46] halfhalo: ACTION totally has his next project done in his head
[17:46] stephank: that's kinda silly.
[17:47] SubStack: websocket reconnects can mitigate that
[17:47] pyrotechnick: SubStack: these weren't browser games
[17:47] pyrotechnick: iOS/android ones
[17:47] SubStack: ah
[17:47] stephank: I'd still feel better about the lower load, overall. Even if you eventually deploy on more servers or processes than necessary to mitigate crash impact.
[17:47] pyrotechnick: native sockets i guess
[17:48] pyrotechnick: i mean for all intents and purposes they could be js games
[17:48] pyrotechnick: but apple have deliberately nerfed the browser so they had to go the whole webkit view thing
[17:49] halfhalo: Webos ftw
[17:50] a|i: what does 'pushing to a client' mean in redis pubsub? does redis push?!
[17:50] a|i: http://redis.io/topics/pubsub
[17:51] pyrotechnick: yes
[17:51] a|i: redis pushes to browsers?
[17:51] pyrotechnick: it sends data on the socket if it's subscribed to a channel that receives a message
[17:51] pyrotechnick: to a redis client, no
[17:51] pyrotechnick: redis client = something connected to redis on the server
[17:51] pyrotechnick: you could write a simple proxy
[17:51] pyrotechnick: SubStack: couldn't you
[17:52] pyrotechnick: how many lines do you think? 10? less?
[17:52] SubStack: no idea!
[17:52] SubStack: haven't used redis
[17:52] pyrotechnick: i think not many
[17:52] a|i: but does redis use the term 'push'?
[17:52] pyrotechnick: client.on "message", (channel, message) ->
[17:52] pyrotechnick: thats all it is substack
[17:52] guybrush: pyrotechnick: 10lines will do it :p
[17:53] pyrotechnick: push that thru to dnode
[17:53] pyrotechnick: would be like 2 lines lol
[17:53] guybrush: 10lines is server+client
[17:53] pyrotechnick: yep
[17:53] pyrotechnick: a|i: https://github.com/mranney/node_redis
[17:53] pyrotechnick: pub/sub section
[17:53] guybrush: dnode makes it so simple it is just stunning
[17:53] pyrotechnick: you'll see about the pushing
[17:53] jonaslund has joined the channel
[17:54] guybrush: you can do it with nowjs too, but i prefer dnode
[17:54] jonaslund: loosen up?
[17:54] Marak: dnode is the shit
[17:54] Marak: fuck nowjs
[17:54] a|i: pyrotechnick: thanks, is that the only, or the most used, node wrapper for redis?
[17:54] pyrotechnick: nowjs needs tests first
[17:54] guybrush: Marak++
[17:54] v8bot:  guybrush has given a beer to Marak. Marak now has 1 beers.
[17:54] guybrush: lol
[17:54] pyrotechnick: then i'll give it a decent review
[17:54] Marak: nowjs is a joke
[17:55] Jin has joined the channel
[17:55] Jin: wow
[17:55] a|i: Why so many Redis clients for node?
[17:56] pyrotechnick: SubStack: it's a shame you dont have the "multi-million dollar contracts with companies for supporting dnode" like the nowjs guys do *snicker*
[17:56] guybrush: why not :p
[17:56] pyrotechnick: a|i: just use the one i linked you it's the best
[17:56] jonaslund: a|i: low barrier to entry
[17:56] SubStack: pyrotechnick: I'll just probably end up writing something like that for free
[17:56] guybrush: thats how you do it!
[17:56] SubStack: I gave dnode clustering a shot a while back
[17:56] SubStack: will probably revisit
[17:57] pyrotechnick: you better, want me to start a bounty? thats all the rage these days
[17:57] SubStack: haha

[17:57] pyrotechnick: inverse-kickstarter
[17:57] pyrotechnick: we had started it a long time ago but now there's some momentum we're revisiting it
[17:57] krikulis: I'm making TLS client in node.js. How do I get details about server certificate ?
[17:57] pyrotechnick: we're not going to hold charges on CCs like kickstarter though, fuck amazon payments
[17:58] Xano: I'm looking for a module that lets me build a DOM and export it to formatted XML. There are a handful of modules that let you build XML, but some can't do what I need and others require a very complex JSON structure.
[17:59] a|i: anyone having their node apps on cloudfoundary? look too buggy to me.

[18:00] halfhalo: It works really well for the most part
[18:01] a|i: halfhalo: it works better for node I guess, but has many problems with rails.
[18:01] a|i: instead of updating my apps, I have to deleted them and create them again, duh.
[18:01] halfhalo: Yeah, the one rails app I tried to setup isn't exactly working
[18:01] jonaslund: a|i: bah, lots of talented people has passed through microsoft
[18:01] jonaslund: lots of good people work there aswell
[18:01] a|i: jonaslund: like the latex creator?
[18:02] jonaslund: some MS products are even good
[18:02] jonaslund: as a whole.. yeah they've done enough to earn alot of shit
[18:02] halfhalo: I really want it to work though, I truly want an OSS paas to run all my stuff on.
[18:02] jonaslund: but don't take that on people who has left already
[18:02] a|i: jonaslund: the ex ms person in cf is not a programmer, he's one of those managers who write 0 lines of code.

[18:24] zoowee: viapow: the spin is a little anoying

[18:26] jonaslund: a|i: A good manager who understands programmers is worth ALOT. I had the good fortune to be managed by a guy who was really excellent at sheparding projects to completion once after being on an infinite death walk.  (I later heard that he had bombed fatally on a from-scratch project)
[18:26] vicapow: zoowee: good point
[18:27] vicapow: zoowee: any suggestions on what would be better?
[18:27] jonaslund: a|i: And that he as a manager has left MS with Monkeyboy at the rudder doesn't seem to be a negative point :D

[18:28] zoowee: vicapow: a bucket?
[18:28] a|i: jonaslund: sure, there are exceptions. but an average manager is some dude with some mba who does not understand the technological challanges, simply because he has not coded for a decade or two.
[18:28] __tosh has joined the channel
[18:29] jonaslund: pita++
[18:29] v8bot:  jonaslund has given a beer to pita. pita now has 1 beers.
[18:29] vicapow: zoowee: instead of the loading spinner?
[18:29] jonaslund: a|i: I'm in the camp who thinks that good manager might be better off without actually knowing the technology
[18:30] a|i: jonaslund: that's not logical, you cannot manage something that you don't have knoledge of.
[18:30] jonaslund: a|i: This guy i'm thinking off had probably never touched a line of code
[18:30] zoowee: vicapow: yea unless the loading spinner waiting for something to load?
[18:30] jonaslund: a|i: I've seen plenty of fuckups who's coded alot however
[18:31] vicapow: zoowee: well, the thumbnail of the link should replace the spinner once it loads. it that not what its doing for you?
[18:31] jonaslund: a|i: Sure you can, if you can grasp what he work is about and ask people the right questions
[18:32] zoowee: vicapow: nope :-(
[18:32] jonaslund: a|i: That's why a technically competent manager can be a problem, they might get a vague description without a time estimate and extrapolate eventhough they haven't done a single line of code in the related project (and thus miss dependencies)
[18:32] vicapow: zoowee: you have to refresh for the link to show up?
[18:32] kryptom has joined the channel
[18:32] jonaslund: a|i: Then get stressed out when his time estimate goes to shit
[18:33] zoowee: vicapow: if if force the page to stop loading the favicon comes through
[18:33] a|i: jonaslund: no way, you must go through what real programmers go through to  understand them. if you grasp what surgeons do, and if you ask surgeons the right questions, can you lead a surgery team?
[18:33] awenkhh has joined the channel
[18:33] jonaslund: a|i: As i said.. this guy was excellent at finishing a project. What he did was ask people what they thought about time consumption, monitored that, and if things started slipping he looked at trends and got people to do the right things.
[18:33] jonaslund: a|i: And he had the guts to ask what needed to be cut to catch some deadline
[18:34] jonaslund: a|i: Now.. that might be very contraproductive if you need to do a fresh project
[18:34] vicapow: zoowee: hmm. there just we issues with socket.io. its supposed to notify the browser when it gets the link. what browser are you using?

[18:34] jonaslund: it was perfect
[18:34] a|i: jonaslund: i personally would not enjoy working with a manager with no technical background.
[18:34] zoowee: vicapow: chrome 11.0.696
[18:34] zoowee: vicapow: i have similar issues with socket.io
[18:35] dawg: pff
[18:35] vicapow: zoowee: im assuming its degrading to some other socket method. I guess it tries and keeps the request alive instead of using web sockets
[18:35] dawg: i dont understand virtualbox
[18:35] dawg: when i shutdown
[18:35] dawg: and start a machine
[18:35] jonaslund: a|i: technical background gives you a head start on asking the right questions, it's nothing magic and a whole lot simpler than actually developing stuff.
[18:35] dawg: i have to reinstall the OS???
[18:36] zoowee: vicapow: falls back to longpolls
[18:36] jonaslund: a|i: I don't think a non-technical manager can manage a start-up project

[18:36] zoowee: stopped*
[18:36] vicapow: zoowee: you start using something else?

[18:39] a|i: jonaslund: now you're saying not only non-technical managers are the good ones, but managers with technical background cannot be successful.
[18:39] jonaslund: a|i: However at some point if you plan on turning it into something mature you need to think about how to proceed

[18:40] a|i: jonaslund: think of TeX, was written by 1 single programmer, it's the most dominant text processing platform, and will be for many centuries. the man behind it didn't have mba and crap like that.

[18:45] DTrejo: (the online tutorials are nice, but not sure how they apply to this situation)
[18:46] gaYak: a|i: Non-technical managers have their benefits also, don't overlook them. Often technical managers are pretty bad in leading people.
[18:46] gaYak: And this is especially true with women in my opinion, they're much better at managing persons and people.
[18:46] gaYak: Whether you need that in a small startup is different question, but when the company grows, you will.

[18:52] jonaslund: however after hearing about all the drama my GF has told about at her mostly female workplace i'm pretty certain that women aren't better at managing really

[19:14] dhasenan: stisti, have your scripts checksum themselves and warn that they're unsupported if the checksum's invalid.
[19:15] squeeks: dhasenan: then just modify the checksum value when you change the code.
[19:15] squeeks: or remove the check all together.
[19:16] zoowee: dhasenan: i will start to do this
[19:16] dhasenan: Granted, but then you can just check whether that check was removed first off.

[19:23] dhasenan: tyler-iphone, you could distribute it as native code, but that probably requires modifying v8.

[19:23] squeeks: tyler-iphone: but why would you?
[19:24] dhasenan: tyler-iphone, maybe you could look at ironjs/node.net?
[19:24] tyler-iphone: dhasenan: would it run faster, since it didn't have to do initial pre-compile?
[19:24] dhasenan: I wouldn't count on it.
[19:24] tyler-iphone: maybe im thinking of it too much like java
[19:25] dhasenan: JIT costs are usually tiny compared to program runtime.

[19:39] Swimming_bird has joined the channel
[19:39] pyrotechnick: MehdiRuby: sorry but node isn't compatible with ie6
[19:39] pyrotechnick: until ie6 is POSIX compliant it wont be able to run in ie6
[19:40] MehdiRuby: so we need to use one of the fallbacks
[19:40] jesusabdullah: wat
[19:40] MehdiRuby: to make it compatible?
[19:40] halfhalo: you never know.... ie6 could get an update!
[19:40] boogyman: ^ lol
[19:40] pyrotechnick: yeah i think they could add support for POSIX one day to ie6 retro-actively
[19:40] pyrotechnick: but i woudlnt hold my breath
[19:40] gaYak: Actually with IE6 explotis you could probably support POSIX in it through Windows' POSIX subsystem..
[19:40] pyrotechnick: that's true
[19:41] gmanika: ActivePOSIX
[19:41] pyrotechnick: MehdiRuby: it
[19:41] pyrotechnick: yeah
[19:41] pyrotechnick: MehdiRuby: it would be very hard, it's probably not legal either
[19:41] jesusabdullah: I'd love to see that though
[19:41] pyrotechnick: me too
[19:41] MehdiRuby: now.js if you heard about it 
[19:41] jesusabdullah: Look again. Your browser is now diamonds!
[19:42] pyrotechnick: MehdiRuby: dnode > now.js
[19:42] MehdiRuby: "NowJS v0.5 is supported in Chrome, Opera, Safari, Firefox, iPad/iPhone/iPod Touch, Android, webOS, Internet Explorer 9, and has beta support for IE8/7/6"
[19:42] pyrotechnick: it's tested
[19:42] pyrotechnick: MehdiRuby: yes node can be used to serve pages to ie6
[19:43] pyrotechnick: nodejs is a server, whether it's compatible with ie6 or not is up to whatever you choose to serve
[19:43] MehdiRuby: Right
[19:43] tbranyen: nowjs has custom javascript that runs on the client tho
[19:43] jesusabdullah: Oh good, a reasonable response
[19:43] pyrotechnick: :p
[19:43] jesusabdullah: but that's a question about whether now.js is compatible with ie6, not  whether node.js is compatible with a browser
[19:43] jesusabdullah: whatever that means

[19:45] pyrotechnick: its for work

[19:46] draginx: I was hoping for something like the ruby community has…. just a quick setup itll do the /register /login /forgot_password all on it's own, etc.
[19:46] pyrotechnick: yeah like warden or something
[19:46] pyrotechnick: id do it at the connect level honestly
[19:46] draginx: yeah
[19:46] halfhalo: I want one as well
[19:46] halfhalo: ACTION cries
[19:46] AntelopeSalad: i would start with connect or express
[19:46] draginx: Would be cool to be able to integrate it into backbone and/or expressjs nicely
[19:46] jesusabdullah: There are at least two projects that do this at the connect level
[19:47] draginx: Or just have a config option this wya it's not so limited
[19:47] halfhalo: ended up making a hackish one using express, sequelize, and express-namespace
[19:47] jesusabdullah: node-sesame is one
[19:47] pyrotechnick: link

[19:49] jesusabdullah: I think express already has req.session but doesn't save it for later
[19:49] halfhalo: express-namespace is a module thingamagigger that makes routing easier, sequelize is a mysql orm frigger
[19:49] draginx: right but it seems like expressjs does this O-o
[19:49] draginx: ahhh
[19:49] draginx: so its not a real session? :p
[19:49] draginx: halfhalo: ah thanks :)
[19:49] jesusabdullah: Well

[20:42] guybrush: at least i do that
[20:42] tbranyen: why do you need an interval if you're using watchFile?
[20:43] gkatsev: [algo]: perhaps you want something like node-dev that will reload the node program when you save the file?
[20:43] [algo]: gkatsev: yes
[20:43] [algo]: and if node dies, it should behave sanely
[20:43] mattp_: if you add vars to the global object, do they get imported into scope? or do you need to access them always through globals.var
[20:43] gkatsev: [algo]: https://github.com/fgnass/node-dev
[20:44] tbranyen: mattp_: scope resolution will go to global
[20:44] [algo]: gkatsev: I'm using express
[20:44] [algo]: it has other types of files besides JS
[20:44] [algo]: will node-dev do?
[20:44] gkatsev: [algo]: doesn't matter.
[20:45] gkatsev: well, it probably doesn't matter if you change an html file since the node server would just get the most up to date html file or w/e
[20:45] [algo]: notify features work when my node.js is on different server?

[22:52] Ratty_: Hi, I'm trying to install the lated 'npm' but the installer script wouldn't work unless I was root. Secondly, after installing when I do 'npm install whatever' it installs it in the current directly, which seems a bit stupid.
[22:52] Ratty_: Any ideas what's up?

[23:12] towns: Ratty_: You need to use the -g flag to install modules globally
[23:12] towns: Otherwise it installs them in a node_modules directory in your current directory
[23:13] towns: Actually these days installing them locally in your project is the preferred way to install them according to issacs
[23:13] Ratty_: Oh :/
[23:13] Ratty_: Things have changed since I  last used it
[23:13] Stephen: I contend that it depends on your usage
[23:14] towns: True. Thats why npm supports both.
[23:14] Stephen: If you're writing a server with no intent on distributing code, globally makes more sense, especially in dev environments
[23:14] towns: But at nodeconf issacs was pushing people to give local install a chance.
[23:14] Stephen: But if you plan on checking the project into npm, probably best to have it local
[23:15] Stephen: I can see how local install would make for cleaner / more concise code
[23:15] Stephen: and fewer problems with installs down the road

[23:17] Stephen: I'm using findAndModify from node-mongodb-native, and I have a certain use case I'm not sure how to handle
[23:18] yogurt_truck has joined the channel
[23:18] Stephen: A collection called Pages, and a Page Object has a property "Parts" which is itself an array.
[23:19] Stephen: When I use findAndModify, I'm finding a single page and performing a $pop from the Parts array.
[23:20] Stephen: Now here's the problem: I'd like for findAndModify to return the Page object, even if there is no Part object to pop from the array.
[23:20] Stephen: Currently, the Page only returns if the pop is successful.
[23:20] Stephen: Anyone have advice on how I should approach this?

[23:53] quackslike: Stephen: not if you update to 9.4 - you will only receive a count of number of objects updated (at least that's my understanding of it) i coded to not rely on the return value of update based on this info.

[23:59] Stephen: If there's somewhere to read the futures, I'm going to need to be up to date
