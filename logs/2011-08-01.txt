[00:03] tbranyen: good 1
[00:03] MooGoo: why is v8 regressing
[00:04] MooGoo: all v8 has over spidermonkey is a little spead
[00:04] MooGoo: speed

[00:10] MooGoo: what's next...the removal of __proto__?
[00:11] mikeal has joined the channel
[00:11] SubStack: hopefully
[00:11] tbranyen: urgh why hopefully
[00:11] SubStack: sublimating features are awesome
[00:11] tbranyen: r u insane
[00:11] SubStack: Object.getPrototypeOf
[00:11] SubStack: much better
[00:11] MooGoo: so long as they add Object.setPrototypeOf
[00:12] tbranyen: sure lets break shit tons of stuff
[00:12] MooGoo: which they wont
[00:12] tbranyen: yeah exactly, and not making it mutable
[00:12] ryah: ACTION rolls his eyes
[00:12] tbranyen: f that
[00:12] tbranyen: best part about proto is being able to set it
[00:12] eboyjr has joined the channel
[00:12] monokrome: What would the point of calling it setPrototypeOf instead of setPrototype?...
[00:12] SubStack: you can always add extra syntax in userspace
[00:13] tbranyen: ... there is literally no reason to remove __proto__ any more than removing substr
[00:13] SubStack: the problem with features is that you pretty much can't ever make them go away in a language as widely used as javascript
[00:13] MooGoo: but userspace cannot directly maniupulate the prototype chain without __proto__
[00:13] ryah: if you want some advice: don't nerd out on the details of programming languages - it's not worth it
[00:13] ryah: just accomplish your task
[00:13] tbranyen: it is when you use it every day...
[00:13] MooGoo: wat
[00:13] tbranyen: how?
[00:13] MooGoo: wat kind of advice is that
[00:14] SubStack: I hope javascript never gets yield
[00:14] ryah: pragmatic
[00:14] SubStack: that will ruin everything
[00:14] MooGoo: Javascript really will become a bastard stepchild of Java if so much resistence is given to every single proposed language extension
[00:14] ryah: MooGoo: it's not the little things that matter
[00:14] monokrome: Why not?
[00:14] MooGoo: of course it is
[00:14] MooGoo: details
[00:15] MooGoo: we use the language every day....yet we are not supposed to push its limits
[00:15] ryah: it's what you can accomplish with it
[00:15] MooGoo: we code on the server yet we are still expected to pretend our code has to run on IE6
[00:16] craigcondon has left the channel
[00:16] tim_smart: MooGoo: Who said that?
[00:16] Bonuspunkt: even google stoped suporting IE6
[00:16] MooGoo: hyperbole tim_smart 
[00:16] tbranyen: ryah: i use __proto__ consistently to set defaults to option objects, its the beauty of objects having a prototype
[00:16] tbranyen: dunno how that'd be elegant any other way
[00:16] monokrome: MooGoo: If you don't code to support the client, then you might have to rewrite it all for the client :)
[00:17] tim_smart: tbranyen: I use __proto__ extensively for inheritence etc
[00:17] ryah: elegance does not come from details
[00:17] tbranyen: yeah
[00:17] ryah: i painful set optional arguments all the time
[00:17] MooGoo: using __proto__ for inheritience makes inheritience far more direct and sane
[00:17] SubStack: tim_smart: you should probably not do that
[00:17] ryah: it's awful
[00:17] craigcondon has joined the channel
[00:17] tbranyen: its a dumb argument anyways, v8 will not remove __proto__ for years
[00:17] tbranyen: too much reliance on it
[00:17] ryah: but the whole of my project is elegant
[00:17] tim_smart: SubStack: It will be depreciated, I know in favour of <| or w/e
[00:17] tbranyen: it'll be deprecated
[00:17] tbranyen: yeah
[00:17] MooGoo: JS should have had __proto__ or some equivilent from the begining
[00:17] thriple has joined the channel
[00:18] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[00:18] monokrome: So, how much code will you have written in years that will require refactoring?
[00:18] SubStack: I want less features in javascript, not more
[00:18] SubStack: less exposed surface area
[00:18] craigcondon has joined the channel
[00:18] tim_smart: The es.next spec is starting to scare me
[00:18] ryah: less to nerd out on
[00:18] MooGoo: the language is already pretty slim
[00:18] MooGoo: what more could be removed
[00:18] SubStack: easier to support, easier to reason about, less to learn
[00:19] ryah: your nerd power should be focused on solving a problem - not the best way to run regular expressions
[00:19] SubStack: all this extra crap should be in user space
[00:19] MooGoo: I support the removal of features in JS so long as no functionality is lost
[00:19] MooGoo: ie those features can be reimplamented by user code
[00:19] ryah: /abc/.test('abc')
[00:19] tbranyen: yeah i can agree with that
[00:19] craigcondon has joined the channel
[00:19] MooGoo: .exec
[00:19] ryah: no functionality is lost
[00:19] MooGoo: I really dont care about the regex thing
[00:20] MooGoo: it was useful for code golf tho
[00:20] MooGoo: and why is yield bad for JS
[00:20] tim_smart: ryah: There are times when details are important though - like when trying to make your code run faster.
[00:20] MooGoo: I would think some kind of corotuine support would be extremly useful
[00:21] tim_smart: MooGoo: :(
[00:21] ryah: MooGoo: good thing no one asked you :)
[00:22] tim_smart: MooGoo: Someone has already done that
[00:22] ryah: simplicity comes from simplicity not from complexity

[00:22] MooGoo: fibers?
[00:22] eigentone has joined the channel
[00:22] towski has joined the channel
[00:23] monokrome: simplicity comes from abstracting complex problems :)
[00:23] MooGoo: ryah: as simple as possible and no simpler
[00:23] SubStack: yield sucks because it's not a thing
[00:23] SubStack: functions are things
[00:23] SubStack: you can do whatever with them
[00:23] SubStack: yield is a language keyword
[00:23] MooGoo: JS has statements unfortunatly
[00:24] SubStack: having to think about 2 separate types of functions sucks
[00:24] MooGoo: it's an imperfect language to begin with
[00:24] SubStack: ruby has like 3 types
[00:24] MooGoo: yea that is stupid
[00:24] SubStack: python has even more
[00:24] ryah: stealing this quote from rust
[00:24] MooGoo: I dont like rubys subtle differences between blocks procks lambdas etc
[00:24] monokrome: Ruby is also Ruby. That is a problem.
[00:24] MooGoo: procs
[00:24] SubStack: I like how javascript doesn't have classes too, just more functions
[00:24] tim_smart: SubStack: They are trying to change that
[00:25] hij1nx has joined the channel
[00:25] MooGoo: yup
[00:25] MooGoo: and we wouldnt even need a `new` keyword if JS had __proto__ from the begining
[00:25] tim_smart: SubStack: IMO they are making a mistake
[00:25] mscdex: i think i remember seeing that regexp change awhile back
[00:25] MooGoo: JS just needs a sane prototype implementation
[00:26] tim_smart: MooGoo: new is great, most 'classes' have constructors anyway
[00:26] MooGoo: well...I just upgraded node today
[00:26] insin: They checked that Mozilla removed support first: http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=617
[00:26] mscdex: well, i mean i saw it in the changelog :)
[00:26] MooGoo: tim_smart: but it is unesecary
[00:26] tim_smart: MooGoo: I guess
[00:27] kriszyp has joined the channel
[00:27] MooGoo: especily when you have __proto__
[00:27] tim_smart: ryah: Have you got any benchmark comparisons between non-uv http server and the uv http server?
[00:27] tim_smart: Or isn't http quite there yet?
[00:27] mikeycgto: anyone setup logrotate with a node.js process? i'm redirecting stdout\stderr to a file and need it to be rotated
[00:28] MooGoo: I dont really have a problem with classic OO syntatic sugar in JS as it has had that with `new` from the begining
[00:28] ryah: tim_smart: yes its about 10% slower (the uv one)
[00:28] tim_smart: ryah: Right. I guess that is somewhat expected...
[00:28] konobi: ryah: did you see my mail yesterday?
[00:28] ryah: no - it's not expected. we have to fix it.

[01:04] hlindset has joined the channel
[01:04] monokrome: shanebo: I'd use a NoSQL datastore that isn a bit more robust.
[01:04] shanebo: tim_smart products, which have a category, options, a brand, specs, warranty etc.. The problem is a brand is universally shared and if I edit it, I want it edited across all collections.
[01:04] neoesque has joined the channel
[01:04] hlindset has joined the channel
[01:05] tim_smart: MongoDB has references, so it should be fine.
[01:05] shanebo: tim_smart yeah, I just don't know when to do that
[01:05] shanebo: with references do you have to run multiple queries?
[01:05] reid has joined the channel
[01:06] Cromulent has joined the channel
[01:06] tim_smart: Basically it is just a ObjectId object store in a field.

[01:06] blaenk: anyone here use redis? should I just install it using brew?

[01:07] blaenk: tim_smart: thanks
[01:07] shanebo: tim_smart, okay, well if I embed then how would I do something where on a new product list all the brands, categories etc. that could be chosen? Do I prep that server side?
[01:08] luke` has joined the channel
[01:09] tim_smart: shanebo: Mongo has a thing called collections. So you would have a collection of brands, one for categories, one for products.
[01:09] tim_smart: Mongoose does this all for you btw.
[01:09] tim_smart: Mongoose is a lightweight ORM for mongo.

[01:22] skm has joined the channel
[01:23] iammerrick: shanebo: at the moment, routes in express. It is challenging for me to to write an application that has dozens of routes and abstact them into modules when they need ot be sharing code
[01:23] iammerrick: shanebo: or models, currently I have all models in a models.js file
[01:23] iammerrick: I just feel like I am doing it wrong
[01:23] iammerrick: :-) and was hoping I could get pointed in a better direction
[01:23] shanebo: iammerrick I understand your pain :D
[01:23] iammerrick: shanebo: :D
[01:23] shanebo: I think it's more due to there being no globals
[01:24] shanebo: so when you require a file it's not universally in scope
[01:24] skm has joined the channel
[01:24] iammerrick: shanebo: sure, so its normal to require('mycontroller).user(app)

[01:28] iammerrick: shanebo: ok thank you :)
[01:29] shanebo: iammerrick I've heard other guys say they have individual files that they require which require a bunch in one to keep it simpler
[01:29] iammerrick: shanebo: interesting. so require('controllers')
[01:29] iammerrick: which in turn has a bunch of exports.Controller
[01:30] iammerrick: exports.Controller2 kinda stuff?
[01:30] shanebo: i think so
[01:30] shanebo: however my controllers are required at runtime depending on route
[01:30] shanebo: but I will run into that problem with my models
[01:30] shanebo: i'm using mongoose and still trying to discern the docs (they're really weak)

[01:46] shanebo: can you explain why you guys discourage globals so much? As long as I'm careful why is this a bad idea?
[01:46] jellosea: does anyone know how to add the prototype of one object to another? so not replace, but add
[01:46] bnoordhuis: shanebo: globals in what sense?
[01:47] shanebo: bnoordhuis for example, req/res, rather than pass these as args all over the place, why not set them as a global?

[06:15] jerrysv: how hard is it to transfer ownership to them in npm?

[06:15] kdng-tr71 has joined the channel
[06:15] jerrysv: and that could completely remove me?
[06:15] isaacs: (that is, "not very")
[06:16] isaacs: no, for that, you'd do: npm owner rm my-username packagename
[06:16] jerrysv: ok. tj has his node-coverage stuff, and keeps not releasing it
[06:16] jerrysv: i want to release it, but give him the option to take it over
[06:16] jerrysv: so, thanks, that works nicely :)
[06:17] jerrysv: ACTION *hearts* npm
[06:17] isaacs: jerrysv: there's a bit of a security issue there, which i'm cleaning up soon
[06:17] jerrysv: so, soon easy to deal with?
[06:17] isaacs: jerrysv: namely, i can publish garbage, change the ownership to you, remove mysefl, and everyone will be like, "Hey, I know jerrysv! I'll totally trust this thing, and run it!!")
[06:18] jerrysv: understoon
[06:18] jerrysv: er, understood
[06:18] isaacs: so, what i'm probably going to do is keep you around as the "effective owner", until the other person actually pushes something.
[06:18] mscdex: ok, success on 0.5.2 now, i made a silly mistake :>
[06:18] jerrysv: it's been 7 months, and still no release, but i really want to give him the option to own the repository if he wants
[06:18] isaacs: sure
[06:18] jerrysv: understood
[06:18] kartmetal: similarly, are there any provisions to rescue abandoned npm packages?
[06:18] jerrysv: and the effective ownership sounds good to me
[06:19] jerrysv: trying not to step on anyones toes, but after 7 months, and now vowsjs working with it, it's kind of important that it become easier to use
[06:19] isaacs: kartmetal: email the author, if that doesn't work in a few weeks, let me know, and we'll figure it out.
[06:19] isaacs: kartmetal: that's pretty rare, and usually easy to deal with like human beings.
[06:19] kartmetal: isaacs, cool.
[06:20] kartmetal: yeah. I don't actually have an immediate use case for it.
[06:20] isaacs: jerrysv: i think he may be holding off to replace it with something that doens't require compilation
[06:20] kartmetal: although ndns' somewhat limbo-esque state makes me sad given its potential.
[06:20] jerrysv: isaacs: i saw that in the issue, but it's been 7 months, expresso isn't 0.5+ compliant, and there appears to have been no progress

[08:27] harthur has joined the channel
[08:28] KimSchneider: Expressjs seems to have a limit of 5 open connections per IP. This could be due to http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/http.html#agent.maxSockets Is there any way we can affect this behaviour? As we use a nodejs proxy and every request has the same IP, we need more than just 5 simultaneous requests per IP.

[10:25] mscdex: shanebo: here it is, there's a separate module someone made for it: https://github.com/baudehlo/node-fs-ext , although it forces you to manually use fs.open/write/close because it needs the fd

[10:25] Ineentho: I am trying to create a web app using socket.io, would you recommend me to stay on an apache server and use node for only some things, or would you recommend me to ues node as webserver too?

[15:36] TheJH: cryptic, I don't know your usecase, maybe greasemonkey would be better?
[15:36] cryptic: in my domain, there are about four web sites that do precisely the same thing, but in different subsets. oftentimes, conducting a search requires familiarity with these sites & logging in to each one to perform the search
[15:36] cryptic: tmcw: it's essentially scraping
[15:36] cryptic: TheJH: nah, I've been using QtWebKit for this already, but the performance is so-so

[15:38] Swizec has joined the channel
[15:38] cryptic: tmcw: mostly overhead
[15:38] cryptic: I didn't write the code; someone else did, and there are memory leaks everywhere

[15:46] cryptic: TheJH: I suppose I could. This is just a "lazy" way of getting around that, when they invariably change the sites (as they do almost weekly)
[15:46] TheJH: cryptic, also the XHR apis?
[15:48] cryptic: TheJH: the sites don't use good technique at all. they send your username/password to a random page, you get a 301 redirect to another page that only contains a window.location=... script (to make sure you have js enabled), etc.
[15:48] pandeiro has joined the channel

[16:03] eignerchris has joined the channel
[16:03] jerrysv: tjholowaychuk: i realize that, but it's not quite there, and node-jscoverage is a pretty decent stopgap
[16:03] tjholowaychuk: i think test frameworks can be ignorant to test cov and still support it

[17:01] edude03: So my problem is this right, so on socket connect, add the user to the list of online users (using redis lets say), but then I need to assign them some sort of id
[17:02] edude03: Or something, so that if bob wants to send alice a message it knows which connection 'alice' is so we can deliver her a message

[17:07] edude03: then bob wants to send alice a message, so we can search redis for a user named alice, get her id

[17:09] brainproxy: edude03: you'll probably need to keep an array or hash of socket objects

[17:11] junkee[] has joined the channel
[17:11] edude03: DevX101: assuming the users are stored in a database you could just read that database

[17:54] cconstantine: I just installed node/npm and when I do npm install <blah> or sudo npm install <blah> all it appears to do is make a node_modules directory of that <blah> package.  No dependences and I can't 'require' anything
[17:55] jesusabdullah: cconstantine: What about node_modules/blah/node_modules ?

[18:32] TheJH: isaacs, but if you're used to downloading git repos and blindly running configure;make;sudo make install, it isn't that scary
[18:32] isaacs: TheJH, chjj: yeah, there's always a web of trust
[18:33] isaacs: TheJH: it's pretty easy forone person to turn evil.  but a lot of people watch the npm commits, and are at least somewhat familiar with its internals.

[20:11] TheJH: cl0udy, I think that it needs to be done that complicated
[20:11] cl0udy: so what the author did was to hold res.writeHead with writeHead
[20:11] cl0udy: and later passing it back to res.writeHead?
[20:11] tjholowaychuk: cl0udy that's how you inject logic into existing methods

[20:21] tjholowaychuk: cl0udy i didnt really look at it

[20:22] xerox: bingomanatee1: hmm normal, the maximum steep direction?

[20:27] explodes has joined the channel
[20:27] tjholowaychuk: cl0udy if the function has a receiver "this" is that object, otherwise it's the global

[20:27] bingomanatee1: in foo.bar() this is foo. 
[20:27] tjholowaychuk: cl0udy foo.bar() "this" == foo, bar() "this" == global
[20:27] xerox: bingomanatee1: since your data is discrete you're going to need to do some interpolation I guess?

[21:58] bnoordhuis: vim + ctags does a better job sometimes
[21:58] zeiris has joined the channel
[21:58] der|: having auto completion and/or documentation for netbeans, would be a matter of creating some stub files with empty functions, just to store parameter/function data
[21:59] mscdex: der|: notepad++ on windows, gedit on linux or nano with js syntax highlighting for quick console edits
[21:59] AvianFlu: I use sublime text 2, but I should add that I hate code completion and never want it in my life
[21:59] AvianFlu: so you might want different things than I do :-P

[22:00] sirdancealot has joined the channel
[22:00] der|: mscdex: I'm looking for something more robust actually. I'm using Textmate for now (on mac). But I think the script might work to create support for node on Netbeans

[22:00] johnhamelink: Is it possible to have auto completion in vim/macvim/gvim?
[22:00] der|: mscdex: Yup, just thought about that heh
[22:00] mscdex: auto completion is overrated
[22:00] mscdex: use node long enough and you memorize the api
[22:00] der|: well, I don't actually use auto completion, sometimes I just want to see which functions do I have available, and their docs
[22:00] mscdex: ;-)
[22:01] der|: heh, as a matter of fact, I hate auto completion...

[22:33] shanebo: anyone here familiar with writeFile and if it locks or not?
[22:33] johnhamelink: kevindente: it does, I'm using outlook right now, but I'm going to check out Mac mail because outlook is... bloated to say the least (but much better than the windows version)
