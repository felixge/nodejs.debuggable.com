[00:30] karlbright_: but you could possibly just add to an array of events and setup listeners based on them?

[00:47] acuster: Hey all,
[00:48] acuster: question re. node command line REPL
[00:48] acuster: I realize that the repl system evaluates the last evaluated element (which it shows)
[00:49] acuster: but I am trying to grok what exactly is happening
[00:49] acuster: it seems to pretty print some objects and not others 
[00:49] acuster: and I do not understand exactly what is going on
[00:49] konobi: RTFS?
[00:49] konobi: =0P
[00:49] acuster: is node calling a particular function?
[00:50] acuster: in R, the REPL calls the .print() method, is node doing something similar?

[06:01] jesusabdullah: every bit of what code?
[06:01] trevogre: The code I'm using :). 
[06:01] trevogre: createClient
[06:01] jesusabdullah: what retooling?
[06:02] trevogre: I'm connecting to twitter with twitter-node which uses createClient.
[06:02] jesusabdullah: http://docs.nodejitsu.com/articles/HTTP/servers/how-to-create-a-HTTPS-server
[06:02] trevogre: but twitter just went to only https.
[06:02] jesusabdullah: it'll be an easy change to make, don't worry
[06:02] trevogre: Ok.
[06:02] Nexxy has left the channel
[06:02] jesusabdullah: I thought maybe you wanted to know how to upgrade an http connection into an https one
[06:03] jesusabdullah: that looks hard
[06:03] trevogre: I set the 3rd Arguement to true.
[06:03] trevogre: in createClient.. but that didn't seem to do it.
[06:03] ticean_ has joined the channel
[06:03] trevogre: I'm not actually trying to create a server. I'm trying to make a client connection.
[06:04] trevogre: Which is easy with curl.

[06:04] socialhack has joined the channel
[06:04] trevogre: just add https.. but with createClient its not working so well.

[06:05] jesusabdullah: that, maybe?
[06:06] huskyr has joined the channel
[06:07] trevogre: yeah, I saw something like that, but I was wishing it was just a different set of switches for createClient.
[06:07] trevogre: instead of a different library. 
[06:07] trevogre: not impressed! :)
[06:08] jesusabdullah: Here's the weird thing, though
[06:08] jesusabdullah: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.12/api/http.html
[06:08] jesusabdullah: Is createClient in here?
[06:08] jesusabdullah: I was looking for it earlier
[06:09] jesusabdullah: I can't find it
[06:09] trevogre: yeah. wierd.
[06:09] jesusabdullah: Perhaps deprecated?
[06:10] zmbmartin has joined the channel
[06:10] trevogre: maybe.. I wonder. with that https get stay open, because I need a socket for it to continually stream to. 
[06:11] Bonuspunkt: http.createClient = v0.2
[06:11] trevogre: So what is the new hotness?
[06:12] trevogre: ServerRequest?
[06:12] trevogre: ClientRequest?
[06:12] Bonuspunkt: afaik http.get / http.request
[06:12] trevogre: or https.get ... 
[06:12] trevogre: ok.

[08:56] abraxas: any IPCBuffer fans around?

[08:57] jetienne_ has joined the channel
[08:57] guidocalvano has joined the channel
[08:57] dexter_e: npm list on both local and remote is identical
[08:57] abraxas: when a developer comes to me with that question, my first suggestion is: strace it, see what it's trying to access
[08:58] abraxas: you know how strace works?
[08:58] socialhack has joined the channel
[09:00] dexter_e: nope
[09:00] dexter_e: whats strace ?
[09:00] rendar has joined the channel
[09:00] dexter_e: never used strace 
[09:00] abraxas: a command line tool to trace what kind of system calls your application is firing
[09:00] abraxas: if you normally run your node app like:  node myapp.js   try running it with:  strace node myapp.js
[09:00] dexter_e: whoa sweet!
[09:01] abraxas: you'll see a lot of "file not found" which are very innocent, because node's require-logic makes it go through a lot of paths to find your modules
[09:01] abraxas: but you should also find the culprit in your problem
[09:01] dexter_e: abraxas: Thanks I'm doing it now..  I'm guessing I gotta apt-get install strace first 
[09:01] abraxas: possible yeah, good luck
[09:02] dexter_e: ok I just ran it through strace and it looks like I'm falling through the matrix bro
[09:02] dexter_e: I can dig that
[09:02] nforgerit has joined the channel
[09:03] abraxas: heheh
[09:03] dexter_e: whoa apparently node needs:  gettimeofday   like 121 times as well
[09:03] abraxas: ideally, your application dies because of your error… in which case it should be the last thing you see in the output of strace
[09:03] abraxas: right
[09:04] abraxas: i actually use the clock heavily in the system i'm working on right now, but only to second precision. so i made my own, in order to minimize those system calls to once per second max.
[09:04] abraxas: maybe i should make a nice simple module for that and publish it.
[09:04] abraxas: (it's really tiny tho)
[09:04] bencc has joined the channel
[09:05] dexter_e: that would be sweet
[09:05] dexter_e: so am I looking for the last open("")  call in strace?
[09:06] dexter_e: or a  stat("") would do it too ?
[09:06] dexter_e: the app does crash and there is an ERRO no file found in there
[09:06] dexter_e: but its after a stat() call
[09:06] Lingerance: There you go
[09:07] abraxas: stat() is probably used to check if the file exists, or get other meta data about the file
[09:07] abraxas: so that's it
[09:07] abraxas: that path is not found, and is making your stuff break
[09:08] luke` has joined the channel
[09:12] dexter_e: actually all the files are there
[09:12] dexter_e: those stat calls appear to be testing for file with and without the .js extension
[09:12] dexter_e: and finding on each second attempt with .js on it

[11:52] bencc has joined the channel
[11:53] tuhoojabotti: Well
[11:53] tuhoojabotti: It returns the function reference
[11:53] tuhoojabotti: And I guess it executes it once you try to use it.
[11:53] tuhoojabotti: or something.
[11:53] tuhoojabotti: Dunno lol.
[11:53] tuhoojabotti: What I don't get is why are you returning a value in an anonymous function
[11:54] navaru: so you don't get it either :))
[11:54] tuhoojabotti: I think you are talking about a different thing.
[11:54] DrMcKay: in here it's useless
[11:54] DrMcKay: but useful when you want do, say: return next(err);

[11:56] navaru: DrMcKay: thanks, I've seen a lot of modules written in that style, and I thought I was missing something

[12:41] dexter_e: well console.log seems to go to /var/log
[12:41] bzinger has joined the channel
[12:41] dexter_e: and I can't see anything in /dev/stderr   so I though maybe it was redirecting it somehow

[12:42] DrMcKay: you shouldn't
[12:42] dmkbot has joined the channel

[12:43] dexter_e: all my console.log messages are visible in /var/log/node.log

[12:44] DrMcKay: dexter_e: node wasn't meant to be secure
[12:44] dexter_e: hmm
[12:44] DrMcKay: are you trying to set up a http server?
[12:44] dexter_e: Well it was kind of a time saver when putting it on port 80
[12:44] dexter_e: yeah 
[12:44] dexter_e: http server
[12:44] DrMcKay: dexter_e: use iptables to forward from port 80 to, say, 8000
[12:44] slickplaid: reverse proxy to 80 or tunnel it's port to 80 using the firewall
[12:45] slickplaid: s/tunnel/forward/ :D
[12:45] DrMcKay: or reverse proxy, like nginx or node-http-proxy 
[12:45] slickplaid: regardless, i don't think a generic node process logs to /var/log/node.log
[12:45] dexter_e: yeah I planned to do that later 
[12:45] slickplaid: what modules are you running? and who's code?
[12:45] dexter_e: for now I just wanted to do some basic proof of concept stuff with node with shortest path from A to B

[12:48] Glenjamin: by locally
[12:48] DrMcKay: hotch: it could've been some race condition
[12:48] dexter_e: It fails silently when running with upstart
[12:48] DrMcKay: hotch: show me the codez
[12:48] hotch: yeah
[12:48] hotch: work they'll castrate me :P
[12:49] hotch: also, i bumped the v on short and make it short.gen vs. short.make
[12:49] DrMcKay: lol
[12:49] hotch: oh that actually might have been an issue too, not sure?
[12:49] hotch: i wasn't taking chances i was done playing operating system difference games =-]
[12:49] Glenjamin: you have to make sure that if you need to reference anything in a function, the function is being run *after* the inititalisation code
[12:49] Glenjamin: which requires a clear callback chain
[12:50] Glenjamin: once you get used to it, its fine - but it does tend to trip everyone up at first
[12:50] hotch: yah
[12:51] dexter_e: Anyone got a pointer on where to look for start up errors other than /var/log/node.log  ?
[12:52] hotch: dexter_e: just run with node first -
[12:52] Aphelion has joined the channel
[12:52] dexter_e: I did that 
[12:52] dexter_e: it works find with node
[12:52] Glenjamin: dexter_e: i'd assume it's related to working directory or environment variables
[12:53] Glenjamin: try adding console.warn(process.env.NODE_PATH) to the top of your script
[12:53] bencc has joined the channel
[12:53] dexter_e: ok
[12:54] dexter_e: you think the path might be different when runnign with Upstart?

[12:58] dexter_e: process.env.NODE_PATH is undefined in every combination
[12:58] erichynds has joined the channel
[12:58] Glenjamin: probably not that then :)
[12:58] dexter_e: should it be defined ?

[12:58] Glenjamin: not necessarily
[12:58] skyl has joined the channel

[12:59] anveo has joined the channel
[12:59] Glenjamin: then, try console.log(process.env) and then diff the output
[12:59] dexter_e: its just when I start it as a daemon it seems to drop connections 
[12:59] Glenjamin: upstart is running as a differnt uid to normal perhaps?
[13:00] dexter_e: I tink Upstart runs as www-user
[13:00] dexter_e: or root

[13:58] baudehlo: Not exactly.
[13:59] Glenjamin: it's working like a closure :)
[13:59] baudehlo: It's a result of there being no lexical variables. That "var i" in your for loop is defined at the global level.
[13:59] wankdanker: or lack there of

[15:19] matjas: Glenjamin: “main” says: “The main field is a module ID that is the primary entry point to your program. That is, if your package is named foo, and a user installs it, and then does require("foo"), then your main module's exports object will be returned.”

[15:36] CoverSlide: whatever script you're using it in, just npm install locally
[15:36] Glenjamin: CoverSlide: I get the reason for making it immutabel, but i dont get why we can't read it anymore. Is there a different way for us to find out what load paths are in effecT?
[15:36] mehtryx: there is good reason for some things to have global installs….mind elaborating on the reason not too?
[15:37] CoverSlide: well if you are installing multiple packages, the authors may not all be using the same version of a single package
[15:38] patrickgamer has joined the channel
[15:38] CoverSlide: so they can't exactly all agree on which version of the package to use, one version might crash one person's package
[15:39] mehtryx: sure, but and I may be wrong…doesn't local installed package take precedence over global in the paths anyway?
[15:39] mehtryx: So in that case where you need something "different" you locally install it.
[15:39] CoverSlide: yeah
[15:39] mpavel has left the channel
[15:39] mehtryx: for me the global allows applications that have an executable component to scaffold 
[15:39] patrickgamer has left the channel
[15:39] CoverSlide: but i think isaacs felt it was bad practice
[15:39] mehtryx: not having that global means mucking up path statments…to point to the executable
[15:40] CoverSlide: oh the global install is fine for executables, in fact that's one of the reasons the -g flag exists
[15:40] CoverSlide: but you can't require()

[17:32] Aikar: i improved the system over the years as need seen fit. the mechwarz server really stressed the first basic imp, which made me implement proper stream_select workings to make it semi async.

[17:52] DrMcKay: lol
[17:53] Aikar: http://github.com/aikar/nodeib i've already started project to rewrite a new IRC bot framework to replace the PHP one. I decided to write my own cause I have lots of neat ideas and plans I wanted to do for the PHP one that id rather design out fully on my own instead of trying to branch/push into someone elses bot
[17:54] Aikar: and im toying with various new stuff to design with.
[17:54] Aikar: ie using Joose to have a rich OOP system for writing code in
[17:54] Aikar: nodeib/lib/NodeIB
[17:55] Aikar: I just updated my Traceur module to act as a compiler instead of a runtime translator, cause runtime = way too slow for production.
[17:55] Aikar: then going to work in Streamline too, so have a rich OOP system with the new syntax features Traceur provides and able to write the code in a sync style. = seems fun to me

[18:02] Aikar: someone ddosing your services box = services dies a bad death

[18:02] CoverSlide: oh i've played with ircd.js
[18:02] levi: PSYC is an interesting look at making an improvement on the IRC protocol itself, while retaining some compatibility with IRC and XMPP.
[18:02] context: aikar: and no one should know where your services are hosted
[18:03] Aikar: context: gotta move ahead and ditch old ways of thinking. there really isnt a need to have it seperate :P
[18:03] context: or where they are linked to
[18:03] CoverSlide: it's fun, irssi works with it ok, but missing a lot
[18:03] context: aikar: although, i could understand a sort of 'fallback' where all the other servers are running services as well just not active, when the one goes down, another takes over
[18:03] CoverSlide: not a fan of xmpp
[18:04] context: xmpp is a little too complicated for its own good i think
[18:04] levi: Neither are the PSYC guys.
[18:04] context: and the irc protocol is a little too restrictive
[18:04] context: SILC !
[18:04] Aikar: context: or just have the services commands implemented as custom IRc commands themselves. and w/e network the person who issued it on handles processing it and DOESNT forward it to the other servers (or maybe forwards it in a log-only type approach)
[18:04] CoverSlide: i'd much prefer {z,aq,sto}mp
[18:05] Aikar: context: xmpp is xml, of course its too complicated :P
[18:05] swaj: Aikar: I'd just make the commands local and use a mongodb shard on all leaf servers that stays in sync with the rest of them.  Then the leaf servers just interact with their local mongo instances :P

[18:11] krazyjakee: http://smokeos.com/mystalia/
[18:12] swaj: silc runs on a low port.... that's odd
[18:13] Aikar: swaj: storage race conditions isnt what i meant. i meant the fact that the nature of an IRC linked network is that a server replicates commands it receives to all servers in the network. so a register command would BY STANDARD BEHAVIOR would be forwarded to ALL servers. which would all trigger a register action which isnt desired. so youd need special processing to only the local server of the user PROCESSES the command, but forwards it in a "log that this perso
[18:13] darinc: krazyjakee:,  "Connecting to server... Failed"

[18:22] krazyjakee: i probably copy and pasted some tutorial code that requires it
[18:22] Aikar: https://github.com/aikar/nodeib/blob/master/lib/NodeIB/Module/Process.js
[18:22] Aikar: like that
[18:22] swaj: joose seems a little silly to me.

[18:23] Aikar: swaj: 'silly' ?
[18:23] vidi has joined the channel
[18:23] swaj: aye, the JS type system works fine for me.  I don't see a need to create a JSON abstraction to do what JS already does.
[18:24] Aikar: its not as simple and clean as say the upcoming class syntax in harmony/strawman w/e the hell it is, 
[18:24] Aikar: cause its cleaner to implement
[18:24] swaj: you save a little typing, but it's just another dependency that could break a *lot* of stuff
[18:25] Aikar: can save ALOT of typing lol
[18:25] krazyjakee: I do not understand the access-control-allow-origin... I've set it in the headers, what more does chrome want?!?
[18:25] krazyjakee: var server = http.createServer(function(req, res){   res.writeHead(200,{ 'Content-Type': 'text/html', 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' : '*' });
[18:27] Aikar: Class('Foo', {isa: Bar}, methods: { initialize: function() { this.SUPER(42); }  }); is alot simpler than the plain way of doing it w/o a helper lib.
[18:27] Shrink has joined the channel
[18:27] swaj: meh, I'd rather stick to standard JS :P  It's the same reason I don't use coffee-script
[18:28] Aikar: it still is JS :P its just JS functions that save you time lol
[18:28] Shrink has left the channel
[18:28] swaj: yes, it's still standard JS, a method call, yadda yadda yadda
[18:28] swaj: I knew that argument was coming :P
[18:28] augustl: it's perfectly possible to program without classes ;)
[18:28] CoverSlide: what? no
[18:28] tjholowaychuk: who types "function"
[18:28] Aikar: "classes" in joose is still the same prototypal inheritance we all know and love, just a different "format" of creating them
[18:28] tjholowaychuk: that's what editors are for
[18:28] CoverSlide: Classes were invented before there was programming
[18:29] augustl: Aikar: not really, this.SUPER? :S
[18:29] CoverSlide: it's impossible
[18:29] alekhine has joined the channel
[18:29] augustl: CoverSlide: see: C
[18:29] Aikar: is a shorthand for Bar.apply(this, arguments)

[18:29] CoverSlide: augustl: see sarcasm
[18:29] augustl: Aikar: which you typially don't do when you don't have a class abstraction
[18:29] swaj: changing*
[18:30] augustl: Aikar: my only point being, still, that it's entirely possible to program without classes
[18:30] socialhack has joined the channel
[18:30] Aikar: never said it wasnt, but it can really help organize and improve unit testing with it
[18:30] luxigo_ has joined the channel
[18:31] augustl: Aikar: you're saying that like it's hard to organize and unit test without classes
[18:31] darinc: krazyjakee:  I'm not certain about this but it looks like on the server you are answering ANY port 8080 request with "Hello Socket Lover".
[18:31] augustl: Aikar: which I don't think is the case. And not sure if that's what you meant.
[18:31] Aikar: augustl: no but it is more effort
[18:31] darinc: I put up a gist from a node chat server example:  here  https://gist.github.com/1254584
[18:31] augustl: Aikar: I disagree.

[18:32] darinc: krazyjakee:  notice it uses express, so it's not a 1 to 1 comparison
[18:32] augustl: Aikar: if you prefer to think in classes, it is more effort.
[18:32] swaj: meh, just create classes as functions and modify the prototype
[18:32] AlekaOvidiu has joined the channel
[18:32] augustl: Aikar: but some people don't think in classes.
[18:32] augustl: both ways are just fine
[18:32] augustl: just sayin'
[18:32] Aikar: well i do PHP for a day job... so writing classes and mocking instances of them is my day to day job, so im use to it lol
[18:32] augustl: Aikar: exactly
[18:33] augustl: if that's your thing, a class thingie for JS is probably very helpful
[18:33] krazyjakee: darinc: Thanks, this was working code in march. I don't think that is a reason that socket.io would be having access issues
[18:33] augustl: Aikar: you can still mock without classes though. Etc etc etc.
[18:34] Aikar: augustl: got an example of doing phpunit like mocking in node?
[18:34] swaj: yeah I do .NET by day, so I'm definitely very heavy OOP mainly, but I just don't see the need for an abstraction.  To me, plain JS works fine :)
[18:34] Aikar: thats something im still needing to get down
[18:34] augustl: Aikar: not sure what phpunit does. But you'll love http://sinonjs.org/
[18:34] Aikar: like $oInstance->expects(self::once())->method('foo')->with(42,1)->will(self::returnValue(100));
[18:34] airhorns has joined the channel
[18:34] AlekaOvidiu: Hello, who can help me to install NodeJS on windows via Cygwin? i got some errors and I can't find the answers for them on google.
[18:35] augustl: Aikar: you don't do mocking and assertions in one go with sinon
[18:35] Aikar: that says 'method foo on the instance of $oInstance SHOULD be called once, and with 42,1 as its args, and stuff that called it wil lget 100 as return'
[18:35] Aikar: and if it doesnt meet those expectations, fail
[18:35] CoverSlide: AlekaOvidiu: some versions don't build on Cygwin
[18:35] augustl: Aikar: you do i.e. sinon.stub(myObj, "foo").returns(100); myObj.foo(); assert(myObj.foo.calledOnce);
[18:35] CoverSlide: Cygwin isn't really officially supported
[18:35] JasonJS: Aikar: Have you looked at nodeunit or vows?
[18:35] augustl: Aikar: ya, sinon works like that, but it doesn't implement failing/asserting
[18:36] augustl: Aikar: Jasmin uses sinon for its mocking and stubbing afaik
[18:36] Aikar: JasonJS: vows yes i use but i dont see mocking
[18:36] augustl: it's easy to integrate sinon into any mocking framework. You should poke them about it :)
[18:36] augustl: err, any testing framework*
[18:36] Aikar: ar mock = sinon.mock(myAPI); mock.expects("method").once();
[18:36] Aikar: looks like they do support phpunit like assertions

[18:37] saschagehlich has joined the channel
[18:37] augustl: Aikar: it throws an exception if expectations were not met
[18:38] augustl: remember to do proper setup/teardown if you use sinon, or you're in trouble ;)
[18:38] Aikar: so it needs argument call expectations, or maybe it has em
[18:38] augustl: Aikar: assert(myMock.calledWith(1, 2))
[18:38] augustl: or calledWithExactly
[18:38] augustl: and calledOnce
[18:38] augustl: etc
[18:38] augustl: needs to be asserted separately iirc
[18:38] augustl: Aikar: nvm me :)
[18:38] augustl: Aikar: http://sinonjs.org/docs/#expectations
[18:39] Aikar: well if use it with joose, can create classes that inherit from the class your testing so it wont ACTUALLY overload it. i bet can come up with a simple wrapper
[18:39] augustl: you can add expectations for all that stuff apparently
[18:39] Aikar: nice
[18:39] augustl: Aikar: it actually overloads it. but it has a "teardown" method or something that resets it
[18:39] augustl: Aikar: see http://sinonjs.org/docs/#sandbox
[18:40] Aikar: just clicked that
[18:40] Aikar: damnit, now another new technology to learn before i can actually write some damn code ._.

[18:45] swaj: Aikar: seems like you just don't like writing javascript :P
[18:45] swaj: Aikar: joose, traceur, streamline, what else you gonna toss in there? :P
[18:45] Aikar: swaj: I do, but i'm looking to play with newer things :P
[18:46] Aikar: and make development 'easier'
[18:46] swaj: make development more PHP-like it sounds :P
[18:46] Aikar: spend less time on common problems of async
[18:46] Aikar: and more on the problem at large
[18:46] MooGoo: just write your irc bot to support modules/plugins in a variaty of wacky languages
[18:46] swaj: async is just a mental adjustment :)
[18:47] CoverSlide: async really isn't all that hard
[18:47] swaj: I agree
[18:47] swaj: but some people really don't "grok" functional programming
[18:47] Aikar: which im adjusted to, just, for example this in streamline  is a pain the ass in normal async code: var result = foo(bar(_), baz(_) + blah(_));
[18:47] MooGoo: async != functional
[18:47] MooGoo: but yea
[18:47] MooGoo: its not that bad
[18:47] swaj: no, but the two often go hand-in-hand :)
[18:48] swaj: in C# it's basically the same thing
[18:48] levi: I do async programming in C all the time, in a very not-functional manner.
[18:48] swaj: could you even do functional programming in C?
[18:48] MooGoo: of course
[18:48] swaj: I'd hate to see what that looks like
[18:48] paul0 has joined the channel
[18:48] MooGoo: its just not natural

[18:49] tjholowaychuk: async in c is great, you have to keep things flat

[18:49] levi: Fighting C is generally a bad idea.  It will win, in the end.
[18:49] CoverSlide: ACTION looks for the ASYNC x86 command
[18:49] swaj: I try to embrace the things JavaScript is good at instead of trying to transform it into another language or paradigm.
[18:49] augustl: when you solve hard problems, the language/syntax etc matters less. When you write run of the mill rails apps and irc bots, it matters more. Just my 1 cent
[18:49] swaj: yeah
[18:49] Aikar: cant give us 2 cents? :P
[18:50] DrMcKay: CoverSlide: haha :D

[18:51] DrMcKay: isaacs: I love it :)
[18:51] isaacs: compilation is a pita
[18:52] DrMcKay: isaacs: true. and fnmatch can't matchBase
[18:52] isaacs: and minimatch is actually pretty fast
[18:52] isaacs: right
[18:52] levi: Some people whose first introduction to asynchronous programming is node.js seem to have some funny ideas about what 'asynchronous programming' means.
[18:52] isaacs: glob.fnmatch is not actually the same code that glob uses.
[18:52] isaacs: it's always weird and different

[18:57] Aikar: swaj: I fully "get" async coding and such with JS, just this article hits the nail in the head: http://bjouhier.wordpress.com/2011/01/09/asynchronous-javascript-the-tale-of-harry/   - some tasks in async are way more complicated than they are in sync style applications. and these problems are solvable by the computer. so thats a main reason im looking at using streamline. not that I dont understand async, its that I understand the extra effort you have to do to 
[18:57] DrMcKay: isaacs: also, I'll write something with single file and array of patterns

[21:17] tprice: does anyone know of a routing protocol for something like socket.io or raw tcp connection
[21:17] tyler-iphone: jerrysv  ⬅  why is bricks.appserver lowercase?

[21:20] tprice: so the data would hop from server to server
[21:20] tyler-iphone: jerrysv  ⬅  is it express compatible or designed to be whole different system?
[21:20] tprice: like routing
[21:20] devaholic: oh, so you want like some dnode with pub/sub then
[21:20] dokmatik has joined the channel

[21:22] devaholic: since you probably dont know which other node to send to, pubsub is probably easiest
[21:23] tprice: im looking more for a standard as i have written the "dnode" part but want some sort of routing
[21:23] tprice: im looking for something that can hop 6 or 7 times
[21:23] tprice: and the rount is not direct

[21:23] JasonJS: tprice: How do the server connect together? Is there always a parent-child relationship that is known?

[21:24] jerrysv: tyler-iphone: heh, check out: https://github.com/JerrySievert/bricks-analytics
[21:24] tprice: slaves connecto so masters only
[21:25] tprice: its all going over tcp
[21:25] jerrysv: which even instruments the route execution, adds its own routes, and uses an event listener to gather the data
[21:25] chrislorenz has joined the channel
[21:26] devaholic: tprice: sounds complicated
[21:27] JasonJS: tprice: Have you considered using something like socket.io for gluing the servers together? Have the slaves use socket.io-client to connect to their master and then just have a really simple middleware on the master to pass events onto the slaves

[21:28] PuffTheMagic: i've got a question about stream.write(), if I set encoding to ascii but I have a utf8 string will automatically do the conversion or so I have to create my own buffer manually with an ascii encoding and then pass the buffer to the write command?

[21:29] tprice: give me a sec and ill show you what im thnking of
[21:29] tprice: give you an idea of what i mean https://gist.github.com/1255016
[21:29] JasonJS: PuffTheMagic: The ACSII set is the first 255 characters of UTF8 so you should be able to treat any ASCII string as a UTF8 one (but not vis-versa obviously)

[22:07] isaacs: DrMcKay: i'll be merging it in soon
[22:07] isaacs: DrMcKay: i'm bundling msys tar.
[22:07] isaacs: msys basic-bsdtar static compiled, to be specific
[22:07] DrMcKay: I know
[22:08] DrMcKay: so I guess it's only my OCD :P
[22:08] CoverSlide: so msys is the preferred environment for winnode?
[22:08] isaacs: DrMcKay: once this gets stable, i'm strongly considering just not supporting cygwin at all.
[22:08] isaacs: it's too much hassle.
[22:09] isaacs: CoverSlide: no, win32 native.

[22:09] isaacs: CoverSlide: that's why the statically compiled basic-bsdtar.exe, 
[22:09] isaacs: rather than the one that dynamically loads msys dll's
[22:09] DrMcKay: isaacs: but wouldn't node-tar be better than bundling some exe?
[22:09] CoverSlide: gotcha
[22:09] isaacs: DrMcKay: yes!
[22:09] AvianFlu: isaacs: cygwin support is pointless if it runs on windows
[22:09] CoverSlide: what about gzip

[22:10] japj: ACTION is having some git trouble getting the winbin branch locally... it also doesn't help that github is behaving bad atm
[22:10] isaacs: so, i'm doing tar -z right now.  but i'm going to rely on node-core require("zlib") soon.
[22:10] CoverSlide: say that to the porters of python / perl / ruby / tcl to cygwin
[22:10] DrMcKay: isaacs: good :)
[22:10] isaacs: japj: git clone git://github.com/isaacs/npm.git; cd npm; git fetch -a origin; git checkout origin/winbin
[22:10] DrMcKay: (I would feel dirty after checking in an EXE)
[22:10] isaacs: CoverSlide: i think they already know what a hassle it is ;)

[22:20] isaacs: interesting
[22:20] japj: is it first creating a tmp.tgz and then trying to install that?

[22:23] japj: hey I still need to test it to be executing ;)
[22:24] isaacs: can you actually use that vows to do stuff?
[22:24] japj: I was trying to find a module test, but this is also ok:
[22:24] japj: C:\github\tmp>vows
[22:24] japj: The "sys" module is now called "util". It should have a similar interface.

[23:23] isaacs: frenetic: first, i'd recommend using git instead of svn.
[23:23] paul_k has joined the channel
[23:23] isaacs: frenetic: then, do `git add path/to/folder` and it'll add all the files in it
[23:23] japj: isaacs: yeah and I don't think make doc is working on node-0.5.8 on windows yet (atleast I get a socket error during make man3 author)
[23:23] davidbanham has joined the channel
[23:24] isaacs: frenetic: if that's not an option, i think there's some way to do `svn add path/to/folder/*` or something?
[23:24] japj: isaacs: if I start npm without any options it should give help, so without the man pages that is totally broken on windows
[23:24] skyl: yay, CoverSlide, thanks
[23:25] japj: isaacs: oh, and don't try to run npm from the npm git directory, windows will try to run npm.js through the windows script host... sigh
