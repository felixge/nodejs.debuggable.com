[02:50] harthur has joined the channel
[02:50] josephg: nicholasf: for a start, you don't need the parenthases around the app.get function cll
[02:50] josephg: call
[02:50] josephg: - or around client.smembers()
[02:50] nicholasf: josephg: sure, I understand that

[02:51] jacobolu_ has joined the channel
[02:51] josephg: really? ok.
[02:51] nerdy_ has joined the channel
[02:51] nicholasf: but yeh, the resp.send items is obviously occuring before items is populated
[02:51] jacobrask has joined the channel
[02:51] josephg: yeah
[02:52] nicholasf: just trying to work out what to do there
[02:52] josephg: I'm sure there are some async libraries which make that kind of stuff easier… but I just use a little helper method
[02:52] josephg: ACTION finds it
[02:52] nicholasf: thanks
[02:52] rudolfrck has joined the channel
[02:53] nicholasf: like I need to find the fast way to do this (as I'm building a prototype) then I need to work out the best way to do it

[02:53] josephg: This is what I do:
[02:53] josephg: https://github.com/josephg/ShareJS/blob/master/test/helpers/misc.coffee#L39-47
[02:54] nicholasf: ACTION looks
[02:54] josephg: so in your case, you'd say doneOne = expectCalls r.length, -> resp.send items
[02:54] nicholasf: ok fair enough
[02:54] mekwall has joined the channel
[02:54] josephg: then each time you get an item, call doneOne()

[03:03] nicholasf: ACTION looks
[03:03] tonymilne: using step's group code, for a dynamic number of callbacks  
[03:04] nicholasf: ACTION nods
[03:04] tonymilne: so, step bundles up your responses from callbacks
[03:04] tonymilne: and passes them to the next function in line.
[03:04] nicholasf: I think I underestimated how much work practice it would take to switch into node.js' mode of thinking about code
[03:04] nicholasf: ACTION nods
[03:04] nicholasf: yes, that's well put
[03:05] josephg: thats quite clean
[03:05] tonymilne: similarly, if you use this.parallel() it will preserve the order of the calls
[03:05] tonymilne: so you can say foo(this.parrallel()); and bar(this.parallel()); and the next function gets (err, fooResult, barResult)
[03:05] marcello3d has joined the channel
[03:05] nicholasf: ok

[03:36] josephg: marcello3d: yeah, me too actually - though using the ternery operator is nearly 3 times slower on firefox than a function with a ternery operator
[03:36] marcello3d: josephg: I wouldn't optimize for it though. maybe submit bug reports to the browsers
[03:36] marcello3d: Math.min supports more than 2 numbers

[03:47] marcello3d: is it better than box2d?
[03:47] josephg: better and worse...
[03:47] josephg: there's some complicated comparisons floating around online
[03:48] josephg: box2d does collisions properly (so objects can't teleport through each other if they're travelling really fast)
[03:48] josephg: but to make that work, joints are much more complicated. Chipmunk supports way more joints, and is slightly faster
[03:48] r04r has joined the channel
[03:49] marcello3d: ah
[03:49] josephg: box2d also requires that your units are approximately metres (and hence your objects are mostly between 0.1 - 10 units)
[03:49] josephg: I have no idea why...
[03:49] marcello3d: not physics but saw this today, pretty neat: http://evanw.github.com/csg.js/
[03:50] josephg: oh yeah, I saw that
[03:50] marcello3d: the source is pretty clean looking, too
[03:50] josephg: oh, cool.
[03:51] josephg: Its nuts looking at the triangles once they've been merged / split
[03:51] marcello3d: only 600 lines and that includes all the primitive generation
[03:51] marcello3d: yea
[03:51] devongovett has joined the channel
[03:51] josephg: wow - thats tiny. Chipmunk has a data structure thats 800 lines of C.
[03:52] marcello3d: I wonder if those are the optimal tessellations or just a greedy algorithm
[03:52] marcello3d: I feel like some of the shapes could be made more simply
[03:53] amigojapan has joined the channel
[03:53] r04r has joined the channel
[03:54] marcello3d: ok definitely not optimal if you look at the first a.subtract example
[03:54] josephg: yeah I was gonna say.
[03:54] dr0id has joined the channel
[03:54] marcello3d: although
[03:54] josephg: but it might not be a big problem...
[03:54] josephg: and the complicated a.intersect(b).subract(…) down below doesn't look so bad
[03:54] marcello3d: maybe they just wanted all the vertices to line up
[03:55] marcello3d: it looks a little awkward on the red parts
[03:55] josephg: yeah
[03:55] marcello3d: but if you remove the wireframes you wouldn't know
[03:55] josephg: yep. it'd just be a few more polygons than you really need
[03:56] marcello3d: I wonder if it can deal with textures...that'd be an interesting next step
[03:56] josephg: you could write a simplification pass if it became a problem..
[03:56] josephg: yeah I dunno. Probably not
[03:56] marcello3d: that might cause trouble if there's enough precision loss on those tiny triangles
[03:57] josephg: yep. I think triangle removal usually involves a human
[03:57] josephg: I'm not sure how you'd texture it...
[03:58] marcello3d: well assuming the original polygons are UV mapped already
[03:58] josephg: unless you had a way to texture the primitives, then the texture mapping stays on the combined shapes
[03:58] josephg: yeah.
[03:58] marcello3d: you'd just interpolate the UV points when you break it up
[03:58] r04r has joined the channel
[03:58] r04r has joined the channel
[03:58] josephg: yeah, that would be ok.
[03:59] josephg: if you subtracted an object from another object, I think you'd end up painting some of the faces of the original shape with the subtracted shape
[03:59] marcello3d: true
[04:00] marcello3d: but there's no other choice
[04:00] josephg: yeah

[09:43] Nuck: brainproxy: Rut Roh that's common practice o_O

[09:44] Nuck: brainproxy: setTimeout with 0ms

[13:54] josephg: Lingerance: Also, you should never use for-in loops on arrays in normal javascript anyway. They're way slower than normal for loops because they have to scan the whole prototype chain. Check jsperf if you don't believe me.
[13:55] josephg: - just like I learned yesterday that object literals in v8 are 3x slower than objects created using simple constructor functions. (wtf)

[14:38] benvie: way more than 10%
[14:38] benvie: so much async you can fly a plane to yesterday from the Buffer you make tomorrow
[14:39] Aikar: lol
[14:39] benvie: or so much async that you can time travel
[14:39] Aikar: ,_, been a hectic past 2 weeks
[14:40] Aikar: been trying to keep up over email digest, but anything major to be known from past 2 weeks?
[14:40] benvie: 0.6.6 has v8 3.7.12
[14:40] benvie: which is kind of a big deal for some things
[14:41] Aikar: what does that introduce?
[14:41] tuhoojabotti: Link to changelog pl0x
[14:41] tuhoojabotti: :D
[14:41] benvie: the 3.7 branch introduced a completely new garbage collector and a ton of changes behind the scenes related to that
[14:41] tuhoojabotti: Ah that!
[14:41] tuhoojabotti: Cool.
[14:42] benvie: from the JS end the biggest changes are related to the harmony stuff which you can access with the --harmony flag
[14:42] Aikar: hmm wasnt v.6 on 3.6 v8, we did a jump on the stable branch?
[14:42] benvie: that adds the following global objects: Proxy, WeakMap, Map, and Set
[14:42] benvie: well they had already upgraded and then reverted during 0.5
[14:42] benvie: just due to the performance not being there yet
[14:42] Aikar: meh i consider those features unusable (but desired) until they are default on
[14:42] benvie: but it's fine now and there's no big issue otherwise
[14:43] benvie: the GC thing should be impactful
[14:43] benvie: for performance
[14:43] tuhoojabotti: I want it to Chrome
[14:43] tuhoojabotti: for my webgl game :D
[14:43] Aikar: so does it require code updates or just a note performance will improve?
[14:43] benvie: no code updates
[14:43] ashwinp has joined the channel
[14:44] benvie: they wouldn't have, as you mentioned, on the stable branch
[14:44] Aikar: ah k, i havent updated my systems to .6 yet anyways (had family emergency and been out of work for 2 weeks...) but i was gonna be shocked if such a change was made on stable
[14:44] criswell has joined the channel
[14:45] benvie: oh no. And like I said it was going to be in originally but V8 had some issues at the time
[14:45] benvie: like 0.5.10 uses a new V8 than anything up until 0.6.6
[14:45] joshfinnie has joined the channel
[14:45] Aikar: actually now i remember, i believe my app works just fine on .6
[14:45] Aikar: i think i ran it accidently in dev under .6 and it still worked
[14:45] benvie: nothing big in the last two weeks if you weren't relying on that stuff =D
[14:46] Aikar: though ill wait until next week to do solid testing before pushing to prod
[14:46] benvie: it's a big deal if you've needed it
[14:46] Aikar: im still on .4 in prod
[14:47] benvie: the harmony stuff is important for implementing certain things that are otherwise impossible
[14:47] Aikar: thankfully this project at work isnt really hindered by the other teams/prod engineers since it was designed to be a non critical system, so i got pretty much full control on it :P
[14:47] Aikar: yeah id love to have proxies
[14:47] Aikar: but i dont consider them useful until its default on
[14:47] Aikar: cause then you cant use it in modules or youll have cases of people running it w/o --harmony
[14:47] benvie: I take that tact in browsers obviously but less so in Node
[14:47] benvie: since you can basically force it
[14:48] Aikar: how?
[14:48] benvie: by launching a child process using the flag and then switching out basically
[14:48] benvie: if you're launching the module through npm
[14:48] Aikar: yes but as a module you provide to others to use, force reloading their process isnt safe
[14:48] benvie: npm will respect the flags set at the top of the file using hashbang like #! /usr/bin/node --harmony
[14:49] Aikar: say your module foo uses harmony, user does npm install foo, then user does require('foo')
[14:49] Aikar: they dont neccessarily know they need --harmony
[14:49] benvie: yeah you're right
[14:49] benvie: well what i do
[14:49] ashwinp has left the channel
[14:50] benvie: I check for the presence of Proxy and WeakMap in the index file and throw an error so there's no possible way that anything gets done with the module without it
[14:50] benvie: maybe they do it once and get the error
[14:50] ashwinp has joined the channel
[14:50] Aikar: that is possible yeah, but really not desirable, id rather just wait until its default on and not change a users expected use of node
[14:50] benvie: but I specifically state "do exactly this" and it's not a huge change to so do it
[14:50] benvie: yeah I mostly agree
[14:51] benvie: if you don't need it for what you're doing, like if it's a convenience. And it mostly is since it tackles problems in a different way than people are even used to so far
[14:52] benvie: then do it the way that doesn't throw a wrench in it
[14:52] KishCom has joined the channel
[14:52] benvie: the thing I keep seeing though is
[14:52] benvie: even to this day, with modules like "now"
[14:53] criswell has joined the channel
[14:53] benvie: people using require('node-proxy') and not understanding what the actually means
[14:53] benvie: which is a way less desirable result than just throwing an error and telling people to run with the flag
[14:54] louissmit has joined the channel
[14:54] joestein has joined the channel
[14:54] Aikar: node-proxy uses --harmony now?
[14:55] benvie: nono it *doesn't*
[14:55] benvie: which is the problem
[14:55] benvie: it's third party shimmed in functionality that poorly simulates stuff that exists directly in v8 core
[14:55] benvie: something that has a huge impact on performance
[14:55] Aikar: yeah i know, i even wrote a baseline imp before too, but then found that module
[14:56] Aikar: but i gave up on using it because function proxies have a typeof of object instead of function
[14:56] Aikar: so 'instanceof' throws an error
[14:56] benvie: people don't a.) realize it's implemented in v8 core with a flag or b.) don't realize they're even using a module that does this
[14:56] benvie: yeah in the real thing
[14:56] benvie: typeof Proxy.createFunction(stuff) === 'function'
[14:57] benvie: and instanceof
[14:57] Aikar: i have this https://github.com/aikar/autoloader
[14:57] benvie: er wait
[14:57] benvie: lemme check
[14:57] Aikar: i first implemeneted with node-proxy to not need to do file system scanning on load
[14:57] Aikar: but i gave up that idea, just made it scan entire dir on startup and cache it all
[14:58] benvie: vast, huge improvements were made to the harmony features in the 3.7 branch
[14:58] eschnou has joined the channel
[14:58] Aikar: which i guess is partially better in some ways
[14:58] Marlemann: Don't want to bother you.. but Node.js is really great & simple... I like the http supp. but i think there shout also be a implementation for HTCPCP =)
[14:58] Aikar: what is that Marlemann ?
[14:59] Aikar: never heard of it
[14:59] tomlion has joined the channel
[14:59] Marlemann: i will tell you but.. it isnt a joke
[14:59] josephg: HDCP?

[15:01] Marlemann: Thats for controlling coffee machines, but no joke, dont want to mess you around, i really want a plugin for that.. .. 
[15:01] benvie: this is some useful stuff I implemented (needs updating though) for using proxies https://github.com/Benvie/meta-objects/tree/master/lib
[15:01] ashwinp has joined the channel
[15:01] benvie: and I've implemented a few features for dom.js to run in node, which relies entirely on Proxies to create an IDL compliant host for the DOM in javascript
[15:01] Marlemann: at the start it was a RFC Joke but there are really coffee machines that are supporting this protocol... 
[15:02] josephg: SubStack could probably bang out a HTCPCP implementation in about 5 minutes...

[15:07] shanebo has joined the channel
[15:07] Aikar: devaholic: its meant to simplify large "applications" where you will start to have a large codebase, so if you need say 15 diff things in 1 file, itll smart load them for you on demand. so you can build common code libraries for your applications and use as a submodule/external etc and load as needed

[15:08] Aikar: ewww
[15:08] Aikar: i see eval
[15:08] devaholic: Aikar: i hear that. not sure of the best implementation as of yet. node-directory requires subdirs and i use it with index.js files to get rid of a lot of require statements that are repetitive 
[15:09] devaholic: well it calls require on every path in the same directory except it's own
[15:10] Aikar: yeah autoloader doesnt do that
[15:10] devaholic: i use it to load up a huge library of plugins and schemas
[15:10] tih-ra has joined the channel
[15:10] Aikar: it sets up getters so that when a variable is attempted to be used, it then requires the file
[15:10] EuroNerd has joined the channel

[15:14] Aikar: verbosity is nice, but when your developing large scale applications when you have ALOT of code, it can get to be a hassle. and if you name your vars smart like MyApp.Foo.Bar.Baz and your aware of how your app works, you know everything on the MyApp var is in lib/MyApp/ so its then lib/MyApp/Foo/Bar.js and you know EXACTLY where the code is for that object

[17:53] rauchg has joined the channel
[17:53] mikekelly: am I right in thinking that Connect middleware can't modify the resposne ?
[17:53] autarch: is there a sane way to get useful information about the call stack that doesn't involve parsing an exception?
[17:53] autarch: huge bonus points if this works both in node and browsers
[17:54] TheJH: autarch, "arguments.callee.caller"
[17:54] TheJH: autarch, note that this doesn't work with recursion
[17:54] autarch: which returns a function object - how do I get that function's name?
[17:55] TheJH: autarch, ".name"
[17:55] autarch: yeah, that's empty for some reason
[17:55] mikekelly: creationix: is that right? I can't modify the response from Connect middleware without monkey patching ?
[17:55] TheJH: autarch, that means it's either an anonymous function or you're using IE
[17:55] autarch: hmm, I'm using node in this case
[17:56] sir_tyrion: What is the best way to return a variable at the end of a readable stream? `x = str.on('data', function(msg){return msg;});?
[17:56] TheJH: autarch, you can still inspect its source with .toString()
[17:56] autarch: TheJH: yeah, that much I know
[17:56] autarch: so this is a function that belongs to an object - foo.prototype.funcName = function () { ... }
[17:56] autarch: what I'm looking for is "funcName"
[17:57] zomg: sir_tyrion: it doesn't quite work like that. What you're assigning to x is what str.on() is returning, which is not what the callback returns
[17:57] baudehlo: autarch: do you get the function name in new Error().stack?
[17:57] sir_tyrion: I am making requests that return a JSON formatted string, but I am having problems assigning the output to a variable

[17:58] baudehlo: you can get bits out of the Error stack with some fudgehackery, but it's v8 specific.
[17:58] autarch: baudehlo: yeah, that's probably not the best approach for what I'm doing
[17:58] autarch: I think I'll just parse the stack trace for now
[17:59] autarch: sigh ... sometimes javascript is just such an anemic language

[17:59] TheJH: autarch, substack built something that just puts wrappers around all operations to build a cross-engine cool stack trace, but I'm not sure whether it's open source

[18:01] jakehow has joined the channel
[18:01] pita: it was a http server that logged
[18:01] baudehlo: autarch: also bear in mind inspecting the stack is really slow in JS.
[18:01] autarch: yeah
[18:01] TheJH: pita, well, I'd try making sure that the problem really is the fs stuff
[18:01] pita: http requests that didn't need to read a file still worked
[18:01] fmeyer_ has joined the channel
[18:01] pita: its not reproducable
[18:01] baudehlo: I could only get 100k inspections per second out of it.

[18:02] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[18:02] baudehlo: but fair enough, if it's just for static code generation
[18:02] TheJH: pita, mmhm... what node version?
[18:03] autarch: baudehlo: well, for the first pass it'll actually run at runtime, but that's the proof of concept version
[18:03] pita: TheJH: 0.4.12
[18:03] wilmoore has joined the channel
[18:03] autarch: once the meta model actually works 100% it's really really easy to write something to generate optimized code
[18:03] baudehlo: autarch: did you want to see my code for examining the stack via Error.prepareStackTrace?
[18:03] autarch: baudehlo: there's this thing - https://github.com/eriwen/javascript-stacktrace
[18:03] TheJH: pita, why not 0.6.x? also, next time, attach a debugger to it and find out what really is the problem.
[18:04] autarch: baudehlo: but I wouldn't mind seeing yours too
[18:04] TheJH: pita, you can open the debugging port with some special kill signal
[18:04] pita: TheJH: really, which one?

[18:08] autarch: porting Moose is actually a lot easier, I think
[18:09] autarch: especially for code I want to work in browser - I'm mostly using node just cause it's way easier to run tests that way
[18:09] baudehlo: fair enough.
[18:09] baudehlo: you should switch to node for server side work.
[18:09] autarch: the more I use JS the more I realize that language is not even close to done
[18:10] autarch: like this conversation we just had about stack traces - this seems like language design 101 stuff
[18:10] autarch: dynamic languages should allow you to inspect the running interpreter
[18:10] baudehlo: the implementations do... mostly. It's the cross-browser aspect that always bites you.
[18:11] autarch: right

[18:38] Tprice: dont want to keep restarting the app
[18:38] Tprice: would use forever under linux but trying windows
[18:38] langworthy_ has joined the channel
[18:38] swaj: Tprice: it'll sit in the foreground, though.  You can't background a node process unless you wrap it in a windows service.
[18:39] swaj: Tprice: even with forever, you'd have to run it inside something like NSSM to get it to background and restart when the server reboots.

[18:39] mmalecki: lol, windows really can't daemonize processes?
[18:39] simenbrekken has joined the channel
[18:40] swaj: as windows services, yes
[18:40] Tprice: just looking for dev evn
[18:40] Tprice: in the end the app would run under linux
[18:40] mmalecki: and in a sane (unix-ey)?
[18:40] simenbrekken has joined the channel
[18:40] swaj: neither can unix, you have to background a node process with nohup or fork it.  Same thing happens in windows.
[18:40] satyr has joined the channel
[18:40] mmalecki: Tprice: best to develop in the same env you'll deploy to
[18:41] Tprice: yeah just thinking i can write a script to watch a dir and refork when something changes
[18:42] Tprice: mmalecki: if it runs on both is that not better?
[18:42] Tprice: lol
[18:42] mmalecki: Tprice: yeah, of course that's better.
[18:42] Edy: hint: nodemon
[18:42] daveluke: cross domain communication.. how does you do it?
[18:42] mmalecki: but on windows you won't be able to use some linux-specific things and vice versa
[18:43] autarch has left the channel
[18:43] swaj: so yeah, on windows, there's no way that I know of to fork a process into the background.  You have to use a windows service.

[20:25] adrianF: putting all my "global" stuff in a commons object and use it due require, or use them directly due require, or make them global (global.couch = ....), or export them in my main app.js and require app.js in my modules (require(app.js).couch..), or pass the object as a attribute?

[22:12] dilvie: flatiron vs express: let the flame war begin.
[22:12] dilvie: Which would you use, and why?
[22:12] jerrysv: dilvie: bricks

[22:13] jerrysv: dilvie: why not?
[22:14] dmsuperman: A fair point ^
[22:14] dilvie: jerrysv: you're biased. =)
[22:14] dmsuperman: You're biased too dilvie 
[22:14] dmsuperman: what's your point
[22:14] jerrysv: of course i'm biased, definitely not going to hide that :)
[22:14] dmsuperman: :P
[22:14] jerrysv: ask me about date libraries some time
[22:14] dilvie: Of course you're gonna think you're bringin' the hotness. It works the way you think a framework should work. =)
[22:14] dmsuperman: dilvie: And you asked for exactly that
[22:14] dmsuperman: Personal opinions on frameworks
[22:15] dmsuperman: Based on personal preferences
[22:15] EhevuTov: jerrysv, what is better about bricks than express?
[22:15] dilvie: I asked for personal opinions about two specific frameworks.
[22:15] tjholowaychuk: if you can't select libs on you're own you're in trouble haha
[22:15] dmsuperman: dilvie: Which itself was already biased
[22:15] xavier_d: WarheadsSE: I was more tempted by nginx. The question was a proxy module in node.js (didn't find one)
[22:15] dmsuperman: So clearly you aren't concerned with bias
[22:15] dilvie: fair point.
[22:15] WarheadsSE: nginx should be easy as well
[22:15] WarheadsSE: well documented too
[22:15] jerrysv: EhevuTov: different. but the real differences are that bricks uses an apache hook model routing engine, and has pretty decent events
[22:15] dilvie: But I still trust a third party nomination more than the author's nomination.
[22:15] dilvie: =)
[22:16] dilvie: creator bias is the blindest kind.
[22:16] dmsuperman: Anyway anybody know how to reference the original list element using forEach?
[22:16] dmsuperman: I nominate bricksjs
[22:16] dilvie: w00t
[22:16] dilvie: that's better.

[22:16] EhevuTov: it's about to get real up in this piece
[22:16] dilvie: ok. express vs bricks vs flatiron. 
[22:17] dmsuperman: dilvie: what about connect!
[22:17] jerrysv: dilvie: i still like bricks, but mostly for the reasons that i stated to EhevuTov

[22:37] zomg: Well, thankfully I abstracted my code enough that it should not be hard to rip out the protocol parser and replace it if it comes to that

[22:49] GoldFire33: I've got a JS file (client-side) that I need to dynamically load some data in before it is loaded into the browser. I'm using Express, but I'm not sure the best way to do this (the file isn't using a template engine).
[22:49] bnoordhuis: brainproxy: what kind of values do you need to store?
[22:50] bnoordhuis: brainproxy: if they're primitives, like bytes or ints, you could store them in a buffer or Int32Array
[22:50] brainproxy: bnoordhuis: I need to hashes that look like { thing: ..., rank: # }
[22:50] bnoordhuis: oh, that's not going to fly then
[22:50] brainproxy: I need to *store...
[22:50] brainproxy: this is the implementation I'm using

[22:51] iBooyaa: brainproxy: you written that test code for setTimeout mem leak? ;)
[22:51] brainproxy: iBooyaa: oh, I thought I could slink away on that one :p
[22:51] brainproxy: actually, it turns out to be some sort of issue with closures around settimeout
[22:51] airandfingers: anyone have any recommendations for hosting services for node.js apps? so far I've looked at NodeSocket (private beta), Nodejitsu (private beta), and Engine Yard
[22:52] iBooyaa: hahaha nice try ;) heh no biggie was just happy to test
[22:52] brainproxy: iBooyaa: still not obvious why it causes such a horrible leak
[22:52] iBooyaa: airandfingers: cloude node and cloud9 for testing
[22:52] brainproxy: but by using underscore's implementation of _.defer and _.delay, rather than the ones I roles using coffeescript splats
[22:52] brainproxy: the leak goes away
[22:52] iBooyaa: cloud9 is only for the duration of the code running
[22:53] iBooyaa: go with nodejitsu they're the best I've seen

[22:55] GoldFire33: Is there another way to do what I'm trying that doesn't require AJAX calls from within the JS file? That just adds unnecessary overhead.

[23:17] tjholowaychuk: with jade..
[23:17] base698: I figured
