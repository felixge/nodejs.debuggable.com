[00:40] cconstantine: I have a fairly compute heavy method in a setInterval
[00:40] mrchess: like you set it for 500ms but the execution takes longer?
[00:40] mrchess: oh
[00:40] cconstantine: yeah
[00:40] jj0hns0n has joined the channel
[00:41] mrchess: wouldn't that cause a memory leak?

[00:41] cconstantine: server
[00:41] mrchess: or server
[00:41] mrchess: since its executing the fn faster than it can complete it
[00:41] mrchess: it will just keep executing it 
[00:41] mrchess: despite its stilln ot finished
[00:42] cconstantine: but they won't overlap
[00:42] mrchess: you should just put a flag in your interval to tell it not to execute if it is still getting run
[00:42] Ratty_: If the function blocks the thread then it won't execute again until the previous execution has finished
[00:43] cconstantine: mrchess, but I thought node was single-threaded

[00:57] montylounge has left the channel
[00:57] ag_: skunkape, I've been using it in the global scope so that I can split files without having to module.export stuff. It has been working fine until I introduced this model. 
[00:58] skunkape: is the model in a seperate file than the main app?
[00:58] Ratty_: globals are icky
[00:58] montylounge has joined the channel
[00:59] ag_: skunkape, I think it has to do with the nesting of arrays and mongoose trying to parse it as an "Mongoose object"
[01:00] devongovett has joined the channel
[01:00] skunkape: ag_, we need to see more of you application layout. if the model is in a seperate file, you may just need to add "exports.BoothModel = BoothModel;

[01:01] Nexxy has joined the channel
[01:01] SuMarDi has joined the channel
[01:02] ag_: skunkape, since there is no 'var' in front of BoothModel, it is in the global scope once the file is "require"-d so I can access it in any other file.

[01:12] skunkape: ag_, try console.log(util.inspect(name)). If you are trying to collect data in the "model" file and pass it to the "controller", this will not work as expected. Your collection will be exported as a Model. you must handle the files inside of the callback.

[01:13] mavus: skunkape, what's wrong with console.dir? :)
[01:13] ag_: skunkape, I think it's just setting to lowercase. I think mongoose sees the { Name: ... } in "Slots" and thinks it's the mongoose type object, and since there is no 'name' it's throwing the error.
[01:15] skunkape: ag_, what does array.js:40:22 look like?
[01:16] ag_: skunkape, That's mongoose's files... I guess I could look it up but that's not my code.

[03:17] Nuck: elliottcable: Pretty sure there's a query string compiler?

[03:17] autojack_: any thoughts?

[03:18] abiii has joined the channel
[03:18] Stephen: autojack_: Did you install via npm or git?
[03:18] Nuck: Stephen: Compression?
[03:18] autojack_: npm
[03:18] Nuck: JSON is JSON, it's a pretty specific thing
[03:18] Stephen: global or local?
[03:18] Nuck: You can't really compres that
[03:18] autojack_: im using the latest sqlite3
[03:18] elliottcable: jesus, abiii nearly gave me a heart attack
[03:18] autojack_: SQLite version 3.7.7.1 
[03:19] elliottcable: I thought I was looking at another channel (my own); and I have an ex named “Abi.” I was like, HOW DID SHE FIND ME HERE!?
[03:19] abiii: elliottcable: who's this?
[03:19] Stephen: autojack_: no, i mean did you npm install -g sqlite3 or npm install sqllite3
[03:19] elliottcable: abiii ⁓ nah, nobody you know.
[03:19] elliottcable: abiii ⁓ your /join just freaked me out. Didn’t realize I was looking at #Node.js instead of #elliottcable >,>
[03:19] autojack_: i have tried both.. same problem
[03:19] Stephen: Nuck: JSON is text, highly compressible, see UglifyJS
[03:19] abiii: elliottcable: lol
[03:19] Stephen: Or gzip, or whatever
[03:19] tk has joined the channel
[03:20] Nuck: Stephen: JSON is a specific syntax
[03:20] jamescarr: ChrisPartridge, hmmm... I actually got Sequelize working. Had to clone the repo vs. using the module
[03:20] Stephen: Just looking for experiences or favorites
[03:20] jamescarr: I mean, using the npm module
[03:20] Stephen: Nuck: I know what JSON is
[03:20] Nuck: gzipping, sure, but as for compressing it in JS, not happening
[03:20] Stephen: Nuck: There are many ways to compress it, say common property name substitution with libraries that now how to reconstruct each
[03:21] autojack_: stephen: no thoughts?
[03:21] Nuck: Stephen: The moment you do that, it stops being JSON
[03:21] Nuck: JSON is *very* specific
[03:21] Stephen: autojack_: You might try removing then using git, that's always my first try

[03:21] autojack_: and compiling manually?
[03:21] Nuck: Stephen: JSON.stringify is probably about as optimal as you're gonna get :P
[03:22] Stephen: If it can be read on both ends and decompressed to standard json, or parsed into an object, I'm good.
[03:22] Stephen: Nuck: Nevermind man. I'm not quite sure you understand where I'm going. Thanks for the help though
[03:22] Stephen: autojack_: Yeah, just be sure to get the dependencies
[03:22] Nuck: Most JS compressors aren't designed to compress strings, they're designed to compress JavaScript, usually through variable name replacements, etc.
[03:23] necrodearia has joined the channel
[03:24] Nuck: UglifyJS is mostly through renaming things (but it does a damn good job of it) with a bunch of other tiny optimizations

[03:33] Stephen: jerrysv: Thanks
[03:33] Stephen: I suppose I should call it a "serialization library"
[03:33] autojack_: stephen: it just says do the normal configure, make
[03:33] jerrysv: true, but so is json
[03:33] jerrysv: with other languages

I then try to find that record using the same date but I get no results. Do I have to do something different to the Date object to search on it?

[09:17] wnoronha: I have an application that calls a JSON api, formats it and returns back the information as HTML. Since the JSON API is very slow ~500ms. Node keeps getting blocked. Is there a recommended work around? 
[09:18] abraxas: wnoronha: what makes it that slow?
[09:18] abraxas: wnoronha: is the json api a third party api? not yours?
[09:18] Layke2 has joined the channel
[09:18] wnoronha: abraxas, its a 3rd party api
[09:18] Stephen: wnoronha: You're calling the JSON api asynchronously and it's freezing node?
[09:19] abraxas: wnoronha: that shouldn't be able to block your node
[09:19] Stephen: wnoronha: I agree with abraxas

[09:28] wnoronha: So what happens is the user hits the url, i do a http.get(options, function(..)) once I get the data I send it back to the user
[09:29] wnoronha: Since the 3rdparty guy takes 500ms + to respond my performance drops
[09:30] wnoronha: Would it be advisable to run more node instances of the app (i think it would be a bad idea)
[09:31] DrMcKay has joined the channel
[09:33] abraxas: You never seem to close your http request
[09:33] abraxas: When you send stuff back, instead of send(body), call end(body)

[09:33] abraxas: or does app take care of that?
[09:35] wnoronha: abraxas, I was under the assumption that when you use http.request you need to manually close the connection but http.get does it for you 
[09:35] sbrekken has joined the channel
[09:35] wnoronha: The app is built on expressjs 
[09:36] abraxas: Right, I've never used express, so I'm not sure how that deals with http responses.
[09:36] abraxas: So never mind that part, I guess...
[09:36] abraxas: Other than this, your code looks absolutely fine. This should (will) not block your node.

[09:59] Newky: abraxas: from what I've read of express docs, they use just send()

[12:41] eldios: can any web designer answer the following question: why is addressing a DOM element using a chain "element.class" construct better than using the id ? 
[12:41] mcepl: eldios: I am not a web designer, but I think the answer is "It isn't" ;)
[12:41] eldios: cause I'm looking at css-tricks.com videos and I'm continously thinking.. why does he avoids using id when it could be that simple?
[12:42] misterm: eldios: it's not "better" per se...they're for different things
[12:42] davidbanham: eldios: That's a contentious point. There are a lot of people saying you should never ever use ids, then there are a lot of people saying "Well what the fuck else are they for? Why wouldn't you?"
[12:42] H4ns: eldios: id's are often less modular, as they need to be unique across a page.
[12:42] aaronmcadam: eldios ids are much faster
[12:42] eldios: oh flame war... there we go =) now I like it
[12:42] misterm: eldios: if you mean in terms of css, yes some people think you shouldn't use ids in your styles
[12:43] aaronmcadam: why?
[12:43] eldios: H4ns, can you explain that a lil' deeper?
[12:43] eldios: if anyone have actual reason.. just spit'em out now =)
[12:43] aaronmcadam: well DOM getElBy...
[12:43] aaronmcadam: is much faster because obv there is only one instance of an id on a page
[12:43] misterm: it's a separation of concerns thing, classes better represent styling information
[12:43] aaronmcadam: for generic styling yeah
[12:44] aaronmcadam: but you can run into specificity problems with only using class selectors
[12:44] eldios: but all-in-all you're exactly wanting to reach *THAT* particoular element.. which *is* unique in the page..so.. why not use its id?
[12:44] aaronmcadam: yes you should be
[12:44] H4ns: eldios: all ids across a page must be unique.  if you combine modules from multiple sources on one page and they use overlapping ids, the css will probably not work.  using classes is no guarantee against clashes, but they are often less likely to occur.
[12:44] aaronmcadam: in js anyway
[12:45] davidbanham: For me, the approach is "Use classes for things that make sense to use classes, use id's for things that make sense to use ids"
[12:45] mcepl: ACTION would add that one of root of his disgust over jQuery are calls like $("#someid");
[12:45] aaronmcadam: eh?
[12:45] eldios: mcepl, why don't you like that?
[12:45] eldios: H4ns, that makes sense
[12:45] ph^ has joined the channel
[12:45] eldios: +1
[12:45] eldios: thanks for your opinion
[12:46] aaronmcadam: eldios: http://addyosmani.com/blog/jquery-performance-tips-2011/
[12:46] aaronmcadam: that goes over selector performance
[12:46] misterm: yea, I think we're talking specifically in stylesheets though
[12:47] misterm: in js code it wouldn't be a consideration
[12:47] aaronmcadam: he was askin bout dom at one stage
[12:47] mcepl: because it translates (in best case, I suspect much worse in most cases) to document.querySelector("#someid") which is horrible.
[12:47] eldios: mm... yeah I was aware of performance issues of DOM-walking of jquery...
[12:47] aaronmcadam: what's horrible about that
[12:47] eldios: DOM-traversing..
[12:47] bradleymeck has joined the channel
[12:47] eldios: mcepl, go on... I'm so ignorant about what you're trying to reach...
[12:48] eldios: why is that horrible? enlighten us
[12:48] misterm: mcepl: also, what do you propose instead?
[12:48] mcepl: getElementById as $DEITY intended
[12:48] eldios: lulz
[12:49] mcepl: because it is horribly slow, you are bringing whole CSS selector machinery (in better cases compiled in C++, in most cases I am afraid in javascript).
[12:49] misterm: mcepl: $("#id") will translate to document.getElementById("id")
[12:49] jetienne has joined the channel
[12:49] aaronmcadam: yeah
[12:49] H4ns: "horribly slow" my ass
[12:49] eldios: ahahah
[12:49] aaronmcadam: fud
[12:49] misterm: mcepl: but I agree that when people use jQuery they tend to think they need to use jQuery for every little thing
[12:49] misterm: which is often not the case
[12:49] phiggins has joined the channel
[12:50] aaronmcadam: it takes time for people to learn that yes
[12:50] kdng-tr7 has joined the channel
[12:50] eldios: so.. resuming..
[12:50] eldios: 1) ids possible collision between different pages 
[12:50] aaronmcadam: so yeah, in jq, it's id, then element, then class, then pseudo for performance
[12:51] davidbanham: I tend to use an awful lot of jquery because I know very little about the gotchas of different browsers, and I know that if I'm using jquery someone else has figured out that it's going to work in all platforms.
[12:51] eldios: 2) $('#ids') is terribly slow and badly implemented
[12:51] eldios: all agree?
[12:51] aaronmcadam: no
[12:51] H4ns: eldios: no.
[12:51] aaronmcadam: that's fud
[12:51] mcepl: eldios: in how many cases you don't have IDs generated and yet still you combine mutliple pages together?
[12:51] xerox has joined the channel
[12:52] kdng-tr7 has left the channel
[12:52] eldios: not many  since I'm a n00b but I suppose that PROs does that quite often if you don't wat to use a framework
[12:52] eldios: *suppose*
[12:52] mcepl: if real pros combine multiple pages (or parts of the pages, to be exact) they should generate IDs (and probably they use some CMS anyway).

[12:52] eldios: so... leaving 2 out cause it's quite controversary... we'll keep #1

[12:54] sreeix has joined the channel
[12:54] misterm: eldios: it's not that you should never use ID's it's that you shouldn't use them in styling...and that's only what some people believe
[12:54] H4ns: bradleymeck: you mean you want to know which key has been used?
[12:54] aaronmcadam: well anything that needs to be unique would have the potential to collide
[12:54] bradleymeck: aaronmcadam i have multiple pubkeys for this user. H4ns yes.
[12:54] aaronmcadam: ah soz
[12:54] Glenjamin: warning, warning: premature optimisation alert!
[12:54] Glenjamin: don't worry about selector speed until you've profiled. Applies to JS and CSS
[12:54] eldios: Glenjamin, AHAHAHAH
[12:54] H4ns: bradleymeck: you'll have to set some environment variable in the authorized_keys file for each key.  there is no built-in way
[12:55] aaronmcadam: i think it's more of an academic general question
[12:55] H4ns: bradleymeck: (i must admit that it was a while ago when i had and solved that problem, but that approach worked)
[12:55] eldios: Glenjamin, is only a question I had in mind cause I'm seeing videos from css-tricks and he ALWAYS use classes in a much fancy way than he could de using one freaking id
[12:55] eldios: that's it
[12:55] Glenjamin: id makes sense for some thing

[12:56] Glenjamin: there's nothing to gain or lose by using class="menu" instead of id="menu"

[14:49] malletjo: Hello folks, i have some huge process and i want them in sync mode. As far as i know , i can't know when the process is completed ( parse xml + mysql queries) . The only way i found it to start a child process and add "exit" event on it. So its working perfectly. The problem is since its all separated process , i can't do a big mysql transaction  but only one for each process.  Can't find a way to do both , any ideas ?

[14:55] malletjo: Glenjamin, check this scenario : open xml file , read first object , add query , read next object add query ... until it's done. Since all "add queries" are async , i can't really know when they all are completed ( except check in the queue if any exist .. or store a counter and --counter when i'm in the callback

[15:41] lukegalea: DrMcKay: Cool. I put a lot of effort into the Type 1 stuff, even though it's less than 5% of the population just because there isn't much out there in the way of apps for type 1, but he should be happy from a type 2 perspective too.

[15:54] tjholowaychuk: typically*
[15:54] tjholowaychuk: but some people dont
[15:54] Glenjamin: i'd use package.json for that purpose
[15:54] Marak: tjholowaychuk: derp, use the right attribute in package.json
[15:54] tjholowaychuk: so you have to require('./foo/lib/foo')
[15:54] Marak: no, you use the 'main' property in package.json
[15:54] tjholowaychuk: meh
[15:54] Marak: and require('foo')

[17:14] TheJH: pandeiro, not sure about what writing to a file before it's opened will do
[17:14] TheJH: pandeiro, maybe it gets buffered, but I'm not sure
[17:14] jerrysv has joined the channel
[17:14] pandeiro: JSManiacs: TheJH: it has been working fine but just now it produced an error that the file wasn't there in /tmp/
[17:14] pandeiro: (when my callback tried to do something with it)
[17:14] guidocalvano: if I want to call function bound to some object, a function which is bound to the parent type of that object, it fails because if the bound object is unwrapped, it is cast from void* to its parent class.
[17:15] guidocalvano: this fails because it can't find the member function anymore

[18:05] JSManiacs: dexter_e:  I agree with you… I feel everyone is on crazy pills.  I don't necessaily think JSON dom is the end all- cause it didn't do easy templating like Jade or mustach
[18:05] JSManiacs: but I'm not sure why people use both
[18:05] jesusabdullah: well
[18:06] dexter_e: and more specifically are there some obvious things that delimiters are still necessary for?
[18:06] jesusabdullah: I think DOM-based approaches are a really good idea
[18:06] jesusabdullah: Honestly, templates kinda suck
[18:06] pquerna: isaacs: yeah. 
[18:06] JSManiacs: jesusabdullah: dexter_e: Hey… So I sent this link to substack yesterday  http://jsfiddle.net/ryanstevens/mwFXM/
[18:06] jesusabdullah: but the current DOM solutions can be unweildy sometimes---I mean, setting up a jsdom with jquery and then having to use jquery to build your thing?
[18:06] jesusabdullah: Could be a lot easier.
[18:07] JSManiacs: its a (non) open source templating engine I wrote at my last company
[18:07] Marak: hey isaacs did you see that npm preserve thing? http://nodeknockout.com/teams/preservation-society , that essentially opens up a MITM problem for my npm creds right?
[18:07] JSManiacs: exposing some examples in JSFiddle
[18:07] isaacs: Marak: yeah
[18:07] Marak: smells like all 2s for me
[18:07] isaacs: Marak: if you trust them, then use em :)
[18:07] jesusabdullah: JSManiacs: Nice, reminds me a little bit of weld at first glance
[18:07] JSManiacs: jesusabdullah: So my idea is to use this DOM baed templating engine in Node with JSDOM
[18:07] Marak: i dont even trust you isaacs 
[18:07] Marak: :p
[18:07] isaacs: Marak: i mean, it's just a caching forward proxy for an npm registry, which is kind of a neat product.
[18:07] dexter_e: JSManiacs: Thats pimpin
[18:07] JSManiacs: jesusabdullah: This is @ryan_stevens by the way
[18:08] Marak: isaacs: not oss though right?
[18:08] jesusabdullah: I figured! :D
[18:08] JSManiacs: it was good hanging last night
[18:08] isaacs: Marak: i could see that being really useful for, like, putting registries in other countries or whatever.
[18:08] isaacs: running on-demand mirrors.
[18:08] jesusabdullah: Yeah, it was a good time!
[18:08] Marak: its a hosted npm service
[18:08] isaacs: Marak: they're gonna os it, i'm sure
[18:08] Marak: you know that?
[18:08] isaacs: i talked to them last night
[18:09] isaacs: yeah, they want anyone to run this anywhere.
[18:09] dexter_e: On top of just the fact that JSDOM lets us skip doubling up functionality for client and server , we get the unbelievable bonus of NO foreign syntax or speciality characters for string insertion.
[18:09] JSManiacs: jesusabdullah: dexter_e: So the value aadd of this templating system is it can be used in Node, and the instructions are carried through and can be reused by the front end.
[18:09] dexter_e: JSManiacs: Diggin in
[18:09] isaacs: Marak: and eventually even use this as a private registry, so that you publish to it, and it doesn't "put back", and only has the packages you actually use in your org, fetching the official ones on demand.
[18:09] isaacs: it's kind of an awesome idea, i think.
[18:09] addisonj__ has joined the channel
[18:10] dexter_e: XML name space syntax right?

[18:10] JSManiacs: dexter_e: Yeah, so that is once again a non opened sourced library (served from a public domain).  It is wrapped around a WdigetManger, which isn't what I'm trying to show here as so much as the templating system.  
[18:13] dexter_e: So back to the noob question: Are there obvious reasons to use delimiter based templates over JSDOM ?

[19:24] DrMcKay: AvianFlu: wait, how?
[19:24] AvianFlu: cause you get file size, and then you say, gimme a read stream, from (end of file - n bytes) to (end of file)
[19:25] AvianFlu: you don't read the whole file on a stat, do you?
[19:25] DrMcKay: AvianFlu: ah, just read it in chunks?
[19:25] AvianFlu: when you call fs.createReadStream
[19:25] chjj: einaros: ah, good call
[19:25] AvianFlu: you can pass in options
[19:25] AvianFlu: two of which are "start" and "end"

[19:42] kohai: @FGRibreau Just updated the Brin.gr's homepage with real-time statistics http://t.co/uKa9kcT #redis #nodejs
[19:42] DrMcKay: TheJH: yes, it does
[19:42] TheWulf: TheJH: does that not install it locally in ~/local/node?
[19:42] DrMcKay: TheJH: format is a bit weird, though

[19:45] TheWulf: DrMcKay: thanks. would you know how I can make that into a global install from the source without having to use apt-get? I want to get the latest version as a global install

[20:22] Daegalus: What would be better to use? Connect, Express, or manually write my own routing/rest stuff. This is for a private api for a backend for a game project I am doing. Nothing outside the game clients and internal use will know the api or use it, and its very specific.
[20:23] Nuck: Daegalus:Real time or no?
[20:24] Daegalus: I real time. Its rpg like game with a turn-based battle system. So partially real time?
[20:24] Daegalus: i think real time*
[20:24] tjholowaychuk: Daegalus express doesnt add any overhead on connect, so your question really should be just raw node vs {connext,express}
[20:24] Daegalus: the clients will be on mobile platforms. So it will be from smartphones/tablets.

[20:27] Daegalus: Anyways, any advice on what route I should go. I guess i want as real time as possible. There will be a lot of calls on the api for information, turns, and actually processing of the games functions (its almost like a mmo)
[20:27] apanda has joined the channel
[20:27] _sorensen_: i would use express
[20:28] tjholowaychuk: Daegalus in reality, you'll most likely end up re-creating everything connect/express do anyway
[20:28] tjholowaychuk: as far as responding with json etc
[20:28] tjholowaychuk: but if you only have a few end-points bypassing routing with a simple switch would help a little
[20:28] Nuck: Seriously, Express is AWESOME
[20:28] Nuck: If it's turn-based, use a RESTful API
[20:28] Daegalus: It will be a RESTful api
[20:28] Nuck: With JSON responses
[20:29] Daegalus: yup
[20:29] Nuck: Daegalus: Well then, Express is ideal for that
[20:29] Aikar: var oCipher = crypto.createCipher('des-cbc', sSecretKey) var sCipherText = oCipher.update(sData, 'ascii') sCipherText += oCipher.final()

[20:29] Nuck: Express is ideal for anything that involves HTTP routing
[20:29] Nuck: Because tjholowaychuk is awesome like that.
[20:29] Aikar: anyone see anything wrong with this to mimic PHP: mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_DES, $sSecretKey, $sData, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC, $this->sInitialValue); ?
[20:29] Daegalus: ok, cool, just wanted to clarify to make sure. WE are ramping up developement and I just learned about Node.js and we did some testing, and it will outdo what we can do with Python atm, so we are deciding on a design switch to write the entire backend in Node.js
[20:30] Aikar: oh... i see that codes using an IV and im not

[20:31] chjj: its a compatibility layer
[20:31] chjj: @rendar
[20:31] Bennito: Express is AWESOME!
[20:31] rendar: chjj: to port node to other platforms?
[20:31] chjj: rendar: it fixes certain cross-platform compatibility things
[20:32] Daegalus: I kinda wish Bitbucket was a bit more popular than it is now, because i so much prefer Hg over Git, but all the fun stuff happens on Github 
[20:32] chjj: yeah, it wraps libev in order to compile on all platforms
[20:32] rendar: chjj: i see, so for now libev is the main thing to "port" for having cross-platform
[20:32] rendar: i see

[20:34] Nuck: Bennito: IT's just retweeting me in IRC
[20:34] chrisdickinson: Daegalus: you can set up web hooks using repocracy on bitbucket and github so you can just push to bitbucket, I do believe.
[20:34] Nuck: chjj: Now we start placing bets on when it'll beat Rails.

[20:39] Nuck: Yes, but Git succeeded where Mercurial couldn't: it got popularity almost overnight
[20:39] Nuck: And it replaced SVN very quickly
[20:39] CoverSlide: Mercurial came after git, didn't it?
[20:39] chjj: Bennito: +1 for watching, -1 for not watching already, so +0
[20:39] Daegalus: Because it had backing and word of mouth from Linus (who wrote it) and it was promoted through all open source projects instantly because of that

[20:40] Nuck: A very high-quality git hosting site
[20:41] Daegalus: According to Wikipedia, Mercurial was started a few days after Git, when everyone wanted to move away from Bitkeeper in 2005
[20:41] Bennito: chjj: Thanks :-D :-D
[20:41] Nuck: Yeah, I thought they were about the same time
[20:41] Aikar: oh didnt see the errors printing
[20:41] Nuck: So it was a fair fight there
[20:41] chjj: i think mercurial was actually one of the few revision control systems linus was okay with?

[20:41] Nuck: First we had Linus supporting us, then we had Github
[20:42] chjj: yeah, git had a really quick path to success
[20:42] CoverSlide: Linus is quoted as saying if Mercurial came first he would have no reason to create git

[21:57] isaacs: and had stopped caring about, because, of course, it's in the db

[21:59] DrMcKay: Marak: it has few bugs, I was able to move my piece after it dropped
[21:59] isaacs: but, like all tools, you have to know its strengths and weaknesses.  i worry that a lot of people are using mongo for cases it's not really designed to handle, and they wont' find out until they're under production load.
[22:00] Marak: yeah i dont understand those game mechanics at all
[22:00] isaacs: sammmy: but all analysis is, in some form, "data loss"
[22:00] mecablaze: is there a standard way of waiting for a set of asynchronous tasks to complete? i.e. a set of asynchronous fs.unlink's
[22:00] sammmy: isaacs: analysis? Maybe I'm not understanding what you mean.
[22:00] chjj: mecablaze: yes, it depends on how you want to do it though
[22:00] chjj: mecablaze: in serial or parallel?

[22:02] chjj: yes, good to at least learn it
[22:02] isaacs: sammmy: well, when you ask yourself "how many chairs are in this room", you lose some data about the room in order to focus on the question at hand.
[22:02] DrMcKay: and better to use
[22:02] isaacs: sammmy: for a lot of tasks, capturing data quickly is more important than capturing every shred of data.

[22:02] isaacs: sammmy: let's say you're watching markets for trends, or analyzing the twitter public stream to figure out where fires are happening, etc.
[22:03] chjj: mecablaze: theres 2 ways to iterate over a set of async actions, you can either start them all at once, or wait for one to complete before starting the next iteration
[22:03] isaacs: or just tracking clicks on a website
[22:03] isaacs: sammmy: losing some data is better than slowing down the pipeline
[22:03] DrMcKay: sammmy: but after all, you wouldn't want to end up without a room when asking about chairs ;)
[22:03] chjj: mecablaze: parallel is faster, but serial will guarantee everything finishes in order

[22:03] v8bot_:  DrMcKay has given a beer to isaacs. isaacs now has 2 beers.
[22:03] chjj: mecablaze: since youre just deleting a bunch of files, the order probably doesnt matter
[22:04] mecablaze: chjj, if I don't care about order, could i just have each callback set a boolean to true in a list and when all the booleans in the list are true, then proceed?
[22:04] mecablaze: Or is that a "naive approach"
[22:04] sammmy: isaacs: sure you lose the data you don't need when _retrieving_ data, but when preserving data, you generally would like to keep what's important; if someone cancels a reaccuring bill on their account and we don't record that, well that's not good.
[22:05] chjj: mecablaze: a parallel loop would look like this: var i = obj.length; obj.forEach(function() { ... if (!--i) callback(); });
[22:05] sammmy: DrMcKay: my point exactly.
[22:05] isaacs: sammmy: yeah, that's why i would be very careful about using mongo for tracking data where every single bit counts.
[22:05] DrMcKay: sammmy: that's why we have clusters and sharding (one of many reasons)

[22:06] chjj: mecablaze: go check out the code
[22:06] isaacs: sammmy: on the other side of the spectrum, there's riak, which is slow and generally a pita, but does do a *very* good job about keeping every single piece of data you ever tell it, unless you thermite the boxes.
[22:06] mrdoodles: if you use -g on a module where does it install to?

[22:13] isaacs: jesusabdullah: the list of ports mapped for ssh do no.de zones.
[22:13] isaacs: map-reduce in riak is definitely costly.  secondary indexes would be nice, but i don't know what goes into adding that in riak's design, of course.
[22:14] chovy: anyone have an example of a user registration form with nodejs and mongodb?
[22:15] freewil: hehe map-reduce work and global warming in the same sentence is laughable to this bitcoin miner :)

[22:17] isaacs: i do dig the api for map-reduce in riak.
[22:17] jesusabdullah: I think I think about MR wrong, though
[22:17] isaacs: it's kinda nice.  couch's is kind of wonky
[22:17] n42: well, actually, eval is kind of a security risk
[22:17] jesusabdullah: in that when I think of distributed stuff like MR, my mind automatically goes to, "we can run SO many physics simulations!"
[22:17] isaacs: n42: absolutely :)
[22:17] n42: I know in Ruby you can do "foo".intern which will return :foo
[22:17] isaacs: n42: why do you need it?

[22:18] isaacs: n42: when you see eval(), it means your'e probably doing something at least mostly wrong
[22:18] n42: yup
[22:18] jesusabdullah: What are these symbols?
[22:19] n42: in Ruby, you can use a symbol to represent an object -- it's a literal, :foo always equals :foo
[22:19] jesusabdullah: sure
[22:19] n42: while "foo" is an instance of a string and might not always equal another "foo" string

[22:19] n42: but you can define a function named "foo" and reference it with :foo
[22:20] n42: this is all Ruby of course
[22:20] n42: I'm just not that familiar with JS/Node
[22:20] jesusabdullah: ah
[22:20] jesusabdullah: I just reference a function with its name
[22:21] n42: basically, I'm trying to peak at an object's value and I might not know what the object is named

[22:31] n42: I think it has something to do with leading whitespace; is that allowed?
[22:31] brainproxy: let me see
[22:31] chjj: n42: are you learning coffeescript before javascript?
[22:32] chjj: i would recommend going the other way around
[22:32] n42: nah, I first started writing in JavaScript and then discovered CoffeeScript
[22:32] n42: but there are certain things that I may have missed before switching
[22:32] tjholowaychuk: n42 stick with js you'll actually get jobs
[22:32] tjholowaychuk: and learn to appreciate the good things, and *actually* learn the bad things
[22:33] n42: I constantly compile the coffeescript into JS to see what's going on, though

[22:33] DrMcKay: JS itself is good enough
[22:33] n42: yeah, I can appreciate that
[22:33] n42: for sure
[22:33] brainproxy: n42: leading whitespace in block comments seems to have some gotchas
[22:34] DrMcKay: and seriously, I've never felt a desire to pack it into anything else
[22:34] tjholowaychuk: js already has too much syntactic crap
[22:34] tjholowaychuk: more is not a good thing
[22:34] n42: I'm not planning on sticking with CoffeeScript, but it's helping me bridge from Ruby to JS
[22:34] _sorensen_: its kinda like learning jade before learning html
[22:35] tbranyen: or learning javascript before assembly
[22:35] Daegalus: WAIT, you are supposed to learn HTML before Jade? CRUD *goes back to the drawing board*
[22:35] tbranyen: i mean who does that
[22:35] _sorensen_: though not a good enough of a comparison
[22:35] brainproxy: i agree with that; i don't think learning coffee first would have been a good approach for me
[22:35] _sorensen_: i learned assembly first! :P
[22:35] tmpvar: i dont think it matters as long as you keep learning
[22:36] apanda has joined the channel
[22:36] brainproxy: but being fairly well versed in JS, I appreciate coffee and other tools that work to encapsulate things in plain JS that can get clunky
[22:36] n42: true, I'm not the kind of person to just read syntax, accept it and move on
[22:36] tjholowaychuk: n42 yeah exactly, language features are what people should care about

[22:42] shanebo: brainproxy any experience with haibu?
[22:42] tjholowaychuk: yeah i guess if they are long-lived it's not a huge deal
[22:43] brainproxy: shanebo: no, not yet, but the idea of it makes sense to me and its on my radar screen for a larger project
[22:43] shanebo: brainproxy I was looking at this for multiple apps: http://coolaj86.info/articles/vhosts-with-nodejs.html
[22:44] brainproxy: tjholowaychuk's cluster provides some similar facilities i think
[22:44] arthurd has joined the channel
[22:44] tjholowaychuk: the examples use connect's vhost
[22:44] mraleph: tjholowaychuk: yes. but as they share nothing — a problem of duplication will arise.
[22:45] brainproxy: i mean cluster w/ respect to haibu; the coolaj86.info thing shows connect's vhost in action
[22:45] mraleph: but it might not be a problem at all. especially if you create like isolate per core and do some processing...
[22:46] kiffness has joined the channel
[22:46] Sorella has joined the channel
[22:46] shanebo: so which is better for a smaller few projects?
[22:47] tjholowaychuk: shanebo if you're fine with managing them as one unit go with connect's vhost
[22:47] tjholowaychuk: if you want to manage them separately use node-http-proxy
[22:47] tjholowaychuk: or nginx etc
[22:47] usoban has joined the channel
[22:47] scwoodal has joined the channel
[22:48] shanebo: tjholowaychuk, one unit meaning I'd have to fire all apps from a single server.js file?

[22:48] tjholowaychuk: shanebo yeah, connect's vhost() middleware is.. just middleware haha, everything is still in one process
[22:48] tjholowaychuk: the apps act as callbacks

[22:59] halfhalo: sooo… anyone have any suggestions for something similar to socket.io but with node clients?  Ideally something that could talk over either tcp or udp (or others) seamlessly.  I looked at faye, but from what I saw it broadcasts all messages to all clients whom are listening, which is not what I want.
