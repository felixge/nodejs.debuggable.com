[00:00] TooTallNate: tenshihan: ya
[00:00] garrettwilkin: Do I need to run node 0.4 to use hook.io?
[00:00] garrettwilkin: since it depends on npm 1.0.x
[00:00] garrettwilkin: and it seems that i can't install npm 1.0.103
[00:00] garrettwilkin: if I have node 0.6 installed
[00:00] garrettwilkin: it says that I would have to use node 0.4?
[00:00] tenshihan: TooTallNate: I am now attempting node-gyp on linux as it's our dev server. I got configure to work. build get this...http://pastebin.com/ezrX7CKy
[00:01] isaacs: garrettwilkin: you can use npm 1.0.106 with node 0.4
[00:01] garrettwilkin: I must be doing something horribly wrong
[00:01] isaacs: garrettwilkin: why wouldn't you be able to?
[00:01] garrettwilkin: okay
[00:01] garrettwilkin: i just didn't think I had to go that far back
[00:01] garrettwilkin: first I tried to make it work with 0.7
[00:01] garrettwilkin: and just made a huge mess and confused myself
[00:01] garrettwilkin: so i started over 
[00:01] garrettwilkin: with a node 0.6 install
[00:01] garrettwilkin: and install npm with the curl command
[00:02] garrettwilkin: and then thought maybe npm can downgrade itself?
[00:02] tenshihan: TooTallNate: found the problem nm
[00:02] TooTallNate: tenshihan: what was it?
[00:02] tenshihan: something between the keyboard and chair
[00:02] garrettwilkin: so i tried sudo npm install npm@1.0.103
[00:02] TooTallNate: :p
[00:03] remysharp: "createprocessW" on windows, any ideas anyone? kinda stuffed atm :-\
[00:03] itayneeman: isaacs: TooTallNate: thanks for the suggestions/help. I'll look into changing how Cover works based on what you said, as I think it can be greatly improved (and stabilized)
[00:03] itayneeman: any other suggestions/requests are always welcome
[00:03] itayneeman: isaacs: if there is a specific test framework you want me to make it work with, just let me know

[00:04] isaacs: garrettwilkin: curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | npm_install=1.0.106 sh
[00:04] itayneeman: isaacs: OK - would you like CLI output, or HTML output (or configurable)?
[00:04] isaacs: itayneeman: html dumped into --coverage-dir or some such
[00:04] garrettwilkin: I didn't see that there was a 1.0.106
[00:04] garrettwilkin: in the npm info npm
[00:04] garrettwilkin: thanks for the tip
[00:04] garrettwilkin: ill try downgrading to node 0.4  and then installing hook.io
[00:04] garrettwilkin: i guess that Nodejitsu is still on 0.4?
[00:05] isaacs: itayneeman: it's got some integration with runforcover already, but it's got some issues (documented on the issues list in github)
[00:05] itayneeman: isaacs: I'll take a look at the issues
[00:05] jxson has joined the channel

[00:06] itayneeman: I see just issue #27, yes?
[00:06] garrettwilkin: sweet!  didn't know that I could use that argument to specify the version
[00:06] garrettwilkin: thanks!
[00:09] itayneeman: isaacs: I'm not sure I understand the issue. runforcover will only read the files which you do require() on (it hooks into the .js extension)
[00:09] tenshihan: so i have a question. if i use a cpp extension it's faster than writing code in node, correct?
[00:09] tenshihan: my partner is attempting to argue the opposite
[00:10] jerrysv: tenshihan: depends
[00:10] jerrysv: tenshihan: if you do a lot of conversion back and forth between node and cpp, you lose anything you gain
[00:10] jerrysv: if you manage your own garbage collection, you can get a bit of a gain
[00:10] tenshihan: well let's say i send over some data have cpp do all the work and send it back. That's what'm going for
[00:11] jerrysv: but if you just run a very tight loop in javascript for 100000 loops, who knows? your javascript might end up being better in the end

[00:11] bingomanatee_: I know this seems basic -- how do you run forever from the console without having IT die when you log off?
[00:11] bingomanatee_: (ubuntu)
[00:12] Eruadan has joined the channel
[00:12] tenshihan: bingomanatee_: nohup command & 2>&1
[00:12] itayneeman: isaacs: in that sense, it'll do no more file reading than was already done (as even the original require hook needs to read those files in)
[00:12] bingomanatee_: thx
[00:12] c4milo has joined the channel
[00:14] isaacs: itayneeman: yeah, but look through the code.
[00:14] isaacs: itayneeman: it's doing a lot more file reading than it needs to.
[00:14] isaacs: it's not runforcover, it's the specifics of how its integrated into node-tap
[00:14] itayneeman: isaacs: the tap code, or the runforcover code?
[00:14] isaacs: itayneeman: the tap code
[00:14] itayneeman: isaacs: ah. here? https://github.com/isaacs/node-tap/blob/master/lib/tap-runner.js
[00:14] isaacs: teag
[00:14] isaacs: yeah
[00:15] isaacs: also a lot of it is sync, and it only works on files in lib/, etc.
[00:15] nibblebo_ has joined the channel
[00:15] itayneeman: isaacs: why only in lib/?

[00:16] teslan has joined the channel
[00:16] sdwrage has joined the channel
[00:16] isaacs: itayneeman: becasue it checks the folder to see if there are any files that *never* get loaded
[00:17] isaacs: itayneeman: but really, it should just not do that.
[00:17] itayneeman: isaacs: "it" being runforcover or tap?
[00:18] itayneeman: isaacs: also, tap spawns a new process per test file, is that right?
[00:18] jj0hns0n has joined the channel
[00:18] isaacs: itayneeman: the coverage stuf in tap
[00:18] isaacs: itayneeman: yes, the runner runs each test file in a new process.
[00:18] itayneeman: itayneeman: OK
[00:19] isaacs: itayneeman: if you're going to look into this, please don't re-invent the whole thing from scratch.
[00:19] shadowh511 has joined the channel
[00:19] itayneeman: isaacs: in what sense? I try and avoid doing that, but obviously people have different ideas
[00:19] isaacs: itayneeman: if you can fix the problems, great.  but the other bits, like how it generates a new file to load runforcover and then dump the results, that much is probably fine.
[00:20] isaacs: itayneeman: sync fs io is not allowed.  reading files unnecessarily is not allowed.  it must work in files in "." by default, not a subdire.
[00:20] isaacs: *subdir
[00:20] isaacs: other than that, taps coverage stuff is pretty good.
[00:20] isaacs: i don't care very much about pretty output.
[00:21] devaholic has joined the channel
[00:21] isaacs: i care much more about valid results with a minimum of overhead and a minimum of lines changed.
[00:21] itayneeman: isaacs: instrumentation seems to require lines changing, no?
[00:21] isaacs: itayneeman: yes.  so the minimum is likely greater than 0 :)

[00:22] itayneeman: isaacs: my fork was meant to solve a couple of things: 1. collect intra-line info (e.g. true || b() <-- want to know that b() wasn't executed). 2. collect block-level coverage info. 3. be able to see the data in a clear way. 4. generate correct code
[00:22] itayneeman: isaacs: I'll think about your issues
[00:22] itayneeman: but I think they may be tied up to how runforcover works

[00:29] isaacs: because i've done it, and showed it off to SubStack back in 2011, which is why he wrote Bunker.

[00:31] ningu: why do people prefer centos for web servers?
[00:32] ningu: I've never used centos, so I have no idea what it's like. most familiar with ubuntu and debian.
[00:32] iain_: ningu: no idea, centos/redhat is horrible
[00:32] isaacs: ningu: because they use rhel at work
[00:32] isaacs: ningu: but yes, it's pretty much the worst thing ever.
[00:32] ningu: isaacs: so my intuition to go with debian is not a bad one?
[00:32] CarterL has joined the channel
[00:32] ningu: I've always liked debian.
[00:32] isaacs: no, i much prefer debian
[00:32] ningu: ubuntu for desktop, perhaps.
[00:32] iain_: ningu: debian rocks for ease of use / upgrades
[00:32] isaacs: mint is nice, but i don't know how it is for servers.
[00:32] dreamdust: ACTION prefers Debian
[00:33] isaacs: ubuntu = ugly busted windows, mint = ugly busted mac os
[00:33] ningu: haha
[00:33] isaacs: so, slightly less ugly.
[00:33] isaacs: just as busted.
[00:33] iain_: lol
[00:33] isaacs: same debian craziness.
[00:33] ningu: I like ubuntu, actually. wouldn't use it by choice as my desktop env, but I wouldn't go crazy if I had it.
[00:33] isaacs: there's no desktop os anywhere near as nice as os x, imo
[00:33] ningu: maybe it's gone downhill, I dunno. haven't used it in a couple years.
[00:33] ningu: right, that's why I use os x :P
[00:34] ningu: I was so happy when os x came out, cause I already had been a mac person since I was little, but had been keeping random x86 boxes around for linux for years.

[00:39] dilvie: ningu: no, I'm not. Windows 7 is a solid OS with decent usability. It even has a better shell (powershell -- has OO piping, pretty badass, actually)

[01:04] Tobsn: you can start with 256mb thats 10 bucks a month
[01:04] Tobsn: because AWS has outages and the performance is way lower
[01:04] Tobsn: besides that rackspace cloud is way faster to set up
[01:04] Tobsn: AWS/Azure suck against rackspace cloud
[01:04] Tobsn: and we tried them inhouse here a lot
[01:04] Tobsn: you get more bang for the buck at rs
[01:05] Daegalus: well, reason being, being part of Bizspark, I get 2 free Small instances, or 1 medium

[01:06] Tobsn: azure is microsoft, i dont trust microsoft

[01:07] Tobsn: if you want solid hosting go with softlayer, if you need vm's go with rackspace cloud
[01:07] Tobsn: if you get shit for free, take the free shit
[01:07] Tobsn: :)
[01:08] Daegalus: i have no problems with microsoft. But anyways, this is a small time unimportant to the world project. Its mostly for a game, and its a build calculator for a game. Im designing it in HTML5/JS and Node.js and Im using Redis for data store. Just wanted to see my options
[01:08] Daegalus: but it seems redis does not have a official or stable Windows port, so Azure might be out

[02:09] unrob: Hi, I was hoping to get some help regarding the usage of accented characters with crypto.createHmac

[02:09] mikeal has joined the channel
[02:09] tjholowaychuk: AI42 just use an image tag.. lol
[02:09] tjholowaychuk: same as any other tag :p
[02:09] tmike: that sounds like a jade bug, if it doesn't put the space in.
[02:09] tjholowaychuk: if it doesn't work the path to your image is incorrect
[02:09] tmike: and if the space is required

[02:55] hermanjunge: another question since you are here

[02:55] hermanjunge: tail recursion
[02:55] shadowh511 has left the channel
[02:56] teslan has joined the channel
[02:56] hermanjunge: is really tail recursion, like erlang does?
[02:56] isaacs: here's the thing about tail recursion.
[02:56] isaacs: first, i'm going to tell you a little something about tail recursion.
[02:56] isaacs: then i'll tell you all about tail recursion.
[02:56] maxogden: ACTION rimshot
[02:56] hermanjunge: JAJAJJAJA
[02:56] hermanjunge: example
[02:56] isaacs: hermanjunge: no, there is no TCO in js
[02:56] SubStack: (tail (tail (tail (... recursion) ) ) )
[02:56] hermanjunge: loop() { doSomething(); setTimeout(loop, 1000); }
[02:57] isaacs: hermanjunge: but if you're doing stuff on nextTick or as a result of some async IO, then you'll drop the stack, which is a lot *like* tco
[02:57] hermanjunge: does it stack and clock my memory someday?
[02:57] isaacs: hermanjunge: no, because the timeout drops the stack
[02:57] isaacs: hermanjunge: but! that means you lose the return point as well.
[02:57] hermanjunge: so its safe to run it
[02:57] isaacs: hermanjunge: so, you can't return a value back 10 layers up.
[02:57] hermanjunge: for a main loop
[02:57] isaacs: hermanjunge: which *is* possible in erlang, scheme, etc.
[02:57] isaacs: oh, yeah, that's fine.
[02:57] isaacs: crockford dubbed that "eteration" once upon a time.
[02:57] ag4ve: there we go, killed my cpan tree and everything is good :)   back to code
[02:57] hermanjunge: the way one does in another languages do { doSomething(); waitOneSec(); } while(true)
[02:57] isaacs: the term didn't stick, but i liked it.
[02:58] isaacs: hermanjunge: right.
[02:58] hermanjunge: excellent
[02:58] isaacs: hermanjunge: that way is a lie, or a bad idea, or both.
[02:58] hermanjunge: I was doing a code, which was too procedural, and this do/while had me crazy
[02:58] isaacs: yep
[02:58] isaacs: you gotta chop it up for node
[02:58] hermanjunge: yep
[02:58] isaacs: which is kind of a good thing to do anyway for other reasons.
[02:59] hermanjunge: function One () { doSomething(); Two() }

[04:00] alejandromg: abhatnag: maybe not releated with your problem, but since you are defining a layout, you don't need to add  and extra html tag at index.jade

[04:01] rlidwka: shlevy: looks like nobody here use windows :)
[04:02] abhatnag: alejandromg: ah true enough, thanks
[04:02] abhatnag: shlevy: are there any specific console errors you see in windows?
[04:03] alejandromg: abhatnag: also, maybe the call to /api/soc, is timing out, add a log for it (on server.js) and see if the call is working 
[04:03] shlevy: abhatnag: Nope. No errors or anything, just nothing is sent from the server after the first non-static request

[04:08] abhatnag: alejandromg: I think the res.end() is in place; the same setup works without jade, in normal html. I have a feeling the problem is with jQuery's methods acting on jade...somehow, if that makes sense
[04:09] abhatnag: shlevy: not sure, are you sure your versions of node etc are exactly the same on both OSes. Also when you run a server instance on Windows, the console shows nothing? and does the frontend return a message?
[04:09] tmcw has joined the channel
[04:09] alejandromg: abhatnag: I don't think so, since the render action happen before requiring the create.js file (which is required when the page start to load in browser
[04:09] tmcw: Does anyone have experience using dtrace or oprofile with node?
[04:09] shlevy: abhatnag: Everything's the same. Frontend doesn't return a message, just keeps trying to load. The console log shows the same in both versions.

[04:47] hermanjunge: exacty
[04:47] hermanjunge: you don't need express to everything
[04:48] tmike: I'm building a pastebin/sprunge.us clone that uses express and couchdb
[04:48] wizard_2: monokrome: yea - I actually just want to implement a filter stream, to transform data on it's way though, it looks like I need to impliment write() and emit data
[04:48] alexmcpherson has joined the channel

[05:01] alexmcpherson: People'll write adapters maybe :-/
[05:02] justicefries: yeah
[05:02] justicefries: I wonder if Tower.Model will need to be extended when it attempts the connection.
[05:02] justicefries: and if it's using an AST or just "hai node-mongodb-native"
[05:03] justicefries: that sort of stuff I didn't check out.
[05:03] justicefries: and tower 2.0 we'll probably have mountables. ;) mount express on tower...now I'm just being railsy.

[05:08] hermanjunge: thx isaacs
[05:09] justicefries: alexmcpherson: one thing is the general rejection of mega-things like Rails, and a lot of backlash recently.
[05:09] tmike: So can you use npm to install from a folder and have it install the dependencies too?
[05:09] isaacs[away]: hermanjunge: the second arg to url.parse tells it whether to parse the query string, too

[05:10] hermanjunge: or do npm install express
[05:10] hermanjunge: sometimes you need to sudo

[05:11] Eruadan: hi, I would like to know how could i use now.js with knockout.js . Do you know any info about these 2 playing togheter?
[05:11] isaacs: npm installs stuff into the local prefix dir

[05:12] hermanjunge: and solved that way
[05:12] tmike: I've seen it too, where a broken permission in ~/.npm breaks npm install
[05:13] hermanjunge: then I learned to do chown -r <hermanjunge:staff> ~/.npm
[05:13] hermanjunge: and everything went fine

[05:46] jesusabdullah: sure there are idiots using macs
[05:46] jesusabdullah: but there are also idiots using windows
[05:47] jesusabdullah: linux has enough gotchas that it keeps some dumb people out, but they're still around
[05:48] jesusabdullah: I think maybe it feels that way with macs because it's a good development platform that doesn't have the same learning curve as linux
[05:48] jesusabdullah: and by "good" I mean that non-VS development works well
[05:48] Sensible: If I need information on Perl, C#/ASP.NET, php, or Java, there are plenty of online resources. For Node.js, there's practically nothing. If node is so awesome, then why isn't there any documentation?

[05:49] Sensible: thnx
[05:50] jesusabdullah: Because the cpu is often not your bottleneck, and there are many strategies for scaling across cores that don't involve threads (processes for example)
[05:50] justicefries: wait.
[05:50] justicefries: Sensible, I don't mean to jump you here, but I'm going to.
[05:50] jesusabdullah: Also, a language isn't single-core, a runtime is
[05:51] jesusabdullah: and for that matter, there are in fact threads in node, just not in the main js runtime
[05:51] Sensible: justicefries: I’m a huge bargain for my market value. I’m at the top end of the ability scale, with productivity 10x or 100x higher than most.

[05:53] jesusabdullah: unless you're using npm.
[05:53] jesusabdullah: Then it's unicorns and rainbows.
[05:53] justicefries: ignoring npm, I'm talking more apt versus homebrew.
[05:53] jesusabdullah: I hear brew's alright (usually)
[05:53] justicefries: npm is good. :D
[05:53] Sensible: He had the “abused productive” personality type and should have known better than to be fooled by hype.  However, the psychopath-in-training “idea guy” may have emotionally bullied him into using node.js.  It’s extremely pathetic that someone with an MIT CS PhD doesn’t actually write code, because it’s “beneath him”.
[05:53] justicefries: homebrew is under this crazy impression you need to compile everything.
[05:53] jesusabdullah: who's "he" ?
[05:53] Sensible: justicefries: Xcode drives me insane.
[05:54] ningu: justicefries: there has never been a good binary distro for os x. I have no idea why.

[05:54] Sensible: One co-founder had a Harvard MBA, which translates into English as “I’m a retard.”  However, he was intelligent and had the “abused productive” personality type.  Actually, that’s a bad sign.  If the non-technical cofounders have the “abused productive” personality type, then they almost definitely hired parasites and psychopaths to implement the website for them.
[05:54] jesusabdullah: a co-founder of what?
[05:55] justicefries: ningu: homebrew is nice to use comparatively.
[05:55] Sensible: jesusabdullah: This node.js start-up I interviewed at today.
[05:55] hermanjunge: WHAT?
[05:55] hermanjunge: Who is the devil here?
[05:55] hermanjunge: (I've just catched up)
[05:55] justicefries: ningu: I've just had enough of fighting and I'm not rabid enough about my OS to want to fight it anymore. :/
[05:55] Sensible: hermanjunge: Stupid people are evil.
[05:55] ningu: justicefries: I don't blame you. it depends what packages you need to work with.
[05:55] jesusabdullah: I think a Harvard MBA is less an indicator of stupidity and more an indicator of having perceived privelege
[05:55] ningu: but linux distros have much better package management
[05:56] justicefries: ningu: I also understand the problem. nobody wants to build and maintain binary packages, because you COULD do it with homebrew, technically, it's just not how it's done.
[05:56] justicefries: yeah
[05:56] jesusabdullah: That is, a degree from Harvard isn't actually worth much more than any other degree, if at all, but people *think* it does---ESPECIALLY the people that have them
[05:56] Sensible: jesusabdullah: right
[05:57] hermanjunge: At least is a HArvard MBA
[05:57] jesusabdullah: as far as MBAs go, it *really* depends. Like, I could get an MBA right now and my background's in engineering. If someone with a business degree got an MBA, even though we'd both have MBAs their attitudes and style would be vastly different
[05:57] hermanjunge: The top university is my country is ranked 200 something in the world
[05:57] jesusabdullah: from the hypothetical "jesusabdullah with an MBA"
[05:57] hermanjunge: and their graduates see themselves as top notch people
[05:57] hermanjunge: jesusabdullah you have an M.S.
[05:57] hermanjunge: LOL
[05:58] jesusabdullah: I think an MBA should be seen more like an uber-minor than like a degree in and of itself

[05:58] hermanjunge: With a fancy title thesis
[05:58] jesusabdullah: that wishes scala had libuv bindings ;)
[05:58] justicefries: that said, you just compared languages that have had 15+ years of development efforts put into them.
[05:58] justicefries: versus one that is barely a fifth of that old.
[05:58] justicefries: and all its time is going into development.
[05:58] jesusabdullah: bind libuv to ALL the things!
[05:58] justicefries: I wouldn't consider available docs out there a valid comparison for awesomeness.
[05:58] Sensible: justicefries: Just angry at abused productives right now.
[05:58] justicefries: fair.
[05:59] jesusabdullah: Sensible: So, this douchebag with an MBA is like, "node.js is a buzzword we're using that" and the other co-founder's like, "I'm a pussy so I'm gonna roll with it" ?
[05:59] justicefries: Sensible: I think node.js is a tool, I met a guy using node.js and was learning it because it's the rage. using something like that 'just because' is not the right conclusion.
[05:59] jesusabdullah: I mean, node.js is a great fit for a lot of problems, but you shouldn't pick it for the buzzwords.
[05:59] justicefries: so, I think you ran into idiots.
[06:00] jesusabdullah: I agree.
[06:00] justicefries: ie you may want to use netty over node.
[06:00] justicefries: depending.
[06:00] jesusabdullah: I'm glad we could have this talk.
[06:00] jesusabdullah: Sensible: Tell me about scala.
[06:00] justicefries: also, <3 clojure, so.
[06:00] jesusabdullah: (someday I'm going to learn me some clojure, maybe)
[06:01] jesusabdullah: justicefries: So, do you know what the cool java libraries are?
[06:01] justicefries: I think it makes me a rich hickey apologist.
[06:01] jesusabdullah: cause, like, honestly, that's my barometer for "what I want to work with"
[06:01] jesusabdullah: is the number of neat libraries that let me do cool things
[06:01] Sensible: jesusabdullah: If you have the intelligent personality type, you love Scala (if you've tried it). If you have the parasitic personality type, you hate Scala.
[06:01] jesusabdullah: or, at least, the potential for cool things
[06:01] meso has joined the channel
[06:01] jesusabdullah: I'm not sure intelligence is a personality type? XD
[06:01] justicefries: Java has a huge number of libraries all across the board, you can do some super cool stuff.
[06:02] justicefries: StanfordNLP, for example, is something just nonexistent in Node.
[06:02] jesusabdullah: NLP you say?
[06:02] justicefries: clojure + natural language processing, it's pretty natural given a LISP and NLP.
[06:02] jesusabdullah: THIS INTERESTS ME
[06:02] justicefries: versus Java, where it's not AS natural.
[06:02] justicefries: you can build a DSL around that NLP.
[06:02] jesusabdullah: Interesting
[06:02] jesusabdullah: I'm always kinda amazed when I hear you can use clojure with a java library and not have it feel funky/hackneyed
[06:02] justicefries: I want to actually build a full DSL for NLP libraries, where you can drop any of the main ones in.
[06:02] justicefries: yeah.
[06:02] justicefries: it's natural.
[06:03] justicefries: it's very first class, compared to Scala (from what I hear about Scala)
[06:03] jesusabdullah: Do you know of any good math libraries for java?
[06:03] justicefries: Math. :)
[06:03] jesusabdullah: Before I did node I did a lot of numpy/scipy stuff
[06:03] justicefries: oh.
[06:03] jesusabdullah: by "math" I mean matrices
[06:03] jesusabdullah: algorithms
[06:04] justicefries: yeah
[06:04] justicefries: <3 numpy/scipy, but..
[06:04] purr: Let it be known that justicefries hearts numpy/scipy, but...

[06:04] jesusabdullah: matlib?
[06:04] jesusabdullah: my googling turns up matlab
[06:05] Sensible: I got fired! I was slightly worried, because I could tell the new boss was trash-talking me behind my back. Still, I couldn't believe they were that stupid! I was the only one getting any work done! I was doing bugfixes in their old Java system, while the Rails people were spinning their wheels and wasting time.
[06:05] jesusabdullah: and to my knowledge numpy uses lapack and blas
[06:05] Sensible:  I assumed that would continue for a few more months, until they realized the Rails project was a disaster (or I found a new job).
[06:05] justicefries: mm blas.
[06:05] jesusabdullah: Sensible: sounds frustrating
[06:05] justicefries: OH.

[06:06] justicefries: er, that's C.
[06:06] Sensible: After I left, two of the marketing owners came out to say goodbye. They asked me what went wrong. They did seem genuinely concerned that their $500M business opportunity is being flushed down the toilet. I told them to give me a call if they're ever serious about running a software company.

[06:08] itayneeman: jesusabdullah: in lift's defense, they had it before node.js existed, I believe :)
[06:08] justicefries: actually jesusabdullah I wanted to talk to you about that.
[06:09] justicefries: now.js is used in some examples.
[06:09] jesusabdullah: itayneeman: Definitely not implying they "totally ripped us off maaan"
[06:09] jesusabdullah: itayneeman: More like, "Hey we like the same things"
[06:09] itayneeman: jesusabdullah: yeah, i know. It's actually funny how long this has been used as the example :)
[06:09] Sensible: jesusabdullah: Hello world is a bad sign. :(

[06:09] jesusabdullah: note the quotes
[06:09] jesusabdullah: -heh- that rhymes
[06:10] itayneeman: :)
[06:10] justicefries: and I was thinking about a pretty common pattern for desktop/mobile apps - event emitters. It seems like it'd be a pretty sane approach to have a client/server emitter object that both sides can bind and send events on.
[06:10] justicefries: with data on those events.
[06:10] justicefries: and I don't know of anything like it at the moment.

[06:10] jesusabdullah: I guess it was inevitable
[06:10] abraxas: can i get some advice from an experienced c++ addon developer by any chance? :)
[06:11] jesusabdullah: any c++ side peeps in the house?
[06:11] abraxas: lol
[06:11] justicefries: I can talk about C++ but not as it relates to addons. :)
[06:11] abraxas: you too?
[06:11] jesusabdullah: hah
[06:11] abraxas: heh
[06:11] jesusabdullah: abraxas: That was mostly me signalling that when it comes to writing binary addons I'm clueless
[06:12] jesusabdullah: abraxas: one thing about node that's kinda lame right now is that the c++ side of things is woefully underdocumented
[06:12] abraxas: right, i'm just starting, but i need some serious advice regarding libuv
[06:12] abraxas: yeah, exactly
[06:12] ningu: I still want to know why it's called libuv
[06:12] jesusabdullah: abraxas: "Documentation: See lib/uv.h" "Did you just tell me to fuck myself?"
[06:12] abraxas: jesusabdullah: i believe so ;)
[06:12] jesusabdullah: ningu: I thin kit's a play on libev

[06:13] jesusabdullah: I almost feel bad for ocaml
[06:14] jesusabdullah: like, it's a functional language that's actually proven itself
[06:14] jesusabdullah: like, fftw and unison are written in ocaml
[06:14] justicefries: fftw is!?
[06:14] jesusabdullah: hell yeah
[06:15] jesusabdullah: last I checked anyway
[06:15] jesusabdullah: feel free to look it up and yell at me if I'm full of shit
[06:15] justicefries: I thought it was C.
[06:15] justicefries: we're talking about the fourier transform library right?
[06:15] abraxas: jesusabdullah: i'm trying to wrap a library that relies heavily on sockets and its events... i'm having a lot of trouble integrating that with libuv, which with its streams follows a different flow than that library i'm using
[06:15] jesusabdullah: http://www.fftw.org/faq/section2.html#languages
[06:16] justicefries: oh, damn.
[06:16] abraxas: jesusabdullah: add to that, that i'm pretty green with libuv and you have a painful situation :/ grmbl
[06:16] justicefries: well, OKAY then.
[06:16] jesusabdullah: So, you could say I was wrong because, well, you use the C code but it's *generated* with ocaml
[06:16] justicefries: that's good enough. :)
[06:16] jesusabdullah: abraxas: I've heard that the code's actually pretty well laid out if you don't mind reading source code for a while
[06:17] jesusabdullah: Like, even though the "documentation" is kind of a "fuck you" I hear it's actually not that bad
[06:17] abraxas: jesusabdullah: it is, it just follows a flow that kinda conflicts with what i have to implement 
[06:17] jesusabdullah: y'know, if you're comfortable with c++
[06:17] jesusabdullah: oh, yeah, that happens
[06:17] jesusabdullah: I'd help you if I could but unfortunately I'm a c++ noob
[06:17] abraxas: jesusabdullah: it's an api problem more than a language problem
[06:17] justicefries: note: c++ sucks, use c.
[06:17] abraxas: jesusabdullah: (but the language doesn't help)
[06:18] abraxas: libuv is c btw, not c++

[15:05] heavyUser: hello, im having a little trouble with node
[15:05] heavyUser: it's the setTimeout function
[15:05] heavyUser: it returns an object instead of a numberic id
[15:05] criswell has joined the channel
[15:05] heavyUser: why is that?
[15:05] socketio\test\56 has joined the channel
[15:06] heavyUser: i need to save that numeric id into a database for later possible cancellation, but how? i cant get it
[15:06] DavidIAm: that doesn't sound like a realistically serializable situation.
[15:07] heavyUser: nodes documentation is all about returning a numeric id
[15:07] DavidIAm: Perhaps storing a unique guid or such in the closure that is the function run by the timeout and checking for revocation in the database would be a more likely strategy to succeed in more cases?
[15:07] heavyUser: (like javascriptn on the browser does)
[15:08] heavyUser: i will consider that strategy, but im also pointing out, that the manual is therefor misleading
[15:09] DavidIAm: indeed.  The latest manual does not mention such a behavior.
[15:09] rummik: Interesting O.o
[15:09] DavidIAm: have you done an inspect of this object?
[15:09] jdeibele has joined the channel

[15:11] rummik: Yeah
[15:11] DavidIAm: can you serialize it though?
[15:11] AvianFlu: if you put timers into an array, you can access those references later, i.e. clearTimeout(timers[5])
[15:11] joshfinnie has joined the channel
[15:11] AvianFlu: or an object, or whatever
[15:11] DavidIAm: if its an object, can you timers[5].clear()?
[15:11] Aiden has joined the channel
[15:11] AvianFlu: I think you have to use the global clearTimeout() function
[15:12] AvianFlu: I don't know if it has a method like that, but I also don't know

[15:12] rummik: clearTimeout() does indeed work, however
[15:12] AvianFlu: yep
[15:12] AvianFlu: that's what the returned ref is for
[15:12] fairwinds: hi, interested in uploading to cloudfiles as stream without building file on server first, anyone aware of a solution already available
[15:12] DavidIAm: Its just not a particularly serializable object like the number referred to in the documentation.
[15:12] rummik: Still, odd that it doesn't pass a number
[15:12] infynyxx has joined the channel
[15:12] yawNO has joined the channel
[15:13] DavidIAm: (it does seem a little odd to be serializing a runtime-dynamic value though)
[15:13] heavyUser: so im gonna generate my own numeric id to store in a database, set the timeout on an object with the key i just generated and woila i have it
[15:13] rummik: Tried throwing a .toString() on the end, didn't give anything useful
[15:13] _rockbot_ has joined the channel
[15:13] DavidIAm: if the program dies, the id in the db could be recycled by a new instance, for a diff purpose, clearing the timeout could be catastrophic.
[15:13] heavyUser: didnt count for that
[15:14] DavidIAm: ACTION has noticed a pattern of ignoring state persistance in nodejs programming at his workplace too.  Interesting pattern.
[15:14] benvie: WeakMaps can use objects as keys
[15:15] benvie: in fact require that
[15:15] DavidIAm: Perhaps a global object can retain your dynamic state for use later in your program run.  Writing it out externally brings up issues.

[15:19] benvie: weakmap.set(objKey, value) returns the value so it's convenient
[15:19] DavidIAm: but can you create a new object
[15:19] DavidIAm: that is identical in keys and values
[15:19] DavidIAm: and reference the value in question?
[15:20] johnhamelink: Inter-module communication: what is the best way to do it, potentially en masse?
[15:20] benvie: return secrets.has(this) ? secrets.get(this) : secrets.set(this, someDefault)
[15:20] benvie: no
[15:20] benvie: javascript objects have globally unique ids
[15:20] benvie: you can't spoof it

[15:20] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[15:20] pendlepants has joined the channel
[15:20] benvie: it's using a random hash inside the vm that's inaccessible from js
[15:20] benvie: no two objects have the same identity
[15:21] DavidIAm: benvie - so it only gives you access to values related to objects you already have.  Like a secondary secret store.
[15:21] benvie: exactly!
[15:21] benvie: that's a key feature of weakmaps
[15:21] benvie: you can use it to pass revokable references and some cool stuff
[15:21] benvie: you can store data about external objects without alterting them
[15:21] benvie: say you want to tag every object in the entire scope
[15:21] DavidIAm: benvie - interesting to say the least.
[15:22] benvie: you can do secretcache.set(eachObject, mySecretValue)
[15:22] benvie: so external private data
[15:22] DavidIAm: once again, only useful within a particular process though.
[15:22] benvie: it automatically overrights like any hash does so it's also guranteed unique
[15:22] benvie: yeah
[15:23] heavyUser: thats the sad part yeah
[15:23] DavidIAm: I been working in stateless web programming for so long the very idea of features like that makes me boggle.
[15:23] benvie: you'd need some sort of guid tagging system to go cross process

[15:24] Fuu has joined the channel

[15:24] benvie: since the weakmap is a kind of blackbox it eliminates cyclic references that keep objects alive when nothing outside would otherwise keep them alive

[15:30] benvie: not serialized

[15:30] benvie: node-ffi allows you to write pointers of js objects
[15:30] dleary has joined the channel
[15:30] benvie: now this crashed node if you try to do it cross process
[15:31] benvie: you can't transplant objects across the boundary

[15:32] benvie: exception I believe, it was v8
[15:32] heavyUser_: lets suggest the core team to find a solution for serializing a timeout id

[17:52] kickingvegas has joined the channel
[17:52] isaacs: smf: sha1 hashing is tricky to do in js.
[17:52] smf: oh
[17:52] isaacs: smf: but i think the browserid guys did some stuff with that.
[17:52] isaacs: smf: there are some js libs, but they're not going to be quite as fast as the crypto binding in node that uses libssl
[17:52] smf: maybe node.js is better for simple stuff and not serve complex stuff that does caulcation?
[17:53] omni5cience has joined the channel

[18:17] ben_alman: isaacs: remember we were talking aobut plugins the other day? well i want to be able to manually load a global npm module if it exists
[18:17] ben_alman: instead of auto-loading it
[18:18] ben_alman: but i don't want to just require the plugin, i need to get a subfolder within it
[18:18] ben_alman: so, given an npm module name, i need the path where that module lives
[18:18] DeepEd has joined the channel
[18:20] ben_alman: isaacs: in what cases would npm.load ever error?
[18:21] isaacs: ben_alman: it does a bunch of file io
[18:21] isaacs: ben_alman: why not just do `require.resolve("blah")`?
[18:21] ben_alman: that works with global npm modules?
[18:22] isaacs: ben_alman: no, but require() doesn't work with global npm modules, either :)
[18:22] ben_alman: right
[18:22] ben_alman: so i'm going to make it work
[18:22] isaacs: ben_alman: nor should it
[18:22] isaacs: why?  that's a terrible idea.
[18:22] DavidIAm has left the channel
[18:22] isaacs: you're resurrecting the problems we solved in node 0.4 and npm 1.0
[18:22] ben_alman: the tool is going to be installed globally
[18:22] sdqali has joined the channel
[18:22] ben_alman: and as suck its plugins should be installed globally
[18:22] ben_alman: lol suck
[18:22] ben_alman: such
[18:23] isaacs: ben_alman: no, you were right the first time.
[18:23] isaacs: ;P
[18:23] ben_alman: i see no problems here
[18:23] isaacs: then it'll be able to require() its plugins
[18:23] isaacs: the global space is like a single local space
[18:23] isaacs: but it's isolated from the local spaces just as they're isolated from one another.
[18:23] isaacs: this is on purpose, and wonderful.
[18:23] ben_alman: it's a tool whose bin goes into the path
[18:23] isaacs: right
[18:23] astrostl has joined the channel
[18:23] ben_alman: and is used across projects
[18:24] hipsterslapfight has joined the channel
[18:24] ben_alman: the plugins are also used across projects
[18:24] ben_alman: so it's all global
[18:24] ben_alman: kinda like anything you'd install into /usr somewhere
[18:24] ben_alman: it just happens to use npm as its package manager
[18:25] ben_alman: just because it's written in javascript doesn't mean it can't be a globally accessible cli tool with plugins that are also globally accessible
[18:25] ben_alman: now, plugins *can* be installed locally
[18:25] ben_alman: but it's not required
[18:25] awkn4n has left the channel
[18:26] ben_alman: isaacs: so will path.join(npm.globalPrefix, 'lib/node_modules') work on all OSes ?

[18:27] isaacs: ben_alman: use path.resove.
[18:27] isaacs: path.resolve
[18:27] ben_alman: k
[18:27] isaacs: also, you can just use `npm.globalDir`
[18:27] isaacs: since, no, it won't work on all OS'es, since win32 doesn't get a "lib/" there.
[18:27] Onkeltem has joined the channel

[18:28] isaacs: ben_alman: again, i must impress upon you, you are heading in a terrible direction.

[18:28] ben_alman: can you elaborate?
[18:28] ben_alman: FUD alone is not enough
[18:28] _th_n has joined the channel
[18:28] HardFu: damn
[18:28] HardFu: [object Object] on error thrown
[18:28] isaacs: ben_alman: the folder structure of npm's global space is a private API.  it's an implementation detail.  you are not supposed to touch it, and i won't ask permission to change it out from under you.
[18:29] isaacs: (point #1) 
[18:29] HardFu: how can i get what's in the object
[18:29] isaacs: #2) there's a reason why local dependencies are great: depending on the state of the global space is deeply problematic.
[18:29] Onkeltem: I'm exporing NPM and what it does and how it does. When I type `npm ls` to get the list of instaled modules, it lists nothing. But in /usr/lib/node_modules  there are at least 3 of them. Why?
[18:29] isaacs: we learned this with gems, with npm 0.x, and so on.
[18:29] ben_alman: isaacs: when you use "node" on the command line, you depend on it being installed correctly
[18:29] isaacs: Onkeltem: because you've installed things globally, not locally.
[18:29] ben_alman: in a global space
[18:29] isaacs: Onkeltem: npm faq <-- read this
[18:30] Onkeltem: isaacs: yes, this was the first though, so I ran it with sudo :)
[18:30] Onkeltem: isaacs: thanks, I'll do

[18:31] isaacs: ben_alman: don't make more of these types of things.
[18:31] jacksonmills has joined the channel
[18:31] RLa: it seems to be heavily object-oriented
[18:31] isaacs: ben_alman: as the maintainer of one of the most widely used global npm modules, i can assure you, pain awaits at the end of this road.
[18:31] Onkeltem: Is there a browsable list of packages yet?
[18:31] jacksonmills: oh hai everyone. Just q uick question; does anyone know off the top of their head if v8, the core v8, implements "require" or if that's something that only node does ( i.e., does V8 implement CommonJS ? )
[18:32] ben_alman: npm has built in a mechanism for allowing modules to create globally accessible bin scripts that are put in the users' path
[18:32] broofa_ has joined the channel
[18:32] ben_alman: how can you allow that and then say "oh but don't make anything global"
[18:32] isaacs: ben_alman: because npm itself needs this in order to function.
[18:32] isaacs: ben_alman: if something is global, don't try to make it ALSO local, that's what i'm saying.
[18:32] ben_alman: what about jshint for example, it has a bin script
[18:32] isaacs: ben_alman: global modules should be run as their cli script, and then that's it.
[18:32] ben_alman: wait, i'm not making anything "also local"
[18:32] addisonj: whats the problem with installing it once locally and once globally?
[18:32] jacksonmills: issacs: Do you know?
[18:33] ben_alman: this is intended to be run via cli entirely
[18:33] RLa: jacksonmills, i think it's from node
[18:33] isaacs: ben_alman: if they're used locally, they should be run from ./node_modules/.bin/whatever, like when you run tap or vows via `npm test`
[18:33] Onkeltem: isaacs: `npm faq` rocks!
[18:33] jacksonmills: RLa: thx, do you know if node creates its own static precompiled lib? like does it have its own flavor of v8?
[18:33] isaacs: jacksonmills: require() is node-only
[18:33] ben_alman: this whole thing is global
[18:33] ben_alman: it's intalled via -g
[18:33] jacksonmills: aka a v8.a just for node?
[18:33] isaacs: jacksonmills: read through ./src/node.js and ./lib/module.js in node's source tree
[18:33] jacksonmills: ok
[18:33] ben_alman: i'm not sure where you got the "local" bit from
[18:33] jacksonmills: thanks isaacs 
[18:34] isaacs: ben_alman: then why do you need to iterate through npm's global space?
[18:34] RLa: jacksonmills, i think there are some js files compiled into node binary
[18:34] StanlySoManly1 has joined the channel
[18:34] isaacs: ben_alman: why not just read path.resolve(__dirname, "..")?
[18:34] isaacs: (even then, packages should stay in their boxes)
[18:34] rekon has joined the channel
[18:34] ben_alman: the tool is global. it can conditionally load 3rd party plugins that are also global, depending on how it's used. they aren't dependencies, because they are entirely optional and maintained by other people
[18:35] ben_alman: it's like inside a perl script shelling out and running ruby or anything else
[18:35] ben_alman: except not so dirty
[18:35] isaacs: ben_alman: then why not let users add plugins by doing something like: `bentool addplugin foo`, which then runs `npm install bentool-foo` in a child process, locally, so it's right there in your local node_modules folder?
[18:36] gaarf has joined the channel
[18:36] ben_alman: that's like telling the user of a makefile to install gcc locally
[18:36] shadowshell has joined the channel
[18:36] RLa: btw, what you guys think about this pattern: module.exports = SingleFunction ?
[18:36] isaacs: ben_alman: are any of your plugins anywhere near the complexity, scope, or size of gcc?
[18:36] isaacs: RLa: use that all the time.  <3 it.
[18:37] ben_alman: isaacs: things inevitably get more complex
[18:37] RLa: oh, it seems pretty common in cloud9 too
[18:37] ben_alman: this is meant to be a generic global plugin loading system for a global cli-run module
[18:37] isaacs: ben_alman: it is our job to fight to contain that complexity, not look for new exciting ways to spew it all over everywhere.
[18:37] chjj has joined the channel
[18:38] ben_alman: the tool is only as complex as it needs to be
[18:38] isaacs: ben_alman: if you install your plugins locally in the root project, then they go away with you when i uninstall the tool.
[18:38] tmike: ben_alman: tools are often much more complex than they need to be

[18:38] ben_alman: ok
[18:38] ben_alman: gotcha.
[18:39] isaacs: your tool has to work whether it's local, or global, or copied and pasted or rsynced etc.
[18:39] isaacs: or just a random git checkout
[18:39] ben_alman: well, someone else's tool, not mine, but continue

[18:39] isaacs: for the sake of this discussion, let's call it yours.
[18:39] ben_alman: let's not.
[18:39] isaacs: what is it?
[18:39] ben_alman: the reason i created a tool installed globally via npm was to avoid having it be a part of every project
[18:40] isaacs: ben_alman: what is the actual thing?
[18:40] ben_alman: which was extremely cumbersome
[18:40] ben_alman: grunt
[18:40] isaacs: ben_alman: what's it called?
[18:40] redir has joined the channel
[18:40] isaacs: ok, so you install grunt globally.
[18:40] isaacs: then you want to add a plugin to grunt.
[18:40] Hebo has joined the channel
[18:40] isaacs: so you run `grunt addplugin grunt-foo`
[18:40] isaacs: cli bikeshedding notwithstanding.
[18:40] ben_alman: ya
[18:41] ben_alman: more like `npm install -g grunt-foo`
[18:41] isaacs: no.
[18:41] ben_alman: otherwise it adds a lot more complexity into grunt
[18:41] isaacs: you have some way to modify the grunt source code.
[18:42] isaacs: grunt *can't see anything outside its folder*
[18:42] misza222 has joined the channel
[18:42] isaacs: why?  because it's installed as "nobody" and "root" owns that folder, and has chmodded it 0700
[18:42] joe__k has joined the channel
[18:42] isaacs: and i run grunt as my local user, not as root
[18:42] joe__k: sweet, mocha 0.13 seemed to fix all my context/before issues
[18:42] bradleymeck: don't modify source just make grunt have a config file of which plugins to load, then pull in the plugins dynamically from the grunt global directory, don't make peer dependencies if they are plugins for a system
[18:42] ben_alman: the user will be able to tell grunt to point to an arbitrary location to load additional stuff from
[18:43] isaacs: what is grunt?
[18:43] isaacs: something you've installed with npm?
[18:43] ben_alman: yes
[18:43] NetRoY has joined the channel
[18:43] ben_alman: bradleymeck: but i need to allow users to write plugins that aren't part of grunt directly, because it would be difficult to maintain all that
[18:43] ben_alman: so they can maintain their plugins and i maintain grunt
[18:43] isaacs: if it has a plugin api, why is it adding undue complexity to ask grunt to give you a way to load plugins?
[18:43] Onkeltem: (reading faq) Oh, I'd broken the rule of not-capitalizing npm when joint here. Sorry for that ;-)
[18:43] KrisJordan has joined the channel
[18:44] isaacs: Onkeltem: it's ok :)
[18:44] isaacs: that's mostly a joek
[18:44] ben_alman: isaacs: it doesn't have a "plugin" api, it has a "load extra stuff from an arbitrary folder" api
[18:44] ben_alman: and that extra stuff could be .. in a globally installed npm module
[18:44] bradleymeck: ben_alman just make a directory in the global grun install that keeps a list of all things installed via `grunt install`
[18:45] isaacs: ben_alman: why don't you write a grunt-plugins tool in npm, and tell grunt to load plugins from that thing's node_modules folder.
[18:45] isaacs: ben_alman: again: this is cli bikeshedding.
[18:45] yawNO_ has joined the channel
[18:45] isaacs: ben_alman: so you run `gruntp add-plugin grunt-foo`
[18:45] RiverraiD has joined the channel
[18:45] ben_alman: isaacs: this is assuming i have the bandwidth to write a plugins management system
[18:45] isaacs: ben_alman: then grunt loads everhting in ../grung-plugins/node_modules
[18:46] bradleymeck: ben_alman just use something like broadway if you want a simple plugin system
[18:46] isaacs: ben_alman: you're writing one right now, but going down this extremely brittle path.
[18:46] ben_alman: but i'm not really
[18:46] isaacs: ben_alman: i'm trying to show you the paved sidewalk
[18:46] ben_alman: yeah but i'm clearly not getting it
[18:46] ben_alman: i see your concern
[18:46] ben_alman: and i'm trying to talk through all this
[18:46] jnbek has joined the channel

[18:46] isaacs: sure
[18:46] tylerstalder has joined the channel
[18:47] sdwrage has joined the channel
[18:47] bradleymeck: ben_alman i guess what we are having trouble with is, why does it need to be global? why cant you have something like grunt.json that lists what node_modules to load and attach? then `grunt add-plugin` would just be diverting to npm install
[18:47] isaacs: the problem is that you'er relying on a private API and a naming convention
[18:47] bradleymeck: global installs are nightmares if 2 versions are ever ever needed
[18:47] isaacs: what is grunt, anyway?
[18:47] ben_alman: task-based js build tool
[18:47] chapel: isaacs: a build tool
[18:47] isaacs: oic, it's like jake or whatever.
[18:48] hermanjunge: isaacs Hi
[18:48] ben_alman: kinda, but with lots predefined
[18:48] ben_alman: because jake is just the tasks
[18:48] ben_alman: er
[18:48] ben_alman: just the framework
[18:48] ben_alman: this has a lot of very commonly used tasks built-in
[18:48] hermanjunge: isaacs: Besides node-inspector, do you suggest or recommend other tool?
[18:48] yawNO has joined the channel
[18:48] hermanjunge: other than console.log() like crazy
[18:48] ben_alman: i started by writing ridiculously complicated jakefiles and realized that maintaining the same huge jakefile across dozens of projects wasn't going to work
[18:49] ben_alman: so i decided to build a tool
[18:49] isaacs: ben_alman: sure, sounds reasonable.
[18:49] ben_alman: so the whole idea was to make it install globally so all i'd need is a grunt.js config file per-project
[18:49] ben_alman: then people wanted to add plugins
[18:49] ben_alman: and i didn't want to write a plugin management system
[18:50] ben_alman: so i figured.. what's easy? well the user wants to make their own tasks in grunt-foo installed globally, i can jsut load that along with the built-in tasks
[18:50] ben_alman: and super simple, i get my tool, they get their extensions, win
[18:50] isaacs: ben_alman: what if i *want* to install grunt locally, and then run `grunt do-stuff` in my package.json prepublish script, so that it gets loaded from ./node_modules/.bin
[18:51] ben_alman: that works fine too. you can even run it in JS
[18:51] isaacs: right.
[18:51] ben_alman: wait idea
[18:51] isaacs: but if grunt tries to read the global install space, then that'll fail.
[18:51] ben_alman: idea!
[18:51] isaacs: *especially* if it assumes that everything named grunt-blah is a plugin.
[18:51] isaacs: !!!! :)
[18:51] whaley has joined the channel
[18:52] ben_alman: what if, when you specify an grunt-foo npm module in grunt, it loads ../grunt-foo relative to where grunt was installed
[18:52] ben_alman: so if grunt was local, it's local. if grunt was global, it's global
[18:52] isaacs: ben_alman: or just require("grunt-foo")
[18:52] isaacs: ben_alman: if they're in the same install space, ti'll Just Work
[18:52] whatthefunk has joined the channel
[18:52] isaacs: ben_alman: all they have to do is put the plugin name in their grunt.json file
[18:52] isaacs: or grunt.js or however you tell grunt what to do
[18:52] ben_alman: will that work if both grunt and grunt-foo are global OR loval?
[18:53] ben_alman: local
[18:53] isaacs: they have to both be the same.
[18:53] ben_alman: well, that works for me
[18:53] ank has joined the channel
[18:53] ben_alman: i didn't realize
[18:53] isaacs: might want to document that if you've installed grunt locally, you need to also install the plugins locally.
[18:53] isaacs: and vice-versa if it's global
[18:53] ben_alman: yes
[18:53] ben_alman: that makes sense
[18:53] ben_alman: hmmn
[18:54] isaacs: then also you don't have to rely on the naming convention.  i could call a plugin grint, as long as i name it in the grunt.json, it doesn't matter.
[18:54] ben_alman: yeah
[18:54] ben_alman: it's just a convention
[18:54] ben_alman: so here's the complexity
[18:54] ben_alman: i'm not just requiring the module
[18:54] ben_alman: the module contains other assets i might need
[18:54] ben_alman: arbitrary files
[18:54] ben_alman: so i really need the path to the required grunt-foo
[18:54] isaacs: the module?
[18:54] isaacs: the plugin module?
[18:55] isaacs: require.resolve("grunt-foo") <-- that'll tell you
[18:55] ben_alman: i need to access "tasks"/ under grunt-foo
[18:55] ben_alman: ok
[18:55] ben_alman: let me try!

[18:55] tmike: ACTION is glad he's not working with this build system
[18:55] ben_alman: tmike: fwiw, a lot of people have given me really good feedback
[18:55] ben_alman: but fuck you :)
[18:55] ben_alman: heh
[18:55] isaacs: ben_alman: it'll give you the location of the "main" module, not the folder.
[18:55] tmike: lol
[18:55] bnoguchi has left the channel
[18:56] isaacs: ben_alman: but you can probably deduce that with a little bit of string jiggering.
[18:56] tmike: I'm sure it's awesome; it just sounds . . . hard
[18:56] ben_alman: ya
[18:56] isaacs: ben_alman: the root folder will be the first thing after the right-most node_modules folder
[18:56] dscape: mikeal: tako tako burrito burrito
[18:56] ben_alman: tmike: it's actually super simple. it comes with a scaffolding init feature too
[18:56] ben_alman: makes creating a new project super easy

[18:58] m00p has joined the channel
[18:58] tmike: So you're creating a system to build and maintain projects, using grunt as the build system.  these additional plugns are to extend grunt or for deployment purposes?
[18:59] ben_alman: people want to extend grunt, to add tasks that i haven't made
[18:59] ben_alman: like to minify css
[18:59] ben_alman: which i kinda don't care about
[18:59] tmike: and you want a central grunt, with centralized build tasks, but people want their own tasks on top
[18:59] ben_alman: yeah
[18:59] tmike: I dig
[19:00] ben_alman: i seriously looked at everything before starting to write this
[19:00] ben_alman: it's been a lot of work
[19:00] ben_alman: but i wasn't happy with anything else
[19:00] mikeal: dscape: hahaha

[19:01] ben_alman: dilvie: yes, there is a watch task
[19:01] dilvie: and let you hook in jshint?
[19:01] ben_alman: it can run arbitrtary tasks on file change
[19:01] ben_alman: jshint is built-in
[19:01] ben_alman: as is uglify js
[19:01] dilvie: ben_alman: hook me up with a url
[19:01] ben_alman: https://github.com/cowboy/grunt
[19:02] dilvie: ben_alman: thanks. =)
[19:02] ben_alman: i even have qunit running in phantomjs

[19:02] ben_alman: just to see what it does
[19:02] dilvie: Sounds like it does just about everything Hawthorn does (our internal build tool at RootMusic)
[19:03] ben_alman: cool

[19:04] ben_alman: np look forward to your feedback
[19:04] ben_alman: we have #grunt
[19:04] maxogden: mikeal: oha lso you should add the domain routing thing to tako today
[19:05] ben_alman: isaacs: is there any way to, while developing grunt or a grunt-foo module to have it load them from where they're being developed? they're "not yet" global while being developed, you see
[19:05] beejeebus has joined the channel
[19:05] ben_alman: i've done npm link to make the bin global
[19:05] mikeal: ok

[19:05] ben_alman: but… is there anything else i can do?

[19:10] ben_alman: isaacs: the only way i can see to generically look for grunt-foo globally if grunt is global or locally if grunt is local would be to look relative to __dirname inside of grunt… unless you know of a way to "simulate" grunt or grunt-foo being installed globally.. ideas?
[19:10] isaacs: grunt should not know whether it's global or not
[19:10] isaacs: it should be agnostic
[19:10] arduix has joined the channel
[19:10] ben_alman: right
[19:11] ben_alman: so what happens when i'm devving grunt and have made it global with npm link
[19:11] ben_alman: or am devving grunt-foo
[19:11] isaacs: ben_alman:  then you need to install the plugins locally to wherever grunt actually is for real
[19:11] isaacs: if grunt is global and grunt-foo is linked global, it'll work

[19:32] maxogden: T-Co: can you elaborate on what "making 'wget'" means
[19:32] tmike: I think me means a clone?
[19:33] tmike: he*
[19:33] maxogden: yawNO: closures are more espensive than not using closures
[19:33] tmike: T-Co: just start doing it.  Make you some requests and write you some files.
[19:33] yawNO: maxogden: exactly
[19:33] maxogden: *expensive
[19:33] yawNO: maxogden: so how comes that the ternary is faster?

[20:12] TooTallNate: which knows about the synonym names

[20:13] murvin: have anyone run into infinite loop when doing session ?  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9488568/node-js-session-with-infinite-loop
[20:13] nathanielk: tmike: see https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/get
[20:13] tmike: the basic structure is you assign a class to a pre, and then run a highlight function and it does its magic, but the highlight function is defined in the brush js files, like shBrushJScript.js
[20:14] tmike: So I was hoping to, in a fairly non-verbose way, make x.c, x.cpp refer to the same thing.

[20:19] murvin: Phoenixz:  show me your code.  most likely, inside your try & catch, there is some aysnc call.  async call will not be caught you need to have another try-catch in teh callback.
[20:19] EhevuTov has joined the channel
[20:20] Phoenixz: murvin: Ah! yes! Its an async call.. : So how do you do try / catch on async calls then?
[20:20] isaacs: tmike: no
[20:20] isaacs: tmike: oh, i'm scrolled way back, that quesiton was already answered *^_^*

[20:21] isaacs: yawNO: yes, 0.6 is very much stabilizing.  0.7 is still in motion.
[20:21] yawNO: isaacs: i'm actually using 0.7 because i need the new version of V8
[20:21] yawNO: (Direct proxies anyone? :P)
[20:21] murvin: usually,   you will have a function (e.g. file write).   file.write(data, function(err, data) {  try { .... } catch (ex) {} })     do another try and catch insdie the callback

[20:22] murvin: anyone can help me and take a look at this issue? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9488568/node-js-session-with-infinite-loop
[20:22] isaacs: yawNO: beware that the v8 version in 0.7 will keep upgrading very quickly without regard for ABI compatibility
[20:22] isaacs: yawNO: at least, until we start calling 0.7 0.8

[20:30] kcf: isaacs: i remember you were discussing tls stuff this past weekend and decided to run some tests against node and compare it to apache 2.2 on the same hardware... got about 600-650 SSL handshakes per sec with node, 2000 per sec with apache
[20:31] Lee_: I'm looking for the most efficient solution to restart a crashed nodejs process. Normally I'd use monit (for other services), but I'm new to node.js. I see that there's a system called 'forever'. Does this system poll like monit, or is it event based?
