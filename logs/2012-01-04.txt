[01:08] LukeBrookhart: the pkg file didn't install when I tried it last
[01:08] Shaunzie: I'd use brew to install it personally
[01:08] LukeBrookhart: since the pkg didn't work
[01:08] tbranyen: Shaunzie: its preference, but i've never had the pkg file fail for me
[01:08] LukeBrookhart: I found this
[01:08] LukeBrookhart: https://gist.github.com/579814
[01:08] LukeBrookhart: and used the first recommendation
[01:08] tbranyen: LukeBrookhart: if the pkg file didn't work you have either a screwed up system or you did something very wrong
[01:09] LukeBrookhart: hmm
[01:09] tbranyen: since its simply installing binaries into the correct path'd folders

[01:11] tbranyen: nicholasf: console.log(obj)
[01:11] LukeBrookhart: which node did nothing
[01:11] EuroNerd: I know this is a bit off-topic, but does anyone here have experience setting up VPN servers? 
[01:11] nicholasf: tbranyen: Im doing that, I get [Object object[
[01:11] nicholasf: I'm even calling toString() on the obj
[01:11] tbranyen: > var obj = { lol: "hi" }; console.log(obj);
[01:11] tbranyen: { lol: 'hi' }
[01:11] nicholasf: tbranyen: thanks, yeh my bad

[01:12] tbranyen: separate with commas instead of + if you want strings in there
[01:12] nicholasf: tbranyen: thanks!

[02:54] v_y: i said "into a string"
[02:55] v_y: i want what console.dir prints but in a string instead of stdout or whatever
[02:55] cmr: v_y: That isn't printing...
[02:55] v_y: like using pprint.format instead of pprint.pprint in python

[02:56] v_y: that will fail when it encounters a circular structure
[02:56] cmr: v_y: So you want the string representation of an object?
[02:56] v_y: yes
[02:56] v_y: cmr: yes
[02:56] tbranyen: v_y: then learn to read documentation
[02:56] v_y: lol

[02:59] tbranyen: i'm sure someone has matched the identical output, but console.dir itself you'll never get that value
[02:59] RLa: if anything else fails, try to set you own function as handler for stdout and collect output there
[02:59] RLa: btw, if object contains function how can you represent them
[03:00] tbranyen: RLa: Function.prototype.toString
[03:00] tbranyen: heh
[03:00] v_y: RLa: the answer turns out to be:   var util = require('util'); var stringRepresenation = util.inspect(someObject);

[03:19] isaacs: JasonSmith: that'd be kinda nice, i guess

[03:19] JasonSmith: I'm thinking, if a section heading is to be output (e.g. [blah]) then prefix it with newline *unless* it is the first line of the output
[03:20] shedinja: cmr: a quick ip check from somewhere would work then?
[03:20] cmr: shedinja: yep. whatismyip.org is the best IMO
[03:20] shedinja: cmr: cool thanks
[03:20] JasonSmith: isaacs: Any thoughts about the API? How I could specify that I want that feature? Or are you okay with it just doing that by default?
[03:20] isaacs: meh.  just make it the default
[03:21] isaacs: empty lines are not semantically relevant anyhow
[03:21] isaacs: JasonSmith: it'd be nice to not put an extra \n at the end of the file, if possible.
[03:21] isaacs: or at the beginning of the file
[03:21] JasonSmith: Yeah, it works like the Javascript comma prefix
[03:21] JasonSmith: i.e. add a "\n" prefix unless it is the very first line
[03:22] isaacs: yep.

[03:31] JasonSmith: mattrobenolt: Sure, I was more thinking you are free to pilfer the merge function from the second link
[03:31] mattrobenolt: I was just hoping there was something native to V8 that people didn't use in browser land that we could take advantage of in Node.
[03:32] RLa: you could always write it as extension in c++ :)

[04:05] dingomanatee: then defined the prototype Foo.prototype = { bar: [] }
[04:06] teadict: I hate it when people talk about classes
[04:06] dingomanatee: I noticed that when I created 2 new Foo()'s, they shared the same array 
[04:06] cmr: dingomanatee: Yes, that is how prototypes work
[04:06] teadict: that's how prototypes work
[04:06] sarlalian has joined the channel
[04:07] cmr: dingomanatee: First off, ditch the "class" thinking
[04:07] cmr: Because that isn't what it is
[04:07] teadict: and it's exactly how classes DONT work
[04:07] tbranyen: cmr: aw come on they uses classes under the hood
[04:07] tbranyen: use*
[04:07] dingomanatee: okay â€¦ well now I know. 
[04:07] dingomanatee: be nice
[04:07] cmr: tbranyen: implementation detail :P
[04:07] teadict: what under the hood? where? show me classes in JS
[04:07] dingomanatee: Date?
[04:07] tbranyen: teadict: learn how v8 uses hidden classes =)
[04:07] cmr: teadict: v8 uses hidden classes
[04:08] teadict: how? where there's no JS I bet
[04:08] RLa: why not composition?
[04:08] cmr: dingomanatee: Date is an object, not a class
[04:08] teadict: you can emulate them in JS.. I give you that...
[04:08] tbranyen: teadict: unless you're using something like narcissus, there is no JS in v8
[04:08] teadict: is that what v8 does?
[04:08] teadict: okey..
[04:08] tjfontaine: teadict: http://code.google.com/apis/v8/design.html
[04:08] teadict: then how does v8 relate to what we were talking about?
[04:08] tbranyen: no JS in the javascript interpreter is what i meant, not v8 =)
[04:09] gmcerveny has joined the channel
[04:09] RLa: most cases when you want inheritance in traditional oo sense can be solved with composition
[04:10] teadict: OO doesn't mean classes, hence everything can be solved or emulated without them
[04:10] tbranyen: yeah depending on the situation i'll sometimes use classes especially if the library/framework emulates them so closely
[04:10] tbranyen: easier to talk to people about it, instead of always saying constructors
[04:10] teadict: well, yes, that is true

[04:11] tbranyen: tjfontaine: are you working on anything cool lately?
[04:11] teadict: that's .... religious thinking
[04:11] tbranyen: saw you asking about ffi again recently
[04:11] tjfontaine: tbranyen: stemming from my hatered of swig I've started into NIH syndrome
[04:12] tbranyen: haha
[04:12] tjfontaine: tbranyen: right now I have a way to generate FFI bindings from a given header
[04:12] schanin has left the channel
[04:12] tbranyen: oh shit
[04:12] cmr: I don't think I've ever heard good things about swig..
[04:12] tbranyen: did you ever test perf? i'm curious if its really that far off from a native extension calling methods
[04:13] tjfontaine: no, this mostly for people looking to quickly bootstrap, perf is their problem :P
[04:13] tjfontaine: https://github.com/tjfontaine/node-libclang is where it lives atm, I've put it on hold for now while I consider a secondary project that would actually bootstrap c++ addons

[04:17] jamescarr: so what's the recommendation for "fixing" an app where I had a paths.js that shifted "models", "services", and "routes" onto the require.paths?

[04:17] tjfontaine: jesusabdullah: in this case I'm using it as a glorified C/C++ parser
[04:18] jesusabdullah: using the explicit paths, jamescarr?
[04:18] jamescarr: change all of them to ../../models/Dude and ../services/leads
[04:18] jesusabdullah: pretty much
[04:18] jamescarr: jesusabdullah, feels a little error prone?
[04:18] jesusabdullah: why?
[04:18] jesusabdullah: No more error prone than paths.unshift

[04:46] voidvector: codesurgeon is interesting i will play with it
[04:46] disappearedng has joined the channel
[04:46] benvie: oh you'll need to do path checking then
[04:46] mattrobenolt: Yeah, that's basically what I have now. Wasn't sure if there was a method built in to check.
[04:46] mattrobenolt: Thanks.
[04:47] benvie: yeah there's probably stuff you can reuse in node's builtin module loader
[04:47] mattrobenolt: Can you point me in the direction to look at code for that?
[04:47] benvie: or at least use for ideas
[04:47] ChrisMatthieu has joined the channel
[04:47] benvie: https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/module.js
[04:47] benvie: enough that you can pretty easily digest it
[04:47] benvie: small enough I mean
[04:47] mattrobenolt: benvie: +1
[04:48] benvie: awesome thing about node is how much is written in js and easily understandable
[04:48] mattrobenolt: Yeah, I'm not really new to Node. I've committed some stuff. ;)
[04:49] benvie: either way I like to reflect on that every time the opporutnity presents
[04:49] benvie: because I love it
[04:49] mattrobenolt: I just haven't looked into the actual module loading.
[04:50] benvie: I was over it recently because I wanted to make a version of the module system that worked with contexts
[04:50] benvie: ultimately wasn't enough there that was usable for that goal
[04:51] mattrobenolt: Worked with contexts how?
[04:51] benvie: like say you want to set up a new "top level" module inheritance chain
[04:51] benvie: or run everything in a disconnected set of vm contexts
[04:52] benvie: the way node handles contexts now (at the js level) isn't really conducive to that kind of stuff at all
[04:52] benvie: like if you wanted to run some stuff in a true sandbox but still observe it or something
[04:52] mattrobenolt: Ah, gotcha.
[04:53] mattrobenolt: WOuldn't that be something needed to handle mor eon the V8 side?
[04:53] mattrobenolt: I guess the call stack in a failed require reveals what's going on. Nothing special.
[04:53] benvie: well it would be, except it already is handled
[04:53] mattrobenolt: Just does a resolveFilename and fails on that.
[04:54] benvie: and it's just not implemented correctly (not sure the reason, maybe there's a good one) with how node does things
[04:54] benvie: I know it's all changing with isolates for the next release anyway
[04:54] benvie: but it's possible to do all that stuff now
[04:54] mattrobenolt: I wish I knew more about Javascript land, haha
[04:54] benvie: I mean in terms of like vm contexts
[04:55] mattrobenolt: I know nothing about how that shit is handled in Node or V8.
[04:55] benvie: basically when v8 creates a context it's this bare set of builtins
[04:55] mattrobenolt: My background is a lot of Python and more frontend Javascript to get by.
[04:55] benvie: node then basically copies references for all the stuff between each one, even when you're doing the sandbox load
[04:56] tjholowaychuk has joined the channel
[04:56] benvie: and it partially breaks stuff, like you can't do some JS stuff on objects from other contexts
[04:56] benvie: and then it partially just cross-exposes the things that do work
[04:57] RLa: just lets not make it too complex :)
[04:57] benvie: so if you try to sandbox something, it'ls still using the same process object you are
[04:57] benvie: and it can do stuff to it
[04:57] benvie: or use it as a way to pass messages to other contexts that it otherwise wouldn't know about
[04:58] Skaag has joined the channel
[04:59] benvie: and then on the thing you do want to work, 
[04:59] benvie: like you want to do console.log(someForeignObject) thing
[04:59] benvie: that is the thing that doesn't work
[04:59] mattrobenolt: benvie: I came here looking if there was a simple exists builtin or something to check if a module exists, and you've given me more information about contexts and sandboxing and vms than I can comprehend right now, haha
[04:59] benvie: hahah
[05:00] benvie: well to be succinct, the best answer is to try and include it as mentioned, and only avoid that if you have a specific reason to
[05:01] benvie: also maybe look into how npm keeps track of installed stuff
[05:01] mattrobenolt: I like to load settings for a project in as a "module", and I'm shoving environment specific settings into a module named: 'settings-'+env
[05:01] mattrobenolt: And I'm conditionally loading them in.
[05:01] benvie: https://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/lib/ls.js
[05:01] mattrobenolt: Fail silently if it doesn't exist.
[05:02] mattrobenolt: I just don't like the way a tryâ€¦catch looks.
[05:02] gigafied has joined the channel
[05:02] tuhoojabotti: Yeah
[05:02] benvie: npm is probably your bet, since it's the closest thing to a registry of what is actually on the system

[05:15] tuhoojabotti: citris: It all depends what you're trying to do.
[05:16] tuhoojabotti: Node.js is for example excellent for creating Web apps in short time.
[05:16] citris: I mostly just do freelance for people that need a small site but customized cms
[05:16] tuhoojabotti: And handling concurrency and so on and so forth
[05:17] tuhoojabotti: citris: Well, personally I think Node would satisfy your needs easily.
[05:18] jamescarr: anyone here using connect-form and running into a problem with the complete callback never being executed?
[05:18] tjholowaychuk: jamescarr Connect has multipart support now
[05:18] tjholowaychuk: via req.files

[05:18] jamescarr: so I don't need connect-form anymore?
[05:18] tjholowaychuk: http://senchalabs.github.com/connect/middleware-bodyParser.html
[05:18] tjholowaychuk: noe
[05:18] tjholowaychuk: nope*
[05:18] tuhoojabotti: citris: The only issue I can think of, is that Node is still in rapid development and thus updates can be harder than with something that has been around for longer.
[05:18] tjholowaychuk: in 2x there's bodyParser() == json() / urlencoded() / multipart()
[05:19] tjholowaychuk: so you can pick and choose
[05:19] teadict: tuhoojabotti: why do you say you have to proxy requests like an exceptional thing? what's your case?

[05:19] teadict: why?

[05:20] jamescarr: was staring to feel useless. I mean what kind of idiot can't upload a freaking file :)
[05:20] teadict: I mean, why is that uncommon?
[05:20] tjholowaychuk: jamescarr maybe they're not pausing and missing the data events
[05:20] tuhoojabotti: Well it's not.
[05:20] teadict: oh, k
[05:20] tuhoojabotti: I guess many people use like nginx 
[05:20] tjholowaychuk: jamescarr that's a big gotcha with node
[05:20] tuhoojabotti: teadict: But you said node replaces them, which is not always the case.

[05:56] RLa: hey
[05:56] RLa: it uses gtk?
[05:56] edjoperez: yes
[05:57] RLa: btw, qt might/will get v8 as qtscript backend
[05:58] RLa: so if you are looking into writing native gui apps in javascript it might be good thing to look at

[06:16] jamescarr: well, I guess it makes sense since there is now native windows support

[07:22] disappearedng: Shaunzie: thanks? Which one should I use 
[07:22] disappearedng: nodeunit doesn't cut it
[07:22] Shaunzie: disappearedng: I like mocha personally
[07:22] disappearedng: as a matter of fact I dun think I should be using unit testing frameowkrs at all 
[07:23] disappearedng: Did you read my question
[07:23] Shaunzie: https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha
[07:23] disappearedng: or are you just blindly recommending testing frameworks
[07:23] Shaunzie: disappearedng: yes, I read your question, but I don't see why you would use unit tests
[07:23] disappearedng: ok yeah I agree. How do I even test ? 
[07:24] disappearedng: do I chain 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,... test cases like that? 
[07:24] Shaunzie: disappearedng: that's sort of a loaded question :). That's like asking "How do I design my application" 
[07:24] SamuraiJack has joined the channel
[07:25] disappearedng: well is calling testStep5() { test1(); test2(); test3(); test4(); ... } even correct? 
[07:25] lz: Shaunzie, mocha's a good find, thanks
[07:25] disappearedng: I mean I am not asking you how to test 
[07:25] __doc__ has joined the channel
[07:25] disappearedng: I am asking you what I should do to test step5
[07:26] Shaunzie: You could create a mock object that contains all the necessary data to show that a player is in step 5 and test against that known data
[07:26] martin_sunset_ has joined the channel
[07:27] disappearedng: Shaunzie: What if the steps require to test step 5 IS step 1, 2, 3, 4? 
[07:27] disappearedng: aka 1) Everyone joins the game, 2) Everyone presses ready, 3) Someone fires a shot at UserC
[07:28] disappearedng: i.e. I want to test UserC is dead (step4) and the steps required to construct this case is ACTUALLY all those 3 combined in that chronological order? 
[07:28] FG has joined the channel
[07:30] Shaunzie: disappearedng: Can't you just test step 1, 2, 3, 4 separately?
[07:30] disappearedng: how can you test step 4? 
[07:30] Shaunzie: disappearedng: that depends on how you design your app :-/
[07:31] disappearedng: in setUp() { this.userC = new User("USER_C") ... }, testStep4 = function() { assert(this.userC.dead(), true); } throws userC is has not joined the game yet 
[07:31] Shaunzie: when in doubt steal. Try taking a look at existing applications that do unit tests and learn from their examples. That's more or less what I do
[07:32] Shaunzie: disappearedng: Then your setup is incorrect. If you are trying to test with the condition that a user has joined, manually join the user then test it.
[07:34] disappearedng: Then that's step2 !
[07:34] disappearedng: Shaunzie: What I am saying is, ALL THE MANUAL STEPS ARE PREVIOUS STEPS
[07:34] disappearedng: Do you see what I am getting at? 
[07:35] tuhoojabotti: jsQ: How to "map" and ignore some items?
[07:36] Shaunzie: disappearedng: If you need to remove the old steps in order to correctly test the new steps you can do that. Thats what I do when I test against data stored in a database. Delete old data, insert new data, test against the known data.
[07:37] disappearedng: Shaunzie: ok let say you are testing a database that allows you to retrieve previous data 
[07:37] disappearedng: So you first test "after inserting hello" I can get hello
[07:37] otakutomo has joined the channel
[07:37] disappearedng: and then you want to test "after inserting hello then inserting world", I can get "world then hello" 
[07:37] disappearedng: kind of like a stack 
[07:37] disappearedng: you will realize that you are essentially testing over and over again the crap that you have tested previously
[07:38] disappearedng: anyway I am just gonna do soemthing else I dun see this conversation leading to anything fruitful thanks anyway

[07:49] isaacs: JasonSmith: hey, yt?
[07:49] JasonSmith: isaacs: yo
[07:50] isaacs: so, i think it'd be better to just make the separator *always* be the end-of-line character.
[07:50] isaacs: and, make that \r\n on windows, rather than \n
[07:50] JasonSmith: So just a boolean option whether you want one or not?
[07:50] isaacs: no, just always do it
[07:50] isaacs: if anyone complains, we can make it an option
[07:51] JasonSmith: yeah I doubt they will complain
[07:51] isaacs: but they won't complain, because it's not relevant
[07:51] JasonSmith: also `tap test` fails BTW
[07:51] isaacs: doesn't change the results
[07:51] StanlySoManly has joined the channel
[07:51] isaacs: oh, that's lame
[07:51] JasonSmith: because fixtures/foo.ini cannot exec

[07:51] isaacs: oh, yeah, you gotta do `tap test/*.js`
[07:51] isaacs: working on that!!
[07:51] isaacs: i'm building out a generic .ignore glob handling stuff
[07:52] JasonSmith: no doubt. At your convenience, heck your email about that new couch "system db" feature
[07:52] JasonSmith: I read the patch and we may want to just backport that and rock just that
[07:52] isaacs: yeah, i saw that, haven't properly digested yet
[07:52] JasonSmith: It has a "likelihood of being commited" coefficient of 1.0
[07:53] JasonSmith: it gives you basically the same thing as my inbox db with _update hack
[07:53] JasonSmith: I will rewrite the inbox db to use its new API in fact
[07:54] isaacs:     When a "password" field is present, save_doc() will hash the password
[07:54] isaacs:     and write the result to the "password_sha" field, add a "salt" field
[07:54] isaacs:     and delete the "password" field:
[07:54] isaacs: oh, man.  want.
[07:54] JasonSmith: yeah
[07:54] isaacs: i could stop doing that client-side
[07:54] JasonSmith: so this also has repercussions on the PBKDF2 stuff
[07:54] JasonSmith: so now there is an obvious way for that to happen
[07:54] ZeepZop has joined the channel
[07:54] isaacs:     If the request's userCtx.name doesn't match the doc's name
[07:54] isaacs:       -> 404 // Not Found
[07:55] isaacs: that's not ideal for me, but i can hijack that default behavior to do shadow passwords
[07:55] JasonSmith: The good news is Couch developers decided that it's not always what you see is what you get anymore
[07:55] isaacs: yeah, that's very good news.
[07:55] JasonSmith: there is spooky action at a distance. Sometimes, some types of changes on some types of documents just DTRT
[07:56] JasonSmith: isaacs: Well I will backport this to 1.1 so what is the reason why that 404 is not ideal?
[07:56] pors has joined the channel
[07:56] isaacs: npm owner add user package
[07:56] isaacs: that checks to make sure that the user exists, and then does a write to package with their username and email address.
[07:57] JasonSmith: I see
[07:57] JasonSmith: so it's not that you want the document obscured, you just want the password fields obscured
[07:57] isaacs: yeah
[07:57] isaacs: but i mean, presumably this after_doc_read will be in javascript somewhere?
[07:58] JasonSmith: no it's Erlang
[07:58] JasonSmith: it's already implemented
[07:58] JasonSmith: the after_doc_read is an implementation detail to achieve the little workflow specified at the top of the commit message

[08:38] sproates has joined the channel
[08:38] isaacs: secoif: finding that boundary can be tricky
[08:39] secoif: isaacs I'm thinking along the lines of a private npm, or perhaps a different npm channel? npm namespace? 
[08:40] mikeal has joined the channel
[08:40] secoif: no issue with the modules being open source, just that they're fairly specific to our app
[08:40] secoif: or
[08:40] secoif: suite of apps.
[08:40] isaacs: well, here's the thing: publish the smallest module that you can, which is independently useful and test-covered.
[08:41] isaacs: SubStack's a good role model to follow on thise
[08:41] whitman has joined the channel
[08:41] isaacs: but, if X is only ever useful in the presence of Y and Z, you either a) need to just publish all three bits of functionality as one thing, or b) need to re-think the boundaries
[08:41] secoif: yeah I've been trying to get us more SubStack-like, "library driven development" processes
[08:42] SubStack: what what
[08:42] isaacs: SubStack: you're a role model.
[08:42] isaacs: for the kids
[08:42] SubStack: FOR THE KIDS
[08:42] isaacs: and their modules
[08:42] isaacs: (no loudbot in here, :(
[08:42] SubStack: that's right kids, you should drink espresso late and night and write node modules
[08:42] secoif: issacs I guess I could simply use git urls to pull in the other components without ever publishing to npm 
[08:42] HardPhuck has joined the channel
[08:42] isaacs: secoif: ew.
[08:43] isaacs: secoif: why not just publish them all?
[08:43] isaacs: if they suck, and that's why, then you've probably got other reasons to make them not suck, so just do that first.
[08:43] DTrejo: isaacs: do you agree with mikeal's post on checking in node_modules in production apps?
[08:43] isaacs: DTrejo: yes.
[08:43] isaacs: if you deploy it, check it in
[08:43] isaacs: if you don't, don

[08:43] isaacs: t
[08:43] DTrejo: k, good to know
[08:43] DTrejo: right
[08:43] secoif: isaacs yeah. The sucking is probably the issue.
[08:43] tbranyen: i checked in some node_modules and i dunno, kind of sucked to see my commit flooded
[08:43] AD7six has joined the channel
[08:43] isaacs: libraries should not have node_modules bundled in most cases.
[08:43] tbranyen: next time i'm making separate commits for node_modules
[08:44] isaacs: tbranyen: well, just commit them atomically.
[08:44] isaacs: npm install blah;  git add node_modules/blah;  git commit -m "install blah"
[08:44] tbranyen: yeah i didn't think of it at the time
[08:44] tbranyen: there were kinda just there and then :'(
[08:44] isaacs: rather than git ci -m "install foo and also fix a bunch of crap"
[08:44] isaacs: the point is to be able to bisect
[08:45] pquerna: +1, node_modules checked into apps, but not things posted to npm
[08:45] DTrejo: ^ gree
[08:45] DTrejo: agree
[08:45] isaacs: everyone agrees with this.
[08:45] DTrejo: felix might not agree
[08:45] isaacs: at least, everyone who has both published a module to npm, and also deployed anything ever.
[08:45] tbranyen: isaacs: question, is it possible to have a root level package.json but upon npm install instead installs to a node_modules folder in a sub dir?
[08:46] isaacs: tbranyen: no.
[08:46] djQuery has joined the channel
[08:46] tbranyen: oke doke
[08:46] romanb has joined the channel
[08:46] isaacs: tbranyen: but you can `npm install blah --prefix some/other/dir`
[08:46] isaacs: not sure why you'd want to do that.
[08:46] SubStack: split up your code into as many modules as possible
[08:46] isaacs: SubStack: not "possible"!
[08:47] SubStack: you're unlikely to encounter the lower bound of module size for a while
[08:47] pquerna: DTrejo: felix doesn't count, he is more like father time, from the old ages of node.js, before known history
[08:47] tbranyen: isaacs: hmmm that might be perfect
[08:47] tbranyen: i will try
[08:47] isaacs: as many modules as is reasonable, which is probably slightly more modules than you think is reasonable.
[08:47] isaacs: i aimed hard for "unreasonable" territory with node-tap initially, and found it.
[08:47] SubStack: I am known to be an unreasonable character!
[08:47] tbranyen: ah shit son
[08:47] DTrejo: pquerna: oh, I see.
[08:47] secoif: isaacs how small was unreasonable
[08:47] pquerna: DTrejo: (but <3 felix, haven't talked to him in awhile though)
[08:47] isaacs: secoif: 1 module per package.
[08:48] tbranyen: thx isaacs, any reason why you don't allow prefix configurable in the package.json?
[08:48] isaacs: secoif: many of them ended up all depending on each other.
[08:48] tbranyen: philosophical reasoning?
[08:48] DTrejo: *formidable <3 haha 
[08:48] SubStack: isaacs: I think with re-targetting it could work
[08:48] secoif: isaacs is that a problem though?
[08:48] isaacs: tbranyen: because package.json defines one package.  that package has deps.  that is the entirety of the complexity
[08:48] SubStack: seems to have more been a problem of circular deps than modules being too small
[08:48] isaacs: secoif: eventually yes.
[08:48] secoif: isaacs other than cluttering up the npm repoâ€¦
[08:48] tbranyen: isaacs: fair enough
[08:48] isaacs: SubStack: not small in LoC or whatever, small in functionality.
[08:49] SubStack: check out this module I wrote earlier today https://github.com/substack/node-coords/blob/master/index.js
[08:49] SubStack: so tiny
[08:49] tbranyen: isaacs: is it possible for package.json to reference folders above its containment? basically i have an app that is a package, but i want everything contained to a build folder, because the rest of it is just a static web app
[08:49] isaacs: tap-test can't even exist without tap-consumer and tap-producer and tap-harness.
[08:49] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[08:49] isaacs: tap-harness depends on tap consumer and tap producer
[08:49] tbranyen: so if i had a build/package.json could package.json see folders/files at one level up so the same level as build?
[08:49] isaacs: it's all too incestuous.
[08:49] isaacs: may as well just be one thing
[08:50] isaacs: tbranyen: no
[08:50] tbranyen: kk
[08:50] secoif: SubStack yeah I have little things like that all through our codebase, could be broken out but I'm hesitant to add more clutter.
[08:50] isaacs: tbranyen: why not just have one root-level package, and that's it?
[08:50] zilch has joined the channel
[08:50] secoif: not suggesting your module is clutter :P
[08:50] isaacs: tbranyen: you can get at modules in parent node_modules folders just as easily
[08:50] tbranyen: isaacs: because its a static web app with an optional build process, why bother installing node_modules to the root if its never used
[08:50] isaacs: SubStack: the trick with writing tiny modules is finding tiny pieces of functionality that are independently useful
[08:51] SubStack: secoif: better to keep the clutter on npm where it is isaacs's problem than to keep them in your own codebase
[08:51] tbranyen: it'd be nice to define those deps at the root and install to the prefix, which is what i'm thinking now, except i'd also like to publish to npm
[08:51] tbranyen: and that kind of breaks the whole prefix thing :-/
[08:51] tbranyen: unless i do a post script to move it manually
[08:51] raincole has joined the channel
[08:51] isaacs: tbranyen: is it really that big a problem to have it there if it's not used?
[08:51] isaacs: is it some compilation that might fail?
[08:52] secoif: SubStack good idea. I'm all for giving isaacs my problems.
[08:52] tbranyen: isaacs: trying to maintain a separation of concerns atm
[08:52] SubStack: SEPARATE ALL THE CONCERNS
[08:52] isaacs: tbranyen: a noble ambition.
[08:52] isaacs: however, often overrated.
[08:52] tbranyen: someone could theoretically install this "boilerplate" jazz and then simply delete a single folder to work with a static site
[08:52] isaacs: adding complexity to save a single .js file is probably not worth it.
[08:52] tbranyen: and not worry about lingering node_modules
[08:52] isaacs: just put the extra file there.

[08:53] isaacs: disk space is growing faster than money.
[08:53] isaacs: it's free.
[08:53] isaacs: the other day i was cleaning my room, and stumbled across a spindle of CD-Rs
[08:53] isaacs: i realized how horribly outdated those are.
[08:54] tbranyen: =)
[08:54] isaacs: the whole spindle has less storage power than my phone's SD card.
[08:54] isaacs: and my phone's sd card is only 16GB
[08:54] zilch: if I want to have "esper" or "streambase" alternative in node.js land, what would be it ?
[08:54] isaacs: because i have a crappy phone.
[08:54] SubStack: that's it
[08:55] SubStack: I was drawing snoop dawg but now I'm going to draw some snowclones
[08:55] zilch: basically, I am looking for complex event processing solution in node.js
[08:55] isaacs: zilch: i've never heard of those two things.
[08:55] isaacs: zilch: have you seen EventEmitter2?
[08:55] SubStack: zilch: why are you looking for complex solutions
[08:56] isaacs: zilch: npm install eventemitter2

[09:06] secoif: Shaunzie what are you using hookio for?
[09:08] HardPhuck: guys, a question, how can I "transmit" data from one nodejs application to another (both on the same server)
[09:08] martin_sunset: secoif: I am using it for background processing, in combination with rabbitmq. Hook.io is really great, takes a lot of inspiration from akka 
[09:08] HardPhuck: for example, If I save a document to mongo, I would like to alert the other application (and send it the same document)
[09:09] martin_sunset: HardPhuck: Rabbitmq could be used for that
[09:09] HardPhuck: isn't that a bit overkill?
[09:09] martin_sunset: HardPhuck: It depends on te number of docs ;)

[09:18] disappearedng: wtf? do you know underscore? 
[09:18] secoif: the values?
[09:19] HardPhuck: leo2007: it depends on the user
[09:19] HardPhuck: and how you install modules
[09:19] leo2007: npm install MODULE
[09:19] secoif: disappearedng no reason to act like an asshole when I'm trying to help you. it looks like you're just looping over an object?

[09:26] yatesy: Hey folks, I've got a question about bundleDependencies. It would seem that if I have a package A which depends on another package B that I've also bundled, the dependencies of C aren't included if i do npm pack on package A, despite the dependencies being in the node_modules folder. Is this intended?

[09:28] leo2007: does npm read a config script?
[09:28] secoif: leo2007 is it possible you're using two different versions of npm?
[09:28] TheJH: leo2007, uhm, could you please execute `npm -v`?
[09:29] leo2007: secoif: the version on Linux is from Ubuntu. I built one on OSX myself.
[09:29] TheJH: leo2007, global by default is only active in really ancient versions of npm
[09:29] leo2007: TheJH: you are right. I was confused. I am new to node.js.
[09:30] TheJH: leo2007, so, what is your npm version on ubuntu?
[09:30] leo2007: I can built x86_64 v8 on OSX (Snow leopard 10.6.8), but when building node.js it is only i386.
[09:30] TheJH: run `npm -v`

[09:30] secoif: leo2007 node moves pretty fast, I always try to be on the latest version of everything.
[09:30] leo2007: TheJH: 0.4x
[09:31] TheJH: leo2007, is that the npm version or the node version?
[09:31] leo2007: TheJH: 1.1.0-beta-7 on my Mac. I have no access to the ubuntu box now.
[09:31] TheJH: leo2007, in npm, everything starting with a zero is ancient. in node, 0.1-0.3 is super-ancient, 0.4-0.5 is outdated, 0.6 is recent stable
[09:32] secoif: leo2007 you want to be at least npm 1.x. When you get ontyo your ubuntu box next, upgrade npm, upgrade node. upgrade all the things.
[09:32] leo2007: TheJH: I am running the latest of all of them on Mac.
[09:32] leo2007: secoif: OK.

[09:54] tuhoojabotti: I wouldn't be surprised if there was module for this already in npm
[09:54] secoif: disappearedng that looks pretty tidy to me, you could use ++ operator and perhaps convert lines 4-8 into a single ternary
[09:55] disappearedng: wow really? I came from python and there's something called defaultdict
[09:55] secoif: you could even get rid of the  === undefined and just say if (tele[role])

[09:55] peterrs: tuhoojabotti: symlinking was my initial thought, but i had some resolving issues.. was hoping node.js offered a way of dealing with this kind of stuff.. but i guess i will have to look in the npm registry and see what it offers

[11:59] martin_sunset: chillfactor: There is a comprehensive examples folder on github that, as far ask remember, contains a canonical error handling sample.

[12:01] chot: i'm interested in the opinion of someone who's been using node.js for a larger project; does the fact that javascript isn't typed ever become a problem?
[12:01] Industrial: chot: no.
[12:01] martin_sunset: Chot about 20k of coffeescript here... No
[12:01] martin_sunset: Chot the reason is 
[12:02] martin_sunset: Chot that you need to test your code, regardless of the type system of the underlying language, so type checking in strongly typed languages is a bit redundant when doing test driven development
[12:03] voidvector has joined the channel
[12:04] martin_sunset: Chot besides, it forces you to create smaller modules, which is good for overall code quality
[12:04] chot: martin_sunset: hm ok, that's interesting
[12:05] chot: how about things like intellisense (auto-complete) and refactoring?
[12:06] martin_sunset: Chot interestingly I don't miss intelligense to much. I am used to visual studio but can live very well with textmate
[12:06] djQuery has joined the channel
[12:06] martin_sunset: Refactoring is the same, as long as you have enough tests
[12:07] TheJH: chot, as soon as uglifyjs gets support for locating all tokens and stuff, it should be relatively easy to write stuff for refactoring
[12:07] martin_sunset: In general our coffeescript code is of better quality then our c# code these days, despite 10 years of c# practice
[12:08] martin_sunset: TheJH: That sounds great
[12:09] kazupon has joined the channel
[12:09] chot: martin_sunset: alright, that's interesting
[12:09] TheJH: martin_sunset, not so great - nobody is working on that, I think :D
[12:09] d0k has joined the channel
[12:10] TheJH: martin_sunset, tried and I've got a patch that adds source code locations to all AST nodes - but completely incorrect, as it seems :D
[12:10] chot: TheJH: never heard of uglify js, i'll have a look though
[12:10] martin_sunset: TheJH: Too bad. It's a great idea though, just imagine what can be done once you have this info
[12:11] martin_sunset: Chot uglify.js is used a lot in rails and node.js to mining JavaScript. Very cool project
[12:11] leo2007 has left the channel
[12:11] TheJH: martin_sunset, in case you want to hack on it: https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/issues/241 https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/pull/279
[12:11] martin_sunset: Mining = minify. 
[12:12] TheJH: also mining = getting all the require calls for browserification
[12:12] TheJH: :D
[12:12] martin_sunset: Thejh haha, I wish I had time. 
[12:13] chot: martin_sunset: ah ok

[16:16] vdemedes: mattkime: "\\"
[16:16] mattkime: yes, i've tried that

[16:20] mattkime: so simply avoiding the problem isn't a solution

[18:48] CrawfordComeaux: I found exceptionhub.com the other day & have been going over their js file. Thinking of rolling my own based on their techniques & just uploading to node instead of paying them (being broke sucks)

[18:59] steveoh: what's that doing isaacs 
[18:59] isaacs: steveoh: clean the cache, install the latest 1.1 version of npm globally, then use that to install jshint.
[19:00] steveoh: npm@alpha will resolve?
[19:00] isaacs: steveoh: the issue is that the jshint .npmignore file exposes a bug in 1.1.0-beta-4, which is fixed in beta-7

[19:03] CrawfordComeaux: brianthecoder: the issue with a big-ass try-catch is that usually you'll wind up catching errors pretty far away from where they occurred, so they don't really help identify the cause. that's at least true for client-side...i'm very new to node, so unsure if it applies here, but seems likely.

[19:23] steveoh: liek i put uglify.js instead of uglify-js
[19:23] isaacs: exactly
[19:23] steveoh: habit i guess
[19:23] isaacs: sure

[19:24] dscape: so all package names should have the same importance?

[19:24] isaacs: def wanna pull from cache if possible, though.  maybe something like a month cache expiry, even.
[19:25] dscape: cause a dictionary uses frequency to determine which is more likely
[19:26] dscape: isaacs: ideally short would return an array of objects with package name, and weight
[19:26] dscape: that would help make it more likely you suggest what people are searching for
[19:26] isaacs: meh
[19:26] isaacs: :)
[19:26] isaacs: equal weight is fine

[20:00] dilvie: The primary draw of BYU is that it's a Mormon school. Most of the students are Mormon. I wouldn't date a Mormon (just because of differences in religious belief, and the culture implications of being a non-member in a marriage with a devoted member -- read, you get left out of a lot of things that your spouse would consider extremely significant).

[21:05] megalomix: when I do mysql.query("", function())

[21:07] megalomix: if there is not a function it is sync ?
[21:07] bnoordhuis: megalomix: synchronous functions return a result
[21:08] bnoordhuis: e.g. var rowset = mysql.query("SELECT 1")
[21:08] bnoordhuis: asynchronous functions take a callback that's invoked once the result is ready
[21:08] bnoordhuis: e.g. mysql.query("SELECT 1", function(rowset) { ... })

[22:37] monteslu: upstream, should parser.parseString('<test><t></t></test>')  give me back a JS object representing the full dom?
[22:38] monteslu: the examples are reading a file
[22:39] CarterL has joined the channel
[22:39] wenger: upstream: you can 1) use socket.io-client running in node on one of the servers or 2) open the communication and continue to feed content down the response with response.write and don't close the response - the keep alive is automatic
[22:39] upstream: I think in that example it would give you a JS object like {"t":""}, if you want the first node you need to pass an option to parser
[22:40] criswell has joined the channel
[22:40] upstream: monteslu: var parser = new xml2js.Parser({explicitRoot: true});
[22:41] upstream: monteslu: I haven't tried just passing a string but I bet it works
[22:42] isaacs: monteslu: you seen xml2js?
[22:42] upstream: wenger: Thanks for the tips, I think i'll try both options and see which performs best
[22:42] monteslu: isaacs, trying it now :)
[22:43] versicolor_ has joined the channel
[22:44] monteslu: the object returned is kinda complex
[22:45] isaacs: monteslu: yeah
[22:45] isaacs: xml is kind of complex, unfortunately
[22:45] isaacs: since you have attribs, and innertext, and child tags
[22:45] isaacs: it's not really a 1:1 semantic match to json
[22:45] isaacs: (or any object structure for that matter)
[22:46] monteslu: isaacs, its not, but I've done this in php and java
[22:46] isaacs: monteslu: if you look at the source of xml2js, it's really pretty simple
[22:46] isaacs: i bet you could whip something decent out in the time it'd take to figure out how to use something else ;)
[22:46] wenger: upstream: np
[22:46] monteslu: haha
[22:46] isaacs: (and now you know why there are so many node modules)
[22:46] isaacs: :)
[22:46] rgl has joined the channel
[22:46] monteslu: might just need a toJSON() method on the retured object
[22:47] upstream: like json_encode / json_decode from PHP land?
[22:48] upstream: monteslu: I did a bit of looking at various libs for XML to JSON and felt that xml2js was the best option
[22:48] monteslu: upstream, something like that
[22:48] JarrodBell has left the channel
[22:48] monteslu: thought the php one had its own bugs
[22:48] Emmanuel` has joined the channel
[22:48] monteslu: like not going deep enough into the object without manual intervention
[22:49] upstream: monteslu: yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about there haha
[22:49] monteslu: but the java one, i used was from json-lib and worked pretty well
[22:49] upstream: if your XML doesn't have attributes the JS object will be semi normal looking ;)

[22:53] isaacs: monteslu: https://gist.github.com/1562654
[22:53] isaacs: monteslu: what's your little example?
[22:53] monteslu: ooh, 514 characters and only the top level object.  Thinking I'm gonna need to write recursive code
[22:53] monteslu: isaacs,  JSON.stringify(parser.parseString('<test><t></t></test>'))
[22:54] isaacs: monteslu: parseString returns the parser, not the result
[22:54] monteslu: ahh, ok
[22:54] isaacs: monteslu: JSON.stringify(parser.parseString('<test><t></t></test>').resultObject)
[22:55] buu has joined the channel
[22:55] monteslu: isaacs, resultObject is undefined
[22:55] isaacs: orly?
[22:56] isaacs: monteslu: oh, i guess it's not set right away
[22:56] isaacs: i dno't really know how to use xml2js ;)
[22:56] isaacs: just kinda hack around with it whenever i need something quick and dirty
[22:56] monteslu: oh, needs another callback or something maybe?
[22:56] isaacs: this works: https://gist.github.com/1562654
[22:56] mikeal has joined the channel
[22:56] isaacs: call parser.parseString, and then p.resultObject should be set.
[22:57] isaacs: but i guess it's not set on the return value?  i dunno whay
[22:57] monteslu: yeah, not set.  I'm doing the same as your gist

[23:09] teadict: so, I looked up Access Control Lists.. found node_acl...
[23:09] teadict: node_acl uses node_redis... I don't even know what redis is

[23:26] upstream: teadict: seems more of an architecture question than node specific, there are a lot of possible solutions you could engineer
[23:26] teadict: so I should just take care of it myself?
[23:27] upstream: teadict: you'll have to roll your own or use a module, i'm not sure that node provides ACL out of the box
[23:27] teadict: didn't find any
[23:27] upstream: teadict: are you using express?
[23:27] teadict: yes

[23:28] eeemsi_: isaacs: is it possible that everyone who replicates your registry runs into https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COUCHDB-1176 ?
[23:28] upstream: teadict: there are some basic user permissions examples for express on the homepage, you could start by extending that to include groups based permissions or other
[23:29] isaacs: eeemsi_: a jira access restrictionâ€¦.?
[23:29] teadict: upstream: yes, using that doc was plan B.. thanks.. I'll go that road then.. also, I'll use MySQL, would you recommend this ORM? https://github.com/sdepold/sequelize
[23:29] upstream: teadict: redis is a key:value store (http://redis.io) to answer your prev. question, it's a form of datastore, which you'll likely want when setting up an ACL system
[23:29] eeemsi_: isaacs: works on my side
[23:29] teadict: upstream: that was plan A...
[23:30] eeemsi_: oh wait â€¦ â€¦
[23:30] upstream: teadict: yeah whatever works for you, I personally use CouchDB a lot with Node, MySQL or Redis or Mongo, there are options :)
[23:30] teadict: upstream: but assignning permission to routes is not worth installing redis and a acl module..
[23:30] teadict: great.. I'm not that off then..
[23:30] eeemsi_: ah â€¦ JIRA is currently being reindexed
[23:30] quackquack has joined the channel
[23:31] indexzero has joined the channel
[23:31] upstream: teadict: yeah, well if you want a simple solution I wouldn't even implement an ACL as they are usually not simple solutions but more robust
[23:31] upstream: teadict:  in my experience that is. It's easier to just roll your own :)
[23:31] mmalecki: isaacs: you around?
[23:32] teadict: upstream: then I'll use that ORM with mysql and create my own security thingies
[23:32] isaacs: a little
[23:32] teadict: node-orm doesn't look that great..
[23:32] isaacs: wha'ts up?
[23:32] mmalecki: isaacs: https://gist.github.com/2072e7818c844575ff3d <- when running `npm install` in mock-request

[23:32] mmalecki: I think jitsu does that as well.
[23:32] mmalecki: should I create an issue or is it known?
[23:32] upstream: teadict: also you could try https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql
[23:33] upstream: maybe there are better mysql wrappers now-a-days though, I haven't used MySQL with Node in a long time :)
[23:33] teadict: upstream: I'll sure need an ORM... that's the case
