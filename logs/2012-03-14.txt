[00:00] initohen: b knows that c requires old-d
[00:00] initohen: a knows that b requires old-d
[00:00] initohen: and i know that a requires it
[00:00] initohen: a bigger problem would be: why would you name the handler the same if it was incompatible
[00:00] initohen: :\
[00:00] initohen: i guess since there's no versioning in file extensions you have a tricky dilemma
[00:01] initohen: but i expect that most libraries in active use will try to keep current
[00:01] initohen: i prefer not to depend on a dozen things
[00:01] initohen: which is why i went with zombie over uhh.. whatever that other one was... phantom?
[00:01] tmike: your package.json will enforce versions
[00:01] maxownz has joined the channel
[00:01] initohen: his problem is that he has two packages, both required, that may differ in version
[00:01] initohen: but will compete for the same extension
[00:02] tmike: same extension?
[00:02] initohen: iced-coffee-script supplies .coffee and .iced
[00:02] tmike: ah
[00:02] initohen: but the dependency on coffee-script i guess downloads coffee-script?
[00:02] initohen: i dunno
[00:02] iangreenleaf: Yes, coffee-script is an npm module just like any other.
[00:02] tmike: The dependency on coffee-script would download coffee-script
[00:03] initohen: sure, but if it was a little smarter it'd be able to recognize that the coffee-script dependency is satisfied without coffee-script
[00:03] initohen: it seems that if the two are version-incompatible you have a difficulty, however
[00:04] iangreenleaf: IMO require.extensions should be scoped by modules. That would be consistent with the way require searches for packages.
[00:05] iangreenleaf: i.e. require("foo") will prefer a locally-installed foo over a global foo
[00:05] initohen: fair enough
[00:08] iangreenleaf: Anyways, thanks for the chat. I'm gonna poke around the node issues tomorrow and see if it has come up.

[01:15] JasonSmith has joined the channel
[01:15] Anthus: me too, cheers.
[01:15] ningu: so I thought it might be possible to hack node into making its async functions sync, just for the purpose of making code cleaner in batch scripts
[01:15] tmike: woof

[01:16] tommyvyo has joined the channel
[01:16] diogogmt has joined the channel
[01:16] ningu: the module would be called blockhead

[01:16] insin: fibers and that
[01:16] ningu: hmmm
[01:17] tmike: fibers just makes your code LOOK sync.  I think ningu's talking about killing all asynchronicity
[01:17] diva has joined the channel
[01:18] octayn: As long as it looks sync that's all that matters, right?
[01:18] octayn: if the objective is "clean code"
[01:19] ningu: yes, that's all I really meant
[01:19] insin: when was the last mailing list ding-dong on fibers?
[01:19] ningu: I was talking about doing it by actally making it sync, but whatever
[01:19] kevinswiber: Call me a masochist, but sometimes, when it's late at night... I enjoy passing continuations.  :X
[01:20] ningu: continuations are awesome
[01:20] ningu: there are just situations where they are annoying, too
[01:20] octayn: kevinswiber: manual cps is a bitch but I wouldn't mind an 'async' keyword or similar that does CPS implicitly for you
[01:20] ningu: and I like node enough that I'd want to use it for those situations too, if I could :)
[01:20] kevinswiber: Aren't there a bunch of solutions offering that inline "async/yield" functionality?
[01:21] theBrettman has joined the channel
[01:21] ningu: npm sure has been updated a lot lately
[01:21] octayn: kevinswiber: haven't really looked into it
[01:22] octayn: node-sync looks promising
[01:22] whaley has joined the channel
[01:23] ningu: yeah, it's a syntax issue more than anything, in most ways
[01:23] ningu: I don't mind the logic of async code
[01:23] ningu: it can just be hard to grok quickly when you read it
[01:24] tmike: It's a little better if you're super strict about naming your functions and not indenting more than one or two levels
[01:24] ningu: well, in my experience it gets really messy when you have a long task that must execute in sequence
[01:24] bwen has left the channel
[01:24] ningu: not sure if async waterfall or substack's Seq is better for that
[01:25] ningu: I have things like cb, cb2, cb3, etc. so I can remember which is at which level

[01:32] ningu: I might try rewriting that script in seq just for fun
[01:33] ningu: see if it gets any easier
[01:34] Eruadan: hey ningu, i think i was a bit equivocated yesterday, when i said about normal apps in node also. Is not because the server is async that the apps must be also. Also, I was thinking about all this forums online, like phpbb etc. they suffer always from slows in the searches, maybe node could help there. Now, i'm putting a blog up and running. npm is addictive ;p
[01:35] sphinxxx has joined the channel
[01:35] ningu: Eruadan: of course, anything that runs on a server is much better if it's async
[01:35] ningu: I was just talking about making node pleasant to use in other situations
[01:35] ningu: there are plenty of other tools for that, but it would be nice, if a particular node library was exactly what I needed anyway.
[01:36] Eruadan: sure, and not only more pleasant but faster
[01:36] ningu: yeah, although that isn't my main concern for scripts
[01:36] ningu: I write lots of little scripts, for example right now I'm writing a paper and using a script to generate a LaTeX table from an excel spreadsheet
[01:36] ningu: node doesn't have an excel parsing lib, can't use node ;)
[01:36] Eruadan: what you think if all those forums everywhere were in node? would they support a higher number of searches?
[01:37] ningu: I don't know. I don't really know how slow they are, to be honest.
[01:37] ningu: and most forum searches are really bad :P
[01:37] octayn: If it's CPU heavy, of course not.
[01:37] ningu: I tend to just use google

[01:47] Eruadan: mm, cool
[01:48] ningu: hrm... "asynchronous function which was called synchronously through node-sync doesn't blocks the whole process - it blocks only current thread!" ... I thought node was single-threaded?
[01:48] Eruadan: mm, so it reverses the game?
[01:49] octayn: ningu: you can create threads
[01:49] octayn: And I'm guessing that's what node-fibers does
[01:49] kevinswiber: I think the fiber is "thread-like," though not a thread.
[01:49] kevinswiber: The project threads_a_go_go creates real threads.

[01:52] neoesque has joined the channel
[01:52] ericmuyser: it was probably worth mentioning because you could have your own threading, but also node does spawn a few worker threads for its pool iirc, like buffering data from a network connection (guessing here, it's what boost asio does)
[01:54] kevinswiber: ericmuyser: Yeah, I believe that's correct, though I think that piece may be abstracted behind libuv.

[01:59] hydrozen: :P
[01:59] kevinswiber: What's your OS?
[02:00] hydrozen: does nvm do any of the weird stuff rvm does? like messing around with cd and stuff
[02:00] hydrozen: kevinswiber: Lion
[02:01] kevinswiber: As long as your OS has a bash shell, any of those options should work.
[02:01] kevinswiber: They're all simple shell scripts.
[02:01] crescendo has joined the channel
[02:01] kevinswiber: RVM is way more involved.
[02:01] kevinswiber: If I had to pick for you, I'd choose nvm, because it's what I already know.  :P

[03:09] raghu_: like building a blog  on node.js

[03:21] tuhoojabotti: I'd say yes.
[03:21] plato: raghu_: it certainly looks like a shallower learning curve
[03:22] ningu: raghu_: node is faster than php and ruby. it has fewer existing libraries. not a small number of libraries, but less pre-fab things like drupal for php

[03:29] Sadin: Could anyone give me a good guide on adding Jquery to your pages properly without screwing up your node app
[03:29] raghu_: plato: how do u feel about node.. the main reason for me on trying node is because of even driven.. that makes real time apps REAL TIME
[03:29] ningu: Sadin: err, it's the same as adding jquery to anything
[03:29] Sadin: ningu really? i added links in my header and it broke my express app...
[03:29] Sadin: had to revert

[03:30] ningu: maybe you used invalid jade syntax

[03:30] kevinswiber: Sadin: Sure it wasn't your templating engine?
[03:30] kevinswiber: ningu: Jinx.  Smart.
[03:30] plato: raghu_: the future is distributed networks, node is good for that
[03:30] Sadin: kevinswiber who knows all i get from nodejitsu is internal server error lol

[03:31] kevinswiber: Unfortunately, Jade doesn't do a pretty print of HTML, so it's hard to work backwards when debugging.
[03:31] ningu: Sadin: test locally before pushing to nodejitsu
[03:31] ningu: kevinswiber: I just use the chrome element view, usually
[03:31] michaelmartinez: ningu that what I was thinking
[03:32] kevinswiber: ningu: Yeah, that works.  Inspect!
[03:32] Eruadan: nice, i just installed nodepress :)
[03:32] michaelmartinez: I don't know how to do shit yet, but I do know I need to develop that bitch locally

[03:36] raghu_: kevinswiber: will that really matter ??
[03:36] michaelmartinez: raghu it matters for coffeescript
[03:36] Sadin: i didnt think so but thanks for pointing it out
[03:36] ningu: it only matters if you do it within one string
[03:36] ningu: jade doesn't care
[03:36] ep0x: ningu: I think there's a way to write your node.js along with jquery on the server side, and then just send out the jquery code to the client
[03:36] technel has joined the channel
[03:36] kevinswiber: raghu_: Actually, I have no idea how Jade handles that.
[03:37] ningu: kevinswiber: it looks fine to m
[03:37] ningu: e
[03:37] ningu: oh
[03:37] ningu: the issue is in index.jade
[03:37] ningu: you need to separate attributes with commas
[03:37] ningu: not spaces

[03:39] raghu_: oh gr8
[03:39] ningu: if you have a vps you don't need nodejitsu
[03:39] ningu: I mean, just to start out
[03:39] ningu: I used nodejitsu first cause i didn't have anywhere else to host
[03:39] raghu_: is cloud a gud suggestion for node or we can still stick with a VPS like linode ?
[03:40] ningu: nothing wrong with a vps
[03:40] ningu: you can run the node app on its own or through a reverse proxy like nginx
[03:40] plato: raghu_: dont use linode for bitcoin, har har
[03:41] raghu_: suggest me one.. linode is cheap thats what i know
[03:41] kevinswiber: raghu_: Re: cloud vs VPS... It really depends on what you're doing.
[03:41] ningu: I'm doing little enough that I'm using a VPS for now :)

[06:14] michaelmartinez: The flexibility is crazy and maddening at time... I just finally wrapped my mind around this
[06:14] michaelmartinez: Have you specified a bodyparser?
[06:16] michaelmartinez: I just use the layout for the "shell" then I place all the body stuff in different ejs files that are passed to layout before final render

[14:33] newbieNode: yes
[14:33] tmike: I'm surprised to see RHEL3 still out there
[14:34] newbieNode: this is just an old development playground box...no real use...i think i can find a more updated box somewhere...
[14:34] tmike: You'll likely have an easier time of it there.  I wish you luck.
[14:34] newbieNode: thanks for the help tmike :)
[14:35] tmike: Not that I was much help, you're welcome.
[14:36] tmike: HAS anyone built node on a 2.4 system?

[15:49] yawNO: they slow the hell down.. i hope proxies will fix this bottleneck.. havent looked at benchmarks though

[15:50] tjholowaychuk: haha yeah exactly
[15:50] tjholowaychuk: proxies / accessors are just
[15:50] tjholowaychuk: unnecessary
[15:50] yawNO: why
[15:50] tjholowaychuk: but they're there so it can be tempting to use them

[16:25] yawNO: oh
[16:25] yawNO: csb
[16:25] tmike: Not everyone has grok'd json yet.  Some APIs still think xml's the way to go
[16:25] yawNO: i like json better
[16:26] CoverSlide: yaml ftw!
[16:26] tmike: of course, we're working with js ;)
[16:26] yawNO: its a matter of choice i suppose
[16:26] maritz: it really depends on what kind of data you have. there are still valid uses for xml, imo
[16:26] tmike: such as heavily attributed data
[16:26] maritz: *troll*like SOAP*/troll*
[16:26] yawNO: tmike: thats true

[16:31] Industrial: Anyone have an idea?

[16:32] baudehlo: tmike: well couch is acid when you write one record. But you can't update "relations" in couch in an ACID way.
[16:32] yawNO: wat?
[16:32] tmike: maritz: I really don't know.  I'm just getting into playing with couch
[16:32] yawNO: snowboarding?
[16:32] fangel has joined the channel
[16:32] yawNO: jeez snow melted here ;_
[16:32] yawNO: i hate you
[16:32] Industrial: snowboarding in a fake environment with real snow, to like, relax, you know.
[16:32] Industrial: with a roof on it ;o
[16:32] tmike: baudehlo: I dig.  That requires running the view and having it rebuild the whole view cache thing, right?
[16:32] yawNO: wat?
[16:33] yawNO: whats that?
[16:33] mmalecki: Industrial: sup?
[16:33] Industrial: can I do this: Tag = resourceful.define 'tag' Tag.property 'name', String   Item = resourceful.define 'item' Item.property 'tags', [Tag]
[16:33] Industrial: with a mongodb backend saving the tags a subdocument on the item
[16:33] baudehlo: tmike: I'm not sure. I don't even think it's possible in NoSQL databases because they don't have relations in the traditional sense.
[16:33] tmike: right
[16:33] baudehlo: everything is denormalised.
[16:34] baudehlo: I considered using Couch (and tried really hard) when I was writing some mailing list software for Haraka...
[16:34] mmalecki: Industrial: interesting question
[16:34] tmike: It seems like the going philosophy is to try to dodge relations entirely, right?
[16:34] mmalecki: let me see
[16:34] Industrial: mmalecki: another is if when finding a document it would convert the document structure of the subdocuments back into model instances
[16:34] maritz: tmike: there are libs that do relations on nosql dbs
[16:35] baudehlo: but when it came down to it, if you updated your email address you'd have to go through every list you were a member of and update the address there too. And it just seemed like I was replicating the concepts of a relational db, when I could just use one.
[16:35] mmalecki: Industrial: we actually use Array
[16:35] mmalecki: so I guess it's not that simple
[16:35] Industrial: right
[16:35] tmike: baudehlo: you can't just slap an array of mailing list IDs to each user?
[16:36] baudehlo: tmike: that would be incredibly slow.
[16:36] tmike: I don't know very well the structure of haraka though
[16:36] tmike: indeed
[16:36] Industrial: There's several other ODM's out there like JugglingDB but I don't know the innards of one yet :)
[16:36] arthabaska has joined the channel
[16:36] baudehlo: because you if you get an email to a list, to find who to send it to you'd have to go through every user to see if they had that list.
[16:36] tmike: you'd have to query each user and then see if they were in a list
[16:36] Industrial: I'm using https://github.com/pmlopes/p-odm at work but it's fairly simple
[16:36] maritz: if anyone wants to give a try to a redis orm, i've got nohm :D
[16:37] baudehlo: again, it came down to "why am I trying so hard? This is what relational DBs were built for"
[16:37] tmike: how about attaching a user ID to each list?  I suppose that would require a million and a half queries against the users to get all their addresses at that point
[16:37] tmike: And again, that is exactly what relational DBs are for.
[16:37] RobWC has joined the channel
[16:37] baudehlo: well I'm sure there is probably a way.
[16:37] baudehlo: but I didn't know couch/nosql at all.
[16:37] RobWC has left the channel
[16:38] baudehlo: so I felt like I was fighting against the architecture just to be able to say "I'm using NoSQL".
[16:38] pizthewiz has joined the channel
[16:38] baudehlo: when using postgres was just the right thing to do.
[16:38] CoverSlide: well internally isn't that what the RDBMS's are doing anyways?
[16:38] tmike: I don't know it well at all either.  I'm just asking because I've not dug into nosql enough to have met these problems, so your experience is useful to me.
[16:39] tmike: CoverSlide: I think the difference is that RDBMs have been optimized over however many decades to be really super good at mapping out these requests
[16:39] shanebo has joined the channel
[16:39] CoverSlide: perhaps
[16:40] baudehlo: right. Plus RDBMs' build indexes for this stuff. And have really good query optimisers.
[16:40] tmike: I'm only supposing out loud though, so if I'm wrong I hope someone speaks up ;)
[16:40] tmike: indeed indexes have a lot of strength
[16:40] baudehlo: I think a lot of people use NoSQL because they've bought the kool-aid rather than actually knowing where SQL is good and the real strengths of NoSQL.
[16:41] kokotron has joined the channel
[16:41] CoverSlide: One thing I hate about SQL is SQL
[16:41] tmike: It's nice if you want a simple key/value store with a bit of querying sugar
[16:41] baudehlo: Hehe yeah - see I don't mind SQL.
[16:41] tmike: And that's more than sufficient for a lot of applications
[16:41] baudehlo: But I learned it well about 18 years ago.
[16:41] tmike: I use SQL quite a lot.
[16:42] tmike: again, the whole billions of rows thing
[16:42] baudehlo: This was pretty impressive: http://www.postgresql.fr/en:temoignages:le_bon_coin
[16:42] CoverSlide: I don't like the idea of constantly building a DSL string
[16:42] tmike: DSL string?
[16:42] CoverSlide: I'd prefer to have something more programmatic
[16:42] CoverSlide: SQL is a DSL
[16:42] tmike: Oh forming an SQL query
[16:42] baudehlo: well with NoSQL Javascript is often your "DSL"
[16:42] tmike: yeah, you can get around it pretty well

[16:44] thalll has joined the channel
[16:44] tmike: It's a suitable syntax for what it is.  It needs to be clear and flexible, rather than concise
[16:45] baudehlo: CoverSlide: every language has horrible aspects of syntax. I don't really even see it any more. All I see now is blonde, brunette, redhead.

[16:46] baudehlo: although "let" will mitigate that.
[16:46] tmike: mmm
[16:46] tmike: ES6 is looking pretty hot
[16:46] CoverSlide: couch and mongo use spidermonkey, which already has let
[16:47] baudehlo: I think node does too, right? If you pass certain flags at startup.
[16:47] CoverSlide: right, but not by default
[16:47] tmike: coming from python, [a, b] = (function (a, b) {return [b, a]})(a, b) is pretty attractive
[16:47] baudehlo: --harmony_block_scoping ?
[16:47] CoverSlide: yeah something like that
[16:48] baudehlo: yeah it's a shame you can't do something like: "use strict"; "use harmony_block_scoping";

[16:54] yawNO: benvie: version?
[16:54] chrisjpowers: Hey guys, I'm trying to create an NPM mirror that replicates from the main registry and houses internal NPM packages. I have a CouchDB 1.1.1 instance running and have successfully replicated the registry and pushed the couchapp. Unfortunately, npm adduser seems to be adding user to a "/registry/-" document rather than the _users db. I assume this means the redirects are not working properly -- do I need to install CouchDB 1.2.0?
[16:54] benvie: is this right? wtf
[16:54] mmalecki: benvie: seems disable on node master
[16:54] benvie: 3.9.5
[16:55] CoverSlide: too bad proxies got dropped from harmony
[16:55] mmalecki: wtf?
[16:55] benvie: oh wait nm
[16:55] yawNO: :|
[16:55] mmalecki: they got dropped? why? when?
[16:55] benvie: I think it's my setu-
[16:55] benvie: and no they didn't
[16:55] CoverSlide: they got replaced by "direct proxies"
[16:55] yawNO: they did not drop in harmony
[16:55] yawNO: exactly
[16:55] benvie: oh lol
[16:55] benvie: that's just better proxies
[16:55] CoverSlide: which is a different syntax
[16:55] benvie: way easier to use
[16:56] yawNO: well theyre always proxies
[16:56] benvie: yeah
[16:56] benvie: mostly the same, same semantics basically
[16:56] yawNO: benvie: so what
[16:56] yawNO: are they enabled?

[16:57] benvie: it says default but

[16:57] benvie: it's just cause I have it set to run with the flag always
[16:57] CoverSlide: --harmony_proxies*
[16:57] benvie: I know

[16:57] benvie: that is why this exists: https://github.com/Benvie/Direct-Proxies-Shim-Shim-for-Node-and-Chrome
[16:57] isaacs: chrisjpowers: er, "set up a *vhost"
[16:57] benvie: ;)
[16:58] benvie: doesn't work in chrome anymore cause I don't feel like fixing browser loading

[17:16] maritz: wait, what? what happened to isNaN? or am i missing something here?
[17:17] benvie: it's on Number
[17:17] benvie: and Object.is is stricter equals that returns true for NaN compared to NaN
[17:17] TooTallNate has joined the channel
[17:18] benvie: well technically less strict
[17:18] EhevuTov has joined the channel
[17:18] maritz: booyaa_: wait, what? you're doing an async request at which point you shouldn't return anything (except if you're going for a promise style)
[17:19] bnoordhuis: benvie: isn't a main concept of a NaN that it's unequal to everything, including itself?
[17:19] elijah|home has joined the channel
[17:19] benvie: with strict equals yeah
[17:19] benvie: but that's an issue for some stuff
[17:19] bnoordhuis: .. Nan === NaN
[17:19] bnoordhuis: where's that damn bot?
[17:19] sechrist_: anybody know if an iphone 4s battery fits a 4?
[17:19] benvie: it's still the same
[17:19] benvie: but now you can do Object.is 
[17:20] bnoordhuis: sechrist_: try #churchofsteve
[17:20] benvie: if you need it be equal to itself and for -0 to equal 0
[17:20] benvie: which is important for Maps and WeakMaps
[17:20] ryanj has joined the channel
[17:20] sechrist_: har har
[17:20] benvie: like you can't use indexOf to find NaN in an array because it uses strict equals

[17:22] bnoordhuis: sechrist_: not a demigod?
[17:22] booyaa_: i'm trying to do all the parsing of the body and just return plain text via a function call
[17:22] benvie: it's pretty easy to accidentally fill a Map up with NaN if every usage of it is unique, that's kind of ridiculous really that it works like that

[18:50] stepheneb: bundler has some capabilities that would be very useful for this kind of problem we just had with npm and contextify
[18:50] isaacs: stepheneb: what's that?
[18:50] kriskowal has joined the channel
[18:51] stepheneb: in the ruby gem world as managed by bunder if jsdom and contextify were rubygems ...
[18:51] yawNO has joined the channel
[18:52] stepheneb: and jsdom speced that it would work with 0.1.x of contextify (and assuming that contextify v0.1.2 had been pushed and was bad) then when bundler installs jsdom it would also try and install the bad v0.1.2 of contextify
[18:52] stepheneb: but ... I could spoecify in my Gemfile that I wanted contextify v0.1.1 installed.
[18:53] perezd: must be doing something wrong, when trying to do make pkg osx I get this error: Unable to install the file 'config.h'
[18:53] AbeEstrada has joined the channel
[18:53] stepheneb: bundler would see that AND take a look at jsdoms requirement for 10.1.x and because my more specific request ALSO met jsdoms need I'd get qa working setup
[18:53] perezd: ah I am doing something stupid
[18:53] sbisbee has joined the channel
[18:53] perezd: I've fixed 
[18:54] perezd: bnoordhuis: hey, does the mac installer actually compile stuff or just take the contents of /out/dist-osx and copy it over
[18:54] stepheneb: but with npm even if I install contextify 0.1.1 -- if I also need jsdom it will install it's own version => 0.1.2
[18:55] tmcw has joined the channel
[18:55] EhevuTov has joined the channel
[18:55] bnoordhuis: perezd: there's a makefile target that compiles node and bundles it
[18:56] stepheneb: so as long as I haven't speced something mutually inconsistent bundler will put all of the gems I state I need on the Ruby load path
[18:56] stepheneb: but with npm when jsdom runs it uses it's own copy of contextify
[18:56] perezd: bnoordhuis: I am writing a custom installer
[18:56] perezd: that has node within it
[18:56] stepheneb: d3 which I also use installs it's version of jsdom (whgich has it's version of contextify)

[18:57] jxson_ has joined the channel
[18:58] isaacs: shanebo: sorry, no idea.  i'd have to go digging through the app, and i'm not really familiar with socket.io or bouncy in a deep way
[18:58] isaacs: sbisbee: yes, if a .npmignore file is not present.
[18:58] vguerra has joined the channel
[18:58] stepheneb: as I am understanding more about npm it seems that when I use jsdom -- it gets all of it's dependencies loaded -- but those are separate than those loaded by d3
[18:58] shanebo: isaacs, alright, any idea how to swallow the error though?
[18:59] sbisbee: isaacs: okay, so then that's why my built main.js file isn't landing in the repo :)
[18:59] sbisbee: ty
[18:59] isaacs: stepheneb: npm already works the same as bundler in that regard...
[18:59] sbisbee: isaacs: is an empty .npmignore sufficient to have it skip .gitignore?
[18:59] isaacs: sbisbee: yes.
[19:00] stepheneb: I have a demo starting in just a couple of minutes and the project started breaking about an hour ago ... works now ... just thinking about how I could have worked around this kind of issue much more quickly with bundler
[19:00] isaacs: stepheneb: that's how npm works already, though.
[19:00] isaacs: stepheneb: unless you have an old version or there's been a regression or something.
[19:01] isaacs: but i doubt it.
[19:01] isaacs: stepheneb: you can also use shrinkwrap to lock everything in place.

[19:01] stepheneb: when I look at a tree view of my ./node_modules dir I see multiple copies of jsdome/node_modules/contextify

[19:02] isaacs: stepheneb: or are you using an old version of npm?
[19:02] isaacs: i just tested with 1.1.8 and it works like thi
[19:02] isaacs: *this

[20:35] tmike: congrats, I know you've been working hard to promote it
[20:35] uberbrady: I did a bench with agent: false and it went way faster than any other Agent settings, I think I want to try to override the default implementation and make my own.
[20:35] benvie: thanks =D I need to put some more time into it soon

[20:39] benvie: Mything.prototype = Object.create(Agent)
[20:39] alejandromg has joined the channel
[20:39] benvie: then you can put stuff on it without changing the core one

[20:42] uberbrady: At what point would I want to consider not inheriting, and just re-implementing? Never?
[20:43] uberbrady: Or when I find that I'm working around things more than I am extending them?
[20:43] benvie: you will be inheriting by default
[20:43] benvie: and you override by adding the same named thing to your own
[20:43] benvie: so it's pretty good, you override bit by bit
[20:43] benvie: starting from what works
[20:43] rauchg has joined the channel

[23:30] tilusnet: Hi. Is there a way to cross-compile node-js?
[23:30] copongcopong has joined the channel
[23:30] tilusnet: Unfortunately I am not familiar with the python build tool it uses.
[23:32] maritz: why would you need to be familiar with it?
[23:33] tilusnet: well, perhaps to specify a different build target

[23:34] context: maritz: i have honed the underground art of black magic
[23:34] tilusnet: (the black magic didn't work for me :P)
[23:35] context: i just typed in "cross compile nodejs"
[23:35] maritz: tilusnet: yeah, you need to be authorized by the black hat group of wizards.
[23:35] context: maritz: its not really an authorization though. its more of a certificate that you have learned said art form
[23:36] maritz: right, i wouldn't know, i've only heard rumors

[23:36] context: and its not so much a "group of black hat wizards" its just *they*
[23:37] context: *they* must authorize you

[23:38] papandreou: Any streaming experts around? I'm working on a module that allows you to "hijack" and rewrite an HTTP response, but I'm having troubles with some weird multi-pipe scenarios. Right now I'm wondering whether it makes sense for Stream.prototype.pipe to run cleanup when the destination stream emits the 'end' event: https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/stream.js#L115
[23:39] papandreou: The docs for the 'end' event specifically say that you may be able to keep writing: "Emitted when the stream has received an EOF (FIN in TCP terminology). Indicates that no more 'data' events will happen. If the stream is also writable, it may be possible to continue writing."

[23:42] context: different types of io ports you need to specifically close both streams (recv / trx)

[23:43] zeade has joined the channel
[23:43] papandreou: context: Sure -- but as far as my understanding goes, the 'end' event of the destination stream is irrelevant to whether the pipe should keep going. Seems to me that it only has to do with the "readable stream-ness" of the object :)
[23:43] context: correct.

[23:47] papandreou: context: I have a use case where the same object is a readable and writable stream, but the two don't represent the same socket. The "readable stream part" represents the original request, and the "writable stream part" the rewritten one. Usually the original request ends before the rewritten one, but that breaks pipe.
[23:48] papandreou: context: ... if I'm piping something INTO the object at the moment when the original request ends.

[23:49] context: node is single threaded. you cant send AND recv at the EXACT same time
[23:50] context: its like putting your car in reverse and forward at the same time
[23:50] papandreou: context: I know, I know.
[23:50] papandreou: context: But the pipe is monitoring the events and tears down the pipe when the readable stream emits 'end'.

[23:51] papandreou: context: This is my project btw.: https://github.com/papandreou/express-hijackresponse
[23:51] context: you probably want two pipes? the pipe is doing its job. exactly that. piping the connection. connection dies. pipe does.
[23:52] andrehjr_ has joined the channel
[23:52] papandreou: context: Yeah, one use case is running the original request through a filter using two pipes. That also breaks because of this issue.
[23:54] context: pipes almost seem useless to me personally
[23:54] context: or does the pipe let you catch things
[23:54] context: ive never used pipes myself
