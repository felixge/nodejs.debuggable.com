[00:12] brfelipe: this node app (http://pastebin.com/EQnh2ffW) connects to the server and works on a single browser. if i open it in two browsers, they dont talk to each other... why? im using socket.io
[00:14] tshpaper has joined the channel
[00:16] eddanger has joined the channel
[00:18] Bwen: brfelipe: try #socket.io  I am no expert but I dont think thats how you use it... switch socket.emit for socket.send? and take off chat?  its not on.('chat') but really on.('message')
[00:21] jmoyers: brfelipe you're looking for client.broadcast() on line 14
[00:21] brfelipe: Bwen: yeah. it used to be socket.send until socket.io .7 i think... i still dnt get why the switch, or the difference between send and emit... but on('chat) is also .7...
[00:21] jmoyers: also, you're looking for client.send() in the client side code for submit
[00:21] Bwen: oh okay..
[00:22] jmoyers: ah -- could be that the api has changed

[00:25] jmoyers: broadcast sends to all clients
[00:26] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[00:26] jmoyers: you're emitting on a client object only, also
[00:26] jmoyers: even via the 0.7 api
[00:26] jmoyers: you're after something like: io.sockets.emit('this', { will: 'be received by everyone');

[00:29] brfelipe: jmoyers: but it seems it sends to all browsers but the one that sent the packet :p weird...
[00:29] jmoyers: i'd imagine thats expected
[00:30] jmoyers: append your chat on the client side on the way out
[00:33] brfelipe: jmoyers: id figure .emit would broadcast to everyone, including yourself, and .broadcast.emit to everyone but yourself... i guess you do .emit to send the user who sent the packets some feedback?

[01:13] Nuck: but woah damn it's made up for it in 3 lines of code.
[01:13] hunterloftis: What are everyone's thoughts on designing a purely RESTful API-based web app? (vs a stateful, session-based, traditional rails-y app)
[01:13] Nuck: hunterloftis: I'm doing a RESTful web app right now
[01:13] mcluskydodallas has joined the channel
[01:14] Nuck: Though it *does* have state
[01:14] Nuck: In the form of loggedin
[01:14] hunterloftis: Nuck: So am I - I mean entirely restful though. The client http server and the API http server can be separated
[01:14] cha0s has joined the channel
[01:14] broofa has joined the channel
[01:14] Nuck: hunterloftis: client HTTP server?
[01:14] cha0s has joined the channel
[01:14] hunterloftis: Nuck: Yeah ditto, only the auth token is stored on the client server
[01:14] Nuck: I'm confused.
[01:14] hunterloftis: Nuck: Yeah, basically the API is totally separate from the app server
[01:14] defeated: hunterlofti: this is how I build all of my web apps
[01:15] hunterloftis: Nuck: so the app server is a client of the API
[01:15] Nuck: hunterloftis: Oh, I don't have an app server really
[01:15] Nuck: Though I will build one shortly after launch
[01:15] Nuck: We're doing full AJAX
[01:15] hunterloftis: defeated: I'm interested in the positives/negatives, etc
[01:15] Nuck: But I'm gonna add fallbacks within a week of launch or so
[01:15] hunterloftis: Nuck: Ditto, everything is 100% ajax (data-wise)
[01:15] Nuck: hunterloftis: I mean the client loads directly off my API server
[01:16] defeated: hunterlofti: mostly positives in my experience, it enforces good practices (state === bad, imo)
[01:16] Nuck: I don't have any "state"
[01:16] defeated: hunterlofti: if you were trying to go full on crazy REST, HATEOAS style, it can get a bit complex
[01:16] Nuck: But I have logging in
[01:16] hunterloftis: defeated: that's what I've been finding as well. Starting a new project now and considering whether to duplicate the API architecture
[01:16] Nuck: And that's the extent of my statefulness.
[01:16] Nuck: And it's not required except where something modifies a page on the server, which is done via POST
[01:17] Nuck: or PUT or DELETE
[01:17] defeated: hunterlofti: But I'm more pragmatic when it comes to HATEOAS than some RESTful adherents
[01:17] hunterloftis: defeated: Ours is also a predetermined REST system, there's no figuring out by different clients how shit works. I think that's insane for most practical applications
[01:17] hunterloftis: Nuck - yeah same
[01:17] defeated: hunterlofti: other benefit is your web app is just another app, if you want to add mobile or desktop apps, it's easy to do
[01:17] hunterloftis: defeated: Yeah exactly
[01:18] hunterloftis: defeated: On the other hand, it relies very heavily on JS... but these days, I'm wondering if that even matters
[01:18] Nuck: hunterloftis: I'm gonna have Facebook-esque fallbacks
[01:18] defeated: hunterlofti: if it became a problem you could always use node to push the js to the server ;)
[01:19] Nuck: Where the server wil generate the HTML and serve it if they don't have JS, otherwise, the links will be interrupted by JS and served via AJAX
[01:19] Nuck: The JS will also handle rewriting the URL and such
[01:19] coyo: question :: are there any good books on node.js ?
[01:19] defeated: would love to chat more, but must step away for a bit now~
[01:19] coyo: o/
[01:19] hunterloftis: defeated: cheers
[01:19] coyo: cya defeated
[01:19] coyo: hey all, how be?

[01:20] Nuck: JackDanger: It's all about the ebooks, right?
[01:20] JackDanger: And if that's too basic for you, just fork it and add more :)

[01:37] Aikar: it asked me for user/email then said npm ERR! adduser Error: unauthorized Name or password is incorrect
[01:37] isaacs: Aikar: you may need to reset the password.

[01:37] isaacs: Aikar: http://admin.npmjs.org/reset
[01:38] Aikar: npm upgrade broke it
[01:38] isaacs: Aikar: oh, ok, then it might be the _authCrypt thing?
[01:38] isaacs: Aikar: remove that line from the .npmrc file, and then try to adduser
[01:38] jbc: say I want to make a webapp with many, many small ajax requests - is there a way to pipe them through a persistent connection and so avoid all the setup/teardown?
[01:38] isaacs: Aikar: if that breaks, then reset the pw
[01:38] Aikar: so remove the _auth = line?
[01:38] isaacs: ACTION heading out, email if you stay stuck
[01:38] isaacs: yeah
[01:39] isaacs: Aikar: if you reset the password and remove the _auth line, then you're literally starting over fresh.
[01:39] isaacs: Aikar: as in, then the record is gone from the _users db
[01:39] isaacs: Aikar: do you have any caps or funny chars in your un/pw?
[01:39] Aikar: no
[01:39] isaacs: i think : is the only thing that doesn't work in teh pw
[01:39] isaacs: but the un has to be lowercase now
[01:39] Aikar: i dont even really know what my pw is.. lol
[01:39] isaacs: ok.  yeah, you'd get a different error anyhow.
[01:39] isaacs: heh.  then definitely reset it :)

[03:13] brianc: it's a whole 4 days old. haha
[03:13] chrisdickinson: nice
[03:13] brianc: it's very database centric
[03:13] brianc: hence the "R" in oRm
[03:13] bitwise_: any suggestions on a good json inspector from an external server req
[03:14] chrisdickinson: brianc: definitely; mine's patterned after django's orm, which is a little bit further from the metaphorical action :)
[03:14] willwhite has joined the channel
[03:15] chrisdickinson: the other bit i want to put together is a nice migration library for ormnomnom. i've got some ideas, but the big missing piece is having a library that can register commands / and have other libraries register themselves with those commands

[03:16] AvianFlu has joined the channel
[03:16] brianc: chrisdickinson: yeah I still trying to figure that out too
[03:16] brianc: chrisdickinson: i kinda thinking orm should just be a way to add plugins to a "model" definition
[03:17] brianc: chrisdickinson: so you can add a "migration" plugin, a "sql storage" plugin, a "relationship" plugin, "validation"...etc...
[03:17] chrisdickinson: interesting!
[03:17] brianc: chrisdickinson: because what would be nice is adding a "ajax storage" plugin in the browser & you can use same domain object logic
[03:17] materialdesigner has joined the channel
[03:17] jamescarr: hey, how can I get something by the most recent timestamp using mongoose?
[03:18] brianc: chrisdickinson: but I dunno if this will ever get off the ground. just doing basic now for a client project
[03:18] chrisdickinson: brianc: so your ORM would work both in-browser and out (that would be cool)
[03:18] chrisdickinson: my fork of codysoyland's pieshop aims to do something like that, but it's designed for talking to django-tastypie (an API... API)
[03:18] brianc: chrisdickinson: that's the long-term dream. reuse business logic on both sides (or the parts you want to "plug in" on both sides) and have storage mechanism be swapable.  not sure it's possible
[03:18] bartt has joined the channel
[03:19] chrisdickinson: brianc: the only problem with ormnomnom working in that fashion (thus far) is that i'm using Object.defineProperty to create aliased field names
[03:19] chrisdickinson: (for instance, any primary key field is automatically aliased to `pk` on model instances)
[03:20] brianc: chrisdickinson: that's cool though. sometimes you gain by doing something tailored to 1 environment. I was thinking about having fields define getter & setter methods "get('fieldName')" and "set('fieldName')" 
[03:20] chrisdickinson: i'm probably not going to really-for-true release ormnomnom until i half at least the documentation coverage that node-pg has (not to mention test coverage), though
[03:20] brianc: chrisdickinson: but I think I might just not do dirty-tracking
[03:20] brianc: chrisdickinson: haha thanks. :)
[03:20] brianc: b
[03:21] chrisdickinson: np :)
[03:21] chrisdickinson: my long term goal is that ormnomnom should "swallow" as many async/callback-y bits as possible
[03:22] chrisdickinson: so that between it and my template library, I can write code in a fairly natural way that looks "blocking", but really is just a sleight of hand passing around event emitters.

[03:23] brianc: that's groovies

[03:24] chrisdickinson: oof. yeah.
[03:24] chrisdickinson: i've gotta head for now -- definitely keep in touch re: orm stuff, and keep up the good work!

[06:22] Dreamer3: this is insane
[06:22] sorensen: i love it

[06:22] sorensen: oh i love chrome

[06:23] Dreamer3: i need a dynamic counter
[06:24] Dreamer3: well wait
[06:25] Dreamer3: nope doesn't work because compile can be called multiple times inside itself when the interator is on it's last time thru
[06:25] Dreamer3: so i'm tryiung to use a processing counter

[06:27] mscdex: eek coffeescript
[06:27] Dreamer3: already that is pretty ugly
[06:28] Dreamer3: trying to fix the compiler without rewriting all of it
[06:28] Dreamer3: when you do a join it jsut writes out thee file 20 times inside the loop if you are concating 20 files
[06:28] clvv has joined the channel
[06:28] Dreamer3: but that doesn't work so well if you want to print the output to console
[06:28] svenlito has joined the channel
[06:28] mwhooker has joined the channel
[06:28] Dreamer3: so i need to wait until all the files are loaded, THEN concat and compile
[06:29] mscdex: ok, and the snippet i provided should allow you to do that... 
[06:29] Dreamer3: my count must be off somehow on the processing as it's stuck in an infinite loop... but it's also pretty ugly
[06:29] mscdex: :S
[06:29] mscdex: what is this compiler for anyway?
[06:29] Dreamer3: coffee script
[06:29] mscdex: :o
[06:30] xeodox has joined the channel
[06:30] Dreamer3: the issue is the compile funciton can be called multiple times inside it's last loop
[06:30] Dreamer3: since it can load in entire dirs
[06:30] Dreamer3: so inside it you never really can be sure you're processing the last thing, well not as easily as in your example

[08:11] Tobsn: you said its 127.0.0.1

[08:19] jetienne: :)
[08:19] jetienne: well read the top
[08:19] Tobsn: but it still doesnt make sense that external it would be faster on the same box
[08:19] jetienne: no need to go further
[08:19] jetienne: kill all the 4 first processes
[08:19] Tobsn: hehe
[08:20] Tobsn: whats vino?
[08:20] jetienne: well just the first 100%
[08:20] jetienne: i think this is a gnome desktop stuff. dunno the details

[11:29] Tobsn: thats funny... you know why they didnt had iphones in china for a long time? a friend of mine worked for china mobile and he said that apple came in and wanted them to sell it and told them how much they get per sold phone and china mobile basically kicked them out and apple was pissed about how they acted
[11:29] Tobsn: hehe
[11:29] Tobsn: swilson06, to create it?
[11:29] Tobsn: var x = new array(10)
[11:29] Tobsn: i guess
[11:30] Tobsn: var a = new array((i+10))
[11:30] Tobsn: ?

[11:44] micheil: swilson06: if you want integers from x -> y, like ruby and perl, you'd need to use a loop of some sort, yes.
[11:44] swilson06: and, the work around is obvious: for( var i = 1; i<10; i++) { var a.push(i); }; or something like that
[11:46] swilson06: in perl, not exactly: perl -e 'my @i = ( 1 .. 10 ); print @i, "\n";'

[17:05] tmedema: It seems against the whole point of setting up a cluster of processes.
[17:05] baudehlo: your master sits there and does nothing.

[17:06] Yoric has joined the channel
[17:07] tmedema: baudehlo: zombies? I figured the master would set it's state in something like redis, so that childs detect a master's death and respawn it, after which the master can continue with the saved state
[17:07] tmedema: but if the master does nothing, I assume the chances of it dying are minimal
[17:07] baudehlo: tmedema: this is just how Unix works.
[17:07] tmedema: dieing ?

[17:15] iffy|x200 has joined the channel
[17:15] baudehlo: plus the problem is everyone's environment is different...
[17:15] baudehlo: some people start their daemons via init.d, some via runit, some via daemontools, etc...
[17:16] baudehlo: and management in most places has to be done over ssh, which adds another layer of complexity.
[17:16] CoverSlide: rc.d !

[17:16] Elise001: I want to know more about this sort of thing.
[17:17] tmedema: baudehlo: true, but then again it's a very much wanted feature, especially for bigger companies that wish to achieve high availability for services running on node
[17:17] tmedema: hopefully one will invest in such system, the open source way of course ;)
[17:18] CoverSlide: yes, 'twould be nice
[17:18] baudehlo: well I think nodejitsu open sourced their system for this.

[17:19] tjholowaychuk: tmedema: missed all that. yeah, ideally master would just never die, but it's obviously still pretty new code so it does happen
[17:19] tjholowaychuk: it's best to still have external tools like monit
[17:19] tjholowaychuk: that are battle tested to monitor master
[17:19] baudehlo: or just use runit/daemontools
[17:20] xsyn has joined the channel
[17:20] MarcinM has joined the channel
[17:20] tmedema: tjholowaychuk: alright, what about bidirectional monitoring? in other words, the master does not just monitor childs, but childs also monitor the master (and respawn it if needed, restoring state)
[17:20] tmedema: I guess that could get quite complicated though :)
[17:20] trotter has joined the channel
[17:21] puffpio has joined the channel
[17:21] baudehlo: it's impossible.
[17:21] baudehlo: you can't change the process hierarchy.
[17:21] baudehlo: you can't spawn a parent.
[17:21] tjholowaychuk: you could spawn a new master and kill off the old orphaned children
[17:21] Horofox has joined the channel
[17:21] baudehlo: true.
[17:21] tjholowaychuk: but im more interested in just having master not die
[17:21] tjholowaychuk: haha
[17:21] baudehlo: well kinda...
[17:21] tjholowaychuk: that's how it works on restart
[17:21] tjholowaychuk: you'll have two masters for a moment
[17:22] tmedema: Ah, I did not know that linux only allows hierarchical process structures, so it does not allow for "independent" processes, that do not have parents
[17:22] baudehlo: it doesn't use exec?
[17:22] CoverSlide: how about call the first one master, the second one blaster
[17:22] tjholowaychuk: tmedema you can, if you SIGKILL master you'll still have the orphaned children working
[17:22] bitwise_ has joined the channel
[17:22] baudehlo: but they will be zombies
[17:22] baudehlo: unless you make the children of init.
[17:23] stride: CoverSlide: and call the whole thing thunderdome.js?
[17:23] CoverSlide: exactly
[17:23] baudehlo: s/the/them/
[17:23] stride: CoverSlide: sounds great
[17:23] tmedema: I see, thanks for elaborating on that
[17:23] stride: two processes in, one process out
[17:23] tjholowaychuk: they are just orphaned not zombies
[17:23] baudehlo: hmm, I guess node has no equivalent of exec.
[17:23] MarcinM has left the channel
[17:23] baudehlo: that's kinda annoying.

[17:24] baudehlo: ACTION notes it under the list of missing API methods
[17:24] tmedema: baudehlo: about haibu, it says "haibu is the open-source node.js project for spawning and managing several node.js applications on a single server" : sounds like it is much like cluster, for a "single server"
[17:25] tmedema: it's talking about managing applications, not nodes/servers
[17:25] baudehlo: yeah but they have haibu balancer which does some sort of multi server thingy
[17:25] baudehlo: *shrug* I don't know much about it.
[17:25] CoverSlide: cluster just pre-forks a single app on a single server
[17:25] baudehlo: and I don't do web :)
[17:26] quackquack: whats the best screen scraping library for nodejs?
[17:26] CoverSlide: haibu is for managing multiple apps
[17:26] tjholowaychuk: baudehlo for example depending on the plugins you use (since they will break during IPC) if you SIGKILL master
[17:26] tjholowaychuk: the children can still serve the site
[17:26] tjholowaychuk: haha
[17:26] tjholowaychuk: kinda lame but hey
[17:26] baudehlo: tjholowaychuk: yeah I need to experiment with it and see what happens with Haraka.

[17:28] thalll has joined the channel
[17:28] CoverSlide: baudehlo: when it's reloaded after a code change
[17:29] CoverSlide: using the reload() plugin
[17:29] baudehlo: oh right. I don't enable that feature.
[17:29] tjholowaychuk: no no reload()
[17:29] tjholowaychuk: doesnt matter
[17:29] baudehlo: wouldn't work for Haraka anyway.
[17:29] CoverSlide: yeah, i only use it for dev, not prod
[17:29] tjholowaychuk: on a USR2 it will restart
[17:29] tjholowaychuk: the config / app
[17:29] Murvin: bnoordhuis:  I discover something more about the socket problem.  please see my update in gist. :)
[17:29] baudehlo: Haraka loads plugins via vm
[17:30] temp01 has joined the channel
[17:30] baudehlo: so deleting the require.cache won't do anything for plugins
[17:31] tjholowaychuk: this doesnt do anything with require.cache
[17:31] baudehlo: the reload() plugin doesn't?
[17:31] tjholowaychuk: it's a new process
[17:31] tjholowaychuk: nope
[17:31] baudehlo: ok, but still...
[17:31] baudehlo: it doesn't know when plugin files change.
[17:31] tjholowaychuk: reload() is the same as USR2 but it checks for changes
[17:31] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[17:32] baudehlo: I guess I could make it look in the right dir if reload is in cluster_modules
[17:33] socketio\test\27 has joined the channel
[17:33] baudehlo: still, it's email. It doesn't care if you take it down for a bit.
[17:33] swaj: tjholowaychuk:  question for you.  I have a CSS file that I'm serving up with express using the static connect.  I noticed that any changes I made wouldn't be served for this file until I moved it out and back into the folder.  Browser refresh did nothing... is there something I might have missed?  I literally had to mvoe the file out, Refresh browser to get the 404, and move it back in again 
[17:33] swaj: to get the changes to be picked up.
[17:33] tjholowaychuk: reload() is more for development
[17:33] swaj: the weird part is that other CSS files work fine, it was just this single file.
[17:34] tjholowaychuk: but for a graceful restart you just signal cluster
[17:34] patrickarlt_ has joined the channel
[17:34] tjholowaychuk: swaj  hm... that doesn't make sense
[17:34] CoverSlide: express.static is a connect plugin. i think there's a cache option for it 
[17:34] tjholowaychuk: nope not anymore
[17:34] CoverSlide: no?
[17:34] tjholowaychuk: there's maxAge for http caching
[17:34] tjholowaychuk: but not memory caching
[17:35] swaj: tjholowaychuk: yeah it boggled me.  I would think a browser refresh should cause the file to get reloaded, but I didn't know if there was something I might have missed.
[17:35] tjholowaychuk: strange
[17:35] baudehlo: shift-refresh?
[17:35] tjholowaychuk: that used to be an issue when maxAge was not defaulted to 0
[17:35] CoverSlide: cache clear
[17:36] CoverSlide: new browser?
[17:36] baudehlo: also sniff the connection (http headers or whatever) and see what is being requested/sent.
[17:36] sreeix has joined the channel
[17:36] tbranyen: def sounds like a cache issue
[17:36] swaj: it persisted accross browser sessions -- I even used different browsers.
[17:36] swaj: firefox, chrome, didn't matter
[17:37] CoverSlide: omgwtfbbq
[17:37] CoverSlide: ff5 already released?
[17:37] Ian_Corne: yes
[17:37] tbranyen: CoverSlide: they switched to a new release schedule months ago
[17:37] tjholowaychuk: swaj messed, can you reproduce it with just static()?
[17:38] tmedema: What storage solution should I use to share a scalable application's state inbetween servers (in the same datacenter), redis?
[17:38] CoverSlide: are they doing the chrome thing and upping the number whenever they feel like it?
[17:38] swaj: tjholowaychuk:  I'll try it when I get home tonight.  I'll see if I can get it to do it again.  If necessary I'll give you SSH into my box if you want to try and poke at it once I get it reproduced.

[17:52] mrryanjohnston-e: that's a bad idea, btw. you shouldn't do that
[17:52] CoverSlide: not on prod
[17:52] CoverSlide: just for fun
[17:52] CoverSlide: im a bit ocd when it comes to updates

[17:54] CoverSlide: but anyway, an update-every-6-months distro like ubuntu i don't have the patience for
[17:55] tmedema: I wonder, if node ships to Windows, if it'll have potential for commercial windows applications. I guess one problem is that the application's source has to be included, so anyone could copy the source.
[17:56] CoverSlide: is node gpl?
[17:57] sweetd_ has joined the channel
[17:57] tmedema: Hmm, didn't think about licenses
[17:57] CoverSlide: or do you mean the js source?

[17:57] tmedema: https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/LICENSE
[17:57] CoverSlide: hmm
[17:57] daleharvey: does anyone have an emacs mode that does indentation "the node way"
[17:58] CoverSlide: daleharvey: try js3-mode
[17:58] swaj: node itself is MIT'ed it appears
[17:58] swaj: but its deps are various licenses
[17:59] markwubben has joined the channel
[17:59] tmedema: swaj: would it be possible to bundle and package the entire thing to resell it, with default deps?
[17:59] tmedema: if so, that would create a market for windows applications build with node in the future
[17:59] Bonuspunkt: openssl
[18:00] swaj: everything but OpenSSL within node is either BSD or MIT licensed, so yes
[18:00] tmedema: alright, so then there only is the "source availability" problem
[18:00] bradley has joined the channel
[18:00] swaj: well MIT/BSD licenses are not copyleft
[18:00] swaj: you could close it up and sell it all you want
[18:01] swaj: just have to leave credit/copyright notices in tact
[18:01] swaj: intact*
[18:01] tmedema: aye
[18:01] swaj: you have no obligation to release your contributions
[18:01] tmedema: swaj: no, but node.exe would need to interpret the code
[18:01] tmedema: thus it has to be included in a raw way in some place
[18:02] swaj: sure

[19:07] mikey_p: that's probably not the best use for node

[19:12] catphive: is it possible to eval code within the context of another module?
[19:12] srid has joined the channel
[19:12] catphive: maybe something like with(module) { eval("mycode"); }
[19:12] catphive: the context of this question, is that this would be used in a javascript IDE
[19:13] MooGoo: what exactly do you want to do?
[19:13] catphive: incrementally add things to modules
[19:13] junkee[] has joined the channel
[19:13] catphive: this is for swank-js
[19:13] CoverSlide: you can add values to the exported object
[19:13] MooGoo: module.newfunction = function() { stuff } ?
[19:13] catphive: yes
[19:14] catphive: if possible, I'd like to be able to replace unexported values as well
[19:14] CoverSlide: just us fs.readFile
[19:14] _Sorensen has joined the channel
[19:14] CoverSlide: otherwise, i don't know how you'd have access to exported values
[19:14] CoverSlide: *unexported
[19:15] MooGoo: you want to modify the source code of a module?
[19:15] MooGoo: that's what it sounds like
[19:16] catphive: I want to be able to evaluated new code in the context of a module
[19:16] catphive: so that I can modify it without restarting the process
[19:17] MooGoo: you want access to the scope of a required() module?
[19:17] CoverSlide: the module gets cached anyway, any successive calls to a module will result in the same object returned as the first one
[19:17] catphive: right, I want to modify the cached module
[19:17] MooGoo: do you just want to be able to hotload modules?
[19:17] insin has joined the channel
[19:17] MooGoo: so you can reload them without restarting node
[19:18] CoverSlide: it would be a nice feature but afaik not supported
[19:18] MooGoo: there are modules out there for that
[19:18] catphive: not so much reloading the module, I want to keep its existing state
[19:18] MooGoo: or you can just delete the proper key in the require file cache
[19:18] CoverSlide: i think they just restart node transparently
[19:18] MooGoo: nah
[19:18] MooGoo: I mean I wrote one myself, it just reads teh file and evals it
[19:18] MooGoo: that's what require does
[19:19] raZer_: how can we write a c or c++ module for node js? Most of the modules are written in Java Script itself.. But I have seen some having c support. Does node's require() also loads the c programs?
[19:19] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[19:19] MooGoo: catphive, you cant really access the scope of any arbitrary js functio 
[19:19] MooGoo: n
[19:19] MooGoo: that's why they call it private
[19:19] CoverSlide: yeah you can roll your own if you want
[19:19] Aria: raZer_: Yes, it does -- they're generally .node files, a shared object in whatever form your OS expects.
[19:19] catphive: maybe I need to look at how require looks
[19:19] catphive: works
[19:20] MooGoo: require loads the specified file as a string, wraps it in (function(exports, require, module) { ...code...})(exports, require, module)
[19:20] MooGoo: runs it that way
[19:20] MooGoo: also caches
[19:21] raZer_: hmm.. i was wondering if it is possible to use libraries written for node that are CommonJs compatible to use for my custom v8 program
[19:21] defeated: raZer_: Here's some slides from nodeconf that talk about how to build a native extension: http://marcorogers.com/nodeconf-2011/node_addons_presentation.html
[19:21] catphive: interesting
[19:21] raZer_: i wrote a simple require .. that works but now interested in doing the same for c library.. wondering how node does it
[19:21] raZer_: wonderful... ill look at that
[19:22] CoverSlide: oo me likey
[19:22] MooGoo: I still want to find out how to write a node/v8 extension that exposes the scope chain
[19:22] CoverSlide: the chrome bookmark syncing totally replaces my need for delicious / stumbleupon / etc
[19:23] CoverSlide: Probably have to modify the runtime
[19:23] MooGoo: have to do something tricky
[19:23] MooGoo: I'd hope it doesnt involve changing the source of v8
[19:23] raZer_: hmm.. ill keep posting my findings somewhere and link it here .. may be people can give feedback..
[19:23] CoverSlide: just slip it into a pull request
[19:23] MooGoo: the scope chain is a real JS internal object

[19:31] CoverSlide: doesn't npm require node?

[19:52] CoverSlide: why would it matter?

[19:59] tbranyen: binding to libinotify or something?
[19:59] Horofox: yes.
[20:00] Horofox: https://github.com/c4milo/node-inotify

[20:00] Horofox: it comes installed with linux :)
[20:01] tbranyen: Horofox: hmm pretty sure i had to install that, maybe i didn't
[20:01] Horofox: but i did install stuff like inotify tools and so on(even tho i dont need it)
[20:01] tbranyen: or i'm thinking of some other notification tool

[20:02] Horofox: yea
[20:02] Horofox: but on my pc it works.
[20:02] baudehlo: don't do that.
[20:02] Horofox: with node 0.5
[20:02] baudehlo: I stand by what I said.
[20:03] jameson has joined the channel
[20:03] tbranyen: yeah i dunno why people use unstable versions and wonder why stuff isn't working
[20:03] c4milo: Horofox: hum, do you have some gist to take look at? 
[20:03] sharkbone: is there anyway i can parse a huge text file (3gig) from linux to php array
[20:04] Horofox: c4milo: oh, a celebrity here!
[20:04] Horofox: wait
[20:04] c4milo: Horofox: node-inotify hasn't been tested with node 0.5.x since it is still an unstable version, you might run into weird issues  
[20:04] Horofox: oh
[20:04] baudehlo: tbranyen: until I changed it, the install instructions recommended pulling git HEAD.
[20:04] hwinkel1 has joined the channel
[20:05] c4milo: Horofox: the latest stable version of node is 0.4.8  
[20:05] tbranyen: baudehlo: so what, the instructions could tell me to stick my hand in a blender
[20:05] tbranyen: its still not a good idea ;-)
[20:05] josephboyle has joined the channel
[20:05] Horofox: c4milo: it feels strange because it runs ok in local, but not in my server.
[20:05] baudehlo: right now there needs to be a big red flashing warning sign on HEAD that says DO NOT USE THIS, EVER
[20:05] Horofox: c4milo: both with the same node versions and so on
[20:06] tbranyen: baudehlo: well presumably someone uses it to test
[20:06] tbranyen: i want to try my git bindings in HEAD
[20:06] baudehlo: node core developers, sure.
[20:06] tbranyen: see what happens other than frying my cpu
[20:06] baudehlo: but it's horribly unstable right now.
[20:06] shajith_ has joined the channel
[20:06] tbranyen: yeah no doubt with all that libuv stuff going on

[20:07] c4milo: Horofox: I just saw you mentioned node-inotify 
[20:07] Horofox: c4milo: when i run it on my pc, it runs.
[20:07] baudehlo: Horofox: honestly it doesn't matter if it works somewhere on 0.5.0, just downgrade to v0.4.8 and *then* see if it works, and check here again.
[20:07] baudehlo: 0.5.0 is broken. Things are guaranteed not to work.
[20:07] Horofox: c4milo: but when i try to run it on my server, it stops.
[20:08] Horofox: c4milo: and yea, it's the inotify sample.
[20:08] willwhite has joined the channel
[20:08] Horofox: the example of use that is on your github
[20:08] c4milo: Horofox: any exception? 
[20:08] Horofox: c4milo: none, it just closes, like...
[20:08] Horofox: root@li159-108:/home/thi/thi# node node_thumb.js     root@li159-108:/home/thi/thi# 
[20:09] baudehlo: Horofox: this points to an event loop problem, which points to you not following the advice I gave, because v0.5.0's event loop is undergoing massive changes right now.
[20:09] Horofox: instead of running properly
[20:09] Horofox: baudehlo: but it works on my pc with the same node version!!!
[20:09] baudehlo: so what?
[20:09] Horofox: baudehlo: that's strange?
[20:09] baudehlo: it's obviously different somehow.
[20:10] baudehlo: compiled different, things installed different, OS different.
[20:10] jerrysv: horofox: same node version, same os version, same kernel version, same version of every single library?

[20:10] c4milo: Horofox: does you server have the same Linux distribution as your desktop?
[20:10] jerrysv: horofox: then try 0.4.8 :)
[20:11] c4milo: Horofox: exactly :) 
[20:11] baudehlo: Horofox: I'm just saying, if it breaks on v0.4.8 at least you're not sending someone on a wild goose chase looking for breakage.
[20:11] thalll has joined the channel
[20:11] Horofox: c4milo: yes, my desktop distribution is ubuntu 11.04 and the server is ubuntu 10.04 
[20:11] c4milo: Horofox: that's a big difference 
[20:11] Horofox: baudehlo: i'm going to try with 0.4.8 then
[20:11] jerrysv: horofox: that's a pretty big difference, that's a lot of variables.  how about eliminating a couple of those?
[20:12] mikeal has joined the channel
[20:12] Horofox: c4milo: it's strange because it feels that it's just inotify related because node.js runs well on both.
[20:12] Horofox: c4milo: is there any way to check if inotify is alright on both systems?
[20:12] c4milo: Horofox: what does it run well? 
[20:13] c4milo: Horofox: they only way to know if it runs well is if you have a service running for weeks and it continues working well.
[20:13] jerrysv: horofox: it could be, there may be some part of inotify that does not play well with the latest kernel, or some latest lib, and bleeding edge node
[20:13] Horofox: c4milo: i have a ~1k loc server using like 15 libs and i'm only having a problem in the inotify part
[20:13] gkmngrgn has joined the channel
[20:13] Horofox: c4milo: so i tried to run the inotify sample and it didn't run.
[20:14] Horofox: so it's probably a problem with inotify in my server, but how to fix it?
[20:14] tbranyen: jerrysv: i'm on a pretty latest kernel
[20:14] tbranyen: worked alright here
[20:14] jerrysv: tbranyen: i was just pointing out all of the possible variables :)
[20:14] tbranyen: yeah just saying
[20:14] tbranyen: on .39 and its alright
[20:15] tbranyen: i dunno when arch is gonna pick up 3
[20:15] Horofox: jerrysv: probably... i'm going to take a look at everything
[20:15] Horofox: jerrysv: going to begin by downgrading my node.js version
[20:16] shinuza has joined the channel
[20:16] baudehlo: doesn't inotify require some sort of daemon running?
[20:17] baudehlo: I seem to recall.
[20:17] Horofox: that's what i want to know...
[20:17] c4milo: Horofox: that's a good way to start with. You can also use process.on('uncaughtException', function(e) {}) to catch the exception that it's throwing 
[20:17] bnoordhuis: baudehlo Horofox: no
[20:17] c4milo: baudehlo: nop
[20:18] c4milo: baudehlo: inotify is a kernel library, the kernel itself sends to you the fs events
[20:18] Horofox: damn everything looks so pretty in my pc :(
[20:18] baudehlo: ah ok. Then inotify had a predecessor that did?
[20:19] baudehlo: fam?
[20:19] baudehlo: ACTION is used to BSDs and kqueue which works for file change notification natively
[20:20] c4milo: baudehlo: the predecessor was dnotify 
[20:20] Horofox: c4milo: node-inotify is awesome btw!
[20:20] bnoordhuis: baudehlo: predecessor to inotify was dnotify but that was also a kernel API
[20:20] Horofox: c4milo: :)

[20:39] hydrozen: i think the request to the socket security is pretty transparent
[20:39] jerrysv: hydrozen: socket.io should automatically start up on port 843 as well, to serve the policy file, you shouldn't need to do that

[20:40] hydrozen: and it still didnt work
[20:41] jerrysv: hydrozen: and you're using <script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>  on the client side?
[20:42] gde33 has joined the channel
[20:43] hydrozen: jerrysv: yes, but the js is required even if open the socket through Flash?

[20:44] jerrysv: socket.io has its own heartbeat system
[20:45] zivester has joined the channel
[20:45] hydrozen: how will it serve it for me on the client side? shouldnt the policy file be on the remote nodejs server?
[20:46] xerox: pquerna: if you wrote that you should correct the typo
[20:46] jerrysv: hydrozen: it is on the remote nodejs server, the same one serving up the javascript file

[20:49] hydrozen: jerrysv: I'm not sure I get what you are saying. I've downloaded a copy of the client side socket.io, and installed it on my rails app that i run locally. I'm only loading the socket.io.min file
[20:49] tenumm: junkee[]: Attachment is my custom C++ Object so its defined more line Attachment: public ObjectWrap
[20:50] hydrozen: jerrysv: and thats what I load on the client side... even though my feeling is I don't need to load that js file since i want to use Flash to connect to the socket
[20:50] jerrysv: hydrozen: socket.io is a client/server solution, meant to be run as part of node.js

[20:53] hydrozen: jerrysv: well, they use Flash as a Flashback for browsers that dont support sockets.
[20:53] hydrozen: so im guessing i could just use flash to connect to the socket.io socket on the nodejs side
[20:54] hydrozen: we're buldling a flash app that requires socket connections, I thought nodejs would be perfect for this on the server side
[20:54] hydrozen: flashback == fallback

[20:54] jerrysv: rauchg: you around?
[20:54] `3rdEden: hydrozen sure, its possible
[20:55] `3rdEden: but you need to work with the protocol on top of Socket.io
[20:55] jerrysv: hydrozen: possible, but socket.io adds a heartbeat every few seconds
[20:55] `3rdEden: and you need to make sure you connect with our flashsocket policy file server
[20:55] madmike1029 has joined the channel
[20:55] hydrozen: `3rdEden: which server is this
[20:55] `3rdEden: hydrozen socket.io uses > https://github.com/gimite/web-socket-js as flash fallback
[20:56] MatthewS has joined the channel
[20:56] `3rdEden: there are some flashfiles in there that will allow you to create your own websocket connect

[20:56] tenumm:  Hello Noders - I am trying to return the JS object via Handle<Value> Attachment::getNamedProperty(v8::Local<v8::String> property, const AccessorInfo& info) {//return attachment object }. How I can do that ?
[20:56] madmike1029 has left the channel
[20:56] jerrysv: hydrozen: and the heartbeat is in the format: ~h~[\d+]
[20:56] `3rdEden: there is also a old flashsocketio project that is build ontop of socket.io 0.6
[20:56] `3rdEden: with support of the protocl of 0.6
[20:56] `3rdEden: so you can take alook at that and see how its implemented
[20:57] `3rdEden: https://github.com/simb/FlashSocket.IO
[20:57] hydrozen: ok
[20:57] hydrozen: but so
[20:57] hydrozen: im guessing it might be simpler
[20:57] hydrozen: for the Flash to raise javascript events
[20:58] jbpros has joined the channel
[20:58] hydrozen: and so i would use javascript for the sockets on the client side
[20:58] `3rdEden: probalby, if you dont' want to go through all the trouble of building your own flash implementation of the socket.io protocol
[20:58] hydrozen: and send messages to the Flash file to do shit
[20:59] sfragis has joined the channel
[20:59] tenumm: Noders any clue how to return JS Object via "Handle<Value> Attachment::getNamedProperty(v8::Local<v8::String> property, const AccessorInfo& info) {//return attachment object }"
[21:00] `3rdEden: hydrozen so, do you still need you question posted onthe socket.io google groups
[21:00] jerrysv: tenumm: maybe with a v8:object ?  http://bespin.cz/~ondras/html/classv8_1_1Object.html
[21:00] `3rdEden: as it's still pending :)

[21:03] tenumm: jerrysv: Thanks. Are there any example of using that? I learned from the examples that you can return JS object via "Handle<Value> BusAttachment::New(const Arguments &args) { attachment->Wrap(args.This()); return args.This()}
[21:03] hydrozen: `3rdEden: hehe maybe not. But so you are positive that to get Flash to talk to the socket I'm going to have a hard time because its not the same as other sockets?
[21:03] tenumm: jerrysv: But with above example we don't have args as an argument passed to function 
[21:03] jerrysv: tenumm: sadly, no. i've only returned the standards: string, buffer, null, undefined
[21:03] `3rdEden: Well hydrozen I tested the flashsocket (that we bundle with socket.io as one of the fallbacks) and it works like a charm

[21:04] hydrozen: This guy had it working... http://www.giantflyingsaucer.com/blog/?p=952

[21:04] TroyMG has joined the channel
[21:04] hydrozen: `3rdEden: yeah, i mean, worst case, i can just use externalInterface and talk to my flash app via javascript.
[21:04] tenumm: jerrysv: ahh! I see. Even more sadly I can't find example in modules doing similar thing
[21:05] `3rdEden: hydrozen he uses XMLSocket
[21:05] `3rdEden: our flashfallback uses FlashSocket
[21:05] daleharvey: mikeal: hitting a weird problem with request - http://pastie.org/2113039
[21:05] dgathright has joined the channel
[21:05] `3rdEden: theres a big difference between the both of those
[21:05] daleharvey: any external requests get that error, any requests to localhost work
[21:06] hydrozen: `3rdEden: using FlashSocket instead would work? or there'd still be a need to implement a lot of stuff to get it working?
[21:06] hydrozen: because if its too complicated, i'll just have a javascript interface on top of my flash app
[21:06] Yoric has joined the channel
[21:06] mikeal: weird
[21:06] `3rdEden: hydrozen why don't you copy the code from https://github.com/simb/FlashSocket.IO
[21:06] mikeal: i wonder if that is due to the last fix i took
[21:06] mikeal: what are you doing daleharvey?
[21:07] bnoordhuis: tenumm: accessors are wrappers around properties, not functions, so there are no arguments
[21:07] `3rdEden: it has swc and ac files ready to be used
[21:07] pjacobs: `3rdEden, you seem up to speed with socket.io. Do you have an opinion on sessions and socket.io? I have an app I'm working on that could use sessions at the socket layer.
[21:07] daleharvey: writing a data adapter type thing for couch, I just have a database with a bunch of jobs specified, and node goes and checks the job queue, fetches data, and chucks it in couch
[21:07] `3rdEden: pjacobs I actually just created a pull request for that a couple of hours ago
[21:07] `3rdEden: that will allow you to read out the header
[21:08] `3rdEden: of a connection
[21:08] `3rdEden: So you can just check cookie headers etc
[21:08] `3rdEden: It should probably land with Socket.IO 0.7.3
[21:08] `3rdEden: which we hopefully will release soon :p
[21:08] pjacobs: I'll check it out. Thanks

[21:11] Charuru: well actually thanks for everything in socket.io and all
[21:11] tenumm: bnoordhuis: Thanks. In that case how I can return a custom JSObject (in my case Attachment) if a call is made to new property. for example if I do myObject[newproperty] = {JSON} (in C++ I will take this JSON and create corresponding C++ Object) and when you do "var returnObject = bus[newproperty] " I need that C++ object back as JS object"

[21:18] bnoordhuis: tenumm: and here is how you instantiate it: https://github.com/bnoordhuis/node-iconv/blob/cbc472a/iconv.cc#L165
[21:18] thejh: mikeal, are you here?
[21:18] mikeal: daleharvey: fix is pushed to npm

[21:18] Charuru: I'm trying to decide whether I should build on top of it, or just steal what I need
[21:18] Charuru: hmm
[21:18] bnoordhuis: tenumm: and note how the JS object is glued to the C++ object here: https://github.com/bnoordhuis/node-iconv/blob/cbc472a/iconv.cc#L26

Thus, you can't use it even socket is free. and it will stuck there. "

[22:06] bnoordhuis: Murvin: memory == objects, so it wouldn't surprise me if in some edge cases resources aren't being reclaimed
[22:07] Murvin: bnoordhuis:  :)   is the complains in Issues?

[22:08] bnoordhuis: Murvin: you mean the valgrind error log? no
[22:09] bnoordhuis: Murvin: i haven't had the time to delve in deeper - could be that it's just v8 / node being shut down too fast to reclaim the objects
