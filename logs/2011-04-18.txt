[00:16] asdfsafdsa: Hello, I asked this before but I fell asleep before I got an answer. How do I turn an async function into a sync one? Just trying to make this module a bit more convinient for those who want it sync'd.
[00:17] llkazu: I'm not really sure thats possible

[00:22] micheil: ininimo
[00:22] micheil: mikeal^
[00:22] secoif: if they want it synced they can use something like the Step or Do libs
[00:23] asdfsafdsa: secoif: okay.
[00:24] secoif: asdfsafdsa: kills much of the nodejs benefit 
[00:24] secoif: also see this http://bjouhier.wordpress.com/2011/04/04/currying-the-callback-or-the-essence-of-futures/
[00:25] secoif: currying can help control flow as well.
[00:25] leepowers has joined the channel
[00:25] asdfsafdsa: secoif: yes it does. node is all about being async. but a lot of it's core functions have sync versions so I thought some people might prefer that.
[00:26] micheil: asdfsafdsa: is it logical for your code to run in a sync manner?
[00:27] sugyan: :q
[00:27] leepowers: What is process.binding('evals').Script used for?
[00:27] leepowers: loading in additional js at runtime?
[00:27] secoif: actually, I don't understand why there  are sync version
[00:28] asdfsafdsa: micheil: yes, I can see someone wanting to run it sync'd. the function accesses a page on the internet and returns values from what it reads.
[00:28] micheil: asdfsafdsa: you know that there is no synchronous network i/o in node?
[00:28] micheil: there's only synchronous file i/o
[00:29] asdfsafdsa: secoif: I've used the sync version of file system functions quite a few times. it doesn't accept performance if they're used when the script is first loaded and never again.
[00:29] secoif: asdfsafdsa: that sounds spot on like something you'd want async
[00:29] mscdex: asdfsafdsa: you'll notice it's just the file system methods that have sync counterparts
[00:30] mscdex: mostly for that reason, reading stuff at startup

[01:11] mscdex: yoohoo: the box i tried it on has only 1
[01:11] yoohoo: that does seem to be the case
[01:11] yoohoo: on my vm with a single interface, it works.  on my machine with 2 it doesnt
[01:12] boaz has joined the channel
[01:13] jtsnow has joined the channel
[01:14] mscdex: yoohoo: maybe broadcasting to 255.255.255.255 doesn't cross subnets or isn't routed to other networks or something like that
[01:14] mscdex: not sure what to tell you
[01:14] yoohoo: ah wait, its broadcasting on my other interface
[01:14] yoohoo: the internet side
[01:14] yoohoo: :|
[01:15] mscdex: heh
[01:15] yoohoo: well shit, im not sure how to get it to pick the other without using the subnet's broadcast
[01:15] yoohoo: but i dont think there is a way to detect that is there?
[01:16] mscdex: well, there was a patch to allow specifying of an interface for tcp client connections

[01:22] andrewfff has joined the channel
[01:23] yoohoo: yeah that seems to force it onto that interface
[01:24] yoohoo: how do i bind to recieve broadcasts without recieving them for both interfaces?
[01:24] yoohoo: 0.0.0.0 gives me broadcasts across both interfaces, 192.168.1.0 doesn't recieve them
[01:27] mscdex: looks like you can do it on linux at least, with the SO_BINDTODEVICE socket option
[01:27] mscdex: not sure about other platforms
[01:28] yoohoo: i suppose if i used bindtodevice, i wouldnt need the .bind
[01:28] mscdex: i'd say so
[01:29] mscdex: yoohoo: post a message about adding it to the dgram module on the nodejs-dev mailing list and hopefully it'll get added
[01:29] mscdex: submitting a patch and a test will make the chances greater :)

[02:37] isaacs: it's probably not the worst thing about the http spec, but it's near the top of the list.
[02:38] Baby-28: http://www.erzurumoltutasi25.tr.gg/
[02:38] Aria: I can't believe the IETF standardized on CRLF.
[02:38] isaacs: yeah, so weird
[02:38] Aria: It makes me slightly crazy.
[02:38] isaacs: did they think that people would actually read http on raw-mode terminals?
[02:38] isaacs: srsly, why?  it makes zero sense.
[02:38] Aria: No, but it predates HTTP
[02:38] Aria: HTTP just did what was normal.
[02:38] Aria: FTP and SMTP both specify CRLF too.
[02:39] isaacs: ew.
[02:39] mscdex: Aria: NNTP uses it too
[02:39] Aria: And those WERE expected to be done on raw terminals in the bad old days.
[02:39] kkaefer: imap as well
[02:39] mscdex: yep
[02:39] Aria: Yeah. But again with IMAP just following the normal ways. And NNTP is just crazy in so many ways.
[02:39] isaacs: yeah, basically, tcp protocols, and windows.
[02:39] isaacs: put \r all over the damn place.
[02:39] Aria: Yep.
[02:39] mscdex: nntp is crazy
[02:39] ChrisPartridge: mscdex, isaacs: this is all I have in the file https://gist.github.com/924721

[02:41] Nexxy: clearly the solution is a hybridized crlf character
[02:41] isaacs: the thing is, you do actually need a separate \r and \n when you're writing to a terminal.
[02:41] isaacs: "go down" and "go to col 0" are different control sequences
[02:41] Nexxy: ChrisPartridge, aren't you 'sposed to declare a function before you call it? ;\
[02:41] isaacs: but a file isn't a sheet of paper.
[02:42] isaacs: Nexxy: functions are hoisted

[03:51] marcello3d: also works
[03:51] marcello3d: rather, also gets the same error
[03:51] marcello3d: whereas console.log(global) does not
[03:52] marcello3d: jed___: I'd create an issue on github with the test case console.log([global]) generating that exception
[03:52] gmarcus: by default, npm now installs into current folders node_modules.  So in my current folder, I get a node_modules/node.io.  How do I run node.io?
[03:52] jed___: the test case is just this, right? node -e "console.log([global])"
[03:52] mikeal: i'm updating my local node
[03:53] mikeal: it's currently like a branch of v0.4 i was working on around 0.4.3
[03:53] mikeal: we're still pulling from the v0.4 branch right?
[03:53] marcello3d: jed___: yep, interestingly it gives a more specific error when you run that
[03:54] mikeal: ok, so the question is: is it an error due to one of the global properties
[03:54] jed___: marcello3d: good catch!
[03:54] mikeal: or is it a bug in the code that traverses it

[03:54] mikeal: because console.log/dir is suppose to handle circular refs
[03:54] Emmanuel__: v8bot: <code>{}=={}</code>

[03:55] mikeal: did that change recently?
[03:55] marcello3d: which doesn't make sense
[03:55] marcello3d: everything should be convertible to a string, no? so it must be something in native code?
[03:55] secoif: have some strange thing going on, so I'm like cool, I'll debug that, but no luck. Even if it's not the eclipse V8 tools, just any way to step through my expresso tests would be handy

[03:59] mikeal: ok, do you two want to gist console.log(global)
[03:59] marcello3d: Emmanuel__: they're technically two different objects
[03:59] mikeal: so that we can check for differences
[03:59] marcello3d: console.log(global) works fine for me
[03:59] marcello3d: it's only the [] that screws it up
[03:59] jed___: marcello3d: try it from the REPL. it'll work.
[04:00] marcello3d: depends on your definition of "work"
[04:00] mikeal: wtf happened to console.log/dir
[04:00] marcello3d: > console.log([global])
[04:00] marcello3d: [ {} ]
[04:00] marcello3d: looks like ascii porn
[04:00] marcello3d: ahem
[04:00] jed___: marcello3d: well, it won't throw, heh.
[04:00] mikeal: it used to print like, useful shit
[04:00] Emmanuel__: v8: (Object.keys({}) == Object.keys({}))
[04:00] v8bot: Emmanuel__: false
[04:00] marcello3d: right, but that's not the same object
[04:00] marcello3d: that I get when I do node -e "console.log(global)"
[04:00] marcello3d: so the repl probably has some different global
[04:01] marcello3d: repl seriously needs to support exit/quit

[04:01] gmarcus: can someone help me get node.io running with npm v1.0.1rc9 ?
[04:02] marcello3d: Emmanuel__: basically you want deep equals, which javascript doesn't have built in
[04:02] marcello3d: but if you're looking for an empty object, Object.keys(foo).length == 0 should work
[04:03] Emmanuel__: oh, thx
[04:03] marcello3d: or, var isEmpty=true; for (var x in object) { isEmpty = false; break }
[04:03] Emmanuel__: (the other solution I found on the internet are sound, but not very elegant)
[04:03] Emmanuel__: (I want something simple, for a simple test)
[04:03] marcello3d: yea
[04:03] marcello3d: some of the test libraries provide deep equals assertions
[04:03] marcello3d: like vowsjs

[04:07] Aikar: isaacs: this cant be considered ok :/ if a depends on b, if i install a then b, both end up in node_modules/{a,b} as desired. but if you just install b, a ends up in node_modules/b/node_modules/a - really need to flatten left
[04:07] marcello3d: Aikar: technically it should end up in both
[04:08] Aikar: it doesnt
[04:08] marcello3d: if b depends on a
[04:08] Aikar: in this case i did npm install joosex-class-singleton
[04:08] marcello3d: it'll install a copy of a in b
[04:08] marcello3d: regardless of if you have a installed or depend on it
[04:08] Aikar: thats just an extension where you need to still do require('joose')
[04:08] mikeal: i don't see anything obvous
[04:08] marcello3d: assuming you're using 1.0
[04:08] no-gooder: Aikar,  you saw my message?
[04:08] Aikar: no-gooder: nope
[04:08] marcello3d: if you're not using 1.0 nevermind :)
[04:09] no-gooder: Aikar, would you check this please if i'm doing wrond? : http://jsfiddle.net/VRWYE/2/
[04:09] Aikar: marcello3d: if you do install joose, then install joosex-singleton, you get nm/joose and nm/joosex and joose does not land in nm/joosex/nm/joose
[04:09] jetheredge has joined the channel
[04:09] Aikar: which is all it NEEDS
[04:09] marcello3d: does joosex depend on joose?
[04:10] Aikar: imo, putting dependencies in nm/bar/nm/foo should only be done if it has a "max version" requirement
[04:10] niftylettuce: hunterloftis: have you integrated with html5 boilerplate?
[04:10] Aikar: yes, but cant use joosex without a plain require("joose") lol
[04:10] Aikar: so youd still have to npm install joose
[04:10] marcello3d: npm ERR! 404 'joosex-singleton' is not in the npm registry.
[04:10] ryan[WIN] has joined the channel
[04:10] Aikar: sorry i abbreviated
[04:10] Aikar: joosex-class-singleton
[04:10] marcello3d: ok
[04:11] marcello3d: so I just tried it and it installed two copies of joose
[04:11] hunterloftis: niftylettuce: No, since node+express tends to use templating languages (like jade) html boiler plate wouldn't be the fastest starting point for most projects (imho)

[04:12] marcello3d: after running npm install joose, npm install joosex-class-singleton
[04:12] Aikar: your using old npm
[04:12] Aikar: im on rc9
[04:13] marcello3d: aha
[04:13] Aikar: oh and you installed them sep
[04:13] marcello3d: so a regression in rc8->rc9?
[04:13] Aikar: thats what i meant, i meant you HAVE to issue 2 commands
[04:13] marcello3d: I'm confused
[04:13] marcello3d: but npm -g update just broke my npm :D
[04:13] Aikar: when it seems silly that joosex depends on joose, the whole point of auto dependency installation is so you dont have to install the chain seperately
[04:14] marcello3d: you don't
[04:14] Aikar: in this case you do
[04:14] Aikar: if you npm install joosex
[04:14] marcello3d: installing joosex-class-singleton should be enough if all you want is joosex-class-singleton
[04:14] Aikar: you cant do require('joose')
[04:14] marcello3d: of course not
[04:14] marcello3d: because you don't depend on it
[04:14] marcello3d: what if joosex gets rewritten
[04:14] marcello3d: to not depend on joose and not even use it
[04:14] marcello3d: that shouldn't break your project
[04:15] marcello3d: in this example that might seem silly, but imagine others where they aren't so related
[04:15] jetheredge has left the channel
[04:15] Aikar: i look at npm as a tool to get libs into my folder :P 
[04:15] Aikar: im more concerned with the fact it cOULD be flattened in this case
[04:15] marcello3d: well, you should be defining your dependencies in package.json
[04:15] marcello3d: then you just do npm install and be done with it
[04:16] marcello3d: that way if you check out your code onto a fresh comp/folder, you don't have to remember what you installed
[04:16] Aikar: i know all that, just would rather it flatten left
[04:16] Aikar: and not waste space installing multiple copies of the same lib
[04:16] marcello3d: that's a separate issue
[04:17] marcello3d: npm might not be right for you in that case :)
[04:17] marcello3d: how big are these libraries?
[04:17] Aikar: of course npm is right, i just think its odd it behaves differently based on order :P
[04:18] Aikar: if you install joose then joosex, no duplication occurs
[04:18] marcello3d: that is odd
[04:18] marcello3d: but that didn't happen with mine
[04:18] marcello3d: so it might be a regression in rc9
[04:18] marcello3d: let me install the latest
[04:19] Aikar: npm ls shows the tree like that
[04:19] Aikar: but the folders dont really lay out like that
[04:19] Aikar: if you look in your joosex folder, you wont have a node_modules
[04:20] perezd: whats a good way to test if an event doesn't get fired in a test case?
[04:20] marcello3d: ok I'm on 1.0.1rc9

[04:20] Aikar: https://gist.github.com/c91cc51fc3ab360f663b
[04:20] Aikar: mine also shows the same thing

[04:21] marcello3d: problem solved
[04:21] Aikar: if a module does not have a "max version requirement"

[04:21] Aikar: if it has a max ver, then embed it in that modules nm folder
[04:22] pyrotechnick has joined the channel
[04:22] marcello3d: right
[04:22] marcello3d: so it does that, but not if you manually install in the reverse order

[04:22] marcello3d: and do a `npm install`
[04:22] pyrotechnick: SubStack: what npm do you use? i have tried dnode locally/globally on 1.0.1rc9 but i'm not having much luck

[05:03] ryah: there's probably a way to pull my --cov hack out of node...
[05:03] llkazu: github charges money for private repositories?
[05:03] llkazu: lol
[05:03] Nexxy: Aikar, private projects that you don't want to pay for hosting on?
[05:03] Aikar: i guess, but its so trivial to host your own repo lol
[05:04] Nexxy: that's what i'm sayin'
[05:04] llkazu: sureâ€¦ butâ€¦ bitbucket and github do backups and have a far more reliable infra.
[05:04] llkazu: :-p
[05:04] Nexxy: I can do backups!
[05:04] Aikar: if my server goes down, thats still a serious issue i gotta resolve
[05:04] llkazu: sure, but you could also spend that time devving.
[05:04] llkazu: :-p
[05:04] indutny1: ryah: around?
[05:05] llkazu: anyway, i guess my question is, anyone using mercurial that wants to help me test my silly-ass hosting platform?
[05:05] Nexxy: llkazu, it's liek 20 minutes worth of work!
[05:05] mscdex: just do like linus does and have everyone mirror your git repo
[05:05] mscdex: :P
[05:05] Nexxy: compared to the endlessly increasing monetary figure for letting someone else do it instead ;3
[05:05] llkazu: lol mscdex 
[05:05] llkazu: bitbucket is free, so meh :-)
[05:06] Aikar: yeah coupled with the fact git is distributed, why do you need backups? :P
[05:06] llkazu: distributed git is only useful for people who are working with a team...
[05:06] llkazu: I'm kind of a one-man shop at the moment
[05:06] mscdex: i never really cared for bitbucket's ui
[05:06] llkazu: well, i work for linden lab, but what I'm doing is my own personal crap
[05:06] Aikar: so, the entire repo is still on your local pc
[05:06] Aikar: if your server goes down, you can restore it back to identical state in minutes
[05:07] Nexxy: is it true that you have to be a furry to work for linden lab?
[05:07] Nexxy: just curious ;3
[05:07] llkazu: nexxy, no ;-) though my avatar is a wookie.
[05:07] Nexxy: hah!
[05:07] mscdex: besides, git is more funner
[05:07] mscdex: :D
[05:07] llkazu: lol
[05:07] Nexxy: ACTION shudders @ mscdex's english
[05:07] mscdex: hehe
[05:07] llkazu: nexxy++
[05:07] v8bot:  llkazu has given a beer to nexxy. nexxy now has 1 beers.
[05:07] mscdex: it was intentional
[05:08] Nexxy: mscdex, do you watch soccer standing up?
[05:08] Nexxy: ;o
[05:08] mscdex: no
[05:08] mscdex: because i don't watch soccer
[05:08] saikat_ has joined the channel
[05:08] mscdex: ;)
[05:08] llkazu: ok, so heroku lets you deploy by pushing code to them. i hear this is the "preferred method."
[05:08] zoro has joined the channel
[05:08] Aikar: if you setup .git/config to do pushUrl = url1; pushUrl = url2, url = url1, can push to 2 repos at once when doing git push (w/o seperate push commands), so i push to my git server and github at same time
[05:08] Nexxy: so you call it "football"?
[05:08] Aikar: which i run a better commit notifier that does diffs on my server
[05:08] mscdex: no?
[05:08] Nexxy: oh ;<
[05:08] llkazu: i want my platform to support svn, hg, and gitâ€¦ so I'm thinking something more along the lines of a commit hook?
[05:08] mscdex: football is football
[05:08] mscdex: soccer is soccer
[05:08] llkazu: what do you guys think?
[05:09] Nexxy: btw I'm accepting applications for node/js mentors if anyone is interested... generous compensation is involved!
[05:09] llkazu: on push, a notification gets sent to the hosting platform that screams "DUDE THERES CODE OVER HERE" and the platform goes and grabs it, doing a deploy.

[05:14] EM03: Not doing any real time chat apps or anything like that right now 
[05:14] EM03: just ruby web dev
[05:15] asdfsafdsa: all apps should be in real time
[05:16] asdfsafdsa: and thats why im using it
[05:16] sivy has joined the channel
[05:16] EM03: hmmm?
[05:16] asdfsafdsa: like any kind of webpage
[05:16] asdfsafdsa: the front page should update in real time
[05:16] yhahn has left the channel
[05:17] asdfsafdsa: the about page, the comments on your blog, everything
[05:17] Nexxy: concurrency is nice for a lot of apps, instead of having to constantly stuff & serialize everything between requests
[05:17] Nexxy: maybe I mean persistence
[05:18] EM03: hmm? still though 
[05:18] EM03: a request to update what should be a static page 
[05:19] EM03: I'm all for updating comments etc
[05:19] mscdex: node has a lot of other uses besides doing realtime stuff, even though it's really good at that
[05:19] EM03: I do mvc style web dev ...rails sinatra etc
[05:19] JianMeng has joined the channel
[05:19] mscdex: EM03: have you looked at some node frameworks, like express ?
[05:19] EM03: I have 
[05:19] Aria: Using node will make your ruby better, too.
[05:19] EM03: nowhere near as sexy as the ruby frameworks hehe 
[05:20] mscdex: there's also geddy
[05:20] EM03: although i see there is a prototype port for node js 
[05:21] mscdex: not sure what other popular frameworks are out there
[05:21] EM03: this could make node more ruby like 
[05:21] mscdex: i have yet to do website stuff
[05:21] mscdex: with node
[05:21] AAA_awright: cloudhead_: What do you mean by partials?

[05:22] zomgbie has joined the channel
[05:22] EM03: partials are sexy 
[05:22] EM03: in rails at least heh
[05:22] Aria: Why make node ruby-like?
[05:22] Aria: Node brings some unique things to the table.
[05:22] EM03: because ruby is sexy 
[05:23] EM03: i loooove my .each 
[05:23] Aria: Sometimes.
[05:23] mscdex: .forEach
[05:23] mscdex: :-D
[05:23] mscdex: although forEach performance sucks
[05:23] SubStack: if you love .each you'll love how javascript has far more consistent scoping rules
[05:23] EM03: I have been a full time web developer since 2002 .....mostly PHP and you know how that is i will have grey hair from that language .....I just would like to live in peace for a few years 
[05:23] stonebranch has joined the channel
[05:24] EM03: well been using ruby since like 03 as well but professionally all PHP until this year 
[05:24] mscdex: the most i've ever used ruby was for several months once and that's it
[05:25] mscdex: and that was purely academic
[05:25] mscdex: heh
[05:25] EM03: ruby is orgasmic 
[05:25] datapimp has joined the channel
[05:25] mscdex: meh
[05:25] EM03: everything works I understand everyhing ....I love smalltalk ...
[05:25] llkazu: meh
[05:25] datapimp has joined the channel
[05:25] Aria: Ruby brings a lot of things to the table. But it's also got a relatively dysfunctional developer community lately. Lots of shifting sands, and a lot of modules that are clever at the expense of stable or debuggable.
[05:25] llkazu: ruby is the bastard child of php, perl, and python.
[05:25] mscdex: ./configure && make smalltalk
[05:25] mscdex: :D
[05:25] EM03: Python was difficult for me as well 
[05:25] datapimp: what is the best way to 'vendor' a package with npm?
[05:25] llkazu: python was difficult?!
[05:25] llkazu: what the heck
[05:25] EM03: not the language
[05:26] EM03: but the stuff made in it 
[05:26] llkazu: o.o like what?
[05:26] EM03: i spent months with zope 
[05:26] llkazu: ugh, nobody uses zope except wannabe java devs.
[05:26] EM03: i barely wrapped my head around the simplest api of it 
[05:26] mscdex: ACTION shakes a fist at python and its required indentation!
[05:26] llkazu: EM03, sane people use django or flask
[05:27] SubStack: there are much better reasons to dislike python I figure
[05:27] EM03: Django is good but much more complex than rails 
[05:27] llkazu: â€¦you're joking, right?
[05:27] EM03: No ...i like conventions 
[05:27] llkazu: and django is full of 'em.
[05:27] EM03: I dont like the whole explicit over implicit 
[05:27] ChrisPartridge: loaded full of em
[05:27] EM03: much much less than ruby 
[05:27] EM03: sorry
[05:27] EM03: rails
[05:27] llkazu: not really, rails lets you go in way too many directions to get the same thing done
[05:27] llkazu: django says "do it this way."
[05:27] EM03: after 1.x django lost a ton of "magic" 
[05:28] llkazu: only in the way things were implemented.
[05:28] llkazu: not in the way you develop
[05:28] EM03: sure there was ....it used to auto load templates based on method name 
[05:28] EM03: sorrry function 
[05:28] llkazu: there's still a shortcut to do that ya know.
[05:28] llkazu: :-p
[05:29] jesusabdullah: Anyone here work on any of the testing frameworks? I particularly have expresso in mind
[05:29] EM03: (( ___ DIR FILE NAME __ ))) (( )) template 
[05:29] EM03: sorry 
[05:29] jesusabdullah: I would like to see an assert.approxEql()
[05:29] llkazu: heh
[05:29] jesusabdullah: ACTION crosses arms
[05:29] EM03: but yea I hate the whole ( __ __ crap in python ...the whole repr() ruby has to_s makes sooo much sense? 
[05:29] EM03: in django most of it is not even in OO
[05:30] llkazu: the wholeâ€¦ what crap? and object orientation is often way overkill for web applications.
[05:30] llkazu: what is ( __ __
[05:30] EM03: in python its harder to know what is a function and whats a method ....even a class definition your like is this a variable binding to a function or? 
[05:30] EM03: a ton of that in python 
[05:30] EM03: I'm not bashing the language but I just love ruby :P 
[05:31] llkazu: a variable binding to a function? you mean class properties?
[05:31] Aria: I had to leave Ruby somewhat after finding a hundred too many one-line methods, and then methods composed of five calls to one-line methods.
[05:31] llkazu: ya, django is full of those, particularly on models...
[05:31] Aria: So many people making it DRY that things are parched
[05:31] llkazu: nice.
[05:31] EM03: ok ruby sucks :P php is great
[05:32] llkazu: ACTION stones you to death
[05:32] Aria: PHP is easy to parse.
[05:32] EM03: but people who try to make python and ruby seem "almost" the same its just not true 
[05:32] Aria: The rest... works.
[05:32] Aria: Mostly.
[05:32] Aria: Kinda.
[05:32] llkazu: php was never meant to be a programming language.
[05:32] llkazu: seriously.
[05:32] llkazu: how a templating language turned into what it is today, ill never understand.
[05:32] jaket: it's easy
[05:32] jaket: that's why
[05:32] EM03: Perl was pretty bad as well 
[05:33] llkazu: how a templating language turned into what it is today, ill never understand!"
[05:33] btipling: expresso wont let me create a redis client in the test
[05:33] ChrisPartridge: jesusabdullah: approxEql for strings?
[05:33] btipling: it just times out
[05:33] llkazu: so the php guys were herped and derped and BOOM php turned into a really bad language only frontend devs ever used. 
[05:33] shaunau: jesusabdullah: here you go: function approxEql(){ return true; }   :)
[05:33] llkazu: then because frontend devs were cheap, everybody hired them to build everything.
[05:33] llkazu: so php became prolific, which meant real engineers started having to know it to get a job
[05:33] EM03: When I frist started programming I always knew PHP sucked ....always 
[05:34] llkazu: which meant real programming techniques got applied to it, around php4 iirc.
[05:34] llkazu: which just fucked with it further.
[05:34] llkazu: and now php5 is around, the original creator hates it, everybody's moved on, and its finally decent.
[05:34] Aria: Now it's finally growed up, in php5.3
[05:34] llkazu: because 3 smart guys got in there and said "screw this crap" and made huge sweeping changes, added decent OO, got rid of a bunch of the redundancy....
[05:34] llkazu: aoisdjfoijasdjf

[05:35] indutny has joined the channel
[05:35] llkazu: sorry, i constantly deal with ancient, poorly-build php apps at work.
[05:35] EM03: I would never use php even with 5.3 
[05:35] llkazu: itsâ€¦ a sore spot.
[05:35] EM03: really?
[05:35] EM03: I would rebuild them just to not use them 
[05:35] llkazu: ya, I'm talking shit that was built in php3, then rebuild for php4, then rebuilt for php5
[05:35] llkazu: I'm actually in charge of rebuilding a vast majority of them.
[05:35] EM03: again I would trash it 
[05:35] llkazu: heh
[05:36] EM03: I don't even install PHP on the web server
[05:36] EM03: just nginx and ruby with passenger
[05:36] llkazu: at the moment i won't do anything but nginx and nodejs for my personal stuff. apache2 and python/wsgi for work.
[05:36] jesusabdullah: shaunau: tssch
[05:37] llkazu: (I'm still using python for a lot of syseng-side stuff, because nodejs just isn't there yet for that)
[05:37] EM03: again I won't hate on Python but I was always opening python files wondering what was going on .....honestly I hated it :( 
[05:37] jesusabdullah: shaunau: I just .foreached over some zipped stuff
[05:37] llkazu: em03, i really think you were looking at the WRONG python crap
[05:37] llkazu: EM03, look at flask.pocoo.org
[05:37] llkazu: micro framework
[05:37] EM03: with Ruby I read it like a book ....it has blocks which I love from smalltalk 
[05:37] llkazu: you'll love it.
[05:37] EM03: I probably will but ....sinatra is the same thing :) 
[05:38] sivy has joined the channel
[05:38] EM03: and Django was ok ....but so much learning I mean so much 
[05:38] EM03: '
[05:38] llkazu: i tried for years to love django. never ended up getting there.
[05:38] EM03: like its al cool ...but I could build this set of features without spending all this time learning and configuring them 
[05:38] EM03: years?
[05:38] llkazu: ya, i've been using it sinceâ€¦ 0.92? i think?
[05:38] EM03: I write around 1,500 lines of ruby a day ...with python it was below 100 :( 
[05:38] llkazu: I've been using python since '99 :-p
[05:40] jesusabdullah: EM03: You're spinning it wrong.
[05:40] EM03: any of you used Drupal ....I had a contract with a guy 7k to do this project .....omg I couldn't do it ...I spent almost a bit over a month .....got 90 [ercent there ....literally 90 jpercent ....and I rewrote it in Ruby in 1.5 days with even more features 
[05:40] EM03: sorry yea :\ 
[05:40] jesusabdullah: Guys, when I worked with ruby I was writing an ungodly 1500 lines a day. THEN I switched to Python and now I only write 100 lines a day!
[05:40] jesusabdullah: *clapclap*
[05:40] jesusabdullah: It's obviously because it's ultra-expressive and terse
[05:40] shaunau: haha
[05:40] EM03: come on ...is it even possible to write bad ruby? :) 
[05:40] jesusabdullah: idk!
[05:41] llkazu: lol jesusabdullah 
[05:41] jesusabdullah: I'm sure it's possible to write bad *anything*
[05:41] EM03: all I know is Python was draining my bank account 
[05:41] llkazu: EM03, its not possible to write GOOD ruby, soo.....
[05:41] jesusabdullah: but I can't comment too intelligently on ruby because, well
[05:41] llkazu: ACTION ducks
[05:41] jesusabdullah: I only really did python
[05:41] jesusabdullah: That choice was mostly due to scipy/numpy I'll have you know!
[05:41] EM03: everything in ruby is an object 
[05:41] EM03: when people in python say that i cringe 
[05:41] llkazu: uh
[05:41] llkazu: everything in python is an object, too
[05:41] llkazu: o.o
[05:41] jesusabdullah: Well, things in python *are* objects, BUT
[05:42] EM03: I know :) say it again and it might be true :) 
[05:42] jesusabdullah: It's inconsistent in terms of how you do things
[05:42] jesusabdullah: len(object)
[05:42] jesusabdullah: er, len(thing)
[05:42] jesusabdullah: wheras you may EXPECT thing.len
[05:42] llkazu: thing.__len__
[05:42] llkazu: :-p
[05:42] jesusabdullah: Well
[05:42] jesusabdullah: You have me there---you *can* do it.
[05:42] EM03: also .....numbers are object but they have any useful functions except some internal meta stuff?

[05:50] jesusabdullah: I like jquery, and for some reason prototype didn't really light my fire

[05:50] jesusabdullah: tbh

[05:51] jesusabdullah: (*usually*)
[05:51] EM03: it makes js more OO than Python 
[05:51] tk has joined the channel
[05:52] jesusabdullah: but js is *already* object-oriented.
[05:52] jesusabdullah: It's just not class-oriented
[05:52] EM03: but naw i want everyone to use jquery :P 
[05:52] jesusabdullah: it's prototype-oriented instead
[05:52] SubStack: I don't like classical OO
[05:52] Casperin has joined the channel
[05:52] jesusabdullah: I don't mind classes sometimes, but they're not really my gig. idk why, but I tend not to miss them when javascripting
[05:52] jesusabdullah: and, I may be wrong, but I feel like that's a lot of what prototype brings to the table
[05:52] SubStack: also I don't think libraries should try to do everything
[05:52] EM03: I like class based .....of course anon functiosn are cool thats why I love ruby it has blocks as well 
[05:53] SubStack: splitting up their scope is a good thing since they can focus on doing one thing well more easily
[05:53] jesusabdullah: Well, and it's also implementation. I mean, MATLAB has anonymous functions, and so does python, but they both suck.
[05:53] SubStack: and if you've got a nice module system you can just stich everything together with it!
[05:53] mscdex: node.js rules!
[05:53] EM03: prototype gives you all the selecotr stuff of jquery ....and an object system where you can do 'adsfasdf'.length in javascript but yet you can't do it in Python heh 
[05:53] SubStack: fact
[05:54] tim_smart has joined the channel
[05:54] antimatter__: mscdex... when memory is random access node.js is pretty much useless
[05:54] jesusabdullah: Maybe that's why it didn't resonate with me. I tend to not like javascript libraries that aim to give you the "missing standard library"
[05:54] mscdex: antimatter__: eh?
[05:54] EM03: well thats what direction jquery is going in 
[05:54] antimatter__: u see random access mem is thing of future
[05:54] EM03: but its ok .....like I said its the PHP for the browser ....copy and paste your code form this or that site ....with prototype you have to build it ....imagine that 
[05:55] mscdex: wasshu talkin bout willis?
[05:55] jesusabdullah: I haven't used jquery that way.
[05:55] EM03: tons of people do 
[05:55] EM03: making hacky jquery scripts 
[05:55] EM03: I let my gf look at my code ....if she says something looks ugly I fix it 
[05:56] jesusabdullah: In php's case, and likely jquery's as well, it's not the library that does it so much as a community that doesn't trap noobs
[05:56] jesusabdullah: If you don't catch the noobs early and either make them learn what they're doing or look elsewhere, they run a good chance of copy-pasting regardless of the library
[05:57] mscdex: jeez, the gf even has reins over your code?!
[05:57] mscdex: :P

[05:57] shaunau: whooped!
[05:57] jesusabdullah: I would not have let my ex tell me what to do re: code
[05:57] EM03: its good to get an outside opinion 
[05:57] jesusabdullah: We also disagreed a lot on what kind of tech was interesting and good.
[05:58] jesusabdullah: She really liked thinking about things on a register level
[05:58] jesusabdullah: like microcontrollers
[05:58] jesusabdullah: flipping bits and shit
[05:58] SubStack: solved problem
[05:58] jesusabdullah: So if I ever talked about "abstractions"
[05:58] mscdex: she was a bit twiddler?
[05:58] jesusabdullah: Somewhat
[05:58] jesusabdullah: aspiring
[05:58] mscdex: heh
[05:58] SubStack: jesusabdullah: it's a pernicious EE disease
[05:58] EM03: I have decided to do everything in Ruby and the only thing that will have a chance is node.js for some real time stuff :P ......I don't work full time now ....I close 2-3 contracts a month and I only get paid with performance .....not just carrying on getting by

[06:00] jesusabdullah: lol
[06:00] mscdex: :-D
[06:00] jesusabdullah: I tried to describe LabVIEW to her
[06:00] SubStack: ACTION has run the gammit of problem component complexity
[06:00] mscdex: hah
[06:00] jesusabdullah: because it has stuff in common with, umm
[06:00] SubStack: abstractions are such a very good thing
[06:00] jesusabdullah: you know, those wire diagram things
[06:00] jesusabdullah: showing gates and stuff
[06:00] EM03: anything like markaby in python? :) 
[06:00] jesusabdullah: I forget what those diagrams are called
[06:00] EM03: it would be damn near impossible to do 
[06:00] jesusabdullah: but then I told her that it was like that, but with while loops, and
[06:00] jesusabdullah: well
[06:00] jesusabdullah: she just couldn't take i9t
[06:01] jesusabdullah: Like, not even that it offended her sensibilities---I think she actually couldn't wrap her head around the idea
[06:01] mscdex: i wouldn't either if whiles  kept blocking my event loop
[06:01] jesusabdullah: AND didn't really want to because it didn't sound legit
[06:01] jesusabdullah: She may have had a point. ;)
[06:01] jesusabdullah: Speaking of labVIEW, I started on the last lab of the semester tonight
[06:02] mscdex: labnode!
[06:02] SubStack: I couldn't wrap my head around vhdl
[06:02] mscdex: jsview
[06:02] SubStack: strangely the rest of the class could
[06:02] jesusabdullah: 6 thermocouples, two flow meters, a watts reading and some fucked up strain gage deal
[06:02] jesusabdullah: It's gonna be nuts
[06:02] jesusabdullah: SubStack: Yeah, EE students eat that shit up. Like I said, they visualize everything in terms of big ol' switches
[06:03] jesusabdullah: I imagine them like high-voltage connects
[06:03] jesusabdullah: like, old-school electric chair levers
[06:03] jesusabdullah: *whoomp*KSSSH
[06:03] jesusabdullah: *whoomp*KSSSH
[06:03] mscdex: i think i used labview to read speed sensors placed around a miniature roller coaster track
[06:03] jesusabdullah: OH SHIT HERE COMES AN AND

[06:05] jesusabdullah: Oh, and also LabVIEW, which is a graphical programming language used for measurements and instrumentation
[06:05] jesusabdullah: Easily understandable for scientists because it's like programming with legos
[06:05] jesusabdullah: in fact, lego mindstorms stuff is all based on LabVIEW
[06:05] jesusabdullah: BUT, it's very limiting when it comes to those abstractions!

[08:12] zilch: framlin, In Summary section, there is a line "The file defining our functions acts as a namespace. Methods and values we provide users of our module must bed exported."

[08:59] phluffy: hey there, all - I'm using the node-mysql-native module and have 2 update statements in my script - problem is that they are happening at different times, but now() is giving me the same time - anyone ever experience anything likt that? 
[08:59] aurynn: phluffy, it's an artifact of being in a transaction
[08:59] JacobSingh: Is it standard MO in express to define app as GLOBALS.app ?  Seems kludgy...
[09:00] zilch: JacobSingh, levu:  include(); is not that complex to understand
[09:00] aurynn: phluffy, there should be something like current_time instead of now(), that returns the current wall time instead of now()-at-start-of-transaction

[09:00] JacobSingh: zilch: well, I get what a require does... I just try to avoid global var.  I assumed there was some other pattern or a singleton or something I should be using to get at "app"
[09:01] phluffy: aurynn: I tried sysdate() but got the same effect - is there any way to remove transactions or is that just buit in to that module
[09:01] phluffy: ?

[09:01] nephics has joined the channel
[09:01] jacobolus: JacobSingh: if you define "app" as a variable in your module scope, what stops you from "getting at it"?

[09:02] JacobSingh: I'm basing my code on https://github.com/visionmedia/express/tree/master/examples/route-separation (but he never access configuration variables in that example)

[09:02] jacobolus: in that example?
[09:03] JacobSingh: ah okay... jacobolus I think I'm getting closer
[09:03] aurynn: phluffy, you want transactions :) But, there should be a way to get the wall time
[09:03] jacobolus: JacobSingh: as far as I can tell it just uses exports, but there aren't any global variables I see
[09:03] coreb has joined the channel
[09:04] JacobSingh: jacobolus: yep that did it... I guess I don't understand the whole "exports" thing yet
[09:04] JacobSingh: seems weird to define methods w/o using a real name for them
[09:05] JacobSingh: I'll have to read more about them I think
[09:05] jacobolus: what do you mean?
[09:05] JacobSingh: jacobolus: zilch : Thanks so much for your help
[09:05] phluffy: just tested "current_timestamp" too to no avail - in PDO I remember having to do something with a "cursor"... guess I will keep a looking - thx aurynn!
[09:05] jacobolus: JacobSingh: exports is an object to which you can attach stuff
[09:05] bzinger has joined the channel
[09:05] jacobolus: then when you require that module, you get its exports object
[09:05] zilch: JacobSingh, you can should use methods with name and not make it anon, helps in debugging !!!
[09:05] zilch: JacobSingh, np
[09:05] JacobSingh: jacobolus: but it's somehow "magic" right? because it's loaded in the module scope
[09:06] zilch: JacobSingh, you needn't worry how export works to use it in your app
[09:06] JacobSingh: jacobolus: as opposed to most languages where you have Module mymod and then mymod::className and then className.method
[09:06] jacobolus: JacobSingh: it's "magic", but it's the "CommonJS" "standard" magic
[09:06] JacobSingh: ala python, ruby, java, etc (in some form or the other)
[09:06] jacobolus: JacobSingh: not sure that's "most languages"
[09:06] sendark: hi could somebody describe what this error from node.js + socket.io might mean? http://pastebin.com/QtRSPki2
[09:07] jacobolus: JacobSingh: in python for example, you also import a module under whatever name you want
[09:07] jacobolus: and it's just a namespace
[09:07] jacobolus: it's somewhat similar to the node case
[09:07] jacobolus: though python has nicer syntax for it
[09:07] JacobSingh: jacobolus: yes that's true... I suppose the confusion for me was not the filename being used as a namespace object but the "exports" object
[09:07] zilch: JacobSingh, jacobolus : http://jherdman.github.com/2010-04-05/understanding-nodejs-require.html may help a bit

[09:08] zilch: JacobSingh, yup !!
[09:08] jacobolus: JacobSingh: sort of, but I wouldn't really say it that way
[09:08] JacobSingh: hah, got to the part "Where Youâ€™re Probably Making Your Mistake (and I Did Too)"
[09:09] jesusabdullah: I didn't know that this was aliased to exports!

[09:10] jetienne has joined the channel
[09:10] JacobSingh: jacobolus: you mean monkey patching?
[09:10] JacobSingh: :)
[09:10] jacobolus: it makes it impossible to immediately tell where code is coming from
[09:11] jesusabdullah: I also did not know about the global scope action
[09:11] jacobolus: JacobSingh: no, I mean importing modules putting all manner of arbitrary stuff in global scope
[09:11] JacobSingh: jacobolus: that's what I call monkey patching
[09:11] JacobSingh: jacobolus: basically stepping in and redefining shit along the way
[09:11] jesusabdullah: I call monkey patching adding methods to stuff already in the global scope
[09:12] jacobolus: monkey patching is taking someone else's code and poking around inside of it
[09:12] jesusabdullah: but then again I'm not from a world where monkey patching is common
[09:12] jacobolus: just importing more things into global scope is something different
[09:12] JacobSingh: jacobolus: oh sorry I read you wrong
[09:13] brianloveswords has joined the channel
[09:13] JacobSingh: jacobolus: (all though, in a way that is kinda the same thing), the global scope is still scope :)
[09:13] JacobSingh: yeah, that part of ruby sucks
[09:13] zilch: BTW, http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/ is linking to the home page nodejs.org. Hope site admin knows it
[09:13] JacobSingh: it's not really ruby's fault
[09:13] JacobSingh: it just allows people to do evil things to eachother
[09:13] jacobolus: coffeescript makes using require rather nicer
[09:14] Poetro has joined the channel
[09:14] jacobolus: because you can use syntax like {foo, bar, baz} = some_module to bring all of foo, bar, baz into the local scope

[09:25] JacobSingh: zilch: I found this site to be helpful nodetuts.com

[09:26] zilch: JacobSingh, thanks ... checking it
[09:26] V1: sendark: hmzzz I don't look so Socket.IO ish to me
[09:26] zilch: JacobSingh, rather than putting a blog post please try to put things on express.js website
[09:26] V1: sendark: what exactly are you doing
[09:26] sendark: ok its because it mentions Client._onConnect
[09:26] zilch: JacobSingh, that way I can be sure that I am having things which are official
[09:26] sendark: i thought it had to do with socket.io. So you think it's node?
[09:28] V1: sendark: yeh, but after that line it says net.js:599:18
[09:28] V1: which points to the net module, from nodejs
[09:28] V1: you are probablly making a connection to some endpoint,
[09:28] sendark: yep
[09:28] V1: without adding .on('timeout') handler
[09:29] sendark: ok
[09:29] sendark: that'd be on the request or on the response?
[09:29] V1: that's why the error is thrown
[09:29] V1: request

[12:22] jtrudeau: i guess this will work
[12:22] V1: you see that cluster.exception depends on "email" and "jade"

[12:41] shaunau_: eldios: word
[12:41] Aikar: Gm1999: from experience, dont work with cygwin, just install a real os. its quicker to install ubuntu in a vm and get node running than it is to get node in cygwin
[12:42] shaunau_: lol
[12:42] Aikar: but ideally you can dev alot easier if you install ubuntu as your primary OS
[12:42] augustl: I just ran "curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh" as per http://npmjs.org/ instructions. Node can't find modules I install, though. Do I still need to set NODE_PATH?
[12:42] Aikar: protip: gaming and coding dont mix!
[12:43] augustl: the installer script and http://npmjs.org/ doesn't mention it at all
[12:43] Aikar: augustl: cause you didnt sudo the sh
[12:43] Aikar: or you need to install the rc instead
[12:44] augustl: I just did what http://npmjs.org/ said :)
[12:44] shaunau_: my irc client makes perrty sounds sometimes and i have no idea why..
[12:44] Aikar: yeah and it doesnt tell you theright thing sadly
[12:44] augustl: perhaps the site isn't up to date?
[12:44] Aikar: you need to sudo the sh to install npm globally
[12:44] augustl: that's a shame
[12:44] augustl: Aikar: I don't mind having it for my user only
[12:44] Aikar: well did you configure node to also be local only?
[12:44] augustl: what does that mean?
[12:44] Aikar: ie add --prefix=~/local to configure, setup ~/bin to PATH
[12:45] Aikar: did you install node with sudo?
[12:45] augustl: no
[12:45] Aikar: type which node
[12:45] augustl: node is installed in ~/.homebrew
[12:45] Aikar: where is it installed
[12:45] febits has joined the channel
[12:45] Aikar: oh mac crap, dunno how to help you lol
[12:45] augustl: so I have to install _node_ a specific way to make NPM work?
[12:45] Aikar: wherever you install node is where npm installs modules
[12:45] augustl: I see
[12:46] Aikar: afk time for work
[12:46] demastrie has joined the channel
[12:46] augustl: npm install says it finds node in "/Users/augustl/.homebrew/Cellar/node/0.4.6"
[12:46] xastey: https://gist.github.com/579814 use the first one augustl
[12:46] augustl: isn't npm maintained anymore since npmjs.org is out of date?
[12:46] xastey: does what everyone has been saying.. add a prefix
[12:47] eldios: you ba$tard$.. I just can't stop listening "I'm on a boat" :(
[12:47] edude03 has joined the channel
[12:47] xastey: wtf is that..
[12:47] augustl: xastey: so I should install node in local?
[12:47] augustl: is npm hardcoded to look for $HOME/local?
[12:47] xastey: nop
[12:47] xastey: whatever your set in your env
[12:47] augustl: set what in my env?
[12:48] augustl: do I have to set an env variable?
[12:49] augustl: neither http://npmjs.org/ or https://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/README.md mentions any env var
[12:49] xastey: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation
[12:49] xastey: pick one.. be happy
[12:50] jano has joined the channel
[12:50] augustl: so my problem is my node installation?
[12:50] xastey: i just came in.. dont even know your error
[12:50] augustl: that node doesn't find modules installed by npm
[12:51] xastey: then I would say yes
[12:51] xastey: juse use that first command you can prefix it anywere you like
[12:51] augustl: I already have node installed. I don't see how installing it in another directory would change anything.
[12:51] xastey: but just use that one
[12:51] augustl: both npm and node is owned by the same user, the one i'm logged in as
[12:52] xastey: like I said you can install it anywere you want
[12:52] sunblush has joined the channel
[12:52] augustl: yep
[12:52] xastey: just use that command
[12:52] augustl: which command?
[12:52] xastey: https://gist.github.com/579814
[12:52] xastey: first one
[12:52] xastey: well script my fault
[12:52] xastey: remove the --prefix if you like
[12:53] augustl: I doubt nobody installs node using the homebrew package manager because NPM won't work with it :S
[12:54] augustl: I suppose I have to set NODE_PATH manually
[12:54] augustl: strange that neither http://npmjs.org/ or the NPM readme mentions this though

[14:49] mscdex: although, if your cpu has hyperthreading or similar too, you can do `export JOBS=8`, like on my core i7-860

[14:50] mscdex: cat /proc/cpuinfo
[14:50] mscdex: or check via node :P

[15:01] pHcF has joined the channel
[15:01] mikegerwitz: slaskis: JOBS=8 is definately faster, but the rest of your machine can't do much if it's tied up with compiling ;) Try JOBS=6 or 7 if you want a core or two available for other stuff
[15:02] tfe_ has joined the channel
[15:02] slaskis: mikegerwitz: yeah, i guess it's wrestling those cycles from other processes because i'm over 10 minutes of compiling now...
[15:02] Lorentz: I'm also on 2.6.38.3, it has that 200 line cgroup patch, I rarely get my laptop slowing down.
[15:03] Lorentz: Even if I do anything intensive.
[15:03] mikegerwitz: slaskis: Well that doesn't sound right. Are you positive you have 8 cores? If you specify too many in JOBS it'll just make things worse
[15:03] Lorentz: cgroup, tty, can't remember exactly what it did
[15:03] slaskis: mikegerwitz: well that's what os.cpus().length reported

[15:53] tjholowaychuk: what's happening?
[15:53] wink_: windows supposedly allows binding to any address and if you set SO_BROADCAST you receive the broadcasts on that interface even if you're not bound to 0.0.0.0
[15:54] wink_: the bsds require 0.0.0.0, and using a different recv call, you can check the headers and figure out which interface got the broadcast

[17:36] patrick99e99: Hi everyone.. I am interested in implementing a file upload with node in my rails app, and I am following along this artilce: http://www.componentix.com/blog/13
[17:37] patrick99e99: But I am curious, how is the best way to tell rails when the file is saved to actually attach it to the model?
[17:37] patrick99e99: how do I communicate with rails from within node?
[17:39] steveklabnik: patrick99e99: if i was you, i'd try to design my system so that they were separate components. or possibly share a database between the two apps.
[17:40] trotter has joined the channel
[17:40] captain_morgan has joined the channel
[17:41] deedubs: patrick99e99: or have your node app post some information into rails after the upload is complete
[17:41] patrick99e99: so it could be like my application jQuery code calls node to upload..  And then node returns success to the jQuery stuff, and then jQuery does an ajax request to rails?  
[17:42] steveklabnik: ACTION nods
[17:42] V1 has joined the channel
[17:43] patrick99e99: and as far as my application js file calling node.....  How does that work exactly?

[17:44] deedubs: patrick99e99: It'll throw an error

[17:50] patrick99e99: so, do I just do another ajax request with whatever port the node server is listening for? deedubs
[17:51] V1: tjholowaychuk: Ah I missed that, I thought it was just as leaky as the repl plugin for cluster :p
[17:51] tjholowaychuk: V1: use the repl with a local socket
[17:51] tjholowaychuk: not leaky at all
[17:51] deedubs: patrick99e99: have node handle the upload and then it can post the result to a underlying rails api
[17:52] V1: tjholowaychuk: You know that, I know that but 80% of the users probably wont know that :p
[17:52] tjholowaychuk: meh
[17:52] tjholowaychuk: not my issue
[17:52] tjholowaychuk: if they do dumb things, they will have dumb results
[17:53] V1: :D
[17:53] patrick99e99: deedubs, but in order to actually do the upload..  say I have a webpage with a multipart form..  and say that form has the id of "foo"...  So when I click upload, it should---  send an ajax request to the port that node is listening on?  And pass in the id of the form element?  or... what?  I am just not quite sure how to get started.
[17:53] tjholowaychuk: it's not as bad as our IRC bot
[17:53] tjholowaychuk: haha

[18:19] jmar777: i think the answer is no, but is there anyway in node.js to use bitwise operators and not pay the float -> int -> float tax? seems like that would require a language extension, or shuttling data back and forth between c-land, but wanted to be sure.

[18:40] doki_pen: and I can send from a web client using socket.io no problem
[18:41] ckknight: no-gooder: what you want to do is not call res.end() where you are, but right after your res.write()
[18:41] ryah: no-gooder: the res.end() needs to be inside the innermost callback
[18:41] ckknight: no-gooder: since what you're doing is saying: "hey, go fetch some data and then immediately return before I get the result from that", what you should be saying is: "hey get me some data, once that's done, write it out and then mark it as ended"
[18:42] no-gooder: ckknight,  ryah , i really understand the problem but can't implement it. i don't kow how to use "callbacks".
[18:43] ckknight: okay
[18:43] stagas: no-gooder: also, you need to rename the conn.query 'res' variable to something else because it's shadowing the http res object
[18:43] ckknight: oh damn, stagas is right.
[18:43] no-gooder: stagas, oh yess. thanks
[18:43] ckknight: no-gooder: rename the inner one "result" and the outer one "response"

[19:12] jesusabdullah: cellvia: Did you have questions about dnode? I may be able to help with a few, having used it previously

[19:13] cellvia: jesusadbullah:  well main question is if you see much use for redis for pub/sub if ive already got dnode going,   any benefits to this as it seems redundant to me?  only thing i can think of is redis will dump the data to disk if i want it to
[19:14] prettyrobots: Okay. I see the test requests. Great.
[19:14] jesusabdullah: Hmm
[19:14] prettyrobots: piscisaureus: I'm planning on doing black box tests, FYI.

[19:15] aguynamedben has joined the channel
[19:15] ckknight: black box testing?
[19:15] prettyrobots: Or Integrationalist, I guess.
[19:16] steveklabnik: ckknight: it's when you dont test internals, just external interfaces
[19:16] ckknight: oh
[19:16] steveklabnik: hence, 'a black box'
[19:16] ckknight: that's how I do it
[19:16] piscisaureus: The tests are there to verify both platform implementations yield the same results.
[19:16] ckknight: I think testing internals can be strange, because it shouldn't matter to the outside API
[19:16] steveklabnik: integration tests are the right way to do it. ;)
[19:16] prettyrobots: Instead of testing a function by calling it directly from the test, you invoke it from the API.
[19:16] piscisaureus: Making unit tests makes no sense here
[19:16] cellvia: yeah, dont know much about redis either... but seems like that would be the main feature
[19:16] steveklabnik: at least, they're the best. sometimes unit tests are good too.
[19:16] Draggor: Unit tests are cool during development.  After? Not so much
[19:16] prettyrobots: Which means you have to sometimes create a strange environment to hit the branch.
[19:16] systemfault: Are your guys TDD fans?
[19:17] steveklabnik: systemfault: yes. bdd, but same thing.
[19:17] steveklabnik: i have yet to really do it with js yet though.
[19:17] prettyrobots: systemfault: Not really.
[19:17] systemfault: steveklabnik: I heard that BDD was the good way of doing TDD
[19:17] jesusabdullah: cellvia: This is how SubStack has done pubsub with dnode in general: http://substack.net/posts/9bac3e/Roll-your-own-PubSub-with-DNode
[19:17] steveklabnik: systemfault: yeah, basically.
[19:17] ckknight: systemfault: sometimes I write tests first, sometimes I write code first. In the end, things will get tested.
[19:17] piscisaureus: Having tests is unavoidable
[19:17] piscisaureus: Much to my regret
[19:18] prettyrobots: systemfault: Oh, if you mean write tests first, no. I can't think that way.
[19:18] jesusabdullah: cellvia: If it looks like something you're interested in, go for it!
[19:18] systemfault: ckknight: TDD people would say that you write code first "code" is untestable or something
[19:18] piscisaureus: If I lived on an island I would invent Test-Free Development
[19:18] jesusabdullah: I write tests to make sure I don't break anything
[19:18] prettyrobots: Some things are testable. Other things I just fix bugs as they occur.
[19:18] systemfault: Ah, thanks all :)
[19:18] steveklabnik: systemfault: ckknight that's not entirely true.
[19:18] jesusabdullah: sometimes I write the test first
[19:18] ckknight: steveklabnik: how so?
[19:18] jesusabdullah: if I'm thinking about API or something
[19:19] cellvia: jesusabdullah: thanks! will check article out
[19:19] jesusabdullah: idk what these "styles" are called
[19:19] steveklabnik: ckknight: it's not a maxim. it's advice. "When you write the tests first, it's generally easier to write testable code."
[19:19] jesusabdullah: cellvia: Yeah, it's a pretty useful one
[19:19] mikeal has joined the channel
[19:19] steveklabnik: nobody would claim that it's IMPOSSIBLE to test code after you write it.
[19:19] jesusabdullah: I do that all the time XD
[19:19] prettyrobots: jesusabdullah: Yeah, actually, a test bench is good place to screw around with example API code, but these days, I try writing the API documentation first instead.
[19:19] jesusabdullah: Actually, what's *really* silly
[19:19] steveklabnik: i do find it significantly easier to get tests done first. i never get around to writing them otherwise.
[19:19] prettyrobots: That's where you find API problems, describing the API in natural language.
[19:20] jesusabdullah: is that I end up testing it in the repl, and then rewriting that ad-hoc test as an expresso test
[19:20] prettyrobots: Hmm...
[19:20] jesusabdullah: PRETTY SILLY
[19:20] jesusabdullah: Hmm
[19:20] jesusabdullah: Not a bad idea prettyrobots 
[19:20] steveklabnik: yep. go from the language first. write the readme first, write some integration tests, write some unit tests, write some code, write another integration test, repeat

[19:21] systemfault: Because I'm a node.js beginner trying to write a small "framework" for my personal blog.. was still wondering if I should use BDD/TDD

[19:29] tjholowaychuk: systemfault: connect is just an abstraction layer
[19:29] jesusabdullah: It's just a middleware kinda thing
[19:29] tjholowaychuk: but it exists to support express
[19:29] jesusabdullah: You make stacks of function(req,resp) 's
[19:29] perezd: cloudhead_: yt?
[19:29] tjholowaychuk: most of express was moved to connect / adjusted over time

[19:35] jesusabdullah: ckknight: Good luck! Something I'd like to see is a generalization of synchronized game state. It's something that my NKO team ran up against making node-chess
[19:35] tjholowaychuk: stagas: it's caught me a few times too haha, but I'm pretty sure most people dont want to be loading user data etc for a favicon
[19:35] tjholowaychuk: stagas: there is a whitelist that connect ignores

[19:35] ckknight: :P
[19:35] jesusabdullah: Yeah
[19:36] jesusabdullah: and of course, for all those games there should be a sort of generalized pattern for keeping everything organized right?
[19:36] stagas: tjholowaychuk: why so? it didn't happen before, I was doing some session init in a middleware and I noticed a while ago it was returning 500
[19:36] jesusabdullah: I mean, the main difference is just the shape of the board and the description of game state
[19:36] tjholowaychuk: stagas: because it's lame lol why would you want session for /favicon.ico

[19:39] ckknight: jesusabdullah: (a) state that player A knows about, (b) state that player B knows about, (c) state that both players know about

[22:09] jmhnilbog: Didn't get much in the way of answers re: simplest session stores :(
[22:09] tjholowaychuk: simplest?
[22:09] tjholowaychuk: connect-redis
[22:10] jmhnilbog: Yeah, and connect-redis works great ---- except the boss wants to avoid the redis dependency atm
[22:10] tjholowaychuk: nedis

[22:10] MikhX has joined the channel

[22:11] jesusabdullah: You can try pkrumins/node-supermarket
[22:11] jesusabdullah: I've used it before
[22:11] tjholowaychuk: jmhnilbog: sesame has c++ stuff to I believe (proxy?)
[22:11] jesusabdullah: uses sqlite on the back end
[22:11] tjholowaychuk: so why not just have redis
[22:11] tjholowaychuk: super easy to install
[22:11] amerine has joined the channel
[22:11] jmhnilbog: supermarket works on my  devmachine, but install is failing on the deployment box.
[22:11] tjholowaychuk: or swap it out for nedis
[22:11] jesusabdullah: D:
[22:11] SubStack: jmhnilbog: do you have sqlite3-dev?
[22:11] jesusabdullah: Yeah, I remember the install sucking. It's because of the sqlite module, right jmhnilbog ?
[22:11] jmhnilbog: Yep.
[22:12] DoNaLd`: pifantastic: example .. my nodejs file  example.js has definition of function xy .. and i will instance of this function send to the client site .. over expressjs .. and i need use this function in included client .js file of some .ejs definition .. is it better described ?
[22:12] jmhnilbog: I might just push for redis, then.
[22:13] jmhnilbog: Redis is just a lot of horsepower for what I intend to use it for -- nStore would have been the best option if only I could coax it into working.
[22:14] tjholowaychuk: haha
[22:14] c4milo: I have a question about commonjs and nodejs, how does nodejs wrap my modules? 
[22:14] tjholowaychuk: yeah working ... is better than not working
[22:14] tjholowaychuk: redis is insanely small
[22:14] tjholowaychuk: no reason to not use it
[22:14] tjholowaychuk: or if you just want to get away from something you need to manage / compile
[22:14] tjholowaychuk: nedis is kinda like nstore ( i guess )
[22:14] tjholowaychuk: in that it is written with node at least haha
[22:15] c4milo: may I assume that global variables in my module are wrapped using the module pattern, by nodejs? 
[22:15] EyePulp: c4milo: I think it's verboten to say node has anything to do with commonjs, but it does sort of use the module/require aspect
[22:16] jmhnilbog: I mostly wanted to avoid redis b/c: 1) it's another thing to monitor, 2) node is new enough in the organization, and I'd rather force change slowly
[22:16] creationix: c4milo: but, yes, it does wrap local variables
[22:16] c4milo: creationix: nice
[22:16] creationix: even top-level variables, but not true globals
[22:16] jmhnilbog: I'll muddle through with connect-redis, no prob.
[22:16] c4milo: yes I understand 
[22:16] jmhnilbog: Thanks for the input/advice!
[22:17] creationix: things like window.foo or var-less can be protected as well with a special flag

[22:28] patrick99e99: ok thanks...
[22:28] patrick99e99: so brew install is not the ideal way to install npm then?  because I just installed it today.
[22:28] isaacs: patrick99e99: brew update first
[22:28] isaacs: patrick99e99: then `brew install npm` will tell you to not do that

[22:29] patrick99e99: got it..
[22:29] patrick99e99: thanks
[22:31] isaacs: patrick99e99: you should get in the habit of doing `brew update` before installing anything
[22:31] patrick99e99: will do...
[22:31] isaacs: especially fast-moving projects.  brew keeps its registry local, so you must pull to get new versions of stuff
[22:33] patrick99e99: isaacs, do you have any advice on how to learn BDD in javascript?  I have not done any automated testing and I don't quite understand how to effectively do it (especially stubbing/mocking)
[22:33] zilt has left the channel
[22:34] isaacs: patrick99e99: i'm not a big fan of mocking.  i mean, it has its place, but i think it's overused and make-work
[22:34] isaacs: patrick99e99: but for writing tests, imo, nodeunit is one of the best.  expresso has code coverage reports, which is nice.  and vows is a fancy pants rspec type DSL thing
[22:34] isaacs: so it's kinda up to you
[22:35] isaacs: i wrote node-tap, which is fairly nice, but not all that mature yet

[22:35] isaacs: right now, node-tap tests itself
[22:35] isaacs: and that's all :)
[22:35] isaacs: and not very well :)
[22:35] jesusabdullah: XD
[22:36] isaacs: but, its aims are a bit more lofty than just being the tdd framework everybody uses.
[22:36] patrick99e99: i just installed node after brew update, and I am told Please add /usr/local/lib/node to your NODE_PATH environment variable to have node libraries picked up.
[22:36] patrick99e99: how do I do that?
[22:36] isaacs: patrick99e99: add this to your .bashrc or .bash_profile file:  export NODE_PATH=/usr/local/lib/node
[22:36] isaacs: patrick99e99: then `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.bash_profile` to pick up the change
[22:39] jesusabdullah: isaacs: What's the goal then? >:D

[23:01] tjholowaychuk: it's not really a work around

[23:11] ralphholzmann: three 20mb buffers shouldn't kill my 512mb server
[23:11] mscdex: wink_: pong
[23:12] ckknight: blueadept: more competition isn't a bad thing.
[23:12] stagas: 'delete buffer' ensures it's deleted, buffer = null just replaces the reference for 'buffer', but another function may have copied it
[23:12] ckknight: blueadept: nodester does what I need, though.
[23:12] blueadept: was if it provides a good framework, i guess i can fork it and build a sweet front end

[23:14] mikey_p: what's the best place to host node with mongodb right now? I was looking at dotcloud, but their mongo support is still in alpha
[23:14] johnnywengluu: anyone is using mustache on express?
[23:14] johnnywengluu: cant imagine noone =)
[23:14] mscdex: ralphholzmann: do you have something in place to prevent someone from uploading an arbitrarily sized file?
[23:14] duncanbeevers: I've heard DuoStack has good mongo support.
[23:14] ralphholzmann: mscdex: yes
[23:14] steveklabnik: yep
[23:14] mscdex: ralphholzmann: are you using formidable?
[23:15] ralphholzmann: mscdex: no
[23:15] steveklabnik: i still have a duostack invite or two, if anyone's looking to try it
[23:15] mscdex: ralphholzmann: i'm curious as to why not? is it not a web form upload or ?
[23:15] ralphholzmann: mscdex: no, its not
[23:16] mscdex: ah ok
[23:16] ralphholzmann: I wrote an incoming SMTP server
[23:16] ralphholzmann: that processes emails
[23:16] stagas: hm actually delete has stopped working on me
[23:16] ralphholzmann: with a max email size of 25mb
[23:16] stagas: wtf
[23:16] mikey_p: duncanbeevers: thanks
[23:16] mscdex: ralphholzmann: so you've seen Haraka?
[23:17] ralphholzmann: mscdex: yes, but I have a _very_ specific use case
[23:17] ckknight: oh, stagas, `delete variable;` is actually a misnomer and shouldn't work.
[23:17] mscdex: ah
[23:17] ckknight: ralphholzmann: do thing = null;
[23:17] ralphholzmann: ckknight: okay, thanks! will try
[23:17] a|i: how can nginx find out which requests belong to dnode?
[23:18] a|i: (if having nginx in front of node)
[23:19] mscdex: even null takes up space
[23:19] mscdex: :P

[23:19] duncanbeevers: I'm not a big fan of all these libraries that hand back url parameters as a js-object whose keys represent the param names. http://www.example.com?foo=bar&foo=baz is a fully-valid url that I should be able to pull both foo values out of.
[23:19] mscdex: duncanbeevers: good libraries will parse that and have the value be an array
[23:20] mscdex: foo[0] = 'bar' and foo[1] = 'baz'
[23:20] mscdex: imho
[23:20] stagas: ckknight: yeah it seems you can't delete vars declared with var, only properties. and you're right only the reference is deleted, the obj still stays in mem if copied
[23:20] ckknight: stagas: as well it should be :P
[23:21] ckknight: if a reference to a deleted object was hanging around somewhere, that totally destroys a VM's type safety mechanism

[23:23] a|i: NuckingFuts: using dnonde, nowjs, or homemade?
[23:23] NuckingFuts: a|i: Hand-made
[23:23] NuckingFuts: Though the web pages for it are using ExpressJS
[23:24] NuckingFuts: With Jade for the templating
[23:24] NuckingFuts: Or wiat
[23:24] NuckingFuts: Not jade... what was it I used?
[23:24] a|i: NuckingFuts: any plans to use revese proxy in front of it?
[23:24] a|i: not sure if it's possible to reverse proxy socketio by nginx.

[23:40] zakabird: hi all! has anybody done anything where javascript can be edited/run/debugged on the client, or know of projects to look at? I'm finding debugging the entered code to be a hassle - and am wondering how cloud9 (for example) does it..
[23:40] wadey: Jckf: I've heard good things about https://github.com/rmustacc/node-ctype
[23:40] wadey: but I haven't tried it yet myself

[23:43] tbranyen: I really do not understand whats going on in this issue
[23:43] tbranyen: what javascript idiom is this guy talking about
[23:43] Jckf: wadey: That seems even better =) I only need read read and write longs
[23:43] zakabird: i think to debug they run the code on node/server not the client. seems js eval is really limited on the client
[23:44] ntelford has joined the channel
[23:44] NuckingFuts: zakabird: What?  JS is client-side traditionally :/
[23:45] NuckingFuts: It's just that NodeJS takes it to the server
[23:45] tlrobinson has joined the channel
[23:45] secoif: zakabird: what do you mean client side
[23:45] secoif: you mean in the browser
[23:45] NuckingFuts: I'm pretty sure Cloud9 is client-side debugged :V
[23:45] secoif:  do you mean debugging your server side code remotely?
[23:46] ckknight: zakabird: actually, I have a repl in a node.js app that allows me to eval code on the server.
[23:46] duncanbeevers: Well, I know the ACE hooked up to Akshell runs your code remotely, not in the browser.
[23:46] newy has joined the channel
[23:46] zakabird: yea I mean on the browser
[23:46] secoif: you mean like
[23:46] shiawuen has joined the channel
[23:47] secoif: your normal browser code
[23:47] secoif: like
[23:47] duncanbeevers: But the ACE component is pretty general-purpose. There's no reason you couldn't run its contents client-side.
[23:47] secoif: jquery stuff?
[23:47] zakabird: ckknight: is it on github?
[23:47] secoif: or you mean your nodejs code?
[23:47] ckknight: zakabird: no, but I can paste the code, hang on

[23:48] secoif: zakabird:  http://code.google.com/p/chromedevtools/wiki/EclipseDebugger
[23:49] secoif: sorry, http://code.google.com/p/chromedevtools/wiki/EclipseDebugger
[23:49] secoif: oh ffs. copy paste fail.
[23:49] secoif: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/using-eclipse-as-node-applications-debugger
[23:50] zakabird: secoif: well I want a repl(ish) thing where you can enter code (test things out rapidly for example, build an app 'live in the browser' etc) but im finding debugging to be broken - i.e. the browser debugger doesn't seem to know how to debug the entered code
[23:50] ckknight: zakabird: sorry, I don't have the code here. The fundamental idea though is to have a <form> on your page, submit it to a URL, take the textual input out of one of the fields, run eval() on it.
[23:50] ckknight: and that eval would take place server-side, not client-side
[23:50] skm has joined the channel
[23:50] ckknight: and the server would return some result to you
[23:50] zakabird: hmm.. thanks secoif, I'll look at that link
[23:52] zakabird: ckknight: doing it like that too. but eval on client. are you able to debug inside that code ok? i.e. could you set a breakpoint in the entered code? does the user get a clean linenumber etc if theres a syntax error?
[23:52] ckknight: zakabird: nah, not really.

[23:54] zakabird: thought i was making great progress - but its a hassle to not even get line number on error and a stacktrace that only leads up to the eval call! (i.e. a useless stacktrace)
[23:56] duncanbeevers: zakabird: Have you considered sucking the content out of your textarea or whatever and just injecting it into a <script> tag?
