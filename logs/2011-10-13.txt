[00:00] CrabDude: shesek: fair amount of experience mucking around in V8's D8 protocol and debugger, etc...
[00:00] enki: AvianFlu: well, yeah, it might either run out of memory or unstuck after a really long time ;)
[00:00] enki: but i'd say it's still broken buffering behavior
[00:00] OneOfOne: enki: you try with 0.5.9?
[00:00] shesek: CrabDude, well, hmm, I'm not sure what's simpler than typing console.log() in the console and not seeing anything
[00:00] AvianFlu: if you don't have 0.5.9 installed, enki, I can test it in a second
[00:00] enki: nope, this is 0.4.12
[00:00] enki: don't have 0.5
[00:01] shesek: CrabDude, maybe its worth mentioning I'm on 0.5.8? any chance it doesn't work there?
[00:01] AvianFlu: doesn't happen in 0.5.9 for m
[00:01] AvianFlu: me
[00:01] CrabDude: shesek: is console.log only failing when inspector is on? what about when --debug is on, but inspector is not?
[00:01] AvianFlu: but I'm 95% sure stdout is blocking in 0.5.9, so that would make a ton of sense
[00:01] CrabDude: shesek: negative, that's what I'm running
[00:02] AvianFlu: oh wait! it's hanging after outputting 1 on 0.5.9
[00:02] AvianFlu: how lulzy

[00:02] enki: stdio is hard, let's go shopping

[00:03] shesek: CrabDude, shesek@shesek:/tmp$ echo 'console.log(123456);' > test.js || shesek@shesek:/tmp$ node --debug test.js || debugger listening on port 5858123456
[00:04] Brandon_R: I have a question
[00:05] CrabDude: shesek: well, first, you won't be able to debug that b/c it'll finish running before you have a chance to hit it in inspector
[00:05] Brandon_R: Why do we write bindings in C++ and not C if node.js is written in c
[00:05] shesek: yeah, I know, just wanted to check if console.log() works at all
[00:05] CrabDude: shesek: 2nd, if executing a file with ONLY console.log('XXX') in it doesn't log "XXX", you have bigger problems than inspector
[00:05] CrabDude: ah, ic
[00:06] shesek: but... with debug-brk and continuing from node-inspector it does show up
[00:06] shesek: most be a problem somehow related to my code
[00:06] OneOfOne: Brandon_R: who told you it's written in C?
[00:06] CrabDude: try hitting something like: var i=0; setInterval(function(){debugger; console.log(++i);},1000);
[00:06] CrabDude: see if that logs
[00:06] CrabDude: see if it breaks when you open in inspector
[00:06] OneOfOne: Brandon_R: v8 is written in C++, nodejs is written in C++ as well, take a look at https://github.com/joyent/node/tree/master/src
[00:07] Brandon_R: i thought cc was c extention and cpp was c++'s?
[00:07] sechrist: does node have any kind of object merge in the stdlib?
[00:07] OneOfOne: Brandon_R: no, .cc/.cpp = c++, .c = c
[00:07] CrabDude: sechrist: underscore.extend?
[00:07] Brandon_R: cool
[00:07] Brandon_R: learn something new everyday
[00:08] CrabDude: sechrist: util.inherits
[00:08] sechrist: does it only work with instances of a function or does that matter?
[00:09] OneOfOne: Brandon_R: when in doubt, open the source file and look, can easily tell the difference between c/ c++
[00:09] Brandon_R: will do
[00:09] shesek: CrabDude, I tried something simpler - `console.log(123456);debugger;` in test.js, than `node --debug-brk test.js`, than opening up node-inspector and hitting play so it'll stop on the `debugger` statement. The 123456 does show up in the terminal, but not in node-inspector
[00:10] CrabDude: util.inherits(A, B) === A.prototype = B.__proto__ === A = Object.create(B.__proto__); (i think that's right)
[00:10] shesek: which is also weird, because console.log() didn't show up in the terminal either in my actual code

[00:34] SubStack: chilts: he's in australia righ now being a hobo
[00:34] chilts: heh
[00:34] CrabDude: since inspector jsut consumes the D8 protocol that node's V8 puts out
[00:34] SubStack: he stayed in my empty room in oakland for a month
[00:34] CrabDude: so it might not even be an error in node, but possibly even V8
[00:35] CrabDude: shesek: hopefully it's just inspector though. I'd still file an issue and he'll at least know where to look.
[00:35] CrabDude: shesek: I'm out, but good luck

[00:57] Brandon_R: hi
[00:57] sechrist: for newer ones
[00:57] SubStack: chef doesn't work well for our stack because our services span multiple servers
[00:57] SubStack: and people can be connected to the servers when we push out an update
[00:58] SubStack: and we don't want to kill those connections
[00:58] SubStack: so I'm writing stagecoach using bouncy to make it so that you can do zero-downtime deploys through some routing-table trickery
[00:59] tjholowaychuk: just going to redirect traffic?
[00:59] slickplaid: that sounds fun

[01:30] illumina: or I'm totally missing something
[01:31] tjholowaychuk: i have some thoughts on how to do that "correctly"
[01:31] tjholowaychuk: but nothing complete yet :p
[01:31] sechrist: what you want a package.json for each page and loading only the package the page needs?
[01:31] SubStack: socket.io doesn't work in browserify because it's too clever and already has its own non-browser mode shimming that confuses browserify
[01:31] illumina: no - in particular I'm doing some game development. so I actually have only one HTML page that's a canvas
[01:31] SubStack: if you just write your code the node way then it browserifies fine
[01:32] illumina: but my code (javascript) is complex. I want to break it up into multiple files so multiple people can work together.. express dependencies as objects, etc. (you know the drill)
[01:32] SubStack: just throw your dependencies into a package.json
[01:32] SubStack: let npm figure that out
[01:32] illumina: SubStack: browserify seems to work great, except with socket. which is sort of the point of what I'm doing

[03:41] dthompso99: query for anyone good with c++ addons, i cant seem to find a good example of this...
[03:42] dthompso99: I have an addon... once i require it, i call a "new"  xxxx
[03:42] dthompso99: from that new xxx, i'd like to expose some methods to js
[03:43] dthompso99: but i cant find the "target" to use for the templates
[03:43] dthompso99: that probably made no sense.... 
[03:44] Aria: No, it does. It's a bit tricky.
[03:44] Aria: It's kinda backward feeling inside. You have to wrap and unwrap the objects you want from JS wrappers.
[03:44] brianc: dthompso99: are you making the add-on? can you show your code?
[03:44] Aria: Or set it up in the initialize method. You usually end up with TWO methods for each function. One static, that unwraps the real object and calls the method, and then the real method.
[03:45] Aria: You register the first, not the second.
[03:45] dthompso99: yes, i can show... i'll pastebin it ina  sec
[03:45] smus has joined the channel
[03:46] dthompso99: http://pastebin.com/rm7h2dGv
[03:48] dthompso99: Aria: so option 1 is to put the target in the wrapper of the "new" method... and unwrap it somewhere on the other side?
[03:48] Aria: Yes, possibly. I'm looking at your code to get a less abstract idea.
[03:48] Aria: What sort of methods are you having trouble exposing?
[03:49] dthompso99: for the child objects, they need to have a read / write method
[03:50] Aria: (And which is the child?)
[03:50] Aria: Oh, the things created by new?
[03:50] dthompso99: NewCm15a / NewCM11a
[03:50] dthompso99: right
[03:50] Aria: Okay, so you're wrapping in an X10. Good.
[03:51] neekers: if i have  app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));, where do i put index.html and how to i access it?
[03:51] Aria: neekers: in whatever __dirname + '/public' is, as index.html?
[03:51] neekers: this works but i dont think its right, fs.readFile(__dirname + '/public/index.html',
[03:51] max_dev has joined the channel
[03:52] Aria: Sure, if you want to read it as a file, neekers. But you should be exposing it to the web with static, so you shouldn't need to touch it.
[03:52] neekers: Aria: i'm not sure how to read it otherwise
[03:52] nyrb has joined the channel
[03:52] Aria: neekers: who are you reading it to?
[03:52] baoist has joined the channel
[03:53] Aria: Okay, dthompso99: What I think you want to do is add functions to the PrototypeTemplate of the ConstructorTemplate
[03:53] neekers: app.get('/', function(req, res){
[03:53] Aria: neekers: and? What's trying to access index.html?
[03:53] detaos has left the channel
[03:54] neekers: i'm using readfile and then res.end(data); where data is from the file
[03:54] Aria: dthompso99: So you'd add new FunctionTemplate::New(NewCm15a) sorts of things there.
[03:55] dthompso99: Aria:  any thoughts on an example of that?
[03:55] Aria: neekers: Okay... so why are you using the static middleware?
[03:56] Aria: neekers: Looks like you're trying to not use it there.
[03:56] neekers: when i created a new project with express, that was there, i just assumed i was supposed to used some how to serve static files
[03:56] brianc: dthompso99:  I can get you an example
[03:56] brianc: dthompso99: one moment
[03:56] neekers: Aria: https://gist.github.com/1283332
[03:56] dthompso99: sweet, thanks
[03:56] rektide: getting this error when trying to compile: http://pastebin.com/F8tVTNT2
[03:56] Aria: neekers: Sure. So go to /index.html.
[03:56] brianc: dthompso99: https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/blob/master/src/binding.cc#L67
[03:57] Aria: Oh, right! The NODE_SET_PROTOTYPE_METHOD macro.
[03:57] dthompso99: oooh!  sweet
[03:57] neekers: Aria: i tried fs.readFile(__dirname + '/index.html', but it couldnt find the file
[03:57] dthompso99: i seen that there, but had no idea thats what it did
[03:58] Aria: neekers: No, drop all that. Just to go to http://yourserver/index.html -- it'll read the file to you. N
[03:58] dthompso99: how to args get handled with that macro?
[03:59] dthompso99: nm, i see, just in a wrapper
[03:59] Aria: Yep.
[03:59] neekers: Aria: in app.get('/', function(req, res){ here?
[03:59] dshaw_ has joined the channel
[03:59] neekers: go to?
[03:59] Aria: neekers: No, in your browser.  Just try it.
[03:59] Aria: neekers: you're expecting to have to write code. You don't.
[04:00] Aria: The middleware you use, the express.static bit -- that serves files in public/. For you.
[04:00] Aria: No intervention required.
[04:00] Aria: URL = filename.
[04:00] Aria: No magic, really. It's a dumb static file server.
[04:00] brianc: it will help you avoid accidentally serving files from other places on your file system though
[04:01] neekers: ahh, i see
[04:01] brianc: so if someone requests http://yourserver/../../../var/log/auth.log it doesn't send them that file
[04:02] Aria: rektide: I just built node with python 2.7, as far as I can tell. All working.

[04:04] marcello3d: need a different version of connect/express to use 0.5.9...
[04:05] marcello3d: possible to install via npm or do I need to build from sauce?
[04:05] mbrevoort has joined the channel
[04:05] brianc: mmmm…sauce.
[04:05] brianc: i like that
[04:06] Tprice: it says "jsdom": "~0.2.7"
[04:07] neekers: Aria: i had some conditional things that need to happen based on whether the query string had certain parameters. if so i would do one thing and if not, i would serve up index.html. i assume that i cant serve up static files using express.static if i need to use my logic?
[04:07] Tprice: i havean older version of zombie but its trowing other error
[04:07] brianc has left the channel
[04:07] Aria: So that's ~any 0.2.x, Tprice. Try installing another version, a point lower or so.
[04:07] Aria: Just as a guess.
[04:07] Aria: neekers: That's not exactly static, then ;-)
[04:07] rektide: Aria: hrm, thanks for the report. i've had to re-symlinkpython to 2.6 will see what happens next
[04:08] Aria: neekers: So yeah, you have to do the serving yourself, or make middleware that lives above the static handler that tweaks the request as it goes by.
[04:08] neekers: ahah
[04:08] Aria: rektide: make sure you delete the pyc files, of course.
[04:08] neekers: Aria: node is opening up a whole new world to me, i need to start thinking a little differently...

[13:08] Sembiance: Raul_: seems like your DNS maybe isn't set up quite right :)

[13:09] TheJH: Raul_, try moving the 8.8.8.8 nameserver on top (networkmanager will reset this after the next reconnect)
[13:09] Sembiance: Raul_: well, the 8.8.8.8 entry is Google's DNS server, but the first one is a local IP address. It sounds like it's porbably having issues. Move that line to the bottom
[13:09] TheJH: Raul_, then try the nslookup again

[13:12] TheJH: Raul_, when you restart networking or reconnect or so, it'll undo your changes
[13:12] mikedeboer has joined the channel
[13:12] TheJH: Raul_, if this works, you'll have to change some other configuration to make it permanent
[13:12] Raul_: Ouch!
[13:12] Raul_: Oh ohk
[13:12] Raul_: really?
[13:12] TheJH: Raul_, I think you can tell it to ignore the network-supplied DNS in the network options GUI or so
[13:12] Raul_: So for now i just try shifting that line to the top
[13:13] Raul_: and nslookup?
[13:13] TheJH: Raul_, yes, try nslookup after you changed resolv.conf
[13:14] Raul_: for the sake of completeness, i am behind a uni proxy

[13:19] TheJH: Raul_, the two proxy options should be sufficient
[13:20] TheJH: Raul_, at least if https works normally
[13:20] TheJH: errm, I mean, at least if the https proxy behaves normally
[13:20] Raul_: Anyway of checking that?
[13:20] Raul_: the https i mean
[13:21] Raul_: btw Sorry,  i dont quite follow "two proxy options"
[13:21] aamir-m: Just wanted to know... How does node.js manages multiple website on same server on port 80?
[13:21] tjholowaychuk: aamir-m there's an abstraction in libuv for fd passing
[13:21] TheJH: Raul_, with two proxy options, I meant hroxy and https-proxy
[13:22] TheJH: aamir-m, what do you mean with that?
[13:23] aamir-m: TheJH: If I want to host multiple domains on IP 123.123.123.123 using node.js, how would I do that and how does node manages it?
[13:23] aamir-m: TheJH: multiple domains on the same port: 80
[13:23] TheJH: aamir-m, there are some modules for that which do reverse proxying
[13:23] tjholowaychuk: aamir-m with 0.4.x you would use http://learnboost.github.com/cluster/ or similar

[15:49] broofa has joined the channel
[15:50] PEM: mmalecki is it working now ? you might need clearing your cache ?
[15:50] SubStack: Shekhu: you can use something like passenger to proxy the node app on a virtual host
[15:50] fennec: node behind apache would make some sense in and of itself; not sure what you'd do with node + PHP though
[15:51] SubStack: Shekhu: or you can throw a balancer in front of apache and node to do the host routing

[15:54] isaacs: TheJH_phone: yes, here.
[15:54] mmalecki: PEM: probably my cache, it's Chrome dev, so things fail to work sometimes
[15:54] PEM: ah ok
[15:54] fennec: shekhu - you want to make RPC calls to node from PHP code? it'd work, but i'm not sure exactly why you'd want to do that :)

[15:54] SubStack: mmalecki: I would work on it more but I have a new product to launch right now
[15:55] Aikar: why would you use drupal
[15:55] TheJH_phone: isaacs, when you use npm with a proxy, who resolves the name? Npm or proxy?
[15:55] mmalecki: SubStack: browserling?
[15:55] isaacs: resolves which name?  the name for registry.npmjs.org?
[15:55] isaacs: TheJH_phone: the proxy's dns would be responsible for that.

[15:56] Shekhu: lol Aikar I think Drupal is a good CMS. :)
[15:56] isaacs: TheJH_phone: when you make a request, you say:   HTTP/1.1 GET http://registry.npmjs.org/foo\r\nHost: my.proxy.com
[15:56] mmalecki: when using SOCKS5 proxy you can choose where to resolve the address
[15:56] isaacs: mmalecki: pcap that noise, man.  you give the proxy the name, not the ip
[15:57] jarek has joined the channel
[15:57] isaacs: mmalecki: SOCKS5 is not a basic HTTP proxy
[15:57] isaacs: it's a more involved dance, which npm does not do.

[16:25] isaacs: Raul_: i think the /etc/hosts thing had nothing to do with it
[16:25] KaL has joined the channel
[16:25] isaacs: it's just that your proxy can't handle registry.npmjs.org's CA cert
[16:25] isaacs: or can't make https requests, maybe, i dunno
[16:26] Raul_: is there any way of checking out the latter?
[16:26] Raul_: and yeah i used the http registry
[16:26] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: ah, OK, thanks :)
[16:26] andrewfff has joined the channel
[16:26] isaacs: Raul_: not being familiar with your http proxy, i have no idea.
[16:26] Carter has joined the channel
[16:26] isaacs: Raul_: but maybe you need to give it an https url to your proxy, rather than http?
[16:26] isaacs: Raul_: some proxies are stubborn about not serving you unencrypted data from a https request

[16:31] isaacs: Raul_: npm config set loglevel <level>
[16:31] isaacs: the levels are silent, error, warn, info, verbose, silly
[16:31] isaacs: warn is the default
[16:32] isaacs: info is reasonable.  verbose is noisy.  silly is absurd.
[16:32] Raul_: :) ty
[16:32] Raul_: True to their names..
[16:32] isaacs: silent never prints anything to stderr, but will still print normal things to stdout.
[16:33] isaacs: like, if you do `npm ls -s`, it'll still print the list of pkgs
[16:33] Raul_: Ah i see
[16:33] isaacs: -s = --loglevel silent, --verbose = loglevel verbose, -d = loglevel info, -dd verbose -ddd silly

To my knowledge you can't generate new code for dart at runtime, so Either they massively inefficiently run the simple case, or HelloWorld actually uses much of that code. *Maybe* it's just their packager that hasn't matured yet. Either way it's a fun stat.

[18:45] tbranyen: you still have time! book a flight
[18:45] octalmage: haha, I don't think so.
[18:45] octalmage: idk, I tried this:http://blog.nowjs.com/get-started-with-nodejs-for-002-and-two-minut
[18:45] octalmage: because I use ec2, but no luck

[18:46] octalmage: It says it comes preinstalled with nowjs, but it says it can't find now.
[18:46] octalmage: (the example does)
[18:46] octalmage: What would y'all say is the best way to get started? on your local host?
[18:47] Shekhu: I have an application that requires curl request to a URL and get the data which I want to display in real time. It also needs to do user management(registered and uregistered users) and payment gateways as well. I was planning to use Drupal as backend and node to do rest of the stuff. Is this a good approach. Can anyone comment on it?
[18:48] Venom_X: octalmage, yes, install locally. For ec2 I use the ubuntu-nodejs AMI. It come pre-installed with node, and works great for me. BTW, I'm in Austin, too.

[19:33] TheJH: octalmage, use dnode :D
[19:34] TheJH: octalmage, it works better when the webpage is on the same server and port as the RPC library
[19:34] TheJH: octalmage, but it also works cross-domain and cross-port

[19:48] MacDiva has joined the channel
[19:48] TheJH_L: whse_: you can get a view of the used part with .slice()
[19:48] whse_: I have that in place, but because the protocol I am working in can contain binary information, that becomes an issue
[19:48] TheJH_L: whse_: why does it become an issue? it shouldn't.
[19:49] whse_: message could be as small as 300B or as big as say.. 600K
[19:49] magnetik_ has joined the channel
[19:49] whse_: per-connection allocation of 600KB would be a bit overboard

[19:50] whse_: Thats what I was thinking as an option to handle it

[19:51] TheJH_L: whse_: huh? a workaround?

[20:38] jamescarr_: is there  a specific logger I should use to have logging messages like the ones that socket.io uses?
[20:39] `3rdEden: jamescarr_ we build our own custom logger for socket.io
[20:39] tjholowaychuk: jamescarr_ https://github.com/visionmedia/log.js is similar
[20:40] mmalecki has joined the channel
[20:40] jamescarr_: thanks... you dudes should extract the custom socket.io logger out altogether ;)
[20:41] hotch has joined the channel
[20:41] tjholowaychuk: i'd like to add some more stuff to the sio logger
[20:41] tjholowaychuk: for larger messages
[20:41] `3rdEden: and timestamps
[20:41] `3rdEden: :)
[20:41] tjholowaychuk: gets a bit insane at times haha, truncating them would be nice
[20:41] tjholowaychuk: not by default i guess, because that could be annoying
[20:42] jamescarr_: btw, maybe a RTFM type question, but how can I tone the log level down in sio?
[20:42] tjholowaychuk: personally i think it should default to being disabled
[20:42] `3rdEden: we could just add log level silly tjholowaychuk for stuff like that :)
[20:42] TomY has joined the channel
[20:42] tjholowaychuk: `3rdEden for huge messages?

[20:43] versicolor has joined the channel
[20:43] c4milo: tjholowaychuk: yeah it looks like if I don't close the socket connection in the client properly, that even doesn't get fired 
[20:43] `3rdEden: that is true, but a half data uri isn't help full either
[20:43] tjholowaychuk: we could just do "foobarba<...500 bytes>"
[20:43] tjholowaychuk: c4milo it should timeout
[20:43] tjholowaychuk: after a while
[20:43] c4milo: tjholowaychuk: is there any way to modified the socket timeout value? 
[20:43] c4milo: to modify* 
[20:43] tjholowaychuk: it's hardcoded in http.js or something i think
[20:43] jamescarr_: it'd be nice if the logger had some common interface so I could just log to airbrake
[20:44] tjholowaychuk: you could probably just set it again
[20:44] c4milo: tjholowaychuk: I'll look into that then, thanks man

[20:53] wink_:  russ: they're expected to, but not by magic afaik
[20:53] TheJH: russfrank, only filesystem accesses use the thread pool, I think

[20:53] baudehlo: when I do vm.runInNewContext() and pass a require in the sandbox, how can I tell that require the correct path to look in? Do I have to make a new require somehow?
[20:53] wink_: erm
[20:53] c4milo: that
[20:53] mjr_: c4milo: that's what we use, and it usually works, except if the server is https, then it merely OFTEN works.
[20:54] TheJH: baudehlo, curious. what are you using the sandbox for?
[20:54] c4milo: mjr_: gotcha, what site is it?

[20:56] mjr_: I have not, but I've been meaning to look at that
[20:56] mjr_: We use the default of 2 minutes.
[20:57] russfrank: wink_: so you can write it to not use the thread pool if you were nuts?  once it goes out to the pool, how do you get a callback back to js/
[20:58] baudehlo: TheJH: I use it to load Haraka plugins, and add boilerplate code to the top of them - logging and constants and stuff.
[20:58] cconstantine has joined the channel
[20:59] baudehlo: TheJH: but when they do require('../../blah') it isn't in the directory people think it should be, because I'm passing in the require that belongs to the core library.
[21:01] baudehlo: if I look in core's module.js _compile() it creates a require() per module... I guess that's the only way.

[21:15] TheJH: elliottcable, why? run it once, write down which tests fail, re-run them ten times to make sure you got the more probable race conditions, write them down, too, and now you can already start coding. not that hard :P

[21:19] TheJH: CrisO, no, maybe there's a race condition in the applications code
[21:19] elliottcable: that makes it hard on the rest of us trying to use the test suite, makes the test suite less useful overall

[21:21] elliottcable: but you shouldn’t have to do so under Normal Circumstances.

[22:29] Matheus28: yes

[22:29] lukstr: Matheus28: what's it written in
[22:30] Matheus28: oh wait
[22:30] dreamdust: Show us
[22:30] tjholowaychuk: moar coffee
[22:30] Matheus28: It's written in javascript, the compiler uses node.js
[22:30] MooGoo: cat file.js > file.js
[22:30] MooGoo: my compiler
[22:30] joshkehn: I'll pass on any something-to-js compiler
[22:30] Matheus28: not like coffe, it's more readable...
[22:30] tjholowaychuk: MooGoo woah that's nice
[22:30] ryanolds_w: I love the cat compiler.
[22:30] tjholowaychuk: im going to use that
[22:30] MooGoo: yea cats make the best compilers
[22:30] tjholowaychuk: from now on
[22:30] tjholowaychuk: fuck js
[22:30] ryanolds_w: It compiles stuff from my disk to my screen.
[22:30] joshkehn: something-to-js compiler written in js?
[22:30] joshkehn: Why wouldn't you write it in the lang that compiles to js?
[22:30] lukstr: joshkehn: he has to port it, obviously :)
[22:31] tjholowaychuk: write it in CS
[22:31] Dmitrijus: MooGoo: this will just destroy file.js!
[22:31] tjholowaychuk: so you need CS to compile your lang
[22:31] joshkehn: Lol
[22:31] Matheus28: It's really based on javascript, but it adds some cool stuff, like "for(i in 0...array.length){}", "delay(1000){alert('Hello, world');}", "arr.map(function(x) => x * x);", etc
[22:31] joshkehn: What is cool about that?
[22:31] joshkehn: I see nothing “cool” about that
[22:31] lukstr: what I would like to see is someone write a nicer language than js

[22:32] mmalecki: Matheus28: well, link?
[22:32] Matheus28: I'm also working on another programming language, which is statically compiled, and compiles to javascript

[22:33] joshkehn: People are to focused on the language.
[22:33] joshkehn: Stop focusing on the language.

[22:33] joshkehn: They aren't compilers

[22:34] kenperkins: pulls from redis, enqueues using node mailer, and voila
[22:34] Matheus28: @joshkehn Would you consider something that compiles to AVM2 bytecode a compiler?

[22:39] mmalecki: RICH.
[22:39] jesusabdullah: mmalecki: Once I get a computer that can run minecraft I might set up a server
[22:39] lukstr: Matheus28: I think the game right now is to pick a browser you find supports the standard features you want, then abstract what you need into libraries that can be swapped out to fill in support for other browsers at a later date. no point wasting time writing super compliant code :/
[22:40] Brandon_R: nic
[22:40] Brandon_R: e
[22:40] Brandon_R: when will c++ style games come into the browser
[22:40] mmalecki: jesusabdullah: I can set up a server

[22:41] mmalecki: Matheus28: html5
[22:41] lukstr: AvianFlu: re: minecraft?
[22:41] AvianFlu: yeah
[22:41] AvianFlu: anything in particular?
[22:41] lukstr: specs are all inverse
[22:41] Brandon_R: minecraft is programmed in java?
[22:41] Brandon_R: nice
[22:41] Xeoncross has joined the channel
[22:41] lukstr: RAM is low
[22:41] russfrank: needs about 2gb of ram to run well
[22:41] cafesofie: it's java all the way down
[22:41] Matheus28: Brandon_R: Welcome to 2011, enjoy your stay
[22:41] AvianFlu: yeah minecraft is a beast like that
[22:41] lukstr: hard disk isn't huge
[22:42] Brandon_R: what would minecraft be like if it's programmed in c
[22:42] Xeoncross has left the channel
[22:42] Matheus28: Fast?
[22:42] AvianFlu: less ram
[22:42] russfrank: not shitty?
[22:42] Matheus28: lol
[22:42] schwab has joined the channel
[22:42] russfrank: its such a good concept
[22:42] lukstr: you can squeeze it into as little ram as you want
[22:42] russfrank: so horribly, horribly implemented
[22:42] lukstr: if you tell the jvm to gc like mad
[22:42] AvianFlu: sooooooo biiiiiig
[22:42] Matheus28: russfrank: I don't think so
[22:42] mmalecki: actually, choosing good java vm options is half of a win here
[22:42] jesusabdullah: lukstr: The SERVER needs 2 gigs to run healthy? Christ
[22:42] russfrank: yes
[22:42] russfrank: the server
[22:42] jesusabdullah: Fuck that then
[22:42] jesusabdullah: My linode has like 512
[22:42] Matheus28: Minecraft is good, but using java for it was a mistake, it uses WAY too much RAM
[22:42] jesusabdullah: Mb
[22:43] elliottcable: 60 S 945 84 < Brandon_R> what would minecraft be like if it's programmed in c
[22:43] elliottcable: 60 S 945 95 < russfrank> not shitty?
[22:43] elliottcable: I lol’d
[22:43] Lorentz: Minecraft? More like needs 4GB
[22:43] lukstr: jesusabdullah: I have a dedicated 1GB machine at around 1.5 ghz and it can run 2 players pretty good
[22:43] russfrank: haha
[22:43] jesusabdullah: man
[22:43] AvianFlu: my 512 ran two players okay
[22:43] mmalecki: jesusabdullah: mine one was using 1 GB, I think
[22:43] jesusabdullah: I know the client is a fucking beast
[22:43] mmalecki: and yeah, 2 players as well
[22:43] jesusabdullah: but I assumed the server would be pretty well-behaved :(
[22:43] fread2281 has joined the channel
[22:43] russfrank: dude the client has worse graphics than doom and it runs like ass if you don't have a decent machine
[22:43] lukstr: jesusabdullah: the server essentially is just a headless client
[22:43] elliottcable: in Java? lolnah
[22:43] Matheus28: It's requires around 128 MB per player... that sucks
[22:43] Lorentz: I was trying to push 4, 5 players on a 512 linode
[22:43] mmalecki: jesusabdullah: there's a Python server
[22:43] lukstr: jesusabdullah: so all the world data is in ram
[22:43] Matheus28: it*
[22:43] Lorentz: It wasn't a good idea
[22:44] Brandon_R: i have never played minecraft before
[22:44] mmalecki: jesusabdullah: it takes < 200 MB
[22:44] Brandon_R: how many players can be in a room
[22:44] AvianFlu: I was about to say it can't be impossible to make a minecraft server in something else
[22:44] jesusabdullah: world data in ram might actually be a good idea
[22:44] mmalecki: but it can't do TNT
[22:44] russfrank: : |

[22:44] tiagobutzke has joined the channel
[22:44] jesusabdullah: so you can get it totally so fast
[22:44] lukstr: the other problem is he uses, I believe, dirty JVM networking so
[22:44] ryanolds_w: Matheus28: Needs more then that. I ran a 20 lots server for a while and needed over 2gb to support 10 people.
[22:44] lukstr: it's not easily portable
[22:44] Matheus28: Brandon_R: A lot, but most pcs won't support it
[22:44] mmalecki: well, my friend and I decided to fill 8x8x8 chunk with TNT and blow this shit up

[22:45] elliottcable: lukstr › TCP makes you cry?
[22:45] Brandon_R: udp is better for games
[22:45] lukstr: for GAMES
[22:45] lukstr: it is retarded
[22:45] russfrank: hahah
[22:45] elliottcable: well yeah
[22:45] lukstr: essentially

[22:45] lukstr: the world replays
[22:45] elliottcable: sorry I forgot the topic was minecraft

[22:45] lukstr: all of the changes
[22:45] lukstr: rather than just
[22:45] lukstr: updating
[22:45] Brandon_R: it's not about being a fan
[22:45] jesusabdullah: Yeah elliottcable you be quiet
[22:45] lukstr: so if you lag out for, say
[22:45] lukstr: 10 seconds
[22:45] AvianFlu: lukstr, yes, good case for UDP
[22:45] Brandon_R: its about choosing the right techonolgy for the project
[22:45] elliottcable: jesusabdullah › no u
[22:45] kenperkins: hey jesusabdullah what's new
[22:45] Matheus28: I like how we went from a discussion about my programming language to minecraft...
[22:45] jesusabdullah: n2mu?
[22:45] lukstr: Brandon_R: yes, right tool
[22:45] russfrank: hahah
[22:45] elliottcable: Matheus28 › your programming language?
[22:46] elliottcable: Matheus28 › → #elliottcable if you would
[22:46] ryanolds_w: Need a new version of godwin's law, but about minecraft.
[22:46] lukstr: the whole minecraft server thing makes me cry
[22:46] Matheus28: elliottcable: what?

[22:47] jesusabdullah: etc, etc
[22:47] mmalecki: jesusabdullah: http://www.bravoserver.org/
[22:47] russfrank: theres a bunch apparently
[22:47] russfrank: http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Custom_servers
[22:47] jesusabdullah: mmalecki: Have you heard of bukkit? It's an extension library
[22:47] russfrank: i was unaware
[22:47] lukstr: jesusabdullah: I stopped listning at "node.js"
[22:47] mmalecki: jesusabdullah: I did, but I didn't use it
[22:48] lukstr: russfrank: I think those are mostly out of date -- he's been updating too quickly.
[22:48] elliottcable: the friends I have who subscribe to this minecraft insanity swear by bukkit
[22:48] jesusabdullah: lukstr: Then what happened?
[22:48] mmalecki: also, here's gh repo https://github.com/MostAwesomeDude/bravo
[22:48] lukstr: after the game officially comes out
[22:48] elliottcable: one of my friends even wrote a bukkit plugin that versions the entire world with git
[22:48] lukstr: he said he'd open source it to modding community if you sign a license
[22:48] jesusabdullah: That sounds handy
[22:48] elliottcable: so you can commit changes and publish the world history on GitHub
[22:48] lukstr: so a re-written server is possible
[22:48] kenperkins: jesus: you minecraft too?
[22:48] kenperkins: damnit
[22:48] lukstr: and I look forward to participating in it :P
[22:48] kenperkins: I can't spend more time in that fucking game
[22:48] jesusabdullah: kenperkins: Used to, don't have the hardware for it right now
[22:48] mmalecki: elliottcable: I did that!
[22:49] mmalecki: without publishing part
[22:49] jesusabdullah: but it's in the mail!
[22:49] kenperkins: gotcha
[22:49] mmalecki: and by hand
[22:49] ryanolds_w: git commit -m "Removed dirt block"
[22:49] kenperkins: what do you mean by hardware? for a server or client
[22:49] jesusabdullah: Don't worry, I only play casually, but it's a fun game!
[22:49] ryanolds_w: git commit -m "Placed dirt block"
[22:49] jesusabdullah: kenperkins: My laptop is way too underpowered
[22:49] jesusabdullah: Oh man, imagine the feed on THAT git repo

[23:47] Croms has joined the channel
[23:47] elliottcable: well, it’s good that you’re not *that* guy, instead.
[23:48] elliottcable: then I would become bothered by the fact that you seem to be talking through *this* guy.
[23:48] vidi has joined the channel
[23:48] mmalecki: yeah, this guy done some terrible things
[23:48] bnoordhuis: elliottcable: my spider sense tells me you're not following node on github
[23:49] jesusabdullah: hahaha
[23:49] mosen: I guess from the topic that 0.6 is incoming? :)
[23:49] kab3wm has joined the channel
[23:49] jesusabdullah: I follow projects but I follow enough of them that I don't actually find my feed useful anymore
[23:49] jesusabdullah: same with people
[23:49] elliottcable: bnoordhuis › I don’t pay attention to my GitHub stream.
[23:50] elliottcable: bnoordhuis › I follow, er, over 1,000 projects, and nearly 1,000 people.
[23:50] elliottcable: https://github.com/elliottcable

[23:50] elliottcable: ah, no, I was wrong
[23:50] elliottcable: “Following 496 coders and watching 1,015 repositories”
[23:51] ctide: hy
[23:51] ctide: why
[23:51] elliottcable: ctide › I was one of the first GitHub users, and I followed everyone/everything I found interested. It got out of hand when GitHub got popular.
[23:51] ctide: i see
[23:52] elliottcable: and now I cba to go back through and unfollow/unfavourite things I don’t actually care about. I really just use it as a bookmark list, of repos to re-visit later.
[23:52] ctide: yeah, that makes sense
[23:52] elliottcable: maybe when GitHub has an iPhone and OS X client pair, that actually *push* notifications to me, I’ll start caring about the state of my followship.
[23:52] mmalecki: I do the same, sadly
[23:52] elliottcable: ACTION shrugs
[23:52] elliottcable: bnoordhuis › nice to meet you, in any case ^‿^
[23:52] elliottcable: bnoordhuis › which sections are your area of expertise, if you’re contributing a lot?
[23:52] bnoordhuis: elliottcable: likewise
[23:52] bnoordhuis: elliottcable: everything really
[23:52] elliottcable: oh?
[23:53] elliottcable: might want your input here in a bit, then.
[23:53] elliottcable: I’m replacing Script-stuff with code to actually use a prototype to get things into and out of the subenvironment.
[23:53] Kunda has joined the channel
[23:53] elliottcable: it has some downsides though, that I’ll be wanting to discuss A) the necessity of caring about, and B) how to mitigate (if anyone cares.)
[23:54] elliottcable: bnoordhuis › just watch for a pullrequest from me, and comment :3
[23:54] mosen: damn there are a lot of modules using require.paths.unshift() :)
[23:54] joshkehn: mosen: Unfortunately. 
[23:54] bnoordhuis: elliottcable: i always do
[23:54] bnoordhuis: usually "not interested, closing" >:)
[23:54] bnoordhuis: i kid, i kid
[23:55] elliottcable: lolol
[23:55] mosen: joshkehn, yeah, im hoping the authors get around to patching, my dependencies are exploding

[23:56] joshkehn: If you have any you really need fixed open an issue
[23:56] joshkehn: Fixing them isn't that difficult most of the time.
[23:56] mmalecki: just pull request.
[23:56] joshkehn: mmalecki: That's if you fix them yourself.
[23:56] mmalecki: it's easy.
[23:56] mosen: It's not hard to fix..
[23:57] mmalecki: joshkehn: yes. it's easy enough.
[23:57] mosen: but doing a pull request for one line might be overkill
[23:57] joshkehn: mosen: Not really
[23:57] elliottcable: not at all
[23:57] elliottcable: that’s the best kind.
[23:57] elliottcable: :D
[23:57] elliottcable: you could always re-write all of the comments in the codebase in Malaysian.
[23:57] elliottcable: that’d make it more than one line.
[23:57] elliottcable: er, hopefully. >,>
[23:58] jesusabdullah: Yeah, I'm not huge on require.paths.unshift and am kinda glad it's become bad practice
[23:58] mmalecki: the best one was a pull request for a semicolon
[23:58] elliottcable: mmalecki › BEST ONE
[23:58] mosen: mmalecki, haha
[23:58] bandola: Hi all  
[23:58] bandola:  I am new to node.js  
[23:58] mosen: here, take my semicolon
[23:58] jesusabdullah: Actually, fixing require.paths.unshift would probably be greatly appreciated
[23:58] elliottcable: a pull request that does nothing except change the mode on a single file.
[23:58] bandola:  do you need to reload the framework or something to get rid of cached files ?
[23:58] elliottcable: zero-line pull request ftw
[23:59] jesusabdullah: "[fix] trailing whitespace"
[23:59] saikat has joined the channel
[23:59] elliottcable: people need to use .gitlabels
[23:59] elliottcable: and quit it with this [fix] and etc
[23:59] elliottcable: )=
[23:59] jesusabdullah: wtf are gitlabels?
[23:59] enmand has joined the channel
[23:59] elliottcable: github.com/elliottcable/.gitlabels
[23:59] jesusabdullah: also we use the [tags] at work so
[23:59] elliottcable: [fix] and friends, on steroids, and specified.
[23:59] jesusabdullah: I really don't need steroids for that
[23:59] elliottcable: lol.
