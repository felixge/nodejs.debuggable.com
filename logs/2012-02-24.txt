[00:02] naderman: hey all, can anyone explain to me how dependencies on git repos work in npm? Is there a way to specify a package from git (e.g. master branch) and to depend on a package which depends on some version, e.g. 1.0.0 of that package but make it use the master branch?

[00:08] Tobsn: yeah looking at that
[00:08] Tobsn: i think i need to use that
[00:08] Tobsn: elbart looks too simple
[00:08] Nuck: He's got some pretty heavy loads he's using it for, and he's generally a good programmer, so I'd trust it
[00:09] Nuck: Well, planning on using it for, at least.  Dunno if he's into production yet
[00:09] jerrysv: there is an issue with 3rdEden's in that if you are using an older sharding algorithm it won't match

[00:46] tuhoojabotti: yes

[00:58] Nuck: Ah
[00:58] tjholowaychuk: ag4ve they're not very different

[00:58] Nuck: Well, I haven't made any native modules yet
[00:59] timoxley: tjholowaychuk agreed. good to have competition though.

[01:01] timoxley: ouch

[01:02] Nuck: Yeah, but I know what fibers tend to do to stack traces

[01:11] Nuck: Oh, does Express have SPDY yet?
[01:12] Eruadan: i don't know both, i'm just checking everything, as i want to do my first project with node.js. I just have a good base ground with javascript, and now i want to start learning the libs

[01:14] thepatrick: having worked with SproutCore, backbone.js is painful in what it doesn't do for you. but really, ember.js is s the better think to compare to backbone.js

[01:21] timoxley: cliffano fork, fix, submit pull request, use your fork until it is fixed in main repo
[01:21] unomi: The problem, as I see it, with mashing together microframeworks, is that there generally seems to be risks of: A. impedance mismatch or other interop friction, B. Generally narrow support and ecosystem, C. Documentation and knowledge transfer within a team

[01:22] timoxley: cliffano also possible they will publish an updated version without the broken
[01:23] cliffano: timoxley: i've done similar approach before.. the main problem is that pull requests often get ignored for weeks... and even then it's not always published right away

[01:27] Tobsn: hmm so weird, i cant find the remote addr
[01:27] unomi: if we, for arguments sake, say that backbone.js is to the client as express is to the server..
[01:28] abraxas has joined the channel
[01:28] unomi: I would say that backbone.js is a microframework, while express is .. not. :p
[01:28] timoxley: it's not a microframework.
[01:29] unomi: I think though that this mostly down to my preference for skinny servers and fat clients
[01:30] unomi: if you compare express to persevere2 though..
[01:30] ningu: hmm, I've never seen backbone.js...
[01:30] ningu: would you normally use jade client-side for something like that?
[01:31] unomi: then express starts to look more like a microframework rather than a comprehensive approach
[01:31] ningu: or some other template language
[01:31] davidbanham: It's not micro, but you can make it pretty light depending on how you use it. One of my applications just uses Express as a REST API provider that gets hit from a single page web app.
[01:31] ningu: and just send templates from the server?
[01:32] unomi: ningu: people do all kinds of different things, personally, yes - I would not be rendering html on the server unless I had to
[01:33] ningu: is performance ever an issue in your experience rendering templates client-side?
[01:33] davidbanham: I think that's the really nice thing about Express, though. You can go all the way from full on server side templating to a minimal REST API in the same tool. Sure, there are probably better options that specialise on one or the other, but you can do it all with Express and only need to learn one framework.
[01:34] unomi: davidbanham: nod, but then from there you need persistance / CRUD / 'stuff'
[01:34] unomi: I agree with you there though

[01:35] jmar777 has joined the channel
[01:36] unomi: Express seems to have achieved a level of non-cruft where it doesn't seem to be innately too heavy for a given situation
[01:36] Wa has joined the channel
[01:36] sorensen__ has joined the channel
[01:36] davidbanham: And as much as middleware may go against node philosphy, I think it's that concept that allows Express to acheive that.
[01:37] davidbanham: There's a bunch of stuff sitting there, if you don't use it it's pretty much invisible, but if you do want it it's right there.
[01:37] unomi: I'll admit though, when I first met Express I was wondering why anyone would build such a thing
[01:39] alejandromg has joined the channel
[01:39] unomi: It struck me as rather old-paradigm, and gave me flashbacks of Rails
[01:40] Nuck: I don't see how middleware isn't Node-like?
[01:40] Nuck: It seems like a very good solution to the problem.
[01:40] davidbanham: Nuck: I think I'm half recalling something I heard on Nodeup recently. Basically that you shouldn't need middleware because all that stuff should be easy enough to just do in node.
[01:40] tjholowaychuk: unomi node isn't exactly new either, concept-wise that is
[01:40] looopy has joined the channel
[01:40] tjholowaychuk: it's just more "available" with javascript
[01:41] tjholowaychuk: davidbanham that would be ideal
[01:41] tjholowaychuk: node just doesn't facilitate it
[01:41] tjholowaychuk: in core
[01:41] tjholowaychuk: moving that concept to the third-party just fragments
[01:41] jmar777 has joined the channel
[01:41] Nuck: I think Middleware is the ideal solution to the problem, I just wish it were standardized more
[01:42] tjholowaychuk: ideally Connect doesn't exist
[01:42] timoxley: tjholowaychuk so hang on, what solution are you suggesting
[01:42] Nuck: I agree, Connect should ideally not exist
[01:42] timoxley: connect gets merged with core?
[01:42] tjholowaychuk: well no
[01:42] tjholowaychuk: but *something* to facilitate modularity better
[01:42] perezd_ has joined the channel
[01:42] tjholowaychuk: what that is who knows
[01:42] tjholowaychuk: nothing is perfect
[01:42] Nuck: I think we need a lightweight middleware system, sorta like EventEmitters
[01:43] davidbanham: We need to balance the desire to keep core as lithe as possible with the desire for abstracting away as much grunt work as possible.
[01:43] unomi: tjholowaychuk: sure, Thin and other evented back-ends have a fairly long history
[01:43] Nuck: In this case, it's not gruntwork avoidance
[01:43] SubStack: davidbanham: grunt work belongs in modules
[01:43] Nuck: It's fragmentation avoidance
[01:44] Nuck: Like, let's face it, EventEmitters are a standard, a lot of modules use them.
[01:44] QaDeS_ has joined the channel
[01:44] Nuck: So we know how to interact with anything like that, automatically
[01:44] SubStack: connect is far from a foregone conclusion about how to organize web apps
[01:44] dekub has joined the channel
[01:44] Nuck: I'm not asking for something like Connect
[01:45] Nuck: Just a VERY basic Middleware system, that makes no assumptions about content
[01:45] unomi: tjholowaychuk: but the point is exactly that it *is* JS based, and so presumably is geared towards people who have worked with JS etc
[01:45] fermion has joined the channel

[01:46] jldbasa has joined the channel
[01:46] Nuck: Hell, all I want is EventEmitters where each binding calls back when done and the arguments for the callback are passed to the next function
[01:47] unomi: I can't presume to know enough about the current approaches to middle-ware to critique it though
[01:47] tmike: events really are fantastic
[01:47] tjholowaychuk: they're all leaky
[01:47] tmike: they shave so much code
[01:47] tjholowaychuk: but that goes with most abstractions
[01:47] Nuck: I know I once implemented the middleware pattern before I'd even seen it or used it or heard of it
[01:48] davidbanham: Yeah, we've moved beyond my level of knowledge on middleware. Agree that events are a wonderful thing.
[01:48] unomi: tmike, indeed, and they also inherently leave reuse / interop options open
[01:48] tmike: yep

[02:45] chjj: like lua, or python, or something
[02:45] tjholowaychuk: lua is a good fit i dont know why they dont go with that

[03:22] unomi: outside of my direct experience, sorry.
[03:22] wingie: what is the most wanted way to handle errors in production .. i guess i shouldn't throw them since that will kill the node.js app
[03:22] tmike: wingie that really depends on the severity of the error, and the source of the error
[03:22] wingie: should i just log the error through services like loggly so the app can still run while I fix the error ASAP?
[03:22] trakowski77: throwing them should not be a problem as long as you catch all they way on the top... and log them there
[03:23] wingie: trakowski77: how can you catch them all in asynched code?
[03:23] trakowski77: Let me try ;)
[03:24] tmike: lol
[03:24] isaacs: wingie: the pattern is to do myObj.emit("error", new Error("bad is happening!")) and then handle that in myObj.on("error", function(er) { log it fix it get out asap })

[03:35] wingie: isaacs: why is that? what is the difference between listening on uncaughtException vs my own error event on an EventEmitter?
[03:35] isaacs: wingie: context.
[03:35] isaacs: wingie: you know what request/response/file/whatever it was related to
[03:36] tmike: wingie: if you received an uncaught exception you're very likely left in a bad state
[03:36] isaacs: wingie: in uncaughtException, all you know is that *something* was thrown from *somewhere*
[03:37] wingie: isaacs: couldn't i do something like: if (err) { err.debug = something; throw err } .. then i would have context
[03:37] isaacs: wingie: right, but not all the context you need to be able to gracefully provide a 500 error to the user, make sure taht all vars get gc'ed, that you haven't left dangling references all over the place, etc.
[03:37] wingie: it's kinda me passing whatever context object to the error event handler manually (globalListener.emit('error' something))
[03:37] abraxas: V8 related, but .. I read somewhere that when using HandleScope, you _must_ do a scope.Close(), yet even in node.js's own code I see countless of cases where this doesn't happen.. Is node doing it wrong, or was the explanation I read wrong?
[03:38] isaacs: wingie: process.uncaughtException is so that you can gracefully restart your service.
[03:38] isaacs: wingie: continuing on there is by definition leaving your stuff in an unknown and probably broken state.
[03:39] wingie: okay then

[03:42] wingie: so have that in mind when making a decision between dojo and yui
[03:42] wingie: yahoo is pretty all in with this :)
[03:42] isaacs: abraxas: if you're not returning anything you don't need to close over anythig.
[03:43] isaacs: abraxas: scope.Close(value) prevents "value" from being gc'ed
[03:43] isaacs: abraxas: i'm probably glossing over all manner of subtlety there.
[03:43] abraxas: isaacs: scope.Close() literally is equivalent to a JS return statement?
[03:43] abraxas: okay
[03:43] isaacs: abraxas: sort of
[03:43] isaacs: abraxas: assume that everything defined in the scope of that HandleScope will be gone with the scope gets destructed
[03:44] abraxas: isaacs: destruction being at the end of my function, right?
[03:44] isaacs: abraxas: right

[03:45] unomi: imo, yui3 strikes a really nice balance between 'easy on the eyes' and well-engineered
[03:45] ag4ve: wingie: though, ya know, how many more years is yahoo really viable - might be like sun and get bought by.....
[03:45] abraxas: isaacs: without realizing it, i've been using the docs on your website all this time :)
[03:45] abraxas: isaacs: except i was inside of the iframe, missing the menu on the left.. i think i have some more study material now :) examples, etc..
[03:46] unomi: it has probably some of the best API docs around, a very broad and coherent ecosystem and approachable core devs
[03:46] hisanori has joined the channel
[03:46] unomi: ag4ve: well, yui3 is BSD open-source, so it is unlikely to offer a rug-pull experience.
[03:47] devaholic has joined the channel
[03:47] unomi: and most, if not all of Y!'s web properties are based on it, as are a number of Canonicals
[03:48] abraxas: isaacs: in some example code, I see an exception not being followed up by a scope.Close() which kinda makes sense to me, but in the node.js c++ addon examples, an exception is always followed by scope.Close(Undefined())
[03:49] Destos has joined the channel
[03:49] wingie: ag4ve: have a look at this: http://www.youtube.com/yuilibrary
[03:49] wingie: yui is more oriented around node.js than dojo i think
[03:50] wingie: they were probably the first who supported node.js
[03:50] cha0s has joined the channel
[03:50] wingie: and they ported almost everything to node.js instead of having it on php, python, java
[03:51] wingie: if you want a low level framework yui could be quite interesting .. if you want something higher i would recommend Sproutcore

[04:32] unomi: wingie: sorry, had a context shift moment back there
[04:32] unomi: when you talk of the 'new sproutcore' are you talking about ember.js or?
[04:32] isaacs: cliffano: 1.0
[04:32] isaacs: cliffano: the curl|sh approach gets the right one
[04:32] isaacs: ircretary: inst cliffano
[04:32] ircretary: cliffano: `curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh` (or, if there are permission issues, you can try: `curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh`)
[04:33] unomi: statechart ( statemachine? ) sounds compelling - what is your take on the YUI3 'MVC' initiative?
[04:33] wingie: unomi: no .. it's called Blossom
[04:34] wingie: EmberJS is another framework also based on SproutCore but has made it more Backbone like
[04:34] cliffano: isaacs: thanks..
[04:34] wingie: unomi: if you love working with HTML and not in ExtJS way you could pick Ember
[04:35] hexTech has joined the channel
[04:35] cliffano: wingie: because my wake-up-timezone is not always the same as isaacs' :) ..
[04:35] wingie: if you love having a JS API to work with and use the same API for mobiles, tablets, desktops and browsers you should pick/wait for Blossom
[04:35] isaacs: cliffano: where do you live?
[04:35] wingie: it'll be in beta in at top 2 weeks i think
[04:36] cliffano: isaacs: AU - GMT +10
[04:36] isaacs: cliffano: yeah, that's pretty much opposite
[04:36] AvianFlu: isaacs, when you said curl|sh before I read it as "churlish"
[04:36] AvianFlu: made for a funny sentence
[04:37] cliffano: isaacs: btw, I'm compiling a list of your descriptions about Australia on NodeUp... hillarious and very well done...
[04:37] isaacs: cliffano: uh oh...
[04:37] wingie: unomi: YUI's MVC it's backbone like .. not in the same leagues as Blossom/ExtJS
[04:37] wingie: it depends on what level you wanna work on .. lower or higher
[04:37] wingie: HTML/CSS or JS
[04:38] cliffano: isaacs: we love it over here... keep 'em coming..  yours and mikeal's are the best
[04:38] isaacs: yeah, we gotta get mikeal on another one
[04:38] isaacs: they flow a lot better when he's there
[04:38] wingie: unomi: i personally prefer the latter after I have worked with Sproutcore and ExtJS
[04:38] cliffano: isaacs: I'll post the list over the weekend :D

[06:57] jesusabdullah: hermanjunge: and .sort uses this return value to sort accordingly.
[06:57] harthur has joined the channel

[09:25] boltR has joined the channel
[09:26] Daegalus: BASE62 = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
[09:26] Daegalus: 1234567890 -> bv8h5u
[09:26] Daegalus: its for shortening
[09:26] torvalamo: 64 is more common
[09:26] benvie: http://140byt.es/keywords/encode
[09:27] Daegalus: I dont need common, and 64 produces longer results for some reason
[09:28] torvalamo: base64 has atob() and btoa()
[09:28] torvalamo: 64 doesn't produce longer results, that's nonsense
[09:29] Daegalus: MTIzNDU2Nzg5MA== vs bv8h5u for 1234567890

[09:33] Nuck: I can quickly bring v8bot on?
[09:33] Daegalus: benvie: the issue is, while tehre is an encode, there is no decode, but it shouldn't be too hard to reverse what the encode does
[09:33] benvie: you must or all hope is lost
[09:33] skylamer`: Why isnt replaceing the '?'s
[09:33] benvie: http://140byt.es/keywords/base64
[09:33] benvie: there's a decode there
[09:33] v8bot_ has joined the channel

[09:34] benvie: oh
[09:34] benvie: well you'll have more trouble locating that
[09:34] Nuck: skylamer`: Because without the global flag on a regex, it won't replace all of them
[09:34] Nuck: skylamer`: Try using a regex (remove the quotes)
[09:34] Daegalus: its on that same page benvie, on the left, but its an encoder with no decode
[09:34] Nuck: Also, ? is a special character in regexes, so you problably want /\?/g
[09:35] benvie: oh there's a base62 one? cool
[09:35] Daegalus: .. atob('1234567890')

[09:36] Nuck: Like, I just take the URL, split on dots, reverse it, and proxy away
[09:36] Daegalus: v8bot is borked
[09:37] Nuck: Clearly o_O
[09:37] Nuck: Lemme try running it on 0.4
[09:37] torvalamo: your base62 thingy stores base64 characters as 8-bit ascii entities (or 16/32/64 bit depending on the system and string encoding)
[09:37] torvalamo: base 62 character*
[09:37] torvalamo: base64 stores it as 6 bits per character + some metadata
[09:37] torvalamo: the metadata will be smaller as the text gets bigger
[09:37] benvie: yeah it's important to note that displayed character amount  !== bytes taken in memory
[09:38] Daegalus: but this will be a fixed size set of numbers.

[09:38] v8bot_: Daegalus: ReferenceError: atob is not defined
[09:38] torvalamo: however you represent base62 it isn't built in to js, so you will always end up with full-size characters
[09:39] benvie: base62 and base64 are only significantly different in size when you're trying to print them out
[09:39] benvie: which you obviously wouldn't be in actual usage

[09:40] torvalamo: base62 uses 6 bits per character exactly as base64, except base64 uses the full 6 bits, whereas base62 uses every possible combination except two.. that's inefficiency that is not acceptable to people with OCD. just so you know

[10:09] eldios: it's long time since I looked inside one (XP) but at that time there was only a "local URL"

[10:11] benvie: Unlike symbolic links, Windows shortcuts maintain their references to their targets even when the target is moved or renamed. Windows domain clients may subscribe to a Windows service called Distributed Link Tracking to track the changes in files and folders to which they are interested. The service maintains the integrity of shortcuts, even when files and folders are moved across the network. 
[10:11] benvie: Additionally, in Windows 9x and later, Windows shell tries to find the target of a broken shortcut before proposing to delete it.

[10:27] Nuck: Because it's the closest thing to a symlink on Windows, and symlinks on Winodws seem to be a commonly-requested thing

[10:28] Doikor: Nuck: whats exacly wrong with mklink?
[10:28] konobi: Nuck: doubtful
[10:28] benvie: which would allow mounting usemode filesystem a la fuse
[10:28] Doikor: other then it only working on vista/7

[10:28] Nuck: Doikor: Only works on Vista/7 :P
[10:28] nmir: like, what was the purpose of parsing the metadata
[10:29] Nuck: Doikor: And is only with NTFS drives too
[10:29] larsschenk has left the channel
[10:29] benvie: you can create filesystem objects that proxy through you basically
[10:29] Eruadan has joined the channel
[10:29] raphael_ has joined the channel
[10:29] benvie: mount points can be drives or folders
[10:29] benvie: basically every option would come in as acallback
[10:29] Doikor: Nuck: if you are still running xp its time to go forward in time. And the ntfs only sucks though
[10:29] Nuck: konobi: I wonder if there might be a way to cram this down the throat of the fs module?
[10:29] Doikor: using xp is like running a 2.2 series linux kernel
[10:29] benvie: so you can create virtual file systems that mount arbitrary data
[10:30] benvie: and present it as normal filesystem
[10:30] Nuck: Doikor: Yeah, not my computer :P
[10:30] benvie: like you could write an adapter for a database or something
[10:30] konobi: Nuck: won't happen... _way_ too many edges
[10:30] benvie: or for sftp
[10:30] Nuck: konobi: Even for making a module that fills it?
[10:30] stagas has joined the channel
[10:31] konobi: Nuck: module... fine... but not core node... it needs to be purely at the pure FS layer
[10:31] konobi: (and that's C space)
[10:31] benvie: actually
[10:31] Nuck: konobi: Yeah, that's understandable
[10:31] benvie: dokan might do what you're trying to have done with the basic minimal example implementation it comes with
[10:31] Nuck: But I'm thinking if we could get a JavaScript parser for lnk files
[10:32] konobi: Nuck: node would still act on the lnk file though
[10:32] aslant has joined the channel
[10:32] Nuck: konobi: Not if I require('fs') and modify the things it outputs, due to caching, right?
[10:33] icebox has joined the channel
[10:33] konobi: Nuck: and all the internal C++/C/libuv interfaces too
[10:33] Nuck: And I dunno if require could be modified?
[10:33] benvie: yes it can
[10:33] Nuck: konobi: The biggest thing I'm looking at is simply the require stuff
[10:33] Nuck: If require can resolve through a .lnk, then I'm happy
[10:33] benvie: I know because I swap our node's core module system for one of my things
[10:33] konobi: Nuck: that might be doable
[10:34] benvie: you just need a simple patch to native module
[10:34] Nuck: In fact, I'd wager that handles most use-cases of symlinks that I've seen ;)
[10:34] benvie: so that all the path resolves go through you
[10:34] maritz has joined the channel
[10:34] benvie: I think all of them use path.resolve already for filesystem stuff right?
[10:34] benvie: most of them
[10:34] Qalqi has joined the channel
[10:34] benvie: so that's a single point that needs to be modified
[10:34] konobi: benvie: would be good to know if they didn't
[10:35] ningu: I use xp on my netbook because windows 7 is so slow on it
[10:35] Nuck: I don't see why we couldn't just put this on the libuv layer
[10:35] Qalqi: dont use windows
[10:35] pickels has joined the channel
[10:35] Nuck: I mean, isn't libuv all about abstracting away the silly differences between platforms?
[10:35] benvie: let me whip up a proof of concept here
[10:35] ningu: qalqi: not an option in my case, I don't use windows when I'm not using the netbook but for my field work I need windows
[10:36] maritz has joined the channel
[10:36] konobi: Nuck: when do you want to read the lnk directly vs not...
[10:36] ningu: I still want to know why libuv is called libuv
[10:36] Nuck: konobi: Aren't symlinks technically just implemented as files containing a reference to their target?
[10:37] socketio\test\80 has joined the channel
[10:37] ningu: but you can still e.g. delete a symlink
[10:37] mikl has joined the channel
[10:37] konobi: Nuck: no... they're different at the open(2) level... for example
[10:37] Nuck: I know hard links are handled as just two pointers to the same chunk of data, but symlinks are a lot softer
[10:38] Nuck: konobi: From what I can tell, symlinks and .lnk files are VERY similar, just abstracted on different levels?
[10:38] konobi: (ie: they're handled in-kernel)
[10:38] Nuck: .lnk depends on the application layer to handle it
[10:38] Nuck: Whereas symlinks are handled in-kernel

[10:39] benvie: yeah I don't see it because it's not commonly supported elsewhere
[10:40] benvie: they're not looking to trailblaze
[10:40] Nuck: Fair enough
[10:40] benvie: but it's still a useful module
[10:40] Nuck: But if it requires a core patch to even function, it's not gonna be feasable
[10:40] benvie: oh it's feasible
[10:40] benvie: give me 20 mins
[10:40] Nuck: Not if it requires a core patch
[10:40] Nuck: It may be POSSIBLE
[10:41] Nuck: But it's not usable for just about any case
[10:41] konobi: monkey-patching would be frowned upon too
[10:41] Nuck: Yeah
[10:41] Nuck: If it could be handled entirely in a module, overloading the require resolver, THEN it could work
[10:41] benvie: well you got me there and the foundation of this requires some supreme monkeypatching
[10:41] benvie: well
[10:41] benvie: it doesn't require monkeypatching to work
[10:42] benvie: it just requires monkeypatching to ninja force all of node to use it
[10:42] Nuck: haha yeah
[10:42] konobi: yeah... at which point... everyone will say "yeah... not supported" for any strange use-cases

[12:41] lowerkey: maritz: for some reason it doesn't. When I contact.save() and immediately afterwards read the value, I get the formatDate() string, but it doesn't get stored in the db.
[12:41] maritz: lowerkey: actually, your function doesn't accept strings and should throw an exception

[12:42] lowerkey: oh wait
[12:42] lowerkey: it
[12:42] lowerkey: it's not

[12:43] lowerkey: changing it in stackoverflow
[12:45] maritz: so, you're actually setting the date in the datetime format. in that case you could look at the SQL logs and see what's in the query. if that doesn't show you what's wrong you'll have to debug through sequelize

[13:02] Emerson: Hi there. I was wondering if you guys could help me to think asynchronously. I'm using node-tds to handle Microsoft SQL database. I have table A and B and a n to n relationship called C. In order to insert something in table C I must check if the primary key of A and B exist in their respective tables before with a SELECT statement.
[13:03] Emerson: Is there any sample code that does that?

[13:06] maritz: Emerson: don't know. but why not just try it yourself? :)
[13:07] maritz: especially if you're new to async programming you should read up on that and then experiment with it. once you feel comfortable, use the async module :)
[13:07] Emerson: I'm trying. :) But I don't want to write a terrible code, because I'm still thiking synchronouslyl.
[13:09] maritz: then write terrible code and improve it :)

[13:38] ningu: most modules I use don't have any attached libraries
[13:39] davman: so I've tried node-gitteh and nodegit, both require the libgit2 library. From what I can tell both the modules and the library should compile to the best available arch, in my case 64bit

[16:01] wingie: you should read tutorials about node.js
[16:01] trakowski77: I'm used to more centralized documentation.. 
[16:01] wingie: and use that one as API reference
[16:02] wingie: read a book
[16:02] trakowski77: I've done one tutorial about node.. that went well 
[16:02] wingie: don't read api doc to get the big pic
[16:04] trakowski77: I think I generally understand the big picture of node.js. What I have difficulty with is getting some modules to work. I tried Mustache, for templating, and I can't get it to do anything. 
[16:04] trakowski77: For example: I'm having difficulties on how I should name a template file

[16:22] Nss has joined the channel
[16:23] ningu: some of that, e.g. the session user, is something you don't need socket.io for. but upcoming events sound like a better use case.
[16:23] aslanted has joined the channel
[16:23] maritz: ningu: especially the ability to send stuff from the server to the client
[16:24] jocafa: tjholowaychuk:  the little green arrow icon is driving me insane: http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/images/reporter-html.png
[16:24] ningu: yeah
[16:24] maritz: everytime i edit css in my app, it tells the client and the css change is immediately visible. same with js, but it reloads the page for js
[16:24] jocafa: *click click click*
[16:24] ningu: so I take it there's a socket.io for client side
[16:24] tjholowaychuk: jocafa what
[16:25] jocafa: the "there's an update available for chrome" icon in that screenshot

[16:26] illourr has joined the channel
[16:27] ningu: hmm... so I suppose in theory you could have an app served by something other than node and just use node for the server-side socket.io
[16:27] ningu: I suppose what I'm wondering is a theoretical thing -- can you go only partway with js on the server ;)
[16:28] Zzaichik has joined the channel
[16:28] chjj: ningu: people try the "node as a side-dish" route all the time
[16:28] ningu: chjj: using ipc?

[16:28] yawNO: trello is cool
[16:28] yawNO: kinda beta yet but cool
[16:29] illourr: my whole team uses it.
[16:29] sandfox: ningu: we do that for a project
[16:29] RLa: why not node for whole project?
[16:29] chjj: ningu: yeah, well they have to end up doing a lot of hacky things. i remember a while ago, it seemed like every day someone was in here asking for a way to share php sessions with node
[16:29] mikl has joined the channel
[16:29] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[16:30] sandfox: we have more php devs who feel comfortable writing application logic in php
[16:30] nathanielk: there was also the "how to serve php through node"
[16:30] RLa: time to change!
[16:30] M1l3n1um has joined the channel
[16:30] sandfox: yeah, i'd like them all too but hey
[16:30] ningu: RLa: for my small project all-node is perfect, I was just thinking that there must be people who want to use something node does well but keep their existing setup
[16:30] chjj: someone should write a php implementation for node, with the whole apache api with it and whatnot
[16:30] chjj: i bet it would be faster than apache+php
[16:31] chjj: just compile to js
[16:31] ningu: are there benchmarks of node+jade vs. php?
[16:31] maritz: sharing sessions should be really simple because they should be in some kind of cache/db... can be accessed from both. you have the same "problem" in a pure node.js solution unless you store all sessions in memory in which case you have other problems :P
[16:31] RLa: chjj, it's already done in java
[16:31] jsull_ has joined the channel
[16:31] sandropadin has joined the channel
[16:31] chjj: call it, node-pache
[16:31] ningu: maritz: yes, but with pure node you have the option of not needing to share sessions, it could all be one app
[16:31] RLa: chjj, bigger problem is how php is supposed to be executed
[16:31] larsschenk has joined the channel
[16:31] ningu: RLa: firing squad
[16:31] RLa: i.e a page is a script
[16:32] larsschenk1 has joined the channel
[16:32] chjj: RLa: why is that a problem?
[16:32] chjj: RLa: php is essentially a giant templating language
[16:32] RLa: and urls map directly to pages, and you have no persistent data state (other than db and session)
[16:32] dob_ has joined the channel
[16:32] maritz: ningu: you still need to share the session between normal http requests and websockets. and it's kind of a pain, because you don't get the session cookie in websockets afaik.
[16:32] larsschenk1 has left the channel
[16:32] chjj: yeah, you could do that, why would it be hard to implement?
[16:33] enyovelcora has left the channel
[16:33] RLa: chjj, existsing scripts and devs mindset does not support executing php in other ways
[16:33] chjj: or you could revamp php, and just not bother with the same apache+php semantics/api
[16:33] RLa: that is the problem
[16:34] chjj: RLa: im saying it should be implemented accurately
[16:34] chjj: *not* just a simple compilation to js
[16:34] ningu: why does everyone hate apache, anyway... is it the performance or the general messiness of it?
[16:34] bkaney has joined the channel
[16:34] RLa: i do not hate
[16:34] chjj: implement the api too, set up an http server for it, etc
[16:35] chjj: ningu: i dont hate apache, where did you get that idea?
[16:35] mschneider has joined the channel
[16:35] ningu: chjj: I didn't mean you specifically, I just get the sense that people don't like it much
[16:35] ningu: but maybe I'm wrong
[16:35] chjj: i like it, it helped pave the way for the web in the early days
[16:35] RLa: apache is complex beast, and sometimes not easy to configure
[16:36] mandric has joined the channel
[16:36] chjj: imagine if it wasnt apache, but microsoft's IIS that was #1 in the early days or something
[16:36] chjj: i feel like the web would be a very different place
[16:36] chjj: were lucky it was apache
[16:37] RLa: is it was not apache, there would be something else to replace iis
[16:37] RLa: but apache is from times of mostly static html
[16:37] jtsnow has joined the channel
[16:37] RLa: and execution models such as php's are becoming less and less popular
[16:37] chjj: right, i mean, i wouldnt be using apache today.
[16:38] chjj: yeah, i wonder how long the tradition web server will be around for
[16:38] baudehlo: chjj: haha, you haven't been around very long - IIS was #1 for a good long while back in the day.
[16:38] dthompso99 has joined the channel
[16:38] ningu: chjj: ok, maybe I should have phrased it as: why do people not use apache as their first choice anymore
[16:38] RLa: and execution models such as ruby, python and node frameworks use, do not work comfortably with apache
[16:39] chjj: baudehlo: i was making websites in the early 2000s
[16:39] chjj: baudehlo: i dont remember that, maybe im wrong
[16:39] kenperkins has joined the channel
[16:39] ningu: I remember IIS being popular, but have no idea what %
[16:39] ningu: afaik it was never bigger than apache
[16:39] ningu: but more people had heard of IIS
[16:39] chjj: this ^

[17:20] ningu: ShaneHudson: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules for various modules
[17:20] jaha: well im using rpc (dnode) to keep the connection alive for socket comm, and thought id like to keep it inside that without going through http (express) if i didnt need to
[17:20] ShaneHudson: yeah I might as well jump straight into the deep end. Though perhaps first I need to come up with a small project to make!

[17:34] JacobSingh: Using express, I want to pass a variable to the client.  I found express-expose, but that extends "app".  What is the best practice for passing my var back?  I'm already inside a route which is in a require'd file.
[17:34] trakowski77 has left the channel
[17:34] hatch: actually I have no idea if that's the most recent version...I just saw 1.1.1 at the bottom of the docs
[17:34] hatch: the version number isn't really promoted
[17:34] JacobSingh: I would think express-expose would do res.expose(myObj); but sadly no.  Still not clear on how you access "app".  Is it a singleton?  Is there some hidden function to get at it?
[17:35] lz: hatch weird, you should be able to get 1.1.1 that way
[17:35] tjholowaychuk: JacobSingh it extends the prototype
[17:35] tjholowaychuk: for express 2.x
[17:35] lz: hatch how did you install npm originally?
[17:36] spolu: hi guys
[17:36] hatch: lz: no idea, I'm guessing using the sh method
[17:36] spolu: I get some DNS related errors that cause an 'error' event to be emitted

[17:38] tjholowaychuk: or export the callbacks only
[17:38] tjholowaychuk: and do
[17:38] zacksam has joined the channel

[17:43] JacobSingh: tjholowaychuk: hmm… okay, still not totally clear on that, but I"ll keep digging around.  I'm using your template of having the routes in a require.  I'm not sure how to make the app global though… would you do this: routes = require('./routes); app = module.exports = express….; routes.app = app?
[17:44] jaha: JacobSingh: var app = module.exports = express.createServer();
[17:44] lz: hatch anytime

[18:54] ningu: michaelmartinez: any idea which are the most complete/mature/widespread?
[18:54] illourr: trello uses backbone.. i know that much :P
[18:54] michaelmartinez: Backbone seems more mature than most
[18:54] iangreenleaf: Yeah. Dear everyone, if you write a new client-side JS framework, your landing page needs to have a rationale on it.
[18:54] ningu: michaelmartinez: also, you were pretty good for the phillies last year
[18:54] michaelmartinez: Backbone doesn't fit my brain, at all.
[18:55] dmwuw: iangreenleaf: Thank you, I couldn't agree more.
[18:55] iangreenleaf: Don't tell me about all the features it has that every other framework has too. Tell me why I should use *your* framework.
[18:55] michaelmartinez: iangreenleaf or a todo app : )
[18:55] iangreenleaf: michaelmartinez: Heh :)
[18:55] ningu: well, you can say that for server-side frameworks too. I just think people know enough about those already to know what their options are already.
[18:56] dmwuw: iangreenleaf: Or at least, how to decide if your new framework matches my particular needs.
[18:56] ningu: whereas makers of client-side frameworks seem to often present it as paradigm-changing etc. even though many are very similar.
[18:56] RobWC has joined the channel
[18:57] iangreenleaf: dmwuw: Right. I want to know what you, the developer, love and hate in a framework. If I agree with you, we may get along.
[18:57] michaelmartinez: Yeah, I am actually pretty excited about JsRender/JsViews by Boris Moore
[18:57] michaelmartinez: Its not beta yet, however.
[18:57] iangreenleaf: ningu: Yeah, it's just especially apparent in client-side JS because that space is movign pretty fast right now
[18:58] ningu: do client-side frameworks typically integrate with client-side templates in any... erm... sensible or predictable way?
[18:58] hipsterslapfight has joined the channel
[18:58] iangreenleaf: ningu: I think the three you mentioned *are* the most mature/widespread, btw.
[18:58] ningu: I haven't really used any of them much. just trying to get a sense of them right now, reading some of their pages.

[19:00] iangreenleaf: ningu: Some of them let you choose your templating language, and there are a bunch of options (mustache, etc). Knockout uses HTML with data-bind attributes, IIRC.
[19:00] ningu: I'm still not sold that rest on the server and page rendering client side is really the right answer in general
[19:00] ningu: I think it depends on your site
[19:00] michaelmartinez: Ember and Knockout have bindings which make otherwise craptacular wiring; simple and pleasureable 
[19:01] ningu: iangreenleaf: right, but then if I want to use jade for example, I'd have to load that myself and then call knockout, presumably.
[19:01] st_luke has joined the channel
[19:01] ningu: and the jade templates would have the data-bind attributes in them
[19:02] michaelmartinez: Ningu, no... If using a client side fw with bindings I would serve JSON
[19:02] iangreenleaf: ningu: Yeah, that's the cool part about knockout (and batman) - you can generate the HTML server-side with your favorite template engine.
[19:02] betaloop has joined the channel
[19:02] ningu: michaelmartinez: the html has to come from somewhere. what would knockout do with json?
[19:02] michaelmartinez: Or you could do it server side... 
[19:02] mikeal has joined the channel
[19:03] michaelmartinez: It would automagically convert it to models which populates the vieews
[19:03] ningu: yes, but the views have to come from somewhere
[19:04] ningu: data as json is sensible enough, that's not what I meant
[19:04] sreeix has joined the channel
[19:04] michaelmartinez: The views live inside the html and are bound to the models

[20:17] nibblebot: if I fork a pkg that's in npm at v0.3.5 for example, and I reference my github/master link in my app's package.json, is it possible to get `npm install` to treat this pkg at a higher version without bumping version number in my forked repo's package.json
[20:18] torvalamo: syntax error
[20:18] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[20:18] torvalamo: statement too long
[20:19] torvalamo: so w hat you're asking is whether you can ignore the version number for dependencies?
[20:19] nibblebot: for dependencies that use url's
[20:20] nibblebot: so if fork/patch/pull request a package that's in npm, i'd have to bumb the package # to use my patched vbersion in production

[20:20] nibblebot: if i want to use `npm install` to update my packages (which i do)
[20:21] torvalamo: using the master branch as a dependency may be a bad idea
[20:21] torvalamo: what if there is a bug in the working commit
[20:22] torvalamo: which breaks it
[20:22] nibblebot: i mean, the forked branch is under my repo
[20:22] nibblebot: it's not upstream
[20:22] chjj: i thought it might be nice to be able to have an npm package point to a stable branch in a git repo
[20:23] nibblebot: i mean, really i could just bump version number, but i don't think that's too friendly for pull requests, right?
[20:23] chjj: or is that not what youre talking about? i just decided to enter the conversation abruptly
[20:23] isaacs: chjj: "dependencies": { "foo": "git+ssh://github.com/user/foo.git#stable-branch-name" }
[20:23] isaacs: chjj: like that? ^
[20:24] nibblebot: chjj: i don't mind using master
[20:24] chjj: isaacs: i mean the package itself, instead of grabbing a tarball, tries to pull from a git branch
[20:24] chjj: not necessarily a dependency
[20:24] jskulski has joined the channel
[20:25] isaacs: chjj: you can npm install a git url as well.
[20:25] isaacs: chjj: or you can just have it be a checkout or submodule into node_modules/foo if you really want, but then you have to pull using git, not using npm.
[20:25] isaacs: chjj: but you can do `npm explore foo -- git pull`
[20:26] kevwil has joined the channel
[20:26] chjj: isaacs: hmmm, is there anyway to configure a package.json in such a way that it just pulls from the head of a git branch when someone does 'npm install x'?
[20:26] cjm has joined the channel
[20:27] nibblebot: just wondering what other folks are doing as i find myself now maintaining several forks and switching from an npm dep to a github fork w/o bumping the version number in the fork means `npm install` won't update it. I need to explicitly do `npm install foo`
[20:28] chjj: isaacs: i might have missed it. i asked you about this a while ago, i think you said it was in the works.
[20:28] isaacs: chjj: no
[20:28] chjj: ah, alright
[20:29] isaacs: chjj: `npm install x@git+ssh://....` would work, though :)
[20:30] chjj: cool. its not a big deal. in reality, im fine with doing `npm publish` instead of `git push origin stable`. i just drawn towards consistency i guess.

[20:51] skylamer`: is there some other desings, isaacs ? :)
[20:52] tmike: baudehlo then you miss out on blocks and helpers and such

[20:57] ningu: btw, I'm not sure whose package xregexp is, but the latest push is broken
[20:57] isaacs: saebekassebil: so, there are three problems right away that i can see...
[20:57] isaacs: saebekassebil: 1, you're using cygwin,which is no longer supported (windows is a first-class citizen now)
[20:57] isaacs: 2. you're using npm 1.0.9, which is very old
[20:58] isaacs: 3. you're using node 0.4.2, which is crazy old.
[20:58] isaacs: it'd be better to use node 0.6.11, and npm 1.1.1, on windows as-is.
[20:58] isaacs: but, barring that for some reason, use a proper unix in a vm or something
[20:58] thurmda has joined the channel
[20:59] isaacs: at the very least, upgrade to npm 1.0.106
[20:59] isaacs: and node 0.4.12
[20:59] isaacs: apart from that, have you done `npm adduser` on this machine?  it seems like the username isn't getting set.
[20:59] saebekassebil: isaacs: Yea, well the cygwin is a lousy compensation for a proper Linux system - And I've seen that cygwin isn't supported anylonger, problem is that Windows cmd is awfull
[20:59] saebekassebil: isaacs: Yea, been adduser'ing about 10 times now :)
[20:59] isaacs: saebekassebil: if you install git, you can tick the box to get bash in windows that works, mostly
[20:59] isaacs: and you can use the git bash shell, which is pretty nice
[21:00] saebekassebil: But I'll try to update. Is there any chance that I can still use the cygwin/mintty shell?

[21:12] joe__k: scope
[21:13] jtikalsky has joined the channel

[21:14] tuhoojabotti: oh python
[21:14] joe__k: in python, dir() returns a list of all the names in scope
[21:14] CoverSlide: i don't know of anything that does dir() with no arguments though
[21:15] joe__k: i want to know all the variables/names in scope, programmatically
[21:15] joe__k: the same as hitting "tab" at the node prompt, but programmatically
[21:15] c4milo has joined the channel
[21:15] joe__k: the goal: I am using mocha's "expect" style syntax, and I need to know how to access things set in "before"
[21:16] joe__k: and I want to print the list of defined vars in my test func
[21:16] CoverSlide: tab just gives you everything in global
[21:16] joe__k: right, because when you're at the prompt you're not inside a function scope
[21:16] joe__k: but yeah
[21:16] tjholowaychuk: joe__k declare them outside
[21:16] tjholowaychuk: of before()
[21:16] joe__k: the alternative is to somehow debug, but I have never gotten debug to work properly
[21:17] tjholowaychuk: var foo;  before(function(){ foo = whatever
[21:17] tjholowaychuk: if that's what you mean
[21:17] joe__k: well its in coffescript, which vars everything....
[21:17] tjholowaychuk: well yeah
[21:17] tjholowaychuk: sucks to use coffeescript
[21:17] joe__k: I think I can say {global} but I dont really want it in the global score
[21:17] joe__k: scope
[21:17] joe__k: actually, coffescript isnt the issue, and coffescript is also awsome
[21:17] CoverSlide: yeah it's not a feature of JavaScript
[21:17] joe__k: the issue is that the test framework is getting an object literal, not a "function to call to setup and run things"
[21:18] CoverSlide: for better or worse
[21:18] chjj: i cant help but think coffeescript's removal of var was just for people who dont understand function scope
[21:18] slickplaid: res.download(path)... what's the path? I have files in ./download/<files> and 'download/filename' './download/filename', '/download/filename' all don't work... What am I missing?
[21:18] tjholowaychuk: slickplaid they're from the CWD if it's not an absolute path
[21:18] chjj: or who dont want to understand it*
[21:19] tjholowaychuk: chjj noobs will be noobs
[21:19] joe__k: so I can't declare them outside, because there isn't an enclosing lexical scope - just the parent of the contained sub-object
[21:19] CoverSlide: slickplaid: try __dirname + '/download/filename'
[21:19] joe__k: (not a functional call chain - just a hierarchical object literal)
[21:19] slickplaid: ok, trying that now :D
[21:19] CoverSlide: of course __dirname is the directory of the current script
[21:19] chjj: tjholowaychuk: i guess so

[21:20] chjj: again, its because people were crying about function scope
[21:20] tjholowaychuk: it can be very helpful actually
[21:20] chjj: lets add let statements!
[21:20] joe__k: oh really. can you reason what a function called "it" does ?
[21:20] joe__k: and how it sets up the testing object model for the test runner?
[21:20] tricon_ has joined the channel
[21:21] ningu: actually, my main issue with scope in js is not understanding how it works -- it's that with async coding you have two choices, indent things a billion times and write awful code, or pass a bunch of variables along through a daisy chain
[21:21] chjj: i dont think i will ever use let statements once theyre implemented
[21:21] tjholowaychuk: lol..
[21:21] ningu: neither seems particularly elegant
[21:21] joe__k: being a python guy, i think the "cutesy" non-dsls are pretty silly
[21:21] tjholowaychuk: you're using one
[21:21] joe__k: a dsl isn't just ruby/js with renamed functions...
[21:21] tjholowaychuk: it's called coffeescript
[21:21] tuhoojabotti: Should I do Object.create(original) to mess around with a copy?
[21:21] ningu: I've taken to passing things through in a collection called stash, that has a collection of variables the next function will need
[21:21] CoverSlide: or use named functions
[21:22] CoverSlide: option 3
[21:22] joe__k: coffescript isn't a "ruby kid" dsl... its a language with a grammar, parser, and compiler
[21:22] tuhoojabotti: or is there some fancy way
[21:22] tjholowaychuk: joe__k right
[21:22] tjholowaychuk: anyone with a keyboard
[21:22] tjholowaychuk: can write
[21:22] tuhoojabotti: tjholowaychuk: Unless it's a broken keyboard.
[21:22] ningu: what about a cat with a keyboard?
[21:23] tuhoojabotti: Also: on-screen-keyboard anyone
[21:23] iain_: anyone with a keyboard can write faster with the dvorak layout :p
[21:23] CoverSlide: scoping in js is simple, it just requires you to learn it
[21:23] chjj: ningu: you shouldnt be doing `somethingAsync(nextFunc)`. you should nest these callbacks deeply, but keep the content of the callbacks in separate functions
[21:23] ningu: chjj: yes, but then those functions don't have access to the enclosing scope
[21:23] chjj: ningu: e.g. somethingAsync(function() { somethingAsync2(a, b, c, function() { ... }); });`
[21:23] CoverSlide: if you need the scope then declare them where you need them
[21:24] CoverSlide: no need for nesting

[21:24] jtikalsky: ningu... it sounds like you've almost defined an "object"
[21:24] ningu: it's an issue when you're doing a five step procedure and each step requires an async call, and together they build up a data structure
[21:24] chjj: ningu: yes they do, but you only give them access to what they need this way, every function gets access to what it needs, so you dont have to pass in a ton of variables
[21:24] ningu: jtikalsky: that's why I pass a single var through
[21:25] jtikalsky: the reference to "stash"?
[21:25] ningu: yes... I just find it necessary to package things that way more often with this kind of coding
[21:25] chjj: ningu: write one function that does a very specific asynchronous thing, and string them together, they shouldnt need access to *all* the variables in the scope
[21:25] jtikalsky: right
[21:25] jtikalsky: so the scope is the "object" scope of stash
[21:26] dropbr has joined the channel
[21:26] jtikalsky: if I understand you correctly
[21:26] ningu: yes, once you've split it into separate functions
[21:26] jtikalsky: do do you write object methods as well?
[21:26] ningu: I guess what I find frustrating is that often these functions are one or two lines. so sync code would be like 10 lines, and it becomes 25 with all the declarations
[21:27] ningu: jtikalsky: so far these have all been one-off things where it isn't obvious that doing that would lead to any code sharing
[21:28] chjj: ningu: youll become more comfortable with it eventually
[21:28] jtikalsky: well, you're organizing your variables it seems
[21:28] ningu: yeah
[21:28] jtikalsky: rather than just dumping everything into the global scope
[21:28] ningu: no, that would clealy be a lousy idea

[21:28] ningu: but the variables together don't necessarily make a coherent object except in the context of that one method, or small set of methods
[21:29] ningu: it's not that much of a hassle, really, but it takes some getting used to
[21:29] ningu: I've been breaking things down more as I get used to it
[21:29] jtikalsky: well the next step would be to group the variables more logically I suppose
[21:30] joe__k: tjholowaychuk: you are the mocha guy, right? is the expect ui worse than the other uis, for solely this reason?
[21:30] joe__k: because there is no implicit functional closure over more specified tests?
[21:30] tjholowaychuk: joe__k: you can use "this" as well
[21:30] tjholowaychuk: this.foo = 'bar'
[21:30] ningu: jtikalsky: part of the issue is that this project is for my research, and needs will develop as my research develops, so I can't say beforehand what the featureset will be
[21:30] tjholowaychuk: joe__k it's just less flexible than the other UIs
[21:30] ningu: or what variable groupings will necessarily be needed
[21:30] joe__k: tjholowaychuk: i like its declarativeness
[21:30] jtikalsky: ningu, that's the beauty of JavaScript
[21:30] tjholowaychuk: but "this" is a mocha.Context
[21:31] jtikalsky: you don't define object classes
[21:31] ningu: joe__k: chances are tj is the answer to "are you the * guy?"
[21:31] jtikalsky: objects are just really just dictionaries
[21:31] tuhoojabotti: "I wrote a program with Node.js and it's in production. AMA."
[21:31] ningu: yeah, I guess I could put the methods on right when I make the object the first time
[21:31] tuhoojabotti: ":D"
[21:32] matt_c has joined the channel
[21:32] ningu: I often have one-off functions within my routes -- things that several branches could lead to
[21:32] dshaw_ has joined the channel
[21:33] jtikalsky: well, another nice thing is that you can share the code of a method on several objects
[21:33] jtikalsky: no need to write it twice
[21:33] jtikalsky: anyway, I think your approach is pretty good
[21:33] jtikalsky: :)
[21:35] SuMarDi has joined the channel
[21:35] Lingerance: <jtikalsky> well, another nice thing is that you can share the code of a method on several objects <-- Object1.prototype.foo = Object2.prototype.foo = function() { ... } // ?
[21:36] jtikalsky: Lingerance, yes that would work I suppose
[21:37] jtikalsky: I'm not sure I'd write it like that
[21:37] Lingerance: I'd have it seperated out, but yeah
[21:38] jtikalsky: you also don't have to reference a prototype if you don't want to
[21:38] jtikalsky: your choice
[21:38] Lingerance: What?
[21:39] jtikalsky: I'm trying to think of a good example

[21:49] lduros has left the channel
[21:49] Lingerance: As did I
[21:49] jtikalsky: there is a reference to the function
[21:49] Lingerance: You can assign anonymous functions to a variable

[21:50] Lingerance: ryan_stevens: I am aware

[21:50] ryan_stevens: Lingerance: That those still don't show up in stack traces?

[21:52] bradleymeck: grep -r "function mynamedFunction" vs grep -r "function", one will win more often

[21:52] Lingerance: var isManOrMuppet = function() {
[21:52] Lingerance: All of them are actually anonymous
[21:52] jtikalsky: ok
[21:53] jtikalsky: how would you fix that?
[21:53] Lingerance: function isManOrMuppet() {
[21:53] vrracing has joined the channel
[21:53] jtikalsky: ah ok I see the distinction you''re making now
[21:54] Lingerance: Or: var isManOrMuppet = function manOrMuppetCheck() {

[21:57] cmwelsh: bradleymeck: thank you mate
[21:57] jtikalsky: definitely useful
[21:57] Lingerance: Like I said, makes stack traces nice
[21:57] jtikalsky: Yes, I can see how that would be very very helpful
[21:57] cmwelsh: I wish CoffeeScript did that for you
[21:58] cmwelsh: it seems silly especially when the JavaScript is being auto generated not to have *something*
[21:58] cmwelsh: perhaps I just haven't figured it out yet :)
[21:59] joe__k: tjholowaychuk: "this" (mocha.Context) seems a bit wonky, like its mutated for each test serially, versus being hierarchially defined

[22:52] AvianFlu: lacker, no

[22:52] AvianFlu: there are 'official' ones for 0.4.x

[22:53] AvianFlu: so, I'm glad he does it, but if it errors, I wouldn't keep messing with it
[22:53] lacker: joyent does link to them... they should probably fix that
[22:53] lacker: the ubuntu package version of node doesnt seem to work with downloaded npm, either
[22:54] lacker: so the ubuntu package appears to be fubarred
[22:54] lacker: anywhere in particular i should report that?
[22:54] AvianFlu: I'm not completely sure
[22:54] DavidIAm: the deb package should have a maintainer email in it.
[22:55] AvianFlu: lacker, I put this on github because of people having trouble with package managers https://github.com/AvianFlu/getnode/blob/master/getnode

[22:55] AvianFlu: I mean, yeah, definitely
[22:55] lacker: ubuntu seems likely to be the most common deployment environment

[22:58] DavidIAm: Nate - I want to have a build tree, where npm installs as if I had it in a targz or something.

[23:19] DavidIAm: but document stores store json, not js.

[23:19] DavidIAm: With software, any combination of bit-twiddling is possible!
[23:20] DavidIAm: ACTION is an expert bit-twiddler.
[23:20] cris_: I wouldn't store the js, just references to methods
[23:20] TooTallNate: and then where would the methods be stored?
[23:21] cris_: in a js file, when a user adds a new field they would only select from a selection of pre-defined validators etc...
[23:21] ritch1: cris_: this isnt entirely complete but similar to what you are asking for - https://github.com/deployd/deployd
