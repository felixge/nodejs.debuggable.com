[00:31] jhbot: TypeError: object is not a function

[00:31] TheJH: DrMcKay, v8 changed its behavior related to using regexes as functions
[00:31] DrMcKay: oh, I see
[00:31] TheJH: DrMcKay, it doesn't work anymore
[00:32] DrMcKay: yes, node shell throws

[00:32] TheJH: !admin eval var result; try { result = (/a/).exec("a") } catch (e) { result = e }; result
[00:32] jhbot: a
[00:32] AvianFlu: the direct function call syntax was alias for that anyway
[00:32] chrisdickinson: v8: (function(obj) { try { obj.x = 3; return obj; } finally { obj.y = 1; }})({})
[00:32] v8bot_: chrisdickinson: {"x": 3, "y": 1}
[00:33] Sembiance: DrMcKay: it's more work once you start wanting to handle http redirects, gzip decoding, additional request headers, posting form data, etc.  I'd rather not build yet another wheel when there are about 1,000 of these particular wheels already available. I'll look through the npm list and see if I can find a nice wheel I like, was just wondering if someone had a wheel they already really liked :)

[00:35] chrisdickinson: TheJH: full inflate/deflate implementation with support for gzip blocks/headers?
[00:36] chrisdickinson: (and is not https://github.com/dankogai/js-deflate)?
[00:37] TheJH: chrisdickinson, I've already done a working gzip reader except for the inflate and checksum stuff :D - it outputs the raw, still compressed (=deflated) bytes, but without gzip headers
[00:38] chrisdickinson: ooo.

[00:40] secoif: nevermind, sorted it out, though it'd be nice to have a shorthand for that, meh (for the http.get body += chunks on data stuff)
[00:40] chrisdickinson: TheJH: I tracked this stuff down a while back, let me double check.

[00:44] robot_jesus: whats the dnode channel again ?
[00:44] DrMcKay: we need some git linking stuff
[00:44] TheJH: DrMcKay, git linking?
[00:44] DrMcKay: TheJH: wasn't your bot doing something like that?
[00:44] TheJH: DrMcKay, what exactly do you want?
[00:44] DrMcKay: project, user maybe?
[00:45] DrMcKay: !gh mikeal/request
[00:45] TheJH: !remember gh https://github.com/$/$
[00:45] jhbot: saved definition of 'gh'
[00:45] TheJH: !mem gh mikeal request
[00:45] DrMcKay: would output https://gihub.com/mikeal/request
[00:45] jhbot: https://github.com/mikeal/request
[00:45] robot_jesus: so I've starting using hashtags in my comments, like // TODO:  Fix this to be asynch #r1 #eventually , and just wrote a node program to parse these out and display them in a grid.  Kind of a quick ticket system for programmers, would anyone use that ?  git integrations, trac, etc 
[00:46] TheJH: DrMcKay, how about that? Everyone can "remember" stuff, by the way
[00:46] TheJH: (and overwrite it)
[00:46] DrMcKay: robot_jesus: I would!
[00:46] DrMcKay: it's fun to visualize code
[00:47] DrMcKay: DrMcKay: you want to remember all relevant projects?
[00:47] DrMcKay: TheJH: ^
[00:47] TheJH: chrisdickinson, whoah, JSXCompressor looks good, too :)
[00:48] chrisdickinson: TheJH: yep. the biggest issue i had with it is that it didn't include a deflate half.
[00:48] TheJH: a deflate half?
[00:48] chrisdickinson: sorry, it can inflate things, but it can't deflate things.
[00:48] chrisdickinson: (which is half of what git does, so... kind of an important piece :)
[00:49] chrisdickinson: (disclaimer: i'm not the author of git.js, just helping out with it. was working on my own pure js git implementation when git.js came out.)

[00:51] DrMcKay: robot_jesus: ping?
[00:52] chrisdickinson: TheJH: deflate == "compress", inflate == "decompress", i mean. since it can't compress data, you couldn't use it to, say, write git objects.
[00:52] chrisdickinson: unless i totally missed something.
[00:52] TheJH: ah, yes
[00:52] chrisdickinson: which is totally possible.
[00:52] TheJH: sorry
[00:52] chrisdickinson: oh no! i was doubting myself there for a moment :)
[00:52] Sembiance: heh, it's funny, started out with dust.js as a template language, ditched it and went with mustache, and now I'm back to dust.js :)
[00:52] TheJH: well, but I think inflate is more important for mikeals request or npm or so
[00:53] chrisdickinson: TheJH: oh yeah, definitely.
[00:53] chrisdickinson: but, since dakongai's stuff works with inflate and deflate, git.js ended up going that direction.
[00:53] chrisdickinson: as for the license, i could've sworn i had found it after like, days of digging.
[00:54] TheJH: ChrisBuchholz, it'd be fairly easy to create a spec-compliant deflater... if you don't want the size to be reduced. :D
[00:54] TheJH: just specify the no-compression-compression-method
[00:54] chrisdickinson: s/dakongai/dankogai/g

[00:56] chrisdickinson: haha
[00:57] robot_jesus: DrMcKay, yep ?
[00:57] chrisdickinson: sorry, that was the source of the "/me coughs" ;)
[00:57] TheJH: chrisdickinson, yes, saw that
[00:57] chrisdickinson: TheJH: the other idea i had was to use libpng to "implement" zlib support.
[00:57] DrMcKay: robot_jesus: I would love to hear more about that project
[00:57] daed: use libpng to implement zlib?
[00:57] daed: chris you're a rational man
[00:58] daed: let's not go psycho here :P
[00:58] DrMcKay: robot_jesus: that hashtag visualization
[00:58] chrisdickinson: png blocks are compressed using raw deflate.
[00:58] AvianFlu: v8: /abc/.exec('abcdefghi')
[00:58] v8bot_: AvianFlu: ["abc"]
[00:58] daed: still..
[00:58] chrisdickinson: use canvas to create an image.
[00:58] chrisdickinson: write to the canvas, subpixel by subpixel, the data you'd like to compress.
[00:58] TheJH: aaah
[00:59] AvianFlu: v8: /abc(.*)/.exec('abcdefghi')
[00:59] v8bot_: AvianFlu: ["abcdefghi", "defghi"]
[00:59] TheJH: AvianFlu, what are you doing there?
[00:59] chrisdickinson: read it back as a png, strip off the png header and footer blocks, and there's your compressed data.
[00:59] robot_jesus: DrMcKay, private chat sent :)
[00:59] AvianFlu: just making sure of something
[01:00] chrisdickinson: additionally, that makes for a really nice side step around "localStorage" limits -- upload that image file someplace, serve it with a "cache forever" etag, and the browser will keep a copy of it around indefinitely for you to load the data back out of.
[01:00] chrisdickinson: plus, if you've got BlobBuilder available, you can write the compressed data into a fake-png, open it up as a canvas, and read the decompressed bits out (subpixel by subpixel, again).
[01:01] DrMcKay: chrisdickinson: + you can do a god-moded cookie
[01:01] chrisdickinson: you know, this solution being at the far side of the crazy scale.
[01:02] chrisdickinson: the really cool thing is, if you've got git support in browser, all your page has to send down is the latest 40-byte hash of the client javascript.
[01:02] apollo_ has joined the channel
[01:02] chrisdickinson: if you need to update, open up a websocket and speak the git protocol and pull down a compressed delta of all the changes, re-execute. store results in localstorage, or someplace else.
[01:02] chrisdickinson: sort of how chrome updates itself.
[01:02] TheJH: :D, coool
[01:04] DrMcKay: chrisdickinson: how did you even get there from deflate?
[01:05] chrisdickinson: DrMcKay: I was originally interested in an in-browser implementation of git -- and git leans really heavily on deflate and inflate.
[01:06] chrisdickinson: git.js was released (by dan lucraft) recently. i've been working on fixing it up and getting packaged for node -- as well as speeding up portions of it in-browser

[01:06] DrMcKay: TheJH: I guess no

[01:07] DrMcKay: chrisdickinson: oh, that's neat
[01:07] chrisdickinson: thanks :)
[01:07] chrisdickinson: but, the native js inflate / deflate is pretty slow, so i'm still sort of enamoured with the idea of somehow using png's as a speedier way to get at inflated and deflated data.

[04:04] dominictarr: var opened = 0, closed = 0
[04:04] kinane: yeah. cool. 
[04:04] dominictarr: then on every open, open ++
[04:04] dominictarr: on every close, close ++
[04:04] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[04:04] dominictarr: & check if open == close, then close the connection
[04:06] kinane: dominictarr: oh awesome. thanks. in the past i've done similar but used an interval to check....which is silly
[04:06] RORgasm: anyone using Mongoose?
[04:07] kinane: RORgasm: sorry, I'm not. I tried it last summer but preferred mongodb-native
[04:07] dominictarr: actually, i'm working on a new approch for things like this.
[04:07] kinane: dominictarr: ah? yeah? it seems like a pattern that comes up a lot
[04:07] dominictarr: pipe streams of events

[04:16] dominictarr: I just started this yesterday, 
[04:18] dominictarr: but basically you want a hand full of streams, one which recurisvely ls the fs
[04:18] dominictarr: then pipe that into one that reads the files
[04:18] dominictarr: then pipe that into one that saves them.
[04:19] dominictarr: with an abstraction that can take care of when the stream ends etc
[04:20] kinane: dominictarr: whoa. 
[04:20] kinane: i like it a lot.
[04:20] hlindset has joined the channel
[04:20] gazumps has joined the channel
[04:20] dominictarr: so far the code I linked just takes a single async map function and turns it into a stream
[04:21] SubStack: dominictarr: a bit like node-lazy
[04:23] kinane: dominictarr: how would that abstraction work? timeouts?
[04:24] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[04:25] dominictarr: no it just keeps track of the callbacks.
[04:25] dominictarr: it holds off on emitting an end until all maps are finished.

[05:27] statico: aoberoi: whatever datastore you're using, you can key the user information based off of the user id passed back from the FB authentication. in our django app we name users as fb_NNN, where NNN is the FB user id. once the user has been authenticated, stick the user id in your session object, assuming you're using one.
[05:29] rurufufuss_ has joined the channel
[05:29] statico: aoberoi: but if you're asking about how to set up a user table, key off the username, which can be a function of the FB UID.
[05:29] statico: aoberoi: hope that helps. sleeping now.

[10:25] SubStack: pew pew
[10:26] SubStack: FATALITY
[10:26] Orion-: I'm having a hard time understanding js var passing by value or by ref. see this example:
[10:26] Orion-: for(i=0;i<5;i++){(function(){console.log("i = %d", i);})();}
[10:26] Orion-: it outputs as expected 0, 1... etc
[10:26] chjj: right
[10:26] Orion-: But this example:
[10:26] Orion-: a=[]; for(i=0;i<5;i++){a.push(function(){console.log("i = %d", i);});}
[10:26] Orion-: a[1]()
[10:26] Orion-: i = 5
[10:26] SubStack: that is a question about scope not so much about refs
[10:26] chjj: because by the time you execute those functions `i` is 5
[10:26] Orion-: it seems to pass the ref of i to the function
[10:27] chjj: yeah, what substack said
[10:27] chjj: you need to wrap it
[10:27] SubStack: for loops are lame
[10:27] Orion-: teach me please
[10:27] chjj: for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) (function(i) { ... })(i);
[10:27] Orion-: SubStack: just an example it's not a "reallife" example
[10:28] chjj: wrap it in a function like that, and you get to keep the value of `i` when the iteration took place
[10:28] blup: could any of you recommend docs on js patterns?
[10:28] Orion-: chjj: my point is I need to add functions in an array for later run
[10:28] chjj: right, and thats what you do
[10:28] chjj: wrap it in a function
[10:29] Ginlock has joined the channel
[10:29] chjj: most of the time its not a problem, because most people will use Array.prototype.forEach, or underscore's `each` function or something
[10:29] liquidproof has joined the channel
[10:29] chjj: which is already wrapped in a function essentially
[10:29] chjj: but a regular `for` doesnt get to keep its own scope
[10:30] Orion-: chjj: well it's plain js here since I don't use underscore for this part
[10:30] chjj: so you have to make one
[10:30] chjj: i realize that
[10:30] chjj: just do what i showed you, it will work
[10:30] sechrist has joined the channel
[10:30] Orion-: i'm trying to make a queue manager

[10:31] SubStack: function times (n, cb) { for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) cb(i) }
[10:31] chjj: like that
[10:31] chjj: right, or you can make your own little foreach function
[10:31] SubStack: then you can just times(5, function (i) { a.push(function () { console.log('i = ' + i) }) })

[10:48] jhbot has joined the channel
[10:49] Orion-: What's the best way to interract with an SQL server from nodejs ? restful interface ? custom drivers ?
[10:49] DrMcKay: I wonder if my bot is still working, it was behaving really weirdly yesterday
[10:49] mraleph: SubStack: tg ((x - 0.5) * \pi) 
[10:49] DrMcKay: !ping
[10:49] dmkbot: DrMcKay, pong
[10:49] DrMcKay: Orion-: ORM
[10:49] TheJH: nigelb, could you gist the config.js file?
[10:49] SubStack: mraleph: what is tg?
[10:49] mraleph: tan
[10:49] tg: ACTION 
[10:49] nigelb: TheJH: its in the paste as well
[10:49] SubStack: haha
[10:50] TheJH: nigelb, oh, sorry
[10:50] mraleph: in russia it's tg
[10:51] Orion-: DrMcKay: but how would the binding be made ?
[10:51] TheJH: nigelb, does "node config.js" fail?
[10:51] DrMcKay: ACTION is trying to come up with some "In Soviet Russia tg..."
[10:51] nigelb: TheJH: yeah
[10:51] DrMcKay: Orion-: have you tried Mongoose? many ORMs are like it
[10:51] TheJH: nigelb, could you try putting the keys in double quotes?
[10:52] japj: ACTION is stress testing his Synology 211j hardware by compiling node on it
[10:52] Orion-: DrMcKay: I don't know mongoose. I'm having to interract with a mysql server for instance
[10:52] DrMcKay: Orion-: many ORMs do it like: table = Table(Column('name', String), Column('id', Integer)); bind(table, Class) or something similar
[10:53] nigelb: TheJH: hmm, same error. let me try quoting the numbers as well
[10:53] TheJH: nigelb, ah, wait, I know
[10:53] TheJH: nigelb, even "{}" would fail
[10:53] TheJH: nigelb, but "({})" will work
[10:53] nigelb: ah!
[10:54] DrMcKay: Orion-: I used to like node-orm
[10:54] Orion-: DrMcKay: I'm mostly interested on how to connect to a remote dbms either through a restful interface or through a custom drive
[10:54] Orion-: driver
[10:54] TheJH: nigelb, also, you either need "module.exports=" or you have to use JSON.parse and fs.readFileSync
[10:55] DrMcKay: Orion-: RESTful interface? CouchDB is good at it
[10:55] nigelb: TheJH: err, I just installed node. Very new to this.
[10:55] DrMcKay: Orion-: http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/HTTP_Document_API
[10:55] Orion-: DrMcKay: but what's the prefered way in nodejs philosophy ?
[10:56] Orion-: (in order to get more support)
[10:56] DrMcKay: Orion-: well, I don't think there's such philosophy yet. I'm writing my blog engine on MongoDB
[10:56] TheJH: nigelb, ah, ok. I'd suggest just putting valid JSON in your config file and then loading it with JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(__dirname+"/config.js"))
[10:56] DrMcKay: Orion-: but if you want to use SQL, that's cool as well
[10:57] Orion-: Are there any examples of MySQL / nodejs integration ?
[10:57] nigelb: TheJH: oh, ok. let me try :)
[10:57] DrMcKay: Orion-: http://nodejsdb.org/ for example
[10:57] nigelb: TheJH: btw, the application I'm trying to run still fails, with a new failure ;)
[10:58] Orion-: DrMcKay: thanks !
[10:58] DrMcKay: Orion-: :)
[10:59] TheJH: by the way, my bot is on github now: https://github.com/thejh/nodebot

[10:59] TheJH: :D
[10:59] DrMcKay: japj: this thing is running on Linux, right?
[10:59] Orion-: I'll dive again soon into mongodb since I think they added multiple $or and $and support in the engine recently :)
[11:00] japj: DrMcKay: it's an arm device and yes it is running linux
[11:00] japj: DrMcKay: so far it is painfully slow at compiling though, but I don't mind ;)
[11:01] DrMcKay: japj: well, my file server is x86_64 and it's also painfully slow, I know that feeling

[11:05] DrMcKay: TheJH: I was thinking about running it here until you get some sane hosting available
[11:05] Orion-: <dumb-question-mode> If nodejs is so performant because of it's enqueuing at responding to lots of requests, is there no http fully fledged server written in nodes to replace say apache or nginx yet ? </dumb-question-mode>
[11:05] DrMcKay: Orion-: for serving static files?
[11:05] Orion-: DrMcKay: and dynamic also

[11:06] topaxi has joined the channel
[11:06] Orion-: DrMcKay: could be one yes
[11:06] DrMcKay: Orion-: oh. that would be sad...
[11:06] DrMcKay: Orion-: main downside of PHP is it's interpreter, which is painfully slow
[11:07] DrMcKay: Orion-: I doubt anyone can do anything about that
[11:07] Orion-: chjj: I don't know if there is something like a apache or nginx replacement written in nodejs
[11:07] fwg: why would you?
[11:07] Orion-: DrMcKay: javascript is also interpreted if IRC
[11:07] DrMcKay: Orion-: yes, of course
[11:07] fwg: that would be a lot of development time to reach the features 
[11:07] DrMcKay: Orion-: but compare architecture of PHP and v8
[11:08] fdenbow has joined the channel
[11:08] TheJH: DrMcKay, sure, you can do that :)
[11:08] Orion-: fwg: yes I get your point
[11:08] DrMcKay: v8 compiles it code, while PHP is full of Zend-shit
[11:08] TheJH: there is a nodejs server that can run php scripts...
[11:08] DrMcKay: TheJH: OK, I will try to later :)
[11:08] Orion-: Hey I was in "dumb question mode" ! :D

[11:13] Orion-: 4 days is a lot to recall :)
[11:13] DrMcKay: too bad there are not many companies looking for node.js devs
[11:13] Orion-: There will be
[11:14] Orion-: I saw many jobs offers on the nodejs site
[11:14] DrMcKay: Orion-: oh, I lied to you, I've started on August 14
[11:14] DrMcKay: day of my first patch for node.js :D
[11:14] Orion-: huh :D that's changing my vision of the whole world you know ;)
[11:15] DrMcKay: well, not really a patch, just a test
[11:15] DrMcKay: Orion-: :D
[11:15] Orion-: I started node js yesterday
[11:15] Orion-: a whole bunch of hours ago ;)
[11:16] DrMcKay: Orion-: this weird time thing goes so fast, doesn't it?
[11:17] TheJH: DrMcKay, before you try it, be warned that the native dependency thing seems to only work on node 0.4.x (at least that's what I think, not sure)
[11:18] DrMcKay: TheJH: oh. I will try with 0.5 or use nvm
[11:18] TheJH: DrMcKay, ok
[11:18] DrMcKay: TheJH: or compile from source, like a real man
[11:18] TheJH: :D
[11:18] DrMcKay: I think I will iterate through all tags in node and compile all of them
[11:18] Metal3d has joined the channel

[11:21] zpao_ has joined the channel
[11:21] TheJH: DrMcKay, when you checkout e.g. 0.5.3 or so and try to build it, it will fail because the v8 guys decided it would be a good idea to treat unused variables as errors
[11:21] DrMcKay: TheJH: oh, yes, I know, but I thought it's just one version
[11:21] TheJH: DrMcKay, oh, really?

[11:24] Orion-: [13:18] Orion-: DrMcKay: why did you choose to write a blog on nodejs ? Is it an exercise ?

[11:25] DrMcKay: I tend to start with every language by building something useful
[11:25] Orion-: DrMcKay: that's good practice
[11:25] DrMcKay: Orion-: **way** better than reading books
[11:25] TheJH: franck34, there's a room for that, #connect or #express or so, I think
[11:25] DrMcKay: I mean, you google when you have a problem
[11:26] Orion-: DrMcKay: both are useful but practice is very important
[11:26] DrMcKay: you see the solution and see other pieces of code
[11:26] DrMcKay: and, of course, you gain practice :)

[11:30] Orion-: DrMcKay: well no, I work with someone to make a chat service but he already made the service as a http service without any js around, I'm trying to add the js magic and wonder if it would be hard to integrate nodejs in the field to get rid of polling for new messages
[11:31] Orion-: DrMcKay: what's your mother language ?
[11:31] DrMcKay: TheJH: oh, thanks. I just always keep wondering...

[11:35] DrMcKay: chjj: come on, it can't be that good
[11:35] Orion-: DrMcKay: it there an example out there easy to integrate ... my concern is not to include too many js in the html markup .. it's for mobile platforms
[11:36] DrMcKay: Orion-: well, I'm not sure about level of support for websockets on mobile

[11:37] Orion-: Indian people speaking english is also very hard for me to understand
[11:38] DrMcKay: Orion-: yes, I think it's about accent. my father works at polish part of France Telecom and he does teleconferences with asians sometimes
[11:38] Orion-: (no offense again)
[11:38] DrMcKay: Orion-: they actually decided to hire a translator, despite they know english very well

[11:39] TheJH: what do you guys zhink about germans speaking english? terribilh accent? :D
[11:40] Orion-: Not that bad to my experience
[11:40] DrMcKay: TheJH: what Orion- said

[11:59] DrMcKay: Orion-: my pleasure :). bye :)
[11:59] TheJH: DrMcKay, the basic idea tis that you have simple templates (just replace) and complex templates (execute JS that does the replacing)
[11:59] TheJH: *idea is
[12:00] i42n has joined the channel
[12:00] TheJH: and if you parse from end to start, it should even work with nesting :)
[12:00] temp01 has joined the channel
[12:00] DrMcKay: TheJH: oh, ok. this looks more like some functional language
[12:01] TheJH: and functional is cool :)
[12:01] TheJH: it doesn't have to be crazy like erlang, but basically, I like functional stuff :)
[12:02] DrMcKay: TheJH: me too, single map can reduce code from 8 to 1 line
[12:02] DrMcKay: btw, fun fact. Python does optimizations on map reduce and makes them run faster than some loops
[12:02] TheJH: whoah, cool :D
[12:03] DrMcKay: an funnier fact, PyPy evaluates them naivly :<
[12:03] DrMcKay: s/an/and/
[12:04] DrMcKay: btw, is there some multithreading library for node.js?
[12:04] TheJH: DrMcKay, threading?
[12:04] TheJH: DrMcKay, I think you want fibers
[12:04] TheJH: !npm search fiber
[12:04] jhbot: package fiberize: Node API wrapper for use with fibers.
[12:04] jhbot: package fibers-promise: Simple promises for use with fibers.
[12:04] jhbot: package sync: Library that makes simple to run asynchronous functions in synchronous manner, using node-fibers.
[12:05] jhbot: package butler: NodeJS Butler
[12:05] jhbot: package fibers: Cooperative multi-tasking for Javascript; or, the closest thing to a thread you'll see in node
[12:05] SubStack: node is already threaded
[12:05] TheJH: SubStack, but the js isn't multithreaded
[12:05] SubStack: use web workers if you want to crunch some numbers
[12:05] SubStack: or spin off another process
[12:05] DrMcKay: SubStack: I want to define my thread functions myself
[12:05] TheJH: (yes, I don't like fibers, but he asked for it)
[12:05] SubStack: DrMcKay: node is probably not a good environment then
[12:06] Charuru has joined the channel
[12:06] TheJH: DrMcKay, do you want them for number crunching or for less async code?

[12:07] DrMcKay: TheJH: maybe for some node.js bot code execution :D
[12:07] TheJH: DrMcKay, seperate process
[12:07] DrMcKay: TheJH: oh, of course

[12:34] TheJH: DrMcKay, join #freenode, say that you want a cloak for your bot, put a mechanism in your bot to prove that you're its owner, let the bot privmsg a staffer who told you to do it, get your cloak
[12:34] TheJH: that's how I did it
[12:34] DrMcKay: TheJH: TODO ;)

[12:35] TheJH: DrMcKay, login to the bot using nickserv?
[12:36] TheJH: DrMcKay, and then say "I want a botcloak for this account"
[12:36] DrMcKay: TheJH: would work as well

[13:43] tmedema: Is it possible to create a module that stores public references? Eg. var store = require('store'); store.put('io', io'); and then in some other module I want to access socket.io: var io = store.get('io');
[13:44] DrMcKay: tmedema: store.data['io'] = 'io' maybe?
[13:44] DrMcKay: but you can just export put and get functions
[13:44] DrMcKay: oh, but wait, I have to check that
[13:45] tmedema: DrMcKay: that'd work too. I am not really sure whether this isn't bad behavior though
[13:45] tmedema: My reasoning is that I need to access a couple of variables throughout my project. Eg. now.js, or socket.io, or somekind of settings module.
[13:47] jvduf has joined the channel
[13:47] DrMcKay: tmedema: both data and function will fit
[13:47] DrMcKay: with function you get finer degree of control
[13:48] tmedema: DrMcKay: alright, I'll go for the function. But don't you think it's quite bad to have these kind of "global" references?
[13:48] jvduf has joined the channel
[13:48] tmedema: I cannot think of a better solution though, other than passing the variables to each underlying module 
[13:48] DrMcKay: tmedema: node.js does it as well, so why wouldn't you :) ?
[13:49] tmedema: DrMcKay: I guess, not sure really

[14:42] Carter1: where you lift oddly shaped weights
[14:42] DrMcKay: TheJH: so it's something like high school

[14:46] DrMcKay: misterm: idiots?
[14:46] misterm: less apt students?
[14:46] junkee[]: Carter1: Our system is a few hundred of years old so it's also not the best...

[14:47] DrMcKay: Carter1: I'm in vocational school :)
[14:47] Carter1: good for you
[14:48] DrMcKay: Carter1: but it looks way different here

[14:58] tmedema: DrMcKay: that is problematic because it does not give you access to functions in the scope
[14:58] DrMcKay: tmedema: you need closures
[14:59] butu5 has joined the channel
[14:59] tmedema: DrMcKay: closures do give me access to the scope, but they result in "nests"

[15:13] tmedema: With creationx's Step module, the first param is reserved for 'err'; what if a callback already returns err as first parameter? Should it then be: function(err, err2, second) { } ?
[15:15] alindeman: Is this a reasonable way to create a function that gets the data from an array of Redis keys and calls a callback when they are all fetched? Or is there anything more elegant? https://gist.github.com/2b426a8ed9c8d6608a24
[15:15] some1else has joined the channel
[15:16] alindeman: I guess the generic problem is "How to iterate over a list of values, call an async function, and call one callback after all of the other async functions return?
[15:16] chjj: tmedema: it checks whether the function is sync or async by the return value, so it adds an err if it needs one
[15:16] eirikb: alindeman: Object.keys?
[15:17] chjj: tmedema: if the function returns undefined, it assumes you did something async
[15:17] alindeman: eirikb: Can you expound?
[15:17] tmedema: chjj: does it add err only if it is sync ?
[15:18] eirikb: alindeman: Nevermind, it will be similar solution. But since you have callback can't you just callback each key instead?
[15:18] chjj: tmedema: yeah, i think its a bit more complex, but yeah for the most part
[15:18] alindeman: eirikb: Each item in the array will spawn an async function call. I need to call one callback after all the results are finished
[15:18] tmedema: chjj: hmm, for the most part doesn't do it for me ;) he didn't explain this on github, right?
[15:18] chjj: tmedema: hmm, not sure, that was my understanding
[15:18] eirikb: alindeman: Sounds strange, why would it matter that it is async?
[15:19] boaz has joined the channel
[15:19] misterm: alindeman: sounds like something like promises would be good
[15:19] tmedema: chjj: are you using step?
[15:19] snibble has joined the channel
[15:19] alindeman: eirikb: What do you mean?
[15:19] chjj: tmedema: no i dont usually use async control flow helpers, but i have messed around with step
[15:20] tmedema: chjj: hmm, may I ask how you deal with nested closures?
[15:20] ap123 has joined the channel
[15:20] chjj: tmedema: nested closures?
[15:20] eirikb: alindeman: Check comment
[15:20] chjj: tmedema: you mean all the nested callbacks?
[15:20] misterm: chjj: I think they are talking about callback-heavy styles
[15:20] tmedema: chjj: yes
[15:21] chjj: i usually abstract the ugly stuff away into different functions
[15:21] alindeman: eirikb: In this case, it doesn't make sense for another part of execution to proceed until all the keys are fetched
[15:21] oceanspray_: alindeman: usually you can increment a counter each time a redis command is executed, and decrement a counter in the callback. when it's zero all callbacks have been executed. also, with redis the callbakcs are guaranteed to execute in order
[15:21] eirikb: alindeman: Ah
[15:21] pizthewiz has joined the channel
[15:22] chjj: tmedema: people usually say you can of course used named functions for callbacks, i think thats the wrong approach, dont give the callbacks themselves names, abstract the actual async function call, and maybe another one, into its own function
[15:22] alindeman: misterm: Interesting, yah
[15:22] chjj: of course you can use*
[15:22] chjj: tmedema: let me see if i can show you an example of what i mean
[15:23] tmedema: chjj: maybe I should give you an example of my situation and you can magically turn it into a proper case?

[15:24] chjj: tmedema: all i can do is take the code and tell you how i would write it

[15:31] tmedema: chjj: really? I always found 2 spaces too cluttered
[15:31] tmedema: but how would you write normalVersion.js?
[15:32] chjj: tmedema: it kind of looks weird to split this up at all because its a grand total of 15 lines

[15:33] tmedema: chjj: well I made it tiny for you to understand the logic

[15:33] tmedema: chjj: it's not, the comments represent tons of validation logic
[15:33] chjj: could you include that?
[15:33] chjj: it just looks stupid if i have a function with like 3 lines

[15:35] openpercept has joined the channel
[15:39] chjj: tmedema: it depends on what else youre doing with this, i see 3 callbacks here
[15:39] chjj: sitting in one parent function
[15:40] chjj: honestly thats how i would do things, abstract away the ugly stuff into a single function
[15:40] chjj: and use that function elsewhere
[15:40] chjj: ~40 lines, 3 callbacks, is not too unintelligible
[15:40] tmedema: chjj: could you give an example?

[15:41] Frush3 has left the channel
[15:41] tmedema: I will give it a try
[15:41] chjj: if you look at the functions, `Post.get` for example, i abstract away the ugly stuff in one function, to use it in another
[15:42] chjj: sorry, let me see if i can find something else of mine more concise
[15:43] chjj: im not sure, maybe im weird, but im okay with 4 indentation levels a lot of the time
[15:43] chjj: even if theyre just callbacks
[15:44] chjj: if you can look at bits and pieces of my file there, you might see what im talking about
[15:44] tmedema: chjj: I see, well I find it quite hard to read your code, but that is probably because you are doing some complex things
[15:45] tmedema: chjj: basically you'd do something like validateAudioCodecs(mp3, mp4, ogg); instead of doing it inline
[15:45] chjj: no i probably would do it inline
[15:46] chjj: but theres a certain limit, 3 callbacks, im okay with, 4 callbacks, things might change
[15:46] tmedema: chjj: so you don't recommend me to use the step version? I think it looks quite proper. though I have a feeling it significantly reduces performance
[15:47] chjj: it also depends on other things, for example, if you were doing something other than binding events in the connection callback, i would probably move all the event binding out into a separate function called bindEvents
[15:47] chjj: or something along with just binding events*
[15:47] chjj: tmedema: you use whatever youre comfortable with
[15:47] chjj: tmedema: if step works for you, thats great
[15:47] Raynos: Got a general question about forking node.js based libraries

[15:48] luke` has joined the channel
[15:48] tmedema: chjj: using what I am comfortable with has not proven out to be the best strategy in the past ;) For example, I am now stuck with passing my server and client variables to every single module
[15:48] Raynos: I would like to use the "fixed" code now, Is it considered bad practice to add a new npm registery for project + "-fixed" ?
[15:49] chjj: tmedema: if you were writing some kind of standalone library or module, i would say dont increase your dependencies for no reason, but if its an app of yours and you want to use step, go for it
[15:49] chjj: Raynos: probably
[15:50] slajax has joined the channel
[15:50] chjj: Raynos: if its eventually going to be fixed by the module's maintainer, i dont know if its worth adding a package to npm
[15:50] Raynos: chjj: how do you deal with situations where the pull request is not handled and you don't want to use the buggy code? should I include in a lib file?
[15:50] Raynos: lib folder* 
[15:50] chjj: you mean npm-wise?
[15:51] tmedema: chjj: alright, thanks a lot.
[15:51] chjj: well, if you could monkey patch it from the outside to fix the problem, thats what id try first, so you dont have to change the modules code at all

[15:58] albertosheinfeld has joined the channel
[15:58] tmedema: Raynos: but then SocketObject would become one huge object with all kinds of functions that are not related to each other
[15:59] Raynos: tmedema: they should be related to each other :\. There an abstraction on top of a client connecting to your socket. Your basically saying when a client connects, make a new client object for him (or get the existing client object from cache which is code I didnt implement). Then delegate everything else through your client abstraction object
[16:00] azeroth_ has joined the channel
[16:00] tmedema: Raynos: the socket object would have logic for parsing audio capabilities, as well as other events not related to audio ?
[16:01] charleyd has joined the channel
[16:01] Raynos: then your not using the other tools socket.io offers you for seperation of concerns
[16:01] Raynos: I believe it has channels and groups
[16:01] Destos has joined the channel
[16:02] tmedema: Raynos: this channel has a lot of features
[16:02] tmedema: channels are basically groups of people
[16:02] Raynos: It's a way to do it.
[16:02] Raynos: The alternative I would recommend is building a middleware abstraction similar to step.
[16:03] Raynos: And define i/o communication going through a middleware stack rather then using flow control sugar.
[16:03] Raynos: but that still involves including a library so middleware vs step is a personal choice. (I also don't think a generic middleware library exists)

[17:48] TheJH: oh, you are not allowed to because it's the stuff you work with...
[17:48] TheJH: dingomanatee, just to warn you, there are channel logs

[17:56] TheJH: dingomanatee, give me a few seconds...
[17:58] dingomanatee: Thanks TheJH
[17:59] DrMcKay: now, everyone!
[17:59] DrMcKay: no, seriously, listen!
[18:00] DrMcKay: is here anyone who wants to help with non-profit project?
[18:00] dingomanatee: Yes. 
[18:00] tshpaper has joined the channel
[18:00] DrMcKay: it's about disaster relief
[18:00] dingomanatee: Turn it into a for profit startup.
[18:00] DrMcKay: and helping to find missing people
[18:00] TheJH: DrMcKay, what do you have in mind?
[18:00] TheJH: dingomanatee, maybe something like this: https://gist.github.com/e36af7c5f89c7977811c
[18:01] TheJH: dingomanatee, note that this is very abstract code
[18:01] TheJH: dingomanatee, oh, and you'll have to call doSomeWork() at the end
[18:01] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[18:01] DrMcKay: TheJH: what Carter1 will say :)
[18:01] Carter1: Our nonprofit is based on connecting people needs like food, water, shelter with those that have those resources
[18:01] dingomanatee: TheJH thanks.
[18:02] Carter1: helping people find missing people using intelligent forms
[18:02] Carter1: right now there isn't a one spot place where you cna go for this stuff
[18:02] dingomanatee: I'm not trying to be snarky
[18:02] Carter1: so people just go to facebook or local radio stations for help, but the data is not usually shared amongst the volunteers and charities wanting to help
[18:02] dingomanatee: Interesting premise
[18:03] TheJH: Carter1, the thing is, we'd have to make sure that we don't just add anotehr place to the mess
[18:03] TheJH: *another
[18:03] Carter1: TheJH: the goal is, organizations will use our site to manage their resources, volunteers
[18:03] dingomanatee: What resources in this arena are currently being employed?
[18:03] DrMcKay: TheJH: remember when Google hacked out something like that?
[18:03] DrMcKay: TheJH: it was a big success
[18:04] Carter1: we want to augment and help organizations and charities not usurp
[18:04] DrMcKay: TheJH: but they won't do it every time
[18:04] Carter1: so when my city was hit by a massive tornado(35% of the city is destroyed) there were a lot of people wanting to help
[18:04] necrodearia has joined the channel
[18:04] Carter1: but didn't know who to help
[18:05] Carter1: or they needed food and water, but didn't know where to go
[18:05] JKarsrud: where do you set npm dependencies now? is it in the dependencies object in the package.json file, or is it in devDependencies? 
[18:05] dingomanatee: The scale of this sort of undertaking seems like something that a company like Google might be interested in. 
[18:05] DrMcKay: notice that connectivity is the first restored thing
[18:05] Carter1: dingomanatee: its possible that they could, but idk if this is their core competancy
[18:05] Carter1: we could definitely use their services like a commercial version of google maps
[18:05] navaru has joined the channel
[18:06] dingomanatee: maps, people, idunno, sounds very Google to me. 
[18:06] dingomanatee: They are a search engine :D
[18:06] DrMcKay: Carter1: well, I could ping one guy at FB, they could possibly help
[18:06] TheJH: JKarsrud, normal dependencies you need for running the module in "sependencies"
[18:06] Carter1: we definitely want to make it possible to share needs and missing person reports to G+, FB, twitter

[18:07] Carter1: this is our project management page
[18:09] DrMcKay: assembla? I would choose GH, there are more people over there
[18:09] Carter1: DrMcKay: our assembla site is connected to our github repo
[18:09] DrMcKay: oh, ok :)
[18:09] Carter1: :)
[18:09] Carter1: nothing in it yet of course
[18:10] Carter1: GH is great, just doesn't have all of the features that assembla has
[18:10] TheJH: Carter1, https://p.assembla.com/spaces/reliefone/wiki/We_Need_Your_Help redirects me to a login prompt :/
[18:10] Carter1: zoink
[18:10] Carter1: let me fix that
[18:10] TheJH: Carter1, github wikis are visible for everyone :P
[18:11] Carter1: https://p.assembla.com/spaces/relief1/wiki/We_Need_Your_Help
[18:11] TheJH: yup, works now
[18:11] Carter1: i don't see any reason not having the wiki info at both
[18:12] TheJH: Carter1, will you set up an IRC channel for that thing?

[18:21] chjj: that is, after its created
[18:21] chjj: or you can set __proto__ on the constructors prototype to: myconstructor.prototype.__proto__ = EE.prototype;
[18:22] Qbix1: so this won't work? what I did?
[18:22] Qbix1: how abotu this for the constructor: Dispatcher.prototype.__proto__ = events.EventEmitter.prototype;
[18:22] chjj: well it depends on what youre talking about, what is "this"?
[18:23] chjj: yeah, that would work
[18:23] chjj: if Dispatcher is a constructor
[18:23] meandi has joined the channel
[18:23] chjj: the objects it spits out will be EE's
[18:23] chjj: if you need to turn an object into an EE, you can do obj.__proto__ = EE.prototype;
[18:24] chjj: but just having your constructor inherit from EE is better
[18:24] Qbix1: great
[18:24] Qbix1: thanks
[18:25] carmony has joined the channel
[18:25] chjj: Qbixl: just to note though, the standard way to do inheritance is: constructor.prototype = Object.create(parent.prototype);

[18:45] Qbix1: is it the same order in which they are attached? or no?
[18:45] bnoordhuis: ibolmo: compare the output of require('module').globalPaths from the REPL and proc_open
[18:45] blup has joined the channel
[18:45] Qbix1: I just implemented a middleware layer, but not like Connect. I think I did it in a more node-like way
[18:45] Qbix1: Basically you call Q.listen to start a server or return an existing server already running
[18:46] Qbix1: And you can call e.g. Q.Dispatcher.listen(options) to start a server or attach to an existing server already running
[18:46] Qbix1: similarly for any other middleware class
[18:46] Qbix1: they just attach listeners. But I need to know if the listeners will be called in the order they were attached.
[18:46] bnoordhuis: Qbix1: check the events docs, listeners are added to the end of the queue
[18:46] ibolmo: bnoordhuis: did you need me to replace module with less?
[18:46] bnoordhuis: ibolmo: no, 'module' is an actual module :)
[18:46] ibolmo: ha :D
[18:47] ibolmo: in node prompt i'm getting undefined
[18:47] bnoordhuis: ibolmo: what version of node?
[18:47] ibolmo: v0.4.8
[18:47] Qbix1: bnoordhius: so the answer to my question is yes?

[18:56] snowinferno has joined the channel
[18:56] zastaph: first line on https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation in Step3a says to use git clone git://github.com/joyent/node.git if you want to checkout a stable tag
[18:56] zastaph: then 2 lines down it says: git checkout v0.4.11 # optional.  Note that master is unstable.
[18:56] willwhite has joined the channel
[18:56] zastaph: if I already chose the stable above, what do I need the second for?
[18:56] bnoordhuis: ibolmo: yes, you probably need to set up the env properly with proc_open
[18:57] snowinferno: Hi all, i'm getting an error trying to compile node on Fedora 15 x86_64, which version of glibc is required for Node? http://fpaste.org/UBC1/
[18:57] micheil: zastaph: so, the master branch (what you get when you just clone that repository) is unstable and used for development
[18:57] micheil: stable versions are generally even tags, eg, v0.4.11, v0.2.00
[18:58] stalled has joined the channel
[18:58] japj: bnoordhuis: I'll have a new go at compiling it, but it will take ages. I will let you know what the result is
[18:58] micheil: unstable versions tend to be odd tags: v0.5.XX, v0.3.XX
[18:58] zastaph: micheil, ok I think i get it.. so if I want stable I pick last option from line#1 and line#3 too right?
[18:58] bnoordhuis: japj: yes, please do
[18:58] micheil: you will want to do a "git checkout v0.4.11
[18:58] zastaph: thanks
[18:58] bnoordhuis: snowinferno: what version of gcc and binutils are you using?
[18:59] micheil: zastaph: I'm not terribly sure what the git clone --depth 1 thing does there though
[18:59] bnoordhuis: snowinferno: oh, and what arch/archs?
[18:59] snowinferno: bnoordhuis: gcc 4.6.0 and binutils 2.21.51.0.6
[18:59] bnoordhuis: snowinferno: binutils gold or lfd?
[19:00] snowinferno: bnoordhuis: How do i find that out? and i'm on x86_64
[19:00] amerine has joined the channel
[19:00] zastaph: micheil, but the comment of that line is what I'm actually using (to get stable tag as it says)

[19:00] zastaph: without the --depth 1
[19:00] devaholic has joined the channel

[19:01] ibolmo: bnoordhuis: what would  be the environment variable for the npm paths?
[19:01] micheil: zastaph: I personally just have a clone of the full repository, from which I check out tags; so I use: git clone git://github.com/joyent/node.git
[19:01] snowinferno: bnoordhuis: oh, i have binutils package installed
[19:01] ibolmo: does node look that up?
[19:01] snowinferno: checking to see if binutils-gold is an available package, should I need binutils-gold?
[19:01] devrim has joined the channel
[19:02] bnoordhuis: snowinferno: no, binutils-gold has some known bugs
[19:02] bnoordhuis: the versions that most distros ship anyway
[19:02] snowinferno: bnoordhuis: I only see binutils and binutils-devel available
[19:02] bnoordhuis: ibolmo: you can set NODE_PATH
[19:03] ibolmo: bnoordhuis: figured it out
[19:03] ibolmo: need to do npm install -g less
[19:04] bnoordhuis: snowinferno: do you have i386 libs installed?
[19:05] snowinferno: bnoordhuis: I don't think so, is node/v8 32-bit only?
[19:05] snowinferno: ahh, i do see glibc.i686 installed
[19:06] bnoordhuis: snowinferno: having libs installed for multiple archs sometimes confuses the linker
[19:06] micheil: Does anyone know of any really good talks / resources on Streams?
[19:06] bnoordhuis: you probably need to tweak the search path
[19:07] devrim: hi guys, if I fire 30k fs.readFile, am i screwing up my disk? if yes - would u recommend fs.readFileSync ?
[19:07] snowinferno: bnoordhuis: hmm ok. Is that a particularly difficult thing to accomplish?
[19:08] DrMcKay: bnoordhuis: I don't think it has big meaning, I have many i686 libs installed
[19:08] micheil: devrim: fs.readFile and fs.readFileSync use the same stuff under the hood
[19:09] micheil: devrim: given that, your calls well get called serially, in a way
[19:09] bnoordhuis: snowinferno: not really, link by hand and include -L/path/to/proper/dir
[19:09] DrMcKay: snowinferno: but these paths should be /usr/lib64
[19:09] micheil: (the kernel will manage it more-so than you if you use fs.readFile)
[19:10] devrim: micheil: so im not causing impossible to manage I/O request, you're saying i can trust underlying nodejs (i guess v8) mechanics
[19:10] bulatshakirzyano has joined the channel

[19:12] bnoordhuis: snowinferno: just copy the line from the build log and insert -L before the -Wl,dynamic bit
[19:13] jtsnow has joined the channel
[19:13] devrim: one more I/O related question, which one is more I/O friendly? fs.readDir or fs.readFile ? (i know they do diff things, but in my case i can get the same job done using either)
[19:14] devrim: i/o friendly == cheaper
[19:15] micheil: devrim: so, generally, I wouldn't recommend doing 30k requests to the disk, as disk IO is fairly expensive (in comparison to memory)
[19:15] micheil: devrim: what's the problem that you're trying to solve?
[19:16] devrim: micheil: i have 30k apache configs, gotta read and convert to litespeed config file
[19:16] micheil: 30k? bloody hell that's a lot.. :P
[19:16] devrim: i know :)
[19:17] micheil: probably best to devise some form of chunking
[19:17] micheil: also, watch if the disk is heavily fragmented, as it'll take increased time.
[19:17] micheil: that said, it's likely to be a one off task, right?
[19:17] towski has joined the channel
[19:18] micheil: in which case you could put massive waits on disk io, instead of tying yourself up with how to efficiently read all these files
[19:18] mikeycgto has joined the channel
[19:18] mikeycgto has joined the channel
[19:19] devrim: unforutnately i should all those 30k files
[19:19] devrim: if any of them changes, i should rewrite the config
[19:19] devrim: so im going to be replacing some iscsi disks soon im afraid
[19:19] bnoordhuis: devrim: for all 30k files?
[19:19] devrim: *i should watch
[19:19] devrim: yeah
[19:19] devrim: and it's only increasing
[19:20] bnoordhuis: devrim: i'd probably use inotifywait and a perl one-liner :)
[19:20] snowinferno: bnoordhuis: most of the incompatible messages are gone now, but it's complaining about /usr/lib/libz.so being incompatible when searching for -lz
[19:20] devrim: im thinking of replacing that drive with an SSD
[19:21] micheil: yeah, node.js probably isn't the best tool for your job here
[19:21] devrim: because im fairly certain im going to burn it :)
[19:21] micheil: bnoordhuis: I don't suppose you caught my question on streams earlier on, did you?
[19:21] bnoordhuis: snowinferno: do you have a /usr/lib64/libz.so installed?
[19:21] bnoordhuis: micheil: probably not
[19:22] snowinferno: I have a /usr/lib64/libz.so.1
[19:22] devrim: bnoordhuis, any reading advise?
[19:22] snowinferno: bnoordhuis: woops, that's a libzip.so.1
[19:23] bnoordhuis: devrim: inotifywait is in inotify-tools (on debian systems), perl -i -pe 's/foo/bar/g' to update your conf
[19:24] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[19:24] bnoordhuis: devrim: but you should probably turn that one-liner in a proper script :)
[19:24] snowinferno: it seems like there should be something in the configure script to tell it to use /usr/lib64 or /usr/lib
[19:24] micheil: bnoordhuis: okay, the question was just me asking for any resources/opinions people have on Streams.
[19:25] devrim: bnoordhuis, thx! will do some research..

[19:26] bnoordhuis: sorry micheil :)
[19:26] bnoordhuis: can you be specific?
[19:28] micheil: bnoordhuis: I'm working on node-websocket-protocol, however, I'm not sure just how small an event emitter or stream I should break it into
[19:29] micheil: eg, I can go the route of there's just a stream of full message objects
[19:29] losing has joined the channel
[19:29] micheil: or, I can go the route of having a stream of message streams
[19:29] eazyigz: when I use 'exports' and 'require', do the functions in the module that is require'd get executed right away?
[19:30] eazyigz: I mean I am not exporting the functions themselves, but use them in the external module

[19:31] bnoordhuis: micheil: i don't know the current websockets draft that well but that's never stopped me before from having an opinion
[19:31] bnoordhuis: micheil: i'd probably write it as an event emitter that emits messages
[19:31] bnoordhuis: unless you're going to do big streaming things
[19:31] micheil: okay, well, that's the thing
[19:31] micheil: in the latest websocket draft, there's the ability to split messages into chunks
[19:31] micheil: (continuation frames)

[20:12] heated has joined the channel
[20:13] TheJH: mcepl, node should use its own v8 version
[20:13] heated: Hi I'm new to node.js and I was directed here from the end of the Beginners tutorial online.
[20:13] mcepl: does it have to?
[20:14] mcepl: TheJH: this is Fedora so no bundled libraries are allowed
[20:14] mcepl: if I cannot have node.js w/o bundled v8, there is no node.js for Fedora.
[20:14] TheJH: mcepl, ah, you're trying to make a fedora package?
[20:14] mcepl: yes
[20:14] MrWarGames has joined the channel
[20:14] mcepl: update Fedora package
[20:14] TheJH: mcepl, nodejs doesn't alter the included v8
[20:14] TheJH: mcepl, so if the v8 version matches, it should work
[20:15] TheJH: heated, hello :)
[20:15] heated: How can I learn more about node.js?
[20:15] mcepl: sorry, I was wrong ... my question was about building v8, not node.js. Actually ... more if there is anybody who nows anything about scons (I don't)
[20:15] mcepl: *knows
[20:15] bnoordhuis: mcepl: what's the issue?

[20:17] bnoordhuis: mcepl: this is a problem with v8, right?
[20:17] mcepl: bnoordhuis: yes, sorry
[20:17] mcepl: should I just go to #v8?
[20:17] mcepl: or would somebody be able to help me here?
[20:18] bnoordhuis: mcepl: well... are there actual people in #v8?
[20:18] bsstoner has left the channel
[20:18] mcepl: not many .. 25
[20:18] mcepl: and how many of them bots I don't know
[20:18] bnoordhuis: mcepl: it's probably easiest to patch the SConstruct file
[20:19] bnoordhuis: mcepl: i take it you're trying to roll a .rpm?
[20:19] mcepl: yes
[20:19] mcepl: actually, push it to Fedora repos even (if I manage to build it, that is)
[20:19] mcepl: trying to fix https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=732213
[20:19] bnoordhuis: mcepl: will one or two small out-of-tree patches hurt?
[20:20] mcepl: no
[20:20] mcepl: we already have some patches (https://gitorious.org/various-small-stuff/fedora-v8/trees/master)
[20:20] ttpva has joined the channel
[20:21] bnoordhuis: mcepl: look for D8_FLAGS in SConstruct

[20:21] bnoordhuis: or the general LINKFLAGS
[20:22] mcepl: I see D8_FLAGS
[20:22] bnoordhuis: i think d8 is actually the only thing that links to libv8
[20:22] bnoordhuis: so patch the LIBS setting and you should be good to go
[20:22] chjj: fedora v8?
[20:22] mcepl: so instead of LIBS: ['v8'] there should be something else?
[20:22] chjj: whats wrong with fedora on v8? :O
[20:22] bnoordhuis: mcepl: yes
[20:22] chjj: or
[20:22] chjj: v8 on fedora*
[20:23] mcepl: bnoordhuis: could I make it somehow automagically versioned?
[20:23] mcepl: chjj: there is only very old one in repos
[20:23] chjj: i see
[20:23] bnoordhuis: mcepl: search for GetVersionComponents
[20:23] chjj: ive never used fedora, i kind of want to try it
[20:23] bnoordhuis: but i'm not 100% sure everything's been defined at that point
[20:24] zentropa24 has left the channel

[20:50] Nuck: no.de and some others provide awesome node servers for free, plus there's sites that offer things like $1 VPSes.
[20:50] japj: bnoordhuis: there is a --armeabi setting for SConstruct that defaults to softfp, so I think it isn't detected by the v8 build environment by default
[20:51] japj: bnoordhuis: is there a way to force settings to v8 SConstruct from the configure or make environment?
[20:51] japj: bnoordhuis: I mean from node's make environment
[20:51] bnoordhuis: japj: CXXFLAGS?
[20:52] heated: no.de requires some weird coupon stuff
[20:52] bnoordhuis: heated: you mean the curl thing?
[20:52] japj: bnoordhuis: no, I need to add --armeabi settings to whevere node is calling into the v8 SConstruct file

[20:52] bnoordhuis: japj: oh, i don't think you can right now

[22:12] japj: bnoordhuis: it's a Synology DS211j arm thing
[22:12] japj: ahm.. how can I tell the glibc version?
[22:12] bnoordhuis: japj: what distro in any does it have installed?
[22:13] schwab: whats poping
[22:13] japj: it is an Synology DS211j, I think it's probably a custom distribution of sorts
[22:13] japj: libc.so.6 is present

[22:16] japj: anyway, that explains then
[22:16] bnoordhuis: japj: we all have our faults
[22:16] japj: ;)
[22:16] bnoordhuis: it's pretty easy to fix
[22:17] bnoordhuis: look for config_linux.h in deps/uv
[22:17] bnoordhuis: there are two, one for libev and one for libeio
[22:17] bnoordhuis: set the HAVE_EVENTFD and HAVE_SIGNALFD #defines to 0, recompile, done

[22:27] mraleph has joined the channel
[22:27] dscape: ok bnoordhuis , let me try that
[22:27] dscape: however this is from the node docs
[22:27] bnoordhuis: japj: i'll add some checks to libuv
[22:28] bnoordhuis: dscape: yeah, it's a bug in node - i've been fixing it but it's not entirely solved
[22:28] bnoordhuis: dscape: it should work (mostly?) in 0.4.11
[22:28] dscape: im on 0.4.8
[22:28] bnoordhuis: there you go :)
[22:28] dscape: looking forward to 0.5 but express doesnt support it yet so have to wait for a while
[22:29] dscape: well if you need a test case
[22:29] dscape: you got one there :)
[22:29] dscape: bnoordhuis: is there any place where I can track the bug? This is quite central to what im building

[22:30] bnoordhuis: else just read the commit logs :)
[22:31] dscape: thanks bnoordhuis :)
[22:31] japj: bnoordhuis: [05:55|% 100|+ 248|-   1]: Done, test/simple/test-regress-GH-892.js did a timeout
[22:32] bnoordhuis: japj: GH-892 is a troublesome one
[22:32] bnoordhuis: i'm actually pleasantly surprised that it's the only failing one
[22:32] japj: bnoordhuis: yep, I know.. the rest seems to go ok ;)
[22:32] japj: bnoordhuis: don't know how long the tests take on a 'normal' system though
[22:33] bnoordhuis: japj: depends how fast your system is
[22:33] bnoordhuis: japj: on my laptop it's 1-2 minutes
[22:33] japj: bnoordhuis: this one has BogoMIPS        : 1192.75

[22:47] bnoordhuis: dscape: you need either 0.4.11 or the current master
[22:48] dscape: bnoordhuis: don't have xcode in this computer unfortunately so I can only get those pkg files that are on the internet  :\ 0.4.11 isnt there yet
[22:49] dscape: actually theres no xcode for snow leopard in the app sore anymore...
[22:49] dscape: lets boot up a vm
[22:49] bnoordhuis: dscape: doesn't os x come with gcc preinstalled? gcc, make and python is what you need
[22:50] dscape: bnoordhuis: no
[22:50] dscape: worse, it forces you to install 3GB to get gcc and make!!

[23:12] isufy has left the channel
[23:13] dscape: bnoordhuis: works fine in 0.5.5-pre
[23:13] dscape: bottom line, wait for 0.5 to hit stable
[23:14] dscape: and then wait for express to catcjh up
[23:14] bnoordhuis: dscape: or 0.4.12 - though i thought that fix went into 0.4.11
[23:15] dscape: bnoordhuis: i tried that gist, didnt work on 0.4.11
[23:15] dscape: want me to open a issue?
[23:15] bnoordhuis: dscape: does it also fail with the HEAD of the v0.4 branch?
[23:15] dscape: bnoordhuis: let me try that
[23:15] dscape: need to recompile
[23:15] isufy has joined the channel
