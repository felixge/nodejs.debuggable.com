[05:00] Advant: I'm confused on what is best/common practice.  Should nodejs be serving html content, or better to use apache to serve content and use nodejs as an application server layer?
[05:01] Aria: Both are common, neither is best. Apache is a huge beast in a lot of ways.
[05:01] Aria: Node can also do things that Apache can't, and can't do a lot of them if it's stuck being proxied to.
[05:03] kazupon has joined the channel
[05:06] Advant: Aria: what would be a good google phrase and just using apache?  One example I saw showed content being read from disk each time it was served
[05:06] Advant: I mean just using node
[05:07] AAA_awright: Or just use Nginx
[05:07] Aria: Not sure. Apache's just ... heavy. A full thread for every request. Bad enough for short requests. It's quite a lot of overhead for a long-running mostly-idle one.
[05:07] AAA_awright: Nginx 1.1 can serve static content, proxy Socket.io streams, and load-balance between a Node.js process per core
[05:07] AAA_awright: And it's evented like Node.js is, bonus
[05:08] slloyd_air has joined the channel
[05:08] Aria: Yeah. nginx is a better front server than apache.
[05:08] Aria: I myself run node exposed when I can.
[05:09] Advant: I misspoke, I meant examples of serving content with only nodejs
[05:09] Advant: I want to setup a simple app with knockoutjs and have node serve my content for me
[05:09] Aria: Oh. You can use static file middleware.
[05:10] Advant: Aria: would express be an example of that?
[05:11] Aria: No. Express is routing and template rendering.
[05:11] Aria: But connect includes such middleware.
[05:11] Aria: (and connect is the lower layers of express)
[05:11] Advant: Ah ok

[07:15] jbrokc has joined the channel
[07:15] DTrejo_: had an error at the end
[07:15] DTrejo_: didn't finish
[07:16] bnoordhuis: DTrejo_: can you try `JOBS=1 make -j 1`?
[07:16] DTrejo_: oh hmm
[07:16] DTrejo_: just redid it with that
[07:16] DTrejo_: will paste output
[07:17] DTrejo_: bnoordhuis: added another file
[07:17] DTrejo_: see the gist
[07:18] DTrejo_: (should show at top)
[07:18] DTrejo_: I think it finished
[07:18] DTrejo_: got this though /usr/include/AvailabilityMacros.h:108:14: warning: #warning Building for Intel with Mac OS X Deployment Target < 10.4 is invalid.
[07:18] DTrejo_: wait that doesn't matter
[07:18] DTrejo_: nvm
[07:19] bnoordhuis: DTrejo: Parallel Jobs: 4 <- it's still doing a parallel build
[07:19] DTrejo_: well, make all by itself works
[07:19] DTrejo_: parallel had an issue
[07:19] DTrejo_: o well
[07:19] bnoordhuis: there's a race in the interaction between waf and make that makes it fail sometimes :/
[07:19] DTrejo_: oh let me make test
[07:20] ayaz has joined the channel
[07:20] bnoordhuis: DTrejo_: can you do `./configure --debug && make && make test-all`?

[07:30] AvianFlu: bnoordhuis, ryah, got one that failed: https://gist.github.com/1341235
[07:30] bnoordhuis: DTrejo_: can you run it like this: `JOBS=1 make -j 1`? that forces waf and make to do a linear build
[07:31] DTrejo_: k

[07:43] bnoordhuis: DTrejo_: wow
[07:43] bnoordhuis: and also, wtf?
[07:43] DTrejo_: my setup is probably wierd
[07:43] DTrejo_: output by this: ./configure --debug >> out.log && JOBS=1 make -j 1 >> out.log && make test-all >> out.log
[07:43] bnoordhuis: any chance you can hook up a test to gdb and see where it crashes?
[07:43] DTrejo_: hmm
[07:44] DTrejo_: haven't really used gdb much
[07:44] bnoordhuis: gdb --args out/Debug/node test/simple/test-assert.js
[07:44] bnoordhuis: then `r` for run, `bt` for the backtrace
[07:44] DTrejo_: just ran that commant
[07:44] DTrejo_: command
[07:44] DTrejo_: should I press r until something breaks?
[07:45] bnoordhuis: DTrejo_: no, it's just to start node
[07:45] bnoordhuis: `bt` is for when it crashed
[07:45] DTrejo_: https://gist.github.com/1341249
[07:46] DTrejo_: just posted the bt

[07:47] bnoordhuis: indutny is testing on 10.6.8 as well and he doesn't have that issue
[07:48] DTrejo_: hmm
[07:48] DTrejo_: i use mac ports
[07:48] DTrejo_: shouldnt affect anything tho?

[07:50] bnoordhuis: DTrejo_: what does `gcc -v` look like for you?

[08:20] piscisaureus_ has joined the channel
[08:21] borlo: can someone help me out here... i'm trying to "browserify" a node.js irc client (npm install irc)... i got fairly close i think, but it still requires "net" and i can't figure out how to get it to include all of it
[08:21] DTrejo_: borlo: can't get around net w/out a server-side component
[08:21] DTrejo_: it's core
[08:21] TheJH: borlo, you can't do that without a nodejs server that takes care of doing the actual irc connection
[08:22] borlo: hmm
[08:22] TheJH: borlo, you could create a fake net module that redirects stuff over a socket.io connection or so
[08:22] borlo: no way to remove the middle man, eh?  can't "browserify" the "irc" module?
[08:22] plutoniix has joined the channel
[08:23] borlo: yeah i guess i was hoping someone would've already done that by now :)
[08:23] jbrokc_ has joined the channel
[08:23] DTrejo_: borlo: you could be the first
[08:23] DTrejo_: could be simple
[08:23] DTrejo_: net-client
[08:23] DTrejo_: net-server
[08:24] TheJH: but that'd require much trust into the clients
[08:24] TheJH: such a generic module
[08:24] DTrejo_: trueee
[08:24] TheJH: after all, it's basically an open proxy
[08:25] AAA_awright: browserify?
[08:25] TheJH: that allows you to do even more than just web
[08:25] TheJH: AAA_awright, browserified net module with a helper in node
[08:27] AAA_awright: borlo: Just have martynsmith/node-irc on the server side, send the parsed messages with socket.io
[08:27] DTrejo_: TheJH: what if they had to auth first...then you can trust a bit more, a tiny bit more
[08:27] AAA_awright: Which IRC module are you using exactly?
[08:28] rendar has joined the channel
[08:28] TheJH: DTrejo, mhm, yes
[08:28] TheJH: DTrejo, and you could also restrict stuff on the server side...
[08:28] TheJH: mhmmmh...
[08:28] borlo: aaa_awright, yes that's what i'm doing
[08:29] borlo: but it would be nice to remove the middle man
[08:29] AAA_awright: It's hard to do. You end up having to parse the IRC packets and by that point you may as well do it all server side
[08:29] borlo: and have the client connect directly to the irc server
[08:29] borlo: half the overhead
[08:29] AAA_awright: borlo: Well then what do you need Node.js for? :p Flash can do that, I think
[08:29] AAA_awright: Which strikes me as dangerous
[08:29] TheJH: AAA_awright, I'm sure it can't
[08:30] alessioalex has joined the channel
[08:30] AAA_awright: I'm pretty sure it can at least handle UDP packets

[08:31] AAA_awright: TheJH: I think it's going to look for crossdomain.xml

[08:31] alessioalex: hey peeps
[08:32] TheJH: AAA_awright, and no irc server would offer one
[08:32] AAA_awright: I think there's Java applets that can too
[08:33] AAA_awright: Somehow they can connect directly to IRC servers, last I checked

[12:45] einaros: garrensmith: well the thing is that I'm working to complete the binary support for the various transports in socket.io. to do that I need a better websocket client than we've already used, as the current one only supports the old hixi protocol

[15:18] b_i_d: kai_ : I don't know the answer, so don't give a shit about this. But my first ideas where: 1) open bash or so and send the commands to it. 2) Try out TTY instead of child_process

[20:37] swaj: or does it only change when it's popped?

[20:41] swaj: and once I hooked in redis, the session store applied accross all processes, and wasn't unique

[22:58] JakeSays: i want to use the Canvas module with it
[22:59] TheJH: weeeelll... actually, there's a pretty annoying bug that causes it to randomly crash from time to time
[22:59] c4milo has joined the channel
[22:59] TheJH: it's in libuv if I remember correctly
[22:59] JakeSays: hmm.
[23:00] Aria: You're gonna have to see if it works for your uses, honestly. It's good software. But rapidly developing.
[23:01] JakeSays: i wonder if node-canvas runs
[23:01] paul__: i have an https express server with now.js initialized on it.. sometimes (usually) on the client i get "WebSocket network error: OSStatus Error -9812: valid cert chain, untrusted root" - is there a way i can get now's socket.io to ignore the certs or do i have to buy valid ones?
[23:02] paul__: or disable https..?
[23:02] JakeSays: oh interesting - node.js in iis
[23:03] Aria: Yeah!
