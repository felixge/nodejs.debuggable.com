[01:31] Nexxy: mikegerwitz: my point is why pdf would be the first choice for a document that (as far as I can tell) is just going to be printed and dumped
[01:32] mikegerwitz: Nexxy: It's not my first choice. But phantomjs is the perfect use case for rendering a HTML page in a headless environment. If it has output formats besides PDF that'd be preferred, but I've only seen coworkers use it. NEver have myself
[01:33] chjj: pdf is...an unfortunate format to be using, i would use nearly anything before going near pdf
[01:33] Nexxy: ^ basically this ;3
[01:33] Nexxy: especially with how troubled pdf and cupsd relationship seems to be
[01:33] chjj: now that we have data URIs, why not have a single self-contained HTML file as a document format? no need for pdf!
[01:33] Nexxy: in the past anyway, it may not be that way now

[01:56] mikegerwitz: eguest: The phantomjs suggestion was my quick idea ;) I have never had to deal with what you are doing. The problem is, it sounds like you need to render HTML like you would with a browser. PhantomJS uses WebKit, which is as close to a browser as you're going to get. Other solutions that simply "print html" will likely not produce exactly what you're looking for

[02:31] ryah: e2i: the wiki is publically editable
[02:32] e2i: Sure, but as it is it's not really answering simple questions (I'm very new to node)

[02:54] jmoyers: ah
[02:54] marcello3d: this is more like: "I have 20 parts of my code that might need to read this file"
[02:54] marcello3d: so I make a taxman with a function for reading the file
[02:54] marcello3d: and the 20 parts would use the taxman
[02:54] jmoyers: yeah, i get it -- i've never seen that done myself
[02:55] marcello3d: I'm using it in my codebase to retrieve the user's session from the database
[02:55] marcello3d: I tack on a taxman onto my req object
[02:55] marcello3d: but for routes that don't even care about the user, it never gets called
[02:56] marcello3d: also going to use it in mongolian deadbeef for connection management
[02:56] jmoyers: only problem is that keeping that in memory means an ever expanding footprint eh
[02:56] marcello3d: well no, it's tied to the request
[02:56] marcello3d: once the request is garbage collected, it goes away

[04:28] Andre_Turrettini: but I'm not getting any messages sent from there.
[04:29] Andre_Turrettini: tho, I can see a client.log message like I expect.

[04:44] jacobolus: er, /usr/bin
[04:44] hoho: Can anyone answer why big open source projects have moved to github.com?
[04:44] jacobolus: instead of /usr/local/bin
[04:45] mikey_p: hoho: it works?
[04:45] jacobolus: I mean, I just installed from source, so it was no big deal, but still kind of annoying
[04:45] mikey_p: hoho: also gives a good way for other contributor to get involved by signing up and forking
[04:45] jacobolus: hoho: because it makes collaboration substantially easier than whateve they were doing before?
[04:45] hoho: mikey_p: better than the others? like, source forge?
[04:45] flippyhead has joined the channel
[04:45] mikey_p: vastly
[04:45] jacobolus: oh god, source forge is awful
[04:45] mikey_p: the ads, the download redirects
[04:46] jacobolus: the inability to browse code
[04:46] jacobolus: the difficulty submitting patches
[04:46] mikey_p: and 10,000 more items
[04:46] chjj: ah, sourceforge is the worst for browsing code
[04:46] mikey_p: github has seriously revolutionized how people think about contributing to open source
[04:46] hoho: lol nobody seems to like source forge
[04:46] hoho: mikey_p: how so? could you be more specific?
[04:47] mikey_p: I helped the Drupal community convert their project hosting system to git, over 8000 repos, and the first thing everyone wanted to do was fork and issue pull requests
[04:47] chjj: another thing that bugs me, is that sourceforge flatout doesnt work with JS disabled, that might bug other people less though
[04:47] Andre_Turrettini: true, sourceforge got swatted from sight when github came on. 
[04:48] jacobolus: ryah: so is the recommendation to just install node in my home directory someplace?
[04:48] mikey_p: bitbucket is probably the only thing that i've seen that's close to github, and it's hg only
[04:48] pyrotechnick1: ryah: if i fork node.js at every commit and offer consulting services of that fork, is that okay?
[04:48] mikey_p: pyrotechnick1: watch out for the trademark?
[04:48] pyrotechnick1: a fork under a different name
[04:49] mape: pyrotechnick1: why not use the main one and not use node.js in the name of the service?
[04:49] pyrotechnick1: its not just the name of the service
[04:49] pyrotechnick1: http://blog.nodejs.org/2011/04/29/trademark/
[04:49] pyrotechnick1: you cant refer to node
[04:49] pyrotechnick1: without written consent
[04:49] pyrotechnick1: everyone already is
[04:49] pyrotechnick1: but it's not fly with joyent
[04:49] mape: pyrotechnick1: Then don't? You still don't have to fork
[04:50] ryah: pyrotechnick1: if you don't call it "node.js", yes
[04:50] pyrotechnick1: that's what i thought
[04:50] hoho: doing research on this online collaboration sites and your comments would greatly help.. thanks
[04:51] hoho: so node.js was originally being done somewhere else and moved to github, is that right?
[04:51] jacobolus: hoho: if you want a project with a long history of open collaboration, look at python
[04:51] ryah: hoho: no, it started on github
[04:53] ryah: pyrotechnick1: the goal is not to prevent you from offering consulting services - just to prevent random people from appearing to be "official"
[04:53] fr0stbyte has joined the channel
[04:53] pyrotechnick1: yeah nah i fully agree with it
[04:53] hoho: jacobolus: could you kindly name a psython project you think appropriate?

[04:53] pyrotechnick1: i'm just running it by the legal team here and they had this question for some reason or another, they're explaining to me now
[04:53] hoho: sorry typed it wrong
[04:53] jacobolus: hoho: see python.org, comp.lang.python, etc.

[04:55] Andre_Turrettini: Ok, so my question - easier to read - http://pastebin.com/S3SbKDjP - the why o why string?
[04:56] marcello3d: Andre_Turrettini: probably because client.on('connect') never fires
[04:56] pyrotechnick1: ryah: do you imagine if i were to compete with Joyent i would be granted permission to use the trademark without being "friends" of the owners?
[04:57] marcello3d: Andre_Turrettini: you're already connected at that point, there's no further "connection" that can happen

[04:58] Andre_Turrettini: marcello3d, pyrotechnick1, yup, I'm getting that, but why is'nt it working right after the socket.on('connection'...
[04:58] pyrotechnick1: I know what you're trying to achieve with all this but i must admit i'm a little disenchanted with the implementation. this comment summarises my thoughts well http://blog.nodejs.org/2011/04/29/trademark/#comment-158
[04:58] marcello3d: Andre_Turrettini: that should work :)
[04:59] liquidproof has joined the channel
[04:59] pyrotechnick1: I'm questioning the whether the price Joyent paid for node was high enough
[05:00] pyrotechnick1: i mean they hired you, isaacs and a few others. are you guys really on all that much? was it worth it?
[05:00] pyrotechnick1: for the cost of a few devs they now own node.js for all intents and purposes
[05:01] marcello3d: pyrotechnick1&ryah: if the node trademark is really like the apache one, that quote from your link definitely doesn't seem to match up
[05:01] ryah: They formally bought the copyright from me.
[05:01] wao: mm
[05:01] marcello3d: do you have to get a license from the apache foundation to be a webhost that runs apache software?
[05:02] marcello3d: or to be a webhost that says you use Apache technology
[05:02] rmustacc: The former is fine marcello3d
[05:02] ryah: marcello3d: the trademark is only about use of the name - not the software
[05:02] brianmario has joined the channel
[05:02] chjj: i dont see many hosts called "apache-host" though
[05:02] mjr_ has joined the channel
[05:03] rmustacc: The latter comes down to whether or not you fall into the equivalent of fair use under trademark law.
[05:03] Andre_Turrettini: Oyy! it does work.  Tks marcello3d.  I just needed to interact to fix my reality.
[05:03] marcello3d: where does a tag line come into play?
[05:03] mattstevens has joined the channel
[05:03] jacobolus: no one has an idea why I can `require('underscore')` from a shell, but can't require a module which itself does `require('underscore')` without getting an error thrown up?
[05:03] marcello3d: if I say I'm "uberhost: a great place to host your node.js apps" does that need a license?
[05:03] marcello3d: or "uberhost: we use node.js to run your websites fast"
[05:04] chjj: i think ryah just said, it only concerns the name
[05:04] marcello3d: (swap out node.js with apache or apache tomcat)
[05:04] pyrotechnick1: As Ryan mentions in his post, the only change for members of the community is that the contributor agreement will be directed to Joyent rather than to Ryan. Otherwise, it’s business as usual for Node developers.
[05:04] pyrotechnick1: what happened to that?
[05:05] pyrotechnick1: this is what concerns me… you can play it off as much as you like but that's lie #1
[05:05] ryah: http://nodejs.org/cla.html
[05:05] hoho: mikey_p: you said github has revolutionized people's way of thinking regarding oss participation, is that because github allows fork?

[05:06] mikey_p: pyrotechnick1: the github method of forking for collaboration is different use case

[05:11] pyrotechnick1: node's growing up too quickly :(
[05:11] pyrotechnick1: well i mean marcello3d if you're a good noder and follow joyents suggestions
[05:11] pyrotechnick1: then you would need
[05:11] sorens3n: btw, thank you ever so much for developing such a wonderful technology for me to work in.
[05:11] sorens3n: @ryan
[05:11] marcello3d: pyrotechnick1: I don't put node.js anywhere
[05:11] pyrotechnick1: Node.js is an official trademark of Joyent. This [module, event, etc.] is not formally related to or endorsed by the official Joyent Node.js open source or commercial project.
[05:12] pyrotechnick1: but i bet you dont
[05:12] pyrotechnick1: i bet nobody does
[05:12] pyrotechnick1: and nobody wants to
[05:12] pyrotechnick1: so why ask people to
[05:12] brownies: o.O they trademarked it? they can do that?
[05:12] marcello3d: pyrotechnick1: no I mean I don't mention the name node.js in my projects
[05:12] sorens3n: marcello3d: neither do i
[05:12] marcello3d: brownies: anyone can trademark anything
[05:12] pyrotechnick1: do you list it on the node modules page?
[05:13] marcello3d: yes
[05:13] pyrotechnick1: so you're affiliating your project with node nonetheless?
[05:13] pyrotechnick1: do you put node in your npm package as an engine?
[05:13] marcello3d: yep
[05:13] nexxy: I thought all the trademark bitching was done with 3 days ago ;o
[05:13] pyrotechnick1: do you see where i'm going with this?
[05:13] pyrotechnick1: you're affiliating yourself in many ways
[05:13] sorens3n: nexxy: me too
[05:13] mikey_p: here's one of the best open source trademark policies i've ever seen: http://drupal.com/trademark
[05:13] pyrotechnick1: without following joyents new guidelines
[05:13] marcello3d: shrug
[05:13] marcello3d: that's not my problem
[05:13] marcello3d: that's npm/node wiki's problem
[05:13] pyrotechnick1: i'm afraid, you're mistaken
[05:13] marcello3d: not at all
[05:13] mikey_p: it only restricts commercial usage, vs. community usage is encouraged
[05:14] pyrotechnick1: you have not followed the trademark owner's instructions
[05:14] marcello3d: I'm not using the trademark
[05:14] rmustacc: He's not using the mark.
[05:14] pyrotechnick1: you're violating their agreement with you
[05:14] sorens3n: i think ryan is hesitant on posting in here for fear of assault :P
[05:14] marcello3d: how am I violating their trademark agreement if I'm not using their trademark?
[05:14] pyrotechnick1: trademark isnt about using the word "node.js" it's about affiliation
[05:14] Wa: sounds like saying "this software works with node.js" is ok considering the nominative/non-trademark use section
[05:14] Wa: considering it's factual
[05:14] rmustacc: It's about using the name to apply affiliation actually.
[05:14] pyrotechnick1: same reason why google cant say "googling"
[05:15] rmustacc: *name to imply
[05:15] marcello3d: pyrotechnick1: they're legally required to make an effort to defend their trademark or they're lose it
[05:15] marcello3d: they aren't legally required to sue anyone
[05:15] sorens3n: good point
[05:15] chjj: when did this channel suddenly become #legalese?
[05:15] Rodtusker has joined the channel
[05:15] pyrotechnick1: when joyent decided to bring in the lawyers
[05:15] sorens3n: when legalese started talking about node.js

[05:15] sorens3n: ;)
[05:15] marcello3d: until then, party hard!
[05:15] Wa: I don't even know what nominative means, that's just the title of the section
[05:16] Wa: lol
[05:16] marcello3d: I mean

[05:16] shanez has joined the channel
[05:16] marcello3d: if they start suing their own customers
[05:17] marcello3d: they'll lose all their customers and go out of business

[05:21] pyrotechnick1: good intentions, bad execution
[05:21] nexxy: pyrotechnick1, then I guess we all have a big schism/fork to look forward to

[05:23] nexxy: mariaDB
[05:23] pyrotechnick1: there's been no name change or anything of the sort :p
[05:24] nexxy: mariadb is a fork of mysql
[05:24] pyrotechnick1: wtf
[05:24] nexxy: built by the original authors of mysql
[05:24] pyrotechnick1: it happened!
[05:24] nexxy: derp.
[05:24] Wa: http://mariadb.org/
[05:24] chjj: so is it mysql, except good?
[05:24] nexxy: it's mysql w/o oracle
[05:24] nexxy: so, yes.
[05:24] mape: Guess they are buying http://nodejs.com/ then :P
[05:25] mape: Guy that bought it wanted 6k for it
[05:25] mbrevoort: pyrotechnick1 raises good points. The Java/Oracle problem seemingly started when Oracle bought Sun, but it was the copyright and ownership details that enabled the problem in the 1st place

[08:04] enzo: hum, node.js is a framework based on V8, but you know other frameworks based on V8 ?
[08:04] cachemoney: damn hookah is cheap in oregon

[08:04] pyrotechnick: enzo: i think narwhal can run directly on it
[08:05] pyrotechnick: but it can also run on node so go figure

[08:05] eldios has joined the channel
[08:06] cachemoney: yup
[08:06] enzo: I'm wondering, as node.js is using V8, maybe V8 will evolve to achieve by default what node.js can achieve no ?

[08:06] cachemoney: i think node runs on Spider too
[08:06] pyrotechnick: never
[08:06] pyrotechnick: enzo: there's too much in node that v8 doesn't have to do
[08:07] enzo: never is for my question pyrotechnick ? why are you sure about this ?
[08:07] pyrotechnick: v8's bulky enough as it is
[08:07] chapel: cachemoney: it doesn't run on spider yet
[08:07] cachemoney: V8 = javascript engine. node = framework that runs on that engine.
[08:07] chapel: there are people making v8's bindings to spidermonkey
[08:07] chapel: so that you can use spider in place of v8
[08:07] markwubben has joined the channel
[08:07] chapel: though I don't think its worth it
[08:07] pyrotechnick: i'm not sure i'd call node a framework
[08:07] cachemoney: chapel: https://github.com/zpao/spidernode
[08:07] chapel: node is more akin to a vm
[08:07] enzo: ok
[08:07] chapel: cachemoney: I know
[08:07] cachemoney: though i haven't tried it, i thought that works
[08:07] enzo: and node.js can run on spidermonkey ?
[08:08] pyrotechnick: soon it will
[08:08] pyrotechnick: they're working on it ^^
[08:08] pyrotechnick: thats the project
[08:08] enzo: ok
[08:08] pyrotechnick: they're doing it a funky way though
[08:08] pyrotechnick: instead of porting node to monkey
[08:08] chapel: but I hope it dies :P
[08:08] pyrotechnick: they're porting monkey to v8
[08:08] hoho: @ryah: how can u manage irc, googlegroups, stack overflow and else at once??
[08:08] cachemoney: isn't V8 GC superior to spider?
[08:08] pyrotechnick: that's debatable
[08:08] chapel: or has no effect on 3rd party code
[08:08] pyrotechnick: generally, speed-wise, v8 is a little faster
[08:09] pyrotechnick: but they all are awesome at something
[08:09] chapel: I just worry that with a fork like this, that my code, or anyones code, wont reliably work on both versions
[08:09] pyrotechnick: for instance crankshaft, the tracing stuff, is relatively new for v8 whereas it's been in monkey for a while
[08:09] cachemoney: although node has had some memory leaks in the past
[08:09] pyrotechnick: so i imagine it's a little better
[08:09] pyrotechnick: but then v8's templates and what-not are pure ownage compared
[08:09] enzo: someone knows what server is behing facebook chat system ?
[08:09] cachemoney: node on v8 debugging is terrible
[08:10] chapel: enzo: well they use xmpp
[08:10] cachemoney: enzo: custom erlang
[08:10] pyrotechnick: i think their chat server is on github
[08:10] cachemoney: doubt it
[08:10] enzo: you mean jabber and so on chapel ?
[08:10] cachemoney: their "chat server" is a bunch of different services written in different languages
[08:10] pyrotechnick: jabber=xmpp
[08:10] chapel: jabber is just an xmpp application
[08:10] cachemoney: the heart of it being erlang
[08:11] pyrotechnick: an installation
[08:11] indexzero has joined the channel
[08:11] pyrotechnick: http://www.jabber.org/
[08:11] pyrotechnick: what server does jabber.org run?
[08:12] cachemoney: enzo: http://www.erlang-factory.com/upload/presentations/31/EugeneLetuchy-ErlangatFacebook.pdf
[08:12] enzo: a node.js with socket.io (v7 as it seems to support cluster or sth like that) could handle such a load, like facebook chat ?
[08:12] herbySk74 has joined the channel
[08:12] pyrotechnick: that's like asking if rails can handle facebook chat
[08:12] cachemoney: probably not
[08:13] pyrotechnick: yeah it could, with enough machines
[08:13] RushPL has joined the channel
[08:13] cachemoney: it would cost a heck of a lot more
[08:13] pyrotechnick: i guess what you're asking is if they switched out erlang for node on the same hardware
[08:13] `3rdEden: enzo: socket.io 0.7 will not support cluster, but have it own multi process management
[08:13] pyrotechnick: for which my answer is NFI
[08:14] enzo: Well I guess that with enough machines even a worst language could handle it, the question underneath is more: is node.js a good competitor to xmpp ?
[08:14] cachemoney: apples to monkeys comparison
[08:14] joshontheweb has joined the channel
[08:14] pyrotechnick: enzo xmpp is just a protocol
[08:14] pyrotechnick: you can implement xmpp on node.js
[08:15] cachemoney: `3rdEden: socket.io can do multiple processes? fork()?
[08:15] pyrotechnick: just as facebook has on erlang
[08:15] cachemoney: there actually is an xmpp implementation on node.js
[08:15] pyrotechnick: not a server
[08:15] pyrotechnick: only a component framework
[08:15] chapel: xml is still a pita on node/js
[08:15] pyrotechnick: node-xmpp isn't a server if that's what you're thinking of
[08:15] enzo: yes but in terms of speed node.js is has fast as the facebook xmpp server ? (for the same audience)
[08:16] pyrotechnick: we guess not
[08:16] christkv has joined the channel
[08:16] chapel: enzo: that is highly subjective
[08:16] pyrotechnick: but without actually crunching some numbers who knows
[08:16] `3rdEden: cachemoney: it does not fork, you just start up multiple instances of you node script so you have multiple processes
[08:16] pyrotechnick: from what i've heard, and this isn't based off much it could be as fast if not faster
[08:16] pyrotechnick: but it certainly wouldn't be as stable
[08:16] enzo: just to have your opinion chapel :) i know all those questions are subjectives
[08:16] pyrotechnick: erlang has a much stronger concurrency model
[08:16] pyrotechnick: it was designed to scale very well with stability in mind
[08:17] chapel: well, I have no experience with erlang, or facebooks chat systems, so I can't say
[08:17] pyrotechnick: it's built into the language itself
[08:17] cachemoney: `3rdEden: can't you do that with pretty much any node app? (provided no memory sharing is necessary)
[08:17] cachemoney: pyrotechnick: i was thinking of this: https://github.com/mwild1/xmppjs
[08:17] pyrotechnick: http://xmppjs.prosody.im/ is a library for http://nodejs.org/ that allows you to connect to an XMPP server as a component.
[08:17] cachemoney: yeah, not a server
[08:17] pyrotechnick: read the first line
[08:17] pyrotechnick: lol
[08:17] `3rdEden: cachemoney: yes you can do that with any script
[08:17] pyrotechnick: i started one
[08:18] pyrotechnick: but i gave up
[08:18] cachemoney: someone should write one
[08:18] pyrotechnick: xmpp is strange it's like a good idea in theory
[08:18] kawaz_air has joined the channel
[08:18] pyrotechnick: but then in practise it's really verbose and overkill for 99% of applications
[08:18] test has joined the channel
[08:18] `3rdEden: cachemoney: but thats not the point here.. when you have long living connections on one process you might still want to be able to transmit messages from a other process to the connection..

[08:19] cachemoney: pyrotechnick: they use thrift heavily

[08:29] `3rdEden: cachemoney: they will, at nodecamp :p
[08:29] cachemoney: isn't that in december?
[08:29] `3rdEden: that like, tomorrow
[08:29] pyrotechnick: https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/LICENSE
[08:29] lstep: I ask this because someone posted a screenshot on reddit saying that one requires a written permission from Joyent to use it in a commercial project: https://img.skitch.com/20110505-t9yhnmpu1isrnqf36fckd3aqya.png
[08:29] cachemoney: you mean nodeconf?
[08:29] `3rdEden: cachemoney: I mean, nodeconf :$
[08:29] pyrotechnick: lstep: read the logs from this room about 3 hours ago
[08:29] pyrotechnick: lstep: ryah explains it more
[08:30] pyrotechnick: it was a bit of a heated discussion
[08:30] lstep: but is this true?
[08:30] pyrotechnick: yes
[08:30] lstep: :-(
[08:30] cachemoney: written permission for MIT licensed code? wtf?
[08:30] pyrotechnick: http://blog.nodejs.org/2011/04/29/trademark/
[08:30] `3rdEden: It's only about the use of the name, not the code it self
[08:30] `3rdEden: Y u bitching o_o
[08:30] cachemoney: oh ok
[08:30] chapel: not the code, just the name node.js
[08:30] cachemoney: yeah i read about that on HN
[08:30] eldios: guys actually read the slides..
[08:31] chapel: or the use of node in relation to node.js
[08:31] eldios: they're talking about the "mark"
[08:31] eldios: you cannot use "NodeJS" .. not the code
[08:31] `3rdEden: well you can use it
[08:31] chapel: but that is in promotion
[08:31] cachemoney: quick someone fork and called it SJedon
[08:31] eldios: fork the code.. name it "uber ultra server special edition JS" and then you can do whatever you want
[08:31] `3rdEden: you just ask permission for it
[08:31] chapel: you can say, that you used node.js
[08:31] chapel: but if you say, BlahBlah Company - A node.js technology company
[08:32] pyrotechnick: then you get joyented
[08:32] chapel: that would be something you would have to get a license for
[08:32] cachemoney: isn't this because Joyent is legally required to protect its trademark in order not to lose rights to it?
[08:32] pyrotechnick: who knows
[08:32] pyrotechnick: ry seems to think so
[08:32] pyrotechnick: and i trust him
[08:33] pyrotechnick: they could be an oracle about it one day though
[08:33] pyrotechnick: or they could "sell" it to someone who is
[08:33] pyrotechnick: but meh
[08:33] chapel: if you don't protect your trademark, you can lose it
[08:33] cachemoney: Oracle buys Joyent for $100MM
[08:33] Melkor has joined the channel
[08:33] `3rdEden: pyrotechnick: yay, selling open source code?
[08:33] pyrotechnick: yeah like if google doesnt pwn people for saying "googling"
[08:33] chapel: the code is mit
[08:33] pyrotechnick: `3rdEden: ry "sold" it to joyent
[08:33] snearch has joined the channel
[08:33] chapel: so no matter what, it will always be in the hands of the people
[08:33] pyrotechnick: so joyent can "sell" it to someone else
[08:34] cachemoney: yeah but it's MIT licensed so "selling" the code doesn't mean much
[08:34] pyrotechnick: you sell the copyright notice in the code headers and therefor the rights to trademark it
[08:34] pyrotechnick: nothing more, nothing less
[08:34] pyrotechnick: you sell a diff
[08:34] pyrotechnick: a commit

[08:42] pyrotechnick: anyway i'm told by the legal peeps at work that it's totally unenforceable
[08:42] pyrotechnick: because node.js was in widespread use before the trademark, i mean i have it on my tshirt ffs
[08:42] pyrotechnick: if joyent were that serious theyd have issued a takedown of http://www.redbubble.com/people/dmitrybaranovsk/t-shirts/5821133-node-js by now
[08:43] blkcat: we just need to make a concerted effort to start referring to some mundane everyday object as a 'node.js'

[09:59] tmedema: 3rdEden, care to elaborate? ;)
[09:59] `3rdEden: Socket.IO's primary transport is a WebSocket connection, to establish a WebSocket connection with the server, the server needs to handle the HTTP Upgrade header
[10:00] `3rdEden: So that's the reason why your server gets a http upgrade event tmedema

[10:29] pyrotechnick: i got the script somewhere
[10:29] pyrotechnick: it will work tmedema
[10:29] pyrotechnick: but you wont be able to bind to 80
[10:29] tmedema: pyrotechnick: is that a problem?
[10:29] pyrotechnick: anything under 1000 i think
[10:29] mendel_: tmedema: it's for the flash policy file

[10:30] xeodox: What's the best node module for caching using redis?
[10:30] pyrotechnick: http://myawesomesite.com:somethingabove1000
[10:30] mendel_: redis
[10:30] xeodox: mendel_ , how can I make things expire though?
[10:30] xeodox: I have the redis module that sets/gets, but how do I make things expire so it doesn't go forever..
[10:30] pyrotechnick: redis has TTL
[10:31] pyrotechnick: u can do that within redis itself
[10:31] polotek: ryah: ping
[10:31] pyrotechnick: not sure if there's any redis adapters that support caching themselves though it seems like the kind of thing u needa build into your app
[10:31] tmedema: alright -- next question, my client causes a "ECONNRESET, Connection reset by peer" when trying to stream audio using the HTML5 audio element. Anyone has a clue on why this could happen?

[10:32] `3rdEden: tmedema: the delays can go up to 3 seconds for a inital connection if you don't use the Flash port
[10:32] `3rdEden: mendel_ ^
[10:33] tmedema: `3rdEden: wow, that's way too long -- guess I will use root for now and think of a proper solution before I push it to production mode
[10:33] `3rdEden: The inline flash file servering is only there as fallback, and really, should not be used by default
[10:33] jonaslund has joined the channel
[10:33] mendel_: `3rdEden: 3 seconds? you're sure about that?
[10:33] xeodox: I can't find an example how to make the redis record expire (TTL) https://github.com/mranney/node_redis
[10:33] `3rdEden: What basically happens is that the Flash player will still make a request to the port, and it has get a timeout from the server.
[10:33] pyrotechnick: redis.io

[10:34] mendel_: `3rdEden: so you use iptables to forward it to another port?

[10:35] seivan has joined the channel
[10:35] mendel_: `3rdEden: that's how you do it?
[10:36] `3rdEden: mendel_: but take in mind that nginx doesn't do HTTP 1.1 proxying so you will need to run Socket.IO on a different port.. And as my tests are telling me.. atleast 4% of all users are behind a firewall here that can't access other ports numbers than the defaults

[12:22] tmedema: `3rdEden: there is no socket property for a http request

[12:22] TheDeveloper: or is the redistribution larger than that
[12:22] `3rdEden: it's larger than that

[12:59] test1: does anyone recommend coffee script?

[13:00] test1: okay..
[13:00] test1: reason 2?
[13:00] floby: test1: I looked at it, never find it interesting enough
[13:00] jacobolus: reason 2: it encourages using anonymous functions in all kinds of useful places, because they are syntactically cheap
[13:00] floby: con 1: all your function are anonymous, which is a pain to debug
[13:01] jacobolus: javascript is actually quite a nice language (w/r/t semantics) for writing partially-functional-style code
[13:01] jacobolus: browsers have fantastic debuggers these days
[13:01] jacobolus: but the syntax for creating functions is awful
[13:01] jacobolus: in javascript

[13:03] heavysixer has joined the channel
[13:03] floby: true for the keyword, but I find braces actually visually clear
[13:03] jacobolus: I'm a python guy though, so probably biased

[13:03] jacobolus: not worth arguing
[13:03] floby: must be bias
[13:04] floby: I can't stand whitespace sensitive languages
[13:04] floby: I agree not worth arguing. but the everything-anonymous of coffeescript bugs me
[13:04] jacobolus: if you're used to something else, then it takes a couple days to get used to; not a big deal in practice
[13:05] floby: I name almost all my function so that they can appear in a stack trace
[13:06] floby: I tried coffeescript, but I was always thinking of what it was compiling to so I reckoned I shouldn't bother using it at all
[13:06] jacobolus: test1: there are also reasons 3-50, but you should just play with it and see if you like it
[13:06] floby: jacobolus: +1 =) coffeescript is mostly alright

[13:08] jacobolus: how do you decide whether "anything" is "worth using"?

[13:13] jacobolus: I don't understand

[13:14] jacobolus: but in CS it's quite natural
[13:15] jacobolus: test1: node.js for example is an API designed entirely around using callbacks all over the place. JS syntax makes this much harder and less clear than it should be

[13:18] sunnyohno has joined the channel
[13:19] Billbad has joined the channel
[13:19] jacobolus: var abs, atan2, cos, exp, floor, pow, round, sin, sqrt;
[13:19] jacobolus: atan2 = Math.atan2, sin = Math.sin, cos = Math.cos, exp = Math.exp, abs = Math.abs, sqrt = Math.sqrt, pow = Math.pow, round = Math.round, floor = Math.floor
[13:19] jacobolus: is the JS alternative
[13:20] Vertice has joined the channel
[13:20] floby: the JS alternative is Math.cos
[13:21] jacobolus: badboy_: so why is /usr/local/lib/node_modules not in require.paths from the node shell, but apparently is when I'm using the coffeescript shell?
[13:21] jlecker has joined the channel
[13:21] xeodox has joined the channel
[13:22] jacobolus: floby: okay, but what about when the thing you're trying to give a nice name to is called dojo.some.ridiculous.long.name or yahoo.some.other.ridiculous.thing
[13:23] uho has joined the channel
[13:23] floby: when I type
[13:23] floby: `require.paths` in the coffee shell it outputs the same as node's
[13:23] jacobolus: the point is that the syntax shortcut is nice, not that you have to make better names for math functions
[13:23] Tidwell has joined the channel
[13:24] floby: jacobolus: it also is polluting of a namespace and closure
[13:24] markc has joined the channel
[13:24] jacobolus: which is why it's nice that you have to do that explicitly
[13:24] jacobolus: I don't get your point
[13:25] jacobolus: floby: you are welcome to use or not use whatever names you like; I'm just pointing out that a commonly needed thing is cumbersome in javascript and not in coffeescript
[13:25] jacobolus: do whatever you want
[13:26] floby: jacobolus: agreed
[13:26] jacobolus: floby: huh. I get the same require.paths in both too. but if I `require('underscore')` it works in the coffeescript shell but not in the node shell
[13:26] floby: lemme try this 
[13:26] jacobolus: in the node shell it spits out Error: Cannot find module 'underscore'
[13:27] floby: where is installed underscore ?
[13:27] jacobolus: whereas in the coffee shell it loads w/o complaint
[13:27] seivan has joined the channel
[13:27] brolin has joined the channel
[13:27] jacobolus: in /usr/local/lib/node_modules/
[13:29] floby: I discussed this with isaacs on his article about local vs global. Apparently you shouldn't be able to require globally installed module without linking them locally
[13:29] matyr_: check: module.paths
[13:30] __sorin__ has joined the channel
[13:30] boghog has joined the channel
[13:30] floby: matyr_: funny. in the coffee shell it's empty, in node it contains /etc/node_modules and /node_modules
[13:30] max_dev has joined the channel
[13:30] jacobolus: in node, module.paths is apparently any "node_modules" directory in any parent of the CWD
[13:30] asdfsafdsa: how do you get current directory of script?
[13:31] jacobolus: module.filename apparently
[13:31] floby: asdfsafdsa: current working directory or actualy directory your script is in?
[13:31] floby: actual*
[13:31] asdfsafdsa: actual
[13:31] jacobolus: floby: so why shouldn't you be able to require global modules?
[13:31] jacobolus: floby: what's the point of making them "global" in that case?
[13:32] jacobolus: that seems counterintuitive enough to be called "broken"
[13:32] floby: jacobolus: in order to be able to use their binaries if they provide any
[13:32] Tidwell: floby: as far as i know, modules installed with -g don't need to be installed locally - they can be, but I haven't run into that issue...
[13:32] jonpacker has joined the channel
[13:33] jacobolus: floby: so you can use their binaries but not import them?
[13:33] Tidwell: floby: ohh yea, for binaries like express's scaffolding and stuff I have seen that
[13:33] jacobolus: that seems terrible
[13:33] rworth has joined the channel
[13:33] jacobolus: what's the rationale?
[13:33] floby: http://blog.nodejs.org/2011/03/23/npm-1-0-global-vs-local-installation/#comment-168
[13:34] TheDeveloper: tmedema: thanks for the quora link and `3rdEden: awesome, thanks
[13:34] floby: If you need to require a module installed globally, you have to link it
[13:34] floby: npm link <package>
[13:34] jacobolus: floby: so can I somehow set it to install to {prefix}/lib/node ?
[13:35] jacobolus: floby: seems like then everything will work properly
[13:35] jacobolus: I'd really rather not have crap floating around in ~/.whatever
[13:36] floby: I'm not sure if you can, maybe in your .npmrc. But you can also have an environment variable called NODE_PATH which contains a list of directories to be added to require.paths
[13:36] devdazed has joined the channel
[13:36] jacobolus: alright, I can add /usr/local/lib/node_modules there
[13:36] floby: however, require.paths will surely go away in future versions, so this might not be a good idea in the long run
[13:37] floby: I'm not sure, maybe it adds it to module.paths
[13:37] edude03 has joined the channel
[13:37] floby: no, no it adds it to require.paths
[13:39] jacobolus: great, that works
[13:39] jacobolus: floby: thanks!
[13:39] floby: jacobolus: no problem
[13:40] floby: jacobolus: I'm still fooling around with npm 1.0 so I discover things everyday

[14:19] gf3: gah, is npm bunlde gone in 1.0?
[14:19] nexxy has joined the channel
[14:19] Aikar: yeah. just npm install your deps, then dont list them in package.json
[14:20] Aikar: and then 'publish' with them in the folder
[14:20] gf3: well that is silly!
[14:20] Aikar: not really
[14:20] Aikar: yoiu need your deps there to do testing anyways
[14:20] sivy has joined the channel
[14:20] strmpnk has joined the channel
[14:21] Aikar: so simply publish with them in the package
[14:21] Aikar: i really prefer that then letting npm manage depdencies anyways
[14:21] Aikar: then your package can be installed from npm or git w/o issue
[14:21] Tidwell: mendel_: commit to git repo, ssh to prod machine, npm install dependancies, git pull.
[14:22] gf3: Aikar: yea but that's simple to do w/ npm bundle
[14:22] jonathanh has joined the channel
[14:22] ximo has joined the channel
[14:22] Aikar: gf3: and im saying thats simply how npm publish works now by default
[14:22] Aikar: if you want to bundle your dependencies, simply dont list them in package.json, no extra commands to worry about
[14:23] mendel_: I'm now just doing a simple rsync or scp if it's not on git, but that's a nice one too
[14:23] Aikar: you have your folder foo/, foo depends on bar, so npm install bar, gives you foo/node_modules/bar, then npm publish, bam, bar is part of the foo package
[14:24] gf3: Aikar: I'd like to do both
[14:24] gf3: ideally
[14:24] Aikar: 'do both' ?
[14:24] Aikar: what other thing is there to do?
[14:24] gf3: node_modules and npm-managed
[14:24] Tidwell: gf3: you mean list it in package.json and still bundle?
[14:24] Aikar: npm puts them in node_modules for you
[14:24] gf3: npm is complaining if I have non-npm packages in node_modules too
[14:24] Aikar: whats the point?
[14:24] gf3: Tidwell, yes
[14:25] Aikar: really? why would isaacs add something to complain about stuff in node_modules?
[14:25] nibblebot has joined the channel
[14:25] Aikar: id ignore em
[14:25] gf3: I would too, except it's fatal
[14:25] Tidwell: gf3: if it complains, you can probably just npm link them and it'll prolly shut up
[14:26] gf3: http://cloud.gf3.ca/6VXY
[14:26] Aikar: thats a bug then, even if it was his intent, thats not acceptable
[14:26] mjr_ has joined the channel
[14:26] Aikar: oh you did a plain install w/o a module name?
[14:26] Aikar: you need to say 'npm install blah'
[14:26] gf3: Aikar: it installs from package.json, no? has that changed too?
[14:26] Aikar: plain 'npm install' i think is for installing bin globally?
[14:27] Aikar: and dev depencies
[14:27] test1: has anyone written a website in node?
[14:27] gf3: no
[14:27] Aikar: gf3: look at the error, its saying some package doesnt have a package.json
[14:27] gf3: Aikar: it installs the deps from package.json into node_modules
[14:27] tyler-iphone: test1: http://nostat.us:8080/site/
[14:27] Aikar: is IRC your module?
[14:27] gf3: Aikar: yes, I have manually put that in node_modules
[14:27] gf3: Aikar: yes
[14:27] test1: brill thanks 
[14:28] test1: open source?
[14:28] Aikar: gf3: ok so thats a bug in npm, it shouldnt fatally crash because of a non package.json folder
[14:28] gf3: Aikar: indeed
[14:28] tyler-iphone: test1: https://github.com/tjgillies/framed
[14:28] test1: lovely stuff
[14:28] Aikar: but id recommend npm install <each dep> then remove them from the package.json, then npm publish
[14:29] Aikar: if you want to bundle

[14:31] mattrobenolt has joined the channel
[14:31] kioopii: tyler-iphone, the sign-in-popup is an abomination.
[14:31] Aikar: if you list them, npm will intentionally ignore them on publish
[14:31] Aikar: therefor it wont be bundled
[14:31] Nietecht has joined the channel
[14:31] Aikar: but it will leave (ie bundle) the modules not listed in package.json
[14:31] EyePulp has joined the channel
[14:32] tyler-iphone: kioopii: its just an example. it doesn't even really do anything
[14:32] ximo has joined the channel
[14:32] Aikar: so if you have foo/node_modules/{a,b,c} and package.json lists b,c as dependencies. the package.tar.gz will have foo/node_modules/a inside it, but not b,c
[14:33] jonathanh: hi
[14:33] tyler-iphone: kioopii: it was just to test client/serverside cookies and embedded client side coffeescript
[14:34] jonathanh: i have the weirdest bug where it seems riak-js is interacting with a file upload and causing it to stall. i'd *love* if a fresh pair of eyes could take a look at the test and see if anything pops out at them...  https://gist.github.com/957127

[15:16] tmedema: stagas, probably not no, but still worth mentioning.. I guess it's good that it does not so you can still use callbacks
[15:16] tmedema: the only edge case is where you pass a function that generates data for the method to use
[15:16] stagas: tmedema: it could toString all functions but the callback
[15:16] tmedema: but that's rather rare
[15:17] tmedema: hmm well how does the ruby one do it? they probably have a lot of experience with it
[15:17] stagas: dunno can't think of a use case you'd want to memoize a function, usually you want it executed somewhere

[15:56] DrHeiter23: trying to create a simple Model using mongoose for a User, with types like _id:Object, email:String, etc.. I was just wondering what/if is the difference in specifying a type as myADT: {prop1:[],prop2:[]}  can I even do that? An object that has two arrays? Will it handle that fine?
[15:56] tjholowaychuk: EvanCarroll: no, jade cannot safely assume anything within text is not text
[15:56] eldios: that was hard to write
[15:57] tjholowaychuk: EvanCarroll: that's for stuff like markdown
[15:57] eldios: tjholowaychuk, what if you use |
[15:57] ivanfi has left the channel
[15:57] eldios: will it newline all the same?
[15:57] tjholowaychuk: you still need the tag on it's own line yeah
[15:57] tjholowaychuk: | foo\na(href='#') something\n| bar
[15:57] eldios: I was saying like
[15:58] eldios: p\n\s\s|foo\n|a(href='#') link\n|bar
[15:58] mape: that seems like black magic
[15:58] eldios: will it put it on a new line all the same?
[15:58] tjholowaychuk: if you have the | first it's just text

[16:13] mape: oops, sry mscdex , meant mc_greeny 
[16:14] mape: mc_greeny: or look at something like the request module
[16:14] CloudTwoPointOh: Do you guys add an init script to /etc/init ?
[16:14] mc_greeny: mape: thx!

[16:17] codetonowhere has joined the channel
[16:17] CloudTwoPointOh: What do you use to start your node.js server?
[16:17] mape: But it would be neat to have somekinda central place for "common" questions, like if people should use supervisor, monit, forever, cluster or whatever
[16:17] CloudTwoPointOh: right
[16:18] mape: CloudTwoPointOh: screen, cluster and notifications on when it is down. Seems to work for now
[16:18] tjholowaychuk: sweet didnt know our regexps supported \1 etc
[16:18] tjholowaychuk: yay
[16:18] mape: But for sure, configuring monit/supervisor sound like a good idea
[16:18] tjholowaychuk: CloudTwoPointOh: yeah we use monit + cluster, using a few cluster plugins for report logging and email notifications
[16:18] CloudTwoPointOh: cool
[16:19] CloudTwoPointOh: I am using node.js just for the model layer of my web app.
[16:19] mendel_: CloudTwoPointOh: forever, nginx for proxy (need it for ruby)
[16:19] stagas: mape: been working on a wiki thing I wanna use in nodejs.eu
[16:19] CloudTwoPointOh: Yeah, I use nginx
[16:19] jonathanh: CloudTwoPointOh: i don't get as many hits as mape, but i use supervisor for keeping backend node-based daemons running and cherokee to reverse-proxy and invoke node for the front-end
[16:19] sarkis has joined the channel
[16:20] CloudTwoPointOh: So how many node servers for a web site/web app is common?

[16:20] mape: stagas: God damit, you keep stealing my ideas! :P

[16:20] CloudTwoPointOh: I just wondered if sometimes people split up functionality across different node servers (I don't)
[16:20] eresair has joined the channel
[16:21] mape: jonathanh: any reason to use cherokee rather then nginx? (other then neat web gui?)
[16:21] stagas: mape: I was thinking of it more like a link directory for node, but user editable
[16:21] mape: CloudTwoPointOh: Seems like the new hot thing is to keep things small and have them fail well
[16:21] d0k has joined the channel
[16:21] mape: So tons of processes with good APIs should be a good idea

[16:22] mape: CloudTwoPointOh: Yup
[16:22] jonathanh: mape: not really, no. my business partner had more experience with cherokee...  and i'll admit, the web gui is pretty nice to have (and this from someone who for many years swore by manually editing config files with vi)
[16:22] mape: That way you can start out on one server, and then move them of easily

[16:24] mape: stagas: So if you plan on stealing my ideas, please steal this one and make it :P I want munin.. But I want nodes to be able to register without the central server handling it.
[16:25] zeade has joined the channel
[16:25] mape: So I have a central server just running, and then I can just start adding nodes with id's that start plotting neat things

[16:27] stagas: mape: oh that's another project, not the wiki
[16:27] mape: stagas: ah yeah :P
[16:27] mape: munin is for graphing stats
[16:28] eguest309: anybody had any succcess in stalling it
[16:28] mape: and I want that, but have the hive mind not control things, just collect, so I have a hive mind that displays the data, but I can arbitrarily add new nodes that start plotting data
[16:29] Corren has joined the channel
[16:29] mape: Kinda have something working, just need a good way of graphing an object with tons of data. Multiple levels deep, load, memory/disk usage, mongo/nginx req/stats etc etc
[16:30] stagas: mape: dnode would work though it's heavy
[16:30] e6nian: Never explicitly use app.router with express. It should work after that. what's this mean?
[16:30] kmiyashiro: anyone know why I always get this error when updating npm on OS X? npm ERR! Could not get uid/gid 
[16:30] gonsfx has joined the channel
[16:31] tjholowaychuk: e6nian: huh?
[16:31] tjholowaychuk: where does it say that?
[16:31] tjholowaychuk: it's fine to use app.router
[16:31] mape: stagas: well not so much the transport, it is just json with sys-men/app-mem,load etc etc. But I would have to figure out an automated way that isn't to bloated that I could send a "random" object and that would get split into groups and graphs
[16:31] tjholowaychuk: this just lets you place the routing middleware whereever you like
[16:31] demastrie has left the channel
[16:32] mape: stagas: So i can start out with a new Beacon({'id': 'imageServer'+i, 'data': data}), and then just keep adding them as I scale
[16:32] mape: and the data part is the issue, it can be {'load': 0.02} or 4 levels deep with 30 different stats
[16:32] mendel_: tjholowaychuk: what's the story behind LearnBoost? You're a couple of friends? You guys make great software
[16:33] tjholowaychuk: mendel_: I joined a few months after rthey started, it's a pretty weird story though actually haha kinda random
[16:33] mape: and the levels deep would be shown in the UI with grouping and all that
[16:33] tjholowaychuk: basically they were working individually on projects and ended up joining
[16:33] tjholowaychuk: and forming LearnBoost
[16:33] tjholowaychuk: and then me and aaron joined
[16:33] eee_c has joined the channel
[16:33] mendel_: with how many are you now?
[16:34] tjholowaychuk: hmmm about 7
[16:34] stagas: mape: there are ton of graph libs, have you found any that fits? backend doesn't seem too hard
[16:34] tjholowaychuk: only a few developers though
[16:34] mendel_: 4 @ github I see
[16:34] tjholowaychuk: yup
[16:34] mape: stagas: yeah, so the data transfer is easy, graphing is semi easy depending on the data. It is just the format of the data that is puzzeling me right now
[16:35] tjholowaychuk: we are from all over only guillermo is in SFO as far as the programmers go
[16:35] tjholowaychuk: im in canada, not sure where aaron is haha
[16:35] tjholowaychuk: some other place in the US
[16:35] mendel_: thnx for opensourcing the stuff you're making.. 
[16:35] tjholowaychuk: np
[16:35] mendel_: so not working @ one office?
[16:35] eguest309: any ideas

[16:37] mape: but grouped by the context in the json data
[16:38] abraham has joined the channel
[16:39] mape: issue is that things get "bloated" really really fast
[16:39] mape: But if I don't add meta-data on how it should be graphed it would end up being non usefull
[16:40] nadirvardar has joined the channel
[16:40] mape: and good "apis" are the way to go, otherwise it just turns into a hassle
[16:40] e6nian: tjholowaychuk: https://gist.github.com/956508 here, when I  app.use(app.router), the everyauth middleware won't get session work.
[16:40] mape: good APIs and easy to use
[16:41] stagas: mape: can't it figure out the vector max/min by the input data why do you need meta
[16:41] tjholowaychuk: e6nian: looks fine
[16:41] tjholowaychuk: nothing wrong with using it there at all
[16:41] e6nian: TheDeveloper: the deverloper of everyauth told me Never explicitly use app.router with express. It should work after that.
[16:42] mape: stagas: look at munin, I wish it was that simple :(

[16:42] mape: thanks DeltachaosDeskto 
[16:42] tjholowaychuk: e6nian: no thats not true at all
[16:42] tjholowaychuk: in fact
[16:42] DeltachaosDeskto: https://github.com/Deltachaos/Jex
[16:42] tjholowaychuk: you usually should use it
[16:42] tjholowaychuk: but it looks like you might be use()ing everyAuth or w/e after it
[16:42] tjholowaychuk: in which case it would never be hit
[16:42] tjholowaychuk: if oyu dont use app.router it is appended to the bottom
[16:42] aroop has joined the channel
[16:43] mape: stagas: smarter people then me have done things like this before and they haven't figured out a better solution, so I figure I will just end up at the same bumps as they if I don't take it into regard from the start
[16:43] e6nian: tjholowaychuk: what's the meanning of use app.router?
[16:43] mape: tjholowaychuk: so when using cluster, I assume you guys are running multiple instances of it, do you just have tons of urls to different cluster-stat pages?
[16:43] tjholowaychuk: e6nian: app.router is the route middleware
[16:44] tjholowaychuk: it contains all of your routes
[16:44] mape: Or is there any centralized part?

[16:46] tjholowaychuk: haha
[16:47] mape: for sure, but having beacons and sending data to the hive mind should be better rather then having them talk to eachother

[16:47] mape: CloudTwoPointOh: Hook to the google api?

[17:08] gonsfx: e6nian: i require(./controllers) which is /controllers/index.js - i put middleware thats used by many routes there, like checkAuthUser or something along the lines
[17:09] gonsfx: additionally, that file exports stuff like .account, .app, .user which are required and reside inside controllers folder
[17:09] stagas: mape: I'd use mongo & dnode

[17:17] e6nian: tjholowaychuk: my Q: such as the middleware I should use before app.router,and the middleware should also be used to the routers. what should I do to sperate the app router and the config?

[17:18] tjholowaychuk: e6nian: what's wrong with having app.router in your config?

[17:19] tjholowaychuk: e6nian: yeah

[17:19] tjholowaychuk: so config would get super messy
[17:19] mscdex: stride: heh

[21:19] wadey: Corren: you can make nginx set a header like X-Forwarded-Proto: https

[21:19] Corren: ok
[21:20] a|i has joined the channel
[21:20] a|i has joined the channel
[21:20] context: monokrome: yeah :( i personally think npm 1.0 broke a lot more than it solved.
[21:20] a|i: 'The underlying browser-server connection is provided by Socket.IO, which does not currently scale.' (https://github.com/aaronblohowiak/Push-It) wtf?!
[21:20] zomgbie has joined the channel
[21:20] monokrome: Looks like it.
[21:20] a|i: so socket.io does not scale?
[21:21] Corren: what do I do with that at the node layer though wadey? that header doesn't actually enforce ssl encryption does it
[21:21] wadey: you can then do:  if (req.headers['x-forwarded-proto'] === 'https') ....
[21:22] Corren: ah, so even if it's not encrypted, I can detect if actions should be permitted based on https
[21:22] ibrahimal-rajhi has joined the channel
[21:22] context: a|i: i fail to see how the browser-server connection has anything to do with pushing messages.
[21:22] wadey: correct
[21:22] Corren: what about the dialog (on my private network) being cleartext between nginx and node
[21:22] Corren: is that something to worry about

[21:23] context: corren: uhh, you tell us ?
[21:23] jacobolus has joined the channel
[21:23] Corren: well for example, the idea of having passwords passed in cleartext, even on a private network on my backend still gives me pause
[21:23] a|i: context: is the argument of socketio on node not being scalable correct?
[21:23] context: so you dont trust your own private network?
[21:23] Corren: well, my private network at a hosting provider like linode provides zero assurances that you're vlaned
[21:23] context: then i dont trust your service even if it is over https.
[21:24] Corren: context: linode doesn't configure vlans for private networks
[21:24] Corren: so my linode vms are on the same private network as someone elses :S
[21:24] monokrome: a|i: Why wouldn't it be scalable?
[21:24] context: corren: then make your own private networn (vpn?) or demand a vlan, or get a new provider
[21:24] wadey: i agree, if you can't trust your network then why should I as your user :)
[21:24] a|i: monokrome: that was my question, see this: https://github.com/aaronblohowiak/Push-It scroll down to the end
[21:25] Corren: or, have one of my node layers also communicate https (bleh)

[23:48] techwraith: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4753957/socket-io-authentication

[23:49] a|i: context: rails uses http-only sessions.
[23:49] techwraith: it's a bit old, but it should work

[23:53] a|i: so we have a session cookie created by rails, we send it to node, how can node trust that this cookie is a valid one?
[23:53] context: And IF you are using session based cookies.... You need to decrypt the session from thencookie the same way rails does if someone has not written a library to do that already 
[23:54] context: Rails signs it.
[23:54] context: How do you think rails trusts it...
[23:54] context: You need to check this.
