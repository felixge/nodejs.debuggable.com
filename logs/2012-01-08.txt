[00:10] isaacs: maxogden: it's a bit dumb about that
[00:11] maxogden: isaacs: i figured, but how can i use the smart codez in npm
[00:11] isaacs: maxogden: cd ..
[00:11] isaacs: maxogden: do that until it works ;P

[00:52] wilmoore has joined the channel
[00:53] disappe__: Aria: tbranyen: yeah the link's for you guys 
[00:54] Aria: Make an event emitter out of the whole pile, and couple just based on that.
[00:54] Aria: yourgame.on('turnend', function() {do stuff ...})
[00:54] Aria: And when the thing that decides a turn is done runs, have it run yourgame.emit('turndone')
[00:54] disappe__: Ah I see 
[00:55] Aria: That's what I'd do, anyway. There's many ways to do it, but that seems like the right amount of coupling.
[00:55] disappe__: so basically I can think of my app as the following (user voting) => (decide the winner etc) => (user voting) ... 
[00:56] disappe__: so I should structure my app in such a way that when user is done voting, votingDone is emitted, and then decide the winner will emit turnDone 
[00:56] innociv: node.js doesn't have any built in framework things, does it?  Like an array.remove() sort of function instead of having to slice it and such.

[00:56] disappe__: innociv: use underscore.js

[01:08] Prometheus has joined the channel
[01:08] cmr: mightym: makes perfect sense, but if you are running apache /just/ for the proxy, it makes sense to use something lighter like nginx

[01:09] mightym: cmr: and should i also use nginx for serving static files or node?
[01:10] mansoor: mightym: either will work, but nginx is more efficient
[01:10] chilts: you could decide that depending on how your application is set up

[03:18] josephmoniz has joined the channel
[03:21] Shaunzie: dougneiner: Ok I'm guessing the problem is that /Users/doug/.nave/src/0.6.4 isn't in your path. Try appending that to your path variable and try making it again
[03:21] dougneiner: ok
[03:21] dougneiner: $PATH or $NODE_PATH

[03:26] Shaunzie: dougneiner: wait what version are you using?
[03:27] Shaunzie: dougneiner: node --version
[03:27] dougneiner: v0.6.4
[03:27] dougneiner: I had 0.6.6 installed earlier
[03:27] dougneiner: and it was doing the same thing
[03:28] dougneiner: How do you recommend installing node?
[03:28] dougneiner: I can start over if you think that would help
[03:28] Shaunzie: dougneiner: that might help actually. I personally use brew
[03:28] dougneiner: ok
[03:29] dougneiner: any tips for getting my system back to a  "clean" starting point?
[03:29] Shaunzie: dougneiner: http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/
[03:29] dougneiner: yes, I have brew installed

[03:30] dougneiner: ok
[03:30] Shaunzie: https://github.com/isaacs/nave
[03:31] Shaunzie: Once that's done, I'd suggesting removing your $NODE_PATH 
[03:31] dougneiner: removed from .bashrc and .bash_profile - is it anywhere else?
[03:32] Shaunzie: don't think so but you can check after it's removed.
[03:32] Shaunzie: echo $NODE_PATH
[03:34] dougneiner: ok
[03:34] dougneiner: brew is installing node
[03:34] dougneiner: 0.6.6
[03:36] Shaunzie: dougneiner: ok try installing sqlite3 again
[03:36] Shaunzie: Checking for node prefix                 : not found
[03:36] dougneiner: SHould I follow both steps from homebrew? 
[03:36] dougneiner: Homebrew has NOT installed npm. We recommend the following method of
[03:36] dougneiner: installation:
[03:36] dougneiner:   curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
[03:36] dougneiner: After installing, add the following path to your NODE_PATH environment
[03:36] dougneiner: variable to have npm libraries picked up:
[03:36] dougneiner:   /usr/local/lib/node_modules
[03:36] dougneiner: ahhh- should have put in a gist, sorry
[03:36] Shaunzie: dougneiner: do you already have npm installed?
[03:37] Shaunzie: dougneiner: which npm
[03:37] tbranyen: iirc there is a brew command to have it install npm as well
[03:37] josephmoniz has left the channel
[03:37] dougneiner: npm -v
[03:37] dougneiner: 1.1.0-beta-10
[03:37] dougneiner: tbranyen: ah, ok - wasn't aware of that
[03:37] dougneiner: Shaunzie: it was installed from before
[03:37] isaacs: homebrew should just download the pkg and run it
[03:38] isaacs: cuz seriously.  how could it be any easier to install node on osx than a pkg that Just Works?
[03:38] benvie: so is node master supposed to compile on windows? Because it hasn't for me for a while
[03:38] daleharvey has joined the channel
[03:38] chunhao_ has joined the channel
[03:38] dougneiner: it says there is no formula for npm – and suggest you use the one-liner to install
[03:38] benvie: or if it does, it doesn't run
[03:38] tbranyen: isaacs: i <3 the pkg
[03:39] tbranyen: dougneiner: right, but npm is baked into node now brew just has a default flag to not install it
[03:39] isaacs: dougneiner: yeah
[03:39] tbranyen: there is probably a flag you use when installing node that reenables it
[03:39] dougneiner: ah, ok
[03:39] tbranyen: brew install node --with-npm or something
[03:39] tbranyen: just guessing
[03:40] Shaunzie: dougneiner: curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
[03:40] dougneiner: done
[03:40] tbranyen: hrm not seeing it in the formula
[03:40] dougneiner: do I put NODE_PATH into .bashrc or .bash_profile – or both

[07:35] bingomanatee: anyone have a good recommendation for a nosql repo that does good fuzzy text search? (which means not mongo)
[07:36] martin_sunset: bingomanatee: Solr, or index tank which has been open sourced
[07:36] warz: mongodb isnt a full text search engine, like others are
[07:36] warz: i like elasticsearch
[07:36] dr0id has joined the channel
[07:36] bingomanatee: that sounds like a lark. thanks 
[07:36] warz: its built on lucene, so you might be fine with lucene.
[07:37] perezd:    uncaught undefined: Error: node_redis command queue state error. If you can reproduce this, please report it.
[07:37] perezd: this sounds bad

[07:49] warz: sometimes im positiuve that i must be doing it wrong, because the only module i use mentiuoned there is express
[07:49] martin_sunset: Warz it's a web agency, they rarely use bleeding edge
[07:50] martin_sunset: Warz but it's great that even agencies adopt node
[07:50] LarsSmit has joined the channel
[07:50] erikzaadi has joined the channel
[07:50] martin_sunset: Warz but yeah, check out jade and stylus, love them ;)
[07:51] warz: im using hogan, because i just cant let go of my html. ive yet to venture away from css, too although ive heard stuff like sass and stylus are awesome
[07:51] warz: its just too much for me to change up right now :p
[07:52] martin_sunset: Warz then give stylus a try. You can write normal CSS in it, and gradually move to the new syntax
[07:53] warz: i will seriously need to find a solution to my compiling problem then. currently i just compile coffeescript to js every time i make edits, and then run node app.js.
[07:54] warz: when im doing css, i make edits like crazy and check every edit i make. thatd suck to have to compile that too
[07:54] cmr: eh, not if you had something watching the file and compiling on every change.
[07:54] cmr: Assuming the compile takes <1 sec
[07:54] martin_sunset: Warz stylus has the same watch command, you don't notice
[07:56] warz: ill try it out. might as well. ive looked it over and i know itll be nice.
[07:56] warz: i just really dont think i could drop html, so i dont think ill ever really be tempted to try out jade.
[07:57] warz: right now though im trying to grok the nodejs C++ source. trying to patch the bcrypt module for 0.7 libuv
[07:57] martin_sunset: Warz exactly my thoughts before I started with haml, qthen before I started with jade. Now I don't use anything else
[07:58] martin_sunset: Don't tell me bcrypt is broken in node 0.6???
[07:58] warz: i dont know when node switched to libuv, but yea it breaks moving to it

[13:05] zomg: andrew12: nope, don't think so due to how scope works
[13:06] andrew12: darn

[13:06] zomg: Sounds like a bad idea to me
[13:06] tokumine has joined the channel
[13:07] andrew12: well I wanna separate files so my code is easier to understand, but it's kind of annoying to have to pass around every single object that i use in the other file
[13:07] andrew12: i really just want to run all of the files as if they were one
[13:07] erikzaadi has joined the channel
[13:07] zomg: Sounds like maybe you should think more of how your code is separated if you need to pass around that much stuff :)
[13:08] zomg: Or you could create a "context" object which stores the important stuff
[13:08] zomg: Then just pass that
[13:08] andrew12: well it's kind of like, i have a bunch of helper functions written in the main file
[13:08] andrew12: and some sort of global stuff
[13:09] andrew12: hmm
[13:09] zomg: Maybe you should move the helpers into a separate file, then you could require that

[13:18] majek has joined the channel
[13:18] Lingerance: Yes
[13:18] zomg: If you actually have so much code that it becomes hard to maintain it in a single file, you probably should just split it into modules rather than just tacking a hacky solution like that on it
[13:19] andrew12: the only problem is that I write code in coco and that thing executes javascript.

[13:25] astropirate: i suppose the only language that compiles to JS I MIGHT look into is clojure... but they hate all things js which turns me off
[13:25] zomg: Clojure is so lispy :/
[13:25] zomg: Haskell has some sort of a Haskell-to-JS thing
[13:26] astropirate: shrugs**
[13:26] andrew12: clojure is lisp...
[13:26] zomg: Not sure how good it is though, but if it is then I might consider using that =)
[13:26] astropirate: haskell is the devils spawn
[13:26] zomg: andrew12: exactly :P
[13:26] andrew12: heh
[13:26] astropirate: i tried XMonad DM and i had to play around with haskell NOT fun
[13:26] astropirate: *WM not DM
[13:27] zomg: Haskell is awesome... assuming you've managed to understand all the insanity in it
[13:27] zomg: =)
[13:27] astropirate: :)
[13:27] RLa: btw, anyone tried heavy static typing (through inference) on javascript?
[13:27] astropirate: RLa: not here, but can you give an example?
[13:28] astropirate: or link
[13:28] RLa: var i = 0; <- infers type int for i
[13:28] RLa: no, i do not know such projects
[13:28] zomg: WebStorm tries to do some I think
[13:29] zomg: Not always very succesfully, nor very heavily
[13:29] astropirate: RLa: i know google guys (that hate JS) compile from Java to get "type security"
[13:29] astropirate: with their closoure tools
[13:29] zomg: You could probably get that by compiling from Haskell too
[13:29] RLa: well, what if you do not like java
[13:29] tokumine has joined the channel
[13:29] RLa: and want closures which java does not have
[13:30] astropirate: RLa: hmm lol funny enough i think the latest edition of java supports closures
[13:30] zomg: Not sure but maybe you could use some other JVM language?
[13:30] RLa: it does not
[13:31] RLa: it has been talked for over 5 years but no closures implementation yet
[13:31] astropirate: ohh nvm its being debated

[13:31] booyaa: do we think we'll see a .net or java vm'd version of node?
[13:31] booyaa: thinking of ironpython and jruby
[13:32] RLa: there is rhino, small layer could be written using nio or nio2 or whatever was their latest async io lib
[13:33] RLa: i'm not seeing many benefits of java jvm
[13:33] astropirate: or .net
[13:33] astropirate: unless m$ wants to extend and exterminate <_<
[13:34] RLa: uh, why we need so much complexity
[13:34] astropirate: *embrace (phase complete)   extend (add it to .net!)  exterminate (we'll see..)
[13:34] RLa: all vms and that
[13:34] booyaa: ironpython's been useful in place of powershell in places
[13:35] booyaa: jruby's been useful for using vagrant on 64bit win

[13:45] MRdNk: hi all.  I'm looking at using the Crypto module; and need some advice.  I have previously written an authentication system in ASP.NET - my companies choice of language (booo!).  And I want to rewrite it in node.js - so that I can create a more robust and closer to real-time collaboration between the authentication system and any ASP.NET application that uses it.  So at the moment, user logs in using their credentials, and the return dat
[13:45] MRdNk: Is there a good and secure ecryption algorithum, that can be used by both node and .NET
[13:45] MRdNk: ?
[13:46] zomg: your first message was cut off at "and the return dat"
[13:46] MRdNk: ...  data is encrypted and sent back to them via a form post.

[13:49] MRdNk: is there a rijndael encryption for nodejs?

I'm sure the node newbness shows up in more than a couple places.  It is a cache for the itunes store search api because apple states large websites should have some sort of caching architecture https://github.com/loucal/istore-node-cache  If you look at the

[15:58] TheJH: loucal, here: https://github.com/loucal/istore-node-cache/blob/master/server.js#L76
[15:59] TheJH: loucal, you have some relatively deep nesting there...
[15:59] TheJH: loucal, also, you often ignore "err"
[16:00] loucal: TheJH: thank you.  Yeah, did you check out the DRY_but_ugly branch?
[16:00] TheJH: loucal, not so deep anymore, but still...

[16:00] loucal: TheJH: what would you do about the nesting personally, the async module?

[16:02] TheJH: loucal, also, about the deep nesting: you might want to try streamlinejs
[16:02] TheJH: loucal, that's a good approach :)
[16:02] TheJH: loucal, I personally think that the best solution to the nesting hell is cocos backcall syntax, but people won't be able to read your code anymore :D

[16:03] loucal: nice, thank you so much man im getting a lot of good stuff to look into.  TheJH about your first comment, since I am limiting the response from the itunes server, how can they send a response that is too large?  Sorry not questioning you just want to understand better.
[16:03] TheJH: joshsmith, I often get those, too :D
[16:03] joshsmith: I hope they're not paying CPM
[16:03] TheJH: loucal, no, not talking about your request to itunes

[16:04] loucal: TheJH: sorry, i get that, i mean since that is the only place the response would originate from I thought
[16:04] loucal: but now i am realizing what you mean since it goes into my db if there is a match
[16:05] loucal: the way it is working right now it actually only pulls an exact match for the artist name from my db so any response that doesn't come from itunes is limited to 1 document, if that makes any sense
[16:05] Sami_ZzZ_ has joined the channel
[16:05] loucal: I definitely want to correct it so it doesn't open up a hole in the future, but I am wondering given that, is it still possible to crash it. (not from an I dont feel like fixing it standpoint just simply to understand it before I do)

[16:17] TheJH: joshsmith, uhhh... can't you just, like, define a template function "menuentry" that checks whether its "href" attribute matches the request url?
[16:17] HardPhuc: insin, then i just do #{myfunc(myvar)}
[16:17] loucal: TheJH: I think I misinterpreted what you meant by destroying the socket.. I first tried commenting out line 76 completely, but that gives me error: request not found, so then I just tried removing the body += chunk from it but still same error

[19:31] TheJH: context, why is that a global?
[19:31] TheJH: sgfgdf, yes
[19:32] sgfgdf: TheJH: what is the purpose? everything that returns void will print undefined from now?
[19:32] TheJH: context, like, an errno - doesn't that belong to an Error object instead of "global"?
[19:32] TheJH: sgfgdf, no
[19:33] sgfgdf: TheJH: can you explain, please?
[19:33] TheJH: sgfgdf, function statements are statements, and only expressions return values
[19:33] TheJH: sgfgdf, uh, moment
[19:33] TheJH: sgfgdf, actually, you mean, why it prints undefined instead of nothing?
[19:33] TheJH: sgfgdf, in that case, you're right
[19:34] TheJH: sorry
[19:34] sgfgdf: TheJH: yes, even when i hit enter i get the undefined message.

[19:41] context: sgfgdf: the repl is an interactive terminal. it gives you the response to ANYTHING you give it
[19:42] context: a blank line executed as a statement results with undefined. thus you get undefined
[19:42] context: its not a bug. its how the repl works
[19:42] Juan77 has joined the channel
[19:43] context: sgfgdf: and i imagine when node processes a file it "optimizes out" blank lines. but there ARE statements in your code that result in undefined. whether you give that result to a variable or any sort of input is another thing.
[19:43] context: i imagine the majority of function calls return undefined as most things are async and depend on the calling of a callback later
[19:44] TheJH: context, you can't use the results of statements, only the results of expressions :D
[19:44] context: sgfgdf: what would you suggest eval("") return... it MUST return something
[19:44] thisandagain has joined the channel
[19:45] sgfgdf: context: i was asking because other repls like for example python don't have this behaviour, but what you said sounds somehow reasonable.
[19:46] sgfgdf: anyway thank you, guys for explainig that to me!
[19:46] fwg: <nitpick> a statement does not yield a value, that's what makes it different from an expression, therefore the repl treats everything as an expresstion </nitpick>

[23:50] marcello3d: wow. I just mentioned 'ipad' in a tweet and now I get all this @mention spam

[23:52] bnoordhuis: if you find more of these things, by all means report them
[23:53] marcello3d: sure. it's hard to debug though
[23:53] level09 has joined the channel
[23:53] marcello3d: because the stack trace doesn't tell me the line number
[23:53] marcello3d: the numbers just refer to the function header
[23:53] marcello3d: but I guess that's a sampling problem
[23:54] bnoordhuis: yeah
[23:54] bnoordhuis: joyent's been doing some dtrace work that maps probes back to javascript code
[23:54] marcello3d: I saw the blog post. but that doesn't work on mac, right?

[23:55] mmalecki: it'd be soooo cool if it did
[23:55] bnoordhuis: no, only smartos. dtrace on os x and freebsd is too broken :/

[23:55] marcello3d: do you know the difference between * and ~ before function names in the mactickprocessor output is?

[23:55] joshsmith: okay another Express question: how do I render new lines (\r\n) as HTML line breaks?
[23:56] bnoordhuis: marcello3d: i think so but let me double-check if it's the same for other platforms
[23:56] pauls1_ has joined the channel
[23:56] bnoordhuis: marcello3d: yep, that's the case
[23:56] astromanies: @johnsmith in html you could use the tag <pre> for "pre formatted"
[23:56] Frippe has joined the channel
[23:57] marcello3d: what's the case?
[23:57] bnoordhuis: * means that the code has been optimized, ~ that it hasn't (yet) been optimized
[23:57] marcello3d: ah
[23:57] mikeal has joined the channel
[23:57] astromanies: johnsmith otherwise you have to parse the string and replace str.replace(/\n/g, '<br />')

[23:58] disappea_: if I am calling setTimeout(this.myFunction, 4000) and then inside myFunction there's also a reference to 'this'.. how do I bind the correct context
[23:58] joshsmith: does Express not have a built in way of doing that?
[23:58] springmeyer has joined the channel
[23:59] astromanies: i dont think so
[23:59] astromanies: not even the template engines do it i dont think
[23:59] marcello3d: disappea_: there is a bind method on functions
[23:59] disappea_: on underscore? 
[23:59] marcello3d: on ecmascript5
[23:59] astromanies: boom
