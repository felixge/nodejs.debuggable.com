[02:08] Nuck: RAAAAAAAAAAGE
[02:08] Aria: But nodejs is web scale.

[02:12] Aria: "The chat server nearly took down the service. It checks every 2.5seconds!"
[02:12] Aria: ... they spin up a whole Apache process for each hit.
[02:12] Nuck: lmao
[02:12] Aria: Yes, they do IM by polling.

[02:16] Aria: (And long polling would be worse: this is Apache without mpm_event)
[02:16] Aria: But they have 30,000 clients on line at any given time.
[02:16] Nuck: But spinning up an apache process per connection
[02:16] Nuck: Aria: Oh fuck, what company is this?
[02:17] Aria: Can't say. But it's a work in progress.
[02:17] Aria: If there's time I'll probably fix it. Probably with node.
[02:18] igl: i know 2 php devs who would do exactly the same ^^

[02:22] Nuck: Now THAT is a prime example.
[02:22] Aria: Yeah? Is it good?

[03:14] davidascher has joined the channel
[03:15] perlmonkey2: I'm also using dnode which after inspecting the lib appears to add some middleware which does something with the request object.
[03:17] JoshC1 has joined the channel
[03:18] jesusabdullah: perlmonkey2: I doubt dnode is borking the req object.
[03:18] perlmonkey2: jesusabdullah: yeah, I didn't see anything in dnode which would overwrite the session store (that'd be bizarre), but it might be a clue to something.

[03:52] TheEmpath: they program in php and flash, which is ass cheeks, because if you want to debug the server calls, it interupts the control flow and busts the client.  i made a node server and a trace() call in php that socket connects to the node server and routes the contents of the trace to the user who is connecte dto a page via socket.io
[03:53] jesusabdullah: Haha, awesome
[03:53] TheEmpath: this way the server keeps running, the error gets reported, i can get alot of data about whats going on in the server, and i can measure its changes over time
[03:53] TheEmpath: UNFORTUNATELY the call to the server has to be blocking

[04:14] SubStack: konobi: indeed
[04:15] isaacs: TheEmpath: what message would that send?  "Use node.js, because it is DEEPLY DISTURBING"?

[04:19] jamescarr: site you can go to, paste html into, and get jade output
[04:19] jamescarr: bonus points if supports coffeekup and haml ;)
[04:19] TheEmpath: im starting to code my php as if it was capable of continual states, instead of the default statelessness
[04:19] isaacs: jamescarr: because jade is hard to write...?
[04:19] jesusabdullah: What do you mean by that?
[04:19] isaacs: "Now you can use all your favorite HTML tools to write Jade templates, too!!"
[04:20] jesusabdullah: isaacs: Or, because you want to convert your old html to jade?
[04:20] TheEmpath: i mean im starting to see my server calls as total control flows instead of little isolated API snippets
[04:20] jamescarr: isaacs, no, existing html t :)
[04:20] isaacs: ...oh, yeah, that too ;)
[04:20] jamescarr: that I want as a jade template
[04:20] isaacs: that makes more sense.
[04:20] jesusabdullah: It'd be handy for migration
[04:20] Stythys: yeah converting old code would be awesome
[04:20] SubStack: I like state.
[04:20] SubStack: I am a stack after all.
[04:20] TheEmpath: i love state.  you break it, you know.
[04:20] Stythys: esp. for getting others you're working with (project environment) to use it
[04:20] jesusabdullah: I like to spell it with an 8
[04:20] jesusabdullah: st8
[04:20] jamescarr: isaacs, it's often the case that I get an html template and convert it to jade ;)
[04:20] isaacs: i see
[04:20] SubStack: jesusabdullah: ANARCHIST
[04:20] isaacs: i use ejs, because i grew up with asp and php
[04:21] Aria: jesusabdullah: That makes me think "Stacht"
[04:21] isaacs: i like just shoving sticky globs of code right into my html

[04:22] jamescarr: npm -g install html2jade 
[04:22] TheEmpath: lets say you have a shared object with properties that need to exist in the front end and back end... well.. you have the common traits of that object (properties, getter/setters)... when it is on the server, it has server traits (Mongoose methods) and common traits.. and when it is on the client, it has client traits (graphic controls, etc) and common traits
[04:22] isaacs: devaholic: nope.
[04:22] jamescarr: html2jade http://www,.twitter.com > twitter.jade
[04:22] isaacs: devaholic: i mean, i'm kinda being silly
[04:22] TheEmpath: its easy to do with JS as it is prototypical
[04:22] isaacs: devaholic: but i do actually like ejs
[04:23] boaz has joined the channel
[04:23] TheEmpath: but it requires an MVC+Sharing sort of thinking
[04:23] devaholic: isaacs: i like ejs for similar reasons
[04:23] TheEmpath: the good news is that the client literally downloads the same JS the server would use
[04:23] TheEmpath: and it runs it on the client for client needs
[04:23] devaholic: isaacs: html being html is one thing, but also because working on the front end, then the backend, then back again, sometimes a nasty blob of code is actually efficient
[04:23] boaz has joined the channel
[04:24] isaacs: devaholic: it's clearer what html comes out of it.  i've been writing html for 17 years.  i know it well.
[04:24] TheEmpath: so you only write models once and you write them for all contexts
[04:24] devaholic: yeh
[04:24] TheEmpath: im still formalizing it, but i think it will be spiffty
[04:25] isaacs: html is like the javascript of template languages.  not great, or even good, really, but it's what we've got.

[06:18] jesusabdullah: Yeah, you do, but you can USE it from javascript
[06:18] mscdex: blargh
[06:18] jesusabdullah: and it's only an npm install away
[06:18] chrisdickinson: mscdex: if they've laid out their library correctly, you should never even know
[06:18] mscdex: ACTION shakes a fist at coffeescript
[06:19] chrisdickinson: mscdex: what's the problem with just npm installing it?
[06:19] jesusabdullah: so, you can npm install cslib, and because of cslib's package.json it'll automagically install coffeescript for you
[06:19] mscdex: i don't use npm
[06:19] jesusabdullah: Why not? It's totally handy
[06:19] mscdex: i don't deal with packages that often
[06:19] jesusabdullah: it facilitates hella code reuse, it even locally installs things
[06:20] jesusabdullah: handles versioning
[06:20] chrisdickinson: cures leprosy.
[06:20] jesusabdullah: That too!
[06:20] mscdex: that might be true, but i can just as easily drop dependencies into ./node_modules
[06:20] mscdex: or whatever it's called nowadays
[06:20] jesusabdullah: but npm will do that *for* you!
[06:20] jesusabdullah: that's the best part!
[06:20] jesusabdullah: as of version 1.0 there aren't any shims!
[06:20] mscdex: i've been burned by npm in the past :p
[06:21] jesusabdullah: Probably pre-1.0
[06:21] mscdex: yeah
[06:21] jesusabdullah: it was rewritten
[06:21] jesusabdullah: fo'srs, give it a go again
[06:21] jesusabdullah: it got better
[06:21] chrisdickinson: ACTION seconds this
[06:21] mscdex: heh that reminds me of that line from monty python and the holy grail

[08:00] isaacs: well, i guess.. if it's not published.  you could also list it as a bundled dependency, then it won't have to go to the registry, but that's annoying in its own ways..

[08:02] isaacs: yeah, it gets a little deep.
[08:02] felixge: https://github.com/isaacs/npm/pull/1165
[08:03] felixge: what do you think about that one?
[08:03] isaacs: well, it *will* only allow changes in the minor version.
[08:03] isaacs: i think without ~, people will just shove >= in there
[08:04] isaacs: i think that referencing the url would be better than the version, though, your'e right
[08:05] bene has left the channel
[08:05] isaacs: if you're installing via a url,you probably want that.  that's a valid bug, for sure.
[08:05] isaacs: the only tricky thing is that i need to pass through the original arg that's used to install something.
[08:05] felixge: isaacs: yeah. my pull request is not related to that
[08:05] isaacs: i could see how that could be useful in other situations, thoguh
[08:05] felixge: it's for installing packages from the registry
[08:06] felixge: isaacs: yeah
[08:06] Renegade001 has joined the channel
[08:06] felixge: > well, it *will* only allow changes in the minor version.

[08:06] isaacs: sorry, patch
[08:06] felixge: my 0.0.1 - 0.0.9 modules change really quickly
[08:06] isaacs: 3rd one
[08:06] isaacs: righ
[08:06] felixge: I think the patch is in line with the spirit of semver

[08:07] Aiden has joined the channel
[08:07] TomY has joined the channel
[08:07] isaacs: but also, accdng to semver, anything goes in 0.0.x
[08:07] isaacs: so you also shouldn't have a 0.0.x as a dep ;)
[08:08] felixge: isaacs: ... : )
[08:08] isaacs: but yeah, i guess, no tilde on 0.0 is probably ok.  i certainly want it for 0.(>=1).x
[08:08] tbassetto has joined the channel
[08:08] indexzero has joined the channel
[08:08] brainproxy: isaacs: is it possible to use --dev flag with install such that it doesn't recursively install devDepndencies
[08:08] felixge: isaacs: afaik anything goes in < 1.0.0 in semver?
[08:08] brainproxy: i.e. it only goes one layer deep
[08:09] brainproxy: with devDeps
[08:09] isaacs: yes! i totally wanted that (the --dev for devDeps)
[08:09] isaacs: i came online tonight to implement that one ;)
[08:09] felixge: Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable.
[08:09] zackattack has joined the channel
[08:10] jbpros has joined the channel
[08:10] felixge: isaacs: so if we want to follow semver, 0.x.y versions should be bound directly to the version
[08:10] felixge: not with tilde range descriptor
[08:10] brainproxy: isaacs: okay, well I just noticed tonight when i made connect a devdep for a test harness thing for browser testing and in turn connect devdeps installed giant mounds of stuff
[08:11] boaz- has joined the channel
[08:12] isaacs: felixge: in practice, among most node programs, 0.1 is usually fairly stable until 0.2, but 0.0.1 is not stable with 0.0.2
[08:12] isaacs: that's been my experience anyway
[08:12] isaacs: i think mostly following ryan's lead with node, actually
[08:13] isaacs: 1.0.0 is considered the first "done" release, but 0.1.1 and 0.1.2 are expected to be at least mostly api-compatible
[08:13] isaacs: but 1.9 and 2.0 are completely different programs

[08:29] brainproxy: anyway I can get better visibility into why it's "invalid" ?
[08:29] isaacs: brainproxy: it means that the thing depending on it depends on a different version that's installed, or it's not a package, or has bad json

[09:35] secoif: what doesn't you get
[09:36] secoif: Viehzeug.
[09:36] tuhoojabotti: JSON mentioned!

[09:36] tuhoojabotti: :D
[09:36] SubStack: hey lookit: https://github.com/substack/jsup
[09:36] devaholic: probrem mentioned?
[09:37] SubStack: Viehzeug: JSON.parse() is just like eval() but only for data
[09:38] bosky101_ has joined the channel
[09:39] SubStack: isaacs: I am now taking all the low-hanging AST-related npmfruit
[09:39] isaacs: SubStack: nice
[09:39] Viehzeug: tuhoojabotti well.. i'm just writing vows tests for my rest application.. the rest server does nothing but calling JSON.stringify(something)+'\n' and writes it to the response
[09:39] SubStack: so many modules you can write when you can just slice and dice the AST
[09:40] Viehzeug: tuhoojabotti hoever when i read the response and use JSON.parse, it will parse it as a string
[09:40] tuhoojabotti: wot
[09:40] tuhoojabotti: JSON.parse parsing a string? How is that a problem?
[09:40] devaholic: npmfruit lol
[09:40] secoif: what do you mean 'parse it as a string'
[09:40] secoif: as it returns a string, or it reads a string
[09:41] devaholic: JSON.parse doesnt return a string
[09:41] noderfs has joined the channel
[09:41] secoif: Viehzeug are you sure you've actually got JSON data
[09:41] secoif: as in
[09:41] secoif: formatted correct.
[09:41] noderfs: Hi, does anyone know when the ubuntu packages get updated to the 0.4.10 version?
[09:42] sfoster has joined the channel
[09:42] Viehzeug: for example: when i feed it {"date":"2011-07-20T08:24:46Z"} it parses it to "{\"date\":\"2011-07-20T08:32:43Z\"}"
[09:42] tuhoojabotti: Shouldn't JSON.parse return an object?
[09:42] tuhoojabotti: Aah
[09:42] Viehzeug: (even when i repace the " with #)
[09:42] Viehzeug: (even when i repace the " with ' *)
[09:43] secoif: noderfs no idea but you could easily compile it yourself
[09:43] Viehzeug: tuhoojabotti when i replace " with ' the result for parse is "{'date':'2011-07-20T08:24:46Z'}"
[09:43] noderfs: This is the version in the package: 0.4.9-1chl1~natty1
[09:44] tuhoojabotti: Viehzeug: Well that's incorrect json anyways.
[09:44] noderfs: is there a big difference with 0.4.10?
[09:44] tuhoojabotti: .. JSON.parse('{"date":"2011-07-20T08:24:46Z"}');
[09:44] catb0t: { date: 03'2011-07-20T08:24:46Z' }
[09:44] tuhoojabotti: works
[09:44] secoif: works for me also
[09:44] TheJH: Viehzeug, sounds weird. maybe you're double-decoding the JSON or so?
[09:44] tuhoojabotti: Yeah
[09:44] tuhoojabotti: Sounds like that.
[09:45] secoif: double decoding or double encoding?
[09:45] tuhoojabotti: secoif: Double it all!
[09:45] tuhoojabotti: ;)
[09:45] TheJH: Viehzeug, could you paste some of the surrounding code somewhere?
[09:46] TheJH: secoif, right, looks more like double encoding
[09:46] tuhoojabotti: Yeah.
[09:46] TheJH: Viehzeug, some of the code that creates the JSON
[09:46] Viehzeug: TheJH tuhoojabotti that could be a point..
[09:46] tuhoojabotti: http://youtu.be/QtKs1m_SQgg
[09:46] tuhoojabotti: ":D"
[09:47] tuhoojabotti: I'm sorry, I just got my morning coffee.
[09:47] secoif: for a moment I thought youtube had launched a pastebin-like service
[09:47] tuhoojabotti: :D
[09:47] secoif: or perhaps he'd pasted code in a youtube comment
[09:48] tuhoojabotti: No it's just a vid.

[10:01] tuhoojabotti: Viehzeug: How does it look like just before JSON.parse?
[10:01] tuhoojabotti: Same?
[10:02] secoif: Viehzeug is it possible it's already an object
[10:03] secoif: ie
[10:03] secoif: topic.date
[10:03] secoif: works sans JSON.parse?
[10:04] Viehzeug: tuhoojabotti {"date":"2011-07-20T08:24:46Z"}
[10:04] tuhoojabotti: That looks like an object :D

[10:05] Viehzeug: tuhoojabotti gonna make a typeof test
[10:05] tsenga has joined the channel
[10:06] tuhoojabotti: Yes, it could be useful.
[10:06] Viehzeug: tuhoojabotti typeof says string
[10:06] TheJH: maybe it would be possible to create a "dev-warnings" module that messes with functions like JSON.parse and JSON.stringify and issues warnings?
[10:07] TheJH: (that is, when input types are wrong or so)

[10:11] tuhoojabotti: obviously.
[10:11] tuhoojabotti: as I demonstrated before.
[10:11] tuhoojabotti: :D
[10:11] TheJH: Viehzeug, would be a surprise if not
[10:12] secoif: Viehzeug did you try just topic.date?
[10:12] Viehzeug: tuhoojabotti sorry.. was a bit distracted (have to cook for the company today :D)
[10:12] TheJH: I'll write that module now.
[10:12] tuhoojabotti: secoif: typeof returned string so..
[10:12] secoif: I know, but, it, looks like an object.
[10:13] Viehzeug: maybe some encoding foo with the http body?

[10:29] tuhoojabotti: usually you save all the chunks and then do stuff.
[10:29] TheJH: Viehzeug, what do "console.log(chunk[0])" and "console.log(chunk[chunk.length-1])" say
[10:29] tuhoojabotti: afaik

[12:09] TheJH: what do you think about this? https://github.com/thejh/node-dev-warnings Just do require('dev-warnings') at the top of your main file and it will add some additional debug messages to JSON.parse and JSON.stringify (I'll add more if I find more stuff that you can easily do wrong and won't notice very fast)
[12:10] tuhoojabotti: Looks good.
[12:10] jetienne: TheJH: put README.md with example of such message and why it is usefull

[16:45] bentkus: I understand why one would use thread safe arrays, but whats the point of "async arrays"

[16:45] tjholowaychuk: we have one thread

[16:46] tbranyen: not according to google groups today

[16:55] guidocalvano: japj: I just want to know how I can get the lib in some node dir, knowing what that dir is
[16:55] japj: guidocalvano: you are building with wscript right?
[16:55] guidocalvano: japj: if I can get that done I can do the rest myself
[16:56] davidwalsh has joined the channel
[16:56] guidocalvano: japj: I create a dylib with another build system, and then link that with wscript
[16:56] japj: guidocalvano: it could be that wscript knows where it is going to install the .node file, so that would allow you to "configure with install dir" your 3d library
[16:56] japj: guidocalvano: ah
[16:58] japj: guidocalvano: wscript puts your binary node addon in build/default/ by default
[16:58] japj: guidocalvano: I think if you copy your dylib to that location it might work
[16:58] guidocalvano: japj: yes, but I need to know where npm puts the dylib
[16:59] othiym23 has joined the channel
[16:59] guidocalvano: japj: I'll try
[16:59] guidocalvano: japj: tnx
[16:59] japj: guidocalvano: I think building node addons is part of node-waf, npm is not involved in that perse
[17:00] jameson has joined the channel
[17:00] japj: guidocalvano: but storing a precompiled dylib inside your addon might prevent it to run on different systems, but I dont know if that is a problem for you
[17:01] gregpascale has joined the channel
[17:01] isaacs: guidocalvano: the custom is to name the blah.node file as the "main" module

[17:01] Draggor: node.exe: not enough storage is available to process this command.  I know what it's saying, but is this a known thing?  Ihaven't had that happen on my nix based node.
[17:02] guidocalvano: japj: it will be one tough install script (:, but first it has to work on my system
[17:03] japj: isaacs: I think this is about a dependency to a 3rd party lib from blah.node (and that 3rd party lib is compiled outside node-waf and needs to be put somewhere in order to be be resolvable by the OS executable loader)
[17:03] japj: or something like that
[17:04] guidocalvano: is there an environment variable set that states where node can be found?

[17:31] chrissilich: this could take a minute ;)
[17:31] brainproxy: also you need libssl-dev, but I'm not sure what it's called on rh derived linux

[17:32] chrissilich: the project is an iPhone app that needs to connect over 3g as well
[17:32] chrissilich: so i need a server accessible from anywhere
[17:33] mnaser: you can do your dev internally over wifi and local IP for the server
[17:33] mnaser: t
[17:33] brainproxy: maybe fulfill that requirement last, and do your dev and testing with virtual server on local network, e.g/ running on your local machine sharing its network connection via virtual box
[17:33] chrissilich: i have been using an EC2 instance for a while, but it was just a copy of someone else's AMI, so I wanted to learn how to manage the server myself 
[17:33] Xeon06_: Are there any rendering engines that can be used with node? I want to take "screenshots" of websites
[17:33] mnaser: then switch the IP to the public EC2 instance over 3g/etc, it would be the same at the end, and you'll be a lot less frustrated dev-ing internally
[17:33] mnaser: ls
[17:33] mnaser: oops
[17:33] brainproxy: I just think you're in for some pain if you try and do all your dev/learning on ec2 :/
[17:34] bbrandon has joined the channel
[17:34] brainproxy: heck, get a Linode VPS or a Rackspace Cloud Serve so at least it's persistent; iirc, if the ec2 instance reboots, poof!
[17:34] chrissilich: I'll definately move to a paid VPS later
[17:34] brainproxy: anyway, i'm being opinionated :)
[17:35] chrissilich: but for now EC2 is great, I was doing fine til I tried to set up a server from scratch

[18:06] tjholowaychuk: worth investigating we need something solid like that

[18:07] Prometheus: the RTD guys kindly put their sources on github

[18:10] Borgoluzzuo: TheJH: We have a C process using hiredis to publish to a channel over redis which node is subcribed to waiting for data

[18:14] chrisdickinson: also, I've hosted some node.js documentation on rtd, and it seems to work pretty well
[18:14] Prometheus: chrisdickinson: yeah, but you'd probably want this to be node focused :)
[18:15] chrisdickinson: Prometheus: I don't think there's anything specific to python about rtd -- it just so happens that most of the projects hosted on there are python

[20:54] japj: jonaslund: I'm looking at the master tree, but I just found it in the 0.5.1 tag

[21:00] japj: jonaslund: ok, that one is still present in https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/deps/uv/src/win/core.c#L125
[21:00] jonaslund: yeah i took a peek at master
[21:01] jonaslund: creating a github account now so i can comment on the bug

[21:16] wadey has joined the channel
[21:17] japj: context: I doubt it's easier on the compiler, since the preprocessor will handle that. it's more of an easier to maintain piece of repeatable needed code in a macro that way
[21:17] jonaslund: assuming the structs are identical, what should be done is to make the big chunks of code into a normal function and just define a couple of small wrapper functions
[21:18] jonaslund: however if the structs differ then the defines are "necessary"
[21:18] matyr_ has joined the channel
[21:18] japj: jonaslund:  the structs are different

[21:31] Tobbe: I'm trying to create my first npm module, a google reader oauth lib. I think I'm done with the package.json file. Is there any way to ask npm to parse it to make sure it's sane?
[21:31] isaacs: Tobbe: npm ls will yell at you if it's not :)
[21:31] isaacs: Tobbe: you could also run through `npm init` which is a pretty ok sanity check.
[21:31] __directory: npm just shook me down for lunch money (and stole my cigarettes)
[21:32] isaacs: __directory: that's because cigarettes areno good for you
[21:32] rhdoenges: npm loves you
[21:32] rhdoenges: npm just wants the best for you
[21:32] mnaser: giving my question another shot -- is there something in node.js similar to python for this:  "%d: printf like %s" % digit, string
[21:32] jesusabdullah: npm hasn't taken MY cigarettes yet
[21:32] __directory: oh great, now npm is hitting on my wife...
[21:32] jesusabdullah: though it's been nagging me
[21:33] jesusabdullah: "c'mon duude"
[21:33] jesusabdullah: "cancer sticks, maan"
[21:33] jesusabdullah: "and why are you writing malformed json fo'srs"
[21:33] isaacs: mnaser: console.log("%s: printf like %s", digit, string)
[21:33] isaacs: mnaser: there's also a `sprintf` module in npm which is more fancy-pants
[21:33] Tobbe: isaacs: I ran "npm init" to get most of what I have in my package.json now. But "npm ls" says, among other things, "npm WARN Invalid range in engines.node.  Please see `npm help json` ~v0.4.9" That is one of the things npm init generated for me.
[21:33] jerrysv: Tobbe: remove the v
[21:34] mnaser: well that was a lot simpler than i thought it would be, thank you isaacs, ill also check out the npm sprintf module 
[21:34] isaacs: Tobbe: hm... that should be allowed.  what version of npm?
[21:34] Tobbe: 1.0.15

[21:38] Tobbe: nice

[21:39] isaacs: Tobbe: yes.  npm will not publish them with your module unless they're on the "bundleDependency" list.
[21:39] isaacs: Tobbe: `npm install` (no args) will install them for you.
[21:39] isaacs: `npm install --save blah` will install 'blah' and also create a dependency entry for it
[21:39] __directory: oh that's nice
[21:40] Tobbe: and I should probably add node_modules to my .gitignore then, shouldn't I?

[21:43] isaacs: Tobbe: post an issue if it's not working.  it'd be good to have a flag to fall back to the old-style +-- and `-- or something

[21:56] TheJH: mnaser, "exports.list = function(cb){" as first line and "cb(results.pools)" instead of the return
[21:56] malkomalko: say you have a file you are requiring, and in that file you are opening up some connection, something async when it gets required... is there a way to ensure when requiring the file to wait for that async operation to be finished?

[23:08] Corren: jimmy: that article is quite old by now (09/06/2010)
[23:08] rhdoenges: tcurdt: is buffer.binarySlice() what you're looking for? you don't skip() around a Buffer
[23:08] Corren: I'm not sure it still has relevancy
[23:08] tcurdt: SubStack: it's reading a file on startup ... once ... no need to do that async ... makes going through the file easier
[23:08] rhdoenges: actually, just regular .slice works
[23:09] cjm has joined the channel
[23:09] rhdoenges: the only files you should read synchronously are files you cannot continue without for the remainder of the program -- configs, ~/.*rc, etc
