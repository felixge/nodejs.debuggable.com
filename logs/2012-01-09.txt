[00:27] SubStack: because require() caches its results
[00:28] teadict: what if I do...
[00:28] teadict: a normal require and use the exports function to run code
[00:28] davidban_ has joined the channel
[00:28] SubStack: I would just go the module.exports route or you could just put the file in bin/ and spawn() it
[00:28] teadict: so when I, in some file, do "require('thefile')" the code inside the exports function runs

[00:44] markq: I can't make up my mind on that one
[00:44] SubStack: markq: depends on what you're trying to do
[00:44] SubStack: on both sides is probably the best
[00:44] teadict: shouldn't it be both?
[00:44] teadict: the fact that there's the same language now in both ends is not excuse!
[00:45] SubStack: so that malicious users can't bypass your validation and also so that the validation can be super low-latency without a remote request
[00:45] SubStack: if you use browserify or a similar module you can probably use exactly the same validation file
[00:45] teadict: the second one is the most beneficial
[00:46] markq: well jquery is exposed to the client while mongoose is not

[01:46] eggers: yep. they don't even give me a progress indicator in the app store 'app'. feh
[01:46] coderarity: in the Node.js license, does "substantial portions" count copying the util.inherits function?
[01:46] Bedoya: we were interested in asynchronous IO, so we're considering several frameworks... 
[01:46] tim_smart: eggers: Hmm last I used the App Store it did. It was in the updates tab or something
[01:46] cmr: Bedoya: Node is entirely asynchronous, you don't need a framework for that.
[01:46] chapel: Bedoya: for consuming api's node is very good at it
[01:47] cmr: Bedoya: You could just use the http module
[01:47] eggers: under purchases. thanks :)
[01:49] Bedoya: great, I'll try that... In your experience can Node perform better than more "classic" frameworks (Play over Java or Scala, Tornado, etc)?
[01:49] tim_smart: Bedoya: Here is me using 'nest' to create a client that inter operates with the Gist api https://github.com/tim-smart/node-gist/blob/master/index.js

[04:53] secoif has joined the channel
[04:54] teadict: Shaunzie: yes, except I don't see res.render('layout') anywhere on express
[04:54] Shaunzie: teadict: you can also add custom helpers to access he res object and use res.locals to pass data into the view
[04:54] Shaunzie: teadict: res.render is passed into your route closure
[04:55] Shaunzie: teadict: app.get('/', function(req, res) {
[04:55] teadict: yes, but there is no route closure in express's app.js for the layout
[04:55] Shaunzie: teadict: when the / route is called the req and res parameters will be provided
[04:55] andrewfff has joined the channel
[04:55] teadict: is like hardcoded when it decides to use jade
[04:56] warz: express chooses the template engine by looking at the templates file extension
[04:56] teadict: or maybe I'm not understanding what you're saying...
[04:56] Shaunzie: teadict: the render function allows you to pass in an object that will get sent to the layout files
[04:58] teadict: I'm talking about the layout layout, the .jade file that is always used for rendering, despite what you choose to render in your express routes
[04:58] teadict: how do you send stuff to THAT layout layout?

[04:59] gavin_huang has joined the channel
[04:59] Shaunzie: teadict: you just need to pass data into the view the same way you would with any other view script to access it
[04:59] teadict: right, but there is no route rendering layout.jade
[04:59] teadict: because is the template engine layout
[05:00] teadict: as in godlike template
[05:00] zivester has joined the channel
[05:00] teadict: as in the one that has the DOCTYPE definition and etc
[05:00] teadict: in express you only have app.get('/', index); which yes, you can send stuff to index.jad
[05:00] teadict: e
[05:01] justin has joined the channel
[05:01] Shaunzie: teadict: the res object isn't a global that you can access. You can access it from route call back, dynamic helpers or middleware
[05:02] Shaunzie: app.use(function(req, res, next) {
[05:02] Shaunzie: you need to be able to access the res object in order to get something into the view layer

[05:18] chrisdickinson: hey, i was wondering if i could get some thoughts on this lightweight javascript dialect i'm working on. https://github.com/chrisdickinson/jabbascript
[05:19] jamescarr: heh, I'd be amused if someone created a javascript dialect called havascript
[05:19] marcello3d: it'd be funny if someone made a javascript dialect called coffeescript
[05:19] chrisdickinson: it only adds four things: jashkenas's lightweight class syntax (that desugars to ES5), multiline strings, and "strong binding" unary / binary operators.
[05:19] marcello3d: get it? coffee? java? :D
[05:19] chrisdickinson: haha
[05:20] RLa: i think people who like c-style syntax will never like to use coffescript
[05:20] marcello3d: chrisdickinson: how does this relate to the new stuff in es6?
[05:21] chrisdickinson: marcello3d: it's not strictly related. it's more of a reaction to some of the talk i've seen recently about the class syntax (and the "|>" operator)
[05:21] chrisdickinson: it's a little bit of a playground, really.
[05:22] marcello3d: got it
[05:22] Zamarok1 has joined the channel
[05:22] chrisdickinson: i used coffeescript for a couple big(ish) projects, then found myself rewriting all of it in vanilla javascript down the line. this is sort of a "lighter touch" approach to a javascript dialect.
[05:23] chrisdickinson: the binding operators are the things i'm least sure of, really.
[05:23] RLa: but more stress on designing usable apis not new languages :)

[10:04] booyaa: i think you're okay if you stick below that v0.6.x which is fine since all you want is this statsd stuff. caveat emptor

[10:05] gebi: lol why?

[12:15] Nuck: That's... Pretty shitty
[12:15] innociv: But the same random number can be made twice.
[12:15] Nuck: That's not nearly enough entropy
[12:16] Nuck: innociv: Just use a UUID generator module
[12:16] innociv: Any suggestions?
[12:16] maritz has joined the channel
[12:16] Nuck: No idea, but UUIDs are so many that you should never have any collisions
[12:16] Nuck: Unless, of course, you're hosting the RSVPs for an Intergalactic Kegger
[12:17] Industrial: use md5
[12:17] Industrial: ACTION runs
[12:17] Nuck: Industrial: lol
[12:17] Nuck: MD5 isn't *that* bad, but not nearly as universally unique as UUIDs
[12:17] Nuck: I mean, UUID has it in the name: "Universally Unique Identifier"
[12:17] innociv: Probably helpful that I mention I'm simply doing a "Guest1234" type thing for people who are listening but not logged in. It's not a major security thing.  Heck I could probably just do  var guestNum = 0;  on.socket('connect'.... guestNum = guestNum+1;
[12:18] innociv: But having random numbers looks nicer, I suppose.
[12:18] Nuck: innociv: Yeah, I think incrementing is probably easiest
[12:18] Nuck: I personally use incremented numbers on Redis, since I need shared state between all my servers
[12:18] innociv: Easiest, yeah, just doesn't look nice.  I could do a number number, and check if that one is already taken, but then that's searching through an array of hundreds/thousands.
[12:19] Nuck: innociv: Another trick I learned is that picking a random from 1 to whatever is 5 chars of base32 works too
[12:19] innociv: And because everyone is Guest at innitial connect, it'll increment rapidly...
[12:19] Nuck: That provides billions

[12:24] Nuck: So each character holds a LOT more value
[12:24] Nuck: 36 possible values compared to the 10 in Base10

[12:24] Nuck: innociv: It can, there's no uniqueness guarantee, but with 60 million possibilities, the likelihood is small
[12:25] Nuck: What I do is I actually recurse until it hits one that isn't taken.
[12:25] Nuck: Since I'm spitting into a database anyways
[12:25] innociv: I suppose since sockets are compared, not their name, there is no issue.
[12:25] maritz: zomg: it runs tests async and so setUp from test2 may be run immediately after setUp from test1, then test1 is run, then tearDown from test1, then test2. (for example, it's rather random due to the async nature of this)

[13:56] astropirate: deoxxa: link
[13:56] deoxxa: just about to pack it up and put it on github
[13:56] astropirate: okie
[13:57] deoxxa: it's a loose port of twig to javascript, kind of
[13:57] deoxxa: trying to borrow the best parts of hogan.js and dust at the same time
[13:57] astropirate: lol i was just looking at that, So long as its not in the dreaded coffeescript
[13:58] adambeynon has joined the channel

[13:58] astropirate: great
[13:58] davidsklar has joined the channel
[13:59] astropirate: hmm.. you know, i dont' think Twig itself is that great..
[13:59] astropirate: what makes it great is smyfony2
[13:59] astropirate: with its magic
[13:59] astropirate: like the asset()  embeded function or being able to call controllers from within it
[13:59] deoxxa: i really like the twig syntax and style, but that's mostly just jinja2

[14:02] deoxxa: well, i'm not a fan of some of the syntax
[14:02] deoxxa: but that's a small issue, not a showstopper
[14:02] deoxxa: the requirement for a client-side library is a bit of a deal breaker for me - i feel like the compiled templates should be entirely standalone
[14:03] astropirate: you can do that
[14:03] astropirate: precompile
[14:03] deoxxa: yeah but you still need dust-core
[14:03] flat: I keep getting Error: write EPIPE at errnoException (net.js:640:11), and Google's not helping me out at all. I want to edit net.js to debug this, but I can't find the file. Anyone have any ideas?

[15:58] astropirate: its unholy
[15:58] HardPhuck: lol
[15:59] deoxxa: zomg: that stuff only takes a couple of hours to get your head around - especially if you do similar stuff in other languages (hello, php)
[15:59] HardPhuck: unholy doesn't really convince me not to use it
[15:59] HardPhuck: especially because I like python's syntax
[15:59] zomg: deoxxa: true, although PHP wouldn't be the first language that comes to mind with features like that :D
[15:59] deoxxa: correct, but it was what i was using mostly before node
[15:59] deoxxa: heh
[15:59] zomg: But yeah, actually there are many nice resources for learning those nowadays
[16:00] zomg: not a long ago there weren't almost any which explained them in a nice and understandable way
[16:01] martin_sunset: Stupid question, sorry about that: in an express app where do I get the individual path segments, other than parsing the req.url

[16:05] deoxxa: the variable shadowing thing
[16:05] secoif: how is that a reason to not use it?
[16:05] joshsmith: if you're open sourcing a project and use CS in that, then you make it more difficult for others to contribute
[16:05] secoif: it's just a feature you need to be aware of
[16:05] joshsmith: if you're running a company and use CS, you make it more difficult to hire
[16:05] wink_ has joined the channel
[16:06] martin_sunset: joshsmith: Come on, a JavaScript coder can learn coffeescript in two days
[16:06] zomg: joshsmith: that's sort of like saying if you're opensourcing a project using <any language here> you make it difficult for others to contribute
[16:06] deoxxa: secoif: i don't like that it removes functionality from js
[16:06] HardPhuck: martin_sunset: agreed
[16:06] joshsmith: true enough, but that's two days not spent working on your project, and the possibility that people will shy away simply because of it
[16:06] secoif: joshsmith any JS dev that is keeping up with times, should be well versed in both IMO, and shouldn't be such a victim of the CS FUD
[16:07] HardPhuck: joshsmith: if i wanted a developer and he would be intimidated by CS then I don't need him
[16:07] secoif: joshsmith it takes < 3 days to get up to scratch with CS 
[16:07] zomg: joshsmith: because that's a huge amount of time compared to the possible improved efficiency writing CS instead of JS gives? :)
[16:07] zomg: I'm not saying it's definitely better but just as another point of view

[16:08] zomg: but then I used it and it's not bad at all

Any ideas what to look for, try out?
[16:27] secoif: teadict I remember it just seemed like a lot of bloatiness I would prefer to roll myself. The view layer is useless, so you're down to classes, models and collections. I didn't get a lot of benefit from that so I just dumped it.
[16:27] teadict: secoif: what did you do for structure on the client then?
[16:27] secoif: teadict backbone on the client, just not on server.
[16:27] teadict: secoif: oh oh... yes, that's what I'm going for
[16:28] teadict: I thought you meant you didn't liek the library over all

[16:28] deoxxa: jzaefferer: any reason you're using .end instead of .send?
[16:28] fzzzy has joined the channel
[16:29] astropirate: teadict: where backbone shines is how it integreates with DOM events so you dont' have jumbled code, I tried using it with a non-dom JS related project  and it revealed no benifits at all
[16:29] secoif: teadict I still don't really care for the classes, and I lean a bit more towards Spine.

[16:32] teadict: maybe I'll be able to use some mongo later for somethings but I can't rely on that now
[16:32] secoif: teadict isn't Sequelize an orm of sorts
[16:32] jzaefferer: deoxxa secoif: okay, so that's not it. Anything else I might be doing wrong? not calling writeHead(200) seems fine, as that'll happen implicitly
[16:33] teadict: yes, for mysql/postgre
[16:33] secoif: as in, doesn't it give you your model layer
[16:33] teadict: yes, btu for the server...
[16:33] teadict: I want to reflect those models on the client
[16:33] teadict: so I have structure
[16:33] astropirate: teadict: yah if you are using sequalize, there is no need to add the complexity that backbone is going to add
[16:33] teadict: isn't backbone the way to go for that?
[16:33] secoif: teadict yeah use backbone on the client for sure

[16:44] VladGh has joined the channel

[17:03] markq: in short node uses "ses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices."
[17:03] blueadept: secoif: ah cool

[17:03] blueadept: try it out

[17:04] larsschenk has joined the channel
[17:04] mirovengi: but i feel like we're reinventing the whell
[17:04] mirovengi: *wheel
[17:04] markq: this is making a new wheel
[17:04] blueadept: its javascript
[17:04] markq: brand new wheel
[17:05] blueadept: ^
[17:05] markq: in terms of processing
[17:05] blueadept: no baggage
[17:05] mikrosystheme: not new. rounder.
[17:05] mirovengi: so it all comes down to a desire to use javascript over something else?

[17:06] larsschenk1 has left the channel
[17:06] case_: mirovengi, in fact, node.js may or may not be the best option for you depending of what you want to do...
[17:06] mikrosystheme: mirovengi: why you asking? what is your mission? what you are confortable with?
[17:07] mirovengi: i'm asking because i don't understand, my mission is to be able to explain to cs students in my department why they should or shouldn't consider nodejs

[17:07] blueadept: in particular: http://substack.net/posts/b96642/the-node-js-aesthetic
[17:07] case_: mirovengi, i'm using node.js because i'm coding a realtime application using websockets, i won't if I had to setup a "classic" website.

[17:08] mikrosystheme: cs students? they should consider because it is a nice tool to add to their toolbox
[17:08] secoif: mirovengi plus because node is fresh, it's able to learn from the mistakes of other tech ecosystems
[17:09] secoif: mirovengi node's package manager, npm is a big drawcard

[17:11] secoif: mirovengi javascript runs everywhere. If you're looking to teach your students something they can actually use, javascript is pretty much the uberlanguage (for anything to do with the web anyway).

[17:14] deoxxa: justicefries: what's your setup for basic CRUD stuff on node?
[17:14] mirovengi: i can kinda get case_'s example, but still don't wholely get it

[17:16] mirovengi: *just not hip
[17:16] nrstott: Node.JS is more of a DSL for building servers.
[17:16] justicefries: deoxxa: right now we're playing with some different approaches. on my personal site, using mongoose with express...trying to figure out a sane way to do it with node-postgres, going down both the road of doing it purely functionally and also trying to build 'models' with it.
[17:16] nrstott: like Ruby is a DSL for building web apps
[17:16] justicefries: s/Ruby/Rails
[17:16] case_: mirovengi, what would you use to build a websocket (say, chat) server ?
[17:16] nrstott: yes :)
[17:16] justicefries: Ruby is very general purpose. :)

[17:18] deoxxa: justicefries: mmm, i'm trying to figure out a good set of libraries to do basic crud stuff - i think mongodb is where it's at for flexibility for that kind of thing
[17:18] justicefries: deoxxa: I think it is too.
[17:18] c4milo has joined the channel
[17:18] justicefries: We're in a setting where postgres is 1) already there and 2) makes better sense for the type of data
[17:18] deoxxa: yeah
[17:18] justicefries: and there's no ORM around it, which I'm okay with
[17:18] justicefries: but organization is still in flux.

[17:19] deoxxa: i've got a system at work that makes mongodb, mysql, postgresql, sqlite and some external APIs all look the same from the reading side, so that's the "R" in "CRUD" figured out...
[17:19] mikrosystheme: mirovengi: that's fine.
[17:19] justicefries: mirovengi: play around with now.js as a good intro to real time stuff, and you'll see the power inherent in a single language.
[17:19] deoxxa: there's simply not enough hours in the day :(
[17:19] shinuza has joined the channel
[17:19] case_: mirovengi, em-websocket is like twister for python?
[17:20] mirovengi: i believe their similar but not exact
[17:20] dexter_e has joined the channel
[17:20] justicefries: case_: eventmachine is more like twisted.
[17:20] case_: mirovengi, i think JS does a vastly better job dealing with asynchronous tasks than {ruby,python} + async_lib
[17:21] case_: s/JS/node.js/
[17:21] case_: with more readable code
[17:21] justicefries: eventmachine/twisted/node.js are all equivalent patterns.

[17:21] nrstott: Node.JS has a lot of smart people working on it and there are many different ways to use it.
[17:21] mikrosystheme: i think you should use node.js if you like writing javascript.
[17:21] gk__ has left the channel
[17:21] mikrosystheme: that's it.
[17:21] nrstott: you can go with callback style, you can go with Promise style, you can do a lot of stuff with Node.JS
[17:21] mirovengi: case_: okay, that's what i was wondering, the appeal comes down to taste?
[17:21] nrstott: its a very sane environment that is quite flexible
[17:22] mikrosystheme: it is very performant when it come to I/O
[17:22] nrstott: try doing event loop programming using twisted then try doing it with Node.JS, I believe you'll prefer Node
[17:22] chadskidmore has joined the channel
[17:22] case_: nrstott, +1
[17:22] mirovengi: mikrosystheme, i've heard that but haven't found any numbers, do you have a link?

[20:33] nrstott: yawNO, it wont come up much... until you're really proficient just dont use it
[20:34] akter: Is it possible to execute a command (like child_process.exec) syncronously? I want to do it syncronously because it's during app boot, so async is not an option in this case.

[20:35] nrstott: process.nextTick should rarely be employed for that even
[20:35] yawNO: what do you mean by 'moving it to another process'?
[20:36] yawNO: calling nextTick?
[20:36] nrstott: no
[20:36] nrstott: write another process, another program entirely, that does your computation

[21:35] josephmoniz: you could use a more "fair" load balancing algorithm in another process like HAProxy
[21:35] josephmoniz: HAProxy supports load balancing based on distributing connections IIRC
[21:35] eshear: Yes, I'm using http://learnboost.github.com/cluster/ and creating 8 workers with fork. HAProxy (our old solution) is a non-starter for other reasons
[21:35] Juan77 has joined the channel
[21:36] EyePulp: eshear: what version of node are you running?
[21:36] eshear: (namely that if you use it in TCP-balancing mode you lose track of the IP address of the client, which is unfortunate in our application)
[21:36] eshear: We're running 0.6.6
[21:36] levi501d has joined the channel
[21:36] EyePulp: does cluster work under that version yet?  It's been stuck on 0.4.12 for a while...
[21:36] jonbaer has joined the channel
[21:37] quijote has joined the channel
[21:37] eshear: it seems to be working, the only issue we've seen is this weird thing where the load balancing seems to be biased. Also the docs I quoted are from 0.6.0, but there are docs for 0.6.6 for cluster - http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.6.6/api/cluster.html
[21:37] EyePulp: node has a built-in cluster module now (different in some ways similar in others to the learnboost one).  
[21:38] eshear: Yes, we're using the built-in cluster module
[21:38] EyePulp: ah - then you're not using the learnboost one?

[21:40] eshear: well, anyway, I'm using http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.6.6/api/cluster.html
[21:40] eshear: which hopefully looks like a link to the 0.6.6 node cluster documentation
[21:40] drostie has joined the channel
[21:40] EyePulp: anyhow - I've been using the new cluster too, and haven't yet got info on worker distribution.  Maybe you're not hitting it hard enough to get rollover?
[21:41] drostie: Any chance that crypto will be rewritten soon to use Buffers rather than 'binary' encoding?
[21:41] drostie: I could take a whack at it myself but C++ isn't one of my fluent languages and crypto tends to be sensitive. :x
[21:42] EyePulp: eshear: doesn't haproxy pass along the original IP as an additional header? "X-Forwarded-For" or something?
[21:42] eshear: Yes, in HTTP mode. Not in TCP mode, and we're not writing an HTTP server.
