[00:43] kevinSJ: Hi Guys, I need some help to figure something out. I've just started with Node.js and want to try something out. I've created a http request to my rails server. Is it possible to write data back to the rails server after making the GET?
[00:44] kevinSJ: At the oment I have this: https://gist.github.com/856887. Which just fetch the status and headers of my request.
[00:44] kevinSJ: Is it possible to send something back?

[00:53] doubletap: I have an example here: http://jsfiddle.net/doubleTap/fHgsQ/
[00:57] kevinSJ: Can some explain to me what write actually do? Let's say I make a HTTP-request to my webserver. At the moment I have this : https://gist.github.com/856887. What will write() do if I call it with a string as parameter before req.end() ?

[01:05] kevinSJ: Look at my previous posted gist to see what req is.

[01:08] kevinSJ: My first guess was back to the server, but I can't see any changes there

[02:20] Neil: express 1.0.7
[02:20] guybrush: right
[02:20] guybrush: thats the old one

[02:52] micheil: because, it'd be slower
[02:52] guybrush: Neil: glad i could help
[02:52] micheil: this way I'm loading everything up that I know that I'll need, so I don't actually have to hit the FS at request time
[02:53] AphelionZ: neat
[02:53] micheil: require() is a synchronous operation, and the only way node.js can be asynchronous is by having callbacks return as fast as possible
[02:54] micheil: so, require() would actually block your callback from returning
[02:54] marcello3d: it only requires once, though, at load time?
[02:54] marcello3d: app.get('/', require('./controllers/index').get) <- does the require once, not per request
[02:54] guybrush: right, you dont want to require() inside a route :)

[04:46] falconair: is there an even when a tcp server correctly starts listening (but before any client actually connects)? I don't see anything in 0.4.2 docs
[04:47] falconair: I want to start a server, when it listening, start a client...all within the same test.
[04:47] jtsnow has joined the channel
[04:47] mikegerwitz: falconair: I know that the the listen() method on http server has a callback as the 2nd parameter. Others may be the same.
[04:48] mikegerwitz: falconair: I just used that to do exactly what you're trying to do (test when listening) for an integration test for an http service a couple days ago
[04:49] falconair: mikegerwitz...yup, i should have been looking at the listen method rather than looking for events in 'net'...thanks!

[06:04] jesusabdullah: I was thinking about doing that email upload server thing
[06:04] jesusabdullah: I think I'd need to make a pop3 or imap implementation for node
[06:05] jesusabdullah: OPE
[06:05] jesusabdullah: one already exists!
[06:05] jesusabdullah: awesomesauce
[06:05] jesusabdullah: Open source is great!
[06:05] jesusabdullah: ow8

[06:07] mikeputnam: 00:02 < jeresig> Sitting by a roaring fireplace, watching Venture Bros with friends, installing an app I'm working on into the new No.de service. Yes.
[06:08] SubStack: fuck yeah venture bros
[06:08] jesusabdullah: gurl y u tweeting jeresig
[06:08] mikeputnam: i bet the signups for joyent just took a healthy spike
[06:08] JaMeSiTeGeN: Anyone want to help me make an OS from nothing but The-Linux-Kernel, Google's-V8 and openGL
[06:08] SubStack: I've been meaning to get into superscience one of these days
[06:08] jesusabdullah: Oh, HE tweeted!
[06:08] jesusabdullah: Superscience is great!
[06:08] mikeputnam: chya
[06:08] SubStack: build some walking eyes, you know
[06:09] JaMeSiTeGeN: and there dependencies
[06:09] SubStack: node-superscience, etc
[06:09] jesusabdullah: "...all the way to Phoenix!" "What's in Phoenix?" "Why, YO MOMMA STEVE"
[06:09] JaMeSiTeGeN: this is not #defocus
[06:10] jesusabdullah: wat
[06:10] JaMeSiTeGeN: this is not #defocus
[06:10] jesusabdullah: If you're sassing us for not being on-topic, you can gtfo
[06:10] SubStack: I'm actually hacking this node-ssh-server stuff
[06:10] SubStack: which is being very tricky
[06:10] JaMeSiTeGeN: node-ssh-server, I WANT!
[06:10] jesusabdullah: it's pretty SUPER as far as SCIENCE is concerned!
[06:10] SubStack: if you want it, you'll have to tolerate my random brain dump!
[06:11] jesusabdullah: SPEAKING OF, I'm working on science these days! I just made a wood box with foam in it.
[06:11] jesusabdullah: It's for my thesis.
[06:11] mikeputnam: sciencey
[06:11] SubStack: jesusabdullah: that sounds like such win
[06:11] JaMeSiTeGeN: Does anyone want to work with me make a javascript linux OS?
[06:11] SubStack: 'and for my thesis, I made... this box... with foam in it'
[06:11] SubStack: you know, for science...
[06:11] jesusabdullah: Hahaha
[06:11] jesusabdullah: Yeah :D
[06:11] JaMeSiTeGeN: jesusabdullah: Do you want to join?
[06:11] jesusabdullah: Oh, it's so bad too. I used a small skilsaw to cut these small panels so the tolerances are all outta whack
[06:12] jesusabdullah: JaMeSiTeGeN: What, js-linux? Naw, I like my lennox's as-is
[06:12] mikeputnam: annie?
[06:12] SubStack: jesusabdullah: you should've seen the abominations I kludged together for the underwater ROV
[06:12] jesusabdullah: Don't get me wrong, I love js, but I believe in a world where things are written in all kinds of crazy things all the time
[06:12] SubStack: I mean, I was using green threads
[06:12] jesusabdullah: :S
[06:13] jesusabdullah: Remember that green thread based networking lib for python?
[06:13] SubStack: That was a dig at threads, come on people.
[06:13] jesusabdullah: It confused the crap out of me
[06:13] jesusabdullah: and that's what I think of when I hear "green threads."
[06:13] jesusabdullah: is "really irritating python lib"
[06:13] JaMeSiTeGeN: jesusabdullah: JS-Linux is my little project (only draft right now) were it loads the linux kernel and boots into nothing but Googles V8 JS Engine and an OpenGL interface.
[06:13] SubStack: on that note, http://lesswrong.com/lw/jb/applause_lights/ 
[06:14] jesusabdullah: Hmm
[06:14] JaMeSiTeGeN: hmm === "yes" ??
[06:14] SubStack: I fear that my hatred of threads is becoming a cached thought :/
[06:14] mikeputnam: JaMeSiTeGeN: so...  Googles Chrome OS?
[06:14] jesusabdullah: I'm afraid I don't see the utility, JaMeSiTeGeN, but if that's what interests you then go for it. It may be more better than I think it will be.
[06:14] jesusabdullah: but I have thesis-ing, small side-projects and stackvm-ing that all take precedence
[06:15] JaMeSiTeGeN: mikeputnam: No not chromiumOS instead just a linux kernel and a javascript openGL interface
[06:15] SubStack: but then old people who I encounter have all of these similarly antiquated-sounding opinions
[06:15] unomi has joined the channel
[06:15] unomi has joined the channel
[06:15] SubStack: like one of my professors thought node.js sounded silly because he worked on a big evented project in C in the 1980s
[06:15] jesusabdullah: Another side project: A rudimentary game in node that I can run off my linode, so I can justify the cost
[06:15] jesusabdullah: It costs more than WoW!
[06:15] JaMeSiTeGeN: poweron -> coreboot -> payload (linuxkernel) -> Google's V8 JS Engine -> OpenGL interface -> Login in either a text-only /ui or the openGL GUI.
[06:16] SubStack: jesusabdullah: you should hack on hexhack for me!
[06:16] jesusabdullah: Indeed
[06:16] jesusabdullah: I need to fuck with the source again
[06:16] jesusabdullah: or, that is
[06:16] SubStack: since you know, I can't be bothered
[06:16] jesusabdullah: read into it
[06:16] JaMeSiTeGeN: jesusabdullah: How more info on my draft please goto http://typewith.me/RCUIqvqR7s
[06:16] SubStack: and hexhack will be a doubly powerful node.js demonstration since it will teach you node.js and javascript in the process of playing it!
[06:17] tmpvar: just got a rough hack working which is the glue between cluster and socket.io : https://github.com/tmpvar/cluster-socket.io/blob/master/index.js
[06:17] JaMeSiTeGeN: jesusabdullah: You left?
[06:18] jesusabdullah: Yeah JaMeSiTeGeN, it doesn't interest me.
[06:18] JaMeSiTeGeN: Can you atleast have a look, it does seem quite good after you look through it
[06:19] jesusabdullah: I'm not saying it's bad or anything, I'm just saying it doesn't light my fire.
[06:19] atiti has joined the channel
[06:19] jesusabdullah: It could be good for VMs
[06:19] jesusabdullah: make them more faster or something
[06:19] JaMeSiTeGeN: try instant
[06:20] jesusabdullah: I'll wait for the benchmarks, brah.
[06:20] JaMeSiTeGeN: somewhat as long as it takes to start a nodejs opengl canvas and draw to it
[06:20] zakabird: substack: (or whoever) im doing something with node running arbitary code (js, python)
[06:20] zakabird: any thought on security / sandboxing? googling doesnt turn up much for node
[06:21] Aria: Look at the vm module.
[06:21] marcello3d: chroot?
[06:21] SubStack: process.binding('evals').Script
[06:21] zakabird: seems it might be an issue for hexhack too...
[06:21] JaMeSiTeGeN: AAA_awright: Hello, Was I talking to you yesterday about a JavaScript desktop?
[06:21] Aria: But consider forking, setting ulimits, and using separate processes and unix permissions to lock things down
[06:21] SubStack: yeah I haven't written the vm code for hexhack yet
[06:21] SubStack: since you know I have this startup I'm building and all
[06:22] SubStack: incidentally I want to integrate hexhack with our backend
[06:22] SubStack: so we can have a control room in-game
[06:22] AAA_awright: JaMeSiTeGeN: I forget the exact conversation what else?
[06:22] SubStack: like the irc bot works now
[06:22] AAA_awright: Something about
[06:22] jesusabdullah: zakabird: There's a node-sandbox somewhere
[06:22] zakabird: thanks for suggestions. new to unix, so lots to learn. ex windows game dev...
[06:22] jesusabdullah: zakabird: I think maybe at github.com/gf3 ?
[06:22] jesusabdullah: oh snap
[06:22] AAA_awright: JaMeSiTeGeN: About a Javascript deskop? I don't think so
[06:22] jesusabdullah: zakabird: You should make sweet video games in node then!
[06:22] SubStack: goodness I am full of ideas tonight
[06:22] JaMeSiTeGeN: AAA_awright: Can you goto http://typewith.me/RCUIqvqR7s for the draft so we can continue
[06:23] jesusabdullah: zakabird: Make a game I can run on my linode to justify the cost. ;)
[06:23] marcello3d: jesusabdullah: this? http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.1/api/vm.html
[06:23] AAA_awright: JaMeSiTeGeN: No not anything like that
[06:23] JaMeSiTeGeN: Yes it was I remember, but it was less for the desktop
[06:23] AAA_awright: Is that what it was for? What were we talking about?
[06:23] JaMeSiTeGeN: more for a JS-Linux OS
[06:23] jesusabdullah: marcello3d: Oh Nelly! I haven't been following the add-ons too well
[06:23] jesusabdullah: zakabird: Did you see that? node 0.4 has a vm apparently
[06:24] zakabird: yeah,  that'd be fun. first step web app->node->blender etc
[06:24] JaMeSiTeGeN: AAA_awright: Pritty much
[06:24] AAA_awright: JaMeSiTeGeN: Something about V8 embedding
[06:24] JaMeSiTeGeN: yea
[06:24] AAA_awright: Ah hm.
[06:24] SubStack: oh nice you can just require('vm') now
[06:24] jesusabdullah: aww yea
[06:24] SubStack: back in the before-time you'd have to process.binding('evals')
[06:24] Aria: Woot! I've got my node embedding actually running a script and calling back into the API around node.
[06:25] zakabird: yeah, im gonna reasearch it. right now I want full fs and exec on my local machine anyway so not a pressing issue
[06:25] JaMeSiTeGeN: AAA_awright: So what do you think of this idea? http://typewith.me/RCUIqvqR7s
[06:25] jesusabdullah: I never really did windows dev. Is it as painful as I imagine?
[06:26] Aria: Depends on what parts. the older Windows APIs are hell -- handles and such. But the new stuff is much nicer. Not what I'd call awesome, but tolerable.
[06:26] JaMeSiTeGeN: You can type in the document, it is editable, and I will see it live :)
[06:26] jesusabdullah: I see.
[06:26] AAA_awright: JaMeSiTeGeN: Is this a kernel mod?
[06:27] AAA_awright: V8 in the kernel is... Interesting?
[06:27] JaMeSiTeGeN: AAA_awright: You can type in the document its self
[06:27] JaMeSiTeGeN: and there is a chat on the right
[06:27] AAA_awright: Yeah
[06:27] JaMeSiTeGeN: talking there in the chat
[06:28] zakabird: windows dev is so outside the coolness now, imho
[06:29] AAA_awright: JaMeSiTeGeN: This is looking a bit like Chrome OS
[06:29] zakabird: hopefully it dies at some point, but I guess not anytime soon
[06:30] zakabird: JaMeSiTeGeN: opengl ui from scratch is huge project by itself isn't it?
[06:30] JaMeSiTeGeN: AAA_awright:  not quite. This is aimed at instant boot, and the whole project being written in pure javascript. (Node-like/based) and chromiumOS isn't using javascript for chromium-browser it is in C
[06:31] AAA_awright: JaMeSiTeGeN: What difference does language make if the features are there?
[06:31] JaMeSiTeGeN: zakabird: Yes that is acturally the main part of the project.
[06:31] AAA_awright: So... A Javascript window manager...
[06:31] JaMeSiTeGeN: AAA_awright: Simple, if it is all written in one language it is far easer to manage and deal with when compiling (Yes compiling js to binary)
[06:32] JaMeSiTeGeN: AAA_awright: More or less. :)
[06:32] zakabird: then perhaps target webgl, i.e. node+js powered ui
[06:32] AAA_awright: You don't really compile js to binary
[06:32] AAA_awright: That sounds more reasonable
[06:32] zakabird: that something I'm thinking about
[06:32] tmpvar: linux + gallium + wayland + node + node-canvas (glitz backend)
[06:33] JaMeSiTeGeN: Please read my draft for the idea at the link http://typewith.me/RCUIqvqR7s

[06:40] JaMeSiTeGeN: AAA_awright: So what do you think of the idea? 
[06:40] jesusabdullah: Well, first, because probably nobody is that interested in your idea (no offense).
[06:41] marcello3d: sounds like a lot of work for small gain?
[06:41] AAA_awright: It's big, and not particularly innovative
[06:41] jesusabdullah: mscdex: node-poormansmysql makes me laugh

[06:42] zakabird: anybody have any good book/site recommendations for learning 'higher order programming' with a javascript focus? I'm loving 'higher order perl'
[06:42] AAA_awright: JaMeSiTeGeN: It looks like your making a window manager like Gnome or whatnot
[06:42] zakabird: but perhaps should just knuckle down and learn some lisp
[06:43] Aria: <small>gnome is not a window manager</small>
[06:43] marcello3d: effing gnome
[06:43] JaMeSiTeGeN: More, yes somewhat like gnome but also to replace Xserver and also the ttys
[06:43] marcello3d: always so ugly
[06:44] JaMeSiTeGeN: humm, gnome can be ugly, thats why you add a theme, google LMDE for a really good theme, more really LM-10 theme
[06:45] marcello3d: sure
[06:45] marcello3d: *continues to not using linux*
[06:45] AAA_awright: Aria: ...What is it then?
[06:46] JaMeSiTeGeN: ACTION Continues to use LMDE
[06:46] Aria: A desktop environment? A user environment?
[06:46] AAA_awright: What do you think is providing the fancy themes, menu bars, etc
[06:46] AAA_awright: Fine, desktop enviornment
[06:46] Aria: Metacity and Compiz are window managers.
[06:46] Aria: And Metacity at least is a relatively tiny program ;-)
[06:47] AAA_awright: Those are visual effects for your Gnome I thought
[06:47] JaMeSiTeGeN: And I want OpenGL to be the window manager and the desktop env and even Everything you see.
[06:47] AAA_awright: In any case that's what JaMeSiTeGeN appears to be doing
[06:47] JaMeSiTeGeN: The whole thing being a canvas
[06:47] Aria: No, those are window managers. Though compiz is happy to manage them into wobbly visual spectacles.
[06:47] mikeal has joined the channel
[06:47] razvandimescu has joined the channel
[06:47] JaMeSiTeGeN: Just wondering how exactly can I have an OpenGL canvas without Xserver? What in JS can I do?
[06:48] Aria: (And Metacity manages compositing, too, though not with much fanfare.)
[06:48] JaMeSiTeGeN: can OpenGL do it? with a little hack I hope?
[06:48] Aria: JaMeSiTeGeN: OpenGL is just an API. There are implementations that draw to other things than X windows. Look up Wayland.
[06:48] Aria: Also, OpenGL is not optimal for two dimensional drawing.
[06:49] Aria: .oO(How do you think most of those fancy new phones draw on screen? Not via X...)

[07:36] JaMeSiTeGeN: eMyller: Hi
[07:36] eMyller: i'm trying to install npm since some hours ago
[07:36] eMyller: i've compiled and installed node successfully
[07:36] JaMeSiTeGeN: What method are you using, What commands?
[07:36] JaMeSiTeGeN: What version of node?
[07:36] eMyller: master @ github
[07:37] JaMeSiTeGeN: What does `which node` give you?
[07:37] eMyller: but running node ./cli.js install on npm dir gives me a traceback-less "segmentation fault"
[07:37] JaMeSiTeGeN: What does `node --version` return?
[07:37] eMyller: /usr/local/bin/node
[07:37] eMyller: v0.5.0-pre
[07:37] JaMeSiTeGeN: kk and `node --version`
[07:37] JaMeSiTeGeN: good
[07:38] JaMeSiTeGeN: And what command are you using to attempt to install npm?
[07:38] sechrist has joined the channel
[07:38] eMyller: i just cloned the npm repo, cd'ed into the dir and ran $ node ./cli.js install npm
[07:38] eMyller: also tried $ make install
[07:39] eMyller: any of the choices listed at the readme leads me to a segmentation fault
[07:39] JaMeSiTeGeN: eMyller: Have you done. `curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh`
[07:39] eMyller: yea
[07:39] JaMeSiTeGeN: What did it do?
[07:39] eMyller: lemme try it again an get the output.
[07:39] JaMeSiTeGeN: kk
[07:39] sechrist: I hope nobody hacks npmjs.org
[07:39] JaMeSiTeGeN: paste
[07:39] JaMeSiTeGeN: !paste
[07:39] JaMeSiTeGeN: humm.
[07:40] JaMeSiTeGeN: sechrist: Me too.
[07:40] JaMeSiTeGeN: Wait too late, I did. :)
[07:40] sechrist: cracks rather*
[07:40] sechrist: has anybody found and reported any security vulnerabilities in node?
[07:40] JaMeSiTeGeN: Yes
[07:40] eMyller: JaMeSiTeGeN: http://wstaw.org/m/2011/03/06/plasma-desktopKA1641.jpg
[07:40] eMyller: just the same thing. :(
[07:41] sechrist: JaMeSiTeGeN: What were their nature? Code execution?
[07:41] JaMeSiTeGeN: Can I have the rest of the screenshot?
[07:41] JaMeSiTeGeN: sechrist: rm -rf / and yes
[07:41] JaMeSiTeGeN: eMyller: Can I have the rest of the screenshot?

[07:42] JaMeSiTeGeN: The whole screen would help

[07:49] JaMeSiTeGeN: Node and npm should be installed as root I say
[07:49] JaMeSiTeGeN: does not matter
[07:49] JaMeSiTeGeN: /usr/local is for everyone
[07:50] JaMeSiTeGeN: Your user does not own bash and you can run bash, correct..
[07:50] JaMeSiTeGeN: root ownes /bin and anyone can run anything from /bin

[07:55] eMyller: well
[07:56] eMyller: JaMeSiTeGeN: but the install was ran previously by root, so user couldn't uninstall
[07:56] JaMeSiTeGeN: I have used kde and know its quite powerful but I just don't like the feel

[07:59] eMyller: actually i dislike the way the gnome apps configs and interfaces are organized and integrated. (are they integrated at all? :P)

[11:55] kevinSJ: Here is the gist to the code: https://gist.github.com/857229
[11:57] stride: kevinSJ: displayed where and when?
[12:00] FireFly has joined the channel
[12:01] kevinSJ: stride, that what I haven' figured out yet. will it write data back to the server I did the request to? Or what will actually happend when I cann req.write() ?
[12:02] fly-away has joined the channel
[12:02] stride: kevinSJ: well, that gist doesn't really look right. here's a POST example in the docs http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.2/api/http.html#http.request
[12:03] stride: that will send a request to the server, along with the data you specify and call the callback (the function(res)) once the server answers to that request
[12:03] kevinSJ: Well the only think that's different there is that they make a POST-request to www.google.com right?
[12:04] stride: yeah, but that's essential, you don't send body data with a GET request (which is what your gist does)

[12:07] seivan_ has joined the channel
[12:07] kevinSJ: stride, exactly. That's what Im looking for
[12:07] stride: http://blog.frankgrimm.net/2010/11/howto-access-http-message-body-post-data-in-node-js/
[12:07] stride: essentially you get a request on the server side that has data and end events you can process to get that data block
[12:09] DrStrange has joined the channel
[12:10] kevinSJ: stride, Okey I'll look into it. Does it matter that my http-server isn't created by node.js. It's an Rails application
[12:11] stride: oh, only in the sense that the blog post won't help you then :)
[12:12] stride: but the technique should be similar in ruby
[12:14] kevinSJ: stride, Okey. So I actually need to fetch the request with Ruby after I write something back.
[12:15] kevinSJ: If I understood the blog post correctly
[12:15] stride: sure, your gist sends something to your ruby/rails/whatever http server and you'd have to process that there

[13:42] eventi: nice - looking for something that'll be easily configuratble to add new pattern/response pairs
[13:42] SubStack: so you can hot-swap the code without join/part spamming

[15:46] marcello3d: should probably push my latest tohugh
[15:46] marcello3d: lots of new changes
[15:46] bingomanatee: what do you use in its stead?
[15:47] bingomanatee: I've had a lot of people steer me towards c libraries for Mongo that simply don't work - this was during 0.2/3x though. 
[15:47] marcello3d: what do you mean?
[15:47] aklt has joined the channel
[15:47] bingomanatee: if you don't depend on native do you write your own c bindings to Mongo?
[15:47] marcello3d: I do depend on it
[15:47] marcello3d: but there are a lot of random bugs in it...the code isn't really well written
[15:48] marcello3d: I probably only use 15% of mongodb-native now
[15:48] marcello3d: the bson encoding/decoding and the command serializing
[15:49] bingomanatee: I'm giving mongoose a shot. So far so good. 
[15:49] marcello3d: mongoose is too high level for me, though
[15:49] marcello3d: I want raw access to the mongodb structures
[15:50] bingomanatee: I already started with native - I'm glad I did - as you said I wouldn't want to depend on a high level interpreter - but its good for quick "sketchouts". 
[15:50] marcello3d: well
[15:50] cjavapro has joined the channel
[15:50] bingomanatee: Also I do in general like to have the OPTION of schemas to document my work. It does seem tough that mongoose gives you no option of NOT using schemas

[15:52] marcello3d: yea
[15:52] marcello3d: ok

[16:28] mscdex: overkill?
[16:28] marcello3d: bingomanatee: probably not, it's too early stage, I'm still pretty new to mongodb so I don't want to make it out to be more than it is
[16:28] bingomanatee: less is more. 
[16:28] bingomanatee: Can you do time trials neck to neck with Mongoose just to show the point of it all?
[16:29] marcello3d: I'm not super familiar with mongoose, either, so it'd be an unfair comparison
[16:29] bingomanatee: Mongoose is pretty much a blunt instrument. If you fallow the howTo on the front page you'll be giving it a fair shot. 
[16:30] bingomanatee: It's an ORM, after all. 
[16:30] marcello3d: right
[16:30] marcello3d: well, I imagine mongoose could be implemented on top of mongolian, if one so desired
[16:30] bingomanatee: I could re-engineer your tests in mongoose if you like but I'm just 15 minutes ahead of you myself.

[16:31] marcello3d: a better comparison would be mongodb-native to mongolian
[16:31] bingomanatee: Thats what I was going to say. 
[16:31] bingomanatee: That would be an intersting proof of concept.
[16:31] marcello3d: but I haven't profiled or optimized any of the code, so any speed gains would be purely due to mongolian having less code
[16:31] bingomanatee: After all, Mongoose is a superset of native, so it can't by definition be faster than native. 
[16:31] bingomanatee: That is kind of the point isn't it?
[16:32] marcello3d: I don't think superset is the right word, but I get the idea
[16:32] marcello3d: well, no, the point is a better API for developers
[16:32] bingomanatee: ah. 
[16:32] bingomanatee: Well if better is faster, no reason to be ashamed :D
[16:32] p0ns has joined the channel
[16:32] marcello3d: I don't know if it's faster. it's probably the same
[16:33] bingomanatee: Thats what I tell my women. "No, honey, I'm better BECAUSE I'm faster!"
[16:33] marcello3d: ;D
[16:33] bingomanatee: Anyway - if you want me to mini-present mongolian, just give me a cheat sheet and I will.

[16:34] bingomanatee: or white paper your git.
[16:34] marcello3d: alright, sounds good :)
[16:34] marcello3d: I need to figure out how to document and test it
[16:34] marcello3d: I'm using rough jsdocs, but those don't seem to be super popular in the node.js world
[16:35] bingomanatee: I've had the doc compiler f**k up on me.
[16:35] bingomanatee: If you can just put up a statement of purpose etc. on the git that would help. 
[16:35] marcello3d: doc compiler?
[16:36] bingomanatee: why you did it, status quo v. mongolian, that sort of thing. 
[16:36] marcello3d: the statement of purpose is more or less in the Readme.md, if you think it's unclear, let me know which parts
[16:37] marcello3d: right
[16:37] mikegerwitz: marcello3d: To be honest, the documentation strategy I've seen in the node.js community is very, very poor, so don't be afraid to explore.
[16:37] marcello3d: hah. agreed
[16:37] bingomanatee: actually your readme is pretty good. 
[16:37] robotarmy has joined the channel
[16:37] bingomanatee: I'm doing an annotated superset of the node.js documentation - have not realesed it (have been getting slammed). 
[16:39] marcello3d: I'm also experimenting with no-semi-colon.js, which I'm sure a bunch of people will disagree with :)
[16:39] bingomanatee: Are you working at the moment?
[16:39] mikegerwitz: marcello3d: Well, does it remove semicolons?
[16:40] marcello3d: mikegerwitz: it's not a thing, it's just js without semicolons
[16:41] marcello3d: the only reason I've seen not to use them is http://stackoverflow.com/questions/444080/do-you-recommend-using-semicolons-after-every-statement-in-javascript/1169596#1169596
[16:41] bingomanatee: My last boss got into a wrong-thinging bitch fight with his system administrator over the definition of the semicolon.
[16:41] Chunk: after reading more it seems stomp is the best method for connecting to activemq from node
[16:41] mikegerwitz: marcello3d: JS's semicolon insertion can be the cause of some nasty bugs
[16:41] marcello3d: well
[16:42] marcello3d: my excuse is most libraries I've seen forget semi colons occasionally, so I don't think using semicolons everywhere helps prevent those bugs
[16:42] gozala has joined the channel
[16:42] marcello3d: and coming from java/scala, there's something 'freeing' about not using them :)
[16:42] marcello3d: (java requires, scala doesn't)
[16:43] marcello3d: here's an argument against semicolons, imo: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/444080/do-you-recommend-using-semicolons-after-every-statement-in-javascript/444200#444200
[16:43] marcello3d: if you write return (newline) 5
[16:43] bbttxu has joined the channel
[16:44] mikegerwitz: marcello3d: That's going to happen regardless of whether or not you use semicolons. That's one example of how JS's semicolon insertion mechanism mangles code that is otherwise perfeclty fine
[16:44] marcello3d: exactly
[16:44] mikegerwitz: er, wait, are you referring o the return statement?
[16:44] marcello3d: yes
[16:44] mikegerwitz: ok
[16:45] marcello3d: that's an example where adding semi colons everywhere will lull you into a false sense of security ;)

[16:47] marcello3d: that's basically your only option
[16:47] cainus: hard to believe
[16:47] marcello3d: unless you use another layer to manage the node js process
[16:47] cainus: right...that's what I'm getting at

[16:47] mhausenblas has joined the channel
[16:47] cainus: excellent :)
[16:47] marcello3d: what kind of remote are you thinking
[16:47] marcello3d: like a rest call?

[16:48] marcello3d: in what context are you trying to restart the process, is it an automated system?
[16:48] cainus: yeah I'd write a script to ssh in mayble
[16:49] robotarmy has joined the channel
[16:49] cainus: but I don't want it to have to grep ps to find the process, for example

[16:49] marcello3d: it has a repl you can telnet into and restart
[16:49] garrensmith: drudge: thanks just found it, should have done that before asking the question :-\
[16:50] mikegerwitz: cainus: I just use upstart and have a script SSH in and do $ service mynodeservice restart
[16:50] marcello3d: yea, you probably want your node running as a service
[16:50] marcello3d: then you can use init.d or whatever to reload/restart it
[16:51] cainus: mikegerwitz: upstart > forever? 
[16:51] marcello3d: I think they're different classes
[16:51] marcello3d: forever is a node.js module type deal, right?
[16:51] marcello3d: whereas upstart is a *nix service manager
[16:51] cainus: yeah upstart seems more general purpose
[16:51] mikegerwitz: cainus: I'm unfamiliar with 'forver'
[16:52] cainus: http://blog.nodejitsu.com/keep-a-nodejs-server-up-with-forever
[16:52] marcello3d: no point in reinventing the wheel though, I'd go for the unix solution over a node.js solution
[16:52] mikegerwitz: marcello3d: I agree
[16:52] cainus: yeah I think I do too
[16:52] marcello3d: as amazing as node.js is :)
[16:52] cainus: alright thanks guys... good info
[16:52] marcello3d: fewer pieces to maintain the better

[17:12] mikegerwitz: rather, npm just takes advantage of it
[17:12] augustl: mikegerwitz: well, it's originally npm style isn't it?
[17:12] augustl: I realize it's something node core supports though
[17:12] mikegerwitz: augustl: Oh, I'm unsure. I only began using npm about a month ago
[17:13] isaacs: augustl: what's the questions?
[17:13] augustl: if I have node_modules/mylib, require("mylib/foo") will load node_modules/mylib/foo.js
[17:13] bengl has joined the channel
[17:13] augustl: so that could work I guess
[17:14] malkomalko has joined the channel
[17:14] augustl: but having a  bunch of files in the projec root is dirty
[17:14] dubbe has joined the channel
[17:14] augustl: isaacs: I want to provide require("mylib/subthing")
[17:15] isaacs: augustl: ok.  that's possible.
[17:15] isaacs: as long as "subthing" is right in th eroot of "mylib"
[17:15] augustl: another way would be to have to require("mylib") first, which could modify require.paths
[17:15] isaacs: if it's in the "lib" folder, then do require("mylib/lib/subthing")
[17:15] isaacs: NOO!OOO!O!O!!!!!
[17:15] augustl: why not?
[17:15] malkomalko: lol
[17:15] isaacs: do not modify or depend upon require.paths mutations.
[17:15] mikegerwitz: augustl: If you don't want to dirty up the root, provide an index.js and then do require( 'mylib' ).foo
[17:15] augustl: I refuse to comply!

[17:16] isaacs: augustl: in 0.5 that will be deprecated.
[17:16] isaacs: augustl: it's also a terrible antipattern that makes horrible problems.
[17:16] augustl: the problem with require("mylib").foo is that I would have to set the foo property when mylib is required.
[17:16] marcello3d: how would one do the equivalent of Math.ceil( a / b ) if a and b are longs?
[17:16] augustl: isaacs: I see
[17:16] marcello3d: isaacs: did you see my nithub stuff from the other day? :D
[17:16] augustl: isaacs: mylib/lib/subthing is the best so far :)
[17:17] dubbe: Hello, i have some problems with node and couch. why does it do the res.forEach after console.log("save")... (code: http://pastebin.com/TJHpfBwg)
[17:17] mikegerwitz: isaacs: Well I wouldn't say it's an "antipattern" if used correctly..include path is used in plenty of successful cases, including $PATH :) So I don't agree with deprecating it, because someone may have all their libraries in a single path for their system, but I do think node_modules is the best route.
[17:17] bingomanatee: ACTION requires his libraries with absolute pathing if he can't rely on the node_modules folder
[17:17] augustl: agreed on antipattern - ruby does this all the time
[17:17] bingomanatee: and there's nothing you can do to stop me!
[17:18] isaacs: mikegerwitz: that'd be like modifying the NODE_PATH environment var
[17:18] augustl: doesn't npm support this in package.json? I.e. providing "mylib/foo"?
[17:18] mikegerwitz: isaacs: d'oh, forgot about that
[17:18] augustl: would be great if node itself supported that, it's very useful
[17:18] mikegerwitz: isaacs: Okay, I'm in agreement with you then :)
[17:18] isaacs: mikegerwitz: modifying the qrequire.paths modifies it for ALL modules, and makes your program not composible as easily
[17:18] isaacs: it's also a run-time modification vs a start-time modification
[17:19] mikegerwitz: isaacs: Yeah, NODE_PATH slipped my mind
[17:19] isaacs: augustl: it used to.  as of 0.3 it no longer maps the lib dir modules.
[17:19] isaacs: augustl: it just maps the package folder as-is
[17:19] augustl: isaacs: you can't set it up by hand either?
[17:19] isaacs: augustl: as i said, if you want mylib/submod to work, then put submod in mylib
[17:19] augustl: iirc you could do something like "mylib/foo": "./lib/foo"
[17:20] isaacs: augustl: yeah, that's the layer of indirection/complication that was removed.
[17:20] isaacs: augustl: it caused hard problems,and only solved trivial ones.
[17:20] marcello3d: top githubbed npms (from a few days ago): https://gist.github.com/854199
[17:20] isaacs: that's a bad trade-offi
[17:20] marcello3d: and keyword deathmatch: https://gist.github.com/854219
[17:20] augustl: so are you saying there's no way in node to provide mylib/foo, other than cluttering the root of the project?
[17:20] isaacs: marcello3d: oh, yeah, i saw that.  that'd rad :)
[17:21] isaacs: augustl: if you want clutter, then *you* have to manage it, yes.
[17:21] augustl: isaacs: I would gladly manage it via package.json
[17:21] isaacs: augustl: if you want order, then you must use it when you require() the module.
[17:21] isaacs: augustl: but you see, that clutters up npm.
[17:21] augustl: I'd argue it's worth it
[17:21] isaacs: and people who use your module have a harder time finding the code that they're loading.
[17:21] vuliev: dubbe: I think that it just executes asynchronously. If you want that to run after your res.forEach, put it inside that callback.
[17:21] augustl: "multiple main's" makes a lot of sense for some libraries
[17:21] isaacs: augustl: ok.  you won't be the first to argue that.  but the case is kinda settled.
[17:22] augustl: regardless, this is about node, not npm
[17:22] eventi has joined the channel
[17:22] augustl: mylib/lib/thing still seems like the best option
[17:22] dubbe: vuliev: yeah, i figured... i solved it by returning the id from the function instead
[17:22] isaacs: augustl: if you want your package's contents to be accessible, well, they are.
[17:22] augustl: another option wold be to have mylib.subthing be a getter that required. But that smells a bit too imo
[17:22] isaacs: augustl: but adding a layer of indirection and a bunch of extra shims and symlinks, just so that you can cut 4 characters out of your require() statements, that's not hte right trade-off.
[17:23] augustl: isaacs: exposing the lib dir seems a bit leaky imo
[17:23] augustl: it's an internal thing you might want to change
[17:23] isaacs: require.resolve should tell you exactly where the actual code lives.  in npm 0.3, it does.
[17:23] augustl: package.json's "main" property doesn't assume a lib dir
[17:23] augustl: you might want to change it in the future
[17:23] augustl: etc.
[17:23] d0k has joined the channel
[17:23] pcardune has joined the channel
[17:23] isaacs: augustl: so split the things up into separate modules, if you want multiple mains.
[17:24] augustl: perhaps most node libraries are rather small
[17:24] isaacs: require("foo-bar")  vs require("foo-baz")
[17:24] augustl: that is, not small, but have only one entry point, or whatever
[17:24] isaacs: augustl: or just require("foo/bar") and require("foo/baz") where bar.js and baz.js are in the root of your repo
[17:24] augustl: for the library I'm currently working on, it would be great to provide a metapackage, for example
[17:24] isaacs: it *should* feel cluttered to have a jillion entry points for your lib.
[17:24] isaacs: because that *is* cluttered
[17:25] marcello3d: isaacs: how would you suggest the goog module be done?
[17:25] augustl: I disagree that it's cluttered
[17:25] augustl: large, or voluminous, maybe ;)
[17:26] bingomanatee: ACTION semantically seperates his modules into organizational units that assert themselves into the core library on require. 
[17:26] augustl: say you're writing a test runner, for example. It have X number of output modules
[17:26] augustl: providing "my-test-runner/output-module-a" makes sense
[17:27] augustl: and you might have ten of these
[17:27] augustl: bingomanatee: I don't want to force users to load all the test runners into memory, though
[17:27] augustl: if I understand you correctly
[17:27] augustl: s/it have/it has/
[17:27] bingomanatee: then subsume the loading til you need them. 
[17:27] bingomanatee: one sec I will gist
[17:28] augustl: perhaps I could write a myTestRunner.loadOutputModule("a") kind of thing
[17:28] isaacs: augustl: sure.
[17:29] isaacs: augustl: there are still a lot of ways to write programs.
[17:29] bingomanatee: check out https://github.com/bignomanatee/noogle/blob/master/models/pages.js
[17:29] augustl: that feels a lot like circumventing missing core functionality
[17:29] augustl: perhaps I'm too used to ruby gems ;)
[17:29] isaacs: these problems are very solveable without auto-symlinking into the depths of your package folder

[17:30] augustl: isaacs: require() could read package.json and traverse the file system manually?

[17:30] isaacs: no.
[17:30] isaacs: augustl: no, that's not a good idea.  the nodey solution here is to simplify the spec, and remove the bits that are unnecessary
[17:31] isaacs: we tried it.  it's a pita.  movign on.
[17:31] augustl: an easy getaway argument. "it's nodey!"
[17:31] isaacs: the nice thing about the current solution is that you get compartmentalized dependencies, with a require() algorithm that fits nicely in a few paragraphs.
[17:31] marcello3d: isaacs: how would I go about integrating nithub into search.npmjs.org ? is the search page source somewhere?
[17:32] augustl: but if this is something that isn't interesting to have in node, I'll just write it myself
[17:32] isaacs: marcello3d: search.npmjs.org is a couchapp
[17:32] isaacs: marcello3d: it's source code is at http://github.com/isaacs/npmjs.org
[17:32] marcello3d: I don't know any couch
[17:32] isaacs: augustl: that's another reason it shouldn't be in node-core.  putting something that fancy in node-core prevents people from doing it on their onw.
[17:32] marcello3d: do I need to run a couch server to test mods?
[17:32] isaacs: augustl: i cherish your enterprising spirit!!
[17:32] isaacs: :)
[17:33] isaacs: marcello3d: yeah.  it's not very hard.
[17:33] augustl: isaacs: it's a thing people aren't interested in doing on their own
[17:33] isaacs: marcello3d: the trickiest bit is breaking your brain to map-reduce and view logic that is a thin js wrapper around erlangs insanity
[17:33] augustl: but again, I might be too influenced by ruby gems
[17:33] augustl: there we just add lib/ to the load path ;)

[17:36] marcello3d: does registry.npmjs.org support not modified/if-modified-since etc?

[17:36] marcello3d: if I wanted to keep an up to date local copy
[17:36] marcello3d: ok
[17:36] marcello3d: that also works
[17:36] isaacs: marcello3d: if you set up a couchdb, you can just replicate from it, and it'll do all that for you smartly, compare hashes etc.
[17:37] isaacs: since the etag is deterministically generated from the data, you don't end up fetching anything that is already there.

[17:38] dans has joined the channel
[17:39] augustl: so if main is "lib", require("mything/foo") will load lib/foo.js?

[17:40] augustl: hmm no, it doesn't
[17:41] augustl: mikegerwitz: yeah, I was hoping require("mything/foo") would then also require lib/foo.js (given "main" is set to lib)
[17:41] augustl: isaacs: does that make sense to you?
[17:41] isaacs: augustl: no, that's not how it works.
[17:41] isaacs: main is a module.
[17:41] isaacs: not a stem
[17:42] augustl: I'm talking about how it might work, not how it works now
[17:42] isaacs: it's specifically designed to prevent the ruby insanity
[17:42] augustl: if you want to provide a bunch of modules with your project, set "main" to a folder, done.
[17:42] pauls has joined the channel
[17:43] augustl: not sure how clean the implementation would be, though. (Since that seems to be an important argument)
[17:43] isaacs: if you want to do something that doesn't make sense as having a single-module entry point, then structure your package the way you want require() to work.
[17:43] isaacs: the real issue is:  i do require("foo/bar").  i didn't write foo.  i want to see that code.  which file do I open?
[17:43] isaacs: vim ./node_modules/foo/bar<tab><enter>
[17:43] augustl: open package.json, find the directory, have lunch
[17:44] augustl: it's either bar.js or whatever-main/was-set/to/bar.js
[17:44] augustl: not that hard, really
[17:44] isaacs: it adds an additional level of indirection.
[17:44] augustl: require is magical already ;)
[17:44] augustl: require("foo") is also ambigous
[17:44] isaacs: yeah, and that's not great.
[17:44] augustl: could be index.js, or main in package.json
[17:45] isaacs: that's a compromise already
[17:46] augustl: compare the use cases, though
[17:47] dve has joined the channel
[17:47] augustl: require is used a lot. Opening/editing the files you required not so much.
[17:47] jimt_ has joined the channel
[17:47] augustl: hence I'd argue that making require awesome should get priority
[17:48] augustl: and when you have require("mylib/x"), where x can be 10 different things, the project directory for mylib will look retarded.
[17:49] stagas has joined the channel
[17:49] augustl: ..the way things are currently
[17:49] augustl: so, let people set "main" to a directory, problem solved.
[17:49] augustl: and the problem it causes - ambiguity of actual file location - is minor in comparison, imo
[17:49] augustl: mailing list time, I suppose.
[17:49] mikegerwitz: Honestly I'd argue that require should only look at node_modules, index.js and NODE_PATH. Why was package.json considered for require()? There's too much going on.
[17:50] augustl: mikegerwitz: because specifying the location of t he actual file you require is damn convenient :)
[17:50] augustl: I have a feeling 99% of node libraries have "./lib/libraryname" as main, though
[17:50] augustl: kind of broken
[17:51] mikegerwitz: I think s/node_modules/lib/ would have been a better option too, but oh well
[17:51] augustl: wait.. What was that? Was that the sound of "require should always look in 'lib' of the module"?
[17:51] augustl: mikegerwitz: node_modules is for dependencies, not library code
[17:51] mikegerwitz: Ahh.
[17:52] augustl: isaacs: what do you think about the idea of require("foo") looking in node_modules/foo/lib?
[17:52] augustl: then you could have foo/lib/index.js, foo/lib/subthing.js, etc
[17:52] isaacs: augustl: if node_modules/foo/package.json says that the main module is "lib" then that's where it will look, yes
[17:52] markc has joined the channel
[17:52] augustl: isaacs: not for foo/lib/subthing.js, though
[17:52] ceej has joined the channel
[17:53] isaacs: augustl: so, here's the problem with that:
[17:53] isaacs: require("a/b/c/d/e")
[17:53] isaacs: right"
[17:53] isaacs: assume that a/b/c/package.json specifies main:lib
[17:53] isaacs: not you have to load a/b/c/lib/d/e
[17:53] isaacs: but, more importantly: you have to search every portion of the path every time for a package.json file.
[17:53] isaacs: and that sucks.
[17:53] augustl: sounds like an edge case
[17:53] augustl: most requires don't go two levels
[17:53] isaacs: augustl: easy for you to say
[17:54] augustl: you seem to be talking about require("some_library/a_dependency/foo")
[17:54] augustl: I'm sure you can find something bad with every approaceh
[17:54] isaacs: augustl: i'm talking about what's required for basic correctness, and how to avoid pathological behavior.
[17:54] augustl: approach*

[17:54] dthompson has joined the channel
[17:54] isaacs: everything that you'er suggesting is an enhancement on what's already in 0.4, right? builds upon it.
[17:55] isaacs: let's roll back to 0.4, get everything working there, and then start talking about the way forward, if it's actually necessary.
[17:55] isaacs: remember, not very long ago, there simply was no way to do any of this wihtout a lot of machinations and brittle bs in npm.
[17:55] nichdiekuh has joined the channel
[17:55] isaacs: qv: npm 0.2.x
[17:56] augustl: isaacs: in practice, I did this before node 0.4
[17:56] augustl: with npm
[17:56] isaacs: augustl: right, but there were quite a few edge cases, more common than you probably realize, that led to subtle and awful breakage.
[17:56] augustl: that's interesting
[17:57] augustl: require("mylib/subthing") is impossible to implement because of unforseen edge cases?
[17:57] isaacs: but worse than any of that was the computer-rage that was caused when someone did "vim redis/index.js" and saw a bunch of generated code
[17:57] augustl: why didn't you just say that :)
[17:57] isaacs: augustl: come on, i'm not saying that.
[17:57] augustl: I thought you were
[17:57] isaacs: i'm saying that there are *actual* edge cases in the pre-0.4 npm-based implementation which you were using.
[17:57] augustl: subtle and awful breakage is pretty much the same as impossible to implement no?
[17:57] augustl: ok, not unforsseen, actual
[17:58] isaacs: augustl: unforeseen by the authors
[17:58] arnorhs has joined the channel
[17:58] isaacs: and not always easy to detect, either.
[17:58] isaacs: all the shims and symlinks are bad design.
[17:58] augustl: node doesn't use symlinks, though?
[17:58] matschaffer has joined the channel
[17:58] isaacs: npm
[17:58] augustl: ah, right
[17:58] isaacs: so we decided to look at what's actually necessary, and then design the simplest system possible to meet the greatest swath of use-cases.
[17:59] isaacs: and then put most of the require() logic in node itself
[17:59] mhausenblas has joined the channel
[17:59] augustl: I'll just finish the project as is, get famous and rich, and post on the mailing list with grand authority ;)
[17:59] isaacs: require("foo/bar") rather than require("foo/lib/bar") just didn't make the cut.  it's a minor use-case that's easy to do
[18:00] augustl: ..or settling with the current state of affairs, for all I know it's not that big of a problem to expose lib in the requires.
[18:00] razvandimescu has joined the channel
[18:00] isaacs: i guarantee you, writing a module loader is probably a lot more fun, but a lot more work, than altering your aesthetic reaction to "lib/" in your require() calls :)
[18:01] augustl: it's not as much about aesthetics as it is about API breakage
[18:01] extrastring has joined the channel
[18:01] augustl: but it's just another level of care - if you move stuff in lib/ in a ruby gem, you're doing API breakage
[18:01] augustl: in node.js, it's just one directory up - the project root.

[19:49] SubStack: eMyller: because it's MOAR FASTAR
[19:49] SubStack: than setTimeout(fn, 0)
[19:50] SubStack: actually setTimeout(fn, 0) doesn't even work in node :/
[19:50] marcello3d: why isn't setTimeout(fn,0) implemented as nextTick ?
[19:50] eventi: 1st rule of IRC is the first to reply is just to tell you how dum you r
[19:50] eMyller: SubStack: and why would i use setTimeout(fn, 0)?
[19:50] marcello3d: execute code on the next event loop
[19:50] eventi: ACTION kid eating mac power cable
[19:50] SubStack: eMyller: if you want something to execute something on the next tick of the event system of course
[19:50] eMyller: is it some kind of calback queuing?
[19:50] marcello3d: for example, on mongolian dead beef, I use it after I create a readable stream
[19:51] marcello3d: to give the caller enough time to call foo.on("data", ... )
[19:51] marcello3d: before I start actually reading data
[19:51] Bonuspunkt: ex: starting http-server setTimeout(/* make a request to http-server */, 0)
[19:52] eMyller: so, if i create an event, i should bind all listeners to it inside a nextTick callback?
[19:52] jimt has joined the channel
[19:52] marcello3d: very bizarre, I can't figure out what the default levels available on winston are..!
[19:53] eMyller: marcello3d: then you do nextTick(startStreaming)?
[19:53] marcello3d: eMyller: yep
[19:53] marcello3d: er, no to your first question
[19:54] marcello3d: you should bind the listeners as soon as possible
[19:54] eMyller: an event should have a .start() thing
[19:54] eventi: marcello3d: what's winston?
[19:54] marcello3d: basically the problem is this: if my streaming method is somehow magically synchronous, rather than asynchronous
[19:54] softdrink has joined the channel

[19:57] marcello3d: or if I want to make a socket.io viewer, no problem
[19:58] eventi: not that I don't see the benefit, but i think you should log with something other than node... How will you log things that prevent it from logging?

[20:05] marcello3d: I use intellij for all my development (including node.js)
[20:06] eventi: or did i get that backwards
[20:06] marcello3d: does sweet javascript refactoring
[20:06] eventi: the point is i dont care - leave the java to the $2/hr code farms overseas
[20:06] gkatsev: intellij is the best
[20:06] eventi: and keep me (as a sysadmin) as far away from trying to get it to run as possible
[20:06] gkatsev: marcello3d: have you used webstorm at all?
[20:07] marcello3d: naw
[20:07] marcello3d: it's the same thing, isn't it?

[20:11] davemo has joined the channel
[20:12] marcello3d: the runtime speed doesn't bother
[20:12] marcello3d: but the compile/develop loop is so slow
[20:12] marcello3d: and despite being the best out there, the scala plugin for intellij is still shitty
[20:12] marcello3d: and the language is so thick...
[20:12] gkatsev: I've done it from the CLI a bunch
[20:13] marcello3d: need me some autocomplete and live syntax checking :)
[20:13] gkatsev: vim :)
[20:13] marcello3d: that's what makes java great to dev in
[20:13] marcello3d: vim has scala syntax checking?
[20:13] marcello3d: (not coloring)
[20:14] gkatsev: highlighting, which is good enough for me
[20:14] marcello3d: :)
[20:14] gkatsev: though, I did do most of my scala dev in intellij, vim was mostly for fixing up stuff during testing.

[20:15] mikegerwitz: compiler does the syntax checking. Unnecessary to have it in an IDE.
[20:17] gkatsev: yeah, that too
[20:17] marcello3d: mikegerwitz: I think the only people who would say that are the people who don't have it :)
[20:17] Zilee: Hey guys
[20:18] mikegerwitz: marcello3d: Been programming for 11 years, most of it usign vim, and I've never needed it :) Besides, it forces you to remember the syntax
[20:18] AAA_awright: mikegerwitz: Isn't that kind of the whole point of an IDE? An IDE is supposed to know the syntax you're typing, whereas a plain text editor doesn't
[20:18] AAA_awright: The very name of IDE implies it includes the compiler, syntax parser, etc
[20:19] marcello3d: AAA_awright: not so sure, I feel like that's a pretty modern concept
[20:19] gkatsev: marcello3d: it's nice to have when you are new to the language. But afterwards, it's uneeded. In fact, it can make people stupider programmers because they rely on the IDE too much.
[20:19] marcello3d: mikegerwitz: my point is satisfied by your statement :)
[20:19] marcello3d: gkatsev: I say it's quite the opposite
[20:19] marcello3d: it's terrible if you're new to the language, great if you're not

[20:20] jakehow has joined the channel
[20:20] marcello3d: intellij goes several steps further in java land, and it'll even automatically suggest variables and methods based on type
[20:20] marcello3d: like if I write String foo = bar.<command space>
[20:20] marcello3d: it'll bring methods on bar that return String up to the top of the list
[20:21] marcello3d: and if there's a String getFoo() it'll suggest that one first (based on name)
[20:21] marcello3d: makes coding amazingly fast
[20:22] marcello3d: another good one: component.addActionListener(new <command space> -> component.addActionListener(new ActionListener() { @Override public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) { ... } });
[20:22] clevrmunke: can anyone give me a hand with https://github.com/hij1nx/weld? I'm stuck on the demo
[20:22] marcello3d: (with proper whitespace, of course)
[20:22] marcello3d: it's not just special cased for library methods, that'll work with any interface/abstract class in that situation
[20:23] marcello3d: it will also do things like grey out public methods/variables that are never used/called anywhere 
[20:23] marcello3d: and let you safely remove them
[20:23] mekazu has joined the channel
[20:23] marcello3d: these are things you just can't replicate without an IDE
[20:24] mikegerwitz: you can do those with vim plugins :)
[20:24] marcello3d: refactoring is the big one. I never worry about bad variable/method/property names. I just write my code and once I'm satisfied, rename them to what makes sense

[21:19] Qix: the other one?
[21:19] augustl: what's in db.js on line 68?
[21:19] Qix: but the code that calls cb is really simple
[21:19] Qix:     console.log(cb);
[21:19] Qix:     self.query(sql, function(info) {
[21:19] Qix:       console.log(cb);
[21:19] Qix:       cb(info);
[21:19] mjr_: need link to code
[21:19] augustl: cb is probably undefined :)
[21:19] Aria: ... What's 'cb' there?
[21:19] Qix: but it isn't undefined before the call
[21:19] Qix: callback
[21:19] augustl: Qix: it must be
[21:19] Qix: it isn't
[21:19] augustl: it is

[21:20] augustl: Qix: something sets it to undefined :)
[21:20] augustl: Qix: look at all assingments of cb in it's scope
[21:20] Qix: its initially a parameter to a db.update function
[21:20] Qix: with no other assignments

[21:20] augustl: can't be moe specific without code
[21:21] malkomalko has joined the channel
[21:21] mjr_: Something set s it to undefined before the db query finishes.  Need full code.
[21:21] Qix: 1sec
[21:21] augustl: but it's not useful to say it's not undefined
[21:21] augustl: because it is
[21:21] augustl: debugging 101
[21:21] Qix: http://pastebin.com/EVrHfzZr
[21:21] Qix: no
[21:21] Qix: my problem is that its not undefined before the self.query call
[21:21] Qix: and that it gets undefined during that
[21:21] Qix: but i have no idea how
[21:22] mjr_: Surely there is more to this program
[21:22] marcello3d: what's err_cb?
[21:22] Qix: the cb is a parameter to the self.update function, how does it suddenly disappear with no other assignments?
[21:22] travyo has joined the channel
[21:22] eventi: hey - anyone use either nave or n or nvm? Have a preference
[21:22] Qix: marcello3d: old parameter, sorry - can drop that bit
[21:23] Qix: mjr_: i'm not sure if posting the whole program will help
[21:23] Qix: afaik its not possible for cb to be defined at the first console.log, and undefined at the second
[21:23] mjr_: Qix: whoever called self.update could change cb
[21:23] marcello3d: the only way to make cb go away in that case is to mess with the arguments object
[21:23] Qix: josh@dave:~/www/athena-master/server$ grep -r arguments .
[21:23] Qix: josh@dave:~/www/athena-master/server$ 
[21:24] marcello3d: so my guess is either the wrong code is being loaded
[21:24] marcello3d: or the error is actually elsewhere
[21:24] Qix: what does wrong code being loaded mean?

[22:21] noamsml: Ond: 1.0.7, so no
[22:21] noamsml: I don't think
[22:22] noamsml: Hm, is express 1.0 incompatible with node 0.4.0?
[22:22] drudge: yeah you gotta use 2.0beta
[22:23] noamsml: Oh, OK

[22:28] Aikar: mkrecny: http.request()

[22:29] Aikar: mkrecny: http.request({method:'HEAD', host:'', port: 80, path: '/'}, function(err, res) {});
[22:29] noamsml: Er, not default arguments
[22:29] dylang has joined the channel

[22:30] Ond: npm view express
[22:30] noamsml: Ond: Not v2.0beta
[22:31] marcello3d: the main problem is dealing with callbacks being the last argument
[22:31] marcello3d: with optional parameters in the middle
[22:31] Ond: The beta version is listed when you go "npm view express"
[22:31] aho has joined the channel
[22:31] Ond: It's the last version
[22:31] Ond: It's the version that would install by default 
[22:31] Ond: And I would advise against doing so

[23:33] mikegerwitz: AAA_awright: echo "console.log( 'Foo' );" > test.js && node test.js     -- does that work? Or does the output need to be sufficiently large?
[23:33] mikegerwitz: (to produce the bug)

[23:34] mikegerwitz: AAA_awright: perhaps that's why I haven't seen it..

[23:36] sivy has joined the channel
[23:36] liar has joined the channel
[23:37] mikegerwitz: AAA_awright: hm...with process.stdout.write and console.log, both finish outputting all 50,000 bytes I tried before exiting..
[23:37] mikegerwitz: AAA_awright: Including to a file
[23:37] mikegerwitz: I'm on 0.4.0 atm
[23:37] mikegerwitz: AAA_awright: GNU/Linux, but on a Debian machine atm, not Gentoo. Though I can't imagine that matters.
[23:37] AAA_awright: What version did I just check out actually I think it wasv 0.4.0... I'm checking
[23:38] AAA_awright: mikegerwitz: I don't think I actually used this program since maybe v0.4.5-pre or something like that
[23:38] AAA_awright: So it's likely after that, but I'm just making sure it's not some OS bug
[23:39] AAA_awright: I'm very sure it was after 0.4.0
[23:39] robotarmy has joined the channel
[23:40] mikegerwitz: AAA_awright: console.log() should also be syncrhonous..
[23:40] AAA_awright: As I understand console.log is not, it's just a wrapper for process.stdout.write(line+"\n")
[23:40] AAA_awright: console.error() is
[23:41] AAA_awright: And console.error does output all the text, it takes about 2 seconds on gnome terminal
[23:41] mikegerwitz: AAA_awright: Maybe I was thinking of error, hm
[23:42] mikegerwitz: AAA_awright: That was my next question..where the output was going
[23:42] AAA_awright: mikegerwitz: And redirecting to a file, nothing gets output. Appending appends nothing, writing to a new file creates an empty file
[23:43] mikegerwitz: AAA_awright: If I put enough vertical splits in gnu screen, the output is slow as shit. Let me try that and see
[23:43] xandrews has joined the channel
[23:43] mikegerwitz: AAA_awright: ..yeah took about 5 seconds to output it all and it did output everything
[23:43] mikegerwitz: Odd..
[23:43] mikegerwitz: (console.log)
[23:44] AAA_awright: mikegerwitz: Try process.stdout.write that's what I'm using
[23:44] AAA_awright: Console.log should be using that anyways
[23:44] AAA_awright: mikegerwitz: Also again, I'm pretty sure 0.4.0 didn't have the problem
[23:44] mikegerwitz: Oh, excuse me. that was using stdout.write
[23:44] AAA_awright: Still waiting to test that
[23:44] mikegerwitz: AAA_awright: I'll build master

[23:51] mikegerwitz: AAA_awright: I'm trying to think of anything else besides node that you could test that output with..but most things I know are blocking
[23:52] marcello3d: woah, express 2.0 is very different
[23:52] ryah: piscisaureus: hi
[23:52] marcello3d: apparently 'static' is a reserved keyword they're using? D:

[23:54] AAA_awright: Ubuntu seems to be doing it too
[23:54] AAA_awright: No compile needed
[23:54] mikegerwitz: AAA_awright: I wonder why I can't reproduce
[23:54] piscisaureus: ryah: pm
[23:54] mikegerwitz: AAA_awright: Honestly, your symptoms make more sense.
[23:55] mikegerwitz: AAA_awright: Unless all of it's being buffered (all 50k bytes) and still output after node exits
[23:55] AAA_awright: Ubuntu is outputting to files it looks like, but terminating early for console?
[23:55] AAA_awright: What is going on here
[23:55] whaka: i have node 0.5.0-pre and express 2.0.0beeta
[23:56] whaka: i think all i need is installed
[23:56] mikegerwitz: AAA_awright: Just to make sure it's a buffering issue / something like that, what happens if you add setTimeout( function() {}, 2000 ); at the end of your code, just to give node a reason to keep running for  a couple seconds
[23:56] AAA_awright: My other Gentoo is outputting to files...
[23:56] mikegerwitz: AAA_awright: Does it all output?
[23:56] AAA_awright: Yeah

[23:56] warz has joined the channel
[23:56] mikegerwitz: oops. completely misplaced my hands.
[23:56] whaka: have used debugger and can see that it bombs when server.js is trying stuff like express.bodyDecoder()
[23:57] mikegerwitz: AAA_awright: I don't know how the OS determines how much text to buffer...so idk if memory plays a factor

[23:57] AAA_awright: mikegerwitz: https://github.com/Acubed/sparql-spin-js3 The file in question is lib/parse.js, and on this system "make" isn't outputting the return of that command to the file I want
[23:57] AAA_awright: mikegerwitz: What command is that
[23:57] mikegerwitz: AAA_awright: hmm?
[23:58] mikegerwitz: AAA_awright: Oh you're calling process.exit..
[23:58] mikegerwitz: lemme try that
[23:58] AAA_awright: mikegerwitz: I'm outputting about 450k of data
[23:58] mikegerwitz: oh
[23:58] AAA_awright: Ohhh
[23:58] AAA_awright: That could affect things perhaps
[23:58] AAA_awright: mikegerwitz: You're totally right I wouldn't expect Node.js to wait for all to output if I've called process.exit
[23:58] AAA_awright: I need to send the 0 status though
[23:58] AAA_awright: (Though I guess it does that by default)
[23:59] AAA_awright: mikegerwitz: What command checks/sets the output buffer size, I thought there was one that did that
