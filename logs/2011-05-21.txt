[00:00] broofa: jerrysv that's in the most recent version. https://github.com/bentomas/node-mime/blob/master/node.types
[00:00] shimondoodkin: http://vot.me:2222/
[00:00] jerrysv: broofa: nevermind then! awesome, thanks
[00:00] shimondoodkin: just mockups yet
[00:03] hdon: hi all :) i'm trying to solve a problem and i thought i'd use node :)
[00:03] hdon: i love node's design philosophy, but i haven't played around with it in a while, so i thought i'd pop in here and see if anyone can answer my simple questions
[00:04] shimondoodkin: how to list all packages available in npm, this is my test file and it is not really working https://github.com/shimondoodkin/appmanager/blob/master/test.js it just prints text
[00:04] hdon: q0: what kinds of built-in functions can i use to serialize javascript data to the console?
[00:04] SubStack: shimondoodkin: npm search
[00:04] wilmoore has joined the channel
[00:04] isaacs: shimondoodkin: ls is not for searching any more.   search is for searching
[00:05] isaacs: ls is for listing out in tree-form the packages installed in a place.
[00:05] hdon: q1: where is the pipe() method of socket? i have the latest from git://github.com/joyent/node.git and the docs tell me there is a pipe() method, but it seems to be undefined
[00:05] SubStack: shimondoodkin: https://github.com/substack/npmtop/blob/master/top.js#L9
[00:05] hdon: TypeError: Object #<a Stream> has no method 'pipe' :(
[00:06] hdon: hmm... maybe i am not running the right version!
[00:06] SubStack: isaacs: so as soon as I can get pg&e to switch my gas back on I'll have a js hack night of my own!
[00:06] isaacs: SubStack: awesome!
[00:06] hdon: question: does 0.4.7 still say 0.2.0 when you node --version ?
[00:06] SubStack: previous tennant racked up soooo many bills, it's taking lots of effort to get everything set up
[00:07] shimondoodkin: isaacs++
[00:07] v8bot:  shimondoodkin has given a beer to isaacs. isaacs now has 20 beers.
[00:07] shimondoodkin: SubStack++
[00:07] v8bot:  shimondoodkin has given a beer to SubStack. SubStack now has 29 beers.
[00:08] hdon: hmm, according to src/node_version.h i have version 0.5.0
[00:08] hdon: but node --version gives me 0.2.0
[00:08] hdon: oh
[00:08] hdon: ACTION is stupid
[00:08] Swimming_bird has joined the channel
[00:08] hdon: hmm... my shell is not giving me output for `which node`
[00:09] hdon: but there is still a "node" command on my PATH
[00:10] hdon: oh, i tried to pipe() a file descriptor
[00:10] hdon: how do i pipe a file's contents?
[00:12] shimondoodkin: hdon: i do not understand your wquestion
[00:12] shimondoodkin: *question
[00:12] hdon: shimondoodkin, heh, i asked a lot of them, while answering them myself... terrible netiquette, i know
[00:12] hdon: my current question is: how do i open a file as a Stream, not a file descriptor?
[00:13] hdon: looking through lib/fs.js i think it's new fs.ReadStream(path)
[00:13] hdon: actually the new is implied
[00:13] hdon: however... ReadStream doesn't seem to be asynchronous
[00:14] rsms has joined the channel
[00:14] hdon: shimondoodkin, all i am trying to do is send a file's contents on a socket when a new client connects, then disconnect them 
[00:15] [[zz]] has joined the channel
[00:15] dgathright has joined the channel
[00:18] shimondoodkin: hdon: have you tried: fs.open(path, flags, [mode], [callback])
[00:18] shimondoodkin: hdon: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.7/api/fs.html#fs.open
[00:18] hdon: shimondoodkin, yes, that part works fine. however that gives me a file descriptor. i wanted a stream that i could pass to the pipe() method of a connection object
[00:19] timmywil has joined the channel
[00:19] shimondoodkin: hdon: maybe you should do stat method on it 
[00:20] shimondoodkin: hdon: have you tried fs.createReadStream(path, [options])
[00:20] hdon: shimondoodkin, like... as in the stat(2) syscall on UNIX?
[00:20] hdon: shimondoodkin, no i haven't. i have looked at it, though. i was discouraged against using that because it appears to not have asynchronous APIs
[00:21] shimondoodkin: no it is asynchroius
[00:21] shimondoodkin: it uses events
[00:21] shimondoodkin: you should defiine events quickly
[00:21] hdon: shimondoodkin, ah, thank you for informing me
[00:22] shimondoodkin: i used some kind of this well in the past
[00:22] jerrysv: tjholowaychuck: thanks!
[00:22] hdon: shimondoodkin, where does the continuation callback go with fs.createReadStream()?
[00:22] tsesame has joined the channel
[00:22] tjholowaychuk: jerrysv np
[00:23] greg has joined the channel
[00:23] shimondoodkin: var x=fs.createReadStream(); util.pipe(x,otherstrewam)
[00:23] hdon: i'll try that... still don't understand where a callback can go for asynchronously creating an fs.ReadStream
[00:23] shimondoodkin: or var x=fs.createReadStream(); x.on('data',function(){}) or the like
[00:24] hdon: shimondoodkin, is util a global var or is it a module i must require()?
[00:24] shimondoodkin: no it is a require('util')
[00:24] kersny:  hdon: is this what you want to do: https://gist.github.com/984063
[00:24] hdon: ACTION clicks
[00:25] shimondoodkin: var util = require("util");
[00:25] shimondoodkin: util.pump(readableStream, writableStream, [callback])
[00:25] hdon: kersny, yes precisely. however, i wonder why there is no asynchronous method to create an fs.ReadStream object.
[00:25] shimondoodkin: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.7/api/all.html#util.pump
[00:26] kersny: the asynchronicity is done through events
[00:26] kersny: like shimondoodkin said
[00:26] mcantelon has left the channel
[00:26] shimondoodkin: it creates  onject, the object has slim buffer, and input pause() method,
[00:26] hdon: kersny, is there any documentation or articles about these "events" i could use to learn about it?
[00:26] shimondoodkin: it based on event emiter
[00:27] hdon: it seems to me that the ReadStream() constructor cannot return until the file has been successfully opened, which may block
[00:27] kersny: http://howtonode.org/demystifying-events-in-node
[00:28] hdon: kersny, thanks :)
[00:28] hdon: hmm.. i have replicated the pastebin code exactly.. my connection seems to hang indefinitely
[00:28] shimondoodkin: you should close it?
[00:29] hdon: it seems that no data is being received
[00:29] shimondoodkin: you have to call a drain method to unpause it, am i correct?
[00:29] kersny: hmm... works for me with telnet
[00:29] hdon: my telnet client is just sitting pretty :(
[00:30] shimondoodkin: stream.resume()
[00:30] hdon: oh
[00:30] hdon: my stream object has fd: null
[00:31] shimondoodkin: add the on end before pipe
[00:31] shimondoodkin: it finishes quickly
[00:31] kersny: I updated the gist with the telnet output
[00:31] hdon: OH
[00:31] hdon: something about these events, i think
[00:31] hdon: made my ReadStream fail
[00:31] hdon: somehow
[00:31] kersny: make sure the file exists... :)
[00:32] hdon: kersny, yes i tried changing the filename to a ENOENT and it threw an error that stopped execution
[00:32] hdon: it seems that moving the instantiation to my client connection callback made it work
[00:32] cafesofie has joined the channel
[00:32] hdon: anyhow i will read this events article when ig et back
[00:32] hdon: gotta go to a party

[03:12] mscdex: meetar: yeah that depends if you have port 814 or whatever it is open
[03:12] mscdex: meetar: maybe it was 843
[03:12] mscdex: but it waits for that connection to timeout first before trying on the original host/port

[03:14] c4milo1: beriberikix: why do you need such thing? 
[03:14] beriberikix: See https://github.com/lloyd/JSONSelect
[03:14] meetar: mscdex: hmm thx for the tip, i will investigate that
[03:14] mscdex: ryah: there's an invalid job link on the nodejs front page and on the jobs site itself
[03:15] c4milo1: beriberikix: well imho that's a #fail 
[03:15] mscdex: ryah: the one for new fontier media
[03:15] c4milo1: beriberikix: why do you want over complicate something that by definition is simple
[03:15] ryah: hm
[03:16] jerrysv: i dunno, maybe some tech-savvy hr person?
[03:16] beriberikix: c4milo1: well, if you're doing heavy JSON work, it gets hairy
[03:16] c4milo1: beriberikix: do you think that ".author .drinkPref :first-child" is more simple that author.drinkPref[0] ? 
[03:17] c4milo1: beriberikix: it will be worst with that sintax 
[03:17] hexmare has joined the channel
[03:17] polotek: c4milo: well to be fair, selectors do traversal searches
[03:18] polotek: so .author .drinkPref would find .author.interests.drinkPref
[03:18] beriberikix: yes, like .language - http://jsonselect.org/#tryit
[03:18] hexmare: is there an example of using the crypto module to generate a sha256 hash out there? ( Haven't turned up anything on google ) 
[03:18] polotek: If you have a large object graph, I can see it being handy
[03:18] mscdex: hexmare: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.7/api/crypto.html#crypto.createHash

[03:23] jerrysv: polotek: you were an inspiration at nodeconf, btw, thanks
[03:23] polotek: c4milo1: agreed. many traversal methods for the DOM are written in C and probably utilize caching and ptr math underneath

[03:46] jerrysv: polotek: the gf and i made sure we were both at jsconf and nodeconf. awesome++
[03:48] polotek: excellent. that was my first jsconf as well
[03:48] jesusabdullah: Cool
[03:48] polotek: whole week was awesome
[03:48] jesusabdullah: Only tech conf I've been to is Scipy 2010
[03:48] jesusabdullah: that was kinda cool
[03:49] jesusabdullah: but in the end not really the sort of crowd I roll with
[03:49] polotek: jesusabdullah: what crowd is that?
[03:49] fakewaffle has joined the channel
[03:49] jesusabdullah: the scientific python crowd
[03:49] jerrysv: polotek: i'm from portland, so it was wondeful :)
[03:49] Wizek: For some challange take a look at here: http://prntscr.com/1wt4r. With the code beginning at line 15 I'm able to do what's on line 27. I'm looking for a way to make it work as seen on line 30.
[03:50] jesusabdullah: You know what also rocks? sweave.
[03:50] jesusabdullah: just sayin'.
[03:50] polotek: I had heard that python was big with in science research and academia
[03:50] jesusabdullah: I wish I knew about sweave in my undergrad
[03:50] polotek: always wondered why and how that came about
[03:50] jesusabdullah: Yeah, there are a few really nice libraries for matlab-ish stuff in python
[03:50] jesusabdullah: numpy and scipy
[03:50] jesusabdullah: so the ecosystem is nice
[03:51] jesusabdullah: It's procedural enough that people with prior experience with C or fortran are comfortable with it, but it has enough niceties that it feels a lot better
[03:51] jesusabdullah: between the low barrier to entry and the nice libs it's got a healthy scientific following
[03:52] jesusabdullah: Keep in mind, the alternatives for dynamic(-ish) languages are mostly proprietary piles of crap like MATLAB
[03:52] jesusabdullah: except in bioinformatics. Those guys used a lot of perl early on
[03:52] polotek: I do not miss matlab
[03:52] jesusabdullah: now people look at perl and think it's old and awkward
[03:53] polotek: Wizek: I'm not sure what you're getting at
[03:53] jesusabdullah: (whether that's true or not... :P)
[03:53] jerrysv: jesusabdullah: it is - have you seen the latest changes
[03:53] polotek: you want a function on the Object constructor called "_proto"
[03:53] polotek: Why not just Object._proto = function() { ... }
[03:53] jerrysv: jesusabdullah: the perl community is dying
[03:53] postwait has joined the channel
[03:53] polotek: jesusabdullah: I just never understood perl
[03:54] polotek: too many indirections and shortcuts
[03:54] polotek: it's one of the reasons I like js
[03:54] jesusabdullah: I never got around to learning it myself, but I've seen some of the stuff people have done and am impressed
[03:54] Wizek: polotek, Because that would make that numerable, and mess up for (x in y) loops
[03:54] jerrysv: polotek: perl can be good. if you are disciplined
[03:54] jesusabdullah: I think that, at the time, it was amazing
[03:54] SubStack: perl is super handy
[03:54] polotek: jerrysv: I guess that says something about me
[03:54] polotek: ;)
[03:54] dgathright has joined the channel
[03:54] SubStack: I certainly prefer perl to python
[03:54] jesusabdullah: and that other languages have just "caught up"
[03:54] jesusabdullah: Truth be told, if I knew perl I would probably prefer it as well
[03:55] jTNT: perl: great to write, horrendous to read ...
[03:55] jerrysv: polotek: no comment :) wish you would have joined us at bailey's
[03:55] jesusabdullah: From the perl I've read, it's usually not too bad save for a few gotchas
[03:55] jesusabdullah: but it really depends on who's writing it
[03:55] Wizek: jTNT, Why is it bad to read?
[03:55] jesusabdullah: timtowtdi can really end up biting your ass sometimes
[03:55] jerrysv: jTNT: we used to play perl golf, but write in intelligible perl
[03:55] SubStack: I was there!
[03:55] jesusabdullah: Wizek: Code golf? ;)
[03:56] jesusabdullah: hehe
[03:56] SubStack: had a tasty stout
[03:56] gkatsev has joined the channel
[03:56] Wizek: jesusabdullah, What do you mean?
[03:57] jesusabdullah: I mean, that you can write readable perl or you can write really obfuscated perl. Because perl tries to give you a lot of leeway, it's entirely possible to write a frontways dongle goblin in perl
[03:57] jesusabdullah: I mean, you can write obfuscated *anything*
[03:57] polotek: jesusabdullah: but it's really easy in perl
[03:57] jesusabdullah: but perl actively grants you the liberty to do so
[03:57] jesusabdullah: Exactly
[03:58] polotek: and the language gives you all these constructs that make it really tempting to do so
[03:58] jesusabdullah: Yeah, depending on how well you know it
[03:58] stevenou has joined the channel
[03:58] jerrysv: reality is the only word in the english language that should always be used in quotes, and perl is the only language that cannot parse itself
[03:58] jesusabdullah: I will say though, I've written some outrageous python in my time
[03:58] polotek: I haven't written much perl, but that was my experience with reading other people's code
[03:58] polotek: I had to learn way to much about perl to understand what they were trying to do
[03:59] polotek: I feel like code should be pretty readable even if you're not super familiar with the language
[03:59] jesusabdullah: Think nested array manipulations of nested list comprehensions
[03:59] jerrysv: polotek: my goal in life is to only hire people that can write readable code in any language
[03:59] jesusabdullah: Even more crazy, generating a numpy array using nested list comprehensions, doing something with it, typecasting back to a list and then zipping against an iterator
[03:59] jesusabdullah: or something nuts like that
[03:59] jesusabdullah: That's how you write unreadable python.
[04:00] polotek: jesusabdullah: yeah, array comprehensions and generators allow for some funky python
[04:00] polotek: not to mention operator overloading
[04:00] polotek: which ruins the readability of every language that has it
[04:00] jerrysv: C++ what?
[04:01] jesusabdullah: For example, yesterday I ended up writing something like, lambda o: dict(zip(dir(o), [getattr(o,m) for m in dir(o) if m not in dir(object())]))
[04:01] jesusabdullah: NOT READABLE
[04:01] jesusabdullah: but easy enough to write

[04:22] kgf has joined the channel
[04:22] jerrysv: c4milo1: wow. compared to a $8 arduino ...
[04:22] c4milo1: jerrysv: oh well, the BUG is more than a simple arduino 
[04:22] jesusabdullah: I'm trying to figure out what it is <_> I mean, I can tell it's computing
[04:23] jesusabdullah: Reminds me a little of beagleboards
[04:23] jesusabdullah: It is embedded, right?
[04:23] jesusabdullah: I mean, that's what it's for?
[04:23] jerrysv: c4milo1: i recognize that, but given some of the embedded stuff i've done over the years that's very expensive
[04:23] mscdex: pandaboards ftw!

[04:24] jesusabdullah: oh wait just found its
[04:24] jesusabdullah: the intro
[04:24] c4milo1: jerrysv: yeah, it is expensive

[04:26] c4milo1: jesusabdullah: ahah yes, we are improving our website though 
[04:26] jerrysv: c4milo1: one of my jobs was one of the primary purchasers of http://www.elotouch.com/Solutions/Retail/kiosks.asp
[04:26] jerrysv: c4milo1: which, with linux booting was under $800
[04:26] jesusabdullah: c4milo1: This looks like it's be pretty radtastic if you're working with the niche it's trying to fill
[04:27] jerrysv: jesusabdullah: not really, considering the price :/ x86 system ends up to be much cheaper
[04:27] jesusabdullah: jerrysv: I haven't gotten to price yet
[04:27] jesusabdullah: I'll comment on that in just a moment!
[04:28] JoshC has joined the channel
[04:28] jesusabdullah: I disagree jerrysv 
[04:28] c4milo1: alright, g2g 
[04:28] jesusabdullah: Yes, it's expensive, but it's also small and has a bunch of features that you're not gonna get with an x86
[04:28] jesusabdullah: low power
[04:28] jesusabdullah: designed to run completely wirelessly
[04:28] jesusabdullah: It *really* depends on what you want and need
[04:28] lakin has joined the channel
[04:28] jerrysv: jesusabdullah: so does arduino at even less
[04:29] jesusabdullah: but the arduino is at a different level here
[04:29] jesusabdullah: If anything, you should compare this to beagleboard + operating system + a bunch of plug-and-play shields
[04:29] jesusabdullah: This thing's mid-grade
[04:29] jesusabdullah: I think if they could cut the price, say, in half, it would be a lot more compelling
[04:30] bingomanatee has joined the channel
[04:30] jesusabdullah: but it's not filling the same niche as an arduino or MSP430 or any of that, and it's not the same as an x86 either
[04:31] jesusabdullah: I mean, price is still important, since at $800 I would probably start asking myself if I could do the same project with an old netbook or an arduino
[04:31] jesusabdullah: or a beagleboard
[04:31] jerrysv: jesusabdullah: sorry, just noting that i though that this particular solution was very expensive given that its toolset, platform, and volume is much higher than most things i've worked with, but in reality it's pretty off topic for the channel
[04:31] jesusabdullah: but I think it's sufficiently differentiated from other solutions that they might be able to swing it
[04:31] jesusabdullah: Meh, off topic
[04:31] jesusabdullah: I love OT <3
[04:32] jerrysv: jesusabdullah: 3 letters: a r m :)
[04:32] jesusabdullah: Isn't this an arm?
[04:32] jesusabdullah: or, arm-based?
[04:32] jerrysv: but wow expensive
[04:32] jesusabdullah: I'm 90% sure the beagleboard is
[04:32] killfill has joined the channel
[04:32] jesusabdullah: I wanna say the beagleboard is <$200
[04:33] jerrysv: as opposed to $900 getting started
[04:34] jesusabdullah: Right
[04:34] jesusabdullah: I agree that it's a comparative arm-and-leg

[06:20] bickie: cos at the moment, I have to have all my functions that reference with in a giant intended function scope (ugly)
[06:20] bickie: or pass it in to EVERY function
[06:20] bickie: (also ugly)
[06:20] gkatsev: it should've worked. No clue why
[06:20] gkatsev: anyway, I need sleep
[06:20] gkatsev: night
[06:20] tmpvar: bickie, yeah, both of those are not optimal
[06:21] bickie: is there a neat/handy way that's of handled?
[06:21] AvianFlu has joined the channel
[06:22] tmpvar: bickie, well beyond the "this is messy" argument.. you also need to know its available before you use it
[06:22] coreb has joined the channel
[06:22] tmpvar: and if connection is async.. that can be tricky
[06:22] tmpvar: i'd say push as much as you can into a lib
[06:22] bickie: hmm
[06:22] tmpvar: so you'd do something like
[06:23] bickie: I mean I don't mind something like the opening of the connection to effectively be syncronous
[06:23] bickie: (ie: once at startup)
[06:23] tmpvar: db.query("SELECT * FROM yo_mama", function(err, results) {})
[06:23] bickie: but yeah
[06:23] tmpvar: in db.query, it makes sure there is a connection and runs the query after one is made
[06:23] tmpvar: which requires some setup
[06:23] tmpvar: like, where is it connecting to
[06:24] DTrejo has joined the channel
[06:24] tmpvar: this problem has too many answers, unfortunately
[06:25] bickie: heh
[06:25] bickie: yeah
[06:25] bickie: I know exactly how I'd do it in a non sync way
[06:25] bickie: (ie: a simple function call with a singleton.. in fact.. maybe that's still the way to go)
[06:25] bickie: hrmph
[06:26] tmpvar: here's how'd i'd approach it round 1
[06:27] tmpvar: https://gist.github.com/984306
[06:27] tmpvar: where db is a reference to the connection that you want
[06:27] tmpvar: (so you can have multiple db's and all that jazz)
[06:28] bickie: yer
[06:28] bickie: ta for that, will have a play
[06:28] tmpvar: yeah, hide away some of the crazyness
[06:29] tmpvar: is my word of advice

[06:50] bickie: tmpvar: kk, think I have it working nicely
[06:50] bickie: basically declare some functionally global vars at the top of my module
[06:51] bickie: then have nice async methods that effectively act like a singleton
[06:51] bickie: ie: return existing DB conn if present, or create a new one if not

[07:02] deviantlinux: For an ajax chat application, using the idea behind Ryan's chat example on node.JS, how could I tell node.js that I'm userid 1, and I want to be notified when there's new data for userid 1? If the server is listening to everybody, how could it know to tell my client that there's new data for me?
[07:02] deviantlinux: sorry, not a chat app, I want a notification app.
[07:05] mscdex: deviantlinux: are you using something like socket.io or ?
[07:05] mikey_p: deviantlinux: if you're using socket.io you'd use channels
[07:06] mikey_p: basically keep a map of clients to user ids
[07:08] mscdex: if you're using socket.io, there's already a hash of all the connected clients, each has a unique id assigned
[07:08] mscdex: not sure if/how you get at that clients object off the top of my head though

[07:22] deviantlinux: I'd need to announce myself though, right? Say I'm userid 1, and let me know when there's something new.

[11:33] drudge:   akashiraffee use !=
[11:34] akashiraffee: Ah.  Will try.  Bet I am regretting sending that frustrated post to the mailing list if this works, LOL.
[11:35] stagas: akashiraffee: in ejs it's <%- partial() %> instead of <%=
[11:35] drudge: oh right ejs, not jade
[11:36] [algo] has joined the channel
[11:36] [algo]: what is the most used template in Express?
[11:36] [algo]: Jade?
[11:36] akashiraffee: <%- -> That just causes nothing to appear.
[11:36] drudge: i would say jade yeah
[11:36] [algo]: any EJS users ?
[11:36] akashiraffee: No sorry, typo
[11:37] [algo]: I started with EJS, but it doesn't make me glad :(
[11:37] drudge: jade is great, you really should try it
[11:37] akashiraffee: Whew, thanks.
[11:37] [algo]: but I can use EJS on client side
[11:37] akashiraffee: I guess I am using EJS, heh-heh.
[11:37] [algo]: so single framework on both sides
[11:37] drudge: [algo]: you can use jade in the browser too
[11:38] drudge: https://github.com/visionmedia/jade
[11:38] drudge: look at the readme for "Browser support"
[11:38] [algo]: the syntax is really strange for Jade
[11:38] [algo]: #products!= partial()
[11:39] [algo]: I guess that's variables, but looks really odd =)
[11:39] drudge: it's not strange, it's very useful shorthand
[11:39] drudge:  its the same as writing <div id="products"><%- partial() %></div>
[11:40] [algo]: :/
[11:40] [algo]: so really jade is much more used ?

[11:42] drudge: because it's what you are used to
[11:42] nexxy: no it's just
[11:42] [algo]: for me EJS has problems, because it forces me to define a variable
[11:42] [algo]: <% body %>
[11:42] [algo]: and if body is undefined - error
[11:42] febits has joined the channel
[11:42] [algo]: is there a way to make variable optional in EJS ?
[11:42] akashiraffee: yeah, that is irritating.
[11:43] nexxy: I haven't run into that issue
[11:43] [algo]: <% body? %>
[11:43] [algo]: <% body || '' %>
[11:43] [algo]: maybe this could do?
[11:43] nexxy: I would imagine
[11:43] [algo]: <%= body || '' %>
[11:44] nexxy: it probably is more like what I'm used to, but there's something that really bugs me about whitespace sensitivity
[11:44] akashiraffee: Well, you can use "undefined" as the value, but you still have to var: undefined in the render.
[11:44] [algo]: akashiraffee: can I have <%= body || '' %> ?
[11:44] [algo]: I don't want to provide a var
[11:44] nexxy: try it!
[11:44] stagas: [algo]: it's the same with jade. you can predefine all variables globally as undefined in app.locals({ foo: undefined }) if you don't want the error
[11:44] nexxy: [algo], you can pass defaults with the call to render
[11:45] akashiraffee: I dunno.  I kind of see it like a param list; if you want a NULL arg, you still have to use (NULL)
[11:45] stagas: so you can do foo || 'bar' without an error
[11:45] nexxy: stagas, I did not know that. thank you ;3
[11:45] [algo]: so it's same with jade..
[11:45] [algo]: ok
[11:45] jxck has joined the channel
[11:45] [algo]: I'd setup a vote
[11:45] [algo]: Jade vs EJS
[11:45] akashiraffee: But you're right, there should be an easy way.  Will try bar-bar
[11:45] nexxy: [algo], it's really a personal preference thing
[11:45] nexxy: just go with what you prefer
[11:45] nexxy: I was just weighing in
[11:46] akashiraffee: Nope, ejs does not appear to like ||
[11:46] nexxy: both are written by the same guy, so it's not like you're going to offend anyone
[11:46] nexxy: akashiraffee, how about uhm
[11:47] nexxy: ( body ? body : '' )
[11:48] stagas: what these engines are doing is with(locals) { ... } so passing an undeclared variable will throw
[11:48] nexxy: so pass 0 length strings!
[11:49] jonasen has joined the channel
[11:50] stagas: nexxy: no just declare them undefined, so if a render uses them they will be replaced, if not they will be === undefined
[11:50] nexxy: ohh
[11:50] akashiraffee: nexxy: Nah.  You can use <% if (var) {%><%=var%> too, but it still wants var to be set explicitly as "undefined"
[11:50] nexxy: akashiraffee, but omg is that ugly
[11:50] stagas: akashiraffee: that sucks :)
[11:50] akashiraffee: Which is a js thing I think, that "undefined' as a value is not the same thing as undefined.
[11:51] nexxy: mrr?
[11:51] stagas: conditionals in ejs are so ugly
[11:51] nexxy: well
[11:51] nexxy: you shouldn't be using conditionals anyway 
[11:51] nexxy: ;3
[11:51] akashiraffee: Well, you can spare the ugly by just explicitly defining var, as undefined.

[12:13] matjas_ has joined the channel
[12:14] akashiraffee: raynos:  Also with GC languages I tend to take it for granted.  The closure thing is maybe not such a big deal, it would seem it's only if you return the function/coderef, which is not obvious, but almost so.
[12:14] lumino has joined the channel
[12:14] raynos: akashiraffee: If you start nesting your callbacks 5 deep and your logic becomes complicated I have doubt you'll start leaking ;)
[12:15] ewdafa has joined the channel
[12:15] akashiraffee: I would still have thought that the inner function has the last reference to x, so when it's complete x is complete, I guess not.  Will watch for that.
[12:15] raynos: It's just generally an issue with enclosing scope in closures and the GC can't know when you no longer need something
[12:15] raynos: One solution is padentically over using "foo = null;" everywhere ;)
[12:15] raynos: That's my hammer !

[12:19] akashiraffee: The only coderefs I return are from class definitions, which I can't see as falling prey to that because 'this' is 'this', and that does get cleaned up.

[12:35] akashiraffee: Well, that particular issue about coderefs and closure is clear in my mind now anyway, it would seem to be the popular one because of the DOM.  Which as you say is not such a concern in node, but I guess the principle applies.
[12:35] mikegerwitz: raynos: The problem here is that "memory leak" may mean something for you conceptually, but you cannot detect it. To v8, it's just a reference that may be used in the future. so it can't GC it.

[12:37] Marak: :-D
[12:38] Marak: 0.0.1
[12:38] mikegerwitz: raynos: If you reference a variable within a closure, then the only way that variable will be GC'd is if the closure goes out of scope. Meaning anything storing it (such as EventListener objects) must either go out of scope or free it.
[12:38] Marak: !tweet @mikespokefire Once you go #nodejs, you never go back.
[12:38] kohai: @NodeKohai: @mikespokefire Once you go #nodejs, you never go back.
[12:38] akashiraffee: I think it is only if the closure involves an assignment.
[12:39] raynos: mikegerwitz: Does that mean "never using .removeListener" will create memory leaks?
[12:39] mikegerwitz: raynos: Nope. You can either use once(), so it's automatically freed, or it'll be freed once the EventEmitter goes out of scope
[12:39] raynos: Ok.
[12:40] raynos: It's still something I need to think really hard about
[12:40] akashiraffee: Eg, in node if you read Post data via a callback, you would be using closure if you had an on('data') that assigned to an outer variable, but you are not assigning that function, so it is gone, and it's reference is gone.
[12:40] [algo]: anyone using Socket.IO + Express ?
[12:40] mikegerwitz: raynos: Which is why it's important not to pass refernces around to 500,000 different objects. Thus my mention to structure your code well and don't tightly couple things.
[12:40] [algo]: how do you attach express actions to socket.io ?
[12:40] raynos: Oh that is important :)
[12:40] raynos: [algo]: define action
[12:41] [algo]: raynos: I mean express routing
[12:41] raynos: socket.io emulates a seperate TCP socket
[12:41] [algo]: yeah that's why.
[12:41] mikegerwitz: raynos: But it's a good sign you're putting a lot of consideration into it :) As long as you're keeping it in mind, they'll jump out at you in the code.
[12:41] raynos: socket.io runs a second server in parallel
[12:41] [algo]: yes raynos
[12:41] [algo]: but why should we use extra calls when we have socket.io channel
[12:42] raynos: mikegerwitz: the problem is I dont come from a non-GC background ;) I never cared about leaks or thinking about them. I dont trust myself to identify them
[12:42] [algo]: isn't it better for server/client communicate over socket.io rather than plain HTTP
[12:42] raynos: what your trying to do I dont think you can
[12:42] raynos: you can just only pass real functions to app.get() calls
[12:42] [algo]: in fact I did the following
[12:42] raynos: and then call those real functions with mocked out req & res objects through socket.io
[12:42] [algo]: socket.io accepts messages
[12:42] [algo]: and calls express routing 
[12:43] Schmallon has joined the channel
[12:43] mikegerwitz: raynos: As long as you understand conceptually how GC works, you'll be fine. Once an object goes out of scope and there is no possible way for *anything* else to reference it, it is scheduled to be GC'd.
[12:43] MikeMakesIt has joined the channel
[12:43] [algo]: so, express route is called on message.url
[12:43] akashiraffee: Exactly.  So it is not using closure per se.
[12:43] [algo]: seems quite convenient, but I wanted to discuss it with someone
[12:43] akashiraffee: It is assigning your inner function to something outside the scope of the outer function.
[12:43] raynos: mikegerwitz: I've got that one, it's just an issue of closures holding other things in scope when they shouldn't ;)
[12:44] saschagehlich has joined the channel
[12:44] raynos: akashiraffee: Yes things like that.
[12:46] mikegerwitz: raynos: One thing that may help is to ensure the objects you are using have a short life span. Consider an HTTP request, for example. A new object is created for each request, so any listeners can be freed once you're done with it. Whereas, if node had re-used a single object for every request, there'd likely be problems.
[12:46] mikegerwitz: raynos: Then, if you forget that a reference is there, you're still fine. The object goes out of scope, and the reference is freed

[12:53] iaincarsberg: Marak: yeah, I'm writing a game and one of my goals is to get all the code working in node and a browser, and one of the requirements of this is to have code thats either common to both platforms, or platform specific, so I want to do something like reutrn require('node/score') || require('browser/score');
[12:53] jdalton has left the channel
[12:53] kohai: Bye jdalton!
[12:53] iaincarsberg: Marak: require('node/score') || require('common/score') even
[12:54] raynos: iaincarsberg: A different way to deal with that is to only use require in node and to just use a global namespace in the browser
[12:55] raynos: so you have things like if (require) require("node/score") else use global.Score
[12:55] raynos: Just to point out require is blocking and should only be called on server set up ;)

[14:14] ewdafa has joined the channel
[14:14] eldar: but there's no such a module, at least not in npm
[14:14] akashiraffee: eldar:  yes, because "icon" is not a render module, like ".ejs"
[14:14] akashiraffee: The problem is, you should not be using a catchall regex or glob like * in your routes and then saying, render that.  
[14:15] akashiraffee: If you have a catchall, you should return a 404.

[14:18] Silly_Wabbit has joined the channel

[15:28] skm: this is the output: http://dpaste.com/545065/

[18:23] wafflesburger: what i mean is that its because of how stringify is implemented (my guess)

[18:38] Posdl: Cool
[18:38] hdon: stagas, probably checks if a filename/pathname exists
[18:39] hdon: stagas, the "Sync" means that it will block until the value is known, and will be returned
[18:39] hdon: stagas, as opposed to giving it a callback function to execute when the value becomes known

[20:07] Marak: hrmm?
[20:07] tholder: npm says it's installed still though
[20:08] tholder: weird, ok will give that a shot. Sorry total node noob!
[20:08] Marak: npm disagrees with you, Error: Cannot find module 'express'
[20:08] Marak: err
[20:08] Marak: require() rather
[20:08] Marak: npm too i bet though
[20:08] isaacs: tholder, Marak: global installs aren't for require()
[20:08] Marak: yeah exactly
[20:08] isaacs: install locally for require()
[20:08] Marak: we just had him delete his global install i believe
[20:08] tholder: that didn't work - so should I just npm install express ? in the app folder
[20:09] samsonjs: tholder: in order to use global modules I had to export NODE_PATH=/usr/local/lib/node_modules
[20:09] Marak: yeah
[20:09] isaacs: tholder: yes
[20:09] Marak: install it locally
[20:09] tholder: export NODE_PATH=/usr/local/lib/node_modules
[20:09] kohai: @danmactough: Building node.js on my VPS

[20:14] wafflesburger: in jade template, how do i use a markdown filter with js variable
[20:15] samsonjs: isaacs: so the recommended workflow is to never require globally installed modules? sometimes I just want to mess around in a repl, not create a directory and install local modules just to mess with something I already have installed. am I missing something?

[21:48] wafflesburger: was working
[21:48] wafflesburger: but its not processing

[22:06] wafflesburger: at what level would i do this
[22:07] shazmoh: Upgraded to npm 1.0.X from 0.X version. When I run npm install <package_name> it copies the package files to current directory, opposed to one central location. What am I missing? 
[22:07] isaacs: shazmoh: you're only missing that that's intended behavior :)
[22:07] shazmoh: Also I upgraded node to latest from very old version
[22:07] wafflesburger: -g flag wil do global
[22:08] isaacs: shazmoh: install locally to require() things
[22:08] isaacs: shazmoh: it's good.  `npm help global` for more info
[22:08] isaacs: shazmoh: or npm faq
[22:08] wafflesburger: lots of packages require a local install
[22:08] eksmith has joined the channel
[22:08] wafflesburger: such as express
[22:08] wafflesburger: mongoose
[22:08] shazmoh: isaacs: ok cool. thx
[22:08] isaacs: you can also use `npm link express` to install it globally, and symlink it into your local project so you can require() it
[22:08] shazmoh: got it
[22:09] wafflesburger: yeah if you're running on a ti-83 that might be something you would like to do
[22:09] isaacs: (and then doing `npm link express` would not have to install it again globally, if it's already there)
[22:09] isaacs: wafflesburger: hah

[22:45] ryah: bingomanatee: calling an async function
[22:45] wafflesburger: yes stagas
[22:45] ryah: :)
[22:45] bingomanatee: ok - and what makes a function asynchronous 
[22:46] ryah: bingomanatee: performs i/o
[22:46] bingomanatee: okay - so only functions in the core node libraries can be asychronous?
[22:46] bingomanatee: or are they required to extend the event class?
[22:47] ryah: bingomanatee: i mean - the real answer is that something gets registered with the event loop
[22:47] hever: Hej. I have to send a lot of HTTP requests parallel and process their result. Is node.js the right tool for that or can you recommend better tools? Can node.js process the results parallel?
[22:47] ryah: and that can be one of several types of "watchers"
[22:47] bingomanatee: okay thanks. 
[22:47] stagas: wafflesburger: that's strange then, if you do a div!= post.body does it output the text?

[22:55] kohai: I am Kohai, semi-useful communications-facilitating pseudointelligence!
[22:55] chjj: if the markdown text is hardcoded into the template, it doesnt have to process the markdown every time the template is rendered
[22:55] wafflesburger: right
[22:55] wafflesburger: but /why/ would you use markdown there if you're already using jade..
[22:55] wafflesburger: markdown is mainly used for content producers, irght?
[22:56] wafflesburger: *right?
[22:56] chjj: dont know, i dont really use jade

[22:57] AdmGre has joined the channel
[22:57] chjj: yes, thats what im saying

[22:58] chjj: im confused, it you dont see the point in using the markdown filter in the first place, why are you criticizing the way it works?

[23:00] mscdex: hever: sure
[23:00] mjr_: hever: yes
[23:00] stagas: chjj: he has a point, having the markdown filter without the ability to pass a body variable to it makes it pretty useless
[23:00] chjj: why? its a quick way to add in text level semantics to static text you would want in a template?
[23:00] hever: mscdex, I mean would node.js really the way to go or best practise?
[23:00] chjj: minus the last "?"
[23:00] wafflesburger: jade already does that...
[23:01] chjj: is it particularly concise though?
[23:01] wafflesburger: it's not particularly important, if you're hard coding text it will not change much
[23:01] hever: As far as I understand it, it does everything in one thread but if I get a lot of responses I've to process my task is to proccess them parallel....
[23:02] mscdex: hever: right, node can't do that just fine
[23:02] mscdex: er
[23:02] mscdex: can
[23:02] mscdex: haha
[23:02] stagas: chjj: no, you can't do :markdown= body
[23:02] chjj: wafflesburger: so yeah, technically isnt isnt terribly necessary, but like i was saying before, it was probably simple to implement
[23:02] hever: mscdex, so node can process the responses parallel?
[23:02] chjj: stagas: i never said you could
[23:03] mscdex: hever: yes, node uses an event loop
[23:03] SubStack: oh hey it's JSBBQ TIME
[23:03] mjr_: hever: you can use things like "cluster" to take advantage ofmultiple cores.

[23:25] olegstepanov: @tbranyen but still what do you mean?
[23:25] katspaugh: olegstepanov: "bind" creates a closure internally. function () { console.log(this.a); }.bind({ a: 1 })() would print 1.

[23:26] mscdex: :p
[23:26] tbranyen: if you're doing multiple nesting like olegstepanov is, you might as well just do var that = this; at the top layer and be done with it
[23:26] mscdex: var self = this; !
[23:27] tbranyen: or self, who gives a shit
[23:27] tbranyen: its a variable name
[23:28] gkatsev: var bob = this;
[23:28] katspaugh: I'm not sure if it will be as clean if the scope in which you define "that" variable contains other variables. The original example by dhasenan seems OK, though.

[23:39] isaacs: k
[23:40] isaacs: thanks
[23:40] mikey_p: i.e. node_modules/a/node_modules/foo (v0.1) and node_modules/b/node_mofules/foo (v0.2)

[23:40] mikey_p: module a would use v0.1 and b would use v0.2 ?

[23:41] isaacs: raynos: no need, just published 0.1.5 with the change
[23:41] wormphlegm has joined the channel
[23:42] isaacs: mikey_p: that is the reason exactly, yes.
[23:42] mikey_p: if A and B are used in the same app does that still work, or does require only resolve the dependency once?
[23:44] raynos: isaacs: Still can't run global commands. Am I supposed to add something to my PATH?
[23:44] Draggor has joined the channel
[23:44] isaacs: mikey_p: it'll work no matter what.
[23:44] isaacs: mikey_p: require() caches based on the resolved filename
[23:45] isaacs: raynos: please gist exactly what youer' doing that isn't working
[23:45] raynos: Or better phrased I don't get any warning about global installation with "npm link" :)

[23:45] isaacs: raynos: if you're using nave, globals should show up somewhere under ~/.nave/<node version>/bin
[23:45] isaacs: global bins, that is

[23:50] hever: I wrote this really simple nodejs program to issue HTTP request. If I run it I can get max. 24 KiB and my CPU is aroung 40%. How could I increase the load?

[23:53] raynos: It seems like npm link doesn't try to install things globally.
[23:53] isaacs: you don't need to do `list installed` any more. just `list`
[23:53] isaacs: if you wanna searh the registry, do `npm search`
[23:53] isaacs: raynos: so, the issue here is that those things are all child packages of the main one.
[23:54] isaacs: raynos: child packages don't get their bins linked into the PATH
[23:54] raynos: Ah ok.
[23:54] raynos: can I use package.json to install something globally? 
[23:54] isaacs: you can, of course, add /usr/local/lib/node_modules/Blaggie-System/node_modules/.bin to your PATH env
[23:54] isaacs: raynos: no.
[23:54] raynos: Fair enough
[23:54] isaacs: raynos: that is, "dependencies" are never installed globally.  they're installed inside the thing that depends on them.
[23:55] isaacs: even if the parent is global, they're effectively local

[23:55] isaacs: otherwise the dep-bundling-segregating logic would have a hole in it :)
[23:55] raynos: So if I want to set up a bunch of global depenencies on a machine I'm better of using a sh script
[23:56] wafflesburger: does any place host node free? :D
[23:56] raynos: wafflesburger: Yes :D It's called localhost
[23:56] raynos: You host node for "free" ;)
[23:57] wafflesburger: :P
[23:57] wafflesburger: what if i'm not confident in exposing my home computer raynos :D
[23:57] raynos: wafflesburger: how bad could it be
[23:58] wafflesburger: idk, how bad could it be?
[23:58] hever: mscdex, do you have any hint for me ?
[23:58] wafflesburger: i don't want people trying to stick dirty things into my ports raynos

[23:59] raynos: Only open the ports you want ;)
[23:59] wafflesburger: i am newb 2 linunx tho
