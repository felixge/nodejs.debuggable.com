[00:17] wereHamster: is it safe to delete keys from an object while iterating through it?
[00:17] jamescarr has joined the channel
[00:17] theycallmeswift: wereHamster: how are you iterating?
[00:17] wereHamster: in coffee-script, something like delete object[k] for k,v of object
[00:18] isaacs: wereHamster: can you say that in javascript?
[00:18] isaacs: wereHamster: your example isn't parsing

[00:22] idoru has joined the channel
[00:22] jamescarr: demonii, kind of
[00:22] Shaunzie: demonii: try npm search php session
[00:22] demonii: thanks, would it also work for socket sessions?
[00:23] nibblebot has joined the channel
[00:23] mikeal has joined the channel
[00:24] Shaunzie: demonii: that would be something for you to implement
[00:24] isaacs: wereHamster: why do you need to do this?
[00:24] isaacs: wereHamster: it'd be faster to do Object.keys(object).forEach(function (k) { delete object[k] })
[00:24] isaacs: wereHamster: or even better yet:  object = Object.create(Object.getPrototypeOf(object)) or even just object = {}
[00:25] wereHamster: isaacs: it's not actually just 'delete object[k]', but more code which does somtehing and then deletes the key
[00:25] isaacs: wereHamster: anyway, yes, you may delete a property while iterating
[00:26] demonii: Shaunzie, I serve my http data through apache, only my socket.io sessions are being handled by node.js
[00:26] isaacs: it's not like a dynamic array or something
[00:26] demonii: not sure if nodePhpSessions can handle only socket.io session data
[00:26] isaacs: wereHamster: this, for example, is highly unsafe:   x = getSomeArrayOfThings();  for (var i = 0, l = x.length; i < l; i ++) x.splice(i, 1)
[00:26] wereHamster: isaacs: why is Object.keys().forEach() faster than a for loop? Does v8 optimize the function calls out of the former?
[00:27] isaacs: wereHamster: function calls are cheaper than prototype lookups
[00:27] isaacs: wereHamster: the savings comes from Object.keys vs for/in
[00:27] wereHamster: isaacs: Object.keys() does not access the prototype?
[00:27] isaacs: (note: haven't benched in a while, ymmv, but this is the general rule of thumb that's served me well)
[00:27] isaacs: wereHamster: nope
[00:27] isaacs: it's only enumerable own properties
[00:27] wereHamster: isaacs: interesting. good to know

[00:41] demonii: but if that's the approach on things with node.js, i'd be happy to gtfo
[00:41] drostie: demonii: well, usually the documentation is relatively good. The problem is that Node.js just says that it's a frontend to OpenSSL but doesn't say what part it's a frontend to. I did an encryption and got a 25-byte response from something which should be in 16-byte blocks, so the question is, "wtf are the other 9 bytes doing here?"

[01:20] lwille: bnoordhuis, thanks for the advice - but this is not exactly what I was looking for. The node-event-emitter example exports the Emitter prototype from a native extension and then lets it inherit the prototype methods of events.EventEmitter. That means, the resulting object can only be instantiated on the javascript side - I would like to create the instance on the C++ side, because until now my extension didn't need an extra javascript lay

[02:16] TooTallNate: specifcally, how does the double event loop thing work?
[02:16] tim_smart: TooTallNate: Sure. I think the direction node-gir is taking is probably better.
[02:16] TooTallNate: oh ok
[02:16] tim_smart: Oh right
[02:17] TooTallNate: I may need to do something similar for NodObjC
[02:17] TooTallNate: https://github.com/TooTallNate/NodObjC/issues/2
[02:17] tim_smart: Event loop stuff I asked the author of libev about
[02:17] tim_smart: If would have changed now that libev is now libuv

[02:18] daiyechu has joined the channel

[02:33] blueadept: anyone here ever use http://www.ericmmartin.com/projects/simplemodal ?
[02:33] drostie: Wow. so apparently when Node's crypto functions are used, all user input is fed into MD5 to generate the key. The stream MD5(key) + MD5(MD5(key) + key) + MD5(MD5(MD5(key) + key) + key) + ... is broken up into the actual bytes needed for the key and the actual bytes needed for the IV.

[02:39] TooTallNate: well, probably >1 thread in a lot of cases
[02:39] Shaunzie: I'm really starting to like coffee scriptâ€¦ 
[02:39] TooTallNate: but in any case, that blog article looks like it has a nice hack for running the cfrunloop
[02:40] tjfontaine: looks like it's using the timer interface
[02:40] TooTallNate: which could be done in a indefinite nextTick calls
[02:40] tjfontaine: indeed
[02:41] tjfontaine: you'll probably want the timeout to potentially be configurable, incase people start seeing dropped or stalled events
[02:41] TooTallNate: true
[02:42] TooTallNate: pretty hacky, but at least it may be possible to get the two loops working together like that
[02:42] TooTallNate: at least until a libuv backend written in ObjC is written :p
[02:42] TooTallNate: ACTION dreams...
[02:42] tjfontaine: hah

[02:43] tjfontaine: in that case it would have been trivial

[02:44] Aria: ub_run is so trivial, and I bet it's not too hard to do on the windows side (though I've not looked)
[02:45] TooTallNate: Aria: interesting thought
[02:45] tjfontaine: TooTallNate: unless you're license averse there are some excellent clues here http://opensource.apple.com/source/CF/CF-476.14/CFRunLoop.c
[02:45] tjfontaine: TooTallNate: search for zero-timeout

[02:46] bnoordhuis: uv_run_once() already exists
[02:46] bnoordhuis: in libuv's master that is
[02:46] TooTallNate: bnoordhuis: not in node 0.6.x?
[02:47] bnoordhuis: TooTallNate: no
[02:47] TooTallNate: ok so I could potentially use that and be > 0.6.x
[02:48] TooTallNate: but so how would that work? just continually call that in CFRunLoop's equivalent of a nextTick?
[02:48] tjfontaine: uv_run_once would be CFRunLoop driving node, right?
[02:48] tjfontaine: setup a loop on the cf side, and inside it each time it loops you call uv_run_once
[02:49] al3xnull has joined the channel
[02:49] TooTallNate: that would be nice, cause then you could use whatever ObjC API you want to start the event loop
[02:49] TooTallNate: and not some NodObjC-specific API
[02:50] tjfontaine: TooTallNate: but it means diverging node itself
[02:50] TooTallNate: how so?
[02:50] TooTallNate: as long as the original node API's and modules work, that's what I'm looking for
[02:51] TooTallNate: cause currently, when a CFRunLoop is running, it's blocking node, and JS, and no async node APIs work

[02:52] ovaillancourt has joined the channel
[02:53] isaacs has joined the channel
[02:53] tjfontaine: possibily, I think it would render interesting results, generally I would say you wouldn't want node to start its first event loop, and that it shoudl be your cfrunloop that is responsible for handling the uv_run_once
[02:54] TooTallNate: well actually, as long as your NodObjC script starts the cfrunloop in the first tick, the node's event loop is not yet running
[02:54] tjfontaine: TooTallNate: I'll be interested to hear the results in any event
[02:54] idefine_ has joined the channel
[02:54] tjfontaine: TooTallNate: I don't know the node event loop well enough, but I would guess that a require() sure as hell starts the loop since it requires io
[02:55] TooTallNate: also, it would be nice to be able to dynamically get at the ev_run function, maybe using libffi
[02:55] TooTallNate: tjfontaine: not so, it's sync io, so not event loop needed
[02:55] TooTallNate: not til after the first tick doest the event loop begin

[09:24] abraxas: libuv is the library they made that deals with the I/O APIs for different operating systems (windows, posix)

[11:42] tytsim has joined the channel
[11:43] deoxxa: would it speed things up significantly to put the function defined on line 6 somewhere else, then refer to it by name?
[11:43] TheNumb: deoxxa: yay for spaghetti code!
[11:43] case_: deoxxa, i'll be extremly suprised if that changed anything

[11:59] RLa: "new items"?
[11:59] RLa: i guess you need to manually keep track which are new and which are not
[12:00] Hinton: Well grab the feed once on initialization, and regrab it after 10min or so to check if there are new items
[12:00] shinuza has joined the channel

[12:00] RLa: tho there might be some better way
[12:01] Hinton: pubdate of the last items and compare it to the new last item?

[16:12] qbit_: I think I might have an issue with the openbsd package.. but I am not 100% sure
[16:13] isaacs: qbit_: that error probably comes from outside of node itself.
[16:13] isaacs: qbit_: maybe you have to rebuild expat?

[16:16] Iszak: well then promote it
[16:16] isaacs: Iszak: but yes, we strive for ever greater stability.
[16:16] Iszak: I think it's wrong to release a beta in a node.js, even if it's a technicality.

[16:22] bradleymeck: iaincarsberg, express is a pretty good start, but flatiron or journey are other ones ive used and liked a lot

[16:43] maritz: jerrysv: it's a good idea to do this on things like login or reset password to mitigate brute force attacks and make sure that no one can make a good guess at what is happening. (for example in a login it might take noticably longer if the password is incorrect than if only the email is incorrect. a random delay makes this way harder)
[16:43] iaincarsberg: jerrysv: I'm writing a web interface for hook.io cloud. The cloud needs to be scalable and fault tolerant, so the idea is to use a restful api to store 'batches' in a redis list, where the hook cloud will process the data, then message the restful api with the result, which will then be transmitted to the enduser

[17:44] lietu: right .. well all I see is that the issue seems to be that for some reason it wants to create a symlink and fails when it can't do it, and you can't do symlinks on cifs
[17:44] ioparadigm: lietu, i ended up leaving my source, nodejs, npm, and modules on the other machine, which i use samba and a network map to access that filesystem
[17:44] lietu: it looks like this has something to do with "io.js" or "/___socket.io-client.npm/package/lib/socket.io-client.js"
[17:44] chrispaterson has joined the channel
[17:44] cognominal has joined the channel
[17:44] ioparadigm: lietu, and ssh to the machine
[17:44] lietu: could be it's trying to symlink one to the other
[17:45] torvalamo: can you paste the error?
[17:45] lietu: well, my source folder is automatically backed up from one place, and it would take somewhat considerable effort to arrange it otherwise, and I can only really mount it over cifs since I'm running winblows on the machine with the source folder .. I could work around this issue if I could just figure out what I need to do to access the modules installed with -g
[17:46] mattgifford has joined the channel
[17:46] lietu: I don't see how that'll help, but I can do it
[17:46] torvalamo: just to see which files may be involved
[17:46] amasad_ has joined the channel
[17:46] kickingvegas has joined the channel
[17:47] ioparadigm: lietu, well, instead of the nodejs server mounting your windows share, you can have windows mount the linux share and it will fix the problem, if thats possible, i couldnt find a solution
[17:47] lazyshot has joined the channel
[17:47] lietu: http://pastebin.com/4FdGXT70
[17:47] torvalamo: oh, btw.. you can still do "npm install socket.io -g" on the server and then just copy the contents of /usr/local/lib/node/node_modules/socket.io to your working_dir/node_modules/socket.io
[17:48] postwait has joined the channel
[17:48] lietu: can't I just configure my node to find the modules from where-ever npm install -g puts them?
[17:48] torvalamo: that was the default before
[17:48] TooTallNate has joined the channel
[17:48] lietu: and I highly doubt it goes to /usr/local since I'm not running this as root
[17:49] zanefactory has joined the channel
[17:49] torvalamo: if you run npm install -g you need root
[17:49] ioparadigm: lietu, if you go to / directory, and install the modules there, it will find them, it recurses backwards up to "/" looking for /node_modules
[17:49] torvalamo: i think it asks
[17:49] lietu: torvalamo: no, not the way I have it installed .. it installs stuff to ~/.npm
[17:49] lietu: ~/.npm/socket.io/0.8.7/
[17:49] torvalamo: with -g?
[17:49] lietu: oh, and /package after that
[17:49] lietu: ... yes
[17:50] lietu: I just installed this with nvm to a single user
[17:50] torvalamo: ok well copy it from there to your project's node_modules folder
[17:50] sridatta has joined the channel
[17:51] ryan_stevens has joined the channel
[17:51] Nassosdim has joined the channel
[17:51] lietu: so why can't I just configure node to require stuff properly from npm install -g location?
[17:52] torvalamo: well you can
[17:52] torvalamo: if you give it the full path
[17:52] slajax has joined the channel
[17:52] isaacs has joined the channel
[17:52] torvalamo: require('~/.npm/socket.io etc
[17:52] lietu: mjeah, they're saying that you shouldn't use the stuff installed with -g directly for whatever random reasons, and saying I should use link, which of course doesn't work
[17:53] lietu: well the full path isn't very portable
[17:53] torvalamo: exactly
[17:53] ioparadigm: lietu, you might want to carefully read http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html
[17:53] ioparadigm: also see "Loading from the global folders"
[17:54] martypdx has joined the channel
[17:54] lietu: mjeah, well it says the same thing, I am highly encouraged to place my dependencies locally in node_modules folders, though it doesn't really explain why I should do that
[17:54] torvalamo: http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html#loading_from_the_global_folders
[17:54] ioparadigm: lietu, in my experience, you will need to install the modules somewhere else than on the windows share with npm, and there are ways to let node where you installed them somewhere on the native linux FS

[17:54] franciscallo has joined the channel
[17:55] isaacs has joined the channel
[17:55] lietu: torvalamo: you do know that's essentially the same link as earlier, and yes, I did read that section
[17:55] dylang_ has joined the channel
[17:55] pizthewiz has joined the channel
[17:56] torvalamo: yes that's the same link and it seemed like you didn't
[17:56] lietu: as I said, "I am highly encouraged to place my dependencies locally in node_modules folders, though it doesn't really explain why I should do that" .. but yeah, fine, I can manually cp it from the install -g location, but it feels pretty stupid
[17:56] torvalamo: or you can change node_path on the machine itself
[17:56] lietu: yes, I can, but I'm highly recommended to not do that
[17:56] TheJH: lietu, place them in the local folder so that you can copy it to another machine and it works
[17:56] deedubs: so all these people recommending you should put them in node_modules and not do anything else.  What's the problem again?
[17:56] jjido has joined the channel
[17:57] TheJH: lietu, after all, you want software to work on othe machines, too
[17:57] tablackmore has joined the channel
[17:57] TheJH: lietu, also, you might want different versions of a module for different projects
[17:57] lietu: well, the problem originally was that "npm install socket.io" crashed when trying to create a symlink on a cifs filesystem, and "npm install -g socket.io" and "npm link socket.io" fails 'coz it was trying to do hardlinks from one fs to another .. 
[17:58] TheJH: hardlinks???
[17:58] lietu: I *can* do a cp -a ~/.npm/... to my local node_modules folder, but it feels pretty stupid to manually do that
[17:58] jjido has joined the channel
[17:58] josh-k has joined the channel
[17:58] lietu: well that's what someone said it's trying to do, the other option is that it's trying to do symlinks, which will also fails, since it's cifs
[17:58] ioparadigm: lietu, if you try to use npm inside a windows share it wont work, so you must use npm inside a folder that is native linux FS, then copy them over, or you can mount linux FS and access your source there instead of having linux mount windows share
[17:58] isaacs: lietu: do not do that.
[17:58] lietu: isaacs: do what?
[17:59] isaacs: lietu: ~/.npm is a cache folder
[17:59] tablackmore: I'm having a problem with npm when I do npm install anyModule in a directory all works but the path it places the modules in is all messed up i.e. ../../../../node_modules/express
[17:59] isaacs: lietu: it's not an installation
[17:59] lietu: oh
[17:59] TheJH: tablackmore, delete that folder
[17:59] isaacs: tablackmore, lietu: please run `npm help folders` and read through it
[17:59] isaacs: tablackmore: delete that node_modules folder, or create a package.json in your project first.
[17:59] hipsters_ has joined the channel
[17:59] isaacs: tablackmore: like git, npm walks up to the highest node_modules folder or package.json it finds, and uses that as the local root
[17:59] hackband has joined the channel
[18:00] robi42 has joined the channel
[18:00] tablackmore: @isaacs great thanks for the explanation gotcha
[18:00] dshaw_ has joined the channel
[18:00] isaacs: lietu: you can set the NODE_PATH environment variable, but that's not recommende.d
[18:00] lietu: ok, so it's at ~/.nvm/v0.6.7/lib/node_modules/ then
[18:00] isaacs: lietu: local package installs are better.
[18:00] isaacs: lietu: it's better to just install it in your app's node_modules folder.
[18:01] torvalamo: he cant do it automatically because of cifs
[18:01] lietu: yeah, I read that, I can do it, but that it's highly not recommended .. but again
[18:01] lietu: ... the issue is that I'd have to manually cp it 
[18:01] lietu: it's not really THAT big of an issue, just a big annoyance, for one, whatever it expects to be symlinked really isn't
[18:01] sridatta has joined the channel
[18:01] sarlalian has joined the channel
[18:02] te-brian has joined the channel
[18:02] lietu: ah, and well, cp -a fails because it's trying to create symlinks .. cp -aL seems to work though
[18:02] magnetik_ has joined the channel
[18:02] isaacs: lietu: you should not have to manually cp it.
[18:02] torvalamo: isaacs: http://pastebin.com/4FdGXT70 his error log
[18:03] isaacs: lietu: what is it you're tryign to do?  either npm can't do it, shouldn't do it, or you're just lacking the proper command, i'm guessing.
[18:03] mattgifford has joined the channel
[18:03] ioparadigm: lietu, i dont think anyone can help you, you cant make a symlink in windows share, try yourself
[18:03] torvalamo: he's trying to npm install in his app folder, but that app folder is on a cifs mount
[18:03] isaacs: ugh.  unknown error.
[18:03] isaacs: what's cifs?
[18:03] mc: samba
[18:03] mc: windows share
[18:03] torvalamo: like an internet mount thing
[18:03] isaacs: ohhhhâ€¦ ok
[18:03] isaacs: yeah, that will not work.
[18:04] lietu: ... ok, I've got a project folder, at ~/source/foo/ .. ~/source is a cifs mount, I'm trying to "npm install socket.io", which is trying to create two symlinks, which will fail, because it's cifs that doesn't support them .. also, "npm install -g socket.io" & "npm link socket.io" will fail for the same reason
[18:04] ericmuyser has joined the channel
[18:04] isaacs: lietu: the problem is that your filesystem is a lying liar.
[18:04] isaacs: it says it's unix, but it's actually windows.
[18:04] isaacs: so it's trying to do things that are supported in unix, but then they fail.
[18:04] markq: :O
[18:04] lietu: well, no-one is really asking it ;)
[18:04] isaacs: npm asks process.platform
[18:05] torvalamo: oh snap
[18:05] isaacs: which exposes us to this problem.
[18:05] isaacs: right?
[18:05] isaacs: because platform !== fs
[18:05] torvalamo: get yer pitch forks and yer torches
[18:05] markq: unix wannabe
[18:05] lietu: so you're saying if I mount a fat32 at /, it will work? ;)
[18:05] markq: windows ain't part of da club
[18:05] sarlalian: fat32 doesn't support symlinks, but ntfs does
[18:05] ioparadigm: lietu, that is why if you mount linux share instead, you can do all unix things you want in your source folder, like create the symlinks and npm will work, that is the solution i found
[18:05] lietu: neither does over cifs
[18:06] isaacs: lietu: if it's running non-windows, it assumes that symlinks are supported.
[18:06] lietu: mjeah
[18:06] sarlalian: technically cifs does, but its somewhat new, and not included in samba last I checked
[18:06] TheIronWolf has joined the channel
[18:06] isaacs: lietu: it'd be nice if maybe it just handled this error better, and symlink failures were swallowed somehow.
[18:06] isaacs: lietu: but i dunno.
[18:06] torvalamo: is there no way to check for filesystem instead of platform?
[18:06] isaacs: that sounds like a bad idea, now that i say it.
[18:06] isaacs: torvalamo: the only reliable way to know if symlinks are supported is to try to make one.
[18:06] lietu: torvalamo: manually parsing "mount", maybe? ... but I doubt it
[18:07] isaacs: and, they ARE supported on windows, just in a very wildly different way.
[18:07] torvalamo: yeah but it's not just symlinks
[18:07] isaacs: exactly
[18:07] isaacs: lietu: can you install in a normal folder?  ie, not a cifs samba mount?
[18:07] lietu: mjeah, I've used mklink a few times on ntfs, it's always given me severe headaches
[18:08] patcito has joined the channel
[18:08] stelleg has joined the channel
[18:08] lietu: well, theoretically I could, of course, however I don't want to, since my source folder is automatically backed up from the windows machine, with a service for which I have a single-machine license
[18:08] torvalamo: windows symlinks arent links at all, theyre just normal files with a path in them... which is so stupid it's not even funny :P
[18:08] dilvie has joined the channel
[18:08] MooGoo: you seem to be thinking of Shortcuts
[18:09] torvalamo: no
[18:09] torvalamo: links too
[18:09] lietu: but yeah, apparently I have two options, cp -aL from the ~/.nvm/... -folder to my local node_modules, or configure NODE_PATH to search the ~/.nvm/... folder ... which would you recommend? ;)
[18:09] MooGoo: even the super new ones?
[18:09] torvalamo: dunno, what are the super new ones?
[18:09] lietu: mklink
[18:09] torvalamo: hm
[18:09] MooGoo: ntfs symbolic links
[18:09] torvalamo: never even seen one
[18:09] torvalamo: :P
[18:09] MooGoo: and before that ntfs junction points
[18:09] MooGoo: which are somewhat more limited
[18:09] `3rdEden has joined the channel
[18:10] khrome has joined the channel
[18:10] lietu: mainly they seem to break things at some point, and cause severe issues when you accidentally forget something is an ntfs link
[18:10] torvalamo: this linking talk got me to thinking... isn't there a linking way to make environment paths a bit more efficient?
[18:10] MooGoo: course no one ever uses these things it seems
[18:10] lietu: MooGoo: mainly because they're pretty broken
[18:11] ioparadigm: lietu, ~/.nvm/?
[18:11] lietu: I've tried to use them, now I've got files and folders I can't delete because they're "symbolic links" that point to "nowhere" since I moved the place they were pointing to
[18:11] torvalamo: hahaha
[18:11] MooGoo: heh...Windows has a knack for dissallowing you to delete your own files
[18:12] lietu: ioparadigm: I've used "nvm install" to install node, locally, somewhere under ~/.nvm .. npm install -g seems to install stuff under ~/.nvm/..../node_modules/
[18:12] mattgifford has joined the channel
[18:12] torvalamo: so that may explain my undeletable old programs then
[18:12] torvalamo: or their folders
[18:12] lietu: oh yeah, windows uses that internally, for some files under \windows and \program files etc
[18:12] ioparadigm: lietu, ah, ive never even heard of that

[18:13] lietu: oh
[18:13] MrTopf has joined the channel
[18:13] lietu: I think it's pretty new
[18:13] lietu: I only found it a couple of months ago iirc
[18:13] lietu: the only easy and working way to install node, that I've found
[18:13] ioparadigm: lietu, node is off the chain, i cant keep up
[18:13] lietu: just "nvm install v0.6.7", "nvm use v0.6.7" and "nvm alias v0.6.7 default" and it's done
[18:14] torvalamo: so essentially they implemented symlinks and made them hidden and painful instead of just putting them out there in plain sight being what they are
[18:14] EyePulp: how do nvm and nave compare?
[18:14] lietu: and iirc it was a oneliner to install nvm, maybe add one more line to bashrc or something to make it work permanently
[18:14] ioparadigm: how do you even choose from 20 templating engines :(
[18:14] isaacs: ioparadigm: you just use html.
[18:14] isaacs: ;)
[18:14] lietu: EyePulp: sorry, dunno
[18:14] isaacs: lietu: about this symlink thing...
[18:14] djazz has joined the channel
[18:14] lietu: isaacs: yeah?
[18:15] isaacs: lietu: it looks like maybe we can just skip over that if it fails in the build step.

[18:15] isaacs: lietu: and i'm not very enthused aboutthe prospect of setting up shims for that stuff.
[18:15] isaacs: though, we do have to for windows anyway.
[18:16] isaacs: lietu: can you do your npm installing in windows-native?

[18:21] jgornick has joined the channel
[18:21] ioparadigm: lietu, i really think its nice to create a samba share of / (the entire linux FS) then create a network map from windows, say X: and your backup program could access your source to back it up there

[18:23] secoif: does anyone have a recommendation on the best way to require a private repo without having to commit *my* github credentials into a ssh url in the package.json?
[18:23] ioparadigm: i havent had a problem works great on local network, very fast, you just install samba, use this smb.conf http://pastebin.com/XKStps5n and use smbpasswd -a to create user, windows will auto discov
[18:23] lietu: at some point I'll set up a NAS box with both NFS and Samba access, use most of my files from that instead of from a windows machine, but that's gotta wait at least for the hdd prices to come back down ;)

[18:25] bradleymeck: booyaa|hs are you going to do anything to check when there are multiple versions supported?
[18:25] ioparadigm: lietu, well, not sure why you are so persistent to keep your source on your windows FS
[18:26] booyaa|hs: bradleymeck: yeah... you guys are going to go to v0.6 soon right?
[18:26] lietu: because I've got enough experience with not doing that ;)
[18:26] lietu: ... if it would work well otherwise, I would happily not do it, it does not work as well as having it on the windows fs ;)
[18:26] ioparadigm: lietu, what is the different, linux mount windows or vice versa
[18:26] bradleymeck: booyaa|hs its going through yet another UA testing phase /cry

[18:26] bradleymeck: but yes

[18:41] CrabDude: if say, they're not a top-level dependency
[18:43] bradleymeck: CrabDude, they will duplicate themselves so if mynodemodule/node_modules/a and mynodemodule/node_modules/helper/node_modules/a grab different versions and helper configures / monkey patches a, mynodemodule's a will not see the change

[18:45] CrabDude: bradleymeck: secoif: okay, thx. That's more or less what I assumed, but I'm solving this problem in the browser and James Burke pointed out that some browser-side modules depend upon this, and looking to node for inspiration, I was trying to see if anyone architected their modules this way, or if it was simply a broken architecture to be discouraged.

[20:54] chrisdickinson: what version of node?
[20:54] eignerchris has joined the channel
[20:54] daynier: latest build
[20:54] shinuza has joined the channel
[20:54] chrisdickinson: huh.
[20:55] chrisdickinson: i'm on 0.6.3, and the try/catch is catching the reference error in my repl.
[20:55] daynier: sorry, 0.4.9
[20:55] daynier: yeah, I'll upgrade.
[20:55] daynier: Let me try it on this box and see how it handles.
[20:56] chrisdickinson: daynier: even works on my copy of 0.4.11.
[20:56] daynier: Whats the latest working version on ubuntu?
[20:56] torvalamo: any version
[20:57] chilts: daynier: I have 0.6.7 running here
[20:57] chilts: ACTION uses nvm to upgrade pretty quickly
[20:57] daynier: guess I gotta tinker with apt-get
[20:57] benlyn has joined the channel
[20:57] torvalamo: no
[20:57] chrisdickinson: also nave, also n.
[20:57] chrisdickinson: i wouldn't use apt-get, in this case.
[20:58] daynier: got a better idea?
[20:58] torvalamo: just download it and ./configure && make && make install
[20:58] chrisdickinson: daynier: use nave, n, or nvm.
[20:58] torvalamo: or tat
[20:58] torvalamo: that*
[20:58] daynier: yeah, I hate that process.
[20:58] daynier: oh well.
[20:58] chilts: daynier: yeah, use one of those - the packages aren't always up to date :)
[20:58] chrisdickinson: daynier: https://gist.github.com/579814
[20:58] daynier: explains a few things.
[20:58] chilts: also, with those tools you don't have to configure, make, make install etc
[20:58] daynier: while I've got your attention
[20:59] daynier: so vm doesn't run async?
[20:59] chrisdickinson: daynier: no, it's blocking.
[20:59] daynier: no wonder my benchmarking was way too high.
[20:59] torvalamo: even if the script has async in it? does it run its own event loop or what?
[20:59] chrisdickinson: (it's roughly equivalent to `eval` or `new Function`, except it potentially (if used with "inNewContext") sets up a whole new javascript context)
[20:59] ByteCrunch has joined the channel
[21:00] chrisdickinson: no, it all runs in your current event loop.
[21:00] daynier: yeah, it does
[21:00] daynier: wow
[21:00] daynier: damn, not good at all.
[21:00] autarch has joined the channel
[21:00] chrisdickinson: if you want it in it's own event loop, you would want to `fork` and run it in a new process.
[21:00] autarch: is there any sort of convention for writing docs for node libraries?
[21:00] tkaemming has joined the channel
[21:00] daynier: okay, so how could I pass along a request while still giving the script access?
[21:00] autarch: most of the stuff listed on npmjs.org seems to just have docs in the form of a README.md on github
[21:00] torvalamo: yeah i would prefer forking over sandbox
[21:00] autarch: which seems kind of sad
[21:01] chrisdickinson: torvalamo: i'd probably go fork + sandbox.
[21:01] chrisdickinson: that way you can restrict access to `require` and friends.
[21:01] torvalamo: not a bad idea
[21:01] chrisdickinson: also, for fun, you could pass it through `burrito` and disable certain constructs.
[21:01] chrisdickinson: (loops, calls, etc.)
[21:01] chilts: autarch: hey, another PerlMonger ... we're few and far between around here :)
[21:02] Aikar: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=aT8lJEgEuTk
[21:02] chilts: mostly Rubyists ... though I guess lots of other people
[21:02] autarch: chilts: I'm _so_ missing cpan
[21:02] tomtomaso has joined the channel
[21:02] pauls1 has joined the channel
[21:02] autarch: not just cpan the site, but the whole convention of "write docs in modules with POD", etc
[21:02] chilts: autarch: I'm pretty used to npm now ... though yeah, the quantity isn't quite there yet
[21:02] chrisdickinson: daynier: so, your goal is to run untrusted code in the vm sandbox that has access to the request object?
[21:02] chrisdickinson: (just to make sure we're on the same page.)
[21:02] autarch: it's not just quantity, npmjs.org is not even a fraction as useful as metacpan
[21:02] chilts: true ... I haven't quite figured out the convention yet either ... I mostly do README.md as you said above
[21:03] daynier: nah its trusted code
[21:03] torvalamo: you don't get to be on the same page! you don't have access to the book!
[21:03] chilts: there was a thread on the mailing list recently
[21:03] daynier: basically kicking apache aside
[21:03] autarch: README.md just doesn't seem sufficient for what I'm doing
[21:03] chrisdickinson: daynier: then why use the `vm` sandbox?
[21:03] autarch: I'm working on a port of Moose to JS, it needs more than one manual apge
[21:03] daynier: Saw it was easier on the lines of code
[21:03] daynier: Plus it worked out well
[21:03] chrisdickinson: ACTION is confused.
[21:04] daynier: var sandbox = {'response':response, 'config':config}
[21:04] daynier: allowed me to block access to the process.exit that would kill my server
[21:04] mattgifford has joined the channel
[21:04] torvalamo: so it's not trusted then

[21:04] autarch: chilts: what was the thread title? do you know?
[21:04] chilts: autarch: I think many larger modules have their own sites (or github pages)
[21:04] chilts: autarch: was just looking for it ... not found it yet
[21:05] eignerchris has joined the channel
[21:05] autarch: fwiw, I'm not actually writing this for Node so much as for client-side stuff
[21:05] torvalamo: there's a module for that
[21:05] autarch: but I'd like to package it for npm since it's basically environment agnostic
[21:05] autarch: I imagine people writing server side code might find this useful
[21:05] MatthewS has joined the channel
[21:05] chrisdickinson: daynier: if you want to block access to it (which leads me to believe the code isn't really trusted), you could always just shim it -- `_exit = process.exit; process.exit = new Function;`,  -- so only your code can call process.exit.

[21:06] horieyui has joined the channel
[21:06] torvalamo: but that can be exploited
[21:06] daynier: chrisdickinson: Totally new to the vm
[21:06] Aikar: you should def not run untrusted code in your main process. spin up a child to do it
[21:07] daynier: chrisdickinson: Normally I would have spawned a new process and ran the code, but I wanted to see what could be done.
[21:07] chilts: autarch: try this one 
[21:07] chilts:         var second;
[21:07] chilts: oopse
[21:07] chilts:         var second;
[21:07] Aikar: var chld = cp.fork('runner.js'). child.send({run: 'somecode'});
[21:07] chilts: heh
[21:07] autarch: pasting is hard
[21:07] chrisdickinson: +1 on what Aikar said.
[21:07] chilts: http://goo.gl/uIpjL
[21:07] chilts: :(
[21:07] Aikar: so if they kill that child, so what
[21:08] heatxsink has joined the channel
[21:08] daynier: chrisdickinson: I'm really just trying to reproduce my cms's structure in node.
[21:08] chrisdickinson: with the addition that `runner.js` would use `vm` to sandbox the code -- remove the ability to `require`, etc.
[21:08] chilts: autarch: one thing I like about npm is how easy it is to upload in comparison to CPAN
[21:08] Aikar: yea
[21:08] daynier: chrisdickinson: Its multisite
[21:08] autarch: chilts: yeah, that does seem better
[21:08] chilts: though I didn't really get into that as much as I have in this community
[21:08] torvalamo: daynier, you should still adapt to node's way of things.. don't port things directly... never a good idea
[21:08] autarch: but the actual module pages are not very useful
[21:09] daynier: Nah, now porting. Rewrite from scratch.
[21:09] daynier: Just keep the same concept of easy use
[21:09] chilts: some are nice
[21:09] autarch: without some sort of standard doc format there's not much the site can do, of course
[21:09] torvalamo: making child processes is cheap enough

[22:56] EyePulp: my server.js has a process.on('unhandledException, function(err){â€¦});    locally, when I intentionally throw an error, the handler works fine.  on my remote boxes, the handler starts to work (watching console messages to verify), but then I get a "Exception in cluster master process:" and the handler doesn't complete, and the whole process gets reloaded.  Using 0.6.6 locally and remotely, and this is a worker in a cluster.

[23:15] sirwan has joined the channel
[23:15] EyePulp: so if I'm intentionally throwing an error within a worker, in my local dev environment, when I capture/handle the unhandledException, it shows that I'm on the worker's pid.  but on our production box, same code is showing it's on the master process.
[23:15] theycallmeswift: I ran into a situation where someone was using the `some` function on objects but it wasn't defined
[23:15] theycallmeswift: so i figured the same could hold true for filter or forEach
[23:16] AvianFlu: filter and forEach are in the ecma5 spec, and therefore in node
