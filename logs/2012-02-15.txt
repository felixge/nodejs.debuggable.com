[00:08] dlg: ;)
[00:08] konobi: diverdude: use the same port
[00:08] diverdude: konobi: but the 1 server is apache and the other is nodejs...how can they then share port?

[00:10] ryanrolds_w: its just easier, fewer switches
[00:10] konobi: diverdude: you can reverse-proxy based on URL path
[00:10] skeptic: diverdude, when connecting to port 80 are you specifying the port in the URL or just using it by default?
[00:10] abrams has joined the channel
[00:10] diverdude: skeptic: im using it by default
[00:11] skeptic: It's not normally suppose to make the cookie port specific when a port isn't specifically set, however this is a grey area

[02:14] EvRide1 has joined the channel
[02:14] kubix: Everywhere I look to find out why this "event-driven" model is so fantastic I read that it doesn't wait on IO (non-blocking) and then proceeds to give an example of a thread waiting on IO.
[02:14] lohkey has joined the channel
[02:15] kubix: But this is the whole point of threads.  A thread that is blocked/waiting is put to sleep and other threads which aren't waiting use the server resources.  So how is node.js any more efficient?
[02:17] chilts: kubix: it may or may not be fantastic to you ... but give it a go and find out for yourself :)
[02:18] wink_ has joined the channel
[02:18] kubix: In fact if your code requires some sort of concurrency (get request -> fetch from DB -> write to file) then doesn't it actually waste CPU cycles to be checking those latter two functions until the first completes?
[02:20] chilts: in your example, you'd do a 'get' and when the response came back your code would be called back, then you'd do the DB call (and again your code would tell you when that has completed)
[02:20] kubix: chilts:  I'm just trying to wrap my head around it.  It's bringing back memories of old-school GUI programming and the "Windows Message Pump"
[02:20] chilts: in the meantime, the rest of the code carries on serving requests and doing other things like talking to the filesystem, redis, mongodb, memcache etc
[02:20] louissmit has joined the channel
[02:20] chilts: yeah, it's kinda like that in the fact that the language tells you when something needs to be done :)

[02:26] ogbuluij has joined the channel
[02:27] kubix: chilts:  OK...so I get that your code carries on serving other requests while waiting on IO.  What I DON'T understand is the implication that in the threaded model your code is not processing other requests.  It isn't processing within the CURRENT thread but your code IS processing within OTHER threads...right?
[02:27] benvie: in the windows message pump you spend most of your time being blocked at GetMessage'
[02:27] benvie: the UI thread blocks
[02:28] benvie: in javascript the main thread specifically doesn't and can't block
[02:28] icewhite_ has joined the channel
[02:28] benvie: well it can, but if it does then it would manifest in a frozen UI in the browser
[02:29] chilts: generally I don't do things with threads in nodejs ... I either have a different process (doing a completely different thing) or I push that 'work-to-be-done' on some queue somewhere for later processing
[02:29] chilts: presuming it doesn't have to be done now of course :)
[02:30] kubix: benvie:  That does explain why the windows UI (namely explorer) appears to freeze while it's authenticating or enumerating files/folders...
[02:30] tec27: kubix, the advantage of node isn't necessarily that its more efficient thatn doing things in a multi-threaded way
[02:31] tec27: the big thing about it is that you can program these highly responsive programs without needing to worry about all of the problems that come along with concurrency
[02:32] pendlepants has joined the channel
[02:32] ashishg has joined the channel
[02:32] tec27: granted, event loops tend to be a lot more efficient as well, since they don't have as much overhead as doing things explicitly multi-threaded
[02:32] benvie: the point is that javascript from the beginning has existed in an environment where it was a guest inside something else's event loop and it couldn't block, so all usage and code and libraries and whatnot conform to the expectation that it won't block
[02:33] benvie: the browser window itself, which hosts javascript, has its own event loop for tending to the rendering of the frame. So javascript can't sit there in an infinite loop doing whatever it wants
[02:33] SubStack: browser javascript is actual less pure about an event system than node
[02:33] SubStack: because you've got stuff like confirm() and alert()
[02:33] kubix: So it's advantage is much like the OO model over the procedural one in that it gives developers a mental framework for writing better code?  Meaning that coders working in the threaded model may tend to "wait" whereas they might not have to?
[02:34] benvie: twisted python gives an example of the issue arising from culture
[02:35] benvie: there's a whole set of existing libraries and frameworks and crap in python but as with most languages there's no heed paid to blocking vs. non-blocking so it makes those unusable
[02:35] SubStack: the culture angle is a really strong effect in node's benefit
[02:35] kubix: That actually makes some sense.
[02:35] benvie: you don't know if some random library you include will block which makes it unusable for an asynchronous higher level construct
[02:35] SubStack: and people expect javascript to execute in a single context
[02:36] langworthy has joined the channel
[02:36] tec27: kubix: the biggest thing is that if you ask like *anyone* who has worked with code for a while what the hardest bugs to diagnose are, they'll tell you bugs due to concurrency
[02:36] SubStack: so much so that stuff like setTimeout and setInterval are baked into any runtime
[02:36] context: i execute ALL javascript
[02:36] tec27: its something so absurdly hard to get right
[02:36] benvie: basically async vs. sync is kind of all or nothing, so if you can't enforce it someway it makes asynchronous untenable
[02:36] kubix: I guess I should have apologized in advance.  I'm not a developer per-se but like to "grok" the development world and node has created some considerable ripples (i.e. this isn't just a "fad")
[02:36] benvie: in JS it's enforced by it being so engrained and fundamental in JS's usage and history
[02:37] SubStack: I like how functions are things
[02:37] SubStack: things that you can easily store for later
[02:37] SubStack: or restructure in all the usual ways
[02:37] SubStack: not so with approaches like coroutines or generators
[02:38] shiawuen has joined the channel
[02:38] benvie: asynchronous is beneficial to usage when your IO bound. No matter what you're doing, whenever you move from the CPU to something else as the bottleneck it instantly costs 1000x as much time or more.
[02:39] benvie: in js the IO originally was the human using the browser, but it applies to filesystems and networks the same
[02:39] LBRapid_ has joined the channel
[02:39] icewhite has joined the channel
[02:39] SubStack: the kernel is asynchronous anyways
[02:39] SubStack: using interrupt requests
[02:40] kasatk has joined the channel
[02:41] benvie: yeah you actually have to do some extra work generally to actually block execution while waiting on stuff. But that's supported at a pretty low level
[02:41] ryan1_: yeah?
[02:41] ryan1_: opps
[02:41] ryan1_: meant to write that to someone else 
[02:41] kubix: benvie:  OK but aren't there some inherent risks to ditching the threaded model?  For example threads ensure that a request can't "run away" with the processor.  Wouldn't having a loop such as "while true {; WasteCPUCycles(); }; inside a callback pretty much grind a node process to a halt?  And without other threads wouldn't the whole server go down with it?
[02:42] hipertracker_ has joined the channel
[02:42] SubStack: kubix: sure
[02:42] benvie: yeah and it does
[02:42] SubStack: it's something to watch out for
[02:43] chilts: but that's no different to having 20 Apache children all looping and grinding to an even bigger halt :)
[02:43] tec27: it can do that with threads too though, you just lose a member of your thread pool instead
[02:43] benvie: while(true){} in js is very different than elsewhere
[02:43] xaq has joined the channel
[02:43] benvie: in js you will consume 100% of the cpu (or that core_
[02:43] kubix: chilts:  execve bomb you mean?
[02:43] chilts: many of the problems people assign to node can happen with whatever language/server
[02:43] chilts: kubix: indeed, it's easy to fire off a few thousand requests to a server
[02:43] chilts: you're more likely to survive it with Node than Apache :)
[02:44] chilts: (if that's your only defense of course) :D
[02:44] benvie: or if it fails it's going to be something not in node directly that fails
[02:44] EvRide has joined the channel
[02:44] benvie: because the work is mostly being done elsewhere
[02:44] benvie: and node isn't waiting around to find out
[02:44] chilts: I always think of Node as a puppetmaster, just controlling other things as and when it gets tiny messages :D
[02:44] benvie: yeah I like to call javascript the brain language
[02:45] chilts: SubStack: would that ^^^ be a good picture? ;)
[02:45] chilts: (line before last) :D
[02:45] SubStack: hah
[02:45] benvie: it makes an awesome foreman/controller because it's suited to telling other things what to do
[02:45] kubix: chilts:  I absolutely agree, from my limited insight, that node should be able to better survive peak demand (or a botnet) better than Apache because it's not committing as many resources per connection.  However, I was thinking more within the code than from the network.
[02:45] chilts: ACTION would be honored :D
[02:45] benvie: while sitting there doing no hard work of its own
[02:45] benvie: well it can do that now moreso
[02:45] chilts: yeah, true, within the code ... but no matter which programming language you use, you have to be careful of stuff
[02:46] benvie: but still you're better offloading really computationally expensive things
[02:46] chilts: just because you're using node, doesn't mean you can take your brain otu :D

[02:46] chilts: absolutely, you have to hand off large computations ... but the best thing is, it's easier to get a pingback telling you when it's done :D

[02:47] kubix: chilts:  I'm not endorsing brain-dead coding.  I'm just saying that there's higher impact of an unexpected intensive loop because there aren't threads for the OS to balance CPU usage with.
[02:47] briancray has joined the channel
[02:48] chilts: I usually have a few node processes serving the same site, so that's pretty much similar to what child processes in Apache are :)
[02:48] chilts: so the OS balances them fine
[02:48] kubix: chilts: I was referring to the bug or CPU-killer loop being within your pingback.
[02:48] chilts: (well, in some cases Nginx does) :)
[02:48] mrkurt has joined the channel
[02:48] chilts: kubix: yeah, fair enough ... but no code I have written would do that since I understand how Node works
[02:49] chilts: so that's your choice, you can do that and stop serving requests to anyone else, or you hand it off
[02:49] chilts: you understand the technology to make those decisions
[02:49] kubix: chilts:  Never say never.  Maybe it's just me but I've made enough mistakes I "never" should have back in the day.
[02:49] chilts: :)
[02:50] chilts: as another example, much code I write in node responds _faster_ to requests, since I ask Redis/Memcache/SimpleDB etc things in parrallel rather than in sequence, and therefore the requester gets their page/result in a quicker time :)

[03:35] wingie: i thought i would do regular HTTP requests
[03:36] chilts: up to you .. my library works quite nicely (though I'm biased): e.g. to create a distribution : https://github.com/appsattic/node-awssum/blob/master/examples/amazon/cloudfront/create-distribution.js

[03:40] chilts: and create the XML
[03:40] wingie: what do you mean?
[03:41] chilts: you need to sign any request you send to the API

[03:43] wingie: in terms of userfriendlyness, power etc
[03:44] wingie: have you compared pricing?
[03:44] chilts: I only use RS for servers so I can't comprehensively compare
[03:44] wingie: ok
[03:44] chilts: yeah, but pricing isn't as much of an issue for me
[03:44] wingie: why aren't you using AWS for that as well?
[03:44] wingie: rich?

I'm wondering how to do the cool middleware stuff while still taking advantage of the new organization/structure

[06:56] strager: lowkey_: v0.1.6.0 isn't a version of Node.js.
[06:56] strager: And your comment got cut off in the middle of the Github link.
[06:57] lowkey_: @strager -- correction v0.6.0
[06:57] lowkey_: The github refers to the npm repo here http://search.npmjs.org/#/express-mvc-bootstrap
[06:57] strager: lowkey_: That package claims it only works with 0.5.0 https://github.com/cliftonc/express-mvc-bootstrap/blob/master/package.json#L27
[06:57] strager: You have several options.
[06:57] strager: Force an install (npm install -f)
[06:58] strager: Change your Node version to something older (I don't recommend this)
[06:58] strager: Fork the project and reference that project (after fixing it up for 0.6.x)
[06:58] strager: Use some other package.
[06:59] lowkey_: I would prefer to stay as up to date as possible on node. I will try to force install as a first step.
[06:59] strager: I think express includes its own project generation tool.
[06:59] gkatsev has joined the channel
[06:59] strager: You probably don't want/need to stay "as up to date as possible" with Node.js.
[07:00] strager: You'll probably just upgrade every even (stable) minor version (0.6.x, 0.8.x) unless you need a bug fixed in some version or a feature starting from some version.
[07:00] strager: Otherwise it'll be a headache.  (People on 0.7.x are hurt by tons of packages claiming support for only stable branches of Node.)

[07:05] lowkey_: @strager, so I tried the npm force install option but it fails with a similar error message to one I was getting earlier until I downgraded to v0.6.0 (new error http://paste.pocoo.org/show/551261/)  I think my only option is to downgrade to v0.5.0 if I want to get this to work. Is this a bad Idea?
[07:05] diverdude: Im trying to make a socket.io connection on the client like this: var socket = io.connect("http://mydomain.dev",{ resource: "chathandler" }); but i get an error saying: "transports is undefined" in socket.io.js (line 1630) - so in the client side. What am I missing?
[07:06] mytrile has joined the channel
[07:06] strager: lowkey_: I'd say scrap that project or figure it out and patch it.
[07:06] EhevuTov: diverdude, isn't a resource just a name of the kind of transport you're wanting?

[07:08] lowkey_: @strager, okay thanks for the assistance. I'm not sure if I could patch it myself. I'll try to reach out to the author to see if he has any ideas. (Maybe I should dig in to see what's broken - I might learn something)
[07:09] strager: lowkey_: Be sure to send a pull request if you do patch it so everyone can benefit.  =]
[07:09] EhevuTov: diverdude, I don't see anything like that in the docs. I thought the resource had to be 'socket.io'
[07:09] diverdude: EhevuTov: yeah but im experiencing this problem: https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io-client/issues/362
[07:10] diverdude: EhevuTov: and the socket.io guy there says to use resource to specify the directory
[07:10] BrainScraps has joined the channel
[07:10] EhevuTov: oh I see
[07:11] diverdude: but in the docs it says
[07:11] diverdude: The resource is what allows the socket.io server to identify incoming connections by socket.io clients. In other words, any HTTP server can implement socket.io and still serve other normal, non-realtime HTTP requests.
[07:11] diverdude: and then the options is mentioned to be ['websocket', 'flashsocket', 'htmlfile', 'xhr-multipart', 'xhr-polling', 'jsonp-polling']
[07:11] diverdude: very confusing
[07:12] EhevuTov: can you not do something like: var socket1 = io.connect( 'http://localhost/resource1' );  var socket2 = io.connect( 'http://localhost'/resource2 ); 
[07:12] diverdude: EhevuTov: no
[07:12] jacobolus has joined the channel
[07:12] EhevuTov: diverdude, why not? Is that the nature of the HTTP web socket?
[07:13] diverdude: EhevuTov: the connector completely ignores resource1 and resource2
[07:13] diverdude: EhevuTov: it parses the input uri and extrats the domain and the port and ignores the resource

[07:21] diverdude: yes

[07:22] konobi: so io.connect("http://mydomain.dev/", { resource: "chathandler" })
[07:22] diverdude: konobi: then i get an error saying transports is undefined

[07:24] diverdude: that still gives transports is undefined
[07:25] diverdude: YES 
[07:25] diverdude: I DID IT
[07:25] diverdude: the solution was { resource: "chathandler/socket.io" }
[07:25] diverdude: and by setting up a reverse proxy i solved the whole problem now :D

[07:26] EhevuTov: diverdude, what made you think that would work
[07:26] diverdude: ofc. with help form ppl :D
[07:27] diverdude: EhevuTov: i figured it still needed to look up the socket.io resource even though it was inside chathandler
[07:27] diverdude: and that was it :D
[07:27] EhevuTov: ah. i would of guessed something different. Is that documented somewhere?
[07:28] diverdude: EhevuTov: no where
[07:28] diverdude: not that i know of at least
[07:28] konobi: on the server it's probably listening on /socket.io (by default)
[07:28] diverdude: now console.dir(data.headers.cookie); prints:  'CAKEPHP=qctvih43ip5j6g4no0ap2shfp0' and NOT undefined :P

[14:24] trakowski77: hello everyone. I've just started playing with node.js and I'm looking for some help regarding simple html templating. I'm coming from the PHP world, if you want to draw any parallels. 
[14:24] trakowski77: I'm looking at https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules#wiki-templating
[14:24] trakowski77: too many options 
[14:24] josh-k has joined the channel
[14:25] timoxley: trakowski77 you want specifically wiki style templating?
[14:25] timoxley: what are you building? and what template engines have you used before?
[14:26] trakowski77: I'm looking testing, and I'm looking at a simple way for an integrator to write html 
[14:26] trakowski77: add tags, a bit like in php
[14:26] r04r has joined the channel
[14:27] trakowski77: and use that within nodejs to output the response
[14:27] lduros has joined the channel
[14:27] trakowski77: so I'm not writing anything in particular, just exploring how things are done in node.js
[14:27] timoxley: ok
[14:27] timoxley: trakowski77 have you considered client-side templating?
[14:28] cam|work: use jquery's template system
[14:28] davidsklar has joined the channel
[14:28] cam|work: on the client side
[14:28] timoxley: gross
[14:28] cam|work: ur gross
[14:28] timoxley: ha
[14:28] heavysixer has joined the channel
[14:28] trakowski77: Nope. I know jquery 
[14:28] cam|work: i use the jquery templating with knockout
[14:28] cam|work: seems fairly simple
[14:29] trakowski77: Yeah, I'm not  looking for the dynamic part of things yet.
[14:29] trakowski77: although, my approach is likely completely wrong cause I think in php ways.
[14:29] Edy: i use jqtpl too
[14:30] timoxley: jquery templates are a bit too simple. loops are ugly.
[14:30] Edy: with express and knockout
[14:30] jtsnow has joined the channel
[14:30] trakowski77: So basically when you say client side, you consider that to be completely separate from you node.js application right ?
[14:31] timoxley: yeah
[14:31] cam|work: node would be the server
[14:31] trakowski77: but in terms of project structure. 
[14:31] cam|work: your clients are connecting to it
[14:31] timoxley: perhaps the client-side code is generated by node
[14:31] trakowski77: clients being mobile devices, websites etc.

[14:34] wankdanker has joined the channel
[14:35] trakowski77: nope... how costly is such server html generation ?
[14:35] timoxley: trakowski77 it generates it once

[14:35] timoxley: trakowski77 so not at all

[14:38] Poetro has joined the channel
[14:38] trakowski77: everything appears flipped upside down, but the code can be understood fairly easily.. 
[14:38] timoxley: trakowski77 I think people rely a lot on modules and do a lot of gluing of components
[14:38] trakowski77: Yeah, i've used formidable in one of my examples
[14:39] trakowski77: In terms of internals, the whole thing basically runs as a single threaded app 
[14:40] trakowski77: and you have to fork new processes to achieve non blocking long calls .. 
[14:41] icebox has joined the channel
[14:41] blax has joined the channel
[14:41] FIQ has joined the channel
[14:41] timoxley: trakowski77 spot on. Though typically your first port of call is to break your long call up into smaller units of work.
[14:41] trakowski77: basically, in PHP, apache with worker mode was handling all that for me. In node, that's part of my app.
[14:41] timoxley: trakowski77 what kind of 'long calls' are you imagining?
[14:42] trakowski77: I do no know, a mysql query
[14:42] hhutch has left the channel
[14:42] timoxley: nah
[14:42] trakowski77: can potentially by long 
[14:42] timoxley: I mean
[14:42] timoxley: maybe if you're running a big ass report
[14:42] timoxley: yeah
[14:42] timoxley: actually
[14:42] timoxley: wtf am i saying.
[14:42] timoxley: no
[14:42] timoxley: not at all.
[14:42] trakowski77: hmm.. 
[14:43] timoxley: trakowski77 you send off the request to mysql
[14:43] timoxley: trakowski77 your app continues on serving requests
[14:43] bkaney has joined the channel
[14:43] r04r has joined the channel
[14:43] timoxley: trakowski77 and when the mysql result is ready it will give you the results
[14:44] trakowski77: OK, so it's handled internally in a non-blocking way
[14:44] timoxley: trakowski77 yep
[14:44] trakowski77: nice 
[14:44] blax: unless you use synced mysql methods ;)
[14:44] timoxley: trakowski77 I believe it's more a feature of ecma script than node specifically
[14:45] timoxley: trakowski77 do some googling on 'nodejs event loop'
[14:45] timoxley: trakowski77 understanding that is the key to not being confused.
[14:45] timoxley: trakowski77 by async.
[14:45] trakowski77: It's similar to an async XHR request.. 
[14:46] hipsterslapfight: yes
[14:46] timoxley: trakowski77 exactly
[14:46] [g2} has joined the channel
[14:46] trakowski77: I've done a LOT of pre-framework js, so async calls are not new to me. It's just getting over the server side of things. 
[14:47] MELts2 has joined the channel
[14:47] MELts2: How I can share an object array between different servers in node?
[14:47] timoxley: MELts2 perhaps explain why you want to do that
[14:48] trakowski77: memcached ? :)
[14:49] MELts2: I have an array of connected clients and want balanced on different servers
[14:50] timoxley: MELts2 your could simply have your main process emit add/remove events out to the different servers
[14:50] timoxley: MELts2 via socketio
[14:50] artusrocha has joined the channel
[14:51] r04r has joined the channel
[14:51] blax: another question: is there any possibility to have socket identifier collisions?
[14:51] timoxley: trakowski77 these days I think most people use redis where a few years ago you would have used memcached.
[14:51] mandric has joined the channel
[14:51] trakowski77: is not redis still slower ?
[14:52] MELts2: thanks timoxley
[14:52] diva has joined the channel
[14:52] trakowski77: In PHP, the problem with redis is the lack of a good stable driver. Memcached is true and tested, whereas redis is always risky. Have not looked at redis in a long time 
[14:53] malletjo has joined the channel
[14:53] blax: is it possible that ,let's say, one client comes and triggers some long lasting operation (like db call) and then disappears immediately, then another client accidentally connects to the socket with same identifier and receives result from the previous call?
[14:53] c4milo has joined the channel
[14:53] timoxley: trakowski77 afaik there's much more redis tooling in node than memcached
[14:54] timoxley: trakowski77 apparently redis is on-par if not faster than memcached
[14:54] timoxley: trakowski77 and much more flexible
[14:55] trakowski77: One more thing, as far as mysql goes, which driver should I use. I'm looking at a whole list of them .. 
[14:55] trakowski77: I'm not interested in ORM at the moment. 
[14:55] trakowski77: just low lever query execution 
[14:55] trakowski77: I see node-mysql 
[14:56] timoxley: trakowski77 no idea, I've never used mysql with node
[14:56] trakowski77: heh .. 
[14:56] r04r has joined the channel
[14:57] trakowski77: heh, i know it integrates well with say mongo....  but I want to build a similar app in node and php and compare speed, code time, complexity and such.. 
[14:58] mschneider has joined the channel
[14:58] trakowski77: But to be honest, as far as speed of execution, on a simple "hello world" there is no speed advantage to either php or node. They both ran at about 5k req/sec for me
[14:59] DuoSRX has joined the channel
[14:59] trakowski77: I'm trying to see if there are any advantages in node, such as parallelism, to get gains impossible in php. 
[15:00] timoxley: trakowski77 evented systems only really show their magic when you're doing IO bound operations such as reading from disk or network
[15:00] redir has joined the channel
[15:00] trakowski77: yeah, but a single request is still bound by IO. 
[15:01] trakowski77: I mean, yeah, you're not blocking other requests
[15:01] trakowski77: but you're not blocking them in php either, because each request is a separate process. 
[15:02] timoxley: trakowski77 in node, hello world is blocking.
[15:02] timoxley: your code blocks, io doesn't.
[15:03] trakowski77: yeah, but it's very fast, so basically insignificant.

[15:06] themiddleman_itv has joined the channel
[15:06] trakowski77: What I'm trying to say, say you have a url, where there is an IO operation being executed... and that the IO operation takes 1 sec... node will accept the request, and will start the operation in the background, and serve other requests while IO operation is being completed. However that original request is going to take 1 sec to complete. It will not block other requests from coming through... It's essentially the same end result as in P

[15:09] aheckmann has joined the channel
[15:10] trakowski77: is there a way for node to take advantage of multicore servers ?
[15:10] trakowski77: I'm just reading something about it. Could be old
[15:10] timoxley: trakowski77 built-in cluster support
[15:10] davidwalsh has joined the channel
[15:11] timoxley: trakowski77 the thing is with your example there, node can service 100s if not thousands of other requests while it's waiting for that IO
[15:11] timoxley: trakowski77 and you don't need a separate process for each one
[15:11] skyler_brungardt has joined the channel
[15:12] timoxley: = higher throughput with less resources
[15:14] bizniz98 has joined the channel
[15:16] trakowski77: timoxley: I would expect nothing less than > 1000 simultaneous requests a sec. ;). I mean I can get that with PHP already (when not using stupid frameworks). Yeah, multi-process handling can be costly, but php/apache has ways of dealing with that. Starting up processes ahead of time, maintaining a certain amount of them up and running at all times, and spinning up new ones ahead of time. 
[15:16] joshkehn has joined the channel
[15:16] joshkehn has left the channel
[15:17] trakowski77: The advantage of separate processes is a bit better isolation between separate requests. in node if i have a single badly coded section, it affects the whole app. In php, every url is basically handled by a separate process, which does not affect other urls. yeah, in extreme situation it will still kill you server, but it is not instant. 
[15:18] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[15:18] timoxley: trakowski77 that is a tradeoff
[15:18] trakowski77: node requires better programmers :)

Ruby, Python are all more organized, consistent and more complete languages, but are not really faster and in many cases slower. Anyways, I'm giving node a honest try to see if it is the right time to move on... but I need to see clear advantages... 
[15:31] baudehlo has joined the channel

[20:03] Mortchek: Is it possible to save the current state of a JS VM to a file so it can be resumed later?
[20:03] isaacs: node javascript point organism
[20:03] TheJH: Mortchek, in v8? I think you can't do that
[20:04] Topcat has joined the channel
[20:05] ajackbot has joined the channel
[20:05] Mortchek: TheJH, thanks. Do you know of any pertinent docs I could read that might give that information if it existed?
[20:06] TheJH: Mortchek, no
[20:06] context: 3/ca
[20:06] context: damnit
[20:07] erichynds has joined the channel
[20:07] TheJH: Mortchek, hmm... you want to halt and later continue the JS VM? With or without restarting the host OS?
[20:07] Mortchek: TheJH, without.
[20:07] saurb has joined the channel
[20:07] Mortchek: TheJH, maybe I've gotten ahead of myself:
[20:07] TheJH: Mortchek, well, why don't you just use SIGSTOP and SIGCONT?
[20:07] Mortchek: TheJH, mainly what I want is to be able to keep callbacks associated with objects while serializing them.
[20:08] context: mortchek: their are ways to do that im pretty sure, but stuff like open i/o ports are not gonna remain of course
[20:08] TheJH: Mortchek, like, for network stuff? or really just for resuming?
[20:08] context: and im not sure how well the vm itself will handle that. but their are ways to do a dump of the memory and reload it and continue execution
[20:09] Mortchek: Network doesn't matter. All that matters is that I can stop then restart the server while preserving any events tied to these objects.
[20:09] serby has joined the channel
[20:09] TheJH: Mortchek, why do you have to pause it? and why don't you use SIGSTOP and SIGCONT?
[20:09] context: though it'd prolly be easier to find your own way of preserving them, dump to some file you can read later
[20:10] TheJH: Mortchek, tell us what you want, not how you want to do it :P
[20:10] context: thejh++
[20:10] catb0t: TheJH now has 1 beer
[20:10] Mortchek: TheJH, yep, I know. I did mention what I wanted.
[20:10] Mortchek: TheJH, I'm sorry I didn't say it outright.
[20:10] context: no you said how you want to do it
[20:10] TheJH: Mortchek, sorry, but I still don't understand your usecase
[20:10] bbbb has joined the channel
[20:11] TheJH: Mortchek, e.g. why you can't just let the VM run. or simply pause it.
[20:11] Destos has joined the channel
[20:12] Mortchek: This is what I wish to do: Stop and restart a Node program while saving the state of any functions stored on certain objects.
[20:12] mhillsman has joined the channel
[20:13] Mortchek: I'm thinking I may have to rethink the way I'm doing this though.
[20:13] context: mortchek: why not just.... stop and restart the app
[20:13] Mortchek: context, I wish to preserve across system reboot.
[20:13] context: what events are attached that cant be re-attached on startup
[20:13] benvie: how about using it the same way v8 uses snapshots
[20:13] Mortchek: benvie, explain?
[20:13] benvie: for hot starting to a specific state
[20:13] benvie: it allows you to start up with a certain configuration instantly
[20:13] Cromulent has joined the channel
[20:13] benvie: many times
[20:13] context: mortchek: how/why does your app not know what state its in and cant attach said events on app startup

[20:14] danzajdband has joined the channel
[20:14] context: BUT he did say earlier without restarting...
[20:14] benvie: well I want to do the same thing too and have looked into it in the past
[20:14] context: so his story is changing already
[20:14] benvie: and that's my use case
[20:14] Mortchek: context, the questions were different.
[20:14] context: pick a question and stick with it
[20:14] benvie: I want to be able to have vm images that I can just start up from
[20:15] benvie: or reproduce 100 times
[20:15] Mortchek: context, no, I mean what was asked of me was different.
[20:15] benvie: it also would allow for an interesting spin on debugging
[20:15] context: benvie: we call that 'fork'
[20:15] Mortchek: All right. I'm realizing I will have to think my problem through more. I will ask again when I've done so.
[20:15] context: which some testing frameworks do
[20:15] Mortchek: Thanks everyone.
[20:16] Eric_ has joined the channel
[20:16] context: mortchek: we understand the question. we dont understand why anyone would want to go through the trouble
[20:16] benvie: none of them save the state of the vm
[20:16] context: benvie: fork replicates the process with the exact same memory
[20:16] benvie: windows
[20:16] context: shutters
[20:16] context: blinds?
[20:16] Mortchek: context, that's why I'm going to rethink what I'm doing, because it seems I'm overcomplicating it.

[20:25] Mortchek: CoverSlide, JSON doesn't include functions.
[20:25] TheJH: Mortchek, aaaah :)
[20:26] Mortchek: I've never tackled this problem before, which is perhaps why I'm confusing myself a bit with it.
[20:26] kmurph79 has joined the channel
[20:26] TheJH: Mortchek, do you know that you can give JSON.parse a custom deserializer function? Maybe you could re-attach the handlers manually on load?
[20:26] mikeal has joined the channel
[20:27] Mortchek: TheJH, I didn't, actually. How would that work across restarts of the program?
[20:27] maxogden: Mortchek: the more conventional approach would be to use a database for persistence
[20:27] alexrbarlow has joined the channel
[20:27] Mortchek: maxogden, understood.
[20:27] Mortchek: My problem is persisting behavior.
[20:28] Mortchek: How do I reliably assign the correct behavior again to the correct entities?
[20:28] TheJH: Mortchek, well, what's the stuff you can't serialize again? Only handlers, right?
[20:28] Mortchek: TheJH, correct.
[20:29] mraxilus has joined the channel
[20:29] alexrbarlow: hey guys
[20:29] maxogden: Mortchek: can you give a concrete example?
[20:29] Mortchek: Sure.
[20:29] TheJH: Mortchek, well, won't each kind of monster or whatever always have the same listeners?
[20:29] Mortchek: When Bob the NPC sees a player enter the site, he walks over to greet the player.
[20:29] Mortchek: So something of this sort:
[20:29] alexrbarlow: so im using express and the built in connect body-parser, and trying to move a file once uploaded, but its saying the file doesnt exist. Is there a way I need to wait for it to be written or something

[20:31] Mortchek: TheJH, perhaps, but there can be uniques.
[20:31] Mortchek: TheJH, that said, that does strike on an idea I had to manage it.
[20:31] Mortchek: TheJH, what I could do is define several behavior classes, and only assign behavior to an NPC based on its behavior class. Then I can store the behavior class, and correct behavior will be reassigned.
[20:31] maxogden: Mortchek: if you design all your npcs as state machines then you only have to write to the database whenever they change state
[20:32] TheJH: Mortchek, that's what I wanted to tell you now :D
[20:32] Mortchek: TheJH, thank you for bringing that up. I think that is what I shall do.

[20:34] maxogden: Mortchek: in your NPC example you will have a stream of location updates coming from the players connection and any NPCs within a certain radius or whatever will change state if the player gets close enough
[20:34] Mortchek: Other than that, thanks everyone for the help. Sorry you had to wade through my crappy initial question; please believe me, my questions are not usually that crappy. :P

[21:17] diverdude: dscape: because otherwise i cannot share cookies between my php app and my socket.io app
[21:17] diverdude: dscape: no im actually using apache to act as reverse proxy
[21:17] TooTallNate: has anybody written an SMB server in node yet?
[21:18] dscape: diverdude: thats an interesting problem but ive never worked on it so idk
[21:18] dscape: i dont know how much of a good idea sharing cookies thru a proxy is though
[21:18] diverdude: dscape: why is that?
[21:18] dscape: due to my ignorance
[21:18] lohkey: from what i hear, apache and nginx fail at proxy'ing websockets
[21:18] dscape: but ive never heard no one tackle that problem by using a reverse proxy
[21:19] diverdude: dscape: the cookies actually works fine...i can read sessions in my socket.app which originates from php
[21:19] intripoon has joined the channel
[21:19] lohkey: diverdude: shouldn't you be sharing sessions … not cookies
[21:19] lohkey: and odds are you don't even need to be sharing sessions
[21:19] diverdude: lohkey: same same i think. im sharing the cookie containing the sessionid
[21:20] lohkey: you could emit the php session id to the socket.io connection
[21:20] lohkey: and then hook onto the session in node.js
[21:20] diverdude: and in my socket.io app i read session from DB using sessionid from cookie
[21:20] jetienne_ has joined the channel
[21:20] lohkey: right
[21:20] lohkey: but you don't need to share cookies for that
[21:20] lohkey: you just emit the session id
[21:21] diverdude: mmm yes. that would require me to read the cookie on the client using javascript
[21:21] diverdude: i think
[21:21] lohkey: yes it would
[21:21] lohkey: but you're already using JS on the client anyways, so it should be trivial
[21:21] diverdude: i think this solution works also
[21:22] diverdude: i dont see why its better to read the cookie in javascript and emit it
[21:22] diverdude: when i can read it in the auth procedure
[21:22] diverdude: from the cookie
[21:22] lohkey: diverdude: less architecture soup
[21:22] diverdude: and deny the client if cookie is invalid
[21:22] lohkey: always apply KISS
[21:22] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[21:23] diverdude: but the problem is actually that i cannot emit
[21:23] diverdude: :)
[21:23] diverdude: for some reason
[21:23] lohkey: yeah, thats because of the reverse proxy though
[21:23] lohkey: i'm almost certain thats why
[21:23] diverdude: yes it is because it works fine if i connect directly without using the proxy
[21:23] zarex has joined the channel
[21:23] lohkey: well there you go
[21:24] lohkey: like i said, i'm fairly certain that you simply can't reverse proxy web sockets with apache or nginx
[21:24] diverdude: but i do not know why the proxy would do that
[21:24] lohkey: because websockets weren't designed to be proxied through http proxies
[21:24] AviMarcus has joined the channel
[21:25] lohkey: the only proxy i've personally heard people having success with using web sockets was HAProxy
[21:25] diverdude: i see. thats a node.js proxy?

[21:28] overthemike has left the channel
[21:28] diverdude: darn
[21:28] lohkey: so if you want to keep using apache as a proxy, emitting the session id is your only option
[21:28] mikeric has joined the channel
[21:29] lohkey: nvm
[21:29] diverdude: but if i have apache as proxy i cannot emit anything...also not the sessionid
[21:29] lohkey: apache aisn't even an option
[21:29] lohkey: yeah i know
[21:29] diverdude: but why can it connect and not emit?
[21:29] colinclark has joined the channel
[21:29] hkjels has joined the channel
[21:30] matehat has joined the channel
[21:30] lohkey: you because the HTTP UPGRADE header gets sent successfully in the first payload
[21:30] lohkey: nothing will make it past after that
[21:30] diverdude: can i ask you what the http upgrade header is
[21:31] lohkey: it's the HTTP header that tells the receiving HTTP server to upgrade the protocol to WebSockets
[21:31] lohkey: it's the same HTTP header used to upgrade HTTP connections to SPDY
[21:31] diverdude: i see
[21:31] lohkey: well, i guess SPDY uses TLS negotiation or something like that too
[21:32] diverdude: hmm maybe i should take at this HAProxy
[21:32] diverdude: instead
[21:32] lohkey: i'd just run node next to apache
[21:32] diverdude: it seems to be a good load balancer also
[21:32] lohkey: or just apache next to HAProxy -> node's
[21:32] diverdude: lohkey: but how then auth the connection?
[21:32] lohkey: diverdude: emit the session id

[21:33] lohkey: the client is already authed, no need to reauth them
[21:33] diverdude: how is it authed?
[21:33] diverdude: *already
[21:33] lohkey: diverdude: if ti's not authed it shouldn't have a valid session id
[21:34] lohkey: depends on how you business logic around auth is setup in php land
[21:34] lohkey: all you'd have to do in node is receive the session id, and validate it against the session store
[21:34] Revernd has joined the channel
[21:34] diverdude: ahh yes exactly. they may only connect to my socket.io server if they are authed in php land
[21:34] diverdude: thats the reason i want to share session
[21:34] lohkey: mhm
[21:35] lohkey: and you can share it just by emitting it and validating against the session store sir
[21:35] diverdude: lohkey: can i see i e.g. wireshark how the http upgrade header is being destroyed by the apache server ?
[21:35] peerpeer has joined the channel
[21:36] lohkey: diverdude: it's not being destroyed
[21:36] lohkey: node should be receiving it

[23:38] maxogden: dunder-mifflin: thats a common antipattern in javascript, the lack of it in some modules doesnt mean it is bad
[23:38] CoverSlide: not sure, but I heard Function.prototype.bind was slower

[23:39] CoverSlide: besides, IE < 9 doesn't have bind

[23:48] RobWC has left the channel
[23:48] chilts: that's kinda like a truncate() I guess
[23:48] chilts: (well, truncate() for numbers) :)
[23:48] Swizec has joined the channel
[23:48] insin: daniel`: which variety of string interpolation are you after?
[23:48] chilts: ACTION can't remember which language he originally saw that in
[23:48] thepatrick: mappum: there's a buffer convenience method ... buffer.readIntLE/BE(offset) for that
[23:49] mappum: thepatrick: yes, but not for 64 bits. so it isn't possible at all? i guess i can just handle up to 53 bit :/
[23:49] ashishg has joined the channel
[23:50] thepatrick: mappum: d'oh, of course. 
[23:50] dunder-mifflin: insin: here's an example that i find more readable https://github.com/senchalabs/cssbeautify/blob/master/cssbeautify.js , here's one with lots of self. reference https://github.com/cloudhead/vows/blob/master/lib/vows.js .. it is easy once you know that there's only one var self = this, but when i debug an error, i usually start from a line, and then i see self., then i started hunting where the self value is assigned..

[23:51] salva has left the channel
[23:52] mappum: ha, i see someone doing 8 byte numbers as an array of 2 4 byte numbers
[23:52] djcoin has joined the channel
[23:52] ashishg has joined the channel
[23:53] insin: uh, the first one doesn't use "this" at all, not much of an example for nicer usage of it :D
[23:53] insin: not that it needs to, either, for the particular thing it's doing
[23:54] _theriffer_ has left the channel
[23:54] ^robertj has joined the channel
[23:54] daniel`: insin: something simple and useful for things like log messages, debugging information, etc.
[23:54] saurb has joined the channel
[23:55] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[23:55] jamescarr has joined the channel
[23:55] insin: daniel`: did you know that the console.* methods do that?
[23:55] daniel`: basically some kind of sexier cousin of sprintf
[23:55] insin: %s for string interpolation, %j for json and, uh... another one I never use
[23:56] daniel`: insin: hmm, yes, but I may not want to log to stdout
[23:56] dunder-mifflin: insin: but that's the whole idea, right? if you need to use this, surely there's a way to break down the functions into smaller ones such that you don't have to rely on this/self 
[23:56] daniel`: %j is awesome, that’s the kind of thing I need
[23:56] knite has joined the channel
[23:56] insin: they use util.format under the hood, IIRC
[23:56] xaq has joined the channel
[23:56] dunder-mifflin: insin: e.g. create another object.. and refer to it using the object name.. it's easier to digest  something like message.doSomething() than this.doSomething()..
[23:56] daniel`: insin: ah! great, thanks!
[23:56] r04r has joined the channel
[23:56] bkaney has left the channel
[23:57] daniel`: %s, %d, and %j are the only ones
[23:57] daniel`: simple, elegant!
[23:57] insin: dunder-mifflin: agreed on the latter, I use that instead of self if the .bind()ing gets out of hand
[23:57] daniel`: though not sure what %d can do, maybe things like %02d?
[23:58] CoverSlide: nope
[23:58] CoverSlide: just %d
[23:58] isao: casts to int?
[23:58] paulwe has joined the channel
[23:58] dunder-mifflin: insin: then i know that it's a 'message', instead of worrying, what 'this' or 'self' it refers to... that saves me a brain cycle, and hence it's more readable.. everytime i see lots of "self." it makes me think "what now..."
[23:58] CoverSlide: but would be cool if it did
[23:59] CoverSlide: .. console.log("- %d -", new Date)
[23:59] catb0t:  Exception: ReferenceError: console is not defined
[23:59] CoverSlide: motherfucker
[23:59] CoverSlide: .. print("- %d -", new Date)
[23:59] catb0t:  "- %d -"{ Wed Feb 15 2012 18:59:41 GMT-0500 (EST) }
[23:59] CoverSlide: oh well
