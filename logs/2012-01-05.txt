[00:00] isaacs: mmalecki: yeah, this is a bug in node-tar
[00:00] markq: I'm reading a javascript book but I've gotten to a point where I just want to jump into the node.js docs/api and start coding
[00:00] isaacs: mmalecki: it's interpreting a link to . as a link to "", then later interpreting "" as having no link
[00:01] pyrotechnick: markq: perfect. go for it.

[00:02] markq: very nice javascript book
[00:02] CoverSlide: http://docs.nodejitsu.com/ <-- this is a good resource for node-specific articles

[00:04] pyrotechnick: and do code searches for particular methods to learn from other's usage

[00:20] shree_: pyrotechnick: I did try by myself and found node to be slower.

[00:52] pyrotechnick: but the mechanism is huge
[00:52] torvalamo: i was away from programming for a year, but js template makes no sense to me
[00:52] Sorella: tbranyen, "difference"?
[00:52] Sorella: void function(){ }(); for statements; var x = function(){ }(); for expressions =/
[00:52] context: pyrotechnick: i said js + simple. so +coffee+tmpl_lib isnt simple what so ever

[02:09] pyrotechnick: hey SubStack
[02:09] Cover|Away: which is every network
[02:09] Cover|Away: ok, gone
[02:09] pyrotechnick: SubStack: do you have an alert on "dnode" or something?
[02:09] blueadept: whatup substack, liked the node.js aesthetic post

[02:10] pyrotechnick: that's badass
[02:10] zitchdog has joined the channel
[02:10] SubStack: AMONG OTHER THINGS
[02:10] torvalamo: dnode dnode dnode
[02:11] SubStack: secoif: pretty much when you go the regular socket route you end up with a giant msg = JSON.parse(line); switch (msg.type) { ... }
[02:11] pyrotechnick: i think we should let him do it
[02:11] torvalamo: in the old days people had alerts on "boobs" and "tits", now it's "dnode" and other things
[02:11] pyrotechnick: you cannot see the light from outside of darkness
[02:11] SubStack: it's also a lot of bookkeeping to handle asynchronous request/responses
[02:12] pyrotechnick: it would also help him gain an appreciation for socket.io
[02:12] SubStack: doing stateful operations with a rest api causes that too

[02:15] secoif: SubStack can you give example on such bookkeeping
[02:15] pyrotechnick: in the future everyone will realise this but for now we're in the dark ages alone
[02:16] SubStack: secoif: imagine how you would design an api over a plain tcp socket for long-running jobs
[02:16] secoif: SubStack ahh, yeah. jobids. gross.
[02:17] joestein has joined the channel
[02:17] secoif: SubStack is that what you mean? one job that that requires multiple back and forward communication?
[02:18] TheIronWolf has joined the channel
[02:18] SubStack: any sort of stateful interaction like that
[02:18] SubStack: routing the messages is really painful
[02:18] secoif: And the alternative is? I don't see how socketio solves that one
[02:18] pyrotechnick: Marak: you are so incredibly insane
[02:18] SubStack: dnode solves the routing problem
[02:19] pyrotechnick: it's the kind of lack of sanity i adore though
[02:19] joestein has joined the channel
[02:19] SubStack: by making closures do all the work
[02:19] secoif: SubStack as in you can pass the state with the event
[02:19] secoif: ?
[02:19] Shaunzie has joined the channel
[02:20] jakehow has joined the channel
[02:20] SubStack: you don't pass anything and the only thing that travels over the wire is a callback id
[02:20] SubStack: you just write programs the usual way except you can call your methods remotely
[02:21] SubStack: including passing callbacks to remotely-hosted methods
[02:21] SubStack: and passing callbacks to the callbacks that were passed to you in your remotely hosted method
[02:21] SubStack: and so on, recursively
[02:22] torvalamo: yo dawg, i heard you like callbacks, so i put a callback in your callback so you can pass out while you debug
[02:22] teadict: stupid ORM doesn't wanna query a remote machine
[02:23] secoif: SubStack I think I'll need to give it a shot, I have this aversion, something about breaking encapsulation but perhaps I don't get it fully.

[02:24] jgallen23: from inside a module, is there any way to get the directory of the file that referenced it?
[02:24] jgallen23: I'm running the node file via upstart so process.cwd() is /, but I need /var/www/site/
[02:24] teadict: that violates the funk
[02:25] andrewfff has joined the channel
[02:25] torvalamo: the module can be referenced from many different places
[02:25] torvalamo: so it wouldn't make sense to have that information in one place..
[02:25] euoia has joined the channel
[02:26] sorensen: anyone know if you can do a pre('read') in mongoosejs?
[02:26] secoif: sorensen I don't believe so. Perhaps you want to use a getter or virtuals.
[02:26] sorensen: i'm trying to restrict read access on a schema level
[02:27] sorensen: so getter/setter wouldnt help me much
[02:27] sorensen: its the find() findById() methods i'm trying to restrict
[02:27] torvalamo: jgallen23: you can get the module's directory with __dirname, and if you know your app structure you can work from there?
[02:28] jgallen23: torvalamo: yeah, that's ugly, but it might be the only way to go.
[02:28] wookiehangover has joined the channel
[02:28] RLa: why not just use /var/www/site?
[02:28] sorensen: __dirname is a pretty girl
[02:28] torvalamo: yeah unless there's a way you can pass the information to the module
[02:28] sorensen: thankyouverymuch
[02:28] jgallen23: I might just pass in __dirname to the module
[02:28] RLa: either hard-coded or configurable
[02:29] torvalamo: /var/www/site is pretty hard coded i must say
[02:29] torvalamo: i have my stuff in /home
[02:29] torvalamo: but i'm weird
[02:29] RLa: i'm actually doing same
[02:30] torvalamo: also makes it easier to separate a running test server and a dev environment
[02:30] RLa: helps to make machine more organized and when you need to install another instance of software it would not be possible with system-wide install
[02:31] torvalamo: spot on
[02:32] torvalamo: actually i don't even specify home, i just say ~
[02:32] torvalamo: saves so much trouble :p
[02:32] jgallen23: so your sites are in your user's home folder?
[02:32] torvalamo: yeah
[02:32] nisc_ has joined the channel
[02:33] joshkehn has joined the channel
[02:33] torvalamo: easier to add/remove more instances etc

[02:33] joshkehn has left the channel
[02:33] torvalamo: i have a separate user for each instance
[02:33] torvalamo: since it has a copy of the app in each home dir

[05:35] benvie: example of the benefit of String.trim over String.prototype.trim
[05:35] torvalamo: hm

[05:36] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[05:36] benvie: anyway there's a lot of uses for it, in that it allows functional usages

[05:39] torvalamo: it's not an easy function to map to or anything
[05:39] benvie: that one specifically since it doesn't return anything
[05:40] benvie: functional usage generally takes in one thing and returns one thing
[05:40] benvie: but just using that quick shim to parameterize all the Array/String prototype functions is useful, and brings it into paraity with what exists in Chrome and Firefox
[05:40] stonebranch has joined the channel
[05:41] torvalamo: yeah i agree it should be consistent
[05:41] torvalamo: where possible
[05:41] benvie: er actually I don't see it in Chrome

[05:43] benvie: works in FF anyway and it should be standard because it's useful
[05:43] torvalamo: i love the prototype version, but i can't think of a use for the static one
[05:44] torvalamo: but i'm sure someone could come up with something
[05:44] torvalamo: i'm calling it static but there's probably a better name for it
[05:44] innoying has joined the channel
[05:44] benvie: yeah there isn't any since forEach returns nothing and also has no side effects
[05:45] benvie: but most of the rest of the string and array prototype  functions do return something
[05:45] benvie: maybe all of them except forEach
[05:45] xSmurf has joined the channel
[05:45] torvalamo: unshift, and push don't
[05:45] torvalamo: do they?
[05:45] benvie: i would call them prototypal functions
[05:46] benvie: yeah they operate on `this` which would be paramterzied as
[05:46] benvie: Array.push(myArray, "some item")
[05:46] torvalamo: never mind they return the new array length
[05:46] benvie: and yeah that
[05:46] SomeoneWeird: is require() the same as php's include() ?
[05:46] benvie: also there is the use of composing those functions
[05:47] torvalamo: forEach can also operate on this
[05:47] benvie: yeah
[05:47] torvalamo: since this is passed as the third param in the callback
[05:47] torvalamo: as well as each element obviously
[05:47] benvie: Array.forEach(someArray, myCallback, thisBinding)
[05:47] torvalamo: callback(element, index, array)
[05:48] torvalamo: or element, index, someArray
[05:48] benvie: logForEach = Array.forEach.bind(null, someArray, function(s){console.log(s)})
[05:49] benvie: will then always console.log everything in someArray
[05:49] torvalamo: that's rape
[05:49] benvie: so there's always uses
[05:49] torvalamo: maybe the standard is trying to prevent broken code

[06:42] tprice: im using the runInThisContext and i want to require from the "path" of the context that im running
[06:42] tprice: ryah: how would i add to NODE_PATH?
[06:43] ryah: export NODE_PATH=$HOME/local/my_module_repo
[06:44] tprice: looking at the node.js src file and NativeModule.require i dont see how it gets the path
[06:44] tprice: ryah: that has to be done outside of node?
[06:44] secoif: tprice, you could also wrap require in your own definition that prepends the 'path of your context' 
[06:44] ryah: tprice: yes
[06:44] ryah: tprice: we don't like letting people modify their module path
[06:44] ryah: tprice: we prefer people to keep modules local
[06:44] AAA_awright: In a sane world, the understanding is by forming a derivative work, you're using the project's existing license. But if you need an explicit statement:
[06:44] AAA_awright: http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blob;f=Documentation/SubmittingPatches;h=4468ce24427cb011e7991d8f1ae2560764b170b8;hb=HEAD#l297 That should be all one needs. There's nothing in there that would change just because you use a liberal license (or public domain, as I do... Oh dear SQLite uses Fossil, kill me now)
[06:44] ryah: in a node_modules folder
[06:45] benvie: you need to look into lib/module.js and extend Module to have a dynamic include path for that
[06:45] secoif: tprice as in, redefine require in the context you supply to runInThisContext
[06:45] benvie: if you're looking to change it using vm
[06:45] tprice: secoif: yes
[06:45] secoif: should be simple enough.
[06:45] tprice: im making an app server with custom contexts for each app
[06:45] benvie: https://github.com/Benvie/Context-Loader has some work related to that but doesn't explicitly work with node's module system

[06:46] benvie: The idea of loading a module in a specific V8 context that aren't completely seperate node instances has a lot of use and merit

[06:48] secoif: tprice you can pass data to the new process you fire up
[06:48] r3dbr1ck has left the channel

[06:55] voidvector: What is preferred in node.js, the 'new' keyword? or Object.create?
[06:55] benvie: they're different
[06:55] benvie: Object.create creates an object with its __proto__ set to the passed in object
[06:55] SubStack: write unit tests
[06:55] tprice: so i can call something like var module = new Module.constructor(id, parent);?
[06:55] SubStack: then nobody cares
[06:56] benvie: but doesn't run the constructor on the result
[06:56] _jzl has joined the channel
[06:56] tuhoojabotti has joined the channel
[06:56] benvie: require('module') gets you node's Module
[06:56] benvie: but otherwise yeah
[06:56] SubStack: and if you're writing a module for public consumption then just use regular functions
[06:57] benvie: also you can't use the `new` keyword like that
[06:57] benvie: you'd need to do  var module = new (Module.constructor(id, parent));
[06:58] benvie: you'd need to do  `var module = new (require('module').constructor(id, parent));` to put it together
[06:58] ph^ has joined the channel
[06:59] ccare has joined the channel
[06:59] tprice: or var module = new (require('module').constructor)(id, parent); is it not all the same?
[07:00] tprice: but i think im just going to replace the module.js with my own
[07:00] benvie: it just needs to be wrapped in parenthesis if you're using the new keyword
[07:00] benvie: so it operates on the result
[07:00] benvie: or you can do this
[07:02] benvie: function construct(ctor){ return new (ctor.bind.apply(ctor, Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1))); }
[07:02] meso has joined the channel
[07:03] benvie: then you'd do construct(Module, a, b, c)

[07:23] catb0t:  true
[07:24] chrisdickinson: okay, yeah. makes sense. was unaware that Function#bind worked with `new` so nicely.
[07:24] benvie: it didn't until ES5
[07:25] benvie: but it was added since there's no other way to construct an object with variable arguments using `new`
[07:25] benvie: without eval or something stupid like new ctor(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k)
[07:25] chrisdickinson: yeah
[07:25] chrisdickinson: i always forget about that particular wart.
[07:26] chrisdickinson: which is to say, it only pops up once every three to six months :\
[07:26] benvie: so a bound function, when using `new` is set to the newly constructed object
[07:26] benvie: the thing that Object.create(ctor.prototype) would give
[07:27] benvie: instead of like new Function.prototype which is useless
[07:27] chrisdickinson: yeah, i remember looking the discussion around bind in es5shim re: being able to work nicely with new, but for it was during one of those off months where i wasn't trying to curry a function instantiation
[07:28] benvie: it's not possible to emulate that specific bit of functionality so yeah that's one of those key disconnects with shims
[07:28] benvie: stuff involving changes to keyword functionality are few and far between with Es5

[08:37] secoif: _Tristan few tips, path module is your friend. You don't need to do all that .split stuff if you use path.basename, path.extname, etc
[08:38] secoif: _Tristan http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.6.6/api/all.html#path
[08:38] _Tristan: secoif: thank you
[08:38] secoif: _Tristan it's also got path.exists
[08:39] DTrejo: path.join also
[08:39] secoif: secondly. you could probably just use express' static file server
[08:39] DTrejo: it's good to get an idea of what's going on underneath
[08:39] DTrejo: just for edification
[08:39] secoif: DTrejo that's true.
[08:40] secoif: _Tristan many people also use nginx for static file serving
[08:40] _Tristan: I use nginx for static file serving, I'm just trying to learn stuff
[08:40] secoif: awesome.
[08:41] secoif: yeah I don't play with streams or pipes enough to help you unfortunately

[08:43] secoif: _Tristan I think the issue is that your pipe command is async, but you end the res before it's got a chance to complete
[08:43] DTrejo: _Tristan: summary: comment out res.end() because pipe does that for you

[08:44] secoif: agree.
[08:44] davetayls has joined the channel
[08:45] DTrejo: the soft tabs advice is just to be doing the same thing at many people do in the node community, and the early returns and avoiding indentation is just for all programming
[08:45] _Tristan: I hate soft tabs, they're never soft enough
[08:45] Nuck: DTrejo: I prefer hard tabs simply because it's good when you've got 5 guys of different tab-width-preference ;)
[08:45] kmurph79 has joined the channel
[08:45] DTrejo: ^ _Tristan, yeah up to :) but also this article is great: stella.laurenzo.org/2011/03/bulletproof-node-js-coding/ I highly recommend you read it and especially try the named functions advice
[08:45] secoif: _Tristan deep down, I think tabs are better, but I've succumbed to the two space thing 
[08:45] DTrejo: Nuck: yeah, it's a religious thing
[08:46] Nuck: DTrejo: Very much so
[08:46] davetayls has joined the channel
[08:46] Nuck: DTrejo: I think 8-wide tabs are also religious
[08:46] DTrejo: I kinda just like 2 spaces b/c that is what a lot of people use for node & JS
[08:46] secoif: Nuck that's the browser's fauly
[08:46] secoif: fault*
[08:46] rgl has joined the channel
[08:46] Nuck: Because, at the very least, it's ridiculous
[08:46] Nuck: secoif: Hrm?  No, I mean in vim, etc.
[08:47] Nuck: All the command line editors use 8-wide tabs as default, I hear Linus Torvalds does as well
[08:47] secoif: oh yeah, i'm talking about in gists.
[08:47] Nuck: Something about "preventing nesting" or some shit
[08:47] Nuck: IDFK
[08:47] secoif: Nuck I used 8 space tabs for years, uni taught us to do it.
[08:47] Nuck: secoif: haha
[08:47] DTrejo: Nuck: it prevents nesting b/c 80 line columns prevent you from nesting to stupid dumbass levels ;)
[08:47] Nuck: I've always been a 4-wide guy, until recently
[08:47] Nuck: Now I'm 3-wide
[08:48] DTrejo: !
[08:48] bergie has joined the channel
[08:48] DTrejo: how odd!
[08:48] secoif: oh get out
[08:48] DTrejo: lol
[08:48] secoif: Nuck 3?
[08:48] secoif: really
[08:48] Nuck: I blame Node for making me lower my indentations :P
[08:48] Nuck: So many callbacks that 4-wide was getting unwieldy.  And I cannot read 2-wide indented code
[08:48] secoif: i have genuinely seen code indented to multiples of 3 before
[08:48] DTrejo: next thing you know you'll be soft tabbing with just anyone you meet on the street
[08:48] Nuck: It just doesn't look normal
[08:48] DTrejo: Nuck ^
[08:49] secoif: hahaha
[08:49] Nuck: However, I use hard-tabs, so the switch was as easy as changing the setting in my .sublime_settings file
[08:49] Nuck: Though I had some issues with alignment, I moved that all to spaces
[08:49] DTrejo: Nuck: I highly recommend named callbacks from the stella article, if you haven't already read it. works great at preventing callback indentation death
[08:49] secoif: The thing i like about tabs is that you can configure your ide to whatever you wish
[08:49] DTrejo: stella.laurenzo.org/2011/03/bulletproof-node-js-coding/
[08:50] insin: reStructuredText uses 3 by recommendation :)
[08:50] secoif: mention tabs vs spaces = derail conversation immediately.
[08:50] insin: lines up with its directives
[08:51] DTrejo: guys, I like my open braces like this: if (condition) {
[08:51] Nuck: secoif: Yep
[08:51] DTrejo: let's talk about brace placement now
[08:51] Nuck: DTrejo: Anything else is just dirty.
[08:51] secoif: that bulletproof coding post would be more potent if the site design wasn't so ghastly
[08:51] DTrejo: ;)
[08:51] Nuck: ;)
[08:51] secoif: ;)
[08:52] DTrejo: night night everyone
[08:52] DTrejo: sleep well

[17:02] blueadept: currently working with a rails team, had to do something real quick so i just wipped up node.js, installed some email modules, web modules, and got a tiny little up in no time. something that if i had done in rails may have taken me a few days
[17:02] wereHamster: blueadept: I can't find it right now, but there is a site which displays the nodejs watchers and rails watchers on github. Nodejs has taken over sometime late last year

[17:03] negrete: hello everyone, one question: is it possible to know what port an app is trying to open before actually running the app?
[17:03] martin_sunset: That's mmalecki s site
[17:03] bradleymeck: negrete ? trying to open
[17:03] blueadept: wereHamster: yeah i caught that
[17:03] wereHamster: ah, here: http://nodejs-vs-ror.nodejitsu.com/
[17:03] blueadept: yep
[17:03] blueadept: the jitsu team
[17:04] wereHamster: blueadept: I don't think nodejs is necessarily faster than rails when building new apps.

[17:04] bradleymeck: negrete you can intercept the listen with something like haibu-carapace does but you can't know prior to running unless you explicitly code in a way that it is in a config or something

[17:07] negrete: bradleymeck: thank you! I wasn't aware of carapace, I'll give it a try, and yes, I'd like to know which port an app tries to listen at before actually running it
[17:07] bLiNdRaGe: quick question, what's immeidately wrong with this? app.get('/blog/page',function(req,res) {  res.redirect('/blog/page/1');  });
[17:08] bLiNdRaGe: it's not directing to page/1
[17:08] djazz has joined the channel
[17:08] bradleymeck: negrete, you cannot before actually running if it is not specified in a config :-/ if it is just any program someone wrote you have to run it to see
[17:09] deedubs: bLiNdRaGe: do you have something farther up the routes stack that is catching it?
[17:09] slajax has joined the channel
[17:10] bLiNdRaGe: not sure what exactly is going on. if i go to /blog/page ,  i get an error from my .jade file that something is undefined (as though it hit my app.get('/blog/page/:pagenum',function(req,res) {  without actually having req.params.pagenum )
[17:10] bLiNdRaGe: /blog/page sends to /blog/page/1 which renders the jade with some stuff going on
[17:10] djazz has joined the channel
[17:10] herbySk has joined the channel
[17:11] bLiNdRaGe: it's hitting the jade, so it looks like it is hitting the /blog/page/:pagenum with an undefined pagenum
[17:11] bLiNdRaGe: let me see if i can do a null check
[17:11] negrete: @bradleymeck, I was hoping there was a callback or something like that before actually opening the port :(

[17:12] bLiNdRaGe: let me do some more checks
[17:12] bradleymeck: negrete nope, you have to monkey punch it (like carapace does) and from there you could stall for a bit, but it must be sync so no callback, in our case we emit an event and work with it there

[19:09] davidwalsh has joined the channel
[19:10] jarek__ has joined the channel
[19:10] slickplaid: bnoordhuis: I'd be caching a json object response of the function. So if the input hasn't changed, just use the previous result of the input instead of running through the computationally expensive function to crunch the numbers again.
[19:10] EhevuTov: tjfontaine, for both, actually. It will not only be using filters (to block certain protocols, addresses) but also to log for querying
[19:11] tjfontaine: EhevuTov: but does the decision making need to be realtime as the call is coming in or would it suffice expostfacto?
[19:11] EhevuTov: I "heard" node.js programs sometimes die (I guess it's is/was a V8 issue?)
[19:11] martin_sunset: EhevuTov: Forever is a lib that keeps it alive. The unteresting part about hook.io is that it is a distributed event processor, modeled a bit after akka and erlang. It is exactly what you need
[19:11] bradleymeck has joined the channel
[19:12] EhevuTov: tjfontaine, it needs to be realtime. It will be fanned out to other node.js nodes, probably with something like zeromq
[19:12] GrizzLyCRO1 has joined the channel
[19:12] EhevuTov: martin_sunset, oh that sounds interesting. Now, to keep it alive, do you mean it revives it if it dies, or does it do something to always allow the stream socket to be open and readable?
[19:12] barberdt has joined the channel
[19:14] EhevuTov: I guess the only thing I can think of and have experience with is 'cluster', which connects to a socket and distributes to the node cluster and revives a node if it dies. But, I'm worried about the actual cluster dying
[19:14] martin_sunset: EhevuTov: It revives. There is a lot of docs online, you might want to look into it.
[19:15] wingie: what would case a node.js server to die? error?
[19:15] jergason has joined the channel
[19:15] slickplaid: throw an error
[19:15] martin_sunset: Or turn the machine off
[19:15] CoverSlide: yeah uncaught errors will kill a process

[19:16] EhevuTov: wingie, it's just hearsay but I heard it was an issue with V8
[19:16] tjfontaine: everything dies
[19:16] EhevuTov: lol
[19:16] martin_sunset: Wingie not all errors are bugs, sometimes it's bad data

[20:20] markq: how
[20:21] andrew12: well you aren't doing make clean every time right?
[20:21] markq: I was thinking of running 2 parallel jobs but i forgot that option before running make
[20:21] andrew12: it only should recompile the changed parts
[20:21] markq: I'm not oing make clean
[20:21] markq: just ./configure && make && make install
[20:21] KBM has joined the channel
[20:21] andrew12: you should just be able to do make && make install again.
[20:21] andrew12: ./configure actually cleans everything iirc
[20:22] andrew12: so unless something to do with ./configure changed you should be fine.
[20:22] markq: wait so ./configure = make clean?
[20:22] markq: oh ok
[20:22] markq: yea I didn't change anything
[20:22] andrew12: i'm talking about code changes
[20:22] markq: so technically this compile should be shorter than te last
[20:22] andrew12: i've never actually had to compile node myself, so i'm not sure if that'll even help
[20:22] andrew12: yeah
[20:23] markq: and are we still checking out v0.6.6?
[20:23] sarlalian: andrew12: even if ./configure doesn't, most programs have a make distclean or a make clean option too

[20:57] mgolawala: the dark side of open source  --  Project user: "Could you port your project to 3.x?"  Project owner: "I'm busy. If you need it, send me a pull request or a patch."
[20:58] mgolawala: I suppose thats more like the dark lining in the silver cloud
[20:59] stride: mgolawala: "we discontinued this project 2 years ago, so.. no" with opensource you at least have the chance to see what they did two years ago :)
[20:59] moogoo: believe it or not...some developers have better things to do

[21:01] mmalecki: SubStack: good for you
[21:01] torvalamo: problem is with python (and sometimes node) modules, it sometimes contains C, which I am not good at
[21:01] SubStack: I'm still on 0.4 too
[21:01] torvalamo: at all
[21:01] mmalecki: SubStack: that totally explains it
[21:02] gmcerveny: So I made my first node thing: https://github.com/gmcerveny/jsonbin
[21:02] Dulak: torvalamo: on the python side just go to pypy and do everything in python, it's almost as fast as the C, but it's python.  And it just keeps getting faster with every release.
[21:02] gmcerveny: Now I want to serve some static files, it seems that fs.readfile() is not the right way
[21:03] SubStack: the awesome thing about how npm versions and node_modules work is that once something works you don't have to fuck with it as the rest of the system evolves
[21:03] gmcerveny: oop brb
[21:03] SubStack: incrementalism!
[21:03] torvalamo: Dulak: i don't use python anymore though, it was just an example
[21:03] torvalamo: from previous experience
[21:04] torvalamo: doesn't fix the node modules with C problems
[21:05] mgolawala: Dulak : Not a bad thing. I'm just mentioning the flip side of OSS. One the one hand, having access to the source if you need it is awesome. On the other hand, if you need something changed, you have no leverage (i.e. you aren't paying for it so you can't call someone up) to have something fixed/updated in a timely manner, so you may have to do it yourself. Time = money. Specifically, In those cases you are just trading one for the other. 
[21:05] moogoo: I miss the days of frustration trying to get php4 and php5 to live together in peace
[21:05] torvalamo: oh php
[21:05] torvalamo: now that's even longer since i touched
[21:05] mgolawala: Having a disadvantage does not make something a bad thing. You have to look at the advantages too. :)
[21:06] moogoo: lucky u torvalamo 
[21:06] SubStack: mgolawala: you can always do a bounty for a feature
[21:06] Dulak: mgolawala: But expecting free work, and saying the fact that you can't get free work is a bad thing is a misnomer.  You can always pay a dev (like me) to do the changes you need to the code.  With proprietary you could not do that, because the source is closed.
[21:06] torvalamo: i applied for a php job once, the interviewers were robots... and quite thick
[21:07] torvalamo: well, either thick or full of themselves
[21:07] torvalamo: hubris would be the worrd
[21:07] moogoo: I try to avoid giving anti PHP rants during srs job interviews
[21:07] mgolawala: I do see a lot of PHP devs get all defensive about their language
[21:07] torvalamo: "php can do anything"

[21:09] mgolawala: Like Javascript. 
[21:09] mgolawala: You accept that some things are hideous..
[21:09] torvalamo: moogoo: impressive or pointless?
[21:09] slickplaid: javascript has no flaws! wait...nm
[21:09] mgolawala: but focus on the prettier pieces
[21:09] moogoo: pointless is a virtue in programming
[21:09] torvalamo: then php is a virtue
[21:10] torvalamo: your logic is flawed
[21:10] moogoo: php isn't pointless
[21:10] mgolawala: VB is pointless

[21:11] Dulak: It's only the young and inexperienced that will bicker about languages.  Older experienced devs just work around whatever warts they encounter and deliver code, while the others are busy arguing in blog comments, your senior dev is delivering a product.
[21:11] mgolawala: heh. It's like the flawed languages are the ones that end up becoming most popular. C++, Javascript, PHP
[21:11] xeodox: In Express, when I do app.delete()…how do I get the body data? req.body doesn't work.
[21:11] moogoo: js only became popular cause it had a monopolly on the browser
[21:11] torvalamo: without exaggeration, php is a thrash can of programming conventions, most of which have been shredded before they got there

[21:16] moogoo: node.js is an I/O framework using js
[21:16] AAA_awright: masclic: It's more like... Well, asynchronous I/O
[21:16] mgolawala: right now its complimentary, but in the future it could be a replacement

[21:16] devongovett has joined the channel
[21:16] masclic: mm i see
[21:17] markq: i don't really understand how node.js introduced callbacks into javascript
[21:17] Dulak: The reason php got so popular so fast was it was the first real opensource server-side language aimed at making webpages easy to manipulate.  It was the perfect time, because there was virtually no competition from the 'better' languages in that space.  It was the only choice that wasn't a complete mess.  (perl cgi was pretty nasty back then)
[21:17] bradleymeck: mgolawala, you can use it as a replacement but not for the general prebuilt module stuff you ssee with most of those
[21:17] cyborg: masclic well there are plenty using solely node in production
[21:17] bradleymeck: markq it didn't
[21:17] torvalamo: markq it didn't introduce it, it just embraced it
[21:17] torvalamo: to the nth degree
[21:17] markq: what do you mean
[21:18] mgolawala: bradleymeck: Agreed. It's doable, just not as mature a platform. I think it is headed there. 
[21:18] masclic: but for make money with developer sites now the better is php right? for wordpress, drupal and magento sites in the world?
[21:19] masclic: wordpress have 50% all cms sites in the world
[21:19] bradleymeck: mgolawala, depends on needs. but at the rate it is going all it really lacks is some nice tooling. Frameworks have started to take over enough with flatiron and express
[21:19] mgolawala: bradleymeck: Ie. the other languages he mentioned have mature frameworks with massive libraries, and established patterns and such. Node has a couple of good frameworks, but I wouldn't call them mature just yet
[21:19] Dulak: masclic: if you are doing freelance stuff piecemeal, you're gonna need to know php.  If you are going to be doing project work, then you might get away not knowing php.
[21:19] markq: i wonder if facebook is still running on nginx or if they partly use node now
[21:19] torvalamo: markq: what i mean is that node is asynchronous, so it NEEDS callbacks
[21:19] bradleymeck: markq there was an effort to move a decent bit to node but idk where that ended
[21:19] tjholowaychuk: mgolawala just because they dont do all the coding for you doesn't mean they're not mature(ish)

[21:31] martin_sunset: Dulak most people can't express what they need. More often than not they need someone who can adapt a template and do some jQuery stuff
[21:32] tjholowaychuk: illumina whatever you want

[21:32] illumina: just about to get to 3 "controllers"
[21:32] torvalamo: doesn't depend on anything, it can still be whatever you want :P

[21:34] SubStack: illumina: you can take a service-oriented approach to building a game
[21:34] mgolawala: The thing that irks me is that any decent programmer I have ever spoken to agrees "language is irrelevant, any good programmer can learn a new language in a few weeks and figure out the gremlins in a few months". Yet every job posting I see seems to be "PHP developer" , "Java expert" , "Ruby ninja", "Python Guru"

[21:36] blueadept: i'm open to soemthing better in node
[21:36] SubStack: because you can test and refactor the pieces in isolation

[21:47] SubStack: also metrics collection based on the deployment id/git commit hash would be super boss
[21:47] gmcerveny has joined the channel
[21:47] EyePulp: tjholowaychuk: I want to upgrade from 0.4.x to a more current node, but wanted to plan my route from your cluster (unless it's been made compatible now)
[21:47] CoverSlide: that's the best way to learn something, just say something really outlandishly wrong and have people correct you
[21:47] gmcerveny: what is the preferred method to serve static files from node.js?
[21:48] tjholowaychuk: EyePulp nope it doesn't work for 0.6.x yet sorry
[21:48] tjholowaychuk: forever is more like monit though, so you'll likely want to use node's core cluster to spin up a few processes
[21:48] tjholowaychuk: then use forever to monitor them or something
[21:48] lmatteis: wouldn't be awesome if there was a node hosting provider that could host your app for free and all it needed to deploy your node app to yourapp.somesite.com was the url to the github project?
[21:48] EyePulp: tjholowaychuk: no worries - I'm sure you get bugged enough about various projects.

[21:49] SubStack: pquerna: I really want a continuous deployment system that is geared towards performing experiments keyed to git hashes
[21:49] blueadept: or to california at least
[21:49] tjholowaychuk: gmcerveny connect.static() is probably the most feature-rich one around for now
[21:49] tjholowaychuk: blueadept meh
[21:49] tjholowaychuk: i dont like the US

[21:50] SubStack: tjholowaychuk: move to bellingham!

[21:50] SubStack: it's pretty much exactly like BC but slightly further south
[21:50] gmcerveny: tjholowaychuk: i'm trying to stay just in the node.js core right now, make sure I understand the platform
[21:50] pquerna: SubStack: ah, hrm. yeah, that would be cool, like directing specific users to a different webapp server running different rev?
[21:50] tjholowaychuk: gmcerveny not a bad idea

[22:37] mikeric has joined the channel
[22:37] markq: i have no idea why people are using ec2 since it seems to have a lot of problems compared to racksapce
[22:37] markq: rackspace*
[22:38] Romasato: for CDN?
[22:38] blueadept: they both have their + or - depending on your case
[22:38] SubStack: my startup moved off of ec2 due to lockups that would last for a minute or more
[22:38] blueadept: like if you're rolling your own object data store, maybe go with rackspace, otherwise use AWS object cloud
[22:38] SubStack: lousy ebs probably
[22:38] bradleymeck: rackspace aint perfect neither is ec2, joyent is actually amazing but more expensive
[22:38] DennisRasmussen has joined the channel
[22:38] andrew12: Romasato: I doubt they're talking about CDN, because you wouldn't use EC2 for CDN
[22:38] SubStack: that was just the windows instances though, the linux has been ok
[22:38] markq: what are the fundamental differeces between ec2 and racksapce#?
[22:39] markq: I'm curious
[22:39] andrew12: what's the rackspace equivalent of ec2?
[22:39] blueadept: linode maybe?

[22:42] Romasato: can't find anything helpful online
[22:42] Romasato: is it the same as waf for python?
[22:42] markq: general rule of thumb. stick with unix when using node
[22:42] markq: at least for production
[22:43] chjj: its a shame node isnt supported on cygwin anymore
[22:43] Romasato: markq, big difference from windows binary?
[22:43] donspaulding has joined the channel
[22:43] bradleymeck: chjj, cygwin is buggy if you use some fancy syscalls, it makes maintaining stuff really uggly
[22:43] Romasato: unix is not an option for me in any case atm
[22:43] insin: yeah, can't use 0.6 properly on windows at work now - can't compile deps which need it
[22:43] chjj: bradleymeck: i think im the only one on earth who doesnt hate cygwin
[22:43] markq: case in point: node is less of a headache on linux or unix
[22:44] insin: on the plus side, I'm getting more of my actual work done...
[22:44] bradleymeck: chjj, i love cygwin for scripting, not for running large apps
[22:44] bradleymeck: cause f powershel
[22:44] bradleymeck: Romasato only huge difference is C++ addons
[22:44] Romasato: just tried compiling nodejs under cygwin - broke on eio.o 
[22:44] torvalamo: if you use any syscalls that pretty OS dependent, doesn't matter if it's cygwin or what
[22:45] donspaulding: Tried to install node straight from github on Ubuntu 11.10.  Instead of using sudo, just ran "./configure --prefix=~/Apps/nodejs", configure went great, make && make install worked fine, repl comes up, but can't use npm because apparently node-waf isn't installed?
[22:45] level09 has joined the channel
[22:45] bradleymeck: torvalamo, correct but C++ addons will and do use syscalls :-/
