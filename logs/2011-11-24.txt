[00:02] volts: i cant figure out how to close a connection for a simple http server written in node
[00:02] davidban_: volts: The etiquette here is just to go ahead and ask. If someone knows the answer, they'll respond. If no-one does, then no-one will. So shoot!
[00:02] davidban_: Oh, timing.
[00:03] elevenarms has joined the channel
[00:03] volts: thnx davidban
[00:03] davidban_: volts: I'm guessing you're after res.end ? Post your code in a gist and it might be clearer.
[00:03] volts: right after res.end() i would like to close the connection from the server side
[00:04] volts: closest i have gotten is to include 'Connection': 'close' in the http header responce

[00:04] davidban_: So you specifically don't want to allow keep-alive? Would forcing it back to http1.0 instead of http 1.1 do it?
[00:05] volts: yeah i dont want any keep alive at all
[00:05] volts: ive also tried just removing keep alive from the header, no luck there
[00:06] diogogmt|2 has joined the channel
[00:06] volts: i can try forcing http1.0
[00:06] elevenarms has joined the channel
[00:06] volts: ty for the sugguestion, ill try that now
[00:06] davidbanham: No worries. Having a look at the docs I'm not actually sure there's a way to do it.
[00:06] thepatr1ck: you could try req.connection.end() (sends a FIN packet) or req.connection.destroy(), though those might not do what I'm expecting them to
[00:07] volts: ty thepatr1ck, ill try that too.  Do i have to add anything to get connection to be defined ?
[00:07] thepatr1ck: req.connection should just be there according to the docs
[00:08] davidbanham: Yeah looks like it goes directly to the socket. - http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.6.2/api/http.html#request.connection
[00:09] volts: thanks alot, ill try the 2 things suggested and get back to you guys.

[01:10] vkandy: guys, i have a multiple machines running express on nodejs .. a load balancer routes traffic to all nodes. now i have some scheduled operations for which i am using scheduler on all nodes. 
[01:10] vkandy: but i'd like them to "communicate" with each other so that only a SINGLE node in the cluster performs certain scheduled operations. -- like a distributed mutex sort f thing
[01:11] vkandy: i thought i'd use multicasting but looks like it's not completely implemented in 0.6.2 ... can anyone suggest other ideas?

[01:22] perezd: thats a thing
[01:22] perezd: what OSes are people deploying into production for node?
[01:22] Lingerance: Linux.
[01:22] perezd: Lingerance: what led you to that
[01:22] perezd: did you consider solaris or others
[01:22] a_meteorite: perezd: all Linux here
[01:22] Lingerance: Solaris is dying.
[01:22] bLiNdRaGe: or if anyone knows a better library for md5 in node.js
[01:22] Lingerance: BSD was a pain last time I had to deal with it.
[01:22] perezd: was curious in terms of performance which OS might have the best kernel setup for node's characteristics 
[01:22] a_meteorite: Linux interoperates well, and provides the best performance I imagine
[01:22] a_meteorite: It was a natural choice for us.
[01:22] a_meteorite: Though I have considered trying FreeBSD.
[01:23] vkandy: Aria: i think that makes sense.  i'll just use static ips and ports .. thanks
[01:23] Aria: SmartOS, Linux, MacOS and FreeBSD are all common
[01:24] Aria: And Windows. Windows, Linux and SmartOS are probably the best tuned, though they're all pretty good.
[01:24] Aria: bLiNdRaGe: That fails because it's looking for libev directly which is now private. IT needs to be ported to libuv.
[01:25] vkandy: why is solaris dying? 10 was just released
[01:25] vkandy: or was it 11??
[01:25] Aria: bLiNdRaGe: However, the built-in md5 should do fine for you.
[01:25] Aria: 11.
[01:25] Aria: Oracle's doing their best to kill it like they do everything, but with the open Solaris codebase out there, Illumos and now SmartOS are making some waves.
[01:25] bLiNdRaGe: what's the built in? can i call it as md5() ?
[01:25] Aria: bLiNdRaGe: require('crypto')
[01:26] bLiNdRaGe: google's not turning up anything on node.js + md5 other than hashlib
[01:26] perezd: I was looking into smartos
[01:26] perezd: not sure if I can run that on EC2
[01:26] bLiNdRaGe: ahhhh mustve missed that one
[01:26] bLiNdRaGe: thanks aria
[01:26] Lingerance: vkandy - OpenSolaris is gone, I see no future in a UNIX that has no ability for people to just pick up the free version and try it out.
[01:27] konobi: perezd: nah... it's not really possible to run any of the opensolaris based distros on EC2

[01:27] perezd: including smartos?
[01:28] konobi: yup... it's based on a much newer version
[01:28] perezd: konobi: if I am running a nodejs production application, would you recommend looking more closely at BSD or Linux 
[01:28] konobi: although i did hear someone saying that OI was possible... look for bdha's blog

[01:30] konobi: perezd: 2 secs
[01:31] perezd: yeah, it seems really helpful
[01:31] konobi: perezd: there's also the dtrace book, which is great
[01:31] perezd: yeah, I need a bridge to nodejs 
[01:31] perezd: so I understand how to apply it to that case
[01:31] vkandy: this is the first time i hear about smartos .. i am reading http://smartos.org/ but is it a UNIX?

[02:55] jocafa has joined the channel
[02:56] llrcombs: well, where can I find the code, and how can I put the modded version in a module?
[02:56] Aria: IT's in node's source tree -- look in src/
[02:57] Aria: And in a module is likely a bit harder, you'd have to clone a lot. I'd suggest contributing the support upstream.
[02:57] Aria: (Why are you using a custom HTTP verb?)

[02:58] seebees: anyone build from master recently?
[02:58] yebyen: does anyone build node.js on Debian GNU/FreeBSD?
[02:58] llrcombs: Siri's guzzoni protocol uses a custom HTTPS verb called ACE
[02:58] yebyen: should be almost the same except uname is GNU/FreeBSD which usually trips up most toolchains

[03:01] llrcombs: konobi: server
[03:01] Aria: llrcombs: Oh, fun. But I bet that's uncontroversial enough to just accept a patch to node. But that's my guess.
[03:01] mikeal has joined the channel
[03:01] llrcombs: Aria: so what, should I file a bug report on github and ask for nonstandard request methods to be treated like POST?
[03:02] Aria: Looks like the weird-ass content-length handling is going to be bizarre though
[03:02] Aria: No, you should ask for ACE specifically.
[03:02] Aria: POST is not a sane default.
[03:02] llrcombs: does it even send a content-length header?
[03:02] Aria: According to http://geeknizer.com/siri-protocol-cracked-explained/, it's not POST-like, particularly.
[03:02] Aria: And it sends Content-Length: 2000000000
[03:03] llrcombs: which I think is safe to just ignore
[03:03] Aria: yeah. But you're starting to get into "this isn't HTTP" territory.
[03:03] llrcombs: I just figured I'd treat it like POST because it's closer to that than any of the other methods
[03:03] Aria: Yeah, it's different though. IT has its own quirks.
[03:04] llrcombs: what's really the difference between this and chunked POST?
[03:04] Aria: No chunks?
[03:04] konobi: llrcombs: you're using http server directly?
[03:04] Aria: The broken content-length?
[03:04] Aria: https://github.com/substack/node-parsley might be useful to you.
[03:04] towski has joined the channel
[03:04] llrcombs: Aria: it keeps sending additional data on the same connection
[03:05] jldbasa has joined the channel
[03:05] Aria: And I might be wrong in that node's parser doesn't take unknown methods. Interesting.
[03:05] llrcombs: the content-length is probably there because it wants everything to continue working until the client closes the connection
[03:05] konobi: it will say it's unknown... but it still has it available... as to what happens once it hits the js part, i'm unsure
[03:05] Aria: Yeah. So they're basically making a tunnel protocol over HTTP.
[03:05] llrcombs: (the same connection is used until Siri is closed, and raw audio is transmitted)
[03:05] RyanW: I have a npm module named 'foo', in my package.json I have 'main' set to : lib/foo. If I use the module I can require('foo') to get what I set as 'main', but I can't use require('foo/bar') to get at 'lib/foo/bar'. What do I need to add to package.json to make that work?
[03:06] Aria: Interesting tactic. I think I'd use the raw TCP socket in node, and then use parsley.
[03:06] Aria: RAther than Node's HTTP parser.
[03:06] llrcombs: HTTPS, that is
[03:06] Aria: HTTPS is just HTTP with TLS ;-)
[03:06] Aria: Same parser.
[03:06] konobi: llrcombs: you're using require('hhtp') not something like express or connect, right?
[03:06] llrcombs: yeah, but still...
[03:06] llrcombs: konobi: right
[03:07] davidedwardclark has joined the channel
[03:07] llrcombs: and the http builtin parser ignores nonstandard methods

[03:11] towski has joined the channel
[03:12] llrcombs: hmm
[03:13] llrcombs: I don't see anything there that should be chucking out unknown methods...
[03:13] konobi: llrcombs: i'd suggest asking for a patch that has something like '_orig_method' that is available when it's an "unknown_method_sym" so you can still access it
[03:13] llrcombs: but I'm definitely getting connection events, but not request events
[03:14] llrcombs: am I missing the bit where it chucks out nonstandard requests?
[03:16] llrcombs: why the fuck did Apple decide to use HTTP for this!?

[03:33] llrcombs: what type of libs are you talking about?
[03:33] SteveDekorte: here's one from today https://github.com/chrisa/node-rsa/issues/1
[03:34] seebees: SteveDekorte:can you build master on OSX right now?
[03:34] SteveDekorte: sudo port install node installed 0.6.2
[03:35] konobi: SteveDekorte: and you have XCode installed?
[03:35] SteveDekorte: konobi: yes
[03:35] konobi: huh... there's a bunch or crypto stuff in core... is that not sufficient
[03:36] nicholasf: noob js question
[03:36] nicholasf: is there an API online anywhere for Ecmascript 5?
[03:36] llrcombs: I think you need an argument for that, SteveDekorte 
[03:36] SteveDekorte: konobi: doesn't support RSA encryption or keygen, only signing
[03:36] nicholasf: nm, found something similar
[03:37] llrcombs: that, or you should be using createRsaKeypair instead of just RsaKeypair

[03:41] SteveDekorte: then I tried a bunch of 'pure' JS RSA code from the web, so far everything I've found depends on browser specific BigInt support
[03:41] adamstantonvan has joined the channel

[03:51] konobi: llrcombs: yeah, but look at the repo
[03:52] SteveDekorte: llrcombs: yeah TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'createRsaKeypair'
[03:52] konobi: how about passing it some arguments?
[03:52] SteveDekorte: llrcombs: there are lots of bigint implementations, the question is whether it's compatible

[04:06] ryan_stevens has joined the channel
[04:06] SteveDekorte: konobi: actually, do you use any sync methods?
[04:06] konobi: they're useful for while starting up the process (reading config file, etc)

[04:07] konobi: but once i hit the event loop proper... i don't
[04:08] towski has joined the channel
[04:08] SteveDekorte: konobi: ok, now imagine all the methods in the system were async

[04:13] SteveDekorte: looks like that bigint package isn't compatible with the browser BigInteger
[04:14] Marak: pquerna: im in the middle of refactor Hook.spawn to use our haibu-carapace project. this means i take any node.js application and i can wrap it in a hook
[04:14] thepatr1ck_ has joined the channel
[04:14] SteveDekorte: by the way, with coroutines all methods could be async without changing how you code
[04:15] Marak: ( without knowing anything about node.js app i am spawning )
[04:15] SteveDekorte: you just pause the calling coro until the callback comes in, then resume or reschedule it
[04:15] Aria: Except code is no longer exactly linear. Whenever you yield, your state can change.
[04:15] pquerna: Marak: hrm, its starting to sound insane in some ways :)
[04:15] SteveDekorte: Aria: it's not a problem in practice, it's how I implemented Io
[04:15] Marak: pquerna: going to need to rename some things i think
[04:15] Marak: pquerna: but its working well
[04:16] Marak: process.emit('email::send', {});
[04:16] Marak: etc
[04:16] SteveDekorte: Aria: people tend to confuse coroutines (which are cooperative threads) with os threads (which are not cooperative)
[04:16] pquerna: heh
[04:16] SteveDekorte: the later are non-deterministic
[04:16] Aria: Quite.
[04:16] Aria: But I actually dislike both -- I dislike having to keep the other states in my head.
[04:16] pquerna: Marak: btw are y'all using sendgrid or mailgun or something like that? any thoughts on em?
[04:16] Marak: pquerna: sendgrid for application, mailchimp for blast
[04:17] Marak: pquerna: sendgrid has *worked as advertised*. good enough for us so far, no issues
[04:17] pquerna: trying to decide between sendgrid and mailgun I guess.
[04:17] SteveDekorte: Aria: callbacks don't change that, you still have the callback scope state, and your other callbacks can unexpectedly change things in between
[04:17] pquerna: heard nothing bad about either
[04:17] Marak: ive never used the other service
[04:17] pquerna: which always has me worried :)
[04:18] seebees has left the channel
[04:18] Aria: Yes. But it's at the end of the callback, rather than mid-routine. It's just a different mental model.
[04:18] pquerna: Marak: are you using the SMTP api via node_mailer, or the https api directly?
[04:19] SS-X has joined the channel
[04:19] Marak: pquerna: https api
[04:19] Marak: pquerna: fuck SMTP
[04:19] SteveDekorte: Aria: but all of the state in the rest of your program may have changed in the meantime
[04:19] Marak: pquerna: we use mikeal's request lib
[04:19] pquerna: +1, fuck smtp.
[04:19] Marak: pquerna: node_mailer is a 2009 hack that has lived too long 
[04:19] pquerna: okay :)
[04:19] Aria: SteveDekorte: Exactly!
[04:19] Aria: Question is where you want that to happen.
[04:19] SteveDekorte: Aria: so you still have all the same conflicts as in a cooperative multitasking - it's really no different other than callbacks involve 10x the code
[04:20] pquerna: use the Events API for recv bounceback notifications at all?
[04:20] pquerna: (thats the main feature I want, to know if your email is bouncing)
[04:20] ceej has joined the channel
[04:20] Aria: SteveDekorte: Not in my experience. Just a different place to choose to break things up.
[04:20] SteveDekorte: Aria: callbacks are just the modern goto - it's how people programed before they had call stacks
[04:20] OneOfOne has joined the channel
[04:21] Aria: Oh, I'm well aware.
[04:21] Aria: So are exceptions and coroutines ;-)
[04:21] thepatr1ck_ has joined the channel
[04:22] Marak: pquerna: we dont care about that i think. we check out the bounces manually atm i think

[04:23] Marak: i dont want to do bounce checking

[06:28] Blorb has joined the channel
[06:29] thepatr1ck: async.waterfall is good for the kind of thing where you just end up with further and further indented code and is the one I've found most useful, async.auto is good for cases where you have functions that can be called at the same time, but that have dependencies on each other. but really it depends on the problem you are trying to solve.
[06:29] xeodox: i see. the indented problem is a huge problem!
[06:29] xeodox: i have like 10 levels of indented code sometimes
[06:30] chrislorenz has joined the channel
[06:30] Aria: That might be a hint that you should rework the flow of data within your app.
[06:31] thepatr1ck: the one it helped me the most with was a flow of handling a "create a sale, invoice it, charge the credit card, mark as paid, settle credit card" type thing - where every single step is async, and can (and will, because the universe is want to do so)) fail.

[08:06] felixge: you should
[08:06] raphdg has joined the channel
[08:07] felixge: doing response times as a histogram is a bad idea
[08:07] felixge: *** meter
[08:07] felixge: fuck, I told you I need coffee : )
[08:07] arlolra: i'm using the util
[08:07] arlolra: https://github.com/felixge/node-felix-metrics/blob/master/lib/util/Stopwatch.js
[08:07] arlolra: not the timer
[08:07] arlolra: well, timer update

[08:08] arlolra: felixge: if you're too tired, that's ok
[08:09] felixge: yeah I'm saying don't use the stopwatch by itself
[08:09] arlolra: isn't it just a convenient date.now()
[08:09] felixge: https://github.com/felixge/node-felix-metrics
[08:09] felixge: see the section that says "Timers"
[08:09] felixge: this is what you should do
[08:10] felixge: to measure response time thingies
[08:10] arlolra: right, but that wouldn't work across dnode ... latency
[08:10] arlolra: so i'm just using the stopwatch myself, and then updating
[08:10] felixge: ok
[08:11] arlolra: does that make sense?
[08:11] felixge: (just realizing you are using a timer for the response times, not a meter, sorry : )
[08:11] arlolra: the "advanced usage" here https://github.com/mikejihbe/metrics doesn't talk about timers
[08:11] felixge: yeah
[08:11] felixge: that could work
[08:12] mikeal: i use metrics
[08:12] mikeal: it's pretty nice
[08:12] arlolra: with timers?
[08:12] mikeal: yeah, you do them yourself
[08:12] mikeal: let me find you a good example
[08:12] arlolra: i think that's what i did
[08:12] arlolra: mikeal: https://gist.github.com/e26451ad8d8d75a8c21b
[08:13] felixge: mikeal: nice and wrong: https://github.com/mikejihbe/metrics/issues/9 :)
[08:13] felixge: and has no tests
[08:13] garrensmith has joined the channel
[08:14] arlolra: felixge: how were you planning on handling the case where you have lots of processes using this library and aggregating the data?
[08:14] felixge: arlolra: for now I'm using graphite
[08:14] felixge: which is awesome and loves me
[08:14] felixge: and lets me aggregate my individual process metrics as needed
[08:15] mikeal: i wrap it a little
[08:15] mikeal: https://github.com/mikeal/etherpad-lite/blob/metrics/node/metrics.js
[08:15] mikeal: https://github.com/mikeal/etherpad-lite/blob/metrics/node/handler/PadMessageHandler.js#L274
[08:16] aesptux has joined the channel
[08:16] mikeal: yeah, metrics has a built in way to aggregate but don't use it
[08:16] mikeal: just put the data in to Redis per process
[08:16] hackband has joined the channel
[08:16] mikeal: and you can easily use the metrics library to merge it when you pull it out of Redis
[08:17] kuebk has joined the channel
[08:18] neshaug has joined the channel
[08:18] felixge: mikeal: redis, really?
[08:18] felixge: have you tried graphite?
[08:18] felixge: it really really loves you
[08:18] felixge: :)
[08:18] felixge: or are you doing something else with that data?
[08:19] mikeal: so, metrics already creates a definitive number, and i update it in Redis every second
[08:19] mikeal: so it's one write per second per process
[08:19] mikeal: and then i just write little pages that show the data
[08:20] mikeal: i was doing graphs, using some javascript stuff, highcharts
[08:20] mikeal: but i've stopped for realtime metrics
[08:20] mikeal: they aren't useful
[08:20] mikeal: i just want proper numbers
[08:20] mikeal: displayed well
[08:20] mikedeboer has joined the channel
[08:21] mikeal: graphs are great for day over day usage, but i'm not doing much with that yet
[08:21] arlolra: are you just doing a setTimeout to get the data in redis?
[08:21] mikeal: setInterval :)
[08:21] arlolra: right
[08:21] arlolra: sorry
[08:21] mikeal: actually, setTimeout loop would be safer
[08:21] mikeal: but i'm not doing that
[08:22] arlolra: safer in what sense?
[08:22] arlolra: felixge: do you do the same for graphite?
[08:22] felixge: arlolra: setInterval with 10 seconds
[08:22] jtr__ has joined the channel
[08:22] felixge: which is my storage granularity for graphite
[08:23] arlolra: interesting. for some i thought that might not be wise
[08:23] felixge: graphiteClient.write(metrics.toJSON())
[08:23] felixge: simple
[08:23] arlolra: never trust my gut
[08:23] felixge: I'm still considering to run an aggregation daemon per machine
[08:23] npa has joined the channel
[08:23] felixge: because for my business metrics it's kind of wasteful to store them per process
[08:24] felixge: but oh well, for now that's ok
[08:24] arlolra: the aggregation daemon is something graphite gives you for free?
[08:25] arlolra: thanks for the help guys
[08:25] arlolra: felixge: i owe you a coffee
[08:26] felixge: arlolra: the answer is: yes and yes
[08:27] ablomen has joined the channel
[08:27] felixge: a) It allows you to aggregate data after the fact. That is, it makes it *really* easy to combine multiple graphs together as averages, sums, etc.
[08:27] felixge: b) It also comes with a daemon that can do aggregation for you, and you can configure that aggregation with wildcards on your path

[08:29] xeodox: hi felixge, when do you think transactions will be available for your library? :)

[08:30] felixge: which should solve most issues
[08:30] arlolra: ACTION loves the node community
[08:30] xeodox: oh wow…so we can expect transactions very soon!?

[10:30] elliottcable: it's just trying to make a common idiom/command of mine look less silly
[10:30] elliottcable: usually I would be doing `node =(cat file1.js file2.js)`, but that idiom is no longer working for me, as that leaves a file in /tmp where it can't access this project's `node_modules` directory

[11:42] alessioalex has joined the channel
[11:42] Glenjamin: in perl/python/php et al its not so bad because the program is procedural
[11:42] elliottcable: JavaScript is extremely synchronous and procedural.
[11:42] Glenjamin: but any IO you do means you get non linear program flow
[11:42] Glenjamin: and writing to stdout is IO
[11:42] elliottcable: Node provides *some* asynchronicity, but it’s not very pervasive.
[11:42] elliottcable: not like it was originally intended to be.
[11:42] elliottcable: no different than Ruby with EM, really.

[13:27] tanepiper: what the hell is chocolatey?
[13:28] tanepiper: also, npm install express will install express in the directory you are located
[13:28] tanepiper: so for example   cd C:\foo, npm install express, will put it in C:\foo\node_modules\express
[13:28] gripir: tanepiper: there is no npm for windows right?
[13:28] tanepiper: yes, there is
[13:28] gripir: oh.
[13:29] tanepiper: it's in master in the node repo now, will be with the next release, but in the meantime you need to download it via git
[13:29] gripir: good to know ... do you have an example or how to install it?
[13:29] gripir: ah ok
[13:29] tanepiper: then type:   node cli.js install npm

[13:43] cmr has joined the channel
[13:43] yebyen: since node does not compile on that platform i was assuming no
[13:43] yebyen: dubenstein: yeah
[13:44] yebyen: it's great :)
[13:44] yebyen: i suppose i should be ready to produce a pastebin...
[13:44] yebyen: DEST_OS: generic
[13:44] dubenstein: yebyen: i guess it's not production ready
[13:44] yebyen: this is the part that worries me
[13:45] yebyen: dubenstein: you would be surprised how many things just can't handle $(uname)=GNU/kFreeBSD
[13:45] badlearner1 has joined the channel
[13:45] yebyen: if you can send "FreeBSD" wherever they are not expecting that string
[13:45] yebyen: almost everything will just go ahead and compile
[13:45] dubenstein: yebyen: hehe))
[13:46] cmr: It seems there are bunches of irc libraries out there. Does anyone have a recommendation for any of them? Are there any to avoid?
[13:46] dubenstein: yebyen: i'll try it now on my openstack cloud
[13:46] badlearner1: Hello all. I have a problem - - if I have to choose between Python & Node.js which would you suggest I go with? Is Node.js good enough for building a social network entirely from scratch?
[13:46] yebyen: so far at least golang
[13:46] jondot: badlearner1: if you are a bad learner it doesn't matter what you pick :)
[13:46] yebyen: golang really needs some patches though, they were nice enough to package that and produce deb-src for it
[13:47] badlearner1: I try to be though... so tell me
[13:47] yebyen: you're going to need a lot of callbacks
[13:47] dubenstein: badlearner1: both are great
[13:47] badlearner1: Is Node.js good enough for building a social network entirely from scratch?
[13:47] yebyen: alright dubenstein workin on a pastebin for you
[13:48] cmr: badlearner1: What is a social network?
[13:48] badlearner1: consider Facebook
[13:48] dubenstein: badlearner1: both are great for anything you can think of))
[13:48] cmr: badlearner1: Sure
[13:48] badlearner1: great
[13:49] hipsterslapfight: i'd also consider whether we need another social network :v
[13:49] dubenstein: yebyen: pastebin?)) tell me how can i contribute 
[13:49] badlearner1: I am considering Node.js because basically (1) I would have to learn JavaScript anyway, and (2) It's faster than Python and Ruby
[13:49] yebyen: dubenstein: find someone with a real FreeBSD workstation
[13:49] yebyen: dubenstein: and see if their make.log from node looks like this
[13:50] yebyen: ... *drumroll*

[13:52] yebyen: dubenstein: don't suppose you are a freebsd user?
[13:52] cmr: badlearner1: what's your killer feature that the others lack?
[13:53] dubenstein: yebyen: I was (long time ago), wrote billing for gnugatekeeper and netflow running on freebsd machine
[13:54] badlearner1: @cmr: they all have features, but those features haven't been implemented at their best + My photosharing site would be a one-stop solution coz your photos will be backed up across multiple data centers in DIFFERENT Continent + We dont delete your photos without contacting you and giving you a 10-day timeframe to get back to us.
[13:54] Morkel: Why does "sudo make install" not work with node.js 6.0.2?
[13:54] cmr: badlearner1: cool.
[13:55] jbpros has joined the channel
[13:55] badlearner1: Basically, you only worry about sharing. I worry about usability. And most important of all? This idea sprung from my need for a proper place to store my photos without having to worry about losing them, getting them deleted etc
[13:55] dubenstein: yebyen: does v8 compile ?
[13:55] badlearner1: So, Node.js good for all this, right?

[14:02] dubenstein: yebyen: yep
[14:02] yebyen: how can it be not ready
[14:02] yebyen: just because sshd stops accepting connections once a month or week or every two months as a surprise if you don't watch it
[14:03] yebyen: that can be resolved by restarting it periodically
[14:03] yebyen: (sshd, not the kernel)

[14:04] hipsterslapfight: i'll have to agree that something probably isn't production ready if you have to turn it off and on again every week :v

[14:04] yebyen: hipsterslapfight: that's just sshd

[14:05] yebyen: and i can at least sshd restart
[14:05] yebyen: dubenstein: the failure is to expect that all versions of uname on all FreeBSD platforms will produce the string FreeBSD
[14:06] yebyen: many compilation scripts wind up looking in /usr/include/GNU/kFreeBSD.h
[14:06] yebyen: because they just take that string and use it everywhere
[14:07] dubenstein: yebyen: it's in «release in progress» stage

[15:44] ovaillancourt: Looking for someone who would be well versed into base64 encoding and smtp transfers :P anyone?
[15:44] baudehlo: ACTION waves
[15:44] baudehlo: ACTION knows a little bit about SMTP (where a little bit = a lot0
[15:45] Aria has joined the channel
[15:45] ovaillancourt: baudehlo: alrighty, not sure it's precisely related to smtp but you might have seen that situation before
[15:46] baudehlo: maybe...
[15:46] ovaillancourt: baudehlo: so basically, I'm trying to send a multipart email, w/ base64 encoding for the html part (encoded through Buffer.toString('base64')). What happens is that on some mail servers, the email I receive has newline characters in the base64 chunk
[15:46] ovaillancourt: which basically breaks the mail rendering in the client
[15:47] hotch has joined the channel
[15:47] ovaillancourt: on other servers, I receive it correctly... (for example, I have the newlines on webfaction, but no newline on gmail)
[15:47] sreeix has joined the channel
[15:47] baudehlo: sounds…. odd.
[15:47] ovaillancourt: ever heard of something that might explain that?
[15:47] ovaillancourt: yeah :/
[15:48] baudehlo: encoding maybe?
[15:48] ovaillancourt: yeah, tried with utf8 and it's working fine... but I'd rather not use utf8 to send mails around...
[15:49] hotch: anyone using #travis here?
[15:49] ovaillancourt: and the actual encoding that comes our from node appears to be correct, it seems like the problem appears when the whole things goes through the socket or something
[15:49] baudehlo: no I mean when you set the content type, are you giving the right charset value?
[15:50] ovaillancourt: oh, hang on :P 
[15:50] baudehlo: and what are you using to send email?
[15:50] ovaillancourt: emailjs
[15:50] baudehlo: k
[15:50] baudehlo: doesn't emailjs do the encoding for you?
[15:50] ovaillancourt: yeah the charset is ok
[15:50] baudehlo: Maybe it's double-encoding it.
[15:50] ovaillancourt: yeah it does :P I've basically been digging in the code for 2 days now trying to fix that :P
[15:50] baudehlo: lol
[15:51] ovaillancourt: I know I'm not encoding it "myself" actually, emailjs does it
[15:51] rskuja has joined the channel
[15:51] ovaillancourt: https://github.com/eleith/emailjs/issues/14
[15:52] ovaillancourt: if you're curious, there's an example of a "correct" mail as received by gmail, and a "broken" one as received by webfaction
[15:52] ovaillancourt: they are the exact same mail, sent at the same time
[15:52] baudehlo: alternatively I'd take the source of the email (from the destination server), copy the base64 part out, and paste it into something that does the decoding (mimencode or base64 on the mac) and pipe that through hexdump -C
[15:53] baudehlo: wtf why are the lines that long??
[15:53] ovaillancourt: mostly my "test" mail
[15:53] baudehlo: Oh. So I understand the problem now.
[15:53] ovaillancourt: oh!
[15:54] idl3 has joined the channel
[15:54] baudehlo: clearly converting to base64 isn't splitting into reasonable line lengths.
[15:54] baudehlo: and yes, some receiving servers will split for you, sometimes fucking things up.
[15:54] ovaillancourt: ok, the lines must have certain lengths?
[15:54] ovaillancourt: ok
[15:54] rskuja: Hello everyone,im trying to figure out what might be causing slow new fail serving in my node-express setup. I have picture uploader set up, it loads image to server fast, but when trying to reach the image through broswer it shows up only after like 2-3mins. I wonder if its some sort of catching or whatever else might be involved in this.
[15:55] kuebk has left the channel
[15:55] ovaillancourt: any workaround/recommendation on what I could do about that?
[15:55] rskuja: i also added a bit detailed question to stackoverflow http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8255807/valums-file-uploader-on-nodejs-multiple-file-upload
[15:56] Aria: Base64 should support line breaks in it. . . Weird. It's normally at 64 or 78 characters.
[15:57] ovaillancourt: ok, there's a fix to emailjs that was submitted recently for email attachments that actually did something like this I think
[15:57] ovaillancourt: not sure though, https://github.com/eleith/emailjs/pull/6
[15:58] ovaillancourt: would it be possible that they needed to apply the fix to html part of messages too, given they're also base64 encoded, but they forgot?

[16:07] francisl: Hi, can we use native webworker or we have to use the external library?
[16:07] ovaillancourt: baudehlo: I think I'll take a closer look at the lib when I have a bit more spare time
[16:07] baudehlo: ovaillancourt: the outbound seems to work well, it's just one of those things that I can't benchmark - because I'd have to basically become a spammer to test it.
[16:08] ovaillancourt: oh, yeah I see what you mean
[16:08] baudehlo: I've tested it delivering to  a local "sink" though.
[16:08] baudehlo: but that's nothing like a real-world test.
[16:08] ovaillancourt: yeah
[16:08] ovaillancourt: so basically it's a full blown mail server with user accounts and everything?
[16:09] vvo has joined the channel
[16:09] baudehlo: no user accounts.
[16:09] baudehlo: I keep thinking of adding an IMAP server to it, but that's a huge undertaking.
[16:10] baudehlo: and people are so fussy about how/where their email gets stored.
[16:10] ovaillancourt: yeah I read you on that
[16:11] baudehlo: so for now the best thing is to just be a proxy to something else.
[16:11] ovaillancourt: yeah, I can clearly see it be useful for anything related to mail automation though
[16:12] rskuja: im using smtp emailjs for outgoing and python imap for incoming.. kinda strange setup.. but node imap is bit hard to get working like i needed

[17:57] AvianFlu: it's entirely possible.  is that `fileStream` defined somewhere else?  there's no `var` in front of it on your SO post
[17:57] AvianFlu: which would make it a leaked global, which would mean that each upload would clobber the same file, maybe

[18:07] tjholowaychuk: doesn't hurt to start with js though
[18:07] rskuja: sure go nodejs
[18:07] badlearner1: like I said I am an absolute starter at programming, and JavaScript would be the first I learn. So, would it be very difficult to write a library as a beginner?
[18:07] arcanis has joined the channel
[18:07] `3rdEden has joined the channel
[18:07] jstash: not very difficult.
[18:08] badlearner1: Just asking, how many days would it take to write a custom library from scratch?
[18:08] rskuja: most of libraries/modules are already there even for flickr and stuff :)
[18:08] deedubs: what does this custom library do?
[18:08] jstash: tons of examples for you to follow, plus docs http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.6.2/api/modules.html
[18:08] badlearner1: (anything, its just an instance)
[18:08] jstash: badlearner1: how long depends on if your nickname is true ;)
[18:08] rskuja: http://toolbox.no.de/ <- also good link
[18:09] jstash: ah, right, forgot about toolbox
[18:09] badlearner1: @jstash - - consider yourself then
[18:09] deedubs: badlearner1: It'll take about 200 days
[18:09] badlearner1: plz
[18:09] badlearner1: really?
[18:09] jstash: badlearner1: an hour for the basic stuff, then days-to-months depending on how complex the subject matter is
[18:09] badlearner1: okay
[18:10] badlearner1: but the most basic / important stuff are already available, correct?
[18:10] deedubs: well in my instance I'm thinking of a library that can replace a cars MCU
[18:10] jstash: badlearner1: right, basic stuff is just following the documentation on how to make a node module
[18:10] lee_ has joined the channel
[18:10] jstash: quite easy.
[18:10] badlearner1: okay. That feels better. Thanks @jstash. Good day! :D
[18:11] jstash: most of that hour is picking a good name for the module, likely.
[18:11] jstash: j/k

[19:02] tjholowaychuk: depends how much you care
[19:02] rails_noob: can it run on any server or what because from what i understand it is the server
[19:02] tjholowaychuk: or how lazy you are
[19:02] rails_noob: or something like that
[19:02] martin_sunset has joined the channel
[19:02] rails_noob: at work we run some crappy apache vps witha  cpanel, could i get node up there without being a linux master
[19:03] Aria: Yes, but don't expect getting it to talk on port 80 is going to be easy in that case, unless the host will let you run proxies (which it might with mod_rewrite magic)
[19:04] jbrokc_ has joined the channel
[19:05] rails_noob: is 80 the default port?
[19:05] rskuja: ^that.. on other case if u want something to test your stuff just take some free hosting service... I deployed my stuff on Amazon EC2 in about 30min 
[19:05] Aria: 80 is the normal web port, yes.
[19:06] rails_noob: yeah, i think ec2 might be what i need, i just want to get started and try hacking some stuff together in a couple weekends

[19:23] Aria: josh9: But that said, it's good for ~any network programming. It's low-level, lower than Rails.
[19:24] maushu has joined the channel

[19:24] Lingerance: Only lib-uv is low-level.
[19:25] Glenjamin: low level has many meanings

[19:25] creationix has joined the channel
[19:25] stride: I'm sitting
[19:25] chilts: yes, depends on perspective and experience :)
[19:25] Aria: But it's also easy to build on, so the HTTP layer is easy and well rounded. And on top of that, connect and then express build.
[19:25] Aria: But it's different than Rails -- it's even more app-server centric than Rails is. Hard to believe, but true.
[19:26] Aria: (Express is more like the analogue to Rails.)
[19:26] Aria: (Or Sinatra, anyway.)
[19:26] tjholowaychuk: node does IMO what any good abstraction should do, start with the low-level and build up. monolithic frameworks are kinda meh
[19:26] Aria: Indeed.
[19:26] Aria: It's a lot of small parts that work remarkably well together.
[19:27] Aria: The concept of event emitters, a few common patterns of events --- that really made things gel well.
[19:27] chilts: reminds me of lisp (for obvious reasons) ... you kinda build your own language up

[19:41] jbrokc: marcello3d: dunno, to me it just delivers an easy BDD experience i'm familiar with that Vows didn't

[19:41] jbrokc: jasmine's nice too but it's so ugly
[19:41] jbrokc: marcello3d: dunno
[19:41] marcello3d: it's super simple
[19:42] tjholowaychuk: marcello3d the similarity with nodeunit is that it's executed serially
[19:42] tjholowaychuk: which gives you more power as far as reporting goes
[19:42] marcello3d: right
[19:42] tjholowaychuk: specifically error reporting
[19:42] secoif: tjholowaychuk what happened to async
[19:42] marcello3d: you can be async and serial
[19:42] einaros: tjholowaychuk: glad to see you brought regex matching to mocha. I couldn't live without that ;)
[19:43] tjholowaychuk: 100% parallel is too wonky haha it's great until you have to actually debug something
[19:43] marcello3d: you could do parallel if you forked
[19:43] tjholowaychuk: surprisingly it's not really much slower
[19:43] konobi: test code really needs to be executed 100% serially
[19:43] tjholowaychuk: i ported the express tests and it's a bit slower but not by much
[19:43] tjholowaychuk: maybe 100ms
[19:43] marcello3d: tj: %?

[19:43] marcello3d: that's why I like nodeunit
[19:44] marcello3d: vowsjs just had waaaay too much bloat/overhead for me
[19:44] marcello3d: plus it couldn't do certain styles of tests
[19:44] Glenjamin: the topic reuse is odd
[19:44] Glenjamin: shared state between tests :s

[19:44] secoif: I don't get why you need 100% serial
[19:45] nmtmason has joined the channel
[19:45] Glenjamin: tjholowaychuk: your mocha library has roughly the same syntax and goals as mine, was started later, and is much better >.<
[19:45] Glenjamin: secoif: consider mocked dependencies
[19:45] konobi: secoif: test code should be as simple as possible... and executed as simply as possible
[19:45] tjholowaychuk: secoif makes it trivial to map uncaught exceptions, global leaks etc
[19:45] secoif: some parts, for sure, but being able to run certain sections in parallel could really help keep tests quick
[19:45] tjholowaychuk: to a specific case
[19:45] blueadept` has joined the channel
[19:45] secoif: sure, I'm thinking
[19:45] marcello3d: anyone using travis-ci?
[19:45] tjholowaychuk: marcello3d yup
[19:45] marcello3d: it's badass huh?
[19:45] tjholowaychuk: tried it out for mocha
[19:46] tjholowaychuk: pretty handy
[19:46] Glenjamin: secoif: proper unit tests don't do much (or any) IO
[19:46] marcello3d: I like that it can test multiple versions of node
[19:46] secoif: run tests parallel if break, run in serial if broken
[19:46] marcello3d: cause I know I'll never do that ;)
[19:46] Glenjamin: so "parallel" makes no difference
[19:46] secoif: Glenjamin Agreed, but sometimes time doesn't allow for proper unit tests
[19:46] jbrokc: anyone here use zombie's cookies module?
[19:46] marcello3d: secoif: not a bad idea
[19:47] marcello3d: I think the forking approach probably gives you the best of both worlds. fork each test file and run it separately
[19:47] secoif: for example, I have tests that use this library called knox, and I have no idea how to go about mocking it out 
[19:47] Glenjamin: tjholowaychuk: any plans for something like RSpec's "let" declaration?
[19:47] marcello3d: you also have the potential for library global variable bugs that would be non-deterministic with parallel tests
[19:47] secoif: so i have this chunk of about 10 tests that take about 30 seconds to run
[19:47] tjholowaychuk: marcello3d then you have ~50ms or whatever overhead for that as well

[20:24] augustl: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.12/api/fs.html#fs.rename ?
[20:25] AvianFlu: I don't think rename can move it to other directories?
[20:25] AvianFlu: (haven't tried)
[20:25] Margle has joined the channel
[20:25] augustl: I'm pretty sure it can
[20:25] vkandy: hmm didn't think of that augustl .. i'll try rename
[20:26] deadmau5: fs.rename is just rename(2) no?

[20:30] vkandy: augustl: fs.rename() worked nicely! thanks :)
[20:30] AvianFlu: if you're using big files, it's a better way to move them (chunk by chunk I mean)
[20:31] AvianFlu: I'm glad rename worked, though
[20:31] AvianFlu: can you move it to a different folder with rename? I'm curious
[20:31] cjm has joined the channel
[20:31] vkandy: AvianFlu: i was using util.pump but it took forever!
[20:31] deadmau5: rename is a syscall, it's no-doubt much more efficient
[20:31] christine has joined the channel
[20:31] augustl: AvianFlu: for big files, rename is probably a zillion times better
[20:32] AvianFlu: yeah that's true, you're just changing the entry in the file-table-thing
[20:32] xetorthio: Hi! Using node 0.4.12, after doing several http.get calls I get a "EINVAL, Invalid argument" all the time. is a node.js bug?
[20:32] AvianFlu: the data doesn't need to move
[20:32] augustl: and be mapped to user space memory
[20:32] AvianFlu: right
[20:33] AvianFlu: I was thinking buffering vs. non-buffering, but not moving it at all clearly wins :)
[20:33] vkandy: what if the destination was a different disk? curious

[20:34] augustl: vkandy: EXDEV  oldpath  and  newpath  are  not on the same mounted file system.  (Linux permits a file system to be mounted at multiple points, but rename() does not work across different mount points, even if the same file system is mounted o
[20:34] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[20:34] augustl: from man 2 rename
[20:34] badlearner1: I have been reading about Node.js all of today and I see one big disadvantage being pointed out by everyone - - it's not production ready and that every new release is backwards incompatible and breaks all existing libraries etc. Is this true?
[20:35] augustl: so if that's what node uses it won't work. But not sure if that's what nod euses.
[20:35] augustl: badlearner1: not sure what production ready really means.. The releases are some times backwards incompatible though. That's to be expected of a 0.x release
[20:35] TheJH: badlearner1, every major release so far did break some libraries that used deprecated stuff, yes
[20:36] AvianFlu: sometimes, the old way of doing something was bad, and needs to break to improve
[20:36] AvianFlu: nobody will change version x.y.z after you install it, though
[20:36] badlearner1: Does the work load get too heavy for developers or is it workable?
[20:36] mmalecki: badlearner1: are you a Java developer, by a chance?
[20:36] vkandy: augustl: that makes sense ... i'll keep that mind
[20:37] badlearner1: No way. I am an absolute beginner wondering which path to choose: Python/django or JavaScript/Node.js
[20:37] mmalecki: badlearner1: sure it is :). most nodejitsu packages got ported in a week or so
[20:37] mmalecki: badlearner1: and we have like 50 of them!

[20:38] AvianFlu: badlearner1, I actually think that it will be easier for you to learn JS first
[20:38] augustl: badlearner1: I've not had any problems with either, but that's just me :)
[20:38] AvianFlu: there are a few quirky things in JS that will be a lot harder to grasp if you go python first
[20:38] AvianFlu: if you don't have a sense of "but that's not how the other guys do it!" you'll be able to pick it all up quicker, I should think
[20:39] AvianFlu: then, later, python will be easier to learn
[20:39] badlearner1: okay. So it's like when there's a new release I take my time, see when all the modules/libraries become compatible with the new Node.js release and start the upgrade process?
[20:39] mmalecki: badlearner1: that's what we've done
[20:39] AAA_awright_0: I've very rarely had any issues with broken APIs, I can't actually recall one
[20:39] badlearner1: okay
[20:40] AAA_awright_0: And I've been working on master branch since v0.2
[20:40] badlearner1: Is JavaScript going to die anytime soon? I am definitely worried about lot of bloggers saying stuff like that
[20:40] badlearner1: Are browsers going to abandon it anytime soon?
[20:40] AvianFlu: no
[20:40] vkandy: augustl: i was thinking .. can i catch  EXDEV on callback to fs.rename ? 
[20:40] AvianFlu: like, no way in hell
[20:40] augustl: badlearner1: vkandy not sure how that works tbh
[20:40] AvianFlu: badlearner1, it's too intrenched to vanish quickly
[20:40] AvianFlu: entrenched, rather
[20:41] augustl: badlearner1: who says JavaScript is going to die?
[20:41] augustl: quite the contrary
[20:41] AvianFlu: a lot of people hate it and want it to go away
[20:41] AvianFlu: but it's just hatefully wishful thinking
[20:41] badlearner1: search "JavaScript dead"
[20:41] vkandy: whoever says JS is going to die should look at Dart
[20:41] AvianFlu: yeah seriously, lol
[20:41] zomg: Lot of people hate Java and want it to go away
[20:41] zomg: Lot of people hate PHP and want it to go away...
[20:41] zomg: ;>
[20:41] AvianFlu: flash, too
[20:41] AvianFlu: nothing "just vanishes"
[20:41] AvianFlu: COBOL is still used places
[20:41] augustl: especially a open web standard
[20:42] AvianFlu: javascript is one of hundreds of programming languages, if not thousands
[20:42] badlearner1: What actually worries me is that there's no new release of JavaScript for like 2 years now, while Python, Ruby and all have had one last month or so
[20:42] AvianFlu: at the end of the day, everybody picks a few
[20:42] augustl: badlearner1: what do you mean new release of JavaScript :P
[20:42] AvianFlu: badlearner1, you're conflating the language and the VM
[20:42] badlearner1: what??
[20:42] AvianFlu: there are 4 or 5 major javascript VMs
[20:42] maxogden: badlearner1: node has very little to do with javascript in a philosophical sense
[20:42] AvianFlu: spidermonkey, v8 (which node uses), a few others
[20:42] augustl: badlearner1: the language itself, you mean? Most of the innovation these days are the enrivonment in which JavaScript run
[20:42] badlearner1: okay
[20:42] AvianFlu: whereas the language itself is a standard
[20:43] augustl: what AvianFlu said
[20:43] badlearner1: okay
[20:43] AvianFlu: Ruby is a language, but it's also a VM
[20:43] Glenjamin: JavaScript has roughly the same features, and keeps getting faster. Python & Ruby keep getting new features and getting a bit slower
[20:43] badlearner1: lol
[20:43] AvianFlu: when you see "Ruby 1.9", it's a release of the VM
[20:43] jbrokc_ has joined the channel
[20:43] badlearner1: yeah, I read about that
[20:43] AvianFlu: the languages change with the VMs, but it's not a version number on the language
[20:43] augustl: yeah the only new thing in ruby 1.9 is hash literal syntax and a few minor things afaik
[20:43] Marak: !kick AvianFlu
[20:43] badlearner1: So are you people sure that JavaScript is going to be around for at least the next 10 years or so?
[20:43] Marak: ACTION >.>
[20:44] AvianFlu: Marak: no bot here, learn2modecommand
[20:44] maxogden: AvianFlu: there is active competition amongst VMs in both ruby and python to be fair
[20:44] augustl: badlearner1: no, yes, what, why?
[20:44] AvianFlu: maxogden, yes, there is
[20:44] badlearner1: ah?!
[20:44] AvianFlu: PyPy beats the hell out of CPython, as I recall
[20:44] augustl: badlearner1: does it matter?
[20:44] _dc has joined the channel
[20:44] mmalecki: AvianFlu: yeah, it does

[20:44] lupomontero has joined the channel
[20:44] badlearner1: Because when I develop something in JavaScript I don't want to see in news that "JavaScript is dead, start porting fellows!"
[20:45] vkandy: badlearner1: i'd say yes. it won't be the same as it is now. it will evolve but it will remain
[20:45] AvianFlu: because programming is programming, it's just a question of how things are structured
[20:45] Marak: badlearner1: find a better place to read your news then
[20:45] zomg: badlearner1: in 10 years JS will still be but there's probably a new "cool" language
[20:45] augustl: badlearner1: has that ever happened with any language?
[20:45] Unknown53136: BASIC
[20:45] Unknown53136: ACTION coughs
[20:45] badlearner1: IDK... I am not into programming yer
[20:45] AvianFlu: Unknown53136, that was my first programming language!
[20:45] badlearner1: yet*
[20:45] Glenjamin: even if javascript "dies", code running today won't stop working on what its running on today.
[20:45] vkandy: js (as a language) is basically c flavored lisp. i wish more languages were like js
[20:45] Unknown53136: :P
[20:45] augustl: badlearner1: thought so ;) It doesn't really matter
[20:46] augustl: badlearner1: if a community of millions is using something it won't get replaced overnight
[20:46] zomg: badlearner1: if you actually plan to learn programming, I'd stop worrying about what language is going to stick
[20:46] AvianFlu: badlearner1, pick one you like and start making stuff.  I'd make a web app in node, and I'd do heavy math in python, personally.
[20:46] AvianFlu: each has its place
[20:46] badlearner1: okay
[20:46] AvianFlu: and many are roughly equivalent from a practical standpoint
[20:47] badlearner1: I feel a lot better now
[20:48] badlearner1: I will probably go with JavaScript / Node.js / jQuery stack
[20:48] badlearner1: it's all JS! :D
[20:49] badlearner1: And hey, next up is the confusion as to which DB to use. Any advise there?

[20:51] maxogden: tbranyen: cant tell if awesome or crazy
[20:51] augustl: seems like node-waf doesn't work on python 2.7.2

[20:52] AvianFlu: badlearner1, different dbs are good and bad at different things, but if you're just learning, you most likely won't need the sweet spots to matter
[20:52] AvianFlu: so learn one, be aware of what it sucks at
[20:52] zorzar has joined the channel
[20:52] tbranyen: augustl: and it works on python 2.5?
[20:52] AvianFlu: it's a specialized choice per-purpose, at the end of the day
[20:52] tbranyen: or another version
[20:52] augustl: tbranyen: haven't tested
[20:52] tbranyen: so why are you laying it on 2.7.2 instead of maybe a bad configuration?
[20:53] badlearner1: From what I read MongoDB and CouchDB are good for Node.js, and CouchDB is probably better (at least for starters) as it is asynchronous out of the box. hmm??
[20:53] augustl: tbranyen: haha, sorry
[20:53] augustl: tbranyen: just looked like a python error, but I've never worked with python
[20:53] maxogden: badlearner1: couchdb speaks HTTP so you only have to know HTTP to use it

[20:58] TheJH: wasn't mongo that one with the bad publicity?
[20:58] augustl: fud

Even those beginner's books for programming show problems with MySQL etc, OTOH the books about DBMSs talk about a programming language in examples.
[21:01] MooGoo: wtf
[21:01] badlearner1: I just dont get it, or is it only me?
[21:01] mmalecki: they deploy gig-or-so exacutable to their servers
[21:01] zomg: badlearner1: you don't even need a database

[21:03] chilts: MooGoo: they still have a place though, when it's the right tool for the job (same with NoSQL/KeyValue/Document stores)
[21:03] badlearner1: Okay guys! I get it. For instance lets think that I am pretty okay to start writing an app in JS. Now, I definitely need to worry about a DB right? So, how should I decide which DB is best for me?
[21:03] chilts: everything has it's place :)
[21:03] augustl: badlearner1: again..... less tools, more problem solving
[21:03] badlearner1: Every effing DB's description today states that it's the best, most scalable and fastest db in the world
[21:03] augustl: badlearner1: short answer, look at the problem you need solving and what the DBs are capable of

[21:05] augustl: badlearner1: sort of, I guess
[21:05] chilts: I just wanna do it
[21:05] augustl: badlearner1: short answer is, do you need to store tabular data? use a relational db like mysql, postgres, sqlite. Do you need to store documents? use a document db like mongodb, couchdb
[21:05] augustl: but that's a terribly generic answer
[21:06] badlearner1: okay

[21:27] AAA_awright_0: Yo
[21:27] staar2: I am currently struggling with one node solution but i dont know how to do it correctly
[21:28] AvianFlu: staar2, what are you trying to do?
[21:29] staar2: i am calling out and function which checks if the name is in file, and then it prints the result into console, but the other function needs to make requests if the name is not in file
[21:29] boltR has joined the channel
[21:29] _dc has joined the channel
[21:29] staar2: like if (isInFileName('Myke')) print 'Well done wait other input' else sendRequests()
[21:30] maxogden has joined the channel
[21:30] staar2: but the problem is that i cant make return
[21:30] staar2: it must be made as async

[21:32] Klaus_Dieter: can I build node on arm?
[21:32] konobi: yes
[21:32] Sorella has joined the channel
[21:32] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[21:32] Klaus_Dieter: konobi: I am trying to but ./configure make make install fails as cc does not recognize -m32 flag
[21:33] binaryjohn has joined the channel
[21:33] konobi: Klaus_Dieter: it's a lot more involved than normal builds... there are guides out on the interwebs on how to do it though
[21:33] Klaus_Dieter: konobi:  too bad - I have been looking on the node wiki only
[21:33] rskuja: staar2: well u could add callback to your isInFileName function, like isInFileName('Mike',callback) then do the check and return callback

[21:38] i42n has joined the channel
[21:39] Klaus_Dieter: konobi: yeah but that will not work with what is in git currently
[21:39] bnoordhuis: Klaus_Dieter: make sure to `git checkout v0.6.2`
[21:39] Klaus_Dieter: I am trying out an older version now
[21:39] hipsterslapfight has joined the channel
[21:39] bnoordhuis: building master on arm is even more of a challenge than usual right now
[21:40] Klaus_Dieter: bnoordhuis:  that might be my problem...
[21:40] TheJH: because you can't "make install" :D
[21:40] rskuja: staar2: well then return "error" calback if it isnt
[21:40] johnnywengluu: there should be a mkdir -p in the node.js core
[21:41] rskuja: staar2: or the callback could be like function(err){} where err is optional
[21:42] rskuja: staar2: imagination :) everything is possible

[21:46] xeodox: hey guys…what's the best Node.js module that lets me handle REST (CRUD) ?
[21:47] augustl: xeodox: express does routing on verbs and url
[21:47] augustl: if that's what you mean
[21:47] xeodox: what does "verbs" mean?
[21:47] augustl: xeodox: the "method" of the request
[21:47] xeodox: augustl: , right now I do this:    app.post('/api/account/create', api_account_ctr.pst_account_create);
[21:48] tjholowaychuk: xeodox express-resource?
[21:48] xeodox: but to me this seems very "manual", and I can't imagine doing this for 20-30 endpoints
[21:48] tjholowaychuk: https://github.com/visionmedia/express-resource
[21:48] tjholowaychuk: maybe give that a try
[21:48] tjholowaychuk: I prefer explicit personally
[21:48] joshgillies has joined the channel
[21:48] xeodox: tjholowaychuk: you prefer NOT to use express-resource…and do it manually ?
[21:48] tjholowaychuk: yup
[21:48] xeodox: Is that what you mean by "explicit"?
[21:49] xeodox: but it's much more tedious right?
[21:49] tjholowaychuk: typing != bottleneck, ever
[21:49] xeodox: I see
[21:49] xeodox: control is the best, right?

[22:49] johnnywengluu: tjholowaychuk: yo .. i can't figure this simple example code out https://gist.github.com/1392463 it says timeout of 2000s exceeded .. you know what the issue is? the folder is successfully created
[22:50] tjholowaychuk: johnnywengluu just do fs.mkdir(dir, done)
[22:50] tjholowaychuk: the other thing you're doing there
[22:50] tjholowaychuk: doesn't do anything
[22:51] johnnywengluu: tjholowaychuk: 1. why isn't it doing anything? it's calling done() ?
[22:52] enmand has joined the channel
[22:52] johnnywengluu: 2. it didn't work even though i changed it :/
[22:52] tjholowaychuk: if (err) return done(err);
[22:52] tjholowaychuk: done()
[22:52] tjholowaychuk: is exactly the same as
[22:52] tjholowaychuk: dosomething(done)
[22:52] johnnywengluu: oh you meant that
[22:52] johnnywengluu: but then the problem is not how i wrote it .. it still doens't work any clue?
[22:52] RyanW has left the channel
[22:53] tjholowaychuk: looks fine
[22:53] tjholowaychuk: try putting the beforeEach in a describe()
[22:53] tjholowaychuk: though it has a global suite
[22:53] tjholowaychuk: so that should be fine
[22:54] johnnywengluu: tjholowaychuk: https://gist.github.com/1392463 here is the output .. a bug?
[22:54] tjholowaychuk: shove some console.logs in there
[22:54] tjholowaychuk: is it actually taking that long?
[22:54] tjholowaychuk: (doubt it)
[22:54] tjholowaychuk: perhaps coffeescript is generating something mocha doesnt like
[22:55] johnnywengluu: tjholowaychuk: i put beforeEach inside describe but the problem remains 
[22:55] johnnywengluu: i try in js

[23:01] johnnywengluu: no
[23:01] johnnywengluu: 0.6.0

[23:03] tomyan has joined the channel
[23:03] secretjudge: id like to know whether it's "best practice" to use the redis session store with the redis-client
[23:04] johnnywengluu: tjholowaychuk: wiii thanks for the help!
[23:05] jacobrask has joined the channel
[23:06] secretjudge: hello?
[23:06] johnnywengluu: world
[23:06] secretjudge: :-)
[23:06] ovaillancourt: secretjudge: is it for express?
[23:08] ovaillancourt: (or connect?)
[23:08] secretjudge: so, here's the deal: if I'm using the session store, i get to store objects in a particular session.  However, I'd also like to do "redis" operations on some of these objects.  Is it "bad" to have both the redis session store AND the redis client and store the session in the store, but the objects through the client?
[23:08] secretjudge: is that an overkill?
[23:09] secretjudge: moreover, I'd like to have some association between the two. I suppose I'd have to expire the objects in my redis client by using a timestamp?
[23:10] ovaillancourt: ok, but are you talking about connect/express sessions or some other session module?
[23:10] ovaillancourt: or a session module that you coded yourself
[23:11] ovaillancourt: oh
[23:12] ovaillancourt: so you mean mixing up session data with "client" data in the same redis store?

[23:16] jellosea: this probably isn't a node.js specific question, but i'm trying to write a unit test for a piece of code that accepts a udp packet, parses it and calls a specifi function call in another module. whats the right way to unit test this? i want to pass it a dummy udp packet and then just ensure that the proper function call is called with the right parameters. how can i check that a function call is called properly through a unit test?
[23:16] _unary_ has joined the channel
[23:16] mmalecki: jellosea: monkey-patch/mock it
[23:17] jellosea: mmalecki: whats monley-patch
[23:17] jellosea: *monkey
[23:17] jellosea: or how do i mock it?
[23:17] jellosea: how do i mock it such that i can tell that its beign called
[23:17] zomg: jellosea: well I'd assume you can pass the callback to it
[23:18] jellosea: sure i can pass a callback to the function
[23:18] jellosea: that its supposed to call
[23:18] zomg: so you could have something like var testPasses = false; parsePacket(function() { testPasses = true; }); assertTrue(testPasses);
[23:18] zomg: Assuming it's synchronous.
[23:19] jellosea: zomg: well first of all the function call is triggered by me sending a udp packet
[23:19] zomg: Well yes obviously it won't work exactly like my example, but that is the basic premise :)
[23:19] Klaus_Dieter: hmm # /usr/local/bin/node
[23:19] Klaus_Dieter: Illegal instruction
[23:19] jellosea: yeah but..
[23:19] Klaus_Dieter: it built successfully
[23:19] jellosea: okay well are you saying to modify the fucntino it calls?
[23:19] tdubellz has joined the channel
[23:19] zomg: No I mean you give it a callback which marks the test as complete once it's called
[23:20] zomg: If it never gets called, then the test will never succeed
[23:21] Klaus_Dieter: this is the strace: http://pastebin.com/sKbWD7T7
[23:21] jellosea: zomg: well i can't specify a callback actually since im just sending a udp packet
[23:21] jellosea: in the packet i'm not specifiying a callback
[23:21] jellosea: receivePacket () { usePacket(param1, param2); }
[23:21] jellosea: that function will get called when i send a packet
[23:21] jellosea: and i want to make sure usepacket is called with param1 and param2
[23:22] ianl` has joined the channel
[23:22] zomg: Well what does usePacket do?
[23:22] jellosea: its a separate function call
[23:22] stalled has joined the channel
[23:22] jellosea: inside receivePacket it parses the packet and then calls usePacket with the right parameters
[23:22] bnoordhuis: Klaus_Dieter: can you hook it up to gdb and disassemble the offending function?
[23:22] Glenjamin has joined the channel
[23:22] jellosea: probably shouldnt be called usePacket since its not really using the packet
[23:23] bnoordhuis: it's probably a floating point opcode or some such that your cpu doesn't support
[23:23] zomg: jellosea: so what is the result of usePacket then? Does it call something else? Modify the state of the object?
[23:23] cjheath has joined the channel
[23:23] SuMarDi has joined the channel
[23:23] jellosea: not really.. it does some other complicated stuff i guess.. i can see where you are going such that you want to make sure that usepacket did is job
[23:23] zomg: If it's an internal function of the object under test, you probably should not test that it gets called, but rather than the result after processing/using the packet is the expected result
[23:24] jellosea: but i want to just verify that it gets called
[23:24] Klaus_Dieter: bnoordhuis: I am not sureProgram received signal SIGILL, Illegal instruction.
[23:24] Klaus_Dieter: 0x00263364 in v8::internal::ArmUsingHardFloatHelper() ()
[23:24] N0va` has joined the channel
[23:24] jellosea: is it possible just to verify it gets called?
[23:24] Klaus_Dieter: how is that ^ well my cpu does not have an FPU maybe that is why
[23:24] zomg: You probably could just replace it with a mocked function assuming it's accessible from the outside
[23:24] monokrom_ has joined the channel
[23:24] zomg: It's not a very ideal approach though in my opinion :)
[23:25] bnoordhuis: Klaus_Dieter: do you see 'fpu : yes' in /proc/cpuinfo?
[23:25] Klaus_Dieter: bnoordhuis: no - also I know it does not have an fpu
[23:25] skm has joined the channel
[23:26] bnoordhuis: Klaus_Dieter: okay, in that case you need to compile with -mfloat-abi=soft
[23:26] bnoordhuis: i.e. emulate floating point ops
[23:26] Klaus_Dieter: bnoordhuis:  so I just add that to CCflags?
[23:27] bnoordhuis: Klaus_Dieter: and CXXFLAGS
[23:27] Klaus_Dieter: allright

[23:28] knite: anyone here having trouble with lessc (command-line less)? latest version of less/node not producing output.
[23:29] jellosea: zomg: can you give me an example of how to replace it with a mocked function?
[23:29] Klaus_Dieter: bnoordhuis: well I do hope it is worth it and etherpad-lite will run on this arm box well.... the real deal for etherpad is using 50% cpu and 1GB ram even when idle...
[23:29] jellosea: i need to make sure that is the same function.. not a different function, since like if someone changes the code they aren't gonna change the mocked version most probably
[23:30] bnoordhuis: Klaus_Dieter: you can claim a lot of geek credit for it if nothing else
[23:31] zomg: jellosea: well, in your test you would just do something like obj.usePacket = function(foo, bar) { /* check args */ }
[23:31] Klaus_Dieter: bnoordhuis: even getting etherpad-full to run on that box was - well - interesting
[23:31] jellosea: zomg that works, thanks !

[23:34] tjholowaychuk: ah soda, nah hard to wrap stuff like that in an api that works for everything
[23:34] johnnywengluu: here you are writing it as chaining instead .. is there a lib for this or do you just make the API better
[23:34] tjholowaychuk: that was just specific to soda
[23:34] johnnywengluu: ok
