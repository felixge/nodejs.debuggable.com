[00:48] zodiak: RLa, urm, you kind of don't. A document database stores everything a single document needs all in one object/key
[00:48] zodiak: this leads to highly de-normalized databases (under NF theory)
[00:48] kriszyp has joined the channel
[00:49] zodiak: eg; you ~will~ have (say) 'user bob' in about 300+ places and all their information
[00:49] RLa: zodiak, let's say i have blog post and comments, how does one add comment
[00:50] RLa: don't you have overwrite everything just to get one item appended to some list?
[00:50] zodiak: RLa,  you would update the post. Normally most doc-db's have an 'append onto set' notation/call
[00:51] RLa: duh, i did not know
[00:51] zodiak: I mostly use cassandra .. so .. I can't speak to couchdb
[00:51] RLa: that would make a lot more sense than first pulling whole doc then doing small update, then writing it back

[02:47] mr_luc: I'm trying changing the package.json to see if npm's install succeeds now ... it'd be weird if latest node and latest npm from github didn't work together, so maybe it's interference from a previous version of npm :P
[02:48] context: mr_luc: well, npm is packaged with node now
[02:48] context: mr_luc: try using the npm that comes with 0.7pre, i imagine it will actually work
[02:48] context: mr_luc: any reason you are using 0.7pre ?

[02:48] mr_luc: nah -- it was just what was on gh

[03:43] teadict: ):
[03:43] mr_luc: yeah -- maybe you could google for projects on github that are built on express
[03:44] andrew12: the simplest way to figure out how to structure your app is to write it in one file and then find stuff that is related to each other
[03:44] andrew12: and move them out
[03:44] teadict: is this fair enough? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5778245/expressjs-how-to-structure-an-application
[03:45] andrew12: teadict: use that.
[03:46] teadict: although, that seems to only tear appart the main blocks of things
[03:46] teadict: it's not like a revolution
[03:46] andrew12: how?
[03:47] teadict: puts the routes there, the envs over there
[03:47] andrew12: isn't that what you want?
[03:47] teadict: mmm
[03:47] andrew12: it's laying it out like an MVC
[03:47] teadict: what if you have like 200 routes?
[03:47] andrew12: it's one file
[03:47] andrew12: o.0
[03:48] teadict: doesn't get messy?

[03:52] teadict: "Full MVC+H stack" what's that H?
[03:52] andrew12: nicholasf: it depends on what you want to do. if all of your code requires the libraries and stuff then not really. there's no performance hit that comes to mind either.
[03:52] nicholasf: andrew12: well, it's an intermediary step for me
[03:52] Dmitrijus: teadict: sorry for my rudeness, but it seems you're just spending too much time worrying about the minor details (which will be obvious), before actually writing the code :)

[04:03] Dmitrijus: teadict: oh, awesome! :)
[04:03] teadict: because of the concurrency
[04:03] andrew12: what kind of app, i mean?

[04:04] teadict: kind of stuff

[04:16] SirFunk: this is the freaking ugliest code i've ever written.. can someone take a quick look at this and see if there's any way i can clean it up? https://gist.github.com/fe5967098502747882d8  fwiw Table, Seat, Bill are all mongoose models
[04:16] context: holy lord.
[04:16] Dmitrijus: WTF
[04:17] context: i have a general rule. if a method extends past one page... get rid of it (1 page for me is ~ 40 lines)
[04:17] SirFunk: right?!
[04:17] context: sirfunk: split half those damn callbacks into seperate functions.
[04:18] andrew12: railway looks kind of cool. i'm going to play with it rather than structuring my code in really weird ways that feels and looks odd.
[04:19] SirFunk: hmm... there is some of it i'd like to push into the model layer, but i'm not really sure how to. My models are modules and if i could make the fire some of the socket.io stuff (like when they are saved or whatever) that would be cool, but i'm not sure how to pass the io object back to the module

[04:20] jellheen has joined the channel
[04:20] Dmitrijus: SirFunk: also, fix your identitation, it's just wrong (you can use whatever style guide)
[04:20] zodiak: max number of lines in a method/function should be 10. it's the maximum lines most humans can hold in their frontal cortex at any one time :D
[04:20] SirFunk: zodiak: i know
[04:20] SirFunk: i'm trying to figure out how to simplify it
[04:20] avih has joined the channel
[04:20] zodiak: also a =comment= or two on what is going on would be awesome :D
[04:20] SirFunk: most of my code isn't this ugly but the level of callbacks necessary to work with mongoose makes it stupid
[04:20] zodiak: not what you are doing, but +why+
[04:21] zodiak: never used mongoose :)
[04:21] Dmitrijus: SirFunk: also, if you use closures like function () {}, you can still name them, like function whatever () {}
[04:22] Dmitrijus: with no space between name and the ()
[04:22] Dmitrijus: my bad
[04:22] SirFunk: there's no way to do anything syncronious .... which gets ugly if you need to do something like Grab Record A, set value on A.foo to bar, add relation B to A, set value B.baz to freeeee .. that's like 6 levels of nesting.. so i turned to async
[04:22] gigafied has joined the channel
[04:23] SirFunk: Dmitrijus: true, that'll probably make it look a bit better
[04:24] context: sirfunk: so put that logic in its own file
[04:24] context: sirfunk: you have 4-5 distinct actions in what you just said
[04:25] context: sirfunk: so make 4-5 functions.
[04:25] Dmitrijus: yes
[04:25] context: and half that shit can prolly be ran at the same time
[04:26] context: oh i wish heroku had riak hosting. mongo looks like crap compared to.
[04:26] joshsmith has joined the channel
[04:26] Dmitrijus: context: hm, why do find mongo being crap? i like it 
[04:27] context: ive never really used it to be honest :x so i really shouldn't comment
[04:27] context: sirfunk: why arent all those actions being executed at the same time, and nested instead ?
[04:27] SirFunk: context: async.parallel does execute them at the same time
[04:28] SirFunk: i think all the ones that can happen at the same time i have in async.parallell.. some depend on others to complete though
[04:28] joshsmith: random, broad, computer science question: are there any good resources for learning (or re-learning) some of the basics that someone who's self-taught would've gotten in computer science undergrad but didn't?
[04:28] joshsmith: things like data structures and algos
[04:29] SirFunk: Dmitrijus: do you use an orm for mongo?
[04:30] Dmitrijus: SirFunk: NO
[04:30] context: dmitrijus: mongodb directly?
[04:30] Dmitrijus: yes
[04:30] Dmitrijus: well, to be honest, i never used mongodb from node, did a lot from python though :)
[04:31] SirFunk: ahh
[04:31] Dmitrijus: but using an orm here is kinda missing the point
[04:31] SirFunk: i use it a lot in rails and it's fine...
[04:31] SirFunk: yeah
[04:31] context: damn. mongodb hasn't been touched since april, 2010 thats kind of sad
[04:31] context: considering how much node has changed
[04:31] ep0x has joined the channel
[04:31] SirFunk: context: you mean the binary module?
[04:31] context: for node.
[04:32] andrew12: context: node is a lot newer though
[04:32] context: ahh node-mongodb-native is up to date
[04:32] context: but is it fast :/
[04:32] andrew12: oh, are you talking about the mongodb package or mongodb itself?
[04:32] SirFunk: context: https://github.com/christkv/node-mongodb-native  3 days ago?
[04:32] SirFunk: ahh he found it :-P
[04:33] andrew12: oh, that is the mongodb package...
[04:33] context: yeah i was looking at node-mongodb
[04:33] ryan_stevens has joined the channel
[04:33] andrew12: I always find the github pages by doing `npm home package`
[04:33] andrew12: opens it in my browser :p
[04:34] context: wow that just looks horrid
[04:34] context: i have to call client.bson_serializer.ObjectID(...) every time to fetch a record
[04:34] ep0x: what's the best way to learn node.js from scratch? Ive only done jquery in the past and when I look at the free guides on google it makes me want to hit myself
[04:34] andrew12: play with examples
[04:35] andrew12: or come up with some sort of project and work on it
[04:35] joshsmith: ugh, why is every algo/data structure book in Java or C(++)?
[04:35] andrew12: because nobody gives a shit about algorithms or data structure in any other language
[04:35] context: joshsmith: does the language really matter ?
[04:36] andrew12: that too
[04:36] gigafied has joined the channel
[04:36] context: as long as you can read it....
[04:36] andrew12: and knowing how to read C[++] and Java is a useful skill
[04:36] mr_luc: 'because of CS curriculum' ... curriculi? curricula?
[04:36] context: just be thankful its not OCaml or haskell.
[04:36] joshsmith: I'm not sure I can read Java; C(++) maybe
[04:36] dharmesh has joined the channel
[04:36] context: you wouldn't understand that stuff for shit
[04:37] andrew12: mr_luc: curriculum is plural
[04:37] mr_luc: oh ... yeah.
[04:37] andrew12: hehe
[04:37] mr_luc: so singular is .. 
[04:37] mr_luc: curricules!
[04:37] andrew12: curriculum
[04:37] joshsmith: I've never done much of a real coding interview before, so I'm looking at the book "Cracking the coding interview"
[04:37] mr_luc: dammit, english. y u no make sense.
[04:38] joshsmith: and he's going on about how no one knows algos anymore
[04:38] Dmitrijus: joshsmith: well, i do
[04:38] andrew12: fish and fishes, deer, etc
[04:38] andrew12: moose
[04:38] Dmitrijus: joshsmith: but other skills are just much more useful for software development
[04:39] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[04:39] context: joshsmith: the code interview is about actually knowing the language you are developing in
[04:39] joshsmith: I mean, I write working code. I test it. I can do continuous deployment, etc. etc.
[04:39] joshsmith: do I really need to know the most optimal sorting algo?
[04:40] Dmitrijus: joshsmith: it's mergesort
[04:40] Dmitrijus: end of story
[04:40] joshsmith: I guess it depends on what I'm doing
[04:40] context: hahahaha
[04:41] context: do you /really/ need to? depending on the job, yes.
[04:41] joshsmith: yeah, dumb question
[04:41] mr_luc: I think for most people, if you know when speed matters, when to spike into performance issues, that's probably a lot more important than being able to rattle off C99 details etc.
[04:42] context: joshsmith: and when i say really know the language, its about knowing the oddities and quirks of a language. and the little tricks to make life easier
[04:42] context: joshsmith: "i wrote a blog in node" doesn't mean you know node.
[04:43] joshsmith: sure. nor does writing an npm package or two
[04:44] joshsmith: ACTION is reading Node in Action atm

[05:08] SirFunk: I have 2 streams that both emit close events.. is there any way to fire a function when they are BOTH done?
[05:08] Outsider__ has joined the channel
[05:09] poincare101: SirFunk: write a callback for one of them, and then the callback has another callback inside it that waits for the other one.
[05:10] alessioalex has joined the channel
[05:10] SirFunk: hmm.. i'm not sure if that'll work
[05:10] SirFunk: i think the callback only gets fired when the stream actually ends.. so if the innerone ended first nothing would happen 
[05:10] poincare101: SirFunk: make both combinations, maybe?
[05:11] poincare101: one with the first stream being the inner, and the second with the first stream being the outer

[05:42] nicholasf: thelifelessone: sounds like you've made a mistake in your configuration
[05:42] nicholasf: what kind of debugging steps have you followed?
[05:43] thelifelessone: Google, console.log.
[05:43] nicholasf: how is Google a debugging technique?
[05:43] thelifelessone: search for similiar issues, and try the solutions

[05:45] nicholasf: is anyone working with socket.io here? Could they talk me through some basic concepts?
[05:45] thelifelessone: deoxxa: https://gist.github.com/1520586
[05:45] thelifelessone: not the best out there, I suppose, but I'm still learning the framework
[05:45] deoxxa: nicholasf: i use it pretty extensively at work, what's up?
[05:45] nicholasf: I'm finding it really difficult to code asynchronously to the web in the request response format in express
[05:46] nicholasf: deoxxa: well, Im just wondering if I add a socket layer then perhaps I don't have to be concerned so much about fighting to write code asynchronously that responds to the request cycle
[05:47] nicholasf: like, right now I'm writing some code that uses everyauth to integrate with facebook - creating the user or retrieving and existing record. This is done in the space of a http request starting from a backbone layer
[05:48] thelifelessone: Aaaand debugging isn't doing anything.
[05:48] nicholasf: I end up spending a lot of time in callbacks, etc., to ensure the response is the User object (either created from scratch or retrieved from redis). Perhaps I should just use socket.io to update the backbone app with the user when things are complete rather than fight through a difficult callback structure
[05:48] thelifelessone: There aren't any errors...
[05:48] deoxxa: thelifelessone: http://expressjs.com/guide.html#route-middleware
[05:49] nicholasf: thelifelessone: have you set up logging in express so it can at least tell you something
[05:49] nicholasf: ?
[05:49] thelifelessone: nicholasf: yes.
[05:49] thelifelessone: deoxxa: I have to build a route to server client-side resources?
[05:49] nicholasf: so can you see a 404 in the logs?
[05:49] deoxxa: thelifelessone: you do if you want to put it under /assets
[05:49] nicholasf: when you request a static resource?
[05:49] thelifelessone: nicholasf: I'm not getting any kind of errors.
[05:50] thelifelessone: like, none at all.
[05:50] Shaunzie: thelifelessone: the app.'s file is in a directory containing the assets directory?
[05:50] deoxxa: https://gist.github.com/1520586#L16 << this looks like you want it to be http://<something>/assets/<static files>
[05:50] thelifelessone: Shaunzie: The assets folder is one folder up from the app.js file.
[05:50] deoxxa: is that correct?
[05:50] thelifelessone: I think so?
[05:51] deoxxa: you think so?
[05:51] Shaunzie: move your asset directory into the same directory as app.js
[05:51] gkatsev: if it's one folder up, then shouldn't the url be '../assets'?
[05:51] thelifelessone: gkatsev: I tried that already, gkat.
[05:51] thelifelessone: -_-
[05:51] purr: thelifelessone: ಠ_ಠ is an IRC client/IRC client framework.
[05:51] gkatsev: thelifelessone: you probably need an absolute path.
[05:51] thelifelessone: thank you, purr, and you're infinite wisdom. Now go do bot stuff.
[05:52] gkatsev: thelifelessone: why is the assets folder one folder up? sounds like a weird folder structure
[05:52] thelifelessone: I'm weird like that.
[05:52] mr_luc: nicholasf -- not directly related, but if you're open to an option that just feels ... wrong, have you looked at now.js? it's a fun little layer on top of socket.io, I've been playing around w/it this past week
[05:52] gkatsev: thelifelessone: well, try doing it the other way
[05:52] nicholasf: ffs thelifelessone you havent even gisted your code
[05:52] nicholasf: youve just said - my code doesnt work
[05:52] deoxxa: thelifelessone: don't be weird for no reason. it results in problems like this.
[05:52] nicholasf: and asked people to guess what's wrong with it
[05:52] gkatsev: nicholasf: he has, actually.
[05:52] deoxxa: nicholasf: he did

[05:53] nicholasf: gkatsev deoxxa ok ok sry
[05:53] gkatsev: np
[05:53] deoxxa: thelifelessone: do you want the assets to live under /assets in your urls? or no?
[05:53] nicholasf: ok, but there's no logging configured
[05:53] thelifelessone: Yeah
[05:53] thelifelessone: I do.
[05:53] deoxxa: ok then, you're going to want to set up a route then

[05:56] thelifelessone: with the views?

[06:01] thelifelessone: gkatsev: how?
[06:01] nicholasf: mr_luc: now.js looks like fun

[13:22] Shaunzie: Sure
[13:22] sirwan: how would nodes differentiate between the multiple sites
[13:23] Shaunzie: You would just run each site off a different port
[13:23] Shaunzie: and then have nginx take care of proxing
[13:23] jetienne_ has joined the channel

[13:25] Industrial: sirwan: no, you don't need anything else then node
[13:25] Shaunzie: You don't have to use nginx, but you'll have to put something in front of the node process and proxy to port 80

[16:58] Niro_: I have no idea how that happened
[16:59] Niro_: anyway - I'm trying to implement a keepalive on a pretty basic webserver
[16:59] Niro_: I'm using .net to build it ant not http, so bear with me
[16:59] Niro_: (this is a homework assignment so everything is pretty raw and simple)
[17:00] FG has joined the channel
[17:00] Lingerance: .NET questions are better answered elsewhere
[17:00] Niro_: I've got my request/response js objects and I'm checking a keepalive 'flag' upon response.end() calls - if it's 'true' (i.e keepalive=true), I don't hit socket.end()
[17:00] cclarke has joined the channel
[17:00] Niro_: what I'm trying to figure out is if socket.setTimeout(keepalivetimeout) would do the trick for what Im trying to do
[17:01] juanlargo: qq for anyone out there building big web apps
[17:01] juanlargo: how are you managing your client-side code?
[17:01] juanlargo: requirejs?
[17:01] Niro_: client side is Chrome :)
[17:02] juanlargo: maybe i should get more specific and ask if anyone is using requirejs with express
[17:02] deoxxa: juanlargo: i use ender in a couple of projects, and a horrible home-grown system in a more enterprisey thing at work
[17:02] Niro_: what I mean is, I hit socket.setTimeout(30000) in my server-connection event, if a client (i.e, browser) re-using the same socket comes along, will it restart the timer
[17:02] Niro_: what's requrie js?
[17:03] juanlargo: deoxxa: do you share code between server and client, or is it just a system to keep the client side more modular?
[17:03] webben: Niro_: http://requirejs.org/
[17:03] deoxxa: juanlargo: i share code - templates and other presentation stuff mostly
[17:03] juanlargo: cool, would you recommend looking into ender?
[17:03] cclarke_ has joined the channel
[17:03] deoxxa: i would, it's quite nice to use
[17:04] deoxxa: http://ender.no.de/ if you hadn't already found it
[17:04] Niro_: webben, this is a debugging tool?
[17:04] webben: Niro_: No.
[17:04] Niro_: So waht is that?
[17:04] Niro_: I'm not allowed to use any external libraries :)
[17:04] juanlargo: Niro_: it's for managing your code in a modular fashion
[17:05] deoxxa: Niro_: it's unrelated to your question
[17:05] Niro_: Oh
[17:05] deoxxa: (there are people other than you in here)
[17:05] Niro_: I know, but he referenced me when he linked that.
[17:05] Niro_: So I asked.
[17:05] deoxxa: because you asked about it ._.
[17:05] deoxxa: ACTION is confused
[17:05] Niro_: Oh, hehe.
[17:06] Niro_: my bad.
[17:06] juanlargo: Anyways, I dig the commonJS approach and wanted to approximate that on the client side
[17:06] cclarke has joined the channel
[17:06] juanlargo: but have been reading that some folks aren't down with that as a long term solution
[17:06] webben: Niro_: You're not allowed to use any external libraries?
[17:07] juanlargo: so just thought i'd see if anyone in here had experience either way
[17:07] Niro_: No, as I said, this is a homework assignment for university.
[17:07] webben: ah ok
[17:07] Niro_: My question is pretty much, how would you write a keepalive mechanism.
[17:07] notifybot has joined the channel
[17:07] Niro_: When I open up chrome and log onto my sever, I get blasted by around 10 simultaneous connections, each getting its own socket.
[17:07] Niro_: Will any of those be re-used if I have keepalive on?
[17:08] deoxxa: juanlargo: well, there's some limitations with the require() approach - mainly that you can't inject stuff into the require()'d module
[17:08] deoxxa: not simply, anyway
[17:08] Niro_: I need to make sure they do. I was thinking about socket.setTimeout upon node.Server listening events.
[17:09] descipher has joined the channel
[17:09] deoxxa: Niro_: i don't quite get what node has to do with your .net server... can you explain how they're related?
[17:09] Niro_: my server is written in node.js? 
[17:09] Niro_: using the .net module
[17:09] AndreasMadsen has joined the channel
[17:09] Niro_: I noted that because most of the examples over the internet use the .http module.

[17:14] Niro_: doexxa, am I right in my assumption? if my server implements keepalive correctly, Chrome will reuse open sockets in its next reqeust from my server?
[17:17] deoxxa: Niro_: it's hard to tell - you might want to try curl
[17:17] FG has joined the channel
[17:17] deoxxa: Niro_: curl will definitely use a single connection and keepalive

[17:19] hugdubois has joined the channel
[17:19] Niro_: But am I right to assume that when I do 'socket.setTimeout(...)' each time a new socket is initiated - that if the browser reuses an old socket, the timer will be restarted?
[17:19] Niro_: i.e, is that the way net.Socket.setTimeout() works?
[17:20] Niro_: the whole reason i"m asking this is because socket.setKeepAlive doesn't seem to do what I need/want.
[17:20] r04r has joined the channel
[17:21] deoxxa: you won't get two separate connection events, you know that, right?

[17:21] omenkzz has joined the channel
[17:21] deoxxa: so long as you don't actually close the socket (and the client doesn't close it), it won't just be "cleaned up" or anything

[19:48] lmatteis: or generally what a stream is
[19:51] Pritchard has left the channel
[19:51] Pritchard has joined the channel
[19:51] isufy has joined the channel
[19:51] Pritchard: lmatteis:  Well, in general a stream is just a buffer of data.
[19:52] lmatteis: hrm ok
[19:52] teadict: streams are data, but they are streams because there's something watching that data going through
[19:52] lmatteis: what do you mean "something watching"
[19:52] lmatteis: like in C to do an http request i read "buffers" of data until the entire request length is read
[19:52] lmatteis: is that a stream?
[19:53] Pritchard: lmatteis:  Yeah.  I mean, C/C++ even uses the term stream.
[19:53] diminoten has joined the channel
[19:53] teadict: yes.. only there, you're just waiting for the data to go through
[19:53] teadict: sometimes, whatever is watching the data go through, is waiting for some pattern or someting
[19:53] lmatteis: what do you mean? can you give me an example?
[19:54] teadict: take a JSON string.. full of html tags
[19:54] teadict: you want to collect the img's
[19:54] teadict: you watch the stream of json and take the img
[19:54] Gregor has joined the channel
[19:55] teadict: and assign an event to that capturing of a img tag
[19:55] lmatteis: so "watching" is basically something that gets called (a callback) when a chunk of data is read?
[19:55] teadict: to add it to a list of images on the clietn side
[19:55] teadict: yes
[19:55] teadict: when a stream is analyzed
[19:55] teadict: and so on
[19:55] teadict: at least, that's what I understand...
[19:56] Renegade001 has joined the channel
[19:56] jsurfer has joined the channel
[19:56] Pritchard: lmatteis:  Just consider the bare minimal requirement of calling something a stream to be a buffer.
[19:57] lmatteis: i don't understand
[19:57] Pritchard: You seemed okay up until just a moment ago.
[19:57] Pritchard: What happened?
[19:57] teadict: forget about my silly example
[19:57] lmatteis: that last statement was referred to your phrase
[19:57] Pritchard: Okay.  I'll reword it.
[19:58] Pritchard: If you have a buffer, you may just have a stream, depending on context.
[19:58] Pritchard: The fact is, programmers throw (some) jargon around loosely.
[19:58] lmatteis: okay
[19:58] Pritchard: In rigorous models, a stream will be rigorously defined.  In more loose models, you might call something a "stream" just because of how it's used, or because "buffer" was already taken.
[19:58] teadict: buffer(stream(data))
[19:59] Pritchard: teadict:  Thanks.
[19:59] teadict: one contains the other
[19:59] Pritchard: But doesn't stream(buffer(data)) make more sense?
[19:59] teadict: I think I placed them in terms of functionality
[19:59] Pritchard: A buffer is just an array of data, a stream may have specifications as to how it should be formatted.
[19:59] teadict: a buffers does something with the stream
[19:59] teadict: a stream by itself is just data passing through
[20:00] teadict: but yes, could be too, there's only information!
[20:00] teadict: and we ruin it with tags ):
[20:00] Pritchard: Heh.
[20:01] Pritchard: What are you suggesting, that we come up with an unambiguous, tagless language?
[20:01] lmatteis: i thought the term stream was not referred to simple data but the flow of data
[20:01] teadict: I'm suggesting we need Telephaty like RIGHT NOW
[20:01] teadict: it's time already dammit
[20:01] macav has joined the channel
[20:01] Pritchard: lmatteis:  Well, streams can be thought of as coming from somewhere or going somewhere.
[20:01] teadict: *pathy
[20:01] Pritchard: In C/C++, you have input streams like stdin and stdout.
[20:01] skoom has joined the channel
[20:02] diminoten has joined the channel
[20:02] Pritchard: s/input streams/i\/o streams
[20:02] Pritchard: So yes.  The application matters.
[20:04] Pritchard: But ultimately, a stream is just a buffer of data, like anything else we do in computing.  We just have sets of data, with some kind of formatting specification, and we do something with that set.
[20:04] Pritchard: ... Sometimes I think the fundamentals of computing are lost in abstractions.
[20:04] lmatteis: so in context of Node?
[20:04] lmatteis: what's useful for me to know?
[20:04] Pritchard: lmatteis:  I think that if the term "stream" concerns you so much, you need to start building actual applications.
[20:05] Pritchard: Because this is a nuance.
[20:05] Pritchard: It's petty.
[20:05] lmatteis: it's not concerning me much
[20:05] lmatteis: however it popus in the Node api

[21:09] TheJH: NHQ, don't sudo the curl, sudo the sh
[21:09] TheJH: NHQ, you need root rights for installing, not for downloading
[21:09] daneroo: Anyone know a way to restrict/force dnode (over socket.io) to using xhr-polling (doesn't seem to fall back gracefully when deploying on cloudfoundry)
[21:09] NHQ: ooooooh
[21:10] NHQ: i mean, that is obvious ^__^
[21:10] TheJH: NHQ, don't worry, a lot of people ran into that before :D

[21:12] daneroo: Any on used dnode on cloudfoundry (node.js) ?
[21:13] TheJH: NHQ, you mean, you didn't append the `| sudo sh`?
[21:13] NHQ: correct
[21:13] NHQ: should I have?
[21:13] TheJH: yes
[21:13] TheJH: !@NHQ mem npm-install
[21:13] jhbot: NHQ, you can install npm by doing "curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh". If you don't feel comfortable piping data from http in a sudo'ed shell (which really isn't a good idea), you can also download it, look at it and then pipe it in the shell.

[21:50] sirwan: anyone know if centOS is worth installing over ubuntu for Nginx and NodeJS ?
