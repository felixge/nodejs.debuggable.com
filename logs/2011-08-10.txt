[03:04] PawnStar: hi all.  i'm trying to write a server that sends custom headers, but i'm stuck.  the problem is that only morons use Node.js, and i'm not a moron.  can anyone help?
[03:05] bnoordhuis: PawnStar: trolling?
[03:05] PawnStar: huh?
[03:05] Nexxy: lol
[03:05] Nexxy: I think he means mormon
[03:05] tjholowaychuk: only mormons use node?

[03:06] tim_smart has joined the channel
[03:07] mdz has joined the channel
[03:07] Borgoluzzuo: So yeah, that didn't work -- I think the emit is going out to the *clients* but I need it to just fire the server event.
[03:07] PawnStar: can anyone help
[03:08] Nexxy: PawnStar, what kind of header are you trying to write?
[03:09] emmanuel: Borgoluzzuo: what are you trying to do ?
[03:09] PawnStar: am i qualified to use Node.js
[03:09] eliziario has joined the channel

[03:10] Borgoluzzuo: So I'm using socket.io to listen for a whole bunch of different events.  And in some instances and I want to call those events server-side -- which I cannot figure out what to do.
[03:10] Nexxy: PawnStar, you may not be enough of a moron to be honest
[03:10] Nexxy: PawnStar, are you trying to write http headers?
[03:10] emmanuel: how about socket.on('YourEvent', function(){ spmeEvent.emit('plop
[03:10] emmanuel: fuck
[03:11] emmanuel: how about socket.on('YourEvent', function(){ someEvent.emit('plop') });
[03:11] Borgoluzzuo: Let me write out a gist of what I'm trying to do.
[03:11] Borgoluzzuo: might make more sense
[03:11] PawnStar: wait, MORMONS
[03:11] PawnStar: only MORMONS
[03:12] Nexxy: PawnStar, that's what I thought :)

[03:15] djbell has joined the channel
[03:16] emmanuel: Borgoluzzuo: did you try socket.emit('bye') ?
[03:16] tjholowaychuk: Borgoluzzuo it's the only way
[03:16] mrryanjohnston: emmanuel: that'll send it to the client.
[03:16] djbell: is there anything I have to require to get process.on('SIGTERM',...) to trigger when I hit control-C ?
[03:16] djbell: tried googling for it, no luck
[03:17] Borgoluzzuo: Blast -- so I'd have to send to the client -- which would then send back to the server?  That seems so unnecessary. 
[03:17] mrryanjohnston: djbell: isn't that shell specific
[03:17] tjholowaychuk: djbell sigint
[03:17] djbell: k, thanks

[03:18] jellosea: why am i getting this error? CALL_NON_FUNCTION_AS_CONSTRUCTOR
[03:19] Nexxy: cuz you're trying to call something that's not a function... as a constructor ;o
[03:19] jellosea: well clearly thats not really the case
[03:19] Nexxy: chances are somethign is not what you think it is
[03:19] emmanuel: Borgoluzzuo: I'm not sure I understand what you want to do , but it looks like a misuse of events
[03:19] Nexxy: jellosea, my first question is; are you using coffeescript?
[03:20] jellosea: Nexxy: no
[03:20] Borgoluzzuo: emmanuel: I have multiple node processes and want to trigger events which come in through a pub/sub over redis.  So for example, node process 1 receives a command, then pushes it over redis to its buddies, and its buddies can act on it as well.
[03:20] PawnStar has left the channel
[03:20] Nexxy: some context would make it a lot easier to help
[03:22] jellosea: well the constructor im triyng to call has a constructor in the file, has module.exports = ClassName ; at the bottom
[03:22] jellosea: like what are the other reasons that error msg is outputted other than the oe its stating
[03:23] emmanuel: so you have sockets between your node processes ?
[03:23] Nexxy: I've only encountered that error once myself
[03:23] Nexxy: and it was approriate
[03:24] Borgoluzzuo: emmanuel: Yup -- different processes have different sockets.
[03:24] Borgoluzzuo: emmanuel: And the processes communicate over redis.
[03:25] dominictarr has joined the channel
[03:25] emmanuel: but it's a different socket for talking with redis than with the client
[03:25] Borgoluzzuo: emmanuel: Correct.
[03:25] emmanuel: basically, you want to emit/write 'bye' to redis, and have redis emit/write 
[03:25] emmanuel: 'bye' to all other instances
[03:26] Borgoluzzuo: yes!
[03:26] odie5533: I need to walk a directory.
[03:26] emmanuel: then your snippet seems alright, just emit 'bye' to the proper socket 
[03:27] Borgoluzzuo: emmanuel: The processes aren't connected via sockets though -- merely over redis.
[03:27] seivan has joined the channel
[03:28] Borgoluzzuo: I feel like this should be way more trivial than it actually is.  Like, all I want to do is call a function -- is it really that difficult to do?
[03:29] emmanuel: everybody is connected to redis, right ?
[03:29] odie5533: not me
[03:29] emmanuel: you want one to talk to redis, and redis to broadcast to everybody
[03:29] Borgoluzzuo: emmanuel: Right.
[03:30] emmanuel: then I assume you need sockets between all nodes and the redis
[03:30] Nexxy: as long as your other nodes are subscribed, it shouldn't be an issue
[03:30] Borgoluzzuo: They are subscribed
[03:30] Borgoluzzuo: so I have them subscribed and listening for data
[03:30] Nexxy: ACTION scrolls up
[03:30] Borgoluzzuo: and i want to take that data
[03:31] Borgoluzzuo: and have it fire an event, so a listener can do its thing
[03:31] Borgoluzzuo: but calling an event server-side is apparently impossible?

[03:33] Borgoluzzuo: I don't believe that, but let me read up on it.
[03:33] Nexxy: lol k
[03:34] Nexxy: it seems quite trivial to me but maybe I'm misunderstanding something
[03:34] Borgoluzzuo: It *can't* be this difficult to just fire an event.
[03:34] Borgoluzzuo: How is there not something like Event.fire(method, data)
[03:35] Borgoluzzuo: like, I'm doing the equivalent of $('#element').click() in jquery
[03:35] Borgoluzzuo: or at least trying to.

[03:54] Nexxy: what's the point of authentication if everything is sent in plaintext anyway?

[03:55] Nexxy: not at all
[03:56] Nexxy: also ftr facebook has an ssl option
[03:56] astropirate: true

[03:57] Nexxy: but anything that's supposed to be private?
[03:57] astropirate: not so much as private but personalized
[03:57] Nexxy: then why not just use a cookie
[03:57] Nexxy: and save your users the pain of having yet another username/password to remember
[03:58] astropirate: it was an example
[03:58] Nexxy: or better yet use oath!
[03:58] boehm has joined the channel

[04:17] mrryanjohnston: i'm having issues with mongoose/possible mongodb. I have a model with { count: {type: [Number], default: 0} }; The type is an array because I'm using mongoose-auth and that's the only way it'll work for now; I only store a single number and would otherwise do type: Number. Anywho, I do something like `instance.wins[0]++; instance.save(function(err) { });`, but this increment is not actually saved

[04:21] tmzt: yea, sorry
[04:21] bazookatooth: but everyone seems to use mongoose, and i assumed there was a good reason for that

[05:55] garrensmith: davidbanham: It might be that your spacing is wrong. Is there anything before the p?
[05:55] Borgoluzzuo: It is seemingly impossible without "proxying" through the client -- which I want to avoid.
[05:56] Borgoluzzuo: I thought i could do socket.fireEvent("bye") -- but sadly, negative.
[05:56] garrensmith: Borgoluzzuo: you going to have to wrap that up in another class with its own events that you can fire...
[05:56] davidbanham: garrensmith: There is, but I think my spacing is okay. This is the whole fragment - https://gist.github.com/1136219
[05:57] garrensmith: else you need to seperate the function that gets called on bye and call it on 'hi'
[05:57] Borgoluzzuo: garrensmith: I'm using socket.io -- I believe it is part of the socker_server class, no?  Are you aware of how to accomplish this in the context of socket.io -- if at all?

[06:04] astropirate: abraxas, aye aye moin capiton
[06:05] garrensmith: Borgoluzzuo: if you read the socket.io code you would most likely find out where the server socket and be able to call it, but then you are depending on the internals
[06:05] abraxas: By the way, how do you guys 'n girls (if at all) jslint your code? What package and what configuration do you use? I'm playing with nodelint now, but the config seems incomplete..
[06:05] Borgoluzzuo: garrensmith: Right, but for each potential function to call, I'd have to wrap it out into its own function.  As it would occur once for each client coming in, and whenever events came in server side as well.
[06:06] Borgoluzzuo: garrensmith: That's true.  I was investigating the fireEvent method -- I'm just not familiar with js/node to know much about it -- it is available to any object upon instantiation?
[06:06] ronniebo_ has joined the channel
[06:06] garrensmith: Borgoluzzuo: I think it depends on your use case. I've never heard of the fireEvent what is it?

[06:09] odie5533: How do I keep node running?
[06:09] Borgoluzzuo: garrensmith: Appreciate the help, btw.
[06:09] odie5533: It seems to close before my callbacks are done.
[06:09] garrensmith: Borgoluzzuo: I'm sure .emit is what you are looking for
[06:09] garrensmith: Borgoluzzuo: no prob. Good lucj
[06:10] garrensmith: *luck
[06:10] Borgoluzzuo: garrensmith: The problem is that .emit emits to all *clients*
[06:10] Borgoluzzuo: whereas I want it to just call the local function.
[06:10] Borgoluzzuo: errr event
[06:10] mosen: util.inherit replaces the whole prototype right? so do most people then augment the prototype by setting each property?
[06:10] davidbanham: odie5533: It closes as soon as it doesn't have any more jobs to do.
[06:10] garrensmith: Borgoluzzuo: you must create your own event
[06:11] Borgoluzzuo: garrensmith: Hm, I'm unaware of how to do that -- I'll investigate.

[06:18] davidbanham: abraxas: I don't actually use either of them, so I'm afraid I can't be of much help. It's just a package I remembered seeing and it seems to be under more active development than the jslint package.
[06:18] abraxas: I'm looking for a way to enforce curly brace logic... thought jshint/lint could help there.
[06:19] abraxas: I love all the other checks it does, but this one check seems to be missing.. a bit unfortunate.

[06:53] jetienne: random123: using async ? :)
[06:54] garrensmith: Borgoluzzuo: you might be able to do socket.$emit.apply('bye', [stuff]);
[06:54] random123: jetienne: Once problem is if you use an Async function, you will never return to that scope again right? So you must continue passing callbacks for the rest of the program?
[06:54] jetienne: random123: out of curiosity, async lib is ok for browser ?
[06:54] jetienne: random123: do you have an url on the async lib with 800 followers ?
[06:54] Borgoluzzuo: garrensmith: That's essentially what I'm trying now, but it isn't quite working.  I'm doing it on the .sockets namespace so: socket_server.sockets.$emit.apply('bye', ['1']);
[06:55] Borgoluzzuo: It still isn't catching it...
[06:55] random123: jetienne: I have seen it but it is quite ugly to be spreading all that across an entire program
[06:55] garrensmith: Borgoluzzuo: if you do console.dir(socket_ser.sockets) do you see the $emit function?
[06:55] Borgoluzzuo: let me check

[06:57] jetienne: random123: nice it is browser too
[06:57] garrensmith: Borgoluzzuo: what error
[06:57] Borgoluzzuo: TypeError: Function.prototype.apply: Arguments list has wrong type
[06:57] Borgoluzzuo: Which tells me it knows that its calling that $emit function.
[06:58] deadman87 has joined the channel
[06:58] Borgoluzzuo: garrensmith: I do not see the $emit function on socket_server either.
[06:59] jetienne: random123: clearly not the same scope as gowiththeflow.js tho. async.js is 600l gotwiththeflow.js is 20l
[06:59] garrensmith: Borgoluzzuo: I dont think it knows its calling that it just doesn't like it.
[06:59] jetienne: random123: async provide much more. some considere it good, some considere it bad. i am in the second group :)
[07:00] Borgoluzzuo: garrensmith: Right, so I just had to put the second param in array form and it "works" in that it is not failing, but isn't actually being picked up by the listener.
[07:00] garrensmith: Borgoluzzuo: I wrote this a while ago but it might help https://github.com/garrensmith/BuildMachine it uses socket-io for client communication and then its own events to talk to the server objects. Check server.js

[07:04] garrensmith: jetienne: Yeah I'm not so good with that stuff either
[07:04] Borgoluzzuo: garrensmith: I'm currently trying to build a system that connects multiple node processes together over redis.  So when one event occurs on one process, it shoots the event/data over redis to the other processes to run on their own sockets as well.  Thus, I just have a pub/sub on each node process waiting to execute the commands with the proper data.  All that doesn't work is this dang emit stuff.

[07:10] tmzt: does it have a redis client or something?

[08:34] random123: AvianFlu, why? I am asking sincerly
[08:35] SubStack: I think the idea of tamejs could be implemented a little more cleanly
[08:36] random123: SubStack: It does seem to help OkCupid a lot, they are worth 100 million
[08:36] random123: SubStack: They say they couldn't handle all the async code they do with out it
[08:36] Nuck: tamejs DOES look nice
[08:36] Nuck: I'll give it that
[08:36] AvianFlu: basically they wrote their own weird control flow lib because they don't know js, and there's some wonky js parsing involved
[08:37] Nexxy: it looks hacky
[08:37] Nexxy: extremely hacky
[08:37] Nuck: IT does
[08:37] eldios has joined the channel
[08:37] Nuck: But it looks better than CS
[08:37] Nexxy: dear god
[08:37] Nuck: Even if it is extremely hacky
[08:37] Nexxy: you can't compare everything to cs, nuba 
[08:37] Nexxy: nuck*
[08:37] SubStack: random123: there are other ways to manage nested callbacks
[08:37] random123: Well, I tested it out and it runs half as slow as using a different lib
[08:37] AvianFlu: like naming and chaining them!
[08:37] random123: I think their c++ implimentation must be better
[08:37] SubStack: yep
[08:38] Nuck: Or, ya know, just USING CALLBACKS
[08:38] andrewfff has joined the channel
[08:38] Nuck: I find the simplest solution is usually the best
[08:38] Nuck: Therefore using callbacks is perfect ;)
[08:38] random123: How about GoWithTheFlow? any praise for that?
[08:38] jetienne: :)
[08:38] SubStack: or building nice interfaces
[08:38] jetienne: rai
[08:38] AvianFlu: how to not nest callbacks: https://gist.github.com/1131154
[08:38] jetienne: random123: i heard the author is super cool :)
[08:39] Nuck: jetienneGonna take a wild guess, say it's you?
[08:39] jetienne: Nuck: i, not the only cool guy on the planet, am i ? :)
[08:40] Nuck: jetienne: Just sounded like a shameless self-bump there :P
[08:40] jetienne: Nuck: i least i stopped the tamejs rambling which was starting ;)
[08:40] random123: jetienne, I think your solution is the best out of all
[08:41] jetienne: random123: to say the least :)
[08:41] bergie has joined the channel
[08:42] random123: Well, I will forget TameJS and Stratified, also CoffeeScript, I don't really like things that need to be compiled into JS very much at all at this point

[08:44] zilch: When running a express.js using forever.js , one of our services went down  ... but strangely forever could recover it after a long 15 minute gap ..
[08:44] random123: Now maybe someday I could figure out how the hell those 20 lines work
[08:45] zilch: what could be the reason that forever couldn't start it immediately ?
[08:45] jetienne: random123: dig the git you will find longer version ofthe source. much easier to understand
[08:45] jetienne: zilch: it smell like network issue. like a bound port so the server could not be restarted. wild guessing here
[08:45] random123: jetienne: Cool
[08:46] Nuck: Fuck, Jonathan's Card was viral marketing?  Gotta hand it to Starbucks, that's a badass trick.
[08:46] jetienne: Nuck: yep i disliked it too. they lied and this is not cool
[08:47] Nuck: jetienne: You could get free coffee from it, quitcher bitchin
[08:47] davidbanham has joined the channel
[08:47] jetienne: Nuck: i think you misunderstood it
[08:48] jetienne: the free was other people money
[08:48] jetienne: give a penny, leave a penny kindof stuff
[08:49] Nuck: I know, that was the goal
[08:49] zilch: jetienne, oh ... my service ( give it name ServiceX ) is express.js based HTTPS server listening on port 30105, and I have node-proxy (listening on 443 ) which redirects to this service X whenever a request is matched aginst the path
[08:49] Nuck: I'm talking about the nasty reality
[08:49] mc_greeny has joined the channel
[08:49] zilch: i have other such 3 services running on port 30101, 30102 and 30103 ...
[08:50] zilch: they are all https ... 
[08:50] Nuck: jetienne: Also, it's take a penny, leave a penny.  Give a penny, leave a penny implies that you're giving money 24/7
[08:50] zilch: It is all there on ec2 ... and whenever any of this service is down .. I can't even do SSH ...
[08:50] jetienne: zilch:  i was talking about tcp port binding. like impossible to listen until a timeout
[08:52] Mansoor_s: abraxas, here is my node development setup http://mansoorsayed.com/2011/08/10/gnome3-javascript-developement-setup/
[08:52] zilch: jetienne, so you mean to say that port 30105 ( in this case )  was occupied even after crash ... making a restart by forever impossible ?
[08:52] jetienne: zilch: exactly, this is my guess at least
[08:52] Mansoor_s: zilch, what OS are you on?
[08:52] zilch: but , how could it possibly effect my ability ssh ?
[08:53] jetienne: zilch: next time it happen do a netstat. it will tell you if my guess is correct or not
[08:53] jetienne: Mansoor_s: macos why do you ask
[08:53] zilch: Mansoor_s, I am on Ubuntu made for ec2
[08:53] zilch: i am using free tier
[08:53] jetienne: zilch: it is irrelevant to ssh access

[09:17] Nuck: ACTION slaps SubStack for using sync.
[09:17] abraxas: Mansoor_s: thanks, I'll have a look!
[09:17] SubStack: require is sync

[09:59] Nuck: That's like typing in JS

[10:24] tuhoojabotti: Nuck: You're not helping either.

[12:14] farhadi: icebox: thanks, So I think I should create a new buffer and then copy the contents over to the new one
[12:14] TheJH: farhadi, correct
[12:14] zilch has joined the channel
[12:14] postwait has joined the channel
[12:14] farhadi: TheJH thanks
[12:14] bnoordhuis: farhadi: is the new buffer bigger or smaller? in the second case, you can .slice() it
[12:14] DrPizza_: odie5533: so either build from the master branch, or wait for 0.5.4
[12:15] icebox: farhadi: correct... http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.10/api/buffers.html#buffer.copy
[12:15] odie5533: DrPizza_: just built the master. Seems to be working! :)
[12:15] farhadi: bnoordhuis: no the new one is bigger
[12:15] DrPizza_: odie5533: good good
[12:15] bnoordhuis: farhadi: okay, .copy() it is then :)

[12:17] farhadi: So how to free up memory used by the old buffer?
[12:18] DrPizza: odie5533: however there are some other fixes around win32 process spawning that don't look to have been merged into master yet
[12:19] odie5533: hmm. I guess I can only hope I don't run into them then
[12:19] DrPizza: odie5533: if you want to use custom environments, don't
[12:19] DrPizza: the fixes are made to libuv, but haven't been merged into node yet.
[12:21] odie5533: Why is libuv work done in libuv instead of in the node repo?
[12:21] DrPizza: because libuv is useful in its own right
[12:21] DrPizza: it makes sense for its development to be separate

[16:38] icebox: Hello... I have been trying to call a socket write in a data event handler, but I get an error: Socket is not writable ... Any idea?
[16:38] CoverSlide: from the browser?
[16:39] CoverSlide: icebox: perhaps the socket is closed?

[16:41] icebox: Generally speaking, is it possible to make a write in the data event handler?

[16:41] klovadis: that should not be a problem in general
[16:41] icebox: klovadis: ok...
[16:41] klovadis: reading and writing are two different streams afaik
[16:42] icebox: klovadis: I think it is not a race condition because I tried to call mysocket.write... in the debugger and I get the same error
[16:44] klovadis: icebox: it does sound as if there is another problem concerning your socket, not related to the data sending. try and get a stripped down version working with some dummy data beforehand
[16:44] CoverSlide: icebox: are you trying to write from an asynchronous call?
[16:44] wookiehangover has joined the channel

[19:56] tjholowaychuk: for something that could easily be automated
[19:56] jesusabdullah: I think the question is, why would somebody do configuration through environment vars?

[23:27] tech2: isaacs: thanks, will try
[23:28] TheJH: blub_, I'm nearly sure that's not the case
[23:28] TheJH: blub_, could you install "iftop" and then run "sudo iftop -i eth0" or so? It's like top, but for network
[23:29] AvianFlu: blub_: if you don't like seeing it hang with no output, I recommend `npm config set loglevel info`.  You may have other issues, but that one gives you more output to look at.
[23:29] AvianFlu: in the case of slow internet, I vastly prefer it to nothing
[23:29] TheJH: blub_, then look whether there's 50.16.186.4 somewhere

[23:30] tech2: isaacs: is there a way I can use npm locally, assuming I can download things by other means?

[23:32] tech2: looks like it's trying to reach https://registry.npmjs.org/nopt
[23:33] jyu322 has left the channel
[23:33] isaacs: TheJH: it's exploring a tree in parallel
[23:33] blub_: okay i turned on logging, found the URL of the tar file, wgetted it and installed it with npm install tarfile
[23:33] blub_: all good, thanks
[23:33] mosen has joined the channel
[23:33] isaacs: blub_: are you behind a proxy or something?
[23:34] blub_: something like that. using ec2
[23:34] TheJH: isaacs, so the progress may decrease or so, right? there are other programs that behave that way, too
[23:34] blub_: so it is restrictive about incoming traffic
[23:34] towski has joined the channel
[23:35] TheJH: isaacs, also, you could first show exploration progress (one more dot per fetched file or so) and then download progress
[23:36] isaacs: TheJH: yeah, the point is, it's a bit more tricky than just `curl -#` stye bar when it's downloading stuff.
[23:36] TheJH: mhm...
[23:36] isaacs: TheJH: i mean, it *could* be done, and would benice.

[23:39] TheJH: isaacs, wow, npm install over http is a lot faster than over https
[23:40] TheJH: isaacs, another feature idea: store file hashes in the registry, download files over http and then verify them using the metadata fetched via https

[23:52] isaacs: TheJH: yeah, a mixed http/https plan would be good.
[23:52] CStumph has joined the channel
[23:53] isaacs: TheJH: originally, if the registry was https, it'd still use http for tarballs.
[23:53] isaacs: TheJH: however, if what you want is to force auth, and never expose your code to the wild internet (ie,if it's some internal registry) then that doesn't work so well.  but that could be a config or something.
[23:53] TheJH: hmm, yes, right
[23:54] isaacs: TheJH: it already does verify shasums against what's in the registry metadata
[23:54] mynyml has joined the channel
[23:54] isaacs: TheJH: now that couch sends a Content-MD5 header, i can also check that
[23:55] isaacs: TheJH: then you'll have validation (checking against the https metadata) as well as corruption detection (checking against the advertised md5)
[23:55] TheJH: isaacs, so it would be sufficient to add some parameter for "always-https" and to make the tarball download protocol depend on that?
[23:55] isaacs: TheJH: yeah, probably.
[23:55] isaacs: TheJH: but that'd fall down if you had a registry that is actually only https

[23:56] TheJH: isaacs, how about setting the default for "https for tarball" to "only if the registry was set manually"?
[23:56] hippich has joined the channel
[23:57] isaacs: hrm.  that seems wrong...
[23:57] TheJH: :D
[23:57] isaacs: TheJH: or we can just require that if you're using an https-only registry, you have to set --always-https

[23:58] TheJH: isaacs, people who don't know about this change might complain that it should be all-https by default for private registries
[23:58] jtsnow has joined the channel
[23:59] isaacs: TheJH: then they should make their registries not respond on :80
[23:59] Nexxy: osnap
[23:59] isaacs: TheJH: they'll complain about getting 404s
[23:59] isaacs: TheJH: and then we can tell them to set always-https :)
[23:59] TheJH: isaacs, mmhm, ok
