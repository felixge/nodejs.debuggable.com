[00:00] gen: since it's all single threaded
[00:00] isaacs: industrial: ie, it's easier to miss one at the end of every line, when every other line has one, but easier to spot a lone ( or [, if those are not allowed, at the start of the line.  starts of lines are more visible, and oft-repeated tokens are harder to spot when they're missing, because you become numb to them
[00:00] isaacs: gen: they wait.
[00:00] isaacs: gen: use the child_process to run long-running CPU-bound tasks in a separate process

[00:01] isaacs: gen: in practice, such tasks are rare, and not really node's strong suit anyway.  it's best for IO-intensive tasks, where you're normally io-bound

[01:03] Eber: question... why this line? aren't exports and module.exports the same object? "exports = module.exports = connect.middleware;"
[01:03] mape: hmm, using request, "The third is the response body buffer." does it really return a buffer? seems more like a strong
[01:03] mape: *string
[01:04] wadey: Eber if you reassign one of them, then they aren't any more
[01:04] wadey: they start off being the same though
[01:04] Eber: wadey: but to prevent that, you just need to define one of them, or not?
[01:04] konobi: exports is a reference to module.exports, but exports is scope limited to the module
[01:05] Bonuspunk has joined the channel
[01:05] wadey: yeah, so just doing exports = connect.middleware won't work
[01:05] wadey: doing just module.exports = connect.middleware works
[01:06] wadey: but then you lose the shortcut of using "exports" in the rest of the file
[01:06] wadey: that is why that line is doing both
[01:06] Eber: uhmm, that was going to be my next question :)

[01:42] isaacs: they're enumerated first, and in numeric order.
[01:42] davidbanham has joined the channel
[01:42] odie5533: How far along is Windows support for compiling addon c++ modules?
[01:42] isaacs: bnoordhuis: instead of enumerating in the order in which they're added
[01:42] bnoordhuis: odie5533: absent
[01:43] bnoordhuis: odie5533: or non-existing
[01:43] odie5533: right now sure, but I read in a blog comment it was being worked on.
[01:43] bnoordhuis: isaacs: okay, but is that an issue with module loading?
[01:43] odie5533: What are the priorities currently for Windows support?
[01:43] bnoordhuis: isaacs: or would a file.json be preempted by file.1?
[01:44] bnoordhuis: odie5533: first priority: get node itself working
[01:44] isaacs: bnoordhuis: yes, "file.0" will come before "file.js"
[01:44] isaacs: bnoordhuis: but only if you have a require.extensions["0"] function
[01:44] isaacs: bnoordhuis: which *would* be really odd
[01:44] odie5533: bnoordhuis: can you be a bit more specific? :)
[01:44] bnoordhuis: isaacs: right, talk about an unlikely corner case
[01:44] isaacs: bnoordhuis: that seems to be what i'm good at :)
[01:45] bnoordhuis: odie5533: we're working on porting node to windows
[01:45] bnoordhuis: odie5533: once that's stable, we'll set up some kind of build farm that produces pre-compiled binaries
[01:45] isaacs: bnoordhuis: but also, i've kind of had it out for extensionless module loading forever.
[01:45] bnoordhuis: odie5533: the two can run in tandem of course but porting has prio 1
[01:45] bnoordhuis: isaacs: hah, why?
[01:46] isaacs: i fought against it being added to the commonjs spec, and then i resisted it going into node, and then managed to sneak back in the *ability* to put extensions in the require() call.
[01:46] odie5533: bnoordhuis: sorry, I meant to ask what were the priorities within the porting effort at this point
[01:46] isaacs: bnoordhuis: it's unnatural!  if you want a file, you shoudl specify the filename.
[01:46] bnoordhuis: isaacs: windows disagrees with you

[01:49] bnoordhuis: let's just wait until the first bug report comes in :)
[01:50] isaacs: bnoordhuis: shigeki's patch reserves js, node, and json as the first extensions to be searched, always.
[01:50] isaacs: bnoordhuis: but numeric keys still trump everything else.
[01:50] isaacs: let's just document it, and go back to not caring.

[01:52] bnoordhuis: too much will break if we change that
[01:52] isaacs: sure, but i mean, we can just document that if you add a numeric extension, that'll cause odd behavior.

[02:38] micheil: chapel: there's sorta of some stuff that's opensource from us, we will be releasing more stuff soon though
[02:38] chapel: cool
[02:38] chapel: just was curious
[02:38] micheil: chapel: currently our open-source projects mainly relate to ruby (em-hiredis, em-websocket)
[02:38] chapel: having internal support is one thing
[02:38] chapel: yeah
[02:38] chapel: is the full stack ruby, or do you use node there too?
[02:38] micheil: and we'll be releasing a testing framework for javascript soon, called cognac
[02:39] micheil: (I'm going to be talking at London JS #4 about this on the 15th of August)

[02:41] Nican_ has joined the channel
[02:42] chapel: testling looks promising
[02:42] kavla: and the hard parts are really boring
[02:42] tjholowaychuk: i think the key thing is that no test framework suites all problems even remotely
[02:42] towski has joined the channel
[02:43] kavla: I think that in general is one of the biggest issues in the node universe
[02:43] kavla: generally
[02:43] tjholowaychuk: my latest test frameworks consist of like 8 lines of bash
[02:43] tjholowaychuk: yay
[02:43] kavla: that is; the patterns have not yet full emerged and there are so many ways to skin a cat it's hard to build tooling
[02:43] kavla: hehehe
[02:43] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[02:44] chapel: build your own
[02:44] chapel: thats all that matters
[02:44] tjholowaychuk: they are just different too. testing cluster is different than stylus, stylus different than some app, some app different than express
[02:44] guillermo has joined the channel
[02:44] chapel: different apps have different approaches
[02:44] temp01 has joined the channel

[02:54] kavla: your framework is actually pretty good for my needs on the backend
[02:54] kavla: could use a cleaner sync/async system
[02:54] kavla: and I didn't look deeply but it seemed to be missing setup and teardown for async
[02:54] tjholowaychuk: expresso?
[02:54] kavla: yep
[02:55] tjholowaychuk: yeah it was not really designed for testing apps
[02:55] tjholowaychuk: i never really intended on that to be honest haha
[02:55] rabidsnail: How do I create a domain socket pair in node? There doesn't seem to be an equivalent to socketpair()
[02:56] rabidsnail: Calling createConnection on a new path raises ENOENT
[02:56] kavla: It's still pretty solid for it, and using async tests to simulate multiple users interacting works pretty well
[02:56] kavla: The one that really makes me sad is Zombie

[09:25] rurufufuss has joined the channel
[09:25] fille: but i can use the nuhup command?
[09:25] fille: nohup*
[09:25] mscdex: for non-ubuntu you'd probably use /etc/init.d/
[09:26] fille: but the script wont work ?
[09:27] mscdex: init.d scripts are different than upstart
[09:28] fille: i guess i need to read then
[09:29] mscdex: fille: here's a gist of an init.d script for running a node service from someone who commented on that article: https://gist.github.com/715255
[09:29] mscdex: fwiw
[09:29] TheJH: fille, which debian version?

[09:43] mscdex: ok, it looks like there's a package for upstart in debian 6
[09:43] mscdex: so you could `apt-get install upstart` and see how that works
[09:44] mscdex: otherwise use that init.d script i'd say

[09:50] mscdex: TheJH: i dunno, i just did `dpkg --get-selections | grep upstart` and got nothing on a fresh debian 6 vm
[09:50] mscdex: TheJH: and there's no /etc/init/
[09:50] TheJH: mscdex, but it's also no classical init
[09:50] dhaivat: Hi everyone. I'm thinking of an idea of a node.js for lua. Same thing, same idea, same async stuff, same function pointers, just with luajit.
[09:51] mscdex: TheJH: right, it's not. sysvinit scripts are in /etc/init.d/, upstart scripts are in /etc/init/
[09:52] mscdex: i have to do `apt-get install upstart` to get it install on fresh debian 6, which gives the prompt fille is talking about
[09:53] fille: hrm...
[09:53] TheJH: mscdex, what do the headers of the files in /etc/init.d look like?
[09:53] mscdex: TheJH: sysvinit script headers :-)
[09:54] mscdex: fille: maybe you could try upgrading to upstart  in a vm first if you want to make sure it won't do anything crazy?

[10:38] jacobolus has joined the channel
[10:38] SubStack: TheJH: and much more fanciness than just that, but I'll let that be a pleasant surprise once it goes live
[10:39] mscdex: Twelve-60: you just call it on the instance. if ObjToInheritFrom or any of its parents have a function called 'foo', you'll have access to that on instances of MyObj
[10:39] TheJH: SubStack, :)
[10:39] SubStack: so once that comes out nobody will have an excuse for not writing browser unit tests
[10:39] mscdex: Twelve-60: just make sure you call .inherits() before you start adding to the object's prototype though
[10:40] Twelve-60: mscdex: but say you override it, can you call the parents from within (e.g. override the constructor with extra functionality and then call the basic parents contructor)
[10:40] Twelve-60: e.g. this.super() in java/classical
[10:40] mscdex: Twelve-60: yes, you actually have to do that manually iirc in js. it doesn't call the parent constructor automatically
[10:41] Twelve-60: mscdex: fair enough, any idea how? :D or something to read on it
[10:42] jacobolus has joined the channel

Doing this from client to server I can avoid this by slicing the relevant data in a packet to client and directly sending it to server. I'm able to avoid copying the buffer by using buffer.slice. Is there any way to avoid memory copying when sending data with headers back to client?
[11:03] ryah: japj: put it in the configurations -> Debug section

[11:41] madsleejensen: Hi all, im trying to create a 20 byte binary representation of a hex string, but when i do buffer.toString('binary') it encodes some of the bytes into "\u0004" values which mean my output buffer will end up longer than expected
[11:41] odie5533: .toString(16)
[11:42] madsleejensen: for example: hex: 3d496af676894143463d5517b4d91f184964f068 will output "=IjÃ¶vÂ‰ACF=U\u0017Â´Ã™\u001f\u0018IdÃ°h"
[11:42] odie5533: hmm, what kind of buffer are you using?
[11:42] hippich has joined the channel
[11:42] hippich has joined the channel
[11:42] madsleejensen: new Buffer('hexnumber', 'hex');
[11:43] madsleejensen: and if i then do buffer.toString('binary') it adds those unicode or whatever values they are :)
[11:45] madsleejensen: maybe you cant create a 20 char "text" representation of a 20byte value without those \u0000 values
[11:46] odie5533: That doesn't explain the funny characters.

[12:51] TheJH: hello S1r10n
[12:51] S1r10n: I have trouble retrieving remote_user with node... I can't find anything like basic auth for node
[12:51] TheJH: S1r10n, uhm, what is remote_user?
[12:52] S1r10n: if you type user:password@url the part before the @
[12:52] S1r10n: I dumped the whole req of my http connection but can't find a match
[12:54] TheJH: S1r10n, it's in the headers
[12:54] TheJH: S1r10n, look for "basic http auth" or so on english wikipedia
[12:54] S1r10n: I have  the logged headers right in front of me
[12:55] TheJH: S1r10n, do they contain "Authorization"?
[12:55] S1r10n: so node is definitely capable and it is really just that I need to require them or smth?
[12:55] bradleymeck: Authorization should be set
[12:55] bradleymeck: ive used it
[12:55] bradleymeck: what version of node?
[12:55] S1r10n: 0.5.4-pre
[12:56] S1r10n: cloned git about 4 days ago
[12:56] TheJH: S1r10n, can you see a "Authorization" header?
[12:56] bradleymeck: ACTION goes to pull it master
[12:56] S1r10n: no
[12:56] brolin has joined the channel
[12:56] TheJH: S1r10n, maybe your browser only sends that header after he got a "HTTP/1.1 401 Authorization Required" response with "WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Secure Area"" or so
[12:57] S1r10n: maybe I just need to "reuire" them... ?
[12:57] S1r10n: hm...

[13:07] S1r10n: hmmmmm you are right it works using curl just not with chrome (and firefox, for a different reason)
[13:09] TheJH: S1r10n, you have to tell the browser: "No, you DON'T get this without authorization, just send me your password"
[13:10] S1r10n: yeah I'm at it just need some time to check the header syntax of node
[13:10] S1r10n: wether to send it in the firsst writeHeader or not...
[13:11] bradleymeck: S1r10n chrome seems to be stripping them, you have to do the WWW-Authenticate before it will let it happen (and you get a dumb popup)
[13:11] TheJH: S1r10n, there's only one call to writeHeader per response
[13:11] S1r10n: yeah

[13:22] bradleymeck: jarek you looking for the DOM or just the text?
[13:22] aruns: how is node.js using v8 ? is it as a library, or is node.js code a customized version of v8 ?
[13:23] bradleymeck: aruns using statically linked lib in standard install
[13:23] jarek: if there is this link in head section: "<link rel='icon'>blah</link>" then I would like to retrieve the "blah" text
[13:24] metaverse: How can I print info about a caught exception? For example, if I try this: try{ } catch(ex){ console.log(ex); } I get output: {}
[13:24] jarek: so I guess it would be enough for me to have just plain text (I can search the value with regExps)
[13:24] markwubben has joined the channel
[13:24] bradleymeck: jarek node.io or spider, that requires a full xml parse and selectors, avoid regexp with xml, html comments / nesting can f it up
[13:25] japj: jarek: you want to parse the html?
[13:25] bradleymeck: metaverse, are you looking for the stack trace? ex.stack
[13:25] japj: jarek: I think you can use jsdom with jquery for that
[13:25] aruns: bradleymeck, thanks. so it implements its own js interpreter with its api on top of v8 ?
[13:25] jarek: japj: but parsing the whole document is going to be slow, right?
[13:26] metaverse: bradleymeck: Thanks :)
[13:26] jarek: is it possible to download just the <head> section?
[13:26] gerard0 has joined the channel
[13:27] bradleymeck: aruns nope, just bootstraps stuff inside of v8, with some c++ bindings
[13:27] bradleymeck: jarek nope
[13:27] japj: jarek: I dont think so
[13:27] Metal3d has joined the channel
[13:27] bradleymeck: jarek if you want you could look into some sax parsing, which would be a little tougher but still pretty workable
[13:28] jarek: I think I will just implement this thing on the client side
[13:28] jarek: and then send the path to server with websockets
[13:29] aruns: thanks bradleymeck
[13:31] S1r10n has joined the channel
[13:31] aruns: well it looks like what i wanted to customize v8 for is already in node.js. i somehow got the impression that node.js only had server side io - sockets etc. didn't realize they have such an extensive api
[13:33] matyr_ has joined the channel
[13:34] S1r10n: well I was wrong it's the same deal with php ... and it works :D
[13:35] bradleymeck: so you get the authorization in php but not in node when using chrome?
[13:37] S1r10n: no I was wrong on php it sends a 401 first too and chrome dosnt send it without getting 401 first either

[16:08] TheJH: dan84a, hmm... does "/usr/local/bin/npm -v" work?
[16:08] FM: newy: can you assist how to run server file on brunch. should $node server.js
[16:08] dan84a: TheJH,nope, i grepped find npm and its no where on the system
[16:09] newy: FM: use "brunch watch" instead.  you don't start the server directly
[16:10] TheJH: dan84a, https://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/doc/removing-npm.md , section "More Severe Uninstalling" could help
[16:11] FM: newy: i've already 'brunch watch .' . but when tried to run $ node server.js.. it cant file modules (e.g: express). tried to npm install express inside brunch folder, but failed
[16:11] TheJH: dan84a, which OS/distribution are you using?
[16:12] dan84a: Debian 6.0 and running through those commands didn't help
[16:12] dan84a: sorry deb 5.0
[16:12] newy: FM: ok if brunch watch works, then run brunch build.  it will generate a html file in /build.  you just open it in browser.
[16:12] TheJH: dan84a, is that etch or squeeze?
[16:12] dan84a: etch

[16:14] tylergillies: can't remember exact name
[16:15] TheJH: dan84a, maybe you have to reinstall node or so? I really have no idea, but maybe it helps. I remember successfully running npm on squeeze, but that was 0.2.something
[16:15] FM: newy: owh, by it's mean that i dont have to run node to start the app?
[16:15] dan84a: i have tried removing node using make uninstall

[16:18] TheJH: dan84a, maybe you have to update to squeeze?
[16:18] dan84a: possible, altho this is a production server
[16:18] TheJH: dan84a, aww :(
[16:19] dan84a: maybe i should retry installing the older version of everything

[16:22] TheJH: bradleymeck, what do you want that for?
[16:22] dan84a: i see what the problem is, node isn't looking in node_modules
[16:22] tmzt_ has joined the channel
[16:23] dan84a: of the running directory
[16:23] bradleymeck: messing around w/ type tracing still

[16:23] Xano has joined the channel
[16:23] TheJH: dan84a, node >= 0.4 does that
[16:23] dan84a: i just tried 0.3 of npm and semvar can't be found and thats in the node_modules folder
[16:24] dan84a: there isn't a reason why it might not do that?

[16:27] bradleymeck: mmm im not seeing it, but maybe i need to do something w/ the parse function...
[16:27] TheJH: bradleymeck, you need to patch "walk" to copy properties, I think
[16:28] TheJH: bradleymeck, every walk destroys attached stuff by default
[16:28] bradleymeck: ugg

[16:56] MooGoo: as with many other nodejs modules
[16:56] tprice: my version is "v0.5.3-pre" should it not be a pre version?

[20:42] Anton_: intensively
[20:42] Anton_: it works fine
[20:43] Anton_: but when i artificially throttle nginx
[20:43] Anton_: those undestroyed objects appear
[20:43] Anton_: i see them throug profile
[20:43] Anton_: heap snapshot
[20:43] Anton_: https://gist.github.com/1129725
[20:44] Anton_: that's the code I used
[20:44] Anton_: to reproduce
[20:45] bnoordhuis: Anton_: that's the client end of the test case?
[20:45] Anton_: bnoordhuis: so, you understood the idea of test?
[20:45] Anton_: the other end is nginx
[20:45] Anton_: which serves index.html
[20:46] bnoordhuis: Anton_: to recap: you have a node.js script that fetches a static file served by nginx
[20:46] Anton_: yep
[20:46] bnoordhuis: and the script eventually fails with an out of memory error?
[20:46] Anton_: 1 test - let nginx work in full speed
[20:46] Anton_: 2 test - artificially slow nginx
[20:46] Anton_: yes, in 2nd case node fails with segdault
[20:46] Anton_: _segfault
[20:47] bnoordhuis: Anton_: this was on i386 linux right? what version of node?
[20:47] Anton_: any version of node
[20:47] Anton_: x32 and x64
[20:47] Anton_: i've tested 0.4.10, 0.5.2, 0.5.3, 0.5.4-pre
[20:47] bnoordhuis: and how long does it take?
[20:48] dev_ has joined the channel
[20:48] dev_: hi
[20:48] Anton_: I think it takes about an hour

[20:50] Anton_: limit_req_zone  $binary_remote_addr  zone=one:10m   rate=47r/s;
[20:50] Anton_: and in server/location zone 'limit_req zone=one burst=49;'
[20:51] Anton_: that was enough to see how the amount of garbage objects starts to grow

[20:52] mikeal has joined the channel

[20:52] dguttman has joined the channel
[20:53] bnoordhuis: Anton_: no, a backlog of pending requests
[20:53] Anton_: ah, yes
[20:53] Anton_: so some request get longer to be served
[20:54] bnoordhuis: Anton_: do you know if nginx accepts the extra connections?
[20:54] bnoordhuis: i suppose it should or you'd run into the os's backlog limit
[20:54] Anton_: no
[20:54] bnoordhuis: Anton_: no as in 'nginx rejects them'?
[20:54] xandrews has joined the channel
[20:55] Anton_: hm, I don't think I completely understand you :)
[20:55] markdaws has joined the channel
[20:55] Anton_: we just send request to nginx, it serves them very fast
[20:55] Anton_: but then we say nginx 'slow down buddy, not so fast'
[20:55] bnoordhuis: Anton_: think i found the answer: The directive specifies the zone (zone) and the maximum possible bursts of requests (burst). If the rate exceeds the demands outlined in the zone, the request is delayed, so that queries are processed at a given speed. Excess requests are delayed until their number does not exceed a specified number of bursts. In this case the request is completed the code "Service unavailable" (503). By d
[20:55] bnoordhuis: efault, the burst is zero. 
[20:55] Anton_: and some request get served longer
[20:56] Anton_: ye, i've set burst to 49
[20:56] Anton_: i didn't dig in it, I just got it working :)
[20:56] Anton_: and it shows the problem
[20:57] Anton_: nginx is just a technicality, you can use whatever you want
[20:57] Anton_: node part is what important
[20:57] bnoordhuis: right, but i need to understand what nginx does with the incoming requests
[20:57] Tacoman has joined the channel
[20:58] Anton_: some request don't get to be served as fast as it was in the first test case
[20:58] Anton_: bnoordhuis: it's pretty obvious when you look in the profile

[20:59] Anton_: but I think you know how to use node-inspector&v8-profiler? :)

[21:39] dail: guys i know is not a node.js questions but what linux distro do you advice me? with graphical interface (gnome or kde) 
[21:40] theCole: i use ubuntu or debian

[21:43] TheJH: dail, I'm currently using fedora - newer software (e.g. gnome 3), but the x driver fails every few days
[21:43] chjj: dail: theyre different things
[21:44] chjj: openbox is a window manager, kde is a desktop environment
[21:44] TheJH: theCole, just do a http request when the interval fires?
[21:44] chjj: personally, i dont use any kind of desktop environment, i just install openbox and then get whatever i need on top of that
[21:45] theCole: TheJH: i created a function called "fetchMedia" and i do call that when the interval fires

[23:31] ^robertj: bnoordhuis, how does a subprocesses' overhead compare to a new context's overhead?
[23:31] bnoordhuis: ^robertj: well... do you want a blanket statement?
[23:32] ^robertj: yeah
[23:32] bksf has joined the channel
[23:32] bnoordhuis: contexts are faster
[23:32] bnoordhuis: so if you spin up a lot of short-running scripts you'd go with contexts
[23:33] bksf: hey everyone, i have an outdated version of some express/node/dropbox code. i've gotten the example to stop throwing errors by updating to the current language api. one thing i cant find is this line is throwing an error no method getMetaData : ...req.session.db.getMetadata(req.params[1] || '', function (err, metadata) {
[23:34] smtlaissezfaire has joined the channel
[23:35] blueadept: would anyone know why this code cannot assign a value property to a text area? http://pastie.org/private/n8uwjzqngtugmd7cara
[23:35] ^robertj: bnoordhuis, that sounds right. But if the context goes memory-crazy how do I kill it?

[23:36] bnoordhuis: ^robertj: you can't currently so that's when you'd use child_process.fork()
[23:37] ^robertj: bnoordhuis, any way to put a debug hook in?
[23:37] bksf: anyone on the getMetaData session error?
[23:37] blueadept: wait nevermind
[23:37] blueadept: i got it
[23:38] mynyml has joined the channel
[23:38] bnoordhuis: ^robertj: you mean in a context?
[23:38] ^robertj: bnoordhuis, yeah
[23:38] bnoordhuis: ^robertj: not in any way that a clever script couldn't circumvent
[23:38] odie5533: When searching for node.js apis on google it returns results for old versions of node. Perhaps a single directory for the most current api should exist, and the older versions be kept as is but given a rel="canonical" link in their head tag?

[23:41] jonaslund: odie5533: i think you should file it as an bug report with the info

[23:42] odie5533: https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/941
[23:42] odie5533: someone already brought it up.
[23:42] isaacs: ^robertj Check out burrito or bunker, from SubStack.
[23:43] isaacs: ^robertj: You can inject a little checker function at every point that will throw if the time is up.  it's not cheap, though.  you may be better off just using a child process and killing it
[23:43] blueadept: anyone know of a good form validator that works with jade?
[23:44] dgathright has joined the channel
[23:44] bksf: anyone on the replacement i guess this is deprecated? req.session.db.getMetadata
[23:46] ^robertj: isaacs, won't the injected checker never be reached bya  blocking function?
[23:46] R4md4c: How can I stop needless request from a browser like the "/favicon.ico" request that come from Chrome ? Do I use regex to trap unwanted urls? or is there a better way ?
[23:47] zemanel has joined the channel
[23:48] jonaslund: R4md4c: well if you actually serve the file it'd be cached
[23:49] jonaslund: (yeah not ideal but.. :P )
[23:49] jonaslund: it appears that chrome doesn't even use favicon
[23:49] jonaslund: FF does though
[23:50] R4md4c: jonaslund, No I don't serve any files :) I just receive requests with a specific url expression that changes with the change of the requested method
