[00:41] lukegalea: EyePulp: On my osx laptop it's offset from GMT properly, on the server it's UTC because the server is set to use UTC for the system clock (or at least that's my guess)..
[00:41] mscdex: EyePulp: lukegalea: (new Date()).toLocaleString()
[00:41] tjholowaychuk: ryah: np, I can patch for 0.2.x as well if you want

[00:41] ryah: tjholowaychuk: sure
[00:41] EyePulp: lukegalea: interesting
[00:41] lukegalea: mscdex: I found I had to keep track of the client's offset, the server's offset and the database's offset and convert back and forth.

[01:54] tjholowaychuk: its all optional thanks to that architecture
[01:54] bingomanatee: Hey SubStack - got Flash plugins for Browserling.com?
[01:55] tjholowaychuk: squeeks: by default stdout/stderr are used, then logger() sets master.customFds to [-1, -1] so you can redirect to other streams
[01:55] tjholowaychuk: take a look at the logger() plugin's implementation if you need reference
[01:56] SubStack: bingomanatee: what?
[01:56] bingomanatee: On your virtual machine browsers - have you loaded the Flash plugin?
[01:56] SubStack: socket.io does something with it
[01:56] squeeks: tjholowaychuk: tl;dr I want to be able to output syslog compliant messages, not the ones that log puts out
[01:56] bingomanatee: I was showing my boss his home page on Browserling.com - not seeing flash playing. 
[01:56] squeeks: preferably RFC5424.

[01:57] jesusabdullah: In the past, the flash plugins weren't installed on the VMs
[01:57] pkrumins: right
[01:57] jesusabdullah: Ah
[01:57] tjholowaychuk: squeeks: yeah that is fine, like i said you can do whatever you want
[01:57] pkrumins: flash as a vm
[01:57] jesusabdullah: Why doesn't flash work on ec2?
[01:58] bingomanatee: You might want to think about that - people who like X-platform testing browsers are likely to depend on having flash on the page. 
[01:58] bingomanatee: esp. ad people.
[01:58] pkrumins: custom ec2 windowses with some crazy patches
[01:58] aurynn: tjholowaychuk, Found a typo

[04:12] piscisaureus: especially check if it doesn't break openssl on linux
[04:12] ryah: piscisaureus: hm
[04:12] piscisaureus: I take that as a no?
[04:13] ryah: piscisaureus: is it necessary to have both an include path and a lib path?
[04:13] ryah: or are you just following the convention?
[04:13] piscisaureus: ryah: following convention basically
[04:14] piscisaureus: ryah: although people may try to "install" openssl on windows and then the includes location is not fixed relative to the lib

[07:01] sholmes: Could someone help me test out this app on cygwin. I'm using cygwin and it's not working, Idk if that's because I'm using cygwin
[07:02] tmzt: chapel: it's async problem like every other time
[07:02] chapel: ah
[07:02] tmzt: though how it's possible for console to work I don't know
[07:02] chapel: hmm, so if you stringify it before sending it, does it work?
[07:02] tmzt: I moved the callbacks where they were supposed to be in the actaul function (I didn't gist that)
[07:03] tmzt: hold on
[07:04] sholmes: why not run npm as root?
[07:05] chapel: sholmes: because that means any module could run as root
[07:05] bronson has joined the channel
[07:05] SubStack: marcello3d: what are doing with canvas?
[07:05] chapel: modules when you install them can run scripts to install
[07:05] sholmes: how can I view a list of installed modules?
[07:05] chapel: so if you run as root, someone could just have a script that rm -rf / in it
[07:06] chapel: npm ls installed
[07:06] sholmes: okay, so I already installed express as root
[07:06] sholmes: does that mean anything in express can run as root?
[07:07] sholmes: root is the only user account on my VPS.

[07:10] tmzt: for the interactive one (which you want)
[07:12] tmzt: chapel: sweet, it's working ,try test@test.tld
[07:12] sholmes: can I just do useradd -m username -p mypass and the rest will be "autofilled"?
[07:12] chapel: cool tmzt
[07:13] tmzt: sholmes: that won't even create the home directory and has the nice side effect of dumping the password in your history
[07:13] sholmes: or must I specify -d -G -s and -g params?

[07:35] isaacs: chapel, sholmes: no, installing express as root doesn't mean that express can run as root later on. but installing anything as root means that (prior to npm 0.3.0) it can run any of its install/etc scripts as root.
[07:36] chapel: isaacs: well I was basing it off of what you had said before
[07:37] chapel: I didn't know what was coming down the pipe
[07:37] isaacs: chapel: suresure
[07:37] isaacs: chapel: you were mostly right :)
[07:37] chapel: best not to install as root anyways
[07:37] isaacs: chapel: in npm 0.3.0, using root is recommended.
[07:37] chapel: oh?
[07:37] isaacs: chapel: because it allows npm to run scripts as "nobody"
[07:37] chapel: ah, thats good
[07:37] isaacs: which is significantly safer than running them as your user account
[07:38] isaacs: so, root/.npm/foo/1.2.3/package will be owned by "nobody"
[07:38] chapel: cant wait
[07:38] chapel: eta?
[07:38] isaacs: but anything else will be owned by root
[07:38] isaacs: chapel: this week.
[07:38] chapel: sweet
[07:38] chapel: I had my first experience putting up a module on npm
[07:38] chapel: was simple and easy
[07:38] isaacs: great :)
[07:38] chapel: so thank you for it
[07:38] isaacs: bug reports are nice, but so are "it worked" reports
[07:38] chapel: heh

[08:44] chapel: hmm
[08:44] chapel: how does it handle coffeescript SubStack ?
[08:44] SubStack: if it finds a .coffee file, then it compiles it to javascript
[08:44] SubStack: check out the first example on the readme
[08:44] mr_daniel has joined the channel
[08:46] chapel: you just mean it compiles it on the fly before sending it?
[08:46] SubStack: no, it compiles it when you fire up the server
[08:46] pietern has joined the channel
[08:46] SubStack: everything gets compiled into /browserify.js or whatever
[08:48] chapel: oh
[08:48] chapel: sweet
[08:49] chapel: could you use that in tandem with dnode?
[08:49] foobarfighter: mikeal: yt?
[08:49] SubStack: chapel: working on that
[08:49] SubStack: I also want to get socket.io working with it so dnode can just require('socketio')

[08:53] foobarfighter: is it just client side require()?
[08:53] SubStack: yes but done correctly
[08:53] SubStack: none of this xhr crap
[08:54] SubStack: and it gets compiled at runtime when the server starts up
[08:54] SubStack: and you can include coffee script files now and it just figures out how to make that work
[08:54] SubStack: and it includes es5-shim for browsers that suck
[08:55] SubStack: oh right and you can use npm modules from the browser too
[08:55] foobarfighter: so this is done server side?
[08:55] SubStack: and it bundles npm module dependencies recursively too
[08:55] SubStack: yes all server-side
[08:56] foobarfighter: so you run some node server parses the JS for requires?
[08:56] SubStack: no
[08:58] weepy has joined the channel
[08:58] foobarfighter: does the require do some xhr call that bundles the dependencies?
[08:58] foobarfighter: and the evals them or something?
[08:58] foobarfighter: how does it wokr
[08:58] foobarfighter: work*
[08:58] weepy: anyone know what the roadmap for node v0.5.0 is ?
[08:59] SubStack: foobarfighter: 08:53:46 < SubStack> none of this xhr crap
[08:59] SubStack: it just bundles them
[08:59] SubStack: damn I don't even understand why anyone would use xhr for this
[08:59] foobarfighter: SubStack: im just having a hard time understanding how this thing helps me
[09:00] foobarfighter: the docs show some code examples
[09:00] SubStack: it's really simple: it takes all of your javascript and bundles it up in /browserify.js
[09:00] SubStack: and then you can do require()
[09:00] foobarfighter: ok.... so the browserify.js is special
[09:00] aklt has joined the channel
[09:00] SubStack: yes
[09:00] foobarfighter: its not the browserify api
[09:00] foobarfighter: i see
[09:01] foobarfighter: and what does it do?  wraps stuff in a functional scope?
[09:01] SubStack: yes pretty much
[09:01] SubStack: and it sets module.exports and exports
[09:01] polyrhythmic has joined the channel
[09:01] foobarfighter: ok... are you familiar with sprockets?
[09:01] SubStack: and defines a require() in module scope that is smart about directories so you can require('./foo') or require('../bar')
[09:02] foobarfighter: i see
[09:02] foobarfighter: interesting approach
[09:02] chapel: its all about not duplicating code
[09:02] chapel: SubStack really is making the ssjs dream a reality
[09:02] foobarfighter: but you have to know what your dependencies are ahead of time right?
[09:03] foobarfighter: for the client i mean
[09:03] SubStack: yes
[09:03] foobarfighter: sounds like the beginning of a pretty sweet loader :)
[09:03] SubStack: so you just pass require : [ 'traverse' ] or whatever when you call the middleware constructor
[09:03] skm has joined the channel
[09:03] mmso has joined the channel
[09:04] foobarfighter: but it would be cool if the browserify.js file knew what dependencies you needed on the page somehow
[09:04] SubStack: next I think I'll have it support package.json for dependency management
[09:04] SubStack: foobarfighter: that's too hard
[09:04] foobarfighter: :)
[09:04] SubStack: just minify it
[09:04] chapel: SubStack: imagine having it work with dnode, where you could do a require, and a lot of the stuff would be serverside
[09:04] SubStack: bandwidth is cheap
[09:05] foobarfighter: we have weird requirements
[09:05] foobarfighter: gotcha
[09:05] SubStack: well you can sort of do that right now by having different mount points
[09:06] foobarfighter: SubStack: dig your website
[09:06] mraleph has joined the channel
[09:06] jetienne has joined the channel
[09:07] SubStack: actually doing dependency analysis in not computable in all cases
[09:07] SubStack: because require() is just a function and you can call it from anywhere
[09:07] Qbix2:  what's new in the latest Node.js?
[09:07] Qbix2: is the api stable yet?
[09:08] SubStack: and you can't do much static analysis because it's freaking javascript
[09:09] foobarfighter: SubStack: you know of anybody/projects trying to load deps via synchronous json-p in functional scope?
[09:09] SubStack: ew gross
[09:09] Qbix2: what is the point of browserify.js ?
[09:09] SubStack: and I can't think of anything
[09:10] Qbix2: foobarfighter: what do you mean
[09:10] SubStack: Qbix2: so I can require() in client-side code
[09:10] Qbix2: oh, I see
[09:10] SubStack: and also so I can use my npm modules on the client-side
[09:10] Qbix2: are you trying to build some sort of transparency layer beteen node.js and browsers?
[09:10] Qbix2: wait isn't dnode already like that?
[09:10] Qbix2: "just use javascript and dnode no matter where you are"?
[09:11] SubStack: I don't want to make an rpc call for stuff like object traversal
[09:11] Qbix2: well if you just want to make something like node's require()
[09:11] foobarfighter: well... im working on a project.  i need to implement require on the client
[09:11] SubStack: you can't even do some stuff cleanly like what seq does because dnode mandates continuation-passing style
[09:11] Qbix2: then you'd have to use xhr and then manipulate the stuff you get back and eval that
[09:12] Qbix2: because you'd have to wrap what you get back in an anonymous function
[09:12] SubStack: false
[09:12] Qbix2: well, or you can use the server of course, to do it for ya
[09:12] SubStack: why does everybody think you have to use xhr‽
[09:12] Qbix2: substack: because most people think it's either <script> or xhr
[09:12] Qbix2: and script will have side effects
[09:12] Qbix2: like putting global variables
[09:12] Qbix2: into your scope
[09:12] SubStack: also false
[09:12] SubStack: you can wrap around that
[09:13] Qbix2: which part
[09:13] SubStack: scoping
[09:13] Qbix2: in browsers, <script> tags load everything into the global scope
[09:13] sechrist_ has joined the channel
[09:13] Qbix2: unlike in node.js
[09:13] Qbix2: don't they?
[09:13] SubStack: yes but
[09:13] SubStack: you can fix that
[09:13] Qbix2: how?
[09:13] SubStack: Qbix2: just look at the examples
[09:14] Qbix2: look at my framework: http://qbix.com/plugins/Q/js/Q.js
[09:14] Qbix2: Q.load is sorta what you're talking about
[09:14] SubStack: and this https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/blob/master/wrappers/body.js 
[09:14] Qbix2: what examples?
[09:14] SubStack: I don't like lazy loading, I want it all bundled
[09:15] adambeynon: SubStack: can browserify be used standalone instead of as the server middleware? All the examples use a server
[09:15] SubStack: adambeynon: not yet
[09:15] Qbix2: SubStack: it sounds like you are doing this on the server side
[09:15] foobarfighter: Qbix2: im thinking approach that uses script with server-side help would work best.  there will be a server anyway
[09:15] foobarfighter: for my stuff
[09:15] SubStack: Qbix2: yes everything is on the server side
[09:15] Qbix2: foobarfighter: well if you want to use the server, that's fine but eep in mind youc an't use a CDN if the script your' serving is dynamic
[09:15] SubStack: where it should be
[09:15] Qbix2: SubStack: well shouldn't the user decide where it should be :P
[09:16] Qbix2: I mean the developer
[09:16] SubStack: no
[09:16] SubStack: the user is wrong
[09:16] Qbix2: why?
[09:16] foobarfighter: CDN isnt needed.. its a yet another test framework
[09:16] Qbix2: Wait, wait... what are you trying to solve in the first place?
[09:16] SubStack: Qbix2: I want to require() in my client-side code and I want to require() some of my npm modules
[09:17] SubStack: that is what this lets me do
[09:17] andrewff1 has joined the channel
[09:17] Qbix2: oh I see.
[09:17] Ezku\: SubStack: i'm not up to par with my dependency management fu, how's browserify different from, say, requirejs?
[09:17] Qbix2: well in that case, sure. But why can't you just preprocess them with a script?
[09:17] SubStack: and I bundle everything server-side at runtime on server initialization because that way is more robust than xhr and won't lock up the page with synchronous ajax
[09:17] nmtmason has joined the channel
[09:17] Qbix2: and dump the result as .js files onto a CDN
[09:17] sholmes: I've been spending hours trying to figure out why I can't SSH as a new user I created. I need to do this so that I can npm install things not as root.
[09:17] Qbix2: no I agree about synchronous ajax
[09:18] Qbix2: although to be honest I prefer loading scripts asynchronously
[09:18] SubStack: Ezku\: requirejs makes you write asynchronous requires
[09:18] SubStack: which I hate
[09:18] Qbix2: because I don't like leaving it up to the browser. I have seen lots of horror studies on the internet
[09:18] SubStack: browserify does require() the nodejs way
[09:18] Qbix2: about browsers loading pages with scripts in them
[09:18] foobarfighter: Qbix2: preprocessing is an option but i dont like it
[09:18] Qbix2: when you see those waterfalls you always see crap (especially in IE)
[09:18] foobarfighter: Qbix2: im not sure if u are talking to me :)
[09:18] Qbix2: well look, for production you'd probably preprocess anyway (same as caching basically)
[09:19] SubStack: Qbix2: because I don't want to run a script every time I change a file, I want the server to figure all of that out when it fires up
[09:19] Qbix2: I'm talking to SubStack
[09:19] foobarfighter: ah ok...
[09:19] luke` has joined the channel
[09:19] SubStack: and in the future I'll set watches on all the files so it will update automatically at runtime
[09:19] Qbix2: SubStack: that's fine but look: you are doing all this because youw ant to put <script> tags in your browser
[09:19] Qbix2: if you had a javascript function called Q.require() or whatever,
[09:20] Qbix2: that function would just load the script asynchronously with xhr
[09:20] Qbix2: I mean, why not?
[09:20] SubStack: yes I hate that
[09:20] SubStack: is why
[09:20] Qbix2: just aesthetically somehow?
[09:20] SubStack: I want to share code between node.js and the client
[09:20] SubStack: I can't do that if I have to write shit differently
[09:20] Qbix2: Well, first of all I don't like the <script> mechanism, I think it's too clunky
[09:20] iszak has joined the channel
[09:20] Qbix2: you are leaving all the interpretation up to the browser
[09:20] iszak: Can we get an official node.js ppa?
[09:20] SubStack: doesn't matter, you only need one <script>
[09:20] Qbix2: and IE for example SUCKS with that
[09:21] Qbix2: <script> tags prevent the page from loading until they are fully downloaded and executed
[09:21] Qbix2: usually this is not what you want
[09:21] Qbix2: the browser is just paranoid about the "worst case"
[09:21] SubStack: I don't care about that
[09:21] SubStack: I just want to reuse my code already
[09:21] Qbix2: but once you care about it, you realize that you should be loading scripts with JS anyway :)
[09:21] SubStack: disagree
[09:21] Qbix2: and if you do that, then you can do w/e you want including wrapping it
[09:22] Qbix2: ok I'm just sayin'.
[09:22] larsemil: anyone have an idea on how to get clientId in the client when using node + socket.io? socket.on('clientConnect', function(client){ console.log(client.sessionId); does not work.
[09:22] Qbix2: you have more experience with node.js than I do.
[09:22] Qbix2: I'm just looking at your code now
[09:23] SubStack: yes I just want to reuse my node.js browser-side
[09:23] Qbix2: so prelude.js is what?
[09:23] SubStack: the first part of the wrapper
[09:23] Qbix2: who runs it - browser or node?
[09:24] SubStack: there are plenty of other client-side require() packages, mine just emphasizes reuse
[09:24] Qbix2: cool..

[09:25] abraham has joined the channel
[09:25] jesusabdullah: what's Q?
[09:25] SubStack: Qbix2: right I was looking through that a bit earlier
[09:25] Qbix2: It's my framework.
[09:25] SubStack: seems to be a kitchen sink approach like jquery
[09:26] andrewfff has joined the channel
[09:26] SubStack: which is cool, I use jquery all the time
[09:26] Qbix2: yeah, it tries to be javascript lib agnostic
[09:26] Qbix2: although most plugins use jquery
[09:26] Qbix2: Q is a framework for PHP, Node.js, and the web.
[09:26] Qbix2: And MySQL
[09:27] SubStack: but with browserify I'm trying to encourage less monolithic modules for client-side stuff
[09:27] Qbix2: well it's monolithic mainly for speed
[09:27] Qbix2: I don't want to download many resources
[09:27] Qbix2: I want to cache this just like jquery
[09:27] SubStack: yes well that's what server-side bundling gets you
[09:27] Qbix2: right so you either preprocess, or you cache
[09:28] Ezku\: SubStack: alright, figured as much. Plus it doesn't offer anything on the server side, iirc.
[09:28] SubStack: actually from a fitness perspective monolithic/library-driven software ecosystems are fascinating
[09:29] Qbix2: yea?
[09:29] Qbix2: like jquery and _ ?
[09:29] Qbix2: Q is not that monolithic, this is just the Q core
[09:29] Qbix2: var Users = Q.load('Users') would load the users plugin for ex
[09:29] SubStack: well in environments without a good module system and package manager like php or the browser, frameworks tend to hold more sway
[09:30] SubStack: but for stuff like node or perl, libraries are more dominant
[09:30] Qbix2: true
[09:30] CrazyGoogle: i love YUI

[09:30] CrazyGoogle: yeap
[09:30] mscdex: woo finally got realtime packet streaming under cygwin for node_pcap
[09:31] Ezku\: SubStack: yeah, that's true
[09:31] SubStack: monolithic programs and frameworks have their place in the fitness landscape of course
[09:31] Ezku\: i've been wondering about that myself
[09:31] Qbix2: substack: yeah I agree
[09:31] Qbix2: I like the node.js approach although it's a bit bewildering.
[09:31] Ezku\: because in the php landscape, everything is monolithic and getting small libraries in your projects is a hassle
[09:31] Qbix2: It's like Ruby with its open ended classes
[09:31] Qbix2: you can basically do anything, and you gotta follow some standard, but not everything follows the standard
[09:31] SubStack: I like to hang out around the library-driven side of things because I like reasoning about components in isolation
[09:31] Qbix2: like Connect.js is a standard now basicaly
[09:31] Qbix2: for middleware
[09:32] Ezku\: but i've been trying to foster a more open code-sharing environment at work, which has proven a bit difficult to say the least
[09:32] mscdex: i think either windows' or pcap's signalling sucks, but polling by consistently trying to read a packet works
[09:32] mscdex: :\
[09:32] SubStack: Ezku\: exactly
[09:32] Qbix2: yeah but what I distrust is the components interacting
[09:32] SubStack: Ezku\: and the same is true of browser-side javascript
[09:32] Ezku\: the barriers aren't just technological or institutional, but both :|
[09:32] SubStack: but not anymore!
[09:32] Qbix2: PHP had lots of small libraries
[09:32] Qbix2: see PEAR...
[09:32] Qbix2: but it sucked :(
[09:32] Qbix2: they all had different conventions
[09:32] Qbix2: ZF is like PEAR, but with common conventions
[09:32] Ezku\: Qbix2: yeah, everyone tends to shy away from PEAR
[09:33] Qbix2: zf is like the new pear
[09:33] SubStack: this is part of the reason why node is so exciting
[09:33] Ezku\: yes, but EVERYTHING in the same bundle
[09:33] Ezku\: SubStack: totally!
[09:33] SubStack: because it's such a new environment and people brought a ton of great ideas from other languages
[09:33] Ezku\: SubStack: everything is built of itsy bitsy, tiny, focused libraries
[09:33] SubStack: part of why npm is such win
[09:34] Nexxy: except when it tells you not to run it w/ sudo, but won't work unless you do
[09:34] Qbix2: I'm afraid of hodgepodges basically
[09:34] Qbix2: for websites
[09:34] Qbix2: I don't use Microsoft stuff but I'm more of a .NET philosophy
[09:34] Ezku\: Nexxy: you need to install it right :/
[09:34] Qbix2: or Java phiosophy
[09:34] Nexxy: Ezku\, I followed the instructions
[09:34] Qbix2: because tools tend to not be orthogonal enough
[09:34] Qbix2: and they all have diff conventions
[09:34] Nexxy: I'm not sure what else I should do
[09:35] Qbix2: whereas in a framework, everything fits into its own little slot, like drupal or something
[09:35] Ezku\: Nexxy: yeah, i know, it's kinda hard to get right. I messed things up my first install as well.
[09:35] sholmes: Why isn't npm found when I log in as another user?

[09:35] Qbix2: sholmes: check your $PATH

[09:35] Qbix2: echo $PATH
[09:36] sholmes: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
[09:36] Qbix2: is it diff from the other user
[09:36] Qbix2: do echo $PATH under other user
[09:36] sholmes: yes
[09:36] Qbix2: and you will see the problem :)
[09:36] sholmes: it is
[09:36] sholmes: I need to add more paths to my PATH
[09:36] sholmes: /root/local/bin:/root/local/bin:/root/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games

[12:53] tanepiper: something like this: https://gist.github.com/1a217597478cfad4388c

[12:55] chapel: sadly I am not at the point where I can go without seeing the output of my code in js
[12:55] sriley: you end up changing one language to an abstract language that far fewer people know or are willing to learn
[12:56] chapel: sriley: but its not like I dont know js, and dont know how my code turns into js

[12:56] SubStack: got an awesome patch earlier
[12:57] sriley: same goes with jade etc, they just make html/css/whatever harder to read and maintain

[13:01] jacksonmills: do you use coffeescript for node programming or front-facing as well, chapel?
[13:01] jacksonmills: seems like its just a quicker way to write server side JS without headaches
[13:01] chapel: both, though I haven't put it into production
[13:01] Kudos_: i'm trying to read up on process.binding, but it's not in the docs?

[13:11] narph: uhm

[13:12] jetienne_: narph: sure but how will they come 
[13:13] narph: jetienne_: depends on the module. most probably IO
[13:13] narph: jetienne_: but there is no main source of events
[13:13] narph: jetienne_: like a socket or something
[13:14] jetienne_: narph: you dont seem too sure :) well considere dnode

[15:42] DoNaLd`: how is it possible correctly processing this loop with storing data into DB and after then go through rest code ?
[15:43] ncb000gt: DoNaLd`: are the db calls async (I'd assume as much from your question)?

[15:43] fission6: i am trying to find a decent resource to read up on the event loop and how it works, any references?
[15:44] ncb000gt: DoNaLd`: ok. you could basically use a counter and check that the counter matches the size of the array. increment the counter at the end of each for loop function. once the counter matches, fire a function call to the code that depends on the data.
[15:44] ncb000gt: fission6: i wrote one on my blog...not sure it's the best overview, but i'd love critique :)

[16:20] tjholowaychuk: step in the right direction
[16:21] tjholowaychuk: i see a lot of potential with the plugins
[16:21] tjholowaychuk: I know mape could do some wicked GUI stuff for it
[16:21] slaskis: i have a set up where i have a set of connect servers using vhosts, could cluster support more than one server using some plugin?
[16:21] slaskis: oh yeah
[16:21] mape: tjholowaychuk: what?
[16:21] tjholowaychuk: slaskis: should still work with any regular connect server
[16:21] mikeal has joined the channel
[16:22] tjholowaychuk: slaskis: if you mean the vhost middleware
[16:22] chrischr_ has joined the channel
[16:22] tjholowaychuk: mape: http://learnboost.github.com/cluster/
[16:22] tjholowaychuk: its like spark
[16:22] tjholowaychuk: but better, and plugins !
[16:22] ncb000gt: tjholowaychuk: that does look pretty slick.
[16:22] Roconda has joined the channel
[16:22] tjholowaychuk: mape: with all your crazy GUI stuff like that dtrace thing I was like mannn that would be a slick plugin
[16:22] ncb000gt: might use it for some stuff i'm working on
[16:23] tjholowaychuk: ncb000gt: cool man
[16:23] slaskis: tjholowaychuk: yeah, well i don't really have to use the vhost module, but i'd like to start up all servers at once and make them respond to certain hosts, in the same way the vhost module does. But, also get separate logs and stats and cli as in cluster would be just kick ass
[16:23] ncb000gt: tjholowaychuk: i'll forward bugs/patches if I come up with anything. :)
[16:23] tjholowaychuk: slaskis: cluster(server).listen(80)
[16:23] tjholowaychuk: is all you should need to do
[16:24] tjholowaychuk: and just keep your connect stuff
[16:24] mape: tjholowaychuk: hmm yeah, actually I'm pretty pissed about that, you keep releasing cool stuff I need to work into older projects :P
[16:24] tjholowaychuk: ncb000gt: awesome sounds good
[16:24] tjholowaychuk: mape: hehe :D
[16:24] tjholowaychuk: I had started an interface but I was like nahhh nah mape will be much better at this

[16:25] slaskis: haha

[16:26] slaskis: hmm, could i perhaps cluster(server1).listen(80,"api.foo.com"); cluster(server2).listen(80,"www.foo.com") ?
[16:27] slaskis: or will them both being on the same host break something?
[16:27] slaskis: same port
[16:28] slaskis: tjholowaychuk: *
[16:28] slaskis: ^^ :P

[16:41] piscisaureus: mraleph: I will look into cygwin internals
[16:42] piscisaureus: can you get a stack trace for that call?
[16:42] mraleph: and who is this guy. I can't see WriteFile call in node.js
[16:42] piscisaureus: mraleph: probably libc write() calls WriteFile
[16:42] mraleph: whatever :-)
[16:42] piscisaureus: but is it possible to get a stack trace for it?
[16:43] mraleph: tick sample probably contains info about stack.
[16:43] mraleph: but you can probably just put a break in gdb

[16:45] slaskis: tjholowaychuk: hmm, removing the cli plugin made it work again

[18:29] dave48192: hi....trying to build node.js on cygwin and getting error: Build failed: -> task failed (err #2): {task: libv8.a SConstruct -> libv8.a}.  
[18:29] firdose: or use ajax to test it first
[18:29] dave48192: i have already tried export SHELL=/bin/bash
[18:29] firdose: dave48192: me too!
[18:30] firdose: scons is passing lib.exe a bad file
[18:30] firdose: it looks like '/nologo /OUT:v8.lib obj/release/accessors.o obj/release/allocation.o [...]' 
[18:30] firdose: but lib.exe needs win style paths
[18:30] flippyhead: How should I handle models with a has_many association to other models in backbone? I'd like to use nested_attributes, is that possible?
[18:30] mraleph: lib.exe? should no cygwin use ld?
[18:31] flippyhead: bah, sorry, wrong window
[18:31] Gruni has joined the channel
[18:31] firdose: scons is calling lib.exe
[18:31] niklasfi: hi, i have a question about parsing x-www-form-urlencoded form data. if for example i have an email input field containing "someone@example.com", the server then recieves email=someone%40example.com . how can i parse the latter to get the original string? somehow decodeURI does not seem to do the trick
[18:31] firdose: i know it is weird
[18:31] firdose: it used to work fine last time i built v0.2.2

[18:35] piscisaureus: ryah: I will make one for you
[18:35] firdose: or are there binaries out there for libv8?

[18:36] ryah: firdose: yes - you should give the error message
[18:36] mies has joined the channel
[18:36] ryah: firdose: which is hte line before the one you posted
[18:36] piscisaureus: ryah: maybe its better to swap that no-builtin-memcpy for no-strict-aliasing

[18:36] firdose: thats the error
[18:36] modular has joined the channel
[18:36] ryah: firdose: also you should be using the v0.4.0 tarball, are you?
[18:37] mraleph: ryah: scons is trying to link object files made by g++ with lib.exe
[18:37] piscisaureus: ryah: today mraleph found out that this causes significant perforance degradation on v8
[18:37] firdose: yeah 0.4.0
[18:37] ryah: piscisaureus: yeah, i saw the thread
[18:37] piscisaureus: good

[18:38] firdose: mraleph: now you see

[18:39] mraleph: firdose: what does "which lib" say if you execute it from cygwin shell?

[18:40] firdose: yes 
[18:40] mraleph: firdose: well that is your problem.

[18:40] leet has joined the channel
[18:41] firdose: the tempfile has unix style paths
[18:41] mraleph: firdose: rip off all MSVC paths from cygwin PATH
[18:41] firdose: lib cant find the files
[18:41] firdose: how exactly
[18:41] mraleph: firdose: you should not use MSVC when building on cygwin. that just sounds broken :-)
[18:41] firdose: its not me

[18:45] ezmobius has joined the channel
[18:45] firdose: scons is dumb
[18:46] pdeschamps: Hi All :) This may be not the right place but does anyone know if the "node-connect" middleware software is going to support HTTPS since the change in 4.0
[18:46] mraleph: firdose: you can't know what's the problem until you try 
[18:46] firdose: i could just do it by hand but once i have v8.lib built will make finish
[18:46] bartt has joined the channel
[18:46] mraleph: once again. v8.lib will do you no good
[18:47] mraleph: you need libv8.a
[18:47] firdose: well it looks to me like scons is generating a bad input file for lib.exe
[18:47] mraleph: you are building on cygwin
[18:47] ezmobius has joined the channel
[18:47] firdose: ok i will try
[18:48] abraham has joined the channel
[18:48] mraleph: there reason is why I suspect this paths is because I don't have them in my cygwin PATH and everything works just fine.
[18:48] pdeschamps: Looking at connect it doesn't use the new https module so since 4.0 you can no longer use the setSecure method on the http module. 
[18:48] mraleph: but I do have MSVS installed, and for example it confuses mingw build, but not a cygwin one.
[18:49] mraleph: so one of the difference between your setup and mine is those PATHs. if we find and eliminate the difference it will most probably work :-)

[19:16] fission6: ok, its pulling from /usr/local/lib/node/jsdom@0.1.23/index.js vs from within node_modules

[19:20] chapel: On line #58, the credentials event is ignored on one function, but runs fine when a longer function is run

[19:34] mikeal: isaacs: i saw
[19:34] isaacs: the issue isn't that node is somehow a "larger" project
[19:34] ryah: i want 1) a way to review code that doesn't suck 2) 2-up diffs 3) a simple bug system
[19:34] mjr_: ryah: you probably want to implement your github replacement on top of your botnet.
[19:35] mikeal: which is how i know there are ridiculously old bugs in there that were fixed months ago

[19:36] isaacs: you know what's awesome for code reviews?  patch files.
[19:36] isaacs: yeah...
[19:36] isaacs: love that.
[19:37] mjr_: toggling in the boot loader on the console
[19:37] mjr_: cave paintings
[19:37] mjr_: etc
[19:37] mikeal: isaacs: i prefer branch comparisons for review and then a patch diff for applying
[19:37] ryah: piscisaureus: i like Rietveld
[19:37] mikeal: a diff doesn't tell me if it still applies
[19:37] piscisaureus: ryah: I like rietveld for reviewing
[19:37] piscisaureus: but submitting a patch sucks bigtime
[19:38] ryah: submitting patches with rietveld is awesome
[19:38] ryah: it's the best thing ever.
[19:38] mikeal: i hate rietveld
[19:38] mikeal: fuckin diffs
[19:38] ryah: piscisaureus: you have to use git-cl
[19:38] piscisaureus: ryah: yeah I use git-cl
[19:38] ryah: it's beautiful
[19:38] Bioxyde has joined the channel
[19:38] piscisaureus: but i keep forgetting to use the right topic branch for my issues
[19:38] halfhalo: ACTION uses NOTHING
[19:38] isaacs: yeah, my first experience with it last night was pretty painless.
[19:38] isaacs: i wouldn't call it "beautiful", though
[19:38] piscisaureus: so I end up with a ton of review issues
[19:38] isaacs: it's kinda weird how it squashes 3 commits into a single aptch
[19:39] isaacs: would make more sense to just email 3 patch files to a mailing list.
[19:39] ryah: review one commit at a time
[19:39] mikeal: we should just write some code that gives ryan actual patches for pull requests on a branch
[19:39] ryah: that's exactly what i want
[19:39] mikeal: and sends an email to the list when one is submitted
[19:39] Bonuspunkt has joined the channel
[19:39] isaacs: ryah: sure, but then, if i do `git-cl`, it should know that there are 3 commits, and not squash them
[19:39] mikeal: you want to review the current state of the branch
[19:39] mikeal: and when it changes be notified
[19:39] flukes1 has left the channel
[19:39] mikeal: and do inline comments on the state of the branch that don't apply once that section changes
[19:39] isaacs: ryah: git format-patch HEAD^^^^; gist *.patch; send-email
[19:39] isaacs: bam.
[19:40] mikeal: fuck reviewing 8 diffs
[19:40] ryah: gist doesn't work
[19:40] isaacs: ryah: it does now, actually.
[19:40] isaacs: ryah: you have to remove and re-instal
[19:40] mikeal: because a gist changes and you don't know why
[19:40] piscisaureus: ngist?
[19:40] isaacs: but the rubygem one works
[19:40] isaacs: mikeal: gists should be locked down, imo.
[19:40] isaacs: no editing.  make a new one.
[19:40] mikeal: seriously, pull requests are 90% there
[19:41] mikeal: reviewing diffs doesn't work for large patches that take a long time
[19:41] mikeal: ryah: have you used the commenting inside a long running pull request?
[19:42] ryah: waiting for node gist
[19:42] isaacs: really, i think all this stuff is just extra fluff.  issues and reitveld are just a fancier email list.
[19:42] Aikar: whats git-cl O.o

[19:44] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: o ya shit how did that npm pre stuff go?
[19:44] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: didn't do it.  it's only a one-line patch in npm, but it's more involved in the registry
[19:44] isaacs: not against it, just haven't gotten to it
[19:44] mikeal: should master be 0.5.0pre?
[19:44] ryah: https://gist.github.com/830023 <-- works
[19:44] ryah: beautiful!
[19:44] mikeal: are we ready to start landing 0.5 stuff yet

[19:48] ryah: chapel: two things about ngist 1) shouldn't need -f 2) don't indent the -h output
[19:48] ryah: chapel: otherwise, good work
[19:48] chapel: well yeah gonna fix the -h output
[19:49] micxer has joined the channel
[19:49] chapel: using -f is somewhat of a limitation of optimist, being that if I had options -lop file.js
[19:49] chapel: well file.js would be assigned to p

[19:51] chapel: I agree that not using -f would simplify things a bit

[19:52] chapel: haha
[19:52] isaacs: Seriously, you know what would be SOOOOCUUULL!!!?
[19:53] chapel: I have a module made
[19:53] chapel: so you can use it programmatically
[19:53] chapel: just fixing up the cli, and then gonna push it
[19:53] isaacs: if there was a way to have a cli program that could be used to check out a node program from its npm info, make some changes, and then send a patch and stuff to the relevant project
[19:53] isaacs: or see where you'er at and do all that
[19:54] milez has joined the channel
[19:54] isaacs: like a no-frills way, just post a github issue with a gist of the patch
[19:54] chapel: well I could easily do something like that, as long as issues use the same user/token auth
[19:54] kiddphunk has joined the channel
[19:55] isaacs: chapel: also, the rubygem gist uses a "github.user" and "github.token" git configs.  any chance you could make ngist do that?
[19:56] chapel: it does use them
[19:56] chapel: :)
[19:56] mikeal has joined the channel
[19:56] chapel: in the new version I am working on, you can use those that are set, you can set them, or just use your user/token as a one off
[19:57] chapel: isaacs: do you have somewhere with 0.3.0 changes for npm?
[19:57] isaacs: chapel: hm.  seems like it didn't.  why's this anonymous? https://gist.github.com/830039
[19:57] isaacs: chapel: writing it up now
[19:57] chapel: are you sure they are set?
[19:58] chapel: you would have to do: ngist -l with it
[19:59] isaacs: chapel: https://gist.github.com/830058
[19:59] isaacs: chapel: what i mean is, i've already set them in my git config
[19:59] Coal has joined the channel
[19:59] chapel: hmm
[19:59] isaacs: could ngist just read them from there?

[20:01] chapel: what was the ngist command you used?
[20:01] isaacs: oh, no, that's a stream, you gotta pull off the data events or whatever.
[20:01] void_ has joined the channel
[20:01] isaacs: derp
[20:01] chapel: ngist -l -f patch.js
[20:01] chapel: that would check the git config for the user and token

[20:02] isaacs: $ ngist -l -f 0001-Add-shebang.patch 
[20:02] isaacs: No username or token set with git.
[20:02] isaacs: For help: ngist -h
[20:02] isaacs: chapel: ^
[20:02] chapel: hmm
[20:02] chapel: let me check
[20:02] isaacs: chapel: are you reading the config files yourself, or asking git in a child process?
[20:02] chapel: well I have mine set as git config --global github.user/token
[20:02] chapel: and they are gathered fine
[20:02] isaacs: chapel: well, there ya go.  mine are set as git config --simple
[20:03] isaacs: *system

[20:05] chapel: so how would I ask git, just --get?

[20:12] isaacs: piscisaureus: nice
[20:12] chapel: so first try straight --get
[20:12] isaacs: btw, your phone is alphabetically above yours :)
[20:12] chapel: if I get an error

[20:25] isaacs: Kingdutch: sure, but if the data.rows.item(10) has some Object.defineProperty()'ed properties that are read-only, then you'll see the behavior you described.

[21:04] kkaefer: ryah: ok; may I ask why?
[21:04] ncb000gt: how is it not working?

[21:41] hunterloftis: thx, 1 sec, trying to figure out how to figure out redis version
[21:41] hunterloftis: --version does nada
[21:42] tjholowaychuk: redis-server --version
[21:42] tjholowaychuk: should work
[21:42] hunterloftis: yeah that's what I tried
[21:42] tjholowaychuk: hm
[21:42] hunterloftis: it thinks --version is a config file
[21:42] hunterloftis: weird yeah
[21:42] tjholowaychuk: even when you start up redis-server it should output the version
[21:43] tjholowaychuk: or redis-cli info
[21:43] hunterloftis: I think that may be the issue, because locally (where it works) redis-server --version works fine
[21:43] tjholowaychuk: redis-cli info | grep redis_version
[21:43] hunterloftis: ah!
[21:43] hunterloftis: fuck

[22:22] tbranyen: yeah i've been using a shared struct with persistent values
[22:22] pquerna: when you create a v8 string / object/ array etc, v8 will splatter the memory all over etc
[22:23] pquerna: so its gotta be done in the after cb
[22:23] tjholowaychuk: i was wondering about that too, for better image streaming in node-canvas
[22:24] pquerna: you could do some hacks to make a buffer in the worker thread
[22:24] pquerna: and then move that into a node buffer in the after cb
[22:24] pquerna: without doing a memcpy
[22:24] fission6 has joined the channel

[22:40] tilgovi: maybe that's too much to ask, though
[22:40] tilgovi: I like the simplicity of the new build
[22:40] isaacs: tilgovi: well.. the issue is that the packages might want ot modify their contents.
[22:40] isaacs: which should be allowed.
[22:40] isaacs: for instance, if a web server has some file cache or something
[22:40] tilgovi: mm
[22:40] isaacs: if it's installed as you, but the command is started as "nobody", then you're boned.
[22:41] isaacs: you *can* install them and run them as you if you do `npm config set user $USER`
[22:41] isaacs: but then your'e back to just doing stuff sans-sudo and with --unsafe-perms, effectively
[22:41] tilgovi: right

[22:45] tmzt: one of our hosting provider is a registrar but they aren't so good on the integration stuff
[22:45] Sebmaster: isaacs: its running as root
[22:45] Sebmaster: on cygwin tho
[22:45] isaacs: Sebmaster: Error: Could not get uid/gid: {"error":", No error","errno":0} is super weid.
[22:45] isaacs: ohh, ok
[22:45] Evet: are you using nodejs on windows?,
[22:45] isaacs: that's odd, it should bedefaulting unsafe-perms to true on cygwin and win32

[22:48] aurynn: tjholowaychuk, how do I tell it to reload my workers?
[22:48] tjholowaychuk: you can use telnet to access the REPL and inspect the workers and system status
[22:48] tjholowaychuk: aurynn: SIGUSR2
[22:48] aurynn: Oh cool

[22:48] isaacs: wow, i broke adduser/config something FIERCE just now...

[22:50] chrischris has joined the channel
[22:50] tmzt: supports app.js?
[22:50] orls: cluster looks really nice
[22:50] tmzt: meaning module.exports = server
[22:51] langworthy has joined the channel
[22:51] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: its not a command-line tool like spark
[22:51] tmzt: so we need gitfs.require()
[22:51] tjholowaychuk: but you could have run.js or something cluster(require('./app')).listen(80)
[22:51] tmzt: yeah, that just makes it difficult to do port configuration
[22:52] tmzt: not a huge issue
[22:52] tjholowaychuk: a cli is just not as flexible
[22:52] tjholowaychuk: you can just check NODE_ENV and switch around the port or whatever else

[22:52] mscdex: is cluster http only?

[22:53] orls: so no https?
[22:53] _schulte_: isaacs: I can confirm npm install now works for me, thanks for the quick fix
[22:53] tmzt: this should beat nginx+spark+app.js though
[22:53] isaacs: _schulte_: nice
[22:53] tjholowaychuk: spark is missing a bunch of features
[22:53] tmzt: vhost support?
[22:54] piscisaureus: python. beh
[22:54] Sebmaster: isaacs: You already got the problem?
[22:54] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: it does not tough requests
[22:55] tjholowaychuk: touch*
[22:55] tjholowaychuk: its not a proxy
[22:55] tmzt: seriously, gitfs.require would make this perfect, I don't know how to add that exactly yet but I'll look at wheat again and see if I can figure it out
[22:55] tmzt: also, I don't know if you can replace a builtin like require
[22:56] _schulte_ has left the channel
[22:56] isaacs: Sebmaster: can you post an issue?
[22:56] isaacs: that'd be very helpful
[22:56] Sebmaster: on github?
[22:56] tmzt: tjholowaychuk: hmm okay, but how do you handle vhosts without a proxy like nginx, etc.
[22:57] tmzt: I mean it's not enough for each node instance to fail if it doesn't match so middleware won't quite work
[22:57] tjholowaychuk: tmzt: connect has a vhost middleware you could try
[22:57] tjholowaychuk: ah
[22:57] tmzt: probably easier just to pass a special header from nginx as x-real-ip is done
[22:57] tmzt: then I can use middleware for that part
[22:57] tmzt: but only for one site

[23:09] bbttxu has joined the channel
[23:10] xandrews: assigning to the context object only works if the property doesn't exist yet
[23:11] Sebmaster: bradleymeck: You have to configure a nameserver in /etc/resolv.conf, otherwise DNS is broken

[23:14] bradleymeck: sebmaster, i made that and just checked it, but still getting errors
[23:14] TheEmpath: anyone know what (function(window){ /* lol stuff */ }(window)); means?
[23:15] Sebmaster: bradleymeck: gist the errors somewhere
[23:15] tjholowaychuk:  TheEmpath: cant overwite the window var
[23:15] tjholowaychuk: within that scope
[23:15] bradleymeck: sebmaster just the typical "ECONNREFUSED, Could not contact DNS server"
[23:15] Sebmaster: when you try to connect somewhere with node?
[23:16] ilpoldo has joined the channel
[23:16] bradleymeck: yea, fudging around w/ line endings
[23:17] Sebmaster: what does your resolv.conf look like?
[23:18] bradleymeck: nm, added a blank line at top and seems to be working... odd

[23:19] micheil: fixed the parser up, I think it works quite well now.
[23:20] micheil: Maybe be even able to automatically convert current docs across to the new format
[23:20] micheil: s/Maybe/Might/

[23:20] isaacs: Sebmaster: hey, can you tell me what this does on your cygwin?  node -e process.platform
[23:21] firdose has joined the channel
[23:21] Sebmaster: cygwin
[23:21] mikeal has joined the channel
[23:21] firdose: hi
[23:21] firdose: just wanted to pop in and say how much i am enjoying node.js ;)
[23:22] tjholowaychuk: :D
[23:22] ryah: micheil: sample?
[23:22] jimt has joined the channel
[23:23] micheil: https://gist.github.com/830534
[23:23] micheil: I'm just testing on the auto-convert
[23:23] kkaefer: so... in ObjectWrap, it says that I shouldn't call Unref() from the constructor
[23:23] firdose: i keep forgetting i am writing server side because its in javascript
[23:23] tjholowaychuk: micheil: should parse the args too
[23:23] kkaefer: does that only refer to that object's destructor?
[23:23] tjholowaychuk: optional / defaults n stuff
[23:23] chapel: isaacs: what is the format the user/pass should be in .npmrc?
[23:24] kkaefer: i.e. can I call ->Unref() from another object that holds a reference to the object it Unref()s?
[23:24] chapel: I added myself on another computer for npm, not sure how to login otherwise
[23:24] isaacs: chapel: should be _auth = base64(username:password)
[23:24] clarkfischer has joined the channel
[23:24] isaacs: chapel: or just run `npm adduser` and it'll do it for you
[23:24] micheil: tjholowaychuk: does that.
[23:24] mscdex: psh and people thought i was crazy for suggesting a json node api
[23:24] ryah: kkaefer: what are you using Ref/Unref for?
[23:25] micheil: automatically detects foo(a, [b]) with a as required and b as optional
[23:25] tjholowaychuk: micheil: bahaha I completely missed that
[23:25] tjholowaychuk: some how
[23:25] ryah: kkaefer: they are only to hold the object while in the enent loop...
[23:25] fizx has joined the channel
[23:25] kkaefer: ryah: I have a prepared statement object that holds a reference to the database object
[23:25] ryah: we should really just hold a global reference to them now that we have this nice linked list object.
[23:25] kkaefer: I'm unfortunately still doing 0.2
[23:26] ryah: kkaefer: why are you still doing 0.2?
[23:26] kkaefer: because the dependencies are 0.2
[23:26] ryah: hm
[23:26] ryah: you should try running it on 0.4 - shouldn't be hard
[23:26] kkaefer: ...and I want to make sure that the db object isn't gc'ed when there's only a prepared statement object left
[23:27] ryah: but let's get back to your question
[23:27] micheil: damn... overloaded functions are going to be a PITA
[23:27] kkaefer: (https://github.com/mapbox/tilemill/blob/master/.ndistro are our dependencies, btw)

[23:31] firdose: does node have a process managment interface to keep it running or reboot it if it stops? or should i just treat it like any other process/daemon?
[23:31] chapel: yay finally....
[23:31] chapel: tanepiper ryah isaacs https://github.com/chapel/ngist and to anyone else that cares
[23:31] tjholowaychuk: firdose: http://learnboost.github.com/cluster/
[23:31] samcday: Maybe a stupid question, but does anyone know of a transaction manager for node?
[23:32] firdose: tj: thnx
[23:32] humanchimp: any way to get something like process.memoryUsage() for child processes spawned with require('child_process').spawn ?
[23:32] micheil: argh... got caught out by typeof []
[23:32] micheil: tjholowaychuk: got anything for managing workers yet; that aren't part of a server?
[23:33] tjholowaychuk: micheil: why not use that node-webworkers thing?
[23:33] kkaefer: tjholowaychuk: http://developmentseed.org/blog/2011/feb/16/announcing-tilemill-modern-map-design-studio-powered-open-source
[23:33] micheil: because it's.. kinda old and not optimized
[23:33] tjholowaychuk: kkaefer: slick !
[23:34] tjholowaychuk: micheil: ah
[23:34] samcday: ? All it does is spawn new node instances
[23:34] ajcates_ has joined the channel
[23:34] tjholowaychuk: dunno, maybe I will when we need it
[23:34] samcday: And uses web sockets to pass msgs and fds
[23:34] tjholowaychuk: ?
[23:34] firdose: wow tilemill looks nice
[23:34] micheil: tjholowaychuk: I may fork cluster and write it from that.
[23:35] mikeal has joined the channel
[23:35] humanchimp: samcday: i dpn
[23:35] micheil: samcday: uh, yeah, that's what node-webworkers does, but I think it can be done better / simpler
[23:35] humanchimp: i don't know what you mean
[23:35] micheil: essentially what I'm needing is just the overlord for the workers, and an optional message passing channel
[23:35] devrim: tjholowaychuk does your cluster.cli tracks memory/resource usage ?
[23:35] Sebmaster: chapel: You got a syntax error in the readme. User and password are not quoted.
[23:36] tjholowaychuk: devrim: what do you mean by "track" ?
[23:36] devrim: like you can say dont exceed 512mb
[23:36] micheil: tjholowaychuk: I'm also needing something where I could have cluster as a server, then have it proxy to upstream servers
[23:36] chapel: yeah thanks
[23:36] micheil: devrim: use something like monit, I'd say
[23:36] chapel: its late for me, rushing through the readme
[23:37] devrim: micheil, monit is not per process tool
[23:37] micheil: :/
[23:37] devrim: once we run a job on cluster we want to assign limits to it so it wont crash it
[23:38] devrim: which is possible with process package.. but when we spawned bash commands
[23:38] tjholowaychuk: devrim: create a cluster plugin :)
[23:38] devrim: we couldnt find a way to correctly track the resource usage of processes
[23:39] tjholowaychuk: not exploding your process should be a per-worker thing though
[23:39] tjholowaychuk: not handled by master
[23:40] bmavity has joined the channel
[23:40] devrim: thx tj
[23:40] devrim: i guess we need modejs module for this particular case
[23:40] bmavity: Sooo, a variable declared without the var keyword ends up on global? I'm assuming that's supposed to happen? ;)
[23:41] tanepiper: chapel: oh nice, you can do gists in files now :D
[23:41] Sebmaster: isaacs: Your patch didn't fix it

[23:48] firdose: its based on ComonJS right?

[23:48] halfhalo: method missing or gtfo

[23:59] Chainfire: hey, im completely new to node.js. I've done a lot of reading about it today, and I'm still wondering which things (excluding comet and messaging) it really really makes sense to use node.js instead of other solutions; pretty much im looking for concrete examples where it really shines. I've been trying to think of some but mostly I end up with "but there's specialized X for that".
