[00:11] jacobolus has joined the channel
[00:11] tim_smart: s0l1dsnak3123: You can send any data you like over http, it just depends how the server is expecting it.
[00:12] bradleymeck: he likely needs it in chunked encoding if hes talking to virtually anything w/ a file upload
[00:12] tim_smart: var request = http.request(...); var read_stream = fs.createReadStream('/my/file'); read_stream.pipe(request);
[00:13] tim_smart: done.
[00:13] bradleymeck: could have sworn there was a multipart writer somewhere
[00:13] jonrh has joined the channel
[00:13] s0l1dsnak3123: Ok, well the server expects it as multipart form data I would assume :)
[00:13] bradleymeck: tim_smart, yes but he needs to encode it to chunked/multipart
[00:14] tim_smart: read_stream.pipe(some_multipart_encoder); some_multipart_encoder.pipe(request);
[00:14] bradleymeck: yub we need to find where that encoder is

[01:12] mikeal has joined the channel
[01:13] stylus: it looks like it cannot find the module 'semver' while trying to install npm. does this have something to do with nodejs changing the way that it resolves modules (in a recent update)?

[01:24] samcday: Considering your code is allocating V8 objects in EIO threads
[01:25] tbranyen: not anymore :)
[01:25] Guest52293: ok, I'll take that as a "no" and craw back under my Window.
[01:25] samcday: Ah ok you fixed it, nice
[01:25] isaacs: stylus: are you *quite sure* you're using node 0.4.2?
[01:25] astropirate: With Connect, how is 'mounting' a middleware to path any different to just registering a middleware?

[01:25] tbranyen: yeah i really appreciate that tip
[01:25] samcday: No worries man
[01:25] tbranyen: since that issue was tripping me up
[01:25] tbranyen: reread that cloudfront article
[01:26] tbranyen: and saw it there and was pissed i overlooked it
[01:26] tjholowaychuk: astropirate: because you can "mount" an entire app
[01:26] samcday: Anyway, I'm more focusing on makign my async stuff rock solid in a single process
[01:26] tjholowaychuk: astropirate: and it can operate on paths relative to the mount-point
[01:26] tbranyen: hmmmm
[01:26] samcday: Since libgit2 isn't thread-safe, there's all sorts of fucked up stuff happening if you do more than one thing with libgit2 straight up
[01:26] samcday: Like for example
[01:26] samcday: Have you actually tried working with commit objects asynchronously in one process?
[01:26] samcday: More than 100 at once, in one process
[01:26] tbranyen: yeah, but not complicated stuff
[01:27] samcday: You're going to experience a world of hurt.
[01:27] tbranyen: just reading a repo and a revision walk
[01:27] samcday: yeah that's baby stuff
[01:27] echosystm has joined the channel
[01:27] samcday: For example, if you do a revision walk while saving a commit and maybe like, adding a parent to a commit somewhere
[01:27] samcday: It's going to segfault. Guaranteed.
[01:27] samcday: Inrernally, libgit2 has no mutexes or semaphores anywhere
[01:27] echosystm: anyone here familiar with libev/libeio ?
[01:28] stepheneb has joined the channel
[01:28] samcday: Like in short tbranyen, if you have 2 eio threads sitting there
[01:28] samcday: And one of them reads from the same commit, while the other does something to that same commitg
[01:28] samcday: It is guaranteed to break
[01:28] astropirate: tjholowaychuk, i see what you mean, thanks
[01:28] samcday: echosystm, What do you want to know
[01:29] tbranyen: samcday: interesting
[01:29] tbranyen: i guess for the stuff i'm using this for
[01:29] tbranyen: none of that would happen
[01:29] samcday: How do you figure?
[01:29] echosystm: well, i understand how you can use select/epoll/etc to multiplex some io events on sockets and so on
[01:29] eaton has joined the channel
[01:29] eaton has joined the channel
[01:29] echosystm: but then you need some generic thread pooling for timers and file io
[01:30] echosystm: how does libeio multiplex between select and things registered via eio_custom and the like ?
[01:30] samcday: Ah shit I dunno haha...
[01:31] samcday: I know that eio seems to like spawning as many threads as there are cores
[01:31] samcday: That's just what I've noticed when I use gdb
[01:31] echosystm: is my understanding correct?
[01:31] echosystm: like, select is used wherever possible, but all other things (timers, file io, etc.) must be run in some generic thread pool(s) ?
[01:32] tbranyen: samcday: i dunno for the size repos and the testing i already did which has a decent amount of info i'd need it didn't segfault
[01:32] Metapony has joined the channel
[01:32] springmeyer has joined the channel
[01:32] samcday: tbranyen: Yeah but in a server environment, you might have several requests come in at once on the same repo
[01:32] samcday: echosystm, I believe so
[01:33] samcday: Not 100% on that though
[01:33] echosystm: ok
[01:33] samcday: Sorry ;)
[01:33] echosystm: no worries
[01:33] forzan has joined the channel
[01:34] SubStack: isaacs: still getting the same error :/
[01:34] springmeyer: hey all. I have a hung nodejs process, and I've inspected the running processes in gdb
[01:34] isaacs: SubStack: that's reallyodd
[01:34] springmeyer: but gdb gives not clues to the cause: https://gist.github.com/866922
[01:34] samcday: My biggest concern tbranyen is that sure you might be getting good performance doing simple stuff, but in the rare case that someone uses your library to do something even slightly more complicated
[01:34] SubStack: were there any important npm updates?
[01:34] samcday: They're going to get obscure segfaults randomly
[01:34] springmeyer: does anyone have suggestions for how to figure out the cause of this hang/deadlock?
[01:34] bigjay has joined the channel
[01:34] samcday: I absolutely guarantee you they will
[01:34] isaacs: SubStack: hm... nothing that should affect publishing.
[01:35] samcday: tbranyen, The only thing that would nullify what I just said is if libgit2 became thread-safe internally
[01:35] maushu has joined the channel
[01:36] samcday: In which case, the 3 days I've spent writing bullshit workarounds for the lack of thread-safety would be wasted haha
[01:36] tbranyen: samcday: man thats a bummer
[01:36] isaacs: SubStack: published and unpublished a little package, no trouble there...
[01:36] isaacs: now trying a bigger one
[01:36] isaacs: SubStack: you don't have your registry configured to use https, do you?
[01:37] isaacs: yeah, worked with the big one, too
[01:37] samcday: I've got my stuff pretty rock solid now though, what I'm actually doing is using libeio to get a commit from the repo, and then if I haven't already allocated a JS object for it, I go into *another* EIO thread to load all the data into a struct, then populate that data into the JS object when I get back to the main thread
[01:37] tbranyen: memoizing?
[01:37] samcday: So in the end, your lib is probably a little more performant than mine, but mine is not blocking the main thread at all
[01:37] samcday: 'Cos if you look at how libgit2 works internally, with commits for example
[01:37] samcday: It may or may not fully parse the commit
[01:37] tbranyen: oh wait, i see two separate non blocking operations
[01:38] samcday: When you load it via git_commit_parent for example
[01:38] samcday: It may not fully parse the underlying git_object for the data
[01:38] samcday: In which case, if you were to call those operations on the main thread
[01:38] samcday: You'd be blocking the main thread
[01:38] samcday: In a server environment, that would be baaaaaad
[01:38] samcday: Even if it was only for 5-10ms
[01:38] tbranyen: yea def, i see what you're saying
[01:38] colinsullivan has joined the channel
[01:38] samcday: I pushed alot of stuff last night
[01:38] tbranyen: node needs to remain as non blocking and quickly executing as possible
[01:38] samcday: Yeah
[01:38] Metapony has joined the channel
[01:39] samcday: I had to write a fairly convoluted system that I pushed last nigjht
[01:39] samcday: employing a few different mutexes during init situation
[01:39] tbranyen: yeah i probably wouldn't understand it if i looked at it
[01:39] samcday: liek for example
[01:39] samcday: If you were to async load a commit
[01:39] samcday: Then immediately afterwards, synchronously load the same commit on main thread
[01:39] samcday: You have to make sure you're not stepping on toes there either, I'm catering for stupid obscure situations ... one may argue these may never happen
[01:40] samcday: But if you have a long running server sitting there working with repo data, you just never know
[01:40] samcday: And you definitely can't afford to have the server segfault mid-request
[01:40] samcday: Feel free to use the stuff I've done though, if you can somehow make use of it :D
[01:40] tbranyen: yeah i'm interested to see how rigorous your unit tests will be to test that
[01:40] samcday: I've written some stress tests
[01:40] samcday: I was about ready to give up the first 2 days lol
[01:41] stylus: isaacs: yep, i'm sure. that is the command i used to find out the version earlier.
[01:41] samcday: Constant segfaults, everywhere from V8 lazy compiler to the garbage collection
[01:41] samcday: then even internally in git_vector
[01:41] isaacs: stylus: please gist the *exact* output your'e seeing.
[01:42] tbranyen: yeah segfaults were really prevalant before
[01:42] stylus: isaacs: raincheck, i've got to get the shopping done :) thanks for your help, will be back.

[03:53] lastk: yes..
[03:53] monokrome: Okay, then moreso something to be compared with Ruby+EventMachine or Python+Twisted.

[03:54] lastk: so, about using nodejs with ruby or python or even php

[04:52] DTrejo: SubStack: I'm only just now looking at now.js, but where do you see the return values? do you mean the magic variables like now.likecatsalot = "YES"?
[04:52] zeqeiroz: :davemo thanks!! :D
[04:52] SubStack: DTrejo: in the callbacks on the server side you return values
[04:53] davemo: zeqeiroz: there's also dox
[04:53] noahcampbell has joined the channel
[04:53] SubStack: and then it looks like it adds the return values as implicit callback parameters to the function call
[04:53] DTrejo: ah, yes, now I see
[04:54] SubStack: I considered that approach for dnode but settled on a more general solution where you just pass in functions directly yourself and dnode wraps them
[04:54] reid has joined the channel
[04:54] SubStack: which the added benefit that you can throw around hashes full of functions and whatever other attributes you please
[04:54] zeqeiroz: :davemo i will go to try selleck, if not ok, i 'll go of dox thx
[04:54] davemo: flexibility in an api > implicit magic imho SubStack 
[04:54] SubStack: it also makes the protocol more symmetric
[04:56] ericzz has joined the channel
[04:56] SubStack: davemo: well the general approach is probably more "magical"
[04:56] SubStack: but implicit parameters seem more surprising
[04:57] SubStack: I guess it's also surprising that you can just pass around functions however you please, but that is the good kind of surprise since people will be more conservative in their expectations
[04:59] DTrejo: SubStack: you're saying that's true of dnode or of nowjs?
[05:00] SubStack: dnode
[05:00] SubStack: for the last point
[05:00] SubStack: it seems that nowjs uses implicit parameters for return values
[05:02] SubStack: I love it when libraries alter expectations
[05:03] SubStack: like how sinatra cased people to expect web frameworks to be comprehensible in just a few lines
[05:03] ocirs has joined the channel
[05:04] davemo: paradigm shift ;)
[05:04] DTrejo: SubStack: with nowjs I'm having trouble wrapping my head around the various magical things, mostly b/c it feels like there's a few kinds, rather than one thing that you use to do everything

[05:06] zeqeiroz: how node documentation is generated? by dox, by selleck, or write on-hand the markdowns?

[06:29] zab: xml2js is currently broken with npm
[06:29] zab: jesusabdullah: link?
[06:32] jesusabdullah: https://github.com/aredridel/html5
[06:33] zab: jesusabdullah: hmm its a streaming event driven parser, i'm looking for a dom-based one which supports xml path
[06:33] jesusabdullah: dom-based?
[06:34] jesusabdullah: What do you mean?
[06:34] zab: creates a tree in memory and you are then able to query that tree
[06:34] jesusabdullah: Closest thing I can think of is jsdom

[07:42] Aria: You're doing it wrong.
[07:42] Aria: Break your functions up.
[07:42] Aria: Make your own EventEmitters if you need.

[07:42] SubStack: and later, write your own flow control lib

[09:38] Murugaratham: the example given by socket.io is not bad but i dunno how to allow users to "sign in"
[09:38] Murugaratham: so that when they chat we can see their user name instead of their session id

[09:42] Murugaratham: so when websockets aren't avail, comet will be used right
[09:42] jetienne: well there are 2 versions of easywebsocket. one on top of node, one on top of googla app engine
[09:43] jetienne: Murugaratham: if no websocket, it fall back on other transports. comet is just a fuzzy word used to say "real time connection"
[09:43] Murugaratham: oo
[09:43] jetienne: but yes this is very compatible
[09:43] Murugaratham: basically it's a long time-out connection?
[09:43] jetienne: Murugaratham: you keep saying oo. what does this mean ?
[09:43] Murugaratham: means oh
[09:43] Murugaratham: lol
[09:43] jetienne: Murugaratham: yep long time pooling of one of them
[09:44] jetienne: let me get you the list
[09:44] Murugaratham: okie

[13:36] adamt: sec

[15:17] Gigawatt: http://pastebin.com/953HbY2B
[15:17] juliank: mscdex: In the real world code, the readFile is a login check which may rad from the database.
[15:17] mscdex: ok?
[15:17] juliank: mscdex: I don't want to process the body of unauthorized users.
[15:17] Gigawatt: check that pastebin guys
[15:18] Gigawatt: it says there was an internal error with the debugger ?
[15:18] mscdex: juliank: so how are you determining if they're authorized or not?
[15:19] mscdex: by http header or ?
[15:19] dominictarr has joined the channel
[15:19] juliank: mscdex: Yes (Basic Auth). I get username + passwd from headers, ask database to load user and check that password match and then continue processing the request
[15:19] juliank: The problem seems to be that node already read the body when it read the header and queued the events for the current loop, so pause() dooes not work

[15:24] Lion2Leo: adamt: Has to start with ./

[15:25] abrahamwilliams has joined the channel
[15:25] mscdex: although, even with pause() you may still get some events iirc
[15:25] juliank: But since the complete request was already in and the events thus already scheduled, it did nothing
[15:27] mscdex: it probably does pause, but by the time you paused, there were probably events that were already emitted
[15:27] mscdex: and your request was small enough to fit in one data event
[15:27] mscdex: i'm guessing
[15:27] juliank: mscdex: yes
[15:28] mscdex: and if that'll usually be the case, it wouldn't be that much to buffer anyway
[15:28] mscdex: there has been some discussion about the current behavior of pause() on the ML
[15:29] mscdex: i think someone even wrote a version that buffers events and replays them in order after .resume()
[15:30] mscdex: and pauses immediately or something

[16:58] augustl: is there a way to check if a http.request has connected to a server, and the connection is still open?
[16:58] augustl: what I'm actually trying to do: integration test that my server keeps a connection open
[17:00] __tosh has joined the channel
[17:00] floby1: augustl: you can access the underlying socket of a httprequest object. this socket object contains the information you want
[17:01] Max-Might has joined the channel
[17:01] augustl: floby1: thanks
[17:03] augustl: hmm, I can't think of what exactly I should check
[17:03] augustl: other than listening to the "connect" event of the socket, timeouting for 100ms or so, and if the request is still open, assume that the server will never close it.
[17:04] augustl: perhaps that's a sensible way to check that
[17:05] EyePulp has joined the channel
[17:05] floby1: you can listen to the connect event and also the end event which is triggered when your socket is receives a FIN packet from the server
[17:07] augustl: I would probably still need to do a timeout I guess?
[17:07] augustl: i.e. on the connect event, set a timeout on 100 ms, if the end event wasn't called within those 100 ms, success
[17:07] floby1: oh sure why not.
[17:08] dingomanatee: That is not a bulletproof test - servers can hang on occasion. 
[17:08] augustl: indeed
[17:08] floby1: is this for testing purpose or do you need your program do do this automatically ?
[17:08] dingomanatee: You'd get false negatives.
[17:08] augustl: this is a node http server that I start in the seUp, but still
[17:08] augustl: the machine could be slow because of other processes etc
[17:08] augustl: s/seUp/setUp
[17:08] dingomanatee: I think the best test for a server's up-ness is a request's response. 
[17:08] q_no has joined the channel
[17:09] floby1: yes
[17:09] floby1: I don't understand very well what your use case is augustl
[17:09] dingomanatee: You can of course set a daemon that requests - say - the favicon and notes the response time and the content which should be predictable. 
[17:09] augustl: I wan to test that the server doesn't close the connection, though
[17:09] dingomanatee: okay 
[17:09] augustl: it's a unit test for a system where I open a request, and leave the request open for any amount of time until I have data for the client
[17:10] dingomanatee: That seems pretty wasteful
[17:10] dingomanatee: I mean if the server goes down and up again while you are sitting there not doing anything, why would you care?
[17:10] dominictarr has joined the channel
[17:10] dingomanatee: Also that ties up the server unnecessarily. 
[17:11] dingomanatee: In production, the fewer concurrent connections you leave open the better. 
[17:11] dingomanatee: It seems to me the whole premise is an antipattern. 
[17:11] augustl: it's a sensible approach for the system I'm building
[17:12] dingomanatee: okay - given that - sending useless data and getting a response is the best test I can think of. 
[17:12] dingomanatee: Just send a "Hey there!" packet every few seconds and wait for the resopnse. 
[17:13] dingomanatee: I wouldn't assume that any given lag is an absolute indication of a broken connection, but the number of handshake requests "In play" at any given time is a pretty good predictor. 
[17:14] dingomanatee: Run this system over time and you will get a pretty good indication of how many un-returned requests indicate a broken connection. Though you might find that sending the request to a broken connection generates an error anyway which satisfies your premise. 
[17:14] dingomanatee: ACTION needs to ROCK SxSW! shine on noders.
[17:14] augustl: it's for a utility system that will typically have at most 10 connections
[17:14] augustl: not a public user facing thing
[17:14] dingomanatee: fair enough. 
[17:15] augustl: and the biggest constraint is browsers - gotta use HTTP for XHR requests.
[17:15] Wizek_ has joined the channel
[17:15] dingomanatee: Why not have the server itself tell you every half second how many open connections it has?
[17:15] dingomanatee: If you don't hear from the server its probably dead. 
[17:15] augustl: that doesn't sound like a sensible unit test

[20:16] jetienne: V1: i run a free service on top of socket.io. the cross browser compat was a key factor in the decision process. so i would say go ahead :)
[20:17] Ond: I've never had Opera run in flashsocket mode by the way
[20:17] Ond: It's always been long poling
[20:17] Ond: polling * 
[20:17] Wizek has joined the channel
[20:18] V1: Opera 8+ is shipping with support for "event-source" which allows data to be pushed from the server, which makes it a good alternative for a transport.
[20:18] V1: Ond: I just recently re-enabled the Flashsocket support in Opera. It was disabled because the fallback was to buggy
[20:18] Ond: Ahh
[20:19] jetienne: V1: opera got no eta for websocket support?
[20:19] jetienne: well with sec bug, i guess they are no more in a rush
[20:19] jesusabdullah: Does Opera have a more fasters js implementation yet?
[20:19] Ond: Opera's JS engine isn't bad
[20:19] V1: jetienne: It's build in, but disabled by default.. They would probably enable it again after the WebSocket spec has been updated to squash out the security bugs. 
[20:20] jesusabdullah: Really? I remember it being slow :( Then again I was comparing it to chrome
[20:20] jetienne: V1: oh ok, not a bad state then
[20:20] dustinwhittle has joined the channel
[20:21] jetienne: V1: btw can you provide recomendation on the remember : false option
[20:21] jetienne: V1: im puzzled on "should i remember or not" in my service
[20:22] V1: jetienne: setting the rememberTransport option to false would increase the initial connection duration as it will run through all transports in search of a working transport
[20:22] jetienne: V1: remember:false is what i got from the chat demo i think
[20:23] jetienne: V1: so do you suggest i leave remember to its default ?
[20:23] V1: So if you enable rememberTransport the nexttime the user visits your page they will not have to go through the process. And ye the rememberTransport:false options is indeed set in the chat example

[20:42] Riichard: is webworkers really the right way to do it?
[20:43] jetienne: Riichard: for node ? yep webworker is a good way
[20:43] Riichard: I just need to do one single thread of operations on a loop
[20:43] jetienne: so why do you care about threading :)
[20:45] Riichard: I want to run a gameloop to do ai
[20:45] Riichard: and realtime effects :)
[20:45] jetienne: Riichard: you dont need threading for that
[20:45] jetienne: Riichard: events and all does this well
[20:46] Riichard: Yah, i was wondering of setTimeout would be alright
[20:46] jetienne: setTimeout is only part of it
[20:46] jetienne: you got event on message from socket/iframe
[20:46] jetienne: you got your own event emitter
[20:47] jetienne: Riichard: im writing a game too. i even wrote an microevent emitter just for it
[20:47] Riichard: I basically want to simulate something completely serverside independent of there being any clients attached at all

[20:48] Riichard: microevent?
[20:48] charlenopires has joined the channel
[20:50] jetienne: Riichard: a bit like eventemitter in node, but compatible to node and browser
[20:50] jetienne: and simpler.

[20:50] jetienne: https://github.com/jeromeetienne/microevent.js/blob/master/microevent.js
[20:50] jesusabdullah: I wouldn't mind writing a game, but there's a lot that goes into them!
[20:50] jetienne: not yet completed nor officially published
[20:51] Riichard: jetienne: what are the advantages of microevents over typical observer patterns? just easier to write?
[20:51] jetienne: https://github.com/jeromeetienne/jsbattle/blob/master/lib/microevent.js is actually my real version. merge+doc will happen before actual release
[20:52] davidwalsh has joined the channel
[20:52] jetienne: Riichard: event emitter works well for node. i just wanted a version which was simple and node+browser support
[20:52] Riichard: Gotcha :) so it can be used with or without node?
[20:52] jetienne: Riichard: as a side effect i understood .prototype :) and thisis big :)
[20:52] jetienne: yep
[20:52] Riichard: Neat :)
[20:53] Riichard: I'm planning to use webgl and jetienne for a game

[21:38] marcello3d: o_O
[21:38] jetienne: marcello3d: what do you mean by micro version ?
[21:39] marcello3d: like should I release a new version on npm, or just leave it as a source-only change for now

[21:39] Gigawatt: thanks konobi
[21:39] jetienne: marcello3d: ah ok, well did you had features ? how important they are ? is this a bug fix release
[21:40] Gigawatt: another thing, whats wrong with this
[21:40] marcello3d: konobi: ? D:
[21:40] marcello3d: what do you suggest?
[21:40] konobi: marcello3d: large and numerous events occuring where mongodb totally and irreversibly corrupts your data
[21:40] Gigawatt: if(false === (request instanceof http.ClientRequest))
[21:41] Gigawatt: should it be aserver request ?
[21:41] konobi: 4sq was down for 3 days due to that, for example
[21:41] marcello3d: that's the only example I'm familiar with
[21:41] marcello3d: and that's with older versions of mongodb?
[21:41] konobi: marcello3d: we've seen lots of it with customers, even on newer versions
[21:41] marcello3d: the fact that 4sq is still using it (and looking to switch everything to mongodb) has to mean something

[21:44] dominictarr has joined the channel
[21:44] konobi: marcello3d: it can be persistent too
[21:45] marcello3d: and are these inherently better than mongodb? or are fewer people using them, and thus fewer chances for large failures?
[21:45] V1: redis can backup sync to disk once in a while
[21:45] marcello3d: v1: that's not a database, then :)
[21:45] marcello3d: var db = {} can be sync to disk once in a while, too!

[21:46] konobi: marcello3d: http://redis.io/topics/persistence
[21:46] marcello3d: do they support querying like sql/mongodb, or are you on your own?
[21:46] mraleph: apparently v8monkey is at earliest stages of development… I was a bit too hasty to create a buzz :-) they have not even implemented ObjectTemplates yet
[21:47] malkomalko: konobi: what cliff's are you referring to with mongo?
[21:47] malkomalko: I'm a big mongo user :D
[21:47] marcello3d: this doesn't sound good at all: "Snapshotting is not very durable. If your computer running Redis stops, your power line fails, or you accidentally kill -9 your instance, the latest data written on Redis will get lost. While this may not be a big deal for some applications, there are use cases for full durability, and in these cases Redis was not a viable option."
[21:47] konobi: malkomalko: see above
[21:47] marcello3d: that sounds like redis is even worse than mongodb!
[21:47] konobi: marcello3d: then see below... appendlog
[21:47] malkomalko: are you referring to single server fault recovery and the 60 second default window for potential loss of data?
[21:48] marcello3d: konobi: yes, but it says it's not even out yet?
[21:48] marcello3d: ah, misread
[21:48] kuhrt: What is the current best way to work with mongoDB via nodejs? I've been using mongoose but am finding it a terrible experience so far

[21:50] V1: marcello3d: NoSQL data base has it pro's and cons. 
[21:50] eventi: mongodb also doesn't suck
[21:50] marcello3d: malkomalko: is your layer online somewhere?
[21:50] Gigawatt: you know when you do string.split("/"); it would return an array of 2 empty strings, as im splitting an uri, is there anyway to ['',''] and just get []
[21:50] malkomalko: I built it for a project I'm using, I'm working on pulling it out and will put it on github probably within the next week or so
[21:50] malkomalko: I'll let you know when it's up
[21:51] V1: What I really like about redis is that is really fast, like idiotic fast :) and it supports pubsubhubbub
[21:51] marcello3d: malkomalko: if you get a chance, check out my mongolian library. I just put it up a week or two ago and looking for feedback
[21:52] marcello3d: V1: yea, the pubsub thing sounds super useful
[21:52] marcello3d: for clustering node instances
[21:52] malkomalko: marcello3d: looks very lean, mine is pretty similar.. want me to gist up a couple of examples of the api?
[21:53] marcello3d: sure
[21:53] MrTopf has joined the channel
[21:53] marcello3d: mongolian prettymuch ignores most of the mongodb-native api and just uses the raw connection/bson code

[21:54] marcello3d: V1: little low level for my tastes :D

[21:57] darshanshankar: v1 interesting...can you tell me more about ipc?
[21:58] marcello3d: the reason I'm not using their api is it's super bloated, and would have made my code much more complicated
[21:58] jetienne: V1: they pass fd thru sockets no ?
[21:58] marcello3d: mongolian is pretty lightweight in terms of LoC
[21:58] V1: jetienne:  yes
[21:58] malkomalko: I don't think it's that bloated, I just didn't like the chained nature
[21:58] SubStack: marcello3d: dnode!
[21:58] jetienne: V1: to pass fd thru socket is no unix :)
[21:58] jetienne: is SO unix
[21:59] marcello3d: SubStack: I'm waiting for dmesh :D
[21:59] SubStack: marcello3d: using the reconnect option is pretty close

[22:00] redmind has joined the channel
[22:00] marcello3d: I don't want to designate hierarchy
[22:01] SubStack: marcello3d: then the clients try to reconnect until it comes back up
[22:01] SubStack: you don't really need a hierarchy
[22:01] SubStack: just tie stuff to each other
[22:01] V1: darshanshankar: It's IPC is not so special, it just various of nodes communicating with each other :p
[22:01] SubStack: also reconnect in dnode v0.5 is broken so use v0.6
[22:01] marcello3d: SubStack: I guess it's just autoconfiguration that I'd like
[22:01] floby1 has joined the channel
[22:02] SubStack: I'm not certain that it's actually difficult enough to warrant autoconfiguration
[22:02] SubStack: perhaps just a blog post
[22:02] marcello3d: that's fine
[22:02] marcello3d: it'd be badass though
[22:03] SubStack: oh maybe I could just make dmesh something really simple to keep a registry of all the connected systems
[22:03] SubStack: and then each node could establish its own connections
[22:03] SubStack: role-based
[22:03] V1: SubStack: Socket.io also has a reconnect method.
[22:03] marcello3d: yea. maybe some shared key system, so you know you're talking to the right process
[22:04] SubStack: V1: this is for backend tcp streams
[22:04] V1: Ah okay
[22:04] SubStack: oh right, keys!
[22:04] SubStack: I want dnode to have an ssh transport
[22:04] marcello3d: now you're talking :D
[22:04] SubStack: and since I'm already building that
[22:04] SubStack: might as well
[22:04] SubStack: ssh is so awesome
[22:04] bentruyman has joined the channel
[22:05] SubStack: it has multiple channel transport, tunnels, encryption, compression
[22:05] Gigawatt: i got a question
[22:05] Ond: present it
[22:05] marcello3d: ssh has encryption!? D:
[22:05] SubStack: user/pass or key-based auth too
[22:05] Gigawatt: if i had an array with 5 indexes, and i do > delete variable[0]
[22:05] SubStack: dnode+ssh will be such win
[22:05] foober2 has joined the channel
[22:05] Gigawatt: will they reorder so that the index 1 becomes 0 ?
[22:05] SubStack: Gigawatt: you want splice
[22:05] marcello3d: no
[22:06] SubStack: or slice with assignment
[22:06] Gigawatt: i take it that this is a "feature" :)
[22:06] marcello3d: js supports sparse arrays
[22:06] SubStack: js: var xs = 'abcdef'.split(''); xs.slice(1)
[22:06] gbot2: SubStack: ["b","c","d","e","f"]
[22:06] SubStack: js: var xs = 'abcdef'.split(''); xs.splice(0,1); xs
[22:06] gbot2: SubStack: ["b","c","d","e","f"]
[22:06] SubStack: one of those
[22:06] marcello3d: so if you do var array = []; array[10000000000] = 'b',  it won't allocate a shitload of memory
[22:07] SubStack: arrays are actually just objects
[22:07] SubStack: except when they're not
[22:07] marcello3d: SubStack: sort of
[22:07] marcello3d: hah
[22:07] Gigawatt: good point about the memory, so the tip is that i splice after delete!
[22:07] marcello3d: or don't even delete
[22:07] SubStack: splice removes elements
[22:07] marcello3d: slice returns a new array
[22:07] marcello3d: and what he said
[22:07] marcello3d: I gotta go
[22:07] marcello3d: piece.

[22:55] Lion2Leo: V1: I must be doing something wrong, I started using node 3 days ago
[22:55] Lion2Leo: V1: What do you mean by that? Don't messages sent from the client should get transmitted to the server?
[22:56] V1: Lion2Leo: There's probably one really small bug somewhere :p but I don't see it.. 
[22:57] V1: Well on your server you have 'on message from the client, broad cast that message' so the server will only send a message to you when you send it something first
[22:57] simb: Lion2Leo: where is your logging setup . the snippet doesnt have any console stuff in it.
[22:57] Lion2Leo: V1: Does reloading the page affect var socket = new io.Socket('localhost', {port: 3333});
[22:57] V1: I doubt it Lion2Leo 
[22:57] simb: Lion2Leo: reloading the page will get you a new client connection and redo the handshake, but i wouldnt expect it to change much.
[22:58] Lion2Leo: simb: What logging set up?
[22:58] pascalopitz: sorry guys, late to the party ... Lion: Do you expect the server to broadcast to all OTHER connected users?
[22:58] Lion2Leo: Yes
[22:58] pascalopitz: in that case use client.broadcast
[22:58] simb: Sorry you said there was duplicate output to the console. so I figured there was something etup to do that.
[22:58] Lion2Leo: It's not working
[22:59] pascalopitz: socket.broadcast sends it back to the sender as well
[22:59] Lion2Leo: simb: I did console.log(message) and I saw the client message three times

[23:16] coderdude: hmmm interesting... so basically i'm just approaching it wrong. is there an easy way to accomplish what i wanted to do? as in, just a simple function that returns a list of items from a database? or is the "right" way to do it as a callback?
[23:16] Gigawatt: thats direct from --version
[23:17] Lion2Leo: simb: Hmm
[23:17] simb: Lion2Leo: i installed express and ejs
[23:17] Lion2Leo: simb: I have no idea, I did npm install express ejs connect

[23:17] Gigawatt: pascalopitz: v0.4.2
[23:17] simb: I'd guess that would be all I needed but no such luck
[23:17] ParadoxQuine: coderdude: callback. if you *really* want to write it in sync style you could use streamline.js

[23:18] stepheneb has joined the channel
[23:18] Gigawatt: ahhh that old chestnut,

[23:22] tbranyen: actually shit context isn't set in a forEach callback
[23:22] tbranyen: need to do forEach(function( key ) { console.log( obj[key] ); })
[23:22] Gigawatt: tbranyen: its an array, not an object though
[23:22] tbranyen: Gigawatt: oh haha
[23:22] datapimp has joined the channel

[23:23] tmzt_: SubStack: do either dnode or nowjs solve the problem of needing to wrap all the even callbacks (like jquery event callbacks) in the initial call?

[23:27] SubStack: tmzt_: dnode doesn't come baked in with flow control itself, no
[23:27] SubStack: doesn't seem like nowjs does either
[23:27] SubStack: tmzt_: however with browserify you can just require() your favorite flow-control lib from npm browser-side
[23:27] SubStack: and dnode v0.6 works with browserify out of the box
[23:28] tbranyen: Gigawatt: swap out forEach with map then

[23:42] tmzt_: SubStack: that's not what I'm asking at all, I mean if I want a button on the page to call something through dnode the jquery code that binds the buttons has to be wrapped in the DNode call
[23:42] tmzt_: otherwise the inner function doesn't get a valid server object
[23:43] tmzt_: I've tried using globals and everything else, it didn't work
[23:43] tmzt_: by global I mean something scoped outside of the callback
[23:44] SubStack: it doesn't seem like nowjs lets you make symmetric requests like you can in dnode
