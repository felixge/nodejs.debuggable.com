[00:23] te-brian has joined the channel
[00:23] brainproxy: don't use global namespaces -- use dependency injection; don't use a "global" require-paths approach to load modules in your app; rather install what you need "next to" your app in node_modules
[00:24] rhdoenges has joined the channel
[00:24] brainproxy: and in turn the stuff in node_modules won't look to a global warehouse of modules for their deps, but will look in their own node_modules
[00:25] thepatr1ck: we weren't using it requiring installable modules, but to simplify paths for internal (to the "app") modules
[00:25] zanes: brainproxy: Are there good DI frameworks for V8 javascript? 
[00:25] thepatr1ck: and the docs for v0.5.2: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.5.2/api/globals.html#require.paths 
[00:25] brainproxy: zanes: it seems to develop naturally if you pass around functions, which are objects in js
[00:26] brainproxy: check out the server+router+handler example in the Node Beginner Book .. fairly inspiring actually :)

[00:59] eboyjr: rook2pawn: Okay so its that simple?

[01:00] rook2pawn: eboyjr: its a very symmetric design, and of course, only functions asynchronously
[01:01] cloudhead4 has joined the channel
[01:01] eboyjr: ah, neat
[01:02] rook2pawn: eboyjr: dnode({wrapper}).listen(ip:port,application) where wrapper is either an object of rpc offerings or a function that takes an implicit remote object and connection emitter

[01:03] MarkMenard has joined the channel
[01:03] SubStack: *shanebo
[01:03] eboyjr: rook2pawn: thanks
[01:03] SubStack: or connect.createServer(connect.static(__dirname + '/static')) does the same thing
[01:03] cloudhead5 has joined the channel
[01:03] SubStack: then connect has a router you can use as middleware too
[01:04] SubStack: server.use(connect.router(function (app) { ... }))

[01:05] shanebo: SubStack, something like this? and put my router code in the anon func?

[01:06] cloudhead6 has joined the channel
[01:06] SubStack: shanebo: I prefer explicitly calling .use() but that works too
[01:06] SubStack: middlewares are just function (req, res, next) {}
[01:07] SubStack: calling next() causes the next middleware in the stack to fire
[01:07] tshpaper has joined the channel
[01:08] shanebo: so if there was another few functions in there, I'd pass next into it and call it at the end of the function?

[01:17] isaacs: sephr: there's a git push deploy PaaS for cobol, have you heard of it?
[01:17] sephr: yeah
[01:17] isaacs: it's fer srsly.  not a joke.

[01:19] jesusabdullah: it's source code
[01:19] eboyjr: sephr: you used to work for myspace, right?
[01:19] sephr: shhh
[01:19] isaacs: jonaslund: sort of.  what's up?
[01:19] jesusabdullah: *anything* you've written in cobol
[01:19] Nexxy: jesusabdullah, prescription*
[01:19] jonaslund: isaacs: what os do you use mostly ?
[01:20] isaacs: jonaslund: os x snow leopard and SmartOS
[01:20] sephr: eboyjr: how goes that node.js OS you've been working on?
[01:20] jesusabdullah: Nexxy's right, you know! I need an Rx of example cobol stat!
[01:20] jesusabdullah: Nexxy: Good call. :)
[01:20] jonaslund: isaacs: ok. used any chm based manuals ?
[01:20] isaacs: ?
[01:20] isaacs: dunno what that is
[01:20] jonaslund: or  got a viewer 
[01:20] sephr: I ran some 3d games on node.jsOS wine port
[01:20] isaacs: what's chm?
[01:20] rhdoenges: isn't that like the windows help format?
[01:20] eboyjr: sephr: ah its' pretty good! me and my team are finished with the task scheduling! so almost done with the kernel
[01:20] sephr: only getting 100fps
[01:20] jonaslund: chm is compiled html.. used by microsoft for programming manuals
[01:20] sephr: I expected better
[01:20] rhdoenges: knew it
[01:20] jonaslund: one compressed file
[01:20] sephr: like at least 120fps
[01:20] isaacs: jonaslund: oh, no, i haven't.
[01:20] jonaslund: with a toc and index
[01:21] Nexxy: is anyone here speaking @ OSCon?
[01:21] Nexxy: if so, I have a bucket for you
[01:21] jonaslund: isaacs: anyhow, i made a markdown -> chm conversion tool on saturday

[01:21] cloudhead12 has joined the channel
[01:21] sephr: I'm speaking there
[01:21] Nexxy: no just trying to figure out how I can get on the guest list or something ;3
[01:21] jonaslund: isaacs: it's pretty good apart from that i noticed that the manual headings have a bit "funny" levels (i saw your manual checkins so i thought you had some idea about the manual)
[01:21] sephr: heh
[01:21] eboyjr: sephr: also the memory management is hard to do with v8 :/ but with some external asm-v8 bindings it makes it nicer
[01:22] boehm has joined the channel
[01:22] sephr: upgrade to v9
[01:22] sephr: it's the plan9 of v8
[01:22] jonaslund: isaacs: f.ex. the main "File System" heading is h2 (##) , then the fs. functions are h3
[01:22] rhdoenges: a V9 would be terribly imbalanced and throw your car around funny
[01:22] rhdoenges: how about V12
[01:22] jonaslund: isaacs: but then the fs.ReadStream and fs.WriteStream "classes" are h2 again
[01:22] isaacs: jonaslund: yeah, i just follow what's there.
[01:22] eboyjr: sephr: never heard of it.
[01:22] sephr: my car's microprocessors all use v9, rhdoenges
[01:23] isaacs: jonaslund: didnt' design that
[01:23] eboyjr: my car is a rhino
[01:23] sephr: they forced me into only 5 accidents so far
[01:23] jonaslund: isaacs: so the topic structure becomes kinda weird (you can spot the same problem in the single page html)
[01:23] eboyjr: its a lot easier than driving a spider-monkey half-breed
[01:23] jonaslund: isaacs: k, ryan ?
[01:23] rhdoenges: my car's microprocessors run jagermonkey, sephr

[01:23] isaacs: jonaslund: if you have some ideas for making the docs better, please email the nodejs-dev list.
[01:24] rhdoenges: is the readline module still mostly undocumented?
[01:24] sephr: elliottcable: so on your node.js dissertation; how did it go?
[01:24] jonaslund: isaacs: well, i wouldn't necessarily (in a sense it's good that the "classes" have a higher level)
[01:24] elliottcable: sephr: hm?
[01:24] sephr: eboyjr said you doing something funny here
[01:24] sephr: ACTION needs to know
[01:24] rhdoenges: I told myself I would write docs last week but oh well
[01:25] jonaslund: isaacs: change the thing, MS own manuals f.ex. often has similarly grouped items divded into a "functions" and "classes" subheadings.. it's just that the markdown has no distinction about those things (apart from heading levels)
[01:25] jonaslund: isaacs: but then there's other non class/function topics in the manual aswell

[01:30] Nexxy: jonaslund, are you from academia?

[01:31] jonaslund: I'm not propsing changes
[01:31] elliottcable: the Scheme R6RS specification is pretty amazingly well done
[01:31] jonaslund: but the docs are made in a way that allows us to generate it into different formats
[01:31] jonaslund: and i personally love using chm manuals
[01:32] jonaslund: and i'm pretty sure i'm not the only one
[01:32] eboyjr: lol chm? that's windows right?
[01:32] Nexxy: lol chm
[01:32] tbranyen: there are chm readers in Linux as well
[01:32] eboyjr: l.o.l.
[01:32] jonaslund: there are 2-3 chm readers for osX
[01:32] tbranyen: chm is actually pretty great
[01:32] Nexxy: I remember the chm exploit days!
[01:32] tbranyen: jonaslund: you could probably generate your own
[01:32] jonaslund: tbranyen: i already generated a CHM for the node docs
[01:33] tbranyen: beautiful
[01:33] jonaslund: tbranyen: the structure isn't that pretty yet sadly
[01:33] tbranyen: which version?
[01:33] ggg: tbranyen, has much I find node.js interesting, its hard to focus somewhere, there is so many duplicates of effort, its difficult to choose the best option, in the hope of developing something that works well, and that the source code wont change every 5 days

[01:35] sephr: it's so efficient
[01:35] sephr: and lightweight
[01:35] tbranyen: thats surprising
[01:35] eboyjr: its not as slow as a turtle as some people might have led you to believe
[01:35] elliottcable: Node.jOS-Whedon
[01:36] jonaslund: tbranyen: i'm not certain yet about if i should keep big sections or let each heading become it's own small topic
[01:36] elliottcable: Fox is gonna cancel it in a season though
[01:36] elliottcable: so don’t get too excited
[01:36] cloudhead18 has joined the channel
[01:36] tbranyen: no they gotta wait till they start getting a following
[01:36] tbranyen: then cancel
[01:36] jonaslund: and i shortened prefixed things
[01:36] jonaslund: so "fs.writeFileSync" becomes writeFileSync in the index
[01:36] tbranyen: oh
[01:36] eboyjr: tbranyen: yeah i have multithreading with process.nextTick, its surprisingly fast
[01:37] jonaslund: (not yet sure if it's a good idea though)
[01:37] tbranyen: yeah i don't think that is a good idea
[01:37] tbranyen: jonaslund: since you arent' creating an instance of fs
[01:37] tbranyen: its just an object

[01:38] sephr: this should be able to run google earth at 60fps on a vaccuum
[01:38] jonaslund: tbranyen: yeah exactly.. the function name seemed more important than the "context"
[01:38] jonaslund: tbranyen: then again if there's clashes it might be troublesome

[01:39] sephr: from the human brain
[01:39] jonaslund: tbranyen: right now f.ex. write only points to buffer.write eventhough there's stream.write
[01:39] tbranyen: hmmm
[01:39] jonaslund: tbranyen: gotta see if you can have multi-entry indexes (i know MSDN has those)
[01:40] jonaslund: this was just a few hours hack so well.. :)
[01:40] jonaslund: and typing fs.writeFileSync would give more context (since you'd see all the FS entries at the same time)
[01:40] jonaslund: however then you could just go for the contents instead of looking at the index

[01:55] cccaldas has joined the channel
[01:55] eboyjr: sephr: you can use the process.stdout.write() function to write to stdout
[01:55] perezd has joined the channel
[01:55] sephr: yeah but how do I output a number?????
[01:55] sephr: you're not helping
[01:56] eboyjr: it should typecast what you put in and convert to a stirng to its human readable
[01:56] cloudhead26 has joined the channel
[01:56] sephr: yeah but I have a number and that doesn't really matter
[01:56] sephr: like how come there's no dollar sign before it?
[01:56] sephr: and way too many decimal places eboyjr
[01:56] eboyjr: due to ecma's complex rules, anything you pass to process.stdout.write is first checked if it has a toString method applied
[01:56] elliottcable: sephr: Are you using jQuery?
[01:56] sephr: yeah
[01:57] eboyjr: sephr: do you know how to make a toString method?
[01:57] elliottcable: sephr: the dollar sign is a jQuery thing. This channel can’t help you with dollar signs, try #jQuery
[01:57] sephr: how would I give a number a method?
[01:57] sephr: elliottcable: I only use jquery for the math
[01:57] sephr: I need to fix this right now
[01:57] eboyjr: sephr: well if it is a instance of the number object (constructed with new Number) then you can do it
[01:57] elliottcable: sephr: try the standard Math module.
[01:58] sephr: my boss will kill me if tha banking site is down any more
[01:58] eboyjr: …
[01:58] sephr: how do I import the standard module?
[01:58] elliottcable: ACTION is disturbed that this guy is running a banking site
[01:58] sephr: do I import std.math?
[01:58] sephr: elliottcable: no it's safe
[01:58] sephr: we have 2 pin numbers
[01:58] sephr: one is your account pin number
[01:58] sephr: the other is your password pin number
[01:58] eboyjr: sephr: ecma script defines the standard Math object that is built in to all conforming implementations
[01:58] sephr: secure
[01:58] cloudhead27 has joined the channel
[01:58] sephr: I verify it with java scripts
[01:58] elliottcable: sephr: is your banking website’s JavaScript implementation conformant?
[01:58] sephr: on the web page
[01:59] sephr: yeah I checked it myself
[01:59] eboyjr: sephr: what's your node.js version?
[01:59] sephr: updated it yesterday
[01:59] eboyjr: to what?
[01:59] sephr: 0.4.10
[01:59] elliottcable: okay, you need to update to 5.2
[01:59] eboyjr: that should* have the proper Math object, but I cannot cofirm
[02:00] eboyjr: I don't have 0.4.10 available for testing
[02:00] shanebo: is 5.2 stable?
[02:00] tmzt_: sephr: you can find code to print a number as fixed decimals pretty easily, usually in some hacky way that's cross broser
[02:00] elliottcable: if you can’t do it with the Math object, you could write a custom C extension to do it
[02:00] eboyjr: elliottcable: are you sure he should be running a banking site with unstable software?
[02:00] eboyjr: Oh yeah! good idea
[02:00] elliottcable: I’ve never written a Node plugin though :x
[02:00] MarkMenard has joined the channel
[02:00] elliottcable: sephr: are you familiar with C++?
[02:01] eboyjr: sephr: you can use the node plugin C++ api
[02:01] mehtryx has joined the channel
[02:01] elliottcable: sephr: go play with the V8 APIs
[02:01] eboyjr: that will give you maximum flexibility with printing numbers
[02:01] cloudhead28 has joined the channel
[02:01] tmzt_: ??
[02:02] sephr: elliottcable: ok back
[02:02] eboyjr: sephr: if you want to do it the was tmzt_ is suggesting, there are the common Number.prototype.toFixed methods that you will find handy
[02:02] sephr: I updated to 0.5.2
[02:02] eboyjr: sephr: no. no.no.
[02:02] sephr: tmzt_: I can't use browser javascript for that
[02:02] sephr: it's too late to document.write :(
[02:02] eboyjr: sephr: you need to use the stable version
[02:02] sephr: so I need to do it from node.js
[02:02] eboyjr: sephr: uninstall and reinstall 0.4.9
[02:03] tmzt_: like this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/149055/how-can-i-format-numbers-as-money-in-javascript/149099#149099
[02:03] eboyjr: i mean 0.4.10
[02:03] tmzt_: just take out the $ if you don't need it
[02:03] sephr: ok I keep one backup that I delete every day
[02:03] sephr: reverted to backup
[02:03] eboyjr: tmzt_: ah, good link

[02:04] elliottcable: tmzt_: oh gods don’t ask that, he might answer it
[02:04] tmzt_: per file?
[02:05] sephr: no we use notepad so it has tons of ctrl+zing
[02:05] sephr: it's safe
[02:05] sephr: please help me with my problem though
[02:05] sephr: I can't output the numbers
[02:05] tmzt_: few versions of notepad even have an undo queue
[02:05] tmzt_: I did
[02:05] elliottcable: I don’t even remember what your actual problem was …
[02:05] sephr: also I guess I should mention they need to be in sortable tables
[02:05] tmzt_: that code works on node.js as well as the browser
[02:05] elliottcable: you want to do the sorting serverside, in Node?
[02:06] eboyjr: tmzt_: well you can only undo 3 times in notepad :/
[02:06] sephr: elliottcable: yeah please tell me how to do it
[02:06] eboyjr: er that's mspaint

[02:06] sephr: I'll give you the password to our banking site's ftp
[02:06] sephr: ok I pmed you it
[02:06] eboyjr: sephr: okay do you have the number in a variable? if so, what is the variable name?
[02:07] sephr: it's nums
[02:07] sephr: I used an advanced technology
[02:07] tmzt_: dump it to json and read it with jqgrid
[02:07] sephr: where I can push numbers onto an array
[02:07] tmzt_: only ryan has @ right?
[02:07] sephr: which I am told is like a list of variables
[02:07] eboyjr: sephr: Try process.stdout.write("$"+nums.toFixed(2))
[02:07] brownies has joined the channel
[02:07] eboyjr: sephr: what do you get?

[02:07] sephr: arrays can't have methods silly
[02:07] sephr: even I know that
[02:08] tbranyen: banhammer
[02:08] tmzt_: no, but prototypes can
[02:08] tbranyen: bring it on
[02:08] eboyjr: sephr: O_O it's an array?
[02:08] eboyjr: sephr: i thought you said it was a number :(
[02:08] sephr: yeah I learned about arrays a week ago in school
[02:08] sephr: it's like a phone book
[02:08] sephr: according to the teacher
[02:08] sephr: it makes no sense

[02:31] isaacs: eboyjr: you're not required to do anything you don't want to do :)
[02:31] isaacs: eboyjr: to publish a module, you can use the `npm publish` command.
[02:31] isaacs: but you don't *have* to publish anything
[02:31] isaacs: it just makes it easier to install that same program on other systems.
[02:32] eboyjr: isaacs: i head that in the node.js license you had to
[02:32] eboyjr: okay i'll look at npm publish, i want to publish it anyway
[02:32] isaacs: eboyjr: no, if you want to use "node" in the name of your module, and distribute it, then you have to publish it with npm, so that it's clear that it doesnt' come from joyent.
[02:33] elliottcable: … that seems, er, odd
[02:33] elliottcable: isaacs: why would it seem to come from joyent if that werent the case?
[02:33] SubStack: because joyent would /never/ publish anything to npm!
[02:33] elliottcable: don’t mistake me for being a dick, I’m genuinely curious
[02:33] eboyjr: yeah that's god to know
[02:33] cloudhead41 has joined the channel
[02:33] eboyjr: good*
[02:33] SubStack: joyent has their OWN npm I bet
[02:33] isaacs: elliottcable: compared with the fact that you simply may not use "apache" or "php" in the name of a program you distribute without explicit written permission, it's actually quite 
[02:34] isaacs: *quite open
[02:34] elliottcable: isaacs: I mean, oh, I’m completely okay with it
[02:34] elliottcable: i	not *complaining*, just trying to figure out the logic.

[02:36] eboyjr: SubStack: join the bandwagon!
[02:36] isaacs: elliottcable: joyent wants to protect the trademark on "Node.js".  if joyent allows just anyone to distribute just anything under that name, then anyone can show up and say "Well, you let that dude use it, so i should be able to use "node.js" to advertise my program that has nothing to do with your node.js thing."

[02:38] isaacs: elliottcable: well, more like, having some restrictions that make it clear what comes directly from joyent as part of the project, and what is not directly affiliated with the project, makes it enforceable.

[02:41] gkatsev: openoffice

[02:41] elliottcable: or bug-suite or something?

[02:41] eboyjr: Jenkins?
[02:42] gkatsev: continuous-intergration server
[02:42] gkatsev: as elliottcable said
[02:42] tmzt_: but those went to apache?
[02:42] gkatsev: it was originally called hudson
[02:42] elliottcable: was it actually a CI server? :O
[02:42] elliottcable: oh my! I remembered something!
[02:42] isaacs: elliottcable: well, forking and renaming is sort of a nuclear option for an open source project.  but yes, if ryan and felix and me and mikeal and everybody else (but mostly ryan) were really all in agreement that something terrible was being done to the mark, Joyent would have more to lose than we would, and we could fork and rename.  but while companies do sometimes turn evil, Joyent's not dumb.
[02:43] gkatsev: elliottcable: yes

[03:09] tmzt_: it's supposed to, but only if you have a function name parameter I think
[03:09] jamescarr: wtf
[03:09] tmzt_: or use getScript
[03:09] tbranyen: jamescarr: it does, but thats not what backbone uses under the hood

[03:47] domo: I see

[03:48] domo: alrighty
[03:48] domo: cool
[03:48] gkatsev: eboyjr: no, mongo

[03:48] Nexxy: s/mongo/riak/
[03:48] tmzt_: like printing numbers?
[03:48] Nexxy: domo, mongoose is neat!
[03:48] Nexxy: if you like schemas
[03:48] isaacs: Nexxy: well, my guess (also *guess*) is that the diff would probably show up if you were doing something where the DB itself wasn't the bottleneck.
[03:48] Nexxy: since you're using mysql you might find that handy
[03:48] domo: well I've used mongo plenty
[03:48] tmzt_: Nexxy: you can use mongoose and ignore the schemes too, just use User.collection.
[03:48] domo: I just turned to mysql since this project has a lot of relation data
[03:48] domo: relational *
[03:49] gkatsev: Nexxy: s/riak/redis/ ?

[03:54] domo: so I don't understand, with all of these node.js + <some db lib> it seems you need to wrap your code in the database's callback for when the connection is ready
[03:55] SubStack: domo: that's how async io works
[03:55] eboyjr: yup, its called asyncronosity
[03:55] domo: so the answer is yes
[03:55] eboyjr: so you can do something else before it connects
[03:55] domo: there's no way I can halt until the connnection is ready?
[03:55] domo: no no I understand
[03:55] domo: but what if I don't want to do anything before it connects
[03:55] domo: if the app I'm writing requires a connection?
[03:57] Sami_ZzZ_ has joined the channel
[03:59] strcK has joined the channel
[03:59] tmzt_: halt?
[03:59] tmzt_: first of all, mongoose can handle the connection not being avaiable, it will actually perform the operations when it is
[03:59] eboyjr: he doesn't to use callbacks
[03:59] eboyjr: doesn't want*
[03:59] domo: interesting
[03:59] domo: I didn't know that
[03:59] domo: but db specific aside
[04:00] domo: I want the application to fail if the connection is available
[04:00] domo: er exit *
[04:00] tmzt_: the point of the callback is the code doesn't run if it doesn't become avaiable
[04:00] tmzt_: you can use a setTimeout
[04:00] tmzt_: and just exit the process with an error
[04:00] domo: ok that's what I had in mind
[04:01] eboyjr: domo: http://substack.net/images/dnode-slides/fuck_yeah.png
[04:01] domo: lol
[04:02] domo: no prob with cb's my man just wondering if there was another way besides wrapping a ton of code around a connectionReady({

[06:39] Ancarius: never used mingw and I already have cygwin installed as part of a software package so it seemed like the logical choice

[06:40] rhdoenges: mingw is very different
[06:40] Ancarius: i see :)
[06:40] rhdoenges: tmzt_'s got it

[06:45] Nexxy: or resource locations?
[06:46] tmzt_: Ancarius: you're node program you write is a web server
[06:46] tmzt_: that's it
[06:46] dexter_e: Are there default out of the box differences between Node in prod vs. dev ?
[06:46] tmzt_: then it's listening for requests
[06:46] mikey_p: typicall node stops goofing off and gets ready for SRS BIZNESS
[06:46] rhdoenges: Ancarius: it just gets up and runs!
[06:46] stagas: dexter_e: no afaik
[06:46] dexter_e: what about for Express ?
[06:46] stagas: dexter_e: yes
[06:46] dexter_e: error reporting and caching ?
[06:47] mikey_p: express generally caches views and switches error reporting around, but it's really up to your app
[06:47] Ancarius: so i can just run it on apache?
[06:47] mikey_p: the error reporting is just what it does if you scaffold an app using the generator, you can override it
[06:47] dexter_e: I se
[06:47] dexter_e: so its just caching stuff ?
[06:47] stagas: Ancarius: no, you type 'node yourapp.js' and it runs solo
[06:48] Ancarius: so how do i integerate it on say apache?
[06:48] stagas: Ancarius: you need some kind of proxy, as not both can run on the same port on the same ip
[06:48] Ancarius: or redirect localhost on my browser to it?
[06:49] rhdoenges: Ancarius: you don't.
[06:49] stagas: Ancarius: but better is to run it on a free ip
[06:49] topaxi has joined the channel
[06:49] mikey_p: Ancarius: for local development its better to just run node on some port other than 80
[06:49] rhdoenges: Ancarius: node is designed to serve directly to clients. If you put a big fat apache instance between it and the web you ruin it.
[06:49] mikey_p: express defaults to 3000 for example
[06:50] rhdoenges: 8080 or 3000 or whatever
[06:50] rhdoenges: just try the hello world http server and it will all make sense
[06:50] Ancarius: ok..i might have misspoken. i was curious as to how i go about deploying a node driven http server
[06:51] tmzt_: Ancarius: usually with a lightweight server proxy in front of it, like nginx
[06:51] Fandekasp has joined the channel
[06:51] stagas: Ancarius: if you have a vps w/ cpanel you can do this https://gist.github.com/754303 or you can use one of the node hosting providers like no.de or nodejitsu

[06:55] irrumator_: stagas: it's coming up with other errors so i'm not sure that's alright..
[06:55] rhdoenges: go find 0.4.10 somewhere and keep running that.
[06:55] irrumator_: is 0.5 latest?
[06:56] Ancarius: well ...this all seems a bit more complicated than i anticipated :) still...persistence i guess
[06:56] Ancarius: thanks for your help guys. i think i get the basic idea now
[06:56] rhdoenges: irrumator_: odd minor versions are unstable
[06:56] rhdoenges: it is latest
[06:56] Ancarius: have a nice day everyone
[06:56] rhdoenges: but 0.4 is still receiving patches etc
[06:56] rhdoenges: later, Ancarius!
[06:57] rhdoenges: because 0.4 is stable and good. 0.5 will kidnap your app and sell it for drugs if you aren't careful

[07:07] rachelderp: But then says to test it, run some other command

[14:10] bnoordhuis: KimSchneider: it should work
[14:11] bnoordhuis: KimSchneider: but you can generate a test wildcart cert with openssl if you want to be sure

[15:54] xtianw: i.e. 0.5.x
[15:54] chrisdickinson: blueadept: i like it a lot, personally.
[15:54] exa: chjj: i'm using a form to upload files, if this file contains text, i want to display it :)
[15:55] chrisdickinson: it really speeds up development. the hardest problems to debug usually sprung from not really knowing coffeescript front-to-back when i started.
[15:55] chjj: exa: thers a few ways you could do it, the slowest most expensive way would be to read every byte until you hit a non-ascii one, the fastest way would be to check file extensions, and another way would be to read the first few bytes to check for a png or jpeg header or something, sniff the content type out
[15:55] blueadept: chrisdikson: interesting
[15:56] chrisdickinson: blueadept: it's a relatively big project, an orm -- though now i'm switching from "write the API" to "thoroughly test and fix bugs"
[15:56] jerrysv has joined the channel
[15:56] chjj: i wonder if somebody has written a content type sniffing module
[15:56] chjj: maybe
[15:56] chrisdickinson: coffeescript really speeds up the first half of that equation, and the second half... well, at worst it has no net loss over what i'd be doing if i were writing and debugging using JS.
[15:57] chrisdickinson: really, the hardest part is that some of the libraries i'm depending on have bugs that didn't show up until i started testing in-depth.
[15:57] chrisdickinson: (which is really unrelated to coffeescript)
[15:57] jetienne: chrisdickinson: +1 on dependancies bug

[15:58] chrisdickinson: biggest gripe is that some operators are shared between cs and js but do different things -- the `in` operator acts like python's in CS, while in JS it's a key check.
[15:58] tjholowaychuk has joined the channel
[15:58] jetienne: even if i dont share your opinion on cs
[16:00] chrisdickinson: jetienne: yeah, finding bugs in other libraries is a big pain, doubly so with the callback-passing style.

[16:00] chrisdickinson: there's nothing more lovely than watching your test suite intermittently hang because some 3rd party library forgets to call your callback.
[16:00] jetienne: chrisdickinson: i advocate for a node-libs project in order to limit that a LOT
[16:01] chrisdickinson: jetienne: what form would that take?
[16:01] jetienne: node-libs would be official libs, extensive testing, very well documented
[16:01] jetienne: all other server langauges got it. python/ruby/perl/php etc...
[16:02] chjj: were not all the other server languages
[16:02] chjj: which is a good thing
[16:02] chrisdickinson: something like http://pypants.org/? or http://djangopackages.com/?
[16:02] chjj: saying we need to be more like php and ruby isnt really an argument
[16:02] jetienne: chrisdickinson: no, more like python library, ruby library, php library
[16:02] chrisdickinson: (i'm +1 on the second idea, i'd love a "community rated npm package" site)
[16:02] Swizec has joined the channel
[16:02] jetienne: chjj: their lib and doc are WAY better than ours
[16:02] tjholowaychuk: we dont really need a "stdlib"
[16:03] tjholowaychuk: like that at least, node isn't a language
[16:03] cccaldas has joined the channel
[16:03] jetienne: i need libraries, tested, maintained and documented
[16:03] tjholowaychuk: sure
[16:03] chjj: those exist last time i checked
[16:03] tjholowaychuk: that's different than shoving tons of libs into one repo
[16:03] chrisdickinson: yeah, it's less an issue of having a stdlib, and more an issue of setting up something that enables the community to self-police
[16:04] jetienne: tjholowaychuk: clearly maybe i wasnt clear explaining it
[16:04] tjholowaychuk: i just kinda glanced
[16:04] tjholowaychuk: i agree though, some kind of rating would be nice
[16:04] markmarkoh has joined the channel

[16:06] chrisdickinson: * with "I'm using this repo!" maybe authenticated via the npm registry.

[16:06] chrisdickinson: definitely.
[16:07] chapel: Im sure it would be popular
[16:07] jetienne: here is a good project :)
[16:07] chrisdickinson: also, maybe sort of an "automatic guessed score" based on running "npm test" against the library with code coverage + presence / absence of docs dir.
[16:07] jetienne: linked with github authentication to avoid duplication
[16:07] sambasiva has joined the channel
[16:07] isaacs: chrisdickinson: that is all planned, but someone has to build it

[16:08] jetienne: chrisdickinson: to provide hints on how to improve library doc or other would be nice
[16:08] chapel: jetienne: yeah, definitely github authentication, and links back to github
[16:08] sambasiva: Hi, how can we dump the outgoing message of https?
[16:08] jetienne: sambasiva: ? same as in http
[16:08] tjholowaychuk: chrisdickinson docs dont always live in the repo though
[16:08] chrisdickinson: isaacs: would it be better as a part of npmjs.org instead of a standalone site? or vice versa.
[16:09] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: fine, docs outside the repo = lower score
[16:09] tjholowaychuk: that's kinda lame
[16:09] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: it's better for docs to be with the cod
[16:09] isaacs: *code
[16:09] chjj: yeah it might not be good to create a schism between npm and some other site
[16:09] isaacs: preferrably in a folder called "doc" or "docs"
[16:09] tjholowaychuk: that's all opinions though
[16:09] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: it's patterns.
[16:09] tjholowaychuk: IMO it's better to have docs IN the code
[16:09] tjholowaychuk: but node doesn't etc
[16:09] chapel: chjj: problem is someone has to build it
[16:09] jetienne: this is why i dont want spec :)
[16:09] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: in that case, providing a "build docs" command works.
[16:09] jetienne: people will argue for years on details. i prefere to see running code
[16:10] dexter_e has joined the channel
[16:10] chapel: I do agree that its more important that the code works, than where your docs are
[16:10] tjholowaychuk: yeah you can have an awesome site
[16:10] tjholowaychuk: but get a low score
[16:10] sambasiva: Hi all,  how can we dump the outgoing http/https request including header/body?
[16:10] tjholowaychuk: from not having it in the repo
[16:10] chrisdickinson: there's also the case of people keeping the docs with the repo in the form of a detached branch.
[16:10] tjholowaychuk: cluttering your source
[16:10] chapel: the fact you have docs is a + in my book
[16:10] chapel: as long as you can find them

[16:12] tyrone: I am getting permission denied warnings when running, 'sudo make install' as my final command to install node.js
[16:12] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: the score is not a measure of "how objectively good is this package".  it's a measure of "is this package probably good, based on various heuristics"
[16:12] igl has joined the channel
[16:12] tjholowaychuk: isaacs sure
[16:12] tjholowaychuk: it just doesn't make a whole ton of sense to me
[16:12] xerox: is there in javascript a \w for regexp more unicode-friendly?
[16:12] isaacs: all things being equal, i'd bet on the package with the "doc"  folder
[16:12] tjholowaychuk: it's still super opinionated
[16:13] tjholowaychuk: i'd bet on the one with inline docs
[16:13] isaacs: it's not opinionated.  it's bayesian.
[16:13] chrisdickinson: i like the fact that it's opinionated.

[16:13] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: packages by tj have inline docs.  other packages don't.  some 50-60% of packages have a "doc" folder.
[16:13] jetienne: i could :)
[16:13] chrisdickinson: it shouldn't be hard to find docs -- and if we adjust the heuristics to favor libraries that put it in one well known place, i think everybody wins.
[16:13] kjeldahl has joined the channel
[16:13] chjj: xerox: you could do something like, [\w\u00ff-\uffff]
[16:13] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: doc folders are easier to detect and validate.
[16:14] chjj: not pretty
[16:14] chjj: but it should work
[16:14] isaacs: (either it exists, or it doesn't)
[16:14] xerox: chjj: cool I don't care about prettiness :D
[16:14] tjholowaychuk: easy enough to sniff the source and see if it's documented
[16:14] dherman: if I do stream.on("drain", cb) will cb only receive the *next* drain event, or all subsequent drain events?
[16:14] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: no, it's not as easy.
[16:14] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: that's difficult, though -- what distinguishes a comment intended for devs from a comment meant as documentation?
[16:14] chapel: is there a docs field for package.json?
[16:14] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: nor is it as worthwhile, since almost no one does it.
[16:14] xerox: works like a charm chjj I owe you a beer
[16:15] tjholowaychuk: chrisdickinson doesn't matter really, it shows intent
[16:15] chapel: isaacs?
[16:15] tjholowaychuk: doesn't matter if it's public docs
[16:15] xerox: chjj: how did you find the exact range?
[16:15] chjj: xerox: roger
[16:15] chapel: if not, why not just allow them to enter a docs url
[16:15] chapel: and if they have it, its a +
[16:15] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: good documentation should address the general problem that's being solved, then the specifics bit by by, possibly with a walkthrough preceeding.
[16:15] chapel: otherwise doesn't count
[16:15] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: we could also add something that sniffs for code comments, or for the length of module files, or any other heuristic.
[16:15] stehoyer has joined the channel
[16:15] chjj: xerox: oh thats not an exact range, it could be revised probably, it just grabs all non-ascii bytes a long with the word characters
[16:15] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: but "does it have a doc folder, does it have a test command, does the test pass" is probably the first set of things i'd do.
[16:15] stehoyer: hi
[16:15] chapel: then cases like tjholowaychuk's where the docs are not apart of the repo, still are considered
[16:15] tyrone: Getting this error on 'sudo make install' -- any pointers -- make: stat: makefile: Permission denied
[16:16] isaacs: chapel: ?
[16:16] chapel: ad a docs field to package.json
[16:16] chjj: xerox: i think i had a better one written down somewhere, let me check
[16:16] chapel: add
[16:16] tjholowaychuk: chapel yeah something like that
[16:16] xerox: chjj: so, say, symbols like japanese full-width exclamation mark gets matched, whereas ! doesn't by \w
[16:16] tjholowaychuk: a lot of mine have ./docs
[16:16] tjholowaychuk: with markdown
[16:16] xerox: chjj: ok thanks much
[16:16] chrisdickinson: "having documentation" does not equal "having good documentation", but since that's qualitative, i'd rather gear things towards "are there docs? are they easy to find?"
[16:16] tjholowaychuk: but not the built docs
[16:16] tjholowaychuk: i'd prefer to remove it all together
[16:16] sambasiva: Hi all,  how can we dump the outgoing http/https request including header/body?
[16:16] chapel: then, it makes it easy to also link to docs
[16:16] tjholowaychuk: seeing a "build docs" commit is really lame
[16:17] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: it's actually kind of a nice prereq to contributions to a big project -- all new features must have tests + documentation.
[16:17] chapel: I don't think it should be a prereq to be on npm
[16:18] chrisdickinson: chapel: oh no, not a prereq
[16:18] TooTallNate has joined the channel
[16:18] chapel: then people will cheat and put bare minimum stuff, and then its just worthless
[16:18] tjholowaychuk: it's just kinda overkill, you should review a lib before using it
[16:18] tjholowaychuk: regardless if it's auto-scored
[16:18] sylvinus has joined the channel
[16:18] chrisdickinson: and this is sort of separate -- sort of a "i'm looking for a library that does X. N libraries do X."
[16:18] isaacs: chapel: { "directories": { "doc" : "./my-documentation" }}
[16:18] isaacs: i'd be ok with specifying a "build the docs" command, too
[16:18] chapel: isaacs: well the key here is that not all docs are a directory
[16:19] igl: npm should have a guide
[16:19] chjj: xerox: yeah, i dunno, i guess i lost it, it would probably be better to start where ascii ends and utf begins exactly
[16:19] chrisdickinson: "library A has these features, there are 6 devs using it, and has easy-to-find documentation (here's a link) and it has these features
[16:19] chjj: xerox: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8
[16:19] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: then you could just say something like "scripts": { "doc" : "dox lib/*.js" } or somethign
[16:19] igl: and if a module follows it really well, give it a star
[16:19] igl: call it AAA module
[16:19] tjholowaychuk: chapel yeah exactly
[16:19] tjholowaychuk: could be a wiki wtc
[16:19] tjholowaychuk: etc*
[16:19] isaacs: igl: it does
[16:19] mgt__ has joined the channel
[16:19] isaacs: igl: npm help
[16:19] chjj: xerox: so something like [\w\u00c2-\uffff] would probably be better
[16:19] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: there's a value in "rewarding" the patterns that most node programs use, even if it's not 100% complete.
[16:19] jetienne: ok lets doc an URL for the doc.
[16:19] chjj: xerox: because valid utf characters "begin" around that range
[16:19] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: peple will LOOK for a doc folder, and expect markdown in it.
[16:20] isaacs: because almost all node programs do it that way.
[16:20] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: yeah i dont 100% disagree
[16:20] xerox: chjj: pm
[16:20] tjholowaychuk: i dont think it should really be part of a score but a nice flag just saying if they "have" docs or not
[16:20] jetienne: let push the tool, not the policy
[16:20] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: i wouldn't be opposed to that.
[16:20] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: if you want to do docs differently, that's fine, but the score will then suffer for your deviation from the norm.
[16:20] jetienne: else we enter in "who will control the policy"
[16:20] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: but it's a heuristic.
[16:20] isaacs: not a value judgement :)
[16:20] chapel: isaacs: I think it is an easy fix, docs: { directory: './docs' } or docs: { url: 'http://blah.com' }
[16:20] tjholowaychuk: that's lame
[16:20] tjholowaychuk: haha
[16:20] eastender has joined the channel
[16:20] tjholowaychuk: just because it's common doens't mean it's right
[16:20] jetienne: isaacs: ok so *I* do the heuristic ? no ? who does it ?
[16:21] isaacs: jetienne: it's an emergent property of all our behavior
[16:21] jetienne: isaacs: who write it ?
[16:21] dannycoates has joined the channel
[16:21] jetienne: isaacs: this is a serious question
[16:21] isaacs: jetienne: there is no single authority
[16:21] chapel: who would evaluate it
[16:21] jetienne: isaacs: WHO
[16:21] kofno has joined the channel
[16:21] isaacs: jetienne: see above.
[16:21] chrisdickinson: i'd rather sort by "number of devs who are using this library", then either a calculated heuristic (per isaacs) or a simple boolean ("has docs/").
[16:21] jetienne: isaacs: and you did answer
[16:21] isaacs: jetienne: WHO = "all of us"
[16:21] chapel: what if you look at all the available node projects, and find that docs folders aren't the norm?
[16:21] isaacs: jetienne: i have answered twice now.
[16:21] jetienne: isaacs: ok so if i dont agree the policy will never appear ?
[16:22] jetienne: isaacs: what im trying to say if such policy cant be written
[16:22] chrisdickinson: so docs wouldn't be the deciding factor, but they'd be a contributing factor.
[16:22] jetienne: isaacs: it can only be dictated
[16:22] isaacs: the question is "which of these three libs for XYZ are better?" and that's a guess, not a mandate
[16:22] isaacs: better for who?  for what?
[16:22] isaacs: on what system?
[16:22] jetienne: isaacs: and my question is who gonna be the dictator of this policy
[16:22] smolyn has joined the channel
[16:22] isaacs: what question are you really answering?
[16:22] isaacs: *asking
[16:22] chapel: if you are going to have something like that, I personally think it should be separate from npm
[16:22] isaacs: the goal should be to make the system expose information in a way that is likely to be correct, and is also easy to consume.
[16:23] jetienne: i prefer to push the tool not the policy
[16:23] jetienne: policy implies dictator
[16:23] isaacs: it's not simple.  there is no simple answer.  no one is goin gto be the king of which packages are good or bad.  this MUST be done algorithmically, and depend on community behavior.

[16:23] tjholowaychuk: community == full of ruby ppl
[16:23] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: no, but the community is the one asking.
[16:23] jetienne: isaacs: who will write it
[16:23] isaacs: jetienne: are you volunteering?
[16:24] isaacs: currently, no one :)
[16:24] chapel: but the problem comes down to who controls the algorithm, they ultimately control what goes in
[16:24] isaacs: or maybe me, eventually
[16:24] isaacs: you're al talking like we're controlling something important here.
[16:24] jetienne: isaacs: no im not volunteering for being dictator
[16:24] isaacs: like there's nukes on the line.
[16:24] chrisdickinson: isaacs: i'd love to take a stab at it, either as a part of npmjs.org or separate.
[16:24] chapel: haha

[16:24] brianm has joined the channel
[16:24] isaacs: it's based on dependencies, test coverage, the results of cpants, documentation existence, and user input.
[16:24] jetienne: isaacs: being tested is the same
[16:25] isaacs: jetienne: nothing wil stop you from using a package with a low score.

[16:27] isaacs: jetienne: ratings can be somewhat based on vote.
[16:28] Nican has joined the channel
[16:28] isaacs: jetienne: if there's a meaningful vote, it's not a dictatorship, even if a dictator has the ability to take away the democracy.
[16:28] chrisdickinson: and it wouldn't be the only data available -- it's just one more piece of information that might help one make an informed decision about which library to use.
[16:28] isaacs: it still IS a democracy.
[16:28] isaacs: then it's more like an officiator
[16:28] tjholowaychuk: i think the rating / comment system would be much more valuable
[16:28] Aikar: put 2 modules in a folder, play russian roulette (write a script to randomly delete 1), the survivor is the better of the modules
[16:28] chapel: I think for things like documents, since there are various ways to handle it, exposing them through a docs field in package.json is probably the easiest way to handle it
[16:28] tjholowaychuk: "couldn't get the tests to run" "it's awesome" blah blah
[16:28] towski has joined the channel
[16:28] jetienne: isaacs: so no policy. only vote from actual user
[16:28] tyrone: is this the appropriate command to install npm when using v0.4.10 : curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh ?

[16:29] zanes has joined the channel

[16:29] hebz0rl has joined the channel
[16:29] mehtryx has left the channel
[16:29] chapel: since a module might not be updated to a new release of node
[16:29] isaacs: jetienne: policy + vote
[16:29] chrisdickinson: I'd like to have a "guessed rating", but if it's too contentious it'd be better to get something that's at least useful out there.
[16:29] tjholowaychuk: i think word of mouth + install counts shows a lot of that
[16:29] isaacs: tyrone: yes
[16:30] jetienne: isaacs: ok only if i am the one doing the policy :)
[16:30] isaacs: jetienne: our dictator will be a robot :)
[16:30] chapel: someone has to write the robot
[16:30] jetienne: isaacs: ok so i write the robots :)
[16:30] tyrone: should the installation of npm be done inside of the same node directory or does that not matter?
[16:30] dherman: I, for one, welcome our new robot overlords
[16:30] isaacs: jetienne: and the robot will be written to guess our utility function to the best of our ability to tell it

[16:32] stehoyer: hi all, any mongoose-experts out there? i wrote a validator for a slug field which evaluates uniqueness of the field. For this i request the db, if there is an entry with the same slug. That fails if i update an object but did not change the slug, the validator fails but shouldn't. To fix this, i need the actual object within the validator to filter by id of the object so i not get the object itself if i search for 'another' object wit
[16:32] chapel: well, it has some violence, but barely
[16:32] chapel: its not porn
[16:32] dherman: btw, didn't get a reply earlier: if I do stream.on("drain", cb) will cb only receive the *next* drain event, or all subsequent drain events?

[16:38] malkomalko: anyone using the node-mongodb-native driver notice hanging open sockets to the db?
[16:38] tjholowaychuk: chrisdickinson the only problem i see with ratings / comments
[16:39] tjholowaychuk: is that they will become stale pretty quickly
[16:39] tjholowaychuk: with how fast things move in node-land
[16:39] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: good catch. maybe ratings are a sparkline across versions?
[16:39] chrisdickinson: sort of a "perceived quality based on votes over time"?
[16:39] raidfive has joined the channel
[16:39] tjholowaychuk: and like having / not having features, that will change all the time too
[16:39] tjholowaychuk: or people might just be stupid and dont know those features exist etc

[16:40] akshatj_ has joined the channel
[16:40] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: true, but if a package owner takes an interest in the site he or she could easily take ten seconds and say "yes it has this feature / no it does not have this feature".
[16:40] tjholowaychuk: people still wont read it
[16:41] jetienne: chrisdickinson: "Ability to add "features" to a tag " this one is a normal tag, no need to add complexity
[16:41] eastender has joined the channel
[16:41] jetienne: chrisdickinson: ability to comment on a package. discuss may do that easily
[16:41] chrisdickinson: jetienne: a trite example of tag/features: that comes in with "i want to see all routing libraries". "routing libraries" would be the tag. "supports regex" would be a feature for the tag.
[16:42] jetienne: Ability to categorize/tag a package ("routing", "express middleware", etc) chrisdickinson this one is alrady in package.json
[16:42] chrisdickinson: jetienne: cool -- then we pick things up based on the package.json tag.

[16:42] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[16:42] jetienne: chrisdickinson: end of my feedback
[16:42] jetienne: chapel: what do you mean
[16:43] chapel: I think if there is a way to integrate issues or something, that might work
[16:43] jacobolus has joined the channel
[16:43] chrisdickinson: chapel: that wouldn't be too difficult using the github api.
[16:43] chapel: well if it becomes popular, people will start to post issues there
[16:43] jetienne: chapel: the point is ability for user to comment on a library or not. allowed or not
[16:43] chapel: instead of using github
[16:43] tjholowaychuk: chapel even then, popular projects will have lots of issues for features/bugs etc
[16:43] tjholowaychuk: unpopular will have none
[16:43] chrisdickinson: N issues outstanding / M issues closed
[16:43] tjholowaychuk: so they will seem better
[16:43] tjholowaychuk: haha
[16:43] jetienne: chapel: i dont assume people are doing thing badly
[16:43] nerdfiles1 has left the channel
[16:44] chapel: I just think it could bring situations where module owners dont know about the site, users do and use it to complain, or report issues
[16:44] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: having a note that says "look to see that there are resolved issues. a large number of outstanding issues is a good indicator of community interest. having no solved issues is a sign that someone may be asleep at the wheel."
[16:44] jetienne: tjholowaychuk: :) onthe other hand popular will get 1000+ users and 0 for unpopular :)
[16:44] stehoyer has joined the channel
[16:44] springmeyer has joined the channel
[16:44] stehoyer1 has joined the channel
[16:44] chapel: so then the module, even though it might be actively developed and supported, would look bad, because the owner doesn't know about the site
[16:44] tjholowaychuk: i dont think we are really solving much of a problem with these things, we just need the community to not write 8 smtp modules using sendmail
[16:45] tjholowaychuk: that are almost identical
[16:45] chapel: heh
[16:45] jetienne: chapel: it looks bad only if people are writing bad thing about it
[16:45] chapel: jetienne: as tjholowaychuk said, people dont read docs before complaining
[16:45] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: but the problem is that there's... not really a good place to look to see that it exists -- and even less of a way to tell if the package is useful to them.

[16:46] necrodearia has joined the channel
[16:46] escii: how was it, together we are strong?
[16:47] chrisdickinson: the problem is that so many projects are entirely undocumented or are based on old versions of node
[16:47] tjholowaychuk: i just dont see the issue, look at the module list, review a few, pick what you want
[16:47] tjholowaychuk: done
[16:47] jerrysv: introducing the new Amazon NPM Store ...
[16:47] jetienne: tjholowaychuk: how to review a few... how long to do so. how to estimate the level of bugs after deeper usages
[16:47] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: that almost always turns into a 30 minute to hour long vetting session. i'd like to see something speed the process.
[16:48] jetienne: at least this is the issue i hit on a day to day basis
[16:48] chrisdickinson: and "continue as things are" doesn't seem like a good solution to "there are too many duplicate projects" to me, at least.
[16:48] escii: well yeah lot of outdated code out there, but what would you like to do against... if the projects was good, someone will fix it to work with never versions..
[16:48] chapel: chrisdickinson jetienne I think comments would be fine if there was a disclaimer it wasn't for issues, just for reviews
[16:48] tjholowaychuk: doesn't really matter, it's an important step
[16:48] tjholowaychuk: you shouldnt just blindly go using some lib anyway
[16:48] tjholowaychuk: if i found one that didnt escape shell args
[16:48] tjholowaychuk: and comment
[16:48] tjholowaychuk: then they fix  my comment would be stale
[16:48] tjholowaychuk: i dont want to manage a list of npm comments
[16:49] chrisdickinson: tjholowaychuk: that's fair.
[16:49] jetienne: chapel: im all for being clear with what is presented. 
[16:49] jetienne: tjholowaychuk: in most langauge people does go blindly
[16:49] chrisdickinson: so maybe nix the commenting? just go for per-version rating, plus an "i'm using this"?

[16:51] jetienne: tjholowaychuk: yep but the timeline involved is terrible and is against new comers

[16:51] tjholowaychuk: they should be reviewing code like anyone else
[16:51] jetienne: so good adoption is about welcoming new comers :)
[16:51] chapel: I guess there is the dichotomy of supporting new comers, and getting them to follow good practices
[16:52] jetienne: chrisdickinson: btw i would personally love a checkbox "work on browser too"
[16:52] chapel: jetienne: browserify
[16:52] chapel: :)
[16:52] tjholowaychuk: a good example is express-csrf, I was recommending it to people because I had heard it was working fine, then I looked at the code and it has a huge race-condition

[16:52] jetienne: chapel: good practices is a matter of policy, so dictatorship. so the question remains, who will it be

[16:53] tjholowaychuk: but
[16:53] tjholowaychuk: still
[16:54] isaacs: chapel: even unintentional trolling.  post a 1-star review, and then the bug gets fixed, and you never change it.
[16:54] isaacs: or reviews that say "it doesn't work"
[16:54] chrisdickinson: isaacs: opinion on displaying stats from github, like: "number of issues open / number of issues total"

[16:54] jetienne: i dont like to think people using my work are stupid

[16:57] jbpros has joined the channel

[16:59] jetienne: which one are actually used ? :)
[16:59] jetienne: 3-4 and the top used is a LOT more used than other with 57 users
[17:00] jetienne: symfony pluging is the same issue we are currently trying to solve. they got only the "i use this lib" vote
[17:00] chrisdickinson: slightly evil: would it be a good idea to add a settings page for package owners to enable / disable email notification?
[17:00] chrisdickinson: (disabled by default, of course.)
[17:00] jetienne: http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/sfDateTime2Plugin and this is actually the most usefull and maintained (at the time) so a good metric

[17:06] mnaser: one small iffy, if the URL has a dot in it, it breaks and think it's the format (maybe have a list of formats that it can pick of, if it doesn't, then go to default)
[17:07] japj: bnoordhuis: ping
[17:07] tjholowaychuk: mnaser with express-resource?
[17:07] donald_cook has joined the channel
[17:07] tjholowaychuk: mnaser yeah, "format" extension things suck
[17:07] tjholowaychuk: Accept is the way to go
[17:08] tjholowaychuk: I dont think I finished that yet, not sure
[17:08] mnaser: yeah, so I have "format: 'json'" so it's all json, but i have a request where it's like "get ..../targets/iqn.1234.iscsi..."
[17:08] mnaser: instead of format checking if it's .json or .xml from a list of choices, it tries .1234.iscsi.. and fallsback to default
[17:08] mnaser: even if default format is json
[17:08] mnaser: (if that makes sense)
[17:08] tjholowaychuk: yeah you would have to whitelist and attach it back on after the regexp
[17:09] tjholowaychuk: i wouldnt mind removing the format thing all together to be honest
[17:09] eee_c has joined the channel
[17:09] mnaser: yeah.. but i guess a bunch of people depend on it
[17:09] nibblebo_ has joined the channel
[17:10] tjholowaychuk: it's just more convenient than Accept
[17:10] mnaser: if it had a small check to include json/xml/html and then fallback, it'd be better than using whatever is after the dot for the format
[17:10] markmarkoh has joined the channel
[17:10] mnaser: and if someone wants to do ".myweirdformat" then they'd have to somehow do a change, i gues

[19:19] kadiks: yes I saw that, but can I take control of it like getting an API from it ?
[19:19] rhdoenges: copyboy: start from a cmd.exe
[19:19] AvianFlu: bring up the shell in its own window, or it will close when it's done :-P
[19:19] copyboy: so a .bat file doesn't do it? dang
[19:19] rhdoenges: or if you're really cool use PowerShell
[19:20] AvianFlu: copyboy: it runs, it just doesn't keep the shell open
[19:20] brainproxy: copyboy: yes, you could use a bat, but if it's not a long running process
[19:20] AAA_awright: Not if you want to examine output
[19:20] mscdex: kadiks: i'm not sure what you mean
[19:20] slifty has joined the channel
[19:20] brainproxy: then the console will appear to open then close very quickly
[19:20] copyboy: ah, i see
[19:20] rhdoenges: copyboy: the shell only stays open while the program is running
[19:20] rhdoenges: yeah
[19:20] AAA_awright: ... Since when was Windows support added? Does that count as a bug?
[19:20] brainproxy: for example, if you put this in your program, the console. window would stay open for 10 seconds
[19:20] AvianFlu: classic mistake: type `ipconfig` into the run box, say 'shit', type 'cmd' instead
[19:21] copyboy: thanks :)
[19:21] mscdex: kadiks: you can only get a string containing the preformatted stack trace
[19:21] brainproxy: setTimeout(function () {}, 10000)
[19:21] kadiks: mscdex, let's say I want to follow every call coming from a defined function and only there, I will log the stack trace
[19:21] mnaser: tjholowaychuk: aw dawg namespaces work but not with nested resources
[19:21] kadiks: I see, that was what I wanted to know. Thanks
[19:21] AvianFlu: kadiks: talk to SubStack, maybe look at node-burrito or node-detective
[19:22] brainproxy: yeah, i was thinking of node-burrito
[19:22] brainproxy: couldn't think of the name
[19:22] AvianFlu: kadiks: your concers have entered userland :-P
[19:22] maushu has joined the channel
[19:22] kadiks: ah ok
[19:22] kadiks: what is userland ?
[19:22] mscdex: node-tacobell
[19:22] brainproxy: kadiks: https://github.com/micmath/node-burrito
[19:22] rhdoenges: quick, the turtle-light!
[19:22] AAA_awright: copyboy: Or just add "pause" to the end of your .bat file
[19:22] AvianFlu: core is core, userland is stuff regular people write
[19:22] mscdex: userland is anything outside of core
[19:22] brainproxy: node-badgas
[19:22] rhdoenges: summon SubStack!
[19:22] AAA_awright: And it'll wait for you to hit Enter before closing.
[19:22] kadiks: thanks guys, I'm taking note
[19:22] webben has joined the channel
[19:22] AvianFlu: there's a post on the node core repo about what userland is
[19:23] rhdoenges: userland goes into npm modules
[19:23] rhdoenges: node core is bundled with node
[19:23] kadiks: ah so you mean I shouldn't ask that here ? Sorry about that
[19:23] rhdoenges: no, no
[19:23] kadiks: anyway, thanks
[19:23] rhdoenges: it's fine
[19:23] copyboy: AAA_awright: nah, it opens another console window, which then closes, so that doesn't do it

[19:25] kadiks: understood :-)
[19:25] rhdoenges: but if you intend to do anything serious with node linux is the best option right now.
[19:25] rhdoenges: windows is getting much much better
[19:25] brainproxy: copyboy: if you want to work w/ node in a linux environment, try installing virtual box and set up an ubuntu server virtual machine
[19:26] AvianFlu: windows won't be stable till 0.6.0
[19:26] rhdoenges: archlinux is teh best
[19:26] copyboy: brainproxy: i have that, but i don't feel like using that atm

[22:05] chjj: sounds like wherever you installed it is not in your PATH
[22:05] Poetro: or not in path
[22:05] chjj: where did you install it?

[22:06] chjj: yeah thats the repl
[22:06] Poetro: great, so u have node
[22:06] chjj: what is the path you installed it to?
[22:06] chjj: thats a good thing yeah, it means you installed it properly

[22:08] itsphil: i followed this https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation

[22:10] chjj: did you do that?
[22:10] itsphil: when i installed yeah

[22:48] jonaslund: ryah: Are there rules for the headings in the node docs or is it mostly accidental ?
[22:49] jonaslund: ryah: many "?old?" modules (fs,http,etc) seem to have the main heading as "h2/##", then functions as "h3/###" and then "types" as "h2" again.. but now i noticed that the TLS part has it's tls.Server as "h3" aswell
[22:50] bnoordhuis: jonaslund: the docs aren't always consistent :-/
[22:50] ryah: jonaslund: mm.. they should be the same
[22:50] jonaslund: ryah: I'm asking this since i'm making a generator to CHM docs from the markdown (compiled html, win32 help file) and i'm not sure how to get the contents into a sane structure
[22:51] jonaslund: ryah: if you look at the topic structure in all.html you'll see the same thing (since fs.WriteStream is h2 it gets to the same "level" as "File System" before it and "Path" after it)

[23:14] jonaslund: ryah: isaacs: anyhow for the docs, the structure today (where followed and albeit weird in some ways) kinda makes sense for reading as a html manual but works a tad less well when trying to automatically generate a sane structure (especially since it'd be easier to navigate the "structure" by grouping functions / classes separately)..
[23:14] jonaslund: ryah: isaacs: i don't wanna run off making big changes just for my own benefit that doesn't help the rest so to say :)
[23:14] isaacs: ryah: in my experience (many ages ago) making your documentation fit into chm sanely also makes it just better documentatino.

[23:32] jesusabdullah: qbert_: I think isaacs actually had some rationale for not including ratings. I don't remember what it was though, if there was one.
[23:32] jonaslund: qbert_: try http://www.jlim.se/r5rs.chm , it's made by microsofts official tool
[23:32] iammerrick: What is the quickest way to store persistent updated tabular data in Node.JS? 
[23:32] iammerrick: a flat file?
[23:32] isaacs: jesusabdullah, qbert_: yeah, no ratings.
[23:32] iammerrick: Redis?
[23:32] isaacs: certainly, no anonymous ratings, and no negative ratings.
[23:32] isaacs: just "I use this"
[23:32] isaacs: that's all.
[23:32] rhdoenges: sounds reasonable
[23:33] isaacs: with some kind of link from the package to teh user, or vice versa
[23:33] jonaslund: qbert_: i "reversed" the generation of a binary file partically from that r5rs file, the direct X docs and the open source chmc tool so it has gaps for sure
[23:33] isaacs: not sure of the best way to do that in couch
[23:33] qbert_: yes thats what I was thinking
[23:33] iammerrick: isaacs: I referring to npm packages?
[23:33] isaacs: qbert_: ^
[23:33] jesusabdullah: The *quickest* way? probably a flat file. If the sqlite bindings were better I'd suggest that too.
[23:33] iammerrick: jesusabdullah: thank you.
[23:33] qbert_: jonaslund, that file works with chmsee
[23:33] thriple: issacs: aren't there already 'most depended on?', that's pretty much a rating
[23:33] qbert_: oh thats true
[23:33] rhdoenges: not really
[23:34] jonaslund: qbert_: hmh ok, i guess i'll have to download chmsee and it's deps to see how it interprets that binary file
[23:34] rhdoenges: what about packages that are commandline tools
[23:34] jonaslund: qbert_: did it give any particular errors ?
[23:34] qbert_: ill check it out on windows
[23:34] rhdoenges: or whatever

[23:34] thriple: rhdoenges: true
[23:34] qbert_: yeah 
[23:35] jonaslund: hmmm
[23:35] qbert_: I was thinking just a +1 type of thing
[23:35] jonaslund: actually i was thinking one thing earlier
[23:35] qbert_: "I use this"
[23:35] jonaslund: i'll try removing all magic chunks and just put in the stuff i know makes sense
[23:35] rhdoenges: "I use this" sounds good
[23:36] qbert_: http://groups.google.com/group/npm-/browse_thread/thread/aecc4caba09f2e7 ,  <-- some thoughts on it
[23:36] isaacs: qbert_: yeah, i commented on it :)
[23:37] qbert_: so I guess figure out the best way to do this in couch ?
