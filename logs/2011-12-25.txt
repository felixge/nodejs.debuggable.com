[00:01] TheFuzzball: True, but Javascript has always been one of my favourites :)
[00:02] cmr: TheFuzzball: What's your favourite and least favourite part about node and javascript?
[00:02] Shaunzie: So long as it's not a functional programming language… erlang still gives me the heebie jeebies ._.
[00:02] cmr: Shaunzie: js is pretty functional
[00:03] Shaunzie: O.o
[00:03] devongovett has joined the channel
[00:04] TheFuzzball: Javascript can be OO, or procedural, or Functional, it just depends on how you use it. Same with most languages.
[00:04] Shaunzie: Javascript isn't a functional programming language different classification
[00:04] gkatsev: JS is functional.
[00:04] gkatsev: JS is multi-paradigm
[00:04] TheFuzzball: The thing I like most about Javascript is how easy it is to get things done. Also, the lack of data-types, I HATE having to specify data types :)
[00:05] Lingerance: It doesn't have the shortcutting needed to make it functional
[00:05] TheFuzzball: pointers would be cool in Javascript though.
[00:05] Shaunzie: no, you can program in a functional style within Javascript, as will many other languages, but it isn't a functional language. 
[00:05] Shaunzie: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming
[00:05] Shaunzie: data in Javascript is mutable
[00:05] Shaunzie: erlang that isn't allowed
[00:06] Shaunzie: you can't do var = stuff var = otherstuff
[00:06] cmr: I said it was pretty functional, not that it is functional. There are a lot of functional things about it.
[00:06] malkomalko has joined the channel
[00:06] cclarke has joined the channel
[00:06] cmr: There are a lot of other paradigms too, like gkatsev it is multi-paradigm.
[00:07] gkatsev: cmr: you a verb there
[00:07] gkatsev: :{
[00:07] gkatsev: :P
[00:07] TheFuzzball: :o
[00:07] Brandon_R: i don't like to use languages that take on a new paradigm just for the sake of it
[00:07] Brandon_R: tack
[00:07] cmr: gkatsev: Not a verb, an object. *You* are multi-paradigm :)
[00:07] gkatsev: cmr: "like gkatsev, it is multi-paradigm"
[00:08] gkatsev: lol, ok
[00:08] Brandon_R: there is a compiler for erlang that allows us to resuse variable names
[00:08] Brandon_R: but it gets decompiled
[00:08] TheFuzzball: gkatsev Take it as a compliment, there are just so many facets to your personality :)
[00:08] Brandon_R: much like what coffeescript doesn't to js

[00:08] Shaunzie: sorta kinda
[00:08] cmr: Never touched it.
[00:09] Brandon_R: what do you think is missing in the erlang community compared to the node.js one
[00:09] Shaunzie: mostly for sport than anything else
[00:09] Brandon_R: functional programming is too theoretical
[00:09] Shaunzie: erlang is old and stuffy. It's a hard language to learn, and more so to master. 
[00:09] Brandon_R: mostly used in academia
[00:09] SubStack: functional programming is funtimes
[00:09] SubStack: you can use a lot of the ideas without being a purist about it
[00:09] Brandon_R: lamda calculus
[00:09] Shaunzie: not so. It's used much outside of academia 
[00:10] TheMoonMaster: Erlang is pretty sweet.
[00:10] Brandon_R: i mean
[00:10] Shaunzie: erlang has it's place
[00:10] Brandon_R: yeah it probably is, idk why i said that
[00:10] TheMoonMaster: Functional language wise, I think OCaml is the nicest syntax wise.
[00:10] Brandon_R: lisp
[00:10] Brandon_R: 90 percent parentheses, 10 percent code
[00:10] TheMoonMaster: Clojure is nice as well.
[00:11] TheFuzzball: Shaunzie its*
[00:11] TheFuzzball: Can't be wasting those apostrophes :)
[00:11] Shaunzie: thank you grammar nazi :D
[00:11] Brandon_R: what is the erlang community missing?
[00:11] TheMoonMaster: A community.
[00:11] Brandon_R: lots of tutorials? libraries?
[00:11] Brandon_R: lol
[00:11] Brandon_R: that's probably true
[00:11] cmr: I don't think tutorials are valuable. Good documentation is.
[00:11] mmalecki: I like scala. if it wasn't JVM, it'd make a really awesome environment.
[00:12] Brandon_R: when i say tutorials, i mean like general talk about the language
[00:12] Brandon_R: like blog posts here and there
[00:12] TheMoonMaster: I've used a bit of Scala, my gripe is the build tool.
[00:12] Brandon_R: saying how to do stuff
[00:12] cmr: Well those aren't tutorials now. Tutorial == Walk-through
[00:12] Shaunzie: blah I hate reading useless information. 9 times out of 10 I read the code before I read the documentation
[00:12] Brandon_R: true
[00:12] Brandon_R: i guess i should say buzz
[00:13] cmr: Shaunzie++
[00:13] TheFuzzball: I find examples very helpful, but I've never had patience with walkthroughs.

[00:13] Brandon_R: examples + walkthrough?
[00:13] Shaunzie: some people have shit documentation practices or they don't document at all -.-
[00:13] Brandon_R: exampels + well documented code
[00:13] murvin has joined the channel
[00:13] Brandon_R: erlang is 20 years old so i think it skipped out on the agile stuff
[00:13] Shaunzie: examples are cool. I'd take a examples over tutorials.
[00:13] Brandon_R: just code and be done with it
[00:13] Brandon_R: whereas node was borned into an agile world
[00:14] Shaunzie: erlang was invented in the 80s so its more like 30+ years old
[00:14] murvin: merry x'mas all
[00:14] cmr: Agile is a bunch of hype over good practices that have existed for a while.
[00:14] Brandon_R: the open source version
[00:14] TheFuzzball: cmr Better than waterfall :)
[00:14] Brandon_R: hype is cool and all if it allows mass adoption of a useful concept
[00:14] Brandon_R: wuickly
[00:14] Brandon_R: quickly*
[00:15] ryan_stevens has joined the channel
[00:15] cmr: http://agilemanifesto.org/ common sense if you ask me
[00:15] RLa: no agile practices were used in 80'es?
[00:15] Brandon_R: Agile manifesto - programmers of the world unite
[00:15] cmr: I think it's a trick to fool management ;)
[00:15] mmalecki: buzzwords <3
[00:15] Shaunzie: agile isn't a trick 
[00:16] Brandon_R: do you guys node.js lived up to the buzz?
[00:16] Brandon_R: unlike amd processors
[00:16] Shaunzie: a lot of organizations subscribe to the waterfall method
[00:16] Brandon_R: or is the node.js buzz still in effect
[00:16] murvin: cmr:  hahah  yes.. Agile.  i think it is  more for corporate and management to shows that they have implemented a great method.  thus spend some budgets
[00:16] murvin: i have never worked in a company that has successfully implemented Agile.  small or large corporation.
[00:17] TheFuzzball: Shaunzie Which is a shame.
[00:17] TheJH: murvin, well, I think coding with two people in front of one PC is a good idea
[00:17] Shaunzie: waterfall isn't so bad
[00:17] Brandon_R: has anyone ever correctly implemented agile?
[00:17] Shaunzie: I like it over agile, if only because it forces you to get your documentation out of the way early on
[00:17] murvin: TheJH: hahaah yeah.
[00:17] TheJH: murvin, at least if you have non-trivial code
[00:17] RLa: what would be correct implementation?
[00:17] mmalecki: there's no such thing as 'correct agile implementation', really
[00:17] mmalecki: use whatever works for you.
[00:17] TheJH: murvin, it means that you can spot a bunch of nasty bugs much earlier
[00:17] mmalecki: processes should be adjusted
[00:18] TheFuzzball: Shaunzie Depends on the project. If the project parameters change through the lifetime of development then the waterfall model doesn't work.
[00:18] mmalecki: pair programming++
[00:18] TheJH: murvin, so at least for java, agile is good :D
[00:18] Shaunzie: yah, I don't like changing spec...
[00:18] Shaunzie: It pisses me off :D
[00:18] TheJH: Shaunzie, :D
[00:18] TheFuzzball: Agile is the solution to that then :)
[00:18] Brandon_R: do you guys think documentation is automitically matching using regex the code before each function?
[00:18] Brandon_R: like #author, #return, #purpose etc
[00:18] cmr: Brandon_R: jsdoc you mean?
[00:18] Brandon_R: yeah
[00:19] TheJH: Brandon_R, #author? just "git blame"
[00:19] Brandon_R: or should documentation be written based on use cases
[00:19] mmalecki: https://github.com/nodejitsu/haibu/blob/master/lib/haibu/core/spawner.js#L24-30
[00:19] murvin: the most interesting story I heard was.. there was a big telecommuncation company implement the Agile method.. in a extreme way.    Every one doens't has his own desk.  There is a lab like university.  Everyone goes in to the office in morning, take a desk.  Work.   Next day, go to another group another office room. "Cooperate" with another team. 
[00:19] mmalecki: yeah, #author is redundant
[00:19] cmr: I dislike most of the jsdoc overhead. I prefer to comment where comments are necessary, and write external documentation
[00:19] Shaunzie: not really
[00:19] TheJH: mmalecki, uh, wow
[00:20] Shaunzie: If more than one person is working on a package, knowing who wrote a function can be pretty important
[00:20] mmalecki: TheJH: ?
[00:20] murvin: i agree Agile idea is good.. but not many PM knows how to implement it effectively and correctly.
[00:20] Shaunzie: sure you can use svn/git etc
[00:20] TheJH: mmalecki, that story
[00:20] murvin: ends up like a mess.
[00:20] cmr: murvin: Anything in the extreme is bad, methinks.
[00:20] Shaunzie: but that's an extra step >.>

[00:23] sdwrage has joined the channel
[00:23] mmalecki: I find git blame pretty accurate
[00:23] mmalecki: you rarely change indent that much
[00:23] TheJH: true
[00:24] mmalecki: so, that file again https://github.com/nodejitsu/haibu/blame/master/lib/haibu/core/spawner.js
[00:24] Lingerance: I meant that as an example of someone using a tool that does mass code changes
[00:24] Shaunzie: At work we have svn set up to tag the author on commit which works fine
[00:24] isufy has joined the channel
[00:25] mmalecki: I'd certainly know who should I hit up with questions
[00:25] Shaunzie: if something breaks we just look at the tag line and we know who to blame. 1 less step 
[00:25] mmalecki: Lingerance: you shouldn't use that kind of tools, really
[00:25] mmalecki: Shaunzie: ewww... svn?

[00:29] Shaunzie: svn works fine for the company so I leave them be.
[00:29] SubStack: it sucks not being able to commit offline
[00:29] RLa: i like svn because of partial checkouts
[00:30] Shaunzie: mm we're an internet company, so if we don't have access to the internet, there's kind of a bigger problem there lol

[03:19] context: all the CouchDB books on amazon have three stars at best most with two. that's kind of sad 
[03:19] CarterL: context: how do you like the Riak Handbook?
[03:19] Shaunzie: Couch is nice for small stuff I think
[03:19] CarterL: i was thinking about buying that
[03:20] context: CarterL: I loved it. 
[03:20] jskulski: Hmm. I think I'm a bit confused. I'm using Juggernaut for pubsub. There is other data that is doesn't fit the publish subscribe model so I want to send that over something like socket.io. I'm having trouble both binding to Juggernaut's socket.io instance, or starting my own (it interferes with Juggernaut.) So my gut is saying that I might just be down the wrong path. Maybe I'm making the wrong assumption about pubsub? 
[03:20] context: cart 
[03:20] context: CarterL: I recommend it. 
[03:20] CarterL: context: did it help you with data modeling?
[03:21] context: CarterL: a little bit. it goes in a little about thinking about it and such and you need to think about it 
[03:21] CarterL: context:  i know what data i want to store for our project.  how we model it in a rdbs is totally different than a KV store

[03:22] CarterL: i'm pretty sure i'm equally or even more newbish then you are
[03:22] CarterL: hehe
[03:22] context: yeah. Riak search and 2i. glad they are all in one place now

[03:24] jskulski: It seems to me that I wouldn't want two socket.io connects, but could share the two

[03:26] context: jskulski: why would you need two

[15:57] omry: will add to my package
[15:58] TheJH: omry, node-waf should be included with nodejs
[15:59] omry: TheJH, I know. as I said - I am not installing with make installed. I made a debian package for it.
[15:59] omry: (I will need to install automatically on may servers, upgrades etc)
[15:59] omry: s/may/many
[16:00] TheJH: omry, ah, ok, you made a debian package for nodejs, now I understand

[16:17] omry: when installing a module, it gets compiled or something?
[16:17] cmr: Some of them.
[16:18] omry: so you need compiler on the target machines?
[16:18] omry: a bit nasty.
[16:18] tbranyen: you only need a compiler if you're installing native modules yes
[16:18] tbranyen: well how would you implement cross platform native modules heh?
[16:18] arcanis has joined the channel
[16:19] omry: you can distribute binaries 
[16:19] omry: like the rest of the world :)
[16:19] cmr: Binaries aren't cross-platform. Compiling for every platform that someone might use? Nightmare.
[16:20] omry: that's fine.
[16:20] omry: if I want to manually install a module (prefer it over having the entire toolchain on the target machines)
[16:20] omry: how do I do it?
[16:20] cmr: Should be able to drop it right into node_modules
[16:20] tbranyen: omry: ruby, python and lua all manually compile modules per platform
[16:21] cmr: And perl
[16:21] tbranyen: sure i was just listing off languages i've used
[16:21] tbranyen: so yeah node is following the rest of the world :)
[16:21] omry: :)
[16:22] omry: okay, so to be clear - when I npm install, it puts everything under node_modules in the current dir
[16:22] tbranyen: unless you add the -g folder, and unless you have a more top level node_modules folder
[16:22] tbranyen: er flag not folder
[16:22] tbranyen: might be a few other rules too
[16:22] omry: and when I run a nodejs program, where will it look for the node_modules?
[16:23] tbranyen: a number of places
[16:23] omry: if I want a system wide installation
[16:23] omry: what's a common place to drop them?
[16:23] tbranyen: NODE_PATH
[16:24] omry: just env for when I am starting nodejs, I take it?

[17:40] draginx: right
[17:40] butu51 has joined the channel
[17:41] jesusabdullah: use cluster if it fits what you're doing, but also look at dnode, worker processes managed with forever or haibu or something, using riak pubsub/mongo, some memcacheds squids, CDNs, I dunno

[19:24] Shaunzie: not really :-/. I went with mongo instead of mysql for my projects.
[19:24] aaditya: Yeah, why not mongo.
[19:24] Puj3: I guess most people have been doing that to learn two new things at once?  Or are there just very clear benefits which I'm not aware of?
[19:24] Shaunzie: MySQL is great for small projects. But it becomes increasingly complicated as you grow and I'm too lazy to work that hard :D
[19:26] Shaunzie: I think their's clear benefits for both
[19:26] Shaunzie: but I think mongo is a little easier on the upstart
[19:27] Puj3: Okay, what's the overall mentality of the node community?  It seems some of the mysql modules are a bit immature, is that the case with mongo as well, or is the community more focused on creating reliable modules for mongo than mysql?

[19:31] Puj3: maxogden: No technical reason, just to minimize the number of new technologies at once.
[19:31] maxogden: Puj3: so my answer to your question would be that most decisions in node are for technical reasons
[19:31] mattgifford has joined the channel
[19:32] Puj3: maxogden: So, in essence, use MongoDB, and find out why?
[19:32] RobotGrrl: Hello, sorry another noob question, whenever I try to use npm, it prints this out: "node.js:201 throw e; // process.nextTick error […]", is there a way to fix this?
[19:33] maxogden: Puj3: there are a lot of databases out there as well as alot of languages/frameworks. certain combinations make more technical sense than others. i dont use mongo because it doesnt fit my use cases
[19:34] Puj3: maxogden:  Any good resources about DB combinations with node and what to consider when deciding, or is mostly just trial and error right now?
[19:35] Shaunzie: Trial and error.
[19:35] jomoho has joined the channel
[19:36] maxogden: Puj3: it depends heavily on your use case. if you're just learning node to learn node then dont worry about it but if you have specific technical barriers then it makes it a lot easier to pick the right database
[19:36] pyparadigm has joined the channel
[19:38] Puj3: maxogden: Well, my database instance should be caching an nodes of a graph perhaps on the order of 10-100k and also tracking which nodes have (not) been updated.  The data from this database will be served to the client through node.  Node will also take care of updating the cache from a separate database.
[19:39] Puj3: Perhaps I should say "nodes of a graph and their edges to the other nodes in the database"
[19:40] Puj3: maxogden: And I'm trying to learn node ;P

[19:40] maxogden: Puj3: i'd use redis since it sounds like you have another database thats already persisent
[19:41] maxogden: persistent*
[19:41] maxogden: Puj3: redis is fun to model graph-like queries in
[19:41] Puj3: Okay, thanks maxogden, I'll check it out.
[19:42] aaditya: Puj3: How much is your app going to scale?
[19:42] aaditya: Are you willing to write queries?
[19:42] aaditya: It all depends on your use-case.
[19:43] maxogden: aaditya: in what database would you not write queries?
[19:43] aaditya: The beauty of mongo is that it'll allow you to store objects, and do lookups by properties. Learning curve isn't much, esp. if you already know node a bit already.
[19:43] igl1 has joined the channel
[19:43] Puj3: aaditya, Well, as far as the graph is concerned, it shan't be fast growing.  The user base shouldn't be too large either, however the request rate might be a bit high per user.  Yes I'm willing to write queries.
[19:43] aaditya: maxogden: Sorry, I meant SQL queries.
[19:44] aaditya: Puj3: fair enough. mongo is really handy when request rate goes up, due to its asynchronous non-blocking nature.

[19:44] aaditya: Sounds like SQL will do the job for you, but you may want to look into mongoskin and play around before you decide.
[19:45] Puj3: aaditya, non-blocking would fit nicely into what I'm trying to achieve, but it seems most of the MySQL modules have a non-blocking implementation in node
[19:45] Puj3: aaditya, I'll definetly take that into consideration, thanks.
[19:45] aaditya: You're welcome. :)
[19:45] Puj3: definitely*
[19:46] josh-k has joined the channel
[19:46] Puj3: Redis seems like it packs a big punch, maxogden.  It seems like it would be best utilized when you want to incorporate quite a bit of your logic into your database system.  I think my database can be pretty stupid in this case.

[19:53] RobotGrrl: Hey, does anyone know what would cause npm to print out "throw e; // process.nextTick error […]"?
[19:53] insin: CoffeeScript mostly just provides sugar for the standard inherits function
[19:53] eldios: lol
[19:53] aaditya: ("not working" is a vague expression.)
[19:53] AndreasMadsen: Pij3 inside callbacks this do not exist
[19:54] eldios: stop advertising coffescript!
[19:54] RLa: it has apache module, could be suitable for simpler apps
[19:54] eldios: I should learn!!
[19:54] eldios: XD
[19:54] eldios: you won't tempt me!
[19:54] aaditya: RobotGrrl: That's a generic error message. Full stack trace will help. Please use something like pastebin.
[19:54] Shaunzie: eldios: what are you trying to do? who is it not working?
[19:54] eldios: a closure I suppose is the answer
[19:54] eldios: using a private var
[19:55] eldios: and a "public" functino to get those values
[19:55] AndreasMadsen: Pij3 so people do that = this, since that is just a normal var.
[19:55] aaditya: I'm not working. I'm on IRC.
[19:55] maushu has joined the channel
[19:55] Shaunzie: ok. well   return this.dict[type][code] || or '' ; is wrong
[19:55] AndreasMadsen: Pij3 i use self = this
[19:56] eldios: modified
[19:56] eldios: https://gist.github.com/1519663
[19:56] eldios: Shaunzie, yes I guessed it
[19:56] insin: Puj3: functions don't know which object "owns" them. The value of "this" is determined by how a function is called. If you pass a reference to a function which expects "this" to be the "owner" of the function and it's then called, "this" will in fact be the global object.
[19:56] eldios: but it was supposed to be right in my head
[19:56] eldios: so.. why is it not right?
[19:56] eldios: =)
[19:56] aaditya: eldios: what Shaunzie said. You have an extra "or".
[19:57] eldios: ah lol
[19:57] eldios: ok that was pretty straigh
[19:57] eldios: a typo
[19:57] Puj3: Okay, insin, and AndreasMadsen, so for example, in the case of using global callbacks, if you can call them that, "this" is the global object, and that is why "that" is used?
[19:57] eldios: that's not working is this.dict[type][code]
[19:57] insin: Puj3: Assigning the current value of "this" to another variable saves you having to use one of the methods of setting it to what you "expect" it to be when passing callbacks  around
[20:00] Puj3: Alright, thanks for your help insin
[20:00] insin: "this" is determined by how you call a function - in the case of an anonymous function you've just created to be used as a callback, it's executed without a context object, so defaults to global - you can use .bind(thisValue) on a Function to explicitly set the context object  to be used at call time
[20:00] ryanrolds: Whoever at Nodejitsu that put this together is awesome: http://package.json.nodejitsu.com/

[20:00] pkrumins: just wrote this article: http://www.catonmat.net/blog/perl-regex-that-matches-prime-numbers/
[20:01] insin: but if you have lots of then in a chain, you'd have to do that for each one, whereas with var that = this, you cab just use "that" in the callbacks
[20:01] nyuszika7h has joined the channel
[20:02] Puj3: insin, assuming you want all of your callbacks to operate on "that"... I see
[20:02] Puj3: So it kind of creates the illusion of working "inside" of an object.
[20:02] Puj3: Except you have to explicitly specify which object.
[20:02] nyuszika7h: Hi, I have installed node.js and I'm getting this error when trying to use print():

[22:14] eldios: can it be considered correct to say that you use emit if you do not want to pass a callback straight away?
[22:15] andrew12: eldios: you usually don't pass a callback for emit
[22:15] Shaunzie: is request part of something else? like say express?
[22:15] eldios: meaning to do async code you can pass a callback (which would be used by the function you are calling whenever appropriate) or wait for an emit and then cal a callback
[22:15] andrew12: emit is what calls the callback
[22:15] eldios: but you could write an async module which accepts a callback to do (almost) the same work
[22:15] eldios: right?
[22:16] andrew12: I don't know what you mean

[22:17] disappearedng: aside from long polling how do you guys normally keep an connection from the browser to your nodejs server
[22:18] andrew12: socket.io is a popular library
[22:18] Shaunzie: andrew12: +1
[22:18] disappearedng: ok 
[22:19] flip_digits has joined the channel
[22:20] disappearedng: and I was wondering if there's a nice way to do this. I am creating a rails app that serves static pages. One of the pages interacts with the nodejs api that I built for interactivity. I placed my business logic inside nodejs. Now when the interactivity is done, aka user says hi to everyone, should I have node access the db directly or open up some sort of RPC call that allows node to directly talk with my rails serve
[22:20] disappearedng: r? 
[22:20] Ox2Oh has joined the channel
[22:20] andrew12: node accessing the db would be best imo
[22:20] disappearedng: but then if I change my db implementation then node will have to update 
[22:21] andrew12: sure. but you'll have to change your rpc too.
[22:21] disappearedng: well changing rpc is better than changing schema on two place
[22:21] disappearedng: at least with rpc I can test easily with rpsec
[22:21] blueadept has joined the channel
[22:21] andrew12: you shouldn't have to do anything with a schema in node
[22:22] andrew12: if you define it in rails, that is
[22:23] disappearedng: ok let me look into that, btw how complicated is your code? I did the node js beginner guide on http://www.nodebeginner.org/ and it seems like I need to have my own router or whatever.. Is there a typical pattern for this kind of server development? 
[22:23] andrew12: I try to keep mine as simple as possible, but I haven't built anything useful yet
[22:24] andrew12: trying to write some sort of clone of http://tf2r.com but openid is confusing as fuck
[22:25] disappearedng: oh yeah merry xmas
[22:25] disappearedng: there are libs out there that deals with openid
[22:25] andrew12: i know
[22:25] disappearedng: you shouldn't deal with it yourself
[22:25] andrew12: they suck
[22:25] andrew12: I keep getting "No usable providers found for the given identifier"
[22:25] disappearedng: what platform you using 
[22:25] andrew12: ... node?
[22:26] disappearedng: oh can't help you 
[22:26] andrew12: heh
[22:27] disappearedng: I remember integrating openid on rails and it took like 15 mins? 
[22:27] andrew12: I like ruby... I use it for a lot of things. I hate rails. I used to completely hate JavaScript, but after I saw node and was like "wait, this is exactly what I want", and then I realized that JavaScript isn't that bad
[22:28] andrew12: disappearedng: it should be simple but I think there's something significantly different about steam's openid api

[22:32] eldios: http://howtonode.org/control-flow-part-ii
[22:32] andrew12: eldios: oh
[22:32] andrew12: eldios: what was your question again?
[22:33] eldios: if you could write the very same code with a callback OR the emit pattern
[22:33] no_u0 has joined the channel
[22:33] boltR has joined the channel
[22:34] Squeese has joined the channel
[22:34] no_u0: i'm trying to create a new project with node 0.6.6 and express.js. However, installing express using npm only gives me 2.5, but express.js 3 is the master branch right now
[22:34] no_u0: is express.js still not production ready, or is npm outdated?
[22:34] no_u0: express.js 3
[22:34] eldios: that's the main answer --> "Sometimes you want to listen for events that can happen several times"
[22:35] andrew12: eldios: usually you pass a callback if it's like the only or the primary event for that object
[22:35] andrew12: i.e. fs.readFile or http.createServer
[22:35] eldios: mmm.. yeah.. reading so
[22:36] andrew12: though http.createServer just calls this.on('request', callback) with your callback i think
[22:36] andrew12: yeah
[22:36] andrew12: https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/http.js#L1319
[22:38] teadict: so, I don't get how Backbone and Express fit together
[22:38] TheMoonMaster has joined the channel
[22:39] zodiak: teadict, backbone is purely client/frontend side, express is backend
[22:39] teadict: zodiak: I heard Backbone could be used in the server..
[22:39] teadict: s/heard/read/
[22:40] zodiak: teadict and you could probably use node in the web browser, doesn't make it a 'good idea'
[22:40] teadict: because Express already does what Backbone does?
[22:40] Cromulent has joined the channel
[22:40] zodiak: huh ? jst think of it as express === server, backbone === client
[22:40] zodiak: anything else is madness ;)
[22:41] teadict: but but...

[22:41] VICODAN has joined the channel
[22:41] VICODAN: sup
[22:41] andrew12: this is athens
[22:41] teadict: I thought Backbone.. lawl.. was this decoupled stuff that gave you structure wherever you wanted it
[22:41] teadict: while Express is a frameworky thingy
[22:41] context: wow. i was intrigued by Haraka , now im watching the itnro video and im turned off
[22:41] andrew12: ACTION doesn't get the use for backbone
[22:41] zodiak: teadict, backbone is mvc for the client, express is mvc(ish) for server
[22:42] context: it base install has > dozen config files
[22:42] andrew12: express is not a MVC
[22:42] zodiak: andrew12, backbone didn't make a tonne of sense to me, until I saw the 'render()' call ;)
[22:42] teadict: alright.. tha's the 3rd time you say that.. I'll start looking at it liek that..
[22:42] Sorella: andrew12, people are clearly too used to Rails :3
[22:42] context: express isn't mvc in anyway shape or form
[22:42] zodiak: andrew12, that's why I said 'ish'
[22:42] teadict: that's what I thought!
[22:42] andrew12: well it does the controller part
[22:42] andrew12: that's it though
[22:42] andrew12: zodiak: it's not even close
[22:43] andrew12: express is to node as sinatra is to ruby (http://www.sinatrarb.com/)
[22:43] context: zodiak: no. it has no M in mvc, it has no C on mvc, it has no V in mvc.
[22:43] andrew12: it certainly has the C
[22:43] andrew12: and it knows a bit about the V
[22:43] context: it kind of has the C
[22:43] andrew12: but there's no idea of models in it
[22:43] context: andrew12: only what you tell it
[22:43] teadict: so , nobody really knows, great
[22:43] zodiak: context, it is definitely missing the 'm' part .. but the rest.. I am not so sure
[22:43] zodiak: which is why I said 'ish' ;)
[22:43] teadict: okey, then why couldn't you create the M with Backcbone?
[22:44] andrew12: model = database
[22:44] context: you can ?
[22:44] teadict: can't you like sync backbone models with some database?
[22:44] teadict: like ExtJs does 
[22:44] teadict: isn't that the point?
[22:44] context: wtf
[22:45] teadict: dammit, there's too many modules to learn!
[22:45] rurufufuss has joined the channel
[22:45] context: if you're using backbone and extjs on the same site, i never want to work with you
[22:45] teadict: no.. it'll be all node
[22:45] zodiak: hah!
[22:45] wmage: nice
[22:46] teadict: and so far, express on the S, backbone on the C..
[22:46] context: s/if.*site, //
[22:46] teadict: with all the other stuff needed of course..
[22:46] wmage: so how do you guys feel about using only websockets for data sync? instead of ajax
[22:46] context: </troll>
[22:46] teadict: ajax is not dead!
[22:47] context: wmage: i see no problem with it. depending on your target audience anyway
[22:47] andrew12: i still have no idea what backbone is or does, so i can't really help here :p
[22:47] teadict: andrew12: https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-fundamentals
[22:48] context: teadict: just stop.
[22:48] andrew12: teadict: tl;dr
[22:48] teadict: wat
[22:48] teadict: andrew12: it lets you create models basically
[22:48] teadict: of anything
[22:48] context: andrew12: backbone kind of mvc for client side (but there are ways to use it server side)
[22:48] andrew12: i see
[22:48] context: its like MC
[22:48] andrew12: that's kind of backwards
[22:48] andrew12: 'backbone client side'
[22:48] jhine has joined the channel
[22:49] teadict: but apparently it's stupid to use it sever-side since there's express
[22:49] context: heh
[22:49] context: backbone and express have nothing to do with eachother
[22:49] andrew12: uh
[22:49] context: they do totally different things
[22:49] context: teadict: stop comparing cars to boats.
[22:49] teadict: I'm not wanting to use them together..
[22:49] context: i dont need a corolla, i got a skidoo
[22:50] context: why NOT ?
[22:50] andrew12: if backbone is MC (that is, model, controller), and express is... nothing but a framework... you can't really compare them
[22:50] context: teadict: like i said.... JUST STOP
[22:50] andrew12: stop trying to put a tiller on your car
[22:50] context: you've made zero sense since i started talking to you
[22:50] teadict: question: does express have Models?
[22:50] andrew12: no
[22:50] teadict: okey
[22:50] context: teadict: whats the website say
[22:51] teadict: it says nature calls
[22:51] context: http://expressjs.com/ -- its got a features bullet point list
[22:51] andrew12: express doesn't do anything except for view related stuff really.
[22:51] andrew12: well
[22:51] teadict: doesn't it solve the routing?
[22:51] teadict: thought that was the most important part
[22:51] context: teadict: READ THE FUCKING WEBSITE
[22:51] andrew12: i'd like to describe it as a framework for building web applications simply and quickly
[22:51] context: Robust routing
[22:51] teadict: oh jesus okey
[22:51] context: first god damn bullet point
[22:52] wmage has joined the channel
[22:52] zodiak: context, and you wonder why I fell back on the 'mvc' thing ;P
[22:52] context: teadict: if you actually read about the libraries you're considering using before talking about them and asking questions, you might not sound like such a retard
[22:53] context: zodiak: i dont care what you call it. he still hasn't read a single word on the express website
[22:53] zodiak: context, why read on the website when you can jst ask in irc </sarcasm>

[23:05] teadict: you're exagerating

[23:12] teadict: context: I said that's what I had already read!
[23:12] teadict: I SAID IT
[23:12] teadict: explicitly
[23:12] context: teadict: you could have had your answer 20 minutes ago. infact im pretty sure i questioningly asked why you cant use backbone on the server after googling. (HINT you should probably google when people question what you said)

[23:41] teadict: let'see..
[23:41] teadict: I'm learning node
[23:41] andrew12: https://github.com/andrew12/node-mvc-example
[23:41] teadict: not the language
[23:41] teadict: and I'm already in the phase where one filters what modules will one use.. so that's why I'm so fussy about it
[23:41] context: yeah but all i see is you asking questions about 20 different modules. nothing regarding node. and not actually writing any code
[23:42] michaelhartau has joined the channel
[23:42] teadict: because that part is already solved, gotta choose my modules before coding
[23:42] teadict: I'm analizing everything
[23:42] teadict: in paper
[23:42] teadict: sort of speak
[23:43] context: then you will have to analyze how to lay out your code, how to layout your db, where certain files should go, prototype or inheritence. you might get some code written in two weeks
[23:44] teadict: I've done it before, that's the next part..
[23:44] context: and even after that, you are going to run into a module and be like 'darn i should use that.'
[23:44] teadict: yeah
[23:44] teadict: which is part of the fun
[23:44] context: ... stop planning, start doing.
[23:44] context: no planning is extremely boring
[23:44] teadict: but anyway.. choosing the core-y modules is more critical
[23:45] teadict: but yes, I'm starting to code as soon as January begins
[23:45] teadict: which is when I told them I'll finnish all the planning and modeling phase
