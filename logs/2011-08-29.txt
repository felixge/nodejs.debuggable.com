[01:03] bettsp: I have a noob question - now that npm 1.x defaults to per-project package installs, what's the best way to run bins
[01:03] Nuck: run bins?
[01:04] bettsp: Like executables
[01:04] bettsp: Do I really have to add every project I use commonly to $PATH?
[01:04] Nuck: What about executables?
[01:04] Nuck: Are you talking about the C++ moduleS?
[01:04] Nuck: or jsut calling on an exe file?
[01:05] bettsp: No, like coffee-script has "coffee", or Cakefile has "cake"
[01:05] bettsp: They get stored under $PROJECT/node_modules/.bin
[01:05] Nuck: bettsp: For things like that, you do npm install -g coffeescript
[01:05] Nuck: that forces a global install
[01:07] bettsp: That doesn't seem like the "correct" way to do things

[01:11] JaKWaC has joined the channel
[01:11] Bjfnvfhd: Hi
[01:11] chjj: i always found headers to be kind of a sticky situation there, because you *have* to buffer headers, theres no way around it
[01:11] chjj: unless you want to dispatch header events with pieces of headers
[01:11] Nuck: chjj: But *why*
[01:11] chjj: which wouldnt be very pleasant for the user
[01:11] g2446 has joined the channel
[01:11] Nuck: I could buffer each header individually
[01:12] Bjfnvfhd: I love node
[01:12] Nuck: And dispatch a 'header' event after each one
[01:12] chjj: Nuck: yeah, thats why i mean
[01:12] chjj: but theres no way around buffering there
[01:12] chjj: what i mean*
[01:12] Nuck: Or I could buffer them all up and pass it to the callback for the 'part' event
[01:12] chjj: in my own parser, i abstract that all away, there is no header event
[01:12] chjj: the headers are handled internally
[01:13] chjj: it depends on how low-level or malleable you want to make it
[01:13] Nuck: chjj: I'm thinking it might be nice to provide them streamingly
[01:13] chjj: yeah, then the user could do whatever he wanted with them
[01:13] Nuck: Well, I follow the Node concept of "don't abstract much"
[01:13] Nuck: Exactly
[01:13] Nuck: Gonna make an epic testkit for this too
[01:13] chjj: i just did it my way to make things simpler, and because i only wanted to use it for one thing
[01:14] Nuck: Take a multipart string and fake the data events to the parser so it splits on every point
[01:14] Nuck: So it will determine if there's any SPOF in there
[01:14] chjj: i think a better design question is how to handle parse errors
[01:14] chjj: gracefully or strictly
[01:14] neoesque has joined the channel
[01:14] Peniar has joined the channel
[01:14] Nuck: chjj: I'm just gonna die if there's some major issue
[01:15] Nuck: I'm not gonna try and write a "tag soup" parser
[01:15] Nuck: That leaves room for errors
[01:15] chjj: Nuck: thats what i do now, i originally wrote it buffering the last 3 bytes so i could gracefully handle parse errors
[01:15] Nuck: And possible security hole
[01:15] chjj: but it really complicated things
[01:15] chjj: yeah
[01:15] chjj: it was really hard to secure then, there were possibilities of overflows during the buffering of a header
[01:16] Nuck: I rewrote my parser from before, now it handles multiple parts in a single chunk
[01:16] chjj: because i was trying to gracefully handle errors
[01:16] Nuck: Yeah, I'm gonna follow the rule of KISS
[01:16] Nuck: Now, headers will always be separated from the body by the first \r\n\r\n, right?
[01:16] chjj: yes

[02:27] modular: i'm doing some experiments to see how node handles large arrays? i push a million character string onto an array 1 million times? that should take up a 1000 gigs of ram, yet node doesn't crash, and top only shows node using about 90M of ram...
[02:27] modular: and i can pull things out of the array just fine. what's going on? am i missing something?
[02:29] sneakyness: if it's the same million character string I would imagine it would only need to store it in memory once
[02:29] MrNko has joined the channel
[02:29] sneakyness: have you tried unique million character strings?

[04:44] nimstr: I've heard node.js doesn't work well with other frameworks very well, because it's only meant for IO; anyone know how difficult it would be to use node.js on top of ruby on rails?
[04:44] cliffano has joined the channel
[04:44] nimstr: in other words, using ruby on rails as the main data model and having node.js to handle some real-time i/o
[04:44] matyr has joined the channel
[04:46] Nuck: nimstr: Ruby is slower no matter what
[04:46] Nuck: We're on V8, the only thing thats' gonna beat us at speeds will be native code
[04:46] Nuck: And even then, the overhead of calling out to native code prevents that
[04:47] g2465 has joined the channel
[04:47] nimstr: I understand, but I just don't like the frameworks built on top of node.js thus far.  They don't use the design patterns I've grown to love
[04:47] Nuck: And what do you mean "doesn't work well with other frameworks"?
[04:47] Nuck: nimstr: Get used to it, with a language comes the design patterns it brings
[04:47] g2466 has joined the channel
[04:47] Nuck: You look at ExpressJS?
[04:47] nimstr: this seems to be the concensus
[04:48] nimstr: yeah, express.js doesn't use MVC
[04:48] nimstr: here's the reference
[04:48] nimstr: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3527482/ruby-on-rails-and-node-js
[04:48] g2452: nimstr: Some other Ruby frameworks might be fast enough but I really prefer Python Flask myself. Simple and *fast* (well, fast considering that it is a dynamic language we are speaking of).
[04:49] Nuck: nimstr: Just make the jump.  Learn that MVC ain't so rigid
[04:49] shanebo: Nuck, MVC is the awesomesauce
[04:49] Nuck: Use Mongoose for Model, Express for View, and Control shit with jQuery
[04:49] shanebo: nimstr, I actually agree with you
[04:49] Nuck: Problem solved
[04:50] Nuck: :P
[04:50] Nuck: MVC is one of those things that people put way too much thought into
[04:50] nimstr: hmm… that's too pro for me
[04:50] Nuck: The best code is that which you don't hafta think about
[04:50] shanebo: Nuck, the hidden stuff is what gives me nightmares :D
[04:50] Nuck: Let your code form naturally, don't force it into a rigid structure
[04:50] Lorentz: i.e. code someone else wrote and isn't your problem to fix
[04:50] nimstr: I can look at any rails app and know exactly what's going on almost immediately
[04:50] nimstr: because everything has a defined structure
[04:51] shanebo: nimstr +1
[04:51] Nuck: nimstr: Same goes for Express apps
[04:51] Nuck: It's a different structure, but you get used to it
[04:51] Nuck: And forcing everyone to use the same exact style is NEVER a good thing
[04:51] chjj: nuck: i kind of agree, im for following mvc as a general philosophy, but using a heavyweight mvc framework is really ugly imo
[04:51] shanebo: I love that you can drop into Rails IRC and ask what's the way to do something and they tell you :D They don't say well here's 35 ways you could do that.. Pick one.
[04:51] Nuck: It is invariably a negative, it prevents you from doing what feels right
[04:52] Nuck: I roughly follow MVC
[04:52] Nuck: I'll be honest, it's some semblance of MVC
[04:52] Nuck: But, I don't actively attempt to stick to MVC
[04:52] nimstr: alright, I guess I don't have the expertise yet to argue; I'll take a look at express; in the meantime, I have some apps built already in rails, just wondering if it's possible to port the i/o speed of node.js to rails
[04:52] Nuck: nimstr: Node isn't magically fast, it's the fact that we have asynchronous I/O
[04:53] jerrysv_ has joined the channel
[04:53] chjj: im so glad express is what it is, and not some hideous mvc framework
[04:53] kiffness_ has joined the channel
[04:53] Nuck: chjj: Agreed
[04:53] Nuck: I don't get why people seem to put so much stock in these MVC frameworks
[04:53] chjj: we couldve been stuck with something terrible, instead we got something really nice
[04:53] Nuck: I think it's Stockholm Syndrome
[04:53] fairwinds_ has joined the channel
[04:53] nimstr: >.< I understand, just wondering if anyone here has had experience building real-time apps using node.js interacting with a rails data model
[04:53] toki_kanno has joined the channel
[04:53] apang42 has joined the channel
[04:54] Nuck: People have gotten so used to this rigid-ass MVC setup that to move to something so free-formed as Express or Node seems odd to them.
[04:54] Nuck: It's a classic case of Stockholm Syndrome.
[04:55] Nuck: nimstr: Just as you wouldn't make one thing using both Java and C++, you wouldn't do Ruby and Node.
[04:55] shanebo: chjj, Nuck, I've written an MVC framework that's probably less than 800 LOC on top of connect. There's nothing bloated or nasty about it. I think you'all may be averse to too much magic, and I agree. Rails gets too magical for my taste...
[04:56] fangel has joined the channel
[04:56] Nuck: shanebo: It's not that it *is* bloated, it's that it FEELS bloated.
[04:56] Nuck: You can't measure bloat in LOC
[04:56] chjj: shanebo: its not just bloat in most of them
[04:56] chjj: its very rigid like nuck said
[04:56] slifty has joined the channel
[04:56] Nuck: Exactly, the rigidity is the problem.
[04:56] shanebo: exactly. because they believe that's the cleanest pattern.
[04:56] shanebo: (which I agree with)
[04:57] chjj: like i said, im all for following mvc as a general philosophy, but i dont need a framework to do it
[04:57] Nuck: I am a fan of what I call Organic Development.  By that I mean I let my code flow like diahrea from my fingertips.
[04:57] g2467 has joined the channel
[04:57] Nuck: I let it organize itself following logical patterns

[04:57] chjj: okay, i disagree with that part ^

[04:57] shanebo: when you don't embrace a pattern you end with spaghetti, repeating yourself all over the place and quadrupling the size of your codebase
[04:57] Nuck: chjj: lol
[04:58] theCode has joined the channel
[04:58] Nuck: shanebo: Not at all
[04:58] nimstr: when trying to convince people to switch to your coding philosophy, never compare your code to diahrea, haha
[04:58] Nuck: If that's your default structure, there's a problem.
[04:58] chjj: shanebo: you dont need a framework to embrace a pattern
[04:58] Nuck: My code defaults to a frameworkless sorta-MVC-if-you-wanna-call-it-that
[04:59] shanebo: chjj, agreed, but you'll have to write your own then… which I did
[04:59] Nuck: I don't slap a label on it
[04:59] nimstr: the problem I think is that you guys are working on project by yourselves
[04:59] Nuck: shanebo: Or better yet, don't use anything
[04:59] Nuck: And just built it yourself
[04:59] Nuck: nimstr: Not at all
[04:59] nimstr: you'll understand the beauty of MVC when you have to work on a project with 10+ people
[04:59] chjj: shanebo: right, but i would never abstract "my own" into a framework, because it makes things more rigid
[04:59] Nuck: I've got two other programmers working with me on this project, and my code is quite beautiful
[04:59] Nuck: A framework is pointless
[05:00] Nuck: nimstr: You'll understand the beauty of letting it organize itself when you need to meet a deadline for building something you haven't done before.
[05:00] Nuck: I use a mixture of OOP and Functional code, with code organized by purpose more than Model, View, and Controller
[05:00] shanebo: chjj, I suppose you'd have to give an example where MVC falls short in order for me to see where you're coming from. I've never run into a scenario where it felt rigidly impractical
[05:01] Nuck: Hell, I don't really have any Views in Node.
[05:01] Nuck: Or Models

[05:02] Nuck: I have a database layer which handles common functions there, then I have my API layer, then I have my actual site on a separate Nginx server, using AJAX to load it in
[05:02] Nuck: shanebo: Mongo

[05:03] blessYAHU: for the node windows build, what directory do node_modules go in? 
[05:03] Nuck: It allows me fine-grained control over everything, opening up thousands of ways to optimize code, etc.
[05:04] shanebo: Nuck, but I guarantee you that you've not done anything that hasn't already been done, pattern-wise. Only difference is you don't know what pattern it is ;)
[05:04] Nuck: blessYAHU: If you have /foo/bar/app.js requiring 'thing', it checks /foo/bar/node_modules, then /foo/node_modules, then /node_modules/
[05:04] Nuck: It just climbs up
[05:04] blessYAHU: Nuck: Thank you.
[05:05] Nuck: shanebo: No, the difference is, I'm not labelling it and claiming that it's the One True Pattern, unlike all you MVC crazies.

[05:06] shanebo: because that's what "abstractions" are… ways to avoid repeating yourself
[05:07] Nuck: shanebo: Not at all.  One of the core goals in NodeJS, as stated by ryan, is to avoid abstractions!
[05:07] Nuck: Because abstractions suck ass!
[05:07] shanebo: Nuck, javascript is an abstraction
[05:07] shanebo: every time you use a method on any type, that's an abstraction
[05:08] Nuck: shanebo: When we work in NodeJS we deal directly with POSIX calls
[05:08] nimstr: does node have a "gem-like" equivalent
[05:08] shanebo: side question, how come express passes req/res to every route method?
[05:08] Nuck: We have a fancy wrapper around it, but it's the same thing
[05:09] nimstr: so that if someone has written a chunk of code, I can reuse it?
[05:09] Nuck: nimstr: Better, we have NPM!

[05:09] nimstr: ah, right...
[05:10] Nuck: shanebo: Watch the Introduction to Node.js video
[05:10] shanebo: Nuck, side question, how come express passes req/res to every route method? Why not set req/res to the app which can be accessible from any route method?
[05:10] Nuck: You will hear Ryan flat-out say "we didn't want any uneccessary abstractions"
[05:10] Nuck: Because req and res are per-request
[05:11] Nuck: The server would not have them yet
[05:11] shanebo: keyword is "unnecessary"
[05:12] shanebo: Nuck I mean, request comes in, you set it to the app var so that it's accessible from any route, meaning the route wouldn't get fired unless it was requested
[05:12] Nuck: shanebo: Trust me, your additions are EXTREMELY uneccessary
[05:12] Nuck: shanebo: That'd be juggling variables, a very bad thing.
[05:12] Nuck: The app is not per-client
[05:12] shanebo: Nuck, how do you route to methods through paths?
[05:12] Nuck: It's global to all connections
[05:12] Nuck: What?
[05:13] shanebo: I'm asking how YOU fire methods given the requested url
[05:13] Nuck: shanebo: I use Express :V
[05:13] shanebo: (now explain how the way you handle that, isn't an abstraction)
[05:14] Nuck: It's a simple routing framework
[05:14] Nuck: It's code I would write too
[05:14] shanebo: right, and that's all I'm doing
[05:14] Nuck: req and res are directly off the HTTP server
[05:14] Nuck: That's not mcuh of an abstraction

[05:15] Nuck: shanebo: No, it's just that you seem to accept MVC as the One True Way, when it's just One Of The Many, Many Ways
[05:15] Nuck: And it's at one end of te spectrum
[05:16] Nuck: I use whatever system works best for the current situation
[05:16] Nuck: It's adaptive, agile, and extremely efficient.
[05:16] shanebo: Nuck, I didn't say MVC was THE WAY for you
[05:16] Nuck: I just do whatever
[05:16] shanebo: I said I embrace the pattern of MVC as the best way to organize my code. and I've never run into a situation where it failed
[05:17] Nuck: And I said MVC is insanely rigid
[05:17] Nuck: It forces your code to fit its techniques.
[05:17] jesusabdullah: I say, keep mvc in mind if it helps, and deviate when it makes sense to
[05:17] Nuck: And it adds magic
[05:17] jesusabdullah: y'know, if you're comfortable with the mvc paradigm
[05:17] Nuck: I don't do magic, I make it quite obvious what's going on and I organize my code however seems most logical for the project

[05:19] shanebo: a request is made, it routes to a method, a method does something, the result is rendered to the front-end
[05:19] Nuck: Mine is bit more complex
[05:19] shanebo: so you can either repeat in every method, rendering to the front-end, or write a controller class that handles that for you
[05:20] Nuck: I only use Express because it is a very light abstraction layer
[05:20] Nuck: I can organize my code however I want, and I do so

[05:27] Nuck: It's the Apple effect
[05:27] Nuck: shanebo: It was championed by Ruby
[05:27] Nuck: Not by Rails
[05:27] Nuck: No, not at all
[05:27] Nuck: Rails threw a wrench in it by hooking the belief that Agile didn't work
[05:28] shanebo: Nuck, what are you talking about? Hahaha
[05:29] shanebo: agile was born out of convention over configuration

[05:38] Nuck: You can't argue with that, it's facts.
[05:38] shanebo: Nuck, it's simple man. People got tired of the spaghetti code (that you're promoting). So they started writing frameworks. One of which was Rails. MVC, convention over configuration. And what it allowed was for people to not worry about code structure as much and focus more on their end result. The idea being, the framework made a lot of the decisions for you and allowed for quick/easy iterations, i.e., "Agile".

[05:41] shanebo: jesusabdullah, agreed, but when did agile get legs? Was it not right when Rails hits?
[05:41] jesusabdullah: No, it was when we weren't building cars anymore
[05:42] jesusabdullah: and when the managers got their hands on the self-help books
[05:42] jesusabdullah: Rails may have *helped* in that it gives you 90% of some subset of webapps you might want to write

[05:55] g2473 has joined the channel
[05:56] chjj: davidbanham: i never tried irssi in the first place for "nerd cred", i tried it because i was out of ideas, and every irc client i had ever tried previous to it was terrible

[05:56] chjj: ive really hated every irc client ive ever tried
[05:56] chjj: as long as i can remember
[05:56] Lorentz: Maybe rewrite irssi in node?
[05:57] chjj: yes!
[05:57] shanebo: meaning, if request A comes in and it has 15 methods before it's done, and request B comes in at method 7, is it added to the event loop at that point or does it go at the end of once request A is done?
[05:57] Lorentz: With near identical interface, and loadable scripts being javascript
[05:57] davidbanham: chjj: There's nothing pejorative about my use of "nerd cred". I shamelessly love my nerd cred and seek it out wherever possible!
[05:57] chjj: davidbanham: sure, im just saying, thats not why i tried it in the first place

[06:14] g2474 has joined the channel
[06:14] shanebo: :), if request A has 15 subsequent methods before the req.end() and request B comes in when request A is on method 7, will request B and it's subsequent methods go after req.end of request A, or be added into the loop at method 7 of request A?
[06:14] shanebo: chjj ˆˆ
[06:15] chjj: if all of those methods are synchronous, req B will come after the req.end() for A
[06:16] chjj: synchronous stuff will block anything thats waiting on the event loop

[06:19] tylerstalder has joined the channel

[06:19] jvolkman: as soon as you defer the request to access a file, wait for a timer, etc, node gets back to its loop.

[06:24] Nuck|mobile: All apps should aspire to be as well-made as colloquy mobile.
[06:24] chjj: shanebo: i also dont understand, if youre just getting a request through your router or what have you, you dont have to worry about the request magically changing into a different request
[06:25] shanebo: chjj, no, but the default controller render method does. it loads the view and layout template
[06:25] Nuck|mobile: Customizable, but not excessively so, insanely stable, and a beautiful UI
[06:25] _root_ has joined the channel
[06:25] chjj: why is the render async if youre just buffering it and dumping it into .end?
[06:26] shanebo: chjj, I'm using readFile, which I thought was async??
[06:26] chjj: shanebo: you have to show me some code for me to give you a thorough answer, otherwise, what i said before is what you need to know
[06:26] chjj: well, it is async, but you can also call readFileSync
[06:27] shanebo: I see, and that's not a no no?
[06:27] shanebo: :D
[06:27] chjj: most templating engines or view systems will cache compiled templates
[06:27] chjj: its not a no-no
[06:27] vikstrous has joined the channel
[06:27] chjj: if youre caching the compiled template, in fact, its a yes-yes
[06:27] chjj: its much faster because you dont have to do any io
[06:28] chjj: you only have to do io the first time
[06:28] chjj: when you read it and compile it for the first time
[06:28] shanebo: should I load up all views before starting the server rather than readFile each request?
[06:28] chjj: yeah, that works
[06:28] chjj: just cache them afterward
[06:28] chjj: its how most frameworks implement their view systems
[06:29] chjj: or i guess i should say, every framework
[06:29] shanebo: and doing readFileSync at that point is okay because the server hasn't started yet right?
[06:29] chjj: the template is read and compiled once, and then cached
[06:29] chjj: yes its okay, but its even okay after the server has started *as long as you cache it* and arent calling it for every request
[06:30] shanebo: chjj cache it manually or is there a node core way to do that?
[06:30] chjj: cache it manualy
[06:30] chjj: unless youre using some kind of framework
[06:31] shanebo: well data is dynamic in views though
[06:31] chjj: right
[06:31] chjj: which is why you compile the template, and cache the compiled function
[06:31] shanebo: so maybe I cache the readFile contents and access each time and render via mustache each time
[06:31] chjj: and then you have a function you can pass locals to
[06:32] g2476 has joined the channel

[06:32] g2476: /nick chris
[06:33] chjj: templates are compiled into javascript, using using the function constructor - you can cache this compiled function, and simply pass locals to it whenever you want to render something

[06:34] shanebo: is it on github? and what are the differences?
[06:35] g2477: Testaa uutta irkkiä
[06:35] Nuck|mobile: Eh, I don't think I ever open-sourced it. It's just a very simple thing, tbh, nothing fancy
[06:36] g2478 has joined the channel
[06:36] shanebo: the mustache I'm using is only about 300 lines
[06:36] shanebo: it's super fast
[06:36] shapeshed has joined the channel
[06:36] Nuck|mobile: It's just a simple function that accepts a string and an object, array, or series of arguments
[06:37] Nuck|mobile: It then replaces {key} with the values
[06:37] Nuck|mobile: And returns ir
[06:37] Nuck|mobile: It was speedy, simple, and adaptive.
[06:37] chjj: shanebo: all that matters is the function thats return, the speed of parsing and compiling is irrelevant
[06:37] chjj: returned*
[06:38] chjj: btw
[06:38] chjj: https://github.com/chjj/liquor
[06:38] chjj: my templating engine ^ :)
[06:38] Nuck|mobile: I should make my parser return the function
[06:38] Nuck|mobile: It could allow for more optimizations.

[06:39] newy has joined the channel
[06:39] chjj: Nuck|mobile: thats all it should do, theres nothing faster than a function that does a few string concatenations or an array.join()
[06:39] Nuck|mobile: Mine is all through string.replace
[06:40] Nuck|mobile: And a for loop to iterate over the keys
[06:40] chjj: yeah, you should compile a function instead
[06:40] Nuck|mobile: I agree

[06:41] chjj: i kind of wish js had some kind of native interpolation
[06:41] shanebo: Nuck|mobile how do you handle nested objects?
[06:41] shanebo: dot notation?
[06:42] Nuck|mobile: I don't, simply put.
[06:42] Nuck|mobile: Lol
[06:42] shanebo: :)
[06:42] Nuck|mobile: It was very, very basic.
[06:42] Nuck|mobile: But i will likely use dot notation, yeah

[08:38] antris: I'm using https://github.com/jorritd/node-watch to watch some files so i can run Jasmine specs. The problem is, when I change my spec file and it runs the tests again, the results don't change like they should. If there's a test expect(true).toBe(true); and I change it to expect(true).toBe(false);, it'll still pass.
[08:38] antris: Is my tests being cached in some weird way?
[08:38] antris: Are*
[08:39] antris: The results work correctly when I shut the autotest process and start it up again, but with the file watch, they don't.

[11:18] Chopinn has joined the channel
[11:19] eldios: colors would be more appropriate and easy to use for the nodejs lolcat impementation possibly
[11:19] eldios: but node-charm is simply freaking awesome!

[11:20] DrMcKay: eldios: OK, I'll use colors for cat

[11:44] blueadept: right, i'm doing that
[11:44] blueadept: i go to /usr/local/node/node_modules and i see my module 
[11:45] nbjayme: H4ns: i've already taken out the catch(e) line and sys.put and still the same result. :-(  looking closely into the code. 
[11:45] blueadept: and its linked. but when i go to the project where i want to use the module, i do npm link <module name> and it failed saying it can't find, and then deletes my module

[11:46] japj: blueadept: did you npm install <your module> -g?

[11:48] blueadept: cool, will do
[11:48] blueadept: i'm seeing something similar here: https://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues/795
[11:49] nbjayme: H4ns: i am attempting to override the errors in nodejs so I can have option to bring that to the browser or any format I want to show. :-)
[11:49] japj: blueadept:  what version of npm are you using?
[11:49] nbjayme: H4ns: i don't want the app to just hand and die because of syntax errors. :-)
[11:49] blueadept: 1.0.6
[11:49] nbjayme: H4ns: i am using the latest node, btw.
[11:49] japj: blueadept: that is ancient, we're at 1.0.27 at the moment
[11:49] blueadept: ha

[15:43] fangel has joined the channel
[15:44] DrMcKay: OVER NINE THOUSAND!

[15:45] jtsnow has joined the channel
[15:45] mikl has joined the channel
[15:45] jheusala: ekryski: it depends on lot of things. Any one number cannot be said with this information.
[15:46] H4ns: ekryski: the thread pool is there so that node can run blocking operations, not to offload computation to some (virtual) core.

[15:47] slaskis: tjholowaychuk: i must say your deploy script is just brilliant
[15:48] ekryski: H4ns: yes. but I'm wondering is if you have 1 thread for node and the 4-5 for the thread pool it already doesn't leave much left over for anything else to go on the box (with an 8 thread machine)
[15:48] tjholowaychuk: slaskis haha thanks, i haven't used it much yet so i haven't polished things up but it's a start
[15:48] H4ns: ekryski: a thread that sleeps waiting for some i/o to finish does not make use of a core.
[15:48] ekryski: I'm not sure but can more than one node.sj instance share the thread pool?
[15:48] slaskis: took me 15 minutes to set up and deploy to my linode with it
[15:48] tjholowaychuk: i always thought it should be a shell script, was never a fan of ruby-specific stuff etc
[15:48] ekryski: H4ns: very true. I kinda forgot about that ;-)
[15:48] H4ns: ekryski: so unless you have a very busy node system, you can run multiple instances on _one_ core.
[15:49] slaskis: it does make a lot of sense yah, and your bash is probably the most readable i've ever seen

[16:02] tjholowaychuk: single-line comments dont work to well for that (though you would strip them anyway)

[16:03] blessYAHU: jesusabdullah: thanks
[16:03] tbranyen: i kind of like linking my full source tho if i can
[16:03] tbranyen: minified crap just makes it harder for end users to report errors when they pop up
[16:03] tbranyen: and if you're tracking javascript errors the stack traces are useless
[16:04] jesusabdullah: blessYAHU: Oh, also, even though v0.5.x works in windows now, I'd recommend either using linux (in a vm or normal-like) or cygwin if you want to work from a windows box
[16:04] jesusabdullah: and use v0.4.x
[16:04] jesusabdullah: because 0.5.x is still unstable and you don't have npm yet
[16:04] tjholowaychuk: tbranyen yeah i dont like obfuscation much

[16:11] ekryski: ok next question.  What happens if your cpu doesn't have enough threads to handle the max i/o thread pool? (ie. 4 or 5 per instance)
[16:12] bnoordhuis: ekryski: you mean cores?
[16:12] bnoordhuis: ekryski: it doesn't matter, most of the threads will be blocked pending i/o anyway

[21:23] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: Orly?  Does it handle streaming and whatnot?
[21:23] tjholowaychuk: of course
[21:23] Nuck: I'm in the process of making a streaming multipart parser with no buffering at all
[21:23] jesusabdullah: Maybe just having a node process pull from a db would be the wtg here
[21:23] jesusabdullah: and then interact with the couch (or mongo or whatever) if you want to add/subtract comix
[21:24] Nuck: I got splitting down, though cases where the divider is in two chunks, it probably breaks

[21:25] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: Yeah, I've got a rough idea of what I gotta do, but it's a tad complex to handle

[21:25] jesusabdullah: This was one of my profs in college
[21:25] jesusabdullah: I drew so many doodles of him
[21:25] Nuck: The concept is to try every place from data.length - divider.length to the end, seeing if it matches up
[21:25] Nuck: If it does, it saves the rest of the divider to a variable and tests the next chunk

[21:49] tmedema: awesome by the way
[21:49] tjholowaychuk: jerrysv that's what happens when you have 70+ libs
[21:50] jerrysv: tjholowaychuk: yeah, i know. just funny to keep track
[21:50] Creap: I'm making a mobile app, and I'm considering "backing up" the data to web storage to have it available when the user goes offline, and then when there's a connection again the data is somehow synched between webstorage and the server
[21:50] Creap: Does that sound reasonable? Is there something like that already?
[21:51] Creap: webstorage/cookies, depending on what's available
[21:51] jerrysv: creap: like a cache manifest, coupled with localstorage?

[22:16] smathy: paveq… like if I was to ask the same question in the RoR community, they'd point me to capistrano.
[22:16] paveq: we tried joyent with push deployment, but ended with linode
[22:17] paveq: and just added "production" user
[22:17] jheusala: I seriously think I will move to use some kind of cloud deployment system which I can npm install from npm :-P
[22:17] paveq: simply run "node app.js" in screen
[22:17] smathy: paveq… no, I'm not talking about the environment setup, but tools to deploy app releases.
[22:17] smathy: paveq… eg: https://github.com/bengourley/Node-Deployment
[22:18] tjholowaychuk: smathy https://github.com/visionmedia/deploy
[22:18] tjholowaychuk: is more abstract
[22:18] tjholowaychuk: not node specific
[22:19] smathy: tjholowaychuk… you've used and it has worked well for you?

[22:19] smathy: tjholowaychuk… ha :)  Ok.
[22:20] tjholowaychuk: the one thing I'd probably change next is to get rid of GIT support and just go with tarballs
[22:20] smathy: tjholowaychuk… I wouldn't say that your opinion doesn't matter - just a caveat :)

[23:08] eldios: DrMcKay, nice
[23:08] tjholowaychuk: vicapow yeah
[23:08] eldios: anticlericalism ftw
[23:09] eldios: atheism is not enough

[23:09] MrNko has joined the channel
[23:09] eldios: believe me
[23:09] vicapow: tjholowaychuk: okay, i closed the cluster server but now it's still somehow still running
[23:09] DrMcKay: I'm just waiting to turn 18 to become atheist oficially
[23:09] tjholowaychuk: vicapow it probably did restart then
[23:09] tjholowaychuk: you can use the cli or kill it like killall -9 node etc

[23:09] jheusala: I guess I should not say I am an agnostic
[23:09] eldios: change your licence
[23:09] tjholowaychuk: vicapow it doesnt try to do any stupid require() cache magic to reload, it simply restarts
[23:09] eldios: humanity will thank you in future for that
[23:10] eldios: =)
[23:10] tjholowaychuk: which happens to background the process
[23:10] eldios: hell I knew I would pass 1AM when I sit down here -_-"
[23:10] tjholowaychuk: which actually comes in handy, you can still commit etc while your server is sitting there, but i should add an option to reload the workers only
[23:10] DrMcKay: eldios: it's MIT, but I can license it under WTFPL
[23:11] eldios: s/sit/sat/lol
[23:11] eldios: MIT is ok
[23:11] vicapow: tjholowaychuk: using the absolute path seems to have worked
[23:11] jheusala: DrMcKay: btw I wasn't baptiezed as baby. Did it 10 years old thought because of brainwash from society.
[23:11] eldios: I stopped horrified on the copyright line
[23:11] eldios: I should admit

[23:12] tjholowaychuk: vicapow yeah, just dont have a ton of syntax errors :p
[23:12] vicapow: tjholowaychuk: haha
[23:12] eldios: jesusabdullah, exactly
[23:12] DrMcKay: jheusala: in Poland you get baptism OOTB
[23:12] eldios: just to prevent other big ones to steal work from them
[23:12] eldios: OOTB?
[23:12] DrMcKay: Out of the box
[23:12] eldios: lol
[23:13] eldios: same here in Italy.. not my children anyway
[23:13] vicapow: tjholowaychuk: ;(
[23:13] eldios: vicapow, try to catch a BIG external exception
[23:13] jhurliman: once in a while my express/connect app will just crash with a socket is not writable exception in an http callback (https://gist.github.com/1179665). is there any way to prevent this from taking down the app?
[23:13] jheusala: maybe here too, if mother is part of the official church, but mine wasn't
[23:13] eldios: maybe that will catch syntax errors too
[23:13] DrMcKay: well, if I'm ever gonna have kids I'm not going to baptism them
[23:13] vicapow: eldios: you think side the cluster sever?
[23:14] DrMcKay: jheusala: well, here it looks like, well, with software license
[23:14] DrMcKay: jheusala: you just click OK and stop giving a fuck later
[23:14] jheusala: heh
[23:14] eldios: vicapow, ask that question with other words.. it was enigmatic =)
[23:15] vicapow: eldios: there's two servers. the cluster server and my node app. should i place the try {} statement around the former or the later?

[23:20] tjholowaychuk: with reload?
[23:20] tjholowaychuk: just dont save so often with syntax errors :p
[23:20] vicapow: tjholowaychuk: i thought that was all quickly the files are watched?
[23:21] slifty: yeah that's right, I'm exercising right now.  What are you gonna do about it?
[23:21] tjholowaychuk: if oyu dont save it wont reload
[23:21] eldios: vicapow, maybe you can make atwo step process
[23:21] justinTNT has joined the channel
[23:21] tjholowaychuk: but i think you can pass an interval
[23:21] tjholowaychuk: let me check

[23:27] Nexxy: it's okay though, he thinks he's a hipster
[23:27] Nuck: Nexxy: Only ironically.
[23:27] Nexxy: who said anything about a black fly?
[23:27] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: It's the hair ;)
[23:28] MaSch: mikeal: like .destroy() for any readable stream. im currently using request to stream large files. i'd like to be able to cancel the transfor by closing the request
[23:28] Nexxy: Nuck, you still haven't shown us your hair
[23:28] Nexxy: or any of you for that matter

[23:28] mikeal: so what you write isn't what it reads
[23:28] Nuck: Nexxy: Little-known fact, I'm actually a girl. </troll>
[23:28] mikeal: close() could mean the input or output, depending on state
[23:28] mikeal: the best thing to do would be to close the destination
[23:28] Nuck: But no, I have shown myself online
[23:28] Nexxy: what does that have to do with anything? lol

[23:33] qbert_: how would I capture path entries as parameters with express ?  for example listen to everything on /bangbang/*/store , and name that * parameter 'id' etc

[23:33] bnoordhuis: is sonichu a phrase i dare to google?
[23:33] Nuck: bnoordhuis: I'm not gonna

[23:40] eddanger has joined the channel
[23:40] tjholowaychuk: Nuck nice
[23:40] tjholowaychuk: they aren't too hard with formidable though
[23:40] tjholowaychuk: 3 or 4 lines
[23:40] eddanger has left the channel
[23:41] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: Aye, but with this, it'll just pipe to a file in /tmp/ (using a hash for the filename with random and timestamp and such), then set the fd on req.file.fd and unlink the file
[23:41] Nuck: So it'll be deleted as soon as they get rid of the fd
[23:42] Nuck: It's more designed for larger uploads, of course
[23:42] tjholowaychuk: i dont think you can get larger uploads than felix deals with
[23:42] Nuck: I'll probably also do a setTimeout for the file to be deleted or something
[23:43] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: Yeah, but I want to make it PHP-simple
[23:43] Nuck: By wrapping it all into one tiny package
[23:43] Nuck: With a ribbon and a bow
[23:43] softdrink: awwwwwwwwwwwwww yeah… project at work:   git clone, make setup   DONE
[23:43] Nuck: And Formidable, while nice, isn't the nicest code, and it often seems too heavyweight for many cases

[23:48] tjholowaychuk: huh
[23:48] Nuck: Didn't you say that earlier?
[23:48] tjholowaychuk: no i said i wrote an abstract multipart parser, one that isn't so focused on form-data
[23:49] tjholowaychuk: formidable is great, I just needed something for the rest
[23:49] tjholowaychuk: and most importantly formidable is battle-tested
[23:49] al3xnull has joined the channel
[23:49] Nuck: Ah
[23:50] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: You jsut mentioned boyer-moore, my mistake :P
[23:50] Nuck: I'm gonna battle-test and benchmark my module against Formidable
[23:50] Nuck: Not sure how it'll fare since I use buffertools, so I call out to C for a lot of things...
[23:50] tjholowaychuk: yeah you can use a boyer-moore derived search to skip over chunks that are not relevant
[23:50] eazyigz has joined the channel
[23:51] tjholowaychuk: multipart is somewhat retarded, as are most of the plain-text type protocols I guess
[23:51] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: I've got nothing but a high-school education in math, and my CS knowledge is all self-taught, so Boyer-Moore is a load of fancy-talk on first read :P
[23:52] tjholowaychuk: im self-taught too
[23:52] tjholowaychuk: you just pick things up as you go
[23:52] Nuck: When I say self-taught, I mean I never really talked to devs until I joined #node.js :P
[23:52] Nuck: Well, I did found a developer chat on dA, but it was 90% amateurs
[23:52] tjholowaychuk: you know you want to skip irrelevant data, and then you find out there are algos and terms for all these things haha

[23:54] bnoordhuis: are we talking about the same thing?
[23:54] bnoordhuis: boyer moore is a string search algorithm

[23:56] rootslab: that parse CSV and TXT faster than formidable
[23:56] shipit has joined the channel
[23:56] rootslab: and I have used a simple iterative parser
[23:56] Nuck: The problem is, I'd hafta adapt it for this case
[23:56] tjholowaychuk: Nuck what are you doing? just streaming through a single char?
[23:56] rootslab: The implementation is the real performance problem, I think
[23:56] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: Well, the concept is that I need to detect a beginning of the separator for multipart
[23:57] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[23:57] tjholowaychuk: that's what it's for
[23:57] Nuck: So I was thinking, check all possible locations at the end
[23:57] Nuck: I would start at buffer.length - divider.elngth
[23:57] rootslab: you have to deal with chunked data
[23:57] tjholowaychuk: you recv a chunk, scope it out by skipping around for parts of the boundary, move on or buffer if necessary blah blah
[23:57] eldios: two minutes to go
[23:58] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: The trick is, no buffering ;)
[23:58] eldios: maybe I created an useful modues =)
[23:58] tjholowaychuk: Nuck good luck
[23:58] rootslab: ha ha
[23:58] eldios: https://github.com/eldios/node-hq - node server monitoring panel
[23:58] eldios: obv is just a stub as for now
[23:58] eldios: any pull request would be welcome
[23:58] Nuck: The only things I'll buffer are headers and if it seems to be the start of a divider, I'll buffer that
[23:59] Nuck: If it turns out not to be a divider, it immediately fires 'data' when it finds out
[23:59] rootslab: nuck, if you have 24 K chunks
[23:59] Nuck: But while it buffers that bit, it already fires off the rest of the stuff until that point
[23:59] MrNko has joined the channel
[23:59] markdaws has joined the channel
[23:59] Nuck: So it's minimally-buffered, and as a result, damn-near real-time
