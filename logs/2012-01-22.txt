[00:46] bnoordhuis: i haven't been able to reproduce it
[00:46] davidbanham: bnoordhuis: Haven't tried yet, but happy to have a crack. I'm nervous about installing 
[00:47] davidbanham: v0.6.8 over my working 0.4.12 install, though. Need this machine for dev.
[00:47] bnoordhuis: davidbanham: you don't have to install it, you can run it from the source tree
[00:47] davidbanham: Should I just isolate it into a local directory? Will that provide the feedback we need?

[02:23] youngsolo: the problem is that it only accept urls starting from the root directory
[02:24] youngsolo: for example if i have a css file in my static directory i can access it using "/style.css"
[02:24] youngsolo: when i want to access it using /static/style.css

[02:24] youngsolo: static.Server(".") ?
[02:24] youngsolo: i'm not sure what you mean

[04:07] snuglepuss: bison decode is returning a boolean. what am i doing wrong?
[04:08] secoif: zzzmon I'm just comparing with my config… I have the bodyParser after methodOverride
[04:09] secoif: zzzmon i recall that being important
[04:09] secoif: zzzmon also I have { keepExtensions: true } in by body parser so it keeps the file extension
[04:09] zzzmon: secoif: I don't think that matters. This is the default with command-line express call. Also, bodyParser() works for input(type='text')
[04:09] zzzmon: so something about bodyParser is working
[04:10] secoif: zzzmon …try it

[04:16] zzzmon: secoif yeah thanks. I'll try without jade
[04:16] Aria: draginx: What does that do? (Are you using a session handler?)
[04:17] draginx: Aria: I dont think so.. im using w/e expressjs would use normally (I;m assuming it uses a memorystore by default?)
[04:17] draginx: assuming things is a bad idea :P
[04:17] draginx: i am not a clever man :o
[04:17] Aria: draginx: express defaults to "not much". It lets you build what you want more than it starts off as a huge pile.
[04:18] draginx: booooo
[04:18] draginx: ok memorystore it is :) as i do no have redis yet :D
[04:18] xbayrockx: Honestly
[04:18] draginx: or may be I do but forgot password O_o

[04:26] tbranyen: you can gzip like anything
[04:26] secoif: _ding I do that nearly daily during dev
[04:26] secoif: _ding shit breaks all the time
[04:26] secoif: best to catch early
[04:26] Aria: snuglepuss: gzip's not amazing, but it's fast enough, and generally whenever you have some somewhat-redundant text, it's a great place to start.
[04:27] secoif: _ding once I left it for a month or two, app was broken in about 10 different ways. All simple but to actually nail down what was causing the errors was a pain

[04:43] benop: running multiple instances under haproxy on each server
[04:44] benop: at the moment anyway .... 6 nodejs instances + haproxy
[04:44] markq: secoif: I'm having trouble understanding how to use the url() function inside my styl document. Or do I use it within express?

[04:46] benop: where's a good place to find a nodejs freelancer who can audit our code and help us figure out + document a deployment strategy?
[04:46] markq: basically, I already have a data base64 uri png line but in order to clean up my code area within the styl doc I thought that saving the png and using the url() function to import the png might be a better idea
[04:46] benop: you mean css url mark?
[04:47] benop: background-image: url(path/to/the/image.png);
[04:47] markq: awesome
[04:47] markq: but what is the url() function for in stylus then?
[04:47] markq: just curious
[04:47] benop: i don't know what stylus is, i just know css
[04:48] Aria: stylus is tj's awesome css metalanguage
[04:48] benop: ah okay 
[04:48] markq: is it better for performance to serve the png or serve the base64 string?
[04:48] Aria: Preprocessor for doing ninjitsu to css
[04:48] markq: that's the main question that's been bugging me
[04:48] benop: what stylus is doing is changing url(/path/to/the/image.png) to a base64 encoded image for fewer http requests
[04:48] Aria: markq: That depends on the client and the image!
[04:48] joshkehn has joined the channel
[04:48] shesek_: markq, its really only answerable on a case-to-case basis
[04:49] benop: Stylus is bundled with an optional function named url(), which replaces the literal url() calls, and conditionally inlines them using base64 Data URIs.
[04:49] Aria: base64 is more data to transfer.
[04:49] benop: yeah but fewer http requests
[04:49] benop: it's a tradeoff
[04:49] Aria: Exactly.
[04:49] markq: it's a 76 x 119 png after rendering the data uri string
[04:49] secoif: markq perhaps check out examples and tests https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus/blob/master/examples/images.styl
[04:50] secoif: markq and https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus/blob/master/examples/images.js
[04:50] shesek_: I would only use it for relatively small images, that're used only once in the CSS file and always displayed (not hidden until some action is done by the user, for example)
[04:50] benop: i would just use a spritesheet instead
[04:50] benop: and not bother with data uris
[04:50] r04r has joined the channel
[04:50] shesek_: ... and only if you don't need to support old browsers
[04:51] fomatin has left the channel

[04:51] markq: I want to repeat it x & y on the whole background
[04:51] Aria: benop: Here.
[04:51] benop: there's only like 3 people talking here lol
[04:52] markq: what's a spritesheet?
[04:52] Aria: markq: So .. do? That's a feature of background, not of url, ne?
[04:52] benop: a bunch of images joined into one
[04:52] tomtomaso has joined the channel
[04:52] draginx: benop: its a sat night..
[04:52] Aria: A spritesheet you use by sliding the background offset around, to view different parts of that image in different places.
[04:52] benop: so you have like [abcdef] and when you want 'a' you set the background image coordinate, width and height, so it only shows that portion
[04:52] Aria: So you only have to transfer one file
[04:52] Sami_ZzZ has joined the channel
[04:52] markq: that's convienient
[04:53] markq: should send all static images as one image sprite then
[04:53] Aria: If you don't need to scale them, perhaps.
[04:53] Aria: There's use cases either way.
[04:54] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[04:54] benop: i think i finally have our first nodejs api server working correctly
[04:54] secoif: benop whoo

[04:54] secoif: benop in production?
[04:54] benop: yep
[04:54] secoif: sweet.
[04:54] benop: well, 1 of 8 api servers

[04:55] brianseeders has joined the channel
[04:55] r04r has joined the channel
[04:55] secoif: benop what kinds of problems?
[04:56] benop: i think mostly just being overwhelmed, it ends up having only erratic contact with external servers which cascades down into other problems
[04:56] benop: can't even ping a server on our network reliably if i throw serious traffic at it
[04:57] mh415: Why the switch from .NET?  I assume it was already working in the previous architecture.
[04:57] benop: switch is because we do ~800 million hits a day on our API
[04:57] secoif: benop considered using node cluser?
[04:57] secoif: nice traffic
[04:57] shesek_: secoif, with or without a cluster, he shouldn't be getting those kind of issues
[04:57] benop: and .NET has all kinds of nasty stuff that gets in our way, like if *anything* goes wrong that drags requests out it can cripple an entire server getting bogged down 
[04:57] benop: here's an issue i just got
[04:58] benop: Error: EMFILE, Too many open files '/home/nodejs/com.playtomic.api/public/crossdomain.xml'
[04:58] secoif: shesek_ depends on the type of load
[04:58] benop: seen that issue many, many times
[04:58] WRAz: benop
[04:58] secoif: benop you can raise that on your server
[04:58] Aria: TIme to raise your OS's file descriptor limit?
[04:58] benop: yeah i ran ulimit -n 999999
[04:58] WRAz: increase file handlers
[04:58] WRAz: Aria++
[04:58] benop: and also ulimit -n unlimited
[04:58] Aria: Linux?

[04:59] WRAz: well, I'm mostly interested in that because they're owned by gamestop
[05:00] shesek_: benop, make sure you aren't leaking anything that should be kept per-request onto the global scope
[05:00] shesek_: that can get quite ugly
[05:00] panosru has joined the channel
[05:00] WRAz: you using codeworker to generate your api?

[05:01] Wizek-other has joined the channel
[05:01] WRAz: ACTION also works for a big company who has the problem of distributing the same API client libs in multiple languages.
[05:01] benop: shesesk the main workload is basically:  we have an array where events are stored and every second flushed to a database, and most requests put something in that array
[05:01] benop: is that going to leak something?
[05:01] r04r has joined the channel
[05:01] WRAz: weird, why not use a MQ?
[05:01] shesek_: benop, I would add some logging to check how big it gets
[05:01] shesek_: perhaps you should flush it more often
[05:02] benop: it's only 10s of entries per process (6 processes) at the moment because it's only getting a tiny slice of our traffic
[05:02] benop: although typically it's 1000 - 2000 entries then flush
[05:02] WRAz: weird architecture.
[05:02] skm has joined the channel
[05:03] shesek_: Yeah, it is a bit weird... but somewhat makes sense - most SQL servers handles bulk inserts much better than lots of single ones
[05:03] WRAz: yar, I'd toss them into a MQ or even something like kafka
[05:03] shesek_: I would try to find some other place to store them temporary, tho... perhaps [RN]edis?
[05:03] benop: it goes into mongodb
[05:04] benop: batch insert
[05:04] shesek_: Isn't mongodb already uber-fast with inserts?
[05:04] shesek_: ACTION hasn't played around with mongo as much as he'd wanted yet
[05:04] benop: yeah but doing it this way means nobody has to actually hit the database directly, their data just goes into an array and then their request is finished
[05:04] WRAz: I usually see something like kafka -> hadoop -> ??? -> profit.
[05:05] benop: data:   error: Error: failed to connect to [192.168.0.4:27017] 
[05:05] benop: that's the other error that screws us up
[05:05] WRAz: but that pattern is common in the finacial industry
[05:05] shesek_: benop, are you sure populating an array and doing bulk inserts is actually better? Any benchmarks on that before you decided?
[05:05] benop: the server stops being able to reach our own network 
[05:05] Aria: What sort of failure to connect? 
[05:05] benvie: ok, goddamn it

[05:06] sharkbird has joined the channel
[05:06] zzzmon: secoif : _ding : Just discovered what I think might be the problem: node-formidable may not be recognizing that it's a file. When I nixed the bodyParser and implemented formidable myself, it recognized it as an on('field') event rather than an on('file') event. hmm. 
[05:06] benop: ab was giving us ~2500 requests/second on a small virtual machine this way but it wasn't simulating the same load of connections
[05:06] benvie: like if I load it as a child process fork, or like anything
[05:07] Aria: Yeah, ab is a horrible benchmark.
[05:07] Aria: Nothing like reality.
[05:07] zzzmon: _ding : secoif : any insight?
[05:07] benop: time to take our nodejs node off, it's borking out again and unable to reach our own and others' servers heh
[05:07] secoif: zzzmon sorry. pehaps wait until tj gets back
[05:07] benvie: I cannot figure out the magical naughty place I need to touch to make TTY not fail outside of running as the primary process and with a TTY stdin/out
[05:08] secoif: benop Aria  yeah ab is balls, learn to use apache jmeter, much better for benchmarking
[05:08] secoif: albeit less intuitive
[05:08] shesek_: benop, those issues sounds a bit odd to me... I've been throwing much bigger loads on nodejs than what you're describing without issues
[05:08] qmx: benop: another option is tsung
[05:08] secoif: fuck jmeter has an awful interface
[05:09] qmx: ACTION still thinks jmeter is #1
[05:09] benop: yeah i know they're strange issues, it shouldn't be crapping out on a tiny workload 
[05:09] Aria: benop: Sounds like you might need better error retry logic, perhaps some internal queues for serving requests instead of going balls-out parallel; you might also need to tune your OS to allow more file handles
[05:09] shesek_: benop, I'm sure there's something wrong there... you'll have an "ahhh!" moment at some point
[05:09] benop: the "ahhh!" moment will be next week when we hire someone to audit what i've written and our deployment config and strategy hehe

[06:57] jesusabdullah: This is censorship!
[06:58] konobi: in strict mode you can still make mistakes that a decent linter will pick up... it's a false sense of security =0)
[06:58] r04r has joined the channel
[06:58] secoif: konobi sure, but it picks up on some of the nastier ones
[06:59] systemfault: If you love sloppy languages.. PHP is there for you.
[06:59] systemfault: IMHO, the strict mode is welcome.
[06:59] konobi: i like the idea... it's just an odd set of things to restrict
[07:00] secoif: konobi like?
[07:00] secoif: most of the reasoning is explained fairly well over https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Strict_mode

[07:04] systemfault: Cool... let's keep a error-prone feature for a single case.
[07:05] isaacs has joined the channel
[07:05] systemfault: I would agree if you could specify an octal number with some kind of suffix

[07:06] systemfault: I think it matters for the future... not really for es5

[07:08] luoluoluo has left the channel
[07:08] secoif: konobi also you can use parseInt to handle octals, eg parseInt('777', 8)
[07:09] secoif: konobi I mainly use it because v8 can optimise it better, and to prevent accidental globals

[13:11] secoif: krebipeti depends on your style, I'll being trying out plates on the next project https://github.com/flatiron/plates
[13:13] krebipeti: @secoif  i'm still confused...which is called client side and server side here in node.js...because from the example that i look at, we just try to make a server isn't it...which is sent html string to client
[13:13] larsschenk1 has left the channel
[13:13] krebipeti: and in my mind now....how to make this HTML string tidy is using mustache
[13:14] krebipeti: so, what do you mean by client side and back end here?
[13:14] level09 has joined the channel
[13:15] Hanspolo has joined the channel
[13:15] secoif: krebipeti it depends whether you render the jade/mustache/whatever template -> html on the serverside and simply send html to the web browser
[13:15] webben: krebipeti: typically client = a user agent (e.g. a web browser, an automated agent). backend = behind the webserver
[13:15] secoif: krebipeti  or send the client a template and let the browser convert the template into html 
[13:15] ohtogo has joined the channel
[13:16] secoif: krebipeti for example, a lot of Backbone applications don't render a lot of html on the serverside
[13:16] webben: krebipeti: If in doubt, I'd suggest rendering HTML on the server.
[13:16] secoif: krebipeti they send a template with some JSON data and let the browser apply the template to the JSON to make HTML
[13:16] webben: (Supports more users in more ways)
[13:17] krebipeti: got it secif, getting excited with this stuff
[13:17] c4milo has joined the channel
[13:17] webben: krebipeti: But it's a good idea to be thinking about how you might reuse some of that code on the client.
[13:17] webben: krebipeti: Either by sending the client fragments of HTML or by sending the client data and templates.
[13:18] webben: krebipeti: As this can have performance benefits for clients and servers in some situations.
[13:18] Vespakoen has joined the channel
[13:18] secoif: krebipeti as you're just starting out, probably best to render on server for now
[13:18] secoif: maybe.
[13:19] mange has joined the channel
[13:19] LeMike has joined the channel
[13:19] krebipeti: webben + secoif : what is the pro and cons rendering data in client vs server?
[13:20] secoif: krebipeti server rendering is simpler, and is how most web apps have been made up until recently
[13:20] webben: krebipeti: They aren't mutually exclusive. I'd tend to advise clientside rendering as a progressive enhancement on serverside rendering to improve performance in certain situations.
[13:20] webben: krebipeti: Serverside rendering works for more users in more ways, so if I was only going to build one, I'd build that.
[13:21] secoif: krebipeti client rendering generally means you need to transfer less data between client and server, as the server only needs to send JSON data and a template, not all data wrapped up in a bunch of html tags
[13:21] webben: krebipeti: e.g. some users will distrust your JS, or need to disable your JS when it causes them problems, or use clients that don't execute your JS (such as Lynx or Google).
[13:22] webben: krebipeti: For example, my organisation uses Google Spreadsheets - a lot.
[13:22] secoif: webben krebipeti  the number of people who don't execute javascript is less than IE5 users
[13:23] secoif: s/IE5/IE6
[13:23] krebipeti: i see
[13:23] webben: krebipeti: It's a serious pain in the neck that I can't access Google Spreadsheets on a remote server and download CSVs...
[13:23] krebipeti: but how does the client interpret our design??
[13:23] secoif: webben X11
[13:23] webben: krebipeti: For example, the way Google suggests making JS-dependent apps searchable is to render some HTML.
[13:24] secoif: webben google crawler executes JS these days
[13:24] webben: secoif: I don't want to install X11 on a remote server just to access Google Spreadsheets, ta.
[13:24] webben: secoif: No.
[13:24] secoif: ha
[13:24] webben: krebipeti: http://code.google.com/web/ajaxcrawling/docs/getting-started.html "HTML Snapshots"
[13:24] krebipeti: on the way sir
[13:25] N0va` has joined the channel
[13:26] webben: krebipeti: Or again, many (well let's face it: most) JS programmers are utterly incompetent at dealing with user's accessibility problems, so at least ensuring apps work without JS can help (although not an excuse for failing in the first place).
[13:26] secoif: webben I stand corrected.
[13:27] webben: As we can see, disabling JS is not a boolean operation - e.g. most of the time I am using Chrome which runs Google Spreadsheets fine ... other times, I'm trying to use their service from ELinks.
[13:27] secoif: webben http://code.google.com/apis/documents/
[13:28] secoif: webben if you really wanted you could suck them down via an api call…
[13:28] webben: secoif: Yeah, I realize I could write a Java client or install yet more random code on my servers; I'm not going to do that.
[13:28] secoif: fair enough

[13:33] tobias has joined the channel
[13:34] webben: Another way to look at it is: if you begin with a web application expressed a series of interactive documents, then you have a webservice API out of the box.
[13:35] webben: (This is one of Fielding's critical observations.)
[13:35] krebipeti: the conclusion is : on client side rendering, there will be a js that sent which has function to translate the template and json data into HTML layout. am i right?  
[13:35] webben: you don't have to require users to use tools like a Java SDK! just to pull down a document and use it.
[13:36] qsobad has joined the channel
[13:36] secoif: krebipeti yes, and that js would be mustache or whatever template tool you use
[13:36] webben: krebipeti: yeah, in clientside rendering data is transformed to HTML on the client.
[13:36] webben: krebipeti: In serverside rendering data is transformed to HTML on the server.
[13:37] krebipeti: phew...i almost lost when you sent me http://code.google.com/web/ajaxcrawling/docs/getting-started.html
[13:37] krebipeti: haha kidding
[13:37] krebipeti: but thx man...you guys really a great help...
[13:37] krebipeti: i will try to code first
[13:39] secoif: krebipeti look at Backbone/Spine/Knockout etc if you're interested in client-side rendering. Even if you dont' use these, they'll show you some best practices stuff

[13:49] sqlserverio: Ok, I'm trying to use cluster in node 0.6.7. It says to export your main app. var app = module.exports = express.createServer();? When I then tray and call cluster(app) in my server.js file I get object not a function
[13:49] secoif: webben that sounds pretty interesting, what's the stack?
[13:49] Kunda has joined the channel
[13:49] webben: secoif: (The history API means that JS-enhanced URLs are the same as static URLs, unlike the crazy hash bang stuff Twitter has going on ;) ).

[16:13] booyaa: ACTION just making sure i'm not doing the wrong way
[16:14] AndreasMadsen: sqlserverio: they build something on top of the cluster module, or stick to the 0.4, I have also been in contact with a small company there wanted to use the unstable cluster module, I'm not sure what happened, but it warned them against it.

[19:35] tbranyen: Wizek: tehy are all exes you can just add them to your path
[19:35] tbranyen: and use them in the comand line
[19:35] tbranyen: or just use linux ^_^
[19:35] Wizek: isaacs, I also tried to access the native windows installations through cygwin, and node did work, but nom had some issues
[19:37] Wizek: isaacs, e.g., cmd recognizes when I want foobar.bat if I type foobar only, but cygwin doesn't seem to. So the `*.bat`s that npm generates for windows are inaccessible this way 
[19:37] Wizek: tbranyen, I'm also considering that :)
[19:38] isaacs: Wizek: if you install msysgit, and tell it to make it work in cmd, then you get all that stuff, plus a proper bash.

[19:38] isaacs: ls
[19:38] isaacs: everything
[19:38] Wizek: isaacs, What is so wrong with cygwin anyway?
[19:39] insin: you have to use it if you want certain things in Windows, e.g. git cvsimport
[19:39] isaacs: Wizek: mostly, child processes are not handled propelry, but also random pathological performance, bad crashes that make no sense, etc.
[19:39] isaacs: Wizek: new versions of npm do not create .bat files.
[19:40] isaacs: Wizek: the latest npm that comes with node 0.6.8 creates a .cmd, as well as a msysbash-compatible sh script.

[21:03] megalomix: but i need to execute a function online ONE time.....do the job.....finish....and the it could be called again
[21:03] Lingerance: Use async or seq
[21:03] mmalecki: mutex
[21:04] megalomix: mutex ?
[21:04] megalomix: seq ?
[21:05] Lingerance: https://github.com/substack/node-seq
[21:06] megalomix: Lingerance, i only have ONE function that have to be called on time...
[21:06] megalomix: the other requests shoubl wiat
[21:06] megalomix: *wait
[21:08] booyaa_ has joined the channel
[21:08] warz: why is your function being called many times if you only want it to be called once?
[21:08] warz: or are you wanting it to be called, and then when its finished you want it to be called again?
[21:08] defied has joined the channel
[21:09] rtgibbons has joined the channel
[21:09] megalomix: warz, because it is a callback that i pass to mysqlquery function.... and mysql works async...so i can call the callback many times
[21:09] megalomix: yes, the second :)
[21:09] isaacs: megalomix: var doing = false, q = []; function doThing (args, cb) { if (doing) return q.push([args, cb]); doThing_(args, cb); }  function doThing_ (args, cb) { doing = true; gogoasync(..., function (er) { doing = false; if (q.length) { var n = q.shift(); if (n) doThing_(n[0], n[1]); }  cb(er) }
[21:09] warz: the callback should only be called when the query returns, id imagine
[21:10] Lingerance: nodejs doesn't use threading, so your function will only be run one at a time.
[21:10] tbranyen: Lingerance: does too!
[21:10] isaacs: Lingerance: but if "gogoasync" does IO, then you could have multiple messages in transit at once.
[21:10] Lingerance: Hmm?
[21:10] isaacs: Lingerance: (in my example above)
[21:10] Lingerance: isaacs: Was that for megalomix?
[21:11] isaacs: Lingerance: the example was for megalomix, but you'd said "nodejs doesn't use threading so your function will only be run one at a time"
[21:11] isaacs: Lingerance: it's still possible to do two async ops in parallel, though, and potentially cause hazards that way in some cases.
[21:12] isaacs: megalomix: the best way to solve this issue is with a boolean flag to say "i'm currently busy", and a queue of pending ops.

[21:15] dtrejo: ACTION saw signs of even fresher nodejs.org on it's way, anticipates good thangs
[21:15] megalomix: (back... let me read :))
[21:15] daneroo has joined the channel
[21:16] megalomix: yes perfect
[21:16] isaacs: megalomix: so, you turn one async function into 3.
[21:16] megalomix: i expand your code to see it better :)
[21:17] isaacs: 1) gogoasync, no knowledge of anyone else, hazardous to run two at once.  2) doThing_ private bit that sets the guard.  3) doThing public function that puts things in the queue.
[21:17] isaacs: really, doThing_ and doThing could be the same function, but separated for clarity
[21:17] isaacs: note that all three are of the form:  fn(arg, cb)
[21:17] Lingerance: ACTION is still waiting for tbranyen to back his threading claim
[21:17] isaacs: and have the contract that the cb will happen some time in the future.
[21:18] isaacs: Lingerance: node doesn't have any way for javascript programs to be preempted and have the state of their javascript objects changed mid-stream.
[21:18] isaacs: Lingerance: but buffer contents can change between one statement and the next.
[21:18] Vespakoen has joined the channel
[21:18] megalomix: perfect thank you isaacs 
[21:19] Lingerance: That sounds like a race condition waiting to heppen.
[21:19] isaacs: Lingerance: b = new Buffer([0,0,0,0]); fs.read(fd, b, 0, 4, 0, function(){}); while(true) { if (b.toString() !== "\0\0\0\0") throw new Error("wtf?") }
[21:20] isaacs: Lingerance: it's not waiting.  it happens quite fast :)
[21:20] megalomix: yes i know the is single-thread but the problem is the server....because it change a TOKEN for each request...so if i do "many" request at once it change the token AND Only one request (with that token) will be good
[21:20] stephank: praCt: new Buffer(4), I believe. In struct, 'I' is signed 32-bit?
[21:20] stephank: praCt: Oh, the write call pretty much gave it away, it's 32-bit. :)
[21:21] praCt: stephank: I is unsigned int
[21:21] madhums has joined the channel
[21:21] stephank: praCt: yeah, so just allocate 4 bytes for the buffer.

[21:58] socketio\test\67 has joined the channel

[22:00] isaacs: hammerdr: k, that should definitely work then.

[22:00] isaacs: hammerdr: compile it to javascript, and just run it with node.
[22:01] isaacs: hammerdr: i think coffee doesn't realpath() modules like node does, so symlinks are not resolved.

[22:01] hammerdr: Ah. Gotcha. I have an install script for compiling my coffeescript. Will that execute before trying to install the bin?
[22:02] isaacs: hammerdr: or, if you really really want, you can have your bin be something like:  #!env node\nrequire("coffee-script"); require("./blah.coffee")
[22:02] isaacs: hammerdr: if it's a preinstall script, yes.
[22:02] isaacs: hammerdr: but, you should do your coffeescript install as a prepublish instead.
[22:02] isaacs: hammerdr: and just run manually in dev
[22:03] isaacs: hammerdr: that way, coffee-script can be a devDependency, and users don't have to install it to use your thing.

[22:36] praCt: im looking at the following line in python "someVar = someVar2 & 0x3fffffff" is that variable declaration, where "&" concat? 
[22:36] dtrejo: back up now
[22:37] hammerdr: isaacs: Everything seems to be working great. Thanks for, as always, being so helpful.

[22:38] isaacs: hammerdr: np
[22:38] isaacs: praCt: no, that's variable declaration, where & is "binary and"
[22:38] mattgifford has joined the channel
[22:38] isaacs: er, "bitwise and" rather
[22:38] joshkehn has joined the channel
[22:38] mmalecki: what's the standard GET parameter for jsonp? jsonp or callback?
[22:38] joshkehn has left the channel
[22:38] lohkey has joined the channel
[22:38] isaacs: mmalecki: i've seen both
[22:38] isaacs: mmalecki: i think the npm registry supports ?jsonp=blah for most thing
[22:39] sotosof has joined the channel
[22:39] mmalecki: isaacs: yeah, that's how couch does it
[22:39] isaacs: (maybe that's fallen apart, though.  didn't really keep paying attention to it)
[22:39] mmalecki: but twitter does callback :/
[22:39] praCt: @isaacs: will this work the same in node.js?
[22:39] mmalecki: ACTION implements seemless jsonp in union
[22:39] bnoordhuis: praCt: up to a point
[22:40] DennisRasmussen has joined the channel
[22:41] mmalecki: isaacs: it does
[22:41] bnoordhuis: praCt: bitwise operators work in js with integers up to 2^31 or 2^32 depending on the operator
[22:41] DennisRasmussen: How would you guys crawl a website for its content? No matter what solution I try to come up with, it's terribly slow on each page request.
[22:41] praCt: bnoordhuis: i see, thank you.

[22:44] mmalecki: dtrejo: well, fuck >.<
[22:44] mmalecki: dtrejo: but thanks for reminding me
[22:44] dtrejo: haha no worries
[22:44] mmalecki: going to cut school tomorow, we'll see
[22:45] dtrejo: haha
[22:45] dtrejo: I'm missing first day of school to go to nodesummit :)
[22:45] motiooon has joined the channel
[22:45] mmalecki: dtrejo: haha :) it'd be a pita for me to get there, so not going :/
[22:45] dtrejo: i hear that
[22:46] DennisRasmussen: I usually don't ask twice (I respect the wait), but I've been working on this all day and still haven't found a working solution yet :/ I'm almost giving up
[22:46] dtrejo: (i live in the bay, so it's easy. school on east coast tho, so if I was already back, I wouldn't go, b/c lotsa flying)
[22:46] dtrejo: DennisRasmussen: hey
[22:46] dtrejo: DennisRasmussen: npm docs node.io
[22:46] dtrejo: npm docs http-agent
[22:46] dtrejo: npm docs request
[22:46] dtrejo: npm docs jsdom
[22:46] dtrejo: npm docs crawler
[22:47] dtrejo: any of those should help you out
[22:47] DennisRasmussen: Already read all of it
[22:47] dtrejo: oh
[22:47] contra: flood detected
[22:47] DennisRasmussen: and 100s of issues/requests/tickets/articles/outdated stuff etc
[22:47] tbranyen: DennisRasmussen: becaue it is slow?
[22:47] tbranyen: especially using jsdom
[22:47] DennisRasmussen: Yes
[22:47] bradleyg has joined the channel
[22:48] tbranyen: DennisRasmussen: disable its javascript exectuion
[22:48] dtrejo: node.io is faster, I think, if you don't use jsdom
[22:48] tbranyen: might help a bit
[22:48] maxogden: DennisRasmussen: node isnt the best solution for html parsing right now, but it is pretty awesome for HTTP
[22:48] kerang: what's a good way to implement proxy object in node? e.g. if i want to wrap a module and modify the behavior of certain functions
[22:48] insin: ACTION would use Scrapy as of right now
[22:48] contra: use libexpat to parse html
[22:48] DennisRasmussen: Well would it be better to create my own regex then instead of using a dom ?
[22:49] dtrejo: node.io does things for you without the slowness of a full dom, I think
[22:49] contra: why would you need a dom? there are tons of native html parsers that go fast as hell
[22:49] maxogden: DennisRasmussen: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/590747/using-regular-expressions-to-parse-html-why-not
[22:50] mightym has joined the channel
[22:50] mmalecki: html is a pita
[22:50] contra: regular expressions == horrible performance
[22:50] contra: use https://github.com/astro/ltx
[22:51] contra: just make sure you have a dtd at the top or libexpat wont parse it
[22:51] insin: FFS, w3schools is even the top hit on Google for XPATH
[22:52] DennisRasmussen: Thanks everyone. Checking out the new info/sources
[22:52] daneroo has joined the channel
[22:52] insin: the actual SPEC is #5
[22:52] contra: sorry node-expat is probably better - https://github.com/astro/node-expat
[22:52] contra: if you dont care about performance you can always use https://github.com/wearefractal/xmlson too
