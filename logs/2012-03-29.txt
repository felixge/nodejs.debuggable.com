[00:23] milani_ has joined the channel
[00:24] ag4ve: and, i think uglify is what i want (more features than packnode...
[00:24] richcollins: Any ideas why node can't find my package here?
[00:24] richcollins: https://gist.github.com/59c62607f3a441b40655
[00:25] payara: so I uglify and then do some basic encyption and make the key "copyright <me>" so they could unencrypt and reverse uglify if they wanted but because it would be a conscious step with a placed copyright notice and hint (the key) then I think legally I am about as protected as I can be

[00:27] cjm has joined the channel
[00:27] payara: the main issue for me is whether the customer starts to reuse the code in other projects without permission
[00:28] bartt has joined the channel
[00:28] TooTallNate: get better customers? :p
[00:28] TooTallNate: i kid
[00:28] payara: they have to get it as the node instance is on their server but I they would have to take definite conscious steps to ignore the copyright notice and decrypt/reverse engineer
[00:28] ljharb: payara: you have absolutely no way to stop them from doing that
[00:28] ljharb: payara: nor could you possible be liable for anything if they do
[00:28] bartt has joined the channel
[00:29] payara: no, but they would have a compliance issue
[00:29] ljharb: payara: and the only way you can get them on that is if you find a legal way of proving they've done that, which on server software is virtually impossible
[00:29] ag4ve: pokoli: as AviMarcus pointed out, i don't really think packnode is needed with uglify
[00:29] payara: big enterprises don't like compliance risk
[00:29] ljharb: the compliance risk is out of your hands once youve shipped them the server
[00:29] ljharb: if they want compliance from you, you need to be managing the server
[00:29] andrewdeandrade has joined the channel
[00:29] TooTallNate: imo, take a page out of mysql's book. Open source it; offer enterprise support
[00:29] ljharb: pretty sure that's true with anything - if you send me something, and i tinker with it, i void any warranties you have on it
[00:29] payara: no - if they use my code in their projects and this is discovered then that is not good for them
[00:30] ag4ve: in fact, look what packnode is doing - i think that can be a post processor
[00:30] ljharb: payara: correct. it's no concern of yours otherwise.
[00:30] payara: I don't mind them interfacing with the runtime of course
[00:30] ljharb: payara: it's their server. they can do whatever they want and there is nothing you can do to stop them
[00:31] ljharb: in many countries, they even have the legal right to do whatever they want at that point, including messing with the software, because they now own the server
[00:31] payara: yes, but the software delivered is part of an OEM package and they have to honour the IP delivered with that
[00:31] ag4ve: you can reverse engineer anything. but, the point is to raise the bar of shit you have to go through to extrace and reuse the code
[00:31] langworthy has joined the channel
[00:31] ljharb: payara: but there is literally nothing you can do to block them from NOT honoring the IP.
[00:31] payara: in Europe you can reverse engineer with a view to better interoperability
[00:31] payara: which is quite different from pulling out entire chunks or algorithms and working it into your own code
[00:32] ljharb: payara: if you're trying to actually prevent them from doing that, that's one thing - and the best solution the industry has found is SaaS. if you're worried about your legal liability, you have none once they start making changes.
[00:32] payara: re the compromise - I know. This is the best compromise I could come up with at present for the effort I spent
[00:32] payara: prevent may be too big a word
[00:32] payara: discourage perhaps better
[00:33] AviMarcus: it would certainly discourage.
[00:33] seanstickle has joined the channel
[00:33] AviMarcus: but if you're giving them the password to actually use it then that would mean the have the ability to decode.
[00:33] payara: yes - my other product is a SaaS one (but no node connection there yet)
[00:33] AviMarcus: I suppose there's no one-way compiling available yet...
[00:33] payara: to get uglified code - yes
[00:34] AviMarcus: ah true. uglified code is pretty darn ugly!
[00:34] payara: I think the closest I ever saw was microsoft giving you a partially encrypted VM so the standard IL would look weird
[00:35] MrTopf has joined the channel
[00:36] payara: but in general, if it executes on a machine then you can find out what it is doing and build a model of what code that compiled to that might look like (apart from on some special processor I think - but that just shifts how much effort you have to spend looking)
[00:37] ag4ve: i plan to see how i can keep people out on different levels - disk encryption, selinux, etc. but i'll be doing this at the code level too since i can

[04:06] jesusabdullah: Because it's not a middleware, but it's almost as common as middleware itself and I want to refer to such a thing in a wrapper function I'm writing

[04:07] ljharb: jesusabdullah: it's a function. that returns a middleware. call it "getMiddleware" or something

[04:15] jesusabdullah: ljharb: The verb is 'wrap'
[04:15] jesusabdullah: The metaphor is such that I'm wrapping a "thing"
[04:15] ljharb: jesusabdullah: what are you wrapping it with
[04:16] jesusabdullah: https://github.com/jesusabdullah/node-equip
[04:17] nsolsen has joined the channel
[04:17] jesusabdullah: It's an interesting use case
[04:17] ljharb: ok so "equip" both creates and wraps a middleware
[04:17] polardude has joined the channel
[04:17] ljharb: *creates a function that returns a wrapped middleware
[04:17] ljharb: and "wrapFactory" or whatever wraps the middleware that a function already returns?
[04:18] jesusabdullah: yes, equip normally wraps a middleware, but I also want to wrap the function that returns a middleware, which takes the arguments passed to the middleware generator thing and returns a wrapped middleware
[04:18] MT_ has joined the channel
[04:18] maxogden: yo dog
[04:18] ljharb: what happens if i just do app.use(function () { return equip(giveMeMyMiddleware); }); ?
[04:18] ljharb: lol
[04:18] ljharb: i mean app.use(function () { return equip(giveMeMyMiddleware.apply(null, arguments); });
[04:18] jesusabdullah: more succinctly: https://github.com/jesusabdullah/node-equip/blob/master/lib/index.js#L51-59
[04:18] jesusabdullah: Like, it's not hard, it's just a convenience method
[04:18] jesusabdullah: It totally works
[04:19] jesusabdullah: I just think "wrapFactory" isn't a very good commando name
[04:19] jsurfer_ has joined the channel
[04:19] jesusabdullah: could go to 'wrap' but that's pretty generic. Plus, equip is already a wrapper

[04:22] ljharb: is there no way to determine if a function is middleware versus returns middleware?
[04:22] jesusabdullah: not reliably
[04:22] jesusabdullah: they're both functions
[04:22] ljharb: also, what's the use case for having a function that returns a middleware versus just having a middleware itself?
[04:22] ljharb: (that does things conditionally)
[04:22] Brandon_R: hi
[04:22] jesusabdullah: ljharb: app.use(middlewarething(options));
[04:22] jesusabdullah: middlewarething is a function that returns a middleware
[04:23] jesusabdullah: and in my case, I'm making a library that exports a wrapped function
[04:23] jesusabdullah: so that express users don't need to know it's wrapped
[04:23] ljharb: jesusabdullah: app.use(equip(middlewarething(options))); ?
[04:23] jesusabdullah: no
[04:23] jesusabdullah: module.exports = equip.wrapFactory(middlewareThing);
[04:23] jesusabdullah: and then
[04:23] jesusabdullah: app.use(require('./middleware')(options));
[04:24] jesusabdullah: flatiron.app.use(require('./middleware'), options);
