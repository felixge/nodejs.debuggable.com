[00:00] chjj: it was scary when the web was on the verge of becoming xml based
[00:00] hansschmucker: I personally love XHTML
[00:00] chjj: so glad thats over with
[00:00] chjj: well...youre wrong
[00:00] chjj: very wrong
[00:00] hansschmucker: And it's not dead yet :)
[00:00] mscdex: jhtml == json html!
[00:00] chjj: xhtml is horrible
[00:00] mscdex: :p
[00:00] chjj: very terrible

[00:01] hansschmucker: HTML is worse... you have to know all implicit rules
[00:01] erichynds has joined the channel
[00:01] chjj: "all the implicit rules"?
[00:01] chjj: like implicit tags? thats all i can think of in that regard
[00:01] jesusabdullah: It is my understanding that html5 tries to codify said implicit rules
[00:01] mscdex: let's just all use a giant picture for websites along with an image map for hyperlink support
[00:01] hansschmucker: CANVAS without a separate closing tag fails on Gecko, works on Webkit
[00:01] chjj: what do you mean by implicit rules?
[00:01] erichynds: is it not possible to start a yaml key with an integer? js-yaml throws a "has not properly dedented" error
[00:01] chjj: so implicit tags you mean
[00:02] chjj: jesusabdullah: implicit tags have been specced since html2
[00:02] hansschmucker: because the Canvas tag implicitely closes itself on Webkit, but not on Gecko

[00:02] tikva has joined the channel
[00:02] jesusabdullah: chjj: They have, but this is about previously undefined behaviors that come from technically incorrect, unspecified code.
[00:02] hansschmucker: Specced yes, but I still have to remember them, when in XHTML it's just <foo/> for selfclosing <foo> for opening
[00:02] jmoyers: do you also like xml namespaces :-)?
[00:02] hansschmucker: Love them
[00:03] hansschmucker: SVG and XHTML wonderfully combined
[00:03] bergie has joined the channel
[00:03] hansschmucker: is there anything more beautiful than that
[00:03] chjj: hansschmucker: that behavior is being implemented
[00:03] chjj: for html
[00:03] jesusabdullah: I'm going to build all my web pages in photoshop! HTML5 be damned. >:O
[00:03] chjj: look at opera
[00:03] hansschmucker: I know
[00:03] hansschmucker: It's part of HTML5
[00:03] chjj: imo it should be now that DTDs have been unequivocally dropped
[00:04] chjj: which they should have been a LONG time ago
[00:04] chjj: because no html implementation was ever sgml based
[00:04] hansschmucker: Yep.... I agree on the DTD front
[00:04] chjj: but guess what, xhtml hasnt dropped them, because its still bound to the xml spec
[00:04] jonaslund: ACTION holds onto his DTD's and waves around a sword!
[00:04] hansschmucker: XHTML5 isn't
[00:04] chjj: an xml document technically is not conforming unless it has a doctype
[00:04] hansschmucker: ? That's wrong
[00:05] chjj: it doesnt even need a PI but it needs a doctype
[00:05] hansschmucker: No Doctype
[00:05] chjj: lol, let me dig up the spec...
[00:05] hansschmucker: HTML5 needs a DOCTYPE, XHTML5 doesn't
[00:05] hansschmucker: You're confusing the two
[00:05] hansschmucker: XHTML5 needs a namespace, but no DOCTYPE
[00:05] hansschmucker: HTML5 needs a DOCTYPE, but no namespace
[00:05] jonaslund: HTML5 needs an "empty" doctype for IE to fly
[00:06] jmoyers: ACTION keeps his malformed html and is happier for it
[00:06] jonaslund: otherwise IE goes into crappymode
[00:06] highermath_away has joined the channel
[00:06] hansschmucker: It's also required by the standard
[00:06] hansschmucker: But not for XHTML
[00:07] chjj: jonaslund: good point to make, its not "the html5 doctype", its simply an empty doctype
[00:07] chjj: bugs me when people call it the html5 doctype
[00:07] hansschmucker: "XML documents may contain a DOCTYPE if desired, but this is not required to conform to this specification."
[00:07] hansschmucker: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-xhtml-syntax.html#writing-xhtml-documents
[00:07] jmoyers: you know what i wish
[00:07] chjj: yeah, except thats the whatwg, not the w3c shithole
[00:07] jmoyers: i wish i had to write
[00:08] chjj: like the w3c will even acknowledge that
[00:08] jmoyers: <html: at the beginning of every tag name
[00:08] jmoyers: i wish soap was still on top of the world
[00:08] jonaslund: *shudder*
[00:08] hansschmucker: Don't really care about the W3C front... they're not working with browser vendors so who cares
[00:08] quackslike has joined the channel
[00:08] jerrysv: soap.
[00:08] jerrysv: mumps.
[00:08] hansschmucker: soap.... urgh
[00:08] jerrysv: foxpro
[00:08] hansschmucker: Not my cup of tea
[00:08] jerrysv: 3 things i'd love to see die in a fire
[00:08] hansschmucker: HTML would be one
[00:08] jonaslund: soap was a-ok if you used java
[00:09] hansschmucker: Never likes soap, never liked Java, so that would be #2 and #3
[00:09] chjj: [Definition: An XML document is valid if it has an associated document type declaration and if the document complies with the constraints expressed in it.]
[00:09] chjj: The document type declaration must appear before the first element in the document.
[00:09] jonaslund: since a code-generator did most of the crap if you had a WDSL
[00:09] chjj: http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-prolog-dtd
[00:09] jerrysv: jonaslund: i use about 6 languages a week, i prefer interoperability
[00:10] hansschmucker: "According to the XML specification, XML processors are not guaranteed to process the external DTD subset referenced in the DOCTYPE."
[00:10] quackslike has joined the channel
[00:10] chjj: hansschmucker: DUH! dtds almost never get parsed by the client
[00:10] chjj: and by almost never
[00:10] chjj: i mean never
[00:10] hansschmucker: Naturally... that's what we were talking about wasn't it
[00:10] jonaslund: jerrysv: i did some silly java (client) php (server) thing at some point and it worked okayish
[00:10] jonaslund: with minimal code
[00:10] jonaslund: but well..
[00:10] jonaslund: it wasn't entirely painless either
[00:11] hansschmucker: PHP would be nice if the parser wasn't so crappy
[00:11] jonaslund: i remember fixing the php server lib
[00:11] jonaslund: and it was sooo slow
[00:11] jonaslund: i think it could handle like 10 req's per second
[00:11] chjj: hansschmucker: im talking about xhtml still requiring a doctype, and it *always* will because its bound to the xml spec, this is ridiculous because xhtml has the benefit of triggering the xml rendering mode
[00:11] hansschmucker: ???There is no XML rendering mode???
[00:11] chjj: lol
[00:11] chjj: yes there is
[00:12] chjj: theres 4 rendering modes: quirks, almost standards, standards and xml
[00:12] hansschmucker: There's just an XML parser and a HTML parser, everything ends up as the same kind of DOM
[00:12] chjj: xml is a separate rendering mode
[00:12] hansschmucker: Quirks is separate of course
[00:12] hansschmucker: chjii, the DOM can only express XML
[00:13] hansschmucker: Make that chjj.... it's getting too late
[00:13] chjj: hansschmucker: ill prove it to you, load up an xhtml document with an internal subset, define a few entities
[00:13] chjj: then load it as html
[00:13] chjj: see if its the same behavior
[00:13] chjj: :)
[00:13] blkcat: tw
[00:13] blkcat: whoops!
[00:13] hansschmucker: Wait wait wait.... one step at a time: what do you mean by internal subset..
[00:14] chjj: for the doctype
[00:14] hansschmucker: But reading entities is PARSING behaviour, not rendering
[00:14] chjj: ??? entities arent part of the rendering?
[00:14] hansschmucker: no.
[00:14] chjj: lol
[00:15] chjj: i cant believe were arguing over the existence of xml rendering mode, this is hilarious
[00:15] hansschmucker: An entity is a string alias.... what does it have to do with rendering
[00:15] chjj: and i suppose "non-incremental RENDERING" has nothing to do with rendering either??????
[00:15] chjj: :)
[00:15] hansschmucker: the parser resolves it
[00:15] chjj: are you kidding me? its even called non-incremental RENDERING
[00:15] chjj: and you say it has nothing to do with rendering?
[00:15] hansschmucker: the parser needs the whole document to verify that it is well-formed
[00:16] jakehow has joined the channel
[00:16] chjj: ok fine, but it affects the rendering, its a rendering mode - period
[00:16] hansschmucker: So it can't render incrementally, because it has to parse first
[00:16] hansschmucker: it's a PARSING mode
[00:16] eliziario has joined the channel
[00:16] hansschmucker: not a rendering mode
[00:16] Fodi69 has joined the channel
[00:16] chjj: hansschmucker, i can write an xml parser that checks for well-formedness incrementally
[00:16] hansschmucker: of course parsing something differently means that it'll also end up being rendered differently
[00:16] chjj: in fact, i have
[00:16] hansschmucker: chjj.... no you can't
[00:16] chjj: i could write you a streaming parser that does it
[00:17] chjj: and renders incrementally
[00:17] hansschmucker: you can start, but you might have to scrap the result
[00:17] hansschmucker: because other crap came lateron :)
[00:17] chjj: hansschmucker, there have been proposes for incremental rendering for xml
[00:17] chjj: proposals*
[00:17] hansschmucker: You can do it, but it's always just speculation
[00:17] chjj: why would those exist if it were inherent to the nature of the languages parsing?
[00:18] chjj: ...
[00:18] rchavik has joined the channel
[00:18] chjj: xml mode is a rendering mode, if you dont understand that, you cant really say you know anything
[00:18] chjj: i thought this was common knowledge
[00:18] hansschmucker: You can try and abort / roll back when you find an issue, but you can't confirm that a document is well-formed until you have the whole document
[00:18] JulioBarros has joined the channel
[00:18] chjj: i cant *believe* were arguing about something so basic
[00:19] hansschmucker: chjj, it's a parsing mode... you get the same DOM for two documents that describe the same tree, even if it is written differently
[00:19] chjj: hansschmucker, i agree, you obviously cant find out whether the entire doc is well formed until its done parsing, but that DOES NOT mean you couldnt render incrementally
[00:19] hansschmucker: you could :)
[00:19] chjj: its not the same thing
[00:20] hansschmucker: but you're guessing at that point.... but you're right, that's just a theoretical problem
[00:20] syskk: xml is supposed to fail if it's malformed isnt it
[00:20] febits has joined the channel
[00:20] hansschmucker: Yep
[00:20] hansschmucker: So, you could do it, but you'd need a way to communicate back that everything you've parsed so far was utter crap because it wasn't malformed in the end
[00:20] hansschmucker: *well-formed
[00:21] darshanshankar has joined the channel
[00:21] syskk: lol
[00:21] chjj: hansschmucker, what are you talking about? you could render incremental and if you encounter a parse error, stop rendering, simple
[00:21] aho has joined the channel
[00:21] chjj: or better yet, do some kind of graceful error handling, like you should, and html does
[00:22] hansschmucker: That's something you wouldn't suggest if you valued XML :)
[00:22] chjj: also, hansschmucker: why does css behave differently on an xml document?
[00:22] chjj: an xhtml body elements properties arent propagated up to the viewport/canvas
[00:22] chjj: like they are in quirks/standards/almost standards
[00:22] chjj: interesting huh?

[00:23] hansschmucker: I'm still trying to figure out the terms you are using :)
[00:23] chjj: lol, go read the css spec then maybe we can talk
[00:23] hansschmucker: xhtml body properties... I guess you mean attributes...
[00:23] hansschmucker: Or not?
[00:23] rbranson: xml is the best. it lets me be so flexible.
[00:23] chjj: property propogation, e.g. the overflow property being propagated up to the viewport
[00:23] chjj: no
[00:24] chjj: i mean css properties
[00:24] chjj: i said css
[00:24] hansschmucker: Ahh OK, you meant the CSS properties :)
[00:24] chjj: in xhtml, the body wont propogate these properties
[00:24] amerine has joined the channel
[00:24] hansschmucker: I'd have to look that up in the source :)
[00:24] chjj: in html it does, now please, *try* to tell me that doesnt have to do with rendering
[00:24] minaguib_ has joined the channel
[00:24] chjj: what do you mean, go test it for yourself, takes 2 seconds
[00:24] chjj: i just told you how to
[00:25] hansschmucker: Could just be a namespace switch
[00:25] chjj: ...
[00:25] chjj: ive never met somebody so dishonest
[00:25] jmoyers: ACTION comes back 20 minutes later and we're still talking about xml

[00:25] hansschmucker: What did I say?
[00:25] derencius has joined the channel
[00:25] chjj: "could just be a namespace switch" - what does that even mean regarding css property propagation?
[00:25] hansschmucker: I think you're taking this all a little too serious.
[00:26] jerrysv: jmoyers: did you miss the soap conversation? if so, i can fill you in
[00:26] brettgoulder has joined the channel
[00:26] jmoyers: soap is fucking terrible, the end
[00:26] jerrysv: jmoyers: ok, so you were here for that
[00:26] jmoyers: nope
[00:26] hansschmucker: That means that the handling in Gecko is usually built in XBL and has a selector that defines when to apply a certain behavior
[00:26] jmoyers: intelligent interpolation
[00:26] jerrysv: (joke)
[00:26] rbranson: what's wrong with soap?
[00:27] rbranson: the shit makes me smell good as hell
[00:27] hansschmucker: And those selectors are sometimes based on namespace
[00:27] Tobsn: erm, urlencode in node?
[00:27] hansschmucker: Good idea.... smell... smoke.... that reminds me of something
[00:28] chjj: hansschmucker: gecko is a layout engine that supports xul, which uses xbl as a component model
[00:28] chjj: what are you trying to say?
[00:28] hansschmucker: It also uses XBL for HTML :)
[00:28] hansschmucker: and XHTML :)
[00:28] febits has joined the channel
[00:28] chjj: ...ok
[00:28] chjj: ?
[00:28] hansschmucker: Often behaviours are defined as CSS rules that apply a certain XBL
[00:28] hansschmucker: and these rules have selectors
[00:29] hansschmucker: Some of them based on the active namespace
[00:29] xSmurf has joined the channel
[00:29] JianMeng has joined the channel
[00:29] jmoyers: Tobsn: querystring.escape>
[00:29] hansschmucker: Could be that a certain rule is only active when a XHTML namespace is selected on that node.
[00:29] Tobsn: thanks!
[00:30] jmoyers: can't pass the whole url through that though
[00:30] jmoyers: it'll encode : and such
[00:30] hansschmucker: I'd have to check that... but you can look it up in the Gecko source yourself if you want.... I'm too tired for that now.
[00:30] hansschmucker: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/
[00:30] chjj: hansschmucker: what are you saying?
[00:32] hansschmucker: just that I'm tired and going for a quick smoke now.
[00:32] chjj: oh i see what youre saying, yeah it does use xbl for some of the shadow dom things internally, i misunderstood you when you said it was simply "built on xbl"

[00:36] hansschmucker: it might have to be written differently and some properties may not even be accessible if you use HTML instead of XHTML
[00:36] hansschmucker: but it all ends up as the same kind of DOM
[00:37] hansschmucker: But I still think you're taking all this too seriously
[00:37] ss23 has left the channel
[00:37] chjj: i dont dispute the dom is the same, im saying the rendering behavior is different

[00:37] chjj: which it is
[00:37] hansschmucker: Define rendering behaviour :)
[00:37] hansschmucker: It's all the same rendering
[00:37] chjj: the behavior by which something renders
[00:38] hansschmucker: The same node would render the same, but it might end up a different kind of node because of what the parser has done, for example assigning a HTML namespace :)
[00:38] chjj: this is sidetracking me from my main point anyway, xhtml is terrible

[00:39] stepheneb has joined the channel
[00:39] stepheneb has joined the channel
[00:39] chjj: html is not predictable?
[00:39] hansschmucker: XHTML will throw an error if I forget to quote an attribute. HTML will let it slide but cause undefined behaviour once a space appears
[00:40] hansschmucker: just an example
[00:40] hansschmucker: I can rule out possible errors much easier and earlier with XHTML
[00:40] hansschmucker: Error logic is just easier
[00:40] hansschmucker: HTML applies implicit rules to try and fix things
[00:41] hansschmucker: and so it may appear as if everything was working alright
[00:41] chjj: those implicit rules are defined though
[00:41] ngs has joined the channel
[00:41] chjj: there is a logic behind them
[00:41] hansschmucker: Of course they are defined
[00:41] hansschmucker: But the logic is much harder and it's much more likely that you'll make a mistake
[00:42] Country has joined the channel
[00:42] chjj: maybe once xhtml gets some kind of incremental rendering, i might consider wanting to use it
[00:42] hansschmucker: For example the strange table/p interaction... I don't remember which way around you can't define them (luckily I started past the table era)
[00:42] chjj: but even then, it would never be right for the web until it got graceful error handling
[00:42] chjj: in which case
[00:42] hansschmucker: That's exactly why I like it
[00:42] chjj: why/
[00:43] hansschmucker: No graceful error handling, just straightforward right/wrong
[00:43] chjj: you like your pages rendering as slow as possible?
[00:43] chjj: oh
[00:43] hansschmucker: No I don't like that part, but I never said I liked everything about it.
[00:44] hansschmucker: I just like the basic assumption that it's either and error or it's not.
[00:44] NetRoY1 has joined the channel
[00:44] chjj: also, xhtml and xml in general appears to be dying, with svg, mathml, and xbl2 getting ported to html
[00:44] Poetro has joined the channel
[00:44] hansschmucker: We'll see. Honestly, I don't think it's important enough to drop... 
[00:45] hansschmucker: Dropping it would mean too much trouble for too little gain, so I pretty much expect it to live forever
[00:45] chjj: im not saying drop it, im saying its dead/dying
[00:45] chjj: im not commanding anything
[00:46] hansschmucker: It's dead the moment browsers drop support
[00:46] yukihr has joined the channel
[00:46] hansschmucker: Which seems unlikely now that IE is even getting cosy with it.
[00:46] chjj: in that case the .blink() method on the string prototype is still alive in JS
[00:46] chjj: v8: 'hi'.blink()
[00:46] v8bot: chjj: "<blink>hi</blink>"
[00:46] hansschmucker: So far we never really could deploy XHTML due to IE, so we'll see what happens now.
[00:46] chjj: browsers havent dropped it! its still alive!
[00:47] hansschmucker: Exactly.
[00:47] dnolen_ has joined the channel
[00:47] chjj: alright then, xhtml will stay alive, and it will be just as useful as .blink()
[00:47] chjj: im fine with that :)
[00:48] hansschmucker: I can live with that. But we'll see. 
[00:48] gtramont1na has joined the channel
[00:48] hansschmucker: But so far we couldn't even deploy XHTML, so we'll have to wait and see what happens once IE9 gains traction among the office folks.
[00:49] jerrysv: we're still talking about xhtml?
[00:49] hansschmucker: Basically yes. :)
[00:49] chjj: honestly though, how often have things actually been dropped by implementors?
[00:49] jerrysv: hoo boy
[00:49] chjj: i dont expect it to be dropped
[00:49] hansschmucker: I'm still waiting for it to arrive.
[00:50] hansschmucker: XHTML has never been used so far since IE didn't support it...

[00:52] hansschmucker: Chicken/Egg theories :)
[00:53] chjj: ammended*
[00:53] hansschmucker: Did XHTML never take off because IE didn't support it or was it the other way around? In any case, we couldn't use it
[00:54] hansschmucker: So we'll have to wait and see what happens now that they DO support it
[00:54] chjj: well, i definitely think IE just didnt support it because its IE and its terrible

[00:54] hansschmucker: First thing we agree on :)

[01:06] hansschmucker: He doesn't call it a rendering mode either ;) Just kidding. In Firefox it simply triggers a different stylesheet 99% of the time. There may be some slight quirks, but I don't think anything but the stylesheet really causes a rendering difference... but that's really all just semantics.
[01:07] hansschmucker: No let me finally get a look at node.js ;)

[01:26] hansschmucker: Is it "!=" or assert.notEqual ? I'm curious about it too
[01:26] jmoyers: uh
[01:26] jmoyers: if you look at the source
[01:26] jmoyers: its string coerced

[01:31] jmoyers: i hadn't seen that
[01:31] hansschmucker: I was just wondering how you actually do the bindings... the ImageMagick plugin that I found seemed to just launch the binary over and over

[01:35] jmoyers: also 64 bit ints don't do so well since it cant even fit in Number
[01:35] jmoyers: well -- this is v8
[01:35] jmoyers: so no love there
[01:35] hansschmucker: There is simply an uint8 and so and and methods to split 64-bit ints into two numbers
[01:35] hansschmucker: or you can just use pointers

[02:17] fakewaffle: I keep getting this error, out of nowhere too, I think: "Error: ECONNREFUSED, Connection refused"
[02:18] fakewaffle: I don't think it can be my code, because I went back to commits a long time ago, and I still get it. I just reinstalled Node, built it, and I still get it.
[02:19] ion_: fakewaffle: does it print the stack trace?
[02:19] mscdex: fakewaffle: you must be making a network connection somewhere

[03:15] JakeSays: yeah. you're right - this channel is a ghetto.
[03:15] rbranson: just doing my part
[03:16] Nodemonster: JakeSays: Any reasons why you've chosen node.js over solutions more well-supported on Windows?

[03:17] JoshC1: JakeSays: worked pretty easy with Cygwin

[03:45] Nodemonster: yes
[03:45] frostbytten: *begs* I'm scratching my head, using express. How?
[03:45] Nodemonster: redirect with the Location: header
[03:45] willwhite has joined the channel
[03:46] frostbytten: So, if using express I would have to use that on every path?

[03:48] jacobolus has joined the channel
[03:48] frostbytten: Could I add that as middleware as well?
[03:48] adnam: frostbytten: depends on if you want to do a a http redirect or not i suppose
[03:49] frostbytten: Yeah I do, because I need them to be on the right place.
[03:49] frostbytten: So I guess only a route handler will do that?
[03:50] frostbytten: Let me try it.
[03:51] adnam: the domain name should be somewhere in `req` i suppose, and then to a `res.redirect`
[03:52] adnam: you can make a handler app.get("*" and call `next` if domain name is correct

[04:46] rbranson: ...
[04:47] Aria: Well, async IO /does/ work totally differently on Windows.
[04:47] boaz has left the channel
[04:47] JakeSays: yes, totally different is different than being broken.
[04:47] Aria: Well, the way libev does it and is prepared for /is/ broken.
[04:48] Aria: And worse, exists.
[04:48] boaz has joined the channel
[04:48] Aria: So it encourages people to use it since the API is a similar shape.
[04:48] willwhite has joined the channel
[04:48] rbranson: broken is temporary, shitty is forever
[04:49] JakeSays: so the thing to do is to implement the proper solution instead of complaining that windows isnt posix
[04:49] Aria: Evidence points to this broken being forever.
[04:49] Aria: JakeSays: And rewrite libev to be something else entirely? .oO(like libuv) 
[04:49] JakeSays: so i would say libev was the wrong choice.
[04:49] Aria: Why? It's simple and works really well.
[04:50] Aria: And wraps the unix APIs neatly.
[04:50] rbranson: as opposed to?
[04:50] JakeSays: yeah. works really well on *nix
[04:50] rbranson: libevent just uses select() on windows
[04:50] Aria: Yeah, which I don't know if you know this, but select() on windows is fail.

[04:51] Aria: JakeSays: I get the sense that you're trolling. You are aware that Ryah's working on integrating Windows IOCP, right?
[04:51] Aria: Select has its issues as an API in general.
[04:51] Aria: But Select on Windows is insane. It's JUST a toy.
[04:52] JakeSays: Aria: no, i'm not trolling.
[04:52] JakeSays: i did see mention of iocp somewhere
[04:52] rbranson: IOCP isn't going to make node work well on windows overnight though
[04:52] rbranson: still have all the infrastructure that's unix-centri
[04:52] rbranson: c
[04:52] Aria: 'kay. It just sounds a lot like you're trying to pick on every piece node uses.
[04:52] Aria: rbranson: like?
[04:52] rbranson: npm?
[04:53] rbranson: any non-trivial native extension is _LIKELY_ broken on windows
[04:53] JakeSays: Aria: no. not entirely. i'm just pushing back on all the windows haters
[04:53] Aria: Well, sure. Node hasn't integrated into Windows yet; -)
[04:53] rbranson: libev -> libuv will probably also break a lot of them by itself
[04:53] Aria: Sure.
[04:53] rictic has joined the channel
[04:54] isaacs: rbranson, sure.
[04:54] isaacs: rbranson: as it is, native modules are usually single-platform-specific
[04:54] JakeSays: Aria: as a matter of fact, its the IOCP code i'm looking for
[04:54] isaacs: rbranson: a lot of them dont' even work on all three of solaris, mac, and linux, or all linuxes even.
[04:55] rbranson: isaacs: sure, but that's a matter of testing and tweaking out small bugs
[04:55] Aria: Aaah! What are you looking in, JakeSays? node stable?
[04:55] JakeSays: Aria: git/master
[04:55] rbranson: JakeSays mistakes solid advice for hating
[04:55] Aria: You want https://github.com/joyent/libuv
[04:56] JakeSays: Aria: got that. just built it.
[04:56] Aria: Yeah. That /is/ the IOCP stuff. There's no more
[04:56] JakeSays: ok cool
[04:56] Aria: Once that works well node has to be ported to it. 
[04:56] JakeSays: rbranson: your definition of solid advice is a bit off.
[04:57] cpolis has joined the channel

[04:58] willwhite has joined the channel
[04:59] rbranson: i'm sure you'll contribute something amazing to mankind with this knowledge, i personally can't wait
[04:59] Aria: Ah, fun. Node is remarkably thin layers in places. 
[04:59] Aria: Its integration with v8 is that. It compiles a script and sets up an environment, then lets loose.
[04:59] JakeSays: rbranson: more solid advice i see.
[04:59] Aria: It's not complex. 
[04:59] rbranson: actually I'd just say I was being a dick

[05:01] azir has joined the channel
[05:02] Aria: Yes.
[05:02] Aria: Node doesn't add much but a couple macros to simplify things.
[05:02] JakeSays: ok cool
[05:02] Aria: Node is almost entirely its eventloop and network layer. The rest is almost all V8.
[05:03] k1ttty has joined the channel
[05:03] Aria: It's a small, tight, focused project. I really respect ryah for keeping it so tight despite all the temptations and pressures to add more.
[05:03] isaacs: yep.  it's just what it says.  evented IO for v8
[05:04] JakeSays: small and tight is good for sex, but not for features.
[05:04] Aria: Heh.
[05:04] isaacs: JakeSays: i disagree.
[05:04] isaacs: about the features, i mean.
[05:04] Aria: It's actually great for features when you're working in a language that has closures and is so flexible, and whose module system fits neatly into closures.
[05:04] JakeSays: you prefer big adn loose?
[05:04] JakeSays: oh. features. lol
[05:05] jesusabdullah: Definitely don't like sprawling features
[05:05] jesusabdullah: I can understand the desire for "batteries included," but the ease of installing npm and grabbing the thing you want that someone wrote mitigates that
[05:05] ChrisPartridge: isaacs: What are your thoughts on a new cmd for npm called "adddep" - which essentially adds a dependency entry into the package.json?
[05:05] jesusabdullah: Plus, some batteries kinda suck
[05:06] isaacs: ChrisPartridge: already requested.  kinda meh about it.  probably not an added command, but a flag on install.
[05:06] jmoyers has joined the channel
[05:06] mscdex: we need the sanyo eneloop of modules!
[05:06] jesusabdullah: Better to let the "free market" decide which batteries are good than to endorse any battery over the other

[05:10] Aria: Nice. Though I'd want to know why it's so slow in the first place.
[05:10] JakeSays: oh we know why
[05:10] Aria: Sounds like your usual hell of no caching anywhere, huge number of database queries.

[05:10] jslatts: anyone here talented in the ways of waf? i have a addon building problem. I cannot for the life of me figure out how to include a local dependency
[05:11] JakeSays: 10 years of bad, bad development
[05:11] Aria: jslatts: "Good luck" but I can perhaps try to help. What do you mean, a local dependency?
[05:11] pquerna: you can write bad node.js code too
[05:11] jerrysv: jakesays: sounds familiar, but you can add caching and gain a lot of life
[05:11] pquerna: don't let it fool you
[05:11] jslatts: i have a library that I need to link against
[05:11] rbranson: baby jesus is crying so much right now
[05:11] Aria: node isn't gonna be a magic bullet to fix your problems, JakeSays. It still computes at the same speed ~everything else does. Though it may be different enough to make you drop bad habits and do things well.
[05:11] jslatts: but it is just in the directory w/ my source code
[05:11] jslatts: oh, hey, its pquerna!
[05:12] pquerna: hi
[05:12] jslatts: this is jslatts from spok-vegas
[05:12] JakeSays: Aria: no, i know its not the magic bullet, but used properly, it could be very effective
[05:12] pquerna: can you github link your waf or such?
[05:12] pquerna: ah, nice
[05:12] jslatts: i will, one sec
[05:12] Aria: But, too, if it's enough of a buzzword to get buyin for a rewrite or a big-scale migration plan, that's a huge iwn.
[05:12] pquerna: not neard of spok-vegas, just spokompton
[05:12] jslatts: spokanistan?
[05:12] pquerna: ah yeah, that was pretty good
[05:13] pquerna: i think there was a shirt going around
[05:13] JakeSays: Aria: something like a nodelet - js that is spun off to render parts of a page, etc..
[05:13] mscdex: jslatts: you mean you have the source for your dependency in your project?
[05:13] Aria: JakeSays: That could help. That sounds like 'migration plan' talking more than anything.

[05:16] Aria: jslatts: you probably want to conf.check_lib in your configure, then yourtarget.uselib = ['YOURLIB'] in the build section
[05:17] JakeSays: as an experiment last summer i rewrote our accounting and customer service applications as web apps.. entire UI was rendered client side via javascript. there were 88 lines of html.
[05:17] KirinDave: rbranson: Um?
[05:17] mscdex: jslatts: so the .h files and .a in "deps/" ?

[05:18] KirinDave: rbranson: Nope.
[05:18] JakeSays: depends on what the batteries are for - if batteries come with a dildo, then thats pretty handy.
[05:18] Aria: jslatts: hm Might be that that's only for dynamic libs in the search path.

[05:22] pquerna: http://www.freehackers.org/~tnagy/wafbook/index.html#_library_interaction_uselib
[05:23] mscdex: oh, isn't that if you have waf managing the build of the dependency though?
[05:23] antlong: i have a question that i dont know enough about the terminology to ask, it involves a django admin, which has a model that takes file uploads. those files are pure js script. I was wondering if its possible to take those uploads, and while in the admin somewhere, have a section that would execute the code and return whatever
[05:23] Aria: Sure, antlong. Shell out to node (or just plain v8) and run the script ... pass back what it spits out.
[05:23] mscdex: antlong: sure, there's the 'vm' module
[05:24] Aria: (or, wrap it in a server, use the vm module, and have django send the code on over the network to node)
[05:24] rbranson: make sure you're executing as root
[05:24] pquerna: mscdex: hmm, right, well in that case still should be able to just append the .a file to obj.staticlib
[05:24] antlong: django is just kind of like the test container. what i do know - is where the files are saved
[05:24] mscdex: antlong: actually yeah shell out to a node process and use the 'vm' module in that node script
[05:24] jslatts: mscdex: that looks like it did it. well, at least it appears to link it. now i have new problems :)
[05:24] KirinDave: rbranson: Dang, the benchmarks make me curious about Warp

[05:28] KirinDave: Aria: Well assuming that they're not just chucking back 500s it almost doesn't matter.
[05:28] antlong: mscdex let me explain a bit of the structure actually
[05:29] Aria: Not hardly. This is a pathological "just send back 4 bytes" test.
[05:29] Aria: Heck, they're doing string->buffer conversion in node, and not in haskell.
[05:29] rbranson: maybe because haskell doesn't have to?
[05:29] Aria: node doesn't either.
[05:29] SubStack: haskell sure does
[05:30] niftylettuce: interpollatttionnnnn
[05:30] SubStack: it's got BufferStrings
[05:30] Aria: You can send a buffer and skip the string->buffer conversion on each hit.
[05:30] antlong: i have hundreds of json tests, the go through a binarifier, then get spit out. each one is basically one test case. i have to open a url that is set in each case, some JS is executed on the page which says pass or fail
[05:30] antlong: so i did this with selenium, and it worked - i tried it with zombie and jellyfish and it didnt
[05:30] Aria: Gotta be executed within a DOM?
[05:30] Aria: Fun!
[05:30] SubStack: no wait, bytestring it's called
[05:30] SubStack: been a while >_<
[05:31] rbranson: either way, it's not far off from what node generally benches at
[05:31] antlong: so technically i dont think i have a vm process
[05:31] KirinDave: Aria: Wait... I do not think haskell strings are what you think they are compared to Node strings.
[05:31] antlong: we have a tool that does the conversions (written in c) and the json files. the tests are assessed by whether the page says true or false when its opened
[05:31] SubStack: KirinDave: String in haskell and String in javascript are pretty comparable
[05:32] antlong: so i was hoping to be able to use node / jelly / zombie to handle that simple party
[05:32] SubStack: each does unicode
[05:32] Aria: KirinDave: Haskell's are a byte-string in this case. Node's are UCS-16. Probably. V8 strings are weird.
[05:32] KirinDave: SubStack: Strings in node are linked lists?
[05:32] yukihr has joined the channel
[05:32] yukihr has left the channel
[05:32] SubStack: *v8
[05:32] antlong: the mandatory require is javascript is parsed correctly, and a big plus would be if it was headless
[05:32] KirinDave: Aria: So why did you say Node was doing more work?
[05:32] Aria: KirinDave: Strings in v8 are chords, formatted in one of ASCII-7bit-padded-to-8 or UCS16.
[05:32] Aria: So it's converting that to a buffer to send each time.
[05:33] Aria: The haskell version is not -- it's storing a byteString, which is in network format.
[05:33] KirinDave: Okay.
[05:33] Aria: Node /has/ a network format, called ... Buffer!
[05:33] mikeal has joined the channel
[05:33] KirinDave: Aria: For Snap, that's not what its doing.
[05:33] Aria: So if they'd bothered to add one line to the script, it'd be a fair bit faster.
[05:33] Aria: Ah, I'm reading warp
[05:33] KirinDave: For Warp, i'd have to check.
[05:34] niftylettuce: i'm going to post this as an issue on github, but just in case you guys might be able to give a hand, I have defined several mixins for Stylus and it seems the mixins that are not being used in my stylesheets somehow want to get compiled as actual styles, therefore I can either comment it out or find a fix? Here is a link to the .styl file, line 33 is where I receive error on compiler, it states that n is null even though it is
[05:34] niftylettuce:  not being used http://pastie.org/private/qzyephtypbkf1fb3trvebw
[05:35] antlong: so i guess the question is, i can do it in python, and i can try with node. but node hasnt reliably worked, theres always some error junk its barfing up, but in selenium or such, there are no problems
[05:35] niftylettuce: even if i set n=1 i still get that n is null

[06:01] aah: evening.  trying to de-base64 / decrypt a string passed to me from a ruby function.   anyone done this?  ruby allows arbitrary length key / iv inputs to the underlying openssl libs, which (I think) openssl is happily truncating, while node gets very anal and requires exactly-correct-length key and IV.
[06:02] swaj has joined the channel
[06:02] aah: I've verified that the base64 method isn't the problem, and the key (while long) is equivalent to what's getting passed down in ruby, but I'm not getting.. anything usable from the decipher object.

[08:52] Rustem: Guys  I have the following problem
[08:52] mscdex: xsyn: cool
[08:53] Rustem: when I am trying to configure ./configure node.js the cygwin gives me next error: "encoding problem with BOM"
[08:53] _aron has joined the channel
[08:53] Rustem: What should I do
[08:54] OneBraveHog: install Ubuntu 
[08:54] framlin: lol
[08:54] Rustem: :) 
[08:54] temp01 has joined the channel
[08:54] pandark_: OneBraveHog: No, install Linux instead
[08:54] OneBraveHog: I had a lot of problems with Cygwin - not just with node.js either. 
[08:55] OneBraveHog: pandark - true, I shouldn't be promoting different distributions. 
[08:55] Rustem: but iam working with kinect and silverlight
[08:55] adelgado has joined the channel
[08:56] OneBraveHog: Rustem- just in case you didn't know, Oracle has a free Virtual OS app called VirtualBox  - lets you install many different OS's - free for VirtualBox - can come in handy if you want to just use linux from Windows.
[08:56] OneBraveHog: that was my ultimate solution for learning.  Still struggling to figure this all out.
[08:57] Rustem: OOOh yeap, i know. Thank you. 
[08:57] OneBraveHog: node.js is a sought after solution though, I had one recruiter call me and said this job requires node.js, I said I'm still working on figuring out how to get it working - CLICK.   I learned not to put things on my resume I'm interested in, only things I've mastered.  
[08:58] OneBraveHog: But for whatever reason - companies seem to be wanting to explore using node.js
[08:58] OneBraveHog: I am not so sure of all the benefits - yet, but I find it very interesting. SOOOOOO much to learn, I think this is the most challenging channel I've come across for me on freenode.
[08:58] Emmanuel: because JavaScript is the hype
[08:58] skohorn has joined the channel
[08:58] OneBraveHog: and perhaps rightly so.
[08:59] Emmanuel: and node and is a freaking good way of JSing
[08:59] OneBraveHog: My understanding is Javascript handles these multi-core chips well.
[08:59] OneBraveHog: maybe it's simply the 'event loop' model.

[10:01] mscdex: why is that?
[10:01] jetienne: but pacmaze is doing great, and my new game is on express so i will be a lot more on node

[10:35] mscdex: no, you don't prepend 'http' because it's already there as you can see in the example
[10:35] mscdex: it's just your hostname/ip
[10:35] mscdex: oh, wait in socket.io js code... yeah don't use http
[10:36] mscdex: so like 'localhost:8000' or something

[12:41] pandeiro: var --> buffer --> fs.write() ? surely there's an easier way? like &> log.txt in bash?
[12:41] mscdex: pandeiro: depends on how you're writing debugging output
[12:42] mscdex: you can still do redirection
[12:42] pandeiro: for now just trying to examine a req object
[12:42] mscdex: or you can use fs.open() with 'a' mode for append, then just write as much as you want and then fs.close() on process exit
[12:43] mscdex: pandeiro: console.dir(obj) will show the object's properties on stdout
[12:43] strmpnk has joined the channel
[12:44] pandeiro: mscdex: i am using console.dir but the output is unwieldy
[12:44] pandeiro: prefer to look at it in vim
[12:44] pandeiro: i will need to transfer it to a buffer manually and fs.write() then?
[12:45] mscdex: pandeiro: ok, then you can just fs.write() the contents of util.inspect(obj)
[12:45] pandeiro: ah ok, little easier i guess
[12:45] mscdex: if it's just a one time debug statement and you don't need append support, you can just use fs.writeFile

[13:15] zmbmartin: `3rdEden: ok then whatever express uses by default vs db.
[13:15] `3rdEden: ah
[13:15] zmbmartin: sorry newer to the whole sessions thing
[13:15] `3rdEden: zmbmartin expresses uses the a memory based storage :p, so it's baseically just a javascript object in memory

[13:16] `3rdEden: when your server dies all sessions will be gone
[13:16] pomodoro has joined the channel
[13:16] `3rdEden: if they are stored in a database, you wont lose them
[13:16] zmbmartin: `3rdEden: is that the only difference?
[13:16] `3rdEden: also, in a database allows you to scale across multiple processes as all process can access the sessions from the database
[13:16] lukstr: zmbmartin: it allows you to do a lot of things you might not, like what `3rdEden just said as I started typing this

[16:17] benmills: So I have this markdown parsing lib (https://github.com/benmills/robotskirt) someone is using it in express but some times it either returns an extra char at the end of the string or returns nothing
[16:17] donaldpcook has joined the channel
[16:17] benmills: I guess my real question is, what is a good way to start debugging this?
[16:18] pifantastic: benmills: I havent had that problem with node-markdown
[16:18] wookiehangover has joined the channel
[16:18] jerrysv: benmills: stupid question, are you using scope.Close() ?
[16:18] tjholowaychuk: use github-flavored-markdown or w/e
[16:18] FireFly|n900 has joined the channel
[16:18] tjholowaychuk: node-markdown doesnt support html
[16:18] tjholowaychuk: and has some other issues
[16:18] benmills: yes
[16:18] tjholowaychuk: double escaping
[16:18] benmills: I'm sure I can use other libs, this is actually a lib I'm working on personally
[16:19] pifantastic: tjholowaychuk: oh, thanks for the tip
[16:19] benmills: Its a wrapper for upskirt the c lib that github uses
[16:19] jerrysv: benmills: lots of tests that call gc liberally, with what you are parsing, what you expect
[16:19] jerrysv: benmills: run them in a tight loop with lots of gc
[16:19] benmills: ok
[16:20] benmills: Are you saying run these tests with c++ code or js code?
[16:20] jerrysv: benmills: and see if you can get a copy of the offending markdown, it may expose an issue more rapidly
[16:20] jerrysv: js code
[16:20] adambeynon has joined the channel
[16:20] benmills: It doesn't seem to be related to the markdown string, I'm able to reproduce it with any markdown string

[16:39] isaacs: hi
[16:39] Bradleymeck: so i have a question about executables with npm
[16:39] isaacs: k

[16:40] BillyBreen has joined the channel
[16:41] catshirt has joined the channel
[16:41] Bradleymeck: we have been testing our executables, and we cannot require the package that they are related to if there is a 2nd install (global or local) of it, because it will override our executable (we also cant use relative requires). Is there a decent way to use relative requires in an npm executable?
[16:41] Bradleymeck: isaacs ^ (took longer than i thought to write)
[16:42] isaacs: Bradleymeck: why can't you use relative requires?
[16:42] dingomanatee has joined the channel
[16:42] isaacs: Bradleymeck: all my executables use relative requires from the executable.  that's how it's done.
[16:42] tonyskn has left the channel
[16:42] isaacs: qv npm, semver, glob, etc.
[16:42] isaacs: er, glob doesn't have an exec, rather.
[16:42] zmbmartin: how do you get the value of a select to be the selected value in jade?
[16:43] tjholowaychuk: same way as html
[16:43] newy has joined the channel
[16:43] lukstr: zmbmartin: add a selected attribute?
[16:43] Bradleymeck: isaacs mmm i was looking in /usr/local/bin and it appeared to have just done a quick copy of the file, maybe im missing something, but it doesnt appear to be running in the right directory (sec ill dig up a gist)
[16:44] isaacs: Bradleymeck: it's a symlink
[16:44] thalll has joined the channel
[16:44] isaacs: Bradleymeck: and node does a realpath() on modules, so symlinks are safe.
[16:44] Bradleymeck: https://gist.github.com/989467
[16:45] Bradleymeck: had 2 installs of jistu, 1 being deved on, 1 as a global install, they appeared to have gotten confused
[16:45] isaacs: Bradleymeck: so... findit can't find seq?
[16:45] isaacs: is that the problem?
[16:45] wadey has joined the channel
[16:46] Bradleymeck: isaacs thats the general thing we want to solve so yea
[16:46] Bradleymeck: i put up a global install of seq after that message and it still gave that, so idk

[16:48] perezd has joined the channel
[16:48] isaacs: Bradleymeck: because just doing `npm install findit`, and then require("findit") works fine, and finds seq
[16:49] Bradleymeck:     findit = require('findit');
[16:49] Bradleymeck: and i can run findit's tests fine
[16:49] isaacs: Bradleymeck: $ node
[16:49] isaacs: > require("findit")
[16:49] isaacs: { [Function: find] find: [Circular], findSync: [Function: findSync], sync: [Function: findSync] }
[16:49] isaacs: works fine?
[16:49] isaacs: what file is doing that?
[16:49] Bradleymeck: just when i try to run the executable in /bin via the /usr/local/bin it seems to freak out
[16:50] Bradleymeck: require-analyzer/lib/require-analyzer.js
[16:50] isaacs: Bradleymeck: yeah, because those things aren't installed globally, maybe?
[16:50] maqr has joined the channel
[16:50] maqr has joined the channel

[16:50] isaacs: Bradleymeck: but require-analyzer is installed globally
[16:50] benmills: what about npm ls -g
[16:50] benmills: ?
[16:50] isaacs: Bradleymeck: npm ls -g
[16:51] isaacs: npm install require-analyzer -g, and it works for me
[16:51] samsonjs has joined the channel

[16:52] _aron has joined the channel
[16:52] benmills: If you want to install something and use it as a command (i.e. express) is there an easy way to do that without installing it globally?
[16:52] isaacs: benmills: add ./node_modules/.bin to your PATH environ
[16:52] isaacs: benmills: or run it in a "scripts" member in your package.json.
[16:52] isaacs: benmills: or install globally and just `npm link express` in the projects that require() it
[16:53] chrislorenz has joined the channel
[16:53] isaacs: Bradleymeck: OH!! your'e developing ON require-analyzer.
[16:53] isaacs: Bradleymeck: go into the folder, and do `npm link`

[16:54] nhyyhn has joined the channel
[16:54] Bradleymeck: i have both, but im trying something out, and i do have one that i ran npm link on and one that was installed from way ago, anywho i think i have a fix
[16:55] isaacs: Bradleymeck: i'm pretty sure there's no bug there.  just something wonky with your setup.
[16:55] brianc: isaacs: one thing confusing about`npm link`.  module-a you do "install . -g" and then in module-b you can "npm link module-a" right?
[16:55] tjholowaychuk: zmbmartin can i see the res.render() call?
[16:55] tjholowaychuk: or partial()
[16:55] Bradleymeck: yea, im just trying to find out whats exactly is wrong though, it may not be npms fault (most likely)
[16:55] isaacs: brianc: `npm link` (noargs) symlinks from the local -> global
[16:55] nhyyhn: Q: on nodejs.org introduction video ryan says that an array is not a proper data structure for sockets in the chat app. So what is a proper one? Are there any data structures in js bedsides arrays?
[16:56] brianc: AWESOME
[16:56] brianc: that was the killer piece i was missing
[16:56] isaacs: brianc: `npm link foo` links from foo(global) to foo(local), installing it if it's not already installed globally
[16:56] isaacs: :)
[16:57] brianc: so you can link from local to global and then from that global to another local, correct?
[16:57] pandeiro: was express.bodyParser() formerly called bodyDecoder()?
[16:57] gsmcwhirter: pandeiro, i believe so
[16:57] brianc: that helps. yesterday i kept doing "npm install . -g" on module-a so the changes would show up in module-b and was thinking "surely I am doing this wrong"  The "Warning! module-a is not a sym-link" was also a clue. :)
[16:58] isaacs: brianc: yeah, that warning is going away, since it's actually kinda common to just have a single point-of-upgrades, but link it all over.
[16:58] isaacs: brianc: bonus:  npm link ../foo <-- like (cd ../foo; npm link); npm link foo
[16:58] Bradleymeck: does link also link the executables?
[16:58] brianc: isaacs: so baller

[17:48] itissid: well I want to render basic HTML not jade templates
[17:48] itissid: i used  app.register('.html', require('jade'));
[17:48] Corren: and 10 seconds (which the article uses) to detect a crash seems kind of high
[17:48] itissid: I mean just .html files
[17:48] Corren: obviously it's editiable, but I wonder why you can't have something auto-restart on exit, rather than via polling
[17:49] tjholowaychuk: itissid that would register .html to use jade as a template engine
[17:49] Swizec has joined the channel
[17:49] tjholowaychuk: which doesnt make sense :p
[17:49] itissid: yeah
[17:49] tjholowaychuk: html is not a template engine
[17:49] itissid: I mean what do i have to do to get the HTML to be rendered as is
[17:49] tjholowaychuk: do you mean you want something like ejs? <h1><%= title %></h1> ?
[17:49] itissid: NO just old plain HTML
[17:49] tjholowaychuk: ok well use the static() middleware to serve static files or  res.sendfile()
[17:49] tjholowaychuk: though you wont be needing node if you are serving static html lol
[17:50] tjholowaychuk: but yeah avoiding the view system for that is ideal

[17:55] mAritz: tjholowaychuk: okay, because i think that's what's happening to me right now :)
[17:55] tjholowaychuk: probably just an edge case since it's pretty rare to POST without a body etc

[17:55] tjholowaychuk: sorry i forgot
[17:55] tjholowaychuk: what were talking about
[17:55] baudehlo: Corren: the one thing I wish runit could automate is some sort of alerting/emailing on process crash
[17:56] Corren: so does using runit require moving off of init.d ?
[17:56] Corren: or can they co-exist?
[17:56] Wizek: tjholowaychuk, soda/selenium
[17:56] tjholowaychuk: ohh
[17:56] tjholowaychuk: yeah we do
[17:56] baudehlo: Corren: they can co-exist, but debian does bad stuff if you install it.
[17:56] baudehlo: via apt-get anyway
[17:56] rphillips has joined the channel
[17:56] Corren: debian or ubuntu or both
[17:56] mAritz: tjholowaychuk: i would agree, however it appears that once such a request hangs, all other requests to the same url (even simple gets that shouldn't go through the bodyparser) will not be processed.
[17:57] baudehlo: no idea about ubuntu. Who uses ubuntu on servers?

[17:58] baudehlo: it will then nicely co-exist with init.d
[17:58] lukstr: startup?
[17:58] lukstr: er
[17:58] baudehlo: debian expects if you install runit, you're going to convert all your init.d stuff to runit scripts.
[17:58] baudehlo: which is annoying.
[17:58] lukstr: upstart
[17:58] Wizek: tjholowaychuk, And would you say that you build according to TDD process? Or something else?

[17:59] mAritz: tjholowaychuk: hmm.. just looked at the tests. there is a "test POST with no data". but i guess that doesn't cover the case where a GET requests is sent with Content-Type:application/json and no body. :D
[17:59] jerrysv: we're still running centos here, but run ubuntu personally
[17:59] tjholowaychuk: if all my supporting libraries are well tested then im happy

[18:01] mAritz: in that case, just ignore me :)
[18:01] mAritz: yeah, i'm going to tell him :D
[18:01] tjholowaychuk: he was just naively setting the content type at all times from what i remember

[18:07] baudehlo: but jeez, make the default a multi-page load.
[18:07] tjholowaychuk: addisonj the express repo has an example
[18:07] mAritz: tjholowaychuk: do you want me to create a github issue about this?

[19:12] whobutsb: wink_: any way to make the on('data') loop wait until the insert is finished before sending more data to the functino?
[19:12] whobutsb: wink_: thank you!
[19:13] wink_: whobutsb: there is a .drain() event you can listen for that should do what you want
[19:13] whobutsb: the drain event on the mongo insert function? 
[19:13] wink_: pass username: '', password: '' into the connect call for authing
[19:15] whobutsb: wink_: downloading now
[19:15] wink_: it fires 'drained' on the connection when it has sent all the data to mongo
[19:15] wink_: it could be extended to fire after each insert though if you wanted

[21:30] jonaslund: mickey scale!
[21:30] kschzt: jonas ^_^
[21:30] rbranson: zeromq isn't analogous to amqp/rabbitmq anyway
[21:30] kschzt: it is a messaging paradigm
[21:31] kschzt: so what I'm doing now
[21:31] rbranson: zeromq has more in common with protobuf than rabbitmq
[21:31] kschzt: what
[21:31] rbranson: you heard
[21:31] kschzt: rbranson, zeromq is 'sockets on steroids'
[21:31] kschzt: it's super cool 
[21:32] kschzt: but my main problem was I could never get any idea of presence of peers
[21:32] kschzt: you know, like, peer connected or disconnected
[21:32] kschzt: so I would handshake
[21:32] kschzt: and see oh, this guy is here
[21:32] kschzt: then continue to handshake with them
[21:32] kschzt: then they would die
[21:32] kschzt: and heartbeat messages would queue for them
[21:33] rbranson: i don't think that's the point of zmq, that would require complexity that some people don't need
[21:33] bloodsucker has joined the channel
[21:33] kschzt: someone else would connect to the same ip/port as them, with a _different identity_, ie. some totally different service picking the same port by chance 
[21:33] kschzt: and the old queue would be sent to the _wrong destination_ 
[21:34] rbranson: sounds like you're using something not designed for identity as an identity
[21:34] rbranson: last i heard HTTP didn't track clients by source IP/port either, but maybe I'm wrong
[21:34] kschzt: i was using the zeromq 'envelope' as identity, which is pretty much what it was meant for
[21:34] kschzt: nah dude that's how zeromq works
[21:35] kschzt: there's some serious peer / presence issues in the drivers
[21:35] kschzt: lots of stupid assert()s
[21:35] minaguib has joined the channel
[21:35] kschzt: read this http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2428004
[21:35] rbranson: sounds like you have some srs chops though, shouldn't be a problem to fix it up in a jiffy
[21:36] syskk: rofl
[21:36] addisonj: hehe http://github-high-scores.heroku.com/ kinda like this
[21:36] kschzt: yeah what i did, is replace all of it with node-websocket-server and node-websocket-client ^_^ :D
[21:36] kschzt: with a discovery/name service
[21:36] rbranson: websocket is web scale eh?
[21:36] kschzt: sure, it's just a tcp framing protocol
[21:36] rbranson: so it provides identity too?
[21:37] hybsch has joined the channel
[21:37] kschzt: no
[21:37] amocla has joined the channel
[21:37] kschzt: i added an identity handshake
[21:37] rbranson: oh, so you have to add that just like you would under zeromq?
[21:37] kschzt: ja
[21:37] kschzt: no, zeromq provides 'identity
[21:37] amerine has joined the channel
[21:37] Opaque has joined the channel
[21:37] kschzt: it provides an envelope, in fact, which i suppose is meant to provide trace of where the message came from
[21:38] sveimac has joined the channel
[21:38] rbranson: yeah, it tells you source IP and port, but how is that an identity?
[21:38] kschzt: but it really doesn't work right, yet
[21:38] v0idless- has joined the channel
[21:38] amocla has left the channel
[21:39] ArtistConk1 has joined the channel
[21:39] kschzt: hmm no there's the zeromq url, like tcp://127.0.0.1:1234/ that is your other endpoint you connect to
[21:39] kschzt: then you discover their identity, ONLY AFTER you first talk to them
[21:39] kschzt: which means you can't know who they are
[21:39] rbranson: sounds like you're doing the same thing with websocket
[21:39] kschzt: which is pretty much my problem
[21:39] kschzt: kinda
[21:39] kschzt: what I'm doing with websocket
[21:40] rbranson: ZeroMQ doesn't expressly provide an authentication layer
[21:40] kschzt: is I have a url like ws://127.0.0.1:12353/myServiceEndpointName/
[21:40] jeff_horton has joined the channel
[21:41] kschzt: and each Node process has 1 node-websocket-server instance, with its own http.server thing, and then serves multiple 'identity'-like endpoints
[21:41] kschzt: like in the above case, the identity of the bind() is myServiceEndpointName
[21:41] ArtistConk has joined the channel
[21:41] kschzt: then I can have ws://127.0.0.1/12353/otherEndpoint etc, which is a direct benefit of HTTP and WS  
[21:42] kschzt: one WS server port per process, multiple endpoints
[21:42] kschzt: right
[21:42] kschzt: then how easy is it now to add things like GET /stats to that, monitoring the whole system

[21:44] Country has joined the channel
[21:45] kschzt: so eliminating my final SPOF, Rabbit
[21:45] rbranson: i still don't see where ZMQ is falling short, other than in supporting HTTP
[21:45] kschzt: rbranson, identity. if identityA uses port 1024 first, then dies, I don't know, until I heartbeat-timeout them
[21:45] rbranson: you can assign identities and subscription keys with durable sockets
[21:46] kschzt: rbranson, if another peer bind()s to the same port (1024), they will be sent any pending messages regardless of their identity
[21:46] kschzt: rbranson, in my thing, the first free port will be grabbed
[21:46] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[21:46] tim_smart: kschzt: Why not just do some sort of channel system, based on the HTTP route
[21:47] kschzt: rbranson, and the clients will queue messages to those sockets indefinitely (?) and send them to whoever connects to that socket
[21:47] rbranson: erm, i don't think so
[21:47] rbranson: identities can be assigned as strings with durable sockets
[21:47] kschzt: rbranson, trust me, I debugged that one for days
[21:47] kschzt: it's a bug in zeromq or a design flaw
[21:47] kschzt: that's how it is in 2.1.7
[21:47] kschzt: the peer / identity discovery _isn't there_
[21:48] rbranson: it's rather amazing that you and you alone have finally hit the web scales enough to finally find this flaw
[21:48] kschzt: (read the HN post http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2428004)
[21:48] kschzt: tim_smart, say again?

[21:50] rbranson: i mean none of the ZMQ things I've done have ever had this problem
[21:50] itissid: Hey whats the idea behind npm installing node module in local directory?
[21:50] kschzt: well the WS solution works great, the parsing is slightly inefficient, but I can always throw in that 0x80 special packet type
[21:50] kschzt: and length-specify it
[21:51] tim_smart: itissid: Being awesome, and making deployment / bootstrap less painful.
[21:51] isaacs: kriskowal: npm handles the http_proxy variable.
[21:51] isaacs: kriskowal: node does not
[21:51] isaacs: kriskowal: you can also set the `--proxy` config explicitly
[21:52] isaacs: kriskowal: also, it doesn't differentiate between https_proxy and http_proxy
[21:52] tim_smart: Less painful that this mysql query I'm running anyway
[21:52] itissid: tim_smart, Its just that it eats a lot of space in all my projects..
[21:52] ardcore has left the channel

[21:53] kschzt: rbranson, because i always need bidirectional and there might not be a response
[21:54] itissid: tim_smart, was this done to avoid breaking different projects due to upgrades in global modules?
[21:54] caseywstark has joined the channel
[21:54] kschzt: looking forward to publishing this stuff, if I get the permission :)
[21:54] tim_smart: itissid: isaacs <-
[21:55] itissid: Like if node modules were global and accessed by multiple projects  then it would seem that updating one may break others..
[21:55] itissid: By breaking i am referring to projects..
[21:55] tim_smart: itissid: You could have different versions for different packages before I think
[21:55] brettgoulder has joined the channel
[21:56] gtramont1na_ has joined the channel
[21:56] itissid: tim_smart, AFAIR npm used to install modules as global resources no?
[21:56] duncanbeevers: itissid: Precisely. A module you depend on could depend on an older version of a module you use in the top-level project without locking the top-level project to the older version.
[21:56] isaacs: itissid: no longer.
[21:56] isaacs: itissid: now it instals them locally
[21:56] isaacs: itissid: there are many reasons for this.  the api and resulting structure is more elegant, beautiful, and easier to manage.
[21:57] kschzt: ...
[21:57] isaacs: duncanbeevers: that actually worked in npm 0.x, as well.

[21:57] isaacs: kschzt: you don't sit in your project folder hwne you'er doing stuff?
[21:57] isaacs: i do.
[21:58] itissid: isaacs, before this change was it possible that different projects referred to different versions of node modules, which were at the global level then?
[21:58] isaacs: that's where you do your git commands and open files from
[21:58] morganallen_ has left the channel
[21:58] isaacs: itissid: yes.
[21:58] itissid: and that was messy?
[21:58] isaacs: itissid: but it was not as stable or elegant.
[21:58] isaacs: yes.
[21:58] itissid: hmm
[21:58] kschzt: i usually sit in subfolders of a larger git project
[21:58] isaacs: it was always tricky to know whether or not something was still needed, etc.
[21:58] isaacs: kschzt: if you're in a subfolder of a package, it'll use the root.
[21:58] kschzt: so i am learning to use -g always 
[21:58] isaacs: kschzt: defined by the existence of a package.json or a node_modules folder.
[21:59] isaacs: that is a bad habit.  you should avoid it.

[22:24] kschzt: msdark, if you just want to buffer files to flowplayer from disk, use nginx
[22:25] ParadoxQuine: how do i quickly change where npm puts modules? i just upgraded from 0.x to 1.x and they're all in my home folder now
[22:28] wadey: perhaps I'll do 'git blame' to try to figure out why that killed check was added
[22:28] jerrysv:  /topic npm -g (if you want the old way), or just roll with it
[22:29] kschzt: jerrysv, I have to reorganise a lot of stuff to understand the new model

[22:36] isaacs: i don't expect any architectural changes in npm any time before November.

[22:38] jerrysv: isaacs: indeed!
[22:39] msdark: the idea is: I have an app in C++ to capture and process images .. with this i push the image data (RGB data) to a node.js server using thrift
[22:39] msdark: so in the node.js i have a RGB data of every frame
[22:39] kschzt: msdark, right
[22:39] msdark: now i wan't to send this data to the webpage and play wit flowplayer or html5 video tag
[22:39] isaacs: kschzt: so, where this approach really shines is if you have a bunch of different node programs with different deps.
[22:39] sechrist has joined the channel
[22:39] isaacs: kschzt: cd some-project; npm install; cd some-other-project; npm install; etc.
[22:40] msdark: so i simple send the data (raw or encode) to the webpage and with javascript put into video tag or flowplayer???
[22:40] kschzt: isaacs, I have one huge git repo with 12 big node projects, each with their own deps
[22:40] kschzt: isaacs, some shared deps of course
[22:41] kschzt: isaacs, i almost never work in the root folder
[22:41] msdark: thanks baudehlo i will try this
[22:41] isaacs: kschzt: you should probably have 12 git repos
[22:41] isaacs: kschzt: rather than one big one
[22:41] kschzt: isaacs, but npm link works, which I've always used on dev boxes, then hudson builds and my deployment scripts just have to -g that shit
[22:42] kschzt: isaacs yeah probably, it would make some things easier
[22:42] isaacs: kschzt: but, why not just cd into each of those and do your npm installing there?  ther'es no rule that says you must have 1:1 git-repo:npm-package setup
[22:42] kschzt: isaacs like deploying and killing and restarting a particular service. yes
[22:42] isaacs: as a series of "steps" to get from here to there, you could just pull out the packages to separate git repos one at a time, and have them be git submodules
[22:43] isaacs: then when the parent repo is nothing but submodules, you can kill it.
[22:43] kschzt: isaacs, I would have to do it more than 12 times .. cd into each one of them? really? no
[22:43] kschzt: isaacs, yeah, that's the better plan, 12 repos
[22:43] kschzt: 12 deployment plans ^_^ w007
[22:43] kschzt: :D
[22:44] kschzt: well it's better anyhow than 1 that incurs downtime for all 
[22:44] mscdex: msdark: have you seen this fwiw?: https://github.com/pkrumins/node-video
[22:44] kschzt: isaacs, yeah man!
[22:44] msdark: yes... mscdex i take a look
[22:44] mscdex: ok
[22:44] isaacs: kschzt: also, that has the advantage is that you don't have to check out *everything* if you only work on one or two of those
[22:44] msdark: and try to install to test but i have some issues (snow leopard)
[22:44] fakewaffle has joined the channel
[22:45] msdark: i look in to this module (node-video)

[22:45] kschzt: :s

[22:46] kschzt: yeah i think you are on to something and I've been thinking / meaning to split them
[22:46] duncanbeevers: If that * 4 thins is because you want to do the same thing to all 12 repos, it sounds like that stuff should be factored out and included as a submodule in those 12 repos, helping isolate those changes.
[22:46] msdark: ok thanks mscdex
[22:46] kschzt: it certainly makes deploying pieces much much easier
[22:46] msdark: pkrumnis your the autor of node-video right?
[22:47] msdark: i post a issue in github about installing in mac os x
[22:47] kschzt: because the "thing" as a whole doesn't change very often, but the pieces might do daily
[22:47] kschzt: and you could do daily roll-outs of a particular service, even automatically, if you pieced them out
[22:48] kschzt: for some services in certain cases you could even do hotswap :)
[22:49] kschzt: or just go to an older service, yo, this service v2 is up over there, new peeps are already using it, once you're done serving your customers, go ahead and please die
[22:49] aheckmann has joined the channel
[22:49] mscdex: msdark: i think the build error is due to the old buffer api being used
[22:50] kschzt: so a message to the older service to very gracefully die, once the new service has new clients
[22:50] mscdex: msdark: try applying this patch: https://github.com/substack/node-video/commit/4d946ce235246d96c9dc059027a0ae78b539d4e9.patch
[22:50] msdark: i don't know so much... i'm very new with node ... but i'm trying to study and understand the code of node-video
[22:50] msdark: i will try this mscdex
[22:50] softdrink: hooray for service-based architectures

[22:55] kschzt: itissid https://github.com/christkv/node-mongodb-native 
[22:55] kschzt: itissid with my patches I am using https://github.com/rocketpack/node-mongodb-native
[22:55] raynos: I'm looking for client-side npm. Is anyone working on an implementation?
[22:55] itissid: kschzt, What version of monogo is supported?
[22:55] isaacs: raynos: such a thing is a contradiction.  but perhaps EnderJS is sorta what you mean?
[22:56] raynos: isaacs: I looked at ender and found it lacking, wondered if something similar existed
[22:56] isaacs: raynos: it uses npm (server-side) to assemble a bunch of client-side libs into a nice tidy little thingie you can download.
[22:56] tjholowaychuk: raynos https://github.com/visionmedia/asset
[22:56] itissid: kschzt, i have 1.8.1 on my pc
[22:56] tjholowaychuk: might kinda be what you want
[22:56] isaacs: raynos: or you could check out browserify
[22:56] kschzt: itissid, 1.8 replica sets working fine with my driver
[22:56] itissid: Cool
[22:56] msdark: pkrumins node-video can work for my needs?? push rgb data (encode or raw) to a webpage and play into html video tag or a player (like flowplayer) ??
[22:56] kschzt: itissid, however my patches don't pass christkv's tests so start with them :)
[22:56] msdark: or i need something else (like the StreamingVideo part) ??
[22:57] itissid: kschzt, you take replica sets to be the acid test for compatibility :)
[22:57] kschzt: itissid, the replica set support however is broken
[22:57] kschzt: itissid, haha quite :D
[22:57] itissid: mongo changes a lot..

[23:03] kschzt: rauchg, i've patched mongoose a lot and haven't switched to the new version with the Builder pattern for Models (I fn hate it)
[23:03] willwhite has joined the channel
[23:03] isaacs: raynos: i don't use browserify myself.  but it seems pretty nice.
[23:03] kschzt: itissid, are you using some abstraction between node and mongo driver?
[23:04] kschzt: itissid, mongoose et al?
[23:04] isaacs: raynos: i think SubStack was talking about getting some automated thing that'll detect browserify-ability in npm packages, and then be able to filter or something
[23:04] SubStack: raynos: browserify doesn't load from npm as such, but you can use modules that you've installed with npm in it
[23:04] raynos: I just wanted a packager that allows me to package local files and files from npm. That's about it. Ender didnt play nicely with local files
[23:04] SubStack: isaacs: I sure am!
[23:04] SubStack: http://github.com/substack/testling
[23:04] kschzt: i've used mongoose a lot, but lately, as I get to know the API better and better, I've just been bypassing the Mongoose API :)
[23:04] raynos: SubStack: Oh it doesn't use npm to load them for me :( 
[23:04] msdark: bye
[23:04] SubStack: raynos: no but you just npm install them first
[23:05] mikeal1 has joined the channel
[23:05] kriskowal has joined the channel
[23:05] SubStack: you probably don't want your bundler to start installing its stuff from npm by itself

[23:05] raynos: SubStack: I guess so.
[23:06] itissid: kschzt, Abstractions not yet..
[23:06] kschzt: itissid, good :)
[23:06] blackdog has joined the channel
[23:06] itissid: Why !?
[23:07] kschzt: itissid, Hibernate experience :D 
[23:07] itissid: kschzt, Hmm Is this like django models?\
[23:07] duncanbeevers: SubStack: I'd love to see a deeper explanation of the reasoning behind some of the Browserify stuff. I was frankly shocked by the size of the generated payload.
[23:07] kschzt: itissid, yeah mongoose is kinda similar
[23:08] raynos: SubStack: Are those your drawings?
[23:08] SubStack: raynos: yes
[23:08] duncanbeevers: And lots of weird code like [].forEach(function(a) { something[a] = something['fs']; })
[23:08] kschzt: itissid, just had horrible experiences with Hibernate-like stuff that intends to completely abstract away the db
[23:08] itissid: My god so many layers of abstraction!
[23:08] SubStack: duncanbeevers: those are alises
[23:08] kschzt: itissid, don't do that!!! 
[23:08] SubStack: duncanbeevers: minifying is for minifiers
[23:08] raynos: SubStack++
[23:08] v8bot:  raynos has given a beer to SubStack. SubStack now has 31 beers.
[23:08] itissid: kschzt, Well I am guessing with JS goodness making your own custom abstraction should be a breeze..
[23:09] SubStack: duncanbeevers: the point of browserify is to let you write your browser code exactly like your node code
[23:09] hassox has joined the channel
[23:09] SubStack: because writing code for browsers sucks and writing node is awesome
[23:09] duncanbeevers: Perhaps I'm explaning myself poorly. The decision to include require in the global browser namespace seemed a little odd.
[23:09] SubStack: how else?
[23:09] tmpvar: SubStack, i must admit require('module').immediateAccess is nice
[23:09] kschzt: itissid, yeah I wouldn't be very afraid of just writing a query engine and then an implementation of that for mongodb
[23:09] SubStack: yeah require('module', cb) is crazy annoying
[23:10] tmpvar: (been working with require.js) lately
[23:10] supster has joined the channel
[23:10] tmpvar: s/) lately/lately)
[23:10] daveyjoe has joined the channel
[23:10] kschzt: itissid, especially for JS/Node/Mongo, as the model is essentially _the same_ (dynamic) .. no need to transform xml or stupid shit
[23:10] tmpvar: define(['a','b','c'], function() { return { my : module } });
[23:11] SubStack: tmpvar: you can do relative requires and everything with browserify
[23:11] tmpvar: SubStack, sounds sexy :)
[23:11] SubStack: and you can use your favorite flow control lib from npm
[23:11] tmpvar: haha
[23:11] tmpvar: conductor?
[23:11] SubStack: probably so long as it doesn't do fs or net things
[23:11] tmpvar: it does not
[23:12] kschzt: tmpvar, SubStack, what are you talking about
[23:12] kschzt: changes to require()?
[23:12] ryah: wadey: what's the sighup issue?
[23:12] pifantastic has joined the channel
[23:12] tmpvar: thats interesting, ill give it a whirl tonight SubStack 
[23:12] SubStack: kschzt: browserify
[23:13] kschzt: ah..
[23:14] raynos: SubStack: Does it extend array.prototype internally somewhere?
[23:14] SubStack: raynos: es5-shim does
[23:14] SubStack: if you're missing stuff
[23:14] raynos: Can I turn that off?
[23:14] SubStack: shim : false
[23:15] nivoc has joined the channel
[23:15] SubStack: it's in the readme
[23:15] tmpvar: it'd be interesting if you could patch the browser on a case by case basis with feature detection.. collect a list and send it to the server to get a bundle of shims
[23:16] kschzt: substack, does require() document.write() the script tag or xhr eval or css eval it? :) and do I have a choice?
[23:16] raynos: SubStack: Thanks. Should have looked at the readme, dont think it was mentioned on the website
[23:16] SubStack: tmpvar: that could be nifty
[23:16] tmpvar: kschzt, if i had to guess... none of the above
[23:16] SubStack: if you can trust the reported user-agent
[23:16] SubStack: tmpvar: correct, none of those
[23:16] SubStack: those are silly
[23:16] kschzt: uh huh?
[23:17] captain_morgan has joined the channel
[23:17] morganallen_ has joined the channel
[23:17] SubStack: kschzt: browserify is a bundler
[23:17] tmpvar: kschzt, another guess.. all of your libs are bundled ..... 
[23:17] tmpvar: hah
[23:17] SubStack: it makes a single /browserify.js file with everything
[23:17] tmpvar: cached on first load, good to go
[23:17] SubStack: yep
[23:17] kschzt: k
[23:17] kschzt: loaded how?
[23:17] tmpvar: <script src="/browserify.js"></script>
[23:18] wadey: ryah: sorry, missed your response
[23:18] wadey: I'll paste again:
[23:18] wadey: [15:08]  <wadey> ryah: is it intended that you can only call ChildProcess.kill once?
[23:18] wadey: [15:09]  <wadey> I want to send SIGHUP multiple times
[23:18] wadey: [15:09]  <wadey> but this prevents that: https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/child_process.js#L260
[23:18] kschzt: ok 
[23:18] SubStack: tmpvar: and if you specify entry points that is the only script tag you'll need
[23:19] ryah: wadey: why does that prevent it?
[23:19] ryah: oh i see
[23:19] puffpio has joined the channel
[23:19] SubStack: or you can have another script tag right after that calls require()
[23:19] ryah: wadey: yeah - we should fix that.
[23:19] tmpvar: SubStack, what do you mean by multiple entry points?
[23:19] wadey: ryah: noticed it when I was trying to have cluster send SIGHUP to the worker processes
[23:19] ryah: wadey: you can use process.kill() until we fix it
[23:19] wadey: it would work the first time
[23:20] wadey: ryah: ah, good idea
[23:20] tmpvar: SubStack: specifying them I mean
[23:20] kschzt: substack, so like a lot of the page is rendered and formed before you have access to it through browserify scripts?
[23:20] SubStack: tmpvar: the entry field to browserify()
[23:20] nivoc1 has joined the channel
[23:21] SubStack: tmpvar: like this: https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/tree/master/examples/entry
[23:21] tjholowaychuk: ryah it looks like ChildProcess#kill() has the nul signal bug
[23:21] SubStack: only has a single <script> in the index.html for that
[23:21] tmpvar: SubStack, got ya
[23:22] tmpvar: i like it
[23:22] kschzt: i don't get it tmpvar substack
[23:22] nivoc has joined the channel
[23:23] tmpvar: kschzt, where does it get fuzzy?
[23:23] SubStack: just look at the examples
[23:23] SubStack: you don't need to care how it works
[23:23] tmpvar: hahaha
[23:23] SubStack: that is the point
[23:23] kschzt: well i guess we're sending code all over the place these days from node
[23:23] kschzt: compressed, minimized, or not
[23:23] materialdesigner has joined the channel
[23:24] supster: kschzt: there's less magic going on than you think. it's just appending your scripts and defining a require() that returns the object you would expect. i think.
[23:24] pquerna: i wish i could go to offfffiiiiccce hours
[23:24] SubStack: supster: yep
[23:24] SubStack: just cats all your files together and makes require() work
[23:25] kschzt: right ok yeah
[23:25] kschzt: that's what I thought it was :)
[23:25] v0idless- has joined the channel
[23:26] SubStack: but require() works nearly exactly the same as in node, so it looks at node_modules, does relative requires, checks package.jsons for the main field, and all of that noise

[23:37] raynos: I interpreted it as require(name + "moo.js") rather then require(name "/moo.js")
[23:37] raynos: You should update it to mention folders rather then string concatenation to the front of file names
[23:37] raynos: "Preface the files in base with this name." is too vague.
[23:38] SubStack: it's like having a name field in a package.json
[23:39] SubStack: if you have a main file that name will get mapped to it
