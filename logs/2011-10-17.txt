[00:08] TheJH: jarek, could you gist your package.json and the output of "npm ls"?
[00:09] jarek: TheJH:  I have just run 'npm list -g' and it turns out that the problem is not with my package
[00:09] jarek: but with jison package (which I don't need any longer)
[00:09] jarek: jison@0.2.11 
[00:09] jarek: │ └── UNMET DEPENDENCY nomnom >= 0.4.3
[00:10] jarek: I have removed ~/.npm/jison directory, but the warning still shows up
[00:11] jarek: also, running 'npm uninstall jison' in the same directory in which I run 'npm list -g' gives me:
[00:11] TheJH: jarek, well, that's not the correct way to uninstall global stuff, I guess :D
[00:11] jarek: 'npm WARN Not installed'
[00:11] TheJH: jarek, you want "npm uninstall -g jison", I think

[00:13] ossareh: after about 2.5 days my node process takes up 100% of CPU and spits out the following: http://pastebin.com/tdNsYwjy <- I think the bundle of munmap's is telling me that I have  a memory leak and the GC is stuck in a loop trying to clean up?
[00:14] TheJH: ossareh, any idea what could be leaking?
[00:15] ossareh: I'm sure it is some of our code, if indeed it is a leak
[00:15] TheJH: ossareh, it doesn't work completely reliable, but might be worth a try: assertvanish
[00:15] TheJH: !npm info assertvanish
[00:15] jhbot: assertvanish by Jann Horn, version 0.0.3-1: assert that an object will vanish
[00:16] TheJH: ossareh, basically, it lets you say "this object should disappear within ten minutes"
[00:16] joshkehn has joined the channel
[00:16] skyl has joined the channel
[00:16] TheJH: ossareh, and it'll print a super-long reference backtree if the object is still in RAM
[00:17] ossareh: ah
[00:18] TheJH: I'm the author, but long time since I've looked at it the last time
[00:18] ossareh: The task is still the same, work out what could be not being cleared - this just lets you asset it.
[00:18] ossareh: *assert
[00:18] ossareh: thx :)

[00:20] TheJH: ossareh, so if you find out what leaks, you might be able to git bisect to find out who introduced the leak :D
[00:20] ossareh: <- introduced it
[00:20] ossareh: :)
[00:20] TheJH: :D
[00:21] ossareh: We have a couple of likely candidates 
[00:21] ossareh: I think I'll setup a testing process and have nginx dupe requests to it and see what this tells us.

[01:19] aroman1: alright so this is hopefully a less obvious question, but is there any way of getting a callback for the *entire* body, instead of chunk-by-chunk?
[01:19] aroman1: I'm making a call to a JSON api so chunk-by-chunk is definitely not helpful
[01:20] jldbasa has joined the channel
[01:20] aroman1: ..or do I just append the chunks to a string and work with it on 'end'?
[01:20] Aria: That thing you just said.

[01:20] aroman1: Aria: so the appending chunks and 'end' callback?
[01:20] Aria: Yep.
[01:21] aroman1: okay cool
[01:21] aroman1: ACTION is still wrapping his head around the node style
[01:21] Aria: Watch out for running yourself out of RAM, but that's the canonical way to do it. Or get a streaming JSON parser if you can't hold it all in RAM
[01:23] Aria: Yeah. It's one level lower-level than most people are used to thinking.

[01:30] aroman1: (I'm spoiled by Django which does this(
[01:30] Aria: Might just make sense to have a failsafe bailout. "if length of string is more than 10MB, bail"

[01:49] kurmangazy: I think I'm going to take node-expat and make it use the same callbacks

[02:04] libScout: the weird thing is that it executes fine, and renders the desired result... but then the script errors out with this "node.js:134         throw e; // process.nextTick error, or 'error' event on first tick         ^ TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of null "

[02:08] jamescarr: there are extensions on top of it I think though

[07:46] toby1: well I would like to generate a socket emit broadcast to all clients, but from a normal http incoming page request. The incoming client cannot run javascript so cannot connect to the socket.io in the normal way, but it can connect to the port

[07:51] elliottcable: switch (that) { case root:; case paws:; case arguments.callee.caller:; return false }
[07:51] robertjd: toby, so you just need an http response handler in node to send a socket event?
[07:51] elliottcable: nroot7:  ↑ wat

[07:58] elliottcable: nroot7:  that’s … not how Node works.
[07:58] elliottcable: nroot7:  you don’t control the reactor from within your tick. You setup callbacks, and once they exist, you end your tick.
[07:58] aaronmcadam has joined the channel
[07:58] elliottcable: nroot7:  when there are no more callbacks or anything, *that’s* when Node exits. If it’s exiting, that means no callbacks were ever set, no server was ever started.

[09:27] Ang3: just askinh konobi… Is thta the right way to write asycn code? http://pastebin.com/9Y5Tr5Ni 
[09:27] Shrink has joined the channel
[09:28] TheJH: Ang3, that has nothing to do yith asyncness
[09:28] TheJH: Ang3, and that's fine
[09:28] vguerra has joined the channel
[09:29] TheJH: Ang3, you only need asyncness when you use files or the network, not for such things that only change some variables or calculate stuff
[09:29] Ang3: hum the return is also good ? may i not remplace it by a callback(myObk) ?
[09:29] Ang3: k
[09:30] Ang3: callback(myObj)* 
[09:31] TheJH: Ang3, really, don't use a callback for that, it's unnecessary
[09:31] Glenjamin: TheJH: i'd say async is equally important for CPU tasks, which was the point of that whole fib debacle

[09:31] jomoho has joined the channel
[09:32] TheJH: Glenjamin, true, but not for him, he's just doing some stuff on three arrays
[09:32] Glenjamin: although knowing when to, and when not to is dark magic
[09:32] jhbot: DARK MAGIC! MUHAHA!
[09:32] Ang3: lol Glenjamin 
[09:32] TheJH: actually, I should build a bot trigger for that...
[09:32] TheJH: or maybe not
[09:32] Ang3: it looks like dark magic from outside yes :)
[09:34] konobi: Glenjamin: nothing makes cpu bound tasks easier =0)
[09:34] Ang3: ok so if i get it rught the rule is : async for manipulating file or network for simple stuff i should it the regular way ? 
[09:35] Ang3: no callback & stuff
[09:36] TheJH: Ang3, yes
[09:36] Ang3: ok !
[09:36] Ang3: thx for helping
[09:36] TheJH: Ang3, although you might want to do some special evil dark magic stuff in case you have to do really cpu-heavy stuff
[09:37] TheJH: Ang3, but most people don't need that, I think
[09:38] Ang3: well, what i want to do is a simple Kanban tool  with Jquery & Node nothing heavy

[10:58] Industrial: I have a question about REST architecture. Say you have two resources User and Monster; To add a monster to a user would you do POST /users/123/monsters/345 with the body containing a whole new monster or would you first POST /monsters/123 then POST /users/123/monsters/123 with only the ID of the already existing monster? or would you POST /monsters/123 also including a user ID in the body
[10:58] sfoster has joined the channel

[11:02] konobi: in that scenario... /users/<id>/monsters is the same as /monsters but with a user_id filter

[11:03] konobi: your POST response would contain the ID of the monster (the new resource)
[11:03] jackbean has joined the channel

[14:16] martin_sunset:  Check. Out jsdom

[15:16] ryanrolds: Glenjamin: Is it really a ruby-style fork? Sounds like he asking for a normal old fork(), the kind you seen in a lot of langauges.
[15:16] senorpedro: yeah
[15:16] fzzzy has joined the channel
[15:16] senorpedro: i want the regular childpid = fork() thing
[15:17] ryanrolds: Yeah, the kind you see in POSIX. ;)
[15:17] ryanrolds: But Ruby did do everything first.
[15:18] baudehlo1: senorpedro: I've asked for regular fork() before, and the core devs don't want to provide it because it can potentially cause problems with the event loops. I'd rather take that risk than not have it, but I kind of understand why it's not in core.
[15:18] baudehlo1: I just hate that they put an API named fork() in 0.6 and it's not a real fork() as every unix programmer understands it.
[15:18] Venom_X has joined the channel
[15:19] harthur has joined the channel
[15:19] senorpedro: ok, thx for the info
[15:19] baudehlo1: it should be easy to write a C++ extension to provide it. Don't know why nobody has done it before.
[15:19] Renegade001 has joined the channel
[15:20] baudehlo1: Also, it will never work on Windows (as it doesn't have the concept of forking a process), so it won't ever go into core now.
[15:20] ryanrolds: baudehlo1: Yeah, I can agree with the naming confusion. I just had to lookup child_process.fork() to make sure it wasn't a normal fork().
[15:20] cyrilmengin has joined the channel
[15:21] ryanrolds: That said, child_process.fork() is pretty nice. 
[15:21] baudehlo1: yeah, it should just be called something like child_process.newChildWithCommunicationChannel() ;-)

[16:18] hotch: nice thx brianc 
[16:19] brianc: senorpedro: there is a 'require('util').format' function which does the "%s, %d" substitution done in console.log but returns the result as a string.

[16:34] TheJH: pvgrif, ah, now I remember, it can't be your password - after all, all IRC clients replace it with stars when you write it. It's fun
[16:34] tjholowaychuk: hotch yea you need redis
[16:34] tjholowaychuk: it's easy to install from source
[16:34] DPG: the socket.io connection auto disconnect after 15-35 seconds...
[16:34] pvgrif: really?

[16:46] DPG: what would happen if you do this with mysql?

[16:47] yhahn has joined the channel

[16:48] pandeiro has joined the channel

[16:48] DPG: and couch won't crash?

[16:50] DPG: if i would programm something with much clients, but below 1mb data for each client.... which db should i use?
[16:50] TheJH: DPG, mongo puts the db file in virtual ram or so (so it effectively still uses the harddisk and not the RAM), but the 32-bit RAM restriction applies on all the memory mongo can see, not just the real stuff
[16:50] TheJH: DPG, depends on how your data looks

[17:16] micheil: but then again, in the US it's law to card everyone, no matter what age they are
[17:17] micheil: because it's not only the distributor, but also the person that let the offender through the door
[17:17] Aikar: nah its not, its general rule "card if looks under 40"

[17:17] Aikar: or as some stores put it "39.5"
[17:17] stepheneb has joined the channel
[17:17] micheil: usually at a bar, they will card no matter what, as if there's an inspection, and someone doesn't have a card, then you can't prove how old they actually are
[17:18] ronnieboy has joined the channel
[17:18] Aikar: some places check id at door and stamp you if underage, saves bartenders the trouble
[17:18] isaacs: in a lot of bars in the US, they card both for legal protection, as well as analytics.
[17:19] mmalecki: in our bars you can be underage, you just can't drink then.
[17:19] isaacs: ie, photograph the actual license, and then they can run metrics on where their customers live, m/f breakdown, etc.
[17:19] isaacs: it's very strict in most cities in the US, and you can get hit with a huge fine for serving someone < 21
[17:20] Aikar: though funny enough we had a social event at work where they all took us out to a pub and bought us 2 beers each, and they didnt check any ID lol
[17:20] Aikar: I guess they took the word of our employer that everyone was 21+?
[17:20] isaacs: Aikar: yeah, that's pretty common.
[17:21] jamescarr: isaacs, Aikar here's the way I see it....
[17:21] jamescarr: if you can code, you can drink :)

[17:44] eddyb: TheJH: a bad one

[17:45] Brenna1: any thoughts: How do I asynchronously process a million csv files? (applying several functions to elements in a row)
[17:45] zmbmartin: I am trying to use node-csv-parser to read a csv file and I want to save to a mongoose mongodb --> this is giving me an object is not a function error --> https://gist.github.com/1293232
[17:45] eddyb: TheJH: that fucks up the internals of the said module
[17:45] TheJH: eddyb, 
[17:45] TheJH: eddyb, maybe require('zlib/.')?
[17:46] eddyb: trying that no
[17:46] rsterner has joined the channel
[17:46] TheJH: Brenna1, what do you want to do with the results? print much data? generate statistics?
[17:46] eddyb: *now
[17:46] shurane has joined the channel
[17:46] reupertdonglebot has joined the channel
[17:46] Brenna1: generate stats
[17:47] shanebo: anyone know how to get header Content-Length from a readFile encoding UTF-8?
[17:47] TheJH: Brenna1, there are some libraries on npm for reading cvs streams that give you data events for each line, I think
[17:47] eddyb: TheJH: zlib/. works for loading the module
[17:47] Brenna1: Can I create a million objects? what csv parser and asynchronous library are best? 
[17:47] isaacs: shanebo: buffer.length?
[17:47] isaacs: shanebo: oh, utf8
[17:47] TheJH: shanebo, errrm, whut? You mean, you want to know how long the file is?
[17:47] eddyb: hmm, did something change in 0.5?
[17:47] isaacs: shanebo: Buffer.byteLength(str)
[17:48] isaacs: shanebo: or better yet, just stat the file first, and check the stat.size
[17:48] eddyb: because the module can't do require('./zlib-bindings'); to load build/Release/zlib-bindings.node
[17:48] TheJH: Brenna1, as you're just making stats, the objects that are generated can get gc'ed immediately, right?
[17:49] Brenna1: correct
[17:49] TheJH: Brenna1, then that should be no problem
[17:49] TheJH: !npm search cvs
[17:49] jhbot: no results
[17:49] TheJH: !npm search csv
[17:49] jhbot: packages (short format): watchersto, csv2mongo, csvutils, csv, ya-csv, node-csv, csvjs
[17:49] TheJH: Brenna1, hmm... I have to admit that I don't know any of them

[17:50] isaacs: vote up please: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3121553
[17:51] TheJH: isaacs, done 
[17:51] eddyb: TheJH: what's �� ?
[17:52] Brenna1: sorry. If you want to consult i can pay @brennaleeroth
[17:52] TheJH: eddyb, it's a smiley and your client uses the wrong encoding, I guess
[17:52] shanebo: isaacs, thanks, will Buffer.byteLength(str) work?
[17:53] githogori has joined the channel
[17:53] isaacs: shanebo: if you have a string, yes.
[17:53] isaacs: shanebo: but you'll be inefficient to do it that way
[17:53] shanebo: isaacs so stats is quicker?
[17:53] isaacs: shanebo: better to not specify utf8, and then get the buffer.  capture the lenght, and then do buffer.toString("utf8") if you really need the string
[17:53] isaacs: shanebo: if possible, never convert to a string.
[17:53] eddyb: TheJH: nope, yours
[17:54] eddyb: mine is utf-8
[17:54] TheJH: eddyb, hmm...
[17:54] zemanel_ has joined the channel
[17:55] shanebo: isaacs, what I'm doing is caching public files and if they're certain mime types, minifying them… hence the UTF-8. I presume that's more efficient than doing a byte to string conversion at request right?
[17:56] TheJH: eddyb, I'm usinbg utf8, too
[17:56] meandi has joined the channel
[17:56] TheJH: eddyb, maybe those smileys are newish utf8 features?
[17:56] shanebo: isaacs, so html/css/js I use UTF-8, and for images, I use binary
[17:56] isaacs: shanebo: when you say "binary", you mean you just pass along the buffer?
[17:57] joeytwiddle has joined the channel
[17:57] ambroff has joined the channel
[17:57] JasonJS has joined the channel
[17:57] isaacs: shanebo: but yes, you're doing a byte-to-string conversion every time, so if you can convert to a bufer post-minification, adn then response.end(buff), you'll get the accurate length for free off the buffer, and save doing it each time.
[17:57] shanebo: isaacs, yes I use readFile(path, callback) without encoding specified
[17:58] harthur has joined the channel
[17:58] AvianFlu: TheJH, I'm testing the "turn off tweets for specific channels" feature.  If I don't have to fix it, I'll bring in kohai.
[17:58] shanebo: isaacs, I'm also saving the buffer of an image to an object literal… is that bad? O_o
[17:58] isaacs: shanebo: that's fine
[17:58] isaacs: shanebo: it's your ram ;)
[17:59] kenperkins has joined the channel
[17:59] TheJH: AvianFlu, 
[17:59] shanebo: isaacs so I guess it leaves me with wondering whether I even need to set the Content-Length header?
[17:59] isaacs: shanebo: it's better to, yes
[18:00] isaacs: response.writeHead(200, { "content-length": buff.length, "content-type": " blah blah blah ", ... });  response.end(buff)
[18:00] isaacs: that's the ideal way to do it.
[18:00] isaacs: one big chunk
[18:00] isaacs: i mean, if you have it anyway
[18:00] isaacs: if it's a giant file, and you want to stream it out, you can do fs.createReadStream(file).pipe(response)
[18:00] AvianFlu: TheJH, whatever char that was didn't show up for me
[18:01] TheJH: AvianFlu, it was a smiley
[18:01] shanebo: isaacs, yeah that's how I'm handling images… but html/css/js, I'm saving the minified string in the object literal… in that case, how do I get content length?
[18:01] eddyb: ok, so, weird enough, relative require inside another module doesn't work
[18:01] eddyb: why?

[18:06] shanebo: isaacs, btw, all this caching happens when the server starts, and on file change I recache

[18:23] `3rdEden: gigawatt no you can't
[18:23] eddyb: require('PACKAGENAME/.') works to ignore builtin packages
[18:23] gigawatt: so i can't use like the headers for the connection and use the authorization event on the server ?
[18:23] eddyb: but then, things like module.exports = require('./build/Release/zlib-bindings'); don't work in the target package
[18:23] isaacs: eddyb: they should

Any gotchas using nginx with node for proxying,  seems like most of the failing requests are http 1.0, but not sure if that is a red herring.

[20:48] DennisRasmussen: Creating a chat here. You've got several chat rooms and several users. How would your variables/objects store the info about both? Say you have a list of rooms and a list of users and in the rooms you have a reference to the users in that room, then you would have to store a reference to the room on the user as well in case you need that information from the user, however you would have to 
[20:48] DennisRasmussen: update both references when changing room. The other solution is to have the users as a sublist of the room list but then you would have to loop through all the rooms to find a user for his/her information. Any other way of doing this?
[20:49] DennisRasmussen: Wall of text crits you for 1000!
[20:49] Aikar: ACTION reflects the attack, DennisRasmussen takes 2000 points of damage! It is super effective!
[20:50] DennisRasmussen: I just can't figure out which one is the easiest to work with. Users within rooms or a list of both with references
[20:50] DPGame: i would make 2 arrays: rooms and users.... user[id] -> all data about user... room[id] -> all data ... room[id][users] -> list of all userids of the rooms users
[20:51] DennisRasmussen: DPGame, so the reference method
[20:51] Aikar: DennisRasmussen: unless you had some new facebook killer, i dont think the size of your chat rooms will be large enough to care about memory, so it would be easy to have say var channel = { "name": "foo", users:[foo, bar, baz]}
[20:51] reid has joined the channel
[20:51] Aikar: then foo = { "name": "Aikar", channels: [chan_foo]} etc, have them link back to each other 
[20:51] DPGame: Dennis so what's the problem? ;D
[20:51] DennisRasmussen: I'm not concerned about memory or processing, but which is easier
[20:51] Aikar: and very easily references the objects from what ever angle you need
[20:52] Aikar: store an object of channels (not an array, so you can lookup channels by key (name))
[20:52] Aikar: then store an object of user
[20:52] Aikar: then each user has an array of channels hes in, which has a reference to each object
[20:52] mape: Is there a known issue running v0.5.9 on debian?
[20:52] Aikar: and each channel object has an array of users
[20:53] r04r has joined the channel
[20:53] airportyh has joined the channel

[20:53] Aikar: and if you wanna know all channels of user bob, its users['bob'].channels.forEach()

[20:53] franciscallo has joined the channel
[20:53] Aikar: yes

[20:54] DennisRasmussen: Just making sure I got it
[20:54] DennisRasmussen: Thanks
[20:55] kickingvegas has joined the channel
[20:55] Aikar: now if a user can only be in 1 room at a time, then you wouldnt need an array
[20:55] Aikar: for user[*].channels at least
[20:55] DennisRasmussen: nah that's just a property
[20:55] sub_pop has joined the channel
[20:56] Aikar: main reason you want to store from both angles is so if a new user joins a room, its a simple lookup to see whos all in the room, and if a user sends a message, its a simple path to know what channel to send to, where as if you dont store a copy of the channel on the user, youd have to scan all channels to know what channel your on
[20:57] DennisRasmussen: Yes I know
[20:57] Aikar: now you could opt to store a string of the channel name instead of an obj

[21:25] DPGame: nice =)
[21:25] Aikar: sure
[21:25] Aikar: just, the sub module that needs it will need to do a recursive require back to main
[21:25] Aikar: so...
[21:25] Aikar: if main.js has require('foo.js')
[21:26] Aikar: and foo.js needs data from main.js
[21:26] Aikar: it can do require('./main.js') BUT! only after the first tick
[21:26] Aikar: so youll need to do process.nextTick(function() { var main = require('./main'); });
[21:26] DPGame: isn't it a loop?
[21:26] Aikar: on the first tick, main hasnt finished loading yet so the vars arnt exported
[21:26] Aikar: no, modules are cached
[21:26] Aikar: so main will be in the cache, but not all exports will be filled in yet
[21:27] Aikar: for example: main.js:
[21:27] Aikar: exports.foo = 1;
[21:27] Aikar: require('./sub.js')
[21:27] Aikar: exports.bar = 1;
[21:27] boltR has joined the channel
[21:27] Aikar: if sub does require('./main')

[21:27] DPGame: ahh

[21:28] DPGame: process.nextTick(function() { var main = require('./main'); });
[21:28] Aikar: yes
[21:28] DPGame: has to be in the sub.js?

[21:28] DPGame: k

[21:56] DPGame: why ever :D
[21:56] skm has joined the channel
[21:59] brianc: DPGame: because your './' path is relative to the current working directory which is most likely wherever you started node.  __dirname is the full directory to the file in which it is typed...it varies depending on which directory the file is within

[22:00] jstash: is there a node.js "cookie jar" implementation?  looking for something that can do domain scoping and expiry
[22:00] brianc: jstash: the connect cookie middleware?

[22:07] brianc: DPGame: if you're trying to serve a static file out of the folder you might want to use connect.static() middleware
[22:07] briemens has joined the channel
[22:08] DPGame: this file wouldn't be served
[22:08] brianc: caveat being connect.static() exposes the entire directories contents to the web
[22:08] brianc: (and sub directories)
[22:08] DPGame: i wrote a http server on my own which does exactly that
[22:08] DPGame: =)
[22:09] brianc: DPGame: does it serve files out of sub directories?  Because that can be a Bad Thing.
[22:09] DPGame: yes it does
[22:09] DPGame: but all the files get's whitelisted on startup
[22:09] DPGame: so you cant load a file you musn't load
[22:10] DPGame: =)

[22:10] jocafa: anyone using cloudnode?
[22:10] DPGame: dont work
[22:10] DPGame: ERROR 404 - File not found
[22:11] DPGame: on startup the server seeks all files in my /http/  directory
[22:11] DPGame: and whitelist them
[22:11] DPGame: and cache them
[22:11] DPGame: so the server can answer quickly to requests 
[22:11] DPGame: and because of startup whitelisting it cant access other dirs

[22:38] LeCamarade: Like, one that will synchronise messages for printing. I want to spawn it at the top, then give it the messages at random, knowing it will not receive-and-process more than one at a time.
[22:39] LeCamarade: We do it with a spawned process in Erlang.

[22:40] LeCamarade: tjholowaychuk: So what do you use where you would need lightweight processes?
[22:40] zmbmartin: I am really bad with regex how can I match and replace "Section 2: " in this string -> "Section 2: Site And Water" I just want to return everything after ": "?
[22:40] nerdy_ has joined the channel
[22:41] LeCamarade: Surely it cannot be that spinlock or call an external in every such case.
[22:41] __tosh has joined the channel
[22:41] amigojapan has joined the channel
[22:41] LeCamarade: zmbmartin: The regex is this:
[22:41] LeCamarade: /:.*$/
[22:42] LeCamarade: zmbmartin: So, for example, the following:
[22:43] LeCamarade: 'Section 2: Man and Water'.replace(/:.*$/, '');
[22:43] LeCamarade: Results in:
[22:43] shykes_ has joined the channel
[22:43] LeCamarade: Section 2
[22:43] LeCamarade: zmbmartin: Works for you?
[22:43] eignerchris has joined the channel
[22:44] piscisaureus_ has joined the channel
[22:44] zmbmartin: LeCamarade: I actually want to part after the ": " to return not the part before.
[22:45] LeCamarade: zmbmartin: Also easy, use /^[^:]*/
[22:45] _kud has joined the channel
[22:45] LeCamarade: Example:
[22:47] zmbmartin: LeCamarade: Thank you that still leaves the ": " on so if I have "This is: Another part" it returns ": Another part"
[22:47] LeCamarade: zmbmartin: Changed it, here is the solution:
[22:47] LeCamarade: rez = 'Section 2: Man and Water'.match(/: (.*)$/, '$1');
[22:47] LeCamarade: rez[1]
[22:47] LeCamarade: ;
[22:48] LeCamarade: Voilà.
[22:48] LeCamarade: Works for you?
