[01:13] MooGoo: by using global variables
[01:13] Lingerance: Yes, but you won't be able to access them with the REPL. Just put them in globals

[01:14] sechrist: so for all of the people I work with, I still find nearly every frontend person doesn't know about setting breakpoints in browsers

[01:14] detaos: i tried putting a global variable in a script that included a module ... the code in the included module couldn't see the global variable.
[01:14] sechrist: when they don't need to
[01:14] MooGoo: sechrist: you can get pretty far with just console.log
[01:15] piscisaureus has joined the channel
[01:15] sechrist: sure but then you're dealing with caching problems if you didn't think about that in advance
[01:15] MooGoo: uh

[01:15] Destos has joined the channel
[01:16] sechrist: well if you have something that isn't setting cache control or reloads upon change

[01:17] sechrist: but like, so many people I know edit code directly on shared hosting
[01:17] sechrist: from within their client
[01:17] MooGoo: wait, so you're saying you need to use a debugger cause your cache control is messed up
[01:17] sechrist: haha no
[01:17] sechrist: i'm saying you can see troubleshoot exactly what's running, as it runs

[01:22] sechrist: neat
[01:23] MooGoo: lol no
[01:23] hdon: actually i was curious to see an example of a Node application that incorporated <canvas> into a user interface
[01:23] MooGoo: any node app could
[01:23] zemanel has joined the channel
[01:23] MooGoo: or...any other app
[01:23] hdon: any node app that does?
[01:23] MooGoo: sometimes node acts as a game server for canvas multiplayer games
[01:23] MooGoo: hell if I have an example
[01:23] dreamdust: That's client-side… pretty sure http://code.google.com/p/flot/ uses canvas. We use it for graphs.
[01:24] MooGoo: but client canvas is pretty far detached from nodejs
[01:24] MooGoo: well you can get that cario module
[01:24] MooGoo: but thats still server
[01:25] hdon: MooGoo, well the thing is i'd kind of like to be able to deploy an app without telling someone to download a browser, or need an HTTP server, etc
[01:25] fbartho has joined the channel

[01:25] storrgie has joined the channel
[01:25] hdon: websockets don't do udp
[01:25] MooGoo: most server side API's have better network support than browser JS yes
[01:26] sechrist: you don't want browsers to do udp
[01:26] hdon: haha, yeah i suppose without taking the right security measures...
[01:26] hdon: you'd probably see a lot of transient ddos-capable botnets
[01:26] MooGoo: well it would certinly be nice if my client js could open raw sockets and stuff
[01:27] sechrist: well even that, and what are you going to do with udp that doesn't need to be reliable? which means you need to build in a sequencer anyway
[01:27] konobi: kedge?
[01:27] hdon: MooGoo, if you can stand going through a proxy, you could unwrap the raw socket data from the \x00 and \xFF
[01:27] broofa has joined the channel
[01:27] MooGoo: what a pain
[01:27] hdon: sechrist, games, obviously
[01:27] hdon: or streaming video/audio
[01:27] MooGoo: I want clients using my web app to keep their own ips
[01:27] hdon: or a lot of things i guess
[01:27] MooGoo: and not share mine
[01:28] hdon: but
[01:28] hdon: with TCP you do have push-back
[01:28] hdon: Node makes it very easy to not try to send data to a client that is bandwidth limited
[01:29] sechrist: games still have event sequencers, but yeah some of the messages are dropped
[01:29] sechrist: the quake3 netcode was a really good read
[01:29] sechrist: I guess I just never see myself actually playing a game in a browser

[02:21] joshkehn: Carefully
[02:21] joshkehn: webjay: Can you clarify your question a bit?
[02:22] webjay: Here my selector: { 'Services._id': 4e8176bb75b9634310000000 }
[02:22] joshkehn: You need to wrap that in an ObjectID call
[02:23] webjay: Which I guess should be { 'Services._id': ObjectID('4e8176bb75b9634310000000') }
[02:23] joshkehn: Yes
[02:23] webjay: yes, but how?
[02:23] joshkehn: https://github.com/christkv/node-mongodb-native/blob/master/lib/mongodb/bson/objectid.js
[02:23] joshkehn: Using that
[02:23] joshkehn: You need to require() that file
[02:23] joshkehn: I have a line like:
[02:23] joshkehn: ObjectID = require('../../node_modules/mongodb/lib/mongodb/bson/objectid.js').ObjectID;
[02:24] webjay: I still get selector: { 'Services._id': 4e8176bb75b9634310000000 }
[02:24] joshkehn: Are you just console.log'ing that?
[02:25] joshkehn: Notice https://github.com/christkv/node-mongodb-native/blob/master/lib/mongodb/bson/objectid.js#L91

[02:25] webjay: ooops, sorry
[02:25] joshkehn: What's wrong with that?
[02:26] webjay: I get no results, as it doesn't use ObjectID
[02:26] joshkehn: ...

[02:31] joshkehn: ?
[02:31] webjay: yes
[02:31] webjay: 'Services._id': ObjectID('4e8176bb75b9634310000000')
[02:31] joshkehn: It's suppose to look like that
[02:31] joshkehn: Right
[02:31] webjay: should find a doc right?
[02:31] joshkehn: ObjectID objects have a .toString method that returns 4e8176bb75b9634310000000
[02:31] webjay: I can seee that id in the db
[02:31] joshkehn: Should
[02:31] joshkehn: db.table.find({}, {_id : 1})
[02:32] joshkehn: Have you tried issuing this command directly on the db?
[02:32] webjay: yes, it works: db.users.find({"Services._id": ObjectId("4e8176bb75b9634310000000")});

[02:51] ale_: I have that when a user draws, with socket.io is sent to the other side, but how can I save it?
[02:51] ale_: so that afterwards is accessible
[02:51] sechrist: ooooooh gotcha
[02:51] sechrist: okay, well you have to come up with a way to serialize the drawings
[02:51] sechrist: so that you can save
[02:51] ale_: I was thinking of an array, but it will collapse
[02:52] joshkehn: Collapse?
[02:52] ale_: yes, 10⁹⁹ drawings will collapse the whole server
[02:52] sechrist: I'm sure your app will blow up on hacker news bro
[02:52] joshkehn: Yeah, I see what you mean. You can only stack bits that high before it crumbles. 
[02:52] sechrist: spawn a bunch of ec2 instances
[02:52] sechrist: you know, you cloud
[02:53] sechrist: cloud everything
[02:53] ale_: where?
[02:53] ale_: sechrist: what do you mean with that of hacker news?
[02:53] joshkehn: Do you know how large 10^99 really is?
[02:53] sechrist: ale_: you expire them
[02:53] TheJH: ale_, 10^99? how cool. how many drawings are that per second in the life of every human?

[03:19] PuffTheMagic: how do i force node to use ascii
[03:19] PuffTheMagic: > '\x1b'
[03:19] PuffTheMagic: '\u001b'
[03:20] PuffTheMagic: i need this to be non utf8
[03:20] TheJH: PuffTheMagic, you're using wron terminology, I think
[03:20] TheJH: PuffTheMagic, you want console.log() or so
[03:20] massivebiz has joined the channel
[03:21] TheJH: PuffTheMagic, that escaping stuff is just the pretty-printing function of the console
[03:21] PuffTheMagic: im trying to write an escape sequence to a pty using the node tty module
[03:21] Aria: '\u001b' isn't UTF-8, it's a unicode code point escaped as hexidecimal.
[03:22] PuffTheMagic: and when i write '\033[?1;2c' its written as unicode
[03:22] PuffTheMagic: and the command is not interpreted properly
[03:22] PuffTheMagic: i've tried using using encoding='ascii'
[03:22] PuffTheMagic: and that does not seem to help
[03:22] Aria: What bytes does it output?
[03:26] hermanju_ has joined the channel
[03:26] ryah: PuffTheMagic: try process.stdout.write()
[03:26] ryah: PuffTheMagic: also - you need to make the TTY in raw mode if you're going to do something strange
[03:26] ryah: process.stdout.setRawMode(true)   (in Node v0.5)
[03:27] PuffTheMagic: this is 0.4.12
[03:28] Aria: console.log("\x1b[4AHI\x1b[3mHI") .. those sorts of things work for me in 0.4.x
[03:28] brannig_an has joined the channel
[03:28] PuffTheMagic: i cant enable raw mode
[03:28] jetienne: Aria: nice
[03:28] PuffTheMagic: i get a ENOTTY error
[03:28] Aria: Well maybe that's the problem. You're not on a TTY ;-)
[03:29] PuffTheMagic: well how do I get on a tty if node isnt launched from cli
[03:29] Aria: That depends .. what are you writing to?
[03:30] PuffTheMagic: well i used the tty module to run 'login -f root'
[03:30] PuffTheMagic: so i have some sort of pty
[03:30] PuffTheMagic: cause i do get a shell prompt
[03:30] PuffTheMagic: and it behaves sorta as expected
[03:30] PuffTheMagic: i just cant send Ctrl+C
[03:30] PuffTheMagic: or other escape commands properly
[03:30] PuffTheMagic: well, certain escape commands
[03:31] jimt has joined the channel
[03:34] PuffTheMagic: Aria, i can do cursor movement and graphics mode stuff but I cant do deviceAttribute response
[03:34] PuffTheMagic: or report cursor position
[03:34] PuffTheMagic: or device status report
[03:34] Aria: Is there a device to answer?
[03:35] Aria: a pty is just the TTY API, but there's no actual terminal on the other end. It emulates a terminal LINE, not a terminal.
[03:35] PuffTheMagic: well im making a terminal application, so my term app is there to answer
[03:36] Aria: So what part isn't getting the deviceAttribute command?
[03:36] PuffTheMagic: well im testing my app with vttest
[03:37] simoon has joined the channel
[03:37] Aria: I don't know what that means in this context.
[03:37] Spion_ has joined the channel
[03:37] PuffTheMagic: vttest is an app that tests for vt100 vt220 xterm etc compliance
[03:37] Aria: Your app is emulating a terminal or is driving one?
[03:38] PuffTheMagic: its a console app like gnome-terminal
[03:38] PuffTheMagic: except its for the webos platform and im trying to use node
[03:38] Aria: A terminal emulator, then?
[03:38] skiz has joined the channel
[03:38] PuffTheMagic: ya
[03:38] Aria: ("a console app" usually means "an app that runs on a [sic] console")
[03:38] PuffTheMagic: you are right sorry
[03:38] Aria: So what part isn't getting the deviceAttribute command?
[03:39] PuffTheMagic: well my term emu is getting the deviceAttribute request fine, but when i send the reply
[03:40] PuffTheMagic: vttest gets the '\x1b'
[03:40] PuffTheMagic: and then it comes back with some error
[03:40] PuffTheMagic: the rest of chars i send follow
[03:40] PuffTheMagic: but it does not seem like they arrive as a single ascii string
[03:42] Aria: ... you get an error?
[03:43] Aria: That might be helpful ;-)
[03:43] merlin83 has joined the channel
[03:43] googol has joined the channel
[03:43] PuffTheMagic: the error is just that it didnt get the expected reply
[03:45] Aria: Ah.
[03:45] Aria: What did it get?
[03:45] Aria: (Sad: tty.setRawMode only operates on stdin, not on an arbitrary fd)
[03:46] PuffTheMagic: well it says it just gets  the \x1b
[03:46] PuffTheMagic: but i know the rest of the chars get though
[03:46] Aria: Okay, so you're going to have to write a more specific tool that says what it did get.
[03:46] Aria: Since it doesn't tell you.
[03:47] PuffTheMagic: ok well there is another test that tests newline mode
[03:48] PuffTheMagic: so when newline mode is enable when you press return the term is supposed to send '\r\n'
[03:48] PuffTheMagic: and when its off it just sends '\r'
[03:49] PuffTheMagic: so in this part of the test it first enables newline mode
[03:49] PuffTheMagic: i press return
[03:49] massivebiz has joined the channel
[03:49] PuffTheMagic: and the vterm sends '\r\n'
[03:49] Aria: what's a vterm?
[03:49] PuffTheMagic: sorry my virtual term emu app
[03:49] PuffTheMagic: what ever youw ant to call it
[03:49] shipit has joined the channel
[03:49] PuffTheMagic: i send the reply
[03:49] PuffTheMagic: vttest then says what it got
[03:50] Aria: Okay...
[03:50] PuffTheMagic: but it reports that it only gets the '\r'
[03:50] PuffTheMagic: but then it processes the '\n'
[03:50] PuffTheMagic: and it skips to the next test
[03:50] simoon has left the channel
[03:50] PuffTheMagic: so i know all the bytes are getting though
[03:50] PuffTheMagic: but it seems like there is something between the \r and \n
[03:50] Aria: Interesting.
[03:50] PuffTheMagic: like a \00
[03:51] Aria: Doubtful.
[03:51] PuffTheMagic: well its not treating it as a continuous sequence
[03:51] Aria: I'd use strace if you can to see the exact sequence of system calls it's making
[03:52] paul0 has joined the channel

[03:53] Aria: How good is this vttest tool?

[03:53] Aria: That too.
[03:54] Aria: (or | od -x )
[03:54] PuffTheMagic: Aria, its the most complete tool i've come across for testing a term emu
[03:54] PuffTheMagic: it works on other apps like xterm, konsole, gnome-terminal etc
[03:54] Aria: I didn't ask if it was complete. I asked if it was good ;-)
[03:54] aah has joined the channel
[03:54] Aria: Assumptions it makes, things like that.
[03:55] PuffTheMagic: im pretty sure its valid
[03:55] PuffTheMagic: no other apps have issues passing its test
[03:55] PuffTheMagic: tests
[03:55] PuffTheMagic: at least not the standard vt100/102 tests
[03:55] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[03:56] Aria: So time to look and see what your code really sends.
[03:56] PuffTheMagic: i know what im passing to the stream write function
[03:56] PuffTheMagic: i dont know what node is doing with it after that
[03:56] meso has joined the channel
[03:56] Aria: So check!
[03:56] Aria: You have the tools to do this!
[03:57] Aria: Using strace on a little thing I just wrote, I get things like write(1, "\33[?6c\n", 6
[03:57] Aria: Or $ node t.js  | od -x
[03:57] Aria: 0000000 5b1b 363f 0a63
[03:59] stagas has joined the channel
[03:59] Aria: And on that note, I'm off to bed.
[03:59] PuffTheMagic: write(54, "\33[?1;2c", 7)
[03:59] Aria: So looks like you're sending something good, there.
[03:59] PuffTheMagic: night..
[04:00] PuffTheMagic: so it must be lack of raw mode
[04:00] Aria: raw shouldn't be needed for that.
[04:01] Aria: (ptys start in raw mode, as far as I know, too -- but raw has more to do with handling control characters, not escape sequences)
[04:01] Aria: (control-C and control-\ as job control, etc, not escapes, which are just regular bytes.)
[04:01] PuffTheMagic: well \033 is ctrl+esc
[04:01] ryah: PuffTheMagic: what's this code spposed to do?
[04:01] PuffTheMagic: or ctrl+[
[04:02] PuffTheMagic: ryah, im trying to make a term emulator for hp webos
[04:02] PuffTheMagic: using node as a backend for it
[04:02] ryah: PuffTheMagic: what's the frontend?
[04:02] PuffTheMagic: an app im writing
[04:03] ryah: you're using require('tty').open ?
[04:03] SubStack: fancy
[04:03] PuffTheMagic: ya
[04:04] PuffTheMagic: the frontend is html5 canvas basically
[04:04] ryah: PuffTheMagic: and what's the problem?
[04:05] ryah: PuffTheMagic: does this help you https://gist.github.com/e3128d5fe8923e177ddb
[04:05] PuffTheMagic: ryah, some escape sequence dont get processes properly
[04:06] PuffTheMagic: ryah, nope
[04:06] PuffTheMagic: i have all that
[04:06] PuffTheMagic: i can get a shell
[04:06] PuffTheMagic: although it has no controlling tty
[04:06] PuffTheMagic: and i can process incoming escape sequnces fine
[04:07] PuffTheMagic: but sequences I send as replies dont seem to work properly
[04:07] ryah: PuffTheMagic: how do you send data to the TTY?
[04:08] PuffTheMagic: i write to the stream object created by tty.open
[04:09] ryah: that should work - did you try to strace it?
[04:09] PuffTheMagic: ya
[04:09] ryah: *shrug* wfm
[04:10] PuffTheMagic: i wonder if its cause i dont have a controlling tty
[04:10] PuffTheMagic: i need to figure out how to fix that

[04:18] chovy: i have an idea, curious if this would be possible with nodejs...but create a shared web app that allows screen sharing.
[04:19] chovy: it would be for coders, so if it's just a window that shows me someone's shell prompt as they are typing, that is fine.
[04:20] PuffTheMagic: like screen?
[04:20] chovy: yes, like screen, but allowing two people to view the same session (or more than two).
[04:21] chovy: does screen already do that?
[04:21] PuffTheMagic: i think so
[04:21] sh1mmer has joined the channel
[04:22] chovy: yeah
[04:22] chovy: according to it's wikipage: Screen allows multiple computers to connect to the same session at once, allowing collaboration between multiple users.
[04:23] ag4ve has joined the channel
[04:23] ppcano has joined the channel
[04:23] chovy: so then i'm wondering if I can make my nodejs app connect to a screen session, and post updates back to the browser.
[04:25] SubStack: chovy: you could just stream the terminal contents to the browser
[04:26] SubStack: and send a screen -x name to the terminal
[04:26] SubStack: then you can write/find an ansi->html renderer

[08:47] SanbarComputing: SubStack:  Here is my real question (that was a lead in question for clarification).  The documentation states that both client and server need a private key.  However, when I use a browser, I do not ever explicitly obtain a private key for my browser (client).  I assum https uses TLS (SSL) as its underlying transport.  Does thi mean the browser automatically obtains a private key for itself programmatically, in which case I could do t

[09:01] SanbarComputing: Daegalus:  This answered my question. The client receives the server's public key, encrypts a random number with it, then sends it back to the server which unencrypts the random number with its private key.  The reandom number becomes the shared private key, now known only to the client and server, and they use it to create key material for encryption and decryption:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security
[09:03] mAritz has joined the channel
[09:04] Wizek has joined the channel
[09:05] SanbarComputing: Daegalus: I see now that Node would be an excellent means of privatizing peer-to-peer sessions through it (the server), for instance, for a private chat session amongst peers.  Once the encrypted pip is established, clients could send send simple user/password info to authenticate to each other via the chat app (as an example) to ensure privacy, without exposing these because they are over TLS
[09:06] Daegalus: Sounds about right
[09:07] SanbarComputing: Daegalus:  Thanks - I have never done this before, just learning about it right now for my prototype.  Does Node provide a means of authenticating to the hosting server's user accounts?
[09:07] davidban_ has joined the channel
[09:07] SanbarComputing: Daegalus:  That would be even better, maybe.
[09:07] Daegalus: What do you mean?
[09:07] dexter_e has joined the channel
[09:09] SanbarComputing: Node runs on, say, RHEL.  In order to chat, a user must have an RHEL user account on the host server.  Then, if it is available, I use a Node API to authenticate users to the app using the host server user account information.
[09:09] Daegalus: ummmm, you might have to implement that yourself, maybe calling system processes
[09:09] Daegalus: you can run commands on the system from Node
[09:10] SanbarComputing: Oh, Ok - I am remember now from my Unix admin days RADIUS and KERBEROS???
[09:11] SanbarComputing: Maybe I could use Node to access those services through APIs they expose, maybe through a custom C++ module added into Node ...???

[09:14] Daegalus: yup
[09:14] Daegalus: sounds about right
[09:14] Daegalus: i think linux has commands for that
[09:14] Daegalus: too
[09:14] Daegalus: but i am not 100% sure
[09:14] Daegalus: either way, its extendable and you can build on top o fit
[09:15] SanbarComputing: yes, as I read the API docs on Node, I am very impressed - seems like I have hit upon just what I needed with it.  I am very happy now, and feel confident I can now do the prototype for my client fairly easily on a linode VM machine on the web live.
[09:15] Daegalus: yup

[09:18] SanbarComputing: Well, anyway, it is worth it - I seem to have hit upon the right solution, and can report good things to my client now, I believe.
[09:18] Daegalus: Well try it out first, make sure you use the right thing
[09:18] SanbarComputing: (of course, after testing and stuff this weekend :) )
[09:19] Daegalus: if it doesnt work out, check out Python

[09:24] m4rcs has joined the channel
[09:24] Syndrom1: Like write it now with 0.5.8 and upgrade node without touching the code.
[09:27] Daegalus: Syndrom1: umm, i think most of whats in 0.5.8 goes into the next stable branch of 0.6 . Versioning owrks wehre even numbers are stable builds, odd are unstable might break on something builds
[09:27] Daegalus: whiel yes it should be goof for anything after 0.5.8, it wont work with 0.4 i think
[09:28] Daegalus: so its a "kinda yes"

[09:28] Daegalus: as in once 0.6 comes out, it will continue to support whats in 0.5.8

[09:33] Syndrom1: maybe it is possible to do it without mysql and only use node?
[09:34] Daegalus: thats what the demo does i think
[09:34] Daegalus: or you can use SQLite or Mongo, or any other data store

[09:35] Syndrom1: I don't log that chat, so maybe i can just use arrays
[09:35] Daegalus: you can just purge the log
[09:35] Daegalus: or only keep X amount of lines

[13:27] TheJH: Acolyte, require.paths.unshift is deprecated
[13:28] TheJH: Acolyte, from the 0.4.11 docs: **Note:** Please Avoid Using `require.paths` - require.paths will only be supported through the end of the v0.4 stable branch. It is removed from node as of v0.5. While it seemed like a good idea at the time, and enabled a lot of useful experimentation, in practice a mutable require.paths list is often a troublesome source of confusion and headaches.

[17:24] MOTOWN_DETROIT: So, let's talk about threads in node.js.
[17:24] lz: oh you poor soul
[17:24] guidocalvano: if I use requirejs, are dependency objects cached?
[17:25] guidocalvano: I don't think you can have threads in node dude
[17:25] lz: you can have fibers
[17:25] lz: https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers
[17:25] MOTOWN_DETROIT: I need threads to resize images in node.js
[17:26] hitana has joined the channel
[17:26] Syndrom1: why not use external program for resize?
[17:26] guidocalvano: you probably don't need threads
[17:26] MOTOWN_DETROIT: Resize a 272MB bitmap file of Madonna's hairzone == fail in node.js
[17:26] tjholowaychuk: or just talk to M node workers processes via IPC
[17:26] tjholowaychuk: you dont need to do that on the fly
[17:26] lz: yes, node imagemagick could do a good job
[17:27] FIQ has joined the channel
[17:27] MOTOWN_DETROIT: No, the resizer is written in JS
[17:27] guidocalvano: you can probably split up the resizing task into several smaller tasks
[17:27] FMJaggy has joined the channel
[17:27] tjholowaychuk: unless your service is realtime-ish image manip
[17:27] tjholowaychuk: that's bad design
[17:27] guidocalvano: and then use setinterval to execute those tasks
[17:28] MOTOWN_DETROIT: guidocalvano: setInterval will allow them to run without blocking the event loop?
[17:28] guidocalvano: yes
[17:28] MOTOWN_DETROIT: So it's a thread?
[17:28] guidocalvano: well and no
[17:28] tjholowaychuk: why are you processing images in a web server process
[17:28] guidocalvano: what you can do is do parts of the resizing 
[17:28] guidocalvano: ehm
[17:29] MOTOWN_DETROIT: tjholowaychuk: Because I ambored with Fibonacci numbers.
[17:29] tjholowaychuk: we have video related jobs that take 10m+ but there's no way we could inline that code
[17:29] hitana has joined the channel
[17:30] MOTOWN_DETROIT: Seriously, v8 is really fast for converting the .bmp files into HTML
[17:30] guidocalvano: suppose you can resize a part of the image, using a function resize( sourceImage, top, left, width, height, scale ) 
[17:30] guidocalvano: then you could split the whole image in to pieces
[17:30] MOTOWN_DETROIT: (Don't ask why we're rendering tables from .bmp pixels)
[17:30] guidocalvano: and then resize all those pieces
[17:30] tjholowaychuk: even if you *can* do it in the same process, doesn't mean you should
[17:30] guidocalvano: and recombine those pieces in hte lst call
[17:31] MOTOWN_DETROIT: guidocalvano: Sounds inefficient switching back and forth :/
[17:31] guidocalvano: well you don't do a context switch
[17:31] guidocalvano: its still all in the same thread
[17:31] MOTOWN_DETROIT: Ah
[17:32] MOTOWN_DETROIT: And it will be fast because of v8 if I get the switching back and forth right
[17:32] FireCat has joined the channel

[18:28] errordeveloper has joined the channel
[18:29] guidocalvano: the core of the matter is this: node's event loop has to be interrupted when your thread completes
[18:29] guidocalvano: somehow your thread and the event loop must merge again
[18:30] guidocalvano: figure out how to do that, or don't use threads, but break stuff up into to chunks so you can use setInterval
[18:30] MOTOWN_DETROIT: guidocalvano: Shared memory object and a semaphore some other IPC to tell the event loop to go get the bitbucket?
[18:31] hitana has joined the channel
[18:31] MOTOWN_DETROIT: Or do polling
[18:31] guidocalvano: polling is an option I think
[18:32] guidocalvano: if you have semaphore that you can ask if it is still locked or not
[18:32] guidocalvano: but it sounds ugly
[18:32] guidocalvano: you should have look at some comment I saw drifting by
[18:32] guidocalvano: someone in this thread remarked about using fibers

[18:32] guidocalvano: fibers are like threads
[18:33] MooGoo has joined the channel
[18:33] DJBouche has joined the channel
[18:33] guidocalvano: but rather than have the os decide on switching between threads, you can yield execution to another thread (or in this case fiber) yourself
[18:34] MOTOWN_DETROIT: This is the project? https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers
[18:34] guidocalvano: in any case, it is quite likely that you will have to dive into the code of your library
[18:34] hitana has joined the channel
[18:34] MOTOWN_DETROIT: yeah
[18:34] guidocalvano: but if you do that then you might as well use setInterval

[18:59] arcanis: "global - if you don't have a good reason, and i mean, damn good, don't attach a property to global" ?
[18:59] arcanis: have you got an exemple of a good reason ?

[19:04] `3rdEden: so it's actually 4
[19:04] Lingerance: this == exports
[19:04] Lingerance: So it's actually still 3.

[19:08] joe-f3: Whenever I leave my node server up for more than 2 days with 1k concurrent connections I get the "(node) Hit max file limit. Increase "ulimit - n"".. however my ulimit -n is 200k, it's as if node isn't closing file descriptors.. how can I debug this?
[19:09] guidocalvano: arcanis: someone else made something global and you are forced to use that library?
[19:10] chjj: joe-f3: maybe youre just really popular
[19:10] arcanis: guidocalvano, I'm doing this :>
[19:10] arcanis: I'm writing an application as a library
[19:10] joe-f3: when is a file descriptor open?
[19:10] chjj: when you open it
[19:10] arcanis: and I would like to share large parts of the code
[19:10] joe-f3: the connection?
[19:10] guidocalvano: cocoa does it too
[19:10] Lingerance: Yes
[19:10] guidocalvano: cocoa has to DIE!
[19:10] chjj: a socket is a file descriptor yeah
[19:10] arcanis: (it's for a game, so data structures are the same in the client and the server)
[19:11] joe-f3: is there any way to view the # of file descriptors node has open? 
[19:11] xy_ has joined the channel
[19:11] joe-f3: it must basically not be ever closing any connections then..
[19:11] guidocalvano: arcanis: but this means that you can associate your 'global' info to the server
[19:11] jmar777 has joined the channel
[19:11] guidocalvano: arcanis: are you building a game on top of node? cause so am I
[19:11] arcanis: guidocalvano, sorry ? I don't understand
[19:11] arcanis: yes
[19:11] kadiks: hi, is different formatting can deceive the .replace() ?
[19:11] arcanis: a minecraft-like
[19:12] arcanis: nodes / chunk / world data structure are shared between my server and client codes
[19:12] guidocalvano: arcanis: if you want to have some state for your game, and you want to send messages to that state, you may be tempted to create some global object as the root of you world
[19:12] Dulak: arcanis: you make a module, and place it wherever you like.  you require() the module wherever you need to use it.  You reuse it anywhere you like using require.  You don't have to clutter your global scope to reuse code.
[19:13] jbpros has joined the channel
[19:13] guidocalvano: arcanis: but you can connect this 'global' world to the server
[19:13] guidocalvano: if the server knows where to start delivery everything is fine
[19:13] hermanju_ has joined the channel
[19:13] guidocalvano: I have no global vars in my game
[19:14] kadiks: I mean "encoding", not "formatting"
[19:16] Lingerance: arcanis: If you wrap your stuff like: (function(x) { ... })((require) ? exports : someGlobalTheBrowserHas) you'll be able to share your files with both node and the browser.  Just attach your stuff to x (or whatever you name that param)
[19:17] Lingerance: That messes up if you have something named require on the global scope of the browser though.

[19:26] coreb: I'm experiencing difficulties with socket.io connections from my windows host to my linux virtual pc (I tried fedora with virtualbox and ubuntu with vmware). Locally (inside the vpcs), the application is working as expected, but from the outside the client tries the websocket transport, then xhr, then jsonp, and the server's debug logging confirms that something is happening, but nothing seems to get transfered over the wire. The port is open
[19:26] Lingerance: "The port is open" <-- cut
[19:26] mbrevoort has joined the channel
[19:27] coreb: what's that?
[19:27] Lingerance: The last of your message, it looks like it got cut off.
[19:28] guidocalvano: arcanis: I heard of this thing called browserify
[19:28] guidocalvano: arcanis: I prefer requirejs though
[19:28] coreb: ah, no, just forgot the period
[19:29] Lingerance: I'm thinking it's probably a network (most likely forwarding or routing) issue.
[19:30] coreb: yeah, somehow the connection gets prematurely closed, I guess
[19:30] Lingerance: Are there any other services that work?
[19:30] coreb: normal http requests work fine, both with node and nginx, and ssh's no problem

[20:10] Aria: "nothing" ?
[20:10] Aria: That should log something ...
[20:10] kadiks: it does, is there a function to check the encoding of a string ?
[20:10] Aria: No. Strings are utf-8.
[20:10] Aria: Well, unicode wchars, actually
[20:11] Aria: Entirely abstract and ~universal. You don't get any choice in the representation.
[20:11] Aria: Javascript treats them as arrays of wchars.
[20:12] kadiks: so how do you explain that the console.log return exactly the same string as before ?

[21:26] tjholowaychuk: that would be nice

[21:46] kernelpa`: yeah
[21:47] kernelpa`: I should just start learning them
[21:47] kernelpa`: since this could be one of those opportunities to know the library as it grows

[21:47] kernelpa`: but I just want to make stuff happen fluidly
[21:48] kernelpa`: but I shouldn't be making everyone read this

[22:00] cognominal has joined the channel

[22:04] Aria: Not the most wonderful fit for node, looks like.
[22:04] guidocalvano: I do NOT want this lib depending on requirejs
[22:04] jhurliman has joined the channel
[22:04] Aria: Why not export functions?
[22:04] guidocalvano: all the others I don't mind
[22:04] Aria: I'm not sure what requirejs is getting you
[22:05] xerox: maybe you could look into ender.js
[22:05] guidocalvano: it complains that exports isn't defined
[22:05] Aria: Which it?
[22:06] guidocalvano: but I require other files that use exports and it isn't a problem
[22:06] guidocalvano: though that may be because they are installed by npm
[22:06] Aria: exports is provided by node
[22:07] guidocalvano: yes, but I load one of my js files without any issues
[22:07] guidocalvano: and the file I am trying to load, but won't, loaded perfectly fine before I used require
[22:07] Aria: What js files?

[22:11] Aria: Wow. That's ... strange.
[22:12] guidocalvano: I know I am doing some unconventional stuff
[22:12] guidocalvano: but I was forced to do it that way due to some libs that wouldn't work well together
[22:12] joshgillies has joined the channel
[22:12] Aria: why?!
[22:12] Aria: That's a bizarre pattern. What is exports even supposed to be inside that init function?
[22:13] Lingerance: exports.init = function( exports ) { // change this to: (function(exports) {
[22:13] Lingerance: change the last line from "}" to "})(exports)"
[22:13] swair__ has joined the channel
[22:13] guidocalvano: exports declared as an argument will override the global var
[22:13] Aria: It's like you tried to re-invent require
[22:13] Aria: Right...
[22:13] guidocalvano: and I hacked node
[22:13] Lingerance: Note: you can do a conditional on the last line like: (require) ? exports : someVarForBrowsers
[22:13] guidocalvano: because I was wrapping ogre3D in javascript
[22:14] guidocalvano: and on mac ogre3d makes use of cocoa
[22:14] Aria: And?
[22:14] guidocalvano: and cocoa has a static var [nsapp]
[22:14] guidocalvano: and that var you can't access from a dynamic library
[22:15] guidocalvano: So I tried to hack node to expose NSApp to the dylib, but the version of node's waf, the build system, won't compile objective C
[22:15] Aria: It can be made to. The build system sucks but it can be hacked.
[22:15] guidocalvano: perhaps it can
[22:15] guidocalvano: but I won't 
[22:15] guidocalvano: this works
[22:16] guidocalvano: I'll try renaming that exports var
[22:16] guidocalvano: the arg to init
[22:17] Aria: Why does it need to be wrapped in a function?
[22:17] Aria: I'm not getting what that solves.
[22:17] Aria: What calls this init?

[22:20] paulwe has joined the channel
[22:20] guidocalvano: the node startup process is rather complex, and this works
[22:21] Aria: Heh. It's not that complex... start a script, load things as they're required...

[22:22] swair has joined the channel
[22:22] Aria: Ah. Okay.
[22:23] Aria: Why are you having to pass them in? They're globals...
[22:23] guidocalvano: they contain my glued objects
[22:23] Aria: Seems like you're going through hoops...
[22:23] guidocalvano: I might not have to do that
[22:23] smathy has joined the channel
[22:23] Aria: I think you're treating required code as somehow special. It's not.

[22:32] fbartho: Hey ryah, this is only my second day in the nodejs chatroom, so please forgive if this has been hashed out before, but why the space indent instead of tabs?
[22:33] Aria: Heh. Isn't that a religious argument in almost any programmer culture?
[22:33] Aria: "Because we picked one" is the usual answer...
[22:33] joshkehn: Mixing spaces and tabs can lead to weird formatting.
[22:34] Aria: Now THAT is true. That always pathological. (thanks, Emacs...)
[22:34] fbartho: point to you aria, but I thought most of the civilized world had settled on tab = logical indent, use your editor to make it look to your preferred syntactical styling.
[22:34] Aria: Nah. Not at all.
[22:34] joshkehn: No way.
[22:34] fbartho: We do agree that mixing tabs and spaces is dangerous.
[22:34] Aria: It's about 50/50 in my experience.
[22:34] TheJH: fbartho, that way, you don't have to toogle how many spaces a tab is when you switch between java and js or so :D
[22:34] tjholowaychuk: fbartho i agree with you there
[22:34] tjholowaychuk: but ultimately
[22:34] tjholowaychuk: who cares
[22:34] swair__ has joined the channel
[22:35] Aria: (I'm a tabber, too. It's taking a lot to get used to spaces at work.)
[22:35] TheJH: ACTION spacer
[22:35] tjholowaychuk: plus if you're printing invisibles \t all over
[22:35] tjholowaychuk: is ugly
[22:35] AvianFlu: ACTION uses 2 spaces.
[22:35] fbartho: If I'm making a module I'd like to later release to the nodejs community, how guilty should I feel about using tabs in my own code?
[22:35] joshkehn: ACTION uses four spaces
[22:35] sdwrage has joined the channel
[22:36] joshkehn: ACTION because four spaces is the right amount of space
[22:36] fbartho: TheJH you should have the languages already set to use the right tab indent anyways...
[22:36] joshkehn: ACTION for var [space]
[22:36] fbartho: but 4 spaces makes no sense...
[22:36] fbartho: :(
[22:36] fbartho: 1 space is too little
[22:36] TheJH: 2 spaces ftw!
[22:36] fbartho: 2 spaces = 1 logical indent level?
[22:36] TheJH: fbartho, yup
[22:36] fbartho: only slightly less nonsensical than 4spaces, still bugs me though
[22:37] joshkehn: I prefer four because it makes the code look cleaner. 
[22:37] fbartho: if you prefer spaces, shouldn't your argument be 1 space? (and have your editor figure it out?)
[22:37] guidocalvano: Aria: everything is working now
[22:37] chuck_daniel has joined the channel
[22:37] TheJH: joshkehn, until you have too many nested callbacks :D

[22:38] fbartho: Noone answered me about how guilty I should feel about using tabs... so... I should not feel guilty.
