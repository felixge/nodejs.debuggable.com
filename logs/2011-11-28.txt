[00:00] benvie: moonpeopletime
[00:00] mmalecki: isaacs: let me try.
[00:00] mmalecki: isaacs: (we can get you ssh access into travis boxes if you want)
[00:00] chilts: benvie: m=modified
[00:00] benvie: ok wait
[00:01] mmalecki: isaacs: what's the sha of npm vendored with node?
[00:01] benvie: so that fits with ctime being creation
[00:01] benvie: which is what I thought
[00:01] chilts: benvie: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stat_(Unix)
[00:01] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[00:01] chilts: c=status change (but what that entails, I'm not sure) :)
[00:01] isaacs: atime = last time the file was accessed in any way, ctime = last time flags were changed (ie, the entry in the filesystem was changed), mtime = last time the content was changed (ie, the data on the disk sector was written to)
[00:01] perezd has joined the channel
[00:01] benvie:  <@isaacs> ctime is "changed time", and it refers to the last time that the data about the file was changed.  (mode, mtime, etc.)
[00:01] benvie: is what is confusing me
[00:02] benvie: oh
[00:02] isaacs: benvie: the thing is, a "file" is actually not "a bunch of bytes on a disk"
[00:02] benvie: flags vs. content
[00:02] benvie: right?
[00:02] chilts: yeah, basically :)
[00:02] benvie: got it! now I know more than I did 5 minutes ago
[00:02] isaacs: a "file" is an entry in a table of some sort, including (among other things) an address to a bunch of disk sectors
[00:02] mmalecki: isaacs: ok, it's a tag, cool
[00:02] isaacs: but, the "file" itself is the entry.  that's what stat gives you.
[00:03] benvie: so there is no such thing as a reliable creation time record generally?
[00:03] ritch has left the channel
[00:03] isaacs: with the dev, ino, blksize, and size, that's how the os knows where to spin the disk to in order to read the contents.
[00:04] isaacs: (or if it's an ssd, i guess it doesn't spin, but that's how it knows where to send the molecules or electrosprites or whatevers)
[00:04] mmalecki: isaacs: sorry, I can't reproduce it here
[00:04] benvie: it's a specific area of memory, yeah
[00:04] benvie: same concept at least
[00:04] benvie: er well no
[00:05] isaacs: when writing files, allegedly you can get a slight speed boost if you try to always write in chunks such that you begin and end on an even multiple of blksize
[00:05] benvie: all three of those are referring to logical so technically it doesn't relate to physical. But I get the idea way better than I did
[00:05] isaacs: benvie: yeah, they're just numbers.  the physical reality is down in the hardware.
[00:05] benvie: well just like
[00:06] benvie: defragging a harddrive is basically aligning physical more closely to logical
[00:06] jocafa has joined the channel
[00:06] benvie: as an example
[00:06] isaacs: i thought defragging a harddrive was a way that windows IT folks got extra pay for doing nothing...
[00:07] benvie: it makes a big difference on HDDs not that they will matter for much longer
[00:07] benvie: and helps kill the life on SSDs
[00:07] mmalecki: isaacs: no, it's what you do on file systems that are misdesigned.
[00:07] bnoordhuis: i should tell you about that time i put a windows admin out of work with a 20 line shell script
[00:07] benvie: haha
[00:07] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: you've automated reboots?
[00:07] benvie: my presumption is that fully 75% of the "tech workers" are replacable with about that amount of automation
[00:08] bnoordhuis: mmalecki: mssql backups :)
[00:08] benvie: and kept employed by ignorance
[00:08] paul____: SubStack: or anyone… in this example (https://github.com/tanepiper/dnode-upload-example/blob/master/server.js) it looks like sub is set to only a single emit, what would happen if another client connects, wouldn't it step on the sub initialization? 
[00:08] isaacs: ACTION is automation that was invented to put an earlier version of isaacs out of work.

[00:08] benvie: it's funny though
[00:08] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: oh, these were certainly needed.
[00:08] isaacs: ACTION is a shell script that writes package managers and says snarky things on twitter
[00:08] benvie: most of the work of that we do is in building things to automate someone else's job, and eventually our own
[00:08] benvie: us as in programmers
[00:09] mmalecki: benvie: that's  why we need bugs
[00:09] benvie: until we make bug fixing programs
[00:09] matin: does any1 know how to render plain html in express rather than jade
[00:09] benvie: that are better than us
[00:09] mmalecki: oh shit.
[00:09] benvie: yeah
[00:10] mmalecki: benvie: wait, I can do that!
[00:10] mmalecki: benvie: close every github issue with "this is a feature" through the API
[00:10] benvie: Terminator 2 and 3 had it wrong. There doesn't need to be a war. We've lost the day AI's are better at accounting

[00:12] bnoordhuis: but i have high hopes of being effectively immortal
[00:12] bnoordhuis: ACTION is a closet transhumanist
[00:12] mmalecki: bnoordhuis: you are immortal.
[00:13] mmalecki: every programmer becomes immortal through their code.
[00:13] benvie: kurtzweil is a fucking idiot when it comes to anything related to biology. It's kind of annoying because his ideas relating to AI and machine learning are spot on, and then he drones about crazy ass and completely unfounded biology immortality rants
[00:13] benvie: when the real meat and actual possible things are ignored
[00:13] dandean has joined the channel
[00:13] bnoordhuis: mmalecki: that's comforting
[00:14] bnoordhuis: but i'd rather become immortal by simply not dying
[00:14] benvie: a stack of silicon in a datacenter can and will do things beyond what we can imagine and it's going to change the world, but it's better press to talk about immortality and completely unrelated sundry

[00:16] jacobolus has joined the channel
[00:17] benvie: I agree totally. From talking to people the biggest turnoff I get though is in his confidence. When they refer to the software engineering feats he predicts I tell them with confidence that there's no question it'll happen. When they refer to the biotech stuff, I said ehhh 20% so doable but not likely. But those crazy ass predictions turn more people off than his probable correct ones turn 
[00:17] benvie: people on
[00:18] paul____: benvie: bnoordhuis: there's a more realistic article about eternal life here, at least it makes sense to me. http://www.members.tripod.com/tathagata2000/teaching_4.htm
[00:18] benvie: and the world is going to vastly change either way so it's just a bit annoying when people cling to the crazier ass things he predicts when even the completelt predictable mundane things will revolutionize everything

[00:19] benvie: cause otherwise that's it
[00:19] paul____: bnoordhuis: i heard the correct definition of the term god is simply consciousness without a body. if you are atheist then do you believe the existence of consciousness? personally i doubt the point of how helpful gods can be (and have been) to humanity but not their existence itself

[00:20] bnoordhuis: benvie: i went to a catholic school but i figured early on that there were holes in the story
[00:20] benvie: consciousness is a manifestation of physical processes that are contained withhin your body. Some of those physical processes still probably are outside of science's current understanding. Most of the psychological, higher level ones, still are. But still likely rooted in a mass of flesh.
[00:21] mmalecki: I'd like to become a consiousness without a body.
[00:21] benvie: I went to sunday school
[00:21] isaacs: bnoordhuis: you should come out of the closet.  "transhumanism" is the more elegant position.

[00:21] isaacs: mmalecki: existence IS limitations.
[00:21] paul____: mmalecki: i don't believe there's any way to change things in yourself and in your consciousness without your consciousness being combined with a body (which is the state of life)… so from this point of view life is a rather precious opportunity 
[00:21] isaacs: mmalecki: things that aren't limited don't exist
[00:21] benvie: In Noah's flood: why didn't the other boats float?
[00:22] mmalecki: isaacs: stupidity exists.

[00:29] rails_noob has joined the channel
[00:29] bnoordhuis: benvie: tell me
[00:30] benvie: well I just mean, facebook and twitter and all that has already demonstrated both the avenues of projecting information from previously unknown sources, and the results of that
[00:30] ekryski has joined the channel
[00:30] benvie: anarchy and chaos and lack of intelligence can produce results as effectively as a super-human guided intelligence
[00:31] benvie: ability to project the idea is more important, regardless of its source
[00:32] bnoordhuis: that's rather abstract, can you give an example?
[00:32] benvie: the whole idea of the singularity is that we, one way or another, produce intelligences that exceed our own. When that happens it becomes exponential because something smarter can then create something smarter still, at a faster rate
[00:32] dandean has joined the channel
[00:32] benvie: but what if you can project influence with no intelligence at all
[00:32] benvie: just echochamber

[04:59] sqpat: hey, I'm trying to pull a json object in node from the buffer argument of stream.on("data")
[04:59] sqpat: it seems like theres occasionally some junk around the json object im passing in, so eval isnt working
[04:59] sqpat: anyone know if that typically happens in buffers like this?
[05:00] AvianFlu: sqpat: are you buffering all the data events or trying to parse after the first one?
[05:00] sqpat: good point its after the first.
[05:00] a_meteorite has joined the channel
[05:00] sqpat: do i have to flush the buffer?
[05:00] AvianFlu: I don't think so
[05:01] AvianFlu: but, you know, some kind of total += buffer is in order
[05:01] AvianFlu: then you parse the buffer
[05:01] AvianFlu: rather, total
[05:01] sqpat: ah. so i might need to keep track of some offset as im reading the buffer and start reading from that position?
[05:01] chrislorenz has joined the channel
[05:02] AvianFlu: if you want/need to use Buffer methods, make a big one for the total and keep track of it, yeah
[05:02] AvianFlu: if you're just messing around, I'd say .toString() them and concat to save thinking time

[06:12] michaelhartau: for example, are there any large-ish production sites running node (or even more specifically, express) that are open source?
[06:12] tbranyen: __proto__ directly sets the prototype, setting .prototype is for constructors to use when creating a new instance

[10:49] robinduckett: SubStack: ping
[10:50] robinduckett: SubStack: are there any examples of how to use "do" in node-seq? I wanted to use a Seq() inside a parEach, not sure about wether to just go ahead and use a new instance or if there was a way to use do...?
[10:52] ShinyDarkness has joined the channel
[10:52] ShinyDarkness has left the channel
[10:52] SubStack: robinduckett: you should probably just do another seq() inside
[10:52] ShinyDarkness has joined the channel
[10:52] SubStack: and call the next function when you're done
[10:53] SubStack: parEach_ gives the next as the first parameter
[10:54] jbrokc_ has joined the channel
[10:54] robinduckett: SubStack: so .parEach_(limit, function(next, result) instead of .parEach(limit, function(result) { var next = this;
[10:54] SubStack: sure
[10:55] robinduckett: okay thanks :)
[10:55] SubStack: then do an inner seq() again in the callback and just call next() when you're done
[10:55] robinduckett: sweet
[10:55] robinduckett: hopefully this should be okay for 40k or so records
[10:55] robinduckett: although only doing 1k at a time
[10:55] robinduckett: to keep it quick
[10:56] SubStack: seq has some problems with the callstack :/
[10:56] mauritslamers_: tanepiper: could you try to confirm the same error on aSync mkdir?
[10:56] SubStack: I got a patch to fix it but haven't merged it yet
[10:56] tanepiper: mauritslamers_: i did
[10:56] robinduckett: SubStack: each control flow lib has it's flaws
[10:56] tanepiper: same error
[10:56] robinduckett: SubStack: I prefer seq's syntax
[10:56] mauritslamers_: tanepiper: yep, here too, I will update the ticket

[10:57] robinduckett: tanepiper: sup my reddit twitter brother

[10:57] SubStack: robinduckett: one thing I would like seq to do is parallelism limits for unbounded recursion
[10:57] tanepiper: oh hey 
[10:57] SubStack: for when you want to do something like a directory traversal
[10:58] SubStack: and you don't know how many directories you're going to parse ahead of time
[10:58] robinduckett: SubStack: That would be nice, I was just thinking it could do with a way to traverse the stack and go back to a previous callback for recursive looping
[10:58] robinduckett: at the moment I'm just calling seq recursively inside it's own function
[10:58] Arthorius has joined the channel
[11:00] robinduckett: which works but isn't as fancy if I could just do a seq('seq1', function() {}).seq(function() {if (blah) this.continue('seq1');})

[13:29] alex_fhg: hi, i'm trying to install npm on windows, following the readme. but the install step fails with: node cli.js install rpm -gf
[13:29] alex_fhg: npm ERR! 404 'rpm' is not in the npm registry.
[13:29] alex_fhg: anybody know what that is abotu?
[13:30] rails_noob: i thought that npm is included in the installer you get off nodejs.org
[13:30] eddyb: rails_noob: there
[13:30] rails_noob: but i also read that there's a problem with npm help
[13:30] eddyb: 's an installer?
[13:30] eddyb: I've only seen an .exe
[13:30] Tobbe: yes, there is
[13:30] Tobbe: .msi
[13:30] alex_fhg: didn't know there is an installer now
[13:30] rails_noob: eddyb: for windows there sure is
[13:31] Tobbe: http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.6.3/node-v0.6.3.msi
[13:31] eddyb: alex_fhg: uhm...
[13:31] eddyb: there's no rpm
[13:31] alex_fhg: nevertheless, does somebody know something about that error?
[13:31] eddyb: rpm means RedHat Package manager
[13:31] alex_fhg: eddyb: thanks
[13:31] r04r has joined the channel
[13:31] eddyb: but....
[13:31] eddyb: it has nothing to do with node
[13:31] alex_fhg: why would it need rpm?
[13:32] eddyb: or npm
[13:32] eddyb: alex_fhg: it doesn't
[13:32] eddyb: rpm is a linux package manager
[13:32] rails_noob: ah, my bad i was thinking npm
[13:32] alex_fhg: i know, but why is it telling me it needs it then ;)
[13:32] eddyb: alex_fhg: where?
[13:32] mauritslamers_: tanepiper: yes I saw the reply... preparing my own atm
[13:32] alex_fhg: node cli.js install rpm -gf (linebreak) npm ERR! 404 'rpm' is not in the npm registry.

[13:35] eddyb: show me that readme

[15:56] stegro: empirically it seems to do what I want
[15:56] stegro: but I know stuff like that is Really Hard(tm)
[15:56] ppcano has joined the channel
[15:57] secoif: as in, you might be leaving processes around doing nothing
[15:57] stegro: and normally best left to people who actually understand it
[15:57] Glenjamin: stegro: it makes sense, but it wont work
[15:57] Glenjamin: the old process doesn't stop listening before the new one starts
[15:57] stegro: Glenjamin: howso?
[15:57] ruxkor: hi everybody! does anybody have experience with building tcp servers/clients for binary data in node? I am currently having a hard time finding resources for this.
[15:57] stegro: Glenjamin: with the new cluster stuff that's fine
[15:58] Glenjamin: it is?
[15:58] stegro: well - if I log the pid of the process that's handling each request, it seems to do the right thing
[15:58] stegro: i.e. the new process takes over, the old one drains its running connections then dies
[15:59] heatxsink: stegro: do you cap the number of workers?
[15:59] Glenjamin: heh, I don't see how they share the port, but thats cool that they do
[15:59] Glenjamin: must be because they have the same FDs
[15:59] stegro: heatxsink: I'm not, but as long as you don't send too many SIGHUPs it's naturally limited
[15:59] stegro: heatxsink: maybe I should add a hard limit, though
[15:59] heatxsink: ya
[16:00] stegro: my actual app is a bit cleverer than that toy example - it also deals with children that die without being asked to terminate
[16:00] heatxsink: might want to cap it a the number of procs depending on the worker you are spawning
[16:00] stegro: (and respawns them)
[16:00] heatxsink: stegro: nice

[17:50] joshsmith: oh okay
[17:50] secoif: tjholowaychuk is describe(signature, function() significant
[17:50] secoif: tjholowaychuk …to the way the tests run or is it just for reporting
[17:51] tjholowaychuk: secoif that defines how the suites/test-cases are nested

[17:51] tjholowaychuk: so yup
[17:51] joshsmith: DirectedEdge is sweet, so I needed some convenience functions for it
[17:51] secoif: tjholowaychuk as in, does it need unique names in the describe() to register as different tests
[17:52] soapyillusions: is the following possible, I have the following dir structure (app/index.html, app/server.js, app/build/index.html) and server.js serves index.html. Now when in prod I would like server.js to serve app/build/index.html as /index.html (and /app/build/assets/* as /assets/*
[17:52] tjholowaychuk: secoif nope, suites of the same name get merged
[17:52] secoif: hrm

[18:11] tjholowaychuk: soapyillusions app.use with '/build'

[18:12] tjholowaychuk: or GET /build/foo/bar.html -> ./foo/bar.html
[18:12] tjholowaychuk: etc
[18:12] tjholowaychuk: also connect.static('/') is probably not what you want :p

[18:13] tjholowaychuk: :p
[18:13] soapyillusions: tjholowaychuk well I have been using connect.static to serve my app code and index and assets (as it's in dev mode) then when it detects NODE_ENV==='prod' it would only serve what's in ./build as the root of the webserver

[20:46] thdbased: Question for you guys. If you were building a pretty big web app would you do all of your coding in javascript + if not what other language would you use to do more complex things?
[20:47] mmalecki: bingomanatee_: I'd call that util.kgb
[20:47] OneOfOne: thdbased: yes i would
[20:47] bingomanatee_: Javascript is capable of conmplexity. 
[20:47] tbranyen: bingomanatee_: tell that to precision math
[20:47] context: what
[20:47] bingomanatee_: all code sucks for floats. 
[20:48] bingomanatee_: Most coding complexity is the repetitive application of the same simple patterns. 
[20:48] context: thdbased: depends on the project.
[20:48] thdbased: So you really woudn't use any other language to do more deep stuff
[20:48] context: only reason something is complex is cause you made it complex.
[20:48] chia has joined the channel
[20:49] bingomanatee_: Its a very fuzzy question - it depends - for instance, there may be tasks that  have good solutions pre-built such as Jenkins/Fab for ssl actions.

[20:51] thdbased: The thing is if you look at huge scale apps like facebook/twitter/etc you almost always have a combinations of languages being used. There must be a reason no?
[20:52] GrizzLyCRO1: thdbased: write everything in your favorite language, and make it modular
[20:52] GrizzLyCRO1: later if some parts need optimization, you can rewrite them in other language

[20:53] brianloveswords has joined the channel
[20:54] thdbased: I am guessing the reason they use different language comes down to speed? Things that need to go fast need fast languages, the rest can use more simple implementations that are easier to handle/update/etc...

[21:24] eeemsi: the newest version in debian was last updated Tue, 27 Sep 2011 16:10:10
[21:24] chjj: eeemsi: you might want to just build it yourself, or grab the precompiled binary

[21:26] chjj: i always just build it myself, its not that tiresome, i say go for it
[21:26] stride: eliasp: I found 0x200000 in some weird header file, it might be the wrong value. couldn't yet figure out why my node compile misses those constants
[21:27] chjj: eeemsi: you can literally do it in a few commands: "git clone ... && cd node && ./configure && make && make install"
[21:27] eliasp: stride: ah, ok... maybe I should look what value O_SYMLINK has in my header files...
[21:27] franciscallo has joined the channel
[21:27] Dulak: eeemsi: node is under heavy development right now, the best thing is to get the source from github, get the source deb from debian unstable, and then use the files from the deb to cut your own up-to-date .deb.  It'll take an hour or two to figure it out, but then you can do it everytime a new stable release comes out in just a few minutes.
[21:28] stride: eliasp: do you know which one it's defined in normally? I found that value in a random apple related header on google :)
[21:28] chjj: eeemsi: should also checkout the last stable tag*
[21:28] eliasp: stride: no idea... thought this might be defined in the glibc headers...
[21:28] Dulak: eeemsi: if you only have 1 or 2 servers to worry about you can skip cutting your own deb and just compile/install directly
[21:28] eliasp: stride: but haven't found a match on my system yet
[21:29] chjj: Dulak: that would be a pain if he doesnt have apt configured to be able to grab unstable debs when hes not on unstable

[21:45] eliasp: bnoordhuis: oh, ok... what to use instead on Linux? ;)
[21:46] eliasp: stride: hmm, doesn't work here ... even the latest graceful-fs from git doesn't have any related changes
[21:46] bnoordhuis: eliasp: what do you need to do?
[21:46] sctb: bnoordhuis: is there any kind of blocking read available from libuv?
[21:46] stride: eliasp: yeah, tried that too
[21:46] bnoordhuis: sctb: no - that kind of flies in the face of what libuv is
[21:47] stride: bnoordhuis: npm uses constants.O_SYMLINK in it's graceful-js lib (also one of isaacs modules), that causes the linking stuff to fail
[21:48] eliasp: bnoordhuis: http://paste.kde.org/152318/ see also: https://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues/1793
[21:48] Dulak: bradleymeck: it doesn't help that I never intended to go into the hosting business, I started just hosting sites for friends and it grew over time to the 42 servers I am running now.  I make more money from the hosting than anything else, but I still discourage new customers, they insist though, and I can't just say 'no I will not take your money to do almost no work after the initial setup'
[21:48] bnoordhuis: yeah, i think isaacs is hastily looking for a workaround right now
[21:48] sctb: bnoordhuis: I get it, but I have this (admittedly rare) problem of absolutely having to perform a blocking read and I'm looking for a way to do it without having to write a Node module

[22:01] bnoordhuis: sctb: doing blocking reads from stdin can work depending on what type of device /dev/stdin is (file, pipe, tty)

[22:12] johnnywengluu: isaacs: have you thought about making npm for browser modules too?
[22:12] johnnywengluu: kinda like http://www.getbpm.org/
[22:13] johnnywengluu: so we don't have to download separate js files and put them in assets manually
[22:13] johnnywengluu: and then having to check if they are the latest manually too
[22:13] isaacs: johnnywengluu: you can use browserify for that.
[22:13] quackquack has joined the channel
[22:13] isaacs: or, apparently, bpm :)
[22:14] johnnywengluu: isaacs: but if npm was making it into a standard I am sure a lot of packages would make it work on both browser and server

[22:15] isaacs: johnnywengluu: i'm not really interested in supporting a browser package manager right now.

[22:16] quackquack: hey tjholowaychuk, im loving Mocha! no longer does testing async code cause my brain to bleed :)  is there a way to make it do CI?
[22:17] tjholowaychuk: hahaha brain bleeding is never fun
[22:17] gkatsev: lol, great topic
[22:17] tjholowaychuk: what do you mean by "do CI" though?
[22:17] tjholowaychuk: it depends on the CI server really
[22:17] quackquack: well, w/ expresso, there was a -w tag for watching, right?
[22:17] tjholowaychuk: some might consume TAP, some might just dump the stdio
[22:18] quackquack: so my best bet would be to set up a separate CI server and use that?
[22:18] tjholowaychuk: my fav approach is cijoe
[22:18] tjholowaychuk: simple exit status
[22:18] quackquack: k, ill look at that!

[23:22] mike5w3c: I'm wondering about https://twitter.com/#!/__DavidFlanagan/status/141208790358953984
[23:22] mike5w3c: "Node 0.6.2 can't use a proxy as a weakmap key http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=1565 Node 0.5.10 uses a newer version of V8 than 0.6.2 does."
[23:22] benvie: yeah
[23:23] benvie: they undid the upgrade to V8 3.7 due to it having some issues
[23:23] mike5w3c: is that true for the current tip as well?
[23:23] mike5w3c: OK
[23:23] benvie: it's the unstable branch
[23:23] mike5w3c: ah
[23:23] benvie: yeah it hasn't been switched to yet
[23:23] mike5w3c: thanks
[23:23] benvie: I compiled node with V8 3.7.9 due to that issue
[23:23] benvie: the proxy as weakmap key
[23:23] mike5w3c: ah, OK
[23:24] ceej has joined the channel
[23:24] mike5w3c: so it does compile at least
[23:24] benvie: oh yeah it works fine and I think the issues may have been fixed already
[23:24] benvie: they changed the garbage collector
[23:24] mike5w3c: I see
[23:24] benvie: and it wasn't as fast or something which is why node downgraded at the time
[23:24] benvie: but there's been a lot of improvement in v8 since then
[23:25] benvie: I'd expect it to come back soon enough
[23:25] CiRlE has joined the channel
[23:25] mike5w3c: cool
[23:26] benvie: the main use for weakmaps involves using proxies for keys so that bug is really annoying

[23:26] _unary has joined the channel
[23:26] benvie: the most recent version of V8 also introduce Set and Map when jusing the --harmony flag
[23:26] benvie: versions
[23:27] mmalecki: is it possible to enable harmony at runtime?
[23:27] benvie: not after V8 starts
[23:27] benvie: you have to launch a new instance with the flag
[23:28] benvie: or if there is a way I don't know of it
