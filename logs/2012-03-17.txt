[00:09] Leemp: For anyone who is familiar with Jade.. Have "partials" been replaced by extends/block/include  ? I was viewing a tutorial on nodetuts.com, and i noticed that the jade documentation doesn't even have a section for partials. Thoughts?

[00:12] sorensen: Leemp: partials are still valid
[00:13] enjalot: Hi all, I'm trying to use the request module to download an image from another service. I can't seem to write the image out as a valid jpg. not sure how to figure out what format its coming in as and how to transform it (if i have to)
[00:13] Leemp: sorensen: So, extends/etc are the replacements? I suppose i was mostly just trying to understand why i didn't see them documented at all.. i thought i was going nuts :s
[00:14] sorensen: they arent replacements per say
[00:14] sorensen: they provide different functionality
[00:14] Leemp: Huh.. but they're not in the documentation at all

[11:56] dmilith: and it gives me: ~ Err: null, ids: gzw1ehplbkfepv56i1qk

[11:57] dmilith: but in next line I have: http://i.verknowsys.com/372h38450p0r3R1p0t1E
[11:57] dmilith: and I would like to use value of that id to be put just like one of that properties in @render

[13:39] Octayn: What is confusing you in particular?
[13:39] TheJH has joined the channel
[13:39] njbair: I guess how node.js relates to less, and by extension, twitter bootstrap
[13:40] Octayn: less just uses node for file io and stuff
[13:40] njbair: i understand that it's running js on the server side just like any other server side interpreter
[13:40] John-Gresham: Bonuspunkt: looks exactly like what I was looking for, thanks a lot :)
[13:41] njbair: honestly I think all of my confusion stems from an utter lack of documentation for bootstrap
[13:41] tokumine has joined the channel
[13:41] njbair: and their IRC channel isn't much help, unless you like nothing but join/part/quit notices

[13:47] CarterL has joined the channel
[13:47] njbair: I've worked through those but I don't understand how to use it with less
[13:47] Octayn: less is just a css preprocessor
[13:48] njbair: I know that you can compile less files. can they also be parsed in real-time by node?
[13:48] lsdafjklsd has joined the channel
[13:48] kbhit has joined the channel
[13:48] Octayn: bootstrap sets some variables and gives you some mixins, but other than that it's plain less
[13:48] nafis has joined the channel
[13:48] Octayn: njbair: parsed in real-time? I don't understand what you mean by that. You can compile them on request, if that's what you mean.
[13:49] nafis has joined the channel
[13:50] HacDan has joined the channel
[13:50] njbair: so the less files sit on the server, less compiles them into css files and serves those to the client?
[13:50] Octayn: less doesn't serve anything
[13:50] Octayn: it's purely a preprocessor
[13:51] njbair: so it compiles css files from the less source, then the webserver serves the css? or do web browsers receive the less files and compile them client-side?
[13:51] Octayn: what I do is process and minify all my css and then deploy that, instead of sending less to the client and having it process client-side or doing it with express.
[13:51] Octayn: njbair: all of those are options
[13:51] njbair: so you can run less in your dev environment and put only the compiled css on the server
[13:52] Octayn: yes
[13:52] njbair: ok that's a huge help to know.
[13:52] njbair: do you use bootstrap?
[13:52] Octayn: no but I know a bit about it
[13:53] njbair: when you download the bootstrap .zip package, it contains no .less files
[13:53] njbair: when you download the source, it contains no .css files
[13:53] Octayn: they compile it for distribution, afaik
[13:54] njbair: so then I guess the distribution .zip package is designed for people who do not wish to modify any of the less

[15:42] SubStack: timoxley: try overwriting stdout's .write?

[15:43] pgte has joined the channel
[15:43] SubStack: and likewise for console if the code is doing console.log()
[15:44] SubStack: or you could execute the lib in a child process and read the stdout directly
[15:44] timoxley: SubStack good ideas. I somehow thought I'd be able to swap out the process.stdout file descriptor with some kind of in-memory stream/buffer thing.
[15:45] Cromulent has joined the channel
[15:45] SubStack: easier to just overwrite the globals
[15:45] AntelopeSalad: SubStack: are you still developing dnode or is there another module that took its place?
[15:46] SubStack: or run in a new context with mock globals
[15:46] SubStack: AntelopeSalad: upnode is a handy lib that sits on top of dnode
[15:46] AntelopeSalad: yeah i just saw your dnode/upnode/fleet video last night
[15:48] SubStack: I like to keep feature creep under control by writing new modules that depend on the old ones to handle features I want
[15:48] AntelopeSalad: i really liked the idea of having a separate process/server for auth , dnode would be the best choice atm to set that up?

[16:17] mc: timoxley: mysql

[16:25] owen1: is it being used for js as well?
[16:26] SubStack: I put docs in the readme

[16:28] bradleyg has joined the channel
[16:28] chadskidmore has joined the channel
[16:29] owen1: SubStack: what about function/module level docs+
[16:29] owen1: ?
[16:29] SubStack: module level docs?
[16:30] SubStack: each module should have its own docs
[16:30] SubStack: seems like a poor separation of concerns to lump too many interfaces into the same project
[16:30] mansoor has joined the channel
[16:30] SubStack: you could also just throw down a separate markdown file for each thing you want to document
[16:31] timoxley: owen1 docs in nodeland are typically: README + usage examples + tests.
[16:32] owen1: timoxley: so no one add a few lines of docs before some complex functions?
[16:32] timoxley: owen1 high cost to benefit ratio vs "document everything" xDoc approach
[16:33] totallymike has joined the channel
[16:34] timoxley: owen1 some people do, there is jsdoc and docco, but you don't see that style of api doc as much
[16:35] owen1: timoxley: that's why i find tomdoc a nice approach. it's not structured rigidly as rdoc/yard etc. it's for other devs to read, and not for generating html (though you can).
[16:35] AndreasMadsen has joined the channel

[16:37] timoxley: owen1 I don't use jslint. have used jshint in the past when working in team though
[16:40] SubStack: owen1: another problem is that most doc generators are shit at giving you a nice way of describing callbacks
[16:40] SubStack: and dynamic arguments based on runtime typechecks
[16:40] owen1: SubStack: yeah, i don't care about generating it.
[16:40] trivol has joined the channel
[16:40] graeme_f has joined the channel
[16:41] sandfox has joined the channel
[16:41] SubStack: I write functions with order-insensitive arguments rather often
[16:41] owen1: just a few lines before a complex function that explain the arguments, return value (or callback) and maybe an exampl
[16:42] SubStack: and you could get a function back from a function call, so you'd need to describe that separately
[16:42] SubStack: doc tools tend to be really big into classical OO patterns
[16:42] SubStack: and fuck those interfaces
[16:42] Aria: It's sad but true.
[16:42] owen1: Aria: what's sad?
[16:42] Aria: That doc generators suck.
[16:43] SubStack: just write some markdown or text
[16:43] SubStack: describing how your code works
[16:43] owen1: SubStack: so node (or js) tend to use non classical oo?
[16:43] SubStack: no need for comment blocks to be picked out by some tooling
[16:43] owen1: SubStack: agree!
[16:43] smorin has joined the channel
[16:44] owen1: i don't care about the tools. i care about me and other devs reading my coed.
[16:44] owen1: code
[16:44] sandfox: use the inline code thing
[16:44] sandfox: i forget its name
[16:44] sandfox: something like jsdoc  (but i could be wrong)
[16:44] owen1: sandfox: let me know if you remember
[16:45] mc: owen1: i wrote a lazy tool to put markdown documentation in code
[16:45] mc: it's in npm as ape
[16:45] sandfox: just looking now  (and it's not jsdoc) but markdown is a solid alternative (esp when used with github)
[16:45] mc: you write your docs in markdown format in the comments, it can generate either markdown or html output
[16:45] mc: it's nothing fancy, but it works
[16:46] Industrial: What do I do with https://gist.github.com/897686efeddd7f85cb0d ?
[16:46] owen1: mc: i use .md for my readmes. but what about before a function?
[16:46] mc: owen1: the idea is you write api documentation in markdown formatted comments in the source code
[16:47] owen1: mc: oh. and github display it nicely as the readme? let me try?
[16:47] RLa: what about docco and other such tools for literate programming?

[16:47] Aria: Industrial: Look  for where slaveOk is called, see what object is being referenced, then track back and see why it's undefined.

[16:51] owen1: mc: from some reason i assumed that github knows to display nice markdown pages only for readme files. i didn't think i can annotate markdown inside a js file
[16:52] mc: it won't parse it, that was the idea behind my tool. it will write a .md file for each supported code file
[16:52] mc: then you click the .md file in github and it will display neatly formatted
[16:53] owen1: mc: but didn't you mention i can use markdown syntax within js file before my functions?

[16:53] mc: https://github.com/nathan-lafreniere/ape/blob/master/lib/ape.md
[16:53] mc: you can get that
[16:53] owen1: sandfox: for someone that wrote markdown, the blog you gave me is really ugly..
[16:54] AntelopeSalad: how can something so useful have so little followers, damn i wish i knew about ape about 24 hours ago
[16:55] sandfox: owen1: Yeah , his personal taste i guess
[16:55] mc: i haven't spent any time trying to spread it around
[16:55] Aria: Because follower count isn't a measure of goodness ;-)
[16:55] mc: it's proven pretty useful for us in the office though
[16:56] mc: and one of my coworkers added a pile of extra supported languages
[16:56] AntelopeSalad: aria: yeah but at a quick glance it usually makes you more comfy when you see a lot of people using that code

[17:01] hipertracker has joined the channel
[17:02] Gatoradecode has joined the channel
[17:02] SubStack: comments have a short shelf-life
[17:02] SubStack: so they tend to persist long after they stop being useful
[17:03] mmalecki: SubStack: no comments aren't useful at all
[17:03] AntelopeSalad: if you tie your comments into your readmes with markdown, then you're forced to keep them up to date
[17:03] Gatoradecode: I need to listen on multiple ports from the same node.js process. Is this feasible, and will it save memory over firing up a separate node for each port? (There are 20 ports)
[17:04] TooTallNate has joined the channel
[17:04] AntelopeSalad: or suffer having an out of date "away from code, this is what devs are reading before they even decide to use your module" documentation
[17:04] Gatoradecode: It looks like node by itself uses about 50mb of memory.
[17:04] SubStack: mmalecki: lack of clutter can be a sort of utility
[17:04] mmalecki: well, I almost always end up reading code
[17:04] SubStack: and comments are pretty much always clutter
[17:04] SubStack: that hurt readability
[17:05] sandfox has joined the channel
[17:05] SubStack: when I read other people's code I don't even look at the comments
[17:05] mc: i typically only look for comments if a piece of code is really unreadable
[17:05] mmalecki: well, actually, neither do I
[17:05] diogogmt has joined the channel
[17:05] sandfox: yeah, comments are a fallback for when people write batshit crazy logic
[17:05] AntelopeSalad: experience probably plays a big role there
[17:05] mmalecki: or what mc said
[17:06] sandfox: they are really helpful for fresh starters generally though
[17:06] Gatoradecode: So any ideas on how much memory node.js by itself uses? I'm worried about having 20 node instances to run on 20 ports.
[17:06] SubStack: Gatoradecode: it's really easy to listen on more than 1 port in a single node process
[17:07] SubStack: this isn't apache or anything silly like that
[17:07] SubStack: you just create some servers and call .listen(port) on them
[17:08] Gatoradecode: SubStack: Okay, what if I want a different process for each server?
[17:08] SubStack: then just spawn up a new one for every server
[17:08] SubStack: easy
[17:08] Gatoradecode: (Or is that a really bad idea with 20 servers?)
[17:08] Gatoradecode: i.e. context switching overhead
[17:08] TooTallNate: Gatoradecode: depends on how busy you expect them to be
[17:09] Gatoradecode: Right now, we're firing up a different node.js for each port. Which is costing a lot in overhead :/
[17:09] sandfox: how many cores do you have to play with?
[17:09] slajax has joined the channel
[17:09] TooTallNate: it's very likely that if these are not very demanding sites (read: mostly static) then you could do all 20 in 1 process no problem
[17:09] SubStack: Gatoradecode: what do you mean by "overhead"?
[17:09] sandfox: node uses roughly 10-20MB from experience per process as starting point...

[17:15] timoxley: newcode ok cool
[17:15] newcode: timoxley: thx!
[17:15] justicefries: owen1: it's hard for me to look at synchronous code now.
[17:15] justicefries: owen1: I'm very used to async and/or functional code.
[17:15] TooTallNate: newcode: that should have installed npm with node
[17:15] sandfox: owen1: I use coffee script alot (yeah haters gone the for that)
[17:15] timoxley: newcode that's the latest. often people get node from their package manager and it's ancient. 
[17:15] TooTallNate: unless you compiled with --without-npm
[17:15] Brandon_R: npmjs.org websites needs an updat
[17:15] Brandon_R: e
[17:15] Brandon_R: it looks 2000
[17:16] newcode: TooTallNate: I don't have npm though
[17:16] justicefries: TooTallNate: I built from source yesterday and npm wasn't installed, I couldn't figure out why.
[17:16] timoxley: Brandon_R I think that's intentional
[17:16] justicefries: but when I built from source about a week ago
[17:16] justicefries: it was there.
[17:16] mmalecki: hash -r
[17:16] TooTallNate: newcode: justicefries: interesting
[17:16] justicefries: yeah
[17:16] justicefries: i was a little confused when I suddenly didn't have npm.
[17:16] owen1: sandfox: i like coffee's syntax, but i think i should learn js first. and later on coffee, just becase it's getting popular as well.
[17:16] mc: newcode: curl npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh
[17:16] TooTallNate: newcode: justicefries: and you guys ran `make install`?
[17:16] justicefries: mmhmm.
[17:17] justicefries: yeah, I rebuild it pretty often.
[17:17] justicefries: doing ops, new computer, etc.
[17:17] newcode: I just did apt-get install nodejs
[17:17] justicefries: oh don't do it with apt.
[17:17] newcode: after following this
[17:17] justicefries: git clone git@github.com:joyent/node && cd node && ./configure && make && sudo make install
[17:17] TooTallNate: newcode: you got lucky this time that they were on the lastet version
[17:17] newcode: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager
[17:17] sandfox: newcode: npm is a separate  module on ubuntu
[17:17] TooTallNate: newcode: but that's probably why you didn't get npm
[17:18] newcode: so you suggest no apt-get?
[17:18] _akshayms has joined the channel
[17:18] TooTallNate: i'm sure isaacs would recommend against using apt-get
[17:18] ohtogo has joined the channel
[17:18] newcode: ok

[17:18] newcode: so where should I do the git clone from?
[17:18] newcode: in ubuntu
[17:18] sandfox: newcode: or use  the chris lea repo for ubuntu
[17:19] newcode: sandfox: that's what i did sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
[17:19] TooTallNate: i just use n
[17:19] infynyxx has joined the channel

[17:20] sandfox: newcode: although the best way is from source if you have the time/skill/etc
[17:20] justicefries: eh, it's a one liner to install from source.
[17:21] newcode: I should be good compiling from source

[17:23] justicefries: it's pretty beastly.
[17:23] justicefries: second tab
[17:23] justicefries: OpenGL ES 2.0 support
[17:23] TooTallNate: justicefries: i meant the pi
[17:23] justicefries: ohh
[17:23] TooTallNate: but that's sweet too
[17:24] TooTallNate: $125; not too bad

[17:25] Brandon_R: assuming same server equiptment and config, which os is node fastest on?
[17:25] justicefries: my expected ship date is april 13.
[17:25] robhawkes has joined the channel
[17:25] justicefries: hh__: because I don't want a phone, I'm using it for home automation and small home-based web servers, as well as our dashboard computer for work.
[17:26] hh__: ah ok
[17:26] justicefries: also I want to experiment with building a student nodekit, that would ship with a small IDE, node.js, and everything to get started developing and using say, a raspberry pi.
[17:27] justicefries: put the SD card in, attach a monitor, and go.
[17:27] timoxley: justicefries that sounds awesome
[17:27] mc: justicefries: i agree, that'd be really awesome
[17:27] mc: i'd buy one
[17:27] mc: or two.. you know, for the kids
[17:27] justicefries: awesome
[17:27] justicefries: yeah
[17:27] mc: not because i'd steal them
[17:27] justicefries: haha.
[17:28] shedinja_ has joined the channel
[17:28] justicefries: I'm debating right now if it's something that should include monitor/HDMI cable/keyboard/mouse, or just sell the setup SD cards.
[17:28] mc: different packages
[17:28] justicefries: as well as putting the SD card image up for free.
[17:28] mc: one that's just the board with an sd card full of software
[17:28] Brandon_R: make it cheap and free
[17:28] mc: one that includes a monitor, keyboard, and mouse
[17:29] trivol: Hi ! I'm completely new to Node (coming from rails) and I struggle with node since this morning. I just try to setup a basic Node + Express + mangouse following MVC pattern but without success. I found lot of resource online but always outdated :/ . Do you know something recent who could explain me how to do that ?
[17:29] diogogmt has joined the channel
[17:29] justicefries: there's going to be a supply problem for a little while, I think there's 2 million people interested in buying a raspberry pi or many?
[17:29] sandfox: trivoli: what problems, errors are you having? 
[17:30] uchuff has joined the channel
[17:30] justicefries: and then maybe resources for kids building their first web app using node + redis.
[17:30] JSONB has joined the channel
[17:30] justicefries: I think redis is a great way to learn how to do persistence.
[17:30] mc: justicefries: you should start with software
[17:30] justicefries: yeah
[17:31] justicefries: that's ture.
[17:31] justicefries: true
[17:31] justicefries: make it so you can just plug in the SD card and go.
[17:31] mc: if you know you can make node work on arm, then write your software to use node
[17:31] mc: then it's cross platform
[17:31] justicefries: yeah
[17:31] infynyxx has joined the channel

[17:33] AviMarcus has joined the channel
[17:34] justicefries: that's what I'm thinking, mc.

[17:38] trivol: sandfox: Thx, I'll take a look
[17:39] sandfox: trivol: also, take small steps, I got really annoyed with mongoose when I took big jumps and it didn't do what I thought it should do
[17:39] ericmuyser has joined the channel
[17:39] justicefries: mc: cloud9 would be good...and I forgot about nide!
[17:39] hh__: so so
[17:40] hh__: you guys know if they'll have order limits for raspberry pi
[17:40] hh__: i dont think supply will ever meet demand till maybe a year from now or who knows
[17:40] justicefries: you can only order 1 right now.
[17:41] jocafa has joined the channel
[17:41] alexrbarlow has joined the channel
[17:41] hh__: is registering for interest basically meaning they reserve one for X amount of time or is it just a simple alert when its in stock
[17:41] alek_b_ has joined the channel
[17:41] trivol: sandfox: I try to follow a smotth curve but It's quiet difficult to found uptodate tutorial since Node and all the module are in heavy development
[17:41] justicefries: the latter
[17:41] hh__: nice
[17:41] hh__: so i got a chance at this thing then
[17:42] sandfox: trivol: yeah, it's a major PITA but the only other thing to do is find other open source projects using it and see how they do stuff
[17:43] phluffy has joined the channel
[17:43] hh__: the first batch was what? 10,000 units? so i don't think they'll meet demand anytime soon if they can only produce that much in several weeks
[17:44] justicefries: I think so yeah, it'll ramp up though.
[17:44] hh__: you know, if all 2 million supposed people are waiting for one

[17:46] hh__: honestly the docs are really good for express/mongoose
[17:46] ramitos has joined the channel
[17:46] hh__: just stay with the docs
[17:47] hh__: if you can't figure it out by looking over express/mongoose docs, then i dont think you know javascript very well
[17:48] hh__: which would be the main issue you should try to address
[17:48] sandfox: hh__: sometimes the how can be easy, but the what to do with it a bit harder
[17:49] newcode: has any of you some experience installing less for use with node?
[17:49] newcode: less css
[17:50] hh__: what about it? doesn't it just install a exe cutable for you to use?

[17:57] Brandon_R: is there a library that allows one to do object oriented css?
[17:57] michaelmartinez: What constitutes a "large project" in y'alls opinion? I keep hearing this on podcasts, etc.
[17:57] SubStack: brainss: ok it's on my calendar
[17:57] justicefries: that's perfect. the nodeboard.
[17:58] brainss: SubStack: yeah, just keep it simple. pure awesomeness doesn't need an explanation
[17:58] Brandon_R: a large project is any project that uses a full stack dev kit
[17:59] Brandon_R: uses tests and agile development and design patterns
[17:59] Aria: .oO(By that definition, then System/360 wasn't a large project)
[17:59] michaelmartinez: Brandon_R: What do you mean by "use"... does that have a definition?
[17:59] SubStack: a large project is an unstable isotope that will decay into several smaller, easier to maintain projects when acted upon by sufficient activation energy
[17:59] Aria: Brandon_R: What would object oriented CSS look like? CSS is a set of rules -- and tying them to various root nodes as objects is as object oriented as I can imagine.
[17:59] michaelmartinez: I mean, I could have a simple website nestled into a full stack right?
[17:59] Aria: (Like is easy with Less)
[18:00] Aria: (OR stylus)
[18:00] Brandon_R: object oriented css would be you have a class called red and you extend it to a class called Red_Button and red button has all the properties like red
[18:00] michaelmartinez: Substack: like protein folding algo's?
[18:00] justicefries: I'd say a large project is one that starts to involve multiple complex business domains.
[18:00] nibblebot has joined the channel
[18:00] Brandon_R: that's a good definition justicefries

[18:03] justicefries: yeah.
[18:03] alessioalex has joined the channel
[18:03] justicefries: exactly. whether or not it's SOA or separation of concerns, doesn't mean you have multiple projects - I wouldn't consider two repos = two projects. :)
[18:03] Brandon_R: that shirt will only be funny in the business domain
[18:04] sandfox: yeah, one project can be across multiple repos if it makes sense
[18:04] michaelmartinez: Ok, I was finding this difficult to reason about, because I've never worked on something that wasn't trivial. So thank you.
[18:04] SubStack: michaelmartinez: then you're doing it right!
[18:04] justicefries: and each one is a project in its own right.
[18:04] sandfox: project composed of multiple modules composed of multiple classes files etc etc

[18:06] Brandon_R: do you have authority to arrest people?
[18:06] sandfox: SubStack: yep, agree completely, a project should made of modules (which may themselves be made of modules), ideally a project should be some glue code to join them together. turtles all the way down :-)
[18:06] michaelmartinez: No, but we kick down doors when the house is buring
[18:06] SubStack: indeed!
[18:07] Brandon_R: i like that idea about node

[18:13] Brandon_R: on the other hand dart is java
[18:14] Brandon_R: amirite?
[18:14] Brandon_R: is a collection of libs a framework?

[18:17] SubStack: libraries can abstract over other libraries
[18:17] infynyxx has joined the channel
[18:17] SubStack: it doesn't even matter what libraries they use most times
[18:18] Gatoradecode: I guess I am asking, how long does it take a good node.js programmer to write a 1-on-1 chat server that can handle 500 concurrent "rooms"?
[18:18] SubStack: but the criterions by which we label a project a framework seem to be at issue here
[18:19] mikeal has joined the channel
[18:19] Brandon_R: not long
[18:19] rendar: SubStack: what i mean, consider for example a framework like Qt, it gives to the developer the same api style for gui, network etc
[18:19] Brandon_R: how do you store rooms is the question
[18:19] Brandon_R: and how do you store sockets
[18:19] SubStack: code generation scaffolding is a pretty good indicator for instance, rails style
[18:19] SubStack: rendar: I haven't used qt
[18:19] Brandon_R: how many users per room gatoradecode?
[18:19] SubStack: maybe we need better terms for discussing these things
[18:20] rendar: yep :)
[18:20] westg: I have a field in a doc which contains a string that identifies the name of a particular database (other than the one the doc is in). I want to be able to connect to that new database based on the the doc being retrieved. the problem is that I don't know if it's a good idea to open multiple database connections like that and I don't know if the database connection will be reused if I'm trying 
[18:20] westg: to connect to the same database that already has an active connection
[18:20] sandfox: Gatoradecode: 1 day with some bugs and a messy design :-)
[18:21] sandfox: Gatoradecode: and not including any fronted stuff...
[18:21] Brandon_R: gatoradecode:  1 hour because socket.io already does that
[18:21] westg: win ^
[18:22] rendar: SubStack: i try to explain my point: both frameworks and libs give to the user N apis to work with, the difference is that libraries are very specific component of a project, so for example i'll use libA and libB in a project, and libA and libB will have a totally different style of apis, instead, a framework can abstract them and give to me a more concrete set of apis..
[18:22] sandfox: render: are we assuming that libA and libB do similar things?
[18:23] rendar: no they do different things e.g. libA=gui libB=network
[18:23] SubStack: rendar: different libraries don't necessarily have different styles
[18:23] Brandon_R_ has joined the channel
[18:24] SubStack: why would it make sense to use a framework that lumps disperate things together?
[18:24] sandfox: rendar: are we assuming style difference aren't a by product of being the optimum way of dealing with the domain they are in?
[18:24] Brandon_R_: frameworks are tested whereas libs are not?
[18:24] rendar: SubStack:  yes, but they often do..and a glue code for interacting them is needed, otherwise frameworks provide that for you (e.g. signal/slot mechanism in Qt which lets you to connect gui components with network components in a clear manner
[18:24] sandfox: Brandon_R: no testing is evil no matter where it's not happening...
[18:26] sandfox: Brandon_R: if your foundations aren't stable then you are really setting your self up for some epic fail at some point, a library shouldn't try to protect you from bugs in sub libraries...
[18:26] rendar: sandfox: nope, some differences can be just differences, without to be tight to the domain of problem they solve..
[18:27] Brandon_R_: not tested as in unit test
[18:27] Brandon_R_: tested as in used for ever 10 years
[18:27] Brandon_R_: in bank software etc
[18:27] timoxley has joined the channel
[18:29] sandfox: Brandon_R: I don't think there is any difference in practice, tests are tests no matter what name you give them.. (yes there are different type's like integration, unit, etc but I think we are dealing with a layer above this)
[18:29] jkridner_ has joined the channel
[18:29] sandfox: Brandon_R: however there may well be perception differences
[18:31] bradleyg has joined the channel
[18:31] rendar: well, the NIH thing is always bad, in such way is written new code whihc can contain more bugs than the actual library, but sometimes its really needed to rewrite from scratch an old and slow library...even if it has years of testing..
[18:31] infynyxx has joined the channel
[18:32] benvie: substack, what should I use for TDD
[18:32] SubStack: first, don't do "TDD" do "write tests"
[18:32] benvie: well yes
[18:32] benvie: I mean to do the tests
[18:32] benvie: that i write
[18:32] SubStack: then use https://github.com/isaacs/node-tap
[18:32] benvie: ok cool
[18:32] rwaldron has joined the channel
[18:32] SubStack: because the api is super nice
[18:32] sandfox: rendar: then I think what you should is make a new library and replace the old one instead of wrapping it...
[18:32] benvie: I've been meaning to start doing things that way, and I'm going to now
[18:33] rendar: sandfox: yes, sure, this last my sentence aobut NIH was not related to the framework discussion of before :)
[18:33] sandfox: SubStack, where (if at all) does TAP and something like Mocha colide...
[18:33] SubStack: mocha is silly
[18:33] SubStack: globals everywhere
[18:33] benvie: yeah
[18:33] sandfox: rendar: ah-ha, my bad, getting too eager (watching the rugby at the moment and it's getting me fired up :-) )
[18:34] SubStack: and anyways what kind of test harness has multiple apis
[18:34] rendar: sandfox: eheheh! cool :)
[18:34] SubStack: and the api is configurable at runtime what is that even
[18:34] benvie: it needs to be simple and fast to use so you can focus on your thing
[18:34] mansoor: Has anyone ran Three.js on Node.js?
[18:35] sandfox: SubStack, yeah that last bit lost me, never really got the why...
[18:35] sandfox: mansoor: surely it's browser only? due to the webgl, canvas hooks etc?
[18:36] Brandon_R has joined the channel
[18:36] SubStack: mocha should really be split up into 4 or 5 separate projects
[18:36] hortinstein has joined the channel
[18:37] AntelopeSalad: substack: what's your opinion on the flatiron libs?
[18:37] sandfox: SubStack:  i've never actually touched Mocha (and i am very very bad at doing testing properly), but have been giving it thought as something to get started with and then I saw TAP.. guess I'll stick with TAP for now :-)
[18:38] hortinstein: what is the best way to add jquery to a site thats already loaded...appending strings to divs is what i was trying to do
[18:39] Brandon_R: hi
[18:40] sandfox: question to the wise: how many digits can I actually fit in a 32bit float buffer? (i'm being really daft and have confused myself)
[18:40] Brandon_R: hey, anyone here wife cheated on them?
[18:40] Brandon_R: i need some advice
[18:40] maxogden: npm install marriage-advice-robot
[18:41] AvianFlu: npm install new-mail-order-bride
[18:41] SubStack: AntelopeSalad: still a bit early but it's split up pretty well
[18:42] SubStack: I've helped a bit with ecstatic which is pretty sweet
[18:42] AntelopeSalad: at this stage of everything would you consider using bits and pieces of it instead of express?

[18:44] Brandon_R: how many concurrent connections can socket.io handle on average?
[18:44] Brandon_R: now.js says 6500
[18:44] Brandon_R: so i guess that's the hard limit on socket.io?
[18:45] AvianFlu: lol now.js says 6500 concurrent connections?
[18:45] AvianFlu: on what kind of server?
[18:45] hortinstein: 6500 seems really low
[18:45] AvianFlu: it seems really *arbitrary*
[18:45] AvianFlu: every different machine on every different network will see things differently
[18:45] Bonuspunkt: idle connections?
[18:46] Brandon_R: Single threaded NowJS can handle up to 6500 concurrent users on the chatroom example For customers that are looking for even greater scalability and reliability, we'll soon be licensing a distributed version of NowJS currently under development. Contact us at sales@nowjs.com
[18:46] mmalecki: if (numberOfConnections > 6500) throw 'sorry dawg';
[18:46] AvianFlu: hahahahahahahahaha
[18:46] Brandon_R: i think now.js hard coded 6500 so you have to buy their commercial solution
[18:46] mmalecki: ahahahahahahaha
[18:46] sandfox: what….
[18:46] AvianFlu: "single threaded nowjs"

[18:48] jarek: How can I compile Node.js so that it works on both 32bit and 64bit systems?
[18:48] Brandon_R: compile it for 32 bit
[18:48] Brandon_R: it will work on 64 bit
[18:48] Brandon_R: not necessarily the other way aroung.
[18:49] jarek: Brandon_R: if I compile it for 32bits it won't work because of missing libraries, e.g. libssl.so.1.0.0
[18:49] jarek: ^it won't work on 64bit machines
[18:50] jarek: I would prefer to ship fat binary rather than asking users to install 32 bit version of SSL

[20:54] owen1: i add 'strict mode' to my js file but don't see any errors.
[20:54] mandric has joined the channel
[20:55] owen1: is strint mode only for js or is it apply to node as well?
[20:55] timoxley: owen1 it applies to node
[20:55] benvie: only a few specific things will cause errors
[20:55] benvie: which apparently you didn't do
[20:56] timoxley: owen1 try using an undefined variable.
[20:56] ioscale: hey there, does anyone know a good overview of nodejs mvc-style frameworks? or is everyone using express?
[20:56] owen1: timoxley: i have eval('var a =5') and test = 'hi'
[20:57] timoxley: ioscale express has little to nothing to do with mvc really.
[20:57] ioscale: yes, i know :) that's why i am asking… it's pretty open.
[20:58] tylerstalder has joined the channel
[20:58] ioscale: just try to find out what people are "generally" using for apps in nodejs… most frameworks i have looked at are still pretty young (as is nodejs)
[20:58] ioscale: and feel relatively immature
[20:58] sanitypassing: is there any way of playing audio through node?
[20:59] owen1: ioscale: i use it instead of bash script or a ruby script
[20:59] owen1: ioscale: my cronjob uses a node script
[20:59] ioscale: @sanitypassing did you mean something like this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3955103/streaming-audio-from-a-node-js-server-to-html5-audio-tag
[20:59] timoxley: ioscale haven't used but are on my todo list: http://mcavage.github.com/node-restify/ http://flatironjs.org/ http://towerjs.org/ http://railwayjs.com/ http://geddyjs.org/ http://zappajs.org/
[21:00] sanitypassing: ioscale: not quite. I want to play audio on node, but not stream it
[21:00] timoxley: sanitypassing you mean, like, write an app in node that plays audio directly?
[21:00] sanitypassing: Yep,

[21:01] edmellum has left the channel
[21:01] Brandon_R: oj
[21:01] timoxley: sanitypassing not really what node is designed for as far as I can tell. kind of like how directx isn't for web servers.
[21:02] sanitypassing: timoxley: yeah, but I bet you somewhere, someone has tried it. :)
[21:02] TooTallNate: sanitypassing: try node-audio maybe
[21:02] timoxley: sanitypassing but you could shell out to some other process that could do it

[21:03] sanitypassing: also, this is OSX only.
[21:03] ioscale: @timoxley: thx for the list.

[23:03] cainus: mongo kinda sucks for relational stuff
[23:03] damiano has joined the channel

[23:07] thinkt4nk_ has joined the channel
[23:07] cainus: yeah get all the course ids first and then get all assignments for those courseids in one query
[23:07] aroman: how could I do that?
[23:08] aroman: courses and assignments are two separate collections
[23:08] cainus: step 1.  get all assignment ids
[23:08] bkaney has joined the channel
[23:08] cainus: errr sorry
[23:08] cainus: 1. get all course ids
[23:09] cainus: 2. get all assignments for those courseids  (might be in map-reduce land here... I'd have to recheck the mongo API)
[23:09] cainus: 3. jam them all together
[23:10] aroman: isn't that exactly what I'm doing, except I'm getting the entire course document and not just the id?
[23:10] dtrejo has joined the channel
[23:11] cainus: looks like $in is all you need, once you have the list of Course ids:  http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/OR+operations+in+query+expressions
[23:11] cainus: looks to me like your algo loops over the courses and queries for their assignments individually
[23:11] cainus: 100 courses = 101 queries
[23:12] aroman: 100 courses is 200 queries
[23:12] aroman: err wait
[23:12] cainus: howso?
[23:12] cainus: you can do it in 2
[23:12] cainus: heh
[23:12] aroman: nevermind, you're right
[23:12] aroman: that's what i'm doing right now, yes.

[23:15] mattgifford has joined the channel
[23:15] aroman: there's some syntactical sugar around it
[23:15] owen1: i have a constructor function called User(name)   is it reasonable to call my static function User.find from within it?
[23:15] Brandon_R: does anyone here know of a mapreduce written in pure c?
[23:17] cainus: Brandon_r: not sure how that makes sense :)
[23:17] aroman: cainus: hmm, so if I need an array of the course_id's I want, I need to re-zip the courses I get back into an array
[23:17] Brandon_R: i looked at hadroop
[23:18] Brandon_R: but it's written in java
[23:18] aroman: because I can't just pluck the course_id from the courses collection -- I need to return the other attributes
[23:19] fomatin has joined the channel
[23:19] cainus: aroman: why not just get all attrs but pluck out the ids for the second query?
[23:20] cainus: Brandon_R: so?
[23:20] aroman: cainus: pluck them out with like a regular old JS forEach loop?
[23:20] cainus: _.pluck is my favorite way :)
[23:20] aroman: i don't have underscore xD
[23:20] owen1: i need guidance about desigining my api for a user model.
[23:21] cainus: well you could require() it... or just do good-old-fashioned for loops... don't do 2 queries to mongo just because you're too lazy to pluck though ;)
[23:21] owen1: i am not sure which functions should be object and which should be static..
[23:21] aroman: yeah that's definitely a better idea. but yeah i might as well use underscore server-side.. I use it all the time on the client (with Backbone)
[23:21] owen1: basicaly i need a module that will interact with a users collections.
[23:22] cainus: yeah I try not to write javascript without underscore ;)

[23:28] owen1: cainus: User is a constructor function. i am not sure what should be the purpose of this funcion. should it go to the mongo and bring back the user by it's name?
[23:28] cainus: owen1: you might actually want to go with mongoose like aroman if you want model objects like that... 
[23:28] owen1: if that's the case, user = new User('dan') will not work since i want to do it async.
[23:29] mmalecki: getters should be static functions
[23:29] mmalecki: User.get('dan'), etc.
[23:29] mmalecki: constructor shouldn't perform any I/O
[23:29] mattgifford has joined the channel
[23:29] owen1: mmalecki: got it.
[23:30] owen1: mmalecki: so get will by somthing like this: User.get('dan', addProduct) 
[23:30] owen1: ?
[23:30] owen1: by=do
[23:30] mmalecki: owen1: yeah, User.get('dan', callback)
[23:30] owen1: since it's async, i have to pass a callback.
[23:30] mmalecki: yup
[23:30] cainus: mmalecki: resourceful looks good... I'd never seen that
[23:31] owen1: mmalecki: so in the case of adding products to a user, i don't even neeed to use new ( user = new User() )

[23:31] mmalecki: cainus: :) check out flatiron in general, https://github.com/flatiron/
[23:32] owen1: mmalecki: and maybe i don't even need the constructor function?
[23:32] aroman: cainus: this is what I'm sticking with, it looks like. https://gist.github.com/2066519 You score 30 Internet points for getting me to use underscore on the server w/ mongodb. awesome combo.
[23:32] mmalecki: owen1: yeah, you probably want to leave it empty unless you initialize some properties
[23:33] aroman: 2 queries.
[23:33] owen1: mmalecki: ok. thanks! going to try your advice.

[23:42] cainus: I was just looking at https://github.com/flatiron/resourceful/tree/master/lib/resourceful/engines
[23:42] cainus: for some reason couch gets the primetime treatment ;)
