[00:42] davehamptonusa: isaacs:  I'm setting up a local npm repository within my company, yet still  need to restrict access to either individuals or internal ip's.  Do you recommend setting up that authentication in couchdb's users and security tables or via a front end proxy to couchdb using mod_access or something similar?
[00:44] isaacs: davehamptonusa: whatever's easier.
[00:44] isaacs: davehamptonusa: couch's security tables can probably do what you want, but mod_access has a lot of configurability
[00:45] davehamptonusa: will npm prompt for user/password on GETS if security is in place at the couchdb level?
[00:45] davehamptonusa: as it does for publishing?
[00:45] isaacs: davehamptonusa: no.  you can set the always-auth config flag to make it always send auth
[00:45] isaacs: davehamptonusa: i mean, not by default, unless you hit that flag
[00:46] davehamptonusa: ok.  So, without thhe auth-config flag - it will just fail to get
[00:47] davehamptonusa: issacs: s/always-config/always-auth/
[00:47] isaacs: davehamptonusa: yeah
[00:47] isaacs: davehamptonusa: i don't think it's smart enough to respond to a 401 by re-requesting with auth
[00:47] gr4yscale has joined the channel
[00:51] davehamptonusa: Does always_auth send what is stored in .npmrc, or prompt before connecting?
[00:51] hexTech has joined the channel
[00:52] dreamr has joined the channel
[00:52] isaacs: davehamptonusa: what's in .npmrc
[00:52] isaacs: davehamptonusa: so you still have to npm adduser
[00:52] davehamptonusa: isaacs:  the email and _auth from publishing
[00:52] isaacs: davehamptonusa: just the _auth
[00:52] isaacs: davehamptonusa: the email is just for setting the maintainers field
[00:52] replore_ has joined the channel
[00:52] replore has joined the channel
[00:53] davehamptonusa: isaacs: so the auth is more of a token
[00:53] isaacs: davehamptonusa: it's Base64<username + ":" + password>
[00:53] davehamptonusa: isaacs: awesome.  Then I'll just make a security document and manage from there
[00:54] davehamptonusa: isaacs:  From within couchdb that is... 
[00:54] isaacs: davehamptonusa: that should work, then

[01:44] ningu: but I can imagine what it does
[01:44] ningu: anyway, yes, race is defined correctly
[01:44] ningu: if by correctly you mean you want a ref and want to be able to populate it
[01:45] ningu: but you have to tell mongoose to populate it
[01:45] dreamr: i guess. but I get raceId instead of race
[01:45] dreamr: ahh
[01:45] dreamr: ok ill look into that part
[01:45] dreamr: thanks
[01:45] ningu: well, that part is identical to the sql case

[02:55] SamBarboza: tuhoojabotti
[02:55] SamBarboza: are you an expert?
[02:56] maxogden: SamBarboza: state your case and the room shall judge
[02:57] SamBarboza: Ok. I'm creating a service, that sends the user data through socket.io. But the app can't be used by two (or more) people at same time, its variables get confused.
[02:57] Wa has joined the channel
[02:57] SamBarboza: and one people receives other data and vice versa.
[02:57] sven_oostenbrink has joined the channel
[02:57] SamBarboza: Should I use child process ?
[02:57] SubStack: SamBarboza: don't use .broadcast()
[02:57] copongcopong: session id checking?
[02:57] maxogden: SamBarboza: each socketio connection has unique ids and stuff on it
[02:58] SamBarboza: yeah.
[02:58] SubStack: you can call .send() on each connection individually
[02:59] SamBarboza: Should I avoid the use of child process?
[02:59] SubStack: SamBarboza: that doesn't even make sense for the scope of your problem
[02:59] maxogden: child process is for spawning child processes, you have a process already
[03:00] SamBarboza: hm...
[03:00] SamBarboza: Ok.
[03:00] SubStack: also you should gist your code
[03:00] SamBarboza: My problem is that, users data get confused throught them
[03:00] SubStack: then people can look at it and help you out
[03:00] SamBarboza: Ok.
[03:00] SamBarboza: Let me gist it.
[03:00] tuhoojabotti: I said, good night.
[03:00] SamBarboza: https://github.com/sambarboza/Retweets/blob/master/retweets.js
[03:01] SamBarboza: Here is the code.
[03:01] SamBarboza: What I need is that each user, get its own data.
[03:01] SamBarboza: I think that I'm doing all wrong.
[03:01] maxogden: io.sockets.emit sends it to everyone
[03:02] RyanS__ has joined the channel
[03:02] maxogden: you wanna only emit to the socket var in the callback here https://github.com/sambarboza/Retweets/blob/master/retweets.js#L251
[03:03] nodebiscut has joined the channel
[03:03] blubberbob has joined the channel

[03:04] SamBarboza: are you looking it?
[03:05] Skaag has joined the channel
[03:06] maxogden: yes that is how i gave you the suggestion above. retweetsOfMe calls parseTweets which calls getRetweets which does io.sockets.emit
[03:06] SamBarboza: So, should i send io.sockets.socket(socketid).emit
[03:07] SamBarboza: irhgt?
[03:07] SamBarboza: rifht?
[03:07] SamBarboza: dam
[03:07] maxogden: ummm something like that
[03:07] SamBarboza: damm
[03:07] teadict: who's done backbone + socket.io?
[03:07] maxogden: SamBarboza: are you related to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hector_Barbossa
[03:07] SamBarboza: No no hehe
[03:07] teadict: is it messy to mix them?
[03:07] maxogden: SamBarboza: i dunno the exact syntax but youre on the right track with that 
[03:07] SamBarboza: I tried this.
[03:07] SamBarboza: but it isn't enough.

[03:36] kmiyashiro has joined the channel
[03:36] wiel: how i initially submit the form is by passing the parameters in the address but Im stumped as to how to pass the params to this new link
[03:36] tmike: mudman I can't think of any.  It might be easier to load them just before you need them, but depending on the activity of your application that probably wouldn't save you much.
[03:36] bicranial has joined the channel
[03:36] tmike: wiel I'm sure curl can do something
[03:37] tmike: And node will let you form post requests too
[03:39] r04r has joined the channel
[03:40] mudman: tmike: The node.js server side will always be running, there are not form posts from node.js
[03:40] tmike: You can't form POST requests?
[03:40] mudman: tmike: Oh cross topic, nevermind.
[03:41] tmike: lol sorry about that
[03:42] mudman: tmike: The reason for wanting to load everything up front instead of delayed is so that I don't have to worry about something being available and I can just do something like var person = new My.Models.Person(); without worrying if it's been required yet or not.
[03:42] tmike: yeah go for it

[05:48] SubStack: and testling is basically just node-tap with a few extras
[05:48] SubStack: you can pretty much just take a tap test and replace the require('tap').test with require('testling') and it'll work on testling
[05:48] SubStack: PLUS, tap just got awesome diffs
[05:48] SubStack: http://substack.net/images/screenshots/tap_using_difflet.png

[05:49] r04r has joined the channel
[05:50] SubStack: yeah jsTestDriver is ridiculous >_<
[05:50] SubStack: selenium is not designed for unit tests and repurposing it to do them is amazingly awkward
[05:50] wingie: is there a way to cache readFile() so the subsequents call reading the same file will use the cache and not hit the fs?
[05:51] wingie: or is it recommended i just do it manually in a wrapper function
[05:51] brainproxy: SubStack: it allows for one to detect that a side-effect has occurred
[05:51] jesusabdullah: wingie: just save the results in memory
[05:51] brainproxy: w/o having to wire up an eventemitter or something else around that side-effect
[05:51] SubStack: oh I see
[05:52] SubStack: what sort of side-effects?
[05:52] brainproxy: SubStack: it's not the best solution at all times, but it's just the simplest thing to do in certain circumstances
[05:52] brainproxy: like that variable x has changed from value 0 to value 'another value'
[05:52] brainproxy: or whatever
[05:52] SubStack: hmmm
[05:52] michaelmartinez: it works, when a pro like cjno writes the tests it damn sure better. Howev, when I dove in... yikes
[05:53] SubStack: does it just poll x for changes?
[05:53] brainproxy: SubStack: yes, which is why it's useful more for testing and not recommended for wiring together production logic
[05:53] brainproxy: because it's obviously fragile
[05:53] brainproxy: and subject to glitches
[05:53] brainproxy: but in certain situations, like writing specs w/ mocha, it's nice
[05:53] r04r has joined the channel
[05:54] SubStack: sounds easy to do with just setInterval/clearInterval?
[05:56] brainproxy: well yes, but then maybe you want timeout logic, maybe a timeout message, and so on
[05:56] deeprogram has joined the channel
[05:56] SubStack: oh that makes sense then
[05:56] brainproxy: and if if you're doing it many times, across test suites ... well, then its nice to encapsulate
[05:56] SubStack: I just hate jasmine is all :p
[05:57] SubStack: and any test harness that pukes a bunch of globals into your namespace
[05:57] brainproxy: lol, well I'm off the sauce, and mocha is my new hotness
[05:57] brainproxy: but I missed jasmine's waitsFor
[05:57] satyr has joined the channel
[05:57] brainproxy: SubStack: what test harness to you like?
[05:57] SubStack: tap
[05:58] SubStack: is my current favorite
[05:58] SubStack: and testling api is highly influenced by it
[05:58] brainproxy: cool
[05:59] r04r has joined the channel
[05:59] brainproxy: well anyway, waitsFor is completely generic and doesn't do anything funny w/ globals, so it can be used w/ whatever
[05:59] brainproxy: the mention of jasmine is just to give a sense of where it came from
[05:59] SubStack: makes sense
[06:00] SubStack: is it on npm?
[06:00] philips_ has joined the channel
[06:00] brainproxy: yup, `npm install waitsFor`
[06:00] SubStack: aha I see that it is
[06:00] SubStack: good stuff
[06:00] brainproxy: thanks for your feedback btw
[06:00] brainproxy: it's good to have someone force you to justify where/how dev time is spent

[06:01] SubStack: yeah totally
[06:01] SubStack: also check this http://testling.com/docs/#using-npm
[06:01] SubStack: if you want to use waitsFor with testling for browser tests it's super easy!

[06:40] jesusabdullah: you may need to run that as root IamRyo 
[06:40] IamRyo: I tried sudo too
[06:40] jesusabdullah: you *are* globally installing it after all!
[06:40] IamRyo: No dice
[06:40] IamRyo: maybe try no global?
[06:40] jesusabdullah: naw
[06:41] jesusabdullah: that'd install it locally
[06:41] IamRyo: YEah, it didn't work anyways
[06:41] isaacs: IamRyo: npm -v <-- what's that print out
[06:41] IamRyo: I get an error
[06:41] jesusabdullah: damn son
[06:41] jesusabdullah: when npm -v throws it's time to get a new npm
[06:41] IamRyo: right?
[06:42] IamRyo: expand on that?
[06:42] isaacs: IamRyo: also, why is npm in /usr/lib/node_modules rather than /usr/local/lib/node_modules?

[06:43] isaacs: the pkg installer for a mac?
[06:43] IamRyo: yeah
[06:43] isaacs: ok
[06:43] isaacs: run this: `which node`
[06:43] isaacs: what's that show you?
[06:43] IamRyo: usr/local/bin/node
[06:43] isaacs: ok
[06:44] isaacs: so... why is npm in /usr/bin/npm
[06:44] isaacs: rather than /usr/local/bin
[06:44] isaacs: did you install some other version once upon a time?
[06:44] IamRyo: got me...
[06:44] isaacs: IamRyo: which npm
[06:44] isaacs: run that^
[06:44] IamRyo: usr/bin/npm
[06:45] isaacs: sudo mv /usr/bin/npm{,-BROKEN} ; hash -r ; npm -v
[06:45] IamRyo: I think I'm seeing the problem here...
[06:45] isaacs: :D
[06:45] isaacs: if you used the mac pkg installer, you have some working version of npm in /usr/local/bin/npm, I'm guessing.
[06:45] isaacs: but /usr/bin/npm is first in your path.

[06:55] nowjs8: but i will have more and more users, so i need a way to scale the system. 
[06:55] nowjs8: i have looked the demo chat written with node.js however i need a distribted system
[06:55] nowjs8: any recommendations*
[06:56] r04r has joined the channel
[06:59] Emmanuel`: nowjs8: what do you mean with distributed system for chat ?
[06:59] Emmanuel`: you mean several, synchronised,  chat server 
[06:59] blueadept: what happens if you dont declare a variable specically through the var init in node.js? does the compiler just tack it on?
[07:00] mansoor has joined the channel
[07:00] nowjs8: Emmanuel`: yes i mean it
[07:01] nowjs8: Emmanuel`: meaning, i will never have 1000-2000 users. so i need to have more than 1 server and a scalable system

[07:19] Emmanuel`: nowjs8: you will never have 1000 users ?
[07:19] Emmanuel`: then why would you need scalability
[07:19] Emmanuel`: what kind of protocol do you want to use ?
[07:20] Emmanuel`: you should definitely use xmpp, I don't see any good reason to redevelop these kind of thing with node
[07:20] Emmanuel`: (but I might be wrong)

[07:20] Emmanuel`: if you really have strong need, even an IRC server (that is : the thing you are connected at right now) would be good
[07:22] nowjs8: Emmanuel`: : thanks but i know what is internet relay chat :)
[07:22] nowjs8: Emmanuel`: : i am trying to accomplish "whatzapp"
[07:22] nowjs8: you know it ?
[07:22] Emmanuel`: I kind of assumed you did :)
[07:22] Emmanuel`: I know whatsapp
[07:23] nowjs8: so, do you think node.js is suitable for a such solution ?
[07:23] Emmanuel`: probably, but that sounds a bit overkill
[07:23] nowjs8: i see that as node.js is asnyc, it can handle many concurrent connections at the same time
[07:23] Emmanuel`: as any xmpp server would do
[07:24] dlg: its more webscale
[07:24] nowjs8: Emmanuel`: so i should setup a xmpp server and write soem code in html5 for clients and let them chat each other running xmpp server ?

[08:48] tomoj: suppose you're writing a node.js process which will be entirely devoted to streaming data from some source out over stdio - another process will start you and ask for messages by writing 'next\n' into your stdin, then reading messages until you send 'sync', at which point it loops
[08:48] tomoj: if you have no messages available, you are expected to sleep (..setTimeout?) for 1ms to avoid pegging the cpu, or you can just peg the cpu if you don't care

[08:51] booyaa: is isodate long date? yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss ?
[08:51] tomoj: you're expected to send a sync without blocking for too long after 'next', because the parent process might also notify you with a status message instead of sending 'next', and while it is waiting for 'sync' it will not send these
[08:51] tomoj: what damage will this cause to an event-brained node.js programmer working under this framework?

[10:18] oal: Probably a common question around here, but how do you avoid boomerang/banana code and callback hell? Is the "async" module what you'd recommend?
[10:19] booyaa: cal, there are a lot of async modules. check out toolbox.no.de or search.npmjs.org to find one you like the sound of
[10:19] booyaa: i think dailyjs.com did a review of the most widely used ones

[10:23] rurufufuss: booyaa: keystore
[10:23] rurufufuss: well, since most web apps are stateless, everything is usually done by "pull from db, modify, push back to db", sometimes with caching etc
[10:23] rurufufuss: but what about if you have a highly dynamic object (e.g a chatroom)
[10:24] booyaa: rurufufuss: use messagequeue technology since it's closer to that type of application?
[10:24] robi42 has joined the channel
[10:25] rurufufuss: booyaa: like redis pubsub?
[10:25] booyaa: rabbitmq
[10:25] booyaa: i think pusher may even be in this arena
[10:25] abraxas: any c++ addon developers on who could quickly verify something for me?
[10:26] abraxas: I see bugs in other people's code (or I'm really confused about what I read)
[10:26] rurufufuss: cool, thanks, will tkae a look
[10:26] booyaa: rurufufuss: dunno about pubsub, well not used it, but i suspect subscribing to new chat events could work
[10:26] booyaa: rurufufuss: how does the multi nodedness work? are you trying to load balance a chat server?
[10:27] rurufufuss: booyaa: suppose I made a chat app in node.js
[10:27] dubenstein has joined the channel
[10:27] rurufufuss: and everything's going fine for one node (every chatroom object) is held in one server
[10:27] rurufufuss: how does one scale up from one server to two?
[10:28] booyaa: right i get you
[10:28] booyaa: rurufufuss: i think you want to think about clustering technology too in addtiojn to shaerd storage/or message queues

[10:29] booyaa: thinsg like hookio or i think dnode
[10:29] r04r has joined the channel

[10:29] rurufufuss: .. this sounds like reimplementing IRC haha
[10:29] catb0t:  Exception: SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
[10:29] SubStack: dnode would more be for letting the servers talk to each other
[10:30] SubStack: redis might be a better fit for sharing state like that

[10:49] ningu: SubStack: no, it went the other way around historically -- it's call x*ML* after all
[10:50] SubStack: really? the first time I saw it I thought "yes, fucking finally"

[10:51] torvalamo: i remember when xhtml was all the hype. that wasn't so long ago. i think it was last week.
[10:51] benvie: dhtml is where it's at
[10:51] ningu: yes, but html actually is a markup language
[10:51] margle has joined the channel
[10:51] torvalamo: oh hell yeah, dhtml
[10:51] benvie: remember that shit?
[10:51] torvalamo: dude i got a menu that follows the page as you scroll!
[10:51] benvie: that was javascript once upon a time...dhtml
[10:52] torvalamo: i also hae a bunny for a cursor
[10:52] maritz: torvalamo: me too, but it's a sticky note i put on my bosses monitor. works great.
[10:52] ningu: I was just reading about dart
[10:52] rjack has joined the channel
[10:52] ningu: wonder if it will ever come to pass
[10:52] torvalamo: of course it will
[10:53] torvalamo: it's google, they'll make it. the question is if people will use it
[10:53] benvie: it's not going to displace javascript in the foreseeable future
[10:53] ningu: that's what I meant
[10:53] ningu: I know they'll make it
[10:53] r04r has joined the channel
[10:53] ningu: but imo, js, though flawed, is basically a good language that can be made to do what you want with a bit of effort perhaps for browser cross-compat
[10:53] torvalamo: it's technically not a replacement for js, is it? it's more of a replacement for a webpage. at least that's what i got out of it.
[10:53] benvie: there's too much intertia behind what exists. You're more likely to see changes pop up as part of shifts to completely different mediums
[10:54] ningu: I don't think js is that flawed, it's just a bit messy with some odd semantics for historical reasons
[10:54] benvie: the story for the web medium has been written
[10:54] benvie: the html/css/js/document whatever
[10:54] benvie: that's not going to change
[10:54] torvalamo: sure it is
[10:54] ningu: well, I don't mean whether browsers will drop support for js, which presumably they won't
[10:54] ningu: but whether new sites will shift
[10:54] benvie: well no, they won't
[10:55] jimmysparkle has left the channel
[10:55] torvalamo: i can totally foresee html disappearing into oblivion
[10:55] ningu: html5 support is real enough and will be a big change
[10:55] benvie: it would need to be something that was largely isolated from what exists
[10:55] OmidRaha has joined the channel
[10:55] ningu: there is already a fair amount of html5 support in webkit, right?
[10:55] benvie: sites won't just switch to something
[10:56] torvalamo: from an objective point of view html is a clunky and far too static way to create apps...
[10:56] benvie: it needs to have 95% support amongst their customers first
[10:56] benvie: and how will that happen
[10:56] torvalamo: i'm sure some genius will come up with a new way to define apps
[10:56] richardr has joined the channel
[10:56] ningu: well, apps are not pure html, I doubt they ever could be
[10:56] torvalamo: like a DOM-thingy without the HTML fuzz
[10:57] ningu: in fact, those xml "programming languages" always made me wonder what those people were smoking :)
[10:57] benvie: yeah I'm just saying you're more likely to see the whole medium displaced than to see say javascript replaced by dart or anything in what we call the web now
[10:57] torvalamo: xslt anyone?
[10:57] benvie: or html or any of the pillars
[10:57] torvalamo: with sugar?
[10:57] ningu: someone made something called X++
[10:57] rendar: i think the first thing to do, is change http
[10:58] benvie: virtual reality has to come some day right
[10:58] larsschenk has joined the channel
[10:58] ningu: http is successful because it's so simple, though
[10:58] benvie: when http ceases being a sufficient pipe for piping in our virtual reality headsets
[10:58] looopy has joined the channel
[10:58] r04r has joined the channel
[10:58] larsschenk has left the channel
[10:58] torvalamo: actually http itself isn't too bad, you just need to upgrade it a bit to allow for two-way communication
[10:58] benvie: and we need laser-http-ULTRA
[10:58] rendar: then, also urls has an old syntax, often friends of mine paste to me urls of about 800 charachters, where 780 are sha hashes or something, wouldn't it cool pass just a name?
[10:59] benvie: usually you see new technologies simply adapting and monkeypatching existing stuff. It takes a real fundamental technological shift to outright build something new
[10:59] torvalamo: you mean like a domain name?
[10:59] rendar: i think the things should be re-thinked from the ground up for the future..
[10:59] torvalamo: i remember those days
[11:00] ts___: is there a way to do something like this in node : var module = require('some source code in a string') ?
[11:00] rendar: torvalamo: yes, instead of http://imgur.com/49d94if i pass you just rendar/fun_pic
[11:00] ningu: the old days when a man was lord of his domain (name)?
[11:00] torvalamo: rendar, so essentially a context-based address system?
[11:00] ningu: ts___: eval?
[11:00] torvalamo: what a shit idea if i ever heard one
[11:00] torvalamo: no offense
[11:01] blup has joined the channel
[11:01] rendar: torvalamo: a context-based? nope..
[11:01] torvalamo: that's like telling the post office to deliver a postcard to your neighbour... and you just put "neighbour" on it
[11:02] ningu: rendar: ok, but there aren't a small number of users, won't the names get just as ugly?
[11:02] ts___: ningu: so if i load a module js file and pass it to eval is the same as require(moduleFilename) ? 
[11:02] rendar: names+namespaces and hierarchy, like actual DNS, but more modern
[11:02] ningu: ts___: eval just takes a string and evaluates the code in it, it can come from wherever
[11:02] torvalamo: namespaces = context based
[11:02] ningu: it isn't a node feature
[11:02] rendar: look at the companies which reigsters bookmar.ks chatwith.me and so on
[11:03] r04r has joined the channel
[11:03] r04r has joined the channel
[11:03] ts___: alright 
[11:03] rendar: that .me or .ks TLDs are not used for countries anymore, but just as name extension.. :)
[11:03] dekub has left the channel
[11:03] torvalamo: I KNOW
[11:03] d0k has joined the channel
[11:04] ningu: ts___: eval(string), you can do that in js generally
[11:04] ts___: yep
[11:04] ningu: although it's dangerous to do for user-passed code obviously
[11:04] torvalamo: i've decided to stop telling people that
[11:05] ningu: haha
[11:05] torvalamo: i wanna see what the worst thing that can happen is
[11:05] rendar: torvalamo: don't you think its quite unuseful using TLDs in that way? maybe just names like 'chatwithme' or 'bookmarks' would be cool, i was saying just that..
[11:05] torvalamo: rendar, i know what you mean, but who's to say who gets 'bookmarks' when there are dozens of bookmarks.something sites
[11:06] plutoniix has joined the channel
[11:07] rendar: torvalamo: it happens also now, you can have only 1 bookmar.ks domain name, you first register it, you have it, it will happen in this way, if you register 'bookmarks' you have it, other will register some other name..
[11:07] torvalamo: yeah but then essentially it would be a domain name system with no extensions and less available domains
[11:07] torvalamo: how does that help?
[11:08] rendar: torvalamo: wrong, because in that case there will be namespaces which helps to have much more available domains, even more than now can exist with these limited TLDs
[11:08] r04r has joined the channel
[11:09] torvalamo: so how would these namespaces work then

[11:12] c0smikdebris has joined the channel
[11:13] rendar: torvalamo: well, this is a good question, and not of easy solution, you can have a global namespace, like happens now, then stuff-related namespaces, user-defined namspaces..and so on, it will help also with searching something related by argument as happens in android/iOS market, when you search an application, instead of having a context-less search engine like google which have to process 
[11:13] rendar: millions of pages..

[11:34] kolektiv: so maxAge: 86400000 (one day) ends up in the browser as 86400 (1/1000 of a day)
[11:34] kolektiv: anyone seen this before?!

[11:41] janjongboom: oh i think the browser expects it in seconds
[11:41] janjongboom: and connect in ms

[11:41] janjongboom: it just seems off if you check HTTP headers
[11:42] airandfingers has joined the channel

[11:43] RLa: also, not all browsers treat max-age same

[13:30] Industrial: Gloorian: erm, http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/fs.html#fs.readFile ?
[13:30] Industrial: The callback is passed two arguments (err, data), where data is the contents of the file.
[13:31] Industrial: check the contents of data.
[13:31] Gloorian: yes
[13:31] fumanchu182 has joined the channel

[13:31] Gloorian: but it seems that even if the file is empty, the if(data) returns true

[13:32] Yester_x2: if(data == "" || data === undefined) {  }
[13:32] infynyxx has joined the channel
[13:32] janjongboom: either do fs.readFile(path, "utf8", function (err, data) so data is a string
[13:33] janjongboom: and you can do if (!data) {}
[13:33] janjongboom: or check for data.length
[13:33] janjongboom: because data is a Buffer in that case, and has length = 0 when no content is there
[13:33] Gloorian: ok, thank you :D

[13:39] MartinCleaver: thanks janjongboom -- so,  https://github.com/mrjcleaver/freshbooks-javascript-library/tree/master/library/FreshBooks/TimeEntry.js needs Element.js for a definition of FreshBooks_Element()
[13:39] janjongboom: reference it on top of your file, with a relative url
[13:40] janjongboom: lemme check ur folder structure
[13:40] janjongboom: just do
[13:40] janjongboom: var Element = require("./Element")
[13:40] janjongboom: if your files are in the same package, just use relative paths to reference them
[13:41] MartinCleaver: this is a js library, pre-node. I'm not sure that will work…. checking now.
[13:41] MartinCleaver:  (I'd like to not mess with the code in the library too much, so I was wondering if I can make node fulfill this module's path dependencies using changes at the top of the library)
[13:42] janjongboom: you'll have to change the code a bit to let it work with the CommonJS system

[13:46] MartinCleaver: https://github.com/mrjcleaver/freshbooks-javascript-library/blob/master/library/FreshBooks/TimeEntry.js
[13:46] janjongboom: you'll have to do a `var Element = require("./Element")` in that file

[13:47] nicki9knuckles has left the channel

[13:52] janjongboom: forget about package.json for this @MartinCleaver

[16:03] tuhoojabotti: it should be
[16:04] tuhoojabotti: I even tried *
[16:04] slickplaid: Express 3.x (master branch) is compatible with node 0.6.x and connect 2.x
[16:04] slickplaid: have you updated connect as well?
[16:04] alvaro_o has joined the channel

[16:04] bkaney_ has joined the channel
[16:05] tuhoojabotti: I knew something was wrong when I got the error that sys doesn't exist anymore :D
[16:05] slickplaid: I usually do "express": "3.x.x" to make sure it doesn't jump to a newer, possibly breaking version
[16:05] slickplaid: hehe
[16:05] tuhoojabotti: yeah
[16:06] tuhoojabotti: is the package name "express"
[16:06] tuhoojabotti: or expressjs
[16:06] tuhoojabotti: because npm can't find express version higher than 1.0.7
[16:06] tuhoojabotti: which is weird
[16:07] tuhoojabotti: nope
[16:07] tuhoojabotti: it's ok
[16:07] tuhoojabotti: hmm
[16:07] tuhoojabotti: could be npm cache..
[16:08] tuhoojabotti: nope
[16:09] gsmcwhirter: tuhoojabotti: version of node?
[16:09] slickplaid: http://search.npmjs.org/#/express
[16:10] bradleymeck has joined the channel
[16:10] tuhoojabotti: slickplaid: Yeah, but mine won't even find newer than 1.0.7
[16:10] tuhoojabotti: gsmcwhirter: 0.7.x
[16:10] tuhoojabotti: but I have 0.6.6 too
[16:10] gsmcwhirter: tuhoojabotti: npm is probably using the 0.7.x and express specifies engine < 0.7.0
[16:10] gsmcwhirter: probably since 1.0.7 + 1
[16:11] tuhoojabotti: yeah
[16:11] gsmcwhirter: yeah. 1.0.7 just says >= 0.2.0 for engine, so that is the last compatible build it is finding
[16:11] tuhoojabotti: could be
[16:11] apcshields has joined the channel
[16:12] tuhoojabotti: I'll switch to 0.6.6

[17:43] AvianFlu: AndreasMadsen, what are you seeing? is it just not staying alive?
[17:44] AndreasMadsen: AvianFlu: I have 3 processes. Daemon, pump and child
[17:44] AndreasMadsen: When I kill daemon this function execute: https://github.com/AndreasMadsen/immortal/blob/refactor/lib/executables/pump.js#L63L78
[17:45] metavers_ has joined the channel
[17:45] AndreasMadsen: ^ and that is confirmed by logging to a file

[17:45] AndreasMadsen: ^ sure the child dies too
[17:45] wamberg has joined the channel
[17:45] AvianFlu: okay, so, the parent dies, and the child dies with it
[17:46] AvianFlu: that makes sense, since I don't think you're actually detached there
[17:46] AndreasMadsen: AvianFlu: no, if I outcomment child.kill()
[17:46] AndreasMadsen: the pump is still alive
[17:46] AndreasMadsen: and child.kill() should kill the child process, not the pump process (the script itself)
[17:47] tjholowaychuk has joined the channel
[17:48] closure000_ has joined the channel
[17:48] AndreasMadsen: AvianFlu: so it isn't because I have deatached wrong, something is just happening when I call child.kill(), and it can't be logged by process.on('uncaughtexception').'

[17:49] AvianFlu: AndreasMadsen, I see what you're saying

[22:00] joshgillies has joined the channel
[22:00] dtrejo: can you code something up and try it?
[22:00] ningu: is there much communication between the node devs and the v8 folks?
[22:00] mandric has joined the channel
[22:00] thinkjson: I guess there's only one way to find out :)
[22:01] thinkjson: ningu: sure
[22:01] dtrejo: ningu: I think there's a decent amount?
[22:01] ningu: just curious, cause node's needs must differ from various other users of v8, they might have special requests
[22:01] thinkjson: dtrejo: have you written a .node module before? it's not exactly trivial. I'll git er done, though. :(
[22:01] thinkjson: s/(/)/

[22:02] thinkjson: I want to expose one of the STL data structures
[22:02] graeme_f: but the c++ bits would have to be compiled to 64bit wouldn't they?

[22:04] Alex____: so I have to implement it by my self then

[22:06] joshgillies has joined the channel
[22:06] joshfinnie has joined the channel

[22:08] h4mz1d has joined the channel
[22:09] isaacs: Alex____: that's why nvm has to be put in your .bashrc, not just run as a script.
[22:09] Alex____: I understand we can only change process env, but just wondering is there a way to hack the shell environment
[22:10] isaacs: Alex____: whereas nave starts a subshell, so it doesn't have to update the current env.
[22:10] isaacs: Alex____: check out how nave does it.
[22:10] isaacs: Alex____: you just set the environment in a *child* shell, and then run your program in there.

[22:11] ts__: is there a way to override a builtin module ? for example i want to test some code by using a mock of the fs module ?
[22:11] isaacs: ts__: no, there is not.
[22:11] Alex____: Thanks everyone for the help
[22:12] fmeyer has joined the channel
[22:12] ts__: isaacs: i suppose its not a good idea to mess with the module cache ?
[22:12] isaacs: ts__: you can do something like require(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'testing' ? './my-fs.js' : 'fs')
[22:12] traph has joined the channel
[22:12] isaacs: ts__: not a great idea, no, but it is an option.  tread carefully :)

[22:21] Phoenixz: nathanielk: CORS? Dont know it.. googling..
[22:21] nathanielk: ie, have a server serve the PHP and set CORS appropriately
[22:21] nathanielk: i don't know if that would work but i've done it to hit different ports with ajax from a given page
[22:21] Phoenixz: nathanielk: Im sorry, now I am at a loss... What is CORS exactly? a node module?

[22:43] isaacs: megalomix: you should make sure before you call it, though :)

[22:49] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: quick question. I have something like "main": "./lib/mocha", but have ./lib-cov instrumented, and throughout the tests require('../') what would you recommend to make that work?
[22:49] graeme_f: also it's not mentioned on the website as far as i could see :)
[22:49] tjholowaychuk: I used to use require.paths for that but maybe some NODE_PATH trickery could do it
[22:50] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: ew.
[22:50] isaacs: why not just have a shim that requires the instrumented thing if it's in test-mode?
[22:50] isaacs: instrumented-mode, i mean
[22:50] al3xnull has joined the channel
[22:50] SubStack: instruments!
[22:51] isaacs: if (process.env.PLAY_ALL_COVERAGE_INSTRUMENTS) { return module.exports = require('../lib-cov/mocha') }
[22:51] Bonuspunkt: isaacs about the fuzzy versioning thing, why not drop versioning completly and force ppl to do NPM TEST :)
[22:51] TooTallNate: tjholowaychuk: setting NODE_PATH should work though too, but then you'd probably change all the requires to require('mocha')
[22:51] tjholowaychuk: yeah i guess
[22:51] tjholowaychuk: kinda lame
[22:51] whaley has joined the channel
[22:51] tjholowaychuk: TooTallNate tried that
[22:51] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: better to do this the simple easy way.
[22:52] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: i mean, if you can do it in one line, even one ugly line, that's better than a big ugly hack somewhere else, just to have one cleaner-line
[22:52] FuzzYspo0N: tjholowaychuk, where can i render this json stuff from dox (using jade or similar?)
[22:52] tjholowaychuk: FuzzYspo0N: anything
[22:52] FuzzYspo0N: tjholowaychuk, i mean 'to html converting' without me manually coding it?
[22:52] tjholowaychuk: isaacs something less obtrusive would be nice but it will do
[22:53] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: you could just have a main file that does nothing else.
[22:53] Tobsn has joined the channel
[22:54] tjholowaychuk: isaacs: yeah that's what I'll do. It was just kinda nice the old way since you could use it with any lib untouched
[22:54] tjholowaychuk: not a huge deal
[22:54] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: ie, mocha/main.js would do module.exports=require(doCoverage ? './lib-cov/mocha.js' : './lib/mocha.js')
[22:54] isaacs: or something
[22:55] isaacs: tjholowaychuk: the way to do this cleverly would be to hijack the require.extensions[".js"] to check for a covered version of the script being loaded.
[22:55] isaacs: but still, you have to explicitly do that *somewhere*
[22:55] isaacs: ie, rather that /lib-cov/mocha.js you'd have perhaps coverage/lib/mocha.js, and prepend that bit if it's in covered mode.
[22:56] graeme_f has joined the channel
[22:56] tjholowaychuk: the ternary is a good excuse to keep all my ./index.js files intead of using "main"
[22:56] tjholowaychuk: haha

[23:58] cconstantine_: I keep seeing it all over the place and ->\n\t is way shorter than function
[23:58] cconstantine_: also it does inheritance?
[23:58] tjholowaychuk: cconstantine_ if you type "function" you're doing it wrong :p
[23:58] tjholowaychuk: utilize them editors!
[23:58] cconstantine_: -_-
[23:58] cconstantine_: editors shouldn't be making up for language warts :P
[23:59] iangreen_: cconstantine_: IMO it depends on to what degree working in Javascript grates on your patience.
[23:59] tjholowaychuk: sure, but typing should not be a programmers bottleneck
[23:59] tjholowaychuk: it never really is
[23:59] cconstantine_: agreed
[23:59] Druid_ has joined the channel
[23:59] jl_hki has joined the channel
