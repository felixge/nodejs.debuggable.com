[00:46] Crshman: hey all, so I have a server daemon running and all is right in the world....but I want to write a cli interface to grab/set parameters for that running daemon
[00:46] tbranyen: in which you could do key in obj
[00:46] Crshman: what's the best way to go about that?

[00:53] temp02 has joined the channel
[00:54] tprice: whats best practice when it comes to it is what im asking.

[00:55] misterm: tprice: 
[00:55] AaronMT has joined the channel
[00:55] misterm: "in" just checks for the existence of the key...it could be a prototype property, hasOwnProperty check's, as you might imagine, only own properties
[00:56] misterm: doing obj[propname] is useful if you need to check the actual value
[00:57] misterm: I'd also note that the former check for the actual existence of the property, while the last doesn't

[03:48] isaacs: SubStack: i need this for npm.
[03:48] SubStack: yes sir
[03:48] isaacs: SubStack: i want to have every download managed with a nice little stack of progress bars.
[03:48] SubStack: isaacs: turns out, ansi codes are wicked simple

[03:48] isaacs: SubStack: yeah
[03:48] SubStack: and the problem that ncurses solves doesn't really exist anymore

[03:49] SubStack: since ansi won like 20 years ago
[03:49] AvianFlu_: 2011 ftw
[03:49] isaacs: Guest18468: sure.  just install node in a place that isn't root-owned (like ~/local or something) or specifically set that as your `prefix` config in ~/.npmrc
[03:49] isaacs: Guest18468: npm help config, search for "prefix"
[03:49] SubStack: 25 years ago really
[03:49] SubStack: once BBSes took off
[03:50] Ned_: isaacs: yeah, the prefix is the bit I was failing at I think
[03:50] isaacs: SubStack: does ncurses support Windows?
[03:50] SubStack: no idea
[03:50] isaacs: SubStack: i think the windows cli is not ansi

[03:54] mscdex: SubStack: how far are you planning on expanding this module?
[03:55] SubStack: mscdex: not very far, only enough to do what I need it to do
[03:55] mscdex: SubStack: i might write a windowing layer for it
[03:55] mscdex: :-D
[03:55] SubStack: yeah that would be cool
[03:55] SubStack: as a separate module using charm would be a good way to do it
[03:55] SubStack: lots of ways to do windowing
[03:56] mscdex: yeah ideally i'd like to have a shim over node-charm to match the node-ncurses api
[03:56] SubStack: basic ansi is really simple, it only took me a few hours to get everything working
[03:56] SubStack: that would be nifty
[03:57] MUILTFN has joined the channel
[03:58] mscdex: someone contacted me today about getting their node-ncurses-based game over tcp and since ncurses only deals directly with terminals, having a compatible api for something that can do the same thing over the network would be awesome
[03:58] AvianFlu_: that would be pretty sweet
[03:58] SubStack: just require('charm')(stream)
[03:59] SubStack: works with http even
[03:59] SubStack: the response object
[03:59] mscdex: yeah

[04:46] tylergillies_: its ironic that javascript object notation you need " around everything, yet in javascript, to make an object you can do {foo:"bar"}
[04:46] zilch has joined the channel
[04:46] progrock: hmm, so whats the defense to the old "you can't extensively automate testing of a program made in a dynamic typed, mutable, non compiledd language as compared to static typed, non mutable, compiled langauge?"
[04:46] SubStack: why is that ironic?
[04:46] progrock: just asking since my coworkers are all scala developers, while I'm the front end javascript developer
[04:46] tylergillies_: because it gets its name from javascript, but in javascript you don't have to do that, hence, irony
[04:47] SubStack: but you can do that in javascript
[04:47] SubStack: in fact you must for some keys like "function"
[04:47] SubStack: or anything with spaces
[04:47] tylergillies_: yeah, but you don't have to, whereas in json you do
[04:47] aho: the quotes were made mandatory to make it simpler
[04:47] SubStack: or any other sort of punctuation
[04:47] progrock: tylergillies_: in fact, I think peoples usually conside it good standard to put quotes around keys
[04:47] aho: (reserved words)
[04:47] tylergillies_: im not saying its wrong
[04:47] tylergillies_: im just saying there is some irony
[04:47] SubStack: special cases for barewords aren't a very good thing to bake into a data exchange format
[04:48] newy has joined the channel
[04:48] mundanity has joined the channel
[04:48] SubStack: it's just a subset of javascript
[04:48] tylergillies_: irony == good imho
[04:48] SubStack: makes sense to me
[04:48] progrock: tylergillies_: again, not really.. JSON is not just for javascript... definitely easier for it to be universally used usin the quotes
[04:49] aho: iirc es5 (5.1?) actually fixed that
[04:49] aho: you can use reserved words w/o quotes there
[04:50] tylergillies_: regardless of if its used solely for javascript or not, its ironic. http://chzb.gr/bSj5xt
[04:51] progrock: ehh, i dont find it to be
[04:51] progrock: in javascript you can define functions, in json you cant... thats not ironic to me either... it makes complete sense
[04:52] progrock: a javascript object and a json object are 2 different data types
[04:52] tbranyen: well unless you do what couch does, and stores them as strings
[04:52] tbranyen: but yeah they are still strings, not functions
[04:52] progrock: exactly
[04:52] devrim has joined the channel
[04:52] progrock: but again, makes sense, lol.. wold be fucking retarded if they tried to make some universal way to define code in json
[04:53] progrock: lol... way beyond the 1 paragraph explanation of everything in JSON
[04:53] devrim: does anyone point me to a good html encoder for nodes ?
[04:53] devrim: *nodejs
[04:53] tylergillies_: how does something being ironic automatically mean it doesn't make sense?
[04:53] devrim: *can
[04:54] AAA_awright: tbranyen: Ironic implies a reverse of what you expected... JSON is just a subset of Javascript, {"foo":"bar"} is perfectly a valid Javascript expression

[04:55] tbranyen: AAA_awright: why you telling me that?

[04:56] AAA_awright: hmm
[04:56] progrock: on the otherhand tylergillies_ , yeah, ironic tings are more oe less usually opposites combined.. or close to... thatsnot even close
[04:57] tylergillies_: opposites combined i would more attribute to the word "oxymoron"
[04:57] tylergillies_: (which literally means sharp/dull)
[04:57] progrock: Noun: The expression of one's meaning by using language that normally signifies the opposite, typically for humorous or emphatic effect.
[04:58] progrock: I guess combinednot the right wording

[11:41] jakehow has joined the channel
[11:42] damiano: yes
[11:42] damiano: exactly
[11:42] damiano: this /login page is called from a FORM
[11:43] damiano: <form action='/login' method='post'>
[11:43] damiano: only to check if the user exists
[11:43] blueadept: the way i notify improper logins is within my User.authenticate function i have an if else, where if the user goes though, i set the session and redirect, if it fails, i render a specific page which also passes req.flash that shows up with the message "login failed"
[11:44] blueadept: so that's one way of doing it
[11:44] blueadept: actually i dont pass req.flash, i just set it
[11:45] simenbrekken has joined the channel
[11:46] simenbrekken has joined the channel
[11:46] damiano: yes
[11:46] damiano: i redirect if the login is ok

[11:46] Bogh has joined the channel
[11:46] damiano: res.render('index')
[11:47] blueadept: right
[11:47] damiano: i will have the same page at / and /login
[11:47] damiano: it's not very good
[11:47] damiano: i would like to render a page in that, i mean: 1. redirect 2. render the page automatically
[11:47] blueadept: well the key is to make sure you set req.flash to req.flash('warn', 'Login Failed')
[11:48] simenbrekken has joined the channel
[11:48] blueadept: and on the page you render, set up a  - if (flash.warn)   p#warn = flash.warn
[11:48] damiano: wiat
[11:48] damiano: quat req.flash does ?
[11:48] damiano: what
[11:48] blueadept: it will handle the message you want to preset on that page
[11:49] damiano: write the text on a cookie ?

[11:55] damiano: blueadept, res.render('sessions/new', {redir: req.body.redir})   it rend the page
[11:55] damiano: what is the redir:

[11:57] blueadept: hm, perhaps i dont need that in there, but i think it has something to do with redirected pages
[11:57] blueadept: you can ignore that i think
[11:57] damiano: hmmm...as far i have understand
[11:58] damiano: you have the message with .flash
[11:58] damiano: and then render the page..
[11:58] damiano: but if you render the page there you are in /sessions
[11:58] damiano: is the wrong page
[11:58] damiano: so i think that "redir:" it mean that it has to render the page and make a redirect 301
[11:58] damiano: automatically
[11:58] damiano: no?
[11:59] blueadept: ha i honestly forget 
[11:59] blueadept: i think it might be there by mistake
[11:59] damiano: k
[11:59] blueadept: i think it's an artifact
[12:00] blueadept: dont mind that
[12:00] damiano: but in this case
[12:00] damiano: you render the page
[12:00] damiano: on /session
[12:00] spencertheman has left the channel
[12:00] damiano: so why use .flash() ?
[12:00] damiano: you just can do
[12:00] damiano: res.render('sesssion', {error: 'Wrong login'});
[12:00] blueadept: yep
[12:00] damiano: why did you use flash() ?
[12:01] blueadept: i think it was just a way of organizing it
[12:01] blueadept: you could also do err: 'msg'
[12:01] damiano: ok, but to resolve my problem, how could i show a message to render in a different page ?
[12:01] damiano: y
[12:02] blueadept: what message are you trying to specifically show and on what pages?
[12:02] zilch has joined the channel
[12:03] damiano: "access denied"
[12:03] damiano: or
[12:03] damiano: "email and password are not correct"
[12:03] damiano: messages like those
[12:03] blueadept: well email and password are not correctly only needs to render on which ever page you render on a false login
[12:03] blueadept: for access denied
[12:04] blueadept: that's something different 
[12:04] blueadept: let me look at something
[12:04] blueadept: ok yeah, you want to pass in a function into all app.get arguments
[12:04] blueadept: that checks the session
[12:05] saschagehlich has joined the channel
[12:05] damiano: example.com?error=text
[12:05] damiano: ?
[12:05] damiano: hmmm
[12:05] damiano: i don't like it
[12:05] damiano: the problem is that i don't hav e alogin page
[12:05] damiano: i have a form on index
[12:05] zilch has joined the channel
[12:05] damiano: with action='/login'
[12:05] blueadept: http://pastie.org/private/xdga78ybt2lvyrpq2fbcw
[12:05] blueadept: you want something like this
[12:06] damiano: i see
[12:06] blueadept: where you have an anon function that checks the session, and either continues forward, or stops the request and redirects to a new page 
[12:06] damiano: yes
[12:06] damiano: i have that function
[12:06] damiano: but
[12:06] damiano: that function only check if the session ahs been created
[12:06] damiano: and stop
[12:07] damiano: i need to print an error
[12:07] damiano: if the user write wrong credentials
[12:07] damiano: so, this middleware to check if it is logged, 
[12:07] damiano: yes i have it
[12:07] damiano: but BEFORE it
[12:07] damiano: i have to show to the user if the login gone well
[12:07] blueadept: why so?
[12:08] damiano: ?
[12:08] blueadept: if they login, then they login and they see a page which indicates they are logged in, if they can't login, they see a page which indicates the reason for their login failure
[12:08] damiano: i have
[12:08] damiano: yes
[12:08] damiano: you are right
[12:08] blueadept: if they aren't logged in, they get redirected to a page indicated they arne't logged in
[12:08] damiano: i think we are telling the same things
[12:08] damiano: :D
[12:08] damiano: but
[12:08] blueadept: ha
[12:08] damiano: there is one problem
[12:08] metaverse has joined the channel
[12:09] damiano: becuase when you say :"a page which indicates the reason for their login failure"
[12:09] damiano: this page has to be the index
[12:09] damiano: becase there the user see the previos email/password
[12:09] damiano: change it
[12:09] damiano: and do the login again
[12:09] blueadept: ok, so res.render('index', error: 'login failure') right?
[12:09] damiano: i don't want to show a page with an error...because
[12:10] ts__ has joined the channel
[12:10] blueadept: and in the index do a - if (error) p#error= error
[12:10] zilch has joined the channel
[12:10] damiano: if i do that...the login, has to move to the home page again, write the login again...and then press the login button
[12:10] damiano: yes
[12:10] damiano: exactly
[12:10] damiano:  res.render('index', error: 'login failure') <------
[12:10] damiano: yes
[12:10] blueadept: yeah that works
[12:10] damiano: but if i do that...it renders the page at
[12:10] damiano:  /login
[12:11] damiano: example.com/login
[12:11] damiano: so example.com and exmaple.com/login
[12:11] blueadept: so when any users goes to example.com/ it automatically goes to example.com/login ?
[12:11] damiano: are the same because i render the same view
[12:11] blueadept: oh
[12:11] blueadept: i'd split the views up
[12:11] damiano: no no
[12:11] damiano: there is
[12:11] damiano: example.com
[12:11] damiano: with a form that has the action to '/login'
[12:11] simenbrekken has joined the channel
[12:12] blueadept: ok
[12:12] damiano: this 'login' is not a page...it only check if the credentials are good or not
[12:12] damiano: and then redirect the user if are good
[12:12] blueadept: i'm confused :/
[12:12] zilch has joined the channel
[12:12] damiano: or show a message if not... but this message has to be on the index page not /login
[12:12] damiano: maybe my fucking english :D
[12:13] blueadept: where you from?
[12:13] damiano: italy
[12:13] damiano: u?
[12:13] blueadept: us
[12:13] blueadept: cool, no your english is good, i think your issue is just oragnizing how you want this all to be setup
[12:13] blueadept: keep hacking at it 
[12:14] damiano: blueadept, the problem (i think) that i can check the form on the same page
[12:14] damiano: no ?
[12:14] damiano: <form action='' method='post'>
[12:14] damiano: i created a /login page only to check the POST requests
[12:16] blueadept: so you want the form to check the details and not reder or redirect, but show if the message worked or not on the /login page?
[12:17] blueadept: that would take some ajax code
[12:17] damiano: blueadept, good idea
[12:17] blueadept: i use something called nowjs to handle that sort of stuff
[12:17] damiano: i can check the credentials with ajax
[12:18] cying has joined the channel
[12:18] damiano: but if i check email/password using ajax, then, can i do a redirect if are good?
[12:18] blueadept: yeah
[12:18] zilch has joined the channel
[12:18] LazyLucy has joined the channel
[12:18] damiano: hmm interesting
[12:18] blueadept: actually i want to do something like wehat you're talking about
[12:19] damiano: nowjs use socket.io if i'm not wrong
[12:19] blueadept: i just haven't had time to fool around, what i have setup now works
[12:19] blueadept: yes
[12:19] Bogh has joined the channel
[12:19] damiano: i think we could just send an ajax request with jquery
[12:19] damiano: without open socket
[12:19] damiano: no?
[12:19] blueadept: right
[12:19] blueadept: yeah
[12:19] damiano: k
[12:20] blueadept: i'm starting to move all mystuff to nowjs anyway
[12:20] blueadept: but it could work either way
[12:20] simenbrekken has joined the channel
[12:20] damiano: why not socket.io directly?
[12:20] blueadept: less verbose
[12:21] damiano: k
[12:22] damiano: blueadept, maybe a bit slower then socket.io ?
[12:22] blueadept: i haven't really looked at any benchmarks, but if there is any difference, i can't tell
[12:23] damiano: k
[12:23] damiano: maybe we are talking about 1 ms :-D
[12:23] damiano: ahahah
[12:24] damiano: no difference
[12:24] blueadept: yeah it has to be very minute
[12:24] blueadept: if not at all
[12:24] bogdan_ has joined the channel

[13:11] zilch has joined the channel
[13:11] nodokodo: it doesnt
[13:11] nodokodo: connections are proxied to backends
[13:12] nodokodo: same thing
[13:12] nodokodo: why cant you do any of the above?
[13:12] vdemedes: nodokodo: when you run `rails s` it runs Rails app and server

[13:13] nodokodo: so whats your point?
[13:13] vdemedes: ok, I got it
[13:14] nodokodo: theres nothing stopping you running ANYTHING on 80 except beinbg a non-privilged user
[13:14] vdemedes: yeah, I know

[19:07] tjholowaychuk: pr2012 if it's x-www-form-urlencoded or application/json you can use bodyParser
[19:07] tjholowaychuk: otherwise you can stream/do whatever you want with the data events
[19:07] goshakkk: TheJH, can web app be fully writen in node?
[19:07] ashu has joined the channel
[19:08] pr2012: yeah, bodyParser is missing it. 
[19:08] MUILTFN has joined the channel
[19:08] tjholowaychuk: is it one of those content-types?
[19:08] TheJH: goshakkk, I think so

[19:10] booo has joined the channel
[19:10] TheJH: goshakkk, but I don't think that there are huge disadvantages
[19:10] goshakkk: TheJH, can you give some examples when node is better and when it's not good to use node please?
[19:11] zilch has joined the channel
[19:11] tjholowaychuk: pr2012 figure it out?
[19:11] pr2012: Possibly some groovy restclient weirdness. Gonna debug the other side.
[19:11] tjholowaychuk: check the header fields
[19:12] tjholowaychuk: may not be giving you Content-Type: application/json etc
[19:12] vikstrous has joined the channel
[19:12] TheJH: goshakkk, I think that a usecase where node is good would be a webchat or so. Any rails fans here? I don't feel comfortable advertising rails stuff here as I don't even know anything about it
[19:12] pr2012: probably it. I don't think it sets the content-type by default.
[19:12] tjholowaychuk: ah
[19:12] tjholowaychuk: that would be it
[19:13] raidfive has joined the channel
[19:13] goshakkk: TheJH, rails is the usual web framework
[19:13] goshakkk: written in perfect language Ruby ;)
[19:13] S1r10n: isaacs ... what now? which node-waf --> /root/local/node/bin/node-waf which python --> /usr/bin/python ... wile ~ is /root it works without the -g option any solution?
[19:14] TheJH: goshakkk, I know that it's the usual web framework for ruby, but not much more
[19:14] tjholowaychuk: lololool
[19:14] goshakkk: TheJH, it's perversely to write simple blog engine in node, right?
[19:14] TheJH: goshakkk, btw, I think that ryah says he decided to create nodejs just because ruby was too slow
[19:14] isaacs: S1r10n: wha'ts your $PATH environment variable?
[19:15] Drakonite has joined the channel
[19:15] isaacs: S1r10n: also, are you logged in as root?  or using sudo?
[19:15] TheJH: goshakkk, no, I don't think so. isaacs, your blog is written in node, right?
[19:15] isaacs: TheJH: no, my blog is tumblr
[19:15] TheJH: ah, sorry
[19:15] isaacs: TheJH: so it's written on clouds and marshmallows and downtime :)
[19:15] S1r10n:  $PATH --> -bash: /root/local/node/bin:/root/local/node/bin:/root/local/node/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin: No such file or directory 
[19:16] S1r10n: logged in as root (is a testing server only root exists)
[19:16] isaacs: S1r10n: to check an environment variable, you can do `echo $PATH`
[19:16] goshakkk: TheJH, yeah ruby is a bit slow, but 1.9.3-preview1 doubled performance of rails bootstraping
[19:16] S1r10n: echo $PATH --> /root/local/node/bin:/root/local/node/bin:/root/local/node/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
[19:17] S1r10n: isaacs: echo $PATH --> /root/local/node/bin:/root/local/node/bin:/root/local/node/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin

[19:19] S1r10n: isaacs: it is in there and it works when I install daemon without the -g flag
[19:19] isaacs: S1r10n: this is confusing to me.
[19:20] S1r10n: isaacs: well to me too I switched too stable (node) extra to test if it was a problem of my setup but the problem remained
[19:21] isaacs: yeah, thisis some kind of weird path resolution thing.

[19:46] supjeff: spawn
[19:46] supjeff: should I use exec?
[19:46] AvianFlu: no, you should use spawn if you want the streams
[19:46] AvianFlu: what's the child?

[19:58] AvianFlu: I'm not familiar with express or jade very much, but I'd definitely make my first guess the other templating engine in the picture
[19:59] AvianFlu: i.e. jade
[19:59] jeromegn: chapel: I mean, exec returns a big stdout as one of the callback args, but spawn lets you listen in on the stdout event which may be fire more than once
[19:59] AvianFlu: jeromegn: it's not 'one big stdout', it's all the program's output, buffered
[19:59] AvianFlu: spawn gives you access to the streams, which lets you deal with the data in real-time afterwards
[20:00] AvianFlu: instead of afterwards, I mean
[20:00] chapel: ah jeromegn I don't care about the stdout, just that it completes

[22:41] metaverse: tjholowaychuk: hmm, that object is empty. But I guess I can just add my variables in object and reference that instead. Thanks though! :)
[22:41] zilch has joined the channel
[22:41] tjholowaychuk: metaverse yeah I personally wouldn't rely on "this" being anything significant

[23:06] kilian_: i'am reading here http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.10/api/net.html#server.listen but i can't figure out the host parameter, the server still accepts all connections, is there a way to grab the host of a incoming tcp connection?

[23:09] TheJH: kilian_, did you specify "127.0.0.1" as host?
[23:10] kriszyp has joined the channel
[23:10] kilian_: TheJH i specified a domain, i want a per host switch, is it possible to do with tcp ?
[23:10] secoif has joined the channel
[23:11] TheJH: kilian_, only with a per-ip switch, not with a per-hostname switch
[23:12] kilian_: so i can't bind hosts, but interfaces instead
[23:12] kilian_: or local / external
[23:14] TheJH: kilian_, you can have multiple IPs per interface
[23:14] kilian_: i know
