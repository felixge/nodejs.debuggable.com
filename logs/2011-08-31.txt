[00:26] dscape: guys if you wanted to export different functions according to a system call in node how would you do it?
[00:26] dscape: e.g. `whoami`
[00:27] dscape: if local_user then local function gets exported
[00:27] dscape: else production function gets exported
[00:28] dscape: anyone? :)
[00:29] sstephenson_: use process.env.USER instead
[00:30] a_suenami has joined the channel
[00:30] dscape: sstephenson: that works! :)
[00:30] dscape: still doesn't answer the question, which I would like to know how it could be done
[00:31] dscape: cause it looks to me like it can't?
[00:31] sstephenson: you can't, really - require() is synchronous, spawn() is async
[00:31] DTrejo: if statement with one export in one, and another in the other?
[00:31] bengrue has joined the channel
[00:31] schwab has joined the channel
[00:31] dscape: sstephenson: that's what I was suspecting
[00:31] DTrejo: dscape: when they first call the function, you decide which to use, and cache it
[00:31] sstephenson: you can modify exports asynchronously, but there'd be no way to be notified in client code
[00:31] DTrejo: can be async that way
[00:32] dscape: hey DTrejo :) How are you doing buddy?
[00:32] DTrejo: dscape: doing well :)
[00:32] DTrejo: dscape: make sure to check out my entry: http://hollaback.no.de/
[00:32] dscape: long time since the bbq ;)
[00:32] abravo has joined the channel
[00:32] DTrejo: it tests all npm modules
[00:32] DTrejo: yes, long time
[00:32] DTrejo: still traveling all the time?
[00:32] DTrejo: (school starts for me next week eheh)
[00:32] dscape: nah, more settled. back from edinburgh last week though :)
[00:33] isaacs: DTrejo: http://hollaback.no.de/modules/#semver
[00:33] DTrejo: hmm
[00:34] DTrejo: will rerun some of those tests/look into it
[00:34] isaacs: however:
[00:34] isaacs: ok semver.js .................... 686/686
[00:34] SubStack: DTrejo: what does hollaback use to run the tests?
[00:36] DTrejo: SubStack: it uses the command listed in package.json scripts.test property
[00:36] AvianFlu has joined the channel
[00:36] SubStack: DTrejo: https://github.com/dominictarr/meta-test
[00:37] SubStack: can figure out pretty well which test harness is being used without a scripts.test
[00:37] isaacs: SubStack: but there's no need, since they're just doing pass/fail
[00:37] isaacs: either it exits 0, or it doesn't
[00:37] SubStack: oh
[00:37] DTrejo: we also have handlers for vows and other popular frameworks
[00:37] DTrejo: that parse their output
[00:37] DTrejo: vows has json
[00:38] DTrejo: and so does expresso, i think
[00:38] MrNko has joined the channel
[00:38] tjholowaychuk: something unified like TAP would be better
[00:38] isaacs: yeeessss
[00:38] isaacs: taaaapp!
[00:38] dscape: DTrejo: how can I add my modules to it? :)
[00:38] SubStack: tap tap tap
[00:39] MrNko has joined the channel
[00:39] dimroc has joined the channel
[00:39] DTrejo: dscape: they are auto added when you publish to npm
[00:39] tjholowaychuk: pat pat pat
[00:39] DTrejo: tjholowaychuk: i agree
[00:39] DTrejo: we parse tap
[00:39] DTrejo: when it is outputted
[00:39] DTrejo: if we know that it is tap, that is
[00:39] isaacs: DTrejo: i think indexzero was going to make vows output tap if TAP=1 is in the env
[00:39] dscape: I'm guessing I need to put some kind of info in the package.json file?
[00:39] dscape: you are probably not going to read the readme file I added to the test/ directory ;)
[00:39] isaacs: dscape: { "scripts": { "test": "do some stuff" }}
[00:39] DTrejo: isaacs: that would be great, then we could find out more than just pass fail: # passed tests, etc
[00:40] isaacs: dscape: that also enables the `npm test` command
[00:40] dscape: cool, thanks isaacs . and hello to you too sir :)
[00:40] DTrejo: dscape: and if you use expresso or vows, it will work. also tap works
[00:40] isaacs: hello :)
[00:40] dscape: lets try that out
[00:40] DTrejo: I will make a test of supported modules
[00:40] tjholowaychuk: if you supported make test
[00:40] isaacs: dscape: also, you should make your test framework a devDependency
[00:40] tjholowaychuk: that would be nice too
[00:40] DTrejo: also the testing can take a bit, so yea
[00:40] hankejh has joined the channel
[00:40] blueadept` has joined the channel
[00:40] DTrejo: tjholowaychuk: we would, if it exited with 0 or 1 exit code
[00:41] tjholowaychuk: it does
[00:41] DTrejo: oh 
[00:41] DTrejo: in that case it already supports it
[00:41] DTrejo: :)
[00:41] tjholowaychuk: the test framework just needs to exit(failures)
[00:41] robi42 has joined the channel
[00:42] DTrejo: we fall back to exit codes if its not vows or expresso
[00:42] isaacs: DTrejo: there's modules on npm for parsing tap, and generating it
[00:42] abustin has joined the channel
[00:42] DTrejo: here is full list of supported frameworks: expresso.js     jasmine-node.js tap.js          whiskey.js
[00:42] DTrejo: generic.js      nodeunit.js     vows.js
[00:42] DTrejo: isaacs: I think we use those

[00:42] sridatta has joined the channel
[00:42] jokil has joined the channel
[00:43] Nuck has joined the channel
[00:43] DTrejo: although I think tap does exit codes correctly

[00:43] DTrejo: and give more info on the /modules/#semver page, etc
[00:44] DTrejo: btw guys: vote for us! http://hollaback.no.de :)

[00:49] dscape: DTrejo: what if my tests require you to have a couchdb in adminparty mode in localhost ? :P
[00:49] dscape: any way for me to snif hey this is your machine and change it to run against iris couch or something?
[00:49] DTrejo: then they will fail eheh
[00:49] dscape: i can change it to iris couch
[00:49] DTrejo: dscape: yea, that should work
[00:49] dscape: just dont want to do it for everyone downloading
[00:49] DTrejo: yea
[00:49] dscape: what's ur username on the machine?
[00:50] dscape: or something I can detect
[00:50] DTrejo: ummm, at the moment we don't tell scripts anything special that they are being used
[00:50] dscape: you have process.env
[00:50] dscape: so if its in env it should be fine?
[00:50] DTrejo: we run it on multiple machines
[00:50] DTrejo: linux, solaris, mac, etc
[00:50] captain_morgan: dscape: yes, that is the case
[00:50] DTrejo: I will write this down, as we need to solve this issue
[00:50] captain_morgan: we do process ANY=THING before the command
[00:50] DTrejo: (once we are allowed to edit code again)
[00:51] dscape: DTrejo: I'll commit to github as localhost
[00:51] dscape: and commit to npm as iris couch
[00:51] eyesUnclouded has joined the channel
[00:51] captain_morgan: and add it to the spawn({env:{any:'thing'})
[00:51] dscape: cause i dont expect people to test the npm package
[00:51] DTrejo: sounds good
[00:51] DTrejo: we will see if we can work out a better solution after judging ends
[00:51] dscape: real cool project btw
[00:52] dscape: its awesome for anyone maintaing a package

[01:58] dscape: node doc/bulk.js
[01:59] dscape: Nuck: I like it too
[01:59] dscape: and I like using nano to edit the nano source code
[01:59] Nuck: :P

[01:59] Murvin: Nuck: what?
[01:59] te-brian has joined the channel
[01:59] Nuck: Murvin: You used a GET request as "update" >:C
[01:59] dscape: nano is the defacto text editor for small fast changes to package.json
[01:59] Nuck: GET never changes server state
[01:59] Murvin: Nuck:    well, just an example
[02:00] Nuck: Murvin: As far as I know, session only updates when you update session
[02:00] Murvin: Nuck:  ok. how's that.. app.get()  will not create any session, or trigger express.session ...  thus no entry in datastore.   but  only app.post() will create session or update session
[02:01] Nuck: Am I wrong, tjholowaychuk?
[02:01] tjholowaychuk: ?
[02:01] brianseeders has joined the channel
[02:01] Nuck: session
[02:01] Murvin: Nuck:  no.   whenver I call something app.get or app.post..    express.session will run.
[02:01] Nuck: Does it update on each pageload?
[02:01] tjholowaychuk: yes
[02:01] Murvin: Nuck: yes
[02:01] Acolyte: Nuck: any recommendation about avoiding escaping "transclusion"ed templates?
[02:01] tjholowaychuk: we would have to hash the object to see if there are changes etc
[02:01] yokoaway has joined the channel
[02:02] tjholowaychuk: i do plan on making that a bit smarter, and possibly implement a merging strategy
[02:02] tjholowaychuk: but for now it's simply saving the session per request
[02:02] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: Might be a good idea, to cache it locally, but I thought it only grabbed the session if I didn't change the object
[02:02] Murvin: Nuck:  so, is there a way to say only certain Post call will even touch the session..  but not others
[02:02] tjholowaychuk: Nuck that doesnt scale
[02:02] chud has joined the channel
[02:02] JumpMast3r has joined the channel
[02:03] tjholowaychuk: it's not like a GET from redis is slow
[02:03] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: True, but a rotating log is good for caches, as memcached proved
[02:03] bronson has joined the channel
[02:03] Nuck: Murvin: I dunno if you can have middleware for only certain paths
[02:03] tjholowaychuk: sure, as long as you can cap it so you dont bloat the process like mad, and if you flush properly
[02:03] Nuck: That would be cool, though, I must admit.
[02:03] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: Oh, certainly
[02:03] meso_ has joined the channel
[02:03] Nuck: Caching everything in RAM would be a horrible idea
[02:03] tjholowaychuk: wouldn't want to lose that info when the process fails
[02:04] Nuck: Well, just for faster retrieval
[02:04] Murvin: tjholowaychuk:  waht does express.session return?
[02:04] Nuck: Maybe store hashes in RAM and on the store
[02:04] JakeyChan has joined the channel
[02:04] tjholowaychuk: it could definitely be improved
[02:04] tjholowaychuk: in many cases we dont even really need a data store
[02:04] Nuck: It's generally faster to retrieve a single field than to retrieve the whole object
[02:04] Murvin: Can I do this?    session = express.session ();      and app.post('/update', session, function(req, res));
[02:05] tjholowaychuk: but from what i've profiled it's just not a bottleneck so i havent focused on it
[02:05] Murvin: instead of setting the express.sssion in createServer
[02:05] tjholowaychuk: Murvin it returns a function
[02:05] tjholowaychuk: yeah
[02:05] tjholowaychuk: you can do that
[02:05] Murvin: ohohohoho
[02:05] Murvin: thanks.
[02:05] Murvin: let me try it later.
[02:06] Murvin: tahnsk Nuck
[02:06] Nuck: Don't thank me, thank tj ;)
[02:06] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: Well, I'm using it as a shared state between all my servers, so I can't do in-memory stores
[02:07] Nuck: I just toss it into my Mongo server, since that's already shared among all my Nodes.
[02:07] tjholowaychuk: Nuck: for sure, im just saying a lot of cases do cookie -> grab uid with sid -> grab user
[02:07] tjholowaychuk: when it could just be signed cookie -> grab user
[02:07] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: Ah, yeah, I can see that being a common thing
[02:07] Nuck: But what do you mean "signed cookie"?
[02:07] Nuck: Just throw up the user account into the cookie?

[02:35] Ratty_: When nano is the default editor on a server I get confused

[02:36] dscape: seems like couch sets content-type headers with newlines in between the mimetype and permissions
[02:36] dscape: that breaks in node 0.4
[02:36] dscape: but works in 0.5
[02:36] dscape: just try the blog post I wrote about piping
[02:36] JasonSmith: dscape: mimetype and "permissions" -- what permissions?
[02:36] dscape: but with a jpg from your computer
[02:36] dscape: JasonSmith: like 777
[02:37] dscape: fs perms
[02:37] dscape: if you try the pipe example with but from the filesystem

[03:00] jeromegn: yea, it doesn't do much right now. I'm still debating in my mind what to call the method to remove documents from the array (as in, also remove the referenced document)… MongooseArray already uses `remove` so I think I might name it `destroy` (also seems to catch the spirit of what it does better)

[03:07] mikey_p: dscape: well in this case it's not really mapping anything, but it can still provide useful functionality for modeling
[03:08] mikey_p: dscape: provide default values, validation, etc
[03:08] dscape: argh you sound like an old school xml dude
[03:08] jeromegn: dscape: not sure what you mean, but here's why I think: sometimes necessary! you don't want to duplicate (clone) your data as embedded documents all the time. it becomes difficult to manage
[03:08] mikey_p: got I couldn't hate XML more
[03:08] mikey_p: jeromegn: does this use DBrefs?
[03:08] dscape: mikey_p: how bout html?
[03:09] mikey_p: what about it?
[03:09] dscape: also hate it?
[03:09] dscape: i like xml, its awesome 
[03:09] dscape: also like json, its also awesome
[03:09] jeromegn: mikey_p: no. Been reading about it, looks like it's not recommended if the field always contain the same model reference
[03:09] dscape: just different use cases
[03:09] sharkbird has joined the channel
[03:10] jerrysv: um. wait. someone actually likes xml?
[03:10] mikey_p: I like XML when it's used appropriately, I'm just in the middle of a project with another party that abuses XML quite a bit
[03:10] mikey_p: I don't mind making my APIs support XML via RESTful techniques
[03:10] dscape: i dont see much use for xml in the middle of code
[03:10] dscape: unless u are coding in xslt and/or xquery
[03:11] dscape: its good for stuff like html, describing annotated document so to speak
[03:11] dscape: json is much better at stuff like code and apis
[03:11] mikey_p: but this fulfillment/shipping company on this commerce project thinks that an API consists of 1 URL and all you do is post giant XML bodies to it, and figure out what to do with them based on the contents
[03:11] sivy has joined the channel
[03:12] jerrysv: mikey_p: you're in pdx, right? mind if i ask which company you work for?

[03:12] shanebo: hey guys, anyone familiar with http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.11/api/fs.html#fs.ReadStream ?

[03:14] Nuck: watchFile
[03:14] Nuck: IIRC
[03:14] DTrejo: fs.
[03:14] ChrisPartridge: only can watch dir's I thought
[03:14] SubStack: fs.watchFile should return an object that you can .unwatch() on
[03:15] SubStack: and listen for 'changed' events
[03:15] SubStack: hmm
[03:15] dscape: shanebo: http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.5.5/api/fs.html#fs.watchFile
[03:15] Nuck: Yay I had it before SubStack :D
[03:15] shanebo: Nuck +1
[03:15] shanebo: SubStack, what event fires with changes?
[03:15] SubStack: Nuck: I was just responding to you, not to dscape's question
[03:15] SubStack: shanebo: you pass in a callback to fs.watchFile
[03:16] SubStack: and you get 2 stat objects
[03:16] freewil: ChrisPartridge, QBXML wrapped in SOAP
[03:16] SubStack: before and after
[03:16] freewil: awesome
[03:16] SubStack: when the file changes
[03:16] vidi has joined the channel
[03:16] SubStack: but being able to just do fs.watchFile(file).on('delete', fn) would be much nicer I think
[03:17] shanebo: SubStack, "The callback listener will be called each time the file is accessed." that's a bit ambiguous, but I supposed "accessed" means changed?
[03:17] SubStack: oh it already does return an event emitter, nifty!
[03:17] SubStack: shanebo: yeah, modified
[03:18] shanebo: SubStack so curr is after the modification and prev is before?

[03:20] dscape: DTrejo: use postmark
[03:20] dscape: not sendgrid
[03:20] Nuck: I'm using SMTP
[03:20] dscape: and contact them
[03:20] dscape: explain what u are doing and why its ok

[03:21] Nuck: I'm debating if I wanna use to Haraka eventually
[03:21] Nuck: DTrejo: Is this in response to events?
[03:21] DTrejo: thanks for the advice guys
[03:21] Nuck: DTrejo: For event-response emailing, postmark is unrivaled.
[03:21] Nuck: For mass email, I suggest doing SMTP or something manually
[03:22] DTrejo: it is related to http://hollaback.no.de/
[03:22] DTrejo: i think you can guess what I want to do :)
[03:22] dscape: DTrejo: if you want to use their http api but you have scripted a node_mailer thingy
[03:22] reid has joined the channel
[03:22] dscape: i did the same thing, lol
[03:22] dscape: and this was the monkey patched solution https://gist.github.com/1123036
[03:23] dscape: Alex Hillman is the guy to talk too, he's very nice
[03:23] Nuck: I was gonna do postmark, but then I decided against it
[03:23] Nuck: The thing is, it's not hard to set up my own mail servers
[03:24] Nuck: And to configure them to make it to the user's inbox
[03:24] stash1 has joined the channel
[03:24] Nuck: And the whole "measuring bounces" thing is 90% horse-shit, since the email protocols don't provide for such in-depth analyses.
[03:25] sneakyness has joined the channel
[03:25] Nuck: dscape: You know there's already Node.js modules to deal with postmark, right?
[03:25] dscape: Nuck: yeah
[03:25] dscape: but i started with send_grid
[03:25] dscape: which is smtp
[03:25] dscape: and used node_mailer (i think)
[03:25] dscape: then i had all the code set up
[03:26] Nuck: dscape: And you do realize that postmark ALSO provides an SMTP interface?
[03:26] dscape: and these guys at postmark say they will give me better errors and stuff on the http api
[03:26] Nuck: Ah
[03:26] Nuck: Well, that's highly unlikely
[03:26] dscape: so i created a quick and dirty postmark make look like node mailer thing
[03:26] Nuck: Since it's still the same mail protocols over the web
[03:26] dscape: so i didnt need to change my code to test them out

[03:27] dscape: Nuck
[03:27] dscape: SendGrid was terrible with me
[03:27] Nuck: dscape: Their ability to detect bounces is 90% horseshit
[03:27] dscape: but Postmark was reaaally awesome
[03:27] Nuck: The mail delivery protocols don't provide for such things
[03:28] Nuck: Though it would be nice if they did, it'd require a lot of work to get it adopted
[03:28] dscape: well they are a startup and should be set in solving that, as they say they focus on transactional email
[03:28] dscape: so I hope you are wrong Nuck 
[03:28] dscape: :)
[03:28] sneakyne_ has joined the channel
[03:28] Nuck: dscape: transactional email means when you have an event, you send off an email
[03:28] dscape: so far I got no problems
[03:28] Nuck: That's doable over any protocol
[03:29] DTrejo: thanks for the advice guys, I have to get dinner, but thank you so much for the advice! dscape i'll be back on soon to ask you questions :)
[03:29] Nuck: The thing that makes postmark and similar companies so popular is that they provide a simple API to send off an email :P
[03:29] ChrisPartridge: jeromegn: could certainly be useful
[03:29] dscape: DTrejo: 4:30AM is not really my best time but ok ;)
[03:29] jeromegn: def
[03:29] Nuck: That and their servers are generally set up flawlessly
[03:30] Nuck: But to get to a 99.99999999% success rate, it takes very little configuration beyond setting up a server
[03:30] kenperkins has joined the channel
[03:30] Nuck: To get to 98%, you just set a single DNS entry (SPF)
[03:30] Nuck: To get to 99.99999999%, you set up a feedback loop
[03:30] dscape: well Nuck if I had you in my team I would not need postmark then :P
[03:30] dscape: lol
[03:31] dscape: I was told my some folks from companies that sens tons of emails a day that using them was a good choice
[03:31] Nuck: dscape: I just did a lot of research when I was deciding on a route to take ;)
[03:31] dscape: e.g. groupon uses send_grid
[03:31] dscape: i think
[03:31] sneakyness has joined the channel
[03:31] Nuck: I was told about the feedback loop by somebody in here who has a company sending tons of emails a day
[03:31] dscape: interesting
[03:31] Nuck: They linked me to an article at AOL describing how to set up a feedback loop
[03:31] Nuck: Well, they WORK for a company that does
[03:31] Nuck: They don't have it :P
[03:31] dscape: Nuck: I'll make sure to ping you when we hit volume
[03:32] dscape: if we hit volume
[03:32] dscape: :)
[03:32] Nuck: dscape: lol volume?
[03:32] dscape: emails per day
[03:32] dscape: eheh
[03:32] Nuck: I'm founding a startup myself, so I did a lot of research on how to best deal with sending mails
[03:32] incredimike: I'm breaking my app up into multiple files. how do I automagically include a module (like underscore) in every file?
[03:33] Nuck: incredimike: require() it
[03:33] Nuck: I've been debating modding out Haraka to provide  a RESTful API
[03:33] incredimike: at the top of every file?
[03:33] dscape: Nuck: also using haraka?
[03:33] dscape: cool
[03:33] dscape: we are using it but just to receive email
[03:33] incredimike: that's what I'm trying to avoid :P
[03:33] Nuck: dscape: Well, I figured that a NodeJS server for email could be really great
[03:33] dscape: you should open source the code ;)
[03:33] Nuck: incredimike: Well, how are you connecting them all together?
[03:33] Nuck: dscape: I might :P
[03:34] sneakyne_ has joined the channel
[03:34] incredimike: rubber bands, elmers glue and lot of hope
[03:34] Nuck: dscape: My current project, however, is a good, general-use, non-buffering, streaming multipart parser
[03:34] dscape: the thing I deslike about haraka is the binary. i dont want a binary i would much rather have a project like express that is standalone
[03:34] dscape: the thing i like about haraka is everything else
[03:34] dscape: lol
[03:34] colinsullivan has left the channel
[03:34] Nuck: dscape: Binary?
[03:35] dscape: Haraka -c .
[03:35] dscape: kind of thing
[03:35] dscape: i'de rather node app.js
[03:35] Nuck: dscape: I was also thinking of doing that
[03:35] dscape: I know I can do that by cloning the repo
[03:35] incredimike: Nuck: in a similar fashion to this:   http://kiwidev.wordpress.com/2011/08/16/node-js-express-mongoose-js-and-modules/
[03:35] Nuck: Separating the Haraka mail sending and recieving stuff into a separate thing
[03:35] dscape: Nuck: yes
[03:36] Nuck: incredimike: To have shared variables, you can wrap each file in a function on module.exports that takes the shared variables as arguments
[03:36] incredimike: trying to keep app.js relatively sparse, only housing routes and such
[03:36] Nuck: And then do require('file.js')(foo, bar)
[03:36] incredimike: oh, really
[03:36] Nuck: That's how I roll
[03:36] Nuck: Can also do callbacks and such
[03:36] tjholowaychuk: i use "app" as a global most of the time
[03:36] incredimike: yea, I ws hoping for a more elegant solution
[03:37] tjholowaychuk: it's much more convenient
[03:37] incredimike: yeah I was considering that tj
[03:37] incredimike: didn't know if it was bad form tho
[03:37] Nuck: app as a global then requiring the files?
[03:37] tjholowaychuk: despite what people will tell you
[03:37] mikey_p: jerrysv: my shop: http://shomeya.com/
[03:37] tjholowaychuk: no it's not bad
[03:37] Nuck: tjholowaychuk: Interesting idea, didn't even think of it
[03:37] Nuck: But mine works a bit better with async stuff :P
[03:38] tjholowaychuk: unless you work with "application" forms or something and often call those vars "app" etc haha
[03:38] tjholowaychuk: then you'll run into trouble
[03:38] incredimike: heh
[03:38] Nuck: Fun to follow my async callback strings between files

[03:39] incredimike: well in my case I wanted a way to have underscore available in all my app files
[03:40] sneakyness has joined the channel
[03:40] Nuck: And then that callback is called when all my database connection code is done and my db functions are set
[03:40] tjholowaychuk: underscore isnt really all that useful on the SS
[03:40] incredimike: but even overriding app still adds a step
[03:40] Nuck: async.js
[03:40] incredimike: fair enough
[03:40] tjholowaychuk: overriding?
[03:40] incredimike: wrong choice of words

[04:09] tuhoojabotti: Yes.
[04:10] tuhoojabotti: watchfile doesn't read the file afaik.

[10:46] Raynos: http://jsfiddle.net/BpgC4/1/
[10:46] Raynos: Glenjamin it's significantly less feature rich
[10:47] Raynos: It's simply async.parallel with a single callback at the end

[11:04] Glenjamin: Raynos: does that have any advantages over series? It looks a bit clunkier and at a glance seems like it'd be less performant
[11:04] Raynos: Glenjamin: You can create and save a middleware stack.
[11:05] Glenjamin: you can keep the array you're going to pass to series too :)
[11:05] Glenjamin: but in general i find i'm closing over vars when using series
[11:05] yogurt_truck has joined the channel

[11:08] Raynos: I dont think like that.
[11:08] DrMcKay: now that's awesome
[11:08] DrMcKay: it's compiling uv
[11:09] iivvoo: blueadept callback is undefined?
[11:09] Raynos: I dont see the need for calling async in line with closures, I see the need for defining operations as a flow through a middleware stack, to neaten code up

[11:22] mrdoodles: if i wrote a nice scaffolding setup, which doesn't even need to run a bin to generate the required files. it just reads from controllers powered by models … what do i call this? :P
[11:22] Raynos: I want to heavily use middleware with express, and use the same middleware API and concepts with my database
[11:23] Glenjamin: ah
[11:23] Raynos: I'll let you know when it's ready
[11:23] Glenjamin: I think perhaps that i'm not using express/connect - therefore i'm not seeing the use case

[11:31] Raynos: mrdoodles: What in particular? half of it is a mess
[11:32] mrdoodles: i also use double quotes and am extremely anal about single quotes vs. double quotes, and commenting every single fucking line
[11:32] aaronmcadam: why?
[11:32] aaronmcadam: I always use single unless wrapping something containing them
[11:33] Glenjamin: single saves space!
[11:33] Raynos: I jump between double and single quotes because I don't bother normalizing them
[11:33] aaronmcadam: makes it easier
[11:33] Raynos: normally its double :P
[11:33] aaronmcadam: you don't end up having to escape quotes as much, well at least I don't

[11:35] Raynos: aaronmcadam: shame on you
[11:35] mrdoodles: aaronmcadam: yeah im not hating :P
[11:36] aaronmcadam: I'm in the middle of a jqmobile project, but moving onto node next
[11:36] mrdoodles: for me seeing var x = "whatever" … \n , y = "huh?"
[11:36] aaronmcadam: oh I always use one var statement
[11:37] mrdoodles: it's my hesitance to contribute to node
[11:37] aaronmcadam: but commas starting the next?
[11:37] mrdoodles: bad example the one var
[11:37] jkj_: why do people use one var statement?
[11:37] jkj_: sedability/grepability suffers
[11:37] aaronmcadam: faster 
[11:37] mrdoodles: but yeah commands on second line before next statement i find it …. nonintuitive
[11:37] mrdoodles: speed
[11:37] jkj_: speed of code, something else?

[11:39] mrdoodles: yes, well it is backend js
[11:39] mrdoodles: on the frontend big diff
[11:39] Glenjamin: var on each line is better for grep, one var saves you a few bytes - so i'd go with one var per line
[11:39] Glenjamin: frontend not really, cos you'd always minify anyway
[11:39] mrdoodles: ACTION high five to Glenjamin 
[11:39] mrdoodles: ahh ok

[11:41] mrdoodles: I've been using nodemon, but only because its what i found first - (i asked in the channel about a ruby style shotgun gem)
[11:41] mrdoodles: also forever seems way cooler to type than nodemon, i sound like I'm a jamaiican coder about to get high
[11:41] robinduckett: ja mon
[11:42] aaronmcadam: forever start robinduckett ?
[11:42] mrdoodles: by deploy i meant like style so "rake deploy:production" which would place everything in /public to backspace cloud files, after minifying and pngcrushing images

[11:43] robinduckett: forever start scriptname.js

[12:29] DrMcKay: !npm search test
[12:29] jhbot: packages (short format, truncated): johnny-mnemonic, keyjson, m1test, node-assert-lint-free, node-casa, unittest-jslint, async_testing, jslitmus, macrotest, mjsunit.runner, node-build, nodeunit-dsl, patr, deckard, drain, plants.js, expressobdd, stories, bn-unit, gdata
[12:29] DrMcKay: !npm info keyjson
[12:29] DrMcKay: meh, no like that
[12:29] DrMcKay: tiemonster: you want to search or what?
[12:30] tiemonster: well I wrote a Node.js extension for doing geospatial arithmetic, and I'm wondering if it's worth publishing
[12:30] DrMcKay: tiemonster: sure it is
[12:30] tiemonster: there are several npm packages called geo something but there is little to no metadata
[12:31] DrMcKay: tiemonster: they should have something like repo url
[12:31] tiemonster: I don't see anything
[12:31] tiemonster: like this one for example: http://search.npmjs.org/#/geoutils
[12:31] garrensmith: !npm search couch

[12:32] DrMcKay: tiemonster: I googled description

[12:34] DrMcKay: tiemonster: publish it :)
[12:35] tiemonster: I should probably match the API of that package so it's a drop-in replacement
[12:35] tiemonster: geospatial arithmetic is CPU-bound, so writing it in C++ just made more sense
[12:36] tiemonster: in our very unscientific benchmarks, it takes about 1/3 of the time
[12:36] DrMcKay: tiemonster: wow, that's big
[12:36] fumanchu182 has joined the channel
[12:36] DrMcKay: tiemonster: what computations does it perform?
[12:36] deoxxa: tiemonster: would the c++ portion live happily outside node?
[12:36] DrMcKay: (I'm a noob when it comes to geospatial)
[12:37] tiemonster: distance between points, adding distance to a point using bearing, etc
[12:37] tiemonster: it's a self-sustaining C++ class with a node wrapper, yes
[12:37] deoxxa: ah cool
[12:38] DrMcKay: tiemonster: well, wow.
[12:38] DrMcKay: tiemonster: I was just wondering, we have a project with few guys here
[12:38] deoxxa: i'm writing a purpose-built database for geozone information at work, i'd love to take a look-see at it if for no reason other than to get some inspiration :)

[12:41] ryanfitz has joined the channel
[12:41] DrMcKay: deoxxa: would you mind telling me a bit more about this DB?
[12:41] tiemonster: here's the library, if you're interested: https://github.com/stetson/Capture-The-Flag/blob/master/modules/Algorithms.cc
[12:41] tiemonster: it needs some work to be more generic and useful
[12:42] tiemonster: not the least of which is using km throughout instead of mi
[12:42] DrMcKay: tiemonster: have you though about using some parallel computation?
[12:42] tiemonster: um, nope
[12:43] DrMcKay: tiemonster: it may speed up computations
[12:43] tiemonster: of distance?
[12:43] DrMcKay: tiemonster: (I mean, SSE and things)
[12:43] tiemonster: it takes like 4ms per computation
[12:43] tiemonster: and could be faster if done with just km
[12:44] tiemonster: SSE?
[12:44] Glenjamin: really?
[12:44] tiemonster: Glenjamin: it was fast, I remember that
[12:44] Glenjamin: surely km/mi is just a scale factor?
[12:44] DrMcKay: tiemonster: with SSE you could take, for example array of data and compute it all at once
[12:44] tiemonster: not my area of expertise
[12:45] DrMcKay: tiemonster: well, these algorithms can be optimized a bit with it
[12:46] deoxxa: i am gay
[12:46] DrMcKay: tiemonster: but after all, it'll be node to consume it, so I don't know if it makes sense

[13:28] DrMcKay: bnoordhuis: should lib/sys.js be there?
[13:28] tuhoojabotti: I love that game.
[13:29] bnoordhuis: DrMcKay: yes
[13:29] DrMcKay: bnoordhuis: so should I just uncomment this error?
[13:29] franck34: it's a kaazing gw, they recently change stomp message format and they are using binary structure. I'm a fucking noob regarding binary structure in an http persistant request

[18:12] MikeW: brainproxy: I think for the most part I was looking for a way to do templating, but templates that can render on both the client and server
[18:12] dscape: you think its because I didn't do var f instead of f?
[18:12] matyr_ has joined the channel
[18:12] MikeW: brainproxy: So the server can spit out completely rendered pages for downlevel clients like search engine crawlers
[18:12] brainproxy: MikeW: ah, gotcha
[18:13] balaa has joined the channel
[18:14] bradleymeck: dscape yes, not having a var statement means it will be treated as a global, so the last assignment will be the only assignment

[20:49] augustl: are there ways to preventDefault()-ish in the "request" event of a server? I want to write a library  that can hook itself into an existing server. And if my library detects a request it can handle, I want it to stop any other request handlers from running.
[20:49] malkomalko: peaches? lol

[20:49] malkomalko: TheJH, just looking for a way to override a global for a test.. which I know how to do, just trying to write a test helper to restore all of my stubbed globals before each test
[20:49] augustl: malkomalko: you could use sinon
[20:50] TheJH: augustl, that would be hooks, not listeners
[20:50] malkomalko: I'm a big sinon user.. but I don't think it works very well with anything assigned via global.
[20:50] dannycoates: rauchggg: awesome :)
[20:50] augustl: sinon.stub(global) in setUp doesn't work?
[20:50] TheJH: augustl, you *could* monkeypatch its emit function... but doesn't sound like a good idea

[20:51] malkomalko: not really augustl.. brb
[20:52] augustl: malkomalko: make sure you set up a sandbox of course

[20:59] TheJH: jesusabdullah, but that only works because couch will, even if you just change one character in a document, append the new document to the file, append a bunch of btree nodes to the file and append a new footer at the next 4096-byte-boundary (zero-padded to reach it)

[21:31] StanlySoManly1 has joined the channel
[21:31] DrMcKay: Benny_: or npm install express --node-version 0.4.11
[21:31] isaacs: Benny_: tjholowaychuk usually doesn't bother to track unstable versions.  i can't blame him.
[21:32] isaacs: Benny_: yeah, or that ^
[21:32] tjholowaychuk: i did a bit the last time
[21:32] tjholowaychuk: but i dont have time to keep up with both this time around
[21:33] Benny_: And is there any chance that Express will be updated? I really like to use the latest versions.
[21:33] Benny_: But thanks a lot
[21:33] tjholowaychuk: that should be an npm thing
[21:33] tjholowaychuk: IMO
[21:33] tjholowaychuk: if you want to force it
[21:33] CoverSlide: +1
[21:33] tjholowaychuk: otherwise you're stuck waiting for 0.6.0
[21:33] CoverSlide: npm install --justFuckingInstallAlready express
[21:34] tjholowaychuk: hahaha
[21:34] isaacs: CoverSlide, tjholowaychuk: so, you can do "--node-version null" and it'll just skip that check.
[21:34] tjholowaychuk: ah
[21:34] isaacs: CoverSlide, tjholowaychuk: the problem is that then you can end up in a bad place
[21:34] tjholowaychuk: it's just not clear i guess
[21:34] tjholowaychuk: even though half the people that get confused about it not working for 0.5.x, dont even know that odds are unstable

[21:35] CoverSlide: see, --force would make more sense to me
[21:35] isaacs: what you want to do is filter to all the versions of everything that work on version X
[21:35] CoverSlide: but that's taken
[21:35] isaacs: but there has to be some "target" node version that you're installing against, or else you'll end up in a bad place, where things that can never work together end up in the same install target.
[21:36] tjholowaychuk: they'll end up in a bad place with untested stuff
[21:36] tjholowaychuk: regardless
[21:36] Benny_: From github - "Express 3.x (master branch) is compatible with node 0.6.x and connect 2.x"

[23:07] gerad: node knockout leader board is up!
[23:07] gerad: please up vote http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2947977
[23:08] cconstantine: I have a node service whose performance is slowly degrading under production load.  what would be the best way to get profiling to figure out where the inefficiencies in my code are?
[23:08] jerrysv: gerad: working on it, i promise :/

[23:09] gerad: jerrysv: cool thx
[23:09] bnoordhuis: cconstantine: node / v8 has a profiler built in
[23:10] cconstantine: is there a page describing it?
[23:10] bnoordhuis: cconstantine: google for 'v8 profiler', that should point you in the right direction
[23:10] Sorella has joined the channel
[23:11] bnoordhuis: cconstantine: node-profiler lets you turn on/off the profiler at runtime
[23:11] alefnula: Hi, this is maybe a stupid question but why is EventEmitter.emit blocking? Isn't that a little bit against the whole node async philosophy? Thanks in advance for explanation :)

[23:12] bnoordhuis: alefnula: emit isn't blocking
[23:12] alefnula: it waits for all the callbacks to return
[23:12] trotter has joined the channel
[23:12] bnoordhuis: what else should it do?
[23:13] alefnula: maybe just process.nextTick(callback ... ) and return
[23:13] AaronMT has joined the channel
[23:13] alefnula: I said that it's maybe a stupid question :)
[23:14] cconstantine: bnoordhuis, the npm module?
[23:14] bnoordhuis: cconstantine: yes
[23:14] cconstantine: bnoordhuis, thanks
[23:15] bnoordhuis: alefnula: why would you want to defer it to the next tick? (taking the socratic approach here)
[23:15] bnoordhuis: your event listeners have to run anyway and delaying that until after the event is only confusing
[23:16] edude03 has joined the channel
[23:16] alefnula: one of the things that pop into my mind: because for some crazy reason one of the listeners is doing writeFileSync or something like that... Maybe he needs it to be sync, but I don't have to wait for that...
[23:17] bnoordhuis: you never need to use writeFileSync
[23:17] bnoordhuis: it's a convenience function, nothing more
[23:18] Daegalus has joined the channel
[23:19] alefnula: I know, but if something exist someone *will* use it :) but ok, it was just a question :) so basically the answer is: it's intended to be blocking :)
[23:20] abiii_ has joined the channel
[23:20] bnoordhuis: alefnula: yes
[23:21] pandeiro has joined the channel
[23:22] cconstantine: bnoordhuis, if I telnet into the server (with the repl module) and initiate the profiler it just locks the node process
[23:22] bnoordhuis: cconstantine: you mean with node-profiler?
[23:22] cconstantine: NODE_ENV=production nod--prof -prof_lazy server.js
[23:23] cconstantine: yes
[23:23] bnoordhuis: cconstantine: is your app being hit really hard? that's about the only reasonable explanation
[23:23] cconstantine: bnoordhuis, yes
[23:24] cconstantine: bnoordhuis, is there a way to have it start profiling at load, and dump the profile file when I ^C the node process?
[23:24] steveC has joined the channel
[23:24] jesusabdullah: Anybody here good at vows and willing to tell me what I did wrong?
[23:24] bnoordhuis: cconstantine: you'd have to add a timer that checks os.loadavg()
[23:25] jbrokc has joined the channel
[23:25] cconstantine: hu?
[23:25] steveC has left the channel
[23:25] Daegalus: If I am new to Node.js, and want to start it, should I go with the 0.4.11 version or the newer 0.5.5 version?
[23:26] bradleymeck has joined the channel
[23:26] tmpvar: 0.4.11
[23:26] bnoordhuis: cconstantine: setInterval(checker, 1000)
[23:26] bnoordhuis: cconstantine: where checker is a function that checks os.loadavg()
[23:26] Daegalus: tmpvar: any reasoning on why? just curious
[23:26] tmpvar: Daegalus, even versions are stable ;)
[23:26] tjholowaychuk: haha see ^ no one gets it
[23:26] cconstantine: bnoordhuis, setInterval isn't a bad idea.... but I don't understand what os.loadavg has to do with this
[23:27] bnoordhuis: cconstantine: you want it to start profiling when the load rises, right?
[23:27] cconstantine: meh

[23:28] Daegalus: tmpvar: ok, but what kind of unstable? Stuff liek it crashing for no reason, or actual syntax/coding/etc unstable? Im asking because if its just the crashing kind, I don't mind. I like bleeding edge stuff.
[23:28] cconstantine: I mostly want to do the profiling from start to when I'm done
[23:29] mrchess: Daegalus: use 0.4.11
[23:29] mrchess: Daegalus: defintiely more battle tested
[23:29] bnoordhuis: cconstantine: start is program startup?
[23:29] cconstantine: bnoordhuis, I"ll just add and endpoint that calls profile.pause
[23:29] cconstantine: bnoordhuis, yes
[23:29] Daegalus: ok, thank you. Sorry, just wanted to make sure I get off to a good start. So far from what Ive read and tried, I am really liking node.js
[23:30] guidocalvano has joined the channel
[23:30] mrchess: yeah the 0.5 series is marked unstable.. so yea use at your own risk if you use 0.5 :)

[23:38] bnoordhuis: cconstantine: is the location writable by the user node runs as?
[23:38] bnoordhuis: location = directory
[23:38] cconstantine: yes
[23:38] cconstantine: does node have to be compiled specially to have the profiler?

[23:40] cconstantine: bnoordhuis, ah, asking the question fixed it somehow
[23:40] Benny_: What should I install if I want to run multiple node applications on my VPS? I have a few friends and they wants to host their applications on my server.
[23:40] Benny_: *want
[23:41] bnoordhuis: cconstantine: v8's profiler is a little finicky, if you ctrl-c your app it might not write the log file
[23:41] gxdssoft has joined the channel
[23:41] cconstantine: bnoordhuis, I just added 2 endpoints start_profile, and stop_profile

[23:45] cconstantine: bnoordhuis, when I try to run the profiler 'linux-tick-processor' it attempts to compile something and fails because it can't find 'gnu/stubs-32.h'   any ideas?
[23:46] bnoordhuis: cconstantine: what version of node is this?
[23:46] bnoordhuis: i talked the v8 team out of auto-building stuff from inside linux-tick-processor
[23:47] cconstantine: 4.10?
[23:47] cconstantine: 0.4.10
[23:47] Destos has joined the channel
[23:48] bnoordhuis: cconstantine: right, that one still has the auto-build stuff in it

[23:51] deoxxa: d8?
[23:51] guidocalvano has joined the channel
[23:51] bnoordhuis: oh, i talked to myself
