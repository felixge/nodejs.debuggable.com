[00:42] Jarred: This is on Arch Linux
[00:43] Jarred: with the nodejs package 
[00:43] Jarred: What other information could I provide to make this easier for you guys to help me?

[00:45] thinkt4nk has joined the channel
[00:45] Jarred: Here's the NPM debug file https://gist.github.com/92a70b659cc8fe093239
[00:45] ningu: Eruadan: yes, it installs in your NODE_MODULES directory -- you should only use it if the module has a binary you need to access

[00:47] criswell has joined the channel
[00:47] ningu: I shouldn't say binary, just command -- things that are executable
[00:47] Eruadan: ohh, i see
[00:47] Eruadan: cheers
[00:48] ningu: but if you want it in an app just install it locally
[00:49] ningu: Eruadan: for example I have node-inspector installed globally so if I want to debug I can just run node-inspector from the cmdline
[00:50] Eruadan: mm, i see, i understand. 
[00:50] Eruadan: so there's no sense to install backbone with -g
[00:51] ningu: not afaik, I haven't used it
[00:51] ningu: Jarred: hrm... and everything in node_modules is writable to npm, I assume?

[01:17] Eruadan: why don't just compile it yourself?
[01:17] Jarred: because its unneccessary
[01:18] Octayn: It's most certainly necessary if you want to build any packages that are C++ bindings or extensions

[01:19] Jarred: from the repository
[01:19] Jarred: main*
[01:19] Eruadan: curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
[01:20] Octayn: To install npm like that you need node.
[01:21] Jarred: compiling

[03:29] SubStack: yes
[03:29] SubStack: well how do you mean and for what I guess?
[03:29] konobi: i was thinking of adding a running_timeout option to it, so that on each "result" event, it would reset the overall timer... does that seem sane to you?
[03:29] SubStack: I'm using the tap producer in testling for tap output
[03:29] Nuck: Is there any way to get longer stack traces in Node? >_>
[03:30] Nuck: Like, easy way
[03:30] boehm has joined the channel
[03:30] konobi: also... what are your thoughts on the default timeouts per test()
[03:30] konobi: Nuck: stackTraceLimit
[03:30] konobi: it defaults to 10
[03:30] SubStack: the default timeouts seem to work fine
[03:30] konobi: SubStack: 30secs
[03:31] konobi: most stuff you're doing in the browser though, right?
[03:31] SubStack: no
[03:32] SubStack: testling uses its own runner and only uses tap-producer for the output=tap param

[03:53] zackattack: Do you guys think I should get a separate VPS(linode) for the staging version of my app?
[03:54] SubStack: zackattack: you can probably just spin up your staging instance alongside the production one
[03:54] SubStack: then it's easier to flip a switch to swap out production with staging
[03:55] zackattack: How do i do that!
[03:55] SubStack: just spin it up on a different port!
[03:55] zackattack: btw, i'm using dnode again, because the service that calculates my leaderboard could hypothetically take a long time and be blocking
[03:55] SubStack: you could use an http proxy to route accordingly
[03:55] SubStack: like bouncy or node-http-proxy
[03:56] zackattack: Huh?

[04:01] SubStack: well you could have a static staging port

[04:04] zackattack: i really need to clean up my nginx configuration
[04:04] zackattack: it's hideous and it's causing trouble
[04:04] SubStack: you could just put bouncy in front and rip out all the non-cgi logic
[04:04] zackattack: is that easier
[04:05] zackattack: oh wow
[04:05] zackattack: that looks a lot easier

[07:09] tonymilne: jesusabdullah yeah, but back me up here if you have an opinion, but surely the server is the thing to focus on, not the iOS app!?!
[07:10] tonymilne: the app is just a view to the JSON based server API.
[07:12] airandfingers: is there a good module out there for serving up static files in such a way that users can navigate the static directory tree? i believe apache defaults to this, when displaying a directory with no index.html files
[07:13] jesusabdullah: tonymilne: I mean, I suppose it's possible for an iOS app to have vulnerabilities, but my instinct is that the server would be the thing to focus on yes
[07:13] jesusabdullah: keep in mind I know next to nothing about iOS apps

[07:30] hermanjunge: the problem is the foreach

[11:19] benvie: no problem =D node-gyp made it super easy!

[11:19] purr: Let it be known that benvie hearts node-gyp.
[11:20] benvie: last time it was a pain cause there was no documentation and I had to manually make the projects and figure out all the stuff

[11:20] antono has joined the channel
[11:21] yumatov has joined the channel
[11:21] benvie: my only other experience with node-gyp was with tty.js which I knew wasn't going to work but I wanted to see what would happen
[11:21] benvie: unsurprisingly trying to compile a forkPty module on windows was less than successful
[11:22] Edy has joined the channel
[11:23] benvie: chjj you should somehow digest all of this file and make it work in pty.js https://gist.github.com/1893415
[11:24] chjj: benvie: what am i looking at here? a windows terminal?
[11:24] benvie: you're looking at the only method I've ever heard of for forking a process (specifically terminal/cmd) that exists
[11:24] chjj: ooo its ReactOS code haha
[11:24] AdamSeabrook1 has joined the channel
[11:24] benvie: using a large amount of internal windows apis
[11:25] benvie: it's most/all of the building blocks for forkPty on windows
[11:25] chjj: the problem is, even if that did work, tty.js is a vt100/xterm emulator
[11:25] chjj: i dont think the windows console is a real terminal emulator
[11:25] benvie: it basically reconstructs the entire thing piece by piece in order to fork it
[11:25] benvie: the environment, the memory, etc.
[11:25] benvie: so it is in fact a complete duplicate
[11:26] chjj: so i would have to write a windows "terminal emulator" or whatever windows does to make a black window with white characters in it
[11:26] benvie: yeah
[11:26] benvie: well really
[11:26] benvie: what needs to happen is a version of putty stripped down and compiled as a node module
[11:26] chjj: or somehow translate a windows "terminal" to a vt100
[11:27] benvie: which is doable and on my list
[11:27] benvie: or mintty
[11:27] superjoe has joined the channel
[11:27] chjj: libuv does some goofy stuff to convert csi sequences to windows-language
[11:27] benvie: whatever can be done to rip out basically the minimal communications components to get it talking to libuv, and rendering
[11:27] benvie: no
[11:27] beawesomeinstead has joined the channel
[11:27] chjj: but i think thats the opposite way i would want to go
[11:27] benvie: well yeah but
[11:27] benvie: to do it on windows you need to completely ignore the windows console bullshit
[11:28] benvie: you can't even use the windows console api to render
[11:28] benvie: talking to the windows api will be purely limited to making it maximally compatible/accessible from other programs but not for rendering or anything at all really aside from that
[11:28] chjj: the problem is, windows programs would be using the windows console api
[11:29] daleharvey has joined the channel
[11:29] benvie: my understanding is that there's a better result that can be achieved than has been so far
[11:29] benvie: in terms of essentially hooking into the stdin/out streams of a defacto "console"
[11:29] benvie: while not using that window as the ultimate interface
[11:29] benvie: simply as a dummy to get other stuff treating you like a terminal
[11:30] chjj: the only reason tty.js works is because terminals originally talked over a serial port, i just use a websocket instead. if windows uses some weird internal api, i dont know if theres a way it could work.
[11:30] benvie: console2 is supposedly the one example of a program that takes this tact but it seems to do it pretty terribly
[11:30] benvie: it's possible to do that in windows..if you have a serial port
[11:30] benvie: which I won't
[11:30] benvie: I tried lol
[11:30] benvie: you can create a character device on a serial port in windows but you can't really fake the serial port part
[11:31] chjj: maybe i could get something working without any kind of complex behavior, it would just be a dumb terminal
[11:31] benvie: well I have a bit more grandiose goals maybe
[11:31] benvie: but i want a full real terminal on windows
[11:31] chjj: that would be cool
[11:32] benvie: I want essentially mintty or putty but not died to the mingw shit or anything beides nodes. Node can handle all the io, it just needs a renderer
[11:32] chjj: i just dont know how it could work, unless you could convince windows programs to spit out control sequences instead of using the windows console api
[11:32] benvie: node already does
[11:32] chjj: node goes the other way, it converts control sequences to windows console api
[11:33] benvie: I mean I can connect directly opening the file if I hack node a bunch to make it treat mintty like a tty instead of a pipe
[11:33] benvie: I can get colors and all that shit
[11:33] benvie: if it's just willing to output the escape sequences
[11:33] chjj: i should look at the mintty code
[11:33] gut4 has joined the channel
[11:33] chjj: maybe theres a clue there
[11:33] benvie: the point is that these programs have full ansi parsers built in
[11:33] benvie: putty and all its descendents handle it all
[11:33] benvie: they don't let the OS do it
[11:33] benvie: like you're doing on the browser
[11:33] chjj: ACTION looks at the mintty code.
[11:34] niftylettuce has joined the channel
[11:34] benvie: that's how I get xterm-256 and near full unix compatability using cygwin
[11:34] benvie: the trick is to divorce it from all that cruft and just get the minimal bits out that node can't do
[11:34] herbySk has joined the channel
[11:35] jol has joined the channel
[11:35] chjj: so that is what you mean, you dont want a real windows console, you want a mintty type thing?
[11:35] benvie: I want a console that can be treated like one to everything else in windows but has its own renderer
[11:35] benvie: which isn't a solved problem quite, but it's close
[11:35] benvie: all the stuff that does it relies on mingw still
[11:35] icebox: benvie: I have been trying that contextify ...no require('bindings')?
[11:35] jol: could i get some guidance on wether on not Node.js is suitable for my project?
[11:36] chjj: well, im looking at the mintty code right now. ill try to see if i can figure it out.
[11:36] benvie: I just compiled the binary. I would assume you have to follow the conventions of the binding's module
[11:36] icebox: benvie: I get Error: Cannot find module 'bindings'
[11:36] benvie: which would be like
[11:36] benvie: yeah that's another module
[11:36] benvie: npm install bindings
[11:36] icebox: benvie: ah ok
[11:36] benvie: it handles the cross-platform lookups for compiled binaries
[11:36] piscisaureus_ has joined the channel
[11:36] benvie: contextify uses it now looks like
[11:37] benvie: you'll need it in some specific direcotry too
[11:37] benvie: I think maybe contextify/out/Release or something
[11:37] benvie: the .node
[11:37] misza222 has joined the channel
[11:38] icebox: benvie: the old folder was build/Release
[11:38] benvie: chjj I know some chunks of it will be implemented using various mingw platform stuff
[11:38] benvie: but I think most of that is just for hooking up the networking stuff
[11:38] benvie: which I'd defer largely to node if I was trying to relpicate it, if that's not obvious =D
[11:39] benvie: any of the windows API stuff is largely implemented in windows-terms with the mingw stuff
[11:39] jol: i have an application that calls 40 rows new rows from a db every 5 seconds or so with an ajax call to a php script, have only read a little about Node.js and was wondering would it be better for this?
[11:40] icebox: benvie: after installing bindings and putting the binary in build/Release it work nice... thanks
[11:40] benvie: awesome, good to know it worked there =D

[11:40] tiglionabbit has joined the channel
[11:40] benvie: I just included the .node directly so I didn't get to make sure it worked like normal
[11:40] chjj: benvie: is mintty only meant to compile under cygwin? all of the code is rather unix-y
[11:41] chjj: looking at putty now
[11:41] benvie: yeah originally it was derived from putty and has mostly run under cyginw. Over the last year it's become runnable under mingw but that's still going to be unixy
[11:41] benvie: just less so
[11:41] benvie: but I think putty is the even more compatible one these days
[11:42] benvie: with normal windows stuff
[11:42] benvie: I need to look at the code in depth to see what it might take to do something with it as a node module
[11:42] benvie: the problem is that all these existing programs have this massive amount of old shoddy networking code that really is unnecessary
[11:43] velo has joined the channel
[11:43] benvie: but burried in there is a bunch of gems for making shit work well on windows

[12:57] hatmam: i have this guy: http://mashface.net/llui/ , it fetches the pictures url from a db with an ajax call to a php script, and i plan on having new urls called every couple of seconds, would Node.js be more suitable for this than php and ajax calls?
[12:59] maritz: hatmam: juts simple rest calls basically? there's no real advantage in using node.js for just that. now, if you want to push the changes from the db via websockets to the browser (aka. live updates), node.js would be the better choice.

[13:13] garrettwilkin: okay
[13:13] maritz: hatmam: good. now, if you don't mind learning new languages and environments and don't need this to be done in 5 minutes and have it run in a huge production environment, you can go with node.js. :)

[13:42] garrettwilkin: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8263652/node-js-accurate-timer
[13:42] sriley: if youre using getInterval/setTimeout and only use the date once at start then yea that wont be accurate

[13:42] garrettwilkin: and just notify the client?
[13:43] garrettwilkin: shouldn't that be more accurate?
[13:43] Topcat: yeah that makes more sense, but how can have node emit and event as say 11am ?
[13:44] Virendra: node.js has this... (function(process) {......}

[14:07] maritz: oh, ok
[14:07] yawNO: there's no such framework afaik
[14:08] csteen has joined the channel
[14:08] maritz: you don't really need much of a framework for that. just a good mvc structure. then have different views for .json and .html and let the router tell the controller which view to chose
[14:09] yawNO: of course, and you could do the same with the auth system
[14:10] yawNO: but having a structure at the bottom would semplify a lot
[14:10] yawNO: that's what frameworks are for
[14:12] rauchg has joined the channel
[14:13] maritz: i'm still not sure what the problem is. essentially you'd create a layer on top of res.render() that looks at the request (or something provided by the router) to decide whether the data form the controller (or route handler) shoudl be passed to res.render('somefile.json') or res.render('somefile.jade'). that's like 5 lines of code?!

[15:59] chjj: Vainoharhainen: if you just want to read an entire file, all you need is fs.readFile, fs.read is a much lower level interface. it just wraps read(2)

[16:00] tuhoojabotti: True.
[16:00] Vainoharhainen: chjj: i need to wrap it bc its to my bot :P

[16:04] chjj: i dont understand what youre saying. you said you got an error already

[18:11] ningu: I don't really trust ORMs to properly migrate anyway

[18:13] ningu: I keep getting my mongodb data in states I didn't anticipate -- a field missing or something accidentally set as a collection rather than objectid
[18:13] ningu: partly due to the learning curve with mongoose
[18:13] RLa: you might want more type-heavy db
[18:13] RLa: something that existing sql bases can do

[18:15] freewil: ningu, what type of data are you working with
[18:15] jdeibele has joined the channel
[18:15] freewil: its possible to do ad-hoc transactions if possible in mongo, really PITA though
[18:15] freewil: s/if possible/if needed
[18:16] ningu: freewil: well, for example, I am storing dictionary data from languages, and one thing I do is create a new lexicon, where the user fills out a form and enters its name, author, etc. and uploads a file in a format the app knows how to parse
[18:16] ningu: I need to create the lexicon document so I have an id that the entries can refer to
[18:16] ningu: but if the parsing goes wrong, then I'm stuck with a lexicon document with no entries
[18:16] ningu: but actually, come to think of it, I can get the id without saving it

[18:19] ningu: because it's nice to be able to treat entries as first class objects

[18:23] jmar777: it's not obvious to me whether or not a valid application/json body MUST be an object or array at the top level, or if it's also ok for it to contain just JSON values
[18:23] kuebk: copying it in wscript at shutdown?
[18:23] kuebk: or maybe there is a better way?
[18:23] RobWC has joined the channel
[18:23] jmar777: e.g., is '\"hello world\"' a valid application/json body?
[18:24] smallfoot-: freewil, node.js is best for this, or i should use python, ruby, php or erlang?
[18:24] kuebk: jmar777 json is between {}
[18:24] sdwrage has joined the channel
[18:24] smallfoot-: i can do WebSockets in node.js?
[18:24] jmar777: kuebk: right, but the RFC on application/json makes it sound like {} or [] at a minimum are acceptable
[18:24] hh__: i dont get why mongodb won't let you have objectids for embedded docs, thats the only thing that... makes embeedded weird to me
[18:24] mmalecki: smallfoot-: yes
[18:24] jmar777: kuebk: and it's not clear to me whether or not JSON values are also ok
[18:25] freewil: smallfoot-, yeah socket.io is a popular lib for node.js with websockets
[18:25] freewil: supports fallback to long-polling and regular ajax polling
[18:25] kuebk: JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
[18:25] DavidIAm: it doesn't actually prohibit values as valid json strings.
[18:25] smallfoot-: oh
[18:25] kuebk: and string
[18:25] kuebk: is not an object
[18:25] smallfoot-: if i want high-performance ascynchronus event-driven websocket, i should use node.js or C#?
[18:26] ningu: hh__: objectids are references, not embedded docs
[18:26] DavidIAm: an application/json body is 'a json value' which is string number object array true false or null
[18:26] freewil: smallfoot-, node.js - but im highly biased
[18:26] jmar777: kuebk: i understand that. i'm simply saying that from the RFC, it appears that application/json may not be exactly equivalent with JSON
[18:26] leokaito has joined the channel
[18:26] hh__: ningu: right, but for an embedded doc there's no way to give it an objectid for reference
[18:26] ningu: hh__: sure there is
[18:26] ningu: mongoose does it
[18:26] ningu: I'm not sure how
[18:27] strager: smallfoot-: Either will work, but Node.js will have less friction (assuming you're familiar with JS).
[18:27] jmar777: DavidIAm: thanks - can you point me towards some documentation on that?

[18:27] dilvie has joined the channel

[18:28] incon has joined the channel
[18:28] TooTallNate has left the channel
[18:28] hh__: both, mongoose doesn't support it, because it's not part of mongodb's specs or whatever 
[18:28] smallfoot-: node.js is suitable for high-performance real-time stuff? like game server?
[18:28] TooTallNate has joined the channel
[18:28] ningu: hh__: if you have a subschema in mongoose it will give it an _id by default
[18:28] ningu: unless you specify noId: true in teh subschema's definition
[18:29] strager: smallfoot-: Yes, though it's not suitable for computationally expensive things.

[18:31] ningu: just wondering if someone already had. :)
[18:31] RLa: json is very simple format and could be implemented in assembly too
[18:31] RLa: unlike xml :P

[18:32] jsurfer has joined the channel
[18:32] jmar777: DavidIAm: thanks - that's the rfc i'm looking at. i just can't find anywhere that states that any JSON value is acceptable as an application/json body
[18:32] jmar777: DavidIAm: he defines JSON-text as "object / array", but then he never refers to that term again
[18:33] stephank has joined the channel
[18:33] DavidIAm: jmar - oversight.
[18:33] DavidIAm: jmar - just a value that is a true falls null or string is not very useful
[18:33] jmar777: DavidIAm: and in the examples at the bottom, it shows one with a full JSON object and one with a JSON array - so those are the hints that suggest objects/arrays are it
[18:33] strager: I personally send JSON strings as application/json.
[18:33] colinclark_ has joined the channel
[18:33] jetienne_ has joined the channel
[18:34] DavidIAm: jmar777 - you're trying to read implications from examples, they show merely the mentality of the author, not the definition.
[18:34] DavidIAm: jmar777 - my logic is thus:
[18:34] DavidIAm: jmar777 - all his examples show json values.
[18:34] strager: I don't think it really matters, because your client is probably not a JSON proxy or something, but something custom-tailored to your API.
[18:34] DavidIAm: jmar777 - string/true/false/null are json values.
[18:34] jmar777: DavidIAm: yes, i agree. but we're both reasoning from examples though :\
[18:34] DavidIAm: jmar777 - there is nothing here that indicates that only a subset of valid json values is valid as an application/json string.  ANY json value, hence, IS.
[18:35] M1l3n1um has joined the channel
[18:36] DavidIAm: jmar777 - were it intended to restrict application/json encoding to *only* a subset of value types, then it must state so.
[18:36] jmar777: DavidIAm:  Well, he does refer to "JSON text" in several locations following his "JSON-text" definition. so if those are equivalent, then i would still interpret it as object/array
[18:36] NinjaFox^AFK has joined the channel
[18:36] jmar777: DavidIAm: i get what you're saying. i just don't see anywhere that says "JSON values" (restricted or otherwise) are acceptable application/json bodies
[18:36] DavidIAm: jmar - object and array are json values.
[18:37] DavidIAm: jmar - they are provided as 'examples of' json values, not 'the only exclusive json values accepted'.  THey're a non-inclusive list.
[18:37] jsurfer has joined the channel
[18:37] jmar777: DavidIAm: yes. but that in and of itself doesn't make them valid application/json bodies. i think what makes them valid is their inclusion in the definition of "JSON-text"... but i'm not sure on that point
[18:37] shipit_ has joined the channel
[18:38] DavidIAm: jmar777 - ah, I hadn't seen that piece.

[18:38] jmar777: DavidIAm: i just wish that "JSON-text" appeared more than once lol

[18:38] raenger: Having trouble using fs.rename from root disk / to attached storage /media/... -- an obvious answer?
[18:38] jmar777: DavidIAm: if "JSON-text" === "JSON text" for the purposes of the RFC, then it's useful i suppose

[18:39] volkan_ has joined the channel
[18:39] jmar777: DavidIAm: cool. so with that "established", would you consider application/json to be object/array only then?
[18:40] felixge: rauchg: will you be around later today (in 2-3 hours?). I got one more question about the patch I'd like to discuss. Basically it seems like the handshake is missing one parameter the clients needs to do the heartbeat properly
[18:40] DavidIAm: jmar777 - Per this RFC, Yes.
[18:40] EhevuTov has joined the channel
[18:40] rauchg: yep
[18:40] DavidIAm: jmar777 - I suspect that parsers wil handle json-value more generally though.
[18:40] jmar777: DavidIAm: right. express for example assumes anything that doesn't throw in JSON.parse() is acceptable
[18:40] felixge: rauchg: awesome, I'll ping you later then!
[18:40] jmar777: DavidIAm: which includes numbers, strings, booleans, etc.
[18:41] DavidIAm: jmar777 - Exactly.  I'd have written the rfc that way.
[18:41] DavidIAm: jmar777 - who is to say you don't just want to send 'true'.  people'll end up doing things like [true] - why make a list for only one element?
[18:42] DavidIAm: jmar777 - the point becomes moot when you use encapsulations like JSON-RPC, where every communication structure is by definition an object.
[18:42] DavidIAm: jmar777 - or the recurring { error: <errorstuff>, data: <nonerrorstuff> } type construct for intersystem communication to put errors out of band.
[18:43] mikeal has joined the channel
[18:43] jmar777: DavidIAm: right. although there are conceivably n-number of media types that could employ JSON in various ways. application/json just happens to be one of them

[18:45] nicki9knuckles has left the channel
[18:45] simenbrekken has joined the channel
[18:45] jn: im developing a cli tool using node. and it has a plugin system (different content handlers)
[18:45] jmar777: DavidIAm: alright, i'm gonna try and patch connect and hope tjholowaychuk sees it the same way :)
[18:45] jn: anyone have a idea of how to best load these plugins
[18:45] volkan has joined the channel
[18:45] DavidIAm: jmar777 - nothing but some time to lose there.
[18:46] jn: preferably if you could use npm to just install mytool-theplugin and have the clitool recognize that the plugin is avalible and load it
[18:46] jmar777: DavidIAm: i think his current assumption is that it's always a full serialized object, because middleware down stream treats it like the req.body will always be an object
[18:46] jn: is this possible
[18:46] DavidIAm: jmar777 - so if you make it an array it'll puke?
[18:47] DavidIAm: jn - sounds kind of like a .d directory.
[18:47] DavidIAm: jn - mytool/plugins.d/ where you toss markers for available installs.
[18:47] jmar777: DavidIAm: i think an array would work. on a string value it'll puke though
[18:48] jmar777: DavidIAm: after the bodyParser middleware, req.body will be a string value. the methodOverride middleware than uses in `in` statement against req.body, and that pukes
[18:48] felixhummel_ has joined the channel
[18:48] Vespakoen has joined the channel
[18:48] DavidIAm: jmar - sounds like a methodOverride issue for failing to check the content type?
[18:48] daglees has joined the channel
[18:48] daglees has joined the channel
[18:49] jmar777: DavidIAm: the methodOverride is supposed to work for any content type, so long as it has a top level "_method" value.
[18:49] jmar777: DavidIAm: so that test should fail for arrays or simple string values, but pass for any content type and body that can be parsed into a JavaScript object
[18:49] jn: DavidIAm: yeah. that would work. but can npm packages touch stuff outside it's own directory?
[18:50] hackband has joined the channel
[18:50] jmar777: DavidIAm: so there should be two fixes i think. one is that parsing on application/json should be RFC compliant and throw for string bodies
[18:50] skylamer` has joined the channel
[18:50] DavidIAm: jn - uhm... trying to remember waht I was reading about package.json
[18:50] jmar777: DavidIAm: and two would be the method override middleware should make sure req.body has actually been parsed to an object value
[18:50] DavidIAm: jn - I do know there's a 'bin' key that does things.  I seem to remember there was something about arbitrary files.
[18:51] DavidIAm: jmar777 - I could have used type text/json
[18:51] jmar777: DavidIAm: it can do whatever it wants in that case - there's no RFC, so who's to say what's right?
[18:51] jn: DavidIAm: yeah maybe i can scan the .bin/ directory for mytool-*
[18:51] DavidIAm: jn - you can do it in a script

[18:53] shipit_ has joined the channel
[18:53] DavidIAm: jn - what if you're not root?  can't put it in /etc.  What if somebody installed the core tool globally and the plugin locally?
[18:53] isaacs: jn: npm packages should not touch things outside their folder.
[18:54] DavidIAm: jmar777 - right.  it'd be a good idea not to have the middleware puke out doing an in on a non-object/array.
[18:54] isaacs: jn: it's better to just declare what your package has, and let npm manage everything outside of it
[18:54] jn: DavidIAm: yeah, i'm starting to think i want all logic in the clitool and keep the plugins dumb
[18:54] DavidIAm: I've seen nodejs code that recursively loads libraries by scanning the filesystem.
[18:55] mraleph has joined the channel
[18:55] DavidIAm: I think that's kind of messy.
[18:55] jn: isaacs: ah, perhaps i can list all packages with the npm package and look for a specific flag
[18:55] isaacs: jn: if you're thinking that you need to modify files outside your package, then you should probably back up and rethink the problem.
[18:55] jn: yeah, i'd rather not have to do that
[18:55] DavidIAm: jn - You might could put a special key/value piece in the package.json and scan the node path for those, parse and look for it.
[18:56] isaacs: it's a safe bet in such a situation, you're trying to do something that is too clever, and not really necessary.
[18:56] isaacs: any hacks you come up with are by definition brittle and unsupported.

[19:28] dob_: I tried different settings of max-old-space-size
[19:28] TooTallNate: tenshihan: did you use -g
[19:28] DavidIAm: it didn't say the system was out of memory.  :P
[19:28] dob_: but it did not work

[19:28] ben_alman: isaacs: in this case plugins can change the way the core behaves and as such need to be specified well ahead of time
[19:28] tenshihan: yess as per the readme
[19:29] TooTallNate: so it should already be available in your PATH
[19:29] TooTallNate: when you type: node-gyp
[19:29] TooTallNate: what do you see?
[19:29] tenshihan: no, i'm on windows 7 and it's path stingy
[19:29] tenshihan: node isn't even in path
[19:29] ben_alman: but i'll have to look at the idea of not auto-loading
[19:29] TooTallNate: well isaacs, where do global installs go on windows?
[19:29] ben_alman: just don't know if it's too late for that
[19:30] isaacs: TooTallNate: npm bin -g

[19:32] ben_alman: maxogden: any idea of how that might apply to fs.watch in Windows XP?
[19:32] ben_alman: seems… like i shouldn't be getting that error
[19:33] skylamer`: changing the os? :)
[19:33] jn: i really dont see why having autoloading plugins is a bad idea, it surley beats the alternative of having to manually load them every time i run
[19:33] ben_alman: i'm definitely not getting any errors using the same code in osx
[19:33] jn: ben_alman: send me a message if you ever find a good pattern for plugins :)
[19:33] skylamer`: i mean really
[19:33] maxogden: ben_alman: hmm not sure, do the tests pass?

[19:40] ben_alman: still trying to figure this out
[19:40] ningu: is node on windows generally kind of dodgy?

[19:41] ningu: I might be forced to develop some node stuff under windows
[19:41] ningu: :)
[19:41] TooTallNate: windows and osx these days have a nice "low-barrier" feel to them
[19:42] TooTallNate: mainly cause of the installers
[19:42] ningu: well, osx is fairly close to vanilla unix though, or can be
[19:42] mmalecki: windows is dodgy

[21:21] _rockbot_ has joined the channel
[21:21] felixge: rauchg: but wouldn't the client need to know the interval? (rather than the timeout which I assume would start ticking after an interval?)
[21:22] jimubao has joined the channel
[21:22] kevinliu: express.vhost works perfectly!
[21:23] hotchkiss has joined the channel
[21:23] rauchg: sure but the client can't expect a perfect world where the packets arrive precisely at interval
[21:23] rauchg: you would need some sort of multiplier
[21:23] rauchg: but it so happens that the ping timeout works very well as a multiplier already

[21:24] wink_: there is probably another copy running
[21:24] felixge: rauchg: ok, I think I'm missing how you define the interval / the timeout. Can you explain what each of them is supposed to do?
[21:25] rauchg: interval is how often the server sends a ping packet
[21:25] felixge: rauchg: Also: Just finished up and pushed the ActiveX patch I mentioned: https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io-client/pull/392
[21:25] rauchg: timeout is at which point the server considers the client disconnected
[21:25] rauchg: because it didn't get a ping packet
[21:25] felixge: rauchg: ok, so timeout always needs to be > interval?
[21:26] rauchg: transparent fix ftw!
[21:26] rauchg: yep
[21:26] felixge: rauchg: well, it seems currently the opposite is happening as a default: https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io/blob/master/lib/manager.js#L75

[21:26] rauchg: on the server its fine tho 
[21:26] rauchg: although i do want to change those defaults 
[21:27] jimubao has joined the channel
[21:27] rauchg: but for the client 
[21:27] rauchg: if it considered the interval 
[21:27] rauchg: as the timeout 
[21:27] napperjabber_ has joined the channel
[21:27] rauchg: it would never work 
[21:27] darrenlooby: wingie, cheers. How do I remove it? Do you know?
[21:27] rauchg: the server sends the packet in this case 
[21:27] rauchg: it expects it back from the client 
[21:27] rauchg: in 15 seconds
[21:27] darrenlooby: It's the first instance that I started of the same script.
[21:27] rauchg: and then in 20 seconds it does that again
[21:28] jimubao has joined the channel
[21:28] rauchg: the problem would be 
[21:28] rauchg: if the client said 
[21:28] rauchg: im expecting a ping packet
[21:28] rauchg: every 20 seconds
[21:28] rauchg: that would _not_ work
[21:28] felixge: rauchg: well, right now the client only knows the 15 second timeout
[21:28] felixge: it doesn't know the interval
[21:28] rauchg: right
[21:28] rauchg: and that's bad too 
[21:28] felixge: so I'm not sure how the client would be able to detect missing heartbeats from the server properly
[21:28] rauchg: because it would need a multiplier 
[21:28] felixge: yeah
[21:28] ksys has joined the channel
[21:29] rauchg: just because we have bad defaults
[21:29] rauchg: right now the server is too greedy
[21:29] rlidwka: darrenlooby: you have something that listens 8080 port...find out what it is or just change .listen(8080); to some another port
[21:29] rauchg: to consider someone disconnected
[21:29] rauchg: :D
[21:29] ksys: what function will print all object properties? including inherited ones
[21:29] rauchg: so let's change interval to 25s timeout to 60s
[21:29] rauchg: and send timeout 
[21:29] rauchg: and on the client
[21:29] jimubao has joined the channel
[21:29] rauchg: expect a ping packet every timeout
[21:29] darrenlooby: rlidwka, I've found it. And changed it to confirm. But, I don't know how to stop it. It's a node script that on that port.
[21:29] rauchg: seconds

[21:31] rauchg: what we have right now is definitely not terrible
[21:31] rauchg: but not optimal
[21:31] rauchg: and doesn't work for the client 
[21:31] rauchg: which is probably why it's gone in the client atm

[21:33] hotchkiss has joined the channel
[21:34] larsschenk1 has left the channel
[21:34] felixge: rauchg: yeah, but IMO clients should be able to figure out if they are disconnected
[21:34] rauchg: yep
[21:34] rauchg: absolutely
[21:34] felixge: so I'll get to work on a patch to look at tomorrow, just wanted to talk to you about this first

[21:36] felixge: (I've used ZeParser while hacking on Syntux: https://github.com/evilhackerdude/syntux )

[21:37] itayneeman: felixge: would be interesting to see if esprima would work well for syntux
[21:38] felixge: itayneeman: seems like it could work
[21:39] nuthinking: how can I debug how many connection a client has open with the server, I have problem with long poll and ajax
[21:39] felixge: itayneeman: but ZeParser works well enough :)
[21:39] felixge: itayneeman: it's fast, and it can take apart projects as complex as jQuery and put them back together while with the sha1 matching
[21:39] dberlinger has joined the channel
[21:39] itayneeman: felixge: fair enough. I switched Cover to use esprima this weekend (to do full code instrumentation), worked out pretty well.

[21:39] Eruadan has joined the channel
[21:39] felixge: itayneeman: yeah, but I think esprima is also good. Whatever

[21:40] felixge: itayneeman: with ZeParser I can ask Peter the author if something is broken - so free consulting wins :)
[21:40] itayneeman: felixge: fact!
[21:40] Eruadan: is there alternative frameworks for node other than express.js ?
[21:40] felixge: itayneeman: uglify is ok, but it's just not useful for anything more complex than minifying as the AST is not complete
[21:40] felixge: Eruadan: yeah, like a million
[21:41] Eruadan: o.O

[21:41] felixge: Eruadan: this site hackernews.com show cases at least one a day : )

[21:42] rauchg: what comment
[21:42] StanlySoManly: if i have a security requirement that I need to be listening in the right place to find out if Chris Lea's ubuntu packages may have been hacked/corrupted, that would be the user mailing list, correct? 
[21:43] rauchg: felixge
[21:43] rauchg: we can add as much as we want to the build process
[21:43] rlidwka: how can I get a list of subdirectories in specified directory?
[21:43] rlidwka: fs.readfile returns all files. Should I use fs.stat on every single file there to see if it's a folder? Or is there some better way?
[21:43] rauchg: another parser won't hurt

[21:43] dreamdust: Eruadan: Take a look at Connect which Express is built on. Honestly, I prefer rolling my own tools with Connect and borrow things from Express as needed.

[21:44] erikzaadi has joined the channel
[21:46] napperjabber has joined the channel
[21:46] Eruadan: felixge, hehe, tower.js is built on top of express. I know there's many frameworks around, but they are all based in express. That's what i was asking. Something based on Connect, similar to express.
[21:46] AvianFlu: StanlySoManly, if you have that requirement, compile from source
[21:46] felixge: Eruadan: they are not all based on express
[21:46] AvianFlu: and then make your own signed packages
[21:47] dreamdust: Unless you know your *exact* needs for the project, I wouldn't begin using a framework at all.
[21:47] felixge: dreamdust: that's stupid advise
[21:47] ben_alman: bnoordhuis: i wrote up a very detailed example of this fs.watch issue for you, this probably supercedes the previous issue https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/2839

[21:48] Eruadan: dreamdust, I'm a newbie, I have good knowledge of javascript, htl and css. So, i was thinking to get things that are already running, so i can learn frm it
[21:48] felixge: dreamdust: I'd say the less you know about a project, the more appropiate a framework is to get something to play with as quick as possible
[21:48] dreamdust: In that case, Express.js is probably the best fit since it's just the essentials.
[21:49] dreamdust: And very popular so there's lots of examples/docs
[21:49] StanlySoManly: AvianFlu: that kinda just pushes the problem back a level. if the source is corrupted, where would i listen to make sure that I'm not using an affect version? :)   naturally, I don't expect this to be a problem, but i should be able to react if it does happen. 
[21:50] Eruadan: dreamdust, that's what i was asking...beside express, is there any other software that does what express do?
[21:50] AvianFlu: StanlySoManly, no offense to chris lea, but I'd trust joyent's fileservers over his git repo
[21:50] maxogden: ben_alman: hmm maybe try also calling fs.unwatchFile(filename) in your unWatchFile function
[21:50] jldbasa has joined the channel
[21:50] AvianFlu: I'm sure there are ways to verify the source
[21:50] ben_alman: that seems really wonky
[21:51] maxogden: ben_alman: agreed, but it might work :)
[21:51] maxogden: ben_alman: im not sure what the difference is between watcher.close() and fs.unwatchFile()
[21:51] ben_alman: maxogden: https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/1eb1fe32250fc88cb5b0a97cddf3e02be02e3f4a/lib/fs.js#L766

[21:52] StanlySoManly: AvianFlu: totally understand and i see where you're coming from. so if i'm compiling from source and there's an exploit or a compromise, is the user mailing list still the  place to watch for those sorts of announcements?

[22:52] garrettwilkin: I've looked at them a bit
[22:52] garrettwilkin: seems like you're supposed to use the command

[22:52] garrettwilkin: as the module name
[22:52] garrettwilkin: but...
[22:52] itayneeman: in the module you want to make available
[22:52] garrettwilkin: in the code you require hookio?
[22:52] itayneeman: you do "npm link"
[22:52] garrettwilkin: right
[22:52] itayneeman: and in the place where you want to require it
[22:52] itayneeman: you do
[22:52] itayneeman: npm link hook.io
[22:52] garrettwilkin: right
[22:52] itayneeman: or whatever module name it is
[22:53] garrettwilkin: i guess that the fact that the name on the command line has the period
[22:53] itayneeman: you can try npm link "hook.io"

[23:12] tenshihan: npm install -g express

[23:12] tenshihan: however it crashes saying can't find module
[23:12] tenshihan: any clues?
[23:12] RLa: did you create app with express command?

[23:18] rlidwka: tenshihan: you can try to make directory "node_modules" and run "npm install express" (without -g) there
[23:18] RLa: tenshihan, did you execute npm install -d in your app directory?
[23:20] tenshihan: http://pastebin.com/YnwBuMX5
[23:20] brianseeders has joined the channel
[23:20] rlidwka: it's not an error, skip it
[23:21] rlidwka: i'm talking about this: Error: The "sys" module is now called "util"
[23:22] tenshihan: RLa: rlidwka: I attempted to do install -d and i got what is in that pastebin
[23:22] tenshihan: and when i attempt to do express /root/app to make an app
[23:22] tenshihan: it errors with Error: The "sys" module is now called "util".
[23:23] tenshihan: rlidwka:  not sure how to skpi it
[23:24] RLa: tenshihan, what is your node version?
[23:24] tenshihan: v.0.7.4
[23:24] tenshihan: err v.0.7.3
[23:25] itayneeman: v0.7.x is "experimental"
[23:25] itayneeman: you should use the stable 0.6.x versions
[23:25] tenshihan: oh
[23:25] itayneeman: when 0.6 shipped, they renamed sys to util
[23:25] itayneeman: and I believe when 0.8 ships, that error will be enforced
[23:25] tenshihan: good point
[23:25] itayneeman: 0.7 is the staging ground for 0.8
[23:25] itayneeman: hence you're getting the error
[23:26] itayneeman: but it also means that most package authors have not updated their packages yet
[23:26] tenshihan: can i file a bug report ?
[23:27] rlidwka: hm... requiring "sys" will throw an error in 0.8? I smell that a lot of packages will fail then...

[23:28] Jarred has joined the channel
[23:28] Jarred: What's usually lighter on memory, MySQL or MongoDB?
[23:29] Jarred: (and CPU footprint)
[23:29] Tobsn: depends on the data
[23:29] Tobsn: mongodb is heavy on ram but it only uses what is available
[23:29] zackattack has joined the channel
[23:29] Tobsn: but thats what makes it fast
[23:29] Tobsn: mysql can use a lot of ram if you set it to use a lot of ram
[23:29] gerard0 has joined the channel
[23:29] Tobsn: it depends on your cache settings, query cache, index cache etc.
[23:30] CoverSlide: 'sys' was deprecated since 0.5.x . any modules that are still using it probably suck anyway
[23:30] CoverSlide: if anything, just do a sed
[23:30] Jarred: hmm
[23:30] rlidwka: mysql imho is lighter by default, but this defaults can always be tweaked
[23:31] Jarred: alright, thanks
[23:31] Jarred: I'll go with MongoDB
[23:31] Jarred: actually
[23:31] Jarred: Why isn't PostgreSQL popular amongst people who do Node?
[23:32] itayneeman: isaacs: is NODE_MODULE_CONTEXTS still considered an "experiment"?
[23:32] rlidwka: I'm personally prefer NoSQL over SQL... and seems like it's not only me
[23:33] CoverSlide: in your opinion or actually based on experience?
[23:34] TooTallNate: itayneeman: yes, even more so now that the REPL has it *off* by default
[23:34] TooTallNate: (in 0.4.x is was on which was the only time it was relevant)
[23:34] Jarred: CoverSlide: I'm not sure if you're talking to me or rlidwka. From what I've seen so far, there are a lot more ORMs for MongoDB and MySQL for Node than there are for PostgreSQL
[23:34] itayneeman: TooTallNate: do you think it will ever make a comeback?
[23:34] itayneeman: TooTallNate: the main question is whether modules can depend on shared globals or not
[23:35] itayneeman: itayneeman: for example, I know that mocha pretty heavily uses it, and I'm considering it as well
[23:35] Cromulent has joined the channel
[23:35] itayneeman: wow, I just sent a message to myself
[23:35] TooTallNate: itayneeman: i don't think it'll make a comeback, however the preferred method is to just expose your module as a function
[23:35] RLa: orm makes no sense for mongo since there is no "relations" :)
[23:35] TooTallNate: a function that accepts whatever globals/dependencies you are going to work with
[23:35] itayneeman: TooTallNate: I agree, but there are always edge cases (for example, in my case, code coverage information collection)
[23:36] TooTallNate: what do you mean?
[23:36] CrypticSwarm has joined the channel
[23:37] Vespakoen has joined the channel
[23:37] itayneeman: TooTallNate: in my case, I'm instrumenting every file that is required, and when the process is about to exit, I'd like to collect all that coverage information. With shared globals, I could just put all the information in a global variable, and access it on exit. Without shared globals, I'd need to do somethign more complex
[23:38] itayneeman: TooTallNate: did that make any sense?
[23:39] TooTallNate: itayneeman: why not have one "main" file, which has an Array of required files, and an on('exit') handler
[23:39] TooTallNate: and then add to that Array for each file when it gets required
[23:39] itayneeman: TooTallNate: that's fine, but how do I access the instrumented information? Imagine that for each line in a file, I add an expresion like "__coverage[filename][lineNum]++"
[23:39] Vespakoen has left the channel
[23:39] TooTallNate: you can always just require some hidden module that holds your "shared" state
[23:39] itayneeman: I need to access that __coverage variable for each file

[23:40] jesster7 has left the channel

[23:40] itayneeman: TooTallNate: though you might be right that i can require a hidden module that will give me back the __coverage object

[23:41] TooTallNate: itayneeman: yes, that would be the
[23:41] TooTallNate: "module-y"

[23:41] reid has joined the channel

[23:43] itayneeman: I forked runforcover
[23:43] itayneeman: because I hads ome issues wiht it
[23:43] isaacs: itayneeman: to answer your question, if it resolves to the same file, yes, you get the same module.
[23:43] konobi: it's used in node-tap too
[23:43] isaacs: itayneeman: i too found it a bit more alpha than i'd like.
[23:43] itayneeman: including the fact that it woudl codegen some bad code (I believe this was uglifies fault)

[23:44] garrettwilkin: also
[23:44] itayneeman: For most frameworks though you dont even need to do that

[23:44] itayneeman: you can just
