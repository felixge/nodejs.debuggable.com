[00:26] isaacs: innociv: that's not odd.  it's just that you have a terminal that doesn't support unicode

[00:27] innociv: isaacs, i was getting an error saying socket.io wasn't installed when trying the socket.io example.
[00:27] isaacs: innociv: there ya go
[00:27] Skyec: isaacs: i mean, i've got code in my js file, but it doesn't seem to be getting called
[00:28] innociv: But now it works.
[00:28] isaacs: Skyec: gist the code
[00:28] joshkehn: Skyec: Can you share the code?
[00:28] jakl: what version of node are you useing for your socket.io setup?
[00:28] isaacs: innociv: i'm teling you, though, you should totally get a unicode-supporting terminal font.  it's way prettier :)
[00:29] innociv: ACTION nods
[00:30] Skyec: oh, I think I know what it is
[00:30] cconstantine: When I create an EventEmitter and throw from within a listener I lose all current listeners: http://pastebin.com/7xm9dUKg   is there anyway around this?
[00:30] innociv: http://socket.io/#how-to-use In this first example, where should index.html be located?
[00:30] Skyec: I'm using process.exit() to stop execution, but i don't think just kills node right off

[00:50] simoon: I think thats the only solution I can see too atm

[00:51] mike5w3c has joined the channel
[00:51] innociv: But what is setting that line?  How can Iget it to be the ip instead of localhost? 
[00:52] micheil: there's likely to be an host setting for socket.io, as to what that is, I wouldn't know.
[00:54] innociv: Would really think they'd cover hosting outside of localhost in their example.
[00:55] innociv: It's getting the port right, but is using localhost instead of the ip.

[01:01] micheil: innociv: if you just need socket.io, I'm curious as to why you'd want to go that route rather than outsource it

[01:01] micheil: (disclaimer, I do work for a company that provide a hosted service doing exactly that)
[01:01] micheil: as in, why do you want to use socket.io?
[01:01] lz: hahaha
[01:02] micheil: iz: ?
[01:02] innociv: Because I have my own server already.  Setting up node doesn't seem terribly difficult.
[01:03] micheil: okay

[01:06] codely: hey everyone. i'm at the point now where i'm super comfortable in node, writing lots of modules etc. i wanted an 'expert opinion' - if i have a form for a user, where the background data need not have a callback (I'm hitting an API HARRRDDDDD) regardless of async its going to need a little bit of time.
[01:06] codely: should i just process.emit? to call my data parsing worker?
[01:06] innociv: All that's on the client is that tiny bit of html. http://pastebin.com/VAxTcurV  It appears that /socket.io/socket.io.js appaneds that <script />

[03:13] wibby: Hi, I'm looking for a beginner's guide to express with mongoose. so far, I haven't really found anything good. something that goes into details of mongodb and how to set it up, how to do the connection, how to store something permanently and what to consider if you want your expose your app to the public internet

[03:16] marcello3d: mongodb.org docs are pretty good, but dense, haven't really explored others
[03:17] innociv: What should I do if I need multiple channels with socket.io?   Should I be using https://github.com/aaronblohowiak/Push-It ?
[03:17] SubStack: maxogden: #stackvm will do for that
[03:18] innociv: Doesn't look like it's on the npm. :(

[03:44] innociv: I see a node_modules in $HOME/local/node/lib/node_modules/npm
[03:44] innociv: I don't see where socket.io is in there, nor push-it.
[03:44] tjholowaychuk: shanebo it's per connect app
[03:44] tjholowaychuk: in-memory
[03:45] tjholowaychuk: (currently at least)
[03:45] tjholowaychuk: I'd like to make it extensible so one could use redis etc to back the cache
[03:45] tjholowaychuk: not a huge priority though
[03:45] joshkehn: innociv: It should be in the folder you ran npm install
[03:46] joshkehn: If you do something like
[03:46] joshkehn: cd ~ && mkdir tmp && cd tmp && npm install socket.io
[03:46] innociv: ah
[03:46] innociv: yes i see now
[03:46] joshkehn: You should have a node_modules folder in /tmp/
[03:46] joshkehn: So 
[03:46] innociv: yeah it's right there at $HOME/node_modules. I'm blind 
[03:46] joshkehn: :)

[03:50] innociv: Is something like Push-It going to perform better than me simply maintaining arrays of users for each channel and emitting to that array of users/

[03:52] innociv: I'm surprised socket.io doesn't already have pub/sub functionality.

[12:47] innociv: topics are a child of a board, so when someone subs to a topic it should change the "v" property of the topic within the boards object, and that emit('activetopics', ...) should list all the topics there.  It's just empty though.  I don't see why.

[13:26] Glenjamin: exposing an HTTP API is probably a good option
[13:26] innociv: glenjamin, somewhat regularly.  Not as often as heartbeats and such.  And JSON data, probably.
[13:26] aconbere has joined the channel
[13:27] Glenjamin: then yeah, http is probably the way to go
[13:27] EyePulp: innociv: in the end there are a bunch of ways to slice it, but if you wrap the data up @ your source, and encrypt it, then send it via https, and decrypt on the other side, possibly with hash values verified on a per-send basis (e.g. your destination goes back to your source and says did you just send this?) you can have a semi reasonable level of confidence.
[13:28] EyePulp: but http/https is just as effective as anything for the pipe.  You can always create an ssh tunnel between the two boxes for additional protection.
[13:29] innociv: There is no secret data that should be in there an require encrypting.    Let me explain this way:  I want to allow other servers to publish data through my node.js server, but only allow certain servers and not just anyone who can see what data is expected.
[13:30] innociv: What should I look at for the receiving end of code?

[13:30] EyePulp: a lighter route - have a pre-agreed hash routine that consists of a few factors (some fixed, some changing) and send the hash along with the data.
[13:31] innociv: Can't I just go by the ip of the server sending the data?  Server ip's are static.  Or can someone fake that?..

[13:32] jscheel has joined the channel
[13:32] EyePulp: e.g. hash =  yyyy-dd-mm + hostname/ip_of_source_in_request_header + salt + hash_of_actual_data
[13:32] EyePulp: and assign unique salt to each host that wants to send you stuff
[13:33] JasonJS: If you are dealing with peoples PII or confidential info IP you probably want more then just IP
[13:33] innociv: That doesn't seem any more secure than just using the ip or a static hash if the sending code is open source.
[13:33] EyePulp: and IP's change.  Even "static" ones when your Datacenter gets bought out or buys someone else out.
[13:34] innociv: And no, nothing confidential being sent.  No passwords, no credit card information, no emails, etc.  People could just spam fake messages that shouldn't exist.
[13:34] innociv: Which.. can certainly be an issue.
[13:34] EyePulp: innociv: you aren't being very clear on the role your sources play, and what qualifies them to send you things.
[13:35] level09 has joined the channel

[13:37] innociv: I'm writing something in php that's open source, but for extra functionally(streaming data), I'll have them able to rent my node.js server.  So, I have to be able to authenticate that their server should communicate to mine both for that paid for functionality, and to make sure no one is trying to send fake data to deface that part of their site.
[13:37] mendel_ has joined the channel
[13:38] JasonJS: So when they purchase this extra functionality they will need to provide you an IP that the server will reside at?
[13:38] mbrevoort has joined the channel
[13:38] innociv: Someone posts something on their site, their php auths it, sends to my server, my server sends to everyone on that page.  If dynamic functionality, users would have to refresh to grab an updated static page.

[13:39] JasonJS: It's a simple solution (ie: quick to implement) that has a few shortcomings but should be fine for your needs. You can always expand it in the future if you find abuses.
[13:40] innociv: Oh.  I'd just need to give each person their own salt I think.

[13:41] nuck has joined the channel
[13:41] innociv: yeah
[13:41] innociv: Basically like EyePulp said, but make sure the salt is different for each server, since the server code is open source.
[13:42] innociv: Should work..
[13:42] JasonJS: I would try to use https at least so the salt isn't transmitted plaintext
[13:42] c4milo has joined the channel
[13:42] thomblake has joined the channel
[13:42] sfoster has joined the channel
[13:43] EyePulp: the salt should be part of a hash, and thus never transmitted
[13:43] thomblake has left the channel
[13:43] JasonJS: Ideally, yes, but I'm thinking he's just wanting a quick and dirty solution
[13:44] EyePulp: then the salt is meaningless.
[13:44] innociv: Just the hash would be received, nothing sent from my server to theirs.   Their salt would be given for the install/configure on them renting the dynamic functionality, I guess. so basically an http request of json data like {'hash':saltydynamicthing,'data'{}}, and I maintain a list of what salt is for each ip on my SSJS?
[13:44] EyePulp: it's not salt at that point, it's just a password sent across the wire.
[13:44] innociv: Salt wouldn't be exposed in a transaction.
[13:44] JasonJS: Yes
[13:44] EyePulp: innociv: exactly
[13:44] Oi has joined the channel
[13:45] EyePulp: the salt is there to make the hash uniquely computed, but never to be sent as plaintext
[13:45] Oi has left the channel
[13:46] JasonJS: The only way to map a salt to a packet would be IP though with what we are discussing here
[13:46] EyePulp: people who are paying you money will have an account with you, so it should be easy enough to store an additional bit of info - make sure your salt is not == a userID or some other thing that's sent across the wire or part of urls 
[13:46] innociv: What do I need to google to look at for the receiving end of code on my node.js?  I can probably do the sending with php file_get_contents()
[13:46] JasonJS: Which will cause problems if you have 2 installs in a virtual host environment
[13:47] JasonJS: Eye: exactly
[13:47] JasonJS: inno: that should be fine
[13:47] Glenjamin: innociv: the algorithm, can be as simple as sha1(sha1(time)+salt)
[13:48] innociv: yeah i could just send a unixtime with the json, and the key to compare being a salted hash of that.
[13:48] Glenjamin: or you can do challenge->handshake: client->server(req)->client(token)->server(hash of token+salt)
[13:48] stash1 has joined the channel
[13:49] EyePulp: The IP is meaningless, if you make the salt/hash the identifier.  It makes maintenance for them and you much simpler.  Something's hacked?  change your salt. they have the new salt?  Fix your leaky server, mr. customer.
[13:49] hnan has joined the channel
[13:49] Glenjamin: client requests a token from server, combines it with salt and hashes, then makes the real request
[13:49] RORgasm has joined the channel
[13:49] EyePulp: Glenjamin: I suggested that early on, but no one bit.
[13:49] EyePulp: =)
[13:49] innociv: yeah.  It's the customers fault if someone has access to their server to view the salt.
[13:49] Glenjamin: thats how i've done this in the past
[13:49] Glenjamin: alternatively, try an existing solution like Oauth
[13:50] innociv: Oauth hurt my brain.
[13:50] Glenjamin: which i think is designed for this sort of thing
[13:50] Glenjamin: hell, you could just only expose the interface over HTTPS and use basic auth
[13:50] slifty has joined the channel
[13:50] innociv: What do you mean there?
[13:50] EyePulp: This is feeling like a case of premature optimization.
[13:50] Glenjamin: you know HTTP basic auth, the password prompt thing
[13:51] devongovett has joined the channel
[13:51] Glenjamin: when you do that over HTTPS, you get encryption for "free"
[13:52] innociv: Even if I used SSL, I can't just take someones word for it because if they see the source they know what is expected.  I need keys verified.
[13:52] noodlehaus has joined the channel
[13:52] innociv: But.. it would be better if a connection is made between their server and mine once, rather than every single message having a hash verified.
[13:52] joshkehn has joined the channel

[13:53] xDelph: hello world

[13:55] meso has joined the channel

[13:55] noodlehaus: hi guys, can anyone recommend any form validation library for express?

[13:57] chjj: xDelph: im guessing youre referring to the error message you get when you bind more than 10 listeners?
[13:57] noodlehaus: hi guys, can anyone recommend any form validation library for express?
[13:57] xDelph: warning: possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 11 listeners added. Use emitter.setMaxListeners() to increase limit.
[13:57] chjj: the solution is to not bind so many listeners
[13:58] xDelph: i need this listeners
[13:58] xDelph: ...
[13:58] Glenjamin: or do what it says and use emitter.setMaxListeners to be higher
[13:58] chjj: xDelph: okay, well then ignore the error message
[13:58] JasonJS: xDelph: it's just a warning - you can increase the limit if you actually need more then 10
[13:58] chjj: if you know what theyre for, go ahead and use them, that message is just a general warning, its actually saved me a couple times
[13:58] xDelph: i try to do it, but even i increase the limit to 30, the warning is always here
[13:59] xDelph: and i know to solve this because it is write to a log file
[13:59] xDelph: i msut *
[13:59] xDelph: must *
[13:59] noodlehaus has left the channel
[13:59] JasonJS: Does you app require that many active listeners?
[14:00] xDelph: yes, because my app is a game :)
[14:00] EagleCoder has joined the channel
[14:00] chjj: then set maxListeners to Infinity, and ignore the message
[14:00] JasonJS: Then just increase the max listeners
[14:00] JasonJS: What chjj said
[14:00] JasonJS: :)
[14:00] xDelph: this don't work (setMaxListeners(0) or setMaxListeners(30))

[14:10] Aikar: its been there on the past few versions
[14:11] jorenl_ has joined the channel
[14:11] JasonJS: It was added so that people realized when many listeners were being added to an emitter. It's just a nudge to make you check that it is what you expected vs. a leak.

[14:11] JasonJS: It's pretty easy to mistakenly keep adding listeners without cleaning up your old ones.

[14:16] Aikar: jquery is pretty light... wouldnt hurt to just load it anyways, and im sure if your doing anything using ajax youll be needing other features of jquery

[14:22] deadman87: JasonSmith, http://www.openjs.com/scripts/jx/
[14:22] deadman87: :)
[14:23] deadman87: Jx provides the most basic Ajax support. It is striped down to minimise file size - so it will not support many advanced features. You can pass data to the server side script using the GET method only. The supported return types are plain text and JSON. It does NOT support XML return.

[15:06] jaequery has joined the channel

[15:07] netlemur: JasonJS, ah, thanks
[15:07] skiz has joined the channel
[15:07] netlemur: so i can use cluster on each server and do the multiple server stuff with nginx, ha-proxy and stuff like that?
[15:07] JasonJS: Yup

[15:08] netlemur: someone tried node-http-proxy? is it any good?

[15:08] MrNibbles: netlemur: what are you planning on using it for?
[15:08] mklappstuhl: Glenjamin: There is now json showing up in my browser thouhg
[15:08] micheil: netlemur: Joyent use node-http-proxy on their no.de service, and Nodejitsu use it it production
[15:09] Glenjamin: netlemur: i'd still just run one node process per code with forever, then load balance per box with nginx
[15:09] Glenjamin: s/code/core/
[15:09] micheil: netlemur: it's pretty battle tested, but I'd read the source code first, as there's a few configuration gotchas
[15:09] netlemur: thanks
[15:09] vipaca: Is there an efficient way to resize a buffer?
[15:10] micheil: vipaca: no, as Buffers are almost a direct mapping to C's mem alloc functions
[15:10] netlemur: MrNibbles, nothing specific yet. Just want to know what's possible. For my current app one server is more then enough
[15:11] Poetro has joined the channel
[15:11] MrNibbles: netlemur: fair enough
[15:12] bronson: matwill, curious, how did you hear about strata
[15:12] netlemur: Glenjamin, serving static content through nginx sounds good.. but why not use cluster for the rest? big performance reason? sounds like more configuration than necessary
[15:12] bronson: ?

[15:12] matwill: bronson: hacker news http://news.ycombinator.org/item?id=3021564

[15:38] DrMcKay: pyrotechnick: I'm actually not sure, I'm doing it for the first time
[15:39] pyrotechnick: yeah i think its at the start bro
[15:39] pyrotechnick: so like
[15:39] DrMcKay: r04r: I run gitosis on my server, but it has no ui
[15:39] Aikar: that test isnt equal
[15:39] pyrotechnick: your first ones running a million times and making a fuckoff huge array
[15:39] zastaph has joined the channel
[15:39] pyrotechnick: and the second has to use the fuckoff huge array for its test
[15:39] pyrotechnick: so it crashes

[15:42] Glenjamin: DrMcKay: these 2 are not the same operation

[15:43] pyrotechnick: Glenjamin: why not?
[15:43] CoverSlide: concat returns a new array

[15:43] pyrotechnick: this is how you always see it written
[15:43] pyrotechnick: this is what they do
[15:43] pyrotechnick: a = a.concat something
[15:43] Glenjamin: i've never seen that
[15:43] pyrotechnick: i see it daily
[15:44] DrMcKay: Glenjamin, CoverSlide: that's the point, I wanted to compare the sneaky way and the stupid way

[15:46] stelleg has joined the channel
[15:46] pyrotechnick: you're missing the point
[15:46] CoverSlide: concat creates a copy of the original array. I would assume this is slower

[15:46] pyrotechnick: that is how it's always used
[15:47] pyrotechnick: i know what you're saying, trust me, i get it
[15:47] pyrotechnick: it's stupid, it's different, but it's what people do all of the time

[15:48] DrMcKay: well, even jquery uses concat
[15:48] pyrotechnick: tell me it couldnt be made alot faster with the alternate method
[15:48] pyrotechnick: i know
[15:48] pyrotechnick: thats what i was saying
[15:48] pyrotechnick: EVERYONE does it

[15:49] pyrotechnick: CoverSlide: the test was broken
[15:50] pyrotechnick: CoverSlide: its fixed now
[15:50] Glenjamin: pyrotechnick: point taken, but unless it actually comes up as a hotspot, the point is moot
[15:50] pyrotechnick: Glenjamin: this is a webgl engine mate
[15:50] pyrotechnick: that code gets run 60 times a second at least
[15:50] Glenjamin: then optimise it!
[15:50] pyrotechnick: yep
[15:50] Glenjamin: but that doesn't mean every use of concat ever has to be changed to array.prototype
[15:50] pyrotechnick: i havent used that construct in mine yet, but i will patch the crap out of three.js

[15:51] r04r: Aikar: Will do, thanks
[15:51] Aikar: r04r: I use gitosis for self hosted repos, its soooooo easy to install, and requires no daemon (its all powered by git hooks... so sweet). I know you said web interface, git-web provides that but it is pretty basic
[15:51] Eber: Glenjamin: uhm, right! thanks!
[15:52] Aikar: r04r: you setup 1 user (pref git) on your box, install gitosis on it, and then your users authenticate with SSH keys, and able to control read/write permissions on a user/group level. 
[15:52] Glenjamin: you can use process.nextTick to release the loop every now and then if needed
[15:52] Glenjamin: Aikar: r04r https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite is like gitosis, but newer, better maintained and documented
[15:53] Aikar: oh right i remember i was going to look at that
[15:53] Glenjamin: it can also do more finely grained permissions
[15:53] DrMcKay: wait, shit, what am I running? it could be gitolite actually

[16:11] sveisvei has joined the channel
[16:12] r04r: DrMcKay: I get how async helps, but I thought scalability meant putting multiple servers behind a load balancer or something. 
[16:12] CoverSlide: that would help,
[16:12] CoverSlide: but asynchronous IO is a much more efficient way of doing it
[16:13] r04r: CoverSlide: Gotcha
[16:13] Aikar: r04r: generally does. i think its more meant to say its easier to build a scalable system with node than many other langs. since you can do many things much more effeciently in node
[16:13] herbySk has joined the channel
[16:14] CoverSlide: i mean you can still load balance multiple node servers, lots of people do that too
[16:14] r04r: Aikar: Ah, that makes sense. I was just wondering if there was some node magic that I missed regarding this
[16:14] akujin- has joined the channel
[16:14] Aikar: using node doesnt magically make your app scalable, and other languages can be scalable. its just the effort to do so is diff per environment
[16:14] slifty has joined the channel
[16:14] Glenjamin: r04r: it's a combination of this: http://krondo.com/?p=1209 (the reactor pattern), and v8's JIT compilation
[16:15] CoverSlide: classically, most servers choose to spawn a new thread per connection, but that's much more overhead
[16:15] Aikar: r04r: nope, and node even has its own pitfall that you have to get around that you dont in other langs: its single threaded, so paralellizing work over multiple cores is a problem you have to solve (which is easy with many modules already written)

[16:51] spolu: Hi there, I have a small question about v8 GC: I have a large v8 heap (in memory search type of workload), I receive a few message from the network that do not generally impact any object of my heap but trigger a mark-sweep / mark-compact that takes forever.
[16:51] Nuck|mobile has joined the channel
[16:51] spolu: (> 1s)
[16:51] spolu: I was wondering if it was possible to influence the GC behavior to reduce the number of mark-sweep / mark-compact to an acceptable level
[16:52] spolu: or should I just implement my C++ module to put those object out of v8 heap?
[16:52] DrMcKay: spolu: I'm not a V8 expert, but I believe it got fixed in very recent revision
[16:52] Glenjamin: they're still working on a new GC afaik
[16:52] spolu: yep
[16:52] Glenjamin: spolu: if thats an option, i'd do so
[16:52] Glenjamin: since that keeps you safe from the heap limit too
[16:53] bnoordhuis: spolu: if possible, stay out of v8
[16:53] bnoordhuis: spolu: stuff like HandleScope can trigger the gc
[16:53] spolu: Glenjamin: that's what I was thinking… kind of wanted to delay that dev… but I can't afford 1s block every few seconds
[16:53] sivy has left the channel
[16:53] spolu: bnoordhuis: what do you mean by HandleScope can trigger the gc?
[16:53] Glenjamin: yeah, over about 600MB the GC cycles are a bit long
[16:53] spolu: Glenjamin: yup :)
[16:54] Glenjamin: we restart our process at > 550MB to keep our in-mem cache useful
[16:54] nuck_ has joined the channel
[16:55] bnoordhuis: spolu: say you have a c++ callback that declares a HandleScope variable
[16:55] davidwalsh has joined the channel
[16:55] bnoordhuis: spolu: when that variable goes out of scope, it may trigger a gc run
[16:55] spolu: bnoordhuis: ok! but if it's out of heap, no pb with that.

[17:07] langworthy has joined the channel
[17:08] hoodoos: hello, guys! is there any good resource with an explanation of proper timeouts handling of http request? my problem here is that if I run 2 concurrent requests for same website it seem to produce only one socket for 2 http requests. but timeout event is fired for socket, not for request. so it's quite hard and not very straight forward to handle..
[17:08] hoodoos: kmiyashiro, what kind of web API you mean?
[17:09] tjholowaychuk: kmiyashiro i think a lotttt of people have
[17:09] kmiyashiro: so
[17:09] kmiyashiro: I'm trying to figure out if it's easy to have a "fields" param
[17:09] kmiyashiro: and then that fields param tells the API which fields to return in the response
[17:09] cpetzold has joined the channel
[17:09] kmiyashiro: and similarly, an "exclude_fields" param, to exclude certain fields
[17:09] kmiyashiro: is that easy?
[17:09] tjholowaychuk: like this https://github.com/lloyd/JSONSelect
[17:09] tjholowaychuk: ?
[17:09] kmiyashiro: and if so, how easy?
[17:10] kmiyashiro: ehh
[17:10] kmiyashiro: kinda
[17:10] tjholowaychuk: not sure what you're referring to as fields
[17:10] kmiyashiro: but I'd rather not filter it out
[17:10] hoodoos: very abstract task you described :)
[17:10] kmiyashiro: in JSON, they would be certain keys
[17:10] kmiyashiro: xml, tags
[17:10] kmiyashiro: I assume
[17:10] kmiyashiro: it would just modify the db select call
[17:11] kmiyashiro: but, not sure if it's that simple
[17:11] kmiyashiro: or if content filtering is easier
[17:11] kmiyashiro: for example, the NYTimes API lets you select which fields to return: http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/read/article_search_api#h2-responses

[17:37] bnoordhuis: the idea being that if you trash /lib and /usr/lib, the stuff in /sbin will still work

[17:37] bnoordhuis: no, it's a remnant of the past now

[17:38] bnoordhuis: DrMcKay: see above
[17:38] isaacs: in that case, npm should really live in bin, not sbin

[18:29] Twisol: Yeah.

[18:33] chapel: so I can't really help you with them specifically
[18:33] cups: hey guys has anyone had any experience trying to compile css less files with the windows node.js executable?  
[18:34] Twisol: The salient point is that I can't upload the node_modules/ directory, so I need to find other ways to tell npm where to find my module
[18:34] chapel: so heroku just wont let you? that seems odd imo
[18:34] cups: I tried including node in my environment vars, then when I try node parser.js I get the following error:  cannot find module 'less/tree'
[18:34] devaholic: hey chapel
[18:34] MatthewS has joined the channel
[18:34] chance-: @Twisol it seems like heroku would handle the node_modules in the same manner that it handles gems
[18:35] chance-: no?
[18:35] deedubs_ has joined the channel
[18:35] CoinOpeBoy has joined the channel
[18:35] Twisol: In the guide it says to add node_modules to .gitignore, and "Make sure that all of your app�s dependencies are declared in package.json and that you are not relying on any system-level packages."
[18:35] chance-: that makes sense
[18:35] Twisol: chance-: I expect so, but Ruby has a way to specify local paths
[18:35] chance-: so it does handle them like gems then
[18:35] chapel: yo devaholic

[18:37] devaholic: yeah

[18:40] Twisol: It's fine. If all else fails I can just throw my vendor/ subfolder into require.paths
[18:40] AphelionZ has joined the channel
[18:41] Twisol: the only thing npm does for me here is put the module in node_modules, which is already in require.paths

[18:43] mikedeboer has joined the channel
[18:44] cups: anyone ever compile less with windows version of node.js? :)
[18:44] Twisol: chance-: I have a module that's not on the npm repositories or on GitHub, and I need to bundle it with my app to host on Heroku
[18:44] devaholic: Twisol: sounds like you should put it in lib/vendor and set up your require as ./lib/vendor and forget it was ever an npm module
[18:44] Twisol: chance-: Heroku doesn't want you uploading a node_modules/ directory, so I can't just put it in there
[18:44] Twisol: devaholic: That's what I was thinking, yeah.
[18:44] Twisol: er
[18:44] devaholic: thats the way to do it
[18:44] Twisol: you mean directly require it as require("./lib/vendor")?
[18:45] devaholic: plus the name of the module
[18:45] chance-: yea.. that sounds like the right approach on my end as well
[18:45] Twisol: eh, I was hoping to avoid the ./
[18:45] Twisol: hence adding vendor/ to require.paths
[18:45] devaholic: i dont see any reason why you should avoid ./
[18:45] chance-: is there a way to specify additional repositories or sources in npm?
[18:45] chance-: via a config?
[18:45] Twisol: to me, it shows what code is part of the app and what isn't
[18:46] chance-: i mean if there were.. you could do it that way
[18:46] devaholic: thats why it's in vendor
[18:46] Twisol: chance-: I looked, but apparently it's just version strings or URLs
[18:46] devaholic: not everything is on npm
[18:46] Twisol: chance-: and the URL has to point to a tarball
[18:46] chance-: @twisol ah, i see
[18:47] Twisol: oh, I remember why I needed to have npm do this
[18:47] parshap has joined the channel
[18:47] Twisol: it has native code
[18:47] chance-: eek
[18:47] Twisol: :D
[18:47] nuck: tjholowaychuk: There any way to pass a variable into res.render inside a middleware, so I can set session to req.session on all pages?
[18:47] tjholowaychuk: nuck yeah do res.local('session', req.session)
[18:48] nuck: tjholowaychuk: Sweet, thanks :D
[18:48] nuck: Figured out compiler, it's horribly hard to control
[18:48] chance-: twisol, sounds like you need to setup some form of repo, wrap it up in a tarball, and point to it through it's url
[18:49] Twisol: chance-: Yeah, but it's an internal package that I don't really feel like putting online.
[18:49] tjholowaychuk: nuck it's just not flexible enough for things like less/stylus
[18:49] tjholowaychuk: stuff like jade/markdown it's fine
[18:49] devaholic: what is native code preventing you from doing?
[18:49] Twisol: devaholic: It needs to be compiled when I push the project to Heroku
[18:50] chrissanz has joined the channel
[18:50] nuck: tjholowaychuk: It's a nice idea, and if you didn't have to set dest and src, it'd be perfect.
[18:50] devaholic: i'm not exactly sure how heroku deployment works, but why cant you just require what you need as per usual?
[18:51] chrissanz has left the channel
[18:51] chance-: @devaholic they handle the bundling themselves
[18:51] chrissanz has joined the channel
[18:51] chance-: @devaholic you push via git, they build out everything, and walla
[18:52] chance-: at least that's how it works with rails, I'm assuming the same applies to node
[18:52] chapel: Twisol: I think your best option at this point, is to bundle it as a tarball, host it on a url you control, and put that into the package.json
[18:52] chance-: i havent deployed a node app yet
[18:52] chapel: not optimal
[18:52] chapel: but you really don't have a choice if you have to use npm

[18:55] devaholic: twisol can you use git submodules with heroku?

[18:55] bradleymeck: anyone know why in an init.d script start_daemon might not end/return?
[18:55] tmcw has joined the channel
[18:55] Twisol: devaholic: Not sure. If you could, it would still have to pull the submodule repo from somewhere online
[18:56] devaholic: well you could put it up separately at least... or if it is on github
[18:56] devaholic: dunno 
[18:56] Twisol: Yeah, that's the catch, I don't want to put it online :D
[18:56] isaacs: Twisol: so, why not just put the code in your repo?  not getting it...
[18:57] isaacs: can you specify some kind of "on installation" script with heroku?
[18:58] Twisol: isaacs: I don't think so. As far as I can tell, it just runs npm when you deploy to fetch your dependencies.
[18:58] aron_ has joined the channel
[18:58] Twisol: I could be wrong, of course. I just don't see it anywhere in the docs
[18:59] Twisol: to summarize the issue again: I have a private package that contains native code, and I need to tell npm where to find it so that it can install and compile when Heroku does its thing
[18:59] csanz_ has joined the channel
[18:59] bergie has joined the channel
[18:59] isaacs: Twisol: whati'm saying is, put the source in your repo.  then, have a preinstall or something that cd's into there, and does `node-waf compile build` or whateverd
[19:00] Twisol: A preinstall on the package.json of my app itself?
[19:00] isaacs: sure, i mean, if heroku runs those.
[19:00] isaacs: ask them :)
[19:00] isaacs: "How do I set up my repo so that a script i specify will be run on installation?"
[19:00] Twisol: Alright, I'll figure something out. Thanks :)
[19:00] isaacs: np
[19:00] Twisol: Quick question if you don't mind
[19:00] Twisol: you maintain NPM, right?
[19:00] isaacs: Twisol: if they're running `npm install`, then `preinstall` is the thing you want
[19:00] isaacs: yeah, that's me :)
[19:01] chance-: Twistol: if they give you a positive answer, I'd like to hear it.. pre-install scripts could be useful
[19:01] Twisol: Is there any particular reason npm doesn't support local paths for dependencies?
[19:02] chance-: because node is young and noone has run into this problem yet? or at least noone that has been willing to add it/request it? :)

[19:06] Me1000 has joined the channel
[19:06] Twisol: isaacs: actual question asked above, in case you missed it
[19:06] isaacs: yeah, mostly because of the hazards of publishing things that aren't available off of your machine
[19:07] isaacs: Twisol: i would be ok with doing it, if we could have teh read-json.js also add a "private": true when it finds local file deps
[19:07] Twisol: What if it was always relative to the app folder?
[19:07] isaacs: if it's in your app folder, then why not just make it a bundledDependency, and not have to install it at all?
[19:08] Twisol: isaacs: does that assume that it's in .node_modules?
[19:08] isaacs: put it in node_modules/foo, "dependencies": {"foo":<version>}, "bundleDependencies":["foo"]
[19:08] isaacs: yeah
[19:08] Twisol: Can't do that because of Heroku
[19:08] isaacs: what's wrong with that?  i do that a lot
[19:08] dgathright_ has joined the channel
[19:08] isaacs: does heroku forcibly remove your node_modules folder?
[19:08] Twisol: it doesn't want you to push your .node_modules folder up
[19:08] isaacs: really?
[19:08] Twisol: I think it does, but it's been a while since i tried
[19:08] Twisol: I can try again quick and get back to you
[19:08] isaacs: did you list it as a bundled dependency?  i mean, maybe they're using npm to build a tarball or some such
[19:09] isaacs: in which case, the node_modules will fall out, if it's not explicitly bundled.
[19:09] Twisol: No, I don't think I did
[19:09] avalanche123 has joined the channel
[19:09] isaacs: but if they're actually removing it, i can't help you
[19:09] Twisol: Unless you supported relative paths ;)
[19:09] Aikar: isaacs: did you change npm to require listing everything in bundledDependencies in order to not get deleted on package creation for publish? my node_modules dir is disappearing which had other files in it, ie stuff not listed as dependency...
[19:09] Twisol: I'll get back to you about what Heroku does, at any rate
[19:10] isaacs: Aikar: yes, anythingin node_modules that is not in bundleDependencies will be left behind
[19:10] Aikar: :/ why?
[19:10] isaacs: Aikar: the problem is that people were accidentlaly publishing a lot of garbage.
[19:10] isaacs: express was coming along with dnode and crap
[19:10] isaacs: node_modules should be for dependencies.  dependencies should be listed, and explicitly bundled if desire.
[19:11] isaacs: *desired
[19:11] bartt has joined the channel
[19:11] Aikar: so i have a node_modules/mylib.js that symlinks to ../mylib.js so i can do require('mylib') in examples/tests instead of relative (makes for more reasonable code that people will be using...) how would you define that?

[19:12] NetRoY has joined the channel
[19:12] Twisol: aikar: require.paths?
[19:12] isaacs: Aikar: have your tests not do that, or run your tests with NODE_MODULES=$PWD/.. node test/foo/
[19:12] Aikar: Twisol: no thats not a solution :P
[19:13] isaacs: Twisol: yeah, deprecated
[19:13] Aikar: ugh.. can we have that "feature" turned off by config?
[19:13] isaacs: Aikar: to set the require.paths, set the NODE_PATH env var
[19:13] maligree has joined the channel
[19:14] isaacs: (not NODE_MODULES as i wrote above, that's a typo)
[19:14] Aikar: i dont wanna go through all that crap
[19:14] isaacs: Aikar: so put it in your bashrc
[19:14] Aikar: my npm publish should work just the same as my tarball/git checkout
[19:14] isaacs: Aikar: dude, just list it as a dependency, and bundle it.
[19:14] isaacs: git and npm are different tools, they aren't 100% the same, and shouldn't be.
[19:14] Aikar: thats what i sorta asked, was how would i define that to make it not be deleted
[19:15] isaacs: "bundleDependencies": ["mylib"]
[19:15] isaacs: cd node_modules; ln -s .. mylib
[19:15] isaacs: that *may* cause crazy recursion...
[19:15] Aikar: would still like a config option to disable that though
[19:16] Twisol: D:
[19:16] isaacs: the standard way to do this is to have your tests load modules using relative paths.
[19:16] isaacs: it's less important that tests *look* like user code, and more important that they *act* like user code.
[19:16] isaacs: you want to be 100% sure that your tests are loading the code you think they are, or else they're not valid tests.  relative paths.  super reliable.
[19:17] Aikar: isaacs: more so meant it for examples
[19:18] isaacs: oh, ok
[19:18] Twisol: isaacs: Wait... Based on this discussion, npm wipes out node_modules/ when installing?
[19:18] Aikar: when publishing
[19:18] Twisol: Ahh.
[19:19] isaacs: Twisol: except for the entries in bundleDependencies
[19:19] Twisol: So not really related to the Heroku thing. Rats, it would've made sense :S
[19:19] isaacs: when publishing, installing globally, or anything else that adds a folder to the cache folder
[19:20] isaacs: hm.. seems this isn't very well documented.
[19:20] isaacs: it should live at http://npmjs.org/doc/pack.html probably

[19:37] Aikar: Twisol: no, youll need to make a makefile for your project that executes that modules build steps
[19:37] mjr_ has joined the channel
[19:38] Twisol: so we're back to having to do something extra because you can't specify a local directory. :(
[19:38] Aikar: easiest thing to do is look at the package.json step that it lists for npm to run to build it, and paste  that exact line (with updated paths etc) into your make file
[19:38] Twisol: Aikar: When is the makefile run?
[19:38] sirdancealot has joined the channel
[19:38] Aikar: yours or theirs?
[19:38] zemanel has joined the channel
[19:39] isaacs: Twisol: dude, just put it in your package, and run the things to build it
[19:39] chance-: Twisol: better question is if you can alter the makefile on heroku
[19:39] Aikar: youll then need to define a command in YOUR package.json to run 'make'
[19:39] chance-: my guess is no
[19:39] isaacs: "scripts": { "preinstall": "cd ./thing; make" }
[19:39] Twisol: hm, k
[19:39] Aikar: or do that if its simple like that
[19:39] ttpva has joined the channel
[19:39] isaacs: or "scripts": { "preinstall" : "cd ./thing; node-waf configure build" }
[19:39] isaacs: and then put it in "thing" and require("../thing/blah.node")
[19:40] Twisol: Sorry, I'm just not used to having to deal with this sort of thing.

[19:53] DrMcKay: isaacs: just a friendly notice, glob doesn't compile with v0.5
[19:54] Twisol: chance-: since it had a wscript in it, npm automatically compiled it when it was pushed up, so that's all I had to do

[20:03] CoverSlide: at that point, I would just switch to json
[20:04] DrMcKay: bradleymeck: sorry, I thought it's possible by modyfing env, but turns out it's not
[20:04] bradleymeck: ini is a pretty simple format im sure a patch to iniparser wouldnt take as long as the maintainance of doing odd things
[20:04] Aikar: im at json now, but the sys admins who manage production wont be happy if im like "yo, your use to ini files, now use json"

[20:05] Aikar: bad? no, not that useful if you have problems/ yeah
[20:05] Aikar: i guess since my current configs are simple depth anyways its ok for now

[20:13] Me1000 has joined the channel
[20:13] Aikar: so you can store more than 4gb of data on a 32bit system
[20:13] `3rdEden: brb swapping Macs

This has come as a surprise to a lot of people who are used to not having to worry about that.  The reason for this is that the MongoDB storage engine uses memory-mapped files for performance."

[22:05] EyePulp: stagas: any idea how to get a debug printout of the req/res objects after proxy.proxyRequest() has its way with them?
[22:05] tobie has joined the channel
[22:06] stagas: EyePulp: what kind of debug
[22:06] normanrichards has joined the channel
[22:07] EyePulp: well, I'd like to figure out what it's doing to the request object once it gets it - I get a different response from one of the servers I'm hitting when going through the proxy versus browsing directly.

[22:11] schwab has joined the channel
[22:14] stagas: EyePulp: it repeats the request as a new client to the target server and pipes the response back to the original res object
[22:15] stagas: EyePulp: so I guess you can attach events to the res object as usual
[22:15] nerdy_ has joined the channel
[22:16] \ask has joined the channel
[22:16] stagas: EyePulp: I'm not sure what you're trying to do
[22:17] EyePulp: stagas: I think I follow what you mean - there shouldn't be an real modification the proxy is adding to the request.
[22:17] diamonddog: is there a good tutorial on how to create nodejs cpp modules ?
[22:17] \ask: hi everyone - using express.js, I set res.local('user') in my code, but it's not available in the view.  If I set res.local('user2') it is. 
[22:18] \ask: is this expected?
[22:18] EyePulp: stagas: I'm just running into a different response from a proxy based request versus a browser based request.
[22:19] AvianFlu: EyePulp: can you gist your code?
[22:20] \ask: oh, doh -- just realized I had a dynamicHelpers setup for user.  Gah!
[22:20] stagas: EyePulp: it adds a few headers for the original client info as those change since it's a new request, like remoteAddress, but the rest should be the same
[22:21] mraleph has joined the channel
[22:21] EyePulp: AvianFlu: I'll need to clean out a lot of company stuff - so probably not yet.  when I get more desperate… probably will become a gist
[22:21] AvianFlu: I understand
[22:22] AvianFlu: you have to change req.headers.host if you're going to a remote server... that may help you
[22:22] AvianFlu: or not
[22:22] EyePulp: Though the process of cleaning out usually solves a lot of things… =)

[23:39] tjholowaychuk: node-static supports a lot less than connect's static()

[23:40] dynacker: how does node-static compare to nginx :>?

[23:47] shipit has joined the channel
[23:47] TooTallNate: spolu: that would simply create a persistent reference to an existing JS object
[23:48] TooTallNate: said object would be allocated on V8's heap though
[23:48] Me1000 has joined the channel
[23:48] spolu: TooTallNate: so to remove an object from V8 heap I would need to "deeply" copy it into a pure C++ newly allocated C++ object right?

[23:50] TooTallNate: spolu: why not just hang onto the Persistent handle and return the original JS object back when needed?

[23:51] ggg_: Ive got a feeling the upload process from the client to server (cloud9) aint working properly

[23:51] tjholowaychuk: nope

[23:52] dreamdust: A web-based IDE? That's interesting...
[23:53] TooTallNate: spolu: right, it's *just* a reference
[23:53] TooTallNate: you *could* copy properties from a JS object that you need to a C++ object, and save C++ objects
[23:53] tjholowaychuk: nope
[23:53] TooTallNate: then convert them back to JS objects when needed
[23:53] tjholowaychuk: my bad
[23:53] TooTallNate: but like I said, probably overkill/overoptimization
[23:53] spolu: TooTallNate: I have ~500mb heap. That's >1s mark-sweep/compact
