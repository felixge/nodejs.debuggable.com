[00:23] jellosea: it traverses through the ast and each node has a type right?
[00:23] jellosea: and then pased on the node type it does a replacement  right?
[00:23] eboyjr: clifton: yeah, why?
[00:24] clifton: does the terminal window interrmittenly resize itself when you alt tab around
[00:24] clifton: or create new tabs?
[00:24] clifton: its been happening ever since i upgraded to lion and its pretty annoying, was just wondering if anyone else dealt with that issue

[00:39] johnduhart has joined the channel

[05:19] levity_island has joined the channel
[05:19] Asmor: Was just checking the node homepage, and noticed that 0.5.2 is listed as unstable. That might explain the problem partially.
[05:20] Asmor: 0.4.10 is the last stable release
[05:20] sounko: as tmzt said
[05:20] sounko: you can build 0.4.9 which will just make a node.exe
[05:20] sounko: in the sbin folder
[05:20] sounko: then you can replace that exe with the 0.5.2 .exe on the website
[05:21] sounko: because all cygwin does is allow you to use the shell rather than cmd

[06:54] jesusabdullah: zdwalter: People are using node.js in the "real world" if that's what youre asking.
[06:54] indutny: zdwalter: YES
[06:54] jesusabdullah: zdwalter: browserling.com, nodejitsu.com and learnboost.com all use it internally, a *lot*
[06:54] jesusabdullah: if not exclusively
[06:54] zdwalter: yes, real world~
[06:55] jesusabdullah: github uses it to serve up tarballs, last I checked
[06:55] jesusabdullah: Yahoo was using it for something, not sure what, but they definitely had some node guys working for them at one point in time
[06:56] zdwalter: I am using it for a back-end service. but it runs out of memory every few hours
[06:56] jesusabdullah: It's not the sort of thing people tend to pick if they're conservative, want something 400 provens, but plenty of people are using it for real-world stuff without too much difficulty
[06:56] zdwalter: trying to find out why, with node-inspector
[06:57] pquerna: zdwalter: what version; anything its doing heavily?
[06:57] pquerna: zdwalter: out of memory = out of heap or somehting else?
[06:57] clifton: i wrote a node app to handle uploads and do image manipulation for my company
[06:57] clifton: had some processes up for months without any noticable leaks

[07:02] jesusabdullah: (j/k)
[07:02] zdwalter: it's a front-end for redis, and a task-dispatcher
[07:03] zdwalter: doesn't use in-memory cache, I think
[07:03] pquerna: which redis client?
[07:03] pquerna: there have been leaks in some of them iirc
[07:03] pquerna: (but I don't use redis+node much)

[07:13] Nuck: I have 2 lines: (1) create an fd (2) pipe the body to it
[07:13] Nuck: But how do I create a temp file again, is it just .unlink() on it?
[07:16] clifton: how long are you keeping the file around
[07:16] Nuck: as long as I need to.
[07:16] Nuck: Or wait
[07:16] Nuck: Can't use unlinking, now that I think about it :V
[07:16] Nuck: nevermind lol
[07:17] gg777 has joined the channel
[07:17] clifton: just make a writestream and pipe the upload to it
[07:17] Nuck: 'tis what I do
[07:17] Nuck: I think I'll just set a timeout of like half an hour before the upload disappears
[07:18] clifton: if you end up with lots of files
[07:21] clifton: you could have subdirectories with the name of the timestamp set, then just programmatically delete old directories after X many minutes

[08:44] japj: hmm are you tring to compile 0.5.x btw, since v8 build in latest master github is currently broken in cygwin. you might want to give mingw a try (that works ok for me)
[08:46] Henke:  I used the latest build as of yesterday to install, so probably 0.5.2
[08:46] japj: node on windows is currently worked heavily on as part of the 0.5 tree. if you don't need to actually build it, you can also grab the official windows binary from the nodejs download page
[08:47] Henke: ah so they got a binary now? Last time I checked (a few months ago) this was the only way to install that I found
[08:47] japj: but BEWARE 0.5.x is under heavy construction on windows, so not everything is working yet
[08:48] japj: for 0.5.2+ they are building official windows binaries
[08:48] blaenk: yeah I read (supposedly) that even microsoft was gonna help with node dev for windows

[08:58] japj: but there is an alternative on windows for the moment
[08:58] Henke: what's that alternative?
[08:58] japj: get https://github.com/japj/ryppi (it is a "really super scaled down featureless node package manager for node" written in python)

[09:07] japj: as far as I can tell, it will not magically create the directory for you. it'll just fire the error event

[10:46] saschagehlich: yeah that's what I thought as well... whatever, it works :) thx sriley
[10:47] ngs has joined the channel
[10:48] japj: lng: I havent used daemon.node myself, so I don't know exactly how other people use it. 'node-waf configure build' does not install anything though
[10:49] japj: lng: you will end up with a daemon.node that you can use with require("./daemon"), so if you copy daemon.node to wherever you need it then you can probably remove the daemon.node sources

[14:05] edude03: Yeah I wanted to avoid firewall issues by having both run over 80, but then I'd have to reverse proxy on the server side

[14:14] sriley: its fairly simple to set up tbh
[14:15] edude03: Well I'm still going to look for a simpler solution because I think this stack is getting out of control for what feels like a simple app
[14:15] edude03: That I probably could have just developed in node but whatever 
[14:16] edude03: sriley: Want to tell me a but about your setup though :)
[14:16] sriley: well its best to put node behind nginx anyway for security since node is still fairly new it could be susceptible to malformed headers etc

[15:12] Raynos: How does one update server-side code without taking a server down

[15:13] brianc has joined the channel
[15:14] Raynos: maushu: Is ther eany reading material
[15:14] maushu: Basically, don't use global variables, have a "dispose" function to unhook events and all that.
[15:14] maushu: That I know, no.
[15:15] maushu: Raynos, but if you are using this for development, there is stuff that restarts the server when it detects changes in code.
[15:15] Raynos: maushu: I want to avoid restarting the server
[15:15] Raynos: You cant disconnect connected users
[15:15] Raynos: but any new connections should use the new code
[15:15] maushu: Yeah, then you have to do what i said.
[15:16] al3xnull has joined the channel
[15:16] maushu: Have code that handles receiving the connections and putting in some array or something.
[15:17] maushu: Then code that you want to change that has functions that do stuff.
[15:18] maushu: Don't use global variables and have a dispose function to unhook events.
[15:18] Raynos: The hard bit is handling socket.io based code
[15:18] maushu: Hmm.
[15:18] Raynos: HTTP is fine. I would be a pain to safely change code connected to open websockets
[15:18] maushu: You need to keep some code unchangeable.
[15:19] maushu: Mostly the connection handlers (eg: socket.io).

[17:14] chjj: 127.x.x.x is just a reserved ip block by ietf for local ips
[17:14] jetienne: insulina: listen to 0.0.0.0 and not to 127.0.0.1
[17:15] svenlito has joined the channel
[17:16] chjj: insulina, if you have an ip, add it as an A record on godaddy, otherwise you can use a cname, and then listen on port 80 on your node

[17:20] mscdex: catb0t: hey hey 16k, what does that get you today?
[17:20] mscdex: :(
[17:20] catb0t: today , i that answer should be a simple bug, somewhere, and you can hot load modules in your server
[17:21] chjj: insulina, what are you using to host your node?
[17:21] mscdex: insulina: you can just do .listen(8080); and it will listen on all interfaces

[18:31] Foxster has joined the channel
[18:31] ercu: after i changed the code of course.
[18:31] Foxster: Hosting question - are there any managed hosts that 1. support websockets at this point and 2. are in open beta/available?
[18:32] brainproxy: ercu: what's the setup look like? where is the code that you changed in relation to how you installed the code / npm package
[18:33] Corren_ has joined the channel
[18:34] dshaw_ has joined the channel
[18:36] ercu: i installed it via npm install -g node.io,  i see required js files in my_folder/node_modules/node.io/lib. no binary files is exist.
[18:37] guidocalvano has joined the channel
[18:37] brainproxy: ercu: installation with -g is different than normal installation; i'm not familiar with node.io, but how are you invoking it?
[18:38] amiller has joined the channel
[18:38] brainproxy: seems like a global installation would not be affected by changes made to the path you described

[18:39] brainproxy: which node.io
[18:39] tekky has joined the channel
[18:40] ercu: brainproxy: i don't know what you mean exactly but i invoke it by regular node code. i just changed a line in a lib js file. see here: https://github.com/chriso/node.io/issues/43
[18:40] m00p has joined the channel
[18:41] brainproxy: ercu: the node.io page suggests a global installation and then using a node.io command via the shell
[18:41] brainproxy: so I wasn't sure if that's how you're using it
[18:41] brainproxy: or if you're doing `require('node.io')` in one of your scripts or what exactly
[18:42] marcab has joined the channel
[18:42] ercu: yes node.io is run from the shell, and in code i use require('node.io')

[19:03] DrPizza_: turning off quick edit is infuriating
[19:03] mscdex: man, 6 minutes and 18 seconds to compile node on cygwin
[19:03] mscdex: atrocious
[19:03] DrPizza_: including compiling V8 and everything?
[19:04] mscdex: yeah
[19:04] brainproxy: ercu: okay any luck?
[19:04] DrPizza_: on what hardware?
[19:04] brainproxy: or you still want some help?

[19:04] mscdex: heck yeah
[19:05] mscdex: why else am i using cygwin?
[19:05] mscdex: ;-)
[19:05] ercu: brainproxy: in fact i just want to know if i need any commands to run, after i change some code in a module
[19:05] brainproxy: it depends on how the code was installed
[19:05] mscdex: i'd gladly use mingw in a heartbeat
[19:05] brainproxy: see, if you do a global (-g) install, then the code is in a different place than if you install without -g
[19:05] DrPizza_: I need to poke at zlib a little (the zlib project files are stupid and don't bother to compile their assembler routines) and make openssl use zlib, I should have nice VC++ builds working for the entire lot
[19:06] DrPizza_: though I'm guessing VC++ 2010 isn't much use for NT4
[19:06] DrPizza_: heh
[19:06] brainproxy: e.g. if i'm in /home/me/project
[19:06] brainproxy: and in do `npm install express`
[19:06] brainproxy: then I'll get code installed in `/home/me/project/node_modules/express`
[19:06] brainproxy: whereas if I do a global install

[19:06] brainproxy: it goes in, well for me using nvm it does in
[19:06] DrPizza_: mscdex: my fork is mostly working pretty well
[19:07] mscdex: i'm not sure even if .net works on nt4
[19:07] DrPizza_: heh
[19:07] DrPizza_: why NT4!
[19:07] DrPizza_: jesus 15 years old 
[19:07] mscdex: legacy app

[19:07] DrPizza_: wow, 15 years old **today**
[19:08] DrPizza_: it went RTM 31st august 1996.
[19:08] mscdex: today?
[19:08] mscdex: it's july
[19:08] mscdex: :-D
[19:08] brainproxy: ercu: when you're using `require(...)` the idea is that you have it installed "locally"
[19:08] saikat has joined the channel
[19:08] brainproxy: global is usually associated with tools that expose some commands you'll run in the shell
[19:08] DrPizza_: mscdex: er

[19:08] DrPizza_: mscdex: yes I meant 31st july
[19:08] DrPizza_: retail was 24th august
[19:09] brainproxy: and so you'll need to modify the code in that lib/node_modules folder, i.e. the location of the global package installation

[19:10] mscdex: i could use a newer os, but the legacy app has crappier performance on anything newer than nt4
[19:10] brainproxy: and have did you "invoke" the local one
[19:10] mscdex: don't ask me why though
[19:10] brainproxy: through the shell command or via `require(...)`
[19:10] brainproxy: ?
[19:10] DrPizza_: mscdex: er, put legacy app in VM, use something else for actual useful work?
[19:10] brainproxy: and *how did...
[19:10] mscdex: the legacy app IS in a vm
[19:10] ercu: var nodeio = require('node.io');   
[19:10] mscdex: heh
[19:10] mscdex: i use linux for my node work
[19:11] DrPizza_: well I assumed so with only 1 core

[19:11] brainproxy: $ node
[19:11] brainproxy: then...
[19:12] DrPizza_: mscdex: no doubt.
[19:12] brainproxy: > require.resolve('node.io')
[19:12] DrPizza_: my core 2 duo is pretty sad alas.
[19:12] mscdex: but luckily cygwin performs just good enough to keep up with data from node_pcap
[19:13] DrPizza_: what's the situation with getting useful stack traces?
[19:13] DrPizza_: how likely is that to happen any time soon?

[20:39] Sembiance: hrm... mongoose seems like the totally wrong thing to put on top of mongodb. The first thing you appear to have to do to use mongoose is define a schema. ROFL. on top of mongodb, famous for being schema-less
[20:40] boaz has joined the channel
[20:40] bazookatooth: what is rofl about defining a schema
[20:40] nibblebot: managing a schema in your app is much different than hard coding it in your database
[20:40] maushu: Would it be better to just loop all properties in a object and insert it?

[20:56] Sembiance: maushu: this sums up mongoose perfectly: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/mongoose-orm/Bj9KTjI0NAQ/ZsYQ50tqVzYJ
[20:56] Sembiance: Quote: "Mongoose is "the way you access mongo when you want schema and transaction features." It is not an attempt to monopolise access to mongo and channel all possible applications through Mongoose. It is an application of the ActiveRecord pattern, and there are plenty of use cases in which ActiveRecord is undesirable."
[20:57] maushu: hmm
[20:57] Sembiance: Basically, you shouldn't look at mongoose as a mongodb client. It's a schema-full active-record based ORM module
[20:57] Sembiance: since I only want a mongodb client, mongoose is vast overkill and not what I need :)

[21:09] xerox: it is, it's just very limited, but that is only my opinion
[21:09] shimondoodkin: robertka: ahh i know i had this, maybe you have not defined the fined in the model
[21:09] xerox: your problem of course has nothing to do with that, but I had to ditch it after writing serious enough code with it because of how the cool stuff does not play well together
[21:10] xerox: if I knew that at the beginning I would have just used node-mongodb-native which is p good
[21:10] robertka: i defined all the stuff i use in the model

[23:29] blaenk: hey, just wondering, being new to all this. is there a way to add a shebang line at the top of a node script and +x it so I can just do ./script ?
[23:30] levity_island: blaenk: the shebang is interpreted by the shell, so it should work if you give it the path to your node interpreter
[23:30] levity_island: node executable, i mean
[23:30] blaenk: levity_island: beaitufl thanks! I wonder if I can ues the env node thing
[23:30] blaenk: worth a try :D

[23:33] brainproxy: blaenk: you may also want to take a look at nvm
[23:33] blaenk: is it the rvm of node lol
[23:34] brainproxy: yep

[23:34] brainproxy: though it doesn't do the equivalent of "gem sets"
[23:34] nphyx_: it's still win.
[23:34] brainproxy: as localized npm / node_modules install makes that unnecessary

[23:35] brainproxy: the original maintainer's repo needs to be patched to support how the tar.gz files are being distributed for v0.5.1+
[23:35] spice has joined the channel
[23:35] brainproxy: but it's still fine for the v0.4.x stuff, and some of the recent forks were specifically for that purpose
